AbsTrACT background Mental health problems are prevalent among patients seeking primary healthcare. However, traditional patient interviews often fail to identify and manage these problems. Therefore, an improved patient interview process is needed to assess and treat mental health problems in primary care settings. Aims To assess the validity, reliability, sensitivity and specificity of a 5Step Patient Interview approach for the screening, diagnosis and treatment of mental health problems. Design and setting This study compared a 5Step Patient Interview approach (AlKhathami approach) with expert psychiatric interviews based on the Structured Clinical Interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition, the Patient Health Questionnaire9 (PHQ9) and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder7 (GAD7) questionnaire from 1 January 2020 to 30 April 2020 in family practice or primary healthcare centres. Methods A total of 760 participants from five Saudi Arabian regions were selected using a multiclustered random sample of every third patient aged \u226518 years, drawn from the clinics\u2019 patient list. results A total of 732 patients agreed to participate, with a response rate of 96.3%; 396 (54.1%) were women; the mean (Standard Deviation) age was 41.28 (14.30) years (ranging from 18 to 84 years). Mental health problems were suspected in 40% of the participants. The 5Step Patient Interview approach was shown to be comparable to an expert interview by a psychiatrist. Moreover, it was more accurate than the PHQ9 and GAD7 selfadministered questionnaires in screening for stress and classifying it as mild, moderate to severe or severe. Additionally, the 5Step Patient Interview approach improved physicianpatient communication by encouraging the exploration of patients\u2019 perspectives. Conclusions The 5Step Patient Interview approach is a valid, reliable tool that can aid the integration of mental healthcare into primary healthcare and family practice. Future studies should evaluate the implementation outcomes of the 5Step Patient Interview approach.",

The research questions are as follows: (1) Is the 5- Step Patient Interview a promising clinical screening tool for identifying mental health issues, including psychological stress, in primary healthcare patients? (2) Is the 5- Step Patient Interview as accurate, effective and reliable as evaluation by expert psychiatrists, the Patient Health Questionnaire- 9 (PHQ- 9) and the Generalised Anxiety Disorder- 7 (GAD- 7) in detecting, diagnosing and managing the mental health needs of primary healthcare patients?\nMETHoDs study design and setting This study compared a new, five- step structured clinical interview for screening mental health needs in primary healthcare centre patients with structured psychiatric interviews based on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, fifth edition (DSM- 5), the PHQ- 9 and the GAD- 7 questionnaire. It was conducted at primary\nhealthcare settings in Saudi Arabia from 1 January 2020 to 30 April 2020.\nsampling procedure A multiclustered random sample was selected from 10 primary healthcare centres in 5 areas of Saudi Arabia: the north, south, east, west and central regions. Two primary healthcare centres per cluster were randomly selected. Study participants were recruited by choosing every third patient from the patient list of the enrolled clinics or the next eligible patient.\nPatient interview stages and data collection Patients enrolled in the study were interviewed in three stages (figure 1).\nStage 1: a family doctor assessed the enrolled patients using the 5- Step Patient Interview approach to guide the qualitative interviews (online supplemental box S1).\nStage 2: an expert psychiatrist interviewed the same patients using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM Disorders, fifth edition (SCID- 5) and the Mini- Mental State Examination (MMSE).5\nStage 3: these patients then completed a selfadministered questionnaire containing three parts: sociodemographic data, the PHQ- 9 for depression and the GAD- 7 questionnaire.6 7 Stress severity was classified as mild and moderate to severe based on the PHQ- 9 and GAD- 7 scores.\nsample size The sample size was calculated according to the prevalence of mental disorders in primary healthcare centres\nFigure 1 Flowchart of study enrolment.

Cross- tabulations (2\u00d72) were used to calculate the sensitivity and specificity of the 5- Step Patient Interview approach. A \u03c72 test was applied to assess the psychometric properties (internal consistency, concurrent validity and reliability) of the 5- Step Patient Interview. The 95% confidence interval (CI) and p <0.05 were used to determine statistical significance.\nSimple linear regression was used to test the correlation between stress severity and the 5- Step Patient Interview by assessing sleep disturbance: none (no sleep problems), mild (early insomnia), moderate to severe (interrupted sleep) and severe (late insomnia); and the PHQ- 9 and GAD- 7 classification scores were considered as no affected stress (score <5), mild (score=5\u20139), and moderate to severe (score >10). Additionally, simple linear regression was used to test the correlation between the severity of stress\u2014from moderate to severe\u2014as indicated by the PHQ- 9 and GAD- 7 scores >10 and the 5- Step Patient Interview measures screening for psychological stress, including a decreased performance of responsibilities, a marked decline in concentration, feelings of isolation, and anger easily triggered in social relationships.\nThe Durbin- Watson (DW) test was applied to exclude the effect of autoregression on the correlation between the new 5- Step Patient Interview and the existing (PHQ- 9 and GAD- 7) tool classifications. Additionally, an analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was used to determine any statistically significant differences between the new and existing tools. The coefficient results were used to assess the validity of the new approach. The standard deviation test was used to test predictability. The p <0.05 was the cutoff point for significance. Internal reliability to measure the consistency of results with the 5- Step Patient Interview was assessed using Cronbach\u2019s alpha reliability analysis with a cut- off point > 0.70; the data were all \u2018items\u2019 scores related to screening, diagnosis and management in the 5- Step Patient Interview, the PHQ- 9, the GAD- 7 and the interviews by expert psychiatrists. Then the credibility of the internal reliability was strengthened using Spearman\u2019s qualitative correlation coefficient.\nThe 5-step Patient Interview approach (AlKhathami approach) Step 1: suspect mental health problems This step is the core of this approach. Based on a literature review and practical experience, three patient\ngroups were selected and considered more prone to mental health problems."

The major symptoms of anxiety are anxious mood and fear. This step entails the use of the self- administered PHQ- 2 and GAD- 2.7 23\nStep 5: manage mild mental health problems This step applies the principles of the WHO mhGAP Guide V.2.0.22 The mild symptoms (ie, early insomnia) identified by the 5- Step Patient Interview are equivalent to those based on the GAD- 7 and PHQ- 9 and do not immediately require medication.6 24 Physicians should start the patient on non- pharmacological treatment, including improved sleep hygiene, regular exercise, stress relaxation and supportive therapy. Pharmacological treatment can be initiated if the patient\u2019s situation worsens or does not respond to the former interventions.22 23 Antidepressants should be considered for moderate to severe cases of mental health problems, except for the following situations: (1) post- triggering events. Examples include domestic or other violence victims, grief due to losing loved ones, natural disasters, etc. Narrative therapy should be provided as the first intervention to help patients cope with their problems before considering antidepressant treatment (online supplemental box S2); (2) drug side effects affecting mood. When mood changes occur following the administration of drugs such as beta- blockers, contraceptive pills and steroids, physicians should modify the medication before initiating antidepressant therapy.\nrEsuLTs Main results Of the 760 selected participants, 732 participants enrolled in the study (96.3% response rate); 396 (54.1%) were women and the mean (Standard Deviation) age was 41.28 (14.30) years (range: 18\u201384 years). The study results followed and were based on the five steps of the patient interview.\nStep 1: suspect mental health problems\u2014the target group of patients requiring mental healthcare. Forty percent of all participants were suspected of having mental health problems. Table 1 illustrates the prevalence of mental health problems in the group with suspected mental health problems compared with those without any suspected mental health issues. The 5- Step Patient Interview approach detected patients with mental illness as well as the expert psychiatric interview.\nStep 2: screen for suspected stress- related mental health problems. The 5- Step Patient Interview identified the level of stress severity similar to that found by the PHQ- 9 and GAD- 7. The 5- Step Patient Interview model was highly correlated with the PHQ- 9 (R=0.767 and R2=0.59) and GAD- 7 (R=0.692 and R2=0.48) classifications of stress severity, with Sig- F change <0.001 for both compressions. In addition, the DW values (1.879 and 1.969, respectively), which indicated an autoregression effect, were close to 2, indicating no autoregression effect.\nThe ANOVA test results for the 5- Step Patient Interview approach compared with the PHQ- 9 and GAD- 7 were F=1015.56 (p<0.001) and F=655.92 (p<0.001), respectively. The coefficient results of the comparison of the 5- Step Patient Interview with the PHQ- 9 were B0 (constant)=0.260 (p<0.001) and B1 (stress level)=0.793 (p<0.001), indicating highly significant credibility (79.3%) of the new model compared with the PHQ- 9. The coefficient results of the comparison of the 5- Step Patient Interview with the GAD- 7 were B0 (constant)=0.152 (p<0.001) and B1 (stress level)=0.646 (p<0.001), indicating high credibility (65%) compared with the GAD- 7. The sleep indicator coefficients with the PHQ- 9 were B0 (constant)=0.319 (p<0.001) and B1 (sleep grading)=0.880 (p<0.001). The coefficient results with GAD- 7 were B0\nP atna).

Concerning the model\u2019s predictability, the SD was 1.0, indicating that the 5- Step Patient Interview model for stress classification predicts depression and generalised anxiety disorder well.\nThe sensitivity and specificity of the 5- Step Patient Interview stress indicators were compared with the PHQ- 9 and GAD- 7 measures. For defining stress as related to sleep disturbance, the 5- Step model had a high sensitivity (66.1% (232/351) vs 70.6% (192/272)) and a high specificity (89.5% (341/381) vs 82.6% (380/460)), with a significant correlation (\u03c72=235.99 vs \u03c72=203.19) (p<0.001 for both) compared with PHQ- 9 and GAD- 7 (table 2). In addition, a decline in performance assessed in the 5- Step Patient Interview was considered to indicate moderate to severe stress with a sensitivity (54.1% (98/181)) and a high specificity (96.9% (534/551)) (\u03c72=257.23, p<0.001) compared with PHQ- 9, and a sensitivity of 54.9% (73/133) and a specificity of 93.0% (557/599) (\u03c72=183.19, p<0.001) compared with GAD- 7 (table 3). Finally, the 5- Step Patient Interview approach found an adverse impact of mental health problems on social relationships. It indicated moderate to severe stress with a sensitivity of 24.9% (45/181)and a high specificity of 99.1% (546/551), with a significant correlation (\u03c72=257.23, p<0.001) compared with PHQ- 9. Moreover, it had a sensitivity of 27.8%\n(37/133) and a specificity of 97.8% (586/599), with a significant correlation (\u03c72=183.19, p<0.001) compared with GAD- 7 (table 4).\nStep 3: scope best service options to address more severe mental health problems. The 5- Step Patient Interview model was highly sensitive (96.0% (24/25)) and specific (100.0% (707/707)) in determining whether a patient should be followed up at a primary healthcare centre or referred to a mental health specialist when compared with an expert psychiatrist assessment and showed a significant correlation (\u03c72=697.89, p<0.001), as demonstrated in table 5. Only 24 (3.3%) patients required referral to psychiatric clinics; two- thirds of these patients (n=16) were diagnosed with schizophrenia. Thus, most patients were treated at primary healthcare centres.\nStep 4: diagnose depression and anxiety. The 5- Step Patient Interview approach was compared with expert psychiatric evaluation and the PHQ- 9 and GAD- 7 for the diagnosis of depression and anxiety. A total of 262 (35.8%), 230 (31.4%) and 383 (52.3%) patients with mental health problems were diagnosed using the 5- Step Patient Interview approach, an expert psychiatrist evaluation, and the PHQ- 9 and GAD- 7 questionnaires, respectively. The 5- Step Patient Interview had a sensitivity of 96.1% (221/230) and a specificity of 91.8% (461/502) compared with the expert psychiatrist diagnosis, with a significant correlation (\u03c72=511.67, p<0.001).

It has been proven effective in nurturing good relationships between doctors and patients, thus enhancing patient compliance to treatment plans and reducing drug prescriptions.15\nAlthough screening for mental health problems at primary healthcare centres is recommended, the available screening tools are time- consuming, limiting their application in busy clinics.15 The 5- Step Patient Interview approach addresses this by shortening the screening time for mental health problems, as recommended by Berwick et al, who emphasised the need for shortened screening questionnaires.26 Dugdale et al stated that the interview length is unrelated to its quality.27 Goldberg et al also showed that treating mental illnesses at primary healthcare centres is faster, ensures care continuity, improves patient satisfaction and reduces healthcare costs.4\nIntegration of mental healthcare into primary healthcare services triggers questions about the scope of mental health services offered at the primary healthcare level.8 The 5- Step Patient Interview model empowers primary healthcare physicians with a clear scope of practice, as recommended by WHO28 and emphasised by Shidhaye et al.1"
