1. **Investigate the relationship between object attributes and model robustness.** The paper finds that models are more sensitive to certain object attributes, such as background complexity and object size. Future research could explore the relationship between these attributes and model robustness in more detail. For example, researchers could investigate how the complexity of the background affects the model's ability to recognize objects, or how the size of the object affects the model's ability to classify it.
2. **Develop new methods for generating images with controlled object attributes.** The paper uses a diffusion model to generate images with controlled object attributes. Future research could explore other methods for generating such images. For example, researchers could investigate the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) or variational autoencoders (VAEs) for this task.
3. **Create new datasets of images with controlled object attributes.** The paper creates a new dataset of images with controlled object attributes, called ImageNet-E. Future research could create new datasets of this type, with different object attributes and different levels of complexity. These datasets could be used to evaluate the robustness of models to different types of attribute changes.
4. **Develop new methods for training models that are robust to object attribute changes.** The paper finds that some models are more robust to object attribute changes than others. Future research could explore new methods for training models that are robust to these changes. For example, researchers could investigate the use of adversarial training or data augmentation to improve the robustness of models to attribute changes.
5. **Investigate the relationship between model robustness and real-world performance.** The paper evaluates the robustness of models on a dataset of images with controlled object attributes. Future research could investigate the relationship between model robustness on this dataset and model performance on real-world tasks. For example, researchers could evaluate the performance of models on tasks such as object detection and image classification in real-world settings.
