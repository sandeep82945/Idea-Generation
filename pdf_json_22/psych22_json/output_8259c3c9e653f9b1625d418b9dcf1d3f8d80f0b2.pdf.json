Characterizing life-stage specific esilience processes is key to personalizing and, thus, optimizing detecion and design of intervention paradigms for vulnerable individuals. To ddress this issue, we examined the neural underpinnings of psychologial resilience against recent negative experiences (henceforth referred to s short-term resilience ) among adolescent and middle-aged female paricipants in the Human Connectome Project(HCP)-Development/Aging. hort-term resilience was defined as lower-than-expected psychopathol-\nril 2022\narticle under the CC BY-NC-ND license\no t h C\nw t l W t n s h T c t a t M c a c a 2 a a ( v t l i t h\na a t s d a 2 s m i l 2 b b\nt e r ( o d s c m c \u201c l\ns m o (\n( T c t v s\ni c c t E d e m i t p r t ( t c 0 b a d l t l T f y l r M F a\nb t t d t o d\nd i f c 2 S e r t ( T\nt e g l s D F\ngy (within the prior six months) relative to adversity experienced in he past year (i.e., number of adverse events over which the participant ad little or no control, cf. Amstadter et al., 2014 ; Bowes et al., 2010 ;\nollishaw et al., 2016 ; Rutter, 2013 ).\nOur investigation was inspired by theories of early life adversity hich posit that mechanisms underlying initial positive adjustment o environmental challenges may contribute to the long-term sequeae of stress exposure ( Belsky, 2019 ; McLaughlin et al., 2014, 2016 ).\ne thus sought to elucidate whether the neural substrates of shorterm resilience overlap those reportedly underpinning the long-term egative consequences of adversity and whether any observed relationhips would vary by life stage (i.e., adolescence versus middle adultood) ( Colich et al., 2020 ; Ramirez et al., 2020 ; Rasmussen et al., 2019 ;\nooley et al., 2021 ). Our focus was on accelerated brain and biologial aging, two well-documented sequelae of early life adversity predicive of later psychological vulnerability due to increased allostatic load nd poorer fine tuning of the slower developing association systems ransdiagnostically involved in psychopathology ( Colich et al., 2020 ;\ncLaughlin et al., 2020 ; McTeague et al., 2017 ; Tooley et al., 2021 ). In hildhood and adolescence, the two sequelae are likely interdependent, s pubertal hormones regulate brain maturation processes, while precoious functional neurodevelopment protects against accelerated cellular ging following stress exposure ( Eck and Bangasser, 2020 ; Laube et al., 020 ; Miller et al., 2020 ; Piekarski et al., 2017 ). Importantly, accelerted neurobiological aging in childhood and adolescence is regarded s an immediately adaptive response to adverse rearing environments Belsky, 2019 ; Rickard et al., 2014 ). Specifically, precocious brain deelopment, particularly for circuits relevant to emotion regulation, fosers successful coping, whereas earlier biological maturation (i.e., earier pubertal timing) is posited to be evolutionarily adaptive because t maximises reproductive opportunities before an anticipated premaure demise ( Belsky, 2019 ; Brieant et al., 2021 ; Callaghan and Totten-\nam, 2016 ; Gee et al., 2013 ).\nTo our knowledge, a link between accelerated neurobiological aging nd psychological resilience in middle adulthood has not been formally rticulated. Such an association is nonetheless plausible with regards o brain aging, if quicker recovery and/or greater active resistance to tressors in later life stem(s) partly from reduced reactivity and less ifferentiated processing of the external environment, both of which re putative key features of neural senescence ( Garrett et al., 2013 , 020 ; Grady and Garrett, 2018 ). In contrast, a positive link between reilience and accelerated biological aging, at least in the form of earlier\nenopausal onset, seems unlikely, given the role of ovarian hormones n dampening hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis activity folowing stress exposure ( Engel et al., 2019 ; Joffe et al., 2020 ; S\u00fcss et al.,\n021 ). Thus, if a relationship between biological aging and patterns of rain aging associated with resilience were to emerge, it would likely e negative.\nCapitalizing on the above reviewed literature, the present study ested the model represented in Fig. 1 . In short, adverse life experinces were expected to accelerate brain development/aging, both diectly ( Fig. 1 , a-c), and via speeded biological maturation ( Fig. 1 , a-b-c) Belsky, 2019 ; Colich et al., 2020 ). Our goal was to identify patterns f accelerated brain development/aging linked to resilience ( Fig. 1 , c) and probe their relevance to long-term psychological vulnerability, pecifically, risk for pathologies characterised by premature brain senesence ( Fig. 1 , c-e). We reasoned that earlier timing of brain develop-\nent/aging processes associated with short-term resilience in adolesence and middle adulthood could still reflect increased neurobiological wear and tear \u201d and, thus, be linked to cellular markers suggestive of ong-term risk for accelerated brain aging pathologies.\nBecause history of exposure to stressors can impact short-term reilience ( Kalisch et al., 2019 ), we sought to control for it through\narkers of key risk dimensions, such as deprivation (i.e., absence\nf expected environmental support [e.g., material, cognitive]), threat i.e., actual or potential exposure to violence), and unpredictability\nColich et al., 2020 ; Ellis et al., 2022 ; McLaughlin et al., 2021 ). hese dimensions overlapped the life domains assessed with the reent adverse events scales, specifically, financial difficulties, exposure o crime/physical violence, conflict, as well as unpredictable events inolving interpersonal loss (e.g., [parental] separation/divorce) or other ignificant life changes (e.g., change of residence/school).\nOur approach to controlling for prior stress exposure was grounded n evidence that dimensional operationalizations of adversity better apture long-term individual variability in neurodevelopmental outomes relative to cumulative risk measures, which are further prone o recall biases, particularly for adult samples ( Baldwin et al., 2019 ;\nllis et al., 2022 ; McLaughlin et al., 2021 ). Thus, the following inicators were used to estimate prior adversity exposure. First, global xposure to multiple dimensions of adversity was gauged through\neasures of socioeconomic status (SES) ( Colich et al., 2020 ). Specifcally, we used indices of income-to-needs, race and educational atainment, which reportedly encapsulate distinguishable experiential as-\nects relevant to deprivation (e.g., poverty [deprivation of vital mateial resources], reduced cognitive stimulation [cognitive deprivation]), hreat (e.g., discrimination) and unpredictability (e.g., job insecurity) Braveman et al., 2005 ; Colich et al., 2020 ; Machlin et al., 2019). Alhough individual- and/or family-focused, these measures (e.g., eduational attainment) have been shown to be strongly correlated ( r > .50) with higher level environmental SES indicators, such as neighourhood disadvantage ( Murtha et al., 2022 ), which were unavailble in the Lifespan HCP dataset. Second, social environmental unpreictability was estimated through indices of marital relationship dissoution/reconfiguration ([parental] divorce/spousal death and the exisence of step-parents, cf. Ellis et al., 2022 ), critical stressors across the ifespan ( Kendler et al., 2017 ; Oh et al., 2018 ; Richards et al., 1997 ).\nhird, in the HCP-Development sample only, we further controlled for\namily conflict, a social threat-based stressor evaluated through both outh and parent ratings, which is a substantial contributor to psychoogical well-being in early life and has been linked to functional neuodevelopmental timing in late childhood/adolescence ( Cummings and\niller-Graff, 2015 ; Harold and Sellers, 2018 ; Petrican et al., 2021 ).\nourth, likely exposure to physical violence/threat was quantified with\nlifetime inventory of traumatic brain injury.\nAccelerated biological aging pace was operationalised as earlier puertal timing (HCP-Development) or more advanced menopausal staus (HCP-Aging) than expected by chronological age. Brain maturaion/senescence was estimated with both functional and structural inices since there is compelling evidence that the two can be differenially impacted by adversity (cf. Colich et al., 2020 ) and that uncoupling f normative developmental changes in structure and function may be etrimental (cf. Baum et al., 2020).\nOur core neural marker was BOLD fMRI signal variability (BOLD SV ) ue to its putative contribution to flexible and differentiated respond-\nng to the external milieu, its role in mediating environmental efects on long-term development and psychiatric risk, as well as its suseptibility to lifespan fluctuations ( Cheng et al., 2021 ; Garrett et al.,\n021 ; Grady and Garrett, 2018 ; Millar et al., 2020b ; Nomi et al., 2017 ; heng et al., 2021 ; Wang et al., 2021 ). To capture mental state-specific ffects ( Waschke et al., 2021 ), BOLD SV was estimated during wakeful est and during performance of an externally oriented inhibitory control ask sensitive to developmental, adversity and psychopathology effects Grahek et al., 2019 ; McTeague et al., 2017 ; Thompson et al., 2021 ;\nozzi et al., 2020 ; Vink et al., 2020 ).\nBOLDsv is reportedly foundational to the development and mainenance of functionally segregated brain architecture, the linchpin of fficient and environmentally resilient processing, whose gradual emerence over the first two decades of life and subsequent decline from ate middle-age onwards is accelerated though exposure to adverity ( Baracchini et al., 2021 ; Chan et al., 2014 ; M.Y. 2018 ; Gabard-\nurnam et al., 2016 ; Garrett et al., 2021 ; Geng et al., 2021 ; Grayson & air, 2017 ; Hughes et al., 2020 ; Soldan et al., 2021 ; Tooley et al., 2021 ;\nS a ( o z N f a 2 a t s e\nt v s fl 1 2 2 c ( t fl c R c e\nl s t J\nW t s e D H 2 s a t s p a\n2\n2\nt p d t u a r H l d h t p s\nporns & Betzel, 2016 ). Relatedly, resting state BOLDsv is regarded as\nreflection of generic priors that shape future behavioral responses Pezzulo et al., 2021 ). As such, it is relevant to neurocognitive efficiency, perationalised as reduced task-resting state functional brain reorganiation for similar behavioral performance levels ( Heinzel et al., 2014 ;\neubauer and Fink, 2009 ). This capacity is linked to superior cognitive unctioning ( Schultz and Cole, 2016 ; Thiele et al., 2022 ), declines with ge (e.g., greater task-rest reorganization in older adults, Hughes et al., 020 ) and fluctuates with adversity exposure ( Liu et al., 2021 ). Thus, in ddition to BOLD SV , indices of neurocognitive efficiency (i.e., reduced ask-resting state functional flexibility) and specialization (i.e., resting tate and task-related network differentiation) were tested for their relvance to psychological resilience.\nTo estimate structural neurodevelopmental timing, we focused on wo morphological brain features, cortical thickness and gray matter olume (GMV). Both are robustly associated with BOLD SV , possibly via ynaptic pruning processes ( Faust et al., 2021 ) and vary with age as a re-\nection of both typical and pathological cognitive changes ( Giedd et al., 999 ; Lindenberger and Lovden, 2019 ; Millar et al., a , b ; Nadig et al., 021 ; Pur et al., 2019 ; Roe et al., 2021 ; Sele et al., 2021 ; Vandekar et al., 015 ). While meta-analytic evidence identifies cortical thickness as a ritical indicator of adversity-induced accelerated neurodevelopment Colich et al., 2020 ), a link between stress exposure and GMV is yet o be conclusively established. Nonetheless, across the lifespan, GMV\nuctuations track with both short-term and long-term variations in cirulating gonadal hormone levels ( Herting et al., 2014 ; Kim et al., 2018 ; ehbein et al., 2021 ). Consequently, we included GMV together with ortical thickness, reasoning that it could help explain biological aging ffects on resilience-relevant brain profiles.\nFinally, we examined whether the neural aging mechanisms underying psychological resilience would be linked to molecular markers uggestive of increased long-term vulnerability to pathologies characerized by premature brain senescence ( Cole et al., 2021 ; Dafsari and essen, 2020 ; Darrow et al., 2016 ; Fang et al., 2020 ; Han et al., 2021 ).\ne focused on Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD), a condition robustly linked o stress exposure and accelerated cellular aging via low-grade ystemic inflammation, whose onset is reportedly precipitated by arlier mood pathology ( Beurel et al., 2020 ; Cao et al., 2021 ;\nafsari and Jessen, 2020 ; Darrow et al., 2016 ; Guerrero et al., 2021 ; arerimana et al., 2022 ; Jin et al., 2021 ; Lutz et al., 2020 ; Ly et al., 021 ; Riddle et al., 2017 ). To test the relationship between the neural ubstrates of short-term resilience and molecular markers of accelerated ging pathology, we used gene expression data from the Allen Instiute of Brain Science. We thus estimated the overlap between the trancriptional signatures of our resilience-linked neural profiles and the AD olygenic risk profile derived from recent meta-analytic genome-wide ssociation study (GWAS) results ( Kunkle et al., 2019 ).\n. Method\n.1. Participants\nThe present research uses cross-sectional data preprocessed by he Lifespan HCP study team and downloaded in March 2021 as art of the 2.0 Data Release for the HCP-Development ( www.hcpevelopment.org ) and HCP-Aging ( www.hcp-aging.org ) studies. The wo samples described below reflect the largest number of biologically nrelated participants who provided good quality data on all the varibles of interest. We only included female participants because selfeport measures of biological aging were unavailable for the males in the\nCP-Aging sample. All participants were screened for a history of neuroogical, psychiatric, endocrine, genetic and other serious medical (e.g.,\niabetes, two or more seizures) disorders, use of psychotropic drugs, ead injuries with loss of consciousness and/or change in mental funcioning, and other conditions or bodily implants that may render their articipation unsafe.

HCP \u2010Development\nThis sample included 178 female participants, mostly right-handed N = 164) and aged 8 to 18 years ( M = 12.27 yrs, SD = 2.59 yrs). his age range was selected because it spans the various stages of puertal development. The racial composition of the sample was as folows: White (72.4% [youth], 80% [parent/guardian]), African Amerian (6.4% [youth] and 6% [parent/guardian]), Asian (3.2% [youth], 6% parent/guardian]), mixed race (16.9% [youth], 6% [parent/guardian]) nd unknown/unreported (1.1% [youth], 2% [parent/guardian]).\n.1.1.1. Additional exclusion criteria. Exclusion criteria specific to HCPevelopment were premature birth and/or underweight birth weight, eceiving special learning services at school and insufficient com-\nand of English to complete the study (for the youth and/guardian)\nSomerville et al., 2018 ).\n.1.2. HCP \u2010Aging\nThis sample encompassed 146 female participants, predominantly ight-handed ( N = 139) and aged 36 to 59 years ( M = 47.87 yrs, D = 7.03 yrs), an interval that captures the transition from reprouctive to late post-menopausal status. The sample was 60.3% White, 1.2% African American, 6.2% Asian, 7.5% mixed race and 4.8% unnown/unreported.\n.1.2.1. Additional exclusion criteria. Exclusion criteria unique to the CP-Aging were sensory (hearing/vision) deficits, uncontrolled high lood pressure, major organ failure, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment MoCA) score of 19 or lower ( Bookheimer et al., 2019 ).\n.2. Adversity\n.2.1. HCP \u2010Development\nThe 25-item Adverse Life Events scale from the PhenX Toolkit Stover et al., 2010) indexed participants\u2019 experience of negative events ver which they which they had little control during the year preceding he study. The scale uses a Yes / No response format to gauge event ocurrence, accompanied by a 4-point scale assessing event valence and\n6-point scale indexing event impact. Due to the low completion rate\nf the event rating scale, our analyses focused on the total number of dverse events experienced by the participants during the prior year. Of he 25 event items, we eliminated one that overlapped with our health ovariates ( \u201cGot seriously sick or injured \u201d) and three that seemed likely o evoke heterogeneous affective responses across the sample ( \u201cGot new tepmother or stepfather \u201d, \u2018Parent got a new job \u201d, \u201cGot new brother r sister \u201d). The remaining event items reflected interpersonal loss (e.g., Someone in family died \u201d), interpersonal conflict (e.g., \u201cParents argued\nore than previously \u201d), financial difficulties (e.g., \u201cMother/father fig-\nre lost job \u201d) or other life disruptions (e.g., \u201cFamily moved \u201d).\n.2.2. HCP \u2010Aging\nThe 26-item Geriatric Adverse Life Events Scales (GALES, Devanand t al., 2002 ) gauged participants\u2019 experience of acute negative episodes uring the year preceding the study. The instrument comprises a checkist of events, followed by 3-point ratings of event stressfulness and 6-\noint rating of event impact. Similar to the HCP-Development, the event ating scales had a low response rate, which is why our analyses included nly the number of adverse events. As in the HCP-Development, we liminated the two items that overlapped with health covariates ( \u201cNew\najor physical illness \u201d, \u201dOther major physical illness \u201d). We further exluded two items that diverged substantially from the life areas covered y the HCP-Development adverse events scale ( \u201cDifficulty getting adeuate professional services \u201d, \u201cBecame caretaker for a friend/relative \u201d). he remaining event items indexed life domains overlapping with those ssessed by the corresponding HCP-Development event scale, specifially, interpersonal loss (e.g., death of a close other), interpersonal conicts (e.g., divorce), financial difficulties (e.g., losing one\u2019s job) and ther life disruptions (e.g., voluntarily changing place of residence).\n.3. Biological aging\n.3.1. Pubertal timing (HCP \u2010Development)\nPubertal status was assessed with the 5-item Pubertal Developent Scale (PDS), which was selected due to its significant correlation ith other indices of pubertal development, including physician ratngs ( Petersen et al., 1988 ). The questionnaire comprises three gendereneral items (i.e., growth spurt, changes in skin, hair growth) and two ender-specific items (e.g., breast development, menarche). The instru-\nent, which uses a 4-point Likert type response format, ranging from (no development) to 4 (development already completed), was com-\nleted by the youth if aged 9 and older and by the parent about the outh for the younger participants. The scale evidenced excellent reiability in the present sample (Cronbach\u2019s alpha = 0.87). An index of ccelerated pubertal development was computed by regressing from the ggregate PDS score the youth\u2019s biological age, such that a positive resid-\nal score indicated accelerated biological aging (cf. Colich et al., 2020 ; umner et al., 2019 ).\n.3.2. Menopausal status (HCP \u2010Aging)\nResponses on the self-report survey Stages of Reproductive Aging orkshop (STRAW-10, Harlow et al., 2012) were used to estimate enopausal status, which is indexed with STRAW codes as \u201creproducive/premenopausal \u201d (4.2), \u201clate reproductive/premenopausal \u201d (4.1), early transition \u201d (3), \u201clate transition \u201d (2), \u201cearly postmenopausal \u201d coded in chronological order as 1.11, 1.12, 1.13) and \u201clate post-\nenopausal \u201d (1.14). Participants who skipped periods due to reaons other than natural menopause (STRAW codes 2.20, 1.11002/4/7,\n1 a f a 1 f v s o\nf s b t o\n2\nb i c ( p\n2\ns t c Y t C 1 c m l ( p l f\n2\nA ( t t t h p P r\n2\n2\nj p 2 D w a a\np ( ( i a a 6 i e\n2\ns w w a 0 b a 2\ni t p e o i 2\n2\nt G fi l p i\n2 t F t g ( u o 2 t p b i j ( v q f i d (\n2 f c i r\n.12002/4/7, 1.13002/4/7, 1.14002/4/7) were not included in the nalyses. Menopausal status was estimated from the numerically transormed STRAW codes, which ranged in value from 1 ( \u201creproductive ge \u201d/4.2) to 8 ( \u201clate postmenopausal \u201d/1.14). Using data available from 26 of the 146 participants in our HCP-Aging sample and controlling or whether blood was collected after fasting, we verified that more adanced menopausal status was associated with higher levels of follicle timulating hormone, Spearman\u2019s rho of 0.77, p = .001, and lower levels f estradiol, Spearman\u2019s rho of \u2212 0.58, p = .001 (cf. Harlow et al., 2012).\nBiological aging was estimated by regressing out chronological age rom the menopausal status index described above. Positive residual cores reflected accelerated, while negative scores implied decelerated, iological aging. We verified that age at menarche, a significant predicor of age at menopause, was not significantly associated with this index f biological aging, r (144) = \u2212 0.10, p = .23.\n.4. Resilience\nIn both samples, resilience was estimated by regressing out the numer of adverse life experiences from the general psychopathology risk\nndex (as described below) multiplied by \u2212 1. Positive residuals indiated greater, whereas negative residuals indicated poorer, resilience i.e., better- vs. worse-than-expected psychological functioning given ex-\nerienced adversity).\n.4.1. HCP \u2010Development: Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL)\nPsychological functioning was indexed with the parent-report verion of the CBCL ( Achenbach, 2009 ). This instrument was preferred o the Achenbach Youth Self-report Scale (YSR, Achenbach, 1991 ) beause it ensured consistency across the developmental sample (i.e., the SR is completed by participants aged 11 + years) and seemed likely o provide more reliable information for the younger adolescents. The BCL consists of 112 items scored on a 3-point Likert scale (0 = not true , = somewhat or sometimes true , 2 = very true or often true ). General psyhopathology risk was quantified by using the raw Total Problems score\nade available in the Lifespan HCP 2.0 Data Release. This strategy is in ine with Achenbach\u2019s (1991, 2013) recommendations that raw scores rather than t-scores) be used in research given their greater precision\narticularly at the extremes of the scale. In our case, this was particu-\narly appropriate since we used female-only samples and residualized or age in our analyses.\n.4.2. HCP \u2010Aging: Achenbach Adult Self \u2010Report Scale (ASR)\nParticipants\u2019 risk for psychopathology was assessed with the chenbach Adult Self-Report (ASR) instrument for ages 18\u201359\nAchenbach, 2009 ). The ASR contains a total of 123 statements relevant o psychological functioning over the previous six months and, similar o the CBCL, it requires respondents to use a 3-point rating scale (0 = not rue , 1 = somewhat or sometimes true , 2 = very true or often true ) to indicate ow well each item described them. As in the HCP-Development sam-\nle, global psychopathology risk was estimated by using the raw Total roblems score, which, similarly to CBCL, is recommended for use in esearch over the adjusted t-score (cf. Achenbach, 1991, 2013 ).\n.5. Brain development/aging\n.5.1. In \u2010Scanner task\nBoth samples completed a version of a classic Go/NoGo task, which uxtaposes free execution (Go trials) with inhibition (NoGo trials) of a\nreprotent motor response ( Bookheimer et al., 2019 ; Davidow et al., 019 ; Somerville et al., 2018 ; Winter & Sheridan, 2014 ). In the HCPevelopment, the task stimuli were associated with a history of reard/punishment, an aspect that was omitted though in the HCP-Aging nd, thus, for the sake of cross-sample comparability, also in our present nalyses.\nThe task had an event-related design and required participants to ress a button as soon as possible after seeing one of six shape stimuli Go trials), but refrain from making a response to a circle or square NoGo trials). Each shape was presented for 600 ms with a variable nter-trial interval of 1 to 4.5 s. To minimize predictability, NoGo trials re separated by 2, 3 or 4 consecutive Go trials. Go trials were marked s correct if a button press was made within the response window (i.e.,\n00 ms stimulus presentation and 200 ms into the subsequent fixation\nnterval), whereas the converse applied to NoGo trials. In both samples, ach task run contained 24 NoGo trials and 68 Go trials.\n.5.2. Data acquisition\nScanning was performed across 4 US sites on Siemens Prisma 3T canners (32-channel coil; for details, see Harms et al., 2018 ). T1-\neighted images were acquired with a multi-echo MPRAGE sequence\nith the following parameters: TR = 2500, TE = 1.8/3.6/5.4/7.2 ms, flip ngle = 8\u00b0, FOV = 256 \u00d7 240 \u00d7 166 mm, 320 \u00d7 300 matrix, 208 slices, .8 mm isotropic voxels. The fMRI data were acquired with a multiand gradient-recalled (GRE) EPI sequence (TR = 800 ms, TE = 37 ms, flip ngle = 52\u00b0, FOV = 208 mm, 104 \u00d7 90 matrix, 72 oblique axial slices, mm isotropic voxels, multiband acceleration factor of 8).\nFour rfMRI scans (eyes open with passive crosshair viewing), lastng 26 min in total, were collected from all the participants included in he present report. Two rfMRI scans were acquired with an anterior-to-\nosterior (AP) and the other two with a posterior-to-anterior (PA) phase ncoding sequence. Because HCP-Aging included only one scan per task, ur analyses of the inhibitory control data are based on the correspondng PA task run collected from each sample (4:11 min) ( Harms et al.,\n018 ).\n.5.3. Data preprocessing\nThe main processing steps applied to these data by the HCP study eam are outlined below (for further details on specific steps, see\nlasser et al., 2013 ; Robinson et al., 2018 ). Using the \u201cfmriresults01 \u201d le, available for each of the two samples as part of the 2.0 Data Re-\nease, we confirmed that the structural and functional outputs of the pre-\nrocesssing pipelines described below passed the quality control checks\nmplemented by the HCP team.\n.5.3.1. sMRI. The sMRI data were processed with the HCP Strucural Pipelines (Pre-FreeSurfer, FreeSurfer, Post-FreeSurfer). The PrereeSurfer pipeline included removal of non-brain tissue, correcions for gradient non-linearity distortions and intensity inhomoeneity, as well as intensity normalization. The FreeSurfer pipeline http://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/ ) generated the surface and volme anatomical parcellations, as well as morphometric measurements f structure volumes and surface areas (cf. Dale et al., 1999 ; Fischl et al., 001 , 2002 , 1999a ; Fischl et al., 1999b ). The Post-FreeSurfer pipeline ransformed the FreeSurfer outputs to NIFTI or GIFTI formats, aplied the transforms generated with the Pre-FreeSurfer pipeline to ring the structural images into the standard Montreal Neurologcal Institute (MNI) \u2212 152 template (0.8 mm isotropic voxels), proected the subject\u2019s native mesh surfaces into standard mesh surfaces 164k_fs_LR/32k_fs_LR) and generated surface myelin maps and ribbon olume myelin maps. The structural data thus processed were subse-\nuently precisely aligned across participants through multimodal surace mapping (MSM) registration which combines information regardng sulcal depth, myelin and functional connectivity patterns in or-\ner to optimize registration of functional cortical areas across subjects Robinson et al., 2018 ).\n.5.3.2. fMRI. The fMRI data were processed by applying the Generic MRI Volume and Surface Processing Pipelines, multi-run independent omponent analysis (ICA) FIX denoising and multimodal surface matchng registration. The Generic Volume Processing Pipeline accomplished emoval of spatial and gradient distortions, correction for participant\nm M v n w t t t n t s p w i m c t a\n2\nb\n2\na h e t D t\nw t a t t c t t i fi a n\n2\ns t o\n2\na m f r t \u201c\n2\nt\novement, bias field removal, spatial normalization to the standard\nontreal Neurological Institute (MNI) \u2212 152 template (2 mm isotropic oxels), intensity normalization to a global mean and masking out of on-brain voxels. Subsequent temporal preprocessing steps involved\neak high-pass temporal filtering with the goal of removing linear rends in the data. The Generic Surface Processing Pipeline registered he functional data into a standard grayordinate space by projecting he cortical gray matter into a registered surface mesh with a standard umber of vertices (32k_fs_LR mesh) and projecting the subcortical data o a set of subcortical gray matter voxels. A small amount of spatial moothing (2 mm full-width-at-half-maximum [FWHM]) was also aplied to the functional data at this step. The ICA FIX denoising pipeline,\nhich combines FSL\u2019s MELODIC with a more complex automated noise dentifier ( \u201cFIX \u201d), handled removal of artifacts (e.g., rigid/physiological\notion-related) which had survived the Generic fMRI Volume Preproessing step (for details, see Griffanti et al., 2014 ). Finally, similar to he structural data, the cleaned functional data were precisely aligned cross participants through MSM registration ( Robinson et al., 2018 ).\n.6. Data analysis\nOur pipeline is depicted in Fig. 2 and the main steps are described\nelow.\n.6.1. ROI definition\nOur main analyses were based on the Schaefer 300 parcel-functional tlas ( Schaefer et al., 2018 ; Yeo et al., 2011 ), downloaded from ttps://github.com/ThomasYeoLab/CBIG . The atlas version we used ncompasses 17 functional networks, spanning core systems, such as he DMN (A/B/C), Control (A/B/C), Salience/Ventral Attention (A/B),\norsal Attention (DAN A/B), Somatomotor (SM A/B), Visual (VIS Cen-\nral/Peripheral), Limbic (LB A/B), and Temporo-parietal (TP). To test\nhether age would impact intrinsic ROI functional homogeneity, we esimated the standard deviation (SD) in resting state BOLD signal across ll the component voxels within each ROI at each time point using he \u201ccifti-parcellate \u201d command with the STDEV method in the Connecome Workbench. A Mann-Whitney test provided evidence of signifiantly greater ROI functional inhomogeneity in the HCP-Aging relative o the HCP-Development (Mdns of 101.56 and 113.80, U (standardized est statistic) = 11.21, p = .0001). Consequently, to account for interndividual differences in how well the Schaefer functional brain atlas\nt the present data, our SD-based measure of functional homogeneity, veraged across all ROIs and time points, was regressed out from all the euroimaging variables of interest (see Section 2.7 below).\n.6.2. BOLD SV Based on the Schaefer atlas, ROI-level standard deviations in BOLD ignal were computed separately for the rest and for the inhibitory conrol task run ( Garrett et al., 2020 , 2010). These calculations were based n fully preprocessed functional data (as described above).\n.6.3. BOLD SV \u2010related morphological characteristics\nFSL\u2019s FAST was applied to each participant\u2019s MNI aligned T1 imges in order to obtain voxelwise gray matter volume (GMV) esti-\nates. Subsequently, GMV estimates were extracted for each of Schaeer ROIs using fslmeants. Likewise, based on the corresponding MSM egistered 32k_fs_LR .dscalar.nii files, ROI-specific cortical thickness esimates were obtained using the Schaefer .dlabel.nii atlas files and the cifti parcellate \u201d function in the Connectome Workbench.\n.6.4. BOLD SV -related functional architectural features\nTo test our hypotheses regarding the indirect contribution of BOLD SV o psychological resilience via functional network differentiation and\nfl a\n2 l a o z o h f n b e i i 2 l\n2 c S D h\nr b c a m c i\n\ud835\udc10\nw l l m\nb s i l j l\nr s t t t 2 t s p m d p e a o t\nt i t\nr S f e o R a m d s w s\n2\n2\nS t w \u201c o r a f a r D e m o p r y\n2\ni a r n e s s o y\n(\n(\n(\nexibility across multiple mental states, we conducted the connectivity nalyses detailed below.\n.6.4.1. ROI \u2010to \u2010ROI correlations in timeseries. Pairwise Pearson\u2019s corre-\nations between all the Schaefer ROIs were computed separately for task nd rest in Matlab and expressed as Fisher\u2019s z-transformed scores. Previus research has documented differences in the brain\u2019s modular organiation (i.e., number of identified communities) based on the time scale n which connectivity has been assessed ( Bassett et al., 2011 ). To avoid\naving time scale act as a potential confound when comparing task-rest unctional brain organization, we opted to characterize resting state conectivity on the same time scale as task-related connectivity, thereby reaking the 1912-volumes resting state data into six blocks of 290 vol ach (the additional volumes from the beginning and end of the restng state scan were dropped from the analyses). In line with prior studes using multilayer community detection algorithms (e.g., Finc et al.,\n020 ), only the positive Fisher\u2019s z-scores were entered in the network-\nevel analyses detailed below, while negative z-scores were set to zero.\n.6.4.2. Network \u2010level analyses. All the network-level metrics were omputed using the Brain Connectivity Toolbox (BCT, Rubinov & porns, 2010) and the Network Community Toolbox (NCT, Bassett, .S. [2017, November]. Network Community Toolbox. Retrieved from ttp://commdetect.weebly.com/ ), as described below.\n2.6.4.2.1. Functional community structure: multilayer louvain \u2010like algoithm. To characterize patterns of ROI-based functional reorganization etween rest and task, we used a multilayer generalised Louvain-like ommunity detection algorithm, first introduced by Mucha et al. (2010) nd implemented in the NCT. This algorithm partitions a network with\nultiple layers into non-overlapping groups of nodes (i.e., functional ommunities) with the goal of maximizing an objective modularity qualty function, defined as\n= 1 2 \ud835\udf07 \u2211 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5f [( \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc59 \u2212 \ud835\udefe\ud835\udc59 \ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc59 ) \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5f + \ud835\udeff\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udf14 \ud835\udc57\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5f ] \ud835\udeff ( \ud835\udc54 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc59 , \ud835\udc54 \ud835\udc57\ud835\udc5f )\nhere 2 \ud835\udf07 is the sum of all connection weights in the network across all ayers, w ijl represents the connection strength between nodes i and j in ayer l; \ud835\udefe l is a resolution parameter determining the size of the identified\nodules in layer l; e ijl is the connection strength expected by chance\netween nodes i and j in layer l, and defined as e ijl = s il s jl \ud835\udc63 with s il and jl being the sum of all connection weights of node i and j, respectively, n layer l, while v is the sum of all connection weights in the network in ayer l; \ud835\udf14 jlr is the connection strength between node j in layer l and node\nin layer r, and g il and g jr give the community assignments of node i in\nayer l and node j in layer r.\nIn the above modularity quality optimization, there are two free paameters, the spatial resolution parameter, \ud835\udefe, which tunes community ize within each layer, and the cross-layer connection strength parameer, \ud835\udf14 , which determines community stability across layers. In our study, he two network layers were defined by the rest and the inhibitory conrol task, respectively. Dovetailing with the prior literature ( Finc et al., 020 ; Mattar et al., 2015), the spatial resolution parameter was set to he default value of 1. In line with other studies of heterogenous mental tates ( Finc et al., 2020 ), the cross-layer (task-rest) connection strength arameter was set to 0.5. To account for the near degeneracy of the\nodularity landscape (Good et al., 2010), the multilayer community\netection algorithm was initiated 100 times for each of the six task-rest airs (as described above, the rest scan was broken down into six blocks qual in duration to the task block). All the functional network interctions indices detailed below were averaged across the 600 iterations f the modularity optimization function (6 task-rest pairs x 100 iteraions/pair).\n2.6.4.2.2. Functional network interactions. Our analyses focused on wo ROI-level functional interaction diagnostics, which were computed n the NCT across the 600 iterations of the multilayer community deection algorithm: (1) functional flexibility/task-resting state functional\neorganization, operationalised as the number of times each ROI in the chaefer atlas changed communities between task and rest, and (2) diferentiation/segregation (called \u201crecruitment \u201d in the NCT), which was stimated separately for task vs rest, and operationalised as the number f times a given ROI was assigned to the same community as the other\nOIs in its native functional system, as defined in the Schaefer functional tlas. To facilitate mapping of the relevant results onto the conceptual\nodel presented in Fig. 1 , indices of functional network differentiation\nuring task and rest were multiplied by \u2212 1 in the HCP-Aging sample, o that higher scores would reflect greater dedifferentiation consistent\nith greater functional brain aging. This was done post-analysis for pre-\nentational purposes only.\n.7. Confounding variables\n.7.1. Family conflict\nThe 9-item Family Conflict subscale of the Moos Family Environment cale (Moos and Moos, 1994) gauged exposure to domestic violence in he HCP-Development sample. Each item is scored as 1 or 0 for true / false ,\nith reverse coding of items that imply lack of conflict in the home (e.g.,\nWe fight a lot in our family. \u201d versus \u201cFamily members rarely become penly angry. \u201d). Higher scores indicate a more conflictual family envionment. Both parent and youth versions demonstrated acceptable relibility (Cronbach\u2019s alphas of 0.67 and 0.61). Two parents and one youth ailed to answer one item on the scale. Consequently, for both caregiver nd youth versions, all the reported analyses used the sum scores proated by number of missing items, as available in the Lifespan HCP 2.0\nata Release. Consistent with the interpretation that youth and parent valuations may capture distinguishable aspects of the family environ-\nent, the two scores were only moderately correlated, Spearman\u2019s rho\nf 0.28, p = .0001. We opted to control not only for youth, but also arental measures of conflict because the latter could capture indirect outes through which interpersonal conflict which did not involve the outh may have still impacted their psychological functioning.\n.7.2. Residualization\nRecent literature suggests that residualization of both variable sets ntroduced in multivariate analyses such as PLS or canonical correlation nalyses , which use permutation-based significance testing, may bias esults ( Winkler et al., 2020 ). Consequently, we only residualized the\non-imaging variables entered in the PLS analyses (i.e., recently experinced adversity, biological aging, resilience). All residualization analyes were conducted separately in the HCP-Aging and HCP-Development amples. The following confounders were thus regressed out from each f the three non-imaging variables using multiple linear regression analsis:\n1) participants\u2019 chronological age in order to estimate acceler-\nated/decelerated development/aging and recent adversity exposure independent of age (within each group), 2) SES indicators: (a) race (represented through four dummy coded\nvariables \u201cAfrican American \u201d, \u201cAsian \u201d, \u201cMultiracial \u201d, \u201cNot Reported \u201d) which also accounted for racial differences in genetic architecture and risk loci ( Abdellaoui and Verweij, 2021 ; Nievergelt et al., 2019 ; Wojcik et al., 2019 ) potentially relevant to adversity exposure and psychological resilience; (b) income-to-needs (i.e., family income divided by number of dependants, see Table 1 ); (c) educational attainment (of the primary caregiver in HCP-Development [to ensure consistency across participants given variability in parental marital status and availability of educational information for the second biological parent/primary caregiver\u2019s current partner] and of the participant in HCP-Aging, coded as a continuous variable, see Table 1 ), 3) history of social environmental unpredictability predating the prior\nyear: sum of parental divorce and having a step-parent (maximum possible value of \u201c2 \u2033 , HCP-Development) or number of divorces and/or times one has been widowed (HCP-Aging);\n(\n(\n(\n( (\n(\n(1 (1\n2 g o i w u m o ( l a r c b\n2\n2\nl a t a n f a l b\n2 s b i\nw o h s e A t s a\n2 s t r fi g t s l\n2 y t p t a t a c c t ( s\np M t c g b s e\na t a m b s b 2 a s m r t s b p a w c f p t a\n4) chronic social threat: family conflict (HCP-Development only, youth\nand parent ratings),\n5) history of likely exposure to physical threat/violence: (HCP-\nAging only) lifetime history of head trauma (cf. Saikumar and Bonini, 2021 ) based on the total score from the Boston Assessment of Traumatic Brain Injury-Lifetime Questionnaire ( Fortier et al., 2014 ; the sole HCP-Development participant relevant to our objectives with head trauma followed by loss of consciousness was eliminated from analyses), 6) physical health outcomes potentially also linked to prior adversity\nexposure and which could have impacted the neuroimaging measures (all scores available in the 2.0 Data Release): (a) BMI (coded as a continuous variable), (b) regular medication use (dummy coded as Yes/No),\n7) handedness (continuous) score, 8) scanner site (three dummy variables [i.e., \u201cHarvard \u201d[HCP-\nD evelopment ]/ \u201dMassachusetts General Hospital \u201d[HCP-Aging] coded \u201c1 \u2033 for participants tested at Harvard/ Massachusetts General Hospital and \u201c0 \u2033 otherwise, \u201cMinnesota\" coded \u201c1 \u2033 for participants tested at the University of Minnesota and \u201c0 \u2033 otherwise, \u201cUCLA\" coded \u201c1 \u2033 for participants tested at UCLA and \u201c0 \u2033 otherwise; Washington University in St. Louis was the baseline against which the other three sites were compared) to account for broad demographic and individual scanner-related differences among sites), 9) participant-specific average SD in resting state BOLD signal across all\nvoxels within each ROI at each time point as a participant-specific index of \u201cbrain fit \u201d with the Schaefer functional atlas,\n0) average scan-specific motion per participant ( Power et al., 2015 ), 1) overall accuracy on the SST operationalised as sum of misses on the\nGo trials and false alarms on the No-Go trials in order to capture individual differences in how the participants managed the task demands irrespective of their behavioral performance.\n.7.2.1. Data reduction: multivariate normality. The multiple linear reression analyses used for confounder residualization are sensitive to vilations of multivariate normality ( Hair et al., 2014 ), which we observed n our original data. To address this issue, a square-root transformation\nas applied to the Total Problems scores in both samples prior to residalization for confounders. In the HCP-Development sample, issues of\nultivariate non-normality further required elimination of a univariate\nutlier on recent adversity ( z -score > 4) and elimination of multivariate Mahalanobis distance-based, p < .001) outliers prior to residualization, eaving a final sample of 168 participants. Following these steps, an exmination of the adversity, resilience and accelerated biological aging esiduals using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (with the Lilliefors signifiance correction) confirmed that multivariate non-normality issues had\neen solved in both samples (all p s > 0.05).\n.8. Brain \u2010behavior \u2010gene analyses\n.8.1. Partial least squares analysis (PLS)\nTo identify brain patterns linked to adversity, resilience and bioogical aging, as well as characterize the relationship between brain nd gene expression profiles, we used partial least squares correlaion often referred to as PLS (Krishnan et al., 2011), a multivarite technique that can identify in an unconstrained, data-driven man-\ner, neural patterns (i.e., latent variables or LVs) related to diferent conditions (i.e., task PLS) and/or individual differences varibles (behavioral PLS). PLS was implemented using a series of Matab scripts, which are available for download at https://www.rotman-\naycrest.on.ca/index.php?section = 345 .\n.8.1.1. Brain differences related to adversity, biological aging and reilience: behavioral PLS 1. To identify yoked differences in profiles of rain morphology and function, which are linked to adversity, biologcal aging and resilience, we conducted one behavioral PLS analysis in\nhich each data type was modelled as a separate condition. Number f adverse events, accelerated biological aging, resilience \u2014all of which ad been residualised for confounders as described above and, thus, preented themselves as approximate continuous Gaussian variables \u2014were ntered as the behavioral variables. The HCP-Development and HCP-\nging participants were entered as two separate groups. By entering\nhe two groups in the same analysis we were able to probe age grouppecific vs age group-independent brain correlates of adversity, accelerted biological aging, and resilience.\n.8.1.2. Gene expression \u2010brain profile associations indicative of risk vs reilience: behavioral PLS 2. A behavioral PLS analysis probed the link beween gene expression profiles and patterns of brain structure/function elevant to adversity and resilience. The latter was the brain LV identi-\ned in behavioral PLS analysis 1. The former was expressed as an ROI x ene expression level matrix and derived with the abagen toolbox from he comprehensive transcriptomic maps provided by the Allen Brain Intitute (see section \u201cGene Expression Data Processing and Analysis \u201d beow).\n.8.1.3. Significance and reliability testing. In all the reported PLS analses, the significance of each LV was determined using a permutation est (5000 permutations for the brain-[behavior] analyses and 100,000 ermutations for all the analyses involving gene expression data). In he permutation test, the rows of the ROI or of the gene expression data re randomly reordered (Krishnan et al., 2011). In all PLS analyses, poential axis rotations (i.e., changes in the order of the extracted LVs) nd reflections (i.e.,changes in the sign of the saliences), which may ocur during resampling with either permutations or bootstrapping, were orrected with a Procrustes rotation, which defines a transformation hrough which the resampled singular value decomposition outcome i.e., the identified LVs) is rotated to match most closely the original ingular value decomposition outcome ( Milan and Whittaker, 1995 ).\nIn the gene-brain PLS analysis, to account for correlated gene exression patterns based on anatomical proximity ( Fornito et al., 2019 ;\narkello & Misic, 2021) we used Vasa\u2019s \u201crotate_parcellation \u201d funcion in Matlab ( https://github.com/frantisekvasa/rotate_parcellation/ ommit/bb8b0ef10980f162793cc180cef371e83655c505 ) in order to enerate 100,000 spatially constrained permutations of the Schaefer rain LV, as identified in behavioral PLS analysis 1. These spatially contrained permuted brain LVs were used to assess the significance of the xtracted gene LVs.\nIn the case of our present analyses, PLS assigned to each ROI or gene weight, which reflected the contribution of the respective ROI or gene o a specific LV. The reliability of each ROI\u2019s or gene\u2019s contribution to\nparticular LV was tested by submitting all weights to a bootstrap estiation (1000 bootstraps for the brain-[behavior] analyses and 100,000 ootstraps for all the analyses involving gene expression data) of the tandard errors (SEs, Efron, 1981 ) (the bootstrap samples were obtained y sampling with replacement from the participants, Krishnan et al., 011). In order to increase the stability of the reported results, we used\nnumber of permutations/bootstraps several orders greater than the tandard ones (i.e., 500 permutations/100 bootstrap samples), as recom-\nended by McIntosh and Lobaugh (2004) for use in PLS analyses of neuoimaging data. The higher number of permutations/bootstraps used for he gene expression data was determined by the relatively lower result tability compared to the brain-(behavior) only analyses, as suggested y preliminary successive iterations of the gene PLS analysis using 5000 ermutations/1000 bootstraps. A bootstrap ratio (BSR) (weight/SE) of t least 3 in absolute value (approximate associated p -value of .0027)\nas used as a threshold for identifying those ROIs that made a signifi-\nant contribution to the identified LVs. For the gene PLS analyses, we ocused on approximately the top 20% of absolute value BSRs (i.e., aproximately top 10% at either tail of the distribution), which amounted o a BSR at least 5 (approximate associated p -value < 10 \u2212 5 ). The BSR is nalogous to a z-score, so an absolute value greater than 2 is thought to\nm f u\n2\nt u a m t s e K m C i B a d y o P P t\n2\nd\n2 w 5\nS b s m t o c R t ( a b i p a p c s\ne T s w a\np (\n\ud835\udc65\nw o p\n\ud835\udc65\nake a reliable contribution to the LV (Krishnan et al., 2011), although or neuroimaging data BSR absolute values greater than 3 tend to be sed (McIntosh & Lobaugh, 2004).\n.8.2. Mediation analyses\nTo test potential mechanisms through which neurodevelopmental iming may mediate the impact of adversity on psychopathology, we sed Hayes\u2019 PROCESS 3.5 macro for SPSS ( Hayes, 2018 ). PROCESS is n ordinary least squares (OLS) and logistic regression path analysis\nodeling tool, based on observable variables. Mediation models were ested employing 95% confidence intervals with 50,000 bootstrapping amples. In line with extant guidelines on balancing Type I and Type II rrors in mediation analyses ( Hayes and Scharkow, 2013 ; Tofighi and\nelley, 2020 ), the confidence intervals for indirect effects was estiated using percentile bootstrap, which is the default option in PROESS 3.5. As recommended by Hayes and Cai (2007) , a heterodastic-\nty consistent standard error and covariance matrix estimator was used.\nootstrapping-based 95% confidence intervals for the indirect effects, s outputted by PROCESS, were used as effect size estimates. In the meiational analyses, number of adverse events experienced in the prior ear constituted the predictor variable, whereas global psychopatholgy (i.e., raw Total Problems score) representated the main outcome. rofiles of accelerated/decelerated brain development/aging, linked by LS to adversity and/or psychological resilience, were tested as potenial mediators.\n.8.3. Gene expression data processing and analysis\nFig. 3 depicts the pipeline for the transcriptomic and polygenic risk\nata analyses. The main steps are described below.\n.8.3.1. Microarray gene expression. Micro-array gene expression data ere obtained from six postmortem brains (1 female, ages 24.0\u2013 7.0, 42.50 + /- 13.38) provided by the Allen Institute for Brain\ncience ( https://www.brain-map.org/ ). Because only two of the six rains contained data from the right hemisphere and gene expresion patterns are largely symmetric across the two hemispheres, our\nain analyses were based on gene expression patterns mirrored across he two hemispheres. However, we also verified that the results of ur gene enrichment AD-related gene expression analyses are repliated when only using gene-brain data from the left hemisphere\nOIs (cf. Ball et al., 2020 ; Hansen et al., 2021 ; see Supplemen-\nary Materials). The gene expression data was processed with abagen https://github.com/netneurolab/abagen ). Microarray probes were rennotated based on the probe-to-gene mapping information provided y Arnatkevi \u010di \u016b t \u0117 et al. (2019) and filtered based on their expression ntensity relative to background noise ( Quackenbush, 2002 ), such that robes with intensity less than the background in > = 50% of samples cross donors were discarded. When multiple probes indexed the ex-\nression of the same gene, we selected and used the probe with the most onsistent pattern of regional variation across donors (i.e., differential tability; Hawrylycz et al., 2015 ).\nThe MNI coordinates of tissue samples were updated to those genrated via non-linear registration using the Advanced Normalization ools (ANTs; https://github.com/chrisfilo/alleninf ). Samples were asigned to brain regions in the Schaefer atlas if their MNI coordinates\nere within 2 mm of a given parcel. All tissue samples not assigned to brain region in the provided atlas were discarded.\nInter-subject variation was addressed by normalizing tissue samle expression values across genes using a robust sigmoid function Fulcher et al., 2013 ): norm = 1\u2215 ( 1 + exp ( \u2212 ( \ud835\udc65 \u2212 \u27e8\ud835\udc65 \u27e9) \u2215 IQ R \ud835\udc65 ))\nhere \u27e8x \u27e9 is the median and IQR x is the normalized interquartile range f the expression of a single tissue sample across genes. Normalized exression values were then rescaled to the unit interval: \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc51 = ( \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5a \u2212 min ( \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5a )) \u2215 ( max ( \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5a ) \u2212 min ( \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5a ))\nu w w a t ( S\n2 t r t t g f G t r w r t\n2 l p g o 1 m S ( e p f 3\nw s g a o r A B r a l t n o B L L l b A t\n2\nd h t l\na h B b t S w b a t 5\n3\n3 a\n2\n3 r\na C p e t a s h m S S\n3 i v\na F l o S a i r l r r r S\n3 p\ns f t a t s b i\nGene expression values were then normalized across tissue samples sing an identical procedure. Samples assigned to the same brain region ere averaged separately for each donor and then across donors. After e eliminated the ROIs without reliable gene expression (based on the bagen parameters outlined above), the resulting gene expression marix, used in all our analyses, was in the format 297 (ROIs) x 15,632 genes). A list of ROIs lacking reliable gene expression is included in the upplemental Materials (Table S1).\n.8.3.2. Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis. To identify the funcional gene categories that underpin the link between the resilienceelevant brain and the gene expression profiles, we used the software oolbox created by Fulcher et al. (2021) . This toolbox has been shown o adequately control for within gene ontology (GO) category geneene co-expression patterns, thereby mitigating the potential for inflated alse positive rates which can affect traditional inference methods of\nO enrichment. Enrichment analyses were conducted using 40,000 cus-\nom null ensembles, obtained by using Vasa\u2019s algorithm to rotate the esilience-linked brain LVs from behavioral PLS analysis 1. Analyses\nere conducted on GO categories comprising 5 to 200 genes. Below we eport the corrected p -values obtained by fitting a Gaussian distribution o the estimated null distribution.\n.8.3.3. AD overlap tests. To probe the link between short-term psycho-\nogical resilience and longer-term risk for accelerated cognitive aging\nathologies, we examined the overlap between our resilience-relevant ene expression LV and AD risk genes identified in prior meta-analyses f genome-wide brain association studies (GWAS, minpGWAS of at least 0 \u2212 7 , Kunkle et al., 2019 ). The AD-relevant candidate risk loci had been\napped onto the corresponding genes by the original authors using the\nNP2GENE tool in FUMA and made available via the Public Results tab https://fuma.ctglab.nl/browse , Watanabe et al., 2017 ). Based on their QTL analysis output, we identified 77 AD-linked genes reliably exressed in our data. Of these, the risk allele(s) reduced gene expression or 44 of them ( AD_low ), but increased gene expression for the remaining 3 ( AD_high ).\n2.8.3.3.1. Resilience \u2010relevant gene LV. Our AD risk overlap tests ere conducted on genes with an absolute value BSR of at least 5 (asociated p -value < 10 \u2212 5 ). Comparisons were conducted separately for enes with positive versus negative loadings on the gene LV. As an exmple, for the positive BSR genes, the procedure was as follows: (1) we btained separate counts of the number of AD_low and AD_high genes, espectively, with a BSR of at least 5 on our gene LV ( AD_low_pos and\nD_high_pos , respectively); (2) we counted the number of genes with a SR of at least 5 on our gene LV ( Orig_pos ); (3) from each of the coresponding gene LVs in the null distribution (each of which had been ligned with the original gene LVs via a Procrustes transform), we seected a number of genes equal to Orig_pos ( Null_pos ); (4) we counted he number of null samples (out of the total of 100,000) in which the\number of either AD_low_pos or AD_high_pos in Null_Pos exceeded the one bserved in Orig_pos . The same procedure was followed for the negative SR genes. The estimation of the AD risk associated with a given brain V depended on the sign of the correlation between the gene and brain V. For instance, if the identified gene LV were to be positively correated with the brain LV of interest, then the associated AD risk would\ne estimated as a conjunction of AD_low genes with negative BSRs and D_high genes with positive BSRs observed in the original data relative o the null distribution.\n.9. Replication of results\nAll the results reported below were replicated using bi-hemispheric ata from the Gordon atlas ( Gordon et al., 2016 ), as well as leftemisphere-only data from the Schaefer and Gordon atlases, respecively (for results of these analyses, see Supplemental Materials). The eft-hemisphere only analyses were solely relevant to the brain-gene\nnalyses and were conducted to verify the robustness of our biemispheric results, because only two of the six donors from the Allen rain Institute had right hemisphere transcriptomic data. Furthermore, ecause operationalization of racial ancestry can be difficult and its inerpretation open to some debate (e.g., whether it reflects genetic vs ES-related effects), we further replicated all the results in analyses in\nhich we did not control for racial background. In the Results below, ased on the Schaefer atlas, we only discuss the results replicated across ll the control analyses outlined above and included in the Supplemenal Materials. These results are presented in red rectangles in Figs. 4 and .\n. Results\n.1. Brain profiles linked to adversity and resilience: behavioral PLS nalysis 1\nThis analysis identified two LVs (both p s = 0.0002), accounting for 5.20% (LV1) and 12.14% (LV2) of the brain-behavior covariance.\n.1.1. LV1: accelerated functional brain development/aging correlates with ecent exposure to adversity in adolescence and middle age\nLV1 reflected primarily brain patterns linked to adversity exposure nd was most robustly expressed in ROIs from the DMN, SAL-VAN, ontrol, DAN, SM and VIS (see Fig. 4 -a and Table S2). In both samles, this LV reflected the positive association between recent adversity xposure and accelerated functional brain development (i.e., increased ask-related network differentiation, HCP-Developmment, Fig. 4 -b) or ging (i.e., reduced BOLD SV during both task and rest, HCP-Aging, ee Fig. 4 -c). Furthermore, in both adolescence and middle adultood, the adversity-linked profile of earlier functional brain develop-\nent/senescence was also associated with accelerated biological aging.\nupplemental analyses replicating these results are presented in Figures 1, S3, and S5.\n.1.2. LV2: opposing patterns of functional brain development/aging\nnvolving SM, control, dmn and sal \u2010van predict resilience in adolescence ersus middle adulthoodhood\nLV2 differentiated developmental/aging patterns observed in DMN nd SAL-VAN ROIs from those detected in SM and Control ROIs (see ig. 5 -a, b and Table S3). In the HCP-Development sample, this LV inked greater resilience, recently experienced adversity and faster bilogical aging to accelerated SM and Control, but delayed DMN and AL-VAN, functional development, as indicated by patterns of BOLD SV nd functional network differentiation (see Fig. 5 -c). Complementarily, n the HCP-Aging sample, LV2 associated higher levels of resilience, ecently experienced adversity and slower biological aging with deayed SM/Control, but accelerated DMN/SAL-VAN functional aging, as eflected in patterns of functional network dedifferentiation and taskesting state topological flexibility (see Fig. 5 -d). These results were eplicated in the corresponding supplemental analyses (see Figures S2, 4, and S6).\n.2. Functional brain mechanisms protecting against adversity \u2010linked sychopathology: mediation analyses\nBased on our proposed neural sequence related to psychological reilience ( Fig. 1 -c), we next tested the role of BOLD SV and of its putative unctional network correlates (task-rest flexibility, task/rest differentiaion) in partially accounting for the shared variance between adversity nd psychopathology. No structural brain variables were included in hese analyses since none evidenced robust relationships with either reilience or adversity in the PLS analyses. Based on the PLS-identified rain LVs linked to adversity exposure and resilience (and replicated n the supplemental analyses), our mediation analyses focused on LV2\n( D e fl L t fi w w l (\n3\np o w\n3\nt v T a g w w S\n3\n3\ne w T C C t a p D\n3\nH D v h S d r\n3 H\nr fi a\ntask-related BOLD SV , functional differentiation during task) in the HCP-\nevelopment sample. In the HCP-Aging sample, we examined mediation ffects of task and resting state BOLD sv (PLS LV1, Fig. 4 -c) via functional exibility and task-related network differentiation (LV2, Fig. 5 -d). The V1 flexibility and dedifferentiation scores score were not included in he analyses because their associations with adversity were more dif-\ncult to accommodate within the model depicted in Fig. 1 -c and they ere not replicated across all supplemental analyses. Biological aging as not included in any of the mediation analyses due to its weak corre-\nations with adversity and psychological resilience/risk in both samples r s from 0.09 to 0.10).\n.2.1. HCP \u2010Development\nThe results did not support our hypothesis that BOLD SV would exlain the shared variance between adversity exposure and psychopatholgy risk through its functional network correlates (i.e., task-related netork differentiation) (see Fig. 6 -a and Table 2 ).\n.2.2. HCP \u2010Aging\nWe only found evidence of resting state BOLD SV mediation effects via ask-rest functional network flexibility (see Fig. 6 -c and Table 2 ), but not ia task-related functional network dedifferentiation (see Fig. 6 -b and\nable 2 ). The results presented in Fig. 6 -c thus imply that widespread dversity-related reductions in resting state BOLD SV are associated with reater SM/Control, but reduced DMN/SAL-VAN functional flexibility,\nhich are, in turn, linked to higher psychopathology risk. These results ere replicated in the corresponding supplemental analyses (see Figure\n7 and Table S10).\n.3. Gene expression profiles linked to adversity, resilience and AD risk\n.3.1. Gene expression profile linked to adversity exposure and resilience\nA behavioral PLS analysis, based on the abagen-outputted ROI x gene xpression matrix, identified a sole gene expression profile ( p = 10 \u2212 5), hich accounted for 83.81% in the brain-gene expression covariance. his gene LV was linked positively to the resilience, r = 0.30, 95% I = [.24; 0.39] but negatively to the adversity-relevant, r = \u2212 0.40, 95% I = [ \u2212 0.50; \u2212 0.32] brain LV (see Fig. 7 -b). Given the relationship beween the resilience-associated brain patterns in the HCP-Development nd HCP-Aging samples (see Fig. 5 -c, d), the identified gene LV was ositively linked to the HCP-Aging, but negatively linked to the HCP-\nevelopmental neural senescence/maturation patterns.\n.3.2. GO enrichment patterns\nThe enrichment analysis ( Fulcher et al., 2021 ) suggested that the CP-Aging resilience brain profile was positively, whereas the HCPevelopment was negatively, linked to greater expression of genes inolved in positive regulation, as well as modulation, of postsynaptic inibitory potential (both corrected p -values of 0.012, see Fig. 7 -a; see upplemental Materials for replication of these effects with the Goron atlas). No significant associations were detected for the adversityelevant brain LV.\n.3.3. Relevance of the AD risk genes to the HCP \u2010Development vs CP \u2010Aging resilience brain\nGiven the positive correlation between the gene and the HCP-Aging esilient brain LV, resilience-linked AD risk in the HCP-Aging was dened based on the number of the AD_low genes with negative BSRs nd AD_high genes with positive BSRs. Complementarily, based on the\nn b f g a ( a (\n4\ns p ( 2\nc a h w h D 2 i i l a l a s g egative correlation between the gene and HCP-Development resilient rain LV, resilience-linked AD risk in the HCP-Development was derived rom the number of the AD_high genes with negative BSRs and AD_low enes with positive BSRs. There was no evidence of a significant assocition between the HCP-Development resilient brain profile and AD risk permutation-based p = .28). We found though support for a significant ssociation between the HCP-Aging resilient brain profile and AD risk permutation-based p = .0002) (see Fig. 7 -c). . Discussion The substantial long-term damage inflicted by life adversities preumably stems, at least partly, from psychological mechanisms suporting initial adaptation, such as accelerated neurobiological aging Belsky, 2019 ; Callaghan and Tottenham, 2016 ; McLaughlin et al., 014, 2016 ). Using lifespan HCP data, our study replicates the asso-\niation between recent adversity exposure and accelerated biological nd functional brain development/aging. The latter is most salient in igher-order association systems (i.e., DMN, SAL-VAN, DAN, Control)\nhich are known for their protracted developmental trajectories and enanced lifespan vulnerability to psychiatric disorders ( Cai et al., 2021 ; wyer et al., 2014 ; Ho et al., 2021 ; Kaiser et al., 2015 ; Sydnor et al., 021 ). More importantly, our investigation extends this literature by\ndentifying age-specific patterns of apparent acceleration/deceleration n brain development/senescence linked to resilience and earlier (adoescence) versus delayed (middle-age) biological aging. Suggestive of\npartially antagonistic relationship between short-term resilience and onger term psychological adjustment ( Colich et al., 2020 ), the neural ging correlates of middle-aged resilience were associated with trancriptomic markers of vulnerability to accelerated brain aging patholoies, specifically, AD.\n4\ns G t T S c u B t o w c i p r g b z j l w a c\nD H s t f s s\nm o t e b f o b l a\n4\na v o p ( 2 o t d i 2 a c r i m h\nv T\nt a t M c o t a l P n o l p p e t l\n4\nr ( p s t p t l v 2\nt S v B D p t w c A l c p a t m S S\nw e t d\n4\nw p\n.1. Psychological resilience and brain development/aging\nParalleling previous proposals that the timing of adversity shapes its equelae ( Aschbacher et al., 2021 ; Gee and Casey, 2015 ; Nelson and\nabard-Durnam, 2020 ), we unveiled complementary neural signa-\nures of psychological resilience in adolescence versus middle age.\nhese profiles reflected the divergent developmental/aging patterns of M/Control versus DMN/SAL-VAN ROIs (see Fig. 5 -c, d). In adolesence, greater resilience was linked to relatively faster functional matration of SM/Control systems, as reflected by patterns of task-related OLD SV and network differentiation (see Fig. 5 -c). Complementarily, he HCP-Aging resilience profile reflected the divergent relationship f brain-wide resting state BOLD SV decrements, related to adversity,\nith sensory and control versus attentional and internally oriented pro-\nessing system differentiation and flexibility (see Fig. 6 -c). As such, t mainly captured the antithetic segregation and functional efficiency\natterns of SM/Control versus DMN/SAL-VAN which are predictive of educed psychopathology (i.e., the link between higher resilience and reater DMN/ SAL-VAN dedifferentiation and task-rest reorganization, ut greater SM/Control differentiation and reduced task-rest reorganiation, see Fig. 5 -d). Whether these findings reflect divergent aging traectories underpinning resilience and/or indicate the chronically high evels of cognitive effort engaged by individuals who successfully cope\nith adversity is a question for future research (see Finc et al., 2020 for link between reduced DMN segregation/differentiation and greater\nognitive effort).\nOf note, the joint contributions of SM, SAL-VAN and the core MN subsystem, reportedly subserving self-related processes ( Andrewsanna et al., 2007 ), to resilience concur with recent proposals linking\nelf-regulatory success to (internal) self-in-(external) context represenations ( Koban et al., 2021 ). The involvement of SM and SAL-VAN is urther consonant with their putative function as transdiagnostic hubs, ince sensory and attentional deficits constitute key psychopathology ymptoms ( Kebets et al., 2019 ; McTeague et al., 2017 ).\nIt is worth pointing out that extant evidence suggests that coupled aturational changes in structure and function, particularly in higher-\nrder association systems subserving cognitive control-relevant funcion, are cornerstone to successful development in adolescence (cf. Baum t al., 2020). However, in our study, greater psychological resilience in oth adolescence and middle adulthood was associated only with diferences in functional maturation/aging timing. This raises the question f whether structure-function developmental/aging uncoupling could e one of the mechanisms underpinning the partially antagonistic reationship between short-term resilience and long-term psychological djustment.\n.2. Neurogenetic substrates of the resilience \u2010AD vulnerability overlap\nExtending prior investigations on the interplay between genetic nd neural architecture in shaping evolutionary and lifespan deelopmental processes, our present study testifies to the relevance f a yoked connectomics-transcriptomics approach to characterizing otential mechanisms underpinning vulnerability to brain disorders Arnatkevi \u010di \u016b t \u0117 et al., 2021 ; Changeux et al., 2021 ; Fornito et al., 2015 , 019). Specifically, complementing prior findings on the contribution f negative affectivity and mood pathology to AD onset, we report that he brain senescence patterns predictive of short-term resilience in midle adulthood are associated with a gene expression profile implicated n AD risk ( Cole et al., 2021 ; Dafsari and Jessen, 2020 ; De Jager et al.,\n021 ; Kunkle et al., 2019 ). The transcriptomic signature of the brain ging profile positively associated with the adult, but negatively assoiated with the adolescent, resilient brain LV (see Fig. 5 -c, d) was eniched for genes implicated in synaptic inhibition. These results are thus n line with the putative role of altered GABA-ergic inhibition in the\nood- and AD-linked cognitive deficits, as well as the relevance of in-\nibitory/excitatory balance to adolescent neural plasticity and neurode-\nelopmental disorders ( Larsen and Luna, 2018 ; Prevot and Sibille, 2021 ; ang et al., 2021 ; Zacharopoulos et al., 2021 ).\nOur neurogenetic results are thus compatible with the interpretaion that immediate adaptation mechanisms linked to neurobiological ging may unleash a cascade of cellular processes that heighten longerm psychiatric and neurodegenerative risk ( Dafsari and Jessen, 2020 ;\ncLaughlin et al., 2014, 2016). This proposal echoes prior reports that ellular changes precede by decades the clinical phase of AD, thereby pening a window of opportunity for earlier identification and intervenions targeting at-risk individuals ( De Strooper and Karran, 2016 ). An lternative interpretation warranting further study is that our resilienceinked neurogenetic results reflect a case of antagonistic pleiotropy (cf.\nrovenzano and Deleidi, 2021 ). Specifically, individuals who are geetically predisposed towards accelerated brain aging and later develpment of AD (e.g., Gonneaud et al., 2021 ) may show greater psychoogical resilience earlier in life, potentially through a less differentiated\nrocessing of the external milieu. The viability of this proposal is worth robing in future studies targeting interactions between genetically and nvironmentally (i.e., acute and chronic adversity) triggered acceleraion in neurobiological aging, as well as their role in predicting psychoogical resilience across multiple timescales.\n.3. Brain profiles linked to the timing of biological aging\nOur investigation focused on two key hormonal transition stages, eflecting female reproductive maturation and senescence, respectively Laube et al., 2020 ; Rehbein et al., 2021 ). Our decision was based on rior evidence on the role of ovarian hormones in psychological reilience, an effect likely explained through their GABA-ergic and oxyocin mediated downregulation of HPA axis activity following stress exosure ( Engel et al., 2019 ; Joffe et al., 2020 ; S\u00fcss et al., 2021 ). Moreover, he susceptibility of ovarian hormones to adverse life events renders it ikely that they could (partly) explain stress modulation of brain deelopment/aging trajectories ( Eck and Bangasser, 2020 ; Gordon et al.,\n018 ).\nOur analyses revealed complementary patterns of association beween accelerated biological and brain aging in the two age groups. pecifically, in line with prior evidence on the immediately adaptive alue of precocious neurobiological aging in adolescence ( Belsky, 2019 ;\nrieant et al., 2021 ; Callaghan and Tottenham, 2016 ), in the HCPevelopment sample, we detected a positive association between earlier ubertal timing and the accelerated functional neurodevelopment patern predictive of resilience. Conversely, accelerated biological aging\nas robustly inversely linked to the resilience functional brain senes-\nence profile characterised during the inhibitory control task in HCPging (i.e., overlapping neural substrates of greater resilience and deayed biological aging). This finding suggests that in later life quick reovery and/or active resistance to stressors may depend (in part) on\nreservation of sex hormone-mediated (down)regulation of HPA axis ctivity and dampened reactivity to the external milieu, potentially due o the accelerated aging of functional networks underpinning environ-\nental vigilance (i.e., SAL-VAN [cf., Fig. 5 -b, S2-b), CON [cf. Figure\n4-b,6-b), Dosenbach et al., 2007 ; Sadaghiani and D\u2019Esposito, 2015 ; eeley et al., 2007 ; Sridharan et al., 2008 ).\nIn neither sample was biological aging timing robustly associated ith the number of recent negative experiences. This implies that accel-\nrated maturation/senescence may be solely related to chronic, rather han acute, forms of adversity ( Tooley et al., 2021 ) and/or only certain imensions of adversity (i.e., exposure to violence, Colich et al., 2020 ).\n.4. Limitations and future directions\nOur present findings could be extended in several ways. First, multiave longitudinal data could be used to account for heterogenous reroductive and neural developmental trajectories through growth curve\na s a c p p r c u t s i 2 r e a p C a s B T s r n m t S a p S a t q s e S s n M i t g i a 2 t o w t p 2 S s w m t\n4\na a e A m\nd b\nD\ns u A\nC\nl\nC\nC\ns M J\nA\nf h h D b U t f P\nU C v N V o\nS\nt\nR\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nA\nnalysis methods ( Becht and Mills, 2020 ). Second, recent studies undercore the protective role of the brain\u2019s functional architecture against dversity-linked cardiometabolic risks ( Miller et al., 2018 ). While we ontrolled for cardiometabolic functioning as a means of accounting for rior adversity exposure, its potential link to brain and biological aging atterns underpinning shorter- versus longer-term resilience would warant further study. Third, the impact of adversity on biological aging in hildhood/adolescence varies with genetic susceptibility to earlier matration ( Sun et al., 2020 ), an effect that may be worth probing across he life course. Fourth, future investigations combining hormonal meaures with self, parental (for adolescents) or physician indices of biologcal aging (i.e., pubertal timing/menopausal status, e.g., Herting et al.,\n021 ) could determine the mechanisms through which psychological esilience, as demonstrated immediately after exposure to stressful life vents, may dampen or accentuate longer-term vulnerability to psychitric and/or neurodegenerative disorders. Fifth, direct lifespan comarisons of chronic versus acute exposure to adversity (cf. Gee and asey, 2015 ) may elucidate their distinguishable effects on reproductive nd brain system-specific maturation/senescence, thereby helping peronalize interventions for vulnerable individuals ( Brieant et al., 2021 ; urstein et al., 2021 ; Goldstein et al., 2021 ; Herzberg et al., 2021 ; yborowska et al., 2018 ). While a dimensional approach to adversity, imilar to the one we used to estimate longer-term stress exposure, is curently thought to better capture the individual variability in long-term eurodevelopmental outcomes (e.g., Ellis et al., 2022 ), indices of cu-\nulative stress exposure should nonetheless be included to provide furher insight into the determinants of resilience (e.g., Seery et al., 2010 , eery et al., 2013 ). These measures would ideally be collected within\nprospective longitudinal design, since retrospective assessments are\nrone to recall biases (for a meta-analysis, see Baldwin et al., 2019 ). uch in-depth phenotyping may be difficult to implement in studies s large as the Lifespan HCPs. However, this provides a useful illusration of how the exploratory work that is afforded by large highuality multimodal databases can be developed in more depth through maller studies carrying targeted phenotyping on a question of interst. Sixth, use of cellular senescence measures (e.g., DNA methylation, chumacher et al., 2021 ) would enable inclusion of gender diverse amples and more in-depth exploration of resilience-relevant neurogeetic mechanisms, including potential sex differences (for a review, see\ncEwen et al., 2015 ). For instance, cellular aging indices would allow nquiries into how pre-/perinatal stressors (e.g., malnutrition, maternal raumatic experiences/inflammation) can interact with the offspring\u2019s enetic profile to shape their lifespan development, including biologcal aging rate and, thus, potentially their resilience against later life dversity ( Chan et al., 2019 ; Goldstein et al., 2021 ; Krontira et al.,\n020 ; Mareckova et al., 2020 ; Ramo-Fernandez et al., 2021 ). Seventh, here is compelling evidence that personal characteristics, such as sense f purpose, sprituality, and social-affective enrichment in the form of\narm parenting in childhood/adolescence and supportive close relaionships later in life can alleviate the sequelae of prior adversity exosure ( Bowes et al., 2010 ; Feder et al., 2009 ; Gee, 2021 ; Gunnar et al., 019 ; Kiecolt-Glaser et al., 2020 ; Luby et al., 2020 ; Manvelian and barra, 2020 ; Sbarra and Coan, 2018 ; Toumbelekis et al., 2021 ). As uch, more in-depth investigation of the unique mechanisms through\nhich distinct intra- and interpersonal factors may protect against the align effects of stressful life experiences would be worth pursuing in\nhe future.\n.5. Conclusions\nIn sum, we documented the distinguishable patterns of accelerted/decelerated neurodevelopment linked to resilience in adolescence nd middle adulthood, as well as the potential psychological benefit of arlier reproductive maturation, but delayed reproductive senescence. dditionally, we provided suggestive evidence that the neural aging\nechanisms underpinning short-term psychological resilience in mid-\nle adulthood could be linked to increased long-term risk for accelerated rain senescence pathologies, such as AD.\nata statement\nThe raw data are available at https://nda.nih.gov/ccf/lifespantudies upon completion of the relevant data use agreements.
