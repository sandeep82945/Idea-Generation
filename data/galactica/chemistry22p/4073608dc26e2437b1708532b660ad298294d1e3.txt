Recent technological innovations in the field of mass spectrometry have supported the use of metabolomics analysis for precision medicine. This growth has been allowed also by the application of algorithms to data analysis, including multivariate and machine learning methods, which are fundamental to managing large number of variables and samples. In the present review, we reported and discussed the application of artificial intelligence (AI) strategies for metabolomics data analysis. Particularly, we focused on widely used non-linear machine learning classifiers, such as ANN, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM) algorithms. A discussion of recent studies and research focused on disease classification, biomarker identification and early diagnosis is presented. Challenges in the implementation of metabolomicsâ€“AI systems, limitations thereof and recent tools were also discussed. 1. conclusions Artificial intelligence is a widely used approach in metabolomics and other highthroughput technologies, especially for performing early diagnosis. Recent studies have established several strategies for disease classification based on metabolomics profiles, demonstrating the potency of machine learning in the medical science field. Nonetheless, there are considerable drawbacks to overcome yet, including the interpretation of machine learning models and the development of robust models to account for disease and population heterogeneity. In fact, to date, with a given, specific dataset there is no gold standard for the selection of the optimal algorithm to be used. In fact, minimum changes in the dataset structure may result in significantly diverse outcomes as a function of the chosen algorithm.
