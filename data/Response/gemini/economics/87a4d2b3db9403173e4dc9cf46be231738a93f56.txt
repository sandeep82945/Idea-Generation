1. **Investigate the impact of using different standard populations for age-adjusting health expenditure on health system efficiency scores.** The current study used the OECD subset population as the standard population for age-adjusting health expenditure. However, other standard populations could be used, such as the GBD standard population or the World Health Organization (WHO) standard population. It would be interesting to compare the results of using different standard populations to see if they have a significant impact on health system efficiency scores.
2. **Examine the relationship between health system efficiency and other environmental determinants of health expenditure, such as health status and longevity.** The current study only considered age structure as the sole environmental determinant of health expenditure. However, other factors, such as health status and longevity, can also affect health expenditure. It would be interesting to investigate the relationship between health system efficiency and these other environmental determinants to see if they have a significant impact on efficiency scores.
3. **Develop a more comprehensive method for age-adjusting health expenditure that takes into account multiple environmental determinants.** The current study proposed a simple method for age-adjusting health expenditure that uses a single standard population. However, a more comprehensive method could be developed that takes into account multiple environmental determinants. Such a method could be used to produce more accurate and reliable age-adjusted health expenditure estimates.
4. **Apply the proposed age-adjustment method to a different dataset or context.** The current study applied the proposed age-adjustment method to a dataset of 188 countries in 2015. It would be interesting to apply the method to a different dataset or context, such as a dataset of US states or a dataset of countries over a longer time period. This would help to assess the generalizability of the method and its applicability to different settings.
5. **Investigate the impact of age-adjusting health expenditure on the results of health system efficiency analyses.** The current study found that age-adjusting health expenditure can have a significant impact on health system efficiency scores. It would be interesting to investigate the impact of age-adjusting health expenditure on the results of health system efficiency analyses. For example, it would be interesting to see if age-adjusting health expenditure changes the ranking of countries in terms of efficiency or if it changes the conclusions of the analysis.
