    "abstractText": "Pentalenene is a ternary cyclic sesquiterpene formed via the ionization and cyclization of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP), which is catalyzed by pentalenene synthase (PentS). To better understand the cyclization reactions, it is necessary to identify more key sites and elucidate their roles in terms of catalytic activity and product specificity control. Previous studies primarily relied on the crystal structure of PentS to analyze and verify critical active sites in the active cavity, while this study started with the function of PentS and screened a novel key site through random mutagenesis. In this study, we constructed a pentalenene synthetic pathway in E. coli BL21(DE3) and generated PentS variants with random mutations to construct a mutant library. A mutant, PentS-13, with a varied product diversity, was obtained through shake-flask fermentation and product identification. After sequencing and the functional verification of the mutation sites, it was found that T182A, located in the G2 helix, was responsible for the phenotype of PentS-13. The site-saturation mutagenesis of T182 demonstrated that mutations at this site not only affected the solubility and activity of the enzyme but also affected the specificity of the product. The other products were generated through different routes and via different carbocation intermediates, indicating that the 182 active site is crucial for PentS to stabilize and guide the regioselectivity of carbocations. Molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations suggested that these mutations may induce changes in the shape and volume of the active cavity and disturb hydrophobic/polar interactions that were sufficient to reposition reactive intermediates for alternative reaction pathways. This article provides rational explanations for these findings, which may generally allow for the protein engineering of other terpene synthases to improve their catalytic efficiency or modify their specificities.",

            "text": "Sesquiterpenes are natural terpenoids with 15 carbon atoms, which are derived from the assembly of three isoprene units [1]. They represent the largest subgroup of terpenoids in terms of the number and type of structural skeleton. Some sesquiterpenes have fragrant odors and a diversity of biological activities, including antioxidant, anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, and anti-microbial activities, and have been widely used in food, feed, daily chemical, pharmaceutical, energy, and other fields, exhibiting great economic value and broad market prospects [1]. Pentalenene is an angular triquinane (containing three fused five-membered rings) sesquiterpene produced by a variety of Streptomyces species, which are solid-welling saprophytic bacterium and antibiotic producers [2\u20134]. Based on\nBioengineering 2023, 10, 392. https://doi.org/10.3390/bioengineering10030392 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/bioengineering\nBioengineering 2023, 10, 392 2 of 15\ncalculation, the hydrogenated product of pentalenene was found to have comparable combustion energy to the commercial jet fuel A-1, and it can thus be used as a jet fuel blending agent [5]. Pentalenene is the precursor of antibiotic pentalenolactone, which exerts its antimicrobial activity by the selective irreversible inhibition of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [6,7]. Pentalenene is synthesized by pentalenene synthase (PentS), which is a classic sesquiterpene synthase that has attracted sustained research interest. PentS was first isolated and characterized from Streptomyces sp. UC5319 in 1987 [8]. The analysis of its crystal structure revealed that the enzyme was a 38 kDa monomer consisting of 11 \u03b1 helices (designated A to K) [9,10]. Helix B, C, G, H, and K formed an active cavity approximately 15 \u00c5 deep and 9 \u00c5 wide [10]. PentS belongs to the class I terpenoid cyclases and contains conserved Asp-rich (DD\u00d7\u00d7D) and NSE/DTE motifs for binding of the diphosphate moiety of the substrate along with three Mg2+ ions [11]. Site-directed mutagenesis was performed to understand the structure\u2013function relationship of PentS, including the mutation of the conserved domain, and the replacement of aromatic and basic amino acid residues in the active cavity. For example, replacing the aspartic acid of the aspartate-rich domain with glutamate resulted in decreased catalytic efficiency (kcat/Km) and the formation of varying proportions of germacrene A, which were the results of greater steric and conformational freedom in the binding cavity of the carbonium ion intermediates [11]. When the aromatic residue F76 in the active cavity was mutated to tryptophan or histidine, the activity decreased by 68% and 92%, respectively. The F76W mutant produced a small amount of another anti-Markovnikov addition product, \u03b1-humulene, in addition to pentalenene, indicating that the benzene ring and pyrrole ring of tryptophan may stabilize the carbonium ion at C9 and C10. The F76H mutant generated trace \u03b1-humulene and a significant amount of Markovnikov addition product germacrene A, which was due to the resculpting of the active site such that a different conformation of farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) was stabilized in the binding cavity [12]. In addition, the only obvious basic residue in the active cavity is H309, which appears to be the ideal site for the deprotonation of carbocation intermediates to produce pentalenene. Unexpectedly, H309A, H309S, H309C, and H309F mutants retained substantial cyclase activity, with relatively minor changes in kcat/Km for all but the H309F mutant, which was presumably caused by relaxed control over the substrate FPP and the carbocationic intermediate conformations in the active sites of the various H309 mutants [13]. These findings clarify the relationships between the structure and function of conserved motifs and provide information for elucidating the catalytic mechanism of PentS. However, the PentS variant with enhanced activity was not obtained. This study aimed to engineer PentS synthase from Streptomyces sp. PSKA01 through the combination of random mutagenesis and saturation mutagenesis to explore novel key active sites and elucidate their structure\u2013function relationships. Firstly, we constructed a pentalenene synthetic pathway and a mutant library harboring PentS variants generated by error-prone PCR. Next, shake-flask fermentation and product identification were carried out to isolate mutants with increased activity or varied product diversity. Then, sequencing and mutation site verification were performed to find which mutation was responsible for the phenotype of the desired mutant. The target residue was subjected to site-saturation mutagenesis and the product diversity of the mutants was analyzed. Finally, the mechanism by which a single active site affected both the activity and specificity of PentS was elaborated in detail through molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This study enriched our knowledge of the structure\u2013function relationship of terpenoid cyclase and provided useful information for engineering other terpene synthases toward enhanced activity and improved specificity."

The crystal structure of PenA (PDB: 6wkd) [12], which shares 92.9% of its sequence identity with PentS, was selected as a modeling template for the 3D structural analysis of PentS. A > 10 ns position-restrained MD simulation was performed to eliminate the steric conflicts of the modeled protein. The molecular docking process was performed by Autodock 4.2 to predict the binding models of PentS with FPP [20]. Before docking, the ligand FPP was sketched using ChemDraw 2014 and imported into the molecular operating environment (MOE) software to conduct the 3D protonation and energy minimization. Then, the chemical structure of FPP was saved in the PDB format. The docking protocol began with a rigid-body docking in which the binding pocket was strictly positioned a 10 \u00c5 distance away from the ligand FPP. Metal ions of Mg2+ and residues forming the binding pocket were both considered in the grid-docking box. Pose clustering was employed and a maximum number of 100 conformations were considered; finally, the docking pose with the lowest binding free energy was selected as the PentS\u2013FPP complex."

The GAFF and AMBER99SB force field parameters for the ligand and protein were parameterized. The periodic boundary conditions were implemented, and each amino was assigned as the standard ionization state at a pH = 7.0 physiological condition. Na+ ions were added by using the Monte Carlo ionplacing method to neutralize the whole protein\u2013ligand system. Subsequently, the constant 1000 kJ/mol force restrained MD simulations for all heavy atoms of protein and the pyrophosphate head group were conducted. The FPP carbon chain was freely optimized with no force restrained within simulations. Initial geometry optimizations of each system were conducted using 5000 iterations (5 ps) with the steepest descent algorithm. Two-staged equilibration steps conditioned for 100,000 iterations (100 ps) under constant NVT (number of particles, volume, and temperature) and constant NPT (number of particles, pressure, and temperature) ensembles were proceeded to minimize the system. The root mean square deviation (RMSD) of all heavy atoms for each single mutant was verified until the MD simulations reached an equilibrium state. The binding model between each PentS and FPP was extracted for detailed analysis. The binding free energies of the protein\u2013ligand complex were calculated using the MMPBSA module, and the average structure was extracted for conformational analysis. The average coordinate of heavy atoms from residues forming the binding pocket was defined as the geometry center."

PSKA01, a pentalenene synthetic pathway was constructed in E. coli BL21(DE3) (Figure S1). The shake-flask fermentation of the strain was performed and the product was analyzed by GC or GC\u2013MS. The results show that pentalenene was the major product, accounting for more than 98% of the total product (Figure 1A). The titer of pentalenene was up to 2.13 g/L, which was much higher than the reported highest pentalenene production in the engineered E. coli strain, namely 780.3 mg/L (Table 2) [5]. To explore the new active site and further understand the structure\u2013function relationship of PentS, we introduced random mutation to PentS by error-prone PCR. After screening up to 341 colonies, a mutant PentS-13 was found to have a varied product diversity. While pentalenene (1) was still the major product, other products such as sativene (2), longifolene-V4 (3), \u03b2-chamigrene (4), thujopsene-I3 (5), and \u03b2-elemene (6) were increased at different degrees (Figure 1A,B and Figure S2). Among them, 2, 3, and 4 were new sesquiterpenes that were not found in the products of strains harboring the wild-type PentS. The sequencing results indicate that the mutant had four mutations, Y150H, T182A, F196I, and Q209R, located in the F helix, G2 helix, random coil at the junction of G2 helix and H helix, and H helix, respectively (Figure 1C). To determine which mutation contributed to the changed product diversity, we created single-site mutants of Y150H, T182A, F196I, and Q209R by site-directed mutagenesis, respectively. Compared with the wild type, the pentalenene production of T182A, F192I, and Q209R decreased by 50.9%, 15.1%, and 10.6%, respectively, whereas the pentalenene production of the Y150H mutant did not change significantly (Figure 1D). The T182A single mutant displayed a very similar product profile and titer to the PentS-13 mutant (Figure 1A).

Possible cyclization pathways for wildtype PentS and mutants to generate various sesquiterpenes from FPP are illustrated in Figure 3. The cyclization pathways have been extensively studied using a variety of stereospecifically labeled forms of FPP [12,27,28]. Products of wild-type PentS and variants were mainly generated through three pathways as follows: (1) 1 and 3 were generated through anti-Markovnikov pathways.

Overall, the above results are consistent with the relative activity analysis (Figure 2), especially the DO-C values, which are negatively correlated with the pentalenene production of the last four variants.\nVVdW (\u00c53): volume size of each residue; Polarity: polarity of each mutated residue (P: polar; H: hydrophobic; C+: electronic positive charged); VCavity (\u00c53): volume size of the binding cavity; \u2206G (Kcal/mol): binding free energy for each variant and ligand; DO-C (\u00c5): distance between the geometric center of the binding cavity and the O4 atom of the head group P2O74\u2212.\nTo further understand the role of the 182nd residue and elucidate the structure\u2013activity relationship of PentS, wild-type PentS together with the 10 variants were conducted for detailed analysis of the binding pattern variations. As shown in Figure 5A, for the wild-type PentS\u2013FPP complex, one close geometric matching identified that the hydrophobic carbon chain tail of FPP curled itself inside the bottom of the binding pocket with a DO-C of 4.6 \u00c5. A structural change in the 182nd position can trigger significant changes in binding models between variants and FPP, and can induce variation in the catalytic activity. Among the 10 variants, T182A, T182C, T182S, and T182V maintain similar conformations with the most approximate DO-C compared with the wild-type PentS\u2013FPP complex (Figure 5B\u2013E). These mutations caused gentle changes in the binding pockets and small fluctuations in the binding free energies, which resulted in changed catalytic activities to varying degrees. When T182 mutated to I182, the extended side-chain prompted a sharp decrease in the ligand binding space and tended to squeeze the polar head of FPP out of the pocket (see Figure 5F), which enlarged the DO-C and attenuated the binding ability of the T182I mutant. Therefore, the pyrophosphate anion group could not maintain the bidentate manner to the Mg2+ ions and led to the almost complete loss of catalytic activity. More extreme interference occurred in variants harboring charged residues, as the charged residues (K182 and R182) completely destroyed the original physicochemical characteristics in the wild-type PentS\u2013FPP complex. As shown in Figure S6C,E, the positively charged residues (K182 and R182) enhanced the repulsion to the hydrophobic tail of FPP and resulted in increased binding free energies of \u22128.37 kcal/mol and \u22126.53 kcal/mol, respectively. Besides the physicochemical properties, the geometric characteristics also play critical roles in maintaining the catalytic activity of PentS. As shown in Figure S6B,D,F, residues with large side-chains (W182, F182, and M182) reduced the volume of the cavity and compelled the pyrophosphate head of FPP out of the binding region. The maximum difference of the DO-C was observed in mutant T182F. FPP could not fold itself properly in the binding cavity of these five variant systems, resulting in significantly increased binding free energies of \u22128.31~\u22126.53 kcal/mol (Table 3) and a complete loss of catalytic activity. The above results suggest that altering the volume size or the polarity of the binding pocket had evident effects on the catalytic function of terpenoid synthase.\nBioengineering 2023, 10, 392 11 of 15Bioengineering 2023, 10, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 15\nWhen T182 mutated to I182, the extended side-chain prompted a sharp decrease in the ligand binding space and tended to squeeze the polar head of FPP out of the pocket (see Figure 5F), which enlarged the DO-C and attenuated the binding ability of the T182I mutant.

The previous studies on the active sites of the pentalenene synthase mainly focused on the conserved motifs, aromatic residues, and charged residues, and most mutants exhibited decreased catalytic activities [11\u201313]. In this study, we found a novel active site of PentS, the T182 residue, through random mutagenesis and mutant screening. Site-saturation mutagenesis at this position revealed that this active site could not only affect the protein solubility but also the product yield and specificity. For example, the substitution of Thr with Ser led to increased production of both the total sesquiterpenes and pentalenene. This mutant was the only variant with higher pentalenene synthase activity compared with the wild type; hence, it provided a clue for engineering other terpene synthases toward enhanced activity and laid the foundation for the commercial production of high-value terpenes. Substitutions of T182 with Ala, Cys, or Val retained substantial cyclase activity. However, these mutations resulted in a decreased production of pentalenene and an increased production of other sesquiterpenes at different degrees. The other sesquiterpenes were generated through different routes and via different carbocation intermediates. These results suggest that the 182 active site is crucial for PentS to stabilize and guide the regioselectivity of carbocations, and that non-aromatic residues, including polar residues, made substantial contributions during the reactions, which contradicts previous opinions according to which the polar residues are not well-suited for stabilizing carbocations [39]. T182 is located in the G helix. The G helix has been reported to play important roles in protecting the substrate carbocation from exposure to the outer environment, and it is involved in regioselectivity and product specificity of terpene synt ases. Single or multiple mut tions of the k y active sites in the G helix of terpene synthases could change the selectivity of products or affect the catalytic activity [38,40\u201342]. For example, the random mutagenesis and rational design of the G helix of the (+)-\u03b4-cadinene synthase resulted in the N304P/L405H mutant, which maintained the cyclase activity and changed its product from\nBioengineering 2023, 10, 392 12 of 15\n(+)-\u03b4-cadinene to germacrene D-4-ol [38]. The investigation of TPS4 and TPS5 from Zea mays found that the stereoselectivities of the two terpene synthases could be significantly affected by residue 409 located in a highly conserved kink of the G helix. The change from Gly 409 to Ala resulted in a variant that produced mostly (S)-\u03b2-bisabolene with only minor amounts of the bicyclic compounds, sesquithujene and sesquisabinene, which may be due to the fact that the additional methyl group altered the shape of the cavity wall or changed the distance between the F helix and G helix and thus changed the relative rate of the formation of different carbocation intermediates [43]. Srivastava et al. found that mutations in the G helix kink region of germacradien-11-ol synthase resulted in a drastic change in the product profile, with G188A in particular leading to the formation of the complex non-hydroxylated isolepidozene as the major product, which proved that the residue 188 played a key role in the rearrangement of the G helix in active site closure and substrate ionization [41]. Shukal et al. engineered fungal viridiflorol synthase through phylogeny-based mutation combined with random mutagenesis and found that the G-helix-located E267S could enhance the viridiflorol-specific yield of the V314Y-G227C-E267S triple mutant, whereas the E267S single mutant exhibited a significantly reduced viridiflorol yield [42]. The T182 residue presented in this study is not located at a similar position as the above active sites, indicating that it is a novel key active site that has never been characterized before. T182 is located at the lower part of the G2 helix, which is near the bottom of the binding pocket. T182 mutations affected the conformation and hydrophobic/polar properties of the G2 helix. The significantly changed product profiles of T182 mutations further supported that the G helix is an important catalytic feature of terpene synthases that has a profound effect on product specificity. Molecular docking and MD simulations were employed in elaborating the detailed binding properties and binding models of the wild type and variants of PentS. The calculated binding properties provide useful information for understanding the PentS\u2013FPP complex; the DO-C has a particularly good negative correlation with the catalytic activities, which suggests that these methods are reliable in analyzing the structure of enzyme without crystallization trials. It was revealed that residue at the 182 position could affect both the product yield and specificity by altering the shape and volume of the active cavity and subtly changing the hydrophobic/polar interactions between the variants and FPP. The change in the conformation and properties of the active cavity led to the corresponding change in the conformation of FPP, which resulted in varied binding affinities and catalytic activities [41]. The conformation change in FPP probably influenced the possibility and frequency of other carbon atoms attacking the C1 cation intermediate after FPP ionization and increased the generation of different carbocation intermediates, which contributed to the various product profiles. These results support the opinion that the degree of conformational flexibility of the substrate in the active site of a terpene synthase is a major determinant of product selectivity [44] and proved that the 182 active site is crucial for the catalytic activity and regioselectivity of PentS."

Through random mutant library construction and screening, a mutant PentS-13 with decreased pentalenene production and increased production of other sesquiterpenes was obtained. Site-directed mutagenesis and functional analysis proved that T182A mutation was responsible for the changed product yield and profile. The site-saturation mutagenesis of T182 demonstrated that residue 182 affected the protein solubility and played important roles in maintaining enzyme activity and product specificity. Molecular modeling helped to illustrate the PentS\u2013FPP complexes and reveal that mutations at the 182 position may induce changes in the cavity shape and volume and disturb hydrophobic/polar interactions sufficiently to reposition reactive intermediates for alternative reaction pathways.
