Trauma-related symptoms such as motor restlessness, emotional instability, and concentration problems can mimic, trigger, or exacerbate ADHD symptoms. Moreover, given the relationship between ADHD and trauma-induced distress, it has been suggested that dissociative experiences and attention problems may reveal overlapping characteristics. The aim of this study was to investigate the associations between dissociative experiences and attention deficits by carrying out mixture analysis. A thousand and thirty-seven participants volunteered to the online investigation. Participants completed a test battery that included a sociodemographic form as well as the Adult ADHD Severity Rating Scale (ASRS), Wender Utah Rating Scale (WURS), Childhood Trauma Questionnaire (CTQ), Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES), and Somatoform Dissociation Questionnaire (SDQ). Item responses on the DES and attention deficit symptoms as indexed by the ASRS were subjected to latent class analysis. The three-latent-class model outperformed alternative mixture models. Mixture analysis classified the sample into three homogenous subgroups as follows: (1) No/low dissociation or attention problems; (2) Moderate dissociation with attention problems; and (3) High dissociation with attention problems. High dissociators with attention problems were characterized by heightened scores on somatoform dissociation and emotional neglect. No/low dissociation or attention problems latent class reported significantly lower scores on hyperactivity/impulsivity, depression, attention deficit in childhood, and sexual abuse than both moderate and high dissociation latent classes. High dissociators and moderate dissociators significantly differed on conduct problems and physical abuse. We concluded that impulsive hyperactivity, depression, and childhood sexual abuse were common features in heightened dissociation latent classes, as well as attention deficit.",

Although ADHD symptoms tend to decrease in adulthood, a significant proportion of adults with ADHD remain symptomatic, which negatively affects their academic performance, educational achievement, interpersonal relationships, and social functioning (Faraone et al., 2006). ADHD is a predisposing factor for many psychiatric disorders in adulthood, including mood, anxiety, personality, substance-related, trauma-related, and dissociative disorders (Adler et al., 2004; Fragkaki et al., 2019).\nThe emerging evidence points out significant associations between ADHD and childhood traumatic experiences. In a more recent systematic review of associations of ADHD with maltreatment in childhood, Craig, Bondi, O\u2019Donnell, Pepler, and Weiss (2020) identified that early exposure to severe traumatic experiences appear to be exerting significant influence on the formation of ADHD symptoms later in the development. Some of the ADHD symptoms might be associated with maltreatment that is an integral part of posttraumatic stress disorder (Famularo et al., 1992). Several persistent symptoms of inflated arousal in trauma-related disorders overlap with ADHD symptoms clusters, including sleeplessness, hypervigilance, motor restlessness, emotional instability, and difficulty in concentration. Moreover, it is thought that children with ADHD are more likely to have experienced traumatic events (Dahmen et al., 2012; Ford et al., 2000; Ruiz, 2014; Szymanski et al., 2011; Weinstein et al., 2000).\nDissociation is the disruption and/or discontinuity of one or more of the mental functions that are normally work synchronously, such as memory, identity, consciousness, emotion regulation, environment, and body perception. Moreover, as a prevailing notion, dissociation serves as a buffering mechanism in response to adverse life events to protect the ego from the negative consequences of traumainduced cognitions and emotions that can affect body perception/representation (somatoform dissociation) and mental functions (psychoform dissociation) (\u015ear, 2008). Studies using neuropsychological tests and fMRI have documented that, in comparison to individuals with normal levels of dissociation, individuals with pathological dissociation were more prone to reveal deficiency in execution function, particularly attentional control difficulties and failures in response inhibition (Fani et al., 2019; Giesbrecht et al., 2004; Schurle Bruce et al., 2007). Additionally, a more recent study indicated that somatoform dissociation scores were significantly higher among the high-risk ADHD group than were in the low-risk group when participants were divided into two groups based on the Adult ADHD Severity\nRating Scale (ASRS) cutoff score (Kande\u011fer & Tekdemir, 2020).\nEpidemiological studies conducted in Turkey reported dissociative disorders are common in the general population and have been reported above 10% in psychiatric outpatients and inpatients (Aky\u00fcz et al., 1999; \u015ear et al., 2007). A study conducted in the province of Istanbul found that the prevalence of dissociative disorders was 35.7%, which was the highest rate in the literature in psychiatric emergency admissions (Sar et al., 2003). Studies conducted in Turkey have revealed robust correlations between ADHD and dissociative symptoms that the authors suggested that ADHD/ dissociative symptoms may predispose or exacerbate other psychopathologies (Kande\u011fer et al., 2022; \u00d6zdemir et al., 2015).\nSignificant associations between ADHD and pathological dissociation have consistently emerged in in the literature (Bozkurt et al., 2015; Fragkaki et al., 2019; Sar et al., 2014). In a clinical investigation conducted by Endo et al. (2006), one-thirds of children with ADHD who reported abuse had a comorbid dissociative disorder. Matsumoto and Imamura (2007) identified that childhood ADHD symptoms persisting into adulthood revealed significant associations with adult dissociative symptomatology. Harrison and Wilson (2005) identified greater levels of overlaps between dissociative experiences and attention deficit symptoms based on the similarities in symptom patterns of these two clinical phenomena such as difficulty sustaining attention, concentration problems/distractibility, forgetfulness, and failure to follow instructions in tasks in a study, investigating linkages within ADHD and early traumatic experiences. Evidence is compelling that these two clinical entities may have overlapping features. Moreover, the phenomenon of \u2018hyperfocus\u2019, which is characterized by intense and difficult-to-shift attention and diminished awareness of time and environment (like a hypnotic spell) has recently been associated with ADHD (Hupfeld et al., 2019; Ozel-Kizil et al., 2016; Groen et al., 2020) comparatively addressed the overlapping features of hyperfocus experiences with ADHD in community and clinical samples and reported that frequency of hyperfocus experiences were positively tied to ADHD symptoms among healthy individuals. In contrast, frequency, duration and pervasiveness of hyperfocus states did not significantly differ between ADHD patients and matched healthy controls. This mental state seems to be very similar to the \u201chighway hypnosis\u201d, in which it is subsequently noticed that awareness is losing during any activity in dissociative experiences (Dell, 2017). Additionally, alterations in consciousness such as mind wandering and maladaptive daydreaming have been reported to be associated with both dissociation and ADHD (Bozhilova et al., 2018; Marcusson-Clavertz et al., 2012; Ross et al., 2020; Somer et al., 2017). Chui and\n1 3\n28882\nCurrent Psychology (2023) 42:28881\u201328894\ncolleagues have demonstrated the switching function of dissociative experiences that individuals with a high tendency to dissociate reveal an enhanced ability to divert attention to a new mental set under negative emotional load (Chiu et al., 2009, 2016). Therefore, fluctuations across hyperfocus experiences and mental dissociative states may operate sequentially in cognitive functioning in cases of ADHD. Finally, functional brain connectivity analyses studies have revealed altered brain connectivity, especially in the default mode network in both dissociation and ADHD (McKinnon et al., 2016; Rubia, 2018).\nAs emphasized above, the evidence emerged in the research is that dissociative experiences are significantly associated with symptom clusters of the ADHD, particularly attention deficit symptoms. Even though, early traumatic experiences are consistently identified as a substantial vulnerability factor in the etiology of dissociative symptomatology, the connections between these two clinical entities of dissociation and attention problems in relation to childhood traumatic experiences, somatization, affective problems are still yet to be elaborated. Thus, we speculated several hypotheses as follows: (i) heterogeneity of the community sample would exist in the mixture analysis concerned with the associations among dissociation and attention deficits, (ii) considering the symptom patterns subjected to the mixture analysis, dissociative experiences would be tied to attention deficit symptoms, and (iii) individuals allocated in various homogenous subgroups would differ in affect regulation and behavioral problems."

The validity and reliability of the Turkish form have been demonstrated in two different studies (Dogan et al., 2009; Evren et al., 2016). Using factor analytic strategy in 579 university students, Dogan et al. (2009) showed that nine items (items 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11) tapped into the Attention Deficit subscale, and the remained nine items (items 5, 6, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 18) tapped into the Hyperactivity subscale. Additionally, the Turkish version of ASRS had highlevel internal consistency (Cronbach alpha: 0.88). Higher scores indicate higher ADHD symptoms. It is suggested that the cut-off score should be determined as 30, and this cutoff score is reported to correspond to sensitivity = 0.75, specificity = 0.79, Kappa = 0.44, positive predictive value = 0.46, and negative predictive value = 0.93 (Evren et al., 2016).\n1 3\n28883\nCurrent Psychology (2023) 42:28881\u201328894\nand positive symptoms (localized pain, taste change, and odor preferences/reluctance) can be scored in the range of 20\u2013100 (Nijenhuis et al., 1996).

Then, mixture analysis was conducted to uncover the optimal latent profiles. The latent profile algorithm of the mixture analysis is used to obtain optimal number of latent classes. Mixture analysis resembles factor analytic procedures that observed variables are grouped into subsets of variables accurately representing the observed covariance matrix in exploratory factor analysis; contrarily, individuals are classified into latent homogenous subgroups according to their responses in the mixture analysis (Collins & Lanza, 2010). The mixture analyses were carried out using MPlus Version 8.4 (Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, 1998\u20132017). To identify the optimal number of latent classes, we used Lo-MendellRubin adjusted likelihood ratio test (LMR-LRT) to compare k-class latent profile model with k-1 class latent profile model. In comparison to k-1-latent-class model, the LMRLRT assesses the optimal fit of the k-class latent mixture model considering sample size, log-likelihood values, number of parameters and number classes of the baseline and nested models (Lo et al., 2001). In addition, optimal latent profile models were evaluated using the Akaike information criterion (Akaike, 1987), the Bayesian information criterion (Schwarz, 1978), and the adjusted Bayesian information criterion with the lowest values preferred (Burnham & Anderson, 2004; Nylund et al., 2007; Preacher & Hayes, 2008). Entropy values greater than > .80 are indicative of excellent homogeneity for the k-class mixture model (Celeux & Soromenho, 1996; Clark, 2010; Wedel & Kamakura, 2000).\nIn the mixture analytic investigation of sample characteristics, item responses on the 28 items of the DES and 9 items of the ASRS capturing the inattention subscale were subjected to the latent class analysis using MPlus 8.4 (Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, 1998\u20132017). We used LMR-LRT to identify most parsimonious mixture model with optimal number of latent classes. Once the best class solution was determined, the optimal number of latent classes were obtained. Next, to explore cardinal features of the latent classes extracted through mixture analysis, the posterior Bayesian membership classification probabilities of each latent class was used as dependent variable in regression analysis. The DES total and the ASRS attention deficits subscale scores were\nWender Utah rating scale (WURS)\nWURS is a 25-item, five-point Likert type self-report scale that retrospectively questions childhood ADHD symptoms. It consists of five subscales: irritability (7 questions), affect (5 questions), academic problems (3 questions), behavioral problems/impulsivity (5 questions), and attention deficit (5 questions). The total score of the scale is obtained by adding the scores from all questions (Ward, 1993). 36 points were determined as the cut-off value for childhood ADHD symptoms. The WURS translated into Turkish by Oncu et al. (2005). The internal reliability of the Turkish version was \u03b1 = 0.93. The instrument was demonstrated to have an excellent concurrent validity with a sensitivity of 82.5% and specificity of 90.8% for ADHD (Oncu et al., 2005)."

We carried out latent profile analysis beginning from 1-latent-class to 4-latent-class model. We identified the best latent-class model using the Lo-Mendel-Rubin adjusted likelihood test (LMRT) which compares the k-latent-class model with k-1-latent-class model to indicate the significance of increase in model fit. The LMR-LRT showed that 4-latent-class model did not statistically significantly differ from 3-latent-class model (LMR-LRT = 1120.591, p = .4015). According to the parsimonious principle, we concluded that 3-latent-class model best fit the current data. In addition, the information criteria computed for the 3-latent-class model was lower than the nested models (AIC = 281205.185, BIC = 281946.798, and ABIC = 281470.379). Findings are presented in Table 2.\nWe assessed the internal consistency of the optimal 3-latent-class model using the relative entropy index = 0.94 which was indicative of high homogeneity of the overall latent classes greater than 0.80 (Celeux & Soromenho, 1996; Clark, 2010; Wedel & Kamakura, 2000). In addition, we found that average classification probabilities for the most likely latent class membership were high with the values of 0.980, 0.958, and 0.981, respectively. According to the guidelines (Nagin, 2005; Wang & Wang, 2020), we concluded that the 3-latent-class model had excellent level homogeneity within latent classes.\nIn an attempt to investigate the characteristics of the latent classes in terms of dissociative symptomatology and attention problems, we conducted two separate regression analyses on latent-class-membership probabilities for each latent class, in which the DES and ASRS inattention\nregressed onto membership classification probabilities for each latent class separately. In addition, using Mplus 8.4 (Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, 1998\u20132017), we carried out 3-step regression analysis (Asparouhov & Muthen, 2014) to explore the relationships of socio-demographic variables (age, gender, BMI, alcohol use, tobacco use, daily coffee consumption, and psychopathology among family members) with latent classes of the optimal mixture model.\nThe differences in psychological constructs across latent classes were investigated using the analysis of variance (ANOVA). We carried out the one-way ANOVAs to explore the differences between latent profiles on the mean scale scores on the DES total and subscales (Depersonalization/ Derealization, Absorption/Imaginative involvement, and Amnesia), SDQ total, ASRS total and subscales (Inattention and Hyperactivity/Impulsivity), WUS total and subscales (Irritability, Depression, School problems, Conduct problems/Impulsivity, and Attention deficit), and the CTQ total and subscales (Emotional Neglect, Emotional Abuse, Physical Neglect, Physical Abuse, and Sexual Abuse).\nFinally, the multivariate differences in variables of interest across latent classes were explored by using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Demographic characteristics (age, gender, body mass index, alcohol use, tobacco use, daily coffee consumption, and family psychopathology), the SDQ total, Hyperactivity/Impulsivity subscale of the ASRS, irritability, depression, school problems, conduct problems/impulsivity and attention deficit subscales of the WURS (childhood ADHD symptoms), and five subscales of the CTQ (emotional neglect, emotional abuse, physical neglect, physical abuse, and sexual abuse) were regressed onto the categorical dependent variable. The high dissociation with attention problems latent class group were taken as reference category in the logistic model.\n1 3\n28885\nCurrent Psychology (2023) 42:28881\u201328894\nTo explore the differences in socio-demographic characteristics (age, gender, BMI, alcohol use, tobacco use, daily coffee consumption, and psychopathology among family members) across latent classes, we conducted 3-step-regression analysis using Mplus 8.4 (Asparouhov & Muthen, 2014; Muth\u00e9n & Muth\u00e9n, 1998\u20132017). In the 3-step regression analysis, the 3-latent-class model was dependent and socio-demographic characteristics were independent variables. 3-step-regression analyses showed that individuals who had moderate dissociation with attention problems was younger than those classified into the no/low dissociation or attention problems (\u03b2= \u2212 0.098, p = .040); whereas individuals who had high dissociation with attention problems did not differ from other latent classes in their age (p > .05). Individuals who had moderate dissociation with attention problems reported higher frequency of family psychopathology than those classified into no/low dissociation or attention problems (\u03b2 = 0.501, p = .003); whereas individuals who had high dissociation with attention problems did not statistically significantly differ from other two latent classes (p > .05). Individuals who had high dissociation with attention problems reported more daily coffee consumption than those classified into no/low dissociation or attention problems (\u03b2 = 0.193, p < .001) as well as than those individuals with attention problems (\u03b2 = 0.260, p = .001). Latent classes subscale scores were independent variables, respectively. Dissociative symptoms (R2 = 0.678, \u03b2 = \u2212 0.823, t= -46.643, p < .001) and attention problems (R2 = 0.267, \u03b2 = \u2212 0.517, t= -19.427, p < .001) were found to be negatively associated with latent-class-1 membership probabilities. Therefore, this latent class was labeled as \u201cNo/low dissociation or attention problems\u201d. In the second set of regression analyses, the membership probabilities of latent-class-2 was the dependent variable. We found that both the DES (R2 = 0.135, \u03b2 = 0.368, t = 12.735, p < .001) and inattention subscale of the ASRS (R2 = 0.110, \u03b2 = 0.331, t = 11.291, p < .001) was statistically significantly associated with the classification probabilities of the respective latent class. The determination coefficients of the independent variables showed relatively moderate relationships with the latentclass probabilities. That is, the latent-class-2 was labeled as \u2018moderate dissociation with attention problems.\u2019 Finally, in the third set of regression analyses, the DES and ASRSinattention subscale scores were regressed onto the membership probabilities of latent-class-3. Regression analyses indicated that the DES scores highly (R2 = 0.531, \u03b2 = 0.729, t = 34.246, p < .001), and inattention moderately (R2 = 0.101, \u03b2 = 0.318 t = 10.802, p < .001) contributed to the unique variation of latent class probabilities. Hence, this latent class was labeled as \u2018High dissociation with attention problems.\u2019 Findings are represented in Table 3.\n1 3\n28886\nCurrent Psychology (2023) 42:28881\u201328894\ncharacteristics (age, gender, body mass index, alcohol use, tobacco use, daily coffee consumption, and family psychopathology). The independent variables in the model explained 46.8% of the unique variance of the dependent variable (Cox and Snell pseudo R2 = 0.468). The high dissociation with attention problems latent class was treated as the reference group in the analysis.\nWe found that, in comparison to high dissociators with attention problems latent class, being classified into the healthy control group were less likely to be associated with somatoform dissociation (Odds ratio = 0.792, 95% confidence interval = 0.762\u20130.822, p < .001), hyperactivity / impulsivity (Odds ratio = 0.841, 95% confidence interval = 0.793-0.892, p < .001), depression (Odds ratio = 0.909, 95% confidence interval = 0.832-0.992, p = .032), attention deficit (Odds ratio = 0.914, 95% confidence interval = 0.842\u2013 0.991, p = .030), emotional neglect (Odds ratio = 0.897, 95% confidence interval = 0.835\u20130.963, p = .003), and sexual abuse (Odds ratio = 0.909, 95% confidence interval = 0.826\u2013 0.999, p = .047).\nIn comparison to high dissociative participants, individuals\u2019 classification into moderate dissociation with attention problems latent class was less likely to be associated with somatoform dissociation (Odds ratio = 0.924, 95% confidence interval = 0.901\u20130.948, p < .001), school problems (Odds ratio = 0.874, 95% confidence interval = 0.786\u20130.971, p = .012), childhood emotional neglect (Odds ratio = 0.901, 95% confidence interval = 0.845\u20130.960, p = .001), and childhood physical abuse (Odds ratio = 0.888, 95% confidence interval = 0.796\u20130.990, p = .032). Intriguingly, both being grouped into no/low dissociation latent class (Odds ratio = 1.152, 95% confidence interval = 1.040\u20131.275, p = .007) and moderate dissociation latent class (Odds ratio = 1.189, 95% confidence interval = 1.089-1.300, p < .001) was positively significantly associated with childhood emotional abuse as compared to participants allocated into the high dissociation latent class.\nWhen the no/low dissociation or attention problems latent class was taken as the reference category, the multinomial logistic analysis indicated that moderate dissociation latent class was positively significantly associated with somatoform dissociation (Odds ratio = 1.167, 95% confidence interval = 1.133\u20131.203, p < .001), hyperactivity / impulsivity (Odds ratio = 1.129, 95% confidence interval = 1.088\u20131.172, p < .001), depression (Odds ratio = 1.101, 95% confidence interval = 1.038\u20131.167, p = .001), attention deficit (Odds ratio = 1.078, 95% confidence interval = 1.023\u20131.136, p = .005), and childhood sexual abuse (Odds ratio = 1.107, 95% confidence interval = 1.029\u20131.192, p = .007). Findings are presented in Table 5.\ndid not statistically differentiate in gender, body mass index, alcohol use, and tobacco use across latent classes (p > .05).\nTo explore the differences in psychological constructs across latent classes, we conducted one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). Using the Bonferroni multiple comparison test, post-hoc comparisons between latent classes were carried out. We compared the scores on the DES total and subscales (Depersonalization/ Derealization, Absorption/ Imaginative involvement, and Amnesia) and the SDQ total using ANOVAs. The analyses indicated that high dissociators with attention problems reported the highest scores on all aspects of dissociation (mental and somatoform dissociation), followed by those individuals who had moderate dissociation with attention problems. In comparison to both latent classes, individuals allocated into the no/low dissociation or attention problems had the lowest scores on overall and subscales of the DES and SDQ total.\nAs with the psychoform and somatoform dissociation scores, high dissociation with attention problems latent class had the greatest levels of inattention and hyperactivity/ impulsivity, followed by those individuals classified into the moderate dissociation with attention problems latent class, and the individuals with no/low dissociation or attention problems reported the lowest scores on the total and subscales of the ASRS. The same was true for the WURS overall and subscale scores (childhood ADHD symptoms such irritability, depression, school problems, conduct problems/ impulsivity, and attention deficit) which retrospectively measures emotional, behavioural and attentional problems during childhood.\nParticipants classified into the high dissociation with attention problems latent class reported more severe childhood traumatic experiences on overall and five subscales (emotional neglect, emotional abuse, physical neglect, physical abuse, and sexual abuse) of the CTQ than either moderate dissociation with attention problems latent class or no/low dissociation or attention problems latent class. Those individuals who were classified into moderate dissociation with attention problems latent class reported greater scores than no/low dissociation or attention problems group as well.

The finding can be accounted for by the moderation effects of childhood ADHD symptom clusters as measures by WURS and/or adult psychological symptoms on the relationship between dissociation and childhood emotional abuse. Further studies are needed addressing the issue in clinical samples.\nIt is well known that ADHD is characterized by delay and insufficiency in frontal cortex development and impaired executive functions. Research examining the relationship of dissociative symptoms with impairment in executive functioning was quite limited. In a sample of 185 university students, Giesbrecht et al. (2004) established the relationship between impairment in executive functions and dissociation as indexed by the DES, particularly amnesia but not with depersonalization or derealization. An experimental investigation of dissociative tendency in relation to executive functions showed that individuals high in dissociation endorsed significantly more executive difficulties than did individuals low in dissociation. Nevertheless, the observed difficulties were apparently not related to objective measures of their performance on the neuropsychological tests, rather subjective perception of executive impairment was an underpinning factor in the process of clinical manifestation of dissociation (Schurle Bruce et al., 2007). In another neuropsychological investigation of dissociative tendency showed that high-dissociative individuals revealed a better performance on executive function, but worse performance on a visual memory task than did low-dissociative participants. More importantly, dissociative symptoms were inversely associated with connectivity between the amygdala and right anterior insula in response to trauma-related scripts which can be interpreted as deficits in attentional control among highly dissociative traumatized individuals (Fani et al., 2019). Additionally, Chiu et al. (2016) showed that high dissociatiors had a better switch function, suggesting that this may be a cognitive endophenotype of dissociation, which helps to escape from traumatic cognitions and trauma-related focus. Mixture analysis of associations between the DES scores and attentions deficit symptoms as indexed by ASRS showed that dissociative symptomatology and attention problems have overlapping features. Further multivariate logistic analyses unfolded the group differences that individuals high or moderate in dissociation with attention problems were more likely to report hyperactivity/impulsivity, depression, attention deficit in childhood, and sexual abuse. Consistent with the accumulating evidence, our findings may suggest that both dissociation and"

            "text": "This study hypothesized that attention deficits specific to ADHD and dissociative experiences may overlap in symptom structures. The responses of a relatively large community sample of university students for the DES and attention deficit subscale of the ASRS were subjected to a latent class analysis. The results extracted three latent homogenous subgroups characterized by normal levels of dissociation and attention problems labeled as \u201cNo/low dissociation or attention problems\u201d, moderate dissociation with attention problems subgroup, and high dissociation with attention problems subgroup. Group differences in psychological variables of interest were identified by using ANOVAs and multinomal logistic regression analysis. The findings showed that dissociative individuals with attention deficits were more likely to report hyperactivity/impulsivity, depression, attention deficit in childhood, and sexual abuse in comparison to latent homogenous latent class of no/low dissociation or attention problems.\nChildhood trauma is a vulnerability factor for both psychoform and somatoform dissociation. Individuals exposed to childhood traumatic experiences are suggested to reveal a tendency to use dissociation to distance the psychologically injured self from disturbing sensations and cognitions related to trauma. The process may result in complicated clinical manifestations ranging from amnesia or paresthesia to identity fragmentation (Lyssenko et al., 2018; \u015ear, 2008). In line with the fragmented-self model of dissociation, we observed that individuals allocated in the high and moderate dissociation with attention difficulties latent classes revealed severe somatoform dissociative tendency accompanied by severe hyperactivity and impulsivity.\nThere is no consistent data on whether the subtypes of childhood traumatic experiences differentiate in predicting dissociative symptomatology. A recent meta-analysis aimed at answering this question, including 65 studies with 7352 abused or neglected individuals, reported that childhood sexual and physical abuse were the most robust correlates of dissociative symptoms (Vonderlin et al., 2018). In our study, the types of childhood trauma scores varied significantly between the latent classes which were highest in the high dissociation with attention problems group. In the logistic regression analysis, no/low dissociation or attention problems latent class membership was associated with low scores on sexual abuse, while high and moderate dissociation with attention problems latent class memberships were associated with high scores on emotional neglect. Another study demonstrated that emotional abuse was the most common type of childhood trauma in a sample of traumatized women, which was the strongest and most direct predictor of dissociation (Haferkamp et al., 2015). Although our\n1 3\n28890\nCurrent Psychology (2023) 42:28881\u201328894\na sizable minority in our sample (36%) reported clinical levels of dissociative symptomatology. The relationships between attention problems and dissociative experiences should be warranted in further studies after adjusting for the tentative influences of health anxiety.\nIn conclusion, this study aimed to examine the associations between ADHD and dissociative experiences in a large population of university students. To this end, the DES and attention deficit subscale item responses subjected to latent class analysis showed the heterogeneity of the shared variance between symptoms of these two clinical conditions. Childhood traumas, dissociative experiences, and both childhood and adulthood ADHD scores were significantly differed across three latent classes. We concluded that dissociation and attention deficit symptoms may have overlapping aspects phenomenologically. Our findings should be warranted in future functional brain imaging studies of functional connectivity patterns serving as an endophenotype of ADHD and/or dissociation.\nFunding The author(s) reported there is no funding associated with the work featured in this article.\nData Availability The data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author, upon reasonable request."
