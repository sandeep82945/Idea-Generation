 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Apply the nHWT-DIMS models to other time series forecasting problems beyond electricity demand, such as sales forecasting, weather forecasting, etc. The flexibility of the models to handle multiple seasonalities and special events could be useful in many forecasting applications.

2. Develop more sophisticated methods for automatically detecting and incorporating special events into the models as DIMS. Rather than relying on a predefined calendar, use data-driven methods to identify potential special events.

3. Experiment with more advanced optimization algorithms for estimating the smoothing parameters, such as genetic algorithms, simulated annealing, etc. The simplex method used currently could potentially get stuck in local optima.

4. Incorporate exogenous variables like weather data more systematically into the models rather than just day of week and holidays. Explore how to best integrate additional covariates into the nHWT-DIMS framework.

5. Apply deep learning methods like LSTM neural networks for the time series forecasting instead of shallow neural networks. Deep learning has shown promise for modeling complex nonlinear patterns in time series data.
