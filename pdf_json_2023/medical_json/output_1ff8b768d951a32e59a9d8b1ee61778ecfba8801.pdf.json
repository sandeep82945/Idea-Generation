Here, the effect of \u03b2 on ion-temperature-gradient-driven (ITG) turbulence is studied in Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X), showing that subdominant kinetic ballooning modes (KBMs) are unstable well below the ideal MHD threshold and get strongly excited in the turbulence.

Electrostatic microinstabilities and turbulence have been studied in detail in both tokamaks [1\u20136] and stellarators [7\u201312]. In high-performance regimes, the plasma will have substantial normalized plasma pressure \u03b2\u2261 \u03b2e \u00bc 8\u03c0neTe=B2ref , where ne is the electron density, Te is the electron temperature, and Bref is the reference magnetic field. Note \u03b2total \u00bc \u03b2i \u00fe \u03b2e. This parameter is an indicator of reactor efficiency as reaction rates scale with \u03b22. However, finite \u03b2 can modify electrostatic modes and produce electromagnetic instabilities. Finite-\u03b2 studies have been carried out for tokamaks [13\u201330] and to a lesser extent for stellarators [31\u201335]. Such studies aid in improving reactor efficiency, and are of increasing relevance as Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) prepares to operate at high \u03b2. Therefore, a comprehensive understanding of how finite \u03b2 alters electrostatic turbulence and brings forth electromagnetic turbulence regimes, driven by instabilities such as the kinetic ballooning mode (KBM), is becoming increasingly important in fusion research. In this Letter, a gyrokinetic study is presented of finite-\u03b2 turbulence in W7-X geometry revealing a novel process involving enhanced transport due to KBM excitation well below the ideal MHD ballooning threshold \u03b2MHDcrit . Depending on the device and regime, finite-\u03b2 studies have\nshown both positive and negative impacts on stability and turbulent transport. \u03b2 can suppress the growth of the iontemperature-gradient-driven (ITG) instability [21\u201323,36\u201339] and can reduce the transport levels associated with its turbulence [22,23,25,27,28,31,34]. In other cases, high \u03b2\ncan have a disruptive influence on the efficacy of saturation, whereby zonal flows are eroded by radial motion of electrons in microstochastic fields [40\u201345]. Electromagnetic stellarator turbulence studieshavebeencarriedout forNationalCompact Stellarator Experiment [46], LargeHelicalDevice [24,25,31], and more recently for Helically Symmetric Experiment [34], in addition to linear studies of electromagnetic instability behavior for W7-X [32,35] and global electromagnetic turbulence studies for W7-X [47\u201349]. In LHD and HSX, it has been shown that a KBM-dominated turbulence regime may be more desirable than an ITG-dominated regime, based on the reduction in heat flux seen at large \u03b2. In contrast, this Letter reveals that a well-behaved KBM-dominated turbulence regime is not obtained in certain W7-X configurations, and instead, ITG-dominated turbulent fluxes increasewhile \u03b2 is far below the linear threshold of KBM dominance \u03b2KBMcrit , and fail to saturate near \u03b2KBMcrit . This enhancement is due to a newly discovered process involving subdominant KBMs coupling to the zonal flow in ITG-dominated turbulence. The strong excitation of KBMs with increasing \u03b2 leads to a monotonic increase in transport. This is dissimilar to the previously reported nonzonal transition [43\u201345], which is marked by a sudden transport blowup at a critical \u03b2 without KBM involvement. Thus, this Letter reports a physically distinct mechanism whose presence may be predicted from linear simulations alone. This result holds substantial implications for stellarator experiments attempting to achieve high performance, given that high-\u03b2 operation is a key promise of the W7-X stellarator. Notably, W7-X\u2019s optimization relies on MHD stability [50] and not on turbulence properties. Thus, this\n0031-9007=23=131(18)=185101(6) 185101-1 \u00a9 2023 American Physical Society\nLetter motivates new approaches to stellarator optimization for electromagnetic instabilities and turbulence. Simulation setup and dominant linear stability.\u2014 Numerical studies are based on flux-tube simulations using the local GENE code [51]. Simulations use an MHDoptimized high-mirror configuration of W7-X [32]. This configuration has mirror ratio 10%, rotational transform \u03b9 \u00bc 1 on axis and no horizontal shift [35]. The neoclassical optimization of this configuration makes it a promising candidate for higher resilience to electromagnetic microinstabilities [32]. Simulations use a flux tube centered at the outboard midplane of the bean-shaped plane [52], where one poloidal turn is sufficient for numerical convergence. The bean-shaped cross section was chosen as it corresponds to the most MHD-unstable region of \u201cbad\u201d normal curvature [32,35]. Furthermore, T i=Te \u00bc 1, ni=ne \u00bc 1, mi=me \u00bc 1836, the radial position is r=a \u00bc 0.7 [normalized toroidal flux s0 \u00bc \u03c8\u00f0r\u00de=\u03c8\u00f0a\u00de \u00bc 0.5], with normalized gradients a=LTi \u00bc 3.5, a=LTe \u00bc 0, a=Lni \u00bc a=Lne \u00bc 1. Here, Tj is the temperature of species j, while mj is the mass, r is the minor-radial coordinate, a is the minor radius, and LTj \u00bc \u2212\u00f0d lnTj=dr\u00de\u22121 and Lnj \u00bc \u2212\u00f0d ln nj=dr\u00de\u22121 are the scale lengths of the temperature and density, respectively. At radial positions s0 \u00bc 0.3\u20130.6, KBMs are expected to be present and detectable by experiment [35]. Setting a=LTe \u00bc 0 was chosen to maximise a=LTi and decrease \u03b2KBMcrit below the MHD limit \u03b2 MHD crit , given that the total sum of normalized gradients is held constant for a given s0 and \u03b2KBMcrit depends more strongly on a=LTi [16,22,32]. However, we find that \u03b2KBMcrit in W7-X is largely dependent on the total sum of gradients, and not on a specific gradient [26]. This is in line with the KBM being a pressure-gradient-driven instability, such that all gradients contribute to its growth. An additional study at r=a \u00bc 0.76 (s0 \u00bc 0.58) including a=LTe \u00bc 1.75 is presented in Fig. 2 (gray data, empty symbols). The inclusion of a=LTe allows for stronger prediction of experimental performance. Notably, including a=LTe yields analogous trends to a=LTe \u00bc 0. Thus, throughout this Letter and without loss of generality, focus is given to a=LTe \u00bc 0 (unless otherwise stated). Equilibria were created with the VMEC code [53], using the pressure-profile procedure described in [35]. For scans in \u03b2, distinct VMEC equilibria are used whose volume-averaged \u03b2 varies with the local \u03b2. Furthermore, a self-consistent sum of the normalized gradients is used,P\nj\u00bci;e a=LTj \u00fe a=Lnj \u00bc 5.5 for radial position s0 \u00bc 0.5 (and 7.25 for s0 \u00bc 0.58). This \u03b1-consistent approach (\u03b1 being the normalized pressure gradient) ensures the equilibrium is self-consistent with the pressure gradient of the simulation. Deviations from this level of consistency can cause discrepancies in \u03b2KBMcrit [32]. Figure 1 shows linear growth rates \u03b3 and real frequencies \u03c9r as functions of \u03b2, comparing different poloidal wavenumbers ky normalized to the inverse ion sound gyroradius \u03c1s. Discontinuities in frequency mark the regime transition between dominant ITG and dominantKBM,where the latter has a steeply increasing growth ratewith \u03b2. These results are\nconsistent with previous studies [22,23,25,26,31,32,34], with the exception of the absence of ITG suppression for ky \u2264 0.4 at 2% < \u03b2 < 3%, possibly a consequence of the self-consistent approach [29]. To obtain the approximate \u03b2 where \u03b3KBM > 0, one commonly extrapolates \u03b3 in the KBM-dominant regime to \u03b3 \u00bc 0, which here yields a threshold \u03b2 \u2248 3\u20133.5%. Also, given that the linear ITG is either suppressed or only moderately affected for \u03b2 < 3%, one may intuitively expect to see analogous behavior of the turbulence levels in this range of \u03b2. Nonlinear simulations.\u2014Figure 2 shows the nonlinear electrostatic ion heat flux Qesi averaged over the turbulent state for various \u03b2, together with linear growth rates for ky \u00bc 0.2. Note that the electron and electromagnetic fluxes are small for a=LTe \u00bc 0. For this W7-X configuration, \u03b2KBMcrit > 3% for the fixed sum of gradients used here, while \u03b2MHDcrit \u2248 3%. Therefore, one does not expect well-behaved saturated turbulence in the KBM-dominant regime.\n185101-2\nConvergence was achieved using Nx \u00bc 256 radial points, Nky \u00bc 24 Fourier modes in ky with the smallest finite value 0.05, Nz \u00bc 256 grid points along the field line, Nvk \u00bc 32 grid points for parallel velocity space, and N\u03bc \u00bc 12 grid points for the magnetic moment. The heat flux is mostly unaffected for 0 < \u03b2 < 1%, before sizable increases manifest for \u03b2 > 1%. Fully saturated turbulence is achieved up to \u03b2 \u2248 2.6%, before fluxes increase rapidly without bound for \u03b2 > \u03b2MHDcrit \u2248 3%. The substantial increase in heat flux for 1% < \u03b2 < 3% is unexpected and cannot be explained by the dominant-instability behavior alone. The nonlinear heat-flux spectra, see Fig. 3, start broad for the electrostatic case \u03b2 \u00bc 0.01% and become narrow at high \u03b2, peakingprimarily at ITG-dominant ky \u00bc 0.3 \u2212 0.4, and to a lesser extent, at lower ky \u00bc 0.05 \u2212 0.1. Nonlinear frequencies (not shown), compared with the dominant linear frequencies are primarily in the ITG range at \u03b2 \u2248 1%, but include a higher-frequency signature\u2014characteristic of the\nKBM\u2014at \u03b2 > 2%. Nonlinear cross phases (not shown) of the high-\u03b2 turbulence mostly resemble those found for dominant linear ITGs at high \u03b2. These diagnostics suggest that the high-\u03b2 turbulence is driven by a mixture of ITGs and KBMs. Tounderstandwhat processes couldbecausing the increase\nin heat flux, consider the saturation mechanism at low \u03b2, where zonal flows play a critical role (see Refs. [54,55] and references therein). Zonal flows are excited to substantial amplitudes for \u03b2 \u2272 1%. However, at \u03b2 \u2248 2%, substantial zonal-flow reduction occurs and streamerlike structures form that span \u2248100\u03c1s, accompanied by a substantial drop in the normalized zonal potential j\u03a6zonalj2=j\u03a6nonzonalj2. Here, \u03a6zonal \u2261\u03a6\u00f0ky \u00bc 0\u00de and \u03a6nonzonal \u2261Pky>0\u03a6\u00f0ky\u00de. At \u03b2 \u00bc 1.11%, j\u03a6zonalj2=j\u03a6nonzonalj2 \u2248 9, while at \u03b2 \u00bc 2.27%, j\u03a6zonalj2=j\u03a6nonzonalj2 \u2248 1. This supports the notion that the increasing heat flux with \u03b2 is due to a reduced zonal flow. To address whether zonal-flow generation has been\ninterrupted or the zonal flows have been eroded, the effect of \u03b2 on secondary instability is measured [56,57]. Zonal modes (kx \u2260 0 and ky \u00bc 0) grow exponentially via a threewave interaction involving the ITG streamer (kx \u00bc 0 and ky \u2260 0)\u2014held constant in time\u2014coupled with sidebands (kx \u2260 0 and ky \u2260 0). These simulations consider 17 complex modes in kx centered around kx \u00bc 0 and at ky \u00bc 0.4 and 0.8, which correspond to strong linear growth. Secondaryinstability analysis constitutes a simplified model involving a subset of the mode couplings present in the turbulence, but mirrors the zonal-flow-related energetics of the turbulent system [44]. Zonal-flow growth rates are measured at each \u03b2 separately, where the amplitudes are normalized, following the standard approach [57]. Increasing \u03b2 from 1.11% to 2.27%slightly reduces zonal-modegrowth ratesbyO\u00f010%\u00de, which is unlikely to explain the significant reduction in zonal-flow amplitude. Second, magnetic stochasticity is quantified at low and\nhigh \u03b2, which can reveal if radial motion of electrons is able to erode the zonal flow [40\u201345]. This is done by evaluating the field-line diffusivity [44]\nDfl\u00f0l; p\u00de \u00bc \u00bd\u0394r\u00f0l; p\u00de 2\n2\u03c0q0a\u00f0p\u00fe 1\u00de ; \u00f01\u00de\nwhich measures the radial displacement \u0394r\u00f0l; p\u00de \u00bc r\u00f0l; p\u00de \u2212 r\u00f0l; 0\u00de of field-line l after poloidal turn p, where q0 is the safety factor. Here, diffusivity is averaged over the quasistationary state using ten poloidal turns, showing an increase from 0.0053 \u03c12s=a to 0.11 \u03c12s=a as \u03b2 increases from 1.11% to 2.27%. Furthermore, at \u03b2 \u00bc 2.27%, the zonal-flow decay time (1.23 a=cs) has become shorter than the turbulent correlation time (3.92 a=cs), supporting the notion that zonal-flow erosion is a dynamically relevant effect [42,43]. Therefore, the zonal flow is much harder to maintain with increasing \u03b2, lowering its ability to saturate turbulence.\n185101-3\nTypically, stochasticity is produced by modes with even parity in the magnetic vector potential Ak [40,41,58]. Tearing parity (odd parity in \u03a6, even parity in Ak) is seen in the present case when averaging over the quasistationary state. In particular, a proper orthogonal decomposition reveals that the tearing-parity contribution to Ak increases at ky \u00bc 0.1 \u2212 0.25 when \u03b2 > 2%. Eigenmode spectra and projection.\u2014At different ky, eigenvalue calculations are performed to study the subdominant spectrum. Resolutions for the eigenvalue calculations are the same as for nonlinear simulations, with the exception of Nx \u00bc 29. To assess the excitation of various eigenmodes in the turbulence, the nonadiabatic part of the perturbed distribution function gNL is projected onto eigenvector gj at a given time, thus obtaining the projection [41,59,60]\npj \u00bc j R d\u03b8g jgNLj\n\u00f0R d\u03b8jgjj2 R d\u03b8jgNLj2\u00de1=2\n; \u00f02\u00de\ngiving the excitation of the jth eigenmode, which is then averaged over the turbulent state. Here, \u03b8 is the extended ballooningangle [13,61], anda summationoverbothparticle species is implicit. If pj \u00bc 1, the nonlinear state is captured by a single eigenmode, whereas a mode with pj \u00bc 0 is orthogonal to the nonlinear state. The set of eigenmodes itself is not orthogonal, and generally P j pj > 1.\nFigures 4 and 5 show the eigenspectra and projections at ky \u00bc 0.2 for \u03b2 \u00bc 1.11% and 2.27%, respectively. Two clusters of modes can be identified: an ITG cluster (\u03c9r < 0.3 cs=a) and a KBM cluster (\u03c9r > 0.3 cs=a). The projections reveal several large-amplitude subdominant modes (\u03b3 < \u03b3max) within both clusters. KBM excitation increases as \u03b2 increases from 1.11% to 2.27%, where in the latter case, some modes in the KBM cluster surpass the highest-projection ITGs. The relative orthogonality between all modes is measured qualitatively using a\nmodified form of Eq. (2) (replacing gNL with gk, k \u2260 j). The mode of interest in the KBM cluster (stKBM in Figs. 4 and 5) has< 17% similarity to the high-projection ITGs. In contrast, another high-projection mode in the KBM cluster has \u224858% similarity and \u224830% \u2212 38% similarity to the high-projection ITGs and stKBM, respectively. Thus, the large excitation of this mode is unlikely to be primarily associated with its direct influence on the turbulence, whereas the highly excited and largely distinct stKBM and ITGs are expected to play a unique and significant role. A more fine-grained study has been carried out for\nincremental increases in \u03b2, revealing that a single KBM becomes unstable for \u03b2 \u2248 1% (the subthreshold KBM, destabilized at \u03b2stKBMcrit ) and has a slowly increasing \u03b3 up to \u03b2KBMcrit \u2248 3%, at which point \u03b3 increases rapidly. This evolution of the KBM from soft onset to rapid growth is visible in Fig. 1 (blue inverted triangles), where for \u03b2 > 3% this single KBM has split off from the KBM cluster and has become the dominant instability. This novel property of the KBM having a soft onset\u2014while being strongly excited in the turbulence\u2014implies that one cannot reliably use extrapolation in Fig. 1 to obtain the threshold where the KBM first impacts the system dynamics. Eigenspectra at ky \u00bc 0.3 and 0.4 (not shown) contain analogous ITG and KBM clusters; however, the excitation of KBMs remains lower than of ITGs for both \u03b2 \u00bc 1.11% and 2.27% at these wavenumbers. Thus, the primary impact of KBMs on the turbulence is to act as an unprecedented catalyst that enables ITGs to produce larger fluctuations and fluxes at ky \u00bc 0.3\u20130.4. A likely candidate is the nonlinear energy transfer between zonal flows and stable tearing-parity modes with 0 < ky < 0.2 aided by subthreshold KBMs, which causes the observed magnetic stochasticity, zonal-flow suppression, and flux increase. All unstable tearing-parity eigenmodes are found to have very low excitation (p < 0.08), such that they are unlikely to have significant impact on the turbulence.\n185101-4\nAs mentioned earlier, \u03b2KBMcrit is largely unaffected by the relative balance of normalized gradients, but is set by their total sum. Figure 2 shows the reduction of \u03b2KBMcrit when including a=LTe \u00bc 1.75. Notably, \u03b2stKBMcrit is also reduced in this case, showing the similar response of stKBM and dominant KBM to an increased sum of normalized gradients. The low threshold \u03b2stKBMcrit < \u03b2 MHD crit may be attributable to the low magnetic shear of W7-X, s\u0302 \u00bc \u2212\u00f0r=\u03b9\u00ded\u03b9=dr \u226a 1 (relatedly, \u03b2KBMcrit \u221d js\u0302j), in combination with an ionmagnetic-drift resonance whereby thermal ions exchange energy with the drift wave [26,34,62\u201364]. An in-depth study on the effects of magnetic shear on KBMs in W7-X will be presented in future work. Conclusions.\u2014This Letter presents a novel process whereby electromagnetic turbulence is shown to have a significant and detrimental impact on energy confinement in W7-X for a high-performance scenario. In particular, the excitation of subdominant KBMs is shown to catalyze a form of zonal-flow degradation, allowing for enhanced ITG-driven transport as \u03b2 is gradually increased. This Letter examines the effect of high \u03b2 on the ITG\ninstability and defines distinct thresholds for KBM destabilization (\u03b2stKBMcrit \u2248 1%) and the much higher threshold of KBM dominance (\u03b2KBMcrit \u2248 3%). Nonlinear simulations show increasing heat fluxes with \u03b2, starting from \u03b2 \u2248 1% and continuing up to the MHD limit \u03b2MHDcrit \u2248 3%, despite insensitivity of linear ITG growth rates to \u03b2 and heat fluxes peaking at ITG-dominant wavenumbers. This is caused by zonal-flow reduction stemming from the eroding effect of magnetic stochasticity, which increases substantially with \u03b2. Projection analyses reveal the strong excitation of stKBMs in the turbulence as \u03b2 increases. Therefore, nonlinear energy transfer\u2014catalyzed by stKBMs\u2014between the zonal flow and stable tearing-parity modes is the likely cause of the observed increase in stochasticity, zonal-flow reduction, and heat-flux increase. Further investigation into this nonlinear process will be reported in the future. Including a=LTe \u00bc 1.75 yields analogous results to a=LTe \u00bc 0, with the modification that both stKBM destabilization and heat-flux increase occur at a reduced \u03b2 \u2248 0.7%. This indicates that KBM-enhanced transport may be even more prevalent in experimentally relevant scenarios. The results reported here for W7-X may prove to be\nbroadly applicable to low-magnetic-shear stellarators, and have significant implications regarding their maximum achievable \u03b2 and thus reactor performance. Moreover, this calls into question the viability of seeking configurations with high ideal MHD ballooning limits in stellarator optimization efforts. Optimizing magnetic geometries for high fusion performance will likely require accounting for stKBM activity via linear eigenvalue simulations. Controlling stKBMs will thus be essential for stellarators,\nand will pave the way for successful high-performance discharges in future reactor designs.\nThis work has been carried out within the framework of the EUROfusion Consortium, funded by the European Union via the Euratom Research and Training Programme (Grant No. 101052200\u2014EUROfusion).
