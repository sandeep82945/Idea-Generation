The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of high levels of maternal exposure to ambient air pollution and heavy metals on risks of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and epilepsy using the National Health Insurance claims data of South Korea. The data of mothers and their newborns from 2016 to 2018 provided by the National Health Insurance Service were used (n = 843,134). Data on exposure to ambient air pollutants (PM2.5, CO, SO2, NO2, and O3) and heavy metals (Pb, Cd, Cr, Cu, Mn, Fe, Ni, and As) during pregnancy were matched based on the mother’s National Health Insurance registration area. SO2 (OR: 2.723, 95% CI: 1.971–3.761) and Pb (OR: 1.063, 95% CI: 1.019–1.11) were more closely associated with the incidence of ASD when infants were exposed to them in the third trimester of pregnancy. Pb (OR: 1.109, 95% CI: 1.043–1.179) in the first trimester of pregnancy and Cd (OR: 2.193, 95% CI: 1.074–4.477) in the third trimester of pregnancy were associated with the incidence of epilepsy. Thus, exposure to SO2, NO2, and Pb during pregnancy could affect the development of a neurologic disorder based on the timing of exposure, suggesting a relationship with fetal development. However, further research is needed. 1. conclusions The findings of this study suggest that exposure to SO2, NO2, and Pb during pregnancy can affect the development of neurologic disorders according to the timing of exposure, indicating that such exposure is related to fetal development.
