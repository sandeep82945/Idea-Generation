    "abstractText": "Soft porous materials, such as biological tissues and soils, are exposed to periodic deformations in a variety of natural and industrial contexts. The detailed flow and mechanics of these deformations have not yet been systematically investigated. Here, we fill this gap by identifying and exploring the complete parameter space associated with periodic deformations in the context of a one-dimensional model problem. We use large-deformation poroelasticity to consider a wide range of loading periods and amplitudes. We identify two distinct mechanical regimes, distinguished by whether the loading period is slow or fast relative to the characteristic poroelastic timescale. We develop analytical solutions for slow loading at any amplitude and for infinitesimal amplitude at any period. We use these analytical solutions and a full numerical solution to explore the localisation of the deformation near the permeable boundary as the period decreases and the emergence of nonlinear effects as the amplitude increases. We show that large deformations lead to asymmetry between the loading and unloading phases of each cycle in terms of the distributions of porosity and fluid flux.",

The detailed flow and mechanics of these deformations have not yet been systematically investigated. Here, we fill this gap by identifying and exploring the complete parameter space associated with periodic deformations in the context of a one-dimensional model problem. We use large-deformation poroelasticity to consider a wide range of loading periods and amplitudes. We identify two distinct mechanical regimes, distinguished by whether the loading period is slow or fast relative to the characteristic poroelastic timescale. We develop analytical solutions for slow loading at any amplitude and for infinitesimal amplitude at any period. We use these analytical solutions and a full numerical solution to explore the localisation of the deformation near the permeable boundary as the period decreases and the emergence of nonlinear effects as the amplitude increases. We show that large deformations lead to asymmetry between the loading and unloading phases of each cycle in terms of the distributions of porosity and fluid flux.\nKey words: porous media, biomedical flows"

Periodic loads are also commonly applied in regenerative medicine to improve cell differentiation in scaffolds via mechanotransduction (Kim et al. 1999; Butler, Goldstein & Guilak 2000; Mauck et al. 2000; Grenier et al. 2005; Haj, Hampson & Gogniat 2009; Gauvin et al. 2011; Amrollahi & Tayebi 2015; Peroglio et al. 2018). Soils and sediments experience periodic loading due to seismicity (Genna & Cividini 1989; Li, Borja & Regueiro 2004; Popescu et al. 2006; Bonazzi, Jha & de Barros 2021), vehicle traffic (Hu, Zhu & Cheng 2011; Ni et al. 2015; Ni & Geng 2022) and ocean waves and tides (Madsen 1978; Yamamoto et al. 1978; Karim, Nogami & Wang 2002; Cheng 2016; Trefry et al. 2019).\nFrom a poromechanical point of view, periodic loading is fundamentally different from steady loading because the long-time response is inherently oscillatory and therefore time-dependent. Most previous work on periodic loading has focused on internal stress and/or pressure profiles, on macroscopic observables such as surface motion or net inflow or outflow, or on solute concentration profiles.\nPeriodic loading due to seismicity is a classical topic in poroelasticity (Biot 1956a,b). Seismicity involves frequencies that are high enough for inertia to play a dominant role. As a result, seismic response is typically dominated by the propagation of compressional and shear acoustic waves (e.g. Biot 1956a,b; Li et al. 2004; Gajo & Denzer 2011; Liu et al. 2019). In contrast, ocean waves and tides are typically associated with a low enough frequency that inertia can be ignored (e.g. Madsen 1978; Yamamoto et al. 1978; Cheng 2016). Instead, these studies typically focus on the pressure and stress profiles within seabed sediments in response to periodic fluctuations in hydrostatic pressure. The sediment is usually taken to be semi-infinite, the associated deformations are assumed to be small, and the response is often dominated by compressibility. Tidal forcing in coastal aquifers often has similar features (e.g. Trefry et al. 2019).\nOur primary motivation here is tissue mechanics, where inertia and compressibility are usually negligible but moderate to large deformations are common. In this regime, poroelasticity is physically diffusive with a characteristic poroelastic relaxation time. For bone and cartilage, linear poroelasticity has been used to model the macroscopic mechanical response and/or the distribution of pore pressure during small periodic deformations (e.g. Zhang & Cowin 1994; Manfredini et al. 1999; Riches et al. 2002; Kameo, Adachi & Hojo 2008; Yaogeng et al. 2018). Zhang & Cowin (1994) showed that the magnitude and distribution of pore pressure depend strongly on the loading period, introducing the ratio of the loading period to the poroelastic relaxation time as a key dimensionless control parameter. For cartilage and hydrogel scaffolds, both linear and nonlinear poroelasticity have been used to model the impact of periodic deformations on the transport of solutes, typically by comparing the concentration profile at the end of loading across a small set of different loading conditions (e.g. Mauck et al. 2003; Ferguson et al. 2004; Sengers et al. 2004; Gardiner et al. 2007; Urciuolo, Imparato & Netti 2008; Zhang 2011; Vaughan et al. 2013). Several of these studies noted that faster loading (shorter loading period) is associated with larger fluid velocities that are localised near the surface, whereas slower loading (longer loading period) is associated with intermediate fluid velocities that penetrate more deeply (Gardiner et al. 2007; Kameo et al. 2008; Urciuolo et al. 2008; Di Domenico et al. 2017; Vaughan et al. 2013). Gardiner et al. (2007) further noted that, for small deformations, the magnitude of the fluid velocity is\n974 A2-2\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n74 7\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nroughly proportional to the loading amplitude, whereas the penetration depth is relatively insensitive to amplitude. Despite this extensive previous work, many basic features of flow and deformation due to periodic loading have not yet been systematically studied, in part because most of the above studies have focused on relatively narrow regions of the associated parameter space and/or on relatively small sets of specific results. For example, kinematic and constitutive nonlinearities (characteristic of large deformations and nonlinear constitutive behaviour, respectively) become increasingly important as the amplitude grows, but the emergence of these nonlinearities has not been investigated. Moreover, the impacts of the deformation on the magnitude and distribution of the fluid flux, directly relevant to the transport of solutes, have not been examined.\nHere, we study the periodic loading of a soft porous material over a wide range of loading periods (from very slow to very fast) and amplitudes (from infinitesimal to moderate/large) in the context of a simple one-dimensional model problem. Following MacMinn, Dufresne & Wettlaufer (2016), our large-deformation poroelastic model is kinematically rigorous and includes both deformation-dependent permeability and nonlinear elasticity. We characterise the motion of the fluid and the solid throughout the loading cycle, focusing on the evolution of porosity and fluid flux, which are particularly relevant for the transport of solutes. We develop a series of analytical solutions that describe loading with small amplitude but arbitrary period (\u00a7\u00a7 3.2\u20133.4) and loading with large period but arbitrary amplitude (\u00a7 3.5). We then solve the full problem numerically and compare with our analytical results. We use these solutions to examine the transition from very slow loading to very fast loading and from infinitesimal to large amplitudes, as well as the role of the initial porosity. Finally, we discuss the relevance of these results to some specific biological and biomedical scenarios."

Macroscopically, the deformation is strictly compressive in the sense that a(t) \u2265 0.\nWe consider deformations ranging from small to large macroscopic nominal strain (\u22120.4 % to \u221220 % or 0.004 \u2264 A/L \u2264 0.2), with commensurate macroscopic changes in bulk (total) volume. We assume that the fluid and the solid phases are individually incompressible, so that the total volume of solid is constant and any change in bulk volume must correspond to a change in total pore (fluid) volume via a rearrangement of the pore structure and an influx or an efflux of fluid at the left boundary.\n974 A2-3\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n74 7\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\n2.2. Kinematics We work in an Eulerian reference frame, in which the solid displacement field is us = x \u2212 X (x, t), with X (x, t) the reference position of the material point that at time t occupies the position x. We choose X (x, 0) \u2261 x so that us(x, 0) = 0, in which case the reference configuration is the relaxed configuration. We denote the true volume fractions of fluid and solid by \u03c6f and \u03c6s, respectively, where \u03c6f + \u03c6s = 1. The flow and deformation are uniaxial, such that\nus = us(x, t)e\u0302x, vs = vs(x, t)e\u0302x, vf = vf (x, t)e\u0302x, (2.2a\u2013c) where us, vs and vf are the x-components of the solid displacement field and the solid and fluid velocity fields, respectively, and e\u0302x is the unit vector in the x-direction.\nIn one dimension, the local state of deformation is fully characterised by the Jacobian determinant J = (1 \u2212 \u2202us/\u2202x)\u22121, which measures the local current volume per unit reference volume. For incompressible constituents and uniform initial porosity \u03c6f ,0, the local change in volume is linked to the change in porosity according to\nJ(x, t) = 1 \u2212 \u03c6f ,0 1 \u2212 \u03c6f \u2192 \u2202us \u2202x = \u03c6f \u2212 \u03c6f ,0 1 \u2212 \u03c6f ,0 . (2.3)\nContinuity for this one-dimensional system can be written\n\u2202\u03c6f \u2202t + \u2202 \u2202x (\u03c6f vf ) = 0 and \u2202\u03c6f \u2202t \u2212 \u2202 \u2202x [(1 \u2212 \u03c6f )vs] = 0, (2.4a,b)\nwhich together imply that the total flux q = \u03c6f vf + (1 \u2212 \u03c6f )vs is uniform in space, \u2202q/\u2202x = 0.\n2.3. Darcy\u2019s law We assume that the movement of the fluid relative to the solid skeleton is described by Darcy\u2019s law,\n\u03c6f (vf \u2212 vs) = \u2212k(\u03c6f ) \u03bc \u2202p \u2202x , (2.5)\nwhere k(\u03c6f ) is the permeability of the solid skeleton, \u03bc is the dynamic viscosity of the fluid and p is the fluid (pore) pressure, and where we have neglected gravity. We have\n974 A2-4\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n74 7\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\ntaken the permeability k(\u03c6f ) to be a function of porosity only. For simplicity, we use a normalised Kozeny\u2013Carman relation for deformation-dependent permeability (MacMinn et al. 2016):\nk(\u03c6f ) = k0 (1 \u2212 \u03c6f ,0) 2\n\u03c63f ,0\n\u03c63f\n(1 \u2212 \u03c6f )2 , (2.6)\nwhere k0 \u2261 k(\u03c6f ,0) is the reference permeability. Kozeny\u2013Carman permeability is a common choice for gels and soft tissues (Malandrino et al. 2014; Sacco et al. 2014; Rahbari et al. 2017; Gao & Cho 2022). We compare it with a simpler power-law formulation in Appendix A, showing that the two are qualitatively and quantitatively similar and are expected to produce similar behaviour.\n2.4. Fluid flow Combining (2.4a,b) and (2.5), we arrive at the nonlinear flow equations:\n\u2202\u03c6f \u2202t + \u2202 \u2202x\n[ \u03c6f q \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03c6f )k(\u03c6f )\n\u03bc \u2202p \u2202x\n] = 0 and \u2202q\n\u2202x = 0, (2.7a,b)\nwhere the total flux q is again\nq \u2261 \u03c6f vf + (1 \u2212 \u03c6f )vs. (2.8) The Darcy-scale fluid velocity and solid velocity are then given by\nvf = q \u2212 1 \u2212 \u03c6f \u03c6f k(\u03c6f ) \u03bc \u2202p \u2202x and vs = q + k(\u03c6f ) \u03bc \u2202p \u2202x . (2.9a,b)\nand the local fluid flux is\nqf = \u03c6f vf . (2.10)\n2.5. Mechanical equilibrium The true Cauchy total stress \u03c3 is supported jointly by the fluid phase and the solid phase. The total stress can be decomposed into a contribution from the fluid pressure p and a contribution from Terzaghi\u2019s effective stress \u03c3 \u2032,\n\u03c3 = \u03c3 \u2032 \u2212 pI, (2.11) where we adopt the sign convention of tension being positive. Neglecting inertia and body forces, mechanical equilibrium can be written\n\u2207 \u00b7 \u03c3 = \u2207 \u00b7 \u03c3 \u2032 \u2212 \u2207p = 0. (2.12) In one dimension, (2.12) implies that\n\u2202\u03c3 \u2032\n\u2202x = \u2202p \u2202x , (2.13)\nwhere \u03c3 \u2032 is the xx component of \u03c3 \u2032.\n974 A2-5\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n74 7\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\n2.6. Elasticity law The effective stress is the portion of the total stress that contributes to deformation of the solid skeleton. We take the solid skeleton to be elastic, with no viscous or dissipative behaviours. For confined compression in one dimension, as considered here, any elasticity law can be written in the form \u03c3 \u2032 = \u03c3 \u2032(\u03c6f ). Thus, (2.7a,b) can be rewritten as a nonlinear advection\u2013diffusion equation:\n\u2202\u03c6f \u2202t + \u2202 \u2202x\n[ \u03c6f q \u2212 Df (\u03c6f )\u2202\u03c6f\n\u2202x\n] = 0 and \u2202q\n\u2202x = 0, (2.14a,b)\nwhere the nonlinear composite constitutive function\nDf (\u03c6f ) = (1 \u2212 \u03c6f )k(\u03c6f ) \u03bc\nd\u03c3 \u2032 d\u03c6f (2.15)\nis the poroelastic diffusivity. Hencky elasticity is a simple nonlinear hyperelasticity model that considers logarithmic strains (\u2018true strains\u2019 or \u2018Hencky strains\u2019) to capture kinematic nonlinearity (Hencky 1931), and which is commonly used to model soft rubbers and foams (Hencky 1933; Anand 1979; Xiao & Chen 2002) and sometimes for soft biological tissues (Marchesseau et al. 2010; Fraldi et al. 2019). Hencky elasticity is convenient for our present purposes because (i) it reduces to linear elasticity for small strains and (ii) it uses the same two elastic parameters as linear elasticity. It is straightforward to replace Hencky elasticity in the present formulation with a different elastic behaviour, such as a neo-Hookean model, as appropriate for the problem/material of interest. Neo-Hookean elasticity is commonly used as a simple model for soft tissues (e.g. Sengers et al. 2004; Ehlers, Karajan & Markert 2009); in the present context, we expect Hencky elasticity to provide a qualitatively similar mechanical response (see Appendix A).\nFor a uniaxial deformation, the relevant component of the effective stress tensor for Hencky elasticity is (MacMinn et al. 2016; Auton & MacMinn 2018)\n\u03c3 \u2032 = M ln(J) J\n= M (\n1 \u2212 \u03c6f 1 \u2212 \u03c6f ,0\n) ln ( 1 \u2212 \u03c6f ,0 1 \u2212 \u03c6f ) , (2.16)\nwhere M is the p-wave or oedometric modulus. With appropriate initial and boundary conditions, (2.14a,b), (2.15) and (2.16) form a closed model for the evolution of the porosity.\n2.7. Initial and boundary conditions Finally, we specify appropriate initial and boundary conditions for the solid skeleton and for the fluid. As noted previously, we locate the left and right boundaries of the solid at x = a(t) and x = L, respectively.\n2.7.1. Initial conditions Equation (2.1) suggests that a(0) = 0. The solid is therefore initially relaxed and the initial porosity is uniform and equal to the relaxed porosity,\nus(x, 0) = 0 and \u03c6f (x, 0) = \u03c6f ,0.

Left boundary For t > 0, we apply a displacement-controlled mechanical loading at the left boundary, which is therefore a moving boundary (see (2.1)). The associated boundary conditions are\nus(a, t) = a(t) and vs(a, t) = dadt . (2.18a)\nThe left boundary is also permeable, so we take\np(a, t) = 0. (2.18b)\n2.7.3. Right boundary The right boundary is impermeable and fixed in place, such that\nus(L, t) = vs(L, t) = vf (L, t) = 0. (2.19) This condition and the requirement that q be uniform in space (see the end of \u00a7 2.2 and (2.7a,b)) together imply that q \u2261 0, meaning that there is no net flow through any cross-section. Equation (2.8) then requires that\nvf = \u2212(1 \u2212 \u03c6f ) \u03c6f vs, (2.20)\nmeaning that the fluid and the solid always locally move in opposite directions.\n2.8. Linear poroelasticity For comparison with the fully nonlinear model, we linearise the relations given previously to arrive at linear poroelasticity, which is valid for infinitesimal deformations, (\u03c6f \u2212 \u03c6f ,0)/(1 \u2212 \u03c6f ,0) = \u2202us/\u2202x 1. In this limit, (2.7a,b) reduces to the linear-poroelastic diffusion equation,\n\u2202\u03c6f \u2202t \u2212 \u2202 \u2202x\n( Df ,0 \u2202\u03c6f\n\u2202x\n) \u2248 0, (2.21)\nwhere Hencky elasticity reduces to linear elasticity,\n\u03c3 \u2032 \u2248 M \u2202us \u2202x\n= M (\n\u03c6f \u2212 \u03c6f ,0 1 \u2212 \u03c6f ,0\n) , (2.22)\nand Df ,0 = k0M/\u03bc is the constant linear-poroelastic diffusivity. With appropriate initial and boundary conditions, (2.21) is a closed linear model for the evolution of the porosity.\nIn the linear poroelastic model, the initial conditions and the boundary conditions for the right boundary are again (2.17a,b) and (2.19), respectively. The linearised boundary conditions for the left boundary are\nus(0, t) \u2248 a(t) and vs(0, t) \u2248 dadt , (2.23a,b)\nwhere a(t) is again given by (2.1). Note that these conditions are linearised relative to (2.18) by virtue of being applied at x = 0 rather than at x = a(t).\n974 A2-7\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n74 7\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\n2.9. Scaling and summary We make the above problem dimensionless via the scaling\nx\u0303 = x L , u\u0303s = usL , t\u0303 = t Tpe , \u03c3\u0303 \u2032 = \u03c3\n\u2032\nM , p\u0303 = p M , k\u0303 = k(\u03c6) k0 , v\u0303f = vfL/Tpe , v\u0303s = vs L/Tpe ,\n(2.24a\u2013h)\nwhere Tpe = L2/Df ,0 = \u03bcL2/(k0M) is the classical poroelastic timescale, which is the characteristic diffusion time for the relaxation of pressure over a distance L.

We consider only dimensionless quantities in the following, dropping the tildes for convenience.\nThis one-dimensional model describes flow and mechanics in a poroelastic material subject to periodic loading. The kinematics are rigorous and nonlinear, the elasticity law is Hencky elasticity, and the permeability law is the Kozeny\u2013Carman relation. The full and linearised problems share the same three dimensionless control parameters: the dimensionless amplitude and period of the loading, A and T , and the relaxed porosity, \u03c6f ,0."

Average porosity We begin by deriving some basic kinematic results for the average porosity. The macroscopic total volume at any instant is 1 \u2212 a(t), whereas the total volume of solid is constant and equal to 1 \u2212 \u03c6f ,0. As a result, the total volume of fluid is \u03c6f ,0 \u2212 a(t) and the spatially averaged porosity is\n\u3008\u03c6f \u3009(t) = \u03c6f ,0 \u2212 a(t)1 \u2212 a(t) .

Note that both the spatial and overall averages are smaller than \u03c6f ,0 for a > 0 and A > 0 because the loading has a non-zero mean (i.e. a\u0304 = A/2 > 0), so the material is on average compressed.\n3.2. Linear poroelasticity: early time solution The linear problem posed in \u00a7 2.8 can be rewritten as a bounded linear diffusion problem for the displacement. When the loading begins, information about the motion of the left boundary propagates into the domain via poroelastic diffusion. At early times, before this information has had time to reach the right boundary, the response is the same as if the material were semi-infinite in the x direction. The corresponding semi-infinite diffusion problem involves applying the right boundary conditions at x \u2192 \u221e. This early time (\u2018et\u2019) solution can be derived via Laplace transform and written as a convolution integral,\nus,et(x, t) = \u03c0AT \u222b t 0 erfc ( x 2 \u221a \u03c4 ) sin [ 2\u03c0(t \u2212 \u03c4) T ] d\u03c4. (3.3)\nThe corresponding porosity field can be derived from (3.3) via (2.3), and is given by\n\u03c6f ,et(x, t) = \u03c6f ,0 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03c6f ,0)\u03c0AT \u222b t\n0\n1\u221a \u03c0\u03c4\nexp ( \u2212 x 2\n4\u03c4\n) sin [ 2\u03c0(t \u2212 \u03c4)\nT\n] d\u03c4. (3.4)\nThis solution is valid until the deformation spans the domain. Introducing the penetration length \u03b4et(t) as the distance from the left boundary over which the change in porosity has exceeded a threshold, the nature of the problem and the structure of the solution suggest that \u03b4et(t) \u223c 2 \u221a t. We confirm this reasoning in Appendix B. Thus, the above solution is valid for \u03b4et 1 \u2192 t 1/4. Having originated from linear poroelasticity, the above solution is limited to small deformations (A 1). Na\u00efvely, this solution is valid for any loading period T; however, sufficiently small values of T also violate the assumption of small deformations because deformation of size \u223c A are localised to a region of size \u223c \u03b4et(t) at early times. As a result, we expect the maximum strain near the left boundary to be roughly of size max[a(t)/\u03b4et(t)] \u223c A/ \u221a T . More precisely, (3.4) can be used to show that the extreme values of \u03c6f ,et will always occur at the left boundary and that the evolution of \u03c6f ,et at the\n974 A2-9\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n74 7\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nleft boundary is given by\n\u03c6f ,et(0, t) = \u03c6f ,0 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03c6f ,0)A \u221a \u03c0\nT I(t/T), (3.5)\nwhere I( y) = C(2\u221ay) sin(2\u03c0y) \u2212 S(2\u221ay) cos(2\u03c0y) (3.6) and C and S are the Fresnel cosine and sine integrals, respectively. The extreme values of \u03c6f ,et are then given by\nmin(\u03c6f ,et) = \u03c6f ,0 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03c6f ,0)A \u221a \u03c0\nT Imax, (3.7)\nand\nmax(\u03c6f ,et) = \u03c6f ,0 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03c6f ,0)A \u221a \u03c0\nT Imin, (3.8)\nwhere Imax = I(698/1909) \u2248 0.9491 and Imin = I(310/353) \u2248 \u22120.5406 are the maximum and minimum values of I, respectively. Strictly, the above solution is non-physical for parameter combinations for which the porosity decreases to 0 or increases to 1, corresponding to min(\u03c6f ,et) = 0 and max(\u03c6f ,et) = 1, respectively. In practice, these solutions become inaccurate for much less extreme parameter combinations as kinematic and constitutive nonlinearities become increasingly important. Hewitt et al. (2016) showed that very fast monotonic compression of a soft porous material can lead to extreme localisation near the piston in the form of a \u2018bloated\u2019 low-porosity boundary layer, the formation and evolution of which depends sensitively on the particular constitutive functions k(\u03c6f ) and \u03c3 \u2032(\u03c6f ). We avoid these extreme loading conditions in the present study, focusing instead on scenarios that are likely to have more biological relevance. The above results confirm that the maximum local strain is indeed of size A/ \u221a T , suggesting that the\nabove solution and the linear model in general are valid for A \u221aT . A similar condition can be derived by noting that, in the linear-poroelastic case, the boundary conditions at the left are applied at x = 0 rather than at x = a(t) (see (2.23a,b)). Thus, the validity of the linear-poroelastic model requires that the error in this linearisation, which is \u223c A, must be negligible relative to the poroelastic diffusion length associated with the deformation, which is \u223c \u221aT .\n3.3.

Also like the early time solution, this solution provides general insight into the poromechanical response of the system to periodic loading.

Going forward, we focus on this periodic regime. We show in Appendix C that the same reasoning also applies for large deformations.\n3.4. Linear poroelasticity: response to very fast loading (Stokes\u2019 second problem) As noted previously, the response at early times will be confined to a region of size \u223c \u221at, spreading diffusively until the entire domain is engaged, at which point the response will evolve exponentially toward its periodic regime. However, the oscillations in the periodic regime will be confined to a region of size \u223c \u221aT (or \u223c A if larger, but recall that linear poroelasticity requires that A \u221aT). Thus, if the period is sufficiently small (i.e. \u221a T 1), the material near the piston will oscillate while the far field exists in a state of static compression. This response to very fast loading is well known from Stokes\u2019s classical \u2018second problem\u2019, in which oscillations diffuse into a semi-infinite domain with an amplitude that decays exponentially in space, much like an evanescent wave.

This solution confirms that the oscillations will be increasingly localised near the piston as T decreases, featuring near-piston oscillations with an amplitude proportional to 1/ \u221a T that decay exponentially\nin space over a characteristic distance \u221a\nT . This solution is illustrated and discussed further in Appendix B.\n3.5. Response to very slow loading (quasi-static solution) In the full linear-poroelastic solution given previously, the porosity and displacement fields ((3.9) and (3.10)) converge to the quasi-static limits \u03c6f ,lpe(x, t) \u2192 \u03c6f ,0 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03c6f ,0)a(t) and us,lpe \u2192 a(t)(1 \u2212 x) as T \u2192 \u221e. This limit is a uniform state of strain in which poroelastic transients are fast relative to the loading period, and are therefore negligible. The fully nonlinear problem can be solved analytically in the same limit by taking \u2202\u03c6f /\u2202t \u2192 0. The resulting quasi-static (\u2018qs\u2019) solution is\nus,qs(x, t) = a(t)1 \u2212 a(t) (1 \u2212 x), (3.14)\n\u03c6f ,qs(t) = \u03c6f ,0 \u2212 a(t)1 \u2212 a(t) , (3.15)\nand\nvf ,qs(x, t) = \u2212 [\n1 \u2212 \u03c6f ,0 \u03c6f ,0 \u2212 a(t)\n] { 1 \u2212 x [1 \u2212 a(t)]2 } a\u0307(t). (3.16)\nThis solution is kinematically exact for arbitrarily large values of A, but is only valid for T 1. Note that this expression for \u03c6f ,qs is the same as that in (3.1) for \u3008\u03c6f \u3009(t) because the quasi-static porosity is spatially uniform and must therefore be equal to the average porosity.\n3.6. Scaling quantities In the absence of a net flow, fluid motion is directly related to changes in porosity. Hence, we present our solutions and results below in terms of the change in porosity with respect to the overall average porosity,\n\u03c6f \u2261 \u03c6f \u2212 \u3008\u03c6f \u3009.

We provide an example code in Fiori, Pramanik & MacMinn (2023). In figure 2, we illustrate the basic phenomenology of the response of a high-porosity material (\u03c6f ,0 = 0.75) to periodic loading at large amplitude (A = 0.2) and moderate period (T = 0.3\u03c0) for one cycle in the periodic regime.\nAll quantities considered, displacement, change in porosity, solid velocity, fluid velocity and effective stress, are largest in magnitude at the left boundary, where the material is forced, and smallest in magnitude at the right boundary, where the material is stationary, with a magnitude envelope that decreases monotonically from left to right. The displacement and both velocities vanish at the right boundary, as required. Note that these features depend greatly on the boundary conditions for both the solid and the fluid. The flow and deformation will focus toward boundaries where inflow and outflow are permitted, which here is the left-hand side. Reversing the permeability of the two boundaries (i.e. an impermeable moving boundary and a permeable fixed boundary) would instead focus the flow and deformation toward the right-hand side, roughly reversing the spatial profile of \u03c6f and producing a much more uniform profile of vf . However, the latter scenario is identical to the present one when viewed from a moving frame that follows the left boundary, x\u2032 = 1 + a(t) \u2212 x.\nFigure 2(e, f ) shows the effective stress normalised by the nominal strain at maximum compression, \u03c3 \u2032/A. The left column shows that the response is out of phase with the loading, with a phase shift that varies with the Lagrangian spatial coordinate X = x \u2212 us(x, t). For example, the stress at the left boundary leads the motion of the left boundary by about 0.15T (i.e. the moment of maximum |\u03c3 \u2032(a, t)| occurs about 0.15T before the moment of maximum a(t)), whereas the stress at the right boundary lags the motion of the left boundary by a similar amount. In addition, the material near the left boundary experiences strong compression during most of the loading phase (\u03c3 \u2032 < 0 for a\u0307 > 0) and mild tension during much of unloading (\u03c3 \u2032 > 0 for a\u0307 < 0). This hysteresis is highlighted by the large area enclosed by the loop in the phase portrait (right column), and it originates in the stronger relative role of viscous drag during moderate to fast loading.\n974 A2-13\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n74 7\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nMost of the features illustrated in figure 2 are qualitatively consistent with linear poroelasticity, although the quantitative accuracy of linear poroelasticity depends on the deformation parameters as discussed in the next section. A key qualitative feature introduced by nonlinearity is that the response during loading is not necessarily symmetric with the response during unloading. For example, the minimum values of \u03c6f (a, t) and vf (a, t) are much larger in magnitude than their maximum values and the stress loop is not symmetric about any axis. We explore this asymmetry in more detail in \u00a7 5.\n4.1. Comparison with analytical solutions We next compare the numerical solution to the linear-poroelastic and nonlinear quasi-static analytical solutions described in \u00a7 3, each of which is appropriate for a specific range of A and T .

We calculate these differences using \u03c6f (a, t) during one cycle in the periodic regime. In both figures, we plot these differences against T for several values of A (left panels) and then against A for several values of T (right panels).\nAs expected, figure 3 shows good agreement between the numerical and linear-poroelastic solutions for small deformations, worsening as A increases. The difference scales with A2 for a given value of T (right panel), as expected from linear poroelasticity, which is first order in strain.

Based on these results, we distinguish between \u2018slow loading\u2019 (SL; T \u03c0), where spatial variations in porosity are relatively small, and \u2018fast loading\u2019 (FL; T 0.1\u03c0), where spatial variations in porosity are relatively large. For very slow loading (T 1), the porosity is uniform and the response is quasi-static (see \u00a7 3.5).

            "text": "We next examine and compare the poroelastic response for SL and FL as a function of T , A and \u03c6f ,0. We focus on the evolution of us, \u03c6f and qf = \u03c6f vf in space and in time, and on the phase behaviour of \u03c3 \u2032(a, t). We conclude by considering the parameter ranges that would be relevant to various biological examples.\n5.1. Impact of loading period To visualise the distinct poromechanical responses for FL and SL, and the transition between them, we plot us, \u03c6f and qf (all normalised) over one cycle in the periodic regime for \u03c6f ,0 = 0.75, A = 0.1, and four different values of T: two for FL (left two columns) and two for SL (right two columns) (figure 5).\nFigure 5(a\u2013d) show that, for FL (i.e. T = 0.03\u03c0 and 0.1\u03c0), the displacement is highly nonlinear in X (and in x), with substantial differences between the loading and unloading phases. As T increases, transitioning into SL (i.e. T = 1\u03c0 and 10\u03c0), the displacement is increasingly linear in X and converges toward the quasi-static solution, which is fully determined by the instantaneous value of a and is thus symmetric between loading and unloading. For all values of T , the displacement is of characteristic size A at the left and vanishes at the right.\nFor SL, \u03c6f is uniform in space and varies only in time, per the quasi-static solution. The material is in a uniform state of compression, fully determined by the instantaneous value of a and thus symmetric between loading and unloading and fully relaxed at the beginning/end of each cycle. As T decreases, transitioning into FL, \u03c6f becomes increasingly localised near the left boundary and also increasingly asymmetric between loading and unloading (figure 5e). For FL, the material experiences a substantial amount of tension in the left portion of the domain during unloading, despite the overall mean compression. Tension emerges for FL because this regime is, by definition, one where the rate of loading is much faster than the poroelastic relaxation time, so the left boundary must pull the material to the left during unloading. The right portion of the domain experiences an overall more limited range of porosities and remains compressed throughout the cycle, never reaching a state of tension or even full unloading. The latter feature is also visible in the corresponding displacement fields.\nThe fluid flux qf = \u03c6f vf is particularly relevant to the transport of solutes since it drives advection. Fluid leaves the domain during the loading phase of the cycle (qf (x = a, t) = qf (X = 0, t) < 0 when a\u0307 > 0) and enters the domain during unloading. For SL, qf is entirely in phase with the loading, but opposite in sign. For FL, the peak value of qf in the\n974 A2-16\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n74 7\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\ninterior exhibits a lag relative to the peak value of a\u0307, and this lag increases with x. Note that the fluid flux is orders of magnitude larger for FL than for SL because the rate of loading is orders of magnitude faster, but this variation is largely scaled out by normalisation with q\u2217f (\u03c6f ,0, A, T) \u221d T\u22121, per (3.21) (figure 5i\u2013l).\n974 A2-17\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n74 7\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nThe extreme values of qf at the left boundary are larger in loading than in unloading, but progressively more symmetric as T increases. This asymmetry is a result of the kinematic and constitutive nonlinearity of large deformations. We show in Appendix E that this asymmetry originates in the nonlinear kinematics of large deformations, meaning that it emerges from the nonlinear model during large deformations even with linear elasticity and constant permeability. This asymmetry is then strongly amplified by deformation-dependent permeability (relative to constant permeability) and slightly suppressed by Hencky elasticity (relative to linear elasticity). The latter occurs because Hencky elasticity stiffens in compression, resulting in a larger poroelastic diffusivity and therefore weaker localisation during loading (see also Appendix A).\nThe asymmetry between loading and unloading is also highlighted by the evolution of \u03c3 \u2032(a, t) (figure 5m\u2013p). For FL, \u03c3 \u2032(a, t) exhibits hysteresis: for the same value of a(t), the value of \u03c3 \u2032(a, t) is considerably higher in magnitude during loading than during unloading (and tensile during much of the unloading phase). This hysteresis decreases as T increases, such that, for SL, \u03c3 \u2032(a, t) is modest in magnitude, fully compressive and symmetric between loading and unloading (i.e. non-hysteretic); as a result of the latter, the phase portrait for SL is a single curve (rather than a loop). These phase portraits also illustrate the convergence to the periodic regime: in all cases, the overall response grows less extreme as the transient component decays exponentially over the first \u223c T\u22121 cycles.\nSince a key difference between SL and FL is that the deformation is uniformly distributed in the former and localised toward the left in the latter, we study the emergence of this localisation to further quantify the transition from SL to FL. In figure 6, we plot the normalised maximum and minimum values of \u03c6f , qf and \u03c3 \u2032 at the left boundary (X = 0) and then either at the right boundary (X = 1) for \u03c6f and \u03c3 \u2032 or at the material mid-point (X = 1/2) for qf . The latter is necessary because qf vanishes at X = 1. We consider a range of periods T at two fixed values of A for \u03c6f ,0 = 0.75.\nFigure 6 shows that, for SL, the deformation is uniform, varying only in time. The maxima and minima of both \u03c6f and \u03c3 \u2032 remain separate, but their left and right values converge. The flux qf remains linear in space, even for SL (see \u00a7 3.5). As T decreases, the deformation is progressively localised at the left, such that the right is increasingly static. At the right, the maximum and minimum values of \u03c6f and qf converge to zero while the maximum and minimum values of \u03c3 \u2032 converge to weak compression, as also illustrated in figure 5.\nWe find that a small-amplitude deformation (A = 0.001) and a large-amplitude deformation (A = 0.1) exhibit qualitatively similar features. However, large deformations lead to an increasingly strong asymmetry between the maxima and minima of all quantities at the left boundary as T decreases. In particular, the curves are biased downward, such with higher magnitudes reached in loading (minima) than in unloading (maxima). This asymmetry is does not occur for small deformations, for which the maxima and minima of all quantities are symmetric in magnitude. Note also that the maxima of \u03c6f and \u03c3 \u2032 increase as T decreases for both values of A, whereas the maximum of qf is independent of T for small deformations but decreases with T for large deformations, consistent with figure 5.\n5.2. Impact of loading amplitude We next examine the impact of loading amplitude A on the poromechanical response. We first assess the interaction between amplitude and period by plotting \u03c6f against X at mid-cycle for two different values of T (one for SL and one for FL) and for five different values of A, ranging from small to large deformations (A = 0.002 to 0.2; figure 7). 974 A2-18\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n74 7\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\n974 A2-19\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n74 7\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nFigure 7(a) shows that, for SL, the non-normalised value of \u03c6f is uniform in X and increases with A, as expected. For FL, the non-normalised value of \u03c6f is increasingly non-uniform with X as A increases. Relative to the SL case, the deformation is increasingly amplified at the left boundary and suppressed at the right boundary (recall that the mean value of \u03c6f is independent of T). The right panel shows the same results, but now normalised by \u03c6Mf (3.18). By definition, all of the SL curves collapse onto \u03c6f / \u03c6 M f = \u22121 ( \u03c6Mf is the magnitude of the quasi-static change in porosity at mid-cycle). The FL curves also nearly collapse onto a master curve, suggesting that this normalisation scales out the leading-order impact of A, even for large deformations for FL. The largest deviations from this collapse are near the left boundary, where nonlinearities are particularly pronounced.\nIn figure 8, we focus on FL by fixing T = 0.1\u03c0 and plotting the evolution of \u03c6f , qf and \u03c3 \u2032(a, t) for three different values of A, ranging from small to large deformations.\nWe find that increasing A amplifies the asymmetry in the extreme values of \u03c6f and qf at the left boundary in loading and unloading, as noted in figure 6. The normalisation\n974 A2-20\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n74 7\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nscales out the leading-order impact of A on all of these quantities, as noted in figure 7; the non-normalised values of all three quantities would vary by two orders of magnitude across this range of A. As A increases, \u03c3 \u2032(a, t) exhibits more hysteresis and larger normalised magnitudes, in accordance with the amplified asymmetry.\nWe further explore the impact of A in figure 9 by plotting the normalised maxima and minima of \u03c6f , qf and \u03c3 \u2032 on the left and on the right, as in figure 6, but now against A for two different values of T , showing the smooth transition from small deformations (A 0.01) to large deformations (A 0.01). For small deformations, the normalised maxima and minima of all quantities at the left and at the right become independent of A, and the extreme values of \u03c6f and qf become symmetric. For SL, \u03c6f and \u03c3 \u2032 become uniform in space, such that their normalised left and right values are equal and depend only weakly on A for the largest deformations shown here (e.g. A 0.1). For FL, the values of all three quantities at the left become increasingly asymmetric and biased downward as A increases.\n5.3. Impact of initial porosity Finally, we consider the initial porosity \u03c6f ,0.

The right panel shows that normalisation by \u03c6Mf scales out the leading-order impact of varying \u03c6f ,0 on \u03c6f , again with small deviations at the left boundary for FL, when nonlinearities are most pronounced.\nWe next plot the evolution of \u03c6f and \u03c3 \u2032 in time for A = 0.01 and T = 0.1\u03c0 for the same three values of \u03c6f ,0 (figure 11), confirming that normalisation scales out the primary impact of \u03c6f ,0 on \u03c6f and on \u03c3 \u2032(a, t).\n5.4. FL in biological examples We conclude by considering appropriate parameter ranges for several examples of periodic loading in soft biological tissues (table 1). Based on these values, we calculate the poroelastic timescale Tpe and the relative dimensionless loading period T\u0303 = T/Tpe for each example to understand the ranges of relevance for A\u0303, T\u0303 and \u03c6f ,0.\nTable 1 indicates that, for a variety of soft tissues, deformations are in the range of the\ndimensionless amplitudes A\u0303 considered here, with nearly all being near the upper end. The range of \u03c6f ,0 is slightly wider than the range considered here, but we showed in \u00a7 5.3 that this value has little impact on the normalised mechanical response of the material. The range of poroelastic timescales Tpe and respective loading frequencies suggest that dimensionless loading periods T\u0303 span a wide range, with many corresponding to FL. These values justify our analysis and underscore the importance of characterising the nonlinearity of large poromechanical deformations during FL in particular.\n974 A2-22\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n74 7\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss"

            "text": "We have provided an analysis of the poromechanical coupling between large deformations and fluid flow in a periodically loaded soft porous material. To do so, we used a kinematically rigorous one-dimensional continuum model with Hencky elasticity and Kozeny\u2013Carman permeability. In particular, we examined the roles of the three dimensionless control parameters: the initial porosity \u03c6f ,0, the loading amplitude A and the loading period T .\nWe began by deriving several analytical solutions from linear poroelasticity, an early time solution, a full solution and a solution for the response to very fast loading (Stokes\u2019s second problem), as well as a quasi-static solution to the fully nonlinear problem. The former are valid for small deformations, which corresponds to A 1 and also, less obviously, to A \u221aT . The quasi-static solution is valid for very slow loading (T 1) but arbitrarily large amplitudes. We then compared these solutions with our numerical results, highlighting the existence of two mechanical regimes: slow loading (SL), where the loading is much slower than the poroelastic relaxation time Tpe, and fast loading (FL), where the loading is much faster than Tpe.\nWe then showed that the material response to SL (T \u03c0) is an increasingly uniform deformation throughout the domain, approaching the quasi-static solution for very slow loading. For FL (T 0.1\u03c0), the deformation is non-uniform and increasingly localised near the left boundary. In the limit of very fast loading, this localisation is such that the left portion of the material oscillates while the right portion is in a state of static compression. We showed that FL is also characterised by asymmetry between loading and unloading, with a larger change in porosity and higher fluid flux magnitudes during loading (when fluid is squeezed out) than during unloading (when fluid is sucked back in). This asymmetry originates in the kinematic nonlinearity of large deformations and\n974 A2-23\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n74 7\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nTy pi\nca ll\noa di ng Ti ss ue L (m ) A\u0303 = A / L \u03c6 f, 0 k 0 (m 2 ) M (P a) T p e (s ) fr eq ue nc y (H z)\nT\u0303 =\nT / T p\ne\nB ra\nin ex\ntr ac\nel lu\nla rm\nat ri x (K ed ar as et ti et al .2 02 0)\n2 \u00d7\n10 \u22124\n0. 1\u2013\n0. 2\n0. 2\n2 \u00d7\n10 \u22121\n5 2\n\u00d7 10\n3 \u22481\n0 0.\n3\u2013 10\n0. 00\n3\u03c0 \u20130\n.1 \u03c0\nC ar\ntil ag\ne (F\ner gu\nso n\net al\n.2 00\n4) 2\n\u00d7 10\n\u22123 \u22480\n.1 5\n0. 8\n7. 5\n\u00d7 10\n\u22121 8\n5 \u00d7\n10 6\n\u22481 02\n0. 00\n1\u2013 0.\n1 (s\nitt in g) 0. 1\u2013 1 (r un ni ng\n) 0.\n03 \u03c0\n\u20133 \u03c0\n0. 00\n3\u03c0 \u20130\n.0 3\u03c0\nIn te\nrv er\nte br\nal di\nsk (a\nnn ul\nus F. ) (F er gu so n et al .2 00\n4) 10\n\u22122 \u22480\n.1 5\n0. 7\n7. 5\n\u00d7 10\n\u22121 9\n2. 5\n\u00d7 10\n6 \u22485\n\u00d7 10\n4 2\n\u00d7 10\n\u22125 (w\nak e\ncy cl e) 0. 00 1\u2013 0. 1 (s itt in g)\n0. 1\u2013\n1 (r\nun ni\nng )\n0. 3\u03c0 6 \u00d7\n10 \u22125\n\u03c0 \u2013\n6 \u00d7\n10 \u22123\n\u03c0\n6 \u00d7\n10 \u22126\n\u03c0 \u2013\n6 \u00d7\n10 \u22125\n\u03c0\nC ar\ntil ag\ne sc\naf fo\nld (b\nio re\nac to r) (S en ge rs et al .2 00 4)\n2 \u00d7\n10 \u22123\n0\u2212 0.\n15 0.\n9 10\n\u22121 7\n10 5\n\u22484 \u00d7\n10 3\n0. 00\n1\u2013 1\n0. 00\n01 \u03c0\n\u20130 .1\n\u03c0\nTa bl\ne 1.\nM at\ner ia\nla nd\nlo ad\nin g\npa ra\nm et\ner s\nfo rs\nom e\nex am\npl es\nof bi\nol og\nic al\nm at\ner ia\nls .\n974 A2-24\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n74 7\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nis amplified by the localisation of the deformation near the left boundary as T decreases (itself a linear effect) and by the nonlinearity of deformation-dependent permeability as A increases. Thus, this asymmetry emerges from the fast and large deformation of an elastic and initially homogeneous material, and is therefore purely poromechanical; it does not occur during slow loading. Asymmetry between quasi-static loading and unloading can instead result from wall friction in confined geometries and/or constitutive hysteresis due to microstructural changes, as has been observed experimentally for some soft porous materials (e.g. Sobac, Colombani & Forterre 2011; Hewitt et al. 2016; Lutz, Wilen & Wettlaufer 2021).\nThrough the analysis on the fluid flow at different fixed material points in the domain, we also showed that faster loading leads to an increasing delay in the interior of the domain relative to the motion of the left boundary. Although the motion of the fluid itself is reversible, these features are likely to have an important impact on irreversible phenomena. For example, these results have interesting implications for the deformation-driven transport and mixing of solutes, which we consider in detail in a companion study.\nThe evolution of the stress at the left boundary as a function of the piston position revealed that, for faster loading and larger deformations, the force required to compress the material is much larger than the force required to pull it back. This asymmetry occurs because the viscous drag associated with outflow compresses the material against the outlet, reducing the permeability and resisting further fluid expulsion, whereas the viscous drag associated with inflow stretches the material away from the outlet, increasing the permeability and easing further fluid influx.\nFinally, we showed that a larger initial porosity \u03c6f ,0 leads to much lower fluid fluxes that can be accounted for by normalisation.\nOur results elucidate the local and global poromechanical behaviour of soft porous media during periodic loading over a wide range of \u03c6f ,0, A and T . Having used relatively generic constitutive models, we expect our qualitative insights to be robust across a wide range of materials; however, it is straightforward to adapt our approach to other constitutive models (see Appendix A).\nFunding.

            "text": "In our model, we consider Hencky elasticity as the constitutive law for the elastic solid. Hencky elasticity is a hyperelastic model commonly used for soft rubbers and polyurethane foams (Hencky 1933; Anand 1979; Xiao & Chen 2002), and sometimes for soft biological tissues (e.g. Marchesseau et al. 2010; Fraldi et al. 2019). In this appendix, we compare Hencky elasticity with two other hyperelastic models, neo-Hookean and logarithmic neo-Hookean, that are more commonly employed for soft tissues (e.g. Sengers et al. 2004; Ehlers et al. 2009). This analysis suggests that our qualitative results also apply to these other elasticity laws.\n974 A2-25\nht tp\ns: //\ndo i.o\nrg /1\n0. 10\n17 /jf\nm .2\n02 3.\n74 7\nPu bl\nis he\nd on\nlin e\nby C\nam br\nid ge\nU ni\nve rs\nity P\nre ss\nThe expressions \u03c3 \u2032(\u03c6f ) for Hencky elasticity and for linear elasticity are given in (2.16) and (2.22), respectively. The appropriate expressions for the neo-Hookean and logarithmic neo-Hookean constitutive laws are\n\u03c3 \u2032 = G (\nJ2 \u2212 1 J\n) + \u039b(J \u2212 1), (A1)\nand\n\u03c3 \u2032 = G (\nJ2 \u2212 1 J\n) + \u039b ln(J)\nJ , (A2)\nrespectively, where J = (1 \u2212 \u03c6f ,0)/(1 \u2212 \u03c6f ) and \u039b and G are the Lam\u00e9 constants, such that M = \u039b + 2G.\nFigure 12(a), we plot \u03c3 \u2032/M against \u03c6f in compression for all four of these elasticity laws (linear, Hencky, neo-Hookean and logarithmic neo-Hookean). Note that the two neo-Hookean models are characterised by an additional dimensionless parameter in confined compression, the ratio \u039b/G. All four curves have the same qualitative shape, although Hencky elasticity is noticeably stiffer than the other models during strong compression. However, these quantitative differences are relatively unimportant because the permeability law forces the poroelastic diffusivity smoothly toward zero during strong compression in all cases (see the following).\nFigure 12(b), we provide a similar comparison for two different permeability laws: Kozeny\u2013Carman (2.6) and a simpler power-law model given by\nk(\u03c6f ) = k0 ( \u03c6f\n\u03c6f ,0\n)3 . (A3)\nBoth models are commonly used for soft tissues and gels (e.g. Kozeny\u2013Carman in Malandrino et al. 2014; Sacco et al. 2014; Rahbari et al. 2017; Gao & Cho 2022 and power law in Holmes & Mow 1990; Ehlers et al. 2009; Sengers et al. 2004) and the two curves have qualitatively similar shapes. Note that constant permeability k(\u03c6f ) = k0 is rarely used for soft porous media and is considered non-physical, particularly for moderate to large deformations.\nFigure 12(c), we compare the resulting poroelastic diffusivity Df (\u03c6f ) (2.15) for all eight combinations of these four elasticity laws with these two permeability laws. Most of these curves have the same qualitative shape, most importantly vanishing smoothly as \u03c6f \u2192 0. The combination of Hencky elasticity with Kozeny\u2013Carman permeability (solid green line) is roughly in the middle of this family of curves, suggesting that this combination is representative of the poromechanical behaviour of many different soft porous materials, thus supporting the qualitative generality of our results."
