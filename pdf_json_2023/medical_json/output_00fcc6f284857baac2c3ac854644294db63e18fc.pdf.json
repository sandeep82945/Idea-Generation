    "abstractText": "Aiming at the problem of metro operation and passenger transport organization under the impact of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), a collaborative determination method of train planning and passenger flow control is proposed to reduce the train load rate in each section and decrease the risk of spreading COVID-19. The Fisher optimal division method is used to determine reasonable passenger flow control periods, and based on this, different flow control rates are adopted for each control period to reduce the difficulty of implementing flow control at stations. According to the actual operation and passenger flow changes, a mathematical optimization model is established. Epidemic prevention risk values (EPRVs) are defined based on the standing density criteria for trains to measure travel safety. The optimization objectives of the model are to minimize the EPRV of trains in each interval, the passenger waiting time and the operating cost of the corporation. The decision variables are the number of running trains during the study period and the flow control rate at each station. The original model is transformed into a single-objective model by the linear weighting of the target, and the model is solved by designing a particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm (PSO-GA). The validity of the method and the model is verified by actual metro line data. The results of the case study show that when a line is in the moderate-risk area of COVID-19, two more trains should be added to the full-length and short-turn routes after optimization. Combined with the flow control measures for large passenger flow stations, the maximum train load rate is reduced by 35.18%, and the load rate of each section of trains is less than 70%, which meets the requirements of COVID-19 prevention and control. The method can provide a theoretical basis for related research on ensuring the safety of metro operation during COVID-19.",

            "text": "With the spread and proliferation of the novel coronavirus (COVID-19), society as a whole has faced a broad-reaching and recurrent epidemic. To combat national epidemics, such as the COVID-19 outbreak, urban transportation should not only meet the requirements of dispatching emergency materials to medical treatment institutions in various disaster areas [1], but also meet the basic travel needs of urban residents and maintain the operation of cities. In the face of COVID-19, urban public transport (UPT) systems have the dual responsibility of ensuring effective transportation and hindering the spread of epidemics, but a region with great traffic accessibility means that the virus is also easy to reach its population [2\u20134]. The metro system plays an important role in the UPT system. However, due to its closed internal structure, dense passenger flow and strong mobility of people, it provides an extremely convenient environment for the spread of COVID-19 [5]. It\nSustainability 2023, 15, 1128. https://doi.org/10.3390/su15021128 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sustainability\nSustainability 2023, 15, 1128 2 of 17\nis important to study how to operate metro systems safely and efficiently under the impact of epidemic situations. The spread of COVID-19 in the metro system is related to factors such as the dynamic changes in the number of passengers, the average commuting time, the one-way operating time of trains, and the condition of disinfection and ventilation. Among them, the passenger density in a carriage has a substantial impact on the number of possible infections at the time of an outbreak, and the lower the load level is, the fewer the number of possible infections [6]. Therefore, in the case that the spatial structure and ventilation conditions of the metro system cannot be considerably improved, the virus transmission pathway can be cut off, and the exposure rate can be reduced by wearing masks and controlling the number of people entering the station and riding on the train, thus effectively reducing the probability of the spread of airborne infections [7]. At the operational level, corporations should pay attention to the changes in passenger flow on the line network, optimize the organization of train transportation, and cooperate with measures such as passenger flow control and inbound epidemic prevention detection. By guiding passengers to travel rationally, the exposure time and the total number of exposed passengers in the possible transmission range of the virus are minimized, aggregated transmission is avoided, and public travel safety is ensured [8]. In March 2020, China\u2019s Beijing Metro Corporation changed its original train timetable, and the Changping Line and Batong Line began to adopt the special train timetable with high demands under unusual conditions, such as epidemics; that is, to operate by increasing the number of running trains and routes, reducing the departure interval and the number of stops, etc., with the aim of reducing the load rate of metro trains during COVID-19 [9] and gradually increasing the number of lines using the special train timetable to 13 in the following month. Based on the prevention and control idea of \u201csource control-prevention-tracking-disposal\u201d, China\u2019s Wuhan metro operator designed a passenger flow control implementation plan during COVID-19, formulated quantitative indicators and assessed each link of passenger flow control individually in combination with qualitative analysis. After practical verification, all indicators meet the requirements of epidemic prevention, which can ensure a high level of operation service and has certain reference value for the operation of metros in other epidemic risk areas [10]. In the face of the impact of COVID-19, it is necessary to adjust the operation organization to reduce the load rate of metro trains, considering the interests of both passengers and corporations. At present, the existing epidemic prevention academic results of urban rail transit are all special operation diagrams designed for their own conditions by metro in COVID-19 risk places. Research on train plans and passenger flow control is mostly based on the normal environment, and there are few related studies on the impact of epidemic situations as a reference from theoretical aspects, such as models. Based on the above problems, this paper considers the requirements of metro COVID-19 prevention and control and proposes a collaborative determination method of metro train plan adjustment and passenger flow control, aiming to meet the travel demand while ensuring travel safety, improve the scientificity, accuracy and effectiveness of COVID-19 prevention, and provide a method reference for metro operation during the epidemic. The model and method are also applicable to other major public health events. To build the groundwork for the contributions of this paper, a literature review is provided in Section 1.2."

In response to the impact of COVID-19 on the transportation industry, many scholars in the industry have conducted studies on issues in their fields. Hamidi et al. modeled the cumulative COVID-19 per capita infection rate in New York City using spatial lag models, found that crowding and average household size can greatly influence the spread of the virus, and suggested that policymakers should pay particular attention to neighborhoods with a high proportion of crowded households\nSustainability 2023, 15, 1128 3 of 17\nand these destinations during the early stages of pandemics [11]. Zhou et al. developed a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR)-based model to simulate the spread of infectious diseases in the Tianyi metro station in Ningbo, China, performed sensitivity analysis on the parameters of the model and found that a higher contact rate, infectivity, and average illness duration were associated with higher numbers of infections [12]. Jin et al. constructed a PageRank algorithm-based risk model to accurately identify the key nodes of epidemic prevention and control in subway space, and the results of the case study showed that high-risk level spatial nodes are identified, including stairs, escalators, and platform transfers, which need to be focused on [13]. Seong et al. evaluated the correlations between subway use density and the activity of the influenza epidemic or COVID-19 pandemic using a time-series regression method [14]. Zhang et al. used a Bayesian network model to evaluate the operation risk of Chongqing Rail Transit in China under COVID-19 and constructed a risk assessment system based on the indicators of business risk, emergency management risk, passenger risk and public safety management risk [15]. Yang et al. studied the optimization of cold-chain emergency material distribution routes under COVID-19 and proposed a multidimensional robust optimization model to solve the problem of dispatching materials to medical treatment institutions in various disaster areas [16]. During COVID-19, by exploring the spatial and temporal distribution of passenger flow in metro networks, adjusting train operation plans, optimizing the allocation of line resources, and achieving accurate matching of capacity and traffic volume, a passenger flow control strategy is adopted to reduce the load of stations with high demand and better manage large passenger flow during peak hours to reduce the full load rate of the trains and ensure the safety of metro operation. For train operation plan optimization research, Deng et al. established a multiobjective bilevel programming model based on the passenger travel elastic demand function [17]. Zhang et al. analyzed the optimal train operation plan under different train types, train routing and stop modes [18]. Wang et al. established an optimization model with the objective of minimizing the total passenger waiting time and the transportation cost of corporations and with the constraints of the maximum number of available vehicles, train tracking interval and passenger demand [19]. Liu et al. established a model of long and short routing operation plans based on the cycle analysis method of train working diagrams, with the goal of minimizing the total cost converted from each cost. The actual case shows that the method has a good optimization effect on the radius line [20]. Zhang et al. developed a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) model for train scheduling, where short turning train services and full-length train services are optimized based on the predefined headway obtained by passenger demand analysis [21]. Li et al. proposed a nonuniform departure method to balance the load of full-length and short turning trains and established a mathematical model with the goal of minimizing passenger waiting time and corporation operating costs. A two-stage genetic algorithm was designed to solve the problem [22]. Li et al. established an optimization model for multirouting and multigrouping metro lines and generated alternative routing sets through the location of turn-back stations. Considering the factors that passengers choose to take trains with different routings, they optimized the train routing, marshalling number and operation logarithm in the train diagram [23]. Ma et al. constructed an emergency customized bus route optimization method considering epidemic prevention and control requirements under public health emergencies, and the number of operating vehicles and operating hours were increased after optimization, which is useful for metro operations [24]. In passenger flow control research, Jiang et al. studied the congestion of metro platform stairs during peak hours and developed specific measures to control passenger flow and ease congestion [25]. Lu et al. predicted origin-destination (OD) passenger flow based on the idea of flow on the path so that it can play a good role in passenger flow warning [26]. Xu et al. analyzed passenger flow line metro stations, established a path selection model, and carried out corresponding control measures for passenger flow based\nSustainability 2023, 15, 1128 4 of 17\non the threshold of facilities and equipment [27]. Guo et al. analyzed the inflow passenger flow of public transport stations with capacity constraints and adopted coordinated control measures among stations [28]. Li et al. considered the timetable and passenger flow control strategy of high traffic density metro lines and carried out the optimal control of passengers according to the characteristics of the timetable [29]. Xu et al. analyzed the dynamic change process of inbound and transfer passenger flows, established a multistation cooperative passenger flow control model, and used a logit model to describe the route choice behavior of passengers [30]. Xue et al. divided stations into four areas: platform, paid zone, nonpaid zone, and station entrance. According to the train capacity and number of people stuck on a platform, a three-level passenger flow control model was established to solve the optimal strategy for controlling the number of people in each area [31]. Liu et al. proposed a passenger flow control strategy based on queuing theory and simulated the congestion propagation between service facilities in a station through Simulink. The optimization goal is to minimize passenger delay time and corporation operating costs [32]. It is important to note that in urban rail transit passenger transportation organization problems, simply optimizing the train plan to meet passenger demand will encounter a bottleneck when the capacity reaches the upper limit, and simply taking a passenger flow control strategy to accommodate the transport capacity will reduce the service level to passengers. At the same time, metro operation under the impact of COVID-19 is still a new research field, and systematic research focusing on safety prevention and control in the context of COVID-19 is not yet complete. Therefore, this paper constructs a collaborative optimization model of train plans and passenger flow control under the impact of COVID19, fully considers the influence of COVID-19 prevention and control in the objective function of the model, and studies the integrated method of train plans and passenger flow control, which is of great significance to metro operation organization under the influence of public health emergencies. The structure of the rest of this paper is as follows: Section 2 describes the metro operation organization problem from the two aspects of the train plan and passenger flow control. Section 3 constructs metro train plan adjustment and passenger flow control mathematical models to reduce the risk of epidemic transmission. Section 4 introduces the method of model processing and the algorithm design of model solving. Section 5 presents the case analysis. Section 6 provides a discussion of the study.

The origin and destination points of companies, schools and homes are relatively fixed, and the OD structure of the lines during this time period can be considered to be relatively stable, i.e., passengers will not choose to take other modes of transportation or change their choice of departure and destination stations due to the adoption of passenger flow control measures. (2) The train departure interval, interval running duration and stopping duration are in accordance with the pre-determined timetable, without considering the occurrence of late and delay due to unexpected events. In actual operation, the punctuality of urban rail transit trains is extremely high in the absence of breakdowns, which can be assumed to operate strictly according to the train timetable. (3) Simplifying the process of passenger entry and exit. The model considers the transportation organization optimization strategy mainly at the line level and therefore ignores the influence of the station infrastructure, i.e., passengers passing through the inbound entrance can reach the station platform directly after the restricted flow, and since the exiting passengers eventually leave the metro station, which can reduce metro passenger congestion, it is assumed that all exiting passengers can leave the rail station smoothly without accumulating in the station.\nLet the set of all stations of the metro line be S = {1, 2, . . . , n}, and the indices are s and u.

Therefore, the epidemic prevention risk value (EPRV) is defined to measure the safety of passenger travel under the impact of COVID-19. When there is no one standing in a carriage and all passengers have seats, the EPRV is 0, indicating that passenger safety is fully guaranteed, and the probability of COVID-19 spreading in the carriage is minimal. Additionally, when the standing density is greater than six people per square meter, the EPRV is 1, indicating a complete failure to meet the requirements of COVID-19 prevention and control, and passengers traveling on the metro cannot be guaranteed to be safe. The specific calculation expression of EPRV is as follows:\nRis\u2032 =  0, cis\u2032 \u2264 bC0 cis\u2032 \u2212 bC0 bC \u2212 bC0 bC0 < cis\u2032 \u2264 bC 1, cis\u2032 > bC\n(13)\nwhere Ris\u2032 is the EPRV of train i in interval s\u2032; b is the number of train formations; C0 is the number of seats in carriages; and C is the personnel quota of the train. To reduce the possibility of COVID-19 spread, the EPRV of trains running in each interval of the line should be reduced as much as possible. The objective function is as follows:\nminZ1 = \u2211 i\u2208I\nn\u22121 \u2211\ns\u2032=1 Ris\u2032/(n\u2212 1) (14)\nwhere Z1 is the average risk level of COVID-19 spread in intervals.\n(2) Minimizing passenger waiting time\nThe passenger waiting time includes the waiting time for the train and the detention time at the passenger flow control place, which is calculated separately for full-length and short turning route sections. The expressions of the objective function are as follows:\nZ21 = \u2211 i\u2208I1\n[ s0\u22121\n\u2211 s=1\n( xis \u00b7 \u2206t1 + qInis \u00b7 \u2206t1 2 ) + n\n\u2211 s=s1+1\n( xis \u00b7 \u2206t1 + qInis \u00b7 \u2206t1 2 )] (15)\nZ22 = \u2211 i\u2208I2\n[ s1\n\u2211 s=s0\n( xis \u00b7 \u2206t2 + qInis \u00b7 \u2206t2 2 )] (16)\nminZ2 = Z21 + Z22 (17)\nwhere Z21 and Z22 are the passenger waiting times for full-length route and short turning route sections, respectively; \u2206t1 and \u2206t2 are departure intervals for one full-length route and short turning route sections, respectively; and Z2 is the total waiting time for passengers.\n(3) Minimizing corporation operating costs\nCorporation operating costs include train running costs and labor costs, with the train running kilometers and operating time. The objective function expression is as follows:\nminZ3 = g \u00b7 2\n\u2211 y=1\nJy \u00b7 ly + h \u00b7 2\n\u2211 y=1 Jy \u00b7 \u03b8y (18)\nwhere Z3 is the operating cost of the corporation; g is the unit cost of train running kilometers; ly is the length of train routes; h is the unit time cost of labor; and \u03b8y is the operation time of train routes."

            "text": "(1) Considering the problem of metro passenger transportation and organization under the influence of COVID-19, a collaborative determination method of metro train plan adjustment and passenger flow control is proposed. According to the actual operation and the dynamic change in passenger flow, a mathematical optimization model is established. The epidemic prevention risk value is defined to measure the safety degree of the train in each interval. The minimum epidemic prevention risk value is taken as one of the optimization objectives of the model. The other two optimization objectives are the minimum passenger waiting time and the minimum operating cost of the corporation.\nSustainability 2023, 15, 1128 16 of 17\n(2) The research period division scheme is formulated by the Fisher optimal division method, and the results are used as the basis for solving the model. PSO-GA is designed to solve the model. The chromosome crossover and mutation operations in the genetic algorithm are integrated into the iterative process of particle swarm optimization to improve the solution efficiency. (3) The validity of the model and algorithm is verified by the case of Qingdao Metro Line 1 in China. The results show that when the line is in the risk area of COVID-19, two trains with full-length and short turning routes should be added after optimization, and the stations with high passenger demand adopt different flow control rates in various control periods. The combination of the two can alter the load rate of trains in each interval by less than 70%, effectively reduce the personnel density in carriages, reduce the risk of COVID-19 spread and cluster infection, and control the increase in passenger waiting time and enterprise operation cost in the whole line at an acceptable level.\nAuthor Contributions: Methodology, J.L.; Data curation, H.T.; Writing\u2014original draft, J.L.; Supervision, F.P., C.M., L.Z. and X.Y.
