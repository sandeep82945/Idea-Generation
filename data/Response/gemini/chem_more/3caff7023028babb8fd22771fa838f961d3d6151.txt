1. **Investigate the relationship between specific functional groups and the severity of ADRs.** This could help clinicians identify drugs that are more likely to cause severe ADRs and make more informed decisions about prescribing them.
2. **Explore the role of structural groups in the development of ADRs.** This could help scientists develop new drugs that are less likely to cause ADRs.
3. **Examine the relationship between the chemical structure of drugs and their efficacy.** This could help clinicians identify drugs that are more likely to be effective for specific conditions.
4. **Develop a predictive model to identify drugs that are likely to cause ADRs.** This could help clinicians make more informed decisions about prescribing drugs and reduce the risk of ADRs.
5. **Conduct a clinical trial to evaluate the effectiveness of using chemical structure to predict ADRs.** This would provide definitive evidence of the utility of this approach.
