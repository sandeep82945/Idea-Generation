Bosonic code spaces, where single-photon loss represents the dominant source of error, are promising candidates for AQEC due to their flexibility and controllability. While existing proposals have demonstrated the in-principle feasibility of AQEC with bosonic code spaces, these schemes are typically based on the exact implementation of the Knill-Laflamme conditions and thus require the realization of Hamiltonian distances d \u2265 2. Implementing such Hamiltonian distances requires multiple nonlinear interactions and control fields, rendering these schemes experimentally challenging. Here, we propose a bosonic code for approximate AQEC by relaxing the Knill-Laflamme conditions. Using reinforcement learning (RL), we identify the optimal bosonic set of codewords (denoted here by RL code), which, surprisingly, is composed of the Fock states |2\u3009 and |4\u3009. As we show, the RL code, despite its approximate nature, successfully suppresses single-photon loss, reducing it to an effective dephasing process that well surpasses the break-even threshold. It may thus provide a valuable building block toward full error protection. The error-correcting Hamiltonian, which includes ancilla systems that emulate the engineered dissipation, is entirely based on the Hamiltonian distance d = 1, significantly reducing model complexity. Single-qubit gates are implemented in the RL code with a maximum distance dg = 2.\nIntroduction.\u2014Implementing efficient quantum error correction (QEC) is a prerequisite and the main obstacle toward building a general-purpose quantum computer [1\u2013 3]. The purpose of QEC is to restore encoded quantum information that has been corrupted by environmental noise: physical qubits inevitably interact with the surrounding environment [4, 5]. In conventional QEC this is achieved by error syndrome measurements and adaptive recovery operations, which involve imperfect measurements and classical feedback loops that themselves raise and propagate errors [6\u201314].\nAutonomous quantum error correction (AQEC) has been developed as an alternative that avoids these additional error sources by realizing QEC through quantum reservoir engineering, where the cleverly designed and continuously acting dissipation processes replace the repeated measurement-feedback cycles [15\u201319]. More specifically, the interaction between the to-be-protected system and an ancilla system is engineered to transport the decoherence-induced, cumulative entropy from the system to the ancilla, from where it decays into the environment [20\u201328].\nThe realization of AQEC in bosonic systems is particularly attractive, as an infinitely large Hilbert space offers ample design opportunities while the noise channels remain fixed. Indeed, several pioneering works have demonstrated the great potential of AQEC to counteract single-photon loss, the dominant error source in bosonic systems; for instance, based on the T4C code [15], the binomial code [29], or the \u221a 3 code [30]. While these\ncodewords fully satisfy the Knill-Laflamme (KL) con-\nditions, and hence in principle allow for exact AQEC [31, 32], experimental limitations have so far prohibited their faithful implementation. Therefore, the experimental surpassing of the break-even threshold (i.e, improved performance compared to codewords consisting of the Fock states |0\u3009 and |1\u3009 and no error correction) using AQEC is still lacking.\nRigorous implementation of the KL condition unavoidably implies codewords that entail complex and fragile superpositions of Fock states, which are hard to produce. This is reflected by the required Hamiltonian distance, i.e., the number of Fock states that must be bridged by the Hamiltonian. Indeed, an exhaustive search has excluded the existence of a code space that both rigorously satisfies the KL condition and is content with Hamiltonian distance d = 1 for AQEC [30]. On the other hand, the larger the Hamiltonian distance, the more high-order interactions are required, accompanied by an increasing number of control fields. The experimental hardness is further aggravated by the necessity to implement gates, which typically require even larger Hamiltonian distances.\nHere, we pursue a different strategy, following the spirit of approximate QEC [33\u201337]. By relaxing the KL condition, we strive to ease the experimental overhead by lowering the Hamiltonian distance as much as possible. While this excludes the in-principle exact QEC, we consider our strategy successful, if the discovered AQEC surpasses the break-even threshold, i.e., if the encoded qubit outperforms the natural qubit and thus lowers the threshold for a concatenated QEC stack.\n2 The search for the optimal approximate AQEC scheme that achieves this involves a complex optimization problem, which we solve with the help of reinforcement learning (RL) [38\u201348]. We find that the optimal AQEC scheme relies on surprisingly simple codewords (denoted here by RL code) composed of the two Fock states |2\u3009 and |4\u3009. The RL code not only significantly surpasses the breakeven with an infidelity reduction of over 80% (surprisingly even outperforming the \u221a 3 code), but also can be\nrealized with the smallest possible Hamiltonian distance d = 1; the respective Hamiltonian distance required to implement single-qubit gates is dg = 2, which again outperforms all previously proposed code spaces.\nWe demonstrate that the approximate AQEC based on the RL code can be realized by complementing the encoded bosonic mode with an ancillary lossy mode, an ancillary lossy two-level system, and couplings that are readily available on existing platforms.\nApproximate AQEC.\u2014 AQEC employs engineered dissipation to recover from the errors that occur due to natural decay processes. In brief, engineered Lindblad operators \u2211\nk D[Leng,k] are introduced such that the overall dissipative channel M[\u00b7], which also includes the natural Lindblad operators \u2211\niD[Lnat,i], minimizes the growth of the infidelity between an arbitrary qubit state \u03c1t0(\u03b8, \u03c6) = |\u03c8\u03b8\u03c6\u3009\u3008\u03c8\u03b8\u03c6| in the code space and the evolved state \u03c1t(\u03b8, \u03c6) = M[\u03c1t0(\u03b8, \u03c6)]. This happens by enlarging the effect of \u2211\nk D[Leng,k] [49], where D[x] = 2x\u03c1x\u2020 \u2212 x\u2020x\u03c1\u2212 \u03c1x\u2020x, and the angles \u03b8 and \u03c6 parametrize an arbitrary qubit state in the Bloch-sphere representation.\nThe mean fidelity F\u0304 (|0L\u3009, |1L\u3009), and hence the performance of the AQEC, depends on the choice of the logical codewords |0L\u3009 and |1L\u3009. If the logical codewords satisfy the KL condition [32],\n\u3008uL|L\u2020nat,jLnat,i|vL\u3009 = \u03b1ji\u03b4uv, u, v \u2208 {0, 1}, (1)\nwhere \u03b1ji are the elements of a Hermitian matrix, one can, in principle, achieve exact QEC. However, in the context of AQEC for bosonic codes, where Lnat,i \u2208 {I, a} [50\u201352], the exact implementation of the KL conditions can be challenging. For instance, the necessity to engineer multiple Lindblad operators, as is the case with the binomial and the T4C code, dramatically increases experimental complexity. A similar challenge occurs if multiple high-order nonlinear interactions, along with multiple control fields, are required, as for the \u221a 3 code.\nIt has been shown that approximate QEC (i.e., the codewords partially satisfy the KL condition) can combine experimental feasibility with good QEC performance [53\u201356]. Following this line of research, we relax the KL condition by discarding the constraint that \u30081L|L\u2020nat,iLnat,i|1L\u3009 = \u30080L|L \u2020 nat,iLnat,i|0L\u3009, i.e., we allow the logical code words to exhibit different error probabilities. General codewords (selecting the even subspace) that satisfy the remaining KL conditions can then be\nparametrized as\n|0L\u3009 = \u2211\nn=0\nc(0)n |4n\u3009, |1L\u3009 = \u2211\nn=0\nc(1)n |4n+ 2\u3009, (2)\nwhere the c (0) n and c (1) n denote undetermined real coefficients and satisfy \u2211\nn |c (u) n |2 = 1 (u = 0, 1). Our goal\nis now to find coefficients c (0) n and c (1) n that optimize the performance of the corresponding AQEC with only a single, fixed QEC jump operator,\nLeng = Lo { Tr [ L\u2020oLo ]}\u22121/2 ,\nLo = |0L\u3009\u30080er|+ |1L\u3009\u30081er|, (3)\nwhere |uer\u3009 = a|uL\u3009/\u03beu (u = 0, 1) denotes the basis of the error space and \u03beu = \u221a\n\u3008uL|a\u2020a|uL\u3009 is the normalization coefficient. The QEC jump operator Leng steers the encoded quantum state from the error space back into the code space and can be expanded as\nLeng = \u2211\n|dl|\u2264d\n\u2211\nn\n\u03bbndl |n\u3009\u3008n+ dl|, (4)\nwhere d is the Hamiltonian distance. We can model the engineered dissipation through a\nsystem-environment interaction by introducing a lossy auxiliary qubit and the coupling Heff = g(Leng\u03c3+ + L\u2020eng\u03c3\u2212), which results in the engineered Lindblad superoperator D[Leng] when the qubit is traced out. The evolution of the whole system is then governed by the master equation (~ = 1)\nd\u03c1 dt = \u2212i[Heff, \u03c1] + \u03b3a 2 D[a] + \u03b3b 2 D[\u03c3\u2212], (5)\nwhere \u03b3a denotes the single-photon loss rate of mode a and \u03b3b denotes the decay rate of the auxiliary qubit. We assume that the parameters satisfy \u03b3a, g \u226a \u03b3b and \u03b3a \u226a g, which promotes the unidirectional transition from the error space to the code space effected by L\u2020eng. As shown in Fig. 1(a), the recovery process is then as follows: |\u03c8\u03b8\u03c6, 0\u3009 \u03b3a\u2212\u2192 |\u03c8er\u03b8\u03c6, 0\u3009 g\u2212\u2192 |\u03c8\u03b8\u03c6, 1\u3009 \u03b3b\u2212\u2192 |\u03c8\u03b8\u03c6, 0\u3009 and |\u03c8\u03b8\u03c6, 0\u3009 \u03b3a\u2212\u2192 |\u03c8er\u03b8\u03c6, 0\u3009 g\u2212\u2192 |\u03c8\u03b8\u03c6, 1\u3009 \u03b3a\u2212\u2192 |\u03c8er\u03b8\u03c6, 1\u3009\n\u03b3b\u2212\u2192 |\u03c8er\u03b8\u03c6, 0\u3009 g\u2212\u2192 |\u03c8\u03b8\u03c6, 1\u3009 \u03b3b\u2212\u2192 |\u03c8\u03b8\u03c6, 0\u3009. That is, when an error occurs, the system returns to the logical state |\u03c8\u03b8\u03c6, 0\u3009 by transitioning through one out of two possible error correction cycles. Optimal code space.\u2014Finding the optimal coefficients c (0) n and c (1) n , such that the codewords (2) maximize the mean fidelity F\u0304 (|0L\u3009, |1L\u3009), at some fixed reference time, represents a complex optimization problem that we solve using reinforcement learning (RL). In brief, each episode is divided into a finite number of steps k = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,K. As shown in Fig. 1(b), at each step k, the agent observes the current state sk \u2208 S, and chooses an action ak \u2208 A according to the policy \u03c0(A|S). The action corresponds\nto a coefficient vector [c (0) n , c (1) n ], and the state is described by the fidelity F (\u03b8, \u03c6, t) = Tr[\u03c1t0(\u03b8, \u03c6)\u03c1t(\u03b8, \u03c6)], with \u03b8 \u2208 {0, \u03c0/2, \u03c0} and \u03c6 \u2208 {0, \u03c0/2, \u03c0, 3\u03c0/2}. After each action, the agent receives a reward rk+1 and arrives at a new state sk+1, where the reward rk is set to maximize the difference between the mean fidelity of the logical space and the break-even point. State and reward are obtained by simulating the master equation (5) until \u03b3at = 0.6 with QuTiP [57, 58], where the parameters g/\u03b3a = 400, \u03b3b/\u03b3a = 1750 are chosen to maximize the cooperativity C = g2/\u03b3a\u03b3b \u2248 91.4, while remaining experimentally realistic. The states and rewards collected during the sampling process are fed back to the proximal policy optimization algorithm to update the policy \u03c0(A|S) [59], which is achieved by Ray [60] (See Supplementary Materials for the more information [61]).\nThe optimal code basis found by the RL algorithm, delivering a mean fidelity \u2248 0.95 at \u03b3at = 0.6 and thus significantly exceeding the break-even point at \u2248 0.84, consists of the Fock states: |0L\u3009 \u2248 |4\u3009 and |1L\u3009 \u2248 |2\u3009, i.e., c (0) 1 \u2248 1, c (1) 0 \u2248 1, c (0) 0 \u2248 c (1) 1 \u2248 0 [Note that we truncated the code space at 6 photons. Moreover, we stress that different optimization times \u03b3at yield consistent outcomes, cf. Fig. 1(c)]. These simple code words can be conveniently prepared in existing experimental setups, e.g., superconducting quantum systems [63\u201367]. Moreover, the respective QEC jump operator Leng \u221d |2\u3009\u30081|+ |4\u3009\u30083| has the shortest possible Hamiltonian distance d = 1, implying that the QEC Hamiltonian can be efficiently implemented without the need for multiple nonlinear interactions and control fields [15, 30]. The Hamiltonian distance of the codewords is 2, resulting in single-qubit gates with dg = 2. For instance, the logical Pauli operators are im-\nplemented as \u03c3x = |2\u3009\u30084|+ |4\u3009\u30082|, \u03c3y = i(|4\u3009\u30082| \u2212 |2\u3009\u30084|), and \u03c3z = |2\u3009\u30082| \u2212 |4\u3009\u30084|. For comparison, the lowestorder binomial code requires dg = 4 and the \u221a 3 code dg = 6. Consequently, single-qubit gates in the RL code space only require second-order nonlinearity, instead of the fourth-order or sixth-order nonlinearities of previous proposals.\nIn Fig. 1(c), we compare the mean fidelities of the RL code, \u221a 3 code, and the lowest-order binomial code, where\neach code is complemented by a single QEC jump operator Eq. (3). We find that the RL code surpasses breakeven and both other codes, with the performance advantage growing in time. The mean fidelity of the RL code exceeds the break-even point by \u2248 36% at \u03b3at = 4. Note that there is a short transition period where the\nRL code performs poorer than the other codes. This is because initially, when the system lives entirely in the code space, the jump operator Eq. (3) is not yet effective and the dynamics is entirely driven by the detrimental single-photon loss [68]. The associated decay rate is proportional to the mean photon number, which is highest for the RL code in our comparison (n\u0304 = 3 for the RL code, compared to n\u0304 = 2 for the binomial code, n\u0304 = \u221a 3 for the \u221a 3 code, and n\u0304 = 0.5 for the break-\neven code). Only after this transition period the jump operator Eq. (3) becomes effective and the RL code can unfold its performance advantage over the other codes. Note that the dip at the onset of the transition period reflects the reversible fraction of the fidelity loss and can be removed by using a quantum trajectory-resolved and temporally coarse-grained fidelity F \u2217\u03c4 (t) [61, 68].\nTo demonstrate that the AQEC can efficiently protect all quantum states in the RL code space, we evaluate\n4 in Fig. 1(d) the fidelity F (\u03b8, \u03c6, t) at t = 0.6/\u03b3a, where \u03b8 and \u03c6 are the Bloch-sphere angles. We find that the fidelity remains for all states within the range [0.93, 1], well above the break-even point 0.84.\nProtection of the logical qubit\u2014To better understand the level of protection provided by our AQEC scheme, we solve the master equation in the limit \u03b3a, g \u226a \u03b3b and g2/(\u03b3a\u03b3b) \u226b 1 (a detailed derivation can be found in the Supplemental Material [61]). The approximate solution, after tracing out the auxiliary qubit and expressed in terms of the first five Fock states, reads\n\u03c1a(t) \u2248\n\n    \n0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u03c122(0) 0 \u03c124(0)e \u2212u\u03b3at 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u03c142(0)e \u2212u\u03b3at 0 \u03c144(0)\n\n     , (6)\nwith the initial state elements \u03c1ij(0). The effective protection factor u = 3\u2212 2 \u221a 2 \u2248 0.17 captures the reduction of the residual dephasing rate compared to the |0\u3009 and |1\u3009 encoding. The resulting mean fidelity is upper bounded by\nF\u0304 (t) = 2\n3 +\n1 3 exp(\u2212u\u03b3at), u = 3\u2212 2\n\u221a 2 \u2248 0.17, (7)\nand thus clearly outperforms the mean fidelity of the break-even\nF\u0304be(t) = 1\n6\n[\nexp (\u2212\u03b3at) + 2 exp (\u2212 \u03b3at\n2 ) + 3\n]\n. (8)\nWe infer from Eq. (7) that, if the cooperativity C is large enough, the performance of AQEC depends only on the evaluation time \u03b3at. If we choose \u03b3at = 0.17 (e.g., \u03b3a = 0.1 kHz, t = 1.7 ms), the mean fidelity is 99.05%, which significantly surpasses the break-even point (94.68%). The infidelity reduction of the RL code compared to the break-even is [1 \u2212 F\u0304 (t)]/[1 \u2212 F\u0304be(t)] \u2248 0.17, corresponding to the gain G = 1/u \u2248 5.83 (near to 6 times the T4C code [15]). Therefore, the approximate AQEC with the RL code significantly surpasses the break-even point with an infidelity reduction of over 80%. We clarify that, similar to other AQEC schemes, leakage out of the error space ultimately limits the protection time \u03b3at, and eventually the system will end up in the ground state.\nCoupling engineering.\u2014 In contrast to previous AQEC proposals [15, 30], where complex codewords necessitate multiple nonlinear interactions and complicated control fields, AQEC based on the RL code only requires a Hamiltonian distance d = 1, which can be realized with a comparatively simple setting. Figure 2(a) depicts a possible scheme, where the encoding mode a is intermediately coupled to a dissipative mode c through a qubit.\n(b)\n(a)\nmode\nqubit mode\n(ms)t ( )t\n5 \u03c7 = g2/\u2206 can be larger than 7 \u00d7 2\u03c0 MHz [77\u201385]. It is thus possible to realize the scheme with linearly coupled systems. A low single-photon loss of 0.118\u00d7 2\u03c0 kHz has been achieved in experiments with 3D coaxial cavities, and the decay of the transmon qubits can be suppressed to 1.8\u00d72\u03c0 kHz [86\u201388]. We simulate the mean fidelity of the full quantum system in Fig. 2(b) with typical experimental parameters in superconducting circuits, \u03c9a/2\u03c0 = 3.5 GHz, \u03c9b/2\u03c0 = \u03c9c1/2\u03c0 = 5 GHz, \u03b3c1/2\u03c0 = 0.12 MHz, \u03c7/2\u03c0 = 3 MHz, \u03b10/2\u03c0 = 0.05 MHz, \u03b11/2\u03c0 = 0.07 MHz, \u03b3a1/2\u03c0 = 0.2 kHz, and \u03b3b/2\u03c0 = 2 kHz. We find that the mean fidelity of the RL code by far surpasses break-even threshold, and the model may be realized by engineering the coupling between a 3D coaxial cavity, a transmon qubit, and a dissipative cavity.\nDiscussion and conclusion\u2014We propose a bosonic code space for approximate AQEC with the shortest possible Hamiltonian distance d = 1, allowing for significantly reduced model complexity. Nevertheless, our scheme comfortably surpasses break-even threshold, outperforming other AQEC schemes that rely on larger Hamiltonian distances and disproving a previous claim that surpassing break-even threshold requires d \u2265 2. The codewords consist of Fock states rather than complex superposition states, and single-qubit logic gates in the RL code space are implemented with a maximum distance of dg = 2. The mean fidelity of the RL code can exceed break-even point by more than 36% at \u03b3at = 4, and the expected gain G = 1/(3\u22122 \u221a 2) \u2248 5.83 is more than twice the currently best experimental value G = 2.27 \u00b1 0.07 [89]. This demonstrates that, despite our AQEC scheme being approximate, which upper bounds the level of protection, it delivers logical qubits with significantly improved quality and thus may greatly facilitate subsequent QEC steps toward fully fault-tolerant qubits.\nWe would like to acknowledge the help of Professor JieQiao Liao and the valuable suggestions of Dr. Wei Qin, Dr. Ye-Hong Chen, Dr. Fabrizio Minganti, and Dr. Ran Huang.

An arbitrary state in the code space (i.e., the initial state) can be expanded as\n|\u03c8\u03b8\u03c6\u3009 = cos \u03b8\n2 |0L\u3009+ ei\u03c6 sin\n\u03b8 2 |1L\u3009 , (1)\nwhere |0L\u3009, |1L\u3009 are the logical codewords, and \u03b8, \u03c6 are the familiar Bloch sphere angles. A linear, positive definite, and trace-preserving map M[\u00b7] evolves the initial state \u03c1t0(\u03b8, \u03c6) = |\u03c8\u03b8\u03c6\u3009\u3008\u03c8\u03b8\u03c6| to the quantum state \u03c1t(\u03b8, \u03c6) = M[\u03c1t0(\u03b8, \u03c6)] at time t. With the fidelity between the evolved state \u03c1t(\u03b8, \u03c6) and the initial state \u03c1t0(\u03b8, \u03c6) given by F (\u03b8, \u03c6, t) = Tr[\u03c1t0(\u03b8, \u03c6)\u03c1t(\u03b8, \u03c6)], the mean fidelity of the code space can be written as\nF\u0304 (t) = 1\n4\u03c0\n\u222b\n\u2126\nF (\u03b8, \u03c6, t) d\u2126. (2)\nNext, we expand the initial state in terms of the logical Pauli operators\n\u03c1t0(\u03b8, \u03c6) = |\u03c8\u03b8,\u03c6\u3009 \u3008\u03c8\u03b8,\u03c6| = \u2211\nj=0,x,y,z\ncj(\u03b8, \u03c6) \u03c3j 2 , (3)\nwhere\n\u03c30 = |0L\u3009\u30080L|+ |1L\u3009\u30081L|, \u03c3x = |0L\u3009\u30081L|+ |1L\u3009\u30080L|, \u03c3y = i(|0L\u3009\u30081L| \u2212 |1L\u3009\u30080L|), \u03c3z = |1L\u3009\u30081L| \u2212 |0L\u3009\u30080L|,\n(4)\n\u2217 clemens.gneiting@riken.jp \u2020 fnori@riken.jp\nS2\n(a) (b)1\nFIG.

(b) Evolution of the mean fidelity with the number of steps for three randomly selected episodes. Other parameters are g/\u03b3a = 400 and \u03b3b/\u03b3a = 1750 (i.e., C \u2248 91.4).\nand the elements of the coherent Bloch vector are\nc0(\u03b8, \u03c6) = 1, cx(\u03b8, \u03c6) = sin \u03b8 cos\u03c6, cy(\u03b8, \u03c6) = sin \u03b8 sin\u03c6, cz(\u03b8, \u03c6) = cos \u03b8. (5)\nBy combining Eqs. (2), (3), (4), (5), we can reformulate the mean fidelity as\nF\u0304 (t) = 1\n4\u03c0\n\u222b \u03c0\n0\n\u222b 2\u03c0\n0\nTr\n\n\n\u2211\nj\ncj(\u03b8, \u03c6) \u03c3j 2 M [ \u2211\nk\nck(\u03b8, \u03c6) \u03c3k 2\n]\n\n sin \u03b8 d\u03c6d\u03b8\n= \u2211\njk\n1\n4\u03c0\n\u222b\n\u03b8\n\u222b\n\u03c6\ncjck sin \u03b8 d\u03c6d\u03b8Tr (\u03c3j 2 M [\u03c3k 2 ])\n= 1\n6\n\u2211\nj=\u00b1x,\u00b1y,\u00b1z\nTr (\u03c1jM [\u03c1j ]) ,\n(6)\nwhere we have defined \u03c10 = \u03c30/2 and \u03c1\u00b1j = (\u03c30 \u00b1 \u03c3j)/2 (j = x, y, z). This result is consistent with previous work [1].\nS2. SEARCH FOR THE OPTIMAL CODE SPACE WITH REINFORCEMENT LEARNING\nFinding the optimal coefficients c (0) n and c (1) n , such that the codewords, Eq. (2) of the main text, maximize the mean fidelity F\u0304 (|0L\u3009, |1L\u3009) at some fixed reference time, represents a complex optimization problem that we solve using reinforcement learning (RL). In brief, we divide each episode into a finite number of steps k = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,K. At step k the agent observes the state sk \u2208 S of the surrounding environment and chooses an action ak according to the policy \u03c0(A|S). Then the agent obtains the new state sk+1, and the environment returns a reward rk+1. The policy \u03c0(A|S) is updated via the experience data to maximize the accumulated reward R. The state sk contains six observations Tr(\u03c1jM(\u03c1j)), j = \u00b1x,\u00b1y,\u00b1z [see Eq.(6)] that can be calculated by using the toolkit Qutip [2, 3]. The action of the agent consists of the vector of coefficients [c (0) n , c (1) n ]. The reward rk+1 is proportional to the difference between the mean fidelities of the code space obtained by the policy function and of the break-even point, \u01ebk = F\u0304k(|0L\u3009, |1L\u3009) \u2212 F\u0304 (|0\u3009, |1\u3009). The specific reward scheme is as follows: if \u01ebk+1 > 0 and \u01ebk+1 > \u01ebk, the reward is 1000\u01ebk+1; if \u01ebk+1 > 0 and \u01ebk+1 < \u01ebk, the reward is 100\u01ebk+1; if \u01ebk \u2264 0, the reward is 0. We truncate the code space to 6 photons and set the maximum number of steps per episode to K = 11. The parameters for the simulation of the dynamics are chosen as g/\u03b3a = 400, \u03b3b/\u03b3a = 1750 (i.e., C \u2248 91.4), \u03b3a = 0.02 MHz, and \u03b3at = 0.6, in agreement with current experimental conditions. We apply the proximal policy optimization algorithm to optimize the policy [4], which is achieved by using the Python toolkit Ray [5]. The parameters of the neural networks are the default ones offered by Ray. As shown in Fig. S1(a), the mean reward approximately converges to a constant after about 200k episodes. Meanwhile, the max reward is obtained when the coefficient is c (0) 1 \u2248 1, c (1) 0 \u2248 1, and c (0) 0 \u2248 c (1) 1 \u2248 0. We thus conclude that the optimal code space consists of the Fock states |2\u3009 and |4\u3009.\nS3\nTo demonstrate that different initial states converge to the same mean fidelity, we display in Fig. S1(b) three random episodes. One can easily see that all three episodes converge towards the same mean fidelity (well above the break-even point of 0.84), in each case yielding the same optimal codewords, the Fock states |2\u3009 and |4\u3009, as described by the RL code.\nS3. ASSESSING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE APPROXIMATE AQEC\nHere we analytically assess the performance of the approximate AQEC. First, we solve the dynamical evolution for an arbitrary initial code state, and then calculate the mean fidelity. The dynamic evolution of the hybrid system composed of the encoding and the auxiliary mode is governed by the master equation\nd\u03c1 dt = \u2212i[HI , \u03c1] + \u03b3a 2 D[a] + \u03b3b 2 D[\u03c3\u2212], (7)\nwhere the Hamiltonian of the hybrid system is HI = g(Leng\u03c3+ +L \u2020 eng\u03c3\u2212), and the resulting error correction operator is the same as in the main text. If the parameters satisfy the conditions g, \u03b3a \u226a \u03b3b, we can approximately write the density operator of the hybrid system as \u03c1(t) = \u03c1a(t) \u2297 |0\u3009\u30080|, where \u03c1a(t) is the state of the encoding mode and |0\u3009\u30080| is the ground state of the auxiliary qubit. Therefore, the dynamical evolution of the encoding mode is governed by the effective master equation [6]\nd\u03c1a dt = \u03b3a 2 D[a] + \u03b3a\u03bb 2 D[Leng], \u03bb = 8|g|2 \u03b3b\u03b3a = 8C. (8)\nWithout loss of generality, we can restrict the effective master equation to the first five Fock states (from the ground state to four photons). The density matrix elements then satisfy the equations\n1\n\u03b3a\nd\u03c122 dt = 1 2 (6\u03c133 \u2212 4\u03c122 + \u03bb\u03c111),\n1\n\u03b3a\nd\u03c124 dt = 1 2 (\u22126\u03c124 + \u03bb\u03c113),\n1\n\u03b3a\nd\u03c144 dt = 1 2 (\u22128\u03c144 + \u03bb\u03c133),\n1\n\u03b3a\nd\u03c142 dt = 1 2 (\u22126\u03c142 + \u03bb\u03c131),\n1\n\u03b3a\nd\u03c111 dt = 1 2 (4\u03c122 \u2212 2\u03c111 \u2212 \u03bb\u03c111),\n1\n\u03b3a\nd\u03c113 dt = 1 2 (2 \u221a 8\u03c124 \u2212 4\u03c113 \u2212 \u03bb\u03c113),\n1\n\u03b3a\nd\u03c133 dt = 1 2 (8\u03c144 \u2212 6\u03c133 \u2212 \u03bb\u03c133),\n1\n\u03b3a\nd\u03c131 dt = 1 2 (2 \u221a 8\u03c142 \u2212 4\u03c131 \u2212 \u03bb\u03c131),\nwhere we have defined the density matrix as \u03c1a(t) = \u2211 ij \u03c1ij(t)|i\u3009\u3008j|.

Similar to other autonomous error correction schemes [1, 7], the error correction efficiency based on the RL code also depends on the evaluation time \u03b3at. If \u03b3at is too large, the system has decayed into the ground state (\u03c100(t) \u2248 1), i.e., the capability for AQEC is lost. Therefore, we limit \u03b3at to an appropriate scale \u03b3at \u2264 0.6. If \u03bb \u226b 24 (i.e., \u03bb \u2192 \u221e), we can approximate the density matrix to order zero in the parameters 1\u03bb and \u03b3at \u03bb\n\u03c1a(t) \u2248\n\n    0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u03c122(0) 0 \u03c124(0) exp(\u2212u\u03b3at) 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 \u03c142(0) exp(\u2212u\u03b3at) 0 \u03c144(0)\n\n   \n, u = 3\u2212 2 \u221a 2 \u2248 0.17.

Moreover, the fidelity between an individual initial state \u03c1a(\u03b8, \u03c6, 0) and the corresponding evolved state \u03c1a(\u03b8, \u03c6, t) is\nF (\u03c1a(\u03b8, \u03c6, 0), \u03c1a(\u03b8, \u03c6, t)) = Tr[|\u03c8\u03b8\u03c6\u3009\u3008\u03c8\u03b8\u03c6| \u03c1(\u03b8, \u03c6, t)] = 1 + 2 sin2 ( \u03b8\n2\n) cos2 ( \u03b8\n2\n)\n[exp(\u2212u\u03b3at)\u2212 1] , (12)\nwhich depends on the Bloch angle \u03b8, but not on the Bloch angle \u03c6 for \u03bb\u2192 \u221e. If the angle \u03b8 is equal to 0 and \u03c0, the fidelity is close to the maximum value of 1; if it is \u03c02 , then the fidelity is the lowest (about 0.95), but still well above the break-even point (about 0.84). For a comparison between the numerical and analytical results, we simulate the\nS5\n\uff08b\uff09\uff08a\uff09\nFIG. S3. Performance of the RL code in terms of the error-correctable fidelity.

For sufficiently large \u03c4 , the initial, delay-induced dip is removed. The resulting error-correctable fidelity reflects the irreversible fidelity loss.\ntime-dependent mean fidelity with different \u03bb in Fig. S2(a). Our results demonstrate that the mean fidelity increases with increasing \u03bb. Moreover, the numerical mean fidelity (i.e., simulating the master Eq. (8) with \u03bb = 8000) well agrees with the analytical solution Eq. (11) (i.e., \u03bb = \u221e). Similarly, we get very good agreement between analytical prediction and numerical evaluation for individual state fidelities, as shown in Figs. S2(b) and (c). Numerical fidelities are obtained by simulating the master Eq. (8) with \u03bb = 50, 000. This shows that our analytical results are reliable for \u03bb\u226b 24.\nS4. ERROR-CORRECTABLE FIDELITY\nAs a consequence of the finite rate of the engineered jump operator in AQEC, there is a delay between the occurrence of an error and the onset of the recovery jump. This becomes transparent if one unravels the evolution under the master equation (7) in terms of individual quantum trajectories. In Fig. S3(a) we demonstrate this with a random quantum trajectory for the initial state |2\u3009. Note that the fidelity drops to zero when an error occurs, and recovers to close to unity once the delayed recovery jump occurs (Let us clarify that other initial states, specifically, superpositions of the code words, would recover to fidelity values close to unity but lower, reflecting the approximate nature of the AQEC). Therefore, this random delay reduces the average fidelity when averaged over many trajectories, resulting in an initial dip as observed in Fig. S3(b) for \u03b3a\u03c4 = 0. However, the associated fidelity loss is, in principle, recoverable, as the information, while stored in the error space, is not lost. It is therefore instructive to distill the irreversible part of the fidelity loss, caused by the occurrence of multiple errors before correction and the imperfect state recovery under approximate AQEC. This can be achieved by using a temporally coarse-grained redefinition of the fidelity [8]:\nF \u2217\u03c4 (t) = max t\u2217\u2208[t, t+\u03c4 ] F (t\u2217). (13)\nIf the coarse-graining parameter \u03c4 is chosen sufficiently large, i.e., on the order of the average time delay, then the fidelity (13) ignores the delay-induced fidelity loss, reflecting the error-correctable fidelity. In Fig. S3(b) we demonstrate this with the RL code for different choices of \u03c4 . As expected, we find that the initial dip of the fidelity is removed with increasing \u03c4 . While the error-correctable fidelity provides valuable insight about the in-principle achievable performance of the\nautonomously corrected RL code, the standard fidelity remains the operationally relevant one. This is because, in the absence of monitoring, that is, if no additional information is gained about whether the state resides in the code space or in the error space, gate operations must be conducted under the (due to the delayed-error-correction process not necessarily correct) assumption that, at the time of the gate operation, the state resides in the code space.\nS5. NAIVE ERROR CORRECTION OPERATOR\nLet us consider another jump operator that may appear to counteract well the single-photon loss. When a singlephoton loss occurs, the encoded state is changed to the error state\na(cos \u03b8 2 |2\u3009+ ei\u03c6 sin \u03b8 2 |4\u3009) \u2212\u2192 cos \u03b8 2\n\u221a 2|1\u3009+ \u221a 4ei\u03c6 sin \u03b8\n2 |3\u3009.

(15) (dashed line) and the RL error correction operator from the main text (solid line); (c) Evolution of the mean fidelity resulting from the original master equation Eq. (8) (dashed line) or from the modified master equation (a\u2192 a+ a1) (solid line) for different \u03bb.\nTo steer the error state back to the code space undisturbed, one may tentatively use the following error correction operator, which is different from the one in the main text:\nLo = \u221a 2|2\u3009\u30081|+ |4\u3009\u30083|, Leng = Lo \u221a\nTr[L\u2020oLo] .

Correspondingly, the expressions for the fidelities F (|\u03c8\u03b8\u03c6\u3009\u3008\u03c8\u03b8\u03c6|, \u03c1a(\u03b8, \u03c6, t)) and F\u0304 (t) remain the same, cf. Eqs. (11) and (12): the only difference is u = 13 > 3 \u2212 2 \u221a 2. In Fig. S4(a), we show the fidelity over time for different \u03bb. We find that the analytical results coincide well with the numerical results for large enough \u03bb. In Fig. S4(b), we see that the efficiency of the RL error correction operator from the main text is higher than the error correction operator Eq. (15). Why is this? We can provide a physical reason: although the error correction operator Eq. (15) ensures that the information is not disturbed when the jumps occur, the time evolution in between the jumps, captured by the non-Hermitian terms in the master equation, acts detrimentally on the encoded information (i.e., \u03bb\u30081|F \u2020engFeng|1\u3009 \u226b \u03bb\u30083|F \u2020engFeng|3\u3009), resulting in an overall reduced performance compared to the RL error correction operator of the main text.\nS6. ANALYSIS OF THE KNILL-LAFLAMME CONDITION\nThe mean fidelity of the RL code, Eq. (11) remains slightly below one because the code words have different mean photon numbers: the Knill-Laflamme (KL) condition is only partially satisfied [9]. To understand the consequences\nS7\nof this better, let us modify the master equation by replacing the single-photon loss jump operator a by a + a1, where a1 = (2\u2212 \u221a 2)|1\u3009\u30082| (i.e., D[a] \u2192 D[a+ a1]). The modified jump operator now satisfies the condition \u30080L|(a+ a1) \u2020(a+ a1)|0L\u3009 = \u30081L|(a+ a1)\u2020(a+ a1)|1L\u3009 for the RL code, that is, the KL condition is satisfied. Therefore, we can completely correct the error a + a1 under the conditions 8g2\n\u03b3a\u03b3b \u2192 \u221e, 1\u03bb \u226a 1, and \u03b3at \u03bb \u226a 1. Next, we show that the\nmean fidelity can indeed reach unity under the 0-order approximation of the parameters 1\u03bb and \u03b3at \u03bb . To this end, let us again evaluate the corresponding master equation for the system up to four photons,\n1\n\u03b3a\nd\u03c122 dt = 1 2 (6\u03c133 \u2212 8\u03c122 + \u03bb\u03c111),\n1\n\u03b3a\nd\u03c124 dt = 1 2 (\u22128\u03c124 + \u03bb\u03c113),\n1\n\u03b3a\nd\u03c144 dt = 1 2 (\u22128\u03c144 + \u03bb\u03c133),\n1\n\u03b3a\nd\u03c142 dt = 1 2 (\u22128\u03c142 + \u03bb\u03c131),\n1\n\u03b3a\nd\u03c111 dt = 1 2 (8\u03c122 \u2212 2\u03c111 \u2212 \u03bb\u03c111),\n1\n\u03b3a\nd\u03c113 dt = 1 2 (8\u03c124 \u2212 4\u03c113 \u2212 \u03bb\u03c113),\n1\n\u03b3a\nd\u03c133 dt = 1 2 (8\u03c144 \u2212 6\u03c133 \u2212 \u03bb\u03c133),\n1\n\u03b3a\nd\u03c131 dt = 1 2 (8\u03c142 \u2212 4\u03c131 \u2212 \u03bb\u03c131).\n(18)\nWe approximately solve this equation by expanding to first order in the parameters \u03bb\u226b 1 and \u03bb\u226b \u03b3at,\n\u03c100(t) \u22481\u2212 ( 3\n\u03bb +\n3\n2\n)\n\u03c144(0)\n{\nexp\n[\n\u22128\u03b3at \u03bb +O\n(\n\u03b3at\n\u03bb\n)2 ] \u2212 exp [\n\u221224\u03b3at \u03bb +O\n(\n\u03b3at\n\u03bb\n)2 ]}\n\u2212 \u03c144(0) exp [\n\u221224\u03b3at \u03bb +O\n(\n\u03b3at\n\u03bb\n)2 ] \u2212 \u03c122(0) exp [\n\u22128\u03b3at \u03bb +O\n(\n\u03b3at\n\u03bb\n)2 ]\n+O\n(\n1\n\u03bb\n)2\n,\n\u03c111(t) \u2248 12\n\u03bb \u03c144(0)\n{\nexp\n[\n\u22128\u03b3at \u03bb +O\n(\n\u03b3at\n\u03bb\n)2 ] \u2212 exp [\n\u221224\u03b3at \u03bb +O\n(\n\u03b3at\n\u03bb\n)2 ]}\n+ 8\n\u03bb \u03c122(0) exp\n[\n\u22128\u03b3at \u03bb +O\n(\n\u03b3at\n\u03bb\n)2 ]\n+O\n(\n1\n\u03bb\n)2\n,\n\u03c122(t) \u2248 ( 3 2 \u2212 9 \u03bb ) \u03c144(0)\n{\nexp\n[\n\u22128\u03b3at \u03bb +O\n(\n\u03b3at\n\u03bb\n)2 ] \u2212 exp [\n\u221224\u03b3at \u03bb +O\n(\n\u03b3at\n\u03bb\n)2 ]}\n+\n(\n1\u2212 8\u03b3at \u03bb\n)\n\u03c122(0) exp\n[\n\u22128\u03b3at \u03bb +O\n(\n\u03b3at\n\u03bb\n)2 ]\n+O\n(\n1\n\u03bb\n)2\n,\n\u03c133(t) \u2248 8\n\u03bb \u03c144(0) exp\n[\n\u221224\u03b3at \u03bb +O\n(\n\u03b3at\n\u03bb\n)2 ]\n+O\n(\n1\n\u03bb\n)2\n,\n\u03c144(t) \u2248 ( 1\u2212 8 \u03bb ) \u03c144(0) exp\n[\n\u221224\u03b3at \u03bb +O\n(\n\u03b3at\n\u03bb\n)2 ]\n+O\n(\n1\n\u03bb\n)2\n,\n\u03c113(t) \u2248 8\n\u03bb \u03c124(0) exp\n[\n\u221216 \u03bb \u03b3at+O\n(\n\u03b3at\n\u03bb\n)2 ]\n+O\n(\n1\n\u03bb\n)2\n,\n\u03c124(t) \u2248 ( 1\u2212 8 \u03bb ) \u03c124(0) exp\n[\n\u221216 \u03bb \u03b3at+O\n(\n\u03b3at\n\u03bb\n)2 ]\n+O\n(\n1\n\u03bb\n)2\n. (19)\nThe density matrix is approximately equal to the initial state \u03c1a(0) for \u03bb\u2192 \u221e, so the mean fidelity is approximately equal to unity. This implies that we can fully correct the single-photon loss by adding the small correction term a1. In Fig. S4(c), we compare the error correction performance of the modified master equation (a \u2192 a + a1) and the original master equation (8) for different values of \u03bb. With increasing \u03bb, the modified master equation displays a better error correction ability. When \u03bb is small, the mean fidelity is lower due to \u30082|(a+ a1)\u2020(a+ a1)|2\u3009 > \u30082|a\u2020a|2\u3009. Finally, let us discuss the optimality of the RL code compared to codewords that are shifted in Fock space, i.e., have the general form |m\u3009, |m + 2\u3009 (for example, |1\u3009, |3\u3009 or |8\u3009, |10\u3009).

Other parameters are \u03b3a = 0.02 MHz, g = 8 MHz, and \u03b3b/g = 2.5.\nTherefore, high excitation numbers require large g/\u03b3a for the jump probability of Leng to be sufficiently large, which increases the difficulty of the experiment. Here we limit the range of the cooperativity C \u2264 160 to ensure experimentfriendly AQEC. Under this parameter condition, we simulate the mean fidelity for the code word |m\u3009, |m + 2\u3009 in Fig. S5. We find that the mean fidelity of the RL code is optimal compared to its shifted versions. It is worth noting that m = 0 is an invalid code space due to F (\u03c02 , \u03c6, t) < F\u0304be.\nS7. SETTING THE COUPLING BETWEEN THE QUBIT & THE ENCODING MODE PLUS THE\nAUXILIARY MODE\nHere we discuss in more detail how to realize our approximate AQEC scheme in an actual physical system. We consider a quantum system consisting of an encoding mode, an auxiliary qubit, and an auxiliary mode. The system Hamiltonian is given by\nH = \u03c9aa \u2020a+ \u03c9b 2 \u03c3z + \u03c9cc \u2020c+ \u03c7 2 a\u2020a\u03c3z + f(t)(a+ a \u2020)\u03c3x + gc(t)(c \u2020 + c)\u03c3x, (21)\nwhere \u03c7 is the dissipative coupling coefficient, g(t) and f(t) are two time-dependent control fields, and \u03c9a, \u03c9b, \u03c9c are the resonant frequencies of the encoding mode, the qubit, and the auxiliary mode, respectively. The system dynamics are then described by the master equation\nd\u03c1 dt = \u2212i[H, \u03c1] + \u03b3a1 2 D[a] + \u03b3b1 2 D[\u03c3\u2212] + \u03b3c1 2 D[c], (22)\nwhere \u03b3i1 (i = a, b, c) are the corresponding decay rates. The Hamiltonian (21) can be expanded with the eigenstates |EN,M,\u00b1\u3009 of the Hamiltonian H0 = \u03c9aa\u2020a+ \u03c9b2 \u03c3z + \u03c9cc\u2020c+ \u03c7 2 a\n\u2020a\u03c3z. Therefore, the Hamiltonian H can be rewritten as\nH= \u2211\nN,M\nEN,M |EN,M,\u00b1\u3009\u3008EN,M,\u00b1|+ f(t) \u221a N + 1(|EN+1,M,+\u3009\u3008EN,M,\u2212|+ |EN+1,M,\u2212\u3009\u3008EN,M,+|+ h.c.)\n+ gc(t) \u221a M + 1(|EN,M+1,+\u3009\u3008EN,M,\u2212|+ |EN,M+1,\u2212\u3009\u3008EN,M,+|+ h.c.),\n(23)\nwhere EN,M,\u00b1 = N\u03c9a +M\u03c9c \u00b1 (\u03c9b2 + N\u03c7 2 ) is the eigenvalue of the Hamiltonian H0. After switching to a rotating frame by applying the unitary operator U = exp(\u2212iH0t), the Hamiltonian can be written as\nHI= \u2211\nN,M\nf(t) \u221a N + 1(|EN+1,M,+\u3009\u3008EN,M,\u2212|ei(EN+1,M,+\u2212EN,M,\u2212)t + |EN+1,M,\u2212\u3009\u3008EN,M,+|ei(EN+1,M,\u2212\u2212EN,M,+)t)\n+gc(t) \u221a M + 1(|EN,M+1,+\u3009\u3008EN,M,\u2212|ei(EN,M+1,+\u2212EN,M,\u2212)t+|EN,M+1,\u2212\u3009\u3008EN,M,+|ei(EN,M+1,\u2212\u2212EN,M,+)t) + h.c. .\n(24)\nHere we assume for simplicity that the mode c and the qubit are resonant, \u03c9b = \u03c9c = \u03c9, and that the frequencies satisfy |\u03c9a + \u03c9|, |\u03c9a \u2212 \u03c9| \u226b \u03c7\u226b gc(t), |f(t)|. We can then use the control fields\nf(t) = 2\u03b10\u221a 2 cos [(E2,M,+ \u2212 E1,M,\u2212) t] + 2\u03b10\u221a 4 cos [(E4,M,+ \u2212 E3,M,\u2212) t] ,\ng(t) = 2\u03b11 cos [(E2,M,+ \u2212 E2,M+1,\u2212)t] + 2\u03b11 cos [(E4,M,+ \u2212 E4,M+1,\u2212)t] , (25)\nS9\n0 1 2 3\nt (ms)\n0.9\n1.0\nm ea n fid\nel it y\nHeff,0\nHeff,1 m ea\nn f\nid el\nit y 1\nFIG.
