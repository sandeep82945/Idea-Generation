FT-IR analysis revealed a chelating (1 and 2) and a bridging bidentate (3 and 4) coordination modes for the carboxylate ligand in solid state which was further confirmed by the single crystal X-ray analysis of complex 4. The NMR data (1H, 13C and 119Sn) revealed a higher coordination number around the tin center in R2SnL2 (1 and 2) compared to R3SnL (3 and 4). A close matching was observed between the experimental and calculated structures (obtained at B3LYP/6-31G* + LANL2DZ basis set). Quantum chemical analysis indicates that the carboxylate moiety has the major contribution in the formation of filled and unfilled orbitals as well as in ligand to ligand intramolecular charge transfer during the electronic transitions. The cytotoxicity data of the screened compounds evaluated against lung cancer cell line (A549) and normal lung fibroblast cell line (MRC-5) revealed that 1, 3 and 4 have shown dose dependent cytotoxic effects whileHL and 2 have shown steady and low cytotoxic activities. The antibacterial activity of complexes 1\u20134 is higher than that of HL. Molecular docking study showed an intercalation binding mode for complex 3 with DNA (docking score = \u22123.6005) involving four polar interactions. Complex 3 docking with tubulin (PDB ID 1SA0) with colchicine as a target protein resulted in three polar interactions (docking score \u22125.2957). Further, the docking analysis of the HL and 1\u20134 has shown an adequate interactions with the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, nucleocapsid protein and human angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2).\nKeywords: organotins, single crystal XRD, antibacterial activity, anticancer activity, molecular docking studies\nEdited by: Ranjan K.

            "text": "Cancer is the most threating disease of the present time. In spite of extensive research in the field, only few drugs are available commercially. Cis-platin being the lead one is associated with some severe side effects like neuro-, nephro-, and ototoxicity (Mubeen and Kini, 2012; Panteli\u0107 et al., 2019) which motivates the researchers for developing of non-platinum based anticancer drugs. Organotin(IV) carboxylates are found be the most promising alternatives, as these have shown higher apoptosis inducing character compared to the platinum complexes, both in vivo and in vitro (Indumathy et al., 2007; Butt et al., 2019). In addition to the anticancer potential, organotin(IV) carboxylates also possess significant antibacterial, antifungal, insecticidal, antituberculosis and antidiabetic activities (Kovala-Demertzi et al., 2009; Tzimopoulos et al., 2010; Tariq et al., 2013; Sirajuddin et al., 2014a; Sirajuddin et al., 2014b; Shah et al., 2015; Tariq et al., 2016; Debnath et al., 2019; Sirajuddin et al., 2021).\nIn spite of wide range available data on the anticancer activity of organotin(IV) carboxylates, exact conclusive results are not available on the cytotoxic effects of these complexes. Some possible targets identified for the anticancer activity of the organotin(IV) complexes are discussed in the form nucleotide base pairs, nitrogen atoms of DNA, phosphate groups on the backbone of DNA and the sulfhydryl groups on proteins (Gielen, 2008; Hong et al., 2015; Xiao et al., 2020).\nFor an effective interaction with these possible target sites and other bioactivities, the coordination expansion ability of Sn atom, number and nature of R groups bonded to Sn and nature of the carboxylate ligand are found the important controlling factors (Saxena and Huber, 1989; Hook, 1994; Gielen, 2003; Hadjikakou and Hadjiliadis, 2009; Sirajuddin et al., 2012). The nature of carboxylate ligand is quite important in deciding the bioactivity of the organotin(IV) complexes as it can alter hydro/lipophilicity of the complex and assist the transportation of complexes across the cell membrane (Cooney and Wuertz, 1989; Yeni\u015fehirli et al., 2010; Ettouhami et al., 2012). Also for the same ligand the earlier reported toxicity order is as: R3Sn > R2Sn > RSn. (Basu, 2008). In addition, the biological target (microorganism and stain, nature of the cancer cell lines) also significantly affect the activity as well.\nA. Lavecchia, et al., investigated the screening results for a series of chiral phenoxyacetic acid analogues agonist activity toward the human PPAR\u03b1 (hPPAR\u03b1) and PPAR\u03b3 (hPPAR\u03b3) subtypes and found some of analogues are potent PPAR\u03b1 agonists as well as PPAR\u03b3 agonists. Interestingly, for one of these analogues, the stereoselectivity toward PPAR\u03b1 was reversed which was further confirmed by docking experiments to rationalize this peculiar behavior (Fracchiolla et al., 2007). Santiago G\u00f3mez-Ruiz and Goran N. Kalu\u0111erovi\u0107 et al., reported the cytotoxic activity of phenoxyacetic acid based di and triphenyltin(IV) derivatives against tumor cell lines human adenocarcinoma HeLa, human myelogenous leukemia K562, human malignant melanoma Fem-x and normal immunocompetent cells, peripheral blood mononuclear cells PBMC. It is evidenced form their study that triphenyltin(IV) complexes show higher activities than the diphenyltin(IV) derivatives and some of the invested\ncompounds are more potent than cis-platin against all the tested cells and relative high selectivity especially on K562 cells (G\u00f3mez-Ruiz et al., 2008; Kalu\u0111erovi\u0107 et al., 2010). Tariq Ali et al., studied via docking studies the interactions of 2- chlorophenyl ethanoic acid based organotin(IV) complexes against the SARS-Co-2 virus which is responsible for the most challenging disease Covid-19 and found a considerable binding interactions of compounds with the angiotensinconverting enzyme 2 (ACE2) and with the nucleocapsid protein of the SARS- CoV-2 virus.\nThus keeping in view the biological importance of the phenoxyacetic acid derivatives especially against SARS- CoV-2 virus, here we have chosen the 4-chlorophenoxyacetate for the preparation of organotin(IV) complexes. The aim of the present study is to described the synthesis, characterization, in vitro anticancer and antibacterial activity of di- and tri-n-butyl/ methyltin(IV) derivatives of 4-chlorophenoxy acetic acid. The interaction of the synthesized compounds with DNA, spike protein, nucleocapsid protein of coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 and human angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) was also studied using molecular docking."

The presence of several additional weak/medium intensity bands in the spectra of the complexes below 500 cm\u22121 owing to Sn-O bond formation bolstered the claim.27 The existence of a set of two peaks in the ranges 1,609-1,580 cm\u22121 and 1,488- 1,409 cm\u22121 for complexes 1\u20134, corresponding to asymmetric and symmetric COO vibrations of the coordinated ligand,\nFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 8643365\nrespectively, was another notable aspect of the spectra of the complexes (Muhammad et al., 2019).

The 1H NMR spectra showed no singlet signal above 10 ppm, indicating the existence of a deprotonated carboxylate ligand in the complexes (Muhammad et al., 2019). A singlet was observed for the -CH2- protons (at position 2) in the range 4.68\u20134.54 ppm. An important observation for this signal is that, in case of diorganotin (IV) derivatives (1 and 2) the signal\nFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 8643366\nappeared in the down field region (at 4.68 ppm for 1 and at 4.60 ppm for 2) compared to the triorganotin (IV) derivatives (at 4.55 ppm for 3 and at 4.54 ppm for 4). This observation clearly indicates the coordination mode differences between di- and triorganotin(IV) derivatives. In case of diorganotin(IV) complexes (1 and 2) a bidentate mode of coordination can be observed in solution (Muhammad et al., 2019). This makes the carbonyl carbon (Cooney and Wuertz) and subsequently the methylene group (-CH2-) more de-shielded. However, in case of triorganotin(IV) derivatives a monodentate behavior of the carboxylate ligand causes less deshielding of the \u2013OOC\u2013CH2\u2013 fragment, so methylene signal appears a bit up field. The benzene ring protons of the ligand appeared as two doublets in the ranges 7.29\u20137.18 ppm and 6.91\u20136.79 ppm for 4,4\u2032 and 5,5\u2032, protons respectively. Complexes 2 and 4 gave clear singlets for tin bonded methyl groups at 0.84 and 0.61 ppm, respectively. The 2J (119Sn,1H) coupling constant values for these signals were found to be 101 and 59 Hz for 2 and 4 respectively. These values confirm hexa and tetra-coordinated tin cneter in solution for 2 and 4, respectively (Muhammad et al., 2019). In complexes 1 and 3, the n-butyl groups have shown a complicated pattern in form of multiplets for the\n\u2013CH2\u2013CH2\u2013CH2 skeleton. However, clear triplets were observed for the terminal CH3 groups in both the complexes.\nThe 13C-NMR spectra of complexes revealed six signals in the predicted locations for the magnetically non-equivalent carbons of the carboxylate ligand. By comparing the signals of the produced complexes to those of comparable reported tin carboxylate complexes, the carbons of the tin bound alkyl groups were allocated (Muhammad et al., 2014). Four coordinated tetrahedral tin centres have been verified in complexes 3 and 4 using 1J (119Sn,13C) coupling constant values of 343 and 394 Hz, respectively (Muhammad et al., 2014). In the carbon NMR spectra of all produced compounds, no additional peak was identified. This represented the pure character of synthesised complexes.\nThe 119Sn NMR of the reported compounds gave a sharp single (Supplementary Figure 2) and fall in the range of hexacoordinated (for complexes 1 and 3) and tetra-coordinated (for complexes 2 and 4) environment around the Sn atom (Sirajuddin et al., 2014a).\nThe representative 1H, 13C and 119Sn NMR spectra of complexes 2, 3 and 4 are given in Supplementary Figures 3\u20139."

The complex crystallizes in the monoclinic crystal system with a P21/c space group. The important crystallographic parameters, selected bond lengths and bond angles are presented in Tables 1, 2, respectively. Complex 4 adopted an infinite zig-zag 1-D polymeric chain structure consisting mono deprotonated bridging carboxylate ligands connecting the tin atoms as shown in Figure 1B. The Sn1-O1 and Sn1-O2 bond distances are 2.2018 (16) \u00c5 and 2.3803 (17) \u00c5, respectively showing a slight asymmetric coordination of the carboxylate ligand to the tin atom. The shorter tin-oxygen bond is associated with a longer C-O bond and vice versa. The Sn\u2013O bond distances are more close to the sum of the covalent radii of tin and oxygen (2.13 \u00c5), but are considerably less than the van der Waals radii (3.69 \u00c5), indicating a strong Sn\u2013O bonding interactions (Barsan et al., 2008; Shujah et al., 2014; An et al., 2020). The Sn-O bonded distances are comparable to the other trimethyltin (IV) carboxylate derivatives previously reported (Iqbal et al., 2013). Sn1-C9, Sn1-C10 and Sn1-C11 bond distances are 2.110 (3)\u00c5, 2.108 (3)\u00c5 and 2.123 (3)\u00c5, respectively. The tin atom in complex 4 has a five coordinated trigonal bipyramidal geometry. The two axial sites of the trigonal bipyramid are occupied by the oxygen atoms of the bridging carboxylate ligands with an O2-Sn1-O1 bond angle of 171.49 (6)\u00b0, showing distorted geometry around tin center. The three tin bonded methyl groups form the equatorial plane of the trigonal bipyramid. The sum of equatorial CH3-Sn-CH3 bond angles is 359.8\u00b0 which indicates that the three methyl groups are nearly coplanar and more symmetrically bonded compared to the oxygen atoms of the carboxylate ligands.

The calculated \u03c4 value for the complex 4 is 0.81. This indicates a distorted trigonal bipyramidal geometry around Sn center.

In metal complexes, there are different types of intramolecular charge transfer processes including metal to ligands, ligand to metal and ligand to ligand, etc. A careful analysis of Figure 4 shows that there is ligand to ligand intramolecular charge transfer upon electronic transition. It can be visualized from Figure 4 that the HOMO is localized mainly on the methoxy acetate groups of complex 4, while LUMO is confined to chlorobenzene ring of one side ligand. There is very little and/or negligible electron density on Sn metal which indicates that the Sn metal acts as more like a bridge for intramolecular charge transfer or redistribution upon electron transitions. On the other hand, the distributions of HOMO-1 to LUMO + 1 orbitals solely involve the chlorobenzene rings with significant contributions from chlorine atoms as can be seen in Figure 4. Overall a ligand to ligand charge transfer is evident from the analysis of Frontier molecular orbital analysis which indicates that the optoelectronic properties of complex 4 might be tuned exclusively by the ancillary ligands (Vogler and Kunkely, 1997).\n3.4.4 In Vitro Cytotoxicity of Ligand Acid HL and Complexes 1\u20134 In vitro cytotoxic effect of the free ligand acidHL and synthesized complexes 1\u20134was assessed against A549 andMRC-5 at different concentrations (0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 5, 10 and 50 \u03bcg/ml) for 24 and 48 h. The amount of DMSO used to dissolve the compounds was applied below the cytotoxicity limit (less than 0.1% range as suggested for the cell culture). The experimental findings regarding cell viability are presented in Figure 5 as well in tabulated form in Supplementary Table 1. Also, Figure 6 show the effect of studied concentrations of the tested compounds on the morphology of A549 and MRC-5 cell lines. The IC50 values are given in Table 3.\nAll the tested compounds showed an anticancer activity against A549 cell line. In a dose dependent manner, the anticancer activity of complexes 1, 3 and 4, increased by increasing their concentrations at 24 h. These complexes (1, 3 and 4) were found particularly more active anticancer agents against A549 at higher concentrations. Interestingly,\nFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 86433611\nthese complexes are not toxic at higher concentrations against MRC-5 cell line. However, complexes 1 and 3 exhibited cytotoxicity against MRC-5 at lower concentrations. The anticancer activity of the complexes 1, 3 and 4 slightly decreased after 48 h. The free ligand acid HL and complex 2 showed a lower and stable anticancer activity against A549 at all studied concentrations, at both 24 and 48 h. Also the toxic effect of the free ligand acid HL and complex 2 against MRC-5 was relatively very low at all studied concentrations.\nThe experimental results suggested a metal-based activity, as complexation increased the anticancer activity of the\nfree ligand acid HL. The activity was also affected by the length of the alkyl group, as complexes 1 and 3 with bulky n-butyl groups were found more active than complexes 2 and 4 with smaller methyl groups. In fact, among the tested complexes, the complex 3 showed higher anticancer activity. This reflects the importance of both lipophilicity as well as tin coordination number in anticancer activity of the synthesized complexes. In addition, the presence of three nonpolar n-butyl groups in complex 3 makes it more lipophilic. So, the movement of the complex through the cellular membrane of the target cell to reach the action site is easy. Also, the low coordinated tin atom (coordination number = 4 as confirmed\nFIGURE 9 | Complex 1-nucleocapsid protein interaction.\nFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 86433612\nby NMR spectra) in complex 3 is more exposed for interaction with the donor atoms of the biomolecule of the target cell. The argument is further supported by the lower cytotoxicity of complex 2, where, in this complex two smaller methyl groups and a higher coordination number of six as confirmed by NMR spectra offer lower lipophilicity and lesser exposed tin center, respectively. This makes the complex 2 a relatively weaker anticancer agent."

            "text": "The ligand acid and its organotin(IV) derivatives were docked with spike protein, nucleocapsid protein of corona virus SARSCoV-2 and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) of human. The docking analysis have shown reasonable interactions of the screened compounds with the active sites of the targets. The ligand acid HL (docking score = \u22123.6103) has shown four polar interactions, two H-acceptor, one \u03c0-H and one H-donor interaction with VAL 389, LYS 390, LYS 390 and GLU 37 active sites residues of spike protein as shown in Figure 8A. Complex 1 (docking score = \u22127.6506) has best docked pose with three polar H-donor interactions with SER 985, GLY 981 active residues of the spike protein as shown in Figure 8B. Complex 2 (docking score = \u22125.1539) has shown two polar interactions, one H-acceptor and one \u03c0-H with ILE 995 and ALA 998 active residues of spike protein as shown in Figure 8C. Complex 3 (docking score = \u22125.5353) has shown three polar interactions, two are H-\u03c0 and one are H-acceptor with TRP 868, TYR 1029 and LYS 1020 active residues of spike protein as shown in Figure 8D. Complex 4 (docking score = \u22123.7082) has shown three polar interactions, one H-donor, one H-acceptor and one \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction with LYS 1020, TRP 868 and TYR 1029 active residues of the spike protein. These polar interactions reflect that the synthesized complexes can interact spike protein and affect its ability to develop any interaction with the host receptor.\nThe ligand acid and synthesized complexes have also shown interactions with the nucleocapsid protein of the corona virus SARS-CoV-2. Complex 1 has shown best dock pose (\u22125.7402) with two polar interactions, one H-donor and one \u03c0-H interaction with GLU 63 and TRP 53 active site residues, respectively of the nucleocapsid protein as shown in Figure 9. The ligand acid HL (\u22123.2769), complex 2 (\u22123.1275), complex 3 (\u22123.6005) and complex 4 (\u22122.2132) have shown three, two, four and two polar interactions, respectively in form of H-donor/ acceptor, \u03c0-H andH-\u03c0 polar interactions as mentioned in Table 5 (Supplementary Figures 10\u201313). The higher docking scores of the test compounds with spike protein compared to the\nnucleocapsid protein show that the test compounds offer best dock poses for interactions with spike protein as target for the corona virus SARS-CoV-2 inhibition.\nMolecular docking studies with angiotensin converting enzyme also reflected best dock pose for the complex 1 (docking score = \u22126.1678) with four polar interactions, one H-donor and three H-acceptor interactions with GLN 442, PHE 438, ARG 518 and THR 371 active sites as shown in Figure 10 (a). Complex 2 (docking score = \u22125.6760) has shown six polar interactions, twoH-donor and one H-\u03c0 and three \u03c0-H interactions with GLU 406, ASP 367, HIS 374, THR 371, and LYS 441 active sites as shown in Figure 10B. Complex 3 (docking score = \u22125.1188), complex 4 (docking score = \u22123.5105) and ligand acid HL (docking score = \u22123.4990) have shown one, three and two polar interactions respectively, with the active site residues of the angiotensin converting enzyme as mentioned in Table 6 (Supplementary Figures 14\u201317). The docking analysis shows that the free ligand acid and its complexes can interact with the three possible targets sites involved in corona disease. The complex 1 with relatively higher docking scores offered the best dock poses for the interaction with the active site residues of all the three targets."

            "text": "Four organotin(IV) derivatives (n-C4H9)2SnL2 (1), (CH3)2SnL2 (2), (n-C4H9)3SnL (3) and (CH3)3SnL (4) of 4- chlorophenoxyacetic acid (HL) were synthesized and characterized. The ligand has shown a chelating (1 and 2) and bridging (3 and 4) coordination modes to the tin centre in solid state. The NMR (1H, 13C and 119Sn) results have shown higher coordination number for tin in diorganotin(IV) derivatives (1 and 2) compared to the triorganotin(IV) derivatives (3 and 4) in solution. The calculated structure of complex 4 at B3LYP/6-31G* + LANL2DZ level of theory indicated a good resemblance with the experimentally\nTABLE 6 | Ligand acid (HL) and complexes 1\u20134 interaction report with angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2).\nCode Ligand Receptor Residue Interaction Distance E Docking score\nHL C 8 O PRO 490 (A) H-donor 3.25 \u22120.3 \u22123.4990 6-ring CB TYR 613 (A) pi-H 3.52 \u22120.6 1 C 11 OE1 GLN 442 (A) H-donor 3.05 \u22122.0 \u22126.1678 Cl 25 CE1 PHE 438 (A) H-acceptor 3.68 \u22120.2 O 48 NH2 ARG 518 (A) H-acceptor 2.77 \u22120.6 Cl 63 CG2 THR 371 (A) H-acceptor 3.93 \u22120.2 2 C 13 OE2 GLU 406 (A) H-donor 3.35 \u22120.4 \u22125.6760 C 36 OD1 ASP 367 (A) H-donor 3.16 \u22120.2 C 25 5-ring HIS 374 (A) H-pi 3.68 \u22120.6 6-ring CG2 THR 371 (A) pi-H 3.63 \u22120.2 6-ring CG LYS 441 (A) pi-H 4.34 \u22120.4 6-ring CE LYS 441 (A) pi-H 4.03 \u22120.3 3 Cl 28 OH TYR 515 (A) H-acceptor 3.59 \u22120.2 \u22125.1188 4 Cl 31 CE MET 366 (A) H-acceptor 3.58 \u22120.2 \u22123.5105\nCl 31 CE1 PHE 438 (A) H-acceptor 3.57 \u22120.2 Cl 31 NZ LYS 441 (A) H-acceptor 3.41 \u22120.9\nFrontiers in Pharmacology | www.frontiersin.org April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 86433614\ndetermined X-ray single crystal structure. Quantum chemical analysis indicated the significant involvement of the 4- chlorophenoxyacetate in the formation of Frontier molecular orbitals of the complex 4. The in vitro cytotoxic effect of the HL against A549 and MRC-5 has increased after complexation with organotin(IV) moieties in the complexes 1\u20134. Complex 3 with more lipophilic character and low coordinated tin atom offered higher cytotoxicity. The in vitro antibacterial activity order HL > n-butyltin(IV) derivatives (1 and 3) > methyltin(IV) deivaitves (2 and 4) against the tested bacterial strains reflected an organic mode of action for the tested compounds. The docking study (for complex 3) has suggested tubulin in complex with colchicine (docking score \u22125.2957) as better anticancer target compared to DNA (docking score = \u22123.6005). The docking interactions of the synthesized complexes (especially 1) with all the three possible targets (spike and nucleocapsid protein of corona virus SARS-CoV-2 and angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE2) of human) make the organotin(IV) carboxylates as potential candidates for further studies in corona virus treatment in future.\nDATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT\nThe datasets presented in this study can be found in online repositories.
