    "abstractText": "Biochar is an important soil amendment that can enhance the biological properties of soil, as well as nitrogen (N) uptake and utilization in N-fertilized crops. However, few studies have characterized the effects of urea and biochar application on soil biochemical traits and its effect on paddy rice. Therefore, a field trial was conducted in the early and late seasons of 2020 in a randomized complete block design with two N levels (135 and 180 kg ha\u22121) and four levels of biochar (0, 10, 20, and 30 t ha\u22121). The treatment combinations were as follows: 135 kg N ha\u22121 + 0 t B ha\u22121 (T1), 135 kg N ha\u22121 + 10 t B ha\u22121 (T2), 135 kg N ha\u22121 + 20 t B ha\u22121 (T3), 135 kg N ha\u22121 + 30 t B ha\u22121 (T4), 180 kg N ha\u22121 + 0 t B ha\u22121 (T5), 180 kg N ha\u22121 + 10 t B ha\u22121 (T6), 180 kg N ha\u22121 + 20 t B ha\u22121 (T7) and 180 kg N ha\u22121 + 30 t B ha\u22121 (T8). The results showed that soil amended with biochar had higher soil pH, soil organic carbon content, total nitrogen content, and mineral nitrogen (NH4-N and NO3-N) than soil that had not been amended with biochar. In both seasons, the 20 t ha\u22121 and 30 t ha\u22121 biochar treatments had the highest an average concentrations of NO3-N (10.54 mg kg\u22121 and 10.25 mg kg\u22121, respectively). In comparison to soil that had not been treated with biochar, the average activity of the enzymes urease, polyphenol oxidase, dehydrogenase, and chitinase was, respectively, 25.28%, 14.13%, 67.76%, and 22.26% greater; however, the activity of the enzyme catalase was 15.06% lower in both seasons. Application of biochar considerably increased the abundance of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB), which was 48% greater on average in biochar-amended soil than in unamended soil. However, there were no significant variations in the abundances of ammonia-oxidizing archaea (AOA) or nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB) across treatments. In comparison to soil that had not been treated with biochar, the average N content was 24.46%, 20.47%, and 19.08% higher in the stem, leaves, and panicles, respectively. In general, adding biochar at a rate of 20 to 30 t ha\u22121 with low-dose urea (135 kg N ha\u22121) is a beneficial technique for improving the nutrient balance and biological processes of soil, as well as the N uptake and grain yield of rice plants.",

            "text": "Rice serves as the main staple diet for more than half of the world\u2019s population and was cultivated on more than 165.25 Mha of land worldwide in 2019\u201320, and a total of 466.31 Mt of grain was produced annually during this period; losses of nitrogen (N) thus pose a serious challenge to paddy rice cultivation [1,2]. In China, 23% of the country\u2019s croplands\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 527. https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms11020527 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/microorganisms\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 527 2 of 20\nare utilized for rice production, representing roughly 20% of the world\u2019s total [3,4]. A metaanalysis revealed that the N use efficiency of rice was 28.1% in China from 2000 to 2005 [5], which is lower compared with estimates of N use efficiency in the United States (52%) and Europe (68%) over the same period [6]. Future generations will be under more strain due to the modern era\u2019s ever-growing demand for food and energy, as fossil fuel use rises and the energy crisis intensifies. To meet these problems and reduce environmental risks, new ecofriendly measures are necessary. The use of environmentally friendly techniques that emit fewer greenhouse gases and mitigate N leaching losses can reduce the ecological costs of farming [7] and maintain the capacity of ecosystems to supply ecosystem services without compromising food security. The addition of biochar to soil as an organic amendment to increase soil carbon (C) stocks, enhance soil physiochemical and biological properties, accelerate soil nutrient cycling and enhance crop yields has attracted much research attention [8\u201310]. Prior studies have revealed that the biochar in soil can enhance the availability of nutrients and C sequestration, increase soil pH and the cation-exchange capacity, and alter nutrient cycling by regulating soil microbial communities [9,11]. In addition, biochar plays a crucial role in the soil N cycle by decreasing the leaching of inorganic N and nitrous oxide (N2O) emissions [12], which promotes organic nitrogen fixation [13]. Furthermore, due to its high surface area and ion exchange capacity, biochar could successfully adsorb NH4+-N and NO3\u2212-N ions [14]. Thus, biochar has become increasingly used as a soil conditioner to improve soil quality and enhance productivity. Soil biological properties have been proposed to be key factors in soil biochemical properties, and the microbiological indicators of soil provide a sensitive indicator of soil health in both aquatic and agro-ecosystems [15]. In general, microbial functions and soil fertility are closely linked, because microorganisms play crucial roles in the mineralization of various natural elements, including carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus (P) [16], and soil enzymes facilitate biochemical processes in the soil [17]. Enzymatic activity in soil is considered to be one of the more sensitive markers of anthropogenic disturbance [18]. Soil enzymatic activity also provides a reflection of the biological properties of soil [2]. The types of enzymes, the amount of biochar applied, and the characteristics of the soil all have a major role in how biochar affects soil enzyme activities. The soil enzymes\u2019 activity rate due to biochar application in the soil largely depends on the enzyme types, the amount of biochar applied and the soil properties [9,19]. Nitrification is one of the crucial process in the N cycle; it involves microorganisms oxidizing ammonium (NH4+) to produce nitrate (NO3\u2212), which then releases soil N for plant growth and development [20] and production of a denitrification substrate [21]. According to Li et al. [22], nitrification involves two stages: the oxidation of ammonia to nitrite, which is catalyzed by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA), and the oxidation of nitrite to nitrate, which is catalyzed by nitrite-oxidizing bacteria (NOB). The majority of these microbes are autotrophic aerobes. Although their particular metabolism gives them a special niche, this in turn causes delayed and ineffective growth. The rate of application of biochar can change soil N2O emissions, which in turn can affect the abundances of AOB, AOA, and NOB [23]. Few pieces of research, meanwhile, have examined how biochar rates with high- and low-dose urea application can affect the enzymes activity, AOB, AOA, and NOB abundances in paddy soil [24]. In recent years, there has been a lot of focus on the advantages that biochar has for soil qualities. A few recent studies have shown that biochar has the ability to alter N cycling in soil by affecting nitrification and denitrification, which are a major sources of N2O [13,23]. Hardly any investigations have studied the effects of different levels of biochar under high- and low-dose N application on soil chemical properties, soil enzyme activities, and the abundances of AOB, AOA, and NOB in double-cropping rice systems. Due to its unique physical and chemical characteristics, we thus hypothesized that biochar can be utilized as a soil supplement to increase soil nutrients, augment the availability of microorganisms, and increase rice yield. The specific objectives of this study were as\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 527 3 of 20\nfollows: (1) to assess whether biochar amendment has a significant effect on soil nutrients or changes the activities of soil enzymes and nitrogen cycling microbes; and (2) to compare whether there is a significant difference in plant nitrogen uptake and the grain yield of rice under low- and high-dose urea application with various biochar rates."

This site experiences a warm, humid subtropical climate with a seasonal monsoon and an annual average temperature and precipitation of 23.29 \u25e6C and 1491 mm, respectively (Figure 1). The soil of the experimental field is classified as a Ultisol, and the basic physio-chemical properties are as follows: pH (5.91), bulk density (1.37 g cm\u22123), soil organic carbon (SOC) (9.85 g kg\u22121), total N (1.23 g kg\u22121), potassium (K) (12.13 g kg\u22121), and P (0.62 g kg\u22121). The experiments were carried out in a randomized complete block design with two N levels (135 and 180 kg ha\u22121) and four levels of biochar (0, 10, 20, and 30 t ha\u22121). The treatment combinations were as follows (T: treatment; N: nitrogen; B: biochar): T1: = 135 kg N ha\u22121 + 0 t B ha\u22121; T2: = 135 kg N ha\u22121 + 10 t B ha\u22121; T3: = 135 kg N ha\u22121 + 20 t B ha\u22121; T4: = 135 kg N ha\u22121 + 30 t B ha\u22121; T5: = 180 kg N ha\u22121 + 0 t B ha\u22121; T6: = 180 kg N ha\u22121 + 10 tB ha\u22121; T7: = 180 kg N ha\u22121 + 20 t B ha\u22121; and T8: = 180 kg N ha\u22121 + 30 t B ha\u22121.

Bao [25] guidelines for measuring soil moisture content were followed. A 0.5 mm sieve was used to filter air-dried soil, and the weight of the tin (g) was recorded as W1. Along with the tin, a 1 g soil sample was collected, and it was weighed as W2. To obtain a constant weight of W3, the soil samples were dried in an oven for two hours at 105 \u25e6C. The percentage soil moisture content was measured as\nMC % = W2\u2212W3 W3\u2212W1\nSoil organic carbon was measured using the oxidation method. After boiling at 175 \u25e6C for 5 min, soil samples (0.5 g) were digested with 5 mL of 1 mol K2Cr2O7 and 5 mL of concentrated H2SO4. The excess chromic acid is determined by titration with FeSO4 and the quantity of the substance oxidized is calculated from the amount of dichromate reduced [25]. Weighing either 1 g of plant tissue or 2 g of soil allowed us to calculate the total nitrogen. 1 g of potassium sulfate, copper sulfate, and selenium powder in a ratio of 100:10:1 were added as a catalyst in a digestion tube along with the sample. Concentrated H2SO4 was then added (5 mL for the plant samples and 10 mL for the soil). A digester (X20A aluminum module automatic digester, Shanghai Shengsheng Automatic Analytical Instrument Co., Shanghai, China) was used to place the digestion tube, and it was heated to 370 \u25e6C before being digested until clear (2 h for plant samples, 4 h for soil samples).

As per Bao. [25], samples were titrated with sulfuric acid, and the volume was recorded to determine the N concentration. Inorganic N (NH4+-N and NO3\u2212-N) concentration was assessed using the method described by Maynard et al. [26]. After being shaken for an hour at 200 rpm and filtered through a 0.45-um polysulfone membrane, soil samples were extracted with 2 M KCl. The amount of N that the KCl removed was then quantified colorimetrically."

Initially, 1 g of soil was placed in a 10-mL centrifuge tube, and 0.2 mL of toluene was added. After 15 min, 2 mL of 10% urea solution and 4 mL of pH 6.7 citrate buffer solution were added; the mixture was then shaken well and incubated in a 37 \u25e6C incubator for 24 h. The mixture was centrifuged, and 0.375 mL of the supernatant was added to a 10-mL centrifuge tube. Next, 0.5 mL of sodium phenate solution and 0.375 mL of sodium hypochlorite solution were added, and the mixture was shaken. After 20 min, when the color developed, 5 mL of water was added and the mixture was mixed well. Finally, the urease activity was determined using a spectrophotometer at 578 nm within 1 h. Urease activity was expressed as the number of mg of NH3\u2013 in 5 g of soil after 24 h. Soil catalase activity was determined following the standard procedure of Li et al. [27]. Specifically, 0.5 g soil samples were placed in a 10-mL volumetric flask, and 6.4 mL of distilled water and 0.8 mL of a 0.3% H2O2 solution were added; the mixture was then covered tightly and shaken for 20 min, and 0.16 mL of saturated aluminum potash was added, followed by 0.8 mL of 1.5 mol sulfuric acid. After centrifugation, the absorbance of the supernatant was measured at 240 nm; a soil-free control was also used. Catalase activity was expressed in mg of hydrogen peroxide per g of soil decomposed in 20 min. Polyphenol oxidase activity was determined following the method of Guan et al. [28]. Soil samples (2 g) were placed in a 50-mL Erlenmeyer flask, and then 10 mL of 1% pyrogallol solution was added; the flask was then shaken and kept in a thermostat at 30 \u25e6C for 2 h. After removing the mixture from the thermostat, 4 mL of citric acid\u2013phosphate-buffered solution (pH 4.5) was added, followed by 35 mL of ether; the mixture was then shaken vigorously several times, and the extraction procedure was conducted for 30 min. The colored ether phase containing the dissolved purple gallate was colorimetrically determined at a wavelength of 430 nm. To prevent errors caused by ether, the colorimetric solution tank was washed with anhydrous ethanol after every color comparison. To account for the error caused by the original ether-soluble organic matter in the soil and the purity of gallic phenol, soil without substrate and substrate without soil were used as controls. In the control soil without substrate, the substrate was cultivated with water instead of substrate. The amount of purple gallate can be determined from a standard curve drawn with potassium dichromate. The activity of polyphenol oxidase is expressed in mg of purple gallate in 1 g of soil after 2 h. Dehydrogenase activity was measured by taking 5 g of fresh soil samples that have passed through a 1.25 mm sieve and placing them in a cork with a stopper. Next, 2 mL of 1% 2%, 3%, and 5% triphenyltetrazolium chloride solution and 2 mL of distilled water were added to each of the flasks and mixed thoroughly. They were then placed in a 37 \u25e6C incubator in the dark for 6 h. After incubation, 5 mL of methanol was added, and the mixture was shaken vigorously for 1 min, 20 s and left to stand for 5 min, respectively. All the substances in the Erlenmeyer flask were then placed into the colorimetric tube and washed with a small amount of methanol two to three times; the liquid was filtered into the colorimetric tube and diluted to 25 mL, The absorbance value was then measured at 485 nm, as described by Guan et al. [28]. Chitinase activity was determined following the procedure of Bao, [25], weighing 10 g of fresh soil and adding 0.75 mL of toluene. After 15 min, 5 mL of 1% chitin colloid and 10 mL of phosphate buffers (pH 6.0) were added. After incubation\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 527 6 of 20\nat 37 \u25e6C for 16 h, the supernatant was centrifuged and frozen.

In the early season, the maximum activity rate was recorded in T4, which was 127.21% and 41.13% higher compared with T1 and T2, respectively, and this difference was significant (p < 0.05); however, no significant differences were observed among T1, T5, T6, T7, and T8 (Figure 3B). In the late season, T2 had 138.54% higher dehydrogenase activity than T1; however, with the exception of T2, all treatments were found to be statistically non-significant with T1. Similarly, chitinase enzyme activity was highest in soil amended with biochar under low-dose urea application in both seasons. Moreover, in the early season, the activity of the chitinase enzyme was 39.34% higher in T2 than in T1, and the differences between T2 and the other treatments were significant. In the late season, chitinase activity was 47.54%, 53.54% and 35.94% higher in T3 than in T1, T5, and T7, respectively (Figure 3C). T3 was statistically on par (p < 0.05) with all treatments except T1, T5, and T7.

During both seasons, sole urea application or the interaction of urea and biochar application had no significant effect on AOA abundance. The combined application of urea and biochar increased the AOA abundance slightly more than urea application alone. The concentration of AOA was highest (0.206 \u00d7 105 copies g\u22121 soil) in T6 in the early season, and it was 15.26% higher than in T5. In the late season, the abundance of AOA was found to be at a minimum (0.141 \u00d7 105 copies g\u22121 soil) in T4 and a maximum in T7 (0.206 \u00d7 105 copies g\u22121 soil). The abundance of AOA varied among treatments and generally increased with high-dose urea (180 kg N ha\u22121) under biochar application.

            "text": "The rapidly growing human population and demand for food hav resulted in an increase in the use of synthetic N fertilizers, which reduces N use efficiency and cau es various environmental problems [30,31]. To mitigat the deleterious effects of hemic l N fertilizers on soil qual ty and health, we studied the physical, chemical, and biological properties of soil and plant N uptake in a rice paddy fiel in early and late se sons in 2020 under low- and high-dose urea pplication and diff rent levels of bioch application. Soil pH and concentrations of SOC, total nitrogen, and itrate w r high r in 20 and 30 t B ha\u22121, applied with 135 or 180 kg N ha\u22121, than in treatments applied solely with urea (T1 and T5). One possible explanation for the higher soil pH under combined application of biochar and urea might be the alkaline nature of biochar; the porous structure of biochar and its high inner surface area might be responsible for the observed enhancement of soil chemical properties [32]. Moreover, the probable reason for the improvement of the soil pH and SOC in the current study is due to the biochar used in the experimental investigation having high porosity, the presence of hydrophilic domains, and a significant specific surface area; all of these factors have an impact on soil properties. Biochar application can decrease\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 527 14 of 20\nfertilizer requirements and increase microbial activity, soil water-holding capacity, and SOC content, which can enhance the physical properties of soil [33,34]. Biochar application improves SOC and causes significant increases in the TN, and NO3\u2013-N as compared to NH4+-N (Table 2). This outcome could be attributed to the experimental site\u2019s limiting of NH4+ which serves as the substrate for microorganisms that oxidize ammonia, as well as biochar\u2019s capacity to promote nitrification through the adsorption of nitrification-inhibiting chemicals including phenols and terpenes. According to Biederman and Harpole [35], the improvements in soil nutrients are associated with increases in the SOC content mediated by biochar application, as well as mineral substances dissolved in soil solutions. Biochar has been reported to increase soil pH and promote the retention of plantavailable water because of its high specific surface area and alkalinity [36,37]. We observed significant differences in water concentration, carbon and nitrogen stocks among treatments varying in levels of urea and biochar application (p < 0.05). This indicates that biochar elevates soil organic carbon levels, resulting in high carbon to nitrogen ratios, which could promote soil nitrification and enhance nitrogen\u2019s bioavailability. Rashid et al. [37] discovered that biochar can improve soil C reserves, encourage the retention of soil nutrients, and maximize soil fertility, which is in line with our findings. Utilizing biochar increases the effectiveness of utilizing both nutrients and water [38]. According to Lima et al. [39], using biochar improves the efficiency of using both nutrients and water."

            "text": "The capacity for biochemical reactions, soil microbial activity, nutrient cycling, and material metabolism can all be measured using the soil enzyme activity as a reference index. Due to their great sensitivity to environmental changes, soil enzymes\u2019 activity can reveal changes in soil quality in a variety of situations [40]. In our study, some of the tested soil enzyme (urease, polyphenol and dehydrogenase) activities were higher in biochar-amended soils than in soils not amended with biochar; the only exception was catalase activity in the early and late seasons. This could be as a result of the close relationship between soil enzyme activity and soil nutrients\u2019 richness, microbial diversity, and organic matter content. According to previous studies, biochar addition might stimulate soil enzyme activity by (1) altering the physicochemical properties of soil [41], (2) absorbing substrates on its surface, or (3) inhibiting the enzymes\u2019 reaction sites [9,42]. In the current study, in the early season, a positive effect was observed between biochar and N fertilizer on soil urease, polyphenol oxidase at 20 t B ha\u22121 and 180 kg N ha\u22121 and dehydrogenase activity at 30 t B ha\u22121 and 135 kg N ha\u22121. A key regulator of the nitrogen cycle in soil is urease; it is primarily involved in stimulating the hydrolysis of urea and acts as a fundamental reference signal for determining the quantity and ability of soil nitrogen mineralization. Urease activity was highest in biochar-applied soil. Given that the application of biochar promotes N mineralization, N-cycling enzyme activity increases with biochar application [42], as was observed in the positive correlation of urease with SOC in our study (R2 = 0.57) (Figure 7). Soil enzyme activities might be affected by soil pH, which aligns with the results of an earlier study [43]. Zhao et al. [44] reported that root growth stimulated by biochar can lead to the excretion of enzymes into the soil. In our study, soil polyphenol oxidase and dehydrogenase was higher with biochar applied at 20 and 30 t ha\u22121, compared with only urea at 135 kg ha\u22121 and 180 kg ha\u22121. The activities of these enzymes increased with the rate of biochar application, and a similar pattern was observed in SOC. This could possibly be the result of increases in dissolved and soil organic matter following the application of biochar, which improves the diversity and number of soil microbes and the activity of enzymes [23]. Therefore, we speculate that the activities of enzymes increased due to increases in SOC induced by biochar application. Similar results for C-cyclase enzymes, which are present on the surface of biochar and are implicated in the colocalization and stability of C compounds, were published by Foster et al. [45]. Oxidoreductase enzymes include polyphenol oxidase and dehydrogenase. They play a significant role in the cycling of soil aromatic compounds and are mostly\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 527 15 of 20\nobtained from plant wastes, root exudates, and soil microbes [46]. Both soil organic carbon and active organic carbon, which are important markers that influence soil enzyme activity, are increased by biochar. Soil polyphenol oxidase and dehydrogenase have different activities, and application of biochar amplified each of these enzyme activities, which is similar to the findings of Huang et al. [47]. The augmentation of carbon sources and nutrient content which may have been immobilized by soil microbes must have been one of the primary causes of this increase (Table 2). As a result, the addition of a significant amount of biochar and urea increased soil nitrogen concentration and entertained a microbial niche. In contrast to these findings, biochar had no more impact on soil catalase activity in both early and late seasons than it did on other N and C-cycling enzymes; this could be attributed to seasonal variation as well as the physical and chemical composition of the soil [23]. The results of our study indicate that biochar application plays a key role in enhancing the activities of soil enzymes in paddy soil under high- and low-dose N fertilizer applications."

            "heading": "4.3. Effect of Urea and Biochar Application on the Abundances of AOB, AOB, and NOB",
            "text": "The abundance of AOB increased significantly with the rate of biochar application under low-dose urea application; it was also high under all levels of biochar application and high-dose urea application (p < 0.05), and this was associated with the higher NO3\u2013-N concentration in these soils (Table 2). The abundances of AOA and NOB were slightly higher in the N fertilizer + biochar treatments than in the N fertilizer treatments alone; however, no significant differences in AOA and NOB abundances were observed between these two sets of treatments (Figures 5 and 6). These results imply that by increasing the abundance of AOB in paddy soil with combined application of N and B fertilizer, one can enhance nitrification. According to the results of a previous study conducted in natural and alkaline soil, AOB plays a greater role in soil nitrification than AOA when N fertilizer is applied [48,49]. However, the effects of biochar on the abundances of AOA and AOB differed among treatments in both seasons. For example, there was significant variation among treatments in the abundance of AOB, and biochar addition had no significant effect on the abundance of AOA. Unlike our findings, Prommer et al. [50] documented that biochar addition increased the abundances of both AOB and AOA in agricultural soil, which enhanced soil potential nitrification rates. Similarly, Song et al. [51] found that higher abundances of AOA increased the soil ammoxidation rate in coastal saline soil. Increases in AOB and AOA abundances due to biochar application could have several explanations. First, biochar has a vast surface area and a highly porous structure which, along with its strong ability to hold water and retain nutrients, facilitate the provision of resources that meet the particular metabolic requirements of microbes [52]. Second, biochar can enhance living conditions for soil microorganisms by increasing the pH of soil [53]. Third, the SOC and NO3 in biochar enhance soil AOB abundance (R2 = 0.61 and R2 = 0.47, respectively; Figure 7). Finally, biochar might absorb substances that inhibit nitrification, such as polyphenols or tannins [53,54]. However, a few studies have shown that biochar application has no effect or even a negative effect on soil nitrification [55,56]. This could be due to the release of nitrification inhibitors such as ethylene and pinene, which reduce the activity of soil AOA and AOB [54,57], and the effect varies depending on the parent materials and biochar formation processes used. In our study, the abundance of NOB varied among the biochar-applied treatments; however, differences in the abundance of NOB among treatments were not significant, indicating that AOB was more sensitive to biochar application in paddy soil compared with AOA and NOB. Much research consistent with our findings, has shown that the addition of N fertilizer increases the abundance of AOB, but not AOA or NOB [58,59]."

            "heading": "4.4. Effect of Urea and Biochar Application on Plant N Uptake, DM, and Grain Yield",
            "text": "Nitrogen is usually the most yield-limiting nutrient in rice production, and its uptake by rice is closely associated with N presence and loss in soil [60]. Nitrogen accumulation in biochar-applied treatments was significantly higher in biochars 20 and 30 t ha\u22121, applied\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 527 16 of 20\nwith 135 kg N ha\u22121 and 180 kg N ha\u22121, in the early and late seasons, than treatments applied solely with urea (135 kg N ha\u22121). The increase in N uptake might stem from improvements in the soil\u2019s physiochemical properties and increases in microbial activity due to the high rate of biochar application [61]. Furthermore, no significant differences were found in the leaf and panicles nitrogen concentration between low-dose and highdose N fertilizer applications without biochar. Our findings are consistent with those of Ali et al. [62], showing that N accumulation increases under high rates of biochar application along with N fertilizer application. Similarly, Huang et al. [60] revealed that biochar application to paddy soil enhances the uptake of fertilizer N (23\u201327%). Biochar application affects root morphological characteristics, enhances DM accumulation, and increases plant N uptake [33]. Huang et al. [63] showed that the application of biochar to paddy fields increases N uptake in rice and improves N use efficiency. The accumulation of plant-available nutrients in biochar can lead to increases in the total N content in soil [60]. In our study, dry matter production was significantly higher in biochar-applied treatments than in treatments in which biochar was not applied in the early season. Although, in late season maximum dry matter produced in treatments applied with 30 t B ha\u22121 with low dose urea (T4) and biochar 20 and 30 t ha\u22121 with high dose urea applied (T7 and T8). Increases in DM can be attributed to improvements in soil properties (Figure 7, SOC = R2 = 0.94, NO3 = 0.63) and enzymatic activities due to biochar application (Table 2), which enhances plant N uptake and DM production (Tables 3 and 4). Possible explanations for these increases include the positive effects of biochar and N fertilizer on soil fertility and DM production in rice [33,34], which enhance plant growth [64]. Another possible reason is that biochar improves plant DM and N uptake [61,65]. Zahoor et al. [66] reported that increases in the supply of N fertilizer can increase biomass enzymatic saccharification and DM production in rice. The yield of cereal crops depends on plant growth and N accumulation; a previous study has shown that DM accumulation is responsible for 23\u201368% of grain yield, which is in turn determined by soil properties and agronomic practices [67]. It is likely that in the current study, rice grain yield was highest in the combined application of biochar 20 and 30 t ha\u22121 and urea 135 and 180 kg ha\u22121 in the early and late seasons, respectively. Rice grain yield was found to be lowest in sole urea application (135 kg N ha\u22121) in both seasons, and it varied significantly across treatments. The increase in rice grain yield under biochar application might have fluctuated with enhanced soil physiochemical properties, soil microbial biomass, and the rate of photosynthesis under biochar addition. Although an increase in soil pH due to the addition of biochar generally increases the richness of AOB and alkaline N in acidic soil [68], another study has shown that application of biochar formed from coconut husk enhances nutrient retention by decreasing the abundance of nitrifiers and the nitrification process, which ultimately increases grain yield [64,69]. Biochar addition increased N uptake, which resulted in a positive interaction with DM production and grain yield (Figure 7). Our findings are in line with the results of Ali et al. [33], showing that nitrogen accumulation and grain yield are highest under high rates of biochar application applied with N fertilizer in paddy rice."

Ultimately, it also improved N uptake by rice plants, DM production, and grain yield in both early and late seasons. The findings show that there are no significant (p < 0.05) differences between treatments utilizing urea at low (135 kg ha\u22121) and high (180 kg ha\u22121) doses in combination with 20 or 30 t ha\u22121 of biochar in terms of soil NO3 concentrations, plant N uptake, or grain production. Therefore, in double-cropping rice systems, urea application at 135 kg ha\u22121 with biochar 20 or 30 t ha\u22121 provides appropriate soil C and N stocks, improves the microbial community, and raises rice yield. Additional research is required to determine how biochar application could be transformed over time in paddy soil to increase rice yield.\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 527 17 of 20\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/microorganisms11020527/s1.
