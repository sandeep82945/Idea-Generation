    "abstractText": "Motivation: One of the main causes hampering predictability during the model identification and automated design of gene circuits in synthetic biology is the effect of molecular noise. Stochasticity may significantly impact the dynamics and function of gene circuits, specially in bacteria and yeast due to low mRNA copy numbers. Standard stochastic simulation methods are too computationally costly in realistic scenarios to be applied to optimization-based design or parameter estimation. Results: In this work, we present IDESS (Identification and automated Design of Stochastic gene circuitS), a software toolbox for optimizationbased design and model identification of gene regulatory circuits in the stochastic regime. This software incorporates an efficient approximation of the Chemical Master Equation as well as a stochastic simulation algorithm\u2014both with GPU and CPU implementations\u2014combined with global optimization algorithms capable of solving Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming problems. The toolbox efficiently addresses two types of problems relevant in systems and synthetic biology: the automated design of stochastic synthetic gene circuits, and the parameter estimation for model identification of stochastic gene regulatory networks. Availability and implementation: IDESS runs under the MATLAB environment and it is available under GPLv3 license at https://doi.org/10. 5281/zenodo.7788692.",

            "text": "The field of Synthetic Biology is making rapid progress toward achieving fully automated design of DNA sequences to reprogram cells with novel functions and capabilities. Software tools for the automated design of biocircuits can be categorized based on whether they focus on the steady-state input\u2013output behavior (Nielsen et al. 2016) or address the dynamics of the biocircuit (Otero-Muras et al. 2016, Tanevski et al. 2016, Sents et al. 2023), considering the underlying mathematical models. One milestone within the first category is CELLO\u2014see the most recent version by Jones et al. (2022)\u2014based on Boolean logic gates. Importantly, CELLO is the first design environment that has been calibrated with experimental data (originally in E.coli, and most recently also in yeast S.cerevisiae), and it outputs the DNA sequence required to implement the logic circuit provided as an input. Within the second category, SYNBADm (Otero-Muras et al. 2016) tackles high levels of biological complexity by combining dynamic models based on Ordinary Differential Equations (ODEs) with multiobjective optimization across\nparameter and topology spaces. The tool takes as input the design target behavior defined by the user and delivers as output the specific biocircuit (topology and parameters) needed to achieve this desired behavior. The scope of SYNBADm is restricted to the deterministic regime (scenarios in which the effects of molecular noise can be neglected).\nIt has been extensively reported how noise can play a crucial role in gene circuit engineering (Beal 2017). There are different sources of noise (Pischel et al. 2017) that can affect the dynamics of biocircuits, including the inherent stochasticity of the biochemical reactions involved (intrinsic noise). The impact of stochasticity on the dynamics of gene circuits when the copy numbers are low is well established. However, automated design of biocircuits under the effects of molecular noise is challenging due to the computational cost of stochastic simulations using standard methods.\nIn this work, we present Identification and automated Design of Stochastic gene circuitS (IDESS), a software toolbox for automated design and identification of biocircuits in the stochastic regime.

It includes CPU and GPU parallel implementations of the Stochastic Simulation Algorithm (SSA) (Gillespie 1976) and the semi-Lagrangian Simulation method in SELANSI (Pa\u0301jaro et al. 2018). This semi-Lagrangian numerical method simulates a Partial Integro-Differential Equation (PIDE) model describing the biocircuit dynamics. One significant advantage of this method is its efficiency to compute the whole probability distribution of the random variables (protein levels) describing the state of the system over time. IDESS utilizes Global Optimization solvers capable of optimizing efficiently over high dimensional search spaces of continuous real and discrete integer variables, including Mixed Integer Nonlinear Programming (MINLP) solvers to optimize simultaneously across parameter and topology search spaces."

The CME that describes the dynamics of stochastic gene regulatory circuits consists of the following system of ODEs (see Ge and Qian 2013):\ndP dt t;X\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc XM m\u00bc1 P t;X mm\u00f0 \u00deam X mm\u00f0 \u00de P t;X\u00f0 \u00deam X\u00f0 \u00de; (1)\nwhere P denotes the probability distribution associated to the N proteins, mm captures the stoichiometry and am the\npropensity of each of the reactions and M is the number of reactions. The dimension of this ODE system exploits in realistic scenarios making unfeasible or impractical to solve it directly. The PIDE model that we use to approximate the CME is formulated as follows (see Pa\u0301jaro et al. 2017):\n@P @t t;X\u00f0 \u00de \u00bc XN i\u00bc1 @ @Xi \u00bdciX X\u00f0 \u00deXiP t;X\u00f0 \u00de\n\u00fe XN i\u00bc1 kim \u00f0Xi 0 bi Xi Yi\u00f0 \u00deci Y\u00f0 \u00deP t;Y\u00f0 \u00dedYi :\n(2)\nIDESS implements both the SSA algorithm, and the semiLagrangian method solving the PIDE model. It is important to note that, while the SSA algorithm provides realizations of the dynamics (time course trajectories), the PIDE model provides the whole probability distribution over time. Moreover, IDESS includes the optional use of GPU parallelization to run simultaneously a large number of SSA simulations or to greatly speed up the semi-Lagrangian algorithm for solving the PIDE model. It is also worth noting that, although the original formulation takes into account only intrinsic noise, extrinsic noise can be easily incorporated through the input function ci Y\u00f0 \u00de in Equation 2."
