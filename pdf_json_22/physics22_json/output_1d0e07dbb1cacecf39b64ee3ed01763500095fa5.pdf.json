            "text": "In modern mathematical physics, studies on the relations between continuous, discrete,\nand ultra-discrete integrable dynamical systems have been developed extensively\n[6, 3, 7, 9, 24, 27]. Motivated by many studies in this field, and in particular by\nthose based on the theory of crystals [13, 14] and that of geometric crystals [1], the\nauthor and T. Yoshikawa [26] constructed a new class of discrete integrable systems\nthat can be viewed as a geometric lifting of a class of integrable cellular automata\nknown as the periodic box-ball systems [17, 18, 19, 31, 32]. Since they are related to\na realization of type An\u22121 geometric crystals and geometric R-matrices by G. Frieden [4, 5], we called the new integrable systems closed geometric crystal chains.\nFrom a conventional viewpoint, the rank of the affine Lie algebra An\u22121 is related to\nthe number of solitons in the periodic box-ball system. In this viewpoint, the geometric\nlifting of the system has already known and identified with the discrete periodic Toda\nchain [8, 15]. On the other hand, this rank is related to the number of degrees of freedom\nin each site variables in our construction. Therefore, a closed geometric crystal chain\nis not equivalent to the discrete periodic Toda chain. As a result, while the discrete\nToda chain yields the Toda equation in a continuum limit, it is unclear what kind of\ndifferential equations will be derived from the closed geometric crystal chains in such\na limit, except for the case of n = 2 that was studied in \u00a72.3.2 of reference [26].\nThe purpose of this paper is to give an outlook for extending this result to the\ncase of general n. We present two types of systems of differential equations that can\nbe derived from the chains. One is equation (1), which is a kind of extended LotkaVolterra systems [2, 11, 21]. The other is equation (24) with a function e (\u03b1) L\u22121 in (3), which seems to be generally new but reduces to a previously known system studied\nin [23] in a special case (36). An important point here is that both equations are\nrelated to Lax equations associated with the loop elementary symmetric functions,\nwhich were originally introduced in reference [20] for a description of products of affine\ntype A geometric crystals for symmetric tensor representations. (We shall use its\nvariation in reference [10]. ) Examples of the derivations of the continuous time\nLax equations from a discrete time one are described in detail, where a novel method\nof taking a continuum limit by assuming asymptotic behaviors of the eigenvalues of\nthe Lax matrix in Puiseux series expansions is used. In those examples, the method\nof imposing periodic boundary conditions on the discrete integrable systems in [26],\nwhich uses Perron-Frobenius theorem, turns out to be related to an unexpected way of\ntaking the continuum limit. We expect that it will provide a new technique for studying\nthe above mentioned relations between various types of integrable dynamical systems.\nIn this paper we restrict ourselves to the case of n = 4 for such explicit derivations.\nDiscussions for more general cases will be explored in a separate publication.\nThe remaining part of this paper is organized as follows. In \u00a72 we study a system\nof differential equations that can be viewed as a kind of the extended Lotka-Volterra\nsystems. We introduce the loop elementary symmetric functions in \u00a72.1, and define a matrix L with elements given by them. We present Theorem 1, which is the first result of this paper, showing that the system of differential equations leads to a Lax equation satisfied by L with a companion matrix Y . A proof of this theorem is shown in \u00a72.2, where the Lax equation is decomposed into a set of Lax triads [25]. In \u00a72.3, we study\nseveral properties that can be derived from the Lax equation. In \u00a73 we introduce\nanother system of differential equations related to the loop elementary symmetric\nfunctions. The second result of this paper, Theorem 7, is presented in \u00a73.1 to show that the system of differential equations leads to a Lax equation satisfied by L with another companion matrix Z. A proof of this theorem is shown in \u00a73.2, where the Lax equation is decomposed into another set of Lax triads. In \u00a73.3, we study several properties that\ncan be derived from the Lax equation. In \u00a74, we present a connection of the systems of\ndifferential equations and the closed geometric crystal chains. We give a brief review of the latter system in \u00a74.1 mainly for the case that can be described by 4\u00d74 matrices as an example. In \u00a74.2, \u00a74.3, and \u00a74.4, we give discussions for deriving the two types\nof differential equations from the closed geometric crystal chains in the case of n = 4,\nwhere Theorems 13 and 14 are presented as the third and fourth results of this paper.\nSeveral concluding remarks are given in \u00a75 and a few detailed calculations are shown\nin Appendix A and Appendix B."

Using the expression e (\u03b1) 1 = \u2211L\u22121 k=0 u (\u03b1\u2212k) 1+k , we can write e\n(\u03b1\u2212jL) 1 =\u2211L\u22121\nk=0 u (\u03b1\u2212jL\u2212k) 1+k = \u2211L\u22121 k=0 u (\u03b1\u2212jL\u2212k) 1+k+jL .

First we suppose p \u2264 n 2 . Then min(Lp\u2212 1, L(n\u2212 p)) = Lp\u2212 1.

Hence we have y(\u03b1)(\u03c3i\u22121U) = (n\u2212 p)c0 \u2212 \u2211L(n\u2212p) j=1 u (\u03b1+j) i\u2212j and y\n(\u03b1)(\u03c3iU) = (n\u2212 p)c0 \u2212\u2211L(n\u2212p) j=1 u (\u03b1\u2212j) i+j , so that (15) follows.\nRemark 5 Let the loop elementary symmetric functions e (\u03b1) i be denoted by e (\u03b1) i (U) for showing their dependence on the variable U . Suppose p = 1 or the condition L \u2261 1 ( mod n) is satisfied.

As a byproduct, we are going to see that this equation on the Lax matrix L and a matrix of the form Y in (6) basically determines the expression for y(\u03b1) uniquely. Equation (7) with a matrix of the form Y in (6) is also equivalent to the set of differential equations\nde (\u03b1) i\ndt = e\n(\u03b1) i\n( y(i+\u03b1\u2212L) \u2212 y(\u03b1) ) + e\n(\u03b1) i+1 \u2212 e (\u03b1\u22121) i+1 . (20)\nLetting i = L, we see that e (\u03b1) L (= \u220fL i=1 u (\u03b1) i ) is a conserved quantity, because e (\u03b1) L+1 = 0 for any \u03b1.

Therefore it suffices to show that\nu (\u03b1) i e (\u03b1) L\u22121(\u03c3 iU) =\n( i\u22121\u220f\nl=1\nu (\u03b1) l\nL\u220f\nk=i+1\nu (\u03b1\u22121) k )\u22121 e (\u03b1) L\u22121(U),\nfor any \u03b1 \u2208 Z/(nZ) and 1 \u2264 i \u2264 L. This relation is proved by applying Lemma 9 on\nthe left hand side repeatedly as,\nu (\u03b1) i e (\u03b1) L\u22121(\u03c3 iU) = u (\u03b1\u22121) i e (\u03b1) L\u22121(\u03c3 i\u22121U)\n= u (\u03b1\u22121) i u (\u03b1\u22121) i\u22121 . . . u (\u03b1\u22121) 1\nu (\u03b1) i\u22121 . . . u (\u03b1) 1\ne (\u03b1) L\u22121(U)\n=\n( i\u22121\u220f\nl=1\nu (\u03b1) l\nL\u220f\nk=i+1\nu (\u03b1\u22121) k )\u22121 e (\u03b1) L\u22121(U),\nwhere we used \u220fL\nk=1 u (\u03b1\u22121) k = e (\u03b1\u22121) L = 1. The proof is completed.\nRemark 11 There is a simple expression for the system of differential equations (24)\nthat can be compared with equation (18) in the type I case. In fact, from the above\nconsiderations we see that equation (24) is written as\ndu (\u03b1) i\ndt =\n1\ne (\u03b1) L\u22121(\u03c3\niU) \u2212 1\ne (\u03b1+1) L\u22121 (\u03c3\ni\u22121U) . (35)\nIn particular, consider the case of L = 2. If we define u(\u03b1) = u (\u03b1) 1 , then we have u (\u03b1) 2 = 1/u (\u03b1) because we set e (\u03b1) L = 1. Therefore one has\ndu(\u03b1)\ndt =\nu(\u03b1)\nu(\u03b1)u(\u03b1\u22121) + 1 \u2212 u\n(\u03b1)\nu(\u03b1)u(\u03b1+1) + 1 . (36)\nThis is basically the same differential equation that was appeared in reference [23] as\nequation (13.58), where its discretization was referred to as a lattice KdV equation."

Based on the notion of rational rectangles in [4, 5], we introduce the set Y1 = (R>0) n\u22121\u00d7R>0. Let (x, s) denote an element of Y1 with x = (x(1), . . . , x(n\u22121)), and let x(n) := s/(x(1) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7x(n\u22121)). Furthermore, we define x(i) for arbitrary i \u2208 Z to be a variable determined from x by the relation x(i) = x(i+n). In what follows, we set\nn = 4. Given (x, s) \u2208 (R>0)3 \u00d7 R>0, we define the matrices g\u2217 and g by\ng\u2217(x, s;\u03bb) =   x(1)x(2)x(3) \u03bb \u03bbx(3) \u03bbx(2)x(3) x(1)x(2) x(4)x(1)x(2) \u03bb \u03bbx(2) x(1) x(4)x(1) x(3)x(4)x(1) \u03bb\n1 x(4) x(3)x(4) x(2)x(3)x(4)\n  , (38)\ng(x, s;\u03bb) =   x(1) 0 0 \u03bb 1 x(2) 0 0 0 1 x(3) 0\n0 0 1 x(4)\n  . (39)\nActually, any element of the matrix g\u2217(x, s;\u03bb) is so defined as to be an order 3 minor\nof the matrix g(x, s;\u03bb). For instance, the top-left element of the former is equal to the determinant of the top-left 3\u00d7 3 submatrix of the latter. By Theorem 16 of [26], we see that for any s, l \u2208 R>0 and (b1, . . . ,bL) \u2208 (R>0)3L, there is a unique positive real solution (v,b\u20321, . . . ,b \u2032 L) \u2208 (R>0)3(L+1) to the equation\ng(b1, s;\u03bb) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 g(bL, s;\u03bb)g(v, l;\u03bb) = g(v, l;\u03bb)g(b\u20321, s;\u03bb) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 g(b\u2032L, s;\u03bb). (40)\nFor any |b\u3009 = (b1, . . . ,bL), let L(|b\u3009;\u03bb) be the matrix\nL(|b\u3009;\u03bb) = g(b1, s;\u03bb) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7g(bL, s;\u03bb), (41)\nwhich is called a Lax matrix, and let M (1) l (|b\u3009) be the matrix\nM (1) l (|b\u3009) = g\u2217(b1, s; l) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 g\u2217(bL, s; l), (42)\nwhich we call the monodromy matrix of the Lax matrix L(|b\u3009;\u03bb) with \u03bb = l. Note that every matrix element of M\n(1) l (|b\u3009) is an order 3 minor of L(|b\u3009; l). Note also that, if\nthe eigenvalues of L(|b\u3009; l) are given by \u00b51, \u00b52, \u00b53, \u00b54, then the eigenvalues of M(1)l (|b\u3009) are given by \u00b51\u00b52\u00b53, \u00b51\u00b52\u00b54, \u00b51\u00b53\u00b54, \u00b52\u00b53\u00b54, where the multiplicity of the eigenvalues has been taken into account (Corollary 29 of [26]).\nLet E be the largest eigenvalue in absolute value of matrix M (1) l (|b\u3009), and\n~P = (P1,P2,P3, 1)t be an eigenvector corresponding to E. By the Perron-Frobenius theorem, E is real positive, ~P is uniquely determined, and P1,P2,P3 are all positive. Then, the solution v \u2208 (R>0)3 of equation (40) is given by v = (P3,P2/P3,P1/P2) (Proposition 15 of [26]). This unique solution v allows us to define T\n(1) l : (R>0) 3L \u2192 (R>0) 3L to be the map given by\nT (1) l (b1, . . . ,bL) = (b \u2032 1, . . . ,b \u2032 L), (43)\nwhich is called a time evolution. Due to equation (40), this time evolution (43) is\ngoverned by a discrete time analogue of the Lax equation\nL(T (1)l |b\u3009;\u03bb) = g(v, l;\u03bb)\u22121L(|b\u3009;\u03bb)g(v, l;\u03bb). (44)\nIn what follows, we are going to show that this equation reduces to the continuous time Lax equation (7) in the limit l \u2192 \u221e, or to equation (27) in the limit l \u2192 0, by making several reasonable assumptions."

Let l = 1/\u03b4 4. By expressing the solution of equation (49) by the Cramer formula and then substituting the asymptotic forms (54)\nand (55) into it, we obtain the expressions\nP1 = 1\n\u03b43 + (e\n(3) 1 \u2212 c0)\n1\n\u03b42 +O\n( 1\n\u03b4\n) ,\nP2 = 1\n\u03b42 + (e\n(2) 1 + e (3) 1 \u2212 2c0)\n1 \u03b4 +O (1) ,\nP3 = 1\n\u03b4 + (e\n(1) 1 + e (2) 1 + e (3) 1 \u2212 3c0) +O (\u03b4) . (56)\nFrom this result and equation (17), one sees that the asymptotic form of the matrix g(v, l;\u03bb) with v = (P3,P2/P3,P1/P2) and l = 1/\u03b44 is expressed as equation (51), in which Y is a matrix of the form (6) with n = 4, p = 3. Hence we obtain the continuous time Lax equation (7) in the limit \u03b4 \u2192 0, in the same way as for the case of p = 1."

            "text": "As in the previous subsection, we assume that n = 4 but now let L(\u2265 2) be an arbitrary integer. We define\nU\u03bb =  \n\u03bb\n1\n1\n1\n  . (57)\nConsider the matrix (41) with s = 1 and rewrite equation (44) as\nL(T (1)l |b\u3009;\u03bb) = (U\u22121\u03bb g(v, l;\u03bb))\u22121 \u00b7 (U\u22121\u03bb L(|b\u3009;\u03bb)U\u03bb) \u00b7 (U\u22121\u03bb g(v, l;\u03bb)). (58) Accordingly, we adopt the interpretation\nL(t) = U\u22121\u03bb L(|b\u3009;\u03bb)U\u03bb, L(t+ d\u03b4) = L(T (1) l |b\u3009;\u03bb), (59)\nwhere d is a parameter that will be determined later. Let them to be identified with the matrix L given by (4), but in which the set of variables for the loop elementary symmetric functions (2) should be interpreted as\nu (\u03b1\u22121) i (t) = b (\u03b1) i and u (\u03b1) i (t+ d\u03b4) = (b \u2032 i) (\u03b1), (60)\nrespectively. Here we used the notations defined by T (1) l |b\u3009 = (b\u20321, . . . ,b\u2032L) and b\u2032i = ((b \u2032 i) (1), (b\u2032i) (2), (b\u2032i) (3)). The first equation of (60) implies that in the matrix L(|b\u3009;\u03bb) we must replace e(\u03b1)m by e(\u03b1\u22121)m when we change its variables from the b\u2019s to the u\u2019s. After this replacement in (4) and with the condition e\n(\u03b1) L = 1 for all \u03b1, the\nasymptotic form of the Lax matrix L(|b\u3009; l) under the limit l \u2192 0 is given by\nL(|b\u3009; l) \u2248   1 e (4) L\u22123l e (4) L\u22122l e (4) L\u22121l e (1) L\u22121 1 e (1) L\u22123l e (1) L\u22122l\ne (2) L\u22122 e (2) L\u22121 1 e (2) L\u22123l e (3) L\u22123 e (3) L\u22122 e (3) L\u22121 1\n  . (61)\nNote that the condition e (\u03b1) L = 1 is preserved under the time evolution T (1) l , which can be obtained from equation (40) with \u03bb = 0. We assume that the eigenvalues \u03beq (q \u2208 Z/4Z) of the Lax matrix L(|b\u3009; l) under the condition s = 1 and for sufficiently small l\u2019s are given by the Puiseux series expansion\n\u03beq =\n\u221e\u2211\nm=0\ndm exp ( \u03c0 \u221a \u22121mq 2 ) lm/4, (62)\nwhere d0 = 1. This assumption is consistent with the relations\n(1\u2212 l)L = detL(|b\u3009; l) = 4\u220f\nq=1\n\u03beq = (d0) 4 +O(l),\n4 +O(l) = TrL(|b\u3009; l) = 4\u2211\nq=1\n\u03beq = 4d0 +O(l),\nwhere we used the identity det g(bi, 1; l) = 1 \u2212 l for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 L, and the expression (61). Then, the asymptotic form of the largest eigenvalue of the monodromy matrix M (1) l (|b\u3009) is given by\nE = \u03be1\u03be3\u03be4 = 1 + d1l 1 4 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (63) From the expression (61), we see that the asymptotic form of the monodromy matrix M (1) l (|b\u3009) under the limit l \u2192 0 is given by\nM (1) l (|b\u3009) \u2248   1 O(l) O(l) e(4)L\u22121l e (3) L\u22121 1 O(l) O(l)\nO(1) e(2)L\u22121 1 O(l) O(1) O(1) e(1)L\u22121 1\n  . (64)\nFrom (63) and (64) one sees that\n0 = det(M (1) l (|b\u3009)\u2212 EI4) = ((d1)4 \u2212 e (1) L\u22121e (2) L\u22121e (3) L\u22121e (4) L\u22121)l +O(l\n5 4 ),\nwhich forces us to set d1 = ( \u220f4 \u03b1=1 e (\u03b1) L\u22121) 1/4. Let l = \u03b44. Again by using the solution of equation (49) expressed by the Cramer formula and then now substituting the\nasymptotic forms (63) and (64) into it, we obtain the expressions\nP1 = 1\nd1 e (4) L\u22121\u03b4\n3 +O ( \u03b44 ) ,\nP2 = 1\n(d1)2 e (4) L\u22121e (3) L\u22121\u03b4\n2 +O ( \u03b43 ) ,\nP3 = 1\n(d1)3 e (4) L\u22121e (3) L\u22121e (2) L\u22121\u03b4 +O\n( \u03b42 ) = d1\ne (1) L\u22121\n\u03b4 +O ( \u03b42 ) . (65)\nWe show a detailed derivation of this result in Appendix A.2. Therefore, the asymptotic form of the matrix U\u22121\u03bb g(v, l;\u03bb) with v = (P3,P2/P3,P1/P2) and l = \u03b44 is expressed as\nU\u22121\u03bb g(v, \u03b4 4;\u03bb) =   1 P2/P3 1 P1/P2\n1 \u03b44/P1 P3/\u03bb 1\n  = I4 + d1\u03b4 \u00b7 Z +O ( \u03b42 ) , (66)\nwhere Z is a matrix of the form (25) with n = 4. To summarize, we state the result of the above arguments in the case of n = 4, s =\n1 as:\nTheorem 14 Let U\u22121\u03bb L(|b\u3009;\u03bb)U\u03bb and L(T (1) l |b\u3009;\u03bb) be denoted by L(t) and L(t+ d\u03b4),\nrespectively, where d = d1 = ( \u220f4 \u03b1=1 e (\u03b1) L\u22121) 1/4 and l = \u03b44. Assume that the condition e (\u03b1) L = 1 is satisfied for all \u03b1, and that the eigenvalues of the matrix L(|b\u3009; l) for sufficiently small l\u2019s are given the expansion (62). Then, the discrete time Lax equation (44) reduces to the continuous time Lax equation (27) in the limit \u03b4 \u2192 0. Proof. By using the expression (66), we obtain\nL(t+ d\u03b4) = (U\u22121\u03bb g(v, \u03b44;\u03bb))\u22121L(t)(U\u22121\u03bb g(v, \u03b44;\u03bb)) = L(t) + d\u03b4 \u00b7 [L(t),Z] +O ( \u03b42 ) ,\nfrom equation (58), which was equivalent to equation (44). Hence the assertion of the\ntheorem follows."

            "text": "The discussions for deriving the Lax equations in the previous two subsections can be\ngeneralized to those for derivations of equations (1) and (24). Consider the following\nmatrix equation\ng(b, s;\u03bb)g(a, l;\u03bb) = g(a\u2032, l;\u03bb)g(b\u2032, s;\u03bb). (67)\nFor any s, l \u2208 R>0 and (a,b) \u2208 (R>0)6, there is a unique solution (a\u2032,b\u2032) \u2208 (R>0)6 to this matrix equation. Let R(s,l) : (R>0)\n6 \u2192 (R>0)6 be a rational map given by R(s,l) : (b, a) 7\u2192 (a\u2032,b\u2032). This is the geometric R-matrix in the present case. An explicit expression for the rational map is written as\na\u2032(1) = a(1) a(2)a(3)a(4) + a(2)a(3)b(1) + a(2)b(4)b(1) + b(3)b(4)b(1)\na(1)a(2)a(3) + a(1)a(2)b(4) + a(1)b(3)b(4) + b(2)b(3)b(4) ,\na\u2032(2) = a(2) a(3)a(4)a(1) + a(3)a(4)b(2) + a(3)b(1)b(2) + b(4)b(1)b(2)\na(2)a(3)a(4) + a(2)a(3)b(1) + a(2)b(4)b(1) + b(3)b(4)b(1) ,\na\u2032(3) = a(3) a(4)a(1)a(2) + a(4)a(1)b(3) + a(4)b(2)b(3) + b(1)b(2)b(3)\na(3)a(4)a(1) + a(3)a(4)b(2) + a(3)b(1)b(2) + b(4)b(1)b(2) ,\nand b\u2032(i) = a(i)b(i)/a\u2032(i) [29]. Let the map R(s,l) : (b, a) 7\u2192 (a\u2032,b\u2032) be depicted as\na\u2032 b\nb\u2032 a .\nThen the solution of equation (40) satisfies the relations in the diagram\nv\nb1\nb\u20321\nv2\nb2\nb\u20322\nv3 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 vL\u22121 bL\u22121\nb\u2032L\u22121\nvL\nbL\nb\u2032L\nv,\n(68)\nwhere vi\u2019s are defined by the downward recursion relation R (s,l)(bi,vi+1) = (vi,b \u2032 i) with the initial condition vL+1 = v, where v is determined by the Perron-Frobenius eigenvector of the monodromy matrix M (1) l (|b\u3009) as described in \u00a74.1. As in \u00a72.2 let \u03c3 denote the cyclic shift to the left, so we have \u03c3|b\u3009 = (b2, . . . ,bL,b1). It is easy to see that an obvious generalization of equation (44) is\nL(T (1)l (\u03c3i\u22121|b\u3009);\u03bb) = g(vi, l;\u03bb)\u22121L(\u03c3i\u22121|b\u3009;\u03bb)g(vi, l;\u03bb). (69)\nThis equation implies that vi can also be obtained in the same way as for v in \u00a74.1, by simply replacing M (1) l (|b\u3009) by M (1) l (\u03c3\ni\u22121|b\u3009). Based on this fact, one can generalize equation (51) as\n\u03b4 \u00b7 g(vi, 1/\u03b44;\u03bb) = I4 + \u03b4 \u00b7 Yi +O ( \u03b42 ) , (70)\nwhere Yi is a matrix of the form (10) with n = 4, p = 1, and equation (66) as\nU\u22121\u03bb g(vi, \u03b4 4;\u03bb) = I4 + d1\u03b4 \u00b7 Zi +O\n( \u03b42 ) , (71)\nwhere Zi is a matrix of the form (29) with n = 4. First we consider type I case, where l = 1/\u03b44. Around each vertex in the diagram\n(68) we have the relation\ng(b\u2032i, s;\u03bb) = (\u03b4 \u00b7 g(vi, l;\u03bb))\u22121g(bi, s;\u03bb)(\u03b4 \u00b7 g(vi+1, l;\u03bb)).\nThen by setting\nMi(t+ \u03b4) = g(b\u2032i, s;\u03bb), Mi(t) = g(bi, s;\u03bb),\nand using (70), we can derive equation (11) in the limit \u03b4 \u2192 0. Second we consider type II case, where l = \u03b44, s = 1, and with the condition e (\u03b1) L = 1 for all \u03b1. As in the previous case, we have the relation\ng(b\u2032i, 1;\u03bb) = (U \u22121 \u03bb g(vi, l;\u03bb)) \u22121(U\u22121\u03bb g(bi, 1;\u03bb)U\u03bb)(U \u22121 \u03bb g(vi+1, l;\u03bb)).\nThen by setting\nMi(t+ d1\u03b4) = g(b\u2032i, 1;\u03bb), Mi(t) = U\u22121\u03bb g(bi, 1;\u03bb)U\u03bb,\nand using (71), we can derive equation (30) in the limit \u03b4 \u2192 0. Finally, we conclude that equations (1) for p = 1 and (24) are derived from the\nclosed geometric crystal chains by the above arguments and using Propositions 2 and\n8, respectively."

            "text": "In order to avoid a potential confusion, we present a discussion to illustrate the\ndifference between the closed geometric crystal chain and another discrete dynamical\nsystem in reference [12], which is also defined by using the geometric R matrix.\nFirst we consider the closed geometric crystal chain. Let R(s,l) : (R>0) 2(n\u22121) \u2192\n(R>0) 2(n\u22121) be a rational map that is essentially the same one in \u00a74.4 but the condition n = 4 has been generalized to for an arbitrary positive integer n \u2265 2. Let R\n(s,l) i be a map from (R>0) (L+1)(n\u22121) = (R>0) n\u22121 \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 (R>0)n\u22121 to itself, which acts as the map R(s,l) on factors i and i + 1, and as the identity on the other factors. We define R(s,l) = R(s,l)1 \u25e6 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u25e6 R (s,l) L , which are maps from (R>0) (L+1)(n\u22121) to itself. Then the diagram (68) for general n implies that we have the relation R(s,l)(b1, . . . ,bL,v) = (v,b\u20321, . . . ,b\u2032L), which enables us to define the time evolution T\n(1) l : (R>0) (n\u22121)L \u2192 (R>0)(n\u22121)L and to obtain its Lax representation, in the same way as in (43) and (44), respectively. The above v is determined by the PerronFrobenius eigenvector of the monodromy matrix M (1) l (|b\u3009) as in the case of n = 4 in \u00a74.1. The commutativity of the time evolutions T (1) l1 \u25e6 T (1)l2 = T (1) l2\n\u25e6 T (1)l1 is satisfied for any l1, l2 \u2208 R>0, as a consequence of the fact that the maps R(s,l)i are obeying the Yang-Baxter relation R\n(s,l2) i+1 R (s,l1) i R (l2,l1) i+1 = R (l2,l1) i R (s,l1) i+1 R (s,l2) i and the involution\nR (l2,l1) L+1 \u25e6R (l1,l2) L+1 = Id. The Lax equation (44) implies that the characteristic polynomial of the matrix L(|b\u3009;\u03bb) in (41) is invariant under the actions of the time evolutions T\n(1) l s for any l \u2208 R>0, hence its coefficients are the conserved quantities of the closed\ngeometric crystal chain.\nSecond we consider the discrete dynamical system in [12], but slightly modified to\nbe consistent with the notations used in this paper. In this case, we choose the values of the parameter s attached to each site unequally. So let |s\u3009 = (s1, . . . , sL) and define L(|b\u3009, |s\u3009;\u03bb) to be the matrix\nL(|b\u3009, |s\u3009;\u03bb) = g(b1, s1;\u03bb) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 g(bL, sL;\u03bb), (72)\nwhich is called a Lax matrix. As in the previous paragraph, let R (si,si+1) i be a map from (R>0) (L+1)(n\u22121) = (R>0)\nn\u22121 \u00d7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00d7 (R>0)n\u22121 to itself, which acts as the map R(si,si+1) on factors i and i + 1, and as the identity on the other factors. More precisely, the map R (si,si+1) i acts on the set (Y1)\nL. Applied to (|b\u3009, |s\u3009) \u2208 (Y1)L, it sends |b\u3009 = (b1, . . . ,bi,bi+1, . . . ,bL) to (b1, . . . ,b\u2032i+1,b\u2032i, . . . ,bL) where (b\u2032i+1,b\u2032i) = R(si,si+1)(bi,bi+1), and |s\u3009 = (s1, . . . , si, si+1, . . . , sL) to (s1, . . . , si+1, si, . . . , sL). Let Yi (1 \u2264 i \u2264 L) be the map defined by\nYi = R (si+1,si) i \u25e6 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u25e6R (sL,si) L\u22121 \u25e6 \u03c3 \u25e6R (s1,si) 1 \u25e6 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u25e6R (si\u22121,si) i\u22121 ,\nwhere \u03c3 denotes the cyclic shift to the left. If viewed as a map on the set (Y1) L, it does not change |s\u3009 = (s1, . . . , sL). So it can be simply regarded as a map on the set (R>0) (L+1)(n\u22121) and the relation Yi|b\u3009 = |b\u2032\u3009 can be described by the following diagram\nv1\nb1\nb\u20321\nv2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 bi\u22121\nb\u2032i\u22121\nvi\nbi\nb\u2032i\nvi+1\nbi+1\nb\u2032i+1\n\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 vL bL\nb\u2032L\nv1.\nThe commutativity of the rational maps Yi\u25e6Yj = Yj \u25e6Yi is satisfied for any 1 \u2264 i, j \u2264 L. It is proved by using the property of the maps R\n(s,l) i obeying the Yang-Baxter relation,\nand it also reflects the fact that the Yis for 1 \u2264 i \u2264 L \u2212 1 can be interpreted as generators of the translation subgroup of the extended affine Weyl group W\u0303 (A\n(1) L\u22121) [12].\nThe commutativity of this type of transfer maps defined as a composition of general\nYang-Baxter maps was discussed in [28], where its original idea was attributed to a\nresult in the classical paper [30] by C. N. Yang. Following this historical background,\nwe shall call the discrete dynamical system described by this set of rational maps\nYi a birational Yang\u2019s system, because its tropical counterpart was referred to as a combinatorial Yang\u2019s system [16] by the same reason.\nIn order to see a Lax representation of this system, we consider the map YL. Let\nYL|b\u3009 = |b\u0303\u3009 = (b\u03031, . . . , b\u0303L). Then we have\ng(b1, s1;\u03bb) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 g(bL, sL;\u03bb) = g(b\u0303L, sL;\u03bb)g(b\u03031, s1;\u03bb) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 g(b\u0303L\u22121, sL\u22121;\u03bb). (73)\nComparing this with equation (72), we obtain the relation\nL(YL|b\u3009, |s\u3009;\u03bb) = g(b\u0303L, sL;\u03bb)\u22121L(|b\u3009, |s\u3009;\u03bb)g(b\u0303L, sL;\u03bb), (74)\nwhich can be regarded as a Lax equation. By applying the cyclic shift operator \u03c3\nrepeatedly, one can obtain Lax representations for all the other time evolutions Yi. Therefore, the characteristic polynomial of the matrix L(|b\u3009, |s\u3009;\u03bb) is invariant under the actions of the time evolutions Yis for any 1 \u2264 i \u2264 L, because it is common to that of L(\u03c3i|b\u3009, \u03c3i|s\u3009;\u03bb) for all i\u2019s. Hence its coefficients are the conserved quantities of the birational Yang\u2019s system.\nFor the closed geometric crystal chain, the Lax matrix L(|b\u3009;\u03bb) is independent of the parameter l, which is in the companion matrix g(v, l;\u03bb) of the Lax pair in equation\n(44). Therefore, without changing the Lax matrix, one can consider the limit for taking l \u2192 \u221e and that for l \u2192 0 in equation (44) to obtain the continuous time Lax equations. As a result, we were able to obtain integrable differential equations that share a Lax\nmatrix in common with a discrete dynamical system, at least for the cases treated in \u00a74. In contrast, for the birational Yang\u2019s system, the Lax matrix L(|b\u3009, |s\u3009;\u03bb) depends on the same parameter sL in common with the companion matrix g(b\u0303L, sL;\u03bb) of the Lax pair in equation (74). Therefore, one can not apply the same method to take the\ncontinuum limits. However, it seems reasonable to expect that a generalization of the\nsymmetric form of the Painleve\u0301 equations PIV and PV in [22], which is also regarded as a variation of extended Lotka-Volterra systems, can be obtained from this discrete\ndynamical system by taking a continuum limit through a similar method."

As in equation (46), suppose that the eigenvalues \u03b7q (q \u2208 Z/nZ) of the Lax matrix L(|b\u3009; l) for sufficiently large l\u2019s are given by the Puiseux series expansion\n\u03b7q = l \u03ba\n\u221e\u2211\nm=\u22121\ncm exp\n( 2\u03c0 \u221a \u22121mq n ) l\u2212m/n,\nwhere c\u22121 = 1 and c0 = ( \u2211n \u03b1=1 e (\u03b1) 1 )/n. This implies that the eigenvalues \u03b7 \u2032 q (q \u2208 Z/nZ) of the matrix L(|b\u3009;\u2212l) are given by\n\u03b7\u2032q = (\u2212l)\u03ba \u221e\u2211\nm=\u22121\ncm exp\n( \u03c0 \u221a \u22121m(2q \u2212 1)\nn\n) l\u2212m/n.\nBy the above relation between g\u2217(x, s;\u03bb) and g(x, s; (\u22121)n\u03bb), we see that the largest eigenvalue of the monodromy matrix M\n(1) l (|b\u3009), which is defined similarly by equation\n(42) for general n, is given by E = ( \u220fn\nq=1 \u03b7q)/\u03b7n/2 for the case of even n, or by\nE = ( \u220fn\nq=1 \u03b7 \u2032 q)/\u03b7 \u2032 (n+1)/2 for the case of odd n. In both cases, the asymptotic form\nof E is given by\nE = l(n\u22121)\u03ba+ n\u22121 n + c0l (n\u22121)\u03ba+n\u22122 n + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 .\nTo summarize, depending on whether n is even or odd, we have to pay an attention to the choice of the sign of the loop parameter in the matrix L(|b\u3009; (\u22121)nl) for obtaining the largest eigenvalue of the monodromy matrix M\n(1) l (|b\u3009).\nIt also seems that the derivation is not restricted to the totally one-row tableaux\ncase but can be generalized to the rectangular tableaux cases in \u00a73.2 of [26], which\nuses the description of the geometric R-matrices in reference [5]. In this case, to define another time evolution T (k) l we use the monodromy matrix M (k) l (|b\u3009) for a k -row tableau \u201ccarrier\u201d, and the entries of this matrix are order n \u2212 k minors of the Lax matrix L(|b\u3009; (\u22121)n\u2212k\u22121l) with such a prescribed sign of the loop parameter (\u00a73.2.5 of [26]). Therefore, an additional attention to the choice of the sign of the loop parameter must be payed for considering its largest eigenvalue E = E (k) l . For instance, in the case of k = 2, the largest eigenvalue of the monodromy matrix M (2) l (|b\u3009) is given by E = ( \u220fn q=1 \u03b7 \u2032 q)/(\u03b7 \u2032 n/2\u03b7 \u2032 n/2+1) for the case of even n, or by\nE = ( \u220fn\nq=1 \u03b7q)/(\u03b7(n\u22121)/2\u03b7(n+1)/2) for the case of odd n.\nAnyway, we hope that we can report a result for such cases in the near future."
