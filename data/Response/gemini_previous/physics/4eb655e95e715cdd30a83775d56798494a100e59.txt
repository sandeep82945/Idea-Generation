1. **Investigate the in vitro and in vivo efficacy of the proposed CAII inhibitor drugs:** Conduct laboratory experiments to assess the potency and selectivity of the proposed drugs against CAII and other carbonic anhydrase isoforms. Evaluate their ability to lower intraocular pressure in animal models of glaucoma.


2. **Explore the pharmacokinetic and toxicological properties of the proposed drugs:** Determine the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) profile of the drugs in animal models. Assess their potential for drug-drug interactions and identify any potential toxic effects.


3. **Investigate the structure-activity relationship (SAR) of the proposed drugs:** Synthesize and evaluate a series of analogs of the proposed drugs with different functional groups and substituents. Determine the impact of these modifications on the drugs' binding affinity, potency, and selectivity for CAII.


4. **Explore the potential of the proposed drugs for combination therapy:** Investigate the potential of combining the proposed drugs with other antiglaucoma medications, such as beta-blockers, prostaglandin analogs, or miotics. Assess the efficacy and safety of these combinations in animal models of glaucoma.


5. **Investigate the potential of the proposed drugs for the treatment of other diseases:** Explore the potential of the proposed drugs for the treatment of other diseases associated with CAII activity, such as epilepsy, altitude sickness, or cancer. Evaluate their efficacy and safety in relevant animal models.
