Extension to Other Art Forms: Investigate the application of SVD entropy and Shannon information quantity measurements to other forms of art beyond paintings, such as sculptures, installations, and digital art. This research could explore how the three-dimensional characteristics of sculptures or the interactive elements of installations affect their information quantity and, consequently, their valuation in the art market.

Cross-Cultural Comparisons: Conduct a cross-cultural study to examine how perceptions of information quantity in artworks differ across cultures and how these perceptions influence art pricing globally. This could involve comparing Western and Eastern art markets or analyzing the valuation of indigenous art forms in different regions, taking into consideration cultural differences in interpreting artwork content.

Emotional Impact and Art Valuation: Delve deeper into the relationship between the emotional impact of an artwork's colors and its sales price, building on the color-emotion-investment transmission mechanism. This could involve psychological experiments to measure viewers' emotional responses to artworks with varying levels of SVD entropy and analyzing how these responses correlate with the artworks' market value.

Temporal Analysis of Art Pricing Trends: Perform a longitudinal study to track changes in the significance of SVD entropy in art pricing over time. This research could investigate whether the importance of information quantity in determining artwork prices has evolved with changes in art market dynamics, digital accessibility, and collector preferences.

Machine Learning Models for Art Valuation: Develop advanced machine learning models that incorporate SVD entropy along with other artwork characteristics to predict art prices more accurately. This could also involve creating models that can classify artworks into price ranges based on their information quantity and other features, providing tools for collectors, investors, and galleries to make informed decisions.
