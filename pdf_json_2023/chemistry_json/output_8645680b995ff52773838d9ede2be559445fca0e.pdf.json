    "abstractText": "This study focuses on selected members of the general salen-analogues family possessing two O-H\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7N hydrogen bonds, namely three isomers of N,N\u2019-bis(salicylidene)-X-phenylenediamine, denoted as ortho, meta and para. Two of the isomers are not planar in the published crystal structures. The current study tackles the problem of symmetry and interactions within the molecules, as well as in the crystal lattice. The aromaticity of the phenyl rings is evaluated using the Harmonic Oscillator Model of Aromaticity (HOMA) index. Intraand inter-molecular non-covalent interactions are studied via Hirshfeld surface analysis, Independent Gradient Model (IGM), Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM), Non-Covalent Interaction (NCI) index, Electron Localisation Function (ELF), Core-Valence Bifurcation (CVB) index and Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT). Density Functional Theory (DFT) simulations were carried out in vacuo and with solvent reaction field based on Polarisable Continuum Model (IEF-PCM formulation) at the \u03c9B97XD/6-311+G(2d,2p) level. Crystal structure analyses were performed for the data reported previously in the literature. The obtained results demonstrate that the three isomers differ greatly in their structural properties (molecular symmetry is broken for the ortho and meta isomers in the solid state) and ability to form intermolecular interactions, while retaining overall similar physico-chemical characteristics, e.g., aromaticity of the phenyl rings. It was found that the presence of the polar solvent does not significantly affect the structure of the studied compounds. An application of the Hirshfeld surface analysis revealed the nature of the non-covalent interactions present in the investigated crystals. The SAPT results showed that the stability of the dimers extracted from the crystals of the Schiff base derivatives arises from electrostatics and dispersion.",

            "text": "Schiff bases are a group of organic compounds for which the defining characteristic is the presence of a double bond between nitrogen and carbon atoms, R1R2N = CR3 [1]. This feature places them in the broader imine group. According to the IUPAC definition, the specific attribute of Schiff bases is that the carbon and nitrogen atoms are attached to alkyl or aryl groups, not to the hydrogen atoms (R 6= H) [2]. The history of Schiff bases discovery began in Italy, where Hugo Schiff conducted numerous condensation reactions of aniline with aldehydes, e.g., acetaldehyde, valeraldehyde, benzaldehyde and cinnamaldehyde. The formation of new compounds, imines, was described for the first time in the paper entitled \u2018Eine neue Reihe organischer Basen (A New Series of Organic Bases)\u2019 [1,3]. Over the years, Schiff bases have gained significance in various areas of science such as organic synthesis, material science, catalysis and biochemistry [4\u201311]. An interesting example of applications development is provided by the macrocyclic Schiff bases, which were accidentally discovered by Curtis in 1961 while studying nickel ions and diamines [12]. Yellow crystals formed in the experiment were confirmed to be complex compounds of\nSymmetry 2023, 15, 424. https://doi.org/10.3390/sym15020424 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/symmetry\nnickel ions coordinated by macrocycles. The reaction was possible due to the presence of acetone which undergoes the condensation with 1,2-ethanediamine [12]. To this day, the macrocyclic chemistry of Schiff bases is in constant development [13] due to their ability to coordinate a large number of different species, such as metal ions or small chemical compounds. It is also possible to design host compounds, which are able to selectively coordinate guest molecules [14], by use of chiral components (e.g., chiral diamines) or by controlling the size of the macrocycles [13]. Schiff base ligands are able to coordinate metal ions either by the imine nitrogen, another atom (which usually comes from the aldehyde fragment), or even both. Schiff bases retain their relevance to this day, especially are considered the so called \u2019privileged ligands\u2019 [15]. In fact, they are able to stabilise many different metals in various oxidation states, controlling their performance in a variety of useful catalytic transformations [16\u201318]. Dendrimeric complexes of iron coordinated by Schiff bases can exhibit mesophase behaviour and variable high vs. low spin composition [19]. Azomethines, a specific subset of Schiff bases (often considered synonymous) [2], are also known for their ability to catalyse redox reactions, e.g., copper(I) complexes for the selective oxidation of primary alcohols to aldehydes under ambient conditions [20] or the electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 to formate by an iron complex [21]. Both macrocyclic and multidentate Schiff base ligands and their derivatives may also find applications in the field of medicine and drug development. Their complexes with metal ions (mostly Co, Ni, Zn) show promising properties as, e.g., anticancer agents [22]. In addition, the aforementioned ability of enantioselective Schiff bases synthesis is crucial in drug development. Their bioactivity and specificity can be improved through changes in their three-dimensional conformation (by, e.g., introduction of suitable substituents), which can result in increasingly effective and safer drugs. The chirality of the compounds translates into greater complexity, which in turn results in a lower probability of interaction with inappropriate molecular targets [23]. In this work three isomeric Schiff bases from salen analogues group (see Figure 1) are presented. They are the ortho, meta and para isomers of the N,N\u2019-bis-(salicylidene)-Xphenylenediamine. These compounds contain a benzene-(1,2 or 1,3 or 1,4)-diamine bridge, which replaces more conformationally flexible ethylenediamine characteristic for salens. The middle fragment (M) is substituted by two outer phenyl groups bonded to hydroxyl groups (A and B) that come from salicylic aldehyde [24]. The hydroxyl groups are in the positions enabling the formation of intramolecular hydrogen bonds (HB) with imine nitrogen atoms (Figure 1). Hydrogen bond is classified as a non-covalent interaction occurring between a hydrogen atom (bonded to an electronegative atom X, called \u2019donor atom\u2019) and a Y atom, which has a lone electron pair (called \u2019acceptor atom\u2019). This forms a three-component X-H\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7Y system, sometimes called a hydrogen bridge. Due to the type of the X atom (most commonly oxygen or nitrogen), electrons in the X-H bond are strongly shifted towards the former and the partial charges are formed: negative on X atom and positive on the hydrogen atom. This dipole interacts with a Y atom through a hydrogen atom and the HB is formed [25,26]. The influence of this interaction is strictly connected both with the character of HB (inter- or intramolecular [27]), strength [28,29], symmetry [30]) and other molecular properties (e.g., functional groups and their position [31]). In some conditions, proton transfers phenomenon between the donor and acceptor atoms can be observed [32,33], resulting in X\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7H-Y formation (called proton-transferred form). HB properties can be modulated by many factors, such as changes in the conformation of compounds or the electron density of aromatic rings, which can result from, e.g., introduction of substituents (steric and inductive effects) [34]. Analysis of these changes can be crucial for understanding the action of salen analogues as ligands [24]. It is also worth noting that the symmetry of ligands or complexes (which are susceptible to change through mechanisms such as those described above) is of great importance in modern chemistry. Symmetry influences catalytic reaction paths [35], can modulate bioavailability of drugs [36,37] or can even be of high importance in developing quantum bits [38] used in quantum computers. Schiff bases\nare excellent systems for basic studies and applications of externally induced symmetry changes. For example, they undergo not only cis-trans photoisomerisation, but also preferential molecular reorientation in a polarised light, which can be demonstrated, e.g., on Au nanoparticles and in protein binding pockets [39,40].\nThe main aim of the current study is dedicated to the intra- and inter-molecular noncovalent interactions investigations in the isomeric forms of selected Schiff bases. We analysed the crystal structures of the compounds, as well as we employed Density Functional Theory (DFT) method [41,42] for energy minimisation in vacuo and with implicit solvation model (IEF-PCM formulation) [43]. In particular, our attention was focused on: (i) changes in metric parameters associated with different states of aggregation; (ii) non-covalent interactions in molecular crystals; (iii) aromaticity changes in the studied compounds; (iv) topology and electronic structure changes and (v) energy decomposition in the crystal structure of the selected dimers. We present the transition from single molecules through dimers to molecular crystals by analysing the various factors responsible for self-organisation. Changes in the symmetry of the molecules associated with the presence of HBs in the molecules studied were also taken into account."

The computed geometric parameters with respect to experimental data are presented in Tables 2 and 3. The quasi-ring bond lengths analysis showed that the \u03c9B97XD/6-311+G(2d,2p) level of theory was able to reproduce correctly the selected metric parameters. The crystallographic data were taken as a reference. When discussing the bond lengths within the hydrogen bridge, the differences of around 5% are present across all of the studied compounds. This difference may be due to the fact that experimental data indicate an O-H bond length of less than 1 \u00c5 in two of the studied compounds. However, the largest difference between the crystal structure and the computed one is ca. 0.15 \u00c5 and it is associated with the metric parameters of the hydrogen bridge. The discrepancies between the crystal and computational data are mostly related to the positions of hydrogen atoms. This is not unexpected due to the well-known problems with location of hydrogen atoms in the electron density maps in the process of structure refinement. The deviations regarding heavy atom positions are much smaller.\n1 Crystal Form 1, CCDC code: 1226150 [45], 2 Crystal Form 1, CCDC code: 828843 [46], 3 CCDC code: 962961 [47], 4 The same bond length values for both A and B rings of molecular form (point symmetry in all para systems).\nThe analysis of valence and dihedral angles enabled us to discuss the symmetry changes of the studied Schiff bases when crystal data, DFT-based results in vacuo and with the application of the PCM were compared. The first significant symmetry breaking can be found in the valence angles of ortho and meta compounds, especially in the former. It is evident that the side rings of the compounds are not equal, with one experiencing more open angles (especially in OA-5A-6A to OB-5B-6B comparison to the ortho compound). This suggests that the structures are not ideally comparable, and they can be subjected to some altered interactions. Similarly, the dihedral angles within the quasi-rings are different when comparing crystal data and DFT results for ortho and meta Schiff bases derivatives. This is also, and to the largest extent, visible in the dihedral angle describing the side-group planar rotation. All of the inequalities between side groups are not at all present in the para compound, where the molecule is almost entirely planar in the crystal. The only major difference between crystal data and the DFT results is the dihedral angle denoting the planar rotation\nof the side rings\u2014in DFT they are rotated out of plane, while in crystal the molecule is almost ideally planar. The entirety of the observations are reflected in Figure 2.\n1 Crystal Form 1, CCDC code: 1226150 [45], 2 Crystal Form 1, CCDC code: 828843 [46], 3 CCDC code: 962961 [47], 4 The same angular values for both A and B rings of molecular form (point symmetry in all para systems).\nTo further accentuate the observations, the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) analysis was performed for the investigated Schiff base derivatives. The obtained values are presented in Table 4.\nBoth ortho and meta compounds exhibit major symmetry breaks in the crystal, while in DFT both of these compounds are symmetrical. The situation is different for the para compound\u2014it remains symmetrical in all studied cases, even though some of the geometrical features are different. This results in the GP-to-crystal RMSD values of 1.640, 1.405 and 0.456 for ortho, meta and para, respectively. The interactions within the molecules describing these changes, as well as intermolecular ones, is discussed in later sections. As a final step in the geometrical analysis, the HOMA index for the side rings was calculated and is presented in Table 5. The Ropt for the structures from DFT calculations was assumed as 1.388 \u00c5 [58], and for the solid state as 1.378 \u00c5, consistent with the C-C bond length in benzene measured at \u22123 \u25e6C [59].\nThe HOMA index values confirm that the side rings in the DFT calculations retain equal aromaticity. However, the aromaticity differences were noted in the crystal structures. The rings in the planar fragments of studied molecules showed higher aromaticity."

            "text": "Intermolecular contacts were investigated with Hirshfeld surface analysis [60]. The surface is composed of the points where a central molecule has an equal electron density contribution to the other molecules in the supercell (based on promolecular density). The isosurface components are: de\u2014distance from the closest external atomic nucleus to the surface and di\u2014distance from the closest internal nucleus to the surface and van der Waals radii. They form the basis of normalised contact distance (dnorm), which is presented using red\u2013white\u2013blue colour pattern on the Hirshfeld maps in Figure 3. White dots represent Van der Waals contact distances. Red dots represent dnorm negative values, which correspond to distances shorter than vdW interactions. Blue dots mark positive values of dnorm and contacts longer than vdW interactions. In Figure 3 it is clear that values of dnorm are mostly negative. They indicate close intermolecular contacts and imply evident interactions. This is a result of the tight packing of molecules in the crystal unit cell. In the para compound, the values of dnorm are the most extreme among the studied compounds. It is the effect of the highly ordered arrangement of the crystal structure. Meta and ortho compounds are not planar, and this results in less tightly packed crystal structure. However, due to the presence of the planar fragment in the ortho molecule and stacking interactions, the structure is more organised and more short-distance contacts are indicated. Contribution of different types of interactions (H\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7H , C\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7C , O\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7H/H\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7O , C\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7H/H\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7C) in the total contact Hirshfeld surface was studied via the fingerprint analysis [61]. The results are presented in Table 6, Figure 4 and in Supplementary Material: Figures S1\u2013S2. Fingerprint plots are created by binning de and di pairs in the intervals of 0.01 \u00c5 and colouring each bin of the resulting 2D histogram as a function of the fraction of surface points in that bin. This ranges from purple (few points), through green, to yellow (many points). Due to their implementation, it was possible to recognise and characterise crucial intermolecular contacts in the studied compounds. In the crystal structure of the para compound short-distance interactions originate mostly from strong stacking interactions of the aromatic rings between planar layers. This corresponds well with a significantly higher share of the C\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7C contacts in para when compared to the meta and ortho. On the fingerprint plots in Figure 4 it is also evident that a large number of C\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7C interactions are located within a relatively small space. Different effects are present in the meta isomer crystal. The molecules are not planar and the molecule organisation pattern is based on C\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7H/H\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7C contacts. The corresponding fingerprint areas are spreading and intense and their contribution to total contact surface is high. The ortho compound crystal structure is the most complex. The fingerprint analysis revealed that the C\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7C and C\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7H/H\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7C interactions have almost equal contributions to the stabilisation. It is possible due to the presence within ortho molecules both planar and rotated side rings. The former create stacking interactions, similar to the para isomer,\nand the latter are mostly involved in C\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7H/H\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7C contacts. It is worth noting that the O\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7H/H\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7O interactions are relevant in all of the studied crystal structures. Their involvement in stabilising the structure is comparable among different isomers and is tabulated in Table 6.\nThe characterisation of the contacts stabilising the crystal structure is further complemented by the use of the Independent Gradient Model (IGM) to study intermolecular interactions in all types of ortho, meta and para dimers from crystals of the Schiff base derivatives [62]. The IGM analysis allows for investigation of non-covalent interactions on the basis of the sum of spherically averaged neutral atomic densities. The core of the method is a 3D real space function, called \u03b4g, which presents a unique definition of the interaction region. It can be expanded as the difference between the sum over the absolute value of the electron density gradient of each atom in the analysed fragment (gIGM) and the summarised electron density gradient of each investigated atom (g). When \u03b4g related to intermolecular interactions is combined with the electron density multiplied by the sign of the second Hessian eigenvalue (sign(\u03bb2)\u03c1), both: regions of the weak interaction occurrence, as well as their nature and strength, can be characterised. The interactions in the studied dimers are depicted in Figure 5 as the scatter graphs and in Figure 6 as the 3D gradient isosurfaces, where the blue, green and red regions represent attraction, Van der Waals interaction and repulsion, respectively. Figure 6 presents the structures of the studied dimers with the IGM gradient isosurfaces represented in green. Intermolecular stability in crystals shows significant differences when comparing the isomer to isomer. The relatively simplest is the para isomer\u2014most of the stabilisation comes from the stacking of multiple molecular fragments between layers, with additional term brought from longer-range O\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7H and H\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7H interaction between the orthogonal planes. When analysing the scatter graphs, it is evident that the stacking interactions provide stronger stabilisation due to their accumulation and proximity of the molecules. This further confirms observations from the Hirshfeld surfaces, and is strongly related to the planar nature of the molecule. The more intricate effects can be found in the meta isomer. The meta compound does not have a typical \u2019layered\u2019 dimer. Stabilisation is ensured via C(Ph)\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7H interactions and a special H(1)\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7O(2)\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7H(1) triangular system, where the\nnumber in brackets denotes the molecule within the dimer the atom is from. This ternary intermolecular entity acts as a counterpart of the stacking interactions\u2014the meta molecules in the crystal are not planar, as in para. Examination of the scatter graphs indicates that the H\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7O\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7H interactions acquire a significantly stronger attractive character on the side of the rotated side ring in dimer 1. This is the result of cooperation of the H\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7O\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7H and parallel-displaced stacking interactions. The ortho isomer is most elaborate as it has three types of dimers. Dimer 1 is showing stacking interactions between the planar parts of the molecules, with some additional O\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7H and C-H\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7H-C contributions. Dimer 2 is stabilised by the (C)Ph\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7H interaction and the ternary H(1)\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7O(2)\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7H(1) system. Dimer 3 is the most interesting of the three\u2014the two molecules have the planar parts in plane but with opposite turns, and the rotated side rings are out of plane, in close proximity to the planar side rings. The latter are stabilised via the H(1)\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7O(2)\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7H(1) triangles, while the former form even more elaborate, quaternary system O(1)\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7H(2)\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7H(1)\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7O(2). Similarly to meta, ortho molecules in the crystal are not planar, yet retain some planar stacking in para. Scatter graphs suggest the strongest attractive character of the H\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7O\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7H interactions appear in dimer 1. It may be concluded that it is due to the strong cooperation of interactions, as is the case of the meta isomer. This phenomenon does not occur in dimer 3 and only Van der Waals interaction are observed. Results of IGM analysis are consistent with the ones obtained from the Hirshfeld surfaces and together form a comprehensive description of intermolecular interactions between the molecules."

            "text": "Intramolecular interactions in DFT-based structures in vacuo and in the PCM were studied using Quantum Theory of Atoms in Molecules (QTAIM) combined with NonCovalent Interactions (NCI) index [51,52]. QTAIM theory describes bonding in a molecule by characterising stationary points of the electron density field, called Bond Critical Points (BCP), Ring Critical Points (RCPs), Cage Critical Points (CCPs) and connections between them, named bond paths. For each of them, both the exact location and electronic structure properties are determined. The combination of QTAIM and NCI analyses allow not only to identify the bonding pattern in a molecule, but also to explore additional weak interactions and describe their nature and strength. The NCI index is based on electron density and employs the dependence between Reduced Density Gradient (RDG) and the electron density multiplied by the sign of the second Hessian eigenvalue (sign(\u03bb2)\u03c1). When sign(\u03bb2)\u03c1 takes the value lower than 0, it implies molecular attraction. When sign(\u03bb2)\u03c1 \u2248 0, Van der Waals interactions are denoted and finally the value sign(\u03bb2)\u03c1 higher than 0 stands for molecular repulsion. Figure 7 presents the results of the NCI and AIM topological analyses for the studied compounds in vacuo. The results for the PCM can be found in Supplementary Material: Figure S3. In all of the presented structures, the yellow lines indicate the intramolecular interaction paths, while the yellow and orange dots mark the Ring Critical Points (RCPs) and Bond Critical Points (BCPs), respectively. Red regions\u2014intramolecular repulsion, blue\u2014attraction and green\u2014Van der Waals interactions. As evident from Figure 7 in all of the studied compounds, the hydrogen bridges with their neighbouring atoms constitute distinct quasi-rings. This is indicated by both the isosurfaces from the NCI analysis, as well as the RCPs from the QTAIM analysis. Such insights are well established in the literature [76]. Additionally, the ortho compound has an additional, macro-ring located in between the side wings. This is indicated by the distinctive NCI pattern of repulsion and vdW interactions, as well as the presence of RCP located on the O\u2013O axis. These specific interactions in the ortho isomer significantly affect the NCI scatter plots, presented in Figure 8 and in Supplementary Material: Figure S4. Additional green and red regions correspond to vdW and steric interactions are observed. It is also worth noting that the inclusion of PCM does not change the results significantly. The O\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7O distance is 3.523 \u00c5 in the experimental structure, 3.721 \u00c5 in the GP and 3.520 \u00c5 in the PCM model. Thus, the presence of the macrocyclic ring involving the O\u2013O axis is expected in the crystal structure as well.\nQTAIM theory provides meaningful information of intramolecular hydrogen bonding present in the studied compounds. HBs constitute the essential part of the molecular structure and geometry. Investigating electronic properties at BCPs between atoms involved in the hydrogen bridge demonstrated differences among studied isomers. The results for all of the compounds obtained in vacuo are presented in Table 7 and in Supplementary Material: Table S1 for the structures computed in PCM. For the covalent O\u2014H bonds absolute values of the electron density, its Laplacians and the density of potential energy decrease in the following order: ortho > meta > para . The opposite effect is observed for the H\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7N in the hydrogen bond. Each of the above-mentioned absolute values at BCPs increase from ortho to para isomer. It is therefore clear that HBs in the investigated compounds have the following relations regarding HB strength:\n(i) HB in the ortho isomer is significantly weaker than the corresponding bonds in meta and para, (ii) in the para isomer HBs are the strongest.\nThis effect is related to differences in the proximity of the hydrogen bridges in all of the studied compounds. In the ortho, bridges are located in close vicinity to each other and show mutual competition, which results in lowering their strength. In the meta, hydrogen bridges compete with each other; however, they have more spatial freedom and the binding energy lowering effect is weaker. In the para, HBs are the strongest due to their specific, alternate arrangement and planarity of the molecule. As such, HBs do not exhibit as strong of a competition."

Note that the stronger the HB, the more negative the CVB index. This is happening due to a shortening of the distance between the acceptor and hydrogen atom and the enhancing covalent character of the HB. Therefore, the bifurcation point value between valence basin formed by the donor atom and its bonding hydrogen atom and valence bath of the acceptor atom increases, resulting in decreasing the value of CVB index. The ELF plots can be found in Figure 9 and in Supplementary Material: Figures S5\u2013S7.\nThe CVB indexes for all of the investigated compounds, presented in Table 8 and in Supplementary Material: Table S2, are negative. This indicates the presence of hydrogen bonding between analysed atoms. As shown in the QTAIM BCPs analysis, the intramolecular HB in the para isomer is the strongest (CVB is the most negative) and in the ortho it is the weakest. Applying the PCM in DFT calculations does not affect molecular topology significantly; consequently, the results are almost analogous to those obtained in vacuo.\nConsidering the competition between intramolecular HBs in the ortho and meta isomers and geometrical analysis, it can be concluded that the symmetry breaking phenomenon in the crystal structure appears due to the attempt to arrange the system and maintain the strongest HBs, which stabilise single molecules and also have their share in stabilising the whole crystal structure by cooperation with H\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7O\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7H intermolecular interactions. Through rotating one of the side rings, the distance between two hydrogen\nbridges increases and the competition affects HBs less significantly. The rotation is strongest in the ortho isomer, where strongest competitive contacts between the bridges occur. Moreover, due to the appearance of the rotation phenomenon, it is possible to achieve stronger stabilisation of the crystal structure by creating stacking or (C)Ph\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7H interactions with some fragments of the molecules. The gas phase structures are not affected by additional intermolecular interactions; therefore, they exhibit the tendency of aromatic systems to maintain planarity as much as allowed by repulsion between the substituents. Due to this, the GP-optimised structures are less prone to symmetry breaking. The issue of symmetry of molecular adducts in the gas phase is currently considered a challenging topic because of diverse time scales involved from the experimental side, as well as intricate competition between non-covalent interactions responsible for shaping and stabilising the adducts [78]."

            "text": "The QTAIM, NCI or ELF approaches allow insight into the details of specific interactions. On the other hand, the Symmetry-Adapted Perturbation Theory (SAPT) decomposition scheme provides a more general picture, at the price of losing the ability to pinpoint specific interaction. SAPT divides the interaction energy into several groups of terms: electrostatic, exchange, induction and dispersion, which is possible by the use of proper imposition of the wavefunction permutational symmetry [68]. The electrostatic term describes Coulombic interaction between two parts constituting the dimer, but with the electron densities taken from \u201cisolated molecule\u201d scenario: the two parts interact, but their densities are kept frozen. The same holds for the exchange term, describing the Pauli repulsion. The induction term introduces relaxation of the electron densities of the monomers\u2014polarisation by the presence of the other partner, and associated changes in the Coulombic and Pauli energies. Finally, the correlation between fluctuations of electron densities between the monomers gives rise to dispersion forces. All these terms can be estimated to a given perturbational order, yielding particular levels of SAPT theory [68,72]. The most popular are SAPT0 (without inclusion of intra-monomer electron correlation effects) and SAPT2, while recent proposals include sSAPT0 (scaled SAPT0) deemed to be potentially very accurate at the fraction of the computational cost of SAPT2 [73]. These three levels, SAPT0, sSAPT0 and SAPT2, were evaluated for the dimers of the studied compounds taken from the crystal structures (see Table 1 and Figure 10), and the results are presented in Table 9.\nThe detailed division of interaction energy terms in Table 9 is presented for the highest SAPT2 level, so that the electrostatics, exchange, induction and dispersion values sum up to the SAPT2 energy. The interaction is rendered ca. 1\u20132 kcal mol\u22121 stronger at the SAPT0 level; we have already observed such overbinding for similar systems [33]. The scaled SAPT0 level performs in a very similar way to the SAPT0.\nThe dimers extracted from the ortho and para crystal structures share a common motif: they can be described as \u201cstacked\u201d (dimer 1) and \u201cheld by C-H\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7O bonds\u201d (dimer 2). Moreover, the planes formed by the corresponding rings of the constituent monomers are parallel in dimer 1 and almost perpendicular in dimer 2 (see Figure 10). This leads to large differences in the respective terms of the SAPT decomposition. In particular, the exchange contributions are very much different between the dimer 1 and dimer 2 series, which is the consequence of the mutual orientation of the monomers. The stacking arrangement relies on an overlap of large, relatively flat areas, which results in increased total Pauli repulsion. On the other hand, in dimer 2, the intermolecular contacts are scarce (see Figure 10 where they are denoted with orange dots) and the exchange repulsion is small in absolute value. Electrostatics, resulting from permanent charge distribution of the original monomers, is also larger for the dimer 1 series. This is easier to understand for the para- isomers, where dimer 2 is composed of two almost perpendicular molecules, yielding most unfavourable arrangement for dipoles, although good for quadrupole moments. However, the difference in the contact area between the dimer 1 and 2 series is best visible in the dispersion term. For the ortho compound, the dispersion term is three times smaller for dimer 2, whereas in the para series, the difference is ten-fold. Seemingly, dispersion is the most important binding component for the stacked dimers (dimer 1 series). The meta isomer behaves differently. Both dimers extracted from the crystal structure can be considered \u201cstacked\u201d, and dispersion is crucial for their stability; the difference between its magnitude for the meta dimers 1 and 2 is less than twofold. The same is true for the exchange term. Speculatively, the difference between the ortho, meta and para dimers might be attributed to the combination of their (non-)planarity and spatial\ncrowding. Although the planar para compound with the highest symmetry among the studied molecules is able to form strong stacking interactions, this is less rewarding for the ortho and meta isomers. Further, the meta isomer molecule is less crowded sterically, which is clearly visible upon comparison of the NCI gradient isosurfaces of the ortho and meta dimers\u2014see earlier sections and Figure 7. This enables the formation of two different stacked dimer types in the crystal structure of the ortho compound. The final remark of the SAPT study is curiously small role of the induction term\u2014its values, ranging from \u22120.80 to \u22124.45 kcal mol\u22121, cannot be considered as decisive factors for the stability of the dimers. This stability arises from electrostatics and dispersion, while the exchange component determines the intermolecular separation."

            "heading": "4. Conclusions",
            "text": "The three studied N,N\u2019-bis(salicylidene)-phenylenediamines are conformationally diversified. Only the para isomer is found to be very close to planarity in the crystal structure. Nevertheless, our study shows that the arrangement of the molecules in the respective crystals gives rise to numerous stacking, C-H\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7O and C-H\u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7C contacts. Spatially resolved non-covalent interaction analysis schemes (such as Hirshfeld surface, QTAIM, NCI, ELF) show that apparent steric crowding in the ortho isomer makes it possible to form a large quasi-macrocyclic ring in addition to the quasi-aromatic rings formed by the intramolecular hydrogen bonds. Interestingly, the more sterically crowded ortho and meta isomers exhibit major symmetry breaks in the solid state, while DFT calculations render both of these compounds as symmetrical. The para compound remains essentially symmetrical in all the studied cases. The aromatic rings retain however their aromaticity in the molecular structures. Despite having potentially easily modulated intramolecular hydrogen bonds, the studied molecules were not affected strongly by the implicit PCM solvation model, and also the polarisation term of the SAPT decomposition does not play any significant role in the formation of dimeric structures. Thus, the studied salen analogues are excellent examples of structural diversity in a seemingly closely related set of compounds. Summarising, our study has revealed:\n(i) The computational approaches have indicated the presence of diverse types of noncovalent interactions shaping the conformational landscape of the crystals; (ii) The employed QTAIM and NCI analyses have illustrated distribution of non-covalent interactions in the optimised structures; (iii) Application of QTAIM enabled the quantitative description of the electron density distribution in the hydrogen bonds; (iv) Application of the symmetry-adapted perturbation theory for the dimers derived from crystallographic data provided new information on the energy components in the studied dimers; the important role of dispersion was noted, especially in comparison with rather small induction terms.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/sym15020424/s1, Table of contents: I.
