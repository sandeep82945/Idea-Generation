1. **Investigate the long-term effects of lockdown social isolation on employees' mental health and well-being.** This study focused on the immediate effects of lockdown social isolation, but it would be valuable to examine how these effects persist or change over time. This could help to inform the development of long-term support and intervention strategies for employees who have experienced lockdown social isolation.


2. **Explore the role of individual differences in moderating the relationship between lockdown social isolation and lockdown stress.** This study found that mindfulness can moderate the relationship between lockdown social isolation and lockdown stress, but it is likely that other individual differences also play a role. For example, resilience, optimism, and social support may all be protective factors that can help to buffer the negative effects of lockdown social isolation.


3. **Examine the effectiveness of different interventions for reducing lockdown social isolation and its negative consequences.** Given the harmful effects of lockdown social isolation, it is important to develop and evaluate interventions that can help to reduce social isolation and its negative consequences. This could include interventions that promote social connection, such as online support groups or virtual social events, as well as interventions that teach coping skills for managing stress and anxiety.


4. **Investigate the relationship between lockdown social isolation and other outcomes, such as job performance, work engagement, and turnover.** This study focused on the relationship between lockdown social isolation and lockdown stress, but it is likely that lockdown social isolation also has other negative consequences for employees. For example, lockdown social isolation may lead to decreased job performance, lower work engagement, and higher turnover.


5. **Conduct a longitudinal study to examine the relationship between lockdown social isolation and mental health over time.** This study was cross-sectional, meaning that it only looked at the relationship between lockdown social isolation and mental health at one point in time. A longitudinal study would allow researchers to examine how this relationship changes over time, which could provide valuable insights into the long-term effects of lockdown social isolation.
