1. **Investigate the use of other NLP techniques for CLI risk prediction.** The paper explores five NLP techniques for mapping CLI commands to machine learning problems. However, there are many other NLP techniques that could be explored, such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and named entity recognition. These techniques could be used to improve the accuracy of CLI risk prediction.


2. **Develop a multi-class classifier for CLI risk prediction.** The paper focuses on developing a binary classifier for CLI risk prediction, which can only predict whether a command is risky or not. However, it would be useful to develop a multi-class classifier that can predict the specific type of risk associated with a command. This would allow DRIs to take more targeted action to mitigate the risk.


3. **Explore the use of deep learning for CLI risk prediction.** Deep learning is a powerful machine learning technique that has been shown to achieve state-of-the-art results on a variety of NLP tasks. It would be interesting to explore the use of deep learning for CLI risk prediction. This could lead to further improvements in accuracy and performance.


4. **Investigate the use of transfer learning for CLI risk prediction.** Transfer learning is a machine learning technique that allows a model to learn from one task and then apply that knowledge to a different task. This could be used to improve the accuracy of CLI risk prediction by transferring knowledge from a model that has been trained on a different NLP task.


5. **Develop a tool that can automatically redact sensitive information from CLI commands.** The paper proposes a method for using machine learning to predict sensitive information in CLI commands. However, it does not provide a tool that can automatically redact this information. It would be useful to develop a tool that can do this, which would make it easier for DRIs to maintain secure systems.
