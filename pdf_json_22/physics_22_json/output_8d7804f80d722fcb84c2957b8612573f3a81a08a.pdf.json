    "abstractText": "We report on the theoretical electronic spectra of twisted phosphorene bilayers exhibiting moir\u00e9 patterns, as computed by means of a continuous approximation to the moir\u00e9 superlattice Hamiltonian. Our model is constructed by interpolating between effective \u0393-point conductionand valenceband Hamiltonians for the different stacking configurations approximately realized across the moir\u00e9 supercell, formulated on symmetry grounds. We predict the realization of three distinct regimes for \u0393-point electrons and holes at different twist angle ranges: a Hubbard regime for small twist angles \u03b8 < 2\u25e6, where the electronic states form arrays of quantum-dot-like states, one per moir\u00e9 supercell; a Tomonaga-Luttinger regime at intermediate twist angles 2\u25e6 < \u03b8 . 10\u25e6, characterized by the appearance of arrays of quasi-1D states; and, finally, a ballistic regime at large twist angles \u03b8 & 10\u25e6, where the band-edge states are delocalized, with dispersion anisotropies modulated by the twist angle. Our method correctly reproduces recent results based on large-scale ab initio calculations at a much lower computational cost, and with fewer restrictions on the twist angles considered.",

We predict the realization of three distinct regimes for \u0393-point electrons and holes at different twist angle ranges: a Hubbard regime for small twist angles \u03b8 < 2\u25e6, where the electronic states form arrays of quantum-dot-like states, one per moire\u0301 supercell; a Tomonaga-Luttinger regime at intermediate twist angles 2\u25e6 < \u03b8 . 10\u25e6, characterized by the appearance of arrays of quasi-1D states; and, finally, a ballistic regime at large twist angles \u03b8 & 10\u25e6, where the band-edge states are delocalized, with dispersion anisotropies modulated by the twist angle. Our method correctly reproduces recent results based on large-scale ab initio calculations at a much lower computational cost, and with fewer restrictions on the twist angles considered.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nTwisted bilayers of two-dimensional materials have quickly arisen as playgrounds for the exploration of fundamental physics, and potential platforms for novel technological applications. Unconventional superconductivity [1], magnetic phenomena [2, 3] and Mott insulating phases [4] have been observed in twisted bilayer graphene at so-called magic angles, whereas Hubbard-model physics[5, 6], exciton miniband formation [7, 8] and confinement[9\u201312], and strong lattice reconstruction[13, 14] have been measured in semiconducting transition-metal dilcogenide (TMD) bilayers. Underlying these phenomena is the formation of moire\u0301 patterns: approximate superlattice structures formed by the spatial modulation of the interlayer registry across the sample plane. The long-range periodicity of the moire\u0301 pattern folds and couples the carrier bands, producing ultra flat minibands that promote strong correlations. Thus far, the study of moire\u0301 superlattices in twisted bilayers of van der Waals materials has focused strongly on graphene and TMDs. By contrast, moire\u0301 physics in twisted phosphorene bilayers remains largely unexplored[15\u201320].\nHere, we present a model capable of describing the electronic spectra of twisted phosphorene bilayers. Through the construction of an effective superlattice Hamiltonian that considers interlayer hybridization and intralayer energy modulation by the moire\u0301 potential, we compute miniband structures for electrons and holes around the \u0393 point. This superlattice model is based on the so-called continuous approximation, obtained by interpolating between effective Hamiltonians for aligned phosphorene bilayers with all the different stacking configurations approximately realized inside the moire\u0301 supercell[21, 22].\n\u2217 d.ruiz-tijerina@fisica.unam.mx\nWe present a thorough, symmetry-based derivation of these effective models, which we parametrize based on density functional theory calculations for multiple aligned bilayers. We then report on the moire\u0301 miniband spectra of twisted phosphorene bilayers at multiple twist angles. Our results are in excellent agreement with recent large-scale ab initio calculations[16, 18, 20], which are limited by computational cost to relatively small moire\u0301 supercells, as well as to exactly commensurate twist angles. We identify three different twist angle regimes where the main conduction and valence states take on distinct geometries. At small angles (\u03b8 < 2\u25e6), we find that electrons (holes) localize at HH (HA) stacking sites [see Fig. 1(a)] to form mesoscale rectangular lattices, for which Hubbard model physics is anticipated. Then, at intermediate twist angles (2 < \u03b8 . 10\u25e6), electrons and holes delocalize along the long axis of the unit cell to form arrays of quasi-1D states. Finally, these states become fully delocalized in two dimensions at large twist angles (\u03b8 & 10\u25e6), exhibiting anisotropic dispersions efficiently modulated by the interlayer twist angle. Experimental confirmation of these qualitatively distinct limits, which we call the Hubbard, Tomonaga-Luttinger and ballistic regimes, respectively, would place phosphorene bilayers among the most versatile twistronic materials to date."

In a large-periodicity moire\u0301 superlattice, where the stacking configuration varies slowly across the mSC, the low energy electronic states are well described by the so-called continuum approximation. This approach has found remarkable success in describing electrons in twisted bilayer graphene[23\u201326] and twisted homo- and heterostructures of transition-metal dichalcogenides[21, 22, 27\u201333]. The approximation consists of treating r0 as a vector field r0(r) defined over the continuum of points r in the sample plane. For a two-dimensional homobilayer with twist angle \u03b8 1, r0(r) is well approximated by\nr0(r) = \u03b8z\u0302\u00d7 r. (5)\nAll superlattice parameters depending on r0, such as the interlayer distance d(r0), can then be interpolated for all values of r by the substitution (5), from known values at a finite number of stacking configurations.\nHere, we use this approach to interpolate an effective electronic Hamiltonian for the conduction and valence bands of twisted bilayer phosphorene. To achieve this, in Sec. III we compute the band structures of multiple aligned (\u03b8 = 0\u25e6) phosphorene bilayers at different stacking configurations using DFT. Then, in Sec. IV we develop effective r0-dependent Hamiltonians for the band-edge electrons of aligned phosphorene bilayers, using a symmetry-based approach. These models are then parametrized to match the DFT results in Sec. IV D. In Sec. V, we use Eq. (5) to interpolate the parametrized Hamiltonians across the mSC, obtaining a continuous approximation to the superlattice Hamiltonian, which we solve numerically using zone-folding methods to compute the moire\u0301 mini-band structures of twisted phosphorene bilayers at multiple twist angles.\nIII. AB INITIO RESULTS FOR ARBITRARILY STACKED PHOSPHORENE BILAYERS\nWe performed DFT computations as implemented in the Vienna Ab Initio Simulation Package[35\u201337] using the standard generalized gradient approximation, with the Perdew-Burke-Enzerhof (PBE) parametrization[38]. The electronic states are treated with projector-augmented wave basis sets[39]. The optimized cutoff energy for the plane wave expansion was 500 eV. Since we are treating the interaction between two phosphorene layers, a dispersion-corrected van der Waals scheme is necessary. Here, we used the GrimmeD3 method, in which the dispersion coefficients are adjusted to the local geometry of the system[40]. Force and energy convergence criteria were set to 0.01 eV/A\u030a and 1 \u00d7 10\u22126 eV, respectively.

Interlayer distances d (left) and scissor-corrected band-gap energies (right) of aligned phosphorene bilayers at the four high-symmetry stacking configurations AA, HH, BA and HA, as well as intermediate configurations. All values correspond to fully relaxed structures, as computed using PBE + Grimme-D3 DFT calculations. The obtained band gap was scissor-corrected based on the bilayer band gap for HA bilayers reported in Ref. 34.\nof 9 \u00d7 12 \u00d7 1 is used to sample the Brillouin zone (BZ) for structural optimization. For band structure calculations, a denser k-point mesh of 18\u00d724\u00d71 was used. The same mesh was also used to achieve self consistency for the fixed interlayer distance calculations.\nThe monolayer phosphorene used to build the bilayer systems was fully optimized to obtain the lattice parameters reported in Sec. II, which are in good agreement with previous reports[41, 42]. A vacuum gap of \u223c 20 A\u030a was used in the perpendicular direction to eliminate undesirable self-interactions between the phosphorene layers with their corresponding images generated by the artificial supercell periodicity. We performed computations for the four high-symmetry stacking configurations of Table I. In addition, we considered three intermediate configurations at 13 , 1 2 , and 2 3 of the path between each two subsequent high-symmetry stackings, following the path AA \u2192 HH \u2192 BA \u2192 HA. In total, we studied 13 differently stacked bilayer systems.\nEach phosphorene monolayer \u03bb is formed by two staggered P monolayers, P\u03bb1 and P \u03bb 2 , separated by an interlayer distance d between layers P b2 and P t 1 , along the axis perpendicular to the sample plane [see Fig. 1(a)]. All models were fully optimized to obtain the interlayer distance d as a function of the stacking vector r0. Figure 2 summarizes the main results. The shortest interlayer distance (3.21 A\u030a) is obtained for the HA bilayer, which constitutes the 2D building block of bulk black phosphorus[34]. HA is also the most stable configuration overall, with a lower cohesive energy than AA, BA and HH stackings by 0.075eV, 0.133eV, and 0.069eV, respectively. By contrast, BA bilayers are the least stable, and exhibit the largest interlayer distance overall (3.80 A), due to the large repulsion between P layers P b2 and P t 1 . These results are in good agreement with previous ab\ninitio results on phosphorene bilayers[43].\nIt is well known[44] that, whereas DFT calculations correctly describe the band structure topology, they do not correctly reproduce the experimental band gap. To address this issue, we implement a scissor correction, following earlier studies on semiconductors[45\u2013 51], using previously reported values for HA phosphorene bilayers[34] that correctly reproduce experimental measurements,[52], while retaining the band gap variation as described by our DFT calculations. The scissor correction consists of a rigid translation of all conduction bands by a gap correction energy \u03b4Esc = 1.31 eV.\nFigure 2 shows the scissor-corrected band gap variation as a function of stacking for all 13 configurations considered. All cases exhibit semiconducting behavior, with a gap energy modulation driven by the variation of the interlayer \u03c0 \u2212 \u03c0 interaction strength at different interlayer distances d(r0)[43]. Note that the gap energy follows the inverse trend of the interlayer distance between configurations AA and HH, when the unit cells are translated along the y\u0302 direction, reaching the overall minimum gap value of 1.34 eV for HH bilayers. The band gap then grows linearly by about 200 meV along the path between configurations HH and BA, following the same trend as the interlayer distance. Finally, the band varies nonmonotonically between BA and HA, reaching an overall maximum value of 2.04 eV at the midpoint between these two configurations. Previous reports on AA, BA, HH and HA phosphorene bilayers\u2014 including the optB88-vdW functional\u2014agree with our interlayer distances and band gap trend[43]. Our results are also consistent with data found using PBE without van der Waals interactions[53]. Calculations using the Heyd\u2013Scuseria\u2013Ernzerhof functional suggest that the band gaps for these stackings are approximately 0.65eV larger than the ones obtained by our PBE + Grimme-D3 calculations, before scissor corrections. Nonetheless, the same trend is obtained for the gap variation with stacking, showing the validity of our approximation.\nFigure 3 presents detailed band structures for the four relaxed high-symmetry bilayer configurations, setting the vacuum level as a common energy reference for all cases shown. Although the four high-symmetry configurations exhibit a direct band gap at the \u0393 point, analogous to the monolayer case, our DFT calculations show that four out of the nine intermediate stacking configurations deviate from this behavior, showing a valence-band maximum slightly away from \u0393 along the \u0393X direction, appearing approximately 115 meV above the \u0393-point valence band edge and making the gap slightly indirect. Further details can be found in Appendix A. It is unclear whether these features might change in a more sophisticated ab initio scheme (e.g., GW ). In the following, we shall focus on the band gap at the \u0393 point when describing the different stacking regions inside a mSC formed by a twisted phosphorene bilayer. This approximation is justified if one considers that, in an actual twisted bilayer, the different stacking regions will grow or shrink according to their\ncorresponding adhesion energies, as has been consistently observed in other 2D materials, such as graphene[54, 55] and transition-metal dichalcogenides[13, 14]. In the case at hand, BA stacking regions will shrink in favor of AA, HH and especially HA regions. The latter shall grow to form domains that occupy most of the mSC area. In turn, we expect all intermediate stacking regions to become domain walls, occupying only a small area of the mSC, and becoming less important for the description of the superlattice electronic states."

(13)\nWriting a general eigenstate of the system in the form |\u03a8\u3009 = \u2211 \u03b1,k ( A\u03a8\u03b1,k|\u03b1,k\u3009b +B\u03a8\u03b1,k|\u03b1,k\u3009t ) , (14)\nwe obtain the generalized eigenvalue problem\nH0\u03a8 = (1 + S)E\u03a8, (15)\nwith the column vector of coefficients \u03a8 defined as\n\u03a8 = ( {A\u03a8\u03b1,k} {B\u03a8\u03b1,k} ) , (16)\nand H0 containing all matrix elements of HM, except for those involving the overlap matrix S. Following Ferreira et al. [21] and Magorrian et al. [22], we transform Eq. (15) into a proper Schro\u0308dinger equation by applying the unitary transformation U = (1+S)\u22121/2, resulting in the effective Hamiltonian\nHeff \u2261 U\u22121H0U = H0 \u2212 {S, H0}\n2 +O{S2}, (17)\nwhere {S, H0} is the anti-commutator of matrices S and H0. Since the states |\u03b1,k\u3009\u03bb decay exponentially in the out-of-plane direction, away from z\u03bb, the matrix elements of S are exponentially suppressed by the interlayer distance. This justifies treating S as a perturbation, and truncating the expansion (17) at first order in S. Note, however, that H0 contains interlayer matrix elements [see Eq. (11)], which are also of order S. Up to first order in S, the intra- and interlayer matrix elements of Heff are\n\u03bb\u3008\u03b1\u2032,k\u2032|Heff |\u03b1,k\u3009\u03bb =\u03bb\u3008\u03b1\u2032,k\u2032|V\u03bb\u0304|\u03b1,k\u3009\u03bb,\nt\u3008\u03b1\u2032,k\u2032|Heff |\u03b1,k\u3009b = \u03b5\u03b1\u2032(k\n\u2032) + \u03b5\u03b1(k)\n2 S\u03b1 \u2032,\u03b1 k\u2032,k\n\u2212K\u03b1 \u2032,\u03b1\nk\u2032,k .\n(18)\nOne of the useful features of the above formulation for the homobilayer Hamiltonian is that all symmetry constraints are encoded in the wave functions and crystal potentials. The former may be Fourier expanded as \u03c8\u03bb\u03b1,k(r, z) \u2261 \u3008r, z|\u03b1,k\u3009\u03bb = \u2211 G ei(G+k)\u00b7(r\u2212r\u03bb)\u221a N u\u03bb\u03b1(G+k, z), (19) where G are the bilayer Bragg vectors, N the number of unit cells in the sample, and the Fourier coefficients u\u03bb\u03b1 are decaying functions of |z \u2212 z\u03bb|. Then, the interlayer overlap- and kinetic energy matrix elements can be written as\nS\u03b1 \u2032,\u03b1 k\u2032,k = \u2211 G,G\u2032 \u03b4G\u2032+k\u2032,G+ke i(G\u2032\u00b7rt\u2212G\u00b7rb)\n\u00d7 \u222b dz ut \u2217\u03b1\u2032 (G \u2032 + k\u2032, z)ub\u03b1(G + k, z),\n(20a)\nK\u03b1 \u2032,\u03b1 k\u2032,k = \u2212 \u2211 G,G\u2032 ~2 2m0 \u03b4G\u2032+k\u2032,G+ke i(G\u2032\u00b7rt\u2212G\u00b7rb)\n\u00d7 ( |G + k|2 \u222b d2r ut\u2217\u03b1\u2032(G \u2032 + k\u2032, z)ub\u03b1(G + k, z)\n+ \u222b dz [ \u2202zu t\u2217 \u03b1\u2032(G \u2032 + k\u2032, z) ] [ \u2202zu b \u03b1(G + k, z) ]) .\n(20b)\n6\nAt this point, we introduce two approximations: first, we approximate the Fourier series (19) by its dominant terms, corresponding to the first three stars of Bragg vectors:\nG0 = 0, G\u00b11 = \u00b1 2\u03c0ax , G\u00b12 = \u00b1 2\u03c0 ay , G\u00b13 = \u00b1 (G1 \u2212G2) , G\u00b14 = \u00b1 (G1 + G2) , G\u00b15 = \u00b12G1, G\u00b16 = \u00b12G2.\n(21)\nSecond, we assume that the functions u\u03b1(G + k, z) vary slowly with wave vector, such that for k close enough to the \u0393 point we may approximate u\u03b1(G+k, z) \u2248 u\u03b1(G, z). Finally, since we are concerned exclusively with wave vectors k and k\u2032 much smaller than any reciprocal lattice vector, we may write\n\u03b4k\u2212k\u2032,Gn\u2032\u2212Gn = \u03b4k,k\u2032\u03b4n,n\u2032 .

Accordingly, all \u0393-point states transform under symmetry operations like one of the group\u2019s irreducible representations (irreps). The transformation rules are especially simple for group D2h, which contains only onedimensional irreps, and take the form\nD\u03c8\u03bb\u03b1,0(r, z) = \u03c6(I\u03b1,D)\u03c8\u03bb\u03b1,0(r, z), (25)\nwhere D \u2208 D2h; I\u03b1 is the irreducible representation of group D2h corresponding to band \u03b1; and \u03c6(I\u03b1,D) is the character of I\u03b1 under the symmetry operation D (see Table II).

(34c)\nThis completes the derivation of all terms defining the Hamiltonian (6). Although Eqs. (30a), (30b), (32a), (32b) and (33) can ultimately be expressed in terms of microscopic quantities, our strategy will consist of fitting all parameters {t(n)\u03b1 }, {v(n)\u03b1 }, {w(n)\u03b1 } to first principles results, as described in Sec. IV D below.\nD. Ab initio parametrization of the effective model\nThe tunneling coefficients t (n) \u03b1 and potential energies\n\u03b5 (n) \u03b1 and \u03c6 (2) \u03b1 appearing in Eqs. (30) and (34), respec-\n8 tively, were fitted to reproduce the conduction- and valence subband (see Fig. 3) energies obtained from scissorcorrected DFT calculations for multiple stacking configurations r0, at fixed interlayer distance d. Figure 4 shows a comparison between the DFT-computed energies, and the energies obtained from the effective models (6) with parameters fitted to the DFT data, for fixed interlayer distance d = 3.8 A\u030a. The fitting procedure was repeated for d = 3.7 and 3.6 A\u030a. In all cases, we found that good agreement with the DFT energies can be obtained setting \u03c6 (2) \u03b1 = \u03b5 (1) \u03b1 = t (5) c = \u03b5 (3) v = 0. Note that \u03c6 (2) \u03b1 = 0 suggests the absence of an out-of-plane ferroelectric effect, such as that observed in transition-metal dichalcogenide homo- and heterobilayers[58], in agreement with recent ab initio results[59].\nThe d dependence of each remaining model parameter was then fitted as A(d) = A0e\n\u2212q(d\u2212d0), taking d0 = 3.49 A\u030a as a reference interlayer distance (see Sec. V below). In the limit of d d0, corresponding to two decoupled bilayers, all model parameters should vanish, with the exception of \u03b5 (0) \u03b1 , which should converge to the monolayer \u03b1-band edge energies, \u03b5ML\u03b1 . Therefore, in the following we rewrite:\n\u03b5(0)\u03b1 = \u03b5 ML \u03b1 + \u03b4\u03b5 0 \u03b1(d), (35)\nwith the scissor-corrected DFT values \u03b5MLv = \u22125.012 eV and \u03b5MLc = \u03b5 ML v + \u03b4Esc = \u22123.702 eV.

Note, however, that the resulting model contains the interlayer distance d as a fixed parameter. To take into account out-ofplane lattice relaxation, i.e., the fact that the interlayer\ndistance will vary across the mSC according to the local stacking, we interpolate the DFT values for the interlayer distance reported in Fig. 2 by the Fourier series\nd(r0) = d0 + N\u2211 n=1 [dsn cos (Gn \u00b7 r0) + dan sin (Gn \u00b7 r0)] ,\n(36) where the constant d0 was chosen as a reference interlayer distance when fitting the model parameters reported in Table III.

A detailed discussion of this can be found in Appendix E.\nThe interpolated band Hamiltonians H\u03b1(r) now explicitly contain the superlattice periodicity through the moire\u0301 Bragg vectors gn, and can be numerically diagonalized in a zone-folding scheme: Let k be a vector of the mBZ shown in Fig. 1, and consider how H\u03b1(r) acts\n9\non the monolayer plane-wave states (gmn \u2261 mg1 + ng2) \u3008r|\u03c6kmn\u3009b = 1\u221a S ( ei(k+gmn)\u00b7r 0 ) , \u3008r|\u03c6kmn\u3009t = 1\u221a S ( 0 ei(k+gmn)\u00b7r ) , (40) where S are the monolayer surface areas, assumed equal.

Note that we have generalized the Bloch function energy \u03b5 (0) \u03b1 = \u03b5ML\u03b1 +\u03b4\u03b5 (0) \u03b1 to wave vectors close to the \u0393 point as \u03b5 (0) \u03b1 \u2192 \u03b5t/b,(0)\u03b1 (k + gmn), by introducing the kinetic energy terms\n\u03b5t/b,(0)\u03b1 (q) \u2261 \u03b5ML\u03b1 + \u03b4\u03b5(0)\u03b1 + ~2|(R\u2213\u03b8/2q) \u00b7 x\u0302|2\n2m (0) \u03b1,x\n+ ~2|(R\u2213\u03b8/2q) \u00b7 y\u0302|2\n2m (0) \u03b1,y\n.\n(43)\nHere, m (0) c,x = 1.12m0, m (0) c,y = 0.46m0, m (0) v,x = 1.61m0 and m (0) v,y = 0.23m0 are the monolayer-band effective masses[60], and the relative interlayer twist angle is included through the passive rotation of the monolayer dispersions.\nThe zone-folding scheme consists in mapping all states (40) lying outside the mBZ into minibands inside the mBZ as\n\u03b5t/bmn(k) \u2261 \u03b5t/b,(0)\u03b1 (k + gmn), k \u2208 mBZ, (44)\nlabeled by the moire\u0301 vector indices (m,n). The minibands couple vertically\u2014i.e., conserving the mBZ wave vector k\u2014amongst themselves according to the matrix elements (41) and (42), thus defining an eigenvalue problem that can be solved numerically for a finite number of minibands. In practice, we have found that the lowest conduction minibands are well converged for a range of indices \u221210 \u2264 m,n \u2264 10, corresponding to 882 basis states, for twist angles as small as \u03b8 = 1\u25e6; whereas for the valence bands a total of 1250 basis states (\u221212 \u2264 m,n \u2264 12) were needed. The resulting lowest (highest) energy eigenvalues represent the electronic energy spectra for the conduction (valence) bands around the \u03b3 point of the mBZ."

            "text": "Figure 6(a) shows the first few conduction- and valence minibands for twist angles \u03b8 = 1\u25e6 and 4\u25e6. Flat minibands, corresponding to carrier states with vanishing group velocities, form for \u03b8 = 1\u25e6. To visualize the spatial distribution of the flat-miniband states, Fig. 7 shows their moduli squared averaged across the mBZ. The flat\nminibands correspond to arrays of spin-degenerate localized states, one per mSC, with the periodicity of the moire\u0301 superlattice. Conduction electrons localize near areas with HH stacking, whereas valence holes localize at HA regions of the mSC. In both cases, the localized states stretch along the y\u0302 axis, following the anisotropies of the corresponding moire\u0301 potentials, shown in Fig. 11 of Appendix E. Thus, the localized wavefunctions approximately inherit the symmetry of the monolayer crystals, a feature that can be identified experimentally by scanning tunneling microscopy. This is most clearly observed in the lowest-energy conduction and highest-energy valence wavefunctions, which are s-like states stretched along the phosphorene unit cell\u2019s long axis (see Fig. 1). The secondlowest conduction miniband resembles a slightly rotated py orbital, whereas the third and fourth ones clearly reflect the irregularities of the electron-confining potential, in particular its lack of an x\u0302 \u2192 \u2212x\u0302 mirror symmetry. In the valence case, the second-highest miniband is also formed by s-like orbitals elongated in the y\u0302 axis, but localized at mSC HH regions, where a local minimum appears in the moire\u0301 potential (Fig. 11). This alternation between localization at HA and HH areas continues for the next two valence minibands, which resemble p orbitals deformed by the confining potential anisotropy.\nWhen electron-electron interactions are taken into account, the localized conduction- and valence states described above for \u03b8 = 1\u25e6 suggest the realization of SU(2) Hubbard model physics for both \u0393-point electrons and holes, putting twisted phosphorene bilayers in the list of twistronic Hubbard materials, together with transitionmetal dichalcogenide bilayer structures[5, 6]. We shall henceforth refer to this as the Hubbard regime.\nAn altogether different regime is found for \u03b8 = 4\u25e6, where the lowest conduction- and highest valence minibands remain flat along the x\u0302 direction (along the segments x s and y \u03b3), but become dispersive in the y\u0302 direction\u2014a consequence of the large mass anisotropies of the monolayer bands. Figure 8 shows that these minibands correspond to arrays of quasi-one-dimensional states that propagate along the y\u0302 axis. For conduction electrons, these 1D states cross the HH and BA regions of the mSC, whereas valence holes exhibit a richer behavior. We find a nearly degenerate doublet of 1D states crossing the mSC at different regions: for the highest minibands, the 1D states propagate along the HH\u2212 BA segment, whereas the next highest miniband corresponds to a 1D state along the AA\u2212HA line. In both cases, delocalization follows the shrinking of the mSC with increasing twist angle, which introduces a spatial overlap between neighboring localized states along the y\u0302 direction. We predict that these states should behave as coupled Tomonaga-Luttinger liquids[61, 62] in the presence of electron-electron interactions, and we will refer to this as the Tomonaga-Luttinger regime.\nTo establish the crossover between the Hubbard- an Tomonaga-Luttinger regimes, Fig. 9 shows two quantitative indicators of localization for the bottom conduction-\n11\n12\nand top valence minibands. In the top panel, we report their bandwidths for twist angles between 1\u25e6 and 5\u25e6, where a vanishing bandwidth is characteristic of the fully localized states of the Hubbard regime, whereas the Tomonaga-Luttinger regime exhibits a finite bandwidth. Based on typical experimental resolutions, we propose a 10 meV bandwidth as a reasonable value to define the crossover between the two regimes, which occurs around \u03b8 = 2.85\u25e6 for the conduction band, and around \u03b8 = 2.6\u25e6 for the valence band. A consistent result is obtained by considering the probability density ratio\nRloc = |\u03c8(rinter)|2/|\u03c8(rmax)|2, (45)\nwhere |\u03c8|2 is the mBZ-averaged miniband wave-function squared reported in Figs. 7 and 8. The ratio (45) compares the state\u2019s weights at two different positions in an arbitrary mSC: rmax, which is the localization site in the Hubbard regime (near HH for the conduction miniband, and HA for the valence miniband), and rinter = rmax + a M 1 /2, corresponding to the position half way between that site and its replica in the next mSC along the positive y\u0302 axis. This ratio Rloc vanishes in the Hubbard limit, and tends to 1 deep in the Tomonaga-Luttinger limit. Setting the threshold between the two regimes at Rloc = 0.1, the bottom panel of Fig. 9 also establishes the crossover twist angles \u03b8 = 2.4\u25e6 and \u03b8 = 3\u25e6 for the conduction- and valence minibands, respectively.\nFinally, our model predicts fully dispersive, anisotropic conduction- and valence minibands at twist angles \u03b8 & 10\u25e6, which we call the ballistic regime. However, as discussed in Sec. II, our continuous model represents a good\napproximation to the superlattice Hamiltonian only for small enough twist angles, for which the moire\u0301 periodicity is much larger than the atomic spacings. From Eq. (4) we can estimate that this condition roughly corresponds to \u03b8 < 8\u25e6, indicating that the crossover between the Tomonaga-Luttinger and ballistic regimes is not accurately described by our continuous model, including the specific crossover angles. Having forewarned the reader, we shall now assume that the continuous model can at least describe the ballistic regime at the qualitative level, and report our results. To quantify the anisotropies of the first conduction- and valence minibands, in Fig. 6(b) we plot their mass ratio my\u03b1/m x \u03b1 for a wide range of twist angles. For the valence band, the mass ratio varies across three decades between \u03b8 = 10\u25e6 and \u03b8 = 25\u25e6, indicating that the twist angle is an efficient knob for tuning the mass anisotropy of holes. A more modest but still quite significant variation of a factor of 10 is found for the mass ratio in the case of the lowest conduction miniband.\nThe continuous superlattice model predictions summa-\n13\nrized in this section are in excellent agreement with recent results based on large-scale DFT calculations, reported in Refs. 16 and 18, with one exception: For the Tomonaga-Luttinger regime, both references identify the highest valence miniband with the 1D states propagating along the AA\u2212HA segment of the mSC, which we identify as the second highest valence miniband. We attribute this quantitative discrepancy to the similar depths of the competing potential wells for holes appearing at HA and HH regions of the superlattice, as shown in Fig. 11 of Appendix E. The energy order of the resulting states will necessarily depend on the fine quantitative details, which can differ in distinct DFT approximations.\nWe remark that our numerical calculations, which rely on the model parametrization presented in Table III and the zone-folding approach described in Sec. V, were carried out at a low computational cost, and are easily reproducible. Moreover, the moire\u0301 gauge potential picture that derives from the continuum approximation to the superlattice Hamiltonian, discussed in detail in Appendix E, provides an intuitive picture for the origin of the low-dimensional states that emerge in the Hubbard and Tomonaga-Luttinger regimes. Admittedly, the validity of our continuous model in the large twist angle- or ballistic regime is questionable due to the reduced superlattice periodicity. However, the qualitative agreement between our results and the ab initio calculations of Ref. [18] lends some credibility to our extrapolation to large twist angles."

            "text": "In this paper, we have proposed a moire\u0301 superlattice Hamiltonian capable of describing the low-energy electronic spectra of twisted phosphorene bilayers. Numerical diagonalization of our model within a zone folding scheme has revealed three qualitatively distinct types of electronic states, depending on the twist angle: At small twist angles \u03b8 < 2\u25e6, electrons and holes localize near regions of the mSC with approximate local HH- and HA stackings, respectively, giving mesoscale realizations of the SU(2) Hubbard model on a rectangular lattice, and motivating the term Hubbard regime. At intermediate angles 2\u25e6 < \u03b8 . 10\u25e6, we predict the formation of arrays of quasi-1D states that propagate across the mSC, along the long axis of the phosphorene unit cell. Each of these states can potentially exhibit Luttinger liquid properties, which motivates the term Tomonaga-Luttinger regime. Finally, fully dispersive minibands are recovered at large\ntwist angles \u03b8 & 10\u25e6, which we call the ballistic regime. In this case, we propose the twist angle as an efficient knob for tuning the miniband anisotropies, modulating their mass ratios by up to a factor of 101 in the conduction case, and of 103 in the valence case. We believe that observation of these regimes is well within current experimental capabilities, by a combination of scanning tunneling microscopy and transport experiments. All of our results are in good agreement with large-scale ab initio calculations found in the recent literature[16, 18, 20]. The effective models developed in this paper are easily reproducible at a low computational cost, and motivate an intuitive understanding of the emergence of lowdimensional states based on the local properties of the different mSC regions.\nTo construct our superlattice Hamiltonian, we have formulated symmetry-based effective models for the lowest conduction- and highest valence \u0393-point subband states of aligned phosphorene bilayers with arbitrary stacking. These models have been parametrized based on PBE + Grimme-D3 DFT calculations, supplemented with scissor corrections for the band gap, and fully taking into account out-of-plane relaxation of the bilayer system. We propose that these models may be used in their own right to describe the band structures of HA, HH and AA bilayer phosphorene domains. Analogous to the cases of twisted bilayer graphene[54, 55] and twisted transitionmetal dichalcogenide homo- and heterobilayers[13, 14], strong in-plane relaxation may also occur in twisted phosphorene bilayers at small enough twist angles, resulting in the formation of large HA domains, surrounded by smaller HH and AA ones, which can be individually described by the effective models discussed in this paper."

These band structures, like those reported in Fig. 3, were obtained from PBE + Grimme-D3 DFT calculations, with a scissor-corrected band gap based on Ref. [34]. By contrast to the high-symmetry stacking cases, we find five intermediate configurations where the band gap becomes slightly indirect, due to the appearance of a global valence band maximum close to the \u0393 point, along the \u0393 X line of the BZ. In three out of these five cases this maximum is significantly higher in energy than the \u0393-point valence state, reaching a maximum energy difference of \u2248 115 meV."

(D1), because all cases involve tunneling between a band that transforms like representation B1u of group D2h (band c), and another that transforms like representation B3g (bands v and c\u2032).\nThe total Hamiltonian, involving two layers with three\nbands each, takes the form\nH6\u00d76eff =  \u03b50c Tc 0 Tc,v 0 Tc,c\u2032 T \u2217c \u03b5 0 c \u2212T \u2217c,v 0 \u2212T \u2217c,c\u2032 0 0 \u2212Tc,v \u03b50v Tv 0 0 T \u2217c,v 0 T \u2217 v \u03b5 0 v 0 0\n0 \u2212Tc,c\u2032 0 0 \u03b50c\u2032 Tc\u2032 T \u2217c,c\u2032 0 0 0 T \u2217 c\u2032 \u03b5 0 c\u2032  , (D4)\nwith the basis ordering {|c\u3009b, |c\u3009t, |v\u3009b, |v\u3009t, |c\u2032\u3009b, |c\u2032\u3009t}. In Eq. (D4), we have introduced the energy of the monolayer \u0393-point state of band c\u2032, \u03b50c\u2032 , and the tunneling matrix element T \u2217c\u2032 , which has the same form as Eq. (30a).\nNext, we project out the block {|c\u2032\u3009b, |c\u2032\u3009t} up to second order in perturbation theory using Lo\u0308wdin\u2019s partitioning[57], resulting in\nH4\u00d74eff =  \u03b50c \u2212 |Tc,c\u2032 | 2 \u03b50 c\u2032\u2212\u03b5 0 c\nTc 0 Tc,v\nT \u2217c \u03b5 0 c \u2212\n|Tc,c\u2032 | 2 \u03b50 c\u2032\u2212\u03b5 0 c\u2032 \u2212T \u2217c,v 0\n0 \u2212Tc,v \u03b50v Tv T \u2217c,v 0 T \u2217 v \u03b5 0 v  , (D5)\nand an independent 2 \u00d7 2 Hamiltonian for the c\u2032 band sector, which is not of interest to us at the moment. Repeating the projection procedure, this time to eliminate the interlayer coupling between conduction and valence bands at second order in perturbation theory, we obtain\nHceff \u2248 \u03b50c \u2212 |Tc,c\u2032 |2\u03b50c\u2032\u2212\u03b50c + |Tc,v|2\u03b50c\u2212\u03b50v Tc T \u2217c \u03b5 0 c \u2212 |Tc,c\u2032 | 2\n\u03b50 c\u2032\u2212\u03b5 0 c\u2032 + |Tc,v|2 \u03b50c\u2212\u03b50v  (D6a)\nHveff \u2248 \u03b50v \u2212 |Tc,v|2\u03b50c\u2212\u03b50v Tv T \u2217v \u03b5 0 v \u2212 |Tv,c|2 \u03b50c\u2212\u03b50v  , (D6b) where we have approximated\n\u03b50v \u2212 \u03b50c + |Tc,c\u2032 |2\n\u03b50c\u2032 \u2212 \u03b50c \u2248 \u03b50v \u2212 \u03b50c .

Comparing (D9) with Eqs. (6) and (8) yields Eq. (33)."

(6), constitute effective gauge potentials[21, 65] for the phosphorene electronic states. In the limit of an infinite superlattice periodicity, the motion of an \u03b1-band electron can be described by H\u03b1(v), where the position r is replaced by a parameter v that varies adiabatically as different regions of the twisted homobilayer are explored. From this point of view, we may compute the energy eigenvalues of H\u03b1(v) as functions of the adiabatic parameter v in the form\nE\u00b1\u03b1 (v) = \u03b5 (0) \u03b1 + \u03b4\u03b5\u03b1(v)\u00b1 |T\u03b1(v)| . (E1)\nBy reinstating v\u2192 r, the eigenvalues E\u2212c (v) and E+v (v) can be interpreted as effective moire\u0301 potentials acting on the conduction and valence electrons, respectively. These potentials are plotted in Fig. 11 for a \u03b8 = 2\u25e6 twisted phosphorene bilayer.\nThe potential E\u2212c (r) features wells capable of confining conduction electrons, shown in dark blue in the top panel of Fig. 11. These potential wells produce either the localized, quantum-dot-like states shown in Fig. 7, or the quasi-1D states shown in Fig. 8, depending on the size of the mSC, as determined by the twist angle. Similarly, E+v (r) shows potential barriers, depicted in the bottom panel of Fig. 11 as dark red spots, which can localize holes. Note that in the valence, in addition to the absolute minima that appear at HA regions of the mSC, there are secondary, local minima at AA stacking regions. The appearance of these two competing sets of minima made it necessary to expand the exponential functions describing the d(r) dependence of the valence-band parameters up to second order, to correctly capture the relative depths of these potential wells. Note that for both the conduction and valence cases, the potential wells are both anisotropic and irregular, explaining the asymmetric shapes of the charge densities reported in Fig. 7."
