Metal dysregulation, including excessive zinc released by presynaptic neurons, plays an important role in tau pathology and oxidase activation. The activities of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)/ribosomal S6 protein kinase (p70S6K) are elevated in the brains of patients with Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Zinc induces tau hyperphosphorylation via mTOR/P70S6K activation in vitro. However, the involvement of the mTOR/P70S6K pathway in zinc-induced oxidative stress, tau degeneration, and synaptic and cognitive impairment has not been fully elucidated in vivo. Here, we assessed the effect of pathological zinc concentrations in SH-SY5Y cells by using biochemical assays and immunofluorescence staining. Rats (n = 18, male) were laterally ventricularly injected with zinc, treated with rapamycin (intraperitoneal injection) for 1 week, and assessed using the Morris water maze. Evaluation of oxidative stress, tau phosphorylation, and synaptic impairment was performed using the hippocampal tissue of the rats by biochemical assays and immunofluorescence staining. The results from the Morris water maze showed that the capacity of spatial memory was impaired in zinctreated rats. Zinc sulfate significantly increased the levels of P-mTOR Ser2448, P-p70S6K Thr389, and P-tau Ser356 and decreased the levels of nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) and heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in SH-SY5Y cells and in zinc-treated rats compared with the control groups.

            "text": "Alzheimer\u2019s disease (AD) is pathologically characterized by abnormal accumulation of amyloid-beta (Ab) plaques, neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs), neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, synaptic impairment, and neurodegeneration (1). Pathological changes lead to cognitive decline and impairment in patients and in animal models. The microtubule-associated protein tau is abnormally hyperphosphorylated and mainly aggregates into paired helical filaments (PHFs) in the brains of patients with AD (2, 3). Tau hyperphosphorylation is mediated by protein kinases or phosphatases, which are involved in AD neurofibrillary degeneration (4, 5). The mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and ribosomal S6 protein kinase (p70S6K) are serine/threonine kinases that play key roles in the regulation of protein synthesis and degradation, age-dependent cognitive decline, and pathogenesis of AD (6\u20138). Accumulating evidence has demonstrated that abnormal mTOR signaling in the brain affects several pathways inAD that are associatedwithmetabolism, insulin signaling, protein aggregation, mitochondrial function, and oxidative stress (9). Increased expression of mTOR and P70S6K colocalizes with NFT andmediates tau phosphorylation (6, 7, 10 8, 11). Rapamycin, a well-known inhibitor of mTOR, plays an important role in autophagy and insulin signaling (12, 13) and regulates tau phosphorylation (11, 14, 15). However, the upstream or downstream effectors controlled by mTOR that contribute to changes in neuronal functions and cognitive decline have not been fully elucidated.\nMetal dysregulation, particularly iron, copper, and zinc, is implicated in the development of AD at an early stage (16\u201318 19\u201322). Higher levels of cerebral zinc are observed in postmortem brain tissue from patients with AD (reaching 200\u2013 300 mM) than in healthy controls (23, 24). Zinc is the second most abundant essential trace metal in the brain and is critical for maintaining brain homeostasis (22, 24, 25). Under pathological conditions, the excessive zinc released from synaptic vesicle activation promotes tau hyperphosphorylation (22, 23, 26, 27) in cells (11, 28) and liquid\u2013liquid phase separation of tau protein (29). In addition, previous studies have demonstrated that zinc firmly binds to Ab and was detected inside Ab plaques (30\u201333). In the AD brain, presynaptic neurons release excessive zinc, which causes oxidase activation in neurons and exacerbates pathological development, leading to neuronal death (26, 27, 35, 38).\norg 2\nOxidative stress is an early event in AD and plays an important role in AD pathogenesis (38). Elevated levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS) were detected in postmortem brain tissues from AD patients and animal models of AD (22, 36, 37). Activation of the nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor-2 (Nrf2)/heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) pathway inhibits the progression of inflammation and reduces ROS production and thus has been a potential therapeutic target for AD (39\u201342). There is a vicious cycle formed by excessive zinc, tau, and oxidative stress: elevated levels of zinc raise the production of ROS in mitochondria. Oxidative stress increases zinc concentration and tau hyperphosphorylation. In addition, excessive zinc and hyperphosphorylated tau cause oxidative stress and neurotoxicity. Hyperphosphorylated tau damages microtubule function and induces oxidative stress (43, 44). Increased oxidative stress has been indicated to cause tau hyperphosphorylation (45, 46) and aggravate neuronal death (47). Oxidative stress has been previously shown to be the underlying mechanism for the activation of mTOR in AD (48). However, the underlying mechanism of how excessive zinc links to tau degeneration remains unclear.\nIn the current study, we hypothesized that pathological concentrations of zinc could disturb the rapamycin-dependent mTOR/P70S6K and Nrf2/HO\u20101 pathways, leading to detrimental effects on oxidative stress, tau hyperphosphorylation, and synaptic and cognitive impairment. To this end, we assessed the effect of rapamycin treatment on zinc sulfate (300 mM)-treated SH-SY5Y cells and lateral ventrally injected rats."

Visual cues were positioned above the water level, and extra maze cues were blocked with a dark curtain. During MWM training, all rats were subjected to 4 training trials daily for 6 consecutive days. In each trial, rats were trained to find a hidden platform (20-cm diameter) submerged 1 cm under the water surface for 60 s. Afterward, the rats were kept on the platform for 20 s. If these rats could not seek the platform within 60 s, they were guided to the platform within 60 s and kept on the platform for 20 s afterward. On day 7, a spatial probe trial was executed, where the platform was removed. The escape latency, the total time spent in the target quadrant, the number of platform crossings, and swimming speed were monitored by video tracking software (ANY-maze, USA).\nAfter the behavioral tests, all rats were then sacrificed under deep anesthesia with pentobarbital sodium (50 mg/kg body weight) and transcardially perfused with PBS (pH 7.4).

Zinc sulfate significantly elevated the ratio of phosphorylated mTOR (S2448)/total mTOR by approximately 20%andphosphorylatedP70S6K (T389)/total P70S6K inSH-SY5Y cells (p = 0.046 and p = 0.002, respectively) compared to the control group (Figures 1A, B). Pretreatment with rapamycin (20 ng/ml) abolished the effect of zinc sulfate on the phosphorylated levels of mTOR (S2448) and phosphorylated P70S6K (T389) in SH\u2010SY5Y cells, p = 0.029 and p = 0.001, respectively, in the zinc-treated group compared to the zinc+rapamycin-treated group (Figures 1A, B).\nZinc sulfate significantly elevated the ratio of phosphorylated mTOR (S2448)/total mTOR and phosphorylated P70S6K (T389)/total P70S6K by 44% and 38%, respectively, in the hippocampus of zinc-injected rats compared to control rats (p = 0.025 and p = 0.006, respectively) (Figures 1E, F). Rapamycin treatment attenuated the effect of zinc sulfate on mTOR (S2448) and phosphorylated P70S6K (T389) in rats, p = 0.02 and p = 0.029, respectively (zinc vs. zinc+rapamycin group) (Figures 1E, F).\nNext, we assessed the potential involvement of the Nrf2 and HO\u20101 pathways in zinc-induced alterations using SH-SY5Y cells and zinc-induced rats (Figures 1C, D, G, H). Zinc sulfate (300 mM) significantly reduced the levels of Nrf2 by approximately 70% and HO\u20101 by 30% in SH\u2010SY5Y cells (p = 0.0003 and p = 0.016) (Figures 1C, D).

The expression levels of presynaptic proteins [Synaptosomal-associated 25 kDa protein (SNAP) 25 and synaptophysin] and postsynaptic density protein-95 (PSD95) are indicators of synaptic function. We found that zinc treatment led to reduced levels of SNAP 25, synaptophysin, and PSD-95 in SH-SY5Y cells treated with zinc compared to the control (p = 0.039, p = 0.004, and p = 0.04, respectively).

            "text": "Our data reveal that zinc leads to tau hyperphosphorylation, oxidative stress, and synaptic impairment involving mTOR/ P70S6K activation and Nrf2/HO\u20101 inactivation. Rapamycin ameliorates zinc-induced tau hyperphosphorylation, oxidative stress damage, and synaptic impairment and rescues spatial learning deficits by downregulating mTOR/P70S6K activities and upregulating Nrf2/HO\u20101 activities.\nZinc has been closely related to cognitive function and plays an important role under physiological conditions. Elevated levels of zinc ions were found in AD brains, notably in the hippocampus, cortex, and amygdala, which are severely affected by NFTs (22, 52\u201354).\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 7\nAccumulating evidence has shown a tight relationship of zinc with tau degeneration and cognitive impairment in human patients (55). Dietary zinc supplementation treatment in 3xTg-ADmice has been shown to increase Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels and prevent cognitive deficits and mitochondrial dysfunction (56). The pathological level of zinc promotes tau tangle pathology in the brains of hAPP/htau (57) and taumousemodels (58). Tau transgenic mice are featured by synaptic dysfunction, neuronal loss, neuroinflammation, and impairment in white matter integrity associated with tau accumulation (59\u201364). Abnormal accumulation of targeting metals has been shown to rescue the pathology and phenotype of transgenic mouse models of tauopathy (65).\nIn the present study, we found that excessive zinc could induce mTOR(S2448)-P70S6K(T389)-dependent phosphorylation and tau hyperphosphorylation in cultured neuroblastoma SH-SY5Y cells. Rapamycin suppresses mTOR (S2448)/P70S6K (T389) phosphorylation and ameliorates tau pathology. We found that lateral ventricular injection of zinc sulfate could induce persistent mTOR(S2448)-P70S6K(T389) phosphorylation in the rat hippocampus and that rapamycin reversed both mTOR(S2448) and P70S6K(T389) phosphorylation and reduced the level of tau hyperphosphorylation. These results implied that zinc played a crucial role in tau pathology by regulating the mTOR/P70S6K pathway and that rapamycin exerted a beneficial effect on tau pathology.\nZinc sulfate (300 uM) treatment has been shown inducing cell death. An et al. (28) showed that exposure to 100 mM zinc sulfate for 4 or 8 h caused a 20% reduction in SH-SY5Y cell viability. An et al.

Our results in the current study were in line with a previous finding: 300 mM zinc sulfate treatment induced more than 20% cell death (Figure 7C).\nmTOR or P70S6K is one of the most important serine/ threonine kinases in eukaryotic cells and plays a prominent role in the regulation of protein synthesis, phosphorylation, and autophagy (8, 66\u201370). We have previously shown increased expression of p-mTOR (S2448) and p-P70S6K (T389) in postmortem AD brains, which is associated with the accumulation of hyperphosphorylated tau in AD (10, 11, 71). This suggests that phosphorylation of mTOR at S2448 and P70S6K at T389 is a vital target for disease intervention. Zinc has been indicated to be involved in the mechanisms of mTOR/ P70S6K activation in AD. We have previously shown that zinc treatment (300 mM) promoted tau phosphorylation in vitro in cell cultures (11). Another study demonstrated that synaptic zinc\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 8\npromoted tau hyperphosphorylation (27) and accelerated the fibrillization of mutant DK280 of full-length human tau, inducing apoptosis and toxicity in SH-SY5Y cells by bridging Cys-291 and Cys-322 (72). In addition, zinc binds to protein phosphatase 2A and induces its inactivation and tau hyperphosphorylation through Src-dependent PP2A (tyrosine 307) phosphorylation (73). In ApoE4 transgenic mice, tau hyperphosphorylation is associated with activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase modulated by zinc (74).\nOxidative stress has been recognized as a causative factor in various neurodegenerative diseases (36, 37, 41, 42). Excessive zinc triggers oxidase activation and further generates oxidative products in neurons (22, 24). Pathological tau damages mitochondrial function, resulting in increased ROS products and causing oxidative stress (23, 24, 75, 76). Increased production of ROS causes lipid peroxidation and DNA damage and, in turn, could affect the hyperphosphorylation of tau, leading to a vicious cycle (37, 45, 76\u201378). Here, we investigated the mechanism of zinc-mediated\nA\nB\nC D\nFIGURE 4 | Rapamycin attenuated the zinc-induced increase in the expression of 4-hydroxynonenal (4-HNE) both in vitro and in vivo.

The levels of oxidative products were assessed by immunostaining or Western blot in the present study. We found an increasing level of ROS accumulation in zinc-treated SH-SY5Y cells andmarkedly increased expression of lipid peroxidation product (4-HNE) and nucleic peroxidation product (8-OHdG) in both zinc-induced SH-SY5Y cells and zinc-injected rats. After rapamycin preadministration, the levels of ROS, 4-HNE, and 8-OHdG were decreased in zinc-treated SH-SY5Y cells and zinc-injected rats. Furthermore, we found that increased expression of 8-OHdG, a biomarker of DNA oxidative damage, was significantly colocalized with a mitochondrial marker (TOMM20) in zinc-treated SH-SY5Y cells. The increased expression of 8-OHdG was observed predominantly in the cytoplasm of SH-SY5Y cells, suggesting that zinc induced mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) oxidative damage in SH-SY5Y\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 9\ncells. Mecocci et al. (79) reported that a small amount of DNA significantly increased oxidative damage to nuclear DNA (nDNA) and a highly significant 3-fold increase in oxidative damage to mtDNA in AD compared with age-matched controls. These findings indicate that zinc may induce mtDNA oxidative damage through the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway and that Nrf2/HO-1 pathwayassociated ROS generation may play an essential role in the neurodegenerative process (79\u201382).\nNrf2 is a transcription factor that negatively regulates the level of ROS to protect against oxidative stress damage. Ramsey et al. (83) reported a significant decline in the level of Nrf2 in the brains of patients with AD. Several natural compounds have been shown to reduce oxidative stress in AD models through the Nrf2/HO-1 pathway (84, 85). We found that rapamycin reversed the reduced level of Nrf2/HO-1 in zinc-induced SH-SY5Y cells and rats, in line with previous observations (86).

Caccamo et al. (90, 91) found that inhibition of mTOR by rapamycin could improve learning and memory and reduce Ab and tau pathology in 3\u00d7Tg-ADmice. Chronic treatment with rapamycin enhances learning and memory in young adult mice and improves age-related cognitive decline in older mice, possibly by activating major monoamine pathways in the brain (92). In the present study, we showed increased mTOR/P70S6K signaling in the hippocampus of rats. Rapamycin treatment rescued abnormal mTOR/P70S6K signaling and improved spatial learning in rats. Moreover, we showed that rapamycin treatment reversed the decreased expression levels of synaptic proteins SNAP 25, synaptophysin, and PSD-95 both in cell culture and in rats. Accumulating evidence has shown that rapamycin improves cognitive decline in a mouse model of Down syndrome (13, 93, 94), amyloidosis (J20) (95\u201398), and tauopathy (14, 99, 100). Given the coincident zinc accumulation and mTOR/P70S6K activation in damaged neurons in AD, we confirmed that pathological concentrations of zinc induced cell death and that rapamycin partially recued neuronal death in rats. Thus, rapamycin could exert an early intervention of zinc increases, and mTOR/P70S6K phosphorylation is a promising therapeutic strategy in the treatment of AD. Despite its compelling preclinical record, no clinical trials have tested rapamycin in patients with AD (101, 102).\nManczak and Reddy (103) found that mRNA expression levels were increased in synaptophysin (1.8-fold), synapsin 1 (2.2-fold),\nFrontiers in Immunology | www.frontiersin.org 10\nand synapsin 2 (2.0-fold) in siRNA-Tau cells relative to SHSY5Y cells, while the mRNA expression levels of synaptopodin (1.6-fold) and PSD-95 (1.3-fold) were increased but not significantly. We investigated whether tau phosphorylation is the major cause of presynaptic impairment through the generation of a tau knockout cell line. We showed that the protein levels of SNAP 25, synaptophysin, and PSD-95 in the tau siRNA of SH-SY5Y cells were not significantly increased (p = 0.248, p = 0.0071, p= 0.5105) (Supplementary Figure 2). These findings suggest that reduced tau is beneficial for maintaining synaptic function in SH-SY5Y cells, but the relation is not causal, since the absence of tau would be compensated by microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) (104). Furthermore, Zhou et al. (105) showed that FTDP-17 mutant Tau mislocalized to presynaptic terminals in fly neurons, where it banded synaptic vesicles to elicit presynaptic dysfunction. Di et al. (106) found that in an inducible pseudophosphorylated tau (pathological human tau, PH-Tau) mouse model, low basal levels of PH-Tau (4% of endogenous tau) resulted in significant cognitive deficits, a decrease in the number of synapses in the CA1 region, a reduction in synaptic proteins, and localization to the nucleus.\nThere are several limitations in the study. First, only the MWM test was used to assess the spatial learning function of the rats. Further study using a panel of behavior tests will provide comprehensive insights into the effect of rapamycin on zincinduced cognitive impairment. Second, we focused on the involvement of the mTOR/p70S6K and Nrf2/HO-1 pathways in the current study, while many other pathways have been implicated in the effect elicited by zinc and rapamycin. Moreover, the acute effects of zinc and rapamycin treatment were investigated in the current study.
