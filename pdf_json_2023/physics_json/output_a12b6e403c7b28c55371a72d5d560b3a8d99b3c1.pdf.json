    "abstractText": "\u03b1-Aminophosphonates and related compounds are important due to their real and potential biological activity. \u03b1-Aminophosphonates may be prepared by the Kabachnik\u2013Fields condensation of oxo compounds, amines and dialkyl phosphites, or by the aza-Pudovik addition of the same P-reagents to imines. In this review, the methods that allow for the synthesis of \u03b1aminophosphonates with optical activity are surveyed. On the one hand, optically active catalysts or ligands may induce enantioselectivity during the Kabachnik\u2013Fields reaction. On the other hand, asymmetric catalysis during the aza-Pudovik reaction, or hydrogenations of iminophosphonates, may prove to be a useful tool. Lastly yet importantly, it is possible to start from optically active reagents that may be associated with diastereoselectivity. The \u201cgreen\u201d aspects of the different syntheses are also considered.",

Introduction\n\u03b1-Aminophosphonates form a representative group within phosphonates due to their potential biological activity, enabling them to be used in the pharmaceutical industry [1]. The biological activity is related to the enzyme inhibitory properties of the compounds under discussion. The biological activity includes anticancer and anti-HIV effects, among others. The basic methods for the synthesis of \u03b1-aminophosphonates are the Kabachnik\u2013 Fields condensation and the aza-Pudovik reaction [2]. The phospha-Mannich condensation involves the reaction of an oxo compound, such as an aldehyde or ketone, a primary and secondary amine, and dialkyl phosphite, while the Pudovik approach utilizes the addition of diakyl phosphites to the double bond of imines. As a matter of fact, the imines formed from the oxo compound and the primary amine may be the intermediate of the Kabachnik\u2013Fields reaction. It is a challenge to run the syntheses of \u03b1-aminophosphonates in an enantioselective manner. The stereoselective syntheses of \u03b1-aminophosphonic derivatives were summarized by Ord\u00f3\u00f1ez and colleagues [3], and Palacios et al. [4]. The phospha-Mannich condensation of an oxo compound, amine and >P(O)H reagent may be carried out in the presence of an optically active catalyst or additive to obtain the corresponding product as a predominant enantiomer. The most relevant method for the preparation of optically active \u03b1-aminophosphonates is the enantioselective addition of dialkyl phosphites to the C=N unit of imines [5\u201310]. This is promoted by chiral catalysts or additives. The asymmetric hydrogenation of iminophosphonates is also an attractive method of choice. Lastly yet importantly, the Kabachnik\u2013Fields reactions were performed using optically active amines, aldehydes or phosphites as the starting materials [8\u201311].\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6150. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28166150 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6150 2 of 23\n2.

The enantiomeric purity of the resulting aminophosphonates (1) depended on the substituent in the aromatic ring (Scheme 1) [12]. The highest ee values (90\u201393%) were obtained by starting from 3-methoxyor 4-methylbenzaldehyde or 2-furylaldehyde.\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 26\n2.

The use of triethyl phosphite instead of diethyl phosphite is not advantageous due to the smell and atom efficiency of the condensation reaction.

Enantioselective reductive phosphonylation of acetamide derivatives catalyzed by an iridium complex and a chiral thiourea organocatalyst (90).\nIn this chapter, we collected methods for the synthesis of optically active \u03b1-aminophosphonates that can be obtained by different types of reactions. Each process results in the formation of the desired optically active product using a chiral catalyst. The methods presented, in some cases, may differ from each other. For example, they may differ in the reaction conditions used. A few protocols gave the corresponding optically active products either in good yields, or else only in good enantiomeric purity, but in lower yields. The selection of the best method for the synthesis the corresponding products depends on the substrates. The enantioselective methods demonstrated may be useful in special cases.\n2.5.

There were no data released on the possible re-circulation of the catalysts. Asymmetric catalytic hydrogenation of iminophosphonates is also an attractive synthetic method. It is an elegant approach if one of the components (e.g., the amine or the phosphite) of the Kabachnik\u2013Fields condensation is optically active. Of course, there are special methods as well.
