    "abstractText": "In most carbon dioxide (CO2) capture processes, chemical absorption using an amine solvent is widely used technology; however, the solvent is prone to solvent degradation and solvent loss which leads to the formation of corrosion. This paper investigates the adsorption performance of amine-infused hydrogels (AIFHs) to increase carbon dioxide (CO2) capture by leveraging the potency of amine absorption and adsorption properties of class F fly ash (FA). The solution polymerization method was used to synthesize the FA-grafted acrylic acid/acrylamide hydrogel (FA-AAc/AAm), which was then immersed in monoethanolamine (MEA) to form amine infused hydrogels (AIHs). The prepared FA-AAc/AAm showed dense matrices morphology with no obvious pore at the dry state but capable of capturing up to 0.71 mol/g CO2 at 0.5 wt% FA content, 2 bar pressure, 30 \u25e6C reaction temperature, 60 L/min flow rate, and 30 wt% MEA contents. Cumulative adsorption capacity was calculated and Pseudo-first order kinetic model was used to investigate the CO2 adsorption kinetic at different parameters. Remarkably, this FA-AAc/AAm hydrogel is also capable of absorbing liquid activator that was 1000% more than its original weight. FA-AAc/AAm can be used as an alternative AIHs that employ FA waste to capture CO2 and minimize the GHG impact on the environment.",

            "text": "One of the world\u2019s key focus is to minimize greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions impact on climate resilience and environmental sustainability. GHG such as CO2 accumulate in the atmosphere and cause climate change by trapping heat. The main GHG emission contributors are the transport, manufacturing industries, industrial processes, waste, agriculture sector and energy industries. As of July 2022, statistics from Global Energy Monitor shows there are more than 2215 power plants that actively generate electricity from the burning of coal [1]. A conventional post-combustion capture technology (PCC) used in plants normally utilize amine as the absorbent solvent that binds with CO2. Amine as a solvent is generally used for the removal of CO2 as it has a faster rate of reaction with CO2. However, the main problem related to the use of amine as a solvent for the CO2 absorption is its high cost [2]. The high cost is associated with its regeneration cost which results in only 50% of the solvent at the end. Another problem with amine solvent is it affects operating problems such as solvent degradation, solvent loss and corrosion to the equipment [3]. Adsorption is an appealing method because it requires little energy to regenerate and is easy to process. However, it has limitations when used in high moisture environments and at low pressure conditions, which can affect its capacity and selectivity [4,5]. To improve its performance, amine-functionalized adsorbents were introduced. Amine-functionalized adsorbents are prepared by attaching amines to a porous support, either through in situ\nGels 2023, 9, 229. https://doi.org/10.3390/gels9030229 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/gels\nGels 2023, 9, 229 2 of 16\nformed polymeric amines or impregnation route. Impregnated route adsorbent is created by physically adsorbing amines onto the support, while amine-grafted/covalently bonded systems are made through chemical reaction during synthesis or post-synthesis modification [4]. For instance, Chen et al. (2017) employed a post-functionalization technique to introduce amines into silica and observed that the CO2 adsorption capacity remained stable even after 10 cycles of adsorption [6]. Liu et al. (2019) developed a thermosensitive solid amine CO2 adsorbent by grafted polyethyleneimine (PEI) on the poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) via inverse suspension polymerization and it recorded 3.15 mmol/g of CO2 adsorption at 10 \u25e6C under wet condition [5]. Similarly, Choi et al. (2022) employed the in-situ method to bond hyperbranched poly(amidoamine)s on the ethylenediamine via oil-water-oil suspension polymerization and successfully formed microporous hydrogel particles that exhibited a CO2 adsorption capacity of 104.4 mg/g from flue gas in its dry state. The average pore size of the particles also varies from 2.9 \u00b5m to 1.3 \u00b5m depending on the agitation speed [7]. In another study, Kim et al. (2021) physically impregnated MEA into the dried hydrogel, resulting in an amine infused hydrogel (AIHs) with increased CO2 selectivity in the methane/CO2 mixture gas system compared to bulk MEA solution [8]. White et al. (2021) also utilized the same method to infused the amine into the hydrogel and investigated the use of water and ethylene glycol (EG) as the amine solvent in order to increase the uptake kinetic and minimize solvent degradation after adsorbent recycling. The study found that a combination of EG-diethanolamine resulted in a CO2 capture capacity of 0.75 mol CO2 per mol amine and that the adsorption capacity of the AIHs was highly dependent on the type of hydrogel used, with poly(acrylamide) found to be more effective in capturing CO2 compared to poly(N-2-hydroxythyleneacrylamide) and sodium polyacrylate [9]. Hydrogels, as a solid support, possess unique characteristics such as the ability to retain high amounts of liquid while maintaining their structural integrity through chemical or physical crosslinking of the polymer chains [10]. In order to exploit its potential as a CO2 adsorbent, the properties of hydrogels can be manipulated by infusing amine solvents into the hydrogel matrix. This AIHs can be prepared through the impregnation route, which is a simple and efficient process that reduces both operation time and capital costs [11]. The AIHs act as microcontainers when CO2 molecules diffuse through the surface of the hydrogel and react with the amine solution in-situ. This interaction with CO2 results in the formation of carbamates or bicarbonates. The AIHs exhibit a combination of physical adsorption inherited from the parent adsorbent and chemical adsorption from the loaded amine groups, resulting in a much higher CO2 adsorption capacity when compared to separate microcontainers and bulk amines [12]. Additionally, the use of AIHs technology eliminates the need for extra packing materials, as the hydrogel itself serves as the \u201camine storage and packing\u201d [11]. The utilization of solid support mechanisms in the development of gas adsorbents to minimize the drawback of amine solvent has been a topic of ongoing research for an extended period of time [13\u201318]. However, the use of power plant generated waste, specifically fly ash (FA) as an additive in polymer adsorbents to enhance gas adsorption properties, has not been widely explored in the research literature. Previous FA adsorbent studies primarily focused on the surface treatment of the FA itself and it was proven that chemically treated FA did improve the surface area, morphology, porosity, and adsorbent affinity of fly ash [19]. The enhancement of CO2 adsorption by FA can been done via various methods such as alkaline activator treatment [20,21], conversion of FA into zeolite [22,23] and impregnation of raw FA using amine such as MEA [24]. For instance, this solid waste was transformed into mesoporous adsorbent called silica-alumina composite aerogel with 400 m2/g of active surface area and 1.9 cm3/g of specific pores volume via alkaline fusion and acid leached method of FA. It able to adsorb 2.02 mmol/g of CO2 [25] compared to the pristine FA which only can capture CO2 up to 870.1 \u00b5mol/g FA [20]. FA is the coal power plant byproduct that trapped at the end of the process using precipitator or baghouse [26]. It contains high carbon content, silica dioxide (SiO2) and aluminum oxide (Al2O3) that can\nGels 2023, 9, 229 3 of 16\nfacilitate the CO2 adsorption [20]. Within the last 20 years, an average quantity of 64.8 Mts FA was produced every year by the coal power plant in United State (US) and the highest utilization of FA was only at 60% which is in 2017 [27]. In this work, newly explored FA grafted AIHs was fabricated via direct impregnation of MEA in FA grafted AAc/AAm hydrogel. The impact of FA content, type of hydrogel activator, and operational temperature on CO2 capture was systematically evaluated in order to maximize the CO2 adsorption capacity. To gain a deeper understanding of the CO2 adsorption mechanism of MEA-infused FA grafted AAc/AAm hydrogels, adsorption kinetic model analysis was performed using five different kinetic models. The results of this work suggest that the utilization of FA to enhance the adsorption properties of amine-infused hydrogels is a promising area for future investigation."

In this study, the coal FA that obtained from local power station recorded the chemical composition of silicon oxide (SiO2), aluminum oxide (Al2O3) and iron oxide (Fe2O3) were 78.58 wt%, which indicated that the currently used FA was classified as a Class F FA as described in ASTM C618. The Class F FA contains more than 70% of Al2O3, SiO2 and less than 10% of CaO. While some analysis reported that the composition of SiO2 and Al2O3 can be up to 55% and 35% respectively [28,29]. The properties of the FA are highly dependent on its composition especially silicon (Si). High amount of silicon is able to contribute to high mechanical strength and adsorption capacity of the synthesized material [30,31]. On the other hand, the FA will be categorized as Class C if the total of Al2O3, SiO2 and ferrite is less or equal to 50% of the total FA composition and the composition of CaO is more than 10% [29].\nFigure 1 shows the particle size distribution of raw FA. The particle size distribution of the FA was measured by the laser diffraction particle size analyzer. The particle size of FA ranged from 0.55 to 440 \u00b5m with median, D50 of 15.37 \u00b5m, D90 90% of the particles size was 122.95 \u00b5m and span of 7.82. According to Nath et al., the size of filler is one of the most important factors that might affect the mechanical properties of the composite materials. Frequently, nanofiller with a size of 2 nm to 50 nm was used in synthesizing the composite hydrogel [32\u201334]. Large-sized filler might create a weak point in the material [35]. Several reports found to utilize raw FA in its pristine state without grinding and sieving [35,36].\n2.1.2. Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR)\nFigure 2a shows the FTIR spectrum of FA.

Despite the high adsorption of water creating more void within the hydrogel adsorbent, the use of amine as the activator was found to be more effective in adsorbing CO2, supported by the slightly higher kinetic rate of the 100 wt% MEA-infused hydrogel. Thus, it is reasonable to assume that pure amine infused hydrogel would be more efficient in capturing CO2 than one infused with water. Meanwhile, the adsorption capacity shows a significant increment with the use of 30 wt% of MEA solution. It also can be inferred that an increase in the concentration of MEA leads to an increase in the kinetic rate, indicating a faster reaction with CO2. However, with the presence of water in amine solution, 1 mol of MEA now can react with 1 mol of CO2 and form bicarbonate, as shown in Equation (3), resulting higher CO2 adsorption capacity.\nCO2 + H2O\u2194 HCO3\u2212 + H+ (1)\nCO2 + 2 HOC2H4NH2 \u2194 HOC2H4NHCO2\u2212 + HOC2H4NH3+ (2)\nCO2 + HOC2H4NH2 + H2O\u2194 HCO3\u2212 + HOC2H4NH3+ (3)\n2.2.3.

However, it decreased to 0.53 and 0.49 mol/g at 45 and 60 \u25e6C, respectively.

It is noted that the use of different amine, starting monomer, filler or polymerization technique will give different properties to the adsorbent. For instance, MEA-hydrogel with the dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTAB) surfactant showed an adsorption of 2.96 mmol/g [8]. Meanwhile, silica that functionalize with 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane (APTES) via wet grafting method able to capture CO2 up to 1.67 mmol/g [45]. Another example of amine infused adsorbent is APTES functionalized aluminosilicate; which came from metakaolin and silica fume. The study successfully absorbed 1.17 mmol/g of CO2 and the adsorbent also exhibited low adsorption and desorption energy of 14.47 and 51.05 kJ/mol [46]. The concept of incorporating amine in solid adsorbent has been established for some time, but the search for the best adsorbent in term of sorption capacity, industrial pliability and sustainable for a long run should be continue with more material to be explored."

            "text": "The FA-AAc/AAm hydrogel was synthesized via in-situ solution polymerization and hydrogel activator was infused by direct impregnation method in which the hydrogel was immersed in the water or MEA solution for 24 h. The morphology of the hydrogel featured less visible pores but demonstrated a high capacity for hydrogel activator absorption. It is suggested that the amine absorption properties of the hydrogel are also influenced by the functional groups present. The incorporation of fly ash into AIHs was found to effectively improve CO2 adsorption. At a temperature of 30 \u25e6C and pressure of 2 bar, the use of 0.5 wt% of FA increased CO2 adsorption by 54% compared to neat AIHs. Data from this study were best simulated by the pseudo-first order > Avrami fractional > pseudo-second order > Elovich > Weber-Morris kinetic models, as supported by the SSE value. It can be inferred that the rate of change in CO2 uptake with respect to time is directly proportional to the difference in saturation concentration and the amount of solid uptake. However, the Avrami fractional kinetic model cannot be completely disregarded due to only 0.99% difference in SSE between both kinetic models. Although the hydrogel material is stable at high temperature up to 380 \u25e6C, the breakthroughs analysis suggest that the adsorption of CO2 is not favorable at high temperatures. As a result, to optimize the adsorption capacity of the amine infused FA-AAc/AAm hydrogel, it is recommended to lower the flue gas temperature prior to the adsorption. Further optimization studies, such as varying the FA composition, FA particle size, type of amine solution, operational pressure, and increasing\nGels 2023, 9, 229 12 of 16\ntemperature, are also recommended in order to maximize CO2 capture. With further exploration of these remaining factors, this easily synthesized AIHs has the potential to become a commercially viable adsorbent for CO2 capture."

Preparation of MEA Infused FA-AAc/AAm Hydrogel Adsorbent\nThe amine infused hydrogel was synthesized by solution polymerization using com-\nmon monomers, acrylic acid (AAc) and acrylamide (AAm). The schematic illustration of\nsynthesis process and CO2 adsorption is shown in Figure 10. The synthesis process started\nby diluting 5 g of AAm into 100 mL distilled water. The solution was then combined with\nsieved FA ranging from 0.5 wt% to 2 wt%. The stirring continued for another 20 min with\ntemperature maintained at 60 \u00b0C. Then, 0.5 g of AAc and 0.05g of N,N\u201d-methylene\nbisacrylamide (NMBA) as cross-linking agent were introduced to the solution while the\nmixture was continuously stirred. The initiator, 0.25 g of ammonium peroxodisulphate\n(APS) was added after 30 min. The FA-AAc/AAm hydrogel was dried at 55 \u00b0C for 8 h in\nthe vacuum oven before it was infused with activator namely water, 100 wt% monoeth-\nanolamine (MEA) and 30 wt% MEA solution.\nThe elemental composition of raw FA was analyzed by energy dispersive XRF (X-ray\nfluorescence spectrometry, Shimadzu XRF-1700, Tokyo, Japan) according to BS EN ISO\n12677:2011 method. The sampling of FA was conducted by taking the FA from five differ-\nent sampling points. The FA was ground using a planetary ball mill to obtain the particle\nsize of less than 100 \u00b5m prior to mounting into the sample holder.\nMalvern Instrument Mastersizer 3000 was used to determine the particle size distri-\nbution (PSD) of FA before and after the ball-mill grinding. FA samples were analyzed in\ntriplicates and an average result recorded. The particle refractive index and adsorption\nindex was set at 1.6 and 1.0, respectively.\nThe functional groups of raw FA and the effect of incorporation of FA on the hydro-\ngel matrices was determined using FTIR spectra model Perkin-Elmer Spectrum One,\nFTIR-frontier. The FTIR spectra was determined at wavenumber ranges, scan number per\nsample and wave resolution of 4000-500 cm\u22121, 16 and 4 cm\u22121, respectively. The hydrogel\nsamples were prepared using vacuum oven-dried for 5 h at 50 \u00b0C. The pellets for FTIR\nanalysis were prepared from a uniform mixture of hydrogel and potassium bromide\n(KBR) using a steel die. KBr was used as the sample carrier because its optically transpar-\nent properties would not impose any absorbance interference to the IR ray."

Referring to Equations (9) and (10), kid represents the kinetic rate constant. The Elovich kinetic model was initially applied in gaseous systems to predict the mass and surface diffusion, activation and deactivation energy of the system. Referring to Equations (11) and (12), \u03b1 is initial adsorption rate and \u03b2 is desorption constant. The Avrami fractional kinetic model is a fractional kinetic with order one for particle nucleation and applicable for describing the adsorption of multicomponent gases by solid adsorbent [25]. In Equations (13) and (14), ka is the Avrami rate constant, and n is the Avrami exponent which use to reflect the dimensionality of crystal growth [47]. The CO2 adsorption capacity data of 30 wt% MEA infused 0.5FA-AAc/AAm hydrogel was used to fit into all these models and determine the most suitable kinetic model to explain the kinetic behavior of CO2 adsorption of MEA infused hydrogel adsorbent.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, N.E.R. and K.J.; methodology, S.M.M.G., A.R.A.R. and R.K.; formal analysis, S.M.M.G.; investigation, S.M.M.G. and R.K.; resources, N.E.R. and K.J.; data curation, S.M.M.G.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, S.M.M.G.; writing\u2014review and editing, A.A.S.; visualization, S.M.M.G.; supervision, N.E.R.; project administration, N.E.R.; funding acquisition, N.E.R.
