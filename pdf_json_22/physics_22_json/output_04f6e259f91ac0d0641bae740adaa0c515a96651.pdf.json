    "abstractText": "Quantum storage and distribution of entanglement are the key ingredients for realizing a global quantum internet. Compatible with existing fiber networks, telecom-wavelength entangled photons and corresponding quantum memories are of central interest. Recently, Er ions have been identified as a promising candidate for an efficient telecom quantum memory. However, to date, no storage of entangled photons, the crucial step of quantum memory using these promising ions, Er, has been reported. Here, we demonstrate the storage and retrieval of the entangled state of two telecom photons generated from an integrated photonic chip. Combining the natural narrow linewidth of the entangled photons and long storage time of Er ions, we achieve storage time of 1.936\u03bcs, more than 387 times longer than in previous works. Successful storage of entanglement in the crystal is certified using entanglement witness measurements. These results pave the way for realizing quantum networks based on solid-state devices.",

Compatible with existing fiber networks, telecom-wavelength entangled photons and corresponding quantum memories are of central interest. Recently, 167Er3+ ions have been identified as a promising candidate for an efficient telecom quantum memory. However, to date, no storage of entangled photons, the crucial step of quantum memory using these promising ions, 167Er3+, has been reported. Here, we demonstrate the storage and retrieval of the entangled state of two telecom photons generated from an integrated photonic chip. Combining the natural narrow linewidth of the entangled photons and long storage time of 167Er3+ ions, we achieve storage time of 1.936\u03bcs, more than 387 times longer than in previous works. Successful storage of entanglement in the crystal is certified using entanglement witness measurements. These results pave the way for realizing quantum networks based on solid-state devices.\nThe quantum internet1,2\u2014in synergywith the internet thatwe use today \u2014promises an enabling platform for next-generation information processing, including exponentially speed-up distributed computation, secure communication, and high-precision metrology. For fiberbased quantum networks, the distance over which entanglement can be distributed is limited to around 100 km, due to losses in the optical fiber. The quantum-communication efficiency can be greatly enhanced, however, by harnessing quantum-repeater architectures3\u20137. The key building block of such architectures is quantum memory, wherein photonic quantum states are stored in quantum states of matter. Quantum memories have been realized with atomic ensembles8\u201312, single atoms13\u201317, and solid-state systems18\u201327. For the integration of these elements into a quantum network, three general criteria have to be met7,28,29: (1) wavelength compatibility with existing telecom networks (i.e., the natural choice for the level transition in the storage device should be around 1.5\u03bcm for low-propagation loss of photons in fiber); (2) long storage times; and (3) multiplexed storage capability. One of the most promising candidates for realizing such a memory are solids doped with rare-earth ions. Several recent experiments on rare-earth ions with long hyperfine lifetimes, such as praseodymium or europium, have established the potential to realize practical memories by demonstrating storage in long-lived spin states30\u201332, multimode storage28,32,33, high efficiencies34,35 and long storage times36,37. However, none of the above-mentioned ions have suitable optical transitions in any of the telecom bands; nonetheless, flying photon at telecom wavelength can be realized either by frequency conversion10,11,17,38\u201340 or entanglement heraldingwith frequency non-degenerate photon-pair sources19,20,41\u201345. The erbium ionhasoptical transitions in the telecomband around 1536nm. However, the small ratio of spin lifetime to optical lifetime limits its performance as telecom quantum memories46,47. Nonetheless, previous pioneering works showed the storage of entangled states for 5 ns48, and the storage of heralded single-photon state for about 50ns49,50. Recently, there is a rising interest in isotopically purified rare-earth ions due to their long coherence time compared with unpurified ions25,51\u201354. Ran\u010di\u0107 et al.51 showed that in a high magnetic field, 167Er3+ ions with I = 7/2 possess a hyperfine coherence time of 1.3 s and efficient spin pumping of the ensemble into a single hyperfine\nReceived: 17 August 2023\nAccepted: 20 October 2023\nCheck for updates\n1National Laboratory of Solid-state Microstructures, School of Physics, College of Engineering and Applied Sciences, Collaborative Innovation Center of Advanced Microstructures, Nanjing University, 210093 Nanjing, China. 2Synergetic Innovation Center of Quantum Information and Quantum Physics, University of Science and Technology of China, 230026 Hefei, Anhui, China. 3Hefei National Laboratory, 230088 Hefei, China. 4These authors contributed equally: Ming-Hao Jiang, Wenyi Xue. e-mail: Xiaosong.Ma@nju.edu.cn\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:6995 1\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\nstate. This seminal work triggered a recent resurgence of interest in using erbium ions for quantum memory, e.g., for on-chip storage of telecom-band classical light at the single-photon intensity level55, for efficient initialization using the resolved hyperfine structure for quantum memories56, and for on-demand storage of weak coherent light with laser-written waveguides57. The next milestone of quantum memory in this system is to store quantum entanglement in 167Er3+ ions and show that entanglement is preserved after storage.\nHere, we demonstrate the storage and retrieval of the entangled state of two telecom photons in 167Er3+ ions. The entangled photon pairs are generated from an integrated photonic chip based on a silicon nitride (SiN) microring resonator, with natural narrow linewidths compatible with 167Er3+ ions. A storage time of 1.936\u03bcs is achieved, 387 times longer than inpreviousworks.

As shown in Fig. 1a, the output of a continuous-wave pump laser is chopped by an intensity modulator (IM) into pulses. These pulses are then further amplifiedwith an erbium-doped fiber amplifier (EDFA). Several wavelength-division multiplexers (WDM) are used to clean the spectrumof the pulses, which are subsequently injected into the \u201cIn\u201d port of the SiN DMZI-R resonator (Fig. 2a). A pair of telecom-wavelength photons that are non-degenerate in frequency, signal and idler photons, are generated from the resonator and coupled out from the \u201cDrop\u201d port. Signal and idler photons are then separated with a WDM. The remaining pump pulses are coupled out from the \u201cThrough\u201d port and detected with a photodiode (PD). We use the detected power signal to monitor the frequency drift between the resonance of the DMZI-R and the pump65. The additional \u201cAdd\u201d port is used for calibrating the DMZI-R resonance conditions. The unique structure of the DMZI-R source allows us to independently tune the coupling between the waveguides and the ring resonator for the pump pulses, signal, and idler photons. In this way, the pump laser and generated photon pair are coupled at different ports to reduce the on-chip and in-fiber Raman noise generated from the strong pump66\u201369.

The AFC laser is locked to a Fabry\u2013P\u00e9rot cavity (F\u2013P cavity) using the Pound\u2013Drever\u2013Hall (PDH)\ntechnique. The 167Er3+: Y2SiO5 crystal is placed in a dilution refrigerator equipped with a superconducting magnet. The time sequence of photons and lasers is controlled by the optical switch, optical shutter and acousto-optic modulator (AOM), see text and Supplementary Note 1 for details. c Time-bin qubit entanglement analyzer consists of two unbalanced Franson interferometers and three Superconducting single-photon detectors (SSPD). The interferometers are phase stabilized with proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers by using a fraction of pump laser as reference light (Ref).\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:6995 2\nCavity-enhanced spontaneous parametric down-conversion has been employed as photon-pair source for rare-earth quantum memory, providing narrow-band photons compatible with the memory in the absence of any in-band narrow-band filters70. The transmission spectrum of this DMZI-R source is shown in Fig. 2b. The quality factors of the signal (about 1536nm), pump (about 1538 nm) and idler (about 1540nm) wavelengths are around 1.05 \u00d7 106, 0.92 \u00d7 106, and 1.06 \u00d7 106, respectively. Cavity-enhanced spontaneous four-wave mixing (SFWM) processes enable us to generate high-quality telecom entangled photonswith high brightness andnarrow linewidth,which are the essential requirements for telecom-compatible quantum memory. Figure 2c shows the coincidence histogram for a 2.9mW pulsed pump, with a coincidence window of about 4 ns. The full width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the coincidence peak is 1370 ps, which corresponds to a coherence time of 997 ps and 980ps for the idler and signal photons, respectively71,72 (see Supplementary Note 3 for details). These photonpair coincidence results are consistent with the linewidth of the classical transmission spectrum. To characterize our source, we further measure the coincidence counts (C.C.) rate and the coincidence-toaccidental ratio (CAR) as a function of average pump power with continuous wave (CW) and pulsed pump, shown in Fig. 2d, e, respectively. When we increase the pump power, due to the nature of SFWM, on one hand, we observe the enhancement of coincidence counts; on the other hand, high-order photon pairs reduce the CAR.\nIn the pulsed-pump case, the output of pump laser is chopped with the IM intopulseswith a 4-ns pulsedurationand a 32-ns period. By using these pump pulses, we generate time-bin entangled qubit state:\n\u03a6j i= eej i+ ll , \u00f01\u00de\nin which ej i and l represent early and late temporal modes of the single photons, respectively. Photon pairs generated by the DMZI-R are time-bin entangled and the pair-creation time is uncertain within the coherence time of the pump laser. In order to analyze the twophoton entanglement, we send them into two Franson interferometers73. Each interferometer has two unbalanced optical paths, where the temporal difference between two optical paths is ~32 ns. Note that there are two timeparameters that need to be treated carefully: the first one is the time difference between optical paths of one interferometer, \u0394T, which needs to match the period of the pump pulses and be larger than the single-photon coherence time; the second one is the difference between this parameter for two interferometers, \u0394T1 \u2212\u0394T2, which needs to be smaller than the coherence time of the signal and idler photons. We fulfill both requirements by adjusting the pump-pulse period and accurate fiber splicing for both Franson interferometers. We scan the phase of the two unbalanced interferometers by tuning the setpoints of the two proportional-integral-derivative (PID) phase-locking systems for them, and obtain the two-photon quantum interference for the full 2\u03c0 period, as shown in Fig. 2f. For entanglement analysis, we use the average pulsed-pump power of about 2.9mW, where the CAR decreases to about 12.3. The visibilities (V = max minmax + min) for these two curves are 78.0 \u00b1 0.4% and 70.5 \u00b1 0.5%. The nonideal visibilities are mainly due to the high-order photon pairs generated from the SFWM process, and the phase fluctuations of the Franson interferometers. To confirm the high-order photon-pair emission\u2019s impact on visibilities, we reduce the average power of the pulsed pump to 1.4mW, and obtain visibilities of 84.8 \u00b1 0.3% and 86.4 \u00b1 0.3% (see Supplementary Note 2 for details). The phase fluctuations of the Franson interferometers are mainly due to the frequency instability of the partial pump laser used as the reference for PID locking (Fig. 1c).\nC .C\n. r at\ne (H\nz)\n-3 -2 -1 0 1 2 3 0\n200\n400\n600\n800\n\u03c4i = 997 ps \u03c4s = 980 ps\n\u03c4 (ns)\na\n1535 1536 1537 1538 1539 1540 1541 1542 1543 1544 1545 \u03bb (nm)\n0\n1\n1\n1\nN or\nm al\niz ed\ntr an\nsm is\nsi on\nIn-Through Add-Drop In-Drop\nSignal, FWHM = 185 MHz\nexp. fit\nIdler, FWHM = 183 MHz\n.\n-2000-1000010002000 Detuning (MHz)\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\n1 Pump, FWHM = 212 MHz\nSignal\nIdlerPump\nPump\nSFWM\n-2000-1000010002000 Detuning (MHz)\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\n1\n-2000-1000010002000 Detuning (MHz)\n0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8\n1\n0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 On-chip pump power (mW)\n0\n2000\n4000\n6000\n8000\n10000\nC .C\n. r at\ne (H\nz)\n0\n50\n100\n150\nC AR\nPulse\n0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 3.5 On-chip pump power (mW)\n0\n2000\n4000\n6000\n8000 10000 C .C . r at e (H z)\n0\n50\n100\n150\nC AR\nCW\nfdc\nb\ne\n0 100 200 300 Phase (\u00b0)\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\nC .C\n.

            "text": "The quantum memory is a 50 ppm doped 167Er3+: Y2SiO5 crystal, which is cut along its D1, D2, and b axes with dimensions of 4 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 9mm3. A photon-echo-type interactionusing an atomic-frequency comb (AFC)74 enables the quantum state to transfer between the single photon and the ensemble of 167Er3+ ions. To create an AFC, we use the optical pumping technique to shape the absorption profile of the ionic ensemble into a comb-like structure. The input photon is then absorbed and re-emitted into a well-defined spatial mode because of a collective rephasing of the ions in the AFC. The period of the comb determines the re-emission time and can be reconfigured.\nHerewe use the 167Er3+ ions at site 1, with the 4I15/2\u2192 4I13/2 transition at ~ 1536.17 nm. 167Er3+ exhibits eight hyperfine spin states due to a nuclear moment of I = 7/2 (see Fig. 3a). The crystal is placed inside a dilution refrigerator equipped with a superconducting magnet. The pump laser and signal photons propagate along the b axis of the crystal. Amagneticfieldof about 1.5 T is applied in theD1\u2013D2 planewith an angle of about \u03b8 = 120\u00b0 to the D1 axis for a large ground-state Zeeman splitting. The crystal\u2019s temperature is about 230mK, deduced from the thermal-equilibrium population between Zeeman ground levels as a function of magnetic field strength (see Supplementary Note 4 for details). In this case, the ground-state Zeeman splitting is about 50 times kBT, so that the electron spin is frozen to me = \u2212 1/2, ensuring long lifetimes and coherence times51.\nTo improve the storage efficiency, a polarization laser is applied to enhance the absorption depth by polarizing the nuclear spin before AFC preparation. The polarization is performed partially because the transitions of \u0394mI = \u00b1 1 and \u0394mI = 0 cannot be resolved55,57. This is because the inhomogeneous broadening of our sample is larger than the hyperfine splitting. The ions are pumped away from \u201con\u201d hyperfine states (resonant with the laser) and stored on \u201coff\u201d hyperfine states (off-resonant with the laser). Consequently, the population is still distributedover eight hyperfine states, but the spectrumprofile of optical absorptions has been changed. We show the whole absorption spectrum in Fig. 3b, in which the polarization laser scans from about 550\u2013750MHz blue shifted from the center of the AFC, creating a pit there and consequently enhancing the absorption depth of the AFC. In our experiment, the magnetic field slightly deviates from the D1\u2013D2 plane, lifting the degeneracy of the two classes of 167Er3+ ions. To create the desired AFC profiles, we modulate the intensity of the AFC laser into pulses with a period equal to the storage time tM. Its frequency spectrumwill be a combwith 1/tMperiodmodulated by a sinc function whosemain peak\u2019s envelop spans about 200MHz. A close view of AFC is shown in Fig. 3c, compared with the spectral lineshape of the input signal photon, which shows the bandwidthmatching betweenAFC and the signal photon. In Fig. 3d, we show the zoom-in views of AFC spectrum for 336 ns (upper blue) and 1936 ns (lower red) storage times with frequency periods of about 3MHz and 0.5MHz, respectively.\nIn the lower panel of Fig. 3d, we obtain a lower AFC contrast for data of 1936 ns. One limitation is the narrowest tooth width of AFC, which is about 0.25MHz in this work. When the AFC\u2019s period is comparable with or narrower than the toothwidth, the AFC contrast will be limited. The narrowest spectral features could be limited by residual frequency jitter of the AFC laser and power broadening in spectral hole burning processes. For the details on the optimization of storage time, see Supplementary Note 5.\nIn order to store the heralded single photon, we align the central frequency of the signal photon with respect to that of the quantum memory. To achieve that, we first coarsely tune the frequency of the photon-pair source by adjusting the temperature of the DMZI-R source. The DMZI-R resonance is sensitive to temperature, which is monitored with a thermistor, and stabilized with a thermoelectric cooler with feedback control. The resonance between the pump laser and the DMZI-R is maintained with a feedback loop by monitoring the remaining pump power at the through port65. Another knobwe have is the magnetic field applied to the quantum memory. We vary the magnetic field amplitude to tune the Zeeman splitting and hence the optical transition frequency of 167Er3+ ions. We present a typical result for the frequency alignment in Fig. 4a.We show the single counts (S.C.) of the signal (blue) and idler (red) photons as a function of the magnetic field amplitude. The clear drop of counts of signal photon shows thematching of the absorption frequency of the memory with respect to that of the signal photon. However, it is also important to have a stable count rate for idler photon, as the drop of signal-photon counts can also come from the frequency drift of the pump laser with respect to the DMZI-R. Only by observing the drop of signal-photon counts and, simultaneously, the constant idler-photon counts, we are certain that frequency alignment of the resonance of 167Er3+ ions and the signal photon has been achieved. For a more precise alignment of signal photon to the AFC, we scan the pump laser\u2019s frequency for SFWM generation and the voltage on the on-chip resistors in finer steps to tune the frequency of the signal photon for achievingmaximal storage efficiency, with the magnetic field fixed to 1.5 T. A typical result of 1936 ns storage time is shown in Fig. 4b.\nAfter achieving the frequency alignment, we proceedwith storage of the heralded signal photons. The time sequence of signal photons and lasers is controlled by the optical switch and optical shutter, with a 1.8-s polarizationwindow, a 1.9-s AFCpumpwindow, a 0.2 s delay and a 1-s memory window. An acousto-optic modulator (AOM) is inserted to gate the idler photons in synchronization with the memory window (see Supplementary Note 1 for details). In Fig. 4c, we show the coincidence histograms for different predetermined storage times of 1296 ns, 1616 ns, and 1936 ns. The 32-ns period of the side peaks is due to the periodic pulses of the pump laser, which creates accidental coincidence (AC) counts.

The memory efficiencies for various storage times and experimental settings are shown in Fig. 4d, indicating an efficiency of about 2% for 1936 ns storage. Note that all results presented in this article are without any subtraction of background noise or AC counts.\nThe maximum number of temporally multiplexed modes is approximately equal to the time-bandwidth product (TBP)74, which is the storage time divided by the time width of the stored photons. In this work, the TBP is about 1936 ns/4 ns = 484. The realized mode number is 60.5, with 32 ns repetition time and 1936 ns storage time. One limitation here is the 32 ns repetition time, which is equal to the time difference of each unbalanced interferometer and should be larger than the single-photon coherence time, as discussed above. This can be solved by either coding the qubits on other degrees of freedom\n(such as polarization), or still using time-bin qubits but with time multiplexing, in which the \u201cearly\u201d mode of N time-bin qubits can be inserted before the the \u201clate\u201d mode of the first qubit, thus enhancing the mode capability by a factor of N77."

In Fig. 5a, we show the histogram of coincidence between output port 1 for the signal photon and the output port for the idler photon. There are five peaks spanning from 1900 to 1980ns.

By using two Franson interferometers for the re-emitted signal photon and the not-stored idler photon, we select the central peak (at 1936 s) to verify the entanglement between them. The coincidence counts (C.C.) between idler photons and port 1 of the Franson interferometer for signal photons are shown in solid/dashed blue curves for a phase of 0/180\u00b0, respectively.bThe coincidence counts between idler photons and port 2 of the Franson interferometer for signal photons are shown in solid/dashed red curves\nfor the phase of 0/180\u00b0, respectively. Complementary counts at the same phase setting are clearly seen from in (a, b), as expected for interferometric measurements. c Full-period interference fringes show the coherence of the entangled state of Eq. (1). We scan the phase of the two Franson interferometers and obtain twophoton quantum interference for the full 2\u03c0 period.

The other two peaks are the accidental coincidencepeaksmentioned above. The results in Fig. 5a, b are integrated in 40,000 s. Furthermore, we scan the phase of the two unbalanced interferometers by tuning the setpoints of the two PID phase-locking systems (see Supplementary Note 7 for details), and obtain two-photon quantum interference for the full 2\u03c0 period at 1936 ns storage time, as shown in Fig. 5c.\nAn entanglement witness78 is employed to determine whether entanglement exists. The existence of entanglement is proved by determining a negative expectation value of the witness operator. The witness used here is given by\nW\u0302 = 1 2 z + z z + z + z z + z z + + x + x x + x + x x + x x +\ny+ y y+ y\ny y+ y y+ , \u00f03\u00de\nwhere z + = ej i, z j i= l , x \u00b1 = ej i\u00b1 l and y\u00b1 = ej i\u00b1 i l 78,79. Projections onto the X\u2013Y plane can be obtained from the visibility of the Franson interference. Combined with the results for Z basis (Fig. 4d) when the unbalanced interferometers are removed, the expectation valueof thewitness canbe calculatedusing (see SupplementaryNote 8 for detailed derivation):\nWh i= 1 g2si\u00f00\u00de+2 V 2 : \u00f04\u00de\nThe results of entanglement witness measurements are shown in Table 1, where all values are below the separable boundary of 0, by more than 23 standard deviations. Therefore, our results unambiguously show the successful storage of entangled photons in a crystal for 1936 ns."

            "text": "Our results represent a significant advancement of quantum memory system. First, we show the storage of entangled photons in 167Er3+: Y2SiO5, a quantum memory at telecom wavelength, which is a promising candidate for realizing an efficient, long storage time and broadband quantummemory51,55\u201357. In our work, we have extended the storage time of entangled photons at telecom wavelength more than 387 times longer than previous work48. Second, we show a successful combination of quantum memory with an integrated quantumentanglement source, which generates narrow-band entangled photons, is CMOS compatible and hence suitable for scalable fabrication, and easier touse than sources basedonbulk optics.Weemphasize that the scalable entangledphoton-pair sourcesweusehere are essential to absorptive quantummemory. Unlike emissive quantummemories80,81, each absorptive quantum memory requires an entangled photon-pair source. A scalable platform for entangled photon-pair sources is particularly important when a quantum network with multiple entangled photon sources and quantum memories with spatial mode multiplexing are constructed.\nDespite these important results, there are several aspects that need to be further improved in our system. To improve the storage efficiency, one could optimize the AFC parameters74,82 with more\nefficient initialization protocols with a resolved, long-lived hyperfine structure51,56, and enhance the light-matter interactions with impedance-matched cavity83 and integrated nano-structures55,57,84\u201386. The atomic-frequency comb spin wave protocol will facilitate the realization of a quantum memory with longer storage time and ondemand readout. One such possible protocol was recently demonstrated with Kramers ions in 171Yb3+: Y2SiO5\n53. The level structure of 167Er3+ is more complicated than 171Yb3+, which requires more complicated optical pumping and coherent control pulse sequences. On the other hand, the rich level structure of 167Er3+ may also bring new possibilities in quantum engineering of photon-atom interactions. With these experimental improvements, we anticipate 167Er3+ ions and integrated quantum photonics to become a versatile platform for highperformance quantummemory, enabling the realization of large-scale quantumnetworks.Wenote that during the completionof this project, related work has shown the storage of heralded single photons in Erdoped fiber for up to 230 ns87."
