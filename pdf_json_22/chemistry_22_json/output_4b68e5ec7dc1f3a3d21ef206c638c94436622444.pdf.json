About 50% of plastics are intended to be used only once and are known as single-use plastics (SUPs).1 Due to the non-biodegradability, most SUP waste such as packaging bags and water bottles are disposed of in landlls2 or incinerated.3 However, landlling occupies a lot of land and space, while burning waste releases many pollutants that affect people living near these incinerators. Furthermore, these methods lead to the loss of valuable resources. Recent research shows that the thermal cracking technique is a promising method to effectively reuse and recycle plastic waste since it can transfer plastics into valuable products such as fuels and chemicals while minimizing the volume of plastic waste and decreasing CO2 emission.4 Moreover, the product\nineering, Guangxi University, Nanning, .

ZSM-5 is commonly manufactured with pure raw materials, e.g. sodium aluminate, aluminium oxide and aluminium nitrate as the aluminium sources, and silica sol, ethyl orthosilicate and sodium silicate as the silicon sources.6 Moreover, the extensive use of organic structure directing agent lead to the rise in the production cost. New synthetic routes of ZSM-5 have been developed using cheaper raw materials such as kaolin,7 coal gangue,8 diatomite,9 red mud10 and slag11 and inexpensive structure directing agents (e.g. activated carbon, glucose, cellulose etc.) to reduce the production cost.\nRed mud (RM) is a solid waste produced from the alumina rening of bauxite ore. The annual worldwide output of RM has been estimated to reach more than 120 million tons.12 The major issues with the disposal of RM are the high alkalinity (with pH of 10\u201313) and its very ne grain size (<10 mm). RM particles are too ne and easily y away with the slight breeze, and thus easily cause air pollution.

For instance, many techniques including acid leaching, solidstate carbo-thermic reduction, magnetic and uidized bed separation, alkali fusion\u2013acid leaching process have been applied to recover valuable elements such as Fe, Ti and Al from RM.13 However, these processes involve secondary environmental pollution or high energy consumption, consequently restricting their large-scale industrialization application. Other techniques have been developed to utilize RM as construction materials, adsorbent materials,14 catalysts and coagulants.15 This expanded to some extent the utilization of RM. The high content of aluminium in RM suggests that RM is a potential aluminium resource for synthesizing zeolite molecular sieves. The presence of Fe, Ca and Ti in RM could help to generate new acidic or basic active sites in the RM-based zeolites.\nNotably, the alkali fusion method can destroy the complex structure of coal y ash (CFA) and activate CFA, and eventually improve the leaching efficiency of rare earth elements in CFA.16 Alkali fusion is also considered to be the most effective for RM because the excess alkali in RM don't need to be removed out and can be directly used, and the metal components in RM e.g. Fe, Ca and Ti can be conserved, as well as secondary sewage discharge can be avoided.\nIn the present study, ZSM-5 was economically synthesized with alkali-fused RM and cheap industrial sodium silicate. The inexpensive glucose was used as a mesopore template instead of organic ammonium. The roles of glucose as template on the crystallization reaction and acidity as well as the pore structure of zeolites were investigated via experimental analysis. The effects of Fe and Ca in RM on the structure and acidity of the resultant ZSM-5 were analyzed with the help of density functional theory (DFT) calculation. The catalytic performance was investigated by catalytic cracking of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and waste plastics. We aim to develop a cost-effective synthesis method of ZSM-5 to promote the utilization of solid wastes e.g. RM and waste plastics."

RM mainly contains Fe, Ca, Al, Si and a small quantity of Ti and Na. The alkali fusion process led to a large decrease in the concentrations of all metal elements except for Na. The RMZSM contains mainly Si, Fe, Ca, Al and Na, and the real SiO2/ Al2O3 mol ratio is 21.9, far lower than the designed value in the starting materials (120). This indicates that a considerable amount of silicon could dissolve in the synthesis solution and fail to enter the zeolite framework.\nAs shown in Fig. 1(a), the virginal RM contains hematite (PDF-33-0664), cancrinite (PDF 46-1332), aluminium silicate (PDF-44-0027) and calcite (PDF-47-1743). AF-RM mainly contains sodium aluminate (PDF-20-1073), sodium silicate (PDF-16-0818), and a small quantity of hematite. Cancrinite, calcite and hematite almost disappear aer alkali fusion, indicating that Ca and Fe components could transfer into very small nanoparticles or amorphous particles upon undergoing alkali fusion treatment.\nFig. 1(b) shows the XRD patterns of zeolites from different templates.

Fig. 1(c) shows the pH changes during the crystallization process of RM-ZSM. The pH decreases rapidly at the rst 4 h, and then gradually increases with extending crystallization time. The large pH decline could be attributed to glucose's degradation and isomerization reactions, which release acidic components e.g. lactic acid and glycotic acid.23 The pH decline could cause sodium silicate unstable to transfer into polysilicate, which helps the subsequent crystallization reaction.24,25 Apparently, glucose plays an important role in adjusting the synthesis mixture's pH value and promoting the crystallization reaction.\nIn order to clarify the roles of glucose, other saccharides including fructose, cellulose, starch, and lactic acid were used to substitute for glucose.

Three RM-ZSM show a strong absorbance band at 250 nm due to the oxygen-to-iron charge transfer, indicating the Fe species incorporated into the zeolite framework.

The total energy and M\u2013O bond lengths for the most stable structure of each model can be calculated through the self-consistent iteration approach of VASP.28 The calculated substitution energy (substitution of one Si atom in ZSM-5 cell by Fe or Ca) and adsorption energy (adsorption of one [FeO]+ or CaO in the pore) are shown in Table 2.\nAs can be seen in Table 2, Fe\u2013O bond lengths for two kinds of skeleton coordinated Fe are slightly larger than the average bond length of ZSM-5 (1.7 A), while Ca\u2013O bond lengths for two kinds of skeleton coordinated Ca are much longer than 1.7 A. Therefore, Ca atoms could easily lead to the deformation of the framework once they enter the skeleton of ZSM-5. Among three forms of Fe atoms, the substitution energy for skeleton four coordinated Fe is the lowest, suggesting that Fe atoms are more prone to enter into the framework of ZSM-5 via isomorphous replacement. Due to the low substitution and adsorption energy, part of the Fe atoms could exist as skeleton three coordinated Fe and the adsorbed [FeO]+. In contrast, the\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

The above results indicate that Fe atoms distribute in zeolites in many forms, while Ca atoms are mainly adsorbed in the pores of zeolites."

As shown in Fig. 6(a) and (b), all synthesized ZSM-5 mainly contain weak and medium acid. The total acid amounts of CaZSM and Fe-SZM are lower than that of ZSM-5, indicating that the loading of metal oxides has a hampering effect on the formation of the skeleton of zeolites. FeCa-ZSM shows a broader medium acid range, implying that the incorporation of Fe and Ca adjust the acid strength distribution. The total acid amount increases in the order: RM-ZSM-1.8 < RM-ZSM-3.6 < RM-ZSM5.4, demonstrating the template role of glucose.

The band at 1442 cm 1 is attributed to the L acid sites, mainly derived from the isolated AlO+ and metal sites (Fed+ and Cad+) on zeolites, being an electron pair acceptor (combining pyridine in a coordination bond form). The band at 1490 cm 1 is attributed to the vibration of the pyridine ring on both B and L acid sites.27 As can be seen in Table 4, the concentrations of L acid sites for all metal-loaded zeolites are much higher than those of B acid sites, and the\nites.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

The Fe loading could introduce not only a number of L acid sites but also dehydrogenation active sites, consequently improving the aromatization reaction.

The optimal WHSV was 0.8\u20131.6 h 1.\nThe cracking performance of RM-ZSM-3.6 was compared with those on the original RM and quartz sand (thermal run). As shown in Fig. 9, RM-ZSM-3.6 achieved a lower liquid yield but relatively higher gas yield (85%) and light olens selectivity (77%). RM only showed a slight effect on generating gas products compared to quartz sand. This nding was consistent with a previous work.41 In another study, ZSM-5 (SiO2/Al2O3 \u00bc 50) and RM were tested in pyrolysis of a mixture of plastics with a semi-batch reactor.42 The obtained liquid yield at 500 C was 39.8 wt% for ZSM-5 and 57 wt% for RM. The BTEX selectivity reached 41% for ZSM-5 and 27.4% for RM. Both ZSM-5 and RM showed a signicant aromatization activity. This is very different from our study, may be attributed to the fact that the composition of RM varies with the specic process from which it is obtained.\nIn addition, the different properties of the used catalysts (SiO2/Al2O3 ratio, acidic properties and porous structure) and the differences on reaction devices could affect the product yield and selectivity.

The selectivity of monoaromatics and C5\u2013C12 alkanes/olens reached 100% over Al2O3 followed by ZSM-5 relay catalysis at 550 C.43 In Lee's study, H-ZSM-11 zeolite was used to valorize plastic waste (LDPE) to fuel-range chemicals.44 Compared with non-catalytic pyrolysis, H-ZSM-11 greatly enhanced the pyrolytic gas yield (80% at 500\u2013600 C), especially the propylene in the pyrolytic gas. This was consistent with our results.\nIn view of saving energy, the reaction temperature was xed at 500 C in this study, which is the lowest temperature to satisfy demand for pyrolysis of polyolen plastics. In this case, the product selectivity is mainly dependent on the acidic properties of catalysts. From our results, the catalyst with stronger acidity trends to produce more liquid products with aromatics as the predominant components, while the catalyst with weaker acidity trends to produce more gas product with light olens as the dominant components. Based on the gaseous and liquid products from the present study and the results from current literature,35\u201339 the cracking and aromatization reactions paths of polythene are proposed as follows: polymer rstly decomposes thermally to produce large hydrocarbons (mainly wax, diesel and gasoline products) via random chain scission reactions (free radicals mechanism), and these large hydrocarbons are"

            "text": "The stability of the catalysts was determined by continuously cracking a self-made waste plastic sample at 500 C for 300 min over RM-ZSM-3.6 and Commer-ZSM. Gaseous and liquid products were collected and analyzed per 15 min. As shown in Fig. 10(a) and (b), RM-ZSM-3.6 achieves a gas yield of about 90%, which begins to decline aer 165 min and reaches 70% aer 300 min. Meanwhile, Commer-ZSM obtains a gas yield about 80%, which gradually decreases to 70% aer 300 min. The light olens (C]2\u20134) selectivity in gaseous products reaches about 70\u201380% for RM-ZSM-3.6 and 15\u201320% for Commer-ZSM.\nFig. 10(c) and (d) show liquid yield and BTEX selectivity from cracking of waste plastics. For Commer-ZSM, the YL maintains at 20 30%, and BTEX selectivity reaches 80% during whole reaction. For RM-ZSM-3.6, the YL is 10% at the initial stage and then gradually increases up to 30% aer 165 min, while BTEX selectivity decreases from 73% to 20.5%. The acid sites on RMZSM-3.6 could be covered by coke, which leads to the decrease\n22172 | RSC Adv., 2022, 12, 22161\u201322174\nin cracking and aromatization activity of the catalyst. As a result, the cracking intermediate products could not be further cracked into small molecules and converted into aromatics.\nLight olens and monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are important industrial chemicals. Commer-ZSM is demonstrated to be suitable for producing monocyclic aromatics, while RMZSM-3.6 is the ideal catalyst for producing gaseous products, especially ethylene and propene. The product selectivity is dependent on the chemical and physical properties of catalysts. Compared to the Commer-ZSM, the stability of RM-ZSM-3.6 should be further improved for long-term application by promoting zeolite's crystallinity and decreasing the impurity in waste plastics."

The pH decline caused by glucose degradation leads to sodium silicate unstable to form the polysilicate, which accelerates the crystallization reaction. Glucose dehydrates in alkaline environment to produce carbon nanoparticles, which could serve as themesopore template. Fe atoms can distribute in ZSM-5 in many forms (partly in the framework, partly adsorbed in the pores of zeolites), and help to generate L acid sites in zeolites.

The presence of Ca and Fe atoms weakened the acidity of resultant zeolites, which eventually enhanced the formation of gaseous products (yield: 85.3%), especially light olens (selectivity: 77.1%). The long-term cracking experiment indicates that RM-ZSM-3.6 is superior in converting waste plastics to light olens (ethylene and propene) than the commercial ZSM-5. The present study represents a green chemical process with economic and environmental benets: (i) transferring solid wastes (RM and waste plastics) into useful materials, and (ii) developing an economic and nonpetroleum route for the production of light olens."
