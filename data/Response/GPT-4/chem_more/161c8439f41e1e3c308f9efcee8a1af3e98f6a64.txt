Development of Standardized Protocols for MP Extraction Across Different Matrices: Given the study's focus on digested sewage sludge, there's a clear opportunity to expand this work by developing and validating similar extraction protocols tailored for other environmental and technical matrices, such as soils, sediments, freshwater and marine ecosystems, and even air. This would help in harmonizing MP research and facilitating comparisons across studies.

Long-term Stability and Degradation of MPs in Various Environmental Conditions: The study demonstrated that the chemical structure of most MPs remained stable through the extraction process. Future research could explore the long-term stability and potential degradation pathways of different types of MPs under various environmental conditions (e.g., UV exposure, microbial activity) to better understand their fate in the environment.

Impact of Microplastics on Soil and Plant Health: Leveraging the developed extraction protocol, research could investigate the presence and effects of MPs in agricultural soils, focusing on their impact on soil health, crop growth, and plant uptake. This would provide valuable insights into the broader ecological consequences of MP pollution.

Efficiency of Wastewater Treatment Technologies in Removing MPs: While the study reported MP removal efficiencies in wastewater treatment plants, there's scope for evaluating the performance of emerging and advanced treatment technologies in removing MPs of various sizes and types. This could include the exploration of innovative filtration materials, biotechnological approaches, and chemical treatments.

Human Health Implications of MPs in Food and Water: Considering the presence of MPs in drinking water and the potential for MPs to accumulate in food chains, future research could focus on quantifying MP exposure in humans through diet and drinking water. Additionally, studies could investigate the toxicological effects of MPs, especially those of smaller sizes that might be ingested or inhaled, to assess potential health risks.
