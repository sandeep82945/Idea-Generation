The portion of the text that mentions future research directions is as follows:

"In assumption (ii), we regard renewable generations as negative loads. In fact, they are also potential reserve providers with stochastic generation upper bounds, and there are several existing pilot explorations on integrating them into AS markets in the U.S., see [33] for a survey. However, their market participation models are still unclear as discussed in [33] and cannot be fully addressed as a part of this paper. Therefore, we will leave it for our future work."

"Due to the page limit, this problem cannot be addressed as a part of this paper, which is a possible limitation of this work and will be left for our future research."

"These discussions on detailed market rules are all related to the ISO’s surplus from organizing the market. Unfortunately, revenue adequacy of the ISO cannot be guaranteed under the proposed market design, which is a possible limitation of this work. One main reason is that the property typically lies beneath the dispatch and pricing given by one single procurement model, whereas the market-clearing decisions over the scheduling period are somehow separately generated by a sequence of look-ahead optimizations in this paper. In general, this is an intractable problem for all rolling-window-based market approaches. Another reason is that the settlement of possible re-dispatch, which naturally influences the ISO’s surplus in the look-ahead stage, somehow depends on the result of the subsequent real-time market if the proposed framework performs as an intermediate market step instead of the terminal one. In the real world, the ISO is not likely to be able to obtain perfect oracles on the real-time market outcome from a look-ahead perspective, let alone the fact that the ISO’s look-ahead decision itself would also influence the real-time result. Such paradoxes cannot be fully addressed as a part of this paper and will be left for our future work."
