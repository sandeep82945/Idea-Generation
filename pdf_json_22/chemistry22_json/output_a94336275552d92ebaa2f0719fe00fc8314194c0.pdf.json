    "abstractText": "cis-(+)-12-Oxophytodienoic acid (OPDA) is a reactive oxylipin produced by catalytic oxygenation of polyunsaturated \u03b1-linolenic acid (18:3 (\u03c9 \u2212 3)) in the chloroplast. Apart from its function as precursor for jasmonic acid synthesis, OPDA serves as a signaling molecule and regulator on its own, namely by tuning enzyme activities and altering expression of OPDA-responsive genes. A possible reaction mechanism is the covalent binding of OPDA to thiols via the addition to the C=C double bond of its \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl group in the cyclopentenone ring. The reactivity allows for covalent modification of accessible cysteinyl thiols in proteins. This work investigated the reaction of OPDA with selected chloroplast and cytosolic thioredoxins (TRX) and glutaredoxins (GRX) of Arabidopsis thaliana. OPDA reacted with TRX and GRX as detected by decreased m-PEG maleimide binding, consumption of OPDA, reduced ability for insulin reduction and inability to activate glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and regenerate glutathione peroxidase (GPXL8), and with lower efficiency, peroxiredoxin IIB (PRXIIB). OPDAylation of certain protein thiols occurs quickly and efficiently in vitro and is a potent post-translational modification in a stressful environment.",

            "text": "Three chloroplast enzymes convert \u03b1-linolenic acid (18:3 (\u03c9\u22123)) to cis-(+)-12-oxophytodienoic acid (OPDA) [1,2]. OPDA is exported from the chloroplast to the cytosol possibly employing the inner envelope protein OPDAT1 [3] and the outer envelope channel JASSY [4]. Following import into the peroxisome, OPDA reductase 3 (OPR3) and three cycles of \u00df-oxidation generate jasmonic acid (JA) [1,2]. An alternative route uses cytosolic OPR2 for the reduction of 4,5-didehydro-JA [5]. Apart from being a precursor for the plant hormone jasmonic acid, OPDA functions as a signaling compound and regulator of plant processes by two mechanisms, as reversibly binding ligand and as reagent covalently modifying target proteins at exposed cysteinyl thiols. An example for the OPDA function as a ligand is the chloroplast cyclophilin 20-3 (CYP20-3), which upon reversible binding of OPDA associates with the cysteine synthase complex and activates synthesis of O-acetyl-serine from serine, the precursor for cysteine synthesis, by serine acetyltransferase [6]. Reversibility of OPDA association with CYP20-3 independent of thiols was demonstrated by titrating free thiols after incubating CYP20-3 with thiol reactive compounds such as methyl vinylketone and OPDA [7]. While thiols of CYP20-3 were blocked with vinylketone, they remained reactive in the presence of OPDA.\nAntioxidants 2022, 11, 855. https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox11050855 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/antioxidants\nAntioxidants 2022, 11, 855 2 of 22\nOn the other hand, cyclopentenone moieties-containing compounds react with thiols of glutathione and cysteine, but also cysteinyl thiols exposed on protein surfaces [7\u20139], similar to prostaglandins of the cyclopentenone type, such as 15dPGJ2 and PG-A1. D\u00fcckershoff et al. [8] infiltrated Arabidopsis thaliana leaves with 100 \u00b5M OPDA or phytoprostanes for 6 h and identified 66 polypeptides with altered abundance in 2D gels by comparative image analysis and mass spectrometric identification. Among these proteins were 13-LOX 2, CYP 20-3, thioredoxin m4 and peroxiredoxin Q. Infiltration of biotinylated PG-A1 followed by affinity purification failed to unequivocally identify proteins, but nevertheless confirmed the binding of PG-A1 to many polypeptides. Furthermore, the authors showed OPDAylation of recombinant glutathione-S-transferase GST1 and GST6 [8]. In a subsequent analysis, OPDAylation was also shown for the transcription factor TGA2 at Cys186. However, this Cys was not needed for transcriptional activation of TGA2-dependent genes [9]. This pioneering proof of concept of OPDAylation defined starting points and identified present day limitations. Exogenous application of oxylipins likely establishes different subcellular oxylipin concentrations and, therefore, different polypeptides may be OPDAylated qualitatively and quantitatively in this approach with exogenous feeding compared to the in vivo situation. The 2D gel-based identification of target polypeptides combined with the, at that time, available mass spectrometry only focused on abundant proteins. Shibata et al. [10] demonstrated the electrophilic character and reactivity of 15d-PGJ2 and its ability for covalent binding to human TRX-1. Incubation of SH-SY5Y cells with 25 \u00b5M or 50 \u00b5M 15d-PGJ2 induced oxidative stress as visualized by 2\u2032,7\u2032-dichlorodihydrofluorescein fluorescence. Overexpressing TRX1 decreased the oxidative stress in the cells treated with 15d-PGJ2 [10]. Covalent modification of protein thiols by reaction with OPDA was termed OPDAylation [7] in analogy to the nomenclature of other post-translational modifications such as glutathionylation or sumoylation. Maynard et al. reported preliminary evidence that chloroplast TRX-f1 incubated with OPDA is OPDAylated in vitro, and that OPDAylated TRX-f1 loses its function to reductively activate chloroplast fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, one of its preferred targets [7]. The possibility of OPDAylation of proteins of the redox regulatory network in plants has not been addressed in any detail. For this reason, this study on protein thiol reactivity with OPDA was designed with focus on central elements of the redox regulatory network of the cytosol and chloroplast. Protein thiols play decisive roles in adjusting protein activities. Diverse post-translational modifications occur on cysteinyl thiols, e.g., disulfide formation, sulfenylation, sulfinylation, sulfonylation, S-nitrosylation, S-glutathionylation and persulfidation [11]. Cys modification alters protein function and this mechanism was denominated Cys or thiol switch. In plants thiol switching plays a profound role in regulating various processes in different subcellular compartments and this research area is an expanding field [12]. The regulatory thiol-redox network consists of functional proteins that can be grouped into the categories of redox input elements, redox transmitters, redox targets and redox sensors [13]. Redox transmitters comprise TRX and glutaredoxins (GRX) which have evolved to large gene families in plants with multiple functions [14,15]. TRXs function in both directions of target protein regulation, namely as disulfide reductases and dithiol oxidases [16]. In the light of the central function of TRXs and GRXs in process regulation, it is important to understand whether and by which mechanisms their activity might be controlled apart from gene expression. This work builds on the described evidence from work with 15d-PGJ2 and its ability to bind to human TRX1 [10] and the preliminary data on chloroplast TRX-f1 [7] and aimed to explore the propensity of other TRXs to react with OPDA and to become OPDAylated. Selected A. thaliana plastidic and cytosolic TRXs and GRXs were treated with OPDA and scrutinized for OPDAylation. Results from mPEG-maleimide binding, reduction assays with insulin, OPDA consumption, an activation test for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and the reductive regeneration of glutathione peroxidase such as protein (GPXL)\nAntioxidants 2022, 11, 855 3 of 22\nand type II peroxiredoxin in H2O2 peroxidase tests showed the effect of OPDAylation on these activities."

OPDA Effect on mPEG-Maleimide-Reactive Thiols\nThe first set of experiments aimed at investigating the reaction of OPDA with protein thiols using four different TRXs, the chloroplast TRX-f1 and TRX-m4 and the cytosolic TRX-h3 and Trx-h5, as well as the cytosolic GRX-C2. The electrophoretic mobility shift assay following the reaction of accessible thiols with mPEG-maleimide (mPEGmal) relies on an increase in molecular mass which slows down the migration in the SDS-PAGE. Figure 1 reveals the separation of TRX-h3 and -h5 at the expected molecular mass of 15 kDa. In the absence of OPDA, reaction with mPEGmal shifted the prominent band to about 60 kDa. After preincubation with 150 \u00b5M OPDA prior to the mPEGmal treatment, the prominent band migrated at about 40 kDa. Lower binding stoichiometry of mPEGmal indicates that at least one cysteinyl thiol was blocked by OPDAylation. Additionally, the band at about 25 kDa increased in intensity. This result is interpreted that TRX-h3/5 had bound a second OPDA molecule. A similar pattern could be observed for TRX-f1 and GRX-C2 with the 25 kDa band being the most prominent one. Separation of TRX-m4 resulted in only three bands at roughly 17 kDa, 27 kDa and 40 kDa, irrespective of the treatment. Again, the band at roughly 27 kDa was the most intense one for protein incubated with 12-OPDA, while the intensity of the 40 kDa band intensified in the control sample. The results supported the conclusion that TRX thiols readily react with OPDA. Therefore, we addressed the disulfide exchange activity of TRXs and GRX-C2 with the established insulin reduction test.\nAntioxidants 2022, 11, 855 7 of 22\nAntioxidants 2022, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 21\ninterpreted that TRX-h3/5 had bound a second OPDA molecule.

Upon reduction, insulin denatures and tends to aggregate, a process that can be monitored in a spectrophotometer, e.g., multiplexed in a microtiter plate reader. Bovine insulin remained in solution in the absence of TRXs or precipitated very slowly after the addition of low DTT concentrations (Figure 2). Addition of TRX-f1, -m4, -h3 and -h5 accelerated the aggregation rate and the absorbance passed the threshold of \u0394A650 nm = 0.3 within a short time period. GRX-C2 was less efficient in insulin reduction than TRXs. In the presence of GRX-C5, the time needed to reach the threshold did not differ from the reaction without any protein. The redox transmitters were incubated with 150 \u00b5M OPDA prior to the insulin reduction test. After pretreatment with OPDA, the increase in absorbance and the time period needed to pass the threshold occurred highly delayed, indicating that OPDA binding to the redox transmitters inhibited their disulfide reduction activity and ability to reduce insulin. This effect was scrutinized in a time- and concentration-dependent manner using TRX-h3. After 1 h of OPDA treatment, the threshold was reached after 16.3 \u00b1 0.37 min, compared to the control reaction (TRX-h3 incubated with EtOH), which passed the threshold after 3.98 \u00b1 0.16 min.

The reduction assay of insulin disulfides is an established test for redox transmitter activity [21]; however, beyond the evidence for disulfide reduction ability, the test fails to provide physiologically relevant information. The data show that TRXs are efficient and GRXs only have a low disulfide reduction activity since their main function is catalysis of deglutathionylation [29]. GRX-C2 displayed a low disulfide reduction activity which was also sensitive to OPDA treatment, while GRX-C5 was inactive. OPDA quantification after reaction with TRX gave a third line of evidence for a stoichiometry of two OPDAylated thiols per polypeptide in the case of TRX-h3 and -h5 and three in the case of TRX-f1 and -m4 under close to physiological OPDA concentrations (Figure 3). It should be noted that these assays were conducted with only a 2-fold or 4-fold molar ratio. In the light of three thiols/TRX, the efficiency of OPDA binding to TRX-f1 and -m4 is remarkable, whereas the third thiol of TRX-h3 and -h5 appeared less prone to OPDAylation. Mass spectrometric analysis proved the attachment of up to two OPDA molecules to each TRX-h3 entity (Figure 4)."

The reconstitution assays of the GPXL8- and PRX-IIB-dependent H2O2 reduction assay and the activity test of GAPC2 further evidenced the selectivity and specificity of OPDAylation. Plant glutathione peroxidases function as TRX-dependent thiol peroxidases [30,31]. The KM values for TRX-h3 and TRX-h5 of 0.58 and 0.67 \u00b5M, respectively, demonstrate the high efficiency of the TRX-GPLXL8 system in detoxifying peroxides. The KM values are in the range of the expected TRX concentrations in the cytosol.\nAntioxidants 2022, 11, 855 19 of 22\nThe addition of OPDA to the complete GPXL8 system strongly inhibited the H2O2 reduction (Figure 6) with measurable differences to control at very low physiological OPDA concentration, namely 1 \u00b5M. This experimental setup did not allow for pinpointing to the specific effect of OPDA on each component. The preincubation of individual components revealed that the cytosolic TRX-h3 is particularly sensitive to inactivation by OPDAylation and controls the detoxification rate under these conditions (Figure 7). This is in line with the high sensitivity of human TRX-1 toward inhibition by reacting with the cyclopentenone moiety-containing 15d-PGJ2 [10]. In the PRX-dependent assay, PRX-IIB appeared significantly more prone to OPDAylation and OPDA-dependent inhibition than GRX-C2 and glutathione reductase (Figure 9). However, the extent of inhibition, even at 7.5-fold excess of OPDA, was low in comparison to the effect on TRX. It would be interesting to explore whether other reactive carbonyl species may react with PRXs and may serve as regulators. The 1,3-bisphosphoglycerate oxidation activity of GAPDH displayed OPDA sensitivity as well, but similar to PRXIIB, the extent of inhibition was rather small and only non-physiologically high OPDA concentrations inhibited GAPC2 to a major extent (Figure 11). This low sensitivity of GAPC2 to OPDA-dependent inhibition surprises in the light of the significant inhibition by H2O2. However, GAPDH plays additional roles in cell signaling and displays moonlighting functions in gene expression regulation, control of post-transcriptional processes and signaling [32]. Thus, OPDAylation might affect other protein functions, e.g., in protein\u2013 protein interactions. Despite the differences in OPDA sensitivity of various recombinant proteins, these in vitro experiments indicate the high potential of OPDAylation as a significant posttranslational modification. Apparently, TRXs and possibly PRXs might be prime targets for this kind of regulation. On the other hand, the here described differential sensitivity of protein thiols to OPDAylation has a high potential for specificity in OPDA-dependent regulation under stress."

            "text": "OPDA is synthesized in the chloroplast and exported to the cytosol and then peroxisome for further processing to jasmonic acid [1,2]. Peroxisomal OPDA reductase 3 (OPR3) is likely key to eliminating the reactive \u03b1, \u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl group in the cyclopentenone ring [33]. Dueckershoff et al. [8] considered the half life time of OPDA in vivo in the presence of typical glutathione concentrations of 1 mM and suggested a value of about 28 min. Upon wounding, herbivore attack, high light and other stress impact, OPDA contents increase to several \u00b5mol/kg fresh weight. The only important parameter for the here described OPDAylation reaction is the effective concentration of OPDA in the stroma and cytosol. Considering the subcellular volumes and the share of the chloroplast containing mesophyll cells to total fresh weight of leaves, OPDA under stress may be estimated to reach cytosolic and stromal concentrations above 10 \u00b5M in mesophyll cells. The assumed half life time of OPDA in the presence of physiological GSH concentrations does not take into account that certain protein thiols may have a particularly high reactivity toward OPDA, as shown in this work for certain TRX and possibly PRX isoforms. Therefore, the release of OPDA may affect redox homeostasis and accumulation of reactive oxygen species in the cell, which may synergistically activate defense programs [12,34]. The strong effect of external feeding of OPDA on the quantum yield of photosystem II, and chlorophyll, protein and free thiol contents of leaf discs is an indication for the strong interference of OPDA with leaf metabolism. Based on the finding of this research, the likely cause for the inhibition of quantum yield even in the dark is the high reactivity of OPDA with thiols and damage to decisive functions in the photosynthetic electron transport chain. The loss of chlorophyll in the illuminated leaf sample indicates that the impaired functionality of the photosynthetic electron transport chain sensitized the chlorophyll for\nAntioxidants 2022, 11, 855 20 of 22\nlight-dependent bleaching. The bleaching was not seen in the darkened sample despite similar inhibition of photosynthesis. However, at present it remains unknown whether this effect is due to the conversion of OPDA to jasmonic acid or is caused by the reported functions of OPDA as reactive \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated carbonyl and signaling molecule on its own. Jasmonic acid is reported to induce protein and chlorophyll degradation in some plants such as barley [35]. In any case, there appears to be a threshold between \u226425 and \u226550 \u00b5M OPDA where the possible tuning activity, e.g., via OPDAylation of sensitive thiols, turns into a general toxicity as witnessed in the leaf disc assays."

            "text": "The covalent association of OPDA with protein thiols, termed OPDAylation, appears to be a potent post-translational modification in plant stress response. The work presented here reveals the high reactivity of OPDA with certain protein thiols in vitro at low physiologically relevant OPDA concentrations. The reported half life time of about 28 min in plant cells needs to be re-evaluated in the light of this high reactivity of certain protein thiols. The subcellular pools of OPDA, i.e., free, electrostatically or covalently bound forms, need deeper scrutiny under stress such as wounding or high light treatment. Our focus on H2O2-detoxifying thiol peroxidases and the observed inhibition indicate that OPDAinduced accumulation of reactive oxygen species might be linked to OPDAylation of TRX isoforms and peroxiredoxins. The increasing sensitivity of proteomics technology and the improved evaluation methodology for identifying novel post-translational modifications such as OPDAylation under stress provide a promising perspective to gain further insight into the impact of OPDAylation in living plant cells [36]. It will be of interest to compare the relative reactivity of OPDA with other plant TRXs and TRX-fold proteins as well and to elaborate on the features that facilitate OPDAylaton of thiol-containing proteins. This study investigated the spontaneous reaction of protein thiols with OPDA. It would be interesting to explore whether OPDAylation may also be catalyzed by enzymes.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/antiox11050855/s1, Table S1: Oligonucleotide primers used for molecular cloning of the coding regions of the Arabidopsis proteins.
