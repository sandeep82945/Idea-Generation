Introduction\nImage processing is a subset of signal processing that focuses on images and videos. All procedures done on an image in order to increase readability and facilitate interpretation are referred to as image processing. In the industry, image restoration is an important topic. This is a fundamental problem in a variety of applied sciences, including medical imaging [1] [2], microscopy and astronomy [3], film restoration, and image and video coding [4] [5]. Image restoration is an interesting subject in image processing since it occurs at the very beginning of the acquisition chain and involves recovering a clean original image from a degraded image [3] [2].\nBy applying a proximal algorithm to solve a minimization problem, we propose a unique technique for image restoration. It is believed that an original image has been deteriorated by additive noise.\nWe are attempting to rebuild u from the image we have seen Im (which is therefore a degraded version of the origi-\nnal image u). The maximum likelihood technique leads us to seek u as a solution to the following optimization problems, assuming that the additive noise is Gaussian:\nP \u03b1\u2254 arg min u\u2208Uad 1 2 Im \u2212 u 22 , 1\nwhere Uad the admissible set is determined by\nUad \u2254 u \u2208 BV \u03a9 , J u \u2264 0 , 2\nand J u represents the total variation in u as specified by\nJ u \u2254 sup \u03a9 u x div \u03c6 x dx \u03c6 \u2208 C1c \u03a9,\u211d 2 , \u03c6 \u221e \u2264 1\n3\nTotal variation regularization (TV) is a regularization term J u = D u that allows for discontinuous solutions.\nHindawi Journal of Applied Mathematics Volume 2023, Article ID 6689311, 15 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2023/6689311\nBecause of its capacity to include \u201cjumps\u201d in the solution, it has become particularly popular for image rendering. The space of bounded variation function is known as BV. It is characterized by\nBV \u03a9 \u2254 u \u2208 L1 \u03a9 , J u < +\u221e 4\nTo tackle this problem, we will apply the proximal penalty approach (Aujol [6]; Micchelliy, Shenz, and Xux [7]). To accomplish this, we state the method\u2019s idea. The fact that the problem P is equivalent to the problem P \u03b1e is the principle behind it.\nP \u03b1\u2254 arg min u\u2208Uad 1 2 Im \u2212 u 22\n\u21d4 P \u03b1e \u03b1e \u2254 arg minu\u2208BV 1 2 Im \u2212 u 22 +\u03a8Uad u , 5\nwhere \u03a8Uad indicates the U ad indicator function defined by\n\u03a8Uad u \u2254 0 if u \u2208Uad ,\n+\u221e otherwise 6\nDefinition 1. [7] We denote by \u211dd the usual d-dimensional Euclidean space.\nLet \u03c8 be a real-valued convex function on \u211dd . For all x \u2208\u211dd , the proximal operator of \u03c8 is defined by\nprox x \u2254 argmin 1 2 u \u2212 x 22 + \u03c8 u : u \u2208\u211d d 7\nWe give the following three examples.\nExample 1. If \u03bb > 0 and x \u2208\u211d, then\nprox1/\u03bb x =max x \u2212 1 \u03bb , 0 sing x 8\nExample 2. If \u03bb > 0 and x \u2208\u211dm, then\nprox1/\u03bb 1 x = prox1/\u03bb x1 , prox1/\u03bb x2 ,\u22ef, prox1/\u03bb xm t ,\n9\nwith t is the transpose of a line vector.\nExample 3. If \u03bb > 0 and x \u2208\u211dm, then\nprox1/\u03bb 2 x =max x 2 \u2212 1 \u03bb , 0 x x 2\n= prox1/\u03bb x 2 x x 2\n10\n2. General Principle of the ProximalPenalty Methods\nAccording to [8\u201312], the following is the general principle of the proximal-penalty methods:\n(1) Replace the problem P with the problem P r that has no constraints\nP r \u03b1r \u2254 arg minu\u2208BV \u03c6 u, r = 1 2 Im \u2212 u 22 + r max 0,\u03a0K u\n11\nThe penalty coefficient is r whith r > 0. The external penalty function is known as h where h u =max 0,\u03a0K u , and \u03a0K u is the projection of u in K where\nK \u2254 div \u03c6 x : \u03c6 \u2208 C1c \u03a9,\u211d 2 , \u03c6 \u221e \u2264 1 12\nWhen r\u27f6 +\u221e , the obtained solution u r is a solution of P .\n(2) We begin by selecting a penalty coefficient r1 and then solve the problem without constraints\nP r1 \u03b1r1 \u2254 arg minu\u2208BV \u03c6 u, r1 = 1 2 Im \u2212 u 22 + r1 max 0,\u03a0K u ,\n13\nlet u r1 be the obtained point.\n(3) The stop test: u r1 is a good approximation of the optimum if the amount r1h u r1 is sufficiently small; otherwise, a penalty coefficient r2 > r1 will be determined and the following new problem will be solved without constraint P r2\nThe problem is linked to\nP r w \u03b1r w \u2254 arg min u,w \u2208BV2 1 2 Im \u2212 u 22\n+ r max 0,\u03a0K u + 1 2 u \u2212w 22\n14\nThe relaxation algorithm transforms and generates a sequence uk,wk k such that uk+1 is a solution to the problem when we applied to this problem.\nP r wk \u03b1r w k \u2254 arg min\nu\u2208BV 1 2 Im \u2212 u 22\n+ r max 0,\u03a0K u + 1 2 u \u2212wk 2 2 ,\n15\nand the solution of the problem is wk+1\nP r uk+1 \u03b1r w \u2254 arg minu\u2208BV 1 2 Im \u2212 u 22\n+ r max 0,\u03a0K uk+1 + 1 2 uk+1 \u2212w 2 2\n16\nAs a result, a simple iteration uk+1 solves the following problem:\nP r uk \u03b1r \u2254 arg minu\u2208BV 1 2 Im \u2212 u 22 + r max 0,\u03a0K u + 1 2 u \u2212 uk 2 2\n17\n3.

The following are some historical notes:\n(i) Bregman was the first to adopt this distance measurement in 1967 [13]\n(ii) Censor and Lent created and developed the concept [14]\n(iii) In 1976, Bregman devised a simple and effective method for using the Dg function in the design and analysis of feasibility and optimization algorithms. This has spawned a burgeoning field of research in which Bregman\u2019s technique is used to create and analyze iterative algorithms for nonlinear applications, not only to address feasibility and optimization problems but also to solve variational inequalities and calculate fixed points. More information can be found in the sources [15] [16] [17].\nDefinition 3 (Bregman projection). Let g X\u27f6 \u2212\u221e,+\u221e be a lower semicontinuous smooth convex function.

Bregman Algorithm. The iterative technique of Bregman was first introduced and studied in the field of image processing by Osher et al. Osher et al. proposed the iterative Bregman algorithm as an effective algorithm for solving optimization problems in [18]. Their main idea was to first transform a constraint optimization problem into a constraint-free problem by using the Bregman distance. This problem-solving algorithm is as follows:\nminu z u +H u, f , 22\nStep 0: k = 0 Let u0 \u2208\u211dn, \u03b5 > 0 be a precision. Step 1: we use the minimization approach to find a solution u1 to the following problem using a penalty coefficient r0 and a precision \u03b4 > 0.\narg min u\u2208\u211dn\n1/2 Im \u2212 u 22 + r0 max 0,\u03a0K u + 1/2 u \u2212 u0 2 2 ,\nStep 2: the solution obtained is u1 r0 = u1. If u1 \u2212 u0 22 < \u03b5 and if r0h u1 r0 < \u03b4, then u1 is an excellent approximation of the optimal solution, and the calculations stop at iteration k + 1 Otherwise, we use r1 > r0 as a penalty coefficient. We put r0 = r1, u0 = u1, and k = k + 1 and return to step 1.\nAlgorithm 1: [11, 12] Algorithm of proximal penalty.\nsuch that z X\u27f6\u211d and H X\u27f6\u211d are nonnegative convex functions of u \u2208 X, and H u, f is a smooth nonnegative convex function in relation to u for a given f , and X is a closed convex set.\nThe Bregman iterative algorithm is defined as follows by Osher et al. in [18].\n3.3. The Convergence Theorem. In [18], the variant of Bregman was presented for TV-based image rendering. Other features of this iterative Bregman scheme, as well as the convergence analysis, have been proven in detail in [18\u201320]. u1 = minu z u +H u is the first iteration of this method. The residual term must be minimal to solve the initial problem; once the residual term converges, the Bregman iterative algorithm continues. Because of its excellent convergence features, the Bregman iterative algorithm has been applied to a variety of problems, including badly posed problems and image dissection. The following are some of these qualities: with noisy data, we can achieve convergence to the original image we are seeking to recover, as well as convergence in terms of Bregman distance to the original image and a monotonous decline in the residual term. We have z u = u BV where \u2207u 1 and H u = 1/2 u \u2212 f 2 2 learned a lot about image redaction during our research. The technique generates a series that reduces H in a monotonous manner.\nProposition 1. [19] There exists a monotonous decrease H\nH uk+1 \u2264H uk+1 +Dpkz u k+1, uk \u2264H uk 23\nProposition 2. [19] The remaining residual terms H uk converge to the smallest value of H. If H X \u27f6\u211d and z u <\u221e are minimized by u, then\nH uk \u2264H u + z u k\n24\n3.4. The Split Bregman Algorithm. Goldstein and Osher first proposed the split Bregman algorithm in [21] to handle more general form optimization problems:\nmin u\u2208X H u + \u03a6 u 1 , 25\nwhere X is a closed convex set and \u03a6 X \u27f6\u211d and H X \u27f6\u211d are the convex functions. This problem is the same\nas the stress minimization problem as follows:\nmin u\u2208X,d\u2208\u211d H u + d 1 , such that d =\u03a6 u 26\nGoldstein and Osher introduced the split Bregman algorithm, which was written as follows:\nThe split Bregman algorithm is used to solve some of the most common form optimization problems:\nmin u\u2208X z u + 1 2 u \u2212 f 22 27\nAnisotropic and isotropic TV denoising problems are solved using the split Bregman method.\n3.4.1.

If \u03bb, \u03bc > 0 and c, x0 \u2208\u211dm as a result, the iteration scheme\nxk+1 = I \u2212 prox\u03bc/\u03bb 1 x k + c , k = 0, 1,\u22ef 44\nconverges towards its limit in a finite number of steps, for i = 1, 2,\u22ef,m,\nlim k\u27f6\u221e xk i =\n\u03bc sign ci \u03bb , ci \u2260 0,\nI \u2212 prox\u03bc/\u03bb x 0 i , ci = 0,\n45\nProof. In the case m = 1, this is the result. The evidence is divided into three categories: c > 0, c < 0, and c = 0.\nIn the case where c > 0, we have\n\u03bc \u03bb = I \u2212 prox\u03bc/\u03bb\n\u03bc \u03bb + c 46\nTo put it another way, the number \u03bc/\u03bb represents a fixed point in the iterative system. If x0 + c > \u03bc/\u03bb is true, then x1 = \u03bc/\u03bb for all k \u2265 1. In other words, one iteration\nCase c < 0 is comparable to that of case c > 0. The iterative pattern, in particular, converges in a finite number of steps to the limit \u2212\u03bc/\u03bb.\nFinally, we will look at example c = 0. The iterative pattern becomes xk+1 = I \u2212 prox\u03bc/\u03bb xk in this example.\nFor every k \u2265 1, we can see that xk = \u03bc/\u03bb if x0 \u2265 \u03bc/\u03bb; x0 \u2264 \u2212\u03bc/\u03bb if x0 = \u03bc/\u03bb; xk = x0 if x0 \u2264 \u03bc/\u03bb. As a result, the iteration to an end in a single step.\nThe convergence of the split Bregman anisotropic TV denoising algorithm was proved in [22]. As can be seen, we must solve a linear system according to the GoldsteinOsher split Bregman denoising.\nThe split Bregman denoising method is reduced to the Jia-Zhao denoising algorithm [23] as a result of this adjustment, which can be called the FP2O-ATV algorithm for k = 0.\nIn addition, both the Goldstein-Osher split Bregman algorithm and the Jia-Zhao denoising method make substantial use of the Bregman distance features and show signs of convergence.\nIn particular, the parameter \u03bb that guarantees convergence of the Jia-Zhao denoising algorithm must be less than 1/8, whereas for the algorithm FP2O-ATV to converge, it is relaxed to a number less than 1/4 sin\u22122 N\u22121 \u03c0/2N , which is somewhat higher than 1/4.\n3.5.2. Isotropic TV Denoising Algorithm. The following relationship is defined based on the various algorithms of the\nProof. We will look at the scenario where c = 0. In this situation, the equation is reduced to xk+1 = I \u2212 prox\u03bc/\u03bb 2 x k . If x0 2 \u2265 \u03bc/\u03bb, we have xk = \u03bcx0/\u03bb x0 2 for all k \u2265 1 and xk = x0 for all k \u2265 0 if x0 2 < \u03bc/\u03bb, as a result\nlim k\u27f6\u221e xk = x0 \u2212max x0 2 \u2212 \u03bc \u03bb , 0\nx0 x0 2 51\nIn the case of c \u2260 0, we have x\u221e = I \u2212 prox\u03bc/\u03bb 2 x\u221e + c , i.e., c = prox\u03bc/\u03bb 2 x\n\u221e + c , where x\u221e is the limit of the Picard iterations. If \u03a8 = \u03bc/\u03bb 2 is a convex function on \u211dd with x \u2208\u211dd then,\nc \u2208 \u2202\u03bc/\u03bb 2 x \u21d4 x = prox\u03bc/\u03bb 2 x + c ; 52\nand by Example 3 in the proximal operator, resulting in x\u221e = \u03bcc/\u03bb c 2\nThe convergence of the split Bregman isotropic TV denoising algorithm has been proved in [22, 24]. The linear system\nI + \u03bbBtB xk+1 = x \u2212 \u03bbBt bk \u2212 dk 53\nmust be resolved at each iteration of the split Bregman isotropic TV denoising algorithm, just as it must be resolved at each iteration of the split Bregman anisotropic TV denoising method. To reach an acceptable approximation of xk+1 [21], another Gauss-Seidel iteration step was used. The examination of the convergence of the resulting iterative scheme does not apply if the linear problem is solved using Gauss-Seidel iteration steps.\n4. An Overview of Relevant Recent Works and Methods in Image Processing\nThis work is an introduction to image restoration, which has an interesting ill-posed problem. It is important to improve the quality of the images. As noise damages images and reduces the accuracy and performance of processing tasks, there are many modern ways to remove noise. In this section, we will mention the relevant modern methods based on the ROF model to remove Gaussian noise. Below are some recommended works.\n4.1. Rudin-Osher-Fatemi Model. A denoising model based on the first-order total variation was proposed by Rudin et al. The ROFmodel is the popular name of the model. The ROFmodel does a great work of removing Gaussian noise, but it does not preserve image structures well. Otherwise, it creates artifacts.\nLet u0 x , u x , and v x \u2208\u211d be an original image, a restored image, and a noisy image, respectively, where x i, j \u2208\u03a9 \u2282\u211d2 is a pixel location, \u03a9 = 1,\u22ef,m \u00d7 1,\u22ef, n is an image domain, and m and n are the number of pixels by the image height and the image width. Rudin\nA parameter for regularization is \u03bb. Data fidelity is the first term, while smoothness measured by total variance is the second term. The ROF model is used for solving the denoising problem based on total variation regularization (TV).\n4.2. Method of Overlapping Group Sparsity and SecondOrder Total Variation Regularization. In [25], we propose an image denoising method named OGS-SOTV by combining\n(a) Overlapping group sparsity total variation regularization OGS-TV\nu\u2217 = arg min u\u2208\u03a9\n\u03bb 2 u \u2212 v 22 + \u03c6 \u2207u , 55\nwhere \u03c6 is an overlapping group sparsity functional with a group size of K and it is defined in [25] as\n\u03c6 u = \u3020 K2\ni,j=1 uij,K 2 56\n(b) The second-order total variation regularization SOTV or TV2\nTable 5: Results for image flower the anisotropic TV denoising algorithm.\nSigma SNR_TV_AS Number of iterations\nRelative error\nTime (s)\n0.08 10.0884 51 0.210941 73.156270\n0.15 7.1100 47 0.393911 57.259335\n0.25 3.6790 46 0.651452 78.888763\n0.35 1.1272 68 0.905142 73.037620\n0.501 -1.4576 182 1.24135 166.640882\nu\u2217 = arg min u\u2208\u03a9\n\u03bb 2 u \u2212 v 22 + \u2207 2u 2 2 57\nA combined model with \u03b41 > 0 and \u03b42 > 0 can be considered as follows:\nu\u2217 = arg min u\u2208\u03a9\n\u03bb 2 u \u2212 v 22 + \u03b41\u03c6 \u2207u + \u03b42 \u2207 2u 2 2 58\nAssume \u03b42 = \u03b3 \u03b41 and \u03bb = 2/\u03b41. So, we obtain the adaptive denoising model based on OGS-TV and SO-TV which are defined as follows:\nu\u2217 = arg min u\u2208\u03a9\n\u03bb 2 u \u2212 v 22 + \u03c6 \u2207u + \u03b3 \u2207 2u 2 2 , 59\nwhere \u03b3 is a balancing parameter of the noise removal term and artifact elimination term and \u03bb is a regularization parameter. The numerical solution is obtained with ADMM (alternative direction method of multipliers) or the split Bregman method.\n4.2.1. Purpose and Results of the Method. The purpose and results of the method are as follows:\n(i) performance of noise removal of OGS-TV\n(ii) performance of artifacts removed from TV-OS\n(iii) regularization estimation parameter is also proposed to implement the method automatically\n(iv) OGS-SOTV can remove noise effectively as well as eliminate artifacts\n(v) the OGS-TV, TV-OS, and OGS-SOTV removed noise and artifacts better than the ROF model.\n4.3. Medical Image Denoising Methods. In [26], we consider the denoising problem with medical images produced by Xray/CT imaging techniques. The images are corrupted by Poisson noise. Since the Poisson noise is dependent on the signal, we cannot control the intensity of the noise, so we use Gaussian noise.\nWe proposed a medical image denoising method, by combining\n(i) the total variation in the regularization of TV\n(ii) the Anscombe transformation\n4.3.1. Implementation Method\n(1) Based on the ROF model, Le et al. proposed the Poisson denoising problem; the model is well known as the modified ROF model (mROF)\nu\u2217 = arg min u\u2208\u03a9\n\u03bb 2 u \u2212 v ln u 22 + \u03b2 \u2207u 2 2 , 60\nwhere \u03b2 = 1/\u03bbu is a regularization parameter; it depends on the restored image of every iteration step. This matter reduces the accuracy and performance of the evaluation process.\n(2) Anscombe transform is a mathematics tool for converting a Poisson data \u03d5 to standard Gaussian data v, it has the following form: v = 2 \u03d5 + 3/8\n(3) Instead of solving the mROF problem, we can solve the ROF problem by obtaining a solution u\u2217\n(4) Apply the inverse Anscombe transform u\u2217 to acquire the final denoised image up = u\u2217/2 2 \u2212 3/8\n4.3.2. Purpose and Results. The purpose and results of the method are as follows:\n(i) the Anscombe transform is used to convert Gaussian noise in medical images into Poisson noise\n(ii) apply the ROF model that is based on TV to remove Gaussian noise\n(iii) the proposed method also gives a better denoising result than ROF or mROF by both visual result and restoration quality assessment metrics such as PSNR and SSIM\n4.4. Adaptive Method for Image Restoration Based on TV1 and TV2. In [27], we propose an adaptive method for image restoration based on a combination of\n(i) the first-order total variation regularization (TV1) also known as the ROF model\n(ii) the second-order total variation regularization SOTV or TV2 with\nu\u2217 = arg min u\u2208\u03a9\n\u03bb 2 u \u2212 v 22 + \u2207 2u 2 2 61\nA combined model with \u03b1 > 0 and \u03b2 > 0 can be considered as follows:\nu\u2217 = arg min u\u2208\u03a9\n\u03bb 2 u \u2212 v 22 + \u03b1 \u2207u 2 2 + \u03b2 \u2207 2u 2 2 62\nThe model is well known as the TV-bounded Hessian model (TV-BH).\nSuppose \u03b1 = \u03b2/k and \u03bb = k/\u03b2,k > 0. So, we obtain the adaptive image restoration model based on TV1 and TV2 as follows:\nu\u2217 = arg min u\u2208\u03a9 \u03bb v 2 u \u2212 v 22 + \u2207u 2 2 + k \u2207 2u 2 2 , 63\nwhere k is a balancing parameter between the (TV1) and (TV2) and \u03bb is a regularization parameter. We choose the regularization parameter \u03bb as based on the inverse gradient:\n\u03bb v = \u03bc\n1 + \u03c4 max \u03c1 G\u03c1\u2217\u2207v 2 2\n, 64\nwhere G\u03c1 is a 2D Gaussian kernel. The numerical solution is obtained with ADMM (alternative direction method of multipliers) or the split Bregman.\n4.4.1. Purpose and Results. The purpose and results of the method are as follows:\n(i) uses the advantages of noise removal and edge preservation of the ROF model that is based on TV1\n(ii) artifacts elimination of the second-order total variation TV2\n(iii) adaptive multiscale parameter estimation. If k > 1, artifacts are eliminated; if 0 < k < 1 remove noise;\nand if k = 1 to balance the performance of noise removal and artifact elimination\n(iv) experimental results indicate that the proposed method obtains better restorations in terms of visual quality as well as quantitatively by PSNR and SSIM\n5. Numerical Results\nWe use several images; the introduced additive noise is Gaussian, and we attempt to recover the original image to test the split Bregman methods in the problem of anisotropic and isotropic TV denoising. Let X be the matrices that depict an image of size m \u00d7 n. We then used\nMATLAB f = imnoise X,\u2032gaussian\u2032, sigma command to define our noise image f , where sigma is a version of the Gaussian noise level.\nClarification with the sources of the image used in Figure 1, I photographed my daughter Iline, with my mobile phone, and then I used MATLAB for converted\nthe color image to grayscale Y = imread \u2032Iline png\u2032 ; X = rgb2gray Y ; then conduct studies on the image Iline.\nWe used the values \u03bc = 0 1 and \u03bb = 0 2 and the tolerance Tol = 10\u22125 in our studies.\nThe results of the anisotropic and isotropic TV denoising algorithms for various images are shown in Tables 1 and 2. The u \u2212 X 22 is used to calculate relative errors.\nTables 3 and 4 show the performance metrics for the anisotropic and isotropic TV denoising algorithms, with sigma = 0 08.\nTables 5 and 6 prove the SNR for the anisotropic and isotropic TV denoising algorithms for a single \u201cflower\u201d image, as well as different sigma values.\nTable 7 shows the SNR values for the \u201cflower\u201d image that has been detached using the prox-penality, anisotropic TV denoising, and isotropic TV denoising algorithms.\n5.1. Comments on Experimental Results\n(i) As seen in Tables 1 and 2, isotropic TV denoising is faster and more accurate than the anisotropic version of the denoising method. In our experiments, we discovered that the sequence of residues for the image \u201cIline\u201d converged monotonously to a\nlower value than the original noisy image. However, due to the large size of this image, this takes a long time. The errors in the cameraman and university images increased monotonously and converged to a relative error point higher than the initial noisy image\u2019s relative error. This can be seen in the images and visuals that have been presented\n(ii) In Tables 3 and 4, we evaluate the quality of images restored by the image restoration models using square error (MSE), signal noise rate (SNR), peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR), image quality index (IQI), normalized cross-correlation (NK), average difference (AD), structural content (SC), maximum difference (MD), and normalized absolute error (NAE)\n(iii) For the \u201cflower\u201d image of the isotropic and anisotropic TV denoising algorithms and the same segregation value of 0.08, Tables 5 and 6 illustrate the varied SNR results, number of iterations, relative error, and time\n(iv) The relative error of split Bregman, an iterative technique with anisotropic and isotropic filters,\ndoes not necessarily converge monotonously, as we have shown\n(v) The quality of images produced with the prox method, on the other hand, remains constant, like the prox Lagrange value increases, maintaining the texture\u2019s performance after release\n(vi) Figures 1\u20133 illustrate the outcomes of restoration methods such as the TV anisotropic and TV isotropic images: cameraman, university, Iline, and for sigma equal to 0.08\n(vii) The results of errors applied to the TV anisotropic and TV isotropic renderings of the images are: cameraman, university, Iline, for a value of sigma equal to 0 08 are shown in Figures 4\u20136\n(viii) Figures 7 and 8 illustrate the original image and noisy image of the flower for sigma equal to 0.08 and 0.501\n(ix) Figures 9 and 10 also show that the restoration algorithms, such as the TV anisotropic and TV isotropic denoising, are not reliable and have problems during the restoration processing. In other words, they diverge as white noise invariance (sigma) increases. However, this is not the case when using the proximal algorithms. The latter appears to be very old and reliable. It provides a high sigma variance for the deforested image in Table 7\n(x) The SNR of the prox algorithm-restored images is nearly constant\n6. Conclusions\nIn this paper, we have compared the proximal penalty algorithms to solve a class of nondifferentiable optimization problems with the anisotropic TV and isotropic TV denoising algorithms for solving optimization problems. Based on the comparison of the restoration results from different related models, we can confirm that the prox algorithm suitable for image restoration produces the best high-quality results (clear, not smooth, and textures are kept), and the convergence method is guaranteed regardless of the SNR values if we compare it with other methods. Based on previous findings, we can conclude that the anisotropic TV and isotropic TV denoising algorithms work in a direct correlation relationship. In other words, regardless of how little the sigma value is, we get better and more old image quality results. The approach converges monotonously towards equal tolerance 10-5 despite the vast size of the image; it takes a long time to compute them, and the isotropic TV denoising algorithms are faster than the anisotropic TV denoising algorithms. In our tests, we discovered that the restored image is sharper and more accurate. The prox algorithm also gives better denoising results than TV that is anisotropic or isotropic, both in terms of the visual results and the restoration quality assessment metrics such as PSNR and SNR.\nIn our next studies, we would like to combine anisotropic and isotropic TV for image denoising to program the method in MATLAB, and we compared denoising methods.\nData Availability\nNo data were used to support this study.\nConflicts of Interest\nThe authors declare that they have no conflicts of interest.\nReferences\n[1] M.
