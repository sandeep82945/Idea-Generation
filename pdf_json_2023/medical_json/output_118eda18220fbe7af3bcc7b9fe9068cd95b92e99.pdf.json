    "abstractText": "Background Osteoarthritis (OA) is the most common degenerative disease in joints among elderly patients. Senescence is deeply involved in the pathogenesis of osteoarthritis. Metformin is widely used as the first-line drug for Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and has great potential for the treatment of other aging-related disorders, including OA. However, the role of metformin in OA is not fully elucidated. Therefore, our aim here was to investigate the effects of metformin on human chondrocytes. Methods After metformin treatment, expression level of microRNA-34a and SIRT1 in chondrocyte were detected with quantitative real-time PCR and immunofluorescence staining. Then, microRNA-34a mimic and small interfering RNA (siRNA) against SIRT1 (siRNA-SIRT1) were transfected into chondrocyte. Senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-gal) staining was performed to assess chondrocyte senescence. Chondrocyte viability was illustrated with MTT and colony formation assays. Western blot was conducted to detect the expression of P16, IL-6, matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), Collagen type II (COL2A1) and Aggrecan (ACAN). Results We found that metformin treatment (1 mM) inhibited microRNA-34a while promoted SIRT1 expression in OA chondrocytes. Both miR-34a mimics and siRNA against SIRT1 inhibited SIRT1 expression in chondrocytes. SA-\u03b2gal staining assay confirmed that metformin reduced SA-\u03b2-gal-positive rate of chondrocytes, while transfection with miR-34a mimics or siRNA-SIRT1 reversed it. MTT assay and colony formation assay showed that metformin accelerated chondrocyte proliferation, while miR-34a mimics or siRNA-SIRT1 weakened this effect. Furthermore, results from western blot demonstrated that metformin suppressed expression of senescence-associated protein P16, proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and catabolic gene MMP-13 while elevated expression of anabolic proteins such as Collagen type II and Aggrecan, which could be attenuated by transfection with miR-34a mimics. Conclusion Overall, our data suggest that metformin regulates chondrocyte senescence and proliferation through microRNA-34a/SIRT1 pathway, indicating it could be a novel strategy for OA treatment.",

Then, microRNA-34a mimic and small interfering RNA (siRNA) against SIRT1 (siRNA-SIRT1) were transfected into chondrocyte. Senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-gal) staining was performed to assess chondrocyte senescence. Chondrocyte viability was illustrated with MTT and colony formation assays. Western blot was conducted to detect the expression of P16, IL-6, matrix metalloproteinase-13 (MMP-13), Collagen type II (COL2A1) and Aggrecan (ACAN).\nResults We found that metformin treatment (1 mM) inhibited microRNA-34a while promoted SIRT1 expression in OA chondrocytes. Both miR-34a mimics and siRNA against SIRT1 inhibited SIRT1 expression in chondrocytes. SA-\u03b2gal staining assay confirmed that metformin reduced SA-\u03b2-gal-positive rate of chondrocytes, while transfection with miR-34a mimics or siRNA-SIRT1 reversed it. MTT assay and colony formation assay showed that metformin accelerated chondrocyte proliferation, while miR-34a mimics or siRNA-SIRT1 weakened this effect. Furthermore, results from western blot demonstrated that metformin suppressed expression of senescence-associated protein P16, proinflammatory cytokine IL-6 and catabolic gene MMP-13 while elevated expression of anabolic proteins such as Collagen type II and Aggrecan, which could be attenuated by transfection with miR-34a mimics.\nConclusion Overall, our data suggest that metformin regulates chondrocyte senescence and proliferation through microRNA-34a/SIRT1 pathway, indicating it could be a novel strategy for OA treatment.\nKeywords Metformin, MicroRNA-34a, SIRT1, Senescence, Proliferation, Osteoarthritis\n\u2020Shiju Yan and Wenjing Dong have contributed equally to this work\n*Correspondence: Feng Lin lyf1011@aliyun.com Full list of author information is available at the end of the article"

            "text": "Osteoarthritis (OA) is a prevalent age-related joint disorder characterized by progressive cartilage destruction, synovitis, subchondral bone remodeling and osteophyte formation [1]. OA causes pain and joint dysfunctions in the affected patients, leading to massive burden on social health care system. Various factors, including age, obesity, trauma history, abnormal mechanical stimulation, microRNAs and genetic predisposition, are closely related with both onset and progression of OA [2, 3]. However, there are no effective disease-modifying treatments that could reverse or delay OA development due to specific mechanisms leading to OA have not been fully elucidated. And more often, surgical treatments are essential for most patients with late-stage OA to improve life quality.\nAt present, etiology and pathogenesis of OA are complex and still remain not completely understood. Chondrocyte, the only cell type present in articular cartilage, plays a vital role in maintaining the dynamic homeostasis of anabolism and catabolism of the cartilage extracellular matrix (ECM) [4]. It is well accepted that chondrocyte senescence has been noted as a major event contributing to age-related changes in cartilage homeostasis, integrity and physiological function [5]. However, the exact mechanism linking senescence with OA pathogenesis remains to be further investigated and a better understanding of mechanisms of senescence underlying OA could provide new therapeutic targets for OA prevention and treatment.\nMetformin has been widely used as the first-line medication for Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) by activating adenosine monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK) [6], which lay a solid foundation for metformin to regulate metabolic and cellular processes, such as senescence, inflammation, oxidative stress and apoptosis [7, 8]. Evidence suggests that metformin has high safety profile and could be promising for a number of agerelated diseases, such as degenerative musculoskeletal diseases, cardiovascular diseases and neurodegenerative diseases [9]. Recent study has been discussing the potential use of metformin in OA management. Metformin attenuates cartilage degradation and modulates painrelated behavior in a destabilization of the medial meniscus (DMM) model of OA in mice [10]. Latest research shows that metformin treatment decreases cartilage degradation, inhibits cartilage matrix catabolism and enhances cartilage matrix anabolism in both the early and late stages of OA [11]. Thus, metformin could be prospective in OA treatment.\nMicroRNAs are a family of endogenous non-coding RNAs with 18 ~ 24 nucleotides in length [12]. MicroRNAs could regulate gene expression at post-translational\nlevel by binding to the 3\u2032-untranslated region (3\u2032-UTR) of target mRNAs [13]. Numerous studies have shown that microRNAs are involved with various cellular processes, such as senescence, cell proliferation, apoptosis and migration [3, 12, 14]. MicroRNA-34a (miR-34a) has been reported as a potential indicator of senescence, since its expression is increased in several aging tissue and cells, including chondrocytes [15\u201317]. Moreover, microRNA34a is a target gene of metformin, which regulates multiple biological processes by regulating the expression of microRNA-34a [18, 19]. Therefore, exploring the roles of microRNAs and their potential target genes is critical for understanding the molecular mechanisms of OA pathogenesis.\nSirtuins (silent information regulator proteins) are a family of nicotinamide dinucleotide (NAD+)-dependent deacylases and highly conserved from bacteria to humans, which control a variety of cellular processes, including DNA repair, cell cycle, mitochondria homeostasis and cellular senescence [20, 21]. SIRT1 is the best studied sirtuins in bone and cartilage and is critical in maintaining cartilage health by promoting chondrocyte survival and ECM homeostasis [22]. Furthermore, evidence suggests that SIRT1 is one of the direct targets of microRNA-34a and microRNA-34a promotes chondrocyte apoptosis by regulating SIRT1, contributing to OA pathogenesis [17, 23]. Thus, this study is aimed to explore the effects of metformin in OA, specifically on chondrocyte senescence and proliferation, and investigate the molecular mechanisms of it by focusing on its target gene microRNA-34a and the downstream microRNA-34a/ SIRT1 signaling pathway."

Compared with NC group (Fig.\u00a03a), metformin treatment significantly decreased percentage of SA-\u03b2gal-positive OA chondrocytes in Metformin group (Fig.\u00a0 3b).

In this present study, the connection between metformin and microRNA-34a in OA was investigated and quantitative RTPCR results showed that metformin treatment inhibited expression level of microRNA-34a in OA chondrocytes. However, conflicting results related with metformin and microRNA-34a have been reported. Several studies reported metformin could elevate microRNA-34a expression [27, 28], while more researchers demonstrated metformin could inhibit microRNA-34a expression [18, 19, 29], indicating that the interplay between metformin and microRNA-34a is more complicated than we thought and more efforts are needed to investigate the mechanisms of metformin on microRNA-34a. On the other hand, we found metformin incubation elevated SIRT1 expression in OA chondrocytes, which was also demonstrated by immunofluorescence staining.\nIt is known that microRNAs tend to exert their roles by regulating translation or stability of mRNAs of downstream target gene [13]. Specifically, microRNA-34a has been reported to directly target SIRT1 [30], which coincided with what we observed in this study that transfection of microRNA -34a mimic could inhibit SIRT1 expression in chondrocytes. Moreover, the siRNA we ordered could effectively inhibit SIRT1 expression, which is necessary for the following experiments. Thus, we hypothesized microRNA-34a and its well-studied target, the longevity-associated protein SIRT1, were involved in the biological function of metformin in OA.\nSince aging is crucial to OA, any drug targeting cell senescence and associated chronic low-grade inflammation and metabolic disorder could be utilized to slow down OA progression. Metformin is thought to be an \u201canti-aging\u201d drug, based on in\u00a0 vitro and animal experiments and numerous retrospective analyses on beneficial outcomes for type 2 diabetics and is being tested in several clinical trials evaluating the impact of metformin on aging [31\u201333]. Previous studies document microRNA34a as an important regulator of age-dependent tissue changes and a cell senescence inducer in many diseases [34]. Meanwhile, SIRT1 has been reported to counteract multiple aging-associated diseases on account of its\ncapacity to modulate a variety of cellular processes such as DNA repair, apoptosis, mitochondrial biogenesis and cell stress responses [35, 36]. Therefore, we assume that metformin ameliorates OA by regulating chondrocytes senescence through microRNA-34a/SIRT1 pathway. Firstly, we examined the effect of metformin on senescence in OA chondrocytes and results from SA-\u03b2galactosidase staining suggest that metformin treatment attenuated chondrocytes senescence and overexpression of microRNA-34a or silencing SIRT1 by siRNA could reverse this effect. At the same time, we also detected that overexpression of microRNA-34a or silencing SIRT1 could counteract the stimulative effect of metformin on chondrocyte proliferation and cell clone formation. All these suggest metformin provided a protective effect to chondrocytes, while microRNA-34a/SIRT1 pathway is deeply involved.\nCellular senescence is a permanent state of cell cycle arrest and plays a significant role in the pathology of OA as OA chondrocytes shows elevated senescence-associated- \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-Gal) activity and accumulation of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors P16, P21 [37]. Senescent chondrocytes exhibit inhibited proliferation capacity and loss of original phenotype, leading\nto imbalance of ECM metabolism [38]. In addition, OA chondrocytes undergo chronic and dynamic transformations into senescence-associated secretory phenotypes (SASP), characterized by increased secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and matrix metalloproteinases (MMP), such as MMP-13 [39]. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms of metformin on chondrocytes senescence. Western blot results demonstrated that metformin inhibited expression of P16, IL-6 and MMP-13 while elevated Collagen II and Aggrecan expression, indicating metformin ameliorated chondrocytes senescence through regulating P16 and attenuated OA by inhibiting SASP production and promoting extracellular matrix synthesis. Moreover, the restoration of microRNA-34a markedly counteracted this chondroprotective effect of metformin. Taken together, our study demonstrated that metformin inhibited chondrocyte senescence and promoted chondrocyte proliferation through microRNA-34a/SIRT1 pathway in osteoarthritis.\nIn summary, we suggest that metformin downregulated microRNA-34a and elevated SIRT1 in OA chondrocytes. Metformin ameliorated OA by inhibiting chondrocyte senescence and SASP secretion, as well as promoting\nchondrocyte proliferation and extracellular matrix synthesis via microRNA-34a/SIRT1 axis. These findings give us a new perspective of relationship between metformin and OA and could make metformin a novel choice for OA therapeutic strategy.\nAcknowledgements Not applicable\nAuthor contributions SY, WD and FL designed this study.
