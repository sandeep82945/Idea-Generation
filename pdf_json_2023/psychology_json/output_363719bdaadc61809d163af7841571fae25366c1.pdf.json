    "abstractText": "The self-assembly of two complementary precision oligomers leads to a collection of linear and cyclic oligomers in which di(oligomeric) macrocycles are favored at low concentration. In the macrocycles, the fi ve catalytic groups needed for the Copper(I)/TEMPO-catalyzed aerobic oxidation of alcohols are brought closely together as shown by molecular dynamics simulations and network analysis, resulting in high catalytic turnover frequencies even at high dilution (cover image). The self-assembly of the complementary oligomers and their catalytic activity are mathematically described, which provides guidelines to further improve self-assembling catalytic systems.",

Here, we show by molecular dynamics simulations and experiments that, by designing sequencedened oligomeric chains equipped with functional catalytic groups and complementary recognition units, it is possible to induce the dynamic self-assembly of supramolecular cyclic structures displaying unusually high catalytic efficiency at low concentrations. Importantly, we also show that the catalytic properties of such oligomers can be accurately predicted by a compact mathematical model, despite the multiplicity of their possible assembly congurations.\nAttempts to form catalytic sites by self-assembly of synthetic macromolecules have been reported using peptides,3\u20137 DNA scaffolds,8\u201314 single-chain polymeric nanoparticles (SCNPs),15\u201320 peptides,21 metal organic frameworks,22,23 supramolecular polymers,24 foldamers,25 and helical (supramolecular) polymers.26\u201329 Additionally, supramolecular and covalent macrocycles have been synthesized to create catalytic sites involving the concerted action of different functional groups,30\u201334 because cyclic congurations decrease the accessible conformational space and thereby increase the probability to bring catalyticallyactive groups in spatially-close positions.\nIn our approach, we combine these ideas by designing two precision oligomers (Oa and Ob1 in Fig. 1D) that can selfassemble in a variety of congurations, including di(oligomeric) macrocycles (Fig. 1E).

In support of this hypothesis, recent ndings have shown the effectiveness of dinuclear copper complexes in the TEMPO-catalyzed aerobic oxidation of alcohols.40,41 As shown in ESI\u2020 (Section 12), our results also indicate that the catalytic cycle involves two Cu(I) atoms, two pyridyltriazole bidentate copper ligands (P) and two imidazole auxiliary copper ligands (I), in addition to the TEMPO radical (M).\nThese ve needed functional groups were precisely distributed between two strands Oa and Ob, each strand having\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Additionally, the two strands were equipped with complementary hydrogenbinding recognition units at their ends to favor their assembly into a variety of congurations, including supramolecular di(oligomeric) cycles, while avoiding the formation of homooligomeric supramolecular structures (Fig. 1B\u2013E).\nThe functional groups are attached as side chains to an oligo(urethane triazole) backbone (Fig. 1B); the precise sequence of these complementary oligomers is displayed in Fig. 1D. The general synthetic procedure (Scheme 1) was demonstrated before to provide access to sequence-dened stereocontrolled oligomers.42 Here, we considerably extended the range of available side chains to include complementary nucleobase analogs (cytosine C, guanine G, thymine T and 2,6-diamidopyridine D) acting as recognition units through G/C and D/T pairing (Fig. 1C). The catalytic groups comprise two pyridyltriazole (P)\u2013copper complexes, two imidazole co-ligands (I and I\u2032 having different spacer lengths for optimal accessibility), and one TEMPO radical (M). Additionally, hexyl side chains (C6) were added at both ends of the chains to favor solubility in the acetonitrile : dimethylsulfoxide 95 : 5 v/v solvent system used for the experiments and possibly contribute to stabilization of the self-assembled structures.

When selfassembled in a di(oligomeric) cycle in the presence of Cu(I), the two strands should provide together the ve groups needed for catalysis (Fig. 1A). To demonstrate the completeness of this self-assembled active site, two other Ob strands were also synthesized, both of which can only form an incomplete catalytic site in combination with Oa: a C6CII DC6 \u00f0Ob2\u00de sequence that lacks a P group, and a C6CIPDC6\u00f0Ob3\u00de sequence that lacks a I group (Fig. 1D). Due to the removal of one unit in one strand of each of these two systems, the Ob2 and Ob3 chains are one unit shorter than the Ob1 chain of the complete system. The libraries of self-assembled congurations that form from these three systems are shown in Fig. 1E.\nMolecular dynamics (MD) simulations of one Oa and one Ob1 chains placed in an effective solvent indicate the rapid assembly of the oligomers in a stable heteromolecular complex of ca. 1 nm radius of gyration (Fig. 2A; details in ESI Section 10\u2020).

Interestingly, the catalytic units are among the less buried residues and are accessible at the periphery of the globule (Fig. S164\u2020).\nNetwork theory applied to the collection of conformations generated over a 10 ms timescale indicates that interchain connectivity arises dominantly through interactions between complementary bases, whereas intrachain connectivity replicates the primary structure of the chains (Fig. 2B). Other parameters of the network such as betweenness and average shortest path length provide further support to the formation of a globule stabilized by interactions between nucleobases (Fig. S166\u2020). A modular representation of the network shows that the catalytic modules (M, I\u2032, I, P in Fig. 2C) are connected via the connectivity between the bases. Analysis of MD simulations indicates that the formation of this supramolecular complex is driven both by hydrogen bonding and p-stacking interactions (Fig. 2D).\nHeatmaps enumerating the frequency of hydrogen bonds (Fig. 2E) show that C/G and D/T pairings provide an important but not exclusive contribution to the persistence of the\n9286 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 9283\u20139292\nglobular assembly, with D/G pairing providing a signicant but less frequent mechanism of stabilization. Stacking interactions are far less specic, involving numerous residues including triazole groups from the backbone and aromatic catalytic units (I\u2032, I, P) (Fig. S163\u2020).\nHeatmaps of the enthalpy of binding per residue provide a detailed view on the stabilization per residue pair, globally showing the stabilization of the supramolecular complex by interchain interactions between the different bases. This indicates that when forming the complex, intermolecular interactions outperform the intramolecular interactions of each strand when alone. The same analysis was performed on the Oa/Ob2 system and provided similar results, with the same type of interactions stabilizing the formation of a globular complex (Fig. S165\u2020).\nThe catalytic systems were tested in the aerobic oxidation of benzyl alcohol (BnOH) into benzaldehyde (BzH), for different temperatures between 30 \u00b0C and 60 \u00b0C and at different molar concentrations of catalyst.

Indeed, the collection of poly(oligomers) of the incomplete systems (such as in Oa/Ob2 solutions) exhibits a very low TOF despite comprising all the groups needed for catalysis (Fig. 3C); in contrast, the library of poly(oligomers) of the complete Oa/Ob1 system exhibits a much higher TOF at low concentration (Fig. 3B). Additionally, a catalytic system made of all monomer units at the same concentration as in the complete Oa/Ob1 system was measured for reference (crosses in Fig. 3D); its performance rapidly decreases upon dilution, owing to the decrease of the probability of chance encounter of the catalytic groups. This is in marked contrast with the complete Oa/Ob1 catalytic system that resists dilution and intriguingly exhibits an optimum close to 1 mol% (Fig. 3B). Likewise, the system consisting of the Oa and Ob1 oligomers devoid of H-binding G, T, D and C units and of hydrophobic C6 units (the MP dimer and the II\n\u2032P trimer, pentagons in Fig. 3D), although very effective at high concentrations due to its limited steric crowding, rapidly decreases with concentration and becomes less efficient than the hydrogen-bonded system below 1 mol% of catalyst.\nThe complete Oa/Ob1 system is thus peculiar in its specic ability to maintain catalytic activity at low dilutions. Whereas higher catalytic activities can certainly be obtained for the other systems simply by introducing larger amounts of catalytic components (such as for the system made of separated monomer units or theMP/II\u2032P system, Fig. 3D), the complete system is unique in its preservation of catalytic efficiency when diluted. We ascribe this resistance to dilution to the formation of selfassembled catalytic di(oligomeric) cycles.\nThe oligomer chains dynamically bind in a variety of congurations (Fig. 1E), resulting in the coexistence of different species including free oligomeric strands, linear poly(oligomer) s of varying length and chain ends, and di(oligomeric) cycles. In the incomplete Oa/Ob2 and Oa/Ob3 systems, self-assembly congurations comprising at least three oligomers generally contain all groups needed for catalysis, whereas di(oligomeric) congurations do not; as shown in Fig. 3C, these self-assembly congurations only provide mediocre catalytic efficiency. The fully different behavior of the complete Oa/Ob1 system thus necessarily arises from di(oligomer) assemblies, which now comprise all needed catalytic groups. Since these di(oligomeric) assemblies tend to easily form self-assembled macrocycles as shown by molecular dynamics simulations, it follows that the high catalytic efficiency at low concentrations of the Oa/Ob1 system arises from the formation of di(oligomeric) cycles.\nDespite the virtually-innite number of species in each constitutional library, their composition and catalytic activity can be modeled in a compact form by a mathematical model comprising a small set of physically-meaningful parameters, common to all libraries, temperatures and concentrations (ESI Section 9\u2020). These parameters include two binding constants,\nChem. Sci., 2023, 14, 9283\u20139292 | 9287\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle . P\nub lis\nhe d\non 1\n6 A\nug us\nt 2 02\n3.

The concen-\ntration in each species can be computed numerically from this model, as well as their contribution to the turnover frequencies at each temperature and concentration (ESI Section 9\u2020). This compact mathematical model was simultaneously tted to all experimental catalytic turnover frequencies measured at different temperatures and concentrations, for the two Oa/Ob1 and Oa/Ob2 systems taken together, leading to a quantitative reproduction of the experimental data (lines in Fig. 3B and C); parameters are reported in Table S2 (ESI Section 9\u2020).\nThe possibility to represent at once with a compact mathematical model the catalytic properties of such complex selfassembling systems is an important outcome of this study. However, the model needs to be validated by an independent measurement of the concentration of each species in the solution (Fig. 1E), especially di(oligomeric) cycles which are of interest to us. These species are in constant dynamic equilibrium and cannot be isolated; furthermore, the oligomers they contain are involved in similar interactions in all species. Their concentrations are thus very difficult to measure by any available technique. However, each species possesses its own molecular mass and hydrodynamic volume. The diffusion coefficient of a proton attached to an oligomer included in a species of the constitutional libraries depends directly on the hydrodynamic volume of this species, which can be computed from its composition in each oligomer and from the hydrodynamic volume of the oligomers (ESI Section 9\u2020). Additionally, the diffusion coefficient averaged over all co-existing species only depends on the hydrodynamic radii and concentrations in solution of these species. Hence, measuring the average diffusion coefficient of the protons provides an elegant way to check in situ the compositions of the constitutional libraries predicted by our model.\nThe diffusion coefficient of the protons of the complete Oa/ Ob1 systemwas thusmeasured by DOSY NMR. A single diffusion band was seen at all concentrations by DOSY proton NMR performed in deuterated acetonitrile/DMSO 95 : 5 v/v at 300 K in the absence of copper (ESI Section 6\u2020), indicating that fast exchange of the oligomers between the different co-existing species occurs within the NMR timeframe. In these circumstances, the average diffusion coefficient can be computed from the concentration of each co-existing species by the Stokes\u2013 Einstein equation (ESI Section 9\u2020), with as input parameters K1, K2, DS c and the hydrodynamic radii of each isolated oligomer, which were measured by DOSY to be 0.50 \u00b1 0.02 and 0.57 \u00b1 0.02 nm for Oa and Ob1, respectively (Table S1, ESI Section 6\u2020).\nThe measured and predicted diffusion coefficients of the complete Oa/Ob1 system were then compared (Fig. 4), using as parameters for the prediction the t parameters obtained from the analysis of the catalytic data (Fig. 3). The experimental data agree very well with the predicted values assuming good solvent conditions (continuous line in Fig. 4).\nThis model was thus used to compute the distribution of Oa oligomers between the different species for the Oa/Ob systems, depending on temperature and concentration (Fig. 5 top row). Oligomers are essentially free at very low concentrations,\n9288 | Chem. Sci., 2023, 14, 9283\u20139292\nwhereas they dominantly belong to linear poly(oligomeric) chains above 1 mol% of catalyst. The decrease of the binding constants K1 and K2 with temperature explains why the average degree of poly(oligomerization) of the linear chains slightly decreases with temperature (inset in top row of Fig. 5); however,\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Di(oligomeric) cycles slightly dominate the constitutional libraries at intermediate concentrations and lower temperatures, but this dominance is progressively lost as temperature increases. The decreased amount of cycles as temperature increases essentially results from the increased free energy cost associated to the entropy penalty for cycle formation \u00f0DS c\u00de.\nThe contributions of each species to the total catalytic turnover frequency of the complete Oa/Ob1 system, which is the product between the amount of Oa in each species and the turnover frequency per Oa (ESI Section 9\u2020), are collected in the bottom row of Fig. 5. The contribution of supramolecular di(oligomeric) cycles to the total turnover frequency is the dominant factor that explains the high catalytic activity of the complete system, even when the supramolecular cycles do not dominate the composition (e.g., at 60 \u00b0C). At this higher temperature, the relative proportion of cycles decreases but their catalytic activity increases due to thermal activation, resulting in an overall dominance of the cycles in the catalytic performance.\nCycles are thus much better than linear chains to reach a high catalytic activity, despite both congurations having all required active groups. At the concentration maximizing di(oligomeric) cycles, the ratio between the contributions to the catalytic activity of cycles versus all linear chains is ca. 30 and 10, at 30 and 60 \u00b0C, respectively. This is due to the much higher probability for the catalytic groups to be in an active site when assembled in a supramolecular cycle, compared to when in linear chains. This demonstrates that, by assembling the complementary strands in a supramolecular cycle, and thereby maximizing the probability that the ve required groups meet in space, dramatic improvements of the catalytic efficiency by more than one order of magnitude can be obtained compared to linear congurations. In contrast, for the incomplete Oa/Ob2 system, supramolecular cycles cannot form complete catalytic sites and therefore do not contribute to the catalytic activity; consequently, this system only exhibits low activity associated to the low probability of formation of complete catalytic sites in linear poly(oligomeric) chains.\nIt is tempting to compare the efficiency of our supramolecular catalyst to other systems based on the same composition, in which the different catalytic groups are positioned differently in space.46 Depending on the sequence of units along chains45,47,48 and on their graing congurations when heterogeneized,47,49\u201351 catalysts based on M, I and P units have been shown to exhibit very different catalytic efficiencies, as judged from their initial TOF. Compared to systems graed on porous silica beads, the current supramolecular cycles are generally slightly inferior, probably because of a smaller accessibility of the substrates in the crowded globules of the cycles. In contrast, at 60 \u00b0C and below 1 mol%, the current supramolecular catalysts are better than any other homogeneous system we tested so far; this advantage is rapidly lost as concentration increases, because supramolecular cycles are disfavoured at higher concentrations while the probability of encounter is increased for other systems. However, our model can be used to predict directions for a larger range of conditions favouring the formation of the catalytically-\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nactive self-assembled di(oligomeric) cycles. For instance, increasing the chain end pairing constants by a factor of ca. 10 compared to their current geometric average value at 30 \u00b0Cwould result in a solution consisting almost exclusively of supramolecular cycles below 1 mol% catalyst. To favour cycles at higher concentrations, which would result in higher absolute catalytic rates, a supplementary stabilizationmechanismmust be given to cycles compared to linear chains. One way to achieve this is to reduce the entropy cost of cycle formation \u00f0DS c\u00de, which might be attained by increasing the rigidity of the oligomer backbones; however, this might be counter-productive with respect to the probability to have the catalytic groups meet in space. Another way would be to provide a supplementary enthalpy of stabilization specic to macrocycles, for example by using pairs of recognition units at each end of each oligomer, which would create a directionality in the pairing of ends and could thereby favour cycles over linear chains."

            "text": "Our study investigated the self-assembly of complementary oligomers into a dynamic library of poly(oligomeric) species, most of which contribute little to catalytic activity. In this dynamic library, di(oligomeric) cycles were demonstrated to be highly catalytically-active, provided the two chains together comprise all the needed elements for catalysis, as in the Oa/Ob1 system. When only one element is missing as in Oa/Ob2 and Oa/ Ob3, the activity drops very signicantly, despite all needed elements are present in the solution. The activity can be recovered by adding the missing unit as a free component in solution (Fig. S168\u2020). These results support the assumption35 that ve functional groups, including a dinuclear copper complex, are involved in the catalytic cycle.\nMolecular dynamics simulations demonstrate that these self-assembled cycles form globules in which different interactions contribute to stabilization, even though the base analogs at the ends of the strands provide a continuous stabilization mechanism and connectivity between the catalytic groups, as shown by network analysis. Measurement of hydrodynamic radius also provides experimental support for the formation of di(oligomeric) cycles.\nHence, the primary structure of the oligomers is important for the emergence of catalytic activity, because the presence or absence of the needed catalytic groups on the strands directly affects the efficiency of the di(oligomeric) cycles. However, it is likely that the sequence order is not a critical factor at this stage, considering the limited length of the investigated oligomers. Nevertheless, quaternary structures are crucial for the emergence of catalytic activity, which here arises dominantly from the self-assembly of the strands in di(oligomeric) cycles. Interestingly, the self-assembly of di(oligomeric) cycles happens in a relatively dilute range of concentrations, in which cycles totally outperform simple mixtures of catalytic groups or any combination of the catalytic groups in linear chains. This demonstrates that an efficient catalytic activity can be obtained at rather high dilutions in the presence of properly selfassembled structures.\nChem.

Indeed, the reproduction of catalytic activities and diffusion coefficients by a compact mathematical model is an important outcome of the present work, showing that the complexity of this system is still amenable to a deterministic description. Additionally, the interest of using network theory to interpret molecular dynamics simulations, and to support assumptions made in the mathematical model of the system, is another important outcome of this study."
