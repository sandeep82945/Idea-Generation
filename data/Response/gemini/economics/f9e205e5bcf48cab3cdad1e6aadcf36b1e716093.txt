1. **Investigate the role of social networks and peer influence on farmers' adaptation decisions.** The current model does not consider the influence of social networks on farmers' decision-making. Future research could explore how social networks and peer influence affect farmers' willingness to adopt adaptation measures.
2. **Examine the impact of different types of extreme events on farmers' adaptation decisions.** The current model only considers the occurrence of extreme weather events, but does not distinguish between different types of events. Future research could investigate how different types of extreme events, such as droughts, floods, and heat waves, affect farmers' adaptation decisions.
3. **Develop a more detailed representation of the agricultural production system.** The current model only considers a simplified representation of the agricultural production system. Future research could develop a more detailed representation of the agricultural production system, including factors such as crop yields, livestock production, and input costs.
4. **Incorporate the role of government policies and regulations on farmers' adaptation decisions.** The current model does not consider the role of government policies and regulations on farmers' adaptation decisions. Future research could incorporate the role of government policies and regulations, such as subsidies, taxes, and land-use regulations, on farmers' adaptation decisions.
5. **Explore the potential for using machine learning to improve the accuracy of the model.** The current model uses a rule-based approach to simulate farmers' decision-making. Future research could explore the potential for using machine learning to improve the accuracy of the model.
