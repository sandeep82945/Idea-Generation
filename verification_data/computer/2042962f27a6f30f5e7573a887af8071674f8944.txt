"In this paper, we propose a novel NPR framework called REPEATNPR that adapts a state-of-the-art encoder-decoder language model for fixing single-line Java bugs. To accurately capture the semantic relationship between the buggy statement and its context, we make the first attempt to leverage program dependence analysis to improve the NPR task by extracting slicing-based contextual information as repair ingredients from PDG. Additionally, we propose an intuitive but effective filter mechanism to eliminate the unaltered patches by taking advantage of the ensemble performance of different NPR models. Empirical results demonstrate that REPEATNPR outperforms the state-of-the-art approaches on five widely used benchmarks in terms of the exact match metric. Furthermore, we will design a better filter mechanism that can determine more incorrect patches (except the unaltered ones) without comparing them with the human-written ground truth."
