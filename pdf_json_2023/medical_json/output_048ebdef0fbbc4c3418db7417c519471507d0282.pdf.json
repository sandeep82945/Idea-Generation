We aim to address\nthis gap by undertaking research regarding the identification of deception\nin Asians in realistic environments. In this study, we develop a Chinese\nWerewolf Deception Database (C2W2D), which consists of 168 video clips\n(84 deception videos and 84 honest videos). A total of 1,738,760 frames of\nfacial data are recorded. Fifty-eight healthy undergraduates (24 men and 34\nwomen) and 26 drug addicts (26 men) participated in a werewolf game. The\ndevelopment of C2W2D is accomplished based on a \u201cwerewolf\u201d deception\ngame paradigm in which the participants spontaneously tell the truth or a\nlie. Two synced high-speed cameras are used to capture the game process.\nTo explore the differences between lying and truth-telling in the database,\ndescriptive statistics (e.g., duration and quantity) and hypothesis tests are\nconducted using action units (AUs) of facial expressions (e.g., t-test). The\nC2W2D contributes to a relatively sizable number of deceptive and honest\nsamples with high ecological validity. These samples can be used to study the\nindividual differences and the underlying mechanisms of lies and truth-telling\nbetween drug addicts and healthy people.\nKEYWORDS\ndeception database, facial expression, video, ecological validity, cross-culture, individual difference, emotion\n1. Introduction\nDeception is an intentional attempt to mislead others (DePaulo et al., 2003). The deceptive behaviors occur in the form of intended lies, fabrications, omissions, and misrepresentations. People lie to escape from a situation that seems unfavorable to them (Hartman et al., 2022). Some lies are detrimental and threaten social stability and national security (Wu et al., 2018). Misreading deception or wrongful assertions of deceit can lead to exclusion, loss of resources, embarrassment, or termination of existing\nFrontiers in Psychology 01 frontiersin.org\nrelationships (Carton et al., 1999; Belot et al., 2010). Although the need to accurately detect deception is essential, the observers only perform slightly better as compared with a random assertion, when deciding whether a person is lying, and the average accuracy is only 54% (Vrij et al., 2000; Bond and DePaulo, 2006).\nThe poor accuracy, to some degree, stems from the lack of reliable deception cues that are consistent across various situations (Levine, 2014). The studies have examined potential deceptive cues for detecting deception, including physiological cues [e.g., Polygraph (Iacono and Ben-Shakhar, 2019)], thermal imaging (Harper et al., 2019), electroencephalography (Kohan et al., 2020), functional magnetic resonance imaging (Yu et al., 2019), cognitive cues [e.g., cognitive load (Vrij et al., 2012)], memory confabulation (Dianiska et al., 2019)], and the behavioral cues (DePaulo et al., 2003; Hauch et al., 2015). However, the physiological and cognitive cues cannot be used in a contactless style, resulting in the inability to spot liars in public areas, such as airports or subway stations.\nThe research demonstrates that some behavioral cues, especially facial cues, may differentiate between lying and being truthful (Vrij et al., 2000; Shen et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2021). Darwin noted that some facial muscles are difficult to control especially when one feels strong emotions and they can show one\u2019s authentic feelings (Ekman, 2003). Porter and ten Brinke (2008) also reported that one inconsistent expression is leaked transiently at least once, while an unfelt emotional facial expression is fake or liars neutralize an emotion. In short, facial cues can be a potentially effective indicator of deception.\nRecently, researchers have shown increasing interest in automatically detecting deceptive behavior cues by applying machine learning and computer vision techniques (Meservy et al., 2005, 2008; Jensen et al., 2010; Michael et al., 2010; Wright et al., 2012; Borza et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2018; Shen et al., 2021). Studies have shown that some facial features can be important cues for detecting deception, including blink rate (Borza et al., 2018), facial movements (Chen et al., 2018), and facial expressions (Shen et al., 2021). These facial features are employed in distinguishing lies from the truth with relatively high accuracy. Nevertheless, most of the research has been conducted in the laboratory. A few studies in which real-life deception datasets are used have a small number of samples [real-life trial, refer to Shen et al. (2021)] that negatively affect the prediction rule in machine learning. Therefore, a more extensive dataset with high ecological validity is urgently needed for automatic deception detection.\nIn terms of ecological validity, the focus has primarily been on producing deception. Most deception research is conducted in laboratories that differ from natural conditions (Orne and Holland, 1968; Levine, 2018; Kihlstrom, 2021). The experimental instructions drastically limit the pragmatic flexibility in deceptive message production as compared with non-research deception (Levine, 2018). Therefore, most of the\nresearchers have concluded that the deception paradigms have a greater ecological validity under natural conditions than under controlled conditions (Marvin, 1968; Wright et al., 2012, 2013; Levine, 2018; Kihlstrom, 2021).\nResearchers have identified several potential threats to ecological validity. For example, Delgado-Herrera et al. (2021) reviewed the ecological validity of fMRI deception tasks and concluded that \u201cintention to lie\u201d was the component least frequently included in deception tasks, followed by \u201csocial interaction,\u201d while \u201cmonetary reward\u201d was the most frequent motivation. It may be indicative of the preference for setting monetary incentives for designing deception paradigms. However, tasks with high ecological validity that have used monetary incentives have been shown to recruit fewer brain areas than tasks, with low ecological validity [refer to DelgadoHerrera et al. (2021)]. In addition, the measures with proven discriminability of ecological validity are also difficult to generate (there is no way to test the ecological validity of deception). Although challenging, some related studies have identified several components of deception that have a high degree of ecological validity, such as monetary incentives, motivation, and fear of failure (Wright et al., 2012; Levine, 2018; Delgado-Herrera et al., 2021; Kihlstrom, 2021).\nDeceptive behaviors often occur in cross-cultural communications (Levine et al., 2016). In general, findings have revealed that the accuracy of individuals in cross-cultural deception detection is below chance (Taylor et al., 2017). The culture affects a deceiver\u2019s motivations, cognitive difficulty, arousal, and behavioral control. In addition, it also shapes the behavioral patterns relevant to deception (Burgoon et al., 2021). Therefore, cross-cultural deception has also received considerable attention in the deception community (Papantoniou et al., 2021). In particular, Perez-Rosas et al. (2014) revealed that cross-cultural differences are motivated by issues such as languages, beliefs, and moral values, which might influence how the deception is perpetrated and influence the detection of deception. However, most deception research has been undertaken in a \u201ccultural vacuum\u201d of North Americans and Western Europeans, with only a few studies in Asia. According to Levitan et al. (2015), it is problematic that there is a lack of research on deception in cultures other than Western cultures.\nIn addition, Castillo and Mallard (2012) suggested that low cross-cultural deception judgment accuracy may result from individuals being unfamiliar with the relevant characteristics of the verbal and non-verbal behaviors of people from other cultures. Specific patterns of behavior associated with dishonesty in one cultural context may not be perceived as suspicious behavior in other cultures (Giles et al., 2021). To some extent, detecting lies can be achieved in cross-cultural situations, but a judge must have access to both auditory and visual evidence (AlSimadi, 2000). While samples based on verbal and non-verbal cues have been examined extensively in English-speaking and\nFrontiers in Psychology 02 frontiersin.org\nWestern cultures, few studies have included large numbers of Asian participants (Cheng and Broadhurst, 2005; Levitan et al., 2015).\nResearchers have also paid close attention to individual differences in deceptive behavior, including gender (Zhang et al., 2017), age (Ruffman et al., 2012), and personality traits (Semrad et al., 2019). The studies have extensively studied healthy individuals; however, relatively few studies have examined whether lying and truth-telling differ between individuals with brain damage and healthy individuals. Ceceli et al. (2022) reported that drug addiction is associated with prefrontal cortex damage that affects emotional, cognitive, and behavioral functions. The deception and the detection of deception are closely related to these factors (Sporer, 2016). Drug addicts often lie to others to hide signs of addiction, which may lead to severe problems in interpersonal relationships. However, few studies have included a sample of people with drug addiction to research the differences between deception and its detection.\nIn this study, we develop a novel deception database called C2W2D, a free resource containing 168 videos (84 deceptive videos and 84 honest videos). We review related research and introduce the advantages of the werewolf game approach, which is followed by the development and selection of video clips for inclusion in the database. To the best of our knowledge, the C2W2D filled the gap by developing a Chinese adult deception database under natural conditions (drug addicts and healthy undergraduates), which may enable the exploration of individual and cross-cultural differences in deception research with high ecological validity."

(2013) asked participants to provide their actual or faked whereabouts at a specified date and time (e.g., \u201cwhere were you on the last Saturday night from 7:00 to 10:00 p.m.\u201d). Similarly, Radlak et al. (2015) enrolled 101 participants who observed a simple geometric shape with the inscription \u201ctruth\u201d or \u201clie\u201d in sequence on a laptop screen and were asked to either tell the truth or lie about what they saw, yielding 101 videos. Lloyd et al. (2019) recruited 80 participants (black people and white people) to talk about individual events (e.g., \u201cDescribe a person you dislike as if you like them\u201d). This database contained 320 videos. In opinion paradigms, participants are instructed to comment on social issues (e.g., \u201cShould convict cold-blooded murderers be executed?\u201d) and then speak truthfully or deceitfully about a particular opinion (Frank and Ekman, 1997; Leal et al., 2010). As controlled methods may generate few lies and unmotivated deceptions, paradigms based on lab conditions may have less ecological validity and are unable to generalize real-life situations (Wright et al., 2013; Delgado-Herrera et al., 2021; Kihlstrom, 2021)."

While deceptive behaviors are taking place, it is difficult to capture them intentionally. In addition, artificially simulating the deception paradigm with high stakes may engender serious ethical concerns (Fornaciari and Poesio, 2013). Thus, court trials and mock crime paradigms have usually been used to collect datasets. For example, Fornaciari and Poesio (2012) created a corpus including 3,015 utterances (1,202 honest ones, 945 false ones, and 868 uncertain ones) from hearings in Italian courts. P\u00e9rez-Rosas et al. (2015) also introduced a database containing 121 video clips (61\ndeceptive ones and 60 truthful ones) collected from public court trials. In mock crime paradigms, Ten Brinke et al. (2014) asked people (N = 12) to tell the truth and lie about stealing $100. Wang et al. (2021) adapted a mafia game for collecting 280 videos, including 110 spies (deception) and 170 villagers (truth)."

The players then participate in voting to decide who is most likely to be a werewolf. It is noteworthy that the players can abstain from voting. Once the majority of the players vote for a player to die, the moderator declares that the particular player is dead and the player is shown in their cards. If someone wants to protest his/her innocence\nor reveal some information, such as the true result of the seer\u2019s vision, he/she must do so before the end of the voting process. No player is allowed to reveal his/her cards to anyone unless the opponent is killed. All the players are not allowed to talk. Once a certain player is voted to death, the night phase is initiated, and the cycle is repeated. This process is continued until one side wins (refer to Figure 1).\nWerewolves who cannot tell lies effectively can be exposed as liars very easily and may even be \u201ckilled.\u201d On the other hand, if a villager/god cannot convince his/her potential teammates that he or she is telling the truth, they may be thought of being a werewolf and expelled. Even though all the players are capable of lying or telling the truth, few werewolves are able to expose themselves actively to the spotlight. Furthermore, it is important to stay in line with potential teammates. As soon as lying is detected, the logical line constructed by all teammates may be broken, resulting in a loss. In this scenario, the player must pay more cognitive effort and enhance motivation to lie or tell the truth to succeed. Thus, using the \u201cwerewolf\u201d game has the following advantages: (1) obtaining samples of deception and honesty without any control and (2) in contrast to traditional one-to-one communication, deceptive and honest behaviors occur in multi-person intergroup communication, which may be closer to reality. In the C2W2D, an additional 10 CNY (Chinese Yuan) is earned if a player presented a fool-proof performance during one round of the game."

We developed the C2W2D based on the paradigm of the \u201cwerewolf\u201d deception game. In the C2W2D, 1,738,760 frames of facial data are stored in 168 video clips (84 deceptive videos and 84 honest videos) from 26 drug addicts and 58 healthy undergraduates.\nAn examination of the mean values of presence and intensity of each AU per player is conducted to differentiate lying from truth-telling.

Hence, in the healthy undergraduates participating in this study, the emotion of happiness might be a predictor of deception to some extent. In addition, emotional cues such as fear and anger might also leak from healthy undergraduates in the C2W2D. Moreover, AU10 is a reliable cue for differentiating truth-telling from lying in our database. In contrast, drug addicts did not exhibit significant differences. In our analysis, the numbers of frames of healthy undergraduates are much higher than those of drug addicts (approximately 14:1), which may have led to bias in the drug addicts\u2019 results. Alternately, Goldstein and Volkow (2002) revealed that four circuits in the brain are involved in drug abuse and addiction as follows: (1) nucleus accumbens and ventral pallidum; (2) orbitofrontal cortex and subcallosal cortex; (3) amygdala and hippocampus; and (4) prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate. Meanwhile, emotional processing appears to be interlocked with perception, cognition, motivation, and action, which is closely related to the amygdala and the prefrontal cortex (Pessoa, 2018). Drug use and dependence, particularly excessive drug seeking and taking,\nadversely affect these networks with fundamental changes in cognition and emotional processing (Zilverstand et al., 2018; Natale Salvatore et al., 2022). Thus, in the current study, the negative results found in drug addicts may have been caused by leaking different emotional expressions when lying or telling the truth as compared with healthy undergraduates.\nFurthermore, studies have extensively investigated emotional expressions of deception in healthy people, while drug addicts who suffer from a range of emotional, cognitive, and behavioral alterations, as well as the desire to escape social problems, often lie (Marvin, 1968; Weir, 1972). However, few studies have tested their leakage of different cues, which is likely due to the lack of a unique database. Thus, we collected drug addicts\u2019 samples for future research.\nAlthough the results of the current study show some significant differences in some AUs, the use of these indicators to detect a liar remains to be tested. Additional potential indicators are also worth mentioning. Shen et al. (2021) found that the total duration of AU20 of fear under the lying condition is less than that under the truth-telling condition,\nFrontiers in Psychology 07 frontiersin.org\nand facial movements around the eyes are more asymmetrical when people are telling lies as compared when telling the truth with high stakes. The pitch of speech and pupil dilation have also been linked to deception in some studies (DePaulo et al., 2003; Levine, 2020). According to Darwin\u2019s proposition, for finding cues to deception, Ekman (2003) proposed the emotional \u201cinhibition hypothesis,\u201d which has gained some empirical traction (Porter and ten Brinke, 2008). Collectively, the leaked emotions can be used as cues of deception, although they are not deception per se and are just closely linked with deception.\nFor common people, detecting deceptive emotional cues is a challenging task. It is, therefore, imperative to use automated deception detection to detect liars quickly and efficiently. A primary method of detecting deception is through the use of computer algorithms, which perform effectively based on big data to build computer vision models. Unfortunately, few deception databases with high ecological validity under natural conditions can be accessed by the public (especially from Asia). Another goal of developing the C2W2D is to enable the extraction of spontaneous micro-expressions, which has attained considerable attention from the deception and\nemotion research communities. Micro-expressions are reported to be the uncontrolled leakage of an emotional cue, which are estimated to be between 0.04 and 0.5 s in duration (Shen et al., 2012; Yan et al., 2014). While it is difficult to observe micro-expressions with the naked eye, they can be effectively detected via computer vision. Furthermore, computer vision algorithms also require an extensive amount of data for microexpression recognition. However, the existing micro-expression database is developed primarily under laboratory conditions with low ecological validity (Yan et al., 2014; Li et al., 2022). Accordingly, the C2W2D may further evolve into a microexpression database with a high ecological database. Meanwhile, we consider that catching liars is a process of integrating all the potential deception cues, rather than being limited to a single cue. Thus, while developing the C2W2D, we also intentionally recorded players\u2019 postures and voice cues. As far as we learned, applying multi cues to detect deception currently is a hot topic and can significantly improve the accuracy of detecting deception.\nThe critical aspect of developing a deception database is how to elicit deception. In other words, what is the most effective method of eliciting deception? As a result of the\nFrontiers in Psychology 08 frontiersin.org\nlimitations of the law, data with high ecological validity, such as suspect interrogations, may not be accessible. We, therefore, implement the \u201cwerewolf\u201d game deception paradigm under natural conditions. As compared with the traditional methods of developing deception databases, the C2W2D is developed by observing group-to-group interactions in which the identification of telling truths or lies is more complex as compared with one-to-one situations. The competition between the two groups (werewolves vs. gods and villagers) may have resulted in players introducing more authentic emotion leakage and applying more cognitive effort, as well as feeling more fear, which is likely to have contributed to producing deception with high ecological validity.\nIn the field of deception detection, a critical element for discriminating lies from truths is finding deception cues. Factors, such as ecological validity, cross-cultural differences, and individual differences, can cause the leakage of different emotional deception cues, which have recently received increasing attention within the deception community. It is likely that an important reason for the development of these domains being limited is the lack of adequate samples. Thus, the main aim of this study is to provide a relatively sizable number of deceptive and honest samples from Chinese undergraduates and drug addicts. We do not expect that the C2W2D will replace all the existing deception databases, although it was developed under naturalistic conditions."
