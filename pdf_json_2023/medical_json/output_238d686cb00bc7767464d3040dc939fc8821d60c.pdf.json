    "abstractText": "Bacterial infection is a major threat to global public health, which urgently requires useful tools to rapidly analyze pathogens in the early stages of infection. Herein, we develop a smart macrophage (M\u00f8)-based bacteria detector, which can recognize, capture, enrich and detect different bacteria and their secreted exotoxins. We transform the fragile native M\u00f8s into robust gelated cell particles (GM\u00f8s) using photo-activated crosslinking chemistry, which retains membrane integrity and recognition capacity for different microbes. Meanwhile, these GM\u00f8s equipped with magnetic nanoparticles and DNA sensing elements can not only respond to an external magnet for facile bacteria collection, but allow the detection of multiple types of bacteria in a single assay. Additionally, we design a propidium iodide-based staining assay to rapidly detect pathogen-associated exotoxins at ultralow concentrations. Overall, these nanoengineered cell particles have broad applicability in the analysis of bacteria, and could potentially be used for the management and diagnosis of infectious diseases.",

Herein, we develop a smart macrophage (M\u00f8)-based bacteria detector, which can recognize, capture, enrich and detect different bacteria and their secreted exotoxins. We transform the fragile native M\u00f8s into robust gelated cell particles (GM\u00f8s) using photo-activated crosslinking chemistry, which retains membrane integrity and recognition capacity for different microbes. Meanwhile, these GM\u00f8s equipped with magnetic nanoparticles and DNA sensing elements can not only respond to an external magnet for facile bacteria collection, but allow the detection of multiple types of bacteria in a single assay. Additionally, we design a propidium iodide-based staining assay to rapidly detect pathogen-associated exotoxins at ultralow concentrations. Overall, these nanoengineered cell particles have broad applicability in the analysis of bacteria, and could potentially be used for the management and diagnosis of infectious diseases.\nThe pathogenic infection is a leading cause of death worldwide, which causes epidemics and huge public expenditure1,2. Recently, the evolution of bacteria has been greatly promoted because of the misuse and overuse of antibiotics. Consequently, the emergence of various drug-resistant strains, such as methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, multidrug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae and multidrugresistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa and so forth, has become a severe problem for clinical acquired infections3\u20135. The AMR Review published in the United Kingdom estimated that about 700,000 people worldwide die of drug-resistant bacteria infection every year, and this number will increase to 10 million by 2050, with an estimated economic loss of 100 trillion dollars6. Therefore, approaches to efficiently identify pathogens are urgently needed to control bacterial transmission and facilitate anti-infection therapy.\nCurrently, plate culture is widely used for bacterial identification; however, the main drawback of this method lies in its long analysis time (usually more than 48 h) and the requirement of specialized culture conditions7, which limits its speed and availability. Nucleic acid tests (e.g., polymerase chain reaction, PCR) using nucleic acid primers have excellent sensitivity, but these tests suffer from a complicated workflow (e.g., cell lysis, nucleic acid extraction, magnetic separation, washing and amplification, etc.) and require expensive protein enzymes and thermal cyclers8\u201310. Alternatively, immunological tests such as lateral flow strip-based assay are an attractive platform for detecting pathogens because of their simplicity, low cost, and rapid signal generation11,12. However, frequently, a pair of high-quality bioreceptors (e.g., antibodies or aptamers) must be screened and optimized for both recognizing and sensing in a sandwich-type immunoassay, which restricts the sensor design and deployment. Meanwhile, the information on the targeted bacteria should be known in advance. When the pathogens are unknown, it is difficult to choose appropriate bioreceptors for bacteria capture and detection13.

However, approaches that can simultaneously analyze both bacterial cells and their virulence factors are still rarely explored.\nOver millions of years of evolution, innate immune cells such as macrophages (M\u00f8s), dendritic cells, and neutrophils have optimized an incredible recognition capacity for a broad-spectrum of pathogens and their virulence factors15. Typically, these immune cells can\u2019t recognize a certain bacterium but rely on a set of surface receptors such as toll-like receptors (TLRs)16, mannose receptors17, scavenger receptors18, and complement receptors19 and so forth to bind given components of pathogens (known as pathogenassociated molecular patterns, PAMPs)20. Among them, mannose receptor (MR), a 180 kDa transmembrane protein, is able to recognize the patterns of carbohydrates on the infectious agents such as Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, yeasts, and parasites21. When immune cells are stimulated by cytokines, pathogens and their products, the upregulation of MR can significantly enhance their recognition and phagocytosis capacity for battling infection22,23. In view of the strong correlation between immune cells and pathogens, we envision immune cells as a useful tool for pathogen analysis. However, developing immune cells as a smart detector that can efficiently recognize, enrich, and report specific pathogen remains a big challenge because of the following reasons. First, living M\u00f8s have low mechanical stability, which is fragile to various operations and easily damaged, making it difficult to practical use. Second, cells are not facilely manipulated, which frequently involves multiple centrifugation and washing steps, making them inconvenient for routine applications. Last but not least, immune cells can\u2019t distinguish specific bacteria species, let alone produce detectable signals even though they recognize and bind pathogens.\nHerein, we report a facile strategy to transform livingM\u00f8s into a smart bacteria detector by combining the intracellular hydrogelation technique and DNA nanotechnology. Very recently, Hu and coworkers described a facile hydrogelation approach to assemble synthetic hydrogels inside the cells without disturbing the fluid and functional plasma membranes, making them suitable for\nsubsequent biological application (e.g., ex vivo T cell modulation)24,25. In this work, we apply this intracellular hydrogelation technique to transform M\u00f8s and the resulting gelated M\u00f8s (GM\u00f8s) can successfully overcome the abovementioned problems, making them suitable for in vitro use. With this tool in hand, we can achieve several goals: (1) GM\u00f8s have robust gelated cores and intact cell membranes, which allows them to resist different harsh conditions destructive to living cells. (2) GM\u00f8s pretreated with magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) can be manipulated by an external magnet, so we can use an external magnet to conveniently separate bacteria-adsorbed cell particles from complex biological media with minimal loss. Since the existence of a large number of impurities in the biological samples, magnetic separation plays a fundamental role in the following analysis. (3) GM\u00f8s can efficiently recognize, capture, and enrich a broad spectrum of bacteria to their surface, and the close proximity distance between bacteria and the underlying cell membrane will easily activate sensing elements or facilitate the adsorption of bacteria-associated secretions on the cell membrane, which can dramatically improve the detection performance. (4) GM\u00f8s can be decorated with responsive DNA devices (e.g., DNAzyme) for specific bacteria biosensing using a captureand-detect strategy. Moreover, because of the structural characteristics of GM\u00f8s, they can be further applied to analyze bacteriaassociated toxins, which not only provides more information about the virulence of the infected bacteria but also further extends the applicability of the GM\u00f8-based assay. To the best of our knowledge, exploring immune cells as a smart detector for pathogen analysis in vitro has not been described, which may provide a clue to rationally design next-generation cell-based biosensors for fighting against bacteria."

Of note, we use RAW264.7 (a murine macrophage cell line) which is one of the most widely used immortalized macrophages for in vitro experiments as the basic cell material because of its convenient large-scale production and easy maintenance without adding any inducers. Then, the intracellular hydrogelation is achieved by direct permeation of photoinitiators (2-hydroxyl-4\u2032-(2-hydroxyethoxy)-2-methylpropiophenone, I2959) and monomers (poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate, PEG-DA, Mw = 700Da) and subsequent UV irradiation according to previous reports24. Finally, DNA sensing elements (e.g., DNAzyme) responding to specific bacteria can be facilely decorated on the gelated cells for convenient, rapid, and highly sensitive fluorescence readout. Consequently, magnetic DNA-GM\u00f8s that can recognize, enrich, and detect multiple types of microorganisms are produced."

            "text": "We used different techniques to confirm the successful preparation of DNA-GM\u00f8s. As shown in Fig. 2a, the resulting cells (MNPs/M\u00f8s) became dark compared to natural M\u00f8s and could rapidly respond to an external magnet with a high cell recovery (\u224898%). Moreover, UV/vis spectra indicated the presence of characteristic peak of MNPs for the MNPs/GM\u00f8s sample (Supplementary Fig. 2), further suggesting the successful magnetization of the M\u00f8s. Of note, the uptake of MNPs did not affect the viability of M\u00f8s (Supplementary Fig. 3), and we also measured intracellular iron contents by inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) to quantitatively assess the cellular uptake of the MNPs at different time points (Supplementary Fig. 4).

As a comparison, other potential markers such as TLR2 and TLR4 that can bind to bacterial components were also tested. The expression of CD163 and CD206 but not TLR2 and TLR4 was significantly promoted using IL-4 stimulation (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Fig. 5), consistent with previous reports22,28. The up-regulation of CD206 and CD163 implied that they could have more chances to capture bacteria compared with TLR receptors. Subsequently, the formation of hydrogel networks in the intracellular region was confirmedbyfluorescencemicroscopy. The hydrogel networkwas stained with green fluorescence by introduction of fluoresceindiacrylate into the cross-linker mixture, and the cell membrane was stained with a lipophilic Dil fluorophore with red fluorescence. The resultant GM\u00f8s exhibited discriminative membranous and hydrogel parts (Fig. 2c), suggesting the successful intracellular hydrogelation, which is in well agreement with the previous results25. Also, the water exposure assay could be used to rapidly evaluate the hydrogelation of M\u00f8s since living M\u00f8s rapidly ruptured under hypo-osmotic stress25, whereas GM\u00f8s with robust crosslinked interiors remained intact without obvious morphology change (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 6). Transmission electronmicroscopy (TEM) results demonstrated that GM\u00f8s had a perforated, hydrogel-filled interior compared with natural M\u00f8s (Fig. 2e). Meanwhile, many MNPs were also observed in the phagocytic vesicles (Fig. 2e, inset), further verifying that their magnetic response resulted from the internalization of MNPs. Also of note, these gelatedM\u00f8s stored in the PBS solution rapidly diedwithout nutrient supply (Supplementary Fig. 7); however, since the cytoplasm of GM\u00f8s is solidified by the network of hydrogel, the resulting cell particles retained their membrane integrity and membrane fluidity (Supplementary Fig. 8), suggesting that the protein receptors on the membrane could preserve their functions.\nTo facilitate the DNAmodification, we used cholesterol-labeled DNA duplex (Ch-DNA, Supplementary Table 1), which could spontaneously insert into the cell membrane via strong hydrophobic interactions. To demonstrate this, we conjugated the DNA strands with a fluorophore (i.e., FITC). GM\u00f8s were incubated in the presence of Ch/FITC-DNA (100 nM) for 15min, followed by confocal imaging. DNA strands without cholesterol were used as the control group. As shown in Fig. 2f, GM\u00f8s treated with Ch/FITC-DNA exhibited green fluorescence on the cell membrane; by contrast, cells incubated with cholesterol-free DNA strands did not show any fluorescence, thus suggesting that the successful surface immobilization of DNA molecules was due to cholesterol insertion. The average density of DNA was estimated to be 2.4 \u00d7 105 molecules/cell according to the change in fluorescence spectra (Supplementary Fig. 9)."

            "text": "To evaluate the stability of the preparedDNA-GM\u00f8s, we challenged the cells with different conditions, such as hypertonic stress, repeated freeze\u2013thaw cycles, sonication, high-speed centrifugation, and longtime storage (30 days). For a comparison, we used living M\u00f8s (LM\u00f8s) and paraformaldehyde-fixed M\u00f8s (FM\u00f8s) as controls. As shown in Fig. 3a, DNA-LM\u00f8s were rather fragile, and all treatments caused their rapid deformation (e.g., hypertonic stress), aggregation (e.g., centrifugation) or fragmentation (e.g., sonication), making them impossible for routine experiments in vitro. Although DNA-FM\u00f8s had better stability compared to DNA-LM\u00f8s, they were still susceptible to freeze\u2013thaw cycles and sonication, which destroyed the majority of cells. Impressively, DNA-GM\u00f8s survived under all conditions, evidenced by the negligible change in cell morphology and number (Fig. 3b). Overall, these results confirm the high stability of the DNAGM\u00f8s, thus facilitating their downstream applications such as pathogen capture and detection.\nIn view of the important role of DNA molecules modified on the GM\u00f8s in bacteria detection (vide infra), their stability on the cell membrane was also evaluated. Since the cells were gelated, the anchored DNA strands were not internalized into the cells, which could be displaced on the membrane for a long period without obvious loss, as evidenced by fluorescence intensity change determined by flow cytometry and confocal analysis (2 weeks, Fig. 3c). Previous reports revealed that single cholesterol-labeled DNA strands are prone to detach from the lipid membrane in a protein-rich environment29, so the retention time of DNA strands on the DNA-GM\u00f8s dispersed in complex biological media (i.e., 10% serum) was investigated using flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 3d, the fluorescence of dualcholesterol-labeled DNA-modified GM\u00f8s remained unchanged, implying the negligible detachment of DNA strands from GM\u00f8s. This improved stability was attributed to the enhanced affinity of dual cholesterols toward the cell membrane, which is important for subsequent bioapplications.\nRecognition and capture capacity of GM\u00f8s for different microbes Next, we examined the performance of GM\u00f8s for binding and isolation of pathogens using two representative bacteria, i.e., Gram-negative Escherichia coli (E. coli) and Gram-positive Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) as model pathogens. After incubating the GM\u00f8s with bacteria suspension for 15 min, the cell particles were collected using a magnet for microscope observation (Fig. 4a). Obviously, the capture capacity of the IL-4stimulated GM\u00f8s was much better than that of unstimulated GM\u00f8s for both species (Fig. 4a). The isolated bacteria were alive (Supplementary Fig. 10), which could be analyzed by plate assay. Moreover, we also prepared another gelated cell particle using MCF-7 cells (human breast cancer cell line), which is not an immune cell. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 11, the MCF-7-based particles had a weak binding tendency toward bacteria, which was significantly lower than that of GM\u00f8s, thus emphasizing the role of immune cells as the scaffold material. The colonies of E. coli and S. aureus captured by IL-4-stimulated GM\u00f8s were 4.3-fold and 5.5-fold higher than those of unstimulated GM\u00f8s (Fig. 4b, c), respectively, consistent with the microscopy results. Titration assay further verified the advantage of cytokine stimulation for bacteria capture (Supplementary Fig. 12). Also of note, when the protein receptors (i.e., MR and SR) on the GM\u00f8s were simultaneously blocked by corresponding antibodies, their capture efficiency for bacteria was obviously inhibited (Supplementary\nFig. 13), thereby emphasizing the important role of protein receptors in bacteria recognition and capture. Of note, the use of blocking antibodies could not completely inhibit the binding of bacteria to GM\u00f8s, highlighting that other receptors are likely involved. Furthermore, the bacteria capture efficiency of the stimulated GM\u00f8s slightly reduced after long-term storage (e.g., 1 month), which was beneficial to their real applications. This was probably due to the unchanged protein markers (e.g., MR and SR) on the cell membrane (Supplementary Fig. 14). Therefore, the stimulated GM\u00f8s were used for subsequent bacteria analysis.\nFigure 4d confirmed that the GM\u00f8s could be used to capture other microorganisms, including Pseudomonas aeruginosa (P. aeruginosa), Vibrio parahemolyticus (V. parahemolyticus), Salmonella enteritidis (S. enteritidis) and Candida albicans (C. albicans). When three bacteria (E. coli, S. aureus, and P. aeruginosa) were mixed in one sample, GM\u00f8s could simultaneously capture all species, thus proving the broad-spectrum capture capacity of GM\u00f8s (Supplementary Fig. 15). As a comparison, commercially available antibody-modified magnetic beads (Ab-MBs) only\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2927 4\ncaptured the corresponding bacteria due to the specific binding between antibodies and antigens on the bacteria (Supplementary\nFig. 16). Moreover, although the size of Ab-MBs (diameter = 10 \u03bcm) was compatible to that of GM\u00f8s, their capture capacity was significantly lower than that of GM\u00f8s. The performance of these particles for bacteria collection from complex media such as plasma, serum, saliva, and urine was also investigated using plate assay. Different from conventional Ab-MBs, the capture capacity of\nGM\u00f8s was not influenced by complex media (Fig. 4e), further emphasizing their advantages since biological media contain numerous impurities that may affect molecular recognition. It was not surprising that the performance of Ab-MBs was affected by many factors, such as antibody quality, modification quantity, surface fouling, and correct orientation of Abs on the beads, which all contributed to their limited capture efficiency30. In contrast, cell particles had a natural antifouling capacity and\na DNA-LM\u00f8 DNA-FM\u00f8 DNA-GM\u00f8 PB\nS H yp er to ni\nc Fr ee ze -th aw\nSo ni\nca tio n C en tr ifu ga tio n\n30 d\nay s\nb\nc Nucleus DNA DNA-GM\u00f8 After two weeks\nd\nGM\u00f8\nSerum 0 h DNA-GM\u00f8\nSerum 1 h DNA-GM\u00f8\nSerum 2 h DNA-GM\u00f8\nSerum 4 h DNA-GM\u00f8\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2927 5\nthe protein receptors could faithfully fulfill functions as long as the membrane integrity was preserved. Finally, we also confirmed that the modification of DNA molecules on the GM\u00f8s did not affect their capture capacity (Supplementary Fig. 17), which was important for subsequent bacteria analysis. Specific detection of captured bacteria using DNAzymedecorated GM\u00f8s Having confirmed the broadcapture efficacyof theGM\u00f8s,we explored the use of these particles for the specific detection of pathogens. As a proof of concept, we modified E. coli-targeting DNAzymes on the\nFig. 3 | The stability of DNA-GM\u00f8s under environmental conditions. a BrightfieldmicroscopyofDNA-modified livingM\u00f8s (DNA-LM\u00f8s), DNA-modifiedfixedM\u00f8s (DNA-FM\u00f8s), and DNA-modified gelated M\u00f8s (DNA-GM\u00f8s) with different treatments, including hypertonic stress (1M NaCl), freeze\u2013thaw cycles (3 times), sonication, high-speed centrifugation (10600 g), and long-term storage (30 days).

DzEC is selected by Li and coworkers31\u201333, which cleaves a fluorogenic DNA/RNA substrate in the presence of crude extracellular mixtures (CEMs) secreted by bacteria.\nThe sensing principle is shown in Fig. 5a. Specifically, both DzEC and substrate were immobilized on the cell membrane via a cholesterol insertion method, and the substrate had a FITC fluorophore and BHQ1 quencher. In the absence of E. coli, the hybridization between DNAzymes and substrates results in the quenching of the fluorescence of FITC. Nevertheless, in the presence of analyte, the DNAzymes were activated by living bacteria, resulting in the cleavage of the substrate and the recovery of FITC. Because of the close proximity between E. coli and DNA sensing elements on the cell membrane, we envision that the CEMs released from bacteria will more efficiently activate DNAzymes than traditional DNAzyme-based approaches, thereby bringing better detection performance.\nFigure 5b shows negligible fluorescence on the DzEC-GM\u00f8s in the absence of E. coli, suggesting the low background signal of this cellbased sensor. However, once bacteria were captured, strong green fluorescence was observed around the cell membrane, suggesting the occurrence of cleavage reactions. To further demonstrate this, we replaced the DNAzyme with a random DNA strand (rDNA), and the resulting rDNA-GM\u00f8s failed to produce any signal even after the addition of E. coli. To avoid observation bias, flow cytometry was also used to analyze the average fluorescence change of the samples, and a similar trend was observed for the DzEC-GM\u00f8s and rDNA-GM\u00f8s in the presence of E. coli (Fig. 5c), further confirming that the fluorescence was ascribed to the activation of DNAzymes. Additionally, the performanceof thismethod is not compromisedbyusing complex biological samples such as serum, saliva, and urine (Supplementary Fig. 18).\nNext,flowcytometrywas used to quantitatively detect E. coliwith a concentration ranging from 103 to 107 CFU mL\u22121 (Fig. 5d, e). Since the fluorescence signals at 500CFUmL\u22121 weredistinguishable from those at 0 CFU mL\u22121, the limit of detection (LOD) of the DzEC-GM\u00f8-based assay for E. coli detection was estimated to be 500 CFU mL\u22121 (Fig. 5e, inset), which was better than other DNAzyme-basedmethods (Supplementary\nTable 2) or the antibody-based lateral flow or dipstick devices. This enhanced sensitivity and detection efficiency were probably due to that DzEC-GM\u00f8s can enrich bacteria on their surface, the distance between bacteria and DNAzymes is greatly shortened. As a result, the local concentration of CEMs secreted by bacteria around the DzEC-GM\u00f8s is improved and the CEMs have a shorter diffusion distance to activate DNAzymes, making GM\u00f8s faster and easier to respond to analytes. The role of magnetic enrichment in bacteria detection was also verified by detecting blood samples spiked with a low-concentration E. coli (104 CFU mL\u22121). As shown in Supplementary Fig. 19, bacteria-enriched samples showed an 8.6-fold enhancement in fluorescence, thus verifying the advantageous role of the magnetic enrichment step in bacteria analysis. In addition, a large number of impurities that exist in the biological samples (e.g., exfoliated cells, blood cells or cell debris) dramatically disrupt the analysis, while a simple magnetic enrichment and separation step can address these problems34. This method is highly specific, and other bacteria such as S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, V. parahemolyticus, Streptococcus pyogenes (S. pyogenes), and C. albicans could not produce detectable signals (Fig. 5f).\nThe sensitivity to detect a single live bacterium is a long-term pursuit for a bacterial detection method in consideration of its applications in the field of infection diagnostics and food safety. To address this problem, we developed a single DzEC-GM\u00f8-based assay, in which only one DzEC-GM\u00f8 was used and analyzed after adding bacteria. In this approach, all reactions occurred on one cell particle; moreover, only a fraction of the activated DNAzymes is sufficient to produce a detectable signal, making the assay much more sensitive than traditional methods for detecting the average fluorescence intensity. To demonstrate this, CEMs secreted by E. coli\ncorresponding to 1 CFU were incubated with different concentrations of DzEC-GM\u00f8s (G1-G4: 1, 10, 102, 103 cells) for 0.5 h. After activation, cells were analyzed using a fluorescence microscope. The preparation of a single cell-based assay is shown in Supplementary\nFig. 20. As shown in Fig. 5g, as the GM\u00f8 number decreased, the fluorescence significantly increased and the group containing a single DzEC-GM\u00f8 produced the highest signal, thus confirming the feasibility of our approach for single-live-cell detection.\nThe design principle of our GM\u00f8-based bacteria detector is highly generalizable and can be easily adapted to other bacteria by changing the used DNAzyme. To verify this, we constructed another GM\u00f8-based biosensor using a methicillin-resistant S. aureus-specific DNAzyme (denoted as DzSA-GM\u00f8)35 and demonstrated that S. aureus can trigger the activation of DNAzymes on the GM\u00f8with sensitivity and specificity comparable to those observed with the DzEC-GM\u00f8 (Supplementary Fig. 21).\nBecause of their specific response to corresponding targets, different DNAzymes can be decorated orthogonally on the GM\u00f8 for bacteria detection without crosstalk. To verify this, we modified two DNAzymes targeting E. coli and S. aureus (termed as DzECSA-GM\u00f8) on the cell membrane (Fig. 5h). Each enzyme labeled with a fluorophore (FITC or rhodamine, Rh) could bind to the corresponding bacteriasecreted CEMs and cleave their substrate, resulting in the recovery of fluorescence. The introduction of oneof the twobacteria in the sample lightened the specific DNAzyme and only addition of both bacteria we observed the recovery of the two fluorophores (Fig. 5i).\nAnalysis of pore-forming toxins using GM\u00f8s To further broaden the applicability of the GM\u00f8-based platform, we used it to analyze pore-forming toxins (PFTs) secreted by bacteria. \u03b1Hemolysin (Hl\u03b1) is a well-known exotoxin that disrupts cells by forming pores in cellular membranes and causing their penetration imbalances36. Therefore, developing effective strategies for accurate, rapid, and sensitive detection of this toxin is of great importance for profiling the virulence of pathogens.\nThe sensing principle is shown in Fig. 6a. The binding event between the GM\u00f8 membranes and the target toxin results in the formation ofpores on the cellmembrane, thus facilitating the permeation of fluorescent molecules (i.e., propidium iodide, PI), an impermeable dye to nondestructive membranes. Subsequently, the PI fluorescence in the cells could be rapidly analyzed by fluorescence microscopy or flow cytometry analysis. In the absence of Hl\u03b1, GM\u00f8s remained dark during the experiment (Fig. 6b). In contrast, red fluorescence in the GM\u00f8s was gradually observed after adding 100nM of Hl\u03b1 and reached a plateau at 25min, suggesting the formation of pores on the membrane and permeation of PI dyes. Furthermore, when anti-Hl\u03b1 antibodies were introduced into the system, the PI signal was significantly decreased (Supplementary Fig. 22), which was due to the neutralization effect of antibodies, further confirming the fluorescence of GM\u00f8s was due to the damage of Hl\u03b1 toxin.\nBased on the above results, we used a single GM\u00f8-based assay for the ultrasensitive detection of Hl\u03b1. Specifically, one GM\u00f8 was incubated with different concentrations of toxin and then stained with PI dyes. As shown in Fig. 6c, PI fluorescence of the GM\u00f8 increased as the concentration of the toxin increased. Since the fluorescence signals at 10 fM were distinguishable from the background signals, the limit of detection (LOD) of the PI staining assay for Hl\u03b1 detection was estimated to be 10 fM (Fig. 6d, inset), which was significantly lower than the previously reported whole-cell-based hemolytic assay (nM range)37, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (pM range)38, fluorescence assay (pM range)39 and field effect transistor sensors (nM)40, further emphasizing the advantage of our approach for pathogenassociated toxin analysis (Supplementary Table 3). Of note, the intact structure of GM\u00f8s could exclude PI dyes for at least 2 weeks (Supplementary Fig. 23), which ensured its real applications. Finally, we tested\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:2927 8\na 0 min 5 min 10 min 15 min 20 min 25 min\n+ To\nxi n\n- T ox\nin\nb\n1 pM 100 pM 1 nM\n0 fM 10 fM 100 fM\nc d\nNonpathogenic Pathogenic E. coli DH5\u03b1 S. cerevisiae V. parahemolyticus S. pyogenes P. aeruginosa C. albicans e\n------------------------------------------------------------- -------------------------------------------------------------\nDNAzyme PI signalf\nFig. 6 | Analysis of bacteria-secreted pore-forming toxins. a Schematic illustration of GM\u00f8-based method for PFT analysis. b Real-time monitoring of the PI fluorescence of GM\u00f8s in the absence or presence of Hl\u03b1 (100 nM).

To rapidly obtain fluorescence signal, we used flow cytometry analysis to measure the PI fluorescenceof GM\u00f8s after incubatingwith different concentrations of ClyA, and results confirmed the successful quantitatively analysis of ClyA (Supplementary Fig. 24).\nThe method was further employed to analyze the disruption effect of different bacteria on cellmembranes. To this end, GM\u00f8s were incubated with fresh pathogenic or nonpathogenic bacteria (103 CFU mL-1) and then subjected to a PI staining experiment. Among these microorganisms, E. coli DH5\u03b1 and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae) are mild strains that do not secrete hemolytic toxins, while V. parahemolyticus, S. pyogenes, P. aeruginosa, and C. albicans are known to secrete PFTs or directly damage cell membranes. For example, V. parahemolyticus secretes thermostable direct hemolysin (TDH) that can form pores in themembrane lipid bilayer41; S. pyogenes produces a membrane-damaging protein, i.e., streptolysin O and P. aeruginosa cooperatively use exolysin (ExlA) and Type IV Pili to exert its cytotoxic activity by promoting close contact between bacteria and the host cell42,43. As for C. albicans, it forms hyphae or secretes candidalysin to cause cell membrane damage44. As depicted in Fig. 6e, only GM\u00f8s treatedwith the secretions obtained frompathogenic bacteria showed strong PI fluorescence (i.e., V. parahemolyticus, S. pyogenes, P. aeruginosa, and C. albicans), suggesting the destructiveness of these microorganisms toward immune cells. As a comparison, the hemolytic assay required at least 12 h to produce detectable signals at the same bacteria concentration (Supplementary Fig. 25).\nWe also used DzSA-GM\u00f8s to analyze real sputum samples of S. aureus-caused pneumonia patients collected from a local hospital. After a simple capture-and-detect step, the resulting DzSA-GM\u00f8s were collected by an external magnetic field and subjected to flow cytometry analysis. In this assay, the presence of S. aureus in the samples would activate the DNAzymes, generating green fluorescence on the cell membranes, and Hl\u03b1 could punch GM\u00f8s and cause an increase in PI fluorescence. As shown in Fig. 6f, all patient samples generated a positive signal for S. aureus (left panel), which was ascribed to the activation of DNAzymes on the gelated cell particles. Meanwhile, PI staining experiment (right panel) showed thatnot all S. aureus secreted Hl\u03b1 (i.e., P2 and P5), which was in agreement with the results of the conventional hemolytic assay (Supplementary Fig. 26). More details are shown in Supplementary Fig. 27. These results revealed that our method had the ability to rapidly analyze bacteria and toxin in clinical samples."

The intracellular hydrogelation of M\u00f8s greatly improves their mechanical stability compared to native cells, and the successful magnetization of M\u00f8s by internalization of MNPs also improves their operability, thus making it possible to facilely deploy these cell particles in practical use. Because of themild fabrication process, the resultant GM\u00f8s not only retain their recognition capacity to capture and enrich a broadspectrum of microorganisms (e.g., bacteria and fungi) but can also be modified with DNA sensing elements for specifically reporting multiple types of bacteria in a single assay. Furthermore, taking advantage of a single-cell analysis platform, the influence of microorganisms on the immune cells can be analyzed and exotoxins secreted from pathogenic bacteria can be quantified with improved performance compared to traditional methods. Expanding the functionality of naturally existing entities is one of the exciting fields in biotechnology, our study realizes this concept without involving complex genetic operations and proposes design rules that allow many other cells and DNA elements to be jointly used as smart tools guiding cell detection and clinical diagnostics."

The final products were centrifuged and stored in PBS at 4 \u00b0C before use. To capture bacteria, 50\u03bcL of Ab-SiMBs (1 \u00d7 105 particles) solution was incubated with 50\u03bcL of bacteria suspension (final OD600 nm =0.2\u20130.3) for 15min at room temperature with continuous shaking (350 rpm). Then, the Ab-SiMBs were separated by an external magnet and washed with PBS twice. After that, 5\u03bcL of Ab-SiMB solution was subjected to confocal microscopy analysis (Carl Zeiss LSM880, Germany).\nFor collecting bacteria from complex media, GM\u00f8s or Ab-SiMBs were used to capture E. coli and S. aureus spiked in 10% human plasma, 10% human serum, 20% saliva, and 20% urine in the same way as described above."
