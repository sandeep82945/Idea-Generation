    "abstractText": "This article describes the phenomena affecting the wear of the rotor of the working mechanism in a hydraulic satellite motor. The basic geometrical relationships that allow the calculation of the coordinates of the points of contact between the satellite and the rotor and the curvature are presented. A method for calculating the number of contacts of the satellite teeth with the rotor teeth and of the satellite teeth with the curvature teeth during one revolution of the rotor is proposed. A method of calculating the forces acting at the points of contact of the satellite with the rotor and the curvature is also proposed, as well as a method of calculating the stress in the tooth contact of the interacting components of the mechanism. The results of calculations of forces and stresses in tooth contact in a satellite mechanism consisting of a four-hump rotor and a six-hump curvature are presented. It is shown that the two chambers around the satellite are in the same phase in a certain range of the rotation angle of the rotor, i.e. in the emptying phase or in the filling phase. This results in the value of the force acting on the satellite resulting from the pressure difference being zero. It has also been shown that the most important parameters affecting tooth wear are the pressure difference in the working chambers of the satellite mechanism and the rotor speed.",

The basic geometrical relationships that allow the calculation of the coordinates of the points of contact between the satellite and the rotor and the curvature are presented. A method for calculating the number of contacts of the satellite teeth with the rotor teeth and of the satellite teeth with the curvature teeth during one revolution of the rotor is proposed. A method of calculating the forces acting at the points of contact of the satellite with the rotor and the curvature is also proposed, as well as a method of calculating the stress in the tooth contact of the interacting components of the mechanism. The results of calculations of forces and stresses in tooth contact in a satellite mechanism consisting of a four-hump rotor and a six-hump curvature are presented. It is shown that the two chambers around the satellite are in the same phase in a certain range of the rotation angle of the rotor, i.e. in the emptying phase or in the filling phase. This results in the value of the force acting on the satellite resulting from the pressure difference being zero. It has also been shown that the most important parameters affecting tooth wear are the pressure difference in the working chambers of the satellite mechanism and the rotor speed.\nThe basic and main component in a hydrostatic drive system is the positive displacement pump. It is the component in the system where the greatest pressure increase occurs1\u20135. The second important component in the system is the rotary hydraulic motor. It is the displacement machine and the executive in the drive system. Its role is to convert hydraulic power into mechanical power. Today, there are many design variations of different types of hydraulic displacement machines on the world market\u2014from piston machines to gear machines. They are used in the drive systems of various machines and even in laboratory test benches6. Work on the further development of the design of these machines and the improvement of their main operating parameters are still being carried out6\u201311. There are also attempts to describe the influence of various factors on the phenomena occurring in these machines12\u201315. Tests are also being conducted to verify the operation of these machines under various environmental conditions, such as thermal shocks16\u201318.\nOver the past 30\u00a0years, intensive design and development work has been carried out on innovative designs of gear displacement machines. These are machines whose working mechanism consists of non-circular toothed elements. This mechanism is commonly referred to as a satellite mechanism. Examples of satellite mechanisms as used in positive displacement machines are shown in Fig.\u00a01.\nThe inner element of the satellite mechanism, mounted on a shaft, is called the rotor (or planet). The outer element is the curvature. The circular gear elements are the satellites. The photos above show only two types of mechanisms, namely the 4 \u00d7 5 and 4 \u00d7 6 types. The numbers in the type designation of the mechanism indicate the number of humps on the rotor and the number of humps on the curvature.\nThe following types of satellite mechanisms are known in the literature:\n\u2013 type 2 \u00d7 222\u201326; \u2013 type 2 \u00d7 327\u201330; \u2013 type 2 \u00d7 422,24\u201326,30\u201334; \u2013 type 3 \u00d7 422,27,28,30,35\u201339; \u2013 type 4 \u00d7 520,21;\nOPEN"

Due to the fact that this literature is directly accessible (online), this methodology will not be summarized here. As already shown above, the satellite mechanism is a specific gear mechanism. The literature on gears and spur gears, regarding their design methods, kinematics and characteristics is also very extensive and widely available, for example in Refs.54\u201358. Literature on gearbox elements failures and their diagnosis are also available, for example in Refs.59\u201361. However, it is no less concerned with gears mounted on axles or shafts. That is, as in typical gears. The methodology for calculation the stresses in the teeth is also known for these gears and described in literature, for example in Refs.57,62. As can be seen in Fig.\u00a01, the satellites in a satellite mechanism, are not fixed to an axle/shaft. The methodology for designing such mechanisms is already known19,39. On the other hand, there is a lack of sound knowledge on the method for calculation of the strength in the teeth of such mechanisms. Yes, methods for calculation the strength of teeth are known in the literature, but for gears with non-circular gears mounted on shafts. In Ref.63, for example, it was found that non-circular gear teeth are as strong in bending as circular gear teeth and for design purposes, classical spur gear theory can be used to predict static bending stresses. The analysis was carried out using a finite-element stress analysis. In Ref.64 an algorithm for mesh generation or the discretisation of gear tooth profiles of non-circular gear elements for static stress evaluation with FEM (Finite Element Method) was described. In Ref.65 the deformation of the teeth of a noncircular elliptical gear was analysed. It was found that the actual load on the teeth is variable and the deformation of cooperating pairs of teeth is also variable. This results from the smooth change in the gear ratio, which affects the change in the force acting on the individual teeth. Also in Refs.66,67 the mathematical formulae for analysis of the forces in planetary mechanism with eliptical gears were described. The planetary gear mechanism was also considered in Ref.67. In this publication the problem arising from the treatment of the pitch point force is described. In addition, the forces occurring in the gear and the efficiency of the gear are described, which is the main focus of the article.\nThe currently manufactured satellite mechanisms (especially 4 \u00d7 6) were designed to be made by chiselling38,49,68,69. In these mechanisms, the shape of the rotor consists of circular arcs with different radii and tangents to each other39. In this way, mechanisms with a tooth module of 1.5\u00a0mm were produced. Over time, manufacturers of satellite motors copied the shape of mechanisms made in this way and scaled them to other sizes, especially smaller sizes, with a smaller module of teeth. This allowed manufacturers to start production of other sizes of satellite motors70,71, with smaller working mechanisms using the wire electrical discharge machining (the so-called WEDM method).\nObject of research, research problem and the goal of analysis Unusual wear of the rotor\u2019s teeth was noticed during laboratory testing of a prototype of hydraulic motor (Fig.\u00a02) equipped with a 4 \u00d7 6 satellite mechanism. The specific wear occurs at the convexity (at the hump) of the rotor. However, no such wear was observed on the curvature teeth (Fig.\u00a03).\nTherefore, an attempt must be made to explain what influences such tooth wear. It is probably caused by exceeding the permissible pressures in the contact of the teeth of the interacting elements of the working mechanism. Therefore, it is advisable to analyze the loads acting on the teeth, which are influenced by the pressure difference acting on the satellite (resulting from the motor load and mechanical and pressure losses in the motor) and rotational speed of the rotor (motor shaft), resulting in inertial forces acting on the satellite. The number of contacts between the teeth of the rotor and the satellite and the number of contacts between the teeth of the curvature and the satellite also depends on the speed of rotation of the motor shaft. It is also advisable calculation\nFigure\u00a01. Examples of satellite mechanisms: type 4 \u00d7 5 (left) and type 4 \u00d7 6 (right)19\u201321.\n3 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:17028 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-44319-9\nthe stresses in the contact of the teeth of the interacting elements and calculation of the permissible stresses in the contact of the teeth.\nIn order to calculate the loads acting on the teeth of the mechanism components, it is necessary to determine:\n(1) the basic geometrical relationships in the satellite mechanism; (2) the number of contacts of the satellite\u2019s teeth with those of the rotor and the curvature during the rotation of the rotor; (3) the acceleration of the satellite as a function of the angle of rotation of the shaft (of the rotor); (4) pressures in the working chambers adjacent to the satellite.\nThus, as can be seen, the above-mentioned publication examples relate to various gears, the common feature of which is that the gears are mounted on an axle/shaft. Therefore, this article proposes an approximate method for calculating the stresses in the tooth contact of the satellite mechanism components. This makes it possible to estimate the value of these stresses and draw conclusions about the permissible motor load and speed. Currently, satellite engine manufacturers specify different motor speed ranges depending on the size of the engine. For example, in Refs.70,71 a speed range of 400\u00a0rpm to 2200\u00a0rpm is given. On the other hand, the nominal operating pressure for most satellite motors is given as 22\u00a0MPa and for some sizes as high as 25\u00a0 MPa70,71. Therefore, the stress analyzes in the tooth contact are performed for a pressure difference in the working chambers of the motor of 25\u00a0MPa.

These publications show that for any function fR(x) describing the rotor pitch line, it is possible to determine the coordinates of the curvature pitch line. The method for determining the curvature pitch line was described in detail in the publication19. The shape of the curvature pitch line and its mathematical notation depend on the number nE of curvature humps. Regardless of the assumed number of curvature humps, the point E where the satellite touches the curvature lies on the line k passing through the rotor\u2019s center of rotation and through the point F where the satellite touches the rotor19 (Fig.\u00a04).\nThe coordinates of the point E are following:\nFigure\u00a02.

The active forces result directly from the motor load with torque M. The effect of the motor load (torque M) is the pressure difference \u2206pi in the working chambers of the motor. This pressure difference generates forces that load the interacting teeth of the elements of the working mechanism. The passive forces are the effects of the rotational speed of the motor shaft. Thus, they are the inertial forces of the satellites. These forces also have a direct influence on the load of the teeth. To determine these forces, it is necessary to calculate the total acceleration of the satellite as a function of the angle of rotation of the rotor (the shaft)."

At the present stage of consideration, it is proposed to adopt the well-known model of permissible stresses (for gears) for the satellite mechanism. Because the radii of the pitch line of the rotor and the curvature are variable, it is proposed to take their smallest values for the strength calculations (i.e. rQ and rC2 according to Fig.\u00a010). Thus, for the teeth of the interacting elements, the contact ratio \u03b5 (according to Ref.57) is propose to calculate according to the following relation:\nwhere raS\u2014the tip radius of the satellite teeth, rbS\u2014the base radius of the satellite, pbS\u2014the base pitch of the satellite teeth, ra and rb\u2014the tip radius and the base radius of the circle of radius rQ or rC2, aw\u2014the true distance between the centre of the satellite and the circle of radius rQ or the circle of radius rC2, \u03b1w\u2014the pitch pressure angle.\nFor the gear elements of the satellite mechanism which are made of the same material, it is proposed to calculate the normal stress at the contact surface of the teeth according to the following formula:\nwhere F\u2014the circumferential force at the point of contact of the teeth of the mating elements, H\u2014the length of the tooth line (the height of the satellite mechanism), E\u2014the Young\u2019s modulus of the gear material, \u03bd\u2014the Poisson\u2019s ratio of the gear material, z\u2014the theoretical number of teeth of the gear engaging the satellite, i.e. zR or zE (Fig.\u00a010), K\u2014the coefficient defined as57,62:\nwhere KA\u2014the overload factor, KH\u2014the coefficient of uneven load distribution along the length of the tooth, Kv\u2014the coefficient of dynamic force, \u03c3per\u2014permissible stress.\nAccording to Refs.57,62, the value of permissible stress in gears is calculated as follows:\nwhere\nwhere \u03c3Hlim\u2014the contact fatigue strength of gears materials, ZNT\u2014the coefficient of durability at contact load, ZL\u2014the coefficient of oil viscosity, ZR\u2014the factor of surface condition (roughness), Zv\u2014the speed factor, ZW\u2014 the coefficient of surface squeeze (deformation), ZX\u2014the size factor at contact loading, SH\u2014the safety factor at contact loading.\nIn the literature (e.g.57,62) methods for estimating the values of the above coefficients of K and Z can be found, but for typical gears, i.e. for circular interacting toothed elements. The ranges of values of these coefficients and the safety factor are given in Table\u00a01.\nIn the satellite mechanism, the satellite is not fixed on any axis. In this way, the satellite can change its position relative to the rotor and the curvature in terms of inter-tooth clearance and tip clearance. In extreme cases (with a suitable value of the tooth clearance), the tip clearance can be cancelled. Thus, the distance between the centre of the satellite and the centre of a circle of radius rQ or rC2 can vary. In extreme cases, as a result of the centrifugal forces acting on the satellite, the circumferential backlash (and even the tip clearance) in the satellitecurvature pair may be erased and the circumferential backlash and the tip clearance in the satellite-rotor pair may increase (Fig.\u00a011).\n(71)\u03b5 = \u221a raS2 \u2212 rbS2 + \u221a ra2 \u2212 rb2 \u2212 aw \u00b7 sin\u03b1w\npbS ,\n(72)\u03c3N =\n\u221a\n4\u2212 \u03b5\n6\u03c0 \u00b7\n(\n1+ z\nzS\n)\n\u00b7 F\nH \u00b7 rS \u00b7\nE\n1\u2212 \u03bd2 \u00b7\nK\nsin\u03b1w \u00b7 cos\u03b1p \u2264 \u03c3per,\n(73)K = KA \u00b7 Kv \u00b7 KH,\n(74)\u03c3per = \u03c3Hlim\nSH \u00b7 Z,\n(75)Z = ZNT \u00b7 ZL \u00b7 ZR \u00b7 Zv \u00b7 ZW \u00b7 ZX,\nFigure\u00a010.

This force is the effect of the circumferential backlash CB (Fig.\u00a011) and is created when the pressure in the working chambers adjacent to the satellite changes abruptly. So this process takes place for \u03b1R = 180nE , \u03b1R = 180 nE + \u03b1R (C) , \u03b1R = 180nR , \u03b1R = 180 nR + \u03b1R (C) e.t.c. (Fig.\u00a09), where \u03b1R(C) is given by Eq.\u00a0(62). The value of the impact force Fim of the satellite tooth on the rotor tooth can be calculated according to the formula:\nwhere t\u2014the duration of the impact, H\u2014the height of the satellite, mS\u2014the mass of the satellite.\nParameters of the tested satellite mechanism The satellite mechanism type 4 \u00d7 6 (Fig.\u00a03) with a tooth module 0.6\u00a0mm was used in a hydraulic motor (Fig.\u00a02). As already mentioned in \u201cIntroduction\u201d section, this mechanism is a scaled copy of the mechanism with module 1.5\u00a0mm.

The satellite mechanism with a module of 0.6\u00a0mm was manaufactured using the wire electrical discharge machining (WEDM) process. Technical data of the satellite mechanism are presented in Table\u00a02. While Table\u00a03 shows the values of the distance between the axes, the values of the rolling pressure angle and the values of the contact ratio, assuming that in the working mechanism there is a change in the distance between the axis of the satellite and the axes of the humps of the rotor and the humps of the curvature.\nThe mechanism was made of NIMAX steel72.

(b) The accelerations of the satellite and the corresponding forces loading the teeth are a non-linear function of the rotation angle of the rotor (Figs.\u00a013, 16). (c) The highest values of the forces acting on the teeth of the satellite mechanism result from the pressure difference \u2206pS acting on the satellite. The highest value of these forces occurs for \u03b1R = 105\u00b0, i.e. when the working chamber C reaches the minimum volume VC-min (Fig.\u00a09e). The value of the forces FpE and FpF for \u03b1R = 105\u00b0 and for the pressure difference \u2206pS in two adjacent working chambers of 25\u00a0MPa is 1714 N (Fig.\u00a019).

Within this angular range, the working chambers adjacent to the satellite are in the same phase (emptying\u2014Fig.\u00a09c).\n(e) The forces FeSE, FeSF, FaE1 and FaF loading the teeth resulting from satellite accelerations and forces FcE1 and FcF due to the centrifugal force Fc have very low values of less than 1 N (Figs.\u00a015, 16, 17). The highest values of these forces occur for the rotor rotation angle \u03b1T = 33.80\u00b0 (point T is the contact point of the satellite with the rotor\u2014Fig.\u00a012). After passing the point T, the values of the forces FeSE, FeSF, FaE1 and FaF decrease rapidly due to changes in the geometric parameters of the rotor. The rapid changes in these forces do not have a significant effect on the value of the stress at the contact point of the interacting teeth due to their very small values.\nTable 8.

(g) There is a shift of the satellite towards the curvature within the limits of the tip clearances and circumferential backlash of the mating teeth; (h) At the moment when there is a step change in pressure in the working chambers (for the presented mechanism \u03b1R = 30\u00b0, 45\u00b0, 105\u00b0, 120\u00b0 etc. (Fig.\u00a09)) the tooth of the satellite hits the tooth of the rotor with the force Fim, the value of which depends especially on the value of clearance CB and may exceed the force FpF resulting directly from the pressure difference \u2206pS (Table\u00a08). (i) In ideal satellite mechanism (without clearances) the stresses in the contact of the interacting teeth do not exceed the value of allowable stresses at \u2206pS = 25\u00a0MPa only in the most optimistic calculation variant (for K = 1, SH = 1 and Z = 1.8). (j) In a real satellite mechanism, in which the impact force Fim of the satellite tooth against the planet tooth occurs, the stresses in the contact of the cooperating satellite teeth with the rotor teeth are about 4% higher (for \u2206pS = 25\u00a0MPa) than the stresses in the contact of the cooperating satellite teeth with the curvature teeth (see the results in Tables\u00a06, 9).\nIn addition, based on the results of the analyzes carried out, it can be concluded that the following factors are the reason for the rapid wear of the rotor teeth (Fig.\u00a03):\n(a) The tip clearances and circumferential backlash of the cooperating teeth, as a result of which an undesirable impact force Fim of the satellite tooth against the rotor tooth is created. (b) During the operation of the satellite mechanism, the clearance probably increases (as a result of wear), which increases the impact force Fim. (c) To large working pressure of the satellite motor (the working pressure of 25\u00a0MPa is too large for satellite mechanism). (d) High rotational speed of the rotor. As shown in \u201cThe rotation angles of the satellite and the number of teeth contacts in the mechanism\u201d section, at the rotation speed of the motor shaft n = 1500\u00a0rpm, the number of contacts of each rotor tooth with the tooth of the satellites during one minute is as much as 9600. In 1\u00a0h there are 576,000 contacts and in 10\u00a0h at least 5.76 million contacts. Considering the dynamic changes in the load on the teeth, it can be assumed that the satellite mechanism will be destroyed in a relatively short operating time.\nComparing the calculation results, given in Tables\u00a05 and 7, it can be presumed that the wear of the rotor teeth will be significantly reduced when:\n(a) The satellite mechanism will be precisely made, i.e. with minimal tip clearances and with minimal circumferential backlash (CB < 0.08 \u00d7 module). (b) The motor will be operated with such a torque load that the pressure difference \u2206pi in the working chambers does not exceed 5\u00a0MPa.\nIn summary, satellite positive displacement machines (pumps, motors) should operate at low speed and at most an average working pressure. For example, if the permissible speed of the hydraulic motor shaft is 100\u00a0rpm, the number of contacts of each rotor tooth with the satellite tooth will be only 38,400 within 1\u00a0h."
