However, the current methods for their extraction are not environmentally sustainable. The reverse \u03b2-oxidation pathway is an energy-efficient pathway that produces medium-chain fatty acids in microorganisms, and its use in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, a broadly used industrial microorganism, is desired. However, the application of this pathway in this organism has so far either led to low titers or to the predominant production of short-chain fatty acids. Results We genetically engineered Saccharomyces cerevisiae to produce the medium-chain fatty acids hexanoic and octanoic acid using novel variants of the reverse \u03b2-oxidation pathway. We first knocked out glycerolphosphate dehydrogenase GPD2 in an alcohol dehydrogenases knock-out strain (\u25b3adh1-5) to increase the NADH availability for the pathway, which significantly increased the production of butyric acid (78 mg/L) and hexanoic acid (2 mg/L) when the pathway was expressed from a plasmid with BktB as thiolase. Then, we tested different enzymes for the subsequent pathway reactions: the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase PaaH1 increased hexanoic acid production to 33 mg/L, and the expression of enoyl-CoA hydratases Crt2 or Ech was critical to producing octanoic acid, reaching titers of 40 mg/L in both cases. In all cases, Ter from Treponema denticola was the preferred trans-enoyl-CoA reductase. The titers of hexanoic acid and octanoic acid were further increased to almost 75 mg/L and 60 mg/L, respectively, when the pathway expression cassette was integrated into the genome and the fermentation was performed in a highly buffered YPD medium. We also co-expressed a butyryl-CoA pathway variant to increase the butyryl-CoA pool and support the chain extension. However, this mainly increased the titers of butyric acid and only slightly increased that of hexanoic acid. Finally, we also tested the deletion of two potential medium-chain acyl-CoA depleting reactions catalyzed by the thioesterase Tes1 and the medium-chain fatty acyl CoA synthase Faa2. However, their deletion did not affect the production titers. Conclusions By engineering the NADH metabolism and testing different reverse \u03b2-oxidation pathway variants, we extended the product spectrum and obtained the highest titers of octanoic acid and hexanoic acid reported in S. cerevisiae. Product toxicity and enzyme specificity must be addressed for the industrial application of the pathway in",

We first knocked out glycerolphosphate dehydrogenase GPD2 in an alcohol dehydrogenases knock-out strain (\u25b3adh1-5) to increase the NADH availability for the pathway, which significantly increased the production of butyric acid (78 mg/L) and hexanoic acid (2 mg/L) when the pathway was expressed from a plasmid with BktB as thiolase. Then, we tested different enzymes for the subsequent pathway reactions: the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase PaaH1 increased hexanoic acid production to 33 mg/L, and the expression of enoyl-CoA hydratases Crt2 or Ech was critical to producing octanoic acid, reaching titers of 40 mg/L in both cases. In all cases, Ter from Treponema denticola was the preferred trans-enoyl-CoA reductase. The titers of hexanoic acid and octanoic acid were further increased to almost 75 mg/L and 60 mg/L, respectively, when the pathway expression cassette was integrated into the genome and the fermentation was performed in a highly buffered YPD medium. We also co-expressed a butyryl-CoA pathway variant to increase the butyryl-CoA pool and support the chain extension. However, this mainly increased the titers of butyric acid and only slightly increased that of hexanoic acid. Finally, we also tested the deletion of two potential medium-chain acyl-CoA depleting reactions catalyzed by the thioesterase Tes1 and the medium-chain fatty acyl CoA synthase Faa2. However, their deletion did not affect the production titers.\nConclusions By engineering the NADH metabolism and testing different reverse \u03b2-oxidation pathway variants, we extended the product spectrum and obtained the highest titers of octanoic acid and hexanoic acid reported in S. cerevisiae. Product toxicity and enzyme specificity must be addressed for the industrial application of the pathway in this organism.\nKeywords Octanoic acid, Hexanoic acid, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Reverse \u03b2-oxidation pathway, Enoyl-CoA hydratase\n*Correspondence: Eckhard Boles e.boles@bio.uni-frankfurt.de Full list of author information is available at the end of the article"

            "text": "Medium-chain fatty acids (MCFAs) are six to ten hydrocarbon chain long carboxylic acids with applications in a broad range of sectors. In the food industry, MCFAderived products like methyl hexanoate and ethyl hexanoate, both responsible for the characteristic fragrance of pineapples, are derived from hexanoic acid [62, 69]. In biofuels, 1-octanol can be synthesized from octanoic acid [16]. In polymers and material science, octanoic acid can be used to synthesize polyhydroxy octanoate (PHO), a polymer with rubber-like properties of industrial interest [10, 58], but it can also be used to enhance properties like thermal storage and antibacterial capacity in functional fibers. Currently, MCFAs are either produced via non-sustainable petrochemical routes or extracted directly from palm or coconut tree seeds, representing up to 5 and 10% of the fatty acid content, respectively [43, 61, 65]. However, the extraction of these molecules and the growing demand for vegetable oils come at the price of increasing the extension of monoculture crops, which contributes to deforestation and severe loss in biodiversity [39, 40, 70].\nIn biotechnology, the short- and medium-chain fatty acids, butyric acid (up to 6\u00a0 g/L), hexanoic acid (up to 3\u00a0g/L) [6, 27, 59] or decanoic acid (up to 277\u00a0mg/L) [26] have been produced in engineered Escherichia coli via the combination of enzymes from the reverse \u03b2-oxidation with specific thioesterases. However, E. coli is not a suitable organism for the large-scale production of shortand medium-chain fatty acids due to its low tolerance to organic acids [47, 66], lower robustness and lower resistance to phages compared to other organisms like yeast [41, 50]. Among yeast, Saccharomyces cerevisiae is a preferred host for the large scale production of bulk chemicals and organic acids due to its genetic accessibility and the history of successful production of toxic compounds like organic acids, alcohols, aromatic compounds, and volatile esters [15, 18, 29, 41].\nThe most successful attempts to produce MCFAs by S. cerevisiae have so far resulted from directly engineering the fatty acid synthase (FAS), leading to titers of up to 70\u00a0mg/L of hexanoic acid and 245\u00a0mg/L of octanoic acid [11, 71]. When this approach was combined with engineering the MCFA transporters and performing adaptive laboratory evolution (ALE) to increase tolerance, titers of up to 300\u00a0 mg/L hexanoic acid, 500\u00a0 mg/L octanoic acid, and 1.7\u00a0 g/L decanoic acid were reached [70]. However, the reverse \u03b2-oxidation is a more energy-efficient pathway compared to the classical biosynthesis of fatty acids. Unlike the fatty acid biosynthesis, where acetyl-CoA is first converted to the elongation unit malonyl-CoA at the cost of one ATP, the reverse \u03b2-oxidation directly uses acetyl-CoA as the elongation unit [9, 18, 38, 50, 58]. The\nreverse \u03b2-oxidation is a cyclical set of four reactions that results in the elongation of an acyl-CoA molecule by two carbon units with each round of the cycle [9] (Fig.\u00a01). It begins with a non-decarboxylative Claisen condensation reaction catalyzed by a thiolase, where acetyl-CoA acts as the donor of two carbon units to an acyl-CoA molecule, generating a \u03b2-ketoacyl-CoA. This is later reduced to a 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA by a \u03b2-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase in a NADH-consuming reaction. The 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA is then dehydrated to an enoyl-CoA by an enoyl-CoA hydratase. Finally, the double bond at the \u03b1-carbon of the enoyl-CoA is reduced at the expense of one NADH molecule by a trans-enoyl-CoA reductase, generating an acyl-CoA molecule. This acyl-CoA molecule is available for a new elongation cycle or can be used by a termination enzyme or a different pathway to produce a wide variety of products like alcohols, acids, polyketides, or volatile esters among others [56].\nIn nature, the reverse \u03b2-oxidation pathway is long known in some Clostridia spp. like C. acetobutylicum, where this pathway is used for the production of butanol [33, 67], or C. kluyveri, where it is used to produce butyric acid and hexanoic acid from ethanol and acetate [3, 48]. Recently, it has also been confirmed in Megasphaera spp. growing on lactic acid, where it produces hexanoic acid [22, 23]. In addition, some reactions and intermediates of the reverse \u03b2-oxidation are also present in other pathways like the polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHA) biosynthesis pathway and the ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway, where thiolase and \u03b2-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase reactions are key steps [44, 68].\nIn S. cerevisiae, the reverse \u03b2-oxidation pathway was first used to produce the four-carbon compound 1-butanol, although at very low titers (2.5\u00a0 mg/L) [54]. Later, the titers of 1-butanol were significantly improved using a trans-enoyl-CoA reductase from Treponema denticola that catalyzes the reduction of enoyl-CoA in an irreversible reaction and by optimizing the NADH and coenzyme A availability, reaching more than 0.85\u00a0 g/L of 1-butanol [49, 50]. Recently, a new variant of the reverse \u03b2-oxidation using the thiolase, BktB, and the \u03b2-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, PaaH1, from Cupriavidus necator proved to be functional in S. cerevisiae to produce hexanoyl-CoA [28], which was used later in this organism as a precursor to synthesize cannabinoids [35]. All in all, the biotechnological application of the reverse \u03b2-oxidation pathway works in S. cerevisiae but seems limited to two cycles, producing only up to C6-intermediates and products. Extending the length of the products from this pathway in an organism so commonly used in industry like S. cerevisiae would accelerate the implementation of sustainable production processes for a previously inaccessible range of products at an industrial scale.\nIn this study, we aimed to increase the number of cycles when expressing the reverse \u03b2-oxidation pathway in the baker\u2019s yeast S. cerevisiae. Free fatty acids are easier to measure and quantify than their coenzyme A bound precursors, and S. cerevisiae already expresses native thioesterases that hydrolyze medium-chain fatty acyl-CoAs into MCFA [4, 11]. Therefore, we used the production of the short-chain fatty acid butyric acid and of mediumchain fatty acids hexanoic acid (caproic acid), octanoic acid (caprylic acid)\u00a0 and decanoic acid (capric acid) to validate any increase in the number of carbon elongation cycles. For this, we first engineered a S. cerevisiae strain with an increased NADH pool, necessary for the successful function of this heterologous pathway, and we studied the effect of deleting the medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthase Faa2 and the peroxisomal acyl-CoA thioesterase Tes1, as both reactions could potentially deplete some of the intermediates required for chain elongation. Then, at the pathway level, we screened different enzymes from various organisms at different steps of the reverse \u03b2-oxidation pathway, some of them known to catalyze reactions required for the pathway, others only with a putative yet unknown function, and we tested different combinations to fine-tune the length of the products (Fig.\u00a01). Finally, we also assessed the influence of the media composition on the MCFA titers."

            "text": "Thiolase BktB is\u00a0crucial for\u00a0medium\u2011chain fatty acid production We constructed a reverse \u03b2-oxidation pathway using Hbd and Crt from C. acetobutylicum as a 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and a crotonase, respectively, and Ter from T. denticola as a trans-2-enoyl-CoA reductase. As a thiolase, we included either Erg10 from S. cerevisiae or BktB from C. necator to compare their effect on the production of longer chain fatty acids. We compared the two thiolases in S. cerevisiae VSY0, a strain lacking the principal alcohol dehydrogenase enzymes (\u2206adh1-5).\nButyric acid, the product of a single cycle of the reverse \u03b2-oxidation pathway, was produced when expressing either the Erg10 pathway variant (GDV098: Erg10, CaHbd, CaCrt, TdTer), or the CnBktB pathway variant (ACBV007: CnBktB, CaHbd, CaCrt, TdTer) (Fig.\u00a0 2). This indicates that the enzymes selected for the reverse \u03b2-oxidation were catalytically active. The Erg10-containing pathway (GDV098) supported the production of 58 \u00b1 11,9\u00a0 mg/L of butyric acid, 47% more than when CnBktB (ACBV007) was the preferred thiolase (39,23 \u00b1 0.71\u00a0mg/L). The presence of CnBktB, on the other hand, slightly increased the production of hexanoic acid (1,07 \u00b1 0,12\u00a0 mg/L), while the overexpression of Erg10 did not. Octanoic and decanoic acid were produced in very low amounts, even without a reverse \u03b2-oxidation pathway, probably by fatty acid synthases in the cytosol and mitochondria [11]. Regarding decanoic acid, we observed an apparent\nincrease in production with both Erg10 and CnBktB, with 0,559 \u00b1 0,090\u00a0mg/L and 0,555 \u00b1 0,052\u00a0mg/L, respectively. Altogether, the overall production of MCFAs was deficient (< 2\u00a0mg/L), regardless of the thiolase used. Nonetheless, we decided to continue with BktB as the thiolase in further experiments as it produced the highest hexanoic acid titers in this experiment and due to the previously reported ability of this enzyme to produce Mediumchain fatty acyl-CoAs.\nProvision of\u00a0more NADH increases reverse \u03b2\u2011oxidation pathway activity The availability of NADH is required for the proper function of the reverse \u03b2-oxidation and the amount required increases for MCFA synthesis due to the higher number of cycles necessary. We observed that in the absence of alcohol dehydrogenases (VSY0: \u2206adh1-5), glycerol production increased to regenerate NAD+ (Additional file\u00a01: Fig. S1). Therefore, we deleted GPD2 encoding the primary glycerol 3-phosphate dehydrogenase to reduce the competition for NADH, generating strain GDY15 (\u2206adh1-5, \u2206gpd2).\nWe compared GDY15 with VSY0, both transformed with an empty vector or ACBV007 (CnBktB, CaHbd, CaCrt, TdTer), and investigated whether the higher availability of NADH could improve the MCFA production by the reverse \u03b2-oxidation pathway (Fig.\u00a03). The deletion of GPD2 (strain GDY15) reduced, on average, the production of glycerol fivefold (Additional file\u00a02: Table\u00a0S1). On\nthe other hand, it doubled the production of butyric acid to 78,2 \u00b1 14,18\u00a0 mg/L (Fig.\u00a0 3A), and hexanoic acid production was increased by 59%, reaching 2,07 \u00b1 0,34\u00a0mg/L (Fig.\u00a0 3B), indicating a higher flux within the reverse \u03b2-oxidation pathway. However, the titers of octanoic and decanoic acid remained very low in all the strains.\nButyric acid was the main product of the pathway also in strain GDY15. This indicates that NADH availability, although pushing the pathway\u2019s activity, is not the only factor limiting the production of longer MCFAs."

            "text": "To determine if the reactions following CnBktB could be limiting the production of MCFA, we first tested two additional NADH-dependent 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenases: PaaH1 from C. necator and the putative YALI0C08811 from Yarrowia lipolytica, which we will refer to as YlHad throughout this study.\nWe transformed GDY15 with the plasmids ACBV007 (CnBktB, CaHbd, CaCrt, TdTer), FHV022 (CnBktB, CnPaaH1, CaCrt, TdTer), GDV151 (CnBktB, YlHad, CaCrt, TdTer) and compared the impact of each 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase on butyric acid (Fig.\u00a0 4A) and MCFA production (Fig.\u00a0 4B). While the variants expressing CaHbd (ACBV007) and YlHad (GDV151) produce mainly butyric acid (89,25 \u00b1 4,03 and 99,2 \u00b1 7,85\u00a0 mg/L, respectively), in the variant expressing CnPaaH1 (FHV022) the\nmain product is hexanoic acid in considerable amounts (32,88 \u00b1 1,09\u00a0mg/L). In this variant, not only the titer of butyric acid (10,35 \u00b1 2,10\u00a0 mg/L) is decreased compared to CaHbd (ACBV007) and YlHad (GDV151), but also the octanoic acid titer (2,68 \u00b1 0.04\u00a0 mg/L) is higher than in those variants (p-value < 0.0001), none of which reached a titer of 1\u00a0mg/L.\nRegarding CaHbd and YlHad, although the butyric acid titers are not significantly different between them, we observed a trend towards higher butyric acid titers with YlHad. Also, while ACBV007 (CaHbd) produced 1,57 \u00b1 0,13\u00a0 mg/L of hexanoic acid, GDV151 (YlHad) did not produce significant amounts of any MCFA.\nThe enoyl\u2011CoA hydratase reaction also\u00a0controls the\u00a0fatty acid chain length The choice of CnPaaH1 as an adequate enzyme at the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase reaction increased the overall MCFA production up to 20-fold. However, the chain length seemed to be limited to hexanoic acid. Therefore, we wanted to test whether the choice of enoylCoA hydratase could also have an impact on the chain length of the MCFA. To assess this, we initially tested one additional enoyl-CoA hydratase, Crt2 from C. necator, first described by [51].\nWe transformed GDY15 with the plasmids FHV018 (CnBktB, CnPaaH1, CnCrt2, TdTer), FHV022 (CnBktB, CnPaaH1, CaCrt, TdTer) or an empty vector (EV) and\ncompared the impact of each enoyl-CoA hydratase on the production of butyric acid and MCFA. The presence of CnCrt2 (FHV018) as enoyl-CoA hydratase did not change the final titers of butyric acid, but it almost doubled the overall production of MCFA compared to when CaCrt (FHV022) was present (Fig.\u00a0 5A, Additional file\u00a0 2: Table\u00a0 S2). The production of octanoic acid increased 15-fold (40,26 \u00b1 1,05\u00a0mg/L). On the other hand, hexanoic acid titers still reached 21,88 \u00b1 0,78\u00a0 mg/L with FHV018 (CnCrt2) but remained lower compared to FHV022\n(CaCrt) (32,88 \u00b1 1,09\u00a0 mg/L). Although still at relatively low titers, decanoic acid increased twofold in the presence of CnCrt2.\nAnalysis in PROSITE showed that CnCrt2 has an amino acid signature (PS00166) typically found in the enoyl-CoA hydratase/isomerase family [7]. We screened for enzymes with this motif in S. cerevisiae and some known oleaginous yeast [30] and performed a Protein BLAST of the best candidates against CnCrt2. As a result, YALI0B10406p, a putative mitochondrial enoyl-CoA hydratase from Y. lipolytica which will be referred to as YlECH throughout this study, resulted as the most promising candidate and was tested for MCFA production as plasmid GDV144 (CnBktB, CnPaaH1, YlECH, TdTer). When expressing this pathway variant, titers of hexanoic acid and octanoic acid reached 26,57 \u00b1 0,39\u00a0 mg/L and 41,66 \u00b1 3,81\u00a0 mg/L, respectively. Compared to FHV018 (CnCrt2), the GDV144 (YlECH) variant produced higher titers of hexanoic acid; therefore, the hexanoic acid to octanoic acid ratio increased almost 20% in this strain. No significant changes in butyric acid production were observed in this strain compared to FHV018 (CnCrt2) or FHV022 (CaCrt), and the production of decanoic acid was also not improved.\nWe also observed that the final OD600nm decreased with hexanoic acid production (FHV022) and decreased further with octanoic as the main product (FHV018 and GDV144), suggesting a growth inhibitory effect proportional to the chain length of the main fatty acid produced\n(Fig.\u00a0 5B). In addition, we observed that, in the octanoic acid producing variants, the expression of YlECH (GDV144) results in a slight growth impairment compared to CnCrt2 (FHV018).\nThe selection of\u00a0an\u00a0appropriate trans\u2011enoyl\u2011CoA reductase determines the\u00a0product titers The trans-enoyl-CoA reductase reaction was a bottleneck in the reverse \u03b2-oxidation pathway when producing n-butanol [49]. Therefore, we tested one additional trans-enoyl-CoA reductase from the microalgae Euglena gracilis, which will be referred to as EgTer, lacking its mitochondrial targeting sequence. This enzyme was first described by Inui et\u00a0al. [20] as part of a mitochondrial form of anaerobic fatty acid synthesis in E. gracilis, and later characterized by Hoffmeister et\u00a0 al. [19]. EgTer has a reported higher specificity for trans-2-hexenoylCoA and trans-2-octenoyl-CoA than for crotonoyl-CoA [20], which makes it a suitable candidate to improve the MCFA production.\nWe transformed GDY15 with the plasmid GDV116 (CnBktB, CnPaaH1, CnCrt2, EgTer) and compared the production of butyric acid and MCFA against FHV018 (CnBktB, CnPaaH1, CnCrt2, TdTer) and an empty vector control after 75\u00a0 h of fermentation in SM medium. The production pattern did not change, with octanoic acid as the main MCFA with both trans-enoyl-CoA reductases, followed by hexanoic acid (Fig.\u00a0 6A). However, the expression of EgTer (GDV116) significantly decreased the overall\nproduction of MCFA (45,57 \u00b1 1,59\u00a0 mg/L) compared to TdTer (FHV018) (54,89 \u00b1 1,89\u00a0mg/L). Butyric acid production did not significantly differ between trans-enoyl-CoA reductases, although we also see a trend of lower titers with EgTer (GDV116).The production of significant titers of MCFA results, again, in impaired growth compared to the empty vector control (Fig.\u00a06B). However, the growth with both plasmids FHV018 and GDV116 is similar, suggesting that the higher MCFA production by FHV018 (TdTer) is not growth-related,but that TdTer is a better enzyme for this reaction. When we compare the MCFA yield on biomass (YMCFA/X) and the yield on glucose (YMCFA/S) (Additional file\u00a0 2: Table\u00a0 S3) of each clone, we observed that GDY15 expressing TdTer as trans-2-enoylCoA reductase had a 40% and 54% higher yield on biomass and glucose, respectively, compared to EgTer.\nFinally, the yield of glycerol on biomass (YGLY/X) and on glucose (YGLY/S) was higher with EgTer (GDV116), 13% and 40% respectively, than with TdTer (FHV018). This might indicate that NADH re-oxidation via the EgTercontaining pathway variant was insufficient, leading to increased glycerol production through the remaining Gpd1."

            "text": "Competing reactions could still hinder the production of MCFAs. To increase the production of free MCFA, we deleted TES1 or FAA2 in strain GDY15, generating strains GDY16 (\u2206adh1-5, \u2206gpd2, \u2206tes1) and GDY19 (\u2206adh1-5, \u2206gpd2, \u2206faa2). However, deleting these genes did not significantly increase MCFA nor reduce butyric acid titers or yields compared to their parental GDY15 strain (Fig.\u00a07, Additional file\u00a02: Table\u00a0S4).\nIncreasing butyryl\u2011CoA availability boosts hexanoic acid production Butyryl-CoA is the product of a single cycle of the reverse \u03b2-oxidation pathway. It is key to producing hexanoylCoA, a precursor of hexanoic acid that can be further elongated to octanoyl-CoA, precursor of octanoic acid. Therefore, we tested whether increasing the first round of the reverse \u03b2-oxidation pathway could further improve MCFA production. In GDY15 we combined GDV124 (CnBktB, CnPaaH1, CnCrt2, TdTer) with GDV098 (Erg10, CaHbd, CaCrt, TdTer) or an empty vector (EV) control.\nThe addition of a butyryl-CoA producing pathway increased butyric acid titers almost threefold (GDV098 + GDV124) (37,79 \u00b1 0,61\u00a0 mg/L) compared to when the MCFA producing pathway operates alone (EVURA + GDV124) (13,09 \u00b1 0,93\u00a0 mg/L) (Fig.\u00a0 8A). Hexanoic acid production also increased 23% when expressing\nGDV098 (31,04 \u00b1 0,96\u00a0 mg/L), probably due to higher availability of butyryl-CoA. However, neither octanoic nor decanoic acid titers changed significantly with the additional expression of the butyryl-CoA producing. No significant butyric acid or MCFA were detected in the absence of any reverse \u03b2-oxidation pathway variant.\nAs observed in previous experiments, the growth of the MCFAs-producing strains was impaired compared to that of the non-producing strains (Fig.\u00a08B). Interestingly, the higher butyric acid production in the strain expressing both GDV098 and GDV124 did not compromise the growth compared to the strain only expressing the MCFA-producing pathway.\nFermentation medium and\u00a0buffering effect determines MCFA production As observed above, an increased chain length in MCFAs decreased growth. In addition, strategies to increase the chain length improved hexanoic acid yield on biomass (YHEX/X), but not those of octanoic (YOCT/X) or decanoic acid (YDEC/X) (Additional file\u00a02: Table\u00a0S5). We compared growth and MCFA production in buffered synthetic medium (SM) against an equally buffered (20\u00a0 mM phosphate) YPD medium to test whether these limitations arise from the medium composition used during\nfermentations. In addition, we also tested if an increased buffering capacity could improve MCFA production. For that, we also tested YPD with 100\u00a0 mM phosphate concentration (YPD-100\u00a0 mM). Since no auxotrophic markers can be used in YPD and to avoid the addition of antibiotics to the fermentation medium, we genomically integrated the hexanoic acid (with CaCrt) and the octanoic acid (with CnCrt2 or YlECH) producing pathway cassettes in strain GDY15, generating strains GDY27 (CaCrt), GDY28 (CnCrt2) and GDY29 (YlECH). We fermented GDY15 and the producing strains in different media up to 75\u00a0 h and compared MCFA and butyric acid production after 50\u00a0h and 75\u00a0h.\nOverall, the production titers of butyric acid, hexanoic acid and octanoic acid peaked at 50\u00a0 h in the three different fermentation media tested (Fig.\u00a0 9). Also, production titers were higher in YPD-based medium than in SM and increased further with increased buffering. This pattern was observed in all the strains except for GDY15 (Fig.\u00a09A). In this strain, there was no butyric acid production and all MCFA were produced at titers below 2\u00a0mg/L.\nAfter 50\u00a0 h in YPD-20\u00a0 mM, the butyric acid, hexanoic acid and octanoic acid production titers in GDY27 (Fig.\u00a0 9B) reached 46,97 \u00b1 3,71\u00a0 mg/L, 62,17 \u00b1 0,6\u00a0 mg/L and 4,27 \u00b1 0,04\u00a0 mg/L, respectively, representing a 75%, 35% and 45% increase compared to titers in SM.\nButyric and hexanoic acid titers were further increased in YPD-100\u00a0 mM, reaching 64,74 \u00b1 3,57\u00a0 mg/L and 74,58 \u00b1 0,39\u00a0 mg/L, respectively. In the case of hexanoic acid and to our knowledge, these are the highest titers produced in S. cerevisiae using the reverse \u03b2-oxidation pathway. In this strain, octanoic acid titers were slightly reduced (3,29 \u00b1 0,21\u00a0mg/L) in YPD-100\u00a0mM.\nIn the octanoic acid producing strains, GDY28 and GDY29, octanoic acid production increased by 36% in GDY28 (43,04 \u00b1 0,28\u00a0 mg/L) and by 50% in GDY29 (47,98 \u00b1 0,15\u00a0 mg/L) in YPD-20\u00a0 mM compared to SM (Fig.\u00a0 9C, D). In these two strains, butyric acid and hexanoic acid increased in YPD-20\u00a0 mM by 30%, on average, compared to fermentation in SM, with butyric acid and hexanoic acid reaching 26,31 \u00b1 4,31\u00a0 mg/L and 42,53 \u00b1 0,93\u00a0 mg/L in GDY28, respectively, and 31,03 \u00b1 3,38\u00a0 mg/L (butyric acid) and 42,92 \u00b1 3,23\u00a0 mg/L (hexanoic acid) in GDY29. As in the case of GDY27, the titers of butyric, hexanoic and octanoic acid increased in both strains when cultivated in the more buffered YPD100\u00a0 mM medium. Here, butyric acid and hexanoic acid titers reached 38,75 \u00b1 2,22\u00a0 mg/L and 60.23 \u00b1 0.78\u00a0 mg/L in GDY28, respectively, and 38,46 \u00b1 2,65\u00a0 mg/L and 61.67 \u00b1 1.71\u00a0 mg/L in GDY29. Regarding the production of octanoic acid by these two strains in YPD100\u00a0mM, we produced 56.88 \u00b1 0.41\u00a0mg/L in GDY28 and\n58.31 \u00b1 1.06\u00a0mg/L in GDY29, a 30% and a 20% improvement to the octanoic acid titers observed in YPD-20\u00a0mM and, to our knowledge, the highest titers of octanoic acid produced in yeast via the reverse \u03b2-oxidation.\nAfter 75\u00a0 h of fermentation, we observed a slight decrease in the final titers of butyric acid, hexanoic acid and octanoic acid in all strains. Interestingly, the only exception was GDY27, where hexanoic acid was almost completely consumed after 75\u00a0h in YPD-100\u00a0mM (7,51 \u00b1 2.23\u00a0mg/L) (Fig.\u00a09B). We observed this phenomenon only in this strain and in separate experiments when cultivated in YPD-100\u00a0mM (data not shown). The composition of the fermentation medium and the phosphate buffer concentration also significantly influenced the growth of different strains, their metabolite consumption and production pattern (Fig.\u00a0 10, Additional file\u00a0 1: Fig. S2, S3, Additional file\u00a0 2: Table\u00a0 S6). While in SM glucose was never completely consumed in any of the strains, switching to YPD-20\u00a0mM increased the overall glucose consumption of the strain by 60% and led to glucose being depleted from the fermentation medium in GDY15 and GDY27 already after 50\u00a0 h, and in GDY28 and GDY29 after 75\u00a0 h. Fermentation in YPD-20\u00a0 mM also more than doubled\n(A) (B)\n(2.4-fold) the final OD600nm of the control strain GDY15 (Fig.\u00a0 10A), increased it by 80% for GDY27 (Fig.\u00a0 10B) and by 46% in both octanoic acid producers compared to fermentation in SM (Fig.\u00a010C, D).\nFurther increasing the buffering capacity of the medium (YPD-100\u00a0mM) resulted in the total consumption of glucose after 50\u00a0 h of fermentation in all the strains (Additional file\u00a01: Fig. S2). Fermentation in YPD-100\u00a0mM also boosted the growth of all strains (except for GDY15), which was particularly noticeable in strain GDY27, where the final OD600nm increased by 87% compared to when grown in YPD-20\u00a0 mM. In the case of the octanoic acid producing strains GDY28 and GDY29, final OD600nm increased by 25% and 28%, respectively, compared to those in YPD-20\u00a0mM."

            "text": "In this study, we modified the ethanol, glycerol and redox metabolism of a S. cerevisiae strain and identified optimal combinations of enzymes to produce butyric, hexanoic, and octanoic acid via different variants of a reverse \u03b2-oxidation pathway.\nWe generated a strain with blocked competing pathways and an increased NADH availability, a co-factor required by the heterologous pathway. This strategy was previously successful both in E. coli and S. cerevisiae, where deletion of main NADH consuming pathways led to an increased production of n-butanol or hexanol [49, 52]. We observed that our initial strain VSY0 (\u2206adh1-5) produced significant glycerol titers (Additional file\u00a01: Fig. S1A). In S. cerevisiae, glycerol production starts with an\n(A)\n(B)\nNADH-consuming reduction of dihydroxyacetone phosphate to glycerol 3-phosphate [42], catalyzed by Gpd2 to prevent NADH accumulation in anaerobic conditions [1, 2]. Therefore, we knocked out GPD2 to avoid this NADH pool being used for the formation of glycerol. This led to an increased productivity of the reverse \u03b2-oxidation pathway (Fig.\u00a0 3). Similar strategies consisting of deleting both GPD1 and GPD2 genes to prevent competition for NADH have resulted in increased final titers of isobutanol [64].\nWe identified specific combinations of enzymes optimal for butyric, hexanoic and octanoic acid production. The presence of Erg10, CaHbd or YlHad limited the production to butyric acid. The thiolase, Erg10, catalyzes the formation of acetoacetyl-CoA from two acetyl-CoA molecules in the mevalonate pathway, critical for the formation of isoprenoids in eukaryotes [17]. Erg10 was previously selected as the best thiolase to produce 1-butanol in S. cerevisiae [50]. However, no MCFAs titers were determined in that study. Here, we show that its thiolase activity is limited to the condensation of two acetyl-CoA molecules. CaHbd is part of the conserved 1-butanol production pathway found in different clostridia species [33] and, therefore, specific towards the 4-carbon long 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA. Surprisingly, a pathway with CaHbd was reported to produce up to 101\u00a0mg/mL of hexanoic acid in K. marxianus grown in YPD [5]. However, in S. cerevisiae our main product was butyric acid. YlHad is a putative mitochondrial 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase from Y. lipolytica [60]. To the best of our knowledge, YlHad had only been tested once to produce butanol and MCFA in S. cerevisiae [34] where it produced up to 8\u00a0 mg/mL of octanoic acid. However, we did not detect significant titers of products longer than butyric acid with this enzyme in our study. A possible explanation for this difference might be the impact of the medium-chain specific thioesterase (FatB1 from Candida parapsilosis) used in the experiment by Lian and Zhao [34].\nThe presence of CnBktB and CnPaaH1 was critical for producing hexanoic and octanoic acid. We selected CnBktB because it has been reported to catalyze the condensation of acetyl-CoA with butyryl-CoA or hexanoyl-CoA [6, 8, 35], and we confirmed this by producing hexanoic and octanoic acid. In the specific case of acetyl-CoA condensation with hexanoyl-CoA, we observed this activity for the first time in S. cerevisiae. In the screening, we included CnPaaH1, a 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase with a reported crystal structure (PDB:4PZC) [24], because of its known affinity for 3-oxohexanoyl-CoAs [28, 36]. Here, we show for the first time that, besides reducing 3-oxohexanoyl-CoA, it can also catalyze the reduction of 3-oxooctanoyl-CoA that leads to the production of octanoic acid.\nSelecting an adequate enoyl-CoA hydratase was essential to tune the pattern of MCFAs produced. Our study shows that both CnCrt2 and YlECH are suitable enoylCoA hydratases for producing MCFAs up to octanoic acid. Based on previous studies, the substrate preference of YlECH was limited to 3-hydroxybutyryl-CoA when used in a modified reverse \u03b2-oxidation pathway in S. cerevisiae [34]. In the case of CnCrt2, its activity on 3-hydroxyhexanoyl-CoA was known after its overexpression in a modified C. necator strain increased the production of poly((R)-3-hydroxybutyrate-co-(R)-3-hydroxyhexanoate), a polymer made partially of hexanoyl-CoA [68]. Here, we show for the first time that YlECH can also use 3-hydroxyhexanoyl-CoA as substrate, and that both enzymes can use 3-hydroxyoctanoyl-CoA, leading to octanoic acid as the main product. The clostridial CaCrt limited the production to hexanoic acid, confirming its previously observed activity towards 3-hydroxyhexanoyl-CoA, which has been exploited to produce hexanoyl-CoA, a key precursor for cannabinoid synthesis [35, 55, 57] and also to produce hexanoic acid in E. coli [59]. Since under the same conditions no significant octanoic or decanoic acids were produced in the presence of CaCrt compared to CnCrt2 or YlECH, this suggests that CaCrt has no affinity towards 3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs longer than 6-carbons.\nThe enzyme variants selected for the reactions preceding the enoyl-CoA reductase seem to limit the production to octanoic acid, as no relevant titers of decanoic acid were obtained. This hampered a comparison between the activities towards longer chain substrates of the trans-enoyl-2-CoA reductases tested (EgTer or TdTer). However, we observed a higher yield of MCFA production when TdTer was present, suggesting a higher catalytic activity with this enzyme under the conditions tested.\nTo discard the possibility of CnBktB cleaving decanoylCoA, given that the condensation reaction catalyzed by thiolases is only thermodynamically favored at high substrate concentrations [9], we tested the co-expression of a MCFA producing pathway variant with a butyrylCoA producing pathway to boost MCFA. With this, we expected to increase the concentrations of medium chain acyl-CoAs upstream to decanoyl-CoA. However, this only led to butyric acid as the main product and only increased hexanoic acid titers (Fig.\u00a08A). In a previous work by Kim and Gonzalez [26], the combination of CnBktB with EgTer, two enzymes also used in our study, led to titers close to 100\u00a0mg/L of decanoic acid in E. coli [26]. However, a dual 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase/ enoyl-CoA hydratase (fadB) was used in that study, and it is possible that the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and enoyl-CoA hydratases combinations used in our study have no affinity for 10-carbon 3-hydroxyacyl-CoAs or 3-oxoacyl-CoAs.\nWe also tested the deletions of endogenous thioesterase TES1 and medium chain acyl-CoA synthase FAA2 to prevent the produced MCFA being consumed via \u03b2-oxidation. The short-chain acyl-CoA thioesterases Tes1 is known to target butyryl-CoA in S. cerevisiae [37]. This could lead to an increased butyric acid production that would compromise the chain elongation capacity of the pathway. Faa2, on the other hand, is a medium-chain fatty acyl-CoA synthetase that activates medium-chain free fatty acids in the peroxisomes, where they diffuse, and this leads to their degradation via \u03b2-oxidation [31]. Nonetheless, we did not observe any significant change in titers or the pattern of MCFA production in either case (Fig.\u00a0 7). Tes1 is located in the peroxisomes of S. cerevisiae, while the reverse \u03b2-oxidation enzymes were expressed in the cytosol, making the impact of its deletion harder to assess due to pre-existing limited access of this thioesterase to the acyl-CoA intermediates of the pathway. As a comparison, in E. coli the deletion of TesB, a cytosolic thioesterase closely related to Tes1 [21, 37], led to a significant increase in the C6-C10 MCFA fraction produced by the expression of the reverse \u03b2-oxidation in the cytosol of this organism [25]. Regarding Faa2, while the deletion of FAA2 is reported to increase the production of medium-chain fatty acids [31] and medium-chain fatty alcohols in S. cerevisiae [16], it had no impact on MCFA titers under the conditions tested in this study.\nWe initially screened the different combinations of genes for the reverse \u03b2-oxidation on centromeric plasmids. However, we observed increased titers\u00a0upon integrating the best enzyme combinations in the genome (Fig.\u00a05 and Fig.\u00a09). Improved expression after genomic integration has been observed previously in S. cerevisiae [49, 50]. It could be explained by a lower plasmid burden, particularly when using big (> 10\u00a0 kb) plasmids like the ones in this study, but also by the higher expression variability between cells observed when heterologous genes are expressed from plasmids compared to when expressed from the genome [32]. Besides chromosomal integration, the composition of the fermentation medium also played an essential role in the titers obtained, as we achieved the highest titers of MCFA in YPD with 100\u00a0mM phosphate buffer at pH 6.3 (Fig.\u00a09). Increasing the buffering capacity in the medium for MCFA production was previously effective in S. cerevisiae strains engineered to produce octanoic acid via a modified FAS enzyme [4, 11]. We hypothesize that increasing buffering capacity at pH 6.3 prevents the anionic forms of butyric, hexanoic and octanoic acid (pKa\u2019s around 4.8\u20134.9) to re-enter the cell through passive diffusion. This way, the cell only has to metabolize the intracellularly produced MCFAs, where a portion of\nthem will not be charged due to a lower cytosolic pH than the medium [46], and could therefore exit the cell by passive diffusion. The remaining cytosolic charged fraction of the MCFAs should be either consumed in the \u03b2-oxidation or possibly secreted via Pdr12, an ABC transporter involved in the adaptation to weak acid stress in yeast [45].\nThis study aimed to extend the chain length of MCFA produced in S. cerevisiae via reverse \u03b2-oxidation further than hexanoic acid. We identified new enzyme combinations to produce octanoic acid in S. cerevisiae. However, the 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase and enoyl-CoA hydratases selected here seem to limit further elongation of the products. Furthermore, butyric acid was present in both hexanoic acid and octanoic acid-producing strains, but this might be derived from the reaction of the endogenous Erg10 and additionally CnBktB. Recently, Vogeli et\u00a0 al. [59] reported high titers of hexanoic acid with minimal amounts of butyric acid as a side product in a modified E. coli strain combining a thiolase, ThlA, and a 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, Hbd, from C. autoethanogenum with CaCrt and TdTer. In that study, butyric acid titers were further reduced by overexpressing putative C6-C10 specific thioesterase TesA. Even though a different organism and a different hydroxybutyryl-CoA dehydrogenase was used in their study, further investigation on alternative reverse \u03b2-oxidation enzymes and thioesterases is needed to improve product specificity in S. cerevisiae. In addition, octanoic acid titers are below those reported by engineering FAS [11] and both pathways seem to be limited by the toxicity of their products. Therefore, preventing toxicity is the next goal towards industrial MCFA production."

The expression of this pathway in this yeast had previously resulted in the production of only up to 6-carbon products. To extend the number of cycles of this pathway in this organism, we tackled competing reactions by deleting GPD2 and then separately FAA2 and TES1. However, only the deletion of GPD2 resulted in increasing titers. We also studied the effect of different enzymes in different steps of the pathway and established a reverse \u03b2-oxidation pathway that resulted in the production of octanoic acid as the main product. Furthermore, we showed for the first time that Crt2 from C. necator and the putative enoyl-CoA hydratase ECH from Y. lipolytica prefer 8-carbon long enoyl-CoA over shorter molecules. Finally, our results also show that production is correlated to the buffering\ncapacity of the fermentation medium, which suggests that product toxicity is an issue to be tackled if MCFA are to be produced at higher titers using the reverse \u03b2-oxidation."

For FAA2 deletion, the plasmid pRCCK_SH06 was co-transformed with a PCR amplified FAA2 region of a \u2206faa2-ko strain (SHY34), which was used as donor DNA. The crRNAs required for recognition by the Cas9 endonucleases in FHV016, pRCCK_GD01 and pRCCK_SH06 were designed using the gRNA designer online tool from ATUM (https:// www. atum. bio/ catal og/ vecto rs/ grnadesign). Strains GDY27, GDY28, GDY29 derive from the integration of the respective expression cassettes from plasmids GDV149, GDV143, and GDV150 in strain GDY15. The integration cassettes were first linearized by an overnight digestion with NotI, the restriction enzyme was then deactivated and the whole digestion reaction was transformed in GDY15. The linearized integration cassettes contained 500\u00a0bp homologous regions upstream and downstream of the URA3 loci. Yeast transformations were performed according to [13]. Positive clones were selected on YPD-agar plates with 200\u00a0\u00b5g/mL Geneticin. All deletions were confirmed by PCR."

Then, 200\u00a0 \u00b5g of heptanoic acid were added as internal standard to 10\u00a0 mL of each supernatant and mixed with 1\u00a0mL of a 1\u00a0M HCl and 2.5\u00a0mL of a methanol/chloroform solution (1:1). The solution was vigorously shaken for 5\u00a0min and then centrifuged (3000 rcf, 10\u00a0min, RT). The chloroform fraction was transferred to a 1.5\u00a0mL Eppendorf tube and evaporated overnight.\nFor fatty acid methylation, both the samples from the FFA extraction and standard samples containing 5, 25, 50, 100 and 200\u00a0mg/L of hexanoic, octanoic and decanoic acid (Sigma\u2013Aldrich) were dissolved in 200\u00a0\u00b5L of toluene, mixed with 1.5\u00a0 mL of methanol and 300\u00a0 \u00b5L of an 8.0% (w/v) HCl solution, vortexed vigorously and incubated at\n100\u00a0\u00b0C for 3\u00a0h to generate fatty acid methyl ester (FAME). Then, samples were cooled at 4\u00a0\u00b0C for 15\u00a0min and 1\u00a0mL of water and 1\u00a0mL hexane were added. The mixture was briefly shaken in a vortex and after a clear separation of the organic and aqueous phase, the organic phase was transferred to a GC vial.\nFatty acid methyl esters analysis in\u00a0GC\u2011FID GC analyses for detection and quantification of MCFA were carried out on a Perkin Elmer Clarus 400 instrument (Perkin Elmer, Germany) equipped with an Elite 5MS capillary column (30\u00a0m \u00d7 0.25\u00a0mm, film thickness 1.00\u00a0 \u00b5m, Perkin Elmer, Germany) and a flame ionization detector (Perkin Elmer, Germany). 1\u00a0\u03bcL of the sample was analyzed after split injection (1:10) and helium was used as carrier gas (90\u00a0 kPa). For quantification of FAMEs, the temperatures of the injector and detector were 250 and 300\u00a0 \u00b0C, respectively. The following temperature program was used: 50\u00a0 \u00b0C for 5\u00a0 min; increase of 10\u00a0\u00b0C/min to 120\u00a0\u00b0C and hold for 5\u00a0min; increase of 15\u00a0 \u00b0C/min to 220\u00a0 \u00b0C and hold for 10\u00a0 min; increase of 20\u00a0\u00b0C/min to 300\u00a0\u00b0C and hold for 5\u00a0min. Medium-chain FAMEs were identified and quantified by comparison to FAMEs in standard samples."
