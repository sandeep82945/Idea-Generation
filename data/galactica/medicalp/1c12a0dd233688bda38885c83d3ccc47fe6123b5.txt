Glioblastoma (GBM) is an aggressive and incurable primary brain tumor that harbors therapy-resistant cancer stem cells (CSCs). Due to the limited effectiveness of conventional chemotherapies and radiation treatments against CSCs, there is a critical need for the development of innovative therapeutic approaches. Our previous research revealed the significant expression of embryonic stemness genes, NANOG and OCT4, in CSCs, suggesting their role in enhancing cancer-specific stemness and drug resistance. In our current study, we employed RNA interference (RNAi) to suppress the expression of these genes and observed an increased susceptibility of CSCs to the anticancer drug, temozolomide (TMZ). Suppression of NANOG expression induced cell cycle arrest in CSCs, specifically in the G0 phase, and it concomitantly decreased the expression of PDK1. Since PDK1 activates the PI3K/AKT pathway to promote cell proliferation and survival, our findings suggest that NANOG contributes to chemotherapy resistance in CSCs through PI3K/AKT pathway activation. Therefore, the combination of TMZ treatment with RNAi targeting NANOG holds promise as a therapeutic strategy for GBM. 1. conclusions Extensive research on CSCs has been conducted in the field of cancer research, as they share many characteristics with normal stem cells, although their origin is unclear. To achieve a successful treatment for cancers such as GBM, it is essential to develop therapies that can effectively target and eliminate CSCs. Embryonic stem cell genes play a pivotal role in regulating the stem-like properties of CSCs and contribute significantly to therapeutic resistance. Our study demonstrated that suppressing the expression of stem cell genes NANOG and OCT4 can enhance the effectiveness of TMZ treatment in CSCs derived from GBM. Our findings suggest that this improvement may be attributed to the downregulation of the PDK1 gene by NANOG suppression, resulting in reduced AKT phosphorylation within the PI3K/AKT pathway. Consequently, this may lead to G0/G1 cell cycle arrest and increased susceptibility to chemotherapy. These results provide a foundation for

considering NANOG and OCT4 as viable gene targets for GBM treatment. Notably, these factors are not expressed in adult cells, allowing for the selective targeting of CSCs without side effects. The use of shRNA to suppress these embryonic stem cell genes combined with existing treatment strategies holds great potential for clinical applications to improve patient outcomes significantly.
