"Government subsidies should be considered in this case." 

"Subsidizing green consumers is more beneficial to the green developer’s profits and subsidizing the green developer is more conducive to improving the carbon emission reduction in green housing."

"When subsidizing the developer of green housing, the effect of different subsidies depends on the cost structure. Subsidizing the main costs of a green developer has lower subsidy effectiveness."

"Government subsidies can increase the market share of green housing. When consumers are subsidized, the price of green housing is higher than that without subsidies. When the green developer is subsidized for its costs, the price of green homes is lower than that without subsidies."

"Subsidizing green consumers and subsidizing green costs can improve the carbon emission reduction in green standards."

"Subsidizing green consumers is more conducive to increasing GD’s profits with the same subsidy amount."

"Subsidizing GD is more conducive to improving the carbon emission reductions in green housing."

"A mixed policy of subsidized green incremental cost and green standards should be implemented when the green incremental cost is low and a single policy of subsidizing the basic cost should be implemented when the green incremental cost is high."
