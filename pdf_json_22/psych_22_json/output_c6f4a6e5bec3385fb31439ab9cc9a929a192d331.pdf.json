Durability can be further split into temporal stability and pliability (or persistence and resistance), while impact can be further split into effects of the attitude on behaviour and the processing of attitude-relevant information. Temporal stability and impact on behaviour are the defining features of attitude strength that have received the most attention (Krosnick & Petty, 1995), and\nThis is an open access article under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License, which permits use and distribution in any medium, provided the original work is properly cited, the use is non-commercial and nomodifications or adaptations aremade. \u00a9 2022 The Authors.

These two features of strong attitudes are not unrelated, with attitude temporal stability being one important mechanism through which strong attitudes better predict behaviour (the prediction explanation; Fabrigar et al., 2005). As Schwartz (1978) noted, attitudes likely will not predict subsequent behaviour unless they persist over the intervening time interval between when the two are measured. A number of predictors of attitude strength have been identified. For example, Howe and Krosnick (2017) identified 11 \u2018attitude features\u2019 related to strength: certainty, importance, ambivalence, accessibility, knowledge volume, extremity, cognitive-affective\n656 wileyonlinelibrary.com/journal/ejsp Eur J Soc Psychol. 2022;52:656\u2013668.\nest, W iley O nline L ibrary on [10/11/2022].

Similarly, Luttrell and Sawicki (2020) identified seven \u2018predictors\u2019 (the term used here) of attitude strength: accessibility, ambivalence, certainty, importance, elaboration, knowledge, andmoralization. Although there is good evidence supporting each of these predictors, there are few studies that attempt to assess their individual and simultaneous effects on the defining features of attitude strength within a single study in the same sample. The current study aimed to help fill this gap by assessing attitude certainty, attitude importance, attitude subjective knowledge,moral basis of attitude, attitude elaboration, and three measures of correspondence between cognitive and affective attitudes (felt ambivalence, potential ambivalence, and inconsistency) as important predictors of attitude strength that might be expected to impact on attitude stability andmoderate the attitude T1\u2013behaviour T2 relationship in a single study. In addition, this study assessed the extent to which the effects of these predictors of attitude strength on moderating the attitude\u2013behaviour relationship could be accounted for by their impact on attitude stability. Finally, the present research tested these effects within individuals across a set of behaviours, rather than across individuals with a single behaviour."

            "text": "Three aspects of perceptions of the attitude have been commonly used as predictors of attitude strength: attitude certainty, attitude importance, and moral basis of attitude. Attitude certainty refers to the degree of confidence an individual has that his or her evaluation of the attitude object is correct/clear to him or her. The conviction with which an attitude is held is included as part of other definitions of certainty (Tormala & Rucker, 2018). Simple single-item, meta-judgmental (Bassili, 1996) measures are often used to tap certainty (e.g., Fazio & Zanna, 1978) and studies have shown greater certainty to be linked to both greater stability of attitudes (Bassili, 1996) and stronger attitude\u2013 behaviour relationships (Fazio & Zanna, 1978; Warland & Sample, 1973). Cooke and Sheeran (2004) found significant effects of certainty on attitude\u2013behaviour relationships across four studies with a small\u2013 mediummagnitude average effect size.\nAttitude importance is the degree to which an individual attaches significance to the attitude object. This is a predictor of attitude strength that has received considerable attention (e.g., it is the focus of the first Annual Review of Psychology article focusing on attitude strength; Howe & Krosnick, 2017). These authors suggest that attitude importance is a key predictor of attitude strength and reflects the\ndegree of priority a person attaches to an attitude and distinguishes it from concepts that link an attitude to one\u2019s values or self-image (e.g., centrality, involvement, ego-involvement, salience, personal relevance). The most frequently used measures of this construct tap how important the attitude or object is to the individual, how concerned they are about it, or how deeply they care about it (i.e., metajudgmentalmeasures; Gopinath&Neyer, 2009; Krosnick, 1989). A limited number of studies show greater attitude importance to be associated with stronger attitude\u2013behaviour relationships in relation to product choices (Kokkinaki & Lunt, 1997), work behaviour (Ziegler & Schlett, 2016), and environmental behaviours (Bolson, 2013). There are fewer tests of the impact of attitude importance on attitude stability (Krosnick, 1988).\nMoral basis of attitude is the degree to which an attitude is a strong and absolute belief that something is right or wrong or moral or immoral, or that it reflects coremoral values and convictions (Skitka, 2014). It is measured by meta-judgmental measures and studies have shown such attitudes to bemore stable (Luttrell &Togans, 2021) and to better predict behaviour (Judge et al., 2012; Skitka & Bauman, 2008)."

            "heading": "2.2 Attitude-related knowledge/thought",
            "text": "Two aspects of attitude-related knowledge/thought have been commonly used as predictors of attitudes strength: attitude knowledge and attitude elaboration. Attitude knowledge refers to the amount of information the person has about the attitude object. This is usually tapped by knowledge listing tasks or quizzes (i.e., operative indexes; Bassili, 1996), although meta-judgmental measures (labelled attitude subjective knowledge here) have also been used. For example, Davidson et al. (1985) asked respondents about how well-informed they were about the attitude object (completely uninformed\u2014completely informed). Davidson et al. (1985) showed greater knowledge to be associated with stronger attitude\u2013behaviour relationships and studies have also shown it to be linked to greater attitude stability (Bartle, 2000). Attitude elaboration is the degree of thought or careful consideration one has given to the attitude object\u2019s merits and shortcomings (Barden&Tormala, 2014). The classicmeasure is based on thought listing where participants list all their thoughts about an attitude object (i.e., operative measures; Petty & Cacioppo, 1977), although metajudgmental measures of elaboration could be tapped by simple selfreport. Studies have shown more elaborated attitudes to be more stable (Haugtvedt & Petty, 1992) and to better predict behaviour (Barden & Petty, 2008)."

Greater ambivalence is generally associated with less stable attitudes and weaker attitude\u2013 behaviour relationships. Cooke and Sheeran (2004) reported a significant effect of ambivalence on the attitude\u2013behaviour relationship across six studies, although the average effect size was small. It is possible to distinguishmeasures of ambivalence along a number of dimensions. These include the nature of the differently valenced evaluations (e.g., overall, cognitive, affective, cognitive-affective) and whether the measure is meta-judgmental or operative (Conner & Sparks, 2002). Felt ambivalence focuses on meta-judgmental awareness of difference between positive and negative evaluations and is tapped by self-report measures (Conner & Sparks, 2002). In contrast, potential ambivalence directly measures the positive and negative evaluations of an attitude object and combines them (Conner & Sparks, 2002; Thompson et al., 1995) into anoperativemeasureof ambivalence. Previous researchhas shown measures of felt ambivalence to be less consistent moderators of attitude stability and attitude\u2013behaviour relationships compared to operative measures of ambivalence (Conner & Armitage, 2008). This may be because felt ambivalence can prompt a re-evaluation of attitudes and even behaviour (van Harreveld et al., 2009).\nIn relation to cognitive and affective components of attitudes (the focus here), felt ambivalence refers to perceived differences between cognitive and affective attitudes, while potential ambivalence refers to cognitive and affective evaluations of an attitude object that are oppositely valenced (Conneret al., 2021). Relatedly, cognitive-affective inconsistency is the absolute difference between the cognitive and affective evaluations of an attitude object (irrespective of whether these evaluations are oppositely valenced or not). Conner et al. (2021) found that a measure of (cognitive-affective) inconsistency, derived from bipolar measures of cognitive and affective attitudes, moderated the attitude\u2013behaviour relationship, and was a stronger moderator than (cognitive-affective) potential ambivalence. Higher levels of (cognitive-affective) potential ambivalence and inconsistency were both associated with weaker attitude\u2013behaviour relationships (Conner et al., 2021). There appear to be few tests of (cognitive-affective) inconsistency as a predictor of attitude stability (see Chaiken et al., 1995).\nThe different indicators of attitude strength discussed above are generally considered to be both conceptually and empirically distinct (Luttrell & Sawicki, 2020). Correlations and confirmatory factor analyses support the idea that each constitutes its own latent factor (Krosnick et al., 1993; Lavine et al., 1998), although they are intercorrelated. However, there are only a limited number of studies that examine the effects of more than one predictor of attitude strength at a time and the impact onmore thanone feature of attitude strength (Bassili, 1996; Luttrell & Togans, 2021; Prislin, 1996; see also Philipp-Muller et al., 2020 on predicting intentions). Studies looking at more than one predictor and more than one feature of attitude strength offer the opportunity to compare effects without the potential confounding factors that limit between study comparisons (e.g., sample, behaviour or measure differences). Such studies also allow exploration of the simultaneous effects of different predictors of attitude strength in order to assess if particular predictors dominate in their impact on the stabil-\nity of attitudes and the attitude\u2013behaviour relationship. The current study therefore sought to test the effects of a number of predictors of attitude strength, both individually and simultaneously, on attitude stability and the attitude\u2013behaviour relationship within the same sample across a common set of behaviours."

            "text": "As noted earlier, temporal stability of attitudes and the impact of attitudes on behaviour are not unrelated defining features of attitude strength. In particular, the attitude temporal stability is onemechanism via which strong attitudes may better predict behaviour (i.e., the prediction explanation; Fabrigar et al., 2005). A number of previous studies support this prediction (Davidson& Jaccard, 1979; Schwartz, 1978; see also Glasman & Albarrac\u00edn, 2006). For example, one recent study (Conner et al., 2022) showed, across three studies with 2\u20134 waves of data collection (separating out stability measures frommeasures used to tap the attitude\u2013behaviour relationship), that more stable attitudes were more predictive of subsequent behaviour. Another recent study indicated that attitudes that are temporally stable may even predict behaviour over periods as long as 10 years (Conner & Norman, 2020). The current research provides a further test of the extent towhich stable attitudes are more predictive of behaviour. More importantly, the current research also explored whether any effects of each predictor of attitude strength on the attitude\u2013behaviour relationship could be explained (i.e.,mediated) by effects on attitude stability. Specifically,we tested if themoderating effect of eachpredictor of attitude strengthon the attitude\u2013behaviour relationshipwas attenuated by also controlling for attitude stability and the interaction between stability and attitude (i.e., whether attitude stability mediates the moderating effect of attitude strength predictors on attitude\u2013behaviour relationships). A similar approach to examining if intention stability mediated the effects of moderators of the intention\u2013behaviour relationship was reported by Sheeran and Abraham (2003)."

(2021). Inconsistency (cognitive-affective)was computed as the absolute difference between the responses to the mean of the two cognitive and two affective attitude measures (range 0\u20136; similar to that used by Conner et al., 2021).\nAt T2 the same measure of attitudes (six items per behaviour, Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = .79 to .91; items averaged for each behaviour) was taken. A measure of attitude stability for each behaviour, which was consistent with other research (e.g., Conner et al., 2000; Sheeran & Abraham, 2003), was computed based on four indices: (1) the withinperson correlation between attitude items at T1 and T2; (2) the sum of the absolute difference between attitude items at T1 and T2; (3) the absolute difference between the mean of attitude items at T1 and T2; and (4) the number of attitude items that exhibited change between T1 and T2. Each measure was standardized and averaged for each behaviour (\u03b1s = .82 to .85). The measure was highly skewed towards high stability. Therefore, for all analyses, attitude stability was dichotomized at the median (0 = low stability; 1 = high stability), although the effects for using an alternative split (maximum stability vs. other levels of stability) were very similar (Tables S3 and S4).\nMeasures of behaviour were taken at T2 and T3. These were based on ameasure of performanceof the protectionbehaviour (e.g., \u2018Towhat extent have you done each of the behaviours listed below over the past month?\u2014Worn a face covering in public places, Not at all\u2014All the time\u2019; scored 1\u20137) and performance of the corresponding risk behaviour (e.g., \u2018Towhat extent have you done each of the behaviours listed belowover the pastmonth?\u2014Notworn a face covering in public places, Not at all\u2014 All the time\u2019; scored1\u20137). After reversing the second item the twomeasures were averaged (r = .74, .72 for T2 and T3, respectively). However, this measure was highly skewed towards full compliance (47.5% of responses were scored 7). We therefore dichotomized the measure into full compliance (scored 1) and less than full compliance (scored 0) as full compliancewas the focus of health advice. It is worth noting that this coincides with a median split. The effects for using an alternative split (behaviour abovemid-point vs. other levels of behaviour; 90.0%of responses in first category) were very similar (Tables S3 and S4)."

There was no evidence of significant moderation for attitude elaboration and potential ambivalence. Attitude importance had the strongest moderation effect when the predictors of attitude strength were considered individually (Table 2).\nAttitude stability also significantly moderated the attitude\u2013 behaviour relationship (Table 2, step 1, right-hand panel). However, the effect of attitude stability on attenuating the effects of other moderators was generally modest (Table 2, step 2, right-hand panel) with only the attitude subjective knowledge, moral basis of attitude, and felt ambivalence interaction effects changing from significant (step 1) to non-significant (step 2) after controlling for attitude stability and the interaction between attitude and attitude stability. A one-tailed Z-test was computed comparing the change in the unstandardized coefficients for the interaction between a moderator and attitude when controlling for the effects of attitude stability (step 2) or not (step 1). This indicated that the reduction in the unstandardized coefficients for the interaction was only significant for inconsistency (Z = 1.690, p = .046; largest other value for attitude importance, Z= 1.320, p= .093).\nSimple slopes analyseswereused to test thedirectionofmoderation effects (Preacher, Model 1 at http://www.quantpsy.org/interact/hlm2. htm). This showed that as attitude stability, attitude certainty, attitude importance, attitude subjective knowledge and moral basis of attitude increased from low (M-1SD), to moderate (M) and to high (M+1SD)\nthen the impact of attitude at T1 on behaviour at T2 also increased (Table 4). This supports the view that increasing attitude stability, attitude certainty, attitude importance, attitude subjective knowledge, and moral basis of attitude were associated with increasing attitude\u2013 behaviour relationships. Simple slopes analyses further showed that as felt ambivalence and inconsistency increased from low (M-1SD), to moderate (M) and to high (M+1SD) then the impact of T1 attitude on T2 behaviour decreased (Table 4). This supports the view that increasing felt ambivalence and inconsistency were associated with decreasing attitude\u2013behaviour relationships.\nTable 3 (step 1, right-hand panel) showed that only the moderating effects for attitude importance (p < .001) and inconsistency (p < .05) on theattitude\u2013behaviour relationship remainedwhenall predictorsof attitude strength were considered simultaneously.

In relation to these three aims, the current research indicates a number of notable findings. First, in relation to assessing the relationships among the eight predictors of attitude strength, correlations indicated varying degrees of overlap (Table 1). Strong overlap was notable between attitude certainty and attitude importance and subjective knowledge, plus between attitude importance and the moral basis of attitude, and also between (cognitive-affective) potential ambivalence and inconsistency. Weaker overlap was apparent between the measures of attitude certainty, attitude importance, attitude subjective knowledge, moral basis of attitude and felt ambivalence, and the measures of potential ambivalence and inconsistency. These relationships are in line with previous confirmatory factor analyses on the predictors of attitude strength indicating that, while intercorrelated, they are empirically distinct (Krosnick et al., 1993; Lavine et al., 1998). Simple correlations also indicated that all eight predictors of attitude strength were significantly correlated with the measure of attitude stability, although the magnitude of the correlation was more modest for attitude elaboration aswell as for (cognitive-affective) potential ambivalence.\n10990992, 2022, 4, D ow nloaded from https://onlinelibrary.w iley.com /doi/10.1002/ejsp.2844 by T est, W iley O nline L ibrary on [10/11/2022].

There have been fewer tests of the individual effects of potential ambivalence (Conner & Armitage, 2008), potential cognitive-affective ambivalence and inconsistency in particular (Conner et al., 2021) on attitude stability. Haugtvedt and Petty (1992) found attitude elaboration to be significantly related to attitude stability, inconsistentwith the current null findings, although they used an operativemeasure of elaboration.\nSimultaneous consideration of these different predictors of attitude strength indicated that the pattern of prediction remained (Table 3), although (cognitive-affective) potential ambivalence became non-significant. It would be useful for future research to directly compare the simultaneous impact of these (and other) predictors of attitude strength using both meta-judgmental and operative measures where feasible on different measures of stability of attitudes (see Bassili, 1996). The strongest predictor of attitude stability in the simultaneous analyses presented here (Table 3) was attitude importance supporting claims that it is a key predictor of attitude strength (Howe &Krosnick, 2017).\nIn relation to the effects of the predictors of attitude strength on the attitude\u2013behaviour relationship, increasing attitude certainty, attitude importance, attitude subjective knowledge, moral basis of attitude and decreasing felt ambivalence and (cognitive-affective) inconsistencywere shown tobe individually associatedwith stronger effects of attitude on subsequent behaviour (Table 2). This is consistent with previous research on attitude certainty (Fazio &Zanna, 1978;Warland & Sample, 1973), attitude importance (Bolson, 2013; Kokkinaki & Lunt, 1997; Ziegler & Schlett, 2016), attitude subjective knowledge (Davidson et al., 1985), moral basis of attitude (Judge et al., 2012; Skitka & Bauman, 2008), felt ambivalence (Conner & Armitage, 2008), and (cognitive-affective) inconsistency (Conner et al., 2021). The lack of a moderating effect for potential (cognitive-affective) ambivalence was inconsistent with findings reported by Conner et al. (2021), although their effects were only significant in one of three studies presented. The lack of a significant effect for attitude elaboration is inconsistent with previous research showing higher elaboration being associated with stronger attitude\u2013behaviour relationships (Barden&Petty, 2008). The current study and that of Barden and Petty (2008) differ in relation to the use of a meta-judgmental versus operative measure of attitude elaboration. Future research could usefully further systematically explore the effects of meta-judgmental versus operative measures of attitude elaboration on different defining features of attitude strength.\nThe current research extends previous work by showing that consideration of these predictors of attitude strength simultaneously indicated that only attitude importance and (cognitive-affective) inconsistency were significant moderators of the attitude\u2013behaviour relationship (Table 3). Notably the effects for inconsistency (but not importance) became non-significant when also controlling for the effects of attitude stability. These findings need to be confirmed in future studies but support the view that attitude importance in particular is the dominant predictor of attitude strength (Howe & Krosnick, 2017) as\ntapped by the impact of a strong attitude on subsequent behaviour. It is worth noting that attitude importancewas also a significantmoderator (alongside felt ambivalence)whenpredictingbehaviourover a2-month time period (i.e., at T3; Table S6).\nThird, in relation to our aim to assess if the effects of these predictors of attitude strength on the attitude\u2013behaviour relationship is attenuated (or mediated) by controlling for attitude stability effects, the findings were mainly negative. Controlling for attitude stability effects only significantly attenuated the moderation effect for (cognitive-affective) inconsistency on the attitude\u2013behaviour relationship, although a significant effect remained (Table 2). This suggests that the effects of these various predictors of attitude strength (i.e., attitude certainty, attitude importance, attitude subjective knowledge, moral basis of attitude, felt ambivalence, cognitive-affective inconsistency) do not mainly have their effect on moderating the attitude\u2013 behaviour relationship through attenuating the stability of attitudes. It may be that other mechanisms account for these effects on attitude\u2013 behaviour relationships (e.g., changing perceptions of the attitude object; Fabrigar et al., 2005). Nevertheless, we did observe a strong effect for attitude stability on the attitude\u2013behaviour relationship (in both individual and simultaneous analyses) supporting previous studies on this issue (e.g., Conner et al., 2022; see review by Glasman & Albarrac\u00edn, 2006). More stable attitudes were stronger predictors of later behaviour and this effect was replicated in predicting behaviour at T3 (Tables S5 and S6)when the attitude stability and behaviourmeasures did not share a data collection time point (i.e., T2)."

            "text": "The principal implications of the current research are in relation to Covid-protection behaviours. The findings support the power of attitude towards these behaviours in predicting engagement with these behaviours, particularly when these attitudes are strong as indicated by greater stability, importance, certainty, subjective knowledge and moral basis and have less felt ambivalence and inconsistency. In terms of promoting these behaviours, that might suggest the value of targeting both attitudes and these predictors of attitude strength\u2014especially the importance of these behaviours.\nIt is less clear the extent to which these findings would generalize to other related or unrelated behaviours or non-behaviour attitude objects more generally (e.g., is importance the key strength variable for other attitude objects?). Covid-protection behaviours may be seen as controversial and attitudes towards such behaviours plus the predictors of the strength of such attitudes may therefore possess unique characteristics not shared with other attitude objects. We are not aware of research systematically examining variation in the effects of predictors of attitude strength across different attitude objects. More narrowly in relation to attitudes towards behaviours, Fishbein and Ajzen\u2019s (2010) work suggests that the impact of attitudes (alongside other predictors) on intentions and behaviour may vary across both behaviours and populations and therefore needs to be\n10990992, 2022, 4, D ow nloaded from https://onlinelibrary.w iley.com /doi/10.1002/ejsp.2844 by T est, W iley O nline L ibrary on [10/11/2022].

            "heading": "8.3 Strengths and weaknesses",
            "text": "There are a number of strengths and weaknesses to the reported research. Strengths include the test of eight separate predictors of attitude strength in relation to two different defining features of attitude strength in a large, nationally representative sample on a topical issue. As such, the observed effects for this set of behaviours should be expected to generalize to the UK population. In addition, testing both individual and simultaneous effects of the eight predictors of attitude strength and testing the effects within individuals across multiple behaviours in a prospective design are further strengths. Also, from an applied perspective, the findings highlight the value of targeting attitudes and predictors of attitude strength (particularly increasing importance) as ways to promote this set of behaviours that may have important health consequences within the context of a global pandemic.\nThere are also a number of weaknesses to the present research. First, the use of self-report behaviour measures may have opened the research to various biases, although recent research supports the validity of self-report measures compared to objective measures of behaviour (Gershuny et al., 2019). Nevertheless, the current findings would be considerably strengthened by the use of more objective behavioural measures. Second, showing these effects in a single study means the current findings need replication. Third, our tests were correlational and studies showing similar effects based on manipulations of attitude strength through targeting the predictors of strengthwould be valuable. Fourth, our analyses exploring the impact of attitude stability on the attitude\u2013behaviour relationship usedmeasures of stability taken at the same time point as the behaviour measure (i.e., T2). Analyses predicting behaviour at T3 (reported in Tables) suggest this did not unduly bias the results, although in those analyses the measure of behaviour was taken two rather than 1 month (i.e., time period specified in attitude measure) after the measures of attitude and predictors of attitude strength (T1). Reassuringly, Conner et al. (2022) showed similar effects for attitude stability with studies using two-, three- or four-wave designs.\nFifth, the validity of our measures of attitude strength could be criticized. Table S1 provides evidence of the face validity of each predictor of attitude strength in terms of a good match to established definitions on which they are based. Nevertheless, the measures of importance, moral basis and potential ambivalence plus inconsistency are open to criticism. For example, our measure of attitude importance might be considered as tapping the importance of the issue rather than the importance of the attitude (see Eaton & Visser, 2008 on this distinction). Similarly, our measure of the moral basis of attitude might be criticized for not sufficiently capturing the extent to which the atti-\ntude is based on moral convictions (Skitka, 2014). In relation to our measures of potential ambivalence plus inconsistency, the measures might be criticized for partly using the same items that tapped attitude. However, additional analyses that used attitudemeasures not overlapping with these measures (i.e., Negative-Positive; Bad-Good) showed similar effects. The disagreeable-agreeable semantic differential item might be considered a weak measure of affective attitude, although it showed strong correlation with the other affective item and low overlap with the two cognitive attitude items and similar results were obtained when omitting this item. Relatedly, our scorings of potential ambivalence and inconsistency were taken from Conner et al. (2021), although alternative ways of scoring these constructs have been used (e.g., Maio et al., 2000). More generally, it may be useful for our findings to be confirmed using multi-item measures of the predictors of attitude strength, although this has implications for participant burden in a multi-behaviour study. In addition, the need to use dichotomous scoring of some measures (e.g., potential ambivalence) may have reduced their variance and attenuated effects on attitude strength outcomes.\nSixth, and finally, our research did not test all predictors of attitude strength (Howe & Krosnick, 2017; Luttrell & Sawicki, 2020). Importantly, attitude accessibility was not assessed in our online survey given the reliability of such reaction time measures taken online. Previous research has indicated accessibility to be a consistent moderator of attitude\u2013behaviour relationships (Cooke & Sheeran, 2004) and that accessibility and stability of attitudes are linked which may help explain the impact of accessibility on the attitude\u2013behaviour relationship (Glasman & Albarrac\u00edn, 2006). Future research might usefully assess attitude accessibility alongside other predictors of attitude strength in simultaneous tests. Relatedly, we only looked at effects on one of two aspects of the durability and of the impact components of attitude strength (Krosnick & Petty, 1995). Future research could usefully assess the effect of these predictors of attitude strength both on the resistance to change aspect of durability and the biased information processing aspect of impact."

Increasing attitude certainty, attitude importance, attitude subjective knowledge, moral basis of attitude and decreasing felt ambivalence, and cognitive-affective inconsistency were individually shown to moderate the impact of attitude on subsequent behaviour. Consideration of predictors of attitude strength simultaneously indicated that attitude importance and cognitive-affective inconsistency were the only significant moderators of the attitude\u2013behaviour relationship (with only the former remaining significant when controlling for attitude stability effects). Evidence that these effects were attributable to effects on attitude stability was only found for cognitive-affective inconsistency, and any mediation\n10990992, 2022, 4, D ow nloaded from https://onlinelibrary.w iley.com /doi/10.1002/ejsp.2844 by T est, W iley O nline L ibrary on [10/11/2022].
