    "abstractText": "5 ABSTRACT: Top-down liquid-phase exfoliation (LPE) and 6 bottom-up hot-injection synthesis are scalable methods to produce 7 colloids of two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) solids. 8 Generally thought off as two entirely different fields, we show that 9 similar stabilization mechanisms apply to colloids of molybdenum 10 disulfide (MoS2) produced by both methods. By screening the 11 colloidal stability of MoS2 produced in a hot-injection synthesis in 12 a wide range of solvents, we observe that colloidal stability can be 13 understood based on solution thermodynamics, wherein matching 14 the solubility parameter of solvent and nanomaterial maximizes 15 colloidal stability. Identical to MoS2 produced through LPE, 16 optimal solvents to disperse MoS2 produced from the bottom-up 17 have similar solubility parameters of \u224822 MPa1/2 and include aromatic solvents with polar functionalities, such as o-dichlorobenzene, 18 and polar aprotic solvents, such as N,N-dimethylformamide. We further complemented our findings by nuclear magnetic resonance 19 (NMR) spectrscopy, highlighting that organic surfactants, such as oleylamine and oleic acid, have a minimal affinity toward the 20 nanocrystal surface and engage in a highly dynamic adsorption/desorption equilibrium. We thus conclude that hot injection yields",

By screening the 11 colloidal stability of MoS2 produced in a hot-injection synthesis in 12 a wide range of solvents, we observe that colloidal stability can be 13 understood based on solution thermodynamics, wherein matching 14 the solubility parameter of solvent and nanomaterial maximizes 15 colloidal stability. Identical to MoS2 produced through LPE, 16 optimal solvents to disperse MoS2 produced from the bottom-up 17 have similar solubility parameters of \u224822 MPa1/2 and include aromatic solvents with polar functionalities, such as o-dichlorobenzene, 18 and polar aprotic solvents, such as N,N-dimethylformamide. We further complemented our findings by nuclear magnetic resonance 19 (NMR) spectrscopy, highlighting that organic surfactants, such as oleylamine and oleic acid, have a minimal affinity toward the 20 nanocrystal surface and engage in a highly dynamic adsorption/desorption equilibrium. We thus conclude that hot injection yields 21 MoS2 colloids with comparable surfaces as those produced by LPE. These similarities might offer the prospect of using established 22 procedures developed for LPE nanomaterials to postprocess colloidally synthesized dispersions of 2D colloids as processable inks.\n23 \u25a0 INTRODUCTION 24 The remarkable optoelectronic properties and high surface 25 areas of layered two-dimensional (2D) nanomaterials have 26 sparked widespread research interest.1 Most notably, the 27 transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are intensively 28 investigated as next-generation semiconductors with applica29 tions in the fields of optoelectronics, catalysis, sensing, or 30 energy storage.2\u22126 Molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is by far the 31 most studied member of the TMD family. As a bulk crystal, 32 MoS2 adopts a layered crystal structure consisting of stacked 33 S\u2212Mo\u2212S monolayers. The relatively weak dispersion forces 34 between the layers favor the production of ultrathin mono- and 35 few-layered TMDs using different methods.4 Currently, 36 vacuum deposition and mechanical exfoliation are the most 37 commonly used techniques to manufacture high-quality 38 TMDs,7 yet their high synthesis cost and limited scalability 39 remain key issues. These drawbacks have raised interest in 40 more scalable production methods. As a result, solution-based 41 methods, such as top-down liquid-phase exfoliation (LPE) and 42 bottom-up colloidal synthesis, have attracted significant 43 research interest. These methods are scalable, and solution44 based processing through a variety of deposition methods, e.g., 45 dip- and spin-coating, offers an exciting road to device 46 integration.\n47Both LPE and colloidal synthesis rely on a tight interplay 48between the inorganic and the organic interface. On the one 49hand, seminal studies on layered 2D materials systematically 50demonstrated that stable dispersions of exfoliated nanomateri51als are only obtained in solvents with well-defined solubility 52parameters \u03b4s at around 20\u221227 MPa1/2.8\u221212 These results have 53been rationalized within a broader context of solution 54thermodynamics where a matching of the solubility parameter 55of the solvent and the nanomaterial minimizes the energy of 56mixing. Knowledge of solubility parameters proved essential to 57determine suitable conditions for high-yield exfoliations and 58offered the prospect of postprocessing where stable solvent59exfoliated dispersions were processed into printable inks to 60fabricate printed devices, such as thin-film transistors.13 A 61colloidal synthesis, on the other hand, produces dispersions of 62hybrid nanocrystals where both the inorganic core and the 63organic surfactant shell contribute to the properties of the\nReceived: February 27, 2023 Revised: April 13, 2023\nArticlepubs.acs.org/Langmuir\n\u00a9 XXXX American Chemical Society A\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.3c00546 Langmuir XXXX, XXX, XXX\u2212XXX\ncxs00 | ACSJCA | JCA11.2.5208/W Library-x64 | manuscript.3f (R5.2.i3:5013 | 2.1) 2022/08/03 13:05:00 | PROD-WS-116 | rq_9269613 | 4/20/2023 09:04:15 | 12 | JCA-DEFAULT\n64 nanocrystal.14\u221216 Over the past decade, the importance of the 65 surfactant/inorganic interface layer has been pointed out by 66 numerous authors. The ligand shell has a pivotal role in the 67 stabilization of NC dispersion17 but also controls the shape18 68 and the size19 of the nanocrystal during growth. In a similar 69 way as it did for LPE nanomaterials, rational control of the 70 interface proved indispensable to advance in research areas as 71 diverse as optoelectronics,20,21 catalysis,22 and thermoelec72 trics.23\n73 Clearly, in both fields, insights in the inorganic/organic 74 interface layer proved essential to improving the material\u2019s 75 performance. Nevertheless, despite the staggering growth in 76 colloidal transition-metal chalcogenide (c-TMD) synthesis 77 protocols,24\u221226,26\u221241 the interface between the NC and the 78 surrounding organic medium is barely understood. Perhaps 79 most remarkably, nearly all proof-of-concept applications 80 involving colloidal TMDs exploit the surface of these 81 compounds either as a catalyst for hydrogen evolution 82 reactions,34,35,38,40,42 as gas sensor,38 as hydrogenation 83 catalyst,33 or as battery materials.32,41 84 In this study, we investigated the inorganic/organic interface 85 of colloidal molybdenum disulfide (c-MoS2) nanosheets made 86 through hot injection. Starting from the observation that the 87 colloidal stability of c-MoS2 heavily depends on the solvent 88 choice, we screened the stability of the synthesized c-MoS2 89 nanosheets in a wide range of solvents. Similar to van der 90 Waals solids produced by LPE, we show that colloidal stability 91 can be understood from solution thermodynamics, where the 92 solubility parameter of the solvent is an apt descriptor to 93 predict the colloidal stability of c-MoS2 nanosheets. More 94 specifically, we found that the most optimal solvents are 95 characterized by a solubility parameter of 21.5 \u00b1 0.3 MPa1/2. 96 Such values are attained by aromatic solvents with polar 97 groups, such as o-dichlorobenzene, or even polar aprotic 98 solvents, such as DMF. These findings are complemented by 99 NMR analyses, which demonstrated ligands, such as oleyl100 amine and oleic acid, have a minimal affinity toward the NC 101 surface and engage in a highly dynamic adsorption/desorption 102 equilibrium. A direct consequence of such a dynamic 103 interaction is that c-MoS2 has limited colloidal stability in 104 typical apolar solvents with a too-low solubility parameter. We 105 thus conclude that hot injection yields c-MoS2 nanosheets with 106 comparable interfaces as those produced by LPE, where 107 colloidal stability of dispersions and inks is linked to a 108 matching of the solvent and nanomaterial solubility parame109 ters. This finding might offer the prospect of using established 110 procedures developed for LPE nanomaterials for postprocess111 ing of colloidally synthesized TMD dispersions as processable 112 inks.\n113 \u25a0 EXPERIMENTAL SECTION 114 Chemicals. We used the following chemicals: oleic acid (OA, 90%, 115 Alfa Aesar), oleylamine (OLA, 80\u221290%, Acros Organics), carbon 116 disulfide (CS2, \u226599%, Sigma-Aldrich), molybdenum(V) chloride 117 (MoCl5, 99.99%, Sigma-Aldrich), 1,2-dichlorobenzene (o-DCB, 99%, 118 Acros Organics), 1,2-dichlorobenzene-d4 for NMR (o-DCB-d4, 98% 119 atom D, Acros Organics), hexane (normapur, VWR), heptane (99.8%, 120 VWR), octane (99.5%+, Chem-Lab Analytical), cyclohexane (99.5%+, 121 Chem-Lab Analytical), toluene (technical, VWR), acetonitrile (ACN, 122 normapur, VWR), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP, \u226599.0%, Merck), 123 N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF, \u226599.0%, Acros Organics), 1- 124 methylnaphthalene (\u226596.0%, Acros Organics), 1,2-dichlorobenzene 125 (o-DCB, \u226599.0%, Acros Organics), ethanol (technical, VWR),\n126methanol (\u226599.9%, Merck), pyridine (99.0%+, VWR), n-octane 127(technical \u226595%, VWR Chemicals), and 1-butanol (\u226599.5%, Merck). 128Colloidal Synthesis of c-MoS2. We synthesized c-MoS2 129nanosheets according to Son et al.31 We refer the reader to 130Supporting Information Section S1.1 for a pictorial representation 131of the reaction procedure and a photograph of the reaction setup. To 132prepare the precursor solution, MoCl5 (54 mg, 0.2025 mmol), OA 133(2.25 mL), and OLA (15 mL) were mixed together (denoted as 134mixture 1) in an inert atmosphere. Simultaneously, OLA (15 mL) was 135loaded into another three-neck round-bottom flask (denoted as 136mixture 2) and degassed at an elevated temperature. Both solutions 137were further flushed with three consecutive nitrogen\u2212vacuum cycles 138to remove traces of residual volatile components. Subsequently, 139mixture 2 was heated to 320 \u00b0C under an inert nitrogen atmosphere. 140Meanwhile, CS2 (0.1 mL, in excess) was introduced in mixture 1 at 141room temperature. This viscous precursor solution was rapidly 142introduced in a nitrogen-flushed glass syringe and injected over 30 143min into mixture 2 at 320 \u00b0C. After injection, we kept the reaction 144mixture at 320 \u00b0C for another 90 min. The c-MoS2 sheets were 145precipitated by adding butanol, collected by centrifugation (10000g), 146and redispersed in toluene under mild sonication. Afterward, the 147sample was subjected to successive washing steps with ethanol as the 148nonsolvent and toluene as the solvent as follows: to a c-MoS2 149dispersion in toluene, ethanol was added as a nonsolvent in a 1:1 150ratio with respect to toluene. The dispersion was centrifuged at 5000 151rpm for 5 min (Eppendorf model 5804). The cloudy supernatant was 152discarded, and the precipitate was redispersed in the same amount of 153toluene. 154For the solubility study, 0.5 mL of c-MoS2 in toluene (washed once 155as described above) was added to 4 mL vials. To each vial, we added 1560.5 mL of ethanol, centrifuged the dispersion at 5000 rpm for 5 min, 157and discarded the clear and colorless supernatant. We added 2 mL of 158solvent (a full solvent list is provided in Table S4) to each c-MoS2 159pellet and solubilized the mixture under mild sonication in a bath 160sonicator for 15 min (USC-THD, VWR). Once solubilized, we 161measured the attenuance of a dilution immediately. After 48 h, we 162measured the attenuance D48 of the stable fraction present in the 163supernatant in a similar manner. 164UV\u2212Vis Spectroscopy. Attenuance spectra were recorded on 165either a PerkinElmer Lambda 950 or a PerkinElmer Lambda 365 166spectrometer. The samples were studied as diluted dispersions in o167DCB in quartz cuvettes with a path length of 1 cm. 168Raman Spectroscopy. Raman spectra were recorded on a 169KAISER dispersive RXNI spectrometer (operating at 532 nm) 170equipped with a noncontact probe. The samples were studied as 171concentrated dispersions in o-DCB. 172X-ray Diffraction. X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements were 173performed on a Thermo Scientific ARM X\u2032tra X-ray diffractometer 174with the Cu K\u03b1 (\u03bb = 0.154 nm) line as primary source. The samples 175were studies as films on glass. 176Transmission Electron Microscopy. Bright-field transmission 177electron microscopy (TEM) images were taken on a Cs-corrected 178JEOL 2200-FS TEM operated at an acceleration voltage of 200 kV. 179Samples for TEM were prepared by diluting dispersions in toluene 180and drop-casting the nearly transparent dispersion on a holey 181carbon\u2212Cu grid (HC200-Cu, 200 mesh). Traces of volatile 182components were removed by drying the sample overnight in a 183vacuum tube connected to a Schlenk line or in the antechamber of a 184glovebox. 185Atomic Force Microscopy. For the height analysis, the particles 186were imaged by atomic force microscopy (AFM) after we cast a 187dispersion in o-DCB onto a SiO2 wafer. Because of the closely 188matching solubility parameters of o-DCB and c-MoS2, spin-coating 189from o-DCB allows the measurement of individual nanosheets as 190aggregation is limited. All measurements were performed on a Bruker 191Dimension Edge equipped with a NCHV probe using tapping mode 192in air. 193Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy. Samples used in 194nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments were prepared by 195drying a purified dispersion containing colloidal MoS2 in o-\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.3c00546 Langmuir XXXX, XXX, XXX\u2212XXX\nB\n196 dichlorobenzene under a mild nitrogen flow, followed by redispersion 197 in deuterated 1,2-dichlorobenzene, henceforth denoted as o198 dichlorobenzene-d4. The NMR spectra were recorded at a 1H 199 frequency of 500.13 MHz, either on a Bruker Avance III Ascend 200 spectrometer equipped with a BBI-Z probe or on a Bruker Avance II 201 spectrometer equipped with a TXI-Z probe. All spectra were 202 measured at a temperature of 298.15 K using standard pulse 203 sequences from the Bruker pulse program library. 1H spectra were 204 recorded with a 20 s d1 delay between the scans to ensure a full 205 relaxation of all the NMR signals. Diffusion-ordered spectroscopy 206 (DOSY) experiments were recorded using a double stimulated echo 207 sequence to account for convection and a bipolar gradient pulse 208 program to minimize signal loss due to T2 relaxation. In such an 209 experiment, the diffusion decay was recorded in 64 steps while the 210 squared gradient strength was varied from 95% up to 2% of the probes 211 maximum value. The gradient pulse duration and diffusion delay were 212 optimized to guarantee that at least 90% of the signal decayed at the 213 highest gradient strength. In a nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy 214 (NOESY) experiment, the parameters were set as follows: 4096 and 215 512 time domain points in the direct and indirect dimension, 216 respectively, a spectral width of 12 ppm, and the number of scans 217 varying from 8 to 32 depending on the signal intensity. The mixing 218 time was 300 ms unless otherwise specified. Afterward, the data were 219 processed in Bruker TopSpin 4.0.6 and IgorPro 6. 220 NMR Experiments Involving Lead Oleate. Lead oleate was 221 prepared according to the literature.43 A stock solution was prepared 222 by dissolving lead oleate in o-dichlorobenzene-d4 (27.2 mg in 500\n223\u03bcL). Subsequently, lead oleate was added in a 10-fold excess with 224respect to the amount of the original ligands (determined by Digital 225ERETIC) present in the dispersion that contains c-MoS2 in o226dichlorobenzene-d4."

We refer to the Experimental Section and 235Supporting Information Section S1.1 for additional informa236tion regarding the experimental procedure. 237Figure 1 summarizes the most relevant material character238istics of the c-MoS2 nanosheets that were studied in this work. 239The transmission electron microscopy (TEM) image, provided 240in Figure 1b, indicates that the synthesis method yields two241dimensional and partly folded nanosheets with lateral 242dimensions of the order of 100 nm.

These patterns agree with 247 the (101) and (110) lateral planes of MoS2 and line up with 248 the X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis presented in Figure 1c.47 249 In addition, we observe the characteristic diffractions of the 250 hexagonal (2H) MoS2 phase in the X-ray diffractogram. Most 251 notably, the c-plane reflections are weak and broad while the 252 reflections of the lateral planes are intense and sharp. In the 253 literature, such a pattern has been associated with less-ordered 254 stacking in the vertical direction, i.e., thin crystals.48,49 We 255 provide a more detailed assignment of the X-ray diffractogram 256 in Supporting Information Section S1.3. 257 The finding that the synthesis yields 2H MoS2 is attested by 258 the Raman spectrum in Figure 1d, which reveals the 259 characteristic A1g and E2g vibrational modes of hexagonal 260 MoS2. The layer number could be determined from the 261 frequency difference between both vibrational modes. As this 262 difference amounts to 23 cm\u22121 on average, the few-layered c263 MoS2 nanosheets consist of approximately three MoS2 264 monolayers on average (see Figure 1e and Supporting 265 Information Section S1.4).45,50 Additionally, as plotted in 266 Figure 1f, three characteristic resonances of 2H MoS2 appear in 267 the attenuance spectrum. The resonances labeled A and B, at 268 approximately 665 and 614 nm, respectively, make up the 269 transitions between the spin\u2212orbit split valence-band maxima 270 and the conduction-band minimum at the K point.2,51,52 The 271 spectral position assigned to these resonances was obtained 272 from a derivative analysis of the attenuance spectrum (see 273 Supporting Information Section S1.5). The prominent C 274 absorption at around 420 nm, on the other hand, originates 275 from transitions between the valence and conduction band 276 along the direction from K to \u0393, where these bands are mostly 277 parallel.53 Backes et al. reported a sizing curve for LPE MoS2 278 (see Figure 1g) that allows us to determine the layer number N 279 based on the spectral position of the A exciton.46 As the A 280 exciton is located at 665 nm, we expect a synthesized c-MoS2 281 sheet to be a buildup of approximately 3 monolayers on 282 average. 283 Although Raman spectroscopy and UV\u2212vis spectroscopy 284 indirectly attested the layer number, we decided to measure 285 the height of the flakes directly with atomic force microscopy 286 (AFM) (see Figure 1h).54 AFM provides height statistics, 287 which are translatable into a layer number because the 288 thickness of a single MoS2 monolayer (t \u2248 0.7 nm) is 289 known. We measured the height of approximately 100 290 nanosheets and summarized the information in the histogram 291 provided in Figure 1i and Supporting Information Section 292 S1.6. First, we quantified the thickness by the arithmic mean \u00b1 293 1 standard deviation, yielding an average thickness of 2.5 \u00b1 1.0 294 nm. Alternatively, we fit the height distribution to a Gaussian 295 function using the width and the central position of the 296 Gaussian as fit parameters. The respective Gaussian is centered 297 at 2.1 nm and has a full width at half-maximum (fwhm) of 1.1 298 nm. Using a literature value of 0.7 nm as the thickness of a 299 monolayer (a value neatly corresponding to c/2 determined by 300 XRD earlier), these figures indicate that the c-MoS2 sheets 301 analyzed here consist of approximately 3 to 4 MoS2 302 monolayers. Importantly, the layer number extracted following 303 indirect methods such as UV\u2212vis spectroscopy and Raman 304 spectroscopy agrees well with the quantification done by AFM. 305 Such an observation could suggest that the top and bottom 306 facets are in fact unpassivated by ligands. As summarized in\nt1 307 Table 1, these measurements indicate that the dispersions 308 studied in this work consist of two-dimensional and few-\n309layered (N \u2248 3) c-MoS2 nanosheets crystallized into the 310desired semiconducting 2H phase. 311Stabilizing c-MoS2 Nanosheets by Solvent Interac312tions. Observations. While purifying the dispersions 313presented in Figure 1, we observed rapid aggregation in 314commonly used solvents in nanocrystal syntheses, such as 315(cyclo)hexane, toluene, and chloroform. A similar observation 316had already been reported by Mahler et al.24 In their study, 2H 317WS2 nanosheets tended to aggregate over time, and additional 318washing steps by precipitation rendered the product less 319dispersible in hexane. At the same time we noticed that 320redispersion of c-MoS2 in o-dichlorobenzene resulted in stable 321dispersions that show little or no sedimentation over time. In 322addition, after a routine purification cycle involving the 323removal of the native reaction mixture by centrifugation and 324two additional washing steps with ethanol, we were able to 325redisperse the MoS2 pellet in polar solvents under mild 326sonication. For instance, c-MoS2 dispersed in N,N-dimethyl327formamide, a common exfoliation solvent (vide supra), formed 328colloids that remained stable for months. These observations 329contrast with the behavior of nanocrystals synthesized in an 330apolar reaction mixture by hot injection. For instance, 2D 331CdSe nanoplatelets packed with organic surfactant molecules 332are most stable in (cyclo)hexane,55,56 while QDs are usually 333dispersed in hexane or toluene.57 Additionally, a nanocrystal 334transfer from an apolar to a polar solvent typically involves the 335laborsome exchange of the native apolar surfactant layer to a 336polar ligand shell using a two-phase system.58\n337Conceivably, these observations point to a similar 338stabilization mechanism as seen in liquid-phase exfoliated 339layered colloids. Here, conditions for high-yield exfoliations are 340interpretated as a matching of the solubility parameter of the 341solvent and the van der Waals (vdW) solid according to the 342Hildebrand\u2212Scatchard solution theory of mixing.59\u221261 For a 343bare MoS2 nanosheet, Cunningham et al.\n8 estimated the 344solubility parameter to be \u224822 MPa1/2 by screening LPE in a 345wide range of solvents. Interestingly, o-dichlorobenzene has a 346closely matching solubility parameter (20.5 MPa1/2) to the one 347of a bare MoS2 surface. On the other hand, typical apolar 348solvent solubility parameters range from 15 to 18 MPa1/2 and 349match those of usual apolar surfactant molecules used in hot350injection syntheses.62 In this respect, the question stands out as 351to whether the concepts developed for liquid-phase exfoliation 352also apply to nanomaterials synthesized through hot injection. 353Solubility Parameter Matching in Practice. According to 354solution thermodynamics, optimal dispersion occurs in 355solvents with solubility parameters that match the solubility 356parameter of the solute. When optimizing the liquid-phase"

The outcome of 360 such screening studies is then represented by plots showing the 361 amount of material obtained after exfoliation as a function of 362 \u03b4s. Such experiments showed that liquid-phase exfoliation 363 works best for solvents within a limited range of solubility 364 parameters for very different materials.8,9,63\u221272 365 Applying these concepts to colloids of 2D materials 366 synthesized through bottom-up synthesis, we purified the c367 MoS2 colloid through a regular purification cycle (two washing 368 cycles) and dispersed the precipitated c-MoS2 pellet in a series\nf2 369 of solvents with known solubility parameters \u03b4s (Figure 2a, step 370 a). We rationally chose solvents with diverse solubility 371 parameters in the range of approximately 15\u221230 MPa1/2 and 372 included the most common nanocrystal solvents (e.g., hexane, 373 cyclohexane, chloroform, and toluene) and nonsolvents (e.g., 374 acetonitrile, ethanol, and methanol) in our study. Besides, we 375 incorporated typical solvents known to result in high-yield 376 exfoliations by LPE (e.g., NMP, DMF, and butanol).9,59,72\n377 Next, we solubilized the resulting mixtures under mild 378 sonication in a bath sonicator (Figure 2a, step b). We left 379 the dispersions untouched for 48 h, and subsequently, we 380 carefully separated the supernatant from the sediment (Figure 381 2a, step c) for visual inspection and quantitative analysis by 382 UV\u2212vis absorbance spectroscopy. We refer to the Exper383 imental Section and Supporting Information Section S2 for a 384 more detailed description of the experimental procedure.\n385Visual Inspection and Basic Quantitative Analysis. After 386sonication (Figure 2, step b), we immediately noticed that c387MoS2 rapidly aggregated in hexane and methanol\ufffdsolvents 388with the smallest and largest \u03b4s, respectively. In other solvents, 389clear sedimentation occurred within hours, yet a colored 390supernatant is still visible after 48 h. As already stated, 391dispersions in o-dichlorobenzene are stable without any visible 392sedimentation. For a visual inspection after 48 h, we carefully 393decanted the supernatant from the sediment and arranged the 394supernatants of the dispersions from a small to a large 395solubility parameter in Figure 2b. For a better visual 396comparison, we diluted each supernatant further in the same 397manner. In this way, we distinguish three regimes in agreement 398with the solubility parameter of the solvent. As c-MoS2 rapidly 399aggregated in aliphatic hydrocarbons with the smallest 400solubility parameter, such solvents result in colorless, optically 401transparent to nearly transparent supernatants. Strikingly, those 402are common laboratory solvents to disperse NCs. The same 403holds for solvents with the largest solubility parameter, such as 404ethanol and methanol. In contrast, we obtained colored 405dispersions in solvents with an intermediate solubility 406parameter. 407Standard UV\u2212vis spectroscopy allows us to compare 408dispersions in different solvents quantitatively. Hence, we 409recorded the attenuance D of c-MoS2 in each dispersion after 410sonication (step b) and after 48 h (step c). As a metric for the 411dispersion stability, we use the ratio f of D after 48 h over the 412initial attenuance. As higher energy transitions are typically less\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.3c00546 Langmuir XXXX, XXX, XXX\u2212XXX\nE\n413 influenced by size quantization effects, we use the attenuance 414 at 400 nm. Given this definition, f = 0 characterizes a 415 nonsolvent (100% sedimentation), and values for f close to 1 are 416 distinctive for stable dispersions. Figure 2c summarizes the 417 main result of the analysis by plotting f for each c-MoS2/ 418 solvent combination as a function of the solvent solubility 419 parameter. In line with the visual inspection, we record low 420 values for f in low and high \u03b4s solvents, and f approaches 1 for 421 intermediate \u03b4s solvents with solubility parameters at around 422 20\u221225 MPa1/2. The distribution appears to reach a maximum 423 at a position in-between the experimental data points of o-DCB 424 and NMP. Quantifying an optimal value for the solubility 425 parameter based on the weighted arithmetic mean (see 426 Supporting Information Section S2), the optimal solubility 427 parameter \u03b40 of synthesized MoS2 measures 21.5 MPa1/2.72\u221274 428 Following the line of thought presented in refs 8, 9, and 429 63\u221272, we quantified the central position and the width of the 430 distribution through a Gaussian fit. Fitting a Gaussian function 431 to the experimental data in Figure 2d, yields a value for \u03b40 of 432 21.5 \u00b1 0.3 MPa1/2. The optimal c-MoS2 solubility parameter 433 determined by solution theory agrees well with the weighted 434 arithmetic mean determined above. Most interestingly, this 435 number corresponds with the reported solubility parameter of\nt2 436 liquid-phase exfoliated MoS2 8 (22 MPa1/2, see Table 2)\n437stabilized only by solvent interactions, i.e., in the absence of 438surfactant molecules. Considering the excellent agreement 439between materials prepared by two very different methods with 440different architectures, this observation implies that the 441remaining ligands in the dispersions, if present, hardly 442influence the physicochemical properties of the c-MoS2 443surface. 444Analysis Using Flory\u2212Huggins Theory. Recently, we have 445shown that the solubility parameter window in which 446exfoliation proceeds can be understood based on Flory\u2212 447Huggins theory. Similar to polymer mixtures, binary mixtures 448of a colloid dispersed in a solvent are defined by a solvent/ 449solute exchange parameter \u03c7, and it is predicted that a colloid 450of an exfoliated material will be stable for exchange parameters 451below a critical value of \u03c7c = 0.5.75 As such, we quantified \u03c7 for 452each solvent/c-MoS2 combination according to\nv kT ( )0 s 0 2=\n453(1)\n454with v0 being the molecular volume of the solvent and k the 455Boltzmann constant. As a value for the solute solubility 456parameter, we used either the number determined based on 457the stability study in Figure 2d (\u03b40 = 21.5 MPa1/2, open 458markers in Figure 2e) or the value for exfoliated MoS2 reported 459by Cunningham8 (\u03b40 = 22 MPa1/2, filled markers in Figure 2e). 460For exchange parameters smaller than 0.5, the entropy gain 461outweighs the energetic costs of mixing, such that the free 462energy of mixing is negative, and mixing is energetically 463favorable. In line with these predictions, f converges to 1 in 464small \u03c7 solvents while it plunges steadily to 0 once \u03c7 exceeds 465the critical value of 0.5. 466Validation Using Optimal \u03b4 Solvents. A prerequisite to any 467successful model is its predictability. Based on the results 468outlined above, we expect that c-MoS2 forms stable dispersions\nTable 2.

Using the Hansen database,76 we identified pyridine 471 (\u03b4s = 21.5 MPa1/2) and 1-methylnaphthalene (\u03b4s = 21.1 472 MPa1/2) as potential candidates; we marked those solvents 473 with yellow squares in Figures 2d. Most importantly, both 474 solvents result in stable dispersions without any noticeable 475 sedimentation ( f \u2248 1) and thereby follow the predictions made 476 by solution theory. These results strongly validate our 477 approach. 478 Dynamic Ligand Passivation of As-Synthesized C479 MoS2 Nanosheets by Native Ligands. Solution 1H NMR 480 Toolbox. Building further on the observation that colloidal 481 MoS2 behaves as if nanosheets were unpassivated by surfactant 482 molecules, we decided to analyze the organic ligand shell by\nf3 483 nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (see Figure f3 484 3 and Supporting Information Section S3). Figure 3a plots a\n485 1H NMR spectrum of a colloidal MoS2 dispersion in o486 dichlorobenzene (o-DCB). Apart from the resonances 487 associated with the solvent o-DCB at 7 ppm (\u2021), the spectrum\n488is dominated by a series of resonances ascribed to different 489protons in the oleyl chain of oleylamine and oleic acid\ufffdthe 490ligands present in the chemical synthesis (viz. Figure 1a). The 491two prominent resonances in the spectrum at 0.9 ppm and in492between 1.0 and 1.8 ppm are respectively associated with the 493protons in the terminal methyl moiety a and the methylene 494proton pool b, while the resonances at 2.0 and 5.4 ppm are 495respectively assigned to protons in the \u03b1-methylene c and the 496alkene d group. The resonances in the 1H NMR spectra of the 497sample are moderately broadened and lack fine structure. 498Besides, they are slightly shifted toward higher chemical shift 499values (i.e., downfield). For instance, the \u03b1-methylene 500resonance shifts a mere \u22480.005 ppm, while the alkene 501resonance shifts \u22480.04 ppm. For clarity, we provide zooms 502of both resonances in Figure 3b. Throughout the literature, 503line width broadening has been rationalized as a sign of 504surface\u2212ligand interaction.55,77\u221280 Nonetheless, we point out 505that the limited chemical shift changes and line width changes\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.3c00546 Langmuir XXXX, XXX, XXX\u2212XXX\nG\n506 rather line up with the characteristic behavior of a dynamic 507 (labile) ligand than that of a tightly bound moiety.81,82 508 To identify if the resonances present after work-up are 509 attributed to either oleylamine or oleic acid, we exchanged 510 oleylamine for dioctylamine (DOA) in the synthesis and 511 summarized those experiments in Supporting Information 512 Section S3.1. In contrast to oleylamine and oleic acid, 513 dioctylamine is a saturated amine and thereby lacks alkene 514 protons. As shown in Figure 3c, the absence of the alkene 515 resonance in such dispersions suggests the oleic acid is not 516 present in the ligand shell. Such a finding points to a dominant 517 interaction by amines, which likely takes place through a 518 donor\u2212acceptor bond between the free electrons of oleyl519 amine, acting as a Lewis base, and the empty d orbitals of 520 molybdenum, acting as a Lewis acid. 521 Two-dimensional NMR techniques are generally more 522 conclusive to distinguish between tightly bound ligands and 523 dynamic ligands. In particular, the combination of nuclear 524 Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) and diffusion525 ordered spectroscopy (DOSY) offers a unique framework to 526 study the ligand binding motive by monitoring the diffusion 527 coefficient D and the nOE buildup of the species in solution. 528 Compared to a 1D 1H spectrum, 2D spectroscopy allows for a 529 more straightforward distinction between a tightly bound, a 530 free, and a dynamic ligand.57 As highlighted in the DOSY 531 spectrum in Figure 3d, resonances associated with different 532 protons in the oleyl chain diffuse with the same diffusion 533 coefficient of \u224810\u22129.6 m2/s, or 245 \u00b1 10 \u03bcm2/s (see 534 Supporting Information Section S3.2). The Stokes\u2212Einstein 535 equation relates the diffusion coefficient to the solvodynamic 536 radius rH through the friction coefficient f\nD k T\nf B=\n537 (2)\n538 In this most simple case, i.e., for spherical particles, f equals 539 6\u03c0rH\u03b7, with \u03b7 being the solvent viscosity. For spherical 540 particles, eq 2 yields a solvodynamic radius of 1.3 \u00b1 0.1 nm. 541 Alternatively, we calculated the apparent dimensions of the 542 ligands for a disc-shaped geometry ( f = 12rH\u03b7), resulting in rH 543 = 2.1 \u00b1 0.1 nm. Irrespective of the precise functional 544 dependence of rH on D, these numbers differ significantly 545 from the expected diffusion coefficient of a large nanosheet 546 with TEM dimensions of a hundred nanometers. Based on the 547 Stokes\u2212Einstein Equation, we rationalize that such an object\u2019s 548 diffusion coefficient is several orders of magnitude smaller and 549 falls in the order of \u223c1 \u03bcm2/s. 550 Off-diagonal cross-peaks with weak negative nOE intensities 551 appear in the NOESY spectrum of the MoS2 dispersion 552 (Figure 3e) and provide evidence for an interaction of the 553 ligands with the surface of the NC. The intensity a cross-peak 554 attains during such an experiment depends on the spin 555 polarization transfer from the initially polarized resonance to 556 the other resonances in the chain. For instance, polarizing the 557 alkene protons d, the initial magnetization of the two alkene 558 protons is transferred to the (n \u2212 2) other protons in the chain 559 (n = 37 for oleylamine). In this way, if every molecule has 560 spent time on the surface during the mixing phase, a fraction (n 561 \u2212 2)/n of the initial polarization ought to be transferred. We 562 would expect a total polarization transfer of 90\u221295% for long563 chained molecules at sufficiently long mixing times. Opposite 564 from this prediction, the sum of the integrated cross-peaks only 565 contains a mere 5% of the diagonal intensity, a low number\n566again pointing to a weak interaction between oleylamine and c567MoS2. 568A moderate resonance broadening and limited changes in 569chemical shift, a fast ligand diffusion coefficient, and weak 570nOEs imply that the ligands are not tightly bound to the 571surface of the c-MoS2 nanosheet. Instead, they exchange 572dynamically between a bound and a free state.57,82 Most likely, 573such a dynamic interaction is responsible for the limited 574colloidal stability of c-MoS2 in commonly used NC solvents 575(e.g., hexane, chloroform, and toluene). It is worth mentioning 576that we observed a similar weak ligand binding of surfactants to 577colloidal WSe2. 83\n578Dynamic Passivation of c-MoS2 Nanosheets by Lewis 579Acids. Observations. One could think of alternative ligands 580that are compatible with the surface of MoS2. Metal 581carboxylate salts are appealing candidates as they could act 582as Lewis acids coordinating to the sulfur atoms in the top and 583 f4bottom planes of a MoS2 layer (see Figure 4a). Based on the 584Pearson hardness/softness principle,84 we expect soft metal 585complexes to bind stronger to the relatively soft S2\u2212 ions 586present in the top and bottom facets. In this respect, Pb2+ 587complexes are good candidates. As an exploratory experiment, 588we added lead oleate to an unstable c-MoS2 dispersion in 589toluene. Both the dispersions with and without lead oleate are 590homogenized and centrifuged. While the native dispersion is 591colloidally unstable, supplying a metal carboxylate salt proves 592efficient to stabilize the dispersion to a great extent (see Figure 5934b). However, subsequent purification cycles with ethanol as a 594nonsolvent readily destabilize the dispersion. This exploratory 595experiment already points to a labile interaction between the 596capping ligand and the nanocrystal. 597Solution 1H NMR Toolbox. Following the line of thought 598presented above, we used the solution NMR toolbox to 599elucidate the ligand binding of lead oleate to the c-MoS2 600surface. To do so, lead oleate was added in a 10-fold excess 601with respect to the amount of oleylamine present in the 602dispersion (see the Experimental Section). The sample 603containing lead oleate and c-MoS2 is henceforth denoted as 604c-MoS2/Pb(OA)2. The 1H NMR spectrum of such a c-MoS2/ 605Pb(OA)2 dispersion (Figure 4c, blue curve) shows a series of 606moderately broadened resonances in comparison to the sharp 607resonances of a blank lead oleate solution (Figure 4c, gray 608curve). Additionally, the DOSY spectrum in Figure 4d only 609shows a single value for the lead oleate diffusion coefficient (D 610\u2248 200 \u00b1 10 \u03bcm2/s), and this value hardly differs from the 611diffusion coefficient of free lead oleate (see Supporting 612Information Section S4.1). Both observations hint at a loosely 613bound ligand in a fast exchange between a free and a bound 614state. Nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy confirms this 615assumption. The NOESY spectrum in Figure 4e shows off616diagonal cross-peaks with strongly negative nOEs arising from 617ligands interacting with the surface of the NCs. The 618combination of 1H NMR, DOSY, and NOESY thus 619unambiguously points to lead oleate being in a fast exchange 620between a free and a bound state. Here again, the 621manifestation of a ligand that readily attaches and detaches 622from the surface is in line with the observation that colloidally 623stable dispersions are only obtained in the presence of an 624excess of free ligand as well as the fact that extensive washing 625returns the dispersion to its original colloidal instability. 626NoE Buildup Curves. To study the ligand binding in more 627detail, we constructed an nOE buildup curve by analyzing the 628intensity of the nOE cross-peaks as a function of the nOE\nhttps://doi.org/10.1021/acs.langmuir.3c00546 Langmuir XXXX, XXX, XXX\u2212XXX\nH\n629 mixing time. The intensity Iij a cross-peak attains during such 630 an experiment depends on the transfer of the spin polarization 631 from the initially polarized resonance i to the resonance j and 632 the loss of initial polarization during the mixing phase due to 633 longitudinal T1 relaxation. As such, the buildup curve can be 634 described by82\nI t I C R t R t ( ) (0) exp( )(1 exp( )) ij ii ij L C= 635 (3)\n636 with Iij(t) being the intensity of the cross-peak between 637 resonance i and j and Iii(0) the intensity of the diagonal peak of 638 the polarized resonance i at t = \u03c4mix = 0. The rate constant RC 639 describes cross-relaxation of spin polarization from resonance i 640 to j, and RL describes the longitudinal T1 relaxation rate. In the 641 absence of longitudinal T1 relaxation (RL equal to zero), the 642 relative intensity that an nOE cross-peak would attain is equal 643 to the prefactor Cij. In this way, the sum of the prefactors 644 equals the amount of spin polarization transferred from 645 resonance i to all the other resonances in the chain. As the 646 buildup of a negative nOE intensity is solely due to ligands that 647 reside on the surface, summing Cij over all possible resonances 648 j allows us to estimate the fraction of bound ligands. For 649 instance, starting from an initial polarization of the alkene 650 protons (6), the initial magnetization of the 2 alkene protons is 651 transferred to 32 other protons. In this way, if every molecule 652 has spent time on the surface, i.e., under conditions of fast 653 exchange, 32/34 of the initial polarization is transferred, and 654 we expect a total polarization transfer of 94% or approximately 655 3% per hydrogen nucleus. 656 In practice, we measured NOESY spectra at different mixing 657 times ranging from 10 to 500 ms. For simplicity, we focus on 658 the alkene resonance as it is isolated from the rest. At each 659 mixing time, we integrated the diagonal alkene resonance and 660 each off-diagonal cross-peak, yielding the respective intensities 661 I6\u22126(t) and I6\u2212i(t). For instance, I6\u22124(t) denotes the cross-peak 662 intensity ascribed to the spin transfer from alkene (6) to \u03b1663 CH2 (4). We summarized this analysis by plotting I6\u2212i(t)\nf5 664 normalized by I6\u22126(0) in Figure 5a. As the value for I6\u22126(0), 665 the initial intensity present in the diagonal before mixing, we 666 used the value at the shortest mixing time of 10 ms. At such 667 short mixing times, barely any cross-relaxation has occurred, 668 and most of the intensity is present in the diagonal. 669 Knowledge of the longitudinal relaxation rate is required to 670 fit the experimental data set to eq 3. However, it is not 671 straightforward to determine this parameter from a nOE 672 buildup curve as the dynamics are compounded by cross673 relaxation and longitudinal relaxation (see eq 3). For this 674 purpose, we measured the T1 relaxation rates for all the 675 resonances in the lead oleate complex (see Supporting 676 Information Section S4.2 for the tabulated values). Such an 677 analysis yielded values for RL that vary between 0.6 and 2.5 s\u22121, 678 with the relaxation of the methyl group being the slowest. 679 During fitting (to eq 3), we allowed RL to vary between these 680 limits. We found that, apart from the cross-peak associated 681 with the methyl resonance (I6\u22121), all resonances can be well682 described with a fixed RL of 2.5 s\u22121 and yield a set of fit t3 683 parameters listed in Table 3. In Figure 5b, we map the cross684 relaxation rate RC, corresponding with the spin transfer from 685 the polarized alkene resonance 6 to other resonances j in the 686 chain, as a function of the number of bonds spaced between 687 the alkene protons and the protons of resonance j. In line with 688 intuition, polarization transfer happens faster to resonances in\n689closer proximity to the alkene protons (e.g., to the \u03b1-CH2, see 690marker 6\u22124). Besides, the trend appears linear, a finding 691hinting at a cascade mechanism. As we expect a larger transfer 692to resonances that contain more hydrogen nuclei, we plot the 693prefactor C6j in eq 3 to the number of hydrogen nuclei in 694resonance j. In this way, we obtain a linear plot with a slope of 6950.023, corresponding with a transfer of 2.3% per hydrogen 696nuclei or a total polarization transfer of 74%. Note that this 697value agrees well with the sum of the prefactors listed in Table 6983. Although these numbers are slightly lower than the 699predicted value of 94%, their high value suggests that every 700ligand in the dispersion contributes to the negative nOE 701buildup while lead oleate rapidly exchanges between a free and 702a bound state during the mixing phase. 703An NMR toolbox analysis and a more detailed analysis using 704nOE build curves unambiguously showed that lead oleate is 705dynamically interacting with the surface, fastly exchanging 706between a free and a bound state. Because of the dynamic 707nature of such a bond, stable dispersions could only be 708obtained in the presence of an excess of the lead oleate"

Nonetheless, by supplying an excess of a metal 710 carboxylate that acts as a Lewis acid, we can stabilize c-MoS2 711 NCs in more conventional and apolar solvents such as toluene.\n712 \u25a0 CONCLUSION 713 Reasoning from the observation that the colloidal stability of c714 MoS2 is heavily dependent on the solvent choice, we screened 715 the stability of colloidal MoS2 nanosheets in a wide range of 716 solvents. Similar to van der Waals solids produced by LPE, we 717 show that colloidal stability can be understood from solution 718 thermodynamics, where the solubility parameter of the solvent 719 is an apt descriptor to predict the colloidal stability of c-MoS2 720 nanosheets. More specifically, we found that the most optimal 721 solvents are characterized by a solubility parameter of 21.5 \u00b1 722 0.3 MPa1/2. Such values are attained by aromatic solvents with 723 polar groups, such as o-dichlorobenzene, or even polar aprotic 724 solvents, such as DMF. These findings are complemented by 725 NMR analyses, which demonstrated that ligands, such as 726 oleylamine and oleic acid, have a minimal affinity toward the 727 NC surface and engage in a highly dynamic adsorption/ 728 desorption equilibrium. We thus conclude that hot injection 729 yields c-MoS2 nanosheets with comparable interfaces as those 730 produced by LPE, where colloidal stability of dispersions and 731 inks is linked to a matching of the solvent and nanomaterial 732 solubility parameters. This finding might offer the prospect of 733 using established procedures developed for LPE nanomaterials 734 for postprocessing of colloidally synthesized TMD dispersions 735 as processable inks.\n736 \u25a0 ASSOCIATED CONTENT 737 *s\u0131 Supporting Information 738 The Supporting Information is available free of charge at 739 https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.langmuir.3c00546. 740 Additional information on the colloidal synthesis of few741 layer c-MoS2 nanosheets, the stabilization of c-MoS2 742 nanosheets by solvent interactions, the dynamic ligand 743 passivation of as-synthesized c-MoS2 nanosheets, and 744 the dynamic passivation of c-MoS2 nanosheets by Lewis 745 acids (PDF)\n746 \u25a0 AUTHOR INFORMATION 747 Corresponding Authors 748 Pieter Schiettecatte \u2212 Physics and Chemistry of 749 Nanostructures, Ghent University, Ghent 9000, Belgium; 750 Center for Nano and Biophotonics, Ghent University, Ghent 751 9000, Belgium; orcid.org/0000-0002-0178-413X; 752 Email: pjschiet.schiettecatte@ugent.be 753 Zeger Hens \u2212 Physics and Chemistry of Nanostructures, Ghent 754 University, Ghent 9000, Belgium; Center for Nano and 755 Biophotonics, Ghent University, Ghent 9000, Belgium; 756 orcid.org/0000-0002-7041-3375; Email: zeger.hens@ 757 ugent.be\n758 Authors 759 Shalini Singh \u2212 Department of Chemical Sciences, Unviersity 760 of Limerick, Limerick V94T9PX, Ireland; orcid.org/"
