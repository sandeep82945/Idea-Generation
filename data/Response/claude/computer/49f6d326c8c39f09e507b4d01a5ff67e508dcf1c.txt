 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the given paper:

1. Investigating the relationship between coronal hole expansion and the solar cycle. The paper hints at a possible link between coronal hole growth and the 11-year solar cycle. Further research with long-term data could uncover more definitive patterns tying coronal hole dynamics to different phases of the solar cycle. 

2. Developing physics-based models to simulate coronal hole evolution. Rather than relying solely on data-driven approaches, first-principles and magnetohydrodynamic models could provide insights into the underlying physics governing coronal hole formation, growth and decay. These models can complement data-driven techniques.

3. Studying the impacts of coronal hole geometry on solar wind streams. The shape and position of coronal holes likely influence the trajectories of resulting solar wind streams. Detailed modeling of different coronal hole shapes and orientations could uncover new relationships between geometry and solar wind propagation.

4. Incorporating real-time solar image data into predictive models. The availability of continuous solar image data from satellites like SDO offers the potential to make real-time predictions by feeding updated images into models. Exploring ways to leverage real-time data could enhance predictive capabilities.

5. Expanding predictions to other solar phenomena influenced by coronal holes. The insights from coronal hole modeling could be applied to improve forecasts of related events like geomagnetic storms, radio blackouts, and auroras. Developing holistic models covering coronal holes and their terrestrial impacts is an important next step.
