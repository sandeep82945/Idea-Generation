            "text": "The fast-developing era has witnessed the prevalence of cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), mostly originating from unhealthy lifestyles. CVDs have become the leading cause of global mortality and morbidity, heavily burdening society and patient families.1 A consensus has been reached that maintaining a healthy lifestyle greatly benets the prevention and control of the onset and progression of CVDs, while appropriate medical measures should be taken for people based on the progressive stages of diseases, including drug medication, interventional therapy, and vascular replacement.1,2 In the suffering populations, one that should be of special concern is those who urgently need small-diameter vascular gras (SDVGs) with an inner diameter of less than or equal to 6 mm to save their lives because this kind of gra on demand is still considerably insufficient in quantity.3\nEvery year, more than 1 million people urgently need SDVG surgeries globally to cure severe CVDs, such as coronary/carotid\nhou Province, Affiliated Hospital of Zunyi u, China.

In this context, pioneers have employed VGs as substitutions for natural blood vessels. Unlike large diameter VGs with an inner diameter larger than 6 mm used to replace large vessels (e.g., aorta) prepared by materials, such as ePTFE or PET, their small diameter counterparts with the same materials tend to have stenosis or occlusion.3,4 This is mainly attributed to the fact that slow blood ow in small vessels makes thrombogenic chemicals and cells more prone to aggregate on the lumen. Additionally, SDVGs experience complex biochemical and biomechanical environments under a blood owing physiological condition, further increasing their challenges in maintaining long-term patency.\nTo date, substantial advances have been made in the development of an eligible SDVG.5Nonetheless, the venue for success is rather slushy, and only few have crossed pre-clinical stages to enter clinical trials, yet none of them have hit the market so far.5 The main reasons are ascribed to thrombus formation, intimal hyperplasia (IH), and mechanical mismatches.6 Intensive strategies have been adopted to resolve or mitigate these issues, such as surface modication, cell coverage, and new substrate material usage.7 With the advancement of nanotechnology, NMs have entered the horizons of SDVG researchers and have exhibited enormous potential to improve SDVG performance.8 NMs are a set of materials with a scale ranging from one to several hundred nanometers in at least one dimension.

Various NMs have enhanced the performance of SDVGs by their benecial functions,8 which include improving EC adhesion, regulating inammation, mimicking vascular ECM, controllably releasing vasoactive drugs, and rening mechanical properties. Although the application of NMs in SDVGs is generally underexplored, they have shown great promise in boosting the development of SDVGs. In this review, we summarize the state-of-the-art applications of NMs in SDVGs and discuss future perspectives of this new eld."

For VGs, it has been reported that vascular patches made of decellularized porcine aorta conjugated with mercaptoethylaminefunctionalized AuNPs showed ne patency in longitudinal arteriotomy models of pigs. The AuNPs enhanced the tissue integration and EC and SMC regeneration, as well as decreased inammation and scaffold degradation, compared with the commercially available bovine pericardium material control aer the patches were implanted in carotis12 or thoracic aorta13 from 2 to 6 months. This is partially because AuNPs hinder collagenase binding sites.11,14,15 The possible disadvantage of AuNPs in VGs may arise from their undetermined long-term metabolism behavior and safe concentration range, which needs to be determined. The utilization of AuNPs in VGs is in a very early stage because important properties, such as antibacteria, photothermal/electronic effect, and drug delivery of AuNPs, are still unexploited. Furthermore, AuNP sizes, shapes (e.g., nanospheres, nanorods, and nanostars), and surface modifying groups highly affect their tissue reactions, which should therefore be carefully evaluated in VG applications."

For instance, human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were incubated with carboxydextran-coated Fe3O4 NPs and then seeded on a polytetrauorethylene (PTFE) VG lumen homogeneously under the guidance of an annular magnetic eld. In addition to the rapidness of construction, cell arrangements of the cell-seeded VG could be sensed non-invasively using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).19 In another study, vascular ECs, SMCs, and broblasts (FBs) were separately incubated with Fe3O4 NPs encapsulated in cationic liposomes to form cell sheets on at magnets, and then the sheets were rolled layer-by-layer around a cylindrical magnet to construct a cell distribution mimicking multilayered VG.20 This method can rapidly and conveniently prepare structurally mimetic VGs. In a third study, researchers rst establishedmagnetic tissue spheroid units around 200 mm in diameter, each of which contained two coterminal domains: one was cell aggregates assembled by one type of vascular cells (ECs, SMCs, or FBs), while the other was collagen gel encapsulating Fe3O4 NPs.21 To rapidly complete a biomimetic VG, the magnetic units rst formed at rectangle stripes under the guidance of at magnets, and the stripes were then wrapped layer by layer around cylinder magnets. However, all the three VGs were proof of concept models, and their in vivo performances had not been validated. In addition, the long-term and in vivo safety of Fe3O4 NPs in these VGs were still questionable although a safe dose range of 10\u2013200 mg mL\u22121 was identied by short-time cell tests and measures; for example, separating cell and NP containing domains were used to lower the risk of toxicity in the above cases.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

By tuning the working conditions, ES can well control the ber size and orientation, scaffold conguration (2D lms or 3D geometry in designated shapes) and surface thickness. ES substrates are typically versatile scaffold materials in VGs, which can load drugs and control cell behaviors.50,51 There have been several examples of ES-based VGs in the previous texts in this review, e.g., VGs by ZnO NPcoated P(VDF-TrFE) ES conduits24 and by human placental MSC-derived EV-modied ES PCL conduits.42 Intensive and comprehensive reviews on this topic have been published (see ref. 52\u201355). Herein, we provide another latest example of interest. The VG was fabricated by decorating a C-type natriuretic peptide (CNP), a vasodilator, on PCL ES tubular scaffolds (Fig. 5B).56 The VG showed great blood compatibility in a rabbit arterial venous (AV)-shunt model for 1.5 hours of the test. One month post-implantation in a rat abdominal aorta replacement model, compared to its counterpart without CNPs, the CNP loaded with VGs showed signicantly more EC coverage, NO production, VEGF secretion, M2 type macrophage polarization, contractile SMC transition, and ECM deposition, along with a parallel yet also 100% patency rate. Therefore, the CNP decoration further improved the regenerative capacity of the VG, which may play an important role in long-term VG patency. However, the in vivo test should be performed at an elongated time. In addition, the slow degradation of PCL polymers may cause the calcication and degeneration of vascular neotissues. To achieve ideal VGs, it is a critical issue for ES-based VGs to select the proper polymer material, construct the proper ber size and orientation, and decorate proper seeding cells and/or coatings."

It is noteworthy that in this VG, numerical simulation was successfully employed to predict the performance of its surface nanopatterns. Therefore, more efficient nanopatterns can be designed through computers. The major difficulty of this strategy arises from precise manufacturing techniques."

            "text": "The major efforts of SDVGs are to reverse the dilemma that surgeons clearly know the gold treatment to cure diseases but lack available gras to save more lives. NMs have opened a new door for enhancing the performance of vascular gras although the application of NMs in SDVGs is still in its infancy. As listed in Table 1, NMs in the forms of nanoparticles, nanobers, nanolms, or some of these in combination have been utilized for SDVG patency improvement, regeneration promotion, rapid construction, non-invasive imaging, and so forth. Each kind of material has its advantages and disadvantages. Thus, it is\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nimportant to rationally use a specic material according to the target goal. Because all these NMs have represented a certain effectiveness in VGs, safety is the fundamental issue to be considered in the VG application. In this context, the Ta nanolms, nanopatterns, and distinct nanobers tested practically or experimentally perform well. For NPs, in general, the safest ones are biologically derived EVs with the highest biocompatibility; the safety of organically synthetic ones takes second place, which should be further identied; and the safety of inorganically synthetic ones is even lower, which should be carefully evaluated for further applications, although combining inorganic NPs and organic substrates demonstrates a new direction that improves VG performance. High safety means high translational potential. However, the effectiveness of the NMs in VGs could be continuously improved by structural redesign, surface modication, chemical treatment, a combination of various NMs, and so forth. Moreover, it is worth noting that the aforementioned VGs include not only the fabrication or renement of newly designed synthetic VGs (the major efforts in the SDVG eld currently) but also the amelioration of gold-standard and traditional material-based ones.\nBy scanning the huge NM pool, many NMs potentially applicable to SDVGs are to be discovered. For example, silver NPs were linked to porous PCL lms, which showed potent effects in inhibiting platelet adhesion and aggregation in vitro, simultaneously retaining the inherent antimicrobial properties of the NPs.72\u201374 An alternative nanomaterial, plasma-modied TiO2 nanotube coating, has been widely used in cardiovascular stents and other biomedical devices. Researchers have found that the coating can enhance endothelial coverage but reduce platelet adhesion and unfavorable SMC propagation. Interestingly, the coating also exhibited good anti-infective capacity.75 Although they have not been directly applied, NMs have shown powerful potential in improving SDVG patency.76 It is noteworthy that owing to the shared targeting organ systems and disease mechanisms with small diameter vascular diseases, NMs used in the management of atherosclerosis and other cardiovascular diseases (e.g., NMs in vascular or heart stents) could enhance the utilization of NMs in SDVGs (see several excellent reviews on this topic77\u201380).\nIn our opinion, there are several future studies on improving NM-bearing SDVGs. First, as aforementioned, only very few NMs have been tested in the SDVGs in the context of the exploding development of thousands of NMs.71 An item that could be immediately executed is the discovery of more currently available NMs that can be used in SDVGs. Second, owing to the strong designability of NMs, we can construct new NMs for SDVG based on our particular goal. It is suggested that in the design, the target should be considered systematically because the reasons for the low patency are closely interconnected. Multi-cargo carrying and precisely targeting NMs may be helpful. Third, the long-term and systematic impact of NMs on SDVGs should be evaluated to obtain more reliable conclusions to promote clinical translation. NM functions, distributions, and toxicities are all essential parts of the safety and efficacy of the NM-bearing VG. In the meantime, intrinsic limitations on eachmaterial should be overcomewith the development of science and technology. Finally, we noticed that\nNanoscale Adv., 2023, 5, 6751\u20136767 | 6763\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle . P\nub lis\nhe d\non 0\n6 N\nov em\nbe r\n20 23\n.

Although the incorporation of NMs into SDVGs may not be dominant, we believe that the outstanding particularity and utilization potential of NMs will illuminate the way ahead for achieving commercially available SDVGs and directing the SDVG into a new era."
