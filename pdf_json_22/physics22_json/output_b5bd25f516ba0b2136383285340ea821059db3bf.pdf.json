            "text": "For over a century, the canonical problem of diffraction by a penetrable wedge has attracted a great deal of attention in search for a clear analytical solution, which remains an open and challenging problem. Beyond their importance to mathematical physics as one of the building blocks of the geometrical theory of diffraction (1), wedge diffraction problems also have applications to climate change modelling, as they are related to the scattering of light waves by atmospheric particles such as ice crystals, which is one of the big uncertainties when calculating the Earth\u2019s radiation budget (see (2\u20135)).\nAn important parameter when studying the diffraction by a penetrable wedge is the contrast parameter \u03bb which is defined as the ratio of either the electric permittivities \u03b51,2, magnetic permeabilities \u03bc1,2, or densities \u03c11,2 corresponding to the material inside and outside the wedge, respectively, depending on the physical context, cf. section 2. The case of \u03bb 1 (high contrast) is, for instance, studied in (6) and (7). In (6), Lyalinov adapts the Sommerfeld\u2013Malyuzhinets technique to penetrable scatterers and concludes with a far-field approximation taking the geometrical optics components and the diffracted cylindrical waves into account whilst neglecting the lateral waves\u2019 contribution. More recently, in (7) Nethercote et al. provide a method to accurately and rapidly compute the far-field for high-contrast penetrable wedge diffraction taking the lateral waves\u2019 contribution into account, by using a combination of the Wiener\u2013Hopf and Sommerfeld\u2013 Malyuzhinets technique. The case of general contrast parameter \u03bb is for example considered by\n\u2020Corresponding author <valentin.kunz@manchester.ac.uk> \u2021raphael.assier@manchester.ac.uk\nQ. Jl Mech. Appl.

When the wedge has very small opening angle, Budaev and Bogy obtain a convergent Neumann series by using the Sommerfeld\u2013Malyuzhinets technique (10). All of these papers offer different ways to numerically compute the total wave field. Another, more theoretically oriented perspective on penetrable wedge diffraction when the wedge is right angled is provided by Meister, Penzel, Speck and Teixeira in (11), which follows an operator-theoretic approach and takes different interface conditions on the two faces of the wedge into account.\nThe present article studies the case of a no-contrast penetrable wedge. That is, we set \u03bb = 1. Moreover, we assume that the wedge is right angled. Previous work on this special case includes that of Radlow (12), Kraut and Lehmann (13) and Rawlins (14). References (12) and (13) are based on a two-complex-variable Wiener\u2013Hopf approach, whereas (14)\u2019s approach is based on Green\u2019s functions. In (12), Radlow gives a closed-form solution, but it was deemed erroneous by Kraut and Lehmann (13) as it led to the wrong corner asymptotics. Kraut and Lehmann assume that the wavenumbers inside and outside of the wedge are of similar size, and in (14), Rawlins extends their work by generalising (13)\u2019s scheme to arbitrary opening angles. A description of the diffraction coefficient is given in the right-angled case, in addition to the near-field description provided in (13). Moreover, in (15), Rawlins obtains the diffraction coefficient for penetrable wedges with arbitrary angles. Both (14) and (15) require the wavenumbers inside and outside of the wedge to be of similar size. Another approach on the right-angled no-contrast wedge, that is based on physical optics approximations (also referred to as Kirchhoff approximation), is presented in (16) and (17). These papers modify the ansatz posed in (18), which extends classical physical optics (19) from perfect to penetrable scatterers.\nRecently, a correction term missing in Radlow\u2019s work was given by the authors in (20). This correction term includes an unknown spectral function and thus, the no-contrast right-angled penetrable wedge diffraction problem remains unsolved. The present work is part of an ongoing effort to apply multidimensional complex analysis to diffraction theory (20\u201326). Another approach, also exploiting interesting ideas of multidimensional analysis in the context of wedge diffraction, is given in the monograph (27) that also contains an excellent review of wedge diffraction problems.\nWe first reformulate the diffraction problem as a two-complex-variable functional problem in the spirit of (21) and prove that this functional formulation is indeed equivalent to the physical problem. Therefore, solving the functional problem would directly solve the diffraction problem at hand, which immediately motivates further study of the former. Specifically, we will endeavour to study the analytical continuation of the unknown (spectral) functions of the two-complexvariable Wiener\u2013Hopf equation (2.14). Indeed, not only is the knowledge of the spectral functions\u2019 domains of analyticity crucial for completing the classical (one-complex-variable) Wiener\u2013Hopf technique (cf. (28)), but by the recent work of Assier et al. (22), we know that knowledge of the spectral functions\u2019 singularities allows for computation of the physical fields\u2019 far-field asymptotics. Specifically, to obtain closed-form far-field asymptotics of the physical fields, which are represented as inverse double Fourier integrals as given in (2.20) and (2.21), we need to answer the following questions:\n1. What are the spectral functions\u2019 singularities in C2?\n2. How can we represent the spectral functions in the vicinity of these singularities?\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /qjm am /article/76/2/211/7199917 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nAddressing these questions, and thereby building the framework that allows us to make further progress, is the main endeavour of the present article. Note that, at this point, it is not clear how the two-complex-variable Wiener\u2013Hopf equation can be solved and generalising the Wiener\u2013Hopf technique to two or more dimensions remains a challenging practical and theoretical task. We refer to the introduction of (21) for a comprehensive overview of the Wiener\u2013Hopf technique and the difficulties with its generalisation to two-complex-variables.\nThe content of the present article is organised as follows. After formulating the physical problem in section 2.1 and rewriting it as a two-complex-variable functional problem involving the unknown spectral functions \u2018 ++\u2019 and \u2018 3/4\u2019 in section 2.2, the equivalence of these two formulations is proved in Theorem 2.5. Thereafter, in section 3, we will study the analytical continuation of the spectral functions in the spirit of (21). Using integral representation formulae given in section 3.2, we unveil the spectral functions\u2019 singularities in C2, as well as their local behaviour near those singularities, in sections 3.4 and 3.5. Throughout sections 2\u20133.5, we assume positive imaginary part of the wavenumbers k1 and k2, and in section 3.6, we discuss the spectral functions\u2019 singularities on R2 in the limit Im(k1,2) \u2192 0. Finally, in section 4, we show that the novel additive crossing property (introduced in (21)) holds for the spectral function 3/4 at intersections of its branch sets. This property is critical to obtaining the correct far-field asymptotics (see (22)) and will lead to the final spectral reformulation of the physical problem, as given in section 4.2."

            "text": "2.1 Formulation of the physical problem\nWe are considering the problem of diffraction of a plane wave \u03c6in incident on an infinite, right angled penetrable wedge, PW, given by\nPW = {(x1, x2) \u2208 R2| x1 \u2265 0, x2 \u2265 0}, see Fig. 1 (left).\nWe assume transparency of the wedge and thus expect a scattered field \u03c6sc in R2 \\ PW and a transmitted field \u03c8 in PW. Moreover, we assume time-harmonicity with the e\u2212i\u03c9t convention. Therefore, the wave-fields\u2019 dynamics are described by two Helmholtz equations, and the incident wave (only supported within R2 \\ PW) is given by\n\u03c6in(x) = eik1\u00b7x\nFig. 1 Left: Illustration of the problem described by (2.1)\u2013(2.4).

Additionally, we are describing a no-contrast penetrable wedge, meaning that the contrast parameter \u03bb satisfies \u03bb = 1. In the electromagnetic setting, this assumption would correspond to either \u03bc1 = \u03bc2 (electric polarisation) or 1 = 2 (magnetic polarisation) where \u03bc1 and \u03bc2 (resp. 1 and 2) are the magnetic permeability of the media in R2 \\ PW and PW (resp. the electric permittivities of the media in R\n2 \\ PW and PW). In the acoustic setting, this assumption corresponds to \u03c11 = \u03c12, where \u03c11 and \u03c12 are the densities of the media (at rest) in R2 \\ PW and PW, respectively.\nLet k1 = |k1| = c1/\u03c9 and k2 = c2/\u03c9 denote the wavenumbers inside and outside PW, respectively, where c1 and c2 are the wave speeds relative to the media in R2 \\ PW and PW, respectively. In the electromagnetic setting, cj, j = 1, 2 corresponds to the speed of light whereas in the acoustic setting, cj corresponds to the speed of sound. Although \u03bb = 1, the wavenumbers are different (k1 = k2) since the other media properties defining the speeds of light (in the electromagnetic setting) or sound (in the acoustic setting) are different. We refer to (20), Section 2.1 for a more detailed discussion of the physical context.\nSetting \u03c6 = \u03c6sc + \u03c6in (the total wave field in R2 \\ PW), and letting n denote the inward pointing normal on \u2202PW, the diffraction problem at hand is then described by the following equations.\n\u03c6 + k21\u03c6 = 0 in R2 \\ PW, (2.1) \u03c8 + k22\u03c8 = 0 in PW, (2.2)\n\u03c6 = \u03c8 on \u2202PW, (2.3) \u2202n\u03c6 = \u2202n\u03c8 on \u2202PW. (2.4)\nIn the electromagnetic setting, \u03c6 and \u03c8 correspond either to the electric or magnetic field (depending on the polarisation of the incident wave, cf. (12, 13)) in R2 \\ PW and PW, respectively, whereas in the acoustic setting, \u03c6 and \u03c8 represent the total pressure inR2 \\PW and PW, respectively.\nEquations (2.1) and (2.2) are the problem\u2019s governing equations, describing the fields\u2019 dynamics, whereas the boundary conditions (2.3)\u2013(2.4) impose continuity of the fields and their normal derivatives at the wedge\u2019s boundary. Introducing polar coordinates (r, \u03d1) (cf. Fig. 1, middle), we rewrite the incident wave vector as k1 = \u2212k1(cos(\u03d10), sin(\u03d10)), where \u03d10 is the incident angle. The incident wave can then be rewritten as\n\u03c6in = e\u2212i(a1x1+a2x2) (2.5) with\na1 = k1 cos(\u03d10) and a2 = k1 sin(\u03d10). (2.6) Henceforth, as usual when working in a Wiener\u2013Hopf setting, we assume that the wave numbers have small positive imaginary part Im(k1) = Im(k2) > 0 which, since we assumed time harmonicity with the e\u2212i\u03c9t convention, corresponds to the damping of waves. Note that the imaginary parts of k1 and k2 may be chosen independently of each other, but this does not matter in the present context.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /qjm am /article/76/2/211/7199917 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nIn section 3.6, we will investigate the limit Im(k1,2) \u2192 0. Moreover, for technical reasons, we have to restrict the incident angle \u03d10 \u2208 (\u03c0, 3\u03c0/2), which implies\nIm(a1,2) \u2264 \u2212\u03b4 < 0\nfor\n\u03b4 = min{Im(k1)| cos(\u03d10)|, Im(k1)| sin(\u03d10)|}. (2.7)\nThis condition on the incident angle is rather restrictive since it says that the field cannot produce secondary reflected and transmitted waves as the incident wave is coming from the Q3-region (see Fig. 1, middle and right). However, we will work around this restriction in section 3.6 as long as \u03c6in is incident from within Q2 \u222a Q3 \u222a Q4. For an incident wave coming from within Q1 = PW, the following analysis has to be repeated separately.\nFor the problem to be well posed, we also require the fields to satisfy the Sommerfeld radiation condition, meaning that the wave field should be outgoing in the far-field, and edge conditions called \u2018Meixner conditions\u2019, ensuring finiteness of the wave field\u2019s energy near the tip. The radiation condition is imposed via the limiting absorption principle on the scattered and transmitted fields: For Im(k1,2) > 0, \u03c6sc and \u03c8 decay exponentially. The edge conditions are given by\n\u03c6(r, \u03d1) = B + (A1 sin(\u03d1) + B1 cos(\u03d1)) r + O(r2) as r \u2192 0, (2.8) \u03c8(r, \u03d1) = B + (A1 sin(\u03d1) + B1 cos(\u03d1)) r + O(r2) as r \u2192 0. (2.9)\nWe refer to (20) Section 2.1 for a more detailed discussion. Note that (2.8) and (2.9) are only valid when \u03bb = 1, and we refer to (7) for the general case. Finally, we note that specifying the behaviour of the fields near the wedge\u2019s tip and at infinity is required to guarantee unique solvability of the problem described by (2.1)\u2013(2.4), see (29).\n2.2 Formulation as functional problem\nLet Qn, n = 1, 2, 3, 4 denote the nth quadrant of the (x1, x2) plane given by\nPW =Q1 = {x \u2208 R2|x1 \u2265 0, x2 \u2265 0}, Q2 = {x \u2208 R2|x1 \u2264 0, x2 \u2265 0}, Q3 = {x \u2208 R2|x1 \u2264 0, x2 \u2264 0}, Q4 = {x \u2208 R2|x1 \u2265 0, x2 \u2264 0},\nsee Fig. 1 (right). The one-quarter Fourier transform of a function u is given by\nU1/4(\u03b1) = F1/4[u](\u03b1) = \u222b\u222b\nQ1 u(x)ei\u03b1\u00b7xdx, (2.10)\nand a function\u2019s three-quarter Fourier transform is given by\nU3/4(\u03b1) = F3/4[u](\u03b1) = \u222b\u222b\n\u222a4i=2Qi u(x)ei\u03b1\u00b7xdx. (2.11)\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /qjm am /article/76/2/211/7199917 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nHere, we have \u03b1 = (\u03b11, \u03b12) \u2208 C2 and we write dx for dx1dx2. Analysis of where inC2 the variable \u03b1 is permitted to go will be this article\u2019s main endeavour. Applying F1/4 to (2.1) and F3/4 to (2.2), using the boundary conditions (2.3)\u2013(2.4) and setting\n3/4(\u03b1) = F3/4[\u03c6sc], ++(\u03b1) = F1/4[\u03c8], (2.12)\nP++(\u03b1) = 1 (\u03b11 \u2212 a1)(\u03b12 \u2212 a2) , K(\u03b1) = k22 \u2212 \u03b121 \u2212 \u03b122 k21 \u2212 \u03b121 \u2212 \u03b122 , (2.13)\nthe following Wiener\u2013Hopf equation is derived after a lengthy but straightforward calculation (see (20) Appendix A):\n\u2212K(\u03b1) ++(\u03b1) = 3/4(\u03b1) + P++(\u03b1), (2.14) which is valid in the product S \u00d7 S of strips\nS = {\u03b1 \u2208 C| \u2212 \u03b5 < Im(\u03b1) < \u03b5} (2.15) for\n\u03b5 = 1 2 min{\u03b4, Im(k2)}. (2.16)\nHere, \u03b4 is as in (2.7) and since we chose Im(k1) = Im(k2), we have, in fact, \u03b5 = \u03b4/2. Remark 2.1 (Similarity to quarter-plane) The Wiener\u2013Hopf equation (2.14) is formally the same as the Wiener\u2013Hopf equation for the quarter-plane diffraction problem discussed in (21). Indeed, the only difference is due to the kernel K, which for the quarter-plane is given by K = 1/ \u221a k2 \u2212 \u03b121 \u2212 \u03b122, where k is the (only) wavenumber of the quarter-plane problem (cf. (20) Remark 2.6). We will encounter this aspect throughout the remainder of the article, and, consequently, most of our formulae and results only differ from those given in (21) by K\u2019s behaviour (its factorisation, see section 3.1, and the factorisation\u2019s domains of analyticity; see section 3.3, for instance). Though the two problems are similar in their spectral formulation, they are very different physically. Indeed, the quarter-plane problem is inherently three-dimensional and its far-field consists of a spherical wave emanating from the corner, some primary and secondary edge diffracted waves as well as a reflected plane wave (see for example (30)), while the far-field of the two-dimensional (2D) penetrable wedge problem considered here consists of primary and secondary reflected and transmitted plane waves, some cylindrical waves emanating from the corner, as well as some lateral waves.\n2.2.1 1/4-based and 3/4-based functions. The 2D Wiener\u2013Hopf equation (2.14) contains two unknown \u2018spectral\u2019 functions, ++ and 3/4. In the spirit of (21), our aim is to convert the physical problem discussed in section 2.1 into a formulation in 2D Fourier space, similar to the traditional Wiener\u2013Hopf procedure. For this, the properties of the Wiener\u2013Hopf equation\u2019s unknowns are of fundamental importance. Following (21), we call these properties 1/4-basedness and 3/4-basedness.\nDefinition 2.2. A function F(\u03b1) in two complex variables is called 1/4-based if there exists a function f : Q1 \u2192 C such that\nF(\u03b1) = F1/4[f ](\u03b1),\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /qjm am /article/76/2/211/7199917 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nand it is called 3/4-based, if there exists a function f : R2 \\ Q1 \u2192 C such that\nF(\u03b1) = F3/4[f ](\u03b1).\nMoreover, we set for any x0 \u2208 R\nUHP(x0) = {z \u2208 C| Im(z) > x0}, LHP(x0) = {z \u2208 C| Im(z) < x0},\nand UHP = UHP(0), LHP = LHP(0). In (20), it was shown that ++ is analytic in UHP(\u22122\u03b5) \u00d7 UHP(\u22122\u03b5), where \u03b5 > 0 is as in (2.16). This is indeed a criterion for 1/4-basedness, that is if a function is analytic in UHP \u00d7 UHP, then it is 1/4-based, see (21). However, although a function analytic in LHP \u00d7 LHP is 3/4-based, the unknown function 3/4 is, in general, not analytic in LHP \u00d7 LHP (see (21) and section 3.5) and therefore this does not seem to be a criterion useful to diffraction theory. Instead, the correct criterion for the quarter-plane involves the novel concept of additive crossing, see (21), and analysing this phenomenon for the penetrable wedge diffraction problem is one of the main endeavours of the present article. Remark 2.3. Although ++ is analytic within UHP(\u22122\u03b5) \u00d7 UHP(\u22122\u03b5), we shall, for simplicity, henceforth just work with \u03b5 instead of 2\u03b5. That is, we write that ++ is analytic within UHP(\u2212\u03b5) \u00d7 UHP(\u2212\u03b5), bearing in mind that this a priori domain of analyticity can be slightly extended. 2.2.2 Asymptotic behaviour of spectral functions. Before we can reformulate the physical problem of section 2.1 as a functional problem similar to the 1D Wiener\u2013Hopf procedure, we require information about the asymptotic behaviour of the unknowns ++ and 3/4. This will not only be crucial to recover the Meixner conditions, but it will also be of fundamental importance for all of sections 3 and 4.\nIn (20) Appendix B, it was shown that the spectral functions satisfy the following \u2018spectral edge conditions\u2019. For fixed \u03b1 2 (resp. fixed \u03b1 1) in UHP(\u2212\u03b5) we have\n++(\u03b11, \u03b1 2) = O(1/|\u03b11|), as |\u03b11| \u2192 \u221e in UHP(\u2212\u03b5) (2.17) ++(\u03b1 1, \u03b12) = O(1/|\u03b12|), as |\u03b12| \u2192 \u221e in UHP(\u2212\u03b5) (2.18)\nand, if neither variable is fixed,\n++(\u03b11, \u03b12) =O(1/|\u03b11||\u03b12|) as |\u03b11| \u2192 \u221e, |\u03b12| \u2192 \u221e in UHP(\u2212\u03b5). (2.19)\nSimilarly, the function 3/4 satisfies the growth estimates (2.17)\u2013(2.19) as |\u03b11,2| \u2192 \u221e in S \u00d7 S . 2.2.3 Reformulation of the physical problem. Using the results above, we can rewrite the physical problem given by (2.1)\u2013(2.4) as the following functional problem.\nDefinition 2.4. Let P++ and K be as in (2.13). We say that two functions ++ and 3/4 in the variable \u03b1 \u2208 C2 satisfy the \u2018penetrable wedge functional problem\u2019 if 1. \u2212K(\u03b1) ++(\u03b1) = 3/4(\u03b1) + P++(\u03b1) for all \u03b1 \u2208 S \u00d7 S; 2. ++ is analytic in UHP(\u2212\u03b5) \u00d7 UHP(\u2212\u03b5);\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /qjm am /article/76/2/211/7199917 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\n3. 3/4 is 3/4-based;\n4. ++ and 3/4 satisfy the \u2018spectral edge conditions\u2019 given in section 2.2.2.\nThe importance of Definition 2.4 stems from the following theorem, which proves the equivalence of the penetrable wedge functional problem and the physical problem discussed in section 2.1.\nTheorem 2.5. If a pair of functions ++, 3/4 satisfies the conditions of Definition 2.4, then the functions \u03c6sc and \u03c8 given by\n\u03c6sc(x) = 1 4\u03c02 \u222b\u222b R2 3/4(\u03b1)e \u2212i\u03b1\u00b7xd\u03b1, (2.20)\n\u03c8(x) = 1 4\u03c02 \u222b\u222b R2 ++(\u03b1)e\u2212i\u03b1\u00b7xd\u03b1, (2.21)\nsatisfy the penetrable wedge problem described by (2.1)\u2013(2.4) for an incident wave given by \u03c6in = exp(\u2212i(a1x1 + a2x2)). Proof. Since ++ is 1/4-based, there exists a function \u03c81/4 : PW \u2192 C with F1/4(\u03c81/4) = ++ and similarly, there exists a function \u03c63/4 : R2 \\ PW \u2192 C with 3/4 = F3/4(\u03c63/4). If we now set \u03c81/4 \u2261 0 on R2 \\ PW and \u03c63/4 \u2261 0 on PW we obtain ++ = F(\u03c81/4) and 3/4 = F(\u03c63/4) where F = F1/4 + F3/4 is just the usual 2D Fourier-transform. But then, by uniqueness of the inverse Fourier-transform, we find \u03c8 = \u03c81/4 and \u03c6sc = \u03c63/4. In particular, \u03c8 \u2261 0 on R2 \\ PW and \u03c6sc \u2261 0 on PW. Now, by direct calculation using (2.14), (2.20) and (2.21), we find\n\u03c6sc + k21\u03c6sc = \u03c8 + k22\u03c8. (2.22) But since \u03c8 \u2261 0 on R2 \\ PW and \u03c6sc \u2261 0 on PW, we find that (2.22) can only be satisfied if both sides of this equation vanish identically on R2. In particular,\n\u03c6sc + k21\u03c6sc = 0 in R2 \\ PW, (2.23) \u03c8 + k22\u03c8 = 0 in PW. (2.24)\nSince the incident wave always satisfies (2.1), by setting \u03c6 = \u03c6in + \u03c6sc, we have recovered the Helmholtz equations (2.1) and (2.2). To recover the boundary conditions (2.3)\u2013(2.4), write\nK(\u03b1) = K2(\u03b1) K1(\u03b1) , for K2(\u03b1) = k22 \u2212 \u03b121 \u2212 \u03b122 and K1(\u03b1) = k21 \u2212 \u03b121 \u2212 \u03b122 . (2.25)\nBy a direct computation using Green\u2019s theorem (cf. (20)), we have\nF3/4[ \u03c6sc + k21\u03c6sc] = \u2212 K1(\u03b1) 3/4(\u03b1) + \u222b \u2202PW (\u2202n\u03c6sc)e i\u03b1\u00b7xdl \u2212 \u222b \u2202PW \u03c6sc ( \u2202ne i\u03b1\u00b7x) dl, (2.26) F1/4[ \u03c8 + k22\u03c8] = \u2212 K2(\u03b1) ++(\u03b1) \u2212 \u222b \u2202PW (\u2202n\u03c8)e i\u03b1\u00b7xdl + \u222b \u2202PW \u03c8 ( \u2202ne\ni\u03b1\u00b7x) dl. (2.27) And since by (2.23)\u2013(2.24)\nF3/4[ \u03c6sc + k21\u03c6sc] = F1/4[ \u03c8 + k22\u03c8] = 0\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /qjm am /article/76/2/211/7199917 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nwe have by (2.26)\u2013(2.27)\nK1(\u03b1) 3/4(\u03b1) = \u222b \u2202PW (\u2202n\u03c6sc)e i\u03b1\u00b7xdl \u2212 \u222b \u2202PW \u03c6sc ( \u2202ne i\u03b1\u00b7x) dl, (2.28) K2(\u03b1) ++(\u03b1) = \u2212 \u222b \u2202PW (\u2202n\u03c8)e i\u03b1\u00b7xdl + \u222b \u2202PW \u03c8 ( \u2202ne\ni\u03b1\u00b7x) dl. (2.29) Therefore, the Wiener\u2013Hopf equation (2.14) yields\n\u2212K1(\u03b1)P++(\u03b1) = K1(\u03b1) 3/4(\u03b1) + K2(\u03b1) ++(\u03b1)\n= \u222b \u2202PW (\u2202n(\u03c6sc \u2212 \u03c8))ei\u03b1\u00b7xdl \u2212 \u222b \u2202PW (\u03c6sc \u2212 \u03c8) ( \u2202ne i\u03b1\u00b7x) dl.

(2.31) Thus, combining (2.30) and (2.31), we have\n0 = \u222b \u221e\n0 ((\u2202x1\u03c6)(0\n\u2212, x2) \u2212 (\u2202x1\u03c8)(0+, x2))ei\u03b12x2 dx2\n+ \u222b \u221e\n0 ((\u2202x2\u03c6)(x1, 0\n\u2212) \u2212 (\u2202x2\u03c8)(x1, 0+))ei\u03b11x1 dx1\n\u2212 i\u03b11 \u222b \u221e\n0 (\u03c6(0\u2212, x2) \u2212 \u03c8(0+, x2))ei\u03b12x2 dx2 \u2212 i\u03b12 \u222b \u221e 0 (\u03c6(x1, 0 \u2212) \u2212 \u03c8(x1, 0+))ei\u03b11x1 dx1,\n(2.32)\nand the proof is complete by Theorem A.1, which implies that each integrand of the integrals in (2.32) has to be zero. Note that Theorem A.1 can be applied due to the far-field decay of the integrands (cf. (20) Section 2.3.3) and the Meixner conditions. Remark 2.6 (Asymptotic behaviour) Again, the Sommerfeld radiation condition is satisfied due to the positive imaginary part of k1,2 and, by the Abelian theorem (cf. (31)), the Meixner conditions hold due to the assumed asymptotic behaviour of the spectral functions."

To unveil ++ and 3/4\u2019s singularity structure, we follow (21), wherein the domains of analyticity of the two-complex-variable spectral functions to the quarter-plane problem are studied (which, as mentioned in Remark 2.1, is surprisingly similar to the penetrable wedge problem studied in the present article).\n3.1 Some useful functions Let \u2192 \u221a\nz denote the square root with branch cut on the positive real axis, and with branch determined by \u2192 \u221a 1 = 1 (that is arg(z) \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0 )). In particular, Im( \u2192\u221az) \u2265 0 for all z and Im( \u2192\u221az) = 0 if, and only if, z \u2208 (0,\u221e). As shown in (20), the kernel K defined in (2.13) admits the following factorisation in the \u03b11-plane\nK(\u03b1) = K+\u25e6(\u03b1)K\u2212\u25e6(\u03b1), (3.1) where\nK+\u25e6(\u03b1) = \u2192 \u221a\nk22 \u2212 \u03b122 + \u03b11 \u2192 \u221a\nk21 \u2212 \u03b122 + \u03b11 , K\u2212\u25e6(\u03b1) =\n\u2192 \u221a\nk22 \u2212 \u03b122 \u2212 \u03b11 \u2192 \u221a\nk21 \u2212 \u03b122 \u2212 \u03b11 , (3.2)\nand the functions K+\u25e6 and K\u2212\u25e6 are analytic in UHP(\u2212\u03b5) \u00d7 S and LHP(\u03b5) \u00d7 S , respectively, for \u03b5 as in (2.16).1 Analogously, we may choose to factorise in the \u03b12-plane:\nK(\u03b1) = K\u25e6+(\u03b1)K\u25e6\u2212(\u03b1) (3.3) where\nK\u25e6+(\u03b1) = \u2192 \u221a\nk22 \u2212 \u03b121 + \u03b12 \u2192 \u221a\nk21 \u2212 \u03b121 + \u03b12 , K\u25e6\u2212(\u03b1) =\n\u2192 \u221a\nk22 \u2212 \u03b121 \u2212 \u03b12 \u2192 \u221a\nk21 \u2212 \u03b121 \u2212 \u03b12 , (3.4)\nwhere K\u25e6+ and K\u25e6\u2212 are analytic in S \u00d7 UHP(\u2212\u03b5) and S \u00d7 LHP(\u03b5), respectively. See (20) for a visualisation of \u2192 \u221a z, \u2192 \u221a k2j \u2212 z2, j = 1, 2, and K\u00b1\u25e6 using phase portraits in the spirit of (32).\n3.2 Primary formulae for analytical continuation\nUsing the kernel\u2019s factorisation given in section 3.1, we have the following analytical continuation formulae:\nTheorem 3.1. For \u03b1 \u2208 S \u00d7 S , we have\n++(\u03b1) = 1 4\u03c02K\u25e6+(\u03b1) \u222b \u221e\u2212i\u03b5 \u2212\u221e\u2212i\u03b5 \u222b \u221e+i\u03b5 \u2212\u221e+i\u03b5 K(z1, z2) ++(z1, z2) K\u25e6\u2212(\u03b11, z2)(z2 \u2212 \u03b12)(z1 \u2212 \u03b11)dz1dz2\n1 In (20), it was proved that K\u2212\u25e6, say, is analytic in LHP(\u2212\u03b5\u0303) \u00d7 S, where \u03b5\u0303 = min{\u03b5, min\u03b1 \u2192 \u221a\nk21 \u2212 \u03b12} but it can be shown that \u03b5\u0303 \u2265 \u03b5 for \u03b5 given by (2.16).\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /qjm am /article/76/2/211/7199917 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\n\u2212 P++(\u03b1) K\u25e6\u2212(\u03b11, a2)K\u25e6+(\u03b1) , (3.5)\n++(\u03b1) = 1 4\u03c02K+\u25e6(\u03b1) \u222b \u221e+i\u03b5 \u2212\u221e+i\u03b5 \u222b \u221e\u2212i\u03b5 \u2212\u221e\u2212i\u03b5 K(z1, z2) ++(z1, z2) K\u2212\u25e6(z1, \u03b12)(z2 \u2212 \u03b12)(z1 \u2212 \u03b11)dz1dz2\n\u2212 P++(\u03b1) K\u2212\u25e6(a1, \u03b12)K+\u25e6(\u03b1) . (3.6)\nHere, and for the remainder of the article, a1 and a2 are given by (2.6).\nThe theorem\u2019s proof is the exact same as the proof of the analytical continuation formulae for the quarter-plane problem (cf. (33)\u2013(34) and Appendix A in (21)) and hence omitted. Indeed, we can write 3/4 = \u2212+ + \u2212\u2212 + +\u2212 for functions \u2212+, \u2212\u2212 and +\u2212 analytic in LHP(\u03b5) \u00d7 UHP(\u2212\u03b5), LHP(\u03b5) \u00d7 LHP(\u03b5) and UHP(\u2212\u03b5) \u00d7 LHP(\u03b5), respectively (see (20) eq. (2.21)), and the analyticity properties of \u2212+, \u2212\u2212 and +\u2212 in these domains as well as the analyticity of ++ in UHP(\u2212\u03b5) \u00d7 UHP(\u2212\u03b5) are the only key points to finding (3.5) and (3.6), and these domains agree with those of the quarter-plane problem. The only difference of (3.5)\u2013(3.6) and the corresponding analytical continuation formulae in the quarter-plane problem is due to the difference of the kernel K, as discussed in Remark 2.1, and its factorisation.\nObserve that the variable on the LHS of (3.5)\u2013(3.6) is \u03b1 \u2208 S \u00d7 S . Since all terms involving \u03b1 on the equations\u2019 RHS are known explicitly, we can choose \u03b1 to belong to a domain much larger than S \u00d7 S , thus providing an analytical continuation of ++. This procedure will be discussed in the following sections.\nRemark 3.2. The double integrals in formulae (3.5) and (3.6) can be rewritten as one dimensional Cauchy integrals, as outlined in Appendix B. In the quarter-plane problem discussed in (21), such a simplification is not possible as the singularity of the kernel K is a branch-set, whereas in our case it is just a polar singularity. However, such simplifications of the integral formulae do not significantly simplify the analytical continuation procedure discussed in sections 3.4 and 3.5 and are hence omitted at this stage.\n3.3 Domains for analytical continuation\nFor x0 \u2208 R, let us define the domains H+(x0) \u2282 C and H\u2212(x0) \u2282 C as H+(x0) = UHP(x0) \\( h+1 \u222a h+2 ) and H\u2212(x0) = LHP(x0) \\ ( h\u22121 \u222a h\u22122 ) , where h+1 , h + 2 , h \u2212 1 and h \u2212 2 are the curves given by\nh\u2212j = { \u2212 \u2192 \u221a k2j \u2212 x2| x \u2208 R } , j = 1, 2, h+j = { \u2192 \u221a k2j \u2212 x2| x \u2208 R } , j = 1, 2.\nMoreover, we set H\u2212 = H\u2212(0), H+ = H+(0), see Fig. 2 for an illustration. By the properties of \u2192\u221az, and due to the positive imaginary part of k1 and k2 we indeed have h+j \u2208 UHP for j = 1, 2 and consequently h\u2212j \u2208 LHP j = 1, 2; see (21). Moreover, the following holds:\nLemma 3.3 ((21), Lemma 3.2) If z \u2208 C \\ (h\u22121 \u222a h\u22122 \u222a h+1 \u222a h+2 ), then \u2192 \u221a k2j \u2212 z2 \u2208 H+ for j = 1, 2.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /qjm am /article/76/2/211/7199917 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nFig. 2 Domains H\u2212 (middle), H+ (right), and contours P1,2 (left)\nNow, define the contours P1 and P2 as the boundaries of C \\ h\u22121 and C \\ h\u22122 , see Fig. 2. That is, for j = 1, 2, Pj is the contour \u2018starting at \u2212i\u221e\u2019 and moving up along h\u2212j \u2019s left side, up to \u2212kj, and then moving back towards \u2212i\u221e along h\u2212j \u2019s right side. Intuitively, Pj is just h\u2212j but \u2018keeps track\u2019 of which side h\u2212j was approached from. Set P = P1 \u222a P2. Remark 3.4. Formally, all of the following analysis is a priori only valid if the contours P1 and P2\ndo not cross the points \u2212k1 and \u2212k2, since these are branch points of \u2192 \u221a k21 \u2212 z2 and \u2192 \u221a\nk22 \u2212 z2, so we would have to account for an arbitrarily small circle of radius b0, say, enclosing \u2212k1 and \u2212k2, respectively. However, it is straightforward to show that all formulae remain valid as b0 \u2192 0, so we do not need to account for this technicality.\n3.4 First step of analytical continuation: analyticity properties of ++ Since, as already pointed out, the only difference between the present work and (21) is the structure of the kernel K and, therefore, the structure of the domains H+ and H\u2212, most of the following discussion very closely follows (21), and we will just sketch most of the details. The reader familiar with (21) may wish to skip to Theorem 3.11.\nLet us first analyse the integral term in (3.5). As in (21), by an application of Stokes\u2019 theorem, which tells us that it is possible to deform the surface of integration continuously without changing the value of the integral as long as no singularity is hit during the deformation (cf. (23)), it is possible to show that:\nLemma 3.5. For \u03b1 \u2208 LHP \u00d7 UHP, the integral term in (3.5) given by\nJ(\u03b1) = \u222b \u221e\u2212i\u03b5 \u2212\u221e\u2212i\u03b5 \u222b \u221e+i\u03b5 \u2212\u221e+i\u03b5 K(z1, z2) ++(z1, z2) K\u25e6\u2212(\u03b11, z2)(z2 \u2212 \u03b12)(z1 \u2212 \u03b11)dz1dz2 (3.7)\nsatisfies\nJ(\u03b1) = \u222b\u222b\nR2 K(z1, z2) ++(z1, z2) K\u25e6\u2212(\u03b11, z2)(z2 \u2212 \u03b12)(z1 \u2212 \u03b11)dz1dz2. (3.8)\nProof (Sketch of proof). For \u03b1 = (\u03b1 1, \u03b1 2) \u2208 LHP \u00d7 UHP, the integrand has no singularities in the domain\n{0 < Im(z1) < \u03b5} \u00d7 {\u2212\u03b5 < Im(z2) < 0}\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /qjm am /article/76/2/211/7199917 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nFig. 3 Domain {0 < Im(z1) < \u03b5}\u00d7 {0 < Im(z2) < \u03b5}, and branch sets z1 \u2261 \u00b1k1, z1 \u2261 \u00b1k2, z2 \u2261 \u00b1k2, z2 \u2261 \u00b1k2, as well as polar singularities z1 \u2261 \u03b1 1, z2 \u2261 \u03b1 2 and z2 \u2261 \u2192 \u221a k22 \u2212 (\u03b1 1)2 of the integrand in (3.7).\nas can be seen from the properties of \u2192 \u221a\nz (cf. Lemma 3.3 and Fig. 3). Due to the asymptotic behaviour of ++, the boundary terms \u2018at infinity\u2019 vanish, and therefore an application of Stokes\u2019 theorem proves the lemma. The corresponding \u2018contour deformation\u2019 is illustrated in Fig. 3.\nHenceforth, until specified otherwise, J denotes the function given by (3.8).\nLemma 3.6. J is analytic in H\u2212 \u00d7 UHP. Proof. For any z \u2208 R2, we know that the expression\nK(z1, z2) ++(z1, z2) (z2 \u2212 \u03b12)(z1 \u2212 \u03b11)\nis analytic in H\u2212 \u00d7 UHP as a function of \u03b1 since \u03b11 and \u03b12 are never real (by definition of UHP and H\u2212, cf. sections 2.2.1 and 3.3), hence the polar factors pose no problem. Let us now investigate\n1\nK\u25e6\u2212(\u03b11, z2) =\n\u2192 \u221a\nk21 \u2212 \u03b121 \u2212 z2 \u2192 \u221a\nk22 \u2212 \u03b121 \u2212 z2 .\nFor \u03b11 \u2208 H\u2212 we know (by Lemma 3.3) that \u2192 \u221a\nk22 \u2212 \u03b121 /\u2208 R. Hence, 1/K\u25e6\u2212(\u03b11, z2) is analytic in H\u2212 \u00d7 R. Let now \u2282 H\u2212 be any triangle. Then, using Fubini\u2019s theorem (which is possible due to the asymptotic behaviour (2.17)\u2013(2.19)) we find\u222b\n\u2202 J(w1, \u03b12)dw1 = \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e \u222b \u2202 K(z1, z2) ++(z1, z2) K\u25e6\u2212(w1, z2)(z2 \u2212 \u03b12)(z1 \u2212 w1)dw1dz1dz2. (3.9)\nBut since the integrand is holomorphic we know, by Cauchy\u2019s theorem ((32) Theorem 4.2.31), that\u222b \u2202 K(z1, z2) ++(z1, z2) K\u25e6\u2212(w1, z2)(z2 \u2212 \u03b12)(z1 \u2212 w1)dw1 = 0 (3.10)\nand therefore, by Morera\u2019s theorem ((32) Theorem 4.2.22), we find that J is holomorphic in the first coordinate. Similarly, we find that J is holomorphic in the second coordinate (for \u03b12 \u2208 UHP) and thus, by Hartogs\u2019 theorem ((23) Chapter 1, Section 2), we have proved analyticity in H\u2212 \u00d7 UHP.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /qjm am /article/76/2/211/7199917 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nWe now want to investigate the behaviour of J on the boundary of H\u2212 \u00d7 UHP. As in Lemma 3.5, it can be shown that\nJ(\u03b1) = \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e \u222b \u221e+ib0 \u2212\u221e+ib0 K(z1, z2) ++(z1, z2) K\u25e6\u2212(\u03b11, z2)(z2 \u2212 \u03b12)(z1 \u2212 \u03b11)dz1dz2 (3.11)\nand that for sufficiently small b0 \u2208 (0, \u03b5), for all z \u2208 (\u2212\u221e + ib0,\u221e + ib0) \u00d7 R the integrand (K(z1, z2) ++(z1, z2))/(K\u25e6\u2212(\u03b11, z2)(z2 \u2212 \u03b12)(z1 \u2212 \u03b11))\nis analytic, as a function of \u03b1, in a sufficiently small neighbourhood of any fixed (\u03b1 1, \u03b1 2) \u2208 R\u00d7UHP. Just as in the proof of Lemma 3.6, this yields:\nLemma 3.7. J can be analytically continued onto R \u00d7 UHP. Similarly (again, see (21) for the technical details involved):\nLemma 3.8. J can be analytically continued onto the other boundary components H\u2212 \u00d7 R, (P \\ {\u2212k1,\u2212k2}) \u00d7 UHP, and J is continuous on P \u00d7 R.\nLet us discuss the remaining terms involved in (3.5) and recall that a1,2 are given by (2.6). By definition of H\u2212, we find that the external terms 1/K\u25e6+ and 1/K\u25e6\u2212(\u03b11, a2) are analytic in H\u2212 \u00d7 UHP. P++ however, has a simple pole at a1 and is therefore only analytic in H\u2212 \\ {a1} \u00d7 UHP. Analyticity of these terms on the boundary elements R \u00d7 UHP, H\u2212 \\ {a1} \u00d7 R, P \\ {\u2212k1,\u2212k2} \u00d7 UHP, (P \\ {\u2212k1,\u2212k2} \u00d7 R) \\ {(\u03b11,\u2212 \u2192 \u221a k22 \u2212 \u03b121)| \u03b11 \u2208 P2} follows by definition of these sets and the properties of \u2192 \u221a z. Observe that we have to exclude {(\u03b11,\u2212 \u2192 \u221a\nk22 \u2212 \u03b121)| \u03b11 \u2208 P2} from P \\ {\u2212k1,\u2212k2} \u00d7R since it is a polar singularity of the external factor 1/K\u25e6+. This is different from the quarter-plane problem. To summarise:\nCorollary 3.9. The 1/4-based spectral function ++ satisfying the penetrable wedge functional problem 2.4 can be analytically continued onto H\u2212 \\ {a1} \u00d7 UHP. It can moreover be analytically continued onto the boundary elements R \u00d7 UHP, H\u2212 \\ {a1} \u00d7 R, P \\ {\u2212k1,\u2212k2} \u00d7 UHP, and continuously continued onto (P \u00d7 R) \\ {(\u03b11,\u2212 \u2192 \u221a k22 \u2212 \u03b121)| \u03b11 \u2208 P2}.\nRepeating the above procedure but using (3.6) instead (again, see (21) for the technical details involved), we obtain:\nCorollary 3.10. ++ can be analytically continued onto UHP \u00d7 H\u2212 \\ {a2} and onto the boundary elements UHP \u00d7R, R\u00d7 H\u2212 \\ {a2}, UHP \u00d7 P \\ {\u2212k1,\u2212k2}, and continuously continued onto (R\u00d7 P) \\ {(\u2212 \u2192 \u221a k22 \u2212 \u03b122, \u03b12)| \u03b12 \u2208 P2}.\nTherefore:\nTheorem 3.11. ++ can be analytically continued onto( UHP \u00d7 C \\ (h\u22121 \u222a h\u22122 \u222a {a2})) \u222a (C \\ (h\u22121 \u222a h\u22122 \u222a {a1}) \u00d7 UHP) ,\nas shown in Fig. 4, and ++ is analytic on this domain\u2019s boundary except on the distinct boundary (P \u00d7 R) \u222a (R \u00d7 P) on which ++ is continuous everywhere except on the curves given by {(\u03b11,\u2212 \u2192 \u221a k22 \u2212 \u03b121)|\u03b11 \u2208 P2} and {(\u2212 \u2192 \u221a k22 \u2212 \u03b122, \u03b12)|\u03b12 \u2208 P2} which yield polar singularities.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /qjm am /article/76/2/211/7199917 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nFig. 4 Domain of analyticity of ++, polar singularities \u03b12 \u2261 a2, \u03b11 \u2261 a1, branch sets \u03b12 \u2261 \u2212k1,2, \u03b11 \u2261 \u2212k1,2, and respective branch \u2018lines\u2019 h\u22121 and h\u22122 .\nNaturally, we ask whether a formula can be found for ++ in the \u2018missing\u2019 parts of Fig. 4 that is, whether we can find a formula for ++ in LHP \u00d7 LHP.

Again, we first focus on\nJ(\u03b1) = \u222b\u222b\nR2 K(z1, z2) ++(z1, z2) K\u25e6\u2212(\u03b11, z2)(z2 \u2212 \u03b12)(z1 \u2212 \u03b11)dz1dz2.\nChange the z1 contour from R to R \u2212 ib0, which will not hit any singularities of the integrand and therefore\nJ(\u03b1) = \u222b R \u222b R\u2212ib0 K(z1, z2) ++(z1, z2) K\u25e6\u2212(\u03b11, z2)(z2 \u2212 \u03b12)(z1 \u2212 \u03b11)dz1dz2. (3.13)\nNow, change the z2 contour from R to P. This will only hit the singularity of the integrand at z2 = a2 and therefore, this picks up a residue of the integrand at z2 = a2 (relative to clockwise orientation). Indeed, K ++ has no other singularities on (R\u2212 ib0) \u00d7 H\u2212 and no singularities on (R\u2212 ib0) \u00d7 P, as can be seen from formula (3.6). Therefore, we obtain\nJ(\u03b1) = \u222b\nP \u222b R\u2212ib0 K(z1, z2) ++(z1, z2) K\u25e6\u2212(\u03b11, z2)(z2 \u2212 \u03b12)(z1 \u2212 \u03b11)dz1dz2\n\u2212 2\u03c0 i \u222b R\u2212ib0 Res z2=a2 ( K(z1, z2) ++(z1, z2) K\u25e6\u2212(\u03b11, z2)(z2 \u2212 \u03b12)(z1 \u2212 \u03b11) ) dz1.

Use the resulting formula for J in (3.5) to obtain (3.12).\nSimilarly, changing the roles of (3.5) and (3.6) in the previous proof, we find:\nLemma 3.13. Let \u03b5 > b0 > 0.

We are now ready to prove this section\u2019s main result.\nTheorem 3.14. The function = K ++ can be analytically continued onto ( H\u2212(\u03b5) \\ {a1} ) \u00d7( H\u2212(\u03b5) \\ {a2} ) , for a1,2 given by (2.6) and \u03b5 as in (2.16), and is continuous on P\u00d7P. The residues of near the polar singularities \u03b11 \u2261 a1 and \u03b12 \u2261 a2 are given by\nRes \u03b11=a1 = \u2212 K\u25e6\u2212(a1, \u03b12) K\u25e6\u2212(a1, a2)(\u03b12 \u2212 a2) , (3.16)\nRes \u03b12=a2 = \u2212 K\u2212\u25e6(\u03b11, a2) K\u2212\u25e6(a1, a2)(\u03b11 \u2212 a1) . (3.17)\nProof. Due to (3.12) we can, for \u03b1 \u2208 (H\u2212(\u2212b0) \\ {a1}) \u00d7 S , write\n=K\u25e6\u2212 4\u03c02 \u222b P \u222b R\u2212ib0 K(z1, z2) ++(z1, z2) K\u25e6\u2212(\u03b11, z2)(z2 \u2212 \u03b12)(z1 \u2212 \u03b11)dz1dz2\n\u2212 K\u25e6\u2212K\u2212\u25e6(\u03b11, a2) K\u25e6\u2212(\u03b11, a2)K\u2212\u25e6(a1, a2)(\u03b11 \u2212 a1)(\u03b12 \u2212 a2) . (3.18)\nAs before, using Hartogs\u2019 and Morera\u2019s theorems we find that is analytic in (H\u2212(\u2212b0) \\ {a1}) \u00d7 (H\u2212(\u03b5) \\ {a2}). Similarly, using (3.15), we find analyticity of in (H\u2212(\u03b5) \\ {a1}) \u00d7 (H\u2212(\u2212b0) \\ {a2}). As ++ and K are analytic in S \u00d7 S so is , and therefore we find analyticity of in( H\u2212(\u03b5) \\ {a1}\n) \u00d7 (H\u2212(\u03b5) \\ {a2}). It remains to discuss continuity of on P \u00d7 P. Due to the properties of \u2192 \u221a z, continuity on this set is clear for all terms in (3.18) except for the integral expression\nJ(\u03b1) = \u222b\nP \u222b R\u2212ib0 K(z1, z2) ++(z1, z2) K\u25e6\u2212(\u03b11, z2)(z2 \u2212 \u03b12)(z1 \u2212 \u03b11)dz1dz2,\nwhere the polar factor (z2 \u2212 \u03b12) is problematic. But for \u03b12 close to P, we can change the contour from P to P\u2032 which encloses \u03b12 and h\u22121 \u222a h\u22122 , see Fig. 5. This picks up a residue of the integrand at z2 = \u03b12 which is given by\nK(z1, \u03b12) ++(z1, \u03b12) K\u25e6\u2212(\u03b11, \u03b12)(z1 \u2212 \u03b11) .\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /qjm am /article/76/2/211/7199917 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nFig. 5 Visualisation of the change of contour performed in Theorem 3.14\u2019s proof. For better visualisation, we only show the change locally about h\u22121 . After the residue is \u2018picked up\u2019 in Step 2, we can safely let \u03b12 \u2192 \u03b1 2 \u2208 h\u22121 in Step 3 since the singularities of the integrand now lie completely on the contour P\u2032 and the additional residue term poses no problems\nFig. 6 Domain of analyticity of = K ++ and 3/4, polar singularities \u03b11 \u2261 a1, \u03b12 \u2261 a2, branch sets \u03b11 \u2261 \u2212k1,2, \u03b12 \u2261 \u2212k1,2, and respective branch \u2018lines\u2019 h\u22121 and h\u22122 .\nThis residue has the required continuity as can be seen from (3.6), so we can safely let \u03b12 \u2192 \u03b1 2 for any \u03b1 2 \u2208 h\u22121 \u222a h\u22122 , which gives the sought continuation. The residue of at the pole \u03b11 = a1 can be computed explicitly from (3.18) since only the external additive term is singular at \u03b11 = a1. Similarly, the residue of at \u03b12 = a2 is computed.\nThe domain of analyticity of is shown in Fig. 6 below. Recall that, by the Wiener\u2013Hopf equation (2.14), we have 3/4 = \u2212K ++ \u2212 P++ = \u2212 \u2212 P++ so the analyticity properties of hold for 3/4 as well.

(3.20)\nThis set, that is the intersection of singularities of ++ and 3/4 with R2, is henceforth referred to as the \u2018real trace\u2019 of the singularities. By (22), knowledge of the real trace of the singularities is crucial to compute far-field asymptotics of \u03c6sc and \u03c8 . According to our previous analysis, assuming that our formulae hold in the limit Im(k1) \u2192 0 and Im(k2) \u2192 0, we find\nRe(\u03b11) \u2261 a1, Re(\u03b12) \u2261 a2; polar sets, (3.21) Re(\u03b11) \u2261 \u2212k1, Re(\u03b11) \u2261 \u2212k2, Re(\u03b12) \u2261 \u2212k1, Re(\u03b12) \u2261 \u2212k2; branch sets. (3.22)\nHowever, note that as Im(k2) \u2192 0 we also expect parts of the (complexified) circle defined by \u03b121 + \u03b122 = k22 to become singular points of ++: From the analytical continuation procedure, we know that such singularities can only \u2018come from\u2019 H\u2212 \\ {a1} \u00d7 H\u2212 \\ {a2}. However, we know how, exactly, ++ can be represented in H\u2212 \\ {a1} \u00d7 H\u2212 \\ {a2}, namely by (3.12). Therefore, to unveil ++\u2019s singularities in H\u2212 \\ {a1} \u00d7 H\u2212 \\ {a2}, we just need to analyse the external term in (3.12), since the integral term is by construction analytic in H\u2212 \u00d7 H\u2212. Now, in H\u2212 \\ {a1} \u00d7 H\u2212 \\ {a2}, the external factor is only singular for\nK\u25e6+ = \u2192 \u221a\nk22 \u2212 \u03b121 + \u03b12 \u2192 \u221a\nk21 \u2212 \u03b121 + \u03b12 = 0 (3.23)\nthat is whenever\n\u2192 \u221a\nk22 \u2212 \u03b121 = \u2212\u03b12, (3.24)\nsince by definition of H\u2212 \\ {aj}, j = 1, 2, the singularity sets given in (3.21) and (3.22) do not belong to H\u2212 \\ {aj}, j = 1, 2. As the branch of the square root is chosen such that \u2192 \u221a k22 = k2, we find that if Re(\u03b11) = 0, we must have Re(\u03b12) = \u2212k2, giving the first real singular point of (3.24). Now, by continuity, we find that Re(\u03b12) \u2264 0 for all Re(\u03b12) satisfying (3.24). However, Re(\u03b11) can take all values between \u2212k2 and k2.\nSimilarly, from (3.15), we find that ++ is singular in H\u2212 \\ {a1} \u00d7 H\u2212 \\ {a2} when\nK+\u25e6 = \u2192 \u221a\nk22 \u2212 \u03b122 + \u03b11 \u2192 \u221a\nk21 \u2212 \u03b122 + \u03b11 = 0 (3.25)\nthat is whenever\n\u2192 \u221a\nk22 \u2212 \u03b122 = \u2212\u03b11. (3.26)\nThen, just as before we find that (3.26) is satisfied for all Re(\u03b12) \u2208 [\u2212k2, k2] and Re(\u03b11) \u2264 0.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /qjm am /article/76/2/211/7199917 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nFig. 7 Real trace of the singularities of ++ and 3/4.

Let us now consider the case \u03d10 \u2208 (\u03c0/2, \u03c0 ). Due to symmetry, the case \u03d10 \u2208 (3\u03c0/2, 2\u03c0 ) can be dealt with similarly. We now treat \u03d10 as a parameter within the formulae for analytic continuation (3.5), (3.6), (3.12) and (3.15) of ++. This yields formulae for ++ when \u03d10 \u2208 (\u03c0/2, \u03c0 ). We then obtain new singularities within these formulae for analytic continuation. Namely, the external additive term in (3.5) becomes singular at {\u03b11 \u2261 \u2212 \u2192 \u221a k22 \u2212 a22}. This procedure therefore yields a new singularity of ++ and 3/4 within LHP \u00d7C. The real traces of the spectral functions\u2019 singularities in this case are shown in Fig. 8. Note that we may not allow \u03d10 \u2208 (0, \u03c0/2). This is because such change of incident angle changes the incident wave\u2019s wavenumber from k1 to k2, and therefore such change cannot be assumed to be continuous.\nRemark 3.15 (Failure of limiting absorption principle) In the case of \u03d10 \u2208 (\u03c0/2, \u03c0 ), we cannot directly impose the radiation condition on the scattered and transmitted fields via the limiting absorption principle, although, of course, a radiation condition still needs to be imposed. The failure of defining the radiation condition via the absorption principle is due to the fact that for positive\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /qjm am /article/76/2/211/7199917 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nFig. 8 Real traces of ++ and 3/4\u2019s singularities in the case \u03d10 \u2208 (\u03c0/2, \u03c0 ).

The main difference with Fig. 7 is the appearance of a new singularity at \u03b11 \u2261 \u2212 \u2192 \u221a k22 \u2212 a22 and the fact that the singularity at \u03b12 \u2261 a2 has changed half-plane\nimaginary part \u03ba > 0 of k1 and k2, such incident angle changes the sign of a2: Whereas for \u03d10 \u2208 (\u03c0, 3\u03c0/2) we are guaranteed Im(a1), Im(a2) < 0 whenever\u03ba > 0 we now have Im(a1) < 0, and Im(a2) > 0 whenever\u03ba > 0. Thus, when \u03d10 \u2208 (\u03c0/2, \u03c0 ), one has to carefully choose the \u2018indentation\u2019 of R2 around the real traces of the singularities such that the radiation condition remains valid.

Let \u03b1l,r1,2\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /qjm am /article/76/2/211/7199917 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\ndenote the values on the left (resp. right) side of h\u22121 and h \u2212 2 , respectively, and define\nAC(\u03b1) = { 3/4(\u03b1r1, \u03b1 r 2) + 3/4(\u03b1l1, \u03b1l2) \u2212 3/4(\u03b1l1, \u03b1r2) \u2212 3/4(\u03b1r1, \u03b1l2), if \u03b1 \u2208 (h\u22121 \u00d7 h\u22121 ) \u222a (h\u22122 \u00d7 h\u22122 ),\n3/4(\u03b1l1, \u03b1 r 2) + 3/4(\u03b1r1, \u03b1l2) \u2212 3/4(\u03b1r1, \u03b1r2) \u2212 3/4(\u03b1l1, \u03b1l2), if \u03b1 \u2208 (h\u22122 \u00d7 h\u22121 ) \u222a (h\u22121 \u00d7 h\u22122 ).\nUsing the analyticity properties as well as the asymptotic behaviour (2.17)\u2013(2.19) of 3/4, it can be shown that AC is Lipschitz continuous on h\n\u2212 1 \u222a h\u22122 . We now rewrite (4.4) as\u222b\nP \u222b P 3/4(\u03b1)e \u2212i\u03b1\u00b7xd\u03b1 = \u222b h\u22121 \u222ah\u22122 \u222b h\u22121 \u222ah\u22122 AC(\u03b1)e \u2212i\u03b1\u00b7xd\u03b1 = 0, \u2200x \u2208 Q1. (4.5)\nThe equality (4.5) is always satisfied if AC = 0 on (h\u22121 \u222a h\u22122 ) \u00d7 (h\u22121 \u222a h\u22122 ). But in fact, since AC is Lipschitz continuous, we can apply Corollary A.3 and we find that (4.5) is equivalent to\nAC(\u03b1) = 0, \u2200 \u03b1 \u2208 (h\u22121 \u222a h\u22122 ) \u00d7 (h\u22121 \u222a h\u22122 ), (4.6)\nthat is (4.5) is equivalent to the fact that 3/4 satisfies\n3/4(\u03b1 r 1, \u03b1 r 2) + 3/4(\u03b1l1, \u03b1l2) \u2212 3/4(\u03b1l1, \u03b1r2) \u2212 3/4(\u03b1r1, \u03b1l2) = 0 (4.7)\nfor all (\u03b11, \u03b12) \u2208 (h\u22121 \u222a h\u22122 ) \u00d7 (h\u22121 \u222a h\u22122 ). Note that the Corollary can be applied due to the minus in front of the exponential in (4.5), so in the setting of Corollary A.3 we choose the lines {x1 \u2264 0, x2 = 0} and {x1 = 0, x2 \u2264 0}. Although (4.6) and (4.7) depend on the choice of branch cuts h\u22121 and h\u22122 , it can be shown that if (4.7) holds for one choice of branch cuts, it holds for every choice. Therefore, it makes sense to say that the equality (4.7) holds with respect to the points (\u2212kj,\u2212kl), j, l = 1, 2 that iswith respect to the points of crossing of branch sets, as illustrated in Fig. 7. Moreover, since 3/4 is bounded near its branch sets, (4.7) is sufficient to prove that 3/4 satisfies the following additive crossing property: There exists some neighbourhood Uj,l \u2282 C2 of (kj, kl), j, l = 1, 2, such that\n3/4(\u03b1) = F1j(\u03b1) + F2l(\u03b1),\u2200\u03b1 \u2208 Uj,l, j, l = 1, 2, (4.8)\nwhere F1j(\u03b1) is regular at \u03b11 \u2261 \u2212kj, and F2l is regular at \u03b12 \u2261 \u2212kl. The proof is identical to the corresponding proof of the additive crossing property satisfied by the spectral function of the quarter-plane problem (see (21) Section 4), and hence omitted. As mentioned at the beginning of section 4, the additive crossing property is directly linked to the far-field behaviour of the scattered and transmitted fields.\n4.2 Reformulation of the functional problem\nFinally, we obtain the following reformulation of Theorem 2.5.\nTheorem 4.2. Let P++ and K be as in (2.13). Let ++ satisfy the following properties:\n1. ++ is analytic in( UHP \u00d7 C \\ (h\u22121 \u222a h\u22122 \u222a {a2})) \u222a (C \\ (h\u22121 \u222a h\u22122 \u222a {a1}) \u00d7 UHP) ,\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /qjm am /article/76/2/211/7199917 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\n2. There exists an \u03b5 > 0 such that the function 3/4 defined by 3/4 = \u2212K ++ \u2212 P++ is analytic in (\nH\u2212(\u03b5) \\ {a1} ) \u00d7 (H\u2212(\u03b5) \\ {a2})\nwith simple poles at \u03b11 = a1 and \u03b12 = a2, 3. The residues of \u2212 3/4 \u2212 P++ at the poles \u03b11 = a1 and \u03b12 = a2 are given by (3.16) and (3.17), 4. 3/4 is continuous on P \u00d7 P and satisfies the additive crossing property for each of the following points: (\u2212k1,\u2212k1), (\u2212k1,\u2212k2), (\u2212k2,\u2212k2) and (\u2212k2,\u2212k2), 5. The functions ++ and 3/4 have the asymptotic behaviour (2.17)\u2013(2.19).\nThen, the fields \u03c6sc and \u03c8 defined by\n\u03c6sc(x) = 1 4\u03c02 \u222b\u222b R2 3/4(\u03b1)e \u2212i\u03b1\u00b7xd\u03b1 and \u03c8(x) = 1 4\u03c02 \u222b\u222b R2 ++(\u03b1)e\u2212i\u03b1\u00b7xd\u03b1 (4.9)\nsatisfy the penetrable wedge problem defined by (2.1)\u2013(2.4) with respect to the incident wave \u03c6in(x) = exp(\u2212i(a1x1 + a2x2)). Moreover, they satisfy the Meixner conditions (2.8)\u2013(2.9) as well as the Sommerfeld radiation condition.\nThe theorem\u2019s proof is immediate since, according to sections 3\u20134, the conditions 1\u20135 of Theorem 4.2 imply that ++ and 3/4 satisfy the penetrable wedge functional problem and therefore Theorem 2.5 holds for \u03c6sc and \u03c8 ."

            "text": "We have shown that the novel additive crossing property, which was introduced in (21) in the context of diffraction by a quarter-plane, holds for the problem of diffraction by a penetrable wedge. Indeed, in similarity to the 1D Wiener\u2013Hopf technique, the spectral functions\u2019 singularities within C2 solely depend on the kernel K and the forcing P++, and therefore the techniques developed by Assier and Shanin in (21) could be adapted to the penetrable wedge diffraction problem, once equivalence of the penetrable wedge functional problem and the physical problem was shown in section 2.2.3. However, as in (21), we cannot apply Liouville\u2019s theorem since, according to Theorem 4.2, the domains of analyticity of the unknowns ++ and 3/4 span all of C2 minus some set of singularities.\nNonetheless, using the in section 3.6 established real traces of the spectral functions\u2019 singularities, we expect to be able to obtain far-field asymptotics of the physical fields using the framework developed in (22). In particular, as in (26), we expect the diffraction coefficient in R2 \\ PW (resp. PW) to be proportional to ++ (resp. ) evaluated at a given point. Moreover, we expect that a similar phenomenon holds for the lateral waves. That is, we expect that the results of the present article and (22) allow us to represent the lateral waves such that their decay and phase are explicitly known, whereas their coefficients are proportional to, say, ++, evaluated at a given point. Thus, we expect to be able to use the results of (20) to accurately approximate the far field in the spirit of (33). We moreover plan to test far-field accuracy of Radlow\u2019s erroneous ansatz (which was given in (12)).\nFinally, we note that Liouville\u2019s theorem is not only applicable to functions in C2 but also to functions defined on suitably \u2018nice\u2019 complex manifolds, see (34, 35). Therefore, gaining a better understanding of the complex manifold on which ++ and 3/4 are defined could be crucial to completing the 2D Wiener\u2013Hopf technique. Note that this final step is presumably easier for the\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /qjm am /article/76/2/211/7199917 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\npenetrable wedge than for the quarter-plane since in the latter, the real trace of the complexified circle is a branch set (see (21)) which could drastically change the topology of the sought complex manifold."
