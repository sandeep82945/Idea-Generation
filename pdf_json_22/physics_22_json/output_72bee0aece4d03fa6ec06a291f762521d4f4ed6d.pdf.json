    "abstractText": "In this paper, a three-party secure semiquantum summation protocol, which can calculate the modulo 2 addition of the private bits from one quantum participant and two classical participants, is constructed by only using single qubits as the initial quantum resource. This protocol needs none of quantum entanglement swapping, the unitary operation or a pre-shared private key. This protocol only requires the quantum participant to perform the \uf07b \uf07d 0 , 1 basis measurements, the \uf07b \uf07d , + \u2212 basis measurements and the Bell basis measurements. Compared with the existing only semiquantum summation protocol (Int J Theor Phys, 60 (2021) 3478), this protocol has better performance in quantum measurements for quantum participant; moreover, it may also have higher qubit efficiency.",

            "text": "Secure quantum summation, which is one of the basic problems of quantum secure\ncomputation, has been a hot topic of study in recent years. The goal of secure quantum summation is to output the correct summation result of the private inputs from different parties while keeping them secret. A lot good achievements on secure quantum summation [1-15] have been derived from different quantum technologies during the last two decades. Unfortunately, each of the quantum summation protocols in Refs.[3-15] requires all parties to be equipped with full quantum capabilities, which may be unpractical in some circumstances.\nRecently, the brand-new concept of semiquantum cryptography was proposed for the first time\nby Boyer et al. [16-17] in their semiquantum key distribution (SQKD) protocols, which permits the classical parties not to have full quantum capabilities. In the years of 2020 and 2022, Ye et al. [18- 19] employed single photons in both polarization and spatial-mode degrees of freedom to design two novel SQKD protocols. Referring to Refs.[16-17], the classical parties are always restricted to implement the four operations: \u2460sending the qubits without disturbance; \u2461measuring the qubits\nwith the  0 1\uff0c basis; \u2462generating the qubits in the  0 1\uff0c basis; \u2463scrambling the qubits.\nCompared with the conventional quantum cryptography, semiquantum cryptography releases a part of parties from the preparation and measurement of quantum superposition states and quantum entangled states. The counterpart of quantum summation in the realm of semiquantum cryptography is semiquantum summation. In the year of 2021, Zhang et al. [20] constructed the first semiquantum summation protocol by using single qubits, which can compute the modulo 2 addition of the private inputs from three classical parties under the help of a quantum semi-honest third party (TP).\nBased on the above analysis, in this paper, different from the only existing semiquantum\nsummation protocol of Ref.[20], in order to accomplish the goal of calculating the modulo 2 addition\nof the private bits from one quantum participant and two classical participants, a three-party secure\nsemiquantum summation protocol is put forward by only using single qubits as the initial quantum\nresource. Compared with the protocol of Ref.[20], the proposed protocol has better performance in\nquantum measurements for quantum participant; moreover, it may also have higher qubit efficiency."

Suppose that\nAlice is equipped with full quantum capabilities, but both Bob and Charlie only possess limited quantum capabilities. They aim to obtain the modulo 2 addition of their private bit strings. Based on the semiquantum private comparison (SQPC) protocol of Ref.[21], the following protocol is proposed to achieve this goal, where the quantum channels are supposed to be ideal.\nStep 1: Alice produces a particle sequence of length ( )2 8n   + + + whose particles are all in\nthe state of + . Afterward, she makes these particles form two subsequences of the same length,\n( ) 81 2, , , nb b b bP p p p   + + += and ( ) 81 2, , , nc c c cP p p p   + + += , and then transmits the particles of bP to\nBob and the particles of cP to Charlie both in the way of one by one. Note that except the first particle, the next one is sent out by Alice only after she receives the previous one. Here, ,  are positive integers;  is some parameter bigger than 0; tjp is the t th particle of jP , where ,j b c= and\n( )1,2, , 8t n   = + + + .\nStep 2: Bob imposes randomly one of the following two actions on each coming particle in bP : returning it to Alice directly (called as the CTRL action) or transmitting the same state as found to Alice after measuring it in the 0 1\uff0c basis (called as the SIFT action). After Bob\u2019s actions, bP is changed into ' bP .\nCharlie also imposes randomly the CTRL action or the SIFT action on each coming particle in\ncP . After Charlie\u2019s actions, cP is changed into ' cP .\nStep 3: Alice and Bob cooperate together to check whether there is an Eve attacking the particles transmitted between them. Alice randomly selects n particles from ' bP and publishes Bob the positions of these chosen ones. As for these chosen particles, Bob tells Alice his actions on them and his measurement results on the SIFT particles; then, Alice uses the + \u2212\uff0c basis to measure\nthe CTRL particles and the 0 1\uff0c basis to measure the SIFT particles; afterward, Alice calculates\nthe error rate of the CTRL particles and the error rate of the SIFT particles. Obviously, when there is no Eve, as for the CTRL particles, Alice\u2019s measurement results on them should be same as their prepared states; as for the SIFT particles, Alice\u2019s measurement results on them should be identical to Bob\u2019s measurement results on them. If either of these two kinds of error rates is abnormally high, the protocol will be stopped immediately.\nIn the meanwhile, Alice randomly selects n particles from ' cP , publishes Charlie the positions of these chosen ones and works together with Charlie to check whether there is an Eve attacking the particles transmitted between them in the way same as above.\nStep 4: Alice picks out the l th particle of the remaining ( )8n  + + particles in 'bP and the l th particle of the remaining ( )8n  + + particles in 'cP to form the l th particle group, where ( )1,2, , 8l n  = + + . Then, Alice measures these ( )8n  + + particle groups with the Bell basis. When Alice\u2019s measurement result is  + or  + , she announces it to Bob and Charlie directly; and\nwhen her measurement result is  \u2212 or  \u2212 , she announces \u2018summation\u2019 to Bob and Charlie. If the\ntimes that Alice announces \u2018summation\u2019 is abnormally low, the protocol will be terminated immediately by Bob and Charlie; otherwise, it will be carried on.\nIn order to check whether Alice is honest or not, Bob and Charlie randomly pick out n groups from these ( )8n  + + particle groups. For the particle group where both Bob and Charlie took the CTRL actions, according to Eq.(9), no error is detected when Alice\u2019s measurement result is  + or\n + ; and an error is detected when Alice announces \u2018summation\u2019. For the particle group where\nboth Bob and Charlie took the SIFT actions, when Alice\u2019s measurement result is  + or  + , they\ncheck whether Alice\u2019s measurement result complies with Eqs.(5-8) or not. If Alice is found to be dishonest, the protocol will be halted immediately; otherwise, it will be carried on.\nStep 5: Among the remaining ( )8n + particle groups, the number of particle groups where\nboth Bob and Charlie took the SIFT actions and Alice announced \u2018summation\u2019 is 8\nn n  + . Bob and\nCharlie select the first n particle groups from these 8\nn n  + ones to compute the summation and\nannounce the positions of these n chosen particle groups to Alice. Then, Alice, Bob and Charlie\nproduce the corresponding one-time pad key bits from their respective measurement results for these n particle groups.

Apparently, the transmission mode of the particles in bP is essentially similar to that of the particles in cP .

After Bob finishes his action, Eve imposes\nthe CNOT operation again on the particle in ' bP from Bob and her ancillary particle, where the former\nand the latter are also the control qubit and the target qubit, respectively. Ref.[21] has proven in\ndetail that by launching this kind of attack, Eve can only achieve the goal of not being discovered,\nbut she cannot discriminate Bob\u2019s action on this particle through her ancillary particle. In other words, she obtains nothing useful about BK while not being discovered.\n(3) Measure-resend attack\nEve intercepts the particles in bP from Alice to Bob, uses the 0 1\uff0c basis to measure them and\ntransmits the fresh ones as found to Bob.

            "text": "We further consider the participant attack, which was firstly put forward by Gao et al. [24] in\nthe year of 2007. Apparently, in the proposed protocol, when any two dishonest users collude\ntogether, they can deduce out the left one\u2019s private bit string from the summation result without any\neffort. As a result, the proposed protocol cannot resist the collusion attack from any two dishonest\nusers. Consequently, we only need to consider the participant attack from one dishonest user.\n(1) Participant attack from Alice\nAlice may try her best to extractY from BR and Z from CR . In order to achieve these goals, Alice\nfirst needs to know BK and CK , respectively.\nAttack I: In order to directly get BK and CK , Alice produces all particles in the 0 1\uff0c basis in\nStep 1 and then sends them to Bob and Charlie, respectively; moreover, Alice always plays no tricks on her announcements to Bob and Charlie in Step 4 with regard to her Bell basis measurement\nresults on the remaining ( )8n  + + particle groups. Fortunately, Alice\u2019s attack can be detected by\nthe security check from Bob and Charlie in Step 4. For one chosen particle group for checking Alice\u2019s honesty, by virtue of Eqs.(5-9), when both Bob and Charlie take the CTRL actions on the\ncorresponding particles, the probability that Alice\u2019s attack can be detected is 2\n1 ; when both Bob and\nCharlie take the SIFT actions on the corresponding particles, the probability that Alice\u2019s attack can be detected is 0; when Bob and Charlie take different actions on the corresponding particles, the probability that Alice\u2019s attack can be detected is 0, as Bob and Charlie do not check this situation. As a result, for one chosen particle group for checking Alice\u2019s honesty, the probability that Alice\u2019s\nattack can be detected is 8\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1 = . For n chosen particle groups for checking Alice\u2019s honesty,\nAlice\u2019s attack can be detected with the probability of 7\n1 8\nn  \n\u2212     . When n is large enough, this\nprobability is close to 1.\nAttack II: Alice uses the Z basis rather than the Bell basis to measure all particles in the\nremaining ( )8n  + + particle groups, and tries to pass the honesty check toward her by announcing\nthe fake Bell basis measurement results to Bob and Charlie in Step 4. For one chosen particle group\nfor checking Alice\u2019s honesty, according to Eqs.(5-8), when Alice\u2019s measurement result is 0 0 or\n1 1 , she always announces the fake measurement result  + ; and when Alice\u2019s measurement\nresult is 0 1 or 1 0 , she always announces the fake measurement result  + ; as a result, no\nmatter what actions Bob and Charlie take on the corresponding particles, the probability that Alice\u2019s attack can be detected is always 0. Although Alice can pass the honesty check toward her, her attack makes the protocol automatically terminated by Bob and Charlie, as the times that she announces \u2018summation\u2019 is 0. In order to let the protocol continued, for one chosen particle group for checking\nAlice\u2019s honesty, Alice randomly announces the fake measurement result  + or \u2018summation\u2019, when\nher measurement result is 0 0 or 1 1 ; and she randomly announces the fake measurement result\n + or \u2018summation\u2019, when her measurement result is 0 1 or 1 0 ; as a result, when both Bob and\nCharlie take the SIFT actions on the corresponding particles, the probability that Alice\u2019s attack can be detected is 0; and when both Bob and Charlie take the CTRL actions on the corresponding\nparticles, the probability that Alice\u2019s attack can be detected is 2\n1 . Hence, for one chosen particle\ngroup for checking Alice\u2019s honesty, Alice\u2019s attack can be detected with the probability of\n8\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1 = . For n chosen particle groups for checking Alice\u2019s honesty, Alice\u2019s attack can be\ndetected with the probability of 7\n1 8\nn  \n\u2212     .\n(2) Participant attack from Bob or Charlie In the proposed protocol, Bob plays the same role as Charlie. Without loss of generality, here\nassume that Bob is dishonest. Bob may try his best to extract X from AR and Z from CR . In order to achieve these goals, Bob first needs to know AK and CK , respectively. AK and CK are derived from the particle groups where both Bob and Charlie took the SIFT actions and Alice announced \u2018summation\u2019. Bob may try to implement the following attack to get CK : he intercepts and uses the\n 0 1\uff0c basis to measure the corresponding particles in cP sent out from Alice whose counterparts\nin bP were performed with the SIFT operations by him, and transmits the resulted particles to Charlie. However, Bob has no access to Charlie\u2019s actions on them, which results in his cheating behavior being discovered. With respect to one chosen position for detection in Step 3, the probability that\nBob took the SIFT action on the corresponding particle in bP is 2\n1 ; the probability that Charlie took\nthe CTRL action on the corresponding particle in cP is also 2\n1 ; as a result, Alice obtains the wrong\nmeasurement result \u2212 with the probability of 2\n1 ; hence, the probability that Bob\u2019s cheating\nbehavior can be discovered in Step 3 is 8\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1\n2\n1 = . For n chosen positions for detection in Step\n3, the probability that Bob\u2019s cheating behavior can be detected is nr\n      \u2212 8 7 1 . In addition, because Bob\ncannot obtain CK without being discovered, he has no chance to get AK via BK and CK . Moreover, Bob cannot obtain AK through Alice\u2019s announcement of \u2018summation\u2019 either.\nIt can be concluded that Bob has no chance to get X and Z without being discovered."
