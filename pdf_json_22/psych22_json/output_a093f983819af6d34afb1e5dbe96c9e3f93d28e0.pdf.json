Prof. Hern\u00e2ni Monteiro, Porto, Portugal, Tel +35 1 22 0426994, Email lribeiro@med.up.pt; lauratribeiro@gmail.com\nPurpose: Maladaptive personality traits and some psychological functioning indicators have been linked to academic misbehaviour; yet their role is still poorly explored in medical students. This study aims to assess associations of academic misconduct with dark personality traits and psychological well-being. Methods: Five hundred and ninety-one medical students attending the first, third and fifth-year at one Portuguese medical school replied to the Dark Triad Dirty Dozen, Ryff\u2019s Psychological Well-Being Scales and an original Academic Misconduct Questionnaire, using a cross-sectional design. Multiple linear regression was performed to assess associations. Results: Fifth-year medical students who scored higher in Machiavellianism and psychological well-being and perceived greater peer fraud and lower penalty for cheating reported more academic misconduct. The explanatory power of the model was 16.6%. Machiavellianism showed the strongest associations with cheating, while sex and age were not significant predictors. Conclusion: This study offers relevant insights into how maladaptive personalities influence academic misconduct in medical students, and how this relationship is moulded by psychological and contextual factors. These findings can help guide institutional actions to foster academic integrity in future physicians. Keywords: academic integrity, dark personality traits, psychological well-being, medical education"

At this level, the relationship of dark personality traits and psychological well-being with academic misbehaviour remains poorly understood. Therefore, this study aims to assess their role in explaining academic misconduct in medical students, while also evaluating the impact of sociodemographic characteristics and cheating-related perceptions."

The Portuguese version54 of the Dark Triad Dirty Dozen (DTDD)41 was used to measure three maladaptive personality traits, namely Machiavellianism (DTDD-M) as manipulative and cynical individuals with ambition for power and success; psychopathy (DTDD-P) linked to impulsivity, daring behaviour and lack of empathy; and narcissism (DTDD-N) which translates into arrogance, self-centredness, vanity and feelings of superiority.40,41 The DTDD comprehends a total of 12 items (4 items per subscale) on which participants indicate agreement on a five-point Likert scale (1 \u2013 \u201cstrongly disagree\u201d to 5 \u2013 \u201cstrongly agree\u201d). For each subscale, higher values correspond to greater levels of each dark trait. Principal components analysis (PCA) revealed the three-factor solution originally validated (items had factor loadings >|0.50|). The scale revealed adequate reliability (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = 0.50\u20130.79).55\nThe Portuguese version56 of Ryff\u2019s Psychological Well-Being Scales (PWBS)57 was applied as an overall measure of psychological well-being assessed using the sum score of student answers to the six dimensions that define the construct: autonomy (AU) as independence and living according to internal convictions; environmental mastery (EM) as the ability to manage life situations; personal growth (PG) linked to curiosity, openness to experience and self-actualization; positive relations with others (PR) as the ability to establish meaningful and trust-based relationships; purpose in life (PL) as a sense of meaning and direction in life; and self-acceptance (SA) which involves knowing and accepting oneself.45 The PWBS has a total of 18 items, each presented as a descriptive statement, with a mix of positively and negatively orientated items, assessed using a six-point Likert scale (1 \u2013 \u201ccompletely disagree\u201d to 6 \u2013 \u201ccompletely agree\u201d). Negative items were inverted prior to statistical analysis. Higher values correspond to higher levels of PWB. PCA identified one-factor solution, and two items (3 and 13) were removed due to very low factor loadings (<|0.20|). The final scale consisting of 16 items had good reliability (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = 0.86). Item statistics for the DTDD and PWBS can be found in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2, respectively.\nCheating-related behaviours and perceptions were assessed using an original Academic Misconduct Questionnaire (AMQ). Thirty-one items describe various types of academic misbehaviours, such as using hidden notes during exams, copying/allowing a colleague to copy an academic work, signing/asking others to sign attendance sheets when missing a class, copying ideas without referencing the source and obtaining/providing information about exams in advance. Students are requested to rate how frequently they have engaged in each behaviour during medical school using a five-point Likert scale (0 \u2013 \u201cnever\u201d to 4 \u2013 \u201cvery often\u201d). Higher scores indicate greater academic misconduct.58 PCA revealed a one-factor solution, and three items (6, 16 and 18) were removed due to very low factor loadings (<|0.20|). The final scale had good reliability (Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = 0.87). Additionally, the scale has one item that assesses how often students perceive their peers to engage in academic cheating (Peer Fraud) using the same Likert scale, and one item measures the perceived severity of the institutional penalty if caught cheating (Severity of Penalty) using a five-point Likert scale (0 \u2013 \u201cnone\u201d to 4 \u2013 \u201csevere\u201d). Higher scores indicate perceptions of greater cheating and penalty, respectively."

            "text": "Five hundred and ninety-one medical students participated in this study, most of them being females and were enrolled in three different academic years of the medical course. The sociodemographic information of the participants is summarized in Table 1.\nCorrelations between dark personality traits, psychological well-being and cheating-related behaviour (AMQ) and perceptions were initially analysed using Pearson correlations (see Supplementary Table S3). The three dark traits showed high and significant correlations with the DTDD (r > 0.670), as for inter-trait correlations, the highest was observed between Machiavellianism and psychopathy (r = 0.434) (p < 0.01). The DTDD (r = 0.238) and its dimensions were significantly and positively correlated with academic misconduct, with Machiavellianism showing the highest correlations (r = 0.295), followed by Narcissism (r = 0.113) (p < 0.01), and psychopathy (r = 0.093; p < 0.05). Psychological well-being was negatively correlated with the DTDD (r = \u22120.173), DTDD-M (r = \u22120.168) and DTDDP (r = \u22120.140) (p < 0.01), revealing no significant correlations with academic misconduct (r = 0.052; p = 0.233). Perceptions about peer fraud and severity of penalty for cheating were positively (r = 0.276) and negatively (r = \u22120.136) correlated with the AMQ (p < 0.01), respectively. There were no statistically significant correlations between cheatingrelated perceptions and personality and psychological dimensions.\nSocio-demographics, personality traits and cheating-related perceptions were entered step-by-step as independent variables in the regression model to determine which variables would contribute to explain a significant amount of variance in academic cheating. Due to intercorrelations between age and academic year, only the one that demonstrated the greatest significant contribution was kept in the equation model. The same was performed for the three dark personality traits, so only one (DTDD-M/P/N) was also kept in the model.\nThe regression model including academic year, Machiavellianism, PWB, Peer Fraud and Severity of Penalty explained 16.6% of total variance in the AMQ, with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.42. Durbin-Watson was 1.67,\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S370402 DovePress Psychology Research and Behavior Management 2022:15 2100\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nwith F (6, 532) = 18.59, p < 0.001. Fifth-year medical students who scored higher in Machiavellianism and psychological well-being and perceived greater peer fraud and lighter penalty for cheating reported higher engagement in academic misconduct. Machiavellianism was the strongest predictor of cheating. When adjusted for the remaining variables, psychological well-being proved to be a significant contributor to explain academic cheating, being positively associated with it. Academic year was a better predictor of cheating than age, which did not significantly contribute to the model, as well as sex. Results of the regression model are presented in Table 2."

            "text": "This study aimed to assess relationships between dark personality traits, psychological well-being and academic cheating in medical students, while also evaluating the impact of sociodemographic characteristics and cheating-related perceptions.\nFifth-year medical students who scored higher on Machiavellianism and psychological well-being and perceived greater peer fraud and lower severity of institutional penalty for cheating were more likely to report academic misconduct. Sex was not a significant predictor of cheating in this study, which is aligned with other available evidence.12,60 Personality and psychological wellness explained around half (8.8%) of the total variance (16.6%) in academic misconduct, with Machiavellianism offering the greatest contribution to the model.\nOf the three dark personality traits, Machiavellianism was the strongest and most significant predictor of academic cheating in this study. Machiavellianism was also the DTDD trait most strongly associated with research misconduct in PhD students and biomedical scientists38 and with academic cheating in undergraduate students.61 Machiavellianism was linked with academic cheating in higher education students in three other studies,34\u201336 although in all of them\nPsychology Research and Behavior Management 2022:15 https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S370402 DovePress 2101\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\npsychopathy displayed the strongest associations with cheating. In this study, psychopathy did not significantly contribute to the model, possibly due to some overlap between psychopathy and Machiavellianism, both sharing a malevolent component.62,63 Compared to lower scorers, students who rank higher on Machiavellianism tend to show less motivation for learning64 and may resort to a multitude of duplicitous tactics, including academic misconduct, to achieve their goals, disregarding morality and social norms.36,38,65\nAmong clinicians, high levels of Machiavellianism have been linked to counterproductive work behaviour,43,44 indifference and negative attitudes towards some groups of patients,33 ultimately undermining patient care. Therefore, implementing mechanisms to detect and support these students may be useful not only to tackle cheating but also to prevent subsequent professional misconduct.18,19,43,44\nA first analysis showed no correlation between psychological well-being and academic misconduct. Although, when adjusting for the remaining information a somehow surprising positive association with cheating was observed, contrasting with evidence that reports inverse correlations of cheating with other indicators of psychological wellness, such as spiritual well-being66 and satisfaction with life.51,66 Students with higher scores on PWB have a more positive self-perception, seeing themselves as more independent and competent, while also experiencing a greater meaning and purpose in life, personal development and satisfying relationships with others, compared to lower scorers.45,46\nMachiavellian medical students who share these attributes may feel more confident in their ability to successfully conduct academic misbehaviour53 and/or, also due to their greater sociability skills, to help/ask others for help to commit cheating as a manipulative strategy34,52 to achieve their personal goals, disregarding the ethical costs.36\nFifth-year students were more likely to report academic misconduct compared to those in pre-clinical years. Other studies with medical students report similar findings6,12,15 and, in line with this research, also observed that academic year was a stronger predictor of cheating than age.13,14 Although some evidence7,22 supports that younger undergraduate students tend to be more likely to report academic misconduct than older ones, studies9,34,51 outside the medical field also report a positive association between academic year and cheating. In this study, fifth year students may disclose more cheating than their peers due to increased pressure in clinical years and higher competition for grades when approaching graduation.12,67 Additionally, they have been in college longer and might have developed more lenient attitudes towards cheating, while having had more opportunities to engage in such behaviour.14,68 Lastly, some of the behaviours assessed in the AMQ involved either cheating helped by others or to help others, and students that have been longer in college may have stronger social networks that they can use.15\nAcademic misbehaviour may also increase when students perceive a greater permissiveness towards cheating in their academic institution22,53 and a lower cost attached to their actions.22 In this study, perceived peer fraud was one of the strongest contributors to explain cheating, being positively associated with academic misbehaviour, while perceived severity of penalty was a negative predictor of cheating. Evidence11,12 largely supports that medical students who perceive cheating as a widespread practice among their peers are more likely to engage in such practices, possibly due to peer pressure22,69 or to avoid being in a disadvantageous position.70 In such environment, these students may also develop more lenient and neutralizing attitudes towards cheating,8,12 exacerbating the link between academic misconduct and the amoral manipulative side of Machiavellian students.65\nIn the medical field, while some evidence33 supports that relatively high levels of Machiavellianism found in medical students are likely to sustain during career progress, others32 report that these levels may gradually decrease. Although dark personality traits are relatively stable over time, recent studies64,65,71 show that the predisposition to cheat linked to Machiavellianism traits can be reduced by modifying students\u2019 attitudes (how seriously they judge cheating behaviours), perceived norms (of cheating as an acceptable practice),71 and by increasing the perceived risk of detection and punishment.64,65\nAt this level, organizational deterrence may play a useful role in countering cheating behaviour,9,13,22 increasing its effective costs and minimizing the potential benefits.65 The effective and consistent communication of academic integrity standards, through an ethics committee, ethics and academic integrity codes, where consequences for cheating are also clearly stated, alongside the implementation of a monitoring system to detect academic integrity violations, including cheating detection programs, are key to achieve that.42,70 Other preventive strategies, such as using appropriate\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S370402 DovePress Psychology Research and Behavior Management 2022:15 2102\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nassessment designs42,64 and increasing awareness and education on academic integrity42 may also contribute to disrupt the opportunity structure for misconduct.64\nAcademic institutions can promote understanding, sharing and commitment to academic integrity values by engaging the entire academic community in open and critical reflections on these matters. Furthermore, all members, including students, should be encouraged to take a more active role in implementing those values by being involved in ethics committees, policies and procedures, by teaching and learning in instructional activities and acting as role models. These may offer a better insight about ethical issues, while favouring the development of important skills to address them.1,22 Altogether, these strategies contribute to promote moral standards and rules that help discouraging normative cheating65 and moral disengagement39 which seem to mediate the relationship between Machiavellianism and academic cheating. Future research could benefit from a qualitative approach to further explore medical students\u2019 perceptions about the\nreasons behind academic misconduct such as the institutional culture, practices and commitment towards integrity values, and what strategies could be adopted to prevent misbehaviour.\nThis study has some limitations linked with data collection which relied on self-reports and covered medical students from only one Portuguese institution. This might lead to recall bias, while making it difficult to predict how generalizable the results might be to medical students in other institutions and regions."
