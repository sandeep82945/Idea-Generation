 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Investigate the anticancer activity of MRPL on other cancer cell lines such as breast, lung, prostate, etc. to determine the broad spectrum anticancer potential.

2. Conduct in vivo studies in animal models to evaluate the bioavailability, pharmacokinetics, and anticancer efficacy of MRPL compared to free MRPs. 

3. Explore modifications to the liposome composition, such as using different phospholipids or cholesterol ratios, to optimize the stability and release kinetics of MRPL.

4. Evaluate the toxicity and safety profile of MRPL through systemic toxicity studies to determine its suitability for therapeutic applications. 

5. Develop MRPL formulations for oral, topical or intravenous delivery and assess their efficacy in relevant disease models compared to conventional MRP formulations.
