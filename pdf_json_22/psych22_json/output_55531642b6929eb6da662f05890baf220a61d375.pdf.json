    "abstractText": "Background Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are traumatic events that occur before 18 years of age. ACEs have been associated with many negative health problems, including the development of chronic diseases, such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a functional gastrointestinal disorder characterized by abdominal pain. We investigated the prevalence of ACEs among patients with IBS, identified the types of ACEs commonly related to patients with IBS, and further assessed the impact of ACEs on IBS severity. Methodology A cross-sectional study was performed. The study targeted patients with IBS aged \u2265 18 years who were recruited from gastroenterology outpatient clinics at King Abdulaziz University Hospital. Adults were contacted and invited to take part in the study by completing a survey. Data were collected using two validated questionnaires, the ACE questionnaire for adults and the IBS symptom severity scoring system. Results The study included 109 patients with IBS (59.6% females). The prevalence of ACEs (patients with IBS exposed to at least one ACE) was 63.3%. The most prevalent type was emotional abuse (34.9%), followed by both physical abuse and emotional neglect (28.4%). Females reported significantly more ACEs (p=0.035) than males. The overall IBS symptoms (r = 0.195, p = 0.043) and abdominal pain (r = 0.240, p = 0.012) severity were significantly correlated with total ACEs score. Conclusions Our findings point to a probable association between ACEs exposure and IBS, demonstrating their long-term impacts on symptoms severity. Further studies are needed to acquire a better understanding of the potential impact of ACEs on IBS. Categories: Psychiatry, Psychology, Gastroenterology",

            "text": "Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) refer to stressful or traumatic events that occur during childhood before 18 years of age [1]. ACEs were first defined by the 1998 Kaiser Permanente and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention major ACE study, and the results increased interest in the consequences of ACEs on health outcomes [2]. ACEs were then classified into three categories of abuse (emotional, physical, and sexual abuse), five household challenges (household substance abuse, family violence, mentally ill household members, criminal household member, and parental separation or divorce), and two types of neglect (emotional and physical neglect) [3]. According to a national study, 80% of Saudi adults have been exposed to at least one ACE, with 29% having been exposed to four or more ACEs [4]. Furthermore, Saudi adults who had experienced four or more ACEs were at higher risk of developing diabetes, hypertension, and chronic respiratory diseases [5]. There is considerable evidence that toxic stress or frequent traumatic events can irreversibly damage the growing brain and alter the functionality of the immune, neurological, and endocrine systems. Thus, individuals who live in a stressful or toxic atmosphere will be exposed to a higher risk of chronic diseases and premature death [3]. Besides the effect on a person\u2019s health, the lifelong expenses associated with ACEs are significant. Indeed, the lifetime expenses of a person abused as a child are estimated to be approximately $210,012 [6].\nIrritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is one of the most common gastrointestinal functional disorders [7]. It is characterized by chronic, recurrent abdominal discomfort, pain, and distorted bowel habits in the absence of\nHow to cite this article Alsubaie M A, Alkhalifah H A, Ali A H, et al. (June 09, 2022) Adverse Childhood Experiences and Their Effect on Irritable Bowel Syndrome Among Saudi Arabian Adults. Cureus 14(6): e25791. DOI 10.7759/cureus.25791\nother organic gastrointestinal diseases [8]. IBS is generally categorized into four subtypes based on the individual\u2019s dominant stool pattern: IBS with constipation (IBS-C), diarrhea (IBS-D), mixed bowel habit (IBSM), and unclassified IBS (IBS-U) [9]. The etiology of IBS is unclear; however, it is assumed that the biopsychosocial model affects its development [10]. Thus, previous environmental events and psychosocial factors are considered to be crucial in its development.\nA relationship between ACEs and IBS has been established throughout the years, showing an association between the two. Previous studies have found that patients with IBS have a greater prevalence of ACEs with respect to emotional, physical, and sexual abuse than the general community [11-13]. In a recent Iranian study, emotional abuse and emotional neglect were found to be the most common ACEs encountered in patients with IBS [14].\nAlthough some studies conducted in Saudi Arabia have estimated the prevalence of ACEs and their relationship with other chronic diseases, no previous studies have linked their relationship with IBS, despite their proven association. Therefore, this study aims to 1) estimate the prevalence of ACEs among patients with IBS, 2) identify the types of ACEs most commonly associated with IBS patients, 3) compare the gender differences in the association of ACEs in patients with IBS, and 4) investigate the impact of ACEs on the severity of IBS symptoms."

No incentives were offered to the participants to take part in the study. The survey was anonymous, and the responses were treated confidentially. The survey was divided into three sections: the first section enquired about personal data (age and gender); the second evaluated ACEs exposure before 18 years of age using the ACE questionnaire for adults [15]; the third measured IBS symptom severity using the IBS Severity Scoring System (IBS-SSS) questionnaire (Appendices) [16]."

The questionnaire is available on their website [15].\nThe questionnaire consists of 10 questions covering the 10 categories of ACEs (childhood emotional, physical, and sexual abuse, emotional and physical neglect, household substance abuse, mentally ill household members, criminal household members, family violence, and parental separation or divorce). The ACE score is computed by assigning one point to each category (\u201cyes\u201d = 1 or \u201cno\u201d = 0). The 10 indicators are then summed to produce a total ACE score (ranging from 0 to 10). ACEs can therefore be labeled as either present (total ACE score \u2265 1) or absent (total ACE score = 0)."

Patients are then classified according to their total score into mild (75-175), moderate (176- 300), or severe (above 300). Patients scoring less than 75 can be considered to be in remission [16]. The questionnaire was translated into Arabic, which was then back-translated into English by two independent translators.\n2022 Alsubaie et al. Cureus 14(6): e25791. DOI 10.7759/cureus.25791 2 of 11"

            "text": "Our findings revealed that patients with a higher ACEs score experienced more severe IBS symptoms, as the total ACEs score was positively correlated with the overall IBS symptoms' severity and abdominal pain, which is consistent with the findings of similar previous studies [13,17]. This could be due to the increased\n2022 Alsubaie et al. Cureus 14(6): e25791. DOI 10.7759/cureus.25791 6 of 11\nstress response in patients with IBS having a history of ACEs (i.e., hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis dysregulation) resulting from early-life ACEs exposure [18], which contributes to stress-induced visceral hyperalgesia and intestinal mucosal barrier dysfunction [19].\nIn this study, emotional neglect and sexual abuse were significantly associated with severe IBS symptoms. The observed relationship between these types of ACEs and IBS severity can be related to their long-lasting effect because events such as sexual abuse could stick in the memory for life, affecting people\u2019s social life and mental health by altering their physiological state and increasing stress [20].\nWe also found that the prevalence of ACEs in patients with IBS was 63.3%. Compared with other studies conducted on patients with IBS, our results demonstrated an almost similar prevalence of ACEs to a German study (63.8%) [21] but it was less prevalent than an American study (75.68%) [13].\nFurthermore, females reported significantly more ACEs than male patients with IBS. This coincides with Berens et al.\u2019s study [21]. A possible cause could be that different types of ACEs are related to one gender more than the other. For example, our study results showed that females are more prone to sexual abuse (14% in females vs. 7% in males). This has also been demonstrated in other studies [11,13,21]. Other possible explanations for these results are that females are more susceptible to the effects of ACEs and, therefore, develop psychopathologies [22-23]. Others hypothesize that males and females react to stress in different ways, with females being more inclined to internalize stress symptoms (e.g., depression) and males more willing to externalize stress reactions (e.g., aggressive behavior) [24].\nMoreover, this study confirmed that females reported significantly higher family violence (34%) than males (14%). This could be due to the rising financial and social concerns among family members, which could increase the chances of exposure to various forms of abuse [25]. The Middle Eastern culture may explain this relationship, as young females in the Middle East spend more time at home. Therefore, they might witness family violence more than males, who spend most of their time outside.\nOut of the 10 ACE categories in our study, emotional abuse was found to be the most common, followed by physical abuse and emotional neglect. This correlates with the findings of an Iranian study [14]. A possible explanation for this result may be that physical and emotional abuse are widely used by parents as disciplinary methods in the Middle East. These actions can have a long-lasting effect on the child even after they grow up, which could alter their mental state and cause symptoms of depression and anxiety. The importance of this point was demonstrated in previous studies in which patients with IBS had greater levels of anxiety and depression symptoms than healthy controls [11,13,21]."

However, our study has some limitations. First, because of the nature of the cross-sectional study design, no causal inferences could be identified. Second, the questionnaire consisted of retrospective questions of ACEs; the application of this technique could result in recall bias, leading to underreporting or overreporting."

            "text": "Our findings point to a probable association between ACEs and IBS, demonstrating their long-term impacts on symptoms severity. This highlights the need to consider the harmful effects of ACEs on the development and severity of IBS. Therefore, it is important to minimize or prevent ACEs by raising awareness of their consequences and establishing children\u2019s educational programs to make them aware of the positive effects of seeking help from others. Moreover, screening for ACEs in patients with IBS should be considered. This will provide the necessary psychological therapy, if needed, to decrease gastrointestinal symptom severity. We recommend a longitudinal prospective cohort study to be conducted for a more reliable understanding of the relationship between ACEs exposure and IBS development."
