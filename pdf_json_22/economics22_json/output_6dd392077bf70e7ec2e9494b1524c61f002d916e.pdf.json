    "abstractText": "In this paper we estimate the effect of infrastructure investment on tourism demand. For this purpose, we analyse the case of the Kuelap Archaeological Complex (Peru), which became more attractive and accessible following the construction of Peru\u2019s first cable car system and the redevelopment of a nearby airport located in the city of Jaen. In order to estimate the effect of this infrastructure investment package on the number of visitors to Kuelap, we construct a synthetic control using characteristics from several archaeological sites in Peru similar to Kuelap. This synthetic control allows us to estimate the potential number of visits to Kuelap had the infrastructure investment package not been made. Thus, the causal effect is the difference between the actual visits to Kuelap and the ones to the synthetic control. The results show that the number of visits to Kuelap increased by approximately 100% in the wake of the infrastructure investment package.",

In Peru, tourism had also been an important economic activity, representing around 4% of GDP. However, since the beginning of the pandemic, tourism has been one of the most affected sectors in themajority of countries due to the closure of international borders and the restriction of non-essential activities. Thus, international tourist arrivals registered a historic contraction of 73% in 2020 and by the end of 2021 it still remains 73% below its prepandemic levels (World Tourism Organization 2022).\nAmong others, a potential strategy to speed up the recovery of tourism is by improving accessibility to places of interest, which implies building and/or renovating airports and roads, among others. Themain purpose of this paper is to estimate the causal effect that such public infrastructure investment may have on tourism demand. For this, we study the case of the Kuelap Archaeological Complex, a tourist site located in the Peruvian Amazon. Kuelap has received more visitors since the opening of the first cable car system in Peru (March 2017) and has benefited from the redevelopment of Jaen airport (one of the closest airports to the archaeological site). This has improved Kuelap\u2019s accessibility by increasing the availability of flights to and from Lima, the capital of Peru. The hypothesis of this paper is that this investment package in tourism infrastructure (the construction of the cable car system and redevelopment of the airport of Jaen) has had a significant effect on the number of visits to Kuelap.\nTo empirically evaluate this hypothesis, we use the infrastructure investment package (IIP) that benefited Kuelap as a case study and build a \u201csynthetic control\u201d unit, which is similar to Kuelap in terms of the number of visits before treatment but has not benefited from the IPP. Thus, the causal effect of the IIP (the treatment) on the number of visitors (variable of interest) to Kuelap (treated unit) is the difference in the number of visitors between Kuelap and the \u201csyntectic control\u201d unit after treatment.\nThe candidates for the control unit are all tourist sites similar to Kuelap according to the classification of theMinistry of Foreign Trade and Tourism (MINCETUR), namely all those that are classified as \u201carchaeological sites\u201d (type) and \u201cbuildings\u201d (subtype). However, given that none of these other tourist sites display a trajectory of visits similar to that of Kuelap, a synthetic control is constructed following the methodology originally proposed by Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003) and Abadie et al. (2010), and taking into account some recent developments and recommendations by Botosaru and Ferman (2019), Ferman and Pinto (2019), Ferman et al. (2020), Chernozhukov et al. (2021), Ferman and Pinto (2021), Chernozhukov et al. (2022), and Kaul et al. (2022). The baseline synthetic control is obtained by weighting the number of visits to each tourist site according to a set of relevant predictors that include only pre-treatment lags of the outcome variables and no covariates. The results show that investment in tourism infrastructure has significantly increased the number of visits to Kuelap since 2017. In particular, it is estimated that this investment package doubled the number of visits to Kuelap. Robustness exercises, related to the elimination of sites that were affected by a weather phenomenon known as El Ni\u00f1o and the inclusion of covariates related to tourism development (such as proportion of domestic tourists and guests per accommodation, among others), do not change the main results.\nThe literature on tourism as an economic activity has focused on the analysis of its relationshipwith economic growth. The tourism-led growth hypothesis has been one of the most studied in this literature (for instance, Risso and Brida 2009; Rodr\u00edguez et al. 2014; Banerjee et al. 2015, 2016; Faber and Gaubert 2019) and has been empirically assessed using mainly time series econometric techniques (such as cointegration and Granger causality tests). Another branch of the literature has been devoted to the analysis of the relationship between public policies and tourism (Rodr\u00edguez et al. 2014; Imikan and Ekpo 2012, among others), and the study of the relationship between public investment in transport infrastructure and tourism (\u00c1lvarez-D\u00edaz et al. 2019; Monterrubio et al. 2020; Kanwal et al. 2020, among others). However, there are few empirical studies that estimate the causal effect of public investment on tourism (for example Deng et al. 2019; Doerr et al. 2020; Chow et al. 2021; Albalate et al. 2022; Shu et al. 2022), and none that analyse the causal effect of the construction of a cable car system on tourism.\nAs far as we know, this is the first paper that estimates the impact of public investment in tourism infrastructure on tourism demand for the Peruvian case. Also, our research contributes to the scarce literature that employs a comparative case study with a synthetic control to study the causal effect of public investment in infrastructure on tourism. Finally, it is the first paper that analyses the causal effect of the construction of a cable car system on tourism.\nThe rest of this paper is organised into six sections. Section1 presents a brief review of the economic literature on tourism. Section2 describes the main stylized facts associated with the investment in tourism infrastructure that has led to an increase in visits to Kuelap. Section3 presents the empirical methodology used to evaluate the hypothesis of interest. The data are described in Sect. 4. The results are presented and discussed in Sect. 5. Finally, the conclusions are presented in Sect. 6."

            "text": "The economic literature on tourism has focused on its long-run relationship with economic growth, the so-called tourism-led growth hypothesis. Most of this literature provides evidence of a positive impact of tourism on different economic variables, such as the accumulation of foreign reserves, investment and employment, among others. Empirically, this relationship has been analysed using time series econometric techniques such as cointegration andGranger causality.1 For instance, Risso and Brida (2009) analyse the contribution of tourism to Chilean economic growth and find that tourism is an important determinant of long-run economic growth; in particular, they estimate that the elasticity of tourism expenditure with respect to real GDP is 0.8 in the long run. Based on the existing literature on tourism and growth using time series, Brida et al. (2013) conclude that tourism Granger causes long-term economic growth; however, they warn that this result should be validated with regional and country-level studies. Along these lines, Faber and Gaubert (2019) study the case of Mexico and show that tourism has a positive economic effect in the long run, both at the local level (municipalities) and at the country level.\n1 See Brida et al. (2013) for a summary.\nAnother branch of the literature focuses on the analysis of the relationship between public policies and tourism. Rodr\u00edguez et al. (2014) provide evidence of a long-run relationship between public investment in advertising and tourism demand in the Andalusia, Spain; furthermore, they show that advertising investment helps to predict tourist demand in the short run. Imikan andEkpo (2012) study the relationship between investment in different types of infrastructure (water, electricity and transport, among others) and tourism development for the case of River State, Nigeria. Using multiple correlation and stepwise regression analysis, they find that investment in transport infrastructure is highly correlated with tourism development. Gulcan et al. (2009) study the relationship between public investment and value added created by hotels in the Aegean region of Turkey; using a panel data regression model they find that public investment in tourism has a positive effect on hotel activity.More recently, Deng et al. (2019) estimate the causal effect of a regional policy in western China (Western Development Strategy or WDS) on tourism using a quasi-experiment. Specifically, they use a sharp regression discontinuity design where the distance of each city from the geographical boundary of the WDS determines the point of discontinuity. The results ofDeng et al. (2019) indicate that theWDSpolicy,which includes infrastructure projects, has had a positive effect on the development of tourism in China.\nThe recent literature has shown that investment in tourism infrastructure plays an important role in the development of this sector, promoting sustainable investment policies (Paramati et al. 2018) and cutting through the entire value chain of the tourism sector: transport and communications, hotel industry, restaurants and recreational facilities (Nguyen 2021). One area of this research has focused specifically on the relationship between transport infrastructure and the development of the tourism industry based on investments in different types of transport links including by air (airports and cable cars), land, and rail.\nThe relationship between air transport and tourism has received considerable attention in the academic literature and among policy makers. Papatheodorou (2021) identifies three types of relevant contributions to the study of tourist air transport: (a) airline business models and regional tourism development, (b) the link between aeropolitics and tourism, and (c) the airline\u2013airport relationship and the development of tourist routes (for example, Benedetti et al. 2012; Jian et al. 2017; Fern\u00edndez et al. 2018;\u00c1lvarez-D\u00edaz et al. 2019;Monterrubio et al. 2020, among others). Likewise, land transport infrastructure constitutes an important driver for the dynamism of tourism, generating the development of new tourist sites and motivating the support of local residents towards this activity. For example, Kanwal et al. (2020) demonstrates that the road infrastructure of the China\u2013Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is positively related to community support for tourism. On the other hand, investment in high-speed rails (HSR) and its relationship with the tourism industry have been extensively studied, demonstrating that improvements in accessibility as a consequence of HSR lead to increased demand for tourism (Yin et al. 2019; Delaplace et al. 2014; Bazin et al. 2011; Kurihara Wu 2016).\nResearch suggests that investment in transport infrastructure is associated with increased visitor numbers and consequently tourism development. However, there are less empirical studies that estimate the causal effect of investment in infrastructure on tourism. Recent studies have used difference-in-differences, instrumental variable\nand synthetic control approaches to estimate the effect of airport subsidies and HSR on the number of visitors, the development of national tourism and the efficiency of the tourism industry (Chow et al. 2021; Albalate et al. 2022; Shu et al. 2022). For instance, Doerr et al. (2020) employing a synthetic control approach and using data from Germany conclude that the new airport infrastructure promotes regional tourism development, due to the increase in tourist arrivals and income generated from this activity.\nRegarding research on cable car systems and tourism, the literature is scarce. Zhang et al. (2009) reports on visitors\u2019 impressions of using a cable car in Wulingyuan (China), but finds that tourists\u2019 motivations are focused on landscape aspects and not on the transportation experience. In a paper not directly related to tourism, Martinez et al. (2018) use instrumental variables to identify the causal effect of the cable car in La Paz, Bolivia, on the choice of mode of transport, the use of time, and employment; the results show significant benefits for the users of this type of transportation.\nOur study uses a synthetic control approach to estimate the causal effect on tourism demand of the construction of the first cable car system in Peru and the reconstruction of a nearby airport - an investment package on tourism infrastructure. Thus, this paper contributes to the existing literature in three ways. As far as we know, this is the first paper that estimates the impact of public investment in tourism infrastructure on tourism demand for the Peruvian case. Second, our research contributes to the scarce literature that employs a comparative case study with a synthetic control to study the causal effect of public investment in infrastructure on tourism. Finally, it is the first paper that analyses the causal effect of the construction of a cable car system on tourism."

One of its main tourist attractions is the Kuelap Archaeological Complex or simply Kuelap, located at a distance of approximately 107kms from Chachapoyas, the capital of Amazonas. Kuelap is the most important archaeological site of the Chachapoyas culture (fifth\u2013sixteenth century). It is located on a limestone mountain at 3000ms above sea level, on the left bank of the Utcubamba River. The site occupies an area of approximately 6 hectares, surrounded by a perimeter wall of 15ms height, and is built with heavy but finely edged limestone. Across the plateau there are more than 550 circular structures with different architectural functions (Ministry of Foreign Trade and Tourism 2017). Peru has 23 archaeological sites displaying similar characteristics to Kuelap, including Machu Picchu, Chavin de Huantar and Caral, among others (Ministry of Foreign Trade and Tourism 2019).\n2 This tourist circuit also includes Cajamarca, La Libertad, Lambayeque and San Martin."

On August 26, 2005, the public investment project (PIP) denominated \u201cImplementation of Cable Cars between the town of Tingo Nuevo and theKuelap-Amazonas Fortress\u201d was registered. Its main goal was to reduce travel time and improve the quality of transport to reach Kuelap. In March 2013, under an inter-institutional collaboration agreement with MINCETUR, The Peruvian FinanceMinistry\u2019s InvestmentAgency (ProInversion)was put in charge of undertaking feasibility studies and developing a project proposal as a public\u2013private partnership or PPP (Rodr\u00edguez et al. 2018). Table 1 details the main milestones in the process of development and construction of the first cable car system of Peru.\nThe project was awarded to a French-Peruvian consortium in May 2014. Construction works started in August 2015 and led to a reduction in tourism activity, especially between August and December 2015, because traffic through the site\u2019s access road was severely restricted. (During the day the road was open for just three hours.) In addition, maintenance work at the archaeological site meant that visits to some areas of the fortress were restricted. The opening ceremony of Peru\u2019s first cable car line was in July 2016 and after a trial period full operations started in March 2017. According to Ministry of Economy and Finance (2017), the final cost of the construction of the cable car system was approximately US$ 27 million (S/ 89.2 millions). The project file projected a 50% increase in tourists during the cable car\u2019s first ten years of operation; however, the actual number of visitors has been twice this forecast, increasing from 40,146 in 2014 to 102,905 in 2017. A simple cost-benefit analysis provided by Rodr\u00edguez et al. (2018) shows that the this outcome resulted in a reduction of costs of the cable car system of approximately US 370,000 during 2017.

Travel times to Kuelap by car from Chachapoyas and Jaen take 3h and 7h, respectively.

            "text": "A comparative case study is an empirical approach used to measure the causal effect of an event, treatment or intervention (e.g. the enforcement of a policy or law) on a variable of interest when it is not possible to apply an experimental design. To implement a comparative case study, \u201cunits\u201d (cities, regions, locations, etc.) exposed to an event (treatment, shock, etc.) and others not exposed to the event are required, and all units must be similar before treatment.5\nWe employ a comparative case study where Kuelap is the \u201ctreated\u201d unit, investment in tourism infrastructure is the \u201ctreatment\u201d and the number of visits to Kuelap is the variable of interest or the outcome variable. Let YTt represent the number of visitors to Kuelap in period t , for t = 1, 2, . . . , T , T + 1, . . . , T \u2217, and assume that the treatment occurs in period t = T + 1, so there are T preintervention or pre-treatment periods. To estimate the effect of the treatment on the treated unit, we need a control unit that replicates its counterfactual, YCt , i.e. the evolution of visits to Kuelap had the treatment not occurred. Then, the causal effect of the treatment is the difference between the number of visitor numbers to the treated unit, YTt , and its counterfactual, Y C t , after treatment, i.e. YTt \u2212 YCt for all t > T . Natural candidates for a single control unit are any of the tourist sites that have the same Mincetur classification as Kuelap: archaeological sites/buildings. However, it is possible that none of those sites provides a close enoughmatch to be a valid control.6 In this case,Abadie andGardeazabal (2003) andAbadie et al. (2010) proposed the use of a \u201csynthetic control\u201d to approximate YCt , which is a weighted average of all J potential control units or donor pool. In order to be a valid estimate of the counterfactual, the synthetic control must satisfy two conditions. First, the synthetic control unit and Kuelap should display a similar number of visits before the intervention (for all t < T +1). Second, the synthetic control unit and Kuelap should be similar in terms of the preintervention values of the \u201cpredictors\u201d of the number of visits. The predictors may include L lagged values of the visits to Kuelap (or linear combination of those values) and other M variables that can help predicting those visits, which are referred to as \u201ccovariates\u201d, so that the total number of predictors is K = L + M .\nEstimation\nA synthetic control for Kuelap can be constructed by \u201coptimally\u201d weighting all the available sites. Formally, for each archaeological site j = 1, 2 . . . , J that is part of the donor pool, we define a vector y j of dimension T \u00d71 that contains the number of visits to archaeological site j along the preintervention periods (T periods). The synthetic control of Kuelap, y\u2217, is defined as the vector of visits that results from \u201coptimally\u201d weighting each y j using weights w\u22171, w\u22172, . . . , w\u2217J :\n5 If all units were exposed to the event, the level of exposure is required to be very different between the treated and the control group. 6 Our analysis showed that none of the other sites in Peru were a close enough match to use as a control.\ny\u2217 = y1 \u00b7 w\u22171 + . . . + y j \u00b7 w\u2217j + . . . + yJ \u00b7 w\u2217J = Y0w\u2217 (1)\nwhere w\u2217j represents the optimal weight of the archaeological site j in the synthetic control of Kuelap, Y0 is a matrix of order T \u00d7 J whose columns are y1, y2, . . . , yJ , and w\u2217 = [w\u22171, w\u22172, . . . , w\u2217J ]\u2032 is a vector of order J \u00d7 1 whose elements are weights that add up to one, w\u22171 + w\u22172 + . . . + w\u2217J = 1.\nThe choice of optimal weights is made such that the resulting synthetic control replicates as close as possible the preintervention values of all the K predictors of visits to Kuelap. Kaul et al. (2022) call this procedure the \u201cinner optimization\u201d process and can be formalised as follows. Let x be a vector of order (K \u00d7 1) containing the pre-treatment values of the K predictors and x j the corresponding vector for each archaeological site j , for j = 1, 2, 3, . . . , J ; let X0 be a (K \u00d7 J ) matrix whose columns are the vectors x1, x2, . . . , xJ . In addition, let V be a matrix whose values reflect the relative importance of each predictor (i.e. the weights of the predictors), which will be determined by a second procedure that Kaul et al. (2022) refer to as the \u201couter optimization\u201d. Then, for a given V matrix, the vector of optimal weights w\u2217 is chosen to minimize the weighted distance between x and X0w, subject to the fact that the weights are nonnegative and they sum up to 1:\nMin w (x \u2212 X0w)\u2032V (x \u2212 X0w) s.t. w j \u2265 0 , j = 1, 2, . . . , J\nw1 + w2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 + wJ = 1 (2)\nThe solution to this problem is the vector w\u2217(V ) = [w\u22171, w\u22172, . . . , w\u2217J ]\u2032, which defines the synthetic control unit for Kuelap y\u2217 = y1 \u00b7w\u22171+. . .+ y j \u00b7w\u2217j +. . .+ yJ \u00b7w\u2217J , for a givenmatrix V . The next step consists of obtaining the optimal predictor weights, V \u2217, which is achieved by the so-called \u201couter optimization\u201d. Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003) and Abadie et al. (2010) proposed to choose a positive definite and diagonal matrix V such that the synthetic control optimally replicates the trajectory of visits to Kuelap before treatment. Specifically, V \u2217 is the matrix that solves the following minimisation problem:\nMin V\n(z \u2212 Z0w\u2217(V ))\u2032(z \u2212 Z0w\u2217(V )) (3)\nwhere z is a (m \u00d7 1) vector containing all the preintervention values of the visits to Kuelap, Z0 is a (m\u00d7 J )matrix with columns z1, z2, . . . , z J , and z j is a (m\u00d71) vector containing all the preintervention values of the visits to site j for j = 1, 2, . . . , J . An alternative way to obtain the predictor weights contained in V a regression-based method as in Bohn et al. (2014).\nAbadie et al. (2010) justify the use of the synthetic control method in a comparative case study under certain conditions. First, the intervention has no effect on the outcome variable before it is implemented; however, the anticipation of the intervention may affect preintervention outcomes, in which case the treatment period can be redefined and include the affected periods. Second, the outcomes of the untreated units are not\naffected by the intervention. However, if the pre-treatment fit of the synthetic control is poor (compared to the actual pre-treatment outcome variable), then Abadie et al. (2010) do not recommend the use of a synthetic control.\nA synthetic control allows the presence of unobserved confounders that vary over time. To see this formally, Abadie et al. (2010) assume that the outcome that would be observed for site i in period t in the absence of the treatment, Y Nit is described by the following factor model:\nY Nit = \u03b4t + \u03b8tCi + \u03bbt\u03bci + \u03b5i t (4)\nwhere \u03b4t is an unknown common factor that varies with constant factor loadings across units, Ci is a (K \u00d7 1) vector of observed covariates (not affected by the intervention), \u03b8t is a (1 \u00d7 K ) vector of unknown parameters, \u03bbt is a (1 \u00d7 F) vector of unobserved common factors that varies over time, \u03bci is an (F \u00d71) vector of unknown factor loadings, and \u03b5i t represents unobserved idiosyncratic, transitory shocks with mean zero.\nEquation (4) is a generalization of the difference-in differences (DID) model with fixed effects: If \u03bbt is constant for all t , then Eq. (4) reduces to the DID fixed-effects model. Thus, the DID model allows for the presence of unobserved confounders \u03bci but restrict their effect to be constant over time if \u03bbt = \u03bb; thus, the confounders can be eliminated using the first difference transformation. In contrast, the synthetic control allows the effect of confounding unobserved characteristics to vary over time and, when the pre-treatment fit is very good, it provides an unbiased estimator of Y Nit for the treated unit i .\nHowever, in many applications, the pre-treatment fit is imperfect. Ferman and Pinto (2021) study the properties of the synthetic control, a demeaned version of the synthetic control, and theDIDestimatorwhen the pre-treatment fit is imperfect andprovide some conditions under which those estimators can used with confidence. For instance, if the synthetic control unit recovers the levels of the treated unit and the preintervention fit is imperfect, then the synthetic control would be reliable if there is no important unobserved confounders that vary over time. In this case, if the DID and synthetic control provide similar results, then Ferman and Pinto (2021) suggest that the synthetic control is a good choice.\nAs discussed by Ferman et al. (2020), there is lack of consensus about which predictors should be used in synthetic control applications. The standard practice is to use pre-treatment outcomes and covariates and to construct the synthetic control trying to balance at least on a long set of pre-treatment outcomes (Botosaru and Ferman 2019). Usually, linear combinations of preintervention outcomes are used as predictors, but there is no formal recommendation about it. If there are no good reasons to include covariates in the application, Ferman et al. (2020) recommend the use of the specification including all pre-treatment periods, given that it minimizes the root mean squared error (RMSE) in the pre-treatment period, and it is not subject to the choice of arbitrary pre-treatment outcome lags as predictors. On the other hand, the only reason not to use all pre-treatment periods is when there are good reasons to include covariates. In this case, it is recommended to use a specification that does not include all pre-treatment lags, otherwise all covariates would be irrelevant in the\nestimation of weights, as documented by Kaul et al. (2022): even though the inner optimization takes into account the covariates, the synthetic control obtained from the outer optimization will ignore all the covariates when all the pre-intervention values of the outcome variable are used as predictors.\nBased on the above discussion about the synthetic control method, our baseline synthetic control will be constructed using as predictors all the pre-treatment lags and no covariates, givenwe have limited economic information for each specific site. Then, the robustness of the results will be analysed by including covariates and taking into account the effect of the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon in the donor pool and in the synthetic control unit.\nInference\nOne way to evaluate the significance and robustness of these estimates is to analyse whether the results could have been obtained by chance. In other words, how often would we have obtained an effect on visits of the estimated magnitude had we chosen an archaeological control site at random. To address these questions, Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003) and Abadie et al. (2010) proposed the use of \u201cplacebo tests\u201d. It consists of applying the same methodology to tourist sites that did not experience any treatment (investment package) similar to Kuelap and analysing the resulting gap for each site, where the gap is defined as the difference between the actual number of visits and its synthetic counterpart. If any of the \u201cplacebos\u201d create gaps of similar magnitude to those estimated for Kuelap, then we would conclude that there is no significant evidence of a positive effect of Kuelap\u2019s infrastructure investment package. However, if none of the placebos show a positive gap as significant as the one associated with Kuelap, we can conclude that there is a positive and statistically significant effect of the infrastructure investment package.\nIn order to evaluate Kuelap\u2019s gap relative to the gaps obtained from the placebos obtained for each site, we follow Abadie et al. (2010) and analyse the distribution of the ratios of post/pre-intervention mean squared prediction errors (MSPE). The MSPE of site j is defined as the average of the squared difference between the number of visits to site j and its synthetic counterpart. If the synthetic control for Kuelap is such that the pre-treatment MSPE is zero and the post-treatment MSPE is large in magnitude, then the estimated gap reflects the effect of the investment package on the number of visitors to Kuelap. In particular, if the ratio \u201cpost-treatment MSPE / pretreatment MSPE\u201d (RMSPE) for Kuelap is the highest compared to the rest of sites, then the estimated effect is statistically significant: if a site was chosen at random, then the chances of obtaining a RMSPE as high as Kuelap\u2019s would be approximately 1/J , which represents the p-value to test the null hypothesis of no significant effect of the treatment. Recently, some alternative inference methods for synthetic control analysis have been proposed, such as conformal inference (Chernozhukov et al. 2021) and t-test (Chernozhukov et al. 2022). In this paper our inference results of will be based on the approach proposed by Abadie et al. (2010)."

Given that the difference between the visits to Kuelap and the synthetic control is positive in 2017 (when the cable car system started to operate) and 2018, we can conclude that the investment package had a positive effect on the number of visits to Kuelap.\nThe top part of Table 7 displays the number of visits to Kuelap, Cumbemayo and SCA during the treatment period from which the causal effect of the infrastructure investment package can be calculated. It can be observed that the investment package\nhad a negative impact during the first year of construction of the cable car system, due to the restriction in access to the Archaeological Complex related to the construction works; this is reflected by a gap (difference between actual and synthetic control visits) of -4668 visitors in 2015. However, the gap became positive in 2016 by 10,160 visitors and then was more than double in 2017 and 2018 (105% and 117%, respectively). Specifically, the estimated causal effect of the investment package on the number of visits to Kuelap is 52,610 visitors in 2017 and 59,612 visitors in 2018. On average, the estimated causal effect is 55,935 which is statistically significant at the 5% level (p-value = 0.048).\nFor comparison purposes, the bottom part of Table 7 displays the estimated causal effect using the difference-in-differences (DID) estimator and robust standard errors as suggested by Ferman and Pinto (2019) when there is only one treated group. The DID estimator is positive (43,931 visitors) and statistically significant at the 10% level (p-value = 0.052). This effect is smaller than the estimated effect obtained with the synthetic control (A) but greater than the one obtained with Cumbemayo (34,889 visitors). However, the DID control unit does not replicate well the preintervention number of visits, as it is evident from Fig. 5.\nFigure6 illustrates the statistical significance of the causal effect using the \u201cplacebo tests\u201d proposed by Abadie and Gardeazabal (2003) and Abadie et al. (2010) and discussed in Sect. 3. The figure displays the estimated gap for Kuelap and placebo\nTable 5 Synthetic control: Weights for each archaeological site\nPredictors Kuelap Cumbemayo Synthetic control A Synthetic control B\nVisits in 2008 17,396 30,580 17,448 17,698\nVisits in 2009 18,542 21,701 18,618 18,080\nVisits in 2010 23,696 27,810 23,723 23,855\nVisits in 2011 29,431 33,636 29,246 28,832\nVisits in 2012 27,960 25,155 28,022 28,396\nVisits in 2013 33,495 42,965 33,555 33,584\nVisits in 2014 40,146 62,961 40,136 40,196\ngaps for other archaeological sites that did not experience a similar investment package in tourism infrastructure as Kuelap did during the period of analysis.8 It is clear that the positive gap for Kuelap is highly unusual and that its magnitude is the largest compared to the rest of the other sites. This is confirmed by the ratio of mean squared\n8 Moray and Nikan are excluded as they have the largest predictive errors in the placebo studies."

            "text": "In 2017, several regions of the country were adversely affected by the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon. According to the National Emergency Operations Center (COEN), Piura, Lambayeque, La Libertad, Ancash and Lima were the departments that registered the greatest damage ( Radio Programas del Per\u00fa (2017)). This event caused a decrease in visits to tourist sites within these regions which could reduce the number of visits to the synthetic control, especially if they have an important weight (for example, Huaca Brujo), and thus lead to a larger difference between actual visits and synthetic control and thus to an upward bias in the estimated causal effect. In order to avoid this potential bias, we re-estimated the synthetic control excluding the archaeological sites located in departments affected by the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon in 2017. Figure8, which displays monthly visits to these places between 2015 and 2017, shows a drop in visits during March, April and May 2017 compared to the same period in previous years.\nThe last column of Table 5 displays the weights of each site used to construct the alternative synthetic Kuelap excluding those site affected by El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, which we call synthetic control (B) or SCB. The SCB is a weighted average of six sites: Kotosh (weight of 0.27), Cumbemayo (weight of 0.23), Intihuatana (weight of 0.23), Wari (weight of 0.17), Choquequirao (weight of 0.08) and Raqchi (weight of 0.02); the rest of the sites have zero weight in the synthetic control. It is worth noting that all sites not affected by El Ni\u00f1o that contribute to SCA remain in the SCB.\nThe last column of Table 6 displays the pre-treatment visits to the SCB. A simple comparison indicates that the SCA\u2019s pre-treatment visits are very similar to SCB\u2019s. Figure9 shows the trajectory of visits to Kuelap and the synthetic controls (A) and (B), for the period 2008\u20132018. It is clear that the SCB replicates almost perfectly the preintervention visits to Kuelap as SCA does. However, as expected, the SCB\u2019s gap is positive but smaller than the SCA\u2019s gap because we are excluding sites adversely affected by El Ni\u00f1o. Again, it is evident that the investment package had a positive effect on the number of visits to Kuelap.\nThe last column of the top part of Table 7 displays the number of visits to SCB during the treatment period. Similar to the case of SCA, it can be observed that the investment package had a negative impact during the first year of construction of the cable car system, which is reflected by a gap of -7488 visitors in 2015. However, the gap became positive in 2016 by 6785 visitors and then almost double in 2017 and 2018. Specifically, the estimated causal effect of the investment package on the number of visits to Kuelap is 46,367 visitors in 2017 and 53,643 visitors in 2018. On average, the estimated causal effect is 50,005 which is statistically significant at the 10% level (p-value = 0.071). As expected, in 2017 and 2018 the SCB\u2019s gap is smaller than SCA\u2019s gap because we are excluding sites adversely affected by El Ni\u00f1o. Again, the results indicate that the investment package in tourism infrastructure has had a positive and significant effect on the number of visitors to Kuelap."

            "text": "The second robustness analysis we undertake is the estimation of the synthetic control using covariates. The results are displayed in Tables 8 and 9.\nAs discussed in Sect. 3, when there exists uncertainty as to which covariates to include, then it is advisable to construct the synthetic control using the preintervention visits as the only predictors (Ferman et al. 2020; Kaul et al. 2022). In our case, the lack of reliable site-level data for potential predictors is the main limitation for not adding covariates in the baseline synthetic control.\nHowever, we estimate alternative synthetic controls in order to check if the results remain stable. First, we estimate a synthetic control adding as a covariate the number of domestic tourists as percentage of the total number of tourists (domestic visitors), which is the only covariate with information specific to each site. The second specification includes more covariates: average length of stay in accommodation facilities (length of stay), number of guests per accommodation facility (guests per accommodation), participation of tourism in GDP (tourism development), average level of education achieved by people above the age of 15 (educational attainment) and average annual temperature (regional temperature). We add covariates to both SCA and SCB.\nAs seen in Table 9, the weights of the synthetic control (A) do not change when one or more covariates are added, as is formally shown by Kaul et al. (2022). This\nTable 8 Synthetic control: Weights for each archaeological site .

Also, the values of Kuelap\u2019s covariates are very similar to those of the alternative synthetic controls, as displayed in Table 9. Finally, the estimated causal effects are very similar to those of the baseline SCA and SCB. Overall, the results show strong evidence that the investment package in tourism infrastructure has had a positive causal effect on the number of visitors to Kuelap."

We analysed the case of the Kuelap Archaeological Complex, which has become more attractive and accessible after the construction of the first cable car system in Peru and the redevelopment of Jaen airport. For this purpose, we applied a comparative case study with a \u201csynthetic control\u201d, which was built using information from other similar archaeological sites in Peru. The results show that investment in tourism infrastructure generated an increase of approximately 100% in the number of visits to Kuelap, twice the initial forecast.\nTable 9 Synthetic control units .

Thus, investment in tourism infrastructure could contribute to overcoming the negative economic consequences of the Covid-19 pandemic. Choquequirao, located in the Cusco region and long considered the second Machu Picchu, is an archaeological site that has been attracting more tourists in recent years; however, the lack of accessibility to this place limits its potential for development and a significant increase in visitor numbers.
