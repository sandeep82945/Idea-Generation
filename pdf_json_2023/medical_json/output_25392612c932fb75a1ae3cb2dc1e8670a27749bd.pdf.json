New NICE guidelines now recommend that these groups of people should be offered a comprehensive assessment for bariatric surgery without the requirement for all non-surgical interventions to have been tried first, or for patients to already be under the management of a tier 3 service. The guidelines also provide an evidence-based list of significant health conditions that canbe improvedbybariatric surgery,whichwill help clinicians make decisions about who to offer an assessment to, and recommendations on what the assessment for surgery should include.\nThis article summarises updated recommendations published in July 2023, referring to the updated NICE guidance on weight management.1 These guidelines update the previously published guidelines on management of obesity, first published in 2006 and updated in 2014.2"

            "text": "NICE recommendations are based on systematic reviews of best available evidence and explicit consideration of cost effectiveness. When minimal evidence is available, recommendations are based on the guideline committee\u2019s experience andopinion of what constitutes good practice. Evidence levels for the recommendations are given in italics in square brackets. Definitions of evidence certainty are given in box 1.\nBox 1: GRADE Working Group grades of evidence\n\u2022 High certainty\u2014We are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect\n\u2022 Moderate certainty\u2014We are moderately confident in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different\n\u2022 Low certainty\u2014Our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may be substantially different from the estimate of the effect\n\u2022 Very low certainty\u2014We have very little confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect\nReferral for bariatric surgery assessment The guideline committee agreed that\u2014based on very low to moderate quality evidence from eight randomised controlled trials, seven observational studies, andone systematic review\u2014bariatric surgery was effective for improving a range of obesity related outcomes (weight loss, BMI,mortality) in peoplewith a BMI of \u226540. The effectiveness of surgery was also shown in people with a BMI ranging between 35 and 39.9 with obesity related comorbidities, including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, idiopathic intracranial hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, obstructive sleep apnoea, and type 2 diabetes. Four cost utility analyses from the UK also demonstrated the cost effectiveness of bariatric surgery in these groups.\nFor patients with a BMI ranging between 35 and 39.9 with obesity related comorbidities, a non-exhaustive list of comorbidities is included in the recommendationsbasedon the specific evidence that was found during the guidelines review process. In addition to the comorbidities identified, bariatric surgerymay improve outcomes for peoplewith other comorbidities forwhich the evidencebase is currently uncertain, includingasthma,hypercholesterolaemia, or infertility.\nOffering bariatric surgery only to people who had first tried all \u201cappropriatenon-surgical interventions\u201d creates an unjustified barrier to a clinically and cost effective intervention and creates variation in practice.2 A \u201cGetting it Right First Time\u201d (GIRFT) report published in 2017 highlighted that, although overall surgical activity had increased due to the higher prevalence of obesity, only 0.6% of potential surgical activity was being delivered and that access to surgery varied widely across the country.3 A national mapping report commissioned by Public Health England in 2015 also highlighted that tier 3\n1the bmj | BMJ 2023;382:p1880 | doi: 10.1136/bmj.p1880\nPRACTICE\n1 National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, City Tower, Manchester M1 4BT, UK\n2 Norwich Medical School, University of East Anglia, Norwich NR4 7TJ, UK\n3 St George\u2019s University of London, Cranmer Terrace, London SW17 0RE, UK\nCorrespondence to: A Gildea anthony.gildea@nice.org.uk\nCite this as: BMJ 2023;382:p1880\nhttp://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.p1880\nPublished: 29 August 2023\ncopyright. on 13 January 2024 at Indian Institute of T\nechnology P atna (IIT P atna).

D ow nloaded from\nservices were only available in some parts of the country, therefore people outside of those areas were facing an unjustified barrier to treatment, exacerbating regional health inequalities (box 2).5 The guideline committee therefore decided to remove this requirement from the new recommendation.\nBox 2: NHS tiered care weight management pathway (adapted from Obesity Empowerment Network4)\n\u2022 Tier 1\u2014Universal services (such as public health or population-wide interventions)\n\u2022 Tier 2\u2014Community multicomponent weight management services \u2022 Tier 3\u2014Specialist weight management services (providing non-surgical\nintensive medical management with a multidisciplinary team) \u2022 Tier 4\u2014Specialist weight management services (providing surgical\nand non-surgical management with a multidisciplinary team)\nThe guideline committee acknowledged that, due to variations in commissioning arrangements, preoperative assessment for bariatric surgery may lie within the remit of a tier 3 or a tier 4 service. In the guideline, the term specialist weight management service has been used to describe tier 3 and tier 4 services.1\nAlthough no specific evidence was found for the effectiveness of surgery in people of South Asian, Chinese, other Asian, Middle Eastern, Black African, or African-Caribbean family background, it is recognised that people from these groups are prone to central adiposity and their cardiometabolic risk occurs at a lower BMI than in people from other family backgrounds. Therefore, the guideline committee agreed that people from these groups should be considered for an assessment for surgery at a lower threshold.\n\u2022 Offer adults a referral for a comprehensive assessment by specialist weight management services providing multidisciplinarymanagement of obesity to seewhether bariatric surgery is suitable for them, if they:\n\u2010 Have a BMI of \u226540, or between 35 and 39.9 with a significant health condition that could be improved if they lost weight (see box 3 for examples) and\n\u2010 Agree to the necessary long term follow-up after surgery (for example, lifelong annual reviews).\n\u2022 Consider referral for people of SouthAsian, Chinese, otherAsian, Middle Eastern, Black African, or African-Caribbean family background using a lower BMI threshold (reduced by 2.5) than in recommendation above, to account for the fact that these groups are prone to central adiposity and their cardiometabolic risk occurs at lower BMI.\n[Based on very low tomoderate quality evidence from randomised controlled trials and observational studies and published cost utility analyses evaluating the cost effectiveness of bariatric surgery in the UK]\nBox 3: Examples of common health conditions that could be improved by bariatric surgery\n\u2022 Cardiovascular disease \u2022 Hypertension \u2022 Idiopathic intracranial hypertension \u2022 Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease with or without steatohepatitis \u2022 Obstructive sleep apnoea \u2022 Type 2 diabetes\nThese examples are based on the evidence identified for this guideline, and the list is not exhaustive.\nSpecialist weight management service and multidisciplinary assessment The guideline committee agreed that, although bariatric surgery is effective for weight loss and can improve comorbidities, there are also potentialmedical, nutritional, surgical, andpsychological risks or complications that can arise from the procedure. The committee also noted that there is a current lack of service provision for assessments for bariatric surgery and variation in practice across the country.\nBecauseof variations in commissioningarrangements, pre-operative assessment for bariatric surgery may lie within the remit of a specialist weight management service (tier 3 or a tier 4 service). Within the guideline, a specialist weight management service is defined as a specialist primary, community, or secondary care multidisciplinary team offering a combination of surgical, dietetic, pharmacological, and psychological obesity management interventions, including but not limited to tier 3 and tier 4 services. To incorporate this new definition, the updated guideline recommends that amultidisciplinary teamwithin a specialistweight management service should include or have access to health and social care professionals with expertise in conducting medical, nutritional, surgical, andpsychological assessments inpeople living with obesity, and be able to assess whether surgery is suitable.\nAssessment for surgery should also include how to support people to access bariatric surgery. Part of the assessment should include a discussion around what previous attempts people have made to manage their weight and their response to treatment. Although \u201chaving triedall appropriatenon-surgical interventions\u201d is no longer a requirement of the new recommendations, discussing someone\u2019s weight management history with them may help the multidisciplinary team understand how much support is needed, what support has previously been lacking, or any barriers to treatment a person may have faced. These discussions will also contribute to shared decision making about potential treatment options (including bariatric surgery). The guideline committee agreed that the assessment should actively consider the needs of anypopulations affected byhealth inequalities, such as peoplewith learning or neurodevelopmental disabilities, including any factors thatmayaffect their response after surgery ormay require additional specialist support.\n\u2022 Ensure the multidisciplinary team within a specialist weight management service includes or has access to health and social care professionals who have expertise in conducting medical, nutritional, psychological, and surgical assessments in people living with obesity, and are able to assess whether surgery is suitable.\n\u2022 Carry out a comprehensive, multidisciplinary assessment for bariatric surgery based on the person\u2019s needs. As part of this, assess:\n\u2010 The person\u2019s medical needs (for example, existing comorbidities)\n\u2010 The person\u2019s nutritional status (for example, dietary intake and eating habits and behaviours)\n\u2010 Anypsychological needs that, if addressed,wouldhelp ensure surgery is suitable and support adherence to postoperative care requirements\nthe bmj | BMJ 2023;382:p1880 | doi: 10.1136/bmj.p18802\non 13 January 2024 at Indian Institute of T echnology P atna (IIT P atna).

For patients in whom surgery is unsuitable or for those who decline surgery, alternative weight management services and interventionswill need tobe explored,whichmay result in increased referrals to other multidisciplinary services.\nUptake for bariatric surgery may also increase among people of ethnic minority family backgrounds given the lower BMI thresholds recommended to be used for people from these groups. This will broaden the population of people who can benefit from bariatric surgery and help to address health inequalities.\nSpecifying the expertise needed in themultidisciplinary assessment of patients undergoing bariatric surgery, and what this assessment includes,will help to reduce variation inpractice across the country, ensure people who are suitable have access to bariatric surgery at the right time, and provide a model for the expertise a specialist weight management service should have access to. Although increased referral numbers to bariatric surgery may create extra initial costs with respect to the number of people undergoing bariatric surgery, we anticipate these will be outweighed by a reduction in long term obesity and the service costs for obesity related comorbidities."

A guideline committee (GC) was established by the Guideline Development Team, which incorporated the following expertise: academics with interest in weight management, diabetes consultants, surgeons, a general practitioner, consultant psychiatrist, psychologist, dietician, health visitor, public health practitioner, and three lay members. The guideline is available at https://www.nice.org.uk/guidance/cg189. The guideline committee identified relevant review questions and collected and appraised clinical and cost effectiveness evidence. Quality ratings of the evidence were based on GRADE methodology (www.gradeworkinggroup.org). These relate to the quality of the available evidence for assessed outcomes or themes rather than the quality of the study. The GC agreed recommendations for clinical practice based on the available evidence or, when evidence was not found, based on their experience and opinion using informal consensus methods. The draft of the guideline went through a rigorous reviewing process, in which stakeholder organisations were invited to comment; the GC took all comments into consideration when producing the final version of the guideline. NICE will conduct regular reviews after publication of the guidance, to determine whether the evidence base has progressed significantly enough to alter the current guideline recommendations and require an update.\nContributors: All authors contributed to the development of the guideline and to the planning, drafting, and revision of this summary, approved the final version, and take responsibility for its accuracy.
