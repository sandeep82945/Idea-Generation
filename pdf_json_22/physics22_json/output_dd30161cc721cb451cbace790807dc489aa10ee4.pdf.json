Over centuries, cultures worldwide have evolved diverse cooking practices ingrained in their culinary traditions. Recipes, thus, are cultural capsules that capture culinary knowledge in elaborate cooking protocols3. While simple quantitative models have probed the patterns in recipe composition4\u20137 and the process of cuisine evolution8\u2013 10, unlike other cultural quirks such as language11,12, the principles of cooking remain hitherto unexplored. The fundamental rules that drive the act of cooking, shaping recipe composition and cuisine architecture, are unclear. Here we present a generative grammar of cooking that captures the underlying culinary logic. By studying an extensive repository of structured recipes3, we identify core concepts and rules that together forge a combinatorial system for culinary synthesis. Building on the body of work done in the context of language11,12, the demonstration of a logically consistent generative framework offers profound insights into the act of cooking. Given the central role of food in nutrition and lifestyle disorders, culinary grammar provides leverage to improve public health through dietary interventions beyond applications for creative pursuits such as novel recipe generation13,14.\nCooking is a creative act of turning nature into culture2,3. Starting with naturally available ingredients, the process of cooking transforms them into products that appeal to our sensory mechanisms and are a source of nourishment. This penchant for blending elements and processing them has led to the advent of the omnivorous human diet. Cultures around the world have evolved idiosyncrasies reflected in their culinary signatures\u2014the use of unique ingredients and ways of processing and combining them. Notwithstanding the stylistic differences, the underlying process of cooking is quite similar across cultures. It is natural to compare cooking with language, another human quirk and cultural phenomenon with no equivalent in the animal kingdom. One exciting question that is hitherto unexplored is, \u201cIs there a structure underlying the creative act of cooking?\u201d One needs to investigate the corpus of prevailing cooking practices to answer this question.\nDocumenting recipes. Historically, civilizations have passed cooking instructions through generations by oral means. These would typically include an assortment of ingredients and a step-by-step protocol for processing. While recipes have been documented for a long time, the invention of printing in the 15th century provided the much-needed impetus for cataloging cooking practices. Cookbooks, however, became mainstream only a few centuries down the\nline. The credit for introducing the concept of standardized measuring, going beyond the qualitative description of cooking, is given to Fannie Farmer, the author of \u201cThe Boston Cooking-School Cook Book15.\u201d The advent of the internet democratized recipe compilation, stimulating the growth of online recipe sources. While human-readable these recipes aren\u2019t computable (Figure 1a). It is impossible to explore their underlying structure without the knowledge of different \u2018named entities\u2019 that appear in the recipe text. Natural language processing algorithms enable automated tagging of crucial culinary elements\u2014ingredient name, quantity, unit, form (chopped, sliced, etc.), cooking action (roast, boil, saut\u00e9, etc.), and utensil, among others16. RecipeDB3 is a structured compilation of over 118,000 recipes from cuisines across the globe (6 continents, 26 geo-cultural regions, and 74 countries), cooked using 268 processes (heat, cook, boil, simmer, bake, etc.) by blending over 23,500 ingredients from diverse categories. Such a repository, well-annotated for culinary terminologies with named entity recognition algorithms16, captures contemporary cooking practices across cultures and provides a way to investigate fundamental cooking mechanisms.\nStructure and evolution of cuisines. In an effort to understand how cuisines evolve, some of the early computational studies8\u201310 took a simplistic view of recipes. By modeling the recipe as an unordered list of ingredients devoid of nuances of cooking, they proposed a copy-mutate model reminiscent of genetic mechanisms. Other studies4,5,7 included an additional layer of\ndetail\u2014the flavor of ingredients17 that serves as the basis for triggering olfactory and gustatory responses\u2014to explore the hidden patterns in ingredient pairing. These studies revealed characteristic \u2018culinary fingerprints6\u2019 and a cuisine-specific bias in ingredient pairing rooted in their flavor profiles. While such data-driven investigations capture the plausible means by which recipe repertoire grows over time and the basis for the selection of ingredient combinations rooted in their flavor, they ignore crucial culinary factors\u2014the quantity of ingredients, temporal flow, and processing actions\u2014that play a major role in the preparation of a dish.\nCuisine as a language. A story is to language what a recipe is to cuisine. Analogously, a word is for a sentence what an ingredient is for a statement of a recipe. The distribution of sentence sizes18 and recipe sizes4,5,7 share uncanny similarities. And the same is true for the popularity distribution of words19 and ingredients4,5,7. Given that cuisines and languages share broad statistical features, it is tempting to drive this analogy further. A generative grammar framework of language11,12,20 suggests that words, the basic building blocks of language, are combined following certain rules to yield sentences. The origin of this idea goes back to Panini21, a fifth-century BC Sanskrit grammarian. Such grammar is a combinatorial system in which a small inventory of concepts can be assembled by rules into an immense set of distinct sentences12. Perhaps basic building blocks of cooking, similar to words and rules of a\nlanguage11,12,20, are \u2018culinary concepts\u2019 that are put together to create \u2018culinary sentences.\u2019 Subsequently, these \u2018sentences\u2019 coalesce to form richer structures\u2014recipes. Let\u2019s name these \u2018culinary concepts\u2019 as \u2018cubits\u2019 (culinary bits)\u2014the culinary equivalent of an informationtheoretic bit (Figure 1b) (See Supplementary Information for a list of cubits). We suggest that analogous to words that relate to parts of speech, cubits are parts of cooking. We propose the following cubits: ingredient name (I), quantity-and-unit (Q), form (F), processing action (P), description of processing action (T), and utensil (U). While some of these are comparable to their linguistic counterparts (noun, determiner, adjective, verb), the others are not.\nCulinary grammar. The grammar of cooking comprises a set of rules governing the flavor (a sensory experience), the lexicon of cubits, their morphology, syntax (patterns of arrangement of cubits), and semantics of cooking (Figure 2). Nature dictates the composition of an ingredient\u2019s flavor molecules, specifying its taste and smell. Further, led by the cultural practices, processing actions (P), in conjunction with cubits quantity (Q), form (F), and the way of processing (T), help alter the sensory experience of an ingredient. The culinary lexicon is a metaphorical kitchen shelf of cubits (I, P, U, Q, F, T) shaped by the forces of culture, climate, geography, religion, and history. The cubit morphology refers to the mechanisms that shape the cubits. Every ingredient has norms about its typical quantum in a culinary sentence other than its varieties and forms. The chilly is often \u2018cut\u2019 and used in much lesser quantity than a potato, for example.\nThe syntax presents a set of rules with which cubits combine to produce culinary phrases, which in turn are fused to yield a culinary sentence (Figure 1c). The first rule generates \u2018ingredient phrases\u2019 such as those listed in a recipe\u2019s \u2018ingredients\u2019 section (Figure 1a). An ingredient phrase (IP) may be composed of the cubits quantity-and-unit (Q), form (F), and the name of the ingredient (I). The second rule refers to the \u2018processing actions (P)\u2019 that produce chemical transformations in ingredients (I), profoundly changing flavor profiles. A processing phrase (PP) may consist of a process (P) cubit followed by its direct object(s), one or many ingredient phrases. Finally, the third rule yields gastronomically meaningful \u2018sentences.\u2019 A sentence in \u2018recipe instructions\u2019 may be composed of a processing phrase (PP) and a utensil (U) cubit. These rules, analogous to their linguistic parallels12, are productive, abstract, and combinatorial. By assembling culinary concepts into phrases (according to the parts of cooking terms), this view of culinary structure gives an insight into the use and understanding of cooking. The proposed grammar materially simplifies cooking by introducing a \u2018culinary phrase structure\u2019 description.\nAccordingly, following the first rule, an ingredient phrase such as \u201c100 gm of sliced potatoes\u201d could yield a simple processing phrase such as \u201cBoil the sliced potatoes,\u201d indicating a culinary transformation (Figure 3a). Finally, these culinary phrases could lead to a meaningful sentence\u2014\u201cBoil the sliced potatoes in a pot.\u201d We are aware that, in this simple form, the grammar assumes the presence of determiners (the, a) and prepositions (in). The beauty of such a structure lies in its ability to introduce the magic of recursion12,22, which is at the heart of complex dynamical systems. Replacing an ingredient phrase with a sentence (Figure 3b) invokes this magic. Such recursive culinary grammar can express an unlimited number of distinct recipe steps, limited in practice only by stamina, money, and time. See Figure 4 for a nuanced version of the grammar to include details of ingredients (quantity-and-unit and form) and processing (descriptors such as thoroughly, slowly, for 10 minutes, etc.). Figure S1 (Supplementary Information) presents a nested tree depicting the process of preparing an \u201cItalian Potato Salad.\u201d\nCombinatorial system for recipe generation. Culinary grammar is a combinatorial system in which a small inventory of concepts can be assembled by rules into an immense set of distinct recipe sentences. Given the large variety in existing cubits (18,599 ingredient names, 71 quantity terms, 1299 forms, 270 processing actions, over 100 descriptors of processing actions, and 69 utensils), the number of ingredient and processing phrases and, subsequently, the number of such sentences is astronomical (See Supplementary Information for a list of cubits). Starting with such a kernel of gastronomic sentences, the number of generated recipes and hence the size of the cuisine can be unimaginably large. The beauty of such a combinatorial system is that it generates combinations that have never existed before in the culinary repository but that one might want to create someday. Thus, the creativity inherent in the act of cooking can be explained by a grammar of combinatorial rules through the infinite use of finite media12.\nRoasted meat, what a tasty feat. Cooking grows, by blending cubits.\nThe cooking machine. By employing generative techniques, natural and cultural systems leverage the power of combinatorial mechanisms. The salient examples are DNA and protein sequences23,24, language11,12,20, and music25,26. A generative apparatus for creating variations, along with a selection layer for filtering out unfit variants reminiscent of Darwinian thought, seems to be the essence of dynamical, living systems. Having established a generative grammar for cooking, similar to the Turing\u2019s question27, one of the most exciting thoughts is, \u201cCan machines cook?\u201d Deep-learning models can generate recipes with a decent novelty score13,14 when trained on a large, annotated corpus of recipes (https://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in/ratatouille2). However, this approach relies on a statistical model devoid of insights into the anatomy of cooking. A generative cooking model would be of immense value for creating grammatical culinary phrases, sentences, and recipes, which can further be sifted for compliance with the\nculinary fingerprints6. Appropriate filtering strategies can help generate recipes that comply with dietary style, nutritional requirements, and inclusion or exclusions of certain ingredients to account for personal choices or the carbon footprint of recipes28. The generative framework of cooking has far-reaching consequences for \u2018computational gastronomy\u201929 endeavors for achieving better public health and sustainability. Searching for palatable, tasty, nutritional, healthy, and sustainable recipes from a galaxy of \u2018grammatically generated recipes\u2019 has the power to transform the landscape of food. To quote Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin, the author of \u2018The Physiology of Taste\u201930 and someone credited for coining the term \u2018gastronomy,\u2019 \u201cThe discovery of a new dish confers more happiness on humanity than the discovery of a new star.\u201d\nAcknowledgments. The author thanks the Indraprastha Institute of Information Technology Delhi (IIIT-Delhi) for facilitating divergent cross-disciplinary thinking. Special thanks to the Department of Computational Biology and Infosys Center for Artificial Intelligence, which enabled the author to blend ideas from cooking, linguistics, biology, and information sciences to arrive at the generative framework. Putting together the computational gastronomy edifice (https://cosylab.iiitd.edu.in) would not have been possible for the author without prodigious efforts from his students, many of whom were undergraduates. Teaching the \u2018Computational Gastronomy\u2019 course to a computing-intense audience has been critical for the synthesis of key ideas. The author could not have reached this juncture without the stint at the Indian Institute of Technology Jodhpur (IIT Jodhpur), which was a tipping point in his intellectual journey."
