    "abstractText": "The authenticity of food products marketed as health-promoting foods\u2014especially unrefined, cold-pressed seed oils\u2014should be controlled to ensure their quality and safeguard consumers and patients. Metabolomic profiling using liquid chromatography coupled to quadrupole time-offlight mass spectrometry (LC\u2013QTOF) was employed to identify authenticity markers for five types of unrefined, cold-pressed seed oils: black seed oil (Nigella sativa L.), pumpkin seed oil (Cucurbita pepo L.), evening primrose oil (Oenothera biennis L.), hemp oil (Cannabis sativa L.) and milk thistle oil (Silybum marianum). Of the 36 oil-specific markers detected, 10 were established for black seed oil, 8 for evening primrose seed oil, 7 for hemp seed oil, 4 for milk thistle seed oil and 7 for pumpkin seed oil. In addition, the influence of matrix variability on the oil-specific metabolic markers was examined by studying binary oil mixtures containing varying volume percentages of each tested oil and each of three potential adulterants: sunflower, rapeseed and sesame oil. The presence of oil-specific markers was confirmed in 7 commercial oil mix products. The identified 36 oil-specific metabolic markers proved useful for confirming the authenticity of the five target seed oils. The ability to detect adulterations of these oils with sunflower, rapeseed and sesame oil was demonstrated.",

            "text": "Lifestyle changes, such as medications, should be tailored to the individual. Lifestyle changes are based on four main pillars: nutrition, sleep, physical activity and stress management. The National Sleep Foundation recommends that an adult get from 7 to 9 h of sleep each night, whereas school-age children should get between 9 and 11 h. The quality of sleep can be improved by making use of the natural circadian rhythm. Furthermore, blue light emitted from the screens of electronic devices should be avoided before bedtime. Physical activity significantly reduces the risk of heart disease, enhances brain function and helps improve mood. Stress management focuses on reducing stress through socializing, spending time outdoors or taking hot, relaxing baths [1]. Nutrition, one of the most important pillars, should focus consistently on consuming healthy foods that provide adequate but not excessive calories. This helps to avoid becoming overweight or underweight and provides the body with the necessary minerals and vitamins [2]. Accordingly, highly processed foods should be avoided, sugar intake reduced, fruit and vegetable consumption increased and fiber-rich products, and those supporting a proper gut microbiome, should be central to the diet [1]. The education of consumers regarding these subjects would benefit from promoting traditional, regional food products grown on organic farms and learning from traditional medicine [2].\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4754. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28124754 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4754 2 of 18\nSeed oils have been used since antiquity not only as food but also as the first pharmaceuticals and cosmetics [3]. Seed oils are an important part of the diet because they contain fatty acids, including unsaturated fatty acids, such as omega-3 (\u03b1-linolenic acid) and omega-6 (linoleic acid) fatty acids, which are not synthesized by the human body and must thus be supplied by the daily diet. Fatty acids are necessary for the transmission of nerve impulses, the synthesis of hemoglobin and for cell division [4]. Seed oils are also rich in significant phytochemicals, such as phenolic compounds, sterols, carotenoids, minerals and vitamins, making these oils useful in the treatment of various diseases. Black seed oil (Nigella sativa L.) is used to treat type 2 diabetes [5,6], and evening primrose oil (Oenothera biennis L.) is used to treat mastalgia [7] and polycystic ovary syndrome [8]. Pumpkin seed oil (Cucurbitapepo L.) is used to treat overactive bladder [9] and chronic nonbacterial prostatitis [10]. Milk thistle oil (Silybum marianum) aids in the treatment of hepatic steatosis [11], and hemp oil (Cannabis sativa L.) helps treat atopic dermatitis [12]. However, seed oils used for these purposes must be produced from high-quality seeds and pressed using techniques that provide oil products that promote health and meet consumers\u2019 expectations in terms of both quality and taste. In an effort to provide consumers with the highest quality products, analytical methods have been developed to assess the purity of a product, confirm its authenticity or detect adulteration [13]. The adulteration of seed oils is not a challenge for producers, as adulterated and authentic products generally have the same consistency and similar colors, and oils are typically stored in dark bottles to protect them from sunlight. Several analytical methods have been developed to detect the adulteration of seed oils using specialized equipment and expert knowledge. For example, high-resolution mass spectrometry was used by Kotecka-Majchrzak et al. [14] to detect new species-specific peptide markers for 10 cold-pressed seed oils. Wei et al. [15] identified triacylglycerols (TAGs), which might provide a quick method for screening for oil adulteration using ion mobility spectroscopy [16] and total synchronous fluorescence spectroscopy (TSyF) [17]. Untargeted metabolomics coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry allowed fingerprinting analysis and the identification of specific markers for detecting the adulteration of sesame oil [18]. Metabolomics has been applied in food research to assess food safety, food composition and food adulteration. The application of metabolomic analysis techniques was summarized by Wu et al. [19]. Furthermore, the use of LC-MS along with metabolic studies has contributed to the development of an analytical method to detect adulteration of cameline oil with soybean, peanut and canola oils. Additionally, metabolic studies were carried out to detect adulteration of olive oil with hazelnut oil. It is recommended that in order to confirm the authenticity of the oils or to detect their adulteration using metabolomic together with mass spectrometry larger number of markers is required since their occurrence or intensity may depend on the geographic conditions in which crops are grown [20,21]. In this work, we applied an untargeted approach combining chemometrics and highperformance liquid chromatography coupled with a quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer (LC\u2013QTOF) to detect and identify new oil-specific metabolic markers for five plant oils: black seed oil (Nigella sativa L.), pumpkin seed oil (Cucurbita pepo L.), evening primrose oil (Oenothera biennis L.), hemp oil (Cannabis sativa L.) and milk thistle oil (Silybum marianum). To study the effects of matrix variability on the stability, sensitivity and selectivity of the newly identified metabolic markers, binary oil mixtures of the oils analyzed in this study were prepared with three different oil matrices: sunflower oil (SO), rapeseed oil (RO) and sesame oil (SeO). The effect was evaluated by studying the linearity of the MS signals for oil-specific markers and the limits of detection for each marker were estimated."

This approach provided information on known and unknown metabolites found in the analyzed oils. To\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4754 3 of 18\nselect the markers that are characteristic of a given plant species, oils from nine species of plants (black seed, evening primrose, hemp, milk thistle, pumpkin seed, sunflower, rapeseed, flax and sesame oils) were used. We procured eight samples from four different producers for each species. The metabolomic marker finally selected as the oil-specific marker had to meet four requirements: be present in all eight samples of oil prepared from the same species, be absent in the remaining 64 samples of oils, be absent in the organic solvent used in sample extraction and be of high intensity. The list of selected oil-specific candidate compounds obtained during MPP filtering was verified manually to confirm their presence in the raw MS data across all oil samples of the given species using MassHunter Qualitative Analysis B.10.00 software (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA). Of the 229 compounds from black seed oil, 10 met all four of the above criteria, and the highest intensity ions were at m/z 404.2641 (M8) and m/z 385.2376 (M7) (Figure 1). For evening primrose oil, 207 compounds were initially obtained, 8 of which were identified as evening primrose oil-specific markers with the highest intensities for the ions at m/z 720.4547 (M5) and m/z 429.3741 (M7) (Figure 1). Of the 87 compounds from hemp oil, 7 markers were ultimately confirmed as hemp oil-specific, of which the most intense were the ions at m/z 341.2123 (M4) and m/z 375.2178 (M1) (Figure 1). Milk thistle oil analyses initially showed 295 compounds, but only 4 met the milk thistle oil-specific criteria, with the highest intensities for the ions at m/z 233.1545 (M3) and m/z 239.2013 (M4) (Figure 1). Of 274 compounds from pumpkin seed oil, we ultimately determined 7 as pumpkin seed oil-specific markers, of which the ions at m/z 578.4219 (M4) and m/z 682.4482 (M7) were the most intense (Figure 1). All 36 identified oil-specific metabolomic markers were then fragmented using targeted MS/MS QTOF analysis mode. The product spectra were acquired at collision energies in the range from 10 to 40 eV.

            "text": "The acquired MS/MS spectra of 36 oil-specific metabolomic markers were searched against MassHunter METLIN Metabolite Personal Compound Database and Library (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). METLIN is a database created in 2003 for tandem mass spectrometry and enables the identification of metabolites. The database stores data acquired in positive and negative ionization modes and multiple collision energy data from high resolution spectra. The METLIN database contains molecular standards, including metabolites, drugs and toxins [22]. The assignment of oil-specific metabolomic marker candidates to the measured signal was conducted by comparing the experimental spectra with the MS/MS spectrum available in the METLIN PCDL. A positive match was based on the MS accurate mass (mass error < 1 ppm, isotopic distribution score > 95%) and MS/MS spectral match (matching score > 95%) (Figure 2). We assigned two compounds. One is cannabidiol (CBD; C21H30O2), the compound with characteristic C21 terpeno-phenolic backbone present in plants from the Cannabaceae family and in hemp oil [23]. This compound is considered to be a potential drug as a palliative treatment or for combination therapy for cancer patients [24]. Citti et al. [25] identified CBD in 13 commercially available hemp oils at concentrations between 2.575 and 233.8 mg/kg. The second oil-specific marker candidate identified in the METLIN PCDL is silibinin (C25H22O10). This compound is a polyphenolic flavonoid antioxidant that makes up 50\u201360% of the silymarin complex. Silibinin has antioxidant properties and modulates insulin resistance [26]. These metabolites are commonly found in milk thistle oil (silibinin) and hemp oil (cannabidiol), and thus, they can be used as specific markers to confirm the authenticity of thistle oil and hemp oil. The measured MS/MS spectra of a cannabidiol candidate in hemp oil and a silibinin candidate in milk thistle oil were identical to the MS/MS spectra of cannabidiol and silibinin available in the METLIN PCDL, and the isotope distributions of the two are shown in Figure 2a,b, respectively.

For the remaining selected characteristic ions, for which we did not find a match in the METLIN PCDL, the formulas were generated using the compound algorithm in Agilent Mass Hunter Qualitative Analysis B.10.00 software (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, California, USA). The following parameters were applied: positive H+ ion with elements that may appear in formulas, including C, H, O, N, S and Cl; peak sparing tolerance 0.0025 m/z; mass differences 5 ppm; and the matching scores > 95%. The assigned formulas are reported in Table 1. Schymanski et al. [27] conducted a literature review and proposed a 5 level system of small molecule identification by liquid chromatography\u2014high resolution mass spectrometry (LC\u2013HRMS). Level 1\u2014confirmed structure: confirmation of the compound using the reference standard, from the MS, MS/MS level and retention time. Level 2\u2014probable: identification of the compound by matching information from the literature or library spectral data. Level 3\u2014tentative candidate: assumptions are required to confirm the structure, so there is no definitive confirmation. Level 4\u2014unequivocal molecule: generates a pattern using the interpretation of observed m/z, adducts, isotope patterns and fragment information. Level 5\u2014exact mass: a compound referred to as \u201cunknown\u201d; observed m/z and MS/MS fragments are the only known information. Thirty-six specific markers were selected as authenticity markers for five types of unrefined, cold-pressed seed oils. Two were identified at level 2 according to the classification proposed by Schymanski et al. [27]: silibinin in milk thistle oil and cannabidiol in hemp oil. A further 31 markers were identified at level 4, and 3 at level 5 (Table 1). A similar interpretation of the results was made by Cavanna et al. [28], who used LC\u2013HRMS to select metabolic markers to detect soft-refined oil additives to extra virgin olive oils. They identified 12 molecules, 2 of which were identified at level 2, 6 at level 3 and 4 at level 4. Cao et al. [29] used an untargeted and pseudotargeted approach to indicate potential markers differentiating live pigs from pork meat and detected 24 metabolite markers. The identification of markers was carried out using the METLIN database and reference standards. They identified two markers with reference standards, for next six markers they found match in the database. For other six markers, they predicted formulas with mass error < 5 ppm (level 4). The remaining seven of the 24 markers were marked at level 5. Moreover, Garcia et al. [30] also used the LC\u2013MS untargeted metabolomic approach to predict the browning of fresh-cut lettuce, which significantly decreases the quality of the vegetable. They used statistical software, allowing the selection of a group of metabolites. Several of the selected metabolites were confirmed using reference standards. Unknown metabolites, identified at levels 4 and 5, were also reported."

            "text": "To study the effects of matrix variability on the stability, sensitivity and selectivity of 36 oil-specific metabolomic markers, binary mixtures of the 5 oils analyzed in this study and 3 different oil matrices (SO, RO and SeO) were prepared. These oils were chosen for the two-component mixtures because they are several times cheaper than the oils tested. Sunflower and rapeseed oils are often identified as cheap additives, as they lower the final cost of production [31]. The correlation between the peak area of the 36 oil-specific metabolomic markers and the percentage concentration of the five oils selected in this study was evaluated in the range of 5\u201390% (v/v). Of the ten metabolomic markers for black seed oil, seven showed acceptable linearity (R2 > 0.95) measured in all tested oil matrices; for evening primrose oil, all eight markers met the set requirements. Of the seven metabolomic markers selected for hemp oil, only one marker (m/z 375.2178 (M1)) was found with an R2 value over 0.95 in all tested oil matrices, whereas three markers (m/z 369.1343 (M2), m/z 437.1965 (M3), m/z 341.2123 (M4)) met these requirements in mixtures with SO and RO. Of the four metabolomic markers\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4754 7 of 18\nselected for milk thistle oil, three (m/z 483.1296 (M2), m/z 233.1545(M3), m/z 239.2013 (M4)) showed adequate R2 values for all tested oil matrices. All metabolomic markers for pumpkin seed oil showed good linearity, with R2 coefficients exceeding 0.95. The findings indicate that that the change of sample composition resulting from adding adulterant oil does not negatively affect marker selectivity and detectability, and thus their utility. In the next step, we calculated the LOD for the metabolomic markers that met the requirement of R2 > 0.95. Of the selected markers for black seed oil, five were characterized by very low detection limits and low signal variability and are supremely good candidates for routine oil authentication. The ranges of LOD values were as follows: 0.06\u20130.16% [v/v] (M8, m/z = 404.2641); 0.07\u20130.29% [v/v] (M7, m/z = 385.2376); 0.58\u20130.84% [v/v] (M4, m/z = 313.1802); 0.29\u20130.38% [v/v] (M5, m/z = 238.0901); and 0.94\u20131.53% [v/v] (M1, m/z = 166.1226), respectively. Given that the diversity and complexity of the matrix of the analyzed sample may affect the intensity or attenuation of the signal of the analyzed ion, the calculated LOD values also demonstrate the stability and sensitivity of the characteristic markers in relation to changing the matrix of the analyzed sample. All eight metabolomic ion markers for evening primrose oil met the requirements for R2. The lowest LOD values were for marker M4, m/z = 492.3174, in the range of 0.13\u20130.21% [v/v] and the highest LOD values were for marker M7, m/z = 577.3900, in the range of 3.83\u20134.19% [v/v]. Of the markers selected for hemp oil, only marker M1, m/z = 375.2178, with an LOD of 0.2\u20130.33% [v/v] had R2 > 0.95. For cannabidiol (M5, m/z = 315.2319), the values of LOD were not calculated because the R2 coefficients did not exceed 0.95. Of the markers selected for milk thistle oil, three met the requirements for R2. The LOD values for these markers were in the following ranges: 0.24\u20130.8% [v/v] (M3, m/z = 233.1545); 0.31\u20130.7% (M4, m/z = 239.2013); and 2.11\u20132.22% [v/v] (M2, m/z = 483.1286, silibinin), respectively. Rahal et al. [32] determined the content of silibinin in milk thistle oil using supercritical carbon dioxide to be in the range of 51.1 \u00b1 1.3 to 140.24 \u00b1 4.99 \u00b5g/mL; however, they did not determine the LOD value. All metabolomic markers for pumpkin seed oil (M1\u2013M7) had R2 values of > 0.95. The LOD range for the highest intensity marker (M4, m/z = 578.4219) was 0.03\u20130.12%. All LOD results are presented in Table 2. The obtained LOD results enabled us to detect the presence of individual oils in products, even if their content was < 5%. This is extremely important in economic terms, as the oils analyzed in this study are often used as ingredients in cosmetics in low concentrations owing to their high price. In addition, the LOD calculations for two-component mixtures for five studied oils showed that most of the ions, for which these values were calculated, are stable, regardless of the matrix of the analyzed sample.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4754 8 of 18\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4754 9 of 18\nSO\u2014sunflower oil; RO\u2014rapeseed oil; SeO\u2014sesame oil; asterix (*)\u2014the value was not calculated.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4754 10 of 18"

For black seed oil, marker M1 (m/z 166.1226) showed the smallest difference in intensity, with an RSD of 36.48%, whereas the highest was for the marker M8, m/z 404.2641, where the value was 128.73%. The RSD for hemp oil was in the range of 46\u201365.6%. For milk thistle oil, all markers showed an RSD above 60%. For evening primrose oil, the four markers analyzed did not exceed an RSD of 31%, although the highest value was observed for the M6 marker (m/z 720.4547, 92%). Of the seven markers for pumpkin seed oil, the lowest variability was observed for marker M4, m/z 578.4219 (14.72%), and the highest was for M5, m/z 697.4592, at 66.8%. The RSD values for the other markers are shown in Table S2 in the Supplementary Materials. Despite the different intensities of the markers selected from five types of seed oils, these markers can be effectively used in the qualitative analyses for oils authentication and adulteration testing. Their utility for quantitative analyses seems to be limited, as the uncertainty of the determination would be high."

The LOD values calculated for sesame oil were 0.12\u20131.52% [v/v] and 0.11\u20133.03% [v/v] for markers m/z 371.1136 and m/z 173.0604, respectively. Markers for sunflower oil with good sensitivity potential include these of m/z 203.1076 and m/z 392.2444, with LOD values of 0.4\u20133.3% and [v/v] and 0.42\u20132.83% [v/v], respectively (Table S3).

            "text": "In the next step of our study, we used selected metabolic markers to confirm the authenticity of commercial, unrefined, cold-pressed oil blends of two, three and four components. The purchased oils differed in both composition and proportions which, according to the manufacturer\u2019s declaration, were specifically selected for particular target groups. The following blends were subject to analysis: oil for children (Mix1), oil for the heart (Mix 2), oil for women (Mix 3), oil for mothers (Mix 4), oil for elderly (Mix 5), oil for men (Mix 6) and immune oil (Mix 7). The composition of the products is listed in Table S4 in Supplementary Materials. We verified plant species compliance with oil labeling information by monitoring 36 species-specific markers identified in this study. The list was extended by 13 species-specific markers for sunflower oil and 3 species-specific flax seed oil markers from our previous study [33]. The results of the composition verification of 7 blends subject to analysis was presented in Table 3. The intensity of detected markers was shown on chromatograms in Figure S1 in Supplementary Materials. The presence of all 10 specific markers was confirmed for black seed oil, which was a component of Mix 1 (2%), Mix 7 (4%) and Mix 2 (20%). Evening primrose oil was the component of Mix 3 (3%), Mix 7 (5%) and Mix 4 (20%). Seven of eight metabolite markers for this oil were present in Mix 4, six of eight were detected in Mix 7, but only markers M1 (m/z 469.3317) and M7 (m/z 577.39) were found in the product with 3% contents of evening primrose oil. In the oil for men (Mix 6) we detected four of seven species-specific markers for hemp oil. The highest intensity was observed for M1 (m/z 375.2178) and M4 (m/z 341.2123). The presence of milk thistle oil in Mix 3 (27%) and Mix 5 (20%) was confirmed with all specific markers for the species. Pumpkin seed oil was in the composition of Mix 6 (10%) and Mix 7 (4%). In Mix 6, we detected six of 7 specific markers and in Mix 7 we found five of them. In both products, the M7 marker (m/z 578.5152) was not found. All 13 and 3 metabolites were detected in Mix 4 for sunflower oil and flaxseed oil, respectively. Moreover, all three markers for flaxseed oil were present in Mix 1, Mix 2, Mix 3, Mix 5 and Mix 6. The detection of the markers allowed the qualitative determination of the composition of commercially available oil blends and the confirmation of their authenticity. The markers that have been identified can be successfully used in screening, which, thanks to rapid analysis, allows the qualitative confirmation of the composition of the oil and oil blends where doubts may be raised as to their authenticity.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4754 13 of 18\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4754 14 of 18"

            "text": "An untargeted metabolomic approach using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry was used to discover oil-specific metabolomic markers for five types of unrefined, cold-pressed seed oils. We identified a set of 36 metabolic markers: 10 for black seed oil, 8 for evening primrose oil, 7 for pumpkin seed oil, 4 for milk thistle oil and 7 for hemp oil which can be applied to the authentication of oils. The analytical method allowing detection of oil-specific markers is efficient, easy and fast. It requires only a simple liquid\u2013liquid extraction process for sample preparation and a 30 min analytical run. Small quantities of chemicals are needed, the workload and costs of analysis are low. Simultaneously, in the same chromatographic run, the adulterations with other oils may be detected by monitoring markers of potential adulterant oils. Multiple reaction monitoring methods can also be developed for identified markers, thus further increasing the facility of method implementations in food control laboratories for routine verification of the composition of cold-pressed seed oils and rapid screening for oil adulterations.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www. mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28124754/s1, Figure S1.
