However, the reported probes for monitoring Hg2+ still have some shortcomings, such as poor selectivity and water solubility and high detection limits (LODs).31\u201335 Therefore, new uorescent probes need to be developed for monitoring Hg2+ in the environment with excellent selectivity and sensitivity and good water solubility.\nAccordingly, herein, we synthesized the TPH probe, which was based on the TPC-OH dye as the uorophore36 and phenyl thiochloroformate as the recognition receptor of Hg2+.37,38 Phenyl thiochloroformate possesses high selectivity for the detection of Hg2+, and thus the TPH probe could also achieve the specic and sensitive detection of Hg2+. The TPH probe exhibited the following excellent properties: (1) good water solubility, (2) excellent sensitivity (LOD = 16 nM), (3) high selectivity, and (4) excellent application in the environment. Thus, this probe will have a wide application prospect for monitoring Hg2+ in the environment."
