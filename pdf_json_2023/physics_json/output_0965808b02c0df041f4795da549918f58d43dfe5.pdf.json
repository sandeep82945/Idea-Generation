    "abstractText": "Substituent-regulated cyclization of conjugated alkynes with acid catalysis was developed in this paper, and it provides a straightforward synthesis of cyclic-(E)-[3]dendralenes. Depending on the electronic effect of the aromatic ring pairing, a variety of phosphinyl quintuplet/hexa cyclo[3]dendralenes with diverse substitution patterns are accessible, with good efficiency and high stereoselectivity. This self-cyclization process achieves the first precise construction of a phosphinylcyclo(E)-[3]dendralene from conjugated alkynes to aromatization.",

            "text": "Dendralenes, commonly known as cross-conjugated oligoalkenes, are an important class of oligo-olefinic hydrocarbon structures, exclusively comprising sp2-hybridized carbons [1]. Until the turn of the century, dendralenes had received little attention, most likely due to the erroneous assumption that they were too unstable to be handled in the laboratory using standard equipment and methods [2,3]. These formations were difficult to synthesize for a long time and were believed to be unstable entities from their discovery in 1955, which limited further research. A noticeable breakthrough in the practical synthesis of dendranlenes was reported by Sherburn and co-workers in 2009, finding that dendralenes are actually stable and also have surprising reactivities [4]. Subsequently, dendralenes attracted increased interest because of their unusual structure and electronic phenomenon, with widespread applications of dendralenes in polymer chemistry [5,6], theoretical chemistry [7\u201310], materials chemistry [11,12], electrochemistry [13], and synthetic chemistry [14\u201326], among which, cyclo-[3]dendralene, as the primary member of the family, has attracted the greatest attention owing to its wide existence in naturally occurring products and engagement in synthetic compounds [27]. For linear dendralenes, the physical and chemical properties of the annulenes are dominated by this parity-dependent behavior. Alternation of melting points in families of compounds with even- and odd-length chains has also been reported, and this is related to the property of the packing of molecules in crystal lattices. In these systems, an alternation in behavior does not extend to any other physical or chemical property [28]. Notably, when all double bonds in a dendralene molecule are in the same plane, the endo-type dendralenes will produce significant site resistance. Single bonds will then be rotated to reduce the site resistance, making the molecule resemble a \u201cpropeller\u201d shape. However, cyclic-dendralenes limit the rotation of the single bond, which will affect the arrangement of the double bond and the chemical properties of the molecule [28]. Although cyclic-(E)-[3]dendralenes are also important skeletons in natural products, as shown in Scheme 1 [29,30], only a handful of cases have been devoted to synthesizing these stereo-structures, sometimes with unsatisfied stereoselectivity.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4382. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28114382 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4382 2 of 10\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 11\ncases have been devoted to synthesizing these stereo-structures, sometimes with unsatisfied stereoselectivity.\nScheme 1.

Diphenylphosphine chloride (40 mmol) in CH2Cl2 (50 mL) was added dropwise to\na stirred and cooled (0 \u25e6C) solution of acetylenic alcohol (40 mmol) in anhydrous ether (50 mL) and pyridine (3.88 mL, 48 mmol) under nitrogen. The stirring was maintained 1 h at 0 \u25e6C and at room temperature overnight. The solution was then quenched with cold water and extracted with CH2Cl2, and the organic layer was dried with Na2SO4. Concentration in vacuo gave the crude product that was subjected to flash chromatography on silica gel eluting with ethyl acetate and petroleum ether. Note: The acetylenic alcohols were synthesized from terminal alkynes with corresponding ketones mediated by n-BuLi [36].\nGeneral Procedures for Substrate II Preparation [36]. To a 25 mL vial, allenylphosphine oxides (1 mmol), alkynes (2 mmol), potassium\ncarbonate (K2CO3) (2 mmol), DMSO (10 mL), and Pd-NPS (1 mol%, 16 mg) were added. The reaction was then allowed to react at 100 \u25e6C for a certain time until the complete consumption of starting materials monitored via TLC. The reaction mixture was extracted\nMolecules 2023, 28, 4382 6 of 10\nwith EtOAc (10 mL \u00d7 3). The combined organic extract was washed with brine and dried over anhydrous Na2SO4. The solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure, and the residue was purified using column chromatography on silica gel using petroleum ether/ethylacetate (1.5/1) as the eluent to afford the enynes. After this was finished, the compound was determined through NMR. Further, 1a\u20131n are known compounds; please refer to [37]. General Procedures for Substituents Regulate the Cyclization of Conjugated Alkynes Constructing Cyclo-(Z)-[3]Dendralenes. A 10 mL flask equipped with a magnetic stirrer was charged with conjugated alkynes (1a, 50 mg, 0.1 mmol), TFA (3.4 mg, 30 mol%), and 3 mL DCM. The reaction mixture was then heated to 50 \u25e6C for 3 h until the complete consumption of 1a monitored via TLC. Subsequently, all of the volatiles were removed under vacuum, and the crude product was purified on flash chromatography (eluent: 1:1 (v/v) of ethyl acetate/petroleum ether) to afford product 2a (45 mg, 90%) as a yellow solid.

This strategy features easily accessible substrates, operational simplicity, and expands the pool of cyclic-[3]dendralenes in organic synthesis.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28114382/s1.
