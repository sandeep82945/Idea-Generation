We longitudinally measured\nthe frequency-following response (FFR), a robust indicator of early sensory\nencoding along the auditory pathway, to a Mandarin lexical tone in 7-\nand 11-months-old monolingual English-learning infants. Infants received\neither no intervention (language-experience group) or music intervention\n(music-intervention group) randomly between FFR recordings. The language-\nexperience group exhibited the expected decline in FFR pitch-tracking\naccuracy to the Mandarin tone, while the music-intervention group did not.\nOur results support both hypotheses and demonstrate that both language and\nmusic experiences alter infants\u2019 speech encoding.\nKEYWORDS\nInfant speech learning, sensitive period, music intervention, speech encoding, frequency-following response (FFR), lexical tones\nIntroduction\nThe sensitive period for phonetic learning occurs between 6 and 12 months of age and constitutes one of the earliest milestones in language acquisition, as the learning outcomes of this period have been shown to be reliable predictors of individual differences in later speech and language skills (Tsao et al., 2004; Kuhl et al., 2005, 2008; Zhao et al., 2021).\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience 01 frontiersin.org\nThe main characteristic of the sensitive period is a \u201cperceptual narrowing\u201d phenomenon that occurs with increased native language experience. Specifically, infants\u2019 ability to process non-native speech contrasts starts to decline, while infants simultaneously become significantly better at processing phonetic differences in their native language (Werker and Tees, 1984; Kuhl et al., 2006). Previously, Werker and Tees (1984) demonstrated a significantly reduced ability in English-learning infants to discriminate non-native Hindi and Salish consonant contrasts at 12 months, compared to infants at 6 months of age, while these contrasts remained highly discriminable for Hindi and Salish learning infants. These effects of linguistic experience on speech discrimination for non-native phonetic contrasts during this period have since been observed in both behavioral as well as neural responses to many phonetic contrasts (Kuhl et al., 1992, 2006).\nNotably, this perceptual narrowing phenomenon has also been observed for lexical tones, which are linguistically relevant pitch patterns that contrast word meaning in more than half of the world\u2019s languages (Hyman, 2001). For example, Mandarin Chinese has four distinctive lexical tones: /yi/ in Tone 1 (highlevel pitch) means one, /yi/ in Tone 2 (low-rising pitch) means \u201caunt\u201d, /yi/ in Tone 3 (low-dipping pitch) means \u201cchair\u201d and /yi/ in Tone 4 (high-falling tone) means \u201c100 million.\u201d Studies demonstrate that lexical tones are already more difficult to discriminate by 9 months of age for non-tonal language learning infants (Mattock and Burnham, 2006; Mattock et al., 2008).\nA second characteristic of the sensitive period is the high malleability of its outcome, which has been demonstrated by interventions that provide infants with additional auditory experience (Kuhl et al., 2003; Zhao and Kuhl, 2017). In the seminal study, 9-month-old monolingual English-learning infants were randomly assigned to participate in 12 sessions of laboratory-controlled, live and highly interactive, exposure sessions with a foreign language speaker (Mandarin) vs. 12 sessions in English. After the intervention period, all infants were tested on their ability to discriminate a Mandarin contrast and only infants who completed the Mandarin sessions demonstrated ability to discriminate the speech contrast that was the same as Mandarin-learning infants (Kuhl et al., 2003). Critically, infants who completed Mandarin exposure sessions with only audio (i.e., listening to recordings) or audiovisual input (i.e., watching TV) did not demonstrate learning either, suggesting the crucial role of live interaction. This phenomenon has since been replicated with Spanish as well, with EEG measures characterizing neural sensitivity to speech contrasts (Conboy and Kuhl, 2011; Lytle et al., 2018). Taken together, intensive interactive foreign language interventions have been shown to reverse the decline in nonnative speech discrimination during the sensitive period.\nMore recently, a study further demonstrated that a similar intervention with music (i.e., 12 interactive sessions starting at 9 months of age), instead of foreign language, was also able to\nenhance infants\u2019 neural discrimination of a non-native speech contrast, in addition to enhancing neural processing of music rhythm (Zhao and Kuhl, 2016). This result was in line with a growing literature demonstrating a cross-domain generalization effect from early music training experience to speech processing, that is, an enhanced ability to process not only music, but also speech sounds, in adults and children who received significant music training early in life [e.g., (Pantev et al., 1998; Kraus et al., 2014)]. Critically, this study demonstrated such cross-domain generalization as early as in infancy. Together, these results support the hypotheses of shared neural mechanisms for speech and music that are underlying such generalization or transfer effects, such that strengthening the shared mechanisms through music is beneficial for speech processing as well (Patel, 2014).\nIn spite of these powerful demonstrations of changes in phonetic perception during the sensitive period, the neural mechanisms underpinning these experiential effects remain a topic of intense research interest (Kuhl, 2010). Previous EEG (Conboy and Kuhl, 2011; Lytle et al., 2018) and MEG (Kuhl et al., 2014; Zhao and Kuhl, 2016, 2022) studies have largely leveraged the mismatch negativity/response (MMN/MMR), generally considered to reflect higher-level neural processes that take place with much longer onset latency (e.g., onset after 150 ms) (Naatanen et al., 2007).\nIn contrast to previous studies, the current study focuses on the sensory encoding of speech that takes place with much shorter latencies, reflecting processing at much earlier stages along the auditory pathway, including the auditory brainstem. Particularly, these earlier auditory processing stages play a fundamental role in the sensory encoding or representation of acoustic attributes of speech, such as pitch. And the quality of such representation in the early stages of auditory processing are highly relevant for speech perception (Reetzke et al., 2018). Here, we examined the overarching question of whether early sensory encoding of speech is altered by experience during the sensitive period.\nThe measure used to assess early sensory encoding of speech is the frequency-following-response (FFR), a scalp recorded electrophysiological signal with short latency that robustly reflects phase-locking activity from multiple neural ensembles within the auditory system, especially at the earlier stages of processing (Coffey et al., 2019). The FFR provides an ideal means by which to evaluate the neural encoding of linguistically relevant, time-varying signals, such as pitch in lexical tones. Critically, the FFR has also been shown to be sensitive to an individual\u2019s language and music experience in adults and older children (Skoe and Chandrasekaran, 2014). For example, tonal language speakers were observed to elicit FFRs that were better tracking the pitch of lexical tones than non-tonal language speakers (Krishnan et al., 2005; Bidelman et al., 2011). A recent study also showed that adults\u2019 neural pitch tracking of lexical tones, as reflected in FFR, can be altered with even a short-term intensive laboratory-based training on lexical tones\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience 02 frontiersin.org\n(Reetzke et al., 2018). Further, the generalization effect from music training to speech encoding was also observed in a study in which highly trained English-speaking adult musicians demonstrated better neural pitch tracking in their FFR to lexical tones than their non-musician counterparts (Wong et al., 2007).\nThe key question is thus whether auditory experience has an effect on sensory encoding of speech as reflected in the FFR, as early as in infancy during the sensitive period, or alternatively, whether changes only occur after a prolonged period of accumulation of auditory experience. There has been limited use of FFR to assess speech processing in infants (Lemos et al., 2021). In neonates, pitch tracking quality in FFR for lexical tones was observed to be distinct between infants born in China as compared to infants born the United States (Jeng et al., 2011, 2013). In older infants, enhancement have been documented for some aspects of FFR to native speech sounds, presumably reflecting developmental maturation of the auditory system (Anderson et al., 2015; Skoe et al., 2015; Musacchia et al., 2018; Novitskiy et al., 2021). No study that we are aware of has focused on the FFR during the sensitive period using longitudinal comparisons of infants with experimentally manipulated experiences to address this theoretical question.\nIn the current study we addressed this overarching key question by testing two specific hypotheses. First, we hypothesized that the perceptual narrowing phenomenon during the sensitive period can be detected in the early stages of sensory speech encoding. We tested this hypothesis by comparing sensory encoding, as reflected by FFR, of a non-native Mandarin Chinese lexical tone in English-learning infants measured longitudinally at 7 and 11 months of age. A second hypothesis was that the addition of music intervention during the sensitive period would reverse the perceptual narrowing effect for the non-native Mandarin tone. We tested this hypothesis by examining an additional group of infants who were randomly selected to receive a highly social music intervention in a controlled lab setting from 9 to 10 months of age, in between the two measurements of speech encoding (i.e., FFR) at 7- and 11- months of age (Figure 1A)."

            "text": "Forty-three typically developing infants from monolingual English-speaking households were recruited at 24 weeks to participate in this longitudinal study. The inclusion criteria included the following: (1) full term and born within 14 days of the due date, (2) no known health problems and no more than 3 ear infections, (3) birth weight ranging from 6 to 10 lb., (4) no significant foreign language exposure (i.e., parents and regular caregivers speak only English to the infant) and (5) no previous or concurrent\nenrollment in infant music classes. All experimental procedures performed were in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki and were approved by the University of Washington Institutional Review Board. All participating families gave informed consent and were compensated monetarily for their time and effort.\nThe semi-random assignment of group (music-intervention vs. language-experience) happened prior to recruitment by interspersing blocks of time that are dedicated to recruit for one group (e.g., one month recruiting for music-intervention group). Families were not aware of the other condition and were invited for either a 2-session or a 14-session study. For the language-experience group, of the 26 infants who were tested at 7 months of age (mean age = 27.27 weeks, SD = 0.94, N of male = 14), two became too fussy before data recording (i.e., refused placement of electrodes). Twenty infants returned for testing at 11 months of age (mean age = 48.56 weeks, SD = 1.22, N of male = 10). Of these, two become too fussy before data recording. For the music-intervention group, of the 17 infants that were tested at 7 months of age (mean age = 28.05 weeks, SD = 1.06, N of male = 9), 1 became too fussy before data recording (i.e., refused placement of electrodes), and one was not able to complete all 12 sessions of intervention. All other infants returned for testing at 11 months of age and were able to complete the session (mean age = 47.74 weeks, SD = 0.98, N of male = 8). Overall, the study was terminated early with a smaller N than the original target (N = 20 in each group) due to COVID19 pandemic. The original target (N = 20) was determined based on an a prior power analysis with previous language and music intervention studies, using both behavioral and neural measures (Kuhl et al., 2003; Zhao and Kuhl, 2016), yielding power at 0.90 at a significant level of 0.05. This information was reported at clinicaltrials.gov under NCT04509739.\nInfants\u2019 backgrounds were surveyed through parental reports. For the language-experience group, at 7 months of age, the SES of the families averaged 53.64 (SD = 8.90) as measured by the Hollingshead scale. Ten of the 26 infants tested at 7 months of age were reported to have some level (Mean = 5.80 h/month, SD = 7.07) of foreign language exposure (i.e., music, library story time). Six were reported to live with an adult with significant music training (i.e., 8+ years of private lessons). On average, infants were estimated to have music exposure (i.e., parents singing, radio) for 20.57 h/week (SD = 13.44) at 7 months and an average of 26.35 h/per week (SD = 24.51) at 11 months. For the music-intervention group, at 7 months of age, the SES of the families averaged 51 (SD = 10.07) as measured by the Hollingshead scale. Ten of the 16 infants tested at 7 months of age were reported to have some level (Mean = 7.40 h/month, SD = 9.24) of foreign language exposure (i.e., music, library story time).

The raw data was offline referenced to the Refence channel, band-pass filtered between 80 and 2000 Hz and then epoched between -50 and 300 ms in relation to stimulus onset. Trials with excessive noise (\u00b1 35mV) were rejected. Only recordings with a minimal of 1500 accepted trials were used in the subsequent analyses. In total, 16 infants in the languageexperience group and 15 infants in the music-intervention group had accepted recordings at both 7 month and 11 month of age, and this dataset has been made publicly available on Open Science Framework (Zhao, 2022). The average number of accepted trials are 2380.90 (SD = 322.14) at 7 month and 2329.20 (SD = 382.21) at 11 month for the language-experience group, and 2188.20 (SD = 354.59) at 7 month and 2557.90 (SD = 340.72) at 11 month for the music-intervention group. Grand averaged FFR waveforms as well as spectrograms for both groups at both ages are visualized at Figure 1D.\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience 05 frontiersin.org\nDue to the low signal-to-noise ratio in individual infant FFR data for reliable f0 extraction, the f0 extraction was done on the group-averaged FFR and non-parametric permutation tests were used to statistically assess group-level differences for each comparison. To conduct the permutation tests, first, four group-level observed FFRs (i.e., language-experience group at 7 months, language-experience group at 11 months, musicintervention group at 7 months and music-intervention group at 11 months) were calculated by grand-averaging across all individual infant\u2019s FFR within the corresponding group and age, with each individual FFR calculated by averaging across the first 1500 trials (750 trials from each polarity). For each observed group-level FFR, the fundamental frequency (f0) was then extracted using a sliding window (40 ms long with 30 ms overlaps) autocorrelation-based method to search for f0 between 80 and 150 Hz, resulting in 21 pitch bins over the 250 ms segment (Xie et al., 2017).\nWe focused on FFR metrics that reflect the stimulus (i.e., pitch) tracking quality and calculated dependent measures from each group-level FFR. The main dependent measure was the f0correlation, calculated as the Pearson correlation coefficient was between the f0 extracted from the group-level FFR and the f0 extract from the stimulus. Additionally, f0-error was calculated by summing the absolute difference between the stimulus f0 from the FFR f0 across all pitch bins. The f0-correlation and f0-error reflect the accuracy of pitch tracking, but for relative changes vs. absolute values of stimulus pitch. Third, f0-strength was indexed by the peak autocorrelation value for each pitch bin, indicating the robustness of neural phase-locking to the f0 of the stimulus. In addition, we also calculated the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for each group-level FFR.\nWith the dependent measures, we conducted 3 statistical tests for our two main hypotheses. First, we tested that pitch tracking quality for the non-native Mandarin tone, as reflected by the FFR, would be lower at 11 months than at 7 months of age in the language-experience group, due to the expected perceptual narrowing effect. Then, we tested that the decline in pitch tracking quality, as measured with the FFR, would be reversed in the music-intervention group. Lastly, we tested that the changes between ages in pitch tracking quality are different between the language-experience group and the musicintervention group.\nTo test our first statistical hypothesis of whether pitch tracking quality declined from 7 to 11 months in the languageexperience group, individuals\u2019 FFRs from the languageexperience group at both ages were first shuffled and randomly assigned to a \u201cpermuted 7-month group\u201d and a \u201cpermuted 11-month group.\u201d Then, for the two permuted age groups, group-level FFRs were calculated, and the same measures were extracted to quantify pitch tracking quality (i.e., f0-correlation etc.). A between-age difference was then calculated for each measure (i.e., f0-correlation for the permuted 11-month group \u2013 f0-correlation for the permuted 7-month group). This process was repeated 1000 times and distributions were built for each\nmeasure demonstrating the permuted differences between 7 and 11 months of age for the language-experience group (Figure 3A). Critically, the observed difference (difference between observed 7 months and 11 months measured in the language-experience group) was compared against this permuted distribution and an Achieved Significance Level (ASL) can be calculated as the proportion in the permuted distribution where the permutated difference is more extreme than the observed difference.\nTo test our second statistical hypothesis of whether decline in pitch tracking quality from 7 to 11 months is reserved in the music-intervention group, the same permutation test was conducted to evaluate whether there is a difference between 7-month and 11-month group-level FFR in the musicintervention group.\nLastly, to test our third statistical hypothesis of whether there is a between-group difference in the change of pitch tracking quality from 7 to 11 months, a slightly different permutation procedure was adopted. Particularly, all individuals from both groups were randomly assigned into a \u201cpermuted language-experience group\u201d or a \u201cpermuted music-intervention group.\u201d Then, for each permuted group, the two group-level FFRs (i.e., one for 7 months and one for 11 months) were first calculated by using the corresponding data. The same measures were extracted, and between-age differences were calculated for all dependent measures. Then between-group differences were further calculated for each measure (e.g., between-group difference in f0-correlation change = f0-correlation change in music-intervention group \u2013 f0-correlation change in languageexperience group). This process was repeated 1000 times and distributions of permuted between-group differences can be visualized for each measure in Figure 3C, with each row for each dependent measure. Corresponding ASL values were calculated as the proportion in the permutation distribution where the permuted group difference is more extreme than the observed group difference."

            "text": "The current study addressed theoretically important questions regarding the neural mechanisms that underlie the sensitive period for phonetic learning in infants, one of the earliest and most important milestones in early language acquisition. Specifically, we examined whether early sensory encoding of speech is altered by experience during this very early period in development. We tested two hypotheses regarding this question. First, we tested the hypothesis that early sensory encoding of speech exhibits a decline for non-native speech during the sensitive period, reflecting the perceptual narrowing phenomenon related to increased native language experience. Second, we tested the hypothesis that music intervention during this period can reverse the decline and maintain the auditory systems\u2019 ability to track acoustic properties of non-native speech. This would bolster the hypothesis that during this early period of development, music experience can already strengthen the shared neural mechanisms for music and speech processing.\nWe measured monolingual English-learning infants\u2019 FFR to a non-native Mandarin lexical tone longitudinally at both 7 and 11 months of age. Between the two FFR measurements, infants were randomly assigned to receive either no intervention (language-experience group) or a 12-session music intervention (music-intervention group). The FFR revealed the precision\nwith which infants neurally tracked the pitch of the nonnative Mandarin tone. The results showed that (1) the precision of neural pitch tracking indeed declined in the languageexperience group, as expected due to the perceptual narrowing phenomenon, (2) the precision of neural pitch tracking was maintained with age in the music-intervention group, thus reversing the decline seen with the language-experience group, and (3) the change in neural pitch tracking from 7 to 11 months was different between the two groups. Our results therefore support both study hypotheses, suggesting that auditory experience in infants can affect their sensory encoding of speech in early stages of auditory processing.\nThe current results expand our current theoretical understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying the sensitive period for phonetic learning. To date, research has focused on the MMN/MMR, which reflects later and higherlevel neural processes. The current study instead focuses on the precision of sensory encoding of speech by examining the representation of the stimulus early in the auditory processing stages. Indeed, the results demonstrated that the effect of early auditory experience is pervasive; it extends to early encoding stages in the auditory system (i.e., FFR) very early in development (i.e., in infancy), and it demonstrates malleability with relatively short periods of additional experience (i.e., a 4-week music intervention). These results complement existing literature on adults and older children with vastly different early experiences (e.g., linguistic background, music training background) demonstrating differences in early sensory encoding (Wong et al., 2007; Kraus et al., 2014; Zhao and Kuhl, 2018), and suggest that these experiential effects may start accumulating during infancy. However, it is also important to note that the auditory system is also undergoing rapid maturation process during this period (Anderson et al., 2015; Novitskiy et al., 2021), and it is important for future research to disentangle the interaction between maturation and speech learning at the sensory encoding stage, by implementing additional conditions including native and non-native speech as well as non-speech stimuli.\nThe current results also provide new evidence supporting the idea of shared neural mechanisms for speech and music processing in infancy (Patel, 2011, 2014), that is, speech processing is enhanced when underlying shared neural mechanisms become strengthened by music intervention. Previous research has demonstrated that the same short-term laboratory controlled music intervention during the sensitive period can indeed generalize from the music domain to the speech domain (i.e., cross-domain generalization), by focusing on the MMR (Zhao and Kuhl, 2016). The current result replicates and extends the previous finding, demonstrating that generalization effects from music intervention to speech are not limited to later and higher-level neural processes, but are also observed in neural representation of acoustic features (e.g., pitch) in speech at the earlier stages of auditory processing.\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience 08 frontiersin.org\nA few caveats should be noted in this current study. First, while the current stimulus for FFR recording (i.e., /yi/ in tone 3) was selected given it was optimal for demonstrating languageexperience effects in adults (Llanos et al., 2017), it is still possible that the experiential effects (i.e., language and music) may manifest differently for other lexical tones and/or other speech sounds (e.g., consonants, vowels). Indeed, previous research has documented other developmental patterns for different speech sounds during the sensitive period (Best et al., 2016), and music intervention may affect different speech sounds (e.g., other lexical tones, consonants, vowels) differently. Thus, future replication and expansion using various speech sounds in both native and non-native languages are thus warranted for a more comprehensive understanding of the experiential effects on infants\u2019 speech learning.\nSecond, the language-experience group in the current study did not participant in any lab-sessions in between their FFR measurements. While this group allows accurate assessment of the effect of language experience in typically developing monolingual English-learning infants (i.e., language-experience group), it does not allow us to isolate effects of music intervention from activate lab visits for the music-intervention group. Given that the previous study using the exact same music intervention with an active control group (i.e., control group participated in same number of free play sessions in the lab) demonstrated a transfer effect on speech discrimination (Zhao and Kuhl, 2016), we concluded that the effects in the current study should also be largely from the music intervention. Future replication is needed and additional levels of controls (e.g., free play, passive music listening) are warranted to further elucidate the relative contribution of different components of the music intervention to the generalization effect, such as the movement or the social engagement. Further research is also needed to allow for a comprehensive understanding of the effects of music intervention on language development and whether the effects are similar for infants at risk for communication disorders as it is for typically developing infants. Understanding these questions will move us closer to an understanding of how effective early music intervention may be as an early intervention tool for communication disorders."
