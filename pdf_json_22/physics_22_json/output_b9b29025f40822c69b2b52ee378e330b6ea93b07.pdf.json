Experiments show that probabilistically-shaped PAM-6 and a framed-cross QAM32 constellation outperform conventional cross QAM-32 under a peak power constraint. Introduction Short-reach fiber-optic transceivers often use intensity modulation (IM) with direct detection (DD)[1]. The connecting links are usually operated without optical amplifiers, resulting in peak power constrained systems[2]. For these systems, it was shown in[3] that pulse-amplitude modulation with six levels (PAM-6) outperforms PAM-4 and PAM-8 at rates around 2 bits per channel use (bpcu). Cross-shaped QAM-32 (C-QAM-32) constellations (cf. Fig. 1a) can be used to generate PAM6 symbols[4],[5]. Using C-QAM-32 with a peak power constraint is sub-optimal under additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)[3]. Other options for generating PAM-6 are a framed-cross QAM32 (FC-QAM-32) constellation[3] (cf. Fig. 1b) and PAM-6 (QAM-36) generated with probabilistic amplitude shaping (PAS)[6] (cf. Fig. 1c). In[3] it was shown that FC-QAM-32 and PAM-6 via PAS gain 0.4 dB SNR over C-QAM-32 under symbol-metric decoding and 0.8 dB SNR under bit-metric decoding, when transmitting at a rate of 2 bpcu over an AWGN channel. In this paper, we conduct experiments at a symbol rate of 60 GBaud over 1 km of standard single-mode fiber (SSMF) and optical back-toback (B2B) experiments at a symbol rate of 95.6 GBaud. We show that the gains from[3] also apply to practical scenarios. The measured rate gains are not quite as large as for the AWGN case[3] but they nevertheless motivate using FC-QAM-32 rather than C-QAM-32. PAM-6 Transmission One cannot map bits directly to symbols from an input alphabet with cardinality six, since six is not an integer power of two. In the following, we present two ways to generate a sequence from a 6-ary input alphabet. We define the input alphabet as X = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. PAM-6 via QAM-32 Consider two-dimensional QAM-32 constellations for which 5 bits are directly mapped to a symbol. The \u201creal\u201d and \u201cimaginary\u201d parts of the symbols can be transmitted consecutively as PAM-6 symbols. C-QAM-32 is proposed for PAM-6 transmission in[4],[5], but[3] showed that C-QAM-32 is suboptimal under peak power constrained AWGN channels. Furthermore, there exists no Gray labeling for C-QAM-32, which results in a performance loss under bit-metric decoding. The proposed FC-QAM-32 constellation[3] is shown in Fig. 1b with according Gray labeling. By using the corner levels of the constellation, FC-QAM-32 does not increase the peak power, but provides a larger average Euclidean distance of the symbols at the receiver. This significantly increases the performance in AWGN channels. The maximum achievable information rate of both QAM-32 schemes is log2(32)/2 = 2.5 bpcu. PAM-6 via Distribution Matcher Probabilistic amplitude shaping (PAS)[6] for PAM-6 with a distribution matcher (DM) is studied in[3]. The same idea can be used to construct flexible QAM constellations[7] or to label QAM-32 with 6 bits[8]. The scheme is denoted as DM-PAM-6 and operates as follows. Consider a source that outputs k+\u03b3n uniformly distributed data bits d = (d1 , d k+\u03b3n k+1 ) (1) consisting of a length k sequence d1 , and a length \u03b3n sequence d k+1 , where n is the number of PAM-6 symbols in a forward error correction (FEC) frame.

We choose a uniform distribution for the distribution matcher, i.e., PA(a) = 1/3 for all a \u2208 A. The elements in A are labeled as bit-pairs from the set {01, 11, 10} which correspond to the second and third bit in the labeling in Fig. 1c. Labeling every symbol of the sequence an1 = (a1, . . . , an) results in a length 2n bit sequence b = (b1, . . . , bn), where bi is the length two bit label of the symbol ai. We concatenate b with the second part dk+\u03b3nk+1 of the source bits and obtain u = (b, dk+\u03b3nk+1 ) of length (2 + \u03b3)n bits. We feed u into a systematic FEC encoder that generates (1 \u2212 \u03b3)n parity bits p. The code rate of the FEC code is\nRFEC = (2 + \u03b3)n\n3n =\n2 + \u03b3\n3 . (2)\nWe assume that the parity bits in p are uniformly distributed[6]. We concatenate the (1\u2212 \u03b3)n parity bits p with the source sequence dk+\u03b3nk+1 and obtain the length n sequence s = (s1, . . . , sn) with uniformly distributed entries. The bit entries si \u2208 s are used as the first bit (MSB) in the labeling in Fig. 1c. Finally, we concatenate the si with the label bi to obtain the complete 3-bit label of the ith transmit symbol and map the label to the corresponding symbol from the input alphabet X .\nSimilar to the QAM-32 schemes, the presented DM-PAM-6 scheme can also be inter-\npreted as QAM-36 in two-dimensions as illustrated in Fig. 1c. Note that DM-PAM-6 also permits non-uniform input distributions (see[3]) which allows further optimizations.\nThe transmission rate of DM-PAM-6 is\nR = k\nn + \u03b3 bpcu. (3)\nFor large block lengths n and a suitable DM, the rate k/n approaches the entropy H(PA) of the density PA. For uniform PA, H(PA) \u2248 1.585bits. The DM-PAM-6 rate R in (3) ranges from R \u2248 1.585 bpcu to R = H(PA) + 1 \u2248 2.585 bpcu for \u03b3 = 0 and \u03b3 = 1, respectively.

The arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) operates at sampling rates 95.6GSamples/s and 120GSamples/s. The first sampling rate was used for 95.6GBaud transmission with 1 sample per symbol (SPS) and the latter for 60GBaud transmission with 2 SPS. The AWG signal is electrically amplified and drives a Mach-Zehnder modulator (MZM) that modulates a 1550 nm external cavity laser. The MZM is operated at the quadrature point. We consider either transmission over 1 km of SSMF or an op-\ntical back-to-back (B2B) configuration. Both setups are connected to a variable optical attenuator (VOA).\nAfter the VOA, a photodiode converts the optical intensity to an electrical current that is sampled by a digital storage oscilloscope (DSO) operating at 256GSamples/s and the samples are stored for offline processing. We perform synchronization and resample to 2 SPS before equalization with a Volterra equalizer, using 41 firstorder, 7 second-order and 5 third-order taps. The equalizer is trained based on an MSE objective. The equalized sequence is downsampled to the symbol rate to retrieve the symbols. For the setup with and without fiber, measurements are taken for different attenuation factors of the VOA. For 95.6 GBaud symbol rate transmission, we use an additional 3-tap noise whitening filter[9] and compute the symbol-wise a posteriori probabilities through the BCJR algorithm[10]."

Since the transmitted sequences from the experiments are usually not codewords of a FEC code, we apply the method of channel adapters and scrambling sequences[11].\nWe consider blocks of n = 1000 symbols. This results in a binary codelength of 2500 bits and 3000 bits for QAM-32 and DM-PAM-6, respectively. We use shortened BCH codes with a mother code length of 4095 bits for hard-decision decoding and low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes from the 5G standard for soft-decoding[12]. The transmission rate is adjusted by chang-\ning the code dimension. For DM-PAM-6, we use a constant composition distribution matcher (CCDM)[13].\nFig. 3 shows achievable information rates for transmissions at 60 GBaud symbol rate over 1 km SSMF, and at 95.6 GBaud symbol rate in optical B2B setup. For each attenuation factor, we adjust the transmission rate such that the frame error rate (FER) is 10\u22123. The results show that FC-QAM-32 gains between 0.2 dB and 0.4 dB over conventional C-QAM-32 for each scenario, when operating at a rate of 2 bpcu. The largest gains are for bit-metric soft-decoding with LDPC codes. Especially the FC-QAM-32 gains are noteworthy, since implementation complexity is the same as for C-QAM-32. DM-PAM-6 gains up to 0.5 dB over conventional C-QAM-32. For 95.6 GBaud, DM-PAM-6 shows smaller gains, especially for high attenuation."
