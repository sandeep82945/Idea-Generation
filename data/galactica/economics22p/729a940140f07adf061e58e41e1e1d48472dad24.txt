conclusion This study investigates the determinants of bank liquidity in Vietnam between 2007-2017. The results show that total assets, profitability and consumer price index are inversely and significantly correlated with the bank liquidity. In contrast, the national savings rate and financial market liquidity have positive impacts on the liquidity of banks. In Vietnam â€“ a bank-based financial system, it is interestingly noted that the growth in monetary supply growth has no significant effect on bank liquidity. To conclude, this research is a stepping effort to identify determinants of bank liquidity in developing economies with the bank-based financial market.
