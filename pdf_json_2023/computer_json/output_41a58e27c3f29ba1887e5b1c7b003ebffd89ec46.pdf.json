INTRODUCTION\nThe importance of Internet end-to-end delay metrics, such as the round trip time (RTT), is well established, as it can be used to assess performance, the status of a specific path, the quality of user experience, and real-time applications. Typically, delay measurements exhibit similar patterns when the routes followed contain shared segments. In [1], it was observed that delays between pairs passing through the same damaged Internet Exchange Point (IXP), presented synchronized pattern changes. An example of spatially correlated paths can be seen in Figure 1, which displays a group of Internet delay time series that exhibit similar behaviors. This similarity can be attributed to the underlying network routing.\nDespite these changes that can be due to congestion [2], path changes [3] or major Internet incidents [4], when observed over a long period, end-to-end delays display temporal stationarity as can be seen in figure 2.\nIn the networking community, Internet delay segmentation and characterization have been widely studied as an intriguing problem. Traditionally, the segmentation of delays has been left to human experts, as illustrated in Figure 2, which demonstrates how easily an individual can perform this task. Nonetheless, with the abundance of data available on platforms such as Ripe Atlas and Caida [5], as well as on private ISP servers, relying on human analysts to segment delays is both expensive and challenging. Therefore, there is a need for an automated layer and the creation of appropriate tools and algorithms to meet this increasing demand.\nMany works have aimed to model Internet delays in time [6], [7] in order to gain a better understanding of this metric and more insight into network performance and functioning [8]. Furthermore, Shao et al. [9] studied RTT segmentation in order to evaluate the impact of the routing changes at different levels (AS, IXP) on RTT changes, and Mouchet et al. [1] used HDP-HMM to detect IXP outages based on RTT changes frequency. Other characterization studies of the delays using different distributions have been conducted [10], [11], [12], as well as approaches based on deep learning [13].\nDespite the high accuracy of RTT series segmentation achieved in some cited works, the state of the art presents two primary issues. Firstly, the suggested methods are computationally intensive. Secondly, many studies only take into account temporal stability, without taking full advantage of spatial dependencies among RTT series. To the best of our knowledge, this paper proposes the first multivariate segmentation of delay networks based on joint segmentation of multiple delay time series.\nIn this paper, we explore the use of hierarchical clustering for the segmentation of multivariate network delays. ToISBN 978-3-903176-57-7 \u00a9 2023 IFIP\ncapture the spatial correlation in the dataset, we first apply hierarchical clustering on the Pearson correlation matrix of the RTT time series. Subsequently, when the clusters are identified, we jointly segment the time series within each cluster using hierarchical clustering. This clustering alone, however, does not incorporate the temporal stability property of these delays. Therefore, we propose a post-treatment step by exploiting the Viterbi algorithm, which is able to smooth the resulting clustering and handle the temporal dependency more effectively. Our global method is evaluated on two real-world datasets, demonstrating its suitability for managing delays with varying variance and changing patterns.\nThe paper is structured as follows. The second section is dedicated to the methodology accompanied by an illustrative example. It starts by presenting the hierarchical clustering, then explains the clustering of time series. Finally, the twostep multivariate segmentation using the Viterbi smoothed hierarchical clustering is described. The third section evaluates the methodology, first on the clustering of time series, then on the segmentation by comparing it to the most efficient state-ofthe-art method both in terms of accuracy and execution time. Finally, the fourth section concludes this work and outlines possible avenues for further research."

            "text": "Hierarchical clustering is a popular agglomerative clustering technique used to group variables based on similarity. This approach considers that each element is its own cluster initially. Then, clusters are iteratively merged into larger clusters. At each step, the two closest clusters are merged into one new parent cluster, and this process is repeated until a single global cluster remains after N-1 iterations, with N the number of variables [14]. This iterative clustering process can be represented in a dendrogram, a tree structure plot.\nThe similarity between clusters is measured using a linkage method, such as single (sgl), complete (cpl), average (avg), centroid (ctr), or Ward (wrd) linkage [15]. Single linkage considers the closest elements of the clusters, complete and average linkage considers the furthest elements and the average distance between all elements, respectively, and centroid linkage is based on the distance between the respective cluster centroids. Ward linkage minimizes the variance of the merged clusters, which is calculated by the error sum of squares defined for a given cluster C as ess(C) = \u2211 x\u2208C(x \u2212\n1 |C| \u2211 y\u2208C y)\n2, with |C| being the cardinal of the cluster C. The Ward linkage between two clusters C1 and C2 is then given by ess(C1 \u222a C2)\u2212 (ess(C1) + ess(C2).\nIn this paper, we use complete linkage for time series clustering and Ward linkage for the segmentation. In fact, we can see in table I that highlights pros and cons (in italic) of different linkage strategies [16] that ward and complete linkages are the only ones that can handle noise and outliers. The complete however is not good for handling stationarity since it tends to break large clusters."

            "heading": "B. The time series clustering",
            "text": "In this research, the hierarchical model is employed to efficiently cluster multivariate features. It is first used to make a profit from the spatial correlation of Internet delays by detecting groups of time series that display similar patterns. For this purpose, we introduce the following notation. We consider slotted time and suppose that a network containing n pairs of source/destination is observed during T timeslots. We observe the delay measurements between each source and destination of these pairs at different timeslots. D denotes the n-variate time series of length T , Di: the row i of the matrix D which represent the i \u2212 th observed time serie of delays and D:j the column j of the matrix D which represent the vector of measured delays at instant j.\nTo shed light on the spatial correlation among time series, a Pearson correlation matrix is computed between each two time series of the matrix D. A hierarchical clustering is then performed on the values of the correlation matrix. Finally, the rows and columns of the Pearson correlation matrix are reordered according to the resulting cluster labels. In this new matrix, diagonal blocks are formed and each block represents groups of time series with higher correlation.\nIn order to estimate the number of clusters within a given dataset, we must determine the dendrogram cut-off. To set this threshold we would like to minimize the number of clusters while maximizing the correlation of time series within each cluster. For this purpose, we define the following criterion: For a partition P of the dataset, we define the metric: h(P ) =\u2211\nc\u2208P 1 |c| \u2211 sk,sl\u2208c |corr(sk, sl)|, with corr(x, y) being the Pearson correlation between x and y. An example of this process is given in figures 3 and 4 that show the correlation matrix of 200 time series before and after the hierarchical clustering. We can notice that in the second figure, blocks of highly correlated pairs are formed and are easier to identify.\nIn order to have a closer look at the formed clusters, consider for instance figures 1 and 5 that show the time series within the last two formed clusters at the bottom right of the Pearson matrix after clustering. It is easy to notice that within\neach cluster, the time series show synchronous and similar patterns, whereas the pattern nature and temporal distribution change from one cluster to another. This property demonstrates that the change points are highly synchronized between correlated pairs. This motivates the intracluster segmentation that we prepare in the following. Let us denote by Dc the submatrix of D that contains the observed time series within the identified cluster c. Once the clusters of similar time series\nare identified, we are interested in segmenting jointly the delay time series within each cluster. In this second step, we first apply the hierarchical clustering on the columns of the matrix Dc. Figure 6 shows the result of this clustering. Despite the\neffectiveness of capturing the spatial correlation, hierarchical clustering imperfectly incorporates the temporal correlation and stability. To address this problem, we propose a Viterbi algorithm as a post-treatment.\nC. Viterbi smoothing post-treatment\nWe suggest capturing the temporal correlation by modeling the multivariate delays present in Dc for each identified cluster c using a hidden Markov model (HMM). This model considers that the observed delay vectors (Dci )i\u2264T are generated by some hidden states (sk)k\u2264m. In fact, the Markovian assumption regarding Internet delay changes is commonly used in the literature [1], [6]. The segmentation problem can hence be reformulated as follows: the segment labels are defined by the hidden states and the goal is to infer them based on the observed delay vectors. To this end, we use a Viterbi algorithm which is a dynamic programming algorithm for finding the most likely sequence of hidden states, called the Viterbi path, [17] that results in the sequence of observed events. It is commonly used in the context of Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). In simple terms, it calculates the most likely sequence of events that have led to the observed sequence.\nWe use the output of the hierarchical clustering segmentation on each matrix Dc to roughly identify the number of hidden states and estimate the emission probability of each state. In particular, we use observations identified within a cluster to initialize the distribution of emissions using either a density kernel method or a histogram method. Moreover, we consider a transition probability matrix to stress the fact that two successive delay vectors have more chance to be generated by the same hidden state. For this reason, we put ourselves in the context of a transition probability that is small compared to the probability of remaining in the same state. For the sake of simplicity, we define the transition probability m\u00d7m matrix Pt as follows: Pt(i, j) = \u03f5/(m\u22121) if i \u0338= j and Pt(i, i) = 1\u2212\u03f5, with m the number of hidden states. Choosing a small value of \u03f5 enforces states\u2019 persistence. Finally, we consider the hypothesis that the network states are initially equally distributed.\nHowever, this joint treatment of several time series is sensitive to the size of the cluster. Indeed, when the cluster contains many time series, the influence of the transition probability term tends to become negligible in front of the\nemission probability term resulting in weak smoothing. In order to overcome this imbalance, we introduce the following alternative regularization that depends on the cluster size, say N : the transmission probability is set to Pt(i, j) = \u03f5N/(m\u22121) if i \u0338= j and Pt(i, i) = 1\u2212 \u03f5N . This version of smoothing will be called regularized Viterbi smoothing.\nIf we consider the result of the hierarchical clustering in figure 6 and apply the Viterbi algorithm, we get the segmentation result in figure 7. We can see that the segments are smoothed and more stability is incorporated. To further improve these results we estimate again emission probabilities from this new segmentation and apply again the Viterbi algorithm. The final result is provided in figure 8 which displays a slightly more smoothed segmentation than figure 7.\nIn order to quantify the smoothing effect and measure the quality of the segmentation, we have chosen to use the adjusted Rand index. Indeed, the Rand index is a measure of similarity between two partitions of the same set and it represents the proportion of pairs of points that are grouped in the same way in the two partitions [18]. This index will allow us to decide the best variant of the method to choose in terms of the Viterbi version and the number of smoothings to use."

A high threshold, on the other hand, compresses the data, yielding a low number of clusters, but also presenting\nthe risk of combining time series with distinct patterns within the same group, making it difficult to achieve an accurate multivariate segmentation. To maximize the correlation within each cluster, a threshold is chosen that lies between these two extremes.\nIn this section, we are going to explore the impact of the different linkage methods on the clustering quality. We focus in particular on the comparison between Ward and complete linkage along with defining the optimal dendrogram cut-off threshold.\nWe can see in figure 9 that for RDC1 the optimal cut-off threshold is 0.2. When we cut the dendrogram at this value, we obtain the distribution given in table II and figure 10. We can clearly notice that a large part of the data remained unclustered with 16200 clusters containing one time serie. This being said the rest of the data were clustered in a homogeneous way, with the majority of clusters containing between 2 and 50 time series.\nTABLE II NUMBER OF CLUSTERS HAVING 5 TIME SERIES OR LESS\nNb of time series 1 2 3 4 5 Nb of clusters for RD1 16200 1393 544 316 180 Nb of clusters for RD2 5006 699 321 230 119\nFig. 10. Number of cluster having more than 5 time series for RD1\nWe should note that a maximum number of time series per cluster is 617 as can be seen in figure 11. We can see that the\nclustering detects the pertinent common patterns despite the presence of noise and outliers. Figure 12 shows on the other hand a cluster of time series with high stability in time. 11\nFigures 13 and 14 on the other side, presents two clusters with very similar patterns. We should notice that despite the similarity displayed between these clusters, the complete linkage separated them while they could have been grouped into one larger cluster. This result goes along with one of the cons of complete linkage described in table I which is the tendency to break large clusters.\nIn figure 15 we can see the dendrogram of the Ward linkage. On the x-axis we see the number of time series per cluster, knowing that each vertical line refers to an independent cluster. On the y-axis, we can see the distance between these clusters\nusing the Ward linkage. In this case, we can see that the clustering remains over the interval 1 to 10. Starting from 10 the process of agglomeration starts again. In order to have a clustering from this stable zone, the cut-off value was decided to be 8, leading to 30 clusters. It is optimal since it is the value that ensures a good trade-off between the number of clusters and the degree of their compression.\nOne difference that we can outline compared to the complete linkage, is the fact that the number of time series per cluster is very high. Moreover, in figures 17 and 18 , we can see that the pattern that was split using the complete linkage in figure 16 is totally grouped into one cluster of 1227 time series using the Ward method.\nIn figures 18 and 17 , we can notice that one drawback of the compression power of Ward is the fact that it will group together time series having a similar baseline, but not the same patterns. This is the case when the pattern in question is repeated peaks as we can see in figure 17). The complete linkage, on the contrary, didn\u2019t group these time series even though they have a common baseline behavior since they don\u2019t display a similar pattern change. Thus we see that tending to group series with a common baseline referred to as globular bias in table I is more present with the Ward method.\nA possible approach to take advantage of the pros of both methods is to first cluster the data using Ward linkage, then\nonce the homogeneous clusters are identified, we can treat them using segmentation for example. The rest of the data, that was grouped can be considered as a new dataset and clustered using complete linkage for a finer grouping in order to have more homogeneous clusters later.\nAfter the analysis of the RDC1, the same results were observed on RDC2. The cut-off threshold was set as well to 0.2 for the complete linkage and to 12 for the Ward method. In the figure and table, we can notice that complete linkage provided a similar distribution aspect of the number of time series per cluster. Furthermore, this clustering helps as well to explore the various patterns of delays along the global dataset.\nThe spatial correlation within the clusters An analysis was conducted on each cluster to investigate possible spatial correlations. Specifically, for the RDC2 dataset, we selected clusters with more than 10 time series, which represents a set with 3200 clusters, and determined the cardinality of the set of sources and destinations for each cluster. As shown in Figure 19, a high number of clusters has series with only a small number of sources or destinations. This suggests that spatial correlations can often be related to measurements with a common source or destination and potentially share common routes.\nD. Viterbi smoothing\nWe should note that the colors of the segments in the following figures refer to different states within the same segmentation, but are independent of one figure to another.\nIn this section, we evaluate the impact of some parameters on the smoothing in adequacy to the stationarity of the time series that corresponds to the sequence of states for each time serie. First, we show the impact of \u03f5 on the transition between states.\nFor values of \u03f5 ranging from 1e5 to 1e2, the distribution state doesn\u2019t change. An example of this can be seen in figures 20 and 21, where we can clearly notice that there is little difference between the state distribution for \u03f5 = 1e2 on the left and \u03f5 = 1e5 on the right. The state transitions remain consistent which indicates that the assumption regarding stability within the same state is validated in this model.\nFor the following experiences, we fix \u03f5 to 0.001 for the first\nsmoothing of Viterbi and to 0.0001 for the second smoothing, since we consider that the states are more stable after the smoothing leading to smaller transition probabilities between states.\nWe will now evaluate the segmentation quality and the impact of the number of time series in the cluster on both the quality of segmentation and the execution time. For this purpose, we compare the segmentation of each cluster with the segmentation of a representative of that cluster using both our method and the method based on the HDP-HMM.\nComparison with the HDP-HMM method: execution time We measured the processing time of the series per cluster for the method based on the histograms. We can see that a hierarchical plus Viterbi approach offers processing gain by a factor of 9 compared to HDP-HMM, as shown in Table III. The values given in the table are mean values for ten experiments and time series are 720 timeslots long.\nEffect of the smoothing on the number of states In figure 22 we show a summary of multivariate emission probabilities before and after the Viterbi smoothing. This summary is obtained by gathering data in all dimensions and computing the compounding kernel density estimator. We can notice that the number of states diminishes throughout the process passing from 12 to 4 states. This illustrates the smoothing effect that happens since the model adopted for the transition probabilities favors stability within one state instead of transitions. This enables us to get rid of states with low probability and replace them with more dominant ones in the segment.\nEffect of the smoothing on the segmentation Moreover, the impact of Viterbi smoothing is also very clear in terms of segmentation quality. In fact, in figure 23, we can notice that the segments become more homogeneous from figure 23 (a) to 23(c). The cluster represented in figure 23 presents roughly two major states: one that is stable and one that has a high variance. At the end of the process in figure 23(c) we can see that the stable state (in green) is well segmented, and the unstable state on the other hand is separated into two segments. This segmentation makes sense since the delay distribution\nis homogeneous within the blue segments while presenting higher values and a maximum peak in the yellow one.\nGlobal patterns VS local patterns When segmenting jointly a high number of series, we can notice the fact that local patterns that are specific for each time serie tend to disappear from the segmentation result of the whole cluster. For instance, many local peaks first detected with hierarchical clustering in figure 23(a) were merged to a more global state (in green) in figure 23(c). This phenomenon can also be noticed in univariate segmentation with the HDP-HMM method in figure 24 where we can see that in 24 (a) and 24 (b) visible peaks that are small compared to the overall time serie variation level are segmented along with the stable baseline of the time serie. But\nwe should note however, that for both our approach and the HDP-HMM, if an isolated peak or pattern is visible enough it still can be detected by being in a separate segment as is the case in figures 24 (b) and 23(c).\nEffect of the number of time series In figure 25 we highlight the impact of the number of time series inside the cluster on the segmentation quality. In fact, as we can see in figure 24, the segmentation of three time series that belong to the same cluster using the HDP-HMM is different despite the similarity. This means that each time serie has its own specificities that can be related to the path taken or to other network properties.\nWhen segmenting jointly a high number of time series as is the case in 25 (a), the smoothing effect wasn\u2019t very efficient\ncompared to figure 23. We can see that for a smaller number of time series, 10 in 25 (b) and 3 in 25 (c), the segmentation is better smoothed and is closer to the one given by the HDPHMM.\nEffect of the Viterbi regularization on clusters with high cardinality We used the average adjusted Rand index of time series in a cluster as a function of its cardinal for the four variants of the method. It is computed between the multivariate segmentation given by the cluster and the univariate segmentation given by the HDP-HMM for each series in this cluster. It has been shown that the contribution of the post-processing steps always improve the quality of segmentation compared to hierarchical clustering alone. It has also been observed that the Viterbi regularized version with one run shows the best results. Therefore, when treating jointly a high number of time series we choose the regularized version with only one pass of Viterbi as the segmentation strategy."

            "text": "This paper suggests a multivariate segmentation approach for network delays. It takes advantage of the spatial correlation between pairs of a network and their temporal stability. The method is based on hierarchical clustering and on the Viterbi algorithm. The hierarchical clustering for time series enabled us to group a large number of series having similar patterns. We have seen that the linkage method adopted has an impact on the homogeneity of the patterns within the same cluster. Complete linkage tends to give more homogeneous clusters but does not have a big compression power, whereas Ward linkage gives clusters with a large number of elements. The spatial correlation within clusters has also been proved, since most clusters show the presence of common sources or destinations. When the clusters are defined, the process of segmentation begins by applying again the hierarchical clustering followed by the Viterbi algorithm. We have shown the impact of Viterbi smoothing on the enhancement of the segmentation quality. Its results are similar to the ones given by HDP-HMM. Finally, we have shown that the computational burden is reduced by a factor of 9 compared to HDP-HMM. In future work, we will investigate more in depth the reasons behind the spatial correlation based on the network topology by using traceroutes measurements. Next, we will explore spatial correlation as a tool for dimensionality reduction for some smart monitoring schemes by considering only a few representatives of the cluster. Moreover, we will apply this method to a real-world use case such as Internet exchange points incidents. It will be interesting as well to cross-reference our segmentation results with the routing information in the perspective of performing root-cause analysis."
