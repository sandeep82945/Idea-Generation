    "abstractText": "Three novel compounds (1\u20133) along with twenty-six known compounds, two known steroids (4\u20135) and twenty-four known phenylpropanoids (6\u201329) were isolated from the whole plant of Thesium chinense Turcz. The structures of the three new compounds were elucidated on the basis of ESI-MS, HR-ESIMS, 1D and 2D NMR, IR, UV spectroscopic data. The absolute stereochemistry of compound 1 was determined by the Gauge-Including Atomic Orbitals (GIAO) method. The in vitro antioxidant, anti-inflammatory and cytotoxic activities of the isolated compounds were evaluated by DPPH radical-scavenging assay, LPS-activated RAW 264.7 cells model and CCK-8 kit, respectively. Compound 11 showed high antioxidant activity with an SC50 value of 16.2 \u00b1 1.6 \u03bcM. Compound 21 showed considerable anti-inflammatory activity with an IC50 value of 28.6 \u00b1 3.0 \u03bcM. Compounds 4 and 5 displayed potent cytotoxic activity against human NCI-H292, SiHa, A549, and MKN45 cell lines, with the compound 4 having IC50 values of 17.4 \u00b1 2.4, 22.2 \u00b1 1.1, 9.7 \u00b1 0.9, 9.5 \u00b10.7 \u03bcM, and the compound 5 having all IC50 values less than 0.1 \u03bcM in vitro.",

            "text": "There are approximately 350 species of the genus Thesium (Santalaceae) occurring worldwide in Africa, Europe, Asia, South America and North America [1]. Thesium chinense Turcz, a small perennial and hemi-parasitic plant belonging to the family Santalaceae, distributes in East Asia (China, Japan, Korea, and Mongolia) [2]. The whole plant of T. chinense, commonly called \u201cBai-Rui-Cao\u201d in China, was first recorded in the ancient medicinal monograph \u201cTu Jing Ben Cao\u201d in the North Song Dynasty 1000 years ago. In traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), Bai-Rui-Cao is entitled \u201cBotanical Antibiotics\u201d and is mainly used to treat different diseases including mastitis, pulmonitis, tonsillitis, laryngopharyngitis and upper respiratory tract infections. [3]. Previous studies have reported the presence of polysaccharides, flavonoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, D-mannitol, aromatic compounds and aliphatic acids in the plant of T. chinense [4,5]. Modern pharmacological studies have found that T. chinense has diverse activities including anti-inflammation [6], antimicrobial effect [7], analgesic activity [8], antioxidant activity [9] and anti-nephropathy [10]. The chemical and pharmacological investigations into T. chinense are carried out as part of our ongoing work on the discovery of the bioactive compounds from Chinese medicinal herbs. From EtOAc and n-BuOH extracts of T. chinense, three novel compounds (1\u20133), along with twenty-six known compounds, two known steroids (4\u20135) and twenty-four known phenylpropanoids (6\u201329) (Figure 1), are isolated. The structures of the new compounds (1\u20133) are identified on the basis of ESI-MS, HR-ESI-MS, 1D and 2D NMR, IR, UV spectroscopic evidence. To determine the absolute stereochemistry, compound 1 was subjected to the Gauge-Including Atomic Orbitals (GIAO) method. The\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2685. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28062685 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nisolated compounds are evaluated for their antioxidant, anti-inflammatory activities and in vitro cytotoxic activities against four human NCI-H292, SiHa, A549, and MKN45 cancer cell lines by using DPPH radical-scavenging assay, LPS-activated RAW 264.7 cells model and CCK-8 kit, respectively. Herein, we report the isolation, structure determination and activity evaluation, and we preliminarily discuss the structure\u2013activity relationship of the isolates."

The 1H and 13C NMR (Table 1) spectrum showed a secondary methyl signal at \u03b4H 1.26 (3H, d, J = 6.4 Hz, H-10), three tertiary methyl signals at \u03b4H 0.87 (3H, s, H-12), \u03b4H 1.11 (3H, s, H-13) and \u03b4H 1.21 (3H, s, H-11), two methylene signals at \u03b4H 1.59 (1H, ddd, J = 12.3, 4.3, 2.1 Hz, H-2), \u03b4H 1.75 (1H, tt, J = 12.2, H-2) and \u03b4H 1.87 (1H, m, H-4), \u03b4H 1.96 (1H, ddd, J = 13.3, 4.3, 2.2 Hz, H-4), two secondary carbinyl proton signals at \u03b4H 6.04 (1H, dd, J = 15.8, 1.3 Hz, H-7) and \u03b4H 5.78 (1H, dd, J = 15.8, 6.4 Hz, H-8), two set glucosyl anomeric protons [\u03b4H 4.54 (1H, d, J = 7.5 Hz, H-1\u2032) and \u03b4H 4.54 (1H, d, J = 7.5 Hz, H-1\u2032\u2032)]. In addition to the signals due to the above functional groups, the spectrum showed signals due to a quaternary carbon atom at 40.8 and two quaternary carbon atoms with an oxygen atom at \u03b4C 77.8, 79.1. The side chain structure was confirmed by the 1H-1H COSY correlations of H-10/H-9, H-9/H-8, and H-8/H-7. Furthermore, according to the HMBC correlations of H-11/C-1, C-2, H-12/C-1, C-6, H-2/C-4, C-6, H-4/C-5, H-13/C-4, and C-6, the 1H-1H COSY correlations of H-2/H-3, H3/H-4 and the NOESY correlations of H-2 (\u03b4H 1.59)/H-3 (\u03b4H 4.21), H-11 (\u03b4H 1.21)/H-2 (\u03b4H 1.59), H-3 (\u03b4H 4.21), H-7 (\u03b4H 6.04), H-12 (\u03b4H 0.87)/H-8 (\u03b4H 5.78) and H-13 (\u03b4H 1.11)/H-7 (\u03b4H 6.04), compound 1 was presumed to have a structure with a megastigm-7-ene carbon skeleton to which four hydroxyl groups are introduced on C-3, 5, 6 and 9. Further in HMBC (Figure 2), the correlation between H-1\u2032 [\u03b4H 4.54 (1H, d, J = 7.5 Hz)] with C-3 (\u03b4C 74.2) suggested that one \u03b2-glucosyl moiety was located at the C-3 position of the cycle. Correlations of HMBC from H-1\u2032\u2032 [\u03b4H 4.54 (1H, d, J = 7.5 Hz)] with C-2\u2032 (\u03b4C 83.7) and H-2\u2032 [\u03b4H 3.36 (1H, m)] with C-1\u2032\u2032 (\u03b4C 105.6) indicated that another \u03b2-glucosyl moiety was attached at the C-2\u2032 position. To determine the absolute stereochemistry, compound 1 was subjected to the Gauge-Including Atomic Orbitals (GIAO) method [11\u201313]. Compound 1 was represented at the mPW1PW91/631G(d) level two isomers 1a (3R, 5S, 6S, 9R) and 1b (3S, 5R, 6R, 9S) using Gaussian quantum chemistry NMR calculations and DP4+ probabilistic analysis. The results show that the configuration of 1a (3R, 5S, 6S, 9R) is more consistent with the experimental value of 1 (Figure 3) and has 99.96% DP4+ probability (Show in Supplementary Materials). Thus, the absolute configuration of compound 1 is confirmed and named as thesiumin A.\nCompound 2 was obtained as a white amorphous powder, and the molecular formula was confirmed as C20H30O13 by HR-ESI-MS (negative) (m/z 477.1610 [M\u2212H]\u2212, calcd. for C20H29O13, 477.1614). The 1H NMR spectrum of compound 2 showed the signals of two sets of methylene protons [\u03b4H 2.71(2H, t, J = 7.1 Hz, H-7) and \u03b4H 3.69 (2H, t, J = 7.0 Hz, H-8)], an ABX aromatic system proton [\u03b4H 7.15(1H, d, J = 2.0 Hz, H-2), \u03b4H 6.76 (1H, d, J = 8.1 Hz, H-5) and \u03b4H 6.80 (1H, d, J = 2.0, 8.1 Hz, H-6)], and two sets of glucosyl anomeric protons [\u03b4H 4.78 (1H, d, J = 7.8 Hz, H-1\u2032) and \u03b4H 4.74 (1H, d, J = 7.8 Hz, H-1\u2032\u2032)], which indicated the presence of 3,4- dihydroxyphenyl alcohol and two glucose units. Further comparison of the 1H and 13C NMR spectra of compound 2 with 3, 4-dihydroxyphenyl alcohol 3-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (6) [14] suggested that compound 2 contained one more glucose unit than 6. In HMBC (Figure 4), the correlation between H-1\u2032 [\u03b4H 4.78 (1H, d, J = 7.8 Hz)] with C-3 (\u03b4C 146.7) suggested one \u03b2-glucosyl moiety was located at the C-3 position of the aromatic cycle. Correlations of HMBC from H-1\u2032\u2032 [\u03b4H 4.74 (1H, d, J = 7.8 Hz)] with C-2\u2032 (\u03b4C 83.3) and H-2\u2032\u2032 [\u03b4H 3.75(1H, m)] with C-1\u2032\u2032(\u03b4C 105.7) indicated that another \u03b2-glucosyl moiety was attached at the C-2\u2032 position. On the basis of the above evidence, a new phenylethanoid glucoside was structurally determined as 3, 4-dihydroxyphenethyl alcohol 3-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranosyl (1\u21922)-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (2), named thesiumin B.\nCompound 3 was obtained as a white amorphous powder, and the molecular formula was confirmed as C18H32O13 by HR-ESI-MS (negative) (m/z 423.1871 [M\u2212H]\u2212, calcd. for C18H31O13, 423.1874). The 1H and 13C NMR (Table 2) together with the HSQC spectrum showed three sets of methylenes [\u03b4H 2.00 (2H, m, J = 7.3 Hz), \u03b4C 20.3, C-5; \u03b4H 3.44 (2H, m), \u03b4C 27.6, C-2; \u03b4H 3.74 (2H, m), \u03b4C 68.3, C-1], one methyl group [\u03b4H 0.91 (3H, t, J = 7.5 Hz), \u03b4C 14.3, C-6], one cis-configuration double bond [\u03b4H 5.34 (1H, dt, J = 11.3, 6.9 Hz), \u03b4C 125.4, C-3; \u03b4H 5.39 (1H, dt, J = 11.3, 6.9 Hz), \u03b4C 132.9, C-4], and two sets of glucosyl anomeric protons [\u03b4H 4.29 (1H, d, J = 7.7 Hz,), \u03b4C 101.4, C-1\u2032; \u03b4H 4.37 (1H, d, J = 7.7 Hz), \u03b4C 104.2, C-1\u2032\u2032], which indicated the presence of a carbon chain and two glucose units. In HMBC (Figure 4), the correlation between H-1\u2032 [\u03b4H 4.29 (1H, d, J = 7.7 Hz)] with C-1 (\u03b4C 68.3) suggested that one \u03b2-glucosyl moiety was located at the C-1 position of the carbon chain. Correlations of HMBC from H-1\u2032\u2032 [\u03b4H 4.29 (1H, d, J = 7.7 Hz)] with C-2\u2032 (\u03b4C 82.5) and H-2\u2032\u2032 [\u03b4H 2.98(1H, t, J = 8.2 Hz)] with C-1\u2032\u2032(\u03b4C 104.2) indicated that another \u03b2-glucosyl moiety was attached at the C-2\u2032 position. Furthermore, in HMBC, there was correlation between H-1 with C-3,\nand the 1H-1H COSY correlations of H-2/H-3, and H-4/H-5. Thus, compound 3 was identified as shown and named as (Z)-hex-3-ene 3-O-\u03b2-D- glucopyranosyl (1\u21922)-\u03b2-Dglucopyranoside, named thesiumin C.\nBeside the three novel compounds (1\u20133), twenty-six known compounds (4\u201329), including two steroids (4\u20135) and twenty-four phenylpropanoids (6\u201329), were also identified from the whole plants of T. chinense. Their strctures were determined as: perlplogemn [15] (4), periplocin [16] (5), 2-hydroxy-5-(2-hydroxy-ethyl) phenyl-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (6) [11], 3, 5-dihydroxyphenethyl alcohol 3-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (7) [17], phenethyl alcohol \u03b2-sophoroside (8) [18], samsesquinoside (9) [19], pinoresinol-4-O-D- glucoside (10) [20], syringaresinol-4\u2032-O-\u03b2-D-glucopyranoside (11) [21], dihydrodehydro diconiferyl alcohol 4-O-\u03b2-D-glucoside (12) [22], (7S, 8R) 9\u2032- methoxy- dehydrodiconiferyl alcohol 4-O-\u03b2-Dglucopyranoside (13) [23], picraquassioside C (14) [24], citrusin A (15) [25], citrusin B (16) [25], (erythro, erythro)-1-[4-[2-hydroxy-2-(4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-phenyl)-1-(hydroxy methyl) ethoxy]-3, 5-dimethoxy phenyl]-1, 2, 3-propanetriol (17) [26], 1-(4-hydroxy-3methoxy)-phenyl -2-[4-(1, 2, 3-trihydroxy propyl)-2-methoxy]-phenoxy-1, 3-propan-diol (18) [27], lariciresinol-4-O-\u03b2-D-glucoside (19) [28], ficusal (20) [29], 3-O-ethyl ferulate (21) [30], p-coumaric acid (22) [31], feruloylquinic acid (23) [32], syringin (24) [33], coniferin (25) [34], alatusol D (26) [35], scopolin (27) [36], scopoletin (28) [36] and sinapaldehyde\nglucoside (29) [37]. All the known compounds (4\u201329) were isolated from Thesium chinense Turcz for the first time.\n2.2. Bio-Activities of Compounds 2\u201329 2.2.1. Antioxidant Activity\nThe antioxidant activities of all the isolated compounds except compound 1 were evaluated using DPPH radical scavenging assay (Table 3). Comparing with positive control (ascorbic acid, SC50 = 15.5 \u00b1 0.8 \u00b5M), compound 11 showed high antioxidant activity with an SC50 value of 16.2 \u00b1 1.6 \u00b5M. Compounds 9, 10, 14, 17, 21 and 23 exhibited moderate activities with SC50 values ranging from 30.5 to 75.6 \u00b5M. Compounds 6, 7, 18 and 26 displayed weak antioxidant activities on radical scavenging.\n* nd, the weight was too small to conduct related detect. ** nc, SC50 cannot be calculated by GraphPad Prism 9.0 software due to weak or no related activities. SC50: radical-scavenging activity (concentration in \u00b5M required for 50% reduction of DPPH radicals).\n2.2.2. Anti-Inflammatory Activity\nThe in vitro anti-inflammatory activities of compounds 2\u201329 were evaluated by their inhibitory effects on NO production in LPS-activated RAW 264.7 cell models, and the results showed that most compounds had no anti-inflammatory activities except for ethyl ferulate (21) (Table 4). Compared with the positive control quercetin (IC50 = 11.1 \u00b1 1.4 \u00b5M), compound 21 displayed considerable anti-inflammatory activity with an IC50 value of 28.6 \u00b1 3.0 \u00b5M. Recent in vivo studies reported that ethyl ferulate (21) also displayed obvious anti-inflammatory effects against LPS-induced acute lung injury in mice [38,39].\n* nd, the amount of compound 1 was too small for activity detection. IC50 values were expressed as mean\u00b1 SD (n = 3).\n2.2.3. Cytotoxic Activity\nIn the CCK-8 assay, many of the isolated compounds from T. chinense showed moderate or considerable cytotoxic activities against four human cancer cell lines of A549, NCI-H292, SiHa and MKN45 (Table 5). Among them, Scopoletin (28) showed moderate and selective cytotoxic activity against MKN45 with the IC50 value of 52.8 \u00b1 5.3 \u00b5M. Perlplogemn (4) displayed potent cytotoxic activity against NCI-H292, SiHa, A549, and MKN45 with IC50 values of 17.4 \u00b1 2.4, 22.2 \u00b1 1.1, 9.7 \u00b1 0.9, and 9.5 \u00b10.7 \u00b5M, respectively. It is worth noting\nthat periplocin (5) demonstrated promising cytotoxic activity against the four human cancer cell lines with all the IC50 values less than 0.1 \u00b5M compared to that of the positive control cisplatin (IC50 = 7.0 \u00b1 0.3 \u00b5M).

            "text": "In summary, three new compounds (1\u20133) along with two known steroids (4\u20135) and twenty-four known phenylpropanoids (6\u201329) were isolated from the EtOAc and n-BuOH extracts from the whole plant of T. chinense. All the compounds were isolated from this species for the first time. The isolates except for compound 1 are evaluated for their antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities as well as their in vitro cytotoxic activities against four human cancer cell lines. The two new biglycosides (2 and 3) have no activity. Only compound 21 displayed considerable anti-inflammatory activity with an IC50 value of 28.6 \u00b1 3.0 \u00b5M by inhibited LPS-induced NO production in RAW 264.7 cells. Most phenylpropanoids with a phenolic hydroxyl group displayed significant or moderate scavenging activity on DPPH radicals (Table 3). Compared to the positive control ascorbic acid, the three furofuran lignan glycosides (9\u201311) and tetrahydrofuran lignan glycoside (19) displayed significant scavenging activity on DPPH radicals. The two oxyneoligan 17 and 18 showed moderate activity, and compound 17 displayed much stronger activity than that of 18, which indicated that the methoxy substitution on the benzene ring could enhance the activity. Two phenylethyl derivatives 6 and 7 exhibited weak activity. The phenylpropanoids 8, 12\u201316 and 29 without phenolic hydroxyl group did not show activity, which suggests that the phenolic hydroxyl group may be one of the key factors in the enhancement of the antioxidant activity. Two steroid compounds 4 and 5 with \u03b1,\u03b2-unsaturated lactone ring showed extremely strong cytotoxicity against all four tested cancer cell lines, with IC50 values ranging from < 0.1 to 22.2 \u00b1 1.1 \u00b5M, relative to the positive control, cisplatin (IC50 values from 7.0 \u00b1 0.3 to 52.8 \u00b1 5.3 \u00b5M). In particular, compound 5 showed the strongest cytotoxicity, and its four IC50 values were less than 0.1 \u00b5M. Compound 5 was formed by O-glycosylation\nat C-3 of 4, which allowed us to reach a preliminary deduction that O-glycosylation at C-3 caused a more positive effect on cytotoxic activity. Compound 28 showed highly selective cytotoxic activity against MKN45 with the IC50 value of 52.8 \u00b1 5.3 \u00b5M among the four human cancer cell lines. Of all the compounds tested, only compounds 4, 5 and 28, with \u03b1, \u03b2-unsaturated lactone ring, showed certain cytotoxicity, which suggested that \u03b1, \u03b2-unsaturated lactone ring was an active functional group of anti-tumor, and this research result is consistent with the literature report [44]. This study not only revealed the structural diversity of the chemical components of T. chinense, but also provided lead compounds for the development of antioxidants, anti-inflammatory and antitumor agents, and promoted reasonable use of this herb.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28062685/s1, Figures S1\u2013S34 showing 1D, 2D NMR, MS-ESI, HRMS-ESI, IR, UV, rotation spectrum of 1\u20133 and Tables S1\u2013S3 showing \u201cGIAO\u201d method results and Energies of the calculated configuration of 1a, 1b.\nAuthor Contributions: Z.-Z.L.: conceptualization, investigation, data curation and writing\u2014original draft preparation.
