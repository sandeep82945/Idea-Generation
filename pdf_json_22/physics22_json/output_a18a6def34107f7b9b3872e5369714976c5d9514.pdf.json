    "abstractText": "We present an apparatus to overcome the limitations of mechanical raster-scanning in electromagnetic induction imaging (EMI) techniques by instead performing a 2D optical raster-scan within the vapour cell of a radio-frequency atomic magnetometer (RF-AM). A large cuboidal Rb vapour cell is employed to act as the medium of an RF-AM with the pump and probe beams translated in the cell via acousto-optics. The technique is shown to give robust and repeatable magnetic measurements over the cell volume and successfully resolves conductive targets with EMI. Optical raster-scanning removes the limitation of slow mechanical actuation and a fast imaging procedure is enacted resolving conductive targets at a rate of 40 ms/pixel.",

Introduction Electromagnetic induction imaging [1] (EMI) invites the potential for a non-contact non-destructive inherently safe imaging technique suitable for applications in biomedicine, security and surveillance, and industrial monitoring [2]\u2013 [4]. The use of an oscillating magnetic field (primary field) to induce eddy currents in the target material generates a reciprocal oscillating magnetic field (secondary field) with properties that reveal the electrical and magnetic characteristics of the material. The secondary field can then be measured with a magnetic sensor and atomic magnetometers (AMs) offer the potential to unlock extreme sensitivity in the low-frequency regime [5]\u2013[7], with immediate applications in through-barrier imaging [8], [9] and potential applications in human organ screening [10]. Using EMI to image conductive objects with AMs has been successful in several previous experiments [3], [4], [11]\u2013 [14] but so far all previous implementations have required either moving the object or the sensor. Moving the object\nB. Maddox, H. Yao, Y. Cohen, F.

On the other hand, moving the sensor, while experimentally demonstrated [9], [15], [16], poses limitations in the stability and repeatability of the AM measurement. In both cases, the speed at which an image can be taken is limited by the speed of movement from pixel to pixel which can be on the order of seconds when using mechanical actuators.\nHere we present an apparatus to overcome these issues by instead optically moving the sensor volume within the atomic vapour cell. Deflection of the pump and probe beams via Acousto-Optical Deflectors (AODs) translates the beams within the vapour cell and allows the movement of the pump-probe intersection. This method circumvents the need for any moving parts, with the speed of sensor movement limited only by the rise time of the AOD (< 10\u00b5s). The minimum pixel size is limited only by the diffusion length of the 87Rb atoms through the sensor volume (1.95 mm for our experimental conditions), with no restriction on spacing between pixels. The method allows for a sequential measurement of a tightly spaced AM array, without the complexity of numerous polarimeter setups and high optical power that would be required for a concurrent array measurement.\n0000\u20130000/00$00.00 \u00a9 2021 IEEE\n\u00a9 2023 IEEE.

Experimental setup Fig 1 shows a schematic of the optical setup of the magnetometer. The magnetometer interaction scheme is similar to previous implementations of radio-frequency (RF) magnetometers [17], [18]. A room-temperature cuboidal isotopically-enriched 87Rb vapour cell of dimensions 60\u00d760\u00d720 mm3 (W\u00d7L\u00d7H) acts as the atomic medium with 500 Torr of He buffer gas and 100 Torr of N2 quenching gas. The pump laser is detuned +1.8 GHz from the |F = 2\u27e9 \u2192 |F \u2032\u27e9 transition on the D1 line of 87Rb. The probe laser is detuned by +7.6 GHz from the |F = 1\u27e9 \u2192 |F \u2032\u27e9 transition on the D2 line of 87Rb. The probe is linearly polarised, has a 1/e2 diameter of 2.5 mm in the x-z plane and propagates along x\u0302, while the pump is circularly polarised, has a 1/e2 diameter of 3.4 mm in the x-z plane and propagates along z\u0302. A cubic three-axis Helmholtz coil system, centred on the vapour cell, creates the magnetic fields necessary for the RF magnetometer. A DC magnetic field in the z\u0302 direction induces a bias field of BBias = 150 mG which creates Zeeman splitting of the F = 2 hyperfine manifold, setting the magnetometer resonance at \u03c90 = 2\u03c0\u00d7 105 kHz. The system is unshielded with the aforementioned three pairs of square Helmholtz coils, orthogonally aligned and centred on the cell, providing magnetic compensation. An array of 4 fluxgate sensors (Stefan-Mayer FLC100) arranged in a rectangular formation centred on the vapor cell, sits in the x-z plane (155\u00d7115 mm2) and measures the bias field in the z\u0302 direction. The use of an array of fluxgate\nsensors allows the inference of the magnetic field at the centre of the cell without requiring spatial access [19], [20]. The fluxgate array measurement is then stabilised via a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller (SRS SIM960) that controls the bias coil current. The Helmholtz coils in the x\u0302 and y\u0302 directions are used to compensate for ambient magnetic fields and to align BBias to z\u0302.\n\u00a9 2023 IEEE.

Restrictions apply.\n3 A square RF coil generates an AC magnetic field BRF that oscillates at a frequency \u03c9RF in the y\u0302 direction. With dimensions 55\u00d755 mm2, the RF coil is larger than the imaging area to provide a near-uniform field and is positioned 25 mm above the cell allowing space for the target object to be placed. The probe beam interacts with the atomic medium before its polarisation is measured by a polarimeter, formed by a polarising beam-splitter (PBS) and a balanced photodetector. BRF drives the Larmor precession of the atoms about BBias imprinting a polarisation oscillation onto the probe which is then read out by a dual-phase lock-in amplifier referenced at \u03c9RF .\nThe buffer gas reduces the mean free path of the 87Rb atoms such that two vital conditions are achieved. Firstly, the atom-light interaction time is increased leading to a longer transverse relaxation time which increases the sensitivity of the magnetometer. Secondly, since the motion of the atoms is restricted, the detected RF field in a measurement pertains only to atoms that diffuse across the volume of intersection between the pump and probe beams during a measurement cycle.\nThe movement of the pump and probe beams is achieved via AODs (AA DTSX-400-780) which diffract the beams by an angle \u03b8B according to the Bragg condition\nsin \u03b8B = m \u03bb\n2n\u039b (1)\nwhere \u03bb is the wavelength of the incoming light, \u039b is the wavelength of the sound wave in the AOD, n is the refractive index of the AOD crystal and m is the order of diffraction. Both beams enter their own respective AODs and the first order of diffraction is taken as the emergent beam, with the other orders blocked. The small angle \u03b1 between the first order and the zeroth order beams is then given by\n\u03b1 = \u03bb\u03bd\nVs (2)\nwhere \u03bd is the frequency of the signal driving the AOD, and Vs = \u039b\u03bd the speed of the sound wave. The first order beam is then incident on an f = 1000 mm plano-convex lens, which is placed at a distance from the AOM equal to the focal length, and thus converts the angular deviation of the beam to a translation across the cell. The focal length f determines the extent to which a beam can be rasterscanned across the cell. We note that the required large values of f do not hinder a potential miniaturization of the instrument, as the beams can be folded many times with the help of mirrors, so to ensure a long path in a reduced space. Applying the specific parameters of the system to equation (1) we find that for small angles, the translation of the beam position x in the cell dx/d\u03bd = f\u03bb/Vs = 1.2 mm/MHz. Sweeping an AOD driving frequency range of \u2206\u03bd = 50 MHz gives a full raster scan of the beam across the cell width. We have experimentally confirmed this by measuring the movement of the beam after the lens. The position of pump-probe intersection in the cell can then be swept in a 2D array in the x-z plane, with each intersection corresponding to a pixel of the EMI image. The size of the\narray can be made to be any n\u00d7 n array. For each pixel measurement, \u03c9RF is swept through \u03c90 \u2212 5\u0393 \u2192 \u03c90 + 5\u0393 where \u0393 = 2\u03c0\u00d7 2.4 kHz is the linewidth (full width at half maximum) of the magnetic resonance. The dualphase lock-in amplifier (LIA) extracts the in-phase X(\u03c9) and quadrature Y (\u03c9) components oscillating at \u03c9RF . X is fitted to a Lorentzian profile while Y is fitted to a dispersive profile. The radius R(\u03c9) = \u221a X2 + Y 2 and phase \u03d5(\u03c9) = atan2(Y,X) are then calculated with the fitted parameters of X and Y, for each pixel.\nIII. Rapid imaging performances FIG 3 shows the recorded X and Y traces for the centre and corner positions of the whole imaging area, demonstrating the ability to achieve a magnetic resonance across the cell. The resonant frequencies of the outer pixels shift relative to the central pixel resonance showing that BBias is inhomogeneous over the imaging area, a feature picked up by the AM as during the measurements the sensing volume is moving with respect to the static magnetic field. While this is an additional complication with respect to the mechanically-translatable AM [15], it is easily circumvented by tracking the whole resonance for each pixel and extracting the resonant frequency from the Lorentzian lineshape fitting. The frequency distribution across the imaging area of \u03c90\u00b12\u03c0\u00d7 2 kHz gives a negligible change in the skin-depth of the Cu targets (201 \u00b1 1) \u00b5m. The amplitude of the magnetic resonances across the imaging area is also inhomogeneous (further reinforced in FIG 4a) necessitating a prior background measurement to accommodate for this. The system is then set to scan an area of 38 mm \u00d7 38 mm in increments of 1 mm. A 25 mm \u00d725 mm copper square with a thickness of 1 mm acts as the target and is placed between the RF coil and the cell as illustrated in FIG 2. Images are taken with, and without, the target. Background images without any target are used to calibrate the instrument prior to its deployment. In fact, normalising the target image by the background image accommodates for the inhomogeneity of the magnetometer amplitude across the scanning area, where a decreased amplitude would show a decreased efficiency for measuring a change in field. The normalisation is done by dividing each background pixel by the corresponding target pixel, leading to the normalised image. Typically, owing to the repeatability of the system, only one background image is required with no need to repeat this from target to target. We note that the measured radius R contains both contributions from primary and secondary field. Thus, in the final images we report the normalised variation \u2206R so that zero corresponds to the object-free background while unity corresponds to the conductivity of the object. FIG 4 shows the target, background and normalised images for the copper square target. While the effect of the Cu square can be seen in the target image, higher contrast is achieved when normalizing to the background.\nThe pixel duration, can be broken down into three distinct periods: the optical translation of the pump and\n\u00a9 2023 IEEE.

Both images are normalised with the background as in FIG 4c and are on the same spatial scale. Images are reported in terms of normalised variation \u2206R, following the same procedure as in Fig. 4.

The use of the AODs significantly reduces the time spent rastering through the pixels compared to mechanical actuation rending this phase negligibly short. Quantitatively, for the current setup the time spent rastering through pixels is less than 10 \u00b5s/pixel. This has to be compared with previous setups, where the time rastering between pixels was of the order of 1 s/pixel, as dominated by the time taken to displace the object [17] or the sensor [15]. For computer control, a LabVIEW script is implemented to run the experiment and is limited by the computer iteration loop on the order of \u223c100 ms/pixel. However, sequencing the control events in hardware can allow control signals to be pre-programmed and limited to the DAC (digital-to-analog converter) risetime <1 \u00b5s/pixel, effectively removing this latency. Ultimately this leaves the measurement duration as the main limiting factor on imaging speed. Previously, as in FIG 4, the full resonance is swept per pixel with a full LIA measurement needed for each value of \u03c9RF in the sweep. To speed up the imaging process this can be reduced to 1 point, at\n\u00a9 2023 IEEE. Personal use is permitted, but republication/redistribution requires IEEE permission.

The repeatability of the bias field stabilisation allows for a predictable resonant frequency at each pixel, allowing \u03c9RF to be predetermined from the fitted resonances in the background image. FIG 5 shows the employment of this procedure, to resolve a Cu square (25\u00d7 25 mm2) and a Cu right-angled triangle (of side length 25 mm). Utilising this scheme allows a measurement duration of 40 ms/pixel.\nIV. Conclusions\nThe method outlined in this article enables fast EMI measurements in a sequential array without the complexity required for a concurrent array measurement. A concurrent array measurement - see e.g. [21] - would require a balanced detector array with the number of pixels matching the resolution of the EMI image. To replicate the image in FIG 4 this requirement would be on the order of thousands of balanced detectors, which can be challenging to produce with very low noise and low crosstalk between pixels. The sequential array method also allows for adjustments at each pixel, where inhomogeneity in the working conditions (for example bias field) can be accommodated for. In principle, the imaging size is only limited by the dimensions of the atomic medium. Glassblown cells or vacuum systems can be engineered to the meter scale, enabling an imaging size that would for example, be appropriate for luggage screening. Rapid imaging of objects over a wide range of conductivities would be possible [3], with the active compensation system also allowing imaging of ferromagnetic objects. Programming the experimental sequence to hardware would effectively remove the latency of control electronics allowing the imaging speed to be reduced to the measurement duration. Improvements in the magnetic sensitivity will allow for further reductions in the required measurement duration. The present work demonstrates how to overcome the major bottleneck of EMI-AM - speed - by rasterscanning the laser beams. This allows rapid EMI while retaining all the features of EMI-AM demonstrated in past work, such as sub-mm resolution [22], through-barrier imaging [8] and detection of subsurface anomalies [23], [16].\nReferences\n[1] H.
