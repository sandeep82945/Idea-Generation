    "abstractText": "In this work, we study the unpredictability of seasonal infectious diseases considering a SEIRS model with seasonal forcing. To investigate the dynamical behaviour, we compute bifurcation diagrams type hysteresis and their respective Lyapunov exponents. Our results from bifurcations and the largest Lyapunov exponent show bistable dynamics for all the parameters of the model. Choosing the inverse of latent period as control parameter, over 70% of the interval comprises the coexistence of periodic and chaotic attractors, bistable dynamics. Despite the competition between these attractors, the chaotic ones are preferred. The bistability occurs in two wide regions. \u2217ecgabrick@gmail.com Preprint submitted to https://www.105groupscience.com/ December 9, 2022 One of these regions is limited by periodic attractors, while periodic and chaotic attractors bound the other. As the boundary of the second bistable region is composed of periodic and chaotic attractors, it is possible to interpret these critical points as tipping points. In other words, depending on the latent period, a periodic attractor (predictability) can evolve to a chaotic attractor (unpredictability). Therefore, we show that unpredictability is associated with bistable dynamics preferably chaotic, and, furthermore, there is a tipping point associated with unpredictable dynamics.",

            "text": "The study of the spread of diseases is an important interdisciplinary research topic [1]. Mathematical models are essential to understanding, forecasting, and studying control measures for infectious diseases spread [2]. In general, the epidemic models are compartmental, i.e., they divide the host population (N) into compartments, for instance susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I), and recovered (R) [3]. S is related to healthy individuals who can contract the disease. E corresponds to the individuals in latent [4] and/or incubation period [5]. In the latent period, the individuals can not transmit the disease [2]. In the incubation period, the exposed can transmit the disease with a lower incidence than the infected individuals [6, 7]. I is associated with individuals who transmit the disease. R is related to the individuals who were infected and got immunity, permanent [2] or temporary [8]. The composition of these compartments forms the classical epidemics models: Susceptible-Infected (SI) [9], Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) [10], Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) [11], Susceptible-Infected-RecoveredSusceptible (SIRS) [12], Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered (SEIR) [13, 2], and Susceptible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered-Susceptible (SEIRS) [8]. An introduction to these models can be found in Ref. [3]. These models have been used to study the dynamic of many diseases, for example, COVID-19 [14], dengue fever [15], and childhood epidemics (e.g., measles, diphtheria, and chickenpox) [16].\nSome of these diseases have seasonal behaviour, like measles, chickenpox, pertussis, and others [17, 18]. The common characteristic of seasonal diseases is the recurrence of new outbreaks after a period of time. The motivation to\nwork with seasonal models is to predict future outbreaks and propose control measures [19].\nSeasonal models have been introduced since 1928 [20]. They present a rich variety of oscillatory phenomena [21]. London and Yorke [22] considered an epidemic model with seasonally varying contact rates forcing, studied the recurrent outbreaks of measles, chickenpox, and mumps in New York City. Their simulations reproduced the observed pattern in annual outbreaks of chickenpox, mumps and biennial outbreaks of measles and also verified that the mean contact rate is higher in winter than in summer. Considering a SEIR model with seasonal components, Olsen and Schaffer [16] showed, from real data, that measles epidemics are inherently chaotic. Aguiar et al. [23] analysed a seasonally forced SIR epidemic model for dengue fever with temporary cross-immunity and the possibility of secondary infection. Their results showed that the addition of seasonal forcing induces chaotic dynamics, which is related to the decrease in predictability. Similar results in a SIR model were reported by Stollenwerk et al. [24]. He et al. [25] explored a SEIR epidemic model based on the COVID-19 data from Hubei province. With the introduction of seasonality and stochastic infection, the model becomes nonlinear with chaos. In addition to this work, from the analysis of epidemiological data from 14 countries, the work of Jones and Strigul [26] suggested that the COVID-19 spread is chaotic. Bilal et al. [27] studied changes in the bifurcations of the seasonally forced SIR model considering a transmission rate modulated temporally. By analysing the bifurcation diagrams and respective Lyapunov exponents, in the forward and backward directions of the strength of seasonality, their results showed the coexistence between periodic and chaotic attractors, known as bistability dynamics. Bistability in an epidemic model also was reported by Ventura et al. [28]. They considered a model with mobility where the spreading of disease occurs in temporal networks of mobile agents. In their model, they considered the movement of susceptible in the oppositive direction of infected agents. By developing a semi-analytic approach, they showed that the bistability is caused by the spatial emergence of susceptible clustering.\nMany natural processes exhibit multistability, i.e., the asymptotic state evolves to a large number of coexistence attractors for a fixed parameter set [29]. In these systems, the transient for the final attractor depends strongly on the initial condition [30, 31]. The existence of two alternative states is very important to climate science [32], ecology [33], and epidemiology [11, 27, 28]. When the multistability region is bounded by contrasting attractors and an\nabrupt shift between these attractors occurs, the threshold points in which this transition occurs are called tipping points [34].\nTipping points are found in the process of desertification [34], cancer epidemiology [35], Duffing oscillator [36], epidemic models [37, 38, 39], ecological models [40], and others [41]. Mathematically, the tipping points correspond to bifurcations [34], that, in general, have long transient lifetimes [42]. In the ecological sense, long transients were studied by Hastings et al. [43].\nIn seasonal disease spread, an unclear problem is the limit to forecast precision for the outbreak, as observed by Scarpino and Petri [44]. They studied the time series from ten different diseases (for example, dengue, influenza, measles, and mumps) and demonstrated that the predictability decreases when the time series length is increased. Furthermore, their results showed that the forecast horizon varies by different illnesses. From the other works, it is known that unpredictability is associated with the chaotic dynamics [45]. However, only chaotic dynamics do not provide a satisfactory answer to understanding the mechanism behind unpredictability, since the chaotic attractors are predictable until a Lyapunov time in the order to the inverse of the largest Lyapunov exponent.\nOur main goal in this research is to study the mechanism behind the unpredictability in seasonal infectious diseases. In order to that, we consider a SEIR model with temporary immunity and seasonal forcing [46, 47]. Firstly, we show that the basic reproductive rate R0 depends on the seasonality parameters, such as seasonality degree and frequency. In sequence, we consider numerical simulations which exhibit the existence of bistability for all parameters in the model, which is characterised by the coexistence of periodic and chaotic attractors. We verify this dynamical behaviour by bifurcations diagram type hysteresis and the largest Lyapunov exponent. Despite the rich dynamics in all the parameters, we select the inverse of the latent period to study the unpredictability phenomenon. A wide range of this parameter comprises diseases with short (hours) and large (days) latent period. Our results show that the dynamics are sustained over 70% by bistability between chaotic and periodic attractors. This bistability appears in two large ranges. In the first one, the probability of one initial condition evolving to the chaotic attractor is 51%, while in the second range is 63%. Furthermore, these two ranges are delimited, in their crisis points, by periodic and chaotic attractors (without bistability). In this sense, it is possible to interpret these bifurcations as tipping points. In this way, as novelty, we exhibit that the unpredictability in infectious disease spread is associated with bistable dy-\nnamics and exists one tipping point associated with it. Our work is organised as follows: In section 2, we present the model. Section 3 is dedicated for the study of bifurcations and crisis points. In Section 4, we interpret the crisis points as tipping points. Finally, in Section 5, we draw our conclusions."

The R individuals lose immunity after a period time given by 1/\u03b4 and return to S compartmental. The model is given by\ndS dt = bN(t)\u2212 \u00b5S(t)\u2212 \u03b2S(t)I(t) N(t) + \u03b4R(t),\ndE\ndt = \u03b2\nS(t)I(t)\nN(t) \u2212 (\u03b1 + \u00b5)E(t),\ndI dt = \u03b1E(t)\u2212 (\u03b3 + \u00b5)I(t),\ndR\ndt = \u03b3I(t)\u2212 \u00b5R(t)\u2212 \u03b4R(t),\n(1)\nwhere b is the natural birth rate, \u00b5 is the natural death rate, \u03b1 is the rate at which exposed individuals evolve to be infected, \u03b3 is the recovered rate, \u03b4 is the rate at which the recovered individuals return to the susceptible class after losing immunity. The mean latent period is given by 1/\u03b1, the mean infectious period by 1/\u03b3, and the mean time immunity by 1/\u03b4. The force of infection is \u03b2I\nN , where \u03b2 is the effective per capita contact rate of infective\nindividuals and the incidence rate is \u03b2SI N\n. We consider the transmission rate with a seasonal forcing given by\n\u03b2(t) = \u03b20(1 + \u03b21cos\u03c9t), (2)\nwhere \u03b20 is the average contact rate, \u03b21 (0 \u2264 \u03b21 \u2264 1) measures the seasonality degree, and \u03c9 is the frequency [16, 46, 47]. Considering \u00b5 = b, we obtain, from Eq. 1, S + E + I + R = N . Therefore, it is possible, without loss of generality, to rewrite Eq. 1 using the following transformations: s = S/N , e = E/N , i = I/N , r = R/N .\nThe equilibrium solutions of SEIRS model are found by solving the following equations\n0 \u2261 b\u2212 \u00b5s\u2212 \u03b2si+ \u03b4r, 0 \u2261 \u03b2si\u2212 (\u03b1+ \u00b5)e, 0 \u2261 \u03b1e\u2212 (\u03b3 + \u00b5)i, 0 \u2261 \u03b3i\u2212 \u00b5r \u2212 \u03b4r,\n(3)\nwhere the disease-free equilibrium is (s\u2217, e\u2217, i\u2217, r\u2217) = (1, 0, 0, 0), since b = \u00b5. However, a very important equilibrium solution is the endemic solution, which is given by\ns\u2217 = (\u03b1 + \u00b5)(\u03b3 + \u00b5) \u03b2(t)\u03b1 \u2261 1 R0 , e\u2217 = \u03b3 + \u00b5\n\u03b1\n\u00b5+ \u03b4\n\u03b2(t)(\u00b5+ \u03b4)\u2212 R0\u03b4\u03b3 (bR0 \u2212 \u00b5),\ni\u2217 = \u00b5+ \u03b4\n\u03b2(t)(\u00b5+ \u03b4)\u2212 R0\u03b4\u03b3 (bR0 \u2212 \u00b5),\nr\u2217 = 1\u2212 s\u2217 \u2212 e\u2217 \u2212 i\u2217,\n(4)\nwhere R0 is the basic reproductive ratio [48]. We consider \u00b5 = b to obtain a fixed population size. If \u03b4 = 0 and \u00b5 = b, we recover the expression i\u2217 = \u00b5 \u03b2 (R0\u22121) that is the endemic fixed point for the SEIR model, as shown in Ref. [48] without seasonal forcing. In this way, the terms \u03b4, b, \u03b3, \u03b20, and \u03b21 appear as correction terms in the infected individuals. R0 = R0(t) \u221d \u03b20(1+\u03b21cos\u03c9t) is proportional to the seasonal parameters.\nHowever, Eq. 2 makes the system become nonautonomous. To build an autonomous system, we introduce a new variable T = \u03c9t and a new\ndifferential equation, that is given by dT dt\n= \u03c9. With these considerations, the equations become\nds dt = \u00b5\u2212 \u00b5s\u2212 \u03b2(T )si+ \u03b4r, de dt = \u03b2(T )si\u2212 (\u03b1 + \u00b5)e, di dt = \u03b1e\u2212 (\u03b3 + \u00b5)i,\ndT\ndt = \u03c9,\nr = 1\u2212 s\u2212 e\u2212 i,\n(5)\nwhere the differential equation for r is replaced by the constraints. As an example, a solution of Eq. 5 is shown in Fig. 2(a) for all variables. Differently from the standard SEIRS, the seasonal forcing produces oscillations in the epidemic curves in accordance with \u03c9. The exposed and infected curves are amplified in Fig. 2(b), in log scale. This result shows a solution like a forced damped oscillator.\nThe influences of \u03b20, \u03b4, \u03b21, and \u03b3 in the dynamical system are exhibited in Figs. 3(a-d), respectively, by the bifurcation diagrams followed by the largest Lyapunov exponent (\u03bb1) [49]. The Lyapunov exponent is a tool to identify chaos [50]. A positive largest Lyapunov exponent (\u03bb1 > 0) corresponds to chaotic dynamics [51]. The bifurcations are constructed by the collection of the i maxima points in the forward (red) and backward (blue) directions. The combination of distinct bifurcation in forward and backward directions comprises a hysteresis [36]. Also, the Lyapunov exponents are calculated in both directions. By considering these results, it is possible to locate ranges where two attractors coexist, both looking at the bifurcation and Lyapunov exponent. These regions are delimited by the black dotted square in the panels (a-d). The regions where this dynamical behaviour exists are called bistability. Systems with these dynamics are extremely sensitive to the initial state [31] and the presence of chaotic attractor in these systems is rare [30, 52].\nThe result in Fig. 3(a) shows bistability dynamics in the range \u03b20 \u2208 [287, 332] and \u03b20 \u2208 [480, 491]. The bistability comprehends 14% of the \u03b20 range. However, for this parameter set, the dynamics is mostly periodic. The bifurcation for \u03b4 is very similar to the bifurcation for \u03b20, as shown in Fig. 3(b). For this parameter set, the bistability between periodic and chaotic attractor only exists in \u03b4 \u2208 [0.19, 0.22], which comprehends 7.5% of the \u03b4\nrange. Therefore, the time to lose immunity is relevant for the epidemic dynamics. Diseases with long time immunity, for example > 10 years, or short time immunity, as for example < 3 years, have periodic dynamics. Another analised parameter is the seasonality strength \u03b21, as displayed in Fig. 3(c). Our simulations show one region of bistability in \u03b21 \u2208 [0.25, 0.32] (7% of \u03b21 range) and most of the dynamics is sustained by chaotic attractors. Figure 3(d) exhibits the bifurcation as a function of \u03b3, where one region of bistability in \u03b3 \u2208 [108, 123] (19% of the \u03b3 range), however, it is dominated by periodic behaviour. The \u03c9 parameter also is associated with the creation or annihilation of bistability dynamics, for example, for \u03c9 in the range 12 up to 30 months, the bistability is found. For values under 12 months the dynamics is periodic.\nWe observe that the parameters \u03b20, \u03b4, \u03b21, and \u03b3 are relevant to understand the disease spread dynamics. However, we select the \u03b1 parameter as the control parameter, once the bifurcation diagram for this parameter exhibits\nrich dynamic, it is possible to study the crisis and critical points, known as tipping points."

            "text": "The latent period is an important variable in the dynamics of the epidemics [53] and is defined as 1/\u03b1 [3]. To understand the effects of \u03b1 in the dynamical system (Eq. 5), we consider \u03b4 = 0.25, \u03b20 = 270, \u03b21 = 0.28, \u03b3 = 100, and \u00b5 = b = 0.02, where the time unity is year. We choose \u03b1 as the control due to the fact that the bistability and tipping points are more evident.\nFigure 4 displays the bifurcation diagram (considering i maximum) in the panel (a) and the largest Lyapunov exponent (\u03bb1) in the panel (b). Given an initial condition, the red point is the maximum value of i in the forward \u03b1 direction following the attractor, i.e., the initial condition for the current step is equal to the last step. The blue points are obtained in the backward \u03b1 direction. In Fig. 4(a), the vertical lines (Ti) are the critical points that delimit the bifurcation, where i = 1, 2, 3, 4. The bistable chaotic-periodic occupies \u2248 70% of the \u03b1 range, while the coexistence between periodicperiodic \u2248 1%. The ranges [T1, T2] and [T3, T4] encompass the coexistence of \u03bb1 < 0 and \u03bb1 > 0 which confirms the bistability between periodic and chaotic attractors, as illustrated in Fig. 4(b).\nDue to the coexistence of two attractors, we compute two basins of attractions for different \u03b1 values. For \u03b1 = 100 in Figs. 5(a-c) and for \u03b1 = 200 in Figs. 5(d-f). The colour scheme follows the colour of the attractor in Fig. 4. For \u03b1 = 100, 43% of the basin formed by red points that evolve to the chaotic attractor is separately displayed in Fig. 5(b), while 57% of the basin is composed of blue points, which evolve to the periodic attractor as\ndisplayed in Fig. 5(c). The colour scale in Figs. 5(b), 5(c), 5(e) and 5(f) is r0. The composition of the basin attraction is not preserved by \u03b1 translation. However, in other ranges, for example [T3, T4], the shape of the basin attraction changes, as shown in Fig. 5(d), for \u03b1 = 200. For this \u03b1 value, 57% of the points evolve to the chaotic attractor. The basin for the chaotic attractor is shown in Fig. 5(e). The 43% of the remaining points evolve to the periodic attractor and are plotted in Fig. 5(f). The structure of this basin remains in the range [T3, T4]. However, translations in \u03b1 change the composition of the basin attraction, which decrease as a cubic function.\nThe sudden change in the dynamical behaviour occurs at certain values of the control parameter, that are the critical points T1 = 27, T2 = 130.88966, T3 = 161.69990, and T4 = 303.88407. These events are called crises [54, 55] and are defined by the collision between a chaotic and a periodic attractor.\nIn the point T1 occurs a rising of a bistable region by bifurcation. It starts by the existence of two different attractors, that are represented by blue and red branches. The bistability is formed by two periodic attractors until the point in which the red branch becomes chaotic by bifurcation. After that, the dynamics is sustained by the coexistence of periodic (blue) and chaotic (red) attractors until T2.\nThe 3-dimensional and 2-dimensional projections of the attractors merging in [T1, T2] range are displayed in Figs. 6(a) and 6(b), respectively, for \u03b1 = 130. The attractor shape is invariant by \u03b1 \u2208 [T1, T2] translation. The attractors are constructed considering the stroboscopic map, that is a collection of the dynamical variables every T = n\u03c0, where n = 0, 2, 4, .... Figures 6(c) and 6(d) display the 3 and 2-dimensional projections of the chaotic (blue points) and periodic (red points) in the range [T3, T4] for \u03b1 = 161.70276. Figures 6(e) and 6(f) show the projections of the chaotic attractor for \u03b1 > T4. In this regime, only chaotic attractor survives.\nOnce crossed T2, the bistability disappears and periodic behaviour prevails. In this point, the chaotic attractor collides with the periodic one by a saddle-point bifurcation. Around the crisis point, it is expected that the transient time tends to infinity. We calculate the average transient time \u3008\u03c4\u3009 for 200 initial conditions in the interval [T2, 130.89666], as displayed in Fig.\n7 by red points. \u03c4 parameter represents the time to the chaotic attractor dynamics goes to the periodic one. The black curve is a Gaussian fit displayed by the equation\ny = y0 + A\n\u03c3 \u221a\n\u03c0 4 ln(2)\ne\u2212 4 ln(2)(\u3008\u03c4\u3009\u2212\u3008\u03c4\u3009c)\n2\n\u03c32 . (6)\nThe y0, A, \u03c3 are parameters for the fitting. We observe the existence of a transient chaos around T2, that has a distribution type Gaussian centered in \u3008\u03c4\u3009c = 28 \u00d7 104 years. In the range where transient chaos exists, the basin of attraction is composed of chaotic and periodic orbits. However, the initial conditions that evolve to chaotic attractor dissipate linearly and smoothly with the increase of the transient time.\nThe point T3 denotes the birth of a new bistable region. That happens by a transition from a periodic branch (blue) to a chaotic by a saddle point. In this transition also exists a transient chaos, which is displayed in Fig. 8 by the red points. The transient time in the range [T3, 161.70849] follows a binomial distribution, indicate by the continuous black lines y1 and y2, given by the log normal distribution\ny = y0 + A\u221a 2\u03c0\u03c3\u03c4 e\u2212 (ln(\u3008\u03c4\u3009/\u3008\u03c4\u3009c))\n2\n2\u03c32 , (7)\nwhere the first peak value is \u3008\u03c4\u3009 = 1.9 \u00d7 104 years and the second one is \u3008\u03c4\u3009 = 3 \u00d7 104 years. For \u03b1 < T3 and close to T3, there is transient chaos. The basin of attraction for the chaotic attractor is extinct linearly smooth with the increase of the transient.\nAfter crossing T3, we observe a bistable regime that comprehends 40% of the \u03b1 range. The bistability is sustained by the coexistence of periodic and chaotic attractors, as shown in Figs. 6(c) and 6(d). Crossing this bistable regime, we find the last crisis point (T4). The transient time goes to infinity, following a decay \u221d x\u22121/2 as we move away from T4. However, at this point, the transient is periodic. Figure 9 exhibits our result for 200 periodic initial conditions. Differently from the two first cases, the transient goes to infinity for T4 = \u03b1c and decays with (\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1c)\u03b3 , where \u03b3 = \u22120.5025 \u00b1 0.0002 and \u03b1 > \u03b1c, with this standard deviation value we can say that \u03b3 = 1/2 that is the universality exponent for average duration of chaotic transients. The black line indicates the fit curve, that is given by y = 167.06(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b1c)\u22120.5025 with a correlation coefficient equal to \u22120.9999549. After this transient, the periodic points, in the phase space, coalesce in a chaotic attractor by a saddlepoint. The basin of attraction in the crisis point is formed by 19% of the initial conditions that evolve to a periodic attractor. Increasing the transient time until \u03c4 = 50800, we verify an abrupt change and the fraction of periodic points goes to zero, discontinuously. The periodic transient persists until 1% above \u03b1c calculated through (\u03b1\u2212 \u03b1c)/\u03b1c."

            "heading": "4. Tipping points",
            "text": "Tipping points mark changes in the system between alternative states [34]. It occurs when a threshold is crossed due to an external perturbation or by shift in the parameters of the system [56]. The transitions correspond to saddle-node or fold bifurcations [36]. Between two tipping points, the system is bistable, i.e., it can be found in one of two possible states [34].\nIn the seasonal disease context, the desired state is one in which the future outbreak is predictable. If the disease spread is predictable, based on the data from previous years, it is possible to construct more efficient control strategies and, consequently, decrease the number of infected individuals. The undesired state, on the other hand, is when the evolution of the disease spread is unpredictable. The unpredictability is associated with chaotic dynamics [45] and was studied by Scarpino and Petri [44]. However, until the moment, the mechanism behind the unpredictability is not satisfactorily explained by only the chaotic dynamics. In this work, we show that unpredictability is associated with bistable dynamics and has a tipping point.\nFigure 10 exhibits the state variable as a function of the parameter control. We observe a state related to the predictable (green line) and another to the unpredictable (red line). The state variable can be the number of infected and the parameter control can be the \u03b1 variable. With regard to the green curve, the control parameter is increased until tipping point 1. At this point, the system reaches threshold 1. Once crossed, the state variable\nevolves to the red branch, which represents the unpredictable state. If we start in the red branch and decrease the control parameter, then, after crossing threshold 2, the system shifts to the green branch. Therefore, the state system can alternate between unpredictable and predictable due to parameter control. This situation illustrates what happens in points T3 and T4, as shown in Fig. 4.\nte v\nar ia\nb le\nFirstly, we focus on the range [T1, T2] shown in Fig. 4. The system exhibits periodic behaviour for \u03b1 < T1 and \u03b1 > T2. However, it encompasses a bistable chaotic-periodic dynamics in the considered interval. In this region, the maximum number of infected individuals increases by 20 times from T1 to T2, however, in the boundary the attractors are periodic. The bistable region is interesting in terms of predictability, for the reason that small changes in the initial condition can leave the system from periodic to chaotic behaviours. In this region, the average probability of an initial condition evolving to the periodic behaviour is 49%. Therefore, with this measure, the predictability is uncertain in the interval [T1, T2].\nIn the range [T3, T4] are the tipping points illustrated in Fig. 10. Considering T2 < \u03b1 < T3, all the initial conditions evolve to a periodic attractor, namely the dynamics is predictable. For example, based on the date of one year, it is possible to implement restrictions for the next year. Once crossed T3, the dynamic becomes bistable. The range [T3, T4] is connected by the coexistence of chaotic and periodic dynamics. The probability of one initial\ncondition evolving to a periodic attractor is displayed in Fig. 11. The probability distribution for \u03b1 has a cubic decay as closer to T4. The average is equal to 37% and we can affirm that diseases in [T3, T4] are preferably unpredictable. After crossing T4, all the initial conditions evolve to the chaotic attractor and, as a consequence, the disease spread becomes unpredictable."

            "text": "In this work, we study a SEIR seasonal model with temporary immunity. The inclusion of temporary immunity greatly enriches the system dynamics. Our results show that the bistable dynamics depend on the control parameters. Thus, by varying \u03b1, 70% of the range exhibits bistability, which is composed of chaotic and periodic attractors. Our results show the importance of all parameters in the spread dynamics, however, with the crisis present in the \u03b1 bifurcation, it is possible to study tipping points phenomena. We explore a range that includes diseases with a latent period in order of days until hours [53].\nWe verify that the dynamics of the disease spread is chaotic for \u03b1 \u2265 300. The diseases in this range have a latent period less than 1.2 days. Only values\nin 0 < \u03b1 \u2264 30 (very high values of 1/\u03b1 until 12 days) and 130 \u2264 \u03b1 \u2264 161 (2.8 until 2.2 days) are periodic. Values above \u03b1 > 350 are not considered.\nThe analysed range shows that the latent period is a crucial variable to understand the reason for the unpredictability of infectious diseases. This unpredictability was observed by Scarpino and Petri [44], however, the components of the unpredictability were unclear. Our results show that the unpredictability is closely associated with \u03b1 due to bistable dynamics.\nTo finish this work, we answer the question provided in Introduction: the disease spread becomes unpredictable when the tipping point T4 is crossed. Therefore, diseases with a short latent period, less than 30 hours, are always unpredictable.\nAcknnowledgements\nThe authors thank Dr. E.S. Medeiros for discussions.
