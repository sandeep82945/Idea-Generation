    "abstractText": "Cytonuclear coordination between biparental-nuclear genomes and uniparental-cytoplasmic organellar genomes in plants is often resolved by genetic and transcriptional cytonuclear responses. Whether this mechanism also acts in allopolyploid members of other kingdoms is not clear. Additionally, cytonuclear coordination of interleaved allopolyploid cells/individuals within the same population is underexplored. The yeast Saccharomyces pastorianus provides the opportunity to explore cytonuclear coevolution during different growth stages and from novel dimensions. Using S. pastorianus cells from multiple growth stages in the same environment, we show that nuclear mitochondria-targeted genes have undergone both asymmetric gene conversion and growth stage-specific biased expression favoring genes from the mitochondrial genome donor (Saccharomyces eubayanus). Our results suggest that cytonuclear coordination in allopolyploid lager yeast species entails an orchestrated and compensatory genetic and transcriptional evolutionary regulatory shift. The common as well as unique properties of cytonuclear coordination underlying allopolyploidy between unicellular yeasts and higher plants offers novel insights into mechanisms of cytonuclear evolution associated with allopolyploid speciation.",

Polyploidy also is known to have contributed to rapid adaptation and increase species diversity during the evolutionary history of the representative model budding yeast genus Saccharomyces (Selmecki et al. 2015). It is possible to analyze the genetic and transcriptional responses to WGD using autopolyploid (polyploids with multiple chromosome sets derived from a single taxon) or allopolyploid (polyploids with chromosomes derived from two or more diverged taxa) yeasts (Krogerus et al. 2016; Scott et al. 2017).\nLager yeast (Saccharomyces pastorianus) is a well described, naturally evolved allopolyploid species that has been utilized for many centuries for bottom fermentation at low temperatures to produce lager beers (Nakao et al. 2009). Both allotriploid and allotetraploid lager yeasts have been identified (Monerawela and Bond 2018; Salazar et al. 2019). Previous work has suggested that the closest extant relatives of the allopolyploid genome donors to S. pastorianus involve strain(s) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and an Saccharomyces eubayanus strain from Tibet (Libkind et al. 2011; Bing et al. 2014), with the mitochondrial donor being closely related to the Tibetan S. eubayanus strain (Okuno et al. 2016). There is a well-annotated mitochondrial genome of S. eubayanus (Baker et al. 2015), which is about 22 kb smaller (64.0 kb) than the 85.8 kb mitochondrial genome of S. cerevisiae. Together with a recent chromosome-level genome assembly of lager yeast (S. pastorianus CBS 1483; Salazar et al. 2019), this\nMol. Biol. Evol. 39(11):msac228 https://doi.org/10.1093/molbev/msac228 Advance Access publication October 19, 2022 1\nic.oup.com /m be/article/39/11/m sac228/6763671 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nsystem provides the genomic resources necessary for studying mitochondrial genes and identifying subgenomic nuclear homoeologs (genes duplicated via polyploidy) within allopolyploid lager yeasts.\nSimilar to allopolyploid plant species, allopolyploid lager yeasts need to overcome cytonuclear challenges accompanying the merger of nuclear genomes from two species with the organellar genome from only one (Gong et al. 2012, 2014; Barnard-Kubow et al. 2017; Sloan et al. 2018; Li et, al. 2019, 2020; Timouma et al. 2021; Forsythe et al. 2022; Sharbrough et al. 2022). Taking allopolyploid lager yeasts as an example, the combination of divergent S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus nuclear genomes but the inheritance of only S. eubayanus progenitor organellar mitochondrial genome could result in a challenge of coordination between mitochondrial-targeted S. cerevisiae homoeologs and the S. eubayanus mitochondria. Identification of fertility-related mitochondrial genes in the nuclear genome of hybrid (S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus) yeast reflects the importance of mitochondrial\u2013nuclear compatibility in yeast speciation (Lee et al. 2008; Solieri 2010; Leducq et al. 2017). Studies focusing on the rbcS-encoding, chloroplast-targeted small subunits of RuBisCo have characterized cytonuclear processes accompanying allopolyploid evolution in angiosperms (Gong et al. 2012, 2014; Wang et al. 2017). One characterized route reducing potential cytonuclear conflict is intergenomic homogenization of rbcS homoeologs through \u201cpaternal-to-maternal\u201d gene conversions (Gong et al. 2014; Li et al. 2019, 2020; Grover et al. 2022). At the transcriptional level, a second path involves biased expression of rbcS homoeologs in the direction predicted by the organellar origin in the allopolyploids (Gong et al. 2012, 2014; Wang et al. 2017). These and other coordinated cytonuclear responses are thought to stabilize or optimize RuBisCo holoenzyme activity.\nPopulation growth in allotetraploid lager yeasts can be divided into four characteristic stages or phases, namely, lagging, exponential/log, stationary, and death, and are monitored by optical absorbance densities at 600 nm (short OD600). Similar to other microbial populations, Saccharomyces species exhibit unique physical and metabolic states across these different stages or phases (Johnson 1968; Ginovart et al. 2011, 2018; Olivares-Marin et al. 2018). For example, rapid multiplication of cells and consumption of sugar occur in the exponential/log phase, whereas the subsequent stationary phase involves flocculation (the act of yeasts aggregating into \u201cclumps\u201d) and preparation for nutritional constraints (i.e., running out of sugar supply). These characteristic population level features allow us to explore transcriptomic cytonuclear responses that characterize each specific phase. Importantly, allopolyploid yeasts living in the same habitat are interconnected via multiple metabolic and physiological routes, and thus individuals are not really independent (MacLean and Gudelj 2006; Bleoanca et al. 2013; Youk and Lim 2014; Laman Trip and Youk 2020). These interactions integrate the allopolyploid yeast individuals into an\ninterleaved population, representing an interesting model for exploring cytonuclear coordination at the population level in the same habitat.\nIn the present study, we describe genome-wide cytonuclear coevolution for nuclear mitochondria-targeted (hereafter abbreviated as NMT) genes in fungal allopolyploid yeasts. We identified homologous NMT groups in allopolyploid S. pastorianus and models of its diploid genome donors S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus. Based on the finding that the NMT homoeologs in S. pastorianus were under strong purifying selection, we characterized genomic and transcriptional coordination during microaerobic growth stages. Our work shows that cytonuclear evolutionary responses to allopolyploidy in lager yeasts bear similarities to those of plants, comprising both unidirectional homoeologous gene conversions and biased expression for homoeologs of S. eubayanus origin. Our findings provide novel insights into the general and unique features of cytonuclear coevolution in unicellular fungal allopolyploid species."

            "text": "NMT Genes are Under Strong Purifying Selection Pressure Conveyed from Cytoplasmic Mitochondria of Saccharomyces eubayanus Origin Allopolyploid Saccharomyces pastorianus originated through complex hybridization events (allotriploidization and allotetraploidization), involving progenitors similar to modern S. eubayanus and S. cerevisiae. Based on the aligned ORFs of coding genes in mitochondrial DNAs (hereafter mtDNAs), mtDNAs maintained in S. pastorianus were confirmed to be inherited from the S. eubayanus-like parent (Okuno et al. 2016). To increase the resolution of phylogenetic analysis, we compared whole-genomic mtDNA SNPs (in both coding and non-coding regions) in all yeast strains studied to confirm the mitochondrial origin of our S. pastorianus strains. The phylogenetic placement of all S. pastorianus mtDNAs as sister to S. eubayanus confirms that the mitochondrial genomes of all three allopolyploid S. pastorianus strains were indeed contributed by S. eubayanus (supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material online).\nAllopolyploid S. pastorianus exhibits low-temperature tolerance, enabled by its mitochondrial DNA inherited from cryotolerant S. eubayanus (Baker et al. 2015). Accordingly, it is hypothesized that specific mitochondrial genes (mtDNA genes) in both diploid S. eubayanus and allopolyploid S. pastorianus could be under selection for cold tolerance. In addition, considering the importance of NMT genes in mitochondrial activities (Bousquet et al. 1991; Malina et al. 2018), it is reasonable to hypothesize that selection also acts on NMT genes in cryotolerant yeasts as well. To test these hypotheses, we characterized mtDNA genes, non-NMT, and NMT homolog groups in both diploid S. eubayanus and allopolyploid S. pastorianus. Based upon sequence alignments of each gene homolog group, we estimated and compared their ratios of\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m be/article/39/11/m sac228/6763671 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nnonsynonymous to synonymous substitutions (dN/dS ratios) between species at the same and different ploidy levels and even between subgenomes within the same allopolyploid species.\nIn both diploid S. eubayanus and allopolyploid S. pastorianus, all genes except atp8 harbored dN/dS ratios less than 1.0, consistent with purifying selection (fig. 1A; supplementary table S2, Supplementary Material online). atp8 was an outlier with a high dN/dS ratio resulting from its single nonsynonymous substitution. Importantly, the cox1 gene with a lower dN/dS ratio had a specific allele type which was confirmed to confer cryotolerance in Saccharomyces uvarum (Li et al. 2019). For the profiles of NMT and non-NMT genes in the genomes of diploid S. cerevisiae, S. eubayanus, and allopolyploid S. pastorianus strain(s) were characterized by sequence similarity searches against genes in the fungal secretome and subcellular proteome knowledgebase (Meinken et al. 2014) (table 1), in which mitochondria-targeted is well annotated. A total of 1616 (26.90%) NMT and 4392 (73.10%) non-NMT genes were identified in S. cerevisiae, whereas 535 (9.95%) NMT and 4842 (90.05%) non-NMT genes were identified in\nS. eubayanus (table 1). In principle, the differences in the abundance of NMT genes in S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus could reflect differences in qualities of their genome assemblies/annotations and/or to actual evolutionary divergence in NMT gene composition in yeast species or strains. Given the numbers and relative abundances of NMT genes in the two subgenomes C (S. cerevisiae contributed; 871 [23.09%], 1261 [23.04%], and 1365 [23.94%] genes) and E (S. eubayanus contributed; 456 [9.30%], 429 [9.15%], and 465 [9.26%] genes) in multiple S. pastorianus allopolyploid strains (table 1), we infer that the difference is real rather than due to annotation or genome assembly issues. Notably, the significantly higher abundance of NMT genes (or lower abundance of non-NMT genes) in S. cerevisiae than those in both S. eubayanus and the C subgenome of S. pastorianus (Proportion test, P value < 0.01; table 1) and absence of this pattern in S. eubayanus and the E subgenome of S. pastorianus (Proportion test, P value > 0.05; table 1) implicate either amplification in the number of NMT genes in S. cerevisiae or genome-wide loss of genes in S. pastorianus, consistent with their differences in genome size (85.8 vs 68.6 kb).\nFIG. 1. Nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution ratios (dN/dS) of mitochondrial and nuclear genes. (A) dN/dS ratios (y-axis) of homologous mitochondrial genes (mtDNA genes; x-axis) in S. pastorianus and S. eubayanus are summarized; (B) Each panel summarizes the dN/dS ratios of all single-copy NMT and non-NMT genes characterized in diploid orthologs of S. eubayanus and S. cerevisiae and subgenomic homoeologs of allopolyploid S. pastorianus.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m be/article/39/11/m sac228/6763671 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nInterestingly, the number of NMT and non-NMT genes varied across different allopolyploid S. pastorianus strains, with fewer C subgenomic NMT and non-NMT genes in the CBS 1513 strain (871 [23.09%] and 2901 [76.91%], respectively). To minimize potential artifactual (genome assembly/annotation) effects, we grouped single-copy biparental diploid orthologs with their respective subgenomic homoeologous copies (all homologs exist in single-copy status) for each allopolyploid S. pastorianus strain into a homolog group by OrthoFinder (Emms and Kelly 2019). These single-copy, homologous NMT and non-NMT gene groups were input into subsequent evolutionary analyses (table 2).\nWe compared dN/dS ratios for diploid orthologs and their respective C and E subgenomic homoeologs within each NMT and non-NMT gene group as well (fig. 1B; supplementary table S3, Supplementary Material online). Of note, for parental diploid orthologs, the dN/dS ratios of most NMT and non-NMT genes were zero (fig. 1B), implicating a dominant pattern of purification selection. After allopolyploidy, within both NMT and non-NMT gene groups, dN/dS ratios of C subgenomic homoeologs were significantly higher than those of E subgenomic copies (fig. 1B). Intriguingly, for E subgenomic homoeologs, most dN/dS ratios of NMT and non-NMT homoeologs were less than 1.0 while ratios of NMT group were lower than those of the non-NMT group (Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, P value < 0.01); as for C subgenomic homoeologs, most dN/dS ratios of NMT homoeologs were still less than 1.0 while there were more non-NMT homoeologs harboring dN/dS ratios higher than 1.0, which make the former ratios significantly lower than the latter (fig. 1B). These observations indicate that both E and C subgenomic NMT homoeologs in S. pastorianus were still under purifying selection from cytoplasmic mitochondria of S. eubayanus origin whereas selective constraints for E subgenomic NMT homoeologs are higher than for C subgenomic NMT copies.\nSaccharomyces cerevisiae-to-Saccharomyces eubayanus Gene Conversions Among NMT Homoeologs To evaluate possible gene conversion among homoeologs in allopolyploid yeast, we characterized nonsynonymous SNP changes (Materials and Methods; fig. 2A) for single-copy NMT and non-NMT homoeologous (table 2). These changes included conversions in the S. cerevisiae-to-S. eubayanus and S. eubayanus-to-S. cerevisiae directions (S. cerevisiae homoeologous SNPs were converted into S. eubayanus homoeologous SNPs, and vice versa) (supplementary table S5 andS6, Supplementary Material online). We found that the percentages of S. cerevisiae-to-S. eubayanus SNPs were higher in the NMT groups than in the non-NMT groups (binomial test, P value < 0.01; fig. 2B) in all three allopolyploid strains. More intriguingly, a higher degree of gene conversions in the S. cerevisiae-to-S. eubayanus direction occurred in the allotriploid (CBS 1513) than in the allotetraploids (CBS 1483 and WS 34/70; binomial test, P value < 0.01; fig. 2B). A representative case of the NMT gene involving Mrx15 homoeologs (encoding membrane-associated mitoribosome receptor) and its specific S. cerevisiae-to-S. eubayanus and S. eubayanus-to-S. cerevisiae gene conversions are illustrated in supplementary fig. S2a, Supplementary Material online, respectively. Overall, the greater S. cerevisiae-to-S. eubayanus gene conversions than the reciprocal direction in the allopolyploid S. pastorianus were consistent with its mtDNAs being contributed by the S. eubayanus-like progenitor, which implicates cytonuclear coevolution; however, more S. cerevisiae-to-S. eubayanus gene conversions in non-NMT homoeologs could be attributed to some uncharacterized selective constraint rather than cytonuclear coevolution.\nTo determine the extent to which gene conversions occurred in NMT homeologs, we estimated the proportion of nonsynonymous SNPs involved in gene conversions for each NMT homoeolog group, which we defined as \u201cconversion level\u201d (Materials and Methods; fig. 2C). Notably, the majority of NMT homoeologs were found to exhibit nonsynonymous S. cerevisiae-to-S. eubayanus gene conversions (S. cerevisiae-to-S. eubayanus conversion level = 1.00), meaning that all polymorphic amino acids of most S. cerevisiae NMT homoeologs were replaced by S. eubayanus amino acids (fig. 2C). A representative NMT homoeolog group, PUT2, exhibiting complete S. cerevisiae-to-S. eubayanus conversion, is illustrated in supplementary fig. S2b, Supplementary Material online. We note that some NMT homoeologs harbored a lower level of gene conversion or did not have any nonsynonymous S. cerevisiaeto-S. eubayanus conversions (S. cerevisiae-to-S. eubayanus conversion level = 0) (fig. 2C).\nTemporal Transcriptional Expression Preference for Saccharomyces eubayanus NMT Homoeologs in"

As the unicellular allopolyploid yeast enters exponential growth in culture, there are increasing demands for energy and hence mitochondrial activity (Johnson 1968). We hypothesized that NMT homoeologs in S. pastorianus exhibit biased transcriptional responses consistent with selection for metabolic optimization.\nTo test this hypothesis (supplementary fig. S1, Supplementary Material online), we designed a microaerobic growth experiment, in which the S. pastorianus WS 34/ 70 strain was incubated for 84 h in YPD (yeast extract\u2013 peptone\u2013dextrose) medium. Samples of mixed yeast cells were collected at intervals (three replicates at each sampling point from T1 to T37; 111 samples in total) for RNA-sequencing, covering the exponential and stationary phases (Materials and Methods; fig. 3A). The overall expression levels of all allotetraploid gene homoeologs were mostly similar within each growth phase, whereas among-phase expression differences were significantly higher than within-phase differences (ANOVA test, P value < 0.01; supplementary fig. S3, Supplementary Material online). Subgenomic expression of each NMT and non-NMT homoeolog pair (S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus homoeologs) was quantified and compared for the replicates at each sampling point. The proportion of gene pairs displaying biased expression towards the S. eubayanus homoeolog was evaluated for NMT and non-NMT homoeolog pairs (fig. 3B). Of note, the extent of biased expression of S. eubayanus homoeologs in NMT and non-NMT homoeologs were similar throughout the stationary stage (fig. 3B); however, in the exponential growth phase, the number of NMT homoeolog pairs exhibiting biased expression favoring S. eubayanus homoeologs was significantly increased relative to that of non-NMT homoeolog pairs, which remained unchanged (fig. 3B).\nThe increased relative preference for the expression of S. eubayanus NMT homoeologs in the exponential phase\ncould be attributed to the increased expression of S. eubayanus homoeologs and/or decreased expression of S. cerevisiae homoeologs. To investigate this further, we employed a method to categorize NMT homoeologs into clusters (Materials and Methods) (Abu-Jamous and Kelly 2018). The largest cluster (Cluster 0) contained 110 NMT homoeolog pairs that displayed concordant biased expression towards S. eubayanus homoeologs (fig. 3C), with most biased expression reflecting upregulation of S. eubayanus NMT homoeologs (ANOVA test for orthogonal contrasts, P value < 0.01; fig. 3D).\nCompensatory Genetic and Transcriptional Cytonuclear Coordination in Saccharomyces pastorianus and Gene Ontology Categorization The question arises as to whether the observed genetic and transcriptional cytonuclear responses of NMT genes in S. pastorianus are independent, collaborative, or compensatory. Briefly, if genetic and transcriptional cytonuclear coevolution are independent, those responsive genes are supposed to occupy most proportion of all cytonuclear coordinative genes and be non-overlapping; if they are collaborative, there should be many common genes making both genetic and transcriptional cytonuclear co-evolutionary responses; if they are compensatory, those cytonuclear responsive genes are expected to be mutually exclusive.\nTo address the foregoing question, we examined the overall mutual exclusion/inclusion status of NMT genes exhibiting genetic and/or transcriptional cytonuclear responses (fig. 4), via categorizing the NMT homoeolog pairs (fig. 2C) into two groups according to having either high or low levels of S. cerevisiae-to-S. eubayanus gene conversions (\u201chigh\u201d and \u201clow\u201d; fig. 4A). We also quantified expression bias toward S. eubayanus homoeologs at both exponential and stationary stages (fig. 4A). Of note, the low NMT\nFIG. 2.

These results indicate that the high conversion NMT genes with significant signals of gene conversion were involved in specialized mitochondrial function, concordant with cytonuclear coevolution.\nTo further support foregoing analysis, we determined the genetic cytonuclear status of the transcriptionresponsive NMT genes. Notably, most NMT genes with enhanced expression bias toward S. eubayanus homoeologs in Cluster 0 harbored fewer genes with complete\nnonsynonymous S. cerevisiae-to-S. eubayanus conversions (S. cerevisiae-to-S. eubayanus conversion level = 1.00; fig. 4C) than did other NMT genes. Altogether, from both viewpoints, genetic and transcriptional cytonuclear joint responses were mutually compensatory to some extent."

As for the first challenge, loss of chromosomes and gene homoeologs and combination of subgenomic genes into one homoeolog have been characterized extensively in both plant and yeast allopolyploids (Birchler and Veitia 2012; Monerawela et al. 2015; Monerawela and Bond 2018; Salazar et al. 2019; Timouma et al. 2021; Grover et al. 2022; Birchler and Yang 2022).

Nevertheless, it is still unclear to what extent optimal cytonuclear reconfigurations entail changes at genetic or transcriptional levels. To broaden our understanding of cytonuclear evolutionary processes accompanying allopolyploidy across the tree of life, the present study was conducted using the allopolyploid lager yeast S. pastorianus, which also allowed us to characterize cytonuclear coordination of interleaved allopolyploid yeast cells within the same population. Our findings provide novel insights into the general and unique features of cytonuclear coevolution in unicellular fungal allopolyploid species.\nGene Conversion in Nuclear Mitochondria-Targeted Genes Mitochondria play central metabolic roles in yeast as in all aerobic organisms, but in yeast this has an economical vital\nfunction in fermentation (Kitagaki and Takagi 2014; Malina et al. 2018). The lager yeast S. pastorianus is known to have acquired cold tolerance (cryotolerance) from S. eubayanus, and hence retains its mitotype (mitochondrial DNA sequences) (Baker et al. 2015). Accordingly, S. eubayanus-contributed mitochondria may have been the target for natural selection in allopolyploid lager yeast favoring cytonuclear or mitonuclear interactions or function. Given the close intracellular communications between the eukaryotic nucleus and cytoplasmic organelles (Storz 2006; Quir\u00f3s et al. 2016; Guaragnella et al. 2018; Malina et al. 2018), it is conceivable that selection on mtDNA also entails corresponding nuclear genomic responses. Although empirical studies have documented the occurrence of post-homoploid hybridization (hybrid at the same ploidy level) in the diploid yeast nuclear genome (Lee et al. 2008; Paliwal et al. 2014; Hsu and Chou 2017; Jhuang et al. 2017; Baker et al. 2015; Nguyen et al. 2020; Bendixsen et al. 2021), this aspect remains unexplored in allopolyploid yeast.\nFIG. 4. Compensatory cytonuclear coordination between genetic and transcriptional responses in S. pastorianus strain WS 34/70. (A) Dynamic transcriptional expression bias for S. eubayanus homoeologs with high and low gene conversion levels (abbreviated as high and low at each sampling point in the growth process.

Specifically, some specific mtDNA genes, including cox1, functioning in cellular respiration and mediating cryotolerance in other yeast relatives (Li et al. 2019), appear to have been under stronger purifying selection than other mtDNA genes (fig. 1A). We draw attention to the signals of selection were detected in NMT genes (fig. 1B) encoding proteins involved in mitochondrial activities. Moreover, the preferential occurrence of S. cerevisiae-to-S. eubayanus conversions in NMT homoeologs, favoring the direction of the mitochondrial genome donor, may reflect selection for optimization of function for interacting proteins encoded by mitochondrial and nuclear genes (fig. 2B). Specific gene homoeologs involved in the mitochondrial oxidation\u2013reduction process (e.g. PUT2), exhibited complete or a high level of S. cerevisiae-to-S. eubayanus gene conversion, which we propose reflects optimization of cytonuclear function in oxidation/reduction in S. pastorianus (figs. 2C,4B, and supplementary fig. S2b, Supplementary Material online).\nFurther evidence is required to confirm a functional and hence possibly adaptive role for the genetic changes we report here for allopolyploid lager yeast. Taking potential participation in cryotolerance as an example, one might reverse specific S. cerevisiae-to-S. eubayanus changes by genetic engineering to study possible attenuation or abrogation of cold tolerance. In addition, it would be intriguing to elucidate the pace at which these types of evolutionary changes arise. For example, one might synthesize fast-cycling synthetic allopolyploid yeasts by mating diploid vegetative cells (Sipiczki 2008; Turgeon et al. 2021) and monitor genetic changes across generations.\nTemporal Dynamics of Gene Expression and Possible Connections to Cytonuclear Function In addition to gene conversions, duplicated genes could undergo transcriptional sub-functionalization via biased usage or expression of specific homoeologous copy (Hu et al. 2020; Nieto Feliner et al. 2020; Birchler and Yang 2022). Lager yeast cells propagated during different growth stages allows investigation of the temporal dynamics of transcriptional sub-functionalization and how it relates to possible cytonuclear selection. Here, we showed that: 1) in the early exponential growth stage, biased expression of S. eubayanus homoeologs for NMT genes was highest (fig. 3B) (Mishra and Chan 2014). The absence of these dynamics for non-NMT genes suggests a possible optimization for NMT genes during this vigorous propagation stage; 2) upon reaching the stationary phase, relatively high biased expression toward S. eubayanus NMT genes is maintained (fig. 3B), perhaps indicating a continued optimization of cytonuclear expression levels even under conditions of limited nutrition and mitotic energetic demand (Leitao and Kellogg 2017; Laman Trip and Youk 2020). Altogether, our data suggest that temporal dynamic transcriptional cytonuclear coordination could play an\nimportant fine-tuning role in the growth and propagation of allopolyploid lager yeasts. In addition, the findings of the present study suggest that allopolyploid yeasts commonly grow in an interactive and communicative manner in the same habitat, indicating that we should consider cytonuclear coordination in allopolyploids from a consolidated spatial and temporal perspective. For example, further analyses of allopolyploid lager yeasts growing in cold temperature and sampled in similar multiple growth stages will allow us to characterize the contribution of transcriptomic cytonuclear coevolution in adaptation to cold tolerance.\nGenetic and Transcriptional Cytonuclear Coordination Mechanisms in Fungi and Plants Genetic and transcriptional changes represent two different evolutionary responses that might result from selection for cytonuclear functional optimization following allopolyploidy. Conceivably, complete or high-level gene conversion (S. cerevisiae-to-S. eubayanus) of most NMT homoeologs (fig. 2C) became fixed early in the hybridization and/or polyploidization process, through directional selection to optimize cytonuclear function (e.g., for cryotolerance in low-temperature fermentation and/or growth habitat). As for NMT homoeologs exhibiting lower or no cytonuclear gene conversions, it is possible that this reflects either insufficient evolutionary time since the formation of the S. pastorianus strains, and/or the acquisition of physiological optimization via transcriptional cytonuclear responses during growth via differential transcriptional regulation of homoeologs (Johannesen and Hansen 2002; Sood et al. 2017; Hovhannisyan et al. 2020). Our findings implicate orchestrated compensatory genetic and transcriptional mechanisms to resolve cytonuclear conflict or optimize cytonuclear function.\nIn principle, transcriptional changes might be hypothesized to arise more quickly than genetic changes, with the latter relying on a presumably slower fixation process of favorable genome-wide mutations, whereas the former may be impacted by relatively fewer mutations in regulatory networks that might affect many genes simultaneously. In the present instance, it would be interesting to study newly synthesized allopolyploid yeasts, to determine the pace and evolutionary dynamics of expression-level changes vs. gene conversion over the generations.\nAs noted above, both gene conversions (in paternal-to-maternal direction) of organelle-targeted nuclear genes and biased expression for maternal homoeologs appear to be common cytonuclear responses following angiosperm allopolyploid speciation (Gong et al. 2014; Li et al. 2019, 2020). It will be interesting to explore the extent to which there are \u201crules\u201d or commonalities in cytonuclear responses in allopolyploid yeasts of different ploidy levels. As the present study is the first to examine cytonuclear evolution following allopolyploidy in yeasts, it is an open question whether our findings will apply to other fungal systems, and hence how the cytonuclear evolutionary process differs or is\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m be/article/39/11/m sac228/6763671 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nthe same in angiosperms and fungi. We note that one aspect of our results, namely, the largely compensatory relationship between transcriptional vs. genetic alteration, has not been observed at a genome-wide scale in plant allopolyploids. It may be that this will indeed be revealed with further study, or alternatively, it is also possible that these two mechanisms often work in concert in higher plants, as exemplified by rbcS in some plant polyploids (Gong et al. 2012, 2014).\nA final comment concerns the overall higher degree of S. cerevisiae-to-S. eubayanus gene conversion in allotriploid than allotetraploid yeast (fig. 2B). Perhaps this reflects the imbalance in ratios of S. eubayanus (mitochondrial donor) origin (1:2 and 1:1 ratios of S. cerevisiae vs. S. eubayanus homoeologous chromosomes in allotriploid and allotetraploid lager yeast, respectively), thus facilitating more frequent conversions using the extra homoeologs. Because there are plant analogs to this fungal set-up, involving unbalanced hexaploids, for example, formed via doubling of interspecific triploid intermediates, one wonders whether gene conversion will be similarly more strongly biased in these types of allopolyploid plants as they are in this single fungal system. Again, further study of multiple evolutionary systems is needed if we are to develop a general understanding of cytonuclear coevolution in polyploid eukaryotes."

            "text": "Yeasts and Culture Medium Saccharomyces pastorianus strain Weihenstephan 34/70 was obtained from China General Microbiological Culture Collection Center. The yeast was cultured in the YPD medium (w/v, 1% yeast extract, 2% peptone, and 2% D-glucose) supplemented with 100 \u03bcg/mL chloramphenicol.\nData Collection The reference genomes of model S. cerevisiae, S. eubayanus, and S. pastorianus strains and re-sequencing data were downloaded from National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). Strain names and respective accession numbers are tabulated in supplementary table S1, Supplementary Material online.\nGenome Update and de Novo Gene Annotations Whole-genome re-sequencing raw reads of S. eubayanus strain CDFM21L.1 were converted from SRA to FASTQ file format using the fastq-dump command provided by the SRA Toolkit (v2.8.0) with default filter settings (Leinonen et al. 2011). Fastp (v0.20.1) was used to filter the low-quality raw sequencing reads (Chen et al. 2018). Sambamba (v0.7.1) was used to remove PCR duplication (Tarasov et al. 2015). Clean paired reads were mapped to the reference genome (FM1318; Baker et al. 2015) using Bowtie2 (v2.4.2) with default settings (Langmead and Salzberg 2012). These data analysis pipeline were used for the other two diploid strains, S. cerevisiae stout strain NCYC 1063 and S. cerevisiae ale strain FostersO (using S288c as the reference genome; Cherry et al. 1997).\nUpdates for the genome assembly and annotation of our three diploid strains were obtained using RGAAT (v2.0) (Liu et al. 2018). Concerning gene annotations for S. pastorianus strains WS 34/70 and CBS 1513, we employed the online tool (WebAUGUSTUS, http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/ webaugustus/; default parameters) (Stanke et al. 2006) to conduct de novo gene annotation using a training gene set from S. pastorianus CBS 1483 strain (Salazar et al. 2019). BUSCO (v4.1.4) was used to evaluate the completeness of genome assembly and the quality of annotations (supplementary fig. S4, Supplementary Material online) (Sim\u00e3o et al. 2015).\nMitochondrial genomes of S. pastorianus strains of CBS 1513 and WS 34/70 were de novo assembled using GetOrganelle toolkit (v1.7.5) (Jin et al. 2020). Mitochondrial genes (mtDNA genes) of S. pastorianus and S. eubayanus were predicted by the MITOS2 (v2.0.8) pipeline based on the NCBI RefSeq 89 Fungi database and using the yeast genetic code (Bernt et al. 2013).\nConstruction of Mitochondrial Phylogenetic Tree To minimize the effect of AT-enrichment and long presence/absence in sequence alignment of whole-genomic mitochondrial DNAs (mtDNAs), mtDNAs of each strain were aligned with S. cerevisiae S288c mtDNA using Snippy (v4.6.0) in contig mode, in which core sites (genomic positions commonly shared in all strains) enclosing monomorphic nucleotide and polymorphic core SNPs will ignore the complications of long presence/absence sequences variant types and possible recombination which are frequently observed in introns and AT/GC clusters. Additionally, its contig mode also discards AT-enriched repeat regions by only maintaining regions covered by uniquely mapping reads (Seemann. T 2015). The multiple alignments were generated using MAFFT (v7.475) (Katoh and Standley 2013). A phylogenetic tree using the Neighbor-Joining method was obtained with MEGA-CC (v11) (Kumar et al. 2012), and visualized using iTOL (https://itol.embl.de/).\nPrediction of Nuclear Mitochondria-Targeted Genes Sequences of nuclear genes encoding S. cerevisiae proteins targeted to subcellular structures of mitochondria (mitochondrial membrane and nonmembrane) were downloaded from the fungal secretome and subcellular proteome knowledgebase (FunSecKB2, http://proteomics. ysu.edu/secretomes/fungi2/index.php) (Meinken et al. 2014). Proteins encoded by NMT genes of all yeasts in this study were identified by BLASTP (v2.6.0) against the downloaded mitochondrial subcellular protein database with similarity greater than 90%, length greater than 65%, and e-value cutoff at 10\u221212(Camacho et al. 2009).\nCalculation of the Nonsynonymous to Synonymous Substitution Ratios (dN/dS) To assign the genes of S. pastorianus into homoeologous subgenomes (C and E), we used OrthoFinder (v2.5.2)\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m be/article/39/11/m sac228/6763671 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\n(default settings) (Emms and Kelly 2019) with BLASTP (v2.6.0) to compare the similarity of amino acid sequences of S. pastorianus genes with their two parental diploid genes. Single-copy orthogroups were identified for all yeast strains with default parameters. A single-copy orthogroup involving at least one NMT gene in a certain yeast strain was identified as a single-copy NMT group. Amino acid sequences and CDSs from the same single-copy NMT orthogroup were aligned using ParaAT (v2.0) (Zhang et al. 2012). The dN/dS ratio of each aligned single-copy NMT orthogroup was calculated by KaKs_Calculator package (v2.0) (Wang et al. 2010). Single-copy NMT and non-NMT orthogroups identified in S. cerevisiae (S288c, NCYC 1063, and FostersO strains), S. eubayanus (FM1318 and CDFM21L.1 strains), and S. pastorianus (CBS 1513, WS 34/70, and CBS 1483 strains) were input into above procedure to calculate respective dN/dS ratio in each diploid genome and allopolyploid subgenomes (supplementary table S3, Supplementary Material online). This method was also used for the calculation of dN/dS ratios for aligned mitochondrial genes (mtDNA genes) of S. eubayanus and S. pastorianus.\nIdentification of Nonsynonymous Homoeologous Gene Conversions Based on Homologous Gene Quartets Subgenomic single-copy homoeologs in each allopolyploid yeast strain were aligned with their respective parental diploid orthologs identified in the same orthogroup using MAFFT (v7.475) (Katoh and Standley 2013). Single-copy gene quartets with C and E homoeologs and orthologs of S. cerevisiae and S. eubayanus were generated.\nCriteria for defining nonsynonymous gene conversions among homoeologs are described below corresponding to labels 1-8 in fig. 2A: site 1 denotes S. eubayanus-to-S. cerevisiae amino acid conversion; site 2 indicates S. cerevisiae-to-S. eubayanus amino acid conversion; site 3 denotes a gap in the alignment that is not considered in conversion analysis; sites 4 and 5 denote the specific nucleotide changes involved in nonsynonymous S. eubayanus-to-S. cerevisiae gene conversion; site 6 indicates an automorphic nucleotide mutation occurring in an E homoeolog; site 7 denotes a synonymous substitution occurring in the E homoeolog; site 8 is a specific nucleotide change involved in S. cerevisiae-to-S. eubayanus gene conversion.\nCalculation of Gene Conversion Level Conversion level represents the proportion of S. cerevisiae-to-S. eubayanus nonsynonymous substitutions occupied in the total number of nonsynonymous substitutions in a given single-copy orthogroup, calculated as follows:\nConversion Level = (number of \u201cS. cerevisiae-to-S. eubayanus\u201d nonsynonymous substitutions)/(sum of all nonsynonymous substitutions). Orthogroups with conversion levels not less than 0.95 were defined as having the high\nconversion level, while others with conversion levels equal to or less than 0.05 were defined as the low conversion.\nMicroaerobic Growth Experiments A suitable amount of S. pastorianus strain WS 34/70 glycerin mixture was initially drawn from a cryopreserved tube and added to 50 mL YPD liquid medium, and grown overnight in a 28\u00b0C shaker at 180 rpm to activate the strain. The cultures were evenly streaked on YPD agar plates, which were incubated upside down at 28\u00b0C until colonies appeared. Three colonies were selected as biological replications and inoculated in 30 mL YPD liquid medium, respectively. We cultured the strains overnight in a 28\u00b0C shaker with 180 rpm. For each biological replication, the yeast strain was inoculated in 37 conical flasks containing 30 mL YPD liquid medium at 1000:1 ratio. 111 conical flasks were cultured at 28\u00b0C with shaking at 180 rpm for 84 h. The cultures were sampled for OD600 measurements and RNA extraction at the following time points: every 1.5 h before 27 h, and every 3 h after 27 h. Three conical flasks were taken out as sample replications each time. Each sample was centrifuged at 5000 \u00d7 g for 1 min at room temperature until 0.3 g yeast cells was collected in 1.5 mL microcentrifuge tube. Accordingly, yeasts were sampled at 37 time points in total for each replicate (supplementary table S4, Supplementary Material online).\nRNA Extraction and Transcriptomic Sequencing For each biological replicate, 500 \u03bcL TriPure Isolation Reagent (Roche Diagnostics GmbH, Mannheim, Germany) and 0.3 g acid-washed glass beads (SIGMA, USA) rapidly were added. After vibrating on the vortex oscillator at the maximum speed for 1 min, samples were put into liquid nitrogen for rapid freezing. This freezing and thawing vibration was repeated five times. After complete melting, the tube was incubated on ice for 5 min to lyse the yeast cells. The total RNA was purified using UNlQ-10 Column Trizol Total RNA Isolation Kit (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China).\nRNA was treated by DNase I and purified using the RNA clean Kit (Qiagen, Germany). High-quality RNA was used for the subsequent library constructions. Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) was removed by Epicentre Ribo-zeroTM rRNA Removal Kit (Epicentre, USA), and rRNA free residue was cleaned up by ethanol precipitation. Strand-specific sequencing libraries were constructed by the NEBNext Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, USA). The resulting library was sequenced on the Illumina Nova 6000 platform in PE150 bp mode at the Novogene Company (Beijing, China).\nDifferentially Expressed Genes Analysis Fastp (v0.20.1) was used to filter the low-quality raw sequencing reads (Chen et al. 2018). The reads from ribosome RNA were removed using Bowtie2 (v2.4.2) (Langmead and Salzberg 2012) based on SILVA (https:// www.arb-silva.de/) (Quast et al. 2012) and Pfam (Mistry\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m be/article/39/11/m sac228/6763671 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\net al. 2021). Clean reads were mapped to the S. pastorianus strain WS 34/70 reference genome (Okuno et al. 2016) using HISAT2 (v2.2.1) (Kim et al. 2019). The reads counts of each sample were quantified by featureCounts (v2.0.1) with the parameters set as \u201c-p -s 2\u201d (Liao et al. 2014). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in two subgenomes (S. eubayanus homoeologs as the numerator and S. cerevisiae homoeologs as the denominator) were identified using DESeq2 (v1.30.1) based on false discovery rate adjusted P value < 0.05. Clust (v1.12.0) was employed to cluster the subgenomic DEGs in terms of their similarity in expression pattern in the temporal course of the lag and exponential phases (T1 to T17) (Abu-Jamous and Kelly 2018).\nGene Ontology Analysis GO term enrichment analysis was performed using the compareCluster command provided by the R package clusterProfiler (v3.18.1). All genes of S. pastorianus strain WS 34/70 were used as the reference background.\nCalculation of Transcriptional Expression Bias for Saccharomyces eubayanus Homoeologs The proportion of highly expressed S. eubayanus homoeologs was calculated as follows:\nTranscriptional expression preference for S. eubayanus NMT homoeologs = (Number of groups with significantly higher expression in S. eubayanus homoeologs)/(Sum of total DEGs groups)."
