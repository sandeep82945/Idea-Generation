 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Install a denser seismic array with larger aperture to better characterize seismic signals below 1 Hz and tremor signals coming from the hydrothermal system. This could provide more insight into the dynamics of the degassing process.

2. Add more meteorological sensors near the seismic stations to better correlate seismic noise with weather parameters like rainfall, wind, etc. This could help differentiate natural vs anthropogenic noise sources. 

3. Conduct controlled CO2 release experiments and monitor seismic response to directly quantify the relationship between degassing rates and seismic signals.

4. Deploy tiltmeters or other deformation sensors to look for ground deformation signals correlated with seismicity and degassing. This could reveal subsurface processes. 

5. Conduct seismic tomography or other geophysical imaging to map subsurface structures and fluid pathways in 3D. This could identify key conduits for degassing and targets for future monitoring.
