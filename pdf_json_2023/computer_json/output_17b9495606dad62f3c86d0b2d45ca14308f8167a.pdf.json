    "abstractText": "Mobile game metrics have received attention since the emergence of big data technology and data-based decision-making. Among different metrics, the monthly active user number is usually significant because it shows the level of players\u2019 engagement and the profit of this game as a business. Therefore, the monthly active user number is valuable for researchers, analysts, and decision-makers interested in the mobile game industry. However, the actual monthly active user number data typically have the accuracy, accessibility, granularity, and cost problems. Therefore, a proxy to the monthly active user number would be helpful to facilitate the decision-making process. This paper proposes to capture user activity through the searches on the Internet from an information-seeking perspective. And the online search volume, wiki page view, social media posts and views are proposed as potential proxies. This paper proposes that the online search volume is an acceptable proxy for the monthly active user number in the context of Geo Augmented Reality (AR) mobile games through data analysis.",

Multiple metrics have been proposed in the current era of data-driven decision-making and are commonly used in practice. These metrics are\n* Hugh Xuechen Liu hugh.liu@my.cityu.edu.hk\nChristian Wagner c.wagner@cityu.edu.hk\n1 School of Creative Media, City University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, SAR, China\ntypically interpreted by academic researchers, business analysts or game designers and used to guide the game design or profit strategy [34]. For other decision-makers in the mobile game industry, the metrics are also crucial for them to grasp the current situation of the games and possibly, participate in the value co-create process [3, 17, 24]. The monthly active user number (MAU) usually receives more attention among varied metrics. It grasps the level of players\u2019 engagement with the game and plays a vital role in reflecting the level of profits of this game [16, 64].\nTypical channels to get the data include game developers, business intelligence companies, direct sampling and direct observation. However, each channel has some advantages and disadvantages. Game developers, who usually have the accurate number of their games\u2019 MAU, see these data as their business secrets and are unwilling to share them with others. If they are willing to share it with others, they may only share static and aggregated data. The data granularity is therefore given and rigid. They may also charge a lot for the data. Business intelligence companies routinely publish industrial reports that possibly include interest data. But similarly, these data are static and aggregated. The customized service is supported but may cost much money. The MAU data may be collected through direct sampling, especially on crowdsourcing platforms. There the data of favorable granularity may be attained at a reasonable price. But the data would depend heavily on the sampling method and the demographic structure of the samples. Lastly, the MAU data can be estimated through direct observations in the game. But that would cost a lot of time and money.\nAll these typical channels of MAU data have drawbacks and somehow hinder the usage of the MAU data in decision-making. Therefore, this paper would like to propose a proxy for the game\u2019s MAU. This proxy should be accessible to the decision-makers, provide flexible data granularly, cost little and convey the core messages in the MAU data. From the informationseeking perspective, this paper proposes that the user activity in a game can be captured by the information-seeking around the game on the Internet, especially the queries and searches on the Internet. Four potential proxies are proposed: online search volume, wiki views, and social media posts and views counts. This paper tests the validity of these four proxies in the context of Geo AR mobile games through a correlation analysis using the data of two games.\nThe following sections are organized in this way. Section 2 provides the background information of the MAU as a mobile game metric and Geo AR mobile games. Then, from the perspective of information seeking, the proxies and their hypothesis are proposed. Section 3 demonstrates the methods of data collection and analysis. Section 4 shows the results, especially the correlation coefficient between the actual MAU and the proxies. Section 5 reports the discussions based on the results. Finally, Section 6 includes the conclusion of this paper."

            "text": "With the development of online gaming and big data technologies in the mobile game industry, game devices can send information across a network. Metrics, namely particular bits of data that client software reports back to the server, indicate game players\u2019 dynamic behavior with the game. It\u2019s understandable why it has become more critical for game companies since the evolving players\u2019 tastes demand the variety and quality of marketplace offerings to expand.\nTo meet players\u2019 expectations and survive in the market competitions, the game developers have their business intelligence unit interpret the metrics collected, modify their game or adjust the business strategy accordingly, issue patches or updates to the game, and see players\u2019 responses. This current situation has forced game developers to stop thinking of their games as ever truly finished. Therefore, it becomes more and more important to continuously monitor players\u2019 engagement and the business performance of a mobile game. These data would be necessary for the data-driven decision-making process related to the game design and marketing strategy [56, 62].\nSo far, diverse metrics have been proposed to capture game players\u2019 dynamic behaviors with the game. Generally, these metrics directly measure the player population, monetization and online advertising. Table 1 below lists player population metrics frequently used in mobile game analysis and their definitions [16, 19, 34]. These metrics stand out because they can be used in almost all games. Even if a game has not been monetized yet, many users can be plausible. A large user base is a foundation for monetization and online advertisement in the future. Among the three metrics of the player population, the monthly active user numbers (MAU) are the most frequently used metric. On the one hand, it captured the whole level of players\u2019 engagement rather than the peaks and a month is also relatively more extended and more stable than a day. That means MAU captures the players\u2019 engagement more reliably and comprehensively. On the other hand, MAU can estimate other metrics such as revenues of a game. Whether one mobile adopts a freemium or premium business model, knowing the situation of the player\u2019s population is always helpful for the decision-making around the game. That means MAU lies in the center of the mobile game metrics. Therefore, the data of MAU is crucial for data-driven mobile game decision-makers.\nAs common practices, there are three typical approaches to getting the MAU data of a game and the data provided by each way has each\u2019s characteristics. Table 2 below summarizes the three typical approaches to collecting the MAU data of a game and the characteristics of the data.\nThe first way is to ask the game developers to provide data. In the mobile game software engineering process, instrumentation means game developers put functions into a piece of software to collect and report back metrics to their business intelligence department. It is technically possible and will be implemented as long as the game developers realize the importance of the metrics. A game company may arbitrarily determine the criteria of an \u201cactive player.\u201d For example, the company may treat a game account, a device, or a play session as a\nTa bl e 2\nT hr ee\nap pr oa ch es\nto ob ta in\nM A U\nda ta\nA pp ro ac he s\nE xa m pl es\nA cc ur ac y\nA cc es si bi lit y\nG ra nu la ri ty\nC os t\nE nq ui re\nga m e de ve lo pe rs\nO pe n ac ce ss\nre vi ew\ns an d fi na nc ia l\nre po rt s\nPo ss ib ly\nth e m os t\nac cu ra te\nU su al ly in ac ce ss ib le be ca us e th ey\nar e\nse en\nas bu si ne ss\nse cr et s;\nD et er m in ed\nby th e de ve lo pe rs\nC an\nbe th e hi gh es t w ith\nlit tle ag gr eg at io n; U su al ly qu ar te rl y da ta ; de te rm in ed by th e de ve lo pe rs\nFr om\nfr ee to ex pe ns iv e, de te rm in ed\nby th e\nde ve lo pe rs\nD ir ec tly\nC ol le ct\nD ir ec t sa m pl in g on\nga m e fo ru m s\n(e .g ., R ed di t) or\ncr ow\nds ou rc in g\npl at fo rm\ns (e .g ., M Tu\nrk )\nM ed ia te ac cu ra cy ; m ay ha ve re pr es en ta tiv\nen es s\npr ob le m\nO pe n ac ce ss\nC an\nbe th e hi gh es t w ith\nlit tle\nag gr eg at io n;\nde te rm\nin ed\nby th e\nin ve st ig at or\nM ay\nco st m on ey\nan d\ntim e\nD ir ec t ob se rv at io n\nL ow\nac cu ra cy\nO pe n ac ce ss\nC an\nbe th e hi gh es t w ith\nlit tle\nag gr eg at io n\nC os tl itt le m on ey ,b ut a lo t of tim e\nC on su lt\nbu si ne ss in te lli ge nc e co m pa ni es\nO pe n ac ce ss\nre po rt\nH ig h ac cu ra cy\nO pe n ac ce ss\nC an\nbe lo w\nor hi gh ; U su al ly\nan nu al\nda ta ; de te rm\nin ed\nby th e co m pa ni es\nFr ee\nC us to m iz ed\nse rv ic es\nH ig h ac cu ra cy\nFo r pa id\ncu st om\ner s\nC an\nbe lo w or\nhi gh ;d et er m in ed\nby th e\ncu st om\ner an d th e co m pa ny\nM ay\nco st m on ey\nan d\ntim e\nplayer. A player may be seen active if the game account is logged in or a play session was started. Drachen, et al. [16] correctly criticized that MAU has been controversial because of the unclear criteria to qualify a user as a \u201cmonthly user.\u201d The specific behavioral definition of \u201cengagement\u201d is also worried. Nevertheless, the game developers have a definition in their mind and use the resulted MAU as a metric.\nThe MAU data collected by the game developers through instrumentation is usually the most accurate. The data granularity is typically high, which means one can know the exact MAU of each month. However, the MAU data from game developers is usually inaccessible because it\u2019s seen as a business secret. For example, in a Q&A session of the game Ingress, the development team directly refused the inquiry of the game\u2019s MAU [31]. Even if developers are willing to share the data, they won\u2019t give the data with the highest granularity but aggregated ones, like the MAU of a quarter or a year. Requests to access the MAU data from game developers may demand long-time negotiations. The data may be given free or charged high. Therefore, the costs of the MAU data from game developers can vary greatly and are determined by the game developers. In the previous studies, Ljepava, et al. [45] used the FacebookMAU data in reports given by the company. Lien and Cao [42] referred to Tencent\u2019s annual announcement report for the MAU data of WeChat.\nThe second way is to collect data on one\u2019s own. For example, it is possible to launch a poll and send questionnaires on the game forums (e.g., Reddit) or crowdsourcing platforms (e.g., MTurk). It is also possible to play the game and see the user\u2019s activity in the game. Although highly accessible and provide high data granularity, these approaches cost a lot of time or money. They may have representativeness problems as well. The quality of data heavily depends on the technique of sampling and research design. This approach is relatively straightforward and feasible. Although this approach can provide intelligence for practical uses, it\u2019s not often utilized in academic contexts.\nThe third way is to consult the business intelligence companies. Some examples are App Annie, SensorTower and Statista. These companies provide reports on mobile game metrics open to the public and paid customized services [48]. In open-access reports, the data is usually a vague estimation and aggregated depending on the data collection technique. However, these open-access reports are widely accepted in the literature (for example, Al-Haija, et al. [1] used the reports of Statista to get the monthly active user of Facebook and Twitter). The data in the report may not be precisely what the decision-makers care about. Customized services may make data with higher accuracy and higher granularity attainable. But it is usually expensive and time-costing.\nIt\u2019s important to notice that business intelligence companies may also use the first two ways to collect data. For instance, a company can ask the game developer for the data like any other ordinary researcher. A company may also hire a large group of people to complete questionnaires. However, business intelligence companies can still provide original knowledge. For example, SensorTower describes its \u201cApp Intelligence Methodology\u201d as follows:\n\u201cApp Intelligence data is pulled directly from both iOS and Google App stores via API on a daily basis. This helps ensure a high level of data accuracy for ratings, rankings, reviews, metadata, etc. A smaller subset of data (such as keyword difficulty scores) are compiled through data science and modeling, which are regularly updated in line with app store algorithm changes. [59]\u201d.\nOn the one hand, the data pulled from app stores via API (Application Programming Interface) are later included in their business intelligence report. These are second-hand data. At this very\nmoment, these companies provide a synthesis of the knowledge available from other sources instead of providing primary information. Therefore, it\u2019s reasonable to argue these companies may not be comparable to the other two sources. However, on the other hand, the data \u201ccompiled through data science and modeling\u201d seems first-hand data because they use the company\u2019s unique algorithms. A company may also get \u201cexclusive data\u201d from game developers that are not accessible to ordinary people. Therefore, it\u2019s still reasonable to see business intelligence companies as an independent way to get a game\u2019s MAU data.\nIn practice, choosing what approach to collect the MAU data calls for a comprehensive understanding of the task and the resources. It needs a balance between the accuracy, accessibility, granularity, and cost of data. Ideally, data with the highest accuracy is most wanted. A high accuracy guarantees the validity of the data and therefore makes the data convincing. Consequently, it\u2019s reasonable to ask developers to share the data first, then triangle it with business companies\u2019 data or data collected by oneself. But at the same time, accessibility, granularity, and cost are also critical dimensions to be considered by researchers and analysts. As shown in Table 2, each of the current three approaches has advantages and disadvantages in the dimensions. However, none of these approaches can meet the requirements of high accessibility, high data granularity and low cost at the same time. Therefore, a proxy to the MAU data of mobile games is necessary."

            "text": "Geo AR mobile games, aka location-based augmented reality mobile games, refer to the location-aware mobile game that combines live surrounding-based experience with sensory virtual information [44]. This mobile game came out early in 2000, but it didn\u2019t enter the mass market or receive broad monetization until 2016 with Pok\u00e9mon GO\u2019s release [52]. Here are some illustrations of the impressive performance of Pok\u00e9mon GO: it peaked at 100 million users worldwide, 45 million daily unique visitors with 28.5 million in the U.S. alone. It had $832 million in revenue in the launch year, with $2 million in daily revenue estimated [13, 35]. Players flocked into parks and streets as they played the game [20, 21, 40].\nGeo AR mobile games were expected to redefine how players engage with a game and disrupt the video game industry based on the media or analysts in 2016 [25, 39]. Since then, multiple Pok\u00e9mon-GO-like Geo AR mobile games have emerged. And all these games adopted a freemium business model like Pok\u00e9mon GO. Moreover, since 2017, diverse research on the Geo AR mobile game has emerged, covering fields like physical activity, tourism, culture, learning activities, etc. [2, 27, 28, 30, 47, 53, 68].\nHowever, these Geo AR mobile games are usually short-lived and not sustainable. Three have been confirmed discontinued among eight Geo AR mobile games released in 2018 and 2019. Four alive games have struggled with only 1% of their peak MAU. Only the last one alive has maintained a level of 10% of its peak. In 2021, three Geo AR mobile games were released. One of them (i.e., Arabian Nights: Genie\u2019s treasures) was discontinued merely two months after its release. The other two games released in 2021, namely The Witcher: Monster Slayer and Pikmin Bloom, also have less than 10% of their peak MAU and seem to keep losing them without any signs of turning the tide. All these Geo AR mobile games are freemium. Hence, MAU is crucial for monetization approaches, including in-game purchases, subscriptions and advertisements [19, 32]. Therefore, the sustainable survival of Geo AR mobile games, represented by the MAU, is in a crisis [44]. This MAU crisis has again brought the argument whether Geo AR mobile games or augmented reality technology is just hype [9, 15].\nSince the MAU of Geo AR mobile games is a trendy and urgent topic, it\u2019s appropriate for this paper to join the conversation. Moreover, compared with other new forms of mobile games (e.g., cryptogames), Geo AR mobile games have a long history with relatively adequate data expected. Therefore, it\u2019s both meaningful and feasible to investigate the MAU proxy of Geo AR mobile games [37, 58]."

            "text": "As one of the player population metrics, MAU embodies the engagement of players in the game. It\u2019s helpful to look for theories indicating constructs that have relationships to players\u2019 engagement for potential proxies. This paper proposes that the uses and gratification theory can be a proper perspective.\nThe uses and gratification theory is a classic theory to understand why and how individuals actively seek out and use specific media to satisfy specific needs [14, 70]. For example, one user may want to seek information or educate themselves. This is called information-seeking or \u201cinformation motivation.\u201d [36] Also, one may use certain media for hedonic use, called entertainment. Since the uses and gratification theory has been proposed, various gratifications have been developed and identified in different media contexts. This theory has been used and verified in multiple contexts, including online games [71], social media [70], and Geo AR mobile games [27, 57]. Therefore, it\u2019s reasonable to use this well-examined theory to look for potential proxies.\nThe information-seeking gratification matches the topic of this paper. This paper is highly interested in the information about games and may be counted in the field called \u201cgame data science [18].\u201d As mentioned, information-seeking is driven by one\u2019s desire to increase awareness and knowledge of oneself, others, and the world. This logic may also be supported by considering the conversation perspective. Levine, et al. [41] propose that markets are conversations. The Internet has enabled networked conversations as information seeking, which was previously impossible in the mass media era. Technology has enabled people to collect information before making decisions to engage truly. According to a survey by Google, 85% of shoppers find product information and pictures essential for deciding which brand or retailer to buy from. 53% of shoppers always research before purchasing to ensure their choice is the best possible [23]. This \u201cYouTube it before you buy it\u201d trend indicates a strong connection between the information-seeking gratification desired and the actual engagement with one product [55]."

            "text": "Given the relationship indicated by the uses and gratification theory, this paper proposes that the measures of information-seeking motivation may be the proxies needed to represent the engagement of players. Literature finds that people tend to visit wikis to get some information about interesting subjects, use social media to \u201clearn how to make sense of things from their peers on just about any subject [4]\u201d and send queries to search engines [60]. Therefore, wiki views, social media views, the number of social media posts (i.e., contents), and online search volume can be treated as measures of information-seeking. And this paper proposes these measures can be used to predict engagement. The relationships between concepts and variables are proposed in Fig. 1 below based on these previous studies.\nUsing the measures of information-seeking to predict engagement is frequent. Goel, et al. [22] used the online search volume to predict consumer behaviors in diverse genres, including box-office movie revenue, first-month video game sales, and songs\u2019 Billboard rank. Liikkanen and Salovaara [43] used data from YouTube videos to demonstrate user engagement in different types of music videos. These precedents provide justifications for the potential proxies. Based on that, here is the proposition of this paper:\nProposition: When a Geo AR mobile game receives more engagement from the players, more information-seeking about the game occurs.\nBased on the proposition, four hypotheses are developed:\nHypothesis 1: The Wiki views of a Geo AR mobile game have a strong positive correlation with the game\u2019s MAU. Hypothesis 2: The social media views of a Geo AR mobile game have a strong positive correlation with the game\u2019s MAU. Hypothesis 3: The number of social media contents of a Geo AR mobile game has a strong positive correlation with the game\u2019s MAU. Hypothesis 4: The online search volumes of a Geo AR mobile game have a strong positive correlation with the game\u2019s MAU."

            "text": "The Geo AR mobile games considered are those launched after 2016. Geo AR mobile games since then broadly adopted a monetization of freemium. That is the prerequisite to looking for business metrics data on the Internet. LIU [44] pointed out there are twelve games to consider. As inspired by previous studies, the name of each game is used as part of the keyword for inquiry in the search engine Google. For example, when looking for the actual MAU data of Pok\u00e9mon GO, the keyword for inquiry would be \u201cPok\u00e9mon GO monthly active user number,\u201d \u201cPok\u00e9mon GO monthly active user,\u201d \u201cPok\u00e9mon GO metrics,\u201d \u201cPok\u00e9mon GO active users\u201d that are commonly used in the media. This paper aims to obtain the actual MAU data of these twelve Geo AR mobile games possibly available on the Internet. The data can be obtained for free. The targeted time range and granularity can be determined based on the actual MAU data obtained.\nFor wiki views, this paper choosesWikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Main_Page) as it\u2019s the most representative wiki in the world. The views of each page are collected through the\nPageview Analysis tool (https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Pageviews_Analysis). It is a tool to analyze page view statistics [54]. Users of Pageview Analysis can customize the dates, date type (i.e., the granularity of the data to be collected), and the specific Wikipedia project to obtain the data of views of the Geo AR mobile game\u2019s Wikipedia page. The data can be directly exported as a .csv file.\nThis paper chooses Google as the context for online search volumes since it\u2019s the most representative search engine. Google is the most popular search engine globally, with a 70% market share [61]. The online search volume is obtained through Google Trends, a free keyword research tool that provides near real-time trend data regarding interest as operationalized by the internet search volume. It shows the changes in online interest for time series in any selected term in any country or region over a selected period. It should be noted that Google Trends is not the actual amount of the queries in Google. The returned result is a relative value ranging from 0 to 100 based on the proportion. This paper uses the game name as the keyword in Google Trends. The actual MAU data determine the date range. When the Google Trends data is of higher granularity than the actual MAU data, the aggregation is conducted by adding the Google Trends data for each period.\nFor social media views, this paper chooses YouTube as a representative example. YouTube is the second-largest search engine globally [12, 67]. It is a social media featuring videos resonating with the multimedia characteristic of Geo AR mobile games. Using the game name as the keyword and the date range revealed by the actual MAU data collected, YouTube Data API would return a list of the videos searched with the views. The counts and views of videos will be aggregated to match the data granularity embodied in the actual MAU. This paper used Python to unitize the YouTube Data API. We are aware that there are specific game-based social platforms like Discord or Steam. Some studies already utilized the valuable data there to inform game design and player\u2019s psychographic characteristics (e.g., [26]). This study sticks with YouTube because little Geo AR mobile games have their pages on Steam. Discord, however, are used by only a fraction of players compared to YouTube."

            "text": "There are three steps of data analysis in this paper. The first step is data aggregation. The second step is correlation analysis. The third step is bootstrap.\nAfter cleaning the data, the data of potential proxies may be aggregated if the original data does not match the granularity of the actual MAU. For example, suppose the actual MAU of a game is presented as the annual data and the data of the potential proxy is monthly. In that case, the monthly data of the potential proxy will need to be added to get the annual result. It\u2019s not a problem with Wikipedia page views since Pageview Analysis supports customizing the data granularity. It\u2019s not a problem with YouTube video views since the views of each video published at any second are known. The problem may happen in the online search volumes. For example, Google Trends could be a weekly data unmatched by the monthly actual MAU data. At this moment, the concerned weekly Google Trends data would be added to get a monthly aggregation. For a week with some days in one month and the other days in the other month, the weekly Google Trends is averagely divided into the days. The second step is correlation analysis, calculating the Pearson correlation coefficient between the actual MAU and each potential proxy (possibly aggregated). Using the rule of thumb for interpreting the size of a correlation coefficient shown in Table 3, the hypothesis would be tested [49].\nNevertheless, given the scarcity of the actual MAU data, the sample for calculating the correlation coefficient may be small. A correlation relationship between the MAU and a proxy identified in a sample may be partly impacted by the approach to collect MAU or sampling variability. Therefore, it\u2019s necessary to eliminate the variability and approximate the correlation coefficient in the population as closely as possible. For this purpose, the bootstrap method is used. Bootstrap is a resampling method where large samples of the same size are repeatedly drawn, with replacement, from a single original sample [72]. This way, bootstrap creates the resulting distribution of massive samples as a Gaussian distribution, making statistical inference like constructing a Confidence Interval possible [7]. A confidence interval can be described as the range of values one variable may have under a given confidence level. It\u2019s a widely used technique for parameter estimation in fields like medicine [29] and environmental science [65].\nIn this manuscript, the bootstrap method will be used after the discussions on the sample data have been made. The confidence interval of the correlation coefficient between the MAU and each proxy will be made to allow further analysis of the correlation relationship. The bootstrap will be conducted using the \u201cboot\u201d package in R Programming Language [6]. As suggested by Davidson and MacKinnon [11], 399 would be the minimum number of bootstrap samples for testing at the .05 level. Therefore, the size of bootstrap samples is determined as 500."

And there is no data available with higher granularity (e.g., MAU of each month or each quarter). It\u2019s noted that there is a significant correlation between the Actual MAU and Google Trends. Since the correlation coefficient is 0.919 > 0.9, the rule of thumb would suggest a very high positive correlation.

In contrast, the correlation coefficients of other proxies in the sample don\u2019t demonstrate a high mean as that of Google Trends. Their confidence intervals are also wider, indicating a correlation with fewer precisions.\nTable 4 Full data set of the actual MAU and potential proxies of Pok\u00e9mon GO\nTime Actual MAU (in millions)\nGoogle Trends Wikipedia Views YouTube Video Counts\nYouTube Video Views"

So do the correlations between Google Trends and YouTube video counts besidesWikipedia views and YouTube video views. However, these specific correlation relationships come from all the five annual data of Pok\u00e9mon GO. To increase the rigor and relevance of the correlation between the actual MAU and Google Trends, it\u2019s necessary to conduct the correlation analysis in the subsets of data of Pok\u00e9mon GO. On the one hand, if the correlation remains significant and strong even in short periods of observation, the correlation is more rigorous and convincing than a coincidence of the data.\nOn the other hand, the usefulness of MAU and its proxy can hardly be achieved if the yearby-year results are neglected. In real life, hardly a game may survive five years. Therefore, if proxies are expected to function, they must have consistent correlation relationships with the actual MAU even in possibly shorter periods. Therefore, the correlation analysis has been conducted in the subsets of data.\nThe data for shorter periods are subsets of the full data set. Meaningful subsets should meet two requirements. First, given that the full data are continuous in chronological order, the subset data shall be continuous and in chronological order. Second, a subset must have at least three data points for correlation analysis to determine the relationship\u2019s significance, direction and strength. Although it\u2019s feasible to conduct correlation analysis on subsets with merely two data points, it\u2019s hardly meaningful in practice. Their significance level would always be 0.000, and the coefficient would be either 1 or \u2212 1. Based on these two criteria, subsets are picked up and analyzed. Table 7 below shows subsets picked up and the correlation analysis results.\nThere is no significant correlation between the actual MAU and each proposed proxy in subsets. The only exception is \u201cActual MAU \u2013 YouTube Video Views\u201d in the subset [2017, 2018, 2019, 2020]. The correlation coefficient is \u22120.989 with a Sig. (2-tailed) of 0.011 < 0.05. Besides, there are two scenarios with a marginal significance value. One is \u201cActual MAU \u2013 Google Trends\u201d whose correlation coefficient is 0.942 with a Sig. (2-tailed) of 0.058. The other is \u201cActual MAU \u2013 YouTube Video Views\u201d whose correlation coefficient is \u22120.997 with a Sig. (2-tailed) of 0.050. Therefore, the significance and strength of correlation in these data subsets are inconsistent with those found in the full data set. To put it another way, significant correlation relationships only exist in a data set with five data points."

The findings from these results are listed below:\n1) Among subsets with at least six consecutive data points, there is always a significant positive correlation between the actual MAU and Google Trends at the 0.05 level (2- tailed) at least. Therefore, it\u2019s reasonable to say the correlation is robust and consistent in these subsets. Moreover, these robust significant correlations between the actual MAU andGoogle Trends are all high. As shown in Table 11, the correlation coefficients derived from data subsets with at least six consecutive data points are all larger than 0.8. Based on the rule of thumb in Table 3, these results show a high positive correlation since the correlation coefficients are all larger than 0.7. In contrast, neither the correlation between the actual MAU and YouTube Video Counts nor that between the actual MAU and YouTube Video Views demonstrates a similar consistency. 2) Among all six subsets with five consecutive data points, Google Trends demonstrated a significant and strong correlation with the actual MAU in four subsets. In these four scenarios, the correlation coefficients are all larger than 0.7, indicating a high correlation.\nYouTube Video Counts and YouTube Video Views have less than two scenarios demonstrating a significant correlation. 3) In data sets with less than five data points, there is no significant correlation between the actual MAU and any proxies. The only exception is the scenario [A, B, C, D], where three proxies demonstrated a significant correlation with the actual MAU.\nIn summary, only Google Trends demonstrates a very high and significant correlation with the actual MAU in both games in the full data set.Wikipedia views, YouTube video counts and views are high and significant in the case of The Walking Dead: Our World but not significant in the case of Pok\u00e9mon GO. In data subsets of Pok\u00e9mon GO, none of the correlation relationships remain significant. However, in subsets of The Walking Dead: Our World, the correlation between the actual MAU and Google Trends remains significant and strong if more than five quarterly data are included.

            "text": "The actual MAU of The Walking Dead: Our World is highly reliable since it\u2019s in the reports directly provided by the game developers. In that case, all three potential proxies have a high, positive and significant correlation with the actual MAU. Also, these three potential proxies are correlated with each other in a high, positive and significant way. That confirms the expectation conceptualized from the uses and gratification theory and previous studies about these potential proxies. All these three potential proxies reflect the general level of the information-seeking behavior of the players. Therefore, they are expected to be closely related, as shown in the result. Since information-seeking and engagement are related, it\u2019s no wonder each of the potential proxies has a strong correlation with the actual MAU. Wikipedia and Google Trends have been widely used to forecast for a long time. The Walking Dead: Our World investigation confirmed that both are still good indicators of information-seeking in the context of Geo AR mobile games [22]. Surprisingly, YouTube video counts and views have a high, positive, and significant correlation with the actual MAU of the game. These results about YouTube videos may suggest the importance of video social platforms in terms of the multimedia objects like video games.\nThe actual MAU of Pok\u00e9mon GO comes from the business intelligence companies and is second-hand. Only the online search volume has a high, positive and significant correlation with the actual MAU among the four potential proxies. Wiki and social media views don\u2019t pass the statistical test, but the p-values are relatively marginal. This paper tends to interpret this because of the poor quality of the actual MAU data. However, it\u2019s confirmed that the online search volume is a robust proxy to the MAU of a Geo AR mobile game. This paper responds the two problems of game player analytics challenge proposed by Su, et al. [62]. With the results from the samples and bootstrap analysis, this study suggests that using the online search volume as a proxy can save the data collection cost with a still high validity.\nFurthermore, it\u2019s noted that Google Trends has a high, positive and significant correlation with the YouTube video counts. That may indicate that the YouTube content creators notice people\u2019s queries about the game and upload related videos to go with the tide. These YouTube videos may reversely attract onlookers and elicit more queries in the search engine. Similarly, there is a high, positive and significant correlation between Wikipedia views and YouTube video views. This may suggest a general interest in seeking information about Pok\u00e9mon GO among the public.\nThese correlations are identified in the aggregated data covering a long time range. In the context of Pok\u00e9mon GO, it is annual data covering five years. In the context of The Walking Dead: Our World, it is the quarterly data covering two and a half years. However, for both the rigor and relevance of the research, these correlations are tested in subsets of data. On the one hand, in the context of The Walking Dead: Our World, the correlation between the actual MAU andGoogle Trends remains significant and high even in a smaller range of observations, namely six quarterly MAU data covering one and a half years. The correlations between the actual MAU and other proxies are also significant to a different level in the data subsets. On the other hand, however, the correlation between the actual MAU and Google Trends is not significant in any subsets of data. Reflections on these results on the subsets are listed below:\n1) The reason why correlation is significant in data subsets of The Walking Dead: Our World but not significant in data subsets of Pok\u00e9mon GO may be the difference in data quality. The actual MAU of The Walking Dead: Our World originated from the game developer\u2019s financial statements and audio cast presentations [50, 51]. Therefore, the correlation can be consistent and robust even in smaller data subsets. But the actual MAU data of Pok\u00e9mon GO used is from business intelligence companies which are not as accurate as the ones directly given by the game developer. Therefore, although the correlation pattern is significant if one aggregates all the data, it cannot remain significant in subsets of data. 2) There seem to be some conditions for Google Trends to function as an ideal proxy to the actual MAU. For example, even in the context of The Walking Dead: Our World, the significant correlation doesn\u2019t firmly exist in subsets with less than six data points covering one and a half years. To put it another way, a Geo AR mobile game may have to survive at least one and a half years for the correlation pattern between the actual MAU and Google Trends to emerge, facilitating the use of Google Trends as a proxy to the actual MAU. This interpretation is also plausible in the context of Pok\u00e9mon GO. Over the five years of Pok\u00e9mon GO, only 32 game updates contributed to the increase and the stop of decrease in the active user base. It\u2019s not likely that every week something changes in the game. Players also need time to recognize what has changed in the game, which is later reflected in their information-seeking behavior. That said, the conditions for using Google Trends to represent the actual MAU of a Geo AR mobile game may be subject to the minimum requirements of game release time, the number of updates implemented in the game and the general level of players\u2019 recognition of what\u2019s happening in the game. Enough data points may be really necessary for both analysis and prediction."

            "text": "The \u201cspecificity \u2013 generalizability\u201d issue (or called the \u201ccontext \u2013 generalizability\u201d issue) has been widely discussed in fields like information systems and psychology research [8, 10, 63]. In this paper, it\u2019s about to what extent the findings are specific to the Geo AR mobile game context and to what extent it is general to any other kinds of video games or even software. This paper argues that the proxies of the actual MAU are specific in terms of the AR and geolocation functions in the game. These functions, enabled by the AR engine (e.g., ARCore and ARKit) and geolocation engine (e.g., Google Maps), are distinctive characteristics of Geo AR mobile games [44]. However, these proxies can also be applied to general video games and software.\nGeo AR mobile games are \u201clocation-aware mobile games that combine live surroundingsbased experience with sensory virtual information\u201d [44]. Currently, the common way is to use the AR engine and geolocation engine to create such a game experience. Therefore, it\u2019s reasonable to say AR and geolocation engines are where Geo AR mobile games are distinct from other kinds of video games. With that, the actual MAU and proxies of a Geo AR mobile game can be influenced by changes in the in-game events or settings related to AR and geolocation. For example, COVID-19 has caused great discontinuance to the settings and events in Geo AR mobile games [38]. For these games, their geolocation feature by nature demands outdoor activities. But in the pandemic era, the governments strictly regulate outdoor activities and, therefore, damage players\u2019 engagement with the game. As a result, multiple Geo AR mobile games blamed the pandemic for their discontinuance [5, 69]. However, some\ngames took adaptive actions in the game as a response to the pandemic regulations and increased the number of active players. For example, Pok\u00e9mon GO used the legendary Pok\u00e9mon Darkrai in raids and its shiny form (available 6\u20138 March and again 28 April\u20135 May) to attract players and counter the effect of self-regulation about COVID-19 in Finland. These actions managed to increase players\u2019 motivation to play the game even in the pandemic era [38]. Similarly, if there were regulations on the use of cameras in the public area, namely limiting the use of AR function, players\u2019 information-seeking and engagement in Geo AR mobile games is expected to decrease. That will also be reflected in the volume of proxies and the actual MAU. Therefore, a general limitation or encouragement on people\u2019s use of video games should impact the proxies and the actual MAU level of Geo AR mobile games as well.\nHowever, individuals\u2019 information-seeking and engagement are not limited to Geo AR mobile games or other video games, as suggested by the uses and gratification theory. Different contexts can include social media and movie box offices [22, 43]. Therefore, the findings of the paper can be generalized to a different context. The difference may be the factors that may bring change in the proxies and the actual MAU. For example, the correlation between Google Trends and the actual MAU of a game featuring virtual reality (VR) could also be significant and strong, like the Geo AR mobile game in this paper. However, their metrics may be sensitive to the events related to VR instead of AR or geolocation.\nThe findings of this paper, namely using the proxies to represent the actual MAU, could be a technique used in the context of Geo AR mobile games and others. With this technique, it\u2019s possible to know the general performance of a game. Especially by focusing on the discontinuance in the data, it\u2019s possible to locate factors that contribute greatly to the game. These factors can be changes in the game (e.g., an update in the geolocation and AR engine in Pok\u00e9mon GO) or some environmental change (e.g., pandemic regulations on outdoor activities). In this way, game designers and researchers could identify patterns between these factors and players\u2019 engagement. These patterns may be used to further polish the distinct characteristics of Geo AR mobile games or make a game \u201ccomplete\u201d to capture a larger group audience [44]."

            "heading": "6 Conclusion",
            "text": "This paper starts from the proposition that players\u2019 engagement with a Geo AR mobile game can be captured through the information-seeking phenomenon about the game on the Internet. Precisely, players\u2019 engagement is measured through MAU. The information-seeking phenomenon is measured with wiki views, social media views and online search volumes. This paper further proposed four hypotheses of correlations between the actual MAU and each potential proxy. Only two games\u2019 actual MAU data among twelve Geo AR mobile games are obtained, confirming the scarcity of the data. The four hypotheses are tested. Only the online search volume demonstrates a robust, high, strong, and significant correlation with the actual MAU data of the games. Therefore, the online search volume is validated as a proxy to the MAU of a Geo AR mobile game.\nThe contributions of this paper are three-folded. First, this paper validates the online search volume as a proxy of the MAU. Researchers and analysts now may use the online search volume to track, monitor and forecast the players\u2019 engagement with a Geo AR mobile game without being hampered by the scarcity of the actual MAU data. Given the high and significant correlation, the online search volume may be used to demonstrate the pattern and discontinuity\nof the engagement over time compatible with typical analysis techniques. In other words, this paper validates the online search volume as a tool to investigate the players\u2019 engagement. Second, this paper validates the traditional engagement indicators in the new technology context, namely the Geo AR mobile games. Wiki views, social media posts and views are long-established indicators of users\u2019 engagement in public opinions, commerce and traditional entertainment. This paper shows they are still good indicators in the Geo AR mobile games context. Some of the findings are not as ideal as expected because of the data quality. Future studies may collect more data with better reliabilities to test. Third, this paper points out that the online search volume could be a potentially disruptive innovation. This discussion may suggest an emerging market of business intelligence.\nThis paper is not without limitations. First, only four potential proxies are proposed and tested. This paper focuses on wikis, social media and search engines, given their reliability and validity in previous studies. But it\u2019s reasonable to argue that more measurements of information-seeking can be proposed as a proxy to the MAU, capturing the players\u2019 engagement. Second, there should be more alternatives for each potential proxy. To capture the social media views and posts, one may use the data of posts on other social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Third, this paper only examined two Geo AR mobile games. Although both games are representative, more data of different games (not only Geo AR mobile games) are welcomed to enlarge the test data set. Fourth, this paper\u2019s analysis results of data subsets are not ideal. This paper tends to be quick to propose the idea of proxying the actual MAU with the online search volume. Further investigations on \u201csmall data,\u201d namely a shorter period of observation, are encouraged to enhance the rigor and relevance of the research. Fifth, this paper only provides a primary discussion on the role of business intelligence companies. As pointed out, these companies may function as both a synthesizer of present data and a provider of original knowledge. It\u2019s valuable further to differentiate these two roles of business intelligence companies.\nFuture research may consider the following directions to overcome the limitations of this paper and extend the findings. First, more measurements of information-seeking or other constructs suggested by theories could be examined as a proxy to the MAU. For example, for games built on the blockchain, it\u2019s possible to use the blockchain transaction network information to estimate the level of the game\u2019s popularity [33]. Second, more sources and approaches to collecting data are encouraged. Scholars and analysts can compare their data and grasp a game\u2019s player engagement more accurately with more options. Especially the three approaches to obtaining a game\u2019s MAU data are compared based on limited empirical findings in this paper. In fact, it\u2019s noted that the confidence intervals in the case of The Walking Dead: Our World are generally narrower than those in the case of Pok\u00e9mon GO. This may suggest a difference in data reliability between using developers\u2019 data and business intelligence company data. Future studies are recommended to further evaluate these approaches, including online search volume as the proxy, in terms of accuracy, accessibility, granularity and cost of their data. Third, the findings of this paper can be tested in more and diverse contexts-for example, other Geo AR mobile games, other video games or other software. Fourth, data from shorter period observation are welcome to increase the rigor and relevance of this paper\u2019s findings. It\u2019s possible that to use the proxies to represent a game\u2019s actual MAU, a minimum level of time and update volumes are necessary. If so, it would be meaningful to find these requirements to facilitate the proxies. Fifth, case studies on the roles of business intelligence companies are necessary. How could one differentiate its role as a primary source and a synthesizer? How do these companies see themselves? These questions can be meaningful.\nData availability The datasets generated during and/or analysed during the current study are available from the corresponding author on reasonable request.\nDeclarations\nCompeting interests The authors have no competing interests to declare that are relevant to the content of this article.
