Large language models (LLMs) have been applied to tasks in healthcare, ranging from medical exam questions to responding to patient questions. With increasing institutional partnerships between companies producing LLMs and healthcare systems, real world clinical application is coming closer to reality. As these models gain traction, it is essential for healthcare practitioners to understand what LLMs are, their development, their current and potential applications, and the associated pitfalls when utilized in medicine. This review and accompanying tutorial aim to give an overview of these topics to aid healthcare practitioners in understanding the rapidly changing landscape of LLMs as applied to medicine. 1. conclusion LLMs have risen in popularity as models become more widely available for public use. With technological advancements and spread in popularity, potential opportunities exist for application of LLMs in the medical field. Multiple tech companies have already developed models trained with the intention to perform medical tasks. There are several areas of medicine where LLMs could be employed, such as completing administrative tasks (e.g. : summarizing medical notes), augmenting clinician knowledge (e.g. : translating patient materials), medical education (e.g. : creating new exam questions), and medical research (e.g. : generating novel research ideas). Despite these opportunities, many notable challenges with LLMs remain unresolved, limiting the implementation of these models in medicine. Issues surrounding underlying biases in datasets, data quality and unpredictability of outputs, and patient privacy and ethical concerns make innovations in LLMs difficult to translate to adoption in healthcare settings in their current form. Physicians and other healthcare professionals must weigh potential opportunities with these existing limitations as they seek to incorporate LLMs into their practice of medicine.
