            "text": "Clinical research relies on high-quality patient data, however, obtaining big data sets is costly and access 37 to existing data is often hindered by privacy and regulatory concerns. Synthetic data generation holds 38 the promise of effectively bypassing these boundaries allowing for simplified data accessibility and the 39 prospect of synthetic control cohorts. We employed two different methodologies of generative artificial 40 intelligence \u2013 CTAB-GAN+ and normalizing flows (NFlow) \u2013 to synthesize patient data derived from 41 1606 patients with acute myeloid leukemia, a heterogeneous hematological malignancy, that were 42 treated within four multicenter clinical trials. Both generative models accurately captured distributions 43 of demographic, laboratory, molecular and cytogenetic variables, as well as patient outcomes yielding 44 high performance scores regarding fidelity and usability of both synthetic cohorts (n=1606 each). 45 Survival analysis demonstrated close resemblance of survival curves between original and synthetic 46 cohorts. Inter-variable relationships were preserved in univariable outcome analysis enabling 47 explorative analysis in our synthetic data. Additionally, training sample privacy is safeguarded 48 mitigating possible patient re-identification, which we quantified using Hamming distances. We provide 49 not only a proof-of-concept for synthetic data generation in multimodal clinical data for rare diseases, 50 but also full public access to synthetic data sets to foster further research. 51\nIntroduction 52\nIn the age of big data, the paucity of publicly available medical data sets is often staggering. Despite 53 extensive data collection efforts, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas(1), the public availability of 54 comprehensive entity-specific data sets remains largely unsatisfactory. Data sharing is often hindered 55 by concerns of patient privacy, regulatory aspects, and proprietary interests.(2) These factors do not only 56 impede progress in medical research but also establish a gatekeeping mechanism that restricts specific 57 research inquiries to large institutions with access to extensive datasets. Collecting such data sets is a 58 costly and time-consuming effort and especially later-phase clinical trials usually take years to complete 59 and require millions in funding.(3,4) In particular, this is true for rare diseases, such as acute myeloid 60 leukemia (AML), which is a genetically heterogenous and highly aggressive hematological malignancy 61 with so far unsatisfactory patient outcomes despite recent advances in therapy.(5) In addition, the 62 development of targeted therapies for defined subgroups leads to an increased need for control 63 groups.(6) To gain insights into such burdensome malignant entities with unmet medical needs, a crowd-64 sourcing of data to refine risk stratification efforts and test treatment-related hypothesis is essential. If 65 machine learning methods are to be deployed in such data sets, the size of available diverse training data 66 is paramount for model robustness. Generative models, especially generative adversarial neural 67 networks (GANs)(7), have exhibited remarkable capabilities in image generation(8), but can also 68 effectively generate synthetic non-image data. The unique properties of generative artificial intelligence 69 (AI) yield the prospect of synthesizing data based on real patients, which can be distributed at will since, 70 ideally, synthetic data only mimics real patient data alleviating concerns of privacy. In this scenario, the 71 synthetic data itself should preserve the biological characteristics of the disease under investigation to 72 make inferences to real-world applications possible. At the same time, synthetic data should safeguard 73 privacy of the underlying training cohort. 74\nIn this study, we employ two state-of-the-art technologies of generative modeling on a large training 75 data set of four pooled multicenter clinical trials including AML patients with comprehensive clinical 76 and genetic information. We investigate how closely the synthetic data resembles the real trial data 77 aligning baseline characteristics and patient outcome. Further, we measure privacy conservation in the 78\nsynthetic data. Additionally, we provide both final fully synthetic data sets comprising 1606 AML 79 patients each in a publicly accessible repository to foster further research into this devastating disease. 80\n81\nMethods 82"

            "text": "Multimodal clinical, laboratory, and genetic data (Table S1) were obtained from 1606 patients with non-84 M3 AML that were treated within previously conducted multicentric prospective clinical trials of the 85 German Study Alliance Leukemia (SAL; AML96 [NCT00180115](9), AML2003 [NCT00180102](10), 86 AML60+ [NCT00180167](11), and SORAML [NCT00893373](12)). Table S2 shows an overview of 87 trial protocols. Eligibility was determined upon diagnosis of AML, age \u226518 years, and curative treatment 88 intent. All patients gave their written informed consent according to the revised Declaration of 89 Helsinki.(13) All studies were previously approved by the Institutional Review Board of the Technical 90 University Dresden. Complete remission (CR), event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS) 91 were defined according to the revised ELN criteria.(14) Biomaterial was obtained from bone marrow 92 aspirates or peripheral blood prior to treatment initiation. Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) was 93 performed using the TruSight Myeloid Sequencing Panel (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Pooled 94 samples were sequenced paired-end and a 5% variant allele frequency (VAF) mutation calling cut-off 95 was used with human genome build HG19 as a reference as previously described in detail.(15) 96 Additionally, high resolution fragment analysis for FLT3-ITD(16), NPM1(17), and CEBPA(18) was 97 performed as described previously. For cytogenetics, standard techniques for chromosome banding and 98 fluorescence-in-situ-hybridization (FISH) were used. 99\n100\nGenerative models 101\nIn our study, we used two state-of-the-art generative models exhibiting two fundamentally different 102 concepts of data generation: 103\ni) CTAB-GAN+(19) builds upon the Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)(20) architecture, 104 consisting of two interlinked neural networks - the generator and the discriminator. These are jointly 105 trained in an adversarial manner. The generator\u2019s goal is to produce synthetic data that appears realistic, 106 starting from random noise. In parallel, the discriminator seeks to differentiate between real and 107 synthetic samples created by the generator. The training continues until the discriminator is no longer 108 able to reliably distinguish real data from synthetic, indicating that the generator has successfully 109 approximated the distribution of the real data. 110\nii) Normalizing Flows (NFlow)(21) presents an alternative approach for synthesizing data from complex 111 distributions. This comprises a sequence of invertible transformations, starting from a simple base 112 distribution. Each transformation, or 'flow', gradually modifies this base distribution into a more 113 complex one that better mirrors the actual data. Importantly, these transformations are stackable, 114 meaning they can be applied successively to incrementally increase the complexity of the modeled 115 distribution. All parameters defining these flows are learned directly from the data, allowing the model 116 to accurately capture the underlying data distribution. Note, that we used a modification of NFlow for 117 survival data provided by the Synthcity(22) software framework. 118\nNo imputation of missing data was performed in the original data set, thus both final synthetic data sets 119 also contain missing data to adequately represent real-world conditions. Hyperparameter tuning was 120 performed using the Optuna framework allowing both generative models to capture the best possible 121 representation of the original data. Afterwards, we trained each model with five different random seeds 122 and sampled from it three times, which generated 15 synthetic datasets for each model. Results are 123 reported for each highest-performing synthetic data set, respectively. 124\n125 Evaluation of synthetic data performance 126\nTo assess the fidelity und usability of synthetic data, previously proposed evaluation metrics were used 127 to provide a comprehensive overview of model performance. In particular, Basic Statistical Measure, 128 Regularized Support Coverage, and Log-transformed Correlation Score were used to evaluate the 129 fidelity of the data in general via our implementation based on the descriptions by Chundawat et al.(23). 130\nThe second set of metrics \u2013 Kaplan-Meier-Divergence, Optimism and Short-Sightedness - was 131 previously introduced by Norcliffe et al.(24) for synthetic survival data, and implemented in 132 Synthcity(22). For improved comparability, performance metrics were normalized on a scale from 0 133 (inadequate representation of original data) to 1 (optimal representation). An overview of the underlying 134 methodologies of these metrics is provided in Table S3. For detailed information, we refer the interested 135 reader to the original publications.(23,24) 136\n137\nAssessment of privacy conservation 138\nTo assess potential privacy implications of synthetic data, we customized the method proposed by 139 Platzer and Reutterer(25) to accommodate for smaller sample sizes. We partitioned the original training 140 data (80% of total) into four subsets, matching the size of the test dataset (20%) for balanced 141 comparisons (Fig. S1). Calculations were performed using Hamming distance(26) for categorical 142 features. Numerical variables were binned (n=10 bins each) and thereby categorized to enable Hamming 143 distance calculations. Given the nature of the Hamming distance metric, the average minimum distance 144 effectively denotes the number of variables that would need to be altered for a synthetic patient to match 145 a real patient. We compared the average distances of the synthetic data to the training (syn \u2192 train) and 146 test sets (syn \u2192 test). The relationship between both can be expressed as a coefficient for each synthetic 147 data set compared to training and test set: 148\n\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc66 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc53\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc61 = \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5b \u2192 \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc61\n\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc66\ud835\udc5b \u2192 \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b \u2212 1 149\nBy analyzing whether the synthetic data is closer to the training set compared to the test set, we can 150 assess whether the synthetic data is overly representative of the training data, thereby posing potential 151 privacy concerns. If the average distances from the synthetic data to the training and test data are equally 152 small, the privacy leakage coefficient will also be small. The lower the privacy leakage coefficient, the 153 lower the likelihood of re-identification for patients in the training set. We assumed that values above 154 0.05 signal potential privacy breaches, as they suggest the synthetic data is substantially closer to the 155 training set than to the test set. Conversely, values below 0.05 denote a favorable privacy safeguard, 156\nsignaling similar distances between the training and test sets. Additionally, the number of exact subject 157 matches between the synthetic and original cohorts was determined. 158\n159\nStatistical analysis 160\nPairwise analyses were conducted between the original and both synthetic data sets. Normality was 161 assessed using the Shapiro-Wilk test. If the assumption of normality was met, continuous variables 162 between two samples were analyzed using the two-sided unpaired t-test. If the assumption of normality 163 was violated, continuous variables between two samples were analyzed using the Wilcoxon rank sum 164 (syn. Mann-Whitney) test. Fisher\u2019s exact test was used to compare categorical variables. Univariate 165 analyses for binary outcomes (CR rate) were carried out via logistic regression to obtain odds ratios 166 (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (95%-CI). Time-to-event analyses (EFS, OS) were carried out using 167 Cox proportional hazard models to obtain hazard ratios (HR) and 95%-CI. Kaplan-Meier analyses were 168 performed for time-to-event data (EFS, OS) and corresponding log-rank tests are reported. Median 169 follow-up time was calculated using the reverse Kaplan-Meier method.(27) All tests were carried out as 170 two-sided tests. Statistical significance was determined using a significance level \u03b1 of 0.05. Statistical 171 analysis was performed using STATA BE 18.0 (Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA). 172\n173\nData availability 174\nThe final synthetic data sets generated and analyzed for the purpose of this study are publicly available 175 at https://zenodo.org/record/8334265 176\n177\nCode availability 178\nThe code generated for the purpose of this study is publicly available at 179 https://github.com/waldemar93/synthetic_data_pipeline 180\n181\nResults 182\nSynthetic cohorts generated by CTAB-GAN+ and NFlow score highly in fidelity metrics 183\nWe generated equally sized data sets of n=1606 synthetic patients with each generative model to 184 compare patient variables to the original cohort. The fidelity of synthetic data was assessed with three 185 previously proposed performance metrics scaled from 0 (inadequate representation) to 1 (optimal 186 representation). First, the distribution of each individual variable was compared between original and 187 synthetic data again yielding high scores for both models (Regularized Support Coverage(23) for 188 CTAB-GAN+: 0.95 and NFlow: 0.97). Second, continuous numerical variables were assessed by 189 comparing mean, median, and standard deviation between original and synthetic data per variable (Basic 190 Statistical Measure(23)) showing high scores for both CTAB-GAN+ (0.91) and NFlow (0.92). Third, 191 regarding accurate representations of inter-variable correlations, CTAB-GAN+ and NFlow achieved a 192 Log-Transformed Correlation Score(23) of 0.75 and 0.74, respectively. An overview of performance 193 metrics is provided in Tab. S4 (usability; survival metrics are reported with survival analysis). 194\n195\nSynthetic clinical and genetic patient characteristics closely mimic those of real patients 196\nBaseline patient characteristics compared between real and synthetic patients are shown in Table 1. It 197 has to be noted that given the large sample sizes (three groups with n=1606 each), even small effect 198 sizes yield statistically significant differences. For instance, median age in the original cohort was 56 199 years, while synthetic patients generated by CTAB-GAN+ had a slightly younger median age of 53 200 years (p=0.0001), whereas NFlow-generated patients had a slightly older median age of 58 years 201 (p=0.039). Sex distribution did not differ between NFlow and the original cohort, while CTAB-GAN+ 202 generated more males than females (NFLOW: 56.2% vs. 43.8%; original: 52.2% vs. 47.8%; p=0.023). 203 The rates of de novo, secondary, and therapy-associated AML did not differ significantly for CTAB-204 GAN+ generated patients, while NFlow generated fewer de novo and more therapy-associated AML 205 patients compared to the original cohort. Hemoglobin levels and platelet count did not differ 206 significantly between the original and the synthetic cohorts, while synthetic patients generated by 207 CTAB-GAN+ showed a significantly higher median white blood cell count than the original cohort. 208\nFifty molecular and cytogenetic alterations were included in generating synthetic patients. Figure 1 209 displays the distribution of these alterations across the original and synthetic cohorts (absolute numbers 210 and p-values are provided in Tab. S5). These alterations encompass genes that code for epigenetic 211 regulators (Fig. 1A), the cohesin complex (Fig. 1B), transcription factors (Fig. 1C), TP53 and 212 Nucleophosmin 1 (Fig. 1D), signaling factors (Fig. 1E), components of the spliceosome (Fig. 1F), and 213 cytogenetic aberrations with established impact on patient outcome (Fig. 1G). Overall, the rates of 214 alterations in both synthetic cohorts were in a plausible range with a few deviations from the original 215 cohort of high statistical significance, such as NFlow-generated frequencies of BCORL1, DNMT3A, 216 PHF6, and ZRSR2, as well as CTAB-GAN+-generated frequencies of CUX1 and GATA2 while the 217 remainder of alterations showed only negligible differences. Aside from the frequency per individual 218 alteration, the co-occurrences of alterations play an important role in disease biology, which should be 219 also captured in high-quality synthetic data. Fig. 2 shows the relative differences between the original 220 cohort and CTAB-GAN+ (Fig. 2A) and NFlow (Fig. 2B) regarding co-occurring mutations. We found 221 high congruencies for co-occurrences compared to the original cohort, while deviations were commonly 222 found in alterations that had a low frequency in the original cohort. 223\n224\nSynthetic cohorts match real patients in outcome and survival analysis 225\nMedian follow-up for the original cohort was 89.5 months (95%-CI: 85.5-95.4). The synthetic cohorts 226 had a median follow-up of 91.3 months (CTAB-GAN+, 95%-CI: 84.8-98.0) and 74.3 months (NFlow, 227 95%-CI: 70.9-77.4). Table 2 shows a detailed comparison of patient outcome between the original and 228 both synthetic cohorts. For CR rates, we found no significant differences between the original (70.7%) 229 and both synthetic cohorts (CTAB-GAN+: 73.7%; NFlow: 69.1%). Median EFS in the original cohort 230 was 7.2 months while both CTAB-GAN+ with 12.8 months and NFlow with 9.0 months deviated with 231 high significance. This effect can arguably be attributed to both CR rate and OS being included in 232 hyperparameter tuning, while EFS was exempt from hyperparameter tuning. Kaplan-Meier analysis 233 nevertheless showed a plausible representation of the survival curves for both synthetic cohorts 234 regarding EFS (Fig. 3A). Median OS for the original cohort was 17.5 months while the CTAB-GAN+ 235\ncohort had a median OS of 19.5 months (p<0.0001) and NFlow of 16.2 months (p=0.055). Kaplan-Meier 236 analysis (Fig. 3B) showed similar behavior of survival curves as for EFS. This was also evident with 237 regard to usability metrics for synthetic survival data introduced by Norcliffe et al.(24): We found both 238 CTAB-GAN+ and NFlow to score high in our test set with normalized performance results (+1 is 239 optimal representation, 0 is inadequate representation, Tab. S4). Kaplan-Meier-Divergence, i.e. the 240 degree to which survival curves of synthetic and real data differ, was low for both synthetic data sets 241 (CTAB-GAN+: 0.97, NFlow: 0.98). Neither model showed overt optimism or overt pessimism in 242 representing survival data (CTAB-GAN+: 0.98, NFlow: 0.99). For both EFS and OS, the curve of 243 CTAB-GAN+ showed no stabilization of survival rates towards the end of the follow-up period in 244 comparison to the curve of the original cohort while NFlow tends to censor a higher rate of patients after 245 passing the 2-year follow-up mark. Nonetheless, Short-sightedness, i.e. failure to predict beyond a 246 certain time point, was also low for both models, however slightly favoring CTAB-GAN+ over NFlow 247 (CTAB-GAN+: 0.99, NFlow: 0.93) arguably corresponding to the censoring tendency of NFlow. 248\n249\nSynthetic data captures risk associations of individual variables for explorative analyses 250\nIn order to be useful for explorative analyses, synthetic data needs to recapitulate risk associations of 251 individual variables. The ELN2022 recommendations represent one of the most widely used guidelines 252 for risk stratification.(14) Hence, previously established markers of favorable (normal karyotype, 253 t(8;21), inv(16) or t(16;16) mutations of NPM1, CEBPA-bZIP in frame mutations), intermediate risk 254 (FLT3-ITD, t(9;11)), or adverse risk (complex karyotype, -5, del(5q), -7, -17, mutations of TP53, 255 RUNX1, ASXL1), and age were evaluated using univariable analyses per cohort for their impact on 256 achievement of CR, EFS, and OS. All effects for achievement of CR, EFS, and OS showed the same 257 directionality \u2013 favorable affects in the original cohort were also favorable in synthetic cohorts and vice 258 versa \u2013 and significance \u2013 effects that were significant in the original cohort were also significant in 259 synthetic cohorts and vice versa (except for del(5q) being significantly associated with failure to achieve 260 CR in the original cohort while this effect turned out to be non-significant in the NFlow-generated 261 cohort). Importantly, no inverse effects \u2013 a variable that would be favorable in the original cohort would 262\nbe adverse in a synthetic cohort or vice versa \u2013 were observed. Detailed outcomes per variable are 263 reported for CR (Tab. S6), EFS (Tab. S7), and OS (Tab. S8). 264\n265 Synthetically generated cohorts safeguard real patient data and prohibit re-identification 266\nPrivacy conservation was measured by: i) number of exact matches between original and synthetic 267 cohorts, ii) a privacy leakage coefficient based on Hamming distance, and iii) absolute Hamming 268 distances showing the number of variables to be altered per synthetic patient to match a real patient. 269 First, for both synthetic data sets the number of exact matches compared to the original cohort was zero. 270 Second, the average minimum distances compared between datapoints in training and test sets were 271 similar for the original cohort, as well as synthetic data from both CTAB-GAN+ and NFlow (Tab. 3). 272 The privacy leakage coefficient \u2013 the quotient of Hamming distances between synthetic to test divided 273 by synthetic to training data where small values (<0.05) indicate a small difference between the distances 274 of synthetic data to training and test data, and therefore, indicate no privacy breach \u2013 was very low for 275 both CTAB-GAN+ and NFlow (Tab. 3). This signals a low likelihood of re-identification for both 276 synthetic datasets. Third, the median number of variables that would have to be altered to assign a 277 synthetic patient to a training set patient was nine for both CTAB-GAN+ and NFlow. 278\n279 Discussion 280\nSynthetic data provide an attractive solution to circumvent issues in current standards of data collection 281 and sharing. These issues encompass first and foremost the time- and cost-intensive data collection 282 process that usually involves enrollment of patients in prospective clinical trials presenting ever-283 increasing costs both regarding funding and time until completion, as well as ethical concerns inherent 284 in clinical research with human subjects.(3,4) The prospect of using synthetic data as a novel kind of 285 control group in prospective trials while effectively alleviating the need to enroll a larger number of 286 patients and cutting costs bears the question of how closely such synthetic control arms match real-287 world cohorts. We used two generative AI technologies, a state-of-the-art GAN, CTAB-GAN+, and 288 NFlow, to mimic the distribution of patient variables from four different previously conducted 289\nprospective multicenter trials including a total of 1606 patients with AML. Both models demonstrated 290 high performance in previously established evaluation metrics that assess fidelity and usability of 291 synthetic tabular data.(23,24) The comparison of distributions per variable between original and real 292 data further showed close resemblances. Notably, even for statistically significant deviations from the 293 original cohort, differences in effect sizes (e.g. age difference, difference in rates of occurrence for 294 genetic alterations etc.) were often small. Inherent to hypothesis testing with such large sample sizes, 295 even clinically irrelevant deviations can yield statistically significant differences. Importantly, inter-296 variable relationships were conserved in synthetic data: In univariable analyses both effect direction and 297 statistical significance was well captured by both generative models effectively enabling explorative 298 investigations in such data sets. 299\nOnce real data is obtained, privacy concerns often inhibit public access and thus impede data sharing 300 and third-party hypothesis testing. Frequently used practices range from de-identifying or anonymizing 301 data to more advanced computational approaches. De-identification or anonymization (e.g. removing 302 names and birth dates), as well as adding artificial noise to the original data have recently been proven 303 to be unsafe in terms of guarding privacy as reidentification attacks can successfully unveil patients\u2019 304 identity.(28\u201330) Computational advances in both federated(31) and swarm learning(32) where machine 305 learning models are trained across multiple locations and only either models or weights are shared rather 306 than the data itself provide a viable alternative. Nevertheless, these technologies are vulnerable to data 307 reconstructions, e.g. via data leakage from model gradients.(33\u201335) Inherent to synthetic data generation 308 in terms of privacy safeguards is a trade-off between usability and privacy where an increase in each 309 negatively affects the other.(36) Ideally, synthetic data should not be re-identifiable but at the same time 310 closely match the original distributions. Zero exact matches were observed in our synthetic cohorts. 311 Additionally, Hamming distances showed that reconstruction of original training samples is highly 312 unlikely given the number of variables per synthetic patient that would have to be altered in order to 313 match a training cohort patient. 314\nThe generation of synthetic data is, as all machine learning models are, fundamentally limited by the 315 data that the model is trained on. This implies that external users should be aware of the properties of 316\nthe training data that went into the generation of a synthetic data set in order to either select the right 317 data set for their research question or vice versa, adapt the research question to the available data. It is 318 therefore important to note, that patients in our trials have all been treated with intensive anthracycline-319 based therapy and largely stem from a Middle-European ethnic background. Hence, our generated 320 synthetic AML data sets may not fully capture features of other populations let alone other treatment 321 modalities, such as less intensive therapy or targeted agents. The incorporation of these modalities will 322 be addressed in future works. Since ML models thrive on large and diverse data sets, synthetic data 323 generation from medical records is caught in a paradoxical loop: Available data is sparse, synthetic data 324 can potentially accommodate for sparse available real data, synthetic data requires large and diverse sets 325 of real data to meaningfully represent the population.(37) Therefore, the generation of synthetic data is 326 likely more robust, if training data from large multicenter cohorts is used. Nonetheless, the availability 327 of synthetic data promises a democratization of clinical research. In similar efforts, Azizi et al.(38) and 328 D\u2019Amico et al.(39) explored synthetic data generation in cancer. Azizi et al.(38) used data from a 329 previously conducted clinical trial in colorectal cancer to generate synthetic data using conditional 330 decision trees. Focusing on myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS), D\u2019Amico et al.(39) used a conditional 331 Wasserstein tabular GAN to generate synthetic MDS patients from the GenoMed4All database. Both 332 groups conclude the feasibility of either method to generate synthetic data that closely resemble the 333 original data distributions and provide access to their synthetic data. Such studies may alleviate a 334 common gatekeeping mechanism of costly data collection efforts that are often restricted to large well-335 funded medical centers. Further, this also extends to cross-domain applications involving medical data, 336 e.g. the training of a ML model by a third party that requires large sets of training data. 337\nIn summary, we demonstrate the feasibility of two different technologies of generative AI to create 338 synthetic clinical trial data that both closely mimic disease biology and clinical behavior, as well as 339 conserve the privacy of patients in the training cohort. Generating such large synthetic data sets based 340 on multicenter clinical trial training data holds the promise of enabling a new kind of clinical research 341 improving upon data accessibility, while ameliorating current hindrances in data sharing. 342\n343\nAcknowledgements 344\nWe thank all contributing physicians, laboratories, and nurses associated with the German Study 345 Alliance Leukemia and especially participating patients for their valuable contributions. 346\n347\nAuthorship Contributions 348\nJ.-N.E., W.H., M.W., and J.M.M. designed the study.

Event-free survival 510 (EFS) deviated significantly from the original cohort for both synthetic cohorts (A). For the NFlow-511 generated cohort, there was no significant deviation from the original distribution for overall survival 512 (OS), while the CTAB-GAN+-generated cohort again differed significantly (B). Interestingly, while the 513 survival curve for CTAB-GAN+ displays a plausible curve up until ten years of follow-up, the curve 514 shows no stabilization of survival rates in the end as the original cohort does. Contrastingly, the survival 515 curve for NFlow shows an overall plausible course, however, NFlow tends to overtly censor patients 516 after two years of follow-up. 517"
