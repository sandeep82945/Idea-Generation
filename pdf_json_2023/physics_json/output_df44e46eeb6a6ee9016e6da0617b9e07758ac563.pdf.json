    "abstractText": "Staphylococcus aureus is a zoonotic opportunistic pathogen that represents a significant threat to public health. Previous studies have shown that tannic acid (TA) has an inhibitory effect on a variety of bacteria. In this study, the proteome and transcriptome of S. aureus were analyzed to comprehensively assess changes in genes and proteins induced by TA. Initial observations of morphological changes revealed that TA damaged the integrity of the cell membrane. Next, proteomic and genetic analyses showed that exposure to TA altered the expression levels of 651 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs, 283 upregulated and 368 downregulated) and 503 differentially expressed genes (DEGs, 191 upregulated and 312 downregulated). Analysis of the identified DEPs and DEGs suggested that TA damages the integrity of the cell envelope by decreasing the expression and protein abundance of enzymes involved in the synthesis of peptidoglycans, teichoic acids and fatty acids, such as murB, murQ, murG, fmhX and tagA. After treatment with TA, the assembly of ribosomes in S. aureus was severely impaired by significant reductions in available ribosome components, and thus protein synthesis was hindered. The levels of genes and proteins associated with amino acids and purine synthesis were remarkably decreased, which further reduced bacterial viability. In addition, ABC transporters, which are involved in amino acid and ion transport, were also badly affected. Our results reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of TA on S. aureus and provide a theoretical basis for the application of TA as an antibacterial chemotherapeutic agent.",

Previous studies have shown that tannic acid (TA) has an inhibitory effect on a variety of bacteria. In this study, the proteome and transcriptome of S. aureus were analyzed to comprehensively assess changes in genes and proteins induced by TA. Initial observations of morphological changes revealed that TA damaged the integrity of the cell membrane. Next, proteomic and genetic analyses showed that exposure to TA altered the expression levels of 651 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs, 283 upregulated and 368 downregulated) and 503 differentially expressed genes (DEGs, 191 upregulated and 312 downregulated). Analysis of the identified DEPs and DEGs suggested that TA damages the integrity of the cell envelope by decreasing the expression and protein abundance of enzymes involved in the synthesis of peptidoglycans, teichoic acids and fatty acids, such as murB, murQ, murG, fmhX and tagA. After treatment with TA, the assembly of ribosomes in S. aureus was severely impaired by significant reductions in available ribosome components, and thus protein synthesis was hindered. The levels of genes and proteins associated with amino acids and purine synthesis were remarkably decreased, which further reduced bacterial viability. In addition, ABC transporters, which are involved in amino acid and ion transport, were also badly affected. Our results reveal the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of TA on S. aureus and provide a theoretical basis for the application of TA as an antibacterial chemotherapeutic agent.\nKEYWORDS\nStaphylococcus aureus, tannic acid, proteome, transcriptome, antimicrobial mechanism\n1 Introduction\nStaphylococcus aureus is a widely distributed zoonotic opportunistic pathogen, as well as one of the most common food-borne diseases (Khanal et al., 2022). S. aureus usually causes mild skin or wound infections, and in severe cases, systemic infections such as sepsis (Woolhouse et al., 2015). S. aureus infection not only poses a threat to human health, but also causes severe economic losses to the animal husbandry industry. The most significant challenge facing the development of effective treatments for S. aureus infection is the rapid"

As a result of this characteristic of S. aureus, the development of new antimicrobial drugs lags far behind the emergence of resistant bacteria (Hutchings et al., 2019). Therefore, new antibacterial agents with activity against S. aureus are always urgently needed. However, in the past 50 years, only two synthetic antibiotics, fluoroquinolones and oxazolidinones, have been developed successfully (Lewis, 2013).\nGiven the successful development of drugs from natural products, such as lovastatin and reserpine, increasing attention has been paid to the therapeutic potential of natural products in recent years. Among such natural products, tannins are a group of polyphenols that are widely present in many types of trees and higher plants, such as green tea, coffee, and fruit species (Chung et al., 1998a). Over thousands of years, diverse tannin-containing plant species in China and across Asia, such as Galla chinensis, have been used as astringents to treat diarrhea and hemorrhage (Djakpo and Yao, 2010), as well as administered as anticarcinogens (Zhang et al., 2015; Gao et al., 2018) and antimicrobial agents (Chung et al., 1998a).\nTannic acid (TA, Figure 1) is the simplest hydrolysable tannin and is approved as a weakly acidic food additive by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) (Guo et al., 2021). It has attracted much attention in recent years due to its extensive physiological activities, which include antioxidant, antitumoral, antimicrobial and antiinflammatory actions, in addition to its ability to interact with proteins, as well as its potential in materials science and engineering applications (Guo et al., 2021). TA is composed of a core glucose molecule connected to 10 galloyl groups by aliphatic\nester bonds (Guo et al., 2021). A clinical study has shown that Cesinex\u00ae, a TA-based medical food, is effective against broadspectrum diarrhea and has a good safety profile (Ren et al., 2012).\nPrevious work revealed that TA has an inhibitory effect on a variety of bacteria, including S. aureus, Salmonella, and Lactobacillus (Taguri et al., 2004). More than that, TA could enhance the inhibitory effect of antibiotics such as erythromycin on drugresistant S. aureus through suppression the drug efflux pump (Tintino et al., 2016; Tintino et al., 2017). Chung et al. suggested that TA inhibited bacterial growth by chelating ions from the culture medium (Chung et al., 1998b). It has also been reported that TA inhibits bacterial growth by inhibiting fatty acid synthesis through suppression of the activity of \u03b2-ketoacyl-ACP reductase (Wu et al., 2010). Other research has indicated that TA binds directly to peptidoglycans (PGs) in the bacterial cell wall, interfering with cell wall integrity (Dong et al., 2018). However, the mechanisms underlying the inhibitory effect of TA on S. aureus have not been assessed comprehensively. Therefore, the present study combined transcriptome and proteome data to analyze the molecular mechanisms of TA in S. aureus and identify potential targets for the development of new therapeutic agents from natural sources."

A total of 1900 proteins were identified in S. aureus in this study. Differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were defined as follows: fold change (FC) > 1.20 or <0.87 and p < 0.05. The comparison of control and TA-treated S. aureus revealed 651 significant DEPs (283 upregulated proteins and 368 downregulated proteins).

The enzymes involved in the PG synthesis pathway are targets of many clinically used antibiotics, such as vancomycin and \u03b2lactam antibiotics (Hua et al., 2019). Previous experiments on methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) suggest that TA might interfere with cell membrane integrity and inhibit the formation of\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org10\nMRSA biofilm, but the mechanism underlying these effects was not reported (Dong et al., 2018). Our microscopy assays showed that direct exposure to TA shrank the outermost cell wall of S. aureus and disrupted cell membrane integrity. The expression levels of several proteins related to PG synthesis in S. aureuswere significantly decreased after TA treatment, including UDP-N-acetylmuramate dehydrogenase (murB), type 1 glutamine amidotransferase, peptidoglycan interpeptide bridge formation enzyme (fmhX/fmhB) and undecaprenyl diphosphomuramoyl pentapeptide beta-N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase (murG) (Table 1). MurB catalyzes the final step in the formation of UDP-Nacetylteichoic acid (UDP-MurNAc), which can act as an essential catalyst in the presence of NADPH to catalyze enolpyruvyl UDP-Nacetylglucosamine to UDP-MurNAc (Winstel et al., 2014). We also found that N-acetylmuramic acid 6-phosphate etherase (murQ), a transcriptional regulator of MurNAc-6p in S. aureus, was significantly downregulated at the protein level (Curiel et al., 2011; Gould, 2018). MurG belongs to the glycosyltransferase family and connects the GlcNAc of UDP-GlcNAc to lipid I after MraY catalysis and lipid II production (Hua et al., 2019). MurG and other glycosyltransferases are known to be involved in the synthesis of teichoic acids. In the present study, several glycosyltransferases were significantly downregulated at the protein level in the TA treatment group, includingmurG, tagA, and B4602_RS03245 (Figure 10) (Zhang et al., 2021).\nGlcNAc, N-acetylglucosamine; MurNAc, N-acetylmuramic acid, ManNAc: N-acetylmannosamine; Und-P, Undcaprenyl\nphosphate; MurB, UDP-N-acetyl allylacetone glucosamine reductase; MurG, undecaprenyl diphospho-muramoyl pentapeptide beta-N-acetylglucosaminyl transferase; MraY, UDPMurNAc-pentapeptide phosphotransferase; PBP, penicillin-binding proteins; FmhX/FemX, type 1 glutamine amidotransferase; TagA, glycosyltransferase catalyze the first step of wall teichoic acid synthesis.\nAs important components of cell membranes, fatty acids play a very important role in maintaining cell architecture and permeability (Adnan et al., 2017). Three key enzymes involved in fatty acid biosynthesis were significantly downregulated at the protein level in the TA treatment group: acetyl-CoA carboxylase biotin carboxylase subunit (accC1), acetyl-CoA carboxylase biotin carboxyl carrier protein subunit (BCCP) and purK. TA has been shown in previous studies to inhibit b-ketoacyl-ACP reductase (FabG) in the fatty acid synthesis pathway, but the results of this study did not confirm this finding (Wu et al., 2010). In this study, FabG was slightly downregulated at the gene level and showed no significant change at the protein level. In contrast with our findings, others have reported that TA can affect the cell wall integrity of Lactobacillus plantarum by increasing the synthesis of three proteins associated with cell wall synthesis (Akanuma et al., 2014). Our finding that TA exposure significantly decreased the protein and/or gene levels of enzymes associated with the PG synthesis and fatty acid synthesis pathways suggests that TA can affect the integrity of the cell envelope.\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org11"

Ribosomes are also crucial targets for many antibiotics, and about 60% of approved antibiotics work by targeting them (Suzuki et al., 2014). Previous transcriptomic studies have shown that tannins purified from Phyllanthus columnaris stem bark affect MRSA growth mainly by inhibiting the ribosome pathway, disrupting the translation process and inhibiting protein synthesis (Wilson, 2014). Bacterial ribosomes are composed of the 50s subunit and the 30s subunit; the 50s subunit is composed of 23s and 5s RNA andmore than 30 proteins. TA treatment can significantly reduce the protein content or gene expression level of various proteins that compose the S. aureus 50S and 30S ribosome subunits, such as 50S ribosomal proteins L34, L36, and L16, among others (Table 1). These ribosomal proteins play an important role in 70s ribosome assembly. The 50s ribosome protein L34 (rpmH) is required for efficient 70s ribosome formation. A previous study reported a significant reduction in the binding affinity of 50S ribosome protein L16 (rplP) due to a lack of L34 in the \u0394rpmH defect strain, leading to conformational changes in the 50S subunit (Li et al., 2015). Another study found that a mutation in ribosomal protein L2 (rplB) not only reduced the efficiency of formation of the 70S ribosome, but also induced a deficiency of L16 in the 50S subunit (Usachev et al., 2020). We also found that the protein level of translation initiation factor IF-2 (infB), which is involved in regulating the efficiency and fidelity of the formation of translation-initiation complexes, was significantly reduced by TA exposure (Suzuki et al., 2014; Zallot et al., 2017).\nMoreover, the protein levels of both ribosome silencing factor (rsfS) and ribosome-associated translation inhibitor (raiA) were significantly increased by TA treatment. RsfS can inhibit\ntranslation by directly binding to the L14 protein on the Mycobacterium tuberculosis 50S ribosome to prevent the formation of the 70S initiating complex (Thoden et al., 2004). RaiA can interact with the 70S and 30S ribosome subunits and suppress translation initiation in Escherichia coli (Yin et al., 1998). In addition, TA treatment also significantly decreased the expression levels of enzymes associated with tRNA amino acid transport, such as serine-tRNA ligase (serS), cys-tRNA (Pro) deacylase (ybaK), and epoxyqueuosine reductase (queH) (Huo and Viola, 1996). These results indicate that S. aureus slow their metabolism and reduce the intensity of protein synthesis in response to TA stress."

The formation of carbamoyl phosphate catalyzed by carbamoyl phosphate synthetase yields an important form of inorganic nitrogen that can be utilized by microorganisms and also plays an important role in the biosynthesis of pyrimidine and arginine. Carbamoyl phosphate synthetase and glutamine synthetase (GlnA) are both important enzymes that catalyze the conversion of ammonia into organic nitrogen. The large and small subunits carB and carA, which constitute carbamoyl phosphate synthetase, were significantly downregulated at the protein and transcript levels (Xu and Grant, 2013). GlnA catalyzes the formation of L-glutamate into L-glutamine, and both of these molecules are important intermediates in the synthesis of tryptophan, histidine and other amino acids (Koenigsknecht et al., 2007). GlnA protein and gene levels were\nFIGURE 10 TA target the PG synthesis of S. aureus.\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org12\nsignificantly reduced, which indicated that TA treatment affected amino acid and purine synthesis in S. aureus. Homoserine kinase (ThrB), which catalyzes the conversion of L-homoserine to L-homoserine phosphate, is an enzyme in the aspartate pathway involved in the synthesis of threonine and isoleucine (Morar et al., 2006). Bifunctional threonine ammonia-lyase/L-serine ammonia-lyase (TdcB) catalyzes L-threonine to form intermediate product 2-oxobutanoate of the L-isoleucine synthesis pathway. The protein and gene levels of thrB and tdcB were both reduced significantly (Mishima et al., 2001).\nThe carbon and nitrogen in the purine ring skeleton are mainly provided by aspartic acid, glutamine and glycine, so the synthesis of purine nucleotides is closely related to the anabolism of amino acids. Amidophosphoribosyl transferase (PurF), phosphoribosylformylglycinamidine synthase I (PurQ), adenylosuccinate synthase (B4602_RS00095), phosphoribosylglycinamide formyltransferase (PurN) and adenylosuccinate lyase (PurB) are enzymes involved in the hypoxanthine nucleotide and adenine nucleotide synthesis pathways (Table 1). PurF catalyzes the formation of phosphoribosylamine from phosphoribosylpyrophosphate (PRPP) and glutamine (Cui and Davidson, 2011). PurQ catalyzes the ATPdependent conversion of formylglycinamide ribonucleotide (FGAR) and glutamine to yield formylglycinamidine ribonucleotide (FGAM) and glutamate (Orelle et al., 2019). The protein and transcript levels of each of the amino acid anabolism-related enzymes mentioned above were decreased significantly by exposure to TA. These results suggest that treatment of S. aureus with TA decreased levels of amino acids, especially L-glutamine, threonine, and isoleucine, as well as purine synthesis, inhibiting bacterial growth. Moreover, increased expression of pruA, lpdA, and B4602_RS00640, which are involved in valine, leucine, isoleucine and lysine degradation, demonstrated that the amino acid metabolism of S. aureus accelerated significantly after TA treatment."

Our analyses revealed upregulation of OppD, OppF and branchedchain amino acid transporter (B4602_RS11480) proteins, and downregulation of HisM and GmpC proteins, which indicated that amino acid transportation was disrupted by TA. Bacteria accumulate stress-relieving compounds such as betaine, choline, and carnitine via ABC transporters in response to increased external osmolarity by balancing the osmotic gradient across the cytoplasmic membrane\n(Grigg et al., 2010). opuBB, opuCC and opuBA, which encode the extracellular substrate-binding region of the ABC-type glycine betaine transport system (Lawrence et al., 1998), were significantly downregulated at the protein level after TA treatment. These findings suggest that TA may affect osmotic pressure by inhibiting the glycine betaine transport system.\nIron, which is a key molecule involved in cytochrome formation, resistance to reactive oxygen species and other molecular functions, is an essential nutrient for most living bacteria. S. aureus expresses a set of transport proteins that are devoted to the acquisition of several forms of iron (e.g., Fe2+, Fe3+-siderophore, and heme) from the environment (Durgadevi et al., 2020). We found that SirA, a lipoprotein in staphyloferrin B with high affinity and high specificity (Rapun-Araiz et al., 2020), was significantly upregulated. The transporters known to mediate uptake of iron (isdF, fepC), ferric citrate (fecB, fecCD) and other inorganic ions were significantly elevated at the protein and transcript levels, with the exception of psaA (Table 1). PsaA is likely to be a Mn2+ binding protein and has been identified as an essential virulence factor in a mouse model (Bleul et al., 2021). Our results are consistent with a previous report showing that TA upregulated heme- and iron-related ABC transporter proteins in Proteus mirabilis (Wilde et al., 2015). Previous studies have suggested that TA may chelate iron from the medium to render it unavailable to microorganisms (Chung et al., 1998b). S. aureus probably meet their iron needs by up-regulating transporters involved in iron uptake, and these transporters, which are also involved in sugar transport (ugpA, ugpC), phosphonate transport (phnD, phnE), the lipoprotein export system (lolD), and cell envelope biogenesis, were significantly downregulated after TA treatment (Table 1). Taken together, our results suggest that the primary bacteriostatic mechanism of TA is disruption of transport systems related to iron and amino acid uptake, which impairs protein synthesis and destroys cell membranes."

            "text": "Two-component signal transduction systems (TCS), which are widely found in prokaryotic bacteria, are the main mechanism utilized by bacteria to regulate metabolism in response to environmental changes or cope with stress factors such as antibiotics (Qiu et al., 2021). S. aureus encodes 16 TCSs to sense and adapt to environmental changes primarily by regulating the expression of virulence genes (Pietiainen et al., 2009). The staphylococcal respiratory response (SrrAB) system regulates the expression of genes involved in anaerobic metabolism, nitrosative stress, and cytochrome biosynthesis (Sass et al., 2008). TA treatment significantly reduced the protein levels of SrrA and SrrB in S. aureus, but their gene expression levels were not significantly reduced, suggesting that TA may impair cytochrome biosynthesis and decrease resistance to nitrosative stress (Popella et al., 2016) (Table 1).\nTA treatment has been shown to inhibit some TCS elements associated with bacterial resistance to antibiotics at the protein and transcript levels. For example, the two-component ABC transporter VraDE is involved in the regulation of antimicrobial peptide resistance against bacitracin and human beta-defensin 3 as a downstream signal of the GraRS system (Yang et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2017; Li et al., 2019). The activation of GraRS also induces\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org13\nexpression of the resistance factor protein DltABDCX, which contributed to the net positive surface charge by covalently incorporating D-alanine into cell wall teichoic acids (Hua et al., 2018). In this study, TA significantly decreased the protein and mRNA levels of vraDE and vraF, as well as the mRNA content of dltABDC, in S. aureus (1.56-2.32 log2(FC), data not shown), indicating that the cell envelope was damaged. TA can also significantly inhibit the transcription and translation of uhpT and glpT, which encode the glucose 6-phosphate transporter and glycerol-3-phosphate transporter of S. aureus, to enhance fosfomycin resistance (Wu et al., 2019)."

            "text": "In this study, transcriptome and proteome data were combined to discover the antibacterial mechanism of TA against S. aureus for the first time. The antibacterial mechanism of TA was mainly attributed to destruction of the cell envelope as a result of its inhibitory effects on the production of PGs, teichoic acids and lipids, as well as inhibition of ribosome formation and disruption of protein synthesis and amino acid biosynthesis. We speculate that the main mechanism of TA is depression of cell envelope synthesis and ribosome formation, and related mechanisms will be further explored in future studies."
