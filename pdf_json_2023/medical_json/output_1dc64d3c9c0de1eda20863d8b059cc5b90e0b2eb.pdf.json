A reference system combin\u2011 ing inertial modules with distance sensors and pressure insoles was used for comparison of DMOs from the single wearable device. We assessed and validated three algorithms for gait sequence detection, four for ICD, three for CAD and four for SL by concurrently comparing their performances (e.g., accuracy, specificity, sensitivity, absolute and relative errors). Additionally, the effects of walking bout (WB) speed and duration on algorithm performance were investigated.\nResults We identified two cohort\u2011specific top performing algorithms for gait sequence detection and CAD, and a sin\u2011 gle best for ICD and SL. Best gait sequence detection algorithms showed good performances (sensitivity > 0.73, posi\u2011 tive predictive values > 0.75, specificity > 0.95, accuracy > 0.94). ICD and CAD algorithms presented excellent results, with sensitivity > 0.79, positive predictive values > 0.89 and relative errors < 11% for ICD and < 8.5% for CAD. The best\n*Correspondence: Silvia Del Din silvia.del\u2011din@ncl.ac.uk Full list of author information is available at the end of the article\nidentified SL algorithm showed lower performances than other DMOs (absolute error < 0.21 m). Lower performances across all DMOs were found for the cohort with most severe gait impairments (proximal femoral fracture).\nAlgorithms\u2019 performances were lower for short walking bouts; slower gait speeds (< 0.5 m/s) resulted in reduced per\u2011 formance of the CAD and SL algorithms.\nConclusions Overall, the identified algorithms enabled a robust estimation of key DMOs. Our findings showed that the choice of algorithm for estimation of gait sequence detection and CAD should be cohort\u2011specific (e.g., slow walkers and with gait impairments). Short walking bout length and slow walking speed worsened algorithms\u2019 performances.\nTrial registration ISRCTN \u2013 12246987.\nKeywords Real\u2011world gait, Algorithms, DMOs, Validation, Wearable sensor, Walking, Cadence, SL, Digital health, Accelerometer"

            "text": "The adverse consequences of physical mobility loss and the importance of preserving mobility to ensure healthy ageing are undeniable [1, 2]. For this reason, a variety of behavioural, nutritional, and pharmacological interventions aim to improve mobility in general, and more specifically target the preservation of an individual\u2019s ability to walk independently and safely both within and outside their homes [3\u20136]. Evaluating the effectiveness of interventions by quantifying an improved gait pattern, however, remains a challenge when relying on traditional tools such as patient-reported outcomes or supervised gait tests in clinic or lab, as these typically lack ecological validity [7].\nTherefore, there is a need for the development of accurate, reliable, and sensitive tools for the quantification of gait and mobility in real-life [8, 9]. Digital health technology, including body-worn or wearable devices, offers a way forward by providing digital outcomes to remotely measure and monitor gait [10, 11], a fundamental component of mobility [12, 13]. Nonetheless, due to several persisting challenges in this field, current tools and techniques are still in their infancy. These challenges need to be addressed before digital mobility outcomes can be confidently adopted in clinical trials and as part of standard healthcare, including a variety of technical, clinical, and regulatory aspects [9, 14].\nExciting technical advances in algorithms and data processing techniques have led to the deployment of a plethora of algorithms to extract digital mobility outcomes from gait data recorded using inertial measurement units embedded within wearable devices [15\u201317]. Even so, significant ongoing challenges exist, in particular establishing the technical validity of these algorithms. A thorough validation process must account for complex factors that simultaneously arise from multiple sources influencing digital mobility outcome measures, including disease characteristics, patient specific habits, and\nthe context in which walking is recorded (i.e. indoors, outdoors, public vs. private domain) [18\u201320]. All these factors concur to potentially limit the generalizability of validation data recorded during traditional gait protocols such as those administered within a controlled clinical or laboratory setting in which participants are asked to walk along a straight path or just a few daily life activities are simulated [21, 22]. Only recently, ad-hoc wearable devices have been developed, which finally allow moving the validation to more complex and realistic real-life scenarios [19, 23]. However, published validation studies generally only target a subset of specific digital mobility outcomes as calculated from one or a reduced number of algorithms and/or include only a few cohorts, hence providing partial information about generalizability of the results [22, 24].\nThe aim of this paper is to identify, compare and rank the most promising algorithms that quantitatively characterize gait with digital mobility outcomes from continuous real-life monitoring in a diverse group of patients who present with different mobility challenges. Here we focus on detection of gait sequences (i.e., identified walking bouts), individual steps, and estimation of cadence and stride length from a single wearable device positioned on the lower back, an ergonomically easy-to-use position near the centre of mass, which is well accepted by participants [25, 26]. To establish generalizability, we independently compare algorithms in six cohorts: healthy older adults, Parkinson\u2019s disease, multiple sclerosis, proximal femoral fracture, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and congestive heart failure. Specifically, we aim to:\n(a) Identify, compare and rank the best performing (i.e., most accurate and reliable) algorithms for each cohort; (b) Describe the performance of the identified best algorithms;\n(c) Analyse the influence of walking speed and walking bout duration on the algorithm performance; (d) Provide recommendations to implement and select algorithms for real-world gait analysis tailored to different patient cohorts."

            "text": "Participants were monitored for 2.5\u00a0 h as they went about their usual activities in their habitual environment (home/work/community/outdoor). To ensure diversity of walking activity, participants were also asked to perform some specific tasks: outdoor walking; walking up and down a slope and stairs; and moving from one room to another. Participants wore a single McRoberts Dynaport MM+ wearable device (sampling frequency 100\u00a0Hz, triaxial acceleration range: \u00b1 8\u00a0 g/resolution: 1\u00a0 mg, triaxial gyroscope range: \u00b1 2000 degrees per second (dps)/ resolution: 70 mdps), secured to the lower back with an elasticated belt and Velcro fastening. A reference system was used to establish the accuracy of algorithms and was comprised of a multicomponent system of INertial modules, DIstance Sensors and Pressure insoles (INDIP) [19, 23, 27]. The INDIP system and the associated algorithms to estimate digital mobility outcomes have been validated in previous studies in healthy and pathological cohorts (e.g., hemiparetic, Parkinson\u2019s disease, Huntington\u2019s\ndisease and mild cognitive impairment) and in this study participants [23, 28\u201332]. The INDIP and the single wearable device on the lower back were synchronized using timestamps referred to a common clock [19].\nPre\u2011selection of\u00a0algorithms for\u00a0further validation and\u00a0ranking In this paper we focused on key metrics of real-world walking that form the basis from which a variety of digital mobility outcomes, including walking speed, can then be quantified. These are: gait sequence detection, foot initial contact detection, cadence and stride length estimation. For each metric, we identified published algorithms from laboratory-based or semi-structured protocols [8, 33]. This yielded 14 for gait sequence detection, 21 for initial contact detection, 23 for cadence and 18 for stride length estimation. For each digital mobility outcome, a shortlist of up to four most promising algorithms was selected based on initial testing in pre-existing data from older adults and pathological cohorts, including Parkinson\u2019s disease [28, 34\u201336], multiple sclerosis [37, 38], stroke & chorea [28, 39]. Algorithms\u2019 selection was based on the ranking methodology proposed in Bonci et\u00a0al. [24]. The final subset of optimized algorithms (including detailed descriptions of implementation) are summarized in Table\u00a01 and briefly outlined below.\nGait sequence detection (GSD) This metric identifies sections of the raw signal which correspond to walking/ gait. Three algorithms were selected: GSDA [40], GSDB [16] and GSDC [41].\nInitial contact detection (ICD) This metric detects the foot initial contact within each gait sequence. Four algorithms were selected: ICDA [16, 41, 42], ICDB [44], ICDC [16, 41, 42] and ICDD [45].\nCadence estimation (CAD) This metric identifies strides as a cyclic pattern from which cadence [number of steps within a minute (min)] is estimated in each walking bout [17]. Three algorithms were selected: CADA [41, 42, 44], CADB [16, 46] and CADC [17, 45].

Four algorithms were selected based either on biomechanical or machinelearning models: SLA [47, 48], SLB [47, 48], SLC [49, 50] and SLD [17, 51].\nData and\u00a0statistical analyses for\u00a0validation and\u00a0ranking of\u00a0algorithms. All calculations and statistical analysis were performed using Matlab\u00ae R2021a (Mathworks, Natick, MA).\nPerformance measures to\u00a0describe and\u00a0establish algorithm validity To ensure objective comparison between systems (INDIP and wearable device), walking bouts detected by the INDIP were given as a standardized input to all algorithms except for gait sequence detection where the full wearable device recording was given as input. A walking bout was defined as a walking sequence containing at least two consecutive strides of both feet (e.g., R\u2013L\u2013R\u2013 L\u2013R\u2013L or L\u2013R\u2013L\u2013R\u2013L\u2013R, with R/L being the right/left foot contact with the ground) [18]. Criteria for inclusion of a stride were: (a) duration of 0.2\u20133\u00a0s, and (b) a minimum length of 0.15\u00a0m. A resting period/break of 3\u00a0 s or more identified consecutive walking bouts [18], thus each walking bout could include resting periods/breaks \u2264 3\u00a0 s. Each metric was determined by the algorithms implemented on the single wearable device and by the INDIP.\nAlgorithm validation was established independently for each cohort by comparing digital mobility outcomes obtained from the selected algorithms applied to the wearable device with those from the INDIP using the following set of performance measures to describe and establish validity:\nwhere TP = True Positive events, TN = True Negative events, FP: False Positive events, FN: False Negative events.\n(3)Accuracy = TP + TN\nTN + TP + FN + FP\n(4)Sensitivity = TP\nTP + FN\n(5)Specificity = TN\nTN + FP\n(6)Positive Predictive Value = TP\nTP + FP\n\u2022 Intra class correlation coefficient (ICC(2,1)) [52] was calculated to assess the association between the digital mobility outcomes of the two systems using all walking bouts collected from each cohort separately. Based on ICC estimates, values less than 0.5, between 0.5 and 0.75, between 0.75 and 0.9, and greater than 0.9 were deemed to be indicative of poor, moderate, good, and excellent agreement, respectively [53]. \u2022 Absolute agreement was assessed by quantifying (i) absolute error, (ii) bias, and (iii) Limits of Agreement [54] between the wearable device and reference system digital mobility outcomes calculated for each walking bout. \u2022 Relative errors between the wearable device and INDIP digital mobility outcomes were determined for each walking bout.\nMean and 95% confidence intervals of all digital mobility outcomes were evaluated at a cohort level (i.e., quantified using all walking bouts across all participants belonging to that specific cohort). Subsets of relevant measures were then used for the different digital mobility outcomes and evaluated as detailed below.\nFor gait sequence detection algorithms, each window of 0.1\u00a0 s from the complete 2.5-h recording was classified (see Fig.\u00a01) as either true positive, false positive, true negative or false negative and accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value were calculated. These measures were evaluated for each 2.5-h assessment. In addition, absolute errors and ICC(2,1) for the total accumulated duration of all gait sequences identified in a 2.5-h recording was assessed and compared between the two systems, for each participant.\nIn the case of initial contact detection, we defined each initial contact event within a walking bout as a true positive, false positive and false negative by comparing the initial contact events detected by the wearable device to the events detected by the INDIP within a tolerance window of 0.5\u00a0s (centred around the event identified by the INDIP, see Fig.\u00a02), representative of a step duration [55]. This approach has been previously used and was adopted to take into account the potential mismatch on the event time between the INDIP and the wearable device [56]. To assess initial contact detection, true negative events were not evaluated, since true negative would correspond to all non-initial contact events identified as such by both systems.\nFor initial contact detection, we utilised the following measures: sensitivity, positive predictive values, absolute errors (which were estimated for each true positive initial contact (see Fig.\u00a02)) and relative error (estimated by dividing all absolute errors, within a walking bout, by the average step duration estimated by the INDIP [55]).\nFor cadence and stride length algorithms, the measures used were: relative errors, absolute errors and ICC(2,1).\nRanking algorithms using performance measures A simplified version of the ranking methodology described in Bonci et\u00a0 al. [24] was applied to compare algorithm performance using a decision matrix. This was based on the weighted combination of performance measures described above assessing agreement between the single wearable device and the INDIP system (classified as benefit or cost). Performance measures considered as benefits were: accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and ICC(2,1) [52]. Performance measures considered as costs were absolute and relative errors.\nEach measure was weighted based on its relative importance to the algorithm\u2019s validity assessment (see Bonci et\u00a0al. [24] and Additional file\u00a01 for further detail regarding the specific performance measures and assigned weights for gait sequence detection, initial contact detection, cadence and stride length algorithms). This information was combined to determine a performance index (0 = worst, 1 = best), calculated as a weighted mean of the selected benefit and/or cost analysis, which was subsequently used to compare and rank the algorithm performances, and thus, to select the top performing algorithms for each cohort independently."

Specifically, median relative errors for each digital mobility outcome were quantified evaluating all the walking bouts\ncharacterized by specific walking speed and walking bout duration ranges; including errors observed in consecutive walking speed windows of 0.05\u00a0m/s [57] and in consecutive walking bout duration windows of 2\u00a0s. For each digital mobility outcome, the resulting median errors were then employed in a best-fit approach to determine their association between the relative errors and walking speed or walking bout duration, respectively. In the best-fit approach, median error values were also weighted according to the relevant number of observations in a given window with respect to the total number of observations."

Overall, higher errors (> 50%) were observed only in the 0.9% of the detected walking bouts; these bouts were characterised by a short duration (8.37 \u00b1 4.71\u00a0s) and slow walking speed (0.44 \u00b1 0.24\u00a0m/s)."

The absolute error ranged from 5.2 to 9.3 steps/min, the relative error between 6.6% to 11.8% and ICC(2,1) ranged from 0.44 to 0.82 across the three algorithms.\nThe highest absolute and relative errors, and the lowest ICC(2,1) were found for the proximal femoral fracture cohort. CADC had the highest performance index for healthy older adults (0.653), congestive heart failure (0.720), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (0.693), multiple sclerosis (0.644), Parkinson\u2019s disease (0.653). CADB presented the best performances for proximal femoral fracture (0.584) showing the lowest absolute error (7.2 steps/min), closest largest limits of agreement (\u2212\u00a0 10.1 to 24.2 steps/min), lowest relative error (8.5%) and highest ICC(2,1) (0.66).

This is encouraging, as gait analysis relies on high specificity, which corresponds to a correct identification of gait sequences (high number of true positive events) while avoiding the misidentification of gait sequences (low number of false positive events). Avoiding incorrect identification of gait-sequences (as also reflected by positive predictive values) is preferable, to avoid the extraction of digital mobility outcomes from activities which are not directly representative of gait, such as shuffling or transitions [59].\nWhen considering differences between algorithms, GSDA and GSDB tended to overestimate the total walking time (total gait sequence duration). This could potentially relate to different signal characteristics between the compared systems (low-back signals recorded with the wearable device may be different from feet signals [55] recorded with the INDIP). Slow gait, curved paths and short walking bouts with insufficient steady-pace phases for the spectral analysis could have also influenced the results, as the characteristics of the signals are more variable and the periods are less uniform than in steady-pace gait undertaken at faster speeds along straight paths [41].\nBased on our findings collectively, we recommend using GSDB on cohorts with slower gait speeds and substantial gait impairments (e.g., proximal femoral fracture). This may be because this algorithm is based on the\nacceleration norm (overall accelerometry signal rather than a specific axis/direction (e.g., vertical), hence it is more robust to sensor misalignments that are common in unsupervised real-life settings [41]. Moreover, the use of adaptive thresholds, that are derived from the features of a subject\u2019s data and applied to the amplitude of acceleration norm and to step duration for detection of steps belonging to gait sequences, allows increased robustness of the algorithm to irregular and unstable gait patterns. GSDA algorithm may be more suitable for cohorts with a faster gait speed and regular gait pattern (e.g., healthy older adults). This algorithm is based on a convolutional transformation (based on a gait cycle) of a single axis signal [40], potentially justifying its suitability to conditions characterised by more stable and regular gait patterns."

            "text": "Overall, all algorithms investigated for initial contact detection presented excellent sensitivity and positive predictive values (all above 0.81) and relative errors below 21% in diverse cohorts of patients. These errors are in line with previous work, although slightly higher than those assessed in laboratory or controlled and supervised environments, ranging between 4 and 13% [28, 39, 55]. Positive predictive values resulted were larger than sensitivity (although sensitivity values were > 0.75). This could be due to a lower number of false positive events (wrongly identified initial contact events) with respect to true positive events; slightly lower sensitivity measures reflect a higher number of missed initial contact events. Similar to gait sequence detection, higher positive predictive values (higher numbers of correctly identified initial contacts) are preferable, as gait assessment based on incorrectly identified events could lead to invalid digital mobility outcome extraction and misleading clinical interpretation. Low relative errors (< 11%), found for ICDA and ICDC, for step duration across all cohorts based on similar approaches are very encouraging and concurs with previous work which reported errors between 4 and 13% from data collected in laboratory conditions [39, 60]."

In addition, step detection can be used to refine the identification of gait sequences [41], and thus, the definition of a walking bout, which highlights the importance of using a robust algorithm with high sensitivity and positive predictive value. For all cohorts, we recommend the use of the ICDA for the identification of initial contact events, given the lowest absolute and relative errors (both in mean and standard deviation of step duration and initial contact time event) and best performance indexes. ICDA is an optimized implementation of the algorithm based on continuous wavelet transform and peak detection originally presented in [42], and is frequently used and reported in the literature for heel-strike or initial time contact event detection [39, 61]. This algorithm has been previously validated under different conditions,"

            "heading": "Cadence estimation",
            "text": "The excellent performances of cadence algorithms, reflected by low relative errors of < 12%, were in line with [17, 41, 45], or lower than previous results reported in the literature (13\u201314%) [16]. As based upon [53], moderate to excellent ICC(2,1) (> 0.70) were found in all cohorts except proximal femoral fracture, for the CADB and CADC algorithms. These results confirm the robustness of cadence estimation in all cohorts. Proximal femoral fracture data showed the lowest ICC(2,1) values but good performances for the other metrics. This may be partially explained by the high asymmetry and the slow speed that characterize the proximal femoral fracture cohort (all proximal femoral fracture patients walked at a speed of < 1.29\u00a0m/s) [62]. This and the use of walking aids may have impacted the wearable device signal quality (amplitude and shape) and hence challenged the processing techniques on which the algorithms are based (i.e., wavelet transformations for CADA and CADB [41, 42], and zero-crossings for CADC [45]).\nThe recommended algorithm for cadence estimation is dependent upon the mobility function of the cohort. Overall, CADC performances were excellent across all cohorts, especially for groups with higher gait speeds. CADB was more robust in the proximal femoral fracture cohort as reflected by the performance index. Therefore, we suggest the implementation of CADB in cohorts with compromised gait speed and symmetry (e.g., severe or advanced neurological diseases) for which a zero-crossing approach may not be so suitable.\nIt is worth mentioning that the methodology for initial contact events/step detection, used by initial contact detection and cadence algorithms, includes two main stages. The first is related to the processing of the wearable device acceleration signal in order to remove noise, artefacts and to enhance the step-related features (e.g., zero-phase low-pass filtering, detrending). Then, on the processed acceleration signal, the initial contacts/ steps are detected using peak detection or zero-crossing approaches. The combination of the various techniques for these two stages allowed us to implement optimized versions of state-of-the art algorithms.\nAlthough initial contact detection and cadence algorithms are based on similar approaches, our results are in\nline with previous findings showing that the use of a peak detection approach may be more suitable for identification of events (initial contact detection), whereas zerocrossing techniques result in more accurate identification of cyclic events and step segmentation, required for the cadence estimation. All in all, as observed by Panebianco et\u00a0 al. [61], this underlines that each principle is better tailored to each digital mobility outcome; i.e., a wavelet transformation with peak detection is better suited for initial contact detection, whereas the zero-crossing approach seems better suited for the cadence."

            "heading": "Stride length estimation",
            "text": "The performances of the stride length metrics are lower with respect to the other metrics presented in this work (e.g. cadence, initial contact detection), as reflected by relatively high absolute and relative errors, and low ICC(2,1). This could be due to the nature of the lower-back accelerometry signals recorded in real-world conditions, from which the stride length is calculated. Particularly, the estimation of the position of the centre of mass (by double integration of the acceleration) and the inverted pendulum models on which stride length algorithms are based, assumes straight walking trajectories. Moreover these methodological principles do not consider turns or non-straight walking trajectories (i.e. veering). All of these deviations from a purely symmetrical and straight walking pattern are frequently found in real-world recordings [36].\nAmong the four algorithms, our recommendation is to use SLA in all cohorts, given the lowest absolute, relative error and highest ICC(2,1), as summarized by the performance indexes. It must be noted that SLB was the best performer for the multiple sclerosis cohort, which is based on the same algorithm principle as SLA, but using a different correction factor implemented to estimate stride length [48]. All in all, SLA showed good performance and similar to SLB also for multiple sclerosis.\nIn general stride length algorithms tended to overestimate stride length between 0.07 and 0.16\u00a0 m, this could be due to the correction factors that are implemented in both SLA and SLB [17]. Overall, the results highlight the better suitability of biomechanically-based algorithms, rather than those based solely upon machine-learning approaches. This is in line with the results observed on a previous study which implemented the same algorithms, trained on the same pre-available datasets [17]. This could be due to the fact that the biomechanicallybased algorithms are less dependent on the intensity and morphology of the acceleration signals, and are highly influenced by the gait speed and irregularity of the gait patterns [17], which highlights a potential limitation in the generalization of the machine-learning based\nmodels when applied to external datasets. Future and novel machine-learning/deep-learning based models based on bigger datasets might produce better results.\nThe protocol used in the present study covered a comprehensive range of real-world scenarios. As such, results showed higher errors than those reported in previous studies: almost double with respect to [28] where results were evaluated from sensors on the shanks, and similar to [17] showing root mean square error between 0.04 and 0.18\u00a0 m, where data was collected in the laboratory. This could potentially be due to the additional challenges involved in real-world and uncontrolled gait assessments presented in the current study, and the use of different data, i.e., based on a wearable device and on a different reference system for comparison. Moreover, to ensure a fair comparison of the algorithms, the walking bout (input) on which the algorithms were applied was defined and \u201cimposed\u201d by the reference system (INDIP). This could have potentially led to higher errors stemming from applying the algorithms to a wearable device signal with reduced amplitude and noisier characteristics with respect to the signal identified by the INDIP (sensors on the feet), especially for short and slow walking bout. All in all, our results highlight that future studies should focus on the development and optimization of stride length algorithms for increasing robustness of stride length estimation in order for this to be a useful (i.e., sensitive to change) digital mobility outcome that could be used in clinical interventional studies.\nEffect of\u00a0walking speed and\u00a0walking bout duration on\u00a0algorithms\u2019 performances Generally, the performances of all algorithms significantly worsened for walking speeds below 0.5\u00a0m/s, which is considered as a threshold between slow and medium speed walkers [2], confirming what is well established in the literature [17, 63, 64]. This may be explained by the fact that the signals recorded with the wearable device in slow walkers are characterized by a compromised amplitude, non-uniform gait cycles [64, 65], and variable and irregular gait patterns [17]. Likewise, the lowest performances observed within proximal femoral fracture, may be explained by the lower speed and irregular gait patterns of this cohort [62]. Accordingly, the choice of algorithms for digital mobility outcome extraction should consider its sensitivity to gait speed, given its proven confounding effect on gait analysis [66], and the population of interest.\nWalking bout duration also significantly affected the performances of the cadence algorithms, with an overall significant reduction of the relative error observed for longer walking bouts when estimating both step duration and cadence. This trend was also likely magnified by the\nfact that the shortest bouts were also the slowest ones and confirms similar previous results [34]. This could also be due to the fact that the impact of breaks (start and stop) and/or mis-detected strides in short walking bouts may be much larger than in longer walking bouts when quantifying algorithms\u2019 performances.\nIndividual relative errors for stride length were higher for short walking bouts (e.g., < 10\u00a0s), although the median error did not seem to be significantly affected by bout length. digital mobility outcomes estimated from short walking bouts, which have been reported as the majority (about 50%) in real-world conditions [21, 67], should have special consideration as, in agreement with previous work, these walking bouts were observed to be the slowest [67], and therefore more sensitive to higher error estimation."

            "text": "When considering the optimal location of the sensor, the signals recorded at the lower back are less robust than at other locations, such as the foot or shank, for the identification of initial contact events [61], although still more accurate than wrist data [68]. However, the lower back is among the most clinically favourable location for a single device, given its cost (one device), its location near to the centre of mass (which represents the overall human motion pattern), ergonomic conditions when worn attached to a belt or affixed to the skin, and its clinical value for fall risk, trunk stability and balance control, among others [21, 60, 69].\nAn advantage of real-world gait monitoring is the possibility of capturing a large number of diverse walking bouts and truly unsupervised gait performance in an ecologically valid environment [20]. However, the presence of contextual factors in a real-world context, which were not accounted for in this study, may have significantly influenced the performance of the algorithms. In particular, the presence of turns, the deviation from a straight path or other gait tasks (e.g., slope, presence of stairs or/and obstacles, crowdedness of space, visibility of trajectory), and the usage of various walking aids may have altered the gait pattern of the participant [20] and may partially explain the larger errors observed for stride length.\nWhen comparing the performance between spatial and temporal digital mobility outcomes, the results indicate that the temporal characteristics (initial contact events, step duration, cadence) of gait,\u00a0 analysed with the proposed algorithms were more robust and valid than the spatial ones. This may be due to the fact that lower-back signals are better tailored to estimate particular events in the signal (i.e., initial contact events) and to assess its\nperiodicity (i.e., cadence estimation) than to estimate displacements. These aspects should be considered when using the proposed algorithms, especially when interpreting findings for clinical applications and assessing minimal detectable changes in pathological gait. Moreover, it should be noted that given the biomechanical relationship between temporal and spatial features of gait, the identification of temporal estimates may directly impact on spatial calculations [48]."

            "heading": "Limitations",
            "text": "The results presented here are derived from real-world data comparing outcomes from a single wearable device to a reference system, INDIP, that has been thoroughly characterized and validated in a laboratory context, against a stereophotogrammetric system [23]. We did not include validation of DMOs derived from the single wearable device against a laboratory-based reference system as the focus of this study was on real-world gait. It must be noted that a complete algorithm ranking methodology should not only consider the overall findings for each cohort (as in this study) but should also consider the performance of algorithms on stratified subgroups (e.g., based on gait speed: slow-medium-fast walkers). This can be done by assigning a higher weight to the slow walkers\u2019 results, given that their corresponding signals are more challenging and yield higher errors, as observed in this study. In addition, the percentage of walking bouts, as well as participants, in which the algorithm successfully provided digital mobility outcomes estimates should be considered to scale the overall performance of algorithms [24]. Thus, a simplified, although comprehensive, implementation of the ranking methodology could be seen as a limitation of this study. Nonetheless, the purpose of this was to provide an overall recommendation on the algorithm that performed best for each digital mobility outcome assessed in challenging real-world environments [20]. We are aware that, using a 2.5-h window of activity in the real world for the validation purposes, we may not have captured change and higher variability in mobility that are due to fatigue or the cyclic nature of activity. We also suggest that the inclusion of laboratory assessments for the implementation of the ranking methodology could be relevant. Indeed, even if collected under controlled or semi-structured conditions, data from short and slow walking bouts, that are typical in lab-based settings, may add variability and challenge algorithm performance [19]. In addition, the effect of walking aid use on results has not been assessed in this study. Thus, future work assessing this aspect could be clinically relevant, given the potential impact that walking aids (and the variety of types of walking aids) have on the quality of the wearable device signals and reference data [17], and\nas a consequence, on the assessment of the algorithm\u2019s performance."

            "text": "This work was aimed at providing recommendations to implement and select algorithms for real-world gait analysis using lower-back worn sensors in patient cohorts with mobility impairments. We achieved this by comprehensively assessing and ranking algorithms\u2019 performances, and we evaluated the effect of walking speed and walking bout duration on those performances.\nThe results highlighted good to excellent performances of the top algorithms in all cohorts. Particularly, algorithms for cadence and initial contact event detection were the most robust for all cohorts. Performances on gait sequence detection showed good performance measures, particularly when assessing sensitivity (> 0.70), positive predictive value (> 0.80), accuracy (> 0.95) and specificity (> 0.97). However, stride length estimation was the most challenging digital mobility outcome to estimate (with absolute error < 0.21\u00a0m). Relative errors for step duration and cadence generally decreased for longer walking bouts. Lower gait speeds (below 0.5\u00a0 m/s) negatively influenced step duration, cadence and stride length estimates. We identified two top-performer algorithms for gait sequence detection [16] and cadence [45, 46], and a single best performer for initial contact detection [16] and stride length [47, 48]. The proximal femoral fracture cohort was the most challenging for algorithm performance.\nIn conclusion, the identified algorithms allow a robust estimation of digital mobility outcomes and gait characterization, with potential for improvement identified for stride length. Throughout this study we made recommendations for algorithm selection and implementation. Thus, our findings can be used to support future choices of the most suitable algorithms for realworld gait analysis, depending on type of cohort and research question. Finally, these results may inform future design of novel and more efficient gait analysis algorithms.\nAbbreviations CAD Cadence estimation CI Confidence intervals CHF Congestive heart failure COPD Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease d Duration FP False positive FN False negative GSD Gait sequence detection HA Healthy adults ICC(2,1) Intra\u2011class correlation coefficient\nICD Initial contact detection INDIP INertial modules, DIstance Sensors and Pressure insoles LoA Limits of agreement MS Multiple sclerosis PD Parkinson\u2019s disease PFF Proximal femoral fracture SL Stride length estimation TN True negative TP True positive WB Walking bout WBD Walking bout duration WD Wearable device ws Walking speed FIR Finite impulse response filter\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s12984\u2011 023\u2011 01198\u20115.\nAdditional file\u00a01.
