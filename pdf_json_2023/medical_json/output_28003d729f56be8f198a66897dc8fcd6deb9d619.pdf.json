The performance of the NCDRS was assessed by the area under the curve (AUC).\nResults: The T2DM risk was significantly increased in participants with NCDRS \u226525 (HR = 2.12, 95% CI 1.88\u20132.39) compared with NCDRS <25 after adjusting for potential confounders. T2DM risk also showed a significant increasing trend from the lowest to the highest quartile of NCDRS. The AUC was 0.777 (95% CI 0.640\u20130.786) with a cutoff of 25.50.\nConclusion: The NCDRS had a significant positive association with T2DM risk, and the NCDRS is valid for T2DM screening in China.\nKeywords: screening, cohort study, China, T2DM, new Chinese diabetes risk score\nEdited by: Gabriel Gulis,\nUniversity of Southern Denmark, Denmark\nReviewed by: Betine Pinto Moehlecke Iser, Universidade do Sul de Santa Catarina, Brazil\n*Correspondence: Yanmei Lou\nhitila@sina.com Fulan Hu hufu1525@163.com Liping Li\nlpli@stu.edu.cn Changyi Wang\nwangchangyi2002@163.com\nThis Original Article is part of the IJPH Special Issue \u201cPublic Health and\nPrimary Care, is 1 + 1 = 1?\u201d\n\u2020These authors have contributed equally to this work\nReceived: 21 November 2022 Accepted: 27 March 2023 Published: 25 April 2023\nCitation: Chen H, She Y, Dai S, Wang L, Tao N, Huang S, Xu S, Lou Y, Hu F, Li L and Wang C (2023) Predicting the Risk of Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus with the New\nChinese Diabetes Risk Score in a Cohort Study.\nInt J Public Health 68:1605611. doi: 10.3389/ijph.2023.1605611\nAbbreviations: ALT, alanine aminotransferase; AST, aspartate aminotransferase; BMI, body mass index; CIs, Confidential Intervals; Cr, creatinine; DBP, diastolic blood pressure; eGFR, estimated glomerular filtration rate; EOS, eosinophil; EOSP, eosinophil percentage; ESR, erythrocyte sedimentation rate; FLD, fatty liver disease; FPG, fasting plasma glucose; GWASs, genome-wide association studies; HC, hip circumference; HDL-C, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol; HRs, Hazard Ratios; IQR, interquartile range; LDL-C, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol; MCV, mean corpuscular volume; NCDRS, The New Chinese Diabetes Risk Score; RCS, The restricted cubic splines; SBP, systolic blood pressure; SD, standard deviation; T2DM, Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus; TC, total cholesterol; TG, triglycerides; UA, serum uric acid; WBC, white blood cell count; WC,Waist circumference.\nInt J Public Health | Owned by SSPH+ | Published by Frontiers April 2023 | Volume 68 | Article 16056111\nInternational Journal of Public Health ORIGINAL ARTICLE\npublished: 25 April 2023 doi: 10.3389/ijph.2023.1605611"

            "text": "Diabetes is one of the most challenging public health problems worldwide (1). The International Diabetes Federation (IDF) reported that approximately 1 in 11 adults aged 20\u201379 years were living with diabetes globally, and 1 in 2 adults with diabetes were undiagnosed (2). The prevalence of diabetes in Chinese adults has increased to 11.2%, and the awareness rate, treatment rate, and control rate of diabetes are quite low, making diabetes one of the most serious chronic diseases in this country (3). Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), as the main type of diabetes patients, is preventable through multiple intervention programs (4\u20137). Therefore, an early approach to detect T2DM by simple screening tools, to provide timely interventions to individuals at high risk of developing T2DM, could reduce the risk of complications and be more cost-effective than current T2DM management approaches (4, 8).\nA series of well-designed risk score models have been developed in recent years for screening the population for undiagnosed T2DM. Generally, these models are composed of a few variables that can easily be obtained through medical health checks, and can predict the T2DM risk by adding up the scores of each variable (9). The Finnish Diabetes Risk score (FINDRISC) (10, 11), Cambridge Risk Score (CRS) (12), QDiabetes (13), and the Australian Type 2 Diabetes Risk Assessment Tool (AUSDRISK) are popular models used for T2DM risk prediction (14). However, previous studies were either limited by an inadequate sample size (10, 14), ethnicity derived from the Caucasian population (10\u201313), or validation only in a cross-sectional study (10, 11, 14). Further, previous Chinese risk score models for screening T2DM either failed to report important indicators (e.g., sex, family history of diabetes), consisted of clinical measurements, or even had low predictive values (15\u201317). A new simple and accurate T2DM risk prediction tool for the Chinese population is urgently needed to identify individuals with T2DM or at risk of T2DM, given the great burden that T2DM causes, enabling implementation of large scale T2DM screening in China (18).\nTheNewChinese Diabetes Risk Score (NCDRS) is a non-invasive T2DM assessment tool that includes 6 risk predictors: age, BMI, sex, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and family history of diabetes (19). The NCDRS was reported to be a reliable tool for detecting undiagnosed T2DM in a previous cross-sectional study conducted in Eastern China (20). However, to our knowledge, all of the studies that evaluated the NCDRS were cross-sectional (20\u201323), and cohort studies investigating the performance of NCDRS are missing. Whether the NCDRS performs well in recognizing undiagnosed T2DM needs to be validated in a large cohort study. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the association between the NCDRS and the risk of T2DM to determine its performance in predicting T2DM risk based on a large prospective cohort study."

Among them, we further excluded participants if any of the following criteria were met: 1) a history of myocardial infarction, stroke, coronary heart disease, heart failure (n = 1,377), or cancer (n = 507); and 2) aged <20 and \u226580 years (n = 804). Ultimately, we included 39,538 adults in this study with a median follow-up of 37.47 months. Variables with >5% missing data were imputed using the method of multiple imputation (24).\nThe study was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki (revised in 2013) (25) and it was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Xiaotangshan Hospital (No. 202006).

Smokers were defined as those who had smoked \u2265100 cigarettes in life, alcohol consumption was defined as drinking \u226512 times in the past year (26), and family history of diabetes was defined as having at least one first-degree relative with diabetes. Each participant answered the questionnaire by themselves or with assistance in a face to face interview if they had difficulty completing the survey.\nHeight and weight were measured with a standard method while wearing light clothing and no shoes. Waist and hip circumference (WC and HC) were measured using a nonstretchable tape meter by trained nurses. WC and HC were measured as the narrowest level between the lower rib and the iliac crest and at the level of the greatest protrusion of the buttocks, respectively, with participants standing erect with their feet together. The measurement of blood pressure was performed three times repeatedly at the heart level on the right arm using an electronic sphygmomanometer (HEM770AFuzzy, Omron, Japan) after being seated for at least 5 minutes of rest with 1-minute intervals between measurements. The final systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) were defined as the mean of the 3 measurements. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated as the ratio of weight to height squared (kg/m2).\nBlood samples were collected at 7\u201310 AM after an overnight fasting (at least 8 h) for the laboratory biochemical tests. The clinical indicators were analyzed including: serum uric acid (UA), creatinine (Cr), total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), fasting plasma glucose (FPG), white blood cell count (WBC), eosinophil count (EOS), eosinophil percentage (EOSP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR),\nInt J Public Health | Owned by SSPH+ | Published by Frontiers April 2023 | Volume 68 | Article 16056112\nmean corpuscular volume (MCV), and estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR).

As shown in Table 2, the incidence rates of T2DM according to the NCDRS quartiles were 0.146, 0.457, 1.394, and 3.268 per 100 person-years, respectively. The risk of T2DM was significantly increased with increasing NCDRS quartiles in all 3 models (P for trend <0.001). In Model 3, the highest HRs of T2DM risk were 1.76 (95% CI 1.25\u20132.47), 3.08 (95% CI 2.25\u20134.23), and 4.56 (95% CI 3.33\u20136.24) in the NCDRS of Q2, Q3, and Q4 (VS. Q1), respectively.

            "text": "From the 7-year long large prospective longitudinal cohort study to investigate the association between the NCDRS and the risk of\nT2DM, we found that there was a significant association between the increased NCDRS and the increasing risk of T2DM, and a significant S-shaped nonlinear dose-response relationship was observed between the NCDRS and T2DM risk. Additionally, the AUC of 0.777 with the best cut off point of 25.50 supported the best performance of NCDRS in predicting the risk of T2DM among Chinese population. Based on a large nationwide diabetes cross-sectional study conducted in 12 provinces and autonomous regions as well as 2 municipalities in China, the NCDRS was developed under the estimated coefficient of candidate diabetic risk factors in a regression analysis of 41,809 participants (19). By computing 6 independent non-laboratory indicators (age, BMI, sex, waist circumference, SBP, and family history of diabetes), the total score of each participant was used to assess the risk of T2DM (19). The NCDRS ranging from 0\u201351 with an optimal cutoff point of 25 was reported to be a reliable screening tool for detecting T2DM in the Chinese population (19, 21, 23). Our findings of a positive significant association between the NCDRS and T2DM risk are consistent with previous studies (20, 21, 23).\nWhen assessing the association between the NCDRS and the risk of T2DM, pre-diabetes is a non-negligible confounder that might impact the effect size. Previous studies showed that among adults diagnosed with prediabetes, approximately 70% progressed to T2DM within a decade (27). After excluding individuals who were diagnosed with T2DM in the first 2 years of follow-up from the sensitivity analysis, the association between the NCDRS and the risk of T2DM was slightly lower than the association in the original multivariable Cox proportional hazards models, which confirmed that prediabetes indeed exaggerated the relationship between the NCDRS and the risk of T2DM. Furthermore, a nonlinear association between the NCDRS and the risk of T2DM was found through a restricted cubic spline model, and in line\nFIGURE 2 | The area under the curve of the New Chinese Diabetes Risk Score compared with body mass index, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and family history of diabetes (Beijing, China. 2009\u20132016).\nInt J Public Health | Owned by SSPH+ | Published by Frontiers April 2023 | Volume 68 | Article 16056115\nwith our Cox regression results, the risk of T2DM increased with an increasing NCDRS score. While the recommended cutoff point of the NCDRS was 25 (19), in our study, we found that the risk of T2DM sharply increased with NCDRS scores greater\nthan 21.96. Considering this, future studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods need to be conducted to verify whether adults with an NCDRS score greater than 21.96 deserve attention in community T2DM prevention programs.\nTABLE 3 | Subgroup analysis for the association between the New Chinese Diabetes Risk Score level and risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus (Beijing, China. 2009\u20132016).\nNCDRS Person-year No. of T2DM Incidence (per 100 person-years) HR (95% CI)\nModel 1a Model 2b Model 3c\nMale Q1 7,531.031 11 0.146 1(References) 1(References) 1(References) Q2 16,520.778 84 0.508 2.66 (1.74, 4.07) 1.75 (1.14, 2.67) 1.80 (1.17, 2.78) Q3 27,039.147 374 1.383 9.24 (6.37, 13.40) 3.93 (2.69, 5.74) 4.03 (2.71, 5.98) Q4 31,706.269 1,050 3.312 20.05 (13.95, 28.82) 5.44 (3.73, 7.95) 5.65 (3.76, 8.47) P for trend <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <25 35,099.083 211 0.601 1(References) 1(References) 1(References) \u226525 47,698.142 1,308 2.742 6.67 (5.54, 8.03) 2.74 (2.25, 3.34) 2.66 (2.15, 3.28) Per SD increase 3.00 (2.72, 3.30) 1.79 (1.61, 1.99) 1.80 (1.60, 2.03) Female Q1 22,631.900 33 0.146 1(References) 1(References) 1(References) Q2 15,184.583 61 0.402 3.42 (1.83, 6.42) 2.22 (1.18, 4.17) 2.04 (1.09, 3.84) Q3 12,489.364 177 1.417 9.18 (5.04, 16.73) 3.71 (2.03, 6.77) 3.32 (1.81, 6.08) Q4 8,378.361 260 3.103 21.84 (12.06, 39.57) 5.63 (3.09, 10.23) 5.23 (2.87, 9.55) P for trend <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <25 44,017.269 160 0.363 1(References) 1(References) 1(References) \u226525 14,666.939 371 2.529 4.47 (3.86, 5.17) 2.01 (1.73, 2.34) 2.02 (1.73, 2.35) Per SD increase 2.59 (2.41, 2.77) 1.59 (1.47, 1.71) 1.63 (1.51, 1.77) Hypertension (no) Q1 30,056.931 44 0.146 1(References) 1(References) 1(References) Q2 30,477.169 132 0.433 2.88 (2.04, 4.05) 1.72 (1.22, 2.43) 1.53 (1.08, 2.17) Q3 32,080.808 409 1.275 8.34 (6.11, 11.38) 2.96 (2.15, 4.06) 2.46 (1.78, 3.41) Q4 18,132.903 515 2.840 18.37 (13.49, 24.99) 4.21 (3.06, 5.8) 3.54 (2.55, 4.92) P for trend <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <25 75,615.661 329 0.435 1(References) 1(References) 1(References) \u226525 35,132.150 771 2.195 4.87 (4.28, 5.55) 1.96 (1.71, 2.25) 1.82 (1.58, 2.09) Per SD increase 3.04 (2.81, 3.28) 1.68 (1.55, 1.83) 1.62 (1.48, 1.78) Hypertension (yes) Q1&Q2 1,334.192 13 0.974 1(References) 1(References) 1(References) Q3 7,447.703 142 1.907 1.91 (1.08, 3.38) 1.56 (0.88, 2.75) 1.47 (0.83, 2.60) Q4 21,951.728 795 3.622 3.62 (2.09, 6.27) 2.15 (1.24, 3.72) 2.07 (1.19, 3.59) P for trend <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <25 3,500.692 42 1.200 1(References) 1(References) 1(References) \u226525 27,232.931 908 3.334 2.73 (2.00, 3.72) 1.83 (1.34, 2.5) 1.85 (1.36, 2.53) Per SD increase 1.87 (1.68, 2.09) 1.37 (1.22, 1.53) 1.39 (1.24, 1.56) Fatty liver disease (no) Q1 28,904.097 35 0.121 1(References) 1(References) 1(References) Q2 25,368.922 81 0.319 2.57 (1.73, 3.81) 1.72 (1.15, 2.56) 1.68 (1.13, 2.51) Q3 23,114.647 220 0.952 7.53 (5.27, 10.75) 3.27 (2.27, 4.7) 3.17 (2.18, 4.60) Q4 16,570.086 365 2.203 17.26 (12.19, 24.43) 4.72 (3.29, 6.78) 4.49 (3.09, 6.52) P for trend <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <25 65,121.833 186 0.286 1(References) 1(References) 1(References) \u226525 28,835.919 515 1.786 6.03 (5.10, 7.14) 2.53 (2.11, 3.02) 2.42 (2.01, 2.92) Per SD increase 2.83 (2.59, 3.08) 1.70 (1.55, 1.87) 1.67 (1.51, 1.84) Fatty liver disease (yes) Q1 1,258.833 9 0.715 1(References) 1(References) 1(References) Q2 6,336.439 64 1.010 1.40 (0.69, 2.80) 1.07 (0.53, 2.16) 1.09 (0.54, 2.19) Q3 16,413.864 331 2.017 2.74 (1.41, 5.32) 1.53 (0.79, 2.98) 1.52 (0.78, 2.95) Q4 23,514.544 945 4.019 5.45 (2.82, 10.50) 2.13 (1.10, 4.12) 2.24 (1.16, 4.34) P for trend <0.001 <0.001 <0.001 <25 13,994.519 185 1.322 1(References) 1(References) 1(References) \u226525 33,529.161 1,164 3.472 2.58 (2.21, 3.02) 1.54 (1.32, 1.80) 1.61 (1.38, 1.89) Per SD increase 2.04 (1.89, 2.21) 1.38 (1.27, 1.50) 1.45 (1.33, 1.58)\naModel 1: Unadjusted. bModel 2: Adjusted for Glu, smoking status, and alcohol consumption. cModel 3: Further adjusted for TG, TC, HDL, ALT, AST, eGFR, UA, heart rate, and white blood cell count (WBC) and all covariates in Model 2.\nInt J Public Health | Owned by SSPH+ | Published by Frontiers April 2023 | Volume 68 | Article 16056116\nIn the present prospective cohort study, the AUC of the NCDRS to predict the risk of T2DM was 0.777, which indicated it performed better than in the original population (19).

However, the crosssectional studies conducted in Eastern and Southwest Chinese populations reported that the best cutoff points of the NCDRS for detecting T2DM were 27 and 28, respectively, which are much higher than those in our study (20, 23). These variations among different studies could be explained as follows: first, the optimal cutoff point might be a result of the different average ages for each population among these studies, and individuals with older ages have a higher cutoff point for T2DM detection (28). Second, differences among regions could be a critical factor in identifying T2DM, suggesting that studies of the NCDRS in different regions of China are required (28). In addition, the AUCs of the various components of the NCDRS are smaller than the AUC of the NCDRS for detecting T2DM. Thus, the NCDRS as a comprehensive risk score model is more effective for T2DM prediction than single indicators such as BMI, waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, and family history of diabetes.\nThe mechanisms of how obesity is associated with T2DM risk have been recognized. Obesity induces low-level inflammation in various tissues (e.g., adipose tissue, liver, pancreas islet, and brain), and obesity-related immune cells accumulate and engage in inflammatory polarization, contributing to obesitylinked metabolic dysfunctions, resulting in insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes mellitus (29, 30). Therefore, obesity is the most important predictor of T2DM in NCDRS. Given that BMI and waist circumference (WC) are basic anthropometric indicators of obesity and abdominal obesity (31), participants with higher BMI or WC had an increased predisposition to T2DM (32). Likewise, some unhealthy lifestyle behaviors, such as more frequent smoking or high alcohol consumption are more common in\nChinese men, which possibly exerts sex-dimorphic effects on glucose metabolism leading to gender differences in the risk of T2DM (33, 34). Unsurprisingly, aging is another typical factor contributing to T2DM, especially after age 40 (35), and a proinflammatory state as an inevitable age-related condition inducing insulin resistance, might shed light on the higher risk of T2DM as age increases (32, 36). Furthermore, hypertension and T2DM are common comorbidities (37). Several longitudinal studies found that participants with hypertension or prehypertension were at high risk of developing diabetes mellitus (38), since hypertension patients always exhibit insulin resistance, which increases the risk of T2DM(37), and SBP control is associated with a lower risk of diabetes mellitus (39). On the other hand, the association between SBP and T2DM complications of renal dysfunction (40) and vision problems means SBP is a significant factor in T2DM prediction. Similarly, commonly identified genetic variants in successive genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have helped to explain the increased susceptibility of participants with a family member with T2DM (41). Thus, the NCDRS\u2014a comprehensive tool reflecting T2DM risk\u2014might be useful for T2DM screening in the Chinese population.\nIn our study, we also conducted stratified analyses by sex, hypertension, and fatty liver disease at baseline. Fatty liver disease is a confounder of the association between the NCDRS and the risk of T2DM. A five-year cohort study conducted in Northern China reported that fatty liver disease was an indicator in T2DM prediction (42). Likewise, the causal relationship between fatty liver disease and T2DM was also concluded in a meta-analysis (43). However, we found a stronger association between the NCDRS and T2DM in non-fatty liver disease participants than in the fatty liver disease population, which was contradictory to the previous study. An explanation for this could be that aiming to decrease liver fat contributes to preventing T2DM, and patients who had fatty liver disease might takemore lipid-regulatory drugs to decrease liver fat, potentially leading to the decrease of T2DM risk (44). Further research with larger samples of the subgroup analyses are needed to validate the association between the NCDRS and the risk of T2DM in participants with or without fatty liver disease.\nInt J Public Health | Owned by SSPH+ | Published by Frontiers April 2023 | Volume 68 | Article 16056117\nSeveral limitations to the current study should be considered. First, the data for our study were obtained from a local rehabilitation hospital in Beijing, whose patients are mostly employees of local governmental organizations, lacking representation of the general population. Therefore, further evidence from different types of T2DM patients is needed to confirm our findings, and additional studies are needed to confirm whether the NCDRS is useful for T2DM screening for other populations of different ethnicities. Second, reporting bias could not be overlooked when conducting face to face interviews for participants who had difficulty completing the survey. Moreover, other unmeasured related confounders, such as the frequency of physical activity, and dietary intake habits, should be taken into consideration to estimate the association between the NCDRS and the risk of T2DM.\nDespite the limitations mentioned above, this study also provides some practical strengths for the NCDRS in predicting T2DM risk. First, we add new evidence that the association between the NCDRS and T2DM risk is nonlinear and shaped like an S. Second, as the NCDRS includes only easily measured factors which do not require laboratory work, and has great performance, it might be suitable for the population of T2DM screening under limited health resource conditions in most of China. Additionally, considering that our study was based on annual check-up data mostly from employees of local governmental organizations, the NCDRS could be a simple, practical model in T2DM screening for this certain occupational population to identify their risk of T2DM by using electronic health records by general practitioners, with a reference of the optimized cutoff derived from this study, to help with further T2DM intervention programs."
