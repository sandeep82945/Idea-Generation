    "abstractText": "The nature and strength of interactions for an anti-HIV drug, Lamivudine, were studied in a pure crystal form of the drug and the ligand\u2013receptor complexes. High-resolution singlecrystal X-ray diffraction studies of the tetragonal polymorph allowed the drug\u2019s experimental charge density distribution in the solid state to be obtained. The QM/MM calculations were performed for a simplified model of the Lamivudine complex with deoxycytidine kinase (two complexes with different binding modes) to reconstruct the theoretical charge density distribution. The peculiarities of intramolecular interactions were compared with previously reported data for an isolated molecule. Intermolecular interactions were revealed within the quantum theory of \u2018Atoms in Molecules\u2019, and their contributions to the total crystal energy or ligand\u2013receptor binding energy were evaluated. It was demonstrated that the crystal field effect weakened the intramolecular interactions. Overall, the energies of intermolecular interactions in ligand\u2013receptor complexes (320.1\u2013394.8 kJ/mol) were higher than the energies of interactions in the crystal (276.9 kJ/mol) due to the larger number of hydrophilic interactions. In contrast, the sum of the energies of hydrophobic interactions was found to be unchanged. It was demonstrated by means of the Voronoi tessellation that molecular volume remained constant for different molecular conformations (250(13) \u00c53) and increased up to 399 \u00c53 and 521(30) \u00c53 for the Lamivudine phosphate and triphosphate.",

            "text": "Nucleoside inhibitors of reverse transcriptase (NIRTs) are a great family of drugs for antiretroviral therapy for HIV. Among them, Lamivudine (the commonly adopted name is 3TC) is an old and widely used medication agent for the treatment of both HIV-1 [1] and HIV-2 [2]. Besides HIV, the activity of 3TC against hepatitis B [2] has been demonstrated. From a structural point of view, Lamivudine, as with most NIRTs, consists of the heterocyclic planar dihydroxypirimidine-2-one fragment and a modified cytidine (3-thiacytidine) moiety (Figure 1a). Both of its main structural parts contain additional donor and acceptor groups that can act as a donor and/or an acceptor of rather strong intermolecular interactions to form hydrogen bonds. In addition, two main structural fragments of 3TC are connected by an ordinary N-C bond, which allows for almost free rotation around this bond, so molecular conformation and shape can vary in order to realize various intermolecular interactions in the solid form or in a complex with the receptor. As a result, the above-mentioned features of 3TC have been utilized in many published articles [3\u201326] describing the preparation and crystal structures of different salts, polymorphs, and cocrystals with various co-formers.

Early computational studies focused on the conformational analysis of 3TC and revealed its electronic structures [29]. It was demonstrated that the molecular conformation of an isolated 3TC molecule is characterized by the presence of four minima stabilized by weak intramolecular C-H\u2026O (conformations A and B), and both strong OH\u2026O and weak C-H\u2026O (conformations C and D) interactions (Scheme 1). The difference between the most stable and the less stable conformers is only 13.7 kJ/mol [29]. This value is comparable with the energy of one strong O-H\u2026O hydrogen bond. Despite a detailed computational study of an isolated molecule of 3TC, information about the nature and the energy of intermolecular interactions formed by Lamivudine in the crystal or in ligand\u2013receptor complexes is still incomplete. The most useful experimental method to remove such an incompleteness is an experimental high-resolution X-ray study, with subsequent topological analysis of the resulting charge density distribution in terms of the R.

[30]; however, it seems to be still unpublished in scientific journals). Unfortunately, experimental charge density studies of the ligand\u2013receptor complexes of 3TC are impossible, so quantum chemical studies of simplified systems are necessary to characterize adequately the charge density distribution in the region of the binding site including 3TC and surrounding amino acidic residues. Herein, we discuss an experimental charge density study of the tetragonal polymorph II of 3TC, especially the nature and energy of intermolecular interactions in its crystal packing. To compare the strength of intermolecular interactions with those in ligand\u2013receptor complexes, quantum chemical calculations of simplified models based on the 2NOA structure [31] taken from PDB were carried out (Figure 2). The usage of Voronoi tessellation to the crystal structures of polymorphs, salts, solvatomorphs and ligand\u2013receptor complexes of 3TC and 3TC-TP and the comparison with charge density and quantum chemical studies allowed us to verify how the results obtained for small molecules are applicable for biomolecules.

Convergency factors for this refinement are listed in Table 1.

Multipole Refinement\nThe charge distribution in 3TC was obtained using multipole formalism [39], as implemented in the XD2006 package [40], with core and valence electron density derived from wave functions fitted to a relativistic Dirac\u2013Fock solution. In the first step, the scale factor was refined from all data. After that, high-order refinement (sin(\u03b8)/\u03bb > 0.7\u00c5) of atomic positions and atomic displacement parameters incorporating all non-hydrogen atoms was employed, followed by refinement of hydrogen atoms positions, with C\u2013H, N\u2013H, and O\u2013H distances fixed at values obtained from neutron diffraction [41]. The ADPs for hydrogen atoms were estimated using SHADE3 [42]. All non-hydrogen atoms were described at the octupolar level. For the H atoms, only the monopole population and the dipole populations were refined, while \u03ba and \u03ba\u2019 were fixed at 1.2. Separate \u03ba parameters were used for all non-hydrogen atoms; the \u03ban\u2019 (n = 1\u20134) parameters were also refined. During the final stage of the refinement, the multipole parameters, positions, and thermal parameters of all non-hydrogen atoms and monopoles were refined. All bonded pairs of atoms satisfied the Hirshfeld criterion. The experimental and refinement parameters are listed in Table 1. The molecular view is depicted in Figure 1b.

            "text": "To reveal the strength of interactions between 3TC and protein molecules, two simplified models were calculated. To construct these models, the structure of the deoxycytidine kinase complex with 3TC and ADP were used as a starting point. This structure contained two cavities with chemically unmodified 3TC molecules inside that could be considered as binding sites. The coordinates of 3TC molecules, surrounding peptide chains, and water molecules were extracted from the corresponding pdb file, and the positions of hydrogen atoms were recalculated. The number of amino acid residues and water molecules were sufficient to describe all interactions between 3TC and receptor molecules in selected binding sites. The next step was related to structure optimization. QM regions were chosen to consider all possible direct interactions between 3TC, amino acid residues, and water molecules. In the two models of receptor\u20133TC complexes (denoted as complex A and complex B), the sizes of QM regions used for optimization were 109 and 116 atoms, respectively (schematical representation is shown in Figure 2). MM regions of these models contained 2211 and 959 atoms, respectively. The following combination was applied to optimize the geometry of models: PBE/6-31G(d,p) for QM part and Amber force field for the rest of the amino acidic residues (ff19SB parameter set for MM part). Water molecules in the MM part and 3TC molecule were described using TIP3P and gaff2 parameters. All optimized configurations have been proven to be in the minima of energy by frequencies calculations. To calculate charge density functions, several amino acid residues that did not form any significant interactions with 3TC molecules but were disposed nearby were additionally included in the QM part. As a result, the charge density functions were calculated for clusters of 379 and 356 atoms (for complexes A and B, respectively). The geometry optimization, hessian and charge density calculations of complexes A and B were carried out using Gaussian09 software [46]. Charge density functions for complexes A and B were analyzed in terms of AIM theory [47], and the NCI method [48] using Multiwfn software [49].

Particularly, in the pure 3TC, a bcp is found for the C3-H3 . . . O3 interaction between dihydroxypirimidine-2-one and oxatiolan-5-yl moiety, confirming that this molecule realizes the conformation A. The second intramolecular interaction is related to the bonding between the hydroxyl group and the dihydroxypirimidine-2-one fragment (C7-H7 . . . O2). In the optimized 2NOA complexes with another conformation of the five-membered cycle, the conformation of 3TC\nBiomedicines 2023, 11, 743 7 of 17\nis stabilized by intermolecular bifurcated bonding of the C-H group to the oxygen atom of the five-membered ring and a hydrogen atom of the CH2 fragment (complexes A and B), and an O-H . . . O bond and C-H . . . O=C interaction to, respectively, an oxygen atom and a CH2 group of the heterocycle (complex B). Intramolecular bonds correspond to closed-shell interactions, so their energies can be evaluated with the correlation formula proposed by Espinosa et al. (EML, [52]). The energies of C-H . . . O bonds estimated using this formula in pure 3TC and its ligand\u2013 receptor complexes vary from \u221214.4 to \u221217.3 and from \u221216.8 to \u221217.1 kJ/mol. Using the results of the AIM study of the conformer A and EML formula, it is possible to evaluate the strength of similar C-H . . . O bonds in the conformer A. In an isolated conformer A, the strength of these C-H . . . O bonds becomes considerably larger (\u221221 and \u221225 kJ/mol). Such an overestimation of C-H . . . O bond strength is related to the effect of crystal packing. In ligand\u2013receptor complexes, H . . . H interactions are also found to be as strong as \u22124.8\u2013\u22129.0 kJ/mol. Anyway, the AIM study of 3TC has demonstrated the important role of the intramolecular bonding in stabilizing a given conformation and the fact that different sets of weak intramolecular interactions can stabilize similar conformations. Considering that the 3TC molecule in both complex A and B realizes the conformation close to the experimental one in its tetragonal polymorph, their molecular shapes and molecular electrostatic potentials should also be similar. This makes a comparison of intermolecular interactions for each molecule of great interest."

            "text": "3.2.1. H-Bonding Patterns in a Different Environment\nBased on chemical composition, the Lamivudine molecule can form numerous hydrogen bonds. It contains two donor groups for H-bonding (the amine and hydroxyl) and five functional groups (oxygen atoms of the carbonyl O=C, hydroxyl OH, heterocycle, with heteroatoms N2het, O2het and S) and potentially is able to act as an acceptor of H-bonding. Thus, pure Lamivudine can theoretically realize ten types of hydrogen bonds, listed in Table 2. However, the propensities of occurrences for these bonds can be ranked with good discrimination (the area under the ROC curve is equal to 0.89) to reveal the most and the least likely to occur, as described in refs. [53,54]. Surprisingly, the only expected intramolecular H-bond within this approach is the O-H . . . O2het interaction observed in the complex B. The O-H . . . O=C interaction, which is expected to be present for two theoretically stable conformations proposed by Fidanza et al. [29], is unlikely to occur. For intermolecular interactions, the amino group is a better donor of H-bonds than the hydroxyl group; the carbonyl, hydroxyl, and N2het atoms are good acceptors, while O2het= and S are poor acceptors.

            "text": "ithin the Voronoi tessellation of crystal space, all points within an atomic domain are closer to the inner atom than to any external one. A molecular Voronoi polyhedron (MVP) consists of atomic Voronoi polyhedra constructing the molecule [56]. The faces of atomic Voronoi polyhedra form the olecular Voronoi surface, and a pair of atoms that shares a molecular surface is supposed to form an intermolecular interaction. The MVP represents well molecular volumes and networks f intermolecular interactions in crystals of small molecules [34,57\u201361], compared with the AIM appr ch. It has also been pplied to compare Imati ib i ter ctio s in sm ll molecules and ligand\u2013receptor complexes [32] and f r analysis of protein volumes and packing [62\u201364], a d for interactions between macromolecules [65,66]. However, a comparison of MVP and AIM for ligand\u2013receptor complexes has not been carried out to our knowledge. The number of facets on atomic Voronoi polyhedra exceeds the number of intermolecular interactions. Thus, the faces that correspond to indirect interactions (the line between a pair of\nBiomedicines 2023, 11, 743 12 of 17\natoms does not intersect their common face of a Voronoi polyhedron) or to direct interactions with small solid angles \u2126 are supposed to be non-binding or forced interactions. It has previously been demonstrated that \u2126 > 10, 10, and 5% allows the majority of strong and weak hydrogen bonds, agostic interactions, and halogen bonds to be revealed [34,57\u201361]. We carried out a similar analysis for the Lamivudine molecule in the crystal and two optimized ligand\u2013receptor complexes. The results are summarized in Table 3. Similar to previously reported results, one can conclude that the indirect interactions are non-bonding even when the corresponding \u2126 value is large (bcps were found only for 2 of 4525 indirect neighbors). Secondly, the \u2126 value that allows revealing bonding interactions depends on the type of the connected atoms. For both strong and weak hydrogen bonds, \u2126 > 5% reveals the majority of such interactions with a minimum of false positive and false negative interactions. Dihydrogen bonds \u2126 > 10% should be used to decrease the number of false positive H . . . H interactions. It is worth mentioning also that similar \u2126 values can be used for both single crystals in small molecules and ligand\u2013receptor complexes. In Table 3, both intra- and intermolecular interactions are summarized. However, it can be mentioned that in ligand\u2013receptor complexes the overall number of hydrogen bonds is higher than that in pure Lamivudine due to a different molecular environment. The number of H-bond donors in ligand\u2013receptor complexes is higher. Thus, the oxygen and sulfur atoms of the Lamivudine\u2019 heterocycle are also able to act as acceptors of H-bonding. That is why no S . . . S bonding is observed in ligand\u2013receptor complexes. The contribution of various types of intermolecular interactions to the Voronoi molecular surface can be compared with that of the sum energy of molecular bonding. These data are visualized in Figure 6b. First of all, it should be mentioned that, within the Voronoi tessellation, there are bonding, non-bonding, and forced contacts for the molecular surface. Thus, besides bonding interactions revealed within the AIM approach, some surface goes to N . . . O, O . . . O, and S . . . N interactions, although their contribution to the total molecular surface is very low (Table S3). Another important difference between the results of the Voronoi tessellation and the AIM theory is that the contribution of hydrophilic interactions to the molecular surface is nearly two times lower (c.a. 40% vs. 85%) than the contribution to the sum energy of molecular interactions. This fact results from an equal division of crystal space between two atoms with non-equivalent electronegativity in the Voronoi approach. In fact, a zero-flux surface is shifted to one of them. Besides, for complex B with elongated interatomic distances and probably voids with missing atoms and groups of atoms, the results of the Voronoi tessellation are not highly reliable\u2014this can explain both the enlarged molecular volume and surface, and the fact that two bcps in this complex correspond to non-direct interactions. Nevertheless, some regularities concerning the role of different types of interactions remain common for both models: (i) the contribution of the hydrophilic interactions to the molecular surface remains nearly constant (for complex A and crystal), (ii) the contribution of the H . . . O interactions to the molecular surface and sum energy is higher than that of H . . . N interactions, and in ligand\u2013receptor complexes the former are more frequently observed. Qualitative and semiquantitative correlation for these two models also allows the use of the Voronoi tessellation for analysis of intermolecular interactions in other solids and ligand\u2013receptor complexes. We considered 19 fully-ordered solids containing the 3TC neutral molecule or the H3TC+ cation (including the tetragonal polymorph) and four ligand\u2013receptor complexes with 3TC, 3TC-TP or 3TC-3TP (TP and 3TP denote the phosphate or triphosphate group), where no empty space is present near the ligand. The molecular volume and surface for this molecule remain constant for different conformations, environments (both in crystals and complexes), and compositions (for 3TC and H3TC+), and are equal to 250(13) \u00c53 and 270(11) \u00c52. These values increase in Lamivudine phosphate (399 \u00c53 and 398 \u00c52) and triphosphate (521(30) \u00c53 and 502(20) \u00c52). The contribution of hydrophilic interactions to the molecular Voronoi surface of Lamivudine forms varies from 36 to 61%. For complexes of 3TC-TP and 3TC-3TP, the area that goes to hydrophilic interactions increases (173 and 265(9) \u00c52 compared with 127(14) \u00c52), but the percentage\nBiomedicines 2023, 11, 743 13 of 17\nremains nearly unchanged (43% and 53(3)% compared with 47(5)%). Analysis of unusually high contributions of some interactions to the molecular surface allows revealing, for example, of chalcogen bonds or strong S . . . H interactions (Figure 10).\n1 False negative, positive and false positive denote, respectively, interactions for which (i) a bcp is found, but the \u2126 angle is below the reference value, (ii) the presence of a bcp for contact with the angle above the reference \u2126 value, and (iii) contact with the \u2126 angle above the reference value, but without a bcp. 2 Strong donors (O, N) and acceptors (O, N, S) of H-bonding are denoted as A and D, respectively.\ncompared with 47(5)%).

The likelihood of formation of strong hydrogen bonds decreases from amine- to hydroxide group as donors and from O=C to OH, Nhet, Ohet and to Shet atoms as acceptors of H-bonding. This fact is in accord with experimentally observed structures, where Ohet and Shet atoms take part in H-bonding only at ligand\u2013receptor complexes, and with the energies of hydrogen bonds, which fall from O\u2013 H\u2026N (\u221251.1 kJ/mol, crystal) to N\u2013H\u2026N (\u221241.6 kJ/mol, complex), N\u2013H\u2026O (vary from \u221214.3 to \u221235.9 kJ/mol, crystal; vary from \u221228.9 to \u221257.6 kJ/mol, complex), O-H\u2026O (vary from \u22127.9 to \u221226.2, complex), and O-H\u2026S (-15.7 kJ/mol, complex). Similar types of interactions in complexes are, in general, stronger than in pure solids. The increased number of H-bond donors in the molecular environment also results in an increased sum of molecular energy from the ligand\u2013receptor complexes (320.1\u2013394.8 kJ/mol) to the crystal (276.9 kJ/mol). This increase comes mainly from hydrophilic interactions, as both their sum energy and contribution to the overall energy of interactions increases. For comparison of Lamivudine\u2019s intermolecular interactions in a series of compounds, the Voronoi tessellation of crystal space was applied. It is demonstrated for the first time that, within this approach, bonding and non-bonding interactions can be revealed not only for solids but also for ligand\u2013receptor complexes. Particularly, no bcps are found for the nondirect contacts in terms of the Voronoi tessellation, while direct interactions with the solid angles \u2126 = 5, 5 and 10% allow for revealing 79, 91 and 77% of strong, weak hydrogen bonds and dihydrogen interactions with a minimum of false positive results. These \u2126 values coincide with previously reported ones for solids containing small molecules. Analysis of 23 solids comprising 44 independent Lamivudine molecules or their derivatives within the Voronoi approach demonstrates that molecular volume remains constant for different molecular conformations (250(13) \u00c53) and increases up to 399 \u00c53 and 521(30) \u00c53 for Lamivudine phosphate and triphosphate, respectively.
