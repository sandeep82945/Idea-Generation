 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading the paper on depth-aware neural style transfer:

1. Exploring different loss functions and network architectures for depth-aware style transfer. The paper uses a simple L1 loss for depth reconstruction. Other losses like perceptual loss or adversarial loss could be explored. The network architecture can also be modified.

2. Applying the depth-aware style transfer to video stylization. The paper focuses on images, but extending this to videos could create realistic artistic videos. Maintaining temporal consistency would be a challenge.  

3. Investigating how to handle incomplete or noisy depth data. The paper assumes accurate depth maps are available. Handling missing depth data and noise in real sensor data could improve applicability.

4. Combining depth-aware style transfer with novel view synthesis. The depth maps could be used to synthesize new views of a scene and stylize those views in a consistent manner. This can enable 3D artistic virtual walkthroughs.

5. Using depth-aware style transfer for domain adaptation. The stylized RGBD images could be used to bridge the gap between synthetic data (rendered 3D scenes) and real-world data for tasks like object detection. The depth could help align the domains.
