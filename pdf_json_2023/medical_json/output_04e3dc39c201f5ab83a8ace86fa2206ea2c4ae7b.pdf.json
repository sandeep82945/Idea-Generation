    "abstractText": "Chilli is an important commercial crop grown in tropical and subtropical climates. The whitefly-transmitted chilli leaf curl virus (ChiLCV) is a serious threat to chilli cultivation. Vector migration rate and host\u2013vector contact rate, the major drivers involved in the epidemic process, have been pinpointed to link management. The complete interception of migrant vectors immediately after transplantation has been noted to increase the survival time (to remain infection free) of the plants (80%) and thereby delay the epidemic process. The survival time under interception (30 days) has been noted to be nine weeks (p < 0.05), as compared to five weeks, which received a shorter period of interception (14\u201321 days). Non-significant differences in hazard ratios between 21and 30-day interceptions helped optimize the cover period to 26 days. Vector feeding rate, estimated as a component of contact rate, is noted to increase until the sixth week with host density and decline subsequently due to plant succulence factor. Correspondence between the peak time of virus transmission or inoculation rate (at 8 weeks) and contact rate (at 6 weeks) suggests that host succulence is of critical importance in host\u2013vector interactions. Infection proportion estimates in inoculated plants at different leaf stages have supported the view that virus transmission potential with plant age decreases, presumably due to modification in contact rate. The hypothesis that migrant vectors and contact rate dynamics are the primary drivers of the epidemic has been proved and translated into rules to guide management strategies.",

            "text": "Chilli is an important commercial crop grown in India, Indonesia, China, Japan, Indonesia, Spain, and Turkey. Leaf curl disease in chilli is one of the most economically significant diseases. It is known to be caused by several begomoviruses, of which chilli leaf curl virus (ChiLCV) is the most predominant in India [1]. The virus is efficiently spread by whitefly (Bemisia tabaci), which is abundant year-round in tropical and subtropical climates containing a wide variety of reservoir hosts [2]. In addition, semi-natural habitats, border vegetations (legumes and cucurbits on iron hurdles), and weeds also serve as a means for survival [3]. Recently, whitefly-transmitted viruses have become an increasingly influential group of harmful pathogens of vegetables throughout the tropical and subtropical world [4\u20136]. Begomoviruses (family Geminiviridae) are the most destructive plant viruses that cause diseases, such as leaf curl, mosaic, yellow mosaic, and yellow vein mosaic, in numerous crop plants [7]. In chilli, infected plants show upward leaf-curling, boat-shaped downward curling, distortion, vein yellowing, or more generalized leaf yellowing and/or stunted growth with a bushy appearance [8]. Therefore, symptoms associated with leaf curl appear to be complex and compounded by simultaneous attacks by thrips and mites, along with the viruses they carry\nViruses 2023, 15, 854. https://doi.org/10.3390/v15040854 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/viruses\nViruses 2023, 15, 854 2 of 17\nfrom various hosts such as legumes, solanaceous, and cucurbits [9,10]. In terms of yield loss, leaf curl has been the most damaging across all cropping regions [1]. In severe cases, up to 100% losses of marketable fruits have been reported [9,10]. Plant growth and development are severely impaired due to the interruption of major biosynthetic processes where both viral infection and direct vector feeding play significant roles in inducing leaf deformation and abnormal growth [5]. Furthermore, the early growth or succulent stage is highly vulnerable to sucking pests in chilli (whiteflies, thrips, aphids, and mites) and the viruses they transmit [11]. The management of leaf curl diseases remains a pressing issue. Barrier or mixed crops, repellent, and pesticide applications aimed at checking vectors remain ineffective due to a lack of clear perception of dynamic tripartite (i.e., ChiLCV\u2013whitefly\u2013chilli plant) interactions in the epidemic process. Furthermore, precise information on the etiological association with complex symptoms, epidemiological insights, and phenological affiliation with vulnerability is insufficient and yet to be resolved cohesively. An in-depth epidemiological understanding of the tripartite interactions to predict and manage their consequences is necessary to evolve a management strategy. Leaf curl epidemic in chilli is the result of tripartite interactions between host\u2013vector\u2013 virus, which is further complicated by simultaneous attacks of thrips and mites [11\u201313]. The progress of tripartite interactions over time is influenced by several factors associated with the host and vectors and modified by temperature [11]. Host susceptibility, age, cropping intensity, spatial distribution, and the potency of infected hosts are the crucial factors that modify the interaction process [14\u201316]. The contact rate between the viruliferous vector and the growing host is crucial in epidemic development [17,18]. Therefore, the number of viruliferous vectors, their mobility, spatial distribution, and host behaviour immensely affect the contact rate [11]. Changes in host growth and vector population over time will likely alter the contact rate, resulting in variation in the virus transmission rate. Therefore, periods of high contact appear to be critical points of intervention [17]. Precise intervention to lower contact rates that reduces the proportion of infectious hosts may provide clues for the development of management guides [19]. Assessing contact rate dynamics and its link with epidemic development requires a framework model incorporating tripartite interactions [20]. Population dynamical models to explain tripartite interactions for vector-borne virus diseases have been used for testing intervention strategies [21,22]. The prediction of leaf curl dynamics in chilli has indicated that the immigration rate of vector population is a sensitive parameter at equilibrium [11]. However, it is critical to understand the underlying mechanisms in the epidemic process. The integration of tripartite interactions in agroecological perspectives and various factors affecting migration rate and host\u2013vector contact rates is critical to understand the mechanisms that ultimately drive the epidemic. For plant viruses, the contact rate between the host and vector has not been studied in great detail. Management practices solely based on vector density, therefore, have not been successful. For mosquito-borne virus diseases, it is well established that the contact rate between the host and vector plays an important role in driving the epidemic [20,23,24]. Host\u2013vector contact dynamics play a significant role in driving the epidemic that integrates many factors eventually leading to virus transmission [20]. Therefore, it is vital to understand the vector feeding behaviour or host preference, and their application in disease control [14]. A conceptual framework assessing transmission risk is necessary to identify the relative importance of extrinsic and intrinsic drivers of risk to design and implement strategic control efforts [25\u201328]. In this paper, a prognostic evaluation of the driving parameters\u2014particularly migration rate and contact rate dynamics\u2014shows that they exert an implicitly profound effect on the epidemic process. The impact of a migrant viruliferous vector population is simulated in terms of infectious host and viruliferous vector population to implicate the importance of vector interception from the beginning of the crop growth. The prediction of the peak period of host\u2013vector contact based on the host density and growth stage preference is shown to prove that the interception of migrant carrier vectors at the early growth stage is an effective way to reduce contact rate and thereby check leaf curl epidemic. Further-\nViruses 2023, 15, 854 3 of 17\nmore, the early growth phase of plants and its conduciveness for both vector feeding and virus transmission, and their effect on plant growth rate, provides useful guidance for the development of an effective management policy."

            "text": "Conceptually, to explore and analyse the most critical parameter in the leaf curl epidemic process, tripartite interactions in the chilli\u2013whitefly\u2013virus transmission system were considered. Leaf curl epidemic as the progress of tripartite interactions was described through the population dynamic model set up [29\u201334]. Previously, leaf curl dynamics, explained and parameterized using the following set of Equation (1) to (4), were implemented for ascertaining the definite role of the major drivers of the epidemic [11]:\ndS/dt = \u2212aVS (1)\ndI/dt = aVS (2)\ndX/dt = cX + cV \u2212 bXI/(Kx + X) \u2212 uV + ix \u2212 ex (3)\ndV/dt = bXI/(Kx +X) + iv \u2212 ev \u2212 uV = b(1 \u2212 V)I/(Kx +1 \u2212 V) + iv \u2212 ev \u2212 uV (4)\nHere, virus transmission between host and vector is dependent on parameters a (transmission coefficient or inoculation rate) and b (acquisition rate). Parameter a determines the transfer rate of the healthy host (S) into the infectious category (I) and is dependent on the number of healthy hosts (S) and viruliferous vector population (V). Parameter b determines the transfer rate of the healthy vector (X), which is dependent on the number of healthy vectors (X) and the number of available infectious hosts (I). Other parameters included in the model are the rate of immigration and emigration of viruliferous (iv and ev, respectively) and healthy (ix and ex, respectively) vectors, c and u birth and death rate, respectively (for both healthy and viruliferous), and Michaelis\u2013Menten constant (Kx). Hypothetically, to mimic the effect of the migrant viruliferous vector population, three levels of immigration rate were evaluated to observe the changes in leaf curl epidemic in terms of infectious host and viruliferous vector population. Models explaining tripartite interactions were implemented in the Simulink environment (MATLAB 2021a, Mathworks, Natticks, MT, USA) and displayed in Figure 1. The model was also implemented and uploaded github repositores (https://github.com/9873018656, accessed on 30 March 2022). Parameters a, b, iv, and ev, c, u, and Kx estimated and adjusted by Roy et al. (2021a) [11], were used for the purpose of simulation (Supplementary Table S1). A sensitivity analysis was performed to determine the robustness of the model assessment by examining the extent to which the epidemic is affected by changes in values of the parameter, particularly the rate of the migrant viruliferous vector population. The rate of change in the infectious host population (I) was assessed by calculating the derivative (dI/div), i.e., the rate of change in I in terms of the change in the number of migrant viruliferous vectors; otherwise, the rate of immigration of viruliferous vector iv."

Every week, one to leaf from each of the 50 plants was checked through a PCR test for ChiLCV detection (Supplementary Table S2). Weekly leaf sampling for PCR tests was carried out from the very first week of transplantation and continued until the 15th week. For covered plots, leaf samples were collected after the 14-, 21-, and 30-day cover period was over. To assess the effect of complete interception (plant cover) on the epidemic, the survival time S(t) for the plants remaining infection free was estimated based on a Kaplan\u2013Meier curve (1956) using software SPSS 20.0. Since observ tion (PCR test) was continued only until the 15th week, the data were in the right censored type. The plants showing PCR positive were marked as an event that had occurred. The survival function S(t) described the probability of a plant remaining uninfected longer than t, and this was defined as S(t)\nViruses 2023, 15, 854 5 of 17\n= Pr (T > t), where T is the time until the leaf samples showed PCR positive for ChiLCV. Survival time S(t) was estimated using the equation:\nS(t) = k\n\u220f j=1\n( nj \u2212 dj\nnj\n)\nnj = number of individual healthy leaves just before time tj; dj = number of individual leaves PCR positive for the virus at tj for tk < t < t(k + 1) where k = 1,2, . . . ,r. A log-rank test was performed to assess whether the Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curves from the subpopulations of various plant cover periods differ significantly from each other. To explain the relationship between survival time and different interception periods, the Cox proportional hazard model was used [35]. The Cox model was expressed by the hazard function denoted by h(t) to interpret as the risk of becoming infected at time t (week).\nh(t) = h0(t) \u00d7 exp(\u03b2X)\nwhere t represents the survival time; h(t) is the hazard function determined by a single covariate (X = effect of interception); \u03b2 is the coefficient as a measure of the impact of the effect size of covariate X; h0(t) is the baseline hazard and corresponds to the value of the hazard if X equal to zero. The quantity exp (\u03b2) is called the hazard ratio (HR); HR > 1 indicates an increase in hazard with time; <1 decrease in hazard and =1 no effect."

            "text": "For an approximation of contact rate, a mechanistic model explained for mosquito\u2013 virus transmission was adopted which estimates vector feeding or predation rate based on host density [20,25]. Contact rate is explicitly defined in the transfer or inoculation rate (a) and denoted as the force of infection in Equations (1) and (2):\ndI/dt = aVS = aV(1 \u2212 I)\na = bvh \u00d7 (Iv/Nh) \u00d7 vh;\nwhere bvh = per capita contact rate that a vector experiences (feeding or predation rate) dependent on host density. It is initially low and increases gradually; Iv/Nh =proportion of bites that are from a viruliferous vector (for well-mixed population Iv/Nh) dependent on the number of viruliferous vectors; and vh = proportion of bites that results in host infection. Contact rate as a component of feeding rate was estimated based on a mechanistic model derived from the ecological theory called functional response [25\u201327]:\ny(x) = A\u00d7 x/(1 + A\u00d7 Th \u00d7 x) (5)\nHere, the feeding or predation rate, y(x), is the vector\u2019s per capita feeding rate; A is the vector\u2019s search rate (also called discovery rate), and x is host density (number of hosts per unit area). The \u2018handling time\u2019 per host, Th, includes the average time a vector spends interacting with the host, biting the host, and sucking after biting, which is equivalent to inoculation access and feeding period [19,27]. The approach is a compromise between density-dependent and frequency-dependent transmission [25].\n2.6.1. Estimation of Host Density (Number of Leaves and Area) and Succulence Level\nThe susceptible genotype (cv HPH-1041) was raised in a greenhouse chamber to avoid virus infection and vector. Seeds were sown in rectangular pots (80 \u00d7 40 cm) with soil media (3/4 garden soil and 14 organic manure with optimum NPK level). One-month-old seedlings were transplanted in 30 rectangular pots (80 \u00d7 40 cm) to maintain about 130\u2013140 plants for observation. The number of leaves was counted from the first week of transplantation, and the weekly mean from 10 plants was estimated. For the estimation of leaf area, the total leaf area of 4\u20136 plants were measured from RGB images (JPEG) captured through a scanner (dpi 250). Leaf area was measured precisely using image analysis software Assess 2.0 (APS,\nViruses 2023, 15, 854 7 of 17\nPaul, MN, USA). To assess the dynamics of leaf number and leaf area, logistic model (Y) was fitted to find the inflection point.\nY(t) = c/(1 + b exp(\u2212a \u00d7 t)) (6)\nwhere Y indicates the proportion of leaf number and leaf area (mm2); model parameters c = maximum carrying capacity for leaf number/plant or area/plant; a= apparent rate of growth in leaf number; b = c/X (0)\u20131. Parameter estimates for leaf number and leaf area were determined using SPSS 16.0. Leaf succulence (LS) was estimated by measuring leaf fresh weight (FLW) and then dry, and (DW) and LS was expressed [40,41]:\nLS = (FLW \u2212 DW)/area (7)\nEstimates of the feeding or predation rate y(x) or the vector\u2019s per capita feeding rate was a straight line, which is unrealistic in natural situations. Therefore, y(x) values were corrected by multiplying with the succulence level and expressed as:\ny (x) = A \u00d7 x/(1 + A \u00d7 Th \u00d7 x) \u00d7 LS (8)\n2.6.2. Plant Age and Virus Transmission Potential\nThe relationship between plant age and infection proportion over a period of time (from the time of inoculation up to the 10th week from transplantation) was assessed to indicate transmission potential. For the assessment of plant age in relation to proportion of infection, a semi-controlled experiment was conducted on the susceptible chilli cultivar (HPH-1041). Seedlings of six successive ages, indicated by the number of leaves, were raised by sowing at weekly intervals. For virus inoculation, four sets of seedlings of different ages (2, 4, 8 and 12leaves) were transplanted in polyethylene pots (dia. 12 cm) and kept under insect-proof cages. Three plants in each set were inoculated with 10 viruliferous whiteflies and maintained at 25 \u25e6C to ensure maximum inoculation by the vector [42]. Whiteflies were killed after 48 h by spraying insecticide (@1 mL/L of Confidor, Bayer). The weekly proportion of infection, appropriated as transmission potential in each category, was estimated by testing the leaf samples for ChiLCV. For specific PCR-detection, three top leaves from each of three plants were collected, and the proportion of ChiLCV infection was estimated following the scheme given in Supplementary Table S2. To calculate the proportion of infected leaf (P), the maximum likelihood procedure was used [42\u201345]:\nP = 1 \u2212 ((n \u2212 X)/n)1/m\nwhere n = number of groups made for leaf samples; m = number of leaves in each group; X = number of groups tested as PCR-positive."

            "text": "For leaf curl disease in chilli, tripartite interactions between host, vector, and virus, which collectively determine the dynamics of host\u2013vector contact rates, were evaluated and tested to improve management strategy. The interception of the migrant vector population to minimize the contact rate proved to be the cornerstone of the disease management strategy. The time taken for disease appearance with visible symptoms and virus detection indicates that the early plant growth phase is prone to most vectors generally associated with chilli leaf curl syndrome (thrips and mites). Feeding rate prediction and its approximation as a component of contact rate dynamics in chilli were influenced by host growth, particularly succulence level. Further, a decrease in the proportion of infection with plant age also indicated that early plant growth stage is the most vulnerable stage, as supported by the contact rate dynamics. Therefore, an interception from the early period is expected to ensure a no or low level of the epidemic to maintain normal plant growth and fruit yield. The leaf curl epidemic was revealed to be initiated by the migrant vector population, which is available in the reservoirs of the agroecosystem, and solely contributes to increasing the infectious host as well as the viruliferous vector population in the field. A positive feedback mechanism is in operation where few viruliferous migrant vectors produce few infectious hosts, which in turn, facilitate more viruliferous vectors; this process continues so long as the availability of susceptible host sites is ensured [46,47]. Feeding rate appropriated as contact rate contributes to both virus acquisition and transfers to the host from the time of leaf emergence to the peak level of succulence. An initial low feeding rate is justified by the low host density and increase in rate at a later stage as host density increases. However, the decrease in feeding rate is subsequently modified by the succulence level. The preference of greenhouse whiteflies has been reported to vary with different species of host plants and leaves of different ages, but they mostly prefer the younger leaves [14]. Contact between viruliferous vectors and hosts have been reported to be the crucial step for epidemic development [17,18]. A low or no contact rate is only possible by preventing vector access into the field. Thus, vector interception through plant cover or by any means could ensure epidemic control. The complete avoidance of initial contact between migrant vectors and the healthy host prevents the gradual and simultaneous building of the interdependent population. As the gradual build-up of both infectious host and vector starts at the early crop stage, the complete prevention of migrant vectors at the start of chilli planting is expected to deter contact between the two populations, and thus, maintain a low level of virus transmission. The prevention of the infectious vector\u2019s entry from the beginning or complete avoidance of migrant vectors from the crop start may be possible by covering the rows with synthetic plant covers that prevent insects without interfering with plant growth. A precise intervention time that ensures low contact rates resulting in a smaller proportion of infectious hosts is a clue for the evolution of tactics in management strategies [19]. The early plant growth phase is prone to vectors or pests associated with chilli leaf curl disease. The early appearance of symptoms and the detection of associated leaf curl virus suggests that the early growth or succulent stage is a determinant for the visiting of pests or immigration of vectors to a freshly planted field. In agroecosystems, particularly in tropical and semitropical climates where vector reservoirs are maintained throughout the year, immigration is a common phenomenon [48]. Early physiological growth is not only severely affected by viruses, but also due to feeding by whiteflies, thrips, aphids, and mites [49]. In India, eleven viruses are reported to occur naturally on chilli; namely, ChiLCV, cucumber mosaic virus (CMV), pepper venial mottle virus (PVMV), tobacco leaf curl virus (TLCV), potato virus X (PVX), potato virus Y (PVY), tobacco ring spot virus (TRSV), pepper vein banding virus (PVBV), tomato leaf curl New Delhi virus (ToLCNDV), chilli mosaic virus, and capsicum chlorosis virus [1,49,50]. In the current study, although observations were only made for whitefly-transmitted ChiLCV, it may also be applicable to other vectors. Plants kept under complete cover are shown to be devoid of all symptoms except mite injuries. However, remaining completely free of leaf curl symptoms under plant cover and seed treatment (with miticide) indicates that mite injury is a component of leaf curl\nViruses 2023, 15, 854 15 of 17\nsymptoms. It also appears that covered plants received protection from winged whiteflies and thrips but not from the crawling mites. The occurrence pattern of leaf curl incidence indicates that chilli plants are prone to infection from all pests at the early growth stage, probably due to a feeding preference for host succulence. Covering plants for around 26 days as an optimum period essentially reduced the initial contact rate and ensured the avoidance of high feeding rate exposure until 6 weeks after transplantation. Location-based trials with plant covers can be standardized, as migrant vector populations may vary depending on the agroecosystems. The reduction in virus transmission with plant age affirms that a short interception period at a critical stage is crucial, as the later stage automatically has less potential for transmission. Further, greater plant growth in symptom-free plants under plant cover strongly suggested that the early protection of chilli plants is crucial to attaining fruit yield. Leaf curl infection reduces the leaf area index, and thus, affects radiation use efficiency and the low accumulation of photosynthates [51]. It thereby impairs the translocation of metabolites, resulting in abnormality at the cell/tissue level, and reduces carbon uptake and soluble assimilates, ultimately impairing crop growth [51,52]. To summarise, the time of host\u2013vector contact is a crucial meeting point where multiple influencing factors interact and give rise to leaf curl infection, knowledge of which has been identified as critically lacking. The migrant vectors, as the primary drivers of the ChiLCV epidemic, and the contact rate, as the function of host density and succulence, have been proved and translated into rules for the evaluation of a management strategy. In the future, location-based trials with plant covers can be standardized, as migrant vector populations may vary depending on the agroecosystems. Moreover, future improvements in the epidemiologically focused management of ChiLCV should also consider other factors affecting contact and virus acquisition rate (i.e., bite exposure rate, as per Thongsripong et al., 2021) [20], the effect of plant canopies and physiology, the varietal preference of whiteflies to chilli, and environmental factors affecting vector feeding behaviour as well as reproduction. Such studies will further narrow the view of researchers to assess management choices and determine the best option to contain the epidemic spread of the disease.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/v15040854/s1, Table S1: Model parameters and variables used for leaf curl epidemic analysis in chili; Table S2: Sampling procedure for estimation of proportion of infection in leaf and whitefly population through PCR detection of ChiLCV.\nAuthor Contributions: B.R.: The overall execution of all experiments, observation and data collection.
