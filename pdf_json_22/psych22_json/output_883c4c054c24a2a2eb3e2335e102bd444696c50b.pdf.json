This study aimed to establish a nomogram to predict the anxiety status of medical staff during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Methods: A total of 600 medical members were randomized 7:3 and divided into training and validation sets. The data was collected using a questionnaire. Logistic regression analysis and Akaike information criterion (AIC) were applied to investigate the risk factors for anxiety. Odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated to establish a nomogram. Results: Participation time (OR=44.28, 95% CI=13.13~149.32), rest time (OR=38.50, 95% CI=10.43~142.19), epidemic prevention area (OR=10.16, 95% CI=3.51~29.40), epidemic prevention equipment (OR=15.24, 95% CI=5.73~40.55), family support (OR=9.63, 95% CI=3.55~26.11), colleague infection (OR=6.25, 95% CI=2.18~19.11), and gender (OR=3.30, 95% CI=1.15~9.47) were the independent risk factors (P<0.05) for anxiety in medical staff. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves of the training and validation sets were 0.987 and 0.946, respectively. The decision curve\u2019s net benefit shows the nomogram\u2019s clinical utility. Conclusion: The nomogram established in this study exhibited an excellent ability to predict anxiety status with sufficient discriminatory power and calibration. Our findings provide a protocol for predicting and identifying anxiety status in medical staff during the COVID-19 pandemic. Keywords: nomogram, anxiety, COVID-19, medical staff"

            "text": "The COVID-19 outbreak has caused widespread psychological distress among the public. The unexpected nature of the illness, home isolation and confinement, a lack of clarity from authorities about the severity of the risk, or individual emotional spillover are all risk factors for this rise.1,2 The psychological burden is exceptionally high among medical personnel, who face additional group-specific demands.3 Long work hours, strict instructions and safety procedures, a constant need for focus and alertness, restricted social connection, and participation in tasks for which they may not be trained are all examples of exceptionally high job-related stressors.4,5 These stressors have been linked to medical personnel\u2019s emotional distress during the COVID-19 pandemic, which may have become a source of anxiety.6,7 According to recent research, medical professionals may be experiencing the highest levels of anxiety8 because they are often responsible for treating COVID-19 patients and are more psychologically stressed.

People who work in fields like \u201chealth\u201d, which directly benefit people and place a premium on interpersonal relationships, are more likely to experience burnout.9,10 Anxiety is a risk factor for job burnout.11\u201313 In addition, medical staffs are prone to anxiety when encountering emergencies.10,14\u201316 Since December 2019, novel coronavirus pneumonia (COVID-19) has broken and swept worldwide.17\nPhysicians, nurses, and other healthcare professionals who have frequent contact with patients may experience stress, anxiety, and burnout, which may impair their ability to perform their jobs, deteriorate their health and lower their quality of life. When it comes to healthcare workers, the anxiety that develops during or after a crisis intervention may affect their capacity for abstract thought, mental reasoning, and coordination. Their ability to solve problems can be impacted by various emotions, including fear and anxiety. Reduced problem-solving skills could result in less effective services being offered to safeguard public health, improve living conditions, and protect individual health.7,18,19\nTherefore, it is significantly necessary to identify and predict anxiety in medical staff early, which contributes to reasonable and optimized medical staff configuration during COVID-19 pandemic. Herein, a cross-sectional study was conducted to identify anxiety in medical staff during epidemic prevention and mediating risk factors. Study employed a questionnaire collecting the data of participants, which included basic information (age, gender, marital status, occupation, professional title, hospital level, educational background), information relevant to work against COVID-19 (workplace, participation time, convenience of traffic, case of colleague infection, family supports as well as sufficient or insufficient mask, isolation clothes and salary) and Hamilton anxiety scale. Following data generated from respondents, a nomogram was established and validated internally and externally. Results in this study showed that the nomogram exhibits an excellent ability to predict anxiety status with sufficient discriminatory power and calibration. Therefore, in line with the preceding points, our proposed model may provide a protocol for anticipating and detecting anxiety in medical personnel during the COVID-19 pandemic."

The inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) medical personnels were on duty, and they were working in the fever clinics, isolation wards and quarantine hotels, and engaging in pre-inspection and quarantine; (2) the time for medical staff to engage themselves in epidemic prevention and control was no less than two weeks.\nExclusion Criteria: medical staff who were not involved in the battle against the COVID-19 epidemic and those who did not cooperate with the questionnaire.\nData Collection The basic information and relevant data of included medical staff who participated in the epidemic prevention of the COVID-19 pandemic in China from February 1st, 2020, to May 30th, 2020, were collected through a questionnaire. Questionnaires were distributed randomly to included medical staff by two investigators. The recording and collation of obtained data were in charge of a specially-assigned person. The quality control of the entered data was supervised by two investigators each other to ensure integrity and authenticity.\nNomogram Establishment and Validation Included cases were randomized 7:3 and divided into a training set of 420 and a validation set of 180 cases. Logistic regression analysis was applied to investigate the risk factors for anxiety. Next, the independent risk factors for anxiety were identified based on the Akaike information criterion (AIC). The odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were calculated and a nomogram model was established. The established nomogram was assessed by discrimination and calibration and validated internally and externally using the training and validation sets. The area evaluated the discrimination ability of the nomogram under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve. The area under the ROC curve ranges from 0.5 to 1.0, with 0.5 ~ 0.7, 0.7 ~ 0.85 and 0.85 ~ 0.95 indicating low, fair\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/JMDH.S385060 DovePress Journal of Multidisciplinary Healthcare 2022:15 2726\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nand high predictive value, respectively. The accuracy of the constructed nomogram was assessed by a calibration plot (ie, the comparison of nomogram-predicted probabilities and actual anxiety in medical staff). The close value of predicted probabilities to standard curve indicated positive predictive value and high accuracy. The decision curve analysis (DCA) was used to analyze the net benefit of the nomogram and assess the clinical utility.\nStatistical Analysis Enumeration data were expressed as the number of cases and constituent ratio, and the chi-square test and Fisher\u2019s exact test were used to compare groups. All statistical analyses were conducted using Stata15 software, and the nomogram was constructed using R software. All reported P values were two-sided and P-value <0.05 was statistically considered significant."

A total of 258 cases were identified as anxious according to the criteria of Anxiety (Hamilton Anxiety Scale scored > 14), and the incidence rate of anxiety was 43%. This high incidence rate of anxiety indicates excessive perceived stress of a person.\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nLogistic Regression Analysis Anxiety or non-anxiety was the outcome and logistic regression analysis was performed. The variance inflation factors (less than 5) indicated the collinearity between the various variables and the eligibility for logistic regression analysis. Univariate logistic regression analysis on the training set showed that participation time, rest time, epidemic prevention area, epidemic prevention equipment, family support, colleague infection, gender and years of work were risk factors for Anxiety (P < 0.05) (Table 2). Multivariate logistic regression analysis demonstrated that participation time (OR=44.28, 95% CI=13.13~149.32), rest time (OR=38.50, 95% CI=10.43~142.19), epidemic prevention area (OR=10.16, 95% CI=3.51~29.40), epidemic prevention equipment (OR=15.24, 95% CI=5.73~40.55), family support (OR=9.63, 95% CI=3.55~26.11), colleague infection (OR=6.25, 95% CI=2.18~19.11), gender (OR=3.30, 95% CI=1.15~9.47) were the independent risk factors for anxiety (P < 0.05, minimized AIC=137.39) (Table 3)."

Firstly, there is a difference in the area under the ROC curve between the training and validation sets. Therefore, a more optimal prediction model can be constructed by increasing the sample size in a cross-sectional survey. Secondly, the established nomogram is limited to predicting the anxiety status of Chinese medical staff, because the data collected in this study are from within the territory of China."
