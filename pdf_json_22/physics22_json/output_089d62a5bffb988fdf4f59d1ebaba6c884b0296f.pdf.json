    "abstractText": "We present a microscopic model for a singly charged quantum dot (QD) ensemble to reveal the origin of the long-range effective interaction between the electron spins in the QDs. Wilson\u2019s numerical renormalization group (NRG) is used to calculate the magnitude and the spatial dependency of the effective spin-spin interaction mediated by the growth induced wetting layer. Surprisingly, we found an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg coupling for very short inter-QD distances that is caused by the significant particle-hole asymmetry of the wetting layer band at very low filling. Using the NRG results obtained from realistic parameters as input for a semiclassical simulation for a large QD ensemble, we demonstrate that the experimentally reported phase shifts in the coherent spin dynamics between single and two color laser pumping can be reproduced by our model, solving a longstanding mystery of the microscopic origin of the inter QD electron spin-spin interaction.",

Anders Department of Physics, TU Dortmund University,\nOtto-Hahn-Stra\u00dfe 4, 44227 Dortmund, Germany\n(Dated: July 20, 2022)\nWe present a microscopic model for a singly charged quantum dot (QD) ensemble to reveal the origin of the long-range effective interaction between the electron spins in the QDs. Wilson\u2019s numerical renormalization group (NRG) is used to calculate the magnitude and the spatial dependency of the effective spin-spin interaction mediated by the growth induced wetting layer. Surprisingly, we found an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg coupling for very short inter-QD distances that is caused by the significant particle-hole asymmetry of the wetting layer band at very low filling. Using the NRG results obtained from realistic parameters as input for a semiclassical simulation for a large QD ensemble, we demonstrate that the experimentally reported phase shifts in the coherent spin dynamics between single and two color laser pumping can be reproduced by our model, solving a longstanding mystery of the microscopic origin of the inter QD electron spin-spin interaction.\nSpins confined in semiconductor QDs have been discussed as candidates for implementation of quantum bits (qubits) in quantum information technologies [1, 2] since it allows integration into conventional semiconductor logic elements. For information processing, qubit initialization and readout [3, 4] are as important as manipulations of the spins. Optical control experiments in QD ensembles [5, 6] as well as the measurements of the dephasing time as function of the laser spectral width [7] in such samples provided strong evidence for a longrange electron spin-spin interactions between the different QDs in the ensemble of unknown microscopic origin. Initially, it was speculated [5] that it might be caused by an optically induced [8] Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction [9\u201311]. Since the laser pulse duration is of the order of ps such an optically induced interaction, however, would decay rather rapidly and is not compatible with the observed spin coherence on a scale of several ns.\nIn order to make use of the intrinsic long range spinspin interaction between the localized spins in QDs by spin manipulation protocols, its origin needs to be understood. In this letter, we propose a microscopic mechanism based on the analysis of a multi-impurity Anderson model [12\u201314]. We start from a localized electron bound state in each QD that weakly hybridize with the conduction band (CB) of the thin wetting layer (WL) [15\u2013 17] that is left below the QDs in the Stranski-Krastanow growth protocol. The basic setup is sketched in Fig. 1. By including all virtual charge fluctuations in the leading order, significant corrections to the conventional textbook expression starting from an effective local moment picture have been reported [12, 18] for short distances. We believe that implementing backgates below the WL would allow to manipulate the properties of the low concentration WL electron gas and hence to control the effective spin-spin interaction.\nRecently a growth procedure for InGaAs QD ensembles\nwas proposed [19] to eliminate the WL. In such samples, the effective spin-spin interaction between the QD electron spins should be absent. While those types of QD ensembles are produced to decrease the energy loss when used as photon emitters, a detailed investigation of their spin properties in electron doped samples is still missing to the best of our knowledge. Model.\u2014 The WL is treated as a free two-dimensional\nCB\nHWL = \u2211\n~k\n~ 2~k2 2m\u2217 c\u2020~k\u03c3 c~k\u03c3 (1)\nin the isotropic effective mass approximation with m\u2217/m0 = 0.023 [20]. The minimal model for the NQD QDs in the ensemble is given by\nHQD =\nNQD \u2211\ni\n(\n\u2211\n\u03c3\n\u03b5di d \u2020 i\u03c3di\u03c3 + Uin d i\u2191n d i\u2193\n)\n, (2)\nwhere \u03b5di denotes the single particle energy of the bound electron state with spin \u03c3 in the i-th QD and Ui the corresponding Coulomb repulsion preventing the bound state to be doubly occupied. The creation (annihilation) operator d\u2020i\u03c3(di\u03c3) adds (removes) an electron to (from) the i-th QD. The electronic wave function is localized but covers the whole diameter of the QD. The parameters Ui and \u03b5 d i depend on the individual shape of the QD.\n2 Using the experimental estimates [21], we approximate Ui \u2248 4meV for a QD with a diameter D = 25nm. The concentration of the donors in the QD ensemble\nused in Ref. [5] was selected to match the QD density in the sample. Each QD can capture at least one electron if the bound state \u03b5di is below the CB of the WL. It remains empty when the chemical potential \u00b5 < \u03b5di . Spin spectroscopy experiments [22], however, indicate that not all QDs are filled with one electron. This might be due to local imperfections that shift individual \u03b5di to higher energies. Also doubly occupied QD states are possible when \u03b5di < \u00b5\u2212Ui. Excluding this doubly occupied QD ground state configuration puts a lower bound on \u03b5di . We assume that a fraction qWL of the total donor excess electrons is filling up the WL such that the chemical potential \u00b5 > 0 lies within the CB of the WL. The upper bound of the chemical potential \u00b5 = \u03b5F is reached for qWL = 1 yielding \u03b5F \u2248 1meV for a dot density of 10\n10cm\u22122[5]. The bound state of the i-th QD can tunnel with a finite tunneling amplitude V im into the Wannier orbital m of the WL. The resulting hybridization term between the bound state of each QD and the WL takes the form\nHhyb =\nNQD \u2211\ni=1\n\u2211\n\u03c3\n\u2211\nm\n(\nV imd \u2020 i\u03c3cm\u03c3 + h.c.\n)\n, (3)\nwhere cm\u03c3 is the annihilation operator of the Wannier orbital at site ~Rm of the 2D WL and whose spatial Fourier transform is c~k\u03c3. The total Hamiltonian of the coupled QD problem is given by H = HWL +HQD +Hhyb which is just a realization of a multi-impurity problem [13]. The effect of the WL onto the dynamics of the localized\nQD states is determined by the hybridization function matrix [12, 13]\n\u2206ij(z) = \u2211\nlm\n1\nN\n\u2211\n~k\n[V il ] \u2217V jme\ni~k(~Rm\u2212~Rl)\nz \u2212 \u03b5~k . (4)\nIn the wide band limit, i. e. V0/D \u226a 1 where D is the band width of the WL CB, tij = \u211c\u2206ij(\u00b5) generates an effective hopping between the QDs i and j. The averaged distance between the QDs is of the same order of magnitude as the Fermi wave length \u03bbF . The distance variations between the WL sites, however, are small compared to \u03bbF . Consequently, we can replace ~Rm\u2212 ~Rl by the distance between the two centers of the QDs, i. e. ~Ri \u2212 ~Rj , and include the spatial extension of the QD [23] by defining V\u0304i = \u2211 m V i m. We introduce the average hybridization matrix element V 20 = \u3008V\u0304 2 i \u3009 and define a reference energy scale \u03930 = \u03c0V 2 0 \u03c10, \u03c10 being the constant density of state of the 2D WL CB. The charge fluctuation scale \u03930 determines the order of magnitude of \u2206ij(z). The antiferromagnetic (AF) part of the RKKY interaction can be estimated [12, 13] as JRKKYAF,ij \u2248 4t 2 ij/U \u221d 4\u0393 2 0/U serving as a first estimate for \u03930 \u2248 10\u2212 100\u00b5eV. In a conventional metal, the AF part of the RKKY\ninteraction is compensated by the FM contribution for\n|~R| \u2192 0 [18, 24]. The relevant parameter regime of our model, however, does not fit the conventional regime discussed in the literature where D,U > J\u0304K , J\u0304K being the averaged local Heisenberg coupling JK between the QD electron spin and the local CB spin density [25]. The energy \u03b5di is located below the lower band edge of the CB. Many Wannier orbitals contribute to V\u0304i, and virtual charge fluctuations in the localized orbitals below the CB continuum are allowed. We expect deviations between the correct effective spin-spin interaction within our model and the prediction from the conventional two stage mapping of the QD model: first onto a Kondo ensemble model by applying a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation (SWT) [26] that is O(V 20 ) followed by a perturbative estimation of the JRKKYij [25] in O(V 4 0 ). Significant corrections to JRKKYij have been already reported [12, 18] at short distances since additional terms in O(V 40 ) neglected in the two stage mapping become important.\nNumerical renormalization group approach.\u2014 To circumvent the inconsistency problem of the two stage perturbative approach, we apply the numerical renormalization group (NRG) [27, 28] to the Hamiltonian with NQD = 2 to determine the distance dependent effective Heisenberg interaction between the localized electron spins. For each distance R = |~R1 \u2212 ~R2|, the two QD problem is mapped onto an effective two band model [12, 24, 29], where we used \u03930, \u00b5 = \u03b5F and \u03b5 d i = \u03b5\nd as the adjustable parameters such that each QD remains singly charged. Note that the NRG mapping of the strong asymmetric bands onto a Wilson chain [27, 28] leads to modification of the hopping parameters [30] and of the NRG fixed point (FP) spectrum [31]. This adjustment only depends on the support of the CB density of states and, therefore, is independent of the QD distance R.\nUsing the NRG, we calculated the temperature dependent spin-spin correlation function \u3008~S1~S2\u3009(T,R) as shown for two distances in Fig. 2(a). The sign of \u3008~S1~S2\u3009(T,R) determines the sign of JNRGRKKY(R), and |J NRG RKKY(R)| is obtained from the fit to the universal functions of the spin-spin correlation function of a s = 1/2 toy model, S12(T ) = \u00b5 2 eff(e\n\u2212\u03b2J \u2212 1)/(1 + 3e\u2212\u03b2J), where the parameter \u00b52eff includes possible Kondo screening effects of the localized spins [32]. We added the fit functions as solid lines to Fig. 2(a). The extracted JNRGRKKY(R) = J are shown in Fig. 2(b) for different fixed set of parameters.\nFor two localized moments coupled by a Heisenberg interaction JK to the local spin-density of 2D CB with a quadratic dispersion in 2D, Klein and Fischer [25] derived the analytic expression\nJRKKYij = \u2212\u03c10J\u0304 2 K v\u0304k2F 4\u03c0\n(5)\n\u00d7 [J0(kFR)N0(kFR) + J1(kFR)N1(kFR)]\nfor the effective RKKY interaction, where Jl(x)(Nl(x)) is the Bessel (Neumann) function of order l and v\u0304 the area\n3 10\u22128 10\u22126 10\u22124 10\u22122 100\nTkB/meV\n\u22120.75\n\u22120.50\n\u22120.25\n0.00 0.25 \u3008S 1 \u00b7 S 2 \u3009\n(a)\nRkF /\u03c0 = 2.24 fit: J =\u22120.2147 \u00b5eV RkF /\u03c0 = 1.74 fit: J =0.2832 \u00b5eV\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5\nR \u00b7 kF /\u03c0\n\u221220\n0\n20\n40\nJ N R G\nR K K Y (R\n) \u00b7 U\n2 / (\u0393\n2 0 \u00b7 \u03b5 F\n)\n(b)\n\u03930 = 0.07meV, \u03b5F = 0.5meV, U = 4meV \u03930 = 0.07meV, \u03b5F = 0.3meV, U = 4meV \u03930 = 0.14meV, \u03b5F = 0.5meV, U = 4meV \u03930 = 0.14meV, \u03b5F = 0.3meV, U = 4meV \u03930 = 1.25meV, \u03b5F = 0.5meV, U = 40meV fit for \u03930 = 0.14meV, \u03b5F = 0.5meV,U = 4meV\nFIG. 2. NRG results: (a) \u3008~S1 ~S2\u3009(T,R) vs T for two distances R and the fit to an interacting two spin model for extracting J . (b) JNRGRKKY(R)/(\u0393 2 0\u03b5F ) vs RkF /\u03c0 for different \u03930 and \u03b5F . We added a fit to Eq. (5) as solid magenta line.

(5) to our NRG data as solid magenta line in Fig. 2(b). The NRG results follow excellently the analytic predictions for larger distances. The magnitude of JNRGRKKY(R) is proportional to \u039320\u03b5F as expected, but the absolut value differs for those predicted by Eq. (5). JNRGRKKY(R) remains invariant under rescaling \u03b1\u03930, \u03b1U, \u03b1\u03b5\nd for RkF /\u03c0 > 0.5. For short distances, RkF /\u03c0 < 0.25, however, we observe significant deviations: The NRG reveals an AF RKKY interaction in contrary to the conventional RKKY result. The origin of this surprising effect can be linked to the large effective single-particle hopping between the QD orbitals induced by the very strong particle-hole asymmetry of the CB for small WL fillings. The conventional two stages perturbation theory is inconsistent and requires additional corrections in O(V 40 ) [12, 18].\nSpin polarization in laser pulsed QD ensembles.\u2014 After establishing the distance dependent effective interaction between the electron spins in the different QDs, we investigate its influence on an ensemble of singly charged QD in an external magnetic field subject to a two color laser pumping with circularly polarized light [5]. We used a semiclassical simulation [33, 34] for the spin dynamics\nof a QD ensemble model [7]\nHarray =\nNQD \u2211\ni\nH (i) 1 +\n\u2211\ni<j\nJij ~S (i)~S(j), (6)\nwhere the central spin model (CSM) H (i) 1 ,\nH (i) 1 =g (i) e \u00b5B ~Bext~S (i) +\nNi \u2211\nk=1\ng (i) N,k\u00b5N ~Bext~I (i) k\n+\nNi \u2211\nk=1\nA (i) k ~I (i) k ~S(i), (7)\nincludes the electron and nuclear Zeeman term in the external magnetic field ~Bext as well as the hyperfine coupling between the Ni nuclei spins denoted by ~I (i) k and the electron spin ~S(i) [35\u201339]. We generated random 2D ensembles of NQD QDs with a dot density of 10\n10cm\u22122 [5] and assigned Jij = xixjJ NRG RKKY(R, \u03b5F ,\u03930) from the NRG data depicted in Fig. 2(b) where xi accounts for the variations of V\u0304i. We attributed NQD/2 randomly selected QDs to be resonant to one of the two different laser frequencies and, therefore, also assigned the corresponding g (i) e . We set the average g\u0304e = 0.55, the ratios between the two subsets g1e/g 2 e = 1.03, and z = g\u0304e\u00b5B/(g\u0304N\u00b5N ) = 1/800.\nWe run three different types of semiclassical simulations for the spin dynamics with Ik = 3/2 nuclear spins: (i) a box model with Ak = A0 = const., NQD = 10000, and Ni = 10\n6 nuclear spins, (ii) a simulation for a frozen nuclear spin dynamics (FOA) [36] for NQD = 10000 and Ni as in (i) and (iii) an Ak distribution with NQD = 1000 and Ni = 1000 including the full nuclear spin dynamics. In all cases, we kept the characteristic energy scale T \u2217 = ( \u2211\nk(A (i) k ) 2\u3008I2k \u3009) \u22121/2 = 1ns fixed. The technical\naspects of the simulation including the treatment of the laser pulse using a trion excitation cycle can be found in the literature [7, 34] which is summarized in the Supplemental Material. The experiments reported in Ref. [5] were performed\nin a transversal magnetic field of 1T, and laser pulses of two different colors were applied pumping two different resonant QD subsets. In order to reproduce one of the experimental key results, we first determined a reference curve for \u3008Sz(t)\u3009 of subset 1 subjected to a circular polarized laser pulse at t = 0 that shows damped coherent oscillations characterized by the Larmor frequency. Then we run the same setup but apply a second circular polarized laser pulse with a color resonating with subset 2 at a moment when \u3008Sz(t)\u3009 of subset 1 reached a minimum, i. e. at a delay of \u2206t \u2248 0.111ns. We tracked the relative phase shifts of the coherent os-\ncillations between the reference curve \u3008Sz(t)\u3009 and those in the presence of a laser pulse onto subset 2. The sign of the phase shift depends only on the relative sign of the circular polarization. The result is plotted in Fig. 3.\n4 0 1 2\n\u2206t (ns)\n0\n\u03c0 2\n\u03c0 \u03c6\nBox-Model\nAk Distribution FOA (\u03b4x = 0)\nFOA (\u03b4x = 0.2)\nFOA (U = 40meV)\nExperiment\nFIG. 3. Phase shift \u03c6 in the coherent electron spin oscillation between a single color pumping reference curve and a two color laser pumped QD ensemble. The experimental data are taken from Ref. [5], the simulations are for Ak = const. (box model), a frozen Overhauser field approximation (FOA) including some disorder of the xj as well as a distribution of the Ak.\nAs in the experiment, the phase shift increases roughly linearly in time. The slope is determined by overall magnitude of JRKKYij (R). The results that resembles the experiments the best were obtained for \u03930 = 140\u00b5eV and \u03b5F = 0.5meV corresponding to qWL = 0.5 and U/\u03930 = 29. Leaving the ratio U/\u03930 = 29 fixed, we can also reproduce the experimental phase shifts with \u03930 = 1.25meV, \u03b5\nd = \u221215meV, U = 40meV indicating the physics is driven by an effective lokal Kondo coupling [26] plus corrections in O(V 40 ) for short distances. Note that the individual hybridization strength between the bound electron QD state and the local Wannier orbital remains small and is of the order V im = 10\u221240 \u00b5eV. Only by the summation to V\u0304i, a significant contribution arises.\nWe run the simulation for fixed xi = 1 and for the FOA additional with a Gaussian normal distribution with \u03b4x = 0.2 to reveal the influence of the local derivation of the QD hybridization matrix element from its average value. The phase shifts are nearly independent of the distribution of local hybridization matrix elements V\u0304i. The major disorder contributions stems from the randomly distribution of distances to the neighbouring QDs. As a result, each QD senses a slightly different effective coupling converting the quadratic increase of the phase shift in a two QD model to a linear increase for short times. Tracking the full dynamics of the Overhauser field is not required on the time scale of 3 ns: The frozen Overhauser approximation and the case A (i) k = A0 yields the almost same results as the full nuclear spin dynamics but with a reduced NQD. We also run the simulation for a JRKKYij (R) after rescaling \u03930, U, \u03b5\nd with a factor of 10 to accommodate for errors in the rough parameter estimates. The slope of the phase shift \u03c6 came out about 50% to large requiring a reduction of \u03930. The origin of\nthe increase is caused by contribution of the first minimum in JRKKYij (R) at around RKF/\u03c0 \u2248 0.2 where we observe significant deviations from the analytic prediction. Overall, the simulation data agree remarkably well with the experimental findings even over a large range of parameters.\nConclusion.\u2014 In this letter, we present a QD WL model to explain the microscopic origin of the inter QD electron spin-spin interaction conjectured in Ref. [5]. We used Wilson\u2019s NRG [28] to extract the strength and distance dependency of this spin-spin interaction mediated by the WL via an RKKY based mechanism. While the long distance behavior is in agreement with the low-filling perturbative RKKY result [25], we found significant deviations for shorter distances. The unconventionally AF RKKY interaction at short distances can be connected to the large effective inter QD hopping between the QD orbitals [12, 13] as a consequence of the very low band filling. The conventional RKKY approach [25] starts already from an effective local moment picture and does not include all corrections in O(V 40 ).\nWe used our NRG data as input for a semiclassical simulation of the spin dynamics in a coupled QD ensemble which is able to reproduce the experimental phase shifts reported for two-color pumping setup [5] very accurately for a variety of different realistic parameters. Although the interaction in the effective model might appear substantial, one has to bare in mind that all WL Wannier orbital below a QD contribute in Eq. (3) only by a very weak coupling.\nOur theory solves the long standing mystery about the microscopic origin of the inter QD spin-spin interaction. We predict that this interaction can be eliminated by a QD growth process that excludes an InAs WL [19]. By gating the 2D WL, it might be possible to modulate the 2D electron gas and, therefore, control the effective Heisenberg interactions JRKKYij (R) by a change of gate voltage.\nThe authors would like to thank fruitful discussions with Alex Greilich who also provided the experimental raw data of Ref.
