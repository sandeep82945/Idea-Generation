INTRODUCTION\nEntropy is a fundamental thermodynamic quantity that describes the state of a many-body system and governs its thermoelectric, thermomagnetic, and heat transport properties. However, the total entropy of the system is hard to measure directly, while the differential entropy per particle is accessible for modern experimental techniques [1]. The advantage of experiments performed in Ref. [1] is the design of the form of the flat capacitor with proper modulation of temperature, which is particularly suitable for studying properties of 2D materials. The differential entropy is calculated through the Maxwell relation s = (\u2202S/\u2202n)T = \u2212(\u2202\u03bc/\u2202T )n using the experimental data for evaluation of the second derivative. Recently, another set of experiments measuring differential entropy attracted great attention due to the observation of the isospin Pomeranchuk effect in twisted bilayer graphene [2,3]. In this set of experiments the differential entropy was extracted from the transport data.\nThe differential entropy per particle was proven to be a useful tool to probe the peculiar features of the band structure [4] and to show the presence of Lifshitz transitions with changing Fermi level [5]. In Ref. [6] it was shown that for two-dimensional electronic gas with parabolic dispersion the entropy per electron, s, exhibits quantized peaks which correspond to resonance positions of chemical potential at size quantization levels. The universal structure of these peaks was linked [6] to the topological Lifshitz transitions [7]. Later is was shown [4] that the entropy spikes in Dirac materials also correspond to the Lifshitz transitions, which occur at the boundaries of gapped bands.\nThe above-mentioned peaks and spikes of differential entropy [4\u20136] are the clear signatures of regions with vanishing density of states in the band structure. The goal of the present paper is to analyze the character of the differential entropy per particle in the opposite case, near the regions in band structure with diverging density of states (DoS). The classic examples\nof such divergence of DoS are the van Hove singularities (vHs) [8] with logarithmic divergence and flat bands [9,10] with delta-function-like divergence [11]. Recently, a new class of DoS singularities was introduced, high-order van Hove singularities [12], which corresponds to power-law divergence of DoS. The corresponding band structure contains the so-called high-order saddle point at the energy level of this vHs [13,14]. While the usual saddle points occur in most two-dimensional materials due to periodicity of the Brillouin zone (BZ) [8], the high-order saddle points became a common feature of novel two-dimensional materials [12]. Several examples of such materials that host high-order vHs of different kinds are \u03b2-YbAlB4 [15], bilayer graphene with tuned dispersion via adding interlayer voltage bias [16], and Sr3Ru2O7 [17]. Recently it was also shown that the tight-binding model of monolayer graphene can host high-order vHs if the next- and next-next-nearest-neighbor parameters are included and tuned to special critical values [18]. Notably, the novel experiment has shown that the energy level of the usual van Hove singularity in monolayer graphene can be accessed using the special technique of very high doping [19].\nThe appearance of van Hove singularities near the Fermi level can lead to different prominent phenomena. One expected phenomenon is the chiral superconductivity in monolayer graphene, that is predicted to occur at the level of vHs [20]. When a high-order vHs is placed close to the Fermi level, one can expect the enhancement of density wave and Pomeranchuk orders together with the superconductivity [18]. The role of high-order vHs on different pairing types in twisted bilayer graphene was analyzed in Ref. [21]. For example, their presence in twisted bilayer graphene [22] can lead to valley magnetism [23], density waves, and unconventional superconductivity [24] such as topological superconductivity [25], the \u201chigh-Tc\u201d phase diagram [26], and Kohn-Luttinger superconductivity [27].\nIn the recent papers [13] and [14] the classification of possible high-order van Hove singularities in 2D lattices with\n2469-9950/2022/106(4)/045115(13) 045115-1 \u00a92022 American Physical Society\ndifferent symmetry groups was performed. These results motivate us to analyze the differential entropy as an experimentally accessible quantity that can distinguish between different types of van Hove singularities. In the main text we derive the exact analytic expressions for the entropy per particle near the usual logarithmic and high-order van Hove singularities, and completely flat bands using the effective models for density of states [12\u201314]. Our expressions cover the whole range of known high-order van Hove singularities in 2D materials from Refs. [13,14] and have universal character as function of chemical potential divided by temperature. In addition, we compare the analytic expressions with numerical calculations for several tight-binding models (modified graphene [18] and Lieb lattice [10]) that host different types of high-order saddle points in dispersion. Then, we extend the analysis to the tight-binding model of the square-octagon lattice, where the dispersion has qualitative changes of type from saddle points to completely flat bands with changing model parameters [28\u201330]. The results for logarithmic van Hove singularities presented in the main text support the qualitative conclusions of Ref. [5] that the differential entropy has characteristic dip and peak structure, and passes through zero at the saddle point level. Notably, we find that the differential entropy near the high-order vHs level has even more pronounced features such as a dip or peak, and its behavior is fully defined by vHs type and temperature.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II we present the main definitions and derive analytic expressions for differential entropy. Also we identify the distinguishing features of the entropy per particle that characterize vHs. Next in Sec. III we present the comparison of analytic expressions with numerical calculations of the differential entropy for DoS found from tight-binding models. Finally, in Sec. IV we discuss the obtained results and their qualitative consequences that can be observed in experiments. The technical details of the analytic derivations are discussed in Appendices A and B."

            "text": "The differential entropy per electron in a given system can be evaluated using the Maxwell relation\ns \u2261 ( \u2202S\n\u2202n ) T = \u2212 ( \u2202\u03bc \u2202T ) n = ( \u2202n \u2202T ) \u03bc ( \u2202n \u2202\u03bc )\u22121 T , (1)\nwhere the derivative of the chemical potential is expressed through derivatives of the electron concentration n(\u03bc, T ). The quantity n(\u03bc, T ) itself can be expressed through the density of states in the system:\nn(\u03bc, T ) = \u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nD(\u03b5) exp (\n\u03b5\u2212\u03bc T ) + 1d\u03b5. (2) Here we set the Boltzmann constant to kB = 1 and measure the temperature in energy units. For the general 2D tightbinding model the density of states is defined as\nD(\u03b5) = \u2211\n\u03bb\n\u222b d2k\n(2\u03c0 )2 \u03b4[\u03b5 \u2212 E\u03bb(k)], (3)\nwhere the summation accounts for the band index \u03bb and possible spin degrees of freedom. Substituting these quantities back to Eq. (1) one finds the well-known expression for the differential entropy,\ns(\u03bc, T ) = 1 T\n\u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e d\u03b5D(\u03b5)(\u03b5 \u2212 \u03bc) cosh\u22122 ( \u03b5\u2212\u03bc 2T ) \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e d\u03b5D(\u03b5) cosh \u22122 ( \u03b5\u2212\u03bc 2T\n) . (4) This expression is used below in Sec. III for numerical calculations.\nNow let us concentrate on the specific expressions for DoS, where the energy \u03b5 is measured from the level of saddle point:\nDlog(\u03b5) = C1 ln \u03b50|\u03b5| , (5)\nD\u03b1 (\u03b5) = C2 [ D+ (\u03b5) (\u03b50\n\u03b5\n)\u03b1 + D\u2212 (\u2212\u03b5) ( \u03b50 |\u03b5| )\u03b1] , (6)\nDflat(\u03b5) = C3 \u03b4(\u03b5 \u2212 \u03b50). (7) Here the first expression with logarithmic behavior corresponds to ordinary van Hove singularity and the second expression with power-law divergence works in the vicinity of high-order vHs [12\u201314]. The power-law exponent has a natural upper limit \u03b1 < 1, which comes from the requirement that the total concentration of particles in the system is finite. (\u03b5) denotes the Heaviside step function and is used to describe the behavior on different sides of the saddle point. The numerical factors D\u00b1 define whether the DoS is symmetric or asymmetric around the singularity [14], and the constants C1, C2, and \u03b50 are used to properly normalize the expressions and take into account material-dependent parameters. Finally, Eq. (7) describes the DoS of a perfectly flat band placed at energy level \u03b50, and is typical effective approximation of DoS for many tight-binding models such as for Lieb [10] and dice lattices [31].\nTo evaluate the differential entropy analytically we start with the expression for particle concentration, Eq. (2), and substitute expressions for DoS (5), (6), and (7). Performing the calculation described in Appendix A, we find the closedform expression in terms of polylogarithm Lia(x) and gamma (x) functions [32] for n\u03b1 (\u03bc, T ). From particle concentration n\u03b1 (\u03bc, T ) given by Eq. (A6) we find the following expression for the differential entropy:\ns\u03b1 (\u03bc, T ) = (\u03b1 \u2212 1) D\u2212Li1\u2212\u03b1 (\u2212z) \u2212 D+Li1\u2212\u03b1 (\u2212 1z ) D\u2212Li\u2212\u03b1 (\u2212z) + D+Li\u2212\u03b1 (\u2212 1z ) \u2212 \u03bc T ,\nz = exp ( \u2212\u03bc\nT\n) . (8)\nFrom this expression it is evident that differential entropy for power-law divergent DoS depends only on the dimensionless combination \u03bc/T . Thus, the function s\u03b1 (\u03bc, T ) is universal for different classes of materials, some of which are listed in classifications from Refs. [13,14]. Notably, Eq. (8) can be also used for the differential entropy near the Dirac cone spectrum. Setting \u03b1 = \u22121, D+ = D\u2212 and using the identity Li1(z) = \u2212 ln(1 \u2212 z), we find the following expression, which agrees with results of Ref. [4]:\nsDirac(\u03bc, T ) = Li2(\u2212z) \u2212 Li2 (\u2212 1z ) ln [ 2 cosh ( \u03bc\n2T\n)] \u2212 \u03bc T . (9)\n045115-2\nThe differential entropy function s\u03b1 (\u03bc, T ) is plotted in Fig. 1 for several values of \u03b1 and corresponding examples of D+ and D\u2212 ratios, and compared with sDirac(\u03bc, T ). The qualitative difference between two cases is the different sign of the slope of the curves as functions of \u03bc/T when s(\u03bc, T ) passes through zero. Thus one can distinguish van Hove singularities from Dirac cones in the characteristic dip and peak structure of the differential entropy using the sign of the curve slope.\nFor the logarithmic van Hove singularity we find the following expression for differential entropy (see Appendix A):\nslog(\u03bc, T ) = \u2212 { \u03bc\nT\n[ Li(1,0)0 (\u2212z) + Li(1,0)0 ( \u22121\nz\n) + 1 ]\n+ Li(1,0)1 (\u2212z) \u2212 Li(1,0)1 (\n\u22121 z\n)}\n\u00d7 [ Li(1,0)0 (\u2212z) + Li(1,0)0 (\n\u22121 z\n)\n\u2212 ln ( \u03b50\nT\n) + \u03b3 ]\u22121 . (10)\nHere \u03b3 \u2248 0.5772 is the Euler constant, and the upper indexes in the polylogarithm functions correspond to the order of derivative with respect to the argument Li(n,m)a (x) \u2261 \u2202na \u2202 m x Lia(x). In this case the dependence of slog(\u03bc, T ) on \u03bc and T does not reduce to the single dimensionless variable \u03bc/T [as it did for power-law-diverging DoS; Eq. (8)], since\nthe logarithms in the denominator bracket contain also \u03b50/T . In the tight-binding models the parameter \u03b50 usually appears as a combination of spectrum decomposition coefficient a, b in dispersion \u03b5 \u2248 constant \u2212 ak2x + bk2y , and the momentum cutoff parameter that defines the applicability range of the model [12]. Thus, the obtained formula for slog(\u03bc, T ) has less universal character, as one should always take into account the material-specific constant. Assuming that \u03b50 is of the same order as tight-binding parameters \u03b50 \u223c 1 eV, and characteristic temperatures in experiment are usually from <1 up to 100 K, one can estimate the ratio \u03b50/T \u2248 102\u2013104. We plot slog(\u03bc, T ) in panel (b) of Fig. 1 to compare it with flat-band sflat and power-law s\u03b1 differential entropy expressions.\nFinally, in the case of the fully flat band as the limiting case of saddle points in dispersion the DoS is given by Eq. (7), where \u03b50 is the flat-band level. The expression for the entropy per particle in the vicinity of \u03bc = \u03b50 takes a very simple form due to integration with the delta function in Eq. (4),\nsflat band(\u03bc, T ) = \u03b50 \u2212 \u03bc T , (11)\nand shows that the entropy decreases linearly with chemical potential passing through zero at \u03bc = \u03b50. To compare the flat-band case with previously derived formulas for differential entropy, we expand Eqs. (8) and (10) into series around \u03bc/T = 0 up to first order. For the power-law vHs the expansion is the following:\ns\u03b1 (\u03bc, T ) \u2248 \u2212 (2 \u03b1 \u2212 1)(\u03b1 \u2212 1)(D \u2212 1)\u03b6 (1 \u2212 \u03b1)\n(2\u03b1+1 \u2212 1)(D + 1)\u03b6 (\u2212\u03b1) \u2212 \u03b1 \u03bc T + (\u03b1 \u2212 1) (2 \u03b1 \u2212 1)(2\u03b1+2 \u2212 1)(D \u2212 1)2\u03b6 (\u2212\u03b1 \u2212 1)\u03b6 (1 \u2212 \u03b1) (2\u03b1+1 \u2212 1)2(D + 1)2\u03b6 (\u2212\u03b1)2 \u03bc T . (12)\nHere we denote the ratio of numerical coefficients D\u00b1 as D = D+/D\u2212 and \u03b6 (x) denotes the Riemann zeta function. Note that the constant term vanishes for symmetric saddle\npoint dispersion, while the linear term reduces to \u2212\u03b1 \u03bcT . Thus, the slope of the entropy curve plotted as a function of chemical potential immediately gives the divergence exponent and van\n045115-3\nHove singularity type. Also, the physical upper limit for \u03b1 is \u03b1 < 1 and the \u03b1 = 1 corresponds to exactly flat band (11).

To analyze different van Hove singularities we first use the toy model from Ref. [18] of monolayer graphene with tunable next-nearest-neighbor and next-next-nearest-neighbor hopping parameters. In this model one can switch between the usual and high-order van Hove singularities by adjusting these parameters to specific values. Using this example, we study asymmetric high-order vHs with the divergence exponent of DoS \u03b1 = 1/4. Next we take the pseudospin-1 tight-binding model which hosts ideal flat bands, the Lieb lattice. In this model one can analyze to which extent the flat band solely determines the differential entropy behavior as the strongly dominating feature in the density of states. Finally, we analyze the tight-binding model of the square-octagon lattice, in which\nthe most asymmetric type of high-order vHs is realized with one of D\u00b1 coefficients equal to zero and \u03b1 = 1/2.

These vectors are shown in Fig. 2(a) as solid lines and solid and dashed arrows, respectively. The hopping parameters ti correspond to the ith-nearest-neighbor contributions. The highly symmetric points of this model are K points in the corners of the hexagonal Brillouin zone, which are given by\nK1 = 2\u03c0/3(1/ \u221a 3, 1), K2 = 2\u03c0/3(\u22121/ \u221a 3, 1), (19)\nwhere one finds the usual Dirac cones, and M points in the middles of the BZ edges:\nM1 = \u03c0 (0, 2/3), M2 = \u03c0 (\u22121/ \u221a 3, 1/3), M3 = \u2212 \u03c0 (1/ \u221a 3, 1/3), (20)\nwhere the saddle points corresponding to van Hove singularities are placed. Diagonalizing the Hamiltonian, one finds the two bands, that are described by the following dispersion relation:\n\u03b5\u00b1(k) = \u00b1|t1\u03b1(k) + t3\u03b3 (k)| \u2212 t2\u03b2(k). (21) The main feature of this model is that at special values of the 3rd-NN parameters\nt3 \u2192 t3,c = (t1 \u2212 2t2)/4 (22) one meets the high-order van Hove singularity instead of classical one [18]. The bands \u03b5\u00b1(k) are plotted in Fig. 2 specifically for these relations of parameters (t2 = 0.2t1, t3 = 0.15t2). The corresponding density of states near the saddle point in the upper band is approximately given by\nD(\u03b5) \u2248 \u03c1 {\nD+\u03b5\u22121/4, for \u03b5 > 0, D\u2212|\u03b5|\u22121/4, for \u03b5 < 0, (23)\nwith D\u2212 = D+/ \u221a\n2 and \u03c1 is the proper dimensional parameter. The high-order vHs appears only in upper band, while in the lower band it is always the usual logarithmic vHs. We calculate its exact positions from \u03b5\u00b1(k), taking the M1 point:\n\u03b5+(k = M1) = |t1 \u2212 3t3| + 2t2, \u03b5\u2212(k = M1) = \u2212|t1 \u2212 3t3| + 2t2. (24)\nIn the upper plot in Fig. 2(c) we plot the density of states for the tight-binding model (14). The delta-functions in the density of states integrals (3) were regularized by introducing the finite energy level width in the form of Lorentzian shape with parameter :\n\u03b4(\u03b5 \u2212 E\u03bb) \u2192 1 \u03c0 2 + (\u03b5 \u2212 E\u03bb)2 . (25)\nThe \u201cwidth\u201d is taken to be much smaller than the characteristic energy scale defined by the hopping parameter t and smaller than T to avoid important features from being hidden. Such level broadening can occur due to the presence of disorder, boundaries, defects, and electron-electron, electron-phonon interactions in real systems. The experiments suggest that can be of the order of 10 meV [33,34]. Recently the more detailed theoretical discussion of the role of disorder on DoS smearing was given in Ref. [35] using Born approximations. Here for the numerical calculations we took either = 0.005t1 or = 0.01t1 to check that results\ndo not strongly depend on choice as long as < T (room temperature is around T \u223c 20 meV in energy units). The integrals are evaluated numerically using an equally spaced grid with small enough discretization steps in kx, ky, and \u03b5. To evaluate DoS, we calculate the spectrum in each point (kx, ky ) of discretization inside the first BZ and perform summation over bands using smeared delta functions (25). The energy integrals for the differential entropy [see Eq. (4)] are bounded on both sides with a cutoff parameter that is larger than the total bandwidth of the tight-binding model. This ensures that the contributions of all bands are included in the final result.\nIn the lower plot in Fig. 2(c) we plot the numerically calculated differential entropy as a function of chemical potential for T = 0.01t1. The interval of both upper and lower parts is selected such that it covers all characteristic features from the spectrum in panel (b). The analytic curve for s\u03b1 (\u03bc, T ) from Eq. (8) is plotted around the chemical potential level \u03b5+(k = M1) with \u03b1 = 1/4 and D+/D\u2212 = \u221a 2 as the red dashed line. It demonstrates good agreement with numerically calculated entropy per particle in the vicinity of the vHs level and predicts the slope of the curve that passes through zero. Away from that level it also describes the peak and reduction of differential entropy, but the precision is not so accurate. As was noted in Refs. [4,5], one should expect the manifestation of main features in entropy in the \u2212T, T interval around the corresponding energy level. In our case the theoretical curve is plotted in the range \u221210T, 10T , and still remains mostly valid. On the smaller chemical potential the analytic formula predicts a less pronounced peak than the one that actually appears. The possible reason of such underestimation is the fact that the closely placed Dirac points [see panel (b)] induce the entropy spikes [4], and these spikes are partially merged with that coming from vHs. Notably, Eq. (9) that describes differential entropy per particle near the Dirac cone works well predicting the slope and its sign, but instead overestimates the height of the dip and peak structure. The latter may be caused by level broadening as DoS does not drop to zero at the Dirac cone if = 0 [4].\nFinally, we analyze how the formula for differential entropy (10) works around the logarithmic vHs. Panel (b) in Fig. 1 suggests that the expected behavior is similar to the one observed in the vicinity of the usual vHs level in Fig. 2(c). There is some arbitrariness in choosing the \u03b50 parameter as it usually contains a momentum cutoff [12]. It is relatively hard to take it from tight-binding calculation of DoS, since there are other contributions and it is difficult to compare logarithms. However, this can be found by comparing the slope of the differential entropy curve with the theoretic prediction. In panel (c) we plot the analytic curve given by Eq. (10) with \u03b50 = 5t1 as the green dashed line. One should note that the parameter \u03b50 does not have strict physical limits as it comes as the normalization under the logarithm, and appears as a combination of constants in band decomposition and cutoff parameters over momenta in the effective model. We checked numerically that \u03b50 is of the order of 10t1 (thus, \u03b50 > 100T ). In Appendix B we perform estimation of \u03b50 using a more precise series expansion of dispersion around the M1 point, and find \u03b50 \u2248 13t1. This is in good agreement with numerical calculation. Also this result together with Fig. 1 shows that the slope of the slog function is always smaller that for s\u03b1 at the\n045115-5\nvHs chemical potential. However, we should again underline that the formula (10) has much less predictive power due to its nonuniversal character with the \u03b50 parameter inside. Below we analyze other systems to test the applicability of Eqs. (8) and (11) in different cases."

(27)\nThis model was experimentally realized in optical [36] and electronic lattices [37].\nIn the analysis of the Lieb lattice we concentrate on the differential entropy near the flat-band level. In the gapless case the two Dirac cones touch the flat band in the triply degenerate point k = (\u03c0/a, \u03c0/a). Thus, one would expect the appearance of spikes in differential entropy near level \u03bc = 0. Also, the analytic expression (11) predicts that s(\u03bc, T ) should pass through zero at \u03bc = 0 and the slope is defined only by inverse temperature 1/T .\nPanels (a) and (b) in Fig. 4 show the numerically calculated density of states in the upper plots [the level broadening\n= 0.005t is taken to regularize delta functions; see Eq. (25)] and entropy per particle in the lower plots for the same range of chemical potentials. The difference between the two panels in the presence of the gap in panel (b) = 0.3t and in the temperatures (a) T = 0.01t , (b) T = 0.05t . We compare the analytic expression for the entropy near the flat band (red dashed curves) with the numerically calculated one. Both panels show good agreement between analytic predictions and numerical results. Note that despite the presence of Dirac cones that touch the flat band from both sides in the gapless case = 0 [10], the flat band solely determines the entropy behavior in the surrounding interval of chemical potentials due to the diverging density of states. Thus, the obtained results should also work for other flat-band systems such as the dice lattice, where the low-energy density of states has contributions from the flat band and Dirac cones [31,38], and the flat band is expected to be stable with respect to different perturbations [39\u201341]."

            "heading": "C. Transition from high-order vHs to flat band: Square-octagon lattice model",
            "text": "Next we analyze the tight-binding model which is based on the square-octagon lattice [28,29]. This lattice attracted attention due to the possibility of existence of the stable graphene allotrope called T-graphene [42\u201344], stable MX2 (M = Mo, W; X = S, Se, Te) isomers [45], and Zn2O2, Zn4O4 monolayers [46]. It is schematically shown in panel (a) of Fig. 5. As was shown in the literature, besides the usual van Hove singularities the tight-binding model of the square-octagon lattice always hosts high-order van Hove singularities [30] and, in the special case of fine-tuned next-nearest-neighbor parameters, two exactly flat bands [47]. The Hamiltonian that describes the square-octagon lattice with nearest-neighbor (NN) t1,2 hopping parameters (between and inside small squares) and nextnearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping parameters \u03c4 (diagonals\n045115-6\ninside small squares) has the form\nHT g(k) = \u2212 \u239b \u239c\u239c\u239d\n0 t2 t1eikxa + \u03c4 t2 t2 0 t2 t1eikya + \u03c4\nt1e\u2212ikxa + \u03c4 t2 0 t2 t2 t1e\u2212ikya + \u03c4 t2 0\n\u239e \u239f\u239f\u23a0. (28)\nThe spectrum defined by this Hamiltonian contains four bands. For arbitrary values of hopping parameters the exact expressions for energy bands are defined by fourth-order equations [28\u201330] and are very complicated. However, the expansions of the spectrum near saddle points are relatively easy to obtain. In Fig. 5 we plot several examples of the spectrum for \u03c4 = 0 with two different ratios of t2/t1: t2/t1 = 3/2 in panel (b) and t2/t1 = 1 in panel (c), and for \u03c4 = \u2212t1 with t2/t1 = 1 in panel (d), where the two flat bands appear. As was noted in Ref. [30], the high-order van Hove singularities appear on the levels of flat lines \u03b5 = \u00b1t1 for all values of t2/t1 if \u03c4 = 0. The position of flat lines can be shifted by nonzero \u03c4 hopping parameter, and for several critical values of \u03c4 the two bands become completely flat [47].\nThe characteristic singularity in DoS for high-order vHs, that comes from flat lines in the spectrum, is the same for all values of t2/t1 (we first analyze the case of \u03c4 = 0), and is given by\nD(\u03b5 \u2248 t1) = D0 {|\u03b5 \u2212 t1|\u22121/2, \u03b5 < t1,\n0, \u03b5 > t1, D(\u03b5 \u2248 \u2212t1) = D0 {|\u03b5 + t1|\u22121/2, \u03b5 > \u2212t1, 0, \u03b5 < \u2212t1. (29)\nThis represent the limiting case of the vHs asymmetry, since one of the coefficients D+ and D\u2212 is zero. Also, this model has one of the strongest divergencies compared to lattices classified in Ref. [14]. In panels (a) and (b) of Fig. 6 we plot the numerically calculated density of states and the corresponding differential entropy, together with analytic expressions (8) (shown as red dashed lines). The temperature was chosen as T = 0.05t1 and the level broadening was set to be = 0.01t1. We especially selected a larger temperature than that in Sec. III A to check the applicability of analytic expressions when vHs are more pronounced. Notably, the results in Fig. 6 show very good agreement between Eq. (8) and numerical results. As was discussed in Refs. [29,30], in the t2/t1 = 3/2 case the flat lines are separated from upper (lower) bands by a large gap, and in the case of t2/t1 = 1 there are three-band-\ntouching points with two Dirac cones exactly at the vHs level. Still, the analytic expression works very well because the integrals in numerator and denominator in the differential entropy definition (4) are strongly dominated by vHs contributions. The plot range of analytic expression covers more than the [\u22124T,+4T ] interval around vHs. Also, one should note that zeros of the differential entropy appear near DoS extrema, as was qualitatively discussed in Ref. [5].\nAlso, the model contains logarithmic van Hove singularities that are related to the usual saddle points in the band spectrum. They are always placed near the M points (middle points on the sides of BZ), and for the \u03c4 = 0 case their energies are given by \u2213t1 \u221a 1 + 4(t2/t1)2. In this case we plot the linearized expression of slog, which allows one to identify the characteristic parameter \u03b50. In panels (a) and (b) we shown\n045115-7\nthe comparison of linear curves with the properly selected \u03b50 parameter versus numerical results for the differential entropy. We find a relatively large value of parameter \u03b50 = 9t1. However, here the slog(\u03bc, T ) does not fully describe the differential entropy because the curve does not pass through zero exactly at the vHs point. One can relate this to the presence of an additional large constant density of states that surrounds vHs as is done at the end of Appendix A. In fact, taking into account the additional constant density of states, one finds the numerically observed shift of the differential entropy curve from zero for logarithmic vHs, but not for symmetric high-order vHs. In this sense the symmetric high-order vHs and flat bands as a limiting case demonstrate more stable qualitative features in s(\u03bc, T ) than other types of DoS singularities.\nFinally, we analyze the regime of the so-called \u201ccritical\u201d value of the next-nearest-neighbor hopping parameter \u03c4 = \u2212t1 (with t1 = t2), for which the two flat bands in the spectrum appear [47]. Such spectrum is shown in panel (d) of Fig. 5, and the corresponding DoS / differential entropy comparison is presented in Fig. 6(c). The exact energies of flat bands are \u03b5flat = 0, 2t1. We plot the analytic expressions from Eq. (11) for both cases and find very good agreement with numerical results. Also we should note that the peaks in s(\u03bc, T ), that surround the flat-band zero, are the most pronounced features of the differential entropy in such regime. This is related to the fact that flat bands are placed near the spectral gap and band edge, respectively.\n045115-8"

            "text": "In the present paper we derived the analytic expressions for the differential entropy per particle near the usual logarithmic and high-order (power law) van Hove singularities as well as flat bands. The important characteristic of the obtained results for high-order vHs and flat bands is the universality of the differential entropy expressions: they do not contain materialspecific constants apart from those characterizing the vHs type and the position of the flat band. The obtained expression for the differential entropy near the usual logarithmic vHs is not universal and contains a parameter that should be estimated from the effective theory which describes the saddle point in particular material or from numerical data.\nFor the case of high-order van Hove singularities the slope of the entropy curve and its shift from zero allow one to identify the type of vHs. In fact, one may expect that this approach of identifying vHs type can be more precise than measurement of DoS in the case of symmetric van Hove singularities. The reason is that the slope of the entropy curve as a function of \u03bc/T immediately gives the divergence exponent. In addition, the obtained expressions show that the entropy near the flat band has the largest slope compared to all physically possible high-order van Hove singularities. The slope for logarithmic singularities is expected to be even smaller.\nIn Refs. [4,5] it was noted that zeros of the entropy per particle correspond to the extrema of the DoS curve as a function of \u03bc. In addition, the logarithmic van Hove singularities manifest themselves as strong positive peaks and negative dip structures. Our results fully support these conclusions and generalize them to the case of high-order van Hove singularities. In fact, for the symmetric high-order vHs and flat band the structure of the differential entropy is qualitatively the same, but the peaks and dips have much larger amplitude than that around the logarithmic vHs level. For asymmetric\nhigh-order vHs the pronounced peak or dip may be absent depending on asymmetry type.\nWe performed numerical calculations of DoS and the differential entropy for several tight-binding models: graphene with fine-tuned next- and next-next-nearest neighbor hopping parameters, the Lieb lattice, and the square-octagon lattice. Our analytic predictions show good agreement with numerical results. However, one important limitation of the obtained formulas is that the corresponding spectral feature in DoS should be well separated in energy from other possible features\u2014 other van Hove singularities, flat bands, or large constant DoS. The region where the analytic formulas are expected to work well is \u00b1T from vHs or flat-band energy level. In the case when other spectral features are presented nearby, one should derive combined expressions, taking into account the corresponding DoS of all of them. However, such results quickly become very complicated and go beyond the scope of our paper. One of the interesting physical questions that have to be addressed elsewhere is how the merging of several van Hove singularities with changing model parameters is manifested in the differential entropy."

After the extraction of the singular part, the integrals become (we omit the tilde in the integration variable for simplicity)\nQ(\u03bc, \u03b1) = D+ 1 z \u222b \u221e 0 1 \u03b5\u03b1\n1 exp (\u03b5) + (1/z)d\u03b5 + D\u2212 \u222b \u221e\n0\n1\n\u03b5\u03b1\nexp (\u03b5)\nz + exp (\u03b5)d\u03b5\n045115-9\n= D+ z \u222b \u221e 0 1 \u03b5\u03b1\n1 exp (\u03b5) + (1/z)d\u03b5 + D\u2212 \u222b\n0\n1\n\u03b5\u03b1 d\u03b5 \u2212 zD\u2212 \u222b \u221e 0 1 \u03b5\u03b1\n1\nz + exp (\u03b5)d\u03b5\n= \u2212D+Li1\u2212\u03b1 (\n\u22121 z\n) (1 \u2212 \u03b1) + D\u2212 1\u2212\u03b1\n1 \u2212 \u03b1 + D\u2212Li1\u2212\u03b1 (\u2212z) (1 \u2212 \u03b1). (A3)\nIn the last line we used the Appell integral for the polylogarithm function [32],\nLis(z) = z (s) \u222b \u221e 0 t s\u22121 dt et \u2212 z , Re s > 0. (A4)\nThe condition for real part Re s > 0 is satisfied by the physical limit 0 < \u03b1 < 1. Substituting Eq. (A3) back into the expression for concentration of electrons, we find\nn\u03b1 (\u03bc, T ) = C2T 1\u2212\u03b1\u03b5\u03b10 (1 \u2212 \u03b1) [ D\u2212Li1\u2212\u03b1 (\u2212z) \u2212 D+Li1\u2212\u03b1 (\n\u22121 z\n)] + C2\u03b5\u03b10 D\u2212E1\u2212\u03b10 1 \u2212 \u03b1 , (A5)\nwhere we specially separated the regularization constant out in brackets. This constant is independent of \u03bc and T and only depends on the parameters of the particular system and \u03b1. Thus, we rewrite this equation in a more formal way as\nn\u03b1 (\u03bc, T ) = n0(\u03b1) + C2T 1\u2212\u03b1\u03b5\u03b10 (1 \u2212 \u03b1) [ D\u2212Li1\u2212\u03b1 (\u2212z) \u2212 D+Li1\u2212\u03b1 (\n\u22121 z\n)] . (A6)\nHere we introduced n0 as a material-specific regularizing constant, which accounts for the filled levels deep under the Fermi level, and does not depend on \u03bc and T . This constant is automatically canceled in derivatives presented in Eq. (1), so it can be safely ignored here.\nNow the entropy per particle is calculated through the derivatives of concentration via Eq. (1). The constant n0 = C2\u03b5\u03b10 D\u2212E 1\u2212\u03b1 0\n1\u2212\u03b1 is automatically canceled by derivatives. By noting that the dependence on \u03bc enters n\u03b1 (\u03bc, T ) only through variable z = exp(\u2212\u03bc/T ), we simplify the expression for entropy as follows:\ns = (\n\u2202n\u03b1 \u2202T ) \u03bc ( \u2202n\u03b1 \u2202\u03bc )\u22121 T = [ (1 \u2212 \u03b1)n\u03b1 (\u03bc, T ) \u2212 n0 T + T 1\u2212\u03b1\u2202z ( n\u03b1 (\u03bc, T ) \u2212 n0 T 1\u2212\u03b1 ) \u2202T z ][ T 1\u2212\u03b1\u2202z ( n\u03b1 (\u03bc, T ) \u2212 n0 T 1\u2212\u03b1 ) \u2202\u03bcz ]\u22121\n= (1 \u2212 \u03b1) n\u03b1 (\u03bc,T )\u2212n0 T\nT 1\u2212\u03b1\u2202z ( n\u03b1 (\u03bc,T )\u2212n0 T 1\u2212\u03b1 ) \u2202\u03bcz + \u2202T z \u2202\u03bcz . (A7)\nThe last ratio of the derivatives in this expression gives the contribution \u2212\u03bc/T to the differential entropy. The derivative over z has the form\n\u2202z\n( n\u03b1 (\u03bc, T ) \u2212 n0\nT 1\u2212\u03b1\n) = C2\u03b5\u03b10 (1 \u2212 \u03b1)\u2202z [ D\u2212Li1\u2212\u03b1 (\u2212z) \u2212 D+Li1\u2212\u03b1 ( \u22121\nz\n)]\n= C2\u03b5\u03b10 (1 \u2212 \u03b1)\nz\n[ D\u2212Li\u2212\u03b1 (\u2212z) + D+Li\u2212\u03b1 ( \u22121\nz\n)] . (A8)\nSubstituting this back into the expression for entropy and canceling the equal factors, we find\ns = \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b1)T 1\u2212\u03b1 (1 \u2212 \u03b1)[D\u2212Li1\u2212\u03b1 (\u2212z) \u2212 D+Li1\u2212\u03b1(\u2212 1z )]\nT 2\u2212\u03b1 (1\u2212\u03b1)z [ D\u2212Li\u2212\u03b1 (\u2212z) + D+Li\u2212\u03b1 (\u2212 1z )] zT \u2212 \u03bc T\n= \u2212(1 \u2212 \u03b1)D\u2212Li1\u2212\u03b1 (\u2212z) \u2212 D+Li1\u2212\u03b1 (\u2212 1z )\nD\u2212Li\u2212\u03b1 (\u2212z) + D+Li\u2212\u03b1 (\u2212 1z ) \u2212 \u03bc T . (A9)\nThis expression appears in the main text; see Eq. (8). Next we perform the calculation of entropy for the logarithmic density of states (5), that describes the ordinary van Hove singularity. Again we start with the particle concentration and note the useful relation with Eq. (A1) for n\u03b1 (\u03bc, T ):\nnlog(\u03bc, T ) = \u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e\nDlog(\u03b5)d\u03b5 exp (\n\u03b5\u2212\u03bc T\n) + 1 = C1 \u2202 \u2202\u03b1\n[ n\u03b1 (\u03bc, T, D+ = D\u2212)\nC2\n] \u03b1\u21920 . (A10)\nHere we used the algebraic relation \u2202\u03b1 (\u03b50/|\u03b5|)\u03b1|\u03b1\u21920 = ln(\u03b50/|\u03b5|). Using this relation and taking into account that n\u03b1 (\u03bc, T ) under the derivative should be properly regularized [see Eq. (A5)], we can express the differential entropy as follows:\nslog(\u03bc, T ) = [ \u2202\n\u2202\u03b1 ( \u2202n\u03b1 \u2202T ) \u03bc ] \u03b1\u21920 [ \u2202 \u2202\u03b1 ( \u2202n \u2202\u03bc ) T ]\u22121 \u03b1\u21920 . (A11)\n045115-10\nIn this equation we changed the order of derivatives, which would allow us to cancel material-dependent regularization constants. Also it reduced the problem to evaluating the derivatives of the previously obtained result for particle concentration in the case of a high-order saddle point (A5). Evaluating the derivatives, we find(\n\u2202n\n\u2202T ) \u03bc = \u2212 C1 { \u03bc T [Li(1,0)(0,\u2212e\u2212 \u03bcT ) + Li(1,0)(0,\u2212e \u03bcT )] + Li(1,0)(1,\u2212e\u2212 \u03bcT ) \u2212 Li(1,0)(1,\u2212e \u03bcT )\n+ [ ln (\u03b50\nT\n) + \u03b3 \u2212 1 ] [ln(e\u2212 \u03bc\nT + 1) \u2212 ln(e \u03bcT + 1)] + \u03bc T\n[ ln ( \u03b50\nT\n) + \u03b3 ]} , (A12)\n( \u2202n\n\u2202\u03bc ) T = C1 [ Li(1,0)(0,\u2212e\u2212 \u03bcT ) + Li(1,0)(0,\u2212e \u03bcT ) + \u03b3 \u2212 ln ( \u03b50 T )] . (A13)\nHere \u03b3 \u2248 0.5772 is the Euler constant. Combining these two expressions, we arrive at Eq. (10) in the main text. To explore the effects of other DoS features near the vHs level we perform the calculation for density of states which includes the constant term D0 in addition to vHs contributions from Eqs. (5) and (6). By noting that the constant DoS corresponds to the limit \u03b1 \u2192 0 with D+ = D\u2212 = D0 of Eq. (6), we can use the previous results of integration from this Appendix. For the high-order vHs case, taking D(\u03b5) = D\u03b1 (\u03b5) + C2D0 we find the concentration\nn\u03b1, const (\u03bc, T ) = n\u03b1 (\u03bc, T ) + n\u03b1\u21920(\u03bc, T, D\u00b1 \u2192 D0). (A14) Substituting this into Eq. (1), we find the modified expression differential entropy:\ns = ( \u2202n\u03b1, const \u2202T ) \u03bc( \u2202n\u03b1, const\n\u2202\u03bc ) T\n= (1 \u2212 \u03b1) n\u03b1 (\u03bc,T )\u2212n0\nT + T 1\u2212\u03b1\u2202z ( n\u03b1 (\u03bc,T )\u2212n0 T 1\u2212\u03b1 ) \u2202T z + n\u03b1\u21920(\u03bc,T )\u2212n0T + T \u2202z ( n\u03b1\u21920(\u03bc,T )\u2212n0 T 1 ) \u2202T z\nT 1\u2212\u03b1\u2202z ( n\u03b1 (\u03bc,T )\u2212n0 T 1\u2212\u03b1 ) \u2202\u03bcz + T \u2202z ( n\u03b1\u21920(\u03bc,T )\u2212n0 T ) \u2202\u03bcz\n. (A15)\nSubstituting the results of differentiation and simplifying the expressions as in Eq. (A7), we find\ns = \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b1)T 1\u2212\u03b1\u03b5\u03b10 (1 \u2212 \u03b1)\n[ D\u2212 Li1\u2212\u03b1 (\u2212z) \u2212 D+ Li1\u2212\u03b1 (\u2212 1z )] + T [D0 Li1(\u2212z) \u2212 D0 Li1 (\u2212 1z )] T 1\u2212\u03b1\u03b5\u03b10 (1 \u2212 \u03b1) [ D\u2212Li\u2212\u03b1 (\u2212z) + D+Li\u2212\u03b1 (\u2212 1z )] + T [D0Li0(\u2212z) + D0Li0(\u2212 1z )] \u2212 \u03bc T . (A16)\nThe main conclusion that can be drawn from this expression is that now behavior does not depend only on the \u03bc/T relation, but contains an additional temperature dependence in the first term. To perform further analysis, we reduce the complexity of expression by expanding it around \u03bc = 0 for the symmetric vHs case D+ = D\u2212:\ns \u2248 \u2212 \u03b1\u03bc T ( 1 + D0\u03b5\u2212\u03b10 T \u03b12\u03b1(2\u03b1+1\u22121)D+ (\u2212\u03b1)\u03b6 (\u2212\u03b1) ) . (A17) Notably, the differential entropy curve will still pass through zero at \u03bc = 0, but now the slope will be modified and depend on temperature as well as other material parameters such as D+, D0, and \u03b50. If one takes sufficiently low temperatures, such that \u03b50 T , the correction to the slope will be small.\nPerforming the same calculation for the logarithmic van Hove singularity, we find the following approximate expression at a small around vHs level \u03bc T [technical details of calculations are the same as in Eqs. (A12) and (A16)]:\ns = D0 (\n1 ln (\n2\u03b5 \u03c0T\n) + \u03b3 + T ) \u2212 D0 + 1 ln ( \u03b50 T ) + \u03b3 + ln ( 2 \u03c0 ) \u03bc T . (A18)\nNow the first \u03bc-independent term appears, which describes the shift of curve from zero at \u03bc, as was observed numerically in Sec. III C.\nAPPENDIX B: ESTIMATION OF \u03b50 PARAMETER FOR LOGARITHMIC VHS DOS IN GRAPHENE WITH NNN HOPPING PARAMETERS\nIn this Appendix we show how the parameter \u03b50 that enters DoS for logarithmic vHs (5) can be estimated from the series expansion coefficients of the dispersion relation near the saddle point. For this purpose we use the example of graphene with NNN hopping parameters analyzed in Sec. III A. In the lower band given by \u03b5\u2212(k) in Eq. (21) one finds the logarithmic van Hove singularity at M points with energy \u03b5\u2212(k = M1) = \u2212|t1 \u2212 3t3| + 2t2. Expanding the dispersion up to fourth order around the M1 point and taking tight-binding parameters used for calculations t2 = 0.2t1, t3 = 0.15t1, we find\n\u03b5\u2212(k = M1 + q) \u2248 \u2212 3 20 t1 + 3 55\na2t1 ( 11q2x \u2212 96q2y ) + a4t1 ( 5751q2x q 2 y\n3872 \u2212 21 320 q4x + 1463373q4y 85184\n) . (B1)\nBy noting that the fourth-order term is strongly dominated by the last fraction in brackets for nearly all q, we can use the results of Ref. [12] to estimate the \u03b50 parameter. For the dispersion of the form\n\u03b5 = \u03b5vHs + \u03b1a2q2x \u2212 \u03b2a2q2y + \u03baa4q24, (B2)\n045115-11\none finds the leading term in DoS D(\u03b5) \u223c ln \u03b50/|\u03b5 \u2212 \u03b5vHs| with \u03b50 = (8\u03b22/\u03ba )t1. Substituting our parameters we find \u03b50 \u2248 12.8t1, which is close to the one estimated numerically in Sec. III A.\n[1] A. Y. Kuntsevich, Y. V. Tupikov, V. M. Pudalov, and I. S.
