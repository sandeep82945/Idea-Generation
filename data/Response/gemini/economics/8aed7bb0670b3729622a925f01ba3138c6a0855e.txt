1. **Investigate the cost-effectiveness of surfactant administration in low-income countries.** The current SLR excluded studies conducted in low-income countries due to inadequate and resource-limited neonatal care. However, given the high burden of RDS in these countries, it is important to understand the cost-effectiveness of surfactant administration in these settings. This information could help policymakers make informed decisions about the allocation of resources for RDS treatment.


2. **Compare the cost-effectiveness of different surfactant administration methods.** The current SLR identified a few studies that compared the cost-effectiveness of different surfactants, but no studies that compared the cost-effectiveness of different surfactant administration methods. Given the increasing use of less invasive surfactant administration methods, such as IN-SUR-E, it is important to understand the cost-effectiveness of these methods compared to traditional endotracheal intubation.


3. **Evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of surfactant administration.** The current SLR focused on the short-term cost-effectiveness of surfactant administration. However, RDS can have long-term consequences, such as bronchopulmonary dysplasia and neurodevelopmental impairment. It is important to evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of surfactant administration to understand the full economic impact of this treatment.


4. **Develop a decision-analytic model to compare the cost-effectiveness of different RDS treatment strategies.** A decision-analytic model could be used to compare the cost-effectiveness of different RDS treatment strategies, such as early vs. late surfactant administration, different surfactant administration methods, and different combinations of surfactant and other therapies. This model could help policymakers make informed decisions about the most cost-effective RDS treatment strategy.


5. **Conduct a systematic review of the literature on the cost-effectiveness of surfactant administration in neonates with RDS.** A systematic review of the literature on the cost-effectiveness of surfactant administration in neonates with RDS would provide a comprehensive overview of the available evidence on this topic. This review could help identify gaps in the literature and inform future research.
