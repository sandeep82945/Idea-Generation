1. **Investigate the potential synergistic effects of TQ and other antioxidants.** TQ has been shown to have antioxidant properties, but it is possible that it may work even better in combination with other antioxidants. Future research could investigate the synergistic effects of TQ and other antioxidants, such as vitamin C, vitamin E, or resveratrol.


2. **Explore the use of TQ in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases.** TQ has been shown to have anti-inflammatory and anti-cancer properties, suggesting that it may be useful in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases such as heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease. Future research could investigate the efficacy of TQ in these diseases.


3. **Study the bioavailability and metabolism of TQ.** The bioavailability and metabolism of TQ are not well understood. Future research could investigate how TQ is absorbed, distributed, and metabolized in the body. This information could help to optimize the delivery of TQ and improve its therapeutic potential.


4. **Develop new TQ-based drugs and delivery systems.** TQ has a number of potential therapeutic applications, but its use is limited by its poor solubility and bioavailability. Future research could focus on developing new TQ-based drugs and delivery systems that can improve its solubility and bioavailability.


5. **Investigate the potential toxicity of TQ.** TQ is generally considered to be safe, but there is some evidence that it may be toxic at high doses. Future research could investigate the potential toxicity of TQ and identify any potential risks associated with its use.
