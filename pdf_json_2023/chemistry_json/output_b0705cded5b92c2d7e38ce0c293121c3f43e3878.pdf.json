    "abstractText": "During COVID\u201019 pandemic, Favipiravir (FPV) showed a great efficacy against COVID\u201019 virus, it produced noticeable improvements in recovery of the patients. The aim of this study was to develop a new, green and simple method for the simultaneous determination of FPV and its acid\u2010induced degradation product (ADP) in its pure and pharmaceutical dosage forms. This method will be key for the inevitable development of FPV solution and inhaler formulations. A green micellar RP\u2010HPLC method was developed using an RP\u2010VDSPHERE PUR 100 column (5 \u03bcm, 250 \u00d7 4.6 mm) and an isocratic mixed micellar mobile phase composed of 0.02 M Brij\u201035, 0.1 M SDS and 0.01 M potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate anhydrous and adjusted to pH 3.0 with 1.0 mL min\u22121 flow rate. The detection was performed at 280 nm with a run time of less than six min. Under the optimized chromatographic conditions, linear relationship has been established between peak area and concentration of FPV and its ADP in the range of 5\u2013100 and 10\u2013100 \u03bcg mL\u22121 with elution time of 3.8 and 5.7 min, respectively. The developed method was validated according to the ICH guidelines and applied successfully for determination of FPV in its pharmaceutical dosage form.",

Hassan 2,3\nDuring COVID\u201119 pandemic, Favipiravir (FPV) showed a great efficacy against COVID\u201119 virus, it produced noticeable improvements in recovery of the patients. The aim of this study was to develop a new, green and simple method for the simultaneous determination of FPV and its acid\u2011induced degradation product (ADP) in its pure and pharmaceutical dosage forms. This method will be key for the inevitable development of FPV solution and inhaler formulations. A green micellar RP\u2011HPLC method was developed using an RP\u2011VDSPHERE PUR 100 column (5 \u00b5m, 250 \u00d7 4.6 mm) and an isocratic mixed micellar mobile phase composed of 0.02 M Brij\u201135, 0.1 M SDS and 0.01 M potassium dihydrogen orthophosphate anhydrous and adjusted to pH 3.0 with 1.0 mL min\u22121 flow rate. The detection was performed at 280 nm with a run time of less than six min. Under the optimized chromatographic conditions, linear relationship has been established between peak area and concentration of FPV and its ADP in the range of 5\u2013100 and 10\u2013100 \u00b5g mL\u22121 with elution time of 3.8 and 5.7 min, respectively. The developed method was validated according to the ICH guidelines and applied successfully for determination of FPV in its pharmaceutical dosage form.\nIn December 2019, COVID-19 was discovered in China and caused a global pandemic. About six different strains of Coronavirus were being reported to affect humans, even though, the seventh one which was identified as SARS-CoV-2 was similar to the SARS coronavirus genetically1. As soon as this pandemic has appeared, scientists and drug developers in all companies tried to develop new drugs and vaccinations to control this crisis and save peoples\u2019 life. Novelty of virus\u2019s strain made the old treatments and vaccinations ineffective against it, so there was an urgent need to develop new medications. Favipiravir (FPV) was one of the most effective drugs and made a great influence in the treatment.\nFavipiravir (6-Fluoro-3-hydroxypyrazine-2-carboxamide) is a purine\u00a0nucleic acid\u00a0analog developed in Japan by Toyama Chemical for the\u00a0treatment\u00a0of\u00a0viral infections. It is a pro-drug\u00a0that is ribosylated and phosphorylated intracellularly to form its active metabolite Favipiravir ribofuranosyl-5\u2019-triphosphate (FPV-RTP) that works by inhibiting\u00a0RNA dependent RNA polymerase\u00a0(RdRp)\u00a0 enzyme2. It is currently formulated as tablet dosage form.\nGood results were achieved by the FPV treatment in patients with mild to moderate COVID-19 infections which was indicated by increased discharge rate and less mechanical ventilation3,4. It was also reported that patients who were treated with FPV showed a considerably higher viral clearance rate, after about 2 weeks from initiating FPV treatment5.\nHowever, recent study showed a lack of positive effect of FPV on mortality, that could be attributed to the low plasma concentrations of FPV following oral administration6. Some adverse effects were noted with FPV such as diarrhea, changes in liver function parameters and hyperuricemia7. Accordingly, new dosage forms are being formulated for administration of FPV through lung inhalation8. Furthermore, there is an increasing need to formulate oral solution dosage forms suitable for children use9. Although being just preliminary studies without actual dosage forms in the market till now, these new formulations increased the importance of stability study of FPV especially in solutions. These studies will help optimize the formulation bioavailability and stability10. It\u2019s well known that hydrolysis is the most common pathway for degradation in solutions; therefore,\nOPEN\n1Department of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Zagazig University, Zagazig 44519, Egypt. 2Pharmaceutical Analytical Chemistry Department, College of Pharmaceutical Sciences and Drug Manufacturing, Misr University for Science and Technology, 6th of October City, Giza 12566, Egypt. 3Department of Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Cairo University, Cairo 11562, Egypt. *email: mai.hisham@ must.edu.eg\n2 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2023) 13:18512 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-45618-x\nstudying the hydrolytic degradation pathways of FPV is of utmost importance for these formulations to succeed and reach markets.\nGreen chemistry recently represents a universal trend, as a lot of studies are done in which many toxic chemicals and reagents are used, generating toxic waste products. Scientists and researchers should pay attention that these all-hazardous chemicals and wastes be replaced with more green, less toxic and eco-friendly ones. Paul Anastas and John Warner11 announced \u201cThe Twelve Principles of Green Chemistry\u201d which are summarized PRODUCTIVELY. Simply, green chemistry is the usage of chemistry for contamination and toxic waste hindrance. Recently, green chemistry approach was extending to different analytical techniques such as electrochemistry, spectrophotometry, spectrofluorimetry and chromatography12\u201317.\nHPLC technique is the optimum choice among analytical techniques for many pharmaceutical applications such as stability-indicating and assay of pharmaceutical dosage forms. The common presence of organic solvents is always a challenge to develop a green HPLC method. A simple and important mode of HPLC is Micellar liquid chromatography (MLC) which can be used for determination of drugs in pharmaceutical dosage forms and physiological fluids. In MLC separation of charged and uncharged solutes can be achieved using surfactants at a concentration exceeding their critical micelle concentration (CMC)18. MLC offers unique separation selectivity, high reproducibility, robustness, and safety; all these properties grabbed the attention of analysts for MLC19. Selection of surfactant in MLC is based mainly on their CMC. Surfactants with low CMC values are preferred as high CMC surfactants usually lead to a sticky mobile phase, which need higher pressure and may cause noise in the detector response20. Common surfactants used in MLC are sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB), and polyoxyethylene 23 lauryl ether (Brij-35) which are known to be safe and biodegradable. In MLC, monomers of surfactants are adsorbed on the stationary phases thus altering their properties. In addition, they form micelles in the mobile phase that solubilizes the analytes. SDS is a commonly used anionic surfactant for retention of positively charged analytes, while Brij-35 is a non-ionic one. Usually, hybrid mobile phases are used in MLC where a small portion of organic modifiers (3\u201215%) is used with the surfactants to solve the problem of slow mass transfer from the stationary phase19. This problem can also be solved by increasing temperature in the chromatography column to increases the mass transfer kinetics21, or using the non-ionic Brij-35 in combination with SDS22. The presence of Brij-35 can eliminate the need for presence of organic modifiers by decreasing stationary phase polarity. These facts make MLC a green procedure compared to traditional MLC and RP-HPLC.\nAccording to the literature, some methods have been reported for determination of FPV including spectrophotometry23,24, spectrofluorimetry25\u201327, electrochemical28\u201331 and chromatographic methods32\u201349. Although stability studies have been reported for FPV36,37,49, they either lack the eco-friendly advantage, or use expensive instruments that are uncommon in QC laboratories (LC\u2013MS).\nThe target of this manuscript is to progress a new simple, specific, and eco-friendly method for the simultaneous determination of FPV and its hydrolytic degradation product in its pure and pharmaceutical dosage form. The method can be further used in the development phase of FPV solution and inhaler formulations."

            "text": "According to previous studies, FPV is more liable to acidic degradation than other conditions36,37,49, so in this experiment acidic degradation was applied to obtain the hydrolytic degradation product of FPV. HCL (1.0 N) was added to FPV and refluxed in water bath at 100\u00a0\u00b0C, a sample was taken after different time intervals (1, 2 and 3\u00a0h), neutralized with NaOH, evaporated, and dissolved in methanol. To monitor the progress of degradation, solutions were spotted on TLC plates and developed using mobile phase of ethyl acetate: methanol: ammonia (2: 4: 0.1, by volume). Two spots were noticed after 1\u00a0h for FPV and the possible hydrolytic degradation product, but after 2 and 3\u00a0h one spot only for degradation was observed. For further confirmation, degradation solutions were injected into HPLC after 1\u00a0h showed a small peak at the same retention time of FPV but after 2 and 3\u00a0h, this peak completely disappeared. Therefore, the time for complete degradation of FPV was set at 2\u00a0h.\nFPV structure contains an amide group which may be subjected to hydrolysis in acidic media. To confirm this hypothesis FPV and ADP were subjected to IR and LC/MS. The IR spectrum of FPV showed forked peak at 3400\u00a0 cm\u22121 which represents NH2 group of the amide (Fig.\u00a01a). On the other hand, spectrum of ADP shows no forked peak of NH2 besides the appearance of broad peak of OH stretching at 3440\u00a0 cm\u22121 characteristic to COOH group (Fig.\u00a01b). Furthermore, the mass spectrum of ADP was obtained; it showed a peak at 157\u00a0m/z corresponding to ADP molecular weight The structure of the degradation product is not the main objective of our study. We focus on the stability indicating nature of the proposed method to help develop new solution dosage forms for FPV that will help treating COVID-19. However, our suggested structure is augmented with IR and mass spectra and the fact that it was already reported in literature. However, we will explain the findings that can be drawn from the mass spectrum in this reply but will not be added to the manuscript.\nThe molecular ion peak corresponding to the degradation product itself showed a weak peak at m/z = 157 (M-1) despite having M.Wt. of 158, as ESI was operated in negative ion mode, Fig.\u00a02.\nThis may suggest that FPV hydrolytic degradation is feasible through cleavage of the amide bond by protonation-addition-deprotonation-protonation-elimination-deprotonation (PADPED) mechanism, resulting in carboxylic acid and ammonium chloride salt50. Figure\u00a03 shows the suggested degradation pathway of FPV."
