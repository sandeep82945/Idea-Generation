    "abstractText": "The rise of machine learning has greatly influenced the field of computational chemistry, and that of atomistic molecular dynamics simulations in particular. One of its most exciting prospects is the development of accurate, full-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PESs) for molecules and clusters, which, however, often require thousands to tens of thousands of ab initio data points restricting the community to medium sized molecules and/or lower levels of theory (e.g. DFT). Transfer learning, which improves a global PES from a lower to a higher level of theory, offers a data efficient alternative requiring only a fraction of the high level data (on the order of 100 are found to be sufficient for malonaldehyde). The present work demonstrates that even with Hartree-Fock theory and a double-zeta basis set as the lower level model, transfer learning yields CCSD(T)-level quality for H-transfer barrier energies, harmonic frequencies and H-transfer tunneling splittings. Most importantly, finite-temperature molecular dynamics simulations on the sub-\u03bcs time scale in the gas phase are possible and the infrared spectra determined from the transfer learned PESs are in good agreement with experiment. It is concluded that routine, long-time atomistic simulations on PESs fulfilling CCSD(T)-standards become possible.",

One of its most exciting prospects is the development of accurate, full-dimensional potential energy surfaces (PESs) for molecules and clusters, which, however, often require thousands to tens of thousands of ab initio data points restricting the community to medium sized molecules and/or lower levels of theory (e.g. DFT). Transfer learning, which improves a global PES from a lower to a higher level of theory, offers a data efficient alternative requiring only a fraction of the high level data (on the order of 100 are found to be sufficient for malonaldehyde). The present work demonstrates that even with Hartree-Fock theory and a double-zeta basis set as the lower level model, transfer learning yields CCSD(T)-level quality for H-transfer barrier energies, harmonic frequencies and H-transfer tunneling splittings. Most importantly, finite-temperature molecular dynamics simulations on the sub-\u00b5s time scale in the gas phase are possible and the infrared spectra determined from the transfer learned PESs are in good agreement with experiment. It is concluded that routine, long-time atomistic simulations on PESs fulfilling CCSD(T)-standards become possible."

            "text": "Over the past decade, machine learning-based approaches have persistently influenced the field of computational chemistry as a whole and that of atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulations in particular.1\u20133 Machine learning (ML) approaches begin to be routinely used in areas ranging from reaction planning,4,5 to drug design6,7 and to the construction and use of accurate local and global potential energy surfaces (PESs).3,8\u201310 Common to all these applications is that they are data-driven, i.e. they depend on the amount but also on the quality of the available data on which the statistical models are trained. With respect to the underly-\n2\ning models themselves, much flexibility exists, encompassing kernel- or neural network-based approaches with a wide range of architectures and specific design choices.2,3,8,9,11\nThe construction of a multidimensional PES suitable for routine and robust MD simulations remains a challenging task.12 An established approach consists of precomputing reference energies and forces from electronic structure methods at suitable and affordable levels of theory for a given molecule or system, also often with particular applications such as various spectroscopies or reaction dynamics in mind. Traditionally, these energies were used to fit predetermined parametrized forms which in turn not only provide the total energy of the system but also analytical derivatives for forces required in MD simulations. The difficulty in such approaches consists in \u201cguessing\u201d sufficiently flexible forms of the parametrization to capture local and global features of the PES alike. Also, such parametrized fits are often highly nonlinear which is another challenge, in particular for high-dimensional PESs.\nML methods, including (reproducing) kernel13,14 or neural network (NN) approaches,15,16 have been long known to be flexible function approximators.17 It is precisely this flexibility that is also beneficial for the representation of molecular PESs which can have a wide range of topographies and designing parametrizations suitable for capturing all relevant features becomes increasingly difficult.\nHere, the construction, improvement and use of reactive PESs in ring-polymer instanton (RPI) calculations and MD simulations is discussed with the purpose of illustrating practical aspects and probing the quality of the resulting surfaces. The method employed to improve PESs from a lower level (LL) to a higher level (HL) of theory is transfer learning (TL)18\u201320 which is rooted in the notion that the overall topographies of molecular PESs at different levels of theory are often similar. As an example, it is often found that the number of local minima is comparable or even identical if quantum chemical methods at different\n3\nlevels of theory are employed, whereas the geometrical structures of course differ. This topographical similarity can be exploited in TL approaches in that measured amounts of HL information are used to locally distort the model based on LL data. One particular focus in the present work is on studying the influence of the level of electronic structure theory used to construct the surrogate LL model on the quality of the HL PES and making best use of the data generated. To the best of our knowledge this contribution presents the first systematic analysis of the influence of the LL PES in TL of global reactive molecular potential energy surfaces.\nMalonaldehyde (MA) is a well-studied molecule experimentally21\u201328 and from computations29\u201333 and provides a suitable benchmark system for the present work and recent results34 serve as a reference. The properties used for evaluating the quality of the final PESs include energies (e.g. RMSE(E) from comparison to ab initio reference), barrier heights for hydrogen transfer (H-transfer), harmonic frequencies \u03c9 (allowing comparison with experiments25,35 and ab initio results34), and tunneling splittings \u2206H/D (allowing comparison to experiment21\u201323 and literature34). Alternative/additional observables include H-transfer rates and infrared spectra inferred from MD simulations which can also be compared with experiment.\nThe present work is structured as follows. First, the methods including the NN-based representation of the PESs and TL are discussed. Then, the results comprising out of sample errors, energy barriers, harmonic frequencies and tunneling splittings as well as the results from an aggregate of 1.5 \u00b5s of MD simulations are presented. Finally, the results are discussed in a broader context and compared to previous experiments and computational work.\n4"

The total potential energy of a molecule with N atoms for a given geometry is given by\nE = N\u2211 i=1 Ei + ke N\u2211 i=1 N\u2211 j>i qiqj rij\n(1)\nwhere Ei are the atomic contributions to the total energy of the molecule, ke is Coulomb\u2019s constant and the second term describes pairwise electrostatic contributions. Note that the partial charges qi are corrected for charge conservation and that the electrostatic contribution is damped at small inter-atomic distances rij due to the singularity (for details see Reference 15). The forces F and Hessians H are obtained analytically from reverse mode automatic differentiation37 as implemented in Tensorflow38 and the dipole moment is calculated as\n\u00b5 = N\u2211 i=1 qiri. (2)\nThe learnable parameters in PhysNet were fit to reference ab initio energies, forces and dipole moments following the procedure described in Reference 15. Note that the partial charges qi were adapted to best reproduce the dipole moment from the ab initio calculations.\n5\nRecently, TL20,39 and related approaches including \u2206-ML40\u201342 have become very popular and successful in improving a given LL PES to a HL of theory. At its core, TL builds on the knowledge acquired by solving one task (representing the LL PES) to solve a new, related task (representing the HL PES).20 In practice, the parameters of the LL PES are used as a good initial guess and are fine-tuned with little, though judiciously, chosen HL information. In this work, all parameters of PhysNet were allowed to change in the TL step.\n2.2 Ab Initio Data\nAll molecular structures that were used to in the fitting procedure of PhysNet were available from earlier work33 and their sampling process is described in detail in Reference 33. The data set contains structures for MA, acetoacetaldehyde (3-oxobutanal), acetylacetone (pentan-2, 4-dion) as well as a total of 49 substructures as motivated by the \u201damon\u201d approach.43 An initial set of structures was generated by running Langevin dynamics at 1000 K using the semi-empirical PM7 method44 as implemented in MOPAC.45 Next, ab initio energies, forces and dipole moments were determined at the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ (aVTZ) level of theory using MOLPRO46 and were used to train two preliminary PhysNet models. The preliminary models were then used to suitably augment the data set using adaptive sampling.47 The final data set contained MP2/aVTZ level energies, forces and molecular dipole moments for a total of 71 208 structures including all three molecules and their amons. This PES is referred to as PhysNetMP2.\nTo be able to study the influence of the LL on the quality of the HL, the data set containing 71 208 structures from earlier work33 was recalculated at two additional \u201dlow\u201d levels of theory, namely HF/cc-pVDZ (VDZ) and B3LYP/aVTZ using MOLPRO.46 The two new data sets are used to learn representations of the PES using PhysNet and are termed PhysNetHF and PhysNetB3LYP, respectively. The relative CPU times for the ab initio calculations (that include energies, forces and dipole moments) are roughly 1:10:170:4000 for the HF/VDZ,\n6\nB3LYP/aVTZ, MP2/aVTZ and CCSD(T)/aVTZ levels of theory, respectively.\nThe CCSD(T)/aVTZ level of theory was chosen as higher level of theory, which is computationally much more demanding, and will serve as target in the TL step.34 Although the determination of forces and dipole moments is roughly an order of magnitude more expensive than an energy-only calculation, the information gained from including gradients (27 components for malonaldehyde) and dipole moments is considerable. The data set sizes employed in the TL step of the present work include N = [25, 50, 100, 862] (corresponding to TL0, TL1, TL2 and TLext) MA structures. Except for N = 862 (which corresponds to an extended data set that contains all HL information.34) the MA structures were augmented iteratively and are specifically chosen to ideally cover all relevant spatial regions (i.e. structures on and around the minimum energy path, instanton path, global minimum and transition state) of the PESs that were found to be important for the determination of the tunneling splitting.34 The resulting TL PESs corresponding to the LL models (PhysNetHF, PhysNetB3LYP or PhysNetMP2) are termed TLxy with x\u2208[HF, B3LYP, MP2] and y\u2208[0, 1, 2, ext]."

MAE(E) for all models are below 0.05 kcal/mol and are lowest for PhysNetMP2 (0.02 kcal/mol).

The MAE(F ) are within 0.008 kcal/mol/A\u030a for all three LL PESs while the RMSE(F ) differ by \u223c 0.1 kcal/mol/A\u030a at most. The correlation and the errors of the PhysNet energies with respect to the respective\n9\nreference ab initio values are shown in Figure 1 for the test set.\nThe barrier for H-transfer from the ab initio calculations varied between 9.96, to 2.98 and 2.74 kcal/mol for the HF, B3LYP and MP2 level of theory, respectively.

These barrier heights compare with 4.03 kcal/mol and 4.09 kcal/mol from high-level CCSD(T) calculations of different flavours.8,31\nHarmonic frequencies constitute an additional measure for the accuracy of a PES around a stationary point. The MAEs and the RMSEs for the harmonic frequencies of the global minimum of MA for all LL PESs are reported in Table 1. While the MAEs (RMSEs) for all LL PESs are below 5 (7) cm\u22121, the errors for PhysNetHF are slightly larger by approximately a factor of 2 compared to PhysNetB3LYP and PhysNetMP2, which are within 0.1 cm\u22121 of one another. The actual deviation of the PhysNet harmonic frequencies with respect to their reference is shown in Figure 2 for the global minimum of MA.

The tunneling splitting is exquisitely sensitive to the quality and accuracy of the PES along and around the instanton path comprising the minimum energy structure and the region near the transition state. The tunneling splitting for H-transfer, \u2206H, ranges from 0.036, to 71.1 and to 96.3 cm\u22121 for PhysNetHF, PhysNetB3LYP and PhysNetMP2.

On account of the small HL data set sizes (including N = [25, 50, 100, 862] for TL0, TL1, TL2 and TLext), each TL is repeated 10 times on different splits of the data. The energy barriers EB for the different HL PESs together with their variation are shown in Figure 3 for all TLs (transparent circles). Their averages and standard deviations are indicated as opaque circles and error bars,\n12\nrespectively. The gray dashed line corresponds to the ab initio CCSD(T)/aVTZ energy barrier determined in previous work.34 While TLB3LYP0 and TL MP2 0 (i.e. requiring only 25 data points) already yield EB within 0.003 kcal/mol of the ab initio CCSD(T)/aVTZ barrier, the deviation of \u223c 0.06 kcal/mol for TLHF0 is slightly larger. For all larger data set sizes, the energy barrier for H-transfer of the HL PESs are accurate and equal among themselves to within \u223c 0.01 kcal/mol. Overall, TL from all LL models yields HL models with EB for H-transfer to within 0.06 kcal/mol of the reference value from ab initio CCSD(T)/aVTZ calculations determined in previous work.34 This ab initio CCSD(T)/aVTZ barrier of 3.895 kcal/mol compares to values of 4.09 and 4.03 kcal/mol as obtained at the CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pV5Z (optimization carried out at CCSD(T)/aVTZ level) and fc-CCSD(T) (F12*)/def2-TZVPP level of theory, respectively.8,31\nThe energy barrier EB for H-transfer is a local, rather low dimensional property of a PES.\n13\nConversely, harmonic frequencies for stationary points probe the curvature of the PES in all directions. Figure 4 shows the MAE and RMSEs of ensemble predictions (i.e. an average over 10 TLs) for the global minimum of MA of TLHF, TLB3LYP and TLMP2 for the different TL data set sizes (i.e. 25, 50, 100, 862). Averaged errors below 6 cm\u22121 are achieved for all HL PESs with as little as 25 data points. TL with 100 CCSD(T)/aVTZ data points the MAEs (RMSEs) are further reduced to 2.4, 1.3 and 1.5 (3.4, 1.8 and 2.0) cm\u22121 for TLHF2 ,\n14\nTLB3LYP2 and TL MP2 2 , respectively. The RMSEs between the ab initio HF/B3LYP/MP2 harmonic frequencies and the high-level CCSD(T) frequencies are 177, 28 and 21 cm\u22121 for HF, B3LYP and MP2, respectively, and provides an impression by how much the shape of the LL PESs need to adjust around the minimum at the TL step.\nThe tunneling splitting is sensitive to the local dynamics and the PES\u2019s topology around the H-transfer instanton path. Hydrogen and deuterium tunneling splittings were used as target\n15\nobservables in recent work for the iterative and systematic construction of different data sets based on PhysNetMP2.34 Figure 5 presents the tunneling splittings for H-transfer and D-transfer as calculated from all different HL PESs (TLHF0 to TL MP2 ext ). Again, their averages and standard deviations are shown as opaque circles and error bars, respectively. As had been found for EB, the fluctuation is largest for TL HF 0 with tunneling splittings ranging from \u223c 18 to 42 cm\u22121. This fluctuation is smaller by a factor of \u223c 5 for both TLB3LYP0 and TLMP20 . For TL2 the fluctuation among the three classes of HL PES become comparable. Average \u2206H of 20.7, 22.9 and 25.2 cm\u22121 are found for TLHF2 , TL B3LYP 2 and TL MP2 2 . Increasing the data set size to 862 (TLext) further reduces both the differences within the classes and the standard deviation of the ensemble predictions. Here, average \u2206H of 23.2, 23.9 and 25.3 cm \u22121 are found for TLHFext, TL B3LYP ext and TL MP2 ext , respectively. It is noted, that \u2206H from TL MP2 only marginally changed upon increasing the TL data set size from 100 to 862 (TL2 to TLext). Similar observations hold for D-transfer, which indicates that TLMP22 is basically converged with MP2 as the LL model."

As a TL data set size of 100 CCSD(T) data points (TL2) is a very realistic scenario for final predictions (i.e. allows to check for convergence of the results and a small enough data set size to be amenable also for larger systems), a representative PES (from the 10 independent TL executions) was chosen for each of the three TL classes (i.e. TLHF2 , TLB3LYP2 and TL MP2 2 ).\nH-transfer rates obtained from counting H-transfers and dividing by total simulation time from the MD simulations at 300 and 500 K are reported in Table 2. The rates at both temperatures agree to approximately 30 % and correspond to \u223c 1 (34) transfers per ns at\n16\n300 (500) K. It is interesting to note that the trend at 300 K (i.e. lowest rate for TLHF followed by LB3LYP and TLMP2) reverses at 500 K. Overall, the rates for TLB3LYP and TLMP2 are more similar to one another.\nThe simulation run at 300 K were further used to compute IR spectra as calculated from the dipole-dipole autocorrelation function, see Figure 6 (middle panel) for TLHF2 , TL B3LYP 2 and TLMP22 . As additional reference, an IR spectrum was also calculated on TL MP2 ext which, starting from the MP2 LL PES, has been trained on an extended TL data set containing 862 CCSD(T) data points and is thus expected to yield results closest to simulations on a - hypothetical - PhysNet PES trained on CCSD(T)/aVTZ reference data. The spectra derived from the dynamics on the HL PESs are very similar with one another. Single deviations can,\n17\ne.g. be found at \u223c 230 cm\u22121 or at \u223c 1650 cm\u22121, where TLHF2 has no or only a small fraction of the intensity in comparison to the other spectra, respectively.

For example, the intensity of the peak at \u223c 1620 cm\u22121 is twice as large for TLHF2 and the line positions of TL HF 2 and TL B3LYP 2 at \u223c 1260 cm\u22121 are shifted to the blue by \u223c 3 cm\u22121 compared to TLMP22 and TLMP2ext , respectively. The bottom panel shows the direct comparison of TLMP2 with the experimental spectrum determined in Reference 35 and illustrates the excellent agreement for frequencies between 500 and 1500 cm\u22121. Somewhat larger deviations are found for peaks at \u223c 1650 and 2900 cm\u22121.

All computed spectra are consistent among themselves and agree reasonably well. The top panel shows the difference spectra of TLHF2 , TLB3LYP2 and TL MP2 2 with respect to TL MP2 ext which are shifted for clarity. The smallest overall differences are found for TLMP2. The bottom panel shows the direct comparison of TLMP22 with the experimental spectrum determined in Reference 35 and illustrate the excellent agreement for frequencies between 500 and 1500 cm\u22121. Somewhat larger deviations are found for peaks at \u223c 1650 and 2900 cm\u22121. Note that HCl impurities are observed at frequencies around 3000 cm\u22121, see Reference 35 for details.\ntical if 50 to 100 HL data points were used in the TL step. Two-dimensional projections of the LL PESs compared with the best HL target PES are reported in Figure 7. This provides a low-dimensional impression of the amount of reshaping that is conveyed by the TL step because all TL-PESs from the three LL reference calculations yield comparable final PESs.\n19\nProperties for which the performance of the transfer learned PESs were evaluated and compared included the barrier for H-transfer, the tunneling splittings, harmonic frequencies and IR spectra from finite-temperature MD simulations in the gas phase. All results suggest that the level of theory of the LL PES has only a minor influence on the quality of the resulting HL PES, although starting from a \u201dbetter LL PES\u201d (e.g. B3LYP/aVTZ) might have slight\n20\nadvantages such as a shorter training time for TL. As an example, TL from PhysNetHF to CCSD(T)/aVTZ based on 100 points required one order of magnitude more epochs than PhysNetB3LYP or PhysNetMP2. Thus, although transfer learning a surrogate model at the HF/aVDZ level yields a HL model of almost identical quality compared to TLB3LYP2 and TLMP22 , the B3LYP/aVTZ level of theory may offer the best cost/accuracy ratio.\nStarting from \u201dequivalent\u201d LL PESs in terms of representation error, a HL PESs of gold standard CCSD(T) quality was sought after and generated using TL. As an example for the performance of the TL step, normal mode frequencies are considered. The three LL PES achieve outstanding accuracy with respect to the frequencies from ab initio normal mode calculations at the respective levels of theory for both, the minimum energy structure and for the H-transfer transition state. PhysNetB3LYP is most accurate with MAE(\u03c9) = 2.6, RMSE(\u03c9) = 3.5 cm\u22121 and a maximum absolute error of \u223c 8.7 cm\u22121 for the global minimum of MA. This compares favourably with state of the art art PESs for molecules of similar sizes. A recent permutationally invariant polynomial (PIP) PES for tropolone yields MAE(\u03c9)min between 1.7 and 12.7 cm\u22121 the reported MAE(\u03c9)TS ranges from 8.4 cm\u22121 to 18.6 cm\u22121, depending on chosen PIP basis and other method-specific parameters.59 PIPand PhysNet-based PESs for the formic acid dimer find MAE(\u03c9)min of 14.9 and 6.4 cm\u22121, respectively.60\u201362 Comparing the harmonic frequencies from the LL PESs (HF, B3LYP and MP2) with the target level of theory, CCSD(T), reflects the amount of reshaping of the PES that is required in the TL step to reach the reported performance. This needs to be compared with differences in the harmonic frequencies at the ab initio HF/B3LYP/MP2 levels compared with the CCSD(T) frequencies34 with an RMSE of 177, 28 and 21 cm\u22121 for HF, B3LYP and MP2, respectively. TL with only 100 HL data points correctly reshaped the LL PESs with a MAE(\u03c9) < 3 and RMSE(\u03c9) < 4 cm\u22121 (i.e. the same accuracy as for the most accurate LL PES, PhysNetB3LYP, trained on several ten thousand structures), respectively, and impressively illustrates the data efficiency of TL. This translates into improvements of\n21\n1 to 2 orders of magnitude in accuracy for normal mode frequencies between reference and transfer-learned models\nIt is also valuable to consider the accuracy of the computed harmonic frequencies in light of the computational effort to obtain such frequencies (especially at the CCSD(T) level of theory) based on standard ab initio techniques. As is well established in the community, optimizations and frequency calculations at the CCSD(T) level of theory are tremendously time and resource intensive, especially for larger and complex systems. Starting from, e.g. PhysNetB3LYP, required only 100 HL CCSD(T) data points (that include energies, forces and dipole moments) to achieve close to spectroscopic accuracy (i.e. more than 60 % of the frequencies with sub-1 cm\u22121 accuracy and a maximum deviation of \u223c 4 cm\u22121 with respect to ab initio CCSD(T) reference). ML methods, especially in combination with data-efficient TL or related \u2206-ML approaches, therefore offer an attractive time-saving alternative as has been demonstrated here. This is highlighted by recent ab initio LCCSD(T)-F12/cc-pVTZF12 calculations for 15-atom tropolone, for which the optimization and frequency calculation took 73 days on 12 cores.63\nThe present findings underscore the importance for a sufficiently detailed LL model when aiming to construct a high-quality, versatile PES based on as little HL data as possible. This is shown by comparing to a model trained on the TL2 (100 CCSD(T) data points) data set from scratch, i.e. without pre-training. The resulting model is predicts the energy barrier moderately well (a deviation of \u223c 0.05 kcal/mol with respect to reference), but has significantly larger errors for harmonic frequencies (i.e. MAE(\u03c9) > 25 cm\u22121) than all TLxy models. In addition, starting MA structure optimization close to the stationary point is necessary for meaningful results. As anticipated, the attempt to run a MD simulation on such a PES fails entirely after a few time steps even at a rather low temperature of 300 K, which renders the PES unsuitable for dynamics studies.\n22\nContrary to the model trained from scratch, TL enables to obtain a very HL representation of a global PES with very limited HL data points and, thus, allows to carry out dynamical assessments of a system. In this contribution this has been illustrated for the IR spectrum of MA and compared to experiment, for which good agreement is found. Since the TL data set contains only few structures which are chosen rather close to the global minimum and H-transfer transition state, it is conceivable that elevated temperatures lead to sampling structures with stronger distortions which are not fully covered by the TL data set. To the best of our knowledge, it is yet to be examined how a LL PES is transformed in regions where no TL data is supplied and presents a promising avenue for further investigation. Nevertheless, this very attractive route employing TL to obtain HL PESs allows CCSD(T)-quality MD simulations on the microsecond time scale for medium sized molecules. As an indication for the reduction in computing time achieved for MA it is noted that 1 ns of ML/MD simulation takes 12 CPU hours whereas the same simulation with ab initio MD simulations at the CCSD(T)/aVTZ level would take 2.2 \u00b7 107 hours, i.e. \u223c 2 \u00b7 106 longer, i.e. they are unfeasible. Of course such comparisons depend somewhat on the computer architecture and implementation used, but serve as an illustration that approaches as those discussed in the present work open possibilities to combine accuracy, system size and simulation lengths to approache CCSD(T)-level quality in sub\u00b5s simulations that were unachievable with more established methods. With regards to PES generation, TL alleviates the problem of requiring thousands to tens of thousands of HL ab initio data points. This is a major step forward making highest levels of theory accessible. The adaptation of this approach to ML/MM simulations is a promising avenue towards stable, energy conserving, long-time quantitative condensed phase simulations.\n23"

Because the computational effort to evaluate energies and forces of a PES based on a NN does not depend on the level of ab initio theory used to conceive the representation, extensive and routine sub-\u00b5s gas-phase ML//MD and condensed-phase ML/MM//MD simulations with the solvent treated with molecular mechanics become possible and are in reach.\nData Availability Statement\nThe MP2/aVTZ data set taken from previous work33 is available on zenodo (https:// zenodo.org/record/3629239#.ZBhlJ47MJH4) and the PhysNet codes are available at https: //github.com/MMunibas/PhysNet. Additional data sets generated during and/or analysed during the current study are available from the authors upon reasonable request."
