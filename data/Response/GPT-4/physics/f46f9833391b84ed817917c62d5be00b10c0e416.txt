Development of Improved Protecting Group Strategies for PNA Synthesis: Given the complexity of PNA synthesis, especially regarding the protecting groups for the nucleobases and the backbone, further research could focus on developing new or improved protecting group strategies that enhance solubility, reduce side reactions, and are more easily removed. This could involve exploring novel chemistries or borrowing concepts from peptide and oligonucleotide synthesis that have yet to be applied to PNAs.

Advancements in Solid-Phase Synthesis Techniques for PNAs: The paper highlights the use of polystyrene and PEG-based resins in the synthesis of PNAs. Future research could explore the development of new solid supports that minimize interchain aggregation and improve the efficiency of chain elongation. This might include the design of resin materials with better solvent and reagent accessibility or the incorporation of linkers that prevent aggregation.

Synthesis of PNA-Peptide and PNA-DNA Chimeras: Considering the potential of PNAs in therapeutic and diagnostic applications, there's an opportunity to further explore the synthesis of PNA-peptide and PNA-DNA chimeras. Research could focus on creating more efficient methods for the synthesis of these conjugates, including strategies for seamless integration of PNA sequences with peptides or DNA to enhance cellular uptake, specificity, and biological activity.

Exploration of PNA Modifications for Enhanced Biological Activity: The unique properties of PNAs open up possibilities for modifications that could enhance their stability, binding affinity, and specificity towards target RNA or DNA sequences. Future research could investigate the synthesis of PNAs with modified backbones, introduction of chiral centers, or incorporation of pseudo-complementary nucleobases to improve their biological activity and utility in gene regulation or molecular diagnostics.

Automation and Scale-Up of PNA Synthesis: As PNAs move closer to clinical applications, there will be a growing need for large-scale synthesis methods that are both efficient and cost-effective. Research could focus on the automation of PNA synthesis, including the development of robotic systems or flow chemistry approaches that can streamline the synthesis process, reduce waste, and improve the purity and yield of the final products. This would also involve optimizing protocols for the synthesis of specific PNA sequences or modifications that are of interest in therapeutic development.
