    "abstractText": "The application of cylindrical and spherical symmetries for numerical studies of many-body problems is presented. It is shown that periodic boundary conditions corresponding to formally cylindrical symmetry allow for reducing the problem of a huge number of interacting particles, minimizing the effect of boundary conditions, and obtaining reasonably correct results from a practical point of view. A physically realizable cylindrical configuration is also studied. The advantages and disadvantages of symmetric realizations are discussed. Finally, spherical symmetry, which naturally realizes a three-dimensional system without boundaries on its two-dimensional surface, is studied. As an example, tectonic dynamics are considered, and interesting patterns resembling real ones are found. It is stressed that perturbations of the axis of planet rotation may be responsible for the formation of such patterns.",

            "text": "Numerical models are often used for solving complex problems in many fields [1\u20135]. They allow researchers to observe complex systems in artificially created scenarios. This makes it possible to identify the major governing parameters and study the underlying physics. Using these observations, one can later develop sophisticated quantitative models. To be efficient, a heuristic model must account for important features of the phenomenon and its main governing factors. We often consider it useful to construct mechanical systems from some interacting blocks (or \u2018particles\u2019). The interactions between them must fulfill certain generic properties, e.g., for solids they should enable the system to sustain its shape, and this should be implemented in the model. The atomic lattice of crystalline solids is responsible for the long-range order in a solid. Its existence is owing to the physics of interatomic interactions. Such a description has general validity and also applies to amorphous solids and even fluids. It also applies to fracture processes, which occur via the subdivision of a solid into fragments before separation. The analogous approach can be applied to describe various phenomena and systems, such as pattern formation in nature, the mixing of powders, and the behavior of dynamic systems (see, for example [6,7]). At present, it is still not possible to advance to satisfactory length and time scales by using classical molecular dynamics that operate with atoms or molecules. That is why representative objects are often used as particles, whose motion, in its entirety, reflects the pertinent aspects of the behavior of the system. For example, the moveable cellular automata [1], smooth particle hydrodynamics [2], and discrete automata methods [3,6,7] can be mentioned. Note that visualization and processing of the results of the computations are very involved [7]. In this context, the reduction in computation costs is essentially important if one needs a relatively long-term simulation to obtain physically interesting results.\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 1557. https://doi.org/10.3390/sym14081557 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/symmetry\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 1557 2 of 13\nBelow we will present one of them, which applies (virtually or naturally) cylindrical and spherical symmetries to reduce the calculation time and memory consumption. Our concern in the present work is primarily the extraction of qualitative information from numerical simulations, with convenient access to direct visualization for various scenarios and over long durations. To do this, we used the isotropic \u2018moveable automata\u2019 technique (cf., e.g., [3,7]), which involves a weak, long-range interaction between particles in addition to a short-range repulsive one. The form of the interparticle interactions used ensures the existence of a minimum overall potential and the attendant equilibrium state. Such a system does not require \u2018walls\u2019 created by the boundary conditions to form compact fragments of a crystalline lattice. Even in the case when the average density of the material is lower than that required for contiguous space-filling, the particles show a tendency to aggregate [7,8]. With these considerations in mind, we use a model whose details are given below. In solving the equations of motion, we confined ourselves to problems where the thermal energy kBT, where T is the absolute temperature and kB is the Boltzmann constant, is negligibly small compared to other energy terms involved. However, as is usual in dynamics, mutual transformations between potential and kinetic energy still exist. It can be proven [9] that in the limit of high kinetic energy density, Ekin >> Cij, where Cij is a stiffness parameter, the system behaves similar to a gas of nearly free-flying particles. In the opposite limit case, Ekin << Cij, a crystal lattice is formed spontaneously. The nodes of the lattice oscillate around the bottoms of the potential valleys formed by the neighboring particles. It can be described in terms of a harmonic Hamiltonian, slightly perturbed by non-linear terms. In this sense, the system deforms elastically. While in the gaseous state, the system is isotropic on average, and in the solid state, its lattice has a hexagonal symmetry if the interaction potential between the particles is isotropic. In both limited cases, the system exhibits regular dynamic behavior. However, due to a difference in symmetry, there is a transition between the two states via a mixed disordered state, which, in the presence of dissipation, represents a viscous fluid. Thus, the minimalist model considered accounts for the occurrence of all three aggregate states of the system."

The minimization condition corresponding to an equilibrium reads as follows: Cij >> Dij, cij < dij. Since the parameters Cij, Dij, cij, and dij form arrays covering all possible combinations, it can be said, without loss of generality, that the equations of motion\nmi\u2202vi/\u2202t = \u2212\u2202H(xi, pi)/\u2202pi = fi, (3)\ndescribe systems with any number of components, including one- and two-component systems, which are of interest in this paper. There is a requirement to specify the parameters C11, C22, C12 = C21, etc. In standard numerical experiments, the particles are initially placed at random on a rectangle with the side lengths of [0, Lx] and [0, Ly]. In addition, in the case of contact with a thermal bath, the boundary conditions need to be accompanied by additional ones. If the temperature T of the thermal bath at a given boundary (or within the system) is non-zero,\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 1557 3 of 13\nan array of random \u03b4-correlated Langevin forces need to be included.

Independently of the thermal source, the interaction between the particles produces kinetic energy and causes effective thermalization of the system. So, one has to introduce a dissipation channel acting to equilibrate the relative velocities of particles that happen to be within the distance cv close to the equilibrium. This can be performed by additive force\nf vi \u223c N\n\u2211 j=1\n(vi \u2212 vj) exp [ \u2212[(ri \u2212 rj)/cv]2 ] (5)\nacting on the i-th particle, with yet another dissipation constant \u03b7.

            "text": "The simplicity of the equations of motion is deceptive. Summation occurs at every time step over all possible neighbors, including very distant ones. At the same time, to obtain a more or less realistic model of the system and exclude the effect of boundary conditions that are too close, one normally needs a sufficiently large number of \u201cparticles\u201d. It becomes especially important when a long-duration run of the numerical simulation (which often reflects the long duration of the real physical experiment) is needed. For example, this problem appears when one models a process of strong shear deformation, which causes plastic transformations of the material, which results in so-called soli-state turbulence [9]. If the numerically generated system is too short, movable automata quickly reach a boundary of the specimen in a direction of shear deformation and repulse from it back to the internal regions of the system. It completely modifies the numerically obtained results, which strongly deviate from the picture of the real process. To avoid such an artifact, one has to apply as remote a boundary in the direction of shear as possible. To conserve a reasonably limited number of the automata in the numerical procedure, one has to reduce the width of the system in the orthogonal direction. A system that is too narrow with close boundaries in the orthogonal direction also gives some uncontrollable corrections. In such a case, it is convenient to employ periodic boundary conditions on the horizontal axis. Accordingly, a particle leaving the interval [0, Lx] is returned to it at the opposite end, and the vectors ri \u2212 rj connect particles located within the interval [0, Lx] or the images of escaped particles at the opposite side of the system. On the vertical axis, the system is limited by plates at y = 0 and y = Ly with reflecting boundary conditions: Uup = C exp[(y\u2212 Ly)/c] and Udown = C exp[\u2212y/c]. The stronger the inequalities C >> Cij and c << cij, the more rigid and sharp the walls are in relation to other forces and lengths relevant to the system.

They definitely appear in different places and time moments and travel as energy waves along the system following the \u201cevents\u201d corresponding to strong changes of the lattice due to mutual collisions of the ordered domains, and so on.

Watching the Movie_01.avi, one can observe how (initially randomly placed) relatively small islands of the rigid component collide with one another and form larger ordered \u201cdomains\u201d, moving and even rotating as a whole. However, they also can split into smaller ones again. The long-duration run allows us to accumulate statistics and observe that the distribution of the domain sizes becomes stationary. Another opposite process is normally organized in the experimental studies [9], where originally, a stripe of the hard material is placed between two soft ones. In this case, it deforms (elastically and plastically) and then splits into a set of islands moving and rotating as a whole. Their distribution tends to be the same equilibrium (stationary, but not static) as the opposite limit. The early infant stage of this process is illustrated in Figure 2, accompanied by the Movie_02.avi [11], reproducing the initial stage of the process in dynamics. One can see the plastic deformation (and destruction into the separate parts later on) of the rigid layer was definitely accompanied by local excitations and even avalanches of them.

This behavior is reproduced in the Movie_3.avi [12]. All the mentioned processes are clearly seen in dynamics in the sequence of the movies Movie_03.avi, Movie_04.avi, and Movie_05.avi [12\u201314] where direct observation is accompanied by the curves giving quantitative information during the long (potentially infinite) run. In particular, one can see how the time\u2013space map of the horizontal velocity of a selected vertical cross-section recording is static. It records information about the history of the events (wave propagation and their avalanches) in the system. For a two-component system, one can numerically analyze images from every frame of the movie and calculate the time depending on the number of domains in the rigid phase, the histogram of the area occupied by the domains of a given size, as well as the size of the maximal and averaged domain shown to accumulate during the long-duration run.

Realistic Quasi-Infinite Objects\nNow let us discuss some physical objects with cylindrical and spherical symmetries,\nwhich can serve as examples of effectively infinite systems. First of all, quite often, long-\nrun shear-force deformations are organized by means of rotating cylindrical systems. The\ntypical configuration of such a system is illustrated in Figure 6 below. Here, an experi-\nmental material is placed between two cylindrical boundaries. The central one is motion-\nless and the external one is rotating. It causes a configuration where different layers of the\nmaterial inside tend to rotate with the velocity, which gradually increases from\nmin( ) 0V R to max( ) extV R V . If both radii are large enough (and in following the sys-\ntem of the coordinates), it is mechanically equivalent to the motion between two plates\nmoving with the velocities max / 2extV V= \u2212 and max / 2extV V= .

The process strongly resembles the same process in the abstract\ncylindrical system studied above. It also can be continued, as far as necessary.\nThe only (but very important) difference that such a system can show exists in reality.\nIt even has its own advantage that the numerical procedure in such a configuration does\nnot need fictional images. So, it is potentially expected to require less computer memory\nand be less time-consuming. However, it still has the disadvantage that due to the geom-\netry, the inner and outer layers of the system are not exactly equivalent. To obtain better\nequivalence, one has to use both relatively large external and internal radiuses. It actually\ndemands a relatively large number of mutually interacting particles (movable automata).\nSpikes of the interaction forces in the places where the domains collide or strongly\ndeform are seen directly in the middle subplot of Figure 6.

It can be roughly divided into two regions\u2014left and right of a vertical dashed line that marks a certain characteristic value p\u2217. The fraction of points where |pi|> p\u2217 holds, i.e., those points where intensive processes occur, evolves with time. The results of this procedure for a particular realization of the deformation process are shown in Figure 3b. One can recognize pronounced bursts of activity, which can be associated with the periods of emergence and development of rebuilt structures localized at the edges of domains (microscopic analogues of the earthquakes) seen in Movie_3.avi [12]. The same periods can also be identified in the time dependence of the total picture presented in Figure 3c. To facilitate th c mparison, some of the bursts are arked with ash-dotted lines.

According to this local circulation, the particle in position rj is given by the following equation:\nrotj = Nproxy\n\u2211 k [(vk \u2212 vj)\u00d7 (rk \u2212 rj)]/(|rk \u2212 rj|). (8)\nDifferential rotation is visualized in the right subplot of Figure 6, and is especially clearly seen in the dynamics of the corresponding Movie_06 [15].

Besides, the collisions between the rocks are clearly marked by the flashes of force colors shown in the central subplot. Let us note in advance that the visualization by means of the colorized rotor is also very useful for the study of rotating systems with spherical symmetry. In the context of the present paper, such symmetry is another realization of a quasi-infinite system existing in nature. It appears when a spherical belt near the surface of the sphere can rotate more or less independently of the rotation of the whole object, for example, when it is an atmosphere or lithosphere of a planet. In both cases, the belts on the surface are partially involved in the rotation either by an effect (in some senses, just physical friction) on the solid surface of the planet or by the continental flotation on magma. It is important to mention that it causes practically the same configuration of the velocities, which was studied above for the shear-induced turbulence. In reality, the velocity of the spherical belt monotonously depends on the latitude. It is maximal near the equator of the planet and has to decrease down to zero near the poles. In fact, one has a doubled picture of the shear-induced motion with two stripes mirroring one another. Despite the complication related to the principally 3D configuration, it paradoxically gives an advantage from the computing point of view. It does not need phantom images of the particles, because the boundary does not exist at all. Certainly, it allows the simulation to run infinitely without any limitation from the boundary conditions. So, one can obtain rather realistic results using a relatively small number of movable automata. The only thing one needs is to add an attraction (gravitation in fact) of the particles to the solid spherical surface. In principle, this force is a combination of the Newtonian gravitation potential Uattract \u223c 1/\n\u2223\u2223rj \u2212 R\u2223\u2223 and exponential repulsion form the surface Urepuls \u223c exp[(rj \u2212 R)/c]. However, in the particular model, one needs only to \u201cglue\u201d the particles to the surface, so the cheapest way is to apply sufficiently strong confinement with the potential Ucon f \u223c (rj \u2212 R)2. Generally speaking, in the case of a spherical surface, the definition rotj = Nproxy\n\u2211 k [(vk \u2212 vj)\u00d7 (rk \u2212 rj)]/(|rk \u2212 rj|) produces a vector in 3D space. To associate it with the vortices and anti-vortices in the spherical belt (of atmo- or lithosphere) we visualize its projection perpendicular to the surface with the coordinate rj and colorize it using the standard MatLab map. It is expected that, due to the general rotation of the \u2018planet\u2019, in the case of ideal laminar flow, the picture will have generally blue and red belts of color on the southern and northern hemispheres and a yellow\u2013green stripe around the equator.\nSymmetry 2022, 14, 1557 10 of 13\nHowever, if the vortices do exist, they will appear as spots of alternative colors (red in southern and blue in northern hemispheres, respectively). For a trial, we start from the surface randomly covered by the relatively soft material (viscous \u201catmosphere\u201d) and allow it to self-organize due to the rotation. As expected, we obtain something similar to layered rotation with some vortices appearing between the layers. This picture reminds us of a Jupiter-like structure. Figure 7 reproduces a sequence of early configurations of the self-organization in a spherical quasi-infinite system. The first reproduces the very beginning of the process, starting from the randomly distributed particles on the sphere (a), followed by two intermediate ones (b)\u2013(c), and the last subplot (d) reproduces a picture close to the stationary moving configuration. In this stage, the parallel belts of the vortices and anti-vortices in the \u201cequatorial\u201d region (shown by red and blue colors, respectively) are already seen.

It is shown that very realistic continental patterns can be obtained under supposition about perturbations of the planet rotation due to external interplanetary interactions or other extraterrestrial reasons.\nAuthor Contributions: Investigation, A.E.F.; Methodology, V.L.P.; Visualization, A.E.F.; Writing\u2014 original draft, A.E.F.; Writing\u2014review & editing, V.L.P.
