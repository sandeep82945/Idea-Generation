    "abstractText": "The biopharmaceutical classification system groups low-solubility drugs into two groups: II and IV, with high and low permeability, respectively. Most of the new drugs developed for common pathologies present solubility issues. This is the case of lurasidone hydrochloride\u2014a drug used for the treatment of schizophrenia and bipolar depression. Likewise, the stability problems of some drugs limit the possibility of preparing them in liquid pharmaceutical forms where hydrolysis and oxidation reactions can be favored. Lurasidone hydrochloride presents the isoindole-1,3-dione ring, which is highly susceptible to alkaline hydrolysis, and the benzisothiazole ring, which is susceptible to a lesser extent to oxidation. Herein, we propose to study the increase in the solubility and stability of lurasidone hydrochloride by the formation of higher-order inclusion complexes with hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin. Several stoichiometric relationships were studied at between 0.5 and 3 hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin molecules per drug molecule. The obtained products were characterized, and their solubility and stability were assessed. According to the obtained results, the formation of inclusion complexes dramatically increased the solubility of the drug, and this increased with the increase in the inclusion ratio. This was associated with the loss of crystalline state of the drug, which was in an amorphous state according to infrared spectroscopy, calorimetry, and X-ray analysis. This was also correlated with the stabilization of lurasidone by the cyclodextrin inhibiting its recrystallization. Phase solubility,1H-NMR, and docking computational characterization suggested that the main stoichiometric ratio was 1:1; however, we cannot rule out a 1:2 ratio, where a second cyclodextrin molecule could bind through the isoindole-1,3-dione ring, improving its stability as well. Finally, we can conclude that the formation of higher-order inclusion complexes of lurasidone with hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin is a successful strategy to increase the solubility and stability of",

Introduction Lurasidone hydrochloride (LRD) is an atypical antipsychotic drug approved by the FDA for treating schizophrenia and bipolar disorder (manic depression) in adults and adolescents [1]. It has been reported to be capable of stabilizing schizophrenia after a short-term usage (~6 weeks) by clinical studies in adult patients using a placebo-controlled, randomized, and double-blinded scheme [2]. It has also shown anxiolytic and antidepressant effects through the combined blockade of the dopamine type-2 (D2) and serotonin type 2A (5-HT2A) receptors [3]. It presents low extrapyramidal activation and neuromotor detriment, along with low central nervous system depression, thus showing few adverse effects. In addition, it has minimal muscarinic and \u03b11 receptor inactivation through blockade [2]. This profile suggests a minor propensity towards weight gain and metabolic dysfunction, while it has high potential for improving cognitive deficits related to schizophrenia [4]. The che ical name of LRD is [3aR,4S,7R,7aS]-2-[(1R,2R)-2-[4-(1,2-benzis thiazol-3-yl)piperazi -1yl-methyl]c clohexyl methyl]- exahydro-4,7-methano-2H-isoindole-1,3-dione hydrochloride (Figure 1), and it belongs to the second generation of the antipsychotic family [5]. The benzisothiazole ring is responsible for in ibiting activity over the D2 and 5-HT2A receptors by hydroge bonding and aromatic inter ction [6]. Another pharmacophore corresponds to a positive ionizable piperazi e group and 2H- oind le-1,3-dione by hydrogen-bonding acceptor groups [6]. This last ring is pro e t alkaline hydrolys s, which is the main mechanism of the drug\u2019s degradation. Moreover, due to the pr sence of sulfur in the benzothiazole r ng, LRD undergoes oxidation to f rm s lfone and ulfoxide. Howev r, the oxidative mechanism less relevant than alkalin hydrolysis and requires mo e extreme conditions, such as 10% hydr gen peroxide. was found to be stable under thermal stress, neutral hydrolysis, acid hydrolysis, and photolytic stress [7].\nFigure 1. Chemical structure of LRD.\nThe drug presents polymorphism and has been described in several crystalline forms and as an amorphous solid [8,9]. This phenomenon has huge impact on the bioavailability, processability, and stability of solid pharmaceutical forms [10]. LRD\u2019s pharmaceutical presentations include tablets of 20, 40, 80, and 120 mg, where 40 and 80 mg per day are the recommended doses [1]. LRD\u2019s absorption is between 9 and 19%, and its Tmax ranges are between 1.5 and 3 h after a single and double dose, respectively [11]. It is eliminated through the feces and urine, accounting for 80 and 9.0%, respectively [12]. While its BCS class has not been reported, it has been suggested that LRD could be a class II drug due to its low aqueous solubility and its high partition coefficient [13]. There are several procedures to increase drug solubility, among which the most commonly used for class II and IV drugs are particle size reduction [14], preparation of solid dispersions [15], crystalline state modification [16], and formation of inclusion complexes with cyclodextrins [17], among others. The cyclodextrins enable the production of the drugs in different pharmaceutical forms, including solids and liquids [18]. The latter case is attractive for LRD, because liquids can be delivered by using a syringe,\nFigure 1.

The cyclodextrins enable the production of the drugs in different pharmaceutical forms, including solids and liquids [18]. The latter case is attractive for LRD, because liquids can be delivered by using a syringe, measuring cup, or spoon for dosing adjustment (20 mg to 160 mg) for different patients (e.g., pediatric, adolescents, or adults), diagnoses (e.g., schizophrenia or bipolar I disorder), or situations such as renal or hepatic impairment [19], thereby facilitating its administration. As a drug delivery system, cyclodextrins offer several advantages: They can be included in liquid, semi-solid, and solid systems [20,21]; these can control drug release [22].\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 232 3 of 27\nThey can be adapted to different routes of administration, e.g., oral, parenteral, ocular, nasal, dermal, oromucosal, etc. [23]; these can be included in modern drug delivery systems, such as microparticles, liposomes, nanoparticles, etc. [24]. Smart hybrid systems can be developed that are capable of improving the disposition of drugs in the therapeutic target by various mechanisms (e.g., pH, temperature, redox, enzymes, etc.) [25,26]. Cyclodextrins are cyclic oligosaccharides formed by 6\u20138 glucopyranose units, bonded by an \u03b1-1\u20134 glycosidic bond [27]. This macrocycle adopts a spatial disposition that provides a hydrophobic cavity and a hydrophilic outer surface responsible for its aqueous solubility [18]. The primary and secondary hydroxyls on the large and small edges of the macrocycle are able to favorably interact with water molecules. However, the main feature of cyclodextrins is given by the non-polar character of the central cavity, which enables binding of hydrophobic molecules such as drugs, where the water displacement is thermodynamically favored because of their low interaction strength with the inside of the macrocycle [28]. Normally, the nature of the host\u2013guest interactions involves charge transfer, electrostatic interaction, dispersion forces (Van der Waals), hydrogen bonds, and conformational release of tension [29\u201331]. Another interesting property of the host\u2013guest chemistry of cyclodextrins includes their ability to form complexes of different ratios [32]. These properties have attracted the attention of the pharmaceutical industry, where they have been incorporated as excipients [33]. Their main advantages are their high stability under light, heat, and oxidation, their biocompatibility, the reduction in irritant effects on tissues caused by some drugs, and the decrease in flavor and smell, improving the organoleptic properties of drugs. Among the types of cyclodextrins, beta-cyclodextrin (BCD) is the most widely used because its size allows it to properly host several sizes of molecules, together with its lack of toxicity when orally administered. However, it has low gastrointestinal absorption compared to other cyclodextrin derivatives, and it may cause renal toxicity when it is administered by the parenteral route [17]. Hydroxypropyl-\u03b2-cyclodextrin (HPBCD), obtained by the hydroxylation of BCD, is a derivative that has shown lower toxicity [34] and higher solubility [35], making it an excellent candidate to improve the solubility of lipophilic drugs, for which it is necessary to administer high doses in order to achieve a pharmacological response. For example, insoluble itraconazole (BCS II class) was formulated by forming a complex with an HPBCD, thereby obtaining the oral liquid medication known as SPORANOX\u00ae [17,36]. In the case of LRD, a patent describes the preparation of complexes with HPBCD or sulfobutylether-\u03b2-cyclodextrin for oral or injection formulations by spray-drying and lyophilization methods; however, there is a lack of information supporting the encapsulation process, such as physicochemical characterization and loading [37]. Londhe et al. [38] prepared BCD\u2013LRD complexes by kneaded solid dispersion and spray-dried solid dispersion with 1:1 host\u2013guest ratios. Other strategies employed to improve LRD\u2019s solubility include nanosuspensions [13], co-amorphous complexes [39\u201341], hydrotrope formation [42], and nanoemulsions [43]. Herein, we present the formation of a higher-order complex between HPBCD and LRD by the slurry complexation method, by which we improved the solubility and stability of the drug. This is accompanied by a complete experimental characterization of the host\u2013guest interactions."

There, the best-suited HPBCD was selected according to its ability to reproduce NMR experimental observations, and this HPBCD was used in this study. The LRD ligand was built using Avogadro v1.2.0 software [47], and a geometric optimization followed by a conformational search was carried out using the metadynamics approach as implemented in the x-TB v6.5.1 software [48], through the crest module [49,50]. The lowest energy conformation together with the BCD and HPBCD systems was refined through the use of density functional theory (DFT) calculations. For this purpose, the BP86 [51,52] exchange\u2013correlation functional was used because of the compromise between accuracy and efficiency, complemented by the use of the resolution of identity approximation to increase the computational efficiency due to the size of the systems [53,54]. The def2-SVP basis set was used for all of the atoms [55]. All DFT calculations included the dispersion correction developed by Grimme with the damping function to correct for close interactions [56\u201359]. The refined geometries were used as the starting coordinates for the docking studies. The docking calculations were performed using the AutoDock4 software [60] by means of the Lamarckian genetic algorithm as a search method, as implemented in the program. Each docking run consisted of 100 runs, with the maximum number of evaluations set to 25,000,000 and a maximum number of generations up to 27,000. From the results, we selected the lowest-energy solution to obtain a starting complex. We first proceeded by docking the LRD in its deprotonated form into the BCD and HPBCD hosts, from which we\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 232 7 of 27\nwere able to select one final conformation. Then, for the addition of a second cyclodextrin for the LRD\u2013BCD and LRD\u2013HPBCD complexes, the best solution for each complex was docked with a BCD and an HPBCD as a ligand, respectively. Then, the same procedure was followed using LRD in its protonated form (LRDH) for comparison purposes."

First, we conducted a conformational search using the complexes as starting coordinates by means of the metadynamics approach available on x-TB. We found three low-energy solutions that characterized the three possible binding modes of the deprotonated form of LRD for the following complexes: LRD\u2013BCD, LRD\u2013HPBCD, BCD\u2013 LRD\u2013BCD, and HPBCD\u2013LRD\u2013HPBCD. These were optimized by using DFT calculations at the same level of theory used for the refinement of the ligands, namely, the DFT/BP86/def2SVP methodology. Once the DFT-optimized geometries were obtained, the solvation effects were studied by using the implicit solvation model known as COSMO [61]. Meanwhile, for the protonated form of LRDH, we generally found two distinguishable binding modes with the lowest interaction energies, although only one was found for the HPBCD\u2013LRDH\u2013 HPBCD complex. All interaction energies for the first and second inclusion processes were calculated according to the following expression:\nEint = [LRD-cyclodextrin] \u2212 [LRD + cyclodextrin] and for the second inclusion process:\nEint = [cyclodextrin-LRD-cyclodextrin] \u2212 [LRD-cyclodextrin + cyclodextrin] where, in order to calculate the interaction energies using the protonated form of the\nligand, LRD is replaced by LRDH in the equations. Finally, we calculated the IR spectra of the complex with the lowest interaction energy to compare and properly characterize the experimental results. The interaction energies were decomposed into physical contributions through the second-generation energy decomposition analysis based on absolutely localized molecular orbitals (ALMO-EDA) [62\u201364], using the Q-Chem 5.2 software [65,66]. According to this approach, each interaction energy is decomposed into six terms:\n\u2206Eint = \u2206ECT + \u2206EPOL + \u2206EDISP + \u2206EELEC + \u2206EPAULI\nwhere \u2206EELEC incorporates the stabilization due to the coulombic electrostatic interactions between the frozen fragment charge distributions. \u2206EPOL describes the stabilization due to the intramolecular density relaxation caused by the perturbation induced by the presence of the opposite fragment in the complex. \u2206ECT is the charge-transfer term that accounts for the energy lowering due to the intermolecular charge transfer between fragments caused by orbital interactions; it also includes the intramolecular density relaxation induced by the charge transfer. \u2206EDISP represents the contributions coming from the dispersion forces, which are very important in the host\u2013guest context. Finally, \u2206EPAULI corresponds to the electronic repulsion due to the interaction between electrons of the same spin, which can also be interpreted as electronic steric repulsion due to volume-exclusion effects when two fragments are compressed."

            "text": "To obtain a clearer picture of th possible binding mod s and stabilities of LRD in this type of host, we proceeded by obtaining complexes using both BCD and HPBCD for comparative purposes, aiming to shed light on the advantages of the use of HPBCD with respect to BCD. The results associated with the interaction energies (\u2206Eint), the interaction energies corrected by solvent (\u2206Eint-S), and the dipolar moments (\u00b5) are listed in Table 8 and Table S1. For the first inclusion process, we found a clear dependence of the protonation state of LRD and of the type of host. For the first inclusion process, the LRD\u2013HPBCD complex showed an increase of 14.7 kcal/mol in stability with respect to the BCD counterpart. Meanwhile, the transition from the deprotonated to the protonated LRDH involved an increase of 81.5 kcal/mol, indicating that this would be the preferred state for the ligand when binding to the host. The geometries of the inclusion complexes selected within this study are shown in Figure 10, Figure 11, Figure S10 and Figure S11. In terms of the binding mode for the first inclusion process, in all cases\u2014namely, BCD, HPBCD, LRD, and LRDH\u2014the benzisothiazol ring was always located outside the cyclodextrine through the larger opening, also known as a secondary rim. According to this, we found three possible variations in the binding mode: the first involved the inclusion of the cyclohexylmethyl with the isoindole-1,3-dione moieties, corresponding to the complex\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 232 18 of 27\nwith the lowest interaction energy with LRD and the highest stability; the second involved the inclusion of the piperazin with the cyclohexylmethyl, partially leaving out the aliphatic part of the isoindole-1,3-dione; finally, the third involved the full inclusion of the isoindole1,3-dione, leaving the rest outside the secondary rim. Meanwhile, the inclusion process of LRDH was well characterized by two binding modes in both BCD and HPBCD. The first, and the most stable, involved the inclusion of the cyclohexylmethyl moiety, leaving both ends of the LRDH molecule outside, whereas the second binding mode was characterized by the inclusion of the isoindole-1,3-dione. The main difference between the complexes formed by BCD and HPBCD was the fact that, with HPBCD, one of the oxygens from the isoindole-1,3-dione from LRD in both protonation states always formed a hydrogen bond with a hydroxyl group from the side chains of HPBCD, which was absent in all complexes with BCD.\nFor the second inclusion process to reach a stoichiometry of 1:2, there was a clear increase in the interaction energies, which was more marked for the BCD complexes, which for LRD increased by 51.0 kcal/mol after the addition of the second host, while for LRDH the increase was 38.8 kcal/mol. For the case of HPBCD, the addition of the second host to the LRD\u2013HPBCD complex increased the interaction energy by 33.0 kcal/mol, and with LRDH the increase was 22.1 kcal/mol. Despite these observations, in general terms, the total stability denoted by the magnitude of the interaction energy was always higher for the HPBCD complexes. The binding modes were characterized by an extended conformation of LRD and LRDH for the lowest-energy conformations with BCD and HPBCD. In all cases, it seemed that the titratable nitrogen from the piperazin ring was always located at the interphase between the cyclodextrins, in both LRD and LRDH. The differences observed in the interaction energies for the second inclusion process using LRD and BCD were mostly associated with the proper interaction between the two cyclodextrins. While the lowest-energy conformer showed an ordered conformation, BCD-C2 and BCD-C3 from Figure S11 showed a more disordered interaction and conformation between the BCDs. When the ligand was protonated, the decrease in the interaction energy was due to an attempt to reach a folded conformation of LRDH inside the BCD\u2013BCD cavity because of an intramolecular hydrogen bond between the isoindole-1,3-dione and the proton from the piperazin ring. However, this conformation is not favored, as it causes a decrease of 53.8 kcal/mol in the interaction energy, indicating that the extended conformation of the ligand is favored for the 1:2 stoichiometry, independent of its protonation state. The same behavior was observed for HPBCD, where a more ordered interaction interphase between the cyclodextrins led to lower interaction energies of LRD and HPBCD\u2013HPBCD in both protonation states, always favoring the extended conformation of the ligand. Interestingly, for both BCD\u2013BCD and\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 232 19 of 27\nHPBCD\u2013HPBCD when in complex with LRD, no hydrogen bonds were formed, opposite to what was observed at a 1:1 stoichiometry with HPBCD. Only for the protonated form (LRDH) did the proton from the piperazin ring form a hydrogen bond with one of the hydroxyl groups from one of the cyclodextrins for both BCD and HPBCD. For all of the cases studied here, the incorporation of the solvent effect caused a decrease in the interaction energies. The reason for this behavior comes from the increase in the stabilization of the cyclodextrin ligand, which is higher than the stabilization observed for the complex and, consequently, causes a decrease in the interaction energy. Experimentally, this destabilizing effect would be analogous to the work required for the desolvation process necessary to incorporate the ligand inside the cyclodextrin. From a qualitative point of view, the increase in the dipolar moment (\u00b5) of the complex with respect to the \u00b5 from the ligand reflects the increase in its solubility in water. As shown in Table 7, if we consider the \u00b5 of LRDH as a reference, which is 8.15 D, we could suggest that the increase in solubility is mainly associated with the first inclusion process.\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 19 of 29\nTable 8.

According to the stabilizing contributions, it was noticeable that the interaction was mainly dominated by electrostatic effects, whose contribution was always close to 50%, followed by the dispersion interaction contribution, which ranged between 29 and 38% depending on the complex. The charge transfer contribution due to orbital\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 232 20 of 27\ninteractions was low, as expected, as there was no formal covalent interaction. Finally, the polarization contribution was the lowest contribution, indicating minor effects on the electronic density redistribution after complex formation in both the cyclodextrins and the ligands from an intramolecular point of view. The destabilizing effects reflected by the Pauli repulsion partially indicated the steric electronic effects between electrons of the same spin, which were high due to the proximity between the ligand and the host, which was higher for the models representing the 1:2 stoichiometry, as expected. Nevertheless, this destabilizing effect was overcompensated by the stabilizing contributions previously mentioned, leading to the formation of complexes of high stability.

For this, we focused on the complexes with HPBCD with the deprotonated and protonated ligands. After proper identification of the bands associated with the normal vibrational modes on which we focused our study, the results showed that the energies calculated for the bands of the free LRDH were overestimated; however, after being complexed with HPBCD in its protonated form, the energies became closer to the experimental results. This reflects that the free LRDH does not properly represent the experimental vibrational modes of the same system, as it is in a saline form as LRD-HCl surrounded by images of itself in the experimental matrix.

For this, we focused on the complexes with HPBCD with the deprotonated and protonated ligands. After proper identification of the bands associated with the normal vibrational modes on which we focused our study, the results showed that the energies calculated for the bands of the free LRDH were overestimated; however, after being complexed with HPBCD in its protonated form, the energies became closer to the experimental results. This reflects that the free LRDH does not properly represent the experimental vibrational modes of the same system, as it is in a saline form as LRD-HCl surrounded by images of itself in the experimental matrix. However, after the complex of LRDH with PBCD was formed, the Cl\u2212 anion seemed to be left out of the system, and the energy bands then properly reproduced the experimental behavior.\nTable 9.

The comparison of the behavior observed when increasing the stoichiometry from 1:1 and 1:2 between the experimental and the calculated energy bands of the LRDH\u2013HPBCD complexes with the protonated ligand revealed semi-quantitative agreement between the experimental results and the calculations, thereby validating the models obtained. Even though in the experimental spectra the changes were only minor, these were correctly represented by the models. For the symmetric stretching, the experimental shift was from 1762.0 cm\u22121 to 1767.0 cm\u22121, while the calculated shift was from 1789.6 cm\u22121 to 1801.1 cm\u22121. For the antisymmetric stretching, the experimental energy bands shifted from 1688.0 cm\u22121 to 1691.0 cm\u22121, while the model shifted from 1713.7 cm\u22121 to 1728.7 cm\u22121. In addition, the same qualitative decrease in the intensity band observed experimentally was reproduced by the models. Regarding N-H, the main change expected for this band was a decrease in its intensity, which was observed in the models, where the intensity of the N-H stretching decreased from 329.7 to 281.5. However, this phenomenon was not observed in the experimental spectra, due to overlapping of the OH groups (stretching band) of the LRD\u2013HPBCD complex."

            "text": "The formation of inclusion complexes through host\u2013guest supramolecular chemistry depends on the inherent characteristics of the drug to be encapsulated and the host cavity. More than one molecule can enter a cavity if the drug is of sufficiently small molecular weight, as in the case of pyrene [77]. In general, most of the chemical entities can form 1:1 relationships with cyclodextrins; however, the possibility of forming higher-order complexes with two and three guest units has been presented where, in addition to size, the functionalities present in the drugs can influence the encapsulation process [78]. For LRD, the formation of a 1:1 complex with BCD was described, which was interpreted in terms of the phase solubility diagram. Nonetheless, the limited solubility of this cyclodextrin does not allow the observation of other relationships that occur at higher concentrations [79]. According to the NMR analysis, the 1:1 interaction was interpreted to occur through the aromatic ring, with downfield shifts depending on the manufacturing procedure, with \u2206\u03b4 (ppm) values between 0.00050 and 0.0268. HPBCD has an aqueous solubility of >600 mg/mL [17] and, in our case, at high concentrations of this agent, a positive deviation of the phase solubility graph was observed, suggesting the formation of a higher-order complex. A downfield shift was observed in the NMR of the aromatic protons, with a \u2206\u03b4 (ppm) = 0.005 between the complexes and LRD, similar to that described with BCD, as well as in the isoindole-1,3-dione ring with \u2206\u03b4 (ppm) = 0.017. This last difference, which was not observed in the previous study [38], implies the interaction of this group with HPBCD\u2014possibly through hydrogen bonds\u2014due to the presence of the hydroxyl substituent in this cyclodextrin. This was also observed by the shift of the carbonyl infrared bands of that ring from 1762/1688 cm\u22121 to 1769/1696 cm\u22121 in the 1:3 complex. In addition, a significant upward shift was observed from the salt and the alkyl proton, with \u2206\u03b4 = \u22120.678, \u22120.082, and \u22120.010, which was also not described for BCD, reinforcing the hypothesis of the interaction of more than one ring in the formation of the higher-order complex with HPBCD. The computational models obtained confirm the stability of the complex formed between LRD and HPBCD, and also support the possibility of an energetically favored 1:2 ratio. The nature of the solid state plays an important role in the solubility of drugs, with crystalline drugs generally having less solubility than those in an amorphous state [10]. Several patents describe the preparation of amorphous LRD [67,80], with slight improvements in its solubility relative to crystalline forms [9]; however, in general, this type of solid presents stability problems. Qian et al. reported an increase in the solubility of a synthesized amorphous LRD relative to the crystalline form; however, in saturated solutions, the initial increase decayed over time, and in 10 h it equaled the crystalline solubility [39]. The\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 232 23 of 27\nsame authors developed a complex of saccharin and LRD that showed a greater intrinsic solubility of the drug through the formation of a co-amorphous solid whose supersaturated solutions were maintained for 24 h. The stability study showed that the amorphous form synthesized after two days showed signs of crystallinity, while the saccharin\u2013LRD complex maintained its amorphous nature for 60 days. Charge-assisted hydrogen bonding interaction between the N+-H group of LRD and the C=O group in saccharin was identified as being responsible for the improvements in the drug properties. In our case, with 1:2 and 1:3 ratios of LRD\u2013HPBCD, solids with amorphous characteristics were obtained, which would imply that, in addition to aromatic interactions, other supramolecular bonds would be involved in drug stabilization, such as hydrogen bonds between the isoindole-1,3-dione ring and HPBCD, as suggested by NMR and infrared analyses. This made it possible to significantly improve the solubility of the drug, reaching values of up to 20 mg/mL for the complex with a 1:3 ratio. In addition to the physical changes that an amorphous solid may undergo over time, it is important to evaluate the intrinsic stability of the drug in pre-formulation studies and how different excipients influence it [10]. The main instability of LRD is due to the hydrolysis of the isoindole-1,3-dione ring and in our study we found that encapsulation with HPBCD is an effective method to avoid this degradation route. In other studies, only the physical stability of co-amorphous complexes has been evaluated [40,41], without indicating information on chemical stability, and in both cases the interaction did not involve the isoindole-1,3-dione ring, leaving it susceptible to hydrolytic degradation. With respect to accelerated stability studies, the LRD\u2013puerarin complex was stable for 50 days at 40 \u25e6C and 75% relative humidity, with a small decrease in titer that was not significant [40]. In our case, the complexes with 1:2 and 1:3 ratios remained stable for 90 days under the same conditions, and the positive variations could be attributed to product uniformity or analytical deviation. Complexes with cyclodextrins have proven to be useful for preparing pharmaceutical solutions for poorly soluble drugs [69]. This represents a challenge because these formulations have several excipients, such as cosolvents, sweeteners, and flavoring agents, which can influence the complexation process. For example, propylene glycol, which is used as a cosolvent at a percentage of 10% v/v, competes in the formation of the 1:2 itraconazole\u2013 HPBCD complex, reducing its affinity [81]. For this API with the same excipient, it has also been shown that the manufacturing method can have an influence, where the separate dissolution procedure increases the solubility of itraconazole more than the classic method (all components together) [82]. In another case, the use of a surfactant (poloxamer 188) also improved the solubility of a classical complex between genistein and HPBCD, through the formation of a ternary mixture [83]. Therefore, it is necessary to evaluate the influence of different excipients and the manufacturing method of the LRD\u2013HPBCD complex to obtain a suitable liquid dosage form."

            "text": "Cyclodextrins are excipients that are widely used to improve the solubility of poorly soluble drugs, through the formation of inclusion complexes. Herein, we conclude that the LRD\u2013HPBCD complex significantly increases the solubility of the guest molecule when a 1:2 or 1:3 ratio is used. Higher-order complexes also improve drug stability under alkaline and oxidative degradation and under accelerated conditions. LRD medication requires dose adjustments depending on the type of patient; therefore, the increase in solubility could allow the preparation of an oral liquid pharmaceutical form that fulfills this purpose. Additionally, the preparation of a solid through a simple slurry method allows a formulation with higher dissolution that could improve the low bioavailability of this drug or the formulation of a parenteral powder for injectable reconstitution with improved stability. New compatibility and stability studies will be necessary for this purpose.\nPharmaceutics 2023, 15, 232 24 of 27\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/pharmaceutics15010232/s1, Figure S1: 1H-1H correlation spectroscopy experiment of LRD; Figure S2: Infrared spectrum of LRD; Figure S3: Mass spectrum of LRD; Figure S4: Powder X-ray diffraction of LRD; Figure S5: Particle size distribution of LRD; Figure S6: HPLC purity of LRD; Figure S7: Chromatogram of the detection limit; Figure S8: Chromatograms of the LRD degradation in the evaluation of the specificity of the method; Figure S9: Infrared spectroscopy analysis of LRD\u2013HPBCD complexes at 3 months accelerated stability; Figure S10: Graphical representation of the rest of the binding conformations found for the inclusion complexes for LRD and LRDH in BCD and HPBCD for the first inclusion process (1:1); Figure S11: Graphical representation of the geometries representing the rest of the binding conformations found for the inclusion complexes for LRD and LRDH in BCD and HPBCD for the second inclusion process (1:2); Table S1: Interaction energies (\u2206Eint), interaction energy corrected by implicit solvent (\u2206Eint-S), solvent destabilization contribution (Solv), dispersion interaction energy contribution (Edisp), and dipolar moments (\u00b5) for the complex formation between lurasidone and BCD or HPBCD in a (1:1) and (1:2) stoichiometry.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.E.G.-A. and S.M.-R.; methodology, M.E.G.-A., A.G. and N.C.; software, M.E.G.-A., A.G. and S.M.-R.; validation, J.O.M., J.E.G.C. and D.M.R.G.; formal analysis, M.E.G.-A., S.M.-R. and A.G.; investigation, M.E.G.-A., N.C. and A.G; resources, M.E.G.-A., S.M.-R. and J.O.M.; data curation, M.E.G.-A. and S.M.-R..; writing\u2014original draft preparation, M.E.G.-A. and S.M.-R.; writing\u2014review and editing, M.E.G.-A., S.M.-R. and J.O.M.; visualization, J.O.M., J.E.G.C. and D.M.R.G.; supervision, S.M.-R.; project administration, S.M.-R.; funding acquisition, S.M.-R. and J.O.M.
