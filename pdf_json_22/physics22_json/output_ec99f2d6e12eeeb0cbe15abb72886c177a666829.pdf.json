    "abstractText": "Rapidly increasing political polarization threatens democracies around the world. Scholars from several disciplines are assessing and modeling polarization antecedents, processes, and consequences. Social systems are complex and networked. Their constant shifting hinders attempts to trace causes of observed trends, predict their consequences, or mitigate them. We propose an equivalent-neighbor model of polarization dynamics. Using statistical physics techniques, we generate anticipatory scenarios and examine whether leadership and/or external events alleviate or exacerbate polarization. We consider three highly polarized USA groups: Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. We assume that in each group, each individual has a political stance s ranging between left and right. We quantify the noise in this system as a \u201csocial temperature\u201d T. Using energy E, we describe individuals\u2019 interactions in time within their own group and with individuals of the other groups. It depends on the stance s as well as on three intra-group and six inter-group coupling parameters. We compute the probability distributions of stances at any time using the Boltzmann probability weight exp(\u2212E/T). We generate average group-stance scenarios in time and explore whether concerted interventions or unexpected shocks can alter them. The results inform on the perils of continuing the current polarization trends, as well as on possibilities of changing course.",

According to [2], polarization results from individuals forming \u201cbroad and encompassing clusters organized around cohesive packages of beliefs\u201d. Political polarization\u2014\u201cthe increasing ideological distance between the left and the right\u201d [3]\u2014is accompanied by affective polarization, which is a dislike and distrust of individuals belonging to the opposing political party [4]. This further reduces inter-group exchanges and enhances homophily, defined as \u201ca greater interaction between like-minded individuals\u201d, which can itself be a source of polarization [5,6]. The United States is increasingly and sharply polarizing politically ([7\u201312]; Figure 1) but is not alone in this [13] and, according to polls, people see it [10]. This trend in the American public began in the 1970s [14]. It is mirrored by media polarization, with each side only trusting the media favoring their own side [15]. The political differences tend to revolve around a set of issues including government aid to the needy, race, immigration, national security, and the environment [7]. Political polarization has serious societal [1,16\u201318] and economic [3] consequences. It harms democracies [16\u201318].

While, in general, interactions between people might be expected to reduce their differences [19], lack of inter-group interactions (homophily) deepens differences to the detriment of society. Polarization fosters a Manichaean (good\u2013bad) outlook on issues, with no gray areas and no attention to the complexity of reality [18], and increases the likelihood of social conflict [19]. One casualty of polarization is truth: polarized individuals expect scientific information to align with their political perspective, regardless of its factual basis [18,20,21]. Another downside of polarization is that needed change can no longer occur through debate, give-and-take, and joint decisions, and instead tends to occur by fiat when one side accumulates sufficient power to impose it, only to be undone when the other side takes a turn in power [18]. Given the socially destructive consequences of polarization, we need to anticipate its possible direction and magnitude in time, and explore interventions.

Since prediction in the context of a complex system is at best limited [25], generating qualitative anticipatory scenarios that can be queried e.g., [40\u201345] is an alternative. This entails producing a range of possible futures with respect to a variable of interest, mapping their consequences, and exploring intervention possibilities. The general mean-field approach has gained currency in the first decades of the century as scholars applied it to a variety of contexts. For example, using mean-field models, we anticipated election outcomes in the US and in Bosnia\u2013Hercegovina [28,42], and various labor-management contract negotiations results [45]. As [46] argued, anticipatory scenarios are useful in supporting the development of robust strategies of action in the face of high levels of uncertainty in characterizing complex systems. We take this approach in anticipating the course of political polarization in the United States. We propose a three-group model to represent Democrats, Republicans, and Independents. Informed by public-poll results, we qualitatively estimate the model\u2019s parameters and reproduce the polarization pattern in time, as reflected in the polls. We explore effects of leadership and of a focusing event on the polarization trends. We find that leadership has a transitory effect in reducing polarization, while a focusing effect has the potential for a more lasting impact in bringing people together, but it cannot be controlled."

            "text": "We extended a sociophysics two-group mean-field model of conflict dynamics [40] to three political groups in the US: Democrats (group 1), Republicans (group 2), and Independents (group 3). Groups 1 and 2 drive the polarization, often measured as the average gap between them. Group 3 matters, however, because, considering 2004 Independents have represented between 27% and 50% of the population [47], they are recruitment pools for the other two groups and gain importance especially at election times. We considered each group to be a network of individuals, with each vertex connected to all others with bonds of equal intensity [40,42]. The couplings do not depend on the distance between individuals. This is an equivalent-neighbor or mean-field model. In each group, each individual has a stance si regarding a specific issue under debate, i.e., economics, social issues, defense, etc., or (as described here) a package of such issues (in the [1,6] sense). The stance si varies between \u22121 and +1, where \u22121 corresponds to the Democrats/progressive/left position, while +1 corresponds to the Republicans/conservative/right position. Individuals align with the group whose average stance is closest to their own [1]. Individuals inside a group are homophilic [5], i.e., they tend to prefer to communicate with each other rather than with individuals from a different group. We note that in our previous work on two- and three-group conflicts [40\u201343], the stance si was discrete. Here, the stances si are continuous, which we believe is more realistic and eliminates the arbitrariness of selecting a discrete number of states. We computed the average stance s of each group using the Boltzmann probability distribution exp(\u2212E/T). The negative energy associated with an individual in group 1 is \u2212Ei = Jsis1+ Hsi, where si is the stance of that individual and s1 is the mean of all stances in group 1. The coupling J quantifies the cohesiveness of the group. The magnetic field H represents the (possible) action of the group\u2019s leadership on the individuals: for H > 0, the mean stance is pushed to positive values, while for H < 0, the mean stance is pushed to negative values. For group 1:\ns1t+1 =\n\u222b 1 \u22121 se\n\u2212 Js1ts+HsT ds\u222b 1 \u22121 e \u2212 Js1ts+HsT ds (1)\nEntropy 2022, 24, 1262 4 of 10\nWe denote j = J/T, h = H/T. The result of the integration (1) can then be expressed with the Langevin function (which is used to model paramagnetic materials):\nL(x) = cotanh(x)\u2212 1/x (2)\nThen, Equation (1) becomes\ns1t+1 = L(js1t + h) (3)\nThe average stance s at time t+1 is assumed to be determined by preferences of the group at an earlier time t. This lag represents the time it takes to change individuals\u2019 stance, for instance, by peers\u2019 persuasion. The time t is expressed in units of the lag time. Within each group, members try to persuade each other to their own stance, thereby reducing the intra-group stance differences. They also take account of the other groups\u2019 average attitudes. In time, average group attitudes evolve depending on the values of intra-group cohesion parameters J and the inter-group influence parameters K. For example, that is how Democrats and Republicans attract Independents into their respective groups since their internal cohesion J3 is nil, i.e., they are not a formal group. In the presence of two other groups, we assumed that the energy function L of group 1 contains two added interaction terms, i.e., K12s2t + K13s3t, representing the influence of the mean stances of groups 2 and 3, respectively, on an individual i in group 1. Thus, for each of the three groups,\ns1t+1 = L(h1 + j1s1t + k12s2t + k13s3t)\ns2t+1 = L(h2 + j2s2t + k21s1t + k23s3t)\ns3t+1 = L(h3 + j3s3t + k31s1t + k32s3t)\n(4)\nHere, h1 represents H1/T, k12 represents K12/T, etc. The inter-group interactions K12 and K21 are not necessarily equal. At times, members of one group may feel cooperative toward the other, who might not reciprocate. We define a polarization measure as the distance between the mean stances of groups 1 and 2 at any time:\nP = (s2 \u2212 s1)/2 (5)\nIt is defined so that \u22121 \u2264 P \u2264 1. The unpolarized case P = 0 corresponds to equal stances, i.e., s1 = s2. Polarization is extreme when P = 1, corresponding to the Republicans\u2019 stance s2 = 1 (conservative/right) and Democrats\u2019 stance s1 = \u22121 (progressive/left), and when P =\u22121, corresponding to the Republicans\u2019 stance s2 =\u22121 and Democrats\u2019 stance s1 = 1. The model has twelve parameters: three for the groups\u2019 respective internal cohesiveness J, six representing how they relate to each other, K, and three H. They can be estimated qualitatively, as we have done here, informed by publicly available poll data (here, we used [7,41,48])."

We distinguished three qualitatively different situations depending on K12 and K21, which are the interactions between groups 1 and 2. Scenario A is competitive in that K12 < 0 and K21\nEntropy 2022, 24, 1262 5 of 10\n< 0 (Democrats and Republicans are contrarian).

            "text": "Our results are both methodological and substantive. Methodologically, we anticipated the progression of polarization using a sociophysics\nmean-field model. Anticipating a range of possible futures is useful and necessary for policy makers; they need to make robust decisions likely to work for the range rather than rely on one predicted future that may not materialize. We have illustrated how to generate qualitative anticipatory scenarios informed by publicly available poll data. We also showed that these scenarios are not sensitive to small parameter changes (Figure 7). We have shown how we can query the original scenario (Figure 2) for effects of leadership (Figure 3) and focusing events (Figure 6). We plan to further enhance this model by adding to the number of interacting groups and by relaxing the current assumption that each individual interacts with every other individual in the system; for example, interactions could go through central figures or leaders. We also plan to explore changes in the intergroup parameters in time. Substantively, the first scenario we obtained (Figure 2) based on our assumptions is similar to the Pew poll results of 1994\u20132017 ([7]; Figure 1). According to [52], the ability to recreate patterns that match data (such as polls) is a measure of understanding the phenomenon we are studying using agent-based modeling; \u201cIf you didn\u2019t grow it, you didn\u2019t explain it\u201d [34]. We plan to improve the model in several ways. We will test the effect of K values for the Independents that create the \u201cleaning Democrat\u201d and \u201cleaning Republican\u201d subsets that exist in reality. We will also combine leadership and focusing events since leadership can make a considerable difference at times of crisis. We plan to explore the ways in which the intra- and inter-group parameters could change in time in reaction to internal group dynamics or external events. Since context plays an important role in real situations, we intend to explore its effects on polarization. Finally, we plan to examine scale effects e.g., [52] and explore the conjecture in [53] that the local convergence of stances can generate global polarization. We will investigate, using Monte Carlo simulations, the role of the range of interactions among the individuals of any given group."

            "text": "We have investigated political polarization, which is rising around the world and impeding polities from making necessary joint decisions. Numerous scholars are looking into its antecedents and its consequences. We are contributing a tool for gaining insights into future directions and into possible effects of intervention (e.g., through leadership), or under the effect of focusing events, e.g., natural disasters or wars. The tool we propose is a dynamic sociophysics model which has proven effective in addressing the complexity of social systems, as well as demonstrated to be versatile in its adaptability to several very different contexts, from political contests to regional economics, international disputes, and labor relations. While it is qualitative, it draws on publicly available data, such as opinion polls, and is relatively parsimonious in a number of parameters, especially considering the numerous variables likely affecting the phenomena studied. We used it, as illustrated in the case of polarization, to generate anticipatory scenarios that allow us to ask \u201cwhat if\u201d questions, such as \u201cwhat if\u201d a conciliatory leader emerged in one group, would polarization diminish? This practice is expanding in domains such as urban planning and business because it offers insights about a system that are difficult to gain by other approaches.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.K., S.K. and H.T.D.; methodology, M.K. and H.T.D.; software, M.K.; validation, M.K.; formal analysis, M.K. and S.K.; data curation, S.K.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, M.K. and S.K.; writing\u2014review and editing, S.K.
