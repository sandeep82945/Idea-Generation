    "abstractText": "One of the valuable fractions of paraffinic oils is the diesel fraction, which can be used as a commercial fuel. However, the high content of alkanes of normal structure (~10\u201340%) in the diesel fraction leads to a deterioration in the performance characteristics of the fuel and, as a result, the inability to use the diesel fraction without additional processing in the cold season at lower temperatures, which is critical for many regions with cold winters. The process of catalytic dewaxing is one of the most promising ways to improve the low-temperature characteristics of diesel fractions. This work is devoted to studying the activity of promoted Ni, Mo, and Ni-Mo catalysts based on mesoporous aluminosilicate and pre-activated bentonite in dewaxing diesel fractions. The effect of the nature and content of promoting additives on the activity of bifunctional catalysts in the process of hydroisodewaxing of diesel fraction in a flow-type reactor in the temperature range of 260\u2013340 \u25e6C, pressure of 2 MPa and feed space velocity of 1 h\u20131 was studied. It is shown that the synthesized bifunctional catalysts based on mesoporous aluminosilicate and pre-activated bentonite from the Tagan field (Ni/MAS-H-bentonite, Mo/MAS-H-bentonite, and Ni-Mo/MAS-H-bentonite) have the necessary balance of Lewis and Bronsted acid centers strengths. It allows them to selectively conduct the hydroisodewaxing process. It has been established that the use of the synthesized 5% Ni-1% Mo/MAS-H-bentonite bifunctional catalyst in the diesel fractions hydroisodewaxing process under optimal process conditions makes it possible to obtain diesel fuel with low-temperature characteristics that meet the requirements for cold climate fuels: cold filter plugging point (CFPP)\u2014minus 33 \u25e6C, flash point in a closed cup\u201439 \u25e6C and pour point\u2014minus 36 \u25e6C.",

            "text": "Diesel fuel is a yellow liquid viscous substance used in diesel engines. It is usually produced by distillation of oil and obtaining kerosene-gas oil fractions. The name \u201cdiesel fuel\u201d comes from the name of German engineer Rudolf Diesel. In 1892, Diesel applied for a patent for his invention: \u201ca new rational heat engine\u201d [1]. According to the Ministry of Energy of the Republic of Kazakhstan, diesel fuel consumption in 2023 is projected to be 5.8 million tons, compared with a production of 5.1 million tons. In 2022, this ratio was 5.6 and 5.3 million tons, respectively. However, the growth in consumption is not associated with the main sectors of the economy, such as the mining and metallurgical complex (MMC) and the railway, but is growing due to transit vehicles and \u201cgray\u201d exports to neighboring countries due to the cheap cost of fuel [2]. The\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7598. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28227598 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7598 2 of 20\nincreasing demand for diesel fuel consumption challenges scientists to improve processing and production, improve environmental performance, develop new technologies, and research aimed at more efficient and sustainable use of this type of fuel. However, the high content of normal alkanes (~10\u201340%) in the composition of the diesel fraction leads to a deterioration in the performance of the fuel and, as a result, the inability to use the diesel fraction without additional processing in the cold season, which is critical for many regions of Kazakhstan. Indicators such as pour point, freezing point, viscosity, and viscosity index are significantly improved when side chains are introduced along linear hydrocarbon chains [3,4]. Until the end of the 20th century, the main technological process that made it possible to reduce the pour point of raw materials was catalytic dewaxing, based mainly on hydrocracking reactions. However, lowering the pour point due to the selective hydrocracking of feedstock n-paraffins to light hydrocarbons leads to significant losses of the target product. Isodewaxing, in its turn, improves the low-temperature characteristics of crude oil. The process of isodewaxing is based on the hydroisomerization reactions of n-paraffins because the isoparaffins obtained in the course of the reaction remain in the composition of the target product [5]. Usually, the temperature of the hydroisomerization process varies from 280 to 350 \u25e6C, achieving a relatively high selectivity for the desired products [6]. Bifunctional catalysts are widely used for the hydroisomerization of n-alkanes. The presence of metal and acid sites in them makes it possible to provide the hydrogenation/ dehydrogenation function for the saturation/generation of alkene intermediates and the acidic function for skeletal rearrangement according to the carbenium ion mechanism [7\u20139]. The key to making this combination an excellent catalyst to achieve the aforementioned goal is the balance of acidic and metallic properties of the catalysts [10]. Catalytic systems of the isodeparaffinization process primarily utilize expensive metals such as platinum and palladium [11,12]. However, since these metals impart dehydrating properties to catalysts, they are not resistant to the toxic effects of contact poisons present in the diesel fraction. To address this issue, it is proposed to employ catalysts promoted by metals such as Ni and Mo; this is attributed to the fact that catalysts based on these metals exhibit high hydrogenating activity even in the presence of significant sulfur content in the raw material [13\u201315]. On the other hand, the use of this type of metal significantly reduces production costs and increases the volume of fuel produced. The choice of nickel, molybdenum, and the bimetallic Ni-Mo system as promoting components was due to the fact that nickel can compete with platinum- and palladium-based catalysts in its hydrogenation activity, as well as give catalysts dehydrogenating properties. At the same time, molybdenum demonstrates high resistance to poisoning by sulfur- and nitrogencontaining compounds [16,17]. The combination of nickel and molybdenum gives their mixture the ability to simultaneously carry out both homolytic and heterolytic reactions and gain resistance to the toxic effects of the sulfur and nitrogen compounds contained in petroleum feedstocks [18]. In this regard, the purpose of this work is to improve the performance characteristics of diesel fuels by hydrodewaxing in the presence of nickel-, molybdenum- and nickelmolybdenum-containing bifunctional catalysts based on mesoporous aluminosilicate and pre-activated bentonite. To achieve the goal of the work, bifunctional catalysts (Ni/MAS-H-bentonite, Mo/MASH-bentonite, and Ni-Mo/MAS-H-bentonite) were synthesized, their physicochemical characteristics and catalytic activity in the process of hydrodewaxing of diesel fractions were studied. The novelty of this work lies in the development of new catalysts based on mesoporous aluminosilicate and activated bentonite promoted by Ni and Mo metals for the dewaxing process of diesel fuel.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7598 3 of 20"

The authors studied and presented the physicochemical characteristics of mesoporous aluminosilicate and some catalysts [21].

Results and Discussion 2.1. Physicochemical Characteristics of Bifunctional Catalysts\nSynthesized mesoporous aluminosilicate (MAS) samples became one of the bifunctional composite support components and the bentonite of the Tagan field (East Kazakhstan region, Kazakhstan). The use of preliminarily activated bentonite as a second component for the catalyst support (MAS-H-bentonite) was conditioned by its accessibility, cheapness, developed specific surface area, durability, and thermal stability [19,20].\nThe authors studied and presented the physicochemical characteristics of mesoporous aluminosilicate and some catalysts [21]. In the current article, the additional results are pr sented.\nTexture characteristics are critical to the final catalytic properties of the synthesized catalysts.\nThe porous structure of the synthesized catalysts on the basis of mesoporous aluminosilica e is repr sented in Figures 1 nd 2 and Tabl 1.\nTable 1.

Synthesized catalysts pore sizes distribution.\nThe bifunctional catalyst isotherm pattern is similar to mesoporous aluminosilicates [18], indicating no carrier porosity damage after metal promotion. All obtained isotherms belong to the IV type of IUPAC classification, i.e., they have a more pronounced hysteresis loop closer to H4. They contain a hysteresis loop at relative pressures higher than P/P0 = 0.4, which is typical for mesoporous materials [22]. The presence of the hysteresis loop in the low-pressure range can be explained via capillary condensation in mesopores. The IVtype isotherms demonstrate a narrow pore size distribution in the 2\u201350 nm range. At the same time, the type H4 hysteresis is associated with tight slit-like pores [23]. The pore size distribution is presented in Figure 2 and was determined via the BJH method. According to the BJH analysis, the catalysts average pore size ranges from 1.67 to 3.8 nm. It was found that all samples show bimodal pore size distribution characteristics with maxima in the 2.9\u20136.9 nm range, which corresponds to mesopores. [24]. The specific surface area, pore volume, and average diameter of the synthesized materials are shown in Table 1. According to the data in Table 1, there was a decrease in the specific surface area and pore volume of the catalysts promoted by nickel and molybdenum compared to MAS-Hbentonite s specific surface area. Possibly, this is due to a partial block of the aluminosilicate pore system by the promoting additives. The specific surface area and the decrease in pore volume are the main indicators of metal attachment to carrier pores [25]. Further approvals of a final structure formation were obtained by measurements of X-ray diffraction on the promoted catalysts based on MAS and H-bentonite. An X-ray phase analysis of the supported nickel and molybdenum catalysts gives useful information about the presence or absence of Ni- and Mo-phases. X-ray diffraction patterns of the catalysts containing nickel and molybdenum in the 2\u03b8 range 10\u201390 are presented in Figure 3.\nFigure 2.

However, these samples differ in strength and concentration of acid sites. So, for instance, a sample of synthesized mesoporous aluminosilicate has approximately 98% weak acid sites (1144 \u00b5mol/g) and 2% medium-strength acid sites (27 \u00b5mol/g). Mixing the mesoporous aluminosilicate with the activated bentonite leads to a shift in the ammonia desorption peak towards lower temperatures. However, the area of the ammonia desorption curve becomes bigger.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7598 7 of 20\nThe data comparison in Figures 4 and 5 and Tables 2 and 3 shows that in contrast to the composite based on mesoporous aluminosilicate and H-bentonite, the thermal desorption curves of NH3 for the samples promoted with nickel and molybdenum have a different character. While the strength of acid sites increases, a decrease in their total concentration is also observed. Perhaps this is conditioned by blocking acid sites by the promoting additive. On the TPD\u2014NH3 curves of nickel-promoted samples, three thermal desorption peaks are observed with clearly defined maximums at low, medium, and high temperatures. The first low-temperature peak (Tmax = 180\u2013185 \u25e6C) is usually attributed to the desorption of ammonia adsorbed on the weak acid sites; the second peak (Tmax = 350\u2013365 \u25e6C) is usually attributed to the desorption of ammonia adsorbed on the medium acid sites [26\u201331]. The high-temperature peak above 500 \u25e6C corresponds to the strong acid sites. According to the data obtained and the thermal desorption of ammonia (Table 3), on the surface of the synthesized samples promoted with nickel, there are the weak acid centers\u201444\u201357%; the medium acid centers\u201435\u201341%; and only 7\u201318% can be attributed to the strong acid centers. The thermal desorption curves of the catalyst samples promoted with molybdenum, in contrast to the samples promoted with nickel, have two maximums at low and high temperatures and a shoulder at medium temperatures. The samples are mainly characterized by weak acid sites of 64\u201368%. An increase in the strength and number of acid sites on the carrier\u2019s surface with the introduction of a molybdenum source can be explained by an increase in the number of coordinately unsaturated Al3+ ions due to the tendency of Mo6+ ions to \u201cpull\u201d oxygen ions onto themselves [32]. It should be noted that with an increase in the content of both nickel and molybdenum in the catalyst, the total concentration of acid sites increased from 446 to 521 and from 620 to 684 \u25e6C, respectively; this happens mainly due to the strong acid sites and is tied up to the migration of nickel and molybdenum into the carrier channels and its interaction with the strong acid sites [33]. With the joint promotion of catalysts based on mesoporous aluminosilicate and preactivated bentonite, an increase in the concentration of low- and high-temperature acid sites is observed. Thus, from the TPD-NH3 results, it has been shown that the nature and content of promoting catalysts\u2019 additives affect the concentration and strength of the acid sites. The 5% Ni-1% Mo/MAS-H-bentonite sample has a greater number of acid sites available for the chemisorption of NH3 than the samples of catalysts promoted only by nickel and molybdenum. To determine the relative strength of Br\u00f8nsted and Lewis acid sites on the surface of mesoporous aluminosilicates and bifunctional catalysts based on them, the IR spectra of adsorbed pyridine samples were analyzed (Figure 6). The absorption bands are fixed at 1445\u20131447, 1490, and 1595 cm\u20131 on the studied samples, as in the case of mesoporous aluminosilicates. The absorption bands at 1445 and 1595 cm\u20131 are explained by the presence of hydrogen-bonded pyridine adsorbed on Lewis acid sites. A Strong Lewis bond is established with pyridine at 1445\u20131447 cm\u22121, and a weak Lewis bond is established with pyridine at 1595 cm\u22121 [34]. The band observed at about 1490 cm\u20131 is associated with the adsorption of pyridine on both Lewis and Br\u00f8nsted acid sites. The appearance of a band at 1550 cm\u22121 in the IR spectrum of Ni-Mo/MAS-Hbentonite catalyst is explained by the presence of hydrogen-bonded pyridine adsorbed on Br\u00f8nsted acid sites. It can be seen from the diffuse reflectance IR spectra that the NiMo/MAS-H-bentonite catalyst sample has stronger Lewis and Br\u00f8nsted sites and high acidity compared to monometallic catalysts, which matches well with the TPD-NH3 data. Thus, based on the data obtained, it can be argued that catalysts based on mesoporous aluminosilicate promoted with nickel and molybdenum differ in strength and concentration of acid sites. The strongest acid sites are characteristic of the catalyst sample based on mesoporous aluminosilicate promoted simultaneously with nickel and molybdenum ions.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7598 8 of 20\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 21 different character.

Curves of the temperature-programmed hydrogen reduction of bifunctional catalysts.\nOn the curves of the catalysts promoted with 1 wt.% nickel, six peaks are observed: 328, 472, 532, 683, 840, and 858 \u25e6C and a shoulder at 792 \u25e6C (Table 4). With the increase of nickel content in the catalyst, the low-temperature peak shifts toward higher temperatures. The peak at about 328 \u25e6C corresponds to the reduction of free NiO in the catalyst support [37,38]. This reduction peak corresponds to the reduction of NiO particles, which have minimal or no interaction with the support. The reduction peaks from 450 \u25e6C to about 800 \u25e6C may be due to the strong interaction between NiO and the catalyst support. The peak at 532 \u25e6C refers to the reduction of Ni2+ to NiO [39] and the reduction of nickel oxide monolayer particles on the catalyst surface [40,41]. High reduction temperatures (683 and 792 \u25e6C) may indicate NiAl2O4, a hard-to-recover spinel [42,43]. The nickel-promoted sample also had reduction peaks at 840 and 858 \u25e6C. These h gh reducti temperatures are associated with the reduction of Ni2+ to Ni interacting strongly with the alumina support due to the metal alloy effect [37,44].\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7598 10 of 20\nIn the case of the MAS-H-bentonite catalyst promoted with 1 wt.% Mo, four peaks were observed on the TPR curve: at 544, 658, 688, and 814 \u25e6C, and in the case of the sample promoted with 2 wt.% Mo, two peaks at 589 and 834 \u25e6C were observed.\nThe peak at 544 \u25e6C is conditioned by the reduction of polymeric octahedral forms of molybdenum Mo6+ \u2192 Mo4+ [45]. Other reduction peaks from 589 to 688 \u25e6C may be associated with the reduction of molybdenum oxide (Mo4+) to metallic molybdenum (Mo0) [25,46]. High-temperature peaks at 814 and 834 \u25e6C include a deep reduction of all forms of Mo, including highly dispersed tetrahedral forms of Mo [47]. Thus, both octahedral and tetrahedral forms of molybdenum coexist on the surface of a 2% Mo/MAS-H-bentonite catalyst, as observed in the IR spectra.\nIt is known [48] that MoO3 without support is reduced in two stages:\nMoO3 + H2 \u2192MoO2 + H2O\nMoO2 + 2H2 \u2192Mo + 2H2O.\nHowever, this definition is not unambiguous because different types of molybdenum interact with the surface of the two substrates to different degrees, which is reflected in the low and high-temperature peaks. It is also known [25,49] that the tetrahedral forms of molybdenum are difficult to reduce, while the octahedral forms and other polyhedral forms are easily reduced. Based on the above, the low-temperature peak can be assigned to the octahedral forms of molybdenum, and the high-temperature peak can be assigned to the tetrahedral forms. Co-promotion of composite based on MAS and H-bentonite shifts all reduction peaks to lower temperatures. Peaks were observed at 317, 460, 529, 702, 792, and 827 \u25e6C; this means the reducing ability of molybdenum and nickel is increased. The peak at 460 \u25e6C\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7598 11 of 20\nis associated with the reduction of the NiMoO4 phase [50], which corresponds to the wide-angle scattering data. Thus, the synthesized bifunctional catalysts based on mesoporous aluminosilicate and pre-activated bentonite were characterized by low-temperature N2 adsorption/desorption, X-ray diffraction, TPD-NH3, diffuse reflectance FT-IR spectroscopy, FT-IR spectroscopy and TPR-H2. The distribution of pore sizes and the hysteresis loop of nitrogen adsorption/desorption isotherms of the catalysts confirm the preservation of the hexagonal mesoporous structure even after the introduction of nickel and molybdenum. The X-ray diffraction pattern demonstrates the formation of crystalline phases of nickel and molybdenum. According to TPD-NH3 and IR-Fourier diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, it was shown that all bifunctional catalysts are characterized by weak, medium, and strong acid sites, and the catalyst co-promoted with nickel and molybdenum possesses higher acidity. The reduction ability of the promoting additives of 5% Ni-1% Mo/MAS-H-bentonite catalyst, according to the results of TPR-H2, increases."

            "text": "One of the most important criteria for the operational efficiency of diesel fuels used in cold climatic zones is good low-temperature properties, the values of which determine the operation of the engine power system at negative ambient temperatures and under fuel storage conditions. Low-temperature properties are determined primarily by the content of unbranched paraffins and are characterized by three indicators: pour point, flash point in a closed cup, and cold filter plugging point (CFPP). The object of study in testing the synthesized samples of catalysts was straight-run hydrotreated diesel fraction. The physicochemical parameters of the diesel fraction are shown in Table 5.\nThe group hydrocarbon composition was determined using the chromate-mass spectrometry method to obtain more detailed information about the composition of diesel fractions. This method provides more detailed information about the composition of diesel fractions, as it is able to separate them into different groups of hydrocarbon compounds, which helps to better understand the chemical characteristics of diesel fractions and their potential impact on the environment and diesel engine performance. The group hydrocarbon composition of the studied diesel fraction is presented in Table 6. Analysis of the group hydrocarbon composition of the investigated diesel fraction shows that the original diesel fraction contains a significant amount of n-paraffins (18.15 wt.%), which determines the temperature properties of the diesel fraction. The composition of paraffinic hydrocarbons is characterized by hydrocarbons from C10 to C27. Obviously, when the fuel has a lower n-alkane concentration and a higher iso-alkane content, the cloud point (the temperature at which crystals begin to form) and the maximum filterability of the fuel are reduced, indicating an improvement in performance at lower temperatures. In addition, the raw material contains more than 20 wt.% monoaromatic hydrocarbons. The diesel fraction also contains small amounts of polycyclic aromatic compounds and compounds with heteroatoms.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7598 12 of 20"

            "text": "The developed bifunctional catalysts were tested in the diesel fraction isodewaxing process. The bifunctionality of the synthesized catalysts is determined by the presence of metal and acid sites in them, which makes it possible to provide the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation function for saturation/generation of alkene intermediates, and the acidic function, skeletal rearrangement by the carbenium ion mechanism. Nickel, molybdenum, and nickel-molybdenum systems were used as the hydro/dehydrogenating components, and a mixture of mesoporous aluminosilicate and pre-activated bentonite was used as the acid component. The catalytic activity of the synthesized bifunctional catalysts based on mesoporous aluminosilicates was studied in a flow-type unit with a fixed catalyst bed. Experimental studies were carried out under the following conditions: in the temperature range 260\u2013340 \u25e6C, 2 MPa, H2; the raw material feed rate was 1 h\u22121, and the volume ratio H2:raw material = 100. To determine the yield of the diesel fraction, the products obtained from hydroisodewaxing were stabilized to remove low-boiling products. The results of catalytic hydroisodewaxing of diesel fuels are presented in Tables 7 and 8. Analysis of the data in Table 7 shows that the temperature properties of the obtained products depend on the amount of molybdenum in the composition of the Mo/MAS-Hbentonite catalyst. In both cases, with an increase in the process temperature from 260 to 340 \u25e6C, an improvement in performance is observed: the pour point of the products decreases from\u221226 to\u221241 \u25e6C, and the CFPP also decreases from\u221214 to\u221242 \u25e6C, possibly due to the hydrocracking products of long-chain n-paraffins, which tend to aggregate in diesel fuel and clog fuel filters. However, an increase in the process temperature decreases the diesel fraction yield; this is especially noticeable in the products obtained by the hydrodewaxing process of diesel fraction on the 2% Mo-containing catalyst based on mesoporous aluminosilicate. The decrease in the yield of the target product can be explained by an increase in the proportion of secondary hydrocracking of short-chain n-paraffins formed as a result of hydrocracking of long-chain n-paraffins, with the production of gasoline hydrocarbons, an increase in its yield and a decrease in the yield of diesel fuel. The most optimal conditions for the process of hydroisodewaxing of the diesel fraction on the 1% Mo/MAS-H-bentonite and the 2% Mo/MAS-H-bentonite were 320 \u25e6C, 2 MPa, and 1 h\u22121. While one compares the performance characteristics of the diesel fraction under optimal process conditions, it can be concluded that of the two samples, the 1% Mo/MASH-bentonite catalyst is the most effective, perhaps due to the predominance of easily recoverable octahedral forms of molybdenum according to TPR-H2, which are responsible for hydrogenating and dehydrogenating functions. In addition, a decrease in the yield of diesel fraction with an increase in the molybdenum content in the catalyst is probably due to strong acid sites, according to the TPD-NH3 data responsible for the hydrocracking process.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7598 13 of 20\nThe 5% Ni/MAS-H-bentonite showed the best results among the three synthesized catalysts with different nickel contents. With an increase of nickel content from 1 to 2 and further up to 5 wt.% in the catalyst, under optimal process conditions, the yield of diesel\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7598 14 of 20\nfraction was 92.3, 93.1, and 95.4, respectively; this is probably due to the enhancement of the interaction between nickel and support, which is consistent with the data of TPR-H2 and IR-Fourier spectroscopy. According to the literature data [51], a nickel content of more than 5 wt.% in the catalyst leads to a decrease in the interaction between the metal and the support due to the agglomeration of an excess nickel phase. For the studied sample of the bifunctional catalyst containing 5% Ni and 1% Mo, an increase in the process temperature from 260 to 340 \u25e6C leads to a decrease in the pour point of the products from \u221219 to \u221238 \u25e6C. CFPP also decreased from \u221212 to \u221236 \u25e6C, and the flash point in a closed crucible decreased from 52 to 27 \u25e6C. Therefore, the optimal temperature for the process of hydroisodewaxing of the diesel fraction on the studied catalysts was 320 \u25e6C\u2014the best performance characteristic with the highest output of diesel fraction of 97.4 wt.% was achieved on bimetallic bifunctional catalysts compared to monometallic ones. Results of an analysis of the composition of the process products in the presence of 1% Mo/MAS-H-bentonite, 5% Ni/MAS-H-bentonite, and 5% Ni-1% Mo/MAS-H-bentonite are presented in Table 8. For the bifunctional catalyst 1% Mo/MAS-H-bentonite, the process of hydroisodewaxing proceeds in two directions: hydroisomerization and hydrocracking. An increase in the process temperature from 260 to 340 \u25e6C leads to a decrease in the content of higher long-chain paraffinic hydrocarbons; this is due to an increase in the rate of the hydrocracking reaction respectively, a larger amount of paraffin undergoes this reaction. Insignificant changes in the content of naphthenes in the reaction products compared to the feedstock can be explained as follows. In the case of an increase from 32.78 to a maximum of 35.26 wt.%\u2014probably by the fact that monoaromatic hydrocarbons were hydrogenated at high pressure and temperature; in the case of a decrease from 32.78 to at least 24.84 wt.% part of the naphthenes turned into isoparaffins. The low degree of hydrodearomatization of less than 2% may be due to the predominance of strong acid sites over medium acid sites, which play a key role in the hydroisodewaxing process. The decrease in the yield of diesel fraction correlates with the data on the group composition of hydrocarbons and can be explained by an increase in the proportion of hydrocracking. According to Table 8, on a nickel-promoted catalyst, in contrast to the Mo-containing catalyst, the main reaction of the dewaxing process is the hydroisomerization of higher n-paraffins. The output of isoparaffins, depending on the temperature, pressure, and space velocity of the feedstock, is in a range of values from 16.2 to 29.2 wt.%. Compared to the Mo-containing catalyst, on the 5% Ni/MAS-H-bentonite catalyst, the share of the dearomatization process increases from less than 2 to 3.67%, which may be due to a large number of medium-strength acid sites. Thus, comparing the best molybdenum-containing catalyst with the best nickelcontaining catalyst, it was found that the nickel-promoted catalyst, under identical optimal conditions, showed better performance and greater yield of diesel fraction. Given the sulfur content in the initial diesel fraction of 251 ppm, nickel catalyst poisoning is possible. Hydrocarbons adsorbed on the Ni-S sites migrate to the aluminumcontaining support, where they undergo acid cracking to form cracked products. To solve this problem, the work included a study of the activity of a catalyst with bimetallic systems, i.e., Ni-Mo/MAS-H-bentonite. The role of molybdenum is to attract sulfur to itself and protect nickel from poisoning while nickel itself performs hydrogenation. Table 8 shows that 5% Ni-1% Mo/MAS-H-bentonite is the most promising catalyst out of the six developed ones as it allows for achieving the highest yield of the diesel fraction of 97.4% due to the hydroisomerization of n-higher paraffins contained in the feedstock. At the same time, low pour point diesel fuel was obtained, which, according to operational characteristics, is close to the winter fuel type.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7598 15 of 20"
