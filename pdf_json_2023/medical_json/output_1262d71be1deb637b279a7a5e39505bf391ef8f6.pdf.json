            "text": "Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common mental disorder with various causes that includes significant and chronic depressive syndromes. The main symptoms are depression, loss of interest and lack of energy, accompanied by other cognitive, physiological and behavioral symptoms. The lifetime prevalence of MDD is up to 10.8\u201320.6% (World Health Organization [WHO], 2017), and according to an analysis in the Global Burden of Disease Study 2017, MDD is the third most common cause of the increase in years lived with disability. The etiology of MDD is not fully clear, and many studies suggest it may be associated with genetic factors, changes in neurotransmitter levels, disorders of the neurologic function channel, neuroendocrine disorders, and psychological and social factors (Brown et al., 2015). In recent years, an increasing number of studies have demonstrated that the pathogenic mechanism of MDD might be closely related to a disorder of the gut microbiota (Halverson and Alagiakrishnan, 2020). Short-chain fatty acids (SCFAs), which include butyrate, propionate, and acetate, are essential metabolites for the activity of intestinal microorganisms (Dinan and Cryan, 2017), and they can play a central role through G-proteincoupled receptors in affecting emotional states and recognition, indicating a correlation between SCFAs and the pathogenic mechanism of MDD. This viewpoint was confirmed in an animal experiment (Li J. et al., 2018). Sterile mice showed depression after transplantation of fecal microorganisms from patients with depression (Li B. et al., 2018). A meta-analysis (Sanada et al., 2020) of the human study included eight studies on the differences of intestinal microflora in depression, and the results showed that the results of various studies were not consistent at the phylum level. At the family level, at least two studies showed that the number of patients with depression was decreased, while the number of actinomycetes was increased. At the genus level, at least two studies found that the number of patients with depression was faecalis, ruminal cocci Bifidobacteria and Escherichia coli decreased, while the Pap bacteria increased. A recent review of 26 studies showed that depression patients may be characterized by high abundance of pro-inflammatory bacteria (such as Enterobacteriaceae and Desulfovibrio) and low SCFAs producing bacteria (such as Faecalibacterium) (Simpson et al., 2021). Stevens et al. (2018) compared the intestinal microflora of patients with depression and healthy people, and found that Faecalibacterium and Clostridium XIVa of patients with depression were significantly reduced at the level of genus. Moreover, there are few studies on the correlation between SCFAs and clinical depressive symptoms. Therefore, the impact of drugs on the gut microbiota was excluded in the current study, and patients with first-episode depression were selected for comparisons with the control group (C group) in view of investigating the changes in gut microbiota and metabolite SCFAs and analyzing the correlation between such changes and the disease, which may provide a new therapeutic approach for the treatment of MDD, such as some kind of microbial-rich probiotics or prebiotics."

A total of 22 healthy volunteers, whose gender, age, height, and other demographics matched the patients in the MDD group, were recruited into the healthy C group. The inclusion criteria of the MDD group were as follows: (1) patients or relatives who signed the informed consent form; (2) patients determined to have first-episode depression according to the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), conforming to the ICD-10 diagnostic standard, who had not received systemic treatment with antidepressants; (3) patients aged 16\u201365; and (4) patients with no severe gastrointestinal diseases. The exclusion criteria of the MDD group were as follows: (1) patients having one or more episodes of mania or hypomania, secondary depression, or recurrent depressive disorders; (2) patients administered other probiotics, nutritional supplements (e.g., vitamin C), ginseng, dehydroepiandrosterone, melatonin, antioxidants, antibiotics, laxatives, or other drugs that may affect intestinal homeostasis within 1 month before inclusion; (3) women who were pregnant or lactating; and (4) those on special diets. The inclusion criteria of the C group were as follows: (1) confirmed as healthy in a physical examination, with mental disorders excluded according to MINI; (2) aged 16\u201365; (3) having normal blood routines and normal cardiac, hepatic, and renal function; and (4) willing to sign the informed consent form and able to complete the study. The exclusion criteria of the C group were as follows: (1) had been administered drugs likely to affect intestinal homeostasis 1 month before inclusion; (2) having severe gastrointestinal diseases, organic brain diseases, coronary heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, hepatic diseases, metabolic diseases, or obesity (BMI \u2265 30 kg/m2); (3) women who were pregnant; and (4) those on special diets (Table 1).\nBased on the ICD-10 diagnostic standards, patients conforming to four standards for an MDD episode and presenting two symptoms from symptom groups A and B were diagnosed with a depressive episode. A total of 45 cases were included in the MDD group, but fecal samples were only collected from 35 cases and serum samples from 17 cases due to the pandemic, disqualified sampling, and other reasons. Twenty-two cases were included in the C group. The two groups exhibited no statistical differences in age, gender, BMI, smoking history, waistline, past history, or dietary habits. There were more positive cases of MDD in the family histories of the MDD group than in the family histories of the C group (Table 1).

According to data provided by the National Psychiatric Scale Collaboration Group, an individual with a total score of >29 is considered to suffer from severe anxiety, while a score of >21 means the patient has significant anxiety, >14 means the patient has anxiety, >7 means the patient possibly has anxiety, and <7 means the patient does not have anxiety."

Any DNA that qualified during the test was used for a subsequent test. The primer pairs added with different indexes at both ends were used for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the V4 zone in the 16S rRNA gene (515F-806R) of the bacterial samples. The PCR reaction system (20 \u00b5l) included 10 \u00b5l of KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (KAPA Biosystems, USA), 2 \u00b5l of DNA (around 30 ng/\u00b5l), and 1 \u00b5l of forward/reverse primers (10 \u00b5M). The sequence of the 16S forward primer was 5\u2032- GTGCCAGCMGCCGCGGTAA-3 and that of the reverse primer was 5\u2032-GGACTACNVGGGTWTCTAAT-3. The PCR reaction conditions were as follows: 95\u25e6C pre-degeneration was conducted for 3 min before 30 cycles of 95\u25e6C degeneration were conducted for 20 s, 60\u25e6C annealing was then conducted for 30 s before a 72\u25e6C extension was conducted for 30 s, and, finally, a 72\u25e6C extension was conducted for 10 min. The PCR products were purified using an AxyPrep PCR Cleanup Kit (Axygen, USA) before being eluted. The concentration was determined using Qubit 3.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), and an equal volume was transferred from each sample and mixed to form a sequencing library. The molar concentration and insert fragments of the library were determined and quantified using QSEP100 (BiOptic, China) and ABI7300 fluorescence quantitative PCR systems (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), respectively. The library qualified in the test was used for paired-end 150 bp (PE150) sequencing using the Illumina MiniSeq platform.\n1 https://www.qiagen.com/cn/shop/sample-technologies/dna/genomicdna/qiaamp-powerfecal-dna-kit"

            "text": "Currently, more than 350 million people suffer from MDD, around 4.4% of the global population (Lis\u0301kiewicz et al., 2019),\nindicating that MDD has a serious social impact. Therefore, a study of the pathogenic mechanism and active exploration of effective therapeutic approaches is urgently needed. As demonstrated in various studies (Chen et al., 2021; Foster et al., 2021), the microbiota-gut-brain axis (MGBA) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of MDD, and changes in gut microbiota are a marked feature in patients with MDD. The metabolites of gut microbiota, SCFAs, have been deemed an important mediator for connecting the MGBA (Dinan and Cryan, 2017; de la Cuesta-Zuluaga et al., 2018).\nFrontiers in Psychology 09 frontiersin.org\nThe similarities analysis and the rarefaction curve of gut microbiota indicated that the grouping and sample size in this study were reasonable. In the structural analysis of gut microbiota, no significant difference was found in the \u03b1 diversity of gut microbiota between the two groups (P > 0.05), but the \u03b2 diversity index of the MDD group was higher than that of the C group (P < 0.05). Lai et al. (2021) also found no difference in the Shannon index, reflecting some diversity between the two groups, while they found that the Fisher index reflecting diversity in the MDD group was lower than that in the C group. This was possibly due to the different number of species included in the studies (Madan et al., 2020; Sanada et al., 2020) or because MDD patients who had been prescribed antidepressants were included, while in our study, the patients included were those with first-episode depression who had not been prescribed antidepressants (Wu Y. X. et al., 2020). Considering the results of other studies, the results of the diversity evaluation of gut microbiota in the MDD group were not consistent (Barandouzi et al., 2020; Sanada et al., 2020) with those of the C group. The analysis of dominant bacteria indicated that at the phylum level, similar dominant bacterial phyla were identified in both groups, and there were no statistical differences in abundance between the two groups (P > 0.05). These results were similar to those obtained by Zheng et al. (2016) but were not consistent with those obtained by Jiang et al. (2015) or Chen et al. (2018) as their studies revealed a higher abundance of Actinobacteria and Fusobacteria in patients with MDD, rather than the Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, and other bacteria found in our study. At the genus level, the former four genera of dominant bacteria with similar species existing in both groups were observed (P > 0.05). Currently, it remains debatable which dominant bacteria are in the intestinal tracts of patients with MDD and those of healthy people. As the analysis of differences between key bacteria indicated, at the genus level, the abundance of Akkermansia, Megamonas, Prevotellaceae_NK3B31_group, Lachnospira, Subdoligranulum, Blautia, Streptococcus, and Dialister in the MDD group was lower than that in the C group, and the abundance of Parasutterella in the MDD group was higher than that in the C group (P < 0.05). In addition, the abundance of Parasutterella was negatively correlated with TMT-A time. A significant increase in the abundance of Parasutterella was found in patients with MDD following a stroke (Fan et al., 2016), and TMT-A time use reflects executive functioning, meaning this result indicates that an impairment in the executive function of patients with MDD might be associated with an increase in the abundance of some key bacteria. As demonstrated in previous animal tests, an imbalance of gut microbiota, particularly a decrease in Bacteroides or an increase in Proteobacteria, might be associated with cognitive deficits Shi et al. (2021). Zeng et al. (2019) also found significant changes in the gut microbiota of patients with mild cognitive disorders, mainly an enrichment of Proteobacteria, Synergistetes, and other bacteria and a decrease in Epulopiscium fishelsoni. The result shows that a change in gut microbiota is an important influencing factor for a cognitive change in patients with MDD, implying a possible new approach for the clinical management of\nFrontiers in Psychology 10 frontiersin.org\ncognitive impairment. In addition, the MDD group was found to have a significant decrease in the abundance of butyrate-producing bacteria (Lachnospira, Subdoligranulum, Blautia, and Dialister) and acetate-producing bacteria (Streptococcus). Butyrate affects the effect of anti-inflammatory and intestinal mucosa repair (Liang et al., 2021). Acetate can serve as an energy substance for surrounding tissues, regulate fat cell differentiation, and synthesize long-chain fatty acids, cholesterol, glutamine, \u03b2-hydroxybutyric acid, and other substances (Peng et al., 2021) that are important components of SCFAs.\nAccording to the correlation analysis, Dialister was negatively correlated with the clinical symptoms tested in our study, consistent with the results obtained in a previous study (Barandouzi et al., 2020). The abundance of Dialister was significantly reduced in the patients with MDD, and this change still existed even after excluding the confounding factor of antidepressants (VallesColomer et al., 2019). Therefore, one of the marked features of the disease is a decrease in butyrate- and acetate-producing bacteria (Nikolova et al., 2021). Furthermore, the amount of Dialister was significantly associated with the clinical symptoms of MDD, which indicates that for patients with MDD with an inadequacy of any bacterium, supplementing specific probiotics (e.g., probiotics containing abundant Dialister), butyrate-producing bacteria, or acetate-producing bacteria, and other biological preparations may present a new treatment approach.\nIn fact, SCFAs are the main metabolites that are produced from dietary fibers (Blaak et al., 2020) and other substances that are not easily digested via anaerobic fermentation through intestinal microorganisms in the host body; (Koh et al., 2016) they directly or indirectly participate in the functional regulation of the MGBA (Dalile et al., 2019). Based on the fiber content in a person\u2019s diet, around 500\u2013600 \u00b5mol of SCFAs are produced in the intestinal tract every day, and acetate, propionate, and butyrate are the most abundant SCFAs in the human body (Bongiovanni et al., 2021). Some SCFAs are absorbed by colon cells and enter the citric acid circulation of mitochondria to provide energy to the cells. Other SCFAs that do not enter the metabolism of the colon cells are transported to the portal vein circulation as the energy substrate of hepatic cells. Acetate is a substrate for synthesizing cholesterol and fatty acids, and propionate is the precursor substance for the liver to synthesize glucose. Therefore, intestinal microorganisms can send signals to the brain of the host through SCFAs that enter the circulation system (Wu M. et al., 2020). A clinical trial (Skonieczna-Z\u0307ydecka et al., 2018) found that the amount of fecal SCFAs in patients with MDD was lower than that in the control group. Animal tests have also found that the fecal SCFA content in MDD mice was lower than that of those in the control group (Wu M. et al., 2020), which suggests that a decrease in SCFAs may be associated with the pathogenesis of MDD.\nHowever, in our study, the serum SCFA content in the MDD group was significantly higher than that in the C group (P < 0.05), without a significant correlation with the key bacteria or dominant bacteria in the gut microbiota. The results of the previous animal study would appear to conflict with the results of our study in that the abundance of bacteria-producing SCFAs in gut microbiota (mainly butyrate-producing bacteria) significantly decreased tyrate-producing bacteria and acet, but the content of serum SCFA significantly increased. In previous studies, SCFAs were considered a protective factor for organisms since they\ndecrease the production of proinflammatory factors, maintain mucous form, and promote mucous repair (Dalile et al., 2019). The amount of SCFAs in the feces of depressive mice and humans has been found to be decreased in most cases. The inconsistency between our analysis and the results of other studies may be due to the difference in the participants included and the test methods. Studies have demonstrated that SCFAs enable anti-inflammatory action in the intestinal mucosa by activating the G-protein-coupled receptors in the intestinal epithelial cells and immune cells and by inhibiting histone deacetylase (Parada Venegas et al., 2019; Beurel et al., 2020). The participants included in this study were patients with first-episode depression, mostly in the acute episode stage, meaning their bodies were experiencing immune activation, and SCFAs, as an anti-inflammatory protective factor, might increase irritability in the acute stage. It might also be caused by different dietary habits, and no actual measurement of the components of SCFAs. Total SCFA content was determined in the study, but the content of propionic acid and butyrate were not.\nHu et al. (2011) studied the impact of soluble dietary fiber (SDF) on the serum SCFAs of rats fed with high-fat diets, and their results indicated that SDF from different sources had different impacts on the components of serum SCFAs. In most previous studies, the fecal SCFA content was measured, but only the serum SCFA content was measured in our study, meaning it is not possible to demonstrate the consistency between the changes in fecal and serum SCFAs. Furthermore, few serum samples were obtained, which may have led to some bias. Therefore, in future studies, the components of SCFAs in serum and feces should be measured, and the changes in SCFA content during the episode, remission, and other stages in the course of MDD should also be observed dynamically to better understand the causal relationship between SCFAs and the pathogenesis of MDD.\nThere were a number of limitations in this study. First, the sample size of this study was small (35 fecal samples from the MDD group and 22 from the C group, 17 serum samples from the MDD group and 22 from the C group), and it is still necessary to expand the sample size to further verify the role of gut microbiota and its short-chain fatty acids in the pathogenesis of depression; and the participants included in the study were mostly from Hebei, China, with similar dietary habits. Second, the examination of the gut microbiota was conducted in part using a cross-sectional study, without a dynamic observation of the changes in gut microbiota in the acute stage, remission state, and recovery stage of MDD. Third, the SCFAs in the feces and serum were not tested at the same time, meaning it is not possible to verify whether the change in serum SCFAs also indicates a change in feces. Fourth, the components of the SCFAs were not tested, meaning the results may be less accurate.\nIn this study, the changes in the abundance and diversity of some gut microbiotas in patients with MDD, specifically the significant decrease in butyrate- and acetate-producing bacteria, were observed. Dialister, a key bacterium possibly affecting the pathogenesis of MDD, was found to be closely associated with the clinical symptoms, meaning further studies targeting this bacterium should be conducted. In addition, compared with the C group, the level of SCFA in the serum of the MDD patients was significantly higher. Then, whether Dialister is related to the increase of SCFA in serum, and whether it participates in the pathogenesis of depression through its SCFA, will be worth further\nFrontiers in Psychology 11 frontiersin.org\nexploration.
