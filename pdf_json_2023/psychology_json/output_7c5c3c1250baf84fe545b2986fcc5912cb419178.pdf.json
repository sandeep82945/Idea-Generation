    "abstractText": "Nisin A, the prototypical lantibiotic, is an antimicrobial peptide currently utilised as a food preservative, with potential for therapeutic applications. Here, we describe nisin E, a novel nisin variant produced by two Streptococcus equinus strains, APC4007 and APC4008, isolated from sheep milk. Shotgun whole genome sequencing and analysis revealed biosynthetic gene clusters similar to nisin U, with a unique rearrangement of the core peptide encoding gene within the cluster. The 3100.8 Da peptide by MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, is 75% identical to nisin A, with 10 differences, including 2 deletions: Ser29 and Ile30, and 8 substitutions: Ile4Lys, Gly18Thr, Asn20Pro, Met21Ile, His27Gly, Val32Phe, Ser33Gly, and Lys34Asn. Nisin E producing strains inhibited species of Lactobacillus, Bacillus, and Clostridiodes and were immune to nisin U. Sequence alignment identified putative promoter sequences across the nisin producer genera, allowing for the prediction of genes in Streptococcus to be potentially regulated by nisin. S. equinus pangenome BLAST analyses detected 6 nisin E operons across 44 publicly available genomes. An additional 20 genomes contained a subset of nisin E transport/immunity and regulatory genes (nseFEGRK), without adjacent peptide production genes. These genes suggest that nisin E response mechanisms, distinct from the canonical nisin immunity and resistance operons, are widespread across the S. equinus species. The discovery of this new nisin variant and its immunity determinants in S. equinus suggests a central role for nisin in the competitive nature of the species.",

Produced by bacteria, bacteriocins are a heterogeneous group of ribosomally-synthesised peptides and post-translationally modified peptides (RiPPs) with antimicrobial activity [3,4]. They are small (<10 kDa), with either broad or narrow inhibition spectra and are classified into groups and subgroups according to their structure [5,6]. Class I bacteriocins are post-translationally modified and include lantibiotics, peptides in which serine and threonine residues are dehydrated enzymatically to 2,3-didehydroalanine (Dha) and 2,3-didehydrobutyrine (Dhb), which in turn form lanthionine and methyllanthionine thioether bridges with neighbouring cysteines [7]. Bacteriocins could be an alternative or adjunct to antibiotics, for certain applications. Nisin is the prototypical lantibiotic, first described in 1928 as an \u2018inhibiting effect\u2019 produced by Lactococcus lactis on Lactobacillus bulgaricus [8]. The 34-amino acid lantibiotic has been studied extensively, was granted generally recognised as safe (GRAS) status in 1988, and was approved for use as a food ingredient by EFSA under the code E234 [9]. The\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 427. https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms11020427 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/microorganisms\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 427 2 of 19\nstructure of nisin A produced by L. lactis includes five rings, a three-residue flexible \u2018hinge\u2019 region, and a five-residue cationic tail that interacts with cell membranes and is crucial for activity [10]. Nisin inhibits a broad range of Gram-positive bacterial genera, including many clinically relevant pathogens, biofilms, and sporeformers [11\u201313]. Nisin has also been subject to extensive site-directed mutagenesis, which has identified functionally critical regions in which amino acid substitutions increase or decrease peptide activity against particular organisms [14\u201316]. More than ten natural variants of nisin have been identified since the discovery of nisin A. Nisin Z is produced by L. lactis and contains a single amino acid substitution (His27Asn) [17]. Nisin F and Q are also produced by members of the genus Lactococcus and exhibit only subtle differences in sequence [18,19]. More recently, distantly related nisin J, nisin O (O123, and O4), and kunkecin A were identified from human skin, gut, and honeybee microbiota, and are produced by Staphylococcus capitis, Blautia obeum, and Apilactobacillus kunkeei FF30-6, respectively [20\u201322]. The genus Streptococcus has been a rich source of natural nisin variants, and species of diverse origin produce nisin variants U/U2, H, P, and most recently, G [23\u201327]. Nisin expression is autoregulated by a two-component histidine kinase/response regulator quorum sensing system (nisRK) encoded within the nisin gene cluster [28]. Cells sensing extracellular mature nisin activate the expression of lantibiotic immunity and production machinery from two NisRK regulated promoters [29]. The NisRK two-component system is also exploited by a separate nisin resistance cassette identified in Streptococcus spp., which confers resistance to nisin through proteolytic cleavage and peptide export [30]. In this study, we aimed to isolate and characterise novel bacteriocin-producing lactic acid bacteria. Upon identification of two nisin variant-producing Streptococcus equinus strains, we sought to establish their novelty relative to other nisin producers through genetic comparison and to determine the prevalence of this nisin variant in the species. Comparative analysis of nisin variant gene clusters revealed specific regulatory elements of Streptococcus equinus and other Streptococcus spp. highlighting conservation and diversity across nisin expression regulation systems."

Alignments of the DNA sequence upstream of the serine peptidase encoding gene (nisP) of S. equinus (nisin E), S. agalactiae (nisin P), and S. uberis (nisin U) revealed homology with the NisRK regulated promoters described above (Supplementary Figure S2). Upstream of nseP in S. equinus APC4007 and APC4008, respectively, a conserved sequence of CTGAAC and TAAAAT is present, and these sequences are nearly identical to the nisA consensus sequences of CTGAAC and TACAAT (Supplementary Figure S2)."

            "text": "We describe the production of a novel nisin E variant by two S. equinus strains, APC4007 and APC4008, that were isolated from unpasteurised sheep milk sampled from geographically separate locations in New Zealand; we then further describe the prevalence of this variant across the S. equinus pangenome using publicly available sequences. Nisin E described the following nisins: Z, U, F, Q, H, O1,2,3, and O4, P, J, G, and kunkecin A [17\u201327]. Streptococcal variants now compose 45% (U, H, P, G, E) of the natural nisin variants described, which may suggest an importance of their role in Streptococcus spp. competition and in niche colonisation or quorum sensing. Of the five streptococcal variants, two (P and E) are produced by members of the taxonomically complicated S. bovis/S. equinus complex (SBSEC) [25]. The SBSEC consists of seven species and subspecies which are mainly commensal bacteria that colonise gastrointestinal tracts of animals [46]. Species of the SBSEC are found in unpasteurized ruminant milk, likely via contamination of the teat skin and the teat canal. SBSEC members are implicated in infection and antimicrobial resistance, but are also used in food fermentation. Bacteriocin production by members of the SBSEC has been described previously, including bovicin HC5, bovicin HJ50, bovicin 255, macedocin, macedovicin, gallocin, and gallocin D [47\u201353]. SBSEC member bacteriocin production has been suggested as a mechanism that may support diverse niche colonisation, including opportunistic pathogenesis [52\u201354]. As such, nisin E may confer an advantage to strains of S. equinus to colonise ruminant niches. Despite isolation from sheep milk, both strains of S. equinus produced less nisin E when cultured with lactose (Figure 5). Nisin A expression has been shown to be lactose/galactose inducible, in addition to the traditional NisRK induction [55]. This expression has been attributed to the presence of a NisRK regulated TCT-N8-TCT direct repeat upstream of the nisA promoter [56]. Expression by lactose is not apparent in S. equinus or in nisin P expression from S. agalactiae DPC7040 (Figure 5), which lack a similar repeat 54 bp upstream of the conserved promoter region (Supplementary Figure S2). However other non-lactococcal producers lack the repeat sequence and express nisin when cultured on lactose. This may suggest that the repeat sequence is not required for the expression of nisin on lactose, and that another mechanism limits nisin E and P production on the carbohydrate. Nisin A has a dual mechanism of action, wherein it binds lipid II, preventing cell wall biosynthesis, and subsequently forms pores in bacterial cell membranes. Nisin variants are typically broad spectrum in nature, inhibiting a range of Gram-positive species, but variants may possess different specific activities or be differentially produced. The recently described nisin G produced by S. salivarius DPC6487 was found to be selectively active against 9 of 23 tested bacteria (21 Gram-positive), including Gram negative Fusobacterium spp., whereas a nisin A producer inhibited all 21 Gram-positive isolates to varying degrees [27]. Similarly, nisin E inhibited 9 of the 40 Gram-positive bacteria screened, including Bacillus firmis DPC6349, Clostridioides spp., Lactobacillus spp., and Staphylococcus intermedius DSM20373 (Table 2). It remains to be determined if this is due to a higher minimum inhibitory concentration of nisin E, that it is poorly expressed relative to other nisin variants, or a combination of these factors. Nisin E is the second natural variant of 32 residues to be described, the first being the distantly related nisin O4, produced by the human gut bacterium, Blautia obeum [22]. Nisin E contains 10 differences from nisin A, including 8 substitutions, Ile4Lys, Gly18Thr, Asn20Pro, Met21Ile, His27Gly, Val32Phe, Ser33Gly, and Lys34Asn, and 2 deletions, Ser29 and Ile30 (Figure 2b). Nisin E is very similar to nisin U/U2 and P with just three (93% identity), and four (90% identity) amino acid differences, respectively. Specifically, Ala15, common to both nisin A and E, is changed into an Ile residing in nisin U, while Met21 is changed to Ile in nisin E and Leu in nisin U. The peptide is one amino acid longer than nisins U [23] and P, as nisin E contains an Asn32 residue which is absent in the other 31 amino acid peptides and all other nisins. S. equinus, S. agalactiae, S. gallolyticus subsp. pasteurianus, and S. uberis are closely related and frequently inhabit the same niches, facilitating gene transfer events that may explain the similarity between nisin\u2019s E, P, and U. If streptococcal nisin variants are frequently encountered by bacteria in animal GI-tracts,\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 427 14 of 19\nthen maintaining nisin production and immunity systems would also be beneficial for competition survival. Nisin H, produced by S. hyotintestinalis DPC6484, is less similar to nisins E, P, and U (sharing ~67\u201370% amino acid identity) and more similar to nisin A (85% identity), which may suggest a more recent divergence from lactococcal nisins, which is also reflected in gene cluster structure. Nisin E lacks a serine at position 29, which in nisin A, makes the peptide susceptible to cleavage and inactivation by the nisin resistance protein (Nsr). Therefore, nisin E could be a desirable natural variant that escapes Nsr peptide inactivation, though this has yet to be demonstrated. Nisin E also contains a proline at position 20 which, when bioengineered in nisin A, shows an increased specificity of the peptide towards Staphylococcus aureus; taken together these changes may indicate nisin as a useful natural nisin variant for therapeutic purposes. However, previous studies have demonstrated that shortening the C-terminus of nisin A to 31 residues reduces its activity 10 fold, but nisin1\u201332 exhibits similar activity to that of the full length peptide. Extending the C-terminus has been found to improve the permeation of cell membranes by the peptide and to increase activity against Gram-negative bacteria [57]. However, it remains to be determined if the additional Asn residue impacts the activity relative to other nisins, particularly as Asn is a polar amino acid. Among the variants, the hinge region of natural nisin variants displays a large degree of amino acid variation in residues 20 and 21. The hinge region of nisin A (NMK) is conserved in lactococcal-derived nisins, with the exception of nisin Q (NLK), which contains one amino acid difference. The hinge region of nisin E (PIK) more closely resembles the streptococcal-derived hinge regions, i.e., Nisin U and O (PLK) and nisin P (AIK). This variation likely impacts activity, as bioengineering of the nisin A hinge region has been previously demonstrated to alter the activity of nisin variants [16]. The isoleucine at position 21, within the hinge region of the nisin E peptide (PIK), is also present in nisin P (AIK) [25,26], although the specific three-residue hinge combination is unique to nisin E (Figure 2b). Nisin E genes were detected among S. equinus species and not in other Streptococcus spp., including closely related members of the SBSEC. As such, nisin E production may be a unique feature of the species S. equinus, whereas nisin P has been found to be produced by both S. gallolyticus ssp. pasteurianus and by S. agalactiae DPC7040 [25,26]. The nisin E gene cluster encodes all of the genes typically involved in nisin production, including transport, modification, and immunity. However, the gene order differs from that of other nisin gene clusters, with the structural peptide immediately upstream from the lanFEG transport and immunity genes (Figure 2a). The nisin U gene cluster possesses transposases flanking the gene cluster, as well as another directly upstream from nsuA, to which the reorganisation of the cluster relative to nisin A is attributed [23]. The gene rearrangement of the nisin U gene cluster relative to nisin A is also observed in the similar streptococcal nisin P gene cluster (Figure 2). No transposase sequences were found in the nisin E gene cluster to indicate an obvious mechanism of gene rearrangement. We sought to predict the promoters present in the nisin E gene cluster through sequence alignment with previously characterised promoters in the Lactococcus lactis nisin A gene cluster to provide further insights on nisin expression (Figure 4). The nisin A gene cluster contains two constitutive promoters for the transcription of the nisin immunity protein (nisI) and the response-regulator histidine kinase two-component system (nisRK), respectively [29,58]. It also contains two inducible NisRK-regulated promoters responsible for the expression of the nisin core peptide production (nisABTCI) and transport/immunity genes (nisFEG)(Figure 4) [29]. The constitutive promoter upstream of nisR in L. lactis is not conserved in Streptococcus spp., although we identified putative \u221235/\u221210 regions potentially responsible for NisRK expression. S. equinus APC4007 and 4008 share a conserved \u221210 region and \u221235, which overlaps with a TCT-N8-TCT direct repeat that is highly conserved across all NisRK regulated promoters (PnisA and PnisF). Two such repeats upstream of the transcription start site have been found to be optimal for inducible nisin expression in Lactococcus lactis [56]. Exploring the absence and presence of these repeats across nisin\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 427 15 of 19\nproducers may be of interest in future expression studies to increase production of natural variants, some of which are known to be poorly expressed [22,25,26]. We also predict a third nisin-inducible promoter upstream of the serine peptidase gene (nseP) in the nisin E cluster, which is conserved in nisin U and P and would be essential for expression, given their location at the periphery of the gene cluster. We predict a number of Rho-independent (stem loop) transcription terminators within the nisin E gene cluster, including the presence of a terminator within the nseR open reading frame that may result in reduced levels of nisin production, as has been previously demonstrated [59]. We note the similarity between predicted operon promoter and terminator structure (Figure 4) and the homology between peptide structures (Figure 3). Nisin J from S. capitis APC2923 does not cluster with other nisin variants, and indeed, the nucleotide sequences are highly divergent from other nisin production gene clusters. Interestingly, nisin H from S. hyointestinalis DPC6484 clusters more closely with lactococcal nisins, and the nucleotide sequences containing predicted promoters are dissimilar to nisin E, P, and U (Supplementary Figure S2). Nisin E clusters with closely related streptococcal variants nisin U and P, and is also more related to nisins O1,2,3, and O4 from B. obeum than its lactococcal variants. Nisin E sensing and export/immunity genes (nseRKFEG), without corresponding production machinery genes, were found in 45.5% of publicly available Streptococcus equinus genomes (20/44) (Figure 7). Nisin resistance/immunity gene clusters have previously been described as consisting of an S41 peptidase nisin resistance protein (NSR) and a BceAB-type ABC transporter (NsrFP), which are regulated by the nisin response-regulator histidine-kinase two-component system (NisRK) [30,60]. Genes encoding NSR have been detected in a range of pathogenic and non-pathogenic bacteria, including Corynebacterium spp., Leuconostoc spp., Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus spp., and Streptococcus spp., and typically confer high levels of resistance to nisin [30,61]. The genes identified in S. equinus are distinct from the nisin resistance gene cluster and are homologous to nisin E genes, with 19/20 strains encoding proteins with greater than 90% amino acid identity to NseRKFEG encoded in S. equinus APC4007 and APC4008 (Supplementary Figure S5). Previous comparative genome analysis of 43 L. lactis genomes identified a subset of four strains retaining nisFEG/nisI genes, without biosynthesis genes, but did not determine if these strains retained full immune capacity to nisin [62]. A gene-trait matching study of 710 individual L. lactis strains identified 59 strains that encoded nisRKFEG, without other biosynthetic machinery, and found that nisFEG always co-occurred with nisRK and imparted the ability to survive and acidify milk in the presence a 1.5 \u00b5g\u00b7mL\u22121 level of nisin, but was not as effective as the presence of nsr [63]. The same study identified the presence of the nisin immunity protein-encoding gene nisI co-localised with nisP in 16/710 genomes, which conferred some degree of nisin resistance [63]. The nisIP sub-gene cluster was not detected among S. equinus genomes, which could result from the fact that the two genes are at opposing ends of the nisin E gene cluster, rather than co-localised, as they are in the nisin A gene cluster, which would more easily facilitate co-retention after the loss of other genes (Figure 2a). The presence of nseRKFEG in S. equinus genomes likely confers a level of resistance to nisin E, enabling strains to colonise the same niche as nisin E producers, but without expending the energy involved in nisin production. Nisin A is the prototypical lantibiotic, and it has been extensively researched and utilised since its discovery. Novel variants and related peptides continue to be identified across a multitude of genera, many of which are of interest in the context of the current and growing global AMR crisis. The continued discovery of novel nisin variants highlights the ubiquity of nisin-associated genes across prokaryotic genera, suggesting a strong role in Gram-positive bacterial competition in microbiomes. Features of the nisin E gene cluster in S. equinus shed light on the complexity of nisin cluster structure and expression and highlight some gaps in the current knowledge regarding the regulation of nisin variant expression, despite a long history of nisin expression system exploitation [64]. Further investigation of variant regulatory elements could result in improved production and enable in-depth characterisation and utilisation of non-lactococcal variants. Taken together,\nMicroorganisms 2023, 11, 427 16 of 19\nthe discovery of this new nisin variant in some S. equinus strains, along with the finding that other strains apparently possess immunity determinants which are under nisin control, suggests a central role for nisin in the competitive nature of the species.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/microorganisms11020427/s1, Figure S1: Phylogram and genome average nucleotide identity (ANI) S. equinus APC4007 and S. equinus APC4008, Figure S2: Nucleotide sequence alignment of 200bp region upstream of nisA, nisF, nisP and homologs, Figure S3: Nucleotide sequence alignment of intergenic region upstream of nisR and homologous genes, Figure S4: Nucleotide sequence alignment of 400bp region upstream of nisI and homologous genes, Figure S5: Amino acid percent identity heatmaps of NseRKFEG protein; Table S1: Type and origin of samples from which strains were isolated, Table S2: Genomes of Streptococcus equinus used in pangenome analysis, Table S3: Nisin resistance protein sequences used in pan genome screen, Table S4: Nisin immunity protein sequences used in pan genome screen, Table S5: Nucleotide accessions containing nisin operon sequences, Table S6: ARNold predicted forward strand terminators from nisin variant operons, Table S7: Streptococcus equinus genomes encoding nse genes.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, R.P.R., C.H. and C.S.; methodology, R.P.R., C.H., C.S., I.S, D.H., P.M.O. and I.S.; investigation, I.S. and D.H.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, I.S.; writing\u2014 review and editing, I.S., D.H., P.M.O., L.D., C.S, C.H. and R.P.R.; visualization, I.S.; supervision, R.P.R., C.H. and C.S.
