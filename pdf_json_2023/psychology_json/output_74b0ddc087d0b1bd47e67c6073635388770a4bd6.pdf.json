            "text": "SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve and spread. Recently, the Omicron EG.5 lineage, 20 bearing an additional F456L mutation in spike (S) protein compared to its ancestor 21 XBB.1.9.2, and its sub-variant EG.5.1, which carries a further Q52H mutation, have 22 raised concerns due to their increased prevalence and extended immune escape 23 properties. Additionally, an alarming variant, BA.2.86, has also garnered global 24 concern because it contains over 30 amino acid mutations in its S protein compared to 25 BA.2, including more than 10 changes in receptor-binding domain (RBD), 26 reminiscent of the appearance of the Omicron variant in late 2021. Therefore, there is 27 an urgent need to assess the effectiveness of current vaccines and therapeutics against 28 EG.5, EG.5.1 and BA.2.86. In our previous work, we reported the design and 29 broad-spectrum antiviral activity of a peptide fusion inhibitor HY3000 against 30 SARS-CoV-2 and its variants including XBB.1.5. Here, we continued to evaluate the 31 inhibitory potency of the HY3000 peptide against the prevailing EG.5 and EG.5.1, as 32 well as XBB.1.16, FL.1.5.1, FY.3 and BA.2.86. Our data indicated that the peptide 33 retained its potent inhibitory activities against these variants, indicating its potential as 34 a good virus fusion inhibitor with broad-spectrum therapeutic effect against current 35 and future SARS-CoV-2 variants. Currently, the HY3000 has been finished in Phase 36 II clinical trial in China and has also been approved to conduct clinical investigation 37 by U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), suggesting a good application prospect 38 against the ongoing COVID-19. 39 40\nSevere acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) continues to pose a 42 significant threat to the world, as it continually evolves and gives rise to multiple 43 variants and sub-variants. Recently, the Omicron EG.5 linage, which was first 44 detected in Indonesia on 17 February 2023, has raised concerns due to its increased 45 prevalence and extended immune escape properties, according to the risk analysis by 46 the World Health Organization (WHO)1. As of 26 September 2023, EG.5 and its 47 sub-linages have been reported in 77 countries with shared 40,099 genome sequences 48 in GISAID database (https://gisaid.org/hcov19-variants/). EG.5 has become the 49 dominant strain in the United States according to Centers for Disease Control and 50 Prevention (CDC), accounting for 24.5% of SARS-CoV-2 infections 51 (https://covid.cdc.gov/covid-data-tracker/#variant-proportions), while EG.5.1 is the 52 dominant strain in China on the past three months 53 (https://nmdc.cn/ncovn/china/statistics). Additionally, an alarming linage BA.2.86, 54 with numerous mutations in its spike (S) protein related to BA.2 or XBB.1.5, has been 55 detected in 22 countries (https://gisaid.org/hcov19-variants/), which is reminiscent of 56 the appearance of the Omicron variant in late 2021 and has raised significant 57 concerns2. WHO has designated it as a variant under monitoring (VUM) on 17 August 58 2023 (https://www.who.int/activities/tracking-SARS-CoV-2-variants). Given the 59 increased prevalence, there is an urgent need to assess the effectiveness of current 60 vaccines and therapeutics against EG.5, EG.5.1 and BA.2.86, as well as to develop 61 broad-spectrum countermeasures. 62\n63 The EG.5 linage is a descendant of XBB.1.9.2, which shares the same S amino acid 64 profile as XBB.1.5 and XBB.1.9.1. EG.5 carries an additional F456L mutation in the 65 receptor-binding domain (RBD) of the S protein compared to 66 XBB.1.9.2/XBB.1.9.1/XBB.1.5 (Fig. 1a). EG.5.1 has an additional Q52H mutation in 67 the N-terminal domain (NTD) of the S protein compared to EG.5. Additionally, FY.3, 68 an another prevailing strain in China, has an additional Y200C mutation in the NTD 69\ndescendant of XBB.1.9.1, is currently the second dominant strain in the United States, 71 which possesses two additional mutations (F456L and A701V) and a distinct mutation 72 (T478R) in the S protein compared to XBB.1.9.1. However, in contrast to the 73 abovementioned sub-variants with limited mutations, BA.2.86 bears 34 mutations in 74 the S protein with 14 mutations in the RBD compared to its putative ancestor BA.2 75 and 35 mutations in the S protein with 11 mutations in the RBD compared to XBB.1.5, 76 which imply enhanced immune evasion. Notably, all these variants share the same S2 77 region including heptad repeat 1 (HR1) and HR2, except FL.1.5.1 containing an 78 A701V mutation and BA.2.86 carrying a S939F mutation in HR1 and a P1143L 79 mutation in stem-helix. Thus, we speculate that therapeutics targeting the S2 region, 80 like peptide fusion inhibitor HY3000, which derives from HR2 and targets HR1 of 81 SARS-CoV-2 S (Fig. 1d)3, should remain effective against these variants, but need to 82 be experimentally verified. 83\n84 Previous studies have demonstrated that peptide fusion inhibitors derived from HR2 85 of the SARS-CoV-2 S protein, as well as glycoproteins of other class I enveloped 86 viruses, exhibited efficient antiviral activities against SARS-CoV-2 and related 87 viruses3-8. At the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we designed a peptide fusion 88 inhibitor P3 against SARS-CoV-2, based on our experience in developing peptide 89 inhibitors for SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV4,9,10. To improve the inhibitory activity of 90 P3, we further designed a lipopeptide HY3000, which exhibited significantly 91 increased inhibitory activities against SARS-CoV-2 and all tested variants including 92 XBB.1.5/XBB.1.9.1/XBB.1.9.2, and has currently been finished in Phase II clinical 93 trial in China3. Because of the excellent antiviral potency, we here further evaluated 94 the inhibitory potency of the HY3000 peptide against the prevailing EG.5 and EG.5.1, 95 as well as XBB.1.16, FL.1.5.1, FY.3 and the alarming BA.2.86. 96\n97 Using our previous assessment methods, HY3000 peptide showed expectedly 98\nits activity against the SARS-CoV-2 prototype (PT) strain, with half-maximal 100 effective concentration (EC50) values of ~50 nM (Fig. 1b), consistent with our 101 previous results3. Moreover, HY3000 peptide also displayed similar inhibitory 102 activities against the pseudotyped XBB.1.16, FL.1.5.1 and FY.3 strains as it against 103 PT, EG.5 and EG.5.1. Notably, HY3000 exhibited slightly higher inhibition against 104 BA.2.86 than it against the above sub-variants, with an EC50 value of 28.3 nM. This 105 result possibly attributed to the S393F mutation in the HR1 of the BA.2.86 strain. 106 When modeling S939 to F939 in the HR1 and HR2 complex, we observed that 107 although the aromatic side chain of F939 was oriented away from HR2, it increased 108 hydrophobic interaction with A1190, V1189 and L1186 in HR2 (Fig. S1), thus 109 resulting in the slight improvement. Moreover, HY3000 exhibited potent inhibition 110 against live EG.5.1 strain, with an EC50 of 8.8 nM (Fig. 1c), which was similar to its 111 activities against SARS-CoV-2 PT and previous Omicron sub-variants including BA.1, 112 BA.2 and BA.43. These results suggested that the HY3000 peptide fusion inhibitor is 113 a good virus fusion inhibitor with broad-spectrum therapeutic effect against current 114 and future potential SARS-CoV-2 variants and sub-variants. However, due to the 115 limited resources of the Animal Biosafety Level 3 facility, we have not yet evaluated 116 the inhibitory potency of the HY3000 peptide against live EG.5 in vivo. Nevertheless, 117 based on our previous studies and the efficacy of the peptide in vitro, we speculate 118 that the HY3000 can effectively inhibit live virus infections in vivo. Additionally, 119 given the ongoing evolution of SARS-CoV-2, continuous surveillance of variants and 120 continuous evaluation of antiviral effects of the HY3000 peptide inhibitor are 121 necessary in the future. 122\n123 Acknowledgments 124 This work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China 125 (2023YFC0871300 and 2022YFC2303403) and the National Natural Science 126 Foundation of China (82225021).
