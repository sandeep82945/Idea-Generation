    "abstractText": "Developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) are a group of rare childhood disorders characterized by severe epilepsy and cognitive deficits. Numerous DEE genes have been discovered thanks to advances in genomic diagnosis, yet putative molecular links between these disorders are unknown. CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD, DEE2), one of the most common genetic epilepsies, is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the brainenriched kinase CDKL5. To elucidate CDKL5 function, we looked for CDKL5 substrates using a SILAC-based phosphoproteomic screen. We identified the voltage-gated Ca channel Cav2.3 (encoded by CACNA1E) as a physiological target of CDKL5 in mice and humans. Recombinant channel electrophysiology and interdisciplinary characterization of Cav2.3 phosphomutant mice revealed that loss of Cav2.3 phosphorylation leads to channel gain-offunction via slower inactivation and enhanced cholinergic stimulation, resulting in increased neuronal excitability. Our results thus show that CDD is partly a channelopathy. The properties of unphosphorylated Cav2.3 closely resemble those described for CACNA1E gain-of-function mutations causing DEE69, a disorder sharing clinical features with CDD. We show that these two single-gene diseases are mechanistically related and could be ameliorated with Cav2.3 inhibitors.",

Ultanir 1\nDevelopmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEEs) are a group of rare childhood disorders characterized by severe epilepsy and cognitive deficits. Numerous DEE genes have been discovered thanks to advances in genomic diagnosis, yet putative molecular links between these disorders are unknown. CDKL5 deficiency disorder (CDD, DEE2), one of the most common genetic epilepsies, is caused by loss-of-function mutations in the brainenriched kinase CDKL5. To elucidate CDKL5 function, we looked for CDKL5 substrates using a SILAC-based phosphoproteomic screen. We identified the voltage-gated Ca2+ channel Cav2.3 (encoded by CACNA1E) as a physiological target of CDKL5 in mice and humans. Recombinant channel electrophysiology and interdisciplinary characterization of Cav2.3 phosphomutant mice revealed that loss of Cav2.3 phosphorylation leads to channel gain-offunction via slower inactivation and enhanced cholinergic stimulation, resulting in increased neuronal excitability. Our results thus show that CDD is partly a channelopathy. The properties of unphosphorylated Cav2.3 closely resemble those described for CACNA1E gain-of-function mutations causing DEE69, a disorder sharing clinical features with CDD. We show that these two single-gene diseases are mechanistically related and could be ameliorated with Cav2.3 inhibitors.\nDevelopmental and epileptic encephalopathies (DEE) are characterized by severe early-onset epileptic activity accompanied by global developmental and cognitive impairments. The genetic aetiology of approximately 90 DEEs has been identified1, but targeted therapies remain scarce. Elucidating shared pathways in infantile-onset epilepsies will reveal molecular links between disease genes and greatly advance common targeted treatments. Cyclin dependent kinase like-5 (CDKL5) is a brain-enriched serinethreonine kinase.

Pathogenic missense mutations, almost exclusively located in the kinase domain, indicate that kinase activity is critical for CDD pathology6\u20139. CDD is characterized by infantile-onset, intractable seizures, profound neurodevelopmental impairment in motor and sensory function, impaired language acquisition and autonomic disturbances3,5. The estimated incidence forCDD is 1/42,000 live births each year10\u201312 with approximately 80% being female patients, making it one of the most common types of genetic childhood epilepsy13,14.\nCDKL5 is highly enriched throughout the forebrain with expression starting at late embryonic stages in rodents and humans15\u201319. Low levels of expression were reported in other tissues16. Phosphorylation targets include microtubule binding proteins EB2 and MAP1S6,20 and transcriptional regulators ELOA21 and SOX922, showing its diverse cellular roles. Cdkl5 knockout (KO) neurons have deficits in synaptic differentiation and connectivity, dendritic spine development, neurite outgrowth, cilia elongation and microtubule dynamics23\u201330. However, molecular mechanisms linking CDKL5 loss to neuronal hyperexcitability remain unknown. The identification of key physiological targets of CDKL5 directly involved in the regulation of cellular excitabilitymay help elucidate epileptogenic mechanisms and lead to effective therapies.\nVoltage-gated calcium channels (VGCC) have a key role in physiology, driving neuronal excitability and allowing influx of second messenger Ca2+ ions in response to membrane depolarization31\u201333. VGCC subtype Cav2.3 is formed by the ion-conducting \u03b11E subunit (encoded by CACNA1E) in complex with accessory subunits from the Cav \u03b2 and \u03b12\u03b4 families. Cav2.3 is highly expressed in the CNS, where it is localized at both pre- and post-synaptic sites in neurons, as shown functionally and by immuno-EM34\u201336. CACNA1E knockout mice demonstrated that Cav2.3 mediates neuronal R-type Ca+2 currents36\u201338, so-called due to their \u201cresistance\u201d to organic VGCC channel inhibitors39,40. Cav2.3 is dynamically regulated by phosphorylation at multiple sites41,42. In general, VGCC phosphorylation is an important mechanism by which neuromodulators and their G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) exert their effect on cellular excitability43.\nDe novo heterozygous missense mutations in CACNA1E cause an infantile epileptic encephalopathy (OMIM 618285)44,45. Cav2.3 variants studied in vitro have altered gating and/or inactivation kinetics, leading to gain-of-function (GoF) of Cav2.344,45. Patients with CACNA1E mutations have overlapping clinical phenotypes with CDD, such as intractable seizures, profound intellectual disability and hypotonia (Supplementary Table 1). Single-gene DEEs such as this one are estimated to impact approximately 1/2100 live births10, but their real prevalence is unknown as more genes are being identified rapidly due to recent advances in genetic diagnosis46,47. Despite overlapping clinical features, potential molecular links between these rare disorders remain to be elucidated.\nIn this work, we apply for the first time a global phosphoproteomics approach in Cdkl5 KOmice and identify and validate Cav2.3 as a substrate of CDKL5 in human and mouse neurons. Through our analysis of Cav2.3 function and characterization of a novel Cav2.3 phosphomutant mouse line, in which CDKL5 phosphorylation site is mutated, we reveal that lack of phosphorylation leads to Cav2.3 gainof-function and hyperexcitability. Our results indicate that developmental and epileptic encephalopathies caused byCDKL5 and CACNA1E are related at the molecular level. We propose Cav2.3 as a converging therapeutic target for these disorders."

As expected in Cdkl5 KO neurons, we observe a significant reduction in CDKL5 pS407 and in EB2 pS222, a known CDKL5 phosphorylation target20. Phosphorylation of EB2 S221 was also decreased, indicating co-regulation of these previously reported neighbouring sites. More importantly, a potential new target protein, the ion channel Cav2.3, showed strongly reduced phosphorylation at S15 (pS15), in Cdkl5 KO neurons. Strikingly, themurineCav2.3S15 site (corresponding to S14 in humans) matches the CDKL5 RPXS/T* consensus motif6,20, suggesting direct phosphorylation (Fig. 1a, b). Serine 15, located in the N-terminus of the \u03b11E channel pore subunit (Fig. 1b), is conserved in humans (S14) but absent in the related Cav2.1 (CACNA1A) and Cav2.2 (CACNA1B) channels (Fig. 1b).\nTo test if CDKL5 can phosphorylate Cav2.3 S15/S14, we generated a phosphospecific antibody targeting this site using the mouse sequence. Overexpression of Cav2.3 (& ancillary subunits) together with the CDKL5 kinase domain in HEK293 cells shows strong Cav2.3 phosphorylation in vitro (Cav2.3 pS14, Fig. 1c, f). This phosphorylation is absent when overexpressing phosphomutant Cav2.3 or kinase-dead CDKL5 mutant, demonstrating the specificity of the antibody and the dependence of phosphorylation at this site on CDKL5 kinase activity. Importantly, full-length CDKL5 also phosphorylated Cav2.3 in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 1a, b). Cav2.3 phosphorylation is consistently reduced in the cortex of Cdkl5 KO mice at postnatal day P20 (Cav2.3 pS15), validating the substrate in vivo (Fig. 1d, g). Finally, Cav2.3 pS14 was decreased in human iPSC-derived neurons from CDD patients (Fig. 1e, h), demonstrating altered phospho-regulation of this target in CDD. Together, these results show that Cav2.3 is a bona fide CDKL5 phosphorylation target in mice and humans.\nLoss of Cav2.3 Ser14 phosphorylation slows baseline channel kinetics and amplifies muscarinic regulation Cav2.3 is causally linked to epilepsy by two main lines of evidence. First, channel deletion renders mice resistant to tonic-clonic seizures50\u201352. On the other hand, Cav2.3 GoF leads to severe epileptic encephalopathy in humans44,45. The overlap in clinical manifestations between CACNA1E and CDD patients, including seizures and neurodevelopmental delays, raises the possibility that Cav2.3 regulation by CDKL5 might affect channel function and in turn neuronal excitability.\nTo test the effect of pS14 on Cav2.3 channel properties we used a HEK293 cell line stably expressing the human auxiliary subunits \u03b23 and \u03b12\u03b41 and transiently transfected human \u03b11E and full-length CDKL5 plasmids. Whole-cell patch-clamp recordings of Cav2.3 Ba2+ currents revealed slower decay kinetics (inactivation \u03c4) in S14A mutant channels (Fig. 2a\u2013c). Notably, in absence of CDKL5, WT Cav2.3 decay kinetics were indistinguishable from S14A Cav2.3 mutant (Fig. 2d). We also found a statistically significant increase in whole-cell current density at maximum activation voltages in S14A when compared to WT Cav2.3 in presence of CDKL5 (Fig. 2e). To account for differences in biophysical properties that may be introduced by\u03b11E association with a different \u03b2 subunit53,54, we conducted parallel experiments in a HEK293 cell line stably expressing human \u03b12\u03b41 and \u03b21b, another Cav\u03b2 subunit associated with \u03b11E in the brain55. We used Ca2+ as charge carrier to examine channel properties in a more physiological context. Decay kinetics of WT Cav2.3 currents with \u03b21b were substantially slower than currents with \u03b23 (Supplementary Fig. 2a, b vs. Fig. 1a, b), as previously reported53. In absence of CDKL5 phosphorylation (S14A \u03b11E mutant or kinase-dead CDKL5 conditions), Cav2.3 current inactivation was further slowed (Supplementary Fig. 2a\u2013c), recapitulating our results with \u03b23 (Fig. 2a\u2013c). Current density at maximal activation voltages did not reach significance in the \u03b21-expressing cells, where currents were generally larger (Supplementary Fig. 2d). Finally, we observed no changes in half maximal activation and inactivation potential or time\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:7830 2\ncourse of recovery from fast inactivation in \u03b23- or \u03b21-expressing cells (Fig. 2f and Supplementary Fig. 2e, f).\nAltogether, our results indicate that CDKL5-mediated Ser14 phosphorylation of \u03b11E speeds up the inactivation of human Cav2.3 and suppresses current amplitude, independent of Cav\u03b2 subtype or charge carrier. Consequently, absence of CDKL5 leads to Cav2.3 GoF, with larger and more prolonged currents. A subset of CACNA1E GoF mutations described in human DEE patients also cause slower inactivation kinetics and/or increased current density44, mirroring the phenotypes observed in the unphosphorylated channel. Thus, the functional deficits in Cav2.3 observed in absence of CDKL5 phosphorylation match those\nba Mouse cortical cultures DIV12\nCaV2.3_MS MARFGEAVVVGRPGSGDGDSDQSRNRQ 27 CaV2.3_HU MARFGEAV-VARPGSGDGDSDQSRNRQ 26 CaV2.2_HU MVRFGDELGGRYGGPGGGERA----RG 23 CaV2.1_HU MARFGDEMPARYGGGGSGAAAGVVVGS 27\n*\nd\nCav2.3\nTubulin\n250\n250\n50\nCav2.3 pS15\nWT WT WT KO KO KO\nP20 mouse cortex\ng\nc\n250\n37\nCav2.3 pS14\nCav2.3 (HA)\nkd CDKL5 (HA)\nCav2.3\nkd-CDKL5 WT\nWT\nWT SA WT KA WT WT WT SA WT KA\nHEK293 cells\nf\nC av\np S1\n4 / t\not al\nC av\nCav2.3\nkd-CDKL5 WT S14A WT WT WT K42A\n1.5\n0.5\n0\ne CDD neurons\nCav2.3 pS14 250 250 Cav2.3\n37 GAPDH\ncont 1 cont 2 cont 3R59X R59X ex7\nh\nco ntr\nol CD D\nC av\np S1\n4 /\nto ta\nl C av\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5 p=0006\nEB2 S222\n-2 -1 0 1 2 0\n1\n2\n3\n4\nLog2 fold change (WT/KO)\n-lo g\npva\nlu e\nCav2.3 S15 (CACNA1E)\nCDKL5 S407\nEB2 S221\nCDKL5 motif (R-P-X-S/T)\nI II III IV\nCav\nP\n2\nout\nin\nCDKL5 1E\nto ta\nl C av\n/T ub\nul in\n0\n1\n2\n3\nC av\npS 15\n/ to\nta lC\nav\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\nWT KO\np<0001 p<0001\np=0.005\n1\n4\nWT KO\n2\n250\n50\nKDa KDa KDa\nFig. 1 | Identification and validation of Cav2.3 as substrate of CDKL5 kinase. a Volcano plot of differential phosphoprotein levels between WT and Cdkl5 KO primary neurons, obtained using SILACbased quantitative proteomics (3 embryos/ genotype).

Given the observed GoF in S14A Cav2.3, we hypothesized that muscarinic receptor enhancement may also be affected by CDKL5 phosphorylation. To test this, we co-expressed Cav2.3, CDKL5 and muscarinic acetylcholine receptor type 3 or 1 (M3 or M1), which are prominent brain subtypes known to regulate neuronal Cav2.3 post-synaptically, as well as GFP for visualization. We confirmed that 4 plasmids can be co-transfected with our protocol by immunostaining for each protein (Supplementary Fig. 3a, b).

The current increasewith carbacholwas 1.5- to 2-fold greater in cellswithout phospho-Ser14 at \u221210 mV (Fig. 2g, h, j, l), reflecting Cav2.3 gain-offunction in absence of phosphorylation. The half-maximal activation potential (V1/2) was shifted in the hyperpolarizing direction by 5mV for WTchannels in both cell lines, a described effect ofmuscarinic receptor activation57,59. Interestingly, without Ser14 phosphorylation this shift was significantly greater, implying an effect of phospho-Ser14 on the modulation of Cav2.3 gating (Fig. 2m\u2013p). This represents an additional gain-of-function due to loss of CDKL5, a phenotype comparable to pathogenic CACNA1E mutations that alter V1/244.\nUpon GPCR activation, Cav2.3 channels can be suppressed by G\u03b2\u03b3 subunits. This effect has been observed in G\u03b1q-coupled receptors including M1/M3 in HEK293 cells57 and CA1 neurons56. The Cav2.3 N-terminus andCav\u03b2 are involved inG\u03b2\u03b3 regulation\n60,61. For this reason, we investigated the possibility that the enhanced carbachol effects in absence of N-terminal pS14 could be due to reduced G\u03b2\u03b3 suppression. To distinguish between PKC-mediated enhancement and G\u03b2\u03b3 suppression, we boosted PKC activity prior to carbachol application using phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA), reliably increasing Cav2.3 currents57,62. With further addition of carbachol we found no evidence of muscarinic inhibition of human WT Cav2.3 channels (Supplementary Fig. 2g, h). Moreover, co-expression of Cav2.3 and Gi-coupled dopamine D2 receptors (Supplementary Fig. 3c) to further probe G\u03b2\u03b3 inhibition in our system, revealed significant reduction in peak currents upon D2 activation with quinpirole60. However, there was no difference in inhibitory modulation with or without Ser14 phosphorylation (Supplementary Fig. 2i, j). The above manipulations suggest that G\u03b2\u03b3 is not involved in pS14-dependent Cav2.3 GoF.\nOur results describe two Cav2.3 gain-of-function (GoF) mechanisms in the absence of CDKL5 phosphorylation: slower decay kinetics and a greater hyperpolarizing shift in voltage-dependence of activation (V1/2) uponmuscarinic activation, both reflected in increased Ca 2+ influx through Cav2.3 channels. These GoF features are reminiscent of those described for pathological Cav2.3 variants.\nAltered R-type current inactivation and increased excitability in neurons from Cav2.3 S15A phosphomutant mice To investigate the role of Cav2.3 S15 phosphorylation in neurons, we generated Cav2.3 S15A phosphomutant mice using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. We found that the total S15 phosphorylation levels detected by our phosphoantibody were reduced to background levels of <10% of control levels in homozygous S15A mice (HOM S15A) (Fig. 3a). Heterozygous S15A (HET S15A) mouse brains had approximately 50% of S15 phosphorylation, as expected, while total Cav2.3 levels were not changed (Fig. 3a\u2013c). We compared pS15\nphosphorylation inCdkl5KOmice andphosphomutantmice inparallel on the same experiment and found that 15\u201320% of phosphorylation remained in Cdkl5 KO mice, potentially due to other kinases phosphorylating the same site (Supplementary Fig. 4a, b). To study the role of pSer15 we used HOM S15A mice.\nCav2.3 is highly expressed in the somato-dendritic region of CA1 hippocampal neurons35 where it underlies most of the R-type current and regulates intrinsic excitability36,56. We performed whole-cell somatic recordings in acute slices from young mice and recorded pharmacologically isolated Cav2.3 Ca2+ currents in these cells. When compared to wild type littermates (WT), HOM S15A mice showed significantly slower inactivation \u03c4 at maximal conductance voltages, recapitulating HEK293 cell results (Fig. 3d, e). Current amplitudes at the soma did not differ (Fig. 3f).\nWe next tested the effect of Cav2.3 S15A on neuronal excitability and cholinergic neuromodulation in response to depolarising current injections in adult CA1 pyramidal cells. Resting membrane potential (Vrest), input resistance (Rin) and firing properties were identical between WT and S15A mice under baseline conditions (Fig. 3g\u2013i). Following bath application of carbachol, we observed a 4mV depolarisation in Vrest and a 25% increase in Rin (Fig. 3g), changes that were comparable between WT and S15A neurons (Supplementary Fig. 5a). These alterations are likely due to conductances other than Cav2.3, in line with previous reports59,63,64.\nIn neurons, cholinergic activation can elicit sustained depolarizing plateau potentials (DPPs): all-or-none, large amplitude depolarizations that outlast stimulus-evoked firing59,65,66. A muscarinic medium duration afterdepolarization (ADP) is also reported in CA1 pyramidal cells67. Up-regulation of Cav2.3-mediated R-type currents is required for DPPs and ADPs in hippocampus68 and cortex66. We inspected these Cav2.3-dependent hyper-excitability measures in S15A mice. Carbachol application significantly increased action potential firing frequency in WT and S15A neurons (Fig. 3h\u2013k). At current injections greater than 250 pA, however, phosphomutant neurons responded with fewer spikes and depolarization block towards the end of the stimulus step, indicating greater underlying depolarization. The percentage of cells exhibiting at least one DPP or all-or-none afterdepolarization (ADP) > 8mV upon carbachol treatment was significantly higher in S15A mice, showing an enhanced depolarization response (Fig. 3j, k). Importantly, the occurrence of DPP/large ADPs was shifted towards lower current injections in S15A cells (Fig. 3l). Greater perisomatic depolarization in S15A neuronswas also reflected in a larger ADP at 100ms post stimulus andmore spike attenuation (Supplementary Fig. 5b, c). Together with the enhanced carbachol-mediated hyperpolarizing shift in V1/2 observed in phosphomutant channels in HEK293 cells (Fig. 2j, l), these increased neuronal depolarizations in Cav2.3 phosphomutant mice suggest\nFig. 2 | Functional characterization of phospho-Ser14 Cav2.3 in HEK 293 cells. a Depolarization-evoked current responses in HEK293 cells stably expressing human \u03b23/\u03b12\u03b41 subunits and co-transfected with human Cav2.3 (WT \u03b11E or S14A \u03b11E) and FLAG-CDKL5 full length (WT CDKL5).

The medium- and slowafterhyperpolarizations (AHPs) are critical for spike frequency regulation and their underlying K+ andmixed-cationic currents are targets of the muscarinic system63,69,70. Baseline AHPs elicited by a short spike burst were not different between WT and S15A mice and were equally suppressed by carbachol application (Supplementary Fig. 5d). We also analysed baseline small-conductance Ca2+-activated K+ (SK) currents and spontaneous excitatory synaptic currents (EPSCs), known to be functionally coupled to71 or modulated by72 Cav2.3 in CA1 neurons. We hypothesized that these may be affected given the prolonged Cav2.3 currents in S15A mice, but our measurements show no differences\nd\nb c\nP1 0-\nP1 1\n= 52ms\n= 44 ms\n50 ms\n-10\n0\n10\n20\n30\ncurrent (pA)\n% ce\nlls w\nith D\nPP /A\nD P\n50 15 0\n25 0\n35 0\n45 0 10 0 20 0 30 0 40 0\np=0.04\n-80 -60 -40 -20 0 20 40\n0\n-250\n500\n-750\n-1000\n-1250\npe ak\nc ur\nre nt\n(p A)\nTest pulse (mV)\n40\n45\n50\n55 * *\nTest pulse (mV)\nin ac\nt ( m\ns)\nWT HOM S15A\nco nt co nt CC h CC h\n-55\n-60\n-65\n-70\ng\nV r es\nt ( m\nV)\n50\n100\n150\n200\n250\n300\nco nt co nt CC h CC h\nR in\npu t (\nM\n)\ndep block\nfiring\n20\n100\n60 control CCh 10 M control CCh 10 M\ncurrent injected (pA) 100 200 300 400 100 200 300 400 100 200 300 400\nsp ik\ne fre\nqu en\ncy (H\nz)\n50\n40\n30\n20\n10\n0\na\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\nC av\npS 15\n/ to\nta lC\nav\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\nto ta\nl C av\n/G AP\nD H\nmouse cortex\nCav2.3 pS15\nCav2.3\nGAPDH\n250\n250\n37\nWT He t Ho m WT He t Ho m WT He t Ho m\nWT He t Ho m WT He t Ho m\nfe\nh WT HOM S15A\n-10 0 10 20\nP3 5-\nP4 2\nADP \u2265 8mV\nDPP\ni\n38%\n50 m\nV\n150 pA 1s\ncontrol\n400 pA\n150 pA 1s\n350 pA 1s\n1s\n23%\ncarbachol j k\ncarbachol\n50 m\nV\n8%\n43% **\nl\n*\n% ce\nlls\nWT\nHOM S15A WT HOM S15A\nWT HOM S15A\n0\nWT HO M\nS1 5A\n-1000\n-2000\nIC a2\n+ +\n10 m\nV\np<0001\np<0001\np=0002\np<0.002\np<0.002 p<0.002\np<0.002\np<0.012\nKDa\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:7830 6\nbetween genotypes (Supplementary Fig. 5e\u2013h). Therefore, we suggest that the increased carbachol-induced excitability of CA1 neurons in Cav2.3 S15A knock-in mice is specifically due to Cav2.3 GoF.\nCav2.3 S15A phosphomutant mice have behavioural and EEG deficits Multiple Cdkl5 KO mouse models have been generated by deleting exons 4, 2 or 6, all of which led to loss of CDKL5 protein15,18,49. Numerous behavioural deficits were reported in Cdkl5 deficient mice15,49,73\u201380. Thus, we investigated motor, social and cognitive behaviours in Cav2.3 HOM S15A phosphomutants to test in vivo consequences of loss of pS15 and compare with reported Cdkl5 phenotypes. We noted sex and/or genotype specific effects in some behavioural assays, asdetailed in Fig. 4 andSupplementaryFig6.When monitored in a home-cage environment for prolonged periods, S15A male mice showed reduced locomotion and voluntary wheel use (Fig. 4a and Supplementary Fig. 6a, b), also observed in Cdkl5 deficient mice under similar conditions, although in this case both males and females were affected49. In contrast, we do not observe overactivity or anxiety in the open field test (Supplementary Fig. 6c) as reported in Cdkl5 models of both sexes73\u201375,77,79. Also, unlike Cdkl5 deficient mice15,73,75,79,80, S15A phosphomutants did not present hindlimb clasping (mean scores: males 0; females WT 0.041, HOM S15A 0, p =0.35, n = 8 and 6, Welch\u2019s t test) and performed equally in the rotarod test (Fig. 4b) when compared to WT littermates. On the other hand, S15A femalemice had impairments in sociability (Fig. 4c) which is altered in Cdkl5 KO males15,73,74,79 but not tested in females. Cognitive abilities in the Y-maze were unchanged in phosphomutants (Supplementary\nFig. 6d) but we found deficiencies in memory formation and retention for S15A males in the Barnes maze task and for both phosphomutant sexes in the fear conditioning test (Fig. 4d\u2013f and Supplementary\nFig. 6e, f), indicating a clear overlap with Cdkl5 models, where alterations in spatial and fear memory have been consistently reported for males15,73,74,78,79 and females77. S15Amale deficits in the Barnes maze are not related to locomotion (Supplementary Fig. 6f).\nGiven the high epilepsy incidence in human CDKL5 and CACNA1E DEE patients, we investigated potential seizures. We did not observe any spontaneous behavioural seizures in Cav2.3 S15A mice up to 40 weeks of age, as reported for adult Cdkl5 KO mice15,18,49,81 and rats28, potentially reflecting species differences between rodents and humans. Curiously, seizures are observed in excitatory neuron-specific Cdkl5 KOs or in older heterozygous females81\u201383. Furthermore, electrocorticogram (EcoG) activity recorded in a separate cohort of phosphomutants over twoweeks usingwireless transmitters84 indicate no changes or sex specific effects in baseline ECoG (Fig. 5a). Following these control recordings, seizure susceptibility was analysed with\nrepeated low-dose kainic-acid (KA) injections85 (Fig. 5b, c). We found no differences in maximal KA-induced seizure severity in S15A mice (Fig. 5b), similar to KA-induced seizures in Cdkl5 KO male mice18,49. Interestingly, however, female S15A mice had a reduced threshold to stage 5 behavioural seizures along with an increase in ECoG activity during KA (Fig. 5c). We could not recover transmitter activity during KA for some male mice.\nFinally, since heterozygous Cdkl5 KO females have spontaneous seizures starting at approximately 20 weeks and increasing with age81,83, we investigated the levels of Cav2.3 phosphorylation in brain by comparing 8- and 22-week-old mice. We found that Cav2.3 total levels are increased and relative levels of pS15 are reduced in 22-weekold mice (Supplementary Fig. 7), raising the possibility that increased Cav2.3 expression could contribute to late-onset epilepsy in heterozygous Cdkl5 KO females.\nIn summary, our in vivo analyses of Cav2.3 S15Amicedemonstrate similarities with CDD mouse models and patients, including social, motor and cognitive impairments, and to some extent increased seizure susceptibility. Taken together, these observations suggest that loss of pS15 contributes to the phenotypic features of CDD."

            "text": "There are currently no disease-targeting therapies for CDD and the causes of aberrant excitability in absence of CDKL5 are unknown. Here we identify the alpha subunit of Cav2.3 channel complex as a CDKL5 phosphorylation substrate in mouse and human neurons. CACNA1E mutations cause severe early onset epilepsy in humans and there is some overlap between CDD and CACNA1E encephalopathy (Supplementary Table 1). These include a high incidence of intractable seizures, global developmental delay, intellectual disability, autistic behaviours, a range of motor phenotypes such as hypotonia, hyperkinetic movements and stereotypies, as well as sleep, visual and sensory disturbances. The cellular and circuit basis of these clinical manifestations remains to be dissected in both neurodevelopmental disorders. CDKL5 deficiency is multifactorial as many kinase targets exhibit reduced phosphorylation. Nevertheless, a consistent feature of the Cav2.3 variants associated with epilepsy studied to date is GoF of the channel, by shifting the activation voltage to more hyperpolarized potentials, altering maximal current and/or by slowing inactivation44. Our data shows that deletion of Cdkl5 in mice results in a significant reduction in Cav2.3 S15 phosphorylation, which leads to GoF due to slowed inactivation and amplified gating modulation, similar to the effects observed in Cav2.3 variants. Thus, our results establish Cav2.3 overactivity as a common feature of CACNA1E (DEE69) and CDKL5 (DEE2) epileptic encephalopathies, potentially explaining some of the overlapping clinical features of these diseases.\nFig. 3 | Physiological properties and cholinergic neuromodulation of hippocampal CA1 neurons from WT and phosphomutant mice. a WB validation of CRISPR-generated Cav2.3 Ser15Ala mutant mice using a pS15 phosphoantibody in cortical lysates from 5\u20136-week-old WT, Heterozygous S15A and Homozygous S15A mice.

N-terminal deletions in Cav2.360 or the related Cav2.286,87, result in channels with normal gating and conduction properties. Inactivation kinetics were not measured in these studies, yet interestingly Cav2.2 N-terminal deletion mutants seemed to have slower decaying currents, indicating that this region participates in the regulation of inactivation86. Analogously, loss of N-terminal Ser14/15 phosphorylation slows Cav2.3 inactivation in HEK293 cells and neurons, underscoring a previously overlooked regulatory role of the Cav2.3 N-terminus. This domain may interact with Cav\u03b2, as previously suggested for Cav2.287.\na bLocomotion Rotarod 3-chamber sociability\n0\n1\n2\n3\n1 2 3 1 2 3\nTrial\nfemalesmales\nob jec\nt\nmo us\ne 1 tot al\n0\n1\n2\nob jec\nt mo us e 1 tot al\nEx pl\nor at\nio n\ntim e\n(s )\nSocial preference\nmo us\ne 1\nmo us\ne 2 tot al\nmo us\ne 1\nmo us\ne 2 tot al\nSocial novelty preference\nfemalesmales femalesmales\nLa te\nnc y\nto fa\nll (s\n)\np=0.02\np=0.001\nc\nd e\nx10\u00b2x10\u00b2\nBarnes maze\n0\n20\n40\n60\nLa te\nnc y\nto 1s\nt( s)\n1 2 3 4 1 2 3 4 Day\nfemalesmales\nAcquisition\nmales females 0\n10\n20\n30 p= 0.001 p= 0.0002\np= 0.0028\nProbe Test\nContextual fear conditioning\n0\n20\n40\n60\n% Fr\nee zi\nng\nmales females 0\n20\n40\n60\n80 p= 0.06\np= 0.003\np= 0.02\n0\n25\n50\n75\nLearning\n4 5 6 7 4 5 6 7\nExtinction\npre -U\nS US 1 US 2 US 3 pre -U S US 1 US 2 US 3\nMemory\nno context males females\nDay\np< 0.05p=< 0.05\n0\n20\n40\n50\n% Fr\nee zi\nng\n0\n20\n40\n60\n80\npre -U\nS US 1 US 2 US 3\nContextual fear conditioning - grouped\n4 5 6 7\nf\n0\n20\n40\n60\np=0.0041\n30\n10\nday 2 context day 3 no context\np=0.001\np=0.027\nDay\np< 0.01\nLearning ExtinctionMemory\ncontext\nWT HOM S15A\nfemalesmales femalesmales\nov er\nal l i\nnd ex\n0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nmales females\np<0.0001\np<0.0001\nWT HOM S15A\n0.8\n80\nFig. 4 | Behavioural characterization of Cav2.3 S15A mice. a Overall home cage night-time locomotion index of WT and HOM S15A mice over a three-week period (males WT n = 5, HOM n = 4; females WT n = 4, HOM n = 5; Two-Way ANOVA, Sidak\u2019s; sex x genotype p <0.0001). b Accelerating rotarod performance for a separate cohort (p >0.05, Two-Way ANOVA, Tukey\u2019s).

It is known thatmuscarinic enhancement of Cav2.3 depends on G\u03b1q signalling and PKC phosphorylation at multiple sites, including the intracellular loop I-II62, the most prominent site of \u03b11-\u03b2 interaction54. We show that loss of pS14 interferes with PKC enhancement upon carbachol application, but the mechanisms of this interplay are yet to be established. We ensured multi-plasmid expression by co-transfecting GFP at lower concentration and our immunostainings verified widespread protein co-expression by in HEK293 cells (Supplementary Fig. 3). However, some of the variability in our data could be explained by cell-to-cell differences in levels of coexpressed plasmids.\nOur recordings from hippocampal neurons in Cav2.3 S15A mice demonstrate that S15 regulates Cav2.3 function in neurons. We show that pS15 is critical for R-type current inactivation and regulation of firing by cholinergic stimulation. Isolating Cav2.3 currents is challenging due to space clamp limitations and the need for inhibitors of other voltage-gated channels. These drugs may have promiscuous effects on Cav2.388 or incompletely block other Ca2+ currents56. We observed enhanced neuronal excitability and increased proepileptiform cholinergic ADPs/DPPs59,64 in Cav2.3 phosphomutant mice, an effect thatwasnot linked to carbachol suppression ofAHPs or other intrinsic excitability properties in these cells. Instead, we suggest that the GoF of unphosphorylated Cav2.3 underlies the hyperexcitability seen in response to muscarinic stimulation. Interestingly, Cdkl5 KO mice have altered cholinergic tone76,89 and the muscarinic antagonist Solifenacin was shown to ameliorate network defects in\nCDD patient-derived neurons90, supporting an enhanced cholinergic modulation in this human model.\nWe also found behavioural similarities between Cav2.3 phosphomutantmice andCdkl5KOs. Specifically, S15Amice of both sexes show reduced encoding and retention of fear memory, a robust phenotype replicated in full body KO15,74,77,91 and excitatory neuron-specific92Cdkl5 mousemodels across multiple laboratories. On the other hand, Cav2.3 KOmicedisplay enhanced contextual fear conditioning38, theopposite of our gain-of-functionmutants. Cav2.3 S15A also recapitulate to some extent the spatial cognitive deficits observed in Cdkl5 models in the Barnes maze74,77,78, the reduced home-cage locomotion49,74 and altered sociability observed in global15,49,73,74,79, kinase-dead knock-in91 and inhibitory neuron-specific deletion93 models. The deficits observed in voluntary wheel use in Cav2.3 phosphomutants could be indicative of mild hypotonia94,95, and warrant further investigation.\nImportantly, with the exception of fear conditioning, the absence of behavioural overlap between S15A and Cdkl5 KO mice in each sex (locomotion, social, Barnes maze) as well as the lack of phenotype in phosphomutants for other robust cognitive and motors behaviours such as Y-maze, rotarod, limb clasping and hyperactivity, may be due to additional CDKL5 substrates involved in these behaviours in KO animals.\nCav2.3 KO mice exhibit reduced susceptibility to chemical absence seizures96\u201398 and hippocampal KA-induced seizures52. In agreement with Cav2.3\u2019s role in epilepsy, we find increased seizure susceptibility in females in the low-dose KA injection paradigm in our Cav2.3 S15A mice. Overall, S15A behaviour and seizure phenotypes mirror to some extent human clinical manifestations of CDD, arguing that slowed inactivation and enhanced cholinergic modulation of unphosphorylated Cav2.3 may contribute to these symptoms.\n0 100 200 0\n50000\n100000\n150000\n200000\nTime (min)\nC um\nco as\ntli ne\n[K A]\nWT HOM S15A\n6000\n7000\n8000\n9000\n10000\nC oa\nst lin\ne in\nde x"

Nevertheless, sexspecific differences should be taken into consideration in future Cdkl5 KO mouse behaviour and seizure susceptibility experiments. In Cdkl5 KO males, KA-induced seizure susceptibility changes have not been observed18,49, but this has not been explored in females. On the other hand, reduced latency to seizure initiation with pentylenetetrazole (PTZ, aGABAA receptor inhibitor) injections hasbeen reported inCdkl5 KO males91 as well as heterozygous females75. Finally, increased severity of seizures upon NMDA injections was observed inmale Cdkl5 KOmice due to increaseNMDAR function18, however NMDAR function is not altered in Cdkl5 KO rats28. Disturbance-associated seizures are observed in aged heterozygous females in two different CDD mouse models81,83, an occurrence that may be partly linked to changes in Cav2.3 regulation. It should be noted, however, that S15A gain-offunction in mice is not sufficient to observe spontaneous seizures.\nIn rodents, it is possible to reverse adult phenotypes with reintroduction of CDKL5 genetically73 or using AAV viruses79, indicating an open therapeuticwindow for treatment. Here,we report the functional regulation of Cav2.3 by CDKL5 phosphorylation, which impinges of neuronal excitability. Thus Cav2.3 GoF in absence of CDKL5may be an important molecular mechanism in CDD pathology. Specific Cav2.3 inhibitors would be required to test if inhibition of Cav2.3 could ameliorate CDKL5 deficiency phenotypes in mouse and human models. In addition to CDKL5 and CACNA1E encephalopathies, increased Ca2+ influx through Cav2.3 may contribute to seizures in Fragile X syndrome, as reduced FMRP function leads to increased Cav2.3 expression99. Cav2.3 also increases susceptibility to drug-induced Parkinson\u2019s disease100,101. We propose that Cav2.3 inhibitors/ modulators could be beneficial for CDD patients and potentially for a broader population of neurological patients in the future."

Protocols and procedures were approved by The Francis Crick Institute Ethical Committee, UCLAnimalWelfare and Ethical ReviewBody and theUKHomeOffice. Animalswere housed in a controlled environment with 12-hour light/dark cycle (20\u201324 \u00b0C, 55 \u00b1 10% humidity) and fed ad libitum. Except for some in vivo experiments, mice were housed in groups. Mouse strains were backcrossed into C57 Bl/6 (Jackson) and none of the experimental mice were immunocompromised. Male and female mice aged embryonic day (E)16.5 to postnatal 40 weeks were used as specified.\nCdkl5 KO animals were a kind gift from Cornelius Gross49. Mutant Cav2.3 Ser15Ala animals were created in-house using the CRISPR/ Cas9 system. The guide contained the sequence 5\u2032AGGCUCAGGCGAUGGAGACU3\u2032.

Neurons were plated at a density of 8 \u00d7 106 cells per 10 cm dish coated with 60\u03bcg/ml poly-D-lysine (Sigma) and 2.5\u03bcg/ml laminin (Sigma). Based on methods to achieve accurate SILAC ratios in non-dialyzed serum102,103, cells were grown in neurobasal media free of L-Arginine and L-Lysine (Invitrogen) supplementedwith either L-Lysine-8 (U-13C6, U-15N2) and\nL-Arginine-10 (U-13C6, U-15N4) or L-Lysine-4 (4, 4, 5, 5-D4) and LArginine-6 (U-13C6)(Cambridge Isotope Laboratories). L-Proline (200mg/ml) was supplemented to prevent Arginine to Proline conversion. Each sample was checked for adequate SILAC label incorporation (>90%) andminimal Arginine to Proline conversion (<10%). At DIV4, 1\u03bcM Ara-C was supplemented to inhibit glia growth. For every embryo, one dish of cortical neurons was labeled with K8R10 (heavy) and one dish was labeled with K4R6 (light) amino acids to provide technical replicates. At DIV12, SILAC labelled primary neurons from 3 Cdkl5WT and 3 Cdkl5 KO animals were lysed in lysis buffer containing 20mM Tris pH7.5, 100mM NaCl, 10mM MgCl2, 0.25% IGEPAL NP40, 0.5mM DTT, 1x Protease Inhibitor Cocktail, 1 \u00b5M Okadaic Acid.\nSamples were prepared for mass spectrometry as previously described in104. In brief, protein lysates were mixed in a 1:1 ratio to obtain 3x heavy WT/light KO and 3x heavy KO/light WT samples containing 1mg total protein. Mixed samples were reduced with 5mM DTT, alkylated with 10mM iodoacetamide and quenched with 7.5M DTT prior to o/n digestion trypsin at 37 \u00b0C. Peptides were desalted using 50mg Sep-Pak C18 Cartridges (Waters) and vacuum dried completely before further digestion at 37 \u00b0C using Lys-C for 2 hrs, followed by o/n trypsin digestion. Peptides were desalted and dried again. Mixing and digestion checks were performed after each digestion step. Sampleswere enriched forphosphopeptides according to an in-house protocol using 5mg of Titansphere titanium dioxide beads (GL Sciences) incubated for 10min with peptides resuspended in loading buffer (80% acetonitrile, 5% trifluoroacetic acid, 1M glycolic acid). TiO2 beads were subsequently washedwith loading buffer, wash buffer 1 (80% ACN 1% TFA) and wash buffer 2 (10% acetonitrile, 0.2% trifluoroacetic acid), and peptides were finally eluted using 1% ammonium hydroxide and 5% ammonium hydroxide subsequently. Combined phosphopeptide eluates were vacuum dried completely and desalted using C18 Stage Tips and vacuum dried completely. Samples were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until required for analysis by mass spectrometry.\nMass spectrometry of enriched phosphopeptides Samples were analysed by online nanoflow LC-MS/MS using an LTQ Orbitrap Velos mass spectrometer (Thermo Scientific) coupled to an Ultimate 3000 RSLCnano (Thermo Scientific). Resolubilised sample (10\u03bcL per injection in 1% aqueous trifluoroacetic acid, TFA)was loaded via autosampler into a 20\u03bcL sample loop and pre-concentrated onto a cartridge trap column 300\u03bcm I.D. \u00d7 5mm, packed with Acclaim PepMap100 C18, 5\u03bcm, 100\u00c5 using the loading buffer, 2% v/v acetonitrile, 0.05% v/v trifluoroacetic acid, 97.95% water (Optima grade, Fisher Scientific) at a flow rate of 20\u03bcL/min for 2min in the columnoven held at 40 \u00b0C.

Only precursors with charge state >2 were permitted for selection for fragmentation and dynamic exclusion\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:7830 10\nwas enabled to exclude after n = 1 times within 20 s for 20 s. Fragmentation was subsequently performed on all selected precursor masses and the MS2 scan data was acquired in centroidmode. For the method with CID activation MS2 scans were acquired in the linear ion trap following CID fragmentation with normalized collision energy of 30%, Ion Trap MSn AGC target 1e4 and maximum injection time 100ms. For the method with CID activation andmulti-stage activation enabled parameters were as for CID but with normalized collision energy of 35% and a neutral loss mass list (32.70, 49, 98). For the method with HCD activation MS2 scans were acquired in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 7500 FWHM at m/z 400, following HCD fragmentation with a normalized collision energy of 45%. The parameters used for the HCD MS2 scan were fixed first mass 100m/z, FTMS MSn AGC target 5e4, maximum injection time 500ms.\nThe acquired raw mass spectrometric data was processed in MaxQuant105 (version 1.3.0.5) for peptide and protein identification, the database search was performed using the Andromeda search engine against the Mus musculus canonical sequences downloaded from UniProtKB (August 2012, 77938 sequences). Default search settings were used including an FDR of 1% on the phosphosite, peptide and protein level and matching between runs for peptide identification. K4R6 and K8R10 were set as labels with a maximum of 3 labeled AAs. Phosphorylation at serine, threonine or tyrosine residues, oxidation (Met) and protein N-terminal acetylation were set as variable modifications. Carbamidomethylation of Cys-residues was set as a fixed modification.\nData was further processed in Perseus v.1.6.15.0. Phospho (STY) sites from the six experimental samples in the MaxQuant search were loaded and site tables expanded. Potential contaminants and reversed hits were removed. Normalized H/L ratios were log2 transformed and filtered for rows containing at least three valid values. Potential CDKL5 substrates were annotated using the R-P-X-pS/pT motif. A onesample t-test was performed comparing the normalized ratios to the null hypothesis and visualized as a volcano plot.\nThe mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE106 partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD038505."

Whole-cell patch clamp recordings in isolated cells were performed 48\u201372 h post-transfection at room temperature. Transfected cells were identified by GFP fluorescence. Data were sampled at 20 kHz and filtered at 1\u20132 kHz. Cells were continuously perfused (1ml/min) with extracellular solution containing (in mM): NaCl 120, TEACl 20, HEPES 10, glucose 10, KCl 5, MgCl2 1, CaCl2 or BaCl2 5, pH7.4withNaOH. Pipettes (2.5\u20133.5\u03a9M)were pulled from borosilicate glass (1.2 \u00d7 0.69mm, Harvard Bioscience) and filled with the following intracellular solutions adapted from41 to minimize current run-down (in mM): CsMeS 140, EGTA 5, MgCl2 0.5, MgATP 5, HEPES 10, for GPCR experiments; CsMethanesulfonate 125, TEACl 5, EGTA 5, MgATP 5, Na3GTP 0.3, Na-phosphocreatine 5, Napyruvate 2.5, HEPES 10, pH 7.25, 285\u2013295mOsm, all other recordings. Upon seal break, currents were evoked every 5/10 s with a step from \u221280/\u2212100mV (holding potential, HP) to 0/+10mV. After an initial runup period, steady state current voltage (IV) relationships were obtained with 100ms depolarising test steps to +60/+80 in 10mV increments every 10 s. For voltage dependence of inactivation the protocol consisted of a 1 s pulse from \u2212140 to +20mV in 10mV increments, followed by a 50ms test pulse to 0mV, every 10 s. Peak currents (Ipeak) in response to test voltages (Vtest) were used to plot IVs and measure the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation. Reversal voltage (Erev) was estimated by extrapolating a linear fit to the IV curve from +20- + 40mV. Conductance (g) was calculated using the equation (g = (Ipeak)/(Vtest-Erev)). Voltage of half-maximal activation or inactivation (V1/2) weremeasured by fitting with a Boltzmann equation (Y =A + (B-A)/(1+exp((V-V1/2)/K)) where Y is the conductance or the current, andA andB are theminimumandmaximumamplitudes of the fit. Time course of open state inactivation (\u03c4inact) was estimated by fitting a single exponential function to current decay in response to\ntest pulses. The average of 3 fits at each voltage was used. For all transfection conditions, cells with outward currents >40% of the peak current at +10mV or with \u03c4inact that did not decay uniformly with depolarization were excluded from analysis. Similarly, cells were not used for current density or \u03c4inact comparisons if run-downwas >30% of the maximal current recorded in the experiment as this is known to affect inactivation time41. To examine recovery from inactivation, an inactivating pulse to +10mV of 0.8\u20131 s (pulse 1), was followed by a variable recovery period (\u0394150\u2013200ms) and a test pulse to +10mV (pulse 2), at 0.1\u20130.3Hz. Time course of recovery was calculated using the ratio of Ipeak in response to pulse 2/pulse 1 plotted against duration of recovery period and fitted with single exponential equation. Carbachol, quinpirole and PMA were bath applied at ~3ml/min whilst activating Cav2.3 currents with brief monitoring (25ms) test steps to 0 or +10mV, every 2, 5 or 10 s, depending on speed of run-down. Upon steady state, IVs were obtained. Cells included in the analysis showed no significant changes in series resistance and a consistent shift in activation V1/2, with current amplitude matching between IV and brief monitoring steps. Leak and capacitance subtraction was applied to all recordings using -P/5 protocol and series resistance compensated from 75\u201395% to keep voltage error <7mV."

Somatic whole-cell patch clamp recordings were obtained from CA1 pyramidal neurons using borosilicate electrodes (3\u20134.5 M\u03a9). Series resistance (Rs) and input resistance (Rin) were monitored throughout recordings using a 100ms, \u22125mV step from \u221260mV to evoke passive membrane responses. Rs was calculated from the amplitude of the capacitive transient and Rin from the steady state currents. These were sampled at 20 kHz and filtered at 10 kHz. The maximum change in Rs permitted was 25%.\nR-type Ca2+ currents. Recordings were obtained from young neurons (P10-11) no longer than 6 h post slicing using the blind technique.

After 10min stabilization in the whole-cell configuration, IV curves were obtained with voltage steps from \u221280 to +40, HP = \u221270mV. A -P/5 leak and capacitance subtraction protocol was used and Rs was compensated 65\u201385%, to minimize voltage error. Capacitance (Cm) was calculated using equation: Cm [pF] = \u03c4m [ms]/Rs[M\u03a9], where \u03c4m is the decay time constant of capacitative transients.

A positive correlation was found between \u03c4inact and Cm for Cm< 80pF, thus this was established as the cut off cell size criteria for inclusion in \u03c4inact comparisons. Cells with large outward currents at depolarising voltages (>50% of the peak current at +10mV) were also excluded.\nSmall-conductance Ca2+-activated (SK) currents and excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSC). Recordings were obtained from adult neurons (5\u20136weeks) in transverse slices. SK currentsweremeasured as tail currents following a 100ms step from \u221250mV to +10mV (0.3 Hz) to engage VGCCs. Standard aCSF (CaCl2 2mM, RT) was supplemented with (in \u03bcM): TTX 0.5, TEA 1000 and XE991 5, to isolate SK currents by inhibiting temporally overlapping voltage-gated Na+ and K+ conductances. The intracellular solution was (inmM): KGluconate 135, KCl 10, Na-phosphocreatine 10, MgATP2 2, Na3GTP 0.3, HEPES 10, pH 7.3, supplemented with 8-cloro-phenylthio cAMP 50\u03bcM, to inhibit the slow afterhyperpolarizing current. SK current identity was confirmed at the end of all experiments by reversible d-tubocurarine (dTC, 50\u03bcM) inhibition. dTC-subtracted currents were used for quantification. Traces were sampled at 5 kHz and filtered at 1 kHz. SK current amplitudewasmeasured at the peak of the after-current and charge as the integral 500ms post stimulus.

Recordings were obtained from adult neurons (5\u20136 weeks) in coronal slices in standard aCSF (2mM Ca2+, 30\u201332 \u00b0C) and Kgluconate-based internal solution. Membrane potential (Vrest) was measured throughout the recording with 0 current injection and maintained around \u221265mV during stimulation. Inputoutput relationships were obtained with 1 s current injections from \u2212100 to 450pA in 50pA increments. Traces were sampled at 10 kHz and filtered at 5 kHz. Action potentials were identified with thresholdbased event detection (0mV) and amplitude measured from Vrest. Spike attenuation during the train was calculated as ratio between last andfirst spike amplitudes. Depolarizing plateaupotentials (DPPs)were defined as sustained depolarizations >20mV upon stimulus termination. Medium duration afterdepolarizations (ADPs) were measured 100ms post-1s step depolarization. Firing patterns were compared using binomial tests or comparisons of non-linear least squares regression fits to the data distribution. The effect of carbachol on the medium and slow afterhyperpolarizations (mAHP and sAHP) was used as positive control for muscarinic receptor activation. AHPs were evoked at \u221265mV by a burst of five 2 nA, 2ms somatic current injections at 100Hz every 20 s and measured at the peak and 500ms post stimulus respectively.\nAll patch clamp data was obtained with Multiclamp 700B, Digidata 1440A and pClampTM 10 software (Molecular Devices).

The recording electrode was placed above the visual cortex (AP -2, ML 1.5) and the ground electrode in the contralateral prefrontal hemisphere (AP 1.8, ML 1.5).

Researchers were blinded to animal genotype during data acquisition and analysis.\nKainic acid susceptibility. At the end of the chronic recordings, low dose 5mg/kg kainic acid (Tocris Bioscience) dissolved in sterile saline was administrated intraperitoneally every 30min to assess brain susceptibility to increasing dosage of chemo convulsant. The clock started at the first injection from 0min. Seizure severity was initially assessed while the experiment was ongoing at 10-minute intervals, using a modified Racine scale: 1. immobility; 2, hunched position with facial jerks, 3. rearing and forelimb clonus, 4. persistent rearing and forelimb clonus, falling, 5. generalized tonic clonic convulsions, or wild jumping85. These assessments were confirmed by re-analyzing the video recordings. Latency measures the length of time from the start of the experiment to the first indication of generalized seizure (Stage 5 on Racine scale). Both kainic acid inductions and analysis were performed by a researcher blinded to the genotypes. A total of 17 implanted mice were used for susceptibility experiments, one male mousewas removed from the study due to surgical complicationswith the transmitter. In a subset of these where transmitter performance was not compromised, ECoG recordings during seizure inductions were recovered and used for quantification. Traces were analysed using semi-automated seizuredetection as described previously84. The cumulative coastline was calculated from when the first epileptiform activity was detected until the mice reached generalized seizure (stage 5)."

The DVC consists of standard size, barcoded IVC units equipped with a 3 \u00d7 4 arrangement of cage-floor electrodes. Capacitance sensing-based detection of animal position allows for real-time tracking of locomotion activity 24/7. Following a 2-week-acclimatization period, baseline activity was recorded and analysed. Rotating wheels (\u00d8 4.4 in) were then introduced, and animals allowed to familiarize themselves for another week before data collection. All activity metrics were calculated using the DVC Analytics 3.4.0 platform108. For locomotion index, the average signal of all 12 cage electrodes was used. Data were grouped in 60min bins for each day. Animals were kept in DVC cages up to the age of 40 weeks.\nBehaviour tests. Behaviour experiments were conducted in 8-weekoldWT and homozygous S15A Cav2.3 of both sexes, housed under an inverted light cycle. Mice were handled daily for one week prior to experiments. Two cohorts ofmice were used for all 7 behaviour tests, carried out in the specific order described below to minimise the possibility of one test influencing the evaluation of the subsequent test. Similarly, to avoid unnecessary stress, mice were allowed to habituate to the testing room for at least an hour before the behaviour tests. Lighting was manipulated depending on the specific behaviour experiment. Aversive light levels were avoided where possible. Animal weight was monitored weekly to check that it did not drop below 10% of the weight at the start of testing. All tests were video recorded for off-line analysis. Tracking data were analysed using Ethovision XT 15 (Noldus Information Technology, Netherlands) equipped with three-point (nose, body centre, and tail) detection settings.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:7830 13\nOpen field test. The apparatus consisted of an illuminated (70 lux) white floor PVC foam arena (50\u00d7 50\u00d7 40 cm). A central zone (16 \u00d7 16 cm)was pre-defined. Testmicewere placed in the centre of the open field and allowed to explore the arena for 30min. At the end of each trial, themousewas returned to the home cage and the arenawas cleaned. Total distance travelled in 30min and percentage of time spent in the central zone were used as measures of locomotor activity and anxiety levels, respectively.\nAccelerating rotarod test. Day 1: Mice walked on a rotating rod (Ugo Basile model 47650, Italy) at constant speed (4 rpm) for three minutes for two acclimatization trials. Day 2: Each mouse was placed on the rotating rod for three test trials, during which the rotation speed gradually increased from 4 to 40 rpm within four minutes. The inter trial interval was 1 h. Performance was evaluated by measuring the latency to fall.\nHind-Limb clasping. Mice were suspended by the middle of the tail and lifted 15 cmabove the ground; the extent of hind-limbclaspingwas recorded for 15 s. The room lighting was kept at 90 Lux. Hind-limb clasping was scored from 0 to 3: score 0 = both hind limbs were splayed outward away from the abdomen; score 1 = one hind limb retracted inward toward the abdomen for at least 50% of the observation period; score 2 = both hind limbs partially retracted inward toward the abdomen for at least 50% of the observation period; score 3 = both hind limbs completely retracted inward toward the abdomen for at least 50% of the observation period. Hind-limb extension reflex severity scores were calculated by averaging three trials separated by 1min.\nThree-chamber social interaction test. The apparatus consisted of a white rectangular PVC foam arena (62 \u00d7 42 \u00d7 23 cm) divided into one central and two adjacent compartments of equal size compartments connected by square openings. Empty cylindrical wire cages (\u00d8 8 cm, height 18 cm) were placed in the lateral chambers. Each mouse was placed in the central chamber and allowed to explore the arena for 10min. The brightness of the room was kept at 10 lux. Chamber occupancy during habituation was equal between groups. After this, the mouse was returned to the waiting cage for 3min. To assess social preference, an unfamiliar WT mouse of the same age, sex and strain (stranger 1) was gently introduced inside one of thewire cages to serve as a social stimulus. An unfamiliar and inanimate object was added to the other wire cage as the non-social stimulus. The test mouse was placed in the apparatus containing the social and non-social stimuli for 10min. After that, the test mouse was removed and kept in the waiting cage for 3min. All compartments were cleaned with 30% ethanol solution before the next test phase. To assess preference for social novelty, the non-social object from the previous test phase was replacedby anunfamiliarmouse (stranger 2) and the previous stranger 1 (now familiar mouse) was placed into the wire cage of the opposite compartment. The test mouse was placed in the central chamber and allowed to explore the arena for the next 10min, after which it was returned to the home cage. The location of the novel and familiarmice with respect to the side compartments was counterbalanced across trials. The exploration of the targetmouse/object was scoredwhen the mouse\u2019s nose was detected within 2 cm from the cylindrical wire cage.\nY-maze spontaneous alternation test. Testing occurs in a Y-shaped maze with three arms (1, 2, 3) made of opaque plastic (34 \u00d7 9 \u00d7 14 cm) oriented in a 120\u00b0 angle. Each mouse was randomly placed into one arm and allowed to explore the maze for 10min. Room lighting was kept at 10 lux. An arm entry was recorded manually when the mouse moved beyond the central triangle of the maze and entered an arm with all four paws. Alternation behaviour was defined as consecutive entries into each of the three arms in overlapping triplet sets (e.g.: 1, 2,\n3 or 2, 1, 3 or 3, 2, 1). The percentage of alternations was calculated as the number of actual alternations divided by the maximum possible number of arm entries.\nBarnes-maze test. Twenty-four hours before training, the animal was habituated to the apparatus and escape box for a minute. During the training phase (4 days), mice were trained to locate the target hole (with an escape chamber underneath) from among 20 holes evenly spaced around the perimeter of an elevated circular open field (\u00d8 96 cm). Each animal was initially placed in the centre of the arena covered by an opaque cylinder, which was removed 10\u201320 s after the start of the trial. Room lightingwas kept at 635 lux. Themouse is then free to explore the platform for 3min using four visual cues to aid navigation. If the mouse does not enter the escape chamber within 3min the experimenter guides the mouse gently to the escape box (20\u00d7 11 \u00d7 7 cm) and leaves themouse inside for 1min. This step is repeated twomore times a day (3 trials in total per day)with at least 20min in betweenwhere themouse is placed back in its home cage. To assess learning, a probe test in carried out 24h after the last training, where the escape box has been removed from the target hole. The mouse is placed on the platform and free to explore it for 3min. Distance to first: distance walked from the centre of the arena to the target hole (centre-point detection); latency to first: time to reach the target hole from the centre of the arena (centre-point detection); errors to first are defined as checking any hole before reaching the escape box (nose-point detection).\nContextual fear conditioning. The fear conditioning chamber (27 \u00d7 27 \u00d7 35 cm, UgoBasile, Italy) was equippedwith a shock grid floor and a digital Near Infrared Red Video Fear Conditioning system. Mice from each genotype and sex were examined in four successive phases comprising: conditioned acquisition (day 1), memory of the conditioned background context A (day 2), exploration in new background context B (day 3) and memory extinction in the conditioned context A (day 4\u20137).\nContext A was characterized by a cubic shape, illuminated at 100 Lux and the presence of a vanilla odour. The floor consisted of metal rods, mediating the foot shock. Context B was also cubic shaped, not illuminated and without additional odour cues. On day 1: Mice were introduced in the conditioning chambers scented with vanilla odour for 8min and received 3 unconditioned stimuli (US: 1 s, 0.25mA foot shock, 2min inter-trials interval). To examine the conditioned response to the context, mice were reintroduced in the training context 24 h later (day 2) andmonitored for 5min in the absence of theUS. On day 3, the mice were introduced to a new context (context B) for 5min to examinewhether freezing behaviour is associated to a specific context (context A). During days 4\u20137micewere placed back in context A without US to assess extinction of the association of the specific context A and the US (which is described as a form of new learning)."
