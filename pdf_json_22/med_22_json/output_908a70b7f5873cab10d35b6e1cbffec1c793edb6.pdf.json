    "abstractText": "Background: Many studies have reported high efficacy and safety of artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ) and artemether-lumefantrine (AL) when administered under direct observation in Cameroon. There is paucity of data to support their continuous use in home-based treatment of uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in Cam\u2010 eroon. Hence, this study aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of AS-AQ versus AL for home-based treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria among children 6\u2013120 months in Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon. Methods: A two-arm, open-label, randomized, controlled trial comparing the equivalence of AS-AQ (experimental group) and AL (control group) was carried out from May 2019 to April 2020 at two secondary hospitals in Yaound\u00e9. Participants were randomized to receive either AS-AQ or AL. After the first dose, antimalarial drugs were given at home, rather than under direct observation by a study staff. The conventional on-treatment and post-treatment laboratory and clinical evaluations were not done until day 3 of the full antimalarial treatment course. The evaluation of effectiveness was mainly based on per protocol polymerase chain reaction adjusted adequate clinical and parasito\u2010 logical response (PP PCR adjusted ACPR) on day 28 post-treatment. Safety was based on assessment of adverse events (AEs) and severe adverse events (SAEs) from day 1 to day 28. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

BMC Infectious Diseases (2022) 22:166 Background Malaria remains a major public health challenge in sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America despite the deployment and scaling up of control measures [1]. In 2020, the disease accounted for 241 million cases and 627,000 related deaths worldwide [1]. Since April 2001, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the swift change of policy from monotherapies to artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) in the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria due to rapid emergence and dispersal of drug resistant parasites [2]. Clinical trials are the mainstay for monitoring the efficacy of ACTs in  vivo [3]. WHO has approved six ACTs: artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ), artemether-lumefantrine (AL), dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ), artesunate-mefloquine (AS-MQ), artesunate + sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS + SP) and artesunate-pyronaridine (AS-PY) [4, 5]. The sixth ACT (AS-PY) was recently adopted due to its high efficacy and safety profile despite initial concerns raised in previous studies [6, 7]. Cameroon adopted the use of AS-AQ and AL in 2004 and 2006 respectively for the treatment of P. falciparum malaria [8]. AS-AQ and AL have been in continuous use since their introduction in 2004 and 2006. Both AS-AQ and AL are used in the Southern regions, but in the North and Far North regions, AL is primarily used for treatment and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SPAQ) is used for seasonal malaria prophylaxis among children 3 to 59 months [9]. Antimalarial drug effectiveness is a composite assessment that encompasses clinical efficacy (the performance of the medicine under controlled conditions) and real-world clinical practice (less optimal conditions) [10]. Several ACTs have been shown to be highly efficacious [11\u201315] and effective [16, 17] in the treatment of malaria in different endemic countries across the world. The ACTs already adopted by the WHO are safe with no major adverse events reported [18\u201321]. Presently, the ACTs are under threat due to the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the P. falciparum kelch 13 propeller gene conferring resistance to the artemisinins [22]. The prevalence of the mutations (F446I, N458Y, N458Y, Y493H, R539T, I543T, P553L, R561H, P574L, C580Y) has been well documented in the Greater Mekong sub-region in Southeast Asia [23\u201325]. The occurrence of the C469Y [26], R561H [27\u201329], P574L [27\u201329] and A675V [26] polymorphisms has also been recently reported in Africa. This may negatively affect the gains already achieved in the drive towards malaria elimination in endemic countries if measures to curb the threat are not urgently put in place. Furthermore, it has been shown that the emergence of drug resistant parasites could be delayed by using multiple first line ACTs [30, 31]. The WHO recommends the change of treatment lines if the efficacy of ACTs is less than the minimum benchmark of 90%. Many studies have reported high efficacy and safety of artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) and artemether-lumefantrine (AL) under strict drug administration in Cameroon [13, 32, 33]. There is paucity of data to support their continuous use in home-based treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria Cameroon. Hence, this study aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of AS-AQ versus AL for home-based treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria among children 6\u2013120 months  in Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon.",

            "text": "Malaria remains a major public health challenge in sub-Saharan Africa, Southeast Asia and Latin America despite the deployment and scaling up of control measures [1]. In 2020, the disease accounted for 241 million cases and 627,000 related deaths worldwide [1]. Since April 2001, the World Health Organization (WHO) has recommended the swift change of policy from monotherapies to artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs) in the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria due to rapid emergence and dispersal of drug resistant parasites [2]. Clinical trials are the mainstay for monitoring the efficacy of ACTs in\u00a0 vivo [3]. WHO has approved six ACTs: artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ), artemether-lumefantrine (AL), dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-PPQ), artesunate-mefloquine (AS-MQ), artesunate + sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (AS + SP) and artesunate-pyronaridine (AS-PY) [4, 5]. The sixth ACT (AS-PY) was recently adopted due to its high efficacy and safety profile despite initial concerns raised in previous studies [6, 7]. Cameroon adopted the use of AS-AQ and AL in 2004 and 2006 respectively for the treatment of P. falciparum malaria [8]. AS-AQ and AL have been in continuous use since their introduction in 2004 and 2006. Both AS-AQ and AL are used in the Southern regions, but in the North and Far North regions, AL is primarily used for treatment and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SPAQ) is used for seasonal malaria prophylaxis among children 3 to 59\u00a0months [9].\nAntimalarial drug effectiveness is a composite assessment that encompasses clinical efficacy (the performance of the medicine under controlled conditions) and real-world clinical practice (less optimal conditions) [10]. Several ACTs have been shown to be highly efficacious [11\u201315] and effective [16, 17] in the treatment of malaria in different endemic countries across the world. The ACTs already adopted by the WHO are safe with no major adverse events reported [18\u201321].\nPresently, the ACTs are under threat due to the identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the P. falciparum kelch 13 propeller gene conferring resistance to the artemisinins [22]. The prevalence of the mutations (F446I, N458Y, N458Y, Y493H, R539T, I543T, P553L, R561H, P574L, C580Y) has been well documented in the Greater Mekong sub-region in Southeast Asia [23\u201325]. The occurrence of the C469Y [26], R561H [27\u201329], P574L [27\u201329] and A675V [26] polymorphisms has also been recently reported in Africa. This may negatively affect the gains already achieved in the drive towards malaria elimination in endemic countries if measures to curb the threat are not urgently put in place. Furthermore, it has been shown that the emergence of drug resistant parasites could be delayed by using multiple first line ACTs [30, 31].\nThe WHO recommends the change of treatment lines if the efficacy of ACTs is less than the minimum benchmark of 90%. Many studies have reported high efficacy and safety of artesunate-amodiaquine (ASAQ) and artemether-lumefantrine (AL) under strict drug administration in Cameroon [13, 32, 33]. There is paucity of data to support their continuous use in home-based treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria Cameroon. Hence, this study aimed to assess the effectiveness and safety of AS-AQ versus AL for home-based treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria among children 6\u2013120 months\u00a0 in Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon."

The PP PCR adjusted day 28 cure rates were [AS-AQ = 96.9% (95% CI, 91.2\u201399.4) versus AL = 95.5% (95% CI, 89.9\u201398.5), P = 0.797]. Expected mild to moderate adverse events were reported in both arms [AS-AQ = 83 (84.7%) versus AL = 99 (86.1%), P = 0.774]. The most common adverse events included: transient changes of hematologic indices and fever.\nConclusions: This study demonstrated that AS-AQ and AL are effective and safe for home management of malaria in Yaound\u00e9. The evidence from this study supports the parallel use of the two drugs in routine practice. However, the findings from this study do not describe the likely duration of antimalarial effectiveness in holoendemic areas where multiple courses of treatment might be required.\nTrial registration: This study is a randomized controlled trial and it was retrospectively registered on 23/09/2020 at ClinicalTrials.gov with registration number NCT04565184.\nKeywords: Plasmodium falciparum, Malaria, Effectiveness, Safety, Artesunate-amodiaquine, Artemether-lumefantrine, Cameroon\nYaound\u00e9 (3\u00b050\u2032N 11\u00b031\u2032E) in the Center Region is found at an elevation of 760\u00a0m (2493 feet) above sea level [34].

Thick and thin blood films for parasite counts and speciation of non-falciparum species were obtained and examined at screening on day 0 to confirm adherence to the inclusion and exclusion criteria [39]. Thick blood films were also examined on days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28 or on any other day if the patient returned spontaneously and parasitological reassessment was required. The slide for each patient was prepared in duplicates. Thick and thin blood films were dried and stained with 10% Giemsa for at least 15\u201320\u00a0 min. Giemsa-stained thick and thin blood films were examined at a magnification of 1000 \u00d7 to identify the parasite species and to determine the parasite density. At least 200 white blood cells (WBCs) were counted. Parasite density was calculated by multiplying the number of parasites counted per microscopic field by a factor of 40 on the assumption that the average count of WBC is 8000 per \u00b5l. If on counting 200 WBCs, the number of parasites was not up to 100, the count continued till 500 WBCs and calculations made to get the estimated parasitemia of the patient. Parasitemia was reported in parasites/\u03bcl. A microscopy slide was considered negative when examination of 1000 white blood cells or 100 fields containing at least 10 white blood cells per field revealed no asexual parasites. The presence of\ngametocytes on an enrollment or follow-up slide was also recorded. To detect the presence of gametocyte, at least 1000 white blood cells were counted. Two qualified microscopists read all the slides independently, and parasite densities were calculated by averaging the two counts. Blood smears with discordant results (differences between the two microscopists in species diagnosis, in parasite density of > 50% or in the presence of parasites) were re-examined by a third, independent microscopist, and parasite density was calculated by averaging the two closest counts. Additionally, 10% of all the slides were randomly selected and read by a senior microscopist for quality control.

Summarily, DNA fragments obtained from amplification of baseline samples (day 0) and on the day of recurrent parasitemia were compared according to band size and number, considering the 3 families of Pfmsp-1 (MAD20, RO33, K1), the 2 families of Pfmsp-2 (FC27, 3D7/IC) and single family type of Pfglurp. Cases were categorized as new infections when there were no common bands between day 0 and the day of recurrent parasitemia. However, when there was at least one common band between baseline sample and that of the day of parasite reappearance for any of the 3 markers (even if there were additional bands on day 0) the case was recrudescence. Malaria parasite infected cases were considered not to be clinical failures if their recurrent parasitemia were classified as new infections rather than recrudescent infections.

            "text": "The present study had as primary objective to determine the effectiveness and safety of artesunate-amodiaquine (AS-AQ) versus artemether-lumefantrine (AL) for a period of 28\u00a0days among children infected with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria in Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon. The effectiveness of the two drugs was assessed under less optimal conditions to mimic what happens in the communities 17\u00a0 years after their adoption and implementation in Cameroon. The approach adopted for this study is a modification of the standard procedure recommended by WHO for monitoring the efficacy of ACTs [3]. The standard method describes what is expected in health care but not what is observed.\nThe evaluation of in\u00a0 vivo effectiveness using per protocol (PP) analysis gave an adjusted PCR-ACPR value above the WHO benchmark of 90% for AS-AQ. Similar adjusted PCR cure rates for AS-AQ have been recorded before in Cameroon [12] and Burkina Faso [15]. The adjusted PCR cure rate for AS-AQ is higher than the range of 60.0% to 91.7% obtained from studies conducted at the slope of Mount Cameroon [43] and other countries [16, 44\u201348]. Conversely, the adjusted PCR-ACPR of the present study is lower than range of 98.1%-100.0% registered in supervised clinical trials conducted in Cameroon [13], Burkina Faso [14, 15], Ghana [49] and Senegal [50]. The assessment of in\u00a0vivo effectiveness using PP analysis also registered a corrected PCR cure rate above 90% for\nAL. This finding is in agreement with the adjusted PCR cure rate of 95.1% registered in rural Tanzania in 2011 [17]. The adjusted PCR-ACPR is lower than the rates of 96.0\u2013100.0% reported in malaria endemic countries in sub-Saharan Africa [13, 49\u201351], Southeast Asia [11] and South America [52]. A systematic review and meta-analysis on the therapeutic efficacy of AL (Coartem\u00ae) for the treatment of P. falciparum malaria in Africa gave a pooled PCR adjusted 97.0% [53]. The adjusted PCR cure rate for AL is higher than the range of 77.7\u201394.0% previously documented in several antimalarial drug effectiveness [16, 44, 46, 48] and efficacy [15] studies conducted elsewhere. The lower limit of the confidence interval for AL success, as reported, was less than 90% (the WHO benchmark), while the lower limit of the confidence interval for AS-AQ was slightly above this benchmark (91.2%). The differences observed in the effectiveness rates of AS-AQ and AL may be due to heterogeneity of study settings, participants, malaria transmission patterns, sample sizes, and development of resistance against artemisinin partner drugs. Even though, mutations conferring resistance to the artemisinins have not been reported in Cameroon, there is a need to regularly monitor the effectiveness and efficacy of antimalarial drugs as recommended by the WHO.\nThe comparison of in\u00a0vivo effectiveness on day 28 did not show any significant difference between AS-AQ and AL. This is in agreement with the findings of the comparative effectiveness and efficacy studies in which the two drugs were used [13, 44, 48]. The insignificant difference in the in\u00a0vivo effectiveness of AS-AQ versus AL disagrees with the results reported in Burkina Faso [15, 46]. These findings confirm the parallel use of AS-AQ and AL for the treatment of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria.\nFurthermore, the present study registered very few cases of reinfection 14\u00a0 days post-treatment. This observation tallies with those of other studies that showed an increase in the effectiveness [16, 43, 44, 46, 48, 54] and efficacy [11\u201315] of AS-AQ and AL after correction\nTable 6 (continued)"

The AL drug arm documented more cases of reinfections after 14\u00a0 day of follow-ups when compared with the AS-AQ drug arm [16, 44, 46, 48, 54]. The lack of direct supervision during drug administration did not seem to lower the effectiveness of the ACTs below the acceptable WHO benchmark of 90%. This could be due to perfect adherence by the caregivers to the dosing regimens. There are conflicting claims on the impact of adherence on antimalarial drug efficacy and effectiveness. Some studies did not find a difference in the PCR cure rates between ACT dispensed supervised and unsupervised [17, 45, 54]. This is inconsistent with the findings from another study that reported a significant difference between supervised and unsupervised therapeutic responses [55]. The difference observed may be due insufficient patient adherence. It has been revealed that antimalarial drug efficacy and effectiveness is influenced by a plethora of factors. These factors include: delayed access to drugs, bioavailability, drug quality, drug storage conditions, age [17, 56, 57], multiplicity of infection [58, 59], malaria parasite density [56, 60], immunity [61], pharmacogenomics [62, 63] and nutrition [64].\nIn both drug arms, fever and parasite disappeared gradually by day 3. Rapid fever and parasite clearance rates have been reported before in Senegal/Ivory Coast [65, 66], Cameroon [13], and Togo [67]. The presence of gametocytes at enrollment and during follow-up days was found to be higher in the AS-AQ group when compared to the AL group. These observations are in harmony with those reported in Senegal/Ivory coast [65, 66] and Togo [67]. A meta-analysis from individual patient data conducted by the Worldwide Antimalarial Resistance Network (WWARN) Gametocyte Study Group confirmed that AL is more effective than the AS-AQ fixed dose combination in preventing gametocyte carriage shortly after treatment [68]. The authors suggested that the non-artemisinin partner drugs and the timing of artemisinin dosing are important determinants responsible for post-treatment gametocyte dynamics [68]. Information on gametocyte carriage reported during this study is important to guide Cameroon government\u2019s policy on malaria control and elimination especially in regions where transmission occur throughout the year.\nIn addition, expected mild to moderated adverse events were documented in the two drug arms that resolved during follow-up. There was no severe adverse event registered among the study participants. Previous pharmacovigilance studies on AS-AQ and AL have mostly reported the presence of common adverse events associated with the gastrointestinal tract and neuropsychiatric systems [13, 18, 19]. This approach of monitoring adverse events relies on self-reporting by the patients, parents or guardians. A major setback\nof this method is recall bias. Some parents or guardians may actually have over-reported perceived adverse events because of anxiety about the possibility of adverse events.\nThe study drugs had a statistical significant effect on 9 biological parameters on day 0 and day 7 in the AS-AQ and AL arms. It was also shown that AS-AQ and AL drugs had varying effects on alanine aminotransferase (ALAT) and creatinine (CREA) levels on day 0 and day 7. These results corroborate with those realized in Senegal and Ivory Coast [65]. These observations also confirm the findings of the study on the efficacy and safety of ACTs in Garoua and Mutengene, Cameroon reported by Nji and colleagues in 2015 [13]. The resolution of abnormal values during follow-up is an indication that AS-AQ and AL are well tolerated and safe."

            "text": "The major strengths of this study are: (1) This work filled significant gaps in knowledge about the performance of AS-AQ and AL in Cameroon, which should provide important support for policy-making. (2) Both regimens were studied concurrently in the town of Yaound\u00e9 in Cameroon seventeen years after policy implementation. The existence of data from previous efficacy trials of the same regimens in the same region was also important. (3) The fact that the study was performed in a holoendemic region in Cameroon is actually important, because the national malaria control program needs data from diverse transmission settings in order to devise rational policy. (4) The design was intended to \"mimic the routine standard of care\" by omitting clinical supervision of treatment, clinical evaluation, and laboratory testing after day zero and before day three. This is actually a strength given the study team\u2019s emphasis on effectiveness.\nThe major limitations of this study are: (1) There was no direct clinical observation of antimalarial drug dosing (after dose 1), and standard clinical and laboratory evaluations were not conducted after day zero and before day 3. (2) The study was conducted in urban and peri-urban settings of Yaound\u00e9. These areas are characterized with holoendemic malaria transmission. This may not present the reality of what happens in the other malaria transmission settings in Cameroon and globally. (3) The estimated sample size may have been inadequate to establish the equivalence of the two drugs. (4) Families who were willing to be adherent to medication and clinical/laboratory evaluation schedules may not have been representative of the entire population from which the subjects were drawn. Hence, study results may not be generalizable."

            "text": "This study demonstrated that AS-AQ and AL are effective and well tolerated for home management of uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria among children in Yaound\u00e9, Cameroon. The PP cure rates adjusted by PCR and safety parameters for the two drugs were not statistically different and are said to be substantively the same when compared. The two regimens seem to have retained their effectiveness and safety profiles for over 17\u00a0 years, in spite of frequent administration likely driven by the intensity of malaria transmission. The evidence from this study supports the government\u2019s policy on the parallel use of AS-AQ and AL in routine practice in the Southern regions of Cameroon. However, the findings from this study do not describe the likely duration of antimalarial effectiveness in holoendemic areas where multiple courses of treatment might be required. It was also reported that the lower limit of confidence interval was slightly below or above the WHO threshold of 90% for AL and AS-AQ respectively. Thus, there is a need to continuously monitor the effectiveness and safety profile of AS-AQ and AL in Cameroon.\nAbbreviations ACT : Artemisinin-based combination therapy; ACPR: Adequate clinical and parasitological response; AL: Artemether-lumefantrine; ALT: Alanine ami\u2011 notransferase; AS-AQ: Artesunate-amodiaquine; AST: Aspartate aminotrans\u2011 ferase; CREA: Creatinine; ETF: Early treatment failure; LCF: Late clinical failure; LPF: Late parasitological failure; WHO: World Health Organization; WWARN: Worldwide Antimalarial Resistance Network.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s12879\u2011 022\u2011 07101\u20112.\nAdditional file\u00a01: Study treatment\nAdditional file\u00a02: Reference ranges of heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, hematology parameters and biochemistry parameters\nAdditional file\u00a03: Kaplan\u2013Meier survival curve for the effectiveness of AS-AQ versus AL (PP without and with PCR correction)\nAdditional file\u00a04: Evolution of biological parameters among study partici\u2011 pants treated with AS-AQ and AL (Day 0 and Day 7) (PP)\nAcknowledgements The authors sincerely thank all those who accepted to participate in the study.\nAuthors\u2019 contributions WFM, MA, PTNN, JDB, AMN and IMA conceived the study and coordinated the research work.
