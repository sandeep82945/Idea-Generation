Based on the provided text, the portions that mention future research directions are as follows:

1. "Due to the inconsistent findings of some of these earlier studies, additional investigation into the environmental effects of economic policy uncertainty is necessary. This motivates our work."

2. "Additionally, no recent study or previous study to the best of our knowledge has focused on the impact of technological innovation using the instruments of patent registrations and EPU on carbon emission - in a single study - with a primary motive to assess the overall effect of the levels of innovation level. Here again, this study plugs this identified gap."

3. "There is thus the need for further investigation using other functional econometric forms and new data variables as additional controls. This is where our paper adds to the debate by filling some of the voids."

These excerpts suggest areas where further research is needed or where the current study seeks to address gaps in the existing literature.
