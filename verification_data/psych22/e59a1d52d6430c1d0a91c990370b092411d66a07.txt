"Current findings provide evidence on how PA may moderate the association between TV watching and depressive symptoms in the European adult. Future interventions should focus on the reduction of time spent TV watching and increasing PA participation as a mean to reduce depressive symptoms. Policies should promote less time TV watching in the early life stages and should be a priority since research has found that SB habits from earlier life years proceed to adulthood (48). Providing more opportunities for engaging in PA should be a priority for public authorities to reduce the individual and the economic burden associated with poor mental health (7)."
