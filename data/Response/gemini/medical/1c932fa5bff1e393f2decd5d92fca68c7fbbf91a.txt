1. **Investigate the use of FET biosensors for the early detection of AD.** 
Current methods for diagnosing AD are often invasive and expensive. FET biosensors could provide a less invasive and more affordable way to detect AD early, when treatment is most effective.


2. **Develop FET biosensors that can detect multiple AD biomarkers simultaneously.** 
This would allow for a more comprehensive assessment of AD risk and progression.


3. **Explore the use of FET biosensors for monitoring AD treatment.** 
This could help to ensure that patients are receiving the most effective treatment and that their condition is not worsening.


4. **Investigate the use of FET biosensors for the development of new AD therapies.** 
FET biosensors could be used to screen for new drugs and to study the mechanisms of action of these drugs.


5. **Develop FET biosensors that can be integrated with other devices, such as smartphones or wearables.** 
This would make it possible to monitor AD biomarkers continuously and remotely, which could lead to earlier detection and more effective treatment.
