    "abstractText": "In the field of high accuracy dual-axis rotational inertial navigation system (RINS), the calibration accuracy of the gyroscopes and accelerometers is of great importance. Although rotation modulation can suppress the navigation error caused by scale factor error and bias error in a static condition, it cannot suppress the scale factor errors thoroughly during the maneuvering process of the vehicle due to the two degrees of rotation freedom. The self-calibration method has been studied by many researchers. However, traditional calibration methods need several hours to converge, which is unable to meet the demand for quick response to positioning and orientation. To solve the above problems, we do the following work in this study: (1) we propose a 39-dimensional online calibration Kalman filtering (KF) model to estimate all calibration parameters; (2) Error relationship between calibration parameters error and navigation error are derived; (3) A backtracking filtering scheme is proposed to shorten the calibration process. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can shorten the calibration process and improve the calibration accuracy simultaneously.",

            "heading": "1. Introduction",
            "text": "Rotational inertial navigation systems (RINS) have reached high accuracy of navigation in recent years [1,2]. A RINS consists of three gyroscopes, three accelerometers, and one rotational table. the inertial measurement unit (IMU) is installed inside the two-axis rotation table [3]. The accuracy of RINS highly depends on the accuracy of the accelerometers and gyroscopes, hence, the calibration parameters of the IMU are very important [4]. The RINS makes the online self-calibration of IMU a real, self-calibration is an effective way to improve the navigation performance of RINS [5]. Many researchers have studied the INS calibration method [6\u20139]. Ren et al. proposed a multi-position self-calibration method for dual-axis RINS [10]. In [11], Zhang et al. analyzed the multi-position calibration method for IMU. In [12], an eight-position self-calibration method for a dual-axis RINS. Syed et al. proposed a multi-position calibration method for MEMS inertial navigation systems [13]. Jiang et al. in [14] have proposed a 36-dimensional KF for systematic calibration. Wen et al. have added gyro-accelerometer asynchronous time as a state variable in self-calibration KF [15]. Jing et al. in [1] have analyzed the data of the gyroscope to improve the accuracy of the calibration. In [16], Song et al. have added inner lever-arm parameters for RINS, which denotes the distance between the sensitive center of the accelerometer and the center of rotation of the IMU. Based on previous research, the authors have derived a complete IMU calibration error model. However, a higher filtering dimension means slower computation and slower convergence. Nowadays,\nSensors 2022, 22, 5036. https://doi.org/10.3390/s22135036 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nthe demand for the rapid response of navigation equipment is higher, and it will be very inappropriate to self-calibration for a few hours before utilization. It should be noted that in high accuracy INS applications (the accuracy of the gyro is better than 0.01 \u25e6/h, generally ring laser gyro or fiber optic gyro), the systematic calibration process can last for 3 h. Hence, many researchers have utilized the backtracking navigation method to shorten the filtering time, this method has been applied in initial alignment widely to shorten the alignment time. Yan et al. proposed a reverse navigation algorithm for INS gyrocompass in-movement alignment [17]. Li has applied the backtracking navigation method in underwater vehicle applications [18]. In [19,20], the authors have proposed a backtracking integration for fast attitude determination-based initial alignment. Li et al. utilized a backtracking navigation scheme for autonomous underwater vehicles [20]. In the application field of RINS, Song et al. proposed a rapid initial alignment scheme for dual-axis RINS [21]. Based on the previous studies, the backtracking navigation scheme has been proved that can effectively shorten the alignment time in the INS initial alignment process. However, there are few studies have applied the backtracking scheme in RINS calibration method. The backtracking scheme can be applied to the RINS calibration method in theory. However, we need to propose a rotation scheme that can excite all the calibration parameter errors during the rotation process. Hence, a detailed observability analysis is needed. In [15], the authors have analyzed the observability of the 19-position rotation scheme. Tang et al. has utilized piecewise constant systems (PWCS) and singular value decomposition (SVD) method to provide the observability analysis of KF [22]. Cai et al. provided an observability analysis for IMU in a three-axis rotation table [23]. In [24], the authors have studied the observability of strapdown INS alignment. However, the decoupling relationship between the calibration parameters and navigation velocity error has not been studied in previous studies. Therefore, there is a lack of a specific theoretical guide for the rotation path design to excite all the calibration parameter errors. To solve the above problems, an improved online fast calibration method for dualaxis RINS based on a backtracking scheme is proposed in this paper. The self-calibration method has been studied by many researchers. However, traditional calibration methods need several hours to converge, which is unable to meet the demand for quick response to positioning and orientation. Kalman filtering has both accuracy and real-time performance, but the convergence is slow, so our method can ensure short-term convergence and the realtime performance of the algorithm. The processer we utilize in dual-axis RINS is DSP6748, it has lower computing power because it is a low-power chip. So KF is used in the system. To solve the above problems, we do the following work in this study: (1) we propose a 39-dimensional online calibration Kalman filtering (KF) model to estimate all calibration parameters; (2) Error relationship between calibration parameter errors and navigation error is derived, which can be a theoretical guide for the design of calibration rotation path; (3) A backtracking filtering scheme is proposed to shorten the calibration process. Experimental results indicates that the proposed method can shorten the calibration process to 1 h and improve the calibration accuracy (within 0.5 ppm) simultaneously. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 gives reference definitions of the proposed calibration method. In Section 3, we derive a 39-dimensional filtering model and analyze the error relationship between calibration parameters error and navigation errors. In Section 4, the online self-calibration method based on the backtracking scheme, is provided. A rotation test is carried out in Section 5 to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. In Section 6, we give the conclusions."

Accelerometer second-order nonlinear coefficient specific force sensitive term (which can be estimated in high accuracy accelerometers like quartz accelerometer) is described as: f IA2=M f KA2,\nwhere M f = diag (( f as f x )2 , ( f as f y )2 , ( f as f z )2) is the matrix composed of the square term of the\ntheoretical specific force sensitive to the triaxial accelerometer.

Furthermore, the effect of the inner lever arm r I is considered. The inner lever arm refers to the distance vector from the IMU sensitive center (IMU rotation center) to the three-axis accelerometer. When the carrier moves angularly, the inner lever arm will cause the tangential acceleration and centripetal acceleration that the accelerometer is sensitive to. Since the installation error angle of the accelerometer is a small angle, only the inner lever arm in the direction of the sensitive axis of the accelerometer is considered, and the rotational angular acceleration is not considered, the specific force-sensitive term f Ir of the inner lever arm of the accelerometer can be expressed as [15]:\nf Ir=M\u03c9r I (5)\nwhere, M\u03c9=diag [( \u03c9IiIy )2 + ( \u03c9IiIz )2,(\u03c9IiIx)2 + (\u03c9IiIz)2,(\u03c9IiIx)2 +(\u03c9IiIy)2], rI=[ rIx rIy rIz ]T.

When the IMU rotates along the y-axis, the above two sets of installation error parameters will always have a coupling relationship. Similarly, the IMU rotates along the x-axis, The error propagation forms of the three groups of parameters \u03b4kaxy and \u03b4k g yx, \u03b4kaxz and \u03b4k g zx, \u03b4kazy and \u03b4kayz are respectively the same. When the IMU rotates along the z-axis, the error propagation forms of the \u03b4kayx and \u03b4kaxy are the same. Although there are 1\u20133 sets of coupling relationships in the installation errors of the gyro and the accelerometer during the horizontal rotation of the three sensitive axes of the IMU, such coupling relationships can be decoupled in turn through a specific indexing method. Except for the coupling term in the installation error, there is no error term in the same propagation form during the horizontal rotation of the three sensitive axes of the IMU. According to the error propagation form of each system-level self-calibration parameter, the longest error propagation period is 2\u03c0/\u03c9r (derived by Equation (17)). Based on the previous analysis, the rotation path of the self-calibration can be designed as Table 2 [15]:\nThe angular rotation rate is set as 20 \u25e6/s (the angular rate is not unique, usually 5 \u25e6/s to 20 \u25e6/s are commonly used), after finishing the last rotation, stay static until 1800 s to end the calibration process. In [15] the error parameters errors of IMU scale factors and biases are proved observable. Therefore, we need to analyze the observability of inner lever arms and accelerometer second-order factors in this study. Using the PWCS and SVD methods, the observability using the designed excitation path is shown as follows in Table 3."

As shown in Equation (19), the algorithm form of the reverse navigation algorithm is similar to that of the forward navigation. It only needs to invert the speed, the angular rate of the earth\u2019s rotation, and the stored gyro output, In the process of reverse navigation, due to the minus output of the gyroscope, the output of the gyroscope can be written as:\nF14 = \u2212Cnb [ Ngx I3\u00d73 [ 01\u00d72\nNgy I2\u00d72 ] [ 02\u00d71 Ngz ] \u2212I3\u00d73 ] (20)\nOther filter variables are consistent with the forward self-calibration filter model.

Therefore, this paper proposes a fast self-calibration algorithm architecture based on a backtracking scheme, the architecture is shown in Figure 2 as follows:\nThe 39D KF method is to decouple the error through the specified indexing sequence, to decouple the relationship between the navigation error and the IMU error, and use Kalman filtering to estimate. To ensure the linearity of the KF, we usually set initial calibration parameters at the beginning of the filtering process. The self-calibration filtering\nprocess-based backtracking scheme proposed in this paper makes full use of IMU information. Under the condition that the initial calibration parameters are set (inaccurate) (the coarse alignment is necessary, providing a coarse attitude can guarantee the linearity of the Kaman filter), the RINS can obtain an initial attitude after coarse alignment. The raw data of the IMU is stored at the same time. Then, utilize the attitude value after coarse alignment as the initial attitude value, utilize the stored gyroscope and accelerometer data to perform the reverse self-calibration process, and continue to store the IMU data. After the reverse filtering process end, the forward filtering process is performed from the initial moment, because the calculation rate of the self-calibration filtering process is faster than the rate of storing the data, and the final forward filtering process will end at time tcalib, which can catch up with the data stored in real-time and finally enter into the navigation process. Given the above explanations, the self-calibration based on the backtracking scheme can be summarized as follows:\n1. The information from the accelerometer and gyroscope are stored in the memory in real-time during the time period from the start (time 0) to the end (time tcoarse) of the coarse alignment stage of the dual-axis RINS, and the coarse alignment process ends at time tcoarse. We obtain attitude information with an acceptable error. 2. The process of reverse self-calibration filtering starts at the end of the coarse alignment of the dual-axis RINS (time tcoarse), and the process of reverse self-calibration filtering towards the start of the coarse alignment stage (time 0), using the stored gyro data, the angular velocity of the earth\u2019s rotation, and the reverse self-calibration The velocity at the initial moment of filtering needs to be negated. At the same time, in the process of reverse self-calibration filtering, the information of the gyroscope and accelerometer are still stored in the memory of the navigation computer. 3. After the reverse self-calibration filtering process ends, the program executes to the start time of the coarse alignment stage (time 0), and from this time onwards, the forward self-calibration filtering process is performed without modifying all the parameters of the Kalman filter used in the previous stage, the velocity at time 0 calculated using the reverse self-calibration filter needs to be reversed. At the same time, the stored gyro information and the Earth\u2019s rotation angular rate also need to be returned to the normal state from the previous inversion state (no need to invert). Since the calculation rate of the navigation computer is not fast enough to be ignored, the forward self-calibration filtering process needs to catch up with the stored time tcalib until. 4. The above three steps are the implementation process of the fast self-calibration algorithm based on backtracking navigation. At present, most navigation computers are equipped with large-capacity storage elements such as DDR2, SD card, etc., so that the online fast self-calibration algorithm of dual-axis RINS can be realized.\nIt should be noted that if the filter still does not fully converge after one round of retrospective filtering calibration, the next round of retrospective filtering and calibration can be performed. The reverse filtering process starts from the previous tcalib, and the subsequent process is the same as before."

            "text": "To verify the effectiveness of the proposed self-calibration method based on the backtracking scheme, we conduct a static test to evaluate the accuracy of the calibration parameters. The dual-axis we utilize in this study is shown in Figure 3. The dual-axis RINS realize the dual-axis turntable with 3D-IMU.\nThe structure of the dual-axis RINS is shown as follows Figure 4, and the IMU is installed inside the dual-axis turntable to realize the self-contained dual-axis RINS.\nThe gyroscope we use in the RINS is a laser ring gyro (RLG), the accuracy of the RLG is 0.003 \u25e6/h (100 s, 1\u03c3), with a 1 ppm (1\u03c3) of scale factor repeatability. The quartz accelerometers have an accuracy of 20 \u00b5g ( 1\u03c3). The sampling frequency of the IMU is 1000 Hz. To show the calibration process more clearly, the raw plot of the IMU is shown in Figure 5.\nThe RINS is fixed in a marble, the algorithm is implemented on the digital signal processer (DSP) chip. We use the method in reference to [10] as a comparison. The selfcalibration process lasts 30 mins (the backtracking process also lasts 30 min, with the same data). We use a high-accuracy three-axis turntable to calibrate the IMU parameters as reference [25], this method requires a high-accuracy turntable, the IMU needs to be removed from the dual-axis RINS, as the accuracy of the dual-axis turntable is not high enough (especially horizontal accuracy).The traditional method is described in [15] . The estimation curves of the IMU parameters are shown in Figures 6\u20139, the dotted line part is the reverse filtering process, and the solid line part is the forward filtering process.

The errors of gyro biases estimated by the traditional method are 0.02 \u25e6/h to 0.03 \u25e6/h, using the proposed method, the errors are only within 0.005 \u25e6/h. The errors of the gyro scale factors estimated by the traditional method are more than 4 ppm. Compared with the traditional self-calibration process, in a relatively short time, the method proposed in this paper achieves high estimation accuracy, which can verify the effectiveness of the proposed fast self-calibration method based on the backtracking scheme."

            "text": "In the field of the rotational inertial navigation system, many fields (land and aircraft) have put forward \u201cthree-self\u201d performance requirements, namely self-checking, self-alignment, and self-calibration. Although the traditional strapdown INS can realize self-checking and self-alignment, it cannot realize self-calibration. In response to such problems, dual-axis came into research, and the introduction of the dual-axis indexing mechanism fundamentally solved the problem of self-calibration without disassembly of IMU from the dual-axis turntable. Therefore, dual-axis RINS has received extensive attention in the field of land navigation. The accuracy of the calibration parameters can determine the navigation accuracy of RINS. The traditional self-calibration method needs several hours to converge. To shorten the self-calibration time by more than 50 percent, we propose a 39-dimensional online calibration Kalman filtering (KF) model to estimate all calibration parameters. Error relationship between calibration parameter errors and navigation errors are derived, which can be a theoretical guide for the design of calibration rotation path. A backtracking filtering scheme is proposed to shorten the calibration process. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can shorten the calibration process and improve the calibration accuracy simultaneously compared with the traditional self-calibration method.\nAuthor Contributions: J.L. designed and discussed the study, complied the models, conducted the analysis, and interpreted the results.
