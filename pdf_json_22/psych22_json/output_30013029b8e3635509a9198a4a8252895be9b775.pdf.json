Few studies to date have examined whether genetic risk for schizophrenia is associated with cannabis-related PLEs. Study Design: We tested whether measures of cannabis involvement and polygenic risk scores (PRS) for schizophrenia were associated with self-reported cannabis-related experiences in a sample ascertained for alcohol use disorders (AUDs), the Collaborative Study on the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA). We analyzed 4832 subjects (3128 of European ancestry and 1704 of African ancestry; 42% female; 74% meeting lifetime criteria for an AUD). Study Results: Cannabis use disorder (CUD) was prevalent in this analytic sample (70%), with 40% classified as mild, 25% as moderate, and 35% as severe. Polygenic risk for schizophrenia was positively associated with cannabis-related paranoia, feeling depressed or anhedonia, social withdrawal, and cognitive difficulties, even when controlling for duration of daily cannabis use, CUD, and age at first cannabis use. The schizophrenia PRS was\nmost robustly associated with cannabis-related cognitive difficulties (\u03b2 = 0.22, SE = 0.04, P = 5.2e\u22127). In an independent replication sample (N = 1446), associations between the schizophrenia PRS and cannabis-related experiences were in the expected direction and not statistically different in magnitude from those in the COGA sample. Conclusions: Among individuals who regularly use cannabis, genetic liability for schizophrenia\u2014even in those without clinical features\u2014may increase the likelihood of reporting unusual experiences related to cannabis use."

Some risk factors appear to make it more likely that cannabis users will report these PLEs, including early age of cannabis initiation,4 heavy cannabis use,6 and consumption of high-potency strains of cannabis.5\nRisk for cannabis use and schizophrenia is influenced by genetic factors, and genome-wide association studies (GWASs) and polygenic risk score (PRS) studies have shown that cannabis use and schizophrenia share genetic overlap.11\u201313 There is also evidence that genetic factors contribute to risk for PLEs,14\u201316 and studies have found that cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia (eg, disorganized thought patterns) show the most robust associations with polygenic risk for schizophrenia.17\u201319 Furthermore, a recent study from Wainberg et al.20 showed that the relationship between cannabis use and PLEs in the UK Biobank was moderated by a schizophrenia PRS, with cannabis use having a larger influence on the risk of PLEs for individuals with a higher genetic vulnerability for schizophrenia. It is plausible that individuals with greater polygenic vulnerability to schizophrenia may be particularly sensitive to the psychotomimetic and mood-altering effects of THC and thus, are at greater likelihood of experiencing schizophrenia-related symptoms after cannabis use\u2014including PLEs and cognitive difficulties. Empirical evidence on the association between genetic risk for schizophrenia and cannabis-related experiences, including paranoia, hallucinations, and cognitive difficulties, is scarce. Our study\nsought to understand whether genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, even in individuals without schizophrenia, could contribute to how individuals respond to cannabis.\nIn this study, we examined the extent to which genetic risk for schizophrenia is associated with 5 self-reported cannabisrelated experiences: hallucinations, paranoia, depression and anhedonia, cognitive difficulties, and decreased social contact. We used data from a sample partially ascertained for alcohol use disorders (AUDs)21\u201323 (74% of the analytic sample met lifetime criteria for AUD, while 70% met lifetime criteria for cannabis use disorder) and tested whether polygenic liability for schizophrenia was associated with cannabis-related experiences in individuals who reported using cannabis at least 11 times during their life."

PRS in European ancestry individuals from the COGA and CATS studies were calculated using summary statistics from the most recent Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) GWAS of schizophrenia (N = 306 011)30 https://www.med.unc. edu/pgc/download-results/) using PRS-CS31 (using the \u201cauto\u201d function).\nTo maximize prediction, we used a variation of PRS-CS, PRS-CSx32 (https://github.com/getian107/PRScsx) in the African ancestries subset of COGA. We used GWAS summary statistics from both the PGC GWAS of European ancestry and a GWAS meta-analysis of schizophrenia in African ancestry individuals33 (Ncases = 7509, Ncontrols = 8337, from the Cooperative Studies Program (CSP) #572 and the Genomic Psychiatry Cohort) to create metaanalyzed combined weights.\nWe also created a PRS for cannabis use disorder (CUD) in the European ancestry individuals in COGA using a \u201cleave-one-out\u201d version (N = 356 763) of a CUD GWAS11 that excluded the COGA sample. We only performed the leave-one-out analysis in the European ancestry GWAS, and thus only created PRS in the European ancestry subset of COGA, due to the severely limited statistical\npower of the African ancestry GWAS with the COGA sample excluded from the discovery GWAS (with COGA removed, remaining cases = 3035).\nThe PRS was scaled using the scale() function in R, such that the PRS followed a distribution with mean = 0 and variance = 1.\nRegression Models. In separate mixed effect logistic regression models, we tested whether age at first cannabis use, DSM5 cannabis use disorder (CUD) diagnosis,34 and maximum duration of daily cannabis was associated with cannabis-related experiences, controlling for sex, age, genotyping array, lifetime use of any other illicit substances (including hallucinogens, stimulants, sedatives, opioids), and 10 genetic ancestry principal components as fixed effects, and for family ID as a random intercept. We also tested whether these risk factors were associated with reporting at least 1 of the 5 cannabis-related experiences (hereafter referred to as \u201cany\u201d cannabis-related experience). Next, we tested whether the schizophrenia PRS was associated with cannabis-related experiences; we controlled for the same covariates as above, and CUD diagnosis (a binary variable) as another fixed effect. Statistical analyses were conducted in R.35\nWe conducted several secondary analyses: first, we tested whether the PRS for schizophrenia was associated with the severity of CUD diagnosis and whether CUD severity predicted greater endorsement of cannabis-related experiences. We also tested whether age at first cannabis use influenced the associations between the schizophrenia PRS and cannabis-related experiences. Given the ascertained nature of the COGA sample, we also tested whether controlling for AUD diagnosis influenced associations. Given prior evidence of genetic overlap between schizophrenia and CUD,11,36 we also tested whether including a PRS for CUD in the model attenuated associations between the schizophrenia PRS and cannabisrelated experiences. For cannabis-related experiences that were nominally associated (P < .05) with the schizophrenia PRS, we tested whether there were significant interactions between the schizophrenia PRS and duration of daily cannabis use, age of first cannabis use, or CUD. We controlled for all moderator-by-covariate and PRSby-covariate cross-terms37 but did not control for CUD in interaction analyses of duration or age of first use. Finally, we also tested whether the schizophrenia PRS was associated with the use of illicit substances, or with the number of cannabis-related experiences endorsed.\nDue to potential cross-ancestry differences in linkage disequilibrium patterns and minor allele frequencies, we calculated PRS and analyzed the initial regression models in each ancestry group separately to avoid possible confounding. To maximize sample size and power, we then used a fixed-effects model to meta-analyze these results across the European and African ancestries.38 We corrected for a total of 61 tests (details in\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /schizophreniabulletin/article/49/3/778/6955782 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 17 January 2024\nonline supplementary materials). Using a conservative Bonferroni correction, we consider P-values < .05/61 = 8.2e\u22124 to be statistically significant.\nReplication in the CATS sample25 was carried out using regression analyses that controlled for CUD, opioid use disorder (ascertainment criterion), lifetime use of illicit drugs other than cannabis, age, sex, and the first 9 genetic principal components. To assess differences in findings across the COGA and CATS samples, we used the following formula to calculate a z score for each outcome: Z = |\u03b2COGA \u2212 \u03b2CATS| / \u00bb( SECOGA2 + SECATS2 ) , where\n\u03b2COGAis the association between the schizophrenia PRS and the outcome in COGA, and SECOGAis the standard error of the regression coefficient."

Between 12% (hallucinations) and 31% (decreased social contact; table 2) of the sample endorsed a cannabis-related experience with 46% reporting experiencing at least 1 of the 5 cannabis-related experiences. There were few significant differences between the European and African ancestry samples (online Supplementary materials). There were very minor to no differences in endorsement in those who were assessed with the SSAGA I vs those who were assessed with later SSAGAs (eg, the largest difference was for cognitive difficulties, which was endorsed by 23% of those who were assessed with SSAGA I vs 26% of those who were assessed\nwith other SSAGAs.) In the CATS replication sample, 81% of individuals had a lifetime diagnosis of opioid use disorder (further details in supplementary table 1).\nPhenotypic correlations between the 5 cannabis-related experiences ranged from 0.51 (between hallucinations and depression/anhedonia) to 0.84 (between cognitive difficulties and depression/anhedonia; supplementary figure 1) in COGA. Correlations were slightly lower in the CATS replication sample (0.37\u20130.64; supplementary figure 1). Overall, the hallucinations item showed the lowest correlations with the other 4 cannabis-related experiences in both samples.\nIn meta-analyzed cross-ancestry findings from the primary regression models, lifetime CUD diagnosis was strongly associated with reporting cannabis-related experiences (P < 8.3e\u221226; table 3). Similar associations were noted for earlier age at first cannabis use and cannabis-related experiences (P < 2.2e\u22124). Duration of daily cannabis use was significantly associated with all experiences (P < 2.9e\u22125) except hallucinations and paranoia. We also found that CUD severity (as coded in the DSM-5: mild, moderate, severe, or none) was strongly associated with endorsement of a greater number of cannabis-related experiences (ANOVA F-statistic = 783.1 (3, 3039.1), P < 2e\u221216 in the European ancestry sample; F-statistic = 351.7 (3, 1639.0), P < 2e\u221216 in the African ancestry sample; note: degrees of freedom are not always integer values because they were estimated using Satterthwaite\u2019s method of approximation).\nIn models that controlled for CUD, the schizophrenia PRS was significantly associated with all cannabis-related experiences (maximum P < 6.8e\u22124) except hallucinations (P = .47; figure 1; table 4). The association between the schizophrenia PRS and reporting any cannabis-related experience did not pass our statistical significance threshold (P = .001), but the schizophrenia PRS was associated with endorsing a greater number of cannabis-related experiences\nTable 2.

Associations between the schizophrenia PRS and cannabis-related experiences were attenuated but still significant when controlling for age at first use, except for paranoia, which no longer passed our statistical significance threshold (P = 8.5e\u22124; supplementary table 2). Similarly, previous associations were still significant when controlling for AUD diagnosis except for the association with cannabis-related paranoia (P = .001; supplementary table 3). When we controlled for a PRS for CUD in the models, none of the associations with the schizophrenia PRS were attenuated (supplementary table 4; note, this sensitivity analysis was only performed in the European ancestry subset of COGA). None of the interactions between the schizophrenia PRS and duration of daily cannabis use passed our significance threshold of \u03b1 = 9.8e\u22124 (P > .42). The same was true for interactions between the schizophrenia PRS and age at first cannabis use (P > .01) and between the schizophrenia PRS and CUD\nTable 3.

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "The current findings suggest that heavy and early-onset cannabis users are more likely to report unusual cannabisrelated experiences and that higher genetic vulnerability to schizophrenia may place regular cannabis users at even greater risk for these experiences, especially cognitive difficulties. Even accounting for aspects of cannabis involvement, including polygenic risk for CUD, the schizophrenia PRS was significantly associated with all cannabis-related experiences except for hallucinations. This suggests a role for genetic vulnerability to schizophrenia in cannabisrelated experiences, even in those without psychotic disorders. Interestingly, we find that accounting for a PRS for CUD does not dampen the associations between the PRS for schizophrenia and cannabis-related experiences, suggesting that these cannabis-related experiences are more strongly related to genetic liability for schizophrenia in this sample. Despite nonsignificant effects in the replication models, the magnitude of association for the schizophrenia PRS was comparable (supplementary table 6), implying that the much smaller sample size for CATS is the primary factor behind the null results in this replication sample. Notably, these findings are from samples that were partly ascertained for AUD or opioid use disorder and generally had high levels of other substance use; therefore, these results may not generalize to the overall population.\nIn COGA, there was especially robust support across ancestries for an association between the schizophrenia PRS and cognitive difficulties (meta-analyzed beta = 0.22, SE = 0.04, P = 5.2e\u22127). This is consistent with previous studies which have found that schizophrenia PRS are associated with increased disorganized symptom scores and lower cognitive ability,17,18 while weaker associations are reported with other symptom domains. In the European ancestry sample, we created a categorical variable representing quartiles of polygenic risk for schizophrenia; when we regressed cognitive difficulties on this categorical variable of risk, we found that individuals in the top 25% of polygenic risk for schizophrenia had 2 times greater odds of reporting cognitive difficulties after using cannabis, relative to individuals in the lowest quartile of risk (supplementary figure 2). We note that while this may seem like a large increase in risk, there is great uncertainty in PRS models and individual-level prediction is unlikely to be accurate. Of the 5 cannabis-related experiences studied in this report, hallucinations were the least common and the least strongly correlated with the other reported experiences (supplementary figure 1). This is consistent with most reports of cannabis-related PLEs, which more often implicate delusions, paranoia, and cognitive dysfunction than hallucinations.7,8,40,41\nWe found little evidence to support multiplicative interactions between the schizophrenia PRS and duration of daily use or age at first cannabis use (supplementary table\n5). However, we note that the ascertained nature of the COGA sample and the fact that the overwhelming majority of individuals who endorse cannabis-related experiences in COGA have met the criteria for a lifetime CUD diagnosis (eg, 98% of individuals who report cognitive difficulties have met criteria for a CUD diagnosis) may have influenced our findings. The exclusion of individuals with schizophrenia, by study design, may also have impacted our results. It is likely that this range restriction (ie, few individuals who report cannabis-related experiences without heavy cannabis use and few individuals at the highest end of the spectrum of risk for schizophrenia), coupled with a small sample size, limited our statistical power to identify interactions. It is worth noting that the strongest interaction effect observed, which suggested that polygenic liability for schizophrenia has a greater effect on risk for any cannabis-related experiences in individuals with a CUD diagnosis, was actually stronger in the model that controlled for all covariate-by-PRS and covariate-by-CUD interactions37 compared to the model without these terms (beta = 0.43, SE = 0.14, P = .003 vs beta = 0.29, SE = 0.12, P = .01). Our primary interaction models were on the multiplicative scale, a test of whether the combined effect of the PRS and moderator differs from the product of their individual effects. However, in light of these null findings, we subsequently tested interactions on the additive scale, which tests whether the combined effect of the PRS and moderator differs from the sum of their individual effects. Some have argued that departures from additivity may be more meaningful biologically than multiplicative models.42,43 Supporting this theory, several of the interactions were stronger in the additive models (eg, PRS-byage at first use predicting cognitive difficulties P = .004, PRS-by-CUD predicting cognitive difficulties P = .0011), though none of the interaction effects passed our statistical significance threshold (\u03b1 = 9.8e\u22124). Our findings are most consistent with a multifactorial model,44,45 wherein polygenic risk for schizophrenia combines additively with environmental risk factors, including early and heavy cannabis use, to increase an individual\u2019s vulnerability to unusual cannabis-related experiences. Relatedly, while we found that CUD severity and polygenic risk for schizophrenia were both associated with the endorsement of a greater number of cannabis-related experiences, the schizophrenia PRS and CUD severity were not related, suggesting that these factors independently contribute to the risk of cannabis-related experiences in this sample.\nThere were few statistically significant differences in the prevalence of cannabis-related experiences across ancestries: self-reported cannabis-related paranoia was more common in the African ancestry sample than in the European ancestry sample, while cannabis-related social withdrawal was more commonly reported in the European ancestry sample. While there was no difference in associations with the measures of cannabis\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /schizophreniabulletin/article/49/3/778/6955782 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 17 January 2024\ninvolvement (table 3), the schizophrenia PRS was more weakly associated with cannabis-related experiences in the African ancestry subsample of COGA relative to the European ancestry subsample, a divergence supported by significant heterogeneity tests in the metaanalysis of 2 of the 4 significant outcomes (table 4). One potential explanation for this divergence is the relatively small sample size of the African ancestry GWAS. While multi-ancestry methods like PRS-CSx have been shown to improve the predictive power of PRS in diverse samples,32 these methods still fall short of having a large, fully ancestry-matched discovery GWAS to construct SNP weights for PRS.46 It may also be the case that the relative importance of different risk factors (eg, readiness to report hallucinations and other PLEs47\u201349; the likelihood of living in an urban area50,51; and the cumulative effects of racism and discrimination52\u201354) for cannabis-related experiences varies across these 2 ancestry groups in COGA. However, our study was not designed to address this question; more studies of cannabis-related psychosis risk in multi-ancestry samples and large-scale discovery of GWAS in non-European ancestries are needed.\nOur findings should be viewed with some limitations in mind. First, it is unclear how the timing of the self-reported cannabis-related experiences relate to the period of heaviest cannabis use, limiting causal inferences that can be drawn from our data. Second, although these experiences were self-reported to have occurred \u201cbecause of\u201d one\u2019s marijuana use, assessments were retrospective, and it is unclear how tightly these experiences were temporally linked to cannabis use. We cannot determine whether individuals were acutely intoxicated when these experiences occurred. We did not have data available on the persistence of these experiences, nor whether they were considered distressing. However, the polygenic risk for schizophrenia was associated with a greater number of cannabis-related experiences endorsed (meta-analyzed beta = 0.11, SE = 0.02, P = 1.3e\u22126); this provides some evidence that genetic risk for schizophrenia is associated with greater severity of cannabis-related experiences as indexed by a greater number of experiences endorsed. Third, we analyzed a variable assessing duration of daily cannabis use\u2014selfreported the longest period of time an individual used marijuana almost every day\u2014but this may not be an ideal measure of the heaviness of use. Beyond limitations associated with self-report, this measure does not capture quantity nor potency, and any \u201cnoise\u201d captured by this variable may have contributed to its weaker associations with cannabis-related experiences. Fourth, no data on the potency of cannabis used was available, and there is evidence that the ratio of THC to cannabidiol can vary widely in available cannabis across the US55,56; there is a possibility that varying levels of cannabis potency and THC:cannabidiol ratio could have affected\nour results. Fifth, we only examined the genetic risk for schizophrenia, but some of the cannabis-related experiences analyzed\u2014psychosis, anhedonia, and social withdrawal\u2014are common features of other disorders, including bipolar disorder and depression, for which we did not examine polygenic liability. Sixth, while individuals with psychotic disorder diagnoses were excluded from the COGA cohort,21 new onsets of psychotic disorders may have been missed as the SSAGA does not evaluate these diagnoses. However, these are expected to be rare. Finally, the cannabis-related experiences were only queried in individuals who reported using cannabis at least 11 times (or 21 times in a year) in SSAGA assessments. Thus, our subsample excludes any individuals who may have had these experiences at lower levels of cannabis use.\nIn conclusion, we found that polygenic liability for schizophrenia was associated with an increased risk of cannabis-related paranoia, depression and anhedonia, decreased social contact, and cognitive difficulties, even when accounting for the effects of other pertinent risk factors including CUD, age at first use of cannabis, and lifetime use of other illicit substances. As noted above, our findings come from ascertained samples with a high prevalence of CUD and use of other substances; thus, it is unclear whether these findings will generalize to population-based samples. Our results support the hypothesis that individuals who have a preexisting genetic vulnerability for schizophrenia are more likely to report unusual experiences, especially cognitive difficulties, when using cannabis."
