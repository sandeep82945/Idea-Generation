    "abstractText": "Despite growing interest in cognitive interventions from academia and industry, it remains unclear if working memory (WM) training, one of the most popular cognitive interventions, produces transfer effects. Transfer effects are training-induced gains in performance in untrained cognitive tasks, while practice effects are improvements in trained task. The goal of this study was to evaluate potential transfer effects by comprehensive cognitive testing and neuroimaging. In this prospective, randomizedcontrolled, and single-blind study, we administered an 8-week n-back training to 55 healthy middle-aged (50\u201364 years) participants. State-of-the-art multimodal neuroimaging was used to examine potential anatomic and functional changes. Relative to control subjects, who performed non-adaptive WM training, no near or far transfer effects were detected in experimental subjects, who performed adaptive WM training. Equivalently, no training-related changes were observed in white matter integrity, amplitude of low frequency fluctuations, glucose metabolism, functional and metabolic connectivity. Exploratory within-group comparisons revealed some gains in transfer tasks, which, however, cannot be attributed to an increased WM capacity. In conclusion, WM training produces transfer effects neither at the cognitive level nor in terms of neural structure or function. These results speak against a common view that training-related gains reflect an increase in underlying WM capacity. Instead, the presently observed practice effects may be a result of optimized task processing strategies, which do not necessarily engage neural plasticity.",

Transfer effects are training-induced gains in performance in untrained cognitive tasks, while practice effects are improvements in trained task. The goal of this study was to evaluate potential transfer effects by comprehensive cognitive testing and neuroimaging. In this prospective, randomizedcontrolled, and single-blind study, we administered an 8-week n-back training to 55 healthy middle-aged (50\u201364 years) participants. State-of-the-art multimodal neuroimaging was used to examine potential anatomic and functional changes. Relative to control subjects, who performed non-adaptive WM training, no near or far transfer effects were detected in experimental subjects, who performed adaptive WM training. Equivalently, no training-related changes were observed in white matter integrity, amplitude of low frequency fluctuations, glucose metabolism, functional and metabolic connectivity. Exploratory within-group comparisons revealed some gains in transfer tasks, which, however, cannot be attributed to an increased WM capacity. In conclusion, WM training produces transfer effects neither at the cognitive level nor in terms of neural structure or function. These results speak against a common view that training-related gains reflect an increase in underlying WM capacity. Instead, the presently observed practice effects may be a result of optimized task processing strategies, which do not necessarily engage neural plasticity.\nTranslational Psychiatry (2022) 12:512 ; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41398-022-02272-7"

            "heading": "INTRODUCTION",
            "text": "Working memory (WM) is the ability to retain temporary access to a limited amount of information in the service of ongoing cognitive processing [1]. The amount of accessible information is determined by WM capacity, which varies considerably between individuals [2]. WM capacity is closely correlated with other higher-order cognitive functions such as fluid intelligence, abstract reasoning, and reading comprehension [3]. This association motivated the development of cognitive training interventions targeting WM capacity in order to broadly improve general cognitive performance [4\u20137] and to counteract cognitive deficits in patient populations [8\u201310]. Moreover, WM training is a common component of cognitive training programmes that attract an increasing attention of major industry [11]. In the context of WM training, the concept of cognitive transfer is of key importance. Transfer effects are training-induced gains in performance in untrained cognitive tasks. Most previous theoretical accounts attributed transfer effects to training-induced increases in WM capacity, that is, a gain in the number of information elements that can be held accessible at the moment. Thus, transfer effects are an index of the putative effectiveness of WM training [12]. Transfer is categorized through the similarity between training and transfer tasks; the more similar the transfer\ntask to the training task, the \u201cnearer\u201d the transfer. Hereafter, we refer to cognitive improvements in the trained task as practice effects, improvements in contextually highly similar WM tasks as nearest (sometimes also referred to as direct) and gains in dissimilar WM tasks as near transfer effects. Improvements in other yet related cognitive domains such as reasoning is referred to as far transfer. The main goal of WM training is to produce far transfer effects that could manifest in improved skills of daily functioning. The prospect of broadly improving cognitive performance through WM training has given rise to an increasing number of WM training studies published each year (Fig. 1). Meta-analyses averaging effects of training on WM tasks with varying similarity have reported significant near transfer effects, e.g., [13, 14]. However, more recent meta-analyses that distinguished between nearest and near transfer effects found significantly greater effect sizes for the former, suggesting that WM training may mainly yield task-specific transfer rather than a general improvement in WM [5, 15]. Regarding far transfer, meta-analyses have yielded inconsistent conclusions. For example, the meta-analysis of Au et al. [16] reported a small, but significant positive transfer effect on fluid intelligence in healthy young adults. However, subsequent meta-analyses did not find any significant far transfer\nReceived: 3 December 2021 Revised: 23 November 2022 Accepted: 28 November 2022\n1Department of Nuclear Medicine, School of Medicine, Klinikum Rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany. 2TUM-Neuroimaging Center (TUM-NIC), Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany. 3Department of Neuroradiology, School of Medicine, Klinikum Rechts der Isar, Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany. 4Institute of Medical Psychology, Ludwig-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t, Munich, Germany. 5Department of Psychology, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, UK. \u2709email: igor.yakushev@tum.de\nwww.nature.com/tpTranslational Psychiatry\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 () ;,:\neffects [5, 13, 17], especially when the effects of WM training were compared with an active control group, that is, a group practicing tasks with little WM demands. The presence or absence of an active control group has been proposed as a key reason of the discrepant findings [6]. Furthermore, differences in the classification of cognitive tasks, training intensity, and type of training tasks have been discussed as potential reasons of the inconsistencies in previous findings (for a more detailed discussion, see von Bastian & Oberauer [7]). In addition to variations across training regimes, the validity of the assessment of cognitive outcomes has been criticized, too (e.g., [18]). Specifically, measurement noise and impurity of cognitive tasks may mimic or obscure true underlying changes in cognitive abilities. Whereas a passive (or no-contact) control group accounts for test-retest effects, only an active control group accounts for nonspecific training effects such as engaging regularly in a computerized task, expectancy, and placebo effects [7]. Moreover, practicing WM tasks can also trigger cognitive changes in domains different to WM capacity, such as attention and visual integration [19], or the development of task- or material-specific expertise [20]. Therefore, to resolve the controversies around the effectiveness of WM training, it is essential to discriminate between transfer driven by increased capacity in the trained domain such as WM capacity, and by enhanced use of the existing capacity [7]. This distinction is possible by including an active control group. Neuroimaging complimentary to cognitive assessments has the potential to pick up training-induced neural plasticity, which can be assumed to constitute the basis of sustained cognitive improvement. Specifically, neuroimaging might depict evidence of neural plasticity that precedes measurable changes in cognition [21]. Furthermore, acquisition of both neuroimaging and cognitive markers potentialy offers a more comprehensive picture of the process under the study. Neural plasticity is a blanket term for acquired or learned changes in neural oscillations, myelin reformation, and synaptogenesis [22\u201324]. These processes can be indirectly measured, for example using functional magnetic resonance (fMRI), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), and positron emission tomography with F18-fluordesoxyglucose (FDG-PET). The different forms of neural plasticity may occur simultaneously, and neuroimaging methods can provide only rough proxies of these changes at the macroscopic level [25]. Because it is still unknown which neuroimaging modality is most sensitive to traininginduced neural plasticity, we followed an exploratory multimodal approach in this study. So far, most imaging studies of the neural substrates of cognitive gains induced by WM training have used task-related fMRI. However, many such studies focused on neural correlates of practice rather than transfer effects (for a review, see ref. [26]). Moreover, to the best of our knowledge, only one study has\ninvestigated effects of WM training on the magnitude of intrinsic neural activity at rest [27]. The authors found increased activity in the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, frontopolar area, and medial prefrontal cortex. Recently, the focus of neuroimaging studies has moved from voxel-wise analyses of signal amplitude to network-wise analyses, with resting-state networks (RSN) becoming particularly popular. Yet, only two fMRI studies have investigated resting-state functional connectivity changes in relation to WM training [28, 29]. Using a priori defined ROIs or networks of interest, these two studies reported connectivity changes, both increases and decreases, within and between regions of the frontal parietal and the default mode network (DMN). However, neither of these studies used an active control group nor did their analyses cover the whole brain. Similarly, only a few studies have investigated changes in structural connectivity, that is, neural tracts, following WM training [30\u201333]. Results indicated training-associated changes in frontal and parietal white matter tracts [30, 33] or the corpus callosum [31]. Takeuchi et al. [32] reported that WM training increased the mean diffusivity in regions of the dopaminergic system. Finally, although some FDGPET studies investigated neural correlates of mental exercise [34\u201336], no such PET study exists in conjunction with WM training. This is surprising given that the concept of neurometabolic coupling underlying FDG-PET [37] is thought to be mediated by changes in neuro-glial energy pathways that support synaptogenesis or synaptic plasticity (for a review see ref. [38]). The goal of this study was to investigate cognitive and neural effects of an 8-week adaptive n-back training intervention in healthy middle-aged participants. N-back training is one of the most extensively studied forms of WM training [5]. Importantly, a meta-analysis reported a trend for n-back being the most efficient WM training [13]. We focused on middle age due to the clinical relevance of this age group. Specifically, middle age directly precedes aging that is associated with a number of cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer\u2019s disease. Yet, different to older adults, healthy middle-aged subjects typically have no significant atrophy or vascular pathology that might otherwise interfere with WM-related neural plasticity [39]. Therefore, should the current WM training programme prove effective, it might serve as an intervention in older adults to delay subsequent age- or diseaseassociated cognitive decline. To control for expectancy and nonspecific cognitive intervention effects, we compared n-back training to an active control training with low cognitive demand. We used state-of-the-art hybrid PET/MRI equipment for simultaneous acquisition of MRI and PET data at baseline and after WM training. All neuroimaging data were analyzed at the whole-brain level using both voxel- and network-wise approaches. Given the above literature, we expected to find at least near transfer effects and to detect changes at least in fMRI-RSNs as\nFig. 1 Number of studies published annually in the past decade.

            "text": "All participants underwent supervised training on a personal computer at home. Training in both the experimental and the active control group consisted of variants of visual and verbal n-back tasks. In these tasks, participants were presented a sequence of stimuli and were asked to identify a target stimulus. Targets were stimuli matching the stimulus shown n positions back (Fig. 2). Each stimulus was presented for 500ms followed by a 2000 ms interstimulus interval. Participants were instructed to press the \u201cA\u201d key in response to target stimuli. The experimental group performed adaptive visual and verbal n-back tasks adapted from Jaeggi et al. [40]. In each training session, participants completed 9 blocks per task (18 training blocks in total). Each block included a randomized sequence of 6 targets and 14 non-target stimuli. Task difficulty (i.e., the n positions that targets had to be matched against) was adapted to the individual performance based on the proportion of correct responses computed as a sum score of hits (i.e., correctly detected targets) and correct rejections of non-targets. The n-back level of the subsequent block increased if the proportion of correct responses was greater than 90% and decreased if it was lower than 80%. Otherwise the nback level remained the same. The adaptive level of n ranged from 1 to a maximum difficulty level of 9. Only one participant reached the 9-back level, indicating the absence of a ceiling effect at the group level. The active control group performed a non-adaptive low-level training intervention with visual (X-back) and verbal (1-back) tasks with task\nstructures and stimuli equivalent to the adaptive n-back training tasks. In the X-back task, participants had to press the \u201cA\u201d key whenever a target shape was presented. Hence, the X-back task demanded primarily attentional processing but no working memory. The same target shape was shown at the beginning of each block in all training sessions. The verbal 1-back task was identical to the adaptive verbal n-back task except that the level of n remained at 1 regardless of individual performance. Like the experimental group, the active control group completed 9 blocks of each task in each session, with each block consisting of sequences of 6 target and 14 non-target stimuli for the visual X-back task, and 6 targets and 14 non-target stimuli in the verbal 1-back task. The order of tasks trained (visual or verbal) was counterbalanced between participants within each group. Each training session took approximately 20min. Participants were instructed to complete four training sessions per week and one training session per day. After each training session, logfiles were automatically uploaded to the Millisecond Software website (https://www.millisecond.com/). Based on information saved in the logfiles, a weekly training progress report was sent via email to all participants. In case of irregularities in training behaviour, e.g., incompleteness of training sessions, we reminded the participant to follow the training instructions carefully."

Before the first cognitive assessment, each task was explained by an experimenter, and the participants completed a few practice trails in the presence of an experimenter. Each cognitive assessment lasted approximately 80min. Three tests were used to assess nearest transfer effects to untrained WM measures: Digit Span test for verbal WM (forward and backward version; subtest from HAWIE-R); Simple Visual Reaction Time (SVRT) task for motor response velocity and attention [41], and Corsi-Block Tapping test for visual WM [42]. Performance assessment was based on scores for each subtest of the Digit Span test, on a mean latency value from the SVRT task, and a block span of the Corsi-Block Tapping test [43]. Near transfer effects to tasks measuring attention and learning were assessed using visual Simon task (VST, [44]) and Colour Word Stroop task (CWST, [45]). For both near transfer tasks, we recorded correct responses for incongruent and congruent trials separately. Simon task trials were categorized as congruent if location of the stimulus was equivalent to location of the response key on the laptop and incongruent if locations of the stimulus and the response key were opposite. Colour Word Stroop task trials were categorized as congruent if meaning of the word and its colour aligned and incongruent otherwise. In addition, we administered a shortterm memory test (Verbaler Lern- und Merkf\u00e4higkeitstest, VLMT, [46]) and a sustained attention test (Rapid Visual Information Processing, RVIP, [47]). For the VLMT, we analyzed three dependent variables: difference in the number of correct answers between the recall before and after\nTranslational Psychiatry (2022) 12:512\npresentation of the interference list (Dg5-Dg6), difference in the number of correct answers between the recall before and 20\u201330min after presentation of the interference list (Dg5-Dg7), and scores from the Word Recognition List (WR). For the RVIP, we analyzed the proportion of correct target detections. To assess far transfer effects to fluid intelligence and decision-making, we used a short version of the Raven\u2019s Advanced Progressive Matrices Test (short-APM, [48], and the Iowa Gambling Task [49], respectively. Performance in the short-APM was scored by the number of correct responses, whereas performance in the Iowa Gambling Task was ranked by the net score (good play\u2013bad play). The Digit Span task and VLMT were presented orally, whereas the other tests were administered on a PC with an in-house adaptation of the Millisecond website test library (Inquisit 5; retrieved from: https:// www.millisecond.com). The short-APM was coded in the Inquisit programming language. The Digit Span forward requires the participant to repeat digits in the same order as presented by the examiner. A minimum length of three and a maximum length of nine digits are presented. The Digit Span backward requires the participant to repeat the digits in the reverse order as presented by the examiner. Here, a minimum of two and a maximum of eight digits is presented. The number of digits increases when the participant correctly repeats at least one out of two trials."

DTI data were pre-processed using the University of Oxford\u2019s Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain Software Library (FSL) version 6 (http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/index.html). PET images were spatially normalized into the MNI space using a study-specific FDG-PET template, followed by smoothing with an 8mm isotropic Gaussian filter. The first three images of the fMRI data were discarded. Data preprocessing included motion correction, coregistration of the subjects\u2019 T1-weighted image to the functional images, spatial normalization to the MNI space using DARTEL, and smoothing with an 8mm isotropic Gaussian filter. Excessive head motion was defined as translation >3mm or rotation >3\u00b0 [51]. The amplitude of low frequency fluctuations (ALFF) analysis was carried out using Data Processing Assistant for Resting-state fMRI (http://rfmri.org/ dpabi) and SPM12. The pre-processed and smoothed rsfMRI data (see above) were further processed using linear de-trending, nuisance regression (i.e., white matter signal, cerebrospinal fluid signal, 6 motion parameters and their first derivatives) and band-pass filtering (0.01\u20130.08 Hz) to remove low-frequency drifts and other high-frequency physiological noises. Then, ALFF maps were calculated as described previously [52]. In brief, the filtered time series were transformed into the frequency domain with fast-Fourier transform. Then, the square root of the power spectrum was computed and averaged at each voxel. Following a visual inspection, passed DTI images were corrected for susceptibility-induced distortions, eddy currents, subject movement, and signal dropout using the tool Eddy [53]. Brain tissue was derived using the brain extraction tool (https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/BET). Images of\nfour subjects, three experimental and one control, had to be excluded from further DTI analyses due to an incorrect phase encoding direction.

Additionally, radial diffusivity (RD) maps were created by averaging the L2 and L3 maps. Individual FA maps were spatially normalized to the MNI space. A mean FA map was used to compute an average white matter tract skeleton using a threshold of FA > 0.2. Finally, Tract-Based Spatial Statistics as implemented in FSL was conducted for FA, MD, AD, and RD maps."

Individual fMRI time-series images were concatenated for the group ICA using the Infomax algorithm [54]. We chose a 30 component ICA model, as this intermediate model order delivers robust and coherent RSNs [55]. We applied the resulting spatial maps as reference templates for the spatially constrained ICA applied to the FDG-PET data. Hereby, a concatenation of one PET image per participant was used for the group ICA [56\u201358], while employing the same brain mask as for fMRI ICA. Further details on the spatially constrained ICA for the FDG-PET data can be found in the Supplementary Materials. We focused our analyses on the following (neurocognitive) networks of interest a priori: anterior and posterior DMN, salience network (SN), and left and right central executive network (CEN). The auditory network was chosen as reference network, as it was assumed to be unaffected by visual and verbal n-back training."

            "text": "Indices were calculated both for fMRI- and FDG-PET-based RSNs. For the fMRI data, we calculated a multiple regression against the group-derived component maps using the function \u201cicatb_multipleRegression\u201d of the GIFT toolbox. This analysis returned a beta-coefficient (\u03b2) value for each component of interest in each participant, reflecting the degree to which the spatial pattern of each participant\u2019s particular network explained the spatial pattern of the equivalent group-derived network. For this computational step, we used a z-threshold of 1 for the reconstructed participant-specific component maps [59]. For the FDG-PET data, we extracted so called loading coefficients [58, 59]. These are the mixingmatrix entries of A from the generative model x = As that separate different signals [60, 61]. These values were read out from the estimated \u201ctimecourse\u201d file, with each timepoint representing one participant (see above). Loading coefficients close to zero represent a high spatial overlap between each participant\u2019s RSN and the equivalent group-derived RSN. Finally, indices of network integrity were available for each participant, network, and imaging modality [59]. Potential WM training effects on network integrity were analyzed with a two-way mixed-effects analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measures using the between-subjects factor group (CON, EXP) and the within-subjects factor time (T1, T2) in SPSS 19.0 (IBM Corporation, Somers, NY). We considered results as statistically significant at p < 0.05 after Bonferroni correction, i.e., 0.05/6= 0.008 for six networks of interest.\nStatistical analyses of the training data We used in-house written Python 3 scripts to analyze the training data. In the experimental group, we studied the mean n-back level achieved in each session (experimental group only) and the d prime (both training groups). Based on signal detection theory, d prime is calculated as the difference between the hit rate and the false alarm rate [62]. For the control group, we analyzed only d prime, since those participants performed at the same low n-back level throughout training. Because the last three sessions of one participant in the experimental group and two last sessions of one participant in the control group were lost, we interpolated the missing data with their own previous training data using a forward linear method. Assumptions of normality were rejected for the nback training data (all p-values < 0.05 in Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test). Therefore, to assess practice effects, we performed a two-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test between the mean of the first four and the mean of the last four training sessions for d prime, separately for each group and WM training modality (i.e., visual and verbal). In addition, we computed a\nTranslational Psychiatry (2022) 12:512\ntwo-sided Wilcoxon signed-rank test between the mean of the first four and the mean of the last four sessions for n-back level values for the experimental group separately for each training modality (i.e., visual and verbal).\nStatistical analyses of the cognitive test battery Assumptions of normality were tested using a one-sample Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov test. As primary analysis, we conducted a group (CON, EXP) by time (T1, T2) multivariate ANOVA for each transfer category (i.e., nearest, near, far). In case of a significant group x time interaction per category, we performed a post hoc ANOVA for this category. Results were considered as statistically significant at p < 0.05 with Bonferroni correction, that is, 0.05/4= 0.0125; 0.05/15= 0.003; 0.05/2= 0.025 for 4, 15, and 2 tests for nearest, near and far transfer, respectively. ANOVA is known to be robust to not normally distributed data with an equal sample size [63]. In addition, we computed two-sided paired t-tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests (depending on the distribution) for all cognitive tests within the experimental and control group (Table 3). Results were considered as statistically significant at p < 0.05 with Bonferroni correction, that is, 0.05/ 21= p < 0.002 (for 21 tests). All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS 19.0 (IBM Corporation, Somers, NY). Moreover, we analyzed cognitive data assessing transfer effects with Bayesian statistics. The Bayesian analysis quantifies confidence in a model in the face of the data. The Bayes factor is the comparison of posterior likelihoods of competing models. Bayes factors are the relative posterior likelihood of the data under one model (such as the null) against a competing model (such as the alternative). The advantage of this approach is that, unlike null-hypothesis significance testing, Bayes factors are informative about whether there is sufficient evidence to accept or reject one model over the other, or whether further data collection is needed [64]. The Bayes factor is a ratio with its magnitude (ranging from 0 to \u221e) providing a continuous measure of the strength of evidence in favour of the numerator model over the denominator model. Taking the reciprocal of a Bayes factor gives the strength of evidence in favour of the denominator model. A Bayes factor of 1 reflects perfectly ambiguous evidence (i.e., the data is not sufficiently sensitive to distinguish between the two hypotheses), with larger Bayes factors representing stronger evidence. Conventionally, Bayes factors below 3 are deemed as reflecting ambiguous evidence. We replicated the frequentist analysis with Bayesian t-tests and ANOVAs where appropriate. The null and alternative models were specified with prior probability distributions, which quantify one\u2019s beliefs under the model over different effect sizes before observing the data. We used a set of widely accepted default priors for t-tests [65] and ANOVAs [66]. For ANOVAs these were: fixed effects: r= 0.5, random effects: r= 1, scale covariates: r= 0.354. For ttests, the priors were: Cauchy prior with scale = 0.707. The analysis was run using JASP (JASP team, 2021). We reported the model averaged Bayes factors across matched models, with subscripts indicating which model was the numerator (1= alternative, 0 = null). Evidence for or against transfer was assessed using the model-averaged Bayes factor for the twoway interaction between group and time.\nStatistical analyses of the imaging data For the ALFF and FDG-PET data we conducted ANOVA with the betweensubjects factor group (CON, EXP) and the within-subjects factor time (T1, T2) using the full factorial model in SPM12. For the FDG-PET data grandmean scaling and global calculation using SPM\u2019s global mean were applied. A p < 0.05 familywise error corrected at a voxel-level was set as the significance threshold. To analyze the DTI data voxel-wise, we applied permutation-based statistics using the randomize function in FSL [67]. The random permutation number was set at 5000, and we considered results as statistically significant at p < 0.05 threshold-free cluster enhancement, again corrected for multiple comparisons at a voxel-level. Two-way mixedeffect ANOVA for repeated measures was conducted with the between-\nsubjects factor group (CON, EXP) and the within-subjects factor time (T1, T2) for FA, MD, AD, and RD maps. For explorative reasons, we also present all results with an uncorrected p < 0.001 with a cluster extent threshold of 50 for the voxel wise analyses of the ALFF, FDG-PET data, and TBSS."

In the active control group, d prime did not significantly differ between the beginning and the end of verbal n-back training or visual n-back training. In the multivariate ANOVA, a significant group \u00d7 time interaction was found only for the nearest transfer effect category (F(4,50) = 5.3, p < 0.013). Follow-up univariate analysis of variance revealed a significant group \u00d7 time interaction for the Digit Span forward test, Table 2. The experimental group showed a significant improvement in the Digit Span forward test at T2 compared to T1, Table 3. Subjects in both groups showed quicker reaction times in the Visual Simon task (VST) at T2 compared to T1. Here, the experimental group improved in the incongruent trials (RTincong), whereas the control group improved both in congruent and incongruent trials. Based on the Bayesian statistics, we found decisive evidence for nearest transfer effects to the forward digit span (BF10= 182.42). Strong evidence from simple-effects analysis suggests that this was driven by a change in the experimental group (BF10= 18.53) rather than in the control group (BF10= 1.87). There was relatively weak evidence against transfer to the Corsi task (BF01= 3.77). For near transfer, there was relatively weak evidence against transfer to the VLMT (BFs01: 2.75\u20133.66). For the RVIP, there was weak evidence against transfer in accuracy (BF01= 3.71), and ambiguous evidence for transfer in RTs (BF01= 1.98). For all measures of the VST and Stroop task, there was at least ambiguous evidence in support of the null (all BFs01 > 1.54). Finally, there was ambiguous evidence against transfer to the short-APM (BF01= 1.78) and weak evidence against transfer in the Iowa Gambling Task (BF01= 3.99).\nVoxel-wise analyses of the ALFF and PET data The group \u00d7 time interaction was not significant in both analyses.

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "Following 8-week n-back training, neither near nor far transfer effects were detected in middle-aged adults, despite the presence of significant practice effects. Consistently, there were no significant changes in comprehensive analyses of multimodal neuroimaging data. Given the inconsistent literature about transfer effects, we designed our study to address common limitations of the previous studies. To the best of our knowledge, the present work provides the most comprehensive assessment of neural correlates of WM training and transfer effects reported so far. Specifically, instead of relying on a single surrogate index of neural plasticity, we assessed five neuroimaging-based markers, at a voxel and network level. Along with testing cognitive changes with a broad test battery, this comprehensive and consistent pattern of results allows for stronger inferences than the previous studies. Second, as the mechanisms of transfer are still unclear, we isolated WM transfer effects from non-specific intervention effects by including an active control group. Specifically, because the control training was a non-adaptive version of the experimental WM training paradigm, we were able to distinguish transfer effects driven by training-induced WM gains from performance gains due to the acquisition of task-specific or stimuli-specific expertize, including material-specific strategies and learning. Third, we tested and closely supervised a larger-than average sample [69] of a typically neglected age group using an intensive, adaptive home-based intervention. Fourth, we evaluated transfer effects in cognition by combining two statistical approaches, frequentist and Bayesian statistics, thereby providing not only dichotomous information\nabout the significance of effects, but also a continuous measure for the strength of evidence. Fifth, to reduce the likelihood of false positives, we rigorously corrected for multiple testing. Finally, with explorative purposes, we also analyzed the neuroimaging data using liberal significance thresholds without correction for multiple tests.\nLack of evidence for transfer effects In line with the results of the numerous studies, we found significant practice effects in the experimental group. Significant transfer effects were present only in one subtest of the nearest transfer category, the Digit Span forward. These effects were accompanied by strong Bayesian evidence. There was no corresponding improvement even in the Digit Span backward, a closely related subtest with the same stimuli. Neither near nor far transfer effects were detected. Of note, by transfer effects, we explicitly refer to improvements in an experimental group relative to an active control group. This definition allows the isolation of any cognitive gains specifically due to adaptive n-back training. Thus, WM training-related gains appear to generalize to performance in other WM tasks only to a very limited degree. Moreover, the gains are generalizable neither within the same domain nor to other cognitive domains.\nLack of evidence for neuronal plasticity in the neuroimaging data To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study of WM using multi-modal neuroimaging including PET. Surprisingly, there are few investigations of the neural substrates of WM training. Different from the present study, in which we did not detect any changes in ALFF or glucose metabolism after WM training, Takeuchi et al. reported increased brain activity in the dorsal prefrontal cortex following WM training [27]. However, the authors did not include an active control group and, therefore, these changes could reflect test-retest or non-specific intervention effects. So far, only two studies have explored an impact of WM training on RSN connectivity, with findings of both increased and decreased connectivity within the DMN, as well as between the DMN and central executive network (CEN) [28, 29]. Here, we did not find any robust training-induced changes in the DMN, CEN or other established neurocognitive RSNs. Only exploratory post hoc\nFig. 3 Training results for the experimental group. A d prime mean values per session, B n-back level mean values per session; data are shown as mean \u00b1 SEM.\nTranslational Psychiatry (2022) 12:512\ntests revealed reduced integrity of the aDMN in the experimental group. However, this observation did not survive multiple correction or contrasting against the active control group. Notably, neither of the past studies included an active control group. While there has been no TBSS study on the effects of WM training, a few research groups have explored effects of this kind of training on white matter integrity using voxel-based morphometry or an ROI analysis [30\u201333]. They reported training associated-changes in frontal and parietal white matter tracts [33], corpus callosum [31], in regions of the dopaminergic system [32], and in the superior and inferior longitudinal fasciculus [30]. However, in line with our resting-state fMRI and FDG-PET results, we found no significant effects of WM training on white matter integrity. Again, the above studies included either no control group [33] or a passive control group only [31, 32].\nThe need for an active control group As discussed elsewhere (e.g., [7]), there are large methodological differences between WM training and transfer studies, for\nexample, variations in training tasks (e.g., n-back vs. complex span tasks), training conditions (duration and frequency), and age of participants. However, the key factor contributing to the inconsistent findings in previous behavioural and neuroimaging studies is the presence and type of a control group (passive or active). Critically, meta-analyses that explicitly distinguish between the types of a control group typically report a lack of far, sometimes also near, transfer effects [5, 15, 17]. Alternative interventions administered to active control groups can either involve entirely different activities, such as completing questionnaires rather than cognitive tasks (e.g., [70]), adaptive cognitive tasks that differ from the experimental group but follow the same adaptive procedures, such as adaptive visual search training (e.g., [20]), or, as in the present study, non-adaptive versions of the experimental training intervention. Adaptive alternative interventions arguably control better for motivational appeal and believability than non-adaptive alternative interventions (see also ref. [18]); however, administering non-adaptive active control training allows for keeping the tasks and materials\nWMT effects\nTests WMT group Active control group Interaction group \u00d7 time Bayes factors statistics\nPre M (SD) Post M (SD) Pre M(SD) Post M (SD) F P (\u03b72) BF\nNearest transfer (3)\nDigit Span\nForward 7.79(2.15) 8.82(1.7) 7.52(2.2) 7.00(1.8) 16.97 <0.0001 (0.243)* 182.42a\nBackward 6.75(1.3) 7.46(2.1) 7.11(2.4) 7.63(2.5) 0.11 0.75 (0.002) 3.46b\nCorsi 46.1(16.5) 47.68(16.5) 44.1(19.1) 44.7(16.4) 0.04 0.85 (0.001) 3.77b\nSVRT\nM-latency 286.71(32.1) 306.32.(48.6) 292.64(50) 287.58(42.2) 6.16 0.02 (0.104) 3.31a\nNeartransfer (4)\nVLMT\nDg5\u20136 1.68(1.7) 2.11(2.9) 1.04(1.8) 1.00(1.4) 0.38 0.54 (0.007) 3.13a\nDg5\u20137 1.25(1.6) 1.14(1.7) 0.70(1.5) 0.96(1.2) 0.64 0.43 (0.012) 2.75a\nw-f 12.64(2.5) 12.93(2.3) 13.44(1.5) 13.89(1.5) 0.09 0.76 (0.002) 3.66a\nRVIP\nAccuracy 18.04(7.3) 20.79(5.0) 16.52(9.0) 19.89(5.7) 0.11 0.74 (0.002) 3.71b\nRT 523.97(76.12) 531.44(66.7) 508.63(83.2) 493.3(66.5) 1.39 0.24 (0.026) 1.98b\nCWST\nRT-cong 1344.4(272.5) 1253.2(2643.) 1336.4(271.9) 1312.7(305.9) 1.21 0.28 (0.022) 2.16b\nRT-incong 1600.1(286.7) 1506.1(320.2) 1531.1(292.9) 1537.4(304.9) 1.67 0.20 (0.031) 1.83b\nRT-neutral 1266.5(221.7) 1191.3(233.3) 1228.8(237.2) 1234.9(265.5) 2.04 0.16 (0.037) 1.62b\n%-cong 0.996(0.01) 0.988(0.03) 0.994(0.02) 0.996(0.01) 1.86 0.18 (0.034) 1.55b\n%-incong 0.939(0.07) 0.931(0.07) 0.950(0.06) 0.948(0.05) 0.09 0.76 (0.002) 3.99b\n%-neutral 0.983(0.04) 0.990(0.03) 0.998(0.01) 0.995(0.01) 1.14 0.29 (0.021) 2.39b\nVST\nRT-cong 454.63(59.1) 426.72(57.2) 447.49(63.0) 406.56(80.0) 0.99 0.32 (0.018) 2.42b\nRT-incong 505.13(64.9) 471.1(59.6) 492.74(71.8) 451.43(76.0) 0.56 0.46 (0.010) 2.97b\n%-cong 0.98(0.04) 0.99(0.02) 0.96(0.1) 0.98(0.02) 0.67 0.42 (0.012) 2.7b\n%-incong 0.963(0.04) 0.966(.03) 0.953(0.1) 0.943(0.06) 0.31 0.58 (0.006) 3.63b\nFartransfer (2)\nShort- APM 5.64(2.30) 6.79(2.44) 5.26(2.49) 5.67(2.47) 1.99 0.16 (0.036) 1.78b\nIGT 6.21(8.32) 11.43(10.88) 5.46(3.19) 9.91(16.74) 0.03 0.87 (0.000) 3.99b\nNotes: WMT working memory training, M (SD), mean (standard deviation), Corsi Corsi-block Tapping test; SVRT simple visual reaction time task, M-latency mean latency, RVIP the rapid visual information processing task, Accuracy= hits \u2212 FA; RT (ms), mean reaction time for correct responses in millisecond, CWST the colour-word stroop task, RT-cong mean reaction time for congruent condition, RT-incong mean reaction time for incongruent condition, RT-neutral mean reaction for neutral condition, %-cong percent correct for congruent condition, %-incong, percent correct for incongruent condition, %-neutral percent correct for neutral condition, VST visual Simon task, Short-APM, the short version of Raven\u2019s Advanced Progressive Matrices Test; IGT Iowa Gambling Task, independent variable here is net score. *significant at p < .05 Bonferroni corrected, BF bayes factors; abayes factor in favour of H1 over H0; bbayes factor in favour of H0 over H1.

Specifically, the higher the similarity between active control and experimental group training, the more stringent the control of transfer gains driven by task- or material-specific expertize when contrasting the groups over time (see also ref. [71]). In the present study, we chose a non-adaptive control group to allow for isolating transfer effects due to traininginduced increases in WM capacity from improvements in WM efficiency due to the acquisition of task- or material-specific expertise. In a recent meta-analysis by Sala at el. [4] 8 out of 43 reviewed studies assessed transfer and included a control group performing the same tasks as the experimental group. Critically, no transfer effects were observed in 3 out of 8 studies [72\u201374], and only nearest transfer effects as measured with digit span forward and/ or backward were observed by three other studies [19, 75, 76]. Near and far transfer effects were reported only by Brehmer et al. [77] for the PASAT task requiring sustained attention and by Simon et al. [78] for the Digit Symbol task requiring psychomotor ability, sustained attention, processing speed and, to a lesser degree, WM. Of note, these are two transfer tasks that we did not\ninclude. Similar findings were reported by Aksayli et al. [79], who evaluated the effects of adaptive Cogmed WM training, a commercial training programme, relative to non-adaptive Cogmed training. The authors reported a consistent lack of far transfer, small to medium effects sizes for near transfer and that these transfer effects depended on the similarity of the transfer tasks to the WM training paradigm. This is in line with our results, supporting the view that WM training-related gains appear to generalize to performance in other WM tasks only to a very limited degree. Indeed, when exploring within-group changes from pretest to post-test, we observed significant gains in all three transfer categories, including far transfer, although these did not survive correction for multiple tests. Importantly, however, the experimental group did not improve over and above the changes observed in the control group. Surprisingly, we also observed a decline in the Digit Span Forward (nearest transfer) in the control group, which may have contributed to the only significant transfer effect in the main analysis. This implies that both training interventions, no matter how specific they have been designed, can trigger performance improvements which are not due to an\nTable 3.

These strategies are likely paradigm-specific and, thus, could be applicable to both the experimental and active control group, thereby also explaining the cognitive improvements in the control group. In this context, we propose the term\npseudo-transfer effects to describe such gains that are unrelated to increases in WM capacity and also not accompanied by strong neuroplastic effects as measured by, for instance, DTI. This explanation is in line with the only nearest transfer effect that we observed in the experimental group contrasted against the active control group. As there was no transfer to any other task, it is highly unlikely that the effect was driven by increased WM\nTable 4.

Instead, we argue that the observed improvement in the forward Digit Span, a measure of verbal short-term memory, more likely is a pseudo-transfer effect imparted by co-engagement of short-term memory and acquisition of effective strategies during adaptive n-back training. As transfer effects within and between cognitive domains were shown to be of equivalent magnitude when comparing different WM training paradigms (e.g., n-back training and complex span training) [81], it is reasonable to assume that our results are generalizable to other WM training paradigms. Overall, the present results, in particular on the neuroimaging side, may serve as a useful reference for future cognitive training studies not only in healthy individuals, but also in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. While patients with affected WM and neuroimaging indices of brain health at baseline might potentially have more space for gains then healthy subjects, commonly coexisting attention deficits and disease-related deterioration of neural plasticity may limit efficiency of WM training in patients. We suggest that future training studies should target multiple cognitive domains beyond WM and include neuroimaging techniques beyond fMRI, DTI, and FDG-PET."

            "text": "In this prospective, randomized, actively controlled, and singleblind study, we provide strong and consistent evidence for the absence of near and far transfer effects following 8-weeks of adaptive WM training in healthy middle-aged adults, despite a pronounced improvement in the n-bask training task. Repeated multimodal imaging revealed no training-induced changes in resting state fMRI, DTI, and FDG-PET data. More specifically, comprehensive analyses of putative markers of neuronal plasticity in terms of white matter integrity, BOLD signal, and glucose metabolism, at a voxel and network level, failed to discover significant alterations. We propose the term \u201cpseudo-transfer effects\u201d to characterize gains in a trained task, resulting from co-engagement of non-targeted cognitive domains and/or improved efficiency in using the targeted cognitive capacity due to acquisition of new strategies. Critically, we argue that such pseudo-transfer effects do not reflect increases in WM capacity. Instead, the presently observed practice effects may be a result of optimized task processing strategies, which do not necessarily engage neural plasticity.\nFig. 5 Integrity of fMRI-based networks.
