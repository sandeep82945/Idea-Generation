Using this publicly-available code (https://github.com/tjlcbakx/ redshift-search-graphs), we discuss scenarios where robust redshifts can be identified using both singleand multiple-line detections, as well as scenarios where the redshift remains ambiguous, even after the detection of multiple lines. Using the redshift distribution of (sub)mm samples, we quantify the efficiencies of various practices for measuring spectroscopic redshifts, including interferometers, as well as existing and future instruments specifically designed for redshift searches. Finally, we provide a method to optimise the observation strategy for future (sub)mm spectroscopic redshift searches with the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array, where 2 mm proves indispensable for robust redshifts in the z = 2 \u2212 4 region.",

            "text": "Since their discovery in the 1990\u2019s (e.g., Smail et al. 1997; Hughes et al. 1998), the extreme star-formation rates of sub-millimetre galaxies (SMGs) have been difficult to square with our picture of galaxy evolution (see e.g., Blain et al. 2002; Casey et al. 2014). Their strong emission in sub-mm wavelengths implied star-formation rates in excess of 1000M /yr, approaching or exceeding the limits of stable galaxy systems through excessive feedback (Rowan-Robinson et al. 2016), while their strong dust-obscuration poses serious challenges to large-scale unbiased follow-up attempts across all wavelengths (Ivison et al. 2016; Casey et al. 2018; Donevski et al. 2018; Duivenvoorden et al. 2018; Bakx et al. 2020a; Reuter et al. 2020). Such large-scale unbiased follow-up is crucial, as studies find SMGs to consist of a diverse population (e.g., Fardal et al. 2001; Baugh et al. 2005; Lacey et al. 2008; Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2011; Narayanan et al. 2015). A first step towards such follow-up requires precise and robust redshift measurements. Unfortunately, photometric redshifts from sub-mm colours remain only indicative of a redshift range (e.g., Casey et al. 2012; Pearson et al. 2013; Ivison et al. 2016; Bakx et al. 2018; Casey 2020) due to the degeneracy between dust temperature and redshift (Blain et al. 2003). Redshifts derived from spectroscopic lines break this degeneracy. The first redshift searches used optical spectral lines, however they struggled with the positional uncertainty of SMGs andwith a limited bandwidth. Radio observations improved the positions, but provide a strong bias towards lower redshifts, and are not workable for large, complete redshift samples (e.g., Chapman et al. 2005). Instead, redshift searches using (sub)millimetre spectroscopy are unhindered by dust extinction and can be related\n\u2605 E-mail: bakx@a.phys.nagoya-u.ac.jp (Nagoya University)\nunambiguously to the (sub)millimetre source, offering a far better alternative to optical spectroscopy and to the imprecise sub-mm photometric method (e.g., Wei\u00df et al. 2009). The (sub)mm spectroscopic method has only become competitive with the increased bandwidths of the receivers operating at mm and sub-mm facilities, as for example demonstrated by Vieira et al. (2013) and Wei\u00df et al. (2013), who presented the first redshift survey for 23 strongly-lensed dusty star-forming galaxies selected from the South Pole Telescope (SPT) 2500 deg2 survey using the Atacama LargeMillimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) at 3 mm. The large uncertainties of photometric redshifts and the lack of discerning spectral features of (sub)mm spectral lines (i.e., unlike the resonant, a-symmetric emission from Ly\ud835\udefc) complicate the spectroscopic redshift determination. Instead, the process of robust redshift determination at (sub)mm wavelengths, in particular using rotational emission lines from carbon-monoxide (CO), involves the careful comparison between the potential redshift solutions of individual lines, and then selecting the solution where multiple lines agree. This method is far from ideal, as it leads to confirmation bias for solutions close to the \ud835\udc67phot (Yanai & Lercher 2020), and fails to draw attention to redshift degeneracies. Similarly, sometimes redshift solutions can be excluded if we fail to detect additional spectral lines within the bandwidth. In this paper, we expand on the graphical method from Bakx et al. (2020c) which provides a more user-friendly method for identifying robust redshifts. This method is capable of highlighting redshift degeneracies, and enables the easy removal of untenable redshift solutions, similar to graphicalnumerical puzzles, such as the Sudoku1 puzzle.

The low-redshift scenario would detect CO(2-1) and CO(3-2), while the higher-redshift solution involves CO(4-3) and CO(6-5). Such scenarios occur when the ratio of the upper transition (Jup) of both CO line transitions can be multiplied to form another set of integer numbers. In this case, the common multiplier is two, however extensive possibilities exist. We can quantify the change in redshift between a scenario where we either detected CO(\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4e \u2212 1) for one redshift solution or CO(\ud835\udc4f, \ud835\udc4f \u2212 1) for the other redshift solution as\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201310 (2021)\nfollows \u0394\ud835\udc67 1 + \ud835\udc67 = \ud835\udc4f \u2212 \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc4e .

In case the photometric redshift of a line agrees with a solution of CO(\ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4e\u22121), the photometric redshift can thus identify how many standard-deviations (\ud835\udc41) we are offset from a solution at CO(\ud835\udc4f, \ud835\udc4f\u22121) using\n\ud835\udc41 [\ud835\udf0e] \u2248 \ud835\udc4f \u2212 \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc4e \u00d7 0.13 .

These are typically restricted to CO lines, since the correlation between CO lines and [C i] emission strongly depends on the particular ISM conditions (see e.g., Valentino et al. 2018). CO lines transitions, instead, are strongly correlated to one-another through transitional partition functions following so-called spectral line energy distributions (SLEDs). The Milky Way CO SLED has a sharp drop-off in velocity-integrated fluxes for Jup transitions greater than 3, however for star-bursting galaxies, these SLEDs can approach the maximum thermalized profile, where velocity-integrated fluxes increase with \ud835\udc3d2 (see Carilli & Walter 2013). In the case of Fig. 1, we know the undetected CO lines should\nbe at least on the same order of brightness as the detected lines, as their transitions are in between the detected emission lines. For the single-line case in Fig. 3, the \ud835\udc67spec = 2.2 case would have, in the most unfortunate case, a CO(3-2) line with an integrated flux of \u223c 56% (= 32/42) fainter than the detected line. Similarly, for the higher-redshift solution at \ud835\udc67spec = 3.8, the CO(5-4) would be \u223c 70% (= 52/62) as bright as the detected line. We show this analysis in graphical form in Figure 5. Taking into account measurement errors, as well as this line ratio, the exclusion method thus requires relatively-high signal-to-noise (> 8\ud835\udf0e) detections to be robust. In Figure 5 we show that such a 8\ud835\udf0e detection of a single spectral line is enough to exclude the potential redshift solution. We show the CO SLED of typical bright DSFGs from Planck-selected sources (Harrington et al. 2021), a CO SLED from theMilkyWay (Fixsen et al. 1996), and the maximum expected excitation from a thermalized profile. We choose the Planck-selected CO SLED because it traces a large range of CO-transtions, from CO(1-0) to CO(12-11), while still being broadly representative of the population of DFSGs. The Milky Way CO SLED represents typical low-excitation gas, with a steep drop-off, while the thermalized profile reflects the maximum expected excitation. For both the highand low-redshift possibilities, the upper-limit lies below the thermalized profile. As such, no typical SLEDwould be able to produce both a non-detection at a low-J, and a detection at a higher-J CO line."

By combining multiple spectral windows, interferometers can cover large redshift ranges while delivering high-resolution imaging of both line and continuum emission. However, the telescope array with the largest collecting area, ALMA, only offers a modest spectral coverage (up to \u223c7.75 GHz per tuning). While the necessary integration time to detect a line from, for example, a bright Herschel source is only several minutes, an ALMA-based redshift search could thus result in large overheads (\u223c 30 min.) due to the need to switch tunings. Generally, there are two ways around the large overheads. Firstly, ALMA offers the ability to observe sources close on the sky (typically \u223c 10 degrees of separation) without the need to recalibrate. Observations can then be carried out in batches of sources, reducing the overheads per source (see e.g., Urquhart et al. 2022). Secondly, ALMA recently started to offer2 spectral scans that calibrate all spectral windows on the calibrator, cutting down significantly on slewing overheads, which can amount to half or more of the total observing time.

This is a significant advantage when looking for redshifts, further aided by the wider bandwidths (up to \u223c 16GHz in one tuning, with possible expansion in the future) that allow for a wide 3 mm scan in just two tunings. In the 3 mm window, this would amount to an observation similar to the 3 mm scan in Figure 6, where one typically requires additional observations in the 2 mm band. Follow-up observations in the 2 mm band do not lend themselves for easy generalization, which is why we were not able to generate a similar plot for a NOEMA 3- and 2 mm redshift search, although simply covering the 3- and 2 mm windows similar to the Band 3 & 4 linescan suggest a near-complete redshift coverage of the HerBS and SPT samples alike using four tunings. Nevertheless, the graphical method of this paper (i.e., Fig. 1) can offer significant aid in determining additional observations at both 2 mm and other bands, while also highlighting redshift degeneracies."

At lower redshifts particularly, these observations require ancillary data \u2013 such as with IRAM or 8\u2212 10m telescopes \u2013 to confirm the redshifts robustly.

(2012), the higher-frequency transitions (often of CO lines) are not guaranteed. In this case, clever stacking of the line emission as a function of redshift enabled robust redshifts even though individual lines might be detected only at a few sigma. It is good to note that, unlike the RSR and Zpectrometer, the diameter of the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO) where the telescope operated was modest at 10 m, since high surface accuracy was needed given the higher-frequency observations."

This large collecting area is crucial, since the expected emission\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201310 (2021)\nfrom these low-excitation rotational transitions is faint (Harris et al. 2010). Observationally, the GBT/Zpectrometer set-up had another advantage to increase its efficiency. While performing on-off chopping to remove background and atmospheric noise, the telescope chopped between two galaxy positions. The emission line from the second (\u2019off\u2019) source would then be seen as a negative signal (Frayer et al. 2011; Harris et al. 2012). This method allows for the easy identification of redshifts between 2 and 3.5, as well as above 5. Interestingly, the typical uncertainty on photometric redshifts increases with redshift, going as \u223c 0.13 \u00d7 (1 + \ud835\udc67), the lower redshifts are basically robust (hatched blue), while the higher redshifts might be mis-interpreted CO(2-1) line emission that is instead CO(1-0)."

We carefully exclude frequency regions with strong atmospheric absorption from our analysis in Figure 6. As shown in detail in Rybak et al. (2021), the wide bandwidth at 1.4 to 0.7 mm means that DESHIMA will be sensitive to mid- to higher-J transitions for sources at \ud835\udc67 < 3.3. These emission lines vary strongly from source to source, however can be brought out through similar stacking as seen in Z-Spec (e.g., Lupu et al. 2012). Beyond \ud835\udc67 > 3.3, the [C ii] emission line will dominate the emission and will be readily detected.We note that the robust redshift coverage of DESHIMA at even the lowest redshifts is high, and DESHIMA could thus additionally be well-suited towards low-\ud835\udc67 spectroscopic redshift searches."

            "text": "We test the ability to include 2 mm spectral windows to improve the robust redshift coverage of ALMA. The proposed configuration uses a total of six tunings to generate two near-contiguous frequency coverages at both 3 and 2 mm, which removes the overlapping region of the 3 mm scan. The total figure of merit is determined not solely by robust redshifts (either through single- or multiple-lines), but we choose to additionally add non-robust redshifts, weighted down by 50%. Figure 8 shows the figure ofmerit for each possible combination of 3 and 2 mm regions on a smoothed redshift distribution similar to the HerBS targets (Bakx et al. 2018, 2020b), assuming a low uncertainty in the \ud835\udc67phot of \u0394\ud835\udc67/(1+ \ud835\udc67) \u2248 7%. Note that both the figure of merit, as well as the choice for the redshift distribution depend on the science case, and can be adjusted by the reader in the scripts provided online. The figure of merit varies between 0.83 to 0.94 for different combinations of the 3 and 2 mmwindow, with the optimum lying at the middle frequencies in band 3 (3 mm) and at higher frequencies in band 4 (2 mm), with the precise configuration shown in Table 1. The frequencies of the ALMA 12m array observations in Urquhart et al. (2022) were derived using a similar method. They report redshift search efficiencies similar to the ones suggested by Figure 8, with a robust redshift fraction of 72%, and promising to go up to 93% with deeper observations. While we demonstrate the efficacy of this method on ALMA, any redshift search with tunable\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201310 (2021)\n(sub)mm receivers can be optimised using this method through the publicly-available code."

The method provides highlights the explored redshift-space, enabling the removal of untenable redshift options, while also pointing out potential redshift degeneracies. A method to calculate the capabilities of various instruments towards deriving robust spectroscopic redshifts. This is useful, not only to evaluate past missions, but also to guide future instruments. A method to optimise tunings towards robust spectroscopic redshifts (and other figures of merit) for ALMA and other tunable (sub)mm receivers. Here, we stress the need for both 3 and 2 mm observations to identify redshifts robustly."
