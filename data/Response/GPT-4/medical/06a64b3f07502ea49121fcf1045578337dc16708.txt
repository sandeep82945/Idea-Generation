Integration of Multi-Modality Imaging Data: Future research could focus on integrating data from multiple imaging modalities (e.g., CT, MRI, PET scans) into AI algorithms for lung cancer detection. This approach could potentially improve the accuracy and robustness of lung cancer diagnosis by leveraging the complementary information available in different types of medical images.

Development of Real-time AI Diagnostic Systems: Investigate the feasibility and effectiveness of implementing AI-based diagnostic systems in real-time clinical settings. This would involve assessing the performance of AI algorithms in analyzing imaging data as it is acquired, potentially leading to faster diagnosis and treatment planning.

Exploration of AI in Lung Cancer Prognosis and Treatment Planning: Beyond detection and classification, there's a promising avenue in utilizing AI to predict patient outcomes, response to treatment, and survival rates. Research could focus on developing AI models that integrate imaging data with clinical, histological, and molecular data to guide personalized treatment plans.

Cross-population Validation and Adaptation of AI Models: Given the variability in lung cancer presentation across different populations, further research is needed to validate and adapt existing AI models across diverse demographic groups. This includes exploring the transferability of AI algorithms developed in one population to others and identifying any biases or limitations.

Investigating the Impact of AI on Clinical Workflow and Patient Outcomes: Future studies should assess how the incorporation of AI into the diagnostic process affects clinical workflow, including time to diagnosis, radiologist workload, and patient throughput. Additionally, research should evaluate the impact of AI-assisted diagnosis on patient outcomes, such as the accuracy of early-stage cancer detection, reduction in unnecessary biopsies, and overall survival rates.
