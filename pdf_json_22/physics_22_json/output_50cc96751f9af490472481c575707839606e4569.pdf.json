    "abstractText": "We study the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation on the half-line x > 0 with Neumann type boundary condition. Stationary measures of the KPZ dynamics were characterized in recent work: they depend on two parameters, the boundary parameter u of the dynamics, and the drift \u2212v of the initial condition at infinity. We consider the fluctuations of the height field when the initial condition is given by one of these stationary processes. At large time t, it is natural to rescale parameters as (u, v) = t(a, b) to study the critical region. In the special case a + b = 0, treated in previous works, the stationary process is simply Brownian. However, these Brownian stationary measures are particularly relevant in the bound phase (a < 0) but not in the unbound phase. For instance, starting from the flat or droplet initial condition, the height field near the boundary converges to the stationary process with a > 0 and b = 0, which is not Brownian. For a + b > 0, we determine exactly the large time distribution F stat a,b of the height function h(0, t). As an application, we obtain the exact covariance of the height field in a half-line at two times 1 \u226a t1 \u226a t2 starting from stationary initial condition, as well as estimates, when starting from droplet initial condition, in the limit t1/t2 \u2192 1.",

            "text": "The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation [1] in one dimension describes the time evolution of the height field h(x, t) of an interface which undergoes a local growth process driven by white noise. It is a paradigmatic element of a large universality class of one dimensional models with identical universal behavior at large scale, the so-called KPZ class. Since the interface is growing, with h(x, t) \u223c v\u221et at large time, it is intrisically an out of equilibrium problem. One can nevertheless ask whether a stationary state can be reached at large time. While the height at one point grows linearly in time with non trivial t1/3 fluctuations, the height difference between any two points, h(x, t)\u2212h(y, t), reaches a stationary distribution. Even when this distribution is known, it says nothing about the increments of the height field in time, say h(0, t) \u2212 h(0, 0). In this paper, we are interested in computing these temporal increments and their asymptotics at stationarity (i.e. starting from a stationary initial condition), and apply it to compute the two-time covariance of the height field.\nLet us first briefly review what is known about stationary distributions for the KPZ equation. They depend on whether one considers the equation on the full-line, or in a restricted geometry such as a half-line or an interval. On the full-line, it has been predicted for a long time [2,3] that the KPZ equation admits the Brownian motion (BM) with an arbitrary drift as a stationary measure. This was proved rigorously in [4], and in [5] for periodic boundary conditions. Interestingly, in the cases of the half-line and the interval, the generic situation is more complicated (not translation invariant, not Gaussian, see below). One typically imposes Neumann type boundary conditions (that is, one fixes the derivative of the height field at the boundary) so that stationary measures depend on boundary parameters. For the interval it depends on the two boundary parameters, while for the half-line it depends on one boundary parameter and on the drift at infinity. In the special case when boundary and drift parameters are such that the slope imposed at the origin has the same value as the drift at infinity, the BM (with the same drift) is again stationary, as was shown in the case of the half-line in [6] (this specific half-line stationary measure was studied in the equivalent directed polymer context in [7]). But this Brownian stationary measure is not unique, and for arbitrary values of the drift parameter, the stationary measures have been found only recently.\nFor the KPZ equation on an interval [0, L], an explicit formula for the Laplace transform (LT) of the stationary height distribution was obtained in [8] (for L = 1, and for some range of parameters). Explicit Laplace inversion was performed shortly after in [9]\nand [10] (see also [11]). In [10] a rather simple and explicit characterization of the process h(x, t) \u2212 h(x, 0) was obtained by two of the present authors. This characterization allowed in particular to predict the stationary measures in the limit of the half-line, letting the size of the interval to infinity. This large interval limit is actually quite non-trivial, but surprisingly, the limit of stationary measures on [0, L] had been already studied in the mathematics literature [12], with completely different motivations. This is why we refer below to the resulting processes on the half-line (i.e. the non-Brownian stationary distribution for KPZ in a half-space) as Hariya-Yor processes.\nLet us now describe in more details the question we address in this paper. While the steady-state distribution of h(x, t) \u2212 h(0, t) for the KPZ equation on the half-line x > 0 is now clear, it remains to understand the global height, that is the height at one point, for instance h(0, t). Apart from situations where the boundary is very attractive, already studied in [7], the height grows at large time as h(0, t) \u2243 v\u221et+ t1/3\u03c7, where \u03c7 is a random variable whose distribution depends on some details of the initial condition h(x, 0). For the KPZ equation on the full-line with a stationary, i.e. BM initial condition, \u03c7 follows the Baik-Rains distribution [13\u201316]. It is universal over the KPZ class and, remarkably, was measured in recent experiments on liquid crystals [17]. For the half-line, the corresponding question was addressed only recently, but until now only for the special case mentioned above where the BM (with drift) is still the stationary measure. The analog of the BaikRains distribution then depends on one boundary parameter, we denote it F Browniana , and it was obtained in [18] (in the context of last-passage-percolation, which is equivalent by universality) and in [6] directly for the KPZ equation for a = 0.\nThe aim of this paper is to obtain the analog of the Baik-Rains distribution for the KPZ equation on the half-line starting from a stationary initial condition in the generic case, that is for the Hariya-Yor initial conditions. We show in this paper that these Hariya-Yor processes are integrable, in the sense that one can write down simple exact formulas for the mixed exponential moments, using the framework of half-space Macdonald processes [19]. Through the usual Hopf-Cole mapping h(x, t) = log Z(x, t), the process Z(x, t) solves the multiplicative noise stochastic heat equation (that is the partition function of a continuous Brownian directed polymer in a random potential) and we compute explicitly all moments of Z(x, t) via a Bethe ansatz type approach. Following a similar line as in [6] (and previous works including [20,21]), we express the Laplace transform of Z(x, t) as Fredholm Pfaffians and determinants, which we analyze asymptotically to obtain the limiting distribution of \u03c7.\nIt is important to note that although our results are obtained from the large-scale analysis of the KPZ equation, we expect that they hold universally for all half-space models in the KPZ universality class. As an application, following a method introduced in [22] for full-space models, we have obtained the two-time covariance of the KPZ height in a half-line geometry. These results can also be translated in terms of the free energy of a directed polymer in the presence of a wall.\nOutline. In the following sections, we first review the stationary measures for the KPZ equation on the half-line (Section 1.2) and discuss the various distributions that arise for the large time fluctuations of the height field (Section 1.3). Our main new results are presented in Section 1.3.3. We then present an important application of the main results to the computation of two-time covariance in half-space KPZ growth in Section 1.4.\nThe remaining sections are devoted to details of the derivations. In Section 2, we obtain the moments and Laplace transform formulas characterizing the distribution of h(0, t). We analyze the formulas asymptotically in Section 3 and obtain explicit formulas\nfor the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the limiting distributions. We provide the details of computations of two-time covariance in half-space KPZ growth in Section 4. Finally, in Appendix A, we extend the results of our previous work [6] to provide an explicit formula for the CDF F Browniana when the boundary parameter a 6= 0. In Appendix B, we explain how to compute the distribution of h(x, t) instead of h(0, t), when x is scaled of order t2/3, and the initial condition is a Hariya-Yor processes."

It was noticed in [6] that if the initial condition x 7\u21927\u2192 hu(x, 0) is distributed as\nhu(x, 0) = B(x) + ux (3)\nthat is a Brownian motion with drift u, then for all t > 0, the process x 7\u2192 hu(x, t)\u2212hu(x, 0) has the same distribution, that is\nhu(x, t) \u2212 hu(0, t) (d) = B(x) + ux. (4)\nIn other terms, the Brownian motion with drift u is a stationary distribution for the KPZ equation in a half-space with boundary parameter u. In infinite volume (that is for dynamics on functions of R or R+), there is no reason to expect that the stationary process is unique. Indeed, there exist other, more complicated, stationary measures for the half-space KPZ equation, recently described in [10], based on results for the stationary measure on an interval from [8] (see also [9,11] for an equivalent description of stationary measures on an interval). These additional stationary measures depend on a parameter v, where \u2212v is the drift of the process at infinity, and they arise only when u > v, v 6 0. It is convenient to represent them on the diagram of Fig. 1, which explains which stationary processes arise in the large time limit, depending on the boundary parameter u and the drift of the initial condition. They are defined in terms of a process that we call the Hariya-Yor process, defined below and denoted HYu,v,\nFor u > v, v 6 0 with u + v > 0, we define the Hariya-Yor process, denoted1 HYu,v(x), by\nexp ( HYu,v(x) ) := w1\n\u222b x\n0 dteB1(t)+B2(x)\u2212B2(t) + w1w2eB2(x), (5)\nwhere B1, B2 are independent standard Brownian motions with drifts \u2212v and v respectively, and w1, w2 are independent inverse gamma random variables w1 \u223c Gamma\u22121(u+v)\n1our notations are different from [10], where a slightly different process was denoted HY\u2212vu (x))\nand w2 \u223c Gamma\u22121(u \u2212 v). We say that a random variable X follows the Gamma\u22121(\u03b8) distribution if 1/X is a Gamma random variable with scale parameter 1 and shape parameter \u03b8. In other terms, X is a positive random variable with density 1\u0393(\u03b8)1x>0x\n\u2212\u03b8e\u22121/x dxx . In order to give a unified description of the stationary measures, is is convenient to\ndefine, for any u, v \u2208 R, a stationary initial condition hstatu,v , where\nhstatu,v (x) =\n \n HYu,0(x) \u2212 HYu,0(0), for u > 0, v > 0, that is (u, v) \u2208 R1, B(x) + ux for u 6 0, v > u, that is (u, v) \u2208 R2, HYu,v(x) \u2212 HYu,v(0), for u > v, v 6 0, that is (u, v) \u2208 R3.\n(6)\nLet us stress that while in the phase u > v, v 6 0 the process hstatu,v (x) describes exactly the spatial increments of HYu,v(x), it is defined differently in the other phases and this is why we needed a new notation. We will use alternatively hstatu,v (x) and HYu,v(x) for the following reason: hstatu,v (x) is the natural way to describe the stationary height field, in particular it is normalized so that hstatu,v (0) = 0. The process HYu,v(x), however, is not normalized but contains the appropriate random shift that makes exact computations possible.\nRemark 1.1. The Hariya-Yor process (5) is defined only when u > v, v 6 0 with u+v > 0. It depends on a random variable w1 \u223c Gamma\u22121(u + v), which explains the condition u + v > 0. However,\nhstatu,v (x) = HYu,v(x) \u2212 HYu,v(0) = HYu,v(x) \u2212 log w1 \u2212 log w2\ndepends only on w2 \u223c Gamma\u22121(u \u2212 v), and on two Brownian motions B1, B2, hence it is well-defined for any u > v, v 6 0, without imposing the condition u + v > 0.\nRemark 1.2. For any u > 0,\nHYu,\u2212u(x) \u2212 HYu,\u2212u(0) = B(x) + ux (7)\nwhere B(x) is a standard Brownian motion. This is a nontrivial result, discovered by Hariya and Yor in [12].\nRemark 1.3. As v \u2192 u, it is easy to check that\nHYu,v(x) \u2212 HYu,v(0) ===\u21d2 v\u2192u B(x) + ux. (8)\nRemark 1.4. Our definition of HYu,v(x) may appear different from the process defined in [10, Eq. (35)] but it is equal up to a shift by log(w1w2). Indeed, the process is defined in [10] as\nH(x) = B(1)(x) + B(2)(x) + log ( 1 + \u03b3u\u2212v \u222b x\n0 e\u22122B (2)(z)dz\n) , (9)\nwhere B(1)(x), B(2)(x) are independent Brownian motions with variance 1/2 and drifts 0 and v respectively. Using the change of variables\nB(1) = B1 + B2\n2 , B(2) = B2 \u2212 B1 2 ,\nB1, B2 are two independent standard Brownian motions of drifts \u2212v and v respectively, and we have that, if we identify \u03b3u\u2212v in (9) with 1/w2 in (5), then\neH(x) = eHYu,v(x)\nw1w2 , (10)\nso that H(x) = HYu,v(x) \u2212 log(w1) \u2212 log(w2). (11)\nRemark 1.5. The integral (5) is similar to the partition function of the semi-discrete O\u2019Connell-Yor polymer [23, 24] with two rows. Other O\u2019Connell-Yor partition functions decorated by inverse Gamma variables appeared in the literature, [7, 16, 25], though the partition function in (5) is different. In the limit u \u2192 \u221e, we recover exactly the O\u2019ConnellYor partition function."

            "text": "1.3.1 Droplet initial condition. For the droplet initial condition, i.e. ehu(x,t) \u2192t\u21920 \u03b4(x), and boundary parameter u, a phase transition occurs based on the sign of u. We have\nlim t\u2192\u221e P\n( hu(0, t) + t12\nt1/3 6 s\n) =\n \n\nFGSE(s) for u > 0,\nFGOE(s) for u = 0,\n0 for u < 0.\n(12)\nIn the phase u < 0, the scaling and statistics are different: hu(0, t) \u2243 t ( \u22121 12 + u 2 ) [26] and statistics are Gaussian on the t1/2 scale (see [7,27]). If we scale u close to the critical point as u = at\u22121/3, we have that\nlim t\u2192\u221e P\n( hat\u22121/3 (0, t) + t 12\nt1/3 6 s\n) = F dropleta (s). (13)\nThe existence of a transition was anticipated in [26]. In the equivalent directed polymer problem, it corresponds to a transition to polymers bound to the wall at x = 0 when u < 0 to unbound polymers when u > 0. The statistics occurring around the phase transition\n(12) and the exact formula for F dropleta were first discovered in [28, 29] in the context of asymptotic fluctuations of symmetrized last passage percolation models. For the KPZ equation, these asymptotics were obtained in [30] for u = +\u221e, in [20] for u = 1/2, in [31] for a = 0 (i.e. the critical case, u = 0), and in [21, 27] in the general case. We have in particular F droplet0 = FGOE.\n1.3.2 Brownian initial condition. For a Brownian initial condition hu(x, 0) = B(x)+ ux, where B(x) is a standard Brownian motion, which is stationary for any u \u2208 R, we have for u = at\u22121/3\nlim t\u2192\u221e P\n( hat\u22121/3(0, t) + t 12\nt1/3 6 s\n) = F Browniana (s). (14)\nThis statement and an exact formula for F Browniana was obtained in [6] in the special case a = 0. In the context of last-passage percolation, the analogous statement for any a \u2208 R was shown earlier in [18]. We also provide in Appendix A an alternative formula for F Browniana , based on an extension of our earlier result for a = 0 in [6] (The formula for F Browniana (s) appears in (133)). It remains to be shown that the exact formulas from [32] and our formulas in [6] and Section A are equivalent. Note that in [18,32], formulas were also obtained for the height distribution and multipoint correlations at points away from the boundary.\nAccording to the phase diagram of Fig. 1, in the bound phase, i.e. when u < 0, for any initial condition with drift at infinity not exceeding \u2212u, the spatial process hu(x, t) \u2212 hu(0, t) should converge, as t goes to infinity, to a Brownian with drift u, hence the importance of this case. Consequences about the geometry of the polymer and the distribution of the endpoint were investigated in [7].\nIn the unbound phase u > 0 however, the stationary process obtained at large time is the Hariya-Yor process HYu,v, when the drift of the initial condition is positive and equals \u2212v > 0, and HYu,0 when the drift is negative. Brownian stationary measures arise only when u + v = 0, see Remark 1.2, which is a very special case. For droplet or flat initial condition for instance, the stationary process observed at large times is the Hariya-Yor process HYu,0. This makes the study of fluctuations starting from the Hariya-Yor initial condition particularly important in the unbound phase.\n1.3.3 Main new result: Hariya-Yor initial condition. We now focus on the regions R1 and R3. We assume that the initial condition hu(x, t) = log Z(x, t) is given by hu(x, 0) = HYu,v(x), for u > v, v 6 0 as defined in (5), under the additional technical assumption u + v > 0. We will show that, for u = at\u22121/3, v = bt\u22121/3, with a + b > 0, b 6 0\nlim t\u2192\u221e P\n( hat\u22121/3 (0, t) + t 12\nt1/3 6 s\n) = GHYa,b (s) (15)\nwhere the CDF GHYa,b (s) will be explicitly determined. An explicit formula for G HY a,b (s) is given in (78). When a > 0 and b = 0, that is in the maximal current phase, the formula simplifies and we obtain\nGHYa,0 (s) = \u2202s ( Det(I + A\u0303s) ( \u22122\na + s + 2R+\n)) , (16)\nwhere A\u0303s is an integral operator acting on L2(0, +\u221e) with kernel A\u0303s(x, y) = A\u0303(s + x + y) where\nA\u0303(x) = \u222b\ndz 2i\u03c0 a + z a \u2212 z e \u2212xz+ z 3 3 , (17)\nwhere the contour is a vertical line with real part between 0 and a, and R+ is a scalar product defined using quantum mechanical notations as (see Section 3.2 for details)\nR+ = \u30081| A\u0303s 1 + A\u0303s |1\u3009 . (18)\nRemark 1.6. As a \u2192 +\u221e, we notice that GHYa,0 (s) \u2192 F Brownian0 given in [6, Eq. (7.24)]. This limit is obvious from the formula but the reason is non-trivial, it can be seen as a consequence of a surprising identity in distribution obtained in [6, Sections 4.5 and 4.6], see more details in Remark 3.1. This identity in distribution itself comes from more general identities in distribution for the log-gamma polymer and half-space Macdonald processes found in [19, Prop. 2.6 and Prop. 8.1].\nThe distribution given by GHYa,b is not centered, unlike the Baik-Rains distribution or the distribution F Browniana , but this is an artefact due to our definition of the HariyaYor process. Indeed, under the scaling u = at\u22121/3, v = bt\u22121/3, limt\u2192\u221e t\u22121/3HYu,v(0) (d) = Ea+b + Ea\u2212b, where Ea+b and Ea\u2212b are independent exponential random variables with parameters a \u00b1 b. We can construct a centered variable as follows: we may write that\nlim t\u2192\u221e P\n( hat\u22121/3(0, t) \u2212 hat\u22121/3(0, 0) + t12\nt1/3 6 s\n) = F HYa,b (s) (19)\nwhere F HYa,b (s) is such that\nE [ F HYa,b (s \u2212 Ea+b \u2212 Ea\u2212b) ] = GHYa,b (s). (20)\nMore explicitly, this means that\nGHYa,b (s) = (a 2 \u2212 b2)\n\u222b +\u221e\n0 du e\u2212ua sinh(bu) b F HYa,b (s \u2212 u). (21)\nThis can be inverted as\nF HYa,b (s) = G HY a,b (s) + \u2202sG HY a,b (s) 2a a2 \u2212 b2 + \u2202 2 s G HY a,b (s) 1 a2 \u2212 b2 . (22)\nEquivalently, if we denote by \u03c7a,b a random variable with distribution GHYa,b and \u03bea,b a random variable with distribution F HYa,b , we have that (recall that we have assumed in this section that b 6 0, a + b > 0)\n\u03bea,b + Ea+b + Ea\u2212b = \u03c7a,b. (23)\nwhere \u03bea,b, Ea+b and Ea\u2212b are independent. By stationarity, we can argue that E [ \u03bea,b ]\n= 0. Indeed,\nE [ \u03bea,b ]\n= lim t\u2192\u221e\nt\u22121/3E [ hat\u22121/3(0, t) \u2212 hat\u22121/3(0, 0) + t\n12\n]\n= lim t\u2192\u221e\nt\u22121/3 \u222b t\n0\n( \u2202sE [ hat\u22121/3(0, s) \u2212 hat\u22121/3 (0, 0) ] +\n1 12\n) ds\nThe quantity inside the integral is independent of s, by stationarity, so it is a constant. This constant is necessarily 0, otherwise we would have that limt\u2192\u221e h at\u22121/3 (0,t) t 6= \u2212112 .\nRemark 1.7. In view of Remark 1.2, we should obtain that as b \u2192 \u2212a,\nF HYa,b (s) \u2212\u2212\u2212\u2212\u2192 b\u2192\u2212a F Browniana (s), (24)\nalthough this is not immediately apparent from our formulas.\n1.3.4 Summary. The results presented above for the different phases of the diagram in Fig. 1 can be summarized in a unified manner. We expect that for any a, b \u2208 R, scaling u = at\u22121/3, v = bt\u22121/3, when one considers the initial condition h(x, 0) = hstatu,v (x) defined in (6), we have that\nlim t\u2192\u221e P\n( hat\u22121/3(0, t) + t 12\nt1/3 6 s\n) = F stata,b (s), (25)\nfor some CDF F stata,b . We have obtained (25) and determined a formula for F stat a,b in a number of cases (see Fig. 2), in particular:\nF stata,b (s) =    F HYa,0 (s) for a > 0, b > 0, F Browniana for a 6 0, b > a, F HYa,b (s) for a > b, b 6 0, a + b > 0,\nF Browniana for a > 0, a + b = 0,\n(26)\nwhere F Browniana is defined in Section 1.3.2 and F HY a,b is defined in Section 1.3.3. In the next Sections, we will denote by \u03bea,b a random variable with distribution F stata,b .\n1.3.5 Away from the boundary. While we understand now the distribution and asymptotics of hu(0, t) and we know as well the distribution of stationary spatial increments hu(x, t) \u2212 hu(0, t), we cannot immediately deduce the asymptotics of hu(x, t) for\nx > 0. This is due to the fact that the random variables hu(0, t) and hu(x, t) \u2212 hu(0, t) are correlated in a very nontrivial way.\nHowever, the distribution of hu(x, t) can be computed explicitly, at least in the large time limit, for the same initial condition as in the previous sections. When x = x\u0303t2/3, we obtain\nlim t\u2192\u221e P\n hat\u22121/3(t 2/3x\u0303, t) + t12 t1/3 6 y   = GHYa,b (y, x\u0303). (27)\nThe CDF is computed in Appendix B and given in (191)."

            "heading": "1.4 Two-time covariance",
            "text": "An interesting application of our results concerns the two-time covariance. For general initial conditions, one can study the correlation of the KPZ height field at two different times, i.e. the correlation of h(0, t1) and h(0, t) (here we focus on the same space point). In the limit where both times are large 1 \u226a t1 < t with a fixed ratio \u03c4 = t1/t, this covariance becomes a universal function C(\u03c4) of \u03c4 \u2208 [0, 1], whose specific form depends only on the class of initial condition (stationary, droplet, flat, etc. . . ). This covariance, as well as the full two-time height distribution, were studied for the full-space geometry [33\u201342] and measured in experiments [43]. One defines for a general initial condition,\nC(\u03c4) = lim t\u2192+\u221e 1 t2/3 Cov(hu(0, t\u03c4), hu(0, t)) (28)\nThe results of this paper allow to obtain some predictions for C(\u03c4) in the half-space geometry. In particular we obtain C(\u03c4) for the stationary initial conditions for all 0 < \u03c4 < 1, and for droplet initial conditions for close times, i.e. 1 \u2212 \u03c4 \u226a 1. Of particular interest are the dimensionless ratios\n\u033a(\u03c4) = lim t\u2192+\u221e Cov(hu(0, t\u03c4), hu(0, t))\u221a Varhu(0, t\u03c4)Varhu(0, t) = C(\u03c4) \u03c41/3C(1) , (29)\nR(\u03c4) = lim t\u2192+\u221e Cov(hu(0, t\u03c4), hu(0, t)) Varhu(0, t\u03c4) = C(\u03c4) \u03c42/3C(1) , (30)\nwhich measure the overlap of the two polymer configurations (of lengths \u03c4t and t respectively). In particular a finite value of R(0), i.e. in the limit of infinitely separated times is a measure of memory or ergodicity breaking [34,36,43].\nLet us first consider the droplet initial condition, and start by recalling the result for the full-space problem. For close times, i.e. in the limit \u03c4 \u2192 1, one expects that the height profile reaches local stationarity at the intermediate time, which allows to compute the two-time covariance. Indeed it was shown that [33]\nCdroplet(\u03c4) = Var[\u03beGUE] \u2212 1 2 Var[\u03beBR](1 \u2212 \u03c4)2/3 + O(1 \u2212 \u03c4), (31)\nwhere \u03beGUE follows the GUE Tracy-Widom distribution and \u03beBR denotes a random variable following the Baik-Rains distribution [13]. We have Var[\u03beBR] \u2248 1.1504. In this paper we extend the arguments of [33] to the half-line geometry. The results depend on the value of the boundary parameter u. In the critical region (u close to zero) it is natural to scale the boundary parameter u = at\u22121/3, and, as shown below, we obtain for the droplet initial condition (centered at x = 0), as \u03c4 \u2192 1,\nCdroplet(\u03c4) = Var [ \u03bedropleta ] \u2212 1\n2 Var\n[ \u03be0,0 ] (1 \u2212 \u03c4)2/3 + O(1 \u2212 \u03c4), (32)\nwhere \u03bedropleta denotes a random variable with distribution F droplet a defined in (12), and \u03be0,0 denotes a random variable with distribution F stat0,0 = F Brownian 0 . The variance was computed in [6], we have Var[\u03be0,0] \u2248 1.649. In the particular case a = 0 the variable \u03bedroplet0 has the GOE Tracy Widom distribution and its variance is Var[\u03be droplet 0 ] \u2248 1.6078. In the limit a \u2192 +\u221e one enters the unbound phase and \u03bedroplet\u221e has the GSE Tracy-Widom distribution [44] with variance is Var[\u03bedroplet\u221e ] \u2248 0.5177.\nConsider now stationary initial conditions. In that case one can compute C(\u03c4) for arbitrary \u03c4 \u2208 [0, 1]. Let us recall the result in full-space, obtained in [33]. If the initial condition is given by a standard Brownian motion, one obtains\nC(\u03c4) = 1 2\n( 1 + \u03c42/3 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03c4)2/3 ) Var[\u03beBR]. (33)\nNote that it leads to the dimensionless ratio R(\u03c4) = C(\u03c4) \u03c42/3 \u2192\u03c4\u21920 12 which shows a memory effect at very separated times. We have extended the arguments of [33] to the half-line geometry. The results depend on the value of the boundary and drift parameters u, v. Let us start with the discussion of the critical region with u = at\u22121/3, v = bt\u22121/3. We find, for any a, b, starting from the initial condition hstat\nat\u22121/3,bt\u22121/3 ,\nC(\u03c4) = 1 2\n( Var(\u03bea,b) + \u03c42/3Var(\u03bea\u03c41/3,b\u03c41/3) \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03c4)2/3Var(\u03bea(1\u2212\u03c4)1/3 ,b(1\u2212\u03c4)1/3) ) . (34)\nwhere \u03bea,b a random variable with distribution F stata,b defined in (26).\nRemark 1.8. For \u03c4 \u2192 0 one finds R(0+) = 12 Var(\u03be0,0) Var(\u03bea,b)\nRemark 1.9. Consider the case a = 0 and b > 0. For b > 0, \u03bea,b = \u03bea,0 by definition, and for a = 0, \u03bea,0 = \u03be0,0 = \u03beBrownian0 , so that the dimensionless ratio defined in (29) is asymptotically\n\u033a(\u03c4) = 1\n2\u03c41/3\n( 1 + \u03c42/3 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03c4)2/3 ) , (35)\nthat is exactly the same as for the KPZ equation in full-space [33]. For general a, b this is not the case however. Using Remark 1.6, the same formula is true in the case a = +\u221e, b > 0 (since \u03be+\u221e,0 = \u03beBrownian0 ).\nLet us now discuss what happens for fixed u, v. There are three phases which are depicted in Fig. 3 where the main results are summarized. The first phase is defined by u, v > 0 corresponding by to taking the limit a, b \u2192 +\u221e in the previous discussion. We find that the two-time covariance does not depend on u, v and is given by (35) (indeed, as explained in Remark 1.9, \u03be+\u221e,+\u221e = \u03beBrownian0 ).\nIf u < 0 or v < 0, however, the scalings will be different with height fluctuations of order t1/2 instead of t1/3. We define a variant of the coefficient C(\u03c4) by\nC\u0303(\u03c4) = lim t\u2192+\u221e 1 t Cov(hu(0, t\u03c4), hu(0, t)). (36)\nTo discuss the phase u < 0 (with u < v), we consider the equivalent polymer picture. In that phase, the polymer is bound to the wall (with Gaussian free energy fluctuations) so that Cov(hu(0, t\u03c4), hu(0, t)) \u2243 Var(hu(0, t\u03c4)) at large time, which is known [7, 27] to be asymptotically equivalent to \u22122ut\u03c4 . This implies that C\u0303(\u03c4) = \u22122u\u03c4 . The R ratio being now equal to R(\u03c4) = C(\u03c4)\u03c4C(1) one finds that it is equal to R(\u03c4) = 1 in that phase.\nIn the phase v < 0 (with v < u), the covariance will be determined by the initial condition, which can be approximated at large scale by a Brownian motion with drift \u2212v. The free energy equals\nhu(0, t) = log Z(0, t) = log\n(\u222b +\u221e\n0 dxZ(x, 0|0, t)ehu(x,0)\n)\n\u2248 max x\n( log Z(x, 0|0, t) + hu(x, 0) ) . (37)\nThe optimal x = xmax can be approximated by arg max { x2 4t + vt }\nso that xmax \u2243 \u22122vt and the fluctuations of the free energy log Z(x, 0|0, t) are subdominant compared to fluctuations of h(x, 0). Thus, we again have that Cov(hu(0, t\u03c4), hu(0, t)) \u2243 Var(hu(0, t\u03c4)) which is asymptotically equivalent to the variance of the initial condition Var(hu(x, 0)) at the point x = \u2212t\u03c4v. Since the initial condition can be approximated at large scale by a Brownian motion with drift \u2212v, we find that Cov(hu(0, t\u03c4), h(0, t)) = \u22122vt\u03c4 . This implies that C\u0303(\u03c4) = \u22122v\u03c4 , and again the R ratio is again equal to R(\u03c4) = C(\u03c4)\u03c4C(1) one finds that it is equal to R(\u03c4) = 1 in that phase."

First of all, outside of the Brownian phase (a 6 0, a 6 b), the fact that the Hariya-Yor processes defined in (6) are stationary for the half-space KPZ equation was discovered in [10]. These processes arose as L \u2192 +\u221e limits of stationary processes for the KPZ equation on [0, L], for which formulas had been found in [8]. That the L \u2192 +\u221e limit of stationary processes on [0, L] are stationary for the dynamics on R+ is a very reasonable hypothesis, but it still needs to be formally proven mathematically.\nThe computation of limiting distributions obtained in this article rely on a combination of physics and mathematics methods, but we focus in this article on physics results and do not attempt to prove the results according to the standards of writing in the mathematics literature. We refer to [6, Section 2.4] where we had already discussed the interplay\nbetween these physics and mathematics arguments, as well as the main challenges that would arise to turn these results into mathematical proofs. The results of [45, Section 10] would likely be useful in order to prove rigorously the Pfaffian formula for the generating series (51).\nThe results of Section 1.4 also rely on a mixture of established facts, and assumptions based on analogies with the full-space setting, about the universal processes describing the large time fluctuations of h(x, t), starting from various initial conditions. It would be interesting to confirm those assumptions by rigorous proofs.\nAcknowledgements.

Assuming that there is at most one solution to these equations, we obtain that for x1 > x2 > \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 > xk > 0, u + v1 > k, u + v2 > k, v1 \u2212 1/2 > k \u2212 1 and v2 \u2212 1/2 > k \u2212 1,\nE [ Z(x1, t) . . . Z(xk, t) ] = f(~x, t|u, v1, v2) (44)\nwhere f(~x, t|u, v1, v2) is defined in (43).\nRemark 2.2. When v1 \u2192 +\u221e one has that Z0(x) \u2192 w1w2eB2(x) and thus one recovers the result (4.19) in [6], taking into account that wk1 = \u0393(v1+u\u2212k) \u0393(v1+u) and wk2 = \u0393(v2+u\u2212k) \u0393(v2+u) . When v2 \u2192 +\u221e one has v2Z0(x) \u2192 w1eB1(x) and the same works.\nLet us now explain why f(~x, t|u, v1, v2) satisfies each of the equations (39), (40), (41) and (42) one by one (except for (42), the arguments are based on [20] and [48]).\nThe function \u220fk\ni=1 e tz2i \u2212xizi is a solution of (39) for any ~z, so that by linearity, the\nfunction f(~x, t|u, v1, v2) is also a solution.\nLet us apply the operator ( \u2202xi+1 \u2212 \u2202xi \u2212 1 ) to f(~x, t|u, v) and let us assume that xi = xi+1 for some i. The application of the operator brings a factor (\u2212zi+1 + zi \u2212 1) inside the integrand in (43). This extra factor cancels with the denominator za \u2212 zb \u2212 1 for a = i, b = i + 1, so that there is no pole anymore at zi+1 = zi \u2212 1. Hence, we may deform the contour for zi+1 to be the same as the one for zi. Because of the factor za \u2212 zb for a = i, b = i + 1, the integrand is now antisymmetric with respect to exchanging zi and zi+1, and since both variables are integrated along the same contour, their integral is zero. We conclude that f(~x, t|u, v) satisfies (40).\nLet as apply the operator ( \u2202xk \u2212 u + 12 ) to f(~x, t|u, v). This brings an extra factor \u2212zk \u2212 u + 12 to the integrand, which cancels the denominator zk + u \u2212 12 already present in the formula. After this cancellation, and if one assumes that xk = 0, then the integrand is antisymmetric with respect to changing zk into \u2212zk. Furthermore, the integrand has no pole anymore at zk = \u2212(u\u2212 12) so that the contour of zk can be freely deformed to the left, regardless of the value of u. Since v \u2212 12 > k \u2212 1, it is then always possible to shift the zk contour to the left so that v\u221212 > r1 > r2+1 > \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 > rk\u22121+k\u22122 > max{k\u22121, k\u22122\u2212(u\u221212 )} and rk = 0. Now, the integration contour for zk is symmetric with respect to changing zk into \u2212zk, and thus the integral is zero. We conclude that f(~x, t|A, B) satisfies (41).\nLet us assume that t = 0 and x1 > x2 > . . . xk > 0. The formula agrees with moments of Zu,v1,v2(x) using a scaling limit of the half-space log-gamma polymer moment formula from [19] (see [6, Proposition 4.2]). More precisely, we take \u03b1\u25e6 = u, \u03b11 = v1, \u03b12 = v2 and for i > 3, \u03b1i = 12 + \u221a n and consider the log-gamma partition function Z(\u221anx/2, 2). The scaling limit is explained in [6, Section 4.3], see also [7, Appendix C.3]."

Assume that we start from the initial condition h(x, 0) = hstatu,v (x). Recall that by stationarity, E [ Xt(\u03c4) ] = 0, so that we have\nC(\u03c4) = lim t\u2192\u221e 1 2\n( VarXt(1) + VarXt(\u03c4) \u2212 E [ (Xt(1) \u2212 Xt(\u03c4))2 ]) .

At large time, the height field should converge locally to one of the invariant distributions. The limiting distribution depends on the boundary parameter, u, and the drift of the initial condition, according to the diagram in [7, Fig. 2]. In the case of the droplet initial condition, the drift parameter v = +\u221e, so the height field converges to the invariant process HYu,0, see [10, Fig. 2]. More precisely, for x in a domain of order 1, and u > 0,\nlim t\u2192\u221e\nhu(x, t) \u2212 hu(0, t) (d) = HYu,0(x) \u2212 HYu,0(0). (110)\nWhen u < 0,\nlim t\u2192\u221e\nhu(x, t) \u2212 hu(0, t) (d) = B(x) + ux. (111)\nHence, for any u,\nlim t\u2192\u221e\nhu(x, t) \u2212 hu(0, t) (d) = hstatu,0 (x). (112)\nOn the other hand, we also know by (90) that on the scale t2/3, if u = at\u22121/3 the height field converges to Aa, that is\nlim t\u2192\u221e\nhu(2x\u0302t2/3, t) \u2212 hu(0, t) (d) = t1/3 ( Aa(x\u0302) \u2212 Aa(0) \u2212 x\u03022 ) . (113)\nWe expect that (112) and (113) match when x = 2x\u0302t2/3 goes to infinity and x\u0302 goes to zero. This implies that, for x\u0302 going to zero,\nlim t\u2192\u221e t\u22121/3hstatat\u22121/3(2x\u0302t 2/3)\n(d) = Aa(x\u0302) \u2212 Aa(x\u0302). (114)\nIn other terms, for x\u0302 going to zero and any fixed a \u2208 R,\nhrescaleda,0 (x\u0302) \u2243 Aa(x\u0302) \u2212 Aa(0). (115)\nScaling u as u = at\u22121/3, we obtain, by replacing t \u2192 \u03c4t and a \u2192 a\u03c41/3 in (90), that the height field at the earlier time satisfies for large t\nhat\u22121/3(x, \u03c4t) + \u03c4t\n12 \u2243 (\u03c4t)1/3\n\nAa\u03c41/3 (\nx\n2(\u03c4t)2/3\n) \u2212 x 2\n4(\u03c4t)4/3\n\n (116)\nThis field can then be used as an initial condition for the evolution from time \u03c4t to time t. Using formula (92) with t \u2192 (1 \u2212 \u03c4)t, a \u2192 a(1 \u2212 \u03c4)1/3 and y\u0302 = x\n2(t(1\u2212\u03c4))2/3 it leads to\nthe variational formula, where we denote \u03c4\u0302 = \u03c41\u2212\u03c4\nXt(1) \u2243 (1 \u2212 \u03c4)1/3 max y\u0302>0\n{ \u03c4\u03021/3Aa\u03c41/3 ( \u03c4\u0302\u22122/3y\u0302 ) \u2212 \u03c4\u0302\u22121y\u03022 + A\u0303a(1\u2212\u03c4)1/3(y\u0302) \u2212 y\u03022 } , (117)\nwhere the processes Aa\u03c41/3 and A\u0303a(1\u2212\u03c4)1/3 are independent, because they describe the growth over two disjoint time intervals. Thus, using (116) with x = 0, Xt(1) \u2212 Xt(\u03c4) has asymptotically the same distribution as\n(1 \u2212 \u03c4)1/3 max y\u0302>0\n{ \u03c4\u03021/3 ( Aa\u03c41/3 ( \u03c4\u0302\u22122/3y\u0302 ) \u2212 Aa\u03c41/3 (0) \u2212 \u03c4\u0302\u22124/3y\u03022 ) + A\u0303a(1\u2212\u03c4)1/3(y\u0302) \u2212 y\u03022 } .\n(118) In the limit 1 \u2212 \u03c4 \u226a 1, the argument \u03c4\u0302\u22122/3y\u0302 is small and one can use (115) and the scale invariance property (108) leading to\nXt(1) \u2212 Xt(\u03c4) \u2243 (1 \u2212 \u03c4)1/3 max y\u0302>0\n{ hrescaleda(1\u2212\u03c4)1/3,0(y\u0302) + A\u0303a(1\u2212\u03c4)1/3(y\u0302) \u2212 y\u0302 2 } ,\n\u2243 (1 \u2212 \u03c4)1/3\u03bea(1\u2212\u03c4)1/3,0 where in the last formula we used (95) and (94) .

We show in this Section that very similar arguments as those already developed in [6] also yields an expression for F Browniana (s) for any a \u2208 R. We start from\nF Browniana (s) = lim b\u2192\u2212a F (a,b)(s) (121)\nwhere F (a,b)(s) was given in [6, (7.11)] as\nF (a,b)(s) = 1 2\n( 1 +\n\u2202s a + b\n)( Det(I \u2212 A\u0302s) + Det(I + A\u0302s) ) (122)\nWe will follow the same notations as in [6] (up to minor changes). The operator As acts L\n2(0, +\u221e) with kernel A\u0302s(x, y) = A(a,b)(x + y + s), (123)\nwhere the function A(a,b)(x) is defined by\nA(a,b)(x) = \u222b\ndz 2i\u03c0 a + z a \u2212 z b + z b \u2212 z e \u2212xz+ z 3 3 , (124)\nand the contour is a vertical line with real part between 0 and min{a, b}. Moving the contour to the right, we obtained in [6] that\nA(a,b)(x) = A\u0303(a,b)(x) + 2 a + b a \u2212 b(hb(x) \u2212 ha(x)), (125)\nwith hb(x) = be\u2212xb+b 3/3. Letting b = \u2212a + \u01eb, we have\nA\u0303(a,b)(x) = \u222b\ndz 2i\u03c0 a + z a \u2212 z b + z b \u2212 z e\n\u2212xz+z3/3 = Ai(x) + 2\u01eb \u222b +\u221e\nx d\u03bb cosh(ay)Ai(\u03bb + y) + O(\u01eb2),\n(126) (I corrected that formula) where in the integral over z, the contour passes to the right of a, b. We also introduce the operator A\u0303s acting on L2(0, +\u221e) with kernel\nA\u0303s(x, y) = A\u0303(a,b)(s + x + y).\nA\u0302s is a rank-2 perturbation of A\u0303s, in the sense that\nA\u0302s(x, y) = A\u0303s(x, y) + 2 a + b a \u2212 b(b |fb(x)\u3009 \u3008fb(y)| \u2212 a |fa(x)\u3009 \u3008fa(y)|), (127)\nwith fb(x) = eb 3/6\u2212bs/2\u2212bx. Using the matrix determinant lemma, we have Det(I\u2213A\u0302s) = Det(I\u2213A\u0303s)   (\n1 \u2213 2ba + b a \u2212 bIb,b\n)( 1 \u00b1 2aa + b a \u2212 bIa,a ) + 4ab ( a + b a \u2212 b )2 Ib,aIa,b  \n(128) where\nI\u03b1,\u03b2 = \u3008f\u03b1|f\u03b2\u3009 \u00b1 \u3008f\u03b1| A\u0303s\nI \u2213 A\u0303s |f\u03b2\u3009 . (129)\nThe scalar products are evaluated as\n\u3008f\u03b1|f\u03b2\u3009 = 1\n\u03b1 + \u03b2 e\n\u03b13\n6 + \u03b2\n3\n6 \u2212 \u03b1+\u03b2 2 s (130)\nand\n\u3008f\u03b1| A\u0303s\nI \u2213 A\u0303s |f\u03b2\u3009 = e\n\u03b13\n6 + \u03b2\n3\n6 e\u2212 \u03b1+\u03b2 2 s \u3008e\u2212\u03b1x| A\u0303s\nI \u2213 A\u0303s |e\u2212\u03b2x\u3009 .

Hence, dividing by \u01eb and using (121) and (122),\nF Browniana (s) = 1 2\n\u2202s ( Det(I \u2212 Ais)S\u2212a + Det(I + Ais)S+a ) (133)\nwhere Ais denotes the operator with kernel Ai(x + y + s),\nS\u2212a = e as\u2212 a\n3 3 R\u2212\u2212a,\u2212a + e a3 3 \u2212asR\u2212a,a \u2212 2R\u2212a,\u2212a +\nsinh ( 1 3a ( a2 \u2212 3s ))\na \u2212 a2 + s, (134)\nS+a = e as\u2212 a\n3 3 R+\u2212a,\u2212a + e a3 3 \u2212asR+a,a + 2R + a,\u2212a \u2212\nsinh ( 1 3a ( a2 \u2212 3s ))\na \u2212 a2 + s (135)\nand\nR\u2213\u03b1,\u03b2 = \u3008e\u2212\u03b1x| Ais\nI \u2213 Ais |e\u2212\u03b2x\u3009 . (136)\nWe may check that for a = 0, S\u22120 = 0 and S + 0 = 4R + 0 + 2s, so that we recover exactly the result from [6]. Using the Sherman-Morrison formula, we have that\nR\u2213\u03b1,\u03b2 = \u2213 Det(I \u2213 Ais \u2213 |Aise\u2212\u03b2y\u3009 \u3008e\u2212\u03b1x|)\nDet(I \u2213 Ais) \u00b1 1.

Additionally, we need to chose as > 1/2, so that \u0393(2s \u2212 1) has no poles on the right of contours. One also needs to discuss the convergence of the w integral. A sufficient condition for the integrals over wi to be convergent is that aw \u2212 1/2 < x/2.\nB.3 Pfaffian formula in the large time limit\nWe now consider the large time limit, and the critical region, hence we rescale\nu = at\u22121/3, v1 = bt\u22121/3, v2 = ct\u22121/3, (147) wi \u2192 1 2 + t\u22121/3wi, si \u2192 1 2 + t\u22121/3si, (148) x = t2/3x\u0303, \u03c2 = exp(\u2212yt1/3).

The values of aw, as now satisfy\nmax{\u2212a, \u2212b, \u2212c, 0} < aw < as < min{b, c}, (152)\nwhich can be happen only when b, c > 0 and a + b, a + c > 0.

In other terms, \u03b5 is the identity operator, i.e. \u03b5 = I.

Recall the expression of the symplectic matrix\nJ =\n( 0 1\n\u22121 0\n) .
