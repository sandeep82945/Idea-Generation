    "abstractText": "Hydrogels\u2019 exceptional mechanical strength and skin-adhesion characteristics offer significant advantages for various applications, particularly in the fields of tissue adhesion and wearable sensors. Herein, we incorporated a combination of metal-coordination and hydrogen-bonding forces in the design of stretchable and adhesive hydrogels. We synthesized four hydrogels, namely PAID-0, PAID-1, PAID-2, and PAID-3, consisting of acrylamide (AAM), N,N\u2032-methylene-bis-acrylamide (MBA), and methacrylic-modified dopamine (DA). The impact of different ratios of iron (III) ions to DA on each hydrogel\u2019s performance was investigated. Our results demonstrate that the incorporation of iron\u2013dopamine complexes significantly enhances the mechanical strength of the hydrogel. Interestingly, as the DA content increased, we observed a continuous and substantial improvement in both the stretchability and skin adhesiveness of the hydrogel. Among the hydrogels tested, PAID-3, which exhibited optimal mechanical properties, was selected for adhesion testing on various materials. Impressively, PAID-3 demonstrated excellent adhesion to diverse materials and, combined with the low cytotoxicity of PAID hydrogel, holds great promise as an innovative option for biomedical engineering applications.",

            "text": "Hydrogels, recognized as soft materials in the field of materials science, are threedimensional (3D) cross-linked polymer networks with the remarkable capability of absorbing and retaining a substantial amount of water [1\u20137]. The significant attention hydrogels have received is due to their high water content and the related potential they hold for numerous biomedical applications, including tissue engineering [8\u201312], soft robotics [13\u201317], wearable devices [18\u201321], personal care [22\u201324], and more. Hydrogels are commonly prepared using both synthetic and natural polymers. Synthetic hydrogels employ diverse chemistries to cross-link synthetic polymer molecules, resulting in hydrogels that exhibit relatively high mechanical strength. However, once these hydrogels are formed, they become challenging to remold. Consequently, they are not suitable for many applications, particularly in the fields of cell culture and tissue engineering. To address this limitation, the incorporation of physical non-covalent bond forces, such as metal coordination, hostguest interactions, ionic interactions, hydrogen bonding, hydrophobic interactions, and \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions, is employed to enhance the flexibility, adjustability, and reversibility of hydrogels [25\u201331]. Inspired by nature, specific biomaterials that possess abundant metal-coordination bonds, for example, mussels, exhibit an impressive blend of high toughness, adhesion,\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4378. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15224378 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nand reversibility [32\u201337]. As a result, this concept of biomaterials is extensively used by researchers in the development of functional hydrogels [38\u201344]. Das et al. have developed hydrogels of poly(methacrylamide-co-vinylimidazole)-M2+ (M = Ni and Zn), which demonstrate an exceptionally broad range of mechanical properties, rapid self-recovery, remarkable fatigue resistance, efficient self-healing, and temperature-dependent shape memory behavior [38]. Hao et al. have devised metal-ligand-coordinated hydrogels with adjustable strength and thermosensitivity [39]. Wu and Zheng have reported a physical hydrogel comprised of poly(acrylamide-co-acrylic acid) (P(AAm-co-AAc)) cross-linked by carboxyl\u2013Fe3+ coordination complexes. This hydrogel exhibits remarkable stiffness, toughness, fatigue resistance, and the ability to undergo stimulation-triggered healing [42]. More recently, Wu et al. have created robust hydrazide-transition metal-coordination complexes to enhance the toughness of hydrogels [43]. Therefore, in this study, we chose to employ the approach of metal coordination to improve the mechanical properties of hydrogels. We specifically opted to utilize dopamine as a building block due to its reputation for forming iron\u2013dopamine complexes [33,44]. Simultaneously, dopamine has the potential to engage in aromatic \u03c0-stack interactions with drugs like bortezomib, doxorubicin, topotecan, and others, facilitating controlled drug delivery for cancer treatment [45\u201347]. Furthermore, dopamine holds promise for emulating mussel adhesives, offering excellent adhesion properties. We synthesized four hydrogels, namely PAID-0, PAID-1, PAID-2, and PAID-3, composed of acrylamide (AAM), N,N\u2032-methylene-bis-acrylamide (MBA), and methacrylic-modified dopamine (DA). Our investigation focused on evaluating the impact of two factors: (1) the presence of iron\u2013 dopamine complexes (PAID-0 served as the control); and (2) the influence of hydrogenbonding interactions involving dopamine on the mechanical and adhesive properties of the hydrogels. We demonstrated that the incorporation of iron\u2013dopamine complexes substantially enhances the mechanical strength of the hydrogel. Notably, with increasing dopamine content, we observed a continuous and pronounced improvement in both the stretchability and skin-adhesion properties of the hydrogel. This discovery opens up new possibilities for the application of tissue adhesion and wearable sensors."

Meanwhile, we also prepared PAID-0 (iron ion: DA = 0:3) for comparison with PAID-1 in order to understand the influence of iron ions on the hydrogel. As shown in Figure 1, the appearance of PAID-0 is a transparent white hydrogel, and, upon the addition of FeCl3\u00b76H2O, the hydrogels transform into transparent light yellow hydrogels (PAID-1, PAID-2, and PAID-3).

Through the analysis of the absorbance FT-IR peaks of PAID-0, it was observed that the absorption bands at 3375 and 3208 cm\u22121 were indicative of the N\u2013H and/or O\u2013H stretching vibration [49]. Additionally, the absorption bands around 1665 and 1435 cm\u22121 were characteristic of C=O stretching in the amide group and C=C stretching in aromatics, respectively [50,51]. It is worth noting that the O\u2013H stretching bands manifest at lower frequencies, i.e., 3343 and 3198 cm\u22121, suggesting the potential formation of iron\u2013DA complexes in PAID-1, PAID-2, and PAID-3 (Figure 2) [52].

Moreover, we conducted a comparison between the PAID-0 hydrogel and the AAM/MBA hydrogel described in the literature [54,55]. Our observations revealed that, in contrast to the AAM/MBA hydrogel, the N-H and C=O vibrations in the PAID-0 gel shifted towards lower wavenumbers, possibly due to the enhanced hydrogen bonds resulting from the incorporation of DA. Based on the FT-IR data, we have discerned plausible molecular interactions within PAID hydrogels, involving metal-coordination, hydrogen-bonding, and \u03c0-\u03c0-stacking interactions (Figure 3). Subsequently, we used a scanning electron microscope (SEM) to examine the nanostructures of the PAID hydrogels.

On the one hand, tensile stress-strain analysis helps in designing and assessing the mechanical performance of materials, determining their suitability for specific applications [56,57]. On the other hand, rheology finds widespread applications across diverse fields, including polymer processing, chemical engineering, and pharmaceuticals. The importance of rheology lies in understanding the flow and deformation behavior of materials, which is critical for optimizing processes and developing high-quality products [58,59]. In Figure 5, the tensile stress-strain curves of PAID hydrogels are presented. It was found that PAID-0 exhibited a tensile strength of 4.7 kPa a d an elong tion break of 675%. Upon the introductio of iron io s into PAID-0, i.e., PAID-1, both th tensile strength and elongation br ak increased to 12.6 kPa and 743%, respectively.\nThe dramatic enhancement in tensile strength of PAID-1 compared to PAID-0 is likely attributed to the formation of a tris-complex between iron and DA [44]. By keeping the amount of iron ions constant and progressively increasing the amount of DA, we observed a continuous increase in elongation at break; however, there was a decrease in tensile strength. Specifically, for PAID-2 and PAID-3, the tensile strength values were reduced to 10.7 kPa and 8.0 kPa, respectively, while the corresponding elongation break values were measured at 882% and 1011%. The elevated elongation break values in PAID-2 and PAID-3 are probably due to the formation of additional reversible noncovalent bonds, such as hydrogen bonding and/or \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions, ultimately resulting in the enhanced stretchability of the hydrogel. This improvement in mechanical properties aligns with the findings derived from the SEM images presented in Figure 4. The SEM images provided visual evidence that the microstructure of PAID-3 supports higher elongation before failure, which is consistent with the increased elongation break values observed in the mechanical testing. Furthermore, when compared to the metal coordination hydrogels reported in the literature, PAID-3 presented outstanding stretchability, reaching 1011% strain, as indicated in Table S2. This remarkable stretchability opens up possibilities for various applications, particularly in scenarios where a hydrogel with high mechanical flexibility is required, such as in biomedical devices and tissue engineering. These findings highlight the potential of PAID hydrogels to provide innovative solutions in materials science and biotechnology.

            "text": "For biomedical applications, it is crucial to assess the biocompatibility of hydrogels [61\u201364]. In order to evaluate hydrogels\u2019 compatibility with living cells, the widely-used MTT assay was employed [65,66]. This assay provides valuable insights into the viability and metabolic activity of cells in the presence of the hydrogels, aiding in determining their suitability for use in various biomedical applications such as tissue engineering and drug delivery systems. As depicted in Figure 7, the cell viability of L929 cells on PAID hydrogels was assessed for 1, 3, and 7 days. The cell survival rate of L929 cells cultured in these hydrogels for 7 days was above 90%, confirming the exceptional biocompatibility of PAID hydrogels. The statistical analysis of p-values was conducted using the Student\u2019s t-test and is summarized in Table S4. The significance of these p-values lies in their capacity to determine whether the differences observed between the groups are statistically meaningful. A p-value below the conventional threshold of 0.05 indicates that the observed differences are not likely the result of random chance alone, demonstrating a statistically significant outcome. It is well established that polyacrylamide-based gels can undergo degradation under various environmental conditions, including chemical, photolytic, thermal, mechanical, and biological processes. Among them, the biodegradation characteristics of hydrogels play a crucial role in drug delivery and tissue engineering. Therefore, we evaluated the degradation of PAID hydrogels in a phosphate-buffered saline solution at 37 \u25e6C; the results are depicted in Figure S1. The degradation rates of the hydrogels follow the order PAID-0 > PAID-3 \u2248 PAID-2 > PAID-1, which correlates with their mechanical strength trends. This indicates that metal-coordination interactions may be the predominant factor driving degradation (Figure S1). Polymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 13\n3.5. Adhesive and Stretchable Capacities of PAID Hydrogels\nTaking into account both mechanical properties and biocompatibility, we decided to conduct additional adhesion and stretchability tests specifically on the PAID-3 hydrogel [66\u201368]. Our findings indicate that PAID-3 has good adhesion to glass, plastic, stainless steel, gloves, aluminum, and wood, as demonstrated in Figure 8. Due to the adhesive nature of PAID-3 to various materials, we propose a potential interface adhesion mechanism between PAID-3 and the substrate (Figure 9) [69]. Moreover, we measured the adhesive strength of PAID-3 on various substrates and compared it with the literature (Figure S2 and Table S3). Our results demonstrated that PAID-3 exhibited strong adhesive properties, with an adhesive strength of approximately 15.2 kPa on glass. Furthermore, we employed PAID-3 as an adhesive for glass, as illustrated in Figure 10a. By sandwiching PAID-3 between two glass pieces, we observed its effective adhesion to glass surfaces. Additionally, we applied PAID-3 to the fingers of both hands and conducted tests involving tensile forces and weight support (Figure 10b). Remarkably, PAID-3 exhibited exceptional adhesion to the skin, impressive stretchability, and remarkable weight-bearing capabilities. The excellent adhesiveness of PAID-3 to various materials may be attributed to the hydrogen-bonding interactions between AMM and the substrate, as well as the hydrogen bonding and metal coordination between DA and the substrate [70,71]. Figure 10c presents the stretch test result of PAID-3, where the initial size of the hydrogel was 1.5 cm and it demonstrated the ability to stretch over 22 times its original length. Finally, we proceeded to verify the elasticity and toughness of PAID-3. For this purpose, we conducted an experiment where a 500 mL water bottle (filled with water) was supported using PAID-3, and the hydrogel/water bottle was subjected to shaking (Video S1). This test confirmed the excellent resilience and toughness of PAID-3. Consequently, we have successfully developed a hydrogel that combines stretchability, adhesion, and biocompatibility through the synergistic effects of utilizing iron\u2013DA complexes, \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction, and the hydrogenbond force of DA. This achievement not only holds significant potential for biomedical engineering applications but also for corrosion protection, anti-fouling, and more [72\u201374]."

Our research encompassed FT-IR, SEM, tensile stress-strain, and rheology experiments to elucidate the correlation between material properties and intermolecular forces. Through our analysis of PAID-0 and PAID-1, we validated the significance of metal coordination in enhancing the stiffness and toughness of hydrogels. Moreover, by increasing the dopamine content, we achieved improved stretchability and adhesion capabilities in the hydrogels (PAID-1, PAID-2, and PAID-3). Ultimately, we selected the PAID-3 hydrogel with optimal mechanical properties for adhesion testing on various materials. Remarkably, PAID-3 exhibited good adhesion to diverse materials as well as the low cytotoxicity of PAID hydrogel. Overall, it showcased great promise as a new option for biomedical engineering applications.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/polym15224378/s1.
