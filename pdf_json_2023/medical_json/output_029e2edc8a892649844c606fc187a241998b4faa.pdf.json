    "abstractText": "This study was performed to determine the effect of human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hucMSCs) treatment on pulmonary fibrosis and investigate the circFOXP1-mediated autophagic mechanism of hucMSCs treatment. Pulmonary fibrosis models were established by spraying bleomycin in mice and TGF-\u03b21 treatment of MRC-5 cells. Results showed that hucMSCs were retained in lung and hucMSCs treatment alleviated pulmonary fibrosis. Morphological staining indicated that hucMSCs-treated mice had thinner alveolar walls, effectively improved alveolar structure, significantly reduced alveolar inflammation, and decreased collagen deposition than control mice. Fibrotic proteins, including vimentin, \u03b1-SMA, collagens I and III, and the differentiation-related protein S100 calcium-binding protein A4 was reduced considerably in the hucMSCs-treated group. The mechanistic study revealed that the inhibition of hucMSCs treatment on pulmonary fibrogenesis depended on downregulating circFOXP1, in which hucMSCs treatment promoted circFOXP1-mediated autophagy process via blocking the nuclear human antigen R (HuR) translocation and promoting the HuR degradation, leading to a marked decrease in autophagy negative regulators EZH2, STAT1, and FOXK1. In conclusion, hucMSCs treatment significantly improved pulmonary fibrosis by downregulating the circFOXP1-HuR-EZH2/STAT1/ FOXK1 autophagic axis. hucMSCs can act as an effective treatment for pulmonary fibrosis.",

Therefore, there is a pressing need to identify a novel therapeutic approach for pulmonary fibrosis. Morphological and functional results demonstrated that hucMSCs treatment significantly improved pulmonary fibrosis. Mechanistic dissection unveiled the autophagic mechanism mediated directly by circFOXP1-HuR-EZH2/ STAT1/FOXK1 axis in hucMSCs treatment. This study provides a novel strategy to combat pulmonary fibrosis, which has potential general applicability in fibrotic disease treatment."

            "text": "Pulmonary fibrosis is defined as an excessive, pathologic deposition of the extracellular matrix during lung wound healing, and is characterized by destroyed lung parenchyma and architecture, lost compliance, and compromised gas exchange.1 Pulmonary fibrosis is not one disease but is an end-stage state of various diseases. Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is the most prevalent and morbid of all types. Although the underlying mechanisms of pulmonary fibrosis, such as genetics, epigenetics, and metabolism, have been revealed, treatment options are limited. Mainstay therapies are the oral antifibrotic drugs pirfenidone and nintedanib, which can decrease collagen deposition, attenuate symptoms, and lower the rate of decline in forced vital capacity. However, these therapies have some bad side effects, such as skin rash, weight loss, nausea, and fatigue, and abnormal liver function.2 At present, lung transplantation may be the only treatment to increase life expectancy but is challenging due to several concerns, such as risk of mortality and the likelihood of survival. Furthermore, other comorbidities that may lead to complications, such as cardiac dysfunction, diabetes, and obesity, are key considerations.3 The lack of curative treatment demands the aggressive pursuit of improved choices for pulmonary fibrosis. Glass DS et al. proposed that\nmesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) will be the future treatment for pulmonary fibrosis.4 The human autologous lung stem cell transplant for IPF (NCT04262167), a randomized trial of intravenous infusion of lung stem cells in patients with IPF, is currently enrolling. However, the knowledge of MSCs toward pulmonary fibrosis is still insufficient.\nMSCs are a heterogeneous subset of stromal stem cells that can induce peripheral tolerance and migrate to injured tissues.5 Human umbilical cord MSCs (hucMSCs) are a promising source of MSCs and attractive autologous or allogenic agents for disease treatment. hucMSCs transplantation facilitates locomotor function, promotes tissue repair, and inhibits demyelination in spinal cord injury rats.6 The intravenous transplantation of hucMSCs is a salvage and priority treatment option for severe COVID-19.7 The transplantation of hucMSCs can also treat premature ovarian failure.8 Hu et al obtained extracellular vesicles (EVs) from the conditioned medium of hucMSCs. Their results in vivo and in vitro illustrated that hucMSCs-EVs can serve as a potential agent for the prevention and treatment of osteoporosis.9 In addition, other studies reported that hucMSCs attenuate pulmonary fibrosis via different signal pathways.10-12 In recent years, some studies have found that targeting circRNA can regulate the development of pulmonary fibrosis. For\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /stm cls/article/41/10/928/7221330 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024\nexample, Lu G et al suggested that circRNA-662 and 949 can act as \u201cmiR-29b sponges\u201d targeting Gli2 and STAT3 to promote pulmonary fibrosis.13 Xu et al considered that circANKRD42 mediates cross-talk of mechanical hardness and biochemical signals in pulmonary fibrosis14 Xu Q et al proved that circHIPK3 regulates pulmonary fibrosis by facilitating glycolysis in miR-30a-3p/FOXK2-dependent manner.15 However, the roles and mechanisms of circRNAs in the process of hucMSCs attenuating pulmonary fibrosis are largely unknown.\ncircRNAs exhibit cell-/tissue-specific development and stage-specific characteristics in multiple fundamental biological processes physiologically and pathologically, suggesting that circRNAs can be used as potential biomarkers for disease diagnosis and therapy. Recent studies demonstrated correlations between circRNA and autophagy in many diseases.16,17 For example, autophagy-associated circCDYL is screened by circRNA deep sequencing and can augment autophagy and promote breast cancer progression.18 Autophagy-related circACR represses autophagy and myocardial infarction by targeting the Pink1-mediated phosphorylation of FAM65B.19 However, the relationship between hucMSCs treatment and autophagy-associated circRNA in pulmonary fibrosis remains largely illusive.\nIn our previous study,20 the crosstalk of mRNA, miRNA, lncRNA, and circRNA and their regulatory pattern in pulmonary fibrosis have been elucidated. The circ057 is formed by the circularization of the sequence of 9-10 exons in forkhead box protein 1 (FOXP1) gene and functions as a profibrotic factor. In this study, we name circ057 as circFOXP1 and explore its use as a therapeutic autophagy-related gene (ATG) for hucMSCs treatment in pulmonary fibrosis."

After 4 weeks of adipogenic induction, fat droplets of verified size were observed using phase-contrast microscopy with positive oil red O staining (Supplementary Fig. S1B). After 2 weeks of osteogenic induction, the calcium nodus alizarin red staining reaction was positive with the osteogenic inducer (Supplementary Fig. S1C). The flow cytometry of cell surface markers demonstrated that the cells expressed CD73, CD90, and CD44, not CD34, CD45, and human leukocyte antigen DR (HLA-DR) (Supplementary Fig. S1D). Finally, the cell plasma membrane staining was performed to test whether hucMSCs targeted lung and cellular distribution after BLM treatment. Then take a white bright picture for images of the cell membrane fluorescent probe to determine about its overall distribution in the lungs. The results verified that hucMSCs were retained in the lung (Fig. 1A, 1B). The above experimental data indicated that cells had the main features\nof MSCs and confirmed that hucMSCs had been successfully isolated and cultured in vitro, providing hucMSCs for pulmonary fibrosis treatment.\nhucMSCs Treatment Ameliorated Pulmonary Fibrosis Via Downregulating circFOXP1 In Vivo and In Vitro The preventive effect of hucMSCs treatment on pulmonary fibrosis was examined in bleomycin (BLM)-treated mice and in TGF-\u03b21-treated human fetal lung fibroblast (MRC-5 cell). hucMSCs were injected into mice through the tail vein after 3 days of BLM spraying. The lung tissue was harvested after 7, 14, 21, and 28 days of BLM treatment (Fig. 2A). Western blot results exhibited that the expression level of fibrotic proteins, including vimentin, \u03b1-SMA, collagen I, and collagen III increased gradually with the extension of BLM-treated time. hucMSCs treatment induced a rapid decrease in fibrotic proteins (Fig. 2B). H&E and Masson staining results showed that on the 7th day after BLM treatment, severe alveolar inflammation and fibroblasts hyperplasia occurred in lung tissue compared to the Sham group. On the 14th day, pulmonary fibrosis began to form. The alveolar wall thickened significantly and collagen deposition increased. On the 21st day, the alveolar structure and collagen deposition aggravated. On the 28th day, diffuse pulmonary interstitial fibrosis occurred and the interstitial was replaced by collagen fibers and fibroblasts. hucMSCs treatment improved alveolar inflammation, alveolar structure, and collagen deposition of BLM-treated mice (Fig.\nFigure 1. hucMSCs were retained in lung. (A) The cell plasma membrane staining was performed to verify that hucMSCs were retained in lung. Mice injected with serum-free medium were used as sham. Mice injected with hucMSCs without fluorescent labeling were used as NC-1 to prove that there was no biological autofluorescence. Mice injected with human kidney 2 (HK-2) cells labeled fluorescence were used as NC-2 to prove that there was no fluorescence dye leakage. (B) hucMSCs labeled with a cell membrane dye DiI were injected into mice through the tail vein after three days of BLM spraying. The fluorescence signals of the lung section were captured after 7, 14, 21, and 28 days of BLM treatment. The results showed that hucMSCs fluorescence signals were recorded in the lung of mice, indicating the strong targeting ability of hucMSCs to the lung. Mice injected with BLM or hucMSCs without fluorescent labeling were used as control.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /stm cls/article/41/10/928/7221330 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024\n2C). ELISA and Western blot analyzed inflammatory markers, including IL-18 and IL-1\u03b2. ELISA showed that on the 7th day of BLM treatment, the expression of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 was the highest, and then gradually decreased with the extension of BLM-treated time. hucMSCs treatment inhibits the expression of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 in mice lung tissue (Supplementary Fig S2A). Western blot illustrated hucMSCs treatment reduced the expression of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-18 (Supplementary Fig S2B). hucMSCs were injected into mice through the tail vein after 14 days of BLM spraying. The lung tissue was harvested after 28 days of BLM treatment (Fig. 2D). Western blot results illustrated that hucMSCs induced a rapid decrease in fibrotic proteins, including vimentin, \u03b1-SMA, and collagens I and III (Fig. 2E). H&E and Masson staining results exhibited thickened alveolar wall, widened alveolar septum, a large number of fibroblasts, and increased collagen deposition in the BLM-treated group. After the tail vein injection of hucMSCs, mice lungs had thinner alveolar walls, effectively improved alveolar structure, and significantly decreased collagen deposition compared with BLM-treated mice (Fig. 2F). The above results showed that hucMSCs treatment ameliorated pulmonary fibrosis in vivo.\nNext, the TGF-\u03b21-treated MRC-5 cell model was established to further examine the preventive effect and mechanism of hucMSCs supernatant treatment on pulmonary fibrosis. CCK-8 assay was used to detect cell proliferation. The results indicated that hucMSCs supernatant treatment inhibited the proliferation of TGF-\u03b21-treated cells (Fig. 3A). Further, cell growth curves with real-time cellular analysis (RTCA) verified that hucMSCs supernatant treatment prevented TGF-\u03b21-treated cell proliferation by using a real-time cell analyzer (Fig. 3B). The cell scratch assay monitored with an IncuCyte S3 instrument showed that the migration was promoted by TGF-\u03b21 treatment and repressed by hucMSCs supernatant treatment. (Fig. 3C). Immunofluorescent images and Western blot exhibited that the hucMSCs supernatanttreated group had substantially reduced \u03b1-SMA, vimentin, collagen I, collagen III, and S100A4 compared with the TGF-\u03b21-treated group (Figs. 3D\u2013E). The above results showed that hucMSCs supernatant treatment ameliorated pulmonary fibrosis in vitro. We further investigated the inhibitory effect of hucMSCs treatment on pulmonary fibrosis through circFOXP1. First, circFOXP1 expression was detected under hucMSCs action in vivo and hucMSCs supernatant action in vitro. qRT-PCR results illustrated that hucMSCs/ hucMSCs supernatant treatment inhibited circFOXP1 expression (Fig. 4A). The nuclear-cytoplasmic separation showed that circFOXP1 was located in the cytoplasm with or without TGF-\u03b21 and/or hucMSCs supernatant treatment (Fig. 4B), indicating that the function of circFOXP1 was post-transcriptional regulation. Then, circFOXP1 knockdown and overexpression were designed to study the role and regulatory mechanism of circFOXP1. The small interference fragment of circFOXP1 (si-circFOXP1) and overexpressed circFOXP1 plasmid was synthesized and constructed to transfect into MRC-5 cells or spray into the lungs of mice (Fig. 4C, 4D). Gain- and loss-of-function studies revealed that\ncircFOXP1 knockdown blocked TGF-\u03b21-treated cell proliferation and migration. Conversely, circFOXP1 overexpression promoted TGF-\u03b21-treated cell proliferation and migration (Fig. 4E, 4F). Moreover, si-circFOXP1 reduced the expression levels of vimentin, \u03b1-SMA, and collagens I and III. The circFOXP1 overexpression enhanced the expression of these fibrotic proteins (Fig. 4G). The rescue experiment showed that the circFOXP1 overexpression reversed the downward trend of these fibrotic proteins caused by hucMSCs supernatant treatment (Fig. 4H), which implied that the inhibitory effect of hucMSCs supernatant treatment on fibrosis depended on circFOXP1 in vitro.\nFinally, the reduction of pulmonary fibrosis by hucMSCs treatment via circFOXP1 was explored in mice. We synthesized the circFOXP1 overexpression packaged into adenovirus vectors and sprayed to the lungs of mice (Fig. 5A). The rescue experiment of the microcomputed tomography (CT) imaging system for small animals demonstrated that BLM caused evident fibrosis in both lower lungs, and hucMSCs alleviated the degree of fibrosis, and circFOXP1 upregulation reversed the inhibitory effect of hucMSCs on fibrosis (Fig. 5B). The rescue experiments of H&E and Masson staining further proved that thickened alveolar walls and increased collagen deposition in the lung tissue of BLM-treated mice. hucMSCs alleviated morphological abnormalities, and circFOXP1 upregulation reversed the inhibitory effect of hucMSCs (Fig. 5C). The above findings confirmed that hucMSCs treatment alleviated pulmonary fibrosis by downregulating circFOXP1 in vivo.\ncircFOXP1-Mediated Inhibition of hucMSCs Treatment on Pulmonary Fibrosis by Promoting Human Antigen R (HuR)-Mediated Autophagy Process In our previous study,21 we reported that autophagy is repressed in pulmonary fibrosis. Thus, we investigated the circFOXP1-mediated mechanism of hucMSCs treatment on autophagy during pulmonary fibrogenesis. Microtubuleassociated protein 1 light chain 3 (LC3) is commonly used to label autophagosomes. Thus, the tandem dual-fluorescence HBAD-mcherry-EGFP-LC3 was performed to confirm the regulation of hucMSCs treatment on autophagy via circFOXP1. Images depicted that the normal group emitted red and yellow fluorescence. The number of yellow fluorescence spots were markedly increasing in the TGF-\u03b21 group compared with normal group, but the red fluorescence spots were markedly decreasing. The hucMSCs treatment caused an increase in red fluorescence spots and a decrease in yellow fluorescence spots (Fig. 6A), which implied that hucMSCs treatment enhanced the autophagy process. The rescue results of dual-fluorescence HBAD-mcherry-EGFP-LC3 showed that upregulated circFOXP1 caused a decrease in red fluorescence spots and an increase in yellow fluorescence spots. Findings proved the promoting effect of hucMSCs treatment on autophagy via downregulating circFOXP1.\nHuR can negatively regulate autophagy in pulmonary fibrosis. Thus, RIP experiment was performed to test the relation between circFOXP1 and HuR. The results confirmed\nmice. (D) Schematic illustration of injecting hucMSCs into mice.hucMSCs were injected into mice through the tail vein after 14 days of BLM spraying. The lung tissue was harvested after 28 days of BLM treatment.

(F) H&E and Masson staining results exhibited thickened alveolar wall, widened alveolar septum, large number of fibroblasts, and increased collagen deposition in the BLM-treated group.

Then, the effect of hucMSCs treatment on HuR was assessed. Western blot results discovered that hucMSCs treatment substantially reduced the HuR expression level in vivo and in vitro\n(Fig. 6C). The small interfering RNA of circFOXP1 also reduced HuR, and circFOXP1 overexpression promoted HuR (Fig. 6D). Nuclear-cytoplasmic separation results showed that HuR was located in the nucleus of normal cells\ncls/article/41/10/928/7221330 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 13 January 2024\nand transferred to the cytoplasm under TGF-\u03b21 treatment, whereas the hucMSCs treatment blocked the transfer process (Fig. 6E). The rescue experiment of nuclear-cytoplasmic separation demonstrated that circFOXP1 upregulation reversed the inhibitory effect of hucMSCs treatment on HuR nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (Fig. 6F), which suggested the inhibitory effect of hucMSCs treatment on nuclear HuR translocation via inhibiting circFOXP1. Immunofluorescence images further exhibited that HuR was located in the nucleus of normal cells and transferred to the cytoplasm after being treated with TGF-\u03b21, whereas hucMSCs treatment inhibited the transfer process (Fig. 6G). The rescue experiment of immunofluorescence images depicted that circFOXP1 upregulation reversed the inhibitory effect of hucMSCs treatment on nuclear HuR nucleocytoplasmic shuttling (Fig. 6H). Findings further proved the effect of hucMSCs treatment on nuclear HuR translocation through circFOXP1. The stability of HuR was performed using a cycloheximide experiment, and results discovered that TGF-\u03b21 promoted HuR stability and that HuR stability was weakened by hucMSCs treatment. The rescue experiment elucidated that the weakening trend caused by hucMSCs treatment was reversed by overexpressed circFOXP1, which implied that the effect of hucMSCs\ntreatment on HuR stability also depended on circFOXP1 (Fig. 7). The above findings indicated that hucMSCs treatment blocked nuclear HuR translocation from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Besides, hucMSCs treatment promoted HuR degradation via downregulating circFOXP1.\nhucMSCs Treatment Promoted Autophagy by Targeting Enhancer of Zeste Homolog 2 (EZH2), Signal Transducers and Activators of Transcription 1 (STAT1), and Forkhead box K1 (FOXK1) HuR can repress autophagy by controlling the target genes associated with autophagy, such as EZH2, STAT1, and FOXK1.21 Then, the effects of hucMSCs treatment on autophagy through the target genes EZH2, STAT1, and FOXK1 were further explored. Half-life experiments detected the mRNAs stabilities of EZH2, STAT1 and FOXK1. hucMSCs treatment reduced their stabilities. circFOXP1 overexpression promoted their stabilities and reversed the effect of hucMSCs treatment (Fig. 7A). Western blot results demonstrated that hucMSCs treatment reduced the expression levels of EZH2, STAT1, and FOXK1 in vivo and in vitro. Given that autophagic flux activated autophagy,\nFigure 5.

P62 and LC3-II/ LC3-I levels decreased in the normal group. P62, LC3-II, and LC3-I levels increased in the TGF-\u03b21/BLM-treated group compared with those in the normal group. P62, LC3-II, and LC3-I levels in the hucMSCs-treated group decreased compared with those in TGF-\u03b21/BLM-treated group (Fig. 7B). Gain- and loss-of-function studies revealed that si-circFOXP1 had the same effect as hucMSCs treatment, whereas circFOXP1 overexpression had the opposite effect of hucMSCs treatment (Fig. 7C). This finding implied that hucMSCs treatment and si-circFOXP1 enhanced autophagic flux via EZH2, STAT1, and FOXK1. The rescue experiment of circFOXP1 overexpression further elucidated that the enhancement effect of hucMSCs treatment on the target genes and autophagic flux depended on circFOXP1 (Fig. 7D).\nThe above findings demonstrated that autophagic flux was blocked, but the autophagosome accumulation was significantly increased in pulmonary fibrosis (Fig. 6A). Thus, we inferred that autophagy was blocked in the later stage and hucMSCs treatment promoted the autophagy process in pulmonary fibrosis. Next, the effects of hucMSCs treatment on the autophagy process were further analyzed by the expression of ATGs. Unc-51-like kinase 1 (ULK1) and ATG5 contributed to the early stage of autophagy, and DRAM2 and GABARAP helped in the autophagy via the autophagosome-lysosome fusion in the later stage. Western blot analysis revealed that ULK1 and ATG5 were increased by TGF-\u03b21 but decreased by hucMSCs treatment in vivo and in vitro. DRAM2 and GABARAP levels were decreased by TGF-\u03b21 but increased by hucMSCs treatment in vivo and in vitro (Fig. 7E). This finding confirmed that hucMSCs treatment promoted the autophagy process. Western blot analysis revealed that the effect of si-circFOXP1 was consistent with hucMSCs treatment. Thus, si-circFOXP1 reduced EZH2, STAT1, FOXK1, P62, LC3-II, LC3-I, ULK1, and ATG5 expression levels and enhanced DRAM2 and GABARAP expression levels. The effect of circFOXP1 overexpression was opposite to that of si-circFOXP1 (Fig. 7F). The rescue experiment of Western blot indicated that circFOXP1 overexpression reversed the effect of hucMSCs treatment on ULK1, ATG5, DRAM2, and GABARAP levels, which implied the effect of hucMSCs treatment on ATGs via circFOXP1 (Fig. 7G)."

            "text": "Currently, no effective therapeutic drug in the official clinical practice guideline has been recommended for pulmonary fibrosis.22-24 Clearly, the need for accelerated research into IPF treatment is unmet. hucMSCs have emerged as important stem cell therapy for disease due to their high differentiation potential, painless and easy collection procedure, minimal stringent requirements for HLA matching, and no ethical dilemma.25 Zhang et al described a case of a 56-year-old man with IPF who underwent hucMSCs intravenous\ninfusion and was followed up for 12 months.26 No adverse event is observed at 12 months post-infusion, and lung function, 6-min walking distance, and CT fibrosis score have increased from baseline. This case report provides useful clinical insight for the future efficacy trial of stem cell therapy in pulmonary fibrosis. In addition, numerous literatures indicate that hMSCs not only are primarily localized to the lung, liver, and spleen after intravenous infusion but also have characteristics of active chemotaxis and migration to injured tissues to play a therapeutic role.27-30 Yu C et al. reported the survival of the transplanted hMSCs labeled with gold nanoparticles in the IPF mice model for up to 10 days.31 DiI is a lipophilic membrane dye, which can be excited by strong fluorescence after entering the cell membrane and has strong stability. It is widely used as a longterm tracer in living cells. DiI-labeled nerve cells can remain for a year in the body. To detect the survival of hucMSCs in the lung, hucMSCs labeled with DiI were injected into mice through the tail vein after three days of BLM spraying in this study. Results showed that fluorescence was still present in the lung after 28 days of BLM treatment and hucMSCs are retained in the lung. However, the therapeutic mechanism of hucMSCs treatment in pulmonary fibrosis remains poorly understood, preventing its clinical application. In the present study, cultured hucMSCs are injected into the pulmonary fibrosis mice via the tail vein to investigate their role. Results illustrated that hucMSCs treatment improves the alveolar inflammation and alveolar structure, reduces the deposition of collagen fibers, and decreases the differentiation-related protein. Recent studies found that it is the secretion of stem cells that has biologically effective. Secretory factors are thought to cause tissue repair even in the absence of cells. A large amount of basic research supported the application of MSC-CM or cell exosomes in damaged organs or tissues,32,33 clinical trials have also shown promise for MSC-CM in promoting hair regeneration34 and wound healing,35 which has led to the investigation of conditioned medium as a cell substitute for regeneration purposes. In in vitro studies, hucMSCs supernatants were collected and applied to TGF-\u03b21-treated fibroblasts to investigate their effects. The results showed that hucMSCs supernatants treatment inhibited fibroblasts proliferation and migration and reduced the fibrosis-related protein. Mechanistic studies in vivo and in vitro further revealed that hucMSCs treatment ameliorates pulmonary fibrosis via downregulating the circFOXP1HuR-EZH2/STAT1/FOXK1 autophagic axis, in which hucMSCs treatment reduced the mRNAs stabilities of EZH2, STAT1, and FOXK1 by reducing circFOXP1-HuR stability, leading to blocked autophagy.\nThe autophagy process clears damaged organelles, intracellular abnormal proteins, or invading microorganisms. Dysfunctional autophagy causes the pathological accumulation of the cargo, which leads to human diseases, such as infectious diseases, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases.36 Hence, drugs that potentially modulate autophagy are increasingly being used in clinical trials, and screening for new\nhucMSCs treatment inhibited the transfer process.

Most studies indicated that the activation of autophagy helps in blocking pulmonary fibrosis.38,39 Zhang et al. explored that lncIAPF accelerates pulmonary fibrogenesis by blocking autophagosome fusion with lysosome and/or inhibiting the degradation of autophagosomes and showed that the knockdown of lncIAPF can enhance autophagy to attenuate pulmonary fibrosis.21 However, Tsubouchi et al elucidated that azithromycin alleviates lung fibrosis development by inhibiting autophagy and enhancing the unfolded protein response.40 To date, the roles of autophagy in the process of hucMSCs treatment attenuating pulmonary fibrosis and the mechanisms of hucMSCs treatment regulating autophagy are largely unknown. The present study proved that hucMSCs treatment activates the autophagy process to ameliorate pulmonary fibrosis via downregulating the circFOXP1-HuR-EZH2/ STAT1/FOXK1 autophagic axis.\nHuR is a potential therapeutic target candidate-related autophagy for disease therapy.41-43 However, inhibiting HuR may cause many side effects because of the central functions of HuR, such as controlling mRNA stability and the expression of various cytokines, proto-oncogenes, and growth factors. circRNA is usually expressed at lower levels than mRNA or protein. Therefore, circRNA-targeted treatment has more advantages than directly targeting mRNA or protein. For example, astilbin attenuates pulmonary fibrosis via circRNA-662 and 949 sponging the miR-29b targeting the Gli2 and STAT3 signal pathway.13 circANKRD42 mediates the crosstalk of mechanical stiffness and biochemical signal in lung fibrosis, and the knockdown of circANKRD42 can attenuate pulmonary fibrosis.14 Now, research articles about the relationship between hucMSCs treatment and circRNA are rare. In several articles, only the regulation of circRNA on hucMSCs differentiation, not hucMSCs treatment, is discussed.44-47 The role and mechanism of circRNA in hucMSCs treatment have not been reported. The present study illustrated that hucMSCs treatment ameliorates pulmonary fibrosis via blocking nuclear HuR translocation from the nucleus to cytoplasm and promoting HuR degradation depending on circFOXP1. EZH2, STAT1, and FOXK1 are the target genes of HuR, as proven by HuR RNA-binding protein immunoprecipitation (RIP) sequencing and RIPPCR,21 and are autophagy-negative regulators. This study further elucidated that hucMSCs treatment enhances the autophagy process by inhibiting the HuR level, leading to a marked decrease in EZH2/STAT1/FOXK1 expression via circFOXP1."
