Large discontinuities in the bulk moduli at the Ne\u0301el transitions indicate strong magnetoelastic coupling in both compounds. Strikingly, the discontinuities are nearly a factor of 10 larger in Mn3Ge than in Mn3Sn. We use the magnitudes of the discontinuities to calculate the pressure derivatives of the Ne\u0301el temperature, which are 39 K/GPa 14.3 K/GPa for Mn3Ge and Mn3Sn, respectively. We measured the in-plane shear modulus c66, which couples strongly to the magnetic order, in magnetic fields up to 18 T and found quantitatively similar behavior in both compounds. Recent measurements have demonstrated strong piezomagnetism in Mn3Sn: our results suggest that Mn3Ge may be an even better candidate for this effect.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nElastic strains offer a fast, local, and reversible way to manipulate the magnetic properties of solids. On a microscopic level, strains alter bond distances and the angles between magnetic ions, leading to changes in magnetic exchange coupling and magnetic anisotropy [1]. On a phenomenological level, these effects can lead to a strain dependence of the critical temperature and of the total magnetic moment. In the most extreme case, externally applied strains can break the crystal symmetry and drive magnetic phase transitions. The strain-dependence of the magnetization most commonly comes in the form of magnetostriction, piezomagnetism, or flexomagnetism. All of these effects find useful applications in the recentlyemerging field of straintronics [2, 3]. This necessitates the search for materials with large magnetoelastic coupling.\nIn this regard, the noncollinear antiferromagnets Mn3X (X = Ge, Sn) are promising candidates. 120\n\u25e6 triangular magnetic order forms in these compounds well above room temperature. This magnetic order is the source of several anomalous transport properties including giant anomalous Hall, Nernst, and thermal Hall effects [4\u201311]. These quantities were recently shown to be strongly strain dependent. For example, dos Reis et al. [12] demonstrated the ability to change the sign of the Hall angle in Mn3Ge by applying hydrostatic pressure, and Ikhlas et al. [13] switched the sign of the Hall coefficient in Mn3Sn by applying uniaxial strain. Additional evidence for large magnetoelastic coupling has been found in neutron diffraction studies [14], as well as in spontaneous magnetostriction at TN [15] in Mn3Ge. Most recently, Mn3Sn was found to exhibit an extraordinarily large piezomagnetic effect [13]. These findings reveal an intimate connection between magnetism, anoma-\n\u2217 bradramshaw@cornell.edu\nlous transport properties, and elastic strain in Mn3X, making it a prime candidate for applications in straintronics.\nWhile many anomalous transport coefficients have been documented in Mn3X, the fundamental quantity relating stress and strain\u2014the elastic tensor\u2014has not been measured. From a practical standpoint, the elastic moduli are needed to convert stress\u2014the quantity typically known in an experiment\u2014to strain. From a fundamental standpoint, elastic moduli are a powerful thermodynamic probe into the symmetry breaking at the magnetic phase transition.\nWe directly measure the full elastic tensors of Mn3Ge and Mn3Sn through the respective phase transitions. We study the elastic moduli using resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) and pulse-echo ultrasound. We find large discontinuities at TN in the compressional elastic moduli and, using Ehrenfest relations, relate them to large derivatives of the Ne\u0301el temperature with respect to hydrostatic pressure. We calculate dTN/dP to be roughly 39 K/GPa in Mn3Ge and 14.3 K/GPa in Mn3Sn\u2014some of the largest values ever reported for itinerant antiferromagnets. We measure c66\u2014corresponding to the strain that switches the sign of the anomalous Hall coefficient [13]\u2014in magnetic fields up to 18 tesla. We find that, while the elastic moduli of Mn3Ge and Mn3Sn exhibit large quantitative differences in zero field, their magnetic field dependencies are quite similar.\nThis paper is structured as follows: in section II we describe our pulse-echo and RUS measurements and how our data is analyzed. In section III we describe the measured elastic moduli and their temperature dependencies. We analyze the temperature dependencies quantitatively in section IV. We analyze the magnetic field dependence of c66 in section V. Finally, we summarize our conclusions in section VI.\n2"

            "text": "Mn3X (X = Ge, Sn) crystallizes with a hexagonal unit cell (point group D6h Figure 1 a), with lattice parameters a = 5.3 A\u030a and c = 4.3 A\u030a for Mn3Ge [16], and a = 5.7 A\u030a and c = 4.5 A\u030a for Mn3Sn [17]. Mn atoms form a Kagome lattice in the a-b plane, and local moments on the Mn sites order in a chiral antiferromagnetic stucture (Figure 1 b) [18, 19], with a small in-plane magnetic moment due to spin canting [20]. Neutron diffraction studies find a magnetic order parameter of the E1g representation in the D6h point group [19, 21]. The Ne\u0301el temperature (TN ) for Mn3Ge is 370 K. For Mn3Sn, TN depends strongly on the exact stochiometry: here we investigated Mn3.019Sn0.981 with a critical temperature of 415 K. This composition of Mn3Sn features an additional phase transition to spiral spin order below about 270 K [22, 23]. For simplicity, we will refer to Mn3.019Sn0.981 as Mn3Sn for the remainder of this paper.\nThe strain tensor in D6h consists of four independent elements. Linear combinations of these form irreducible representations (irreps, Figure 1c). The irreps are divided into two one-component compressional strains that transform as the A1g irrep, and two twocomponent shear strains transforming as the E1g (outof-plane shear) and E2g (in-plane shear) irreps. The elastic moduli corresponding to each irrep are defined according to c\u0393 = \u2202\n2F/\u2202\u03b52\u0393, where F is the free energy and \u0393 labels the irreps. The resulting elastic moduli are cA1g,1 = (c11 + c12) /2, cA1g,2 = c33, cE1g = c44, and cE2g = c66 = (c11 \u2212 c12) /2. An additional, fifth elastic modulus, cA1g,3 = c13, couples the in-plane and out-ofplane compressional strains. Figure 1c illustrates these irreducible strains, provides their definitions in terms of the strains \u03b5ij , and gives the corresponding elastic moduli.\nWe measured the temperature dependence of the the full elastic tensor using resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS). In RUS, a sample is placed on its corners in weak mechanical contact between two piezoelectric transducers to provide nearly-free elastic boundary conditions. One transducer is driven at a fixed frequency and the resulting charge generated at the other transducer is detected using a custom-built charge amplifier and digital lockin (the amplifier and lockin are described in Balakirev et al. [24]). By sweeping the drive frequency in the range of 0.1 to 5 MHz, we can measure the lowest mechanical resonance frequencies of a three-dimensional solid. From these resonance frequencies, we then determine the elastic moduli by inverse-solving the elastic wave equation (see [25, 26] for details on technique and data analysis). In contrast to the conventional pulse-echo ultrasound technique, where only one elastic modulus is measured at a time, RUS allows the extraction of the temperature dependence of the full elastic tensor with one experiment.\nTo access the relatively high Ne\u0301el temperatures of Mn3X, we built an RUS apparatus inside an insulated box on a hotplate (see SI for pictures of the measurement setup). The temperature was monitored with a\nLakeshore PT100 platinum resistance thermometer and recorded with a Cryocon Model 22C temperature controller. For the fits of the elastic tensor, we used the lowest resonance frequencies up to 4 MHz in both compounds. This included 84 resonances for Mn3Ge and 68 for Mn3Sn. Our fits converged with root mean square errors of 0.18 % (387 K) and 0.42 % (300 K) for Mn3Ge, and 0.23 % (438 K) and 0.48 % (300 K) for Mn3Sn. More details, including a full list of experimental and calculated resonances, can be found in the SI.\nThe requirement of weak mechanical contact between transducers and the sample makes it difficult to reliably perform RUS in magnetic fields. To measure the c66 elastic modulus as a function of magnetic field, we employed the pulse-echo ultrasound technique [27]. Ultrasound waves were generated by 41\u25e6 X-cut LiNbO3 shear transducers with a fundamental frequency of 40 MHz, purchased from Boston Piezo-Optics Inc. The transducers were driven at 199 MHz for Mn3Ge and at 175 MHz\n3 for Mn3Sn. The transducers were glued to polished surfaces of the sample, perpendicular to the c-axis, using Angstro\u0308mBond AB9110LV from Fiber Optic Center Inc. Short (80 ns) bursts of ultrasound were generated from the transducer using a Tektronix TSG 4106A RF generator and amplified with a Mini-Circuits ZHL-42W+ power amplifier. The ultrasonic echoes are detected using the same transducer, amplified with a Mini-Circuits ZX60-3018G-S+ amplifier and captured on a Tektronix MSO64 oscilloscope. A software lockin is used to track phase changes in the echoes as a function of temperature and magnetic field, allowing relative changes in the sound velocity, \u2206v/v, to be measured with a precision of better than one part in 106. In this configuration, we measure changes in v66, which are converted to the associated elastic modulus change by \u2206c66/c66 = 2\u2206v66/v66.\nThe pulse-echo measurements were performed with a custom high-temperature probe in an Oxford Instruments variable temperature insert (VTI) in an Oxford Instruments 20 Tesla superconducting magnet system. The sample space of the VTI was pumped continuously throughout the experiment to ensure high vacuum. We performed these measurements with an in-plane magnetic field applied parallel to the polarization vector of the sound wave (and perpendicular to the direction of sound propagation)."

In their respective paramagnetic states, the compresional elastic moduli, (c11 + c12) /2 and c33, are 13 % and 28 % larger in Mn3Ge than in Mn3Sn. This implies tighter bonding in Mn3Ge, which is also consistent with its smaller unit cell. The value of the in-plane Poisson ratio, \u03bdxy, is consistent with what is found in most conventional metals [28]. \u03bdzx on the other hand, is anomalously small, even compared to other layered materials like Sr2RuO4 (\u03bdzx = 0.16 [26]), URu2Si2 (\u03bdzx = 0.20 [29]), CeIrIn5 (\u03bdzx = 0.32 [30]), and La2CuO4 (\u03bdzx = 0.21 [31]), implying extremely weak elastic coupling between different planes in the hexagonal crystal structure of Mn3X.\nTo investigate the coupling between magnetism and elasticity in Mn3X, we first measured the elastic moduli as a function of temperature through their respective Ne\u0301el temperatures TN (see Figure 2).\nWe first discuss the temperature dependence of the compressional elastic moduli (upper panels of Figure 2). Starting well above TN , all three compressional moduli in Mn3Ge decrease smoothly upon cooling towards the phase transition. This anomalous softening is in contrast to the conventional stiffening of elastic moduli when the temperature is lowered [32], and implies sizable antiferromagnetic fluctuations well above TN . Anomalous softening of the elastic moduli approaching TN also suggest\na non-mean-field phase transition in Mn3Ge. The softening of the compressional moduli above TN is followed by a step-like feature at the phase transition.\nQualitatively similar behavior is seen in Mn3Sn, but with quantitative differences. In Mn3Sn, c13 and (c11 + c12) /2 are almost temperature independent well above TN , and c33 increases upon cooling. All compressional elastic moduli eventually soften above TN , but much more weakly than in Mn3Ge. Additionally, the absolute sizes of the steps at TN are nearly a factor of 10 smaller in Mn3Sn than in Mn3Ge. Both the smaller precursor softening and the smaller steps at TN suggest that the coupling between magnetism and the lattice is significantly stronger in Mn3Ge than in Mn3Sn.\nWe now turn to the shear moduli (lower panels in Figure 2). The behavior of c44 is relatively conventional, with no precursor softening and only a change in slope at TN . c66, on the other hand, softens towards the Ne\u0301el temperature upon cooling, similar to the compressional modes. The much stronger signature in Mn3Ge than in Mn3Sn again indicates stronger magnetoelastic coupling in the former compound. While a step in c66 at TN is allowed by symmetry for the chiral order in Mn3X [13, 33, 34], no feature that is comparable in width to the steps in the compressional moduli is seen in c66 (see SI for a derivation of which moduli can show discontinuous jumps at the phase transition). Note that the E2g strain associated with c66 is the same strain that is responsible for the piezomagnetic effect and the switching of the anomalous Hall effect. The precursor softening in this channel again indicates the non-mean-field nature of the magnetic phase transition in Mn3X, and will be the subject of a future study."

            "text": "The discontinuities in the compressional moduli at TN are indicative of a second-order phase transition and are reminiscent of a heat capacity anomaly [35]. Indeed, Ehrenfest relations require that the changes in the heat capacity and in the compressional moduli across TN are proportional to each other, and the coefficient of proportionality is the square of the derivative of TN with respect to hydrostatic pressure Phydro. Using the measured heat capacity and our measurements of the compressional moduli, we can calculate dTN/dPhydro.\nThe Ehrenfest relation between the bulk modulus and heat capacity discontinuities is [26](\ndTN dPhydro\n)2 = \u2212\u2206B\nB2\n( \u2206C\nTN\n)\u22121 , (1)\nwhere \u2206B and \u2206C are the discontinuities in the bulk modulus and specific heat, respectively, and B is the absolute bulk modulus at TN .\nTo extract the derivative of the Ne\u0301el temperature with hydrostatic pressure from our data, we plot the bulk modulus B/B (TN ) 2 on the same scale as the specific heat\n2 . We show full temperature\ndependences of the Poisson\u2019s ratios and the bulk moduli in the SI.\nMn3Ge\nMn3Sn\nscaled by dTN/dPhydro, i.e. \u2212\u2206C/TN (dTN/dPhydro)2 (see Figure 3 and footnote [36]). This analysis for Mn3Ge, along with the specific heat data for Mn3Ge from Chen et al. [19], is shown in the main panel of Figure 3. We extract a derivative of TN with respect to pressure of dTN/dPhydro = 39\u00b1 3 K/GPa.\nSpecific heat data are not available for Mn3Sn through its high temperature phase transition. However, using the specific heat data for Mn3Ge, we estimate dTN/dPhydro \u2248 (14.3\u00b1 2) K/GPa for Mn3Sn (see inset of Figure 3). This value is about a factor of three smaller than for Mn3Ge. It is possible that the true heat capacity of Mn3Sn is a factor of 9 larger than in Mn3Ge. Either way\u2014whether it is due to a factor of 9 difference in heat capacity or a factor of 3 difference in dTN/dPhydro\u2014this\nobservation is puzzling given that the two compounds share similar values of TN , the same room-temperature magnetic structure, and the same crystal structure with only marginally different unit cell parameters.\nTable II compares the size of dTN/dPhydro between several metallic antiferromagnets. Mn3Ge and Mn3Sn stand out with some of the largest pressure derivatives of their respective Ne\u0301el temperatures. Only the alloy Mn3Pt and elemental chromium have transition temperatures more sensitive to pressure than Mn3Ge. Note that these compounds and Mn3X are also the only materials with transitions above room temperature. These features, as well as their metallic conductivity, make Mn3Ge and Mn3Sn two of only a few materials exceptionally well suited for applications in straintronics.\n5 0.02 0.00 0.02 0.04 (T TN)/TN 1.6 1.7 1.8 1.9 2.0 B/ B 2 T N ( 10 2 /G Pa ) Mn3Ge ( C/T N )\u00d7 (dT N /dP) 2 0.04 0.00 0.04 1.70 1.72 1.74 1.76 1.78 Mn3Sn\nV. c66 IN MAGNETIC FIELD\nThe in-plane shear strain, \u03b5E2g = {\u03b5xx \u2212 \u03b5yy, 2\u03b5xy}, plays a special role in the coupling between magnetism and strain in Mn3X. Unlike most shear strains in magnetic systems, \u03b5E2g can couple to the magnetic order parameter \u03b7 = {\u03b7x, \u03b7y} as ((\u03b5xx\u2212\u03b5yy)(\u03b72x\u2212\u03b72y)+4\u03b5xy\u03b7x\u03b7y) within a Landau free energy. This type of coupling\u2014 linear in shear strain and quadratic in order parameter\u2014 can reorient the magnetic moments on the Kagome lat-\ntice and align domains [13, 33]. Ikhlas et al. [13] used \u03b5E2g strain to change the sign of the Hall coefficient and to find a large piezomagnetic effect in Mn3Sn. This motivates a measurement of the associated elastic modulus, c66, in external magnetic fields.\nThe inset to Figure 4 shows the change in c66 as a function of temperature in zero magnetic field for Mn3Ge and Mn3Sn, measured with pulse-echo ultrasound. The main panel of Figure 4 shows this temperature dependence at different magnetic fields with the zero-field data subtracted from each curve. The data are shown as a function of the reduced temperature (T \u2212TN )/TN above their respective phase transitions. The data end at (or just before) TN because the ultrasonic attenuation becomes too large to resolve a clear signal in the ordered phase.\nAs noted earlier, the temperature dependence of c66 in zero field shows much stronger precursor fluctuations in Mn3Ge than in Mn3Sn. However, once we account for this difference in the zero-field temperature dependence, the change with magnetic field is quite similar for the two compounds. With increasing magnetic field, the softening towards TN becomes more pronounced. This behavior is reminiscent of ferromagnetic transitions and is indicative of the trilinear coupling allowed by symmetry between shear strain, magnetic order parameter, and the external field in Mn3X (see SI for a description of this coupling)."

We find an anomalously small out-of-plane Poisson\u2019s ratio, \u03bdzx, in both materials, implying weak elastic coupling between different layers of the hexagonal crystal structure. By scaling the bulk modulus anomalies to match the heat capacity anomaly at TN , we extract large derivatives of the Ne\u0301el temperatures with respect to hydrostatic pressure: (39\u00b1 3) K/GPa and (14.3\u00b1 2.0) K/GPa in Mn3Ge and Mn3Sn, respectively. Finally, although the zero-field magneto-elastic coupling appears to be much larger in Mn3Ge than in Mn3Sn, we find that the field dependence of the in-plane shear modulus\u2014associated with the strain that couples strongly to the magnetism in Mn3X\u2014is similar in the two compounds.\nThe Mn3X family hold promise for straintronic applications because it combines metallic conductivity, robust room-temperature magnetism, a large anomalous Hall effect whose sign can be switched with strain, and strong piezomagnetism. The latter two properties\u2014 piezomagnetism and strain dependence of anomalous transport properties [13]\u2014have only been performed on Mn3Sn.

It consists of a large copper mount placed on a hotplate and insulated with firebricks. Ultrasound was created by two compressional-mode lithium niobate transducers glued to stainless steel rods with ceramic epoxy. These transducer rods were placed in the copper mount such such that free vertical motion was allowed for the top transducer. The single crystal sample was mounted on its corners between the transducers to ensure nearly-free elastic boundary conditions for the sample.\nWe use the output of a custom-built lockin amplifier to excite one transducer at a fixed frequency and detect the quadrature response of the other transducer. We measure both in-phase (X) and out-of-phase (Y) components of the response. We achieve a full frequency sweep by stepping the drive frequency from about 100 kHz to\n5 MHz. More details on the technique can be found in [25, 46].\nFigure 6 shows the amplitude (X2+Y2) of an exemplary frequency sweep. We can identify mechanical resonances of the sample as frequencies at which maximum transmission between the drive and receive transducers occurs. From the position of these resonances we determine the full elastic tensor by inverse solving the elastic wave equation [25, 46]. Lists of all experimental resonances included in the fit, alongside the calculated resonances and their differences, are shown in the supplemental material [47].\nEach resonance is a function of the density and dimensions of the sample, as well as all elastic moduli. We quantify the composition, \u03b1i,\u00b5, of each resonance fi by the logarithmic derivative with respect to the elastic moduli c\u00b5\n\u03b1i,\u00b5 = \u2202 ( ln f2i ) \u2202 (ln c\u00b5) , (A1)\nwith \u2211 \u00b5 \u03b1i,\u00b5 = 1. These \u03b1-coefficients are essentially geometric factors and depend only weakly on temperature. The temperature dependence of the resonance frequencies is therefore entirely determined by the temperature dependence of the elastic moduli and we can write\n2\u2206fi(T ) f0i = \u2211 \u00b5 \u03b1i,\u00b5 \u2206c\u00b5 c0\u00b5 .

We compute these \u03b1-coefficients by taking logarithmic derivatives of the calculated resonance frequencies at the elastic moduli returned by our fit. Specific values for all measured resonance frequencies are shown in [47]. With this analysis and Equation A2, we determined the temperature dependence of all elastic moduli.

            "text": "To estimate the behaviour of the elastic moduli through the phase transition, we consider the free energy at zero field, and constant angles \u03c6h, \u03c6\u03b7, and \u03c6\u03b5, which\n10\nare the constraints of our ultrasound measurements. In this case, the free energy given by Equation D26 simplifies to\nF = 1\n2\n( cA1g,1\u03b5 2 A1g,1 + cA1g,2\u03b5 2 A1g,2 (E1)\n+2cA1g,3\u03b5A1g,1\u03b5A1g,2 + cE1g |\u03b5E1g|2 + cE2g |\u03b5E2g|2 ) + \u03b1 (T \u2212 TN ) \u03b72 + \u03b2\u03b74 + 3\u2211 i=1 \u03b3A1g,i\u03b5A1g,i\u03b7 2\n+ \u03b3E1g \u2223\u2223\u03b52E1g\u2223\u2223 \u03b72 + \u03b3E2g\u03b72\u03b5E2g\n\u2212 2\u2211 i=1 \u03bbA1g,i\u03b5A1g,i\u03b7h\u2212 \u03bb\u03b5E2g\u03b7h,\nwhere the cosine terms from Equation D26 are absorbed into the expansion coefficients. We find the equilibrium order parameter, \u03b7eq, through (dF/d\u03b7)|\u03b7eq = 0, and the\nelastic moduli c\u0393 are defined through ( \u22022F/\u2202\u03b52\u0393 )\u2223\u2223 \u03b7eq .\nFor \u03b5A1g and \u03b5E2g strains, which couple linearly to the square of the order parameter as \u03b5\u0393\u03b7\n2, we find a step discontinuity in the temperature dependence of their respective elastic moduli at the phase transition\n\u2206c\u0393 = (c\u0393 (T > TN )\u2212 c\u0393 (T < TN ))T\u2192TN = 2\u03b32\u0393 \u03b2 .\n(E2) However, for cE1g whose corresponding strain couples to the order parameter as |\u03b5E1g|2 \u03b72 to lowest order, this mean-field analysis yields\n\u2206cE1g = [cE1g (T > TN )\u2212 cE1g (T < TN )]T\u2192TN = 0. (E3) We therefore expect to see only a change in slope in the temperature dependence of cE1g at TN .\n[1] C. Song, Y. You, X. Chen, X. Zhou, Y. Wang, and F.

[36] For mean-field like transitions, the discontinuities in thermodynamic coefficients are easily defined as the difference in the coefficient immediately above and below the transition. In the case of Mn3X, the transition does not appear mean-field like. We therefore use this scaling procedure to avoid ambiguity in the definition of the discontinuity, as the non-mean field \u201crounding\u201d is approximately the same in the specific heat and the bulk modulus.
