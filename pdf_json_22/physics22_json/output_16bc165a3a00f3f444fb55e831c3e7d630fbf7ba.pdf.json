    "abstractText": "Assuming only a known dispersion relation of a single mode in the spectrum of a meromorphic two-point function (in the complex frequency plane at fixed wavevector) in some quantum field theory, we investigate when and how the reconstruction of the complete spectrum of physical excitations is possible. In particular, we develop a constructive algorithm based on the theorems of Darboux and Puiseux that allows for such a reconstruction of all modes connected by level-crossings. For concreteness, we focus on theories in which the known mode is a gapless excitation described by the hydrodynamic gradient expansion, known at least to some (preferably high) order. We first apply the algorithm to a simple algebraic example and then to the transverse momentum excitations in the holographic theory that describes a stack of M2 branes and includes momentum diffusion as its gapless excitation.",

            "text": "Reconstruction of spectra of linear operators [1], given some partial information about its structure, is an old problem. A typical example of such a question in physics may be stated as follows. Imagine a quantum mechanical system with some Hamiltonian that has a corresponding set of energy eigenvalues En. Now assume that we know one of the eigenvalues as a function of some parameter, such as the coupling constant \u03bb. For example, we may imagine that we know the ground state energy E0(\u03bb) given as a power series in \u03bb. Using the knowledge of E0, can one determine the remaining eigenvalues En\u22651(\u03bb) from\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 1\nE0, thereby reconstructing the full spectrum? Among many works, the problem of this type was considered in a \u2018physically transparent manner\u2019 in a series of seminal papers by Bender and Wu [2\u20134]. Crucially, those papers explicitly pointed towards the necessity for complexifying the coupling constant \u03bb \u2208 C and showed why complex analytic properties of En were essential for answering such questions.1 In particular, the reconstruction can only follow from the intricate \u2018level-crossing\u2019 branch cut structure of the Riemann surface E0(\u03bb) and its relation to the remaining Riemann surfaces En\u22651(\u03bb). Since perturbative series in powers of \u03bb are typically asymptotic series with zero radii of convergence, these types of problems are intimately related with the field of resurgence in quantum mechanics and quantum field theory (see refs. [6\u20139]). Along similar lines, resurgence has also been a fruitful tool for analysing hydrodynamics and its extensions, particularly in the context of holography (see refs. [10\u201321]). Among those and related studies, the best understood cases usually pertain to boost invariant (Bjorken-like) flows in \u2018position space\u2019 where one complexifies the proper time \u03c4 \u2208 C. What most of the above quantum mechanical, quantum field theoretic, hydrodynamic and holographic studies share is the necessity for analysing asymptotic series, usually by the methods of Pad\u00e9 approximants, the Borel resummation and constructions of transseries that contain the knowledge of higher-energy modes.\nInstead, one may ask in an analogous manner whether the spectrum of a quantum field theory (QFT) correlation function in momentum (Fourier) space (\u03c9,q) can be reconstructed from the knowledge of a single mode\u2019s dispersion relation \u03c9(q), where we define q \u2261 |q| = \u221a q2. If position space and coupling constant \u2018space\u2019 allow for such (at least partial) reconstructions, there is no reason to expect that this should be any different in momentum space. This question was recently considered in ref. [22], where the reconstruction of the first gapped mode\u2019s dispersion relation in the spectrum of a two-point function was successfully worked out from the dispersion relation of a gapless hydrodynamic mode in a holographic model. There, the chosen method of analytic continuation that allowed for the reconstruction was again the Pad\u00e9 approximant, however, this time, from the Riemann surface of a gapless \u03c9(q), which had a convergent series representation around q = 0.\nIn this paper, we consider the same type of question. Our first goal is to make a general statement for when a (complete) reconstruction of momentum space dispersion relations contained in correlation functions is possible in theories that exhibit \u2018similar\u2019 types of spectra to those seen in holographic models. By \u2018similar\u2019 types of spectra, we mean that the correlators only contain poles (are meromorphic) in some complexified parameter space, typically, the frequency. Our second goal is to develop a practical (if somewhat more involved) algorithm that is not based on the method of Pad\u00e9 approximants. What we propose is a series of steps that allows for a more direct and rigorous control of all properties of Puiseux series expansions around different critical (branch) points of the Riemann surface, where each step of the reconstruction takes place. Concretely, we will build on a series of recent holographic insights and methods used in refs. [23\u201325], which combine two results\n1It is worth noting that, earlier, Dyson also argued for the divergence of perturbative series based on the analytic structure of quantum electrodynamics for \u2018complexified\u2019 coupling [5].\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 1\nin complex analysis. Firstly, we will employ the techniques that established, in general, the convergence of classical hydrodynamic dispersion relations through the use of complex spectral curve methods and the Puiseux theorem. Secondly, we will use the theorem of Darboux that can be used to understand all details of a dispersion relation in the vicinity of the critical point limiting its convergence. As we will see, for modes in the spectrum that are connected with the same (part of) a non-factorised spectral curve, the reconstruction is possible due to the fact that different physical modes are connected via level-crossings \u2014 i.e., they are all parts of \u2018the same\u2019 Riemann surface. On the other hand, when different modes at certain critical points only experience, in the language of [24], \u2018level-touching\u2019, then the reconstruction is not possible. This is due to the factorisation of the associated spectral curve. While our discussion and examples will be closely motivated by holographic theories where our ideas can be explicitly tested, these methods can also be applicable to a variety of theories, most obviously QFTs which allow for a gradient expanded EFT similar to the hydrodynamic expansion. Moreover, we believe that the procedure (the algorithm) that we outline here can be used rather generally in a variety of circumstances when the problem of a spectral reconstruction is considered. This paper is structured as follows. In section 2, we set up the problem and outline our general strategy and arguments for the reconstruction based on the theorems of Darboux and Puiseux. Then, in section 3, we develop the details of the Darboux theorem and in section 4 consider specific examples that demonstrate the algorithm. Our main physical example is the reconstruction of the spectrum of the transverse momentum, finite temperature retarded two-point function in a holographic large-N 3d conformal field theory (CFT) describing a stack of M2 branes from the structure of the hydrodynamic diffusive mode first studied in ref. [26]. Finally, in section 5, we summarise our results and discuss their potential future applications. At the end of the paper, we also include three appendices. In appendix A, we discuss certain specific amendments to the reconstruction algorithm that need to be taken into account when the original dispersion relation is a Puiseux and not a Taylor series. In appendix B, we present a variant of the algorithm applicable to cases with two critical points limiting the convergence of the original series. Finally, in appendix C, we discuss certain aspects of the reconstruction algorithm using the method of Pad\u00e9 approximants instead of the Darboux theorem. There, we also compare the effectiveness of the two methods when applied to the holographic example studied in section 4.2."

            "text": "Consider an operator O(t,x) in some d-dimensional quantum field theory (QFT) with an associated two-point Green\u2019s function in Fourier space. To enable the considerations of thermal states or states with finite density, we allow for the Lorentz invariance to be broken. The Fourier space can then be parametrised with frequency \u03c9 and vector momentum (wavevector) squared q2, where, for concreteness, we have assumed that the theory remains rotationally invariant under spatial SO(d\u2212 2). In what is to follow, it will be essential to\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 1\nconsider \u03c9 and q, or a frequently used new variable z \u2261 q2 = q2, as complexified. The Green\u2019s function of interest is then G(\u03c9, z) \u2261 \u3008O(\u03c9, q)O(\u2212\u03c9,\u2212q)\u3009. In general, the complex analytic structure of G(\u03c9, z) in an interacting, potentially strongly coupled QFT can be extremely complicated. The structures in both \u03c9 and z spaces can include infinite numbers of zeros, poles or branch points with a complicated branch cut (Riemann surface) structure (see discussions in refs. [27\u201331]). With a view towards thermal holographic large-N theories, the most obvious prototypical example being the N = 4 supersymmetric Yang-Mills theory (SYM), here, we will assume that G(\u03c9, z) is a meromorphic function (without branch cuts) in the complex \u03c9 plane. Note that this assumption is for example violated in a zero temperature CFT. For present purposes, our assumption implies that the spectrum of physical excitations (the modes) is determined by the set of M poles of G(\u03c9, z), which allows us to write\nG(\u03c9, z) = B(\u03c9, z)\u220fM i=0 (\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9i(z)) . (2.1)\nThis set can be, and often is, infinite, i.e., M \u2192 \u221e. On the other hand, B(\u03c9, z) can have infinitely many zeros but has no additional poles except potentially at infinity.2 The functions \u03c9i(z) are called the dispersion relations of the modes. The problem that we wish to address can now be stated as follows. Assume that we know the dispersion relation of one of the modes, call it \u03c90(z). Can we use the information contained solely in the function \u03c90(z) to find all (or some of the) other dispersion relations \u03c9i(z), for i \u2265 1, and thereby reconstruct the entire (or partial) spectrum of G(\u03c9, z)? The fairly obvious answer to this question is: yes, this is possible for the set of \u03c9i that are connected to \u03c90 via a sequence of consecutive level-crossings. If this set contains all \u03c9i, for 1 \u2264 i \u2264M (with M \u2192\u221e possible as well), then we can reconstruct the entire spectrum. We now explain more concretely what we mean by the above statement. The relevant language and tools that we will employ can be found in refs. [23\u201325]. The spectrum of G(\u03c9, z) follows from its associated complex spectral curve P (\u03c9, z), with \u03c9 \u2208 C and z \u2208 C. The zeros of P (\u03c9, z) are then the poles of the correlator G(\u03c9, z):3\nP (\u03c9 = \u03c9i(z), z) = 0. (2.2)\nThe spectral curve can also be used to compute the critical points, which satisfy the equation\nP (\u03c9 = \u03c9i(z), z) = 0, \u2202\u03c9P (\u03c9 = \u03c9i(z), z) = 0, . . . , \u2202p\u03c9P (\u03c9 = \u03c9i(z), z) 6= 0. (2.3)\nThe integer p is called the order of the critical point. In terms of the modes\u2019 dispersion relations, critical points are the locations where, out of the full spectrum of modes, two (for p = 2) or more (for p > 2) modes \u2018collide\u2019 in the (\u03c9, z) space. In the language of [24],\n2Note that for some values of z, we can have B(\u03c9 = \u03c9i(z), z) = 0. These are the pole-skipping points of the correlator G(\u03c9, z) [32\u201335]. For each i, there may in fact exist infinitely many such solutions for z [24, 36].\n3For example, in the language of holographic calculations, eq. (2.2) is the quasinormal mode condition applied to a gauge invariant mode at the asymptotic anti-de Sitter boundary [37].\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 1\nsuch collision points can be either of the \u2018level-crossing\u2019 or the \u2018level-touching\u2019 type. The former, which can be understood as having a non-trivial monodromy, are responsible for the breakdown of convergence of a series representation of \u03c9i(z) (for details, see refs. [24, 25] and also [38]). From the point of view of the analytic structure of dispersion relations, the level-crossing points are the branch points of the Riemann surface and will therefore play a central role in our analysis. At a critical point z1 of order p, the Puiseux theorem states that there are p solutions to the equation (2.2), corresponding to p branches of the Riemann surface defined by (2.2), given by convergent Puiseux series\n\u03c9j(z) = \u03c9(z1) + \u221e\u2211\nk\u2265k0 ak (z \u2212 z1)k/mj , j = 1, . . . , p, (2.4)\nwhere mj are positive integers and, in general, k0 can depend on j. Crucially, then, if some mj > 1 exists, we will necessarily have among p branches \u03c9j a family of mj solutions of the form\n\u03c9l(z) = \u03c9(z1) + \u221e\u2211 k\u2265k0 ak ( e2\u03c0il/mj )k (z \u2212 z1)k/mj , l = 0, 1, . . . ,mj \u2212 1. (2.5)\nThe latter part of the theorem of Puiseux will be of central importance to the entire reconstruction algorithm discussed in this work. In practice, having access to any exact dispersion relation is extremely rare. More commonly, we employ the tools of effective field theory (EFT), like hydrodynamics, to write a series representation of \u03c9i(z) in powers of z. Such an expansion is particularly natural in the low-energy limit since it stems from a derivative (gradient) expansion of relevant fields in position space. By assuming that this is a convenient expansion of the mode \u03c90(z), we can then express its dispersion relation as\n\u03c90(z) = \u221e\u2211 n=0 anz n, (2.6)\nwhere the coefficients an must be computed from the underlying microscopic theory. What is essential for the usefulness of this procedure is that, for example, in hydrodynamics, the coefficients an can be computed as the \u03c9 \u2192 0 and q \u2192 0 limits of various (fully retarded) higher-point correlation functions by using the analogues of the Kubo formulae and linear response theory. In a thermal QFT, this is incomparably easier than obtaining a two-point function for general \u03c9 and q (see e.g. refs. [39\u201343]). In eq. (2.6), we have assumed that the series (2.6) is a Taylor series in z = q2, which amounts to assuming that (\u03c9 = 0, z = 0) is a regular point (p = 1 in (2.3)) of the spectral curve. We discuss the relevant techniques and small extensions of our algorithm that are required when the (\u03c9 = 0, z = 0) point is a critical point with p \u2265 2 in appendix A. Note that from the mathematical point of view, the fact that we assume that \u03c90 is given as a series around z = 0 can be seen as a matter of convenience. All of our results could also be derived from the knowledge of \u03c90 expanded around any other point, as well as, clearly,\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 1\nfrom \u03c90 given in its exact form. Note further that in the cases that we consider here, which are motivated by hydrodynamics, \u03c90 will be a gapless mode, so a0 = 0. The strategy of the reconstruction of \u03c9i\u22651 then works as follows. The series representation of \u03c90 in (2.6) converges in a holomorphic disk of which the radius R is determined by the lowest critical point z1 where level-crossing occurs. That is, R = |z1|. By utilising the theorem of Darboux, which will be discussed in detail in section 3, one can then use the coefficients an to compute the location of the critical point z1 (a branch point), its order p, and moreover, find the full Puiseux series expansion of \u03c90(z) around z1. Hereon, we will assume that we are dealing with critical points of order p = 2 and that the Puiseux series exponent corresponding to the reconstructed series is mj = p (cf. eq. (2.5)). Note that similar statements can also be made for p > 2 with mj = p. The Darboux theorem then allows us to find all coefficients bn of the following Puiseux series:\n\u03c90(z) = \u2212i \u221e\u2211 n=0 e i\u03c0n 2 bn(z \u2212 z1)n/2. (2.7)\nSince z1 is the point where \u03c90 collides with another mode, say \u03c91 (i.e., \u03c90(z1) = \u03c91(z1)), one can now use the Puiseux theorem in eq. (2.5) to determine the series expansion of the next mode \u03c91(z) around z1 directly from (2.7). It is given by (for details, see refs. [24] and [44])\n\u03c91(z) = \u2212i \u221e\u2211 n=0 e\u2212 i\u03c0n 2 bn(z \u2212 z1)n/2. (2.8)\nThe disk of convergence of the series \u03c91(z) in (2.8) is centred at z1 and has the same radius as that of the series (2.7). The next steps in the reconstruction of other modes are clear but somewhat difficult to state in a concise manner as they require a \u2018detective\u2019-like approach to exploring the Riemann surfaces of \u03c90 and \u03c91. In particular, the investigation requires re-expansions and analytic continuations4 of \u03c90 and \u03c91 combined with further uses of the Darboux theorem at critical points to recover \u03c9i\u22652(z). Here, we state some options for how this can work. What we are required to do is to find a representation of \u03c90 or \u03c91 that extends at least to the vicinity of the next nearest level-crossing critical point z2 where either \u03c90 or \u03c91 collides with \u03c92. The simplest scenario is that the radius of convergence of (2.8) is limited by z2, in which case one can immediately, as above, use the Darboux theorem to find the Puiseux series representation of \u03c92(z) around z = z2. Another scenario is that a different critical point is limiting the convergence of (2.8). In the holographic example studied in section 4.2, this will be z\u22171 (the complex conjugate of z1). One then has two options. The first is to perform analytic continuations of \u03c90(z) in (2.6) or of \u03c91(z) in (2.8) outside their respective radii of convergence to find z2 and reconstruct \u03c92 by the Darboux theorem from an appropriate series. Another option, which we develop here, is to use a different ansatz for the Darboux theorem with multiple critical points and directly reconstruct \u03c92(z) around z2 from (2.8). The success of this step depends on whether z2 is \u2018sufficiently close\u2019 to the critical point obstructing (2.8) for the expansions to converge and whether or not there may be even more critical points in the vicinity. We address all those options in section 3.\n4Note that, in principle, any of the numerous known methods of analytic continuation can be chosen.\n\u2013 6 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 1\nThen, with the knowledge of \u03c90, \u03c91 and \u03c92, one proceeds with analogous steps to recursively seek out the remainder of the spectrum. Such successive explorations of the complex z Riemann surfaces of each dispersion relation are expected to eventually recover all dispersion relations \u03c9i(z) of the modes that are in any way connected via level-crossings to other, already known, modes. While this general statement is \u2018easy to state\u2019, in practice, doing this is a difficult task. In particular, the success depends on the detailed knowledge (e.g., the many coefficients an) of the behaviour of one of the modes. Moreover, a successful reconstruction also depends on the intricacies of conformal mappings and analytic continuations, which demand a certain level of creativity. Nevertheless, we claim that this procedure is in principle possible, which has important physical implications. In particular, it means that multiple modes \u2014 even all modes in some spectra \u2014 are intimately related and that each one of them has the complete knowledge of the \u2018physics\u2019 of all other modes connected to it via level-crossings. This complete knowledge can extend from the deep infra-red to the extreme ultra-violet energies in the spectrum. Finally, it is important to note that, here, we are not claiming a general theorem of complete reconstructability of any QFT correlation function spectrum. This is because the space of functions, theories and examples one can study is infinitely large, and several things could feasibly obstruct the success of such a reconstruction. For example, one could encounter a case when some series would be a lacunary series (an analytic function that cannot be analytically continued), or other issues. Rather, beyond the goal of ours to argue that a complete reconstruction of operator spectra is possible in some examples of highly non-trivial theories of interest (such as in the N = 4 SYM theory or a lower-dimension theory of M2 branes), another concrete goal is to show how, in practice, this can be constructively done with a controlled method when only a finite number of coefficients an is known, for example, from a numerical calculation. We explain the relevant known and new details of the Darboux theorem in the next section and apply them to two examples in section 4. The main (holographic) example of momentum diffusion in a thermal 3d CFT is studied in section 4.2."

            "text": "In this section, we develop the relevant details of the Darboux theorem that is central to the proposed method of spectral reconstruction in this paper (see e.g. ref. [45], Theorem 11.10b). Let us consider a function f(z) that is holomorphic inside a convergent disk |z| < R, which we denote by DR. The boundary of the closed disk D\u0304R (i.e., |z| \u2264 R) will be denoted by \u2202DR. In terms of the modes discussed in section 2, f(z) is the original known dispersion relation in the spectrum, i.e. f(z) = \u03c90(z). The radius of convergence of the series representation is determined by the critical point of the associated spectral curve z1 where the first level-crossing occurs. This means that R = |z1|. The function can in fact have several critical (branch) points located at |z| = |z1| (i.e., at \u2202D|z1|) or in the vicinity of \u2202D|z1|. For this reason, we will structure our discussion into five distinct and relevant cases. First, in section 3.1, we will show how the reconstruction algorithm works in the simplest case when there is only a single critical point located\n\u2013 7 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 1\n(a) One critical point at \u2202D|z1|.\n(b) Two complex conjugated critical points\nat \u2202D|z1|.\n(c) Two general critical points at \u2202D|z1|.\n(d) One critical point at \u2202D|z1| and another in its\nvicinity.\n(e) J critical points at or near \u2202D|z1|.\nFigure 1. Different configurations of critical (branch) points limiting convergence.\nat \u2202D|z1|. For successful and fast convergence of the procedure, we will assume that there are no other critical points in the vicinity of \u2202D|z1|. Of course, additional critical points outside D\u0304|z1| are only relevant when it comes to a practical evaluation of the algorithm, not for making formal mathematical statements. Then, in sections 3.2, and 3.3, we will consider cases when two critical points z1 and z2 lie precisely at \u2202D|z1|. In section 3.2, which is an important case for many physical scenarios, for example, in the holographic calculation in section 4.2, we will restrict the two points to being each other\u2019s complex conjugates, z2 = z\u22171 . In section 3.4, we will then use the tools from the cases with two critical points, but apply them to a case with a single critical point at \u2202D|z1| and another critical point in the vicinity of \u2202D|z1|. This development will significantly improve the practical applicability of our algorithm and this case will also be explicitly used for a part of the calculation in section 4.2. Finally, in section 3.5, we will consider cases with more than two critical points. The five described scenarios, each requiring a different ansatz in deriving the Darboux theorem, are summarised in figure 1. In order to develop the reconstruction algorithm in each of the cases, we will assume that we know the coefficients an of the convergent power series representation of f(z) in D|z1| around the origin:\nf(z) = \u221e\u2211 n=0 anz n. (3.1)\nThe nature of the critical point(s), as well as the expansion of f(z) around z1 can then be worked out from the theorem of Darboux, which relates the asymptotic behaviour of\n\u2013 8 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 1\nthe function f(z) near the critical point z1 to the large-n behaviour of the coefficients an. However, since, in practice, one rarely knows all coefficients an, we will also show how the theorem can be implemented given a finite sequence of an, known analytically or numerically. This procedure will be based on the work of Hunter and Guerrieri [46]. Even though the formulae below will be general, as motivated by physical examples, we will mainly think of these critical points as being of order p = mj = 2. In terms of level-crossing, such critical points correspond to \u2018collisions\u2019 of a pair of modes in the spectrum [24]. Note that, hereon, we will no longer make references to mj in eq. (2.5). It is, however, important to bear in mind that only the Puiseux series that have the property of mj > 1 can be used in the reconstruction algorithm."

            "heading": "3.1 One critical point (Case 1a)",
            "text": "We start with the case of f(z) having a single critical point z = z1 on the circle z = Rei\u03b8, where \u03b8 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0]. Without loss of generality, we can take z1 \u2208 R. In an expansion around z1, the function f(z) has the asymptotic form\nf(z) \u223c (z \u2212 z1)\u2212\u03bd r(z) + . . . , (3.2)\nwhere r(z) is regular in |z| < \u03c1 for some real, positive \u03c1 > |z1|, which therefore allows a convergent expansion with a finite radius of convergence around z1:\nr(z) = \u221e\u2211 m=0 rm (z \u2212 z1)m . (3.3)\nIn terms of the order of the critical point (cf. eq. (2.3)),\n\u03bd = \u22121/p. (3.4)\nThe ellipsis in (3.2) denotes terms that give a subleading contribution to the singularity. For example, for a p = 2 critical point, which will be of greatest relevance below, we can express all those terms with a single other function q(z), which is also regular at z = z1 and permits an analogous Taylor expansion to r(z):\nq(z) = \u221e\u2211 m=0 qm (z \u2212 z1)m . (3.5)\nFor p = 3, for example, we would parametrise the subleading (ellipsis) terms with two functions: (z \u2212 z1)2/3q1(z) and q2(z). Again, with both q1(z) and q2(z) regular at z = z1. Let us for the moment keep \u03bd general. The theorem of Darboux then immediately enables the reconstruction of the leading singular terms in f(z) through the representation of eq. (3.2). This is done by using the relation between the asymptotic form of the coefficients an for n\u2192\u221e and the coefficients rm. In particular, for n\u2192\u221e,\nan \u223c \u221e\u2211 k=0 (\u22121)k\u2212\u03bd(\u03bd \u2212 k)nrk n!zn\u2212k+\u03bd1 , (3.6)\n\u2013 9 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 1\nwhere (k)n denotes the Pochhammer symbol. For a setup with a single critical point at \u2202D|z1|, eq. (3.6) is the statement (the result) of Darboux\u2019s theorem. The asymptotic form of an then allows us to express the exponent \u03bd in terms of the location the critical point z1:\n\u03bd = lim n\u2192\u221e\n[ z1(n+ 1)\nan+1 an \u2212 n\n] (3.7)\nand also gives an iterative expression for all rm in terms of r0\u2264k<m and an\u2192\u221e. Namely,\nrm = lim n\u2192\u221e\n[ (\u22121)m\u2212\u03bdn!zn\u2212m+\u03bd1 an\n(\u03bd \u2212m)n \u2212 m\u22121\u2211 k=0 (\u22121)m\u2212k(\u03bd \u2212 k)nrk (\u03bd \u2212m)nzm\u2212k1\n] . (3.8)\nThis means that the knowledge of \u03bd allows to solve for the critical point location z1 by using the limiting expression in eq. (3.7) and an\u2192\u221e. Then, we can iteratively use eq. (3.8) to compute all rm from the knowledge of \u03bd, z1 and all an. This constructs the series representation of r(z) in eq. (3.2). It may seem from the above expressions that, in practice, we must know either z1 or \u03bd in advance in order to be able to proceed and find all rm. However, as we will show below in section 3.1.1, this is not necessary. It is sufficient to know only the sequence of coefficients an and to avoid the above complication by using the procedure outlined in ref. [46]. With the complete knowledge of \u03bd, z1 and r(z), we are still left with the task of finding the subleading terms in eq. (3.2). For concreteness, let us now fix \u03bd = \u22121/2 so that the only remaining function that needs to be found is q(z). The asymptotic form of the original f(z) from eq. (3.2) is then\nf(z) \u223c (z \u2212 z1)\u2212\u03bd r(z) + q(z) (3.9)\nand the simplest way to find q(z) is by defining a new function g(z) for which q(z) \u2018controls\u2019 the square root branch point. One can then use the Darboux theorem for the second time and find the coefficients qm (cf. eq. (3.5)). Explicitly, we define\ng(z) \u2261 (z \u2212 z1)\u03bd f(z) \u223c r(z) + (z \u2212 z1)\u03bd q(z), (3.10)\nso that g(z) has the following a series expansion around z = 0:\ng(z) = \u221e\u2211 n=0 gnz n, (3.11)\nwhere each coefficient gn can be found directly from an:\ngn = n\u2211 k=0 (\u22121)n\u2212k\u2212\u03bd(\u03bd)n\u2212kak (n\u2212 k)!zn\u2212k\u2212\u03bd1 . (3.12)\nClearly, the radius of convergence of the series representation (3.11) is the same as that of f(z) in eq. (3.1). Next, we can simply use an analogous iterative procedure as for rm. The only difference is that, now, the exponent of (z \u2212 z1) has a different sign. We find\nqm = lim n\u2192\u221e [ n\u2211 k=0 (\u22121)n+m\u2212kn!(\u03bd)n\u2212kak (\u2212\u03bd \u2212m)n(n\u2212 k)!zm\u2212k1 \u2212 m\u22121\u2211 k=0 (\u22121)k\u2212m(\u2212\u03bd \u2212 k)nqk (\u2212\u03bd \u2212m)nzm\u2212k1 ] . (3.13)\n\u2013 10 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 1\nIn this case, the analogue of the relation (3.7) can be used as a consistency check as one can easily show that\nlim n\u2192\u221e\n[ z1(n+ 1)\ngn+1 gn \u2212 n\n] = \u2212 lim\nn\u2192\u221e\n[ z1(n+ 1)\nan+1 an \u2212 n\n] = \u2212\u03bd = 1/2. (3.14)\nWe have thereby reconstructed the full Puiseux series representation of f(z) around the critical point z = z1 of order p = 2:\nf(z) = \u2212i \u221e\u2211 n=0 e i\u03c0n 2 bn (z \u2212 z1)n/2 , (3.15)\nwhere in terms of rn and qm,\nb2n = iqne\u2212in\u03c0, b2n+1 = rne\u2212i(n+ 1 2 )\u03c0, (3.16)\nfor n \u2265 0. The expression (3.15) is an analytic continuation of the original series representation of f(z) (cf. eq. (3.1)) that was expanded around z = 0. The solution in eq. (3.15) has the correct structure of a branch of Puiseux series solutions expanded around an order p = \u22121/\u03bd = 2 critical point. Hence, we can define f+(z) \u2261 f(z). The second branch then follows from the general structure of Puiseux series (see refs. [24] and [44]). In particular, the two solutions written together are (cf. eq. (2.8), which follows from eq. (2.5))\nf\u00b1(z) = \u2212i \u221e\u2211 n=0 e\u00b1 i\u03c0n 2 bn (z \u2212 z1)n/2 . (3.17)\nIn terms of the modes discussed in section 2, f\u2212(z) = \u03c91(z) is the second solution. Finally, we note that a similar procedure of redefining the original function f(z) can also be performed in order to isolate different regular functions for p \u2265 3. For example, for p = 3, these were called q1(z) and q2(z)."

            "text": "Next, we ask the question of how the above procedure can be executed in practice when only a finite number of the series coefficients an is known; e.g., for some 0 \u2264 n \u2264 N . As mentioned above, this can be done following the procedure proposed by Hunter and Guerrieri in ref. [46]. In particular, we define the following recurrence relation constructed purely in terms of the known coefficients an:\nX0n(\u03bd, z1) = an,\nXm+1n (\u03bd, z1) = Xmn (\u03bd, z1)\u2212 (n+ \u03bd \u2212 2m\u2212 1)\nnz1 Xmn\u22121(\u03bd, z1), for m \u2265 0.\n(3.18)\nCrucially, the asymptotic expansion of Xmn is given by\nXmn (\u03bd, z1) \u223c \u221e\u2211 k=m (\u22121)k+m\u2212\u03bdk!(\u03bd \u2212 k)n\u2212mrk n!(k \u2212m)!zn+\u03bd\u2212k1 \u223c O(n\u03bd\u22122m\u22121). (3.19)\nHence, in the limit of large n and large m, the right-hand-side of (3.19) tends to zero. Choosing two different Xmn and setting them to zero (up to errors, which tend to zero as\n\u2013 11 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 1\nn,m\u2192\u221e), we can then solve a simultaneous system of two equations for two unknowns: \u03bd and z1. It is most practical to first set\nX1N = 0, X1N\u22121 = 0, (3.20)\nso that the system of equations is linear and \u03bd and z1 unique. Then, we can use these solutions as seeds to numerically iteratively solve for\nXmN = 0, XmN\u22121 = 0, (3.21)\nwith increasing m \u2264M , for some M . At each step, we look for solutions close to \u03bd and z1. Due to the rapid convergence of this procedure, we can easily check whether the iteratively generated solutions are correct. Thereby, as noted above, we indeed recover both \u03bd and z1 purely from the knowledge of an. Next, we extend the discussion of [46] to also find the coefficients rm of the series (3.3). In particular, we define a different recurrence relation\nY 0`,n(\u03bd, z1) = an,\nY m+1`,n (\u03bd, z1) = Y m `,n(\u03bd, z1)\u2212 (n+ \u03bd \u2212 2m\u2212 `\u2212 2) nz1 Y m`,n\u22121(\u03bd, z1), for m \u2265 0. (3.22)\nIt is easy to check that this recurrence naturally gives r0 when we choose ` = 0. Then, iteratively, recurrences with higher ` lead to the coefficients r`. To see this, first take ` = 0. It can then be shown that the leading term in the asymptotic expansion of Y m`=0,n is\nY m0,n(\u03bd, z1) \u223c (\u22121)\u2212\u03bdm!(\u03bd)n\u2212mr0\nn!zn+\u03bd1 +O(n\u03bd\u22122m\u22122). (3.23)\nHence, in the limit of large n and large m, the expression (3.23) indeed allows us to accurately compute r0 from the known \u03bd and z1. For general `,\nY m`,n \u223c \u2211\u0300 k=0 (\u22121)k\u2212\u03bd(m+ `\u2212 k)!(\u03bd \u2212 k)n\u2212mrk n!(`\u2212 k)!zn+\u03bd\u2212k1 +O(n\u03bd\u22122m\u2212`\u22122), (3.24)\nfrom where the expression for r` given in terms of the coefficients r0\u2264k<` follows:\nr` = lim n\u2192\u221e [ (\u22121)`\u2212\u03bdn!zn+\u03bd\u2212`1 m!(\u03bd \u2212 `)n\u2212m Y m`,n \u2212 `\u22121\u2211 k=0 ( m+ `\u2212 k m ) (\u22121)`\u2212k(\u03bd \u2212 k)n\u2212mrk (\u03bd \u2212 `)n\u2212mz`\u2212k1 ] .

Due to its simplicity, we will be able to analyse this case analytically. The complex spectral curve that we consider here is\nP (\u03c9, z) = \u03c92 + \u03c9 \u2212 z = 0. (3.26)\n\u2013 12 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 1\nThe equation has two solutions representing the two branches of the Riemann surface:\n\u03c9\u00b1(z) = \u2212 1 2 \u00b1 \u221a z \u2212 z1, (3.27)\nwith z1 = \u22121/4 being the only critical point. Note that this can be shown by using eq. (2.3). Of the two solutions, in the language of physical modes, \u03c9+(z) is the gapless \u2018hydrodynamic\u2019 mode: \u03c9+(0) = 0. The second mode is gapped: \u03c9\u2212(0) = \u22121. To demonstrate the proposed reconstruction procedure, we imagine that we are only given the coefficients an of the Taylor series expansion of f(z) = \u03c9+(z) around the point z = 0:\nf(z) = \u221e\u2211 n=1 anz n. (3.28)\nExplicitly, the coefficients are\nan = 22n\u22121 (\n1/2 n\n) . (3.29)\nOne can easily check that the radius of convergence of the series (3.28) is indeed 1/4. Our first task is now to find the location of the critical point z1 and the exponent \u03bd of the asymptotic form of f(z) \u223c (z \u2212 z1)\u2212\u03bdr(z). Since \u03bd will turn out to be equal to \u22121/2, we will then be able to compute the Puiseux series coefficients bn of the expansion\nf(z) \u2261 f+(z) = \u2212i \u221e\u2211 n=0 e i\u03c0n 2 bn (z \u2212 z1)n/2 (3.30)\naround z1, and, finally, use them to determine the series expansion of the second branch, which will correspond to \u03c9\u2212(z) (cf. eq. (3.17)):\nf\u2212(z) = \u2212i \u221e\u2211 n=0 e\u2212 i\u03c0n 2 bn (z \u2212 z1)n/2 . (3.31)\nWe start by constructing the polynomials Xmn , which are defined in eq. (3.18). For m = 1, we get\nX1n = \u2212 22n\u22123\nnz1 [(4z1 + 1)n\u2212 6z1 + \u03bd \u2212 1] ( 1/2 n\u2212 1 ) . (3.32)\nSolving the system of equations X1n = 0 and X1n\u22121 = 0 for \u03bd and z1, one immediately obtains the correct result:\nz1 = \u2212 1 4 and \u03bd = \u2212 1 2 . (3.33)\nIn this case, there is no need to use higher m. The result is exact and analytical. In more complicated examples considerer below, however, we will see that the accuracy of numerical calculations benefits enormously from a recursive calculation at higher and higher m. Next, we determine the coefficients bn, which is done in two steps. First, we compute the odd-n and then, the even-n coefficients (cf. eq. (3.16)). By using eq. (3.22) to construct the polynomials Y m`,n and setting m = 1 and ` = 0, we find\nY 10,n = \u2212 4n\u22121\n\u221a \u03c0\n\u0393(n+ 1)\u0393(5/2\u2212 n) . (3.34)\n\u2013 13 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 1\nUsing eq. (3.25) for the coefficients r`, it follows that\nr0 = lim n\u2192\u221e [ (\u22121)\u2212\u03bdn!zn+\u03bd1 m!(\u03bd)n\u2212m Y 10,n ] = 1, (3.35)\nwhile all other r` vanish. This fixes all coefficients bn with odd n. Next, we determine the coefficients bn with even n by utilising the auxiliary function g(z), as defined in eq. (3.10). The coefficients of its series expansion around z = 0 are given by (3.12). In this case, we find that\ngn = \u22124n ( \u221212 n ) . (3.36)\nOne can check that the branch point of g(z) is at the same location as the branch point of the original function \u03c9+(z), i.e., at z = z1 = \u22121/4, while the relevant \u2018asymptotic scaling\u2019 exponent is now \u2212\u03bd = 1/2 instead of \u03bd = \u22121/2. We then construct the polynomials Y 10,n,\nY 10,n = 4n \u221a \u03c0\n\u0393(n+ 1)\u0393(3/2\u2212 n) , (3.37)\nand find that q0 = lim\nn\u2192\u221e [ (\u22121)+\u03bdn!zn\u2212\u03bd1 m!(\u2212\u03bd)n\u2212m Y 10,n ] = \u221212 , (3.38)\nwhile all other q` vanish. This fixes all coefficients bn with even n. By using eqs. (3.3) and (3.5) (along with eq. (3.16)) in (3.9), we obtain the correct series expansion of f = \u03c9+ around z1:\nf(z) \u2261 f+(z) = \u03c9+(z) = (z \u2212 z1)\u2212\u03bd \u221e\u2211 m=0 rm (z \u2212 z1)m + \u221e\u2211 m=0 qm (z \u2212 z1)m\n= \u221212 + \u221a z + 14 . (3.39)\nFinally, this result immediately gives us the Puiseux series expansion of the second solution f\u2212(z) = \u03c9\u2212(z) around z = z1 (cf. eq. (3.17)):\nf\u2212(z) = \u03c9\u2212(z) = \u2212 1 2 \u2212 \u221a z + 14 . (3.40)\nNote that the Puiseux series expansions of f\u00b1 around the critical point z1 are finite series. Hence, they both have an infinite radius of convergence unlike the Taylor series representation of f+ around z = 0. The reason is that the Puiseux series representations in eqs. (3.39) and (3.40) happen to be the exact solutions (3.27) of the spectral curve equation. The two solutions represent the entire Riemann surface associated with the spectral curve."

In all cases with two critical points, in addition to the fact the function f(z) has the asymptotic form\nf(z) \u223c (z \u2212 z1)\u2212\u03bd r(z) + q(z) (3.41)\nas z \u2192 z1, we also have that\nf(z) \u223c (z \u2212 z2)\u2212\u03bd p(z) + s(z) (3.42)\nas z \u2192 z2. Here, r(z), q(z), p(z) and s(z) are again all regular in |z| < \u03c1 for some \u03c1 > |z1|. Asymptotic behaviour of the coefficients an of the expansion of f(z) around the origin is now given by the sum of two series of the form (3.6) for the two critical points:\nan \u223c \u221e\u2211 k=0 (\u22121)k\u2212\u03bd(\u03bd \u2212 k)n n!Rn\u2212k+\u03bd ( rke \u2212i(n\u2212k+\u03bd)\u03b8 + pkei(n\u2212k+\u03bd)\u03b8 ) , (3.43)\nwhere we designate the coefficients of the expansion of r(z) and p(z) around z1 and z2, respectively, as rk and pk, while we write the two critical points as z1 = z\u22172 = Rei\u03b8. Here, we also note that another way to perform this analysis is through a more \u2018symmetric\u2019 representation of the function f(z) given by\nf(z) = (z \u2212 z1)\u2212\u03bd (z \u2212 z2)\u2212\u03bd R(z) +Q(z), (3.44)\nwhere we can then make use of the Taylor multi-point expansion of R(z):\nR(z) = \u221e\u2211 k=0 (\u03b1k + z\u03b2k)(z \u2212 z1)k(z \u2212 z2)k. (3.45)\nIn some cases, this (formally equivalent) ansatz may be more useful than the one discussed above, but since this had not proved to be so in our numerical calculations, we delegate the details of its presentation to appendix B."

(3.48)\nWe then iterate the procedure in increasing m \u2264M , for some M , at each step solving the three equations\nXmN = 0, XmN\u22121 = 0, XmN\u22122 = 0, (3.49)\nand taking the previous solution in m as the seed for the next one.

In practice, Fmn,k is easy to compute and we evaluate it in the process of the calculation. For conciseness, we will not state its explicit form at any of the steps here. To obtain the `-th coefficients r` and p` in terms of r0\u2264k<` and p0\u2264k<`, we then consider the linear system of equations\nYM`,N \u2212 \u2211\u0300 k=0 FMN,k = 0, YM`,N\u22121 \u2212 \u2211\u0300 k=0 FMN\u22121,k = 0, (3.52)\nwhere the error scales as O(N\u03bd\u22123M\u2212`\u22122) at large N , and solve the system of equations for the two unknowns r` and p`. Again, in order to determine the coefficients of the function q(z) from (3.41), we, as in the case of a single critical point, define an auxiliary function g(z) by\ng(z) \u2261 (z \u2212 z1)\u03bd f(z) \u223c r(z) + (z \u2212 z1)\u03bdq(z), (3.53)\nand use the above algorithm (3.52) on the coefficients gn, which are again given by\ngn = n\u2211 k=0 (\u22121)n\u2212k\u2212\u03bd(\u03bd)n\u2212kak (n\u2212 k)!zn\u2212k\u2212\u03bd1 .

In the language of QFT modes, f0(z) is a \u2018gapless\u2019 mode with f0(0) = 0, so a0 = 0. For this reason, a Taylor series representation around the origin mimics a result one would obtain from an EFT written in terms of a gradient expansion. How does one proceed to reconstruct the spectrum? By using one of the standard convergence tests, the simplest thing one can do is to check that the series (4.3) has a finite radius of convergence, which is given by |z1|. A priori, however, it is not clear how many critical points are obstructing its convergence at \u2202D|z1|. Assuming convergence along (most of) \u2202D|z1|, a concrete thing one can try is to investigate the behaviour of the series f1 at the boundary by plotting its value or the value of its derivative. In many cases, this can serve as an excellent estimate for the number of branch points causing the divergence and, in turn, as a tool to pick the \u2018correct\u2019 ansatz from the ones described in section 3.

We start by using the first part of the algorithm, which allows us to determine the location of the branch point. Namely, we construct the polynomials Xm\u2264Mn\u2264N0 defined by the following recurrence relation from the coefficients an\u2264N0 (cf. eq. (3.18)):\nX0n(\u03bd, z1) = an,\nXm+1n (\u03bd, z1) = Xmn (\u03bd, z1)\u2212 (n+ \u03bd \u2212 2m\u2212 1)\nnz1 Xmn\u22121(\u03bd, z1), for m \u2265 0.\n(4.4)\nBy setting XmN0 = 0 and X m N0\u22121 = 0, for each m \u2264 M (cf. eq. (3.21)), and calculating the location and the order of the branch point, we obtain an approximation zcalc1 of the critical point z1. To show how well this procedure works for different M and N0, we compare zcalc1 with the exact z1 from eq. (4.2) in figure 3. We see that for a fixed N0, the precision slowly saturates with increasing M . If we desire results with higher precision, this cannot be achieved by simply increasing M . As expected, we have to increase the number of known coefficients N0 as well. Having determined the branch point position to some desired precision, we then use the second part of the algorithm, which allows us to calculate all coefficients of the Puiseux expansion of f0 and then f1 around the branch point.

The remaining half, the even coefficients b2n, follow from an analogous calculation for the auxiliary function g(z), giving the coefficients qn from eq. (3.13). It is important to note that for the precision of the second step of the algorithm (determining bn), both the number N0 of the starting coefficients an and the precision with which we determine zcalc1 are essential. We demonstrate this by showing the error in the first calculated odd coefficient b1 = \u2212ir0 (cf. eq. (3.16)) versus the error in the calculated branch point zcalc1 for three values of N0 andM used to calculate b1. The results are shown in figure 4. For each N0 and M that we use to calculate the coefficient b1, there exists a limiting precision of the branch point position above which |bcalc1 \u2212b1| no longer depends on |zcalc1 \u2212 z1|. Furthermore, the value of the limiting precision grows with increasing N0 and M . Thus, when performing the calculations, it is best to try to keep the error in zcalc1 below this particular limiting value so that the error in the subsequently calculated coefficients remains independent of it. Let us now also take a look at higher coefficients. In table 1, we show the first 5 odd coefficients rn = b2n+1ei(n+ 1 2 )\u03c0 obtained by using different methods. The first column of results presents the \u2018actual\u2019 (analytically obtained) values of rn that can be computed directly from the spectral curve (SC). In the second column, we show the coefficients calculated with the algorithm in eq. (3.25), using the (exact) analytic value of z1. In the process, we use N0 = 2000 starting coefficients and preform the recursion M = 5 times.\n\u2013 22 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 1\nFor the results in the third column, we instead use the calculated (reconstructed) value of the branch point zcalc1 , again using the algorithm in eq. (3.21) with the same N0 = 2000 and, now, M = 20. By comparing the first three columns, we notice a rapid drop of precision of the calculated values of higher-order coefficients when z1 is not determined precisely enough, i.e., when we use zcalc1 . In particular, we see that r1 is determined to 5 significant figures (as already determined from the two plots above), r2 is precise only up to the first significant figure while r3 is already dramatically wrong. We therefore conclude that with a fixed number of starting coefficients N0, the error in the calculated position of z1 indeed rapidly permeates the precision of calculated rn. Fortunately, in calculating rn, this shortcoming can be somewhat remedied by employing an optimisation procedure to improve zcalc1 . We will call the z1 calculated in this way the \u2018optimised\u2019 branch point zopt1 . The general idea behind the procedure is as follows. Since |z1| > 1, we know that the sequence of the coefficients rn we are trying to calculate is convergent, therefore, Cauchy. Hence, if the calculated coefficients start diverging, as they do in the third column of table 1, then we can attempt to correct the value of z1 that we are using. Imagine now that we are calculating the first n coefficients of the expansion. One thing we can do is define a quantity Fn that measures the \u2018Cauchyness\u2019 of the calculated coefficients, i.e.,\nFn(rn\u22122, rn\u22121, rn; z1) = |rn\u22122 \u2212 rn\u22121||rn\u22121 \u2212 rn|\u2223\u2223\u2223|rn\u22122 \u2212 rn\u22121| \u2212 |rn\u22121 \u2212 rn|\u2223\u2223\u2223 , (4.7)\nwhere we chose for Fn to depend on the last three of the calculated coefficients. Since the coefficients rn are calculated using a certain value of the branch point position, they implicitly all depend on the same z1 that we used for their calculation. One can now simply minimise the value of Fn while varying the value of the branch point position:\nmin zopt1 \u2208C\nFn(rn\u22122, rn\u22121, rn; zopt1 ). (4.8)\nFor the starting value of z1, it is convenient to use the value of zcalc1 calculated using eq. (3.21). Finding the value of zopt1 where the minimum is attained therefore allows us to determine the branch point position to precision much greater than that of zcalc1 . This is something that is not possible with the use of the algorithm (3.21) alone. Nevertheless, by using the proposed optimisation (or a similar procedure), we do not need any additional information about the solution f0, only the initial N0 coefficients. The results of such a computation for the first 5 odd coefficients, where we use eq. (4.8) with n = 5, are included in the last column of table 1. We note that by doing this, we nearly doubled the precision of the calculated branch point and managed to reconstruct 3 instead of 1 coefficient with the precision of 5 significant figures or more. Since we want this to serve as a proof of principle, we will not explore such optimisations any further and we will hereon for simplicity use the analytically computed value of the branch point z1 to demonstrate the rest of the calculation. Another reason to continue with z1 is that the success in calculating zcalc1 and its importance for the calculation of coefficients appear to be rather case-specific. As we will see in the holographic example\n\u2013 23 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 1\nn rn (from SC) rcalcn (with z1) rcalcn (with zcalc1 ) rcalcn (with z opt 1 )\n1 0.6147881530 0.6147881530 0.6147866244 0.6147881530 2 \u22120.0207471500 \u22120.0207471500 \u22120.0127043545 \u22120.0207471466 3 0.0032346953 0.0032346953 \u221213.532036923 0.0032288977 4 \u22120.0006892719 \u22120.0006892719 9147.5180459 0.0032288977 5 0.0001694157 0.0001694150 \u22122.5631597\u00d7 106 \u22121.0977124652\nbranch point precision\n/ \u2212\u221e \u22129.882 \u221216.250\nTable 1.

The first column displays the \u2018exact\u2019 values of rn computed directly (analytically) from the spectral curve (SC). The remaining three columns show the \u2018reconstructed\u2019 values of rn (using the algorithm in eq. (3.25)), computed by using the location of the critical point z1 obtained in different ways: exact z1, reconstructed zcalc1 from the Darboux theorem and optimised z opt 1 (cf. eq. (4.8)), respectively. In the last line of the table, we state the error log10 |zcalc1 \u2212 z1| of the branch point used in each respective column.\nin section 4.2, no optimisation of the branch point location will be necessary to obtain \u2018sufficiently good\u2019 results for the purposes of this paper. If we continue with the analytically known value of the branch point z1, it is enough to use a smaller number of initial coefficients. For example, we can take N0 = 200 and calculate the coefficients bn by performing the recursion M = 100 times. We find this to be sufficient to calculate 80 coefficients (40 even and 40 odd as designated in (3.16)) of the Puiseux expansion of f0 around z1. Since the expansions of f0(z) and f1(z) around z1 are related by eq. (3.17), this means that we have obtained the series representation of the second solution f1(z) around z1:\nf1(z) = N1\u22121\u2211 n=0 bn(z \u2212 z1)n/2, (4.9)\nwith N1 = 80. The solution f1 is the second Riemann sheet of f0 at z1. In the language of physical modes, this is the first \u2018gapped mode\u2019 with f1(z = 0) 6= 0. In fact, a concrete and physically motivated question that allows us to check these results is the calculation of the value of the gap f1(z = 0) (see e.g. figure 2). By simply evaluating the series (4.9) at z = 0, we obtain the correct value of f1(0) = 1 to 30 significant figures. We can now further investigate the structure of the full Riemann surface (of the spectrum) by continuing with the same procedure, using the calculated coefficients bn. The next natural step is the re-expansion of f1 around the critical point that obstructs the convergence of the series (4.9). This point is z2 and we now again show how to determine its position and the Puiseux coefficients of the expansion around it using only the coefficients bn just calculated. A small complication in performing the second step of the re-expansion (going from z1 to z2) arises due to the assumption of regularity of r(z) and q(z) in the ansatz (3.2).

The two columns show the analytically obtained values from the spectral curve (SC) and the reconstructed values using the Darboux theorem.\nassumption is no longer true as the starting series (4.9) is now a Puiseux series of order p = 2 that is expanded around a critical point. What we do to re-expand the series around z2 by means of the Darboux theorem is to change the ansatz in eq. (3.2) and treat the odd and the even coefficients of the starting expansion independently. We describe this \u2018critical origin\u2019 algorithm in detail in appendix A.1.5 From the N1 = 80 coefficients of the Puiseux expansion around the point z1, we calculate N2 = 10 coefficients of the Puiseux expansion of f1 around z2. Then, by again using eq. (3.17), we obtain the third solution f2 with the coefficients cn:\nf2(z) = N2\u22121\u2211 n=0 cn(z \u2212 z2)n/2. (4.10)\nThe calculated coefficients cn are compared to their analytical values obtained from the spectral curve (SC) in table 2. We can also calculate the \u2018gap\u2019 f2(0) by summing up the truncated series expansion (4.10) of the N2 terms and evaluating it in z = 0. The value we obtain is f2(0) = 2.9996208363, which is in good agreement with the true value of f2(0) = 3. With the knowledge of the three expansions (4.3), (4.9) and (4.10) around the three points z = 0, z = z1 and z = z2, respectively, we have, in regions, reconstructed all branches of the Riemann surface of solutions of the equation P (f, z) = 0 in (4.1). We show the two critical points and the three disks of convergence of f0, f1 and f2 in figure 5. Importantly, all points that are outside of the respective disks of convergence of each of the three series expansions can then be reached through analytic continuation of the three series (without the need for any additional extensions to other Riemann sheets).6 In conclusion, for the simple toy model of an algebraic cubic complex spectral curve, we were able to \u2018reconstruct\u2019 all branches of the entire Riemann surface just from the\n5An alternative way of dealing with the critical origin of the expansion is to use the \u2018unwinding\u2019 method\n\u2013 25 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 1\n-4 -2 2 -3 -2 -1\n1\n2\nFigure 5.

            "text": "In this section, we turn our attention to the main example studied in this work. This is the 3d large-N CFT that describes the dynamics of a large-N stack of M2 branes of which the energy-momentum sector is holographically dual to gravitational fluctuations in the AdS4-Schwarzschild black brane geometry. In terms of the ingoing Eddington-Finkelstein coordinates (v, r, x, y), the linearised metric perturbations can be Fourier decomposed along the flat 3d spacetime as \u223c e\u2212i\u03c9v+iqxh\u00b5\u03bd(r). Here, we will only study the transverse fluctuations (with respect to the wavevector pointing along the x axis). The gapless hydrodynamic mode in the spectrum is a diffusive mode, which was first studied by Herzog in ref. [26].\nTo analyse the spectrum of transverse momentum fluctuations, we use standard holographic techniques (see ref. [37]). We look for the equation of motion of the gauge-invariant mode Z(r) \u2261 (\u03c9hxy(r)+ qhty(r))/r2, where the radial coordinate runs from the event horizon at r = r0 to the boundary at r \u2192 \u221e. The Hawking temperature is T = 3r0/4\u03c0. Instead of using r, we will work with a radial coordinate u, defined as u = (r0/r)3/2, with the horizon now located at u = 1 and the boundary at u = 0. The equation of motion for\ndiscussed in the appendix A.2. 6Concretely, one can use for example a M\u00f6bius transformation in order to transform the disk of convergence into a half-plane of convergence or one of many other methods of analytic continuation.\n\u2013 26 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 1\nZ(u) is then given by\n\u22022uZ(u) + w2(1 + u2 \u2212 2iu2/3w)\u2212 z(u2 \u2212 1)(u2 + 2iu2/3w\u2212 1)\nu(u2 \u2212 1)(w2 + (u2 \u2212 1)z) \u2202uZ(u)\n+3z 2u2/3(u2 \u2212 1) + 2iwz(5u2 \u2212 2) + 3zu2/3w2 + 4iw3\n3u4/3(u2 \u2212 1)(w2 + (u2 \u2212 1)z) Z(u) = 0,\n(4.11)\nwhere we have defined the following dimensionless quantities: w \u2261 \u03c9/(2\u03c0T ) and z \u2261 q2, where q \u2261 q/(2\u03c0T ). The quasinormal mode spectrum of Z(u) (with Z(u) regular at u = 1) evaluated at the AdS boundary u = 0 gives the spectrum of the dual retarded correlator [47]. In the language of refs. [23, 24], Z(u) evaluated at u = 0 is (proportional to) the complex spectral curve Z(u = 0) = P (w, z). To find P (w, z), we solve the equation (4.11) for Z(u) in a Frobenius expansion around the horizon in powers of (1 \u2212 u) to order 30. This numerical procedure turns the problem into an analysis of an algebraic spectral curve of which the spectrum, we assume, converges to the \u2018actual\u2019 full quasinormal spectrum as the order of the curve is increased.\nWe now analyse the spectral curve P (w, z) in some detail. By solving the equation P (w, z) = 0 numerically, we first show the spectrum for 4 different \u2018small\u2019 choices of |z| (before any level-crossing occurs) in figure 6 (see refs. [23, 24] for a detailed discussion of how such results are obtained). Besides the hydrodynamic diffusive mode w0(z) (plotted in purple in figure 6), we will mainly focus on the lowest two gapped modes w1(z) (plotted in green) and w2(z) (plotted in orange), which belong to the so-called \u2018Christmas tree\u2019 part of the spectrum.\nTo find the desired series expansion of the hydrodynamic diffusive mode w0(z), we use the equation P (w, z) = 0 and directly calculate the first N0 = 300 coefficients an of the hydrodynamic series\nw0(z) = N0\u2211 n=1 anz n, (4.12)\nwhere all an are imaginary. Note that since w0(z) is gapless (i.e., w0(z = 0) = 0), a0 = 0. Note also that a1 = \u22122\u03c0T iD, where D is the momentum diffusivity that can be expressed in terms of shear viscosity \u03b7, entropy density s and temperature. In this theory, at infinitely strong coupling, D = \u03b7/(sT ) = 1/(4\u03c0T ) [26, 48].\nThe series expansion (4.12) converges inside a disk of radius |z1| set by the (levelcrossing) critical point z1 of the spectral curve P (w, z) = 0 that is closest to the origin. We plot the quasinormal spectrum at the first four level-crossing occurrences in figure 7. The approximate numerical values of the first few critical points (see eq. (2.3)) are:\nz1 = 1.72557 + 0.340429i, w(z1) = 0.925957\u2212 1.524804i, z2 = 2.43776 + 0.511447i, w(z2) = 1.661421\u2212 3.084745i, z3 = 2.99533 + 0.661373i, w(z3) = 2.494940\u2212 4.672911i, z\u22122 = \u22122.52238 + 0.208041i, w(z\u22122) = \u22120.836760\u2212 3.414055i, z\u22121 = \u22121.88524, w(z\u22121) = \u22121.977860,\n(4.13)\n\u2013 27 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 1\n-4 -2 2 4\n-2\n-4\n-4 -2 2 4\n-2\n-4\n-4 -2 2 4\n-2\n-4\n-4 -2 2 4\n-2\n-4\nFigure 6.

We depict the positions of the lowest critical points in figure 8. By comparing the present case to the algebraic curve example studied in subsection 4.1, one immediately notices that there is now a larger number of critical points and that, more importantly, some points are located \u2018very close\u2019 to each other. While this does not prevent a reconstruction, it does make it more difficult as different level-crossing critical points (of their respective wn) present obstructions to certain convenient re-expansions of the series. To show this, besides the critical points, in the figure 8, we also plot three disks of convergence of the expansions w0 (the hydrodynamic diffusive mode) and the first two gapped modes w1 and w2 around z = 0, z1 and z2, respectively. The blue disk is the (original) disk of convergence of the hydrodynamic diffusive Taylor series while the orange and green disks represent the disks of convergence of the Puiseux series of the first two gapped modes around z1 and z2, respectively. The reconstruction using the Darboux theorem will follow the arrows from the origin to the first and the second gapped modes.\nAfter this brief introduction to the features of the holographic spectrum at hand, we proceed with the reconstruction by using the theorems of Darboux and Puiseux. For comparison of our results with a reconstruction that uses the method of Pad\u00e9 approximants, see appendix C. The first step is to re-expand the hydrodynamic series (4.12) around the first critical point z1 where the hydrodynamic mode collides with the gapped mode w1. This step is depicted with the orange arrow in figure 8. As discussed, in general, we do not know how many critical points are obstructing the convergence of the starting series.

In this particular case, we start by applying the root convergence test to the coefficients an to find the approximate radius of convergence. In the left panel of figure 9, we display the logarithms of the coefficients along with a linear fit, which gives Rfit = 1.76937 to 2 significant figures (the \u2018actual\u2019 radius of convergence is R = 1.75883). We then set z = Rfitei\u03c6 and plot w(z) and \u2202zw(z) as functions of \u03c6 \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0] to observe their behaviour at the boundary. In this way, we can get a sense of the number of critical points that are located on or near the boundary of the convergence disk. This is shown in the right panel of figure 9.\nWe observe that, likely, we are dealing with a case of two critical point causing the divergence of \u2202zw(z), and thereby, the divergence of the hydrodynamic series (4.12). Moreover, the two locations (as required by the symmetries of the spectrum) are each other\u2019s complex conjugates, which means that it is sensible to proceed by using the Case 1b of the reconstruction algorithm discussed in section 3. If this choice were for some reason incorrect, we would immediately notice this by the lack of convergence of the algorithm, which could then be remedied by a different ansatz. In the language of the relevant section 3.2, we denote the modulus and the argument of the obstructing branch point z1 by R = |z1| and \u03b8 = Arg[z1]. We now use the Darboux theorem to determine z1 to a much greater precision with the use of the algorithm in eq. (3.49). In particular, we take N0 = 300 initial coefficients and perform the recursionM = 10 times. The errors in the calculated Rcalc and \u03b8calc are shown in the left panel of figure 10. What we see is that by using this procedure, we are able to determine the position of the branch point to approximately 18 significant figures.\nNext, we calculate the Puiseux series expansion of w0(z) around one of the two closest critical points, z1. By using the algorithm in eq. (3.52) with M = 1, we are able to obtain the first N1 = 12 coefficients of the series. The coefficients themselves are shown in table 3, while their errors are plotted in the right panel of figure 10. Although the results are\n\u2013 30 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 1\nsatisfactory, the algorithm in this case does not converge as fast as in the case of a single critical point in section (3.1.1) that was used for the reconstruction of the cubic algebraic curve (4.1) of section 4.1. However, it is also important to note that the success of the calculation of the coefficients has significantly less dependence on the precision with which the branch point location is calculated than in the previous section. Having obtained the Puiseux series expansion of w0(z) around the critical point z = z1, we now also know the series expansion of the second Riemann sheet, the gapped mode w1(z) around z = z1. As before, the two are related by eq. (3.17) and therefore,\nw1(z) = N1\u22121\u2211 n=0 bn(z \u2212 z1)n/2, (4.14)\nwhere, recall, N1 = 12. A clear physically motivated question is again the calculation of the gap w1(z = 0) of the first excited mode w1(z). This is now not completely straightforward because, as can be checked, the series (4.14) has a radius of convergence, which does not extend to z = 0. This can be seen from figure 8, where the disk of convergence is shaded with orange colour. In fact, the critical points z\u22171 , z2 and z\u22172 are all closer to z1 than the origin. This means that we are required to perform an analytic continuation within the same Riemann sheet to evaluate w1(0). While this can be done by any one of numerous methods, we find that a simple use of a Pad\u00e9 approximant around z = z1 provides a rather effective analytic continuation. Using the approximant of order [N1/2, N1/2], we determine the gap wcalc1 (0), which can be compared with the value of w1(0) computed directly from the spectral curve. Their values are:\nwcalc1 (0) = 1.23506\u2212 1.76338i, (4.15) w1(0) = 1.23455\u2212 1.77586i. (4.16)\nThe results agree to approximately two significant figures. Furthermore, with an analytic continuation that can access the dispersion relation of the first gapped mode at z = 0, we could at this point, as in ref. [49], also look for the structure of w1(z) expanded in terms of a gradient expansion in powers of z = q2. Concretely, we could find the coefficients a(1)n of the series w1(z) = w1(0)\u2212 i \u2211\u221e n=1 a (1) n zn.\n\u2013 31 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 1\nn bn (from SC) bn (reconstructed)\n0 0.9259568405\u2212 1.5248039730i 0.9259568405\u2212 1.5248039730i 1 0.5694243295 + 0.8593408725i 0.5694243295 + 0.8593408725i 2 0.2465534194\u2212 0.6564234393i 0.2465534194\u2212 0.6564234391i 3 \u22120.2017505274 + 0.4158971322i \u22120.2017505276 + 0.4158971316i 4 0.2063443343\u2212 0.2276803807i 0.2063443322\u2212 0.2276804330i 5 \u22120.1815319274 + 0.1089739687i \u22120.1815318686 + 0.1089740741i 6 0.1176312182\u2212 0.0460907198i 0.1176321889\u2212 0.0460860162i 7 \u22120.0445357280 + 0.0324548520i \u22120.0445414084 + 0.0324475608i 8 \u22120.0067265055\u2212 0.0593218510i \u22120.0067939136\u2212 0.0594884583i 9 0.0191994441 + 0.1038324422i 0.0194382654 + 0.1040542804i 10 0.0053380839\u2212 0.1353137209i 0.0069628396\u2212 0.1329437874i 11 \u22120.0460909505 + 0.1306640455i \u22120.0507261321 + 0.1276808356i\nTable 3. Comparison between the N1 = 12 coefficients bn form the series expansion of w1(z) calculated directly from the spectral curve (SC) and those reconstructed by using the Darboux theorem.\nTo carry out the next step of the reconstruction (depicted by the green arrow in figure 8) with \u2018reasonable\u2019 precision, we need more than the calculated N1 = 12 coefficients obtained from the first step. In principle, this is not a problem. However, due to computational limitations, and since the purpose of this work is to show the general power of reconstructions and our concrete algorithm at work, we, at that point, choose to recompute the coefficients of the Puiseux series (4.14) directly from the spectral curve P (w, z) = 0. This drastically improves the precision of the second step. We do this by using the NewtonPuiseux (polygon) method, discussed, for example, in ref. [24]. Concretely, we compute N1 = 300 coefficients and continue to perform the second step of the reconstruction by following the same procedure as in step one.\nIn figure 11, we show the results of the convergence test of the series (4.14) and a simple, naive analysis of the location of critical point at the edge of the convergence disk. Importantly, we see only one \u2018actual\u2019 critical point obstructing convergence. However, what we can further infer is that the pattern of \u2202zw1 signals the presence of another critical point near the disk of convergence. One of these (the closest one) is the conjugate point z\u22171 while the second point is a new critical point z2 around which we actually wish to re-expand the series.\nIn cases where, strictly, only one critical point obstructs convergence but there is another point near the boundary of the disk of convergence, the most numerically efficient way to proceed is to use the Case 1d algorithm of the Darboux theorem with two (independent) branch points (using (3.64)), which in our case turn out to be z\u22171 and z2. What is particularly useful about this approach is that, in this way, we can immediately determine\n\u2013 32 \u2013\nH E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 1\nthe coefficients of the expansion around the point z = z2 (using (3.65)), which is located slightly outside the disk of convergence. After performing this calculation, we, as in the first step, obtain N2 = 12 coefficients from of the starting N1 = 300 ones. Again, by using the Puiseux theorem in eq. (3.17), we have thereby also determined the coefficients cn of the expansion of the second gapped mode around z2:\nw2(z) = N2\u22121\u2211 n=0 cn(z \u2212 z2)n/2, (4.17)\nwith N2 = 12. The coefficients are compared to their numerically calculated values from the spectral curve in table 4. We can also calculate the value of the gap w2(0) up to the precision of 1 significant figure by using the Pad\u00e9 approximant to perform the analytic continuation. The values of the calculated gap wcalc2 (0) and the numerically computed gap w2(0) from the spectral curve are:\nwcalc2 (0) = 2.16275\u2212 3.25341i, (4.18) w2(0) = 2.12981\u2212 3.28100i. (4.19)\nFinally, by performing a successive sequence of further analogous steps and by exploring the Riemann surfaces of different modes to locate the level-crossing critical points of the associated spectral curve, we claim that one can obtain the entire spectrum of transverse momentum excitations in this theory."

Comparison between the N2 = 12 coefficients cn form the series expansion of w2(z) calculated directly from the spectral curve (SC) and those reconstructed by using the Darboux theorem.\nthe knowledge of the dispersion relation of one of the physical modes in momentum space. While this is an old problem that has appeared in the literature in many incarnations, we believe that this work can serve as an encouragement or even a general statement that far-reaching reconstructions are possible given certain conditions: most importantly, for all modes that are connected via level-crossings at critical points of the associated correlator\u2019s spectral curve. Without loss of generality in the proposed procedure, we chose to focus on examples that include a gapless mode of which the dynamics can be investigated through the use of an EFT like hydrodynamics. Beyond making general statements, our goal was to develop a systematic algorithm that could be applied when only a limited amount of information about a single mode was known. To facilitate concrete steps in the reconstruction, we developed an algorithm based on the theorems of Darboux and Puiseux, with the occasional need to perform additional analytic continuations of the dispersion relations within the same Riemann sheet, which can be done in any one of numerous ways. This algorithm should be seen as complementary to the more frequently employed method of Pad\u00e9 approximants for convergent series (characterising dispersion relations), used for example in ref. [22]. While it is generally difficult to predict in which situation which method will be more efficient and work \u2018better\u2019, what we claim is that re-expansions of series based on the method of Darboux allow for a more precise and rigorous control of the reconstruction procedure as they do not depend on the choice of the order of the Pad\u00e9 approximant, the inevitable creation of (a multitude or, as the order grows, potentially \u2018infinitely\u2019 many) spurious poles and the need to choose the location of the critical point at the accumulation point of those poles. The re-expansion method is closer to the original spirit of Weier-\n\u2013 34 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 1\nstrass\u2019s analytic continuations. For additional details regarding the comparison between the methods of the Darboux theorem and Pad\u00e9 approximants, particulary, as applied to the holographic example studied in section 4.2, see appendix C. As for the hope that this procedure may be useful for understanding new physics, it is important that the calculation of the (finite) sequence of coefficients an (cf. eq. (2.6)), from which the entire procedure stems, be in some way simpler than the calculation of the full correlator in question. This, in fact, is not difficult to imagine. As discussed in section 2, in hydrodynamics, the coefficients an can be computed from linear response theory and the application of higher-point Kubo formulae in the (somewhat tricky and non-commuting) limits of \u03c9 \u2192 0 and q \u2192 0. Moreover, one may also directly apply the methods of (effective) kinetic theory to obtain such coefficients, thereby potentially further simplifying the calculations. Beyond hydrodynamics, we believe that the same procedures can also be applied to other derivative expanded EFTs, for example to chiral perturbation theory in quantum chromodynamics. Questions such as whether one can use the techniques of spectrum reconstruction to determine the masses of mesons or hadrons are something that should be investigated in the future. Furthermore, beyond the interest in QFT spectra, one could simply also use calculations of the type performed in this paper to analyse the quasinormal spectrum of black holes or black branes, without any reference to holography. Finally, it should be said that in the end, the chosen method of reconstruction, so long as the method works, is unimportant. What is important from the point of view of physics is that numerous, sometimes all modes in a spectrum of a correlator in an interacting QFT are intimately related and that each can contain information about the physics at all energy scales, vastly beyond their naively perceived regime of applicability. With this work, our attempt was to make this transparent and also provide a rigorous and practical method for such reconstructions that can stretch from the deep infra-red to the extreme ultra-violet. Perhaps, from the point of view of a Wilsonian EFT (with an infinite number of irrelevant terms), we could say that in such spectra, or even theories, the renormalisation group is actually a group with an existing and practically implementable inverse."

In practice, we focus on cases in which the point where the series is given (we choose it to be the origin z = 0) is a branch point of the same order as the branch\n\u2013 35 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 1\npoint at z1 where the re-expansion takes place. As in the paper, we take the order to be p = 2. In such cases, the two functions r(z) and q(z) in the ansatz (3.2) are no longer analytic in |z| < |z1|. We instead change the ansatz to\nf(z) \u223c ( rE(z) + z\u2212\u03bdrO(z) ) (z \u2212 z1)\u2212\u03bd + qE(z) + z\u2212\u03bdqO(z), (A.1)\nas z \u2192 z1, where, now, the functions rE , rO, qE and qO are all analytic in the disk |z| < |z1|.

Moreover, to determine the coefficients rE and rO of the function rE(z) + z\u2212\u03bdrO(z) controlling the singularity, we must perform the algorithm on even and odd coefficients separately. Similarly, to find the coefficients of the expansion for the two functions qE and qO, we again make use of an auxiliary function g(z) defined exactly as in eq.

The new variable is defined as\nz = w2. (A.9)\nIf we use this transformation, the starting coefficients an of the expansion in the w-plane are the same as the original ones, while the branch point positions and the coefficients of the re-expansion change compared to their values in the z-plane. In particular, if the original critical points are at positions z = zi, then the new ones (in the w-plane) are at w = \u00b1\u221azi. This fact can prove inconvenient when undertaking further re-expansion steps since the number of critical points becomes doubled. Moreover, when determining the coefficients bn of the expansion\n\u221e\u2211 n=0 bn(z \u2212 z1)n/2 (A.10)\naround z1, the algorithm (3.25) gives us the coefficients b\u0303n, which are connected to the original coefficients bn by expressions\nb\u03032n = n\u2211\nk=dn2 e (2w1)2k\u2212n\n( k\nn\u2212 k\n) b2k,\nb\u03032n+1 = n\u2211 k=0 (2w1)2k\u2212n+1/2 ( k + 1/2 n\u2212 k ) b2k+1.\n(A.11)\nAfter obtaining the coefficients b\u0303n one therefore has to solve the above equations in order to calculate bn."

(B.9)\nAs for the form of the re-expansion algorithm used in the main text, the coefficients f `,mk,n , g`,mk,n , h `,m k,n and j `,m k,n equal to zero for k = `+ 1, . . . , `+m and so the expression\nY m`,n \u2212 1\nRn\u22122m \u2211\u0300 k=0 [ \u03b1k ( f `,mk,n C \u03bd\u2212k n\u22122m+1 + g `,m k,nC \u03bd\u2212k n\u22122m ) +R\u03b2k ( h`,mk,nC \u03bd\u2212k n\u22122m + j `,m k,nC \u03bd\u2212k n\u22122m\u22121 )] ,\n(B.10) scales as n\u03bd\u22122m\u2212`\u22122 when n\u2192\u221e. Setting it to zero at multiple n allows us to determine the first ` coefficients \u03b1k and \u03b2k. Having obtained the coefficients \u03b1k and \u03b2k, the coefficients rn of the series expansion\u2211\u221e n=0 rn(z\u2212 z1)n of r(z) in (3.41) around z = z1 are then obtained through matching with the expansion of (z \u2212 z2)\u2212\u03bdR(z) around z = z1. They are given in terms of \u03b1k and \u03b2k by\nrn = n\u2211 k=0\n(2iR sin \u03b8)2k\u2212n\u2212\u03bd [ 2iR sin \u03b8 ( k \u2212 \u03bd\nn\u2212 k \u2212 1\n) \u03b2k + ( k \u2212 \u03bd n\u2212 k ) (\u03b1k + z1\u03b2k) ] , (B.11)\nwhere we have again used z1 = Rei\u03b8.\n\u2013 38 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 1\nIn order to find the coefficients of the function Q(z), we define the auxiliary function g(z):\ng(z) \u2261 (\n1\u2212 z z1\n)\u03bd ( 1\u2212 z\nz2\n)\u03bd f(z) = \u221e\u2211 n=0 gnz n = R(z) + ( 1\u2212 z z1 )\u03bd ( 1\u2212 z z2 )\u03bd Q(z),\n(B.12) where the series coefficients gn are given by\ngn = \u221e\u2211 m=0 1 zn\u2212m1\n( n\u2212m\u2212 \u03bd \u2212 1\nn\u2212m\n) 2F1 ( m\u2212 n,\u2212\u03bd, \u03bd + 1 +m\u2212 n; e2i\u03b8 ) am. (B.13)\nWe now similarly multi-Taylor expand the function Q(z) as\nQ(z) = \u221e\u2211 k=0 (\u03b3k + z\u03b4k)(z \u2212 z1)k(z \u2212 z2)k (B.14)\nand use the above procedure on the coefficients gn to calculate \u03b3k and \u03b4k. In order to get the subleading coefficients of q(z) in the expansion (3.41), we compare the expansions of q(z) and Q(z) and get\nqn = n\u2211 k=0\n(2iR sin \u03b8)2k\u2212n [ 2iR sin \u03b8 ( k\nn\u2212 k \u2212 1\n) \u03b4k + ( k\nn\u2212 k\n) (\u03b3k + z1\u03b4k) ] . (B.15)\nNote that the above expression is different from eq. (B.11) as in that case we used the coefficients \u03b1k and \u03b2k to get the coefficients of r(z), leaving outside the factor of (z\u2212z1)\u2212\u03bd . In the present case, we use the coefficients \u03b3k and \u03b4k to calculate the coefficients of A(z) leaving outside both factors (z \u2212 z1)\u2212\u03bd and (z \u2212 z\u22171)\u2212\u03bd . In this manner, we reconstruct the full Puiseux series representation of f(z) around one of the two closest critical points (z1), where again,\nf(z) = f+(z) = \u2212i \u221e\u2211 n=0 e i\u03c0n 2 bn (z \u2212 z1)n/2 , (B.16)\nwith bn given in terms of rn and qm,\nb2n = iqne\u2212in\u03c0, b2n+1 = rn\u221a z1 e\u2212i(n+ 1 2 )\u03c0. (B.17)\nThe two branches of expansions are then related by the following expression:\nf\u00b1(z) = \u2212i \u221e\u2211 n=0 e\u00b1 i\u03c0n 2 bn (z \u2212 z1)n/2 . (B.18)"

Locations of the poles of the Pad\u00e9 approximant P0(z; 0) of order [40, 40]. With red colour, we plot the two poles (\u2018accumulation points\u2019) that we use as the approximate locations of the two closest critical points z1 and z\u22171 .\nby the method of the Pad\u00e9 approximant. This method was for example used in the analysis of a holographic model in ref. [22]. There, when the Pad\u00e9 approximant was applied to a series such as (2.6), its poles converged to the closest (convergence-limiting) branch points and the second Riemann sheet could be obtained with the use of the branch point unwinding described in appendix A.2 directly from the Pad\u00e9 approximant. Here, we first describe this well-established method and then compare it with the one based on the Darboux theorem for a single step re-expansion in our main example of the holographic theory in the AdS4Schwarzschild black brane bulk, which was discussed in section 4.2.\nGiven some function f(z), we define its Pad\u00e9 approximant of order [MN ,MD] around the point z = z0 as\nP(z; z0) = \u2211MN n=0An(z \u2212 z0)n\n1 + \u2211MD n=1Bn(z \u2212 z0)n , (C.1)\nwhere the coefficients An and Bn are chosen so that the Taylor expansions around z = z0 of the function f(z) and its approximant P(z; z0) match up to order MN +MD. Given the Taylor expansion representation of a hydrodynamic mode w0(z) around z = 0,\nw0(z) = N\u2211 n=1 anz n, (C.2)\na simple choice one can make is to take the Pad\u00e9 approximant P0(z; 0) of order [N/2, N/2]. One may then attempt to use this rational function to first determine the position(s) of the closest branch point(s) to z = z0 in the complex z-plane. As expected, for our example discussed in section 4.2, we find that the poles of P0(z; 0) do indeed accumulate at the locations of the closest pair of branch points z1 and z\u22171 , \u2018signifying\u2019 the closest non-analyticities of the function w0(z). We show this in figure 12 by plotting the positions of the poles in the z-plane.\nIn order to calculate the coefficients of the series around z1, we must not directly Taylor expand P0(z; 0) around z1, as this expansion is of course divergent. Instead, we introduce\n\u2013 40 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 1\na new variable u (see also ref. [22]):\nz\nz1 = \u2212u(u+ 2). (C.3)\nIn this way, we \u2018unwind\u2019 the branch point at z = z1 and move the origin of one sheet to u = 0 while the other is then at u = \u22122. The branch point is now at u = \u22121. Inserting z = \u2212z1u(u+ 2) into the original series (C.2), i.e., w0(\u2212z1u(u+ 2)), and constructing the Pad\u00e9 approximant around u = 0 and u = \u22122, we obtain the approximants P0(u; 0) and P1(u;\u22122) for the two sheets, respectively. This is analogous to the connection between eqs. (2.7) and (2.8). Expanding the approximant P1(u;\u22122) around u = \u22121 then gives us the desired Puiseux series: the first gapped mode\u2019s dispersion relation w1 expanded around the leading level-crossing critical point z1 where w1 collides with w0. We now also briefly comment on the obtained results. By using the same number of starting coefficients N0 = 300 as in section 4.2, this procedure determines the closest branch point zcalc1 to only 3 significant figures. This is rather poor compared to the 18 significant figures precision that we obtained from the Darboux theorem (without any optimisation). Therefore, when it comes to the determination of the branch point position in this example, the method of the Pad\u00e9 approximant clearly underperforms. With the calculated zcalc1 , the precision of the coefficients that follow from P1(u;\u22122) is also expectedly poor. In particular, we satisfactorily determine only the first coefficient of the Puiseux series expansion around z1 to 1 significant figure precision, while all higher coefficients are completely unreliable. Nevertheless, what is fascinating is that even with the branch point determined to only 3 significant figures, one is still able to obtain the value of the gap by directly evaluating the Pad\u00e9 approximant P1(u;\u22122) at u = 0 to the incredible precision of 17 significant figures. This has to be compared with the precision of 2 significant figures with which we calculated the gap using a combination of the Darboux theorem and the Pad\u00e9 approximant (as the analytic continuation within the same Riemann sheet).\nTo further test and compare the methods, it is also instructive to use the numerically obtained value of the branch point z1 that can be determined directly from the spectral curve. The results that follow from the Pad\u00e9 approximant are then dramatically better than those obtained from the Darboux theorem. One can determine the gap to the precision of 26 significant figures and calculate the first 80 coefficients of the Puiseux series to precision of more than 10 significant figures.\nIn conclusion, we find that for the holographic example we studied in this work, the Pad\u00e9 approximant method is less effective than the Darboux theorem. The main reason for this seems to be the error that arises from determining the location of the relevant branch point. However, if the branch point is for some reason known exactly, then the Pad\u00e9 approximant works extremely well. From a different standpoint, we note that the \u2018ad-hoc\u2019 way in which the accumulation point of the poles must be selected is arguably the most theoretically unsatisfying feature of Pad\u00e9 approximants. Moreover, the locations of the spurious poles from the denominator may also cause considerable problems at different stages of the reconstruction. In this sense, the method of Darboux clearly appears to be better controlled. On the other hand, for certain questions, Pad\u00e9 approximants are\n\u2013 41 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 2 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 3 1\nsimpler to implement, we saw that they performed extremely well in determining the gap (the approximant is an analytic continuation to certain regions outside the convergence disk in its own right) and can even be used when dealing with asymptotic series. Using a combination of different methods in parallel (which also allows for various cross-checks) therefore unsurprisingly appears to be the best strategy.\nOpen Access.
