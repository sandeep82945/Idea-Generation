Exploring Dynamic Pricing Mechanisms for MaaS Platforms: Investigate dynamic pricing models that adapt to real-time demand and supply changes within MaaS platforms. This research could explore how variable pricing affects operator revenue, user satisfaction, and overall system stability, considering both fixed-route services and MOD services.

Evaluating the Impact of Advanced Technologies on MOD Operations: Study the effect of emerging technologies, such as autonomous vehicles and AI-driven demand forecasting, on the efficiency, cost, and operational strategies of Mobility-on-Demand services within MaaS platforms. This research could also assess how these technologies influence market entry decisions and coopetition between operators.

Assessing User Heterogeneity and Equity in MaaS Systems: Deepen the understanding of how different user groups (e.g., by income level, mobility needs, or accessibility requirements) are affected by MaaS system designs. Research could focus on designing inclusive MaaS platforms that address equity concerns and ensure that services cater to the needs of diverse populations, including underserved communities.

Developing Integrated Policy Frameworks for MaaS Regulation: Propose and evaluate regulatory and policy frameworks that support the sustainable development of MaaS ecosystems. This research could include analyses of subsidy mechanisms, data-sharing requirements, and interoperability standards that encourage collaboration among providers while safeguarding user privacy and promoting equity.

Investigating the Environmental and Urban Impacts of MaaS: Explore the broader environmental and urban planning implications of widespread MaaS adoption. This research could examine how MaaS platforms influence urban mobility patterns, traffic congestion, public transit usage, and greenhouse gas emissions. It could also assess strategies for integrating MaaS platforms with existing urban infrastructure and public transportation networks to promote sustainable urban mobility.
