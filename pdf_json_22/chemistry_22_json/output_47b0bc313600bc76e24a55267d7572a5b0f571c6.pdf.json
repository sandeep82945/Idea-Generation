The key step on this reaction is\nthe formation of an oxocarbenium ion that reacts with 1 equiv of the \u03c0-component in an intermolecular (Scheme 1, top) or intramolecular fashion (Scheme 1, bottom). Depending on the structure of the alkene and the presence/absence of an external nucleophile, this initial carbocationic intermediate can evolve through different pathways, leading to the formation of a variety of substituted oxygen-containing carbo- or heterocycles\n(typically from five- to seven-membered rings) in a straightforward way.\nDue to the high utility of this reaction as a key strategic tool in organic synthesis, the last years have witnessed significant advances, focused on the following aspects that have widened the scope and utility of the Prins reaction: (section 2) the search for new catalytic systems with improved performance, (section 3) the diversification of the components that can be used in the reaction, (section 4) the incorporation of the Prins reaction in complex cascade processes, and (section 5) the development of enantioselective versions.

This strategy has been applied to a variety of substrates incorporating a methyl substituent in different positions of the tethering alkyl chain, giving very good yields and moderate diastereoselectivities in all cases tested.\nThe performance of the Prins reaction can also be improved by using supramolecular catalysts that can confine the reacting substrate in a close environment that stabilizes the intermediates and facilitates the overall process. In this sense, Toste, Bergman, and co-workers have employed a galliumderived supramolecular architecture that presents cationstabilizing abilities together with hydrophobic properties in the interior part, conditions highly beneficial for the Prins reaction to occur (Scheme 4).7 The authors have evaluated the reaction with two citronellal-like aldehydes, observing complete conversion and excellent yield accompanied by very good stereoselectivities. It should be noted that the\nreaction in the absence of this catalyst results in the nonselective formation of a mixture of alkene hydration byproducts. Importantly, this reaction is performed in a slightly basic pH solution, representing a good alternative for other methodologies carried out in highly acidic solutions."

            "text": "Although the Prins cyclization has been typically carried out by using an alkene moiety as the \u03c0-donor, together with an alcohol and an aldehyde, one of these three components can be replaced by some other modified reactants, widening the scope of the Prins reaction to provide products of different natures. In this sense, although simple alkenes are the most used \u03c0components, alkynes8 or diynes9 can be used in the reaction. For instance, when unsubstituted 3-alkynols are employed in the FeX3-promoted Prins reaction with aldehydes, the expected halogenated dihydropyrans are obtained as the final products, with the iron halide acting as both a Lewis acid and nucleophilic halide source that terminates the reaction (Scheme 5, top). However, when an internal alkyne was\nplaced at the substrate, the pyran adduct was obtained as a minor product, with the preferential formation of the regioisomeric alkylidenetetrahydrofuran that arises from the corresponding 5-exo-dig cyclization on the oxocarbenium intermediate. This behavior is also illustrated in the reaction with homopropargyldiynes (Scheme 5, bottom), in which bisalkylidenetetrahydofurans are obtained as a consequence of the structure of the intermediate generated during the Prins cyclization that undergoes a molecular reorganization, which\nScheme 2.

This strategy allowed the preparation of dimethylidenetetrahydropyrans in good to excellent yields and as a single diastereoisomer.\nVery recently, Banerjee and co-workers have studied the behavior of cyclopropanecarbaldehydes as substrates in the Prins type reaction.11 The particular nature of the cyclopropane ring attached to the aldehyde moiety makes this transformation very interesting from a synthetic point of view, since it represents a straightforward methodology for accessing oxygen-containing medium-sized rings by the concomitant ring opening of the cyclopropane (Scheme 7). In this reaction, the\nuse of an alkyne as the \u03c0-donor in the reaction implies the addition of a second halide in a subsequent transannular Prinstype reaction, leading to the formation of a bicyclic core in moderate to good yield.\nSimilarly, methylenecyclopropanecarbynols have been evaluated in a Prins cyclization promoted by a Br\u00f8nsted acid such as MsOH or p-TsOH (Scheme 8).12 This reaction generates alkylidenetetrahydropyrans with almost complete 2,5-cis stereoselection and also retaining the configuration of the alkylidene substituent of the starting material. The mechanism proposed by the authors is based on a Prins reaction that\noccurs through a six-membered transition state in a chairlike conformation. Interestingly, the reaction was also demonstrated to be fully enantiospecific, showing complete transfer of enantiomeric excess from the substrate to the product when an enantiomerically enriched carbinol was employed as the starting material.\nThere has also been intense research directed toward the identification of alternative reagents that can be employed as the source of the aldehyde/ketone electrophilic reagent. This enables the use of substrates that are not compatible with the typically strong Lewis/Br\u00f8nsted acids employed to promote the Prins reaction or that fail to generate the required oxocarbenium ion. This is the case when ketones are employed as substrates, due to their poor ability to condense with the homoallylic alcohol because of their poorer electrophilicity compared to that of aldehydes. A solution to this problem involves the possibility of employing allylic alcohols together with a transition-metal catalyst, the latter being involved in the isomerization of the allylic alcohol to generate a thermodynamically more stable enol intermediate. Next, this intermediate undergoes a Prins reaction in the presence of a Lewis acid used as a second catalyst that generates the reactive oxocarbenium ion intermediate. A good example of this approach is shown in Scheme 9, in which Scheidt and co-\nworkers employed a combination of an iridium-based catalyst with bismuth triflate for the Prins cyclization of indolylsubstituded allylic ethers to obtain a variety of fused pyranoindoles in good yields.13\nAnother important methodology for the easy formation of oxonium ions has been introduced by Wang and co-workers employing Au(I) as a catalyst (Scheme 10).14 In this example,\nhomoallylic alcohols containing an alkyne lateral chain underwent cyclization in the presence of a catalytic amount of cationic gold catalyst, the latter being involved in the activation of the alkyne moiety. This generated a cyclic oxonium ion that subsequently experienced an intramolecular Prins-type reaction that delivered the final oxabicylclo[3.3.1]alkane adducts.\nScheme 6.

            "text": "The inherent mechanistic profile of the Prins reaction makes it very appropriate for the implementation of a cascade process, through the design of a functionalized starting material in which there is a secondary functionality ready to interact with the carbocation intermediate formed after the initial addition of the \u03c0-component to the oxicarbenium ion.15 Scheme 11\nshows a representative example of this strategy in total synthesis. In their report, Li and co-workers have used a Prins cyclization followed by a Wagner\u2212Meerwein rearrangement that enables the construction of the central core of arcutinidine and arcutinine natural products.16 Under the optimized reaction conditions, the reaction proceeded with complete diastereocontrol during the cyclization step which, in combination with the stereospecific nature of the subsequent Wagner\u2212Meerwein rearrangement, led to the target compound with complete stereocontrol. Remarkably, this transformation could also be carried out on a gram scale, which facilitated its application to the total synthesis of both natural products through an additional 10 and 11 steps, respectively.\nThe carbocation that is formed after the initial Prins cyclization can also serve as a reactive center for initiating other types of cascades. For instance, Scheme 12 shows one\nexample in which a nucleophilic functional group present in the starting material can undergo addition to the carbocation, leading to more complex structures.17 In this case, an indole moiety was incorporated as the nucleophilic site, which is involved in a Friedel\u2212Crafts cyclization that followed the Prins reaction. The overall process occurred with complete diastereoselectivity."

            "text": "In the particular case of the Prins cyclization, several methodologies based on chiral auxiliaries have been recently developed for accessing enantioenriched cyclic compounds in\nan asymmetric way. In this sense, strategies that use asymmetric catalysis are scarce. One of the first catalytic enantioselective version of the Prins cyclization was reported only few years ago by Lalli and van de Weghe (Scheme 13).18\nIn this report, a combination of a Lewis acid (CuCl) together with a chiral Br\u00f8nsted bis-phosphoric acid derived from BINOL was identified as the best catalyst system. The overall process consists of a cascade Prins/intramolecular Friedel\u2212 Crafts type alkylation, leading to a family of benzo[f ]- isochromenes in good yield and diastereoselectivities and moderate enantioselectivities.\nChiral N-triflylphosphoramides have been also evaluated as catalysts for the enantioselective Prins cyclization between different enals and glyoxylates (Scheme 14).19 In this reaction,\nthe oxocarbenium ion is generated by the addition of the glyoxylate aldehyde oxygen to the enal substrate in the presence of the Br\u00f8nsted acid and is followed by the Prins cyclization and final carbocationic quench by the remaining hemiacetal moiety, ending up in the formation of a bicyclic compound. The selectivity observed in this process can be explained by the initial attack of the alkene moiety to the Econfigured carbenium ion under stereochemical control by the chiral acid catalyst followed by a 6-exo-trig cyclization and the final nucleophilic addition of the hemiacetal through a boatlike conformation, producing the 2,6-dioxabicyclo[2.2.2]octane in good yields and excellent enantioselectivities in almost all cases.\nA more general strategy for performing a catalytic enantioselective Prins cyclization has been presented by List and co-workers, enabling the straightforward synthesis of\nScheme 11.

This methodology has been applied for the synthesis of several fragrances by simple hydrogenation of the exocyclic double bond.\nSimilar reaction conditions were also used for the preparation of enantioenriched tetrahydrofurans, in this case involving a 5-exo-trig cyclization in the intramolecular addition to the oxocarbenium ion (Scheme 16).21 In this particular case,\na less acidic chiral imidodiphosphate catalyst was found to be the most efficient one when the reaction was performed using aromatic or heteroaromatic aldehydes, while a more acidic imidodiphosphorimidate was necessary when aliphatic aldehydes were used. This methodology allows the preparation of 2,3-disubstituted tetrahydrofurans in excellent trans-selectivity with enantioselectivities in the range of 84\u221298%.\nVery recently, these two last strategies have been used for performing an enantioselective cascade Prins cyclization/azaMichael process (Scheme 17).22 For this reaction, 3- or 4-enols bearing a 2-hydroxyphenyl substituent were combined with substituted anthranilic aldehydes, both reagents condensing under phosphoric acid catalysis to generate the oxocarbenium ion. After the Prins cyclization took place in an exo-trig mode, a o-quinone methide was generated, which underwent an azaMichael reaction. The overall process produced a single diastereoisomer in good yields and excellent enantioselectivities in the presence of a chiral phosphoric acid catalyst, which not only provided enantiocontrol to the Prins cyclization but also assisted the dearomatization of the phenol that initiated the process through a rigid chairlike transition state.\nIn conclusion, impressive advances have been made in the past few years that have improved the potential of the Prins\nreaction as a general tool in synthesis. Not only have new catalytic systems been developed that enable carrying out the reaction using more accessible reagents/catalysts or under environmentally friendly conditions but also the reaction has significantly widened its scope through the use of complex starting materials that have unveiled previously untrodden reactivity profiles. In addition, the recently reported catalytic and enantioselective versions of this venerable reaction have contributed to solve a longstanding problem in trying to apply this reaction for the synthesis of a chiral compound in an enantioenriched form. Despite such enormous advances, this is still a highly active field and future improvements are also expected in the coming years, especially focused on potential applications of these new variants in high scale, directed toward chemical production at an industrial level. \u25a0 AUTHOR INFORMATION Corresponding Authors\nEfraim Reyes \u2212 Department of Organic and Inorganic Chemistry, University of the Basque Country (UPV/EHU), 48080 Bilbao, Spain; orcid.org/0000-0003-2038-9925; Email: efraim.reyes@ehu.es Jose L.

She graduated from the University of the Basque Country, Basque Country, Spain, in 2005 and received her Ph.D. in 2009, working in the development of organocatalytic conjugate additions under the direction of Prof. Dr. D. Badia and Prof. Jose L. Vicario. After postdoctoral studies with the group of Magnus Rueping in the RWTH Aachen (Germany) from 2010 to 2012, working in the use of chiral Br\u00f8nsted acid catalysts, she returned to Bilbao first as a postdoctoral associate (Juan de la Cierva) and now as an Associate Professor. Her current research activity focuses on the application of organocatalysis to trigger challenging organic reactions and their application to the synthesis of natural products.\nLuisa Carrillo was born in Bilbao in 1965. She graduated from the University of the Basque Country in 1988 and received her Ph.D. in 1998, working in the Department of Organic Chemistry for the Faculty of Science at the same University. Next she joined the Group of Asymmetric Synthesis under the direction of Prof. Dr. Badia. Her current research interests focus on the design of new methodologies in asymmetric synthesis and their application in the synthesis of pharmacologically active compounds.\nJose L. Vicario was born in Elda (Alicante, Spain) in 1973. He graduated from the University of the Basque Country in 1996 and received his Ph.D. in 2000 at the same University. After postdoctoral studies in 2002 at the RWTH Aachen (Germany), under the supervision of Prof. Dieter Enders, he returned to the Department of Organic and Inorganic Chemistry of the University of the Basque Country to start his independent career, where he is currently Full Professor. Current research interests focus on the design of new methodologies in asymmetric synthesis, especially asymmetric organocatalysis, and the stereocontrolled synthesis of pharmacologically active compounds.\n\u25a0 ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The authors thank the Spanish Agencia Estatal de Investigaci\u00f3n (FEDER-PID2020-118422-GB-I00) and the Basque Government (Grupos IT1558-22) for financial support.\n\u25a0 ABBREVIATIONS BINOL,1,1\u2032-bi-2-naphthol; Ms,mesyl; MS,molecular sieves; Ns,nosyl; SPINOL,1,1\u2032-spirobiindane-7,7\u2032-diol; Tf,triflyl; THF,tetrahydrofuran; TMS,trimethylsilyl; Ts,toluenesulfonyl\n\u25a0 REFERENCES (1) For excellent general reviews dedicated to the Prins reaction, see: (a) Doro, F.; Akeroyd, N.; Schiet, F.; Narula, A.
