Integration of Advanced Multisensor Fusion Techniques in HTPP: Developing methodologies for the integration of data from multiple sensor types (RGB, multispectral, hyperspectral, thermal, and LiDAR) on both sUAS and terrestrial platforms. This research could explore advanced data fusion techniques to enhance trait prediction accuracy and enable comprehensive phenotype profiling under varied environmental conditions.

Automated Data Processing Pipelines: Creating fully automated data processing and analysis pipelines for sUAS-based crop imagery. This research could focus on developing user-friendly software tools that automate the steps from image capture to phenotype extraction, including feature detection, image stitching, and machine learning-based analysis, to make HTPP more accessible and efficient.

Evaluation of Carotenoids via sUAS Imaging: Investigating the potential of sUAS-based imaging technologies to evaluate carotenoids in plants. Given the role of carotenoids in photosynthesis, stress responses, and defense mechanisms, this research could contribute to breeding efforts focused on stress resilience and crop protection.

HTPP in Horticultural Crops: Expanding the application of HTPP technologies to fruit and vegetable crops, with a focus on the unique challenges presented by these crops, such as controlled environment conditions, short production cycles, and high sensitivity to pests and diseases. This research could explore the potential of sUAS platforms to enhance early disease detection and optimize pest management practices.

Development of Low-Cost, High-Performance Sensors for HTPP: Researching and developing new sensor technologies that are both cost-effective and capable of high-performance phenotyping. This could include innovations in sensor design, manufacturing, and integration techniques that lower the entry barrier for HTPP technologies, particularly for small-scale breeding programs and in developing countries.
