INTRODUCTION\nThe Lorentz transformations exhibit an intriguing singular limit opposite to the Galilean one. The corresponding set of boosts, discovered independently by LevyLeblond [1] and Sen Gupta [2], are given by:\nt\u2032 = t\u2212 x\nw , x\u2032 = x, y\u2032 = y, z\u2032 = z, (1)\nwhere w is a parameter with the dimension of velocity. These transformations are obtained by replacing the relative frame velocity by c 2\nw in the original Lorentz trans-\nformations and then taking the limits of a small speed of light (c << w) as well as small temporal separations between events (c\u2206t << \u2206x). The parameter w, however, does not encode a physical velocity. Rather, it is the rate of motion \u2206x\u2206t in the unprimed frame of an event that is fixed in time in the primed frame. These boosts, along with the spatial rotations and spacetime translations, form what has been christened the \u2018Carroll\u2019 group. As shown by Levy Leblond [1, 3], this ten-parameter group could be obtained through a Ino\u0308nu\u0308-Wigner contraction of the Poincare group. Despite the nonstandard causal structure of the Levy Leblond-Sen Gupta spacetimes where the lightcone shrinks (almost) to a line, the Carrollian limit is found to be intimately connected to a remarkably wide range of physical contexts. For instance, a special case of this limit [4, 5] in the second order metric formulation of gravity could be related to the BKL behaviour [6] near a space-like singularity where time derivatives of fields are conjectured dominate over spatial ones. Carrollian physics is also relevant to the description of cosmological billiards [7], null surfaces [8, 9], tachyons [10], gravitational waves [11], non-AdS holography [12], inflationary cosmology [13], multi-metric gravity [14] and so on. The Levy Leblond-Sen Gupta spacetimes have been typically shown to arise in gravity theories where the metric is either exactly degenerate [15] or becomes so in a limiting sense [4, 5]. The latter case has also been interpreted as a c \u2192 0 (or \u2018strong coupling\u2019) limit. However,\n\u2217 sandipan@phy.iitkgp.ac.in\nsince c has dimensions, such an interpretation demands caution as operationally it may lead to more than one inequivalent limits of the seed field theory, depending on the units chosen to define the fundamental variables. In fact, examples of such inequivalent limiting formulations of gravity have appeared in the earlier literature within approaches based on the gauging of Carroll algebra [16\u2013 18] or through series expansions in powers of c2 within a Lagrangian framework [19].\nRecently, it has been claimed that relativistic field theories in general could admit two inequivalent Carroll limits [20]. This feature is exactly analogous to the \u2018electric\u2019 and \u2018magnetic\u2019 limits in Galilean electromagnetism [21], the basic variables in the two cases being assigned different units through relative factors of c.\nHere, we develop a Hamiltonian formulation of Carrollian gravity within a first order framework, where the canonical variables as well as the constraint structure differ nontrivially from the metric (ADM) formalism. After solving the second-class constraints, we obtain a canonical theory corresponding to the so-called magnetic Carroll phase of metric gravity. We also explicitly demonstrate that the limiting theory exhibits the same number of physical degrees of freedom as in Hilbert-Palatini (or, Einstein-Hilbert) gravity, even though form of the limiting constraints are significantly different from the original ones.\nNext, by introducing a different scaling prescription motivated from the non-uniqueness of the limit c \u2192 0, we demonstrate how a first-order analogue of the \u2018electric\u2019 limit of metric gravity could be formulated.\nThe final form of the Hamiltonian constraints in either limits are considerably simpler than the full constraint in pure gravity and are of interest from the canonical quantization perspective. Also, the latter case provides a remarkably simple Hamiltonian representation of the BKL conjecture [6, 22].\nIn the next section, we develop a canonical setup for the magnetic limit following a brief outline of the Hamiltonian structure of the Hilbert-Palatini theory. Based on an appro- priate scaling limit, we obtain the Carroll phase of the constraints without making any gauge choice. This is followed by a constraint analysis based on their Poisson algebra. The constraints in the time gauge are also found. In Sec. III, we introduce a different scaling pre-\n2 scription and find the resulting Hamiltonian theory. In time gauge, the asso- ciated Hamiltonian formulation is found to be the first-order counterpart of the electric limit in the metric formulation. The concluding section contains a few relevant remarks."

To begin with, let us consider the following limit [17] leading to a realization of the Carroll algebra, where the basic variables go to the new ones as:\ne\u03020\u00b5 = \u01ebe 0 \u00b5, e\u0302 i \u00b5 = e i \u00b5, \u03c9\u0302 0i \u00b5 = \u01eb\u03c9 0i \u00b5 , \u03c9\u0302 ij \u00b5 = \u03c9 ij \u00b5 ;\ne\u0302 \u00b5 0 =\n1 \u01eb e \u00b5 0 , e\u0302 \u00b5 i = e \u00b5 i . (3)\nThe unhatted variables are assumed to remain finite in the limit \u01eb \u2192 0, implying that the determinant e\u0302 approaches zero. In these redefined variables, the HilbertPalatini Lagrangian density becomes:\nL = \u01eb\n2\u03ba\u0302 ee\n\u00b5 I e \u03bd JR IJ \u00b5\u03bd (\u03c9)\nwhere the new field strengths R 0i\u00b5\u03bd = D\u0304[\u00b5\u03c9 0i \u03bd] := \u2202[\u00b5\u03c9 0i \u03bd] + \u03c9 ik [\u00b5 \u03c9 0k \u03bd] and R\u0304 ij \u00b5\u03bd = \u2202[\u00b5\u03c9 ij \u03bd] + \u03c9 ik [\u00b5 \u03c9 j \u03bd]k represent the SO(3) counterparts of the original ones (D\u0304\u00b5 denotes the SO(3) covariant derivative). Evidently, the Lagrangian density is well-defined provided the coupling scales as \u03ba\u0302 = \u01eb\u03ba. In what follows next, we set up a Hamiltonian formulation of the above limit within the first-order framework. We employ the standard Hamiltonian decomposition of the tetrad fields as [23, 24]:\ne\u0302It = \u221a e\u0302N\u0302M\u0302 I + N\u0302aV\u0302 Ia , e\u0302 I a = V\u0302 I a ; M\u0302I V\u0302 I a = 0, M\u0302IM\u0302 I = \u22121;\ne\u0302tI = \u2212 M\u0302I \u221a\ne\u0302N\u0302 , e\u0302aI = V\u0302 a I +\nN\u0302aM\u0302I \u221a\ne\u0302N\u0302 ;\nM\u0302 I V\u0302 aI := 0, V\u0302 I a V\u0302 b I := \u03b4 b a, V\u0302 I a V\u0302 a J := \u03b4 I J + M\u0302 IM\u0302J .\nThe spatial metric and its determinant are defined as: q\u0302ab := V\u0302 I a V\u0302bI and q\u0302 := detq\u0302ab , with e\u0302 := det(e\u0302 I \u00b5) = N\u0302 q\u0302. Using the identity,\ne\u0302 [a I e\u0302 b] J = N\u0302 e\u0302e\u0302 t [I e\u0302 [a K]e\u0302 b] [J e\u0302 t L]\u03b7 KL + N\u0302 [ae\u0302 b] [I e\u0302 t J],\nthe original Lagrangian density (2) becomes:\nL = e\u0302\n\u03ba [e\u0302tI e\u0302 a JR\u0302 IJ ta +\n1 2 (N\u0302 e\u0302e\u0302t[I e\u0302 [a K]e\u0302 b] [J e\u0302 t L]\u03b7 KL\n+N\u0302 [ae\u0302 b] [I e\u0302 t J])R\u0302 IJ ab ] (4)\nDefining the momenta conjugate to \u03c9\u0302 IJa as \u03a0\u0302 a IJ := e\u0302 \u03ba\u0302 e\u0302t[I e\u0302 a J], we may rewrite the above as:\nL = 1\n2 \u03a0\u0302aIJ\u2202t\u03c9\u0302 IJ a \u2212H (5)\nwhere the Hamiltonian density H is completely constrained owing to the absence of velocities corresponding for the fields N\u0302 , N\u0302a, \u03c9\u0302 IJt :\nH = N\u0302H\u0302 + N\u0302aH\u0302a + 1\n2 \u03c9\u0302 IJt G\u0302IJ (6)\nThe constraints read:\nH\u0302 = \u03ba\u0302\n2 \u03a0\u0302aIK\u03a0\u0302 b JL\u03b7 KLR\u0302 IJab \u2248 0,\nH\u0302a = 1\n2 \u03a0\u0302bIJR\u0302 IJ ab \u2248 0,\nG\u0302IJ = \u2212D\u0302a\u03a0\u0302 a IJ \u2248 0 (7)\nIn addition, the momenta are associated with six primary constraints, reflecting that only twelve of its components are independent:\nC\u0302ab := 1\n2 \u01ebIJKL\u03a0\u0302aIJ\u03a0\u0302 b KL \u2248 0 (8)\nWe may implement the Carroll limit (3) through the following redefinitions of the canonical variables, where, as earlier, the unhatted variables remain finite in the limit \u01eb \u2192 0:\n\u03c9\u0302 0i\u00b5 = \u01eb\u03c9 0i \u00b5 , \u03c9\u0302 ij \u00b5 = \u03c9 ij \u00b5 , \u03a0\u0302 a 0i =\n1 \u01eb \u03a0a0i, \u03a0\u0302 a ij = \u03a0 a ij ;\nN\u0302 = \u01ebN, N\u0302a = Na. (9)\nNote that these scalings preserve the symplectic form, as is necessary. The transformation of the lapse follows from the scaling of the tetrad determinant. Let us now analyse the Hamiltonian structure of gravity theory resulting from the above Carroll limit.

An immediate fact to be\n3 gleaned from the above is the vanishing Poisson bracket [H,H ] = 0, a characteristic of the Carroll algebra. The new vector constraint also retains only the SO(3) covariant derivative and field-strength in the limit:\nHa = \u03a0 b 0iD\u0304[a\u03c9 0i b] +\n1 2 \u03a0bijR\u0304 ij ab (11)\nProceeding similarly, we find the following limiting forms of the rotation and boost constraints:\nGij = \u2212D\u0304a\u03a0 a ij + \u03c9a0[i\u03a0 a0 j], G0i = \u2212D\u0304a\u03a0 a 0i (12)\nEvidently, the rotation constraint is the only one that exhibits no change when compared with the full HilbertPalatini constraints."

In this gauge, the solution of boost thus turns the associated conjugate momenta into a dependent variable as: \u03b6i = \u2202aE a i .\nLet us emphasize that in order to obtain the Carrollian constraints directly in time gauge, the limit should be taken after implementing the gauge. However, in this particular case here, this procedure is equivalent to taking the limit before imposing the gauge. In this gauge, the Carroll limit of the constraints could be read off from eq.(7) as:\nH = \u2212 \u03ba\n2 Eai E b j R\u0304 ij ab (E) \u2248 0,\nHa = E b i D\u0304[aQ i b] \u2248 0, Gij = Qa[iE a j] \u2248 0 (19)\n4 These form a system of first-class constraints, while obeying the Carroll algebra. With these set of constraints, one may directly proceed towards a canonical quantization. Let us add that the rotation constraint in time gauge could be solved as Qka = E l aM\nkl where Mkl = Mlk is an arbitrary field. This indeterminacy of the connection \u03c9 0ia resembles a similar feature found in the solutions of gravity theory where the tetrad fields are degenerate in an exact sense [15] (as opposed to the limiting sense as here). There it had been demonstrated that the Lagrangian equations of motion leave both \u03c9 0ia and \u03c9 ij a undetermined upto two symmetric fields Mkl and Nkl. On the other hand, this also shows that the degenerate limit of gravity is not really equivalent to a gravity theory based on exactly degenerate tetrad fields. We may also note that this ambiguity upto Mkl is equivalent to the one appearing within a Lagrangian description of the \u2018magnetic\u2019 Carroll limit of gravity [17], where a similar field shows up as a multiplier in the second order action."

This leaves two degrees of freedom per spacetime point in the Carroll phase of gravity. This is same as in Hilbert-Palatini gravity, despite the fact that the first case represents a singular limit of the latter and the explicit canonical form and details of the constraints exhibit nontrivial differences between the two cases.

A possible way to define a singular limit from the above is to keep the factors\n1 c e\u03020\u00b5 := e 0 \u00b5 and ce\u0302 \u00b5 0 = e \u00b5 0 finite as c \u2192 0, which implies:\ne\u03020\u00b5 \u2192 0, e\u0302 \u00b5 0 \u2192 \u221e. (20)\nThis is precisely the scaling prescription (3) discussed at the earlier section.

In order to avoid repetitions, we display the new constraints directly in the nonsingular variables using the same procedure elucidated in the earlier section."

            "text": "Here, we have set up a Hamiltonian formulation of the singular \u2018Carroll\u2019 limit of Hilbert-Palatini gravity. Through a detailed constraint analysis, we find that the number of physical degrees of freedom (locally) is two, which is the same as in the original theory. This answers an important and oft quoted open question [16, 17] in the literature regarding the number of polarization states in \u2018Carroll\u2019 gravity. The Carrollian Hamiltonian constraint in limit A (so called \u2018magnetic\u2019 limit) is free from any ordering ambiguity. It depends only on the momenta (Eai ) and their spatial derivatives. Owing to this simplication compared to the original Hilbert-Palatini gravity, this is an interesting candidate Hamiltonian to quantize. Furthermore, we provide a scaling prescription (limit B) based on the Levy-Leblond-Sen Gupta limit which naturally leads to a canonical form inequivalent to the first one (limit A). The associated constraints represent a first-order analogue of the so-called \u2018electric\u2019 limit of metric gravity. Limit B is expected to be relevant in the study of the celebrated BKL conjecture from a Hamiltonian viewpoint. Even though the corresponding Hamiltonian constraint, when quantized, exhibits an ordering ambiguity, it is purely algebraic (contains no derivatives\nof coordinate or momenta). Again, this is quite an attractive feature, as compared to the full Hamiltonian constraint of Hilbert-Palatini gravity. A quantization of this Hamiltonian theory could lead to new insights regarding a possible connection between quantum gravity and a potential resolution of gravitational singularities [25, 26]. To sum up, the Hamiltonian theories in the limits A and B both provide an intriguing arena for quantum gravity, modulo issues such as operator ordering, regularization or interpretational aspects. As a final remark, our analysis also shows that the Carrollian limit of gravity is in general inequivalent to a gravity theory based on an exactly degenerate tetrad. In fact, gravity theory in vacuum based on a noninvertible tetrad (metric) has recently been shown to be associated with three local degrees of freedom [27], reflecting a discontinuity in the limit to a vanishing tetrad determinant. Let us also observe that only one of the two undetermined symmetric fields which had been found to appear in the generic spacetime solutions with noninvertible tetrads [15] shows up in the Carrollian phase. It is plausible that there exist further limiting phases of HilbertPalatini gravity connected to the ones considered here, where the other symmetric field found in ref.[15] could enter the description. Some of these intriguing questions are worth a deeper study. 1."
