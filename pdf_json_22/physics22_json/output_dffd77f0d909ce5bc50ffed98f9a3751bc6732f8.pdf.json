Formalism of multiple internal reflections is generalized for analysis, that was developed for nuclear decays and captures by nuclei with high precision and tests. For the chosen reaction C+ C = Mg we find the following. A quantum study of the pycnonuclear reaction requires a complete analysis of quantum fluxes in the internal nuclear region. This reduces rate and number of pycnonuclear reactions by 1.8 times. This leads to the appearance of new states (called as quasibound states) where the compound nuclear system is formed with maximal probability. As shown, minimal energy of such a state is a little higher than energy of zero-point vibrations in lattice sites in pycnonuclear reaction, however probability of formation of compound system at the quasibound state is essentially larger than the corresponding probability at state of zero-point vibrations. Hence, there is a sense to tell about reaction rates in such quasibound states as more probable, rather than states of zero-point vibrations. This can lead to the essential changes in estimation of the rates of nuclear reactions in stars.",

But, difference in such estimations is not principal for our analysis, 19 so we will choose the density above given by Hamada and Salpeter for calculations. We will show below that quantum corrections change results essentially also",

Shaulskyi(2)\u2020 (1)Wigner Research Center for Physics, Budapest, 1121, Hungary and\n(2)Institute for Nuclear Research, National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine, Kyiv, 03680, Ukraine (Dated: May 30, 2022)\nPycnonuclear reactions in the compact stars at zero temperatures are studied on quantum mechanical basis in the paper. Formalism of multiple internal reflections is generalized for analysis, that was developed for nuclear decays and captures by nuclei with high precision and tests. For the chosen reaction 12C+ 12C = 24Mg we find the following. A quantum study of the pycnonuclear reaction requires a complete analysis of quantum fluxes in the internal nuclear region. This reduces rate and number of pycnonuclear reactions by 1.8 times. This leads to the appearance of new states (called as quasibound states) where the compound nuclear system is formed with maximal probability. As shown, minimal energy of such a state is a little higher than energy of zero-point vibrations in lattice sites in pycnonuclear reaction, however probability of formation of compound system at the quasibound state is essentially larger than the corresponding probability at state of zero-point vibrations. Hence, there is a sense to tell about reaction rates in such quasibound states as more probable, rather than states of zero-point vibrations. This can lead to the essential changes in estimation of the rates of nuclear reactions in stars.\nKeywords: pycnonuclear reaction, compact star, neutron star, multiple internal refleclections, coefficients of penetrability and reflection, fusion, quasibound state, compound nucleus, dense nuclear matter, tunneling\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIn thermonuclear reaction in stars, the thermal energy of the reacting nuclei overcomes the Coulomb repulsion between them so that the reaction can proceed. At sufficiently high densities, even at zero temperature, zeropoint energy of the nuclei in a lattice can lead to an appreciable rate of reactions. This phenomenon is known as pycnonuclear reaction (from \u201cpyknos\u201d as \u201cdense\u201d in Greek) [1]. Insight to these reactions was given by Zel\u2019dovich proposed to estimate zero-point energy as some fixed energy of discrete energy spectrum for potential of harmonic oscillatoric type formed at closest approximation at middle point between two nuclei in lattice [2]. Rates of reactions derived at such zero-point energies are estimated for some atomic nuclei in lattices in compact stars [3]. Pycnonuclear burning occurs in dense and cold cores of white dwarfs [4] and in crusts of accreting neutron stars [5, 6]. Pycnonuclear reactions in compact stars have been studied where stellar matter is considered as multicomponent and dense. Key process in these reactions is fusion of nuclei with formation of new nucleus with larger mass. In Ref. [7] this process was analyzed for reactions containing atomic nuclei of different types, where authors derived the astrophysical S-factors for carbon-oxygen and oxygen-oxygen fusion reactions on the microscopic basis. Phenomenological expressions for reaction rates containing several fit parameters were found, which can be effective for fast calculations. In Ref. [8] the astrophysical S-factors were estimated for 946 fusion reactions involving stable and neutron-rich isotopes of C, O, Ne, and Mg for center-of-mass energies varying from 2 to \u2248 18\u201330 MeV (see also Ref. [9]). Large collection of astrophysical S factors and their compact representation was presented in Ref. [10] for isotopes of Be, B, C, N, O, F, Ne, Na, Mg, and Si (database of S factors was created for about 5000 nonresonant fusion reactions). Important question in this topic is influence of structure of the multi-component matter (a regular lattice, a uniform mix, etc.) on nuclear processes in reactions which has been studied by many researchers. But, from previous study it has been known that study of quantum fluxes in the internal region of nuclear system in reaction can essentially change cross-sections and other characteristics of reactions (see Refs. [11\u201313], reference therein). That question has not been taken into account yet and, so, it is a subject of our current study in this paper. From previous study of nuclear processes in captures of \u03b1 particles by nuclei [12, 13] we concluded about importance to take into account internal shape of nuclear potential. In particular, analysis of quantum processes before fusion shows that resulting cross-sections can be varied up 4 times for energies of beams of \u03b1 particles used in experiments (i.e., changes of cross-sections can be larger than 100 percents). Such changes are controlled by additional independent\n\u2217Electronic address: sergei.maydanyuk@wigner.hu \u2020Electronic address: konstiger1998@live.com\n2 parameters appeared from fully quantum study.1 With method in Ref. [12], new parametrization of the \u03b1-nucleus potential and fusion probabilities were found (see Fig. 6, Table 2 and B.3 in that paper) and error in a description of experimental data is decreased by 41.72 times for \u03b1+40Ca and 34.06 times for \u03b1+44Ca in comparison with previously existed results (see Fig. 5 and Table 1 in that paper, for details). Up to present, this is the most accurate approach in description of experimental data for the \u03b1-capture (this is calculation given by the blue solid line in Fig. 3 (b) in Ref. [13] for \u03b1+ 44Ca in comparison with experimental data [15]). This pure quantum effect is ignored in estimations of cross-sections based on the semiclassical calculations of penetrability of the barrier. On such a motivation, we are interesting in analysis of quantum processes for pycnonuclear reactions in compact stars on this fully quantum basis. In this paper we are focusing on aspects where quantum effects play essential role in reactions of such a type. Important in that direction is that fully quantum study introduced tests based on quantum mechanics, which allow to check calculations. In frameworks of approach [12, 13], accuracy of the calculated characteristics is about of 10\u221214, while outside such a quantum approach accuracy is based on the semiclassical calculations of the first order, that can be about 10\u22121\u201310\u22123 inside energy region where such an approximation is applied (if to ignore role of additional independent quantum parameters indicated above). Moreover, energies for the pycnonuclear reactions are low and there are only processes of deep tunneling under the barrier where the semiclassical approximation cannot be applied at all. This reinforces our interest to this problem. The paper is organized in the following way. In Sec. II a new generalized formalism of multiple internal reflections is presented with focus on description of pycnonuclear reactions. In Sec. III A pycnonuclear reaction for 12C+12C = 24Mg [16] on the basis of fully quantum approach and without it is given, supported by calculations of penetrabilities of the barrier, tests, probabilities of formation of the compound nucleus, estimation of energies and other quantum characteristics for quasibound states, rates of reactions, etc.. We summarize conclusions in Sec. IV. In Appendix A formulas for calculations of rates of reactions in compact stars, with fusion probabilities and without those are added.\nII. TUNNELING OF PARTICLE THROUGH THE BARRIER ON SEMIAXIS (RADIAL PROBLEM)\nA. Potential with barrier of the simplest shape: Multiple internal reflections method in description of scattering of particle (with possibility of capture)\nWe shall study the capture of the particle by the nucleus in the spherically symmetric consideration. To generalize an idea of the multiple internal reflections on the capture problem and to study packet tunneling through complicated realistic barriers, let us consider the simplest radial potential, which allows to describe a scattering of the particle on it with a possible propagation into the internal region. The simples potential convenient for this aim is2\nV (r) =\n{\nV1 at rmin < r \u2264 r1 (region 1), 0 at r1 \u2264 r \u2264 rmax (region 2), (1)\nwhere V1 < 0. Let us denote the internal and external regions by numbers 1 and 2 (we suppose rmin \u2265 0). We assume that particle from external region 2 is incident on nucleus with possibility to capture it by the nucleus in the region 1 after its transfer through a boundary between two regions at r1, or reflection and leaving outside n region 2. A general solution of the wave function has the following form:\n\u03c8(r, \u03b8, \u03d5) = \u03c7(r)\nr Ylm(\u03b8, \u03d5), (2)\n\u03c7(r) =\n{\n\u03b11 e ik1r + \u03b21 e \u2212ik1r at rmin < r \u2264 r1 (region 1), e\u2212ik2r + AR e ik2r at r1 \u2264 r \u2264 rmax (region 2), (3)\n1 Simple understanding about new independent parameters can be obtained from comparison of wave function in the first and second approximations in semiclassical approximation. In particular, wave function in the second approximation includes momentum and force as additional parameters (for example, see Eq. (46,9), (46,11) in Ref. [14], p. 210). This can be indication to add dynamical characteristics of quantum process (which can be described in the stationary formalism). More details can be obtained if to study 2D tunneling in quantum mechanics. 2 This approximation for barriers of the proton- and \u03b1-decays for nuclei with width of each step about 0.01 fm was used previously, stability and convergence of calculations of amplitudes of the wave function and penetrability were demonstrated (for example, see Ref. [17]). So, we have effective tools for a detailed study of the quantum processes of tunneling and penetrability.\n3 where \u03b11 and \u03b21 are unknown amplitudes, AT and AR are unknown amplitudes of transition and reflection, Ylm(\u03b8, \u03d5) is the spherical function, and kj = 1 h\u0304 \u221a\n2m(E \u2212 Vj) are complex wave numbers (j = 1, 2, V2 = 0). We fix a normalization of the wave function so that a modulus of amplitude of the incident wave e\u2212ik2r equals unity. We shall search a solution of this problem by the multiple internal reflections approach.\n1. Approach of step-by-step\nAccording to the multiple internal reflections method, the scattering of a particle on the barrier is sequentially considered by steps of propagation of the wave (wave packet) relative to each boundary of the barrier (idea of this approach can be understood most clearly in the problem of tunneling through the simplest rectangular barrier, see Refs. [18\u201320], where one can find proof of this fully quantum exactly solvable method and analyze its properties in details). In the first step we consider the wave e\u2212ik2r in region 2, which is incident on the boundary at r1 outside. This wave is transformed into new wave \u03b2 (1) 1 e \u2212ik1r propagated to the center in the region 1, and new wave \u03b1 (1) 2 e ik2r which is reflected from the boundary and propagated outside in the region 2 [see Fig. 1 (a)]. For such a process we\nOO\nhave such wave function:\n\u03c7(1)(r) =\n{\n\u03b2 (1) 1 e \u2212ik1r at rmin < r \u2264 r1, e\u2212ik2r + \u03b1\n(1) 2 e ik2r at r1 \u2264 r \u2264 rmax. (4)\nHere, \u03b1 (1) 2 and \u03b2 (1) 1 are two unknown amplitudes (we add upper index denoting number of step). We find them from condition of continuity of the full wave function and its derivative at r1:\n\u03b1 (1) 2 = R \u2212 1 = k \u2212 k1 k + k1 e\u22122ikr1 , \u03b2 (1) 1 = T \u2212 1 = 2k k + k1 e\u2212i(k\u2212k1)r1 , (5)\nwhere\nR\u22121 = k \u2212 k1 k + k1 e\u22122ikr1 , T\u22121 = 2k k + k1 e\u2212i(k\u2212k1)r1 . (6)\nNow, let us analyze a sense of these new waves. The transmitted wave is formed inside the internal nuclear region. So, it describes formation of the compound nuclear system and its further evolution. The reflected wave does not reach space region of the nucleus, it describes reflection outside by Coulomb forces of nucleus. So, it can characterize the potential scattering, without a stage with formation of the compound nuclear system. So, on the basis of this extremely simple scheme, we separate two physically different processes, i.e. (1) the resonant scattering with stage of formation of the compound nuclear system and (2) the potential scattering without the compound nucleus formation. For convenience, we have introduced two new amplitudes T\u22121 and R + 1 , describing propagation and reflection concerning to the studied boundary (bottom index \u201c1\u2019 \u2019 indicates number of boundary, upper index \u201c\u2212\u201d or \u201c+\u201d indicates type of the amplitude concerning to the incident flux, which is directed in the negative or positive radial direction, respectively).\nOn the second step we consider the wave \u03b2 (1) 1 e \u2212ik1r transmitted into the region 1 through the boundary in the previous step. This wave moves to center and is transformed into a new wave which moves in positive direction in this region. We have such a wave function for this process:\n\u03c7(2)(r) = \u03b2 (1) 1 e \u2212ik1r + \u03b1 (2) 1 e ik1r at rmin < r \u2264 r1. (7)\n4 Here, \u03b1 (2) 1 is a new unknown amplitude, which is found from a condition of continuity of the wave function at boundary rmin. At rmin = 0 we have:\n\u03b1 (2) 1 = R0 \u03b2 (1) 1 , R0 = \u22121. (8)\nBut, at rmin \u2265 0 we have\n\u03b1 (2) 1 = R0 \u03b2 (1) 1 , R0 = \u2212e\u22122ik1rmin. (9)\nOn the third step we consider the wave \u03b1 (2) 1 e ik1r which was formed in the previous step and is propagated outside in the region 1. This wave is incident on the boundary at point r1 and is transformed into a new wave which transmitted through the boundary and is moving outside in positive direction in region 2, and a new reflected wave in region 1. We have such a wave function for this process:\n\u03c7(3)(r) =\n{\n\u03b1 (2) 1 e ik1r + \u03b2 (3) 1 e \u2212ik1r at rmin < r \u2264 r1, \u03b1 (3) 2 e ik2r at r1 \u2264 r \u2264 rmax. (10)\nHere, \u03b1 (3) 2 and \u03b2 (3) 1 are two unknown amplitudes. These amplitudes are found from condition of continuity of the full wave function and its derivative at r1:\n\u03b1 (3) 2 = \u03b1 (2) 1 T + 1 = \u03b1 (2) 1 2k1 k + k1 ei(k1\u2212k)r1 , \u03b2 (3) 1 = \u03b1 (2) 1 R + 1 = \u03b1 (2) 1 k1 \u2212 k k + k1 e2ik1r1 , (11)\nwhere\nT+1 = 2k1 k + k1 ei(k1\u2212k)r1 , R+1 = k1 \u2212 k k + k1 e2ik1r1 . (12)\nEach step in such a consideration of propagation of waves is similar to one of the first independent 2N \u2212 1 steps. From the analysis of these steps we obtain recurrent relations for the calculation of the unknown amplitudes \u03b1\n(n) 1 ,\n\u03b2 (n) 1 and \u03b1 (n) 2 for an arbitrary step with number n (here, the logic of the definition of these amplitudes can be found in Appendix A in [17]). In the summation of these relations from each step, we impose the continuity condition for the full (summarized) wave function and its derivative relative to the corresponding boundary.\n2. Summations of amplitudes\nWe calculate summations of all amplitudes of all waves in region 1:\n\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b2 (i) 1 = T \u2212 1\n(\n1 + \u2211\ni=1\n(R0R + 1 )\ni ) = T\u22121\n1\u2212R0R+1 ,\n\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b1 (i) 1 = R0\n\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b2 (i) 1 =\nR0T \u2212 1\n1\u2212 R0R+1 .\n(13)\nSummation of all amplitudes of all outgoing waves in the region 2 outside is\n\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b1 (i) 2 = \u03b1 (1) 2 +\n\u2211\ni=2\n\u03b1 (i) 2 ,\n\u2211\ni=2\n\u03b1 (i) 2 = T \u2212 1 R0T + 1\n(\n1 + \u2211\ni=1\n(R0R + 1 )\ni ) = T\u22121 R0T + 1\n1\u2212R0R+1 .\n(14)\nWe define the following characteristic\nAosc = 1\n1\u2212R0R+1 , (15)\nand we rewrite summations as \u2211\ni=1\n\u03b2 (i) 1 = Aosc T \u2212 1 ,\n\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b1 (i) 1 = R0\n\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b2 (i) 1 = Aosc R0T \u2212 1 ,\n\u2211\ni=2\n\u03b1 (i) 2 = Aosc T \u2212 1 R0T + 1 . (16)\n5 This characteristic describes oscillations of waves inside nuclear region up to barrier maximum (so we call Aosc as amplitude of oscillations). We calculate Aosc (at R0 = \u22121):\nAosc = k + k1\n(k + k1) + (k1 \u2212 k) ei2k1r1 = (k + k1) [(k + k1) + (k1 \u2212 k) e\u2212i2k1r1 ] 2k2(1 \u2212 cos(2k1r1)) + 2k21 (1 + cos(2k1r1)) . (17)\nNow we calculate summations of other amplitudes (at R0 = \u22121): \u2211\ni=1\n\u03b2 (i) 1 = Aosc \u00b7 T\u22121 =\n2k e\u2212i(k\u2212k1)r1\n(k + k1) + (k1 \u2212 k) ei2k1r1 ,\n\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b1 (i) 1 = R0 \u00b7\n\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b2 (i) 1 = \u2212\n2k e\u2212i(k\u2212k1)r1\n(k + k1) + (k1 \u2212 k) ei2k1r1 ,\n\u2211\ni=2\n\u03b1 (i) 2 = Aosc \u00b7 T\u22121 R0T+1 = \u2212 4kk1 (k + k1) + (k1 \u2212 k) ei2k1r1\n1\nk + k1 e2i(k1\u2212k)r1 .\n(18)\nNow we calculated square of modulus of this amplitude Aosc [from Eq. (17)]\n|Aosc|2 = (k + k1)\n2\n2k2(1 \u2212 cos(2k1r1)) + 2k21 (1 + cos(2k1r1)) , (19)\nmodulus of this amplitude\n|Aosc| = k + k1 \u221a\n2k2(1\u2212 cos(2k1r1)) + 2k21 (1 + cos(2k1r1)) . (20)\nAlso we calculate summations of modulus of all amplitudes in the region 1:\n| \u2211\ni=1\n\u03b2 (i) 1 |2 = |\n\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b1 (i) 1 |2 =\n2k2\nk2(1 \u2212 cos(2k1r1)) + k21 (1 + cos(2k1r1)) , (21)\nand summations of amplitudes of all outgoing waves in region 2:\n|\u03b1(1)2 |2 = |R\u22121 |2 = (k \u2212 k1)2 (k + k1)2 , | \u2211\ni=2\n\u03b1 (i) 2 |2 = |Aosc|2 |T\u22121 R0T+1 |2 = 8k2k21 (k + k1)2 [k2(1\u2212 cos(2k1r1)) + k21 (1 + cos(2k1r1))] . (22)\nWe rewrite the final results:\n\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b2 (i) 1 = \u2212\n\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b1 (i) 1 = Aosc \u00b7 T\u22121 =\n2k e\u2212i(k\u2212k1)r1\n(k + k1) + (k1 \u2212 k) ei2k1r1 ,\n\u2211\ni=2\n\u03b1 (i) 2 = Aosc \u00b7 T\u22121 R0T+1 = \u2212 4kk1 (k + k1) + (k1 \u2212 k) ei2k1r1\n1\nk + k1 e2i(k1\u2212k)r1 ,\nAosc = k + k1\n(k + k1) + (k1 \u2212 k) ei2k1r1 = (k + k1) [(k + k1) + (k1 \u2212 k) e\u2212i2k1r1 ] 2k2(1\u2212 cos(2k1r1)) + 2k21 (1 + cos(2k1r1)) ,\n|Aosc| = k + k1 \u221a\n2k2(1\u2212 cos(2k1r1)) + 2k21 (1 + cos(2k1r1)) ,\n(23)\n|Aosc|2 = (k + k1)\n2\n2k2(1\u2212 cos(2k1r1)) + 2k21 (1 + cos(2k1r1)) ,\n| \u2211\ni=1\n\u03b2 (i) 1 |2 = |\n\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b1 (i) 1 |2 = |Aosc|2 |T\u22121 |2 =\n2k2\nk2(1 \u2212 cos(2k1r1)) + k21 (1 + cos(2k1r1)) ,\n|\u03b1(1)2 |2 = |R\u22121 |2 = (k \u2212 k1)2 (k + k1)2 , | \u2211\ni=2\n\u03b1 (i) 2 |2 = |Aosc|2 |T\u22121 R0T+1 |2 = 8k2k21 (k + k1)2 [k2(1\u2212 cos(2k1r1)) + k21 (1 + cos(2k1r1))] .\n(24)\n6 From (24) it follows that Aosc has no zero-points and divergencies. We calculate\nd|Aosc|2 dE = m\nh\u03042kk1\n(k + k1) 2(k1 \u2212 k)\n[k2(1\u2212 cos(2k1r1)) + k21 (1 + cos(2k1r1))]2 \u00d7\n\u00d7 { (k1 \u2212 k) + (k1 + k) cos(2k1r1) + (k + k1) sin(2k1r1) kr1 }\n(25)\nand obtain condition for extremums of the amplitude Aosc(E) (at k1 6= k) k1 \u2212 k + (k1 + k) cos(2k1r1) + kr1 (k1 + k) sin(2k1r1) = 0. (26)\nNote that the incident wave is normalized on unity, but amplitude Aosc can be larger than unity. According to Eq. (24), Aosc can be closer to maximums at cos(2k1r1) = \u00b11:\n{ cos(2k1r1) = +1 } \u2192 { |Aosc|2 = (k + k1)\n2\n4k21 =\n1\n4\n( 1 + k\nk1\n)2\n\u2264 1 } ,\n{ cos(2k1r1) = \u22121 } \u2192 { |Aosc|2 = (k + k1)\n2\n4k2 =\n1\n4\n( 1 + k1 k\n)2\n\u2265 1 } .\n(27)\nEnergies for the second maximums are (at n \u2208 N )\nEmax, n = h\u03042\u03c02 (1 + 2n)2\n8mr21 \u2212 |V1|. (28)\n3. Probability of existence of the compound nuclear system (without fusion)\nLet us find integral from square of modulus of wave function inside internal region:\nr1 \u222b\n0\n|\u03c7(r)|2 dr = r1 \u222b\n0\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2211\ni=1\n\u03b1 (i) 1 e ik1r + \u2211\ni=1\n\u03b2 (i) 1 e\n\u2212ik1r \u2223 \u2223\n\u2223\n2 dr = \u2223 \u2223\n\u2223\n\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b2 (i) 1\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223\n2 r1 \u222b\n0\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 R0 e ik1r + e\u2212ik1r \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 2 dr. (29)\nAt R0 = \u22121 we have r1 \u222b\n0\n|\u03c7(r)|2 dr = 2 \u2223 \u2223\n\u2223\n\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b2 (i) 1\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 2 ( r1 \u2212 sin(2k1r1)\n2k1\n)\n. (30)\nTaking summation \u2211\ni=1\n\u03b2 (i) 1 in Eq. (22) into account, we write\nr1 \u222b\n0\n|\u03c7(r)|2 dr = 2 |Aosc|2 |T\u22121 |2 ( r1 \u2212 sin(2k1r1)\n2k1\n)\n. (31)\nLet us understand physical meaning of the obtained formula. The integral of the square of the wave function over nuclear region determines a probability of existence of a compound nuclear system (within the spatial region from 0 to r1), which can be formed during the scattering of particle on nucleus (denoted as Pcn). One can see that this probability varies with the energy of the incident particle, and reaches maximums at certain values of energy. The amplitude squared of T\u22121 is the penetrability coefficient Tbar, related via an additional factor k1/k2. On this basis, we rewrite the formula above as\nP (without fusion) cn =\nr1 \u222b\n0\n|\u03c7(r)|2 dr = Posc Tbar Ploc, Posc = |Aosc|2, Tbar \u2261 k1 k2 \u2223 \u2223T\u22121 \u2223 \u2223 2 , Ploc = 2 k2 k1 ( r1 \u2212 sin(2k1r1) 2k1 ) .\n(32) So, we have obtained a generalization of idea of Gamow, which is implemented in many papers in calculations of capture cross sections (as well as in similar calculations of half-lives in nuclear decays). However, in addition to the coefficient of penetrability and the factor describing internal oscillations in the spatial region of the nucleus, we have a new coefficient Ploc. It can be associated with the spatial distribution of the wave function of the particle inside the nucleus (it is not related with internal oscillations and the reflectivity of the barrier). In other words, this is a completely new characteristic (and the process corresponding to it), which was not taken into account by Gamow and his followers in determination of half-life for \u03b1-decay. We call it as coefficient of localization.\n7 4. Test via fluxes\nNow we calculate square of modulus of the full summation of all amplitudes \u03b1 (i) 2 and find:\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u03b1 (1) 2 + \u2211\ni=2\n\u03b1 (i) 2 )\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 2 = 1. (33)\nWe conclude that full outgoing flux equals to incident flux from outside in the first step, but it is with opposite direction. We find an interference term between the reflected wave in the first step (describing the potential scattering without stage of the compound nucleus formation) and summation of all other waves propagating outside (which is connected with formation of the compound nucleus):\nPinterf \u2261 2 |\u03b1(1)\u22172 \u00b7 \u2211\ni=2\n\u03b1 (i) 2 )| = 4 \u221a 2 kk1 |k \u2212 k1| (k + k1)2 1 \u221a k2(1\u2212 cos(2k1r1)) + k21 (1 + cos(2k1r1) . (34)\nLet us write this term in a different form, showing explicitly the amplitude of the oscillations. Taking Eq. (23) into account, we have (R0 = \u22121):\nPinterf = 2 |R\u22121 \u00b7 Aosc \u00b7 R0 T\u22121 T+1 | = |Aosc| \u00b7 8kk1 |k \u2212 k1| (k + k1)3 . (35)\nOne can see that the interference term is not a constant, but a function depending on energy of the incident wave. This term has maxima and minima at energies close to (but not equal to) the energies of the maxima and minima of the oscillation amplitude Aosc. The probability of formation of a compound nucleus can be analyzed in terms of this interference term.\n5. Fusion in the internal region\nLet us understand how to include fusion in the processes studied above. From mathematical point of view, one can describe the fusion of an particle with a nucleus in the compound nuclear system, suppressing waves in the internal region of the nuclear system (i.e., region 1). Let us consider the full amplitudes (13) in this region. The complete fusion can be described if to suppress fluxes for each wave in the internal region of the nucleus to zero. This can be realized via the following condition of maximally fast fusion:\nR0 \u2192 0, (36)\nand from Eq. (13) we obtain\n\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b2 (i) 1 = T \u2212 1 ,\n\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b1 (i) 1 = 0. (37)\nLet us calculate summations of the amplitudes going outside into region 2:\n\u2211\ni=2\n\u03b1 (i) 2 =\nT\u22121 R0T + 1 1\u2212R0R+1 = 0, \u2211\ni=1\n\u03b1 (i) 2 = \u03b1 (1) 2 = k \u2212 k1 k + k1 e\u22122ikr1 , (38)\nand amplitude of oscillations\nAosc = 1\n1\u2212R0R+1 = 1. (39)\nIn this case there is potential scattering but no resonant scattering. From Eq. (29) and (36), the probability of the existence of a compound nucleus is\nP (fast fusion) cn =\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2211\ni=1\n\u03b2 (i) 1\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223\n2 r1 \u222b\n0\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 R0 e ik1r + e\u2212ik1r \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 2 dr = \u2223 \u2223T\u22121 \u2223 \u2223 2 r1 = k2 r1 k1 Tbar. (40)\n8 If we want to construct a compound nucleus existed for some period of time without way of fast fusion, we should not suppress completely fluxes in the nuclear region, i.e. it needs to use condition less strict than Eq. (36). We introduce a new factor of fusion p1, redefining the reflection amplitude R0 as\nR (old) 0 \u2192 R0 \u00b7 (1\u2212 p1), 0 \u2264 p1 \u2264 1. (41)\nFor p1 = 1 the formula (41) turns into (36) and we get the fast fusion, while for p1 = 0 we have the compound nuclear system, which decays (as in the elastic scattering).\nB. Potential with barrier of arbitrary shape: Method of multiple internal reflections in description of collision of nuclei (with possibility of fusion)\nLet us consider a process of capture of the particle by the nucleus with the radial barrier of arbitrary shape, which has successfully been approximated by a sufficiently large number N of rectangular steps:\nV (r) =\n\n  \n    V1 at rmin < r \u2264 r1 (region 1), . . . . . . . . . VNcap at rNcap\u22121 \u2264 r \u2264 rcap (region Ncap), . . . . . . . . . VN at rN\u22121 \u2264 r \u2264 rmax (region N),\n(42)\nwhere Vj are constants (j = 1 . . .N). As in the previous section, we denote the first region with a left boundary at point rmin. (we assume rmin \u2264 0). In addition to study in Ref. [12], now we shall assume that the capture of the particle by the nucleus takes place the most probably in region with number Ncapture after its tunneling through the barrier, and further propagation of waves to inside internal region exists and, so, should be studied also. This logic follows from condition of continuity of fluxes in quantum mechanics, that is strict condition, and it will better to include it to analysis also. A general solution of the radial wave function (up to its normalization) for the above barrier energies has the following form:\n\u03c7(r) =\n\n    \n   \n\u03b11 e ik1r + \u03b21 e \u2212ik1r, at rmin < r \u2264 r1 (region 1), \u03b12 e ik2r + \u03b22 e \u2212ik2r, at r1 \u2264 r \u2264 r2 (region 2), . . . . . . . . . \u03b1N\u22121 e ikN\u22121r + \u03b2N\u22121 e \u2212ikN\u22121r, at rN\u22122 \u2264 r \u2264 rN\u22121 (region N \u2212 1), e\u2212ikN r +AR e ikN r, at rN\u22121 \u2264 r \u2264 rmax (region N),\n(43)\nwhere \u03b1j and \u03b2j are unknown amplitudes, AR is unknown amplitude of the full reflection, and kj = 1 h\u0304\n\u221a\n2m(E\u0303 \u2212 Vj) are complex wave numbers. We fix a normalization so that the modulus of amplitude of the starting wave e\u2212ikNr equals unity. We shall search a solution of this problem by the multiple internal reflections approach. The coefficients T\u00b11 . . .T \u00b1 N\u22121 and R \u00b1 1 . . .R \u00b1 N\u22121 can be found from the recurrence relations shown in previous task [17]:\nT+j = 2kj\nkj + kj+1 ei(kj\u2212kj+1)rj , T\u2212j = 2kj+1 kj + kj+1 ei(kj\u2212kj+1)rj ,\nR+j = kj \u2212 kj+1 kj + kj+1 e2ikjrj , R\u2212j = kj+1 \u2212 kj kj + kj+1 e\u22122ikj+1rj .\n(44)\nEach step in such a consideration of packet propagation is similar to one of the first independent 2N \u2212 1 steps. From the analysis of these steps, we find recurrent relations for the calculation of the unknown amplitudes A\n(n) T , A (n) R ,\n\u03b1 (n) j and \u03b2 (n) j for an arbitrary step with number n (here, index j corresponds to the number of region Vj , and the logic of the definition of these amplitudes can be found in Appendix A in [17]). In the summation of these relations from each step, we impose the continuity condition for the full (summarized) wave function and its derivative relative to the corresponding boundary. Now, let us find a wave propagating to the left in region with number j \u2212 1 which is formed after transmission through the boundary at point rj\u22121 of all possible incident waves, produced in result of all possible reflections and transmissions of any waves in the right part of potential from this boundary. Amplitude of this wave can be determined as a summation of amplitudes of all waves incident on boundary at point rj\u22121 multiplied on factor T \u2212 j\u22121. It needs\n9 to take into account that any wave incident on boundary at rj\u22121 can be reflected from this boundary then can be reflected from the boundary at rj and is incident on boundary at rj\u22121 once again. We write\nT\u0303\u2212j\u22121 = T\u0303 \u2212 j T \u2212 j\u22121\n( 1 + +\u221e \u2211\nm=1 (R\u2212j\u22121R\u0303 + j )\nm ) = T\u0303\u2212j T \u2212 j\u22121\n1\u2212R\u2212j\u22121R\u0303+j . (45)\nHere, we use a summarized reflection amplitude R\u0303+j (which should take into account possibility of waves to transfer through boundary at rj , propagate to the right, then after any reflections and transmissions to return back to region with number j) which can be found as\nR\u0303+j\u22121 = R + j\u22121 + T + j\u22121R\u0303 + j T \u2212 j\u22121\n( 1 + +\u221e \u2211\nm=1\n(R\u0303+j R \u2212 j\u22121)\nm ) = R+j\u22121 + T+j\u22121R\u0303 + j T \u2212 j\u22121\n1 \u2212 R\u0303+j R\u2212j\u22121 . (46)\nBy such a way, we have obtained recurrent relations which connect all amplitudes. We choose the following values\nR\u0303+N\u22121 = R + N\u22121, T\u0303 \u2212 N\u22121 = T \u2212 N\u22121, (47)\nas starting point and consequently calculate all amplitudes R\u0303+N\u22122 . . . R\u0303 + Ncap , and T\u0303\u2212N\u22122 . . . T\u0303 \u2212 Ncap . We define summarized amplitude AT of transition through the barrier via all waves transmitted through the potential region with the barrier from rcap to rN\u22121, and so we have\nAT,bar = T\u0303 \u2212 Ncap . (48)\nIn order to find summation of all waves reflected from the boundary at point rj+1 and propagating to the right, we calculate a summarized amplitude of reflection as\nR\u0303\u2212j+1 = R \u2212 j+1 + T \u2212 j+1R\u0303 \u2212 j T + j+1\n( 1 + +\u221e \u2211\nm=1 (R+j+1R\u0303 \u2212 j )\nm ) = R\u2212j+1 + T\u2212j+1R\u0303 \u2212 j T + j+1\n1\u2212R+j+1R\u0303\u2212j . (49)\nOn such a basis, we define amplitude of reflection from the potential region with the barrier from rcap to rN\u22121 as\nAR,bar = R\u0303 \u2212 N\u22121, where R\u0303 \u2212 Ncap = R\u2212Ncap . (50)\n1. Amplitudes of reflection from barrier inside tunneling region and external part of barrier\nWe can also find a summarizing amplitude AR,ext of all waves reflected from the external barrier region (from the external turning point rtp,ext to rN\u22121) and propagated outside (which can characterize a potential scattering) as\nAR,ext = R\u0303 \u2212 N\u22121, where R\u0303 \u2212 Ntp,ext = R\u2212Ntp,ext (51)\nand a summarizing amplitude AR,tun of all waves which are reflected just inside the potential region from rcap to the external turning point rtp,ext [i.e. they are propagated through the external barrier region (without any reflection), tunnels under the barrier, may propagate up to the boundary at point rcap and then are reflected back from this boundary] as\nAR,tun = AR,bar \u2212AR,ps. (52)\nWe estimate amplitude of oscillations Aosc in region of capture with number Ncap as\nAosc(Ncap) = 1\n1\u2212 R\u0303\u2212Ncap\u22121R\u0303 + Ncap\n. (53)\n10\n2. Coefficients of penetrability and reflection concerning to barrier, test\nWe define coefficients of penetrability Tbar and reflection Rbar concerning to the whole barrier (i.e. the potential region from rcap to rN\u22121), and add also definitions for coefficient Rext of reflection from the external part of barrier (i.e. region from rtp,ext to rN\u22121), coefficient Rtun of reflection from the barrier region (i.e. region from rcap to rtp,ext) as\nTbar \u2261 kcap kN \u2223 \u2223AT,bar \u2223 \u2223 2 , Rbar \u2261 \u2223 \u2223AR,bar \u2223 \u2223 2 , Rext \u2261 \u2223 \u2223AR,ext \u2223 \u2223 2 , Rtun \u2261 \u2223 \u2223AR,tun \u2223 \u2223 2 . (54)\nWe check the property\nTbar +Rbar = 1, (55)\nwhich used as text to indicate whether the MIR method gives the proper solution for the wave function.\n3. Summations of amplitudes\nLet us calculate sums of the amplitudes \u03b1 (i) j and \u03b2 (i) j . To determine them, we generalize the formulas (13) for the\nsimplest potential. For the sums of amplitudes for the region with number j, we get\n\u03b2j \u2261 \u2211\ni=1\n\u03b2 (i) j = T\u0303 \u2212 j\n(\n1 + \u2211\ni=1\n(R\u0303j\u22121R\u0303 + j )\ni ) = T\u0303\u2212j\n1\u2212 R\u0303j\u22121R\u0303+j ,\n\u03b1j \u2261 \u2211\ni=1\n\u03b1 (i) j = R\u0303j\u22121\n\u2211\ni=1\n\u03b2 (i) j =\nR\u0303j\u22121T\u0303 \u2212 j\n1\u2212 R\u0303j\u22121R\u0303+1 .\n(56)\n4. Probability of existence of the compound nucleus\nTo determine the probability of the existence of a compound nucleus, we will look for the integral from the square of the wave function over the inner region to the barrier. In this paper we define this region via region between two internal turning points rint,1 and rint,2. In the region of above-barrier energies, we have:\nrint,2 \u222b\nrint,1\n|\u03c7(r)|2dr = nint \u2211\nj=1\nrj \u222b\nrj\u22121\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2211\ni=1\n\u03b1 (i) j e ikjr + \u2211\ni=1\n\u03b2 (i) j e\n\u2212ikjr \u2223 \u2223\n\u2223\n2\ndr =\nnint \u2211\nj=1\n{\n( |\u03b1j |2 + |\u03b2j |2 ) \u2206r + |\u03b1j\u03b2j | kj sin ( \u03b8\u03b1j \u2212 \u03b8\u03b2j + 2kjr ) \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 rj rj\u22121 } ,\n(57) where \u03b8\u03b1j and \u03b8\u03b2j are phases of the amplitudes \u03b1j and \u03b2j , respectively. If the spatial region includes tunneling, then the formulas above should be rewritten in the complex form (where kj are complex numbers):\nrint,max \u222b\n0\n|\u03c7(r)|2 dr = nint,max \u2211\nj=1\nrj \u222b\nrj\u22121\n\u2223 \u2223\u03b1je ikjr + \u03b2je \u2212ikjr \u2223 \u2223 2 dr =\nnint,max \u2211\nj=1\n{\n( |\u03b1j |2 + |\u03b2j |2 ) \u2206r + \u03b1j\u03b2 \u2217 j\n2ikj e2ikjr\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 rj rj\u22121 \u2212 \u03b1\u2217j\u03b2j 2ikj e\u22122ikjr \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 rj rj\u22121 } .\n(58) In this paper we define the probability of the existence of the compound nucleus through the integral (58) over the spatial region between two internal turning points (where the larger internal turning point is determined as the turning point of the barrier for sub-barrier energies, or as coordinate of the barrier maximum for above-barrier energies):\nPcn \u2261 rint,2 \u222b\nrint,1\n|\u03c7(r)|2 dr = nint \u2211\nj=1\n{\n( |\u03b1j |2 + |\u03b2j |2 ) \u2206r + \u03b1j\u03b2 \u2217 j\n2ikj e2ikjr\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 rj rj\u22121 \u2212 \u03b1\u2217j\u03b2j 2ikj e\u22122ikjr \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 rj rj\u22121 } . (59)\nComparing this formula with (32), we see that it is much more complicated. It is not possible to represent it exactly as a simple product of three coefficients of permeability, oscillations and localization.\n11\n5. Cross-section of fusion and coefficients of fusion\nIn description of capture of nuclei by nuclei, there is a standard definition of the fusion cross section \u03c3 based on the barrier penetrability Tbar,l and fusion probabilities Pl (which takes place as soon as nucleus incident on the barrier, has tunneled through this barrier) (for example, see Ref. [15]):\n\u03c3fus(E) =\n+\u221e \u2211\nl=0\n\u03c3l(E), \u03c3l(E) = \u03c0h\u03042\n2mE (2l + 1)Tbar,l(E)Pl, (60)\nwhere \u03c3l is the partial cross-section of fusion at l, E is the energy of the relative motion of the incident nucleus relative to another nucleus. To study the compound nucleus, we introduce a new definition of the partial fusion cross section in terms of the probability of the existence of a compound nucleus (59) as\n\u03c3l = \u03c0h\u03042\n2mE (2l + 1) fl(E)Pcn(E), (61)\nwhere fl(E) is an additional factor that is needed to connect probability Pcn(E), penetrability Tbar,l(E) and the old factor of fusion Pl. To find the explicit form of this coefficient, we consider a case of complete fusion, described by the old formula. A similar result should give a coefficient at coefficients of fusion equal to one. We obtain:\nf(E) = kcap\nkN |rcap \u2212 rtp,in,1| . (62)\nNow, to study formation of the compound nucleus with slow fusion (i.e., without instantaneous fusion), we vary these fusion coefficients in the spatial region between the capture point rcap and the internal second turning point rint,2.\nIII. ANALYSIS\nA. Distance between nuclei in stellar matter\nLet us determine at what distance the nuclei are in the stellar matter, taking the density of the matter into account. We denote the distance between two close nuclei fixed in the lattice as 2R0, and put a \u201cscattering\u201d nucleus between these nuclei (along to Ref. [3], p. 90, Fig. 3.5). The density \u03c10 in the sphere surrounding one nucleus of the lattice can be found as the ratio of mass mA of the nucleus to the volume VA inside this sphere as\n\u03c10 = mA VA = Amu 4/3 \u03c0R30 (63)\nor\nR0 = ( Amu 4/3 \u03c0 \u03c10\n)1/3\n, (64)\nwhere mu is mass of nucleon, A is mass number of nucleus. For pycnonuclear reaction 12C + 12C = 24Mg we can choose estimation of the density, according to Ref. [3] (A = 12)\n\u03c10 = 6 \u00b7 109 g\ncm3 . (65)\nFrom Eq. (64) we find\nR0 = 92.5 fm (66)\nand concentration of nuclei nA is calculated as (\n\u03c10 = Amu \u00b7 nA ) \u2192 ( nA = \u03c10\nAmu\n)\n. (67)\nCalculations give the following result:\nnA = 2.411351533 MeV 3 = 3. 014 189 41 \u00b7 10\u22127 fm\u22123. (68)\n12\nB. Potential of interaction between nuclei\nWe define the potential of interactions between nuclei 12C as\nV (r) = vc(r) + vN (r) + vl=0(r), (69)\nwhere vc(r), vN (r) and vl(r) are Coulomb, nuclear and centrifugal components have the form\nvN (r) = \u2212 VR\n1 + exp\n{ r \u2212RR aR\n} , vl(r) = l (l + 1)\n2mr2 ,\nvc(r) =\n\n \n \nZe2\nr , at r \u2265 Rc,\nZe2\n2Rc\n{\n3\u2212 r 2\nR2c\n}\n, at r < Rc.\n(70)\nHere, VR is strength of nuclear components defined in MeV as\nVR = \u221275.0 MeV, (71)\nRc and RR are Coulomb and nuclear radiuses of di-nuclear system, aR is diffusion parameter. In calculations we use 3\nRR = rR (A 1/3 1 +A 1/3 2 ), Rc = rc (A 1/3 1 +A 1/3 2 ), aR = 0.44 fm, rR = 1.30 fm, rc = 1.30 fm. (72)\nThis potential is shown in Fig. 2. One can see a shape of internal well of the potential (in contract to calculations in\nRef. [3], for example). We find minimum of the internal well and maximum of the barrier as\nrmin = 3.643 fm, Vmin = \u221263.018 MeV, rmax = 8.338 fm, Vmax = +5.972 MeV.\n(73)\n3 Such a potential with parameters was used by us previously for tests in calculations of interaction between nuclear fragments of middle and heavy masses in study of bremsstrahlung emission in fission [24\u201326]. So, it is easy way just to continue formalism and codes in new problem. One can find in literature more accurate formulations of the potential of interactions of these nuclei. For example, in Ref. [21] S factors are computed on the basis of the Sao Paulo potential for a broad range of fusion reactions involving different isotopes (see also more precise method taking into account more physical properties of nuclei in Ref. [22]). However, such formulations include many details related with determination of the potential, which do not take into account analysis of quantum fluxes studied in this paper. So, it is more effective on current stage to describe our quantum method without technical complications of the potential and related computations.\n13\nC. Energy of zero-point vibrations in lattice sites and collision of nuclei\nEnergy of zero-point vibrations of nuclei in lattice sites, which is chosen to study collision between the incident nucleus and the nucleus in lattice, is calculated as\nE0 = h\u0304w\n2 =\nh\u0304 Ze \u221a\nmR30 , \u2206E =\n2Z2e2\nR0 , Efull = E0 +\u2206E. (74)\nFor 12C + 12C = 24Mg we obtain\nE0 = 0.02180806 MeV, \u2206E = 0.56787237 MeV, E (zeromode) full = 0.58968043 MeV. (75)\nFor brevity of analysis, we call such a state (and the corresponding energy) as state in zero mode.\nD. Penetrability of the barrier, rate of reaction and role of new quantum effects\nLet us calculate the penetrability of such a potential barrier using the method of multiple internal reflections (MIR). Fig. 3 shows change of the penetrability depending on the displacement of the point where transition to stage with fusion in the internal nuclear reaction can occur. The calculation is performed at energy E = 0.58 MeV (excess of this\nenergy over the potential is \u2206E = 0.02 MeV at r = R0). In the figure the extreme right part of the line corresponds to the internal (second) turning point, i.e. case when the left part of the region of potential (used in calculation of the penetrability) is restricted by the left boundary of the tunneling region. That corresponds to calculations in the WKB approximation (without taking into account the influence of the external region of potential, which is much smaller), as well as calculations in other approaches. However, fusion process occurs more probably in the nuclear region after some distance from this turning point. This consideration describes more properly the internal quantum fluxes in nucleus. In particular, it improves essentially description of experimental data for related reactions, where a detailed analysis was performed (see Refs. [12, 13], for details, demonstrations, references therein). The difference is\nWKB\u2212 approach : rcap = rtp, 2 = 6.845 fm, T (WKB)bar = 2.255 \u00b7 10\u221232, MIR\u2212 approach : rcap = rmin = 3.643 fm, T (MIR)bar = 1.191 \u00b7 10\u221232. (76)\nUnlike previous approaches, now the penetrability depends on the position of fusion process. One can see that such a shift in the position of the fusion reduces the penetrability by about a factor of two. An accurate estimation gives: T (WKB) bar /T (MIR) bar = 2.255 \u00b7 10\u221232/1.191 \u00b7 10\u221232 =1.893366.\n14\nAccording to Eq. (A14), we calculate reaction rate as\nWnew = k1 h\u0304 m \u00d7 S(E) E \u00d7 T (MIR)bar (rcap) = Wold 1.893366 . (77)\nFor calculation one can take estimation of SCC from Ref. [3] [see p. 95]:\nSCC = 8.83 \u00b7 1016 MeV \u00b7 barn. (78)\nNote that more accurate calculations of the S-factors in dense nuclear matter are made in, for example, Ref. [7] [see Fig. 1 in this paper; see also Refs. [8, 10, 21, 23]]. It also provides convenient formulas for self-analysis for other researchers, and we could move forward that way too. However, to perform the first estimates, S-factors in Eq. (78) and such papers are close enough. Therefore, we will use estimation in Eq. (78) for the S factor in analysis. From Eq. (77) we find\nWold = 1.943542 \u00b7 103 MeV\u22123\nsec , Wnew = 1.026506 \u00b7 103\nMeV\u22123\nsec . (79)\nFrom Eq. (A15) we find number of reactions per second:\nPold = 4.686562 \u00b7 103 1\nsec , Pnew = 2.475266 \u00b7 103\n1\nsec . (80)\nE. Renormalization of wave function\nEstimations of rates of the reactions are strongly depended on how we normalize the wave function. In this topic estimations in unite of volume (usually in cubic centimeters) are used. So, we renormalize our calculations. Following to Ref. [3] [see Eq. (3.7.22), (3.7.25), p. 92], square of modulus of the wave function for incident wave on the barrier is normalized on volume of sphere defined by radius r0 of above-barrier region as\n\u2223 \u2223\u03c7inc \u2223 \u2223 2 =\n1\nr30 \u03c0 3/2\n, r0 = ( h\u0304\n2Ze )1/2 (R30 m )1/4 . (81)\nCalculation gives the following renormalization coefficient\nr0 R0 = 0.13856966, c0 = (R0 r0 )3 \u00b7 1 R30 \u03c0 3/2 = 681.741 719 MeV3, (82)\nand the following renormalized rates and numbers of reactions (denoted by a tilde above)\nW\u0304 =W \u00b7 c0, P\u0304 = P \u00b7 c0. (83)\nFinally, we obtain rate of reaction per second and number of reactions per one cubic centimeter per second as\nW\u0304old = 1324993.664 1\nsec , W\u0304new = 699811.965\n1\nsec ,\nP\u0304old = 2.556019867 1052 sec \u00b7 cm3 , P\u0304new = 1.349993677 1052 sec \u00b7 cm3 . (84)\nF. Resonances and formation of compound nuclear system\nWe will analyze how the coefficients of penetrability and reflection are changed in dependence on the energy of the incident nucleus. Calculation of these characteristics is shown in Fig. 4. One can see that both coefficients are changed monotonically in dependence on the energy. There are no maximums and minimums in such dependencies. This picture is in full agreement with previous studies on the capture of \u03b1 particles by nuclei [12, 13]. Formalism of the method MIR determines also other quantum characteristics. Probability of formation of a compound nucleus calculated by such a way is shown in Fig. 5. Here, resonance maxima are already clearly observed in the probability curve, which correspond to certain quite definite energies. This result gives an entirely new picture for\n15\nprocesses similar to pycnonuclear reactions. These maxima are explained by the need to take into account the further propagation of quantum fluxes in the potential region, in contrast to the existed modern description of pychonuclear reactions, where these fluxes are interrupted and disappeared at internal turning point. Quantum mechanics requires such a consideration, which strictly indicates on continuity of the wave function in the full region of its definition. It requires conservation of fluxes in the full region of definition of the wave function (while calculations of cross-sections and rates of reactions in old approach, for example, T (WKB) bar by Eq. (76), W\u0304old, P\u0304old by Eq. (84), are based on interruption of the quantum flux at turning point). The maxima in the probability curve indicate on some new states in which the compound nucleus is formed and can exist with the maximal probability. Exactly in such states and at such energies the process of further fusion with formation of the new 24Mg nucleus is much more probable, than at energies determined by the theory of pycnonuclear reactions in stars studied else Zel\u2019dovich. The first energies for such resonant maxima are shown in Tabl. I. Let us write down how penetrabilities are different at these two states (rcap = rmin = 3.643 fm):\nE (zeromode) full = 0.58 MeV : T (zeromode) bar = 1.191 \u00b7 10\u221232,\nE (quasi\u2212bound) full = 5.00 MeV : T (quasi\u2212bound) bar = 0.08112.\n(85)\n16\nSo, we find ratio\nT (quasi\u2212bound) bar (Efull = 5.00 MeV)\nT (zeromode) bar (Efull = 0.58 MeV)\n= 0.08112\n1.191 \u00b7 10\u221232 = 6.811 083 123 \u00b7 10 30. (86)\nAccording to Eq. (A15), rate and number of pycnonuclear reactions (per unit time per unit volume), passing through the most probable stage of formation of the compound nucleus will be as many times larger than these characteristics for zero-point vibrations of nuclei in lattice sites. So, essentially more reactions proceed through such stable formations with the nuclei in the lattice. Note that such an effect has not been studied and found yet.\nIV. CONCLUSIONS AND PERSPECTIVES\nA new quantum method for description of pycnonuclear reactions in the compact stars is developed in this paper. The method is based on the formalism of the method of multiple internal reflections, previously developed for study of quantum processes with high precision in the problems of nuclear decays [11, 18\u201320], nuclear captures by nuclei [12, 13], as well as problems of quantum cosmology, where the idea of tunneling is investigated [28]. Main conclusions of the analysis on the example of the reaction 12C+ 12C = 24Mg are the following.\n\u2022 Rates of pycnonuclear reactions are changed essentially, after taking into account nuclear part of the potential of interaction.\n\u2022 A fully quantum analysis reduces rate of reactions and number of reactions by 1.8 times [see Eq. (84)]. This is explained by that the most probable fusion of the nuclei does not occur immediately after leaving nuclear fragment from the tunnel region (the second internal turning point), but at propagation at the middle of the internal potential well.\n\u2022 A fully quantum consideration of the pycnuclear reaction requires a complete analysis of quantum fluxes in the internal region of potential (i.e. in the nuclear system) (quantum mechanics defines wave function inside the full region of its definition, which must be continuous). This leads to the appearance of new states in which formation of a compound nuclear system is the most probable (see Fig. 5, Tabl. I). We call such states as quasi-bound states in pycnonuclear reactions (following to logic and formalism in Refs. [12, 13]). As shown in Fig. 5, at energies corresponding to such states, such a reaction is essentially more probable, than at energies predicted by Zel\u2019dovich [2] and developed by followers of this idea. Therefore, there is a sense to tell about reaction rates for such quasi-bound states, rather than for states of zero-point vibrations in lattice sites. This leads to the essential changes in estimation of the rates of pycnonuclear reactions in stars [see Eq. (86)]. These states of nuclei 12C are not included to systematic description [29]. There is interesting perspective to test the method presented in this paper on the basis of new experimental measurements in Ref. [30].\n17\nAcknowledgements\nS. P.

Rates of reactions and fusion probabilities\nIn pycnonuclear reactions, some additional characteristics are determined. We follow formalism in Ref. [3] [see p. 86\u201394 in that book]. The reaction rate (probability per second) in scattering of one nucleus with charge Z1 on another nucleus with charge Z2 is\nW = (transmitted flux at Rn)\u00d7 4 \u03c0R2n \u00d7 Pn = = (incident flux ) \u00d7 Tfull \u00d7 4 \u03c0R2n \u00d7 Pn.\n(A1)\nHere Pn is the probability of nuclear reaction, starting from moment when incident nucleus has already penetrated the barrier into the inner region of the other nucleus; Tfull is coefficient of penetrability of the barrier. The reaction rate is determined using the reaction cross section \u03c3 as\nW = \u03c3(E) \u00d7 (incident flux). (A2)\nHere, E is energy of scattering of nucleus on the other nucleus. Fhe following formula of cross-section of reaction is used traditionally in this topic (for example, see Ref. [3], Eq. (3.7.15), p. 90):\n\u03c3(E) = S(E)\nE \u00d7 Tfull, (A3)\nthat gives\nW = 4\u03c0R2n PnE\nE \u00d7 Tfull \u00d7 (incident flux) =\nS(E)\nE \u00d7 Tfull \u00d7 (incident flux),\nS(E) = 4\u03c0R2n PnE,\n(A4)\nNow we repeat these calculations, but on the basis of method of multiple internal reflections described above. Previously cross-section (probability) for formation of a compound nucleus in the scattering of the \u03b1 particles on nuclei was determined [it can be associated with the processes of capture of \u03b1 particles by nuclei] on the basis of the barrier penetrability Tbar,l and probabilities of fusion Pl (which takes place as soon as projectile has tunneled through the barrier):\n\u03c3fus(E) = +\u221e \u2211\nl=0\n\u03c3l(E), \u03c3l(E) = \u03c0h\u03042\n2mE (2l + 1) fl(E)Pcn(E), (A5)\nwhere [see Eq. (32)]\nPcn = Posc Tbar Ploc, Posc = |Aosc|2 = (k + k1) 2\n2k2(1\u2212 cos(2k1r1)) + 2k21 (1 + cos(2k1r1)) ,\nTbar \u2261 k1 k2 \u2223 \u2223T\u22121 \u2223 \u2223 2 , Ploc = 2 k2 k1 ( r1 \u2212 sin(2k1r1) 2k1 ) .\n(A6)\nHere, \u03c3l is the partial cross-section of capture at l, Tbar is the barrier penetrability (concerning to the strictly chosen coordinate of fusion, without oscillations).\n18\nOne can use fl(E)Pcn instead of Tfull (Tfull \u2192 fl(E) \u00b7 Pcn). From Eq. (A4) and (A5) we write (we use l = 0, following to Ref. [3])\nW = S(E)\nE \u00d7 fl(E)Pcn \u00d7 (incident flux), S(E) =\n\u03c0h\u03042 2m (2l+ 1). (A7)\nHere, fl(E) is an additional coefficient that is needed to connect probability Pcn(E), penetrability Tbar,l(E) and the old factor Pl. To find explicit value of this coefficient, we consider a case of fast complete fusion, described by the old formula. A similar result gives the coefficient of fusion to be equal to unite. We get:\nf(E) = kcap\nkN |rcap \u2212 rtp,in,1| . (A8)\nLet us calculate this coefficient for the potential of a simple form shown in Fig. 1:\nf (simple)(E) = k1 k2 r1 , (A9)\nwhere\nkcap = k1, kN = k2, rcap = r1, rtp,in,1 = 0. (A10)\n2. Quantum flux and number of pycno-nuclear reactions\nTo find flux, we use its definition in quantum mechanics. According to Ref. [14] (see Eq. (19.4), p. 80 in this book), we define the flux as\nj (r) = i h\u0304\n2m (\u03d5\u2207\u03d5\u2217 \u2212 \u03d5\u2217\u2207\u03d5). (A11)\nThen, for the incident flux (i.e. the flux for the incident wave in the form of exp(\u2212ik1r)) we have (r > r1)\njinc (r) = i h\u0304\n2m\n[ exp(\u2212ik1r) d\ndr exp(\u2212ik1r)\u2217 \u2212 exp(\u2212ik1r)\u2217\nd\ndr exp(\u2212ik1r)\n] = \u2212k1 h\u0304 m . (A12)\nWe write formula for the reaction rate as\nW = k1 h\u0304 m \u00d7 \u03c0h\u0304\n2\n2mE (2l + 1) fl(E)Pcn(E)\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 l=0 = k1 h\u0304 m \u00d7 S(E) E \u00d7 fl(E)Pcn. (A13)\nHere, there are formulas in the old and new definitions:\nWold = k1 h\u0304 m \u00d7 S(E) E \u00d7 Tbar,\nWnew = k1 h\u0304 m \u00d7 S(E) E \u00d7 fl(E)Pcn, P (fast fusion)cn = Tbar \u00d7 Posc Ploc.\n(A14)\nWe determine number of reactions per cubic centimeter per second, following formalism in Ref. [3] [see p. 94, Eq. (3.7.38) in that book]:\nP0 = nAW, (A15)\nwhere nA is concentration of nuclei (in crystal lattice), it is estimated under assumption that one nucleus is in the sphere with radius R0/2. For analysis we will choose reaction of 12C + 12C = 24Mg [16]. Different estimations of density were obtained for such a reaction (for example, see Ref. [3], p. 83). Hamada and Salpeter estimated that 12C would be converted to 24Mg via pycnonuclear reactions above a density of 6 \u00b7109 g \u00b7cm\u22123 [27], that was based on estimations of pycnonuclear reaction rates calculated by Cameron [1]. Those estimations then were improved (for example, see calculations by Salpeter and Van Horn [4], etc.). However, the densities quoted here are still quite uncertain. Besides the difficulty of an accurate calculation, finite temperatures and crystal imperfections can increase the rates significantly (the critical density for carbon can be about 5 \u00b7 1010 g \u00b7 cm\u22123). But, difference in such estimations is not principal for our analysis,\n19\nso we will choose the density above given by Hamada and Salpeter for calculations. We will show below that quantum corrections change results essentially also.\n[1] A. G. W. Cameron, Pycnonuclear reactions and nova explosions, Astrophys. J. 130, 916 (1959). [2] Ya. B.
