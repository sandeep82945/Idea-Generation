The MgB3C3 is energetically and dynamically stable at ambient pressure in the P-62m hexagonal structure with c/a \u2248 0.79 and forms in stacks of honeycomb B-C layers with Mg as a space filler. Band structure calculations indicate that the bands at the Fermi level derive mainly from B and C orbitals in which two \u03c3- and two \u03c0 bands both contribute to the total density of state. The \u03c0 bands are found to be strongly couple with out-of-plane acoustic phonon mode, while the \u03c3 bands coupled with the in-plane bond-stretching optical E\u2032 phonon modes produces a sizable superconductivity in MgB3C3.\nKeywords: Superconductivity, MgB2, electron-phonon coupling, crystal structure prediction\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe discovery of the superconductor MgB2 with a remarkably high superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of around 39 K has led to significant interest in studying the superconducting properties of graphite intercalation compounds at ambient pressure [1\u2013 3]. The mechanism behind the superconductivity of layered MgB2-related compounds is thought to be the strong coupling between electrons in pxy orbitals (\u03c3 bands) and the ultrafast phonon dynamics of the in-plane vibration of honeycomb layers, specifically the E2g stretching mode in MgB2 [4, 5]. In contrast, the electron-phonon interaction is weaker in pz orbitals (\u03c0 bands) and contributes less to the electron-phonon coupling strength (\u03bb) [1, 6]. There have been many efforts in recent years to increase the Tc of MgB2 or to find new graphite intercalation compounds because these materials are still the best candidates for ambient pressure superconductors [7\u20139]. These efforts have focused on increasing the electronic density of states (DOS) at the Fermi level, and therefore the electron-phonon coupling, through chemical doping at the Mg or B sites, hydrogenation, or tensile strain. [10\u201312]. One promising approach to finding new superconducting compounds involves replacing 50% of the B atoms with C to form B-C honeycomb layers, resulting in compounds such as MgBC, LiBC, Mg2B4C2, Li2B3C, etc. [2, 3, 7, 13]. Theoretical model calculations have suggested that the critical temperature (Tc) could reach 100 K in hole-doped LixBC (x = 0.5) [14]. However, creating Li vacancies to dope the material with holes also produces local lattice distortion, which significantly changes the band structure, phonon vibrations, and electron-phonon interaction and ultimately destroys the superconductiv-\n\u2217 nguyenduclong@vlu.edu.vn\nity in Li0.5BC. [15]. While it has been proposed that boosting the critical temperature (Tc) by introducing Li deficiencies without causing lattice distortion is impractical [16], it is possible to select a unit cell containing a reduced number of Li (or Mg) atoms in practice. This has been a challenge for the past 20 years since the suggestion that metal deficiency could enhance the superconductivity of MB2-like compounds (M: metal). In this work, we introduce a high-Tc superconductor, MgB3C3, by reducing the number of Mg atoms by two-thirds (about 67%) in MgB2 while maintaining the periodic crystal structure without lattice distortion. Using a combination of first-principles calculations and isotropic Eliashberg theory, we show that the electron-phonon coupling between electrons from the \u03c3 bands and the bond-stretching optical E\u2032 phonon modes at around 20.3 THz (677 cm\u22121, 83 meV) is strengthened in MgB3C3. The interaction of electrons in the \u03c0 bands with the out-of-plane acoustic modes of the B-C lattice also contributes to an increase in \u03bb up to 1.1, resulting in a maximum Tc of 59 K using the same parameters calculated for MgB2 (38 K)."

The generalized gradient approximation (GGA) in the form of Perdew-BurkeErnzerhof(PBE) exchange and correlation functional [22] and the standard solid-state pseudopotentials library [23] for pseudopotentials were used. The plane-wave basis set energy cutoff and charge density cutoff were set to 45 Ry and 360 Ry, respectively.

The phonon dispersion and the electron-phonon coupling constants are calculated based on density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) [25] and Eliashberg equations [26] with a 6\u00d76\u00d76 q -point grid. We employed linear interpolation to interpolate the electron-phonon coupling matrix to a denser grid of 36\u00d736\u00d736 in order to obtain a converged result[27]. To calculate the critical temperature, Tc, of MgB3C3, we also used the OptB88-vdW exchange-correlation functionals [28]with van der Waals (vdW) correction. This method has been commonly used for the structural optimization of van der Waals layered materials and has been found to have better agreement with experimental results. An evolutionary algorithm was used to find the crystal structure of MgB3C3 as implemented in the Cryspy package [29]. This algorithm works by starting with a population of structures and evolving them through a process of \u201dsurvival of the fittest,\u201d in which structures with lower energy become the parents of a new generation of structures [30]. We used tournament selection and roulette selection to select the parent structures from the population of surviving parents. To produce offspring from the parents, we used evolutionary operations such as crossover, permutation, and strain, which were set to 10, 3, and 5, respectively. The new generation of structures included not only those produced by these evolutionary operations, but also random structures and structures chosen through elite selection throughout 30 generations. We included two new random structures and two elite selection structures in each generation. The result of crystal structure prediction is shown in Fig. S1 Supplementation information."

            "heading": "III. MAIN RESULTS AND DISCUSSION",
            "text": "The crystal structure of MgB3C3 is shown in Fig.1. It can be seen that MgB3C3 belongs to a class of graphite intercalation compounds, with the B-C lattice forming stacks of honeycomb layers and Mg as a spacer. The\nMg atoms are located at the 1b (0,0,0.5) Wyckoff position, while the B and C atoms occupy the 3f (x,0,0) position, with x values of 0.65846 and 0.32597 for B and C, respectively. The formation energy of MgB3C3 is calculated to be 0.0038 eV/atom, which is a positive value but small enough to be potentially achievable in experiments. In contrast to the crystal structure of MgB2 (Figure 1b), the number of Mg atoms is critically reduced to one-third (about 33%), corresponding to a deficiency of two-thirds (about 67%) of the Mg atoms in MgB2 (or MgBC)[3]. It is worth noting that the Mg deficiencies in MgB3C3 are much higher than the 50% Li deficiencies in LiBC[14]. Despite this, the lattice structure of MgB3C3 maintains a non-distorted configuration with uniform honeycomb B-C layers, as shown in Figure 1(a). The bond length between B and C is around 1.55 A\u030a and 1.56 A\u030a, which is smaller than the 1.77 A\u030a bond length in the B-B honeycomb of MgB2. This nonuniformity in bond length appears to be a characteristic feature of BC layers [8], which would increase a degree of freedom in the phonon vibrations of lattice. In addition, a shorter bond length also leads to better orbital overlap between B and C atoms, resulting in stronger \u03c0 and \u03c3 bands that couple more strongly with phonon vibrations. High electron localization function (ELF) values above 0.9 (see Fig. 1(c)) near the center of the bonds suggest the presence of strong covalent bonding throughout the B-C ring in MgB3C3. The spacing between two adjacent honeycomb B-C layers is about 3.73 A\u030a, which is slightly higher than that of 3.5 A\u030a for Mg2B4C2, 3.53 A\u030a for MgB2, and 3.38 A\u030a for Li4B5C3 [2, 13]. The unit cell of MgB3C3 with a hexagonal structure (space group P-62m) is shown as thin lines in 1(a), with lattice constants of a = 4.69 A\u030a and c = 3.73 A\u030a. Most MgB2-like superconducting compounds have a hexagonal unit cell with a c/a ratio greater than 1, so the c/a ratio of approximately 0.79 in MgB3C3 is unusual. Therefore, the electronic band structure is expected to be significantly different from previous reports.\nThe electronic band structure, electronic densities of states, and Fermi surfaces of MgB3C3 are thus shown in Fig.2.

The \u03c3- and \u03c0 bands crossing the Fermi level are indicated (b1)-(b4) Fermi surfaces corresponding to the four bands labeled in (a).\nture of MgB3C3 within 5 eV of the Fermi level are illustrated here as the most significant feature of the material. The high-energy portion of the valence band in MgB3C3 consists of two \u03c0 bands and two \u03c3 bands that cross the Fermi level and create a small indirect gap of 0.487 eV between the valence and conduction bands. This type of gap between the \u03c3-bonding and \u03c3\u2217-antibonding bands is not commonly observed in MgB2-related compounds, with the exception of LiB2C2 trilayer [1]. The \u03c0 bands in MgB3C3 exhibit a nearly flat band along the \u0393-A direction of the Brillouin zone, similar to MgB2, but these bands are almost completely filled, with their maximum energies just above the Fermi level by about 0.05 eV, and they incline from the \u0393 to A points. These bands give rise to a small hole pocket and a spindle-shaped hole Fermi surfaces, as shown in 2(b1) and (b2). The two \u03c3 bands of MgB3C3, which cross the Fermi level, have a relative energy that is similar to that of the two \u03c0 bands throughout the Brillouin zone.The Fermi surface of the two \u03c3 bands is shown in 2(b3) and (b4). It has been previously shown that the lowering of the \u03c3 bands relative to the \u03c0 bands leads to a \u03c0 \u2192 \u03c3 charge transfer and \u03c0-band hole doping effect, which is believed to be the driving force behind the superconductivity in MgB2 [31, 32]. We would like to emphasize that the lowering of the \u03c3 bands is due to the transfer of charge from valence electrons in Mg 3s to B 2pz orbitals, which causes a slight incline in the flat band along the \u0393-A direction [33, 34]. In MgB3C3, the \u03c3- and \u03c0 bands have comparable energy levels with multiple crossover points, so the transfer of charge from Mg to the B-C lattices and the transition from \u03c0 to \u03c3 bands may also be beneficial for structural stability and\nG G\n(a)\nB1\nC1\nB2\nB3\nC2\nC3\nC1B1\nC2 B2\nC3 B3\ntotal Mg B C\nD O\nS\na (w\n) 2 F 0 .6\n0 .3\n0 .9\n3 .5\n1 .7\n5\nl (w\n)\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35\nFrequency (THz)\n0 5 10 15 20 25 30 35\nFrequency (THz)\n(b)\n(c) (d)\nb1\nb2\nFIG. 3.

The Bader charge analysis shows that Mg donates an average of 1.6E\u2212e to the B-C ring. It is worth noting that the \u03c3 bands also contribute to the lower energy bands (below -2 eV). The \u03c3 (or \u03c0) bands of the valence band have a higher occupancy in the 2pz orbital (or pxy orbital) of C atoms compared to that of B atoms, as seen in the density of states profile. However, the occupancy of the 2pz orbital of C atoms is smaller in the conduction band. On the other hand, the weighted occupancy of Mg s orbitals almost disappears near the Fermi level, but it is present at higher and lower energy levels (see Fig. S2 of Supplementation information); This indicates that there is a charge transfer from Mg to the B-C layers [7]. The substantial weight of Mg atoms in the density of states (DOS) profile is mainly due to the 2p orbitals. The total DOS at the Fermi level is around 1.9 states/eV, mostly from the contribution of the \u03c0- and \u03c3 bands of C (68%) and B (26%). In contrast, Mg atoms only contribute 6% to the DOS. It is worth noting that MgB3C3 has a higher DOS at the Fermi level compared to MgB2 and related compounds [1, 6, 11].\nNext, we will discuss the lattice dynamics and electronphonon coupling (EPC) of MgB3C3. Using density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) [25], we can calculate the phonon frequencies by diagonalizing the dynamical matrix, and the electron-phonon coefficients g can be obtained from the first-order derivative of the self-consistent\n4 Kohn-Sham (KS) potential:\ngq\u03bd(k, i, j) =\n( ~\n2M\u03c9q\u03bd\n)1/2 \u3008\u03c8i,k|\ndVSCF du\u0302q\u03bd \u00b7 \u0302q\u03bd |\u03c8j,k+q\u3009.\n(1) where M represents the atomic mass, q and k are wave vectors, and ij and \u03bd refer to indices of electronic energy bands and phonon modes, respectively. The phonon linewidth \u03b3q\u03bd is defined by\n\u03b3q\u03bd = 2\u03c0\u03c9q\u03bd \u2211 ij \u222b d3k \u2126BZ |gq\u03bd(k, i, j)|2\n\u03b4(eq,i \u2212 eF )\u03b4(ek+q,j \u2212 eF ), (2)\nThe EPC constant, \u03bbq\u03bd , for mode \u03bd at wavevector q is defined as\n\u03bbq\u03bd = \u03b3q\u03bd\n\u03c0~N(eF )\u03c92q\u03bd (3)\nFig. 3 shows the phonon dispersions, phonon DOS, Eliashberg spectral functions \u03b12F (\u03c9), electron-phonon coupling strengths \u03bb(\u03c9), and the representative phonon vibrations for double degenerate E\u2032 mode. The phonon dispersions in Fig. 3(a) show no imaginary phonon modes, suggesting that MgB3C3 is dynamically stable at ambient pressure. Five low-lying optical modes exist at the zone center \u0393, two of which are degenerate modes at frequencies of 6.76 and 10.46, and one at 11.2 THz. These modes involve the in-plane and out-of-plane vibrations with governing contribution of Mg and C atoms to the phonon DOS, as seen in Fig. 3(c). We have observed that the double degenerate mode E\u2032\u2032 at 10.46 THz corresponds to a specific out-of-plane vibration of the C atoms. The other optical modes located at 15.1, 20.3, 21.6, 23.4, 23.6, 27.9, 29.0, 31.7, and 34.3 THz at the zone center \u0393 are solely attributed to vibrations of the B-C lattice. All of these optical modes are found to be quite dispersive, with the exception of those along the \u0393-A direction, which reflects the layered structure of MgB3C3. Among these phonon modes, the double degenerate mode at 20.3 THz (677 cm\u22121, 83 meV) is of particular interest when it has a sizable coupling with electrons at the Fermi level (denoted by red circles in Fig. 3(a)), which is similar to the E2g mode in MgB2 [35]. This mode involves the degenerate in-plane bondstretching E\u2032 modes along the \u0393-A direction, which are shown in figure 3(b1) and (b2). The arrows and ellipse in the figure indicate the movement of the atoms: the lower frequency mode involves the rotation of an ellipse and the backward and forward movement of the B and C atoms, while the higher frequency mode only involves the back and forth movement. These E\u2032 modes are very anharmonic which evident of a large phonon linewidth and can achieve a significantly large effective population due to their ultrafast phonon dynamics [4]. We observed that the vibration frequency of the in-plane bond-stretching E\u2032 mode in MgB3C3 is much higher than in MgB2 (74.5 meV), but similar to that in monolayer LiBC (86.5 meV)\n[7] and LiB2C2 trilayer film (87.7 meV)[1]. We want to emphasize that, although the in-plane bond-stretching E\u2019 mode does not contribute significantly to the phonon density of states compared to other modes, its strong coupling with electrons near the Fermi level produces a very intense peak in the Eliashberg spectral function (defined as \u03b12F (\u03c9) = 12\u03c0N(eF ) \u2211 q\u03bd \u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9q\u03bd) \u03b3q\u03bd ~\u03c9q\u03bd .), as seen in 3(d). Three acoustic modes make a major contribution to the Eliashberg spectral function in the low frequency range (less than 10.8 THz), accounting for nearly 48% of the total electron-phonon coupling\n\u03bb = \u2211 q\u03bd \u03bbq\u03bd = 2 \u222b \u03b12F (\u03c9) \u03c9 d\u03c9.. A sizable contribution of low-frequency phonon modes to the \u03bb(\u03c9) is in good agreement with previous reports [1, 4, 7]. The acoustic phonon-mediated superconductivity also reports previously in MBC (M = Ba, Sr, etc.) [3]. In MgB3C3, the Mg atoms have a significant presence in the phonon density of states at low frequencies, but their in-plane vibrations have less impact on \u03b12F (\u03c9) and \u03bb(\u03c9) due to weak orbital overlap between Mg atoms. Instead, the low-frequency spectra weight in \u03b12F (\u03c9) and \u03bb(\u03c9) is mainly due to the out-of-plane displacement of B and C atoms, indicating important coupling between the \u03c0 bands and lowfrequency modes. This is not the case in MgB2, where the high-frequency (87.1 meV) out-of-plane vibration of boron honeycomb layers (B1g mode) has less impact on \u03b12F (\u03c9) and \u03bb(\u03c9) [36]. It has been observed that the coupling between electron \u03c0 bands and acoustic phonons is enhanced in honeycomb B-C lattices, as well as between \u03c0 bands and the out-of-plane vibration of B-C lattices in the optical branch (specifically, the modes at 15.1 and 21.6 THz of the E\u2032 point). This contributes to \u03b12F (\u03c9) and \u03bb(\u03c9), as shown in Figure 3(d). The out-of-plane vibration of B atoms in the frequency range of 15-20 THz contributes approximately 12% to \u03bb(\u03c9), while other optical modes above 20 THz contribute about 40%. The total electron-phonon coupling constant is approximately 1.1, which is about 25% larger than that of MgB2.\nWe then obtained the superconducting parameters of MgB3C3 as summarized in Tab.I. For comparison, we also calculated the same parameters for MgB2 using a similar DFPT setup. It is known that using different exchange correlation functionals can lead to different results, so we also used the vanderWall correction functional OptB88-vdW to estimate the Allen-Dynes-modified McMillan formula Tc = \u03c9log 1.2 exp [ \u22121.04(1+\u03bb) \u03bb(1\u22120.62\u00b5\u2217)\u2212\u00b5\u2217 ] for both cases. This functional has been shown to provide better agreement with experimental results for MgB2, even without solving the anisotropic Eliashberg equations [37]. Although McMillan formula relies on the semi-empirical parameter of Coulomb repulsion (\u00b5\u2217), the predictive power of this approach remains significant. We obtained a superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of 45.3 K using the commonly used value of \u00b5\u2217=0.1, which is double the value obtained for MgB2 using the same parameter. It is worth noting that the calculated value of \u03bb for MgB2 is in good\n5\nagreement with previous theoretical studies [37\u201339] and experiments [40]. The OptB88-vdW functional resulted in a higher value of \u03bb for both MgB2 and MgB3C3. As a result, the critical temperature (Tc) of MgB2 was calculated to be 27.4 K with a value of \u00b5\u2217 = 0.1, but to match the experimental value, a value of \u00b5\u2217 = 0.05 is needed. On the other hand, the very same value resulted in a Tc of 59.2 K for MgB3C3. Based on this numerical analysis, it can be concluded that MgB3C3 may be a superior superconductor compared to MgB2 due to its unique crystal structure, electronic structure, and the electron-phonon coupling nature."
