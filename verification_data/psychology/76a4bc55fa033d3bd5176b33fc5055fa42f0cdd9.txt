Based on the provided text, the following sentences/portion of text mention future research directions:

1. "However, the mechanism of transformation and formation of IBPs is not yet fully understood."
2. "Moreover, due to the high extraction temperature, thermosensitive compounds (e.g., anthocyanins) could be degraded."
3. "However, this is a complex process that requires well-defined conditions to ensure a good recovery."
4. "Moreover, this process must be conducted in the dark under a nitrogen/argon atmosphere for 1â€“4 h to prevent oxidation."
5. "Additionally, foods with high proteins may precipitate under strong basic conditions; hence, a neutral or acidic pH is essential."
6. "Moreover, this is a time-saving method along with the higher extraction efficiency of IBPs, though a high cost is always linked with the enzymatic procedures."
7. "The bioavailability of IBPs is mostly very low, which is mainly linked to the structure of the food matrix which severely delays the hydrolysis of IBPs, causing low bioaccessibility."

These sentences suggest areas within the study of insoluble-bound phenolics (IBPs) that require further investigation or present challenges that future research could address.
