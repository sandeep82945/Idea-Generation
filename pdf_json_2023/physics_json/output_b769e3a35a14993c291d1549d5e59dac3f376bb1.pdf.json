Metabolized ethanol reduces NAD+ to NADH, affecting critical metabolic pathways. Here, our aim was to investigate whether alcohol is metabolized by bone marrow cells and if it impacts the metabolic pathways of leukocyte progenitor cells. This is said to lead to a qualitative and quantitative alteration of key metabolites which may be related to the immune response.\nMethods: We addressed this aim by using C57BL/6 mice under chronic ethanol administration and evaluating themetabolomic profile of bonemarrow total cells by gas chromatography\u2013coupled mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS).\nResults: We identified 19 metabolites. Our data demonstrated that chronic ethanol administration alters the metabolomic profile in the bone marrow, resulting in a statistically diminished abundance of five metabolites in ethanoltreated animals: uracil, succinate, proline, nicotinamide, and tyrosine.\nDiscussion: Our results demonstrate for the first time in the literature the effects of alcohol consumption on the metabolome content of hematopoietic tissue and open a wide range of further studies to investigate mechanisms by which alcohol compromises the cellular function of the immune system.\nKEYWORDS\nalcoholism, bone marrow, metabolome, cell function, metabolites, immune system\nfrontiersin.org01"

            "text": "Alcohol use disorder (AUD) is characterized by an impaired ability to stop or control alcohol use, despite adverse social, occupational, or health consequences. AUD is one of the most common psychiatric disorders and is a leading cause of mortality worldwide (1).\nConsiderable evidence indicates that alcohol abuse results in clinical abnormalities of the immune system (2, 3). Hematopoietic stem cells differentiate into myeloid progenitor cells, which are the precursor cells of granulocytes, the major type of phagocyte, constituting the front line of innate immune defense (4, 5).\nMultiple lines of clinical and experimental evidence demonstrate that chronic alcohol consumption is linked to increased risks of infections, such as pneumonia. This effect has been related to alcohol\u2019s effect on the immune system (6, 7), such as alterations in the production of bone marrow immune cells and impairment of their effector functions (3, 5).\nAlthough there is a vast literature describing the effect of alcohol on the immune system (2, 3), there is a limitation in our understanding of the effect of alcohol on the bone marrow, and it is not known whether the cells of this system are affected by alcohol in the bloodstream or if this deleterious effect occurs inside the bone marrow microenvironment.\nThe majority of ingested alcohol is metabolized in the liver by hepatocytes, but immune cells such as macrophages and neutrophils can also metabolize it (8). Regardless of cell type, alcohol metabolism involves the action of alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2). The ADH enzyme is present in the cytoplasm of cells and is responsible for the oxidation reaction of ethanol that results in acetaldehyde. ADH2 is present in the mitochondria and converts acetaldehyde to acetate. These reactions involve the reduction of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) to NADH, increasing the NADH : NAD+ ratio, and leading to a cellular environment vulnerable to damages caused by metabolites and adducts from ethanol metabolism and reactive oxygen species (ROS) (9).\nThe NADH : NAD+ ratio is an important parameter for the maintenance of several metabolic enzymes, and its disbalance is known to disturb cell metabolism (10), such as decreased glycolysis (11), decreased Krebs cycle (12, 13), and decreased gluconeogenesis (13, 14).\nImmune cells have distinct metabolic configurations that allow them to balance energy demands and molecular biosynthesis. However, beyond that, it is now becoming clear that cellular metabolism has direct roles in regulating immune cell function, and disturbances in these metabolic configurations limit the functionality of these cel ls (15\u201317). The field of immunometabolism has advanced our understanding of how cell metabolism plays a central role in cell function, such as phagocytosis, ROS production, cell differentiation/maturation, and consequent host defenses (18\u201320).\nIn this study, we applied a metabolomic approach using gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) to characterize metabolic changes in the bone marrow microenvironment to test the hypothesis that alcohol could change metabolic pathways in the bone marrow and leukocyte progenitor cells, leading to a qualitative\nFrontiers in Immunology 02\nand quantitative alteration of metabolites that may be directly or indirectly related to the immune response.\nWe obtained a snapshot of the distinct changes in the metabolite composition of bone marrow cellular content in mice chronically exposed to ethanol. The identified metabolites suggest that chronic alcohol consumption would disrupt several metabolic pathways, such as glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and amino acid synthesis, that could interfere with immune cell function.\nOur results represent the first step toward understanding the dysfunction of the immune system due to alcohol consumption because of bone marrow microenvironment alteration of metabolite content."

Samples were analyzed randomly, and QCs were analyzed at the beginning, every five samples, and at the end of the analytical sequence.\nFor the construction of the identification library, data were corrected for the retention times of hydrocarbon patterns (FAME MIX). Metabolites detected in the blank were removed from the final result.\nThe analyses were performed in a gas chromatography system (model 5975C, Agilent Technologies) coupled to a quadrupole mass spectrometer (model 7890A, Agilent Technol). A HP5-MS column (30 m, 0.25 i.d., 0.25 mm film, 95% dimethyl/5% diphenylpolysiloxane\u2014Agilent Technologies) was used to perform the separation of the metabolites. High-purity helium was used as a mobile phase at a 1 ml/min flow rate. The injector was maintained at 250\u00b0C, and samples were injected with a 1:10 split at 10 ml/min of He. The oven was initially set at 60\u00b0C and held for 1 min, and the temperature increased to 300\u00b0C at 10\u00b0C/min, resulting in 25 min of run time.\nThe MS was operated in scan mode (50\u2013600 m/z). An electron impact ionization source was placed at \u221270 eV. Detector transfer line, source filament, and quadrupole temperatures are maintained at 290, 230, and 150\u00b0C, respectively.

            "heading": "4 Discussion",
            "text": "Metabolic profiles have been explored in many diseases (23),\nincluding liver diseases resulting from alcoholism (24\u201327). This study was the first to investigate the impact of chronic alcohol consumption on the bone marrow metabolic profile using an in vivo model of chronic ethanol consumption. The motivation for this study stems from evidence demonstrating that chronic consumption has negative effects on the ability of individuals with hazardous alcohol use to respond properly during infections (2, 28, 29).\nAnalytical tools for metabolomics studies have high sensitivity, being able to identify and quantify the presence of analytes at low concentrations (30). Therefore, the first step of the present study was to evaluate, by flow cytometry, whether the parameter number of cells would be adequate, since alcohol could be causing an increase in cell size, resulting in a bias toward greater abundance of the metabolite. The descriptive evaluation obtained from the FSC, and SSC histograms showed that ethanol treatment does not cause changes in the size/volume of cells in the bone marrow, ensuring that the quantitative differences found in this study are because of alcohol on metabolic pathways, resulting in a distinct metabolic profile.\nThe negative effect of chronic ethanol consumption on the immune system and bone marrow has already been investigated. It is well established that the cells of the immune system of individuals affected by alcoholism have a lower capacity to migrate to the infectious site, phagocyte, and eliminate the pathogen, and the mechanism is often related to the production of cytokines and chemokines that have their levels and activities affected (21, 31\u201334). In the bone marrow, studies have shown that alcohol consumption promotes important effects on hematopoiesis (35, 36).\nIn this study, we evaluated the effect of ethanol on bone marrow at the level of metabolites. Once cellular metabolism plays an important role in the functionality of immune cells, changes in the metabolic profile can compromise their functionality (15).\nThe metabolomics profile revealed significant effects of chronic alcohol consumption on the metabolome of mouse bone marrow. Although the analytical restrictions of the gas chromatography approach limit the scope of the study to volatile compounds and/ or volatile compounds through derivatization, it was possible to obtain a holistic approach to the metabolic profile of this tissue as well as the changes resulting from chronic exposure to alcohol.\nNicotinamide (C6H6N2O) showed reduced abundance in cells from animals under chronic treatment with ethanol. Nicotinamide is the active form of vitamin B3 and a component of the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). When ethanol is metabolized, it generates a reduced cellular environment due to the use of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) as an\nFrontiers in Immunology 06\nenzymatic cofactor at both stages of its metabolism. The reduced cellular environment has been related to the dysfunctions observed in the cells of the immune system (2, 21, 37, 38). In addition, NAD+ is an enzyme cofactor used in important metabolic pathways such as glycolysis and the Krebs cycle, which have been reported to be essential for neutrophil and macrophage function (15, 39, 40). We hypothesize that ethanol metabolism limits the availability of NAD+ for cell metabolism, altering the metabolic profile. This alteration may be related to the negative effect of alcohol on the function of these cells. Our results suggest that this may be part of the mechanism by which alcohol alters metabolism in this tissue. Although functional studies are needed to confirm and elucidate this evidence.\nSuccinic acid, an important component of the TCA cycle, was recently identified as a modulator of the innate immune response. In lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-activated macrophages, succinate was identified as a key metabolite in innate immune response signaling since its increase is correlated to increased production of interleukin-1b during inflammation (41, 42). Furthermore, lipopolysaccharide-induced succinate stabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1a), an effect that is inhibited by 2-deoxyglucose, with interleukin-1b as an important target (41, 43). HIF-1a is an oxygendependent transcriptional activator that plays crucial roles in tumor angiogenesis and mammalian development (44). Furthermore, HIF-1a increases macrophage aggregation, invasion, and motility and boosts the expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines. HIF-1a also increases neutrophil survival by inhibiting apoptosis and triggering NF-kB-dependent neutrophilic inflammation (45). Succinate was also shown to promote hematopoietic cell proliferation by phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway and inositol phosphate accumulation in a pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive manner (46). Furthermore, succinate induced activation of ERK1/2, JNK, and p38 MAPK signaling pathways in immortalized retinal ganglion cells (RGC-5) cells in a dose-dependent manner (47). The ERK1/2 and MAPK pathways are related to the activation of the proinflammatory response of immune cells (48\u201350). Therefore, the deregulation in the amount of succinate found in this work can be considered a modulating mechanism of chronic alcohol consumption in the immune response.\nIn agreement with studies that investigated changes in the metabolome associated with alcohol consumption in humans, amino acids are the most representative chemical class (51). Tyrosine and proline are non-essential amino acids used in protein biosynthesis. Protein tyrosine (PTP) phosphorylation is an important post-translational modification that controls cell signaling involved in the regulation of a variety of biological processes, including cell growth, proliferation, differentiation, migration, survival, and death. The negative effect of downregulating these amino acids in the ethanol-treated group can impair an important biological process since tyrosine phosphorylation is considered one of the fundamental steps in signal transduction and regulation of enzymatic activity (52). However, studies that investigate the relationship between quantitative alterations of amino acids and the function of immune system cells were not found in the literature. The results\nFIGURE 2 Biological categorization of identified metabolites. All 19 identified metabolites were classified according to functional categorization in PubChem (https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). Percentages represent the number of classified metabolites in each category.\nfrontiersin.org\nfound here suggest that investigations in this direction may be promising for understanding the mechanism behind the harmful effect of alcohol on immune response. Once some amino acids like tyrosine can be catabolized all the way down into intermediaries of the Krebs cycle, especially into fumarate and acetoacetate (53).\nUracil is a common natural pyrimidine found in RNA and was found to be downregulated in the bone marrow of ethanol-treated mice. Despite not finding in the literature a direct relationship between this nucleotide and the function of immune cells, it is known that uracil helps to carry out the synthesis of many enzymes necessary for cell function through the interaction with ribose and phosphates and serves as an allosteric regulator and a coenzyme for many important biochemical reactions (54).\nA wide variety of types of RNAs act in the regulation of the immune system. microRNAs, RNA-binding proteins that control the stability and translation of messenger RNA (mRNA) and RNA interference (RNAi) are examples of RNAs that act by controlling the gene expression of cytokines and chemokines responsible for\nFrontiers in Immunology 07\nthe intercellular communication of the immune system (55, 56). The decrease in uracil levels resulting from the chronic consumption of ethanol in the bone marrow may indirectly compromise the entire elaboration of the immune response.\nMetabolic profiles can be considered a phenotypic state that undergoes variations under the influence of changes in the genome, proteome, transcriptome, metabolism, and modifications in the microenvironment where they are found (57). In our approach, we demonstrate for the first time that chronic ethanol consumption can alter the bone marrow microenvironment, and this can be associated with altered immune cell metabolism, leading to a programmed alteration function of the mature circulating cells. However, this is an initial, exploratory metabolomics study that brings important insights into cellular metabolism under alcohol exposure. We are aware of some limitations of our approach, such as the influence of animal gender in metabolism and susceptibility to alcohol, the use of other analytical platforms that should improve the number of identified metabolites, and the need for functional\nD\nA B\nC\nFIGURE 3 Multivariate models (Pareto scaling) of metabolites identified in cell samples analyzed by GC\u2013MS and discriminating metabolites between ethanoltreated and control groups by GC\u2013MS.

In addition, the effects of blood alcohol concentration and the effects of the products of its metabolism (e.g., acetaldehyde) can also be considered.
