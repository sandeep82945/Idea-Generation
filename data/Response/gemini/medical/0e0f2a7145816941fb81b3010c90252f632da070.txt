1. **Investigate the role of MASP49 in the pathogenesis of Chagas disease.** This could be done by studying the expression of MASP49 in different strains of T. cruzi and correlating it with the virulence of the strain. Additionally, animal models could be used to study the role of MASP49 in the development of Chagas disease.
2. **Identify the other host cell receptors that MASP49 binds to.** This could be done by using a variety of techniques, such as co-immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry. Once the receptors are identified, their role in the infection process could be studied.
3. **Determine the role of glycosylation in the function of MASP49.** This could be done by mutating the glycosylation sites on MASP49 and studying the effect of these mutations on the protein's binding to host cells and its ability to mediate infection.
4. **Develop inhibitors of MASP49-host cell receptor interactions.** These inhibitors could be used to prevent or treat Chagas disease.
5. **Investigate the potential of MASP49 as a vaccine target.** This could be done by studying the immunogenicity of MASP49 and its ability to protect against infection with T. cruzi.
