We revisit a class of self-similar solutions which was studied in Canonne-Planchon (1996). In order to shed some light on it, we study self-similar solutions to the 1D Burgers equation in detail, completing the most general form of similarity profiles that it can possibly possess. In particular, on top of the well-known source-type solution we identify a kink-type solution. It is represented by one of the confluent hypergeometric functions, viz. Kummer\u2019s function M. For the 2D Navier-Stokes equations, on top of the celebrated Burgers vortex we derive yet another solution to the associated Fokker-Planck equation. This can be regarded as a \u2019conjugate\u2019 to the Burgers vortex, just like the kink-type solution above. Some asymptotic properties of this kind of solution have been worked out. Implications for the 3D NavierStokes equations are suggested. Second, we address an application of self-similar solutions to explore more general kind of solutions. In particular, based on the source-type self-similar solution to the 3D Navier-Stokes equations, we consider what we could tell about more general solutions.

            "text": "Self-similarity is an useful concept in handling partial differential equations particularly arising from fluid mechanics. Our motivation for this study is as follows.\nAn initial-boundary-value problem for the 3D Navier-Stokes equations is studied in [1] postulating that the velocity field has a self-similar form, from the very initial data to the final state. To this end they introduced Besov spaces to accommodate a singular initial velocity field which is as rough as u(x) \u221d 1/x. The knock-on effect is that we would have similarity profiles, viz. steady solutions to the scaled Navier-Stokes equations, which are not welllocalised in space. In order to shed some light on its implications, we will take\nar X\niv :2\n20 1.\n04 77\n5v 1\n[ ph\nys ic\ns. fl\nudy\nn] 1\nup a simpler system, the 1D Burgers equation to consider solutions in such an enlarged function space. In particular, we will be concerned with the fate of solutions which are not in L1marginally, but in some Besov space nearby.\nThere are two schematic themes in this paper. One is the study of nonGaussian type solutions (loosely called \u2019kink-type\u2019 solutions) of scaled version of fluid dynamical equations. The other one is proposal of a new approach of constructing general solutions on the basis of particular source-type self-similar solutions.\nFor the first theme, non-Gaussian solutions are given explicitly with some of their properties discussed, whereas clarification of their possible significance as a dynamical system is left for further study. For the second theme a protocol for (re)building more general solutions out of self-similar solutions is exemplified using the Burgers and 2D Navier-Stokes equations. This suggests that applications to the 3D Navier-Stokes equations deserve further investigation.\nThis paper is organised as follows. We study self-similar profiles for the Burgers equation in Section 2, emphasising the properties of the newly identified kink-type solutions. We consider self-similar solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations, especially in two dimensions in Section 3. We address possible applications of those similar solutions, in particular about obtaining information regarding more general class of solutions in Section 4. Section 5 is devoted to summary and outlook."

            "text": "When it is demanded that the initial data themselves are self-similar, inevitably the initial velocity field goes singular like u(x) \u221d 1/x. This has difficulties both at the origin and at infinity: (1) it is singular and non-integrable at the origin and (2) its decay at far distances is too slow to be integrable. For those reasons, Besov spaces1 were introduced to construct solutions to the initial-boundary problem in [1].\nAssume the initial data is in a Besov space B03,\u221e(R3) but not in L3(R3). The construction is concerned with a class of solutions for t > 0, which are in B03,\u221e(R3) but not in L3(R3). The \u2019source-type\u2019 self-similar solutions are irrelevant here, because they are well-localised with a finite L3-norm. The obvious question is: which functions can the scaled solutions possibly tend to, if they approach steady solutions at all ?\nTo shed some light on solutions constructed in Besov spaces we consider a simpler problem of the 1D Burgers equation. For this purpose, instead of B03,\u221e(R3) we consider velocity fields in B01,\u221e(R1) to study an analogous problem in one spatial dimension. It is readily checked that the theory developed in [1] holds valid mutatis mutandis for the 1D Burgers equation.

It is well-known that (1) is linearisable by the so-called Cole-Hopf transform. We recall the basic results obtained in [5].\n\u2022 If \u222b x 0 u0(y)dy = o(x\n2) for large |x|, unique existence of solutions is guaranteed for all t > 0.\n\u2022 If \u222b x 0 u0(y)dy = O(x\n2) for large |x|, the existence of solutions is guaranteed only for finite time 0 \u2264 t < T .\nAn instructive example for the second result is given by u(x, t) = xt\u2212T [5].

(In this paper c, C,C1, . . . etc. denote constants which may be different from line to line.)\nWe now distinguish two cases.\n1. If C = 0, the problem is well-understood.

Either way we find the so-called source-type solution, e.g. [6, 7]\nU(\u03be) =\nC \u2032exp ( \u2212a\u03be 2\n2\u03bd ) 1\u2212 C \u2032\n2\u03bd \u222b \u03be 0 exp ( \u2212a\u03b7 2 2\u03bd ) d\u03b7 , (4)\nfor a constant C \u2032.

(5)\nIt is to be observed that the Cole-Hopf transform arises as a natural course of solution to the Riccati equation [8]. If the initial data u0 /\u2208 L1(R1), but u0 \u2208 B01,\u221e(R1), the other kind of solutions, i.e. the kink-type ones will come into play. Below we will discuss those solutions to (5) in detail."

We add the\nsubscript K to avoid confusion with the scaled velocity U .\nwhich is consistent with the boundary behaviour, i.e. the condition C 6= 0 above.\nOn the other hand, for the other solution UK we have as |\u03be| \u2192 \u221e\nUK\n( 1\u2212 B\n2A ,\n3 2 , A\u03be2 2\n) \u2248 ( A\u03be2\n2\n) B 2A\u22121\n\u221d \u03be BA\u22122,\nthus in this case we find\n\u03a8 \u221d e\u2212A\u03be 2/2\u03be B A\u22121 and U \u221d \u2212A\u03be +\n( B A \u2212 1 ) \u03be\u22121.\nWe should discard this option because, when A 6= 0, the corresponding U does not even belong to B01,\u221e(R1), due to the presence of the linear term in \u03be.\nWe conclude that for the kink solution, we should choose\n\u03a8 = C1\u03be exp ( \u2212 a 2\u03bd \u03be2 ) MK ( 1\u2212 C 2a , 3 2 , a 2\u03bd \u03be2 ) .\nIt may be in order to have a look at a specific example of the class of solutions. Replacing z \u2192 iz, in the following identity, e.g. [9],\nMK\n( 1\n2\n3 2 ,\u2212z2\n) = \u221a \u03c0\n2z erf(z),\nwe have\nMK\n( 1\n2\n3 2 , z2 ) = \u221a \u03c0 2iz erf(iz) = \u221a \u03c0 2z erfi(z).\nHere erf(z) = 2\u221a \u03c0 \u222b z 0 e\u2212t 2 dt denotes the error function and its imaginary version erfi(z) = 2\u221a \u03c0 \u222b z 0 et 2 dt. In order to make use of the identity, we take C/a = 1. With this a typical example can be given\n\u03a8 = C1\u03be exp ( \u2212 a 2\u03bd \u03be2 ) MK ( 1 2 3 2 , a\u03be2 2\u03bd ) = C1 \u221a 2\u03bd a D (\u221a a 2\u03bd \u03be ) ,\nwhere D(x) \u2261 e\u2212x2 \u222b x 0 et 2 dt = \u221a \u03c0 2 H[e\n\u2212x2 ] denotes Dawson\u2019s integral and H[\u00b7] the Hilbert transform. See Figs. 3, 4, in which we also assume a = 1 and \u03bd = 1/2 for simplicity. Note that the profile in Fig.4 is a steady solution in scaled space, which develops from the initial profile in the original variables in Fig.3 under time evolution.\nIt can be seen that in higher spatial dimensions (6) is generalised to\n4\u03a8 + a \u03bd (\u03be \u00b7 \u2207)\u03a8 + C \u03bd \u03a8 = 0. (8)\nHowever, representation formulas for solutions to (8) are not known. See Appendix C for a motivation or rationale for studying two different kinds of steady solutions."

            "text": "Generally speaking, we talk about forward self-similar solutions to study the decaying process in the late stage of evolution, whereas talk about backward self-similar solutions to study whether solutions blow up in finite time. Needless to mention, no solutions to the Burgers equation blow up if they start from welllocalised smooth initial data under natural boundary conditions. Nonetheless, because the backward problem differs from the forward problem only in the sign of the parameter a, if one of them is obtained it is readily transferable to the other one by flipping the sign of a, provided that we do not bother their boundary behaviour.\nIn the spirit of [1] we have studied forward self-similar solutions to the Burgers equation under the setting of B01,\u221e(R1). What would happen if we consider the backward self-similar solutions in the enlarged function class, or even broader one ?\nWe can study \u2019possible\u2019 blow up with backward self-similarity, putting\nu(x.t) = 1\n\u03bb(t) U\n( x\n\u03bb(t) ) with the length-scale \u03bb(t) = \u221a 2a(t\u2217 \u2212 t), where t\u2217 denotes the time of blowup. The steady equation reads\nU \u2202U\n\u2202\u03be + a\n( \u03be \u2202U\n\u2202\u03be + U\n) = \u03bd \u22022U\n\u2202\u03be2 ,\nto which the only smooth solution is a trivial one U \u2261 0 under natural boundary conditions and smoothness conditions. Relaxing those conditions, a non-trivial solution is nonetheless obtained as\nU(\u03be) = C \u2032ea\u03be 2/(2\u03bd) 1\u2212 C\u20322\u03bd \u222b \u03be 0 ea\u03b72/(2\u03bd)d\u03b7 .\nThis solution is badly-behaved at far distances;3 U(\u03be) \u221d \u03be as \u03be \u2192 \u00b1\u221e. Furthermore this has a singular point (a pole) somewhere, say at \u03be = \u03be\u2217, where the denominator vanishes. Thus we have U(\u03be) \u221d 1/(\u03be \u2212 \u03be\u2217) around it and is non-integrable U /\u2208 L1loc. See Fig.5.\nIt is of interest to have another look at the backward self-similar solution. We first recast the source-type solution using Kummer\u2019s function. Taking \u03b2 = 1/2 in the following identity [9]\ne\u2212zMK(1, \u03b2 + 1, z) = \u03b2z \u2212\u03b2\u03b3(\u03b2, z), where \u03b3(\u03b2, z) \u2261 \u222b z 0 t\u03b2\u22121e\u2212tdt, we have\ne\u2212zMK ( 1, 3\n2 , z\n) = z\u22121/2 \u222b \u221az 0 e\u2212s 2 ds.\n3In Appendix D of [12] it was stated erroneously that U(\u03be) \u2192 1|\u03be| as \u03be \u2192 \u00b1\u221e, which should be corrected as above.\nPutting z = a2\u03bd \u03be 2, we find\n\u03a8 = \u03be exp ( \u2212 a 2\u03bd \u03be2 ) MK ( 1, 3 2 , a 2\u03bd \u03be2 ) = \u221a \u03c0\u03bd 2a erf (\u221a a 2\u03bd \u03be ) .\nWhen we replace a\u2192 \u2212a, the right-hand side is changed as\n\u03a8\u2192 1 i\n\u221a \u03c0\u03bd\n2a erf\n( i \u221a a\n2\u03bd \u03be\n) = \u221a \u03c0\u03bd\n2a erfi\n(\u221a a\n2\u03bd \u03be\n) ,\nwhich agrees with backward self-similar solution obtained above. Note that the asymptotic formula for MK(\u03b1, \u03b3, z) for |z| \u2192 \u221e does not hold valid for \u03b1 = 1, because \u0393(1) = 0.\nIt may be interesting to consider the following question. The existence of the forward self-similar (source-type) solutions U to the 3D Navier-Stokes equations is known. Suppose we make a replacement a \u2192 \u2212a in such solutions, the backward profile U must be singular and/or ill-behaved at far distances, in view of the non-existence of self-similar blowup [10, 11]. We would still be interested in what kind of spatial structure the profile possesses because such a solution may be helpful in putting constraints under the replacement a \u2194 \u2212a on the sought-after forward source-type solutions.\n1\u2212\n\u222b \u03be\n0 e\u2212\u03b72d\u03b7.\nD(\u03be) = \u2212 1\u22122\u03beD(\u03be) D(\u03be) ."

In other words, the source-type solution encodes the vital information as to how we may linearise this nonlinear equation.\nWe don\u2019t intend to add anything new to the understanding of the Burgers equation, rather we will show how we can recover the Cole-Hopf transformation on the basis of a particular self-similar solution (viz. the source type solution).\nLet us pretend that we don\u2019t know the Cole-Hopf transformation. It\u2019s still straightforward to derive the source-type solution, which is slightly nonGaussian. It is then possible to recover the Cole-Hopf linearisation by replacing the self-similar heat flow with a general heat flow, which we call the lifting procedure.\nFor illustration we will have a look at the details of the procedure. Assume that the velocity potential \u03a6(\u03be) is given by\n\u03a6(\u03be) = f(\u03a8\u0302),\nwhere f is a function of the self-similar source type solution of the heat equation \u03a8\u0302 = \u222b \u03be 0 exp ( \u2212a\u03b7 2 2\u03bd ) d\u03b7.

(13)\nIt should be noted that hereafter the arguments x, y, etc. in the function F do not represent spatial coordinates.\nThe procedure of spotting (or, recovering, in this case) more general solutions can be formalised in the following steps.\nStep 1. Assume a self-similar profile is obtained in the form\nU(\u03be) = F (\u03a8\u0302(\u03be); \u2202\u03be\u03a8\u0302(\u03be)) \u2261 \u2202\u03be\u03a8\u0302\n1\u2212 12\u03bd \u03a8\u0302 . (14)\nThe profile U(\u03be) is a near-identity transformation of the last argument of the\nfunction, i.e. that of the Gaussian function \u2202\u03be\u03a8\u0302(\u03be). Luckily for the Burgers equation F (\u00b7; \u00b7) is known explicitly F (x; y) = y1\u2212x/(2\u03bd) , as indicated by the symbol \u2261 above. By definition, a particular solution is obtained by reverting to the original variables:\nu(x, t) = 1\u221a 2at F\n( \u03a8\u0302 ( x\u221a 2at ) ; \u2202\u03be\u03a8\u0302 ( x\u221a 2at )) \u2261 1\u221a 2at \u2202\u03be\u03a8\u0302( x\u221a 2at )\n1\u2212 12\u03bd \u03a8\u0302( x\u221a 2at\n) .\nStep 2. Replacing the self-similar heat solution with the general heat flow, we obtain a more general class of solutions\nu(x, t) = 1\u221a 2at\nF ( \u03c8\u0302 (x, t) ; \u221a 2at\u2202x\u03c8\u0302 (x, t) ) = F ( \u03c8\u0302 (x, t) ; \u2202x\u03c8\u0302 (x, t) ) \u2261 \u2202x\u03c8\u0302(x, t)\n1\u2212 12\u03bd \u03c8\u0302(x, t) ,\nwhere\n\u03c8\u0302(x, t) = 1\u221a\n4\u03c0\u03bdt \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e \u03c8\u0302(y, 0) exp ( \u2212 (x\u2212 y) 2 4\u03bdt ) dy\ndenotes the general heat flow. Note that the length scales \u221a\n2at cancel out because of (13). In the case of the Burgers equation, this last form provides the general solution.\nBefore closing this subsection it may be in order to emphasise the following fact. In terms of the scaled velocity potential \u03a6(\u03be) the exact solution is given by \u03a6 = \u22122\u03bd log ( 1\u2212 12\u03bd \u03a8\u0302 ) , whose leading-order approximation agrees with the scaled heat flow \u03a6(\u03be) \u2248 \u03a8\u0302(\u03be). This confirms the near-identity nature of \u03a6(\u03be)."

            "text": "We take the vorticity curl, \u03c7 = \u2207 \u00d7 \u03c9 as the basic dependent variable, whose dynamically-scaled version is denoted by X(\u03be). With this choice, the linearised equations have the Fokker-Planck operator In view of the critical scale-invariance of type 2 [13] it is most convenient for our analysis, as the leading-order approximation is basically given by the Gaussian function, i.e. the Gaussian function modulo incompressibility.\nThe steady version of the dynamically-scaled Navier-Stokes equations reads [13]\n4\u2217X \u2261 4X + a \u03bd \u2207 \u00b7 (\u03be \u2297X) = \u22121 \u03bd 4P\n( 4\u22121X \u00b7 \u22074\u22121X ) . (15)\nBy a formal analysis we show the following\nProposition 4.1 The successive approximations to the solution X of the equations (15) are given by a functional 5 of\n{(\u2207\u00d7)k\u03a8\u0302(\u03be) | k = 0, 1, 2, 3}. 5It is a functional rather than a function as we need to take into account nonlocal interac-\ntions due to the incompressible condition.\nHere (\u2207\u00d7)3\u03a8\u0302(\u03be) = PMG, defined with M = \u222b X(\u03be)d\u03be, G = ( a\n2\u03c0\u03bd )3/2 exp(\u2212 a2\u03bd |\u03be| 2)\nand P solenoidal projection such that \u2207 \u00b7 \u03a8\u0302(\u03be) = 0.\nNote that \u03a8\u0302(\u03be) denotes the scaled heat flow, whereas \u03a8(\u03be) the scaled vector potential.\nProof We consider the following expansion for small > 0,\nX(\u03be) = X1 + 2X2 + 3X3 + . . . ,\ndeferring the justification of smallness of by its identification as the Reynolds number. We prove by mathematical induction that each Xn can be represented by a combination of functionals of \u03a8\u0302(\u03be), including e.g. 4\u22121\u03a8\u0302 and the derivatives of \u03a8\u0302(\u03be). Equating the terms with the same powers in , we derive equations for Xn for n \u2265 1.\n(i) We will first confirm that this is the case for n = 1. To leading order at O( ) we have\n4\u2217X1 = 0,\nfrom which it follows that X1 = PMG. Indeed X1 is a functional of the desired form. By definition X1 = (\u2207\u00d7)3\u03a81(\u03be), we also note that the leading-order approximation satisfies \u03a81(\u03be) = \u03a8\u0302(\u03be).\n(ii) Assuming that the statement holds up to step k(\u2264 n), we will deduce that the it also holds for step (n+ 1). For illustration let us first take a look at, for example, O( 2) and O( 3). To next-to-leading order at O( 2) we have\n4\u2217X2 = \u2212 1\n\u03bd 4P(4\u22121X1 \u00b7 \u22074\u22121X1)\nand at the third order O( 3)\n4\u2217X3 = \u2212 1\n\u03bd 4P(4\u22121X1 \u00b7 \u22074\u22121X2 +4\u22121X2 \u00b7 \u22074\u22121X1).\nLikewise, at O( n+1) for \u2200n \u2208 N, we have\n4\u2217Xn+1 = \u2212 1\n\u03bd 4P n\u2211 l=1 (4\u22121Xl \u00b7 \u22074\u22121Xn+1\u2212l),\nor\nXn+1 = \u2212(\u03bd4\u2217)\u221214P n\u2211 l=1 (4\u22121Xl \u00b7 \u22074\u22121Xn+1\u2212l). (16)\nHere use has been made of the inverse Fokker-Planck operator is given by [13] (\u03bd4\u2217)\u22121 \u2261 \u2212 \u222b \u221e 0 dse\u03bds4 \u2217 = \u222b d\u03b7g(\u03be,\u03b7)\nwith\ng(\u03be,\u03b7) \u2261 \u22121 (2\u03c0\u03bd)3/2 f.p. \u222b \u221e \u221a a \u03c32d\u03c3 \u03c32 \u2212 a e\u2212 1 2\u03bd |\u03c3\u03be\u2212\u03b7 \u221a \u03c32\u2212a|2 ,\nwhere f.p. denotes Hadamard\u2019s finite part. Noting that (4\u2217)\u221214P represents an integral operator of order zero, we see that the right-hand side of (16) is a functional of Xk\u2019s (1 \u2264 k \u2264 n). Because they are all represented as functionals of \u03a8\u0302(\u03be) and its derivatives, so is Xn+1. Hence we deduce that Xn can be expressed as a functional of \u03a8\u0302(\u03be) and its derivatives for all n \u2208 N. We note that that the nonlinear contribution Xn (n \u2265 2) has the second order derivative of \u03a81(\u03be) at most and the (5\u2212 2n)-th order derivative at least. At n = 3 already we have 5\u22122n < 0 and this means that it may involve integrals of \u03a81(\u03be), hence F may be a functional, rather than a function. We also note that when the -expansion is uniformly convergent, X itself is a functional of \u03a8\u0302(\u03be) and its derivatives. To see how we can make arbitrarily small, take for example, the next-to-leading order approximation (iteration) [13]\nX = X1 \u2212 1 \u03bd P ( 4\u22121X1 \u00b7 \u22074\u22121X1 ) = PMG\u2212 1\n\u03bd P ( 4\u22121PMG \u00b7 \u22074\u22121PMG ) . (17)\nIntroducing the following variables for non-dimensionalisation X\u0303 = X/\u03bd andM\u0303 = M/\u03bd, we find\nX\u0303 = PM\u0303G\u2212 P ( 4\u22121PM\u0303G \u00b7 \u22074\u22121PM\u0303G ) ,\nwhere Re = |M\u0303 | = |M |/\u03bd denotes the Reynolds number. Identifying Re = , this corresponds to the O( 2) approximation. We can argue similarly for the O( n) approximations as well for \u2200n \u2208 N.\nOn the basis of Proposition 4.1, we consider a self-similar profile in the following form6\nX(\u03be) = F ( \u03a8\u0302(\u03be),\u2207\u00d7 \u03a8\u0302(\u03be), (\u2207\u00d7)2\u03a8\u0302(\u03be); (\u2207\u00d7)3\u03a8\u0302(\u03be) ) (18)\nfor some functional F , where \u03a8\u0302 denotes the scaled heat flow, (\u2207\u00d7)3\u03a8\u0302 = PKG\u0302, K is a function of M = \u222b X(\u03be)d\u03be and G\u0302 = exp(\u2212 a2\u03bd |\u03be|\n2). The functional F (x,y, z;w) is a near-identity transformation of the last argument w (the solenoidal Gaussian function) and satisfies\nF (x, \u03b1y, \u03b12z;\u03b13w) = \u03b13F (x,y, z;w) for \u2200\u03b1 > 0. (19)\nThe profile (18) is a rather strong assumption, even though we take it approximately. If F is available, at least part of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations\n6Care should be taken of the notations; it means that F is a functional of \u03a8\u0302 and its derivatives with (\u2207\u00d7)3\u03a8\u0302 at the highest.\nis reducible to those of the heat equations. Unfortunately, the precise form of F is not known at the moment, but we know that it is close to the Gaussian and how close it is [13]. Assuming that F is obtained, the procedure goes as follows.\nStep 1. When the self-similar profile F is given explicitly, a particular self-similar solution is obtained as\n\u03c7(x, t) = 1\n(2at)3/2 F\n( \u03a8\u0302 ( x\u221a 2at ) ,\u2207\u00d7 \u03a8\u0302 ( x\u221a 2at ) , (\u2207\u00d7)2\u03a8\u0302 ( x\u221a 2at ) ; (\u2207\u00d7)3\u03a8\u0302 ( x\u221a 2at )) .\nStep 2. We seek a more general class of solution on this basis\n\u03c7(x, t) = 1 (2at)3/2 F ( \u03c8\u0302(x, t), (2at)1/2\u2207\u00d7 \u03c8\u0302(x, t), 2at (\u2207\u00d7)2\u03c8\u0302(x, t); (2at)3/2 (\u2207\u00d7)3\u03c8\u0302(x, t) ) .\nThe first three arguments give rise to a factor of (2at)3/2 in total, as a result of scaling (19) and hence we have\n\u03c7(x, t) = F ( \u03c8\u0302(x, t),\u2207\u00d7 \u03c8\u0302(x, t), (\u2207\u00d7)2\u03c8\u0302(x, t); (\u2207\u00d7)3\u03c8\u0302(x, t) ) .\nIt is not known how general a class of functions such a construction can cover. To see how cancellations take place, it is helpful to consider the following example based on the next-to-leading order approximation. On the right-most side of (17), the first term gives rise to (2at)3/2 so does the second (2at)1/2 \u00b7 (2at) = (2at)3/2.\nRemark In three dimensions, under the assumption of \u03a8 = f(\u03a8\u0302), a simpler form of F can be obtained using spatial derivatives rather than curls. Write\nX = F\u0303 ( \u03a8\u0302, D\u03a8\u0302, D2\u03a8\u0302;D3\u03a8\u0302 ) ,\nwhere Di = \u2202\u03bei i = 1, 2, 3 stands for any spatial derivatives. After some algebra we find explicitly\nXi = \u2212 ikq { \u2202sj \u2202\u03bek \u2202sm \u2202\u03bel \u2202sn \u2202\u03bel \u22023fq \u2202sj\u2202sm\u2202sn + ( \u2202sj \u2202\u03bek 4sm + 2 \u22022sj \u2202\u03bek\u2202\u03bel \u2202sm \u2202\u03bel ) \u22022fq \u2202sj\u2202sm + \u22024sj \u2202\u03bek \u2202fq \u2202sj } where we have put si = \u03a8\u0302i(\u03be) for simplicity. Observe that the above expression reduces to X = \u2212\u2207\u00d74\u03a8\u0302. for the identity transformation \u2202fq\u2202sj = \u03b4qj ."

As part of forward self-similar solutions to the Burgers equation we have identified a class of kink-type solutions, on top of the well-known source-type solutions. They are given by Kummer\u2019s confluent hypergeometric function MK. We also noted ill-behaved \u2019blow-up\u2019 profiles by flipping the sign of the parameter a.\nWe discussed the Navier-Stokes equations; in two dimensions we discussed a self-similar profile which may be regarded as a conjugate to the Burgers vortex. Some of its asymptotic properties have been studied, whereas clarification of its significance it may play, e.g. its stability as a dynamical system, requires further investigation.\nWe also discussed applications of the self-similar solution in three dimensions. Some properties of the self-similar profile have been analysed formally and possible lifting to more general class of solutions, at least approximately, is suggested. For the final topic, it may be worthwhile to try computing approximate solutions by numerical methods. This is also left for future study."
