    "abstractText": "IoT devices play a fundamental role in the machine learning (ML) application pipeline, as they collect rich data for model training using sensors. However, this process can be affected by uncontrollable variables that introduce errors into the data, resulting in a higher computational cost to eliminate them. Thus, selecting the most suitable algorithm for this pre-processing step on-device can reduce ML model complexity and unnecessary bandwidth usage for cloud processing. Therefore, this work presents a new sensor taxonomy with which to deploy data pre-processing on an IoT device by using a specific filter for each data type that the system handles. We define statistical and functional performance metrics to perform filter selection. Experimental results show that the Butterworth filter is a suitable solution for invariant sampling rates, while the Savi\u2013Golay and medium filters are appropriate choices for variable sampling rates.",

            "text": "Internet of Things (IoT) technology allows electronic devices to be deployed in indoor and outdoor environments to collect data [1]. Commonly, these IoT devices consist of a microcontroller, sensors, a battery, and wireless communicationelectronic devices to be deployed in indoor and outdoor environments to collect data. IoT devices can be installed in harsh scenarios due to their flexible development [2]. Nowadays, about 22 billion IoT devices are uploading data to the cloud. Every year, this number increases exponentially to continue collecting data through a wide variety of sensors. These data are used to train machine learning (ML) models, powerful tools that can find hidden knowledge in data that describes a phenomenon or human behavior [3]. However, constantly uploading data to the cloud causes bottlenecks in the communication channel, and in some cases, the stored data are not processed for a specific purpose [4]. Hence, cloud computing servers have to delete data periodically to avoid storage overload. Consequently, data quality is essential to reduce the complexity of the ML model, and it is necessary to send only relevant data to be processed. Therefore, after the data gathering process, a data pre-processing step is required to eliminate errors, which means both stages are part of the ML pipeline [5]. There are several repositories in different areas where researchers and developers can obtain databases to deploy and test ML models. They assume that the data are cleaned before being put into the repository. Nevertheless, this is not the case for IoT environments,\nInformation 2022, 13, 241. https://doi.org/10.3390/info13050241 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/information\nwhere sensors gather data in situ because they describe specific parameters such as environmental conditions, gas concentration, and location. In conclusion, data gathering and pre-processing are obligatory stages of building an ML application in IoT environments. The data collection stage in IoT environments needs to handle uncontrolled conditions such as environmental changes, construction failures of microcontrollers and sensors that cause poor calibration, and vibrations in their working environment, among others [6]. Therefore, model inference can reduce performance, resulting in the use of complex models when describing a phenomenon or human behavior [7]. The pre-processing stage produces reliable, accurate, repeatable, and error-free data [8]. Thus, the electrical signal obtained by the sensors should be acquired with an adequate sampling rating and proper tuning of analog-to-digital converters [9]. On the software side, digital filters are applied when data have been stored on servers. However, sensors have different data collecting procedures, such as digital-analog converters, communication ports, and pulse trains [10]. Therefore, the cloud can not apply a standard filtering process to all the features stored. Additionally, this data flow over communication channels increases security concerns and decreases user confidence in the system. Therefore, new computational paradigms propose decentralized computing where some ML stages run closer to the user, which means performing datapreprocessing locally [11]. It is worth pointing out that these algorithms can be deployed on IoT devices due to the microcontrollers\u2019 increasing computing capacity, which will not affect battery consumption [12]. Additionally, sensors vendors are working to give the IoT developer robust libraries to improve sensor management [13]. However, sensor data need to be pre-processed before sending it to the cloud [14]. Data filtering removes noise by comparing each signal component to the rest and eliminating the unusual ones. The most relevant criteria and their principal algorithms are infinite impulse response (IIR) with the approximations Butterworth, Bessel, and Chebyshev; finite impulse response (FIR) with the windows Hamming, Tayler, Barlett, and Blackman; and smoothing filters with the algorithms: mean, average, Gaussian, and Savi\u2013 Golay [14]. For more information about digital filter design, we suggest following these works [15,16]. These filter criteria depend on the sampling rate at which the IoT device is configured, the collection procedure of each sensor, and the application. However, previous sensor taxonomies focus on hardware characteristics without considering their primary purpose of collecting data. In addition, data filtering criteria are applied for each IoT development, which consumes additional time for IoT researchers and developers. It is necessary to define a new sensor taxonomy related to the data collection and preprocessing processes that fits the filtering criteria to be part of the whole ML pipeline [17]. Therefore, this work introduces a new sensor taxonomy oriented to pre-processing data on-device according to the type of sensor used in the IoT application. Consequently, we need to define how IoT devices collect data through sensors to determine the suitable filter for each case. Our summarized contributions are:\n\u2022 We define a new sensor taxonomy related to data gathering and data pre-processing on-device. \u2022 We determined that the main sensor characteristic for classification is sampling rate. \u2022 We introduce a data filtering scheme using the most representative algorithms/models\nof infinite impulse response (IIR), finite impulse response (FIR), and smoothing filters by setting specific sampling rates for each sensor type.\n\u2022 We compare data filtering criteria to select the suitable ones for the proposed taxonomy of sensors and ensure its usefulness in computationally constrained IoT environments. \u2022 We performed tests on sensor data with statistical and functional metrics.\nThe main result of this work is defining the Butterworth filter as a suitable criterion for analog sensors with invariant sampling rates. Meanwhile, Savi\u2013Golay fits analog sensors with varying sampling frequencies. The average filter is adequate with this signal in digital pulse train sensors. Savi\u2013Golay and medium filters remove noise and preserve the main signal characteristics regarding communication protocol sensors.\nThe rest of the manuscript is structured as follows: Section 2 shows related works and signal filtering background. Then, Section 3 introduces the proposed sensor taxonomy. Next, the methodology is shown in Section 4. Results are presented in Section 5 with the statistical and sensor functionality metrics to define the filter algorithm we chose. Finally, Section 6 shows conclusions and future work."

Indeed, new technology trends such as the Internet of Things (IoT) allowed expanding the research areas where sensors are used. Therefore, new ways to describe/classify them are relevant, since they play a significant role in the data-gathering stage of the entire machine learning application pipeline. Thus, in the early stages of sensor development, works such as MacRuairi et al. [18] presented sensor requirements taxonomies to match specific sensors with real scenarios. Then, Fowler et al. [19] presented a survey related to the materials that sensors are made from. Following this classification scheme, works such as Tuukkanen et al. [20], Noel et al. [21], Cornacchia et al. [22], and Khanh et al. [23] presented sensors surveys for specific areas, such as piezoelectric sensors, health monitoring, wearable sensors, and intelligent agriculture, respectively. In recent years, Abdel Azeem et al. [17] have shown the fundamentals, challenges, opportunities, and taxonomy of sensors in IoT environments describing the needs and usages of each one. They also presented a wide array of previously proposed solutions, comparing them to each other and providing brief descriptions of the issues addressed by each category of that taxonomy. Finally, works such as Latifi et al. [24] and Anajeba et al. [25] presented early intuitions about improving the security of the communication channel in IoT environments. In the ML application pipeline, Morrison et al. [26] present an innovative survey in sensor data collection and analytical systems. Additionally, Infanteena et al.

[14] presenting a relevant work about a data H\u221e filtering approach for wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in nonuniform sampling periods with optimization techniques. Then, Deepshukha et al. [29] designed a low-power digital FIR filter on FPGA for noise reduction in a WSN. Later, Bose et al. [2] presented an analysis of contemporary lossy compression algorithms using the signal characteristics of sensor data. At the same time, Safaei et al. [30] showed a novel approach to integrating time-series analysis, entropy, and random forest-based classification. For their part, Kowalski et al. [31] presented a review and comparison of smoothing algorithms for one-dimensional data noise reduction in specific sensors and environments. Timo et al. [12] presented outlier detection from non-smooth sensor data, as they worked in spatial discontinuities in the data, such as those arising from shadows in photovoltaic (PV) systems. Saad et al. [32] analyzed how quantization affects distributed graph filtering over both time-invariant and time-varying graphs. We bring insights into the quantization effects of the two most common graph filters: the finite impulse response (FIR) and auto-regressive moving average (ARMA) graph filters. In addition, we have proposed robust filter design strategies that minimize the quantization noise for time-invariant and time-varying networks. Several works have delved into data pre-processing in IoT devices, but most introduced approaches for specific scenarios without a rationale for the selected filter criterion.\nOn the one hand, outlier detection is a complex task for determining if external causes have corrupted the data. Therefore, as mentioned in [33], the filtering process must be carried on before the outlier detection stage. On the other hand, filtering can avoid physical constraints by giving a clean dataset to implement different stages. Finally, the literature review allowed us to observe open challenges in data filtering, such as the lack of a sensor taxonomy related to the data acquisition process and the establishment of adequate sampling rates for each type of sensor."

The ability to recreate the original signal is related to the resolution of the ADC, which is the number of bits that the microprocessor has for this process. Therefore, the sampling rate is the most relevant characteristic of the filter implementation criteria. Hence, we divide them into two categories:\n\u2022 Invariant sampling rate: These sensors are developed for collecting signals continuously to detect changes in a main characteristic. For example, the processing of human electrical activity through electromyography (muscle), electrocardiogram (heart), electroencephalogram (EEG), or galvanic skin response (hands). \u2022 Variant sampling rate: These sensors run a couple of times a day due to their applications. They do not have a specific sampling frequency because the system focuses on taking the same number of samples each time it is activated [6]."

Therefore, capacitors are often used in this type of sensor. \u2022 Logic states sensors: use only two logical values, 3.3 vs. or 5 vs., when detecting a physical magnitude, no matter their variations, and 0v when the sensor cannot catch the magnitude. Thus, for example, the human presence sensor can not give us more information about the phenomenon, just its presence."

Second, the variable sample rate sensors were exposed to their physical magnitude for 10 s, and then they returned to their initial condition (flexometer and force sensors). Consequently, this process was carried out ten times to store 1000 samples with a 100 Hz sample rate. A similar procedure was carried out with pulse train sensors, such as DTH11 and MQ135. Finally, communication protocol sensors (SCD30 and VMLE) were tested in 10 controlled experiments. As a result, we stored 500 samples with a 50 Hz sample rate because their response times are higher than those of the other sensors."

Therefore, a fast Fourier transform was implemented to define that the EMG components were between 5 and 40 Hz, which are presented in Figure 4. Then, IIR filters were the first approach with Chebyshev, Butterworth, and Bessel approximations with 3, 5, and 7 orders of band-pass filter design. We noticed that the filters in order 5 fit better than the rest. Table 2 summarizes the results of the statistical metrics mentioned before. The Butterworth filter demonstrated superior SNR, MAE, and R2 metrics. Additionally, it is visible that Butterworth reduced the noise with few signal alterations. The second approach was FIR filters. They focus on a time-domain analysis through windows. Reference [35] defines that using 10% as a window size of sample rate is recommended. Thus, we defined window sizes of 150, 250, and 300 components to compare with the ECG signal. Table 3 summarizes that windows size equal to 150 components produced a better SNR when Nutall window was applied. However, the differences between the windows were minimal when we tried to improve the signal. As a result, FIR filters are a better option than IIR. Finally, Figure 4 shows the components in the frequency domain and the graphical results of FIR and IIR filters."

Both were tested with the sample rate mentioned above (100 Hz). Additionally, their datasheet recommends using an analog\namplifier in follow-up configuration to avoid DC voltage. Therefore, we applied smoothing filters. The average filter has a better SNR metric; however, the R2 score indicates that this filter affects the original signal. Additionally, the Gaussian filter tends to round off the maximum values obtained and modifies the output signal due to sigma parameter (Gaussian bell size). The Savi\u2013Golay filter eliminates noise in VSR signals: see the strong results in R2 score and SNR metrics (Table 4). Figure 5 shows the graphical results of each smoothing filter.\nSensor performance metrics: These sensors have a variable resistor as their main component. Therefore, they are stable in operation, and similar data can be obtained in each data gathering process. However, their wear and tear is very high, subject to human activity. For this reason, they are dependent on their location and use, and their reproducibility tends to decrease over time."

These experiments demonstrated that Savi\u2013Golay and average filters fit with these kinds\nof signals and have better SNR metrics. Consequently, we noticed that the average filter reduces the dc voltage (peaks), producing good R2 score, MAE, and MSE results (Table 5). Moreover, Figure 6 represents the smoothing signal applied in pulse train sensors, from which we can notice that medium and Savi\u2013Golay filters do not modify the electric signal.
