 Here are 5 potential future research directions based on the paper:

1. Extend the model to allow for more general objectives and constraints for the principal. For example, the principal may care about both agent success probabilities and budget expenditure, or there may be constraints on the minimum payments to agents. How does this affect the structure of optimal contracts?

2. Incorporate dynamics into the model, where agents interact over multiple periods. How do concepts like reputation and repeated interactions impact optimal contract design? Can the principal benefit from long-term contracts? 

3. Allow for more complex tasks and interdependencies between agents. For instance, agents may need to collaborate and their probabilities of success become correlated. How does this affect competition versus collaboration under optimal contracts?

4. Empirically test the theoretical predictions, for example in a lab experiment. Does the competitive structure induced by successful-get-everything contracts improve effort compared to piece-rate or bonus-pool contracts? 

5. Extend the techniques to other multi-agent principal-agent settings. For example, optimal contract design when agents have limited liability, or when there is uncertainty about agent costs. Do similar dimensionality reduction results hold more broadly?
