    "abstractText": "Iridium-catalyzed azide-thioalkyne cycloaddition reaction (IrAAC) has proved to be a powerful tool for the synthesis of fully substituted 1,2,3-triazole compounds with exclusive regioselectivity. Here we report its successful use in the precise construction of stereocontrolled oligomers that have great potential in diverse applications. Starting with the azide derived from L-prolinol and different functionalized thioalkynes, chiral 1,2,3-triazole units were fabricated with high efficiency under the IrAAC condition, which were further assembled into stereocontrolled oligotriazoles through metal-free exponential growth strategies. The structure and uniformity of these oligomers were well identified by 1H NMR, size-exclusion chromatography, and mass spectrometry, the stereoregularity of which were studied through circular dichroism and circular polarized luminescence analysis.",

            "text": "Iridium-catalyzed transformations have evolved as one significant part in organic synthesis [1,2]. Especially noteworthy is the cycloaddition of unsaturated motifs under iridium catalysis, some of which afford carbocyclic or heterocyclic skeletons in unique manners [3]. For instance, in the metal-catalyzed annulations of alkynes with organic azides, regioselective fabrication of disubstituted 1,2,3-triazoles has been well controlled by different metal complexes [4\u20136], while construction of 1,4,5-trisubstituted 1,2,3-triazoles with exclusive regioselectivity has been hardly achieved [7]. One emblematic example is the iridium-catalyzed cycloaddition of 1-thioalkynes with azide (IrAAC) that can regulate the selectivity in a perfect fashion [8]. In combination with its simple and mild condition, as well as great compatibility with various solvents, IrAAC exhibits great potential in the construction of complex molecules with high tacticity. Precise assembly of small homochiral molecules into macromolecules is a naturally occurring process in all of the known life-forms, which is also utilized in the production of diverse stereocontrolled peptidomimetics and nucleotidomimetics for various functional applications [9\u201313]. Construction of abiotic polymers with well-defined monomer sequence and exact chain-length has experienced a significant development in the last two decades [14\u201319]. Nevertheless, efficient introduction of chirality into their backbone is still a challenging issue [20\u201326]. One facile protocol is to achieve the preparation of extensible monomers from natural chiral molecules. L-Proline is the only proteinogenic secondary amino acid, the distinctive cyclic structure of which endows its polymer with exceptional conformational rigidity [27,28]. By using one organic azide derived from L-prolinol, we realized the synthesis of chiral fully substituted triazole building blocks and their precise assembly into stereocontrolled sequence-defined oligotriazoles [29]. However, functional variations in the side chain of these oligomers are limited to some extent. By\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3726. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28093726 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3726 2 of 16\ncontrast, multifarious side groups were conveniently installed at the C4 position of triazole motifs (Scheme 1A) [30]. As a continuation of our research in the precise synthesis of macromolecules [31\u201334], here we report the construction of an improved stereocontrolled polytriazole architecture from novel chiral triazole units that are prepared by IrAAC (Scheme 1B). To demonstrate the tolerance of this stereoregular skeleton for functionalities, three kinds of oligomers bearing different side chains were precisely fabricated, the structure and monodispersity of which were well characterized by 1H NMR, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) and mass spectrometry (MS) analysis. It is noteworthy that in comparison with the previous work, this newly introduced architecture was established through one metal-free exponential growth strategy at a higher efficiency. The optical properties of the oligomers involving tetraphenylethane (TPE) were further explored by ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy (UV-Vis), fluorescence spectroscopy (FL), circular dichroism (CD), and circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) analysis, the results of which, together with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, identified their stereoregularity.\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 16\nvariations in the side chain of these oligomers are limited to some extent.

To demonstrate the efficiency of this protocol, elongation of triazole units 4a and 4b to corresponding octamers was carried out. Related reaction details of these two growth processes and MS data of involved oligotriazoles are summarized in Table 1.

One decreasing trend of the yields in\nMolecules 2023, 28, 3726 4 of 16\nthe Hofmann alkylation steps was observed with the elongation of the chain lengths. Nevertheless, the two octamers 8a and 8b were successfully constructed in overall yields of 7.3% and 7.6%, respectively.\nThe identity and high purity of all the monomers and oligomers involved in Table 1 were well verified by their own 1H NMR spectra provided in the Supplementary Materials. Compounds of \u03b1-Boc-\u03c9-OH type were also characterized by SEC, the traces of which confirmed their monodispersity as well as the elongation of the chain length after each cycle (Figure 1A,C). MS analysis of them was further conducted to illustrate the precise synthesis of these oligomers. As shown in Figure 1B,D, multiple signals of cationic adducts were observed in the mass spectra of both 8a and 8b, all of which were in excellent consistency with calculated molecular mass. Encouraged by the accomplishment of two above octamers, we next explored the extension of triazole unit 4c to stereocontrolled oligomers bearing tetraphenylethylene (TPE) groups. TPE is a typical luminophore featuring an aggregation-induced emission (AIE) phenomenon and has been widely utilized in the creation of various AIE materials [35]. Howbeit, research on the exact control of its number in precise chains is still exiguous [36,37]. As shown in Scheme 3A, conversion of 4c into 4c-OTs and 4c-H went smoothly, affording them in 82% and 89% yields, respectively. Subsequent coupling of 4c-OTs and 4c-H generated 70% of dimer 5c, which was then split for the synthesis of 5c-OTs and 5c-H. Similar to the above cases, a moderate yield of 53% was observed in the fabrication of tetramer 6c from 5c-OTs and 5c-H. To produce a series of oligomers bearing different amounts of TPE in an arithmetic sequence, which might be helpful in optical property studies, hexamer 7c was created by the coupling of tetramer 6c-H with dimer 5c-OTs in 20% yield.

Unfortunately, no obvious signals were observed in CD or CPL spectra (Figure 3A,B), which indicated their irregular folding behaviors. As shown in Figure 3C, the spatial structure of hexamer 7c resulted from MD simulation exhibits no helical chain. This could be attributed to he large n mber of flexible bonds in the backbone. More st ained skeletons need to be designed on the basis of this w rk for the development of chiroptical macromolecules with controlled circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) properties.\n400 450 500 550 600 650 700\n0\n6\n-6\n-4\n-2\n2\n4\nWavelength (nm)\nA B\n4c 5c 6c 7c\n250 300 350 400 Wavelength (nm)\n0\n2\n-2\n-4\n-6\n-8\n-10\nC D\n/m de\ng\nC P\nL In\nte ns\nity\nC\nFigure 3.

Three oligotriazoles bearing different side chains were fabricated to illustrate the fidelity of this protocol, all of which were well identified by 1H NMR, MS, and SEC characterizations. Investigations of the photophysical performances of TPE-involved oligotriazoles as well as the related MD simulation results illustrated the potential application of this newly introduced structure in the development of advanced functional materials exhibiting chiroptical properties.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28093726/s1, Copies of 1H NMR, 13C NMR and MS spectra (if any) of the products.\nAuthor Contributions: S.D. conceived and designed the study.
