    "abstractText": "A phytochemical investigation of the leaves and twigs of Glycosmis pentaphylla (Rutaceae), collected in Vietnam, yielded three new compounds named glyfuran (1), glyphyllamide (2), and glyphyllazole (3), along with twenty-five known compounds (4\u201328). The structures of isolates were determined by IR, MS, NMR, and UV data analyses. In the anti-diabetic activity screening, (+)isoaltholacton (4), glycoborinine (17), 2\u2032,4\u2032-dihydroxy-4,6\u2032-dimethoxychalcone (24), and flavokawain A (25) simultaneously exhibited inhibition of dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP4) and stimulation of the glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) secretion on the murine intestinal secretin tumor cell line (STC-1).",

            "text": "Diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disease characterized by excessive amounts of blood sugar, leading to a family of diseases that includes hypertension, osteoporosis, retinopathy, and urethritis. Along with the increasing popularity of a sedentary lifestyle, diabetes has gradually become a global epidemic. According to the World Health Organization, approximately 422 million people worldwide suffer from this disease, with up to 1.5 million dying yearly [1]. Owing to the eating habits of East Asians (rice is the staple food), the prevalence of diabetes is much higher than in other areas of the world. It is estimated that 8.5% of adults in Taiwan are afflicted with this disease, and the number of patients is predicted to increase in the future [2]. Anyway, the treatment of many diabetes complications is very costly and has become an economic burden for governments everywhere. Moreover, people with type 2 diabetes are twice as likely to develop liver or pancreatic cancer [3,4]. The leading causes of diabetes are the pancreas being unable to produce enough insulin (juvenile diabetes) or when the body becomes resistant to insulin (adult-onset diabetes). There is no cure for diabetes, but it can be treated and controlled, with treatment being divided into two kinds: subcutaneous insulin injection and oral hypoglycemic drugs. Oral hypoglycemic drugs induce effects that include the promotion of insulin secretion (Diamicron) with an increase in insulin receptor sensitivity (Metformin), \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitors (Acarbose), and dipeptidase-4 (DDP-4) inhibitors (Galvus). These medications often cause unpleasant side effects such as flatulence, diarrhea, hypoglycemia, weight gain, and even liver toxicity [1]. As a result, many people are turning to herbal medicines to treat diabetes [5]. So far, many Traditional Chinese Medicines or folk herbs have shown\nPharmaceuticals 2022, 15, 1543. https://doi.org/10.3390/ph15121543 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceuticals\nPharmaceuticals 2022, 15, 1543 2 of 11\nsignificant effects on lowering blood sugar or reducing the side effects of western medicines. For example, Gastrodia elata water extract can increase the quality of islet \u03b2 cells and reduce cell apoptosis [6]; polyacetylene from Bidens pilosa var. radiata can decrease blood sugar and increase insulin release [7], while the polysaccharides in the flower buds of Lonicera japonica can lower blood sugar [8]. In terms of pure compounds, iminosugars and sugar derivatives were regarded as important antidiabetic agents [9\u201313]. Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is an incretin that can decrease blood sugar levels in a glucose-dependent manner by enhancing insulin secretion; moreover, the action of GLP-1 is preserved in patients with type 2 diabetes, and substantial pharmaceutical research has therefore been directed towards developing GLP-1-based treatment. However, endogenous GLP-1 is rapidly degraded primarily by dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) [14]. In our pre-screenings for anti-diabetes, the extract of Glycosmis pentaphylla (Retz.) DC. was able to simultaneously inhibit DPP-4 and stimulate the secretion of GLP-1 (Figure S1) in a dose-dependent manner (Figure S2), so G. pentaphylla has been proven to have the potential for development of an anti-diabetes drug and was accordingly selected for the following studies. G. pentaphylla, a species of plant belonging to the family Rutaceae, is a shrub or small tree, 1.5\u20135.0 m high, and is widely distributed over India, Malaysia, Southern China, and the Philippine Islands to Vietnam. This plant is a Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) that can strengthen the stomach and relieve pain. In Vietnam, the roots, leaves, and branches of G. pentaphylla are collected year-round to relieve pain, to treat rheumatism, body aches, boils, impetigo, and snakebite. It is also used for postpartum women to cure uterine bleeding, eating indigestion, and abdominal distention [15,16]. Herein, the details of extraction, isolation, structural elucidation, anti-diabetes, and cytotoxicity of isolated compounds are described."

For the partial structure Y, a butyl group attached to an ester group was identified by the COSY correlations of H-1\u2032\u2032\u2032 (\u03b4H 4.02)/H-2\u2032\u2032\u2032 (\u03b4H 1.54)/H-3\u2032\u2032\u2032 (\u03b4H 1.33)/H-4\u2032\u2032\u2032 (\u03b4H 0.93) and the HMBC correlations from H23\u2032 (\u03b4H 2.82 and 3.00) and H-1\u2032\u2032\u2032 to C-4\u2032 (\u03b4C 170.8). Additionally, the HMBC correlations from H-1\u2032\u2032 (\u03b4H 4.19) to C-1\u2032 (\u03b4C 170.5), along with the proton spin system between H-1\u2032\u2032 (\u03b4H 4.19) and H-2\u2032\u2032 (\u03b4H 1.24) established the partial structure Z. These three parts were connected by the HMBC correlations from H-2\u2032 (\u03b4H 4.83) to C-8, C-1\u2032, and C-4\u2032. According to the above 2D NMR analyses, the planar structure of 2 was established (Figure 2). Structurally, 2 showed\nPharmaceuticals 2022, 15, 1543 5 of 11\nsimilar 1H and 13C NMR data to a synthetic compound N-PhAc-D-Asp(OEt)OEt [40]. In addition, the negative optical rotation values of 2 (\u221210) and N-PhAc-D-Asp(OEt)OEt (\u221239) suggested the R configuration of C-2\u2032.\nCompound 3 was isolated as a brown-yellow solid and had a molecular formula of C15H15NO3 based on HRESIMS data (m/z 280.09466 [M + Na]+), accounting for nine degrees of unsaturation. The IR spectrum showed the absorption bands due to hydroxy (3412 cm\u22121), amide (1625 cm\u22121), and phenyl (1512 and 1443 cm\u22121) functional groups. The UV spectrum displayed absorption maxima at 307 and 259 nm; therefore, 3 was defined to have a carbazole skeleton [41]. The 1H NMR spectrum (Table 3) of 3 showed the presence of three singlet protons, one for a phenolic hydroxy group at \u03b4H 7.94 (brs, 2-OH) and the other two for aromatic methines at \u03b4H 6.83 (s, H-1) and 7.67 (s, H-4), as well as a couple of aromatic protons [\u03b4H 6.84 (d, J = 8.5 Hz, H-6) and 7.56 (d, J = 8.5 Hz, H-5)]. The 1H NMR spectrum also displayed a methyl at \u03b4H 2.39 (s, 3-Me), along with two methoxy groups at \u03b4H 3.96 (s, 7-OMe) and \u03b4H 4.00 (s, 8-OMe). The 13C NMR exhibited the signals of fifteen carbons, being twelve aromatic carbons (\u03b4C 96.8, 106.2, 114.3, 116.2, 117.8, 119.5, 121.4, 133.7, 134.0, 139.6, 149.4, and 152.5), one methyl carbon (\u03b4C 16.1), and two methoxy carbon groups (\u03b4C 56.9 and 60.9). The COSY correlation showed one fragment of H-5/H-6. In the HMBC experiment, 3J correlations from \u03b4H 3.96 to \u03b4C 149.4 (C-7) and from \u03b4H 4.00 to \u03b4C 133.7 (C-8) indicated the positions of two methoxy groups. In addition, the correlations from 3-Me to C-2 (\u03b4C 152.5), C-3 (\u03b4C 116.2), and C-4 (\u03b4C 121.4) revealed the position of a methyl group. The HMBC correlations from H-4 to C-5a (\u03b4C 119.5)/C-1a (\u03b4C 139.6) and from H-5 to C-4a (\u03b4C 117.8) were used to construct the pyrrole moiety. Therefore, compound 3 was determined to be 7,8-dimethoxy-3-methyl-9H-carbazol-2-ol, and the trivial name glyphyllazole was given. The anti-diabetic activity of isolated secondary metabolites was evaluated by stimulating the secretion of GLP-1 and inhibiting DPP-4. As shown in Figure 4A, compounds 1, 4, 6, 7, 17, 24, and 25 exhibited stimulatory effects on GLP-1 secretion from murine intestinal secretin tumor cell line (STC-1) at a concentration of 100 \u00b5M. In the acute toxicity evaluation (Figure 4B), except for compound 7, all tested compounds retained the cell viability of STC-1 cells at the concentration of 100 \u00b5M. On the other hand, all tested compounds provided inhibitory effects on DPP-4 enzyme activities (Figure 4C); significantly, compounds 2\u20134, 9, 10, 16\u201318, 20, 24, and 25 demonstrated inhibition rates over 50%.\nPharmaceuticals 2022, 15, 1543 6 of 11\nPharmaceuticals 2022, 15, 1543 7 of 11"

This research led to the isolation of eleven styryl-lactones (4\u201314) and five alkaloids (15\u201319), which proved the genus Glycosmis is a rich source of both alkaloid and styryl-lactone. In anti-diabetic evaluation, compounds 4, 17, 24, and 25 displayed dual activities by stimulating GLP-1 secretion while inhibiting DPP-4 (which can rapidly degrade GLP-1) without cytotoxicity in STC-1 cells. Consequently, our pharmacological data supports G. pentaphylla as being a folk medicine with a hypoglycemic effect.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ph15121543/s1, Figure S1: Preliminary screening of dual biological activities related to modulation of GLP-1 levels; Figure S2: dose-dependent effects of VN016-MeOH; Figures S3\u2013S27: HR-ESI-MS, IR, NMR (1H, 13C, COSY, HSQC, HMBC, and NOESY), and UV spectra of compounds 1\u20133.\nAuthor Contributions: Conception and design of the work: I.-C.H. and Y.-B.C.; purification, analysis and interpretation of the NMR data, structure elucidation, and manuscript preparation: M.T.T.N., Y.-C.L., S.-R.C. and F.-R.C.; bioactive assay: H.-K.L.; critical revision of the manuscript: Y.-B.C.
