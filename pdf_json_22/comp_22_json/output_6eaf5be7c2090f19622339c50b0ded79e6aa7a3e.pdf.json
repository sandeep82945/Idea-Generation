    "abstractText": "Machine learning algorithms are currently used in medicine as a major component of consultation systems. They make diagnostic decisions with quite high levels of accuracy, significantly facilitating thereby the physician\u2019s work. However, some machine learning algorithms are able to solve another no less important task: substantiat ing diagnoses in a language understood by specialists. This paper considers the question of substantiation of diagnoses made using microwave radiometry. Microwave radiometry is a biophysical method for noninvasive investigations based on measurements of internal and surface tissue temperatures from heat emis sion in the microwave and infrared ranges [1, 2]. Recent years have seen results in this area demonstrating the effectiveness of this method in the diagnosis of a number of diseases [2 10]. In particular, a number of studies have proposed the following approach to solving this problem [3 6]. Descriptive mathematical models characterizing the distinguishing features of the temperature fields of patients of different diagnostic classes are developed to support diagnostic decision making. The resulting math ematical models define a corresponding feature space, which is used for classification. The feature space has two functions: first, algorithms trained using these features display high diagnostic accuracy; second, as the features characterize the distinguishing properties of a disease, it becomes possible to analyze and interpret them in a lan guage understood by diagnosticians. The problem of substantiation in machine learning is far from new. However, it is ever more relevant. In partic ular, means of interpreting classifiers using text data [1] and images [11] have been considered by researchers. A variety of general approaches have been discussed [12]. However, processing of quantitative features has its spe cific characteristics. While in processing words and images it is sufficient to highlight points typical of one class or another, numerical data are more naturally ana lyzed using mathematical models, as will be demonstrat ed below. It is therefore appropriate to consider substan tiation using quantitative data separately. Substantiation methods can be divided into two types. Methods of the first type do not use any informa tion from the classifier other than the diagnosis proposed. Substantiation in this case is built on the values of features and their processing by statistical methods. However, this substantiation often fails to correlate with diagnostic algorithms. Methods of the second type use classifier data with subsequent processing. For example, probabilistic information from a na ve Bayesian classifier can be used. In this case, substantiation corresponds to the principles of operation of the classifier, and the specialist can see all the grounds for making the diagnosis. In this work, only algorithms of the second type are considered. Despite the fact that substantiation is discussed in the context of microwave radiometry, the methods pro posed can also be used for diagnosis using other data.

The measurement scheme is shown in Fig. 1. In this scheme, the central point corresponds to the nipple and points 1 8 to the external radius of the breast. T1 and T2 are reference points.\nThus, the database consisted of a set of internal tem peratures (1) and a set of skin temperatures (2):\n(1)\n(2)\nwhere i is the patient number, mw indicates temperatures measured in the microwave range, and ir indicates tem peratures measured in the infrared range. The first sub script is the number of the point at which the temperature was measured; the second subscript is the measurement location: l \u2013 left breast, r \u2013 right breast, p \u2013 reference area.\nThe following characteristic features were identified in the process of analyzing temperature measurements as typical of healthy subjects and generally not of patients without breast cancer: low levels of thermal asymmetry (the difference between temperatures at symmetrical measurement points in right and left breasts); uniform distribution of temperature in the breast, i.e., absence of \u201chot spots\u201d; particular values for the skin to internal temperature ratio.\nThese data were used to construct 62 different fea tures [5]. The resulting feature space was classified using various algorithms. Table 1 shows the results of computa tional experiments. Algorithms were evaluated using two parameters: sensitivity (the proportion of correctly diag nosed patients in the risk group) and specificity (the pro\nportion of correctly diagnosed healthy subjects). This yielded a feature space effective for the diagnosis of breast cancer and providing substantiation in a language under stood by specialists.\nLet us consider these algorithms one by one."

Work reported in [13] describes the process of substantiation of diagnoses by logistical regression. However, we believe that it is important to note some drawbacks and limita tions of the algorithm.\nThe principle of operation of the algorithm is such that the substantiation is based on the values of products cixi. If the product is negative, feature xi is typical of healthy subjects. However, in practice, features often have exclusively positive or negative values. That is, sign(cixi) = const, so that the feature becomes typical of only one diagnosis. To solve this problem, the feature needs to be transformed such that a negative value stays for one diagnosis and a positive value, for another. Such transformation of features requires a separate study and is not addressed here."

Figure 2 presents an example of a decision tree.\nThe key point in substantiation is that the structure of the decision tree is static, so each node can be given a verbal description. For example, in Fig. 2, the first node might correspond to the following descriptions:\n\u2013 if the condition at the node is fulfilled, then \u201cThe value of the feature 1 is normal;\u201d\n\u2013 if the condition at the node is not fulfilled, then \u201cThe value of the feature is 1 is significantly elevated.\u201d\nThe principle of assessing the \u201csignificant elevation\u201d is analogous to the applications of the na ve Bayesian classifier considered below.

In our opinion, it is convenient for substantiation purposes. The formula for computation of the class is:\n(4)\nwhere y\u0302 is the final class; P(y) is the probability of class y, i.e., the proportion of the class in the training set; and P(xi | y) is the conditional probability.\nThus, if P(x2 | sick) > P(x2 | healthy), this means that feature x2 is characteristic of subjects of the \u201csick\u201d class. The substantiation is based on this knowledge.\nThe substantiation algorithm in more details is: 1. For each feature i of [feature 0 to feature m]: 2. If P(feature i | 1) > P(feature i | 2), then: Feature i is characteristic of class 1 (healthy subjects). 3. Else: Feature i is characteristic of class 2 (patients in the risk group). 4. Determine the deviation of feature i from normal. As probabilistic evaluation of the classifier provides no information as to what is specific about the feature for a given class, additional analysis of features is required. One approach to this analysis consists of comparing the value of the feature with its distribution in healthy sub jects. Let us compare the feature with four percentiles (25th, 40th, 60th, and 75th):\n^\n\u2013 if below the 25th percentile, it is significantly below normal;\n\u2013 if between the 25th and 40th percentiles, it is slightly below normal;\n\u2013 if between the 40th and 60th percentiles, it is with in the normal range;\n\u2013 if between the 60th and 75th percentiles, it is slightly greater than normal;\n\u2013 if greater than the 75th percentile, it is significant ly greater than normal.\nThus, substantiation of the type \u201cMean temperature of the left breast is significantly greater than normal, which is characteristic of patients with cancer\u201d is obtained. The number of threshold values and their description can be altered depending on the specific details and context of the subject area."

The feature space will consist of four functions characterizing a number of hypotheses:\n\u2013 insignificant thermal asymmetry (feature F1):\n\u2013 uniform temperature distribution (feature F2):\n\u2013 internal temperature variation. Increased values indicate the presence of a \u201chot spot\u201d (feature F3):\n\u2013 skin temperature variation. Increased values indi cate the presence of a \u201chot spot\u201d (feature F4):\nLet us first consider the na ve Bayesian classifier. The values of the features for a subject undergoing dia gnosis and their conditional probabilities are given in Table 2.\nIt can be seen from Table 2 that the probability of the subject belonging to the class of patients is evidently greater in terms of all features than the probability of belonging to the group of healthy subjects. We will con sider this using the first feature as an example. Figure 3 shows a box and whisker plot. The box at left shows the distribution of values for healthy subjects and the box at right shows values for patients. The dotted line shows the value of the feature in the subject concerned. It can be seen from Fig. 3 that such values for features are encoun tered more frequently in patients. This also applies to other features.\nThus, we obtain the following substantiation accord ing to this algorithm:\n\u2013 all features are typical of the \u201csick\u201d class; \u2013 thermal asymmetry values are significantly greater than normal; \u2013 nipple temperature is slightly greater than normal; \u2013 internal temperature variation is significantly greater than normal; internal \u201chot spots\u201d may be present; \u2013 skin temperature variation is slightly greater than normal. Let us consider a decision tree using the same exam ple. Using the training set, the algorithm constructed a tree structure shown in Fig. 4.\nOn diagnosis, the subject checks conditions from left to right. Thus, grey cells in Fig. 4 are those complying with the corresponding rules for the subject. In the case under consideration, increased thermal asymmetry indi cates that the subject is sick. Feature F3 \u2013 the magnitude of variation in deep temperature \u2013 is not included in the substantiation. This is because the value of 3.85 for this feature is significantly greater than normal. The fact that\nthe value of a feature is below a specified level does not characterize it. It could be either at the normal level or significantly different from normal. However, this piece of information is not used in the diagnosis. It is sufficient for the classifier that the subject has elevated thermal asym metry.\nLet us consider a healthy subject correctly identified by both classifiers. According to the na ve Bayesian clas sifier, the values of each feature are more characteristic of healthy subjects. Comparison of features with normal gave the following results: thermal asymmetry is in the normal range, nipple temperature is slightly below nor mal, internal temperature variation is slightly below nor mal, and skin temperature variation is significantly below normal.\nSubstantiation using a decision tree yielded the fol lowing: thermal asymmetry is not increased, and nipple temperature is low.\nIt is important to note that substantiation using dif ferent algorithms does not guarantee obtaining similar results, as seen in the examples given."

If diagnostic accuracies of all classifiers differ insignificantly, the choice is based on the specific characteristics of the substantiation methods. In one area it might be important to report probabilistic information, while in another it may be\nmore important to have relative statistical information, i.e., increases or decreases in feature values relative to normal.\nIn our opinion, further studies should address other algorithms and the development of methods for substan tiating these algorithms using numerical data. Based on the classification algorithms considered here, we see no opportunity for building a general approach to substan tiation, as substantiation is significantly influenced by the specific characteristics of operation of each algo rithm.\nThis work was funded by the Russian Science Foundation (Project No. 19 19 00349 for the hardware part) and the Foundation for Assistance to Small Inno vative Enterprises in Science and Technology (Project No. 136GRTsTS10 D5/61904 for the artificial intelli gence part)."
