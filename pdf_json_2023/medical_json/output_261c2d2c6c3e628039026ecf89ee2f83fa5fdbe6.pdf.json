    "abstractText": "Brucellosis remains a worldwide zoonotic disease with a serious impact on public health and livestock productivity. Controlling brucellosis in livestock is crucial for limiting human infections in the absence of effective human vaccines. Brucellosis control measures are majorly dependent on rigorous monitoring of disease outbreaks and mass vaccination of livestock. Live attenuated vaccines are available for livestock vaccination that play a vital role in brucellosis control programs in many countries. Even though the existing animal vaccines confer protection against brucellosis, they carry some drawbacks, including their infectivity to humans and interference with sero-monitoring. The available serodiagnostic assays for brucellosis depend on detecting anti-LPS antibodies in the serum. Since diagnosis plays a vital role in controlling brucellosis, developing improved serodiagnostic assays with enhanced specificity, sensitivity and DIVA capability is required. Therefore, it is essential to identify novel antigens for developing improved vaccines and serodiagnostic assays for brucellosis. In the present study, we performed a high throughput immunoprofiling of B. melitensis protein microarray using brucellosis-positive human and animal serum samples. The screening identified several serodominant proteins of Brucella that exhibited common or differential reactivity with sera from animals and humans. Subsequently, we cloned, expressed, and purified ten serodominant proteins, followed by analyzing their potential to develop next-generation vaccines and improved serodiagnostic assays for brucellosis. Further, we demonstrated the protective efficacy of one of the serodominant proteins against the B. melitensis challenge in mice. We found that the seroreactive protein, Dps (BMEI1980), strongly reacted with brucellosis-positive serum samples, but it did not react with sera from B. abortus S19-vaccinated cattle, indicating DIVA capability. A prototype lateral flow assay and indirect ELISA based on Dps protein exhibited high sensitivity, specificity, and DIVA capability. Thus, the present study identified promising candidates for developing improved vaccines and affordable, DIVAcapable serodiagnostic assays for animal and human brucellosis.",

Controlling brucellosis in livestock is crucial for limiting human infections in the absence of effective human vaccines. Brucellosis control measures are majorly dependent on rigorous monitoring of disease outbreaks and mass vaccination of livestock. Live attenuated vaccines are available for livestock vaccination that play a vital role in brucellosis control programs in many countries. Even though the existing animal vaccines confer protection against brucellosis, they carry some drawbacks, including their infectivity to humans and interference with sero-monitoring. The available serodiagnostic assays for brucellosis depend on detecting anti-LPS antibodies in the serum. Since diagnosis plays a vital role in controlling brucellosis, developing improved serodiagnostic assays with enhanced specificity, sensitivity and DIVA capability is required. Therefore, it is essential to identify novel antigens for developing improved vaccines and serodiagnostic assays for brucellosis. In the present study, we\u00a0 performed a high throughput immunoprofiling of B. melitensis protein microarray using brucellosis-positive human and animal serum samples. The screening identified several serodominant proteins of Brucella that exhibited common or differential reactivity with sera from animals and humans. Subsequently, we\u00a0cloned, expressed, and purified ten serodominant proteins, followed by analyzing their potential to develop next-generation vaccines and improved serodiagnostic assays for brucellosis. Further, we\u00a0demonstrated the protective efficacy of one of the serodominant proteins against the B. melitensis challenge in mice. We\u00a0 found that the seroreactive protein, Dps (BMEI1980), strongly reacted with brucellosis-positive serum samples, but it did not react with sera from B. abortus S19-vaccinated cattle, indicating DIVA capability. A prototype lateral flow assay and indirect ELISA based on Dps protein exhibited high sensitivity, specificity, and DIVA capability. Thus, the present study identified promising candidates for developing improved vaccines and affordable, DIVAcapable serodiagnostic assays for animal and human brucellosis.\nKEYWORDS\nBrucella, vaccine, DIVA, immunoprofiling, ELISA, serodominant, diagnostics"

            "text": "Brucellosis is one of the major economically important zoonotic diseases worldwide, which is posing a serious threat to both livestock and human health globally (Mcdermott et\u00a0 al., 2013). Besides its impact on economic loss, brucellosis is also associated with high morbidity in many developing countries, both in humans and animals (Rubach et\u00a0al., 2013). Brucellosis remains endemic in different regions, including Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, Asia, and the Mediterranean basin (Pappas et\u00a0al., 2006). Brucellosis is caused by the Gram-negative facultative intracellular bacteria, Brucella belonging to the class Alphaproteobacteria (Ficht, 2010). Depending on the host preference and pathogenicity, 12 species of Brucella have been identified to date, which can infect domestic, wild, and marine animals (Scholz et\u00a0al., 2016). Four classical Brucella species capable of causing severe brucellosis in humans are B. melitensis, followed by B. abortus, B. suis, and B. canis. Symptoms of brucellosis in animals are abortions, death of weaker offspring, stillbirth, and sterility in males, while in humans, it mainly causes flu-like symptoms with high fever, headache, weakness, and osteoarticular problems (Godfroid et\u00a0 al., 2011). A severe form of brucellosis could be\u00a0fatal with cardiac and neurological complications (Solera et\u00a0al., 1997). Brucellosis in humans is often an occupational hazard directly affecting veterinarians, laboratory technicians, abattoir workers, and farmers (Fiori et\u00a0al., 2000; Agasthya et\u00a0al., 2007). Human transmission could mainly occur through direct contact with infected or aborted animals, consuming contaminated dairy products, and inhaling aerosols (Corbel, 1997). There is no human vaccine for brucellosis, and treatment with multiple antibiotic regimens is the only option to treat human brucellosis. However, antibiotic treatment is challenging due to frequent therapeutic failures and relapses (Ariza et\u00a0al., 2007).\nThe most plausible way to control brucellosis is early disease diagnosis and mass vaccination of susceptible animals. However, diagnosis of brucellosis is challenging, and the available animal vaccines for brucellosis have many disadvantages despite conferring protection (Schurig et\u00a0 al., 2002; Gali\u0144ska and Zag\u00f3rski, 2013). Brucellosis exhibits non-specific clinical manifestations that mimic the symptoms of other infectious or non-infectious diseases (Mantur et\u00a0al., 2007). Direct culturing of Brucella from the tissue specimens is considered the gold standard for diagnosing brucellosis. However, it is often avoided due to its fastidious nature, slow growth, and potential hazard to laboratory personnel (Padilla Poester et\u00a0al., 2010). Therefore, other diagnostic methods have been developed and practiced over time that require no direct contact and do not require expertise and special equipment (Nielsen and Yu, 2010). Therefore, serological detection of brucellosis is one of the most preferred diagnostic tools since this method addressed most of the challenges stated earlier. The serodiagnosis of brucellosis mainly relies on detecting antilipopolysaccharide (LPS) antibodies in the infected serum (Godfroid et\u00a0 al., 2010). However, LPS-based serodiagnostic assays have significant drawbacks, including poor sensitivity, cross-reactivity with several other Gram-negative bacteria, and lack of the capability of Differentiating Infected from Vaccinated Animals (DIVA). Also, the tests fail to detect rough strains of Brucella, viz. B. canis and B. ovis, which lack O-side chains on their LPS (Al Dahouk et\u00a0al., 2003a,b). Hence it is crucial to identify other serodominant antigens of Brucella that are exclusive and capable of addressing major shortcomings of the present serodiagnostic assays.\nAmong the available animal vaccines, S19 and RB51 are the wellrecognized live attenuated vaccines used for cattle (Avila-Calder\u00f3n et\u00a0al., 2013). However, there are many disadvantages associated with these vaccines. The immune response induced by the S19 vaccine is still unclear, and it can induce abortion in pregnant animals. B. abortus S19 vaccine has no DIVA capability, and most importantly, it is highly infectious to humans (Yang et\u00a0al., 2013). RB51, a rough live attenuated strain of B. abortus, has DIVA capability where the vaccinated cattle can be\u00a0differentiated from naturally infected animals using routine serodiagnostic tests (Ashford et\u00a0 al., 2004). However, RB51 is rifampicin-resistant and can cause infection in humans. Subunit vaccines using Brucella recombinant proteins such as L7/L12 ribosomal protein, Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase, and Outer Membrane Lipoproteins (OMPs) OMP16 and OMP19 have been tested for brucellosis (Oliveira and Splitter, 1996; Bae, 1999; Pasquevich et\u00a0 al., 2009; S\u00e1ez et\u00a0 al., 2012). However, no subunit vaccines are currently available to prevent brucellosis in animals and humans. Therefore, the identification and characterization of novel serodominant antigens of Brucella are needed for developing improved vaccines and diagnostic assays for brucellosis. Here, we\u00a0performed a high throughput immunoprofiling of B. melitensis antigens using a protein microarray. The screening identified several serodominant proteins of Brucella that are uniquely present or shared by various host species. Subsequently, we\u00a0performed a detailed characterization of 10 serodominant proteins to assess their utility for developing improved vaccines and serodiagnostic assays. Further, we\u00a0developed a prototype Lateral Flow Assay and indirect ELISA based on one of the serodominant proteins. The assays could detect brucellosis in humans and animals with high sensitivity and specificity and exhibited DIVA capability."

No. 12-MA-0001). The nitrocellulose microarray slides printed with ~3,000 Brucella proteins were analyzed with healthy and brucellosis-positive serum samples. Healthy and brucellosis-positive serum samples were obtained from veterinary diagnostic centers and farms with necessary approvals (Approval number: IBSC/2013/NIAB/0001B). B. abortus S19-vaccinated serum samples were obtained from different villages through government agencies as part of the ongoing brucellosis control program in India. Serum samples were primarily screened for the presence of seropositivity using the Rose Bengal Plate Agglutination Test (RBPT) and the presence of anti-Brucella antibodies was confirmed using OIE-validated, PrioCHECK\u2122 Brucella Ab 2.0 Strip Kit (Applied Biosystems) and IDEXX Brucellosis Serum X2 Ab Test multi-species ELISA for animal sera. NovaLisa\u00ae human IgG and NovaLisa\u00ae human IgM kits (Nova Tec, Germany) for screening human sera. To perform RBPT, 25 \u03bcL of Rose Bengal Brucella antigen and 25 \u03bcL of serum sample were added onto the glass slides and mixed, followed by incubation for 5 min and observation for agglutination. Indirect ELISAs were performed with the collected serum samples as per the manufacturer\u2019s protocols.\nImmunoprobing of protein microarray was performed as per instructions of the manufacturer. Briefly, the printed slides were assembled and blocked with 350 \u03bcL of blocking buffer for 1 h at room temperature with gentle agitation. The kit control or test serum samples were diluted at a ratio of 1:100\u00a0in the pre-incubation solution (20% E. coli lysate in the blocking buffer) and incubated for 30 min before adding onto the microarray slides. Subsequently, 350 \u03bcL of diluted sera were added and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0 C in a humidified airtight container. Next, the slides were washed three times with 1 mL of wash buffer for 5 min each, followed by the addition of 350 \u03bcL of diluted secondary antibody (1:1,000) onto the slides and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The slides were then washed thrice, followed by the addition of 350 \u03bcL of diluted tertiary detection antibody and incubated for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. The slides were given a final wash and air-dried before being scanned with the Axon Genepix scanner (Molecular Devices).\nThe background (true negative) signal was defined as the average signal of the negative control spots on the array. This enabled the comparison of the individual protein signal with the background signal to determine the significant response by protein antigens. The average of replicated spots was measured per sera, and the signal intensities obtained for sera from individual species were analyzed using the Genepix Pro 6.0 software.\nCloning and expression of serodominant proteins of Brucella\nThe genes encoding the identified serodominant protein antigens were amplified from the chromosomal DNA of B. melitensis using respective forward and reverse primers harboring BamH1 and Xho1 enzymes (Table\u00a01). The PCR amplicons were digested with restriction enzymes and gel eluted. The purified PCR products were cloned into BamH1 and Xho1 sites of pET21a(+) in-frame with a 6X Histidine (His) tag at the C-terminus. Subsequently, the clones were confirmed by restriction enzyme digestion and sequencing. The pET21a(+) plasmids harboring the cloned Brucella genes were then introduced into BL21 (DE3) E. coli. To examine the overexpression of Brucella\nproteins, BL21 cells were induced with 1.0 mM Isopropyl \u03b2-D-1thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) for 5 h at 37\u00b0C, followed by harvesting the cells. The cells were lysed in 2X SDS samples buffer, boiled for 10 min, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE.\nPurification of His-tagged serodominant proteins of Brucella\nThe BL21 (DE3) E. coli harboring individual Brucella protein expression plasmids were grown overnight at 37\u00b0C in Lauria Bertini media (LB, Himedia) supplemented with ampicillin (100 \u03bcg/mL; Sigma). This starter culture was inoculated into 1 liter of LB broth in 1/100 dilution and incubated at 37\u00b0C until the OD at 600 nm reached 0.6. The bacterial cultures were then induced with 1.0 mM IPTG and incubated further for 5 h at 37\u00b0C. Subsequently, the bacterial cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000 \u00d7 g at 4\u00b0C and washed once with PBS. Next, the bacterial cells were lysed in 50 mL of sonication buffer containing 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer with 300 mM NaCl and 10 mM imidazole. The cell lysates were clarified by centrifugation at 16,000 \u00d7 g for 20 min at 4\u00b0C, followed by the supernatant collection. Subsequently, the supernatant was passed through the pre-equilibrated column packed with 1 mL of Nickel-NTA Agarose resin (QIAGEN) at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. The Ni-NTA column was then washed with 200 mL of ice-cold wash buffer containing 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer with 300 mM NaCl and 30 mM imidazole. The His-tagged protein immobilized on the Ni-NTA resin, was then eluted with the same buffer containing 300 mM imidazole in various fractions.

Individual animal of each designated group (six mice per group) was intraperitoneally administrated with 40 \u03bcg of purified recombinant protein mixed with Freund\u2019s complete adjuvant (1:1 ratio). Subsequently, the mice were given a booster dose of 20 \u03bcg of protein complexed with Freund\u2019s incomplete adjuvant on day 21 (1:1 ratio). The mice injected with recombinant L7/L12 protein of B. melitensis were considered the positive control group, and the mice injected with adjuvant alone were considered the negative control group (Oliveira et\u00a0al., 1994; Oliveira and Splitter, 1994, 1996; Singh et\u00a0al., 2015). The blood was collected from individual mice from each group on 0, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 45 days after initial immunization through the retro-orbital route. On the 45th day, mice were euthanized, and spleens were removed aseptically to isolate the splenocytes for further immunological assays.\nAnalyzing the humoral and cell-mediated immune responses in immunized mice\nThe antibody response against the purified proteins was estimated by iELISA (indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) in the serum samples collected at various time intervals. Initially, 96-well microtiter plates were coated overnight with respective purified recombinant proteins (100 ng/well) at 4\u00b0C. The wells were then washed thrice with 300 \u03bcL of 1X phosphate buffered saline\u2014tween 20 (PBST) to remove the unbound proteins and blocked for 1 h at room temperature with 100 \u03bcL/ well of 1% BSA prepared in phosphate buffer saline (PBS). The wells were washed thrice with 300 \u03bcL of 1X PBST, followed by adding serum samples (100 \u03bcL/ well) diluted in 1% BSA at a ratio of 1:100 to the respective wells. The plates were incubated at room temperature for 2 h. Subsequently, the wells were washed again as described earlier, followed by incubation with 100 \u03bcL/ well of HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse IgG1 or IgG2a antibody (Novus Biologicals) at a dilution of 1:10,000 for 1 h at 37\u00b0 C. Next, the wells were washed and incubated with 50 \u03bcL of TMB substrate for 10\u201315 min, and the reaction was stopped by adding 50 \u03bcL of 1 N H2SO4. The absorbance of the wells was measured at 450 nm using a microplate reader (PerkinElmer).\nTo analyze the population of CD4+, CD8+, and IFN-\u03b3 producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, the spleens were aseptically harvested from immunized mice, followed by homogenization in sterile PBS. Subsequently, a single-cell suspension was prepared by passing the homogenized samples through 70 \u03bcm cell strainers (BD\nFrontiers in Microbiology 05 frontiersin.org\nBiosciences). The cells were washed twice with 10 mL of PBS, and residual RBCs were lysed using RBC lysis buffer (Sigma) as per the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. The isolated splenocytes were cultured with RPMI 1640 medium containing 10% FBS and 1% penicillinstreptomycin in 6-well plates. Subsequently, the cells in the individual wells were stimulated with 5 \u03bcg/mL of purified recombinant proteins for 48 h at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2. Brefeldin A (5 \u03bcg/mL; Sigma) was added to the cells during the last 4 h of culture. Next, the splenocytes were washed with PBS by centrifugation at 300 \u00d7 g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C and stained with PerCP-conjugated anti-mouse CD8a, PE-conjugated anti-mouse CD4, and APC-conjugated anti-mouse IFN-\u03b3 antibodies (BioLegend) for 1 h at room temperature in the dark. For CD4 and CD8a markers, surface staining was performed while IFN-\u03b3 was stained intracellularly. Cells were fixed using ice-cold acetone and methanol in a 1:1 ratio, followed by permeabilization using 0.01 percent of Triton-X 100 (Sigma) in PBS.

The mice injected with recombinant L7/L12 (BMEI0748) protein were considered the positive control group, while the mice injected with adjuvant alone were considered the negative control group. Forty-five days post-immunization, mice were challenged with B. melitensis 16 M. B. melitensis 16 M was grown in Brucella broth at 37\u00b0 C until the OD reached 1 and resuspended at 2 \u00d7 106 CFUs/ml in 100 \u03bcL of sterile PBS. Subsequently, mice were administrated intraperitoneally (i.p.) with 2 \u00d7 106 CFU of B. melitensis 16 M. The mice were euthanized 2 weeks post-challenge, followed by aseptic removal of spleens for the colony forming unit (CFU) enumeration. The harvested spleens were homogenized individually in 1 mL sterile PBS using 1.0 mm zirconium beads (Benchmark Scientifics) for 60 s in a bead beater (Benchmark Scientifics). The homogenized spleens were 10-fold serially diluted and plated on Brucella agar plates in triplicates. The plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO2, and the number of CFU was counted after 3 days of incubation. The CFU results were represented as the mean log CFU \u00b1 SD per group.\nDevelopment of Dps protein-based serodiagnostic assays\nTo develop Dps protein-based iELISA, the antigen concentration was optimized by performing checkerboard titrations. Various concentrations (10, 5, 2.5, 1.25, 0.625, 0.3125, 0.15625, 0.078125 \u03bcg/ well) of Dps protein were coated in the 96-well microtiter plates and incubated overnight at 4\u00b0 C.

Next, the brucellosis positive and negative sera (1:100 dilution) were added to the wells, and the plates were incubated for 2 h at room temperature. Next, the plates were washed four times with the wash buffer, and 100 \u03bcL of the HRP-conjugated anti-bovine IgG diluted at 1:5,000 (ThermoFisher) was added per well. The plates were incubated for 1 h at room temperature, followed by four washes and the addition of the TMB substrate solution (ThermoFisher). The plates were incubated for 10\u201315 min, followed by reading absorbance at 450 nm using an ELISA reader (PerkinElmer). For assessing the DIVA capability of Dps-based iELISA, the plates were coated with 100 ng of Dps protein per well, followed by iELISA as described above using serum samples collected at 21, 45, and 90 days post-B. abortus S19 vaccination. To evaluate the efficiency of Dps-based iELISA, human and cattle serum samples were screened using Dps-based iELISA, and the results were compared with that of commercially available, validated iELISA for human (NovaLisa) and cattle (PrioCheck) and RBPT. Brucella-culture positive/negative sera (bovine and mouse) and OIE-brucellosis positive/negative bovine reference serum samples were also screened using the Dps-based iELISA.\nY. enterocolitica O:9 immune and healthy rabbit serum samples were obtained from the Translational Research Platform for Veterinary Biologicals (TRPVB). Dps-based iELISA was performed with Y. enterocolitica O:9 immune and healthy rabbit serum samples as described before and HRP-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG at 1:5000 (CST) dilution was used as the secondary antibody. To perform iELISA with Salmonella immune serum, the sera were raised in mice against formalin-inactivated S. typhimurium. In brief, 6\u20138 weeks old female BALB/c mice were injected with 100 \u03bcL of inactivated S. typhimurium (1 \u00d7 105) intraperitoneally. Serum samples were collected on day 21, followed by performing Dps-based iELISA as described before. The HRP-conjugated anti-mouse IgG at a dilution of 1:5,000 (Novus Biologicals) was used as the secondary antibody for iELISA.\nTo develop the prototype LFA, purified Dps protein and biotinylated bovine serum albumin (Abcam) were dispensed (1.5 mg/ mL) as test and control lines, respectively on the nitrocellulose membrane (mdi Membrane Technologies) using a flow dispenser (mdi Membrane Technologies). The protein G-gold (Abcam) and streptavidin-gold (Abcam) conjugates were mixed in a 4:1 ratio and coated on the pre-treated conjugate pad. Various components of LFA were assembled with the help of commercial source. To evaluate the prototype LFA, the serum samples (10 \u03bcL) were applied to the sample applicator port, followed by 200 \u03bcL of chase buffer to facilitate the sample migration toward the conjugate pad. Antibodies in the sample bound to the protein G-gold continue traveling up the nitrocellulose membrane. Anti-Dps antibodies in the samples were then bound to the Dps protein on the test line, producing a visible test line signal by an accumulation of gold particles on the test line. Streptavidin-gold conjugate bound to BSA-biotin on the control line produced a signal irrespective of the presence of anti-Dps antibodies in the samples. The absorbent pad absorbed excess liquid. The individual test was considered positive when a clear test line was visible or negative when only a control line was observed. To evaluate the LFA, 10 pooled brucellosis positive/negative/S19-vaccinated field serum samples of cattle, goat and humans were tested.\nThe formula used for the evaluation is given below: Sensitivity = a/(a + c) \u00d7 100.

The commercially available full proteome microarray that contains ~3,000 proteins of B. melitensis was used for immunoprofiling. The brucellosis-positive serum samples that harbor antibodies against the serodominant proteins of Brucella reacted with the respective proteins on the microarray (Figure\u00a01A). The seroreactive proteins were detected by scanning the immunoprobed protein microarrays. The healthy human serum samples did not cross-react with any Brucella proteins on the array.

Immunoprobing with brucellosis-positive serum samples of\nhuman, cattle, and goat detected various proteins on the array (Figure\u00a01B).

The antigens with a signal intensity of more than two standard deviations over the mean of signal intensities from negative controls were defined as serodominant antigens (Liang et\u00a0 al., 2010). The high-ranking serodominant proteins from individual species are illustrated as a heat map (Figure\u00a01C).

To examine this, we\u00a0 analyzed the immunogenicity of purified Brucella proteins in mice. The mice were immunized with serodominant proteins, followed by the collection of blood samples at various days postimmunization (Figure\u00a03A). We\u00a0used the immunogenic protein of Brucella, L7/L12 (BMEI0748) as the positive control as this antigen has been reported to induce a protective immune response in\nFrontiers in Microbiology 07 frontiersin.org\nbrucellosis (Oliveira et\u00a0al., 1994; Oliveira and Splitter, 1994, 1996; Singh et\u00a0 al., 2015). The mice were sacrificed at the end of the experiment, followed by analyzing various cell populations to determine the induction of cell-mediated immune responses. Serum samples collected on different days were analyzed for IgG1 and IgG2a levels to estimate the humoral immune response induced by these\nFIGURE\u00a01 (A) A graphical abstract summarizing the identification process of serodominant protein antigens of Brucella.

We\u00a0observed a high antibody titer in the immunized mice, indicating that these antigens are potent inducers of the humoral immune response. IgG1 and IgG2a are the markers of Th2 and Th1 responses, respectively, in mice where the Th1 response is reported to be\u00a0 important for protection against brucellosis (Golding et\u00a0al., 2001; Yingst and Hoover, 2003; Skendros et\u00a0al., 2011; Vitry et\u00a0al., 2014). We\u00a0observed a high titer of IgG2a antibody with BMEI1980, BMEI0063, BMEI0856, BMEI0916, BMEII1048, and BMEI0855 indicating a Th1 specific response (Figure\u00a03C). In contrast, the Brucella proteins, BMEI1513, BMEI0748, BMEI1390, and BMEII0154 exhibited induction of IgG1 response, suggesting a Th2 immune response (Figure\u00a03B).\nTABLE\u00a02 The list of identified serodominat proteins that reacted with human sera.\nPeptidoglycan-associated lipoprotein BMEI0340\nTransporter BMEI1890\nProtease Do BMEI1330\nBranched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase subunit E2 BMEII0746\nIsopropylmalate isomerase large subunit BMEI0157\nImmunogenic protein BMEI0536\nHypothetical protein BMEI0916\nPeriplasmic oligopeptide-binding protein precursor BMEII0735\nHypothetical protein BMEI1060\nHypothetical protein BMEI0179\nHypothetical protein BMEI0368\nATP-dependent protease ATP-binding subunit HslU BMEI2048\nPreprotein translocase subunit SecG BMEI0847\nNADH dehydrogenase subunit E BMEI1154\nPyruvate dehydrogenase subunit beta BMEI0855\nVirB8 BMEII0032\nHypothetical protein BMEI0563\nOuter membrane lipoprotein BMEI0135\nDihydrolipoamide succinyltransferase BMEI0141\nFlagellar hook-associated protein FlgL BMEII0161\nHypothetical protein BMEI0178\nHypothetical protein BMEI0805\nHypothetical protein BMEI0051\nDNA gyrase subunit A BMEI0884\nThiol:disulfide interchange protein DsbA BMEI1440\nTranscriptional regulatory protein MUCR BMEI1364\nMolecular chaperone GroEL BMEII1048\nHypothetical protein BMEI1077\nCOML competence lipoprotein BMEI0587\nPeriplasmic dipeptide transport protein precursor BMEII0217\nDNA starvation/stationary phase protection protein Dps BMEI1980\nHigh-affinity zinc uptake system protein ZNUA BMEII0178\nCobT protein BMEI0050\nDeoxyuridine 5\u2032-triphosphate nucleotidohydrolase BMEI0358\nHypothetical protein BMEII0153\nOuter membrane lipoprotein BMEII0017\nLipoprotein NlpD BMEI1079\n50S ribosomal protein L7/L12 BMEI0748\nTransporter BMEI2053\nPreprotein translocase subunit SecD/SecF BMEI0680\nFrontiers in Microbiology 09 frontiersin.org\nTABLE\u00a03 The list of identified serodominant proteins that reacted with goat sera.\nTransporter BMEI1890\n30S ribosomal protein S16 BMEI0227\nHypothetical protein BMEI1866\nImmunogenic protein BMEI0536\nHypothetical protein BMEI0810\nProtease Do BMEI0613\nType I\u00a0restriction-modification enzyme S subunit BMEII0452\nPreprotein translocase subunit SecA BMEI0121\nHlyD family secretion protein BR_1060\nPeriplasmic oligopeptide-binding protein precursor BMEII0735\nNucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase BMEI0920\nHypothetical protein BMEI1847\nHypothetical protein BMEII0073\nFlagellin BMEII0150\nHypothetical protein BMEI0699\nCell surface protein BMEI1872\nRiboflavin synthase subunit beta BMEII0589\nSensory transduction histidine kinase BMEI0370\n2-oxoisovalerate dehydrogenase subunit alpha BMEII0748\nATP-dependent protease ATP-binding subunit HslU BMEI2048\nATPase BMEI1370\nCystine-binding periplasmic protein precursor BMEII0601\nMultidrug resistance protein A BMEII1118\nLeu/Ile/Val-binding protein precursor BMEII0103\nPreprotein translocase subunit SecG BMEI0847\nacyl-CoA hydrolase BMEI0503\nLemA protein BMEI0228\nElectron transfer flavoprotein-ubiquinone oxidoreductase BMEI1320\nNADH dehydrogenase subunit E BMEI1154\nHypothetical protein BMEII0924\nSugar-binding protein BMEII0755\nCatalase BMEII0893\nHypothetical protein BMEI0563\nHypothetical protein BMEII0231\nThioredoxin BMEII0401\ntrbJ protein BR_A0368\nOuter membrane lipoprotein BMEI0135\nMonovalent cation/H+ antiporter subunit G BMEII0765\nHypothetical protein BMEI0973\nColicin V production protein BMEI1487\nMolecular chaperone DnaJ BMEI1513\nCysteine synthase A BMEI0101\nAlpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase BMEII1076\nNon-motile and phage-resistance protein BMEI0417\nABC transporter substrate-binding protein BMEII0338\nSuperoxide dismutase (Cu-Zn) BMEII0581\nCopper-containing nitrite reductase precursor BMEII0988\nHemagglutinin BMEII0717\nHypothetical protein BMEI1000\nHypothetical protein BMEI0178\n(Continued)\nFrontiers in Microbiology 10 frontiersin.org"

The protection\nefficiency of a vaccine candidate is determined by the significant reduction in the number of bacterial colonies in the spleen of immunized mice compared to the control. The mice immunized with BMEI0856 showed a significant reduction of CFU, indicating the protective effect of this protein against the B. melitensis challenge (Figure\u00a03G). As reported previously, L7/L12 also exhibited protective efficacy against challenge with B. melitensis. Interestingly, BMEI0856 immunized mice showed lesser bacterial load compared to L7/L12.

We\u00a0analyzed the immunoreactivity of purified Dps protein with serum samples from animals and humans. The immunoblots of Dps protein were probed with healthy sera or brucellosis-positive human, goat, cattle, or B. abortus S19-vaccinated cattle serum samples. The Dps protein was efficiently detected by brucellosis-positive serum samples from both animals and humans (Figures\u00a05A,B). Further, we\u00a0found that Dps protein failed to react with the serum sample from B. abortus S19-vaccinated cattle. To confirm the differential recognition of Dps protein, we\u00a0performed immunoprobing of various concentrations of Dps protein with the sera from naturally infected or B. abortus S19-vaccinated cattle (Figure\u00a05C). In agreement with previous data, the serum samples from B. abortus S19-vaccinated cattle did not detect Dps protein. We\u00a0used LPS of E. coli and B. abortus as the negative and positive controls, respectively, for the immunoblots.

It is possible that the Dps protein was not expressed in the B. abortus S19 vaccine strain, resulting in a lack of antibody production against this protein in the vaccinated animals. To examine this, we\u00a0 performed immunoblotting with total lysates of B. abortus and B. abortus S19 strain. The membrane was probed with an anti-Dps antibody, which can detect the endogenous level of Dps protein. We\u00a0used the reported serodominant protein, L7/L12, as the positive control. We\u00a0observed a diminished level of Dps protein in the B. abortus S19 strain in comparison to the wild-type B. abortus (Figure\u00a0 5E). In contrast, we\u00a0observed a uniform expression of L7/L12 protein in B. abortus and B. abortus S19 vaccine strains (Figure\u00a05E).\nDps protein-based serodiagnostic assays exhibit DIVA capability and detect brucellosis in animals and humans\nSince both the animal and human sera efficiently recognized Dps protein, we\u00a0 wished to develop a lateral flow assay (LFA) and an indirect ELISA (iELISA) based on this protein. Toward developing iELISA, we\u00a0determined the optimal concentration of Dps protein using the checkerboard titration assays (Figures\u00a0 6A,B). Various concentrations of Dps protein were titrated against brucellosispositive or negative human serum samples. The positivity of the serum samples was determined by the mean OD greater than two standard deviations over the mean OD of the negative controls (Fran\u00e7a et\u00a0al.,\n2014). The cut-off value calculated for human serum samples was 0.45. The assay indicated that 1 \u03bcg/mL of Dps protein was optimal for developing the iELISA. To develop the assay further, various blocking agents and antibody dilutions were optimized. One percent BSA was found suitable for testing human serum samples, whereas 3% BSA was optimal for cattle serum samples. HRP-conjugated anti-bovine or anti-human antibody at a dilution of 1:5,000 was found optimal for Dps-based iELISA.\nNext, the efficiency of Dps-based iELISA was compared with that of commercially available LPS-based iELISA or with RBPT. The validated LPS-based iELISA (NovaLisa) can detect brucellosis with human serum samples. Among the human serum samples tested, 26 sera were found to be\u00a0positive by Dps protein-based iELISA, and 25 samples were positive by commercial iELISA. In contrast, only 14 samples were found positive by RBPT. A total of 195 samples were declared negative by all three tests. Both ELISAs had an agreement with 25 samples. Out of 207 samples, which were negative with RBPT, 11 samples were found positive by both ELISAs. In the case of one sample, there was a disagreement between the two ELISA (Table\u00a07). The higher number of positive samples in iELISA than RBPT may suggest enhanced sensitivity of ELISA. Our in-house validation assays using human serum samples indicated 99% sensitivity and 98% specificity for the Dps-based iELISA (Table\u00a08).\nWe have also evaluated the seroreactivity of Dps-based iELISA using Brucella-culture positive/negative bovine and mouse sera and OIE-brucellosis positive/negative bovine reference serum samples (Supplementary Figures\u00a04A,B). The assay indicated the detection of anti-Dps antibodies in the brucellosis positive reference serum samples. To examine the DIVA capability of iELISA, cattle serum samples were collected on various days post B. abortus S19 vaccination\nanti-CD4, -CD8 and -IFN-\u03b3 antibodies conjugated with fluorescent dyes, followed by FACS analysis.

The OD values of the known positive, negative, and B. abortus S19-vaccinated serum samples were estimated, and the cut-off values were derived as described before. All the B. abortus S19-vaccinated serum samples were seropositive with LPS-based iELISA, whereas these sera showed OD values similar to negative controls with Dps-based iELISA (Figures\u00a06C,D). The assay indicated that the Dps-based iELISA could differentiate B. abortus S19-vaccinated from naturally infected cattle.\nThe LPS-based serodiagnostic assays for brucellosis have been reported to cross-react with the serum samples of animals infected with Y. enterocolitica O:9, S. typhimurium, and E. coli (Al Dahouk et\u00a0 al., 2003a). Therefore, we\u00a0 examined the cross-reactivity of Dps-based iELISA with Yersinia and Salmonella immune sera. We\u00a0did\nnot observe any significant cross-reactivity with Dps-based iELISA against the Yersinia or Salmonella immune serum samples (Figures\u00a0 6E,F). To further confirm the experimental data, we\u00a0 performed an immunoblot with whole cell lysates of S. typhimurium, E. coli or B. abortus, followed by probing the membrane with Brucella anti-Dps antibody. The anti-Dps antibody did not cross-react with any proteins in the lysates of S. typhimurium or E. coli other than detecting the endogenous Dps protein in the B. abortus lysate (Supplementary Figure S5). Collectively, our experimental data indicate that Dps-based iELISA can specifically detect brucellosis positive sera samples without showing any cross-reactivity.\nNext, we\u00a0 developed a prototype LFA using Dps protein for pen-site application of this serodiagnostic assay. In the prototype\nFIGURE\u00a05 Seroreactivity of Dps protein with sera from human and animals.

            "text": "Brucellosis is an emerging zoonotic disease that seriously impacts human health and livestock productivity (Mcdermott et\u00a0al., 2013; Rubach et\u00a0al., 2013). The intracellular niche and the ability to subvert host immune responses enable Brucella to cause chronic infection in the host, making treatment options often difficult (Solera et\u00a0al., 1997; Godfroid et\u00a0al., 2011). Since there is no human vaccine for brucellosis, controlling the disease in animals through mass vaccination is the only viable option to limit human infections. Early detection and culling/quarantine of infected animals are crucial for controlling the spread of brucellosis in livestock. However, the major drawbacks of available animal vaccines and serodiagnostic assays pose serious hurdles in brucellosis control programs in various countries (Schurig et\u00a0al., 2002; Gali\u0144ska and Zag\u00f3rski, 2013). Therefore, it is essential to identify and characterize novel serodominant antigens of Brucella to address major shortcomings of presently available vaccines and serodiagnostic assays.\nCompared to other antigens, serodominant proteins are promising targets for developing improved diagnostic assays and vaccines. Once identified, these proteins can be\u00a0expressed and purified from various expression systems making the process safer and cost-effective as large-scale culturing of the infectious pathogens and extraction of the antigens are not required. Serodiagnostic assays based on these recombinant proteins can provide higher sensitivity, specificity, and DIVA capability (Chaudhuri et\u00a0al., 2010; Thavaselvam et\u00a0al., 2010). These recombinant serodominant proteins could also serve as ideal\ncandidates for developing safe and efficient vaccines for animal and human applications. Recent advancements in genomics and proteomics techniques permit large-scale screening for identifying serodominant proteins of pathogenic microorganisms (Liang et\u00a0al., 2010). We\u00a0used a full-proteome microarray of B. melitensis for the identification of serodominant proteins of Brucella from various host species. The immunoprofiling of B. melitensis proteins on the microarray yielded 202 potentially immunogenic proteins uniquely present or shared by multiple host species. Our analysis picked up many proteins of Brucella, such as BP26, ZunA, Cu-Zn SOD, Omp19, and Omp10, which were previously identified as serodominant and subsequently were used as candidate antigens for the development of either vaccines or serodiagnostic assays (Kim et\u00a0al., 2004; Pasquevich et\u00a0 al., 2009; S\u00e1ez et\u00a0 al., 2012; Fran\u00e7a et\u00a0 al., 2014). These findings indicate the reliability of the experimental data generated in the present study. Subsequently, we\u00a0evaluated the vaccine and diagnostic potential of 10 high-ranking immunogenic antigens, excluding previously reported well-characterized proteins.\nWe cloned, overexpressed, and purified the selected serodominant proteins, followed by analyzing their immunogenic potential to induce Th1 immune response against brucellosis in mice. Th1 type cellular immune response mainly involves generating IFN-\u03b3 producing T-cell populations, antigen-specific cytotoxic CD8+ T-cells, and a high titer of IgG2a is reported to confer protection in brucellosis (Golding et\u00a0al., 2001; Yingst and Hoover, 2003; Skendros et\u00a0al., 2011; Vitry et\u00a0al., 2014). Mice immunized with BMEI1980, BMEI1390, BMEI0063, BMEI0856, BMEI0916, BMEII1048, BMEI0855, BMEII0154, and BMEI0748, showed higher percentage of CD4+, CD8+ cell population or IFN-\u03b3 producing CD4+, CD8+ cell population. Thus, suggesting a significant induction of Th1-type immune response. These proteins induced a high titer of IgG2a antibody, comparable to the response induced by the reported vaccine candidate, L7/L12 (Oliveira et\u00a0al., 1994; Oliveira and Splitter, 1994, 1996; Singh et\u00a0al., 2015). Switching antibody response to the IgG2a type could facilitate antibodymediated phagocytosis of extracellular Brucella, which can enhance bacterial clearance (Ko and Splitter, 2003; Vitry et\u00a0 al., 2014). The identified serodominant protein pyruvate dehydrogenase complex dihydrolipoamide acetyltransferase (BMEI0856) is a part of the Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex, which is reported to be\u00a0involved in protein synthesis during Brucella stress response (Teixeira-Gomes et\u00a0 al., 2000; Foth et\u00a0 al., 2005) The D-ribose-binding-periplasmic protein precursor (BMEI1390) is one of the sugar-binding proteins that help in sugar uptake to synthesize complex cell constituents (Wagner et\u00a0al., 2002). The DNA starvation stationary phase protection (Dps, BMEI1980) is a part of the stress response system that binds non-specifically to DNA during oxidative stress (Martinez and Kolter, 1997; Roop\u00a0 2nd et\u00a0 al., 2003). BMEII1048 encodes the molecular chaperonin, GroEL, a member of the heat shock protein family that plays a vital role in the structure and folding of other proteins (Abbady et\u00a0al., 2012). GroEL has been reported to be\u00a0a potent inducer of host immune responses (Leclerq et\u00a0al., 2002). The 50S ribosomal protein L7/L12 (BMEI0748) is associated with translation initiation and is critical for ribosomal translocation (Carlson et\u00a0 al., 2017). The protective efficiency of this serodominant protein has been confirmed earlier, therefore L7/L12 was employed as the positive control in this study. BMEI0855 gene encodes the pyruvate dehydrogenase subunit beta of the pyruvate dehydrogenase protein complex that catalyzes the overall conversion of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA and CO2.

BMEII0154 codes for MotB family protein that is a part of the stator of the flagellar motor protein complex. MotB mutations have been studied earlier to determine their vital role in establishing chronic infection (Fretin et\u00a0al., 2005). The genes BMEI0916 and BMEI0063 code for hypothetical proteins where the functions of these proteins are yet to be\u00a0established.\nOur experimental data suggest that these serodominant proteins are potential candidates for developing next-generation vaccines for brucellosis. To validate this, a challenge study was performed to examine the protective efficiency of the serodominant proteins against B. melitensis in mice. The serodominant protein, BMEI0856 that induced a Th1 response conferred a significant level of protection against challenge with B. melitensis. The protective efficacy of BMEI0856 has appeared to be\u00a0superior to that of the reported Brucella vaccine candidate, L7/L12. Even though we\u00a0observed induction of Th1 type response by BMEI0063, it did not confer any significant level of protection against B. melitensis challenge compared to BME0856 and L7/L12. The serodominant protein, BMEI1513, that induced a Th2 type response failed to confer any protection highlighting the importance of Th1 type immune response for clearance of Brucella. The preliminary data obtained from the in vivo challenge study indicate that BMEI0856 could serve as an ideal candidate for developing a next-generation vaccine for brucellosis. Our future experiments will examine the utility of other serodominant proteins for vaccine development.\nAntigens that induce a robust antibody response can serve as ideal candidates for developing improved serodiagnosis assays. We\u00a0evaluated the seroreactivity of purified serodominant proteins by immunoblotting with brucellosis-positive and negative serum samples from cattle and humans. Even though all the tested proteins reacted with brucellosis-positive serum samples with different efficiency, Dps protein exhibited strong seroreactivity with both animal and human sera. We\u00a0did not observe any cross-reactivity of Dps protein with serum samples from healthy animals or humans. The Dps protein is a part of Proteobacteria\u2019s \u03c3E1 stress response system and is reported to play a crucial role in the stress survival and chronic infection of Brucella (Kim et\u00a0al., 2013). A recent study demonstrated that Brucella secretes Dps protein in the infected macrophages that mediate ferritinophagy activation and host cell necrosis to facilitate the egress and bacterial dissemination (Hop et\u00a0al., 2023). This may release Dps into the circulatory system to generate a potent antibody response in the Brucella-infected host.\nA DIVA-capable serodiagnostic assay is essential when a wholecell vaccine is used for administration. The principle of DIVA is eliciting an antibody response against the pathogen that is different from the response induced due to vaccination. Thus, distinguishing an infected animal from the vaccinated in a serological analysis is based on the antigen lacking in the vaccine candidate. DIVA vaccines may lack one or more immunological protein antigens that are present in the natural form of a pathogen. A previous study had identified many proteins, including Dps that were differentially expressed in the B. abortus and B. abortus S19 vaccine strain (Lamontagne et\u00a0al., 2009). However, no experimental validation of this data was performed to examine the serodiagnostic potential of Dps protein for developing improved sero-monitoring assays with DIVA capability. Since our screening also identified Dps protein and showed robust immunogenicity in mice, we\u00a0sought to examine its potential to serve as a candidate for developing improved serodiagnostic assays. Detailed\nimmunoprobing of purified Dps protein with serum samples from naturally infected or B. abortus S19-vaccinated cattle indicated that Dps exhibits DIVA capability where it reacted only with the sera from naturally infected cattle and not with the serum samples from B. abortus S19-vaccinated animals. Further, no seroreactivity was observed when Dps protein was probed with sera from cattle after various days of B. abortus S19 vaccination. These data imply that the S19 vaccine strain of B. abortus may not express Dps protein. However, the Dps gene is present on chromosome I\u00a0of B. abortus S19, similar to its parent strain, B. abortus (Pajuaba et\u00a0 al., 2012). Therefore, we\u00a0examined whether Dps protein is expressed in the B. abortus S19 strain. Our subsequent immunoblotting experiments indicated a minimal expression of Dps protein in the B. abortus S19 strain compared to the wild-type B. abortus. Since the expression of Dps is low in the B. abortus S19 strain, it appears that the antibody response in the vaccinated animals is undetectable, which provides the DIVA capability.\nGiven that Dps protein reacted with brucellosis-positive serum samples from animals and humans and exhibited DIVA capability, we\u00a0wished to develop Dps-based serodiagnostic assays. A prototype LFA based on the Dps protein efficiently detected brucellosis-positive serum samples from animals and humans indicating its utility in point-of-care applications. Further, the LFA could differentiate vaccinated from naturally infected cattle. Toward developing the iELISA, we\u00a0 optimized various assay parameters such as Dps concentration, blocking agent, and optimal serum and secondary antibody dilutions. Subsequently, we\u00a0prepared the iELISA kits and compared their efficiency with the commercially available brucellosis detection kits. An in-house assay validation with human sera samples showed 99% sensitivity and 98% specificity for the Dps protein-based iELISA. Further, the Dps-based iELISA and LFA showed DIVA capability with bovine serum samples where the vaccinated cattle were assay negative compared to the naturally infected animals. The crossreactivity with the immune sera of Gram-negative bacteria, especially Y. enterocolitica O:9, S. typhimurium, and E. coli is a major drawback of existing LPS-based serodiagnostic assays for brucellosis. Our experimental data indicate that Dps-based iELISA does not exhibit any cross-reactivity with the immune sera of Y. enterocolitica O:9 or S. typhimurium. Collectively, our studies suggest that Dps-based LFA and iELISA could serve as ideal diagnostic tools for brucellosis control programs where assays with high sensitivity, specificity, and DIVA capabilities are required."
