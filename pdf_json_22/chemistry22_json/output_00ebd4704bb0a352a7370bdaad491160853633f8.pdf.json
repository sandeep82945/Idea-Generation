    "abstractText": "The main reasons for the limited clinical efficacy of the platinum(II)-based agent cisplatin include drug resistance and significant side effects. Due to their better stability, as well as the possibility to introduce biologically active ligands in their axial positions constructing multifunctional prodrugs, creating platinum(IV) complexes is a tempting strategy for addressing these limitations. Another strategy for developing chemotherapeutics with lower toxicity relies on the ability of nanoparticles to accumulate in greater quantities in tumor tissues through passive targeting. To combine the two approaches, three platinum(IV) conjugates based on a cisplatin scaffold containing in the axial positions derivatives of caffeic and ferulic acid were prepared and loaded into SBA15 to produce the corresponding mesoporous silica nanoparticles (MSNs). The free platinum(IV) conjugates demonstrated higher or comparable activity with respect to cisplatin against different human breast cancer cell lines, while upon immobilization, superior antiproliferative activity with markedly increased cytotoxicity (more than 1000-fold lower IC50 values) compared to cisplatin was observed. Mechanistic investigations with the most potent conjugate, cisplatin-diacetyl caffeate (1), and the corresponding MSNs (SBA-15|1) in a 4T1 mouse breast cancer cell line showed that these compounds induce apoptotic cell death causing strong caspase activation. In vivo, in BALB/c mice, 1 and SBA-15|1 inhibited the tumor growth while decreasing the necrotic area and lowering the",

            "text": "Caffeic acid (CA) and ferulic acid (FA) belong to the most common phenolic acids, naturally occurring in fruits, grains, vegetables, spices, tea and coffee [1]. Apart from the key functions that these secondary plant metabolites exhibit on plant growth, development and defence, they are also found to have highly beneficial effects on humans. They are known for being potent natural antioxidants that are important for a variety of biological and pharmacological processes, such as cancer prevention, inflammation reduction, bacterial and viral infections prevention, blood clotting prevention, liver protection and many others [2\u20138]. The antioxidant properties of these phenolic acids are accredited to\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3767. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano12213767 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3767 2 of 23\ntheir chemical structure which includes one (ferulic acid) or two (caffeic acid) free phenolic hydroxyl groups and a double bond in the aliphatic chain enabling the formation of a phenoxy radical stabilized through resonance. In addition to the free radical scavenging via hydrogen atom donation [9], these phenolic acids are also found to modulate enzymatic activity, affect signal transduction as well as activate transcription factors and gene expression. As an example, alkyl esters of caffeic and ferulic acid are found to demonstrate significant inhibition on the activity of cyclooxygenase enzymes (COX-1 and COX-2) [10\u201313] responsible for the formation of key proinflammatory mediators. Additionally, COX-2 is overexpressed in a variety of tumors [14], making it a desirable target for the creation of anticancer medications. Therefore, in the past decade, these phenolic acids have attracted extensive attention as potential chemopreventive and chemotherapeutic agents. In that sense, multiple groups have pointed to the ability of caffeic acid and its derivatives to inhibit the growth of colon cancer [15\u201318], express anti-hepatocellular carcinoma activity [19], suppress the cancer cell proliferation in the human HT-1080 fibrosarcoma cell line [20] as well as human cervical cancer cells (HeLa and Me-180) [21] and reduce not only the growth of breast cancer, but also the ability of the breast cancer MCF-7 cells to migrate [22,23] which is a crucial factor for cancer metastasis. Ferulic acid as well has been found to have tumor-suppression potential in colon and breast cancers [4,24]. Additionally, both caffeic and ferulic acid have been found to increase the therapeutic efficacy of known anticancer drugs or lower the drug-related side effects. In this regard, the combined therapy involving caffeic acid and paclitaxel has been shown to have synergistic anticancer activity on H1299 lung cancer cells leading to enhanced apoptosis in vitro and in vivo [25]. Furthermore, caffeic acid elevates the antitumor effect of metformin in HTB-34 human metastatic cervical carcinoma cells [26] and increases the susceptibility of gastric cancer cells to cisplatin and doxorubicin [27]. Synergistic effects are also found applying cisplatin and caffeic acid in combination resulting in apoptotic mode of cell death in human cervical cancer cells [28]. A very interesting finding has been made by Sirota et al. who have discovered that in ovarian carcinoma cell lines the timing of caffeic acid treatment determines whether they become cisplatin-sensitive or -resistant [29]. Their findings demonstrate that preincubation with caffeic acid before treatment with cisplatin resulted in acquired resistance to cisplatin and decreased DNA binding, whereas simultaneous treatment with cisplatin and caffeic acid can increase cytotoxicity of cisplatin and platinum binding to nuclear DNA [29]. Based on all these findings and bearing in mind the different pharmacokinetic profiles of phenolic acids and cisplatin, including rising uncertainties whether these agents can reach the tumors within the required time frame in vivo, we have designed conjugates that combine the two agents into a single platinum(IV) prodrug. In this way, together with the molecules of the platinum component, the molecules of the respective phenolic acid can also be delivered into the tumor cells. Upon intracellular activation of these prodrugs via 2-electron reduction and protonation, the two moieties can be released and together carry out their biological functions in a synergistic manner [30]. Another reason which makes this approach attractive is that the coordinatively saturated platinum(IV) complexes are more stable than platinum(II) complexes, such as cisplatin, thus preventing its premature activation occurring by hydrolysis of the labile platinum chlorido ligand bonds, which is associated with many of its drawbacks such as the severe side effects, fast detoxification and innate or acquired resistance [31,32]. In an effort to create chemotherapeutics with lower toxicity, we have also used an SBA-15 mesoporous silica as nanocarrier for the platinum(IV) conjugates, aiming to take advantage of the accumulation of nanoparticles in tumor tissues through the passive enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect [33]. An additional advantage of this strategy is the possibility to further protect the drug from premature interaction with biomolecules on the way to cancer cells as well as provide tailorable drug release. The mesoporous silica SBA-15 material was chosen as a drug delivery vehicle because it is nontoxic to cells [34] and it has advantageous properties, including high pore volume with tuneable nanoscale pores as well as large surface area [35\u201337]. The properties of the inorganic mesoporous silica materi-\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3767 3 of 23\nals that make them interesting for biomedical applications, especially as nanoplatforms for drug delivery, have been highlighted in several reviews in the recent years [38\u201344]. The use of SBA-15 as a cisplatin carrier in earlier studies has been associated with increased cytotoxicity in leukemic cells [45], a twenty-fold greater antiproliferative effect in HT-29 colon cancer cells [46] and activation of pathways that change the phenotype of cancer cells (i.e., melanoma B16 tumor cells differentiate into senescent cells) [47]. Formerly reported SBA-15 nanoparticles loaded with platinum(IV) conjugates have also demonstrated very high antiproliferative activity against different breast cancer cell lines, while maintaining the structural integrity and allowing for relatively slow release of the active compounds [48]. Thus, we report here the preparation of three platinum(IV) derivatives of cisplatin bearing phenolates as axial ligands and their immobilization in SBA-15 nanoparticles. In these conjugates, both axial positions are occupied with acetyl-protected caffeate (1) or ferulate (2), as well as ferulate (3) (Figure 1). It should be noted that a cisplatin-ferulate conjugate has previously been reported [49]. However, in our view, the spectra included in the supplementary information of the corresponding paper do not confirm or support the structure of the desired product [49]. The prepared platinum(IV) complexes and their respective nanomaterials demonstrated remarkable antiproliferative activity in four different human breast cancer cell lines with different characteristics. In addition, synthesized conjugates and appropriate nanomaterials showed notable anticancer potential against a mouse breast cancer cell line as well.

After one hour, the MTT solution\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3767 8 of 23\nwas discarded and DMSO was used to dissolve the formazan that had formed. The absorbance of this formazan, along with the reference/background signal, could be measured at wavelengths of 540 nm and 670 nm. Measurements were taken utilizing SpectraMax M5 multi-well plate reader (MolecularDevices, San Jose, CA, USA). For the CV assay, cells were fixed with 4% PFA for 20 min at room temperature after being washed once with PBS. The PFA solution was then removed and the cells were left to dry for 10 min. Afterwards, cells were stained with 0.2% crystal violet solution for 20 min followed by removal of the staining solution, washing of the cells with water and letting them dry overnight at room temperature. Finally, upon addition of acetic acid (33% in aqua bidest.) to the stained cells, the absorbance was measured at reference wavelengths of 540 nm and 670 nm as described earlier [56]. A four-parametric logistic function was used to obtain the mean value of the cell viability, which is expressed as a percentage in comparison to untreated cells [57]. SigmaPlot 14.0 and Microsoft Excel 2013 were employed for data analyses and IC50 and MC50 calculation."

There were several staining procedures used: (1) CFSE for observing the influence on cellular proliferation, (2) AnnV/PI for identifying apoptotic cells, (3) ApoStat for caspase activity detection, (4) AO for autophagy detection, (5) DHR for reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) measurement, (6) DAF-FM for intracellular nitric oxide (NO) measurement, and (7) PI for cell cycle analysis.

Three separate replicates of the experiment were run. Depending on the particular staining agent, channels FL1 (green emission), FL2 (orange emission), and/or FL3 (dark red emission) were used for fluorescence detection. For AnnV/PI, ApoStat, and AO staining, after 72 h treatment with the investigated agents, the cells were trypsinized and rinsed with PBS. Afterwards, cells staining according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocols was performed, with AnnV/PI in AnnV-binding buffer (15 min, room temperature), ApoStat in PBS 5% FBS (30 min, 37 \u25e6C) and AO 10 \u00b5M in PBS (15 min, 37 \u25e6C). Finally, upon washing, cells were resuspended in PBS (or in AnnV-binding buffer for AnnV/PI), and analyzed. For CFSE staining, pre-staining with PBS solution of CFSE (1 \u00b5M; 10 min, 37 \u25e6C) followed by washing and seeding of the cells was done, after which they were exposed to experimental agents over a period of 72 h. Before analysis, cells were once again washed, trypsinized and suspended in PBS. Similarly, pre-staining with 1 \u00b5M DHR for 20 min at 37 \u25e6C was first done also for DHR staining.

Thereafter, the dye was discarded and the cells were washed with PBS. Additional incubation of the cells in fresh RPMI-1640 not containing phenol red and serum, was done for 15 min to finish the reaction of de-esterification. Afterwards, cells were trypsinized, resuspended in PBS and analyzed. For analysis of cell distribution across cell cycle phases, after the treatments, 4T1 cells were fixed with 70% ethanol overnight at 4 \u25e6C, and then stained with PI (20 \u00b5g mL\u22121) in the presence of RNase (0.1 mg mL\u22121) during 45 min at 37 \u25e6C."

            "text": "In this study, three cisplatin derivatives with acetyl-protected caffeate, acetyl-protected ferulate or free ferulate in the axial positions (complexes 1, 2 and 3, respectively, Figure 1) were prepared. Complexes 1 and 2 were synthesized by reacting oxoplatin (afforded by\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3767 10 of 23\ncisplatin oxidation with hydrogen peroxide) [50] with an excess of the corresponding acyl chloride derivative of the acetyl-protected phenolic acid in the presence of pyridine as base. Acetyl-protected phenolic acids were used for the synthesis in order to avoid side reactions involving the hydroxyl groups present in their structure. Additionally, as reported by other authors, the reduction potential of the phenolic acids is directly linked to the existence as well as the number of hydroxyl groups [58,59]. Therefore, using caffeic and ferulic acid with free hydroxyl groups could induce reduction of the platinum(IV) in oxoplatin making the formation of the desired products impossible [60,61]. After complexes 1 and 2 were successfully obtained in yields of 64% and 59%, respectively, deprotection of 2 was done with conc. HCl to afford the cisplatin-ferulate conjugate 3. The three obtained platinum(IV) conjugates were characterized by 1H, 13C and 195Pt NMR spectroscopy and mass spectrometry (ESI, Figures S1\u2013S18) and their purity was further confirmed through elemental analysis. Deprotection of 1 was also attempted, employing different procedures and reagents, from conc. HCl to ones which have been reported to be mild and highly selective for deprotection of aromatic acetates such as guanidine\u00b7HCl [62], dibutyltin oxide [63] and ammonium acetate [64]. However, the desired cisplatin-caffeate conjugate could not be obtained; instead, degradation of the complex resulting in very complex 1H NMR spectra was observed in each deprotecting approach. Finally, we also attempted the deprotection using a commercially available enzyme Amano lipase A from Aspergillus niger (Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Steinheim, Germany) which has been reported to cause full O-deacetylation of different acetylated biomolecules under mild conditions [65]. Closely following the reaction by time-resolved 1H NMR spectroscopy (ESI, Figure S19), we noticed that as soon as the deacetylation of 1 begins, chemical shifts corresponding to free caffeate appear. This means that after deprotection, the free hydroxyl groups might reduce the platinum(IV) to platinum(II), leading to separation of the caffeate ligand from the cisplatin scaffold. This confirms the capacity of phenolic acids to induce metal reduction and the higher reduction potential of caffeic acid, which bears two hydroxyl groups in ortho position to each other, by comparison with ferulic acid, which has only one free hydroxyl group. As the deprotection of the acetyl protecting groups can occur under acidic conditions, it could be anticipated that the acidic tumor microenvironment would facilitate such a reaction in vivo. The free hydroxyl groups would then ease the reduction of the platinum(IV) to the cytotoxic platinum(II) and release the axial ligands, making both species available to act upon their respective targets. The platinum(IV) conjugates are particularly poorly soluble in water (1\u20133: 0.09 g, 0.04 g and 0.56 g, respectively, in 1 L H2O) owing to the presence of lipophilic moieties. However, in polar aprotic solvents like DMF and DMSO, they are highly soluble. As confirmed by time-resolved 1H NMR spectroscopy, the conjugates 1\u20133 are stable in DMSO solution over 72 h. During this time, no ligand exchange or complex degradation was observed (Figures S20\u2013S22)."

Additionally, there was a change of the pore diameter Dp from 4.74 nm as determined for the pure SBA-15 to 3.68\u22124.75 nm for the loaded MSNs. On the contrary, the wall thickness Wp, calculated by deducting the pore diameter from the lattice\nFigure 3.

Successful loading of all three compounds 1\u20133 with load contents of 7.51, 9.23 and 10.33 wt% Pt, respectively, was confirmed. The corresponding encapsulation efficiency was calculated to be 70.4%, 83.8% and 89.2%, for SBA-15|1\u2013SBA-15|3, respectively (see ESI, Figure S23 and Tables S1 and S2). Despite the successful production of the mesoporous material with the applied method, which resulted in MSNs with optimal drug loading, it is worth mentioning that significant advances have been made in the engineering of MSNs [67], including some greener approaches with less undesirable environmental impact [68], which should be considered in the future.\n3.3. Release of Platinum(IV) Conjugates from MSNs The in vitro release profiles of the platinum(IV) complexes 1\u20133 encapsulated in silica nanoparticles were determined in PBS (pH = 7.4) by assessing the platinum content in solution (ICP-OES) at predetermined time points (0.08, 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 72 h). As presented in Figure 4A, SBA-15|1 and SBA-15|2 exhibited very low release of only 18 and 5%, respectively, over 72 h. On the contrary, SBA-15|3 released over 70% of its cargo over the same period of time. As these results are consistent with the solubility profiles of the three conjugates in water, it is probable that in this case drug release is driven by solubility of the drugs in the surrounding media. In the first hours, saturation of the solution is achieved and, therefore, prolonged contact with the fluid does not lead to increase the amount of platinum(IV) conjugate released. By exchanging the medium each hour in the time interval of up to 10 h, saturation of PBS with the drugs from nanomaterials SBA-15|1 and SBA-15|2 is avoided. As initially observed, the release is low, but continuous (Figure\nFigure 3.

The lattice parameter itself was attained by SAXS, and specifies the repetition rate of the hexagonal pores of the MSNs. Thus, the acquired data showing similar values for a for all pure and loaded MSNs are consistent with what is expected. Finally, as shown in Figure 3B, the SAXS patterns of pure SBA-15 and SBA-15|1\u2013SBA-15|3 exhibit diffraction peaks (see Table 1) typical for hexagonally ordered MSNs, highlighting the particles\u2019 unaltered structure once more.

A similar observation was made for the SBA15 material (>100 \u00b5g mL\u22121). On the contrary, the platinum(IV) conjugates 1\u20133 demonstrated antitumor activity in the range similar to (against MDA-MB-468 and HCC1937 cell lines) or higher (against MCF-7 and BT-474 cell lines) than cisplatin. Certain discrepancies were observed between the results acquired by MTT and CV assays against the MCF-7 cell line upon treatment with the platinum(IV) conjugates and against BT-474, HCC1937 and MDA-MB-468 cell lines upon treatment with cisplatin, implying that in these cases the mechanism through which cytotoxicity is achieved might be involving cell metabolism pathways [72\u201375].\n(a) recalculated based on platinum content (EDX) and drug release (ICP-OES).\nImmobilization of the platinum(IV) complexes 1\u20133 in MSNs led to a significant improvement of the antiproliferative activity of all three conjugates against all cell lines involved in the study. For comparative evaluation with the activity of cisplatin and the free platinum(IV) complexes, recalculation of the IC50 values for the drug-loaded MSNs (SBA-15|1, SBA-15|2 and SBA-15|3) was made based on the obtained MC50 values considering the platinum content obtained by EDX, as well as the release of the drugs obtained by ICP-OES (detailed explanation in ESI). Submicromolar IC50 values which were at least two times and in some cases several thousand times lower than those for cisplatin were obtained. All drug-loaded MSNs showed the highest activity against the BT-474 cell line responsible for the development of invasive ductal breast cancer and known to be resistant\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3767 14 of 23\nto the conventional treatment with tamoxifen [76,77]. Among the three drug-loaded MSNs, SBA-15|1 was found to have the highest potency against this cell line with an IC50 value of only 0.1 nM. Considering these very promising results, further investigations were necessary in an appropriate in vivo breast cancer model; thus, an orthotopic model of breast cancer by inoculation of 4T1 cells in BALB/c mice was selected. Therefore, the antiproliferative activity of the most active conjugate 1 and appropriate nanomaterial SBA-15|1 was first assessed in vitro in this triple-negative mouse cell line. After 72 h of incubation, the viability of the cells was determined by measurement of total cell culture respiration or number of adherent cells using MTT and CV assays. The results summarized in Table 2 reveal that conjugate 1 strongly affected the cell viability of 4T1 cells similarly as cisplatin alone. Higher activity exceeding the one of cisplatin and 1 was observed upon drug-loading into SBA-15 particles, which is consistent with the results seen in the human breast cancer cell lines. Cell viability under 1\u20133, SBA-15|1\u2013SBA-15|3 and cisplatin exposure is presented in the ESI, Figures S27\u2013S31."

The obtained results reveal that in all applied treatments, induction of massive apoptosis was in the background of diminished cell viability (Figure 5A). In concordance, significant accumulation of fragmented DNA in subG compartment of the cell cycle (Figure 5B), together with a strong caspase activation (Figure 5C) was found in cultures exposed to 1, SBA-15|1 and cisplatin. In parallel, surviving cell subpopulation lost the dividing potential (CFSE assay, Figure 5D).

An intensified autophagic process (AO assay, Figure 5E) in all treated cultures was noticed. However, additional decrease in cell viability was observed also upon neutralization of autophagy through concomitant exposure of the treated cells to the specific inhibitor 3-MA (Figure 5F).

Altogether, platinum(IV) conjugate 1, free and loaded in SBA-15, clearly showed potential to downregulate cell growth through inhibition of proliferation and apoptotic cell induction which is even amplified with autophagy suppression.

            "text": "With the aim to check the effectiveness of conjugate 1 and SBA-15|1 in vivo, an orthotopic model of breast cancer was used. Tumors were induced by inoculation of 4T1 cells in fat pad of the fourth breast in syngeneic BALB/c mice, and treatment started when tumors became palpable. Cisplatin was applied in a therapeutic dose [82], while 1 or SBA-15|1 were applied in an equimolar dose with regards to cisplatin. Results revealed approximately 50% tumor volume reduction upon treatment with cisplatin and SBA-15|1, while conjugate 1 alone decreased the tumor volume by 20% (Figure 7A). As statistical significance was not reached after the application of the mentioned doses, the experiment was repeated with a dose of 10 mg kg\u22121 for the free conjugate 1 and 35 mg kg\u22121 for SBA-15|1. The obtained results revealed remarkable inhibition of tumor growth in all three experimental groups (Figure 7B). The experiment was concluded with the sacrifice of the animals and histopathological examination of their tumors, liver and kidney. Average percentage of tumor\u2019s necrosis on tissue cross section was the largest in the control group (30%), while all treatments dramatically decreased necrotic area surface (conjugate 1 (14%), SBA-15|1 (14%) and cisplatin (12%), Figure 7C). In addition, mitotic index, represented as mitotic figure count per one square millimeter, again was the highest in the control group, while rate of mitosis was diminished in tumor tissue sections of all treated groups (Figure 7B,D). Having in mind that tumors with large necrotic areas are recognized as highly aggressive and associated with poor prognosis [83], reduced necrotic zones together with lower mitotic rate upon the treatments indicates decreased neoplastic potential of the tumor tissue and underlines the advantage of the applied treatments. In liver, findings characteristic for 4T1 metastatic breast cancer model with presence of extramedullary hematopoiesis, mainly represented by cells of myeloid lineage and in lesser amount by megakaryocytes, were observed [84,85]. Hematopoietic cells were present around and within the portal tracts, as well as in the sinusoid of the liver. The highest level of hematopoiesis was found in the control group, while upon treatment, in all treated groups it was almost absent (Figure 8). This fact led to the conclusion that all three treatments were effective in a way that inhibits hematopoiesis which was conditioned with the amount of tumor\u2019s cell burden. No relevant signs of hepatotoxicity were found in any of the groups. There was no inflammation nor necrosis in this experimental setting (Figure 8). Some degree of dilatation of small blood vessels (mainly venules) mostly in the SBA-15|1 group, without knowledge of functional derangement, was noted. In kidney tissue, there were no significant signs of nephrotoxicity in all groups. Normal histomorphology was dominantly registered (Figure 8). Concordantly, all parameters (blood, bilirubin, pH, ketone, protein, specific gravity, leukocyte, urobilinogen and nitrite) tested in urine of animals which were exposed to treatment, showed no difference to the control group of untreated animals (ESI, Table S4). In the group treated with cisplatin, however, protein casts were found in the tubules, and dilatation of small periglomerular blood vessels was observed. This indicates that despite the fact that previous findings suggested the absence of toxicity, cisplatin has a nephrotoxic input [86] which was not observed for 1 and SBA-15|1.\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3767 17 of 23Nanomaterials 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 17 of 23\nFigure 7.

Upon loading of these platinum(IV) complexes into mesoporous silica SBA-15 material, the MSNs SBA-15|1, SBA-15|2 and SBA-15|3 were prepared. Under simulated physiological settings, the MSNs maintained their structural integrity, enabling a moderate (for SBA-15|3) to extremely slow release (for SBA-15|1 and SBA-15|2) of the appropriate platinum(IV) complex. This delayed release is particularly advantageous in vivo because it results in low drug release during circulation and longer drug exposure upon accumulation in the tumor. The free platinum(IV) conjugates 1\u20133 demonstrated higher or similar antiproliferative activity with respect to cisplatin in four human breast cancer cell lines (BT-474, MCF-7, MDA-MB-468 and HCC1937). Great anticancer potential was, however, observed for all three complexes upon their loading into the nanostructured SBA-15. Thus, SBA-15|1, SBA-15|2 and SBA-15|3 demonstrated significantly higher cytotoxicity as compared to cisplatin with nanomolar IC50 values in all four cell lines. For the most potent complex 1 and the corresponding SBA-15|1, mechanistic investigations made in the mouse breast cancer cell line 4T1 indicated the potential of drug and nanomaterial to downregulate cell growth through inhibition of proliferation and apoptotic cell induction. Drug toxicity can be further amplified via autophagy suppression. All observed effects could be due to the enhanced production of NO and ROS/RNS, which affect different cellular processes and, consequently, the cell viability. Furthermore, 1 and SBA-15|1, caused in vivo inhibition of tumor growth in BALB/c mice, decreasing the necrotic area and lowering the mitotic rate. Importantly, nephrotoxicity present in mice treated with cisplatin, was not observed when 1 or SBA-15|1 were used.\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3767 19 of 23\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at https://www. mdpi.com/article/10.3390/nano12213767/s1.
