Clinical decompensation is mostly related to a\u00a0progressive rise in portal pressure, circulatory dysfunction, and more recently systemic inflammation [2]. In this stage of the disease, endotoxins and proinflammatory cytokines increase splanchnic\narterial vasodilation, leading to a\u00a0marked reduction in systemic vascular resistance with stimulation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS), sympathetic nervous system (SNS), and the release of arginine-vasopressin (AVP). The stimulation of these vasoconstrictor systems induces sodium and water retention, which is associated with the occurrence of ascites, dilutional hyponatraemia, and finally hepatorenal syndrome (HRS) [3, 4].\nSpontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP) is one of the major complications of ascites and it is defined as\nClinical and Experimental Hepatology 1/202372\nan infection of the ascitic fluid without an obvious abdominal source. It is the most prevalent infection in hospitalized cirrhotic patients, responsible for about 10-30% of all bacterial infections, with a\u00a020-30% mortality rate [5]. In recent studies, gastrointestinal stasis secondary to portal hypertension and overactive SNS, intestinal dyskinesia, and relative insufficiency in gastric acid and bile secretion resulted in small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) and endotoxaemia. Moreover, cirrhotic patients with ascites have increased intestinal permeability, immune dysfunction, and low ascitic fluid opsonic activity. These factors together with SIBO promote bacterial translocation and finally SBP [6]. The development of SBP worsens liver failure, impairs left ventricular contractibility, and adds to the haemodynamic abnormalities previously mentioned with more reduction in the vascular resistance of the splanchnic and systemic circulation. SBP is the most common precipitant of HRS [2].\nArginine-vasopressin is a\u00a0potent antidiuretic hormone. Because of its systemic vasoconstrictor effects, and crucial role in maintaining circulatory homeostasis, it could presumably serve as a\u00a0 marker of circulatory dysfunction and clinical decompensation in cirrhosis. Moreover, AVP levels increased in stressful situations including sepsis and systemic inflammation [7]. However, measurement of AVP is challenging due to its short half-life, small size, ability to bind platelets, and secretion in a\u00a0 pulsatile pattern. Copeptin is a\u00a0stable and highly sensitive surrogate marker for AVP secretion. It is the cleavage product of the C-terminal portion of the AVP precursor and is released from the posterior pituitary in equimolar amounts in response to AVP release stimulating conditions [7, 8].\nRecent studies have shown that copeptin, independent of liver-specific scoring systems, predicts disease progression and prognosis in cirrhotic patients [7]. To the best of our knowledge, few studies have addressed the relationship between copeptin and sepsis in cirrhosis; moreover, they were performed on variable types of infections [3, 9]. Therefore, we conducted this study with a\u00a0focus on its possible role in patients with SBP. We aimed to explore the possible association between copeptin and complications of liver cirrhosis with stress on its potential role as an inflammatory biomarker in SBP."

The Sohag\nFaculty of Medicine\u2019s Medical Research Ethics Committee (MREC) gave its approval to the study protocol (IRB number: Soh-Med-21-04-24), ClinicalTrials.gov (ID: NCT05401721). Before enrolment, informed written consent was sought from every participant or their relatives (for patients who were comatose).\nA\u00a0 total of 89 cirrhotic ascitic patients (64 males, 25 females) were included, 37 (41.57%) with SBP and 52 (58.43%) without SBP. The diagnosis of liver cirrhosis was based on clinical data and findings from abdominal ultrasound. The diagnosis of SBP was based on the presence of at least 250 cells/ml of polymorphonuclear leucocytes (PMNLs) in the ascitic fluid, with or without positive ascitic fluid culture, and the lack of secondary peritonitis and haemorrhagic ascites [10].\nWe excluded patients with prior antibiotic treatment before hospital admission, severe infections other than SBP, malignancies other than hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), previous liver or kidney transplantation, chronic kidney disease on haemodialysis, coronary insufficiency, heart failure, shock, and polyuria-polydipsia syndrome.\nMethods (see Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Table 1 for more details)\nAll patients were subjected to a\u00a0 thorough medical history and clinical examination. Abdominal ultrasonography was performed and a\u00a0triphasic computed tomography (CT) scan was done if a\u00a0heterogenous liver or hepatic focal lesion was detected on ultrasonography to establish the diagnosis of HCC. Liver function tests, serum creatinine, copeptin, C-reactive protein (CRP), sodium, complete blood count (CBC), and serology for viral hepatitis (hepatitis B surface antigen [HBsAg], and hepatitis C virus [HCV] antibodies) were performed for all patients at admission. To diagnose SBP, a\u00a0paracentesis was carried out under aseptic conditions, with the patient lying flat, and guided by abdominal ultrasonography, total ascitic fluid proteins, white blood cell count (WBCs), and PMNLs were determined. The Child-Turcotte-Pugh (CTP) [11], and model for end-stage liver disease sodium corrected (MELD-Na+) [12] scores were calculated to assess liver disease severity. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) [13] was calculated to assess renal function."

            "text": "The study\u2019s main finding is that cirrhotic patients with SBP have significantly higher copeptin levels than those without SBP. In addition, copeptin was found to be an independent risk factor for SBP development. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to report a\u00a0relationship between copeptin and SBP in cirrhotic patients with ascites, as previous studies in cirrhosis were conducted on different types of infections.\nCopeptin is the C-terminal portion of the AVP precursor and is released from the posterior pituitary together with AVP in equimolar amounts in response to AVP release stimulating conditions [4]. However, the stability and long half-life of copeptin make it a\u00a0better marker than AVP in clinical practice. AVP and hence copeptin is released in response to haemodynamic or osmotic stimuli; moreover, it is elevated in the setting of systemic inflammation and sepsis [3].\nWe found that serum copeptin was significantly elevated in patients with SBP (p = 0.032), with a\u00a0significant correlation with the parameters of the ascitic\nfluid study. This finding could be attributed to several factors. First, bacterial translocation and the associating endotoxaemia which are implicated in the development of SBP and systemic inflammation in cirrhosis directly increase the production of vasopressin and copeptin independently of osmotic stimuli or baroreceptor activity, as evidenced by the significant correlation of copeptin with markers of systemic inflammation, namely CRP and WBCs, as been demonstrated in previous studies [7, 9, 14, 15]. Moreover, copeptin was significantly elevated in patients presenting with SIRS criteria (p = 0.036). In agreement with our results, the value of copeptin as a\u00a0marker of systemic inflammation and sepsis had been confirmed in several studies both in cirrhotic and non-cirrhotic populations [3, 16- 18]. Second, MAP is significantly lower in our studied patients with SBP compared to those without SBP (p = 0.041); this drop in blood pressure results in a\u00a0 strong copeptin response secondary to stimulation of baroreceptors [16]. This pathophysiological mechanism is supported by the significant negative correlation between serum copeptin and MAP. The lower value of MAP in patients with SBP could be attributed to extensive bacterial translocation which triggers an inflammatory response, with\u00a0 increased\u00a0 release of vasoactive factors such as nitric oxide (NO) and proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin 6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), thereby resulting in more splanchnic vasodilation, with\u00a0worsening of\u00a0preexisting systemic circulatory dysfunction, leading to\u00a0 a\u00a0 further reduction in effective arterial blood volume and arterial pressure, and overactivation of endogenous vasoconstrictor systems including AVP [2].\nWhen we performed a\u00a0multivariate logistic regression analysis, copeptin and CRP were independently associated with the existence of SBP. Several risk factors for the presence of SBP have been investigated with variable results; however, the role of inflammation had been recognized in previous research [19]. Several studies have highlighted the potential role of copeptin in identifying the development, severity, and mortality from infections in different clinical settings [20-24]. However, our study is the first to be performed exclusively on SBP, which needs further validation in future studies. CRP is an acute phase reactant which is secreted from hepatocytes and elevated in conditions associated with systemic inflammation; it activates complement and reflects endogenous IL-6 activity [25]. In agreement with our results, Preto-Zamperlini et al. [26] and Falleti et al. [19] found that CRP was independently associated with the presence of SBP.\nIn this study, we found that copeptin detects SBP at a\u00a0cutoff value of 9 pmol/l with sensitivity, specificity,\nClinical and Experimental Hepatology 1/2023 77\nPPV, NPV, and overall accuracy of 73%, 64%, 67%, 71%, and 68.5%, respectively. Furthermore, copeptin was significantly correlated with ascitic fluid WBCs, PMNLs, and total protein, so copeptin could serve as a\u00a0diagnostic marker for SBP. Previous research revealed the potential association between copeptin and complications of liver cirrhosis [7, 8], as well as its increase in infections and sepsis in non-cirrhotic patients [16, 18]. This is the first time that the diagnostic value of copeptin in patients with SBP has been demonstrated, indicating that it is a\u00a0sensitive marker of systemic inflammation and sepsis; however, this observation needs further validation on a\u00a0larger cohort of patients.\nIn the current study, copeptin was significantly elevated in patients who presented with UGIB, a\u00a0moderate to marked amount of ascites, and in those with advanced liver disease as assessed by Child-Pugh, and MELD-Na scores, which is consistent with previous studies [3, 4, 7, 8, 14]. This could be attributed to the ability of copeptin to reflect circulatory dysfunction as evidenced by its strong correlation with pulse, MAP, and sodium. In these patients, the stimulation of baroreceptors occurs due to the presence of significant arterial hypovolaemia secondary to splanchnic vasodilation and portal hypertension [4]. Moreover, blood loss in the case of UGIB adds to arterial hypovolaemia.\nWe found that copeptin was significantly increased in patients with HRS and those with renal impairment as estimated by creatinine levels and eGFR, as demonstrated in previous studies [4, 8, 27, 28]. There are two suggested mechanisms. First, copeptin levels would likely rise as kidney function decreased, since copeptin is eliminated by kidney excretion. Second, more copeptin is secreted in individuals with poorer renal function, because the AVP system is triggered due to decreased urine concentrating ability to maintain water homeostasis [27, 28]. In addition to the aforementioned mechanisms, elevated copeptin in patients with HRS could reflect the extensive circulatory dysfunction due to extreme splanchnic vasodilation, which activates vasoconstrictor systems including AVP. Moreover, a\u00a0strong systemic inflammatory process which is characteristic of advanced cirrhosis may play a\u00a0role [29].\nThe elevated copeptin level in patients with HE was demonstrated in previous studies [4, 7], which is consistent with our findings. Hyponatraemia and systemic inflammation (as indicated by elevated serum CRP) were involved in the pathogenesis of HE. The association of copeptin levels with sodium and CRP may explain the high copeptin levels in these patients [7].\nFinally, the major features of acute decompensation of cirrhosis (SBP, HE, UGIB, HRS, and ascites) in our study could be explained in the light of the newly\nproposed systemic inflammation hypothesis, which posits that in patients with decompensated cirrhosis systemic inflammation is a\u00a0chronic condition linked to persistent translocation of bacterial products from the intestinal lumen to the systemic circulation. The processes through which organ system dysfunctions or failures occur are bouts of systemic inflammation linked to episodic exacerbations of bacterial translocation or proinflammatory precipitants. So, the elevated copeptin levels in these conditions were related to its ability to reflect systemic inflammation. However, it should be noted that the development of major cirrhosis complications is likely to involve a\u00a0synergistic interaction between systemic inflammation and organ-specific mechanisms such as portal hypertension, sodium retention, and hyperammonaemia [2]. The main limitations of this study were that it was a\u00a0 single-centre study on a\u00a0relatively small number of patients. Moreover, the lack of follow-up measures of copeptin during and after completing antibiotic treatment hinders monitoring the impact of SBP treatment on copeptin levels."
