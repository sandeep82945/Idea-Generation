    "abstractText": "Naphthalene ring is present in a number of FDA-approved, commercially available medications, including naphyrone, terbinafine, propranolol, naproxen, duloxetine, lasofoxetine, and bedaquiline. By reacting newly obtained 1-naphthoyl isothiocyanate with properly modified anilines, a library of ten novel naphthalene-thiourea conjugates (5a\u20135j) were produced with good to exceptional yields and high purity. The newly synthesized compounds were observed for their potential to inhibit alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and scavenge free radicals. All of the investigated compounds displayed a more powerful inhibitory profile than the reference agent, KH2PO4 particularly compound 5h and 5a exhibited strong inhibitory potential against ALP with IC50 value of 0.365 \u00b1 0.011 and 0.436 \u00b1 0.057 \u03bcM respectively. In addition, Lineweaver\u2013Burk plots revealed the non-competitive inhibition mode of the most powerful derivative i.e., 5h (ki value 0.5 \u03bcM). To investigate the putative binding mode of selective inhibitor interactions, molecular docking was performed. It is recommended that future research will focus on developing selective alkaline phosphatase inhibitors by modifying the structure of the 5h derivative.",

It hydrolyzes phosphodiester bonds and cleaves phosphate groups from different nucleotides, facilitating cellular absorption of complex molecules that regulate the activity of other enzymes and provide phosphate groups for numerous cellular functions [2]. AP is widely distributed in almost all human tissues as four different isozymes, including tissuespecific intestinal (IAP), placental (PLAP), and germ cell (GCAP) alkaline phosphatases, and the tissue-nonspecific (TNAP) AP expressed in bone, liver, and kidney [3]. Different isozymes of AP are involved in the molecular mechanisms that can overcome checkpoints in cancerous cells, indicating their potential as cancer therapeutic targets. The over-expression of AP is associated with several liver diseases, such as hepatitis, cirrhosis, bile-duct obstruction, fatty liver, and primary cancers, including breast, colon, prostate, and lung cancers [4]. Elevated levels of AP in cancer patients signify that the disease has spread to other body parts, such as the liver, kidney, and bones. In cancer research, there is a focus on developing drugs that target cell cycle progression [5]. The role of alkaline phosphatases (APs) in regulating cell cycle progression has spurred the search for potent and selective inhibitors as a means of inducing growth arrest [6]. Small molecule inhibitors (SMIs) have shown promise as anticancer agents due to their high potency, selectivity, and ability to penetrate cell membranes. While some compounds have been identified as effective inhibitors of APs, most exhibit non-selective inhibition of these enzymes.\nAlkaline phosphatases have been identified as validated drug targets for cancer, and significant efforts are underway to find selective inhibitors of each isozyme of alkaline phosphatase with a complete mechanism of action [7]. Different isozymes of APs are involved in molecular mechanisms that can bypass checkpoints in cancer cells, making them potential targets for cancer treatment. Previously, the only ALP inhibitors available were levamisole and theophylline, with Ki values of 16 and 82 \u00b5M, respectively [8]. However, the development of small druglike molecules that are efficient and selective inhibitors of ALP isozymes is necessary to understand the role of ALPs in health and disease. Figure 1 depicts some identified representative ALP inhibitors [9, 10]. Therefore, ALPs are a promising molecular target for drug discovery, and there is a desperate need for the development of effective and selective ALP isozyme inhibitors.\nHeterocyclic compounds are cyclic compounds that consist of atoms of two or more different elements in the ring structure. They are a diverse and rapidly expanding\nclass of compounds with various applications in medicinal chemistry. Due to their broad range of bioactivities, they are highly sought after for the development of novel drugs. Therefore, the synthesis of heterocyclic compounds from easily accessible starting materials is an important goal for organic chemists. This has led to a vast array of synthetic methods and strategies for the efficient construction of heterocyclic compounds, which are well-documented in the literature [8, 11].\nThiourea derivatives, containing both sulfur and nitrogen, have gained significant attention in drug development research in recent years [12]. These compounds have demonstrated useful properties and have shown potential as active ingredients in antibacterial, antituberculosis, and anticonvulsant drugs. Many of these derivatives contain heterocyclic rings, such as thiadiazoles, oxadiazoles, pyrazoles, and triazoles, which have been the focus of numerous studies [13, 14]. The naphthalene moiety, which is present in several bioactive molecules, has also gained attention due to its potential therapeutic applications. These applications include the treatment of ischemia/reperfusion injury, as well as antimicrobial, anticancer, and SARS-CoV PLpro inhibition. Additionally, KEAP1-NRF2 inhibitors containing naphthalene moieties are being explored for their potential in treating COVID-19 [15, 16].\nThe extensive literature regarding the medicinal significance of naphthalene moiety and the ever-increasing biological spectrum of thioureas, triggered us to design molecules containing both pharmacophoric units in a single molecule using the concept of hybrid pharmacophore approach. To the finest of our knowledge, this is the primary explanation to deliberate the preparation and bioactive properties of novel N-((substituted phenyl) carbamothioyl)1-naphthamides derivatives Fig. 2.\nThe compounds were evaluated for inhibitory potency of APs which was complemented by molecular docking studies to support the AP inhibition data. Along with this, we were also interested to find the antioxidant potential of these compounds which may aid more importance of these scaffolds in the treatment of cancer and associated malignancies. The results showed very promising antioxidant effects along with the alkaline phosphatase inhibition, suggesting these compounds as a lead for the synthesis of more potential compounds."

In addition to those for aromatic C=C at 1550\u20131600 cm\u22121, the FTIR spectra data of synthesized thioureas exhibited distinct characteristic stretching absorption bands corresponding to N\u2013H stretching at 3200\u20133380 cm\u22121, carbonyl at 1650\u20131695 cm\u22121, and thiocarbonyl in the region of 1240\u20131300 cm\u22121.

In comparison to the other derivatives, compound 5h (IC50= 0.365 \u00b1 0.011) was the most effective alkaline phosphatase inhibitor. The alkaline phosphatase inhibition is significantly impacted by the various phenyl ring substituents. The H-bonding-capable molecule 5h, which has a hydroxyl group at the ortho position of the phenyl ring, binds firmly and completely fills the receptor\u2019s pocket. The abrupt decrease in activity in 5j is caused by the replacement of free OH by OCH3.\nThe presence of two electron-withdrawing groups, namely -F & -Cl at the 3 and 2 positions of the phenyl group, respectively, compound 5e demonstrated the lowest\ninhibitory activity. This prevented them from adequately interacting and occupying the receptor site. The compound 5a was identified as the second potent inhibitor with IC50 value of 0.436 \u00b1 0.057 \u00b5M with substitution of \u2013C6H5 at \u2013ortho position of phenyl moiety; On the other hand, the inhibitory impact was diminished by the presence of electron-withdrawing groups on the phenyl ring (Fig. 3)."

The second-most effective free radical scavenger was 5h. Even at high concentrations, the remaining chemicals did not show any noticeable effects (100 \u00b5g/mL). The results were compared with vitamin C, which was used as a reference. Compounds 5i and 5h are more suitable for the scavenging of free radicals than the other compounds in the series because they have electron-donating substituents on the phenyl moiety, specifically \u2013OH and \u2013CH3 at the -meta and -ortho positions. The most energetic molecule is 5h, which can form H-bonding interactions and possesses a hydroxyl group in the ortho position. As in 5j, the substitution of free OH by OCH3 leads in a quick drop in activity. Figure 5 illustrates the results.\nPhysiochemical characteristics of alkaline phosphate\nIn fact, the single-chain hydrolase protein found in human placental alkaline phosphate has 539 amino acids and contains zinc and magnesium ions that are important for downstream signaling cascades. The overall protein structure is made up of 26% \u03b2 sheets, 42% coils and 31% helices, according to the VADAR study. The Ramachandran plot demonstrated that 96.4% residues were positioned in favored regions, proving the correctness of phi (\u03c6) and psi (\u03c8) angles among alkaline phosphate coordinates.

The resulting docked complexes were evaluated based on their minimum energy values (in Kcal/ mol) and the hydrogen/hydrophobic interaction patterns. All compounds demonstrated a favorable binding energy based on their docking orientation. Although the compounds shared the same essential structure, most of the ligands displayed good energy efficiency with minimal energy changes. Levamisole was used as a standard inhibitor of alkaline phosphatase, and its docking score was compared to those of the compounds. Interestingly, most of the compounds exhibited better binding orientation and docking scores than levamisole, indicating their potential as effective inhibitors of alkaline phosphatase. The top-ranked\nposes and docking scores of the compounds are provided in Table 3, while the docking scores and binding interactions of the other compounds can be found in the Supplementary File (Table S1). The results of the molecular docking study suggest that the compounds 5a\u2013j have the potential to act as selective and potent inhibitors of alkaline phosphatase.\nBinding interaction analysis of compound 5a, 5h and levamisole against alkaline phosphatase\nThe molecular docking analysis for compound 5a shows a docking score of \u22127.5 kcal/mol, indicating a favorable binding energy with the alkaline phosphatase enzyme. The compound was engaging the hydrophobic residues of catalytic site including leucine residue. The compound 5a didn\u2019t formed any hydrogen bonds with the protein residues. However, multiple hydrophobic interactions were stabilizing the protein ligand complex. Particularly, lipophilic part of compound 5a including aromatic rings were\nengaging the Leu467, Ile480 and Phe476 in alkyl and pialkyl interactions whereas Tyr490 was engaged in pi\u2013pi interaction with benzene ring. Other interacted hydrophobic residues were as follows; His479, His469, Phe483, and Gln464. In terms of in vitro IC50, compound 5a demonstrated a potency of 0.436 \u00b1 0.057 \u00b5M, which was the second-best result among the compounds tested. This suggests that the favorable docking score and the specific hydrophobic interactions observed between the compound and the enzyme may have contributed to its inhibitory activity [17]. The Fig. 6 is representing the 2D and 3D docked conformation of compound 5a against alkaline phosphatase.\nThe molecular docking analysis revealed that compound 5h displayed the highest docking score of \u22128.1 kcal/mol and formed a hydrogen bond with Tyr295, with a bond length of 3.23 angstroms. The electronegative oxygen part of compound 5h was producing hydrogen bond with NH part of Tyr295. This binding interaction was further stabilized by hydrophobic residues Lys294, Arg333, Ala291, Pro290, Val242, Tyr236, Glu289, and Gln298. The naphthalene part of compound 5h was engaging majority of hydrophobic residues. Interestingly, 5 h also exhibited the best in-vitro IC50 value of 0.365 \u00b1 0.011 \u00b5M among all the tested compounds. The competitive binding energy and SAR analysis indicated that the 5h compound is a potent alkaline phosphatase inhibitor. All 2D docking photos of additional compounds are given in the Supplementary Material (Figs. S3\u2013S10). This suggests that the favorable binding interaction observed in the molecular docking analysis might have contributed to the higher inhibitory activity of 5 h towards alkaline phosphatase. These findings\nprovide valuable insights into the potential development of more effective alkaline phosphatase inhibitors for the treatment of various diseases, including cancer. Overall, the molecular docking analysis provided a useful tool to predict the binding interaction of compounds with the target protein, which can assist in the design and optimization of novel inhibitors with improved potency and selectivity. The Fig. 7 is representing the 2D and 3D docked conformation of compound 5a against alkaline phosphatase.\nThe standard inhibitor, levamisole, showed a docking score of \u22126.0 kcal/mol, which is lower than both 5a and 5h. Levamisole also did not form any hydrogen bonds. In addition, the standard inhibitor was engaging important amino acid residues in hydrophobic interactions. The following amino acid residues were engaged in hydrophobic interactions Val313, Arg269, Glu309, Glu312, Leu273 and Leu272. On the other hand, compound 5 h showed the best docking score of \u22128.1 kcal/mol and formed a hydrogen bond with Tyr295. Additionally, 5 h exhibited hydrophobic interactions with\nLys294, Arg333, Ala291, Pro290, Val242, Tyr236, Glu289, and Gln298. These interactions suggest that 5 h may be a more effective inhibitor of alkaline phosphatase than levamisole. Overall, the molecular docking results suggest that compound 5 h may be a promising candidate for further investigation as an inhibitor of alkaline phosphatase Fig. 8."
