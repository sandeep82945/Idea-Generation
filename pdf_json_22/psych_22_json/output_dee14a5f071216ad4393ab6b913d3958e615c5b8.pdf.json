    "abstractText": "In this essay I will consider a sequence of questions. The first questions concern the biological function of intelligence in general, and cognitive prostheses of human intelligence in particular. These will lead into questions concerning human language, perhaps the most important cognitive prosthesis humanity has ever developed. While it is traditional to rhapsodize about the cognitive power encapsulated in human language, I will emphasize how horribly limited human language is \u2013 and therefore how limited our cognitive abilities are, despite their being augmented with language. This will lead to questions of whether human mathematics, being ultimately formulated in terms of human language, is also deeply limited. I will then combine these questions to pose a partial, sort-of, sideways answer to the guiding concern of this essay: what we can ever discern about that we cannot even conceive? I\u2019d like to consider a sequence of questions in this essay, each one leading into the next, somewhat like successive chapters in a monograph. The first of these questions concern the nature of intelligence in biological systems, viewed from a long time-scale, evolutionary perspective. These questions will lead to arguments that our cognitive capabilities are extraordinarily limited. Specifically, I will argue that those very aspects of our mathematics and science that are vaunted as having such power for investigating the nature of reality are actually manifestations of the extremely constrained nature of our mathematics and science. These arguments then lead to questions concerning whether our cognitive abilities might forever be limited this way. I then consider the resultant limitations this would impose, on what we might ever be able to glean concerning what it is that we will never even be able to imagine. The first of these questions have been raised before, but the ending ones are novel, I believe, at least in their emphasis. These questions concern the possibility of cognitive constructs whose capability is beyond that of human minds. Unfortunately though, I am a mere human",

The first questions concern the biological function of intelligence in general, and cognitive prostheses of human intelligence in particular. These will lead into questions concerning human language, perhaps the most important cognitive prosthesis humanity has ever developed. While it is traditional to rhapsodize about the cognitive power encapsulated in human language, I will emphasize how horribly limited human language is \u2013 and therefore how limited our cognitive abilities are, despite their being augmented with language. This will lead to questions of whether human mathematics, being ultimately formulated in terms of human language, is also deeply limited. I will then combine these questions to pose a partial, sort-of, sideways answer to the guiding concern of this essay: what we can ever discern about that we cannot even conceive?\nI\u2019d like to consider a sequence of questions in this essay, each one leading into the next, somewhat like successive chapters in a monograph. The first of these questions concern the nature of intelligence in biological systems, viewed from a long time-scale, evolutionary perspective. These questions will lead to arguments that our cognitive capabilities are extraordinarily limited. Specifically, I will argue that those very aspects of our mathematics and science that are vaunted as having such power for investigating the nature of reality are actually manifestations of the extremely constrained nature of our mathematics and science. These arguments then lead to questions concerning whether our cognitive abilities might forever be limited this way. I then consider the resultant limitations this would impose, on what we might ever be able to glean concerning what it is that we will never even be able to imagine. The first of these questions have been raised before, but the ending ones are novel, I believe, at least in their emphasis.\nThese questions concern the possibility of cognitive constructs whose capability is beyond that of human minds. Unfortunately though, I am a mere human\ndiscussing these questions will necessarily be allusive and somewhat imprecise. Nonetheless, I hope the essence of what I have to say is clear. To that end, I finish this essay with some suggestions for how to empirically answer the questions I raise, thereby (I hope!) rescuing this essay from the vast swamps of self-important bloviation to be found in the libraries of humankind under the moniker of \u201cphilosophy\u201d.\nI begin this journey of questions by noting that high levels of abstract intelligence, high ability to reason about issues other than how to manage our physical bodies, seems to have been exceedingly rare across all Terran species.1 This is true even if we consider the entire history of life on Earth, rather than restrict attention to the set of species currently inhabiting our biosphere.\nIndeed, for vast stretches of time the highest level of intelligence among all species on Earth seems to have increased very slowly, at best. Even if there were not an immediate adaptive fitness benefit to a species for increasing its intelligence level, one might expect that the random exploration inherent in biological evolution would have resulted in a stochastic \u201cdrift\u201d increasing the maximal level of intelligence over all species in the biosphere, much like the drift d process that played a part in the increase in the complexity of the biosphere as a whole [78].\nOne way to investigate this peculiar reluctance of intelligence to increase is to adopt a functionalist, teleological perspective on evolution, i.e., to view evolution as a process that creates increasingly \u201coptimized\u201d designs of biological organisms. It may simply be that it may takes \u223c a billion years to design a brain with our levels of intelligence, if the design is done using the kinds of \u201coptimization algorithm\u201d embodied in natural selection. Human brains are physically complicated devices. Presumably much of that complexity is necessary in any system that has the cognitive capabilities of our brains. And presumably, such complexity requires a while to evolve under the optimization algorithm embodied in (this very simplified formulation of) natural selection.\nWhile it\u2019s hard to address this possible explanation quantitatively, it seems implausible. No other significant capability of biological organisms \u2014 and there are some capabilities that are implemented with very complicated designs \u2014 took a billion years of tinkering to evolve. Other biological capabilities, ranging from ability to navigate through an environment based on patterns of photons reflected from that environment, to the ability to defend against a vast range of microbial assaults, to the ability to disentangle multiple simultaneous sets of coupled waves\n1As with so very many terms in this essay, I will not engage in the fraught exercise of trying to give a precise definition to the term \u201cintelligence\u201d. As mentioned, of necessity, this essay is allusive \u2014 and I trust that the reader gets my drift, even without pages and pages of tortured text squirreling through subterranean tunnels trying to gain a grain or two of increased terminological precision.\nparty problem\u201d; all of these abilities involve very complicated mechanisms. And yet all have been extremely common across Terran species, both at present and in the past. So this explanation seems to have major problems.\nAll other possible explanations for the rarity of high levels of abstract intelligence that I know of have their own problems \u2014 except for the simplest explanation, the one suggested by Occam\u2019s razor. This explanation follows from the hypothesis that the fitness costs associated with high levels of abstract intelligence are large compared to the typical associated fitness benefits. It may simply be that evolutionarily speaking, it is stupid to be smart.\nIndeed, it seems that at least the sensory-motor information processing in our brains involve all kinds of algorithmic shenanigans so that we can actually use our brains as little as possible, so that we can think as little as possible. Phrased in terms of a sloppy and hackneyed metaphor, it seems that the software running on our brains is designed so that it involves executing as few lines of code as possible. (See for example the vast literature on the brain\u2019s use of predictive coding [8, 107] and sparse coding [91, 106], as well the literature on the low-level processing in the visual system [99, 26, 111], in addition to the literature on the coding of more abstract concepts in the brain [9, 53].)\nIt is often argued that the underlying reason for this aversion to thinking is to reduce the associated fitness costs [15, 108]. Indeed, such costs to thinking are not difficult to find. In particular, it turns out that brains are extraordinarily expensive metabolically on a per-unit-mass basis, far more than almost all other organs (the heart and liver being the sole exceptions \u2014 see [29, 108, 79, 16]). Consistent with this, it is not just that the software comprising our minds that seems tailored to reduce metabolic costs; the hardware supporting that software \u2014 the physical architecture of our brains \u2014 also seems tailored to reduce metabolic costs.\nWe do not have a good understanding of exactly how our hardware is used to provide the ability of humans to engage in activities requiring high levels of abstract intelligence. We do not understand how \u201cbrain makes mind\u201d [20]. Indeed, the brain seems to incur major energetic costs even when it is in the resting state, not currently engaged in any \u201ctask-focused\u201d activities, but simply providing the ability to engage in such activities [97]. In addition, there are many subtleties in how the \u201csize\u201d of the brain (which can be quantified many ways) is related to the associated computational abilities [70]. Nonetheless, it seems clear that less metabolic cost \u21d2 less brain mass (smaller neurons and / or number of neurons, perhaps proportional to other attributes)\u21d2 less abstract intelligence.\nIn light of this advantage of low intelligence, one would expect humans to have the minimal possible computational abilities sufficient for surviving in the particular ecological niche in which we were formed (namely, the niche of social omnivores that inhabit African mixed forest / savanna). One would expect our\ntion that there are some cognitive abilities with the following two attributes: i) they are not directly helpful for surviving in our ecological niche (and are also not the inevitable side-effects of some such abilities that are helpful); ii) they are crucial to formulating a science and mathematics (hereafter abbreviated as SAM) that fully (!!!) encompasses the nature of physical reality. Then due to the adaptive fitness costs of all cognitive abilities, we would have to predict that we do not have these kinds of abilities. In other words, we would have to conclude that the actual SAM that humanity has created (or would ever be able to create) cannot fully encompass the nature of physical reality, simply because natural selection has ensured that we do not have the cognitive abilities necessary to do so.\nBiology also provides some purely statistical reasons, not involving arguments based on Darwinian natural selection, which suggest that our cognitive abilities are deficient. As a first example, assign a bit to every other species on Earth that we can, a bit that it equals 1 if we are sure that that species has all the cognitive abilities necessary to fully apprehend the nature of physical reality. There is one species we cannot assign such a bit to: ourselves, since we do not know whether we have deficiencies in this kind of reasoning. But we can assign it to all the other billions of species that have ever existed on Earth: yes, that species is deficient, cognitively, for the simple reason that there are features of our SAM that no member of that species is cognitively capable of understanding. We can treat all of these bits as a dataset. If we applied an admittedly crude Bayesian argument to this particular dataset, along the lines of Laplace\u2019s law of succession, we would conclude that it is very likely that the one species for which we have cannot assign a bit value \u2014 ourselves \u2014 is overwhelmingly likely to have such deficiencies as well.\nAs a second example of such an argument combining evolutionary history and simple statistics, fix some way of formalizing a \u201ctype\u201d of cognitive capability. The ability to sense the external world would be one such \u201ctype\u201d of cognitive capability; the ability to remember past events would be another; the ability to plan a future sequence of actions would be another, etc. The suite of cognitive attributes that we collectively possess that enable our SAM \u2014 our \u201cintelligence\u201d, if you will\u2014 is yet another type of cognitive ability. Given any such formalization, we could consider the union of all kinds of cognitive capabilities possessed by all organisms on Earth at any given time. We can then conduct a time-series analysis of how the size of that union of all kinds of cognitive capabilities of all species on Earth has changed over evolutionary history.\nAs described above, the highest level of intelligence of any single species yet reached on Earth is small (perhaps with the single exception of us). Yet there are very many other types of cognitive ability. Arguably, given this breadth of types of cognitive ability, any single species (including us) has only a small fraction of\nwe use, and no matter how we formalize \u201ctype of cognitive capability,\u201d it seems we will conclude that there is currently a strictly increasing trend in the size of the union over all species of their cognitive capabilities. After all, in no evolutionary period (outside of the several mass extinctions) has the set of all types of cognitive capabilities held by any entity in the terrestrial biosphere shrunk. The biosphere as a whole has never lost the ability to engage in certain kinds of cognitive capability.\nSo on the one hand, there seems to have been growth over evolutionary time in the maximal degree of the kind of intelligence needed to create SAM of any single terrestrial species. But there has also been growth in the set of kinds of cognitive capability possessed by all species collectively. If we simply extrapolate either of these trends into the future, we\u2019re forced to conclude that there are likely to be levels of intelligence and kinds of cognitive capabilities that some future organisms will have but that no currently living Terran species has \u2014 including us.\nGiven all these reasons for supposing we have deficiencies in our cognitive abilities, it should not be surprising that the list of our computational limitations is legion. To give one striking example, evidently it was not even sufficiently beneficial in terms of adaptive fitness for us to have working memory capable of holding more than seven enumerated objects at once. Needless to say, there are many artificial computational systems that are capable of this \u201cfeat\u201d. Indeed, modern digital computers, which are exceedingly simple systems in comparison to the complexity of the human brain, vastly outperform us computationally in myriad ways, going far beyond the number of enumerated objects in their memories [28, 50, 103]. Moreover, the small set of those cognitive tasks that we can still perform better than our primitive digital computers is substantially shrinking from year to year \u2014 witness the recent rise of foundational AI models and the ever-expanding list of new abilities afforded by deep RL algorithms like DeepMind\u2019s Alpha-* algorithms.2\nDespite all our preening in front of our collective mirror about how smart we are, it seems that we must in fact be very dumb organisms, by any objective criteria, in terms of abstract intelligence. Thanks to the exigencies of natural selection, we must have highly restricted cognitive abilities \u2014 the barest minimum needed to scrape through a few million years of hunting and gathering until we got lucky and stumbled into the Neolithic revolution. It may simply be that that the presumption stated at the beginning of this essay, that we \u201chave high level of abstract intelligence\u201d is, objectively speaking, wrong. It may simply may reflect\n2It is important to appreciate that the rate of this shrinkage is significant, notwithstanding the fact that there are, for now, some important cognitive tasks that it has been argued elude AI programs [87], and notwithstanding the research frustrations endured by some the very earliest of AI researchers, sometimes summarized as \u201cMoravec\u2019s paradox\u201d [27, 86, 89].\nwe happen to have above all others.\nHowever, before getting too comfortable in this conclusion reached by considering the time series of intelligence on Earth, there is a peculiarity of that time series that begs investigation. The maximal intelligence on Earth was gradually, smoothly increasing until around 50,000 years ago. It seems that at that time there was a substantial jump, when modern homo sapiens started on the trajectory that would ultimately produce all of modern science, art, and philosophy. Is this the case? Are we in fact the fresh-born products of a substantial jump in the cognitive ability of organisms on Earth?\nIf we provisionally suppose that there was indeed a major jump in our cogni-\ntive abilities very recently, we arrive at the first major question of this essay:\n1. Why is there a major chasm, with the minimal cognitive capabilities neces-\nsary for survival by pre-Holocene hominids on one side, and on the other side, all those cognitive capabilities that Kurt Go\u0308del, Albert Einstein, and Ludwig van Beethoven called upon when conjuring their wonders?\nWhy is there the major chasm between the computational skill set needed to avoid the proverbial lion lurking in the bush, and the computational skill set that Lady Murasaki, Vyasa, and Al Khwarazmi employed when they wished upon their separate stars? As the canard goes, there is no evident fitness benefit for a savanna-forged hairless ape to be able to extract from the deepest layers of physical reality cognitive palaces like the Standard Model of particle physics, Chaitin\u2019s incompleteness theorem, or the Zen parable, \u201cTen Verses on Oxherding.\u201d And in fact, by the arguments above, there are likely major fitness costs to our having such abilities. So why do we have them?\nWe can gain some perspective on this question by reformulating it more con-\ncretely, in the context of the other species in the terrestrial biosphere:\n2. Restricting attention to what are, in some sense, the most universal of hu-\nmanity\u2019s achievements, the most graphic demonstrations of our cognitive abilities:\nWhy were we able to construct present-day science and mathematics, but no other species ever did? Why have we \u2013 uniquely \u2013 been able to decipher some features of the Cosmic Baker\u2019s hands, by scrutinizing the breadcrumbs that They scattered about the universe? Why do we have that cognitive ability despite its fitness costs? Was it some subtle requirement of the ecological niche in which we were formed \u2014 a niche that at first glance appears rather pedestrian, and certainly does not overtly select for the ability to construct something like quantum chronodynamics? Or is our cognitive ability\nbyproduct of some other trait? In other words, is it all just a cosmic fluke?\nThis is hardly a new question, of course. But considered carefully, it gives rise\nto a sequence of many other, less commonly considered questions. To begin:\n3. Are we really sure that no other species ever constructed some equivalent of\npresent-day SAM? Are we really sure that no other apes \u2014 or cetaceans or cephalopods \u2014 have achieved some equivalent of our SAM, but an equivalent that we are too limited to perceive?\nI would say that this question at least we can answer, and the answer is \u2018yes\u2019. It may well be that, if and when we come to partially decipher the communication systems of some non-human species [10], we will find messages in their communications that in some sense correspond to our SAM. For argument\u2019s sake, let\u2019s suppose that this will be the case \u2014 that we will find such science(ish) and math(ish) messages in the communications among members of some other species.\nEven with that assumption, we would still have to conclude that the SAM of all other terrestrial species is inferior to ours in some extremely important respects. After all, incontrovertibly, the Earth\u2019s physical environment reflects the effects of our understanding of SAM \u2014 it reflects our activities \u2014 far more than it reflects the activities of any other single species [17]. There is no reason to believe that other species would not have also completely transformed the biosphere to serve their ends, just as we have, if only they had the SAM that is necessary to do so. The implication, given the absence of such a transformation by some other species, is that no such species has developed as sophisticated a SAM as we have.\nThere is nothing subtle about this evidence of our singular abilities in SAM. Nor is reasoning based on this evidence particularly biased in our favor. After all, the evidence of our abilities in SAM, given by our transformation of the biosphere, is obvious to members of other species (many of whom we\u2019ve actually wiped out), whereas there is no evidence of their abilities in SAM that is similarly obvious to us.\nThis answer to question (3) suggests that we should modify question (2):\n4. If the evidence of the uniqueness of our SAM is the modifications that we,\nuniquely, have wreaked upon the terrestrial biosphere, should the question really be why we are the only species who had the cognitive abilities to construct our SAM and were able to build upon that understanding, to so massively re-engineer our environment? To give a simple example, might some cetaceans even exceed our SAM, but just do not have the physical\nthe biosphere in any way? Should the focus of the inquiry not be whether we are the only ones who had the cognitive abilities to construct our current SAM, but rather should the focus be expanded, to whether we are the only ones who had both those abilities and the ancillary physical abilities (e.g., opposable thumbs) that allowed us to produce physical evidence of our SAM?\nNote that the combination of our SAM and our physical ability to exploit that SAM has not only provided us with the ability to twist the biosphere to satisfy our desires, but also with cognitive prostheses [58] and extended minds [38, 40, 37]. Furthermore, the capabilities of those extended minds have been greatly magnified over time \u2014 by the cumulative collective process of culture and technological development [49, 52, 69]. In turn, these extended minds have accelerated the development of culture and technology. There is a feedback loop between the collective capability of our cognitive prostheses and our technology.\nThis feedback loop has allowed us to \u201cbuild out\u201d the set of our original cognitive capabilities, to expand its breadth in an exponentially growing dynamics that is not solely driven by genotypic evolution. This distinguishes the current expansion in our capabilities from their expansion before the Pleistocene, and from all expansions in the cognitive abilities for all other Terran species, which were driven by genotypic evolution.3 Concretely, this combination of our high current cognitive abilities and the physical ability to exploit them may not only have allowed us to expand our SAM beyond whatever other Terran species have already achieved, but even beyond what other Terran ever can achieve. Indeed, it may have been this feedback loop, between the abilities afforded by our cognitive prostheses and our technology, which allowed the gap to form between our cognitive capabilities and the minimum such abilities necessary for survival on the Veldt. In other words, this loop may provide the answer to question (1).\nHowever, a perhaps crucial feature of the feedback loop is that while it has inflated our original cognitive capabilities, it is not clear that it has provided us any wholly new cognitive capabilities. In fact, it might not ever be able to. The future phenotypic possibilities of any species evolving according to genotypic evolution are constrained by the frozen accidents in its evolutionary past [5, 42, 82], which limit its possible future forms. This may not only be true for relatively slow genotypic evolution; it may be just as true if the evolution is very fast and driven by a feedback loop between extended minds and collective culture. Perhaps our future SAM will be constrained by the set of cognitive capabilities we had when we started to construct our current SAM.\n3I\u2019m here ignoring the cultural evolution that seems to take place in some primates and\nCetaceans, as being inconsequential to the issues considered in this essay.\nbetween our current SAM, on the one hand, and the kinds of knowledge our minds were designed to uncover by traipsing across the infamous Veldt, on the other hand, perhaps that gap is not a \u201cchasm.\u201d Perhaps it is more accurate to describe the gap as a small divot, with the full range of all that will forever be unknown to us, all that our SAM can never encompass, extending far beyond our current position, on this side of the gap.\nYes, sure, perhaps our SAM and our ability to exploit our SAM far exceeds that of other species on Earth. But perhaps these are tiny differences, almost invisible on the scale of what would accompany cognitive capabilities that are more extensive than those that we will ever have. Maybe the answer to Wigner\u2019s famous question, about why our mathematics is \u201cunreasonably effective\u201d at capturing the nature of our physical reality [112], is simply that our mathematics isn\u2019t very effective at all, that in fact our mathematics can only capture a tiny sliver of reality. Perhaps the only reason it appears to be so effective is because our vista is so restricted, to just those very, very few aspects of reality that we can conceive of.4\nTherefore, perhaps the interesting question is not why our augmented minds seem to have abilities greater than those necessary for the survival of our ancestors, but rather whether our augmented minds have the minimal abilities necessary for grasping reality:\n5. Ancillary abilities or no, are we unavoidably limited to enlarging and en-\nriching the SAM that was produced by our species with the few cognitive abilities we were born with? Is it impossible for us to concoct wholly new types of cognitive abilities \u2014 computational powers that are wholly novel in kind \u2014 which in turn could provide us wholly new kinds of SAM, kinds of SAM that would concern aspects of physical reality currently beyond our ken?\nPerhaps the earliest versions of this question in modern, Western literature were throwaway phrases scattered among various essays. In these early, verbal baubles it was suggested that the universe may be \u201cqueerer / stranger / odder than we can suppose / imagine / conceive\u201d [64, 39]. Having other fish to fry, the authors of these early texts rarely fleshed out what they meant with these phrases. In fact, they often seemed to mean that the universe may be stranger than we can currently imagine, due to limitations in current scientific understanding, rather than being stranger than we can ever imagine, with any future science, due to inherent limitations of what we can ever do with (future efflorescences of) our minds.5\n4See [66] for similar sentiments concerning Wigner\u2019s question. 5For example, in [39], Clarke explicitly considers the first type of strangeness, not the second,\ndetail [18, 34, 57, 77, 95]. However, most of those later forms of the question have concerned the dubious \u201chard problem of consciousness\u201d [68] and the closely related \u201cmind \u2014 body problem\u201d [85]. They did not concern the issues under consideration in this essay.\nFortunately, we can approach question (5) in a more rigorous manner. To see how, we can start with the recently (re)popularized idea that some portion of our physical universe, including in particular we denizens of that physical universe, might just be part of a simulation produced in a physical computer of some supersophisticated race of aliens [23, 65, 33].6\nThis idea can be extended in an obvious manner, simply by noting that the aliens that simulate our universe might themselves be a simulation in the computer of some even more sophisticated species, and so on and so on, in a sequence of ever-more sophisticated aliens. Going the other direction, in the not too distant future we might produce our own simulation of a universe, complete with entities that have \u201ccognitive capabilities\u201d. Indeed, we might produce such a simulation whose cognitive entities can produce their own simulated universe in turn, etc. So there might be a sequence of species\u2019, each one with a computer running a simulation that produces the one just below it in the sequence, with us somewhere in the middle of that sequence.\nThis question of whether we are a simulation or not is answered rather trivially if we adopt ontic structural realism, especially if it is formalized in terms of Tegmark\u2019s level IV multiverse: yes, in some universes we are a simulation, and no, in some other universes we are not. (See also [31, 93].) For argument\u2019s sake though, let\u2019s restrict attention to universes in which we are indeed a simulation. This would raise an obvious question:\n6. Is possible for one species, at one level of the sequence of {computers run-\nning simulations of computers that are running simulations of ...}, to itself simulate a computer that is higher up in the sequence that it is?\nIf the answer to this question is \u2018no\u2019, that suggests that no matter what we humans, in our physical universe, can do with our brains, it is a strictly smaller subset of what can be done by the aliens and their computers who reside higher up than us in the sequence of simulations.\nwhen he introduces the phrase, while in [64], Haldane explicitly predicts that we will \u201cone day . . . be able to look at existence from the point of view of non-human minds\u201d, which seems to rule out the second type of strangeness. 6Note that this idea presupposes a form of the Church-Turing thesis, or at least ontic structural realism [60, 84, 83, 7] and related concepts grounded in modern physics. In this respect, and many others, it is just a special case of Tegmark\u2019s level IV multiverse [109, 110].\nterms like \u2018simulate\u2019 and \u2018computer\u2019. In particular, we don\u2019t want to simply require that we can find a function f that maps u, one state of the physical system U that the aliens use to implement their super-powerful computer, to the initial value of us, w, and maps a later state of that system U, call it u\u2032, to our final value, w\u2032. That is actually a vacuous requirement \u2014 so long as our initial and final states differ, as do u and u\u2032, there are an infinite number of such functions f . This is not a sufficiently strong requirement for U to be interpreted as a computer, that is capable of simulating the dynamics of us.7. Rather for a physical system U to be a computer means (at a minimum) that there must be a function f that maps every input-output calculation carried out by an abstract computer to an associated pair of states of U, such that the dynamics of U implements that inputoutput calculation, and does so for every possible input to that abstract computer. (See [30, 45, 114, 88, 102].)\nOnce we adopt this more stringent requirement of what it means for a physical system to be a computer, we can exploit computer science theory and formal systems theory, two of the shining triumphs of our SAM, to gain insight into question (6). It is worth spending several pages to give some examples of this, in order to illustrate some of the power of our SAM. This will then lead us immediately to questions lying far, far beyond question (6).\nA first example of how to use our SAM to address question (6) is based on the Recursion theorem of computer science theory [104, 13] (sometimes known as Kleene\u2019s second recursion theorem). To begin this example, choose some particular inertial frame to describe physical systems in our universe. (Using this inertial frame will allow us to circumvent the complications of special relativity.) Let V be a special subset of the space-time of our physical universe defined by a cylinder in our chose inertial frame, a cylinder whose base consists of an infinite 3-dimensional region all of whose points have the same value of time, t0, which is long after the Big Bang. Adopt an interpretation of \u201cspecies\u201d in question (6) such that all of its members live their entire lives in V . (This will allow us to circumvent the complications of cosmological issues involving general relativity and the boundary conditions of our physical universe, and will allow us to talk about initializing various physical variables in a computer that resides in V .) For completeness, suppose that V extends infinitely in time.\nAlso suppose that the \u201cone species\u201d mentioned in V can be fully described using a classical coarse-graining of V , so that we can investigate computational issues concerning that species using classical physics. This will allow us to circumvent the complications of quantum mechanics, and in particular of extending\n7There are also major problems with saying that one can find a map from one trajectory of\nvalues of U to one particular trajectory of states of us; see [94]\nvenience, suppose that that one species in question (6) is in fact us humans. In particular, suppose that the conscious experience of humans can be simulated in toto under the coarse-graining of V . So we would never be able to ascertain, by any experiment or other means, that we are not physical systems fully specified by this coarse-grained version of V .\nNext, provisionally adopt the (physical) Church-Turing thesis, that the dynamics of this coarse-grained version of V can be simulated by a classical Turing machine (TM).8 Extend that thesis, to also suppose that there is a subsystem M in V whose dynamics can be interpreted as a universal TM.9 Call this extended version the grounded physical Church-Turing thesis (GPCT). Note that the GPCT implies that we ourselves, resident in V , could be simulations being carried out in that computer, M, which also resides in (what we perceive as) our universe.\nOne might suppose that the GPCT is logically impossible. After all, the \u201cgrounding\u201d part of the GPCT is the assumption V has properly contained within it a physical system that is a universal TM, i.e., that a subset of V was a physical structure M capable of simulating any Turing machine. But the physical ChurchTuring thesis supposes that such an M would be able to simulate all of V . So this M would have to be able to simulate itself at the same time as it is simulating the entire rest of V , outside of M. This would seem to imply a contradiction, that M is more computationally powerful than M is. If this argument were true, the GPCT would be impossible. And so in particular, we could not be part of a simulation by a computer, if that computer were itself contained in our physical universe.\nHowever, the afore-mentioned Recursion theorem of computer science proves that if the GPCT in fact allows there to be be such a physical computer M in our universe, capable of simulating the evolution of the entire universe, including both M itself and us. To sketch this proof, define a (computable) function g that takes two arguments, call them n and w. g works in two steps. First, it decodes n into a specification of an associated TM, Tn. In our context, this means decoding n into the values at t0 of certain physical variables in V whose dynamics we will interpret as running our physical instantiation of the TM Tn. Write Mn for the function that evolves the input to Tn according to the update function of Tn, to a time t f . (Note that at this point in the argument, n is not yet specified \u2014 we are just defining g.) Next, g decodes w to specify two values. The first is t f . The second is the time-t0 values of all the other variables in V (including those that\n8Whether the physical universe obeys the physical Church\u2013Turing thesis has been subject to endless argument [3, 92], especially in the context of quantum mechanics [12, 93, 90]. In particular, some researchers have designed purely theoretical, contrived physical systems that are uncomputable in some sense or other [96, 43, 101] (see also [32]). But for current, illustrative purposes, we can ignore those issues. 9This too is a contentious assumption [81].\ng(n,w) evolves the universe according to the laws of physics from t0 to t f , starting from that decoded version of n and w.\nThe recursion theorem guarantees that there is at least one value n, call it n\u2217, such that Tn\u2217(w) = g(n \u2217 ,w). In other words, if we feed the initial values of all physical variables outside of that physical computer specified by n\u2217 into that physical computer, as the initial state of its input tape, then that computer computes the resultant evolution of V , including itself as well as us. To complete the proof of the claim, we simply identify Tn\u2217 as M.\nThe implication is that it might not only be that we are a simulation in a computer run by aliens in a universe that our universe supervenes on \u2014 we and our entire universe might be a simulation in a computer in our very universe. Theoretically, we might in fact be simulations in a computer that we ourselves run!10\nStranger still, even if we are simulations in a computer in our own universe, that does not rule out the possibility that we and our entire physical universe are also a simulation in some putative computer being run by aliens in a universe that ours supervenes on. In fact, there might be a partial order over a set where each element v in that set specifies a particular universe Uv together with a computer Mv residing in that universe, and where the universes of all the elements v \u2032 \u2264 v are simulations carried out by Mv.\nFormally, this partial order specifies a set of equivalence classes, of pairs v = (Uv,Mv) whose computers can simulate one another. Our use of the recursion theorem shows that in general these equivalence classes contain more than 1 pair each (the may contain an infinite number, in fact). So under the definitions of the terms \u201csimulate\u201d and \u201ccomputer\u201d used in the recursion theorem, answering question (6) is simple; there can be a pair v = (Uv,Mv) that can simulate a pair v\u2032 = (Uv\u2032 ,Mv\u2032) and at the same time v \u2032 can simulate v, while there might also be two pairs v, v\u2032 where v can simulate v\u2032 but not the other way around.\nAs an aside, this partial order has important implications that don\u2019t directly concern question (6), but rather concern the implicit understanding of physical reality that underlies question (6). For any element v\u2032, there will in general be many (maybe even infinitely many) elements v such that v\u2032 \u2264 v. In fact, there may be multiple computers in the same physical universe Uv that can all simulate one another. In other words, by definition (i.e., by the GPCT), there is no experiment we could perform, no observation we could make, that would cause us to conclude that we are simulations in one computer Mv rather than simulations in a different\n10In fact, loosely speaking, one can define \u201cconscious experience\u201d of a person as their thinking about their own thinking. If we do that, we can use the recursion theorem to establish the formal possibility of conscious experience; rather than apply the theorem to a physical computer\u2019s simulating itself as it simulates itself, we consider a physical brain that performs computations (\u201cthinks\u201d) about those computations it is performing.\ncomputer, Mv\u2032 , perhaps residing in a different universe from Uv (but perhaps not!). We could be simulations in multiple computers, and would never be able to pick one of those simulations and say, \u201cthat is us\u201d, be definition. We would be all of those simulations \u201cat once\u201d, so to speak.\nA second set of mathematical arguments also address question (6) but use different definitions of the terms \u2018computer\u2019 and \u2018simulate\u2019. These arguments are arguably more profound than the ones presented above involving the GPCT and the recursion theorem, since they involve the formal systems used to make those arguments.\nTo illustrate these arguments, start by picking some (arbitrary) formal system, so long as that system is powerful enough to be subject to Godel\u2019s incompleteness theorems. These theorems establish that certain propositions statable in that formal system cannot be proven in that formal system. Broadly speaking though, all one needs to do to nullify such a conclusion is to introduce an extra axiom into the formal system that states whether the associated proposition is true or not. Bang \u2014 the apparently paradoxical statement giving the impossibility theorem has been resolved.\nUnfortunately though, the combination of the original formal system with that new axiom is, strictly speaking, a more powerful formal system than the original one. Moreover, that new, more powerful formal system is itself subject to exactly the same kind of Godelian impossibility theorems as those applying to the original formal system, just referring to a different proposition. And of course, those new impossibility theorems in that new formal system could themselves be resolved by introducing yet another axiom, resulting in a yet more powerful formal system [19]. This sequence of increasingly powerful systems has no upper limit \u2014 each new formal system is strictly more powerful than the ones below it whose incompleteness theorems it obviates.\nThese fundamental properties of formal systems provide another way to make question (6) precise. Depending on how precisely one wants to define the word \u201csimulate\u201d, one can identify each member of the sequence of increasingly powerful formal systems with one of the \u201ccomputer simulations produced by sophisticated aliens\u201d in the nested-dolls sequence of simulations considered in [23]. Crucially, no matter how we augment a proof in a formal system, no matter how we combine it with other proofs in that formal system, there will be proofs in the formal systems higher in the hierarchy that it can never replicate.11 In this sense, no\n11Interestingly, while there is no upper limit to this sequence of formal systems / simulations, there is a lower limit; it is the formal system that arises in Godel\u2019s incompleteness theorem, whose axioms include those of Peano\u2019s arithmetic. (In weaker formal systems it is not even be possible to perform Peano arithmetic operations.) In this sense, there is an infinite set of \u201csimulations\u201d that are strictly more computationally powerful than the one giving our physical universe \u2014 but none that we would consider computationally interesting that are weaker.\ntems we ever construct to augment our brains, we will be cognitively weaker than the aliens residing in those other, more powerful formal systems, peering down at us (assuming that the cognitive abilities of those aliens includes deciding all decidable propositions in the formal system that defines us).\nYet another formalization of question (6) involves various \u201creduction hierarchies\u201d (arithmetic and analytic hierarchies, and in their resource-limited forms, the polynomial and exponential hierarchies[41, 63]). The computer science form of these hierarchies involve decision problems which we wish a Turing machine to solve.12 Very loosely speaking, define an \u201coracle\u201d as a system that can instantly decide whether a given decision problem is in some special set \u03b1. Choose a set A \u2282 \u03b1 of the decision problems in \u03b1 that can be decided by a Turing machine subject to a certain time complexity (e.g., polynomial complexity P or nondeterministic complexity NP). Informally, this means that all of the decision problems in A are \u201ceasy\u201d to solve, as far as that Turning machine is concerned, while problems lying outside of A are so difficult as to be effectively impossible to solve. No matter how we program that Turing machine, no matter how we \u201caugment\u201d one program running on it with another one, it will always find problems outside of A effectively impossible.\nNext, define a larger set of problems, B, which contains all the problems in A, and which can be decided with the same time complexity as those in A (i.e., that are \u201cjust as difficult to decide\u201d as those in A), by now allowing that same Turing machine to call an \u201coracle\u201d that can instantly decide whether a given problem is in \u03b1 or not, and do so an arbitrary number of times. This new, souped-up Turing machine, with access to the oracle, is strictly stronger than the original Turing machine, in the simple sense that there is a larger set of decision problems, containing the original set, that are all easy for the new Turing machine. (In contrast, problems in B that are outside of A are strictly harder to decide for the original Turing machine, which did not have access to the oracle.)\nWe can iterate this \u201coracle-izing\u201d procedure, by defining a new oracle that can instantly decide whether a given problem is in B. (Note that \u03b1 \u2286 A \u2286 B.) By allowing our original Turing machine to call this new oracle an arbitrary number of times, we allow it to decide a set of problems, C, which is even larger than B, again with the same time complexity as the original Turing machine decided the original set of problems A. In this way we define an entire infinite \u201chierarchy\u201d of increasingly powerful Turing machines, able to decide an increasingly bigger set of decision problems without expending extra effort. Crucially, no matter how we\n12More formally, they involve bit strings codifying decision problems that must be assigned either the value \u2018true\u2019 or the value \u2018false\u2019 by running an appropriately programmed Turing machine that takes that bit string as input. See [11].\nhow we \u201caugment\u201d it with other programs run on the same machine, there will always be problems that are easy for the Turing machines at higher levels in the hierarchy to solve, but are effectively impossible for any Turing machine at its level.\nThis argument involving hierarchies of increasingly powerful Turing machines,\nable to decide ever larger sets of decision problems with the same amount of effort, is analogous to the argument above concerning a sequence of increasingly powerful formal systems, each of which resolves the impossibility theorems of the formal systems below it in the sequence but is weaker than the formal systems above it. The implication is analogous as well: no matter how we augment our minds \u2014 no matter where we lie in the infinite sequence of ever more powerful oracles \u2014 we will be more limited in our cognitive abilities than the minds higher in the sequence.13 In summary, if we make these other definitions of the words \u2018simulate\u2019 and \u2018computer\u2019, the resultant answers to question (6) strongly suggest that augmenting our brains can never allow us to fully grasp / cognize / perceive our physical reality.\nAll of these arguments concerning question (6) are some examples of the content of our mathematics that suggest that we humans are too limited in our cognitive abilities to cognitively engage with reality in its full extent. Some of these arguments, e.g., the ones invoking Godel\u2019s incompleteness theorems, have been grappled with in the literature for close to a century. However, there are other aspects of our mathematics that instead involve its form, not its content, but which also strongly suggest that we are highly constrained in our cognitive capabilities. I turn attention to these aspects of mathematics next.\nOne of the most powerful fields of mathematics to develop in the past half century is category theory [14, 98]. Category theory provides an extraordinarily concise way of unifying almost all fields of (human) mathematics, ranging from set theory to algebra to topology to analysis. By stripping out the extraneous details, it makes glaringly obvious that all our fields of mathematics are just variants of the same underlying structures, known as \u201ccategories\u201d. What makes category theory so beautiful is that the definition of a category is almost absurdly simple: a category consists of abstract \u201cobjects\u201d, together with ordered pairs of objects, which are called \u201cmorphisms\u201d. There are a few simple requirements imposed on how the morphisms in a category must be related to one another. And that is it. All of our mathematics reduces to embellishments of these simple structures.\nOne response to category theory \u2014 part of the reason it strikes so many peo-\n13More precisely, no matter how we program a Turing machine to exploit whatever oracles our minds have access to, there will be other Turing machines, able to access other oracles, that once they are properly programmed can solve a larger set of decision problems than we can for the same computational effort.\nmany fields of human mathematics, which we are used to viewing as many different types of flower filling a great garden, are in fact many instances of the same underlying, singular plant, planted all over our yard, simply viewed from many different angles. This response might lead one to suppose that the simplicity of category theory reflects some kind of simplicity of mathematical reality.\nHowever, being a bit more objective about things, it might just as well be that the simplicity of the mathematical garden we have tilled reflects a limit of us, the gardeners, not of the number of species of mathematical plant there are. It may be that the reason that our fields of mathematics are all embellishments of a simple underlying structure is that they were created by simple-minded beings: us. It might be that there is a vast expanse of mathematical reality which cannot be expressed in such an extremely simple form, but is intrinsically more complex \u2014 and is forever beyond us.\nThis leads to the following question:\n7. Is the very form of the SAM that we humans have created severely con-\nstrained? So constrained as to suggest that the cognitive abilities of us humans \u2014 those who created that SAM \u2014 is also severely constrained?\nOne does not have to learn category theory to address this question. If one steps back from our SAM, viewing it from afar, one notices that there are striking limitations in how our SAM is formulated, limitations that are common to the SAM produced by almost all human societies. These are limitations in the kinds of patterns with which our SAM is represented. The near universality of these limitations strongly suggests that we humans are incapable of constructing any SAM unless it can be represented using patterns that obey those limitations \u2014 that the limitations are an unavoidable inheritance of the Veldt-designed cognitive capabilities of our distant ancestors. These limitations in how SAM is represented have long been explicitly recognized, and in fact are central to how modern mathematicians and philosophers conceive of mathematics \u2014 it\u2019s just that nobody has emphasized that they are limitations.\nAs was explicitly recognized at least as far back as Wittgenstein [21, 100, 113], all of human mathematics consists of discrete sequences of clearly delineated patterns composed either of marks on a surface or words in speech. All statements in mathematics consist of finite sequences of elements from a finite set; e.g., \u201c1 + 1 = 2\u201d is a sequence of five elements from a finite set of symbols. All proofs in mathematics \u2014 all theorems based on Zermelo \u2014 Fraenkel Choice (ZFC) set theory, all predicate logics, all category theory \u2014 comprise a finite discrete sequence of such statements.\nformal understanding of the foundations of physical reality, is written in the language of our mathematics [74, 109, 110, 123]. Even if we consider the less formal sciences, they are still formulated in terms of human language, in addition to mathematics \u2014 and therefore in terms of finite strings of symbols, since like mathematics, human language comprises finite strings of symbols. Our evident restriction to manipulating such strings is a major limitation on how we represent both mathematical and physical reality.\nMuch of philosophy has reacted to this observation, that our SAM is just a set of finite sequences of symbols, by trying to unpack / formalize the precise way that such finite sequences can \u201crefer to something outside of themselves.\u201d 14 The community of mathematicians has reacted in a similar way, expanding formal logic to include modern model theory [71] and meta-mathematics [76].\nArguably though, what is truly stunning about the fact that modern SAM is formulated in terms of finite sequences is its exclusivity; nothing other than such finite chains of symbols is ever found anywhere in modern mathematical reasoning. So fundamental is this restriction in current mathematical reasoning that it has implicitly been enshrined in our current definition of such reasoning via the Church-Turing thesis 15.\nThis gives rise to our next question:\n8. Is this restriction to finite sequences somehow a necessary feature of any\ncomplete formulation of physical reality? Or does it instead reflect a limitation of how we humans can formalize any aspect of reality, i.e., is it a limitation of our brains?\nThis question, in turn, immediately gives rise to many others:\n9. In standard formulations of mathematics, a mathematical proof is a finite\nsequence of \u201cwell-formed sentences\u201d, each of which is itself a finite string of symbols. All of mathematics is a set of such proofs. How would our perception of reality differ if, rather than just finite sequences of finite symbol strings, the mathematics underlying our conception of reality was expanded\n14To appreciate some of the difficulty of this problem, note that any sequence of symbols has no more significance in and of itself about any one specific mathematical or physical object than do the sequences one might find in the entrails of a sacrificed sheep, or in the sequence of cracks in a heated tortoise shell. How to circumvent this issue is called the \u201csymbol-grounding problem\u201d in philosophy [56, 67]. 15My concern here is not whether the Church-Turing thesis is true, or what its implications would be for whether there can be a physical computer in our universe that simulates the evolution of our entire universe, including that computer itself. My concern now is more fundamental, with whether the implicit assumption of the thesis, that the physical universe can be formulated in terms of a set of sequences of symbols, is valid.\nsion in finite time? Phrased concretely, how would our cognitive abilities change if our brains could implement, or at least encompass, super-Turing abilities, sometimes called \u201chyper-computation\u201d (e.g., as proposed in computers that are on rockets moving arbitrarily close to the speed of light [2])?\nGoing further, as we currently conceive of mathematics, it is possible to embody all of its theorems, even those with infinitely long proofs, in a single countably infinite sequence: the successive digits of Chaitin\u2019s omega [80]. (This is a consequence of the Church-Turing thesis.) How would mathematics differ from our current conception of it if it were actually an uncountably infinite collection of such countably infinite sequences rather than just one, a collection which could not be combined to form a single, countably infinite sequence? Could we ever tell the difference? Could a being with superTuring capabilities tell the difference, even if the Church-Turing thesis is true, and even if we cannot tell the difference?\nGoing yet further, what would mathematics be if, rather than countable sequences of finite symbol strings, it involved uncountable sequences of such symbol strings? In other words, what if not all proofs were a discrete sequence of well-formed finite sentences, the successive sentences being indexed by counting integers, but rather some proofs were continuous sequences of sentences, the successive sentences being indexed by real numbers? Drilling further into the structure of proofs, what if some of the \u201cwellformed sentences\u201d occurring in a proof\u2019s sequence of sentences were not a finite sequence of symbols, but rather an uncountably infinite set of symbols?16 If each sentence in a proof consisted of an uncountably infinite set of symbols, and in addition the sentences in the proof were indexed by a range of real numbers, then (formally speaking) the proof would be a curve \u2014 a one-dimensional object \u2014 traversing a two-dimensional space. Going even further, what would it mean if somehow the proofs in God\u2019s book [6] were inherently multidimensional objects, not reducible to linearly ordered sequences of symbols, embedded in a space of more than two dimensions?\nWe can go even further than this set of issues. As mathematics is currently understood, the sequence of symbol strings in any proof must, with probability 1, obey certain constraints. Proofs are the outcomes of deductive reasoning, and so certain sequences of symbol strings are \u201cforbidden\u201d, i.e.,\n16It should be noted that there has been some research on logical systems in which the individual sentences are allowed to involve countably infinite sequences of symbols [1]. Of course, even this \u201cinfinitary logic\u201d is formulated in terms of (finite sequences of) finite sequences of symbols, i.e., the equations defining infinitary logic, and the resultant formal investigations of infinintary logic, all occur in papers and textbooks that are finite.\nematics were dynamically generated in a stochastic process, and therefore unavoidably random, with no sequence assigned probability 0 [123, 36, 51, 59]? Might that, in fact, be how our mathematics has been generated? What would it be like to inhabit a physical universe whose laws could not be represented unless one used such a mathematics [44, 61, 62]? Might that, in fact, be the universe that we do inhabit, but due to limitations in our minds, we cannot even conceive of all that extra stochastic structure, never mind recognize it?\nAs a final leap, note that all of the suggested extensions of the form of current human mathematics I have just described are themselves presented in terms of ... human mathematics. Embellished with colloquial language, I described those extensions by using the formal concepts of uncountable infinity, multidimensionality, Turing machines, and stochastic processes \u2014 all of which are constructions of human mathematics, and so involving finite sets of finite sequences of symbols. What would a mathematics be like whose very form could not be described using a finite sequence of symbols from a finite alphabet?\nTo gain some insight into these questions, note that the highly limited form of all of human mathematics \u2014 sequences of finite strings of symbols \u2014 just happens to be exactly the structure that we humans use to converse with one another: the structure of human language. Indeed, starting back with Wittgenstein, it has become commonplace to identify mathematics as a special case of human language, casting its structure explicitly as grammar in the same sense as grammars arise in human conversation. Note as well that it is a poetic cliche that libraries, and in particular mathematics libraries, are places where we converse (!) with past minds. The implication is that the contents of all the mathematics textbooks in those libraries is part of a conversation; i.e., an exercise in human language. Indeed, historically, mathematics textbooks and papers developed from written correspondence, i.e., from exercises in human language.\nSo, the form of human mathematics, and of our SAM more generally, just happens to exactly coincide with the form of inter-human communication. Some writers have pointed this out before, that human language\u2019s design matches that of formal logic and Turing machine theory [18]. They have taken this as a wonderful stroke of fortune, that we just so happen have a cognitive prosthesis \u2014 human language \u2014 that is capable of capturing formal logic. After all \u2014 they presume \u2014 this means we are capable of capturing all the laws of the physical universe.\nA cynic might comment with heavy irony, \u201cGee, how lucky can you get? Humans have exactly the cognitive capabilities needed to capture all aspects of physical reality, and not a drop more!\u201d This cynic might go on to wonder whether\nof pheromone trails, would conclude that it is a great stroke of fortune that they happen to have the cognitive capability of doing precisely that; or whether a phototropic plant would conclude that it is a stroke of fortune that they happen to have the cognitive capability to track the sun, since that must mean that they can formulate the rules of the universe.\nSure, it\u2019s possible that it is just a coincidence, that for some unknown reason the deepest nature of physical reality is expressible in terms of one of our cognitive prostheses. But it certainly seems as plausible that social computation is simply the most sophisticated cognitive prosthesis we have ever developed, and that even exploiting it to the hilt only allows us to capture a sliver of physical reality. Yes, our science and mathematics \u2014 or more precisely, what they seem to be developing into \u2014 may be a complete description of what we understand physical reality to be. They might be developing into a complete description of what is experimentally accessible to us, even if only indirectly, both now and in the future [109, 110, 123, 124]. But in an exactly parallel manner, a putative antlevel theory of reality in terms of pheromone trails and environmental chemical signals could capture all that ants \u201cunderstand physical reality to be\u201d, of all that ants can \u201cexperimentally access\u201d. And just as there is a huge expanse of physical reality lying beyond the charmed sliver that ants can conceive of, it may be that there is a huge expanse of physical reality beyond our ability to even conceive of.\nAfter all, social computation \u2014 human language \u2014 was developed for com-\nmunal sessions of shooting the shit around the campfire after a successful mastodon hunt (plus a few other purposes). There is no reason to believe that features wellsuited for such exercises in nocturnal braggadocio can also be used to glean substantial insights into the shape of the hands of the Cosmic Baker, based solely on some crumbs we have discovered, scattered on their kitchen floor.\nNoam Chomsky [35], Daniel Dennett [46] and others [48] have marveled at the fact that human language allows recursion, i.e., that it allows arbitrary finite, discrete sequences of symbols from a finite alphabet. They marvel at the fact that humans can create any of a countable number of sentences, viewing this as allowing an amazingly large set of human languages. In contrast, I marvel at how restricted human language is, and so how restricted human SAM is. I marvel at the fact that that limitation appears to be universal. After all, suppose that it were the case that all of physical reality could in fact be formulated in terms of some finite sequence of symbol strings from a finite alphabet. Even so, it would still be striking that, as humans converge to that correct formulation, we have never considered formulations that are not representable this way, perhaps due to considering an erroneous SAM, or perhaps due to choosing an inefficient representation of SAM. I marvel at the small size of the sandbox we play in while formulating our SAM.\n10. Is it a lucky coincidence that all of mathematical and physical reality can\nbe formulated in terms of our current cognitive abilities, including, in particular, the most sophisticated cognitive prosthesis we currently possess: human language? Or is it just that, tautologically, we cannot conceive of any aspects of mathematical and physical reality that cannot be formulated in terms of our cognitive capabilities?\nTo gain some appreciation for this question, note that (presumably) no paramecium can even conceive of the concept of a \u201cquestion,\u201d concerning issues that have no direct impact on its behavior, despite how obvious that concept seems to us. Not only would a paramecium not understand the possible answers we have considered for our questions concerning reality, it would not understand the questions, as has often been noted [25, 24]. More fundamentally though, no paramecium can even conceive of the idea of posing a question concerning physical reality in the first place. Insofar as the cognitive concept of questions and answers might be a crucial tool to any understanding of physical reality, a paramecium is, by construction, lacking the tools needed to understand physical reality. It presumably does not even understand what \u201cunderstanding reality\u201d means, in the sense that we mean the term. Ultimately, this is due to limitations in the very kind of cognitive capabilities of paramecia. And as just argued, we, too, almost surely have limitations in the very kind of our cognitive capabilities. So, the next (ironically self-referential) question in this essay:\n11. Are there cognitive constructs of some sort, as fundamental as the very idea\nof questions and answers, that are necessary for understanding physical reality, and that are forever beyond our ability to even imagine due to the limitations of our brains, just as the notion of a question is forever beyond a paramecium?\nIt may help to clarify this question by emphasizing what it is not. This question does not concern limitations on what we can know about what it is that we can never know.17 Many things can be conceived by us humans even if they can never be known by us. The set of what it is that we cannot even conceive of is a (strictly smaller) subset of what it is that we cannot know. The issue I am concerned with is what we can ever perceive concerning that smaller set, the set of all that we cannot conceive of.\nFor example, I am not concerned here with the unknowables of how other branches of the many worlds of quantum mechanics turn out [54]. Nor am I\n17I am using the term \u201cknow\u201d loosely here, since the distinctions between its various possible\nformal definitions [55] are not relevant to my arguments.\ncannot directly observe them, e.g., values of variables concerning events outside of our Hubble sphere, or events within the event horizon of a black hole, or events like how many cells were in a dinosaur named \u201cBob\u201d who lived in 90 million BC, spending his whole life right where my house is now. The first one is calculable, in theory at least, even if not observable, and so is arguably knowable. The remaining three are not reflections of limits of our cognitive abilities \u2014 we can certainly conceive of those variables and their values without any difficulty. Rather, they can never be known by us for the simple reason that our ancillary engineering capabilities are not up to the task, not for any reasons intrinsic to limitations of the science and math our minds can construct. They can be known, but we cannot find a path to such knowledge.\nAlso, I am not concerned here with the limitations of what can be known by humans that arise from the logical nature of self-referentiality, nor the limitations of Tarski [105] or Rice [72] or Chaitin [18, 32]. Indeed, the simple fact that we can prove that we cannot have this kind of knowledge means that we can conceive of having it. The impossibility theorems of Godel and the computational hierarchies discussed shortly after question (6) are not the issues I wish to highlight at this point \u2014 after all, I am able to describe those kinds of unknowability. The concern here is what kinds of unknowable cognitive constructs might exist that we can never even be aware of, never mind describe (and never mind implement!).\nIn addition, I am not concerned with what cannot be known with complete assurance, for essentially statistical reasons. For example, I am not here concerned with the fact we can never be 100%, cross-my-heart-and-hope-to-die sure that a proof we write down has no logical errors, no matter how many times other people and computer programs might check it. It is conceivable that this limitation of what is knowable would apply no matter what kind of intelligence we had \u2014 whether we were beings far advanced evolutionarily from Homo sapiens or were just lowly paramecia.\nSimilarly, I am not here concerned with the theoretical impossibility of inductive inference. I am not concerned with the fact that if one restricts attention to future experiments, then, as Hume intuited [73], there is no assumption-free way to establish the validity of the scientific method [122, 121]. I am not concerned with the fact that none of machine learning can be formally justified in a non-trivial sense without making assumptions [116, 115, 121], that black-box optimization algorithms like simulated annealing cannot be justified without making assumptions [117], or that the use of Monte Carlo techniques to estimate expected values of functions cannot be justified without making assumptions [122].\nNor am I concerned with the kinds of impossibility results that would apply to any physical universe, regardless of its laws of physics, so long as entities within that physical universe could both encode questions concerning the state of that\nputability theory and mathematical logic mentioned above, these impossibilities lie within the remit of current (meta)mathematics rather than outside of it.\nI am concerned with \u2014 and I wish to draw attention to \u2014 the issue of whether there are cognitive constructs that we cannot conceive of but that are as crucial to understanding physical reality as is the simple construct of a question. The paramecium cannot even conceive of the cognitive construct of a \u201cquestion\u201d in the first place, never mind formulate or answer a question; are there, similarly, cognitive constructs that we cannot conceive of, but that are just as necessary to knowing all of physical reality as is the simple idea of questions and answers? I am emphasizing the possibility of things that are knowable, but not to us, because we are not capable of conceiving of that kind of knowledge in the first place.\nBefore proceeding, at this point it\u2019s important to address the conundrum that \u2014 of course \u2014 this entire essay is itself a sequence of sentences written in English. My arguments in this essay are themselves a \u201cfinite sequence of finite sequences of symbols, all those symbols from the same finite alphabet\u201d. But the argument I\u2019m making in this essay is that any argument couched exclusively in terms of sequences of symbols may be deficient, unable to capture all (or even most) of reality. (This essay is, loosely speaking, itself an example of self-reference.) In particular, if one accepts the argument of this essay, one concludes that there may be aspects of reality beyond the remit of that argument. Moreover, a priori, those aspects of reality beyond the remit of the argument in this essay may obviate that very argument. Cutting to the nub of it: the argument in this essay argues that that argument might be incomplete.\nMathematicians are well versed in such logical conundrums. Go\u0308del\u2019s first incompleteness theorem applies to all any logical system at least powerful enough to describe simple arithmetic with the integers. The first theorem constructs a \u201cGo\u0308del sentence\u201d, s, in any such logical system T , a sentence which can most naturally be interpreted as saying that s cannot be proven in T . Colloquially, the Go\u0308del sentence is: \u201cThis sentence cannot be proven in T\u201d. To avoid a logical contradiction, it would seem that one must interpret this sentence to actually be true (an interpretation which was formally established later with Rosser\u2019s famous \u201ctrick\u201d). So, by the first incompleteness theorem, any logically consistent reasoning system is incomplete, not able to prove every true sentence without introducing contradictions.\nNeedless to say, this incompleteness theorem does not prevent mathematicians from having complete confidence that the theorems they derive using the standard logical systems of mathematics are indeed true. The fact that if they wish to form a complete theory there may be some other truth contradicting their theorems, a truth which their logical system cannot derive, does not prevent them from having this confidence.\nficiently powerful logical system T can contain a proof saying that T is free of logical contradictions, no matter what precise mathematical axioms T contains. One needs to introduce the lack of contradictions in T as an additional axiom to establish that T is free of contradictions. But that just means that we have replaced T with a stronger logical system, T \u2032, and T \u2032 cannot prove that it is free of contradictions (even though it can prove that about T ). We have an infinite regress, with no logical system T able to validate all theorems derived in T . But again, this does not prevent mathematicians from going about their business as usual, as though there are no contradictions lurking out there that invalidate the theorems they construct.\nThese two incompleteness theorems of Go\u0308del are results in what is called \u2018meta-mathematics\u2019, the mathematics of math itself. These two theorems (and many similar ones) tell us that mathematicians have no choice but to rely on what is called \u201cnatural language\u201d when they investigate meta-mathematics, a language that is not fully formal. Mathematicians have no choice but to rely on \u201cpre-theoretical concepts of rationality\u201d [47]. But that is not sufficient reason for mathematicians to doubt the theorems that they collectively derive. Similarly, it is not sufficient reason to doubt the arguments in this essay \u2014 yes,\nThis phenomenon is rife in all of modern science, in fact, not just mathematics. For example, quantum mechanics tells us that there is a tiny-teeny probability that as you\u2019re sitting on a sofa a lion will materialize out of thin air right next to you on the sofa. But this does not prevent physicists from confidently sitting in sofas without taking measures to protect themselves from possible attack by a neighboring feline carnivore. The sole fact that some rather inconvenient fact may be true (whether it be a lip-smacking lion suddenly staring you in the face or a mathematical truth that nullifies the beautiful theorem you think you just derived) does not cause modern scientists to pay any attention to it. The bar for paying attention to a fact is higher than it simply being possible. Results like those of Go\u0308del are similar, just bereft of the tool of probability theory which we use to at least get a handle on these conundrums in quantum mechanics.\nThe argument of this essay, saying that arguments consisting only of finite sequences of symbols are almost unavoidably incomplete, has this very nature. It is very similar to a Go\u0308del sentence, like the ones defined in his first incompleteness theorem. The implication of Go\u0308del\u2019s second incompleteness theorem is the same: yes, there may be aspects of reality that nullify this argument that finite sentences do not suffice. But that simple possibility of such an aspect of reality that would nullify this argument, by itself, provides no justification for disbelieving this argument. (Just like the possibility of contradictions in a proof presented by a mathematician is not sufficient reason for other mathematicians to ignore that proof.) Perhaps the most important lesson of the breakthroughs in our 20th\ngrapple with the truly interesting issues in life, the deep issues, the issues lying beyond the nose in front of our collective face.\nAdopting this lesson, we are now led to an issue that was briefly discussed above, in question (4): How might the set of what-we-can-conceive evolve in the future? Suppose that, indeed, the kinds of knowledge concerning mathematical and physical reality that our current brains can conceive of having is a proper subset of all of the kinds of knowledge there are. In other words, suppose the set of what-can-be-known-but-not-even-conceived-by-us is non-empty. This leads to a new question, the final one of this essay:\n12. Is there any way that we imagine testing \u2014 or at least gaining insight into\n\u2014 whether our SAM can, in the future, capture all of physical reality? If not, is there any way of gaining insight into how much of reality is forever beyond our ability to even conceive of? In short, what can we ever know about the nature of that which we cannot conceive of?\nOf course, there is a deep irony in even posing this question. As argued above, the ways that a paramecium can conceive of coming to grips with the full nature of physical reality are extraordinarily limited (perhaps involving chemotaxis and the like). Worse, we humans know that those possible conceptions by a paramecium are irrelevant to understanding physical reality. I then gave as an example that a paramecium cannot even conceive of questions and their answers. The supposition being that questions are one of the true ways to understand reality... It\u2019s hard not to see the immediate analogy: just as a paramecium is wrong in its (imputed, implicit) view of what is important to comprehend physical reality, as is obvious to a creature more intelligent than it is, so we may be wrong in our view of what is important to comprehend physical reality \u2014 as would be obvious to a creature more intelligent than we are. So in particular, asking questions \u2014 precisely as I am doing in this essay \u2014 might be completely wrong-headed, irrelevant to engaging cognitively with physical reality.\nBe that as it may, asking questions has gotten us this far, so let\u2019s run with them\na bit longer. So: What can we say about question [12]?\nFirst, from a certain perspective this question might appear to be a scientific version of a conspiracy theory, writ large. One might argue that it is no different in kind from the fact that: you can never prove that ghosts don\u2019t exist, either theoretically or empirically; that Marduk doesn\u2019t really pull the strings in human affairs, nor does an Abrahamic deity; that it is not actually the believers in QAnon who are members of a secret cabal of Satan-worshiping cannibalistic pedophiles running a global child sex-trafficking ring and engaged in a massive (highly successful) disinformation campaign.\nunconceivable aspects to reality. We can\u2019t somehow prove that there aren\u2019t. But by definition, we could never know such unconceivables \u2014 could never investigate them empirically \u2014 so who cares?\u201d Isn\u2019t the ending question of this essay about can-never-be-conceived aspects of reality just a pompously inflated version of the platitude that you can\u2019t prove a negative? The famous scalpel of Occam suggests you should expunge consideration of such a proposition from your intellectual todo list. Just as the scalpel denigrates the proposition that there is an Abrahamic deity in the sense that is defended by Deists, deriding that proposition as vacuous, said scalpel also suggests that the final question of this essay is vacuous, with no consequences (by definition), and therefore unworthy of contemplation.\nHowever, even if we there are aspects of reality that will forever lie beyond our ken, that does not mean that might have consequences which have major empirical consequences for us. For example, consider those aspects of our physical universe that will forever characterize as \u201crandom\u201d (in the case of quantum mechanics) or \u201cbeyond our ability to calculate\u201d (e.g., due to intrinsic chaos, or simply because the calculation would require more iterations of a Turing machine than could be run before the heat death of the universe), or \u201carbitrary\u201d (e.g., the physical constants of nature, or the details of the universe\u2019s boundary conditions). There may even be physical phenomena that are neither deterministic nor stochastic, e.g., computationally undecidable, but whose existence has major empirical consequences for us.\nOn the other hand, it may also be that if we simply had sufficient cognitive capability, the mystery of all such phenomena would be resolved for us, and we would be able to understand / predict them in full. So even if we cannot answer the question I am posing in this essay, that answer might have hugely consequential implications for what we observe around us.\nMoreover, there are at least five reasons to suspect that we actually can find the answer to (some aspects of) the question I am posing in this essay, which salvages the question from the realm of such vacuities:\ni) Most prosaically, we may be able to make some inroads into what is cur-\nrently beyond our ability to conceive of we can ever somehow construct a super-Turing computer [4] and exploit it to consider the question of what knowledge can never be conceived by us, thereby breaking free of the strictures of the Church-Turing thesis.\nii) More speculatively, our cognitive abilities will presumably continue to grow,\ne.g., by our constructing new kinds of external information retrieval and processing systems (earlier examples of which are books, then computers, and now the web), or by our building neurobiological prostheses, directly connected to our brains. These new abilities might at least be able to establish\nsimulational / theoretical / who knows? process. In other words, it may be that the feedback loop between our extended minds and our technology does let us break free of the evolutionary accident \u2014 of the fact that our minds were formed for the Veldt \u2014 at least in certain regards. It may be that the answer to question 4 above is \u201cno\u201d \u2014 and this may have consequences.\niii) Suppose we figure out how to communicate with \u201calien intelligences\u201d here\non Earth. For example, we may figure out how to communicate with Cetaceans, or with the (still very speculative) \u201cwood-wide web\u201d of communities of trees in forests who communicate with another both directly and via mycorrhizal networks. One could imagine that these terrestrial alien intelligences might be able to answer the question I am posing.\niv) Suppose we encounter extraterrestrial intelligence, e.g., by plugging into\nsome vast galaxy-wide web of interspecies discourse, containing in particular some cosmic version of Stack Exchange. To answer the question \u2014 to determine whether there are aspects of physical reality that are knowable but that we humans cannot even conceive of that kind of knowledge \u2014 might require nothing more than our posing that question to the cosmic Stack Exchange, and then reading through the answers that get posted.\nv) Consider our evolutionary progeny \u2014 not just future variants of our species\nthat evolve from us via conventional Neo-Darwinian (epi)genetic mutation, crossover, and selection, but future members of any species (organic and/or inorganic) that we consciously design.18 It seems quite likely that the minds of such successors of ours will have a larger set of things that can be conceived than we do. After all, the decades-long experiments conducted in\n18To give a simple example, it seems highly likely that within the next few decades very many people will start to apply gene-editing techniques (e.g., via CRISPR) to the human germ line, in order to make babies with super-human intelligence. Or to give another example, vast numbers of increasingly powerful AIs that learn from experience will soon be engaging with another via mechanisms like smart contracts \u2014 in other words, they will engaging with one another in completely arbitrary processes that they themselves design. Keeping that thought in mind, recall that in 2010, when a relatively small number of very dumb trading bots interacted with one another via a highly constrained set of protocols, the result was the flash crash, wiping 1000 points off the Dow stock index in a matter of minutes \u2014 and then recovering just as fast . Note that we still have no formal understanding of just what happened in the flash crash [75]. (That\u2019s why with the exception of some crude restrictions that were imposed in Singapore in response to a later crash, no regulations have been implemented to prevent bot-caused flash crashes from occurring again.) What will future versions of \u201cflash crashes\u201d be, when we replace those simple bots with future AIs, and allow them to interact arbitrarily, via smart contracts? These future AI-ecosystem eruptions will very likely be far, far beyond our understanding ... and in many ways may constitute intelligences, far \u201cadvanced\u201d above our own.\nintervention (relying solely on the proverbial Neo-Darwinian \u201cblind watchmaker\u201d to guide the evolution, albeit a sped-up watchmaker), there is unceasing growth in adaptive fitness. There is no reason to believe that this would not also apply to cognitive \u201cfitness.\u201d (See the discussion above of a time-series analysis of the set of cognitive capabilities of terrestrial species.)\nIn addition, the successors that we design would be an evolutionary first: a species directly constructed in a goal-oriented, Lamarkian manner. This novelty in how our descendant species will be constructed may mean that their cognitive \u201cgenotype\u201d will have jumped out of our current metastable state [5, 82]. The jump from us to them may be a massive punctuated equilibrium, overcoming the limitations imposed on us by the frozen accidents in our evolutionary past.\nIt seems likely that these children of ours, with their attendant cognitive advances beyond us, will be here within 50 \u2014 100 years. Presumably we will go extinct soon after their arrival (like all good parents making way for their children). So, on our way out the door, as we gaze up at our successors in open-mouthed wonder, as one of our last acts:\nWe can simply ask our question of them."
