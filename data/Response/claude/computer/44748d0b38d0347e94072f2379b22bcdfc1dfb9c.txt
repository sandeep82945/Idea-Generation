 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Developing standardized data exchange protocols and ontologies to improve interoperability of data from various sources like BIM, COBie, IoT sensors, etc. This could help seamlessly integrate data into the digital twin.

2. Testing the proposed digital twin framework on real-world case studies of cubic facilities to evaluate and refine the framework. Different building types could be explored.

3. Exploring the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to enhance data analysis, pattern recognition, predictive capabilities etc. of the digital twin. This could improve decision-making.

4. Researching solutions to simplify the digital twin interface and tools so it can be operated by facility managers with basic digital skills, not just experts. Democratizing access is key.

5. Comparative assessment of digital twin benefits versus costs over the entire lifecycle of a facility. This could demonstrate ROI and lead to greater industry adoption.
