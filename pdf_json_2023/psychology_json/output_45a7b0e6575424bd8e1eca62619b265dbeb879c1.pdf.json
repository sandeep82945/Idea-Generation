    "abstractText": "Resveratrol, a naturally occurring stilbene, exhibits numerous beneficial health effects. Various studies have demonstrated its diverse biological actions, including anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-platelet properties, thereby supporting its potential for cardio protection, neuroprotection, and anti-cancer activity. However, a significant limitation of resveratrol is its weak bioavailability. To overcome this challenge, multiple research groups have investigated the synthesis of new resveratrol derivatives to enhance bioavailability and pharmacological activities. Nevertheless, there are limited data on the effects of resveratrol derivatives on platelet function. Therefore, the objective of this study was to synthesize resveratrol methoxy derivatives and evaluate their anti-platelet and anti-proliferative activity. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) obtained from healthy volunteers was utilized to assess the derivatives\u2019 ability to inhibit platelet aggregation induced by platelet activating factor (PAF), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and thrombin receptor activating peptide (TRAP). Additionally, the derivatives\u2019 anti-tumor activity was evaluated against the proliferation of PC-3 and HCT116 cells. The results revealed that some methoxy derivatives of resveratrol exhibited comparable or even superior anti-platelet activity compared to the original compound. The most potent derivative was the 4\u2032-methoxy derivative, which demonstrated approximately 2.5 orders of magnitude higher anti-platelet activity against TRAP-induced platelet aggregation, indicating its potential as an antiplatelet agent. Concerning in silico studies, the 4\u2032-methyl group of 4\u2032-methoxy derivative is oriented similarly to the fluorophenyl\u2013pyridyl group of Vorapaxar, buried in a hydrophobic cavity. In terms of their anti-tumor activity, 3-MRESV exhibited the highest potency in PC-3 cells, while 3,4\u2032-DMRESV and TMRESV showed the greatest efficacy in HCT116 cells. In conclusion, methoxy derivatives of resveratrol possess similar or improved anti-platelet and anti-cancer effects, thereby holding potential as bioactive compounds in various pathological conditions.",

            "text": "Resveratrol is a naturally occurring stilbene with several beneficial health effects [1,2]. It is most commonly in grapes and wine but also in other plants such as polygonum cuspidatum, peanuts, and red fruits [2]. It exists in two diastereoisomeric forms found in nature: transform (E-1,2-diphenylethylene) and cis-form (Z-1,2-triphenylethylene), with the former being the bioactive arrangement. One hydroxyl group is present in one ring, in position 4\u2032, and two hydroxyl groups are present in the other ring, in positions 3 and 5, respectively. The study of its biological actions expanded after the introduction of the term \u201cFrench Paradox\u201d in 1992 by Renaud S and De Lorgeril [3]. Since then, several studies have shown\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5547. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28145547 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5547 2 of 16\nthat resveratrol exhibits a wide range of biological actions, including anti-oxidant, antiinflammatory, and anti-platelet properties that support its cardioprotective, neuroprotective, and anti-cancer effects [4\u20136]. In this line, our previous study revealed that resveratrol possesses potent anti-oxidant activities since it could scavenge free radicals, inhibit LOX, and inhibits serum oxidation induced by Cu2+ and binds Fe2+ [7]. We have also shown that resveratrol has potent anti-platelet and anti-inflammatory activities since it inhibits platelet activating factor (PAF)-induced washed rabbit platelet aggregation [8] and PAF biosynthetic enzymes in unstimulated and IL-1-stimulated U937 monocytes cells [9,10] and possesses anti-cancer effects [11]. It should be noted that PAF is a potent lipid mediator of inflammation and platelet aggregation that participates in atherosclerosis, cancer, and neurodegeneration [12\u201314]. Although resveratrol has potent biological activities, its water solubility results in weak bioavailability [15]. To overcome this problem, several research groups have studied the synthesis of new resveratrol derivatives in order to enhance their bioavailability and pharmacological efficacy [16,17]. Recent reports indicate that resveratrol derivatives with methoxy, hydroxy, acetyl, or halogen groups could be potential agents against inflammation, cancer, neuron damage, and microbial or fungal infections [18,19]. Among them, methylation of aromatic hydroxyl groups consists of a promising structural modification. The O-methylation in the stilbene ring increases lipophilicity and has been shown to promote cell uptake, protect from degradation, and improve stability [20,21]. Also, methoxy derivatives revealed greater bioavailability and total plasma levels of the parent compound in rats [22,23]. Limited data exist regarding the effects of resveratrol derivatives on platelet function. Platelets are small discoid cytoplasmic fragments that come from megakaryocytes or lung cells. They do not have a nucleus, but they retain the ability for mRNA and protein synthesis [24]. Platelets are crucial in primary hemostasis and thrombus formation, but recent evidence suggests their involvement in diseases such as atherosclerosis, cancer, diabetes, and neurodegeneration [25]. We have previously shown that resveratrol acetylated derivatives could inhibit platelet aggregation against PAF [26]; however, there is only one recent study that found that the 3,5,2\u2032,4\u2032-tetramethoxy derivative of resveratrol inhibits thrombin-induced platelet aggregation [27]. Furthermore, the connection between inflammation and malignancy is now wellrecognized. Platelets play significant roles in cancer progression by providing surface and granular contents for several interactions as well as behaving like immune cells. Antiplatelet agents may prevent cancer, decrease tumor growth and metastatic potential, and improve cancer patients\u2019 survival [28,29]. Therefore, the present study aims to synthesize methoxy derivatives in the existing hydroxyl groups of resveratrol and to evaluate their anti-platelet and anti-cancer properties."

Resveratrol (6) was prepared using previously published procedures with slight modifications [30]. The process begins with the preparation of 3,5-dimethoxybenzylphosphonate 4, which involves the reduction of benzoic acid 1 with LiAlH4 to afford benzyl alcohol 2. Compound 2 was then reacted with CBr4 in the presence of PPh3, and the resulting bromide 3 is then reacted with PO(OEt)3 to yield the desired phosphonate 4. A Wittig reaction of compound 4 with 4-methoxybenzaldehyde produces trimethoxyresveratrol 5, which is further demethoxylated by treatment with BBr3, to obtain resveratrol 6. Acetylation of resveratrol leads to a mixture of isomeric mono- di- or tri-acetylated resveratrol 7a\u2013e, which are separated by column chromatography and identified through 1D- and 2D-NMR experiments. The target methoxy compounds 9a\u2013d are obtained from the mono- and diacetylated resveratrol analogs (7a,b and 7c,d, respectively) upon methylation and hydrolysis of the resulting methoxy analogs 8a\u2013c.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5547 3 of 16\nMolecules 2023, 27, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 17\nmono- di- or tri-acetylated resveratrol 7a\u2013e, which are separated by column chromatography and identified through 1D- and 2D-NMR experiments.

When methylation occurred in the 4\u2032-hydroxyl group, i.e., the 4\u2032 derivative (p = 0.13), the 3,4\u2032 derivative (p = 1.0), and the 3,4\u2032,5 derivative (p = 1.0), the IC50 values were higher but not significantly different from the initial compound. When the IC50 values were calculated based on the AUC of aggregation instead of amplitude, only methylation occurring in the 3\u2032-hydroxyl group (p < 0.000) revealed a significant increase in IC50 value compared to resveratrol. Regarding PAF as the agonist, methylation also worsened the ability of resveratrol to inhibit platelet aggregation (p < 0.000). Specifically, methylation in both aromatic rings (3- and 4\u2032-hydroxyl groups) resulted in significantly higher IC50 values compared to the initial compound, as did trimethylation (3,4\u2032-DMRESV p < 0.000, TMRESV p = 0.01). When methylation occurred only in one ring, no significant change was observed in IC50 values, although a slight increase was observed (3-MRESV p = 0.5, 4\u2032-MRESV p = 0.4, 3,5-DMResv p = 0.3). Similar results were obtained when the IC50 values were calculated based on the AUC of aggregation instead of the amplitude (3,4-DMRESV p = 0.002, TMRESV p = 0.06, all the others p > 0.05). In contrast, when TRAP was used as the agonist, methylation of resveratrol improved its ability to inhibit platelet aggregation. The monomethylated derivatives exhibited the best inhibitory ability, with almost one magnitude lower IC50 values, namely 3-MRESV (p < 0.000) and two 4\u2032-MRESV (p < 0.000), respectively, compared to resveratrol. Dimethylation occurring in different rings resulted in a lower IC50 value (3,4\u2032-DMRESV, p = 0.01), whereas when it occurred in the same ring, a similar IC50 was observed to the initial compound\u2019s anti-platelet activity (3,5-DMRESV, p = 0.1). Figure 1 shows a characteristic inhibition of TRAP-induced platelet aggregation by 4\u2032-MRESV. The trimethylation of resveratrol dramatically diminished its inhibitory activity, and the IC50 value could not be calculated.

Vorapaxar, unlike ligands for other GPCRs, does not penetrate deeply into the transmembrane core. It is composed of two hydrophobic cores connected with a double bond, showing moderate similarity to resveratrol scaffold. All synthesized analogues were docked inside the binding cavity with average binding affinity (9\u201311 Kcal/mol) (Figure 2A,B). The 4\u2032-methyl group of 4\u2032-MRESV is oriented similarly to the fluorophenyl\u2013pyridyl group of Vorapaxar, buried in a hydrophobic cavity (Figure 2C). The 2 hydroxyl groups are oriented next to the extracellular part of PAR1, forming hydrogen bonds with H255 and S344 (Figure 2C). 3-MRESV is oriented with the A phenyl group in the hydrophobic pocket. The 5 OH group forms hydrogen bonds with Y187 and the backbone of G233, while the 4\u2032OH group forms hydrogen bond with H336 (Figure 2D). Moreover, 3,4\u2032DMRESV is oriented deeper to the binding cavity because of the second O-Me group, which is placed next to Y353 and A349, while the phenolic OH group forms hydrogen bonds with H336 and Y337 (Figure 2E). 3,5-DMRESV and TMRESV are placed inside the binding cavity with the 3,5 dimethyl groups facing the extracellular aqueous environment, decreasing the overall binding affinity. In the case of 3,5-DMRESV, the OH group is placed inside the hydrophobic cavity, and although it is forming hydrogen bonds with Y187 and the backbone of G233, it is unfavorable to pass through such a hydrophobic channel and finally reach those residues. Resveratrol shows the lowest binding energy and has the 4\u2032OH group placed inside the hydrophobic cavity which is unfavorable as was explained earlier.

            "text": "Resveratrol is a natural molecule that has attracted much scientific interest in recent decades [2]. Several biological activities have been attributed to resveratrol, including anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer effects. However, its low availability is a primary concern about its in vivo activity. In this study, methoxy derivatives of resveratrol were synthesized to increase its hydrophobicity and were found to have similar, worse, or better anti-platelet activity than the initial molecule depending o the position of the substitution. The 4\u2032 methoxy and 3 methoxy derivatives efficiently inhibit TRAP-induced platelet aggregation, especially in two orders and one order of magnitude, r spectively, more potently than the initial compou d. Platelets are key cells in many physio-pathological mechanisms [14]. Several antagonists, such as thrombin, collagen, ADP, PAF, serotonin, epinephrine, and thromboxane A2 (TXA2), induce platelet activation and aggregation. Many reports indicate that resveratrol inhibits thrombin, collagen, PAF or ADP-induced platelet adhesion or aggregation [18,26]. In addition, resveratrol inhibited thromboxane B2-induced platelet aggregation by inhibiting protein kinase C activity [18]. The inhibitory capacity of resveratrol ranges between tens and hundreds of \u00b5M depending on the use of PRP or washed platelet preparations, the agonist used, and the platelets\u2019 origin (human or rabbit). It should be noted that a lower concentration is needed when washed platelets are used to determine the anti-platelet effect. In the present study, human PRP was used instead of washed platelets because we believe that its matrix is more representative of the cells\u2019 in vivo environment. The IC50 value of resveratrol against PAF and TRAP was similar, whereas against ADP, it was significantly higher, indicating a greater capacity of resveratrol to interfere with PAF and TRAP agonists instead of ADP. Methylation has been shown to significantly affect platelet aggregation, depending on the number of methoxy groups and the specific methylated ring or position. Furthermore, the influence of methylation on platelet aggregation varies depending on the agonist used to induce it. ADP was the first low-molecular-weight compound identified as a platelet agonist [31] and stimulates primary platelet aggregation. Released by the storage granules, ADP is responsible for the secondary wave of aggregation and it is also involved in platelet stimulation by other agonists [32]. ADP-induced platelet aggregation is mediated by the activation of platelet P2Y1 and P2Y12 receptors [33]. However, resveratrol\u2019s methylation did not improve the ability to inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation. In fact, when\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5547 8 of 16\nthe substitution was carried out in the A ring, either in one or both hydroxyl groups, the anti-platelet activity of the initial compound worsened. In addition, the methylation in both the 3- and 5-hydroxy groups, in ring A has a lower impact on the second wave of platelet aggregation, as the IC50 value calculated based on AUC, instead of amplitude, was not significantly different from that of the initial compound. On the other hand, isorhapontigenin (3,4\u2032,5-trihydroxy-3\u2032-methoxystilbene), another derivative of resveratrol with an extra methylated hydroxyl group, has been reported to inhibit ADP-induced platelet aggregation more efficiently, which was also supported by molecular interactions of isorhapontigenin and resveratrol with P2Y12 receptor as predicted by in silico studies [34]. PAF, also known as acetyl-glyceryl-ether-phosphorylcholine, is an ether phospholipid that functions as a potent inducer of inflammation and platelet aggregation [12]. PAF exerts its effects through its specific receptor, PAFR, which is a G-protein coupled receptor with seven transmembrane domains. In our previous report, we demonstrated that acetylated derivatives inhibit PAF-induced platelet aggregation [26]. Specifically, mono- and triacetylation of resveratrol showed similar anti-platelet activity to resveratrol itself, while di-acetylation resulted in improved anti-platelet activity, indicating that the presence of two acetyl groups, but not three, is necessary for enhancing inhibitory activity. In the present study, methylation of resveratrol did not enhance its anti-platelet activity. Methylation of one ring (either A or B) did not show significant differences compared to the original compound. However, when methylation was performed on both rings (3,4\u2032-DMRESV and TMRESV), resveratrol\u2019s ability to inhibit PAF-induced aggregation was reduced. These findings suggest that the specific group used for substitution (acetoxy or methoxy) in resveratrol is more crucial than the increase in lipophilicity achieved by both substitutions. Thrombin, a serine protease, is another enzyme that induces platelet aggregation and triggers the release of active substances, including ADP. This process requires the presence of calcium ions. Thrombin elicits signaling, partly through G-protein\u2013linked protease-activated receptors (PARs), with human platelets expressing PAR1 and PAR4 [35]. PAR1 is considered to be the high-affinity thrombin receptor responsible for the initial platelet response, while PAR4 requires higher thrombin concentrations and participates in the late-phase response [36]. Consequently, PAR1 has attracted scientific interest as a novel anti-platelet target, but only one PAR1 antagonist, vorapaxar, is currently approved for clinical use [37]. In the present study, instead of thrombin, TRAP was used as agonist, a synthetic peptide that corresponds to the new N-terminal amino acid sequence of the \u201ctethered ligand\u201d generated after thrombin hydrolysis of the PAR1. The results revealed that, in some cases, methylation of resveratrol resulted in favorable alterations of its antiplatelet action. Specifically, dimethylation in the A ring (3,5-DMRESV, TMRESV) revealed compounds with similar or no anti-platelet activity against TRAP compared to resveratrol. In contrast, methyl substitution in the 3- or 4\u2019-hydroxyl groups, alone or in combination, resulted in compounds with significantly enhanced anti-platelet activity. The dimethyl derivative (3,4\u2032-DMRESV), the monomethyl derivative in the A ring (3-MRESV), and the monomethylated derivative in the B ring (4\u2032-MRESV) exhibited IC50 values almost half, 3.5 times, and 25 times lower than resveratrol, respectively. To our knowledge, no similar data exists to compare our results. However, a recent study reported that the 3,5,2\u2032,4\u2032- tetramethoxystilbene selectively inhibits PAR4-mediated human platelet aggregation, ATP secretion, integrin \u03b1IIb\u03b23 activation, and signaling pathways [27]. The activation of platelets by all tested agonists involves the activation of phopholipase C, which hydrolyzes the membrane-associated phosphatidylinositol 4,5 bisphosphate and produces the second messenger inositol 1,4,5-irisphosphate (IP3), contributing to Ca2+ mobilization from internal stores [35]. Additionally, the production of membrane-associated diacylglycerol activates protein kinase C, which participates in the phosphorylation of specific substrates [35]. While the anti-platelet mechanisms of methoxy derivatives cannot be identified based on the design of this study, their distinct actions against different agonists suggest interference in specific pathways related to each agonist. In silico studies were conducted to further investigate the binding of resveratrol methoxy derivatives with\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5547 9 of 16\nPAR1, supporting the biological experiments and revealing that 4\u2032-MRESV exhibits greater binding affinity toward the PAR1 receptor than resveratrol. Among the new compounds, 3MRESV appears to be worth investigating in prostate cancer cells, along with 3,5-DMRESV and 3,4\u2032-DMRESV, which have IC50 values ranging from 20.3\u201343 \u00b5M. Furthermore, 3,4\u2032-DMRESV and TMRESV have demonstrated greater activity against colon cancer cells, with IC50 values ranging from 48.6\u201354.8 \u00b5M. These compounds could be considered for further optimization. Previous studies by Grau et al., have shown that the methoxy derivative of resveratrol (E)-[1-(3,4,5-Trimethoxyphenyl)2-(2,4-dimethoxyphenyl)]ethene showed the strongest cytotoxicity against colon carcinoma (HT-29) and pancreatic carcinoma (MIA PaCa-2) cells lines with IC50 values of 12 \u00b1 3 and 28 \u00b1 4 \u00b5M, respectively, being six and five times more active than resveratrol in the respective cell lines, whereas (E)-1,3-Dimethoxy-5-(4-methoxystyryl)benzene also showed significant cytotoxicity 5- and 4-fold higher than resveratrol on HT-29 and MIA PaCa-2 cells [38]. In addition, Gosslau et al. demonstrated that the methoxy derivative of resveratrol 3,4,5,4\u2032-tetramethoxy-trans-stilbene, inhibited the growth of LNCaP prostate cancer cells, HT-29 colon cancer cells, and HepG2 hepatoma cells with the IC50 values in the range of 1\u20135 \u00b5M [39]. Furthermore, 3,4,4\u2032,5-tetramethoxy-stilbene demonstrated significant cytotoxic activity in clonogenic assays in the three cell lines investigated, i.e., 3 \u00b5M in the PC3 cells, 0.4 \u00b5M in the LNCaP, and DU-145 prostate cancer cell lines instead of 16 \u00b5M, 5 \u00b5M, and 10 \u00b5M of resveratrol, respectively [40]. Furthermore, the para- and ortho- resveratrol derivatives appeared as the most active RSV derivatives in inhibiting cell viability in a panel of pancreatic cancer cell lines with distinct genetic profiles compared to resveratrol [41]. Finally, the resveratrol analogues 4,4\u2032-(ethane-1,2-diyl) bis(2-methoxyphenol) and 4-(3- hydroxy-4-methoxyphenethyl)-2-methoxyphenol had very similar structures but exerted different cytotoxicity in non-small lung cancer cells. The IC50 values were 108.6 \u00b1 10.82 and more than 200 \u00b5M in the A549 cell line and 103.5 \u00b1 6.08 and more than 200 \u00b5M in H23 cells, respectively, while resveratrol itself exhibited more than 200 \u00b5M in both cell lines [42]. Finally, aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) has emerged as a promising agent for cancer prevention. However, there are suggestions that anti-platelet treatment may promote the development of solid tumors. Given the complex and bidirectional interaction between tumor cells and platelets in the blood and tumor microenvironment, further investigation is needed to understand the potential of anti-platelet agents in both cancer prevention and treatment [28,29]."

The most potent derivative observed was the 4\u2032-methoxy derivative, which exhibited approximately 2.5 orders of magnitude greater anti-platelet activity against TRAP-induced platelet aggregation, suggesting its potential as an anti-platelet agent. Using in silico docking simulations, we have discovered that all compounds exhibit a binding mode comparable to vorapaxar. Furthermore, our investigation has allowed us to elucidate the correlation between binding modes and the potency of the 4\u2032-methoxy derivative. It is also noteworthy that methoxy derivatives with similar activity to resveratrol could be potential anti-platelet agents as they may undergo in vivo bio-transformation, leading to improved bioavailability compared to resveratrol. These encouraging preliminary findings will provide valuable insights for our ongoing rational drug design campaign targeting human protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR1).\nAuthor Contributions: E.F. was responsible for the conceptualization, methodology and supervision of anti-platelet properties of compounds as well as data curation and writing of the manuscript.
