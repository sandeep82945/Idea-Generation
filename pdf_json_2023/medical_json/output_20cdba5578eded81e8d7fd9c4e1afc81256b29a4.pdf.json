            "text": "Page 2/7\nIntroduction Antioxidant-rich fruits and fruits by-products promote good health by lowering the risk of non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, cancer, atherosclerosis and neurodegenerative disorders [1, 2]. Such antioxidants protect against oxidative stress by inhibiting the formation of reactive oxygen species or neutralizing free radicals [3]. Fruits contain signi cant carbohydrates, dietary ber, protein, vitamins, amino acids and bioactive phytoconstituents [4]. In addition, micronutrients such as sodium, magnesium, zinc, iron, manganese and calcium are also enriched in fruits [5]. Banana is widely consumed worldwide, with global production of 114\u00a0million tonnes in 2017, among which India is the major producer with 29\u00a0million tonnes per year [6]. There are more than 80 Musa species belonging to the Musaceae family and over 1000 triploid or tetraploid cultivars obtained from the crossing of two diploid species, M. balbisiana (BB) and M. acuminata (AA) [7]. Musa balbisiana Colla is a wild species of banana that is underappreciated for its presence of seeds. It is distributed across tropical and subtropical areas from Southeast Asia to the Paci c. In India, M. balbisiana is widely distributed in western ghats, Andaman and Nicobar Island, and north-eastern states (Assam), where it has been incorporated with Assamese social culture since time immemorial [8].\nBanana has been used to remedy cough and cold, ulcers, diarrhea and wound healing [2]. The pseudostem and ower are consumed as vegetables and it is believed to treat diabetes, fever, seizures and leprosy. Other parts like roots, peel and seeds are used for alleviating digestive disorders [9]. M. balbisiana fruit pulp is rich in both macronutrients and micronutrients such as carbohydrates, starch, protein, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, zinc and iron [10]. Different parts of M. balbisiana have been reported for medicinal bene ts with signi cant amounts of bioactive compounds such as gallic acid, epicatechin, rutin, chlorogenic acid, quercetin and apigenin [2, 11]. Polyphenols-rich ripe pulp of M. balbisiana has cardioprotective properties and ameliorates cardiac hypertrophy through antioxidant and anti-in ammatory activities [12]. Apiforol, a avanol compound isolated from the seeds of M. balbisiana, exhibited signi cant \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibitory potential and facilitated glucose uptake in the cells [13]. Various mixtures of fatty esters of phytol and n-alkanols, \u03b2-sitosterol, stigmasta-5,22E-dien-3\u03b2-ol, and epiafzelechin are reported from M. balbisiana seeds [14].\nApart from these, there are no detailed reports on the study of the nutritional and biological properties of seeds and phytoconstituents present in M. balbisiana seeds. Therefore, the present study investigates the bioactive compounds present in M. balbisiana seeds by GC-MS and their nutritional, antioxidant, anti-glycation, \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition potential. The correlation between phytochemical content and biological properties was also studied. In addition, the bioenergetic pro les are estimated by monitoring OCR and ECAR using XFe24 extracellular ux analyzer to understand the protective effect of M. balbisiana seeds against oxidative stress-related mitochondrial and cellular dysfunction.\nMaterials And Methods The materials and methods section are presented as supplementary online resource.\nResults And Discussions Proximate Analysis of Musa balbisiana Seed\nSeed constitutes about 10.4 % of the total weight of Musa balbisiana fruit. The moisture and ash contents are 9.02 \u00b1 0.05 % and 7.22 \u00b1 1.1 %, respectively. Carbohydrates were the major macronutrient present followed by protein (Table S1). The total carbohydrate content was\u00a027.0 \u00b1 1.09 g/100 g dry weight. Of these, reducing sugar and starch content was 19.6 \u00b1 0.28 g/100 g and 5.27 \u00b1 1.03 g/100 g, respectively. The total carbohydrate content was found to be lower than the unripe banana our (Musa acuminata) [4] but higher than the raw pulp of Musa balbisiana\u00a0[10]. These might be due to the differences in the moisture content of the samples, where the seed and unripe banana our have 9.02 % and 6.9 % moisture content, and the raw pulp has more than 70 % [4, 10]. Carbohydrates present in bananas are reported to consist of dietary ber and resistant starch that can reduce post-prandial glycemic index, and promote colonic fermentation followed by the production of SCFA [15]. The total protein\nPage 3/7\ncontent of the seed (3.09 \u00b1 0.97 g/100 g) was lower than unripe banana our [4]. As reported by\u00a0Solis-Badillo et al., the protein content of bananas decreased with the increase in the maturity of the fruit [16]. Micronutrients have an important role in promoting health despite its requirement in small quantities and a diet rich in certain micronutrients helps combat malnutrition [4]. Among the minerals present in M. balbisiana seed, Ca exhibits the highest concentration (17.87\u00a0\u00b1\u00a00.7 mg/100 g) followed by Mg (14.53 \u00b1 0.49\u00a0mg/100 g), Na (8.96 \u00b1 0.22\u00a0mg/100 g), and Fe (4.7 \u00b1 1.17\u00a0mg/100 g), respectively (Table S1). Ca, Na and Fe content was higher in M. balbisiana seed as compared to Berangan and Rasthali cultivars of Malaysian banana, however, Mg content was lower [17]. Cu (0.53\u00a0\u00b1 0.04\u00a0mg/100 g), Zn (0.58\u00a0\u00b1 0.08\u00a0mg/100 g), and Mn (0.25\u00a0\u00b1 0.06\u00a0mg/100 g) content of M. balbisiana seeds were like those reported from ripe M. balbisiana\u00a0pulp (0.06 \u00b1 0.01 mg/100 g, 0.53 \u00b1 0.03 mg/100 g and 0.21 \u00b1 0.02 mg/100 g respectively) [10].\u00a0\nAntioxidant Activity of M. balbisiana Seed\nOxidative stress occurs when the production of reactive oxygen species exceeds detoxi cation by the antioxidant defence system. Therefore, screening of antioxidant molecules that can scavenge or stop the production of ROS and subsequently decrease oxidative stress is essential. The antioxidant activity of M. balbisiana seed methanolic extract (ME) was measured using DPPH, ABTS, FRAP and phosphomolybdenum assay. Using a single method to determine the antioxidant capacity is ine cient since antioxidants act in different mechanism either by donating an electron or hydrogen [3]. In the DPPH assay, EAF showed the highest antioxidant activity with an IC50 value of 44.7 \u00b1 0.47 \u00b5g/ml followed by nBF (56.9 \u00b1 0.14 \u00b5g/ml), ME (80.6 \u00b1 0.15\u00a0\u00b5g/ml) and WF (183.4 \u00b1 0.6 \u00b5g/ml). However, EAF scavenged 3.7-fold lower than the standard ascorbic acid (IC50 11.8 \u00b1 0.14 \u00b5g/ml) as shown in Table 1. In ABTS assay, the standard ascorbic acid exhibited the highest antioxidant capacity (IC50-10.9 \u00b1 0.38 \u00b5g/ml), which are not signi cant from EAF (13.8 \u00b1 1.2 \u00b5g/ml). DPPH and ABTS radical scavenging activity of M. balbisiana seed was higher than previously reported from M. balbisiana\u00a0pulp, where the most active fraction of pulp scavenged 50 % free radicals at 47.4 \u00b1 2.4 \u00b5g/ml and 69.9 \u00b1 5.7 \u00b5g/ml for DPPH and ABTS assay, respectively [10]. A consistent result was observed in FRAP and phosphomolybdenum assay where EAF showed the highest ferric-reducing capacity (IC50- 73.6 \u00b1 0.28 \u00b5g/ml) and molybdenum reduction (IC50- 55.4 \u00b1 1.10\u00a0\u00b5g/ml)\u00a0followed by nBF, ME and WF. Limited data on the antioxidant potential of M. balbisiana\u00a0seeds evaluated by DPPH assay was available [18]. There are no previous studies regarding ABTS, FRAP, and phosphomolybdenum assay of M. balbisiana\u00a0seed.\u00a0\nTable 1 IC50 values of antioxidant, anti-glycation and enzyme inhibition activity of M. balbisiana seed extract and its fractions\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nDPPH ABTS FRAP Phosphomolybdenum\u00a0 BSAFructose BSAMethylglyoxal Argininemethylglyoxal *\u03b1amylase\u00a0 *\u03b1glucosidase \u00a0\nME 82.0 \u00b1 2.5d 40.5 \u00b1 1.2c\n136.6 \u00b1 1.3d 102.7 \u00b1 4.5d 191.2 \u00b1 1.5d\n858.9 \u00b1 2.1d 903.9 \u00b1 2.5d 12.4 \u00b1 0.03a\n28.2 \u00b1 1.0a\nEAF 44.8 \u00b1 1.3b 13.8 \u00b1 1.2a\n74.6 \u00b1 1.6b\n55.4 \u00b1 1.1b 110.2 \u00b1 0.2a\n373.7 \u00b1 3.1b 490.1 \u00b1 3.2b 210.5 \u00b1 1.1c\n83.9 \u00b1 0.8b\nnBF 58.1 \u00b1 4.2c 22.9 \u00b1 0.9b\n104.3 \u00b1 0.7c 90.5 \u00b1 3.0c 140.1 \u00b1 0.9c\n756.2 \u00b1 2.2c 804.1 \u00b1 1.9c 6.7 \u00b1 0.4a\n20.6 \u00b1 0.6a\nWF 183.4 \u00b1 0.6e 100.2 \u00b1 5.5d 274.9 \u00b1 4.0e 191.0 \u00b1 3.4e 296.6 \u00b1 0.43e\nNo Activity 1629.8 \u00b1 8.5e 29.8 \u00b1 0.8b\n93.3 \u00b1 0.8c\nAscorbic acid 11.8 \u00b1 0.1a 10.9 \u00b1 0.4a\n21.0 \u00b1 1.1a\n28.4 \u00b1 0.1a \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\nAminoguanidine \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 129.9 \u00b1 0.1b\n360.4 \u00b1 1.4a 291.0 \u00b1 4.0a \u00a0 \u00a0\nAcarbose \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 5.96 \u00b1 0.02a\n23.8 \u00b1 1.3a\n*Inhibition assay.

Here, we mimic the three stages (initial, middle and late) of glycation by BSA-Fructose, BSA-methylglyoxal and Arginine-methylglyoxal models, respectively. EAF exhibited antiglycation activity against all stages of glycation with IC50 values lower than crude extract and other fractions. In BSA-fructose assay, the ME, EAF, nBF and WF inhibited 50 % glycation at concentration of\u00a0191.2 \u00b1 1.5, 110.2 \u00b1 0.2, 140.1 \u00b1 0.9 and 296.6 \u00b1 0.43\u00a0\u00b5g/ml respectively as shown in Table 1. The highest inhibition was observed in case of EAF, which is signi cantly higher (p<0.001) than the standard, aminoguanidine. M. balbisiana seeds were previously reported for inhibition of protein glycation by glucose more effectively than ascorbic acid with IC50 value of 86.48 \u00b1 0.751 \u00b5g/ml [13]. Protection of fructose-mediated protein glycation is vital in preventing AGE-associated diseases, as fructose is ten times more reactive than glucose [20]. Fructose can be generated via a polyol pathway under high blood glucose level or through diet, which in turn glycate the proteins non-enzymatically to form AGE [19]. In the BSA-methylglyoxal model, EAF showed the highest inhibition (IC50-\u00a0373.7 \u00b1 3.1\u00a0\u00b5g/ml) among all samples followed by nBF, ME, and WF. Aminoguanidine (IC50-\u00a0360.4 \u00b1 1.4\u00a0\u00b5g/ml) was more effective in controlling the intermediate stage of glycation than EAF (p<0.05). According to Wang et al., arginine and lysine residues were prone to glycation by methylglyoxal that react with arginine to form an AGE called argpyrimidine, which accumulation in the lens causing in ammation and cataracts [20]. In the arginine-methylglyoxal assay, EAF inhibited 50% generation of uorescent AGEs at the concentration of 490.10 \u00b1 3.18 \u00b5g/ml (Table 1). The anti-glycation activity increased in the order WF<ME<nBF<EAF<AG. Furthermore, EAF lowered the initial stages of glycation more effectively than the standard drug (aminoguanidine). However, with the advancement in glycation, the effectiveness at lower concentrations decreases. Thus, EAF can be used as an early glycation inhibitor.\u00a0\n\u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase Inhibition Activity of M. balbisiana Seed\nInhibition of carbohydrate hydrolyzing enzymes is considered effective in controlling post-prandial hyperglycaemia [19]. M. balbisiana seed extract and its fractions have potent \u03b1-amylase inhibition activity. nBF had highest inhibition activity with IC50- 6.7 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b5g/ml, which is not signi cantly different from the therapeutic drug acarbose (IC50- 5.96 \u00b1 0.02 \u00b5g/ml) and crude methanol extract (IC50- 12.4 \u00b1 0.03 \u00b5g/ml) as shown in Table 1. Although EAF exhibited the highest antioxidant and antiglycation activity, it showed the least \u03b1-amylase inhibition potential (IC50- 210.5 \u00b1 1.1 \u00b5g/ml) as compared to other fractions. Furthermore, \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition potential of M. balbisiana seed was evaluated and nBF has the highest inhibition and lowest IC50 (20.6 \u00b1 0.6 \u00b5g/ml), which is lower than acarbose (IC50- 23.8 \u00b1 1.3 \u00b5g/ml) and ME (IC50- 28.2 \u00b1 1.0 \u00b5g/ml) (both p>0.05). The \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition by WF (IC50- 93.3 \u00b1 0.8 \u00b5g/ml) is higher than EAF (IC50- 83.9 \u00b1 0.8 \u00b5g/ml). Commercial drugs like acarbose have strong \u03b1-amylase inhibition property and less \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition resulting in the fermentation of undigested carbohydrates raising different side effects like atulence, bloating, diarrhoea and abdominal discomfort [19]. Therefore, drugs with strong \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition and low inhibition of \u03b1-amylase are more desirable and EAF have these criteria. \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase inhibition potential presented in this study was higher than those reported from ethanol, water, hexane and acetone extracts of the M. balbisiana seeds [13]. This might be due to the differences in the use of extracting solvents, where choosing solvents that can extract a high quantity of phytochemicals is one of the critical factors in obtaining samples with higher biological activity [21].\u00a0\nPhytochemical Content of\u00a0M. balbisana\u00a0Seed\nThe highest phenolic content was observed for the EAF (61.53 \u00b1 0.11 mg GAE/g) and nBF (61.25 \u00b1 0.21\u00a0mg GAE/g) followed by ME (59.5 \u00b1 0.28\u00a0mg GAE/g) and WF (56.4 \u00b1 0.71\u00a0mg GAE/g) as shown in Table S2. However,\u00a0TFC was signi cantly varied among the tested samples.\u00a0EAF has the highest TFC (6.00 \u00b1 0.04\u00a0mg QE/g) followed by nBF, ME and WF (p<0.001). TPC and TTC of M. balbisiana seed was higher than root, stem and in orescence part reported by Kalita et al., but lower than the pulp [10, 22]. In consistent with TPC and TFC, total tannin content was signi cantly high in EAF (59.43\u00a0\u00b1 0.55 mg CE/g, p<0.001). Tannins are particularly rich in fruits, nuts, vegetables and beverages such as tea, wine and cider. Even though tannins have been misunderstood as anti-nutrients that compromise proteins and mineral absorption, recent studies reported several biological properties including antioxidant, anti-microbial, and anti-in ammatory [23].\u00a0\nGas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) Analysis\nThe therapeutic properties of plants are due to numerous non-nutritive secondary metabolites produced to protect themselves. Therefore, identi cation of bioactive molecules having biomedical applications is important. GC-MS chromatogram of EAF displayed 76 compounds with matching spectra with NIST library (Fig. S1). To improve the accuracy of compound identi cation, compounds with a higher mass spectral similarity score (\u2264 90) with reference library are selected. As shown in Table S3, 14 compounds were identi ed from EAF that exhibited various phytochemical activities. The major phytoconstituents present in EAF were\u00a0hexadecanoic acid, methyl ester (12.89 %); 9-Octadecenoic acid, methyl ester, (E)- (4.93 %); methyl stearate (4.85 %); 13-docosenamide, (Z)- (4.56 %); 9,12-octadecadienoic acid (Z, Z)-, methyl ester (4.41 %); and \u03b3-sitosterol (3.39 %). nhexadecanoic acid,\u00a02,4-di-tert-butylphenol, hexadecanoic acid methyl ester, and 1-nonadecene\u00a0have been previously identi ed from Musa paradisiaca fruit pulp and reported for their antioxidant and antibacterial properties [24]. The major compound,\u00a0hexadecanoic acid methyl ester or methyl palmitate is a saturated fatty acid belonging to the class fatty acid methyl ester. It has been reported for its\u00a0antioxidant, hypocholesterolemic, hemolytic, anti-fungal,\u00a05-\u03b1 reductase inhibitor and anti-microbial activity\u00a0[25].\u00a0There are reports of plant phytosterol being more effective in lowering LDL cholesterol in patients who cannot tolerate standard drugs like statin [9, 11]. Thus, the biological activity of EAF might be due to the presence of these compounds.\nCorrelation Between Phytochemical Content and Biological Activity\nPage 5/7\nPearson's Correlation analysis is reported in the supplementary online resource along with Table S4.\nCell Viability Assay\nThe cell viability assay is reported in the supplementary online resource.\nEAF Improves FFA-induced Mitochondrial Dysfunction\nFree fatty acid (FFA) induces oxidative stress by increasing the generation of ROS along with hampering mitochondrial and cellular function [26]. Therefore, this study evaluated the effect of EAF on mitochondrial function and cellular bioenergetics under FFA-induced oxidative stress by directly measuring OCR in real-time on XFe extracellular ux analyzer (Fig. S1 a). Basal respiration of FFA-treated cells was signi cantly reduced (p<0.01) due to the oxidative stress induced by FFA (Fig. S1 b). Treatment with FFA signi cantly decreased MR (p<0.001), ATP production (p<0.001) and SRC, (p<0.01) (Fig. S1 c-e). MR showed the maximum rate of respiration cells could achieve by oxidizing substrates under physiological energy demand. SRC is the cell tness indicator and offers mitochondrial capacity to respond to an energetic request by producing more ATP [27]. The incapacity of the FFA-treated cells to respond to an energetic demand was restored after EAF pre-treatment. The lower concentration of EAF (25 \u03bcg/ml) was more effective in protecting against mitochondrial dysfunction by increasing ATP production, MR and SRC than the higher concentration, EAF 50 \u03bcg/ml and the therapeutic drug, metformin (60 \u00b5M). This is the rst study to report real-time OCR data of M. balbisiana seeds using an XFe extracellular ux analyser.\nEAF Improves FFA-induced Glycolysis Stress\nChanges in the glycolytic pathway or abnormal glycolysis impact mitochondrial functions and generate endogenous dicarbonyl compounds, which might lead to neurodegenerative diseases and aging [28]. Cells can switch between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation depending on their energy demand. The glycolysis stress test pro le is shown in Fig. S2 a. FFA-treated cells were not able to undergo glycolysis effectively even after injecting saturating amount of glucose (Fig. S2 b). FFA treatment induced oxidative stress as well as hampered cell ability to shift the energy production from mitochondrial respiration to glycolysis after oligomycin treatment. This treatment affected both glycolytic capacity and reserve (p<0.001) (Fig. S2 c-d). However, a signi cant increase in glycolysis and glycolytic capacity was observed in EAF-treated cells (p<0.01). Furthermore, EAF (25 \u00b5g/ml) treatment improved the glycolytic function of cells by increasing the GR (p<0.05). Non-glycolysis acidi cation was also measured (Fig. S2 e). A signi cant increase in glycolysis-induced cell proliferation in human adipose stem cells was reported to acts as an anti-aging effect [29]. EAF improved the overall metabolic dysfunction by improving the mitochondrial and glycolytic function. This is the rst study to report real-time ECAR data using an XFe extracellular ux analyser to support the e cacy of the bioactive fraction of M. balbisiana seeds in regulating stressmediated glycolysis.\nConclusion Musa balbisiana seeds are nutrient-rich part of the fruit containing plenty amount of carbohydrates, protein and mineral content. M. balbisiana has signi cant antioxidant, anti-glycation and anti-hyperglycemic effects via inhibiting \u03b1-amylase and \u03b1-glucosidase enzymes. GC-MS analysis of M. balbisiana seeds identi ed several bioactive compounds having pharmacological properties including methyl palmitate, methyl linoleate and \u03b3sitosterol. There is a strong correlation between phenolic and tannin content with biological activities suggesting major contribution of phenolic compounds to the antioxidant and anti-glycation activities. In addition, M. balbisiana improves the mitochondrial bioenergetics and glycolytic function of oxidative stress-induced cells by improving the OCR and ECAR. In this respect, M. balbisiana seeds could be recommended as dietary supplements and nutraceuticals to improve health and provide protection against chronic diseases. However, further research is required to characterize phenolic compounds present to understand the mechanism of action.\nAbbreviations ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis (3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid),\u00a0DPPH\u00a0(1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl), ECAR Extracellular acidi cation rate,\u00a0FRAP Ferric reducing antioxidant power assay, NIST National Institute of Standards and Technology, OCR Oxygen consumption rate, TPC\u00a0Total phenolic content, TFC\u00a0Total avonoid content,\u00a0TTC\u00a0Total tannin content.\u00a0\nDeclarations Author Contributions\nNonibala Gurumayum and Rajlakshmi Devi - conceptualization & design; Nonibala Gurumayum - Methodology, investigation, analysis & writing original draft; Partha Pratim Sarma and Puspanjali Khound - investigation; Uttam Kumar Jana and Rajlakshmi Devi - writing (review & editing); Rajlakshmi Devi - supervision.\nFunding\nPage 6/7\nNonibala Gurumayum acknowledges the University Grant Commission (UGC), Government of India, for manpower support in the form of a Junior Research Fellowship.
