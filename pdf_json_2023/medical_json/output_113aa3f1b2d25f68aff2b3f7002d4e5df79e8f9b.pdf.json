For the central nervous system, although xenotransplantation remains state-of-the-art, such models are technically challenging, limited in throughput, and expensive. Moreover, the environmental signals present do not perfectly cross-react with human cells. This paper presents an inexpensive, accessible, and high-throughput-compatible model for the transplantation and tracking of human neural cells into human cerebral organoids. These organoids can be easily generated from human induced pluripotent stem cells using commercial kits and contain the key cell types of the cerebrum.\nWe first demonstrate this transplant protocol with the injection of EGFP-labeled human iPSC-derived neural progenitor cells (NPCs) into these organoids. We next discuss considerations for tracking the growth of these cells in the organoid by livecell fluorescence microscopy and demonstrate the tracking of transplanted EGFPlabeled NPCs in an organoid over a 4 month period. Finally, we present a protocol for the sectioning, cyclic immunofluorescent staining, and imaging of the transplanted cells in their local context. The organoid transplantation model presented here allows the long-term (at least 4 months) tracking of transplanted human cells directly in a human microenvironment with an inexpensive and simple-to-perform protocol. It, thus, represents a useful model both for neural cell therapies (transplants) and, likely, for modeling central nervous system (CNS) tumors in a more microenvironmentally accurate manner."

One major limitation in the advancement of such strategies, however, is the relative paucity of available preclinical models to determine the expected transplantation outcomes. The most used models currently are in vitro culture methods to determine cell potential and xenotransplantation into mice. While cell culture methods can assess differentiation and self-renewal potential9 , these are performed under optimal growth conditions that do not mimic the microenvironment the cells would encounter in a transplant context. Moreover, the way in which the cells are grown can influence their behavior10 .\nMouse brains contain all the cells of the microenvironment and are, thus, extremely powerful model systems for transplantation11 . There are, however, important differences between the mouse and human cortex12,13 , and not all growth factors cross-react between species. Primate models are a closer alternative that better mimic the human system and have also yielded important preclinical results14 . Even these more closely related relatives, however, retain important differences in their cellular makeup15 . While both of these model systems provide valuable insights into cell behavior during transplant and incorporate the surgical elements of an eventual therapy, they remain imperfect. They are also costly and technically challenging (i.e., one must perform brain surgery on the animals), thus limiting the possible throughput. Moreover, there are a plethora of ethical issues associated with transplanting human brain cells into animals16 . Brain slice cultures allow one brain to be cut and used for multiple treatments, thus removing some of the limitations of animal transplants; however, these have limited lifespans (weeks), are still animal-derived, and (being a thin\nslice) do not have sufficient volume/surface integrity to mimic the injection of cells17 . Thus, there remains an important gap between strictly cell culture/potential models and in vivo transplantation.\nCerebral organoids are an in vitro model containing the main neural cell types present in the brain and can be generated in high numbers from human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs)18,19 . Such organoids thus provide a cellular context, which could allow the assessment of the functional capacity of a test cell of interest in the transplant setting. Indeed, a recent study demonstrated that neural progenitor cells (NPCs) transplanted into human cerebral organoids survive, proliferate, and differentiate similarly to NPCs transplanted into the brain of a non-obese diabetic severe combined immunodeficient gamma (NSG) mouse20 . Cerebral organoids thus represent a cruelty-free, long-lived (>6 months), cost-effective system that captures the cell types of the human brain. As such, they could represent an ideal transplant recipient for the early-stage testing of the regenerative capacity of neural cells.\nThis paper presents a protocol for the transplantation and subsequent tracking of labeled human NPCs into human cerebral organoids (Figure 1). This begins with the injection of GFP-labeled NPCs into mature (2-4 months old) cerebral organoids18 . The transplanted cells are then followed by livecell fluorescence microscopy over a 4 month period. During this time, we show both the persistence of cells at the injection site but also migration to distal regions of the organoid. At the endpoint, we demonstrate the antigen retrieval, staining, and imaging of histological sections derived from these organoids, including a protocol for the quenching of existing AlexaFluor-based dyes to allow additional staining and imaging rounds, based on previous work21 . This\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 JoVE Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License\njove.com July 2023 \u2022 197 \u2022 e64770 \u2022 Page 3 of 21\nprotocol could, thus, be useful in the measurement of the differentiation capacity of cells in a transplant setting, graft durability, cell expansion in situ, and cell migration from the site of the transplant. We anticipate that this will be useful both for regenerative medicine/cell therapy applications, as well as tumor modeling by engrafting tumor cells into relevant regionspecific organoids."

Fluorophore labeling of cells by lentiviral transduction\n1. Thaw an aliquot of the solubilized basement membrane\nmatrix of choice on ice.\n2. While the aliquot is thawing, add sterile water to fill in the\ngaps between the wells in a 24-well plate, along with all the outer wells. NOTE: This leaves eight wells open in the middle for use and ensures that the cells remain in high humidity, thus minimizing evaporation-induced variability.\n3. Dilute the solubilized basement membrane matrix 1:100\nin ice-cold DMEM/F12 medium (a final concentration of 0.089 mg/mL was obtained with the lot used here).\n4. Add 300 \u00b5L of the diluted solubilized basement\nmembrane matrix to one of the middle (open) wells of the prepared 24-well plate per infection to be performed. Be sure to evenly cover the entire bottom of the well, and add more, if needed, to ensure an even coating.\n5. Incubate the plate for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C to allow a\nlayer to solidify along the well bottom. Verify at the end of this incubation that the liquid is still fully covering\nthe well bottom and has not evaporated in the center. Evaporation is a sign that the humidity is too low; if this happens, repeat the coating. NOTE: The plates can be coated the evening before and left in diluted solubilized basement membrane matrix without evident ill effects; however, the risk of evaporation is greatly increased, so they must be carefully inspected before use.\n6. Remove the medium from one well of confluent iPSC-\nderived NPCs growing in a well plate. NOTE: For this paper, iPSC-derived neural progenitors produced using a commercial kit as per the manufacturer's instructions between passage 3 and passage 10 were used.\n7. Gently add 1 mL of PBS to the side of the well, and rock\nthe plate to ensure even washing.\n8. Remove the PBS, and replace with 300 \u00b5L of the\nproteolytic-collagenolytic enzyme mix, again rocking the plate to ensure to fully coat the well bottom. Incubate for 5 min at 37 \u00b0C. Verify that the cells are detaching from the plate surface by light microscopy.\n9. With a P1,000 pipette, add 700 \u00b5L of DMEM/F12, and\ndetach the cells by spraying this mixture across all the surfaces of the bottom of the plate. Pipette up and down to ensure the cell aggregates are broken up into a uniform single-cell suspension. Take up the cells, and add to 9 mL of DMEM/F12 medium in a conical 15 mL tube.\n10. Centrifuge at 300 \u00d7 g for 5 min.\n11. During this time, prepare enough medium supplemented\nwith 10 \u00b5M Y-27632 for 500 \u00b5L per well to be plated, plus 1 mL for resuspension. NOTE: Y-27632 is necessary to ensure high survival of the NPCs after passage as single cells.\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 JoVE Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License\njove.com July 2023 \u2022 197 \u2022 e64770 \u2022 Page 4 of 21\n12. Remove the supernatant, and resuspend the cells in\n1 mL of Y-27632-supplemented medium, pipetting up and down gently several times to break up the cell aggregates.\n13. Take out a few microliters of cells, and dilute them (1:5\nto 1:10) in trypan blue.\n14. Count the viable (trypan blue-negative) cells on a\nhemocytometer. Adjust the trypan blue dilution to get at least 50 viable cells per quadrant of the hemocytometer to ensure the counts are accurate. Calculate the volume of cell suspension needed for 100,000 cells to be present in each well.\n15. Mix the cells gently up and down by pipetting, and take\nup the calculated volume (for 100,000 cells per well). Add this to the Y-27632-supplemented medium (from step 1.11) such that the final volume is 500 \u00b5L per well to be plated.\n16. Remove the diluted solubilized basement membrane\nmatrix from the previously coated wells (assuming the 30 min or longer incubation has been completed).\n17. Mix the cells gently by pipetting, and add 500 \u00b5L of the\ncell suspension to each well.\n18. To evenly distribute the cells, move the plate in a large\n\"+\" sign motion with gentle linear sweeps (forwardbackward, stop, back-forth) immediately prior to placing into a cell culture incubator.\n19. Incubate overnight (16-24 h) at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2.\n20. Remove the medium, and add the titrated lentivirus.\nIf single integration events are required, aim for a multiplicity of infection of 0.3 infectious units per cell (ideally titrated on the cells of interest), and top up to 500 \u00b5L in medium (without Y-27632).\nNOTE: The lentivirus of interest can be purchased pretitrated or produced in-house as done previously22 . Here, an in-house-produced GFP lentivirus with puromycin resistance was used to generate and select the NPCs expressing EGFP. If the lentivirus has not been titrated on the cells of interest and the copy number is critical, it is recommended that several volumes be added to a couple of wells and that the well with ~30% EGFP+ cells 48-72 h be used later. If the copy number is not critical, excess virus can be added with the caveat that insertional mutagenesis may result in anomalous behavior in some clones.CAUTION: Lentiviral vectors are a level 2-3 biological hazard (depending on their contents). Follow local biosafety regulations for handling the lentivirus, the decontamination of surfaces and plasticware, and liquid waste.\n21. Return the cells to the incubator, and incubate them for\n24 h at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2.\n22. Remove the cells from the incubator, and remove the\nsupernatant. CAUTION: As the supernatant from the cells still contains lentiviral particles at this point, continue to follow local biosafety regulations for its handling and disposal.\n23. Rinse the cells with 2 x 500 \u00b5L of PBS by gently adding\nPBS to the wall of the well; then, remove from the well corner to wash away any remaining lentivirus. CAUTION: As the supernatant from the cells still contains lentiviral particles at this point, continue to follow local biosafety regulations for its handling and disposal.\n24. Change to 500 \u00b5L of fresh medium (without Y-27632),\nand continue to grow at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 overnight.\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 JoVE Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License\njove.com July 2023 \u2022 197 \u2022 e64770 \u2022 Page 5 of 21\n25. Use live-cell fluorescence microscopy to verify the\nproportion of cells that express EGFP and select the well with which to proceed.\n26. If the lentiviral vector of choice contains a selection\ncassette (antibiotic resistance gene such as puromycin resistance), add the selection agent (here, 1 \u00b5g/mL puromycin) to the medium at a previously validated dose that kills sensitive but not resistant cells. Otherwise, use fluorescence-activated cell sorting to isolate the EGFP+ cells at the time of the first split.\n27. From now onward, maintain the cells with daily\nmonitoring for confluency, and perform complete medium changes daily.\n28. When confluency is reached, prepare one or more\nwells of a fresh 6-well coated plate (with 1 mL of diluted solubilized basement membrane matrix; see steps 1.3-1.5), and harvest the cells as described in steps 1.6-1.15. NOTE: If no selection agent is included, sort the cells by flow cytometry at this stage. Ensure that the cells are sorted with a sufficiently wide nozzle and low pressure to minimize stress, as well as that 10 \u00b5M Y-27632 is included at every step in the sorting process.\n29. Plate the cells to a final density of 200,000 cells/cm2 .\n30. Maintain the daily monitoring and complete medium\nchanges daily. NOTE: When the cells again reach confluency, they are now ready for use. Alternatively, a stock can now be frozen down for future use as follows.\n31. Split, harvest, and count the cells as described in steps\n1.6-1.15.\n32. Pre-label a set of cryovials with the relevant information\n(e.g., passage, EGFP%, line).\n33. Resuspend at 400,000 cells/mL in medium + 10%\nDMSO. NOTE: DMSO is toxic to cells when not frozen, so minimize the time spent at room temperature in the presence of DMSO.\n34. Add 1 mL (400,000 cells) of the mixture from step\n1.33 per cryovial, and place in a cell-freezing container.\n35. Transfer the container to a \u221280 \u00b0C freezer overnight.\n36. The following day, transfer the cells into liquid nitrogen\nfor long-term storage.\n2. Labeled cell injection into the brain organoid\nNOTE: For this paper, cerebral organoids were produced using a commercial kit as per the manufacturer's instructions. This can be replaced with the cerebral organoid of interest. The materials used in this part of the protocol must be prechilled to avoid the gelling of the solubilized basement membrane matrix at above 4 \u00b0C.\n1. Place the insulin syringe(s), tips, and tubes that are going\nto be in contact with the solubilized basement membrane matrix at \u221220 \u00b0C to let them cool.\n2. Thaw a suitable-size aliquot of solubilized basement\nmembrane matrix on ice depending on the number of injections that are going to be performed (~2 \u00b5L/ injection). This takes approximately 30 min.\n3. While the aliquot is thawing, split, harvest, and count the\ncells as described in steps 1.6-1.15.\n4. Calculate the volumes needed per injection. If doing\nmultiple injections, place the total volume of cells in a 1.5 mL tube, and add up to 1 mL of DMEM/F12.\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 JoVE Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License\njove.com July 2023 \u2022 197 \u2022 e64770 \u2022 Page 6 of 21\nNOTE: A volume that allows for a few extra injections should be used to account for losses/pipetting errors.\n5. Place the cells into ice while the next steps are being\nprepared.\n6. After thawing, dilute the solubilized basement membrane\nmatrix to a final concentration of 3 mg/mL in ice-cold DMEM/F12.\n7. Take the single-cell suspension from the ice, and spin it\ndown at 300 \u00d7 g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C. NOTE: If a refrigerated centrifuge is not available, spinning at room temperature generally appears to be tolerated.\n8. Gently remove the medium completely without disturbing\nthe cell pellet. Resuspend the cell pellet by gentle pipetting in the diluted solubilized basement membrane matrix (3 mg/mL) to obtain a final volume of 2 \u00b5L per injection to be performed, and immediately place it back on ice until use. NOTE: The resuspension of the cells needs to be performed slowly and with prechilled tips to avoid the formation of bubbles and gelling.\n9. Transfer the prechilled syringe(s) from the \u221220 \u00b0C freezer\ninto an ice bucket. Keep them there until use.\n10. Remove the plate with the brain organoids from the\nincubator. Use a wide-bore tip to transfer the organoid to be injected into a 35 mm dish. Remove all the medium possible without damaging the organoid to stabilize it and facilitate the injection. NOTE: It is important to use wide-bore tips to avoid destroying the organoid. If they are not available, cut the end of a regular P1,000 tip with sterile scissors.\n11. Place the 35 mm dish containing the organoid under a\ndissecting microscope to help guide and facilitate the injection. NOTE: If a dissecting microscope is not available in a sterile area, it is possible to perform the injection without one, albeit with somewhat reduced control. Another alternative is the use of a magnification loop or glasses.\n12. Once the organoid(s) are ready to be injected, gently\nresuspend the cells with a chilled P20 pipette tip, and move 2 \u00b5L (containing the desired number of cells to be injected) onto a prechilled sterile glass slide. NOTE: For multiple injections, additional 2 \u00b5L volumes can be added across the glass slide. Keep it on ice, and take care to avoid evaporation.\n13. Take a prechilled insulin syringe from the ice, and slowly\ndraw up the 2 \u00b5L of cell suspension with the bevel of the needle facing down to allow all the cells/medium to be taken up. NOTE: Make sure to go extremely slowly to avoid drawing in any air.\n14. Open the lid of the dish containing the organoid, and\nfocus the microscope on it. Hold the dish with one hand. Place the bevel of the needle up, and with the other hand, inject the cells slowly into the organoid surface. NOTE: It is important to inject slowly to avoid damaging the tissue.\n15. After the injection, place the lid back into the dish, and let\nthe injected organoid sit for 1-2 min. NOTE: This allows the diluted solubilized basement membrane matrix to gel, holding the cells in place. If the medium is added too early, it can wash away the cells sitting at the surface.\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 JoVE Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License\njove.com July 2023 \u2022 197 \u2022 e64770 \u2022 Page 7 of 21\n16. Gently add 500 \u00b5L of the organoid medium, and transfer\nthe organoid with a wide-bore tip into a well of a 24- well plate. Incubate the organoid at 37 \u00b0C and 5% CO2 overnight. Perform complete medium changes every second day. NOTE: It is important to include a negative control organoid (mock injected), which will be used for imaging adjustments. To do this, inject an organoid as previously described with diluted solubilized basement membrane matrix (3 mg/mL) to obtain a final volume of 2 \u00b5L without cells.\n3. Graft tracking by live-cell fluorescence imaging\nNOTE: Use a fluorescence microscope that can excite the fluorophore of interest and has the filter set needed to detect its fluorescence. As mentioned before, the NPCs used here were EGFP+ , with an excitation peak of 488 nm and an emission peak of ~510 nm.\n1. Load a negative control organoid (non-injected or mock\ninjected), and set the illumination intensity and exposure time such that autofluorescence is minimal. For the instrument used here, the illumination intensity was set between 1 and 2 and the exposure time between 80 ms and 100 ms. NOTE: As many excitation wavelengths (particularly lower wavelengths) can be toxic to cells, it is recommended to keep the intensity low and to avoid looking for too long to prevent damage to the organoid.\n2. Load the positive control organoid, and raise the\nexposure time if necessary to ensure that labeled cells are clearly visible. Reposition the organoid with a widebore pipette tip to find the injection site (EGFP+ region).\n3. Remove the medium completely from the negative\ncontrol organoid. Load the negative control organoid, and image it with the selected settings (for the instrument used here, the illumination intensity was set between 1 and 2 and the exposure time between 80 ms and 100 ms). When the imaging is complete, immediately add fresh medium to prevent the organoid from drying out. NOTE: Medium removal is critical for obtaining a good image as it fixes the height and orientation of the organoids, which are otherwise floating and constantly moving, precluding high-quality imaging.\n4. Repeat the medium removal/imaging with each of the\ntest organoids.\n5. Return the organoids to normal incubation/medium\nchanges (as in step 2.16), and repeat the imaging at desired intervals. Here, the organoids were imaged at week 1, week 9, and week 16 post injection to follow and test the survival, proliferation, differentiation, and migration of the injected EGFP+ NPCs.\n4. Histology and immunofluorescence\n1. At the endpoint, transfer the organoid to a histology\ncassette labeled with the ID of the organoid and other necessary identifiers.\n2. Fill the cassette with 10% formalin, and close it. Keep it\nat room temperature for 24 h.\n3. Transfer the closed cassette with the organoid to a tissue\nprocess, and set the following protocol: ethanol 70% 10 min, ethanol 80% 20 min, ethanol 95% 30 min, ethanol 100% 30 min, ethanol 100% 40 min, ethanol 100% 50 min, toluene 30 min, toluene 40 min, toluene 50 min, paraffin 25 min at 59 \u00b0C, paraffin 35 min at 59 \u00b0C, paraffin 40 min at 59 \u00b0C, paraffin 50 min at 59 \u00b0C.\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 JoVE Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License\njove.com July 2023 \u2022 197 \u2022 e64770 \u2022 Page 8 of 21\nNOTE: The above steps are done under a vacuum at room temperature unless otherwise specified. This protocol replaces the water with gradients of alcohol up to 100%. The intermediate step with toluene is a transition between the alcohol and paraffin, as both are soluble in it. CAUTION: Toluene and paraffin are considered hazardous materials as they can be highly flammable liquids and can cause damage by inhalation or contact with the skin or eyes. Make sure to store them tightly closed in a secure space. Wear proper personal protective equipment when handling them. Dispose of waste according to local chemical hazard regulations.\n4. Transfer the closed cassette with the organoid into a\nparaffin bath in the embedding station.\n5. Take the cassette from the bath, open it, and transfer the\norganoid into a steel base mold. Place the mold under the paraffin dispenser, and cover it completely with paraffin.\n6. Place the empty cassette on the top of the steel base\nmold. Here, add more paraffin on top of the cassette.\n7. Transfer the steel base mold with the cassette on top\ninto ice, and let it cool for 5 min. Remove the steel mold, and keep the cassette with the organoid embedded in a paraffin block.\n8. Transfer the cassette into a microtome to cut sections.\nCut sections as desired. NOTE: Here, sections of 15 \u00b5m thickness were made throughout the organoid.\n9. Drop each section onto the surface of a water bath set at\n45 \u00b0C, and pick it up on a glass microscope slide.\n10. Let the slides dry in an incubator at 42 \u00b0C overnight.\nNOTE: The slides can now be stored at room temperature until the time of staining.\n11. Place the slide in a Coplin slide staining jar filled with\ntoluene for 2 min. Repeat this step once more. CAUTION: Toluene is considered a hazardous material as it can be a highly flammable liquid and can cause damage by inhalation or contact with the skin or eyes. Make sure to store it tightly closed in a secure space. Wear proper personal protective equipment when handling it. Dispose of waste according to local chemical hazard regulations.\n12. Transfer to a glass Coplin slide staining jar filled with\nEtOH 100% for 2 min. Repeat this step once more.\n13. Transfer to a glass Coplin slide staining jar filled with\ndistilled water for 2 min. Repeat this step once more.\n14. For antigen retrieval, prepare citrate buffer (10 mM citric\nacid, 0.05% Tween 20, pH 6.0). NOTE: Citrate buffer can be stored at room temperature for up to 3 months or at 4 \u00b0C for longer storage.\n15. Set a water bath between 95 \u00b0C and 100 \u00b0C.\nCAUTION: This water bath can cause burns if one is not careful. Take all necessary precautions to avoid direct contact with the bath or its components.\n16. In the water bath, float a plastic container that can fit\nthe slides inside. Ensure the plastic does not touch the bottom of the bath (assuming it is a bottom-heating bath) to avoid melting. Pour the citrate buffer inside the plastic container, and let it reach 95-100 \u00b0C.\n17. Once the buffer reaches the desired temperature, place\nthe slides inside the buffer, and loosely cover the container with a lid. Leave the slides inside the container in the water bath for 30-40 min.\n18. Remove the plastic container from the water bath, and\nlet it cool at room temperature for 20 min more.\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 JoVE Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License\njove.com July 2023 \u2022 197 \u2022 e64770 \u2022 Page 9 of 21\n19. Wash the slides for 3 x 2 min with PBS. Remove the\nPBS with a paper tissue without touching the sample or overdrying it.\n20. Prepare the permeabilization buffer (90 mL of PBS +\n0.1% Tween-20), and fill a glass slide staining jar with it. Immerse the slides in the permeabilization buffer, and incubate for 10 min.\n21. Wash the slides for 3 x 2 min with PBS.\n22. Prepare enough staining mix to cover each sample (~25\n\u00b5L). NOTE: See Table 1 for the antibodies and the final concentrations used here.\n23. Add 25 \u00b5L of staining mix to cover each organoid slice.\nIncubate at room temperature for 1 h or overnight at 4 \u00b0C in the dark. NOTE: Ensure that the samples remain at a high humidity to prevent the evaporation of the staining mix. If a container to keep the slides humid is not available, put them inside a box with some wet tissues on the corner.\n24. Wash the slides for 3 x 2 min with PBS.\n25. Rinse once with distilled water inside a glass slide\nstaining jar to remove the salt.\n26. Add 10 \u00b5L of liquid mountant + 4',6-diamidino-2-\nphenylindole (DAPI) to each of the samples. NOTE: The slides can be sealed if a second round of staining is not performed. Here, the slides were not covered to allow access for quenching/restaining as coverslip removal can damage the tissue.\n27. Image the slides using the selected fluorescence\nmicroscope. NOTE: Make sure to have positive and negative controls for each antibody to allow the proper setting of the\nintensities and exposure times (for the instrument used here, the illumination intensity was set between 5 and 6 and the exposure time between 2,000 ms and 3,000 ms), though this can vary depending on the antibody. Additionally, ensure the microscope has adequate detectors for each channel used. Be aware that as the samples are not covered, they need to be placed face up while imaging them.\n28. After imaging, prepare fresh 2x quenching buffer (9%\nH2O2 + 50 mM NaOH in PBS). NOTE: The quenching solution must be prepared fresh immediately before using it. The reaction is sensitive to the activity of the H2O2, which will decrease over time.CAUTION: H2O2 is an irritant, and NaOH is caustic. These should be treated with appropriate safety equipment, and skin contact should be avoided. Ensure they are disposed of in accordance with local chemical safety policies.\n29. Fill the glass Coplin slide staining jar halfway with 2x\nquenching buffer (45 mL), add 45 mL PBS, and put the slides inside. Incubate overnight at 4 \u00b0C.\n30. Check by fluorescence microscopy that the fluorophores\nwere effectively quenched.\n31. Repeat the staining and imaging as above.\nNOTE: The quenching and restaining can be repeated for additional rounds as needed, though the risk of damage increases with each additional round.\n5. Image registration\n1. Open FIJI.\n2. Make a folder with the DAPI images from round 1 and\nround 2. Change the names to clarify which is which, if needed.\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 JoVE Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License\njove.com July 2023 \u2022 197 \u2022 e64770 \u2022 Page 10 of 21\n3. Make an empty folder for the output of the image\nregistration.\n4. Click on Plugins | Registration | Register Virtual Stack\nSlices.\n5. Under Source directory, select the folder containing the\nDAPI images from each round.\n6. Under Output directory, select the folder made for the\nregistration output.\n7. Set the Feature extraction model to Rigid and\nthe Registration model dropdown menu to Rigid - translate+rotate to fix the registration, only allowing the image to be moved and rotated for alignment rather than be deformed. NOTE: Should deformation be expected, the feature extraction model and registration model could be adjusted to Affine or other models as desired, though this can result in undesired transformations. Occasionally a slice may be damaged between rounds, which can prevent successful registration.\n8. Check the Save transforms box to save the\ntransformation parameters, allowing them to be applied to the other channels.\n9. Click on OK.\n10. Select the location to save the transform file (defaults\nto the input directory), and click on Open.\n11. Select the DAPI image to serve as a reference for the\ntransforms. The DAPI image from each of the other rounds will be aligned to this one. NOTE: When complete, the registered images will appear as a stack (and in the output folder).\n12. Use the slide bar on the bottom to flip back and forth\nbetween the images to verify that the image registration\nwas successful (the nuclei are in the same place in both images, at least for the overlapping areas).\n13. Verify that an .xml file has been created for each round\nof the input images. NOTE: These contain the translation parameters needed for the files from that round.\n14. Make a folder containing all the images to be registered\n(each channel of each round). Note the order of the files.\n15. Make a folder for the transformation parameters, and\nmake one copy of the .xml file for each round per channel to be registered. Double-check that the file order (by name) is the same between the images to be registered and the transformation parameter copies, as the next step will go through and transform each image in the order of the transformation parameter files.\n16. Click on Plugins | Transform | Transform Virtual Stack\nSlices.\n17. Under Source directory, select the folder containing the\nimages to be registered.\n18. Under Output directory, select the folder made for the\nregistration output.\n19. Under Transforms directory, select the folder\ncontaining the .xml files with one copy per image file to be transformed. Again, make sure the order matches the files (i.e., one copy of the round 1 .xml for each round 1 channel, one copy of the round 2 .xml for each round 2 channel, etc.).\n20. Click on OK.\nNOTE: When complete, the registered images from that round will appear as a stack (and in the output folder).\n21. Use the slide bar on the bottom to flip back and forth\nbetween the channels. Verify that all the channels were\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 JoVE Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License\njove.com July 2023 \u2022 197 \u2022 e64770 \u2022 Page 11 of 21\ntransformed in the same way. If not, this is likely due to a wrong .xml file in the transforms directory; in this case, fix the file and repeat. NOTE: The brightness range displayed will be based on one channel, but this does not affect the actual saved images, just the display.\n22. Observe that the registered images are all successfully\naligned across rounds and ready for overlays/ downstream analysis. NOTE: There are more efficient programmatic ways to accomplish registration for large batches. The method presented here is just an easy one that does not require programming."

            "heading": "Representative Results",
            "text": "As a validation of the cerebral organoid identity, histological sections of a mature (2 month old) cerebral organoid were stained for PAX6 (a marker of dorsal NPCs23 ) and SATB2 (a marker of mature, postmitotic, upper-layer neurons24 ). As expected, PAX6+ cells were present at the interior of the organoid, and SATB2+ cells were present in the upper layers (Figure 2). These results support that the cerebral organoids used were indeed dorsal forebrain as specified in the differentiation kit. To establish the dose-dependence of the cerebral organoid transplant system, 2 month old cerebral organoids were injected with increasing numbers of EGFP+ iPSC-derived NPCs. A clear dose-dependence of GFP fluorescence on input cell number was present, with consistent EGFP+ cell patch detection at 10,000 cells and above (Figure 3). The persistence and migration of the transplanted NPCs were next assessed by following the transplanted organoids over time. For this, 50,000 iPSCderived EGFP+ NPCs were transplanted into 2-3 month old cerebral organoids generated from the same iPSC line.\nThe injected organoids and controls were imaged for EGFP positivity at indicated timepoints over the next 3-4 months. In this transplantation series, we observed persistence of the injected site throughout the 4 month tracking period (Figure 4A). Additional EGFP+ cell patches appeared by 9 days post transplantation and persisted until the study endpoint (3-4 months depending on the organoid), indicating the migration of the cells and integration at their new sites (Figure 4A). At a higher magnification, clear neural morphology was observable with long projections into the organoid (Figure 4B), confirming the integration of the injected cells.\nTo determine the differentiation status of the injected cells late post injection, the 4 month tracked organoid and its control were fixed, paraffin-embedded, cut to 15 \u00b5m thick slices, and mounted onto glass slides. The slices were then processed and stained in either a single round of fluorescent staining (EGFP, TUJ1, NESTIN) or for two consecutive staining cycles to add additional markers (MAP2, GFAP). The initial single-round staining confirmed the presence of EGFP+ cells at the injection site, including a mixture of cells retaining NPC status (NESTIN+TUJ1\u2212 ) and those that had differentiated towards a neural fate (NESTIN\u2212TUJ1+ ) (Figure 5). For both the control and injected organoids, very few NESTIN+ NPCs were observed (most, though not all being EGFP+ transplanted NPCs at the site of injection), with a majority of TUJ1+ immature-mature neurons (Figure 5). The two-round staining gave more detail, revealing mature neurons (NESTIN\u2212TUJ1+MAP2+GFAP\u2212 ) around most of the outer region of the organoid, with areas of immature (NESTIN\u2212TUJ1+MAP2\u2212GFAP\u2212 ) neurons toward the middle (Figure 6A,B). Astrocytes (NESTIN\u2212TUJ1\u2212MAP2\u2212GFAP+ ) were present in both the injected and control organoids and were interspersed around the outer edges (Figure 6A,B). The slice for which the two-round staining was performed in the\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 JoVE Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License\njove.com July 2023 \u2022 197 \u2022 e64770 \u2022 Page 12 of 21\ninjected organoid showed a small satellite colony of EGFP+ cells far from the injection site that had adopted the phenotype of mature neurons (Figure 6B,C). Some of these appeared to be in close proximity to astrocytes; however, there were\nno EGFP+ cells with complete overlap to the GFAP staining, suggesting they were adjacent rather than generating the astrocytes themselves (Figure 6B,C).\nFigure 1: Transplantation model of labeled cells into cerebral organoids.

A 2 month old cerebral organoid was fixed, paraffin-embedded, sliced, and stained with PAX6, SATB2, and DAPI. An unstained section was used to set the exposure and integration time to avoid a false-positive signal from autofluorescence. PAX6+ cells were present at the interior of the organoid, while SATB2+ cells were present in the upper layers. Z-stack images were taken every 4.2 \u00b5m through the whole 15 \u00b5m tissue section.

Single-channel fluorescence images from the non-injected, (A) age-matched, and (B) transplanted organoids are shown for the first and second round of staining as indicated. The display minimums were set to just exclude the signal from the negative cells (determined for EGFP from the non-injected control and for other channels based on known marker combinations).

            "text": "Given the significant interest in cell therapeutic approaches for the treatment of CNS injuries/neurodegenerative disorders1,2 ,3 ,4 ,5 ,6 ,7 ,8 , models of cell function in a transplant setting are gaining importance. This paper presents a method for the transplantation of labeled, human NPCs into human cerebral organoids, along with their livecell tracking and end-point assessment by histology and immunofluorescent staining. Importantly, we showed that the transplanted cells were capable of migration, differentiation, and long-term (4 month) persistence in the organoid setting. Such long-term persistence is a marked increase over the maintainability of brain slice cultures17 . This system is, thus, appropriate for examining many of the behaviors one would need to assess in a potential therapeutic setting, such as survival, proliferation, and differentiation. Indeed,\nan orthogonal study recently demonstrated that transplanted NPCs behaved similarly in cerebral organoids compared to NPCs transplanted into NSG mouse brains20 , thus confirming the utility of organoids as a transplant recipient. As this is an in vitro system, it is also straightforward to add cytokines or drugs of interest. This could be used to better understand the effects of specific environments such as inflammation and immunosuppressants on the transplanted cells to further mimic what they might encounter in a therapeutic setting. The cyclic immunofluorescence protocol we demonstrated (based on previous research21 ) further extends the power of this approach, allowing a wide array of lineage- and, potentially, disease-specific markers to be simultaneously assessed in a single section, and, thus, allowing accurate tracking of the transplanted cells and their impact on the tissue. Of course, other endpoint assessment methods could be used\nCopyright \u00a9 2023 JoVE Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs 3.0 Unported License\njove.com July 2023 \u2022 197 \u2022 e64770 \u2022 Page 19 of 21\ninstead depending on the goals of the analysis. For example, tissue clearing with 3D reconstruction could be used if cell morphology is of primary interest, or dissociation followed by flow cytometry could be used if the quantification of specific cell types is the end goal. We expect this method to be easily extensible to other cell types such as CNS tumors, potentially allowing their study in a microenvironmentally relevant context. Similarly, the organoids used as recipients could be exchanged for disease-model organoids25,26 ,27 , potentially allowing for the modeling of transplantation approaches for these conditions.\nAs with all models, the one presented here also has its own limitations. For one, iPSC-derived organoids are developmentally immature19 and, thus, have important differences compared to the aging brain, in which many neurodegenerative diseases manifest. Cerebral organoids are also non-uniform in development19 , thus precluding consistent injection into the same exact physiological niche. Moreover, while they contain the cell types of the relevant brain regions18, 19 , they lack the endothelial, microglial, and immune components, which are also important in the in vivo setting14 . This limits the study of how the host will react to the cell transplantation. Techniques are currently coming online to add vascular28 and microglial29 cells, as well as to increase the organoid consistency and regionalization18 , thus improving the modeling power of the organoid transplantation system. They would, however, require further testing and optimization beyond what is presented here. While this protocol is inexpensive and does not require specialized equipment, there remain a number of important technical considerations-the injection depth, for example. This is both due to the fact that organoids are not perfused and, thus, often have a necrotic center if they grow too large19 and that light cannot penetrate through the organoid core for\nlive-cell tracking. Thus, the cells that have been injected too deep and colonies that have migrated inside may be missed. While this can be ameliorated by the use of longerwavelength fluorophores with better tissue penetrance30 , depending on the organoid size and detection apparatus, this will likely remain a consideration. Finally, as brain organoids are in a state of development, the transplantation timing is another key consideration, as the environment will likely differ depending on the developmental stage of the organoid into which it is injected. While this can be controlled to some extent by ensuring a consistent organoid age at time of injection, it is, without doubt, a factor that needs consideration.\nThis protocol is inexpensive, simple, animal-free, and does not require specialized equipment, thus making transplantation modeling accessible to a wider variety of labs. With the rapid pace of advancement both in neural cell therapeutics and organoid model systems, we anticipate that the organoid transplantation protocol presented here will be a useful model for a range of diseases and therapeutic approaches."
