    "abstractText": "This article presents a comprehensive comparison of three control strategies used for gridfollowing inverters (GFLIs). The first strategy is the phase-locked loop (PLL)-based vector current control (VCC), and the other two PLL-less controllers are the voltage-modulated direct power control (VMDPC) and the linear-parameter-varying power-synchronized control (LPV-PSC). The VCC relies on the PLL to synchronize with the grid frequency to control the exchanged real and reactive power with the grid, which may result in instability issues under weak grid conditions. To prevent this, the VMDPC and LPVPSC are proposed recently as PLL-less approaches to overcome the difficulties of the VCC in weak grid conditions. The performance of the VCC, VMDPC, and LPV-PSC are comprehensively reviewed in this article, considering the operations of the GFLIs under both strong and weak grids. In each operation mode, the provided tests investigate: 1) step response of active and reactive power, 2) frequency jump in the grid voltage source, 3) phase jump in the grid voltage source, and 4) voltage sag in the grid voltage source. In addition to evaluating the three controllers in the time domain, the frequency domain impedance-based stability analysis based on the generalized Nyquist criterion is also considered, which confirms the time domain findings in terms of accurate predictions of the stable/unstable operations of the GFLIs that are equipped with these controllers. It is found that, compared to the conventional VCC and the VMDPC, the LPV-PSC has promising performance under various test conditions in both strong and weak grids, which may be a future solution for weak-grids connection of GFLIs.

INTRODUCTION\nTHE rapid developments of renewable energy technolo-gies have significantly accelerated the integration of inverter-based resources (IBRs) into the existing power systems. The main advantages of such IBRs are their high reliability, high energy conversion efficiency, and fast dynamic response. Furthermore, the IBRs are flexible as they can be integrated into different voltage levels such as medium voltage (e.g., solar and wind farms) and low voltage distribution networks (e.g., rooftop PV systems). Additionally, the control of these inverters can be configured to enable either\nislanded operations or grid-connected operations. On the one hand, in the islanded mode, the main objective of the IBRs is to regulate the microgrid voltage and frequency to their desired commands. On the other hand, in the grid-connected mode, the IBRs control the injected active power to the grid according to either the desired set-points (e.g., grid-connected battery energy storage systems) or the available power capacity at the DC side (e.g., PV systems). Besides active power injection, the IBRs operating in gridconnected mode can provide ancillary services to the grid [1], such as reactive power injection, low-order harmonic\nVOLUME 4, 2016 1\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

This article focuses on the IBRs operation in the grid-connected mode, where it is also expected that the IBRs should be resilient and flexible to adapt to various abnormal operating conditions, including frequency jumps and voltage sags.\nVarious control techniques are proposed for gridconnected voltage source converters. These control methods are being implemented in either the stationary reference frame (\u03b1\u03b20) or in the synchronous (dq) reference frame [6]. While these two reference frames enable independent control of the injected active and reactive power to the grid, the dq reference frame is preferred due to its simplicity. In the dq reference frame, the control signals, i.e., current and voltage, appear as dc quantities that are rotating at the grid fundamental frequency. The conventional vector current control (VCC) is widely used in the literature to control gridconnected inverters [7], [8]. Realization of the VCC is based on the widely-used phase-locked loop (PLL) synchronized with the grid frequency. The VCC is designed in the dq reference frame in which proportional-integral (PI)-based controllers can be used to control the d- and q-axis currents independently; hence, the injected active and reactive power to the grid, independently.\nWhile the VCC-based inverters seamlessly operate in normal conditions of strong grids and enable the export of the maximum power, their performance deteriorates under abnormal operating conditions, such as the occurrence of an unbalanced grid voltage that results in uncontrollable oscillations in the dq-reference frame at double the grid fundamental frequency [9]. Most notably, the control capability of the VCC deteriorates significantly in weak grids, as it relies on the PLL that may eventually lead to instability issues in very weak grids [10]. These raised challenges are becoming more concerning with the continuous and fastincreasing penetration of IBRs and the recommendations worldwide to phase out coal-based power stations, which leads to undesired system strength reduction.\nTo obviate the shortcomings of the PLL-based VCC, several PLL-less control methods are developed for IBRs. For example, the voltage-modulated direct power control (VMDPC) is proposed in [11], where the DPC concept is initially proposed in [12]. Another PLL-less control method proposed recently is the linear-parameter-varying powersynchronized control (LPV-PSC) [13]. Compared with the conventional VCC approach, the VMDPC does not require a PLL. Therefore, the associated instability problems with PLLs are eliminated. However, the performance of the VMDPC in a weak grid can deteriorate, as it still requires the point-of-common-coupling (PCC) voltage to control the power exchange with the grid that significantly affects the PCC voltage [14]. The LPV-PSC for the grid-following inverter (GFLI) also does not use a PLL [13]. This control approach offers several advantages, such as its capabilities for operation in both strong and weak grids. Additionally, the operation of the LPV-PSC is preserved in all operating points.\nL Filter\nDC Source Inverter\nAlthough a comprehensive investigation of the performance of the PLL-based VCC and the PLL-less VMDPC is recently presented in [15], the comparisons are only conducted in the time domain and only by considering the VCC and the VMDPC. Therefore, there is a need for a detailed comparison between the conventional PLL-based VCC, the PLL-less VMDPC, and the PLL-less LPV-PSC, which evaluates the performance of these control systems in both time domain and frequency domain. Furthermore, in recent literature, the frequency domain stability assessment of IBRs, mainly using the impedance-based stability criterion, is proven to accurately predict system stability [16]\u2013[19].\nThis article comprehensively evaluates the performance of the aforementioned three control strategies: the PLL-based VCC, the PLL-less VMDPC, and the PLL-less LPV-PSC control system for the GFLIs. First, the performance of the three controllers is tested in strong grid conditions under normal and severe operating conditions, such as step change of power reference commands, frequency jump, phase jump, sag in the PCC voltage, and faults in the PCC. Second, the control strategies are tested under similar test conditions in weak grid conditions. Finally, the impedance-based stability analysis based on the Generalized Nyquist Criterion (GNC) is performed to confirm these time domain simulation results obtained under both strong and weak grid conditions. The obtained frequency domain stability conclusions verify the correctness of the time domain simulation results.\nThe rest of this article is organized as follows. Section II briefly describes the three control strategies for the GFLIs that are considered in this article. Section III presents a comprehensive time domain comparison among the three controllers with different operating points under strong and weak grid conditions. In Section IV, the frequency domain impedance-based analysis is performed to verify the time domain analysis results. Based on the time domain and frequency domain analysis results, Section V summarizes the findings in both the time and frequency domains and provides some practical application guidelines. Finally, Section VI draws the conclusions of this article."

These controllers are the standard VCC equipped with an open-loop power control strategy, the VMDPC, and the LPV-PSC control. The system under study is a two-level three-phase voltage source inverter (VSI), as shown in Fig. 1. The VSI is interfaced with the utility grid using an L-filter denoted by Lf with an internal resistance Rf . The three-phase voltages (vpcc) and currents (ipcc) at the PCC are measured and used in the feedback controller and also in the calculation of the exported active (Ppcc) and reactive (Qpcc) power to the grid. The grid is modelled as an ideal voltage source with an equivalent Thevenin impedance consisting of the grid resistance Rg and the grid inductance Lg. Further details on the three controller models are discussed below.\nA. VECTOR CURRENT CONTROL\nFig. 2 shows the IBR equipped with the conventional VCC. The main goal of the controller is to regulate the PCC current (or power) exchange with the grid to the desired reference commands, idq, ref and idq, ref (or Pref and Qref ), which are generated by external power control loops. The main difference between the VCC and the other two control models used for comparison purposes in this article is the synchronization method with the grid. The VCC is a PLLbased method, whereas both the VMDPC and LPV-PSC are PLL-less control strategies.\nThe VCC is implemented in the dq reference frame, where the synchronous reference frame PLL (SRF-PLL) is commonly used to extract the phase angle \u03b8 = \u03c9t of the grid voltage measured at the PCC. Its work principle is to force the q-component of this voltage to zero. Consequently, decoupling of the real and reactive power control is achieved. Therefore, the control contains two decoupled control axes, i.e., the d-component for the active power control and the q-\ncomponent for the reactive power control. In the literature, it is recommended to design the SRF-PLL with a cut-off frequency around tens of Hertz [20]. Hence, in this article, the PI controller gains are selected Kp\u2212pll = 0.292 and Ki\u2212pll = 42.2, providing a cut off frequency of 50 Hz and a phase margin of 65\u25e6.\nAs shown in Fig. 2, it can be seen that the dq current references (idq, ref ) for the VCC are either specified directly or generated from the outer open-loop power control (OLPC). The inputs for the OLPC are the desired power references (Pref and Qref ), and the d and q components of the measured PCC voltage (Vd and Vq). These measured components can be used directly for the current reference calculations, or they can be filtered first using low-pass filters (LPF). In this article, both cases of using Vd and Vq without/with LPF are investigated. For the second case, Vd and Vq filtering is realized using a second-order LPF with a transfer function as\nGLPF(s) = \u03c92f\ns2 + 2\u03b6LPF\u03c9fs+ \u03c9f 2 , (1)\nwhere the damping ratio and the natural frequency are designed as \u03b6LPF = 0.7 and \u03c9f= 2\u03c0200 rad/s, respectively.\nSection IV-A compares the time domain performance of the three approaches to generate the current reference commands in the dq reference frame (id, ref and iq, ref ). In addition to the analysis in the time domain, further insights on the stability and these differences between the OLPC with and without the LPF used to filter Vd and Vq are explored in the frequency domain, as shown in Section III."

LINEAR-PARAMETER-VARYING POWER-SYNCHRONIZED CONTROL Fig. 4 shows the control structure of the LPV-PSC. It is a PLL-less control approach that is proposed recently for both very weak and strong grid conditions without being prone to instability [13]. The LPV-PSC control method regulates the output active and reactive power at the inverter terminal instead of the PCC, similar to the power-synchronized gridfollowing inverter [14].\nThe LPV-PSC loop-shaping controller is a class of nonlinear systems. The system parameters are a function of some scheduling variables that can be measured in real-time operation. A nonlinear system that is linearized around some operating points is called an LPV-PSC system, in which the scheduling variables are the operating point parameters [21]. The parameters of the LPV-PSC controller are tuned automatically in real time according to the variation of the operating points, maintaining a constant rise time for different\noperating points, and a straightforward control design based on the IBR operating point [13].\nIt is worth mentioning that the main purpose of this paper is to provide a comprehensive comparison of the above three control strategies in frequency and time domain and the interested reader can refer to the literature review for the theoretical models of these existing control strategies"

The grid is modelled by the Thevenin equivalent circuit consisting of an ideal voltage\nsource (Vg) in series with the grid impedance (Zg). The current flowing from the inverter to the grid is expressed as follows:\nIg = [Iinv \u2212 Vg Zo ]. 1\n1 + Zg Zo\n, (3)\nwhere the impedance ZgZo is the ratio of the grid impedance to the inverter output impedance. This impedance ratio, also called the minor loop gain (Tml), should satisfy the GNC in order for the system to be stable. The stability of the gridconnected inverter system can be assessed based on the GNC using the following equation [23]:\nP (Tclm) = P (Tml)\u2212N(\u22121,j0)P (Tml), (4)\nwhere P (Tclm) and P (Tml) are the numbers of the righthand poles (RHP) of the closed minor loop gain and the minor loop gain, respectively.

The cross-coupling impedances Zgdq(s) and Zgqd(s) can be neglected due to their small values during inverter operation at the unity power factor [26]. Hence, it is sufficient to perform the stability analysis in the d-axis and qaxis based on the diagonal elements. Additionally, it is worth mentioning that for the RL model of the grid impedance, -Zgdq(s) and Zgqd(s) are equal. Therefore, it is sufficient to obtain Zgdd(s) or Zgqq(s) [27]. Then, the impedance information can be used for stability analysis purposes.\nThe minor loop gains of the diagonal elements in the d-axis (Tml\u2212d) and in the q-axis (Tml\u2212q) are:\nTml\u2212d = Zgdd Zodd , (7)\nTml\u2212q = Zgqq Zoqq . (8)\nTo compare the stability of the VCC, VMDPC, and LPVPSC, the impedance-based stability analysis of the three control techniques is investigated in this part, considering the operation in three grid conditions: strong, weak, and very weak grids. In addition, the stability is assessed for all inverters while operating at unity power factor, in which the power reference commands are set as Pref= 4 MW and Qref= 0 MVar.\nThe first step to perform the impedance-based stability analysis in the dq reference frame is required to obtain both 1) the output impedance of the inverter in the d-axis (Zodd) and in the q-axis (Zoqq), and 2) the grid impedance in the daxis (Zgdd) and in the q-axis (Zgqq). While Zodd and Zoqq are calculated analytically, Zgdd and Zgqq can be accurately estimated online by the inverter itself [19], [28], [29].\nFig. 6(a)-(d) present the output impedances of the VCCOLPC and the VCC-OLPC with the Vdq LPF in both the daxis and q-axis. Based on the Bode plots, on the one hand, it can be seen that the systems are stable in the d-axis as the phase angle differences between Zodd and Zgdd in strong (Zg1), weak (Zg2), and very weak (Zg3) grids are less than 180\u25e6. On the other hand, Fig. 6(c) predicts that the VCCOLPC will be stable only in a strong grid condition. However, the inverter will not be stable if it is required to inject its rated active power without the support of reactive power injection, where the phase angle differences between Zodd and Zgdd in both weak and very weak grids are 242\u25e6 and 251\u25e6, which are greater than the maximum limit of 180\u25e6 [30].\nThe predicted (in)stability phenomenon of the VCC in a weak grid is in accordance with the time domain simulation\nresults shown in Fig. 8(a), where the step change is applied at 0.2 s in the active power references from Pref = 2 MW to Pref = 4 MW and a step change in the reactive power from Qref = 2 MVar to Qref = 0 MVar at 0.24 s. The instability of the VCC shows a poor dynamic response in very weak grid conditions, resulting in an undamped oscillatory response. Additionally, the VCC controller fails to regulate the PCC active power to its desired reference after 0.24 s, as shown in Fig. 8(d).\nIn addition, adopting the second-order LPF, presented in (1), in the control loop increases the stability margin of the VCC. For example, the inverter can now inject its rated active power without the need to inject reactive power in weak grid conditions. Now, the phase angle difference is 162\u25e6, less than the maximum limit of 180\u25e6. Fig. 6(d) also shows that adding the LPF improves the stability margin in both strong and very weak grids. However, the operation in a weak grid is still unstable, as the phase angle difference between the Zoqq and Zg3 is 215\u25e6 at 73 Hz.\nThe corresponding Nyquist diagrams based on (7) for VCC equipped with the OLPC without and with the LPF are shown in Fig. 6(e)-(h). For the VCC-OLPC without the LPF, it is evident in Fig. 6(e) that the characteristic loci in the daxis do not encircle the critical point (-1, j0) in the cases of SCR = 16.8, 3.21, and 1.21. Fig. 6(g) predicts the unstable operation of the system in both weak and very weak grids as the root loci encircle the critical point (-1, j0), confirming the previous findings obtained from Bode plots as presented in Fig. 6(c). However, the Nyquist diagrams in the q-axis based on (8) for VCC equipped with the OLPC with the LPF indicate that only the characteristic loci encircle the critical point (-1, j0) in case of very weak grid conditions.\nFig. 7 presents a similar analysis applied to the gridconnected inverters equipped with the VMDPC and LPVPSC. For both controllers, the output impedances are obtained for the same operation point in which the power reference commands are set as Pref = 4 MW and Qref = 0 MVar.\nIt is evident from the Bode plot that for the q axis of the VMDPC, as shown in Fig. 7(c), that the system stability margin is decreased under weak grid conditions. These results are confirmed by the corresponding Nyquist diagrams presented in Fig. 7(g), where the root loci are approaching the critical point (-1, j0) in a very weak grid with an SCR = 1.21.\nFig. 6(g) predicts the unstable operation of the system in both weak and very weak grid conditions, since the root loci encircle the critical point (-1, j0), confirming the previous findings, including the Bode plot results presented Fig. 6(c). These findings also will be verified by the time domain simulation results as shown in Fig. 9 and in Fig. 14 for strong and weak grid conditions.\nLastly, the analysis of the PLL-less LPV-PSC is presented in Fig. 7. It can be observed clearly from the Bode plot of the minor loops in the d-axis and q-axis, shown in Fig. 7(b) and Fig. 7(d), respectively, that the phase margins are much higher than those of the VCC and VMDPC. For example, the phase margins of the VMDPC and the LPV-PSC in the q axis during the operation in a very weak grid are 39\u25e6 and 51\u25e6,"

TIME DOMAIN RESULTS To further assess the performance of the three controllers, MATLAB/Simulink is used. The block diagrams of the simulated VCC, VMDPC, and LPV-PSC control systems are shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 3, and Fig. 4, respectively. The parameters of the three control systems used in the simulation are listed in Table 1.\nAs different approaches can be used to generate current reference commands, the effects of three different current reference generation methods for the VCC are initially studied in strong and weak grids. Then, the performance of the VCC, VMDPC, and LPV-PSC controllers is evaluated for operating in strong, weak and very weak grids. In each operating condition, five different scenarios are evaluated: 1) step change of active and reactive power, 2) frequency jump, 3) phase jump, 4) three-phase permanent voltage sag in the grid voltage, and 5) three-phase fault at the PCC for a duration of 100 ms.\nA. EFFECTS OF THREE CURRENT REFERENCE GENERATION METHODS FOR THE VCC\nFig. 8 compares the time domain response of the VCC for the different approaches to generate idq, ref in strong and weak grid conditions. First, the response of the VCC when id, ref and iq, ref are directly specified to the inner current controller (ICC), without using the OLPC, is also shown in the same figure, and this case study is donated by the VCCICC. The second and third cases correspond to the VCC when the idq, ref is generated by the outer loop using non-filtered and filtered Vd and Vq, denoted by \"VCC-OLPC\" and \"VCCOLPC with filter\", respectively. Furthermore, the response of the VCC when id, ref and iq, ref are directly specified to the inner current controller (ICC), without using the OLPC, is also shown in the same figure, and this case study is donated by the VCC-ICC.\nThe presented results in Fig. 8 consider three different grid conditions, i.e., a strong grid with a short circuit ratio (SCR) equal to 16.8, a weak grid with an SCR equal to 3.21, and a very weak grid with an SCR equal to 1.21. For a strong grid scenario shown in Fig. 8(a)-(c), it can be observed that the measured power at the PCC (i.e., P and Q) follows the reference power command with zero steady-state error only for the case of VCC-OLPC with filter. On the contrary, the VCC-OLPC produces steady-state oscillations in the injected power to the grid, and the VCC-ICC injects slightly higher power than the desired power commands. The differences between the VCC-ICC, VCC-OLPC, and VCC-OLPC with filter become clearer under a weak grid shown in Fig. 8(d)(f) and a very weak grid shown in Fig. 8(g)-(i). In a weak grid scenario, in contrast to both the VCC-ICC and VCC-OLPC, only VCC-OLPC with filter is able to track the desired active and reactive power reference commands with zero steadystate errors, as shown in Fig. 8(e) and Fig. 8(f), respectively.\nThe effects of these three approaches followed to generate id, ref and iq, ref become very clear in a very weak grid conditions. First, the VCC-ICC fails to operate, where the controller is unstable even when the inverter injects half of its rated reactive power (Qref = 1.5 MVar) to support the grid. However, the OLPC and VCC-OLPC with filter maintain stable operation as long as the inverter supports the grid with reactive power. For example, the operation of these two control approaches becomes unstable only at t = 0.24 s after the reactive power reference command is set to zero, e.g., Qref = 0 MVar.\nFor the comparison study in the time domain with the VMDPC and LPV-PSC presented in the rest of this section, the VCC-OLPC with filter is used. Hence, for simplicity, the abbreviation \"VCC\" is used instead of \"VCC-OLPC with filter\"."

First, the three control systems operate in steady-state conditions, where the active and reactive power references are set to Pref = 2 MW and Qref = 1.5 MVar, respectively. Then, a step change of the active power to Pref = 4MW is applied at t = 3 s. Finally, a step change of the reactive power Qref to 0 MVar is applied at t = 5 s. Fig. 9(a), (d), and (g) shows the inverter output current when the VCC, VMDPC, and LPV-PSC are in service, respectively.\nDifferently from the VCC and VMDPC, it should be noted that the measured active and reactive power of the LPVPSC shown in Fig. 9(b) are the terminal power instead of the PCC power, where the PCC power is slightly lower than the desired references due to the power consumption caused by the L filter. Therefore, as for the results presented in this article, the terminal active and reactive powers of the LPVPSC are used because the LPV-PSC control regulates the terminal power (e.g., before the L-filter) instead of the PCC power (e,g, after the L-filter).\nFig. 9(b) shows that the three controllers are able to track the power reference commands with zero steady-state error. Compared to their VMDPC counterparts, the dynamic responses of the VCC and LPV-PSC are faster and more damped responses under step changes in the active and reactive power reference commands.

Then, this grid frequency is reduced by 0.05 Hz each time at t = 3 s. The reported results are shown in Fig. 10. Overall, it can be seen that the VCC and LPV-PSC controllers are shown to be robust against the frequency jump, and they track the grid frequency with zero overshoot as shown in Fig. 10(c), (f) and (i) [31]. Furthermore, there are no overshoots in the injected current and power in response to the slight drop in frequency, as shown in Fig. 10(a), (d), (f), (b), (d), and (h), respectively.\nCompared to the VCC, the PLL-less LPV-PSC has a faster response after the frequency excursion events. Notably, the injected active power and reactive power by the LPV-PSC are slightly drifted from the desired references. However, Fig. 10 shows that the VMDPC is less stable and has a large transient during the frequency jump at t = 3 s.

Then, three-phase faults in the PCC are applied at t = 3 s for a time duration of t = 0.1 s. The applied faults are tested in three different values for the fault resistances (Rf ). For example, for the first fault shown in Fig. 13, the Rf is set to 5 m\u2126, whereas Rf is set to 10 m\u2126 and 20 m\u2126 for the second and third faults, respectively.\nFig. 13(a), (d), and (g) show the output current of the inverters. In general, it can be seen that the fault currents increase for small values of Rf . The VMDPC fails to stay synchronized with the grid frequency for transients at t = 3 s, t = 3.1 s, and the time interval between the occurrence and clearance of a fault. On the other hand, the VCC and the LPVPSC are able to be kept synchronized with the grid frequency, and they maintain the amplitudes of the injected real and reactive power to the grid during the fault events, which are much smaller than the injected powers by the VMDPC."

Then, the LPV-PSC control system has good performance. In contrast, there is a slight steady-state increase in the inverter output active power and a slight steady-state decrease in the inverter output reactive power as shown in Fig. 14(b), (e), and (h) that are associated with the frequency decrease to 49.5 Hz, 94.0 Hz, and 48.5 Hz, respectively. Similarly to operation in a strong grid, the LPVPSC is faster to capture the changes in grid frequency than the VCC, as presented in Fig. 14 (c), (f), and (i).\nIn contrast to the stable operation of the VCC and LPVPSC, the performance of the inverter equipped with the VMDPC is significantly affected by the frequency jump events. For instance, the VMDPC produces oscillations in the output current that last more than one second for a frequency excursion below 49 Hz, as presented in Fig. 14(g). Another example is the sudden drop of the injected reactive power. It\njumps from Q = 1.5 MVar to around Q = -3 MVar, when the grid frequency is decreased from 50 Hz to 48.5 Hz, as shown in Fig. 14(h).

In summary, the VCC and LPVPSC show to remain very stable under the three different phase jump events. There are almost no overshoots, and the controllers remain synchronized with the grid frequency, as shown in Fig. 16(a) and (d). In contrast, the VMDPC is less robust to phase jumps. For instance, the inverter output active power is reduced sharply from P = 4 MW to P = -5 MW during the phase angle jump of 45\u25e6.

It can be observed that the VCC and LPV-PSC outperform the VMDPC in terms of overshoot in the active and reactive powers at the moment of voltage sage occurrence at t = 3 s. For instance, while the active power injected by the VMDPC increases suddenly from P = 4 MW to P = 9.5 MW during the grid voltage sag with the amplitude of 50%Vg, as shown in Fig. 17(e), the injected power by the VCC and LPV-PSC vary by around P = 1 MW in correspondence to the same grid voltage sag event. Similar observations are shown in the inverter output reactive power response for the two grid voltage sag events, as shown in Fig. 17(c) and (f).\nNotably, considering both grid voltage sag events, the LPV-PSC shows to have no overshoot in the inverter output current, as presented in Fig. 17(a) and (d).

It can be noticed that both the VCC and LPV-PSC achieve better transient responses than the VMDPC. Moreover, the LPV-PSC outperforms the VCC in terms of the amplitude of the produced current during the faults. In contrast to the VCC and LPV-PSC, the frequency of generated current by the VMDPC is drifted during the fault events. Therefore, it requires a longer time to re-synchronize with the grid frequency. For example, the VMDPC needs around t = 0.4 s to fully re-synchronize after the faults clearance at t = 3.1 s.\nAnother remarkable observation is the significant peaks of the injected active and reactive power by the LPV-PSC during the fault clearance at t = 3.1 s.\nD. PERFORMANCE OF VCC,VMDPC, AND LPV-PSC IN VERY WEAK GRIDS\nFig. 19 compares the three controllers in a very weak grid condition (SCR = 1.21). Fig. 19(a), (b), and (c) present the inverters output current, power, and frequency in a very weak grid, respectively. It can be seen that only the LPV-PSC performs well during the step change in both the active and reactive power reference commands. On the contrary, the VCC fails completely for t \u2265 5 s to regulate the active power to its desired references. This behaviour agrees with our previous findings in [32]. Although it regulates the active and reactive power to their references for t \u2265 5 s better than the VCC, the VMDPC shows a poor dynamic response. For instance, the change in the active power reference at t = 5 s produces oscillations in the reactive power, as shown in Fig. 14(f). This indicates the strong coupling between the active and reactive power that hinders the accurate operation of the VMDPC in very weak grids for the same control parameters listed in Table 1 that are designed based\non performance trade-offs in maintaining fast response in a strong grid and stable operation in a weak grid.\nFurthermore, both the VCC and the LPV-PSC perform well under power reference changes, frequency jump, phase jump, and fault tests. For example, contrary to the VMDPC, the VCC and the LPV-PSC maintain a stable operation after a few fundamental cycles after the fault clearance at 3.1 s. In contrast, even with the reactive power support, the VCC cannot maintain the operation under the permanent voltage sag. This is explained by the network capacity (SCR), which is decreased after applying the voltage sag. In contrast, the VMDPC has poor dynamic performance, and it requires longer time to reach steady-state operation. Furthermore, compared with its performance under weak grid conditions, the VMDPC is less robust in a very weak grid."

It is worth mentioning that the VMDPC can be redesigned to provide a fast-tracking response by increasing the controller parameters. However, this solution will negatively impact the stability of the VMDPC in weak grid conditions, especially for high power applications where grid-connected inverters are\nas large as several MWs. Hence, such an inherent tradeoff between the fast dynamic response in a strong grid and the stability in a weak grid limits the reliable operation of the VMDPC in different grid conditions. It is worth mentioning that there are certain limitations on controlling the active and reactive power via VMDPC and LPV-PSC strategies. On the one hand, the VMDPC approach needs the injection of a certain\nVOLUME 4, 2016 17\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 License.

On the other hand, the LPV-PSC approach can be driven to instability when the inverter is expected to inject low amounts of active power. To overcome this limitation for the LPV-PSC, two possible solutions are suggested. The first solution is to inject a certain amount of reactive power when low real power is being injected. The second solution is to freeze the parameters of the power\ncontroller when the set-point of the active power is low. Hence, the stability of the LPV-PSC approach is ensured for low injections of low amounts of active without the need for reactive power support. 2) Control interaction stability: The three controllers, i.e., the VCC, VMDPC, and LPV-PSC, are stable in strong grid operation. It is worth mentioning that the stability of the VCC mainly depends on the tuning of its SRFPLL. In this study, the PLL was turned initially in"

Hence, it is unstable in very weak grid conditions, even though the controller was able to cope with weak grid operation due to the welldesigned PLL. 3) Frequency jumps: The VCC outperforms the other two controllers. It is shown that a very robust operation against different frequency jumps in the grid voltage source. Although the LPV-PSC also shows good performance in such abnormal conditions, and it is able to track the grid frequency even faster than the VCC, the frequency jump results in a steady-state error in the injected active and reactive power by the VMDPCbased inverter, in which any drift in the grid frequency results in a slight steady-state increase and decrease in the output active and reactive power of the LPVPSC, respectively. In contrast to VCC and LPV-PSC, the VMDPC is very sensitive to grid frequency deviations, where high overshoots in both the output active and reactive powers are generated in response to the frequency drifts, and it is found that the controller needs to move a long time that may exceed one second to recover to its operating status before the frequency disturbance. 4) Phase jumps: Both the VCC and LPV-PSC prove to be very robust to various phase jump values in the grid voltage source. The two controllers adapt to the phase changes very fast, where the effects of the phase jump are mitigated from the output current waveforms in less than one half fundamental cycle (< 10) msec. However, the VMDPC is very sensitive to phase jumps in the grid voltage, where very high spikes in the output active and reactive powers are generated by the controller. 5) Grid voltage sags: It is found that the LPV-PSC outperforms the VCC and VMDPC. It produces the lowest transient current amplitude of the three control systems due to symmetrical voltage sags in the grid voltage source. Again, the VCC still performed better than the VMDPC for this abnormal controller. 6) PCC faults: During three-phase symmetrical faults at the PCC for different fault resistances, it is shown that the VMDPC fails to stay synchronized with the grid frequency during the transients and the time interval between the occurrence and clearance of a fault. On the other hand, VCC and LPV-PSC controllers are able to still synchronize with the grid frequency, and they maintain the amplitudes of the injected real and reactive power to the grid during the fault events much smaller than the injected powers by the VMDPC.\nB. VCC, VMDPC, AND LPV-PSC IN (VERY) WEAK GRID CONDITIONS Overall, the LPV-PSC outperforms both the VCC and VMDPC controllers, as summarized below.\n1) Control of active and reactive power: The LPV-PSC allows full control of the injected active and reactive\npower, independently, in both weak and very weak grid conditions. However, it is found that it is required to inject a certain amount of reactive power in order to support the active power control in weak grid operation. This phenomenon becomes more clear in very weak grid conditions in which the VCC fails completely to regulate its active power after reducing the reactive power injection to zero. For the VMDPC, setting the reactive power to zero affects directly the controller performance in the form of undamped oscillations in the inverter output active power. 2) Control interaction stability: Overall, the LPV-PSC is the most robust controller in both weak and very weak grid conditions, where the phase margin of the minor loop is always below the maximum limit of 180\u25e6. On the other hand, the VCC is unstable under a very weak grid. It is worth mentioning that the stability of both VCC and the VMDPC can be improved to cope even with a very weak grid operation if the controller parameters are redesigned to cope with such conditions. For example, the control parameters of the PI-controller of the SRF-PLL could be redesigned. Moreover, the power control parameters for the VMDPC power controller can be varied to cope with weak grid operations. However, there is always a trade-off between stability and good performance in both weak and strong grids. 3) Frequency and phase jumps: Similar to strong grid conditions, the VMDPC is the most sensitive controller to both the jumps in the frequency and phase of the grid voltage source. The VCC and LPV-PSC are very robust to these abnormal operations. Again, the LPV-PSC tracks the frequency variations faster than the VCC. However, these variations in the frequency produce steady-state errors in the output active and reactive power of the LPV-PSC. 4) Grid voltage sags and PCC faults: It is found that the LPV-PSC is the most stable controller under the permanent grid voltage sags and under the PCC faults. Compared to the three controllers, the VMDPC has the poorest dynamic performance under these abnormal fault conditions."

            "text": "This comparison study extensively assesses the performance of GFLIs equipped with three different control strategies, i.e., the conventional VCC, VMDPC, and LPV-PSC. The performance of the three controllers is tested and compared in strong and weak grid conditions under normal and severe operating conditions such as step change in power reference commands, frequency jump, phase jump, and sag in the PCC voltage. On the one hand, it is shown that the PLL-based VCC performs well in strong grid conditions. On the other hand, its performance deteriorates when connected to a weak grid due to the instability issues posed by the PLL. This finding is also confirmed using impedance-based stability analysis in the dq reference frame based on the GNC.

Nevertheless, the presented results prove the superiority of the LPV-PSC compared to the VMDPC. The frequency domain analysis results confirm that the GFLIs equipped with LPV-PSC are more stable in the dq reference frame. Compared with the VCC and VMDPC, both the time domain and frequency domain results confirm the effectiveness of the recently proposed LPV-PSC scheme in terms of fast transient response, good tracking accuracy, and immunity to abnormal conditions, including frequency and SCR variations. Hence, it can be concluded that the LPV-PSC may be a promising control technique for GFLIs operating in both strong and weak grids.\nREFERENCES [1] E. Demirok, D. Sera, R. Teodorescu, P.
