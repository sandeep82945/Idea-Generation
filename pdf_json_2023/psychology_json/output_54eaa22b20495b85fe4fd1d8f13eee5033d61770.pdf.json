    "abstractText": "Background Over the last years, several strategies have been reported to improve the metabolic stability of minigas\u2010 trin analogs. However, currently applied compounds still reveal limited in vitro and in vivo stability. We thus performed a glycine scan at the N\u2010terminus of DOTA\u2010MGS5 (DOTA\u2010d\u2010Glu\u2010Ala\u2010Tyr\u2010Gly\u2010Trp\u2010(N\u2010Me)Nle\u2010Asp\u20101\u2010Nal) to systematically analyze the peptide structure. We substituted N\u2010terminal amino acids by simple PEG spacers and investigated in vitro stability in human serum. Furthermore, we evaluated different modifications on its tetrapeptide binding sequence (H\u2010Trp\u2010(N\u2010Me)Nle\u2010Asp\u20101\u2010Nal\u2010NH2). Results Affinity data of all glycine scan peptides were found to be in a low nanomolar range (4.2\u20138.5 nM). However, a truncated compound lacking the d\u2010\u03b3\u2010Glu\u2010Ala\u2010Tyr sequence revealed a significant loss in CCK\u20102R affinity. Substitu\u2010 tion of the d\u2010\u03b3\u2010Glu\u2010Ala\u2010Tyr\u2010Gly sequence of DOTA\u2010\u03b3\u2010MGS5 (DOTA\u2010 d\u2010\u03b3\u2010Glu\u2010Ala\u2010Tyr\u2010Gly\u2010Trp\u2010(N-Me)Nle\u2010Asp\u20101\u2010Nal\u2010NH2) by polyethylene glycol (PEG) spacers of different length exhibited only a minor influence on CCK\u20102R affinity and lipo\u2010 philicity. However, in vitro stability of the PEG\u2010containing compounds was significantly decreased. In addition, we confirmed that the tetrapeptide sequence H\u2010Trp\u2010Asp\u2010(N-Me)Nle\u20101\u2010Nal\u2010NH2 is indeed sufficient for high CCK\u20102R affinity. Conclusion We could demonstrate that a substitution of d\u2010\u03b3\u2010Glu\u2010Ala\u2010Tyr\u2010Gly by PEG spacers simplified the peptide structure of DOTA\u2010MGS5 while high CCK\u20102R affinity and favorable lipophilicity were maintained. Nevertheless, further optimization with regard to metabolic stability must be carried out for these minigastrin analogs.",

            "text": "In 1999, Behr et\u00a0al. reported first studies on the human peptide hormone minigastrin (H-Leu-(GIu)5-Ala-TyrGly-Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2) and its diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA)-conjugated analog targeting the cholecystokinin-2 receptor (CCK-2R) [1], which is overexpressed in a high percentage on several human tumor types such as medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC, 92%), small cell lung cancer (57%), stromal ovarian cancer (100%) and astrocytoma (65%) [2, 3]. Over the years, many modifications have been published, improving the pharmacokinetic properties of radiolabeled minigastrin derivatives. For example, the substitution of Leu by dGlu led to an improved complex stability of [111In]In- and [88Y]Y-DTPA-MG0 (DTPA-d-Glu-(GIu)5-Ala-Tyr-GlyTrp-Met-Asp Phe-NH2) [4]. Due to an observed elevated kidney accumulation, approaches to decrease this uptake by a reduction of the N-terminal D-glutamate chain as for MG11 (H-d-Glu-Ala-Tyr-Gly-Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2) \u2020Nadine Holzleitner and Thomas G\u00fcnther contributed equally to this work. *Correspondence: Thomas G\u00fcnther thomas.guenther@tum.de 1 Department of Chemistry, Technical University of Munich, 85748 Garching, Germany 2 Nuclear Medicine, University Hospital Augsburg, 86156 Augsburg, Germany\n[5, 6], or the substitution of the six L- by six D-glutamate moieties as for CP04 (DOTA-(d-Glu)6-Ala-Tyr-Gly-TrpMet-Asp-Phe-NH2) [7, 8] were performed.\nHowever, one major drawback of minigastrin analogs with regard to a clinical use was their low in\u00a0vivo stability. Therefore, Ocak et\u00a0 al. performed comparative stability studies in\u00a0vitro as well as in\u00a0vivo of various CCK-2R-targeted peptides, including MG11 and CP04. In the course of these experiments, the Asp-Phe, Gly-Trp and Tyr-Gly sequences were identified as the major cleavage sites of minigastrin analogs [8, 9].\nIn 2018, Klingler et\u00a0 al. reported that the substitution of Phe by 1-Nal and Met by (N-Me)Nle (Nle: norleucine) in MG11 led to an increased metabolic stability of the resulting compound (DOTA-MGS5) while high CCK-2R affinity was maintained [10]. Furthermore, [68\u00a0 Ga]Ga-DOTA-MGS5 revealed high activity levels in the tumor (23.3 \u00b1 4.7%ID/g), while displaying low activity uptake in the kidneys (5.7 \u00b1 1.4%ID/g) at 1\u00a0 h p.i. in A431-CCK-2R tumor-bearing nude mice [11, 12]. Further studies on substituting either Ala, Tyr or Gly in DOTA-MGS5 by Pro residues resulted in highly CCK2R-affine peptides with improved metabolic stability. Especially DOTA-MGS8 (DOTA-d-Glu-Pro-Tyr-GlyTrp-(N-Me)Nle-Asp-1-Nal-NH2) led to improved activity levels in the tumor and thus, tumor/background ratios as compared to DOTA-MGS5 [13\u201315].\nAnother strategy to stabilize CCK-2R-targeted compounds was attempted by a systematic substitution of peptide bonds by 1,4-disubstituted 1,2,3-triazoles in DOTA-[Nle15]MG11 (DOTA-d-Glu-Ala-Tyr-Gly-TrpNle-Asp-Phe-NH2) and DOTA-PP-F11N (DOTA-(dGlu)6-Ala-Tyr-Gly-Trp-Nle-Asp-Phe-NH2). Only a minor impact on CCK-2R affinity was observed for peptides comprising a triazole bond between the d-Glu-Pro, ProTyr, Tyr-Gly and Gly-Trp sequence. However, increased metabolic stability was only observed for compounds that comprise triazole bonds between Trp-Nle, NleAsp or Asp-Phe, which led to a loss in CCK-2R affinity, though. Therefore, no noticeable benefit on tumor accumulation was observed [16, 17].\nConsidering the above-mentioned studies, a high tolerance toward modifications within minigastrin analogs with regard to CCK-2R affinity was observed, especially when the N-terminal sequence (d-Glu-Ala-Tyr-Gly) was addressed [10, 13, 16, 17]. Indeed, substitution of \u03b1- by \u03b3-linked d-glutamate moieties within DOTA-PP-F11N had a beneficial impact on CCK-2R affinity [18]. Due to this high tolerability toward modifications at the N-terminus, one aim of this study was to provide a better insight on the structure\u2013activity relationship of minigastrin analogs at this part. Therefore, we carried out a glycine scan to elucidate the influence of the d-\u03b3-Glu-Ala-Tyr-Gly\nsequence in DOTA-\u03b3-MGS5 (DOTA-D-\u03b3-Glu-Ala-TyrGly-Trp-(N-Me)Nle-Asp-1-Nal-NH2) on CCK-2R affinity and if a simple polyethylene glycol (PEG) spacer can retain high CCK-2R affinity and concurrently improve metabolic stability (Fig.\u00a0 1). Furthermore, it was investigated whether the C-terminal tetrapeptide is sufficient for high CCK-2R affinity and which impact small modifications within this tetrapeptide unit have on affinity."

            "text": "Over the years, the effect of various modifications in minigastrin analogs on CCK-2R affinity and in\u00a0vivo stability was investigated. Especially the N-terminal amino acids d-Glu, Ala, Tyr and Gly were substituted by different building blocks, such as proline moieties (Klingler et\u00a0al.) or triazole bonds (Grob et\u00a0al.), which did not result in a major loss in CCK-2R affinity [13, 16, 17]. As we wanted to examine whether the presence of all of these four amino acids (d-Glu, Ala, Tyr and Gly) is crucial for high CCK-2R affinity, one aim of this study was to systematically substitute said amino acids by glycine to elucidate the structure\u2013activity relationship of these amino acids within minigastrin analogs. As recently published data by our group suggested a beneficial impact of \u03b3- instead of \u03b1-linked D-glutamate moieties on CCK-2R affinity [18], we carried out our studies on the peptide DOTA-\u03b3-MGS5 (DOTA- d-\u03b3-Glu-Ala-TyrGly-Trp-(N-Me)Nle-Asp-1-Nal-NH2). Furthermore, we wanted to investigate whether the C-terminal tetrapeptide (H-Trp-(N-Me)Nle-Asp-1-Nal-NH2) might be sufficient for high CCK-2R affinity.\nThe glycine scan revealed that D-\u03b3-Glu, Ala and Tyr each can be substituted by a Gly, without causing a major loss in CCK-2R affinity (IC50 = 4.2\u20139.7\u00a0 nM), in comparison to the references [natLu]Lu-DOTA-MGS5 (IC50 = 5.2 \u00b1 0.8\u00a0 nM) and [natLu]Lu-DOTA-\u03b3-MGS5 (IC50 = 4.9 \u00b1 0.8\u00a0nM). Therefore, it can be concluded that these three amino acids are not necessary for high CCK2R affinity, as each could be easily replaced by a glycine residue. Similar observations were made by SilventePoirot et\u00a0 al. when successively substituting each amino acid in CCK2\u20139 (H-Asp-Tyr-Met-Gly-Trp-Met-Asp-PheNH2) by an alanine residue, which exhibited only slight loss of CCK-2R affinity for the substitution of the N-terminal amino acids, while substitution of the four C-terminal amino acids resulted in low CCK-2R affinity [22]. These data accompany previously reported data on modifications at the N-terminal part of minigastrin analogs, as it could be demonstrated that the tolerability toward substitutions is high [14, 17, 18]. However, it could be shown that the presence of these amino acids is required with regard to the distance of the DOTA chelator to the pharmacophore, as [natLu]Lu-DOTA-CCK-62 (DOTA-GlyTrp-(N-Me)Nle-Asp-1-Nal-NH2, IC50 = 98.9 \u00b1 8.4\u00a0 nM) revealed a significant loss in CCK-2R affinity (p < 0.0001).\nHence, a spacer unit between the binding motif and the chelator moiety is necessary, in order to retain high CCK2R binding. Nevertheless, it is legitimate to question whether the pharmacophore consists of only four instead of seven amino acids, as the three N-terminal amino acids could be replaced by glycine residues, which are usually not linked to a pharmacological effect. This is supported by Silvente-Poirot et\u00a0al. who showed high CCK-2R affinity for the H-Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2 fragment [22]. In order to further examine this assumption, we substituted D-\u03b3-Glu-Ala-Tyr-Gly in DOTA-\u03b3-MGS5 by a (PEG)4 as well as a (PEG)3 spacer, which resulted in slightly less (compared to the references) yet still highly CCK-2R-affine minigastrin analogs ([natLu]Lu-DOTACCK-63: IC50 = 8.8 \u00b1 1.3\u00a0 nM, [natLu]Lu-DOTA-CCK-64: IC50 = 7.6 \u00b1 0.9\u00a0nM). The loss of affinity can be attributed to the lack of negative charges within the linker section, as it was shown that the CCK-2R comprises a high\nnumber of positively charged residues in the region that interacts with the linker section of its ligands, which is why negatively charged moieties at the N-terminus usually lead to increased CCK-2R affinity [23]. Supported by our results, we strongly suggest that the pharmacophore of minigastrin analogs indeed consists of only four amino acids, while the remaining N-terminal amino acids such as d-\u03b3-Glu or D-Glu, Ala, Tyr and Gly can be mainly considered a spacer for the (DOTA) chelator.\nWith the replacement of four N-terminal amino acids (of which three are L-amino acids) by an unnatural PEG chain, we aimed to improve metabolic stability of minigastrin analogs, as this should hamper their enzymatic cleavage at two major cleavage sites reported in the literature (Tyr-Gly and Gly-Trp) [8]. However, while high in\u00a0 vitro stability was observed in human serum for the reference, [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-\u03b3-MGS5, as well as [177Lu] Lu-DOTA-CCK-55 (-(Gly)3-) and -62 (-Gly-), a distinctly lower stability was determined for [177Lu]Lu-DOTACCK-63 (-(PEG)4-) and -64 (-(PEG)3-), which was surprising, given the robustness of a PEG chain and its usually positive impact on stability [24\u201327] and the susceptibility of L-amino acids toward in\u00a0 vitro and in\u00a0 vivo\ndegradation. An experimental error can be excluded, as all compounds were incubated (in separate vials) at the same time using the same batch of human serum. The respective metabolites observed for the two PEG-comprising compounds could not be identified, which is why further studies have to be carried out to elucidate the reason for this unexpected observation and to find a strategy to increase metabolic stability of such PEG-containing minigastrin derivatives.\nNevertheless, to further prove that a tetrapeptide motif is sufficient for high CCK-2R affinity, we determined the IC50 values of various tetrapeptides based on the C-terminus of DOTA-(\u03b3-)MGS5, which confirmed our assumption, as the peptides B3 (H-Trp-(N-Me)NleAsp-1-Nal-NH2), B4 (H-Trp-(N-Me)Nle-Asp-Phe-NH2) and B6 (H-Trp-(N-Me)Nle-Asp-Tyr-NH2) exhibited CCK-2R affinities in the low nanomolar range. Moreover, it could be demonstrated that the C-terminal position tolerates various aromatic residues, such as phenylalanine, L-1-naphtylalanine and tyrosine but not L-2-naphtylalanine or tryptophan. This observation confirmed that there is some tolerability at the C-terminus despite options for modifications within the pharmacophore are usually scarce, as even small changes can cause a distinct loss of affinity. Interestingly, when we extended our tetrapeptide analysis to DOTA-PP-F11N, a minigastrin analog currently tested in clinical trials [28], we found that the respective tetrapeptide (H-Trp-Nle-Asp-Phe-NH2) revealed a noticeably decreased CCK-2R affinity, while this sequence in combination with a linker sequence, such as (d-Glu)6-Ala-Tyr-Gly showed high affinity [18, 29]. This was surprising, as Silvente-Poirot et\u00a0al. reported high CCK-2R affinity for the tetrapeptide H-Trp-MetAsp-Phe-NH2 [22].\nAs the tetrapeptide B1 (H-Trp-Nle-Asp-1-Nal-NH2) also displayed low CCK-2R affinity, we suspected that N-methylation at the Nle moiety is crucial for high CCK2R affinity of Nle-comprising tetrapeptides. In fact, B1 containing a Nle moiety displayed a 50-fold higher IC50 value than B3 comprising an N-methylated Nle moiety, while the remaining sequence was identical. We thus conclude that a tetrapeptide motif at the C-terminus of minigastrin derivatives can be sufficient when containing a Nle moiety but seems to require an N-methylated peptide backbone at the Nle site, which is the most substantial finding of this work. We are aware that Silvente-Poirot et\u00a0 al. showed high CCK-2R affinity for the tetrapeptide H-Trp-Met-Asp-Phe-NH2, which does not contain any N-methylation [22]. However, as Met is usually replaced by a Nle moiety due to its susceptibility toward in\u00a0vivo oxidation and thus in\u00a0vivo degradation, we\nbelieve that our results could affect the future design of CCK-2R-targeted compounds.\nNot surprisingly, logD7.4 values confirmed the positive impact of a negatively charged D-\u03b3-Glu moiety on lipophilicity. [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-CCK-63 and -64, comprising either a (PEG)4 or (PEG)3 spacer instead of d-\u03b3-Glu-AlaTyr-Gly, still revealed comparable logD7.4 values to those of the references [177Lu]Lu-DOTA-MGS5 and [177Lu] Lu-DOTA-\u03b3-MGS5 (\u2212\u00a02.13 \u00b1 0.05 and \u2212\u00a02.21 \u00b1 0.07 versus \u2212\u00a0 2.21 \u00b1 0.08 and \u2212\u00a0 2.24 \u00b1 0.04, respectively), which suggests a positive impact of the PEG spacer on lipophilicity."

            "text": "We could confirm that the amino acid sequence d-\u03b3Glu-Ala-Tyr-Gly of minigastrin analogs is not required for high CCK-2R affinity but can be rather considered a spacer. Hence, substitution by PEG spacers simplified the peptide structure while maintaining high CCK-2R affinity and sufficient lipophilicity. In addition, we could confirm that only the tetrapeptide amino acid sequence H-Trp-(N-Me)Nle-Asp-1-Nal-NH2 in DOTA-MGS5 is required for high CCK-2R affinity, yet the presence of a tiny N-methyl group at the peptide backbone of the Nle moiety is crucial, which could affect future design of CCK-2R-targeted compounds. However, our initial rationale that substitution of the N-terminal L-amino acids Ala-Tyr-Gly by unnatural PEG chains would increase metabolic stability could not be confirmed. This unexpected finding has to be further investigated in future studies, particularly whether the introduction of additional moieties in these PEG-containing minigastrin analogs could improve metabolic stability while maintaining the beneficial aspects of PEGylation observed in this study.\nAbbreviations CCK\u20112R Cholecystokinin\u20112 receptor CP04 DOTA\u2011(d\u2011Glu)6\u2011Ala\u2011Tyr\u2011Gly\u2011Trp\u2011Met\u2011Asp\u2011Phe\u2011NH2 DOTA 1,4,7,10\u2011Tetraazacyclododecan\u20111,4,7,10\u2011tetracetic acid DOTA\u2011MGS5 DOTA\u2011d\u2011Glu\u2011Ala\u2011Tyr\u2011Gly\u2011Trp\u2011(N\u2011Me)Nle\u2011Asp\u20111\u2011Nal\u2011NH2 DOTA\u2011MGS8 DOTA\u2011 d\u2011Glu\u2011Pro\u2011Tyr\u2011Gly\u2011Trp\u2011(N\u2011Me)Nle\u2011Asp\u20111\u2011Nal\u2011NH2 DOTA\u2011[Nle15]MG11 DOTA\u2011 d\u2011Glu\u2011Ala\u2011Tyr\u2011Gly\u2011Trp\u2011Nle\u2011Asp\u2011Phe\u2011NH2 DOTA\u2011PP\u2011F11N DOTA\u2011(d\u2011Glu)6\u2011Ala\u2011Tyr\u2011Gly\u2011Trp\u2011Nle\u2011Asp\u2011Phe\u2011NH2 DTPA Diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid DTPA\u2011MG0 DTPA\u2011 d\u2011Glu\u2011(GIu)5\u2011Ala\u2011Tyr\u2011Gly\u2011Trp\u2011Met\u2011Asp\u2011Phe\u2011NH2 ESI\u2013MS Electro\u2011spray ionization mass spectrometry Fmoc 9\u2011Fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl MG11 H\u2011d\u2011Glu\u2011Ala\u2011Tyr\u2011Gly\u2011Trp\u2011Met\u2011Asp\u2011Phe\u2011NH2 MTC Medullary thyroid carcinoma PEG Polyethylene glycol radio\u2011TLC Radio\u2011thin layer chromatography RCP Radiochemical purity RCY Radiochemical yield RP\u2011HPLC Reversed\u2011phase high performance liquid chromatography SPPS Solid\u2011phase peptide synthesis\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1186/ s13550\u2011 023\u2011 01016\u2011y.\nAdditional file\u00a01.
