    "abstractText": "The catalytic upgrading of ethanol into butanol through the Guerbet coupling reaction has received increasing attention recently due to the sufficient supply of bioethanol and the versatile applications of butanol. In this work, four different supported Cu catalysts, i.e., Cu/Al2O3, Cu/NiO, Cu/Ni3AlOx, and Cu/Ni1AlOx (Ni2+/Al3+ molar ratios of 3 and 1), were applied to investigate the catalytic performances for ethanol conversion. From the results, Ni-containing catalysts exhibit better reactivity; Al-containing catalysts exhibit better stability; but in terms of ethanol conversion, butanol selectivity, and catalyst stability, a corporative effect between Ni\u2013Al catalytic systems can be clearly observed. Combined characterizations such as XRD, TEM, XPS, H2-TPR, and CO2/NH3-TPD were applied to analyze the properties of different catalysts. Based on the results, Cu species provide the active sites for ethanol dehydrogenation/hydrogenation, and the support derived from Ni\u2013Al\u2013LDH supplies appropriate acid\u2013base sites for the aldol condensation, contributing to the high butanol selectivity. In addition, catalysts with strong reducibility (i.e., Cu/NiO) may be easily deconstructed during catalysis, leading to fast deactivation of the catalysts in the Guerbet coupling process.",

            "text": "Butanol is an important chemical feedstock that can be used as an organic solvent, chemical intermediate, and extractant in the cosmetics and pharmaceutical industries [1\u20133]. It is also one of the most promising alternatives to ethanol as a blending component of gasoline to improve fuel quality and reduce the emission of harmful gases [4\u20136]. Except for the well-established commercial technologies for the synthesis of butanol, including the oxo process (hydroformylation of propylene with syngas) [7] and the ABE process (fermentation of sugar-containing crops) [8], the catalytic upgrading of bioethanol to n-butanol is highly attractive due to the sufficient supply of bioethanol from renewable biomass [9\u201312]. Generally, there are two accepted pathways for ethanol conversion to n-butanol, i.e., the direct coupling reaction of two ethanol molecules via dimerization to form n-butanol [13,14], and the Guerbet coupling process via multi-step tandem reactions with acetaldehyde and crotonaldehyde as intermediates (see Scheme 1) [15\u201318]. In the direct route, the \u03b2-H of the ethanol molecule is activated and reacted with another ethanol molecule through dehydration (Scheme 1a), which has been reported on solid-base catalysts or alkali cation zeolites [19,20]. But in the Guerbet coupling process, the C\u2013C formation is accomplished by the aldol condensation route, consisting of dehydrogenation of ethanol, aldol condensation of acetaldehyde molecules, and subsequent hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to form butanol (Scheme 1b) [14,17]. This reaction has been known for more than 100 years,\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5683. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28155683 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5683 2 of 13\nand the dehydrogenation coupling of ethanol into n-butanol via C\u2013C addition was first investigated by Guerbet over sodium alkoxide [21]. Inspired by the work, the coupling of ethanol into higher alcohols through the Guerbet coupling process via either homogeneous or heterogeneous catalysts has been reported by many researchers [22\u201328].\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 13\naldol condensation of acetaldehyde molecules, and subsequent hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde to form butanol (Scheme 1b) [14,17]. This reaction has been known for more than 100 years, and the dehydrogenation coupling of ethanol into n-butanol via C\u2013C addition was first investigated by Guerbet over sodium alkoxide [21]. Inspired by the work, the coupling of ethanol into higher alcohols through the Guerb t c upling process via ither homogeneous r heterogeneous catalysts has been eported by many researcher [22\u201328].\nScheme 1. (a) The direct route and (b) Guerbet coupling process for ethanol transformation to butanol.\nIn homogeneous catalytic systems, high selectivity can be obtained by using iridium [29], ruthenium [30], and manganese [31] complexes as catalysts, accompanied by sodium ethoxide or strong bases. Whereas, although high conversions and selectivity have been obtained, great issues such as product purification, catalyst recovery, and waste treatment have become the main obstacles for industrial applications. The use of heterogeneous catalytic systems has been reported to be an alternative way to deal with the aforementioned problems [24\u201328]. But in heterogeneous systems, it is more challenging to synthesize butanol from ethanol because of the competitive side reactions such as ethanol dehydration to ethylene, ethanol dehydrogenative dimerization to ethyl acetate, and the Lebedev reaction to 1,3-butadiene [10,32]. Mixed metal oxides supported by transition metals are usually reported as efficient catalysts for the Guerbet coupling process [32\u201340], in which mixed metal oxides derive from layered double hydroxides (LDH). For example, MgAlOx obtained by the thermal decomposition of Mg\u2013Al\u2013LDH is one of the most common supports for ethanol conversion to butanol [32\u201334]. A great number of Mg\u2013Al\u2013LDH-derived metal catalysts were designed and developed for this reaction [37\u201339]. For instance, G. W. Huber et al. investigated Mg\u2013Al mixed oxide-supported Cu catalysts for the Guerbet coupling process [32]. They found that catalysts with low Cu loadings (0.1~0.6 wt.%) have high selectivity to C4+ alcohols (49~63%), whereas catalysts with high Cu loadings (>1.2 wt.%) are selective to esters and ketones. Zhang et al. prepared MgAlOx-supported Ru catalysts for ethanol conversion [33]. They discovered that the atomic Ru can promote ethanol dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde and the aldol condensation of acetaldehyde by adjusting the Ru dispersion and the acid\u2013base properties [33]. Besides, Mg\u2013Al mixed oxides supported by Pd [37], Ag [39], and Ni [40] catalysts are also synthesized and evaluated for ethanol coupling to butanol. However, the utilization of noble metal catalysts increases the final cost of the whole process. Thus, non-noble metal catalysts based on Ni and/or Cu are usually preferred. Our group previously found that the non-noble metal Cu catalyst derived from Ni\u2013 Al\u2013LDH (Cu/NiAlOx) exhibits good performance in ethanol conversion [36]. The Cu species with appropriate contents (>0.75 wt.%) was found to make a big difference in the catalytic performances. However, it is still ambiguous about the function of support for the reaction pathway. In fact, the support effect altered the properties of catalysts and impacted the catalytic performance during the conversion of ethanol [41,42]. Thus, in this\nOH + OH OHDimerizationa.\nb.

(a) The direct route and (b) Guerbet coupling process for ethanol t ansformation to butanol.\nI c talytic systems, high s lectivity can be obtained by using iridium [29], ruthenium [30], and manganese [31] complexes as cat lysts, ccompanied by sodium ethoxide or strong bas s. Whereas, although high conver ions and selectivity have b en obt ined, great issues such as product purification, atalyst recovery, and waste treatm nt have become the main bstacles for industrial applications. Th us of heterogeneous catalytic systems has been reported to be an alternative way to deal with the aforementioned problems [24\u201328]. But in heterogeneous systems, it is more challenging to synthesize butanol from ethanol because of the competitive side reactions such as ethanol dehydration to ethylene, ethanol dehydrogenative dimerization to ethyl acetate, and the Lebedev reaction to 1,3-butadiene [10,32]. ixed etal oxides supported by transition etals are usually reported as efficient catalysts for the Guerbet coupling process [32\u201340], in which ixed etal oxides derive from layered double hydroxides (LDH). For example, MgAlOx obtained by the thermal decomposition of Mg\u2013Al\u2013LDH is one of the most common supports for ethanol conversion to butanol [32\u201334]. A great number of Mg\u2013Al\u2013LDH-derived metal catalysts were designed and developed for this reaction [37\u201339]. For instance, G. W. Huber et al. investigated Mg\u2013Al mixed oxide-supported Cu catalysts for the Guerbet coupling process [32]. They found that catalysts with low Cu loadings (0.1~0.6 wt.%) have high selectivity to C4+ alcohols (49~63%), whereas catalysts with high Cu loadings (>1.2 wt.%) are selective to esters and ketones. Zhang et al. prepared MgAlOx-supported Ru catalysts for ethanol conversion [33]. They discovered that the atomic Ru can promote ethanol dehydrogenation to acetaldehyde and the aldol condensation of acetaldehyde by adjusting the Ru dispersion and the acid\u2013base properties [33]. Besides, Mg\u2013Al mixed oxides supported by Pd [37], Ag [39], and Ni [40] catalysts are also synthesized and evaluated for ethanol coupling to butanol. However, the utilization of noble metal catalysts increases the final cost of the whole process. Thus, non-noble metal catalysts based on Ni and/or Cu are usually preferred. Our group previously found that the non-noble metal Cu catalyst derived from Ni\u2013Al\u2013LDH (Cu/NiAlOx) exhibits good performance in ethanol conversion [36]. The Cu species with appropriate contents (>0.75 wt.%) was found to make a big difference in the catalytic performances. However, it is still ambiguous about the function of support for the reaction pathway. In fact, the support effect altered the properties of catalysts and impacted the catalytic performance during the conversion of ethanol [41,42]. Thus, in this work, to clarify the effect of support on ethanol conversion, four different supported copper catalysts (i.e., Cu/Al2O3, Cu/NiO, Cu/Ni3AlOx, and Cu/Ni1AlOx) were designed and prepared for the synthesis of n-butanol through the Guerbet coupling process. By adjusting the composition of the supports, the structure and properties of the catalysts were investigated\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5683 3 of 13\nin detail using X-ray powder diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR), and temperature-programmed desorption (TPD) of CO2/NH3. Based on these results, insights into the reasons for different catalytic performances and stabilities are revealed. We believe this work will provide good guidance for understanding the role of support and help to develop efficient catalysts with multiple functional sites for the Guerbet coupling process."

The corresponding results are summarized in Table 1. From the results, the samples with high Ni content, i.e., Cu/Ni3AlOx (Table 1, Entry 1) and Cu/NiO (Table 1, Entry 3), show high reactivity in the reaction, with an ethanol conversion of ~40%. While the samples with a high Al content, i.e., Cu/Ni1AlOx (Table 1, Entry 2) and Cu/Al2O3 (Table 1, Entry 4), show lower reactivity with an ethanol conversion of ~30%. Notably, for the synthesis of butanol, Cu/Ni3AlOx and Cu/Ni1AlOx exhibit higher selectivity when compared with Cu/NiO and Cu/Al2O3, with values of 41.3% and 43.8%, respectively. In addition, higher alcohols such as hexanol were detected as the main byproduct, with selectivities of 8.7% and 11.4%, indicating the carbon chain growth via aldol condensation reaction is much easier on the Ni\u2013Al catalytic systems. For the Cu/NiO, the ethanol conversion is relatively high (41.1%), but the butanol selectivity (37.0%) is not as high as that of the Cu/Ni3AlOx and Cu/Ni1AlOx, indicating Al species have a positive effect on the synthesis of butanol. However, a pure Al2O3-supported Cu catalyst is not selective for obtaining butanol, with a selectivity of 24.1%, which agrees well with the previous literature since ethanol dehydration would happen over the Cu/Al2O3 catalyst to form ether and/or ethyl acetate due to the presence of a large number of acid sites [42,43].\nReaction conditions: catalyst: 2 g, temperature: 523 K, pressure of N2: 2 MPa, gas hourly space velocity (GHSV): 692 h\u22121, liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV): 4.8 h\u22121. a Conversion and selectivity were calculated by the results of average values within 48 h detected by gas chromatography."

Herein, based on NH3-TPD measurements (Figure 5b), all catalysts possess a certain degree of acid sites, whereas Cu/Al2O3 exhibits the most amount of NH3 desorption, which is highly relevant to the phase of AlOOH [51]. According to our previous results (Table 1), Cu/Al2O3 shows the lowest butanol selectivity (24.1%). Meanwhile, a large amount of ethyl acetate (19.7%) was produced during catalysis. This phenomenon is attributed to the weak basicity and strong acidity of Cu/Al2O3 [42,43]. In comparison, Cu/NiO exhibits better performance with higher ethanol conversion (41.1%) and butanol selectivity (37%), compared to Cu/Al2O3. We deduced that the small amount of basic and acidic sites might form acid\u2013base pairs to promote acetaldehyde condensation and generate more of the target product butanol [52]. Noteworthy, Cu/Ni3AlOx and Cu/Ni1AlOx catalysts derived from Ni\u2013Al\u2013LDH optimized the acid\u2013base distributions and modified the balance of acid\u2013base sites, favoring aldol condensation and obtaining the highest amount of butanol [36,46]. Except for acid\u2013base sites, metal-active sites such as Cu and/or Ni were essential for the Guerbet coupling process, which involved the dehydrogenation of ethanol and the hydrogenation of crotonaldehyde [35,36]. From the previous results, part of CuO and NiO can be reduced to metallic Cu and metallic Ni (Figure 2), thus providing sufficient amounts of active sites for hydrogen transfer. In view of the catalytic performance and catalyst stability, Ni-containing samples afford better reactivity, and Al-containing samples afford better stability (Table 1 and Figure 1). Based on XRD (Figure 2) and HRTEM (Figure 4) results, Al-containing samples are more stable during catalysis when compared with Nicontaining samples because Al species can prevent the agglomeration of metal particles and benefit the stabilization of active Cu species (Figures 2b and 4d). In considering\nMolecules 2023, 28, 5683 8 of 13\nthe reducing atmosphere of ethanol conversion, the reducibility of the above catalysts was further evaluated by hydrogen temperature-programmed reduction (H2-TPR). As displayed in Figure 6, a wide and broad band in the range of 300~800 \u25e6C can be observed over the Ni-containing samples, which is assigned to the reduction peak of Ni2+ [36,40]. Whereas compared with Cu/Ni3AlOx and Cu/Ni1AlOx, the reduction peak of Cu/NiO shifted to a lower temperature, indicating Cu/NiO is more easily reduced under the H2 atmosphere. Hence, the facile reducibility of Cu/NiO would generate more metallic Ni and lead to relatively poor stability during catalysis. For the Cu/Al2O3, no reduction peak of support can be observed, agreeing well with its excellent stability. Besides, an obvious consumption peak at 120~250 \u25e6C can be observed on all catalysts, which is assigned to the reduction peak of CuO [35,36]. Considering the reaction temperature is 250 \u25e6C, most of the Cu2+ species can be reduced to low valence, thus producing active Cu0/Cu+ species for the dehydrogenation and hydrogenation processes of the Guerbet coupling process [36,45].\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 13 Cu/Al2O3 exhibits the most amount of NH3 desorption, which is highly relevant to the phase of AlOOH [51].

From Cu 2p XPS (Figure 7a,c), most of the Cu2+ species over the spent catalysts (Figure 7c) were reduced to Cu0 and Cu+, as the peak positioned at 934.7 eV greatly decreased, accompanied by the disappearance or weakening of satellite peaks [35,36]. This result is also consistent with XRD, HRTEM, and H2-TPR results. To be noted, when compared with Ni-containing samples, Cu2+ over the Cu/Al2O3 is relatively difficult to reduce to Cu+/Cu0, indicating Cu species loaded on Al2O3 are more stable, which is in accordance with our previous results. In terms of Ni species (Figure 7b,d), the reduction of Ni2+ (855.6 eV) to Ni0 (852.69 eV) is clearly observed in all catalysts (Figure 7d), but for the Cu/NiO, a new peak positioned at 854.2 eV appeared over the fresh catalyst (Figure 7c), which is assigned to the presence of Ni+ [53]. Hence, the Cu/NiO has stronger reducibility compared to Cu/Ni3AlOx and Cu/Ni1AlOx, which might lead to its poor stability during catalysis.

Typically, specific amounts of catalysts were placed in the middle of the reactor, and then the pressure of the system was increased and maintained with a back-pressure regulator. After purging with N2 for 30 min, the temperature was programmed to increase to the specific value with a heating rate of 5 \u25e6C/min. Then, ethanol was introduced by using a plunger pump (NP-KX-210) with a constant liquid hourly space velocity (LHSV). The reaction products were analyzed offline with an Agilent 7890B chromatograph equipped with an HP-5 capillary column (30 m \u00d7 0.32 mm) and a flame ionization detector (FID). O-xylene was used as an internal standard for the quantification of the liquid products. Products were identified with a GC\u2013MS from Agilent (Agilent 7890B-5977B MSD) with the same HP-5 column.

From the results, a corporative effect between Ni\u2013Al catalytic systems can be clearly observed in terms of ethanol conversion, butanol selectivity, and catalyst stability. The results from XRD and HRTEM indicated that the addition of Al might stabilize the active Cu species and prevent the agglomeration of metal particles, leading to its excellent stability in ethanol conversion. H2-TPR and XPS results implied that Ni-containing samples have strong reducibility, which might destroy the structure and lead to the deactivation of the catalyst. In addition, an appropriate balance of acid\u2013base sites was shown to make a large difference in product selectivity, favoring catalyzing aldol condensation and obtaining the product butanol, which can be proved by CO2/NH3-TPD results. Based on these findings, catalysts with multiple functional sites for the Guerbet coupling process need to be designed. We believe this work will provide good guidance for understanding the role of Ni and Al in supporting and helping to develop efficient catalysts for the ethanol conversion reaction.\nAuthor Contributions: Y.T. and Y.D. conceived the study; Y.X. performed most of the experiments; N.Z. and J.L. contributed to the characterizations.
