            "text": "Page 2/22\n1 Introduction Ulcerative colitis (UC) is a long-term condition which contributes to the in ammation and ulcers of the colon and rectum(Ford et al. 2013). It is de ned by the World Health Organization as one of the modern intractable diseases, which has developed into a global disease due to its appeated recurrence and longterm treatment(Kaplan 2015). Approximately 11.2\u00a0million people were affected as of 2015(Disease et al. 2016) and it often begins in young people aged 15 to 30 years(Ford et al. 2013). UC is mainly manifested by intestinal tissue in ammation, intestinal mucosal damage and intestinal barrier dysfunction(Wang et al. 2019). The patients may exhibit symptoms of bloody stools or abdominal pain. UC not only causes physical and psychological problems for patients but also increases the global economic burden. Ulcerative colitis can affect the mucosa and submucosa of the colon and rectum, and increase the microbes in lamina propria. Macrophages could send out in ammatory signals when they engulf the microbes and increase the expression of pro-in ammatory cytokines. As an idiopathic and chronic in ammatory disease, UC may be led by genetic factors, unhealthy lifestyle and gut microbiota. At present, many drugs are discovered to relieve colitis, such as corticosteroids, aminosalicylates and some biological regents which come with larger side effects(Ooi &Sands 1999). Relapse is common after treatment discontinuation, and there are many adverse reactions. Therefore, new therapeutic drugs with fewer side effects need to be developed(Wang et al. 2021).\nPortulaca oleracea L. (PO), also known as Purslane, belongs to the family Portulacaceae. It is a widely distributed traditional folk medicine with insect repellent, febrifuge and antiseptic effects. Its leaves are also frequently used in salad and cooked or baked in pies, soups and omelets in the Mediterranean diet. This edible property makes it become a kind of safe, non-toxic and promising medicinal plant resource for research and development. In 1990, the World Health Organization (WHO) listed PO as a global panacea. As an edible and medicinal plant, PO has a wide range of pharmacological effects, such as antimicrobial, bronchodilatory and anti-in ammatory(Boskabady et al. 2019). Recently, PO was reported to exert a protective effect on joint in ammation mice by suppressing the expression of Nrf2 and\nPage 3/22\nNLRP3(He et al. 2021). Additionally, it has been proved to reduce the in ammatory response in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) by suppressing the expression of pro-in ammatory cytokines(Kim et al. 2018).\nThe dried PO and fresh juice of PO may have different uses. In traditional Chinese medicine, the dried plants were decocted for plant extracts and prepared as Chinese herbal medicine pieces and used for the treatment of dysentery with bloody stools and hemorrhoid bleeding, and external application to reduce swellings, eczema, sores, erysipelas as well as snake- and insect-bite (Chen et al. 2009). While the juice of the plant can be used to alleviate the burning sensation. Leaf juice has been recommended to relieve in ammation of the male genitalia (Belcheff 2012). In Pakistan, fresh aboveground parts of PO are considered valuable in the treatment of urinary and digestive problems. It's worth mentioning that PO exerts excellent anti-in ammatory potential in the form of both Chinese herbal medicine pieces and fresh juice. However, the effect of PO on DSS-induced UC mice remains largely unde ned.\nPyroptosis is a highly in ammatory form of lytic programmed cell death(Rashidi et al. 2019). Different from apoptosis, pyroptosis is caspase-1 dependence, leading to DNA fragmentation and in ammatory factors release(Wu et al. 2016). It has been proved that pyroptosis of epithelial cells contributes to barrier dysfunction. In addition, tight barrier proteins can maintain the integrity of the intestinal barrier, reduce the possibility of bacterium and toxin invasion. Therefore, reducing the pyroptosis level in macrophages and remodeling the intestinal barrier can be an effective way to alleviate UC.\nTo promote the application of traditional Chinese medicine in UC treatment, we explored whether PO exerts therapeutic effects on DSS-induced UC in mice and elucidated its underlying molecular mechanisms. First, we compared the therapeutic effects of Portulaca oleracea L. juice (PJ) and Portulaca oleracea L. aqueous extract (POE) on ulcerative colitis in mice. Then, the anti-in ammatory and antipyroptosis effects of PJ were explored in DSS-induced ulcerative colitis mice. Moreover, the protein and mRNA expressions of the intestine barrier were performed to evaluate the intestinal barrier repair effect of PO.\n2 Materials And Methods 2.1 Chemicals and reagents\nMethanol and formic acid were purchased from Thermo Fisher. Deionized water was prepared using Milli Q Advantage A10 ultrapure water machine. Centrifuge tubes of sizes 1.5 mL and 15 mL and injection vials were purchased from Axygen. All other chemicals or reagents used are of analytical grade.\n2.2 Preparation of the Portulaca oleracea L.\nDried Portulaca oleracea L. was purchased from Tongrentang (Beijing). 100 g Portulaca oleracea L. were decocted twice with water for 30 min each time. Then, the extracts were mixed, boiled to 70\u00b0C and concentrated to 100 mL (1 g/mL).\nPage 4/22\nFresh Portulaca oleracea L. was collected in September 2020 from the Guangdong region (China). 100 g aerial parts of Fresh Portulaca oleracea L. were washed with water, cut into small pieces and blended with a Joyang juicer. The juice was collected from Portulaca oleracea L. puree by centrifugation (10,000\u00d7 g, 20 min, 4\u00b0C) and concentrated to 100 mL (1 g/mL). Then sterilized by ltration on 0.22 \u00b5m membrane lters.\n2.3 Analysis of the main bioactive components of POE and PJ\nChromatographic separation was performed on an ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 2.1\u00d7100mm, 1.8\u00b5m column. The column temperature was 35\u00b0C. The injection volume was 10 \u00b5L. The mobile phase contained (A) aqueous formic acid (0.1%, v/v) and (B) acetonitrile (containing 0.1% formic acid) at a ow rate of 0.3mL/min. The gradient elution was 0\u201330% B at 0\u201310 min, 30\u201340% B at 10\u201320 min, 40\u201350% B at 25\u2013 30 min, 50\u201370% B at 30\u201340 min, 70\u2013100% B at 40\u201345 min and the re-equilibration time of gradient elution was 15 minutes. Q Exactive Orbitrap high-resolution mass spectrometry was used for mass spectrometry data acquisition, and the detection mode was Full MS-ddMS2 with simultaneous scanning of positive and negative ion modes. The scan range was m/z 100\u20131200, MS1 resolution was set to 70000, and MS2 resolution was set to 17500. The ion source voltage was 3.2kV. Capillary temperature was 320\u00b0C and aux gas heater temperature was 350\u00b0C. Sheath gas ow rate was 40 L/min and aux gas ow rate was 15 L/min. AGC Target was set to 1e6, TopN was set to 5, and the collision energy for triggering MS2 scan was set to 30, 40, and 50 using a stepped fragmentation voltage NCE. The data were analyzed using Compound discoverer 3.3 software, and the compounds were structurally identi ed using local database and mzcloud online database.\n2.4 Network pharmacology analysis\nThe targets of PO were obtained from the Traditional Chinese Medicine Systems Pharmacology (TCMSP) (http://tcmspnw.com). The OMIM (https://omim.org/), Genecards (https://www.genecards.org/), and TTD (http://db.idrblab.net/ttd/) databases were used to identify UC-related genes. We established a set of UCassociated genes by uniting the search results.The STRING database (https://string-db.org/) was used to construct the protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) network. Targets of UC, PJ, POE, and common composition were imported into Cytoscape 3.9.0 to investigate the critical subnetwork. Based on the scores obtained by Cytoscape, we ltered the genes with scores above the median value and constructed a network using these genes. The CytoNCA plugin in Cytoscape was used to analyze the top 10 genes. All selected targets were entered into the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID, http://www.david.niaid.nig.gov), which could provide systematic annotations of pathways and biological processes.\n2.5 Animals\nKunming mice (male, 7\u20138 weeks old) were purchased from Speyford (Beijing) Experimental Animal Science and Technology Co. Ltd, Ltd. (Beijing, China) (Production license number was SCXK 2019-0010). The experimental protocols were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of China\nPage 5/22\nAgricultural University. All works were conducted according to the guidelines of the National Institute of Health (https://olaw.nih.gov/) for laboratory animal care and use.\n2.6 Modeling and grouping\nExperiment 1 After acclimatization for seven days, twenty-four mice (30\u201342 g) were randomly divided into four groups: control group, DSS group, POE group (1 g/kg), and PJ group (12 g/kg), with 6 mice per group. The details of the experiment including modeling and grouping were shown in Fig. 3A.\nExperiment 2 Thirty mice (30\u201342 g) were randomly divided into the control group, DSS group, PJ-H group (24 g/kg), PJ-M group (12 g/kg), PJ-L group (6 g/kg), with 6 mice per group. The details of the experiment including modeling and grouping were shown in Fig. 3A.\n5% DSS (DSS, M.W. 36000\u201350000; MP Biomedicals, UK) was dissolved in drinking water for 7 days to induce acute colitis(Shin et al. 2017). The mice in the POE group and PJ group were administered with POE or PJ for one week based on the conversion rate of clinical administration dose. Mice in DSS and controls were gavaged with the same volume of saline. On day 15, all mice were sacri ced and we collected the colon tissues for further analysis after measuring the lengths. Blood samples were collected and then centrifuged at 1500 g for 10 min to obtain serum. Assays were performed following standard procedures.\n2.7 Disease Activity Index Assessment\nThe body weight and stool condition of the mice were monitored to calculate the disease activity index (DAI). The DAI was scored by the well-established methods which were shown in Supplementary Table S1(Bang &Lichtenberger 2016).\n2.8 Histologic and AB-PAS staining\nThe colonic tissues were xed in Neutral buffered Formalin (10%) and stained with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E) and Alcian Blue Periodic acid Schiff (AB-PAS). The apoptosis in the colon was assessed by TUNEL staining (Boster, Wuhan, China). The digital images were captured using light microscopy (DS-Ri2, Nikon, Japan). The expression of colon mucin was calculated according to the mucin density, the apoptotic rate is the ratio of the apoptotic cells to the total cells, determined with image analysis using image-pro-plus.\n2.9 Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay\nOne hundred mg of colon tissues were homogenated into 900ul normal saline, then centrifugation at 3500 g for 15 min to obtain10% colon tissue homogenate. The levels of (IL)-1\u03b2 (ColorfulGene, Wuhan, Cat. No. JYM0543Mo), IL-18 (ColorfulGene, Wuhan, Cat. No. JYM0531Mo) in colons and serum samples were measured by corresponding ELISA kits following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions.\n2.10 Expression of in ammatory cytokines using antibody array membrane\nPage 6/22\nThe expression of in ammatory cytokine was evaluated by the array membrane following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. The protein was isolated from the colon samples with a total protein extraction kit (Solarbio, Beijing, China), then, the concentration of the supernatants was measured by BCA (Solarbio, Beijing, China) and the concentration was adjusted to 100 \u00b5g/mL. First, the membranes were placed in the 8-well tray and incubated with the blocking buffer for 30 min, then, the protein supernatants of each group were added to the membrane for 24 h at 4\u00b0C. The membranes were washed and incubated with biotin-conjugated anti-cytokines. Two hours later, the membranes were washed and horseradish peroxidase-conjugated streptavidin was added to each well for 2 h at room temperature. After washing, the expression of proteins was detected by enhanced chemiluminescence and visualized by Amersham ImageQuant 800 imaging system (Cytiva, USA, Japan). The measurements of each signal intensity were determined by ImageJ. Data were normalized to the positive control signals and the relative cytokine expression was determined.\n2.11 Immunohistochemistry (IHC)\nThe para n sections were incubated with 3% hydrogen peroxide to deactivate endogenous peroxidase. After 5% BSA blocking, the primary antibodies were added to the sections for 10 h at 4\u00b0C. The primary antibodies included ASC/TMS1 (1:100, Abcam), Caspase-1/p20/p10 (1:100, Origen), MUC-2 (1:1000), and Occludin (1:50). Then the sections were washed in TBS for three times and incubated with APconjugated anti-rabbit secondary antibody at 37\u00b0C. The images were selected using a light microscopy (DS-Ri2, Nikon, Japan). The results were quanti ed by Image-Pro Plus 6.0 software.\n2.12 Quantitative Real-Time PCR Analysis\nTotal RNA was extracted from colon tissues using an RNA extraction kit (Promega, China) followed by reverse transcription with GoScript\u2122 Reverse Transcription System (Promega, USA). Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) was performed for quantitative analysis of the genes. Primers of the related genes were listed in Table 1. The relative expression of the target genes was calculated by the 2\u2212\u0394\u0394CTmethod.\u00a0\n\u00a0\nPage 7/22\nGene Primer sequence (5\u2032\u20133\u2032) GenBank accession no\nPCR product Tm(\u2103)\nPCR product GC%\nProduct size (bp)\nTable 1 Primers and probes for qPCR\nCasp-1 F: ACTCGTACACGTCTTGCCCTCA\nR: CTGGGCAGGCAGCAAATTC\nNM_009807.2 76.2 47.4 190\nAsc F: CTGAGCAGCTGCAAACGACTAAAG\nR: TGCAAAGCATCCAGCACTCC\nNM_023258.4 79.0 55.6 160\nNlrp3 F: ACTGAAGCACCTGCTCTGCAAC\nR: AACCAATGCGAGATCCTGACAAC\nNM_001359638.1 75.0 53.4 88\nGsdmd F: CGTTATTCATGTGTCAACCTGTCAA\nR: TCCCATCGACGACATCAGAGA\nNM_026960.4 75.1 50.5 109\nMuc-2 F: GCTGCACCAAGAACATCTCCA\nR: TTCCAGGGTAACACTTCGGACAC\nNM_023566.3 77.5 53.1 143\nOcln F: GGCAAGCGATCATACCCAGAG\nR: AGGCTGCCTGAAGTCATCCAC\nNM_001360536.1 75.7 52.4 105\nGapdh F: TGTGTCCGTCGTGGATCTGA\nR: TTGCTGTTGAAGTCGCAGGAG\nNM_001289726 78.6 55.3 150\n2.13 Statistical Analysis All data were presented as the means \u00b1 standard deviation (SD), one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to analyze the results. Multiple comparisons were performed with Dunnett\u2019s t test-post-hoc analysis test, and p < 0.05 was considered statistically signi cant. The statistical analysis was performed by SPSS 26.0 (SPSS Inc., NY, United States).\n3 Results 3.1 Major components of Portulaca oleracea L. by HPLC-MS/MS\nIn order to identify the major components of POE and PJ, we used HPLC-MS/MS for the component analysis. A total of 155 components from POE and PJ were identi ed (Fig. 1). PJ and POE have 63 identical components including 14 organic acids, 1 phenol, 2 avonoids, 2 alkaloids, etc., and 35 other\nPage 8/22\nsubstances that are mainly amino acids and plant metabolites. Thirty-nine unique components were identi ed from POE, containing 7 organic acids, 6 avonoids and 4 terpenoids. We also identi ed 51 unique components including 6 organic acids, 6 avonoids, 11 terpenoids and 2 coumarins.\n3.2 Network Pharmacology Predicts the Effect of Portulaca oleracea L. on Ulcerative Colitis\nTo explore potential pharmacological targets and mechanisms of PO involved in UC, we performed network pharmacology analysis on PJ, POE, and common compositions mentioned above. The overlapping targets of UC with common compositions, POE and PJ were 47, 48 and 74, respectively. To further reveal the drug-disease-pathway connections, we built a PPI network, in which the overlapping targets were imported and GO and KEGG enrichment analyses were performed. The PPI network revealed that PJ and POE could both act therapeutic effects through targets including MAPK14, PPARG, and ESR1. GO and KEGG results suggested that POE and PJ could treat UC through pathways associated with platelet activation as well as lipid and atheroscierosis (Fig. 2A). Among the overlapping targets of POE and UC, the targets with higher node degrees contained TP53, IL-6, and CAT. The PI3K-Akt signaling pathway and TNF signaling pathway may be the key pathways in POE for treating ulcerative colitis (Fig. 2B). We also found that IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TP53, and PTGS2 could be the more important targets of the PJ and UC overlapping targets. In addition to cancer-related pathways, receptor activation and reactive oxygen species accumulation are also relevant and important pathways (Fig. 2C). We therefore hypothesized that PO may improve the degree of in ammation and symptoms of UC by modulating in ammatory factors and antioxidant systems.\n3.3 Portulaca oleracea L. Improved the Symptoms and Reduced the Colon Injury of DSS-Induced Colitis in Mice\nThe effects of PO on UC were evaluated through the UC mice induced by 5% DSS solution for 7 days (Fig. 3A). Compared with DSS group, POE (1 g/kg) or PJ (12 g/kg) treatment signi cantly improved the body weights of DSS mice (P < 0.01), reduced the DAI scores (P < 0.01) and increased the colon length (P < 0.01) (Fig. 3B-D).\nTo further explore the effects of POE and PJ on DSS mice, we accessed the pathological changes in colon tissue. DSS could lead to severe colonic damage including erosion of lamina propria mucosa, decreasing of glandular cells, and in ltration of numerous neutrophils. Administrate with POE and PJ dramatically decreased the pathological changes and HE scores. In addition, PO could signi cantly reduce the apoptosis in colon tissue (Fig. 3E). These results con rmed the therapeutic effect of POE and PJ on DSSinduced mice, while PJ had a better effect compared with POE (P < 0.01).\n3.4 PJ Suppressed DSS-Induced Expression of In ammatory Responses in Colon\nThe expression of pro-in ammatory cytokines in colon tissues was detected using an antibody array membrane. DSS-induced signi cantly increased the concentrations of BLC (P < 0.01), IL-1\u03b1 (P < 0.01),\nPage 9/22\nTNF-\u03b1 (P < 0.01), IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, and INF-\u03b3. However, these cytokines were markedly decreased after treatment with PJ. The cytokines which were especially affected by DSS and PJ were expressed as fold change (Fig. 4C).\n3.5 PJ attenuates clinical colitis parameters in DSS-induced UC mice\nThe effects of different dose of PJ on DSS-induced UC mice were evaluated (Fig. 5A). In the DSS group, the colonic length was signi cantly shortened compared with that of the other groups, and diarrhea and weight loss were notably worsened; thus, the DAI rose sharply at days 3, 6 and 9 (P < 0.05). PJ (12 g/kg) treatment signi cantly improved the body weights of DSS mice (P < 0.01), reduced the DAI scores (P < 0.01) and increased the colon length (P < 0.01) (Fig. 5B-D).The medium dose of PJ had the best therapeutic effect, with no remarkable difference compared to the control group. HE staining showed that the intestinal mucosa in the control and PJ group was normal and no obvious abnormalities were found. The number of goblet cells in the model group decreased obviously, and a large number of in ammatory cell in ltration could be seen in these two groups (Fig. 5E).\n3.6 PJ repair the intestinal barrier in UC Mice\nAs shown in Fig. 6, AB-PAS indicated that mucus secretion was reduced in DSS groups, which could be improved by PJ (P < 0.01). Then, the expressions of MUC-2 and Occludin were tested by immunohistochemistry (IHC). The results showed that high and middle dose of PJ can signi cantly increase the expression of MUC-2 and Occludin compared with the DSS group (P < 0.01).\n3.7 PJ Suppresses the NF-\u03baB/NLRP3 In ammasome Axis Activation in UC Mice\nTUNEL was applied to detect the level of DNA damage in the colon. PJ administration reduced the apoptosis rate of colon tissue in UC mice (Fig.\u00a07A). The NLRP3 in ammasome is a cytoplasmic multimolecular platform that is composed of NLRP3, ASC, and procaspase-1. We measured the expression level of the NLRP3 in ammasome to evaluate whether NLRP3 was involved in the DSSinduced colon injury. The results of IHC showed that the expression of ASC and Casp-1 in PJ-treated mice was lower than that in DSS mice (P < 0.01) (Fig.\u00a07A). The results of qPCR showed that treatment with PJ could reduce the level of NLRP3 in ammasome and GSDMD (P < 0.01) (Fig.\u00a07B). The levels of IL-18 and IL-1\u03b2 were dramatically increased in the DSS group while decreased in the PJ group (P < 0.01) (Fig. 7C).\n4 Discussion UC is an in ammatory disease of the colon which would lead to colon ulcers and in ammation. Clinical symptoms include diarrhea, intermittent bloody diarrhea, abdominal pain and tenesmus(Feuerstein &Cheifetz 2014). Colon injuries induced by DSS are mainly due to permeability and proin ammatory cytokines, which lead to epithelial damage, a common pathological process of UC(Wang et al. 2020). More and more evidence proved that the in ammatory response plays an important role in the\nPage 10/22\nprogression of DSS-induced UC(Wang et al. 2021). Portulaca oleracea L., a traditional Chinese herbal, has shown the potential therapeutic effects of intestinal in ammation(Di Cagno et al. 2019, Kong et al. 2018).\nIn this study, we rst performed the component analysis to identify major components of POE and PJ. The results revealed that there were rich avonoids, terpenoids, organic acids, and alkaloids in POE and PJ. These compounds have various biological activities such as anti-oxidative, anti-in ammatory, antitumor, antiviral and antibacterial. We also found PJ had more bioactive compounds than POE, which indicated that PJ may have better pharmacological effects. Then we used network pharmacology to elucidate the mechanism of PO in treating ulcerative colitis. The key targets including PPARG, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, TP53, ESR1, MAPK14, CAT, and PTGS2 are directly related to anti-in ammatory effects. In the classical in ammatory signaling pathways, target proteins such as PPARG, TNF, IL-1B, IL-6, and MAPK play a crucial role, which can inhibit in ammation, reduce in ammatory pathological changes, promote cell differentiation, cell growth and apoptosis, as well as activate oxidative stress and in ammatory response(Miao et al. 2019). Most of the therapeutic targets of PO are enriched in the cancer pathway, suggesting that Amaranthus may prevent colon cancer by inhibiting the cancer pathway. Interestingly, we found that compared with POE, PJ had more overlapping targets with PE, which suggested PJ may perform better in the treatment of UC.\nIn order to con rm the network pharmacology results, we established a UC model to explore the effect of POE and PJ, the results showed that both POE and PJ can improve body weight and colon length, which were concerned as indirect indexes in the assessment of the severity of UC. Moreover, DAI scores were reported as an important parameter in the development of UC(Cooper et al. 1993), and the results indicated that PO could decrease the DAI scores. The results of the histological analysis showed that DSS administration in uenced the submucosa and cryptal glands, and the submucosa was in ltrated by numerous in ammatory cells. However, the above changes were improved by the treatment of PO while the PJ had a better effect compared with POE. The reason might be that the steaming process decreased the phenolic composition and antioxidant activity of row PO, which was consistent with the previous ndings(Fernandez-Poyatos et al. 2021).\nAs we all know, one of the most important characteristics of UC is the uncontrolled production of proin ammatory cytokines which lead to severe injury of the intestinal mucosa(Park et al. 2017). The major in ammatory cytokines including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), and IL-6, can activate NF-\u03baB and promote the secretion of other cytokines(Kuno &Matsushima 1994, Liu &Malik 2006, Paik et al. 2003). The results of the antibody array membrane showed that BLC, IL-1\u03b1, TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-17, and INF-\u03b3, which were considered the targets of in ammatory diseases (YamamotoFurusho 2018), were signi cantly suppressed by PJ. Among these cytokines, the upregulation of IL-1\u03b2 was associated with pyroptosis(Eder 2009, Ran et al. 2021) which is considered a unique form of cell death.\nMoreover, activation of the NLRP3 in ammasome can lead to pyroptosis. NLRP3 in ammasomes have been proven to be associated with colitis pathogenesis(Shao et al. 2019, Zhen &Zhang 2019). Once the\nPage 11/22\nNLRP3 in ammasomes are activated, they will provide a platform for the activation of caspase-1(Kim et al. 2019), then, the pro-forms of interleukin 1\u03b2 (pro-IL-1\u03b2) and IL-18 (pro-IL-18) will be converted to the active forms mediated by caspase-1. The amino-terminal gasdermin-N and carboxy-terminal gasdermin-C domains in GSDMD were cleaved by caspase-1. GSDMD is an executioner mediating cell lysis and in ammatory factor release, thereby inducing pyroptosis(Mulvihill et al. 2018). So, the expression of NLRP3, caspase-1, and GSDMD was measured both in vivo and in vitro. The results showed that the expression of NLRP3, caspase-1, and GSDMD was increased by DSS treatment, suggesting that pyroptosis induced by the NLRP3 in ammasome might be the potential mechanism underlying DSSinduced colon injury. PJ administration signi cantly downregulated the expression of the NLRP3 in ammasome. This result was consistent with the previous study indicating that the inhibition of NLRP3 in ammasome activation alleviates colon injury(Marinho et al. 2021).\nThe increased secretion of in ammatory cytokines can also lead to intestinal epithelial necrosis, and tight junction protein decreased. The epithelial barrier plays a very important role in the mucosal immune system, isolating the external stimuli and host immune cells(Camilleri et al. 2012, Ford et al. 2013). The defective epithelial barrier allows the intestinal microbiota to migrate to the cell side and stimulates the immune system and further leads to in ammation(Merga et al. 2014, Vindigni et al. 2016). Clinical trials proved that epithelial barrier dysfunction is associated with the occurrence and development of UC(McCole 2014, Schmitz et al. 1999). The major tight junction proteins and the mucus layer of the colon constitute the basic structure of the barrier(Kimura et al. 1997). Our results showed that PJ can upregulate the expression levels of MUC-2 and Occludin proteins and mRNAs in the intestinal tissues compared with the DSS group, which was similar to the previous results(Ibrahim et al. 2021, Kang et al. 2021). These results indicated that the restoration of barrier function may be part of the mechanism of PJ in inhibiting UC.\nTherefore, reducing the secretion of in ammatory factors and repairing the intestinal barrier are the treatments for UC. However, this study also has some limitations, due to the complexity of herbal components, the effective ingredients and other effective factors in the pathway need to be further studied. In short, inhibiting NLRP3 in ammasome and pyroptosis to improve the epithelial barrier may be a mechanism in the treatment of PJ for UC.\nIn conclusion, we demonstrated that PJ can alleviate the symptoms of UC in mice induced by DSS. The underlying therapeutic mechanism may be that PJ repairs colonic barrier integrity via suppressing the activation of NLRP3 in ammasome, providing a novel insight into the protective effect of PJ on UC.\n5 Additional Requirements List Of Abbreviations UC: ulcerative colitis; PO: Portulaca oleracea L.; POE: Portulaca oleracea L.
