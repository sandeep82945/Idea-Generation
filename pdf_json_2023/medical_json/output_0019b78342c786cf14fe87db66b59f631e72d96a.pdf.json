    "abstractText": "Person-centered recovery planning (PCRP) has been a key aspect in mental health system transformation and delivering quality health care. Despite the mandate to deliver this practice and a growing evidence base, its implementation and understanding of implementation processes in behavioral health settings remain a challenge. New England Mental Health Technology Transfer Center (MHTTC) launched the PCRP in Behavioral Health Learning Collaborative to support agencies\u2019 implementation efforts through training and technical assistance. In an effort to explore and understand the internal implementation process changes facilitated by the learning collaborative, the authors conducted qualitative key informant interviews with the participants and the leadership of the PCRP learning collaborative. The interviews revealed the processes that are part of the PCRP implementation efforts, including staff training, changing agency policies and procedures, modifying treatment planning tools, and the structure of the electronic health records. The higher prior organizational investment and readiness for change, building staff\u2019s competencies in PCRP, leadership investment, and frontline staff buy-in act as factors that facilitate the implementation of PCRP in behavioral health settings. Our findings inform both the implementation of PCRP in behavioral health settings and future efforts of organizing multi-agency learning collaboratives to support PCRP implementation.",

            "text": "After years of an illness-based model of mental health care, efforts have been made to transform behavioral healthcare systems toward a recovery-based model of care (Corrigan et\u00a0al., 2012; Davidson et\u00a0al., 2007; SAMHSA, 2006). Person-centered recovery planning (PCRP) has become a central tool in this process (Adams & Grieder, 2005; Davidson et\u00a0al., 2009; Miller et\u00a0al., 2017; SAMHSA, 2006; Tondora et\u00a0al., 2014). It is defined as \u201ca collaborative process between the person and their behavioral health care providers and natural supporters, that results in the development and implementation of an action plan to assist the person in\nachieving his or her unique, personal goals along the journey of recovery\u201d (Tondora et\u00a0al., 2012, p. 411). An increasing body of evidence has begun to show that PCRP improves individuals\u2019 health outcomes, engagement in treatment, medication adherence, and overall service user experience (Miller et\u00a0al., 2017; Stanhope et\u00a0al., 2013, 2015, 2021; Tondora et\u00a0al., 2014).\nThe U.S. Substance Abuse and Mental Health Service Administration (SAMHSA)\u2019s 10 Components of Recovery, as well as various fiscal, regulatory, and quality oversight bodies all endorse and require person-centered language and practices that PCRP supports (Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, 2014; Joint Commission, 2010; SAMHSA, 2006, 2015). Although long-standing models of person-centered planning in the developmental disabilities field can bolster efforts to meet the increasing institutional demand for PCRP, there is little guidance around adapting and implementing PCRP to the unique needs and preferences of behavioral health consumers (Butterworth et\u00a0al., 1993; Mount, 1992; O\u2019Brien, 1987). Specifically, confusion * Milena Stanojlovi\u0107 milena.stanojlovic@yale.edu 1 Program for\u00a0Recovery and\u00a0Community Health (PRCH), Department of\u00a0Psychiatry, School of\u00a0Medicine, Yale University, 319 Peck Street, Erector Square, Bldg. 1, New\u00a0Haven, CT\u00a006513, USA\n1 3\nexists around strategies for maintaining a strengths-based, person-centered approach to collaborative planning while simultaneously satisfying complex documentation requirements associated with state regulations and funder expectations (Tondora et\u00a0al., 2021).\nTo address this implementation gap, learning collaboratives are increasingly used in general and in behavioral healthcare as a strategy for quality improvement and implementation of evidence-based practices (Hoge et\u00a0al., 2020). Learning collaboratives is a group approach organized and facilitated by expert faculty for clinical providers from multiple agencies that come together to learn, share strategies, successes, and obstacles to quality improvement in health care (Hoge et\u00a0al., 2020; Institute for Healthcare Improvement, 2003).\u00a0This approach has been shown to improve several aspects of behavioral care, such as trauma-informed practices (Amaya-Jackson et\u00a0al., 2018), behavioral and primary care integration (Meredith et\u00a0al., 2006), supported employment (Bond et\u00a0al., 2016), and school mental health (Connors et\u00a0al., 2020), but more research on the learning collaborative effectiveness and key components is needed (Nadeem et\u00a0al., 2016; Schouten et\u00a0al., 2008; Wells et\u00a0al., 2018).\nSince there is limited knowledge on barriers and facilitators of implementation of PCRP in behavioral health settings and what the active implementation looks like (Borg et\u00a0al., 2009; Miller et\u00a0al., 2017; Lodge et\u00a0al., 2017; Tondora et\u00a0al., 2012), the aim of this program evaluation is to explore and understand the implementation factors and change processes that facilitate or hinder the implementation of PCRP on the ground among the behavioral health organizations that participated in an intensive PCRP technical assistance and training initiative."

            "heading": "Person\u2011Centered Recovery Planning Learning Collaborative",
            "text": "In the beginning of 2019, the New England Mental Health Technology Transfer Center (MHTTC) carried out a regional needs assessment among the community stakeholders in New England and revealed that there was a burning need for implementation support around PCRP. In order to respond to this identified regional need, in December 2019, the New England MHTTC launched a Person-Centered Recovery Planning in Behavioral Health Learning Collaborative. This learning collaborative was a multi-agency project aimed to provide training, technical assistance, and implementation support to the participating behavioral health organizations around the practice of PCRP. Learning collaborative has been chosen as a strategy and informed by the previous experience with implementation of PCRP in similar initiatives (Lodge et\u00a0al., 2017), theoretical implementation\nscience frameworks such as Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) (Damschroder et\u00a0 al., 2009), Healthcare Improvement Breakthrough Series model (Institute for Healthcare Improvement, 2003), as well as the National Implementation Research Network recommendations (Fixsen et\u00a0al., 2005).\nA formal application process resulted in the recruitment of five behavioral health organizations representing the states of Maine, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island. A competitive application process included questions to determine if 1) the organization\u2019s needs matched learning collaborative goals and 2) the degree to which the organization was committed to meeting program requirements. In addition to an online application, a Letter of Support from agency leadership (e.g., Executive Director, President, etc.), an internal PCRP change team, and evidence of active and ongoing involvement of people with lived experience of behavioral health concerns were required. The participating agencies varied in size, funding mechanisms, organizational readiness for change, and existing exposure to recovery-oriented practices. Agencies also had differing scopes of change regarding PCRP.\nAgencies were encouraged to involve between four to six individuals in their change team representing the following types of roles: clinical supervisor/team lead, direct support practitioner, quality monitoring representative, person in recovery, peer supporter, rehabilitation specialist, cultural competence representative, agency executive leadership, and any project-specific personnel (e.g., information technology specialists if an agency was interested in redesigning assessment and planning templates within their Electronic Health Records (EHR)). At the beginning of the learning collaborative, 27 people enrolled from five agencies and started participating in the scheduled activities. The number and type of active participants from each learning collaborative agency varied.\nThis learning collaborative focused on the review of key indicators of PCRP from both a process and a documentation perspective. Emphasis was placed on strategies for maintaining a strengths-based recovery orientation in collaborative care planning while simultaneously meeting rigorous documentation standards associated with fiscal and regulatory requirements. Participating agencies received interactive training (both online and face-to-face), discussion-based webinars, and individualized technical assistance to support the implementation of PCRP practices. The learning collaborative began with a series of introductory webinars in December of 2019 and convened all member agencies in March of 2020 for a face-to-face kick-off event to provide a two-day intensive skills training in PCRP. During this training, agencies were able to review several narratives about people with various behavioral health goals. PCRP change teams applied the skills they learned in initial webinars to\n1 3\ndraft person-centered recovery plans and got feedback from trainers in the moment. During the second day of training, change teams shared their progress with each other and created action plans for how their agencies would transform their practices and environments, EHRs, and treatment planning processes to better reflect PCRP principles and practices.\nImmediately after the skills training event, planned collaborative activities had to be paused due to the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic to allow agencies to focus on the priority of client care and rapid conversion to telehealth platforms. When the learning collaborative activities resumed after the COVID-19 interruption, in the summer of 2020, the number of agency representatives dropped from the initial 27 to 15 people that remained involved until the end of the initiative. The resumed collaborative activities included monthly individualized technical assistance calls to support agency-level PCRP implementation plans and bi-monthly group technical assistance calls to allow for the cross-fertilization of learning and sharing of resources among participants. Although it was scheduled to conclude in December of 2020, supports were extended for three months due to significant project disruptions caused by the pandemic. Followup technical assistance has been provided through virtual platforms to accommodate multiple states simultaneously and to adapt in response to the ongoing pandemic."

Based on a detailed accounting of the attendance records, nine select representatives from each agency were invited to participate in key informant interviews if they had attended a minimum number of learning collaborative activities so that they would have the baseline familiarity to offer opinions about the learning collaborative experience and the PRCP implementation processes.\nFurthermore, the sample of the key informants represented a range of roles across organizations. Namely, three of them were in executive and program leadership roles (CEO, clinical, and program director), one worked in quality improvement, one as an IT expert, three as program supervisors, and one as a peer support specialist.

            "text": "The thematic analysis of nine semi-structured key informant interviews with learning collaborative participants from all five agencies and one focus group discussion with the leadership team of the learning collaborative revealed the following themes under our two target questions.\nTheme 1: Intensive Skills Training\nBesides the individual technical assistance calls, the participants emphasized the initial 2-day intensive skills training in PCRP as one of the most useful components of the learning collaborative. Although the majority of the participants mentioned that the scheduled activities were enough to achieve their objectives, one agency solicited additional training to be provided to all of their case managers to increase staff competency in PCRP.\nThe learning collaborative leadership team pointed out that strengthening staff\u2019s competency through more in-depth skills training until they got comfortable enough to use PCRP was a necessary first step and only then start providing support on how to implement this practice in the context of an organization.\nWe can work with a small [agency] leadership team and we can start modifying policies and procedures and helping them think through the design of their electronic health record. And we got lots of tools into their hands around what does quality look like. [\u2026] To have uptake within their staff, the staff have to have a certain baseline level of knowledge within which to understand what they're getting, right? You start changing the treatment plan I'm supposed to use, you start changing the policies, you start giving me these handouts to give to my clients, I don't even know what this is all about.\nTheme 2: Monthly Technical Assistance Calls\nThe general impression was that the learning collaborative had a good mix of individual and group activities. The participants almost unanimously said that the individual monthly technical assistance calls were the most useful\ncomponents of the learning collaborative. They all agreed that the individual agency calls provided the\u00a0most practical operational solutions and resources tailored to the specific needs of their agency for implementing PCRP. To illustrate the importance of it, one of the participants particularly values the chance to have individual conversations about how something that \u201cmight sound good in theory, looks like in practice.\u201d Additionally, the leadership of the learning collaborative has been working with member agencies through resource sharing and individualized technical assistance calls to re-design EHR platforms and develop accompanying training tools to support their adoption. The participants\u2019 feedback suggests that this has been a particularly practical and valued component of the supports offered in the learning collaborative.\nTheme 3: Leadership Accessibility and\u00a0Continuous"

It was also suggested that short monthly reports could have been a good way to share basic information and facilitate coordination between different locations in order to build a consensus among staff at these sites. Others, however, thought that requiring more structure would not have been that helpful given their agencies\u2019 current needs in the pre-implementation stage.\nThe leadership of the learning collaborative believes that a more structured monthly approach increases agencies\u2019 commitment and motivation. They find it beneficial to have agency implementation plans to follow during a learning collaborative. These expectations need to be communicated explicitly in the application process ahead of time.\n1 3\nTheme 5: Certification and\u00a0Professional"

            "heading": "Development",
            "text": "Participating in this learning collaborative was seen as an opportunity for professional growth and goal attainability for the staff. Some people suggested that linking a PCRP certification or educational/professional development credits to participation in similar initiatives in the future could justify higher expectations for regular updates and boost participants\u2019 motivation to engage in more structured requirements without perceiving it as a burden.\nTheme 6: Early Involvement of\u00a0Frontline Staff\nSeveral interviewees wished that the need for involvement of the frontline staff had been recognized earlier on in the initiative and had involved them in the technical assistance calls instead of limiting these to the senior leadership. A member of the frontline staff states the following:\nIf there were more key players that actually work in the field with people it would be excellent [\u2026] I think to help implement, it would make the buy-in a lot better and the understanding\u2026 so that when they talk about this stuff, they have a greater understanding of what actually is happening and how it's gonna [\u2026] affect other people and how they could help others to make this transition.\nIn the same line, one participant in the leadership role mentioned that a top-to-bottom approach could not work.\nIt's all too often, you have the people at the top of an agency [who] will make changes and they force it down on people without getting their view on it and the acceptance, because if you have, if you don't get them to it, to get involved, you're not going to go anywhere with it because they're always going to buck the trend.\nTheme 7: Pairing Agencies to\u00a0Enhance Learning\nRecognizing that the participating agencies were at different levels of implementation and readiness for change, and therefore had different needs, the participants\u2019 opinions were divided regarding the possibility of mutual learning. While a portion of the participants thought that being in a mixed group of agencies was a \u201cunique and inspiring opportunity to share experiences and learn from each other,\u201d the others did not find the group meetings contributing much to their efforts and learning and could not relate to the reporting and operations of the agencies that were too different from their own in terms of size, structure, and PCRP implementation\nneeds. Generally speaking, participants pointed out that going forward it would be more beneficial to be paired with more similar agencies.\nThe learning collaborative leadership recognized the benefits of having a mixed group of people as \u201can opportunity for cross-fertilization and positive peer pressure,\u201d but that \u201cmeeting the needs of such a diverse group of agencies that were on the opposite sides of the implementation continuum occasionally presented a challenge.\u201d The leadership also felt that when participating agencies differed too much in their initial readiness to change/level of implementation, it became difficult to reconcile which may have lessened the benefits of the mutual learning experience. This aspect requires more attention when selecting agencies for participation in future learning collaboratives.\nTheme 8: Organizational Readiness\nThe interviewer asked the members of the participating agencies to determine the stage of readiness for change of their agency/program before and after participating in the learning collaborative in order to determine any change in organizational readiness and intention to implement PCRP. All five agencies reported that they started the learning collaborative at least with the contemplation stage, perceiving the need to change or improve their practice. However, they estimated the progress in their organizational readiness for change after the learning collaborative differently. Two of the five agencies reported that they made progress to the implementation stage by the end of the learning collaborative. Two agencies\u2019 representatives reported that they ended with the decision stage, indicating an intention to implement, seek additional information, and try out the practice. One agency\u2019s representative estimated that they ended the learning collaborative at the highest maintenance stage.\nThe learning collaborative leadership team was asked separately to do the same for each participating agency/program to be able to contrast their perspectives and estimate the agreement between them and the individual participants. The leadership reported that two of the five agencies made progress from the decision to the\u00a0 implementation stage. They estimated that another two of five agencies saw the need to change from the beginning of the learning collaborative (contemplation) but did not increase their readiness for change over time. One agency entered the learning collaborative with a decision to implement but had limited success in moving further than that. The observed pattern is that the agencies that had a prior investment in PCRP and entered the learning collaborative having decided to make a change, overall did better and progressed further in the implementation process.\nFour of the nine people interviewed had fully agreed with the leadership on the stages of change with which their\n1 3\nagency/program started and ended the learning collaborative (44% of mutual agreement). Three more people agreed with the leadership\u2019s opinion on where they ended upon the completion of the learning collaborative (33% partial agreement), whereas 2 people estimated both their pre and poststages of change drastically differently from the opinion of the leadership (22% of disagreement).\nTheme 9: Scope of\u00a0Change\nAs the agencies had different implementation goals and processes from the beginning, they achieved different levels of change in implementing PCRP, ranging from basic dissemination of information at one end of the spectrum to genuine change in practice at the other end. In one agency, a single champion was disseminating the information about the PCRP language and approaches to their staff through individual supervising conversations. Two of the five agencies focused on a more formal internal PCRP training offered through orientation sessions for the new staff and/or through existing training for the experienced staff to build their competency around the philosophy, documentation, and practice of PCRP. One agency reported changing their hiring criteria to take into account the knowledge and attitudes about PCRP when interviewing new staff. Two out of the five agencies went beyond training to create and start using new assessment and treatment planning tools aligned with PCRP and focused their efforts on modifying their EHRs to accommodate the needs/characteristics of the new PCRP tools. As an example, one of the participants describes that their agency was \u201cin the process of changing both the way we treat our patients and our ability to deliver quality care.\u201d Another participant who provides administrative support described the processes at their agency:\nI think the change that we're making is larger in scope than the changes that some of the other agencies made, because we're going from a treatment plan that was driven by [American Society of Addiction Medicine] ASAM criteria, extremely rigid, to the PCRP treatment plan. That's a pretty dramatic change.\nOne participant in the leadership role felt that the learning collaborative helped them refine the PCRP processes that were already in place and making them more relevant to their clients:\nThey were able to put together a very good [training] package so that when we left there, we could actually, you know, get on the ground running and going forward to implement it into our organization. [\u2026] In a way we're doing the same type of work grassroots here, but then they gave a name to it and then they got to fine tune it for us. We were able to kind of boost\nthat up to make it even more so important to us as a group, but also to help our clients even more because there were certain things that we were missing that they brought to light.\nTheme 10: Organizational Change Requires Time and\u00a0Patience\nSeveral key informants pointed out different aspects of the implementation process, such as the importance of time invested between the sessions, as well as the speed and complexity of implementing organizational change. It was noticeable that the agencies implementing more in-depth changes (i.e., changes in the treatment planning practice, modifying the EHR to accommodate the PCRP tools) sought additional feedback and support from the leadership more often and dedicated more additional time and resources to work between the regularly scheduled learning collaborative sessions towards their PCRP implementation goals. Additionally, some member agencies pointed out that implementing PCRP takes investing a lot of time in internal conversations, building guided discussions with the staff, and building pieces of that work into the products/tools. It takes more than a training or a meeting to build a consensus among the staff and reduce their potential resistance to the new practice. As one participant summed it up: \u201cIf you move faster, it won\u2019t sustain.\u201d\nTheme 11: Multiple Factors Facilitate"

            "heading": "Implementation",
            "text": "The most important factors that the participants and the leadership team of the learning collaborative identified as facilitators of PCRP implementation included having: (1) an innovative and supportive organizational culture, (2) a diverse/mixed composition of the implementation teams, (3) both frontline and senior leadership staff buy-in and active involvement, (4) higher organizational readiness and need for change, and (5) accrediting and funding bodies\u2019 mandate to deliver person-centered care. The learning collaborative leadership found that teams that had good horizontal and vertical representation and complementary roles in their implementation teams started implementing PCRP following the training.\nFrom the interviews, it was noticeable that the two agencies that, based on the pre-post organizational readiness ratings, proceeded further with the implementation, had a more shared understanding with the leadership team of what it takes to successfully implement PCRP, in a sense of 1) investing time and resources between learning collaborative sessions to get traction with implementation, 2) heavy investment from leadership in this initiative, 3) developing\n1 3\nstaff capacity in PRCP, and only then 4) proceed with the implementation of PCRP.\nTheme 12: Pandemic Disruption of\u00a0Implementation\nThe unprecedented circumstances of the COVID-19 pandemic were identified as a major unpredicted factor that had a decisive impact on implementation of PCRP and on conducting the learning collaborative itself. Both the participants and the leadership team emphasized the detrimental impact of the pandemic on reducing organizations\u2019 initial levels of involvement in the PCRP implementation process and their commitment to the learning collaborative activities. Specifically, the pandemic has hindered the capacity of some agencies to adopt and implement new PCRP practices. It disrupted the implementation momentum and caused some members of the team to drop off from participating in the learning collaborative activities or to lose staff members altogether. Smaller agencies seemed to have been particularly struck by COVID-19, compared to some of the larger ones with more established and deeper infrastructure. The pandemic also made it impossible to conduct in-person meetings which some participants found to be a more effective and engaging way to communicate. The leadership, in turn, felt they needed to moderate their initial expectations for the learning collaborative, and\u00a0desist from the initially planned, more structured approach to the learning collaborative to provide more flexibility and leeway for the participating agencies struggling to adapt to the COVID-19 circumstances."

            "heading": "Discussion",
            "text": "The implementation of a complex recovery-oriented practice such as PCRP requires attention to multiple aspects of the change process including overall agency readiness for change, stakeholder competencies in PCRP, and organizational business practices. Attention to all areas is necessary in order to get traction and advance the practice of PCRP. This evaluation study has been an opportunity to gain a deeper understanding of how these factors interacted in the\u00a0implementation processes of PCRP in five behavioral health agencies in New England. The aim of this evaluation was to discover the process changes facilitated by the learning collaborative, but not to contribute to generalizable knowledge about whether these process changes actually led to the implementation and delivery of the PCRP.\nThe authors observed that the scope of the changes that the agencies achieved on the ground as a result of the PCRP learning collaborative has been different for each of them. Two out of the five agencies went further in changing their processes and implementing what they learned through\ntraining. They have put in practice new person-centered treatment planning procedures and modified the structure of their EHR tracking and documentation systems to accommodate these new procedures. Previous experience has shown that establishing person-centered EHRs that could at the same time satisfy the billing and regulatory documentation standards is crucial for the providers to deliver PCRP (Tondora et\u00a0al., 2021). The three other agencies have focused on disseminating the information to their internal teams and expanding internal training to boost the staff\u2019s competency in PCRP. Previous research had shown that PCRP training is a necessary component to increase providers\u2019 competency in the delivery of person-centered care, and that this effect increased over time (Stanhope et\u00a0al, 2021). Moreover, it is known that greater organizational readiness for change is a necessary, but not sufficient, factor for successful implementation. In line with the discrepancies the authors found in the perceptions of organizational readiness, it has been recognized earlier that organizational members tend to misjudge organizational readiness by overestimating or underestimating their capacity to execute the intended intervention (Weiner, 2009).\nFurthermore, several features of the learning collaborative itself have proved to be important for optimizing engagement and implementation efforts among the participants. First, bringing together agencies of similar levels of organizational readiness can foster cross-fertilization and mutual learning. Second, technical assistance and ongoing communication tailored to agency needs have proven to be the key component of a successful learning collaborative and implementation. Third, including frontline staff in the discussions from the beginning seemed to be an important factor for successful implementation. The presence and investment from the agency leadership seem to be equally important as the involvement of the frontline staff in designing implementation plans. Many of these factors resonate with previous findings on barriers and facilitators of implementing PCRP, including those in the domain of infrastructure, leadership, and dissemination barriers (Lodge et\u00a0al., 2017). Finally, the leadership of the learning collaborative felt strongly about having a more structured approach to organizing the learning collaborative activities, such as having monthly implementation plans or change packages. Research on the most useful components of the learning collaboratives suggests that such observation is beneficial for participants\u2019 motivation, social support, and project management skills in the implementation process (Nembhard, 2009). Expectations for regular updates and commitment should be clearly communicated in the initial application.\nThese findings can further inform the designs of future multi-agency learning collaboratives. Specifically, the themes identified in the key informant interviews could inform the development of a more structured questionnaire\n1 3\nfor future participating agencies as a tool to document more systematically their PCRP implementation activities. This tool delivered to the agencies could refer to the pre- and post- topic areas such as offering PCRP orientation sessions to the new staff, developing PCRP planning tools, or modifying EHR.\nAn additional value of this study lies in the fact that training and technical assistance evaluation usually relies on measures of satisfaction, knowledge, and usefulness, while information about the change of practice as a result of the training tends to be limited. This evaluation intended to take into account further translation of knowledge into changing practice as a result of a training and technical assistance initiative."

Due to a significant drop-off of participants, the sampling frame was reduced from the initial 27 to 15 people who had a minimum level of engagement defined by the degree to which they participated in a range of activities offered by the LC. Second, given that the goal of this evaluation was to understand what did and did not work well for those who completed the collaborative, the sample does not include the perspective of the people who did not continue to participate after the initial training. The utility of including these individuals in the study sample was questioned due to their lack of involvement and knowledge of the learning collaborative. Although those individuals could have been engaged to provide feedback about what led them to not complete the learning collaborative, that was not the focus of the study. Third, the presence of one coder may bias the findings of the qualitative analysis. In order to overcome this limitation, the coder cross-checked the findings with other team members and the key informants to ensure the reliability of the findings. Fourth, the COVID-19 pandemic caused disruptions in the planned activities of the learning collaborative, agencies\u2019 implementation processes, and their initial commitment. At this point, we cannot estimate with certainty the full impact of the pandemic and whether more agencies would have progressed further in their implementation of PCRP had it not been for the pandemic. Finally, our evaluation lacks process data. Future data collection efforts should include pre-assessments of knowledge and attitudes around PCRP as well as\u00a0organizational readiness for change to be able to report more objectively on the impact of the training and technical assistance activities. The next steps would require further research studies of implementation and sustainment of the intervention in\nlonger observation periods in order to analyze whether the implementation processes actually lead to improved implementation and delivery of PRCP, eventually improving the patient-level outcomes. Future studies could benefit from more in-depth interviews with a larger sample of participants that would allow more refined analysis and contribute more generalizable knowledge regarding implementation of PRCP in behavioral health settings.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s43477- 023- 00078-3.\nAcknowledgements We would like to thank the study participants who shared their feedback as key informants.
