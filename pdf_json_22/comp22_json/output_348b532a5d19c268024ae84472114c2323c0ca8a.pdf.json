    "abstractText": "Traditional analysis of dynamical systems usually assumes that the mapping is continuous \u2013 in precise mathematical sense. However, as many formal definitions, the mathematical definition of continuity does not always adequately capture the commonsense notion of continuity: that small changes in the input should lead to small changes in the output. In this paper, we provide a natural fuzzy-based formalization of this intuitive notion, and analyze how the requirement of commonsense continuity affects the properties of dynamical systems. Specifically, we show that for such systems, the set of fixed points is closed and convex, and that the only such systems for which we can both effectively predict the future and effectively reconstruct the past are linear systems. 1 Formulation of the Problem Many real-life processes are described by dynamical systems, in which the state s(t + 1) in the next moment time is uniquely determined by the state s(t) at the current moment of time: s(t +1) = f (s(t)) for some continuous function f (s). For a given dynamical system, it is usually important to describe all its stationary states, i.e., states with the following property: once the system reaches such a state, it remains in this state. Applications of stationary states range from self-sustaining ecological systems to stationary satellites that provide reliable communications. In general, the set if all stationary states can be complicated, difficult to describe and even more difficult to compute.

            "text": "The difference. Most of us are so accustomed to the formal mathematical definition of continuity that we tend to forget that \u2013 as many formal definitions \u2013 it does not fully capture the commonsense idea of continuity. To many of us, the difference between mathematical and commonsense continuity surfaces only when we try to communicate with folks who are not mathematically trained.\nThis difference can be illustrated on a very simple example. Suppose that we have a function f (x) which is:\n\u2022 equal to 0 for x \u2264 0, equal to 1 for x \u2265 \u03b5 for some small \u03b5 > 0, and \u2022 equal to x/\u03b5 for values x between 0 and \u03b5 .\nFrom the mathematical viewpoint, no matter how small \u03b5 is, this function is continuous. However, from the commonsense viewpoint, when \u03b5 becomes small, the function clearly becomes discontinuous \u2013 if we draw its graph, we will see an abrupt transition.\nHow can we describe the difference between these two notions in general terms? We know the mathematical definition of continuity, but how can we describe the commonsense continuity?\nWhat is commonsense continuity. From the commonsense viewpoint, continuity of a function f (x) means that if a is close to b, then f (a) is close to f (b). This is not a formal definition: instead of using a precise description in terms of the distance d(a,b), it uses an imprecise word \u201cclose\u201d.\nA natural way to describe such imprecise (\u201cfuzzy\u201d) words in precise terms is to use fuzzy logic \u2013 technique that was designed exactly for such a transition; see, e.g., [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]. In this technique, each imprecise notion \u2013 in particular, the notion of being close \u2013 is described by a function \u00b5(d) that assigns, to each value d = d(a,b) of the distance, the degree \u00b5(d(a,b)) to which the states a and b are close.\nThe farther away from each other are the states, the less close they are, so the function \u00b5(d) should be strictly decreasing.\nIn general, implication \u201cif A then B\u201d means that B is true whether A is true \u2013 and maybe in other cases as well. Thus, our degree of confidence in B should be larger than our degree of confidence in A.\nIn particular, the statement \u201cif a and b are close, then f (a) and f (b) should also be close\u201d implies that our degree of confidence \u00b5(d( f (a), f (b))) (that f (a) and f (b) are close) should be larger than or equal to our degree of confidence \u00b5(d(a,b)) that a and b are close: \u00b5(d( f (a), f (b)))\u2265 \u00b5(d(a,b)). Since the function \u00b5(d) is strictly decreasing, this inequality is equivalent to\nd( f (a), f (b))\u2264 d(a,b). (1)\nThis inequality \u2013 called 1-Lipschitz property in mathematics \u2013 is thus an appropriate description of commonsense continuity.\nDefinition 1. By a commonsense-continuous dynamical system, we mean a mapping f : IRn 7\u2192 IRn for which, for all a,b \u2208 IRn, we have d( f (a), f (b))\u2264 d(a,b).\nComment. It is easy to check:\n\u2022 that every commonsense-continuous function is also continuous in the usual mathematical sense, and \u2022 that a composition of two commonsense-continuous functions is also commonsense-continuous."

            "text": "Definition 2. We say that the point a \u2208 IRn is a fixed point of the mapping f : IRn 7\u2192 IRn if f (a) = a.\nProposition 1. For each commonsense-continuous dynamical system, its set of fixed points is a closed convex set.\nProof. Closeness is easy to prove: if we have a sequence of fixed points an for which f (an) = an and an \u2192 a, then, due to mathematical continuity of the mapping f , we also have f (a) = a. So, the limit of fixed points is also a fixed point.\nTo complete the proof, it is thus sufficient to prove convexity. Let a and b be fixed points, i.e., f (a) = a and f (b) = b, and let c = \u03b1 \u00b7a+(1\u2212\u03b1) \u00b7b for some \u03b1 \u2208 (0,1). In this case, the points a, b, and c lie on the same line, with c being in between a and b, so\nd(a,b) = d(a,c)+d(b,c).\nLet us prove that f (c) = c. Indeed, by the definition of commonsense continuity, we have\nd( f (a), f (c))\u2264 d(a,c).\nSince f (a) = a, this means\nd(a, f (c))\u2264 d(a,c). (1)\nSimilarly, we get d( f (c), f (b)) = d( f (c),b)\u2264 d(c,b). (2)\nBy adding up the inequalities (1) and (2), we conclude that\nd(a, f (c))+d( f (c),b)\u2264 d(a,c)+d(c,b) = d(a,b).\nOn the other hand, due to the triangle inequality, we have\nd(a, f (c))+d( f (c),b)\u2265 d(a,b),\nthus d(a, f (c))+d( f (c),b) = d(a,b). (3)\nSo, f (c) lies on the line segment connecting a and b. We know that d(a, f (c)) \u2264 d(a,c). We cannot have d(a, f (c)) < d(a,c), since then, by adding (2) to this inequality, we would have\nd(a, f (c))+ f ( f (c),b)< d(a,c)+d(c,b) = d(a,b),\nand we know, from the formula (3), that the sum in the left-hand side is equal to d(a,b). Thus, we must have d(a, f (c)) = d(a,c). So, both points c and f (c) lie on the same line segment connecting a and b, at the exact same distance from a. Hence, indeed f (c) = c.\nThe proposition is proven."

            "text": "Predicting and reconstructing the past. By definition of a dynamical system, for each current state a, the state at the next moment of time is f (a). Similarly, the state at the previous moment of time is equal to f\u22121(a), where f\u22121 denotes the inverse function: f\u22121(a) = b if and only if f (b) = a.\nWhat does effective prediction mean. Effective prediction of the future means that if we know the current state approximately, i.e., we only know the state a\u0303 which is close to the actual state a, then the state f (a\u0303) that we predict based on this approximate knowledge should be close to the actual future state f (a) \u2013 the state that we would have predicted if we had the full knowledge of the current state a. In other words, effective prediction of the future means that the mapping f from the current state to the next state must be commonsense continuous.\nIf the function f (a) predicting the next state is commonsense-continuous, then predicting the next-to-next state \u2013 and any future state \u2013 is also commonsense-\ncontinuous, since the corresponding prediction functions f ( f (a)), f ( f ( f (a))), . . . , are compositions of commonsense-continuous functions.\nThus, we arrive at the following definition.\nDefinition 3. We say that a mapping f : IRn 7\u2192 IRn allows effective prediction if this mapping is commonsense-continuous.\nWhat does effective reconstruction of the past mean. Effective reconstruction of the past means that if we know the current state approximately, i.e., we only know the state a\u0303 which is close to the actual state a, then the past state f\u22121(a\u0303) that we reconstruct based on this approximate knowledge should be close to the actual past state f\u22121(a) \u2013 the state that we would have reconstructed if we had the full knowledge of the current state a. In other words, effective reconstruction of the past means that the mapping f\u22121 from the current state to the previous state must be commonsense continuous.\nIf the function f\u22121(a) reconstructing the previous state is commonsensecontinuous, then predicting the previous-to-previous state \u2013 and any past state \u2013 is also commonsense-continuous, since the corresponding reconstruction functions f\u22121 ( f\u22121(a) ) , f\u22121 ( f\u22121 ( f\u22121(a) )) , . . . , are compositions of commonsensecontinuous functions. Thus, we arrive at the following definition.\nDefinition 4. We say that a mapping f : IRn 7\u2192 IRn allows effective reconstruction of the past if its inverse f\u22121 is commonsense-continuous.\nResult. In the ideal world, we would like to be able both to effectively predict and to effectively reconstruct the past. Unfortunately, as the following simple result shows, for a nonlinear system, we cannot do both.\nProposition 2. If a mapping f allows both effective prediction and effective reconstruction of the past, then this mapping is linear.\nProof. If both f and f\u22121 are commonsense-continuous, this means that we have\nd( f (a), f (b))\u2264 d(a,b) (4)\nand d( f\u22121(a), f\u22121(b)) \u2264 d(a,b) for all a and b. For a\u2032 = f\u22121(a) and b\u2032 = f\u22121(b), we have a = f (a\u2032) and b = f (b\u2032), thus the second inequality takes the form\nd(a\u2032,b\u2032)\u2264 d( f (a\u2032), f (b\u2032)) (5)\nfor all a\u2032 and b\u2032. From (4) and (5), we conclude that d( f (a), f (b)) = d(a,b) for all a and b, i.e., that the mapping f preserves distance. It is known that all such mappings are linear.\nThe proposition is proven."
