    "abstractText": "Nudibranchs, as a group, have received limited attention in terms of scientific study along the coastline of Peru. Here, an updated and comprehensive list of nudibranch species found in the Peruvian sea is presented, compiled through an extensive review of relevant literature. This compilation encompasses a total of 31 species, classified into two suborders, 10 superfamilies, 20 families, and 28 genera. With respect to the biogeographic provinces along the Peruvian coast, 23 species inhabit the Warm Temperate Southeastern Pacific province, 18 species occur in the Tropical Eastern Pacific province, and 10 species are found in both provinces, crossing the transitional zone between them. In terms of distribution patterns, two species exhibit a cosmopolitan distribution (Glaucus atlanticus and Fiona pinnata), while two species display a circumtropical distribution (Cephalopyge trematoides and Phylliroe bucephala). One species exhibits a bipolar distribution in the Eastern Pacific and possesses an amphi-South American distribution (Rostanga pulchra). Additionally, six species exhibit an amphi-South American distribution (Rostanga pulchra, Diaulula punctuolata, Doto uva, Tyrinna evelinae, Tyrinna delicata, and Doris fontainii), and two species are endemic to Peru (Corambe mancorensis and Felimare sechurana). This study provides comprehensive information on biogeographical aspects, geographical distributions, and taxonomic updates within the nudibranch species documented in Peru. Furthermore, we discuss the status of species listed in previous literature that have not been confirmed by collections, referring to them as potentially occurring species.",

This is an open access article distributed under terms of the Creative Commons Attribution License (Attribution 4.0 International \u2013 CC BY 4.0).\nNudibranchs, as a group, have received limited attention in terms of scientific study along the coastline of Peru. Here, an updated and comprehensive list of nudibranch species found in the Peruvian sea is presented, compiled through an extensive review of relevant literature. This compilation encompasses a total of 31 species, classified into two suborders, 10 superfamilies, 20 families, and 28 genera. With respect to the biogeographic provinces along the Peruvian coast, 23 species inhabit the Warm Temperate Southeastern Pacific province, 18 species occur in the Tropical Eastern Pacific province, and 10 species are found in both provinces, crossing the transitional zone between them. In terms of distribution patterns, two species exhibit a cosmopolitan distribution (Glaucus atlanticus and Fiona pinnata), while two species display a circumtropical distribution (Cephalopyge trematoides and Phylliroe bucephala). One species exhibits a bipolar distribution in the Eastern Pacific and possesses an amphi-South American distribution (Rostanga pulchra). Additionally, six species exhibit an amphi-South American distribution (Rostanga pulchra, Diaulula punctuolata, Doto uva, Tyrinna evelinae, Tyrinna delicata, and Doris fontainii), and two species are endemic to Peru (Corambe mancorensis and Felimare sechurana). This study provides comprehensive information on biogeographical aspects, geographical distributions, and taxonomic updates within the nudibranch species documented in Peru. Furthermore, we discuss the status of species listed in previous literature that have not been confirmed by collections, referring to them as potentially occurring species.\nKey words: biogeography, bibliographic compilation, geographic distribution, Nudibranchia, Peru, sea slug, taxonomy"

These remarkable organisms exhibit striking aposematic body colorations, making them frequent targets of underwater photography. Approximately 3000 species of nudibranchs have been described worldwide inhabiting both cold and tropical regions (Shields 2009; Almada et al. 2016), primarily in shallow waters ranging from 0 to 30 m in depth (W\u00e4gele and Klussmann-Kolb 2005).

The ecological importance of nudibranchs stems from their role in controlling populations of cnidarians and poriferans, from which they acquire and incorporate toxins for their own defense (Greenwood 2009; Faulkner and Ghiselin 1983). Furthermore, recent research has elucidated symbiotic associations between nudibranchs and bacteria, wherein the bacteria provide essential nutrients to the hosts (Zhukova et al. 2022). Certain species have been found to synthesize secondary metabolites with high biotechnological potential (Pereira et al. 2012; Dean and Prinsep 2017). Additionally, nudibranch species possess the potential to serve as environmental indicators, as they are sensitive to ocean stressors such as coastal pollution (Caballer et al. 2008).\nThe most recent inventory of aquatic mollusks in Peru, as documented by Ram\u00edrez et al. (2003), recorded a total of 1018 marine species, primarily comprising gastropods and bivalves, with only a limited number of nudibranch species reported. In fact, the Peruvian sea is recognized as one of the impoverished regions worldwide in terms of nudibranch diversity (Schr\u00f6dl 1997, 2002, 2003; Schr\u00f6dl and Hooker 2014). In comparison, other regions such as the Caribbean Sea, the Tropical Eastern Pacific, the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea (Sachidhanandam et al. 2000; Vald\u00e9s et al. 2006; Chavanich et al. 2013; Ah Shee Tee et al. 2019; Furfaro et al. 2020; Londo\u00f1o-Cruz 2021), as well as other South American countries including Brazil, Chile, and Venezuela (Fischer and Cervera 2005b; Ardila et al. 2007; Aldea et al. 2011; Padula et al. 2011; Alvim and Pimenta 2013; Guti\u00e9rrez et al. 2015; Araya and Vald\u00e9s 2016; Londo\u00f1o-Cruz 2021) exhibit considerably higher richness of nudibranch species.\nThe earliest records of nudibranchs in Peru can be attributed to d\u2019Orbigny (1835\u20131846) and later to Dall (1909). Following a significant period without the discovery of new species, Millen et al. (1994) reported the presence of Okenia luna in Peruvian and Chilean waters. Subsequently, the first list of Peruvian aquatic mollusks was published, which included some nudibranch species (\u00c1lamo and Valdivieso 1997), and two years later, another list was published (Paredes et al. 1999), in which Sandra Millen was acknowledged for the preliminary list of species belonging to the infraclass Opisthobranchia (a taxonomic category that has since been abandoned and deprecated; see J\u00f6rger et al. 2010; Schr\u00f6dl et al. 2011; W\u00e4gele et al. 2014). In 2003, an updated inventory of Peruvian aquatic mollusks was published (Ram\u00edrez et al. 2003), which included the nudibranch species reported up to that time. Several years later, four new species were reported on the northern coast of Peru, Felimida baumanni, Doriopsilla janaina, Kynaria cynara, and Cuthona sp. (Nakamura 2006), with the species Corambe mancorensis identified as endemic (Martynov et al. 2011), and the species Spurilla neapolitana (later corrected as Spurilla braziliana) (Uribe and Pacheco 2012). Subsequently, four additional nudibranch species were documented for the Peruvian coast (Uribe et al. 2013), and another study focused on the species shared with Chile (Schr\u00f6dl and Hooker 2014). Felimare sechurana was identified as an endemic species in the transition zone of the northern coast (Hoover et al. 2017) and, additionally, two new species of planktonic nudibranchs were described (Quesquen 2017).\n119ZooKeys 1176: 117\u2013163 (2023), DOI: 10.3897/zookeys.1176.103167\nWe must emphasize that certain species have been listed in previous publications as occurring in Peru without sufficient evidence, such as assumptions of geographic continuity (e.g., Cadlina sparsa; \u00c1lamo and Valdivieso 1997), reliance on personal communications only (e.g., Polycera cf. alabe; Paredes et al. 1999; Uribe et al. 2013), and misinterpretations (e.g., Gargamella immaculata and Thecacera darwini; Nakamura 2006), which has created problems as these listings have persisted in the literature. To distinguish them from the confirmed species, the term \u201cpotentially occurring\u201d is used hereafter. However, such statuses can be revised in the future, as exemplified by the species Rostanga pulchra, which was initially predicted for Peruvian waters for many years until its confirmation (Schr\u00f6dl and Hooker 2014).\nEl Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) warm events have been observed to induce southward displacement of tropical species (Velez and Zeballos 1985; Paredes et al. 1998) while cold events tend to enhance the intensity of the Humboldt Current, resulting in the northward transport of larvae. Specifically, the northward transport of larvae by the Humboldt Current or the southward transport facilitated by warm ENSO events may introduce Magellanic or tropical species, respectively, into Peruvian waters, thereby influencing distribution ranges. In addition, the susceptibility of nudibranchs to temperature fluctuations, particularly during their larval stages (Leatherman 2019) due to the aragonite-based internal structure found in several species (Ehrlich 2010), their small body size, limited populations (Nybakken 1978), and the sensitivity of the Humboldt Current Ecosystem to oceanic stressors (Echevin et al. 2012) such as warming and acidification (Barnosky et al. 2011; Ceballos et al. 2015; Pievani 2014), collectively suggest that the diversity and distribution of nudibranchs could be impacted (Nimbs and Smith 2018).\nThe available information on Peruvian nudibranchs remains limited primarily due to a lack of research effort (Uribe and Pacheco 2012). Explorations specifically targeting nudibranchs have been extremely scarce, and most sightings and reports are sporadic (Nakamura 2006; Schr\u00f6dl and Hooker 2014; Uribe et al. 2013). Given that the species richness of nudibranchs is likely underestimated in Peru (Hooker pers. comm.), this taxonomic order warrants further attention. Our aim was to update and revise the list of nudibranchs in the Peruvian sea, based on a comprehensive review of the scientific literature."

The suborder Doridina consists of 15 species, distributed among five superfamilies and seven families (Table 1). Notably, the families Chromodorididae and Discodorididae, both belonging to the suborder Doridina, exhibit remarkable species richness with five and four species, respectively (Fig. 1).

(2013), based on mitochondrial and nuclear sequences, revealed that Spurilla neapolitana MacFarland, 1909 comprises a complex of five cryptic species. In the light of this discovery, the name Spurilla braziliana has been assigned to populations found in the western Atlantic and Pacific regions. Carmona et al. (2013) further speculated that the occurrence of this species in the Pacific Ocean might be attributed to human-mediated introductions."

Initially reported as Doris peruviana d\u2019Orbigny 1836, transferred to Platydoris Bergh, 1877 by Schr\u00f6dl (2003), who also included Bergh\u2019s (1898) description of P. punctatella as a junior synonym. Dorgan et al. (2002) ruled out that these reports were about a species belonging to Platydoris, based on a photograph of a live specimen (Schr\u00f6dl 1996a). Based on the description of the radular teeth, this species was transferred from Platydoris to the genus Baptodoris (Fischer and Cervera 2005a).

Orange Bay (55\u00b031'S), Nassau Bay, Chile (Vald\u00e9s and H\u00e9ros 1998). Distribution. From Juan L\u00f3pez, northern coast of Chile, to Strait of Magellan (Schr\u00f6dl 2003). Remarks. This species was listed by Nakamura (2006) based on Schr\u00f6dl (1999b), who listed this species as present in the Peruvian province, referring to Chilean waters. Fischer and Cervera (2005b) argued against its occurrence off the Chilean coast, although they acknowledge a high likelihood of its presence in Peruvian waters. Uribe et al. (2013) and Fischer (2006) referred to Zagal and Hermosilla\u2019s (2001) presumed finding of this species in Peru.\nGlaucus sp.\nHabitat. Pelagic. Type material. Not available. Distribution. Ica (Peru). Sampling/reporting sites. In Peru, Quesquen (2017) reported specimens twice off the coast of Ica in 1995 and 1998. Currently, the only valid species of the genus Glaucus is G. atlanticus, reported in Peru by Uribe et al. (2013) from Isla Santa, Ancash.\nRemarks. Quesquen (2017) offered a description of the specimens collected in Ica. He described a slender body that was ventrally flattened, with a small head and two cephalic tentacles. The dorsum was navy blue and green, and the ventral area was white. Additionally, the specimens had three or four branches on both sides of the body, and their body length could reach up to 43 mm. According to Vald\u00e9s and Campillo's (2004) description, G. atlanticus is characterized by its slim and elongated body, along with a small head and sleek oral tentacles and rhinophores. The coloration of its dorsum can vary from deep blue to brown hues. It possesses up to three groups of cerata, and its ventral region exhibits a silver shade.\nA confirmation of the taxonomic status of these specimens is necessary, using morphological and molecular analyses.\nAeolidia campbellii (Cunningham, 1871)\nHabitat. Benthic. Type material. ZSM 20020700 (Chile), designated as the neotype due to absence of the holotype (Kienberger et al. 2016). Distribution. Falkland Islands (50\u00b0S), Argentine and Chilean Patagonia (41\u00b0S) to Valparaiso (32\u00b0S) (Schr\u00f6dl 2003). In Peru, this species was listed by Paredes et al. (1999) as Aeolidia serotina Bergh, 1873 and replicated by Ram\u00edrez et al. (2003).\n146ZooKeys 1176: 117\u2013163 (2023), DOI: 10.3897/zookeys.1176.103167\nRemarks. It was reported off the coast of Chile by Schr\u00f6dl (2003) as Aeolidia papillosa (Linnaeus, 1761), later reassigned to the species A. campbellii according to molecular studies by Kienberger et al. (2016).\nGargamella immaculata Bergh, 1894 Common name: Unicolored Sea Lemon\nHabitat. Benthic. Type material. SMNH 1015\u2014Tierra del Fuego, Chile. Distribution. A common species on the southern coast of Chile and Argentina. Sampling/reporting sites. Cabo Metalqui, Chilo\u00e9 (Fischer and Cervera 2005b; Odhner 1926), in \u00daltima Esperanza, Tierra del Fuego (Marcus 1959), in Cabo San Antonio; Cabo Delgado; Gulf of Ancud, between Isla Quenu and Calbuco; Seno Otway, Queule and Coliumo Bay (Schr\u00f6dl 1996a). In Argentina, in the north (Bergh 1894; Odhner 1926), also in Argentine Patagonia and on the Burdwood Bank (Odhner 1926; Schr\u00f6dl 2003).\nRemarks. According to Schr\u00f6dl (2003), the Peruvian records of this species by Zagal and Hermosilla (2001) are doubtful. However, in that compilation and in the most up-to-date publication (Zagal and Hermosilla 2007), Gargamella immaculata is not mentioned from Peruvian waters, but as an inhabitant of the Peruvian zoogeographic province from Juan L\u00f3pez (Atacama) to the south. The species was mistakenly included in Kentrodorididae by Schr\u00f6dl (1996a), until Vald\u00e9s (2002) transferred it back to the Discodorididae.\nCadlina sparsa (Odhner, 1922) Common name: Dark-spot Cadlina\nHabitat. Benthic. Type locality. Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands and Desventuradas Islands, Chile (Odhner 1922). Distribution. It presents disjunct populations with a bipolar distribution in the eastern Pacific and an amphi-South American pattern. Sampling/reporting sites. In the Pacific, the northernmost location is Baja California (Behrens 1991; Jaeckle 1983) and the southernmost location is the Comau Fjord in southern Chile. In the Atlantic, it was recorded in Camarones Bay in the central region of Argentina (Schr\u00f6dl 2000, 2003). In Chile, it has also been sampled in the Juan Fern\u00e1ndez Islands (Odhner 1922), Chilo\u00e9 Islands (Marcus 1959), and Coliumo Bay (Schr\u00f6dl 1996a, 2003).\nRemarks. Cadlina sparsa was initially proposed as probable species in Peruvian water by \u00c1lamo and Valdivieso (1997). Subsequently, its presence was consistently mentioned in the lists compiled by Paredes et al. (1999), Ram\u00edrez et al. (2003), and Nakamura (2006). However, no actual specimens have been collected from intermediate Pacific locations, including Peru. Despite the absence of direct observations, a hypothetical distribution for Peru has been predicted through extrapolation, assuming a continuous geographic range (Uribe et al. 2013).\n147ZooKeys 1176: 117\u2013163 (2023), DOI: 10.3897/zookeys.1176.103167\nStudies have demonstrated that C. sparsa does not fall within the family Chromodorididae, as initially suggested (Johnson 2011), but rather belongs to the family Cadlinidae. However, there have been no other revisions or updates regarding its scientific name. The taxonomy of the genera involved has been thoroughly elucidated in previous literature (Schr\u00f6dl 2000).\nPolycera cf. alabe Collier & Farmer, 1964\nHabitat. Benthic. Type material. CASIZ 18190\u2014Cedros Island, Baja California (28\u00b012'13\"N, 115\u00b015'28\"W), Mexico. Distribution. From Baja California (Behrens 2004; Behrens and Hermosillo 2005; Camacho-Garc\u00eda et al. 2005), Puerto Vallarta (20\u00b040'N) in Mexico to Costa Rica (Behrens 2004); and northern Chile with a single isolated record (Schr\u00f6dl 2003).\nRemarks. In Peru, Paredes et al. (1999) listed this species as Polycera cf. alabe, likely based on information obtained through personal communication with Sandra Millen. Subsequently, Uribe et al. (2013) included this species in their listing, also citing personal communication with Sandra Millen, who observed this species at El Rubio (Tumbes).\nPhylliroe lichtensteinii Eschscholtz, 1825\nHabitat. Pelagic. Type material. Not available. Distribution. Cosmopolitan (Padula 2015). Sampling/reporting sites. Espiritu Santo, southeastern Brazil (Ralph 1959). Remarks. For Peru, the species was listed in Ram\u00edrez et al. (2003). There are no reports of collections of this species in Peruvian waters.\nItaxia falklandica (Eliot, 1907)\nHabitat. Benthic. Depth. 1\u201315 m (Schr\u00f6dl 1996a). Type material. Not available. Distribution. Abundant in the Magellanic Province, in the Southeast Pacific (Aldea et al. 2011; Velasco\u2010Charpentier et al. 2021) and with records in the South Atlantic (Eliot 1907; Odhner 1926, 1944), Pacific Ocean (Marcus 1959; Meyers-Mu\u00f1oz et al. 2009; Schr\u00f6dl 1996a, 2003), and Indian Ocean (Odhner 1944).\nRemarks. It was included in the list of mollusks of Peru by Paredes et al. (1999) as Flabellina falklandica (Eliot 1907); this information was repeated by Ram\u00edrez et al. (2003).\nAccording to Uribe et al. (2013), its presence in Peru requires confirmation since the inclusion by Paredes et al. (1999) was based on unfounded records.\n148ZooKeys 1176: 117\u2013163 (2023), DOI: 10.3897/zookeys.1176.103167\nCoryphellina marcusorum (Gosliner & Kuzirian, 1990) Common name: Marcus\u2019s Aeolid\nHabitat.

From Brazil to Gulf of California (Mexico) (Gosliner and Kuzirian 1990; Fischer et al. 2007). Sampling/reporting sites. In Peru, this species was recently photographed in Los Organos (Piura, 04\u00b010\u2032S) on 11 March 2022 (Torrej\u00f3n 2023). Remarks. Originally named Flabellina marcusorum Gosliner & Kuzirian, 1990. Its presence in Peru needs be confirmed by future surveys."

The revised and updated scientific names are presented, while species not verified or erroneously listed in previous articles, referred to here as \u2019potentially occurring\u2019, are separated from those confirmed.\nDespite the presence of two distinct coastal marine biogeographic provinces and a transitional zone between them (Schr\u00f6dl and Hooker 2014; Ibanez-Erquiaga et al. 2018; Barahona et al. 2019), the species richness of nudibranchs remains relatively low (n = 31) compared to other marine regions, such as the Gulf of Mexico, the Caribbean, the South Atlantic, the Indian Ocean, and the Mediterranean Sea (Behrens 2004; Chavanich et al. 2013). In neighboring South American countries, such as Colombia (n > 40) (Ardila et al. 2007; Londo\u00f1o-Cruz 202 1), Chile (n > 50) (Schr\u00f6dl 1996a, 1999b, 2003; Fischer and Cervera 2005b; Schr\u00f6dl et al. 2005; Schr\u00f6dl and Grau 2006; Aldea et al. 2011), and Brazil (n > 80) (Marcus and Marcus 1969; Padula et al. 2011; Pereira et al. 2012; Padula 2015), a greater diversity of nudibranch species is found (Fig. 3A, B).\nIt is worth noting that there are areas along the Peruvian coast that remain unexplored. In the Tropical Eastern Pacific, only a limited number of locations have been sampled, including Pocitas, Punta Sal, Mancora, and Cancas. Within the transition zone, Sechura Bay and Foca Island are the common reporting sites, while within the Warm Temperate Southeastern Pacific, Santa, Casma, Huarmey (Ancash), Ancon, Callao, San Lorenzo Island, Pucusana (Lima), Pisco, Independencia Bay, San Juan de Marcona (Ica), Matarani, and Isla Blanca (Arequipa) are frequently mentioned. Factors such as limited exploration efforts, challenging diving conditions, a scarcity of nudibranch taxonomists, and a general lack of interest in this group in Peru should be highlighted. In addition, it is highly likely that several species remain unreported and undescribed, particularly in deeper waters. Therefore, the confirmed number of nudibranch species in Peruvian waters (n = 31) is presumed to represent only a fraction of the actual diversity present.\n149ZooKeys 1176: 117\u2013163 (2023), DOI: 10.3897/zookeys.1176.103167"

            "text": "Several confirmed species exhibit a biogeographical affinity for the Warm Temperate Southeastern Pacific (n = 23) (Fig. 2). The Humboldt Current plays a significant role as an oceanographic factor, facilitating the influx of various species from the Chilean sea into Peruvian waters, with 19 of them occurring in both. For instance, Phidiana lottini, found in Callao and Puerto Malabrigo, may extend into tropical waters due to the influence of the Humboldt Current (Uribe et al. 2013). The occurrence of Polycera priva in Peru came as a surprise to researchers, considering that this species is typically Magellanic and endemic to the Patagonian fjords (Schr\u00f6dl 1996a, 1999b, 2003, 2009). Therefore, its presence in Peru is attributed to the influence of the Humboldt Current (Schr\u00f6dl 1996a, 1999b, 2003, 2009; Schr\u00f6dl and Hooker 2014). Species such as Corambe lucea, Coryphellina cerverai, Janolus rebeccae, and Tritonia sp., collected in the Warm Temperate Southeastern Pacific province, have also been reported in Sechura Bay and Foca Island, situated in the biogeographical transition zone. This suggests their adaptation to slightly warmer waters (Fig. 4).\nEl Ni\u00f1o events can induce shifts in the distribution ranges of sea slugs (Goddard et al. 2018) and even result in species turnover (Valqui et al. 2021). During strong El Ni\u00f1o events, it is noteworthy that mollusk species endemic to tropical areas have been observed in Peruvian waters due to the displacement of warm-water masses (Velez and Zeballos 1985; Paredes et al. 1998; Ram\u00edrez et al. 2003). Species such as Armina californica, Felimida baumanni, Felimare agassizii, Tyrinna evelinae, and Bajaeolis bertschi, which are abundant in the Tropical Eastern Pacific province, Warm Temperate Northeast Pacific, or Cold Temperate Northeast Pacific, have only been recorded in Tumbes or Piura (the northernmost coastal areas of Peru) (Table 4). This suggests that their presence may be temporary, resulting from the displacement of warm-water masses, or they may have permanently adapted to similar conditions following multiple El Ni\u00f1o events (Ashton et al. 2008).\nThe distribution patterns of cosmopolitan and circumglobal species can be attributed to various biological factors, including their remarkable dispersal capabilities. Take, for instance, Glaucus atlanticus, which possesses intriguing adaptations for dispersal such as larval gas bubbles and specialized anatomy enabling it to exploit water surface tension (Thompson and McFarlane 1967; Vald\u00e9s and Campillo 2004; Churchill et al. 2014a). Additionally, abiotic factors like ocean currents (Miller 1993) and indirect human influences such as buoy rafting (Astudillo et al. 2009), ballast water, or shipping activities can facilitate the dispersal of these species, expanding their geographic ranges (Borg et al. 2009)."

One notable example is Cadlina sparsa. Initially mentioned as a probable species by Alamo and Valdivieso (1997), it persisted in the subsequent publications of Paredes et al. (1999), Ram\u00edrez et al.\n150ZooKeys 1176: 117\u2013163 (2023), DOI: 10.3897/zookeys.1176.103167\n(2003), and Nakamura (2006) without acknowledging its speculative status. In the work of Uribe et al. (2013), the authors discussed the predicted occurrence of Cadlina sparsa in Peruvian waters based on extrapolation, assuming a continuous distribution, due to its presence in Baja California and Chile.\nParedes et al. (1999), based on personal communication with Sandra Millen, included Aeolidia campbellii (referred to as Aeolidia serotina) and Itaxia falklandica (referred to as Flabellina falklandica), which persisted in the subsequent lists of Nakamura (2006) and Ram\u00edrez et al. (2003), respectively. However, no additional published reports have surfaced to substantiate their presence. Ram\u00edrez et al. (2003) also included the species Phylliroe lichtensteinii without providing any justification for its inclusion. On the other hand, Nakamura (2006) mistakenly listed Gargamella immaculata and Thecacera darwini as present in Peruvian waters, referencing Schr\u00f6dl (1999b). Nevertheless, Schr\u00f6dl (1999b) only listed these species in a table as occurring in the \u2018zoogeographic Peruvian province\u2019, indicating their presence in the Chilean waters corresponding to this biogeographical province, but not in Peruvian waters.\nA solitary specimen of Coryphellina marcusorum was recently documented through photography on the northern coast of Peru (Los Organos, Piura) (Torrej\u00f3n 2023). Given the species\u2019 tropical distribution and a previous record near countries such as Ecuador (GBIF 2022), its occurrence in Peru is plausible. However, these two records do not provide evidence of an established population in this region, suggesting the possibility that it may have arrived independently through shipping or been displaced by ocean currents. Further collections and taxonomic verifications are necessary to confirm its presence definitively.\nPotentially occurring species should not be included in the official list of Peruvian nudibranch species. However, considering their disjointed or patchy geographic distributions or unique observations, they may be reported in Peruvian waters in forthcoming papers. Rostanga pulchra, for instance, was a long-standing predicted species for Peruvian waters until its initial sighting in San Juan de Marcona (Ica) by Schr\u00f6dl and Hooker (2014). As a cosmopolitan species, the presence of Phylliroe lichtensteinii in Peru is plausible. Fischer and Cervera (2005b) have deemed the presence of Thecacera darwini in Peruvian waters highly probable. The term \u201cpotentially occurring\u201d signifies a provisional status, indicating that these species have not yet been officially confirmed."

Considering that P. alabe was solely \u201cobserved\u201d by Millen in Tumbes, it is possible that it represents another Polycera species, such as P. anae, given its inclusion in a species complex (Santander and Vald\u00e9s 2013).\nThe report of Glaucus sp., documented by Quesquen (2017), is based on a single poorly preserved specimen sampled in 1995, warranting verification\n151ZooKeys 1176: 117\u2013163 (2023), DOI: 10.3897/zookeys.1176.103167\nthrough molecular methods. Currently, within the genus Glaucus, only the species G. atlanticus has been confirmed, as many previous records turned out to be synonyms (e.g., G. distichoicus) or were later reassigned to the genus Glaucilla. Similar circumstances apply to the reports of Tritonia sp. and Cuthona sp., as their species-level recognition is still pending."

It is imperative to intensify monitoring efforts to verify the presence of doubtful species, evaluate anthropogenic impacts, and El Ni\u00f1o-driven displacements. Furthermore, considering the intricate nature of external morphological identification, frequent variability in coloration, and the probable existence of cryptic species, it is possible that a considerable number of species remain undiscovered. Consequently, there is an urgent need for comprehensive research involving detailed internal anatomy and the application of molecular tools, such as DNA barcoding and phylogenetic analyses. These methodologies will play a vital role in shedding light on the taxonomy and evolutionary relationships within this group."
