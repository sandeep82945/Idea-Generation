    "abstractText": "Linear oscillatory motion of domain walls (DWs) in the kHz and MHz regime is crucial when realizing precise magnetic field sensors such as giant magnetoimpedance devices. Numerous magnetically active defects lead to pinning of the DWs during their motion, affecting the overall behavior. Thus, the direct monitoring of the domain wall\u2019s oscillatory behavior is an important step to comprehend the underlying micromagnetic processes and to improve the magnetoresistive performance of these devices. Here, we report an imaging approach to investigate such DW dynamics with nanoscale spatial resolution employing conventional table-top microscopy techniques. Time-averaged magnetic force microscopy and Kerr imaging methods are applied to quantify the DW oscillations in Ni81Fe19 rectangular structures with Landau domain configuration and are complemented by numeric micromagnetic simulations. We study the oscillation amplitude as a function of external magnetic field strength, frequency, magnetic structure size, thickness and anisotropy and understand the excited DW behavior as a forced damped harmonic oscillator with restoring force being influenced by the geometry, thickness, and anisotropy of the Ni81Fe19 structure. This approach offers new possibilities for the analysis of DW motion at elevated frequencies and at a spatial resolution of well below 100 nm in various branches of nanomagnetism.",

Schmidt*b,e,f\nLinear oscillatory motion of domain walls (DWs) in the kHz and MHz regime is crucial when realizing\nprecise magnetic field sensors such as giant magnetoimpedance devices. Numerous magnetically active\ndefects lead to pinning of the DWs during their motion, affecting the overall behavior. Thus, the direct\nmonitoring of the domain wall\u2019s oscillatory behavior is an important step to comprehend the underlying\nmicromagnetic processes and to improve the magnetoresistive performance of these devices. Here, we\nreport an imaging approach to investigate such DW dynamics with nanoscale spatial resolution employing\nconventional table-top microscopy techniques. Time-averaged magnetic force microscopy and Kerr\nimaging methods are applied to quantify the DW oscillations in Ni81Fe19 rectangular structures with Landau domain configuration and are complemented by numeric micromagnetic simulations. We study\nthe oscillation amplitude as a function of external magnetic field strength, frequency, magnetic structure\nsize, thickness and anisotropy and understand the excited DW behavior as a forced damped harmonic\noscillator with restoring force being influenced by the geometry, thickness, and anisotropy of the Ni81Fe19 structure. This approach offers new possibilities for the analysis of DW motion at elevated frequencies and\nat a spatial resolution of well below 100 nm in various branches of nanomagnetism.\nIntroduction\nInvestigation of the domain wall (DW) oscillation behavior has provided deep insight in various areas of applied magnetism, e.g., the understanding of the giant magneto-impedance effect,1\u20134 the dynamic magnetization processes relevant to minimize core losses in soft magnetic electrical transformer sheets5\u20138 and the functionality of magnetophoretic devices based on DW motion.9\u201313 Maximum velocity, mobility, mass, pinning and linearity of a DW motion are properties of major relevance in the responsiveness of DW based sensors and devices. The first three properties have been mainly studied by imaging the DW displacement after applying a dc-bias pulse,14\u201319 and by selected experiments on probing the resonance frequency of a pinned DW,20\u201323 but there is a lack of information on the real-time behavior of an ac-excited DW, including effects of pinning and linearity, due to limits in the state of the art of experimental techniques to characterize the precise in situ movement of a DW. Hence, development of a high spatial resolution imaging method to investigate the trajectory of the ac-excited DW is important for advancing magnetic sensor technology24 as well as for understanding fundamental DW properties.\nThe response of a domain wall or vortex to high frequency (>MHz) ac-excitations has been studied employing time-resolved imaging using X-ray-,22,25,26 Lorentz-27 and Kerr microscopy.28\u201330 However, imaging the trajectory of a domain wall with a timeresolved technique is an extremely challenging task. Additionally, imaging with the first two microscopy techniques requires X-ray- or electron beam-transparent substrates, and Kerr microscopy is limited by its moderate resolution in the micrometer range. In the kHz frequency region and below, DW dynamics has been explored by measuring the complex permeability (an averaged property of the sample) by means of the magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE)31\u201333 and by magnetoimpedance measurements.4,34\u201336 In this approach, DW velocities and mobilities are extracted from the measured permeability as a function of excitation field amplitude and frequency. \u2020Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available.

Few reports are the early measurements of the write head fields in the MHz regime39\u201341 and the more recent development of sideband MFM.42 In both cases, MFM is used for a successful mapping of temporal field dynamics, but not for imaging oscillatory spatial DW processes.\nIn this work, we developed two direct imaging methods based on conventional table-top magnetic force microscopy (MFM) \u2013 real-time and time-averaged imaging to investigate the DW\u2019s oscillation trajectory in the range of millihertz (mHz) and kilohertz (kHz) frequencies, respectively. We take advantage of MFM\u2019s high spatial resolution and quantify the DW dynamic oscillation amplitude down to 60 nm and thus eliminate the need of challenging time-resolved imaging methods, special sample preparation and complex equipment. To extend our studies to larger oscillation amplitudes, time-averaged imaging using Kerr microscopy is performed. In that Kerr imaging approach, valuable information can be obtained by regular difference-image processing,43 which is robust, easy and fast to perform.\nIn the case of real-time MFM imaging, the MFM tip records the DW position in quasi-static mode, as in that case DW moves rather slowly (frequency of few tens of mHz) in comparison to the tip\u2019s scan speed (frequency of a few Hz).\nThe basic principle of the second imaging method, i.e., timeaveraged MFM imaging, is summarized in Fig. 1. In case of a static DW (Fig. 1a1), the DW\u2019s spatial position does not change with time, so the dwell time function of the DW, tD, i.e. the time spent by the domain wall at a given position, peaks at the static DW position (Fig. 1b1). For a sinusoidally excited DW (Fig. 1a2 and a3), the periodicity of ac excitation strictly defines the DW position (\u221d B) and DW velocity (\u221d dB/dt ). Due to the positiondependent DW velocity, the dwell time function (Fig. 1b2 and b3) depends on the position of the DW with respect to its static position. For DW oscillation frequencies (in kHz) much higher\nthan the MFM tip\u2019s scan speed (0.1 Hz), the DW interaction felt by the tip is averaged at a given position and therefore scales with the dwell time tD. The MFM signal thus contains the corresponding information of the DW oscillation\u2019s trajectory and amplitudes. Using these imaging methods, together with a quantitative analysis, we studied the DW dynamics of soft ferromagnetic permalloy rectangles in the Landau domain configuration as a function of excitation strength, frequency, structure size, thickness and strain induced magnetic anisotropy (along the long axis) of the rectangle. Soft ferromagnetic permalloy (Ni81Fe19) rectangles have been chosen due to the well-known Landau structure ground state (with stable 180\u00b0 domain wall) and the material\u2019s high permeability,44 which is therefore suitable for periodic domain wall dynamics.\nResults and discussion"

With a cantilever scan rate of 1.0 Hz (along the fast scan axis, i.e., the x-axis), which is 100 times faster than the domain wall oscillation frequency, each scan line in the MFM image records the profile of the quasi-static DW with the DW position depending on the momentary field value. The sinusoidal DW oscillation is thus directly seen in the recorded MFM image with an oscillation period T = 100 s and the peak-to-peak oscillation amplitude can be simply extracted from the displacement in the line scans that correspond to opposite return points. As expected, the oscillation amplitude xamp (i.e. half of the peak-to-peak amplitude) varies linearly with the peak ac-field amplitude \u00b50Hy (Fig. 2g, green open symbols).

View Article Online\ncontrast (imaged by keeping the \u2018slow scan axis\u2019 disabled) of the static and dynamically oscillating DW, respectively. With a cantilever scan rate of 0.1 Hz (along the fast x-scan axis), which is 104 times smaller than the DW oscillation frequency (1 kHz), even within the acquisition time of one pixel the DW performs several periods of motion. The MFM tip thus senses the time-averaged phase change signal proportional to the time that the DW is present at that position. In the case of a sinusoidal DW oscillation, due to position dependent DW velocities, this so-called dwell time is also position dependent and consequently the longest tip-DW interaction appears as two darker vertical lines at the return points (or amplitude) of the DW oscillation (Fig. 2d). The intensity profile of this measurement (obtained by averaging the line contrast along the y-axis) is superposed onto the image as a magenta dotted line. The two minima in the intensity signal represent the peak positions of the oscillating DW. This intensity profile is furthermore plotted in Fig. 2f together with a measurement at \u00b50Hy = 0.064 mT (blue dotted line) and zero excitation field (red dotted line). The signal from the static DW presents the regular MFM interaction between the magnetic tip and the DW stray fields. As the excitation amplitude becomes nonzero, the DW signal first becomes broader (shown in ESI, Fig. S2 and ESI Note 2\u2020) and then splits into the observed two minima. If the excitation amplitude is further increased, the peak positions move further apart and the minima become shallower.\nFor a quantitative analysis of such an intensity profile the dwell time is derived as a function of DW position along the x-direction according to Fig. 2e, where DW oscillations are assumed to be purely periodic and sinusoidal. Periodicity of the process is assumed on the basis of the periodic excitation. For a certain position xi along the scan line, the DW contributes to the signal when it stays at this position xi within the limits of the pixel size \u0394x. This is illustrated in Fig. 2e for two positions x1 and x2. At position x1, close to the return point of the DW, dwell time is significantly longer whereas at x2, close to the equilibrium position, the fast moving DW causes the tip to only briefly interact with the DW within the pixel acquisition time. The dwell time, tD is expressed as\ntD\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc \u00bdsin 1\u00f0b=xamp\u00de sin 1\u00f0a=xamp\u00de =\u03c0 \u00f01a\u00de\nwhich is normalized by the period of oscillation T. xamp is the peak amplitude of the DW oscillation and the limits, a and b, are given by\na \u00bc max\u00f0x \u0394x=2; xamp\u00de; b \u00bc min\u00f0x\u00fe \u0394x=2; xamp\u00de: \u00f01b\u00de\nAs the MFM contrast of a magnetic object is necessarily broadened, the MFM signal recorded from the oscillating DW is finally the convolution45 of the static MFM profile with the above normalized dwell time function:\nMFMac\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc MFMstatic\u00f0x\u00de tD\u00f0x; xamp\u00de \u00f02\u00de\nThe solid black lines in Fig. 2f are the convolved signals (using eqn (2)), based on the measured static MFM profile and\nwith only the oscillation amplitude xamp as a free fitting parameter. Details on the intensity model and the fitting procedure are given in the ESI, Fig. S3 and ESI Note 3.\u2020 Apparently, all experimental features are well described by the model, confirming the assumptions of periodicity, sinusoidal DW movement and the ansatz of a time-averaged phase shift signal. The oscillation amplitude xamp as a function of \u00b50Hy is seen in Fig. 2h as a separate panel and in Fig. 2g together with the quasi-static data, in good agreement despite the largely different excitation frequencies. Besides confirming the linear increase of xamp with \u00b50Hy, these measurements in the small field regime allow a precise determination of the depinning field Hp from the intercept with the abscissa. Below a value of \u00b50Hp = 0.05 mT, DW movement is suppressed due to pinning, supposedly mainly caused by pinning of the Blochlines which occur at the cross-tie walls. As seen from Fig. 2i, the excitation frequency has almost no influence on the oscillation amplitude at fixed field amplitude (\u00b50Hy = 0.096 mT). An inherent feature of the time-averaged signal for sinusoidal oscillations is that the signal strength continuously decreases with increasing oscillation amplitude. The time-averaged MFM approach can thus best be used under the following conditions: (i) oscillation amplitudes at or below the micrometer range, where one can also take advantage of the high MFM resolution; (ii) large static DW signal for good signal-to-noise ratio; (iii) magnetic materials with low pinning and easy domain wall movement for an instantaneous relaxation into the field dependent equilibrium position."

Fig. 3a shows the Landau pattern in the zero field state,46 which was obtained after an ac-field demagnetizing procedure. The bright and dark areas in Fig. 3a resemble the magnetic domains, aligned parallel and anti-parallel to the long axis. Additional weak contrast within these domains arises from the cross-tie walls, which are expected for permalloy films with the given thickness. The imaging of DW oscillations was performed with a typical exposure time of 6.4 s (i.e., multiple oscillations within that time are averaged), with an image of the original zero-field Landau state (Fig. 3a) being subtracted. A typical difference image, obtained by that procedure for a field amplitude of 0.40 mT and a frequency of 1 kHz, is shown in Fig. 3b.\nIn the dynamically averaged difference image (i.e., timeaveraged image obtained after background subtraction and acfield application, Fig. 3b), due to DW motion the domain areas that do not grow or shrink, stay gray, while parts with alternating magnetization show up as contrast. A bright difference contrast to the right side is the result of the growing bright domain during the positive cycle of excitation. Similarly, the dark contrast to the left side is the result of the growing dark domain during the negative cycle of excitation. Thus, the change of contrast contains information about the DW movement and especially its maximum displacement"

The intensity profile across the 180\u00b0 DW is superposed onto the image. Such intensity profiles of dynamically averaged difference images captured at different excitation field values (at a constant excitation frequency of 1 kHz) are plotted as solid colored symbols in Fig. 3c. The intensity at a given position on the x-axis scales with the average time the magnetic domain extended beyond that position during the oscillation. This is illustrated in Fig. 3d, where the sinusoidal DW movement is plotted in a time-position diagram and the respective time (dwell time) is sketched as a blue line for two different positions x1 and x2. Obviously, at position x1 close to the equilibrium (x = 0), the DW spends a large time interval \u0394t1 beyond x1, while at x2 (close to the return point) the DW enters the region at and beyond x2 only during a short time interval \u0394t2 where it contributes to the measured difference image. Apart from being determined by the length of the time interval, the intensity changes also sign with the sign of x. Furthermore, due to the spatial extension of the DW signal (given by the optical resolution \u0394x), the intensity is given by the integral across the resolution width of the sign-weighted dwell time.

The DW oscillation amplitude increases linearly with the field amplitude \u00b50Hy, while it displays no significant dependence (within the error bars) on the excitation frequency in the studied range from 100 Hz to 1 kHz. With respect to the magnetooptical signal detection, the time-averaged measurement approach involves no upper limit concerning the DW oscillation amplitude and frequency, however, we are limited to excitation frequencies of 1 kHz due to restrictions of the power supply and the inductance of the field coils.\nOur observations indicate that even at fac = 1 kHz the DW is still instantaneously following the excitation field. Studies performed by Kerr susceptometry on Co2MnGe\n33 and Co32 stripes report dependencies of the DW oscillation amplitude on both, excitation amplitude and frequency. For a fixed excitation amplitude, the DW oscillation amplitude varies with excitation frequency. For instance, at a field value close to the coercive field of the magnetic structure, the DW oscillation amplitude starts to decrease above a cutoff frequency (which is around 28\u201338 Hz and 1500\u20133700 Hz, depending on the field value applied in Co2MnGe and Co stripes, respectively) and reduces to zero on further increase in excitation frequency. The cutoff frequency is linked to the DW mobility, which is deduced from the experiment to be 11 m s\u22121 mT\u22121 for the 60 nm thick Co2MnGe film and 150 m s\n\u22121 mT\u22121 for the 40 nm thick Co film. These results suggest, that in our 50 nm thick permalloy structures, for which a DW mobility around 100 m s\u22121 mT\u22121 is expected,47,48 the DW amplitudes up to 1 kHz excitation frequency should not decay with frequency, which agrees with the experimental observation. It further indicated, that the DW dynamics in permalloy rectangles in the applied field and frequency range occurs in the flow regime.\nInfluence of structure size and thickness: experiments\nTo develop a better understanding of the DW dynamics in permalloy rectangles, two additional rectangles of different dimensions were prepared, and the DW dynamics was analyzed by means of the time-averaged MFM and Kerr imaging\n(Fig. 4). Compared to the structure (rectangle 1) with edge length L = 50 \u00b5m and permalloy thickness d = 50 nm (discussed so far), rectangle 2 has a film thickness of d = 20 nm. Rectangle 3 maintains the thickness of 20 nm but with a reduced edge length of L = 30 \u00b5m (microscopic images of rectangles 2 and 3 are shown in ESI, Fig. S1\u2020). After ac-demagnetization, rectangles 2 and 3 reveal the Landau ground state with 180\u00b0 domain walls, but without crossties, in agreement with the reduced thickness.46 According to Fig. 4a, the geometry has a decisive effect on the oscillation amplitude,49,50 with a strong increase in xamp with decreasing film thickness (compare rectangle 1 and 2) and a strong decrease in xamp for reduced planar dimensions (compare rectangle 2 and 3). The depinning fields for the thin rectangles 2 and 3 are similar (\u00b50Hp \u2245 0.02 mT) and smaller than for rectangle 1 (\u00b50Hp \u2245 0.05 mT). Concerning the dynamic behavior, the oscillation amplitude is independent of excitation frequency up to 1 kHz, as seen in Fig. 4b measured by MFM and Kerr microscopy for rectangles 1 and 3 at two different excitation field amplitudes \u00b50Hy.\nA simple argument for the increasing amplitude xamp with increased edge length L is as follows: a given field \u00b50Hy applied to the permalloy rectangle will roughly lead to the same normalized net magnetization my, irrespective of the structure size. Thus, the structure with larger width (W = L/2) will allow a larger absolute DW displacement.49,50 This, however, cannot explain the increase in xamp with decreasing film thickness d. A full explanation needs to consider the true magnetization configuration and its energy terms, including the demagnetization energy and exchange energy contained in the fielddependent domain pattern and the domain walls.\nInfluence of structure size and thickness: micromagnetic simulation\nThe quasi-static DW dynamics was simulated by performing numeric micromagnetic simulations in permalloy rectangles.

View Article Online\ndynamics, simulations are performed starting from rectangles with dimensions almost 10 times smaller (due to limitations in computing power) up to the dimensions of the smallest experimentally realized rectangle (rectangle 3). The chosen dimensions for simulation are sufficiently large to replicate the experimental observed domain configuration, except for the cross-tie walls, which are absent also in the thickest (52 nm) simulated rectangle. For analyzing DW dynamics, magnetic domain configurations were obtained at different applied fields \u00b50Hy, and the DW displacement was analyzed. When staying below a net magnetization my < 0.5, the amplitude (displacement) increased linearly with \u00b50Hy, as observed in the experiments (shown in ESI, Fig. S5a and b\u2020). The DW displacement at a constant field \u00b50Hy = 0.1 mT is plotted as a function of edge length L and thickness d in Fig. 5a and b, respectively. In Fig. 5a, simulations were performed for permalloy structures with 20 nm thickness and edge lengths L from ranging from 3.7 \u00b5m to 30 \u00b5m, and the displacement (amplitude) clearly increases with L as also seen in the experiment. The data can be described by a power law xamp \u221d Lp, with an exponent p = 2.09. Due to limited computer memory it was not possible to perform the simulations for L = 50 \u00b5m and thus the fitted power law was extrapolated to 50 \u00b5m length (red solid line in Fig. 5a). In Fig. 5b, simulations are summarized for rectangles of fixed size (L = 5.6 \u00b5m) but various thicknesses between 12 and 52 nm. As observed in the experiment, the DW displacement for a fixed field decreases with thickness. The data can be described by an inverse power function xamp \u221d d\u2212p, with exponent p = 0.81. Besides this qualitative comparison, which confirms the observed dependency on the pattern geometry, the simulations displayed in Fig. 5a also allow a direct quantitative comparison with the experiment. The experimentally determined dynamic amplitudes xamp at f = 1 kHz for the two 20 nm thick rectangles with L = 30 \u00b5m and 50 \u00b5m are included in the graph and match the static simulations well (maximum error of 7.5%). This again corroborates, that the DW instantaneously follows the externally applied field, and that apart from the small effect of the depinning field the DW displacement in this frequency range is not influenced by details of the microstructure of the material. This is certainly a consequence of the \u2018self-sustaining\u2019 domain configuration of the Landau pattern, where the equilibrium position in a given field is determined solely by the gain in Zeeman energy versus the costs of an increased exchange and demagnetization energy. With an appropriate estimation of the latter, a simple energy approach can lead to a complete description of the studied domain structure.\nFig. 5 Micromagnetic OOMMF simulation of quasi-static DW dynamics for permalloy rectangles of different geometry.

This parameter is plotted in Fig. 5c as a function of edge length L and shows a hyperbolic decay according to c \u221d L\u22121.03. The corresponding analysis for varying film thickness is displayed in the Fig. 5d and leads to a stiffness parameter c \u221d d0.84, varying roughly linearly with thickness.\nThe equilibrium DW position, xamp, is then derived from minimizing the total energy density (see ESI, Note 5\u2020), and reads:\nxamp \u00bc \u03bc0Ms8\u03b2 : L c :H \u00f05\u00de\nThe factor \u03b2 corrects for the closure domains with transverse magnetization. This final expression (eqn (5)) contains the linear dependence of xamp on H, and also an explicit linear dependence on the edge length L, which we discussed already with the experimental observation. The details of the geometry are contained in the stiffness parameter c. The hyperbolic decay c \u221d L\u22121.03 largely explains the numerically observed dependency xamp \u221d L2.09.

View Article Online\nInfluence of magnetic anisotropy: experiments and micromagnetic simulations\nAn additional energy density term that plays an important role in DW dynamics is the uniaxial magnetic anisotropy (UMA). It can be induced in a soft ferromagnetic material by several means.51\u201354 In this work, we induce a UMA parallel to the long axis of the permalloy rectangle by depositing the element on a recently developed shapeable polymeric platform for controlling sign and magnitude of the elastic strain.51 A polymeric platform stack of sacrificial layer (SL), polyimide layer (PI) and hydrogel layer (HG) is prepared (Fig. 6a1), where the hydrogel (HG) will swell in an alkaline solution against the retaining force of the PI. This will lead to a rolling down of the polymer platform, once it is released from the substrate by etching the SL (Fig. 6b1 and b2). The 20 nm thick permalloy on top experiences a positive (tensile) stress (\u03c3 > 0) along the rolling direction, i.e. perpendicular to the rectangle\u2019s long axis (see ESI, Fig. S6 and ESI Note 6\u2020). With a residual negative magnetostriction (\u03bb < 0) value of Ni81Fe19 and according to the equation of magnetoelastic energy constant,55 Ku = (3/2)\u03c3\u03bb, the straininduced uniaxial anisotropy is negative and thus lies perpendicular to the strain direction, i.e., along the long rectangle edge. In the unrolled state the rectangle reduces the magnetostatic energy by conforming to the shape of the structures,56 i.e. by forming the already discussed Landau pattern (Fig. 6a2i). After being self-assembled in a roll-down fashion, the Kerr image Fig. 6b3-i shows an increase of the area of the already existing domains oriented along the long axis, and thus parallel to the induced UMA. The DW dynamics was analyzed by means of the time-averaged Kerr imaging technique.\nThe increase in oscillation amplitude after rolling is immediately visible by comparing the time-averaged dynamic difference images to those of the unrolled structure (Fig. 6a2-ii and b3-ii). A quantitative comparison for several field amplitudes is shown in Fig. 6c. The strain-induced axial magnetic anisotropy obviously favors the DW oscillation and increases its amplitude, in agreement with earlier studies based on global permeability measurements.57\nMicromagnetic calculations for a rectangular structure with L = 5632 nm and d = 20 nm confirm that for a fixed field value the DW displacement increases monotonously with induced UMA (Fig. 6d). Also, for this scenario an energy ansatz is able to explain the observed and simulated behavior, now with a modified stiffness parameter c\u2032 (see ESI, Fig. S7 and ESI Note 7\u2020 for modified equations). The reduced stiffness (and thus restoring force) in case of an additional UMA enables the larger oscillation amplitudes.\nConclusions\nWe developed a new approach for the direct imaging of periodic DW oscillations with nanoscale resolution using conventional MFM, and complemented these experiments on permalloy Landau structures with Kerr microscopy observations for oscillation amplitudes of micrometers and above. By means of\nan analytical dwell-time theory and including the convolution principle of MFM image formation we are able to model timeaveraged MFM data and consequently determined DW oscillations for amplitudes down to 60 nm. In our current experimental ac-field setup, we are limited to frequencies of 1 kHz (due to an increase in coil\u2019s inductance and hence reduction in field amplitude at higher frequencies), but we do expect the method to work in a much larger frequency range, as long as the domain wall motion remains periodic and the detected phase signal averages during the integration time defined by tip speed and pixel size. The method however fails in the frequency range close to the resonance frequency f0 of the cantilever, as there a more complex direct excitation of the cantilever will largely modify the measurement scheme. The developed dynamic imaging approach can be applied to any thin-film sample with well-defined zero-field DW equilibrium position and a displacement-dependent restoring force, in order to oscillate the DW periodically and repetitively. Although not tested experimentally in this work, deviations from a non-sinusoidal DW motion are expected to be detectable in the shape of the time-averaged MFM profile. To hint at this additional strength of the method, in Fig. S8 and Note 8 of the ESI,\u2020 the dwell time functions of periodic triangular and square-shaped DW movements are displayed. They clearly differ from that of a sinusoidal DW motion, and again bear a clear signature of the oscillation amplitude. A similar dwell-time function-based model is developed to analyze time-averaged dynamical difference images obtained by Kerr microscopy. As the image intensity is simply cumulated in time, also this method works independent of the DW frequency, provided the amplitudes are above optical resolution. With these techniques, the oscillation amplitude of the 180\u00b0 DW in a permalloy Landau structure is found to be constant with frequency (up to studied 1 kHz) and to increase linearly with the excitation amplitude. The former signifies that DW mobility is large enough for the DW to instantaneously follow the applied field. For this frequency region, our findings are in good agreement with the reported data for Cobalt structures,32 suggesting that the DW mobility of our Ni81Fe19 films is at least 10\n5 m s\u22121 T\u22121. Above findings are fully supported by micromagnetic simulations and can be understood by means of a simple domain model, which describes the excited Landau DW configuration as a forced damped harmonic oscillator, with the restoring force being influenced by size, thickness and anisotropy of the permalloy structure. Our new approach to time-averaged imaging and analysis of nanoscale DW oscillations is key to a more detailed understanding of DW dynamics.\nMethods"
