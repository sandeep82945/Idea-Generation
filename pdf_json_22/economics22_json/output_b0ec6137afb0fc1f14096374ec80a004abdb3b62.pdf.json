    "abstractText": "This study explores the influence of trade policy uncertainty on medical innovation investment in developing nations from 1980 to 2020, with a focus on the period of COVID-19. We used exogenous and heterogeneous exposure to trade-policy-uncertainty resolutions from developing countries\u2019 trade policy adjustments, which reduced tariff hikes on imported goods in a double difference-in-differences method. ARDL with PVAR has been studied for long-run and short-run analyses. The findings revealed that reducing tariff uncertainty boosts innovation beyond patent filings and margin reaction and exports. Long-term impacts of sectoral innovation patterns, governmental changes, and foreign technology entering developing nations have little effect on the findings. This paper also shows a long-term link between medical innovation, trade policy uncertainty, and research-and-development spending. Innovation\u2019s negative response to the innovation shock and research and development\u2019s positive response corroborates bidirectional and unidirectional causality. This study contributes to medical innovation and policy uncertainty in terms of developing countries and, most importantly, in trends of medical innovation, contemporaneous policy uncertainty given the inflow of foreign technology, and the importance of that technology recent times.",

            "text": "This study examines how trade policy uncertainty affects medical innovation investment in developing nations. Companies may benefit from delaying investment until business conditions improve, as has been described well by Bernanke (1983), Dixit (1989), Dixit et al. (1994), and Rodrik (1991). Emerging empirical literature explains that firms\u2019 investment behavior is consistent with this basic mechanism (Baker et al. 2016; Gulen and Ion 2016; Handley and Lim\u00e3o 2012, 2017; Julio and Yook 2016; Koijen et al. 2016). However, most empirical research focuses on employment, physical capital, productivity, or economic sectors, whereas investment in innovation or innovation across industries has received little attention. Innovation, important to economic growth, is hampered by policy ambiguity, and policy uncertainty has accelerated in recent years. These two reasons make it vital to evaluate policy uncertainty\u2019s impact on innovation (Baker et al. 2016). The US\u2013China trade conflict, Brexit, the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) renegotiation, and medical innovation pertaining to COVID-19 have all led to the increase of tariffs being a commercial concern. Investors, firms, and monetary authorities face the biggest global recession risk due to the trade war roller coaster. Some say tariff uncertainty is worse than actual tariffs. Handley and Lim\u00e3o (2015) adhere to the primary theoretical framework they created in 2014. In exchange for less protection, preferential trade agreements (PTAs)\nEconomies 2022, 10, 224. https://doi.org/10.3390/economies10090224 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/economies\nEconomies 2022, 10, 224 2 of 23\nabolish some protections. There were 283 PTAs in July 2010, a significant rise from 1990. This demonstrated that trade policy uncertainty decreases investment and entry into export markets and that exporters can benefit from PTAs even when trade barriers are low or nonexistent. Coelli et al. (2016) used international firm-level patent data to quantify the impact of 1990s-era trade policy on innovation in 60 countries as trade liberalization influences innovation, affecting technical change and growth. Trade policy liberalization likely boosted knowledge generation by 7% in the 1990s; increased patenting demonstrated innovation, not just information protection. It concluded that trade liberalization improves market access and import competition, boosting innovation. Amiti et al. (2017) used Chinese firm-product data for 2000\u20132006 to investigate the country-to-country impact of trade policy on innovation. This aggregate model predicts exporter pricing and quantity due to World Trade Organization (WTO) participation. The authors say that China\u2019s reduced input tariffs are the key source of U.S. welfare gains from China\u2019s entry into the WTO. Coelli (2018) explored the exogenous and heterogeneous sensitivity to trade-policyuncertainty resolutions after the U.S. discontinued tariff increases on Chinese imports. They documented that reducing tariff uncertainty has an economically and statistically significant effect. Moreover, the results are robust even when sectoral innovation trends, simultaneous policy changes, and foreign technology flow into China are considered. Health benefits and industrial growth depend on medical innovation and demand. Information, procedures, medications, biologics, technologies, and services help prevent and treat old and emerging diseases. This boom in medical innovation explains healthcare\u2019s rapid growth, as asserted by some authors (Cutler 1995; Fuchs 1996; Newhouse 1992). Understanding the rise of this enterprise and the medical research and development expenditures (R&D) that propelled it requires understanding investor returns. According to Newhouse (1992), most countries invest in new technologies, medical services, and hospitals, as well as in medical innovation, which health economists argue is the driving force behind the rise in global health care spending. Innovation is stimulated by direct and indirect payments (prescription medicine reimbursement and indirect reimbursements are for medical devices). According to Becker et al. (2005) and Murphy and Topel (2006), advances in healthcare have led to economic growth and decreased worldwide inequality. By using data from developing nations, it can be seen that better healthcare is comparable to other forms of economic expansion over the past century, as measured by per capita income (GDP). Increased life expectancy and quality may be the most valuable shift of the century; thus, the size and growth of the healthcare sector have spurred public debate. Medical equipment, biologics, medications, and associated services drive U.S. healthcare expenses. Private and public reimbursement restrictions affect U.S. profitability, and the Centers for Medicare Services (CMS) says Medicare and Medicaid funded 44% of U.S. spending in 2012, and Europe\u2019s government pays 85% of healthcare costs. Because health care manufacturing is primarily unfunded by public markets, manufacturers use public capital markets to fund R&D. Hospitals pay 35% of the total cost of health care and rely on debt or donations to operate. Twenty-two percent of healthcare expenditures are attributable to privately funded clinics; consequently, for-profit medical innovation companies are overrepresented on public stock markets due to a lack of public equity financing in important healthcare fields. Due to the concentration of U.S. medical product sales, U.S. government policies influence medical R&D returns. Egan and Philipson (2013) estimate that in 2012, U.S. health care spending accounted for 48% of worldwide spending, although U.S. GDP accounted for only 24% of global GDP. The United States\u2019 proportion of worldwide spending on biopharmaceuticals is 39%, as many rising nations spend more. Due to greater markups, U.S. markets contribute more to overall earnings than sales, concluding that medical R&D requires payment modifications that risk U.S. markups, whereas U.S. reimbursement policies impact asset values. It is widely acknowledged that R&D expenditures in medical innovation are driven by global returns rather than returns on the domestic market. For example, Swedish medical\nEconomies 2022, 10, 224 3 of 23\nproduct companies innovate to sell globally, not just domestically, because global returns stimulate innovation and boost healthcare spending. A country\u2019s healthcare economy and policies affect its growth. A tiny European country\u2019s growth depends on how U.S. policies affect global returns, as do future Medicare expenditures. Few health economists have studied how one country\u2019s healthcare policies affect another. Hammar and Belarbi (2021) study the non-linear relationship between R&D spending and innovations like productivity and high-tech exports. It has been demonstrated that linearity is frequently conditioned by other macroeconomic factors like the degree of development and financial openness. According to the findings, the R&D, innovation, and productivity threshold effects are strongest in the U.S., and the data shows that R&D spending, innovation, productivity, and medium- and high-tech exports have mixed effects. In contrast, positive and negative effects depend on innovation indicators or threshold variable levels. Therefore, the findings support the notion that the level of economic development can be used as a target indicator for implementing an innovation policy. This work utilizes medical patent applications from 65 developing nations from 1980 to 2020. Almost every company submits a patent that is tracked, including the filing date and the patent\u2019s technical class, which we link to product codes, and the filing country. We generated a panel dataset on the patenting of medical technologies by using these data. The empirical strategy reduces industry-specific innovation by utilizing the differential between \u201ccolumn 2\u201d and most favored nation (MFN) tariffs. We compare innovation in the uncertain medical industry before and after permanent-normal trade relations (PNTR) (the second difference) to analyze R&D and medical innovation, whereas innovation strategy takes into account industry and tech developments, which is a significant contribution to this study. Nonetheless, patentability and sunk R&D vary by industry, product, and time; industry-fixed effects erase only time-variable variations. Finally, to capture dynamic interdependencies and reverse causality, the panel vector autoregressive (PVAR) model will be implemented in the investigation of the timeliness of technological innovation. The remainder of this study follows this pattern. Section 2 will discuss the literature review and hypothesis development, which will help the author design a fundamental analysis. Section 3 discusses the economic framework of study, and Section 4 discusses the research methodology and design, including the population and sample size, variable and model descriptions, and data analysis technique. The results and discussion are discussed in Section 5, and the conclusion and policy implications and limitations of study are discussed in Section 6."

            "text": "Australia has high-quality data and a policy variation relevant to uncertainty (Handley and Lim\u00e3o 2015). Australia has historically had significant trade barriers. Unilateral liberalization has created enormous gaps between protection and obligations. It recently imposed preferential trade agreements (PTAs) like many developed countries. Several agreements were with developing countries with preferential, discretionary market access. These considerations include various trade-policy-uncertainty sources from the start. Theoretically informed empirical assessments of Australia\u2019s policy uncertainty and trade policy tools should be valid in a variety of applications and policy negotiations. Australia currently has low tariffs, but this has not always been the case from a historical perspective. Lloyd\u2019s (2008) study of 100-year time series for Australian tariffs demonstrates that some sectors were heavily protected in the early 1990s. Pre- and post-war protectionism and political meddling in tariff-making left a legacy according to Glezer (1982). The late 1980s and 1990s saw gradual, unilateral liberalization. Even in low-tariff sectors, a 2002\u20132006 exporter could look back a decade and fear a high-tariff system. Australia\u2019s binding commitments are large and dispersed due to the Uruguay Round (1986\u20131994) of multilateral negotiations (Corden 1996).

If Australia reverted all tariffs to their original form, the tariff profile would change. Only 24% of Australia\u2019s MFN tariffs match the contractual pledge in 2004. Reversing bindings can cause huge changes. Figure 1\u2019s histogram reveals that 73% of MFN tariffs could rise, some by 35%. Such reversals might diminish an exporter\u2019s profits by 19% annually.

COVID-19 and Uncertainty In the present time, COVID 19 is the factor that affects the medical industry and medical innovation. Innovation in the medical sector accelerated in the pandemic era and has had a huge impact on trade uncertainty, innovation, and investment, which is very important in the medical sector. After post-PNTR time, pre- and post-COVID time is also a recognizable shock to medical sector innovation. The COVID-19 pandemic raised uncertainty in many elements of daily life (Caggiano et al. 2020), and many characteristics of the virus remain unknown (Fauci et al. 2020). No one knows when the world will return to normal; the authors underline the significance of global cooperation and the importance of international governmental, corporate, and non-profit sectors working together to continue manufacturing vaccines (Corey et al. 2020; Gates 2020). Lockdowns and quarantines exacerbated stress and fear in many countries (Qiu et al. 2020). Scarce medical supplies, such masks and ventilators, have prompted nations to compete for them, forcing hospitals and health institutions to ration their inventory. These reasons have stoked global unease.\nFi 1. Shift in distribution of profits under a binding reversal in 2004 at applied (MFN rate) vs. b tarif levels."

They also say the current economic slowdown is due to COVID-19\u2019s excessive uncertainty. Sharif et al. (2020) validate\nEconomies 2022, 10, 224 5 of 23\nCOVID-19\u2019s impact on political and regulatory uncertainties. Albulescu (2020) notes that everyday statements about infections and deaths boost EPU. High uncertainty can complicate enterprises\u2019 activities by causing them to delay investment decisions (Chu and Fang 2020) and assume less debt (Guo et al. 2020), which could worsen the economic crisis and reduce cash injections. Baker et al. (2020b) said no disease has ever affected the stock market as much as COVID-19. These findings support the theory that COVID-19 uncertainty produced poorer economic growth, above-average bankruptcy rates, and high unemployment. This pandemic\u2019s unpredictability has deterred government authorities, corporate executives, and even individuals from making decisions. This complicates decision-making for private, governmental, and nonprofit executives."

            "heading": "2.1. Trade Policy Uncertainty, Research and Development, and Innovation",
            "text": "The literature on new product and service development stresses market size. Even before the PNTR, the United States was China\u2019s most important market, but the possibility of surprise tariff increases may have prompted enterprises to defer exporting and development. Companies began exporting after adopting permanent MFN status, according to Handley and Lim\u00e3o (2018a). Exporting companies should patent their products in the United States. This is determined by comparing the number of U.S. patent applications filed in highly exposed industries. According to our findings, more patent applications filed and granted by the USPTO result in a higher PNTR (USPTO). Due to the high expense of patenting and the fact that companies tend to file patents abroad only if they intend to export, increased U.S. exports are stimulating innovation (Coelli et al. 2016). Two scholarly research strands inform the study. First, this study was informed by the real options in the literature that state that uncertainty generates an option value of waiting, delaying irreversible investment (partially). Recent studies of uncertainty\u2019s effect on investment behavior include those of Bernanke (1983); Bloom (2007, 2016); Bloom et al. (2018); Dixit (1989); Dixit et al. (1994); Guiso and Parigi (1999); Rodrik (1991). Other research has analyzed and empirically examined the effects of policy uncertainty on investment (Baker et al. 2016; Fernandez-Villaverde et al. 2011; Gulen and Ion 2016; Handley and Lim\u00e3o 2012, 2018a; Julio and Yook 2016; Koijen et al. 2016). Most research on this topic has centered on physical capital investment, employment, and productivity, whereas the effects of uncertainty on R&D and innovation have been largely neglected. Exceptions exist, as Bloom (2007) demonstrates that R&D is less sensitive to shifts in demand under high levels of uncertainty, but he offers no actual evidence. Koijen et al. (2016) examine the U.S. healthcare business and demonstrate that government-induced uncertainty boosts medical innovation while decreasing medical R&D. After receiving the PNTR funding, Handley and Lim\u00e3o (2018b) show indirect evidence of technical changes that reduced marginal export costs. This research fills a gap in the literature by demonstrating that removing trade policy uncertainty increases innovation investment across industries. In addition, the contemporary literature on heterogeneous firms and trade emphasizes the complementarity between increasing overseas market access and investment in productivity-enhancing activities (Atkeson and Burstein 2010; Costantini and Melitz 2009; Lileeva and Trefler 2010). Other studies consider the impact of exporting on productivity\nEconomies 2022, 10, 224 6 of 23\n(Bernard and Jensen 1999; Biesebroeck 2005; Clerides et al. 1998; De Loecker 2007; Yan et al. 2022). Instead of discussing export status and productivity, this article focuses on investment in trade policy and innovation. In previous literature, uncertainty represented the most substantial shift. Based on Handley and Lim\u00e3o (2018a) and Bustos (2011), we present technology selection under uncertainty in a dynamic commerce model with heterogeneous firms. The approach combines two legitimate alternatives: option value of waiting and market access (Lileeva and Trefler 2010). The model, similar to that of Bustos (2011), argues that the decision to innovate is driven endogenously by market size and that only the most productive enterprises benefit from innovation. In contrast to Bustos (2011), the cost of innovation has already been invested, and uncertainty regarding foreign trade policy causes a \u201cband of inaction\u201d in which businesses do not invest and maintain a low level of technology. Reducing uncertainty decreases the option value of waiting, encouraging more businesses to innovate, and facilitating the development of the following hypothesis.\nH1. Trade policy uncertainty (TPU) and research and development (R&D) significantly affect patents (innovation) under the DID perspective.\nShea (1999) describes how patents or R&D spending might be used for long-term innovation analysis. She discovered a modest link between total factor productivity (TFP) and technology shocks after developing direct measurements of technological innovation based on patents and R&D spending. The results of Shea (1999) will likely demonstrate the limitations of basic patent counts, as they do not account for the vast economic variability of patents (Griliches 1998; Kortum and Lerner 1998). It is assumed that landscape changes, whether slow changes, as defined by Geels (2002), or shocks, as discussed by van Driel and Schot (2005), exert pressure on incumbent regimes, creating openings for radical niche innovation. On the other hand, it is generally recognized that not all economic crises or global shocks result in innovation breakthroughs, especially in the short term. Rather, such crises may have undesirable outcomes (Geels 2002). Identifying breakthrough inventions as the most important patents, i.e., patents in the right tail of our measure, enables us to develop aggregate and sectorial indices of technical change (Kelly et al. 2021). Their technological indexes range from 1840 to 2010 and include innovations from private and public companies, non-profit organizations, and the United States government. These indices properly depict the evolution of technological waves across time and are outstanding predictors of future output. The objective of the research conducted by Taalbi (2021) was to pit historical narratives and periodization of technological transitions against systematic data based on patterns in innovation output and innovation biographies. This research used data on innovation output and examined two concerns concerning the long-term innovation trends in the industrial industry, and paved the way to develop the following hypothesis.\nH2. Trade policy uncertainty (TPU) and research and development (R&D) significantly affect patents (innovation) under the short- and long-run perspective."

            "text": "Current studies on trade policy uncertainty fall into the following categories: First, they quantify the degree of trade policy uncertainty. Baker et al. (2016) derived the economic policy uncertainty index by using news articles and discovered that it is highly consistent with macrofluctuations, which explains its rationale. Caldara et al. (2020) utilised quarterly earnings call transcripts to identify trade policy uncertainty at the firm level. Tariff measurement assumes tariffs are the only source of trade policy uncertainty and analyses commerce before and after policy changes.\nEconomies 2022, 10, 224 7 of 23\nSecondly, the current studies focus on the macroeconomic implications of trade policy insecurity, imports and exports. By using Australian data, Handley et al. (2013) examined the effect of trade policy uncertainty on export enterprises. Product variety would have decreased 7% from 1993 to 2001 without WTO-imposed binding obligations. Removed uncertainty would account for more than half of Australia\u2019s predicted new product growth if all tariffs and restrictions are eliminated. Chen and Zhao (2021) and Mao (2020) used the DID technique to analyze the impact of trade policy uncertainty on Chinese companies\u2019 imported goods as a quasi-natural experiment. Reducing trade policy uncertainty has been shown to enhance imports in terms of volume, likelihood, duration, and quality. China\u2019s joining the World Trade Organization (WTO) in 2001 reduced trade policy uncertainty. It increased the number of trade items available to Chinese businesses, which increased firm employment. In turn, this increased the number of employees in Chinese businesses. A study by Pierce and Schott (2016) found that China\u2019s reduced external trade policy uncertainty harmed U.S. manufacturing jobs after PNTR was given to China in 2001. Shepotylo and Stuckatz (2017) found that trade policy uncertainty impacted foreign investment as EU\u2019s investment in Ukraine would increase if trade policy uncertainty in Ukraine were reduced. Caldara et al. (2020) looked at the macro and local effects of a trade policy uncertainty shock. Firm-level estimates imply that trade policy uncertainty may have reduced aggregate U.S. investment by 1% in 2018, whereas aggregate evidence from VAR analysis shows a negative impact of 1.5% to 2% on private investment in the United States in 2018. Thirdly, research is conducted on the microeconomic implications of trade policy uncertainty and procurement patterns. Heise et al. (2017) analyzed the effect of trade policy uncertainty on company procurement patterns. They discovered that when trade policy uncertainty is high, businesses choose American-style procurement to avoid trade conflicts. When trade policy uncertainty is low, the likelihood of a trade war is low, and corporations choose Japanese-style procurement because it is less expensive and increases societal welfare. Wang (2018) utilized Chinese microenterprise data from 2000 to 2006 to examine the impact of trade policy uncertainty on the earnings of export companies. In both the short and long term, the decline in trade policy uncertainty increased the revenues of exporting companies. Mao (2020) found that uncertainty over trade policy affects corporate savings.\nH3. Trade policy uncertainty (TPU) and research and development (R&D) significantly affect patents (innovation) under the VAR and granger causality models."

Investing in modern technology can increase the efficiency of the industry.

(10)\nIn this optimal stopping issue, the range of T is divided into a continuation and stopping regions, respectively. As a general rule, ideal intervals for termination can alternate with optimal intervals for continuation. Under plausible hypotheses, it is possible to prove that a single threshold value of T and R generates a clean separation of the range of T into a continuation region and stopping area, respectively:\n\u03a0Id(\u03d51)\u2212\u03a0d(\u03d50) + \u03a0 I d(\u03c4 U s , \u03d51)\u2212\u03a0x(\u03c4Us , \u03d50)\u2212 I = \u03b2Ex F(\u03c4\u2032s\nU , \u03d5) } .

Because the sector is constant, the sector difference is not considered. Comparing industries with greater and less vulnerability to trade policy uncertainty reveals similar patenting and innovation tendencies. A difference-indifferences technique can discover the causal relationship between trade policy uncertainty and innovation, assuming this assumption is true (Coelli 2018). These are the empirical models developed by using the approach outlined above.\n4.2.1. Difference-in-Differences (DID) Method\nWe have estimated the following generalized triple difference-in-differences model under the scope of this study:\nLn (pjnt) = \u03b1 + \u03c9nt + \u03c9jt + \u03b41 ln (TPU) + \u03b42 lnR&D + \u00b5. (15a)\nEconomies 2022, 10, 224 11 of 23\nAfter that, we included the post PNTR as interaction term with TPU, which helps to generate the next model, as given below,\nLn (pjnt) = \u03b1 + \u03c9nt + \u03c9jt + \u03b41postPNTRt* ln (TPU) + \u03b42 lnR&D + \u00b5, (15b)\nwhere ln (pjnt) is the dependent variable as log number of granted invention patents by all applicants in nation n in technology j and year t. The patent\u2019s four-digit technology code experimentally identifies the technology j, and n refers to the nation of residence of the applicant (patentee), not the patent office where the patent application was submitted. The dummies nt and jt stand for country time, country technology, and technology time, respectively. Post-PNTR dummy (Post-PNTRt), the trade policy uncertainty exposure (lnTPU), and the term of interest make up the fourth term on the right. The uncertainty exposure measure (lnTPU) is a weighted average of log differences between column 2 tariffs and MFN tariffs, as measured through the following formula:\nLn (TPUj) = \u2211h wjhln ( t2 t1 ) .\nAccording to the researchers\u2019 interpretation, this weight represents either the relative relevance of each high-tech HS product that can be created by using technology j or the researcher\u2019s uncertainty when mapping an unpatented technique to an unpatented product. It is supplied by Lybbert and Zolas (2012), who illustrate the correspondence between patent technology (IPC) and product (HS) codes.\n4.2.2. Long-Run and Short-Run Effect\nThe panel autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) bound approach is used to determine the long-term and short-term effects of TPU and R&D expenditure on innovation in the medical sector of developed and developing nations,\nYit = \u03b1 + \u03b11Xit + \u03b21Yi,t\u22121 + \u03b22Xi,t\u22121 + \u03b5it. (16)\nThe model, as presented through Equation (16), is the general form of the ARDL model. The panel ARDL technique was chosen to examine long- and short-term co-integration correlations between determinants and extract the error correction version (ECM) of the panel properties to discover short-term dynamics. In addition, alternative co-integration techniques, such as the Johansen and Juselius (1990) and traditional Johansen (1995) techniques, achieved comparable results. However, the panel autoregressive distributed lag approach was chosen over co-integration because of its added benefits, as defined below:\nDln (pjnt)t = \u03b1 + \u2211 k i=1 d\u03b41ln(TPU)t\u22121+\u2211 k i=1 d\u03b42 lnRandDt\u22121 + \u03a61 ln(TPU)t\u22121 + \u03a62 lnR&Dt\u22121 + \u00b5. (17)\nNo co-integration assumption can be tested by using the F test, which does not have a usual allocation based on (1) whether the elements involved in the model are entirely I (0), fully I (1), or a combination of both, (2) the number of estimators, and (3) if there is a trend, intercept, or both. Hammar and Belarbi (2021) also proposed a future study to analyze developing nations to resolve the endogeneity issue.\n4.2.3. Panel VAR Model\nPanel VAR has rechecked the reverse causality issue on the medical sector\u2019s respective indicators. Numerous investigations on the connection between innovation and global exchange also contain innovative worldwide exchange\u2019s impacts. Coe and Helpman (1995) and Coe et al. (1997) investigated the manners in which how the global exchange advanced mechanical advancement. In this regard, the panel vector autoregressive model\nEconomies 2022, 10, 224 12 of 23\nexamines the relationships between trade policy, innovation, and R&D expenditures among developed and developing economies, as given through the following equation:\nlnpit = \u03a6 + \u2211PK=1 \u03a61kln(TPU)it\u2212k + \u2211 P K=1 \u03a62kR&Dit\u2212k + \u03b5it . (18)\nThe autoregressive distributed lag approach treats all variables as dependent and independent. A further argument for employing the PVAR model is that, when using panel data, the temporal variation is more substantial than in cross-sections, and there is a direct relationship between all policy uncertainty variables."

The DID estimate and labor market regulations were also studied when Meyer et al. (1995) examined workers\u2019 compensation and absenteeism. The DID focuses on serially associated outcomes while ignoring standard error inconsistency. Bertrand et al. (2003) highlight possible DID prejudice and documented the three ways to overcome prejudices. When there are enough groups, block bootstrap can compute consistent standard errors. Even with a limited number of states, compressing data produces consistent standard errors (though the power of this test declines fast). When the number of groups is large enough, autocorrelation can be used to calculate standard errors. Therefore, we separated the data into pre-and post-time periods to eliminate error biases. The variance inflation factor (VIF) approach was used to test multicollinearity. Levine (1997) found no connection between explanatory factors when VIF = 1, but multicollinearity when VIF > 10. Multicollinearity was indicated when the VIF exceeded 5 (Gujarati and Porter 2009). Then, estimates and inference regarding the model\u2019s long-run properties are performed as suggested by Hendry et al. (1984) and Wickens and Breusch (1988). Different stationary variables, often called I (1) variables, complicate the study. Co-integration literature analyzes long-run correlations between I (1) variables, and its essential premise is that the classic ARDL approach is invalid in the presence of I (1) variables. A list of alternative estimation and hypothesis testing strategies for I (1) variables has been conducted, following Phillips and Loretan (1991). Pesaran et al. (1999) investigated the ARDL modeling approach for co-integration analysis to tackle this technique\u2019s difficulty. Johansen and Juselius (1990) and Pesaran et al. (1999) explored long-run structural modeling in the framework of an unrestricted VAR model. Applying the ARDL method in this study to systems with short-term and long-term identifying restrictions would bring us back to the Cowles commission approach presented in panel ARDL (Im and Pesaran 2003; Westerlund 2007). Coe et al. (1997) employ the PVAR model to assess the level of dynamic heterogeneity and reverse causality in the trade sector of economics. More precisely, the panel ARDL model is used for the long- and short-run impact of independent variables on dependent variables in case the variables are stationary at I (0) or integrated of I (1). PVAR model has been implied to check the effect and shocks of each variable on another variable. The IV regression model has multiple reasons to apply, such as checking the robustness and potential endogeneity issues in the model."

Whereas csolumns 2 to 6 provide the outcomes of R&D expenditures toward innovation, it contains the controls for WTO-related policy changes that were implemented at the same time. Indicators of FDI restrictions, non-tariff barriers, import duties, and imports are all included in these measures. TPU has a detrimental, time-fixed effect on innovation because these outcomes are for low-income nations with uncertain policies (Borojo et al. 2022). Patenting is often found to be associated with R&D and other indicators of innovation (Griliches 1990). In column 2, findings show that countries\u2019 R&D expenditures benefit innovation, allowing them to increase patents by increasing R&D spending (Dong et al. 2021). For further robustness, we have selected the control variables as FDI, imports, import tariff, and NTM, presented in columns 3 to 6 in this table. We have documented that FDI, imports, and NTM all favor innovation, but import tariffs have a negative impact. The negative association was observed because import tariffs are the main indicator to control the inflow of goods in response to demand and the inflow of patented and unpatented innovation through trade, as consistent with Coelli (2018). As intended, the coefficient of TPU is positive and statistically significant, indicating that policy uncertainty ex-ante is connected with enhanced innovation once trade policy uncertainty has been eradicated. As per previous work on these indicators, most of them are related to the one or two developed countries, which are now at the stage of sustaining innovation, instead of working on the fulfillment of necessities or the basics of innovation and trade-like developing countries. Any uncertainty in the world market has a huge impact on developing and low-income countries as compared to high-income countries, as discussed by Borojo et al. (2022).\nNote: This table reports the double difference-in-difference estimate in column 1 and the generalized double difference in difference in all models. The independent variable is the TPU. Constant, country time, and country technology fixed effect has been included but not reported here. Additional controls have been included regarding the country\u2019s NTM, imports from another world, FDI restrictions, and import tariff data. The data spam is from 1980 to 2020. Standard errors in parentheses. *** p < 0.01, * p < 0.1.\nEconomies 2022, 10, 224 15 of 23\nBefore the 2001 PNTR conference, trade policy uncertainty was unrelated to innovation. Table 6 displays the results for post-PNTR time events by using the generalized DID estimation method among the innovation, TPU, and R&D expenditures with control variables by using the time and country fixed effect, in which the post-PNTR dummy is replaced in the main model and interacted with all variables. Columns 2 to 6 of this table evaluate the DID estimates of post-PNTR analysis, which contains country time and country technology fixed effect. Columns 2 to 6 provide the outcomes of control variables integrated with the PNTR dummy factor, which allows us to analyze the events of innovation and TPU in the post-PNTR period.\nNote: This table reports the double difference-in-difference estimate in column (1) and the generalized double difference in difference in all models. The independent variable is the interaction term of the post-NTR dummy and TPU. Constant, country time, and country technology fixed effect has been included but not reported here. Additional controls have been included regarding the country\u2019s NTM, imports from another country, FDI restrictions, and import tariff data. The data spam is from 1980 to 2020. Standard errors in parentheses, (*** p < 0.01).\nThe findings in column 1 of this table reported that a significant and negative relationship exists between innovation and TPU, which leads to the conclusion that a change in pre-WTO TPU exposure leads to a negative change in post-PNTR patenting activity. Moreover, findings in column 2 show that R&D has a significant and positive impact on innovation, showing that pre-WTO spending through R&D directly affected patenting after the PNTR period, as consistent with Borojo et al. (2022) and Dong et al. (2021). It would appear that the United States is the largest export market for health-related technologies; however, there are a number of organizations and categories for developing countries that do not include either the United States or European nations; this includes many in Asia, Africa, etc. Furthermore, the United States does not participate in trade between these countries, despite the fact that they provide cheap goods to each other through bilateral trade. Foreign direct investment (FDI) from the United States facilitates the export of certain technologies to emerging economies. China, albeit still considered a developing country, has a substantial export market in the medical field; hence it was only products from other developing countries that were considered for this study. According to results of Tables 5 and 6, the impact of R&D investment is greater in the post-PNTR period as opposed to the entire time period, which is consistent with the expectations regarding investment and innovation following the post-PNTR. Table 7 demonstrates the results of two-stage least square (2SLS) estimation by using post-PNTR *lnT2 as an instrument for post-PNTR *lnTPU with country time and country technology fixed effect. Results for 2SLS estimations are shown in different steps. First, OLS estimation has been run, then reduced from, first stage and 2SLS, because it is possible\nEconomies 2022, 10, 224 16 of 23\nto instrument the baseline uncertainty exposure metric by using column 2 tariffs from Smoot\u2013Hawley. As Coelli (2018) discussed, the uncertainty exposure meter, lnTPU, is plausibly exogenous because virtually all fluctuation derives from the 1930 column 2 tariffs introduced by Smoot\u2013Hawley. If the U.S. purposely applied MFN tariffs, this would result in smaller log differences between column 2 and MFN tariffs, biasing the findings against identifying an uncertainty effect on innovation. The results show that for both OLS and 2sls, all variables are significant, but P.TPU, PFDI, and P.impT have a negative impact and PRD has a positive impact on innovation. In reduced form equation estimations and first stage estimation, the instrumental variable column 2 tariff is highly significant but negatively impacts innovation in developing countries. The results concluded that the estimated effect is statistically significant and equivalent in magnitude to the baseline estimation.\nNote: This table indicates 2sls generalized double difference in difference estimates of inverse hyperbolic sine of patents and trade policy uncertainty. TPU is estimated with the instrumental variable column 2 tariff. Constant, country time, and country technology fixed effect has been included but not reported here. Column (1\u20134) reports the OLS, first stage (FS), 2sls, and reduced form (RF) estimates. Additional controls have been included regarding the country\u2019s NTM, imports from another world, FDI restrictions, and import tariff data. The data spam is from 1980 to 2020.

In other words, the outcomes correspond to our expectations. TPU\u2019s effects on the nations of a destination significantly impact the vast array of potential new ideas (Borojo et al. 2022). Short-term estimation results indicate that TPU and R&D variations have no substantial effect on innovation; however, the significant EC term indicates long-term co-integration.

It demonstrated that a country\u2019s current innovation and R&D spending significantly and favorably impact developing countries; therefore, TPU, innovation, R&D expenditures, and their corresponding lags are found to have reverse causality. TPU is the factor that creates uncertainty, and because of this, it has a significant but negative impact on its previous year\u2019s value but a good impact on the fourth lag. R&D is the factor that justifies the investment in innovation, which is why it has a positive and significant impact on its previous year\u2019s value, but a negative impact on fourth lags. In addition, PAT is the factor that also depends on its previous value, as it has a significant and positive relationship with its previous three lags.

Through the elimination of policy uncertainty and, subsequently, the encouragement of innovation in developing and low-income nations, our article suggests that trade liberalization may contribute to economic growth. Understanding the impact of policy uncertainty is crucial for economists and policymakers assessing the efficacy of economic programs. For instance, the time following the 2008 global financial crisis witnessed an increase in trade protectionism. Numerous nations employ non-tariff measures, such as anti-dumping probes, or identify others as \u201ccurrency manipulators.\u201d Recent events, such as the Brexit vote and open calls for protectionist measures by the U.S. government, have all suggested that the future of the global trading system is increasingly questionable.
