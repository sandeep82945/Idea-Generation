    "abstractText": "This paper examines the dynamic conditional correlations among 10 cryptocurrencies and the possibility of hedging investment strategies among multiple cryptocurrencies over the period affected by COVID-19 from 2017 to 2022. After studying the relationship between Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the other eight cryptocurrencies, four main results were obtained in this paper: first, from the pre-COVID-19 period to the COVID-19 period, almost all of the cryptocurrencies\u2019 return growth rates increased, and COVID-19 had a positive effect on the returns of cryptocurrencies. Second, all of the cryptocurrencies\u2019 return indices had features of volatility clustering and memory persistence in the long run; from pre-COVID-19 to COVID-19, these cryptocurrencies\u2019 GARCH values decreased, but the correlations among the varying GARCH values increased. Third, the varying correlations between the return indices of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the other cryptocurrencies were very strong; from pre-COVID-19 to COVID-19, the average dynamic correlations between Bitcoin and the others increased. Fourth, Tether can be used as a hedge cryptocurrency against the other cryptocurrencies as COVID-19 enhanced its hedging feature.",

            "text": "Cryptocurrencies have become a popular economic and financial topic. When a cryptocurrency is defined as a digital currency, it is very different from a fiat currency because cryptocurrencies are not issued by any judicial body (IFRSIC 2019). Generally, a cryptocurrency does not have any original intrinsic value; however, it has an extrinsic value that is totally dependent on the expectation that future investors will be willing to pay for it in the cryptocurrency market. Many researchers believe that cryptocurrencies will become a mainstream financial instrument in future global financial markets in addition to common stocks, commodities, and precious metals or foreign exchange instruments (Soylu et al. 2020). The risk involved in cryptocurrencies is obvious. Because of their higher volatilities (Caporale and Zekokh 2019; Siswantoro et al. 2020), cryptocurrencies cannot be accepted as a common standard for measuring the relative worth of goods and services, even though many researchers admit that cryptocurrencies are a medium of exchange. Accordingly, some researchers do not accept that cryptocurrencies are currencies; they prefer to maintain that cryptocurrencies behave more like an investment instrument than a currency (I\u0307\u00e7elliog\u0306lu and \u00d6ner 2019). However, some researchers have suggested that the higher volatilities may be Granger causes of the higher liquidities. Be\u0328dowska-S\u00f3jka et al. (2019) verified the relationship between the volatility and liquidity of cryptocurrencies by investigating the daily and weekly data of the 12 most popular cryptocurrencies during the period of 2013\u20132017\nJ. Risk Financial Manag. 2022, 15, 113. https://doi.org/10.3390/jrfm15030113 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jrfm\nJ. Risk Financial Manag. 2022, 15, 113 2 of 25\nand found that the cryptocurrencies with higher volatilities are Granger causes of high liquidities and can attract investors and lead to higher interest from investors. In terms of changes in the value of cryptocurrencies, this volatility seems to have intensified during the COVID-19 pandemic (Siswantoro et al. 2020). As the year 2022 progresses, the epidemic has slowed down in many countries as vaccines become more widely available. Simultaneously, the dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) changes in cryptocurrencies before and after COVID-19 have become a major point of contention for investors. From a portfolio perspective, if the dynamic conditional correlation among cryptocurrencies increases, then holding multiple cryptocurrencies at the same time will increase the portfolio risk. Conversely, if the dynamic conditional correlation among cryptocurrencies decreases, then there is an opportunity to hedge risk. This study fills the research gap by identifying the volatility of cryptocurrencies and the dynamic conditional correlation among different cryptocurrencies since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. After empirical analysis using sample data from 8 September 2017 to 14 February 2022 and studying the relationship between Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the other eight cryptocurrencies, including Tether, Ripple, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Stellar, Monero, EOS, and NEO, we confirmed that from the pre-COVID-19 period to the COVID-19 period almost all of the 10 cryptocurrencies\u2019 return growth rates increased. Moreover, the researched 10 cryptocurrencies\u2019 return indices had features of volatility clustering or memory persistence in the long run, and all of the 10 cryptocurrencies\u2019 GARCH values decreased from the preCOVID-19 period to the COVID-19 period. The correlations among the varying GARCH time series of the 10 cryptocurrencies were quite high, and the correlations among the varying GARCH time series of the 10 cryptocurrencies increased from the pre-COVID-19 period to the COVID-19 period. This study also found that, except for Tether, the varying correlations between the return indices of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the other cryptocurrencies were very strong; the correlations between the return indices of Ethereum and the other cryptocurrencies were higher than for Bitcoin and the others. Except for Tether, the average DCC values between Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the other cryptocurrencies increased; since the COVID-19 pandemic began, the correlations among the 10 cryptocurrencies\u2019 return indices, except for Tether\u2019s, have become higher than before. Finally, the correlations between the return indices of Tether and the other nine cryptocurrencies were negative, and Tether can be a hedge cryptocurrency for the other cryptocurrencies."

            "text": "The volatilities of cryptocurrencies exhibit the characteristics of significant time varying and clustering. When large fluctuations in returns tend to be followed by relatively large fluctuations, smaller fluctuations in returns tend to be followed by relatively small fluctuations. This is accompanied by the realization that the bad news has a much bigger impact on the cryptocurrency market volatility than the good news (Palamalai et al. 2020). The characteristics of long memory or persistence in volatility have also been discussed by some researchers. Abakah et al. (2020) analyzed the volatility persistence in 12 main cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Bitshare, Bytecoin, Dash, Ethereum, Litecoin, Monero, Nem, Ripple, Siacoin, Stellar, and Tether, by considering the possibility of structural breaks and found that the volatilities represented in both absolute and squared returns display long memory features, but after accounting for structural breaks, the degree of persistence in the cryptocurrency market is reduced. Different cryptocurrencies have different volatility clustering structures and different spillover patterns, and the market price bubbles are associated with the volatilities of cryptocurrencies. Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin are the most relevant cryptocurrencies in general, serving as connection hubs for the linking of many other cryptocurrencies. However, their roles have been challenged lately, potentially owing to the increased usage of other cryptocurrencies over time. Sensoy et al. (2020) examined the high-frequency return and volatility of major cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Bitcoin Cash, Dash, EOS, Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, Iota, Litecoin, OmiseGO, Monero, Ripple, and Zcash,\nJ. Risk Financial Manag. 2022, 15, 113 3 of 25\nusing the 15-min time series from 10 August 2017 to 23 June 2018 and found that volatility clustering structures of the returns are distinct among the different cryptocurrencies. Enoksen et al. (2020) also studied which variables can predict bubbles in the prices of eight major cryptocurrencies by using the data from 27 December 2013 to 25 February 2019 and found that the multiple bubble periods were located in 2017 and early 2018. They mentioned that the cryptocurrencies\u2019 higher volatilities, trading volume, and transactions were positively associated with the presence of bubbles across the cryptocurrencies. In fact, the relationship between cryptocurrencies and COVID-19 is a very topical subject (Iqbal et al. 2021). Garc\u00eda-Medina and Hern\u00e1ndez C (2020) investigated the effects of the financial turbulence of 2020 on the cryptocurrency market by considering the hourly price and volume of transactions from December 2019 to April 2020, finding that the volatility clustering increased dramatically in March 2020. Corbet et al. (2020) analyzed the largest cryptocurrencies\u2019 time-varying correlations by using daily data from 2019 to 2020 and found that the cryptocurrencies\u2019 returns were significantly influenced by the negative sentiment around COVID-19 during 2020, and the trading volumes and returns of cryptocurrencies significantly increased. James et al. (2021) examined the distribution extremities and erratic behaviors of 51 cryptocurrencies using a structural break method to evaluate the impact of COVID-19 on the cryptocurrency market when the time period was divided into the pre-COVID-19 period from 30 June 2018 to 31 December 2019 and the COVID-19 period from 1 January 2020 to 24 June 2020. They found that during the pre-COVID-19 period, the cryptocurrency market exhibited considerable homogeneity with respect to the structural breaks in volatility, whereas during the COVID-19 period the homogeneity of volatility was disrupted by the pandemic and the self-similarity was reduced. Since COVID-19 began in January 2020, and after the volatility clustering increased dramatically in March 2020 (Garc\u00eda-Medina and Hern\u00e1ndez C 2020), the trading volumes and returns of cryptocurrencies have significantly increased (Corbet et al. 2020), with an unexpected shift toward positive average return among the distribution extremities (James et al. 2021), and most cryptocurrencies absorbed the small shocks of COVID-19 by registering positive gains (Iqbal et al. 2021). In terms of financial strategies, after analyzing the correlations and the characteristics of hedging among cryptocurrencies, some scholars announced that the correlations between Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies are strong, and no hedging abilities exist among cryptocurrencies (Kyriazis et al. 2019). Ciaian et al. (2018) examined the interdependencies between Bitcoin and the other 16 alternative cryptocurrencies in the short run and long run by applying time series analytical mechanisms for the daily data during 2013\u20132016 and found that the correlations between the prices of Bitcoin and the other 16 alternative cryptocurrencies are indeed significantly strong in both the short run and the long run. However, it is worth examining whether such an opportunity is arising in the postCOVID-19 pandemic period. To illustrate, the unique characteristics of Tether have been isolated from the other cryptocurrencies, and some researchers have proven that Tether has different characteristics from the other cryptocurrencies. Tether exhibits unusually docile profiles for extreme behaviors (James et al. 2021). Dilek et al. (2020) studied how the changes in gold and oil prices affected the daily price movements of various cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, Litecon, and EOS, for the period from 1 August 2017 to 3 April 2019 and found that there were no cointegration relationships between the cryptocurrencies and the macroeconomic factors, including gold and oil prices, except for Tether. Huynh et al. (2020) investigated the volatility spillover effects among 14 cryptocurrencies by using the daily dataset covering the period from April 2013 to April 2019, finding that only Tether had average negative return while all the other cryptocurrencies exhibited positive values. From the above literature review, we found deficits in the research on cryptocurrencies that we needed to pay more attention to in our research.\nJ. Risk Financial Manag. 2022, 15, 113 4 of 25\nFirstly, although many researchers have studied the varying volatilities of cryptocurrencies (Palamalai et al. 2020; Abakah et al. 2020; Enoksen et al. 2020) and the impacts of COVID-19 on the cryptocurrencies\u2019 volatility (Ardia et al. 2019; Garc\u00eda-Medina and Hern\u00e1ndez C 2020; James et al. 2021), the average decreasing features from the pre-COVID-19 period to the COVID-19 period have not been summarized by anyone, and we will discuss this issue. Actually, volatility clustering is a basic in-sample characteristic of cryptocurrencies (Ardia et al. 2019); based on a GARCH(1,1) model, the characteristics of clustering, spillover, asymmetry, and long memory in volatility share the same feature, which is dependent on the coefficient of GARCH. If we do not consider the reasons for the time series\u2019 volatility, we can find the characteristics of volatility by investigating the models of GARCH. Secondly, although the volatility connectedness of cryptocurrencies has been discussed by some researchers (Le et al. 2021), the structure changes between the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods have not been discussed. Because the sample observations of the previous researchers for the COVID-19 period are not enough, it is necessary to reassess the result. Thirdly, even though some researchers have discussed the time-varying correlations (Corbet et al. 2020) and returns (Iqbal et al. 2021), seldom have researchers discussed how COVID-19 impacts on the cryptocurrencies\u2019 correlation and return together. For cryptocurrencies, higher positive correlations will represent the homogeneity among them, but low or negative correlations will represent the hedging abilities among them. The dynamic conditional correlation (DCC) models are usually used to represent the dynamic relationship for a normality time series. It is necessary to analyze the correlations of the cryptocurrencies dynamically. Finally, even though some researchers have proven that no hedging abilities exist among the cryptocurrencies (Kyriazis et al. 2019), it is still necessary to discuss the characteristics of Tether (Dilek et al. 2020; Huynh et al. 2020; James et al. 2021). We will discuss if Tether can be a hedge cryptocurrency for the other cryptocurrencies."

The prices of the cryptocurrencies are represented by US Dollars (USD), and the data period covers 8 September 2017 to 14 February 2022, which contains 1621 daily observations. The abbreviations BTC, ETH, TET, XRP, LTC, BCH, XLM, XMR, EOS, and NEO are used to represent the 10 top cryptocurrencies, which are ranked on the cryptocurrency market list between 1st and 58th within all 10,707 cryptocurrencies (Investing 2022). Table 1 lists the ranking, price, market cap, and 24 h trading volume of the 10 cryptocurrencies in the global market on 18 February 2022. To compare the impacts of COVID-19 on the return indices of cryptocurrencies between the periods before and after COVID-19, the full time period was divided into a pre-COVID19 period from 8 September 2017 to 31 December 2019 with 845 observations and a COVID19 period from 1 January 2020 to 18 February 2022 with 776 observations. Statistically, by 18 February 2022, the total number of cryptocurrencies in the world had reached 10,707, the total market capitalization had reached USD 1850 billion, and the 24-hour exchange volume had reached USD 56.906 billion. Comparatively, the total market capitalization of these 10 cryptocurrencies reached USD 1261.318 billion with 68.18% of the total cryptocurrency market, and the 24-h exchange volume reached USD 33.76 billion with 59.32% of the world total cryptocurrency market. These 10 top cryptocurrencies represented the characteristics of the total cryptocurrency market. Each cryptocurrency\u2019s market ranking was based on the ratio of the market cap in the whole market. It was clear that Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Tether were the three highest ranking cryptocurrencies, with market cap ratios of 41.69, 18.77, and 4.26%.\nJ. Risk Financial Manag. 2022, 15, 113 5 of 25\nNote: B represents USD 1 billion.\nComparatively, similar to the market cap, Bitcoin had the highest ratio of 24 h trading volume in the total market. The 24 h trading volume ratio of Bitcoin was as high as 30.68%, which was much greater than the 24 h trading volume ratios of Ethereum at 23.21% and Tether at 4.60%. They were the three most important cryptocurrencies in the market. As opposed to the stock market, cryptocurrencies are exchanged every day in the cryptocurrency market. All the continuous daily data were collected every day during the sample observation period. EViews and MATLAB software were used for the empirical analysis. Assume that the time variable is t \u2208 {1, 2, . . . , T}. The terminal point T is the total number of daily observations. When the variable i \u2208 {BTC, ETH, XRP, TET, LTC, BCH, EOS, XLM, XMR, NEO}, for the ith cryptocurrency, if the variable pi,t is the daily closing price at the time point t, then the return index variable ri,t will be\nri,t = pi,t\npi,t\u22121 , when t = 2, 3, . . . , T.

Risk Financial Manag. 2022, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 15 of 26\nIt was proven that COVID-19 caused the cryptocurrencies\u2019 volatilities in the COVID19 period to fluctuate less than in the pre-COVID-19 period. Since 2020, the volatilities of most of the cryptocurrencies have decreased. This means that most of the cryptocurrencies fluctuate less than before the beginning of COVID-19.\nFigure 2. Curves of GARCH values from the 10 cryptocurrencies\u2019 return indices for the full period (8 September 2017\u201314 February 2022).\nThird, from the correlations among the varying GARCH time series of the 10 cryptocurrencies, we found that the correlations were quite high. This result was similar to that of Le et al. (2021). Table 10 lists the results of the correlations among the varying GARCH values of the 10 cryptocurrencies\u2019 return indices for the full period. For the full period, the average correlations between each of the 10 varying GARCH time series and the other 9 varying GARCH time series were 0.6470024, 0.6425153, 0.3233569, 0.4865397, 0.6103941, 0.6115659, 0.519619, 0.6720849, 0.6497457, and 0.6058991, respectively, for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, Ripple, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Stellar, Monero, EOS, and NEO. These correlations were quite high. These high correlations revealed that the volatilities of all 10 cryptocurrencies fluctuated in a similar fashion.\nFigure 2. Curves of GARCH values from the 10 cryptocurrencies\u2019 return indices for the full period (8 September 2017\u201314 February 2022).\nWhen the full time period was divided into the two periods of pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19, the characteristics of the GARCH values were differentiated. Table 9 lists the results of the comparison of the average GARCH values of the 10 cryptocurrencies\u2019 return indices for t thre periods. First, duri g the three time peri ds, Tether had the lowest GARCH values; inversely, the other nine cryptocurrencies had much higher GARCH values an Tether. During the full period, the average GARCH value of Teth was 0.002857; however, the average GARCH values of the other nine cryptocurrencies were between 0.040666 and 0.069265. During the pr -COVID-19 period, the avera e GARCH value of Tether was 0.004809; however, th average GARCH values o the other ine cryptocurre cies were between 0.041508 and 0.073962.\nJ. Risk Financial Manag. 2022, 15, 113 15 of 25\nDuring the COVID-19 period, the average GARCH value of Tether was 0.000730; however, the average GARCH values of the other nine cryptocurrencies were between 0.039749 and 0.064930. This meant that the volatility of Tether had less fluctuation than the other nine cryptocurrencies. Second, when comparing the GARCH values between both periods of pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19, it was proven that the GARCH values of 8 out of 10 cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Tether, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Stellar, Monero, EOS, and NEO, decreased from the pre-COVID-19 period to the COVID-19 period. From the pre-COVID-19 period to the COVID-19 period, the average GARCH values of Bitcoin, Tether, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Stellar, Monero, EOS, and NEO decreased in differences of \u22120.001759, \u22120.004079, \u22120.001843, \u22120.009880, \u22120.008317, \u22120.002981, \u22120.010959, and \u22120.008727, respectively. The differences in the GARCH values of Ethereum and Ripple between the pre-COVID19 and COVID-19 periods were positive, but the differences were quite small at 0.000002 and 0.001926. It was proven that COVID-19 caused the cryptocurrencies\u2019 volatilities in the COVID-19 period to fluctuate less than in the pre-COVID-19 period. Since 2020, the volatilities of most of the cryptocurrencies have decreased. This means that most of the cryptocurrencies fluctuate less than before the beginning of COVID-19. Third, from the correlations among the varying GARCH time series of the 10 cryptocurrencies, we found that the correlations were quite high. This result was similar to that of Le et al. (2021). Table 10 lists the results of the correlations among the varying GARCH values of the 10 cryptocurrencies\u2019 return indices for the full period. For the full period, the average correlations between each of the 10 varying GARCH time series and the other 9 varying GARCH time series were 0.6470024, 0.6425153, 0.3233569, 0.4865397, 0.6103941, 0.6115659, 0.519619, 0.6720849, 0.6497457, and 0.6058991, respectively, for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, Ripple, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Stellar, Monero, EOS, and NEO. These correlations were quite high. These high correlations revealed that the volatilities of all 10 cryptocurrencies fluctuated in a similar fashion.\nJ. Risk Financial Manag. 2022, 15, 113 16 of 25\nFourth, the correlations among the varying GARCH time series of the 10 cryptocurrencies increased from the pre-COVID-19 period to the COVID-19 period.\nTable 11 lists the results of the correlations among the varying GARCH values of the 10 cryptocurrencies\u2019 return indices for the pre-COVID-19 period.\nTable 12 lists the results of the correlations among the varying GARCH values of the 10 cryptocurrencies\u2019 return indices for the COVID-19 period.\nJ. Risk Financial Manag. 2022, 15, 113 17 of 25\nFrom the pre-COVID-19 period to the COVID-19 period, the average correlations between each of the 10 varying GARCH time series and the other 9 varying GARCH time series increased 0.0070144, 0.0859532, 0.00509, 0.1442054, 0.1644883, 0.0677548, 0.0246983, 0.0081004, and 0.112502, respectively, for Bitcoin, Ethereum, Tether, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Stellar, Monero, EOS, and NEO, except for Ripple. These positive differences proved that from the pre-COVID-19 period to the COVID-19 period, the correlations among the varying GARCH value time series increased.\nThis meant that COVD-19 increased the correlations among the different cryptocurrencies\u2019 dynamic volatilities. It was proven that the trends of cryptocurrencies\u2019 dynamic volatilities moved in a similar pattern. Fifth, for the pre-COVID-19 period, the highest GARCH values occurred during 2017\u2013 2018. For the COVID-19 period, the highest GARCH values occurred during March 2020. Although the highest GARCH values were not avoidable during the COVID-19 period, the average GARCH values decreased, and the correlations among the varying GARCH time series of the 10 cryptocurrencies increased."

The correlations among the varying DCC value time series between Bitcoin and Ethereum and the varying DCC value time series between Bitcoin and Ripple, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Stellar, Monero, EOS, and NEO were 0.761078, 0.727885, 0.808231, 0.680740, 0.787096, 0.715787, and 0.839999, respectively, which were quite high. The correlations among the varying DCC value time series between Ethereum and Bitcoin and the varying DCC value time series between Ethereum and Ripple, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Stellar, Monero, EOS, and NEO were 0.587975, 0.620270, 0.739476, 0.732984, 0.627493, 0.666690, and 0.541859, respectively, which were also quite high. It was clear that the trend changes in the DCC value time series between Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the other cryptocurrencies were similar. Fifth, we determined the differences of the other cryptocurrencies from Tether, whose characteristics were quite different.\nJ. Risk Financial Manag. 2022, 15, 113 23 of 25\nFor the full period, the average DCC values between the return indices of Bitcoin and Tether were negative, being \u22120.01701 for the full period, 0.0131 for the pre-COVID-19 period, and \u22120.0500 for the COVID-19 period. For the full period, the correlations among the DCC value time series between Bitcoin and Tether and the DCC value time series between Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies, including Ethereum, Ripple, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Stellar, Monero, EOS, and NEO, were negative at \u22120.081714, \u22120.029559, \u22120.099312, \u22120.145631, \u22120.067753, \u22120.054917, \u22120.094690, and \u22120.069847, respectively. For the full period, the correlations between the return index of Tether and the other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Stellar, Monero, and EOS, were negative at \u22120.021680, \u22120.026539, \u22120.032471, \u22120.034959, \u22120.034237, \u22120.022461, and \u22120.022924. For the pre-COVID-19 period, the correlations between the return index of Tether and the other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Stellar, Monero, and EOS, were 0.010457, 0.001710, \u22120.018437, \u22120.014268, \u22120.022881, 0.005238, and \u22120.003722, respectively. Although the static correlations between the return indices of Tether and the other cryptocurrencies were not always negative, the maximum values of the static correlations were less than 0.010457. For the COVID-19 period, the correlations between the return index of Tether and the other cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Bitcoin Cash, Stellar, Monero, and EOS, were negative at \u22120.243461, \u22120.221253, \u22120.155334, \u22120.214276, \u22120.148999, \u22120.219096, and \u22120.175636, respectively. This means that the correlations between the return index of Tether and most of the other cryptocurrencies were negative. From the pre-COVID-19 period to the COVID-19 period, on average, the correlations between Tether and the other cryptocurrencies changed from negative or very small to negative; Tether became a highly hedging cryptocurrency against the other cryptocurrencies. Because the correlations between the return indices of Tether and the other cryptocurrencies were mostly negative or very low, Tether can be a hedge cryptocurrency against the other cryptocurrencies. This result was totally different from the research of Kyriazis et al. (2019) because they confirmed that no hedging abilities existed among cryptocurrencies. COVID-19 has enhanced the degree of negative correlations, or it has increased the hedging characteristics between Tether and the other cryptocurrencies."

            "text": "This paper focused on studying the relationship between Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the other eight cryptocurrencies, including Tether, Ripple, Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, Stellar, Monero, EOS, and NEO. The observation sample data covered the full time period from 8 September 2017 to 14 February 2022, with 1621 observations, and covered the time when the full period was divided into the pre-COVID-19 period from 8 September 2017 to 31 December 2019, with 845 observations, and the COVID-19 period from 1 January 2020 to 14 February 2022, with 776 observations.\nAfter an empirical analysis, we arrived at four main results. First, the descriptive statistics and tests proved that, from the pre-COVID-19 period to\nthe COVID-19 period, almost all of the 10 cryptocurrencies\u2019 growth rates increased; thus, COVID-19 had a positive effect on the returns of cryptocurrencies. Second, from the empirical results of the GARCH(1,1) models, we proved that, for all of the 10 GARCH(1,1) models, the values of the coefficient \u03b2i were greater than 0.641374, which means that these 10 cryptocurrencies\u2019 return indices had features of volatility clustering or memory persistence in the long run. This result was similar to those of Soylu et al. (2020), Palamalai et al. (2020), Abakah et al. (2020), and Sensoy et al. (2020). Tether had the lowest GARCH values, but the other nine cryptocurrencies had higher GARCH values than Tether; all of the 10 cryptocurrencies\u2019 GARCH values decreased from the pre-COVID-19 period to the COVID-19 period. The correlations among the varying GARCH time series of the 10 cryptocurrencies were quite high and were similar to the findings of Le et al. (2021). The correlations among the varying GARCH time series of the 10 cryptocurrencies increased\nJ. Risk Financial Manag. 2022, 15, 113 24 of 25\nfrom the pre-COVID-19 period to the COVID-19 period. The trends of cryptocurrencies\u2019 dynamic volatilities moved in a similar pattern: for the pre-COVID-19 period, the highest GARCH values occurred during 2017\u20132018; for the COVID-19 period, the highest GARCH values occurred during March 2020. Third, from the empirical results of the DCC(1,1) models, we proved that, except for Tether, the varying correlations between the return indices of Bitcoin, Ethereum, and the other cryptocurrencies were very strong, similar to the findings of Ciaian et al. (2018) and Lahajnar and Rozanec (2020). They proved that the correlations between Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies were strong; the correlations between Ethereum and the others were higher than between Bitcoin and the others. Since the COVID-19 pandemic began, the average values of the DCC between Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies, except Tether, have increased; except for Tether, since the COVID-19 pandemic began, the correlations among the 10 cryptocurrencies\u2019 return indices have become higher than before. Fourth, the characteristics of Tether were quite different from those of the other cryptocurrencies: during the COVID-19 period, the static correlations between the return indices of Tether and the other nine cryptocurrencies were negative; during the pre-COVID19 period and the full period, the static correlations between the return indices of Tether and the other cryptocurrencies were not always negative but were very low at less than 0.010457. Tether can act as a hedge cryptocurrency for the other cryptocurrencies, and this result differed from the research of Kyriazis et al. (2019) because they found that no hedging abilities existed among cryptocurrencies.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, K.Y. and H.Y.; methodology, K.Y. and H.Y.; software, K.Y. and H.Y.; validation, K.Y. and H.Y.; formal analysis, K.Y. and H.Y.; investigation, K.Y. and H.Y.; resources, K.Y. and H.Y.; data curation, K.Y. and H.Y.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, K.Y. and H.Y.; writing\u2014review and editing, H.Y. and H.Y.; visualization, K.Y. and H.Y.; supervision, H.Y. and R.G.; project administration, K.Y.
