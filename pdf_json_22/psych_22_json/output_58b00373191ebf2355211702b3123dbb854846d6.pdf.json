    "abstractText": "Bipolar disorder (BD) is a lifelong neuropsychiatric disorder that exerts a substantial personal and public health toll, an elevated lifetime risk of suicide,1 and a remarkable degree of heterogeneity or diversity (we use these terms inter\u00ad changeably). Existing studies of heterogeneity in BD tend to focus on variability or clustering along a limited number of features or domains.2 However, identifying heterogeneity across a limited number of features does not necessarily help us characterize the overall heterogeneity of BD across levels of analysis (e.g., genetic, molecular, psychological, clinical). Until recently, it was not clear how heterogeneity should best be measured or conceptualized,2,3 thereby limit\u00ad ing our ability to understand the diversity of BD in a holis\u00ad tic sense. In addition to these recent advancements in heterogeneity measurement,4,5 understanding the diversity of BD requires us to develop research strategies and meth\u00ad ods specific to this purpose. In this editorial, we argue that understanding the diversity of BD involves characterizing its nature, causes and conse\u00ad quences. The nature of diversity refers to the different ways in which BD can manifest. The causes of heterogeneity are the mechanisms by which diversity itself arises in BD. Finally, the consequences of diversity are the effects on man\u00ad agement, diagnosis and understanding of BD attributable to the condition\u2019s heterogeneity. We propose a framework for understanding heterogeneity in BD by inducing principles of diversity from other disciplines \u2014 chiefly statistical conserva\u00ad tion ecology, which is concerned with the analysis of the na\u00ad ture, mechanisms and consequences of biodiversity.6 This framework involves the pursuit and integration of 6 meth\u00ad odological solutions, akin to the stages proposed by Robins and Guze,7 which we summarize using the acronym \u201cFIELDS\u201d: family studies, interventional studies, environ\u00ad mental characterization, longitudinal studies, detailed multi\u00ad modal phenotyping, and statistical and computational advances. Ultimately, we hope this roadmap will help us under stand the remarkable diversity of BD. Nature of heterogeneity in bipolar disorder",

Existing studies of heterogeneity in BD tend to focus on variability or clustering along a limited number of features or domains.2 However, identifying heterogeneity across a limited number of features does not necessarily help us characterize the overall heterogeneity of BD across levels of analysis (e.g., genetic, molecular, psychological, clinical). Until recently, it was not clear how heterogeneity should best be measured or conceptualized,2,3 thereby limit ing our ability to understand the diversity of BD in a holis tic sense. In addition to these recent advancements in heterogeneity measurement,4,5 understanding the diversity of BD requires us to develop research strategies and meth ods specific to this purpose.\nIn this editorial, we argue that understanding the diversity of BD involves characterizing its nature, causes and conse quences. The nature of diversity refers to the different ways in which BD can manifest. The causes of heterogeneity are the mechanisms by which diversity itself arises in BD. Finally, the consequences of diversity are the effects on man agement, diagnosis and understanding of BD attributable to the condition\u2019s heterogeneity. We propose a framework for understanding heterogeneity in BD by inducing principles of diversity from other disciplines \u2014 chiefly statistical conserva tion ecology, which is concerned with the analysis of the na ture, mechanisms and consequences of biodiversity.6 This framework involves the pursuit and integration of 6 meth odological solutions, akin to the stages proposed by Robins and Guze,7 which we summarize using the acronym \u201cFIELDS\u201d: family studies, interventional studies, environ mental characterization, longitudinal studies, detailed multi modal phenotyping, and statistical and computational advances. Ultimately, we hope this roadmap will help us under stand the remarkable diversity of BD.\nNature of heterogeneity in bipolar disorder\nOne can show that the proper measure of heterogeneity is the effective number of configurations in which one can find a system.2,4,8 Here, our system of interest consists of randomly sampled individuals with BD. Now we must ask, \u201cwhat con stitutes a \u2018configuration\u2019?\u201d In other words, what feature(s) must we record to identify different BD phenotypes uniquely? Ecologists may label organisms in an environment with their taxonomic classes, which implies that the species label of any given organism is the relevant configuration along which organisms vary. Ecologists would then measure the heterogeneity of an ecosystem as the effective number of species. However, ecologists often use more complex config uration identifiers, such as organisms\u2019 functional properties and genotypes. Configuration labels can be multidimen sional, and they can also be continuous, discrete, or both. What matters is that one\u2019s configuration definition includes all relevant information necessary to quantify variation. In this section, we argue that relevant configurations of BD re quire measuring features across multiple levels of analysis, from genotypic and family history data to clinical presenta tions and environmental differences."

Still, distinct multivariate combinations of genetic risk variants may better characterize subgroups of these cohorts.15 Novel analytical approaches, such as MiXeR, which attempt to quantify polygenic overlap beyond linear correlation,13,16 may help us to identify distinct multivariate genetic profiles within the broad class of patients diagnosed with BD. Notwithstanding, phenotypic heterogeneity makes it difficult to infer the genetic architec ture of psychopathology based on GWAS data alone.17"

These systems may shed light on many aspects of BD, from its genetic overlap with schizophrenia to the mechanisms of mood stabilizers and calcium channel antagonists, and the neurobiology of hippocampal and cognitive impair ments.20\u201323 Importantly, second messenger signalling cas cades are likely to change in a mood state\u2013dependent fash ion, which would necessitate longitudinal measurements.24 Extensive variability in the expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) across brain regions and studies may also be a salient form of biological heterogeneity in BD.25 Given their putative involvement in synaptic plasticity, miRNAs may be of particular relevance toward understanding the trans lational neurobiology of BD.25\nSynaptic, cellular, circuit and structural heterogeneity\nMany lines of evidence suggest that changes in synaptic plas ticity contribute to the pathophysiology of BD and its treat ment.26 These include variations in dendritic branching, length and spine density27,28 as well as lithiuminduced changes in synaptic plasticity (for example, altering the syn aptic AMPA\u2013NMDA receptor ratio).29 Dentate gyrus granule celllike neurons cultured from induced pluripotent stem cells of patients with BD suggest hyperexcitability of gluta matergic cells in patients with BD compared with healthy controls.30 This hyperexcitability may be reversed by expos ure to the mood stabilizer to which a given patient was clin ically responsive.\nLargescale studies have shown that BD is associated with reductions in the volume of the hippocampus, amygdala, thalamus, left pars opercularis, left fusiform gyrus and left rostral middle frontal cortex, and increased ventricle volume compared with healthy controls, albeit with significant heterogeneity (ranging from 19.4% for amygdalar volume to 65.4% for lateral ventricular volume).31,32 Cohorts with BD also show compromised white matter integrity.33 A substan tial amount of heterogeneity may be related to medication use, illness duration, number of episodes and familial pat terns of genetic risk.34\nFunctional neuroimaging studies have consistently shown increased limbic region activity during emotional processing tasks and reduced connectivity between the amygdala and prefrontal cortical regions.35,36 However, there is considerable diversity in findings across studies, depending on mood state, experimental conditions (e.g., resting state v. task based) and illness stage.35,36"

Corticosteroid therapy has wellknown adverse effects of hypomania/mania or depression, depending on treatment duration.37 Bipolar disorder is also associated with cortisol nonsuppression on the dexamethasone suppression test and elevated diurnal cortisol secretion that may be asso ciated with symptom profiles and lithium responsiveness.38\nCircadian abnormalities are also relevant for BD, which reliably shows variations in sleep/wake cycle, activity, chronotype and circadian pacemaker gene mutations.39 Cir cadian abnormalities are also relevant for predicting lithium responsiveness.39\nMetabolic and immunological factors are relevant for under standing the etiology and progression of BD as well as the striking correlations between BD and obesity,40 insulin re sistance or diabetes mellitus,41 and cardiovascular mortality.42 Patients with BD and comorbid insulin resistance or diabetes mellitus show a higher prevalence of rapid cycling, chronic course, lithium nonresponse, functional impairment, smaller hippocampal volumes and neuronal loss.41,43,44 Immuno logic al and inflammatory factors may be a link between BD and metabolic disorders.45\nThe gut microbiome may distinguish patients with BD from those with unipolar depression and healthy controls.46 Further, probands and unaffected relatives show similar gut microbiome composition that differs from nonpsychiatric controls.47 Investigations into microbiome differences in BD reveal associations with clinical dimensions. For instance, the fractional representation of the bacterium Faecalibac terium in individuals with BD negatively correlates with the severity of illness.48 Gut microbiomics in BD is a relatively new field, but preliminary results suggest probiotic treat ment could improve cognitive function49 and reduce rehos pitalization rates.50\nJ Psychiatry Neurosci 2022;47(5) E361"

            "text": "The development and expression of BD may be influenced significantly by environmental factors, such as light expos ure, which may mediate variation in age of onset, suicidality and symptom burden/severity.39,55 Other geographically varying factors, such as cultural practices and beliefs related to mental illness, differential access to mental health ser vices, or availability of substances, may also help explain the wide variation in global BD prevalence (ranging from 0.3% in Asia to 1.6% in South America56). Gestational infections, maternal smoking, birth complications, childhood trauma and various life events may also affect the course of illness in BD.57 In particular, childhood trauma is associated with an earlier onset, rapid cycling, lifetime suicidality, substance misuse and a larger number of lifetime mood episodes, par ticularly in females.57\nCauses of heterogeneity in bipolar disorder\nThe causes of heterogeneity in BD include endogenous fac tors (internal to the individual) and exogenous factors (exter nal to the individual). These are further subdivided accord ing to the mechanistic processes by which they generate heterogeneity. Here, we subdivide heterogeneitygenerating mechanisms according to a common ecological frame work.58\u201360 Specifically, we consider allopatric, parapatric and sympatric diversity generators.\nAllopatric diversity generators separate a population into discrete subgroups that progressively diverge thereafter. En dogenous allopatric diversity generators in BD may include polygenic variation with discrete effects, sex differences and comorbidities, such as traumatic brain injuries or language disorders. Exogenous iatrogenic sources may include varia tions in diagnostic practices and treatment exposure. Exo genous noniatrogenic sources may include major adverse life events or occupational choices, such as shift work. Discrete differences in geographic distributions may also induce di versity by limiting access to health care resources.\nParapatric diversity generators apply positive selection to the extremes of some continuously varying traits and negative selection to intermediate phenotypes, yielding 2 discretely\nseparated groups. Endogenous parapatric diversity genera tors in BD may include continuous liability due to small addi tive genetic effects. Variation in personality structure may predispose some to substance use disorders,61 which could alter the clinical course of BD. Exogenous iatrogenic sources may involve variation in the importance assigned to specific features of the BD syndrome, resulting in diagnostic hetero gen eity. An example of an exogenous noniatrogenic source is that of solar insolation gradients.39,55\nSympatric diversity generators are more difficult to under stand and detect, as they involve ostensibly spontaneous emergence of a distinct phenotype from an otherwise homo geneous baseline group. One possible endogenous sympatric diversity generator is the effect of de novo rare variants across generations. The formation and dissolution of social communities could be an important sympatric diversity gen erator in the modern era. The increased time spent online, coupled with stigma, social polarization dynamics and social contagion effects, may cause patients with BD to join real world or online communities with distinct or isolated subcul tures. Some groups offer positive connections and support, while others may produce, exacerbate, or reinforce maladap tive beliefs or behaviours.62\nThe allopatric, parapatric and sympatric diversity genera tion framework is imperfect.58 However, it is a useful starting point to glean 2 fundamental principles: diversity is a phe nomenon that evolves by the interaction of multiple different variables, both endogenous and exogenous to the individual.\nConsequences of heterogeneity in bipolar disorder\nIllness progression and natural history\nIndividuals with diverse BD phenotypes may adapt to widely varying circumstances in their environments, which may feed back to alter their phenotype. These changing phe notypic profiles will need to adapt further to continuously changing environments, perpetuating this cycle of divergent illness progression across patients. For example, patients di agnosed with mixed features may be more likely to receive treatment with atypical antipsychotics.63 Individuals receiv ing such treatments may experience variable patterns of func tional limitations and illness progression through insulin re sistance, inflammation and structural brain abnormalities.41,43"

Since genetic variation is a major contributor to allopatric and parapatric diversity generators, we must seek to design research that controls for this factor. Although largescale molecular genetic approaches have made impor tant contributions to our understanding of the genetic archi tecture of psychiatric disorders, they can typically account only for the additive effects of common variants. Conversely, since relatives share larger aspects of their genetic architec ture, including nonadditive genetic effects, family studies allow us to begin with more homogeneous initial conditions from which phenotypic diversity may evolve. To this end, it\nwill be important to conduct family studies with relatives both concordant and discordant for various illness character istics and to measure such variation over time."

Specifically, concerning understanding the diversity of BD, interventional studies may help us simulate an analogous situation to the ecological phenomenon of \u201csecondary contact,\u201d whereby the reunion of 2 groups with a common ancestor tests whether species divergence has occurred. Analogously, we may be interested in the degree to which phenotypic variation in BD is stable/permanent or whether the ongoing presence of modifiable factors maintains this diversity.\nFor example, one may combine longitudinal and interven tional protocols to study the evolution of phenotypic divers ity in a sample of patients with BD who were phenotypically or genetically similar at the outset of their disease, showed phenotypic divergence over time, and are subsequently ex posed to a randomized treatment trial. Suppose phenotypic diversity pretreatment is the product of ongoing modifiable\nJ Psychiatry Neurosci 2022;47(5) E363\ndisease activity without fundamental divergence in illness trajectories. In that case, phenotypic diversity should decline after successful treatment, and patients\u2019 disease courses should subsequently evolve more homogeneously. So long as the outcome defining the success of the homogenizing inter vention is nontrivial (e.g., a sustained period of euthymia with concordant phenotypic profiles), such trials may also help us understand the diversity of BD by comparing the de gree to which medication responsiveness diverges over time within and across individuals."

To better understand this, we must embrace protocols involving collection of multi modal data that facilitate discovery of causal mechan isms spanning levels of analysis. An example of such a pro ject is the Pharmacogenomics of Bipolar Disorder study.68 Simultaneously, we must bring together clinical and basic scientists, as well as computational modelling groups to in vestigate the causal mechanisms underlying covariation be tween features at lower levels of analysis. For instance, neuro imaging researchers have begun evaluating drivers of brain structural diversity in psychiatric disorders, finding important links to metabolic abnormalities.69 Several groups have also proposed computational models to explain mech anistic variation in mood and activity levels over time in BD.70 Such studies, if sufficiently constrained by highquality data, will make important contributions toward understand ing the causal mechanisms underlying the diversity of BD."

            "text": "By drawing inspiration from ecological biodiversity studies, we can devise approaches for studying the nature, causes and consequences of heterogeneity in BD. First, we must progressively refine the precision and depth with which we characterize the BD phenotype. The resulting phenotypic profiles will be multidimensional and dynamic, and span multiple levels of analysis. Second, we must further study the general mechanisms by which phenotypic diversity itself can be generated over time, both within and across individuals. The allopatric, parapatric and sympatric mech anism classes are one such ecological approach, but they are imperfect and should be refined to suit the study of BD. Third, we must better characterize the consequences arising from the diversity of BD. This may include challenges re lated to diagnosis and management and positive feedback effects, whereby phenotypic diversity generates further phenotypic diversity in a compounded fashion. Finally, we must ensure that our experimental designs and supporting technologies are suitable for capturing the mechanisms of diversity evolution in BD. We proposed the 6 simulta neously implemented FIELDS domains. Ultimately, how ever, research specifically focused on the nature, causes and consequences of diversity in BD is in its early stages. Thus, we must refine these suggestions through further testing and experience.\nE364 J Psychiatry Neurosci 2022;47(5)\nAffiliations: From the Department of Psychiatry, Dalhousie Univer sity, Halifax, NS (Nunes, Scott, Alda); and the Faculty of Computer Science, Dalhousie University, Halifax, NS (Nunes).\nCompeting interests: None declared.\nFunding: A.
