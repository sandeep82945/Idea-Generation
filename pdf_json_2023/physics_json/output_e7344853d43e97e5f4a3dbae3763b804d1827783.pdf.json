    "abstractText": "Since the ethanol extract of Alisma orientale Juzepzuk (EEAO) suppresses lung inflammation by suppressing Nuclear Factor-kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and activating Nuclear Factor Erythroid 2-related Factor 2 (Nrf2), we set out to identify chemicals constituting EEAO that suppress lung inflammation. Here, we provide evidence that among the five most abundant chemical constituents identified by Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR), alismol is one of the candidate constituents that suppresses lung inflammation in a lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute lung injury (ALI) mouse model and protects mice from ALI-like symptoms. Alismol did not induce cytotoxicity or reactive oxygen species (ROS). When administered to the lung of LPS-induced ALI mice (n = 5/group), alismol decreased the level of neutrophils and of the pro-inflammatory molecules, including Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha (TNF-\u03b1), Interleukin-1 beta (IL-1\u03b2), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), Monocyte Chemoattractant Protein-1 (MCP-1), Interferon-gamma (IFN\u03b3), and Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2), suggesting an anti-inflammatory activity of alismol. Consistent with these findings, alismol ameliorated the key features of the inflamed lung of ALI, such as high cellularity due to infiltrated inflammatory cells, the development of hyaline membrane structure, and capillary destruction. Unlike EEAO, alismol did not suppress NF-\u03baB activity but rather activated Nrf2. Consequently, alismol induced the expression of prototypic genes regulated by Nrf2, including Heme Oxygenase-1 (HO-1), NAD(P)H: quinine oxidoreductase-1 (NQO-1), and glutamyl cysteine ligase catalytic units (GCLC). Alismol activating Nrf2 appears to be associated with a decrease in the ubiquitination of Nrf2, a key suppressive mechanism for Nrf2 activity. Together, our results suggest that alismol is a chemical constituent of EEAO that contributes at least in part to suppressing some of the key features of ALI by activating Nrf2.",

            "text": "Acute lung injury (ALI) is one of the most serious inflammatory lung diseases, featuring severe hypoxemia, diffused neutrophilic infiltration to the lung, alveolar\u2013capillary damage, and a reduction in pulmonary compliance [1]. Although diverse insults can cause ALI, bacterial sepsis is regarded as one of the most common causes of ALI [2,3]. As for treatments, antimicrobial therapy, ventilation, and other supportive care have been known to help improve the survival of ALI patients [4]. However, the mortality remains high, at approximately 40% [5]. One of the main reasons for high mortality is attributable to no effective therapeutics available to treat ALI [4].\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 15573. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms242115573 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 15573 2 of 15\nThe key factor in bacterial sepsis is bacterial endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS), which is closely associated with the development of ALI [3,5]. The lungs of ALI patients produce various pro-inflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) and Interleukin-1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2) [6], whose production is regulated by LPS binding to TLR4 [7]. Signaling initiated by TLR4 leads to the activation of NF-\u03baB, which results in the production of inflammatory cytokines that exacerbate the symptoms of ALI [7]. Therefore, therapeutic strategies have targeted suppressing TLR4 signaling, NF-\u03baB activity, or the downstream signaling triggered by the inflammatory cytokines [8]. However, these therapeutic strategies have shown limited success [8], suggesting the complexity of inflammation and the necessity of diverse therapeutic approaches. For instance, in addition to NF-\u03baB activation, TLR4 signaling activated by LPS also triggers the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can contribute to tissue damage, furthering inflammation and the symptoms of ALI [9]. As a countermeasure to the deleterious ROS, cells can activate nuclear factor-E2-related factor 2 (Nrf2) [10], a transcription factor that regulates the expression of NAD(P)H: quinine oxidoreductase-1 (NQO-1), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1), and glutamyl cysteine ligase catalytic units (GCLC) [11], which are involved in removing and guarding against the harmful effects of ROS. Since studies with Nrf2 knock-out mice have shown a critical role of Nrf2 in protecting mice from ALI [12,13], Nrf2 can be another therapeutic target for treating ALI [14,15]. In traditional Asian medicine, the tuber of Alisma orientale Juzepzuk has been prescribed to treat diseases accompanied by edema and inflammation [16]. Accordingly, we have shown that the ethanol extract of A. orientale (EEAO) suppresses lung inflammation in an LPS-induced ALI mouse model [17,18]. EEAO can suppress NF-\u03baB activity and concurrently activate Nrf2, both of which were proposed as attributing factors for EEAO to suppress lung inflammation and ALI [18]. In this study, we attempted to find chemical constituents of EEAO that play a role in suppressing lung inflammation. We identified the five most abundant chemical constituents in EEAO by UPLC and NMR analyses and tested whether they have anti-inflammatory activity. Here, we present evidence that among the five abundant chemicals, alismol is one of the chemical constituents of EEAO that plays a role in suppressing neutrophilic lung inflammation manifested in LPS-induced ALI mice. Additionally, we present results indicating that alismol activates Nrf2, which is consistent with EEAO activating Nrf2."

Fingerprinting analysis of the extract revealed five major peaks, each of which was purified and tested for anti-inflammatory activity. Given that EEAO suppresses NF-\u03baB activity and activates Nrf2 [18], we tested whether the chemicals affect NF-\u03baB or Nrf2 activities by using an Nrf2-dependent luciferase reporter cell line [19] and an NF-kB-dependent luciferase cell line [20], respectively. The preliminary results obtained from the screening experiment suggested that the number 3 peak is a possible anti-inflammatory molecule. Since liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC\u2013MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses identified the peak as alismol (Figure 1A), we tested whether alismol could suppress lung inflammation in an LPS-induced ALI mouse model. At the onset of this study, we first determined a cellular toxicity caused by alismol. RAW 264.7 cells were treated with increasing amounts of alismol up to 10\u22125 M, and any cellular toxicity was measured by MTT assay. As shown in Figure 1B, alismol did not show toxicity. In addition, we measured the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) triggered by alismol, as ROS cause cellular damage, contributing to inflammation [9]. RAW 264.7 cells were treated with vehicle (DMSO 0.01% final), LPS (0.1 \u00b5g/mL), or alismol (10 \u00b5M final) for 16 h, and intracellular ROS were measured by FACS.

Histologic analyses show that, as opposed to PBS-treated control lung (Figure 5A), an i.t. LPS injection induced cellular infiltration to the lung, along with hyaline membrane structure (Figure 5B), which developed during acute lung inflammation [26,27]. However, alismol suppressed the cellular infiltration and the formation of the hyaline membrane structure in ALI mice (Figure 5C,D). Next, we collected BALF from the inflamed mice treated with or without alismol and measured blood albumin, indicative of capillary leakage caused by lung tissue damage [27]. As shown in Figure 5E, unlike PBS-treated mice, the level of blood albumin was increased in the LPS-treated lungs (first and second columns), which was, however, suppressed by alismol treatments (third and fourth columns), suggesting that alismol ameliorates tissue damage was caused by LPS.

As shown in Figure 6A and 6B, alismol did not affect the nuclear localization of NF-\u03baB, suggesting that the anti-inflammatory activity shown by alismol was not related to regulating NF-\u03baB activity. Similarly, we tested whether alismol affected the expression of A20, a cytoplasmic ubiquitin-modulating protein that suppresses multiple inflammatory signaling pathways [30]. RAW 264.7 cells were similarly treated with alismol for 16 h, and cytoplasmic proteins were fractionated and analyzed by Western blotting for A20. As shown in Figure 6C and 6D, alismol did not induce the expression of A20, suggesting that A20 was not the factor that alismol utilized to suppress inflammation. Next, we tested whether alismol suppressed inflammation by activating Nrf2, a transcription factor that contributes to down-regulating inflammatory response [13] and becomes activated by EEAO [18]. RAW 264.7 cells were treated with alismol, as described above. The nuclear fraction was fractionated and analyzed by Western blotting for Nrf2, as Nrf2, when activated, moves to the nucleus [31,32]. As shown in Figure 7A and 7B, as low as 10\u22127 M of alismol could activate Nrf2. To confirm that alismol activated Nrf2, we examined whether alismol suppressed the ubiquitination of Nrf2 to activate Nrf2, given that Nrf2 became inactivated by ubiquitination [15]. HEK 293 cells were transfected with plasmids encoding V5-tagged Nrf2, Flag-tagged Keap1, and HA-tagged ubiquitin. The transfected cells were treated with two different amounts of alismol for 16 h. Two hours before cell harvest, MG132 was added to the cells to preserve ubiquitinated proteins. From a total cell lysate, Nrf2 was precipitated by an anti-V5 antibody, and the status of the ubiquitination of Nrf2 was revealed by Western blotting for HA-ubiquitin. As a ubiquitin assay (Figure 7C) and a densitometric analysis (Figure 7D) show, while the presence of Keap1 heavily ubiquitinated Nrf2 (lane 2), alismol treatment suppressed it (lanes 3 and 4). Concurrent with these findings, quantitative RT-PCR analyses show that alismol induced the expression of HO-1 (Figure 7E), GCLC (Figure 7F), and NQO-1 (Figure 7G), prototypic genes, whose expression is regulated by Nrf2. Therefore, our results indicate that alismol can activate Nrf2 by blocking the ubiquitination of Nrf2, suggesting that alismol activating Nrf2 is, at least in part, accountable for the suppression of lung inflammation by alismol.\nInt.

            "text": "Since the tuber of Alisma orientale Juzepzuk has been prescribed to relieve inflammatory symptoms [16], and the ethanol extract of A. orientale (EEAO) suppressed lung inflammation in an LPS-induced ALI mouse model [17,18], the herb likely contains chemicals as its constituents that exert an anti-inflammatory effect. Thus, in this study, we set out to identify the chemical constituents accountable for this effect. EEAO was subjected to UPLC analysis, from which five major peaks were selected and tested for suppressing NF-\u03baB activity or activating Nrf2, given that EEAO suppresses NF-\u03baB activity as well as activates Nrf2 [18]. We found that alismol purified from EEAO was a constituent that suppressed lung inflammation and protected mice from ALI-associated lung damage. Our ALI mouse model, in which LPS was administered in aerosol to the lung, could recapitulate some of the key features of ALI. One of them is a diffused neutrophil infiltration to the lung [21]. Since neutrophil is an innate immune cell that is exclusively involved in inflammation, an influx of neutrophils to the lung is indicative of lung inflammation that occurred after LPS administration. Consistent with this notion, LPS administered to the lung also induced the production of prototypic pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, MCP-1, and IFN-\u03b3. With this mouse model, we found that a single i.t. alismol lowered the number of neutrophils in the lung cavity and consequently suppressed MPO activity, which mostly pertains to neutrophils. Alismol also decreased the levels of inflammatory cytokines and ameliorated the inflamed lung, which was infested with inflammatory cells and the hyaline membrane. Another key feature of ALI includes alveolar\u2013capillary damage in the lung [26]. In our ALI mouse model, we found that the lungs developed a capillary leakage because serum albumin was detectable in the BALF of the mouse lungs. However, when alismol was administered to the lung, alismol could reduce the level of serum albumin in BALF, suggesting that alismol protected the lung from capillary damage induced by LPS. Together, these results suggest that alismol is a constituent of EEAO that accounts for suppressing lung inflammation and lung damage. With our ALI mouse model, we showed that alismol could suppress key features of ALI. However, it was not clear how alismol exerts its effect against ALI-like symptoms. Since EEAO was reported to decrease lung inflammation and ALI by suppressing NF-\u03baB, a pro-inflammatory transcription factor, and by activating Nrf2, an anti-inflammatory transcription factor, we first examined whether alismol inhibits NF-\u03baB activity for suppressing lung inflammation and ALI. However, alismol did not suppress NF-\u03baB activity, given our results that alismol could not prevent the nuclear localization of NF-\u03baB, indicative of activated NF-\u03baB [29]. As an alternative mechanism, we explored the possibility that alismol induces the expression of A20, a ubiquitin-modulating protein that blocks multiple inflammatory pathways [33]. However, alismol did not induce the expression of A20 either. These results together suggest that alismol does not modulate NF-\u03baB for its antiinflammatory activity. Thus, we examined the possibility that alismol activates Nrf2. Our results show that alismol activated Nrf2 by decreasing the ubiquitination and thus blocking the degradation of Nrf2 [31], a key mechanism of suppressing Nrf2 activity. Consistent with this finding, alismol also supported the expression of representative genes regulated by Nrf2, including HO-1, NOQ-1, and GCLC. It is of note that alismol did not activate Nrf2 by triggering ROS production, given that ROS is a potent activator of Nrf2. Together, our results suggest that alismol prosecutes its anti-inflammatory effect by activating Nrf2. Unlike EEAO, which regulates both NF-\u03baB and Nrf2, alismol appears to activate only Nrf2. Given that EEAO contains numerous chemical constituents [34,35], it is highly likely that other chemical constituents participate in suppressing NF-\u03baB activity. Interestingly, alismol activating Nrf2 seems sufficient to protect mice from ALI. Considering that Nrf2 plays a key role in ameliorating ALI [12,13] and other respiratory diseases, including asthma [36,37], the activation of Nrf2 could be potent enough to quench inflammatory reactions without additional anti-inflammatory measures, such as suppressing NF-kB. However, since we tested only a few pathways that could affect inflammation and ALI, the possibility that alismol also activates other anti-inflammatory or suppresses other\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 15573 11 of 15\npro-inflammatory pathways cannot be excluded. For instance, alismol decreased the production of IFN-\u03b3 in ALI mouse lungs, suggesting the possibility that alismol is involved in regulating IFN-\u03b3 expression. Since the expression of IFN-\u03b3 is regulated by several transcription factors, including ATF-2 [38], AP-1, or CREB/ATF2 [39], alismol may suppress the activities of these transcription factors, resulting in the decreased production of IFN\u03b3. Alternatively, given that complicated multi-layered mechanisms, including epigenetic regulation, are involved in the transcriptional regulation of IFN-\u03b3 [40], it is also possible that alismol interferes with some of the epigenetic regulations required for the production of IFN-\u03b3. Regardless, the precise mechanisms exerted by alismol can be elucidated only if molecular targets of alismol are fully uncovered. The target molecules can be deduced by pharmacologic modeling approaches, in which the molecular structure of alismol is used as a bait for proteins that exhibit a calculated high affinity with a structural match. Nevertheless, we identified alismol as a chemical constituent of EEAO that activated Nrf2 by blocking the ubiquitination. Given the anti-inflammatory function of Nrf2, we propose that alismol is one of the constituting molecules of EEAO, contributing to the suppression of lung inflammation and ALI."
