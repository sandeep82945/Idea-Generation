ABSTRACT Objective This scoping review of reviews aims to describe the current landscape of measures of emotional wellbeing (EWB). Methods Following established practices for scoping reviews, we searched the PsycInfo, ERIC, Scopus and PubMed databases in June and July 2021 for reviews of measures of EWB that described their review methods and psychometric properties of included measures. From each eligible article, two coders independently extracted the authors\u2019 (1) definition of EWB, (2) purpose for the review, (3) methods (eg, search terms, inclusion and exclusion criteria), (4) identified measures (including any noted adaptations) and (5) the scope of psychometric information presented. Descriptive and content analyses were used to examine data. Results Fortynine reviews were included in this scoping review. Reviews included anywhere between 1 and 34 measures of EWB and 135 unique EWB measures were captured across all reviews. We found that there was no consistent definition of EWB, identified measures varied widely and reviews were published in a range of disciplines. Psychometric evidence varied as did authors\u2019 purposes for conducting the reviews. Conclusions Overall, these reviews suggest that literature on EWB measurement is disjointed and diffuse. Conceptual integration and harmonisation of measures is needed to advance knowledge of EWB and its measurement. Trial registration numbers 10.17605/OSF.IO/BQDS7 and 10.17605/OSF.IO/WV8PF.",

Published by BMJ.\nWell- being is multidimensional, with reference to a broad range of indicators deemed important to population health. Emotional well- being (EWB) is recognised as one of those dimensions. High levels of EWB have been associated with physical health, healthy ageing and longevity.1\u20135 Given global reports of low scores on well- being indicators such as quality of life, social integration and life satisfaction, EWB has been elevated as a recommended public health target within a nation\u2019s priorities in the service of advancing well- being.6 Consistent with this priority, there has been a proliferation of theories, constructs and measures in the EWB domain.\nMany conceptualisations of the EWB exist, with variations based on researchers' training or particular areas of interest. EWB research is conducted across many disciplines, each of which has its own history of terminology. As such, the current landscape of EWB research is diverse, leaving challenges in communication and dissemination, which makes it difficult to target EWB as a public health priority.\nEfforts of researchers to establish a working definition of EWB acknowledge that EWB comprises how positive an individual feels generally and about life overall.7 This working definition embraces both experiential and reflective features, and reflects focus on the positive continuum as distinguished from features of distress and dysfunction. The working definition further articulates the importance of acknowledging interpretation within the context of culture, life circumstances, resources and life course. For example, the salience of various facets of EWB may vary across cultures or across the lifespan.7 In collectivist cultures or those with a strong emphasis on family, social features (eg, the health and well- being of loved ones) may greatly influence how an individual feels generally and about life overall.8 Those in\nSTRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY \u21d2 All stages of the review process (ie, title and abstract screening, full- text review, extraction, measure inclusion and exclusion) were completed using independent double coding; consensus was reached on all decisions. \u21d2 Our study captured reviews across several disciplines. This demonstrates not only widespread interest in emotional well- being (EWB), but also disparate conversations occurring across fields. \u21d2 Our study is limited in that we did not conduct a critical appraisal of the included articles or measures. \u21d2 Articles and measures\u2019 varied definitions of EWB complicated precise identification of measures of EWB.\non January 16, 2024 by guest.

Similarly, the reflective features (eg, life satisfaction, sense of meaning) described in this definition may be less salient for young children or those with cognitive impairments (eg, dementia, intellectual disabilities). For these populations, the experiential features characterised in this working definition may be more pertinent.\nMeasurement represents one important path to elevating the importance of EWB in overall population health. That is, understanding what comprises the EWB construct and how EWB measured is critical to driving policy and programme decisions to enhance EWB. Work on EWB as a whole, however, is fairly recent and thus plagued by limited consensus as to how EWB should be measured. Subjective, neuroimaging and psychophysiological approaches have been explored, yet to date, subjective reports dominate the literature given factors such as ease with which data can be gathered and historical emphasis.9 Subjective report refers to an individual\u2019s evaluation of a construct of interest. The constructs of interest could be as simple as a single item global evaluation of quality of life or may be multiple items designed to tap separate aspects of EWB. The target of evaluation could be the self or other, such as a parent completing a scale regarding their child\u2019s affect. The name subjective report implies a leaning toward subjectivity versus objectivity in measurement, which has been discussed as potentially appropriate given that the values placed on different life circumstances are evaluated by individuals in different ways.9 As an example, one individual may place greater personal value on family whereas another may value independence, and thus, their subjective evaluation about quality of life may be influenced by these values.10 In addition, the period of retrospection may vary across subjective reports, such as asking a respondent to report on how one feels right now versus over the past week generally. Shorter periods of retrospection have been described as potentially lending greater objectivity to the evaluations.9 10 Overall, the focus of EWB subjective measurement research has been more heavily directed toward reflective (ie, evaluative) than experiential (ie, hedonic) features.11 Yet growing interest in understanding the unique and overlapping contributions of both reflective and experiential features, coupled with the confusing, broad landscape of EWB terminology, supports the need for systematic evaluation as to what reviews of EWB subjective measures are available, and what information has structured and been captured in those reviews.\nThe purpose of this paper was to conduct a scoping review of existing reviews of EWB subjective report measures. Conceptual and methodological clarity for conducting scoping reviews has emerged over the past two decades.12\u201315 As described by Colquhoun and colleagues, a scoping review is \u2018a form of knowledge synthesis that addresses an exploratory research question aimed at mapping key concepts, types of evidence and gaps in\nresearch related to a defined area or field by systematically searching, selecting and synthesizing existing knowledge\u2019 (Colquhoun et al, pp. 1292\u20131294).14\nAligned with these goals, our scoping review aims to serve multiple purposes that offer implications to advance the science and communication of EWB. First, we aim to shed light on the extant of EWB measurement landscape by identifying and documenting which subjective EWB measures exist and in what disciplines they have been developed and used. Second, we aim to catalogue information on existing definitions of EWB that can spur advances in consensus of what EWB is and is not. For this purpose, we identify how EWB was defined in each review. Third, we aim to identify the scope of psychometric information presented in reviews as well as the reported adaptations of included measures. Finally, we aim to advance development of new EWB measures by sharing what commonalities and differences are present in the methods that have been used to conduct past reviews of EWB measures, such as decisions surrounding eligibility criteria, to potentially shed light on the reason for variation in measures."

Our four aims organise a rigorous and transparent methodological approach to knowledge synthesis focused on mapping current concepts, types of evidence and gaps in research. We preregistered our study through the Open Science Framework (two registrations made, with the second registration for additional search terms; see Abstract section). Deviations have been recorded with OSF and include minor revision of the second and third research questions in response to information available in included reviews.\nInformation sources and search strategy After consulting with a research librarian, the team searched the PsycInfo, ERIC, Scopus and PubMed databases on 10 June 2021 and 1 July 2021. A main purpose of this scoping review was to identify and document the range of EWB conceptualisations across literatures. Thus, as recommended when completing a scoping review,13 we used a broad range of search terms related to EWB to capture as many potentially relevant articles as we could. Described later, we then applied strict inclusion and exclusion criteria to narrow in on articles of interest. To identify reviews of measures, we also included search terms related to measurement and literature reviews, resulting in search terms related to (a) EWB, (b) measurement and (c) literature reviews.

In addition, articles were limited to those published in peerreviewed journals, published in English and published in the year 2000 or later. As long as the full- text article was available in English, articles originating in any nation were included. No limits were placed on the population (eg, age or clinical/non- clinical population) reported in reviews. Exclusion criteria included: (1) book chapters; (2) book reviews, case studies, qualitative studies; (3) unavailable full texts or abstract- only papers; (4) articles published in dissertations, theses, conference papers or opinion/perspective papers and (5) articles only focused on health- related quality of life (HRQOL). We excluded grey literature because we were interested in literature with high credibility and high outlet control17 (ie, the extent to which content is produced using explicit and transparent knowledge creation criteria) as this is most likely the knowledge informing EWB research.\nWe conceptualise EWB as a construct that can be measured in general populations and not only those experiencing health conditions or specific life events. We consulted with subject matter experts, who included diverse members of six networks funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) to advance research on EWB, NIH programme staff and external advisory board members of individual networks. Experts had clinical and academic training. Two structured response sessions were held; our team presented the variety of terms we were encountering in the literature and solicited feedback from experts on their conceptual links to EWB. Experts discussed the relevance and history of these terms and made recommendations about their conceptual links to EWB. Based on the outcomes of these discussions, we deemed reviews of well- being, emotional well- being, mental well- being, psychological well- being, mental health and well- being, quality of life, wellness, life satisfaction, psychosocial health, child mental health and community health and wellbeing to be \u2018conceptually linked\u2019 to EWB.

As a result of this process, 94 articles were retained for full- text screening. Next, the full text of each article was independently reviewed by two trained coders. Again, any discrepancies were resolved by the first author or the first and last authors. Forty- five studies were excluded at this stage (reasons outlined in figure 1).

On closer inspection \u2018generic QOL\u2019 measures were often HRQOL measures intended to be used with any disease population rather than a specific disease population. In these cases, the reviews were excluded because they focused on HRQOL measures (sometimes along with disease- specific measures).21 22 Two articles indicated that tables of psychometric information were available on request; we did not receive responses to our requests for these tables and therefore excluded the articles for their lack of inclusion of psychometric information.

To answer research question 1, we counted the number of reviews, the number of measures within each review and the total number of measures captured across reviews. In addition, using the citations of each article, we used the Web of Science Master Journal List23 to capture the disciplinary focus of each journal. When journals were indexed in both the Web of Science Social Sciences Citation Index (SSCI) and Science Citation Index Expanded, we used the journal category(ies) identified in the SSCI. Three journals (ie, Innovations in Clinical Neuroscience, Reviews in Clinical Gerontology and Folia Medica) were not indexed by the Web of Science; in these cases, the first and last authors reviewed the aims and scope of each journal to identify corresponding Web of Science categories.

To answer research question 2, we used directed content analysis24 to code authors\u2019 approach to defining EWB or related constructs. First, the extraction of the authors\u2019 purpose for conducting the review was used to determine if a goal of the review was to examine definitions or conceptualisations of EWB. If examining definitions was not a review goal, extraction of the EWB definition content from the article was coded as either providing a single definition, presenting multiple definitions or not specifying a definition. For articles in the single definition category, we also coded whether the definition provided was the World Health Organization's (WHO) definition of quality of life25 because this definition was consistently observed across articles.\nResearch question 3: what is the scope of validation information and adaptations in existing reviews of EWB measures? To answer research question 3, we assessed the number of studies that provided psychometric evidence in a table, the narrative or both; the level of detail of this evidence (ie, global summaries, detailed psychometrics or global summaries with a few examples).

These review articles contained between 1 and 34 EWB measures (M=5.27, SD=6.10). A total of 135 measures of EWB were captured across the review articles (see online supplemental appendix A for complete list). The Satisfaction with Life Scale27 (included in 14 articles) and World Health Organization Quality of Life- Brief Version (WHOQOL- BREF;28 included in 13 articles) were the most commonly reported measures.\nAuthors\u2019 purposes for conducting their reviews varied widely. Only 20.4% (n=10) of the 49 articles were broad reviews of instruments that did not focus on a specific population. Close to half (n=22; 44.9%) of the articles looked for measures that could be used with a specific health population (eg, diabetes, dementia, intellectual disabilities). Approximately one- third (n=17; 34.7%) of the articles focused on a specific developmental period (ie, children, adolescents or older people). A smaller number of articles concentrated on one specific instrument (n=5), caregivers (n=3) or a specific cultural population (n=2).\nTwo phenomena were observed in the included reviews of EWB measures. First, 35 reviews (71.4%) also included measures developed for specific disease populations (eg, diabetics) or HRQOL measures, making their review broader than only measures of EWB. In addition, 12 of the 49 articles (24.5%) included measures of depression, anxiety or other forms of psychopathology to assess wellbeing or QOL (ie, suggesting that well- being is indicated by the absence of psychopathology). As indicated in our Methods section, these measures were excluded from our counts of EWB measures but are noted in describing the current landscape of reviews of EWB measures.\nThe 49 articles were published in journals that represent a range of disciplines, including psychology (n=11), health policy and services (n=6) and clinical neurology\n(n=5). The disciplinary foci of journals publishing these articles are shown in table 1. We found that 35% of these reviews have been published since 2017, suggesting a surge in interest in the topic.\nIn a majority of the articles (n=43; 87.8%), the authors concluded that further development and refinement of EWB measures is needed. In addition, in nearly one- fourth of the articles (n=12; 24.5%), the authors concluded that there were inadequate or not yet sufficiently studied and validated measures available for specific patient\non January 16, 2024 by guest.

            "heading": "How EWB is defined within included reviews",
            "text": "Authors rarely used the term EWB. Fifteen (30.6%) of the 49 articles focused on mental well- being, psychosocial well- being, subjective well- being and well- being; general mental health and well- being or wellness. Twenty- five (51.0%) of the reviews focused on QOL and three (6.1%) focused on life satisfaction. The remaining six articles (12.2%) focused on behavioural and psychosocial functioning, patient reported outcomes measures, personcentred measures or positive psychology measures.\nThe definitions used to characterise EWB also varied across the reviews. Consistent with the lack of consensus in the field, one in five reviews (20%) specified that examining definitions was a goal of the review and another 6% presented multiple definitions that were relevant to measurement. Approximately half of the reviews provided a single definition (49%) and these definitions varied considerably. The WHO quality of life definition was cited most frequently, in 14% of the reviews. The WHO defines quality of life as \u2018an individual\u2019s perception of their position in life in the context of culture and value systems in which they live and in relation to their goals, expectations, standards and concerns\u2019 (Power et al, p. 1570).25 The varied definitions that were extracted from the other reviews are provided in online supplemental materials. These definitions were often multidimensional and spanned various conceptualisations of well- being, from those involving life satisfaction and affective tendencies to those encompassing self- actualisation and purpose in life. Moreover, the varied definitions were instructive with regard to measurement in different populations. For example, Newton et al29 indicate that the social and emotional well- being of Indigenous Australians \u2018not only takes into account individual functioning but also its connection to the land, culture, ancestry, spirituality, family and community and considers factors such as the collective impact of experiences such as child removals, incarceration, family breakdown, cultural dislocation, racism and social disadvantage.\u2019 (p. 41). The remaining 25% of the reviews did not provide any definition, which tended to occur in reviews narrowly focused on a particular measure or psychometric goal.\nScope of psychometric information provided Based on our inclusion criteria, all included articles provided some psychometric information about included measures. However, the level of detail in these psychometrics varied. The vast majority (98.0%; n=48) of the 49 articles provided psychometric evidence in the narrative of their article. The narratives most commonly presented global summaries (ie, synthesising results across studies; n=22; 44.9%) or global summaries with a few examples (n=15; 30.6%). Fewer than one in five articles (n=9; 18.4%)\nincluded detailed psychometrics in their narrative. The remaining articles (n=2) either listed the types of psychometric testing completed, but provided no summary, or summarised psychometric testing across measures rather than indicating what had been completed for individual measures.\nIn addition, 87.8% (n=43) of articles provided psychometric evidence in one or more tables. These tables most frequently presented global summaries (n=18; 36.7%) or detailed psychometrics (n=15; 30.6%). Less commonly, tables included global summaries with a few examples (n=6; 12.2%) or listed types of psychometric evidence without summarising any results of that testing (n=3; 6.1%). In one case, the article\u2019s table indicated whether reliability and validity evidence (grouped together) were \u2018preliminary\u2019 or \u2018satisfactory\u2019.\nForty of the 49 articles (81.7%) provided psychometric evidence in both the narrative and at least one table. Four articles provided detailed psychometrics in both their table(s) and narrative. Online supplemental appendix B includes the psychometric properties reported in each article as well as the level of detail reported in authors\u2019 narratives and tables.\nA little under half (n=23; 46.9%) of the 49 articles reported adaptations to one or more of their included EWB measures. Adaptations were most commonly an abbreviated scale (ie, fewer items), language and/or cultural adaptations or adaptations for a different population or developmental period (ie, adolescence). At least five EWB measures (ie, Control, Autonomy, SelfRealisation, Pleasure; Ryff Scales of Psychological Wellbeing; Satisfaction with Life Scale; McGill Quality of Life Questionnaire; WHOQOL- BREF) are each available in more than 10 languages."

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "This scoping review aimed to describe the current landscape of reviews of EWB measures. Following a scoping review process,15 we identified 49 reviews containing 135 unique EWB measures. Within these reviews, we found there was no consistent definition of EWB, identified measures varied widely and reviews were published in a range of disciplines. Authors commonly focused on measures for specific populations (eg, individuals with a specific disease) and reviews rarely included measures intended to be used across the life course. The scope of reviews often extended beyond EWB, most commonly including disease- specific or HRQOL measures. Reviews varied in the level of psychometric detail provided as well as the rigour of review methods. Overall, we found the literature to be quite diffuse and in need of harmonisation across definitions and measures.\nTo our knowledge, this is the first scoping review of EWB measurement reviews. Scoping reviews are often used in rapidly emerging fields,12 and the substantial number of reviews and measures included in this review demonstrates the value of a scoping review to describe the landscape of this field. Our findings on the varying definitions used to characterise EWB are consistent with prior reviews,30\u201332 but represent a much wider scope. Instead of focusing on definitions at the level of specific measures, our study examined the conceptual framework that guided each review, and thus reflected how researchers across different disciplines approach EWB measurement. Our findings suggest investigation is needed to tease apart the extent to which different terms are being applied to the same constructs (eg, EWB) and alternatively, the same terms are being applied to different constructs.33\nChallenges in defining EWB pose major obstacles to advancing the science of EWB, such as limiting comparison of findings across studies or adequate screening and assessment of EWB in applied settings. An interdisciplinary working definition of EWB, such as the one proposed by Park and colleagues,7 is likely to advance a more cohesive approach to EWB measurement. If this definition takes hold, important next steps to advance\nEWB measurement will be to identify if and how current measures align with this definition. Subsequently, measure refinement, harmonisation and comprehensive validation will be needed.9 11 The number of measures identified in this scoping review suggests that harmonisation, rather than additional proliferation, of measures is likely needed. Supporting this work, our scoping review provides a list of 135 EWB measures. We have used this list to create a free, online repository of EWB measures.34 Considering the findings of this review, when selecting measures for research or applied purposes, users should carefully consider how EWB is being conceptualised.\nAlong with the contributions of our study, several limitations should be noted. Despite our comprehensive search strategy for peer reviewed literature, examining grey literature may have generated additional insights about the landscape of EWB literature. Although we reported the psychometric properties and level of detail that each review presented, we did not complete our own independent evaluation of measures as it was beyond the scope of this study. Future research is needed to rigorously evaluate the quality of psychometric evidence available for existing EWB measures. Although we observed rigorous psychometric evaluation being conducted in some instances (eg, COSMIN checklist),26 35 36 these reviews focused on specific populations and therefore did not provide information about the psychometric adequacy of EWB measures for general populations. We also did not address intended use of each instrument (eg, screening, progress monitoring). However, our results indicated that less than half of the included reviews reported measures\u2019 sensitivity to change, which suggests a possible gap in psychometric evidence on the use of these tools for progress monitoring and assessing change due to an intervention. Despite identifying 135 measures, it was also beyond the scope of this study to identify the degree to which each of these measures or adaptations have been used. Future research could investigate the use of these measures in research and applied settings. Finally, our study was limited by the inconsistency in EWB definitions across the literature; this made it challenging to arrive at definitive statements about EWB and its measurement. We even observed instances where a measure had not been definitively named by its author37 and was subsequently given various names by review authors.31 38\nThe results of our scoping review point to several important directions for future research. Our review points to the importance of disentangling the overlap and distinctions between HRQOL and QOL measurement. As also noted by Kaplan and Hays,39 authors\u2019 application of these terms varies and contributes to challenges in identifying and applying measures, as well as comparing results across studies. Our review also suggests the importance of considering the process by which a broad definition of EWB is operationalised in measurement with different populations and in various contexts, such as considering cultural context and stages of lifespan development.

In addition, research is needed to determine if adapting adult measures for children and adolescents is an appropriate practice. Presently, the sensitivity of EWB measures and understanding of EWB trajectories in the development for child populations is unknown.40 The time scale of subjective measurement is also an important consideration in such research, as traditional questionnaire formats reviewed here are increasingly being adapted for ecological momentary assessment during daily life.41 42 We observed interest in EWB measurement across many disciplines that, with shared language and conceptualisations, hold the potential to rapidly advance our understanding of EWB.\nIn conclusion, our scoping review found that the literature on EWB measurement is disjointed and diffuse. Disciplines use varied definitions and measures of EWB, which impedes the comparison of results across studies or the application of existing measures in new settings or studies. Unified language and shared conceptualisations are essential for research findings to be synthesised, generalised and disseminated for application.33 Therefore, conceptual integration and harmonisation of measures is needed to advance knowledge of EWB and its measurement.\nAuthor affiliations 1Department of Educational Psychology, University of Connecticut, Storrs, CT, USA 2Center for Healthy Minds, University of Wisconsin- Madison, Madison, Wisconsin, USA 3Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, Bethesda, Maryland, USA 4Department of Counseling Psychology and Center for Healthy Minds, University of Wisconsin, Madison, Wisconsin, USA 5Department of Preventive Medicine, University of Tennessee Health Science Center, Memphis, TN, USA 6Department of Educational Psychology, University of Connecticut, Storrs, Connecticut, USA\nTwitter Jessica B Koslouski @jkoslouski\nAcknowledgements We acknowledge the work was initiated as part of the cross- network project meetings funded under RFA- AT- 20- 003, specifically under the Subjective Measurement subgroup.
