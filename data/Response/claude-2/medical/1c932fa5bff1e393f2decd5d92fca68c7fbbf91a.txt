 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming the paper:

1. Develop new nanomaterials for FET biosensor fabrication that have improved electrical and biological properties, such as higher conductivity, biocompatibility, and stability. This could enhance sensitivity and selectivity.

2. Optimize surface functionalization strategies to improve antibody or aptamer immobilization on the FET surface. This could improve detection limits and reproducibility. 

3. Explore multiplexed detection of a wider panel of AD biomarkers on a single FET biosensor. This could enable better diagnosis and monitoring of disease progression.

4. Integrate FET biosensors with microfluidics and nanoelectronics to create lab-on-a-chip devices for point-of-care AD diagnosis. This could enable decentralized testing.

5. Validate FET biosensors with larger clinical studies using patient samples. Perform statistical analysis to evaluate diagnostic accuracy compared to current methods like ELISA. This could accelerate adoption in clinical settings.
