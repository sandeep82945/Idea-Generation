The portion of the text mentioning future research directions is not explicitly outlined in the provided text. However, the text concludes with findings and implications that could suggest areas for future investigation, such as further exploration of penicillic acid's properties, its synthesis across different organisms, and its potential applications. Since the text primarily focuses on the study's results and implications rather than explicitly stating future research directions, extracting a direct quote on future research directions from the provided text is not feasible.
