    "abstractText": "Upregulation of glycolysis and downregulation of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, termed as the Warburg effect, are characteristic of tumor cells1,2. Restriction of pyruvate flux into the mitochondrial matrix is one of the major mechanisms underlying this phenomenon3. Warburg-type metabolism is beneficial for rapidly proliferating cells, however its function remains unclear. Moreover, it is unknown what the metabolic consequences of activation of mitochondrial respiration in Warburg-type cancer cells are. Here we created a chemogenetic instrument, Grubraw, that generates pyruvate directly in the mitochondrial matrix bypassing restricted pyruvate influx. In cancer cells, Grubraw-driven pyruvate synthesis in the matrix increased mitochondrial membrane potential, oxygen consumption rate, and the amounts of TCA cycle intermediates. In a mouse model of human melanoma xenografts, chemogenetic activation of mitochondria caused a decrease in tumor growth rate. Surprisingly, cancer cells actively exported pyruvate generated by Grubraw in the mitochondria into the extracellular medium. Our results demonstrate that cells with Warburg-type metabolism use a previously unknown mechanism of carbon flux control to dispose of excessive mitochondrial pyruvate. Main Pyruvate is one of the key molecules critical to eukaryotic metabolism as the endpoint of glycolysis and an important branching point between lactic fermentation and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). In cancer cells, pyruvate is one of the keystone molecules for metabolic reprogramming, termed the Warburg effect. Current understanding describes the Warburg phenotype as metabolic reprogramming associated with upregulation of glycolysis and downregulation of OXPHOS1,2. Carcinogenesis and the Warburg effect are frequently accompanied by decreased pyruvate entry into mitochondria via mitochondrial pyruvate (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder.

            "text": "Pyruvate is one of the key molecules critical to eukaryotic metabolism as the endpoint of glycolysis and an important branching point between lactic fermentation and oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). In cancer cells, pyruvate is one of the keystone molecules for metabolic reprogramming, termed the Warburg effect. Current understanding describes the Warburg phenotype as metabolic reprogramming associated with upregulation of glycolysis and downregulation of OXPHOS1,2. Carcinogenesis and the Warburg effect are frequently accompanied by decreased pyruvate entry into mitochondria via mitochondrial pyruvate\ncarrier (MPC)3,4. Moreover, pyruvate metabolism plays a significant role in tumor angiogenesis5, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT),the development of chemoresistance in cancer cells6, and HIF-1\u03b1 degradation inhibition under aerobic conditions7. Why cancer cells restrict mitochondrial function, and what the metabolic and phenotypic consequences are if mitochondria in cancer cells are forced to metabolize pyruvate and respire intensively remains unknown. In order to force mitochondria in cancer cells to metabolize pyruvate and respire more intensively we have developed a chemogenetic molecular tool based on Pseudomonas aeruginosa FAD-dependent D-amino acid dehydrogenase DadA that allows bypass of the pyruvate transport block and activation of mitochondrial respiration by generating pyruvate from D-alanine directly in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells and donating electrons downstream of Complex I. DadA-dependent oxidative deamination of D-alanine leads to production of pyruvate and ammonia, involving an unknown electron acceptor for FADH2 (Fig. 1a)8. Since D-alanine is absent in most mammalian tissues, except the brain and pancreas9,10, DadA activity in the cells can be regulated by external administration of D-alanine. The fusion proteins mRuby-DadA and EGFP-DadA, retaining near-native enzymatic activity, were created to enable DadA tracking in live cells (Extended Data Fig. 1a). To control the unspecific effects of heterologous protein expression, an inactive mutant was created by changing the conservative Tyr17 and Tyr18 residues in the predicted FAD-binding domain to Ala residues (Extended Data Fig. 1b, 1a). The fusion proteins were targeted to the mitochondrial matrix, and mitochondrial localization was confirmed by imaging with the mitochondria-specific dyes TMRM or MitoTracker Green (Fig. 1b, Extended Data Fig. 1\u0441, 1d). Mito-mRuby-DadA matrix localization in HeLa Kyoto was confirmed by coexpressing with Micos60-HyPer7 protein localized in the mitochondrial intermembrane space (Fig. 1c). The fluorescence intensity profile along the mitochondrion cross-section showed that the mRuby fluorescence peak was located between two HyPer7 fluorescence peaks, confirming that all observed DadA was localized in the mitochondrial matrix (Fig. 1d). Since the purpose of our study was to reverse the Warburg effect, we named the mitochondrial DadA version fused to the fluorescent protein Grubraw (reversed Warburg). To directly monitor pyruvate dynamics in the cytosol and mitochondrial matrix of HeLa cells expressing Grubraw, we used Pyrates11, a genetically encoded fluorescent sensor for pyruvate. To prove that Grubraw generates pyruvate in the matrix when supplied with the substrate, we removed glucose from the cell culture medium, and inhibited pyruvate entrance to the TCA cycle using the inhibitor of pyruvate dehydrogenase CPI-613. Upon D-Ala addition, we observed a significant increase in matrix pyruvate concentration (Fig. 1e). Grubraw activity did not affect the concentration of pyruvate in the cytosol (Fig. 1f) suggesting that HeLa cells maintain a steady pyruvate concentration in this compartment. We were also interested in whether loading the mitochondrial matrix with pyruvate could enhance electron transport chain (ETC) function. Indeed, Grubraw activity increased mitochondrial transmembrane potential in HeLa cells (Fig. 1g) indicating that the products of Grubraw activity (pyruvate and FADH2) enter mitochondrial oxidative metabolism. D-Ala itself did not affect mitochondrial transmembrane potential. Moreover, Grubraw activity increased oxygen consumption rate in HeLa cells both under fasting conditions (Fig. 1h) and in rich culture medium (Fig. 1i). We concluded that in HeLa cells, even when substrates in the medium are sufficient, the ETC does not function at the maximal physiological rate, likely due to the regulation of mitochondrial transporters and other metabolic \u201cswitching nodes\u201d biased toward aerobic glycolysis. Pyruvate and/or FADH2\nproduced by Grubraw can contribute to ETC function independently of these mechanisms and increase the proportion of OXPHOS in cellular metabolism.\nWhat is more, Grubraw activity increased the intracellular concentrations of some TCA cycle metabolites, namely \u03b1-ketoglutarate and oxaloacetate, as shown by mass-spectrometry (Fig. 1j). Moreover, intracellular concentration of pyruvate also increased. These results suggest that not only was ETC function affected by Grubraw activity, but general matrix metabolism was also enhanced, likely due to the entrance of Grubraw-derived pyruvate into the TCA\ncycle. Thus, the increase in the matrix pyruvate concentration per se is able to enhance the TCA cycle flux. Since we had no direct data about the acceptor of electrons from FADH2 of Grubraw, it was essential to confirm that they are not transferred to O2 thus generating ROS, and that Grubraw activity does not induce oxidative stress in mitochondria. Moreover, the Warburg effect is sometimes thought to be a part of the antioxidant defense system in cancer cells2,12. Given these considerations, we used the ultrasensitive genetically encoded H2O2 probe HyPer7 targeted to the mitochondrial matrix13. No changes in HyPer7-mito signal were detected after D-Ala addition in HeLa cells expressing active and inactive Grubraw (Fig. 1k). Thus, Grubraw does not generate physiologically significant H2O2 concentrations14, nor does acceleration of OXPHOS elevate endogenous mitochondrial H2O2 production. For the DadA homologue from Esherichia coli, electron transfer from FAD to Q10 analogues with various isoprenoid side chain lengths was demonstrated15. Since Grubraw was active in mitochondria and did not generate ROS, and since the purified enzyme was not able to reduce NAD+ or NADP+ in vitro (data not shown), we speculated that it could transfer its electrons to some specific acceptor in the ETC, most probably to Q10. In presence of the complex I inhibitor rotenone and complex II inhibitor malonate, Grubraw activity prevented complete loss of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential and oxygen consumption, in contrast to the inactive control enzyme version (Fig. 1l, 1m). After the addition of complex III inhibitor antimycin A, mitochondrial transmembrane potential and oxygen consumption decreased even in the cells with active Grubraw. This suggested that the electrons from Grubraw entered the ETC downstream of complexes I and II and upstream of complex III, likely via the Q-pool, and thus partially maintained mitochondrial function. Additionally, rotenone and all other small-molecule inhibitors used in this work were proven in vitro to have no effect on Grubraw enzymatic activity (Extended Data Fig. 1e). Moreover, the genetically encoded pH sensor SypHer3s 16 with a matrix localization sequence did not report any significant pH changes when Grubraw was active (Extended Data fig. 1f). Thus, ammonia released during Grubraw functioning did not affect mitochondrial pH. Grubraw activity significantly reduced the growth rate of HeLa cells, but D-Ala itself did not affect proliferation. (Extended Data Fig. 1g). These data suggest that oxidative metabolism intensification, at least at the level induced by Grubraw, significantly alters cellular proliferation. The increase in TCA cycle metabolite pools generated by Grubraw could affect not only the mitochondrial oxidative reactions, but also processes in the cytosol. For example, the increase in oxaloacetate and \u03b1-ketoglutarate pools might enhance the function of the malate-aspartate shuttle, which in turn might change the cytosolic NAD+/NADH ratio. Indeed, the genetically encoded fluorescent sensor SoNar17 demonstrated oxidation of the cytosolic NAD pool during Grubraw activity in HeLa cells (Fig. 2a). The increase in cytosolic NAD+ concentration might increase the rate of glycolysis, since the NAD+ supply is a limiting factor in this pathway, especially in cells of the Warburg metabolic type. However, the Grubraw activity did not change the rate of intracellular glucose metabolization, as shown by the genetically encoded fluorescent sensor for glucose FLII12Pglu-700\u03bc\u0394618 (Fig. 2b). The cytosolic NAD+/NADH ratio is coupled to the balance of lactate and pyruvate production by LDH. Thus, we hypothesized that Grubraw-induced cytosolic NADH depletion results in decreased lactate export. However, no significant changes in extracellular lactate concentration were observed in HeLa cells expressing Grubraw after incubation with\nD-alanine compared to the control cells expressing Grubraw-mut and/or incubated without D-alanine (Fig. 2c). Therefore, we speculated that the change in cytosolic NAD+/NADH ratio is compensated by enhanced pyruvate export, despite not being conventional for Warburg metabolic cells type. Indeed, Grubraw activity increased extracellular pyruvate concentration in HeLa cell culture (Fig. 2d) both in the presence and absence of glucose in the culture medium. It should be noted that, in the presence of glucose, some basal level of pyruvate export existed in all samples. Under fasting conditions, no extracellular pyruvate was detected in the samples before D-alanine addition. These data show that HeLa cells strictly regulate OXPHOS rate and matrix pyruvate concentration, exporting the excessive pyruvate into the extracellular medium.\nWe were next interested in the pathway by which pyruvate exits the mitochondrial matrix (Fig. 2e). MPC transports pyruvate molecules together with protons, so it is unlikely to perform reverse pyruvate transport against the proton concentration gradient. Indeed, incubation of the cells in glucose-free medium with the selective MPC inhibitor UK-5099 (10 \u03bcM) did not prevent enhanced Grubraw-dependent pyruvate export (Fig. 2f). In the control samples, however, pyruvate concentration also was not zero, probably because the residual cytosolic pyruvate could not be transported into mitochondria and was directed to the extracellular medium instead. It is of note that, UK-5099 did not influence the enzymatic activity of Grubraw in vitro (Extended Data Fig. 2b) nor D-alanine transport (Extended Data Fig. 1h). The latter result indicates that D-alanine transport into the mitochondrial matrix does not depend on MPC. We demonstrated that in presence of glucose, the extracellular pyruvate concentration increased in all control samples compared to the samples without UK-5099, probably because of the increased proportion of glycolysis-derived pyruvate in the export flux (Fig. 2f). Therefore, we hypothesized that matrix pyruvate is converted into some intermediates which are transported to the cytosol and turned back into pyruvate there. These might be aspartate, malate, citrate, or alanine (Fig. 2e). To clarify which exact mechanism is used, we knocked down key enzymes involved in the possible export pathways, namely pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH), pyruvate carboxylase (PC), and malic enzyme (ME1), in HeLa Kyoto cells expressing active and inactive versions of Grubraw. The mRNA quantities of PDH1a subunit, PC, and ME1 (cytosolic isoform) were decreased roughly 30-, 4-, and 5-fold, respectively, compared to the control cell line expressing scrambled shRNA (Extended Data Fig. 2a), which resulted in a significant protein quantity decrease, as shown by mass-spectrometry analysis (Extended Data Fig. 2b). Grubraw-dependent pyruvate export was retained in all knockdown cell lines. However, in the cells with PDH1a knockdown the difference was markedly decreased (Fig. 2g). This indicates that pyruvate is oxidized and enters the TCA cycle to be exported from the mitochondrial matrix. Next, we studied the roles of monocarboxylate transporters (MCTs) in Grubraw-induced pyruvate export. MCTs 1, 2, 3, and 4 perform proton-coupled transport of pyruvate, lactate, and some other monocarboxylic acids through the plasma membrane. However, MCT3 is expressed only in some tissues of the eye19, so we focused our attention on MCTs 1, 2, and 4. We obtained HeLa Kyoto cell lines with stable active and inactive Grubraw expression and shRNA-mediated MCT4 knockdown (MCT4 mRNA quantity decreased roughly 9-fold, (Extended Data Fig. 2a and b). On the other hand, we inhibited MCT1 and MCT2 activity using the selective inhibitor AR-C155858 (0.5 \u03bcM). None of these conditions alone affected pyruvate export. However, when MCT4 knockdown and MCT1 and MCT2 inhibition were performed simultaneously, extracellular pyruvate concentrations proportionally decreased in all samples (Fig. 2h). These data suggest that MCT1, MCT2, and MCT4 are all involved in pyruvate export and are interchangeable. To better understand how Grubraw-derived pyruvate enters cell metabolism and shifts metabolic fluxes, we performed 13C metabolic labeling experiments. HeLa cells expressing Grubraw were cultured for 24 hours in a medium with labeled carbon sources (glucose or glutamine). Focusing on acute effects of Grubraw activation, we changed the growth media to HBSS solution containing labeled carbon substrate (with only labeled glucose, or a mixture of glucose and glutamine with only one labeled component), added D-alanine and incubated cells under these conditions for 90 minutes before extraction (Extended Data Fig. 3d). In labeled glucose only medium, we used 1,2-13C-glucose as it can provide information on glycolysis and the pentose-phosphate pathway20\u201322 (Fig. 3a, 3b). Intra- and extracellular\npyruvate in this experiment had almost the same isotopologue distribution (Fig. 3c, Extended Data Fig. 3b) with about half of all pyruvate having two labeled carbons. Activation of Grubraw for 90 min led to a significant decrease in the M+2 isotopologue relative to M+0 in both intraand extracellular pyruvate, intracellular \u03b1-KG and OA, and extracellular lactate (Fig. 3c). This \u201cisotopic dilution\u201d occurs because pyruvate from D-alanine evidently has a natural isotopic distribution, confirming the existence of a carbon flux from the Grubraw-derived mitochondrial pyruvate pool to the pyruvate pool in the extracellular medium. At the same time, the probability of OA M+1 behaves strictly differently (Fig. 3a, 3b). In all control cells, the probability of OA M+1 corresponds to the natural occurrence of the isotope, while the \u201cGrubraw+D-Ala\u201d sample contained elevated OA M+1 isotoplogue. In contrast, the probability of \u03b1-KG M+1 was increased in all labeled samples (Fig. 3d). Only the C1 \u03b1-KG carbon is removed during the [\u03b1-KG \u2192 OA] conversion in the TCA cycle. Thus, isotopologues with an increased content of \u03b1-KG M+1 must carry the tracer atom predominantly in the C1 position in order to turn into an OA pool with a negligibly small amount of tracer. However, fragmentation analysis (Extended Data Fig. 3a, 4) showed that only 10% of \u03b1-KG M+1 isotopologues were labeled at the C1 position. Therefore, we assume that OA is not synthesized from \u03b1-KG in TCA. This may be due to the incomplete TCA turning, which is characteristic of Warburg-type metabolism22. On the other hand, Grubraw-derived additional pyruvate influx can activate full turning of the TCA cycle and/or PC activity (Fig. 3b), resulting in an increase in M+1 OA isotopologue probability. Both activated metabolic pathways lead to OXPHOS intensification that correspond to our SeaHorse experiments (Fig. 1h, 1i).\nprovided in Extended Data Fig. 3a.\nWe also conducted an experiment with two carbon sources, glucose and glutamine, considering these conditions to be closer to physiological conditions. Here we performed parallel labeling - the addition of two substrates, in which the first is labeled, and the second is unlabeled, and vice versa. We called these two states Q*G and G*Q for labeling with glutamine and glucose, respectively. Possible label migration through central metabolism from glutamine is shown on Fig. 4a and 4b, isotopomers distributions are shown on panels c \u2013 e.\nUnder these conditions, glucose supplied lower carbon input into the metabolism relative to glutamine: \u03b1-KGM+2 and OAM+2 relative abundance was about 20% in G*Q samples (Fig. 4c,e) versus roughly 60% in G* only samples (Fig. 3d). The influx of unlabeled carbons from D-Ala was detected by the significant dilution of PyrM+2 in G*Q samples and intracellular \u03b1-KGM+1 in Q*G samples (Fig. 4d and 4c). Interestingly, dilution of \u03b1-KGM+1 by Grubraw activation in Q*G samples is observed in the intracellular pool, but not in the extracellular pool. One possible explanation is shown on Figure 4a and 4b. Glutamine-derived \u03b1-KG may enter the metabolism directly via the TCA cycle and indirectly via reductive carboxylation by IDH1 or IDH2. Glutamine catabolism begins with hydrolysis to glutamate catalyzed by matrix glutaminase. Subsequently, glutamate is deaminated to \u03b1-KG by aminotransferases in the cytosol or mitochondrial matrix (GOTx, GDH, AST). We propose that 5-carbon molecules can be\ntransported from the mitochondrial matrix to the cytosol due to the concentration gradient, after which the glutamine tracer enters the metabolism predominantly via cytosolic IDH (IDH1):\n\u03b1-KG\u2192[IDH1]\u2192 iso-Cit \u2192 Cit \u2192 OA \u2192 Asp \u2192 [to matrix] \u2192 Mal \u2192 [to matrix] (1)\nIn this case, the \u03b1-KG carbon enters the matrix as the C4 metabolite after mixing with glucose-derived C4 metabolite. The cytosolic pool of \u03b1-KG does not mix directly with the mitochondrial pool and appears to be less sensitive to Grubraw-derived carbon influx. This hypothesis is also supported by the strong difference between the occurrence of \u03b1-KGM+1 and OAM+1 in Q*G samples: the abundance of \u03b1-KGM+1 is 200% relative to the M+0 isotopologue whereas for OA it is just 20%. If \u03b1-KGM+1 enters the matrix according to (1) under this condition, then 50% of OA becomes unlabelled. Further, OA is mixed in the matrix with OA obtained from glucose, and the probability of it being labeled drops to 16% (Fig. 4e). In the experiments with the glutamine label, we did not see any tracer atoms in pyruvate. This is not surprising since pyruvate is formed primarily from glucose. The small part that could be derived from \u03b1-KG via pathway (2) is also mostly unlabeled because of the tracer position in glutamine (Fig. 4a, 4b). Finally, this analysis gives an idea about how pyruvate is exported from the matrix. The appearance of additional intramatrix pyruvate increases the OA pool. As a result, the amount of citrate and \u03b1-KG is also increased. Additional citrate is exported more actively and leads to an increased level of OA in the cytosol; this additional OA may be partly converted into pyruvate via nonspecific decarboxylation, PEPCK-dependent decarboxylation, or through malate by cytosolic malic enzyme (ME1). Since ME1 knockdown did not affect the pyruvate export flux induced by Grubraw, the former pathways seem to be more probable. We next tested whether the excessive mitochondrial pyruvate export was an effect characteristic of HeLa Kyoto cells only, or if it was typical for different cancer cell lines of the glycolytic metabolic type. We obtained cancer cell lines HT29 (human colorectal cancer), MDA-MB 231 (human triple-negative breast adenocarcinoma), WM164 and Lu451 (human melanoma), and non-cancer line H9C2 (immortalized rat cardiomyoblasts) stably expressing active and inactive Grubraw (Extended Data Fig. 5a \u2013 d). Under the same experimental conditions as HeLa cells, all cancer cell lines demonstrated Grubraw-dependent pyruvate export (Fig. 5a). On the contrary, in the H9C2 cell line the Grubraw-induced pyruvate export was far less pronounced. In melanoma cell lines, lactate export was proven to be independent of Grubraw activity (Fig. 5b). Moreover, Grubraw activity in melanoma cell lines led to an increase in OCR (Fig. 5c, 5d).\nSummarizing the data presented above, we have identified pyruvate release by cells as a specific mechanism associated with control of the level of pyruvate (or, more generally, control of the carbon flux) in the mitochondrial matrix of cells with Warburg-type metabolism. In oxidative metabolic type cells, like H9C223, this mechanism functions much more weakly. We believe that this is a previously undescribed mechanism that allows cancer cells to control the activity of mitochondria in addition to the commonly accepted restriction of pyruvate intake to the matrix. We next tested whether Grubraw activity affected tumor growth rate in the Lu451 xenograft model in immunodeficient Nude mice. Lu451 cells with stable firefly luciferase and active or mutant Grubraw expression were obtained using CRISPR genome editing (Extended Data Fig. 6a). Luciferase activity and Grubraw-dependent pyruvate export were proven in cell culture (Extended Data Fig. 6b, 6c). An in vitro proliferation test with or without D-Ala revealed a difference in cell division rate between Lu451-Fluc-P2A-Grubraw and the inactive mutant (Fig. 6a).\nThe scheme of the experiment with mice is shown in Fig 6b. Depending on the group, mice with subcutaneously grafted cells received either 0.1M D-Ala in drinking water, or just pure water. In the control group with xenografts expressing mutant Grubraw, D-alanine did not affect tumor growth rate (Extended Data Fig. 6d). In the groups with xenografts expressing active Grubraw, D-Ala decreased tumor growth rate, especially 14 \u2013 28 days after tumor cells injection. By day 28 the mean tumor volume in the group watered with D-Ala was about 2-fold smaller than in the group watered with pure water (Fig. 6c, 6d). Tumor necrotization started 28 days after injection in the water drinking group and after 35 days in the group watered with D-Ala (Fig. 6d). Histological review of tissue sections 48 days after xenograft implantation did not reveal any microscopic changes in the lungs, liver, brain, nor lymph nodes of the experimental animals (Extended Data Fig. 6 e \u2013 h). On day 48, the size of necrosis reached up to 50% of the tumor size in the water group, and up to 30% in the D-alanine group (Extended Data Fig. 6I). After necrosis had started, the luminescence began to decrease in\nall groups, and the dispersion in tumor size inside the groups increased. No toxic effects of 0.1 M D-alanine, including significant weight loss (Extended Data Fig. 5j), were observed in these mice. Our results show that activated mitochondrial metabolism markedly slows down melanoma growth in vivo. In summary, we created a chemogenetic tool named Grubraw capable of activating mitochondrial metabolism in cancer cells. Mitochondrial activation with Grubraw involves the production of pyruvate and FADH2 by enzymatic oxidation of D-Ala in the matrix, increasing oxygen uptake following TCA cycle and ETC activation. Grubraw can be used to activate mitochondria of cells with low mitochondrial pyruvate intake as a result of a genetic mutation or a decrease in expression level, which is characteristic of various cancer cells24\u201326. Apparently, the activity of Grubraw associated with the transfer of electrons from FADH2 to quinones can partially compensate for disturbances in the operation of the electron transport chain associated with mutations or other pathological disorders of complex I. We observed that the mitochondrial pyruvate produced by Grubraw is partially secreted into the extracellular medium by cancer cells, while in cardiomyoblasts with a more pronounced oxidative type of metabolism this effect was very weak. We found that reversing the Warburg effect by activating mitochondrial metabolism leads to a decrease in tumor growth rate. Our data suggest that the Warburg effect, at least in some cancer cell lines, is realized by regulating a limited list of key points in metabolism, such as mitochondrial pyruvate transport. In this case, mitochondrial metabolism is reversibly limited due to the restriction in oxidation substrates rather than totally inhibited due to mutations in housekeeping genes. This mechanism provides metabolic flexibility for cancer cells so that they can effectively survive changes in nutritional conditions, metabolism-targeted therapy, and other challenges. A deep understanding of the mechanisms underlying the metabolic heterogeneity of cancer cells, combined with multiple metabolic nodes targeted for treatment, gives hope for a cure for cancer in the future.\nGrubraw, a chemogenetic generator of mitochondrial pyruvate, reveals new mechanisms of mitochondrial metabolic control that underlay the Warburg effect"

To confirm the mitochondrial localization of DadA, cells expressing active or inactive mRuby-Grubraw and EGFP-Grubraw were stained with MitoTracker Green (ThermoFisher Scientific) or20 nM TMRM, respectively. Mitochondrial membrane potential was also evaluated by TMRM fluorescence. To confirm the matrix localization of DadA, HeLa Kyoto cells coexpressing mRuby-Grubraw and HyPer7-Micos60 were imaged on a Nikon Ti2 confocal microscope with a Nikon A1 LFOV monochrome digital camera. H2O2 generation was evaluated using HyPer7 13 with a mitochondrial matrix localization signal.

For intracellular samples the cultural medium was removed and cells were incubated with 1 ml of DR (1h, -20\u00b0C). For extracellular samples an aliquot of cultural medium was mixed with DR (1:9) and incubated (1h, -20\u00b0C).

For absolute quantitation of extracellular pyruvate and \u03b1-KG, we prepared a series of pure substance dilutions in a fresh cultural medium. MIDs were extracted from MS1 runs and corrected to natural isotope occurrence utilizing MS2 data. Additionally, we extracted the probabilities of tracer inclusion into the first position in a molecule from MS2 data .
