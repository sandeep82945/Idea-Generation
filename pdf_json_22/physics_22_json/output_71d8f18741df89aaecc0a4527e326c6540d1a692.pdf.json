            "text": "The research on upconversion (UC) fluorescent materials has come a long way in terms of their wide applicability areas,1\u20137 and, in the last 61 years, significant contribution has been made by a wide community of researcher working day and night to explore more from the UC phenomena. Among the different applications of UC materials, a major research has been done on white LEDs8\u201311 due to their potentiality to replace traditional light sources because of their following advantages, less hazardous to the environment, low energy consumption,10 and longer lifespan.11 Commonly, UC based white-light are generated in two basic methods (1) combining three independently optimized monochromatic phosphors (red, green and blue) in a proper mixing ratio in the presence of a mercury atmosphere, which was first introduced in 1996 by Downing et al.,12 (2) direct synthesis of a single UC phosphor that converts infrared light into a mixture of RGB. The mercury, present inside the lamp, creates a UV light that excites the phosphor coating inside the walls of the bulb to emit visible light. The former method results into an unstable white-light due to difference in distinct degradation rates of each monochromatic phosphor. Noh et al. shown tridoped phosphors has biomedical and display device applications through upconversion in Y2O3 phosphors.13 The march toward more environmentally friendly lighting involves the development of new phosphors and alternative processes. Recently, research interest has grown to fabricate single white-light phosphors by several lanthanide ion combinations. It has been exploited in sol\u2013gel derived thin films14 to avoid the intrinsic colour balance,1 device complexity15 and high cost associated with such multiple emitting components. The possible reason for the trend to switch into single white-light emitting phosphors can be realised through the fact, that although researcher have tried to modulate the Ln3+ ion concentration in different phosphor host materials and also tried various synthesis techniques, the obtained results are not satisfactory at this stage. As a majority of the synthesized phosphors has relevant limitations16 since blue- and white-light emitters are not as efficient as the green and red ones. Therefore, if we can concentrate in improving the efficiency of blue-emitting phosphors, it may solve the problem. \u2020Electronic supplementary information (ESI) available.

Host materials with low phonon energy may decrease the probability of nonradiative transitions, consequently leading to an increase in the UC efficiency. The UC luminescence (UCL) efficiency depends on the concentration and combination of dopants which define the number of luminescent centres as well as on their spatial distance in the host material lattice. It is reported that the UCL efficiency can be regulated by changing the crystal phase, size and morphology of the host matrix17 and the possible solution lies here. Rare earth (RE) ions in a crystal experience electrostatic interaction and it is dependent on the position of the ion in the crystal and also the structure of the crystal. Same ions in various crystal structures of a compound give different emission intensity, such as Er3+ ions in \u03b2-NaYF4 give very high UC emission compared to the \u03b1-NaYF4. Tailoring the crystal field of lanthanide ions could be an effective strategy for enhancing the UCL of a wide variety of host materials. Despite recent progress in the development of UC material synthesis, the development of UC with enhanced efficiency is still inefficient, especially for blue-emitting materials. In our previous reports18,19 it was observed that the crystal phase transformation in RE-ion doped perovskite phosphor not only changes its structural properties but also shows huge luminescence emission enhancement. Moreover, we have observed that the PL enhancements work as signature codes or spectroscopic probes to detect any crystal phase changes occurring in the sample, as predicted by Polman20 in his findings exactly 21 years ago. Our investigations led us to the conclusion that RE-ion doped perovskite Pb(Zr,Ti)O3(PZT) can be a good multifunctional host for observing crystal-phase-modified luminescence near the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB).18 This material was extensively investigated because of its ultrahigh piezoelectric properties near the phase transition region (MPB), that is, the concurrence of rhombohedral- and tetragonal phases. PZT is the most widely used and investigated multifunctional material which possesses dielectric, piezoelectric, and electro-optic ceramics with diverse applications in industrial manufacturing, power production, transportation, consumer electronics, communication, medicine, and health care. However, in 2003, the European Union imposed a ban on the use of hazardous compounds in consumer items.21 Because lead zirconate titanate ceramics contain 60% harmful PbO, it is recommended to substitute PbO with similar nontoxic materials because of these environment legislations.22 Although serious work has been done on lead substitutes, very few of the reported Pb-free materials can compete with the PZT framework. As a consequence, a number of lead-free perovskite ceramics gathered considerable attention among researchers in recent years because of their eco-friendly behaviour.\nBNT\u2013BT (Bi1/2Na1/2TiO3\u2013BaTiO3), KNN (K1\u2212xNaxNbO3), BCZT [(Ba,Ca)(Zr,Ti)O3] and their co-doped counterparts are not only environment friendly but at the same time they also project good piezoelectric properties such as hard and soft\nPZT.21,22 Among these alternatives, BaTiO3 (BT)-based materials have been investigated because of their high piezoelectric constant d33 of pure BT which is \u223c190 pC N\u22121 with very high permittivity (\u223c104\u2013106). BT can be easily modified by the addition of appropriate dopants at different sites of the ABO3 lattice or by varying the sintering temperatures. 23,24 Recently, large temperature tuning of RE ion-doped BT phosphors by PL and Raman studies was reported by De et al.25 At room temperature, BCZT ceramics, which is a solid solution BT with BaZrO3 or CaTiO3, exhibits interesting phase transition behaviour and piezoelectric properties26 e.g. a phase boundary between rhombohedral (BZT side) and tetragonal (BCT side) phases similar to solid state solutions of PbZrO3 and PbTiO3 to form PZT\n18 at room temperature. Moreover, it also shows MPB boundary27 and is also free from any volatile impurities such as the PZT framework discussed in our previous report.18 In 2016, Wang et al.28 reported strong luminescence and Piezo properties were observed from praseodymium (Pr) replacing BCZT ions at the A-site. Ramovatar et al.29 also reported PL emission and structural property enhancement on Pr-doped BCZT. However, reports on UC luminescence on BCZT correlating with crystal phase studies have not yet reported. Exploring the crystal phase on multifunctional hosts such as BCZT will be of great interest, and there is a need to study optical tailoring properties to observe high UCL efficiency which is expected from BCZT. As our aim was to obtain white-light emission from a combinational phosphor material without the help of several RGB phosphors to avoid degrading loss, we have considered focusing on increasing the blue emission efficiency. Considering the probable high upconversion of the host and the broad range of colours achievable by proper RE dopant selection, attempts to produce white-light from this host are of significant technology interest.\nThe thulium (Tm3+) activator ion gives a strong blue emission at approximately 489 nm, but it is observed only in hosts with a lower phonon frequency. However, like the Er3+ activator ion the Tm3+ ion has a smaller absorption cross-section. Therefore, for efficient blue upconversion, we need Yb3+ ions as sensitisers along with Tm3+ ions, as the ytterbium ion has a large absorption at 980 nm and can efficiently transfer its energy from 2F5/2 level to the Tm\n3+ ion. There are very few reports where crystal-phase-tailored luminescence is observed in RE io-doped PZT, except for our previous reports.18,19 Similarly, crystal phase modified luminescence emission has not been reported for Tm3+/Yb3+ dopant combinations in BCZT hosts. These facts motivate us to study above combination for completing the objective of possible white-light generation using phase tailored blue upconversion.\nIn the present study, we report visible UC emission studies of Tm3+/Yb3+ co-doped BCZT ceramic phosphors, where the substitution of BCZT-A site (Host) is replaced by Yb3+ and Tm3+ ions The replacement of the RE ions in the host follows the rule of substitution, such as charge compatibility and similarity of ionic radii. The blue UC emission efficiency, which was influenced by the crystal phase transformation occurring\n11516 | Dalton Trans., 2022, 51, 11515\u201311525 This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

To generate white-light, the current blue-emitting phosphor is employed with a green/red-emitting phosphor of the same stoichiometry (BCZT:Er3+/Yb3+), which is optimised separately. Two powders, BCZT:Tm3+/Yb3+ (blue emission) and BCZT:Er3+/Yb3+ (green/red emission), were properly mixed using acetone-assisted grinding for 50 min in the second procedure. The biphasic samples generated by powder mixing are referred to as BCZT:Tm3+/Yb3+ + BCZT:Er3+/Yb3+ phosphor and their composition were optimised at a mixed ratio to generate white-light. Intense blue emission by using crystal phase modification was not studied in the past, especially for uniquely designed Tm3+/Yb3+ co-doped BCZT ceramic phosphors. The Tm3+/Yb3+:BCZT ceramic phosphor was synthesized using a novel modified microwave-assisted solid-state reaction. Moreover, the photometric characterization (CIE, CCT, colour purity) of the current biphasic sample in terms of industrial lighting applications is carried out for its use as a commercial cooler white-light source."

The detailed MW assisted multistage synthesis process is shown in the flowchart in Fig. 1. Reagent grade pure raw powders of BaCO3, CaCO3, TiO2, ZrO2 Tm2O3 and Yb2O3 from Sigma Aldrich (Germany) were used for the sample preparation. The RE ion concentrations of Tm3+ and Yb3+ were taken as 0.15 mol% and 2.0 mol%, respectively, to get the optimum luminescence output.30 After being weighted in stoichiometric quantities, the starting materials were mixed with zirconia in isopropanol for 10 h in an agate mortar. The mixed slurry was then kept in a MW reactor oven (2.45 GHz frequency, 700 W power) for 5 h at 300 \u00b0C. This will create separate particles of the material that diffuse to the neighbouring powder particles, which is better than the calcination process. The advantage of MW heating over direct heat treatment is that the temperature profile of an MW material is the inverse of that seen in the\nconventional heat treatment in a furnace, resulting in the surface being cooler than the interior.31 The MW treated slurry was then placed in a furnace for 4 hours at 800 \u00b0C. The heattreated batch was then wet mixed using a pure ethanol medium and again MW treated for another 2 h at 300 \u00b0C. After the second MW treatment, the dried slurry was sintered at four different temperatures to obtain powdered samples. Part of the mixed batch was mixed with a Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) binding agent and subsequently pressed into a pellet form. In the final stage, the pellets were sintered at four different temperatures from a 1000 to 1300 \u00b0C for 10 h after the second MW treatment, and the samples were ready for measurements.\nThe synthesis technique of the green/red-emitting phosphor Er3+/Yb3+:BCZT can be found in the ESI.\u2020"

The crystalline nature of the Tm3+/Yb3+:BCZT ceramic phosphors was analysed by recording the powder XRD patterns for different sintering temperatures. The diffraction patterns recorded for the samples sintered at 1000\u20131200 \u00b0C shows tetragonal crystal symmetry (P4mm) according to ICDD card no. 05-0626 of BaTiO3.\n23 However, the sample sintered at 1300 \u00b0C shows different crystal symmetry likely to be Rhombohedral (R3m), which is confirmed by the ICDD card no. 85-0368 of BaTiO3.

The occurrence of the two different crystal symmetries is also supported by Rietveld analysis.\nThe Rietveld refinement was implemented using the FullProf Suite program (Free version) for improved structural information. The diffraction peak experiences into (002)T and (200)T, indicating the presence of a tetragonal (T) phase (ICDD # 05-0626) with a space group of P4mm for the samples sintered at 1000\u20131200 \u00b0C. For sintering temperature 1300 \u00b0C, (002)T and (200)T these two peaks merges into a single one to indicate a rhombohedral symmetry. Moreover, in the rhombohedral symmetry the peak near 2\u03b8 = 66\u00b0 splits into two (220) and (202) respectively. The structural phase transition from tetragonal to rhombohedral is also confirmed by Rietveld refinements as shown in Fig. 3.\nRietveld refinement was performed using (Ba, Ca) (Zr, Ti)O3 structure as a standard model, and the results of the refinements are shown in Table 1. The Rietveld refinement results for the samples sintered at 1000\u20131200 \u00b0C are shown in the ESI (see Fig. ESI 1).\u2020 The intermediate phases were also considered in the refinement process. The shifting of the diffraction peaks (002/200) towards lower 2\u03b8 values may be attributed to the larger ionic radius of Tm3+ (0.88 \u00c5) compared to that of Ti4+ (0.68 \u00c5), and Zr4+ (0.72 \u00c5). The positions of the dopant ions (Tm3+/Yb3+) could not be determined directly through the refinement. The probable locations in the crystal structure can still be inferred. The most likely case is that the Tm3+ ions replaced the Ba2+ and another charge was compensated by the Ti4+ ion at the B-site. The reduced \u03c72 value of the refined data was found to be 1.4548 for the sample sintered at 1300 \u00b0C and it confirms that a rhombohedral crystal symmetry has formed in the sample. The crystal phase transformation (tetragonal to rhombohedral) occurring in the sample increased the dopant ion transiting capabilities. A phase change from lower crystal symmetry to higher crystal symmetry is expected to help RE ion-dopants to give much better optical emission property. For our reference we have also recorded the XRD pattern for samples sintered at 1150 \u00b0C and 1250 \u00b0C to see any intermediate phase change or any change in diffraction peaks. The related plots are shown in Fig. (ESI 2).\u2020 The result shows no change in the diffraction peaks which confirms that the phase change occurs exactly at the 1300 \u00b0C sintering temperature.\nThe FESEM images of the Tm3+/Yb3+:BCZT samples sintered at four different temperatures are shown in ESI 3.\u2020 All\nFig. 2 (a) Powder X-ray diffraction pattern of Tm3+/Yb3+ doped BCZT ceramic sample sintered at 1300 \u00b0C.

The electronic transition spectra in the diffuse reflectance (DRS) mode were recorded to obtain exact excitations for the present sample and a plot of the UV-Vis spectrum is shown in the ESI 4.\u2020 As the 976 nm bands were strongly absorbed by the sample, we could possibly excite the sample with a 980 nm diode laser. The upconversion emission spectra of Tm3+/Yb3+ co-doped BCZT ceramic phosphors under 980 nm NIR excitation were recorded for four samples, and blue emission was observed. The most intense emission band was observed at 479 nm, which was associated with the 1G4 \u2192\n3H6 transition of the Tm3+ ions (visible spectral range). Other less intense, emission bands were observed at approximately 658 and 800 nm, and corresponding to the 1G4 \u2192 3F4 and 3H4 \u2192\n3H6 transitions of Tm3+, respectively. The recorded spectra are compared in Fig. 4. It is noticeable that the intensity of the emission band in the 450\u2013500 nm region (transition 1G4 \u2192\n3H6) is very high compared to the 800 nm emission corresponding to 3H4 \u2192 3H6 transition. In general, the most intense UC emission is observed at approximately 800 nm for the Tm3+ ion under 980 nm excitation. However, in the present case the observed results show an increment of the visible blue emission which is rare and advantageous. The intensities of all emission bands remained low for samples sintered at 1000 \u00b0C, 1100 \u00b0C and 1200 \u00b0C, according to a comparison of the UC emission\nspectra. However, the change observed in the UC emission intensity of the sample sintered at 1300 \u00b0C is very interesting. Almost 60 times enhancement in intensity was observed compared with the other samples. This change in emission intensity is very high when we compare the results with those of the Er3+/Yb3+ codoped BCZT sample (see ESI 5\u2020). As per our previous observations in RE doped perovskite oxide photoluminescence studies,18,19,30 we can correlate these present enhancement with crystal phase dependent UC studies. The crystal phase transformation (from tetragonal to rhombohedral symmetry) occuring in the sample was confirmed by X-ray diffraction analysis. It is well known that emission intensity is greatly impacted by domain and grain boundaries due to light scattering; hence UC emission intensity can identify phase transition. However, it is worth mentioning, the accuracy factor depends on emission band shifting rather than direct emission intensity, as intensity has no direct relationship with decoding crystal structure information. Here the observed UC emission has two relational analogies by which we can claim the occurrence of phase transformation in the sample. One is the 479 nm blue emission band dominating the 800 nm NIR emission band (very rare); the other reason is almost 60 times the intensity hike. If only the crystallite size has increased with a higher sintering temperature, then there will be a gradual increase in the emission efficiency. The unexpected large emission intensity leap is due to the symmetry transformation that is rhombohedral to tetragonal phase when the sintering temperature increases from 1200 \u00b0C to 1300 \u00b0C. This symmetry transformation helped us to reach the overall goal of efficient blue UC emission which can be used as a base material for W-LEDs.\n3.2.2 Excitation power dependence study. To further study the excitation and emission processes, the involvement of the number of NIR photons for each emission band was studied. The UC emission intensity was recorded at different excitation powers (980 nm excitation). The graphs were plotted according to the procedure described in our previous reports.32 The pump power dependence of the emission bands at 478, 658, 698, and 800 nm when the sample was excited by a 980 nm diode laser, is shown at Fig. 5. The graph clearly shows that the emission band at 479 nm varies smoothly with input power (shown in the inset). The double logarithmic plot of the UC emission intensity versus the excitation power density is also shown in the inset. The linear fitted slopes (n) were n479 = 1.39, n658 = 1.01 and n800 = 1.15. It was expected that the slope values for these emission bands should be around 2.0, but the experimental values were found to be less than 2. A possible reason for these proper values of \u2018n\u2019 can be understood by the fact that some phonon-assisted transitions also occur. The thermal quenching phenomena can also be considered and can be calculated for the exact integer number of photons, using the method demonstrated in our previous report.33 The emission band at 478 nm has the highest slope value; hence, non-radiative transitions contribute the least. The slope values for the other bands were quite low, indicating the involvement of non-radiative channels.\nThis journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022 Dalton Trans., 2022, 51, 11515\u201311525 | 11519\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Thulium-activated phosphors have complex energy-level structures. The reason for this kind of complicated energy level structure can be predicted as the strong deviation from R\u2013S coupling in the 4f configuration; as a result the photon crosses through many paths and, ultimately, the relaxation of the excited levels of Tm3+ ions give rise to a wide variety of emission bands in the UV, visible, and IR regions. The UC mechanisms based on the Tm3+/Yb3+ ion energy level diagram are shown in Fig. 6 and possible pathways are also discussed. The UC mechanism in Tm3+/Yb3+ ions can be understood based on power-dependence studies. Detailed processes have already been discussed in our previous reports30 and important steps are given here. The 980 nm excitation is very weakly absorbed by the Tm3+ ion, and hence singly doped Tm3+ ions give very weak UC emission. However, when the Yb3+ ions are co-doped, intense blue emission is observed from the Tm3+ ion, which can be explained based on cooperative energy transfer. In this case Yb3+ ions are excited to the 2F5/2 level by absorbing 980 nm radiation. The two Yb 3+\nions cooperatively join their energies and reach a virtual level of approximately 489 nm.\n980 nm \u00bc 10 204 cm 1\n10 204 cm 1 \u00fe 10 204 cm 1 \u00bc 20 408 cm 1 \u00bc 490 nm\nThe energy from this virtual level was radiatively transferred to the 1G4 level of the Tm\n3+ ion. The 1G4 level relaxes further to lower levels and populates them. Also, at a small probability the process 2F5/2 (Yb 3+) + 3H6 (Tm 3+) \u2192 2F7/2 (Yb\n3+) + 3H5 (Tm3+) also happens. The 3H5 level quickly depopulates via multi-phonon relaxation to the lower lying 3F4 level. The\n3F4 level absorbs 980 nm excitation and populates the 3F2 level. The radiative emission wavelengths and associated transitions are shown in Fig. 6.\n3.2.4 Crystal phase transformed UC emission strategy. UC luminescence depends on the concentration and combination of dopants which define the number of luminescent centres as well as their spatial distance in the host material lattice. It has been reported that UC emission efficiency can be regulated by changing the crystal phase, size, and morphology of the host matrix and hope lies here. Rare-earth ions in a crystal experience electrostatic interactions and their magnitudes are dependent on the position of the ion in the structure of the crystal. Same ion in various crystal structures of a compound gives different emission intensity e.g. Er3+ ion in \u03b2-NaYF4 gives very high UC emission compared to \u03b1-NaYF4.34,35 Here, the blue UC emission efficiency was tailored using this crystal phase modulation. The four samples were synthesised at four different sintering temperatures (1000\u20131300 \u00b0C) to investigate the crystal phase modulation activated by thermal heating near the MPB. The first three samples sintered at 1000\u20131200 \u00b0C respectively shows tetragonal symmetry (P4mm), whereas the sample sintered at 1300 \u00b0C exhibited rhombohedral symmetry (R3m). Interestingly the powder XRD patterns show that the sample at 1300 \u00b0C contains some additional peaks which match with the tetragonal symmetry. Therefore, we have tried to scan again for the sample sintered at 1300 \u00b0C and found the most intense diffraction peak (2 0 0) could be fitted in a Gaussian distribution into two peaks. Moreover the two fitted peaks has exact matching with 2\u03b8 values 44.5\u00b0 of (0 0 2)R symmetry and 2\u03b8 = 44.9\u00b0 of (2 0 0)R symmetry. The shape of crystal structure and atomic arrangement changed continuously during the heating process, especially the thermal activation energy is responsible for the change of crystal symmetry in this perovskite oxide ceramics near MPB region. The tetragonal phase of Tm3+/Yb3+:BCZT was activated by thermal activation energy and somewhat turned into higher rhombohedral crystal symmetry. An interesting observation was made during the powder XRD scan of the sample sintered at 1300 \u00b0C. Not only did the tetragonal symmetry gradually decrease along the increasing sintering temperature, at 1300 \u00b0C it coexisted with a new rhombohedral symmetry. It is well known that, near the morphotropic phase boundary, the existence of two phases is very unstable and usually lasts for a very short time. However,\nFig. 5 Excitation power dependence UC emission spectra of the emission bands of Tm3+/Yb3+:BCZT ceramics.

The atomic evolution during the phase transformation process from the tetragonal to metastable rhombohedral phase is supported by the idea that the activation energy of tetragonal symmetry is conserved and transferred to the next stable phase near the MPB. In the nano regime, a similar observation was made by Pin et al.35 who demonstrated the transformation of Er3+/Yb3+ doped UCNPs from the hexagonal phase to the stable cubic phase at the interface of the liquid similar to another unstable phase. In the present case, this was the sole reason for the excellent enhancement in luminescence observed for the sample at 1300 \u00b0C (almost \u223c60 times). Usually, the blue UC emission efficiency is one order of magnitude lower than the green/orange emission efficiency. However, the present ceramic phosphor sample utilised the replacement of optically active dopants, that is, Tm3+/Yb3+ at the interface of two coexisting phases. Therefore, it is expected that the quantum efficiency of the blue-emission will be much higher than that reported previously. To the best of our knowledge, this type of structural phase modulation through atomic evolution has never been reported to correlate with any optical emissive properties, especially in UC emission studies.\n3.2.5 UC quantum efficiency. The UC emission efficiency of the present sample was observed to further process its optical emissive properties for white-light applications. The UC luminescence quantum yield (\u03a6UC) is defined by eqn (1):\n\u03a6UC \u00bc qp:emissionqp:absorbed \u00f01\u00de\nHere, qp.emission is the upconverted emission photon flux (in photons per sec) and qp.absorbed is the photon flux absorbed by the sensitizer species (in photons per sec):\n\u03a6UC \u00bc \u00d0 \u03bb2 \u03bb1\nIuc\u00f0\u03bb\u00ded\u03bb qp:absorbed\n\u00f02\u00de\nHere, Iuc(\u03bb) is the emission intensity (in photons per sec per nm), and \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 represents the boundary wavelengths of the complete upconverted emission spectrum, or the 4f\u20134f transition of interest, respectively. qp.absorbed is calculated by integrating over the excitation wavelength range \u03bb3 to \u03bb4, and subtracting the intensity of the excitation source that has passed through the sample (Iexc-sample, in photons per s per nm) from the intensity of the excitation source that has passed through a blank sample (work as reference sample) (Iexc-blank). A dispersion of undoped BCZT sample of identical size distributed in the same solvent as the sample with the similar concentration was used as blank sample. Absence of optically active dopant makes it suitable for reference sample which doesn\u2019t absorb the excitation wavelength.\nqp:absorbed \u00bc \u00f0\u03bb4 \u03bb3 \u00bdIexc\u2010blank\u00f0\u03bb\u00de Iexc\u2010sample\u00f0\u03bb\u00de d\u03bb \u00f03\u00de\nThe eqn (2) can be expressed as,\n\u03a6UC \u00bc \u00d0 \u03bb2 \u03bb1 Iuc\u00f0\u03bb\u00ded\u03bb\u00d0 \u03bb4\n\u03bb3 \u00bdIexc\u2010blank\u00f0\u03bb\u00de Iexc\u2010sample\u00f0\u03bb\u00de d\u03bb\n\u00f04\u00de\nThe spectrometer and the integrating sphere were calibrated such that the measured intensities are directly proportional to the photon flux, i.e. (\u03bb) \u221d [mol of photons per s per nm]. As a result, integrating these values over the boundary wavelength range will directly count the flux of photons. Because the intensity of the upconverted light is lower than that of the stimulating laser source, the sample absorption and emission cannot be detected simultaneously, as the laser light saturates the spectrometer, preventing simultaneous measurement of UC. To overcome this, the absorption was measured using a neutral density (ND) filter with a specified transmittance (\u223c99.85% attenuation). To measure the absorbed photon flux, this filter was added between the integrating sphere and the spectrometer. To remove the excitation light before measuring the upconverted emission, this filter was replaced with an OD4 short pass filter (875 nm). Over the wavelength range of the laser (950\u2013990 nm), the attenuation factor Fattn was averaged. The short pass filter used to detect the intensity of the upconverted emission was also employed to account for the light\u2019s minimal absorption. The UC luminescence intensity was divided by the short pass filter\u2019s transmission curve T (\u03bb) in the wavelength range of the upconverted light. Due to the short pass filter\u2019s significant absorption of light with a wavelength shorter than 430 nm, this approach was unable to detect any UV emission. The accordingly corrected equation for \u03a6UC is eqn (5):\n\u03a6UC\u00bc\n\u00f0\u03bb2 \u03bb1\nIuc\u00f0\u03bb\u00de T\u00f0\u03bb\u00de d\u03bb\u00f0\u03bb4\n\u03bb3\n\u00bdIexc\u2010blank\u00f0\u03bb\u00de Iexc\u2010sample\u00f0\u03bb\u00de Fattn:\nd\u03bb \u00bc qp:emission qp:absorbed \u00f05\u00de\nFig. 7 shows the quantum yield for different samples measured based on eqn (1\u20135) using the above discussed setup. The quantum yield shown by the 479 nm blue UC emission was found to be the highest.\nThis journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022 Dalton Trans., 2022, 51, 11515\u201311525 | 11521\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Quantum yields for a wide range of power dependencies were observed and plotted using the logarithmic relation shown in Fig. 8(a). The blue-emission band of Tm3+/Yb3+:BCZT exhibited the highest quantum yield over a wide range of pump power densities. These results also support the idea of crystal-phase-modified UC emission enhancement. To better understand the degradation and stability the quantum yield of the phosphors, we also investigated the QY in the Tm3+/Yb3+: BCZT thin films, as shown in Fig. 8(b). It is observed that the deposited phosphor thin film also shows the high yield values in the order of 1 \u00d7 10\u22123. The results predicted that the current phosphor material could also be individually used as a commercial blue-emitting phosphor in device fabrication with higher emissivity. The deposition technique of the Tm3+/Yb3+: BCZT thin film on a Si- substrate is described in the ESI.\u2020\n3.2.6 White-light emission process. The generation of white-light using UC emission requires a combinational phosphor mixed in specific ratio, which is our technological interest. The high quantum efficiencies of the major emission band at 479 nm of Tm3+/Yb3+:BCZT ceramics show the great potential of its use in white-light generation if mixed with a green/red-emitting phosphor. The same stoichiometric composition was used to synthesise other Er3+/Yb3+:BCZT ceramics with optimised dopant concentrations reported in our earlier work19,30 to produce green/red-emitting phosphors. The detailed synthesis process is discussed in the ESI.\u2020\nThe UC emission studies of the Er3+/Yb3+:BCZT ceramic were performed using 980 nm CW laser irradiation. The ambient condition emission spectra of Er3+/Yb3+:BCZT ceramic samples sintered at 1300 \u00b0C are shown in figure (ESI 5\u2020). Two intense green emission bands at 524 and 543 nm, assigned to the popular 2H11/2 \u2192 4I15/2 and 4S3/2 \u2192\n4I15/2 transitions of trivalent erbium, respectively, were observed in the sample.\nThe UC emission spectra of the white-emitting biphasic sample under 980 nm excitations are presented in Fig. 9. In the visible range, three primary emission bands centred at 479, 550, and 673 nm were observed. Based on the RGB emissions, it was plausible to obtain multicolour emissions, includ-\ning white-light by appropriately adjusting the dopant concentrations. All the samples had high emissions in the near-infrared range, centred at 800 nm. The compositions, x and y calculated colour coordinates, excitation power densities, and roomtemperature UC efficiencies of the selected biphasic sample under 980 nm stimulation are listed in Table 2.\nAt low excitation power densities (as low as 35 W cm\u22122), biphasic materials generate white-light. Variations in the excitation power density had a little effect on the colour coordinates for a given sample composition (Table 2). The calculated chromaticity coordinates (x, y) are (0.331, 0.344), which are very close to the standard equal energy white-light co-ordinates (0.333, 0.333) according to the 1931 CIE diagram, (Fig. 11). Fig. 10 shows the images of the samples taken from a canon mirror-less camera with a longer exposure time of 5\u2033, ISO 200 aperture f6.3 and exposure +21/2, when the samples irradiated with a 980 nm diode laser at the referred power densities. From the images, it was found that the biphasic sample (S_2) showed the maximum efficiency and intense white-light. The images were captured using an NIR filter and a neutral density (ND) filter which blocked the NIR emission from the samples. Images without the NIR filter appears to be reddish and can be seen in the ESI 6.\u2020 In addition, ESI 6\u2020 contains the (a) biphasic sample emission image with longer NIR exposure (laser induced heating) (b) emission image from the sample without NIR filter, (c) top view of the sample holder, (d) horizontal view of the sample holder in normal light (e) full 980 laser setup for recording the white emission.\nThe present biphasic material showed higher UC efficiencies of \u223c0.30% at power densities as low as 35 W cm\u22122 (Table 2) and \u223c0.40% at 40 W cm\u22122. Conventionally, it has been found that blue-emitting phosphors are an order of magnitude lower than green- or orange-emitting phosphor. However, the present blue-emitting phosphor (Tm3+/Yb3+: BCZT) showed exceptional quantum efficiency at different power densities (Fig. 8), which was due to the crystal phase transformation occurring in the sample discussed above. Taking advantage of the crystal symmetry change occurring in\n11522 | Dalton Trans., 2022, 51, 11515\u201311525 This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

Table 1 shows that to achieve white-light in biphasic materials, only 10 times more blue-emitting phosphors are required than green-emitting phosphors. Here, special emphasis is given to increase the efficiency of the blue-emitting phosphors via the crystal phase transformation occurring in the sample, which resulted in a significant increase in the overall white-light generation efficiency.\nIn three essential ways, we feel our samples are the bestreported white upconverting materials. First, as compared to materials for which UC efficiencies have been published; they exhibit greater blue UC emission efficiencies (Table 3). More importantly, the conventional blue-emission efficiency is significantly increased by using the crystal phase transformation from tetragonal to rhombohedral symmetry. This type of optical strategy has never been used to achieve white-light emissions. They also achieved high efficiencies when using lower excitation power densities than previously reported perovskite phosphor materials. It is worth noting that the power density for UC white-light generation and their efficiencies were not provided in many of the reports. For the reasons discussed above, the current biphasic ceramic phosphor (Tm3+/ Yb3+:BCZT + Er3+/Yb3+:BCZT) is a promising candidates for a various applications, including display backlighting and WLED manufacturing.\n3.2.7 Photometric characterizations. The present biphasic sample showed some interesting results for white-light emission. The optimal white chromaticity, according to the National Television Standard Committee (NTSC) standard, is around (0.33, 0.33). During the test, strong white-light emission was observed with the naked eye (Fig. 10). The quality of the whitelight was assessed using the correlated colour temperature (CCT) for the application in commercial phosphor (w-LEDs). Using McCamy\u2019s empirical approach, the CCT value of the current phosphor was found within 5000\u20136000 K for the entire mixed ratio mentioned in the Table 1. The detailed formula and procedures were based on our previous work.33 According to lighting industry convention, lamps with low CCT values (2700 K to 3000 K) provide light that appears \u201cwarm\u201d, while lamps having high CCT values (4000 K to 6500 K) provide light that appears \u201ccool\u201d. Here the present biphasic phosphors show higher CCT and higher colour rendering index (CRI) near 90.56 which represents the potential for achieving cooler white-light appropriate for high quality lighting environments.\nWe further checked the colour purity of the biphasic samples from S_1 to S_7 to support \u201ccolour consistency\u201d factor, a term used by the lighting industry utilizes a colour tolerance system in conjunction with CCT. Fig. 12 shows the colour purity calculation diagram of the different biphasic samples on the locus of the blackbody curve in the CIE diagram.

            "text": "In pursuit of efficient upconverted white-light emission from RE ion-doped phosphors, two individual phosphors that are Tm3+/Yb3+:BCZT + Er3+/Yb3+:BCZT were mixed in a specific ratio (Table 2) and excited with a 980 nm CW diode laser. Tm3+/Yb3+ co-doped BCZT ceramic phosphors were synthesised using a novel microwave assisted multistage solid state reaction route. The synthesis route and sintering temperatures were specially designed to observe the crystal phase change in the Tm3+/Yb3+:BCZT near the MPB. The quantum efficiency of 479 nm blue emissions was found to be exceptionally good on the verge of the crystal phase transformation occurring in the sample. Moreover, the quantum efficiencies of the blue phosphor were high in a wide range of excitation\npower densities (from moderate to high), implying that the stability of the blue emission was also high. A strategy to enhance the blue UC emission efficiency through crystal phase modulation was achieved, and biphasic phosphor samples were characterised by the addition of an Er3+/Yb3+:BCZT phosphor, which was optimized separately. White-light was generated in all samples mixed at different ratios (Table 2). It was found that only 10 times bluer phosphor than green phosphor is required to produce ideal chromatic white-light emission. Moreover, the current biphasic phosphor shows higher UC efficiencies of \u223c0.30% at power densities as low as 35 W cm\u22122 and \u223c0.40% at 40 W cm\u22122 (white-light emission through frequency UC), which is the best result ever reported to our knowledge. The main advantage of generating white-light through the referred process is that two different phosphors are optimized separately with threshold efficiency values; only their mixing ratio will determine the ultimate desirable results. The present samples emitted white-light at moderate low power with almost ideal white chromaticity with analogous to the NTSC standards. The blue emission (479 nm) intensity significantly increased in comparison to NIR (808 nm) wavelengths almost (x 60 times) upon sintering temperature change in Tm3+/Yb3+:BCZT and the anomalous behaviour is explained using the crystal phase transformation occurring in the sample. This improved UC strategy can be used to enhance white-light applications through structural modulation. Photometric characterisations show that the emitted white-light can be used as a cooler white-light source because of its observed higher CCT value (\u223c5500 K) with a higher CRI value (90.56). The present biphasic phosphor has lab scale success in generating highly efficient (0.40%) upconverted white-light with a colour purity of \u223c92%; it is also expected that the present phosphor will be fruitful at the industrial scale.\nAuthor contributions\nThe original idea, design, conceptualization of the work, experiments, Data analysis and interpretation and drafting of the article were done by PPS.
