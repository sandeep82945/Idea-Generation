1. **Developing methods for extracting structured data from scientific figures and tables.** This could involve using computer vision and natural language processing techniques to identify and extract key information from these non-textual components of scientific documents.


2. **Exploring the use of the literature graph for scientific discovery.** This could involve developing algorithms for identifying patterns and relationships in the graph that can be used to generate new hypotheses or insights.


3. **Investigating the use of the literature graph for improving scientific search and recommendation systems.** This could involve developing algorithms for ranking and recommending papers to users based on their interests and research needs.


4. **Exploring the use of the literature graph for tracking and predicting scientific trends.** This could involve developing algorithms for identifying emerging topics and trends in the scientific literature, as well as predicting the future impact of papers and authors.


5. **Investigating the use of the literature graph for supporting scientific collaboration.** This could involve developing tools and algorithms for helping researchers find collaborators with similar interests and expertise, as well as for facilitating the exchange of ideas and information between researchers.
