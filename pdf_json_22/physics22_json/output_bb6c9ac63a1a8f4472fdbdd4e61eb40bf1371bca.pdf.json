We found that TMAO counterbalanced the disruptive effect of pressure destabilization on account of an earlier reported electronic polarization effect that led to an increased TMAO dipole moment under compression of the solvent. This direct stabilization mechanism became ineffective when the dipole polarization of TMAO was not considered and was linked to nonspecific van der Waals interactions of TMAO with the nonpolar surfaces of the two helices, which became weaker as TMAO became stronger polarized at high pressure. The corresponding thermodynamic driving forces are discussed and should be generic for hydrophobic interactions under high pressure. The proposed mechanism suggests that TMAO stands out as a piezolyte among stabilizing osmolytes, potentially protecting biological assemblies formed by hydrophobic interactions under extreme pressure conditions. \u00a9 2022 Author(s).

High pressure forces proteins to unfold and thereby disrupts vital functions, such as enzymatic reactions and sub-cellular transport. It also destabilizes functional biocondensates, which are formed by liquid\u2013liquid phase separation (LLPS), a process important for membrane-less compartmentalization in the cell. The question is how are these organisms, called piezophiles because they have adapted to high pressure, able to counteract the high pressure conditions. The adaptation can either occur through attuned piezophilic proteins or through the presence of small organic cosolutes referred to as osmolytes. It has been found that deep sea creatures have a high concentration of certain osmolytes, such as methylamines, in their cells that alongside of pressure increases linearly with depth.14 Based on this observation, these osmolytes, in particular trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), are thought to be specialized in their counteractions of pressure denaturation and have therefore been termed \u201cpiezolytes.\u201d TMAO has been found to increase the pressure stability of proteins and stabilize biomolecular condensates formed by LLPS under high pressure conditions, but until now there are no indications that piezolytes are distinct from other osmolytes. In this regard, especially their effect on hydrophobic parts of proteins is of interest, since the hydrophobic interactions are important in LLPS, e.g., the elastine-like peptide (ELP), which exhibits pressureand osmolytedependent LLPS, is made up of nearly 80% hydrophobic amino acids.12 The effect of pressure on any chemical equilibrium is determined by the volume difference between reactants and products according to the Le-Chatelier\u2019s principle. For example, in protein folding, the unfolded state has a smaller partial molar volume than the folded state, resulting in protein denaturation upon increasing pressure.4 On the other hand, the effect of cosolutes on a chemical equilibrium (e.g., protein folding or protein association in solution) is determined by the preferential binding of the cosolutes to the reactants and products. Correspondingly, the dependence of the Gibbs energy, \u0394G2(p, c3), of folding a protein on pressure, J. Chem. Phys. 157, 201101 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0112485 157, 201101-1 \u00a9 Author(s) 2022 18 Jauary 2024 2129:51 The Journal of Chemical Physics COMMUNICATION scitation.org/journal/jcp p, and cosolute concentration, c3, at a fixed temperature, T, can be written as d\u0394G2(p, c3) = \u0394V2dp \u2212 RT\u0394\u039323 a33 c3 dc3, (1) where we used the standard convention and refer to water as component 1, protein as component 2, and the cosolute as component 3. In Eq. (1), \u0394G2 is the difference in Gibbs energy of the folded (F) and unfolded (U) states of the protein, \u0394V2 = V F 2 \u2212 V U 2 the difference in partial molar volumes upon folding, \u0394\u039323 = \u0393 F 23 \u2212 \u0393 U 23 the difference in cosolute preferential binding coefficient upon folding,17 R is the gas constant, and a33 = [1 + c3(G33 \u2212G31)] an activity enhancement factor (>1 for strong water-binding osmolytes), in which G33 and G31 are the Kirkwood\u2013Buff integrals related to the components water and cosolute of the bulk solvent. One hypothesis regarding how piezophiles have adapted to high pressure is based on the first part of the above expression: proteins from piezophiles have a smaller volume change upon unfolding, or the volume change upon unfolding is reduced due to the addition of piezolytes. However, the adaption of proteins has been disproven by Avagyan et al., who studied several proteins of piezophiles and non-piezophiles.19 Papini et al. measured the effects of protecting osmolytes and denaturants on \u0394V2 of bovine ribonuclease and egg white lysozyme with differential scanning calorimetry and pressure perturbation calorimetry.20 However, these authors found that there was nothing special about osmolytes that have been termed piezolytes, as all protecting osmolytes considered in their work had no direct effect on \u0394V2 and the pressure denaturation of proteins. They therefore dismissed the term \u201cpiezolyte.\u201d We note that, because \u0394V2 is independent of c3, Eq. (1) implies that RT\u0394\u039323a33/c3 does not depend on pressure. Although TMAO cannot be distinguished as a piezolyte in the pressure stabilization of proteins, its hydration properties are pressure-dependent and, by contrast to other cosolutes, such as urea,21 determined by changes in electronic polarization at high pressure. TMAO has a large dipole moment, which increases by nearly a factor of two when transferred from the gas phase to water.23 Due to its zwitterionic nature, it is able to tightly bind water molecules with its negatively charged oxygen.24 This property leads to the depletion of TMAO from many protein surfaces, with a corresponding increase in their thermal stability25 and an indirect effect on pressure stabilization.20 At ambient pressure, TMAO binds around three water molecules. At high hydrostatic pressure, the compression of the solvent, however, leads to electronic polarization effects that further enhance the dipole moment of TMAO.23 Interestingly, at 10 kbar, it has been found that TMAO increases its water binding to a partial fourfold coordination of the oxygen atom.16 Although this change in TMAO\u2013water interaction has an insignificant direct effect on the pressure stability of proteins,20 it potentially affects hydrophobic interactions26 and may therefore play a role in biomolecular LLPS and the pressure stability of functional biomolecular condensates, which are more susceptible to pressure than the folding of proteins. To explore this question, we herein report a computer simulation study combined with free-energy calculations that quantify the effect of pressure-induced changes in TMAO polarization on the hydrophobic interaction of two nonpolar polyalanine-\u03b1-helices. All electrostatic interactions involving the polypeptide were removed from the model by setting the partial atomic charges on the solutes equal to zero. We therefore consider model hydrophobic solutes, not real biomolecules. This model system was chosen in order to isolate the potential role of piezolytic effects on hydrophobic interactions between solutes with extended nonpolar surfaces. The calculations reported below revealed that TMAO counterbalanced the pressure destabilization of hydrophobic interactions due to its enhanced dipole polarization at high pressure. We found that this pressurestabilizing effect disappeared when ignoring the polarization of the TMAO dipole and found indications that this newly discovered effect was controlled by thermodynamic driving forces that should be generic for hydrophobic interactions in TMAO/water solutions under extreme pressure conditions. We used the nonpolarizable, pressure-dependent TMAO force field (FF) of H\u00f6lzl et al.,23 which, among other properties, reproduces the density of TMAO\u2013water solutions at ambient and high pressures. This force field assigns adjustable partial charges to TMAO, which models the increased dipole polarization at high pressure. To explore the implications of this polarization effect on the hydrophobic interaction of the two nonpolar \u03b1-helices under high-pressure conditions (2 kbar), we performed umbrella sampling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations using two different approaches: (1) MD simulations were performed that used the polarized TMAO model with an increased dipole moment, from hereon called high-dipole FF, (2) MD simulations were performed that used the non-polarized TMAO model, parameterized for ambient pressure conditions, from hereon called low-dipole FF. We further calculated the difference in the partial molar volumes in the associated and dissociated states of the two \u03b1-helices and the preferential binding coefficient, \u039323, of the single helix with these two approaches. The technical details on the force fields and umbrella sampling simulations are provided in the supplementary material. Ambient pressure. Figure 1(a) reports the Gibbs energy of association, w(rmin), corresponding to the minimum of the potential of mean force (PMF) obtained with umbrella sampling (see supplementary material Fig. S1 for the PMF), as a function of the TMAO concentration (c3) in solution. These data are in qualitative agreement with previously reported calculations based on the free-energy perturbation method.26 The Gibbs energy of association displays a non-monotonic dependence on c3 and has a minimum at c3 = 1M, where the hydrophobic association is strongest. As was previously reported,26 preferential TMAO binding gives rise to two opposing thermodynamic driving forces that lead to such a non-monotonic dependence: An entropy loss associated with the accumulation of excess TMAO in the hydration shells of the two helices drives their association (i.e., drives a decrease of the overall nonpolar solvent-accessible surface area) at low bulk concentrations (c3 < 1M). However, when the bulk TMAO concentration is further increased, this effect is overcompensated by cohesive van der Waals interactions of TMAO with the two nonpolar solutes, leading to their dissociation. The concentration (c3) where the hydrophobic association is strongest thus depends on a delicate energy\u2013entropy balance linked to the weak binding of TMAO to nonpolar surfaces. This energy\u2013entropy balance changes under varying environmental conditions, such as pressure. High pressure. In pure water, pressure shifted the helix\u2013 association equilibrium toward the dissociated state, as indicated J. Chem.

This observation may be explained by a mechanism where the corresponding increase in water-accessible nonpolar surface area leads to reduced water crowding.7 Interestingly, at 2 kbar, the Gibbs energy of association also depended non-monotonically on c3, but the minimum at c3 = 2M was deeper and shifted to a larger value of c3 as compared to the data obtained at 1 bar. This observation is linked to the high-pressure polarization of the TMAO dipole that leads to stronger TMAO hydration and a correspondingly weaker preferential binding of TMAO to the two \u03b1-helical solutes, as will be demonstrated below. Therefore, a higher TMAO bulk concentration was required to reach the turning point where cohesive van der Waals interactions of TMAO with the two nonpolar solutes overcompensated the entropic driving force for their association. The shift of the Gibbs energy minimum caused by this mechanism led to the remarkable observation that at c3 = 2M, the two\ndata points in Fig. 1(a) almost merged, i.e., at this concentration, TMAO almost fully counteracted the pressure-induced destabilization of the hydrophobic interaction. Figure 2 summarizes the mechanism.\nWe repeated the high-pressure MD simulations using the lowdipole FF for TMAO. The corresponding data are shown in Fig. 1(b), together with the data obtained with the high-dipole FF. The TMAO stabilization effect observed with the high-dipole FF disappeared when the low-dipole FF was employed in the simulations at 2 kbar. A comparison of the data in Figs. 1(a) and 1(b) showed that the data obtained with the low-dipole FF at 2 kbar were shifted up along the vertical axis as compared to the data obtained with the low-dipole FF at 1 bar, while maintaining qualitatively the same non-monotic dependence on c3. This indicated that the high-pressure polarization of the TMAO dipole was essential in achieving the pressure stability of hydrophobic contacts.\nFIG. 2. Direct interaction mechanism: (Left) Partitioning of TMAO in the hydration shells of the nonpolar solutes enhances the forward association reaction and strengthens the hydrophobic contact interaction. The forward reaction is entropy-driven, i.e., it reduces the entropically unfavorable, non-uniform spatial distribution of solvent components due to bulk-interface partitioning of TMAO.27 Cohesive van der Waals interactions between TMAO and the nonpolar solutes drive the reverse reaction and enhance it at high bulk concentrations of TMAO. (Right) Polarization of the TMAO dipole under compression of the solvent at high pressure leads to weaker partitioning of TMAO in the hydration shells of the nonpolar solutes. Accordingly, TMAO\u2013solute van der Waals interactions are weaker as compared to the low-pressure scenario, and the forward reaction dominates the reverse reaction to a greater extent over a wider range of TMAO bulk concentrations.\nJ. Chem. Phys. 157, 201101 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0112485 157, 201101-3\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2022\n18 January 2024 21:29:51\nThe observations made with the high- and low-dipole FFs, as an alternative to the above explanation based on preferential binding, could stem from their effects on the difference in partial molar volumes, \u0394V2, upon helix association. Figure 3(a) reports the data obtained for \u0394V2 as a function of c3 for the low-dipole FF and the high-dipole FF at 1 bar and 2 kbar. The low-pressure data indicated that \u0394V2 decreased as c3 increased, i.e., at 1 bar, TMAO increased the pressure stability of the hydrophobic contact between the two \u03b1-helices. By contrast, this dependence disappeared at 2 kbar independent of whether the high-dipole FF or low-dipole FF was used. Because \u0394V2 did not depend on the TMAO dipole, the differences in the Gibbs energies of association [Fig. 1(b)] obtained at high pressure with the high- and low-dipole FFs originated from differences in preferential binding of TMAO to the \u03b1-helices.\nThe preferential binding coefficient (\u039323) is shown in Fig. 3(b) and confirms this conclusion. When pressure was raised from 1 bar to 2 kbar, \u039323 decreased. While this occurred with both the highand low-dipole FFs, \u039323 decreased more with the high-dipole FF, as expected based on the stronger TMAO\u2013water binding of the high-dipole model. Note that the data in Fig. 3(b), furthermore, show that \u039323 > 0, i.e., TMAO accumulated in the hydration shell of the \u03b1-helix and stabilized the hydrophobic contact interaction of the two helices through direct interactions, as indicated in Fig. 2. Positive preferential TMAO binding (\u039323 > 0) has been observed at air\u2013water and hydrophobic polymer\u2013water interfaces,28 and may be driven by solvent-crowding effects in bulk solution.29,30\nIn summary, the present work showed that the term \u201cpiezolyte\u201d aptly captures the effect of TMAO in terms of high-pressure stability of hydrophobic interactions. We proposed a stabilization mechanism that, by contrast to indirect depletion effects on protein stability, involves the role of weak van der Waals interactions. This direct interaction mechanism is based on two opposing thermodynamic driving forces: (1) an entropic force that strengthens the hydrophobic attraction between the extended nonpolar \u03b1-helices due to the natural tendency of adsorbed TMAO molecules to be assimilated by the bulk solution, (2) an enthalpic driving force that weakens the hydrophobic attraction between the extended nonpolar \u03b1-helices due to their cohesive van der Waals interaction with TMAO. The equilibrium of these two forces resulted in a minimum in the Gibbs energy of hydrophobic association upon\nchanging the concentration of TMAO at low and high pressure. The high-pressure minimum occurred due to the electronic polarization of TMAO and was deeper and shifted to a higher concentration of TMAO, indicating that an increased concentration of TMAO at high pressure provided a stabilizing environment for hydrophobic interactions. We speculate that this mechanism may play a role in the observed increase of the muscle TMAO content in teleosts with the depth of the catch,14 but leave a detailed analysis to further studies.\nWe emphasize that the present work involves hydrophobic interactions of model nonpolar solutes. Because TMAO is depleted from many protein surfaces,31 the mechanism described herein will probably play a subordinate role in pressure denaturation of proteins but may have implications for protein\u2013protein interactions driven by hydrophobic attraction between extended nonpolar surface patches. The piezolyte effect described herein resulted from nonspecific van der Waals interactions of TMAO with nonpolar surfaces and should therefore be generic for hydrophobic interactions under extreme pressure conditions.\nSee the supplementary material for the simulation methods including tables, supplemental text explaining the preferential binding coefficient, and supplemental figures showing the PMFs as a function of helix distance at different pressure values and TMAO concentrations.
