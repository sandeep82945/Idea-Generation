    "abstractText": "The nonleptonic decays Bd;s \u2192 K K\u0304 0 are reanalyzed in perturbative QCD approach, which is based on the kT factorization. In the Standard Model, the calculated branching fraction and longitudinal polarization fraction of Bd \u2192 K K\u0304 0 are in agreement with experimental measurements, while the predictions of Bs \u2192 K K\u0304 0 cannot agree with data simultaneously. The parameter that combines longitudinal polarization fractions and branching fractions is calculated to be L K K\u0304 0 1\u20444 12.7\u00fe5.6 \u22123.2 , which is also larger than that extracted from experimental measurements. We then study all observables by introducing a family nonuniversal Z0 boson in b \u2192 sqq\u0304 transitions. In order to reduce the number of new parameters, we simplify the model as possible. It is found that with the fixed value \u03c9Bs 1\u20444 0.55, these exists parameter space where all measurements, including the branching fraction, longitudinal polarization fraction, and LK K\u0304 0 -parameter, could be accommodated simultaneously. All our results and the small parameter space could be further tested in the running LHC experiment, Belle-II, and future high-energy colliders.",

INTRODUCTION\nIt is well known that B meson rare decays provide us an abundant source of information on QCD, CP violation, and new physics (NP) beyond the Standard Model (SM). In recent years, the anomalies such as R\u00f0D\u00f0 \u00de\u00de and RK\u00f0 \u00de observed in semileptonic B meson rare decays at large hadron collider (LHC) and B factories imply that the lepton flavor universality may be violated, which, in particular, are viewed as the signals of the effects of NP (for recent reviews, see, e.g., Refs. [1\u20134]). Unlike the semileptonic decays, the hadronic B decays suffer from larger uncertainties and are therefore more difficult to calculate with a high accuracy because the hadronic matrix elements cannot be calculated from the first principle directly. In the past 20 years, based on the factorization hypothesis [5], some QCD based approaches to handle such kinds of problems are usually discussed in the heavy quark limit and implemented by the heavy quark expansion, such as the lightcone sum rule (LCSR) [6], the QCD factorization (QCDF) [7,8], the soft-collinear effective theory (SCET) [9,10], and\nthe perturbative QCD (PQCD) factorization approach [11\u201313]. However, the observables such as the branching fractions, CP asymmetries, polarization fractions, and angular distributions might suffer from large uncertainties from higher-order and higher-power contributions. In this sense, in hadronic B decays, a deviation with respect to the SM prediction requires one to be much more conservative regarding these uncertainties than in the case of semileptonic B decays. For this reason, in order to search for the signals of NP in the hadronic heavy flavor particle decays, on the one hand, we should reduce the theoretical uncertainties as possible by preforming the higher-order and higher-power corrections with the developments of QCD technique, but on the other, we are encouraged to search for new observables that are insensitive to the theoretical uncertainties. Among the two-body B meson hadronic decays, it is of great interest to us that the decays Bd \u2192 K 0K\u0304 0 and Bs \u2192 K 0K\u0304 0 have same final states and are related by U spin. Both two decays are induced by the flavor-changing neutral-current (FCNC) transitions, in which new particles of NP could affect the observables by entering the loops. In addition, Bs \u2192 K 0K\u0304 0 decay is also regarded as a golden channel for a precision measurement of the CKM phase \u03b2s [14]. On the experimental side, both the branching fractions and the longitudinal polarization fractions have been measured in two B factories [15\u201317] and LHCb experiment [18\u201321]. For the decay Bd \u2192 K 0K\u0304 0, the theoretical predictions of the branching fraction and polarization *liying@ytu.edu.cn \u2020sunyanjun@nwnu.edu.cn Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

Furthermore, the measurement of fL\u00f0Bd \u2192 K 0K\u0304 0\u00de agrees with the na\u00efve hypothesis, based on the quark helicity conservation and the (V \u2212 A) nature of the weak interaction. For the decay Bs \u2192 K 0K\u0304 0, the latest averaged experimental results [25] are B\u00f0Bs \u2192 K 0K\u0304 0\u00de \u00bc \u00f011.1 2.7\u00de \u00d7 10\u22126, fL\u00f0Bs \u2192 K 0K\u0304 0\u00de \u00bc 0.240 0.031 0.025, and f\u22a5\u00f0Bs \u2192 K 0K\u0304 0\u00de \u00bc 0.38 0.11 0.04. It is found that the prediction of branching fraction B\u00f0Bs \u2192 K 0K\u0304 0\u00de \u00bc \u00f09.1\u00fe0.5\u00fe11.3\u22120.4\u22126.8 \u00de \u00d7 10\u22126 in QCDF [22] agrees well with the data, but the longitudinal polarization fraction fL\u00f0Bs \u2192 K 0K\u0304 0\u00de \u00bc 0.63\u00fe0.42\u22120.29 is much larger than the data. On the another side, based on PQCD approach [23], the predicted branching fraction and longitudinal polarization fraction are B\u00f0Bs \u2192 K 0K\u0304 0\u00de \u00bc \u00f05.4\u00fe3.0\u22122.4\u00de \u00d7 10\u22126 and fL\u00f0Bs \u2192 K 0K\u0304 0\u00de \u00bc 0.38\u00fe0.12\u22120.10 , respectively. It is seen that although the longitudinal polarization fraction fL is consistent with the data, its center value is a bit smaller than the experimental measurement. Altogether, the theoretical predictions with large uncertainties from two approaches cannot explain all available data convincingly. In order to explain the current data simultaneously, the theoretical predictions with high precision in both approaches are called, and we are also encouraged to explore the contributions of NP.

[27] defined an\nobservable that is sensitive to the U-spin asymmetry but with a cleaner theoretical prediction as\nLK 0K\u0304 0\n\u00bc B\u00f0Bs \u2192 K 0K\u0304 0\u00deg\u00f0Bs \u2192 K 0K\u0304 0\u00defL\u00f0Bs \u2192 K 0K\u0304 0\u00de\nB\u00f0Bd \u2192 K 0K\u0304 0\u00deg\u00f0Bd \u2192 K 0K\u0304 0\u00defL\u00f0Bd \u2192 K 0K\u0304 0\u00de ;\n\u00f01\u00de\nwhere the phase space factors g\u00f0BQ \u2192 K 0K\u0304 0\u00de involved in the corresponding branching fractions are given as\ng\u00f0BQ \u2192 K 0K\u0304 0\u00de \u00bc \u03c4BQ\n16\u03c0M2BQ\nffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi M2BQ \u2212 4M 2 K 0 q : \u00f02\u00de\nIn such a ratio, the experimental uncertainties are reduced, as the uncertainties in the denominator and numerator can be canceled out by each other. In [21], LHCb collaboration released the measurements of the ratio between two branching fractions and the longitudinal polarization fraction of Bs \u2192 K 0K\u0304 0. With the latest results and the longitudinal polarization fraction of Bd \u2192 K 0K\u0304 0 from PDG [25], we could obtain this new observable as\nLExpK K\u0304 \u00bc 4.43 0.92; \u00f03\u00de\nwhere the effect of Bs meson mixing in the measurement of the branching fraction is included. In QCDF, the prediction based on the results from [22] is given as [27]\nLQCDFK K\u0304 \u00bc 19.5\u00fe9.3\u22126.8 ; \u00f04\u00de\nwhich implies a 2.6\u03c3 tension with respect to the experimental data. This new \u201canomaly\u201d discrepancy is viewed as a new signal of NP [27]. However, LK K\u0304 of PQCD is not available yet till now. Motivated by this, we shall exploit this observable in PQCD in this work and try to check whether the LK K\u0304 is still lager than the experimental data. Moreover, the branching fractions and polarizations of both two decays will also be recalculated with the new fitted distribution amplitudes of K [28]. As aforementioned, in order to interpret the called RK and RK anomalies, a large number of NP models have been proposed. One of the most popular NP explanations are models with an extra heavy vector Z0 boson [29,30], where the new introduced Z0 boson has couplings to quarks, as well as to either electrons or muons with nonuniversal parameters. In order to test these models, besides searching Z0 at the higher energy colliders directly, the signals in other observables involving the similar transitions are also expected. A straightforward place to explore the possible existence of these signals are hadronic B decays induced by the FCNC transitions b \u2192 \u00f0d; s\u00deqq\u0304. In SM, such kind of decays are forbidden at tree level and only occur by loops. The comparable contributions from Z0 at tree level may change the observables remarkably. Hence, another purpose of this work is to explore whether the contributions of an extra Z0 boson can be used to explain all measured observables in some certain spaces of parameters. This paper is organized as follows. We will first present the calculations of Bd \u2192 K 0K\u0304 0 and Bs \u2192 K 0K\u0304 0 decays in SM within the PQCD approach, and more attentions are mainly paid not only on the branching fractions and the longitudinal polarization fractions but also on the new observable LK K\u0304 . In Sec. III, we will study contributions from the nonuniversal Z0 boson, which could change the observables in the suitable parameters space. Lastly, we shall summarize this work in Sec. IV."

They are nonperturbative but universal. Tr is the sum of degrees of freedom in the spin and color space. bi is the conjugate variable of the quark transverse momentum kiT , and xi is the longitudinal momentum fraction carried by the light quark in each meson. H\u00f0xi; bi; t\u00de describes the four quark operators and the spectator quark connected by a hard gluon and can be calculated perturbatively. The jet function St\u00f0xi\u00de coming from the threshold resummation of the double logarithms ln2 xi smears the end-point singularities in xi [32]. The Sudakov form factor e\u2212S\u00f0t\u00de arising from the resummation of the double logarithms suppresses the soft dynamics effectively, i.e., the long distance contributions in the large-b region [33,34]. The main advantage of this approach is that it preserves the transverse momenta of quarks and avoids the problem of end-point divergence. Because there are three kinds of polarizations for a vector\nmeson, namely longitudinal (L), normal (N), and transverse (T), the amplitudes for a B meson decay to two vector mesons are generally characterized by the polarization states of two vector mesons.

Figures 1(a) and 1(b) are factorizable emission diagrams, while 1(c) and 1(d) are nonfactorizable emission ones. Similarly, Figs. 1(e) and 1 (f) are factorizable annihilation diagrams, and 1(g) and 1(h) are nonfactorizable annihilation ones. We also note that in Bs \u2192 K 0K\u0304 0 decay, the final vector meson K\u0304 0 takes the spectator strange quark, while in Bd \u2192 K 0K\u0304 0 decay, the spectator down quark enters K 0 meson.

With above formulae, we then calculate the observables\nin SM. The branching fractions and longitudinal polarization fractions of both decays are given in Table I, together with predictions of QCDF and the available experimental\nFAMILY NONUNIVERSAL Z0 EFFECTS ON \u2026 PHYS. REV. D 106, 093009 (2022)\ndata. In our numerical calculations, the updated distribution amplitudes [28] of K are adopted. We acknowledge that there are still some uncertainties in our calculations, and we here only discuss two main uncertainties. In the table, the first errors arise from the wave functions of heavy B mesons, in which the shape parameters \u03c9Bd and \u03c9Bs are the only inputs, and we make them change 30%. The second ones are from the next-leading power (order) corrections characterized by the hard scale t, which changes from 0.8t to 1.2t. It can be seen that the branching fractions are affected by both parameters, while the polarization fractions are only sensitive to the shape parameter \u03c9Bd or \u03c9Bs. In PQCD, both B0d \u2192 K\n0K\u0304 0 and B0s \u2192 K 0K\u0304 0 are induced only by the penguin operators so that the direct CP asymmetries of two decays are zero in PQCD. However, including the contributions from charm penguins, the direct CP asymmetries from QCDF are nonzero. Thus, the measurements of direct CP asymmetries in future could discriminate two approaches. FromTable I, we find that for the decayB0 \u2192 K 0K\u0304 0, the predictions of branching fractions and polarization fractions from PQCD and QCDF are in agreement with the experimental results, though the theoretical center values of branching fraction are smaller than the experimental data. In fact, the longitudinal contribution is dominant, which is roughly proportional to the form factor AB\u2192K\n0 . In QCDF,\nAB\u2192K 0 \u00f00\u00de \u00bc 0.39 0.06 calculated from light-cone sum rules [41] was adopted, while AB\u2192K\n0 \u00f00\u00de \u00bc 0.36 0.05 is\nobtained in PQCD. In addition, the form factors AB\u2192K 1 \u00f00\u00de and VB\u2192K\n\u00f00\u00de that are related to transverse amplitudes are almost same in PQCD and QCDF. For the decay B0s \u2192 K 0K\u0304 0, the theoretical predictions are in agreement with eachotherwith uncertainties,withABs\u2192K\n0 \u00f00\u00de \u00bc 0.33\n0.05 in QCDF and ABs\u2192K 0 \u00f00\u00de \u00bc 0.30 0.05 in PQCD. However, in comparison to the experimental results, both branching fractions are smaller than the data, and both theoretical longitudinal polarization fractions are much larger than data; even the predictions of QCDF have large uncertainties arising from annihilation diagrams. In our previous study [23], with the large suppression from threshold resummation, the predicted longitudinal polarization fraction fL \u00bc \u00f038.3\u00fe12.1\u221210.5\u00de% could be comparable to data, but the corresponding branching fraction \u00f05.4\u00fe3.0\u22122.4\u00de \u00d7 10\u22126 is smaller than the current data. Although there are many uncertainties in the theoretical calculations, this discrepancy could be a hint of NP beyond SM. In recent years, the width effects of theK have been also\ndiscussed but with K\u03c0 distribution amplitudes instead of ones of K . It is shown that for the quasi-two-body decay B \u2192 K P3 \u2192 K\u03c0P3, the width effects is less than 10% [42]. Within the light-cone sum rules and the narrow-width limit, the authors in Ref. [43] also estimated the effect of a nonvanishing K width in B \u2192 K transitions and found that this effect is universal and increases the factorizable\npart of the rate of B \u2192 K X decays by a factor of 20%. Meanwhile, in Ref. [44], with the P-wave K\u03c0 distribution amplitudes, the four-body decays B\u00f0d; s\u00de \u2192 \u00f0K\u03c0\u00deP\u00f0K\u03c0\u00deP in the K\u03c0 invariant mass region around the K resonance have been investigated in PQCD approach, and our results are in agreement with theirs with uncertainties. Now, we calculate the LK K\u0304 0-parameter and obtain\nLPQCD K K\u0304 0 \u00bc 12.7\u00fe5.6\u22123.2 ; \u00f030\u00de\nwhere the uncertainty is mainly from the shape parameters in the distribution amplitudes of B0d and B 0 s mesons. The uncertainties taken by high-order corrections are almost canceled. In this sense, the more precise and reliable shape parameters of heavy mesons based on the nonperturbative approaches are needed. By comparison, we find our result is also larger than one from the current data, Eq. (3), though it is smaller than that of QCDF."

Supposing there is no mixing between Z and Z0, the Z0 term of the neutral-current Lagrangian in the gauge basis can bewritten as [45,46]\nLZ 0 \u00bc \u2212g0Z0\u03bc X i \u03c8\u0304 Ii\u03b3\u03bc\u00bd\u00f0\u03b5\u03c8L\u00deiPL \u00fe \u00f0\u03b5\u03c8R\u00deiPR \u03c8 Ij; \u00f031\u00de\nwhere \u03c8 Ii means the i-th family fermion, and the superscript I refers to the gauge interaction eigenstate. g0 is the gauge coupling constant at the electroweak scale MW , and PL;R \u00bc \u00f01 \u2213 \u03b35\u00de=2. The parameter \u03b5\u03c8L (\u03b5\u03c8R) denotes the left-handed (right-handed) chiral coupling. According to certain string constructions [47] or GUT models [48], the couplings can be family nonuniversal. When we change the weak basis to the physical one, FCNC\u2019s generally appear at tree level in both left-handed and right-handed sectors, explicitly, as\nBL \u00bc V\u03c8L\u03b5\u03c8LV\u2020\u03c8L ; BR \u00bc V\u03c8R\u03b5\u03c8RV\u2020\u03c8R ; \u00f032\u00de\nwhere V\u03c8L;R are unitary matrices. For simplicity, the righthanded couplings are supposed to be flavor diagonal. Therefore, the FCNC b \u2192 sq\u0304q (and q \u00bc u, d) transition can also be mediated by the Z0 at tree level, and the corresponding effective Hamiltonian has the form of\nHZ 0 eff \u00bc 2GFffiffiffi\n2 p g0MZ g1MZ0 2 BLsb\u00f0s\u0304b\u00deV\u2212A X q \u00f0BLqq\u00f0q\u0304q\u00deV\u2212A\n\u00fe BRqq\u00f0q\u0304q\u00deV\u00feA\u00de \u00fe H:c:; \u00f033\u00de\nLI, ZHAO, SUN, and ZOU PHYS.

For simplicity, we follow the assumptions in Refs. [49\u201355] and set BL;Ruu \u00bc \u22122BL;Rdd so that new physics is manifest in the EW penguins, namely O7 and O9. Furthermore, without loss of generality, the diagonal elements of the effective coupling matrices BL;Rqq are supposed to be real due to the hermiticity of the effective Hamiltonian. However, there is no constraint that the off-diagonal BLsb should be a real, and a new weak phase \u03d5bs can exist. Taking all these information together, we then have the new Wilson coefficients\n\u0394C3;5 \u2243 0; \u0394C9;7 \u00bc 4 jVtbV tsj VtbV ts \u03beL;Rei\u03d5bs ; \u00f036\u00de\nwith\n\u03beL;R \u00bc g0MZ g1MZ0 2 B L sbB L;R dd VtbV ts\n: \u00f037\u00de With the assumption that bothU\u00f01\u00deY in the SM andU\u00f01\u00de introduced in new models originate from the grand unified theory, the gauge coupling constants for Z and Z0 bosons are the same, implying that g0=g1 \u00bc 1. So far, the obvious signal of the new Z0 boson has not been observed in the current experiments such as CMS and ATLAS, which indicates that the mass of Z0 would be larger than the Tev scale. Conservatively, we set MZ=MZ0 \u2248 0.1. In order to accommodate the mass difference between B0s and B\u03040s ,\nwhich is one of the most strictest constraints to the models with Z0 boson, jBLsbj \u223c jVtbV tsj is theoretically required. Meanwhile, in order to explain the experimental data of B \u2192 K\u03c0, B \u2192 K\u03d5 and B \u2192 K \u03c0, the diagonal elements should satisfy jBL;Rqq j \u223c 1 [52,56,57]. For the newly introduced weak phase \u03d5bs, it is assumed to be a free parameter without any restriction. In order to reduce the number of new parameters, we further assume \u03be \u00bc \u03beLL \u00bc \u03beLR, which means that the left-handed couplings are same as righthanded ones. This simplification has not been adopted in previous studies. Therefore, in our following discussion, we have only two parameters \u03be \u2208 \u00bd0.001; 0.02 and \u03d5bs \u2208 \u00bd\u2212180\u00b0; 180\u00b0 . Alteratively, \u03beLL \u00bc 0 or \u03beLR \u00bc 0 can also be assumed, which correspond to different scenarios in Refs. [52,56,57]. Our discussions can be generalized to other cases directly, and we shall not discuss these cases any more.. In Figs. 2 and 3, we present the branching fraction and longitudinal polarization fraction of Bs \u2192 K 0K\u0304 0 as functions of the new weak phase \u03d5bs, for a fixed value \u03be \u00bc 0.01 with \u03c9Bs \u00bc 0.45, 0.50, and 0.55 in the left panels, and for a fixed \u03c9Bs \u00bc 0.50 with \u03be \u00bc 0.02, 0.01, and 0.005 in the right panels. The experimental data and the SM predictions are also shown in the figures for comparisons. As aforementioned, the experimental result and theoretical prediction of SM on the branching fraction have some overlaps, but there is no overlap on the longitudinal polarization fraction. From Table I, we could see that in the SM the uncertainty of the branching fraction arising from the \u03c9Bs is about 20%. With the fixed parameter \u03be \u00bc 0.01, for each \u03c9Bs , the uncertainties coming from the unknown phase \u03d5bs are also around 20%, as shown in the left panel of Fig. 2. Comparing the theoretical results with the data, a small \u03c9Bs is preferred by the experimental data. Given \u03c9Bs \u00bc 0.50, it is found from the right panel of Fig. 2 that if \u03be < 0.01, the contributions of the new particle would be plagued by the large theoretical uncertainties. However, when we set \u03be \u00bc 0.02, the effect from Z0 boson becomes more remarkable, and the branching fraction could be as large as 11.2 \u00d7 10\u22126 when \u03d5bs \u00bc 0\u00b0. Specifically, for \u03be \u00bc 0.02 and \u03c9Bs \u00bc 0.50, the new weak phase \u03d5bs is constrained in the range \u00bd\u2212100\u00b0; 100\u00b0 by the current data, and the range decreases as \u03be becomes smaller. In contrast to the branching fraction, the measured\nlongitudinal polarization fraction is smaller than the theoretical prediction, which allows us to find out some mechanisms to suppress the longitudinal contribution or enhance the transverse contributions. It can be seen from the left panel of Fig. 3 that for the fixed value \u03be \u00bc 0.01, most results are larger than the data, and only few results approach the upper limit of experimental data when \u03c9Bs \u00bc 0.55 and \u03d5bs \u2248 50\u00b0. Therefore, a larger \u03c9Bs is favored, which is different from the result from the well-measured branching fraction. It is shown in the right panel that, for\nFAMILY NONUNIVERSAL Z0 EFFECTS ON \u2026 PHYS. REV. D 106, 093009 (2022)\n093009-7\nthe fixed \u03c9Bs \u00bc 0.50, the theoretical predictions of longitudinal polarization fractions fL are larger than the data, for both \u03be \u00bc 0.01 and \u03be \u00bc 0.001. When \u03be \u00bc 0.02, fL changes in a wide range with the changes of \u03d5bs and could fall into the experimental range within \u03d5bs \u2208 \u00bd8\u00b0; 93\u00b0 . When \u03d5bs \u2248 50\u00b0, fL could be as small as 22%. From the above analysis, the branching fraction prefers a\nsmaller \u03c9Bs, while the longitudinal polarization fraction prefers a larger one. Also, we found that once \u03be \u00bc 0.02 is adopted, both the branching fraction and the longitudinal polarization fraction vary in a large region with the change of \u03d5bs. Thus, with \u03be \u00bc 0.02, we plot all possible regions for \u03c9Bs \u00bc 0.50 0.05 in Fig. 4. These two figures illustrate that for the fixed \u03be \u00bc 0.02, both of the two observables could be consistent with the experimental data well, even \u03c9Bs \u00bc 0.45 is adopted. In addition, a positive weak phase \u03d5bs is preferred, as implied in Fig. 4. Now, we shall discuss the effect of the new introduced Z0 boson on the new defined parameter LK K\u0304 0. As\naforementioned, we suppose that Z0 only participates in the b \u2192 s transitions, and its contribution to the FCNC b \u2192 d transitions is suppressed by small jBdbj and negligible. In this respect, LK K\u0304 0 does in fact reflect the contribution of longitudinal amplitude of decay B0s \u2192 K 0K\u0304 0. In the left panel of Fig. 5, we adopt \u03be \u00bc 0.01 again and show the variant of LK K\u0304 0 with changes of \u03d5bs for \u03c9Bs \u00bc 0.45, 0.50, and 0.55. The SM prediction and the latest measurement are also shown. By comparison, we find that if \u03be \u00bc 0.01, the theoretical predictions cannot agree with experimental data, even if \u03c9Bs \u00bc 0.55 is adopted. By setting \u03c9Bs \u00bc 0.45, 0.50, and 0.55, we also calculated LK K\u0304 0 . The numerical results show that if \u03be < 0.02, the values of \u03c9Bs \u00bc 0.45, 0.50 are not preferred by the experimental data. Thus, we adopt \u03c9Bs \u00bc 0.55 and plot LK K\u0304 0 dependence on the phase for \u03be \u00bc 0.001, 0.01, and 0.02 in the right panel. It can be clearly seen that LK K\u0304 0 changes in a wide range for \u03be \u00bc 0.02, and it could be 4.61 as \u03d5bs \u2248 75\u00b0. Combining Figs. 4 and 5, we find that in such\nLI, ZHAO, SUN, and ZOU PHYS. REV. D 106, 093009 (2022)\n093009-8\na family nonuniversal Z0 model, there might exist a certain parameter space, where all observables can be achieved. In order to obtain the parameter space, we show the combined result in the \u00f0\u03d5bs; \u03be\u00de two-dimensional plane for the fixed value \u03c9Bs \u00bc 0.55, as shown Fig. 6. The green and yellow bands represent the regions fitting the branching fraction and the longitudinal polarization fraction, respectively, while the region of the parameter space corresponding to a viable fit of LK K\u0304 0 has been marked in blue. Evidently, the experimental data of LK K\u0304 0 gives the most stringent constraint. As was expected, these three bands overlap in a very small region, \u03be \u2208 \u00bd0.017; 0.018 and \u03d5bs \u2208 \u00bd50\u00b0; 65\u00b0 . Within this small parameter space, we then have\nB\u00f0B0s \u2192 K 0K\u0304 0\u00de \u00bc \u00f08.6 0.4\u00de \u00d7 10\u22126; \u00f038\u00de\nfL\u00f0B0s \u2192 K 0K\u0304 0\u00de \u00bc\u00f019.5 0.7\u00de% \u00f039\u00de\nLPQCD K K\u0304 0 \u00bc 5.3 0.3: \u00f040\u00de\nThese results with few uncertainties could be further tested with high precision in the current LHCb experiment or the Belle-II experiment. Finally, we present some comments on the direct searches of Z0 boson. At LHC, the main way to search directly for a Z0 is via a resonance peak in the invariantmass distribution of its decay products. This experimental analysis is usually performed by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations for Z0 production in the s channel in a rather model-independent way but assuming that the observed new resonance is narrow, such that any interference of SM and NP contributions can be neglected. Under these assumptions, the Z0 Drell-Yan cross section at a hadron machine can be approximated as [25,58,59]\n\u03c3\u00f0pp \u2192 Z0X \u2192 ff\u0304X\u00de \u2243 \u03c0 6s X q cfqwq\u00f0s;MZ02\u00de; \u00f041\u00de\nwhere q \u00bc u, d, s, c, b. Here, the hadronic structure functions wq\u00f0s;MZ02\u00de are independent of the Z0 model and contain all information on parton distribution functions and QCD corrections. On the other hand, the coefficients cfq\nFAMILY NONUNIVERSAL Z0 EFFECTS ON \u2026 PHYS. REV. D 106, 093009 (2022)\n093009-9\ncontain all model-dependent information. Recently, ATLAS and CMS collaborations published the limits on MZ0 as a function of clu;d where l \u00bc e, \u03bc [60,61]. The lower mass limits of 5.15(4.56) TeV are set based on the sequential standard model (superstring-inspired model) [61], and the lower limits could reach 4.5 TeV for the E6-motivated Z0 boson [60]. However, our results are challenged by above measurements, because the combined parameter \u03be \u2208 \u00bd0.017; 0.018 implies that the large g0 or small MZ0 are needed, as shown in Eq. (37). We also note for high values of g0, the ratio g0=MZ0 can be quite large, which could spoil the narrow-width approximation. Besides, the current limits are all model dependent, and the model-independent analyses are not available yet. Therefore, the models with MZ0 \u2264 3\u20134 TeV required by flavor physics cannot be excluded totally by current data. We look forward to further searches of Z0 in the current LHC experiment or future high-energy colliders."

With the new fitted distribution amplitudes ofK , both the branching fractions and the polarization fractions are recalculated. Numerical results show that the theoretical results of Bd \u2192 K 0K\u0304 0 are in agreement with experimental measurements, while for the decay Bs \u2192 K 0K\u0304 0, the branching fraction and the longitudinal polarization fraction cannot agree with data simultaneously. We also explored the LK K\u0304 0-parameter that is a combination of polarization fractions and branching fractions in order to reduce the theoretical uncertainties. In SM, LPQCD\nK K\u0304 0 \u00bc 12.7\u00fe5.6\u22123.2 is obtained based on PQCD, which is still larger than the experimental data. In order to identify whether the deviations come from the contribution of new physics, the accuracy of theoretical calculations should be further improved in the future, for example, by exploring the wave function of heavy B meson. On the other side, we are also encouraged to search for the effects of NP beyond SM. Then, we interpreted these deviations by introducing a family nonuniversal Z0 boson in b \u2192 sqq\u0304 transition. In order to reduce the number of new parameters, we simplified the model as possible. With the large shape parameter \u03c9Bs \u00bc 0.55 in the distribution amplitude of Bs meson, it is in a small parameter space \u03be \u2208 \u00bd0.017; 0.018 and \u03d5bs \u2208 \u00bd50\u00b0; 65\u00b0 that these three measurements (branching fraction, longitudinal polarization fraction, and LK K\u0304 0-parameter) could be accommodated simultaneously. In such small parameter space, the theoretical uncertainties could be reduced remarkably. All our results are hopefully tested in LHCb experiment, Belle-II and future high-energy colliders."
