            "text": "The interest shown by Ryan1 in the recent study by Luton et al.2 is appreciated and the authors are grateful for the chance to respond.\nArterial blood gas analysis was considered inappropriate because non-invasive methods (pulse oximetry and capnography) were simple, correct, repeatable, and in keeping with the degree of hypercapnia reported previously. Peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO2) differences seen between standard operating attire (\u2018SOA\u2019) and type 3 personal protective equipment (PPE) (mean 1.1 percent) fell within the accuracy limits of pulse oximetry, but the measurements were paired using the same pulse oximeter, from a cohort of young and healthy doctors, minimizing bias. Operations while wearing type 3 PPE can often last up to 6 h and testing older, senior surgeons with associated co-morbidity may amplify these findings.\nThe definition of tolerance is to endure continued subjection to environmental conditions without adverse reaction. Prolonged exposure to subtle hypoxaemia has been associated with redox-activated coagulation, vascular endothelial dysfunction, and cognitive impairment. Although differences in SpO2 values while wearing PPE are statistically significant, they may be below the minimal clinically important difference (\u2018MCID\u2019) after only 1 h. The modest sample size was powered to evaluate the impact of PPE on cerebral dynamics regardless of sex, when comparing differences in global cerebral blood flow between sexes. The observed effect size was considerably lower (0.30), demanding a sample size of 352 (176 participants per group) to achieve a power of 0.801 (\u03b1 = 0.05, 1 \u2212 \u03b2 = 0.80).\nIn conclusion, tolerance of type 3 PPE is multifaceted and a challenge to examine in detail. The authors have made a statement based on their experience of wearing PPE in a clinical environment,\nevaluating the factors required to make critical decisions in the domains of cognition, namely visuospatial and executive motor function."
