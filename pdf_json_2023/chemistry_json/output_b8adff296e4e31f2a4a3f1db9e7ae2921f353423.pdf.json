    "abstractText": "Polychlorinated Biphenyl (PCB) congeners show a long persistence in the human body with elimination half-lives in the range of 1\u201320 years. Elimination involves xenobiotic-metabolizing Phase I (cytochrome P450, i.e., CYP) and conjugating Phase II enzymes, which can lead to the formation and retention of OH-PCBs, PCB sulfates, PCB glucuronides, and PCB methyl sulfones (MeSO2-PCBs) (Grimm et al. 2015). Metabolic profiles of PCB degradation are dramatically affected by chlorine substitution patterns with implications for PCB toxicity and elimination half-live. Dechlorination of PCBs is considered to detoxify higher-chlorinated PCBs and has been demonstrated in animal models and in human cell culture (Tulp et al. 1977) (Zhang et al. 2022). PCB28 is one of the quantitatively most important congeners of industrial PCB mixtures. Together with other lower-chlorinated PCBs (e.g., PCB52 and PCB101), it can be regularly detected in contaminated indoor environments (Schettgen et al. 2012; Kraft et al. 2018) and is found in the recycling of transformers and capacitors (Schettgen et al. 2011). There is experimental evidence from PCB28 that indicates a direct genotoxic effect and thus hints to possibly a direct carcinogenic effect (Vasko et al. 2018). We here show for the first time the partial dechlorination of PCB 28 to the dichlorinated monohydroxylated metabolite 3-OHCB15, which is formed by human CYP1A2 from PCB28 in addition to its already known trichlorinated metabolites.",

            "text": "The metabolism of PCB28 was analyzed in\u00a0vitro using recombinant human (rh)CYP1A2 expressed in E.coli (bactosomes), producing several monohydroxylated trichlorinated metabolites identified as 5-OH-PCB28 (M1, RT 18.76\u00a0min), 4-OH-PCB31 (M3, RT 18.28\u00a0min), and 3\u2032-OH-PCB28/ 4\u2032-OH-PCB25 (M4/M2, RT 17.09\u00a0min) by comparison with the authentic standards (Fig.\u00a01a and Table\u00a01) and thereby corroborating with the results found in our previous studies. In addition, a prominent ion peak appeared in the chromatogram at a retention time of 16.25\u00a0min. A comparison with the standard compounds with the closest retention time suggested that this peak resembled the hydroxylated metabolite of 4,4\u2032-dichlorobiphenyl (3-OH-CB15). To confirm metabolic origin of the above species, control experiments with no NADPH, no PCB28, or with heat inactivated bactosomes were conducted. Indeed, in the control experiments none of the metabolites were detected (Supplemental Fig.\u00a01). These data suggested that CYP1A2 formed a partially dechlorinated hydroxylated metabolite of PCB28 presumably via the classical lower-chlorinated (LC) PCB metabolism pathway including arene oxide intermediate formation (Fig.\u00a02a).\nFormer studies had shown that bactosomes might catalyze different reactions with different metabolites generated than with the corresponding enzymes expressed in eukaryotic cell cultures (Stiborov\u00e1 et\u00a0al. 2017). To rule out the possibility that CYP1A2 mediated dechlorination of PCB28 is specific for the prokaryotic expression system, we generated a transgenic HEK293 cell line stably overexpressing the human cDNA of CYP1A2. The presence of genomically integrated CYP1A2 cDNA cell clones was confirmed by polymerase chain reaction analysis (data not shown).\nFunctional expression of CYP1A2 could be demonstrated by conversion of the common substrate caffeine to the specific paraxanthine product (Supplemental Fig.\u00a02). Incubation of HEK293humanCYP1A2 cells with PCB28 leads to the formation of all 4 known monohydroxylated metabolites of PCB28 as expected, whereas in non-transgenic parental HEK293 cells metabolite formation could not be observed. In addition, HEK293humanCYP1A2 cells formed 3-OHCB15 from PCB28 (Fig.\u00a01b and Table\u00a01).\nTo find out whether metabolic formation of 3-OH-PCB15 occurs also in\u00a0vivo, we examined plasma samples from individuals in a cohort exposed to different PCB Aroclor mixtures (HELPcB cohort) (Kraus et\u00a0al. 2012) for the presence of 3-OH-CB15. Indeed, we found this metabolite in samples selected for high PCB28 concentrations (Fig.\u00a01c and Table\u00a01). Moreover, the concentration of 3-OH-CB15 correlated mainly with the concentration of the major PCB28 metabolites 4-OH-CB31 and 3\u00b4-OH-CB28 (Fig.\u00a02), both resulting from oxidation at the dichlorinated ring of the trichlorobiphenyl structure. In fact, there is indirect evidence (Song et\u00a0al. 2013) that 3-OH-PCB15 is also produced as a metabolite of PCB15, a potential minor component of commercial PCB mixtures such as various types of Aroclor (Supplemental Table\u00a01). Thus, as composition of Aroclor(s) to which the plasma donors were exposed to was not reported, we cannot completely exclude the possibility that 3-OH-PCB15 in their blood resulted from hydroxylation of PCB15.\nWe emphasize that\u2013\u2013contrary to the general view that dechlorination of PCBs is accompanied by their detoxification\u2013\u2013a more differentiated view must be taken in the case\n1 3\n0 1 2 3 0\n1\n2\n3\n4-OH-PCB31(M3)\n3-OH-PCB15\n4- O\nH -P\nC B3\n1\nR2= 0.5376 p \u2264 0.0001\n0 1 2 3 0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n5-OH-PCB28 (M1)\n3-OH-PCB15\n5- O\nH -P\nC B2\n8\nR2= 0.5305 p \u2264 0.0001\n0 1 2 3 0\n50\n100\n150\n200\nPCB28\n3-OH-PCB15\nPC B2\n8\nR2= 0.2625 p \u2264 0.0001\n0 1 2 3 0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n3\u00b4-OH-PCB28 (M4)\n3-OH-PCB15\n3\u00b4 -O\nH -P\nC B2\n8\nR2= 0.1942 p \u2264 0.0001\n0 1 2 3 0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n4\u00b4-OH-PCB25 (M2)\n3-OH-PCB15\n4\u00b4 -O\nH -P\nC B2\n5\nR2= 0.2771 p \u2264 0.0001\nb\na\n1 3\nof the WHO indicator congener PCB28. For PCB15 the formation of a hydroquinone (PCB15-HQ) via dihydroxylated intermediates was clearly demonstrated in vitro (Song et\u00a0al. 2013), and PCB15 also showed a mutagenic effect both in\u00a0vitro and in\u00a0vivo. Furthermore, PCB15 had a tumorigenic effect in an initiation\u2013promotion experiment after a single administration to rats, with a 100-fold higher incidence of preneoplastic foci/cm3 in the liver (Espandiari et\u00a0al. 2003). Even though its full extent is currently unclear in humans, the metabolism of PCB28 to hydroxylated PCB15 and further downstream hydroquinone metabolites should also be taken into account when assessing the potential risk of PCB mixtures.\nAcknowledgements This research work was supported with funds from the German Social Accident Insurance (DGUV) to PZ (grant number FB295).
