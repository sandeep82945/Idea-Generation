    "abstractText": "We study the nearly critical behaviour of holographic superfluids at finite temperature and chemical potential in their probe limit. This allows us to examine the coupled dynamics of the full complex order parameter with the charge density of the system. We derive an effective theory for the long wavelength limit of the gapless and pseudo-gapped modes by using analytic techniques in the bulk. We match our construction with Model F in the classification of Hohenberg and Halperin and compute the complex dissipative kinetic transport coefficient in terms of thermodynamics and black hole horizon data. We carry out an analysis of the corresponding modes and argue that at finite density the dispersion relations are discontinuous between the normal and the broken phase. We compare and contrast our results with earlier numerical work.",

            "text": "The holographic duality provides a laboratory to analyse the behaviour of large classes of strongly coupled systems [1, 2]. In a certain large N limit, large classes of field theories become dual to classical theories of gravity. Using holography as a tool kit is particularly helpful in dealing with real time physics when finite temperature and chemical potential are involved [3]. More generally, holography is a powerful tool to study field theories deformed by relevant deformations.\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 8\nThe geometries dual to the field theory thermal states are black holes of Hawking temperature equal to the field theory temperature. In the most well understood case of conformal field theories, the bulk geometries asymptote to Anti de-Sitter space (AdS). The chemical potentials for the charges of global symmetries are fixed by the asymptotic behaviour of the gauge fields dual to the corresponding field theory Noether current operators. Likewise, the deformation parameters of other irrelevant operators are fixed by the boundary conditions of their bulk duals at the time-like conformal boundary of AdS.\nIn this paper we will be particularly interested in the intersection two areas that holography has already seen many applications. The first one is the study of thermal phase transitions and symmetry breaking. One of the most prominent examples is the superfluid phase transition which was pioneered in [4, 5]. With applications in condensed matter physics in mind, examples where spacetime symmetries are broken were also realised holographically [6\u20139].\nFrom the point of view of the bulk theory, continuous phase transitions are driven by perturbative instabilities which can lead to spontaneous symmetry breaking in the stable phase. In such a case, a new gapless mode appears in the theory, the dual of the Goldstone mode. At the same time, the mode which drives the transition acquires a small gap which closes to zero when approaching the critical point. This gapless collective degree of freedom is precisely the Higgs/amplitude mode.\nThe second area of applied holography that we will be interested in this paper is the effective theory governing the dynamics of low energy modes close to the critical point and incorporate the almost gapless Higgs mode. In the language of superfluids, the usual description of hydrodynamics away from the critical point captures the long wavelength behaviour of the phase of the order parameter [10\u201313]. Our aim is to enlarge the effective theory to include fluctuations of its modulus.\nPapers with similar questions have appeared in the past. However, they either involved models which can be solved exactly close to the critical point [14, 15], or numerical techniques [16\u201319]. We chose to employ analytic techniques as we want to understand the universality of the underlying physics from a boundary theory point of view. The main tool in our construction will be the techniques we have recently developed in [20\u201323] to analyse dissipative effects in holographic theories. These will let us identify an equation of motion for the amplitude of the order parameter, a constitutive relation for the conserved electric current of the theory and a Josephson relation for a local chemical potential we will identify. In combination with the Ward identity for the global U(1) of the theory, these will constitute a closed system of equations.\nLater, we compare the resulting equations with those resulting from the Model F in the classification of Hohenberg and Halperin [24] and find exact agreement after a certain identification of the parameters in their model with our holographic results. As part of the matching procedure, we produce a holographic formula for the complex kinetic coefficient \u03930 in terms of black hole horizon data and thermodynamic quantities of the state. It would be interesting to compare model F to holography beyond linear response.1\n1See e.g. [25] for some recent numerical work in a direction along those lines.\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 8\nUsing our effective theory equations, we analyse the behaviour of quasinormal modes in the broken phase. By incorporating the dynamics of the almost gapless mode, we are able to commute the limits of zero gap and infinite wavelength for the fluctuations. Naively, one might expect that when holding the wavelength fixed, in the limit of small gap the modes should match with the ones of the normal phase. However, we show that this is true only at zero background chemical potential. Moreover, we analyse interesting pole collisions in the complex plane that happen in the crossover region.\nAs we will see, the discontinuity mentioned above is related to the fact that the modes of oscillation of the order parameter are different between the normal and the broken phase. In the normal phase we have two copies of the same mode coming from its real and imaginary parts. However, even though the background of the broken phase is continuously connected to that of the normal phase, the mode for the fluctuations of the order parameter involve its phase in a singular manner close to the critical point. This was already evidenced from the analysis of [22], at infinite wavelengths. Interestingly, we find that the mode for responsible charge diffusion is continuous.\nFinally, we carry out a few numerical checks in order to verify some of our analytic results. In particular, we focus on reproducing the dispersion relations for the quasinormal modes that our theory predicts. The model that we chose to apply our analysis to has been studied before in [16] and we chose to use exactly the same set of parameters that was used there. Both our analytical and numerical results indicate that the original suggestion of [16] regarding the \u201cdiffusion\u201d constant of the pseudo-diffusive mode is not accurate for small wavevectors. Interestingly, it only holds true for wavevectors of norm much larger than the gap and below any other UV scale of the theory.\nOur paper is organised in six main sections. In section 2 we present our holographic setup along with the necessary thermodynamics of the bulk geometries. In section 3 we employ our holographic techniques to extract all the necessary ingredients for our effective theory. In section 4 we state our theory in two equivalent ways and we write the constitutive relations of the current in terms of our hydrodynamic variables. In a separate subsection, we carry out the comparison with Model F of [24]. In section 5 we examine the behaviour of the quasinormal modes of our system in various limits and point out at its discontinuities. Section 6 is devoted to our numerical checks. We conclude with some discussion and conclusions in section 7."

As we will see, the phase transition we wish to study will be driven by either tuning the chemical potential \u00b5 or the deformation parameter \u03c6(s). Our results will be valid both at finite and at zero charge density.\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 8\nFor our purposes, it is sufficient to consider the bulk action,\nSbulk = \u222b d4x \u221a \u2212g ( \u2212 \u03c44 F \u00b5\u03bdF\u00b5\u03bd \u2212 1 2D\u00b5\u03c8D \u00b5\u03c8\u2217 \u2212 12\u2207\u00b5\u03c6\u2207 \u00b5\u03c6\u2212 V ) (2.1)\nwhere \u03c4 and V are in general functions of \u03c6, |\u03c8|2. The covariant derivative acts on the complex scalar according to D\u03c8 = \u2207\u03c8+ iqeA\u03c8 and the field strength of the gauge field is simply F = dA. For small values of our scalar fields, we will assume that the functions \u03c4 and V behave according to,\nV \u2248 12m 2 \u03c8 |\u03c8|2 + 1 2m 2 \u03c6 \u03c6 2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\n\u03c4 \u2248 1 + c\u03c8 |\u03c82|+ c\u03c6 \u03c6+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (2.2)\nFor the bulk geometry dual to the thermal state, we will consider a general metric which preserves the Euclidean subgroup and time translations. Without any loss of generality, this is captured by the general metric,\nds2 = \u2212U(r)dt2 + dr 2\nU(r) + e 2g(r)(dx2 + dy2) . (2.3)\nOne can arrive to this background in a variety of ways and the details will not be important to our analysis. As we will see, what matters is the general properties of the background geometry (2.3). The conformal boundary is at r \u2192\u221e and we can use the coordinate invariance of the background theory to fix the horizon r = 0. In the asymptotic region, the functions that appear in our metric can be taken to approach,\nU(r) = (r +R)2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , g(r) = ln (r +R) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (2.4)\nWe will set the Hawking temperature of the horizon to be T , fixing the near horizon Taylor expansion,\nU(r) = 4\u03c0Tr + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , g(r) = g(0) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (2.5)\nSince we will be primarily interested in the broken phase of our probe theory, the complex scalar \u03c8 will be non-trivial in the bulk geometry. In this case, the field redefinitions \u03c8 = \u03c1 eiqe\u03b8 and B\u00b5 = \u2202\u00b5\u03b8+A\u00b5 are legitimate. This, brings our bulk action (2.1) to the form,\nS = \u222b d4x \u221a \u2212g ( \u2212 \u03c44F 2 \u2212 12\u2207\u00b5\u03c1\u2207 \u00b5\u03c1\u2212 12\u2207\u00b5\u03c6\u2207 \u00b5\u03c6\u2212 12q 2 e\u03c1 2B2 \u2212 V ) , (2.6)\nwhere the field strength now reads F = dB. The resulting equations of motions from a variation of the action (2.6) are given by,\n\u2207\u00b5\u2207\u00b5\u03c1\u2212 \u2202\u03c1V \u2212 q2\u03c1B2 \u2212 1 4\u2202\u03c1\u03c4F 2 = 0 ,\n\u2207\u00b5\u2207\u00b5\u03c6\u2212 \u2202\u03c6V \u2212 1 4\u2202\u03c6\u03c4F 2 = 0 ,\n\u2207\u00b5(\u03c4F\u00b5\u03bd)\u2212 q2e\u03c12B\u03bd = 0 . (2.7)\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 8\nIn our construction we will consider background solutions of these equations that correspond to deforming the theory by a chemical potential \u00b5 and scalar deformation parameter \u03c6s. To achieve this, we will consider backgrounds with\n\u03c1 = \u03c1(r) , \u03c6 = \u03c6(r) , B = Bt(r) dt . (2.8)\nNear the horizon at r = 0, regularity imposes the expansion,\n\u03c1(r) = \u03c1(0) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03c6(r) = \u03c6(0) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Bt(r) = B(0)t r + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (2.9)\nwhere \u03c1(0), \u03c6(0) and B(0)t are constants of integration which need to fixed. Close to the conformal boundary at r \u2192 \u221e, our physical considerations suggest the power series expansions,\n\u03c1(r) = \u03c1s (r +R)3\u2212\u2206\u03c8 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ \u03c1v (r +R)\u2206\u03c8 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\n\u03c6(r) = \u03c6s (r +R)3\u2212\u2206\u03c6 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ \u03c6v (r +R)\u2206\u03c6 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\nBt(r) = \u00b5\u2212 %\nr +R + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (2.10)\nwhere the conformal dimensions \u2206\u03c8 and \u2206\u03c6 of the dual operators O\u03c8 and O\u03c6 are fixed by the bulk masses according to \u2206\u03c8 (\u2206\u03c8 \u2212 3) = m2\u03c8 and \u2206\u03c6 (\u2206\u03c6 \u2212 3) = m2\u03c6. For the purposes of this paper, we will be setting the complex scalar source \u03c1s equal to zero. In terms of the backgrounds, this will guarantee that we have no explicit breaking of the U(1) symmetry. The constant of integration \u00b5 is the field theory chemical potential and % is the corresponding charge density. It is worth noting, that our background thermal states will eventually be parametrised by the temperature T , the chemical potential \u00b5 and the scalar deformation parameter \u03c6s. It is now worth describing the phase diagram of the system we are considering. Its precise details will depend on the parameters of our theory. For our purposes, we will be interested in the class of theories where a thermal phase transition does take place. In this case, for some fixed values of T and scalar deformation \u03c6s, there is a critical value for the chemical potential \u00b5c(T, \u03c6s) above which we can find solutions with a source-free non-trivial \u03c1. These backgrounds correspond to the thermal states of the broken phase. The hypersurface (T, \u03c6s, \u00b5c(T, \u03c6s)) defines a critical surface on which the energy difference between the broken and the normal phase is exactly zero. In the following sections, we will consider phase transitions which are driven by holding the T fixed and varying \u03c6s and \u00b5."

            "heading": "2.1 Holographic renormalisation and thermodynamics",
            "text": "In this subsection we will present some of the thermodynamic properties of our system that will be useful in our construction. The first step in extracting meaningful quantities form the boundary theory point of view is holographic renormalisation [26]. Equally important is the fact that holographic renormalisation is crucial in order to make the variational problem well defined in the bulk [27]. In order to render the bulk action (2.1) finite, a\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 8\nsuitable set of boundary counterterms is required. The precise form can depend on the details of the theory but a universal set of counterterms is given by,\nSbdr = \u2212 1 2 \u222b \u2202M d3x \u221a \u2212\u03b3 [ (3\u2212\u2206\u03c6)\u03c62 \u2212 1 2\u2206\u03c6 \u2212 5 \u2202a\u03c6\u2202 a\u03c6 ]\n\u2212 12 \u222b \u2202M d3x \u221a \u2212\u03b3 [ (3\u2212\u2206\u03c8)|\u03c8|2 \u2212 1 2\u2206\u03c8 \u2212 5 Da\u03c8D a\u03c8\u2217 ] + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (2.11)\nwhere \u03b3\u03b1\u03b2 is the induced metric on the asymptotic hypersurface \u2202M of constant radial coordinate r. The higher order terms can include higher derivatives of the bulk fields which in our approximation become irrelevant. In order to find the probe\u2019s contribution to the free energy of the system, one must Wick rotate to Euclidean time \u03c4 = i t and evaluate the total on-shell action Itot = Ib+Ibdr. More precisely, since our system is infinite, one should evaluate the probe\u2019s contribution to the free energy density wFE = T Itot in the x\u2212 y plane. In this paper, we will be ignoring the backreaction of the matter fields of our probe theory (2.1) on the background geometry. This makes meaningful to keep the temperature T fixed even during the real time evolution of the system. Given that we are only considering variations of the chemical potential \u03b4\u00b5 and the scalar deformation parameter \u03b4\u03c6s, the first law for the grand canonical free energy wFE becomes,2\n\u03b4wFE = \u2212% \u03b4\u00b5\u2212 \u3008O\u03c6\u3009 \u03b4\u03c6s , (2.12)\nwhere % = \u3008J t\u3009 is the charge density of the theory and \u3008O\u03c6\u3009 is the VEV of the neutral scalar operator. In contrast to the electric charge, the expectation value \u3008O\u03c6\u3009 is not a conserved quantity. However, from the statistical physics point of view we can still consider the variation of the free energy with respect to one of the couplings of the theory. Such variations would show up as extra terms in the first law like the last term in (2.12). More generally, we can define the expectation value \u3008J\u00b5\u3009 of the conserved U(1) current operator. For later reference, it will also be useful to define the thermodynamic susceptibilities through variations of % and \u3008O\u03c6\u3009 as functions of \u00b5 and \u03c6s,\n\u03b4% = \u03c7QQ \u03b4\u00b5+ \u03bd\u00b5 \u03b4\u03c6s , \u03b4\u3008O\u03c6\u3009 = \u03bd\u00b5 \u03b4\u00b5+ \u03bd\u03c6 \u03b4\u03c6s . (2.13)\nAnother quantity that will prove useful later is the horizon charge density,\n%h = e2g (0) \u03c4 (0)B (0) t . (2.14)\nBy using the equation of motion for the vector field in (2.7), one can show that in the normal phase, the horizon charge density is equal to the density %. However, this is not true for the broken phase black holes since the bulk vector field becomes massive and Stokes\u2019 theorem doesn\u2019t apply.\n2We should note that in the presence of persistent superfluid currents, the first law contains additional terms [15, 28, 29] which we can ignore in our case.\n\u2013 6 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 8\nWe will follow very similar techniques to those of [20, 21]. For this reason, we note that the VEVs around which we will construct our effect theory can be extracted from,\n\u3008J\u00b5\u3009 = lim r\u2192\u221e r5\u221a \u2212\u03b3\n[ \u2202L\n\u2202(\u2202rB\u00b5) + \u03b4S\n\u2032 bdr\n\u03b4B\u00b5\n] ,\n\u3008O\u03c6\u3009 = lim r\u2192\u221e r3\u221a \u2212\u03b3\n[ \u2202L\n\u2202(\u2202r\u03c6) + \u03b4S \u2032 bdr \u03b4\u03c6\n] ,\n\u3008O\u03c8\u3009 = lim r\u2192\u221e r3\u221a \u2212\u03b3\n[ \u2202L\n\u2202(\u2202r\u03c8\u2217) + \u03b4S\n\u2032 bdr\n\u03b4\u03c8\u2217\n] , (2.15)\nwhere L is the Lagrangian density of the bulk action (2.6). The above formulae are going to be directly useful to us when we consider the symplectic current of the theory. Finally, we note that the electric current satisfies the Ward identity,\n\u2207a\u3008Ja\u3009 = qe 2i (\u03bb \u3008O\u03c8 \u2217\u3009 \u2212 \u03bb\u2217 \u3008O\u03c8\u3009) . (2.16)\nIn the above, the parameter \u03bb is the source for the complex scalar operator O\u03c8. Apart from the thermodynamic quantities defined above, we would like to define the stiffness parameter wij , in a very similar way it was done in [30, 31]. One can imagine, that instead of the homogeneous background that we consider in this paper, we could have a more general family of background which break translations with a characteristic spatial wavevector ki. For example these broken phase backgrounds would be driven by a static mode of the form,\n\u03b4\u03c1 = \u03b4\u03c1(r) cos(k1 x+ cx) cos(k2 y + cy) , (2.17)\nwhere cx and cy are the zero modes of the Goldstone modes for translations. The corresponding backgrounds will then also be parametrised by the periods 2\u03c0/kx and 2\u03c0/ky and so will the free energy wFE . Following very similar arguments with [31], we can easily show the bulk expression,\nwij = \u2202ki\u2202kjwFE \u2223\u2223\u2223 ki=0 = \u03b4ij \u222b \u221e 0 dr \u03c12(r) = \u03b4ij \u03b3 . (2.18)\nA defining characteristic of the superfluid phase is the appearance of persistent supercurrents. The thermodynamic conjugate variables of these is the spatial components of the source for the electric currents \u03b4\u00b5i, or more precisely the gauge invariant combination \u03b4\u00b5i + \u2202i \u03b4\u03b8v, with \u03b4\u03b8v the phase of the complex VEV \u3008O\u03c8\u3009. This, can be read off from the asymptotic behaviour of the phase,\n\u03b4\u03b8 \u2248 (r +R)2\u2206\u03c8\u22123 \u03b4\u03b8(s) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ \u03b4\u03b8(v) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (2.19)\nFrom the point of view of the variables we have chosen to work which, the asymptotics of the phase field are encoded in the asymptotic behaviour of the gauge invariant one-form field components along the field theory directions according to,\n\u03b4B\u03b1 = \u2202\u03b1\u03b4\u03b8(s)\n(r +R)3\u22122 \u2206\u03c1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ \u03b4m\u03b1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ \u03b4j\u03b1 r +R + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (2.20)\nwhere m\u03b1 = \u2202\u03b1\u03b8(v) + \u03b4\u00b5\u03b1 is the gauge invariant combination of the sources.\n\u2013 7 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 8\nThe final thermodynamic quantity we would now like to discuss it the current susceptibility \u03c7JJ . If we wanted to consider all possible thermal states of our superfluids, we would have to include backgrounds in (2.8) which contain these supercurrents. In the present work, we wish to study the effective theory around states with zero supercurrents. However, these supercurrents will be relevant to our us from a perturbative point of view, as they will be involved in the hydrodynamic modes we will consider. From the bulk point of view, our broken phase backgrounds admit a non-trivial perturbation for the bulk one-form field of the form,\n\u03b4Bi = \u03b4Bii(r)dxi (2.21)\nwhich behaves near the boundary behaves as,\n\u03b4Bii = \u03b4mi \u2212 \u03c7JJ \u03b4mi r +R + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (2.22)\nand \u03c7JJ is precisely the current susceptibility. Near the horizon, regularity imposes the behaviour,\n\u03b4Bii = a (0) J \u03b4mi + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (2.23)\nIs is useful to note that given the perturbation \u03b4Bii , the equation of motion for the gauge field gives the relation,\n\u03c7JJ \u03b4mi = q2e \u222b \u221e\n0 dr \u03c12 \u03b4Bii . (2.24)\nGiven the fact that close to the phase transition we have approximately \u03b4Bii \u2248 \u03b4mi everywhere in the bulk, using the above equation it is easy to argue that close to the phase transition we must have,\n\u03b3 = \u03c7JJ q2e + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (2.25)\nWe may have used holography to show this relation but the deeper reason is gauge invariance with respect to the external source for the current."

At the same time, the background will have to change with \u03b5 accordingly. By expanding the equations of motion (2.7), we can establish that the correction for the background will admit an \u03b5 expansion of the form,\n\u03c1 = \u03b5\u03b4\u03c1?(0) + \u03b53\n3! \u03b4\u03c1?(2) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\n\u03c6 = \u03c6c + \u03b52\n2! \u03b4\u03c6?(2) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\nBt = ac + \u03b52\n2! \u03b4a?(2) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (3.2)\nalong the broken phase.

For the normal phase expansion we can write the corresponding relations,\n\u03b4%#(2) = \u03c7 # QQ \u03b4\u00b5#(2) + \u03bd # \u00b5 \u03b4\u03c6s#(2) ,\n\u03b4\u3008O\u3009#(2) = \u03bd#\u00b5 \u03b4\u00b5#(2) + \u03bd # \u03c6 \u03b4\u03c6s#(2) . (3.8)\nIn the hydrodynamic limit we can write the expressions,\n\u03b4\u3008O\u03c6\u3009?(2) = (2 \u2206\u03c6 \u2212 3) \u03b4\u03c6v?(2) , \u03b4\u3008O\u03c6\u3009#(2) = (2 \u2206\u03c6 \u2212 3) \u03b4\u03c6v#(2) , (3.9)\nbut for us, it is the asymptotic form of the symplectic current that will play a direct role in our analysis. Finally, it is worth noting for the normal phase we have the additional relation \u03b4%#(2) = e2g (0) \u03c4 (0)\u03b4a (1) #(2). This is nothing but our earlier statement that in the normal phase the horizon charge density (2.14) is equal to the field theory one. Another important part of our strategy is the set of static perturbations we will use in the Crnkovic-Witten symplectic current. Similarly to [22], the first static perturbation we will need is can be obtained from the broken phase background expansion (3.2). Taking a derivative with respect to \u03b5 we find the static perturbation,\n\u03b4\u03c1? = \u03b4\u03c1?(0) + \u03b52\n2! \u03b4\u03c1?(2) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\n\u03b4\u03c6? = \u03b5 \u03b4\u03c6?(2) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03b4B?t = \u03b5 \u03b4a?(2) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (3.10)\nThis fluctuation will play a double role in our construction. The first one is as we described above, it will be used as one of the two solutions in the symplectic current. The second role is that it will be used to construct the next to leading order hydrodynamic perturbation we wish to study with our effective theory. For the same reason, we will also consider the\n\u2013 10 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 8\nexpansion along the normal phase (3.4) and take a derivative with respect to \u03b5 to find the perturbation,\n\u03b4\u03c1# = 0 , \u03b4\u03c6# = \u03b5 \u03b4\u03c6#(2) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\n\u03b4B#t = \u03b5 \u03b4a#(2) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (3.11)\nThe second static solution that we will use in the symplectic current is the perturbation for the supercurrent of equation (2.21). Since our effort is to extract information infinitesimally close to the critical point, we will also need to consider the \u03b5 expansion of that as well,\n\u03b4Bii = \u03b4Bii(0) + \u03b5 2\u03b4Bii(2) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n\u03c7jj = \u03b52\u03c7jj(2) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 a (0) J = 1 + \u03b5 2a (0) J(2) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (3.12)\nwhere the zeroth order solution is simply \u03b4Bii(0) = \u03b4mi, as can be seen by solving the one-form field equation of motion (2.7) in the normal phase with \u03c1 = 0. This is exactly the argument we used to show the relation (2.25)."

            "text": "Before specialising to the low frequency, long wavelength fluctuations we are interested in, it is worth setting up the problem for a generic perturbation that depends on the field theory coordinates. By exploiting the translations in space and time, we will assume a Fourier decomposition of the form,\n\u03b4F(r, t, x) = e\u2212i\u03c9(t+S(r))+i\u03b5qx\u03b4f(r) , (3.13)\nfor bulk fields. The function S(r) a function which behaves near the horizon as S(r) = ln r 4\u03c0T + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 and vanishes sufficiently fast at the boundary. We will consider the quasinormal modes in the longitudinal sector and we will ignore the y component of the gauge field as it is decoupled from the rest. Our goal is to describe the system near the critical point and for this reason we take the momentum to be of order \u03b5q \u223c \u221a \u03b4\u00b5, \u221a \u03b4\u03c6s. Given the above behaviour for the function S near the horizon, imposing regular ingoing boundary conditions near the horizon leads to the expansions,\n\u03b4\u03c1(r) = \u03b4\u03c1(0) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\n\u03b4\u03c6(r) = \u03b4\u03c6(0) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\n\u03b4bx(r) = \u03b4b(0)x + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03b4bt(r) = \u03b4b(0)t + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\n\u03b4br(r) = \u03b4b\n(0) t\n4\u03c0Tr + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 .

(3.15)\nHowever, for the purposes of this paper we will be interested in the source free dynamics of the low energy modes. For this reason, we will aim to set the scalar and current sources \u03b4\u03c6s, \u03b4\u03c1s, \u03b4\u00b5a equal to zero. By following arguments very similar to [22], we can show that the degrees of freedom we wish to describe are captured by the expansion,\n\u03c9 = \u03b52 \u03c9[2] + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\n\u03b4\u03c1 = \u03b4\u03c1\u0303(0) + \u03b5 \u03b4\u03c1\u0303(1) + \u03b52\n2 \u03b4\u03c1\u0303(2) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\n\u03b4\u03c6 = \u03b5 \u03b4\u03c6\u0303(2) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03b4bt = \u03b5 \u03b4a\u0303(2) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03b4bx = \u03b4b\u0303x(0) + \u03b5 \u03b4b\u0303x(1) + \u03b52 \u03b4b\u0303x(2) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03b4\u03b8v = 1 \u03b5 \u03b4\u03b8\u0303v + \u03b4\u03b8\u0303v(0) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (3.16)\nBy expanding the equations of motion in \u03b5, we can see that the only solution regular at the horizon for \u03b4b\u0303x(0), \u03b4b\u0303x(1) is just a constant. Moreover, the equations of motion for the fields {\u03b4\u03c1\u0303(0), \u03b4a\u0303(2), \u03b4\u03c6\u0303(2)} are solved by a linear combination of the following solutions {\u03b4\u03c1\u0303(0) = 0, \u03b4a\u0303(2) = \u03b4a#(2), \u03b4\u03c6\u0303(2) = \u03b4\u03c6#(2)} and {\u03b4\u03c1\u0303(0) = \u03b4\u03c1?(0), \u03b4a\u0303(2) = \u03b4a?(2), \u03b4\u03c6\u0303(2) = \u03b4\u03c6?(2)}. Finally, note that we can add a constant (everywhere in the bulk) to \u03b4a\u0303(2), which we will call for convenience \u2212i\u03c9[2]\u03b4\u03b80, and get another solution. As a result we can write,\n\u03b4\u03c1\u0303(0) = \u03b4a \u03b4\u03c1?(0) , \u03b4a\u0303(2) = \u03b4a \u03b4a?(2) \u2212 \u03b4a#(2) \u2212 i\u03c9[2]\u03b4\u03b80 , \u03b4\u03c6\u0303(2) = \u03b4a \u03b4\u03c6?(2) \u2212 \u03b4\u03c6#(2) , \u03b4b\u0303x(0) = iq \u03b4\u03b8\u0303v . (3.17)\nAn important point is that the parameters \u03b4\u00b5\u2217(2) and \u03b4\u03c6\u2217(2) defining the broken phase variation in the above equations are identical to the variations of the background. This can be easily seen by inspection of the equations of motion. However, the variations \u03b4\u03c6s#(2) and \u03b4\u00b5#(2) are left undetermined by simply looking at the equations of motion. Regarding the neutral scalar, the net deformation for the hydrodynamic perturbation is,\n\u03b4\u03c6\u0303s(2) = \u03b4a \u03b4\u03c6s\u2217(2) \u2212 \u03b4\u03c6s#(2) . (3.18)\n\u2013 12 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 8\nThe requirement for zero total deformations suggests that \u03b4\u03c6s#(2) should be such that \u03b4\u03c6\u0303s(2) = 0. Finally, the variation parameter \u03b4\u00b5#(2) will be determined by imposing the electric current conservation Ward identity (2.16). Note that the Ward identity does not provide any non-trivial information about the static perturbations of the backgrounds. However, it is going to be essential in fixing \u03b4\u00b5#(2).\nFor the electric current of the theory, the electric current follows the \u03b5 expansion,\n\u03b4jt = \u03b5 \u03b4jt[1] + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03b4jx = \u03b52 \u03b4jx[2] + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (3.19)\nwhich is compatible with the expansion of the vector field in equation (3.20). The above to the identifications of the asymptotic data,\n\u2212i\u03c9[2]\u03b4\u03b8\u0303v = \u03b4a \u03b4\u00b5?(2) \u2212 \u03b4\u00b5#(2) \u2212 i\u03c9[2]\u03b4\u03b80 0 = \u03b4a \u03b4\u03c6s?(2) \u2212 \u03b4\u03c6s#(2)\n\u03b4jt[1] = \u2212\u03b4a \u03b4%?(2) + \u03b4%#(2) \u03b4\u03c6\u0303v(2) = \u03b4a \u03b4\u03c6v?(2) \u2212 \u03b4\u03c6v#(2) . (3.20)\nAt the same time, the above lead to the near horizon behaviour for the time component of the on-form field,\n\u03b4a\u0303(2) = \u2212i\u03c9[2]\u03b4\u03b80 + (\u03b4a \u03b4a (1) ?(2) \u2212 \u03b4a (1) #(2)) r + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (3.21)\nThe radial component of the one-form field admits the \u03b5 expansion,\n\u03b4br = \u03b5\u03b4b\u0303r(1) + \u03b52\n2 \u03b4b\u0303r(2) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (3.22)\nNear the horizon, the equation of motion (2.7) and regularity (3.14) yields the constraint,\ni\u03c9[2] ( q2\u03c4 (0)c e \u22122g(0) + q2e ( \u03b4\u03c1 (0) ?(0) )2) \u03b4\u03b80 = i\u03c9[2] \u03b4%\u0303h(2)e\u22122g (0) + i\u03c4 (0)c q2\u03c9[2]e\u22122g (0) \u03b4\u03b8\u0303v . (3.23)\nAs we will later see, this is the first equation that will be part of our effective theory and it will play the role of a Josephson relation."

For the theory described by the bulk action (2.6), the symplectic current density is given by,\nP\u00b5\u03b41,\u03b42 = \u03b41B\u03b1 \u03b42 ( \u2202L \u2202(\u2202\u00b5B\u03b1) ) + \u03b41\u03c1 \u03b42 ( \u2202L \u2202(\u2202\u00b5\u03c1) ) + \u03b41\u03c6 \u03b42 ( \u2202L \u2202(\u2202\u00b5\u03c6) ) \u2212 (1\u2194 2) , (3.24)\nwhere \u03b41 and \u03b42 denote any two perturbations which solve the equations of motion (2.7).

The second one is P\u03b4H,\u03b4mx , made out of the static perturbation (2.21).

We will do this in two different ways, using two different sets of variables. In the first approach, we will write a constitutive relation for the electric current in terms of the chemical potential and the amplitude and phase of the condensate. The effective theory will then be complete by fixing a Josephson relation and a first order time evolution equation for the amplitude of the order parameter. When combined with the Ward identity (2.16), we obtain a closed system of equations for the dynamics of the system. The second approach uses an effective energy potential which allows us to write the equations of motion for the charge density and the amplitude and phase of the condensate as a system of first order equations in time. This will allow us to compare with the Model F in the classification of Hohenberg and Halperin [24]."

For this purpose, the most straightforward set of variables is the phase of the order parameter \u03b4\u03b8\u0303v, the variable \u03b4\u03b80 and \u03b4a which parametrises the amplitude of the order parameter according to,\n\u3008O\u03c8\u3009 = \u2206\u3008O\u03c8\u3009b ( 1 + \u03b5\u22121 \u03b4a+ i qe \u03b4\u03b8v ) , (4.1)\nwith \u2206\u3008O\u03c8\u3009 = (2 \u2206\u03c8 \u2212 3) \u03b5 \u03b4\u03c1v\u2217(0) + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , the VEV of the complex scalar operator in the thermal state. For later convenience, we will define the new amplitude variable, \u03b4a\u0303 = \u03b4a/\u03b5. However, we still have the variation variable \u03b4\u00b5# in our description which can be specified by the first line of (3.20). An alternative description, which seems more natural from the hydrodynamics point of view, is to maintain the phase \u03b4\u03b8\u0303v, the amplitude \u03b4a and to trade \u03b4\u00b5#(2) for the chemical potential variation defined by,\n\u03b4\u00b5\u0303 = \u03b5 ( \u03b4\u00b5\u2217(2) \u03b4a\u2212 \u03b4\u00b5#(2) ) .

In the above we have reinstated factors of \u03b5 and Fourier transformed back to a coordinate space description and we have also introduced the incoherent conductivity \u03c3d = \u03c4 (0). Recasting equation (3.23) in terms of our new variables then provides a Josephson relation for the chemical potential variation \u03b4\u00b5\u0303,\nq2ee 2g(0) ( \u2206\u03c1(0) )2 \u2202t\u03b4\u03b8v = ( \u03c7#QQ \u2202t \u2212 \u03c3d \u2202i\u2202 i + q2e e2g (0) (\u2206\u03c1(0))2) \u03b4\u00b5\u0303+ 2 \u2206%h \u2202t\u03b4a\u0303 . (4.5)\nBy using the Ward identity (2.16), this equation can be written in the form of a Josephson relation for the local chemical potential,\n\u03b4\u00b5\u0303 = \u2202t\u03b4\u03b8v \u2212 \u03c7JJ q2e $1 \u22022\u03b4\u03b8v + $2 qe$1 \u2202t\u03b4a\u0303 , (4.6)\nwhere we have defined the coefficients,\n$1 = sc 4\u03c0 ( \u2206\u03c1(0) )2 , $2 = 2 qe (\u2206%\u2212\u2206%h) = 2 qe (%\u2217 \u2212 %h\u2217) . (4.7)\nIn the last equality we have used that in the normal phase the field theory charge density is equal to the horizon one and therefore %h# = %#. From the above we see that in this notation our Josephson relation (4.6) contains dissipative effects. It is also evident that the amplitude degree of freedom has to enter both the constitutive relations (4.4) as well as the Josephson relation (4.6). The final equation we have left in order to have a complete description is (3.31) which fixed the dynamics of the amplitude. In our notation it reads,\n$1 \u2202t\u03b4a\u0303\u2212 ( 8 \u2206wFE + \u03b3 \u2202i\u2202i ) \u03b4a\u0303\u2212 qe$2 \u2202t\u03b4\u03b8v \u2212 (2 \u2206%\u2212 qe$2) \u03b4\u00b5\u0303 = 0 , (4.8)\nwith \u03b3 as defined in (2.18).

The above relation is easy to show by e.g. using the results of appendix B in [22]. Moreover, in equations (4.11), we have defined the two important quantities,\n\u03bbi = $i\n$21 +$22 , . (4.13)\nWe now need to match the above system of equations to the equations that one would obtain from the phenomenologically motivated equations of the Model F of [24]. In order to do that, we first need to consider the Ginzburg-Landau free energy functional close to the critical point,\nF [\u03c8,m] = \u222b d2x ( w0 2 |\u2207\u03c8| 2 + r\u030302 |\u03c8| 2 + u\u03030|\u03c8|4 + 1 2C0 m2 + \u03b30m |\u03c8|2 ) , (4.14)\n\u2013 17 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 8\nwhere in this notation m is the conserved charge density.

(4.16)\nThe important lesson that we extract from having explicit expressions for these constants from holography is that apart from r\u03030 and m0, the rest remain finite as we approach the critical point. Notably, the dissipative kinetic coefficient \u03930 remains complex as \u03b5 \u2192 0. These observations will play an important role in the next subsection where we discuss the hydrodynamic modes as we approach the critical point from both the normal and the broken phases. It is important to note that the coefficients (4.16) are ultimately fixed by information which is held fixed either due to conservation laws, like the charge density %, or because it is part of the sources in the problem, like the deformation parameter \u03c6s. We have written quantities, like the susceptibilities \u03c7#QQ, \u03c7?QQ and the free energy wFE which are more natural for the grand canonical ensemble. However, these are to be evaluated on states of chemical potential which is specified by the fixed charge density %."

In general, at exactly the critical point the only gapless modes of our system are fluctuations of the charge density and the critical modes of the complex scalar that become gapless. Even though we are at finite charge density, the fact that we are in the probe limit suggests that the charge density fluctuations will decouple from the pressure and the momentum of system leading to a purely diffusive mode. More specifically, in the normal phase the constitutive relations for the fluctuations of the electric current are,\n\u03b4J t = \u03c7#QQ \u03b4\u00b5 , \u03b4J i = \u2212\u03c3d \u2202i\u03b4\u00b5 .

Since we are working in a probe limit, the expectation is that we will recover the regular hydrodynamics of the supercurrent. This should happen after integrating out the amplitude mode which will acquire a large gap. Before doing that we will examine what happens with the modes of our effective theory in the large gap limit. In order to do this we perform a Fourier decomposition of our modes and recast the linearised equations of motion (4.15) in matrix form,\nM (\u03c9, ki)  \u03b4a0\u03b4\u03b8v0 \u03b4%\u03030  = 0 .

Finally, as we will see in subsection 5.4. in more detail, its limiting value agrees with the diffusion constant of (5.6) only in the case of zero charge density. It is nice to see that the modes behave as we would expect them to in our limit.

This is true even in the limit close to the critical point since the constants \u03930 and w0 remain finite. The second mode involves only the order parameter as in order to satisfy the first equation of the system we have to necessarily set the charge density fluctuation equal to zero.

The latter is one of the roots of the cubic polynomial resulting from demanding that (5.7) has non-trivial solutions.\nAs we can observe, sufficiently close to the critical point the Higgs mode interpolates between two regions where it is diffusive, in accordance with the discussion in sections 5.2 and 5.3. In particular, for k much smaller than the gap, the first equation of (5.9) yields for our model: \u03c9H \u2248 \u03c9gap \u2212 0.43374 i k2 and for k much greater than the gap equation (5.17) gives \u03c9H \u2248 \u2212i k2. The authors of [16], working with exactly the same setup, argued that this mode is diffusive with \u03c9 = \u03c9gap\u2212 i k2. As we showed here, this is indeed the correct behaviour but only for values of momentum much larger than the gap.

The latter is the second root of the cubic that also fixed the dispersion relation of the Higgs mode.

For the backgrounds we will set \u00b5 = 0 and we will also choose m2\u03c8 = \u22122, m2\u03c6 = \u22122, \u03b6\u03c8 = 1, \u03b6\u03c6 = 1, \u03bb\u03c8 = 12 , \u03bb\u03c6 = 1 2 and \u03bb\u03c8\u03c6 = \u2212 3 2 . For this choice of parameters we find a second order phase transition with the critical value of the neutral scalar source being \u03c6(s)c \u2248 2.5646887676. An important observation is that for neutral superfluids we have two decoupled sectors, namely (\u03b4bt, \u03b4bx) and (\u03b4\u03c1, \u03b4\u03c6). As one might expect, the first sector will capture the two quasinormal modes with relevant to the Goldstone mode while the second sector will capture the gapped Higgs mode. This is in accordance with the discussion in section 5.4\nIn figure 3 we plot our numerical results for the Higgs mode \u03c9H as a function of k for \u03c6(s)c \u03c6(s)\n= 0.999999519.

The dashed lines on these plots mark the point of collision for the two Goldstone modes at momentum kcT = 0.0212842, as computed from equation (5.24). These plots clearly show that for kkc 1 we can observe the usual second sound modes of superfluids, whereas for kkc 1 these modes become purely diffusive. As we explained in section 5.4 one of these two diffusive modes pairs nicely with the Higgs mode of figure 3\n\u2013 28 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 8\nk T\nIm[\u03c9H] T 5.\u00d710-4 0.001 0.005 0.010 0.050 0.100 -0.00010 -0.00008 -0.00006 -0.00004 -0.00002 0.00000\nFigure 3.

            "text": "In this paper we have analysed the low energy dynamics of holographic superfluids close to their critical point. As part of our analysis, we have constructed an effective theory for the collective degrees of freedom in involved in the problem. For the standard description of superfluids away from the critical point, the hydrodynamic degrees of freedom are captured by the phase of the order parameter and the local chemical potential [10, 11]. Close to the critical point, the amplitude mode driving the transition becomes gapless and has to be included in the description.\n\u2013 29 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 8\nBy using analytic techniques developed in e.g. [20, 21] we have constructed an effective consisting of the conservation law (2.16), the Josephson relation (4.6) and the equation governing the amplitude dynamics (4.8). By performing a change of variables, we managed to show that our system is equivalent to Model F in the classification of Hohenberg and Halperin [24]. This allowed us to give explicit expressions for the various constants that appear in that description including the dissipative kinetic coefficient. With this information in hand, we carried out a somewhat detailed analysis of our modes in different limits for the gap of the Higgs mode. Moreover, given the analytic understanding of the modes in the normal phase, we have revealed interesting discontinuities in their dispersion relations. Our work can be extended in several different directions. An obvious direction would be to enlarge our minimal description to accommodate for the temperature and fluid velocity of the normal component of our system. In order to do this, we would need to move away from the probe limit and include the backreaction of the background metric along with the coupling of the complex scalar one-form field fluctuations with the metric. In such a more complicated scenario our techniques would still produce usable results. In a sense that would our recent analysis [20] would need to be extended with the inclusion of the Higgs mode that we discussed in the present simplifying case."

            "text": "The aim of this appendix is to prove equation (5.10). In order to do this, we remind the reader a couple of facts about the free energy difference between the normal and broken phases \u2206wFE(\u00b5, \u03c6s). Since we don\u2019t vary temperature in our probe model, we have suppressed the dependence on it. The basic property that this function satisfies is that it vanishes on the critical hypersurface (\u00b5c(\u03c6s), \u03c6s),\n\u2206wFE (\u00b5c(\u03c6s), \u03c6s) = 0 . (A.1)\nMoreover, with the transition being second order, the normal derivative with respect to the hypersurface also vanishes. These two statement imply that we indeed have,\n\u2207\u2206wFE (\u00b5c(\u03c6s), \u03c6s) = 0 , (A.2)\nand that the points (\u00b5c(\u03c6s), \u03c6s) are not extrema. This shows that the Hessian matrix of \u2206wFE(\u00b5, \u03c6s) evaluated on the critical surface should only have one non-zero eigenvalue which should also be positive. As a consequence, the determinant of the Hessian should vanish showing the relation,(\n\u03bd?\u00b5 \u2212 \u03bd#\u00b5 )2 = ( \u03bd?\u03c6 \u2212 \u03bd # \u03c6 ) ( \u03c7?QQ \u2212 \u03c7 # QQ ) . (A.3)\n\u2013 30 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 2 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 0 2 8\nUsing this relation, it is then easy to show that,\n\u2206wFE = \u2212 1\n\u03c7?QQ \u2212 \u03c7 # QQ\n(\u2206%)2\n2 , (A.4)\nwhich is equivalent to (5.10) given equation the relation (4.12).\nOpen Access.
