    "abstractText": "In this work, the heat transfer characteristics of supercritical pressure CO2 in vertical heating tube with 10 mm inner diameter under high mass flux were investigated by using an SST k-\u03c9 turbulent model. The influences of inlet temperature, heat flux, mass flux, buoyancy and flow acceleration on the heat transfer of supercritical pressure CO2 were discussed. Our results show that the buoyancy and flow acceleration effect based on single phase fluid assumption fail to explain the current simulation results. Here, supercritical pseudo-boiling theory is introduced to deal with heat transfer of scCO2. scCO2 is treated to have a heterogeneous structure consisting of vapor-like fluid and liquid-like fluid. A physical model of scCO2 heat transfer in vertical heating tube was established containing a gas-like layer near the wall and a liquid-like fluid layer. Detailed distribution of thermophysical properties and turbulence in radial direction show that scCO2 heat transfer is greatly affected by the thickness of gas-like film, thermal properties of gas-like film and turbulent kinetic energy in the near-wall region. Buoyancy parameters Bu < 10\u22125, Bu* < 5.6 \u00d7 10\u22127 and flow acceleration parameter Kv < 3 \u00d7 10\u22126 in this paper, which indicate that buoyancy effect and flow acceleration effect has no influence on heat transfer of scCO2 under high mass fluxes. This work successfully explains the heat transfer mechanism of supercritical fluid under high mass flux.",

Introduction\nAs a basic physical phenomenon, the heat transfer process involves various application areas such as air conditioning refrigeration, heat pumps, thermal power plants, aerospace, electronic chip thermal management system and battery thermal management system. Convective heat transfer plays a significant role in above fields, high performance liquid convection not only enhances heat transfer efficiency but also improves system stability and safety [1,2]. Conventional convection intensification techniques fall into three categories, active method, passive method and compound method [3]. Active techniques include mechanical agitation of heat transfer fluid, vibration of heat transfer surface and vibration of heat transfer fluid. Passive techniques include artificial roughness (ribs and grooves), special shaped tubes, twisted tapes inserts, multiple swirl devices and longitudinal vortex generators. As we all know, convectional heat transfer fluid such as oil, water, ethylene glycol and ethylene glycol mixture possess low thermal conductivity compared to solid metals, which makes these fluids have poor heat transfer performance as a heat transfer medium. Using nanofluid as heat transfer working medium is a new method to enhance heat transfer. Nanofluid, coined by Choi [4], refers to a fluid in which nanometer-sized particles with high thermal conductivity are suspended in conventional heat transfer basic fluids. Recent review articles shows that nanofluids significantly improve the heat transfer capability of conventional heat transfer fluids such as oil or water by suspending nanoparticles in\nEntropy 2022, 24, 79. https://doi.org/10.3390/e24010079 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/entropy\nEntropy 2022, 24, 79 2 of 19\nthese base liquids [5]. In addition to nanofluids, in recent years, liquid metals have rapidly emerged as some of the most attractive coolants for heat transfer enhancement duo to excellent thermophysical properties, including low melting point, high boiling point and high thermal conductivity. Deng et al. [2] systematically reviewed low-melting-point liquid metal convective heat transfer based on gallium-based and bismuth-based alloys from the perspectives of materials, mechanisms and applications. They draw a conclusion, compared with conventional convection technologies, as the most important advantages of liquid metal convective heat transfer are the ultra-high convective heat transfer coefficient, excellent stabilities at high temperatures, and efficient driving by a nonmechanical pump. MXene with a chemical formula of Ti3C2 is synthesized using wet chemistry method and suspended in pure olein palm oil to formulate a new class of heat transfer fluid was numerically investigate by Samylingam et al. [6]. They found that the heat transfer coefficient of MXene nanofluids increased by about 9% compared to Al2O3-water heat transfer fluid. As a natural working fluid, carbon dioxide (CO2) has many advantages, such as environmental friendliness (ozone depleting potential, ODP = 0; effective global warming potential, EGWP = 0), non-toxic, chemically stable, non-combustible and low thermodynamic critical points (critical pressure: 7.38 Mpa, critical temperature: 31.04 \u25e6C). Because of the above excellent physical and chemical properties, supercritical CO2 (scCO2) is regarded as an attractive working fluid for the closed power cycles driven by various heat sources such as solar energy, nuclear energy and coal. In recent years, scCO2 Brayton cycle has drawn a lot of attention in the field of power generation [7,8]. Compared to supercritical water-power cycle, the scCO2 cycles have higher thermal efficiency [9]. In such a system, it is necessary for the heater to receive ultra-high heat flux heated by nuclear energy, solar energy or burning coal [10\u201312]. Considering a solar driven scCO2 power cycle, if the solar receiver is not well cooled by the scCO2 fluid, the solar receiver will be burned out. This phenomenon should be avoided in the design stage. In addition to that, due to the severe change of the thermophysical properties of scCO2 near the pseudo-critical temperature Tpc where the specific heat value reaches its maximum (see Figure 1), which results in the very complex heat transfer characteristics of scCO2. The data in Figure 1 is from the NIST standard database, Refprop 9.0. Therefore, studying the heat transfer characteristics and understanding the heat transfer mechanism of scCO2 is very important to improve system design and ensure system safety for scCO2 cycles.\nEntropy 2022, 24, 79 2 of 19\nfluids.

Ther fore, studying the heat transfer characteristics and underst ding the heat transfer mechanis of scCO2 is very import t to improve system design and ensure system safety for scCO2 cycles.\nPrevious studies have shown that when the supercritical fluid is crossing the pseudo-critical temperature, there are three modes of heat transfer: normal heat transfer (NHT), heat transfer enhancement (HTE) and heat transfer deterioration (HTD). NHT refers to the wall temperature rise monotonously along the tube.

NHT refers to the wall temperature rise monotonously along the tube. HTE is the sudden increase of heat transfer coefficient near Tpc. A sharp wall temperature rise is called HTD. When HTD occurs, it might lead to the heating surface failure because of burning out. Hence, great\nEntropy 2022, 24, 79 3 of 19\nattention has been paid on HTD [13\u201315]. At present, the mechanism of HTD is mainly studied by numerical methods and experiments. A series of experimental and numerical simulation studies on heat transfer characteristics of scCO2 flowing in heated mini-tubes were carried out Jiang\u2019s group [16\u201318]. Jiang et al. [16,17] experimentally and numerically investigated the heat transfer of CO2 at supercritical pressures in a vertical mini tube with diameter of 0.27 mm at relatively low Reynolds numbers for upward and downward flows. They found that the buoyancy effect is weak when the heating is relatively strong, while the flow acceleration effect strongly influences the turbulence and reduces the heat transfer for high heat flux. Li et al. [18] experimentally studied the heat transfer of scCO2 flowing in vertical upward and downward flow with an inner diameter of 2.0 mm, they found that a sharp wall temperature rise occurred in vertical upward flow but was not found in downward flow. Kim et al. [19] conducted an experimental study on heat transfer of scCO2 in vertical upward and downward flow with uniform heating, and, also, found the same results as Li et al. [18]. Kline et al. [20] experimentally studied the convective heat transfer to CO2 flowing in a vertical upward heated tubes at supercritical pressures, the onset of HTD in upward flows was identified for a wide range of conditions, and they found that HTD was observed within a range of inlet temperatures, outside of which the wall temperature behave monotonically increased. Some researchers have found that flow direction also has a great influence on heat transfer of scCO2. They found that a sharp wall temperature rise occurred in vertical upward flow but was not found in downward flow. Zhang et al. [21] performed an experiment to study heat transfer of scCO2 in a 16 mm diameter tube with low mass flux. A special heat transfer behavior was observed, heat transfer at lower mass flux was not deteriorated but rather enhanced with a rising heat transfer coefficient. They suggested that this phenomenon was possibly induced by the combined effects of strong buoyancy effect and high specific heat of the fluid. As a continuity of their experiments, Zhang et al. [22] performed numerical works to explore the mechanisms behind different heat transfer behaviors of scCO2. The V2F model is recommended to predict heat transfer behaviors of sCO2 at low mass flux. For normal mass flux cases, the SST k-\u03c9 model can well capture the heat transfer deterioration and recovery. Fan et al. [23] numerically investigated the heat transfer of scCO2 inside the upward circular tube near the pseudo-critical region with non-uniform heating vertical tubes, they found that HTD is more likely to be induced by local thickening of the viscous sublayer. Meanwhile, when heat flux and mass flux are both high, the existing buoyancy criterions are no longer applicable. Our literature survey showed that supercritical fluid has been regarded as homogeneous structure. Based on single-phase assumption of supercritical fluid, a large number of studies have attributed the mechanism of HTD in supercritical fluids to buoyancy and flow acceleration effect. However, the inconsistent results or even opposite results could be found in the existing literature [24,25]. The criterion number of the onset of buoyancy and flow acceleration effect is only suitable for their own experimental conditions and not widely applicable. Hence, using single-phase assumption to analyze supercritical heat transfer is facing great challenges. In recent years, the cognition of single-phase of supercritical fluid is questioned by physicists. Recent studies have shown that the supercritical fluid has a heterogeneous structure, a Widom line (WL) separates the supercritical fluid into a liquid-like region and a gas-like region (see Figure 2) [26\u201328]. Banuti [29] proved the existence of supercritical pseudo-boiling when crossing the Widom-line, he argued that the supercritical pseudo-boiling does not occur in a phase equilibrium but takes place over a finite temperature interval (T\u2212 and T+), where T\u2212 is less than Tpc and T+ is greater than Tpc. In other words, the bulk fluid temperature below T\u2212 is a liquid-like fluid, beyond T+ is a gas-like fluid. The pseudo-boiling enthalpy \u2206i at supercritical pressure consists of latent heat \u2206ilat and sensible heat \u2206isen, the former is used to overcome intermolecular attraction for phase transition, and the latter is used to raise the temperature. Recent experimental studies and molecular dynamics simulations confirm Banuti\u2019s theoretical analysis [30,31].\nEntropy 2022, 24, 79 4 of 19tro 2022, 24, 79\nBanuti [29] proved the existence of supercritical pseudo-boiling when crossing the Widom-line, he argued that the supercritical pseudo-boiling does not occur in a phase equilibrium but takes place over a finite temperature interval (T\u2212 and T+), where T\u2212 is less than Tpc and T+ is greater than Tpc.

Thus, the objective of this work is to numerically study the heat transfer behaviors of scCO2 under high mass flux, to discuss the effects of various parameters on heat transfer, and to understand the mechanisms based on pseudo-boiling theory. A physical model of scCO2 heat transfer in vertical heating tube was established containing a gas-like layer near the wall and a liquid-like fluid layer, the two regions are interfaced at T = T+. Detailed distribution of thermophysical properties and turbulence in radial direction showed that supercritical heat transfer is greatly affected by the thickness of gas-like film, thermal properties of gas-like film and turbulent kinetic energy in the near-wall region. The low thermal conductivity of the gas-like layer resulting in large thermal resistance and the reduction of turbulent kinetic energy near the wall are the main reasons for the weakening of heat transfer and the occurrence of sharp rise of the wall temperature or heat transfer deterioration (HTD).

Physical Model\nThe simulating physical model of vertically upward circular tube with 10 mm inner diameter in present study is established as shown in Figure 3. The calculation domain consists of inlet adiabatic section, heating section and outlet adiabatic section. The length of the inlet adiabatic section is 500 mm to ensure the CO2 at the inlet of the heating section fully developed. The effective heating length of the tube is 2000 mm, which is the main section of studying the heat transfer characteristics of scCO2. The outlet adiabatic section (300 mm) is provided to prevent reverse flow phenomenon. The flow direction is along the positive direction of z-axis. The direction of gravity is opposite to the flow direction. Entropy 2022, 24, 79 5 of 19\nFigure 3. The physical model of vertically upward tube in present study.\n2.2.

Due to the low thermal conductivity of the gas-like phase, the thick gas-like layer results in large thermal resistance, which will severely inhibit heat diffusion from the tube wall to the core flow and, finally, causes sharp rise of wall temperature or HTD, which is similar to film boiling at subcritical pressure. However, when the inlet temperature is higher than the pseudo-critical temperature, the bulk fluid is pure gas-like fluid, the heat transfer characteristic accords with the single-phase convective heat transfer, thus, the wall temperature rises monotonously along the bulk fluid enthalpy.

In case of higher heat flux (400 kW/m2), the wall temperature had a noticeable peak, and the peak point moves towards the lower bulk fluid enthalpy region. We also observed that for the high heat flux the wall temperature reach a constant value after the peak, this is because, when the bulk fluid temperature is greater than the pseudo-critical temperature, the bulk fluid is pure gas-like fluid, and its heat transfer mechanism is single-phase convective heat transfer, so the wall temperature shows a smooth increase.

In each panel, the radial position of T+ is also marked, the gas-like film thickness \u03b4 is defined as the distance from the radial position of T+ to the tube inner wall. As can be seen from the Figure 11, the thickness of gas-like film at characteristic cross section D is greater than that at characteristic cross section E\u2032, the thickness of gas-like film at characteristic cross section E is much larger than that at characteristic cross E\u2032, that is to say, the thickness of gas-like film increases with the increase of heat flux. The thermal conductivity of gas-like layer generally is very low (see Figure 11a), close to the thermal conductivity of air, which results in a large thermal resistance, thus, the heat transfer is impaired. Figure 11b shows the distributions of specific heat at different characteristic cross section, the specific heat at characteristic cross sections D and E in the near wall region is less than that at characteristic cross sections D\u2032 and E\u2032 (see Figure 11b), indicating the heat absorption capacity of the gas-like film is also weak, which is also detrimental to heat transfer. Figure 11c shows the radial temperature distribution, the temperature near the wall is the highest, and the temperature gradient in the near wall region is larger than that in the core flow region.

The reasons for higher mass flux can eliminate HTD and improve heat transfer will be explained. The working conditions of mass flux G = 1500 kg/m2s and G = 2500 kg/m2s were selected for analysis. For the convenience of discussion, the characteristic cross section F, G and F\u2032, G\u2032 were selected to analysis the different heat transfer behavior resulting from different mass fluxes, as shown in Figure 12. Figure 13 illustrates the detailed distributions of thermophysical properties and turbulence in radial direction at above characteristic cross section F, G and F\u2032, G\u2032. In each panel, the gas-like film thickness \u03b4 is also marked. It can be seen from Figure 13, in general, the thickness of gas-like film decreases with the increase of mass flux. The thickness of gas-like film at the cross-section G corresponding to the wall temperature peak is the largest. Becau e of the low thermal conductivity of the gas-like film and the low heat absorption capacity of the gas-like film near the wall (see Figure 11a,b), therefore, heat transfer is weakened at the characteristic section G. Figure 13c shows the distribution of density in radial direction. We can see that the near-wall zone is occupied by gas-like fluid, and the liquid-like fluid is in the core flow region. Except for the thickness\nEntropy 2022, 24, 79 13 of 19\nand thermal properties of gas-like film, the turbulent kinetic energy near the wall, also, has a great influence on heat transfer.

Conclusions\nThe heat transfer behaviors of supercritical pressure CO2 in vertical heating tube under high mass flux were investigated using the SST k-\u03c9 turbulent model, the influences of inlet temperature, heat flux, mass flux, buoyancy and flow acceleration on the heat transfer of supercritical pressure CO2 were discussed. The main results are summarized as follows: \u2022 The occurrence of HTD is closely related to inlet temperature. When inlet temperature is less than pseudo-critical temperature, a prominent temperature peak was observed ahead of the pseudo-critical point. However, the wall temperature increases monotonously when inlet temperature is greater than pseudo-critical temperature. The wall temperature increases as the heat flux increases, and the HTD occurs at high heat flux. Increasing mass flux can enhance heat transfer and even eliminate heat transfer deterioration. At P = 8 Mpa and G = 1500 kg/m2s, when the heat fluxes doubled, the average wall temperature increased by 3.82 times, however, when the mass flux increases 1.6 times, the average wall temperature decreases 2.57 times. \u2022 At high mass flux, our results show that the buoyancy criterion number Bu < 10\u22125 and Bu* < 5.6 \u00d7 10\u22127, they are both all less than their critical value in the whole enthalpy region, and flow acceleration criterion number Kv also is less than their critical value 3.6 \u00d7 10\u22126 in the whole enthalpy region, indicating the influences of buoyancy and flow acceleration on supercritical heat transfer can be neglected. Thus, the mechanism of supercritical heat transfer at high mass flux cannot be explained by buoyancy and flow acceleration effect. \u2022 Supercritical pseudo-boiling is used to do with the heat transfer of scCO2. A physical model of scCO2 heat transfer in vertical heating tube was established containing a gas-like layer near the wall and a liquid-like fluid layer, the two domains are interfaced at T = T+. Due to the low thermal conductivity of the gas-like phase, the thick gaslike layer results in large thermal resistance, and, finally, causes sharp rise of wall temperature or HTD. Further analysis found supercritical heat transfer is extremely affected by the thickness of gas-like film, thermal properties of gas-like film and turbulent kinetic energy in the near-wall region.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, B.Z. and K.G.; methodology, B.Z., K.G., B.P., J.H.; software, K.G. and J.H.; validation, K.G. and J.H.; formal analysis, K.G. and J.H.; investigation, B.Z. and K.G.; resources, B.P.; data curation, K.G.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, K.G. and B.P.; writing\u2014 review and editing, B.Z.; visualization, B.Z.; supervision, B.Z.; project administration, B.P.; All authors have read and agreed to the published version of the manuscript.\nFunding: The study was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51966009).\nInstitutional Review Board Statement: Not applicable.\nInformed Consent Statement: Not applicable.\nData Availability Statement: Not applicable.\nAcknowledgments: We appreciate the support from the National Natural Science Foundation of China (51966009).\nConflicts of Interest: The authors declared that there is no conflict of interest.\nNomenclature\nKv flow acceleration parameter Bu buoyancy parameter Bu* new buoyancy parameter A area of the tube across-section, m2 \u2202 partial differential d first order differential\nEntropy 2022, 24, 79 17 of 19\nFb buoyancy force,N x tiny cell Prt turbulent prandtl number \u03c3 s The distance between T\u2212 and T+, mm cp specific heat, kJ/kg\u00b7K din inner diameter of the tube, m G mass flux, kg/m2s Gr Grashof number Gr* new grashof number h heat transfer coefficient, kW/m2K i enthalpy, kJ/kg Nu nusselt number P pressure, MPa Pr prandtl number q heat flux, kW/m2 Re Reynolds number T temperature, \u25e6C T\u2212 the starting temperature of pseudo-boiling, \u25e6C T+ the ending temperature of pseudo-boiling, \u25e6C \u2206ilat latent heat,oC \u2206isen sensible heat,oC \u2206i Pseudo-boiling enthalpy,kJ/kg Gk turbulence production term Yk dissipation term of turbulent kinetic energy k due to turbulence G\u03c9 generation term of specific dissipation rate Y\u03c9 dissipation term of specific dissipation rate D\u03c9 cross diffusion term cp,pc specific heat capacity and enthalpy at pseudo-critical point, kJ/kg\u00b7K ipc enthalpy at pseudo-critical point, J/kg Greek symbols \u03b2 thermal expansion coefficient, 1/K \u03bb heat conductivity coefficient, W/mK \u00b5 dynamic viscosity, Pa\u00b7s k turbulent kinetic energy, m2/s2 \u03c9 specific dissipation rate \u03b4 gas-like film thickness,mm \u03c4 shear stress \u03b4+ boundary layer thickness \u03c1 density, kg/m3 g acceleration of gravity, m/s2 \u03bd kinematic viscosity, m2/s Subscripts ave average b bulk fluid exp experiment in inlet out outlet pc pseudo-critical w inner wall c critical point fg saturation vapor-liquid in inlet i y direction j z direction\nEntropy 2022, 24, 79 18 of 19\nReferences 1.
