"In order to strengthen the evidence-base for this field, systematic pre-/post-AAD assessments employing validated instruments are warranted." 

"Finally, the use of biological measures when possible may provide key objective insights into the long-term effects of having an AAD." 

"limitations While findings from this investigation provide significant support for the benefits of AADs, the data are limited in a number of ways." 

"Overall, considering the heterogeneity of our participant families, we are reasonably confident that receiving an AAD, the one consistent change for all families during the study collection period, was a driving factor in positive outcomes." 

"conclusions To our knowledge, the present study is the first to examine psychosocial and biobehavioral effects of assistance dogs trained specifically for ASD using validated and standardized measures of family experience, parental stress, autism symptom severity, and child behavior; these data are also the first to evaluate a biological marker for chronic stress in both children and parents/caregivers."
