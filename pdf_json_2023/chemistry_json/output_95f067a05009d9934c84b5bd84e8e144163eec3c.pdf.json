    "abstractText": "Water electrolysis represented a promising avenue for the large-scale production of highpurity hydrogen. However, the high overpotential and sluggish reaction rates associated with the anodic oxygen evolution reaction (OER) posed significant obstacles to efficient water splitting. To tackle these challenges, the urea oxidation reaction (UOR) emerged as a more favorable thermodynamic alternative to OER, offering both the energy-efficient hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the potential for the treating of urea-rich wastewater. In this work, a two-step methodology comprising nanowire growth and phosphating treatment was employed to fabricate Cu3P nanowires on Cu foam (Cu3P-NW/CF) catalysts. These novel catalytic architectures exhibited notable efficiencies in facilitating both the UOR and HER in alkaline solutions. Specifically, within urea-containing electrolytes, the UOR manifested desirable operational potentials of 1.43 V and 1.65 V versus the reversible hydrogen electrode (vs. RHE) to reach the current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm\u22122, respectively. Concurrently, the catalyst displayed a meager overpotential of 60 mV for the HER at a current density of 10 mA cm\u22122. Remarkably, the two-electrode urea electrolysis system, exploiting the designed catalyst as both the cathode and anode, demonstrated an outstanding performance, attaining a low cell voltage of 1.79 V to achieve a current density of 100 mA cm\u22122. Importantly, this voltage is preferable to the conventional water electrolysis threshold in the absence of urea molecules. Moreover, our study shed light on the potential of innovative Cu-based materials for the scalable fabrication of electrocatalysts, energy-efficient hydrogen generation, and the treatment of urea-rich wastewater.",

            "text": "The rapid proliferation of the global population, and the advancement of civilization have engendered an exponential escalation in energy demand [1,2], while fossil fuels as a predominant stakeholder in the energy sector have exacerbated a myriad of predicaments, including energy insufficiencies [3], environmental calamities [4], climate change [5], and human health issues [6]. These formidable challenges have underscored the imperative to foster renewable energy alternatives, which have been exemplified by solar power [7], wind energy [8], hydrogen [9], and other viable options. Among these alternatives, hydrogen energy exhibited exceptional promise owing to its elevated calorific value and negligible ecological footprint [10]. However, the anodic OER used in existing technology consumed a great deal of energy due to its sluggish kinetics and high overpotential [11,12]. Researchers have been seeking more favorable anodic reactions, e.g., small molecules oxidation (urea, hydrazine, alcohol, aldehyde, amine, and glucose, etc.), to replace the OER and improve the efficiency of hydrogen production [13]. Among them, one promising option is the UOR, which has an ideal theoretical thermodynamic voltage of just 0.37 V, which is considerably\nMaterials 2023, 16, 4169. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma16114169 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2023, 16, 4169 2 of 12\nlower than the OER\u2019s value of 1.23 V [14,15], indicating its potential in the purification of urea-containing wastewater as well as low energy consumption for hydrogen production. Noble metals such as Pt, Ir, and Ru have gained recognition for their exceptional performance in UOR [16,17]. Nevertheless, their elevated cost and limited accessibility have imposed restrictions on their practical implementation. To tackle this predicament, extensive endeavors have been directed towards the development of non-precious transition metal-based catalysts for the UOR, which have exhibited both cost-effectiveness and comparable activities to their costly counterparts. Recently, there has been burgeoning interest in Ni-/Co-based materials, encompassing Sn-CoS2 [18], Ni-Mo-S [19], Co2Mo3O8 [20], NiCo2O4 [21], and Fe-Ni(OH)2 [22], respectively, owing to their potential in bolstering the UOR. However, the exploration of Cu-based catalysts for the UOR remains in its nascent stages. For instance, Lian et al. adeptly synthesized Cu(OH)2 catalysts, unveiling their remarkable performance in UORs with a potential of 1.49 V vs. RHE at 10 mA cm\u22122 [23]. In a separate investigation, Yang et al. embellished CuO nanosheets with Ni(OH)2 nanoparticles, attaining a current density of 10 mA cm\u22122 at a potential of 1.41 V vs. RHE [24]. Despite these substantial advancements, it is worth emphasizing that UOR electrocatalysts based on Cu3P have not been reported yet. Moreover, prior studies have illustrated the potential of Cu3P-based electrodes, including crystalline Cu3P phosphide nanosheets [25], hierarchical Fe(PO3)2@Cu3P nanotube arrays [26], and Cu3P weaving mesh [27], as the captivating materials for electrocatalytic HER. Consequently, the pursuit of a Cu3P-assisted UOR system for hydrogen production holds an immense research value. Numerous reported catalysts for the UOR and the HER have encountered challenges associated with an inadequate electroconductivity, deficient specific surface area, and restricted activity. To address these issues, a novel strategy was employed in this investigation involving the synthesis of the Cu3P-NW/CF catalyst. The resulting Cu3P-NW/CF catalyst was subsequently evaluated for its performance in an alkaline medium for both the UOR and the HER. Benefiting from the three-dimensional network structure electrode resembling a honeycomb provided by copper foam, it has since become a widely adopted substrate. The Cu3P-NW/CF catalyst exhibited an enhanced conductivity and a greater quantity of active sites. Consequently, it displayed working potentials of 1.43 V and \u22120.06 V vs. RHE to yield a current density of 10 mA cm\u22122 for the UOR and the HER, respectively. These values were found to be close to or even better than those of previously reported catalysts. Furthermore, the catalyst demonstrated low Tafel slopes for both the UOR and the HER, indicative of favorable reaction kinetics. Of utmost significance, when utilized as both the anode and cathode in a double-electrode urea electrolyzer, the Cu3P-NW/CF catalyst exhibited an excellent stability and necessitated a low cell voltage of 1.79 V to attain a current density of 100 mA cm\u22122. This promising performance serves to expand the potential application of Cu-based materials in the UOR."

The unique architecture of the Cu3P-NW/CF electrode not only provided an abundance of active sites [37], but also facilitated the efficient transport of electrons and ions at the electrode\u2013electrolyte interface [38].\nBased on the widely used double layer capacitance (Cdl) test, these samples\u2019 electrochemical active surface areas (ECSA) were also assessed since a positive correlation was found to exist between them [39,40]. As depicted in Figure 3c, the Cu3P-NW/CF electrode had a Cdl value of 7.5 mF cm\u22122, which was approximately 1.4 times higher than the value of the Cu3P-P/CF electrode (5.3 mF cm\u22122). These results suggest that the construction of the self-supported nanowire arrays through an in situ method can effectively improve the catalyst\u2019s active area [41], accelerate the diffusion of electrolytes [42], and promote the release of gaseous product bubbles from the active sites [43]. Moreover, the EIS was\nMaterials 2023, 16, 4169 7 of 12\ntested to further investigate the charge-transfer kinetic features of the Cu3P-NW/CF and Cu3P-P/CF electrodes. Figure 3d revealed that the Cu3P-NW/CF electrode had a smaller solution resistance and ion diffusion resistance compared to the Cu3P-P/CF electrode, demonstrating its fast reaction kinetics and contributing to its excellent UOR activity. The chronoamperometry method provided compelling evidence of the excellent stability and durability of Cu3P-NW/CF in alkaline electrolytes comprising 1.0 M KOH + 0.33 M urea. As shown in Figure 3e, there is an almost imperceptible attenuation for the current density of ~77 mA cm\u22122 after 30 h continuous operation at 1.6 V vs. RHE. The SEM images captured before and after the stability tests indicated no discernible alterations in the structure and morphology of the nanowire arrays (Figure S9), further substantiating their remarkable robustness. The HER capability of the Cu3P-NW/CF electrode was further evaluated in a 1.0 M KOH aqueous solution and compared with the Cu3P-P/CF electrode and Pt/C under identical conditions (Figure 4a). Undoubtedly, within the examined voltage window, the cathode current of individual CF was found to be virtually nonexistent in contrast to the benchmark Pt/C, which demonstrated the highest activity. At universal current densities of \u221210 and \u2212100 mA cm\u22122, the Cu3P-NW/CF exhibited exceptional catalytic activity, demanding low overpotentials of 60 and 389 mV, respectively. Conversely, at the equivalent current densities, the Cu3P-P/CF electrode was capable of acquiring high overpotentials of 170 and 583 mV, respectively (Figure 4b).

In comparison, the Cu3P-P/CF powder-based electrode exhibited comparatively sluggish kinetics due to its detrimental structural characteristics that alleviated the HER on the catalyst surface [44]. The HER process at Cu3P-NW/CF followed a Volmer\u2013Heyrovsky mechanism [45,46], with the electrochemical desorption of adsorbed hydrogen being considered as the rate-determining step [47,48]. To assess durability, a chronoamperometric test was conducted at overpotentials of \u22120.7 V vs. RHE for 30 h.

A two-electrode urea-assisted electrolyzer was assembled, using both the working electrode and the counter electrode consisting of Cu3P-NW/CF. Figure 5a showed that, in contrast to the Cu3P-P/CF electrode (1.56 V and 2.01 V), the Cu3P-NW/CF electrode required unusually lower operating potentials of 1.50 and 1.79 V to easily attain current densities of 10 and 100 mA cm\u22122, respectively.

(b) Stability test of the Cu3P-NW/CF catalyst for urea electrolysis.\nThe outstanding durability and activity of the Cu3P-NW/CF catalyst can be attributed to several factors elucidated by the aforementioned findings. First, the method utilized for growing ordered nanowire arrays in situ on CF does not require the addition of binders, thereby enhancing its stability as well as the electron transfer ability across the catalyst and the substrate in an electrochemical process. This binder-free configuration ensures robustness and mitigates the possibility of performance degradation over time. Furthermore, the unique structure of the Cu3P nanowire arrays provides a higher density of active sites, thereby enabling enhanced catalytic activity. At the same time, the nanowire architecture facilitates the efficient removal of generated gases through its outermost layer, preventing gas bubble accumulation and reducing mass transport limitations. This advantageous feature distinguishes the Cu3P-NW/CF catalyst from the conventional powder catalysts with flat surfaces, leading to improved catalytic performances and increased reaction efficiency. These combined attributes of the Cu3P-NW/CF catalyst, including its binder-free construction, high surface area, and efficient gas removal mechanism, contribute to its exceptional durability and activity in the urea electrochemical oxidation and hydrogen generation processes."

Furthermore, the unique structure of the C 3P nanowire arrays provid s a higher density of active sites,\nMaterials 2023, 16, 4169 9 of 12\nthereby enabling enhanced catalytic activity. At the same time, the nanowire architecture facilitates the efficient removal of generated gases through its outermost layer, preventing gas bubble accumulation and reducing mass transport limitations. This advantageous feature distinguishes the Cu3P-NW/CF catalyst from the conventional powder catalysts with flat surfaces, leading to improved catalytic performances and increased reaction efficiency. These combined attributes of the Cu3P-NW/CF catalyst, including its binder-free construction, high surface area, and efficient gas removal mechanism, contribute to its exceptional durability and activity in the urea electrochemical oxidation and hydrogen generation processes."

            "text": "In summary, a Cu3P nanowire array was synthesized using a simple two-step methodology. The resulting catalyst demonstrated exceptional catalytic prowess for the UOR and the HER owing to the heightened conductivity and augmented active sites. Of particular significance, a urea-assisted electrolysis system employing dual Cu3P-NW/CF electrodes achieved a current density of 100 mA cm\u22122 with an impressively low applied voltage of 1.79 V, surpassing both the comparative sample and the conventional alkaline water electrolyzer. This configuration holds considerable potential for energy-efficient hydrogen production. This investigation unveils an innovative approach for the intelligent fabrication and modification of Cu-based electrocatalysts, highlighting a specific focus on hydrogen generation and other energy-related applications. Moreover, the cost-effective and highly catalytic Cu3P-NW/CF bifunctional electrocatalyst not only facilitates the ecologically sound treatment of urea-containing wastewater, but also enables the development of lowpressure, high-efficiency hybrid water electrolysis systems. Furthermore, it engenders numerous prospects for advancing Cu-based catalysts in the realm of electrochemistry, encompassing oxygen reduction, CO2 reduction, and oxidation reactions involving other diminutive molecules.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ma16114169/s1, Figure S1.
