Similarly, marked changes in the cardiovascular system from sleep loss and stress include an increased risk for cardiovascular disease. It remains unknown whether key hemodynamic markers, including left ventricular ejection time (LVET), stroke volume (SV), heart rate (HR), cardiac index (CI), blood pressure (BP), and systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI), differ in resilient vs. vulnerable individuals and predict differential performance resilience with sleep loss and stress. We investigated for the first time whether the combination of total sleep deprivation (TSD) and psychological stress affected a comprehensive set of hemodynamic measures in healthy adults, and whether these measures differentiated neurobehavioral performance in resilient and vulnerable individuals. Thirty-two healthy adults (ages 27\u201353; 14 females) participated in a 5-day experiment in the Human Exploration Research Analog (HERA), a high-fidelity National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) space analog isolation facility, consisting of two baseline nights, 39 h TSD, and two recovery nights. A modified Trier Social Stress Test induced psychological stress during TSD. Cardiovascular measure collection [SV, HR, CI, LVET, BP, and SVRI] and neurobehavioral performance testing (including a behavioral attention task and a rating of subjective sleepiness) occurred at six and 11 timepoints, respectively. Individuals with longer pre-study LVET (determined by a median split on pre-study LVET) tended to have poorer performance during TSD and stress. Resilient and vulnerable groups (determined by a median split on average TSD performance) showed significantly different profiles of SV, HR, CI, and\nFrontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org 1 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 795321\nLVET. Importantly, LVET at pre-study, but not other hemodynamic measures, reliably differentiated neurobehavioral performance during TSD and stress, and therefore may be a biomarker. Future studies should investigate whether the non-invasive marker, LVET, determines risk for adverse health outcomes.\nKeywords: hemodynamics, sleep deprivation, psychological stress, neurobehavioral performance, Karolinska Sleepiness Scale, biomarkers, echocardiography, Psychomotor Vigilance Test"

            "text": "Chronic sleep deprivation is a significant public health issue and is associated with multiple adverse health risks such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, cancer, and overall morbidity and mortality (Ferrie et al., 2007; Gallicchio and Kalesan, 2009; Mullington et al., 2009). For many individuals, sleep loss increases self-rated sleepiness and deficits in sustained attention (Banks and Dinges, 2007; Goel et al., 2009; Brieva et al., 2021; Casale et al., 2021; Yamazaki et al., 2021a,b). However, large, highly replicable, phenotypic individual differences occur in response to sleep deprivation, whereby some individuals are vulnerable, and others are resilient to sleep loss (Van Dongen et al., 2004; Goel, 2017; Yamazaki and Goel, 2020; Brieva et al., 2021; Casale et al., 2021; Yamazaki et al., 2021a,b). These interindividual differences are robust for common types of sleep loss, such as total sleep deprivation (TSD) and chronic sleep restriction (SR) (Dennis et al., 2017; Yamazaki and Goel, 2020), persisting across months and years (Dennis et al., 2017), but do not differ between various subgroups, such as age, sex, race, and body mass index (Yamazaki and Goel, 2020).\nThe sleep and circadian systems are tightly integrated with\u2014 and can markedly affect\u2014the cardiovascular (CV) system. CV variables such as stroke volume (SV), heart rate (HR), cardiac output, blood pressure (BP), left ventricular ejection time (LVET), and vascular resistance all display diurnal variations (Cugini et al., 1993; Morris et al., 2013; Thosar et al., 2018). During non-rapid eye movement (non-REM) sleep, HR and BP decrease from greater parasympathetic activity, while during REM sleep, there is a shift toward greater sympathetic activity; moreover, sleep loss results in less parasympathetic and greater sympathetic activity (Kato et al., 2000; Henelius et al., 2014; Tobaldini et al., 2017). During TSD and SR, CV measures such as SV (L\u00fc et al., 2018), HR (Kato et al., 2000; Meier-Ewert et al., 2004; Zhong et al., 2005; Sauvet et al., 2010; Sunbul et al., 2014; L\u00fc et al., 2018; Bourdillon et al., 2021), cardiac index (CI) (Sunbul et al., 2014), BP (Kato et al., 2000; Muenter et al., 2000; MeierEwert et al., 2004; Zhong et al., 2005; Mullington et al., 2009; Sauvet et al., 2010; L\u00fc et al., 2018; Bourdillon et al., 2021; Bozer et al., 2021; Cernych et al., 2021), and vascular resistance (Kato et al., 2000; L\u00fc et al., 2018) have shown inconsistent changes, with some studies reporting alterations, while others show no changes. To our knowledge, no prior study has examined changes in LVET during sleep deprivation. LVET is strongly positively correlated with SV in healthy participants and is altered in patients with cardiovascular disorders (CVD), such as heart failure (Reant et al., 2010). Heart failure patients show disrupted sleep and are at high risk for obstructive sleep apnea syndromes (Pak et al., 2019).\nSimilarly, both acute and prolonged stress alter CV measures and increase risk for CVD, such as hypertension and coronary artery calcification (Turner et al., 2020). The Trier Social Stress Test (TSST) (Kirschbaum et al., 1993) is a well-validated acute psychological stressor that decreases SV and LVET and increases HR, cardiac output, BP, and vascular resistance (Allen et al., 2014; Jayasinghe et al., 2017). Notably, the combination of sleep loss and various stress conditions also increases BP (Kato et al., 2000; Bozer et al., 2021). To our knowledge, the time course of changes in SV, HR, CI, LVET, BP, and systemic vascular resistance index (SVRI) across sleep loss and psychological stress has not thus far been investigated.\nGiven the synergistic effects of sleep loss and stress on the CV system, CV measures are potential novel candidate biomarkers that have not yet been investigated to identify individuals who are resilient or vulnerable to these potent stressors. We determined whether the combination of sleep loss and psychological stress affects a comprehensive set of CV measures and whether these measures differentiate vulnerable and resilient individuals before and in response to TSD and stress, which is particularly important to consider in applied settings, where both are commonly experienced (Barger et al., 2014; Cromwell et al., 2021; Mhatre et al., 2021). We hypothesized the following: (1) TSD and stress would impair neurobehavioral performance; (2) CV measures at pre-study would identify individual differences in response to TSD and stress; (3) TSD and stress would alter CV measures; and (4) resilient and vulnerable individuals would show differential patterns of change in CV measures."

Two-dimensional images of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) were collected from each participant using a 5S-RS transducer. The LVOT was imaged from the parasternal long-axis view while the participants were semi-supine in a left lateral decubitus posture. Three to four, two-second cine-loops of dynamic motion of the LVOT were digitally saved. SV was collected utilizing a continuous wave (CW) pencil (Pedof) probe for Doppler interrogation. CW Doppler signals were taken from the ascending aorta at the suprasternal notch in a seated posture. Three 5-s cine-loop sweeps of CW Doppler data were collected and digitally stored as proprietary raw data.\nAnalysis of the digital data was conducted using Echo PAC PC (BT12) software (General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI, United States). LVOT diameters were measured just proximal to the aortic valve leaflet insertion from three consecutive cine-loops at the maximum opening of the aortic valve. Five consecutive CW Doppler waveform profiles were traced to calculate the velocity time integral (VTI). The interval between each maximum peak on the Doppler spectral from the ascending aorta was used to calculate the peak-to-peak time in milliseconds (ms). This peak-to-peak time was used as a surrogate to the R\u2013R interval to calculate HR. The duration of each beat was measured to determine LVET for each SV. The VTI and LVET\nwere then transferred from the Echo PAC software to Excel to calculate SV, HR, and CI using the following formulas:\nSV = (LVOT cross sectional area)\u2217VTI HR = 60/(R\u2212R interval)\nCI = [(SV\u2217HR)/1,000]/body surface area"

We dichotomized participants as such, since for initial examination and categorization of novel biomarkers, it is more suitable and applicable to create resilient and vulnerable groups (Chuah et al., 2009; Rocklage et al., 2009; Chee and Tan, 2010; Diekelmann et al., 2010; Patanaik et al., 2015; Yeo et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2016; Moreno-Villanueva et al., 2018; Caldwell et al., 2020; Salfi et al., 2020; Brieva et al., 2021; Casale et al., 2021; Yamazaki et al., 2021b), especially given our sample size. Systematic examination of various approaches and thresholds for assessing differential neurobehavioral vulnerability to sleep loss has also shown that median splits on averaged performance scores, rather than change from baseline or variance in scores, are consistent indicators of resilience and vulnerability during both sleep-deprived and well-rested periods (Brieva et al., 2021; Casale et al., 2021; Yamazaki et al., 2021b), thus further justifying our methods. Table 2 depicts each participant\u2019s resilient or vulnerable status for PVT performance and for KSS scores."

Post hoc one-way ANOVAs assessed performance differences between pre-study groups at each condition when a significant interaction or group effect was detected (e.g., PVT performance at baseline in the short pre-study LVET group vs. PVT performance at baseline in the long pre-study LVET group). Spearman\u2019s relative rank correlation assessed the relationship between average PVT and KSS responses during TSD.\nA median split on average PVT performance and on average KSS scores during TSD and stress determined resilient and vulnerable groups (Patanaik et al., 2015; Moreno-Villanueva et al., 2018; Caldwell et al., 2020).

            "text": "Pre-study LVET differentiated individuals who were resilient or vulnerable during sleep loss and psychosocial stress, whereby individuals with shorter LVET at pre-study had better psychomotor vigilant attention performance during the combination of TSD and psychosocial stress than individuals with longer LVET at pre-study. Moreover, resilient individuals had significantly greater pre-study HR and shorter pre-study LVET than vulnerable individuals. Resilient individuals also had greater SV and CI from baseline through recovery than vulnerable individuals. We show for the first time that LVET differentiates neurobehavioral performance resiliency and vulnerability during TSD and psychological stress. LVET warrants further investigation as a possible biomarker.\nFor the first time, we show that individuals who had short and long pre-study LVET showed differential changes in these measures across the experiment, evinced by a significant time\u2217pre-study group interaction (Figure 2A). These novel results are parallel to\u2014and thus validate\u2014our finding that the PVT resilient group had significantly shorter LVET at prestudy and post-study than the PVT vulnerable group. The PVT resilient group also had significantly greater HR at pre-study than the PVT vulnerable group. Since LVET is a valid identifier of performance resilience and vulnerability, it may be a key target for identifying and mitigating the numerous negative repercussions of decrements induced by sleep loss and stress (Van Dongen et al., 2006; Howard et al., 2014).\nCardiac index and SVRI did not significantly change with TSD and psychological stress, consistent with prior studies (Kato et al., 2000; L\u00fc et al., 2018). However, seated SV, HR, LVET, and BP all significantly changed with sleep loss and psychological stress as has been shown in some studies (Kato et al., 2000; Meier-Ewert et al., 2004; Zhong et al., 2005; Sauvet et al., 2010; Sunbul et al., 2014; L\u00fc et al., 2018; Bourdillon et al., 2021; Bozer et al., 2021; Cernych et al., 2021), but not others (Kato et al., 2000; Sauvet et al., 2010; Bourdillon et al., 2021; Bozer et al., 2021). Discrepancies in study findings may be due to differences in the severity of TSD and/or stress conditions or in hemodynamic collection methods such as the angle dependency of Doppler. However, R\u2013R timing measures derived from Doppler are independent of angle correction and similar to direct R\u2013R interval measures derived from electrocardiography or applanation tonometry.\nNotably, standing SV, HR, CI, and LVET were also measured 3 min after the seated measures but were not reported in the main results. SV, LVET, and BP were all lower than their respective seated measures, an expected finding considering volume shifts in participants who had been fasting. Inversely, HR increased as a compensatory mechanism to adequate perfusion, thus\ndecreasing R\u2013R interval (Klabunde, 2012). Additionally, with a few minor exceptions, there were no significant differences in changes from seated to standing measures at any condition between the resilient and vulnerable groups, reflecting the fact that all participants were at equivalent baseline volume status. The differences between the vulnerable and resilient groups can thus be attributed to inherent group differences in response to TSD and stress, underscoring the validity of the data collected. Also, of note, the PVT and KSS performance results are similar to findings obtained in our sleep deprivation studies conducted in the laboratory (Dennis et al., 2017; Yamazaki and Goel, 2020; Casale et al., 2021; Yamazaki et al., 2021a,b).\nWe hypothesize that individuals with shorter pre-study LVET, who may be resilient to TSD and stress, may have a basal CV system that is in an \u201coverdrive\u201d aroused state marked by greater sympathetic activity. However, when these individuals experience stressful situations, such as acute TSD and psychological stress, parasympathetic activity increases, bringing autonomic balance into an optimal state and moderating the toll of these potent stressors, thereby maintaining performance. Additionally, it is possible that differences in preload and after load may be mediating the differences in CV status between the resilient and vulnerable groups. Future studies should test these hypotheses. Furthermore, past studies support our hypothesis regarding optimization of autonomic balance to maintain performance. Barber et al. (2020) found similar results to those in our study: participants with longer mean interbeat interval, thus lower HR, and greater parasympathetic activity had better performance during an attention task and cortical activity increased with elevated parasympathetic arousal during this task. Additionally, a study by Chua et al. (2014) found that individuals with lower HR during TSD had worse performance during this time, which is contrary to our findings and those of Barber et al. (2020). None of these studies implemented both TSD and stress, and it is possible that the synergistic combination of stressors changes autonomic balance and its effects on performance compared to a single stressor. Future research is needed to systematically explore the optimization of autonomic balance in order to maintain neurobehavioral performance.\nNotably, the SV, HR, and LVET changes across the study conditions in PVT resilient and vulnerable groups were similar to those in KSS resilient and vulnerable groups, as evinced by significant time\u2217PVT/KSS group interactions for each CV measure. This is despite the fact that the PVT, a behavioral attention measure, and the KSS, a self-reported sleepiness measure, represent two vastly different neurobehavioral performance domains (Dennis et al., 2017; Yamazaki and Goel, 2020). Moreover, those individuals categorized as resilient by the PVT were not necessarily categorized as resilient by KSS, as shown in this and other studies (Dennis et al., 2017; Yamazaki and Goel, 2020). Our findings therefore suggest a common underlying mechanism of resilience, which may be linked by the hemodynamic measures examined in this study. Further research should explore how CV measures may be related to or differentiate resilience and vulnerability using objective performance measures other than behavioral attention (e.g., memory, cognitive throughput, etc.), since, similar to the lack of\nFrontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org 12 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 795321\nassociation between objective and subjective measures (Dennis et al., 2017; Yamazaki and Goel, 2020), the vulnerability to such tasks during sleep loss is not necessarily related to PVT performance (Frey et al., 2004; Tkachenko and Dinges, 2018).\nDuring TSD AM, which may be the most difficult time to remain alert due to the circadian nadir (Goel et al., 2009), a sharp increase in SV and decrease in HR from baseline occurred in resilient participants. These inverse changes maintained the stability of CI in the resilient group. However, in the vulnerable group, although SV increased from baseline by a similar magnitude as in resilient participants, it was not matched by a decrease in HR. Thus, CI in vulnerable participants fluctuated across the study, and perhaps put those individuals at risk for cognitive decrements. Similarly, the KSS resilient participants had a large increase in SV from pre-study to TSD AM and also maintained CI stability. It is unclear whether HR or SV drove the change in the other measure and maintained CI in the resilient group.\nOf note, post-study HR failed to return to pre-study levels in the PVT resilient group. Yang et al. (2019) showed that at least three nights of recovery sleep are needed to fully restore autonomic functions that regulate the CV system. This may partially explain the lack of HR recovery in the PVT resilient group, though further research is needed to determine why this pattern was not observed in the vulnerable group. Additionally, our study\u2019s semi-isolated environment may have affected recovery length by changing brain structures in resilient individuals (Cromwell et al., 2021; Mhatre et al., 2021). Stahn et al. (2019) found that individuals had decreased brain and gray matter volume at the end of a 14-month isolation period, which recovered to pre-study levels 1.5 months after the end of the isolation. These structural changes may have occurred in our study and induced changes to autonomic control of the CV system, albeit within a shorter time frame. Our larger sample size may have provided more power to detect different CV recovery lengths in resilient versus vulnerable individuals, that were dependent on structural changes from isolation. Future studies are needed to examine this possibility.\nSimilarly, further research is also needed regarding the underlying correlates and neural dynamics of differential vulnerability to sleep loss, particularly in relation to various neurobehavioral measures and biomarkers. Previous work has identified the brain regions that are recruited by certain neurobehavioral metrics and determined how sleep deprivation affects these associations. For example, the PVT has been found to primarily recruit regions involved in vigilant attention (i.e., the prefrontal cortex, the inferior parietal cortex, the motor cortex, and the visual cortex) (Nasrini et al., 2020; Smith et al., 2021) and the KSS has been shown to primarily recruit regions involved in attention and sensory transmission (i.e., the thalamus and the right middle frontal gyrus) (Sun et al., 2020; Motomura et al., 2021). Though these findings are promising, more research is needed to identify reliable neural signatures of neurobehavioral resilience and vulnerability to sleep deprivation (Chee and Tan, 2010; Li et al., 2020; Zhu et al., 2020).\nThere was a significant condition effect across the study for both SBP and DBP, with increases in BP during TSD AM and\nPM, confirming that sleep deprivation and psychosocial stress have a detrimental effect on BP. However, resilient and vulnerable individuals did not have differential patterns in BP change across the study. The lack of differences may be due to the resilient and vulnerable groups maintaining BP by different mechanisms. The resilient group may have increased BP by increasing SV and LVET efficiency, while the vulnerable group may have used mechanisms other than SVRI to maintain BP. Since BP is prone to moment-to-moment fluctuations, we may not have been able to detect the differences between resilient and vulnerable individuals across the study (O\u2019Brien et al., 2003). Thus, in our study, BP was not a valid measure to identify and differentiate resilient versus vulnerable individuals to TSD and stress.\nNotably, all the CV measures we collected in this study showed a time-of-day effect (Cugini et al., 1993; Morris et al., 2013; Thosar et al., 2018). The changes in most of these measures from TSD AM to TSD PM in both the resilient and vulnerable groups were generally of the same magnitude. Thus, the resilient and vulnerable groups were likely not differentially affected by sleep loss and stress in terms of time-of-day, attributing the varying changes in resilient and vulnerable groups to other mechanisms.\nResilient and vulnerable groups showed differential cardiac reactivity to the stress of sleep deprivation and psychological stress conditions. Acute psychological stress typically increases HR and BP (Allen et al., 2014), yet there are individual differences in cardiac stress reactivity and differential consequences. Blunted reactivity to psychological stress is associated with obesity, selfreported negative health, and depression (Carroll et al., 2017; Turner et al., 2020). Exaggerated reactivity also has adverse long-term consequences to health via development of CVD (Carroll et al., 2017; Turner et al., 2020); however, in the case of performance during sleep loss and stress, exaggerated cardiac reactivity seems to be beneficial. This is exemplified by the resilient group\u2019s more drastic increases in SV and LVET and decrease in HR from pre-study to both TSD AM and TSD PM than in the vulnerable group. The resilient group\u2019s exaggerated response to sleep deprivation alone and in combination with the TSST may protect against attentional impairment. Thus, there may be a trade-off to resilience and vulnerability: vulnerable individuals may not perform well when sleep deprived but may have less risk for future adverse health outcomes because of their less extreme reactivity. Conversely, the resilient group may have greater risk for future adverse health outcomes, but also may perform better when they are sleep deprived. Future studies are needed to test these hypotheses.\nOur study was conducted in NASA\u2019s HERA mission, which is useful for examining the behavioral and physiological health impacts of various stressors, including sleep deprivation and isolation experienced during spaceflight (Barger et al., 2014; Cromwell et al., 2021; Mhatre et al., 2021); thus, our results demonstrate the importance of considering interindividual differences in vulnerability to sleep loss and stress between astronauts enduring both short and long duration missions. The current results are similar to findings comparing CV measures collected on the ground pre-spaceflight to measures collected post-long-duration spaceflight (Norsk et al., 2015). These parallels are advantageous for better predicting CV changes\nFrontiers in Physiology | www.frontiersin.org 13 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 795321\nresulting from long-duration spaceflight, which inevitably includes sleep deprivation and psychosocial stress (Barger et al., 2014; Cromwell et al., 2021; Mhatre et al., 2021). Norsk et al. (2015) found that SV increases with long-duration spaceflight, as was observed in our current experiment, thus demonstrating the potential application of predicting decrements to sleep loss and stress using CV measures in long-duration space missions.\nThere are a few limitations to this study. All participants in the study were healthy adults. Thus, these data may not be generalizable to clinical populations or to older adults in which lower basal cardiac output has been related to worse cognitive decline (Bown et al., 2020). Our findings may also not be generalizable to scenarios that do not involve isolation; however, isolation is required in studies investigating neurobehavioral and hemodynamic changes in high-fidelity space analogs, such as the present study, in order to simulate space flight conditions. Our results are limited to individual differences during sleep loss on the 10-min PVT and KSS, and our relatively small sample size did not allow for exploration of individual differences in a potential dose-response relationship. Furthermore, we used a median split to classify individuals as resilient or vulnerable or in pre-study low and high groups, which is a commonly utilized method in our field (Chuah et al., 2009; Rocklage et al., 2009; Chee and Tan, 2010; Diekelmann et al., 2010; Patanaik et al., 2015; Yeo et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2016; Moreno-Villanueva et al., 2018; Caldwell et al., 2020; Salfi et al., 2020), although other methods, such as tertile (Chua et al., 2014; Kong et al., 2015) or quartile splits (Chua et al., 2019), have also been utilized. Additionally, VTI of the CW wave form of the ascending aorta was used as a surrogate measure for LVOT VTI. Although echocardiography is a well-validated method to obtain SV, HR, CI, and LVET, using spectral analysis from electrocardiography may obtain a better picture of potential autonomic balance differences between resilient and vulnerable groups. Moreover, the short fasting period prior to biomarker collection may have slightly impacted CV measure outcomes, though this was necessary to maintain consistency throughout the experiment. Lastly, there was a small difference in sleep onset latency between KSS resilient and vulnerable groups on B1, but not on B2; this finding may suggest vulnerable individuals were sleepier on the first, but not the second night of the 5-day experiment, although we did not use a physiological measure of sleepiness (e.g., Maintenance of Wakefulness Test or Multiple Sleep Latency Test) to assess this explicitly.\nOur results open the door for research investigating whether pre-study LVET is a biomarker and may identify individual differences in metabolic responses to sleep loss\n(Spaeth et al., 2015), or be used in conjunction with genetic (Casale and Goel, 2021) and omic studies to further understand the biological factors underlying individual differences in response to TSD and stress (Goel, 2015). We show, for the first time, pre-study LVET differentiates deficits in neurobehavioral performance during TSD and psychosocial stress, may serve as a biomarker, and may inform future health risks."
