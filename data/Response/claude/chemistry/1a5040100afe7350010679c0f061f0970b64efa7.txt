 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the findings from this paper:

1. Examine the effects of chronic deferiprone treatment on phosphorylation of synaptic proteins like PSD-95 and Pacsin1 in the prefrontal cortex of 5-HTT KO mice. This could provide insight into whether the acute effects are sustained and lead to lasting changes in synaptic plasticity. 

2. Investigate if combining deferiprone with ketamine produces synergistic effects on glutamatergic signaling proteins and antidepressant behavioral outcomes. The two drugs seem to share some mechanisms like mTOR signaling.

3. Assess phosphorylation changes in dopaminergic regions like the ventral tegmental area and nucleus accumbens following acute and chronic deferiprone treatment. This could clarify the role of dopamine and pTH-Ser40 in the antidepressant actions.

4. Explore whether deferiprone modulates nitric oxide signaling through effects on proteins like PSD-95, HRH1 and NDRG1. NOS pathways seem implicated but need further study. 

5. Examine the effects of deferiprone treatment in hippocampus and amygdala on the phosphoproteome, since these regions are dysfunctional in 5-HTT KO mice. The changes may be more extensive than in prefrontal cortex.
