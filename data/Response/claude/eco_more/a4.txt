 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Study how changing the parameters of the estimated network formation model affects vulnerability contagion. The paper finds evidence of positive externalities in link formation, which likely leads to a denser network more prone to contagion. It would be interesting to simulate different network structures based on changes to the model parameters, and analyze the impact on vulnerability spread.

2. Extend the analysis to dependency graphs of other programming languages like Java, C++, Python etc. The paper focuses only on Rust, but it would be useful to compare across languages and see if there are common patterns or language-specific differences in how dependency networks form. 

3. Incorporate forward-looking strategic behavior into the network formation model. The current model assumes myopic link decisions, but allowing for forward-looking agents could provide insights into how developers make intertemporal tradeoffs in managing dependencies.

4. Study the co-evolution of dependency networks and vulnerability emergence using longitudinal data. This could shed light on whether certain network structures are more resilient or vulnerable to shocks from new vulnerabilities.

5. Analyze the effectiveness of different policy interventions, like auditing requirements or incentives for secure coding practices, in shaping dependency networks and limiting contagion. The results could guide policy aimed at improving software ecosystem security.
