    "abstractText": "Can ordinary Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (MEMS) microphones be used for nearultrasonic applications? Manufacturers often provide little information about the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) in the ultrasound (US) range and, if they do, the data are often determined in a manufacturerspecific manner and are generally not comparable. Here, four different air-based microphones from three different manufacturers are compared with respect to their transfer functions and noise floor. The deconvolution of an exponential sweep and a traditional calculation of the SNR are used. The equipment and methods used are specified, which makes it easy to repeat or expand the investigation. The SNR of MEMS microphones in the near US range is mainly affected by resonance effects. These can be matched for applications with low-level signals and background noise such that the highest possible SNR can be achieved. Two MEMS microphones from Knowles performed best for the frequency range from 20 to 70 kHz; above 70 kHz, an Infineon model delivered the best performance.",

            "text": "In photoacoustic spectroscopy, energy is applied to a sample by means of modulated laser excitation. The absorbed energy is converted into a local temperature increase, which results in expansion of the gas, followed by relaxation [1]. This pressure or sound wave is usually inaudible due to small amplitude and, often, high frequency. Therefore, photoacoustic methods require very sensitive sound sensors. Micro-Electro-Mechanical-Systems (MEMS) microphones have many advantages in the application, as they are produced cheaply and, due to their compact form, can be integrated in small sensors. Many MEMS microphones can be applied in the ultrasonic range, even if they have not been explicitly designed for this purpose. However, above the first mechanical resonance, the sensitivity of the microphone is strongly frequency dependent [2]. Therefore, the analysis of the transfer function is particularly relevant. In addition, the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is often quantified by the manufacturers only up to 20 kHz. Therefore, a thorough characterization is advisable before selecting a microphone. MEMS microphones have been the subject of reviews [3,4] and are considered as ultrasonic transducers, especially for photoacoustic imaging [5]. Photoacoustic sensors often take advantage of resonators to amplify the acoustic signal. Since the PA signal is inversely proportional to the volume of the cell (or the resonator), often high frequencies in the ultrasound range occur. For instance, the resonant frequency of the optimized resonator for non-invasive glucose measurement falls within the nearultrasound (US) range [6,7]. Frequencies between 20 kHz and 1 MHz are also of interest for PA imaging, as these relatively low frequencies come along with less acoustic attenuation. Therefore, deeper tissue layers can be investigated [8,9].\nSensors 2023, 23, 2774. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23052774 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2023, 23, 2774 2 of 9\nHere we compare transfer functions and SNRs of four differential MEMS microphones in the frequency range between 20 and 80 kHz.

The sensitivity and the SNR, both measured by the manufacturer with a sinewave of 1 kHz and 94 dB SPL and noise from 20 Hz to 20 kHz, were extracted from the datasheet.\nThe transfer function and the SNR were measured with the experimental setup shown in Figure 1. Since ultrasonic loudspeakers are not standardized, a well characterized piezo loudspeaker was used (Kemo Electronic, L10, Geestland, Germany). u(t) represents its voltage and p(t) is the resulting pressure wave. s(t) is the output signal of the MEMS microphone after differential amplification. The two channels u(t) and s(t) are recorded simultaneously by an oscilloscope (Pico Technology, Picoscope 544D, St. Neots, Cambridgeshire, UK). A function generator (Agilent, 32220a LXI, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was operated via SCPI by a PC to control the ultrasound speaker. The microphone was centrally positioned 19 cm in front of the speaker. The distance represents a compromise between high signal level and the fulfillment of the requirement for the far-field condition, where interference effects have a minor influence. In the sound field between the loudspeaker and the microphone, reflections were reduced with the aid of absorber material placed all around. The entire setup is controlled by a MatLab program running on the PC. To put the differential microphones into operation, the electronic circuit shown in Figure 2a was designed. It is based on a commercial differential amplifier (Burr-Brown, INA105, Tucson, AZ, USA). The differential amplifier has a gain of 1, therefore it has no effect on the sensitivity. In addition, it exhibits a low noise amplitude spectral density of 60 nV\u221a\nHz , with 0.001% maximum nonlinearities and 0.01% maximum gain error [10]. The\nIN+/\u2212 inputs are suitable for the differential outputs of the different microphone boards. An exemplarily technical drawing is shown in Figure 2b. C1 represents a blocking capacitor.

All harmonics were also normalized according to the maximum of the fundamental (in Figure 3). It was found that the contribution of the higher harmonics is also strongly frequency dependend. Above 70 kHz, the harmonics are continously increasing for all microphones. The frequency dependency of the harmonics roughly follows the course of the fundamentals. However, the magnitude of the first harmonic is approximately 25 dB smaller than that of the fundamental transfer function, while from 20 to 40 kHz the second harmonic is smaller by another 10 dB on average. A large difference between the fundamental and the harmonics indicates a lower distortion factor and also reduces the SNR to a certain degree. Thus, the applicability of the microphones for low-level signals, as in photoacoustic measurements, improves. In comparison, the IM73 exhibits a relatively low contribution of first and second harmonics. Above 70 kHz, the first harmonic of the Ellen microphone increases significantly; between 50 and 60 kHz, the contribution of the second harmonic is especially large for the ICS microphone and, at 55 and 57 kHz, has even a larger magnitude than the fundamental itself.

In order to estimate the proportion of harmonics, the transmission behavior of the first, see Figure 4, and second harmonic transfer function, see Figure 5, were measured. All harmonics were also normalized according to the maximum of the fundamental (in Figure 3). It was found that the contribution of the higher harmonics is also strongly frequency dependend.\nAbove 70 kHz, the harmonics are continously increasing for all microphones. The frequency dependency of the harmonics roughly follows the course of the fundamentals. However, the magnitude of the first harmonic is approximately 25 dB smaller than that of the fundamental transfer function, while from 20 to 40 kHz the second harmonic is smaller by another 10 dB on average. A large difference between the fundamental and the harmonics indicates a lower distortion factor and also reduces the SNR to a certain degree. Thus, the applicability of the microphones for low-level signals, as in photoacoustic measurements, improves.\nFigure 4.
