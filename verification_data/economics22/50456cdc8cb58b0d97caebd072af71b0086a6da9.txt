"According to Cong et al. (2022) [20], the degree of decentralization and the stability of the trading network are both important factors in building trust for decentralized banks and increasing the inclusiveness of the decentralized bank platform. We, therefore, conducted a comparative study of four major decentralized banks including Liquity, Aave, MakerDao, and Compound, evaluating transaction decentralization using social network analysis. We made two major findings: first, the largest externally owned address cores for LQTY, LUSD, AAVE, Dai, and COMP mainly include exchanges such as Huobi, Coinbase, and Binance, second, MakerDao and Compound are more decentralized in trading than AAVE and Liquity. Second, as LQTY has not yet been listed on some exchanges, such as Binance, the token may be less well known. How would the internal design features of governance, airdrop, loan before deposits, and stablecoins and the external events such as blockchain mechanisms upgrade [47, 32] affect network decentralization and other desired properties [48]?"
