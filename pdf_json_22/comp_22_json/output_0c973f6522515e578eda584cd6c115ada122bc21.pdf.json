            "text": "Evaluation of the number of viable microorganisms in a sample is a commonly used method in most microbiology laboratories. The method consists of counting visible colonies on agar plates and calculating the number of colony-forming units per mL (or gram) of the sample. For example, it is widely used for food, clinical, environmental, and drug safety testing. The counting of bacteria is usually carried out manually, and is, therefore, subjective and error-prone [1]. At present, automatic digital counters are common in laboratories and some have highly efficient automatic counting methods, which have replaced manual counting methods. Although the counting of visible colonies on agar plates is the most commonly used method to assess bacterial populations, with the advantage of only considering the counts of viable cells [2], it is time-consuming, laborious and requires at least 24 h or more for visible colonies to form. This can be a considerable limitation in some situations, such as quality control of certain foods and in clinical settings, where fast results are required so that actions can rapidly be implemented. One important factor in cell counting is the analyst\u2019s ability to see colonies distinctly. Colony morphology is used to select bacteria as phenotypically different. This is normally carried out by visual inspection, and the selected parameters are often colony size, color, texture, edge, and elevation, according to the colony morphology protocol emitted by the American Society for Microbiology [3]. In a previous work, a software capable of semi-automatically quantifying the number of colonies in Petri plates from a digital image was developed [4]. This method did not, however, automatically distinguish different colony types. Thus, in the present work, we attempted to include this distinguishing characteristic. Therefore, three bacterial species (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus) that represent the predominant pathogenic microorganisms in a variety of settings\u2014food [5], clinical [6] and environmental [7]\u2014were used to evaluate and develop our solution/software to support\nBioengineering 2023, 10, 26. https://doi.org/10.3390/bioengineering10010026 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/bioengineering\nBioengineering 2023, 10, 26 2 of 8\ncolony discrimination.

All experiments were carried out in triplicate. Colony enumeration was performed and the number of colonies was recorded and posteriorly attributed to each image of the database. The final dataset [12] consists of about 1252 labeled Petri images with 422 colonies of Escherichia coli, 431 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 399 of Staphylococcus aureus.

For more details please check the Keras default models at https://keras.io/api/applications/, accessed on 20 November 2022. Due to the relatively high resolution of all images, the samples were scaled down to [303 \u00d7 404 \u00d7 3] to reduce the computation time and guarantee proper aspect ratios. Thus, the patches of each neural network architecture were resized to match the default input layer size. The output layer of each used standard CNN keras models [13], and was also replaced by a dense layer with 50 units and softmax as the activation function to obtain, as output, in a blinding feature extraction process, 50 features from each colony to serve as vector inputs for several classical ML models: decision trees (DT), support-vector machines (SVM), K-nearest neighbors (KNN), multi-layer perceptron (MLP) and three ensemble classifiers (please check Table 2 for more details). The models\u2019 performance was evaluated within a leave-one-out-cross-validation procedure, a well-known process that allows for the use of all datasets for testing, without leakage between train and test sets. In this work, the feature extraction and the classification were carried out in a cloudbased service, the Google Colaboratory. The software code was developed in PythonJupyter Notebook for machine-learning and deep-learning operations within a virtual machine with two Intel Xeon CPUs both at 2.20 GHz, 100 GB of storing, and 13 GB of Ram.\nThe evaluation metric for colony detection was based on the Accuracy and F1-score [14]. Accuracy shows how many cases were correctly labelled out of all the cases, and is defined as,\nAccuracy = TruePositives + TrueNegatives\nTruePositives + TrueNegatives + FalsePositives + FalseNegatives \u00d7 100% (1)\nwhere a TruePositive is an outcome in which the MP model correctly predicts a positive class, a TrueNegative is an outcome where the model correctly predicts the negative class, a FalsePositive is an outcome where the model incorrectly predicts the positive class and, finally, FalseNegative is an outcome where the model incorrectly predicts the negative class [14].\nThe F1-score is the harmonic mean of precision and recall and can be defined as,\nF1-score = 2 \u00d7 precision \u00d7 recall precision + recall \u00d7 100% (2)\nBioengineering 2023, 10, 26 4 of 8\nwhere precision and recall are, respectively,\nprecision = TruePositives\nTruePositives + FalsePositives (3)\nand recall =\nTruePositives TruePositives + FalseNegatives\n(4)\nThus, if the F1-score is high, both the precision and recall of the classifier indicate good results [14]."

Accuracies higher than 84% were obtained for all pairs, with at least one combination of deep and classical machine-learning methods. The combination of classifiers MobileNet-XGBoost provided the best results for all study pair classifications; in this way, it was shown to be a good candidate combination for differentiating colonies. The XGBoost was shown to be the most effective classical machine-learning classifier, as 81% (82 of 93) of the best combinations of deep and classical machine-learning have XGBoost as a classifier. The group pairs comparisons that involved Staphylococcus aureus achieved high Accuracy and F1-score rates, above 91%. One of the explanations for these results is that Staphylococcus aureus produces yellow colonies [15] on a plate, which are very typical and differentiated from the Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa that produce beige colonies on a plate [16,17]. As Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonies are both beige on a plate, the problem of differentiating each becomes more difficult for the classifiers. Even so, the proposed methods achieved good ratios of Accuracy and F1-score \u2248 84% on Escherichia coli vs. Pseudomonas aeruginosa discrimination. The graphic of Figure 2 shows the best discrimination results between the study groups. The results are in line with those found in the state-of-art literature (please check Table 1) and provides us with a good indication that, if we continue to improve and refine the algorithm, we can build an even more helpful, powerful, and robust tool for this purpose.\nBioengineering 2023, 10, 26 5 of 8\nBioengineering 2023, 10, 26 6 of 8\nBioengineering 2023, 10, 26 7 of 8"

In order to test and validate the system, images of three bacterial species (Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus) cultured in Petri plates were presented to the CNN models\u2019 entries to extract 50 image features to feed classical machine-learning models within a leave-one-out-cross validation procedure. The system demonstrated good accuracy discrimination rates between pairs of study groups: 92% for Pseudomonas aeruginosa vs. Staphylococcus aureus, 91% for Escherichia coli vs. Staphylococcus aureus and 84% Escherichia coli vs. Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The presented preliminary results showed that a combination of deep-learning models and classical machine-learning models can help to discriminate bacteria colonies in Petri-plates. Tools, such as the one developed in the present work, are really valuable in ascertaining different colony types in a single step, using a general, whole-purpose medium instead of several selective and/or differential media, rendering the process time-consuming, expensive, and prone to errors due to the increased manipulation steps required by the operator. Furthermore, differential colony counting is quite useful, since most analyzed samples in a microbiology setting are not pure-culture, but mixed cultures involving more than one bacterial species. In future work, the dataset should be extended to more bacteria colony types to evaluate the system\u2019s ability to discriminate other species and should include a set of pictures containing a mixture of colonies to evaluate the accuracy of the method in a mixed/complex sample. Additionally, the deep and classical machine-learning models should be refined to improve the system\u2019s performance.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, P.M.R.; methodology, P.M.R. and P.R.; validation, P.M.R.; investigation, P.M.R. and P.R.; writing\u2014original, P.M.R. and F.K.T.; writing\u2014review and editing, P.M.R., P.R. and F.K.T.; supervision, P.M.R. and F.K.T.; funding acquisition, P.M.R.
