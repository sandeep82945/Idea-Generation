Many of them are related to psychological factors, such as: isolation, change of existing habits, fear of getting sick and dying, fear of losing a job and fears related to the financial situation, which resulted in an increase in the occurrence of diseases and mental disorders such as adaptation and anxiety disorders, depression. t has been also reported that treatment in conditions of intensive care unit lead to high prevalence of psychiatric disorders like PTSD in discharged patients. In our own studies we observed that patients with new appearing psychiatric symptoms were mostly those, who were professionally active, but did not work remotely. The time the patients spent at home had a negative impact on their well-being, they generally felt worse, their family life suffered more frequently. The most common cognitive symptoms, which are reported embrace: problems with shortand longterm memory, lack of mental clarity, feeling eclipsed, lightheaded, poor concentration, mental fatigue. We also present here a series of post-acute COVID cases from the examined population and provide a concise comparison of observed symptomatology with previous reports.",

The complexity of our object of study - the use of new technologies for people\u2019s mental health - requires undertaking a multi-disciplinary approach, considering both the clinical and the socio-anthropological aspects. A mixed-methods research conducted with pepole people experiencing anxiety, carers and professionnals, aims to describe the use, acceptability and needs of the different categories of actors concerned by the use of new technologies. The quantitative part is a cross-sectional, descriptive, observational study. A anonymous self-administered questionnaire is distributed online and in hard copy in the 5 partner countries (Belgium, France, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK) to the three study populations. It consists of access to digital tools or technological solutions, experience related to these and the contribution and perceived effect of users to e-mental health related projects. The qualitative approach includes a detailed understanding of the potential therapeutic and socio-anthropological changes that these tools can bring. It explores : description of used technologies, the representations and emerging needs in relation to the management of anxiety and the improvement of mental health ; the clinical impact perceived by all stakeholders and the implementation of newways of living with the tools. This international research will enable a comparative study to be carried out on the dynamics of appropriation of these e-(mental) health devices in different countries of the North-Western European region.\nDisclosure: No significant relationships.

De Moffarts\nCentre Neuro Psychiatrique St Martin, Centre Neuro Psychiatrique Saint Martin, Namur, Belgium doi: 10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.106\nTechnological innovations give new perspectives in many fields, including health. It was in this context that the IT4Anxiety project was born in 2019 bringing together mental health professionals and start-ups, but also universities, research centres, higher education establishments and public authorities from the North-West Region of Europe. The project is challenging our ability, as partners, to gather stakeholders from different background, medical and nonmedical field, in order to support the implementation and co-conception of innovative solutions with the objective of reducing the anxiety of mental health service users. During the four years of project implementation (2019-2023), the stakeholders will have opportunities to work with the end-users, expecting to address the needs of around 3,000 mental health service users suffering from anxiety. The fifteen start-up involved in the project activities will be recruited through hackathons and calls based on identified needs. They will join the project in order to test and improve their solutions. This will create opportunities to connect the start-ups with the medical world, research codes and procedures and to give them a new perspective in the understanding of their targeted market segment. Furthermore, almost a thousand mental health professionals will be trained in e-mental health, benefiting from our\nhttps://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.104 Published online by Cambridge University Press"
