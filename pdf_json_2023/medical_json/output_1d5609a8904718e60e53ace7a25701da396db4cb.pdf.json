    "abstractText": "Diversity of phage propagation, physical properties, and assembly promotes the use of phages in ecological studies and biomedicine. However, observed phage diversity is incomplete. Bacillus thuringiensis siphophage, 0105phi-7-2, first described here, significantly expands known phage diversity, as seen via in-plaque propagation, electron microscopy, whole genome sequencing/annotation, protein mass spectrometry, and native gel electrophoresis (AGE). Average plaque diameter vs. plaque-supporting agarose gel concentration plots reveal unusually steep conversion to large plaques as agarose concentration decreases below 0.2%. These large plaques sometimes have small satellites and are made larger by orthovanadate, an ATPase inhibitor. Phage head\u2013host-cell binding is observed by electron microscopy. We hypothesize that this binding causes plaque size-increase via biofilm evolved, ATP stimulated ride-hitching on motile host cells by temporarily inactive phages. Phage 0105phi7-2 does not propagate in liquid culture. Genomic sequencing/annotation reveals history as temperate phage and distant similarity, in a virion-assembly gene cluster, to prototypical siphophage SPP1 of Bacillus subtilis. Phage 0105phi7-2 is distinct in (1) absence of head-assembly scaffolding via either separate protein or classically sized, head protein-embedded peptide, (2) producing partially condensed, head-expelled DNA, and (3) having a surface relatively poor in AGE-detected net negative charges, which is possibly correlated with observed low murine blood persistence.",

Within the context of thermodynamics, evolution generates events that can be interpreted as purposeful and ordergenerating [4]. Variations in the environment cause variations in microbial evolution, as seen in the evolution of multidrug resistant bacteria for which phages are sought as therapeutics (phage therapy [5\u201313]). Thus, the details of phage propagation are expected to vary in ways that are potentially useful for both understanding evolution and using phages for phage therapy and other areas of biomedicine. The possibility exists that our current understanding of evolved phage characteristics is limited by the way in which phages have been isolated, most via liquid culture [10\u201313]. For example, no membrane-containing, single-stranded RNA phage has been isolated [14]. If these latter phages exist, finding a way to isolate them will provide (1) a more accessible model for understanding common aspects of assembly and (2) a display vaccine-vector\nInt. J. Mol.

Thus, we screened previously isolated, uncharacterized phages for unusual properties. The phages had been isolated and 3\u00d7 cloned by in-gel propagation only [17,18] and had not been further investigated. Investigation of these phages had stopped, in part, because of limitations of genome sequencing technology, including its cost. These limitations have subsequently been removed (reviews [19,20]). In the current study, we describe characterization of one of these phages, 0105phi7-2, which is found to be novel in several ways. Novelty begins with the characteristics of in-gel propagation, which suggest that 0105phi7-2 sometimes attaches, in a noninfective state, to its motile host and rides with the host to places of higher intact host concentration. Novelty continues with capsid assembly, expelled DNA conformation, and surface electrical charge on the capsid, the latter a possible indicator of phage persistence in blood. The data suggest previous evolution in biofilms. The details are presented here."

Although with a smaller slope change, the same has been found true for a larger phage, 0305phi8-36, also propagated B. thuringiensis [18]. This change in slope was not explained in previous studies.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 8941 12 of 21\nThe following observations indicate that this change in slope is primarily an effect of the plaque-embedding gel on the bacterial host, not on the phage. Agarose is chemically inert to proteins and nucleic acids; that is why agarose/agar is used as an electrophoretic and a growth medium. Thus, we assume that the slope change is an effect of sieving. The particle being sieved must be close in size to the size of the effective diameter of pores of the 0.2% Seakem Gold agarose gel (2 \u00d7 PE in [42]), given the abruptness of the slope change. At A = 0.2, the value of 2 \u00d7 PE for Seakem LE agarose is 1480 nm [42]. Seakem Gold has a lower electro-osmosis and higher gel strength [43], which indicate an even larger 2 \u00d7 PE at A = 0.2 [42]. The high gel strength of Seakem Gold is a major reason for its use in the current study. Neither phage 0105phi7-2 (head, <65 nm in diameter; tail, 150 nm long) nor phage T4 (head, 90\u2013115 nm in diameter; tail, ~100 nm long [41]) is close in size to the 2 \u00d7 PE of 1480 nm. Thus, the phages are too small to cause the change in slope via sieving. However, the bacterial hosts are about the right size to cause this change in slope. Both hosts are 500\u2013700 nm wide and 1000\u20133000 nm long [44]. In fact, when these bacteria propagate in 0.6\u20130.8% Seakem Gold agarose gels, they are large enough so that, as they grow, they push aside fibers of the gel, as seen by electron microscopy [44]. Thus, we conclude that the increase in slope as A decreases below 0.2 (Figure 3) is caused primarily by increase in the freedom of bacterial motion, for both phage 0105phi7-2 and phage T4."

One possibility is that ATP promotes phage head\u2013host-cell binding, which is suggested by the observed head\u2013host binding described in Section 2.1 (Figure 1c) and supported in Sections 2.5 and 2.7 (Figures 6d and 7d). The head\u2013host-cell bound phages would be noninfective, until their heads detached from the host cell, for example, when a region of lower ATP concentration is reached. Thus, we propose the hypothesis that, for A below 0.2, (1) host mobility increase is accompanied by ATP-promoted phage head\u2013host cell binding that results in \u201cride-hitching\u201d on motile host cells, (2) 0105phi7-2 becomes noninfective when head-host bound, and (3) subsequently, at lower ATP concentration, 0105phi7-2 converts to tail\u2013host binding, followed by DNA injection that is not detected in thin sections. This hypothesis explains the turbid strip between satellites and main plaque (Figure 4) as a region through which phages are transported in a mostly noninfective state. Via phage ride-hitching, this hypothesis also explains orthovanadate-induced increase in plaque size. The orthovanadate also has the potential to counter this stimulatory effect by inhibiting bacterial motility. Thus, the hypothesis includes the assumption that this counter-effect is, sometimes, smaller than the stimulatory effect on ride-hitching. Indeed, the nonuniformity of the presence of satellites (Figure 4) might be explained by inter-plaque variability in the outcome of competition between the stimulatory and counter-stimulatory effect of ATP on ride-hitching. A subtext is the hypothesis that in-gel propagating bacterial cells undergo nonthermal motion away from relatively high ATP concentrations. This is logical because high ATP concentrations signal the presence of cell-lysing particles. The phage counters by binding to the bacteria. Finally, the positive \u03c3-state of the phage might be the state that is head\u2013 host-cell binding, given that the surfaces of bacteria are negatively charged [45,46]. If so, phage 0105phi7-2 must have a history of evolution in a semisolid medium that does not flow, i.e., a biofilm [47,48]. Otherwise, fluid flows, not cellular activities, are the dominant determinants of the positions of phages and host cells.\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 8941 13 of 21"

            "text": "The above hypothesis is consistent with the observation (Section 2.3) that phage 0105phi7-2 does not propagate in liquid culture, in that, by this hypothesis, phage 0105phi72 requires a biofilm-like (i.e., a gelled [47,48]) environment. This environment is provided here by an agarose gel. Our original use of in-gel propagation was designed, in part, to increase the probability of isolating biofilm-inhabiting phages. B. subtilis phage SPP1 [49,50] and Lactobacillus phage TP901-1 [51] were chosen as prototypes for comparison of the structural proteins of 0105phi7-2 because they have been characterized by cryo-EM and thus provided detailed information about the role of each protein in the phage structure. These are, however, not close relatives of 0105phi7-2, based on genomic sequence. They represent a very large section of siphophages, hosted by Gram-positive bacteria, with similar structure. BlastP searches of NCBI nr with 0105phi7-2 protein sequences reveal (1) at least nine isolated phages of B. thuringiensis that are much closer to 0105phi7-2 in a mosaic pattern of similarity and (2) innumerable matches to proteins from segments of B. thuringiensis chromosomes, segments that are presumptive prophages or prophage remnants. The extent to which the unusual growth properties of 0105phi7-2 are distributed in the population of close relatives is unknown."

            "text": "Phage 0105phi7-2 is found here to have two properties that can help simplify analysis of phage DNA packaging. First, the partially decondensed genomes provide improved access to the conformation of the packaged genome. For example, the axis observed in images of these genomes (Figure 7b,c) implies a similar axis of the fully packaged genome and also that this axis (1) is coincident with the channel of DNA entry and (2) formed without assistance of additional coaxial internal proteins, such as those found [52] in phages T3 and T7. The second property is low assembly assistance for gp6 (no scaffolding protein; minimal, if any, N-terminal peptide removed during assembly). The only apparent example of comparably short peptide removal is the removal of an approximately 14-amino acid peptide from the N-terminus of the major head protein of siphophage 80a of Staphylococcus aureus [53]. However, a scaffolding protein was present in this case. This property of 0105phi7-2 suggests a lower conformation-based energy barrier between the procapsid and mature capsid states of the major head protein. Reasoning by analogy with coliphage P2 [54], 0105phi7-2 scaffolding might be generated by a peptide released from the C-terminal region of gp5 by the N-terminal protease activity of gp5. Relatively low energy-barrier transitions of this protein can also explain the finding of two electrophoretically (\u03c3)-defined states of the mature phage. A similar finding, though with less difference in \u03c3-values, has been made for phage T7. In the case of T7, both states had negative \u03c3 and phages in the least negative-\u03c3 state were more adsorptive to host cells [55]. Flexibility for T7 state interconversion appears to be assisted by the presence of major head protein molecules of two different lengths [55]. Both electrophoretic states of 0105phi7-2 are relatively low in negative surface charge, which is reasonably thought to promote low blood persistence. Low murine blood persistence is, indeed, found here for 0105phi7-2 (Figure 10). More work is needed to determine how completely low persistence is correlated with a relatively low component of negative surface charges. Efficient screening out of low-persistence phages, possibly based on \u03c3, is expected to improve phage therapy of infectious disease [37]. Thus, this work appears to be at the top of the priority list for phage therapy."

One way to organize thinking about the function of orfans is to assume that function is correlated with position in the genome. Analysis of orfan-annotated gene neighbors in several different phage sequences, without any biochemical analysis of orfan gene products, has led to the conclusion that small gene orfans of phage T4 have a function linked to that of neighboring genes for proteins of the T4 base plate [56]. This logic implies that 0105phi7-2 genes 7 and 8 have functions in assembly, although these genes are not otherwise annotated. Finally, the complete map of the 0105phi7-2 genome has the following genes that suggest that 0105phi7-2 has history as a temperate phage: immunity repressor homologs, orfs29, 40; anti-repressor protein homolog, orf 46.

The following question arises. Can we obtain a complete understanding of phage evolution and phage biomedical potential without managing phage propagation eccentricities? When one considers that (1) metagenomic analysis has identified phages with 634, 636, 642, and 735 kb genomes [57] and that, among isolated/propagated phages, only phage G has a comparably sized genome [58], the likely answer is no. Additionally, phage G was isolated in Italy 54 years ago [58] as part of what is logically described as a freak accident [59,60]. We have attempted (and presumably others have also) to isolate phages with either longer or comparably long genomes, without success, even though we have demonstrated that dilute agarose gels accommodate them [23]. Also significant in this area is the fact that phage G was almost lost in ~year 2000. Phage G was saved from extinction by the efforts of S.J. Hayes who retrieved what is today wild-type phage G from an almost completely dead preparation. A second trying episode occurred about five years ago when we confirmed that phage G did not survive prolonged freezing. The bottom line was that phage eccentricities were not to be avoided, but embraced, if we were to progress. A key aspect for the future is the speed of phage isolation and characterization. Most phages isolated are expected to be either too \u201cnot novel\u201d or too \u201cnot useful\u201d to further pursue in detail. High speed of isolation and characterization is essential to move through the forest of existing phages. In-gel propagation helps for this purpose, the rate of isolation being capable of exceeding 50 phages per week per person. Additionally, determining D vs. A helps to start the characterization. Electron microscopy of plaques can further help, as shown above. A key objective for the future is increasing the efficiency, in time and cost, of the characterization of phages for various purposes, including phage therapy of infectious disease."
