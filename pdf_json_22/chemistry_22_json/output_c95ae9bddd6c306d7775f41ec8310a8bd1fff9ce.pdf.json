    "abstractText": "Original work showed the composition of the dyes and the antimicrobial/UV protective properties of a series of dyes obtained in our laboratories over the past twelve years in an easy way using microwave technology and their comparisons with conventional methods. The results we obtained clearly indicated that by using the microwave strategy, we were able to synthesize the new disperse dyes in minutes and with a much higher productivity when compared to the traditional methods, which took a much longer time, sometimes up to hours. We also introduced ultrasonic technology in dyeing polyester fabrics at 80 \u25e6C for an environmentally friendly approach, which was an alternative to traditional dyeing methods at 100 \u25e6C; we obtained a much higher color depth than traditional dyeing methods reaching 102.9%. We presented both the biological activity of the prepared new dyes and the fastness properties and clearly indicated that these dyes possess biological activity and high fastness properties.We presented through the results that when dyeing polyester fabrics with some selected disperse dyes, the color strength of polyester fabrics dyed at high temperatures was greater than the color strength of polyester fabrics dyed at low temperatures by 144%, 186%, 265% and 309%. Finally, we presented that a ZnO or TiO2 NPs post-dyeing treatment of polyester fabrics is promising strategy for producing polyester fabrics possess multifunction like self-cleaning property, high light fastness, antimicrobial and anti-ultraviolet properties.",

It is known that azo dyes are widely used in textile dyeing in view of environmental pollution, so azo dyes harm the environment if their effluents are not treated. Among these treatments are modern techniques using ultrasound, infrared, microwaves, and ultraviolet rays to improve the fabric\u2019s absorption capacity for dyes and reduce effluents load from dyeing processes [13\u2013 24]. Some recent reports [1,2] have used ultrasound energy to improve the dyeing of polyester fabrics when dyeing with disperse dyes by modifying the surface of the fabric. Additionally, some studies [3] confirmed that UV rays can be used to improve the color fastness properties without compromising the chemical properties of polyester fabric. One of the environmentally friendly advantages of using microwave energy is the rapid heating to high temperatures that allows for greater ease of reactions, because increasing the frequency of molecular vibrations during microwave irradiation speeds up these reactions as well as reduces the use of solvents [25\u201366]. Skin cancer and sensitive skin are primarily caused by prolonged exposure to ultraviolet radiation from sunlight. Therefore, the best choice is to locate well-designed clothing composed of ultraviolet-blocking materials. One of the qualities cloth should have is the ability to filter ultraviolet rays, either by containing an ultraviolet absorber or by being dyed, as dyed fabrics offer better sun protection than bleached materials. Therefore, it could be claimed that dyed cloths with darker colors may provide better protection from the Sun rays [1,4]. According to a literature survey, pyrazolopyrimidines, pyridones and enaminones are significant key intermediates in the production of new azo dyes, particularly disperse dyes with numerous biological applications. Because of their facile synthesis, low cost, and great efficacy against bacterial infections, they are now widely employed as antimicrobial agents [4]. In general, the kinds of substituted function present in the heterocyclic ring structure, as well as the form of the heterocyclic system, have a significant impact on the antibacterial activity of the entire molecule. The majority of the matching substituted analogues had stronger antibacterial inhibitory activities that were on par with or better than the reference drugs. A lot of researchers are now interested in creating smart fabrics for human wellbeing. The need to create materials that improve defense against microorganisms such as bacteria or fungi is expanding. Due to their propensity to retain moisture, fabrics can act as transporters and ideal environments for the growth of germs such as bacteria, especially when they come into contact with the human body. Therefore, it is essential to create textiles that are microbe-resistant. To produce smart fabrics, we had to improve the functional performance of polyester fabrics by using nanotechnology. To increase their anti-bacterial and UVprotective properties and to achieve this goal, nanoparticles were used, especially metal oxides and metal nanoparticles. The potential mechanism behind titanium dioxide NPs\u2019 antibacterial action is their photocatalytic function, which results in the generation of extraordinarily active oxygen species, such as super oxide anions, hydrogen peroxide, singlet oxygen, and hydroxyl radicals, which kill bacteria. Due to the presence of the outer cell wall membrane in the G-ve bacteria, which acts as a barrier to the antibacterial action, the NPs-treated polyester fabric demonstrated greater antibacterial activity against G+ve bacteria in companion with G-ve bacteria. In this review article, we present the contributions of our laboratories over the past twelve years using modern technologies such as ultrasound or microwave technology to synthesize many new disperse dyes while demonstrating their biological activities. We will not only present the use of modern technologies such as ultrasound or microwave technology in dyeing polyester fabrics and compare them with traditional dyeing methods but also discuss the process of treating polyester fabrics dyed with ZnO or TiO2 NPs and whether it achieved a UV protection factor, as well as the ability of these polyester fabrics to improve the properties of self-cleaning, light fastness and, antimicrobial activities.\nPolymers 2022, 14, 3966 3 of 23"

When compound 11 was combined with diazonium salt 2 in the presence of ethyl alcohol/sodium acetate, a high yield of hydrazone 13\u201485%, was produced. In order to help construct the structure of 13, NOE experiments were conducted. The results demonstrated that irradiating the NH signal at 12.1 ppm induced an amplification of the aryl proton resonances at 7.39 and 6.80 ppm (Scheme 2) [60]. Hydrazone 13 and hydrazine hydrate were combined to create the disperse dye 15 by refluxing the mixture for four hours while adding ethanol as a solvent. According to NOE difference measurements, irradiation of the NH signal at 11.94 ppm corresponding to compound 15 boosted the methyl proton signal at 2.36 ppm. Through refluxing for an hour in the presence of acetic acid and sodium acetate, dyes 14 or 15 easily condensed with the enaminones 8a\u2013d to generate disperse dyes 16a\u2013d or 16f\u2013h (Scheme 2) [60].

Based on X-ray crystallographic structure determination, pyridine 19 could be combined with different diazonium salts 21 to create the disperse dyes 22a\u2013i that exist in the hydrazone tautomeric form, as shown in Scheme 3. (Figures 4 and 5).\nPolymers 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 24 One of the sequences used in the synthesis of the disperse dye16a\u2013h was the coupling of malononitrile 10 with diazonium salt 2 to generate compound 12. (Scheme 2). An increase in the aryl proton signal resulted from irradiating the hydroxyl signal, according to the Nuclear Overhauser Effect (NOE) measurements [59]. In order to create the disperse dye 14, hydrazine hydrate 4 refluxed with compound 12 [60]. When compound 11 was combined with diazonium salt 2 in the presence of ethyl alcohol/sodium acetate, a high yield of hydrazone 13\u201485%, was produced. In order to help construct the structure of 13, NOE experiments were conducted. The results demonstrated that irradiating the NH signal at 12.1 ppm induced an amplification of the aryl proton resonances at 7.39 and 6.80 ppm (Scheme 2) [60]. Hydrazone 13 and hydrazine hydrate were combined to create the disperse dye 15 by refluxing the mixture for four hours while adding ethanol as a solvent. According to NOE difference measurements, irradiation of the NH signal at 11.94 ppm corresponding to compound 15 boosted the methyl proton signal at 2.36 ppm. Through refluxing for an hour in the presence of acetic acid and sodium acetate, dyes 14 or 15 easily condensed with the enaminones 8a\u2013d to generate disperse dyes 16a\u2013d or 16f\u2013h (Scheme 2) [60]. It is well known that dye 22 was created by combining different types of diazonium chloride 21 with diketones 23 to create substituted arylazodiketones 24, which may then\nbe condensed with cyanoacetamide derivatives 25 using either a traditional heating\nmethod or a microwave heating method [67\u201371]. (Scheme 3).\nOn the other hand, the first reaction method for the synthesis of these azo dyes uti-\nlized the interaction between diazonium chloride and pyridones. We described a three-\ncomponent condensation of methyl propionylacetate 17 as -ketoesters, ethyl cyanoace-\ntates 1 and ethyl amines 18 to generate pyridine 19 in 2014 [61] by utilizing microwave\nirradiation at 160 \u00b0C for 20 min. It is important to note that in 2013 [57], we created com-\npound 19 by heating it traditionally for 6 h. Two tautomeric forms, 19 and 20, of this com-\npound readily equilibrated in solution (Scheme 3).\nBased on X-ray crystallographic structure determination, pyridine 19 could be com-\nbined with different diazonium salts 21 to cr ate the disperse dyes 22a\u2013i that exist in the\nhydrazone tautomeric form, as shown in Scheme 3.

The Kubelka\u2013Munk equation was used to perform K/S [1,21].\nK/S = (1\u2212 R)2 2R \u2212 (1\u2212 R0) 2\n2R0\nwhere R is the decimal fraction of the reflectance of the dyed fabric; R0 is the decimal fraction of the reflectance of the not dyed fabric; K is the absorption coefficient; and S is the scattering coefficient. The dyes have a good affinity for polyester materials at the stated temperatures of 130 \u25e6C, as shown by the color strength values K/S listed in Table 1, giving it brilliant hues. In order to treat the dyeing baths, we decided to reuse the dye bath from the previous study and extend the dyeing time from 60 to 90 min without adding any new dye. It is difficult for the human eye to distinguish the dye\u2019s color constancy after the dye bath was reused. Additionally, it is evident from the results that the color strength K/S values for the initial dyeing process were 2.12, 3.79, 5.95, 5.81, 4.64 and 4.73, and the K/S values for the subsequent dyeing bath process were 1.67, 3.56, 5.47, 3.49, 3.54 and 3.95. After comparing the K/S values of the two methods, we discovered that the K/S for the second dyeing process had reuse rates of 78.77%, 93.93%, 91.93%, 60.06%, 6.29 and 83.5%. Table 1 makes it very evident that dye 16d yields far stronger colors than dyes 16a\u2013c and 16h. Polyester fabrics were dyed using compounds 22a\u2013i, 26a, 26b and 28a\u2013d at a high pressure, high temperature and 2% shade.\nPolymers 2022, 14, 3966 10 of 23\nThe materials were colored in a variety of hues, from yellow to violet. Following that, the fastness properties of polyester fabrics were used to evaluate the dyeing features of such materials. According to the K/S estimations in Table 1, the 22a\u2013i hues exhibited a significant attraction for polyester materials, and all color strengths were typically positive. The International Commission on Illumination (CIE) established the CIELAB (Color space) psychometric coordinates in 1976, where L* stands for lightness and (C) for chroma. The information in Table 2 shows that almost all colored polyester fabrics conveyed a similar hue when the dye\u2019s hue was expressed as (h) values. The positive estimates of b* showed that the dyed polyester materials\u2019color hues shifted in a reddish direction [61].\n* Fabrics: bleached 100%polyester fabric (149 g/m2) were supplied by El-Mahalla El-Kobra Company. The fabrics were scoured in an aqueous solution with a liquor ratioof 1:50 containing 2 g/L nonionic detergent solution (Hostapal, Clariant) and 2 g/L Na2 CO3 at 50 \u25e6C for 30 min to remove impurities, then rinsed thoroughly in cold tap water and dried at room temperature.Fabric samples (2 g) were introduced into a flask containing a dye bath of 2% (owf) dye shade and Matexil DA-N (supplied by ICI Company, UK) as a dispersing agent (1 g/L) at 130 \u25e6C with a 1:20 liquor ratio; during dye bath preparation, the dye was mixed with a few drops of DMF and then mixed with the dispersing agent, and water was added to prepare a homogeneous dispersion of the dye. The pH was adjusted to 4.5 by using acetic acid. The dyeing process was carried out in a microwave oven (Discover [80-mL vessel], CEM) or in a laboratory dyeing machine (Atlas Linitest Plus) for an hour. At the end of the dyeing process, the dyed samples were removed, rinsed in warm water, and subjected to reduction clearing in a solution comprising 2 g l1 of sodium hydrosulphite and 2g/L of sodium hydroxide (caustic soda) for 10 min at 60 \u25e6C, with a liquor ratio of 1:40, and the reduction-cleared sample was rinsed thoroughly in water. After rinsing well in cold water and being neutralized with 1 g/L of acetic acid for 5 min at 40 \u25e6C, the dyed samples were removed, rinsed in tap water and allowed to dry in the open air. Conventional dyeing: Samples of 100% polyester texture were placed into a container containing 2% disperse dyes 1 or 2 shade, dispersing agent Matexil DA-N, carrier Tanavol EP 2007 at different conventional dyeing temperatures of 80 \u25e6C or 100 \u25e6C for 1 h. We continued the dyeing method as explained above. Ultrasonic dyeing: Samples of 100% polyester texture were placed into a container containing2% disperse dyes 1 or 2 shade, dispersing agent Matexil DA-N, carrier Tanavol EP 2007 at an 80 \u25e6C coloring temperature and a coloring time of 1 h utilizing sonic force level 500 W with wavelength132 kHz (thermostated CREST benchtop 575 HT ultrasonic). The dissolved dye in a few drops of DMF (dimethylformamide) was assorted with Matexil DA-N, then, water was added with liquor ratio 1:50 at pH of 4.5. After the dyeing process, the colored samples were subjected to a reduction clearing process for 15 min at 60 \u25e6C.\nThe total color difference \u2206E was measured by using an UltraScan Pro (Hunter Lab, Reston, VA, USA) 10\u25e6 observer with D65 illuminant, d/2 viewing geometry and measurement area of 2 mm. The total color difference \u2206E* between the sample and the standard was calculated using the following equation:\n\u2206E\u2217 = \u221a (\u2206L\u2217)2 + (\u2206a\u2217)2 + (\u2206b\u2217)2\nwhere \u2206L*, \u2206a* and \u2206b* are the derivatives of corresponding parameters, respectively The hues 22e\u2013g were lighter and brighter than the 22b\u2013d because electron-donating groups were included into the benzene ring, which decreased brightness, while electron withdrawing groups improved lightness and brightness.\nPolymers 2022, 14, 3966 11 of 23"

These results show that the dye uptake of fabrics colored at high temperatures was greater than that of materials dyed at low temperatures by 309% and 265%, respectively. Additionally, the K/S values for dyes 26a and 26b were 17.59, 16.69, and 12.21 and 8.97, respectively, for materials colored at high and low temperatures. These results show that the dye uptake of the materials dyed at high temperatures was more than that of low temperature dyeing by 144% and 186%, respectively. According to the results, high temperature dyeing is an environmentally safe technique since it can lessen the pollution load in colored dye effluents, which would otherwise have a negative impact on the environment. Furthermore, as the rate of dye penetration into the filament increased, the pressure increased along with the dyed fabrics at high temperatures. The kinetic energy of the dye molecules may be increased by the temperature, and the temperature may also cause the polyester fibers to inflate, increasing the dyeing rate relative to low temperature dyeing. According to Table 2\u2032s findings, the K/S value for dyeing by ultrasound at 80 \u25e6C is 9.07, while for dyeing by the traditional method at 100 \u25e6C, it is 4.47. This means that the first approach using ultrasound is superior to the traditional method by 102.9% for the disperse dye 22h [1]."

The information in Table 3 demonstrates that the color fastness characteristics of polyester textiles dyed with dyes 5, 7, 9a\u2013d, 14, 15, 16a\u2013h, 22a\u2013i, 26a\u2013b and 28a\u2013d were measured. The results for dyed polyester fabrics dyed with dyes 5, 7, and 9a\u2013d are shown in Table 3, where the ratings for color fastness to light and washing were good and very good and the rating for color fastness to perspiration was excellent [60]. Data obtained by testing the color fastness characteristics of polyester fabrics colored with dyes 14, 15, and 16a\u2013h are shown in Table 3. With the exception of dye 16d, all of the tested dyes had outstanding washing and perspiration fastness, according to the fastness values listed in Table 3. The polyester colored materials\u2019 light fastness showed moderate fastness. The type of substituents in the diazonium component had a considerable impact on the light fastness. As a result, this moiety\u2019s fading rate should increase for electron-donating groups, whereas it should decrease for electron-withdrawing groups. The results (Table 3) show that the inclusion of a methyl group in dyes 16b and 16g produced a reduction in light fastness to 3; our idea is consistent with these findings. The chlorine atom in the dyes 16c and 16h, on the other hand, was linked to an increase in light fastness to 4 and 6, respectively [61]. Data acquired by assessing the color fastness characteristics of polyester fabrics dyed with dyes 22a\u2013i are displayed in Table 3 as fastness data. The grades for fastness are listed in Table 3, which demonstrates very good levels of fastness for perspiration and outstanding levels of fastness for washing.

To gain the self-cleaning properties of nano ZnO or TiO2 particles, the photodegradation of methyl red and methylene blue adsorbed on nano ZnO or TiO2 treated polyester fabrics was explored (Table 7).\n* Photo-stimulated color removal on polyester: 60 \u00b5L methyl red or methylene blue was marked on both posttreated ZnO or TiO2 nanoparticles (0.5\u20132.5% w.o.ffor ZnO and 1\u20135% w.o.f for TiO2)-treated polyester and the untreated fabrics. The polyester fabrics were illuminated through exposure to an ultraviolet lamp for 24 h for ZnO and 12 h forTiO2.\nAfter 24 and 12 h of UV exposure, Table 7 displays the results of methyl red and methylene blue stains on polyester fabrics treated with ZnO or TiO2 NPs. For polyester fabrics treated with ZnO or TiO2 NPs, a partial discoloration of methyl red and methylene blue stains brought on by ultraviolet radiation was seen. When polyester fabric is treated with ZnO or TiO2 NPs, thin layers of ZnO or TiO2 nanoparticles develop, increasing the fabric\u2019s hydrophobic qualities. A hydrophobic surface stops dirt from adhering, keeping the polyester surface clean at all times. The results showed that the highest rates of photodegradation on the surface were 60\u201370% for methyl red stains treated with ZnO NPs after 24 h and 60\u201380% after 12 h for methylene blue stains treated with TiO2 NPs (Table 7).\nPolymers 2022, 14, 3966 19 of 23"

It is known that cytotoxicity is one of the most important markers of biological evaluation in laboratory tests, so we presented two examples of new disperse dyes as one of the examples of in vitro cytotoxicity examination.We showed that these dyes possess anticancer activities against some common cancers such as lung, breast, liver and colon cancer. The added value of these new disperse dyes was also discussed and presented by showing the biological activity and clarifying that these dyes have a great biological activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, as well as various\nPolymers 2022, 14, 3966 20 of 23\nfungi and yeasts. It is worth noting here that polyester fabrics dyed with these dyes had biological activity, which makes these fabrics able to be used in many medical activities. We presented and discussed the use of ultrasound energy to dye polyester fabrics, as it gave a high color strength compared to traditional dyeing methods. In this review, we also discussed the methods of treating polyester fabrics with nano-zinc oxide or nano-titanium dioxide and presented the advantages of this strategy in endowing the dyed polyester fabrics with multiple functions, such as self-cleaning property, maximizing light fastness property and maximizing antimicrobial activities.\nAuthor Contributions: Writing\u2014review and editing, A.M.A.-E. and M.A.E.-A.
