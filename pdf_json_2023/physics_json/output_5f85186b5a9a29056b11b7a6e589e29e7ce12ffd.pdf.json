    "abstractText": "In this research, a novel nanomagnetic tetra-azamacrocyclic Schiff base complex of copper(II) was produced via a post-synthetic surface modification of an Fe3O4 surface by a silane-coupling agent that contains acetylacetone functionalities at the end of its chain. Moreover, the target Cu complex that involves a tetradentate Schiff base ligand was obtained from a template reaction with ophenylenediamine and Cu(NO3)2$3H2O. Furthermore, the prepared complex was nominated as [Fe3O4@TAM-Schiff-base-Cu ]. The Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis indicates the presence of a Schiff-base-Cu complex in the catalyst. X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and TGA analysis reveal that approximately 6\u20137% of the target catalyst comprises hydrocarbon moieties. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images demonstrate the presence of uniformly shaped particles, nearly spherical in nature, with sizes ranging from 9 to 18 nm. [Fe3O4@TAMSchiff-base-Cu] was applied as a catalyst for the click synthesis of a diverse range of 5-substituted-1Htetrazoles in PEG-400 as a green medium. Regarding the electrical properties of the Cu(II) complex, the presence of a tetra-aza (N4 donor) macrocyclic Schiff base as an N-rich ligand was reasonable \u2013 leading to its excellent capacity to catalyze these organic transformations. Finally, the high magnetization value (44.92 emu g\u22121) of [Fe3O4@TAM-Schiff-base-Cu ] enables its recycling at least four times without compromising the catalytic efficiency.",

Moreover, the target Cu complex that\ninvolves a tetradentate Schiff base ligand was obtained from a template reaction with o-\nphenylenediamine and Cu(NO3)2$3H2O. Furthermore, the prepared complex was nominated as [Fe3O4@TAM-Schiff-base-Cu (II)]. The Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) analysis indicates the presence of a Schiff-base-Cu complex in the catalyst. X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and TGA analysis reveal that\napproximately 6\u20137% of the target catalyst comprises hydrocarbon moieties. The scanning electron\nmicroscope (SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images demonstrate the presence of\nuniformly shaped particles, nearly spherical in nature, with sizes ranging from 9 to 18 nm. [Fe3O4@TAMSchiff-base-Cu(II)] was applied as a catalyst for the click synthesis of a diverse range of 5-substituted-1H-\ntetrazoles in PEG-400 as a green medium. Regarding the electrical properties of the Cu(II) complex, the\npresence of a tetra-aza (N4 donor) macrocyclic Schiff base as an N-rich ligand was reasonable \u2013 leading to its excellent capacity to catalyze these organic transformations. Finally, the high magnetization value (44.92 emu g\u22121) of [Fe3O4@TAM-Schiff-base-Cu (II)] enables its recycling at least four times without compromising the catalytic efficiency."

A. Bladin in 1885, are made of a doubly unsaturated ve-membered ring containing four nitrogen atoms and one carbon atom, known as the greatest quantity of nitrogen that may be found in a stable heterocyclic ring.6,7 It is possible for these compounds to exist in a wide variety of tautomeric forms, as well as anions and cations, such as mono- and di-substituted NH tetrazole derivatives.8 In this regard, recent reviews have shown that tetrazole-containing molecules can be prepared from the catalytic reactions of amines, amides, aldoximes, aldehydes, and nitriles.9\u201315 The most common method is to react sodium azide as the nitrogen\nce, Ilam University, P.O.

Generally, the immobilization of transition metals on high-surface-area materials, such as nanomaterials, has been documented.17,23,24 However, these heterogenized catalysts suffer from sluggish reaction rates and severe mass-transfer limitations, in addition to active species leaching during reactions. Recently, it has been demonstrated that modifying and functionalizing nanomaterials with organic ligands and complexes via covalent or noncovalent interactions is an alternative and efficient method to produce hybrid catalysts.25,26\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Aerwards, the corresponding Cu(II) Schiff base complex was synthesized using the template approach, and then it was applied as a promoter to assist the sustainable synthesis of 5-substituted-1H-tetrazole derivatives in PEG-400 as a greener alternative to the traditional solvents.

Furthermore, multiple degradation stages are depicted in Fig. 3. The evaporation of moisture, water and organic solvents that are physically adsorbed on the prepared nanocomposite caused the two initial weight losses of 2.66% below 160 \u00b0C.54 Disintegration of the supported Schiff base\u2013copper complex causes the next weight loss in the range of 162\u2013400 \u00b0C, which is about 6.78%. Signicantly, DTG max was detected at 335.69 \u00b0C. The physical changes, such as fusion, dehydration reactions and phase crystalline change (oxidation of Fe3O4 to Fe2O3 (hematite) and the formation of SiO2 metal oxide), are the causes of the two weight gains in the temperature range of 400 to 648 \u00b0C. According to the TGA-DTG results, the [Fe3O4@TAMSchiff-base-Cu(II)] complex has an excellent thermal stability, which is an efficient characteristic for catalysis at high temperatures.\nEnergy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDAX) and inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectroscopy (ICP-OES)\nThe EDAX analysis conrmed the presence of all the expected elements in the [Fe3O4@TAM-Schiff-base-Cu\n(II)] complex composition. As shown in Fig. 4, the presence of iron and oxygen peaks refers to key elements of the Fe3O4 MNPs. In addition, the presence of a silicon peak affirms the successful graing of the 3- (3-trimethoxysilylpropyl)acetylacetone on Fe3O4 and the construction of Fe3O4@SiO2@sil-acac MNPs. As shown in Fig. 4, the presence of key elements, such as carbon, nitrogen, and copper, affirms that the template reaction of Fe3O4@SiO2@silacac MNPs with o-phenylenediamine and copper salt leads to the successful formation of the target Cu(II) Schiff base complex. Furthermore, the exact amount of copper in the [Fe3O4@TAMSchiff-base-Cu(II)] complex was determined to be 0.076 mmol g\u22121 through the utilization of ICP-OES methodology.\nWavelength dispersive X-ray analysis (WDS)\nThe elemental mapping analysis of the [Fe3O4@TAM-Schiff-baseCu(II)] complex is shown in Fig. 5.

As can be seen in these photograms, there is a good agreement between the distribution patterns of these elements, which demonstrated that the imine groups of the TAM-Schiff-base ligand serve as donor nitrogen atoms for the coordination of Cu(II) ions. The uniform dispersion of copper as the active component in this heterogeneous catalyst is expected to result in an increase in the number of active sites. This, in turn, is anticipated to enhance the accessibility of reactants and, consequently, lead to a higher production rate of organic products."

In most cases, the reaction was not completed. Signicantly, the best result was found with the PEG-400 solvent and, accordingly, it was selected as the optimal solvent. Finally, due to the versatile role of temperature on this transformation, we analyzed the effectiveness of it in various experimental conditions. It was observed that, when the reaction mixture was stirred at an elevated temperature (100 \u00b0C), the yield dropped while the reaction time increased to 170 min.

Moreover, this is because of the fact that the increment of the negative charge on the nitrile group's carbon reduces the electrophilicity, which slows down their reaction with the N3 \u2212 agent. It is worth mentioning that the para substituent only contributes inductive and resonance effects whereas in the ortho-substituted one there is a strict hindrance too. Notably, aliphatic nitriles and Knoevenagel adducts, such as malononitrile, acetonitrile and 2-benzylmalononitrile, do not react with sodium azide, displaying no complementary products. These investigations show a high degree of selectivity for aromatic nitriles, which can be efficiently involved in the reaction and conversion to their corresponding tetrazole derivatives in presence of the [Fe3O4@TAM-Schiff-base-Cu\n(II)] complex, while the aliphatic C^N groups in the molecule will remain intact. Also, the nanocatalyst provides a good homoselectivity (Scheme 2) in dicyano-functional benzonitriles, such as phthalonitrile (Table 2, entry 12), for the synthesis of the corresponding tetrazoles (Scheme 3)."
