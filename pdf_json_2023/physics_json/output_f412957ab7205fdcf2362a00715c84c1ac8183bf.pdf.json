    "abstractText": "Background The forming, blending, and characterization of materials at a size of one billionth of a meter or less is referred to as nanotechnology. The objective of the current study was to synthesize ecologically friendly gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) from Gymnosporia montana L. (G. montana) leaf extract, characterize them, assess their interaction with different types of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), and investigate their antioxidant and toxic capabilities. Results The biosynthesized AuNPs presence was validated by a color change from yellow to reddish pink as well as using UV\u2013visible spectrophotometer. Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis showed the presence of phytoconstituents like, alcohols, phenols, and nitro compounds responsible for the reduction of AuNPs. Zeta sizer and zeta potential of 559.6 d. nm and \u2212 4.5 mV, respectively, demonstrated potential stability. With an average size between 10 and 50 nm, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM), revealed the crystalline formation of AuNPs. Surface topology with 3D characterization, irregular spherical shape, and size with 6.48 nm of AuNPs was determined with the help of an atomic force microscope (AFM). AuNPs with some irregular and spherical shapes, and sizes between 2 and 20 nm, were revealed by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) investigation. Shifts in the spectrum were visible when the bioavailability of AuNPs with calfthymus DNA (CT-DNA) and Herring sperm DNA (HS-DNA) was tested. Additionally, the DNA nicking assay\u2019s interaction with pBR322 DNA confirmed its physiochemical and antioxidant properties. The same was also found by using a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay, which showed a 70\u201380% inhibition rate. Finally, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay revealed that viability decreased with increasing dosage, going from 77.74 to 46.99% on MCF-7 cell line. Conclusion Synthesizing AuNPs through biogenic processes and adopting G. montana for the first time revealed potential DNA interaction, antioxidant, and cytotoxicity capabilities. Thus, opening new possibilities in the turf of therapeutics as well as in other areas.",

Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy analysis showed the presence of phytoconstituents like, alcohols, phenols, and nitro compounds responsible for the reduction of AuNPs. Zeta sizer and zeta potential of 559.6 d. nm and \u2212 4.5 mV, respectively, demonstrated potential stability. With an average size between 10 and 50 nm, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and high-resolution transmission electron microscope (HR-TEM), revealed the crystalline formation of AuNPs. Surface topology with 3D characterization, irregular spherical shape, and size with 6.48 nm of AuNPs was determined with the help of an atomic force microscope (AFM). AuNPs with some irregular and spherical shapes, and sizes between 2 and 20 nm, were revealed by field emission scanning electron microscope (FESEM) investigation. Shifts in the spectrum were visible when the bioavailability of AuNPs with calfthymus DNA (CT-DNA) and Herring sperm DNA (HS-DNA) was tested. Additionally, the DNA nicking assay\u2019s interaction with pBR322 DNA confirmed its physiochemical and antioxidant properties. The same was also found by using a 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) assay, which showed a 70\u201380% inhibition rate. Finally, 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-2H-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay revealed that viability decreased with increasing dosage, going from 77.74 to 46.99% on MCF-7 cell line.\nConclusion Synthesizing AuNPs through biogenic processes and adopting G. montana for the first time revealed potential DNA interaction, antioxidant, and cytotoxicity capabilities. Thus, opening new possibilities in the turf of therapeutics as well as in other areas.\nKeywords Gold nanoparticles, Gymnosporia montana L., Spectroscopy, DNA, Cytotoxicity\n*Correspondence: Gaurang M.

            "text": "Nanotechnology and nanoscience are involved in the blending, forming, and characterization of materials and devices whose nanoscopic functional organization, in at least one dimension, is on the nanometer scale or one billionth of a meter [1, 2]. Their distinct size, shape, and larger surface area-to-volume ratio-dependent properties make these materials essential and predominant in many areas of humankind. Metal nanoparticles, predominantly gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), have drawn researchers\u2019 attention more and more throughout the past century and are now widely used in magnetic separation, targeted drug delivery, deoxyribonucleic acid labeling, preconcentration of target analytes, and vehicles for gene and drug delivery, but more significantly, diagnostic imaging due to its ability to interact with light via surface plasmon resonance (SPR), oxidation resistance, and biocompatibility qualities [3\u20136]. With the two major strategies, top-down and bottomup nanotechnology conception can be facilitated. The\nGraphical Abstract\ntop-down approach involves processing larger things (100\u20131000\u00a0 nm) as building blocks to create nanoscale structures (10\u2013100\u00a0 nm) [7], as opposed to the bottomup approach, which uses nanotechnology to make larger nanoparticles (NPs) (10\u2013100\u00a0 nm) from smaller (0.1\u2013 10\u00a0nm) building blocks like atoms and molecules [8, 9].\nPhysical, chemical, and biological techniques can be used to produce these NPs from various routes. NPs that have been chemically created are hazardous to living things, which goes against their naturally economical and environmentally favorable nature [10]. Therefore, mounting a greener synthetic approach to produce NPs utilizing biological resources provides a distinctive propitious feature in investigation due to its effectiveness in synthesizing safe compounds [11]. Green substrates such as fungus [12], enzymes [13], microbes [14], algae [15], plants [16], etc. were reportedly successful in the production of AuNPs. However, plant-based synthesis is often risk-free, quick, and operates under ideal room conditions without the need for extreme physical requirements [17]. The selection of appropriate types of protecting agent and concentration, together with synthesis conditions such as pH, temperature, stirring, etc., and the application of optimum reduction and agitation methods may influence the form and size of the AuNPs [18].\nGymnosporia montana L. (G. montana) commonly known as Viklo occurs throughout the arid, dry areas of India and is traditionally claimed to be useful in various ailments [19]. G. montana is a tall shrub with young branches often spiny, bearing leaves, and flowers. Leaves are gray, leathery, obovate, blunt, and measuring 0.5\u2013 4.5 \u00d7 0.4\u20132\u00a0cm. In addition to evaluating its leaf extract\u2019s potential for anti-inflammatory and hepatoprotective action, researchers have also looked at its historical claims of use in the treatment of inflammation, gastrointestinal disorders, ulcers, and jaundice [19]. The principle phytoconstituents of G. montana leaves include phenols, alkaloids, flavonoids, tannins, and saponin [20]. Thus, due to the presence of these potential phytoconstituents, the G. montana leaf extract exhibits anti-oxidant, anti-inflammatory, and anti-cancer properties [21]. Thus further, it can be introduced into the gold mixture throughout the NPs fabrication process for the formation of AuNPs.\nBiological genetic factory, i.e., deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), has been a focus of many multidisciplinary research efforts involving nanotechnology. AuNPs are more selective for single-stranded DNA (ss-DNA) binding. Many studies have concluded that electrostatic forces between the anionic DNA strands and the negatively charged surfaces of AuNPs are less favorable for doublestranded DNA (ds-DNA) binding [22, 23]. Henceforth, spectroscopic interactions between the AuNPs produced by G. montana with calf-thymus (CT-DNA or ds-DNA)\nand Herring fish sperm (HS-DNA or ss-DNA) DNA can be performed. DNA nicking assay based on Fenton\u2019s reaction can be applied to analyze the interaction of AuNPs with pBR322 DNA to evaluate the antioxidant strength of the AuNPs. The technique mimics the in\u00a0vivo biological situation, by producing hydroxyl free radicals from endogenous entities like intracellular iron [24, 25]. Moreover, in\u00a0vitro chemical antioxidant assay, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), can also be carried out for further investigation. Thus, this parameter will assist us in researching and developing nanoparticle-based DNAbinding technology due to its special size and optical characteristics [26].\nAlthough AuNPs have shown potential in a variety of biological applications, a determination of their biosafety is necessary before they can be used more widely [27]. As there is an increasing need to assess how these materials may affect human health and to learn more about their toxicity and biocompatibility, cytotoxicity in\u00a0vitro assays like MTT (3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl2H-tetrazolium bromide) has emerged as the gold standard for determining cell viability and proliferation [28].\nBy following the same paradigm, we have strained the experiment of synthesizing AuNPs through a biogenic process. To the best of our knowledge, no research using G. montana in the manufacture of AuNPs has been published. Here, we used hydrogen tetrachloroaurate (III) trihydrate (HAuCl4 \u00b7 3H2O) and aqueous leaf extract of G. montana to demonstrate the biosynthesis, characterization, and biological application of AuNPs."

FTIR spectroscopy was used to classify the biomolecules according to\ntheir functional groups, which aided in the stabilization and reduction of the generated AuNPs [46]. The changes in spectral bands resulting from the bio-reduction of HAuCl4 3H2O to AuNPs using G. montana leaf extract were evident in Fig.\u00a0 4a and b. The observed shifts were quite significant, with the band at 3348\u00a0 cm\u22121 shifting to 3424.23\u00a0 cm\u22121, and a minor shift from 1635.28 to 1637.34\u00a0 cm\u22121. Various functional groups were identified in the AuNPs, such as alkene vibrations (C\u2013H and -C = C- stretching), nitro compounds (N\u2013O stretching), and phenols/alcohols (O\u2013H stretching). These findings were supported by Folorunso et\u00a0al., Sett et\u00a0al., and Xin lee et\u00a0al. [6, 16, 47, 48], who also reported similar results.\nThe particle size of the AuNPs was determined to be 559.6 d. nm (Fig.\u00a0 5) utilizing zeta sizer technique since the correct size and charge are important components of NPs synthesis. Here, large concentrations of HAuCl4 \u00d7 3H2O and/or reducing metabolites caused an increase in NP size, which in turn caused the particles to clump together as evenly specified in Ali et\u00a0 al. 2016 [49]. Zeta potential analysis was used to determine the AuNPs\u2019 long-term stability and surface charge [50]. The generated AuNPs had a zeta potential of \u2212 4.5\u00a0 mV (Fig.\u00a06). While the positive charge indicates the possibility for aggregation and instability, the negative behavior demonstrates the existence of large electric charges on the particle surfaces, which inhibit impending agglomeration and provide stability [51]. According to Fig.\u00a07, the XRD pattern is in agreement with earlier reports about the produced AuNPs [52] to be crystalline in character, with a considerably stronger peak at 38.1459\u00b0 indicating the FCC gold structure. Inter planar distance calculated from Bragg\u2019s law was observed at 0.237\u00a0nm which agrees with HR-TEM results. Using the Scherrer equation, the mean crystalline size of AuNPs was ranging between 10 and 50\u00a0 nm [40], and the same was confirmed from the\ndata analyzed from HR-TEM images (Fig.\u00a011a\u2013e), which showed polydispersity, majorly containing spherical and subsidiarily hexagonal shape. The 2D and 3D topography of the AuNPs AFM analysis, with a diameter of 6.48\u00a0nm, is shown in Fig.\u00a08a and b, demonstrating that NPs have a larger surface area [52]. FESEM image showed majorly spherical-shaped AuNPs (Fig.\u00a0 9). According to the results, the particle size ranged between 10 and 20\u00a0nm. In this case, the components on the NP\u2019s surface that serve as a capping agent can be the cause of the AuNPs\u2019 aggregation [53].\nSpectroscopy is a useful tool for determining how DNA interacts with NPs [54, 55]. Chromism is a spectral characteristic that influences the stability of DNA. Hypochromic and bathochromic complexes indicate that the DNA is bound by electrostatic influence or intercalation, which can stabilize the DNA structure, whereas hyperchromic complexes show that the DNA\u2019s secondary structure has been disrupted [56, 57]. CT-DNA and HS-DNA interaction with G. montana synthesized AuNPs resulted in bathochromic and hypochromic shifts (Fig.\u00a0 12), indicating intercalation property due to a decrease in the energy gap between the highest (HOMO) and the lowest (LUMO) molecular orbitals [58] and non-covalent intercalative binding of the compound to DNA helix, due to strong stacking interaction between the aromatic chromophore of the compound and base pairs of the DNA, respectively [59].\nAntioxidant substances can impede the oxidation chain at multiple points in the process, either via chelating catalyst-active metals or by radical-chain breaking. For biologically in\u00a0 vivo antioxidant compounds, an in\u00a0 vitro DNA nicking assay based on the Fenton reagent was carried out. As stated in Leba et. al. [60], DNA nicking assays have been developed because damage to the genome is the primary cause of disorders\nlike cancer and neurological illness [61\u201363]. With incubation at 37\u00a0 \u00b0C for 60 and 90\u00a0 min, respectively, the AuNPs produced from G. montana in Fenton reagent were able to maintain the pBR322 DNA forms I and II. But when the incubation time lengthened, it split the DNA into forms II and III (Fig.\u00a0 13). Additionally, because G. montana-generated AuNPs can preserve the native form of pBR322, they can be employed as a disease-curing drug. A similar investigation with CPTH (calix [4] pyrrole tetrahydrazide)-AuNPs was carried out by Kongor et\u00a0al. [64].\nBesides, to the in\u00a0 vitro DNA nicking experiment for genomic agents, the DPPH in\u00a0 vitro chemical assay was carried out to assess the overall antioxidant capability of natural products [65\u201367]. Oxygen interactions with specific molecules can result in the formation of free radicals. As a result, it constantly tries to form stable bonds by obtaining or losing an unpaired electron.\nGold, with its ability to easily gain or lose electrons and modify existing oxidation states, has the potential to strengthen bonds. In accordance with Soshnikova et\u00a0 al., higher doses of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) have been shown to increase their scavenging activity [68]. When comparing the antioxidant activity of G. montana leaf extract to the positive control (ascorbic acid), it was observed that ascorbic acid exhibited a percentage inhibition ranging from 75.97 to 91.06% across concentrations of 100\u20131000\u00a0 \u03bcg/ml. In contrast, G. montana leaf extract showed non-significant results (ns) in relation to ascorbic acid at concentrations ranging from 200 to 600\u00a0 \u03bcg/ml. However, at approximately 800\u00a0 \u03bcg/ml concentration, both ascorbic acid and G. montana displayed a significant value of p < 0.01 (**) indicating similar scavenging activity against reactive oxygen species. Figure\u00a014 also indicates that concentrations above 800\u00a0 \u03bcg/ml for both G. montana and AuNPs exhibited increased antioxidant activity, with significant values of p < 0.001 (***). Specifically, the inhibition percentages rose from 73.18 to 83.37% for AuNPs and from 74.16 to 88.96% for G. montana leaf extract. To summarize, G. montana leaf extract demonstrated comparable antioxidant activity to the positive control (ascorbic acid) at around 800\u00a0\u03bcg/ml concentration, as indicated by the significant p-value. Moreover, concentrations exceeding 800\u00a0\u03bcg/ml for both G. montana and AuNPs showed enhanced antioxidant activity, with statistically significant results. The IC50 values obtained from the DPPH radical scavenging activity indicated that the concentration of 50% of the DPPH radicals were scavenged by each substance. Thus, ascorbic acid exhibited the highest antioxidant activity, followed by G. montana and AuNPs. These findings suggest the potential of these substances as DPPH scavengers and provide insight into their relative antioxidant capabilities.\nThe MTT assay results presented in Fig.\u00a015, indicated that both AuNPs coated with G. montana leaf extract showed a concentration-dependent decrease in cell viability when exposed to increasing concentrations [69]. These findings highlight the potential cytotoxic effects of higher concentrations of AuNPs on MCF-7 cell line."

The green technique is primarily straightforward to use and is ecologically benign for controlling the size and form of the NPs. AuNP diverse characterization revealed their distinctive optical and SPR properties and surface chemistry, which stated their potentiality in the fields of chemistry, biology, and physics. Additionally, biogenic interactions exhibited stability, intercalative, and antioxidant properties that had outstanding biocompatibility and bioavailability with physiologically active organic molecules. The spectrum of AuNP toxicity suggests appropriate use in a variety of medical specialties in the future. It may also be used for in silico and in\u00a0vivo experiments for anticancer, gene, or drug delivery agents since the foundation of the G. montana-manufactured AuNPs demonstrated significant results.\nAbbreviations \u00b0C Celsius \u00b5g Microgram \u00b5l Microliter \u00b5M Micromolar \u00b5g/ml Microgram per milliliter mL\u22121 Milli reciprocal liter M Molar mA Milliampere V Volt kV Kilovolt mV Millivolt cm Centimeter cm\u22121 Reciprocal centimeter cm\u22121 M\u22121 Reciprocal centimeter reciprocal meter d.
