1. **Investigate the impact of climate change on the distribution and severity of early blight and late blight diseases.** As the climate continues to change, it is important to understand how these diseases may be affected. This information can be used to develop strategies to mitigate the impact of these diseases on crop production.


2. **Develop new methods for detecting and diagnosing early blight and late blight diseases.** Early detection and diagnosis of these diseases are essential for effective management. New methods that are more rapid, accurate, and cost-effective would be valuable tools for growers and plant pathologists.


3. **Evaluate the efficacy of new fungicides and other control measures for early blight and late blight diseases.** As new fungicides and other control measures are developed, it is important to evaluate their efficacy against these diseases. This information can be used to make informed decisions about the best way to manage these diseases in different situations.


4. **Study the genetic diversity of Alternaria solani and Phytophthora infestans populations.** Understanding the genetic diversity of these pathogens is important for developing effective management strategies. This information can be used to identify new sources of resistance in host plants and to develop more targeted fungicides.


5. **Investigate the role of beneficial microorganisms in the suppression of early blight and late blight diseases.** Beneficial microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi, can play a role in suppressing plant diseases. Research in this area could lead to the development of new biocontrol agents for these diseases.
