E-mail: jiangtz@nlpr.ia.ac.cn16 17 18 Abstract19 Biological sample clearing techniques are a potent tool for three-dimensional20 biological imaging, among which delipidation is an essential step in achieving high-quality21 biological sample transparency. Detergents and organic solvents can both be used for22 lipids removal. The former has been extensively investigated in biological sample clearing,23 while the delipidation process based on organic solvents remains to be further elucidated.24 Recently, organic solvents also served as a delipidation reagent in aqueous-based25 clearing methods and exhibited very fast clearing speed. To explain the high efficiency of26 organic solvents, we described the delipidation process of both detergents and organic27 solvents with a simple diffusion model, we proposed a possible mechanism of the28 delipidation process of water-miscible polar organic solvents based on the clearing results29 of brain samples. Both our results and model revealed that polar or non-polar organic30 solvents with a certain molecular structure could achieve a much faster clearing speed31 than detergents which could be a guide for establishing a rapid clearing protocol for32 biological samples with large volumes.33 Introduction34 In the past decade, different biological sample clearing methods have been35 developed to satisfy various volumetric imaging requirements1. All these clearing methods36 can be roughly classified into two groups: one is the hydrophilic method, and another is37 the hydrophobic clearing method. Lipids are strong light scattering substances thus38 delipidation is essential for high-quality clearing1. Traditionally, hydrophilic methods like39 CLARITY2 or CUBIC3 use detergents such as SDS, and Triton X-100 for delipidation.40 However, the detailed delipidation process is still not very clear in organic solvents41\nbased(\u201csolvents-based\u201d in brief) clearing method. Previous studies show that lipophilic42 dyes are not compatible with hydrophobic methods which implies that lipids have been43 removed during their clearing process4. Water-miscible organic solvents(methanol,44 ethanol, tert-butanol, THF, etc. ) may be served as both delipidation and dehydration45 reagents while water-immiscible organic solvents such as DCM can be only used for46 further delipidation in hydrophobic clearing methods5. For example, iDISCO6, BABB7,47 3DISCO5, and uDISCO8 protocols use methanol, ethanol, THF, and tert-butanol(TBA) for48 dehydration and delipidation may also occur during dehydration while DCM was only used49 as a delipidation reagent. Recently, only utilizing the delipidation property of THF and50 combining hydrophilic refractive index matching(RI), Fast3D9 and EZ Clear10 were51 developed as more rapid aqueous clearing protocols compared with traditional52 detergent-based aqueous methods. These results imply that organic solvents such as53 THF have powerful delipidation abilities and are likely faster than detergents-based54 clearing methods.55 Here we aimed at clarifying the delipidation process based on organic solvents and56 why organic solvents with certain structures could realize faster clearing speed than a57 detergent-based solution. Indeed, our results demonstrated that organic solvents exhibit58 much faster delipidation speed than detergent-based recipes and even faster than59 CHAPS-based clearing11 reagent which once helped penetrate and clear the whole60 human brain. To decipher the rapid delipidation process of organic solvents, we used a61 diffusion model to describe the delipidation process of both organic solvents and62 detergents based on our brain sample clearing results, then we presented a new model to63 describe the delipidation process of water-miscible organic solvents. We hypothesized64 that the size of lipids transporting particles in organic solvents is much smaller than that of65 detergents-based delipidation reagents which may be the most important factor that66 affects efficiency. A much smaller transporting particle is less hampered by complex 3D67 biological sample structure and thus is easily washed out from the inside of biological68 samples, especially for the clearing of large samples. The size of lipid transporting69 particles combined with other factors like viscosity, biological sample thickness changes,70 and lipids proportion of transporting particles may jointly explain the delipidation efficiency71 difference between detergents and organic solvents.72 In summary, our results and diffusion model give a clue that organic solvents with73 certain structures such as THF and DCM are much faster delipidation reagents compared74 with detergent-based solutions and are good options for establishing rapid hydrophilic75 clearing protocol or clearing methods for large biological samples or organ.76 Results77 Delipidation-based biological sample clearing methods tend to achieve good78 biological sample transparency as lipids are strong light-scattering substances.79 Delipidation and RI matching are the two main steps in these methods. Detergents and80 organic solvents can both be used for delipidation, here we focused on investigating the81 delipidation process and the mechanism of organic solvents. The degree of biological82 sample transparency was often affected by the degree of delipidation. Thus the final83 biological samples transparency can be served as an indicator for the degree of84 delipidation if only two criteria are satisfied: one is that no delipidation occurs in the RI85\nmatching step, and another is that the RI matching solution itself could not make86 undelipidated biological samples significant transparent. We first eliminated87 solvents-based RI matching liquid in which delipidation may also occur in this step. To88 make biological samples transparent, solutions with certain RI value is essential, among89 various RI matching solution, iohexol-based cocktails (RIMS12, EasyIndex13 eg.),90 antipyrine based cocktail(CUBIC-R14 eg.), m-Xylylenediamine(MXDA15) based91 cocktail(MACS-R215 eg.) were our candidates, however, iohexol is too expensive to test,92 MACS-R2 tend to make undelipidated biological samples transparent due to its powerful93 hyperhydration ability. After confirming that CUBIC-R(+)14 could not make undelipidated94 biological samples transparent(Figure 1B), we adopted CUBIC-R(+) as RI matching95 solution of biological samples delipidated with organic solvents or detergents.96 The delipidation ability of most of our tested organic solvents was better than97 detergent-based hydrophilic clearing solution98\nTo investigate the delipidation mechanism of organic solvents, we compared the99 clearing ability of commonly used aqueous detergent-based delipidation reagents with100 organic solvents under the same condition(Figure 1). We found that apart from 2-propanol,101 nearly all tested organic lipid-extracting solvents outperformed detergent-based solutions,102 especially for the clearance of brain white matter even CHAPS and its analogs like SC,103 SDC-based recipes were less efficient(Figure 1).104 Among all tested solvents, water-miscible solvent THF and water-immiscible solvent105 DCM successfully achieved the clearing of both brain gray and white matter which106 exhibited much more powerful delipidation ability compared with other solvents(Figure 1).107 It seems that THF was slightly better than DCM for white matter clearing(Figure 1).108 However, the clearing ability between THF and DCM still needed to be further tested.109 Apart from the above organic solvents, we also tested the delipidation ability of pure110 ethylene glycol or glycerol, as we expected, they are not efficient(Figure 1).111 An explanation of the delipidation process of both detergents and organic solvents112 delipidation using a diffusion model113 Why delipidation using organic solvents was much faster than that of detergents?114 We assumed three stages of the delipidation process of lipid-extracting solution115 (solvents): dissolution, forming the micelle(optional), and diffusion. The lipids within116 biological samples first dissolve by solution(solvents), then lipids may aggregate into117 micelles, and finally, lipids diffuse out of biological samples. We considered that the118 diffusion stage of delipidation also conformed to Fick\u2019s law(equation[1]) which has been119 used for describing 3D antibody staining16-18.120\n\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd = \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd 2\ufffd [1]121\nWhere:122 \ufffd\ufffd/\ufffd\ufffd represents the rate of change of the solute concentration with respect to time.123 \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd is the effective diffusion coefficient, which characterizes how readily the solute124 diffuses in a particular medium.125 \ufffd 2\ufffd is the Laplacian operator of the solute concentration, representing the gradient126 of concentration.127\nIn the context of delipidation in biological sample clearing, the solute refers to the lipid128 molecules or micelles, and the concentration (\ufffd) represents the lipid concentration within129 the biological samples.130 The equation[1] describes how the lipid-extracting solution (solvent) diffuses into the131 biological samples and interacts with the lipids, causing them to dissolve and diffuse out.132 The rate at which this diffusion process occurs depends on the diffusion coefficient of the133 solvent in the biological samples and the concentration gradient of lipids within the134 biological samples.135 Fick's second law of diffusion and the Stokes-Einstein equation are related through136 the diffusion coefficient (\ufffd) and the properties of the diffusing particles. Fick's second law137 of diffusion, as mentioned earlier, describes the rate of change of solute concentration138 over time in terms of the diffusion coefficient and the concentration gradient. It provides a139 macroscopic description of diffusion in a system. The Stokes-Einstein equation is a140 fundamental relationship that relates the diffusion coefficient of a particle to its size and141 the properties of the surrounding medium.142 Ideally, diffusion constant( \ufffd0 ) can be described by the Stokes-Einstein equation143 which is given below equation:144\n\ufffd0 = \ufffd\ufffd 6\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd [2]145\nWhere:146 \ufffd0is the diffusion coefficient of the particle.147 \ufffd is Boltzmann's constant.148 \ufffd is the temperature.149 \ufffd is the dynamic viscosity of the medium.150 \ufffd is the radius of the diffusing particle.151 The equation suggests that the diffusion coefficient is inversely proportional to the152 size of the particle (radius) and directly proportional to the temperature and the reciprocal153 of the medium's viscosity.154 The relationship between Fick's second law and the Stokes-Einstein equation arises155 when considering diffusion in a system where the diffusing particles are affected by both156 concentration gradients and the properties of the surrounding medium. In the case of157 delipidation in biological samples clearing, the lipid-extracting solution (solvent) acts as158 the medium, and the lipids within the biological samples act as the diffusing particles. The159 equation[2] described the case of the diffusion constant in pure solution(solvent). However,160 lipids transporting particles are not only suffered by the surrounding medium, but also by161 the biological gel mesh, especially for the large particles. Thus the effective diffusion162 constant(\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd) of lipids should be corrected under different conditions. Senanayake et al.163 summarized the scaling theory of contrast size-dependent diffusion of nanoparticles within164 entangled solutions versus cross-linked gels19-21. The theory gives a calculating model of165 the modification of particles in different particle size ranges19-21. For example, if the166 particle size is far smaller than the correlation length(\u03be), the particles experience mostly167 the solvent viscosity while for particles slightly larger than the mesh size (ax) the diffusion168 coefficient \ufffd ~ \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd[\u2212(2\ufffd/\ufffd\ufffd)2] . \ufffd is the particle radius, \ufffd\ufffd is the average distance169 between two permanent cross-links19-21.170\nIn all, lipid diffusion is hindered by biological gel structure which decreases the171 diffusion process. Thus diffusion constant needs to be corrected by considering the172 particle size of lipids, the degree of fixation of biological samples, and so on. For simple,173 we utilized the effective diffusion coefficient(\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd) to represent the real coefficient in Fick\u2019s174 law(equation[1]) though we did not know how the effective coefficient was precisely175 calculated.176 To explain the rapidness of solvent-based delipidation, we discussed the parameters177 in the above equations.178 A simple relation between delipidation time( \ufffd ) and sample thickness(\ufffd ), effective179 diffusion constant(\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd)can be written as below according to equation[1]:180\n\ufffd = \ufffd 2\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd [3]181\nFor the given biological sample clearing method, raising the temperature( \ufffd ) and182 thinner biological sample thickness(\ufffd) are strategies for accelerating delipidation speed183 and shortening clearing time according to the above equation[2]. For example, Yu et al.22184 and Murray et al. successfully sped the clearing time of PACT12 and SWITCH23 by185 elevating the temperature. SHIELD24 shortens clearing time by dissecting the whole186 mouse brain into hemispheres and it's obvious that brain slices are easier to be cleared187 compared with the whole brain.188 To compare the delipidation speed difference between organic solvents and189 detergent-based solution, we fixed parameters \ufffd (using brain slices with the same190 thickness ) and \ufffd (performing tests under the same temperature), so the difference in191 delipidation efficiency between organic solvents and detergents lies in parameter192 viscosity(\ufffd) and particle size(\ufffd) according to above equation[2][3].193 We first discussed the parameter viscosity(\ufffd), and considered that the viscosity lipid194 suffered during diffusion is affected by the resistance of the solution(solvents), the195 biological samples\u2019 gel mesh structure, and the volume of particles. Diffusion coefficient is196 reciprocal to the medium's viscosity(\ufffd). Among our tested organic solvents, THF and DCM197 were much more efficient than others(Figure 1), low viscosity may also improve their198 efficiency as no intermolecular hydrogen bonds are formed like alcohols. We also tested199 100% Triton X-100 for delipidation(Figure 1), as we expected, they are all not efficient, the200 less efficiency may be explained by its high viscosity. Apart from the viscosity of the201 delipidation solvents or solution, lipid transporting particles are also restrained by the202 biological gel mesh structure(delipidated biological samples can be regarded as203 electrolyte-gel16) in which lipids are subjected to greater viscous resistance during204 transportation within the biological samples to some extent, we regard this as an inner205 viscosity. The inner viscosity from biological gel mesh exhibits a decrease in the diffusion206 constant which may be corrected by the scaling theory. For example, the inner viscosity207 increases in biological samples delipidated by ionic detergent(SDS eg.) or organic208 solvents due to the shrinkage of biological samples. On the contrary, inner viscosity209 decreased in biological samples delipidated with some low-concentration of non-ionic210 detergents(like Triton X-100) due to the swelling of biological samples, this assumption211 may explain why Triton X-100 based protocol(CUBIC-L) are 3-7 days while SDS based212 clearing needs up to 7 days for whole mouse brain clearing according to previous213\nreports3,25. However, the clearing speed between SDS or Triton X-100 at low solutes214 concentration(around 10w/v) still needs experiments to be compared.215 Next, we focused on the parameter \ufffd (particle size), which represents the particle216 radius that transports lipids. Traditionally, hydrophilic methods(CLARITY, CUBIC eg.)217 utilized detergents like SDS or Triton X-100 for delipidation, in which lipids are transported218 in the way of micelles from the inside of biological samples(Figure 2B, 2C). However,219 large micelles of these detergents reduced the diffusion efficiency, especially for clearing220 large animal organs.221 To solve this problem, Zhao et al. introduced CHAPS in their SHANEL11 method in222 which CHAPS formed small micelles compared with SDS or Triton X-100 due to the223 special structure of CHAPS containing a hydrophilic tail and an atypical amphipathic head224 with a rigid steroidal hydrophobic convex side and a hydrophilic concave side bearing225 three hydrophilic hydroxyl groups(Figure 2D). Due to the high permeability of small226 micelles, SHANEL successfully achieved whole human or large animal organ clearing.227 A new lipids diffusion model of water-miscible organic solvents228 As for solvents-based methods, lipids transporting particles may differ from that of229 detergents, Richardson et al.26 summarized four ways of delipidation including both230 detergents and organic solvents, and they came up with the concept of the inverse231 micelle(Figure 2E) formed in hydrophobic liquid DCM which is a commonly used232 delipidation solvent in 3DISCO, uDISICO, SHANEL, etc26. Inverse micelles of233 phospholipids are automatically formed to hide their hydrophilic heads in the hydrophobic234 environment of DCM to maintain the lowest system energy due to the amphiphilic235 structure of phospholipids(Figure 2E).236 However, the inverse micelles model could not explain the delipidation process of the237 polar hydrophilic organic solvents (THF and low alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, etc.)238 as whose structure differs a lot from non-polar hydrophobic solvents. Here we assumed a239 new model of the delipidation process of water-miscible organic solvents, we240 hypothesized that no micelles or only very small lipid clusters are formed and the lipids are241 transported in the way of a single molecule or small clusters because water-miscible242 organic solvents are also amphiphilic in which phospholipids can be dissolved directly243 without forming micelles(Figure 2F, 2G).244 In short, we summarized five types of lipid transporting particles(Figure 2): (1)large245 micelles in SDS/Triton X-100 clearing, (2)large micelles in SDS/Triton X-100 clearing in246 hydrogel-embedded samples, (3)small micelles in CHAPS clearing, (4)inverse micelles in247 DCM clearing, (5)single or small lipid clusters in THF clearing. Our results demonstrated248 that both DCM and THF are more powerful than detergents(Figure 1A, 1B). It's easy to249 explain THF is more powerful than CHAPS as the former forms no micelle. However, both250 DCM and CHAPS solution forms micelles, so the new question is which micelles are251 smaller, micelles of CHAPS or inverse micelles of DCM? To answer this question, we252 need experiments to measure the real size of these micelles. Here we assumed that the253 inverse micelles of DCM are smaller than that of CHAPS as the size of the hydrophilic254 head of phospholipids is smaller than that of the tail, thus a small number of lipids are255 enough to hide their hydrophilic heads in DCM. If this assumption is correct, the sequence256\nof particle size is (1)=(2)>(3)>(4)>(5) under the premise that hydrogel does not change the257 micelle size.258 To systematically answer why organic solvents are much more efficient in lipid259 removal compared with detergents, we considered the influence of lipid-dissolution260 efficiency, the effective diffusion constant in Fick\u2019s law, and the lipid transporting efficiency261 of transporting particles, finally at least four possible reasons were summarized:262 (1) The dissolution efficiency of solvents is higher than that of detergents solution263 due to the higher collision probability between lipid molecules and solvents since264 solvent-based delipidation reagent contains 100% solvents while detergent-based265 reagent contains only 0-20% delipidation solutes.266 (2) The lipid transporting particle size(\ufffd) in organic solvents is much smaller than that267 of detergents which may dramatically affect the effective diffusion coefficient according to268 scaling theory, equation[2], and Stokes-Einstein equation.269 (3) Though solvents based clearing causes biological sample shrinkage which may270 increase inner viscosity(\ufffd ), shrinkage also reduces sample thickness(\ufffd ) which reduces271 the distance of diffusion.272 (4) The proportion of lipids in transporting particles in organic solvents is much higher273 than that of detergents since the particles in the detergent-based clearing are composed274 of both detergent and lipid molecules even lipids only take up a small proportion of the275 particle which reduce the transporting efficiency while the particles in organic solvents276 clearing consist of only lipids(Figure 2B-G). The above factors may jointly account for the277 rapidness of organic solvents.278 Based our new assumption and discovery, we have developed various much efficient279 delipidation strategies under the guidance of diffusion model, which further increase the280 reliability of the diffusion model(Figure 3, strategies 1-7, or s1-s7).281 Discussion282 Delipidation is a crucial step for high-quality clearing, however, delipidation process of283 organic solvents is rarely systematically studied. Our results indicated that organic284 solvents with certain structures exhibited better delipidation efficiency than detergent285 reagents even CHAPS could not surpass these organic solvents. In this article, we286 comprehensively discussed the delipidation process of both hydrophobic and hydrophilic287 reagents with a diffusion model. We proposed a new diffusion process of water-miscible288 organic solvents in which no micelles are formed during this process. We considered that289 the small size of lipids transporting particles contributed a lot to the rapid delipidation of290 organic solvents, other factors like viscosity(\ufffd), particle size(\ufffd), and sample thickness(\ufffd)291 jointly explained the rapid delipidation process of organic solvents.292 Among our tested solvents, THF and DCM are both sufficient for clearing 3mm293 thickness pig slice within 12h under room temperature, and THF seems just slightly better294 for brain white matter clearing, however, their delipidation ability comparison still needs to295 be further tested. On the one hand, THF may exhibit higher permeability than DCM as the296 former forms smaller lipid transporting particles size than the latter; on the other hand,297 hydrophobic DCM possessing higher logP(lipophilic index) is more lipophilic than THF.298 Thus THF and DCM exhibited similar delipidation ability of 3mm thick pig slices when299 considering both transporting particle size and lipophilicity. Here we hypothesized that300\nDCM is more powerful to clear relatively thin slices while THF may be more competent for301 clearing biological samples with larger volumes due to the high permeability. The above302 discussion is based on clearing the samples rich in amphipathic phospholipids(brains are303 typical examples). However, DCM may be more efficient for the clearing of biological304 samples rich in non-polar fat(triglyceride) like adipose biological samples as both fat and305 DCM are hydrophobic thus no micelles are formed. Indeed these hypothesis needs our306 further tests of experiments. Currently, our results of the clearing performance of307 hydrophilic organics like ethylene glycol or glycerol were very poor(Figure 1) which may308 indicate that lipophilic parameters(like log P eg.) of organic solvents are also very309 important for lipid removal other than the influence of the parameters in diffusion function310 as lipophilic solvents are more likely to dissolve lipids which is the prior step before the311 diffusion of lipids.312 In summary, we explained the rapidness of solvents based delipidation with the help313 of diffusion function which helps us establish rapid protocols for the clearing of biological314 samples of large volume or intact organs of large animals like pigs, dogs, or macaques315 due to the high permeability of some organic solvents. Various efficient delipidation316 strategies that we have developed may also indicate the reliability of the diffusion317 model(Figure 3). However, endogenous fluorescent signal quenching is a no neglected318 problem of most organic solvents, among all our tested solvents, TBA has a relatively319 better fluorescent signal retention ability27, thus rapid hydrophilic biological sample320 clearing method based on TBA is our direction for the next effort.321 Materials and Methods322 Reagents323 Chemicals CAS Vendor, No. PBS Solarbio, P1003 PFA 30525-89-4 Sigma, P6148-1KG Methanol 67-56-1 Sigma, 34860-1L-R Ethanol 64-17-5 Meryer, M83117-500ML 1-propanol 71-23-8 TCI, P0491 2-propanol 67-63-0 TCI, I0163 Tetrahydrofuran(THF) 109-99-9 aladdin, T103263-4L Dichloromethane(DCM) 75-09-2 Sinopharm Chemical Reagent\nCo.

After washing, samples were incubated in half337 diluted(50%v/v CUBIC-R(+) diluted with ddH2O) for 24h then transferred into CUBIC-R(+)338 for a further 2 days until biological samples became transparent. Transparent brain slices339 were put into the 6-well plate for image shots. Neglecting the distortion of tested samples,340 pig brain slices were directly immersed in 100% organic solvents without pre-incubation.341 The sample delipidated with DCM was washed 15 minutes*3 times by DMSO before342 delipidation with DCM in which DCM is water-immiscible and could not be used for343 delipidation without dehydration.344 Author contributions345 Jinglu Han proposed the core idea, and designed and performed the experiments.346 Xinyi Liu prepared part of the samples, and Jinglu Han, Xiaoxiao Hou, Zhengyi Yang, and347 Xinyi Liu, Zhiqiang Chen deeply discussed the design of the study and gave useful348 suggestions, Zhengyi Yang, Yuejia Zhong, Jinglu Han performed the diffusion349 mathematical modeling. Zhiqiang Chen gave import explanation of the rapidness of the350 delipidation of organic solvents. Jinglu Han drew the illustration, and Jinglu Han and351 Zhengyi Yang wrote the manuscript.
