    "abstractText": "Infections caused by Candida albicans (C. albicans) and increasing resistance to commonly used drugs lead to a variety of mucosal diseases and systemic infectious diseases. We previously confirmed that the essential oil of Clausena lansium (Lour.) Skeels seeds (CSEO) had antifungal activity against C. albicans, but the detailed mechanism between the chemical components and antifungal activity is unclear. In this study, a quantitative analysis of five volatile components of CSEO, including sabinene, \u03b1-phellandrene, \u03b2-phellandrene, 4-terpineol, and \u03b2-caryophyllene, was carried out using the gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) method. Both the broth dilution and kinetic growth methods proved that the antifungal activity of CSEO against fluconazoleresistant C. albicans was better than that of its main components (sabinene and 4-terpineol). To further investigate the inhibitory mechanism, the transcriptional responses of C. albicans to CSEO, sabinene, and 4-terpineol treatment were determined based on RNA-seq. The Venn diagram and clustering analysis pattern of differential expression genes showed the mechanism of CSEO and 4-terpineol\u2019s anti-C. albicans activity might be similar from the perspective of the genes. Functional enrichment analysis suggested that CSEO regulated adherence-, hyphae-, and biofilm-formation-related genes, which may be CSEO\u2019s active mechanism of inhibiting the growth of fluconazole-resistant C. albicans. Overall, we preliminarily revealed the molecular mechanism between the chemical components and the antifungal activity of CSEO against C. albicans. This study provides new insights to overcome the azole resistance of C. albicans and promote the development and application of C. lansium (Lour.)",

Invasive candidiasis caused by Candida albicans (C. albicans) is a major problem in the healthcare field that leads to high mortality rates (40\u201360%) [2]. The risk of disseminated candidiasis has increased due to the wide application of broad-spectrum antibiotics, glucocorticoids, and immunosuppressants, especially because of their increased use in AIDS and cancer patients. It was reported that C. albicans was the primary pathogen of invasive Candida infection (74.29%) in patients with perforated peptic ulcers who received laparotomies\nMolecules 2023, 28, 8052. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28248052 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 8052 2 of 14\nor laparoscopic surgery in Taiwan, China [3]. In addition, the mortality rate of sepsis (approximately 40%) caused by C. albicans is higher than that of any other sepsis caused by fungi or bacteria in the USA [4]. The azoles represented by fluconazole, with a broad antimicrobial spectrum, long half-life, high bioavailability, and few adverse reactions, have become the most common antifungal agents for treating C. albicans infection. However, drug resistance has significantly increased due to the general and long-term use of azoles in clinics [5]. Therefore, to address the issue of antifungal drug resistance, the potential mechanisms of antifungal drug resistance and two or more antifungal drugs used in combination have become hot topics [6\u20138]. Furthermore, another approach is searching for new active antifungal components from natural or traditional medicines to overcome antifungal drug resistance [9\u201311]. Essential oils (EOs) have attracted attention due to their unique physicochemical properties and biological activities. For example, the EO of Hyssopus officinalis L. from Bulgaria increased yeast membrane permeability and disrupted normal membrane transport by affecting membrane ATPase. It is active against both fluconazole-sensitive and fluconazole-resistant clinical Candida spp. [12]. The EO of Thymus vulgaris and its major active component, thymol, have strong antifungal activity against Candida spp. by inhibiting and eradicating biofilms [13]. Clausena lansium (Lour.) Skeels, belonging to the Rutaceae family, is indigenous to and commonly cultivated in tropical and subtropical regions of China such as Hainan, Fujian, and Guangxi [14]. In traditional Chinese medicine, the fruit of C. lansium (Lour.) Skeels has the effects of eliminating digestive stagnation, relieving gastrointestinal gas, dissipating heat, and relieving pain [15,16]. People usually eat C. lansium (Lour.) Skeels fruit fresh or make it into juice, preserves, or jam. However, C. lansium (Lour.) Skeels seeds, as a by-product of pulp processing, are mostly discarded. This not only leads to resource waste but also causes environmental pollution. Therefore, studies on the components and biological activities of C. lansium seeds are increasing [17\u201319]. There are many components, including alkaloids, volatile components, and coumarins, in C. lansium (Lour.) Skeels seeds. Their extensive biological activities have attracted widespread attention, including their anticancer, antidiabetic, anti-inflammatory, insecticidal, and antioxidant effects [20\u201322]. In our previous study, the comparative percentages of components of essential oil of Clausena lansium (Lour.) Skeels seeds (CSEO) were determined using the gas chromatography\u2013 mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method [21]. Each component was identified by comparing its relative retention index and the NIST library database. The relative contents of the components were computed using the peak areas without applying correction factors. The disc diffusion method showed the antifungal activity of CSEO against Candida spp. (C. albicans, C. krusei, C. tropicalis, C. parapsilosis, and C. glabrata) with inhibition zone diameters of 9.4\u201323.4 mm against both fluconazole-sensitive and fluconazole-resistant strains. Comprehensive analysis indicated that the chemical components might be positively related to anti-Candida activity, but this has not been verified. To investigate the relationship between the chemical components and anti-C. albicans activity of CSEO, quantitative analysis of five volatile components of CSEO, including sabinene, \u03b1-phellandrene, \u03b2-phellandrene, 4-terpineol, and \u03b2-caryophyllene, was performed using a standard curve method and GC\u2013MS. The transcriptional responses of C. albicans to CSEO, sabinene, and 4-terpineol treatment were determined based on RNA-seq to reveal the inhibitory mechanism of CSEO."

Finally, the contents of sabinene, \u03b1-phellandrene, \u03b2-phellandrene, 4-terpineol, and \u03b2caryophyllene were tested, obtaining values of 177.31 \u00b1 5.23 mg\u00b7mL\u22121, 2.69 \u00b1 0.18 mg\u00b7mL\u22121, 11.70\u00b1 0.45 mg\u00b7mL\u22121, 83.30\u00b1 2.36 mg\u00b7mL\u22121, and 1.51\u00b1 0.14 mg\u00b7mL\u22121, respectively. Among these five components, sabinene and 4-terpineol were the main components of CSEO. In our previous study, we found significant differences in the types and relative contents of volatile components derived from C. lansium using different extraction methods. A total of 33 volatile components were detected in C. lansium seeds from six different regions in Hainan, China, using the ionic-liquid-based headspace gas chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (HS\u2013GC\u2013MS) method [22]. The main volatile components were sabinene (17.76\u201343.81%), \u03b2-bisabolene (5.83\u201322.25%), and caryophyllene (6.75\u201316.62%). Forty-six volatile components were identified in thirteen EOs extracted via hydrodistillation using GC\u2013MS [21]. The volatile components were rich in sabinene (27.70\u201354.28%) and accompanied by \u03b2-phellandrene (13.39\u201325.91%) and 4-terpineol (6.33\u201311.83%). The components and contents greatly differed using different extraction methods. There were also differences\nMolecules 2023, 28, 8052 4 of 14\nin the components and contents using the same hydrodistillation method. For example, 26 volatile components were identified in the EO of C. lansium seeds from Changjiang County, Hainan, China [20]. The main components were phellandrene (54.8%), limonene (23.6%), and 4-terpineol (7.5%). The differences may be related to the origin, harvest time, drying method, and other factors. However, one of the most important reasons may be that all the above studies identified the volatile components in C. lansium by comparing the GC\u2013MS library database and the relative retention indices. These previous obtained contents of the components were calculated using the normalization method of the peak areas without applying correction factors. The contents were relative, not absolute, which led to the significant differences. In this study, a standard curve method using GC\u2013MS was developed for the quantitative analysis of five volatile components of CSEO, including sabinene, \u03b1-phellandrene, \u03b2-phellandrene, 4-terpineol, and \u03b2-caryophyllene. The method was simple, rapid, sensitive, and specific, with high accuracy. Finally, the contents of sabinene, \u03b1-phellandrene, \u03b2-phellandrene, 4-terpineol, and \u03b2-caryophyllene were tested. The content results of these five components differed from their relative contents, which is one of the reasons for establishing the quantitative method."

The MFCs were a little higher than the corresponding MICs. The MFCs of sabinene to C. albicans SC5314 and C. albicans 27 were 2.00 and 1.00 mg\u00b7mL\u22121, respectively. The MFCs of 4-terpineol to C. albicans SC5314 and C. albicans 27 were 4.00 and 2.00 mg\u00b7mL\u22121, respectively. The MFCs of CSEO to C. albicans SC5314 and C. albicans 27 were 2.00 and 0.50 mg\u00b7mL\u22121, respectively. Notably, the MICs and MFCs of sabinene, 4-terpineol, and CSEO against the fluconazole-resistant strain C. albicans 27 were all lower than those against C. albicans SC5314. The growth kinetics of C. albicans SC5314 and C. albicans 27 in the presence of sabinene, 4- terpineol, and CSEO (Figure 2) showed that these chemicals and CSEO have different degrees of influence on the growth trend of C. albicans at concentrations of 0.25\u20134.00 mg\u00b7mL\u22121. As shown in Figure 2, sabinene at a concentration of 2.00 mg\u00b7mL\u22121, 4-terpineol at 4.00 mg\u00b7mL\u22121, and CSEO at 2.00 mg\u00b7mL\u22121 inhibit the growth of C. albicans SC5314. Moreover, the growth of C. albicans 27 was inhibited with concentrations of 1.00 mg\u00b7mL\u22121 (sabinene), 2.00 mg\u00b7mL\u22121 (4-terpineol), and 0.50 mg\u00b7mL\u22121 (CSEO). The growth curves show that CSEO has a better inhibitory effect on fluconazole-resistant C. albicans than the two pure chemicals.

Yan et al. reported that two amides, lansiumamide B and lansiumamide C, isolated from C. lansium seeds displayed antifungal activity against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum [17]. The curative efficacy (75.17%) of lansiumamide B was better than that of the positive drug carbendazim (56.57%) against S. sclerotiorum infection, proving that it can cause cell rupture and abnormal hyphae in S. sclerotiorum. In our previous study, the antifungal activities of CSEO against five Candida strains (C. albicans, C. tropicalis, C. krusei, C. glabrata, and C. parapsilosis) were preliminarily investigated [21].

The transcriptome databases were obtained to investigate the antifungal mechanism of CSEO, sabinene, and 4-terpineol against C. albicans. We generated a total of 1,187,604,202 raw reads and 1,187,519,206 clean reads. The average error rate of all presented data was less than 0.03%. Table S1 provides an overview of the transcriptome assembly statistics. The gene expression levels under different experimental treatments were compared in terms of the FKPM values. The FKPM results show there was no difference in the expression level in each sample. C. albicans SC5314 c lls exposed to the MICs of sabinene (ca-s), 4-terpineol (ca-t), and CSEO (ca-so) f r 1 h were collected for the RNA-seq, r spectively.

A total of 268 identical DEGs among the three groups indicated that the anti-C. albicans activity of CSEO was related to sabinene and 4-terpineol. In addition, CSEO shared 240 identical DEGs with 4-terpineol and 82 identical DEGs with sabinene, which shows that 4-terpineol might play a more prominent\nMolecules 2023, 28, 8052 7 of 14\nrole than sabinene in the anti-C. albicans activity of CSEO. All 268 identical DEGs in the three experimental groups were selected to determine the differential gene expression pattern among the three groups via clustering analysis (Figure 3C). The regions of different colors represent different clustering information. If the gene expression patterns are similar, there are similar or identical biological processes in the same group. As seen in Figure 3C, three biological replicates in each group had similar gene expression patterns, but all three groups were significantly different from the control (ca-b). CSEO and 4-terpineol were grouped, exhibiting the highest correlation. These results show that the mechanism of the anti-C. albicans activity of CSEO and 4-terpineol might be similar from the perspective of genes."

            "text": "GO enrichment analysis was performed to investigate the DEG functions, including biological processes (BP), cellular components (CC), and molecular function (MF). The top 30 significantly enriched GO terms between the three experimental groups and the control group were selected and are displayed in Figure 4A\u2013C. The top 30 significantly enriched GO terms for C. albicans exposed to sabinene are shown in Figure 4A. There were 12, 9, and 9 subcategories in BP, MF, and CC, respectively. Figure 4B shows the significantly enriched GO terms for C. albicans exposed to 4-terpineol, including 11, 10, and 9 subcategories in BP, CC, and MF. The top 30 significantly enriched GO terms between CSEO and the control are shown in Figure 4C, including 13, 5, and 12 subcategories in BP, MF, and CC. The GO terms for C. albicans treated with sabinene have five, seven, and five identical subcategories with CSEO in BP, MF, and CC, respectively. The GO terms for C. albicans treated with 4- terpineol have seven, five, and eight identical subcategories with CSEO in BP, MF, and CC, respectively. This indicates that the anti-C. albicans activity of CSEO has close relationships with the two chemicals, and the relationship between CSEO and 4-terpineol is closer than with sabinene. We also found that there were 23 identical subcategories between sabinene and 4-terpineol, which indicates they had the closest relationship. This may be because they are both monoterpenes. In this study, our primary concern was the significantly enriched GO terms between the CSEO and the control. The significant changes in GO terms in biological processes mainly included multi-organism processes, interspecies interactions between organisms, and pathogenesis; cellular components mainly included the membrane part, intrinsic component of the membrane, cell periphery, and plasma membrane, and the molecular functions mainly included the activities of the transporters, oxidoreductase, and transmembrane transporter. Furthermore, KEGG enrichment analysis was performed to investigate the metabolic pathways, and scatter plots of all significantly enriched KEGG pathways are shown in Figure 4D\u2013F. The KEGG analysis for C. albicans treated with CSEO showed that all significantly enriched pathways of DEGs were mainly involved in metabolic pathways (82 genes), the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites (37 genes), and antibiotic biosynthesis (30 genes) (Figure 4F). There were fewer gene counts for the significantly enriched metabolic pathways of C. albicans treated with sabinene and 4-terpineol. To reveal the genes related to CSEO, the top 10 DEGs of the GO and KEGG enrichment analyses between the CSEO and the control were selected to draw a network diagram showing the involved genes. As shown in Figure 5A, the functions of DEGs associated with the expression of C. albicans genes mainly focused on biofilm formation, such as the membrane, the intrinsic components of the membrane, the cell periphery, and the plasma membrane. Biofilm formation in C. albicans involves complex processes, including cell adhesion, hyphae growth, maturation, extracellular matrix secretion, and cell dispersion. Biofilm formation is also related to the development of drug resistance [18,23\u201325]. The most involved DEGs of the GO enrichment analysis were AAP1, ACC1, ALS2, ALS3, ALS4, CSA1, CFL1, CFL2, CFL5, CRH11, ERG1, ECE1, FGR41, FET34, FET 99, GIT1, GIT2, HWP1, HYR1, IHD1, OPI3, OPT2, OPT4, PGA7, PGA11, PGA13, PGA15, PGA16, PGA17, PGA28, PGA32, PGA34, PGA37, PGA45, PGA54, RHD3, SAP10, SSU1, and YWP1.

For example, the agglutinin-like sequence (ALS) protein family is a type of cell wall glycoprotein, which is encoded by ALS genes, that regulates cell adhesion [26,27]. ALS3-encoded Als3p belongs to glycosyl phosphatidyl inositol (GPI) ankyrin, which is the most closely related to cell adhesion [23,28]. Loss of ALS3 can lead to serious biofilm defects. HWP1 is another important cell-adhesion-related gene [23,28,29]. The acidic mannoprotein HWP1P encoded by HWP1 also belongs to GPI ankyrin, which is necessary for mycelial development and the adhesion of C. albicans to host cells. In addition, the family of secreted aspartyl proteases (SAPs) of C. albicans plays an important role in the pathogenic process connected to adhesion, immune escape, and tissue damage [30].

Among these, the alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) gene family is soluble in hyphae and can induce Spider biofilm. ADH1 and ADH2 were detected during the transition of yeast into hyphae.

The MICs and MFCs of CSEO, sabinene, and 4-terpineol were in the ranges of 0.25\u20132.00 mg\u00b7mL\u22121 and 0.50\u20134.00 mg\u00b7mL\u22121, respectively. The effects of CSEO, sabinene, and 4-terpineol on the kinetic growth of C. albicans further proved that the antifungal activity of CSEO was better than that of sabinene and 4-terpineol against fluconazole-resistant C. albicans. Additionally, the Venn diagram and clustering analysis of the DEGs of C. albicans cells exposed to CSEO, sabinene, and 4-terpineol indicated that the anti-C. albicans mechanism of CSEO might be similar to that of 4-terpineol from the perspective of genes using RNA-seq. Via GO and KEGG enrichment analyses, the DEGs in C. albicans treated with CSEO were mainly concentrated in membrane-related cellular components and metabolic pathways, which may be one of the important reasons for CSEO inhibiting the growth of fluconazole-resistant C. albicans.
