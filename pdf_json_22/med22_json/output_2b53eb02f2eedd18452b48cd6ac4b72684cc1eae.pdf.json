    "abstractText": "RNA interference (RNAi) is a conserved mechanism of small RNA-mediated genome regulation commonly involved in suppression of transposable elements (TEs) through both posttranscriptional silencing, and transcriptional repression via heterochromatin assembly. The fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe has been extensively utilised as a model for studying RNAi pathways. However, this species is somewhat atypical in that TEs are not major targets of RNAi, and instead small RNAs correspond primarily to non-coding pericentromeric repeat sequences, reflecting a specialised role for the pathway in promoting heterochromatin assembly in these regions. In contrast, in the related fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces japonicus, sequenced small RNAs correspond primarily to TEs. This suggests there may be fundamental differences in the operation of RNAi pathways in these two related species. To investigate these differences, we probed RNAi function in S. japonicus. Unexpectedly, and in contrast to S. pombe, we found that RNAi is essential in this species. Moreover, viability of RNAi mutants can be rescued by mutations implicated in enhancing RNAi-independent heterochromatin propagation. These rescued strains retain heterochromatic marks on TE sequences, but exhibit derepression of TEs at the post-transcriptional level. Our findings indicate that S. japonicus retains the ancestral role of RNAi in facilitating suppression of TEs via both post-transcriptional silencing and heterochromatin assembly, with specifically the heterochromatin pathway being essential for viability, likely due to a function in genome maintenance. The specialised role of RNAi in heterochromatin assembly in S. pombe appears to be a derived state that emerged after the divergence of",

The\nfission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe has been extensively utilised as a model for\nstudying RNAi pathways. However, this species is somewhat atypical in that TEs are\nnot major targets of RNAi, and instead small RNAs correspond primarily to non-coding peri-\ncentromeric repeat sequences, reflecting a specialised role for the pathway in promoting\nheterochromatin assembly in these regions.

Genomic DNA\nmost widespread of these systems is RNA interference, which utilises small RNA molecules to direct either packaging of transposable element DNA into repressive heterochromatin, or degradation of RNA transcripts. Many fundamental discoveries about RNAi function have been made in the model fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe; however, this species is unusual as it does not generally employ RNAi to control its transposable elements. We found that in a lesser studied relative, Schizosaccharomyces japonicus, small RNAs are required to silence transposable elements, and that this silencing occurs via both formation of heterochromatin and degradation of transcripts. This dual function RNAi pathway targeting transposable elements that appear to cluster at centromeres is very similar to systems seen in complex multicellular organisms, thus our findings reveal S. japonicus to be an exciting emergent model in which to study RNAi and centromere function."

            "text": "RNA interference is believed to have evolved as an ancient defence mechanism against invasive genetic elements such as viruses and TEs [1]. While canonical RNAi pathways operate via small RNA-guided post-transcriptional silencing of target RNAs, in some cases small RNAs can also direct chromatin modification to enact transcriptional repression [2]. Unusually, in the fission yeast S. pombe, such chromatin-level regulation appears to be the dominant function of RNAi, with the majority of small RNAs corresponding to specialised pericentromeric repeat sequences that are assembled into heterochromatin in an RNAi-dependent manner. Non-coding pericentromeric transcripts are processed by the Dicer nuclease Dcr1 to generate short interfering (si)RNAs that guide the Argonaute effector protein Ago1 to complementary nascent RNAs [3\u20136]. This promotes recruitment of the histone methyltransferase Clr4 [7,8], resulting in methylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9me) and heterochromatin assembly at cognate chromatin [2,9,10]. Loss of pericentromeric heterochromatin impairs centromere function and hence strains lacking core RNAi components such as Dcr1 or Ago1, while viable, exhibit defects in chromosome segregation [11\u201313].\nWhile the S. pombe RNAi system has become a paradigm for small RNA-directed chromatin modification, it appears atypical of RNAi pathways in general as it retains limited capacity for canonical post-transcriptional silencing [14\u201316], and plays a largely redundant role in TE control [17\u201320]. S. pombe harbours only two closely related TE families, Tf1 and Tf2, belonging to the group of long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons that includes the Ty3 element of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the Gypsy element of Drosophila melanogaster [21]. Tf element-derived sequences make up around 1% of the sequenced S. pombe genome, and most of these are LTR remnants, with only 13 full-length copies of Tf2 and none of Tf1 [22]. These elements are dispersed throughout euchromatic regions of the genome, and are regulated by a specialised pathway involving CENP-B-like proteins that bind specific DNA sequences in LTRs and repress transcription [23\u201325]. TE transcripts are also subject to elimination by the exosome, and only in certain conditions, such as when exosome-mediated degradation is impaired, are TE transcripts strongly targeted by RNAi generating siRNAs that direct heterochromatin assembly at TE sequences [20].\nS. japonicus is another member of the fission yeast clade, estimated to have diverged from S. pombe around 220 million years ago [23]. Recent comparative analyses have revealed notable differences in genome organisation between the two species; in particular, S. japonicus appears to lack the specialised pericentromeric repeat sequences found in S. pombe, but has a larger\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010100 February 28, 2022 2 / 21\nsequencing datasets have been deposited in the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under accession number PRJNA770288.\nFunding: This work was supported by a Wellcome Trust Investigator Award (202771/Z/16/Z; http:// wellcome.org) and UK Medical Research Council Career Development Award (G1000505; http://mrc. ukri.org/) to EHB, and by the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research council (PhD studentships 1311387 to EC and 1101397 to FT; https://bbsrc.ukri.org).

The assemblies of these regions are incomplete, however eleven distinct families have been identified thus far, named Tj1 \u2013Tj11. These all belong to the Ty3/Gypsy family, but show much greater diversity than elements in S. pombe, falling into two major lineages, one (including Tj1, Tj4 and Tj6) related to Tf1/2 and the other (including Tj2, Tj3 Tj5, Tj7, Tj8 Tj9 Tj10 and Tj11) related to Ty3. Moreover, it appears there must also be key differences in mechanisms of retrotransposon regulation, since the CENP-B-like pathway that is active in S. pombe is absent in S. japonicus [23,27]. Interestingly however, retrotransposons in S. japonicus give rise to abundant siRNAs [23], and are enriched for heterochromatin-associated H3K9 methylation [23,26], suggesting that, in contrast to S. pombe, TE regulation may represent a major function of RNAi in S. japonicus. In order to investigate functional divergence in RNAi pathways within the fission yeast clade, we set out to dissect the role of RNAi in S. japonicus. Unexpectedly, we were generally unable to recover viable deletion mutants for RNAi factors, indicating that unlike in S. pombe, RNAi is essential for viability in S. japonicus. However, two viable dcr1+ deletion strains were recovered, and analysis of these revealed that viability was linked to compensatory mutations promoting maintenance of H3K9 methylation independently of RNAi. While high levels of H3K9 methylation were maintained over retrotransposon loci in these strains, retrotransposons were nevertheless deregulated at the post-transcriptional level. Our findings reveal that S. japonicus retains the ancestral role of RNAi in regulating retrotransposons, and that the pathway serves dual functions: heterochromatin assembly over retrotransposons that is essential for viability, and post-transcriptional silencing of these elements that is dispensable."

            "text": "To investigate RNAi function in S. japonicus we began by attempting to construct strains bearing deletions of genes encoding core RNAi factors including the sole Dicer and Argonaute proteins, Dcr1 and Ago1. We also attempted to delete genes encoding homologues of other factors critical for RNAi in S. pombe including Rdp1, Stc1, Chp1, Arb1 and Arb2. Unexpectedly, with the exception of rare dcr1+ mutant isolates (see below), we were unable to recover deletion mutants for any of these factors (Figs 1A and S1). We were also unable to recover strains deleted for the H3K9 methyltransferase Clr4. This was in contrast to deletion of genes known to not be required for the maintenance of heterochromatin (pku70+, pku80+ and tri1+) [28], which could be achieved with high efficiency (S1 Fig). Integration of epitope tags at RNAi gene loci could also be achieved with similar high efficiency (S1 Fig), indicating that failure to recover RNAi deletion mutants does not reflect an intrinsic problem in targeting these loci. Rather, these observations suggest that, unlike in S. pombe, a functional RNAi pathway is essential for viability in S. japonicus. To verify this conclusion, we tested whether an RNAi gene could be deleted following genomic insertion of a second copy of the gene at an ectopic locus. Whereas we were unable to delete the ago1+ gene in wild-type cells, deletions of endogenous ago1+ were readily recovered in the presence of an ectopic copy of the gene that maintained Ago1 function (Fig 1A). Similar results were obtained for dcr1+ and clr4+. These findings strongly suggest that, in contrast to S. pombe, a functional RNAi pathway is usually required for cell viability in S. japonicus.\nAfter extensive screening, we were able to recover two viable isolates bearing deletions of\nthe dcr1+ gene (hereafter denoted as dcr1\u0394\ufffd and dcr1\u0394\u2020 to indicate that these strains constitute rare survivors that may have acquired secondary mutations). The phenotypes of the two strains were indistinguishable, and for clarity we focus on results for the dcr1\u0394\ufffd strain (data for the dcr1\u0394\u2020 strain are shown in S10 Fig). Northern blot analysis indicated that retrotransposon-\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010100 February 28, 2022 3 / 21\nderived small RNA populations were lost or altered in the deletion strains, consistent with the loss of function of Dcr1 (Figs 1B and S2). This was further confirmed by small RNA-seq analysis, which revealed that populations of predominantly 23\u201324 nucleotide long siRNAs mapping to all ten families of Tj retrotransposon in wild-type cells were lost in the dcr1\u0394\ufffd mutant (Figs 1C and S3). For some families of Tj element such as Tj7, discrete populations of small RNAs were detectable in the dcr1\u0394\ufffd strain; however, these did not have the characteristic size distribution or 5\u2019U bias associated with bona fide siRNAs (Figs 1C and S3) [29,30]. Moreover, whereas siRNAs are typically derived from both strands, these Dcr1-independent small RNAs\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010100.g001\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010100 February 28, 2022 4 / 21\ncorresponded almost exclusively to the sense strand of the retrotransposons, suggesting they are generated via an alternative RNA processing pathway (Fig 1C and 1D).\nWe reasoned that the increase in abundance of these alternative, sense-derived small RNA\nspecies in the dcr1\u0394\ufffd mutant cells may reflect elevated retrotransposon mRNA levels. Consistent with this, RNA-seq analysis revealed increased accumulation of transcripts corresponding to centromere and telomere-clustered retrotransposons in dcr1\u0394\ufffd compared to wild-type cells (Fig 2A). Indeed, TEs were found to constitute the majority of upregulated loci in dcr1\u0394\ufffd cells (Fig 2B). Increased retrotransposon expression was also confirmed by RT-qPCR, with Tj7 showing the highest levels of transcript accumulation (Figs 2C and S4A). These observations indicate that, in contrast to S. pombe [18,19], Dcr1 plays a major role in regulating TE expression in S. japonicus.\nTo assess whether the increased retrotransposon expression is also associated with\nincreased transposition, we assessed element copy number by qPCR in dcr1\u0394\ufffd versus wildtype, parental cells. Nine out of ten retrotransposon families showed no increase in copy number in dcr1\u0394\ufffd cells, suggesting that despite increased mRNA levels, these elements are not competent for transposition. On the other hand, Tj7, which showed the highest levels of transcript accumulation in the absence of functional Dcr1, increased in copy number by approximately 10-fold (Figs 2D and S4B). Coupled with the observation that Tj7 was the source of the vast majority of Dcr1-independent small RNAs in dcr1\u0394\ufffd cells, (Fig 1B and 1C), this suggests that these alternative small RNA species may be associated with the retrotransposition process. Indeed, it is known that in the reverse transcription step of the mobilisation cycle, copying of single-stranded RNA into DNA is followed by RNase H-mediated cleavage of the RNA in the resulting DNA-RNA heteroduplex [31]. There is also evidence to suggest that RNase H cleavage sites are selected based on nucleotide preference within a defined sequence window [32\u2013 34]. Thus the observed Tj7-derived Dcr1-independent small RNA species are most likely RNase H cleavage products.\nThe RNA-seq analysis also revealed a number of genes up- and down-regulated in dcr1\u0394\ufffd\ncells (S1 Table). However, Gene Ontology analysis did not reveal any particular pathway enrichment amongst these genes, nor any other factors implicated in TE regulation. Interestingly, we also noted a number of previously unannotated genomic loci associated with increased transcript and decreased siRNA levels in the dcr1\u0394\ufffd cells, a signature otherwise characteristic of retrotransposon sequences. Indeed, analysis of these regions using the NCBI Conserved Domain Search tool [35] revealed that these loci largely comprised sequences encoding retrotransposon-specific protein domains (an example locus is shown in Fig 2E). Multiplesequence alignment of these regions allowed us to identify 10 new retrotransposon families, that we have named Tj12 to Tj21 (S2 Table). Phylogenetic analyses indicated that each of the new TEs falls into one of the two existing retrotransposon lineages in S. japonicus (S5 Fig). The majority of TEs in the S. japonicus genome are densely clustered in putative centromeric and telomeric regions, and the newly identified retrotransposons tend to reside in windows of previously unannotated sequence within these regions, consistent with S. japonicus centromeres being composed almost exclusively of retrotransposon-derived sequences.\nIn S. pombe, the RNAi pathway mediates silencing primarily at the chromatin level, being required for proper maintenance of H3K9 methylation on pericentromeric repeats. To investigate whether silencing of retrotransposons is mediated via a similar mechanism in S. japonicus, we analysed H3K9 methylation by ChIP-seq. Unexpectedly, we found high levels of H3K9 methylation at retrotransposons in both wild-type and dcr1\u0394\ufffd cells (Figs 3A and S6). This was confirmed by ChIP-qPCR analyses, which showed no significant change in H3K9me2 levels at any retrotransposons in dcr1\u0394\ufffd cells, suggesting that Dcr1 is not required to maintain H3K9me2 at TEs in these cells (Figs 3B and S7A). That H3K9 methylation levels are unaffected\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010100 February 28, 2022 5 / 21\nin dcr1\u0394\ufffd cells suggests that the observed increase in TE transcript accumulation is not due to loss of heterochromatin-mediated transcriptional silencing. As a complementary approach to verify this, we also assessed RNA polymerase II (PolII) association with retrotransposon loci by RNA PolII ChIP-qPCR, the expectation being that if increased transcript accumulation is\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010100.g002\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010100 February 28, 2022 6 / 21\ndue to transcriptional upregulation, this will be associated with increased RNA PolII occupancy. However, consistent with the H3K9me2 ChIP results, we observed no change in RNA PolII occupancy at retrotransposons in dcr1\u0394\ufffd cells (Figs 3C and S7B), indicating that increased transcript accumulation is not a result of increased transcription. Together these observations indicate that the elevated retrotransposons transcript levels observed in dcr1\u0394\ufffd cells must be largely the result of loss of RNAi-mediated post-transcriptional silencing.\nSince RNAi appears to be essential for viability in S. japonicus, and dcr1\u0394 strains were recovered only at very low frequency, we reasoned that some compensatory mutation(s) may be enabling viability in these rare dcr1\u0394 isolates. To search for such mutations, we undertook genome-resequencing of the two dcr1 deletion strains. Sequence analysis revealed only a small number of mutations affecting protein-coding sequences, and from these a single strong candidate mutation was identified in each of the mutant strains. One strain (dcr1\u0394\ufffd) carried a missense mutation (R77W) in the essential gene mpe1+, which encodes the ortholog of budding yeast Mpe1, an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is a component of the cleavage and polyadenylation factor (CPF) complex [36,37] (S8A Fig). This is interesting since recent studies have implicated other components of the CPF complex in RNAi-independent heterochromatin assembly in S. pombe [38\u201340]. Hence one possibility is that the R77W mutation creates a gain of function allele of mpe1+ that enhances H3K9 methylation in the absence of Dcr1. The other strain (dcr1\u0394\u2020) carried a frameshift mutation in the gene encoding Leo1, a component of the RNA\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010100.g003\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010100 February 28, 2022 7 / 21\npolymerase-associated factor (PAF) complex (S8B Fig). The frameshift is predicted to introduce a premature stop codon at position 61, resulting in a severely truncated protein (Fig 4A). This mutation was particularly striking since we and others have recently shown that Leo1 is a negative regulator of heterochromatin that antagonises H3K9 methylation in S. pombe [41,42]. Thus loss of Leo1 function might be expected to facilitate maintenance of H3K9 methylation in the absence of RNAi.\nTo confirm whether loss of Leo1 function is sufficient to rescue the lethality associated with\ndcr1+ deletion in S. japonicus, we generated a new leo1\u0394 strain, and then attempted to delete\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010100.g004\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010100 February 28, 2022 8 / 21\ndcr1+ in this background. Strikingly, isolates deleted for dcr1+ could be recovered with high efficiency in the leo1\u0394 background (79% positive, Fig 4B). This efficiency was almost as high as when a second copy of dcr1+ was present in the background (95% positive, Fig 1A). Thus absence of Leo1 can largely compensate for loss of Dcr1. To further investigate the mechanism of compensation, we next tested whether leo1+ deletion can also suppress lethality associated with deletion of two other factors: the RNAi component Ago1, or the H3K9 methyltransferase Clr4. Interestingly, ago1\u0394 mutants could also be recovered with high efficiency in the leo1\u0394 background, suggesting that deletion of Leo1 can compensate for the loss of not just Dcr1, but the RNAi pathway more generally (Figs 4B and S1). In contrast, we were unable to recover clr4+ deletion mutants in the leo1\u0394 background. This indicates that compensation is dependent on H3K9 methylation. These observations are consistent with a model whereby lethality in RNAi mutants is associated with loss of H3K9 methylation, and deletion of leo1+ restores viability by maintaining H3K9 methylation independently of RNAi. ChIP-qPCR analyses confirmed that H3K9me2 levels at retrotransposons remain high in leo1\u0394 dcr1\u0394 and leo1\u0394 ago1\u0394 double mutants, similar to wild-type cells (Figs 4E and S9A). In contrast, retrotransposons are still de-regulated in these mutants, as indicated by elevated transposon transcript levels and copy numbers relative to parental cells (Figs 4C, 4D, 4F, S9B and S9C). The double mutant strains also display growth defects relative to wild-type cells that are comparable to those in the original dcr1\u0394 survivors (S10A Fig), which may reflect the deleterious effects of increased retrotransposon mobilisation. These findings indicate that RNAi targets retroelements at two distinct levels in S. japonicus: chromatin regulation through H3K9 methylation, and posttranscriptional regulation independent of H3K9 methylation. The maintenance of H3K9 methylation appears to be essential for viability, whilst post-transcriptional regulation of retroelements does not."

            "text": "Suppression of TEs is an ancient and conserved role of small RNAs in eukaryotes. However, in the widely studied fission yeast model, S. pombe, the RNAi pathway has acquired a specialised role in heterochromatin assembly at specific repeat sequences and plays only a minor role in retrotransposon control in normal conditions [17\u201320]. Our observations now indicate that this specialisation occurred after the divergence from S. japonicus, the earliest branching member of the fission yeast clade, since an important function for RNAi in repressing active TEs is retained in S. japonicus. This repression occurs at both the transcriptional level, via deposition of repressive histone marks over retrotransposon sequences, and at the post transcriptional level, via Argonaute-mediated degradation of retrotransposon transcripts. This co-ordinated utilisation of transcriptional and post-transcriptional silencing in TE control is reminiscent of RNAi pathways in multicellular eukaryotes, and also has parallels with piRNA mediated repression of TEs in animals [43,44]. In these cases, whilst transcriptional silencing occurs in the nucleus, post-transcriptional transcript cleavage takes place in the cytoplasm, mediated by distinct Argonaute/PIWI family proteins [44]. As S. japonicus encodes only a single Argonaute, it will be interesting to investigate whether this protein forms distinct complexes for transcriptional and post-transcriptional repression, and whether these similarly function in discrete subcellular compartments.\nInterestingly, we note that different families of TEs display different responses to the loss of\nRNAi-mediated regulation in S. japonicus. For example, high levels of RNA accumulation were observed for both Tj7 and Tj10; however, only for Tj7 did this appear to be associated with increased transposition. The reason for this difference is currently unclear: we can find full-length copies of most of the identified TEs including Tj10, so there is no conspicuous\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010100 February 28, 2022 9 / 21\nreason why Tj10 would be non-functional, and conversely, there are no additional features in the sequence of Tj7 that might account for why this family alone is competent for transposition. A current limitation is that the precise genomic location of the majority of TEs in S. japonicus remains unknown due to the poor assembly of centromeric and telomeric regions; it is possible that resolving the position and chromatin context of these elements may shed light on the apparent differences in their function/regulation. Related to this, we do not know where in the genome new copies of Tj7 are integrated in the dcr1\u0394\ufffd cells; however, we note that Tj7 contains a chromodomain, a common feature of Ty3 type elements that has been shown to direct their integration into heterochromatic loci [45,46]. We therefore suspect that additional copies of Tj7 will have integrated into existing heterochromatic TE arrays. Also related, the relatively high levels of transcript accumulation for elements such as Tj7 in the dcr1\u0394\ufffd cells are perhaps somewhat surprising given that these elements are nevertheless associated with H3K9 methylation that is expected to repress transcription. However, it is possible that not all copies of these elements are equally enriched for H3K9me2, and some copies are efficiently repressed, while others are expressed (the high level of sequence identity precludes distinguishing between individual elements in the ChIP and expression data). Another, non-mutually exclusive, possibility is that this form of heterochromatin is permissive for transcription (as has been reported for H3K9me2-marked heterochromatin in S. pombe [47]). An unexpected finding is that H3K9 methylation is essential for viability in S. japonicus. In mammals, depletion of RNAi factors Dicer or Ago2 leads to embryonic lethality [48,49], whilst disruption of Suv39h1/h2 (the mammalian homologues of Clr4) severely reduces viability during embryogenesis [50]. However, S. pombe strains lacking RNAi or heterochromatin factors are viable. It is possible that uncontrolled TE activity may contribute to the lethality associated with loss of H3K9 methylation in S. japonicus; however, since TE dysregulation is also observed in viable leo1\u0394 dcr1\u0394 cells, we suspect that this may relate more to a critical role for H3K9 methylation in supporting centromere function. In S. pombe, H3K9 methylation is required for binding of the HP1 protein Swi6 at pericentromeres, which in turn recruits cohesin to mediate tight sister chromatid cohesion and support proper interactions between kinetochores and the mitotic spindle [51\u201353]. Loss of Swi6 or H3K9 methylation causes loss of centromeric cohesion resulting in elevated rates of chromosome loss associated with increased incidence of lagging chromosomes on late anaphase spindles [51,54,55]. However, presence of lagging chromosomes is also associated with slowed spindle elongation, suggesting that S. pombe cells possess a mechanism that can sense a lagging chromosome and create extra time for it to reach the pole [56]. The nature of this mechanism is not understood, but if it is absent in S. japonicus, this could account for the much more severe defects in mutants lacking pericentromeric H3K9 methylation. In addition, while centromeric cohesin is lost in S. pombe heterochromatin mutants, arm cohesin is unaffected, and it appears that residual arm cohesion can partially compensate for the loss of centromeric cohesion and maintain the fidelity of chromosome segregation at a level compatible with viability [51,57]. Therefore another possibility is that in S. japonicus, arm cohesion alone may be less effective in supporting accurate chromosome segregation, such that loss of centromeric heterochromatin has more catastrophic effects. Future comparative analyses of the factors underlying the differential sensitivity to loss of heterochromatin in these yeasts may shed further light on the evolution of mechanisms supporting centromere function.\nWhilst the centromeric regions in S. pombe comprise specialised repeat sequences, in S. japonicus centromeres are defined by arrays of retrotransposon sequence. This is reminiscent of arrangements seen in humans, where centromeres contain both retroviral elements and long-interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) [58], and plants, where specific centromeric retrotransposons (CRs) have been defined that are targeted by RNAi [59]. Likewise, Drosophila\nPLOS Genetics | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1010100 February 28, 2022 10 / 21\ncentromeres are TE-rich [60,61], and processing of retrotransposon transcripts into siRNAs is required to maintain pericentromeric heterochromatin [62]. Thus in the utilisation of RNAi as a primary mechanism to regulate TEs, the centromeric clustering of these mobile elements, and their use as a platform for assembly of critical heterochromatin, S. japonicus has much in common with plants and animals, establishing it as an attractive model in which to study both RNAi and centromere function."

For the deletion of ago1+, clr4+ and dcr1+, vectors were built by restriction endonuclease cloning, using pFA6a-natMX6 as a backbone (all plasmids used in this study are listed in S4 Table). For the ago1\u0394 and clr4\u0394 constructs, flanking homologies were generated by PCR amplification of a 1kb region upstream of the target gene start codon and a 1kb region downstream of the target gene stop codon, these were then subsequently restriction cloned into pFA6a-natMX6, either side of the natMX6 cassette. For the dcr1\u0394 constructs, the upstream flanking homology was generated in the same way as for ago1\u0394 and clr4\u0394, whilst two versions of the downstream flanking homology were constructed, both of which delete a portion of the dcr1+ open reading frame without interfering with any genes coded on the opposite strand. The first deletes the initial 108bp of the coding sequence and was named dcr1\u0394dis, whilst the second deletes a larger 2520bp portion and was termed dcr1\u0394del. These flanking homologies were also restriction cloned into pFA6a-natMX6, either side of the natMX6 cassette. The resulting four vectors: pFA6a-dcr1\u0394dis-natMX6, pFA6a-dcr1\u0394del-natMX6, pFA6a-ago1\u0394-natMX6 and pFA6a-clr4\u0394-natMX6 were used as templates for PCR. Deletion constructs for arb1+, arb2+, chp1+, rdp1+, rik1+, stc1+, tri1+, pku70+ and pku80+ were constructed using overlap fusion PCR of three fragments generated by PCR amplification of a 1kb region upstream of the target gene start codon, the HindIII ura4+ fragment from S. pombe, and a 1kb region downstream of the target gene stop codon. For deletion of leo1+ a vector was built using the NEBuilder HiFi kit, whereby a 1kb upstream homology arm, the HindIII ura4+ fragment from S. pombe and a 1kb downstream homology arm were cloned into a pFA6a backbone. The resulting vector pFA6a-leo1\u0394-ura4 was used as a template for PCR. In order to introduce ectopic gene copies at the nmt1+ locus, an S. japonicus version of the pREP1 vector was first constructed, whereby the S. pombe nmt1+ promoter and terminator were swapped for the corresponding S. japonicus versions [65]. The open reading frames of ago1+, clr4+ and dcr1+ were subsequently cloned between the nmt1+ promoter and terminator, and the resultant plasmids (pREP1SJ-ago1+, pREP1SJ-clr4+, pREP1SJ-dcr1+) were used as templates for PCR. For C-terminal tagging of chp1+, rik1+ and stc1+, 1kb fragments corresponding to the region immediately upstream of the target gene stop codon, and the region downstream of the target gene 3\u2019UTR, were PCR amplified and cloned into either pSO729 (eGFP) [66] or pFA6a-FLAG-natMX6 (5xFLAG) [67]. The resultant plasmids were linearised with NdeI for pFA6a-FLAG-NatMX6 or XhoI for pSO729 for use as linear transformation fragments.

For each newly discovered retrotransposon, the sequences of the reverse transcriptase, RNase and integrase domains were aligned to the corresponding domains from Tj1-10, as well as S. pombe Tf1 and Tf2 and S. cerevisiae Ty3 using ClustalW (Tj19 was excluded as we could find only partial elements in which these domains were not present). IQtree2 was then used to build a single tree based on the three domains, with 1000 ultrafast bootstraps. IQtree2 selected TVM+F+R3 as the best-fitting base substitution model using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Node labels indicate bootstrapping values. Scale bar is in units of base substitutions per site.
