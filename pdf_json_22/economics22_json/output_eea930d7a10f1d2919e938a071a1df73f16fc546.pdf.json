INTRODUCTION\nIn recent decades, more and more greenhouse gas emissions (e.g., carbon dioxide) have been emitted, and the increasing emissions have caused severe environmental changes. Because of the negative influences, the environmental issues have been receiving lasting attention from both academia and practice. In this situation, it is deemed important for manufacturers to decide if they should adopt environment-friendly production technologies (e.g., solar technology) that can lower the emissions but require increased production costs [1]. In the meanwhile, governments look for suitable regulation policies to reduce environmental damages by curbing emissions while improving social welfare. Among others, carbon emission tax has gained significant traction and is applied in many countries and local regions. In fact, economists regard a carbon tax as the most efficient way to reduce carbon emissions [2], and in some conditions, carbon emission tax is more effective than other regulations for economic growth and carbon reduction [3].\nUnder carbon emission tax, manufacturers are charged for each unit (i.e., metric ton) of their emissions at a fixed tax rate level. Because of the tax rate,\nmanufacturers have to pay for an additional carbon emission cost, which, in turn, drives their total costs to increase. Regarding this, carbon emission tax, in fact, intervenes manufacturers\u2019 micro-behaviors (e,g., pricing decisions) and ultimately affects manufacturers\u2019 profits [4]. As noted in literature, carbon emissions are generated mainly from production processes where products are materialized. Consequently, manufacturers\u2019 decisions (e.g., technology selection, production quantity) affect significantly carbon emissions to be generated in the future production activities. In this regard, carbon emission tax plays an influential role in manufacturers\u2019 decision-making, the result of which determines emission abatement. Caused by the inherent interactions, it is of paramount importance that manufacturers need to make decisions by taking into account carbon emission tax [5].\nIn a supply chain (SC), the decisions and activities, be they within or beyond the boundaries of an individual member, are interrelated and affect one another. For examples, a retailer\u2019s order quantity influences the manufacturer\u2019s production quantity, which may alter his wholesale price; the manufacturer\u2019s wholesale price decision is an indispensable input for the retailer to determine his retail price, which affects the demand. In an effort to obtain maximum profits, chain members should make joint decisions while considering the above unavoidable interactions [6]. However, due to the complexities involved, joint SC decision-making involving many interactions is likely to be very difficult. This is especially true in the environments where carbon emission tax is implemented (because manufacturers\u2019 decisions are affected by carbon emission tax).\nTowards the end, in this study, we address the joint decision-making of a manufacturer and his independent retailer under carbon emission tax. More specifically, we focus on technology selection, production quantities, and wholesale price of the manufacturer and the retail price of the retailer while considering a fixed tax rate per unit carbon emission specified by the local government. Our literature review has shown that though the published articles deal with joint decision making of a manufacturer and its retailer, they did not comprehensively consider all the above decisions together. (Note: Considering the limited number of pages, we will be happy to provide the detailed literature review upon request.) As shown in literature, the Stackelberg game theory excels in modeling decision interactions of two players. We, thus, analyze the\njoint decision-making of the manufacturer and the retailer as a Stackelberg game. The game model developed consists of two submodels: an upper-level submodel and a lower-level one. The upper-level submodel sheds light on the decision-making process of the manufacturer, whilst the lower-level one details the retailer\u2019s decision-making. By nature, the game model is a mixed 0-1, nonlinear, bilevel programming, for which it is impossible to obtain analytical solutions. Nested genetic algorithm (NGA) excels in dealing with bilevel programming models by providing near-optimal solutions [7]. Thus, we further develop a specific NGA to solve the Stackelberg game model. Numerical examples demonstrate (i) the applicability of the Stackelberg game model and (ii) the robustness of the NGA. With sensitivity analysis, we arrive at several important managerial implications.\nIn the following section, the problem context is introduced. The Stackelberg game model and the NGA are presented in Sections 3 and 4, respectively. We describe numerical examples and sensitivity analysis in Section 5. The paper is ended in Section 6."

            "heading": "II. PROBLEM CONTEXT",
            "text": "In the SC in consideration, there are a manufacturer and an independent retailer. (Such SCs widely exist in practice, e.g., an automobile firm and his independent retailers in different regions.) In his planning horizon containing T periods, the manufacturer produces one type of products and sells them to the retailer at a wholesale price w . We assume that the wholesale price\nof the manufacturer is stable in the planning horizon. In practice, stable prices are preferred in business with sales volumes over a relatively long planning horizon, while dynamic pricing is important in finite selling seasons for cases, such as airlines and hotels [8]. There are two technologies: a green one and a dirty one with capacities\nof g d B and B , respectively. The manufacturer can select\neither the dirty or the green one to produce products in each planning period. The green technology generates less emissions than the dirty one from producing one unit of products. However, it incurs higher production costs. To abate emissions, the local government motivates the manufacturer to adopt the green technology by offering a subsidy of b per unit product produced by the green technology. Authors have demonstrated that with the subsidy, the local governments can better motivate manufacturers to adopt green technologies in production [9]. In each production run, the manufacturer pays a fixed\nsetup cost ds or gs ( d gs s ) for adopting the dirty or\ngreen technology. In general, green technologies are more complex and consist of more components than traditional dirty ones. Setting up green technologies, thus, requires longer time and/or more engineers/technicians, resulting in higher setup costs. Besides the fixed costs, the manufacturer pays a variable production cost per unit cost\ndv or gv ( d gv v ) related to the use of the dirty/green\ntechnology. Assuming d gv v is rather intuitive. For\ninstance, the (non-fuel related) variable cost of operating a hybrid car is certainly higher than that of a regular car as the hybrid car has many parts and devices that the regular car does not have. When producing one unit of products,\nthe dirty and green technologies emit de or ge ( d ge e )\nemissions, respectively. For each of the inventory ik at the end of planning period i , the manufacturer needs to\npay a cost of h ; he also pays a cost of l for transporting\none unit to the retailer. According to carbon emission tax mechanism, the local government charges a tax rate of  for one-unit emission that the manufacturer emits from production. The manufacturer needs to select the dirty or\ngreen technology in planning period i , i.e.,  , 0, 1i ix y  .\nIn addition, he needs to determine production quantities\n/di giq q related to the dirty/green technology to meet the\nretailer\u2019s demand in period i . The manufacturer also\nneeds to determine w . The objective is to maximize his\ntotal profit Pr Mof in the planning horizon.\nThe retailer buys the products at w and sells them at a retail price of r . Similarly, in this study, we assume that the retail price is stable in the horizon. At the beginning of a planning period where the manufacturer adopts the green technology, the retailer carries out low-carbon\nadvertising program to stimulate demand io . The amount of advertising investment is a. The retailer needs to determine the retail price r in order to maximize his total\nprofit Pr Rof in the planning horizon."

Besides, the decision variable of Submodel R is involved in the objective function and Constraint (8) of Submodel M.

The NGA has three phases, including i) constraint removing, ii) modified model solving, and iii) constraint evaluation. In Phase i), Submodel M\u2019s constraints involving r are removed; a modified game model is developed. In Phase ii), the modified model is solved. The values of all decision variables are obtained. In this phase, the solving of Submodel R is nested in that of the modified Submodel M. In Phase iii), the constraints removed from Submodel M are evaluated using the decision variable values obtained in Phase ii). Based on the evaluation results, Phases ii) and iii) repeat till the final solution is obtained. See the algorithm details below.\nStep 1 Removes Constraint (8) containing r from Submodel M. Step 2 Generates randomly an initial population of a predetermined number of chromosomes corresponding to the solutions of Submodel M. Step 3 Evaluates the feasibility of chromosomes.

As shown, the\nmanufacturer selects both the green and dirty technologies in each of the two planning periods. Though the set-up cost of the green technology is higher than that of the dirty technology, the subsidy from the local government motivates the manufacturer to adopt the green technology in production. In addition, the lower emission released from producing a unit of air conditioner contributes to lower total emission costs, which, in turn, justifies the selection of the green technology. Interestingly, the production quantity from the dirty technology in each period is higher than that from the green technology in spite of i) the subsidy, ii) the lower emission released from producing one unit, and iii) the fixed set-up cost of the green technology that is irrelevant to production quantities. There are two potential reasons. First, the production capacity of the green technology is limited. Second, the unit variable production cost of the green technology is higher than that of the dirty technology. Thus, producing more air conditioners using the green technology results in higher total variable production costs. To conclude, making suitable decisions on technology selection and corresponding production quantities is very important. Our model is expected to help manufacturers make such decisions."

            "heading": "D. Performance Evaluation of NGA",
            "text": "To evaluate the robustness of the NGA, we test 10 times the base example. In each test, we generate randomly 20 chromosomes in the initial population and use the same input data. The results in terms of the manufacturer\u2019s and the retailer\u2019s profits are obtained. Among these 10 tests, in six tests including Test 1, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 10, the manufacturer\u2019s profits are identical. This is the same for the retailer. For the manufacturer, the average, largest, and smallest profits are 3.7519*107, 3.772*107, and 3.7321*107, respectively. The increase (decrease) percentage between the average and the largest (smallest) profits is 0.5% (0.5%). The retailer\u2019s average, largest and smallest profits are 1.7205*107, 1.7484*107, and 1.7013*107, respectively. Similarly, the increase (decrease) percentage between the average and the largest (smallest) profits is 1.6% (1.1%). These insignificant change percentages indicate that the NGA is robust.\nE. Sensitivity Analysis\nWe equally carry out sensitivity analysis to examine the impact of some parameters on the profits of the manufacturer and the retailer as well as on the decision variable value changes. These parameters include the emission released from producing one unit of product\nusing the dirty technology ( d e ), and the emission released from producing one unit of product using the green\ntechnology ( g e ), the government tax per unit emission\n( ), the subsidy offered by the local government (b), the\nadvertising investment (a). For each parameter, we obtain some interesting results. However, due to the page limitation, we present below the results and analysis\npertaining to d e . The results and analysis for other parameters are available upon request.\nEmission released from producing a unit of product\nusing the dirty technology ( d e ): In studying the impact of\nd e , we change its values from 600 to 700 in steps of 10 and obtain the results. (The results before 600 and after 700 remain stable. Thus, we present the results pertaining to the range of (600, 700).) As shown in Fig. 3(a), in general, there is a decreasing trend in the manufacturer\u2019s\nprofit changes. This is explainable. Increased d e potentially increases the total emission costs, which reduce the manufacturer\u2019s profit. By examining closely, we can see that the manufacturer\u2019s profit changes can be classified into several stages, including i) the increasing\nstage till d e is 630, ii) the decreasing stage till d e reaches\n660, iii) the increase stage till d e is 680, and iv) the decreasing stage. Such specific profit changes might be caused by production quantity changes, as shown in Fig.\n3(b). Responding to the increase of d e , the manufacturer has to reduce the production quantity from the dirty technology and, in the meanwhile, increase the production quantity from the green technology. Regarding the retailer\u2019s profit, it steadily increases along with the\nincrease of d e , as shown in Fig. 3(a). This is reasonable.\nAs mentioned above, the increase of d e increases the production quantity from the green technology and reduces the production quantity from the dirty technology. With the help of advertising, this, in turn, stimulates more demand, confirming Eq. (16). The demand increase contributes to the steady increase in the retailer\u2019s profit.\nThe above results and analysis reveal that i) certain\nranges of d e values, in fact, contribute to manufacturer\u2019s profit increase and ii) some ranges lead to manufacturer\u2019s profit decrease. Manufacturers, therefore, need to identify an \u201coptimal\u201d range, which can help them obtain higher profits. Our model is expected to facilitate the\nidentification of such an \u201coptimal\u201d range of d e . On shop floors, manufacturers should control well the production processes where dirty technologies are used so that the emissions released from producing a unit of product will fall in the \u201coptimal\u201d ranges. Because retailers\u2019 profits\nalways increase when d e increases, they might establish\ncertain contracts to encourage manufacturers to engage more/less the green/dirty technology in production."

            "text": "Given the inherent interactions between carbon emission tax and supply chain decisions and these among supply chain decisions and the resulting decision-making complexities, in this study, we investigated the joint decision-making of a manufacturer and his independent retailer under carbon emission tax. A Stackelberg game model including two submodels was developed to help i) the manufacturer optimally select technologies, determine production quantities and wholesale price and ii) the retailer optimally determine the retail price. We further developed an NGA to solve the game model for obtaining near-optimal solutions. Numerical examples demonstrated the applicability of the game model and the robustness of the algorithm.\nBased on the sensitivity analysis, we highlighted several important managerial implications. For example, manufacturers\u2019 profits do not decrease when the emission tax rate increases (Note: this is from the result analysis of  ). Therefore, local governments need to be very careful\nwhen determining the tax rate such that manufacturers can obtain higher profits without releasing increased emissions to the environments. Along this line, there are several avenues for potential future research. As initial efforts, we studied the joint decision-making of a manufacturer who produces one product and his independent retailer. Future research efforts might be made to develop models and solution algorithms for the situations where there are multiple substitute products and/or multiple competing retailers under carbon emission\ntax. It is interesting to see how the manufacturer and retailer make their optimal decisions in these situations. As carbon tax rates significantly affect emission abatement and social welfare, how a local government can determine an optimal tax rate together with manufacturers\u2019 and retailers\u2019 joint decision-making might deserve future investigation."
