    "abstractText": "Given its critical role in cell mitosis, the tubulin \u03b3 chain represents a viable chemotherapeutic target to solve the specificity issues associated with targeting \u03b1 and \u03b2 tubulin. Since \u03b3 tubulin is overexpressed in glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and some breast lesions, the glaziovianin A derivative gatastatin, presented as a \u03b3-tubulin-specific inhibitor, could yield a successful therapeutic strategy. The present work aims to identify the binding sites and modes of gatastatin and its derivatives through molecular-docking simulations. Computational binding free energy predictions were compared to experimental microscale thermophoresis assay results. The computational simulations did not reveal a strong preference toward \u03b3 tubulin, suggesting that further derivatization may be needed to increase its specificity.",

            "text": "Microtubules (MTs) represent major cytoskeletal filaments in all eukaryotic cells. They emanate from the centrosome, near the cell nucleus, and develop as a cytoplasmic network up to the cortical region. As interconnecting structures, they are involved in many cellular processes, such as motility, signal sensing, cell organization, structural strength, intracellular transport, and chromosome segregation during mitosis. Microtubule polymerization is regulated by a molecule called guanosine triphosphate (GTP). GTP is a purine nucleoside triphosphate exerting various functions in the cell, from being an energy source for protein synthesis and gluconeogenesis to acting as a signal transducer. Concerning microtubules, GTP is responsible for the mechanism known as dynamic instability, i.e., the alternation of assembly and disassembly cycles. The \u03b1-\u03b2 heterodimer hosts a GTP molecule at the dimerization interface in a nonexchangeable site. Upon the formation of the dimer, another GTP molecule binds to the exposed \u03b2 subunit in the exchangeable site located at the interdimer interface, as shown in Figure 1. This second GTP molecule, being more exposed to solvents, can be hydrolyzed to GDP during or shortly after polymerization; GTP hydrolysis is thought to provide MTs with the flexibility needed to undergo rapid turnover cycles of polymerization and\nCancers 2023, 15, 1714. https://doi.org/10.3390/cancers15061714 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/cancers\ndepolymerization. Indeed, hydrolysis leads to a change in the angle of the longitudinal assembly, which destabilizes lateral interactions between adjacent protofilaments. The formed microtubule structure can be stabilized by the presence of a GTP cap in the exposed \u03b2 tubulin monomers.\nAbove a critical \u03b1-\u03b2 tubulin concentration, heterodimers spontaneously assemble into microtubules in vitro, resulting in MTs having different diameters because varying numbers of adjacent protofilaments form them. Conversely, microtubule nucleation in vivo is initiated from a ring-like template of \u03b3 tubulin, which guides the polymerization of MTs, involving exactly 13 proto-filaments by polymerizing from as many \u03b3 tubulin units. The nucleation process likely occurs through the recruitment of \u03b1-\u03b2 dimers via \u03b1\u2013\u03b3 interactions, which are regulated by GTP similarly to the regulation of \u03b1-\u03b2 polymerization [2]."

            "text": "Among their various functions, perhaps the most critical role of microtubules is the formation of the mitotic spindle, as they comprise the most abundant components of the mitotic apparatus. These properties are at the core of why MTs are important targets for chemotherapy and why targeting them leads to significant side effects. Given their essential role in cell duplication, both microtubules and free tubulin have long been targeted by chemotherapeutic antimitotic agents, such as vinca alkaloids and taxanes, which act by disrupting normal MT dynamics, as any failure in microtubule assembly during spindle formation or the subsequent chromosome segregation phase typically leads to mitotic arrest and cell death. These compounds are effective anticancer agents, as they tend to impact dividing cells more than nondividing ones. However, as the structural components of microtubules, \u03b1 and \u03b2 tubulin are abundant proteins and make up approximately 2% of a cell\u2019s total protein content [3], so these agents affect both cancerous and normal cells by binding tubulin indiscriminately and often lead to severe side effects. These detrimental side effects may be reduced by increasing a drug\u2019s specificity for tubulin within cancerous cells only."

            "text": "Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is among the most aggressive forms of brain tumors. The prognosis for GBM patients remains extremely poor despite advances in therapies, as they have proven unable to prolong patient survival more than a few months. The World Health Organization classification of GBM is a necrosis-predisposed grade-IV cancer that is mitotically active, which means its cells proliferate at a higher rate than normal tissue cells. During mitosis prophase, a cell prepares to divide by condensing its chromosomes and starting the formation of the mitotic spindle, of which microtubules are the main component. In vivo nucleation of microtubules begins with a complex called \u03b3-TuRC (\u03b3 tubulin ring complex) formed by accessory proteins recalled by \u03b3 tubulin, which is, therefore, essential for the formation of microtubules. As \u03b3 tubulin is normally much less abundant than \u03b1 and \u03b2 tubulin, its overexpression in GBM and some breast lesions makes it an attractive target for pharmacological inhibition. Two main isoforms of human \u03b3 tubulin exist, namely \u03b3I, encoded by gene TUBG1, and \u03b3II, encoded by gene TUBG2. They share over 97% sequence identity, so any pharmacological agent targeting one isoform would likely target both [3]. Mouse studies by Yuba-Kubo et al. showed that mouse \u03b3-tubulin-expressing genes were orthologs of human TUBG1 and TUBG2, and it emerged from knockout experiments that \u03b3I, as opposed to \u03b3II, was essential to proper mitotic division [4]. In addition to this, studies by Katsetos et al. showed that both TUBG1 and TUBG2 were overexpressed in glioblastoma [5,6]; therefore, the analysis of the binding sites focused entirely on tubulin \u03b3I. Katsetos et al. [7] also found that tubulin \u03b2III was overexpressed and formed complexes with \u03b3 tubulin in glioblastomas and suggested that aberrant expression and interactions of tubulins \u03b3 and \u03b2III may be linked to malignant changes in glial cells. Moreover, a differential gene expression study by Wang and Zhang found the isotypes \u03b2IIa and IVa to be differentially expressed in glioblastoma compared to healthy brain tissue. They also analyzed the protein\u2013protein interactions of the differentially expressed genes products and identified a protein interaction network made of thirty proteins, among which tubulin \u03b2IIa and \u03b2IVa were predicted to be relatively important [8]."

[9] screened a library of \u03b2 tubulin colchicine site-binding compounds, namely colchicine itself, nocodazole, plinabulin, and glaziovianin A (AG1), in order to assess whether some of them were able to bind \u03b3 tubulin as well. AG1 was found to bind to both \u03b3 and \u03b2 tubulin with similar affinities, so it was derivatized to look for a selective \u03b3 tubulin binder. The findings reported in their paper showed that glaziovianin A (AG1) appeared to have similar binding affinities to \u03b1-\u03b2 and \u03b3 tubulin, while its derivative, gatastatin, whose structure is shown in Figure 2, reportedly had an almost 12-fold higher affinity for \u03b3 tubulin. Moreover, the authors suggested that gatastatin\u2019s mode of action was blocking GTP binding to \u03b3 tubulin, thus inhibiting its microtubule nucleation activity [9].\nA previous study by Friesen et al. [11] already investigated the binding of colchicine site binders to \u03b3 tubulin and, conversely to the results of Chinen et al. [9], they found that colchicine seemed to bind with equal affinity to \u03b1-\u03b2 and \u03b3 tubulin. Based on the high structural similarity (75%) between \u03b2 and \u03b3 tubulin, they also identified a homologous region on \u03b3 tubulin corresponding to the binding site of colchicine on \u03b2 tubulin. Shintani et al. [12] performed further derivatization of gatastatin that resulted in thirteen compounds, as shown in Figure 3. Among them, O6-modified derivatives reportedly showed higher cytotoxicity when acting on HeLa cells than gatastatin itself. O6-propargyl gatastatin (S9), in particular, showed the lowest IC50 value and also seemed to be a more potent inhibitor of the GTP\u2013\u03b3 tubulin bond in vitro. Therefore, the authors named this compound gatastatin G2 (G2).\nIn the present work, structural models of human \u03b1-\u03b2 and \u03b3 tubulin are used to perform molecular-docking simulations and MM/GBSA calculations that provide insights on the binding sites and modes of gatastatin and its derivatives and suggest that off-target interactions may still be a potential problem. MM/GBSA is utilized to post-process docking results, as it offers a more realistic portrayal of the ligand\u2013target binding problem when compared to docking [13]. This is mainly due to the fact that MM/GBSA takes into account the effects of solvation and entropy, which have a notable influence on the accuracy of the outcomes. Despite its computational efficiency, a trade-off between computational efficiency\nand accuracy is inevitable with MM/GBSA. Specifically, approximations for entropic contributions can make the method vulnerable to inaccuracies that are dependent on the system being studied [13,14]. In this study, these limitations are taken into consideration, and the resulting computational data are comparatively analyzed in a relative sense. A microscale thermophoresis assay comparing colchicine and gatastatin binding to \u03b1-\u03b2 tubulin is also performed. Furthermore, an analysis of the compounds\u2019 pharmacokinetic properties made with ADMET predictors highlights some potential delivery and toxicity problems."

Many such structures have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank over the last two decades; the ones that were taken into consideration are listed in Table 1. The structures were compared according to these three criteria, listed in order of their importance:\n\u2022 Resolution: any resolution between 1.5 and 2.5 \u00c5 was considered excellent. \u2022 Number of missing residues (MRES): a structure with fewer missing residues was\npreferred. Moreover, it was best if these missing residues were not in or near known or probable active sites.\n\u2022 Publication date: for compatibly with the other criteria, a more recent structure was preferable.\nPDB entry 5EYP, representative of free tubulin, was selected, mainly for its best resolution. The structure was prepared using Molecular Operating Environment (MOE) version 2020.09 [1] to correct residues with alternate locations, missing backbone atoms in the protein termini, missing residues inside the chain, and inconsistencies between the residue name and its structure. Ionization states and position-optimized hydrogens were assigned, and energy minimization was performed to relieve strains in the structure. The target sequences of human tubulin were downloaded as FASTA files from the UniProt KnowledgeBased (UniProtKB) database [16]; their UniProt reference IDs are reported in Table 2.\nHomology models were then obtained for each \u03b1Ia-\u03b2 isotype dimer in MOE using the co-complexed GTP and GDP molecules and the magnesium ions as an environment to prevent clashes and superpositions. The Protonate3D application in MOE was used to assign ionization states and position-optimized hydrogens. Upon refinement and energy minimization, the obtained models were inspected using ERRAT, Verify3D, WHATCHECK, PROCHECK, and QMEAN [17\u201321]. Particular attention was given to the overall quality scores and to the residues\u2019 distribution on a Ramachandran plot. As for \u03b3 tubulin, the PDB entries reported in Table 3 were inspected in terms of resolution, number of missing residues, and publication date.\nPDB entry 3CB2 was selected for its best characteristics in terms of resolution and number of missing residues. The original PDB entry contained two \u03b3 chains; the A chain was retained because it had fewer missing residues than the B chain. Only preparation and minimization of the structure in MOE were necessary because 3CB2 represented a human \u03b3 tubulin structure. PDB entry 6V5V was also taken into consideration to compare the folding of the selected template, since it was the structure of the protein in the native ring complex. Their structures were superposed and inspected visually, as well as in terms of the RMSD values in MOE."

Where applicable, the results from the three tools were then compared. Simulations Plus ADMET Predictor\u00ae 10.2 is a state-of-the-art ADMET property prediction software, so, given its reliability, it was regarded as a golden standard and used as a means of comparison for the other two tools.\n2.3. Binding Energy Predictions 2.3.1. Molecular Docking\nThe DockBox package [25] was used to perform consensus docking simulations for \u03b3 tubulin. The AMDock suite was used to identify the optimal center and size of the docking box for each ligand [26,27]. The box was centered on the co-complexed GDP molecule to define the GTP-binding site and on the residues identified by Friesen et al. [11] to obtain the putative colchicine site. Since the upper limit of the docking box sizes suggested by AMDock was 28\u00c5, a cubic box of size 30\u00c5 was adopted for every ligand. Docking results from MOE, AutoDock4, and AutoDock Vina were compared for consensus and rescored using DSX [28\u201331]. Docking in the colchicine site of \u03b1-\u03b2 was performed using MOE in order to maintain the co-complexed GTP molecule on the \u03b1 subunit and prevent clashes in the initial steps of the subsequent dynamics simulations. The binding site was identified based on the position of colchicine in the template structure from the PDB. Colchicine and GDP were redocked in their binding sites on \u03b1-\u03b2 and \u03b3 tubulin in the 5EYP and 3CB2 structures, respectively. The obtained poses were compared with the co-crystallized ligands in terms of RMSD.\n2.3.2. Molecular Dynamics\nMolecular dynamics simulations were carried out using the Amber20 package [32]. The simulations were performed for each target\u2013ligand pair as follows:\n1. Minimization with restraints; 2. Full-structure minimization; 3. Heating to 298 K in an NVT ensemble with a 2.0 picosecond coupling constant \u03c4; 4. Equilibration to 1.0 bar in an NPT ensemble with a Berendsen barostat [33], isotropic position scaling, and a coupling constant of 2.0 picoseconds; 5. Five 2 ns production runs with different initial conditions for a total of 10 ns.\nAs evaluated by Sun et al., when using various simulation protocols on the PDBbind dataset, excessively long simulations could negatively affect the outcome of the MM/GBSA calculations [14]. According to this study and the common practice of calculating binding energies using MM/GBSA, we opted to perform five 2 ns simulations for a total of 10 ns for each target\u2013ligand complex. A similar approach was successfully implemented in previous studies involving tubulin [34]. RMSD plots of the production runs for the representative \u03b1-\u03b2III dimer and \u03b3 tubulin are provided in Figures A3 and A4 in Appendix B. As the RMSD values in the second half of the simulations showed variations of the order of 1 \u00c5 or less, they were considered suitable to proceed with the binding energy calculations. The complexes were simulated in an octahedral box using an ff14SB forcefield with explicit TIP3P water. An ionic concentration of 0.15 M was simulated by adding appropriate amounts of chlorine and sodium ions. Periodic boundary conditions were imposed on the system during the calculation of nonbonded interactions. Particle Mesh Ewald was used for long-range interaction calculations with a 10 \u00c5 cutoff.\n2.3.3. MM/GBSA Binding Energy Estimation\nTo obtain a quantitative estimation of the interactions, MM/GBSA calculations were performed using the MMPBSA.py package in Amber20. The MM/GBSA method combines molecular mechanics (MMs) with continuum solvation models (generalized born, GB). The binding free energy is calculated as:\n\u2206Gbind = Gcomplex \u2212 [ Gprotein + Gligand ] , (1)\nwhere G indicates average free energy, calculated as follows:\nG = EMM + EGB + ESASA \u2212 TSsolute. (2)\nEMM is the mechanical energy in the gas phase; it is made of electrostatic, van der Waals, and internal energies (i.e., bond, angle, and dihedrals). EGB represents the polar contribution to the solvation free energy based on the generalized born implicit solvent model, while ESASA is the nonpolar solvation term based on the solvent-accessible surface area (SASA). Lastly, T is the absolute temperature, and Ssolute is the entropy of the solute. For each target\u2013ligand pair, the last nanosecond of the five simulations was considered for the binding energy calculation. The results were then averaged to obtain a final estimate."

The estimated binding energies for \u03b1-\u03b2 tubulin were averaged using the Boltzmann distribution and weighted by the relative quantities of \u03b2 isotypes in a healthy human brain [36] and in an untreated glioblastoma multiforme cell line [37].

Lastly, all homology models had around 91% of their amino acids in the most favored (core) regions according to the analysis with PROCHECK, and none showed residues in unfavorable regions.\n3.1.3. \u03b3 Tubulin Structure Inspection\nThe RMSD value between 3CB2 and 6V5V \u03b3 tubulin equaled 1.185\u00c5. This result indicated a good level of similarity between the structures. Figure 6 shows these results graphically: the structures are represented according to a color map in which a deeper shade of green indicates a lower RMSD value, while yellow, orange, and red tones mean progressively higher values. Since 6V5V had more missing residues, some portions of 3CB2 that did not match any 3D structure in 6V5V are depicted in white."

The results of this analysis summarized gastrointestinal absorption, BBB permeation, and P-glycoprotein interaction with the predicted values in the Boiled-EGG evaluation, as shown in Figure 7. Boiled-EGG is acronym for Brain Or IntestinaL EstimateD permeation. It is an egg-shaped classification plot in which the \u201cyolk\u201d represents the physicochemical space for highly probable BBB permeation and the \u201cwhite\u201d area shows passive gastrointestinal absorption. The egg is based on WLOGP for lipophilicity and TPSA for apparent polarity. Color-coding gives information about active efflux from the brain or the GI lumen, with blue for P-glycoprotein substrates and red for nonsubstrates.\nThe pharmacokinetic analysis indicated that neither gatastatin nor gatastatin G2 seem to be able to cross the blood\u2013brain barrier (BBB), which would make them unsuitable candidates for a possible therapeutic application for glioblastoma multiforme. In addition, another software package for pharmacokinetic prediction, namely ADMET Predictor\u00ae produced by Simulations Plus, predicted gatastatin G2 to be an hERG inhibitor, along with the derivatives of S5, S6, S10, S11, S14, and S15, which would render these compounds potentially cardiotoxic. Of all the analyzed compounds, the only one predicted to cross the BBB was S3, which also had a better toxicity profile than gatastatin G2."

            "text": "No indication of the specificity of the analyzed compounds for \u03b3 tubulin emerged from the comparison of gatastatin binding to \u03b3 and \u03b1-\u03b2, as shown in Figure 12. The estimates of the compounds\u2019 affinities for \u03b1-\u03b2 tubulin were consistently higher than for \u03b3. This is in contrast with the results by Chinen et al. [9], which predicted that gatastatin bound more strongly to \u03b3 tubulin. In particular, they reported a Kd value of 42.5 \u00b1 36.7 \u00b5M for the binding of gatastatin to \u03b1-\u03b2 tubulin and 3.6 \u00b1 1.3 \u00b5M for \u03b3 tubulin. It should be noted that the standard deviations of these results were 86% and 36%, respectively. Taking them into account, the lowest possible Kd value on \u03b1-\u03b2 tubulin would be 5.8 \u00b5M, and the highest for \u03b3 tubulin would be 4.9 \u00b5M. Therefore, the claimed preference for \u03b3 tubulin may be insignificant. In addition to this, it should be noted that \u03b1-\u03b2 tubulin expression is constitutive to all cells, making up approximately 2.5% of a cell\u2019s total protein content, while \u03b3 makes up less than 1% of the total tubulin content of a cell. Even when it is overexpressed, as it has been found for glioblastoma multiforme cancer cells, a substantially higher specificity for \u03b3 tubulin of the analyzed compounds would be needed in order to result in potent targeting in vivo. This is all the more true when considering that the proposed inhibitory mode of action of gatastatin is to prevent GTP binding to \u03b3 tubulin. The most likely way it\ncould succeed in doing so within tolerable doses is by having a higher binding affinity to \u03b3 tubulin than GTP itself. However, this hypothesis was not supported by the computational results. Moreover, with the structural similarity of GTP-binding sites in proteins other than tubulin, off-target interaction of such compounds could lead to undesirable side effects."

            "text": "There are numerous tubulin-targeting compounds that are effective anticancer agents, as they tend to impact dividing cells more potently than nondividing ones. However, targeting abundant \u03b1 and \u03b2 tubulin proteins almost always leads to severe side effects. These deleterious side effects may be reduced by increasing drugs\u2019 specificity for tubulin isoforms, which are expressed more abundantly in cancerous cells than in healthy ones. For some tumors, a possible way to discriminate between healthy and cancerous cells may be to target \u03b3 tubulin instead of the \u03b1-\u03b2 dimer since \u03b3 tubulin plays an essential role in mitosis forming nucleating rings for microtubules, particularly mitotic spindle microtubules. Thus, inhibiting its functions could have a powerful antimitotic effect. Importantly, \u03b3 tubulin has been found to be overexpressed in glioblastoma multiforme, some breast lesions, and carcinomas, while in healthy tissue cells, it is less abundant than \u03b1-\u03b2, making up less than 1% of the total tubulin content of a cell. Therefore, a compound having a strong specificity for \u03b3 tubulin could have fewer off-target interactions. The search for such compounds has been on-going for almost two decades. For the above reasons, it was exciting news when Chinen et al. identified a potential specific and selective \u03b3 tubulin inhibitor. The results of their drug-binding assays for colchicine, AG1, and gatastatin indicated that gatastatin bound to \u03b3 tubulin with a 12-fold higher affinity than to \u03b1-\u03b2 tubulin. Chinen et al. then suggested that gatastatin\u2019s mode of action was blocking GTP binding to \u03b3 tubulin, thus inhibiting its microtubule nucleation activity. This encouraging result has not been confirmed by an in silico analysis or verified experimentally by other groups. Therefore, we undertook not only finding a molecularlevel elucidation of the binding mode of gatastatin but also comparing its predicted binding affinity values for both \u03b1-\u03b2 and \u03b3 tubulin. Specifically, the present work was aimed at identifying the binding sites and binding modes of gatastatin, a potential \u03b3 tubulin inhibitor, and its recently developed derivatives. To date, other than the published results on gatastatin, there has been no success in finding a sufficiently specific and selective small molecule agent targeting \u03b3 tubulin preferentially over \u03b1-\u03b2 tubulin. This is due a high level of structural similarity between these important and highly expressed proteins. Based on a combination of in silico analysis involving gatastatin and its derivatives with respect to their binding affinities for human tubulin isotypes, we concluded that, unfortunately, none of these compounds appeared likely to have a preference for \u03b3 tubulin compared to the \u03b1-\u03b2 tubulin dimer. Our computational work was supported by thermophoresis assays. Consequently, we suggest further derivatization of the gatastatin scaffold guided by the computational binding predictions reported in this paper in order to search for a selective and specific \u03b3 tubulin inhibitor as a potential drug candidate for the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme. We believe that our paper opens the possibility for the rational design of a long-sought candidate drug with the desired specificity and selectivity for \u03b3 tubulin. This offers hope for finding a cure for brain cancer in the not-too-distant future.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, J.A.T. and M.A.; methodology, J.A.T., P.V., and M.M.; software, P.V. and M.A.; validation, Q.W. and M.M.; formal analysis, P.V. and J.A.T.; investigation, P.V. and Q.W.; resources, J.A.T. and M.M.; data curation, P.V.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, P.V. and M.A.; writing\u2014review and editing, J.A.T.; visualization, P.V.; supervision, J.A.T. and M.A.; project administration, J.A.T.; funding acquisition, J.A.T. and M.M.
