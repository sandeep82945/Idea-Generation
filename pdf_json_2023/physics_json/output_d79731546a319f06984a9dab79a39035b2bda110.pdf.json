Many efforts have been made to prepare mesoporous MOFs to improve the accessibility and the catalytic efficiency of MOFs by introducing template molecules, adjusting the length of ligands, and treating MOFs with special solvents.20\u201322 However, due to complex signal transduction in chiral recognition using bulk MOF powders, the application of mesoporous MOFs for enantiomer discrimination has rarely been reported, despite the signicant advantages of this approach.\nInspired by mimicked biological channels, articial ionic nanochannels have been applied in recent years in different elds, including energy conversion,23 biosensing,24 and others.25\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

In particular, an interfacial growth method to achieve asymmetrical MOF decoration by utilizing the catalytic activity of TiO2 is reported for the rst time. Gold nanoparticles (AuNPs), a kind of articial oxidase, are lled in Meso-L-CuMOF pockets through an in situ reduction approach. This nanochannel-based monosaccharide sensing device eliminates the requirement for natural enzymes and is economical and stable. More importantly, experimental results and numerical simulations indicate that a better-localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) mediated ionic product conversion is achieved owing to the nanoconnement effect of the Meso-L-CuMOF membrane, resulting in a stereoselective and substrate-selective robust sensing device. This study offers inspiration to design and prepare low-cost and stable asymmetrical nanochannels for monosaccharide enantiomer discrimination."

Benetting from the homochiral environment of MesoL-CuMOF, the constructed nanochannels show different affinities for glucose enantiomers. This distinct affinity enables one of the enantiomers to be transported through mesoporous MOFs and further oxidized by oxidase-mimicking AuNPs. The generated H2O2 is in situ monitored by the I\u2013V properties of nanochannels utilizing the Fenton-like activity of a CuMOF. TiO2M prepared by electrochemical anodization (details are presented in the Experimental section) is amorphous.27 A two-hour annealing (450 \u00b0C in\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nair) burns the remaining electrolyte and synchronously transforms amorphous TiO2M to anatase crystalline.28 Fig. 1A shows the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of the as-formed TiO2M, composed of \u223c48 mm thick parallel nanochannels (inset of Fig. 1A). Two entrances of nanochannels have different diameters, showing \u223c150 \u00b1 20 nm (denoted as the base entrance, Fig. 1A) at one side and \u223c40 \u00b1 10 nm at the other (denoted as the tip entrance, Fig. 1B). To achieve an asymmetrical decorated CuMOF for chiral sensing, CuNPs are rst coated onto the tip entrance by utilizing the photocatalytic activity of TiO2 nanochannels and interfacial growth strategy (details are presented in the Experimental section).29 Fig. 1C shows that a high-density layer of CuNPs is distributed on the tip entrance and nanochannel walls. These CuNPs are then transferred to homochiral MOFs exhibiting a mesoporous structure (Meso-L-CuMOF) by a typical template-assisted synthesis method (using BDC as an organic ligand, L-Phe as a chiral environment, and CTAB as a template).30 As shown in Fig. 1D and F, a layer of compact Meso-L-CuMOF nanocrystals appears on the tip entrance of TiO2Mwith a thickness of \u223c1.5 mm (further morphology details are presented in Fig. S1\u2020).\nThe sample's circular dichroism (CD) spectrum is recorded and compared with that of the model prepared without L-Phe (named Meso-CuMOF/TiO2M) to identify the homochiral character of the resulting MOF layer. Fig. 2A shows an adsorption peak at 210 nm on the Meso-L-CuMOF/TiO2M CD spectrum, indicating the homochirality feature. The liquid 1H NMR spectrum of Meso-LCuMOF/TiO2M also demonstrates the successful loading of L-Phe into the Meso-CuMOF (Fig. 2B). The mass percentage (9.6 wt%) of L-Phe in the membrane is determined by thermogravimetric analysis (TGA, Fig. S2\u2020). Compared with the sample containing the CTAB templates (named L-CuMOF/TiO2M), the content of mesopores in Meso-L-CuMOF/TiO2M increases as indicated by the enhanced intensity at a pore size of \u223c7.5 nm (Fig. 2C), conrming the presence of amesoporous structure inMOF layers. Meanwhile, the presence of mesopores is also demonstrated by Brunauer\u2013 Emmett\u2013Teller (BET) analysis (Fig. S3\u2020).

The accommodation space of mesopores provides a favorable feature for further functionalization. To further conrm the successful removal of CTAB, the Raman and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) analysis of L-CuMOF/TiO2M and Meso-L-CuMOF/TiO2M were performed.

The reduced N and C elements can be ascribed to the lost CTAB molecules. In this work, the well-known oxidase-mimicking AuNPs are integrated into Meso-L-CuMOF via a typical AuCl4\n\u2212 adsorptionNaBH4 reduction method (Scheme 1).33 As indicated by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images, the nanochannel wall is coated with aMOF layer (Fig. S6\u2020). As shown in Fig. 1F, the highangle annular dark-eld scanning TEM (HAADF-STEM) image shows that AuNPs are well dispersed on Meso-L-CuMOF/TiO2M, and the diameter of AuNPs is 5 \u00b1 2 nm (Fig. 1G). The highresolution TEM (HRTEM) images in Fig. 1H and I exhibit the characteristic lattice spacing for the (200) plane of AuNPs (JCPDS no. 4-784) and the (101) plane of anatase TiO2 (JCPDS no. 21-1272). The EDS mapping images reveal the well-dispersed Au, Cu, and N elements on channel walls (Fig. 1I). As the N resource only stems from the \u2013NH2 group in L-Phe, this result also veries the successful fabrication of Au@Meso-L-CuMOF in TiO2M. An increased absorption peak at \u223c400\u2013700 nm is observed in the UVvis absorption spectra (Fig. 2D), assigned to the optical absorption of scattered light by the LSPR effect of AuNPs,34 indicating an improved light-harvesting ability in the visible-light region. To further demonstrate successful formation of the AuNPs with an according LSPR, we peeled off AuNPs from the Au@Meso-LCuMOF/TiO2M sample by dissolving the Meso-L-CuMOF/TiO2M substrate in a HF solution.

In addition, the whole fabrication process is characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectra (Fig. S8\u2020) and X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns (Fig. S9\u2020). The absorption bands at \u223c3065, 1670, 1265, and 1050 cm\u22121 in the FTIR spectra coincide with those of bulk Meso-L-CuMOF powder. The adsorption band at 1265 cm\u22121 corresponds to the C\u2013N stretching of L-Phe. In the XRD patterns, the appearance of Meso-L-CuMOF peaks at 7.5\u00b0, and the disappearance of CuNP peaks at 42.5\u00b0 and 43.5\u00b0 also implies the transfer of CuNPs to Meso-L-CuMOF. The characteristic diffraction peak at 44.6\u00b0 is attributed to the Au (200) lattice place, conrming the successful introduction of Au.\nA target-discrimination-induced signal-on sensing strategy is designed by integrating the cascade reactions catalyzed by oxidasemimicking AuNPs and the subsequent Fenton-like CuMOF to achieve the recognition and quantication of glucose enantiomers in the as-proposedmembrane. As illustrated in Fig. 3A, the glucose enantiomers selectively recognized on homochiral MOFs are transported into themesopores and then oxidized to gluconic acid and H2O2 via oxidase-mimicking AuNPs.35,36 ABTS, one of the widely applied probes for evaluating $OH radicals, is employed as the signal reporter to provide a noticeable ionic current change. Owing to the Fenton-like performance of Cu(II),17 the CuMOF catalyzes the decomposition of H2O2 molecules into $OH radicals, further oxidizing ABTS to ABTS+. In addition, the Fenton-like activity of Cu(II) has been demonstrated to rely on the solution pH.17 The decrease in ambient pH caused by gluconic acid generated in the glucose oxidation reaction is thus favorable for activating the Fenton-like activity of the CuMOF. The generated ABTS+ cations change the ionic ux, as illustrated in Fig. 3B. The I\u2013 V properties of nanochannels thus offer sensitive signal transduction, indicating the corresponding details for enantiomer recognition and quantication. A traditional colorimetric assay studies the feasibility of the above hypothesis essay based on the characteristic blue color and the typical absorption peak of ABTS+\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nat 400\u2013900 nm (Fig. S10\u2020). By addingH2O2, the apparent blue color and characteristic absorption peak of ABTS+are observed in MesoL-CuMOF/TiO2M (Fig. S10A\u2020), verifying the Fenton-like performance of the CuMOF. In addition, when replacing H2O2 with Dglucose, the formation of ABTS+ is only found in Au@Meso-LCuMOF/TiO2M (Fig. S10B\u2020), verifying the oxidase-mimicking activity of the decorated Au NPs. Noticeably, the absorbance intensity of ABTS+ is discriminatory in the presence of glucose enantiomers (Fig. S11\u2020). D-Glucose inducesmore ABTS+ generation than L-glucose at the same concentration, suggesting a higher affinity between Au@Meso-L-CuMOF/TiO2M and D-glucose.\nEncouraged by the difference in oxidation ability of nanochannels towards glucose enantiomers and their ionic transport feature, the enantiomer recognition and glucose oxidation kinetics of Au@Meso-L-CuMOF/TiO2M are investigated by using the ionic transmembrane currents (I\u2013V curves). The as-prepared membrane is in the middle of the \u201cH-type\u201d cell, as illustrated in Fig. 3B. Two Ag/AgCl electrodes are inserted into two-half cells containing the same electrolyte (1.0 mM KCl containing 1.0 mM ABTS). The ionic transmembrane currents are recorded on TiO2M, Meso-L-CuMOF/ TiO2M, and Au@Meso-L-CuMOF/TiO2M (Fig. 3C). The current enhancement is observed in Au@Meso-L-CuMOF/TiO2M. The increased ionic ux indicates the formation of ABTS+ ions, and the ionic current results coincide with the results of the colorimetric assays (Fig. S10B\u2020).\nThe Fenton or Fenton-like process decomposesH2O2molecules and generates $OH radicals. In our design, as the yield of ABTS+ ions is directly decided by the ionic ux (sensing performance), a larger amount of $OH radicals is favorable. Recent reports show that the excited LSPR state of a plasmonic metal (mainly Au, Ag, and Pt) effectively facilitates the generation of hot electrons, subsequently transferred from the plasmonic metal to adsorbed reactants, thus elevating the enzyme-mimicking catalytic performance.37\u201339 The glucose oxidation in Au@Meso-L-CuMOF/ TiO2M nanochannels is investigated under visible-light irradiation (532 nm laser). When exposed to light, an apparent increase in ionic current appears (Fig. 3D, red line). The increased oxidasemimicking catalytic activity of Au@Meso-L-CuMOF/TiO2M under light irradiation is ascribed to the improved light-scattering ability of Au-LSPR (Fig. 3D and S12\u2020). The colorimetric assays are further investigated at 25 and 60 \u00b0C to exclude the thermal effect on catalytic activity under laser irradiation (Fig. S13\u2020). Although the ABTS+ products generated at 60 \u00b0C are slightly larger than that at 25 \u00b0C, higher ABTS+ yields are observed for both colorimetric assays when systems are exposed to a 532 nm laser. These results conrm that the enhanced ionic current mainly stems from the plasmon-enhanced oxidase-mimicking activity.\nConsidering the ionic current variation in the oxidasemimicking activity of AuNPs and the Fenton-like activity of CuMOFs, the LSPR-enhanced catalytic activity of Au@Meso-LCuMOF/TiO2M is explored from these two aspects. The reaction kinetics of glucose oxidation is further determined in the presence and absence of a 532 nm laser (Fig. S14A and B\u2020) to gain insight into the LSPR effect on the oxidase-mimicking activity of AuNPs. Fig. 4A and S14C\u2020 depict the corresponding Lineweaver\u2013Burk plots towards different concentrations of D-glucose and ABTS, respectively.

The plasmon-enhanced Fenton-like activity of Meso-LCuMOF is also investigated. The reaction kinetics for H2O2 decomposition by Fenton-like catalysis is also evaluated (Fig. S15\u2020). The steady-state kinetic parameters of the Fenton-like activity of Meso-L-CuMOF/TiO2M for H2O2 are shown in Fig. 4B, suggesting an effective reaction rate under irradiation. Upon LSPR excitation, the catalytic efficiency increases by 1.74 and 1.55 for ABTS and H2O2, respectively (Table S2\u2020), demonstrating the LSPRenhanced Fenton-like activity. These enhancements are attributed to the oscillating energetic hot spots (including \u201chot holes\u201d and \u201chot electrons\u201d) generated from LSPR-induced charge separation on a plasmonic metal surface. The hot holes are driven to the AuNP surface by the local electromagnetic elds and then participate in the glucose oxidation,38\u201340 thus leading to the enhanced production of H2O2, as shown in Fig. 4C.\nDue to energymatching, the energetic hot electrons are injected into the conduction band (CB) of CuMOFs, to convert Cu(II) nodes to Cu(I). The outstanding Fenton-like activity of Cu(I) also accelerates H2O2 cleavage into $OH radicals,41 thus achieving an improved ABTS yield. In addition, the Fenton-like activity at different temperatures is also carried out to show that the increased surface temperature does not induce enhanced activity under laser irradiation (the sample temperature exhibits a \u223c7 \u00b0C enhancement aer 30 min of 532 nm laser irradiation, Fig. S16\u2020). Comparing the colorimetric assays (Fig. S17\u2020) and I\u2013V properties (Fig. S18\u2020) at 25 \u00b0C and 60 \u00b0C, the heating inuence on Fenton-like performance of Meso-L-CuMOF/TiO2M is still limited, implying that the increased ABTS+ yield is mainly attributed to the formation of Cu(I).

As shown in Fig. S19A,\u2020 a slight current enhancement is observed when the temperature increased from 25 \u00b0C to 32 \u00b0C. When exposed to light (523 nm laser), a more apparent enhancement in ionic current is observed (Fig. S19A\u2020). As shown in Fig. S19B,\u2020 the ionic current enhancement is ignored as the temperature increased from 60 \u00b0C to 67 \u00b0C, which can be attributed to the stable GOD-like activity of AuNPs at higher temperature.42 In contrast, an apparent increase in ionic current appears when exposed to light (Fig. S19B\u2020). The above results demonstrate that the increased ionic transmembrane current is related to the hot injection and increased temperature at a lower temperature, and is mainly caused by hot injection at a higher temperature. These results indicate that the formed energetic charge carriers improve oxidasemimicking and Fenton-like activity upon LSPR excitation.\nBesides the dielectric constant of the plasmonic metal, the LSPR intensity of plasmonic nanoparticles is related to many factors, such as the particles' size, shape, and density, as well as the dielectric environment.43,44 To gain additional evidence of energetic hot spot generation by LSPR of AuNPs in the Meso-LCuMOF, the nite difference time domain (FDTD) method is employed to investigate the eld strength distribution in the Au@Meso-L-CuMOF structure, based on the TEM images in Fig. S6\u2020 (the permittivity of gold used in the simulation is obtained from Palik's data45). Besides the plasmonic enhancement in the nanogap between two Au nanoparticles, LSPR intensity shows an apparent increase at the interface between AuNPs and the Meso-L-CuMOF substrate (Fig. 4D). Moreover, according to a recent report by Beckham46 and Tiefenbacher,47 the nanoconnement effect of supramolecular hosts also facilitates the dual activation of both a nucleophilic (i.e., glucose oxidation) and an electrophilic (i.e., H2O2 cleavage) reaction in isolated binding pockets (i.e., the well-aligned mesoporous MOFs). These results indicate that the dielectric CuMOF substrate and the mesoporous frame structure favor the energetic charge carrier generation process.\nEncouraged by the remarkable catalytic activity of Au@Meso-LCuMOF/TiO2M for glucose oxidation and the homochiral character of nanochannels, the I\u2013V properties of the resulting membrane are applied to discriminate between glucose enantiomers. The transmembrane ionic conductances are investigated at different KCl concentrations to evaluate the ionic transport performance of Au@Meso-L-CuMOF/TiO2M (Fig. S20\u2020). The ionic conductance is mainly attributed to the bulk when the concentrations exceed 1.0 mM, as presented in Fig. 5A. When the concentrations are lower than 1.0 mM, the ionic conductance deviates from the bulk value, attributed to the electric double layer (EDL)-governed ionic transport in mesopores at low concentrations.48,49 To enable the ion current which mainly stems from ABTS+ ions, a low-concentrated KCl (1.0 mM) solution is chosen for L/D-glucose recognition and detection. For high detection sensitivity, the operating parameters, such as the concentration of ABTS, reaction temperature, and pH, are optimized through I\u2013V curves of Au@Meso-L-CuMOF/TiO2M under light irradiation.

The reaction temperature is studied from 25\u201380 \u00b0C, and the highest catalytic activity is obtained at 60 \u00b0 C (Fig. S22\u2020). The pH effect on cascade reactions is also evaluated based on the I\u2013V curves (Fig. S23\u2020). A burst ABTS production is found at pH 5.0. Accordingly, I\u2013V measurements in the following study are performed in KCl solution (1.0 mM, pH 5) containing 1.0 mM ABTS at 60 \u00b0C. However, considering high temperatures largely inuence the hydrogen bonds formed in the enantiomeric identication process,50 recognition is achieved at 4 \u00b0C for 4 h to gain a saturated adsorption state (Fig. S24\u2020). The nanochannels exhibit negligible catalytic activity at 4 \u00b0C, and recognition at 4 \u00b0C reaches a saturated state aer 4 h. Therefore, before triggering the glucose oxidation reaction at 60 \u00b0C, enantiomer recognition is performed at 4 \u00b0C for 4 h. The discrimination abilities of Au@Meso-L-CuMOF/TiO2M and Au@Meso-CuMOF/TiO2M for 10 mMof glucose enantiomers are evaluated through I\u2013V curves under optimal conditions. Fig. S25A\u2020 shows the I\u2013V curves of Au@MesoL-CuMOF/TiO2M aer cascade reactions catalyzed by enzymaticmimicking for 10 mM L-glucose and 10 mM D-glucose. Apparently, the ionic current elevation induced by 10 mM D-glucose is larger than that of 10 mM L-glucose. For comparison, the I\u2013V curves of Au@Meso-CuMOF/TiO2M were also recorded (Fig. S25B\u2020), which showed a similar ionic current elevation for the recognition of L/Dglucose. The above results demonstrate that the enantioselectivity stems from the chiral environment induced by L-CuMOF. To further conrm this conclusion, we also employed colorimetric assay to investigate the effect of Au NPs on selectivity. The oxidation ability of Au@Meso-CuMOF/TiO2M to L/D-glucose can be indicated by the color change of ABTS solution (the generated H2O2would oxidize ABTS to formblue colored ABTS\n+). As shown in Fig. S25C and D,\u2020 the results are consistent with the I\u2013V curves. The L-Phe molecules act as enantioselective identiers to interact with D-glucose than with L-glucose via hydrogen-bonding interactions.51 The discrimination abilities of Au@Meso-L-CuMOF/TiO2M for different concentration of glucose enantiomers are evaluated\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nthrough I\u2013V curves under optimal conditions (Fig. S26 and S27\u2020). Fig. 5B and C plot the I\u2013V curves of different concentrations of Dglucose and L-glucose at a 30 min-reaction period at 60 \u00b0C, respectively. The ionic currents gradually increase with glucose concentration from 0.1 to 10 mM. The ionic current elevation induced by D-glucose is larger than that of L-glucose from the ionic current change (DI) at different glucose concentrations (Fig. S28\u2020). The calibration curves show that the resulting Au@Meso-LCuMOF/TiO2M has an excellent linear response to D-glucose sensing over two ranges: from 0.1 mM to 1 mM and from 1.0 mM to 10 mM. The limit of detection (LOD) is 0.089 mM, based on a 3 SD/L method. Compared with other reported recognition methods (Table S3\u2020), this strategy exhibits a better LOD value, comparable with the recently reported colorimetric assay,52 CD spectra,53 and electrochemical methods.54\nApplication versatility and enantioselectivity are essential for evaluating a chiral recognition platform. The chiral sensing possibility of Au@Meso-L-CuMOF/TiO2M for monosaccharide enantiomers is estimated (Fig. S29\u2020). Fig. 5D plots the ionic current changes of the membrane for L/D-mannose, L/D-xylose, L/Dtagatose, L/D-ribose and L/D-galactose discrimination. The glucose enantiomers show a more signicant relative ionic current variation, attributed to the substrate selectivity of oxidase-mimicking AuNPs, also discovered in a previous report.55 Fig. 5E further presents the normalized ionic current changes. The chiral sensing device exhibits an excellent stereochemically controlled reaction process; D-monosaccharides show a more signicant affinity for chiral MOFs.\nConsidering the promising applications in biological samples, the main interfering species co-existing with D-glucose in human blood serum are investigated (Fig. S30\u2020). The ionic current changes induced by these interferences are ignored under the same experimental conditions as those of D-glucose sensing. Encouraged by the above results, the detection of D-glucose is further investigated in serum samples (Fig. 5F and S31\u2020).

A theoretical model (Fig. S32 and Table S5\u2020) based on FEM combined with Poisson and Nernst\u2013Planck (PNP) equations56,57 (details are provided in the ESI\u2020) is employed to simulate the glucose sensing process in Au@Meso-L-CuMOF.

Since the Au@Meso-L-CuMOF/TiO2M zone carries positive surface charges (Fig. S33\u2020), the strong electrostatic interactions attract more Cl\u2212 ions into the nanochannels, thus accumulating Cl\u2212 ions in Au@Meso-L-CuMOF/TiO2M. The concentration proles (Fig. 6C) and corresponding ionic ux images (Fig. 6D) of glucose and ABTS along the nanochannel are also simulated before the reaction. The electroneutral feature of both substrates and the electrical eld does not inuence their diffusion behaviors. The concentration proles and corresponding ionic ux images of H2O2 and ABTS\n+ along the nanochannel aer glucose oxidation are also simulated (Fig. 6E and F). Due to the low affinity between glucose and CuMOF pockets (high Km constant, compared to other Km), the generated H2O2 molecule oxidizes ABTS to ABTS+ using a CuMOF catalyst. Since ABTS+ ions carry a positive charge, they are depleted from mesoporous MOF pockets under solid electrostatic repulsion, increasing ABTS+ ion diffusion current. The ion/molecule concentration distribution on the Au@Meso-L-CuMOF/TiO2M surface is also investigated at \u22121.0 V (Fig. S34\u2020), showing similar results as the distribution at +1.0 V."
