    "abstractText": "In response to pathogen infection, some plants increase production of secondary metabolites, which not only enhance plant defense but also induce fungicide resistance, especially multidrug resistance (MDR) in the pathogen through preadaptation. To investigate the cause of MDR in Botrytis cinerea, grapes \u2018Victoria\u2019 (susceptible to B. cinerea) and \u2018Shine Muscat\u2019 (resistant to B. cinerea) were inoculated into seedling leaves with B. cinerea, followed by extraction of metabolites from the leaves on days 3, 6, and 9 after inoculation. The extract was analyzed using gas chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass (GC/QTOF) combined with solid-phase microextraction (SPME) for volatile and nonvolatile metabolomic components. Nonvolatile metabolites \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA), resveratrol, piceid, and some carbohydrates or amino acids, coupled with volatile metabolites \u03b2-ocimene, \u03b1-farnesene, caryophyllene, germacrene D, \u03b2-copaene, and alkanes, accumulated at a higher level in grape leaves infected with B. cinerea compared to in noninoculated leaves. Among the established metabolic pathways, seven had greater impacts, including aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, galactose metabolism, valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis. Furthermore, isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis; phenylpropanoid biosynthesis; monobactam biosynthesis; tropane, piperidine, and pyridine alkaloid biosynthesis; phenylalanine metabolism; and glucosinolate biosynthesis were related to antifungal activities. Based on liquid chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass (LC/QTOF) detection and bioassay, B. cinerea infection induced production of plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) including eugenol, flavanone, reserpine, resveratrol, and salicylic acid, which all have inhibitory activity against B. cinerea. These compounds also promoted overexpression of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter genes, which are involved in induction of MDR in B. cinerea.",

            "text": "Plant pathogens interact with their hosts in several ways in the infection course. One consequence of this interaction is that a pathogen will elicit production of plant secondary metabolites (PSMs), such as terpenoids, phenylpropanoids, fatty acids, and alkaloids. These compounds protect plants from biotic and abiotic stresses [1]. Plant secondary metabolites may be either preformed and constitutively produced in healthy plants or synthesized in response to pathogen infection [2]. Arabidopsis thaliana [3,4], Ephedra breana, Fabiana imbricata, Nolana sedifolia [5], Origanum syriacum var. bevanii L, Lavandula stoechas L. subsp. stoechas, Rosmarinus officinalis L. [6], Eugenia caryophyllata, and Cinnamomum zeylanicum [7] have been reported to produce high amounts of PSMs triggered by B. cinerea infection. Similarly, grapes (Vitis spp.) possess or produce bioactive compounds [8]. It has been frequently reported that B. cinerea infection is associated with type and intensity of photosynthesis [9,10]. Furthermore, C3 plants are less resistant than \u03b2carboxylating CAM plants. Low concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROSs) induced\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 654. https://doi.org/10.3390/metabo13050654 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/metabolites\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 654 2 of 17\nby biotic and abiotic stresses can act as signaling molecules to regulate development processes and defense responses in host plants [9,11]. These differences are related to production of PSMs [11]. PSMs are not only involved in signal regulation of pathogen\u2013 plant interaction but also may have direct antimicrobial activity against B. cinerea [3\u20138,11]. Unfortunately, PSMs have bidirectional effects on invading pathogens; some PSMs have antimicrobial activities, while some PSMs induce pathogen and insect resistance to antibiotics and pesticides [12\u201315]. Continuous exposure to PSMs may result in a pest becoming adapted to the phytochemicals (preadaptation) in response to drugs and other adverse conditions. Plant secondary metabolites can elicit insects to develop detoxification through preadaptation [12]. Detoxification enzyme systems of insects include but are not limited to P450 mono-oxygen transferases [12], carboxylesterases [13], glutathione transferases [16], ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter proteins [17], and uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucuronosyltransferases [18]. Botrytis cinerea is a widely distributed plant pathogen that attacks many economically important plants, such as grapes, resulting in significant losses in production [19]. Although B. cinerea has mechanisms to interfere with metabolic pathways of plants by detoxifying phytoalexins in grapevines [20], the documentation on whether PSMs can induce pathogen preadaptation is limited. We have recently confirmed that PSMs can induce preadaptationbased multidrug resistance (MDR) in B. cinerea (unpublished). The objectives of this study were to identify volatile and nonvolatile indicator compounds in grapes during infection and discover key PSMs that have antimicrobial effects against B. cinerea and induce MDR in the fungus."

The treatments included \u2018Victoria\u2019 without inoculation, inoculated with B05.10, and inoculated with 242 and \u2018Shine Muscat\u2019 without inoculation, inoculated with B05.10, and inoculated with 242. Disease severity and incidence were evaluated at the end of the trial, followed by collection of all plant samples into a Ziplock bag that was stored at \u221280 \u25e6C for later use. The sampled seedlings were processed for metabolomic analysis following the previously reported procedure [22]. Briefly, the sample was prechilled with liquid nitrogen and ground in a ball mill (MM400; Verder Shanghai Instruments and Equipment Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) at 30 Hz for 1 min. Each treatment had four replicates (plants). Each sample (200 \u00b1 2 mg) was dissolved in 1.8 mL of extraction solvent (methanol/water, v/v = 8/2) with 10 \u00b5g/mL of ribitol as an internal standard and was distributed into 4 tubes as 4 technical replicates. Each sample was treated with 100 Hz ultrasound for 20 min, followed by centrifugation at 13,800\u00d7 g for 15 min; 0.4 mL of supernatant was collected, desiccated at 45 \u25e6C in a vacuum concentrator, and stored at \u221220 \u25e6C until use. Methoxyaminen hydrochloride solution (20 mg/mL) in 100 \u00b5L was added to the sample, which was incubated at 30 \u25e6C for 2 h. The sample was added to 100 \u00b5L containing BSTFA (1% TMS) and incubated on a dry-bath block at 37 \u25e6C for 6 h for derivatization. After centrifugation, 120 \u00b5L of liquid supernatant was transferred into a sample vial sealed with a rubber cap, and metabolome analysis was performed within 48 h. Metabolites of grape leaves were separated and detected using an HP-5MS capillary column (30 m \u00d7 0.25 mm \u00d7 0.25 \u00b5m) coupled with the 7890A-5975C GC-MS system (Agilent, CA, USA). Helium was used as a carrier gas, with a 1.1 mL/min flow rate. Each injection volume was 1 \u00b5L. A GC oven was heated to 60 \u25e6C for 1 min, then raised to 325 \u25e6C at 10 \u25e6C/min for 2 min. The auxiliary heater was set at 290 \u25e6C. The ion source (EI) temperature was set to 250 \u25e6C. Electron impact ionization (70 eV) was set in a full scan mode (m/z 50 to 600) to 0.2 s/scan. To analyze metabolites using liquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry (LC-MS), the sample was prechilled with liquid nitrogen and ground in a ball mill (MM400; Verder Shanghai Instruments and Equipment Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) at 30 Hz for 1 min. For each treatment, six samples were collected as replicates; 500 mg of sample was dissolved in 3 mL of extraction solvent (methanol/acetonitrile, v/v = 3/1) and divided into 6 technical replicates (6 tubes). Each sample was vortexed at 2500 rpm for 2 min, followed by centrifugation at 13,800\u00d7 g for 15 min at 4 \u25e6C, and then filtered through a 0.22 \u00b5m filter membrane. LC-MS chromatographic analyses were performed on a Thermo Vanquish UHPLC system coupled with an ACQUITY UPLC HSS T3 (2.1 mm\u00d7 150 mm, 1.7 \u00b5m) column and Thermo QE HF-X ESIs. For positive ion analysis, the eluent was a mixture of methanol and H2O at a flow rate of 0.3 mL/min. The mobile phase consisted of 0.1% formic acid/H2O (solvent A), 0.1% formic acid/methanol (solvent B), 0.1 acetic acid/H2O (solvent C), and 0.1% acetic acid/methanol (solvent D). Gradient steps for positive ion analysis were applied as follows (using solvents A and B): 0 to 0.5 min, B: 2%; 0.5 to 6 min, B: 2% to 50%; 6 to 10 min, B: 50% to 98%; 10 to 14 min, B: 98%; 14 to 16 min, B: 98% to 2%; 16 to 21 min, B: 2%. For negative ion analysis, solvent C was used to replace A and D to replace B. The MS system was operated using both positive and negative ESIs in multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mode to identify the analytes of interest. The operational parameters for MS analysis were as follows: ESI source, sheath gas flow at 50 L/min and auxiliary gas at 13 L/min; spray voltage at 2.5 KV (+)/2.5 KV (\u2212); a capillary temperature maintained at 325 \u25e6C; an auxiliary gas temperature of 300 \u25e6C; secondary collision energy (NCE) at 30 V; an isolation window at 1.5 m/z; top N = 10; and a scan range from 70 to 1050 m/z.

Principal component analysis (PCA) analysis revealed two major differences within the metabolic profiles of 12 treated groups (Figure 4). In \u2018Victoria,\u2019 the metabolites were separated by sampling time, regardless of inoculation. In \u2018Shine Muscat,\u2019 the metabolites were not separated by inoculation, but 3 and 6 d postinoculation (dpi) samples were clustered in one group and 9 dpi was in another group.\n. l i i t noninoculate control."

            "text": "We found a trend that B. cinerea infection induced production of several PSMs to be upregulated from those in noninoculated grape leaves, although the increase was moderate. In inoculated leaves, many volatile PSMs were upregulated, such as \u03b2-ocimene, \u03b1-farnesene, caryophyllene, germacrene D, \u03b2-copaene, and alkanes. Nonvolatile PSMs showed a complex network of relationships. These included GABA, resveratrol, piceid, and some amino acids. Among them, eugenol, flavanone, reserpine, resveratrol, and salicylic acid were highly upregulated in two varieties of grapes inoculated with both isolates of B. cinerea. These compounds, with antifungal activities against B. cinerea, promoted overexpression of ABC transporter genes, which is associated with induction of MDR of B. cinerea. These findings are supported by previous results [31,32]. By comparing the metabolites and their pathways in grape leaves inoculated and noninoculated with B. cinerea, we found that they had significant differences in composition of volatile PSMs and predominant formation pathways. Some of these PSMs with antimicrobial activities, such as alkenes including heptane, octadecane, decane, nonadecane, dodecane, eicosane, tetradecane, \u03b2-ocimene, \u03b1-farnesene, caryophyllene, germacrene D, and \u03b2-copaene and the terpenoid compound \u03b2-pinene were more abundant [7,33\u201340]. Inoculated leaves also accumulated salicylic acid (SA) and jasmonic acid (JA). Both SA and JA are key signaling molecules involved in systemic acquired resistance (SAR) against biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens. This is supported by previous studies [9,41]. \u03b2-ocimene triggers plant defense responses via the signaling pathways of SA, JA, and ethylene (ET) [3,42]; increases concentrations of some glucosinolates involved in plant immunity [43]; and has antifungal activity [33]. (E, E)-\u03b1-farnesene is associated with disease inhibition demonstrated in fungal pathogens, suggesting its production is involved in fungal pathogenesis [34\u201336]. All of these results indicate that PSM upregulation mechanisms follow induction of B. cinerea infection. Botrytis cinerea infection induced or increased upregulation of nonvolatile compounds, including 3-pyridinol, butanoic acid, threitol, GABA, resveratrol, piceid, flavanone, catechin, eugenol, and some amino acids, regardless of grape variety. \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) plays as a signal molecule, eliciting plant defense against abiotic stresses [44], as it is involved in the expressions of genes for plant signal transduction, transcrip-\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 654 14 of 17\ntional control, hormone biosynthesis, reactive oxygen species generation, and polyamine metabolism [31,43,44]. Therefore, GABA is an important metabolite, contributing to disease resistance. The Lys catabolite pipecolic acid (Pip) is a critical metabolic mediator of several forms of inducible resistance in Arabidopsis, which accumulates following pathogen recognition [45]. Then, N-hydroxypipecolic acid (NHP) is the actual regulator of SAR rather than Pip [46,47]. This result was consistent with the downregulated Pip in the leaves of the treated group compared to the non-treated group, probably attributable to hydroxylation of Pip to NHP. Unfortunately, the compound directly involved in SAR was not detected. Plants have developed several systems to regulate levels of ROSs. Abiotic stresses cause accumulation of ROSs and reduce photosynthetic activity, which triggers production of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and compounds such as proline, glutathione, ascorbic acid, carotenoids, flavonoids, and tocopherols to alleviate oxidative damage by neutralizing ROSs [11]. Among the PSMs detected in this study, ascorbic acid was upregulated after B. cinerea infection regardless of grape variety. This indicates that ascorbic acid may act as a deoxidizer. Plant secondary metabolites (PSMs) possessing antifungal activities can be a potential resource for fungicide development. For example, since resveratrol and its derivative are linked to plant immunity [32,48,49], they have been registered as an effective fungicide in China (http://www.chinapesticide.org.cn/, accessed on 31 December 2021) for controlling cucumber gray mold. In this study, resveratrol, reaveratroloside, and trans-piceid showed significant upregulation in B. cinerea-inoculated grape leaves. Resveratrol resulted in up to 47% inhibition of B. cinerea. This moderate efficacy can be increased by changing the chemical structure, which was demonstrated by in vivo methylation of hydroxyphenyl groups in phenolics [50]. Differential metabolites were more numerous in the resistant variety \u2018Shine Muscat\u2019 than in the susceptible variety \u2018Victoria\u2019. \u2018Shine Muscat\u2019 had more compounds with higher levels of antifungal activity regardless of B. cinerea inoculation. These compounds might suppress infection and proliferation of pathogens [51]. Interestingly, some metabolites were regulated differently when the grape was infected with wild-type B. cinerea or with an MDRcontaining strain. While B. cinerea 242 can develop MDR, it may have a cost of fitness and reduced virulence toward the host plant, which was confirmed not only in this study but also in several other studies on B. cinerea. Therefore, acquisition of high-level resistance is associated with a decrease in fitness [52]. Meanwhile, grape plants with different resistance have different metabolomic activities, as shown in the susceptible variety \u2018Victoria\u2019 versus the resistant variety \u2018Shine Muscat.\u2019 This indicates that plant defense against pathogen infection through metabolomic regulation is dependent on its resistance level. On one hand, PSMs, such as phytoalexins, can be induced by pathogens and increase plant defense against the pathogens [53,54]. On the other hand, the pathogens may be adaptive to and detoxify PSMs by enhancing the ABC efflux system [55\u201358]. In fungi, ABC transporters are involved in transportation of PSMs such as phenylpropanoids, lignans, flavonoids, and condensed tannins [59,60] and are also upregulated when exposed to some PSMs, such as eugenol and reserpine [61]. These studies support our results. We found that eugenol, flavanone, reserpine, resveratrol, and salicylic acid inhibited B. cinerea but promoted, in the fungus, overexpression of three major ABC transporter genes: BcatrB, BcatrD, and BcatrK. As such, we speculate that when exposed to antimicrobial PSMs, the pathogen would carry out the efflux of PSMs, impeding their antimicrobial activity. All tested PSMs exerted growth inhibition but could potentially elicit preadaptation in B. cinerea."

            "text": "In this study, we found that B. cinerea infection triggered grapes to increase production of some secondary metabolites that have antifungal bioactivities and therefore enhanced plant resistance to diseases such as B. cinerea. We identified indicator compounds in grapes during infection and discovered key secondary metabolites that are associated with the defensive activities of grapes in inhibiting B. cinerea. The downside of these PSMs is that the\nMetabolites 2023, 13, 654 15 of 17\npathogen may be adaptive to and detoxify PSMs by enhancing the ABC efflux system, which impedes the antimicrobial activity of PSMs. These findings enhanced our understanding of plant resistance in host plants and provided a new perspective for development of MDR of B. cinerea. PSM adaptation with the pathogen should be considered when a fungicide is to be developed using PSMs and their derivatives.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/metabo13050654/s1, Table S1: Analysis of Gas chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass on differential non-volatile metabolites of grape \u2018Victoria\u2019 that was either non-inoculated (NI), inoculated with Botrytis cinerea B05.10 (B5), or inoculated with B. cinerea 242 (B2); Table S2: Analysis of Gas chromatography/quadrupole time-of-flight mass on differential non-volatile metabolites leaves of grape \u2018Shine Muscat\u2019 that was either non-inoculated (NI), inoculated with Botrytis cinerea B05.10 (B5) or inoculated with B. cinerea 242 (B2); Table S3: Differential metabolites compared grapes varieties \u2018Shine Muscat\u2019 and \u2018Victoria\u2019 that were either inoculated with Botrytis cinerea B05.10, inoculated with B. cinerea 242, or non-inoculated; Table S4: Differential volatile metabolites of grape \u2018Shine Muscat\u2019 leaves by comparing the group inoculated with Botrytis cinerea and the group without inoculation.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, P.L.; methodology, Z.W., P.L.; investigation, Z.W. and T.G.; data curation, Z.W., T.G. and Z.L.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, Z.W.; writing\u2014review and editing, P.L., J.H. and X.L.; funding acquisition, P.L.
