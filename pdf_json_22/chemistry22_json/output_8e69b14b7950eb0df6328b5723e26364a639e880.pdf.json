Recently, we reported alginate lyase VxAly7B containing a CBM32 and a polysaccharide lyase family 7 (PL7). To investigate the specific function of CBM32, we characterized the full-length alginate lyase VxAly7B (VxAly7B-FL) and truncated mutants VxAly7B-CM (PL7) and VxAly7B-CBM (CBM32). Both VxAly7BFL and native VxAly7B can spontaneously cleavage between CBM32 and PL7. The substrate-binding capacity and activity of VxAly7B-CM to soluble alginate were 0.86and 1.97-fold those of VxAly7B-FL, respectively. Moreover, CBM32 could accelerate the expansion and cleavage of alginate gel beads, and the degradation rate of VxAly7B-FL to alginate gel beads was threefold that of VxAly7B-CM. Results showed that CBM32 is not conducive to the degradation of soluble alginate by VxAly7B but is helpful for binding and degradation of insoluble alginate gel. This study provides new insights into the function of CBM32 on alginate gel, which may inspire the application strategy of CBMs in insoluble substrates.",

This study provides new insights into the function of CBM32 on alginate gel, which may inspire the application strategy of CBMs in insoluble substrates.\nKeywords: alginate lyase, alginate gel, insoluble substrate, carbohydrate-binding module (CBM), binding capacity, function\nINTRODUCTION\nBrown algae, important marine primary producers (Enr\u00edquez and Borowitzka, 2010), constitute a large amount of biomass in marine ecosystems (Duarte et al., 2004; Roesijadi et al., 2010; Wargacki et al., 2012). Alginate is the most abundant polysaccharide in brown algae, accounting for approximately 40% of its dry weight (Chung et al., 2011; Popper et al., 2011). Alginate is an acidic linear polysaccharide composed of \u03b1-L-guluronate (G) and its C5 epimer \u03b2-D-mannuronate (M), arranged in three kinds of blocks: homopolymeric M blocks (polyM), homopolymeric G blocks (polyG), and heteropolymeric blocks composed of alternating M and G (polyMG) (Gacesa, 1988). Due to its high safety, unique physical and chemical properties, and biological functions, alginate has a wide range of applications in the fields of food, agriculture, and medicine (Stevens et al., 2004;\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 1 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 798819\nAarstad et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2019). Studies have found that alginate can spontaneously form a gel in the presence of divalent cations (Il Kim et al., 2021). Alginate gel has received extensive attention in the field of tissue engineering due to its excellent biocompatibility and controllable release characteristics as a carrier of living cells (Nguyen and Anker, 2014). In addition, as a tough, elastic, non-thermally reversible colloidal material, alginate gel is favored in agriculture and food fields because of its use to encapsulate metabolites such as endosulfan, curcumin, and astaxanthin (Bozanic et al., 2009; Song et al., 2012, 2020). However, the slow and uncontrollable degradation of alginate gel has become the main factor limiting its development (Kunjukunju et al., 2018). Compared with nonenzymatic degradation, enzymatic degradation is less stimulating to cells and can control the release rates of small molecular compounds, which has become a hot spot in current research.\nAmong the thousands of alginate lyases that have been discovered, only a few can degrade alginate gel, such as alginate lyase (AL) from Sphingobacterium multivorum (Nguyen and Anker, 2014) and alginate lyase from Flavobactierium (Kunjukunju et al., 2018). Alginate lyases are polysaccharide lyases that specifically degrade alginate and mainly come from marine microorganisms, marine mollusks, and brown algae (Wong et al., 2000; Ertesvag, 2015). They degrade the 1,4- glycosidic bond through a \u03b2-elimination reaction to form an unsaturated double bond between C4 and C5, generating a 4-deoxy-L-erythro-hex-4-enopyranosyluronic acid at the nonreducing end (Preiss and Ashwell, 1962a). Alginate lyases are important in the marine carbon cycle (Matos et al., 2016) and have been widely applied in biochemistry, medicine, and energy (Chen et al., 2017; Tang et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2020). Based on substrate specificity, alginate lyases are classified as polyM-specific (EC 4.2.2.3), polyG-specific (EC 4.2.2.11), and bifunctional, which can degrade both polyM and polyG (EC 4.2.2.-). According to sequence similarities, alginate lyases are classified into 13 polysaccharide lyase (PL) families (PL5, 6, 7, 14, 15, 17, 18, 31, 32, 34, 36, 39, and 41) in the Carbohydrate-Active enZYmes (CAZy) database1 (Lombard et al., 2014).\nWith the deepening of research, it has been discovered that in addition to catalytic domains (CD), some multimodule alginate lyases have non-catalytic regions (NCRs). The carbohydratebinding module (CBM), as an important type of NCR, is currently further subdivided into 88 different CBM families in the CAZy database. CBMs do not have the catalytic ability but may have various effects on enzyme characteristics, such as targeting substrates (Lyu et al., 2018), disrupting insoluble substrate structures (Bernardes et al., 2019), or regulating activity (Zhang et al., 2019). Among them, CBM_4_9, CBM13, CBM16, and CBM32 are the most common alginate lyases. Although studies have shown that CBMs in alginate lyases influence enzyme activity, substrate-specific recognition and product distribution of soluble alginate, such as CBM_4_9 from Aly1 (Cheng et al., 2017), CBM13 from AlyL2 (Li et al., 2015), and CBM32 from TsAly7B (Zhang et al., 2019), the effect of CBMs on alginate gel is still unclear.\n1http://www.cazy.org/\nIn this study, we screened the high-producing alginate lyase Vibrio xiamenensis QY104. The fermentation broth was purified to obtain the native enzyme VxAly7B. Temperature and time were the main factors that affected the spontaneous cleavage of VxAly7B. Through genome sequencing and analysis, VxAly7B was found to include CBM32 and PL7 catalytic domains. To explore the function of CBM32 in depth, we cloned and purified the full-length sequence of VxAly7B (VxAly7B-FL) and two truncated mutants: VxAly7B-CM (PL7) and VxAly7B-CBM (CBM32). The results show that CBM32 plays an important role in the characteristics of VxAly7B, especially in the degradation of alginate gel. This study is an important exploration of the effect of CBM32 on alginate gel, provides new ideas and possibilities for the further application of alginate gel and expands the application of insoluble substrates in production."

The three-step purification of the crude enzyme increased the specific activity by 27 times, and the yield was 47.47% (Table 1). The characteristics of native alginate lyase from 12.5% SDS-PAGE showed that it is composed of two peptides with molecular weights of approximately 48 and 34 kDa (Figure 1A). To determine the properties of the two peptides, the production of native enzyme was analyzed by in-gel renaturation during the culture of V. xiamenensis QY104. The results showed that with the extension of culture time, the \u223c48 kDa band gradually transformed into two bands with alginate lyase activity, which were \u223c48 and 34 kDa, respectively. In addition, the \u223c34 kDa band gradually increased (Figure 1B). The antiserum was further prepared with\nnative enzyme, and the Western blot results showed that both bands were positive (Figure 1C). Therefore, we speculated that the\u223c34 kDa band might come from the\u223c48 kDa band.\nBy analyzing the genome sequence of V. xiamenensis QY104, we found an open reading frame (ORF) with a length of 1,359 bp, encoding 452 amino acid residues, which was named vxaly7b. VxAly7B has a theoretical molecular mass of 47.84 kDa, which is consistent with the size of the above band (\u223c48 kDa). To verify whether the 34 kDa band comes from VxAly7B, we performed N-terminal sequencing on the 34 kDa band and mass spectrometry-based de novo sequencing of the intermediate peptide (Supplementary Table 2). The results showed that the amino acid sequence completely corresponds to the amino acid sequence I155-Y452 of VxAly7B. Based on the above results, it is suggested that the 34 kDa band comes from the spontaneous cleavage of VxAly7B. In addition, we explored the factors of VxAly7B spontaneous cleavage. The results showed that VxAly7B completely cleaves when incubated at 16\u25e6C for 48 h or 25\u25e6C for 24 h (Figure 1D), suggesting that the extension of time and the rise of temperature would accelerate the cleavage of VxAly7B."

Ca2+ could promote their activities, while other metal ions (Zn2+, Ni2+, Cu2+, Fe3+, etc.), and EDTA and SDS inhibited their activities (Table 3).\nThe modes of action of recombinant VxAly7B-FL and VxAly7B-CM were determined by measuring the viscosity and absorbance at 235 nm of reaction mixtures during degradation. Absorbance at 235 nm increased steadily throughout the entire degradation process; however, viscosity decreased rapidly within the first 10 min and slowly in the latter 50 min (Supplementary Figure 5), suggesting that they act as endo-type alginate lyases. The end products of recombinant VxAly7B-FL and VxAly7B-CM were analyzed by gel filtration chromatography and negative ion ESI-MS. Peak area analysis demonstrated that the molar ratios of the end products (di-, tri-, tetra- and pentasaccharides) by recombinant VxAly7B-FL and VxAly7BCM were 2.59:1.48:1.27:1 and 2.73:1.87:1.52:1, respectively (Figure 3). The above results indicated that CBM32 does not affect the mode of action and degradation product distribution of VxAly7B."

The migration of recombinant VxAly7B-CM was also slowed, but to a lesser extent (Figures 4C,D).

(H) Substrate specificity of recombinant VxAly7B-FL and VxAly7B-CM toward alginate, polyM, and polyG.\nWe also prepared insoluble substrate alginate gel beads to investigate whether CBM32 enhances the affinity between VxAly7B and insoluble alginate gel. The recombinant proteins were incubated with alginate gel beads at 4\u25e6C for 3 h. After centrifugation, the unbound proteins in the supernatants were measured by SDS-PAGE. The results showed that recombinant VxAly7B-FL and VxAly7B-CBM could be completely combined with alginate gel beads, while VxAly7B-CM was partially combined, which proved that CBM32 could promote the combination of VxAly7B with alginate gel (Figure 4E). Simultaneously, the Langmuir-type adsorption isotherm was used to calculate the adsorption parameters to quantitatively evaluate the binding effect of VxAly7B-FL, VxAly7B-CM, and VxAly7B-CBM on the insoluble alginate gel. The maximum adsorption capacity of recombinant VxAly7B-FL on alginate\ngel beads (4,285 nmol/g substrate) was much higher than that of VxAly7B-CM (2,779 nmol/g substrate) but lower than that of VxAly7B-CBM (14,489 nmol/g substrate). The theoretical binding capacity of VxAly7B-CBM was the highest, which was 3.3-fold that of VxAly7B-FL and 5.2-fold that of VxAly7B-CM.\nTo prove whether CBM32 enhanced the activity of the catalytic domain of VxAly7B on insoluble substrates, the degradation process of recombinant VxAly7B-FL, VxAly7BCM, and VxAly7B-CBM on insoluble alginate gel beads were determined. The morphological changes of the gel beads were observed and recorded every 0.5 h. The results showed that the alginate gel beads of the control group supplemented with PB did not change from 0 to 3 h (Figure 5A). The alginate gel beads for the experimental group with added recombinant VxAly7B-FL obviously swelled and broke in 1 h and were completely broken at 3 h (Figure 5A). However, the alginate gel beads with added recombinant VxAly7B-CM changed slowly and swelled and broke in 3 h (Figure 5A). Correspondingly, the alginate gel beads with added recombinant VxAly7B-CBM swelled but did not break, and their diameter swelled from 2 mm to approximately 4 mm in 3 h.\nTo further determine the degradation ability of the recombinant protein toward alginate gel beads, the change in reducing sugar content in the product in the reaction system was measured.

The catalytic process of the recombinant enzyme on the alginate gel beads and the determination of the reducing sugar content showed that the recombinant VxAly7B-FL has a stronger ability to degrade insoluble alginate gel beads. It was found that CBM32 can promote the degradation of insoluble alginate gel. These results revealed that CBM32 might improve the degradation efficiency of VxAly7B toward alginate gel beads by swelling the alginate gel beads and concentrating the enzyme on the substrate."

            "text": "In our study, we characterized the alginate lyase VxAly7B from V. xiamenensis QY104 and its truncated mutants and found that CBM32 in VxAly7B exhibits different biochemical characteristics for soluble and insoluble substrates. As an auxiliary module, the CBM domain is essential in the process of binding to\ninsoluble substrates. The CBM54 domain from laminarinase Lic16A could bind a variety of insoluble polysaccharides but cannot bind soluble polysaccharides and oligosaccharides (Voronina and Pshennikova, 2010). CBM1 from ThCBM1Cel7A and ThCBM1Cel7B bound irreversibly to the insoluble substrate, thereby disrupting insoluble polysaccharide structures and leading to its amorphization (Bernardes et al., 2019). Endoguluronate lyase from Zobellia galactanivorans DsiJT and Aly7D from Saccharophagus degradans 2\u201340, which contain CBM32, could effectively destroy the Laminaria digitata recalcitrant cell wall, while other alginate lyases without CBM32, such as PA1167 from Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 and A1m from Agarivorans sp. JAM-A1m had no effect (Costa et al., 2021). Therefore, we speculate that CBM32 plays a significant role in the degradation of insoluble alginate.\nWe used the alginate lyase VxAly7B to determine the function of CBM32 on the insoluble substrate alginate gel. High molecular weight alginate has many Ca2+-binding sites and can form a dense gel form with a permeable network structure of high\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 9 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 798819\nwater holding capacity, strength, and elasticity with Ca2+(Cao et al., 2020). The spatial structure of this Egg-box model made the alginate gel beads have no obvious morphological changes in PB (Figure 5A). By measuring the binding and degradation ability of insoluble alginate gel beads by recombinant VxAly7BFL, VxAly7B-CM, and VxAly7B-CBM, it was found that CBM32 could efficiently bind insoluble alginate gel beads and promote the degradation of the gel beads by the PL7 catalytic domain (Figures 4E, 5, 6). This is a breakthrough in the functional identification of CBM32 in alginate lyase toward insoluble alginate gel. In addition to the interaction of Ca2+ with the carboxyl groups in alginate, hydrogen bonds, van der Waals forces, and/or hydrophobic interactions also contribute to the formation of gels (Kastner et al., 2012). Interference with these stable interactions might destroy the dense network structure of alginate gel. The crystal structure of CBM32 in the alginate lyase AlyQ from Persicobacter sp. CCB-QB2 showed that N206, D209 and T307 (corresponding to N43, D46, and T151 in CBM32 of VxAly7B) coordinate with Ca2+ (Sikorski et al., 2007; Sim et al., 2017; Cao et al., 2020). W129 of CBM32 in AlyB from Vibrio spendidus 12B01 (corresponding to W118 in CBM32 of VxAly7B) might interact with negatively charged alginate (Lyu et al., 2018). Therefore, when the recombinant VxAly7B-CBM was incubated with alginate gel beads, the potential amino acid residues of CBM32 in VxAly7B could interact with Ca2+ and substrate in alginate gel, which might destroy the gel structure of alginate gel beads, resulting in structural change, permeability enhancement, and morphological swell. The structure of the loose alginate gel beads might further expose the alginate group to facilitate the degradation of the substrate by the PL7 catalytic domain (Figure 6).\nHowever, the effect of CBM32 on soluble alginate in different alginate lyases showed different characteristics, which might be due to the structural differences between different CBM32, or the\ncomplex interaction between CBM32 and the catalytic domain. CBM32 of AlyM reduced the specific activity and temperature stability of the enzyme and increased the affinity toward polyM (Yang et al., 2019), while CBM32 of Dp0100 and AlyB promoted the binding and catalysis abilities (Lyu et al., 2018; Ji et al., 2019). Compared with AlyQC without CBM32, the Km, kcat and kcat/Km of AlyQBC were increased, indicating that CBM32 in AlyQBC was not conducive to the binding of the enzyme to the substrate but helped the enzyme to catalyze the substrate (Sim et al., 2017). In our study, CBM32 had no obvious effect on the optimal temperature, pH, and substrate preference of VxAly7B, but it significantly reduced the temperature stability of VxAly7B. When recombinant VxAly7B-FL and VxAly7B-CM were incubated for 1 h at 40\u25e6C, approximately 87% of the enzymatic activity of VxAly7B-CM was retained, while for VxAly7B-FL only 16% was retained (Figure 2F). Importantly, CBM32 of VxAly7B was not conducive to the binding and catalysis of soluble alginate by recombinant VxAly7B. The substrate-binding and catalytic abilities of recombinant VxAly7B-FL were both higher than those of recombinant VxAly7B-CM (Table 2). Similar results also appeared in the alginate lyase AlyH of Marinimicrobium sp. H1 (Yan et al., 2019). The results showed that AlyH-I without CBM32 exhibited lower Km and higher kcat/Km than AlyH-II with CBM32. Overall, CBM32 could promote the binding and catalytic abilities of VxAly7B to insoluble alginate, but it was not conducive to the degradation of soluble alginate. This feature might be closely related to the spontaneous cleavage of VxAly7B.\nIn addition, we purified the native alginate lyase VxAly7B from the fermentation broth of V. xiamenensis QY104 (Figure 1A). Spontaneous cleavage occurred during the fermentation process and was increased with time. Such cleavage of CBM32 was demonstrated in both native and recombinant VxAly7B (Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure 4). Although the mechanism of the spontaneous cleavage of VxAly7B is still\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 10 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 798819\nunclear, we found that the reaction was slow and the increase in temperature and the extension of time will accelerate its progress (Figure 1D and Supplementary Figure 4). The internal cleavage of CBM54 of laminarinase Lic16A and chitinase ChiW is a common feature, and the spontaneous cleavage of CBM54 is essential for the combination of the catalytic module and insoluble polysaccharides (Itoh et al., 2014; Dvortsov et al., 2018). The N-terminal extension (CBM_4_9 module) of AlyA and aly-SJ02 helps the protein to be folded correctly and then breaks, which is a common phenomenon of PL18 family alginate lyases (Matsushima et al., 2010; Dong et al., 2014). Unlike the internal cleavage of some other CBMs, the spontaneous cleavage of CBM32 is not a uniform feature in the family. Most of CBM32 exists stably in alginate lyase (Lyu et al., 2018; Yan et al., 2019), only a few of CBM32 spontaneously cleaved from the alginate lyase, such as alginate lyase in Vibrio sp. QY102 (Sun et al., 2019) and VxAly7B in V. xiamenensis QY104. After the disordered region between the two modules was broken, the activity of the enzyme only containing the catalytic domain increased (Figure 6). The characteristics of CBM32 in different alginate lyases might be closely related to the growth environment of the strain or enzyme and its biological function. We speculated that in the early growth of V. xiamenensis QY104, to accelerate the expansion and degradation of the substrate, full-length VxAly7B utilizes CBM32 to efficiently bind insoluble alginate substrates such as laminarin. With the loosening of the substrate structure, CBM32 spontaneously cleaved, and a catalytic domain lacking CBM32 was obtained. The catalytic domain has higher activity and stability for soluble substrates and deeply degrades alginate to effectively produce a carbon source for bacterial growth. As an efficient catalytic tool, VxAly7B can not only degrade insoluble alginate but also quickly utilize soluble alginate, thus may assist the rapid degradation of brown algae."
