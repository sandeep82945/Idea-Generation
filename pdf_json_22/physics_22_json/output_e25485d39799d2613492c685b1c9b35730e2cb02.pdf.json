    "abstractText": "We investigate the impact of interactions between hidden sectors and the discovered Higgs boson h125, allowing for additional invisible decay channels of h125. We perform \u03c72-fits to the measurements of the Higgs-boson cross sections as a function of the invisible branching ratio and different combinations of coupling modifiers, where the latter quantify modifications of the couplings of h125 compared to the predictions of the Standard Model. We present generic results in terms of exclusion limits on the coupling modifiers and the invisible branching ratio of h125. Additionally, we apply our results to a variety of concrete model realizations containing a hidden sector: dark matter within Higgsand singlet-portal scenarios, models featuring (pseudo) Nambu\u2013 Goldstone bosons and two Higgs doublet extensions. One of the main conclusions of our work is that in a wide class of models the indirect constraints resulting from the measurements of the cross sections of h125 provide substantially stronger constraints on the invisible Higgs-boson branching ratio compared to the direct limits obtained from searches for the invisible decay of h125. However, we demonstrate that the presence of an invisible decay mode of h125 can also open up parameter space regions which otherwise would be excluded as a result of the indirect constraints. As a byproduct of our analysis, we show that in light of the new results from the LZ collaboration a fermionic DM candidate within the simplest Higgs-portal scenario is ruled out under standard assumptions.",

            "text": "In 2012 a particle was discovered at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) by both the ATLAS [1] and CMS collaborations [2] with a mass of about 125 GeV that within the current experimental uncertainties behaves in agreement with the predictions for a Higgs boson of the Standard Model (SM) of particle physics [3,4]. As a consequence, theories beyond the SM (BSM) in which the shortcomings of the SM can be addressed have to contain a particle that plays the role of the discovered Higgs boson h125. This is especially relevant for BSM theories in which h125 is coupled to so far unknown hidden sectors. If the hidden sector contains particles with masses below 125 GeV, modifications of the properties of h125 can be present as a result of exotic decays into lighter BSM states. Here it is important to note that, in addition to the fact that the exotic decays can be searched for at colliders, additional decay modes also suppress the ordinary decay modes of h125 into SM particles. Therefore, the discovered Higgs boson acts as a probe for new physics beyond\nthe SM (BSM), and the LHC plays a vital role (and will do so for many more years to come) in order to shed light on the existence of light hidden sectors that might have escaped discovery until today.\nA remarkable amount of experimental knowledge about the recently discovered Higgs boson has been gathered at the LHC within the last ten years, where nature was kind to us by choosing a Higgs-boson mass for which several production modes and decay channels of h125 as predicted by the SM can be observed at the LHC [5]. The Higgs boson has been discovered in the gluon-fusion production mode (ggH) with subsequent decay into di-photon pairs and via its decay into pairs of off-shell vector bosons giving rise to four-lepton final states [1,2].1 The fine mass resolution of the discovery channels permit a measurement of the mass of h125 at the sub-percent level [7,8]. As of today, in addition to the ggH production mode, the production via the (tree-level) couplings to vector bosons in the vector-boson fusion (VBF) mode and via production in association with a W - or a Z - boson (VH) have been observed with a statistical significance of 5\u03c3 or more [3,4]. Finally, although indirect experimental evidence for the coupling of h125 to top-quarks was already present as a consequence of the measurement of ggH production, the presence of a large Yukawa coupling of h125 to top quarks has also been directly confirmed by means of the observation of Higgs-boson production in association with a top-quark pair (ttH) [3,4]. With regards to the decays of h125, in addition to the decay modes into pairs of photons and off-shell vector bosons as stated above, more recently also the decays of h125 into pairs of bottom quarks and into pairs of tau leptons have been observed with a statistical significance at the level of 5\u03c3 [3,4], such that the presence of couplings to the third-generation quarks and charged leptons has been established. Finally, there is first experimental evidence, although not yet statistically significant enough for a discovery, for the presence of rare decays of h125 into pairs of muons [9] and of the decays into a photon and a Z -boson [10,11]. There is so far no statistically significant indication for exotic decay modes into hidden sectors, but the current experimental uncertainties leave room for such decays at the level of a few percent, as will be the main topic of this paper.\nOne of the most puzzling open problems of modern physics concerns the presence of a dark matter (DM) component in our universe, whose relative contribution to the total energy budget has been measured to a great accuracy by the Planck collaboration to be DMh2 = 0.11933 \u00b1 0.00091\n1 It is remarkable that the main discovery channel gg \u2192 h125 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 involves two loop-induced processes according to the fact that the Higgs-boson does not carry color- or electric charge. As a consequence, the Higgs boson is also a valuable probe for indirect effects of BSM particles that could leave their footprint exclusively via radiative corrections to such loop-induced couplings of h125 (see e.g. Ref. [6]). This possibility is, however, not further considered in this paper.\n[12]. According to the standard Weakly Interacting Massive Particles (WIMP) paradigm, such a dark component could have been produced by the well-known freeze-out mechanism, by decoupling from the SM thermal bath while becoming non-relativistic. This scenario has been extensively studied in the literature and strong constraints from dark matter direct detection experiment, such as LUX [13], Xenon1T [14], PandaX [15] and LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) [16], have pushed the most classic models towards corners of allowed parameter space [17\u201323]. The Higgs boson plays a central role in many theories attempting to solve the dark matter problem in this context as any generic theory containing a fundamental scalar could allow for this state to couple to the Higgs doublet via a quartic coupling. As the possibilities for a WIMP to carry a charge with respect to the SM gauge group are very constrained and limited [24\u201326], this coupling is one of the only options for a renormalizable coupling of SM singlet states to one of the SM fields, while respecting the SM gauge invariance [27]. This coupling plays a major role in the context of Higgs portal scenarios where a dark matter candidate interacts with the SM only via coupling to the Higgs sector [17,20,22,23,28].\nAssuming, as discussed above, the presence of a hidden sector which exclusively couples to the visible sector via the Higgs portal, Higgs-boson decays into particles of the hidden sector can be kinematically allowed. Here it should be noted that one motivation to investigate hidden sectors with BSM states in this mass range is that the strongest direct detection constraints can be evaded for dark-matter masses at the level of a few GeV or below. If the BSM particles are stable or sufficiently long-lived in order to escape the detector, so-called invisible (inv) decays of h125 are present which can be searched for at the LHC in final states with large missing transverse energy. Direct searches for the invisible decay of h125 have been performed by both the ATLAS and the CMS collaboration utilizing various different production modes. We summarize in Table 1 the current LHC searches for the invisible decay of h125 that include part or all of the Run 2 dataset at 13 TeV. No significant excesses over the SM background have been observed, such that upper limits on the branching ratio for the invisible decay of h125, denoted BRinv from hereon, have been determined (see last column of Table 1). Assuming that h125 couples to the SM fermions and gauge bosons according to the predictions of the SM, the currently strongest limit on BRinv was reported by ATLAS [33],\nBRinv < 11% at 95% confidence level (CL), (1.1)\nwhich was obtained by combining the datasets collected at 7, 8 and 13 TeV, and by utilizing the VBF and ttH production modes. In the following, we will refer to the constraint shown in Eq. (1.1) as the direct limit on BRinv, according to the fact\nTable 1 Expected (exp) and observed (obs) experimental upper limits at the 95% confidence level on the invisible branching ratio of h125 as reported by ATLAS and CMS, obtained from direct searches for the invisible decay of h125 at the LHC at \u221a s = 13 TeV. The currently strongest upper limit reported by each collaboration are marked with a\nstar. The production modes of h125 targeted in the different searches are vector-boson fusion (VBF), production in association with a Z -boson (ZH) or Z - and W -bosons (VH), and gluon-fusion production in association with a jet (ggHj)\nCollaboration \u221a s [TeV] Data [fb\u22121] h125 production Exp.

[17,19,21,38\u201340]). However, additional, although more model-dependent, constraints on BRinv arise from the cross-section measurements of h125, considering that additional BSM decay modes give rise to a suppression of the ordinary decay modes of h125. By performing global scans to the LHC Higgs-boson measurements in terms of BRinv and so-called coupling modifiers that quantify deviations of the couplings of h125 with respect to the SM predictions, one can set limits on BRinv as a function of the coupling modifiers (see, e.g. Refs. [41\u201346] for earlier analyses of this kind). Since in this approach the measurements of the ordinary decay modes of h125 are used to constrain BRinv, in contrast to directly searching for the invisible decay of h125, we will refer to the limits on BRinv resulting from the global analysis of the cross-section measurements as the indirect constraints in the following.\nIn this paper our goal is to exploit the complementarity of the direct and the indirect constraints on BRinv. To this end, the first step of our analysis is to determine the indirect constraints on BRinv via global fits to the cross-section measurements of h125, where we will make use of the public code HiggsSignals v.3 [47]. We perform such global scans assuming that the couplings of h125 remain unchanged compared to the couplings of a SM Higgs boson, but also assuming more complicated Higgs-portal models in which, in addition to the presence of an invisible decay mode, there are modifications of the couplings of h125 to the fermions\nand gauge bosons.2 If coupling modifications are considered, the upper limit on BRinv is a function of the coupling modifiers. Having determined the indirect constrains on BRinv, we then compare them to the direct limit on BRinv in order to investigate which of the two kind of constraints results in a stronger exclusion in a variety of different BSM scenarios. To give a brief outlook on the key results that we have found, we emphasize already here that in many of the Higgs-portal scenarios considered in the literature the indirect constraints can provide substantially stronger exclusions and should therefore not be overlooked. However, in models in which the properties of h125 are not as predicted by the SM, we also found parameter space regions that are in conflict with the LHC Higgs-boson measurements if there is no invisible decay mode of h125, whereas the same parameter regions are well in agreement with the LHC measurements if a value of BRinv at the level of a few percent is present.\nThe outline of the paper is as follow. In Sect. 2 we describe the setup and approach used to derive the indirect constraints on BRinv as a function of the couplings modifiers, thus accounting for deviations with respect to the SM expectation of the couplings of h125 to the SM fields. We present generic constraints in terms of the coupling modifiers and the invisible branching fraction for a different set of assumption regarding the structure of the coupling modifiers. Going beyond this generic framework, we analyse in Sect. 3 the constraints in a variety of concrete BSM scenarios: Higgs- and singlet-mediated dark matter models, constructions featuring (pseudo) Nambu\u2013Goldstone bosons, and extended Higgs sectors featuring a second Higgs doublet. In Sect. 4, we summarize our main results and conclude.\n2 Similar analyses have been performed, for instance, in Refs. [42,46, 48,49], and more recently both CMS and ATLAS presented constraints on BRinv obtained in the so-called \u03ba-framework [3,4].\n2 Indirect limits on the invisible decay of the Higgs boson h125\nAs mentioned above, in the first step of our analysis we will remain agnostic about the precise nature of the hidden sector. Instead of specifying a concrete model, we perform \u03c72-fits to the measurements of the Higgs boson h125 as a function of the branching ratio for invisible decay modes of h125 and, in addition, as a function of coupling modifiers that quantify modifications of the couplings of h125 compared to the SM predictions. These \u03c72-analyses, for which we make use of the public code HiggsSignals v.3 [46,47,50] (see the discussion below for details), will be discussed in this section. The \u03c72-analyses provide us with 68% and 95% confidencelevel (CL) upper limits on BRinv as a function of the coupling modifiers. These upper limits can be compared to the upper limits on the invisible branching ratio resulting from directsearches for the decays of h125 into invisible final state. At a later stage of our analysis, discussed in Sect. 3, we will apply the constraints on the invisible branching ratio BRinv that we obtained from the global \u03c72-fit to a range of commonly studied hidden sectors possessing dark matter candidates, extended scalar content (2HDM) and pseudo Nambu\u2013 Goldstone bosons, in which the Higgs portal plays a major role.\nBefore starting the discussion of the results of the \u03c72analyses, we briefly discuss the strategy that is implemented in the public code HiggsSignals, and which is used here in order to compare the predicted cross sections and signal rates of h125 to the experimental measurements. For a more detailed description of the code, we refer the reader to Ref. [47] (see also Ref. [46] for a more detailed discussion on the statistical interpretation of the \u03c72-values provided by HiggsSignals). The code contains a large set of experimental data from LHC measurements at 8 TeV and (mostly) 13 TeV center-of-mass energy.3 The measurements are implemented not only in the form of inclusive cross sections (or signal rates), but also in the form of the simplified template cross sections [51] which were designed to allow for a combination of measurements of different decay channels of h125. In total, the HiggsSignals dataset currently comprises 24 independent measurements from the CMS and the ATLAS collaborations. For the purpose of our paper, as will be discussed in detail below, the most important measurements are the ones utilizing the di-photon final state due to the sensitivity of the di-photon branching ratio on the presence of BSM decay modes of h125.\nOn the theory side, in order to compare the model predictions to the experimental data, HiggsSignals requires as input either directly the signal rates (or alternatively the cross\n3 The data repository of HiggsSignals can be found at https:// gitlab.com/higgsbounds/hsdataset.\nsections and branching ratios) of h125 in the various different production or decay modes, or the user has the option to provide effective coupling modifiers from which the cross sections and branching ratios are derived internally by a rescaling of the SM predictions. The coupling modifiers are defined as the couplings of the particle state at 125 GeV in the given BSM theory normalized to the couplings of a SM Higgs boson at the same mass (see below for details). Thus, in order to check the SM against the experimental data, one would choose all modifiers to be equal to one, whereas in models that feature modifications of the properties of h125 the couplings modifiers deviate from one. In our analysis, we will combine both input formats. This is possible since the most recent update of HiggsSignals, which is now incorporated into the public code HiggsTools [47]. We make use of the input in terms of the coupling modifiers in order to obtain the LHC cross sections of h125 and in order to calculate the partial decay widths of all conventional decay modes of h125 into SM particles. Subsequently, in order to set the desired value of the branching ratio for the additional decay mode into invisible final states, we give the respective partial decay width inv as input. The partial width inv that is required to set a desired value of BRinv can be calculated as\ninv = BRinv 1 \u2212 BRinv\n\u2211\ni\nSMi , (2.1)\nwhere SMi stands for the individual partial widths for decays of h125 into SM final states, which were calculated previously as a function of the coupling modifiers. Accordingly, the sum runs over all relevant SM decay modes of h125, i.e. i = {bb\u0304, gg,WW \u2217, Z Z\u2217, cc\u0304, ss\u0304, \u03c4+\u03c4\u2212, \u03b3 \u03b3, \u03bc+\u03bc\u2212, Z\u03b3 }. The total width of h125 is then given by\ntot = inv + \u2211\ni\nSMi . (2.2)\nAs already discussed in the introduction, the fact that the total width of h125 is modified via the presence of the additional contribution inv gives rise to the fact that BRinv can be constrained via the measured cross sections and signal rates of h125.\nIn order to capture the coupling modifications that arise in as many UV-complete models as possible while maintaining a manageable number of free parameters, we define four independent coupling modifiers ci , with i = V, u, d, . The coefficients ci modify the couplings of the discovered Higgs boson h125 to the SM mass eigenstates according to\nL = \u2211\nf =u,d, c f\n(m f v ) h125 f\u0304 f + cV\n( 2m2W\nv\n) h125 W +\u03bcW\u2212\u03bc\n+ cV ( m2Z v ) h125 Z \u03bcZ\u03bc + Linv, (2.3)\nwhere cV , cu , cd and c are, respectively, the coupling modifier of the massive gauge bosons, to up-type quarks, to downtype quarks and charged leptons.4 Linv is the contribution that contains the portal couplings to the hidden sector responsible for the presence of the invisible branching ratio BRinv, which we will further specify when we consider concrete BSM theories in Sect. 3. For the loop-induced couplings of h125 to photons and gluons, we assume that there are no sizable BSM contributions in additions to the loop diagrams with SM particles in the loops, reflecting the fact that light hidden-sector particles can only couple very weakly via the SM gauge interactions in order to be physically viable. Hence, the respective coupling coefficients c\u03b3 \u03b3 and cgg can be calculated as a function of cV , cu and cd .5 The structure of the coupling modifiers in the various BSM theories considered in this work are summarized in Table 2.\nAs already mentioned above, in order to derive the indirect limits on BRinv from the measurements related to h125 we perform a \u03c72-analysis utilizing the public code HiggsSignals. We determine in each scan\n\u03c72 (ci , BRinv) = \u03c72 (ci , BRinv) \u2212 \u03c72SM, (2.4) where \u03c72(ci , BRinv) is the fit result for the respective BSM scenario given as a function of the coupling modifiers ci and BRinv, and \u03c72SM is the fit result assuming properties of h125 as predicted by the SM, i.e. BRinv = 0 and ci = 1.6 In order to set limits on the coupling modifiers or model parameters, we demand that the BSM scenario is not disfavoured compared to the SM fit result at the 95% CL or more. In a one-dimensional parameter estimation, this translates into the condition [53]\n\u03c72 \u2264 3.84. (2.5) In a joint estimation of two free parameters, the respective condition is\n\u03c72 \u2264 5.99. (2.6) In addition to the allowed regions of the coupling modifiers obtained using the 95% CL conditions, we will show in our plots also allowed regions using the 68% (1\u03c3 ) CL for illustrative reasons, which corresponds to the conditions \u03c72 \u2264 1\n4 Consequently, we do not take into account flavour-dependent modifications to the Higgs-boson couplings. We also do not consider possible sources of CP violation, such that h125 is assumed to be a purely CPeven state. 5 The contributions from the charged leptons can safely be neglected due to the suppression from the smaller Yukawa couplings Y Yt , Yb. 6 Strictly speaking, also in the SM one finds BRinv > 0 due to the decay mode h125 \u2192 Z Z\u2217 \u2192 \u03bd\u03bd\u03bd\u0304\u03bd\u0304. However, the resulting branching ratio is of the order of 0.1% [52]. Considering the current experimental precisions of the signal-rate measurements of h125, this value can be approximated by zero for all practical purposes.\nand \u03c72 \u2264 2.30 in one-dimensional and two-dimensional fits, respectively [53].\nBy defining the allowed/excluded regions for the coupling modifiers based on the \u03c72-definition shown in Eq. (2.4), where we utilize the SM as a reference model, the obtained limits only correspond to the 95% CL limits if the SM result \u03c72SM is a good approximation of the best-fit result of the BSM scenario under consideration, i.e. \u03c72min = min(\u03c72) \u03c72SM. As we will discuss below, we encountered situations in which \u03c72min was considerably smaller than \u03c7 2 SM for certain parameter configurations.7 In such a situation, the more common approach (in a frequentist analysis) would be to construct the confidence intervals of the free parameters by comparing to the parameter point that features the best-fit value \u03c72min instead of comparing to \u03c72SM > \u03c7 2 min, i.e. constructing the limits based on \u03c72 = \u03c72\u2212\u03c72min. This approach would yield stronger constraints on the parameters and therefore smaller allowed regions in the ci parameter space as compared to our approach, such that the latter should be regarded as more conservative. We found that the experimental measurements responsible for values of \u03c72 < 0 are mainly the ones related to the ttH production of h125, where the signal extraction is affected by systematic uncertainties regarding the theoretical predictions for the background estimation [54,55]. Taking this into account, it is reasonable to be conservative in the determination of the exclusion limits, thus sticking to the definition of \u03c72 as shown in Eq. (2.4), even though \u03c72min is smaller than \u03c72SM in some scenarios. We also note that in our plots we indicate the \u03c72-distribution together with the value of \u03c72min for all parameter points in addition to the 68% CL and 95% CL exclusions, such that the reader can also apply a different criterion in order to define the allowed regions. Finally, it should also be noted that the opposite case with \u03c72min > \u03c7 2 SM is not possible for the different BSM scenarios considered in the following, because in the fits of the BSM theories in terms of the coupling modifiers we always include the parameter space point ci = 1 and BRinv = 0 in which the particle state h125 resembles exactly the properties of a SM Higgs boson.\nAs was already mentioned above, we start our analysis be performing the \u03c72-fits in different BSM scenarios in a generic fashion in terms of the coupling modifiers ci . The different scenarios are discussed in the following subsections. We summarize in Table 2 the different constructions of coupling modifications that we consider. The applications\n7 We emphasize that \u03c72min < \u03c7 2 SM does not necessarily signify a global statistical preference of the respective BSM scenario compared to the SM, as such a conclusion can only be drawn by also taking into account the different numbers of degrees of freedom of both models. For the context of our analysis, in which we are interested only in the constraints on the coupling modifiers and BRinv that can be derived within a certain BSM scenario, the global preference of different BSM scenarios against the SM (and also against each other) is not relevant.\nTable 2 Summary of the coupling modifications in terms of the modifiers defined in Eq.

As a result, the cross sections at colliders for the production of h125 are unchanged compared to the SM predictions. However, as discussed above, the branching ratios of h125 can be modified due to additional decay modes into the hidden sector if such decay modes are kinematically allowed. In this case, the modifications of the properties of h125 compared to the SM predictions can be quantified exclusively in terms of the invisible branching ratio BRinv. In the following we will discuss how non-zero values of BRinv give rise to a suppression of the signal rates in the conventional decay modes of h125. By comparing the predicted signal rates to the experimental measurements, we will derive an upper limit on BRinv at the 95% CL via the condition shown in Eq. (2.5). Finally, we will compare the indirect limit resulting from the global Higgs-boson measurements to the direct limit on BRinv from direct searches for the invisible decay of h125.\nTo this end, we show in Fig. 1 the results of the \u03c72-analysis performed with HiggsSignals, where we set ci = 0, and we varied BRinv from 0 to 18%. The black solid line indicates the value of \u03c72, which is obtained including the complete data set implemented in HiggsSignals. We find the bestfit with \u03c72 = 0 at BRinv = 0, with \u03c72min = \u03c72SM = 151.67. For increasing values of BRinv the \u03c72 function is monotonically increasing. Consequently, under the assumption that the couplings of h125 are unchanged compared to the SM predictions, the presence of an invisible decay mode of h125 with sizable branching ratio worsens the fit result to the Higgs-\nFig. 1 Result of the global fit to the Higgs boson signal-rate measurements assuming a Higgs boson h125 that apart from the presence of an invisible decay mode behaves according to the predictions of the SM model, i.e. the couplings of h125 to the SM particles are unchanged. The black solid line indicates the value \u03c72 taking into account the full HiggsSignals data set. The black dashed and the black dotted lines indicate the value of \u03c72 considering only the measurements in the diphoton final state utilizing the full Run 2 data by CMS [56] and ATLAS [57], respectively. The gray horizontal lines indicate the 68% and 95% CL, respectively. The orange vertical line indicates the currently strongest upper limit on BRinv resulting from direct searches for h125 \u2192 inv as published by ATLAS [33]\nboson measurements for all possible values of BRinv. Based on the HiggsSignals analysis, we find an indirect upper limit of\nBRinv < 6.22% (3.08%) at 95% (68%) CL for ci = 1. (2.7)\nThe 95% CL limit is almost a factor of two smaller than the currently strongest limits from direct searches for the decay mode h125 \u2192 inv (see Table 1). The strongest direct limit BRinv < 11% is indicated by the orange dotted-dashed vertical line in Fig. 1 [33]. Accordingly, for phenomenological studies of models with hidden sectors in which the couplings of h125 are not modified compared to the SM predictions, but\nwhere the decay of h125 into the hidden sector is kinematically open, one should include the indirect constraints from the measurements of the signal rates of h125, currently giving rise to the upper limit shown in Eq. (2.7). On the contrary, taking into account only the limit on BRinv from direct searches allows also parameter space regions that are already excluded by the measurements regarding the discovered Higgs boson at a CL of more than 3\u03c3 , i.e. \u03c72 > 9, as is visible in Fig. 1.\nIn order to shed light on which particular measurements are most relevant for the increase of \u03c72 with increasing values of BRinv, we show in Fig. 1 the \u03c72-values that are obtained only taking into account the measurement with the largest and the second largest individual contributions to the total \u03c72.8 The most important \u03c72-penalty has its origin in the CMS measurement of Higgs-boson production and subsequent decay into di-photon pairs including the full Run 2 data at 13 TeV center of mass energy [56]. The fit to the corresponding cross-section measurements gives rise to the \u03c72 values indicated by the black dashed line in Fig. 1. One can see that based on this measurement alone one obtains a stronger upper limit on BRinv than the one obtained from direct searches for h125 \u2192 inv. Also the second largest \u03c72penalty is caused by signal rates of h125 utilizing the diphoton decay mode, but here as a result of the corresponding ATLAS measurements [57], indicated by the black dotted line in Fig. 1. The fact that the two most relevant measurements are both related to the h125 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 decay mode can be understood by realizing that, from the experimental side, it is the most precisely measured decay mode, and that, from the theory side, the di-photon branching ratio is very sensitive to modifications of the total width of h125.\nWe finally compare the indirect limit on BRinv to similar results that have been obtained in the past and to projections for future runs of the LHC and for the high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC). An early analysis including Tevatron and LHC first-year Run 1 data found a limit of BRinv \u2264 23% via a global fit to the Higgs-boson data assuming SMlike couplings [43]. Shortly after, in Ref. [44] a slightly stronger limit of BRinv \u2264 17% was found making use of HiggsSignals using the same fit strategy as applied here. Taking into account the full Run 1 LHC data, an upper limit of BRinv \u2264 12% has been determined in Ref. [49]. Global fits including also 13 TeV LHC data have been performed in Refs. [45,46], finding upper limits on BRinv under the assumption of SM-like couplings of 5% and 10%, respectively. These numbers are of comparable size as the limit BRinv \u2264 6.2% found in this analysis.\n8 The total \u03c72-value including all measurements (black solid line) can be smaller than the sum of the two individual contributions from the h125 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 measurements (black dashed and dotted lines) shown in Fig. 1, because for the computation of the total \u03c72-values the correlations are taken into account.\nIt is interesting to note that the current indirect limits are also comparable to the HL-LHC projections assuming that 3000 fb\u22121 will be collected at 14 TeV [58]. The reason for this is mainly that the projected limits on BRinv were obtained under the assumptions that the experimental data will be in agreement with the SM predictions, whereas the current limits on BRinv have been determined from actual data in which the central values of the various measurements naturally fluctuate within statistical and systematic uncertainties. If differences exist between the central values in the current data and the SM predictions (which are expected at least at the level of statistical fluctuations), the extracted upper limit on BRinv derived today can be smaller than the projected HL-LHC limit even though the precision of the individual cross-section measurements is larger now compared to what is expected in the future for the HL-LHC. This also means that, even though the uncertainties of the cross-section measurements of h125 will improve in the future, the indirect limit on BRinv might not necessarily become substantially stronger, because the limit will depend on how the measured central values of the cross sections will evolve within the current uncertainty bands.\n2.2 h125 with universally modified couplings and a non-zero BRinv\nIn the previous section we discussed the case in which the Higgs sector remained unchanged compared to the SM except for the presence of an additional invisible decay mode into a hidden sector. However, in many BSM scenarios additional scalar fields can mix with the SM-like Higgs boson at 125 GeV. In this case, the properties of h125 can be modified not only by additional decay modes into invisible final states, but also the couplings of h125 to the fermions and gauge bosons of the SM can be modified compared to the SM. In this section we will analyze the most simple possibility, in which the couplings of h125 to the SM particles are modified by a universal coupling modifier cuni = cV = cu = cd = c . The simplest UV-complete model in which this pattern of coupling modifiers arises is a model in which a gauge singlet scalar field mixes with h125, giving rise to a suppression of the couplings of h125 by a universal factor cuni < 1 which can be identified as cuni = cos \u03b8 where \u03b8 is the singlet mixing angle with h125. Models in which also a coefficient cuni > 1 can be realized comprise, for instance, extensions of the SM by a real or complex SU(2) triplet Higgs field.\nUnder the assumption of the universal coupling coefficient cuni and the presence of an invisible decay mode h125 \u2192 inv, we can perform a \u03c72-fit to the measurements of the properties of h125 in dependence of the two free parameters cuni and BRinv with the help of HiggsSignals. By doing so, we obtain the two-dimensional \u03c72-distribution that is shown in Fig. 2. In this plot the color grading indicates the value\nof \u03c72 in the parameter plane {cuni, BRinv}, and the solid and dashed lines indicate the 95% and the 68% CL limits, respectively. Also indicated with an orange star is the 95% CL upper limit BRinv < 11% which was obtained assuming a VBF production cross sections of h125 according to the SM prediction [33]. As such, the direct limit can in principle only be applied for cuni = 1, in which case the production cross sections of the state at 125 GeV considered here agree with the SM predictions. However, for cuni = 1 the direct limit on BRinv can still be applied in an approximate form. Taking into account that the VBF production cross sections is given by \u03c3VBF = c2uni \u00d7 \u03c3 SMVBF at leading order, with \u03c3 SMVBF being the SM cross section, the number of signal events would be enhanced or reduced by the factor c2uni depending on whether cuni is larger or smaller than one, respectively. Under the assumption that the kinematical shape of the signal events is not modified substantially, which can be expected to be the case for small deviations of cuni from unity, one can therefore apply the upper limit BRinv < 11%/c2uni from direct searches for h125 \u2192 inv in order to account for the modification of the production cross section \u03c3VBF if cuni = 1. We will call this limit an extrapolation of the direct limit on BRinv, and this extrapolated limit is shown as the orange dotted-dashed line in Fig. 2.\nOne can see in Fig. 2 that there is a flat direction with \u03c72 0 in the {cuni, BRinv} plane. Along this flat direction, values of cuni > 1 give rise to an enhancement of the cross sections for the production of h125, but at the same time values of BRinv > 0 suppress the decay modes of h125 decaying\ninto SM particles (see also Ref. [44]). As a result, for each value of cuni > 1 there is a value of BRinv > 0 for which production cross sections times branching ratios remain equal to the SM predictions. Accordingly, we find that in the range cuni 1.015 the direct upper limit on BRinv (orange lines) is stronger than the indirect limit on BRinv resulting from the fit to the signal-rate measurements of h125. For cuni 1.085 the values of BRinv that are required in order to cancel the enhancement of the production cross sections of h125 are larger than the direct limit, such that the combination of the indirect constraints from signal-rate measurements and the direct constraint on BRinv is able to exclude this part of the parameter plane entirely.\nIn contrast to the case with cuni > 1, in models in which the couplings of h125 are suppressed compared to the SM, i.e. cuni < 1, one can observe that the indirect limit on BRinv from the fit to the signal-rate measurements (black solid line) is always substantially stronger than the direct limit from searches for h125 \u2192 inv (orange dotted-dashed line). In this region of the parameter plane, both the values of cuni < 1 and BRinv > 0 give rise to a suppression of the signal rates of h125. This is why we observe that, the smaller the value of cuni, the smaller is the indirect upper limit on BRinv resulting from the signal-rate measurements of h125. Finally we note that, according to the discussion of Sect. 2.1, also for cuni = 1 the indirect limit is stronger than the direct limit, as indicated with the orange star.\nAn approximate estimate of the allowed parameter space, corresponding to the region delimited by the two black lines in Fig. 2, is given at 95% CL by the condition\n0.520 BRinv + 0.960 < cuni < 0.565 BRinv + 1.043. (2.8)\nThe fact that for cuni < 1 the indirect constraints provide the strongest constraints on BRinv, whereas the direct limits are (in the considered scenario) essentially irrelevant, is important for phenomenological studies in models with extended Higgs sectors featuring a gauge-singlet scalar. Then the deviations of the universal coupling modifier cuni to unity is generated via the mixing of the SM-like Higgs boson with the singlet scalar, and the coupling coefficient can be written as cuni = cos \u03b8 1 \u2212 \u03b82/2 for small \u03b8 , where \u03b8 is the mixing angle. In such case, the constraints from Eq. (2.8) translate in very good approximation into\nBRinv < 0.078\n( 1 \u2212 ( \u03b8\n0.285\n)2) , (2.9)\nwhich implies that in the limit BRinv \u2192 0 values \u03b8 < 0.285 are excluded and reciprocally if \u03b8 \u2192 0, BRinv is constrained to be BRinv < 0.078, which is stronger than all current direct\nbounds listed in Table 1.9 We will discuss the parameter constraints resulting from the analysis of this section in two concrete BSM theories, a hidden-sector composed of a fermionic DM candidate as well as a singlet scalar in Sect. 3.2, and a construction featuring (pseudo) Nambu\u2013Goldstone bosons in Sect. 3.3.\n2.3 h125 with non-universally modified couplings and a non-zero BRinv\nIn the previous section we investigated the case in which the couplings of the Higgs boson h125 are modified via a universal coupling coefficient cuni. Although this procedure captures the modifications that arise in many BSM constructions featuring additional scalars, there is also a wide range of models in which the modifications to the couplings of h125 compared to the SM prediction cannot be captured in terms of a single coefficient. Since it is not feasible to use independent coupling modifiers for each of the couplings of h125, we have to make assumptions on the total number of coupling modifiers that we include, and on how the couplings of h125 depend on these modifiers. As already discussed in Sect. 2, for the case of non-universal coupling modifiers we will consider the four independent coefficients cV , cu , cd and c defined in Eq. (2.3), and for the loop-induced couplings to gluons and photons we assume that no additional BSM loop-contributions play a role. Thus, including BRinv as an additional free parameter, HiggsSignals can be used to determine \u03c72 as a function of up to five independent parameters (see also Table 2 for a summary of the combinations of coupling modifiers for each case considered in this work). In order to be able to present the results in a clearer fashion, we will restrict our analysis in this section to parameter scans with only two independent coupling modifiers. The corresponding parameter space can be understood as a subspace of the more complicated coupling configurations allowed by the effective Lagrangian shown in Eq. (2.3), requiring further relations amongst the four individual coupling modifiers cV , cu , cd and c . This approach allows us to show the allowed regions of the two varied parameters in two-dimensional plots, and we can investigate how these regions change with increasing values of BRinv.\nAs a first example, we show constraints in a benchmark model commonly utilized by the CMS and the ATLAS collaborations (see, for instance, Refs. [3,4,59\u201361]), in which it is assumed that the couplings of h125 to fermions are modified by a common factor c f = cu = cd = c , and, in addition, the coupling to the massive vector bosons is allowed to vary,\n9 If the invisible decay of h125 is absent, and modifications of the properties of h125 arise only by means of a universal coupling modification, we find in a one-dimensional parameter estimation 95% CL limits of cuni > 0.968, or equivalently \u03b8 < 0.253.\ni.e. cV = 1. Such coupling modifications can be present in various different UV-complete BSM theories. For example, the presence of a gauge-singlet scalar that mixes with h125 gives rise to cV = c f < 1, as discussed in Sect. 2.2. Other examples comprise the 2HDM with Yukawa structure of type I and extensions thereof, where cV \u2264 1, and where c f can be both smaller and larger than 1. Also extensions of the SM containing SU(2) triplet scalar fields that mix with the SM Higgs field can give rise to coupling modifications in terms of cV and c f as discussed above, where in contrast to 2HDMs also cV > 1 is possible (at tree level). All these models can be extended by a hidden sector in order to feature one or more valid DM particles, and where the Higgs sector can act as the portal between the hidden and the SM sector (see, for instance, Refs. [62\u201365]). Thus, if the decay of h125 into states of the hidden sector is kinematically allowed, it is interesting to analyze how the experimental limits on the coupling modifiers are modified for different values of the invisible branching ratio of h125.\nIn Fig. 3 we show the values of \u03c72 as a function of cV and c f for different choices of BRinv. The upper left plot is obtained assuming that there is no invisible decay mode of h125, and the other plots are obtained by increasing BRinv in steps of 2% up to BRinv = 10% (lower right plot), covering the allowed range of BRinv according to the direct limits. The solid and the dashed contours indicate the 95% and 68% CL exclusion limits based on the HiggsSignals \u03c72-fit to the cross-section measurements of h125. One can see that with increasing value of BRinv the allowed regions of the coupling modifiers move to larger values. This observation is in line with the discussion in Sect. 2.2, where we demonstrated that the suppression of the decay modes into SM particles due to the presence of the invisible decay mode can be compensated by en enhancement of the production cross sections as a result of coupling modifiers larger than one (see also Fig. 2). In contrast to the location of the allowed regions, the shape and the size of the allowed regions are practically unchanged in all plots. Furthermore, also the values of \u03c72 featured by the best-fit points for the different values of BRinv are effectively the same. Based on the results shown in Fig. 3, one can conclude that for BSM scenarios in which the restriction cV \u2264 1 applies, the presence of the invisible decay mode gives rise to a decrease of the allowed ranges of both cV and c f . On the other hand, for models like the Higgs-triplet extension in which one can find values of cV > 1, one can see that the presence of an invisible decay mode of h125 with sizable branching ratios can open up parameter space regions that would be excluded if such a novel decay mode is not present. It should be noted also that the best-fit points do not lie at the point at which the couplings of h125 are identical to the SM predictions (black crosses) even if the decay mode h125 \u2192 inv is absent. Instead, for BRinv = 0% the parameter points with the smallest values of \u03c72 are found for cV > 1\nand c f < 1, featuring values of \u03c72 \u2248 \u22126.10 Hence, if one would define the exclusion regions based on \u03c72 = \u03c72 \u2212 \u03c72min, instead of \u03c7\n2 = \u03c72 \u2212\u03c72SM as applied throughout this paper, one would obtain even stronger exclusion limits in the {c f , cV } plane (see also the related discussion in Sect. 2). The location of the best-fit points as a function of BRinv moves to larger values of both coupling modifiers investigated here for increasing values of BRinv.\nA second BSM scenario that we consider is the case in which the coupling of h125 to gauge bosons is not modified compared to the SM predictions (cV = 1), in contrast to all the other scenarios discussed above, but in which the couplings to the fermions can deviate from the SM (cu, cd , c = 1). We furthermore impose the condition c = cd in order to 10 The values of \u03c72 < 0 are driven here by the following measurements, where for simplicity we only quote inclusive signal strength measurements here, and we remind the reader that \u03bc = 1 according to the SM predictions: (i) \u03bc(ttH, H \u2192 bb\u0304) = 0.35+0.36\u22120.34 reported by ATLAS [55], where it should be taken into account that the measurement uncertainty is dominated by systematic uncertainties regarding the background estimation, (ii) \u03bc(ggH, H \u2192 \u03c4+\u03c4\u2212) = 0.59+0.28\u22120.32 and \u03bc(VBF, H \u2192 \u03c4+\u03c4\u2212) = 1.39+0.56\u22120.47 reported by CMS [66], (iii) \u03bc(ttH) = 0.58+0.36\u22120.33 reported by ATLAS [54], where the signal extraction is affected by the fact that the ttW background was found to be larger than the SM prediction.\nstick to a parameter scan with two free parameters for a given value of BRinv. UV-complete models in which coupling modifications of this form arise comprise generically extensions of the SM containing a second SU(2) doublet scalar field in which the so-called Yukawa structure of type II (see Sect. 3.4 for details) is imposed, which is also the Yukawa structure that arises in supersymmetric extensions of the SM (see e.g. Ref. [67]). We show the \u03c72-distribution in the (cu, cd) for different values of BRinv as they were obtained with the help of HiggsSignals in Fig. 4, where the color coding and the definitions of the CL exclusion limits is as in Fig. 3. One can observe that increasing values of BRinv shifts the allowed parameter regions to larger values of cu and smaller values of cd = c . The reason for the preference of larger values of cu if BRinv > 0 lies in the fact that the enhancement of the coupling of h125 to top quarks gives rise to an enhancement of the gluon-fusion production cross section that partially compensates the suppression of the branching ratios for the ordinary decay modes of h125. However, the VBF production mode, for instance, is unchanged since cV = 1, such that the minimal values of \u03c72 that are found for each value of BRinv considered increase with BRinv, in contrast to the results depicted in Fig. 3. The trend towards lower values of cd with increasing values of BRinv has its origin in the fact\nthat a suppression of the coupling of h125 to bottom quarks suppresses the total width of h125. As a consequence, sizable values of the decay width inv (see Eq. (2.1)) can be in agreement with the signal-rate measurements of h125, because the measured branching ratios of the ordinary decays of h125 remain closer to the SM predictions. However, since cV = 1 and c = cd in this scenario, the suppression of the couplings of h125 to tau leptons if cd < 1, and the unchanged partial decay with for the decay modes h125 \u2192 W+W\u2212 and Z Z still result in significant modifications of the branching ratios of h125 compared to the SM predictions, such that overall the fit result becomes worse with increasing values of BRinv. As a result, even though for all possible values of BRinv one can find ranges of cu and cd that describe the experimental data regarding h125 as accurate as the SM, the size of the allowed regions of the coupling modifiers decreases and the fit result deteriorates with increasing value of BRinv.\nThe two examples discussed above demonstrate that the presence of sizable values of BRinv can improve or worsen the fit result to the Higgs-boson measurements, depending on which ranges of the coupling modifiers are considered, and depending on whether additional relations between the different modifiers are imposed. Since in both cases viable parameter ranges of the coupling modifiers survived even for values of BRinv 10%, it becomes apparent that both the direct and the indirect constraints on BRinv have to be considered in order to be in agreement with the measure-\nments regarding h125. In Sect. 3.4 we will analyze the impact of the values of BRinv on the allowed parameter regions in UV-complete models in which the couplings of the state at 125 GeV can be captured by the full set of coupling modifiers considered in our analysis, as defined in Eq. (2.3). Therein, as an illustrative example of popular BSM theories for which our results are relevant, we will focus on models containing, in addition to the hidden sector as the origin of the invisible decay mode of h125, a second Higgs doublet."

            "text": "In this section we will apply the indirect constraints on BRinv obtained previously to concrete BSM scenarios featuring a hidden sector. We will start by considering Higgs-portal darkmatter models in Sect. 3.1 in which no coupling modifications of h125 are present, i.e. ci = 1. As demonstrated in Sect. 2.1, in this case the indirect constraints on BRinv are stronger than the direct constraints, such that the latter do not have to be considered. Afterwards we will discuss in Sects. 3.2\u2013 3.4 models featuring a hidden sector and an extended Higgs sector, in which the couplings of h125 to ordinary matter deviate from the SM predictions. Following the discussions in Sects. 2.2 and 2.3, here depending on the values of the coupling modifiers ci predicted in each model, both the indirect or the direct constraints on BRinv can be stronger, such\nthat both constraints will have to be considered and their complementarity can be studied.\n3.1 The Higgs portal dark matter model\nOne of the simplest approaches to accommodate a valid DM candidate in a BSM scenario consists of the so-called Higgs portal scenario. Here it is assumed that the discovered Higgs boson h125 is the only portal to the dark sector, such that no direct (gauge) interactions with the SM fermions and the gauge bosons exist. We will consider here three possible kind of DM candidates coupled to the Higgs boson viaL = LSM+ LDM where LSM is the SM Lagrangian and LDM = LS for real scalar DM (\u2261 S), LDM = L\u03c7 for Dirac fermion DM (\u2261 \u03c7 ) and LDM = LV for real vector DM (\u2261 V\u03bc) with\nLS = \u22121 4 \u03bbS|H |2S2, L\u03c7 = \u22121 4 \u03bb\u03c7 |H |2\u03c7\u0304\u03c7, LV = \u22121 4 \u03bbV |H |2V\u03bcV\u03bc, (3.1)\nwhere \u03bbS,\u03c7,V and are respectively dimensionless and dimension-one couplings. We parameterize the SM Higgs doublet in unitary gauge H = (0, v + h)T /\u221a2 with v 246 GeV and h = h125 is the SM Higgs boson. In addition, in each of the three cases we consider bare mass terms for our DM candidates. We will denote the physical scalar, fermion and vector dark-matter masses after electroweak symmetry breaking by mS,\u03c7,V , respectively. The partial widths of the Higgs-boson decays into a pair of DM particles are given by11\nh\u2192SS = \u03bb 2 Sv 2\n128\u03c0mh\n( 1 \u2212 4m 2 S\nm2h\n)1/2 ,\nh\u2192\u03c7\u0304\u03c7 = \u03bb2\u03c7v 2mh\n128\u03c0 2\n( 1 \u2212 4m 2 \u03c7\nm2h\n)3/2 ,\nh\u2192VV = \u03bb 2 V v 2m3h 512\u03c0m4V\n( 1\u22124m 2 V\nm2h +12m\n4 V m4h\n)( 1\u2212 4m 2 V\nm2h\n)1/2 .\n(3.2)\nHiggs-portal models are strongly constrained by the nullresults of direct-detection experiments. Currently, the most stringent experimental constraints on the DM-nucleon spinindependent scattering cross section \u03c3SI were reported by the Xenon1T [14], PandaX-4T [15] and the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiments [16], whose most recent results exclude \u03c3SI 10\u221247 cm2 for a 50 GeV DM mass and up to \u03c3SI 10\u221245 cm2 for 10 TeV DM mass. The sensitivity of the upcoming Darwin experiment [70] should improve the current bounds from LZ\n11 The expression for the scalar DM is in agreement with Refs. [20,68]. The expression for the vector DM is in agreement with Ref. [69].\nby more than an order of magnitude, and will almost reach the so-called neutrino floor [71]. The direct detection cross section with a nucleon N , mediated by the Higgs boson, can be expressed for the three scenarios considered here as\n\u03c3 SSI = \u03bb2S\u03bc 2 SNm 2 N\n16\u03c0m2Sm 4 h\nf 2N , \u03c3 \u03c7 SI =\n\u03bb2\u03c7\u03bc 2 \u03c7Nm 2 N 16\u03c0 2m4h f 2N ,\n\u03c3 VSI = \u03bb2V\u03bc 2 V Nm 2 N\n16\u03c0m2Vm 4 h\nf 2N , (3.3)\nwith \u03bcAB = mAmB/(mA + mB).12 The nucleon form factor fN \u223c 0.3 is defined as fN \u2261 f (N )Tu + f (N )Td + f (N )T s + (6/27) f (N )TG where f (N ) Tq \u2261 \u3008N |mqq\u0304q|N \u3009/mN is the contribution from a quark q to the nucleon mass and f (N )TG \u2261 1 \u2212 \u2211q f (N )Tq is the gluon contribution.13\nAfter implementing the models in Feynrules [73], we used micrOMEGAs [74,75] to compute numerically both relic abundance and direct detection cross sections.14 In Fig. 5 we represented with a dark gray line in the plane {\u03c3SI,mS,\u03c7,V } the parameter points that satisfy the relic density as determined by the Planck collaboration [12] within a 3\u03c3 interval around the best-fit value, \u03c7h2 \u2208 [0.11933 \u2212 3 \u00d7 0.00091, 0.11933 + 3 \u00d7 0.00091] for the three kind of dark matter candidates of the Higgs portal scenarios considered in this work. We also indicate the constraints from LZ in dashed blue, sensitivity prediction for Darwin in dotteddashed green and the neutrino floor in solid red. From Fig. 5, one can see that the Higgs portal models considered in this section are essentially only allowed for bosonic dark matter candidates and for a very narrow region of DM masses close to the resonance m\u03c7 mh/2 62.5 GeV, if one assumes that the dark matter abundance saturates the Planck best fit value. The fermionic dark matter candidate considered in this section is entirely excluded by the most recent results from the LZ collaboration.\nWe represented the relic density and direction detection constraints in the left panels of Fig. 6 in terms of a dimensionless coupling as a function of the DM mass. In addition, we represented constraints on Higgs physics from HiggsSignal and direct limits from ATLAS respectively in black and dotted-dashed orange line. For a given set of parameters, one can rescale the LZ constraints according to the predicted value for the relic abundance via \u03c3LZSI = \u03c3LZSI | DMh2 = 0.11933 ( 0.11933\nDMh2\n) , (3.4)\n12 The expression for scalar DM is in agreement with Refs. [20,23,68], and the one for vector DM is in agreement with Refs. [23,69] 13 Numerical values for these form factor can be found in Ref. [72]. 14 With micrOMEGAs, we obtained numerical results for the direct detection cross section within a 10% agreement with respect to our analytical expression of Eq. (3.3).\nwhere\u03c3LZSI | DMh2=0.11933 is the LZ constraint assuming a DM abundance DMh2 = 0.11933 and DMh2 is the DM abundance predicted for a given set of parameters. The rescaled LZ constraint is represented on the plots in the right panels of Fig. 6 where the blue areas represent the excluded regions. One can see from this figure that such constraint weaken precisely around the peak value for bosonic DM candidates, as a smaller DM abundance DMh2 < 0.11933 is generated in this region. However, the fermionic dark matter candidate is completely excluded, even if it constitutes just a fraction of the total dark matter.15\nOne can relax the condition of achieving the correct relic abundance via a single Higgs-portal parameter by assuming the presence of additional DM annihilation channels as typically expected in constructions featuring a more complex hidden sector. In this case, the correct relic abundance could be achieved for a smaller value of the Higgs-portal dimensionless coupling. As can be seen in the left panels of Fig. 6, constraints from Higgs physics would become the strongest, for fermion and vector DM, in the region of the parameter space corresponding to masses mh/2. In addition, if one assumes a multi-component dark matter setup, direct detection constraints would have to be rescaled according to the local density of the relevant dark matter component. The parameter space at small masses mh/2 could open up and the constraints derived in this work would become the strongest. In such cases, for DM masses typically mh/2, our constraints derived using HiggsSignal, independent of the local dark matter density, could be stronger than both direct detection bounds and from an extrapolation of direct searches for a invisible decay of the Higgs boson.\n3.2 Singlet portal dark matter\nThe simplest possibility to extend the Higgs portal DM scenario is to assume the presence of an additional real singlet scalar field that can act as a portal between the dark sector and the visible sector. This can be achieved by considering a discrete Z4 symmetry acting on \u2192 \u2212 [38] and by introducing components of a fermionic Dirac DM candidate \u03c7L ,R with opposite chiralities \u03c7 \u2261 \u03c7L + \u03c7R that couples to via\nL \u2283 \u2212y\u03c7 \u03c7\u0304L\u03c7R + h.c., (3.5)\n15 Notice that in this work we considered a scalar operator \u03c7\u0304\u03c7 connected to the Higgs field. Our statement here depends on the choice of operators and could differ, for example, for a pseudoscalar operator \u03c7\u0304\u03b35\u03c7 . It remains to be investigated whether one can evade the LZ constraints upon inclusion of the pseudoscalar operator, or whether the presence of new mediators between the hidden sector and the visible sector at or below the electroweak scale have to be introduced in order to predict a viable fermionic Higgs-portal DM scenario [76] (see also Sect. 3.2).\nwhere y\u03c7 is a Yukawa coupling.16 The most general scalar potential respecting the Z4 symmetry is given by\nV = \u03bc2H H\u2020H + 1\n2 \u03bc2\n2 + \u03bbH ( H\u2020H )2\n+ 1 4 \u03bb 4 + 1 2 \u03bb H 2H\u2020H, (3.6)\nwhere \u03bcH, and \u03bbH, , H are respectively dimension-one and dimensionless parameters. H is a SU (2) Higgs doublet, following the same notation as in the previous section. The quartic coupling \u03bb H in combination with the Yukawa interaction of Eq. (3.5) allow for the interactions between the DM candidate and the SM. The Z4 symmetry is spontaneously broken down to a remaining Z2 symmetry by the vacuum expectation value (vev) of the singlet field \u3008 \u3009 = v\u03c6 . We parametrize the scalar field as = v\u03c6 + \u03c6 where \u03c6 denotes a real scalar degree of freedom. The singlet vev v\u03c6 generates a mass termm\u03c7 = y\u03c7v\u03c6 for the DM fermion, whose stability is ensured by the remaining Z2 symmetry. In the following, we will assume that no bare mass term for the DM fermion is present (or equivalently that it can be neglected), such that the physical mass of \u03c7 is given by m\u03c7 . In order to obtain the physical mass eigenstates h1,2 an orthogonal field transformation can be performed, parameterized by an angle \u03b8 ( h1 h2 ) = ( c\u03b8 \u2212s\u03b8 s\u03b8 c\u03b8 ) ( h \u03c6 ) , (3.7)\nwith s\u03b8 \u2261 sin \u03b8 and c\u03b8 \u2261 cos \u03b8 . The expression for the mixing angle \u03b8 in terms of the vevs and the quartic scalar couplings and details about the minimization of the scalar potential are given in Appendix A. In the following, the physical state h1 h125 denotes the neutral scalar whose mass is identical to the discovered Higgs boson, i.e.mh1 125 GeV, but with couplings modified by factors of cuni = cos \u03b8 with respect to the SM prediction. In the following the mixing angle \u03b8 is taken as free parameter in combination with the physical masses mh1 and mh2 and the vev of the singlet v\u03c6 . Taking into account that the Yukawa coupling y\u03c7 is fixed by the DM mass m\u03c7 = y\u03c7v\u03c6 if v\u03c6 is used as free parameter, we are left with (mh1,mh2 ,m\u03c7 , v\u03c6, \u03b8) as set of independent free parameters.\nBoth physical scalars mediate DM-nucleon scatterings whose corresponding cross section can be expressed as\n\u03c3SI = \u03bc2\u03c7N\n\u03c0 [ mNm\u03c7 vv\u03c6 c\u03b8 s\u03b8 ( 1 m2h2 \u2212 1 m2h1 )]2 f 2N . (3.8)\nwhere notations are identical to the ones used in Sect. 3.1. In Fig. 7 we represented the value of the direct detection cross section as a function of the dark matter mass for the parameter space allowing to reproduce the correct relic abundance for\n16 Under the Z4 symmetry, the two chirality components of \u03c7 would transform as \u03c7R \u2192 i\u03c7R and \u03c7L \u2192 \u2212i\u03c7L .\nselected value of v\u03c6 and mh2 as dark-grey lines. 17 In Fig. 7 the resonances correspond to DM annihilating via (quasi) onshell mediators (h1 and h2) and therefore are peaked around m\u03c7 mh1/2 62.5 GeV and m\u03c7 mh2/2. The vertical lines at m\u03c7 30 GeV in the left plot and m\u03c7 80 GeV in the middle plot, respectively, have their origin in the channel \u03c7\u0304\u03c7 \u2192 h2h2 opening, which is kinematically forbidden at zero temperature for m\u03c7 < mh2 and exponentially suppressed at finite temperature but yet still efficient enough to yield the correct relic abundance. For this annihilation channel the DM abundance is set by the value of the Yukawa coupling between the fermionic DM and the singlet scalar, which also sets the DM mass resulting in \u03b8 -independent generated relic abundance. Larger DM masses correspond to larger annihilation cross sections and a resulting dark matter under-abundance.\nWe also indicate in Fig. 7 the currently strongest upper limit on \u03c3SI from the LZ collaboration with the blue shaded region. One can see that the LZ constraints exclude most parts of the parameter space that predicts the experimentally determined DM relic abundance. In the scenario with mh2 < mh1/2 (left plot) and mh1/2 < mh2 < mh1 (middle plot) only DM masses of m\u03c7 mh2/2 and m\u03c7 mh2 remain viable, whereas the scenario with mh2 > mh1 (right plot) is entirely ruled out in the low-mass regime investigated here. Thus, we will not discuss the latter scenario any further in the following.\nIn the singlet portal dark matter model the presence of a second scalar particle gives rise to additional experimental constraints that have to be applied. The Higgs boson h1 h125 can decay invisibly into a dark matter pair, but h1 can also decay into pairs of light scalars h2 if mh2 < mh1/2. Depending on whether the singlet-like state h2 decays predominantly into SM particles or into DM pairs,\n17 The DM-nucleon scattering cross sections obtained with the analytical expression shown in Eq. (3.8) are in agreement within 10% with the results obtained using the public code micrOMEGAs [74,75].\nthe decay mode h1 \u2192 h2h2 either gives rise to exotic visible decay modes of h1, mainly resulting in bb\u0304bb\u0304, bb\u0304\u03c4+\u03c4\u2212 and bb\u0304\u03bc+\u03bc\u2212 final states, or the decay mode h1 \u2192 h2h2 gives rise to an additional invisible decay mode of h1. The decay rates for the decays of h1 into BSM states are given in Appendix A.2. Accordingly, the additional Higgs boson h2 can be searched for via the decays h1 \u2192 h2h2 if kinematically allowed in the final states mentioned above. In addition, h2 can be directly searched for at pp colliders via its production in the ggH or VBF production modes and at lepton colliders via Higgsstrahlung production. Therefore, we here also include constraints from collider searches for additional Higgs bosons by using the public code HiggsBounds [47,77\u201380], which are complementary to the constrains resulting from the signal-rate measurements of h1.\nWe present in Fig. 8 the constraints from the Higgs-boson measurements using HiggsSignal and from searches for additional Higgs bosons using HiggsBounds. The toppanels show \u03c72 obtained with HiggsSignal, and the corresponding upper bounds on the mixing angle as a function of the dark matter mass for selected value of v\u03c6 and mh2 at the 68% and the 95% CL indicated by the black dashed and solid lines, respectively. We also indicate the region which is excluded by the observed 95% CL cross-section limits with regards to h2 with the red line, where the regions above the red lines are excluded (further details are given below). Finally, the orange dotted-dashed lines indicate the regions at which the predicted invisible branching ratio of the discovered Higgs boson at 125 GeV are equal to the upper limit obtained from direct searches for the invisible decay mode, i.e. BRinv = 11%. As mentioned above, here BRinv is determined by adding the contributions from the decay modes h1 \u2192 \u03c7\u0304\u03c7 and h1 \u2192 h2h2 \u2192 \u03c7\u0304\u03c7\u03c7\u0304\u03c7 if kinematically allowed. One can see that in both scenarios the indirect constraints on BRinv from the cross-section measurements of h125 (black lines) are stronger than the direct limit on BRinv for all DM masses considered.\nThe lower panels show the same exclusion lines superimposed to the parameter space allowed by the LZ bounds, and in which the correct relic abundance (dark grey) or a lower value (light grey) is achieved. As discussed in Sect. 3.1, the LZ constraints are rescaled according to Eq. (3.4). According to the previous discussion, the parameter space allowed by the LZ constraints corresponds to two different regimes: a narrow region aroundm\u03c7 mh2/2 where DM annihilation is resonantly enhanced by s\u2212channel diagrams and the region m\u03c7 mh2 where \u03c7\u0304\u03c7 \u2192 h2h2 DM annihilation processes are efficient enough in order to not overclose the universe. In the following, we discuss in more detail the two benchmark scenarios with mh2 < mh1/2 (left) and mh1/2 < mh2 < mh1 (right) that are depicted in Fig. 8.\nA secondHiggs boson below 125/2 GeV: In the scenario depicted in the left panels of Fig. 8, the decay of the SM-like Higgs boson h1 into a pair of scalars h2 is kinematically allowed, which mainly determines the exclusions obtained from the experimental data regarding h1 h125. For DM masses of 2m\u03c7 > mh2 = 30 GeV, the scalar h2 decays to visible final state (mostly b\u0304b). If 2m\u03c7 > mh1 125 GeV the HiggsSignals constraint (\u03b8 < 0.073 at 95% CL) is then insensitive to the DM mass. For m\u03c7 mh2/2, the invisible decay channel h2 \u2192 \u03c7\u0304\u03c7 becomes relevant, such that BRinv > 0 and one finds slightly stronger constraints on\n\u03b8 from the cross-section measurements of h125 h1. One can compare the indirect constraints from the cross-section measurements of h125, indicated by the black line, to the exclusions from the direct constraint BRinv < 11% obtained from searches for the invisible decay of h125, indicated by the orange line. The direct limit on BRinv gives rise to two disconnected exclusion regions. The parameter space above the right parabola-shaped orange line is excluded because the decay mode h1 \u2192 \u03c7\u03c7\u0304 has a branching ratio larger than 11%. The second exclusion region is the parameter space that lies within the closed orange line at m\u03c7 < 15 GeV, in which additionally the decay mode h1 \u2192 h2h2 \u2192 \u03c7\u03c7\u0304\u03c7\u03c7\u0304 contributes to BRinv. However, both exclusion regions resulting from the direct limit on BRinv lie above the black line and are therefore already excluded based on the signal-rate measurements of h125. Finally, the exclusions as a consequence of the searches for additional Higgs bosons, indicated by the red line, have their origin in two different collider searches. For m\u03c7 > 15 GeV we find an upper limit of \u03b8 0.15 due to constraints from searches for Higgs-boson decays into a pair of two lighter scalars in the bb\u0304\u03bc+\u03bc\u2212 final state performed by the ATLAS collaboration at 13 TeV [81]. For m\u03c7 < 15 GeV we find a substantially stronger limit of \u03b8 0.10 from searches for invisibly decaying scalars performed by the OPAL collaboration at the LEP collider at up to 209 GeV\n[82]. However, for all values ofm\u03c7 considered the constraints from the searches for additional Higgs bosons are weaker than the constraints determined with HiggsSignals.\nA second Higgs boson below 125 GeV: Whereas in the previous case the indirect constraints from the h125 measurements were dominantly determined by the presence of the decay mode h2 \u2192 h1h1, in the benchmark scenario depicted in the right plot of Fig. 8 this decay is kinematically not possible. Thus, the constraints depend, on the one hand, on the presence of the mixing between h1 and h2, and, on the other hand, also on the presence of the invisible decay h1 \u2192 \u03c7\u03c7\u0304 if 2m\u03c7 < 125 GeV. We find that the HiggsSignal constraints (black line) are weaker at large DM masses m\u03c7 > mh1/2, yielding an upper limit of \u03b8 < 0.29. This limit is only set by modifications of the SM prediction of the Higgs-boson universal couplings and matches our results from Sect. 2.2 of Eq. (2.9). The invisible decay of the SM-like Higgs boson opens up form\u03c7 < mh1/2, and the exclusion line from the HiggsSignals analysis drops below the one from HiggsBounds (red line) at DM masses below about 60 GeV. With regards to the direct limit on BRinv (orange line), the island of an excluded region at m\u03c7 < 15 GeV disappears in the right plot, since only the invisible decay h1 \u2192 \u03c7\u0304\u03c7 is kinematically allowed, whereas the decay h1 \u2192 h2h2 is not possible, leaving only the parabolic-shaped upper bound set by the invisible decay of the Higgs boson h125. As before, the indirect constraints from the cross-section measurements of h125 are always stronger than the constraints from the direct limit on BRinv. In contrast to the previous case, we find for mh2 > mh1/2 that the HiggsBounds analysis excluded parameter regions that otherwise would be allowed. In the right plot, with mh2 = 80 GeV, we find an upper limit of \u03b8 0.225 as a result of the cross section limits from searches for scalar particles produced via Higgsstrahlung production and decaying into pairs of bottom quarks performed at LEP [83].18 The exclusion power of this search becomes much weaker for m\u03c7 < 40 GeV, where the scalar h2 is able to decay into pairs of \u03c7 and the branching ratio for the decay h2 \u2192 bb\u0304 is smaller.\nIn this section we have considered a discreteZ4 symmetry as a specific example. However this construction could be extended by considering instead a global continuous U (1) symmetry, broken spontaneously. In this case the imaginary part of the complex scalar field responsible for the symmetry breaking would be a massless Goldstone boson. The analysis performed in this section would not be drastically affected by\n18 In addition, the HiggsBounds analysis provides constraints that are stronger than the ones from HiggsSignals at m\u03c7 3 GeV, where however the dark-matter direct-detection constraints already rule out the relevant part of the parameter space. The most sensitive search as determined by HiggsBounds here is the search for invisibly decaying scalars at LEP performed by the L3 collaboration [84].\nthe presence of this new state but would need to be accounted for in the possible DM annihilation final states. Constraints from Higgs physics would have to be modified as the SMlike Higgs boson could decay into a pair of Goldstone bosons. This precise point is discussed in the following subsection.\n3.3 (Pseudo) Nambu\u2013Goldstone bosons\nIn this section we consider a model with an additional (approximate) global U (1) symmetry and a complex scalar field parameterized in the exponential form by = (v\u03c6 + \u03c6)eia/v\u03c6 / \u221a 2, singlet under the SM gauge group but charged\nunder the new global U (1). All SM fields are singlets under the additional U (1) symmetry. The scalar potential including all terms that respect this symmetry has the same form as the one of Eq. (3.6), and we adopt the same notation as in Sect. 3.2. Depending on the specificity of the model, the global symmetry could be spontaneously broken (v\u03c6 = 0) or not (v\u03c6 = 0). If the symmetry is spontaneously broken, a mixing by an angle \u03b8 between the real part of the complex field and the Higgs field is generated, while the state a is a Nambu\u2013Goldstone Boson (NGB) or Pseudo Nambu\u2013 Goldstone Boson (PNGB) depending on whether the broken symmetry was exact or approximate before spontaneous symmetry breaking. In the latter case, we assume that any explicit symmetry breaking term is small compared to the electroweak scale such that the mass of the (P)NGB can be set to zero in the following analysis. Using the exponential parametrization, the field a disappears from the scalar potential and the only coupling between the Higgs boson at 125 GeV and the (P)NGB is generated via mixing from the kinetic terms of the scalar after spontaneous symmetry breaking [85,86],\nL \u2283 |\u2202\u03bc |2 = 1 2\n( \u2202\u03bc\u03c6\u2202 \u03bc\u03c6 + \u2202\u03bca\u2202\u03bca ( \u03c62\nv2\u03c6 + 2 \u03c6 v\u03c6 + 1\n)) ,\n(3.9)\nbefore performing a rotation to the mass eigenstate basis. We obtain canonically normalized kinetic terms for the massless pseudoscalar field a in addition to higher dimensional operators involving derivative couplings. One can perform a rotation to the physical CP-even neutral scalar mass eigenstate basis {h1, h2} by considering the transformation described in the previous section (see Eq. (3.7)). By selecting only terms relevant for the decay of the SM-like Higgs boson into pairs of (P)NGBs, one obtains\nL \u2283 1 2 \u2202\u03bca\u2202\n\u03bca (\n1 \u2212 2 s\u03b8h1 v\u03c6\n) \u2283 \u2212\u2202\u03bca\u2202\u03bca s\u03b8h1\nv\u03c6 . (3.10)\nThis parametrization makes obvious that the decay into pairs of (P)NGBs of the SM-like Higgs state is triggered by the mixing angle \u03b8 . The coupling term of Eq. (3.10) generates a\npartial decay width\nh1\u2192aa = s2\u03b8\n32\u03c0 m3h1 v2\u03c6 . (3.11)\nOne can recover this result by choosing the linear parametrization = (v\u03c6 + \u03c6 + ia)/ \u221a 2 and by expressing the scalar potential of Eq. (3.6) in terms of the mass eigenstates, as performed in Ref. [64].\nAs the couplings between the SM field content and the Higgs boson h1 h125 are modified by a universal factor cuni = cos \u03b8 , we can derive constraints in the plane {cos \u03b8, (v\u03c6/mh1)}, where we divide the vev v\u03c6 by mh1 = 125 GeV in order to have a dimensionless quantity. We depict in Fig. 9 with the color coding the \u03c72-values from HiggsSignals in this plane. In addition, we show with the black dashed and solid lines the resulting exclusion limits at the 68% and 95% CL, respectively, and we also show exclusion lines based on perturbative unitarity constraints on the dimensionless coupling of the scalar potential for a selection of masses mh2 = v\u03c6/2, v\u03c6, 2v\u03c6 (explicit expressions for these constraints can be found, for instance, in Ref. [87]).19 In agreement with the discussions of Sect. 2.2, we find that the indirect constraints from the cross-section measurements of h125 are considerably stronger than constraints from the experimental limit on BRinv from direct\n19 The mh2 dependence of these limits enters via the relations shown in Eqs. (A.5)\u2013(A.6).\nsearches for the invisible decay of h125, where the latter are indicated with the orange dashed-dotted line in Fig. 9. For instance, for v\u03c6/mh1 = 10 we find that the mixing angle is constrained to be cos \u03b8 > 0.99 or equivalently \u03b8 < 0.14 at 95% CL based on the values of \u03c72, whereas the bounds from direct searches for the decay h125 \u2192 inv allow for values as small as cos \u03b8 > 0.98 or equivalently \u03b8 < 0.20. As can be seen in Eq. (3.11), in the limit where the ratio v\u03c6/mh1 becomes large, the partial width for the invisible decay of h1 h125 becomes negligible. Accordingly, in this limit the bound on the mixing angle saturates at a constant value of cos \u03b8 > 0.959 which matches our results derived in Sect. 2.2 of Eq. (2.8) in the limit BRinv \u2192 0. The limits on cos \u03b8 can be even stronger when one combines the limits from the crosssection measurements of h125 with the perturbative unitarity constraints. For instance, assuming that mh2 = v\u03c6 imposes cos \u03b8 > 0.966, corresponding to \u03b8 < 0.26.\nIt is tempting to demand independent limits on BRinv and \u03b8 in a phenomenological analysis in order to account in an approximate form for the experimental constraints, on the one hand, from the invisible decay mode of h125 and, on the other hand, from the mixing between h125 and the additional scalar state. In many studies this amounts to applying the direct limit on BRinv (orange line) and a constant lower limit on the coupling modifier cuni = cos \u03b8(> 0.959), where the value in the brackets is the limit we found to be valid in the limit BRinv \u2192 0 according to the discussion above. The results depicted in Fig. 9 illustrate that this approach would allow substantial parts of the parameter space that are actually excluded by the cross-section measurements of h125 (black line). This demonstrates that in order to fully exploit the experimental data with regards to the discovered Higgs boson in models with light hidden sectors it is vital to take into account simultaneously the presence of a non-zero BRinv and the modifications of the couplings of h125 to SM particles, as was done in our global \u03c72-analysis using HiggsSignals.\nThe results derived in this section go beyond the global symmetry case and can also be applied to the case of a local U (1) gauge symmetry to some extent. In the regime where the mass of the new light vector state mZ \u2032 = gZ \u2032q\u03c6v\u03c6 mh125 , with gZ \u2032 being the extra U (1) gauge coupling and q\u03c6 the charge of the complex scalar breaking this symmetry, by virtue of the Goldstone boson equivalence theorem the decay rate h125\u2192aa into a pair of Goldstone bosons a is identical to the rate h125\u2192Z \u2032Z \u2032 into a pair of massive gauge fields Z \u2032 in the small mass limit. Therefore, our constraints also apply to this case, provided that the produced Z \u2032 is sufficiently weakly coupled in order to escape the detector without interacting.\n3.4 Two Higgs doublet models\nOne of the most prominent example where observables related to the Higgs boson depart from their SM predicted val-\nues are models containing two Higgs doublet fields 1 and 2, called 2 Higgs doublet models (2HDM) [88,89] (see also Ref. [90] for a review). In the CP-conserving 2HDM, the physical Higgs spectrum consists of two CP-even states h and H , where h in the following plays the role of h125, a CP-odd state A, and a pair of charged Higgs bosons H\u00b1. In the decoupling limit of the 2HDM, in which the BSM particle states have masses considerably larger than the electroweak scale, the couplings of the state h = h125 to the fermions and gauge bosons are determined by only two parameters: the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the neutral CPeven components of the Higgs doublets v1 and v2 written in terms of the parameter\ntan \u03b2 \u2261 v2 v1\n, where v = \u221a\nv21 + v22 246 GeV, (3.12)\nand the rotation angle \u03b1 that determines the mixing of the two CP-even states h and H . In the so-called alignment limit, defined by the condition cos(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2) = 0, the couplings of h to the SM particles are identical to the predictions of the SM.\nIn order to eliminate sources of flavour-changing neutral currents at the classical level, one can introduce a softly broken Z2 symmetry, under which one of the Higgs doublets changes sign, whereas the second Higgs doublet transforms trivially, and the Z2 charges of the fermions depend on the so-called Yukawa type that is assumed. In total, there are four different possibilities to assign the fermion charges. Depending on the fermion charge, either 1 or 2 can be coupled to the corresponding fermion. In Table 3 we explicit which Higgs doublet field is coupled to which kind of fermion in each of the four types of the 2HDM considered in this work. The resulting structure of the coupling modifiers that is realized in each Yukawa type is given in Table 2. The explicit dependence of the modifiers cV,u,d, on the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2 can be found, for instance, in Ref. [90].\nIn the following we perform a \u03c72-scan in the plane {cos(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2), tan \u03b2} for the four types of the 2HDM in the decoupling limit, and we analyze how the allowed regions of parameter space are modified by the existence of an invisible decay mode of h. The resulting constraints in terms of exclusion regions can be applied to a variety of 2HDMs that are extended by a hidden sector. Such models comprise, for\ninstance, scalar gauge-singlet extensions of the 2HDM such as the N2HDM [91], the S2HDM [65,92] or the 2HDM+a [93]. Here it should be taken into account that for a concrete model realization of a particular configuration of 2HDM-like coupling modifications also other experimental and theoretical constraints would have to be considered. We refrain from doing such a model-specific analysis here, as we want to focus on the constraints that arise from the properties of h125 under the presence of an additional invisible decay mode.\nType I We show in the upper plots of Fig. 10 the \u03c72distribution in the {cos(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2), tan \u03b2} plane for the Yukawa type I for different values of BRinv (varied in steps of 2%). The black dashed and solid lines indicate the excluded regions of the model parameters at the 68% and the 95% CL, respectively. One can see that, as expected, the best agreement with the experimental data regarding h125 is found at or about the alignment limit cos(\u03b1 \u2212\u03b2) = 0, in which the state h resembles a SM Higgs boson. By comparing the plots for different values of BRinv it becomes apparent that the values of \u03c72 increase with increasing values of BRinv in the whole parameter plane. Consequently, in the Yukawa type I the presence of an invisible decay mode of h125 deteriorates the fit result to the experimental Higgs-boson data independently of the values of the coupling modifiers. For a value of BRinv = 6% only a small region with tan \u03b2 5 and cos(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2) 0 remains allowed at the 1\u03c3 level, whereas for BRinv = 8% even the alignment limit is almost excluded at the 95% CL. The type I Yukawa structure is excluded at more than 95% CL for BRinv = 10%, such that the experimental limits from direct searches for h125 \u2192 inv (currently at the level of BRinv < 11% or larger) do not provide additional constraints. The observations made here are in agreement with the results depicted in Fig. 3 for the scan in the benchmark model featuring the coupling modifiers cV and c f = cu = cd = c , which is also the pattern of coupling modifications that is realized in the type I, where here the additional restriction cV \u2264 1 applies. Accordingly, we also observe here values of \u03c72 substantially smaller than zero. The origin of these values was discussed already in Sect. 2.3.\nType II The corresponding results for the Yukawa type II are depicted in the bottom panels of Fig. 10. Regarding the fit result in the vicinity of the alignment limit of the Yukawa type II, one can observe that with increasing value of BRinv the parameter region that is in agreement with the measurements of h125 moves towards values of cos(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2) > 0. This is related to the fact that one finds |cb| < 1 and |cV | |cu | 1 for cos(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2) > 0, such that the additional contribution inv to the total decay width of h125 is compensated by a reduced partial decay width bb\u0304, while at the same time the ggH and the VBF production cross sections of h125 are not significantly modified compared to the SM predictions. On the other hand, for cos(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2) < 0 one finds |cd | > 1, such that the branching ratio of the decay\nh125 \u2192 \u03b3 \u03b3 is suppressed by both the non-zero value of inv and the enhancement of bb\u0304, and consequently the fit result deteriorates in this case with increasing values of BRinv.\nIn the type II, in addition to the alignment limit, there is a tight branch in the parameter plane with values of cos(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2) > 0.08 and tan \u03b2 7 that predicts a state h that can be in agreement with the experimental measurements and hence features small values of \u03c72. This branch is a 2HDM realization of the so-called wrong-sign Yukawa coupling regime, in which the absolute values of the coupling modifiers are approximately equal to one, i.e. |cV,u,d, | 1, but in which the couplings to down-type quarks have the opposite sign as compared to the couplings to gauge bosons and up-type quarks [42,94] (see also Ref. [95] for a discussion of this limit in the 2HDM in light of recent LHC measurements). In the absence of a decay mode h125 \u2192 inv the wrong-sign Yukawa coupling regime is in tension with the signal-rate measurements of h125, as can be seen in the upper left plot. This tension is mainly driven by the enhancement of the gluon-fusion production cross section of h125 compared to the SM prediction as a result of the modified interference effects between the contributions from the topquark loop and the bottom-quark loop [95]. We find here that the agreement with the experimental data can be improved significantly in the wrong-sign Yukawa coupling regime if a sizable value of BRinv is present. Even for values as large as BRinv = 10% we find parameter points in this limit that fit the signal-rate measurements of h125 just as well as the SM, whereas the same parameter points would be excluded at a CL substantially larger than 2\u03c3 for BRinv = 0. Here, the additional partial decay with inv leads to a suppression of the ordinary decay modes of h125 which compensates the enhancements of the gluon-fusion production cross sections. The relative sizes of the signal rates of h125 can then remain close to the SM predictions because the type II Yukawa structure allows for the individual modification of both cu and cd , such that one can find |cu | |cV | 1 and |cd | < 1 (compare also to Fig. 4 and the related discussion).\nAs a consequence of the fact that we find both in the vicinity of the alignment limit and in the wrong-sign Yukawa coupling regime parameter points that are in agreement with the indirect constraints from the signal-rate measurements of h125 even for values of BRinv = 10%, whereas the same parameter points would be excluded in the absence of the invisible decay mode, it becomes clear that in the Yukawa type II the upper limits on BRinv from the direct searches for h125 \u2192 inv are (and will be) relevant and have to be taken into account. Finally, we emphasize that in order to find a valid parameter point in the allowed parameter regions for BRinv > 0 in a concrete BSM theory also other constraints, for instance, from LHC searches for the BSM Higgs bosons H , A and H\u00b1 would have to be checked against. We will leave such a model-specific analysis for future investigations.\nType III The results for the type III (lepton-specific) Yukawa structure are depicted in the top panels of Fig. 11. The couplings of h125 to vector bosons and to up- and downtype quarks in type III are identical to the ones in type I. Thus, the predictions for the production cross sections of h125 are very similar to type I. Accordingly, we find for type III that the agreement with the indirect constraints becomes worse with increasing value of BRinv, similarly to what we observed for type I (see Fig. 10). This is also true for the wrongsign Yukawa coupling regime, which cannot be realized in type I, whereas, as can be seen in the top row of plots in Fig. 11, in type III the wrong-sign Yukawa coupling regime is still allowed with regards to the constraints from the signalrate measurements of h125. However, in contrast to what we observed in type II, in type III the fit-result in the wrongsign Yukawa coupling regime becomes worse with increasing value of BRinv, and it is effectively absent for values of BRinv > 6%. We find that for BRinv = 8% only a small region around the alignment limit remains allowed if exclusion limits at the 95% CL are applied. For BRinv = 10% the whole parameter plane is excluded in type III. Hence, in this case the upper limits on BRinv resulting from the direct searches for h125 \u2192 inv do not provide additional constraints, and one should instead apply the indirect constraints resulting from the signal-rate measurements of h125.\nType IV The results for the Yukawa type IV (flipped) are depicted in the bottom panels of Fig. 11. In this type, the coupling modifiers cV , cu and cd are identical to the ones of the Yukawa type II. As a result, the cross-section predictions are also (practically) identical, and also the main branching ratios of h125 remain effectively unchanged compared to type II, with the exception of the decays of h125 into pairs of charged leptons. Accordingly, we find that the allowed region in the {cos(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2), tan \u03b2} plane resemble the allowed regions that we found for type II (see Fig. 10). Both in the vicinity of the alignment limit, but also in the wrong-sign Yukawa coupling regime, we find allowed regions that accommodate the experimental data regarding h125 within the 1\u03c3 level. Hence, as in type II, the direct limit BRinv < 11% from the searches for the h125 \u2192 inv decay mode have to be taken into account in type IV, since they exclude parameter space points with larger values of BRinv that otherwise would be allowed."

            "text": "We explored the possibility of connecting a hidden sector to the discovered Higgs boson at 125 GeV. We parameterized deviations of the Higgs-boson couplings to SM states by introducing coupling modifiers ci for i = V, u, d, , and by introducing a possible invisible branching ratio BRinv as a free parameter. We performed \u03c72-analyses taking into account a large set of cross-section and signal-rate mea-\nsurements of the discovered Higgs boson by using the public code HiggsSignals, and we identified the ranges of the coupling modifiers that are allowed or excluded at 68% and 95% confidence level depending on the value of BRinv. We furthermore derived constraints on generic constructions of modifications of the properties of h125 compared to the SM, by making general assumptions about the structure of the couplings, in order for the corresponding constraints to be applicable to a large category of models. Finally, we derived constraints on the model parameters for a variety of more specific BSM constructions featuring hidden sectors such as Higgs-portal dark matter models, scenarios featuring Nambu\u2013Goldstone bosons and extended Higgs sector in the context of the 2HDM.\nThe first general conclusion of this paper is that currently in a wide class of models the LHC measurements of the signal rates of conventional visible signals of h125, in particular in the golden di-photon channel, impose indirect constraints on the invisible branching ratio of the discovered Higgs boson that can be substantially stronger than the direct constraints resulting from searches for the invisible Higgs-boson decay. Hence, for a phenomenological analysis of a model in which decays of h125 into hidden sectors are kinematically open it is crucial to not only consider the direct limits on BRinv, but to also take into account the indirect constraints on BRinv in order to not include parameter regions that are in disagreement with the experimental data from the LHC.\nSecondly, we also found that the presence of a sizable value of BRinv can render scenarios beyond the SM that predict modifications to the couplings of h125 compared to the SM viable which would otherwise be excluded by the Higgsboson signal-rate measurements. This is trivially true in case of a universal enhancement of all Higgs-boson couplings by a common factor, where the enhancements of the couplings cancel the suppression of ordinary decay modes of h125 as a result of the additional decay mode h125 \u2192 inv. However, also more intricate coupling modifications can be rendered viable via the presence of an invisible decay mode of h125. The most striking example of our analysis is the wrong-sign Yukawa coupling regime realized in two Higgs doublet extensions of the SM with Yukawa type II and IV, which we showed to be in tension with the cross-section measurements of h125 assuming BRinv = 0, whereas it is in very good agreement with these measurements assuming values of BRinv as large as 10%.\nFor the variety of structures of coupling-modifiers and BSM model considered in this work, our main results are summarized in the following.\nSM-like couplings ci = 1 and BRinv = 0. If the Higgs boson possesses couplings to ordinary matter as predicted by the SM, we found that the invisible Higgs-boson branching ratio is constrained to be BRinv < 6.2% at 95% CL as a result of the indirect constraints from h125 signal-rate\nmeasurements, which is substantially smaller than the currently strongest limit BRinv < 11% resulting from the direct searches for the invisible decay of h125.\nUniversal couplings ci = cuni and BRinv = 0. We found a flat direction with \u03c72 = 0 in the {cuni, BRinv} plane where the universal enhancements of the Higgs-boson couplings for cuni > 1 are compensated by a non-vanishing BRinv. Based on the indirect constraints, universal couplings are allowed at 95% CL in the interval 0.520 BRinv + 0.960 < cuni < 0.565 BRinv + 1.043, and are ultimately only bound by the direct limit on BRinv. In the case where the origin of the coupling modification is the mixing of an additional gaugesinglet scalar with the Higgs boson h125, i.e. cuni = cos \u03b8 with \u03b8 being the mixing angle, we provided indirect limits on BRinv as a function of \u03b8 in an approximate form as given in Eq. (2.9).\nNon-universal couplings and BRinv = 0. We considered two examples for non-universal coupling modifications of the discovered Higgs boson. The first example consists in a common coupling modifier for the couplings to fermions, i.e. c f = cu = cd = c , and a second independent coupling modifier cV for the couplings to the gauge bosons. We found that if cV \u2264 1 applies, invisibleh125 decay modes gives rise to a decrease of the allowed ranges of both cV and c f . However, if also cV > 1 is considered, the \u03c72 values do not generically degrade as BRinv is increased to 10%. Hence, the presence of an invisible decay mode of h125 with sizable branching ratios opens up parameter space regions in the {c f , cV } plane that would be excluded if such a novel decay mode is not present. The second example considered is a SM-like Higgs-boson coupling to vector bosons cV = 1 but modified couplings to up and down-type quarks with the additional condition c = cd . We found that increasing values of BRinv shifts the allowed parameter space to larger values of cu and smaller values of cd = c , but overall yielding a degraded fit result.\nHiggs portal dark matter. We considered dark matter candidates (scalar, fermion and vector) coupled to the Higgs boson via a single operator and computed the relic abundance and direct detection cross section in terms of the dimensionless Higgs-portal coupling parameter for each case. Direct detection experiments tightly constrain the parameter space suitable to achieve the measured relic abundance, leaving for the bosonic candidates only the mass region at the Higgsboson resonance, i.e. if the DM mass is O(mh125/2). We showed that new results from the LZ collaboration rule out the fermionic DM candidate within the simplest Higgs-portal scenario under standard assumptions.20 Around the resonance, if we relax the hypothesis of the DM candidates to\n20 Given the fact that the LZ limit is close to the parameter space corresponding to the correct relic abundance, several uncertainties can affect this statement. To derive bounds on the DM nucleon scattering cross section, a local DM density of \u03c1 = 0.3 GeV cm\u22123 and the standard halo model for the distribution of dark matter in the Milky Way are\naccount for all the dark matter, the indirect constraints resulting from the cross-section measurements of h125 derived usingHiggsSignal are the strongest bounds in the narrow range of DM masses that is not excluded by direct detection experiments.\nSinglet portal dark matter. We studied an extension of the Higgs-portal scenario comprising an additional singletlike scalar h2 acting as the portal between a dark matter fermion and the visible sector. As a consequence of the presence of h2, we also took into account constraints from collider searches for additional Higgs bosons using the public code HiggsBounds. Firstly, we investigated a benchmark scenario in which both the decays of h125 into the dark-matter state and into a pair of the additional scalar are kinematically allowed, which both can contribute to BRinv depending on whether h2 decays invisibly. Secondly, we investigated a benchmark scenario in which the second scalar has a mass of 80 GeV, allowing for a larger mixing between discovered Higgs boson and h2. We identified the regions of the parameter space that are still allowed by direct detection constraints and in which part or all of the measured relic abundance of dark matter is predicted. We demonstrated that in such regions of the parameter space the indirect constraints from the cross-section measurements of h125 provide the strongest constraints, whereas the direct limit on BRinv from searches for the invisible decay of h125 do not give rise to any additional constraints.\n(Pseudo)Nambu\u2013Goldstonebosons ((P)NGB).We considered the possibility of the Higgs boson h125 decaying into pairs of (P)NGBs, where the (P)NGB arises as the angular mode of a new complex scalar after the spontaneous breaking of an additional (approximate) continuous symmetry once the radial mode acquires a vev v\u03c6 . Using the cross-section measurements of h125, we determined constraints on the mixing between h125 and the radial mode and on the invisible branching ratio BRinv. We highlighted that if one would apply independent constraints on the mixing angle \u03b8 and the invisible branching ratio BRinv, one would consider parameter regions as allowed which are actually excluded by the crosssection measurements of h125, as we showed by simultaneously taking into account both the mixing in the Higgs sector and the presence of a non-vanishing BRinv in a global fit to the experimental Higgs-physics observables.\nTwo Higgs doublet models. We derived constraints in the plane {tan \u03b2, cos(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2)} for tan \u03b2 \u2208 [0, 20] in the four Yukawa types of the 2HDM. We found that the \u03c72-fit result deteriorates in the type I and III as BRinv is increased, leaving\nFootnote 20 continued standard assumptions from direct detection collaborations. Both quantities suffer from astrophysical uncertainties that could affect constraints from direct searches by a O(1\u22123) factor [96]. Such uncertainties could allow the parameter space around the resonance to still be viable but on the edge of being excluded.\nboth types as excluded at the 95% CL for values of BRinv > 8%. On the other hand, for type II and IV a narrow region with small but positive values of cos(\u03b1 \u2212 \u03b2) remains viable even for BRinv = 10%. We also found that in these two types the wrong-sign Yukawa coupling regime, which is barely in agreement with the measurements of h125 for BRinv = 0, can be in very good agreement with the experimental data if the presence of an invisible decay mode of h125 with BRinv > 2% is assumed to be present.\nAcknowledgements The authors thank Anton Sokolov for useful discussions.

(A.1)\nUsing these relations, the mass matrix of the CP-even fields h and \u03c6 can be written as\nM2 = (\n2\u03bbHv2 \u03bb Hvv\u03c6 \u03bb Hvv\u03c6 2\u03bb v2\u03c6\n) .
