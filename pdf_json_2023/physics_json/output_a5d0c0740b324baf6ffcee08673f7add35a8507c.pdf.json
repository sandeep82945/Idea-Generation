To reduce clinical toxicity of colistin and improve targeting to infected /inflamed tissues, we previously developed dextrincolistin conjugates, whereby colistin is designed to be released by amylase-triggered degradation of dextrin in infected and inflamed tissues, after passive targeting by the enhanced permeability and retention effect. Whilst it was evident in vitro that polymer conjugation can reduce toxicity and prolong plasma half-life, without significant reduction in antimicrobial activity of colistin, it was unclear how dextrin conjugation would alter cellular uptake and localisation of colistin in renal tubular cells in vivo. We discovered that dextrin conjugation effectively reduced colistin\u2019s toxicity towards human kidney proximal tubular epithelial cells (HK-2) in vitro, which was mirrored by significantly less cellular uptake of Oregon Green (OG)-labelled dextrin-colistin conjugate, when compared to colistin. Using live-cell confocal imaging, we revealed localisation of both, free and dextrin-bound colistin in endolysosome compartments of HK-2 and NRK-52E cells. Using a murine AKI model, we demonstrated dextrin-colistin conjugation dramatically diminishes both proximal tubular injury and renal accumulation of colistin. These findings reveal new insight into the mechanism by which dextrin conjugation can overcome colistin\u2019s renal toxicity and show the potential of polymer conjugation to improve the side effect profile of nephrotoxic drugs.\nVarache et al.\nRunning title: Dextrin conjugation inhibits colistin\u2019s toxicity\n3"

            "text": "Polymyxins are highly effective antibiotics in the treatment of multi-drug resistant (MDR) infections caused by gram-negative bacteria. The reported incidence of nephrotoxicity in patients receiving these drugs (26.7% for colistin and 29.8% for polymyxin B, according to a recent meta-analysis)1 has led researchers to develop alternative dosing strategies and delivery systems to reduce this toxicity without compromising antimicrobial activity.\nUntil recently, the exact mechanism of polymyxin nephrotoxicity and its distribution in\nthe kidneys was poorly understood. Recent research by Yun et al. has demonstrated that polymyxin B distributes primarily to the proximal tubular cells of the renal cortex,2 due to extensive reabsorption and accumulation, where it accumulates at concentrations of up to 4,760-fold higher than the extracellular compartment.3 Internalisation of colistin at the luminal side of renal proximal tubule cells is driven by endocytosis (principally via the megalin receptor)4 and, due to its polycationic nature, facilitative transport (via the human peptide transporter 2 (PEPT2) and carnitine/organic cation transporter 2 (OCTN2)).5, 6 Following internalisation, colistin induces dysfunction of the mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum (ER), inducing concentration- and time-dependent cellular apoptosis by activation of the death receptor, mitochondrial and ER pathways.7 Histopathological damage, characterised by tubular dilation, epithelial cell vacuolisation and necrosis (in the absence of inflammatory response or interstitial fibrosis)2, 3, 7, 8 is also observed. More recently, a direct interaction between colistin and the phospholipid bilayer of renal tubular cells has been proposed to contribute to polymyxin-induced nephrotoxicity.9 Even intravenous (IV) administration of the pro-drug, colistimethate sodium (CMS), has been observed to induce cumulative dose- and duration-dependent increases in serum creatinine (a marker of kidney damage).10, 11\nWe previously described the potential use of dextrin-colistin conjugation, designed to\nimprove targeting to sites of infection by amylase-triggered degradation of the polymeric carrier (using polymer-masked unmasked protein therapy (PUMPT), as an attempt to reduce the observed nephrotoxicity.12-15 These studies demonstrated that dextrin-colistin conjugates\nVarache et al.\nRunning title: Dextrin conjugation inhibits colistin\u2019s toxicity\n5\nhad comparable antibacterial activity to Colomycin\u00ae, but with reduced in vitro toxicity and prolonged plasma half-life in rats (after a single dose). Hypothesising that dextrin conjugation would also potentially reduce renal endocytosis, accumulation and ultimately, nephrotoxicity, we investigated the in vitro and in vivo nephrotoxicity of dextrin-colistin conjugates. The internalisation and cellular localisation of Oregon Green (OG) 488-labelled conjugates was assessed in HK-2 and NRK-52E renal proximal tubule cells using flow cytometry and confocal microscopy, and in vitro cytotoxicity was assessed by measuring necrosis, metabolic activity and caspase activity. The dextrin-colistin conjugates were studied in a murine model of colistin-induced AKI to characterise the renal changes induced at the cellular and renal function level. Remarkably, we established that dextrin conjugation effectively prevents colistin-induced AKI, and demonstrated reduced cellular uptake of the antibiotic by proximal tubular cells. This work highlights, for the first time, the potential of polymer conjugation as a valuable tool to improve the side effect profile of nephrotoxic drugs."

After the final wash, trypsin-EDTA (200 \u03bcL) was added to each well and the cells harvested into falcon tubes. Each tube was topped up to 1 mL with PBS then centrifuged twice at 4\u00b0C (250 x g for 5 min).

Results were corrected for cell autofluorescence and expressed as (geometric mean \u00d7 % positive cells)/100, where positive cells are those cells falling within the region of positive staining (Figure 2a,b). Internalisation was calculated by subtracting the cell-associated fluorescence at 4\u00b0C (extracellular binding) from that at 37\u00b0C (intracellular uptake plus extracellular binding), and % internalisation was derived from the internalised OG-labelled probes compared to the total cell-associated fluorescence (at 37\u00b0C).

Sequential scans were performed to minimise bleed from one channel to another and sample photobleaching. Images were acquired with a raster size of 1,024 x 1,024 and a zoom of 2.5 to give an apparent voxel size of 130 x 130 x 500 nm (XYZ); here the pixel size is smaller than the resolution limit attainable by the microscope. At least, eight representative images (single section) were obtained from each sample; representative images for each condition are shown. Images were analysed and processed using ImageJ19 and the JACoP20 plugin for ImageJ, using Pearson\u2019s coefficient to determine co-localisation of OG-labelled probes with WGA-AF594. Thresholds for images were automatically determined using the Otsu thresholding algorithm, and the co-localisation value returned was used to calculate the mean co-localisation of 8 images.\nIn vivo acute kidney injury model To confirm an appropriate dose of colistin sulfate that could achieve significant acute kidney injury without general toxicity, phase 1 involved random division of mice into two groups (n = 4 animals per group), as follows: control (saline), colistin sulfate.

Here, dextrin-colistin conjugates were at least 3-fold less cytotoxic than colistin sulfate, with only a modest reduction in antimicrobial activity.15 A major benefit of dextrin conjugation over these alternative approaches is the ability to utilise the Enhanced Permeation and Retention (EPR) effect to specifically target inflamed and infected tissues,38 thereby increasing the local concentration of antibiotic in the infected tissue, while preventing uptake and accumulation in the kidneys. In a recent study, nanoparticle accumulation in wounds was 25-fold higher than in normal, and increased a further two-fold when wounds were infected.39\nIn vitro toxicity and intracellular localisation Although polymyxin-induced AKI is widely reported, its underlying molecular mechanism is not completely understood. Studies addressing the intracellular fate of colistin have previously shown that exposure causes mitochondrial dysfunction and ER stress.40-42 Yun et al2 also observed partial co-localisation of regioselectively labelled monodansylated polymyxin B probes (MIPS-9543 and MIPS-9544) within the mitochondria and ER of NRK52E cells. In our study, co-localisation of OG-labelled colistin or dextrin-colistin conjugates within the ER was not examined, however, we did not observe any co-localisation of probes within BODIPY TR ceramide- or MitoTracker-labelled compartments (Golgi and mitochondria, respectively) in HK-2 cells. In our studies, as observed by Jarzina et al43, human proximal kidney cells were significantly more sensitive to colistin sulfate than the rat cell line, NRK-52E. Interestingly, the authors also observed increased lysosomal disruption and significantly lower accumulation of colistin in rat cells, compared to human cells, which is consistent with the reduced internalisation and co-localisation of colistin to the\nVarache et al.\nRunning title: Dextrin conjugation inhibits colistin\u2019s toxicity\n17\nendolysosomes of NRK-52E cells, compared to HK-2 cells, observed in this study. They hypothesised that human proximal tubular cells may have increased expression of endocytic receptors for colistin and/or endocytic activity, compared to rat proximal tubular cells, though this has not yet been proven. Surprisingly, despite rat cells being less sensitive to colistin sulfate than human cells, dextrin-colistin conjugates behaved similarly in both cell lines. Analysis of the metabolic effects of dextrin and succinoylated dextrin revealed similar patterns of cytotoxicity in NRK-52E cells, but showed minimal toxicity in HK-2 cells (Figure S9), suggesting that the dextrin carrier may cause enhanced toxicity in rat cells. The correlation between intracellular polymyxin B concentration and toxicity has also been shown by Ahmed et al.44 They observed that polymyxin B caused more cell death and substantially more polymyxin B accumulation in HK-2, compared to A549 cells. The differences in colistin\u2019s cytotoxicity observed here and in other studies indicate speciesand/or cell type-specific differences in its activity. In our studies, caspase 3/7 activity after 24 or 72 h exposure generally reflected cell viability, rather than being indicative of a modified level of apoptosis activation; the induction of caspase-mediated apoptosis following colistin exposure has been observed in several previous studies.40, 42, 45, 46 Lee et al47 showed an early, dose-dependent increase in caspase 3/7 activity after incubation of HK-2 cells with colistin sulfate for 6 h, suggesting that the time points used in our studies may not have captured the changes.\nColistin-induced acute kidney injury In vivo pharmacokinetics and toxicity of colistin have been extensively studied in rodent models. The model employed here was adapted from a previous study and designed to study histopathological changes and alterations in AKI biomarkers, in the absence of significant toxicity to the animals.48 Based on previous studies,48-50 we initially administered 10 mg/kg/dose colistin sulfate intraperitoneally twice daily for 3 days. Whilst no difference in nephrotoxicity was seen between animals treated with colistin sulfate and saline, studies have shown that nephrotoxicity is associated with cumulative dose and treatment duration.11,\nVarache et al.\nRunning title: Dextrin conjugation inhibits colistin\u2019s toxicity\n18\n51, 52 Here, increasing the dose to 20 mg/kg/dose and extending the treatment duration to 7 days (cumulative dose to 280 mg/kg), resulted in significant increases in kidney injury biomarkers and histopathological damage.\nIn selecting biomarkers for evaluation of magnitude of AKI beyond functional\n(creatinine) and histological (semi-quantitative scoring) we were guided by the work of The Predictive Safety Testing Consortium.53 The ideal characteristics identified by this group are that a biomarker identifies kidney injury early, reflects the degree of toxicity, displays similar reliability across multiple species, localises the site of kidney injury, tracks progression of injury and recovery from damage, is well characterised with respect to limitations of its capacities, and is accessible in readily available body fluids or tissues. While no biomarker yet exactly matches this paradigm, the two most closely approximating and therefore most commonly employed current AKI biomarkers are KIM-1 and NGAL, and we therefore quantified both in this study. Here, we found that colistin sulfate caused a significant increase in both, KIM-1 and NGAL levels, without any significant effect on creatinine levels (as corroborated using a Crystal Chem Mouse creatinine assay kit, unpublished). Similarly, when Luo et al54 evaluated KIM-1 and NGAL as early indicators of gentamicin-induced nephrotoxicity in rats, the AKI biomarkers increased before serum creatinine levels changed. Serum creatinine is commonly used to estimate glomerular filtration rate, for the detection of nephrotoxicity, however, elevated levels tend to reflect advanced damage to the kidney and, thus, is not useful for early detection of colistin-induced AKI.41 In this study, none of the dextrin-colistin conjugates caused any effect on KIM-1 or NGAL levels, suggesting that dextrin conjugation can prevent colistin-induced AKI. The mechanism for the reduced toxicity is still unclear; live cell imaging showed localisation of both, colistin and dextrin-colistin conjugates in endolysosomes of HK-2 cells, and to a lesser extent in NRK-52E cells, while flow cytometry showed reduced uptake of dextrin-colistin conjugates by HK-2 and NRK-52E cells. Our previous studies have shown that, even after complete degradation of dextrin by amylase, colistin retains linker residues with differing lengths of glucose units attached, which modify antimicrobial activity.12 Thus, we hypothesise that these dextrin-based\nVarache et al.\nRunning title: Dextrin conjugation inhibits colistin\u2019s toxicity\n19\nstructural changes alter the internalisation and accumulation of colistin at the luminal side of renal proximal tubule cells, possibly by reducing binding to megalin receptors, thereby lowering the colistin concentration inside these cells. Indeed, analysis of the colistin content in the kidneys showed significantly reduced levels in mice treated with dextrin-colistin conjugates, compared with colistin sulfate controls.\nAlthough the transport of dextrin-colistin conjugates across the peritoneal membrane\ncould, theoretically, be limited, due to their relatively large size (>30 kDa) our previous work clearly demonstrates the rapid degradation of dextrin and reduction of molecular mass by physiological concentrations of amylase and the rapid amylase-triggered release of colistin from dextrin-colistin conjugates (and diffusion across dialysis membranes) in both, physicochemical and functional/ antimicrobial assays.14, 15 In support of this, increased bioavailability following IP administration of nanoformulated drugs, in comparison to the low molecular weight (parent) drug has been shown for PEG (20 kDa) IFN-beta-1a (being almost 100%)55 and also in BacE-PEG (24 kDa)-Alexa conjugates, which have wider distribution than the unPEGylated peptides.56 Moreover, experimental studies indicate that IP administered plasma proteins (e.g. albumin (66.5 kDa), transferrin (79.5 kDa) and immunoglobulin G (150kDa)) and are readily absorbed across the peritoneal membrane and distributed like IV-administered plasma proteins.57\nHere, mice treated with colistin sulfate showed signs of focal tubulointerstitial\ninflammation. A similar study in rats found no evidence of inflammation after twice daily treatment for 7 days,8 however they used colistimethate sodium, rather than colistin sulfate, which is a less toxic prodrug of colistin. Histological analysis of renal tissue from mice treated with DC7 showed signs of mild glomerulonephritis. We propose that this could be caused by accumulation of DC7 in these animals, resulting in cumulative osmotic effects. We have previously shown that the amylase-dependent degradation of DC7 is related to the degree of succinoylation, resulting in a prolonged plasma half-life of 21.2 h after a single intravenous dose.15 Thus, 12-hourly dosing would not allow complete clearance of DC7 between doses and would cause accumulation of the conjugate over the 7 days. In clinical\nVarache et al.\nRunning title: Dextrin conjugation inhibits colistin\u2019s toxicity\n20\npractice, polymer conjugates are typically administered with dosing intervals of several days and even commercial liposomal antibiotic formulations to treat bacterial and fungal infections are usually administered daily. The dosing schedule for individual dextrin-colistin conjugate formulations will require optimisation in future experiments, but it is likely that they will each require a different dosing interval to optimise the dose-response relationship."

Our findings shed new light on colistin\u2019s underlying molecular mechanism that warrants further investigation to optimise dextrin-colistin conjugates\u2019 design and dosing schedule. Extensive in vivo work is now needed, both to decipher the mechanism of reduced AKI by dextrin conjugation and ensure efficacy in an infection model."
