However, current immobilized enzyme carriers exhibit shortcomings such as uncontrollable pore size, high preparation costs, enzyme leaching, poor product stability, and reduced enzyme activity.13\u201315 However, metal\u2013organic frameworks (MOFs) have attracted greater attention due to their high specic surface area and pore volume, their designable and controllable structure, and their chemical and thermal stability.16\u201319\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

For this reason, hierarchical MOFs can not only protect the enzyme from external stimulation but also selectively transport the substrate and reaction products.28 These considerationsmotivated the present study's design of in situ and postsynthesis enzyme immobilization strategies.\nAccordingly, a microporous and hierarchical ZIF-8 (MZIF-8/ HZIF-8) was prepared for the study, with the HZIF-8 immobilized enzyme catalysts also developed via in situ and postsynthesis methods in the aqueous phase. These materials were then evaluated for their ability to remove 2,4-DCP. The removal efficiency of the LAC@HZIF-8 was predicted to exceed that of the LAC@MZIF-8 and LAC samples. In addition, the de novo-synthesized LAC@HZIF-8 sample (LAC@HZIF-8-D) was also expected to display greater stability than the MZIF-8 and post-synthesis (LAC@HZIF-8-P) samples. These investigations aimed to identify which enzyme immobilization strategy offers greater environmental stability and reuse ability, thereby improving the industrial application of laccase."

The HZIF-8 was prepared according to our previous work.29 In this procedure, Zn(NO3)2$6H2O (1 mmol) was rst dissolved in deionized water (25 mL), and appropriate amounts of L-histidine (His) and cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) with a 4 : 1 molar ratio were added and dispersed ultrasonically. 2-Methylimidazole (8 mmol) was then dissolved in deionized water (25 mL), and triethylamine (8 mmol) was added to the resulting solution. The two solutions were mixed and placed on a magnetic stirrer for 1 h at room temperature. The resulting product was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm, washed with a mixture of ethanol and water (1 : 1), and freeze-dried overnight to produce HZIF-8, a white powder.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nThe MZIF-8 was also prepared in line with previous research.30 First, Zn(NO3)2$6H2O (1 mmol) was dissolved in deionized water (25 mL). Subsequently, 2-methylimidazole (8 mmol) was dissolved in deionized water (25 mL), and triethylamine (8 mmol) was added to the solution. The Zn(NO3)2$6H2O and 2-methylimidazole solutions were then mixed and placed on a magnetic stirrer for 1 h at room temperature. Aer centrifugation and freeze-drying overnight, the white MZIF-8 powder was obtained.\n2.2.2 Synthesis of LAC@HZIF-8-D. The de novo synthesis of the LAC@ZIF-8-D MOF was performed as follows: rst, a certain quantity of laccase was dissolved in a pH 5 citric acid\u2013disodium phosphate (CPBS) buffer solution (1 mL). This was then added to a Zn(NO3)2$6H2O solution under ultrasonication, with the procedure then following that of the HZIF-8 preparation process described above.\n2.2.3 Synthesis of LAC@HZIF-8-P. The LAC@HZIF-8-P was prepared as follows: a certain amount of HZIF-8 was rst dissolved in 50 mL of deionized water and the laccase was then dissolved in 1 mL of a pH 5 citric acid\u2013disodium phosphate (CPBS) buffer solution and added to the HZIF-8 solution. This mixture was then stirred for 1 h, centrifuged, and freeze-dried overnight, producing the white LAC@HZIF-8-P powder. The products were stored in a refrigerator at 4 \u00b0C to prevent the immobilized enzyme from being inactivated.\n2.2.4 Synthesis of nCu/LAC@HZIF-8. The copper nanoparticles were synthesized according to previous research31 and loaded onto the LAC@ZIF-8 as follows. First, 25 mg of laccase was dissolved in 1 mL of citrate disodium hydrogen phosphate (CPBS) buffer solution (pH 5). Next, 25 mg of the copper nanoparticles was dispersed in 1 mL of deionized water. The laccase and copper nanoparticle solutions were then added to a solution containing Zn(NO3)2$6H2O, followed by ultrasonication. The synthesis then followed the procedure for the HZIF-8 immobilized enzyme described above to produce nCu/ LAC@HZIF-8. Aer freeze-drying, the product was ground and stored in a refrigerator at 4 \u00b0C.\n2.2.5 Laccase activity assay. The laccase activity assay followed the procedure described in Zhang et al.32 using 2,4-DCP as a substrate. The free laccase (1 mg) or LAC@ZIF-8 samples containing the same amounts of enzyme were then added to the citric acid\u2013disodium hydrogen phosphate (CPBS) buffer solution (pH 7) with ultrasonic dispersion. This solution was then added to the 2,4-DCP solution (20 mg L\u22121, 25 mL) and stirred to produce the reaction. Aer a certain reaction time, the absorbance of the solution was measured at 510 nm.

The dark areas in the TEM images (Fig. 1e and f) of the LAC@HZIF-8-D and LAC@HZIF-8-P samples differed from the HZIF-8 sample due to the agglomeration of the laccase blocked by the internal pores of the HZIF-8 synthesized in situ.

Fig. 1g depicts a sizeable uneven area of the uorescent green substances in the MZIF-8 immobilized enzyme material. Because the particle size of HZIF-8 pore size does not closely match the large-size laccase, the laccase loading can be attributed primarily to the HZIF-8 mesopores rather than its micropores. The highly dispersed uorescent signal depicted in Fig. 1h demonstrates the existence and uniform distribution of laccase across the entire HZIF-8 framework. The most dispersed signal was emitted from the LAC@HZIF-8-P, conrming it could hold the largest amount of the enzyme.\nThe Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FT-IR) analysis of the samples conrmed the formation of ZIF-8 and the loading of laccase. The laccase FTIR spectrum (Fig. 2a) indicates an absorption peak of 1645 cm\u22121 representing the N\u2013H and C\u2013N stretching bands of the amide group in the laccase.34 Moreover, the typical absorption peaks of the HZIF-8 at 3132, 2929, 1681, 1596, 1147, 995, and 424 cm\u22121 were retained in LAC@HZIF-8, indicating that the addition of laccase did not affect the synthesis of HZIF-8.35 Note that the interaction between histidine in the laccase and the histidine template in the HZIF-8 synthesis system caused the absorption peak of the LAC@HZIF-8 to deviate. At its 1645 cm\u22121 peak, the FT-IR spectrum of the LAC@HZIF-8-P revealed an obvious shoulder peak relative to HZIF-8 and MZIF-8, and a slight shi of the absorption peak at 1596 cm\u22121 to 1582 cm\u22121. In contrast, the\nFig. 2 (a) The FT-IR patterns of MZIF-8, HZIF-8, LAC@MZIF-8, LAC@ LAC@HZIF-8-D, LAC@HZIF-8-P, and nCu/LAC@HZIF-8 samples.\nFig. 3 (a) The XRD pattern of the ZIF-8 and LAC@ZIF-8 samples.

Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\n1645 cm\u22121 peak of the LAC@MZIF-8 exhibited a slight shoulder peak relative to the MZIF-8, possibly due to the latter's unstable structure and poor crystallinity, which produced a lower laccase loading rate in the LAC@MZIF-8 sample.36 The electrophoresis performed under enzyme denaturant conditions using sodium dodecyl sulfate\u2013polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS\u2013PAGE) was also tested to conrm the presence of laccase in HZIF-8 (Fig. S4\u2020). In general, both the LAC@HZIF-8-D and LAC@HZIF-8-P gels emitted a signal of 60 kDa, consistent with that emitted by the free laccase.\nThe weight lost from the samples was also measured. The weight of the laccase decreased rapidly below 300 \u00b0C while the MZIF-8 sample lost approximately 15% of its weight below 400 \u00b0 C (Fig. S2\u2020). However, as anticipated, the HZIF-8 synthesized using CTAB and histidine had a smaller weight loss ratio of about 9% in the same temperature range, which may be attributed to HZIF-8's higher specic surface area (Fig. 2b). The LAC@HZIF-8-P lost more weight than the HZIF-8 and LAC@HZIF-8 samples, which suggested its laccase loading rate was higher.37 Fig. 2b shows, moreover, that the TG curve trend exhibited by the nCu/LAC@HZIF-8-D was consistent with that of the HZIF-8 and LAC@HZIF-8-D, with no noticeable weight loss stage. At 300 \u00b0C, the LAC@HZIF-8-D and nCu/LAC@HZIF-8-D lost 8.36% and 11.1% of their weight, respectively, suggesting that the Cu NPs occupied and were loaded onto the mesoporous HZIF-8.\nHZIF-8-D, and LAC@HZIF-8-P.

The former two samples demonstrated six characteristic diffraction peaks at 7.3\u00b0, 10.5\u00b0, 12.7\u00b0, 14.7\u00b0, 16.5\u00b0, and 18.3\u00b0, consistent with the results of tests stimulating ZIF-8 (ref. 38 and 39) and conrming the expected structure of the LAC@ZIF-8 crystals.\nMoreover, the LAC@ZIF-8 patterns exhibited no impurity peak but produced a sharp peak indicating its high crystallinity and stable structure. Given that the catalyst activity performed more effectively with less space between the copper nanoparticles (Cu NPs) and laccase, we synthesized the nCu/ LAC@HZIF-8 based on the synthesis of LAC@HZIF-8-D. As Fig. S5\u2020 indicates, the loading of Cu nanoparticles affected neither the structure of the crystals nor the LAC@HZIF-8-D immobilization synthesis of HZIF-8. However, the XRD pattern suggests a attening of the Cu NPs' peak strength, indicating a more even distribution.40\nFig. 3b and c show the isothermal nitrogen adsorption and desorption curves for HZIF-8, LAC@HZIF-8-D, LAC@HZIF-8-P, and nCu/LAC@HZIF-8. All exhibit a type IV curve with slight uptake at a lower relative pressure (P/P0 < 0.8) and hysteresis loops at a high relative pressure (P/P0 > 0.9).41 The BET specic surface area of the LAC@HZIF-8-D-P sample was 1021 m2 g\u22121, slightly smaller than that of the LAC@HZIF-8-D sample. Table S1\u2020 shows the total surface area alongside the microporous and mesoporous specic surface areas of the ZIF-8 and its immobilized laccase material. The microporous specic surface areas of the LAC@HZIF-8-D and LAC@HZIF-8-P samples were 649 and 610 m2 g\u22121, and their mesoporous areas were 468 and 410 m2 g\u22121, respectively. The large number of mesopores (Fig. 3d) ranging from 2 to 5 nm corresponded to the internal defects of the crystal during the synthesis of HZIF-8.42 The image shows that the 2\u20135 nm mesopores of the LAC@HZIF-8-D were almost unchanged relative to HZIF-8, while mesopores whose sizes equalled the LAC@HZIF-8-P were sharply reduced. This suggests that the added laccase occupied the mesopores of the HZIF-8, reducing the mesoporous surface area, similar to Gao's ndings.43 Moreover, the BET specic surface areas of the MZIF8 and HZIF-8 were 585 and 1153m2 g\u22121, while their mesoporous specic surface areas were 124 and 736 m2 g\u22121, respectively\nFig. 4 (a) The catalytic removal efficiencies of 2,4-DCP over time. (b) T\n17198 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 17194\u201317201\n(Fig. S3\u2020). Thus, the HZIF-8 had a larger specic surface area, a feature attributable to the addition of histidine and CTAB during its synthesis, which functioned as a stable, common template and facilitated the preparation of pure ZIF-8. Additionally, the N2 absorption of nCu/LAC@HZIF-8-D was slightly lower than that of LAC@HZIF-8-D (Fig. 3b). Moreover, as Fig. 3c demonstrates, the micropore-specic surface area of the two changed minimally, while the mesoporous specic surface area of the nCu/LAC@HZIF-8-D signicantly decreased."

The capacity of the LAC@MZIF-8 to remove 2,4-DCP was similar to that of free laccase, with 19.7% and 15.2% removed aer 15 min, respectively. However, at the equivalent time, 79.4% and 81.3% of the 2,4-DCP had been removed using LAC@HZIF-8-D and LAC@HZIF-8-P, respectively, indicating the utility of the HZIF-8 immobilized laccase material for removing 2,4-DCP. Two inferences can be drawn from these results. First, in the multistage framework, the laccase is embedded in the mesoporous channels, while the reactants diffuse through microporous channels and reach the active laccase easily. The products can also be quickly separated from the framework, promoting the catalytic reaction.44\u201346 Second, the high surface energy enables the HZIF-8 to accelerate the diffusion of the laccase from solution into catalyst itself by the adsorption to laccase with the high surface energy of structure of HZIF-8.47 When the capacities of MZIF-8 and HZIF-8 to adsorb 2,4-DCP were studied to conrm the effect of different material structures on the catalyst, it was observed that 17.6% and 45.4% of 2,4-DCP had been adsorbed into the MZIF-8 and HZIF-8 samples aer 15 minutes, respectively. HZIF-8 offers a higher adsorption capacity due to its higher specic surface area, a nding consistent with our ndings in this study and those of Gascon.48 Overall, HZIF-8 has a higher adsorption capacity and better LAC distribution than MZIF-8. These features explain the catalytic removal capacity of the LAC@HZIF-8 material and indicate the tremendous potential of HZIF-8 as a carrier of enzyme immobilization.\nhe recycling ability of LAC@ZIF-8 vs. free laccase.\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Thus, the reusability of the LAC@ZIF-8 material was tested by successive 2,4-DCP removal cycle experiments. Aer three catalytic cycles (Fig. 4b), the LAC@HZIF-8-D maintained a 2,4-DCP removal efficiency of about 80%, a higher level of reusability than that of the LAC@HZIF-8-P. This could be attributed to the strong force resulting from the interaction between the biological interface of the enzyme and the metal ions when the LAC@HZIF-8 was prepared in situ. This force wasmuch greater than that resulting from pore diffusion and the three-dimensional pore adsorption of laccase in LAC@HZIF-8-P. The excellent reusability of LAC@HZIF-8-D is demonstrated by these results. Some of the adsorbed 2,4-DCP remains in the ZIF-8 pores when the LAC@ZIF-8 is recycled, and leaches into the solution at an increased concentration. The removal efficiency decreases indirectly as the capacity of LAC@ZIF-8 to catalyse 2,4-DCP drops.\nWhen the ability of nCu/LAC@HZIF-8 to catalyse 2,4-DCP in water was evaluated, the rate constant was 1.5 times higher than the best performance achieved by LAC@HZIF-8-D. Aer 15 min, the 92.3% of the 2,4-DCP had been removed by the nCu/ LAC@HZIF-8, which was 12.9% higher than that achieved by LAC@HZIF-8-D. Thus, the Cu nanoparticles signicantly improved thematerial's catalytic performance (Fig. 4a), possibly by increasing its electrical conductivity. This result thereby supports the use of nCu/LAC@HZIF-8 for 2,4-DCP removal. Cu is laccase's active metal centre and its nanoparticles may activate laccase catalysis.49 In general, the synthesized nCu/ LAC@HZIF-8 composite can remove more than 90% of 2,4- DCP within 15 min. Overall, the degradation of the catalytic activity of enzymes immobilized on MOFs has been a persistent concern which, the current study shows, can be addressed by adding copper nanoparticles."

The optimum catalytic activity of the LAC@MZIF-8 and LAC@HZIF-8 immobilized laccase samples was achieved at pH 4\u20135, and its catalytic activity was stable under acidic conditions, without any significant decrease. The stability of LAC@ZIF-8 can be attributed to the poor acid stability of ZIF-8 as a sacricial agent.50 However, under neutral and alkaline conditions (pH 7\u20139), the catalytic activity of the three immobilized laccase samples decreased to varying degrees\u2014and fell signicantly under alkaline conditions compared to the free laccase sample. It was speculated that temperature, agitation, ultrasonic interference, and other conditions involved in the process of synthesizing immobilized laccase with ZIF-8 destroyed the enzyme's activity and was manifested in its reduced stability in alkaline pHs.\nIn another noteworthy result, the catalytic activity of the free laccase decreased by 40% under the pH 3 condition, while the catalytic activity of the LAC@ZIF-8 decreased by less than 5%. This poor activity under a lower pH range may be due to the release of Zn2+ as the ZIF-8 skeleton decomposed under acidic conditions, causing the imidazole ligand to bind with H+ in solution. This result indicates that a specic pH buffer is required to limit the destruction of the catalytic activity of the LAC@ZIF-8 under acidic conditions. In addition, it has been reported that various metal ions can activate or inhibit the enzyme activity of laccase.51 Among these, Co2+, Ni2+, Cd2+, Fe3+, Ag+, Al3+, Hg2+, and Fe2+ were strong inhibitors, possibly because they occupied the laccase's active centre and changed its structure, thus inhibiting its enzymatic activity.52,53 However, Na+, Zn2+, Cu2+, and Mg2+ ions can signicantly activate laccase. The activation effect of Cu2+ on laccase is related to the fact that Cu2+ is an active centre of laccase.54 Therefore, the enhanced stability of the LAC@ZIF-8 materials under acidic conditions may be due to the Zn2+ produced by the instability of the ZIF-8 structure, which enhances the enzyme activity of laccase, to a certain extent.\nFig. 5b shows the relative activity changes in 2,4-DCP removal achieved by the LAC, LAC@MZIF-8, LAC@HZIF-8-D, and LAC@HZIF-8-P samples treated at different temperatures (20, 40, 60, and 80 \u00b0C) for 4 h. The catalytic activity of the free laccase was optimal at 40 \u00b0C, decreasing to 93% of this value at 20 \u00b0C. However, at increased temperatures, its catalytic activity\nC@ZIF-8 compared to free laccase.\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 17194\u201317201 | 17199\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

At 80 \u00b0C, the catalytic activity of the laccase dropped to 5.1%, meaning it was almost wholly inactivated, a nding consistent with Wu et al.55 High temperatures destabilize free laccase, causing a loss of activity due to the decomposition of its protein structure. In contrast, the immobilized laccase material was stable at a range of temperatures; the optimum temperature was 60 \u00b0C, with higher catalytic activity observed between approximately 20 and 80 \u00b0C. At 80 \u00b0C, the catalytic activity of the LAC@MZIF-8 and LAC@HZIF-8 was maintained at 72.4 and 86.5% of this value respectively, indicating that the ZIF-8 greatly enhanced laccase durability at high temperatures. These results corroborate earlier research showing that the optimal temperature for immobilized laccase increased as catalytical activation energy rose due to the chelation between the laccase and ZIF-8.56 Moreover, the HZIF-8 demonstrated greater temperature stability than the MZIF-8, a nding related to the latter's poor crystallinity and pore properties.\nFinally, Fig. 5c shows the changes in relative activity among the LAC, LAC@MZIF-8, LAC@HZIF-8-D, and LAC@HZIF-8-P samples aer storage at 4 \u00b0C for 0, 3, 7, and 15 days. Aer 15 days of storage at 4 \u00b0C, the catalytic activities of both the free and immobilized enzyme samples did not decrease signicantly, indicating that laccase has a long storage cycle in optimal storage environments at 4 \u00b0C. However, the immobilized laccase material was more stable than the free laccase, since HZIF-8 retains the catalytic activity from LAC and has greater LAC storage capacity due to its hierarchical pore structure."

In addition, LAC@HZIF-8 also enhanced the thermostability and storage stability of laccase compared to LAC@MZIF-8. Due to the size mismatch between laccase and the material's micropores, post-synthesis embedded laccase at a higher rate than the de novo strategy. However, the latter produced a higher removal efficiency when Cu NPs were added and can potentially broaden the pH stability of laccase. In conclusion, the LAC@HZIF-8-D showed greater promise for environmental applications due to its higher removal efficiency and excellent stability. The design of graded MOF channels and the pore size of mesoporous channels based on the molecular size of enzymes were also signicant in enzyme immobilization.\nAuthor contributions\nXu Ran and Zhang Xujie performed and conducted the experiments, Osamn Ahmend draed the manuscript and analyzed the data, and Wu Yi-nan and Eduardo Schott supervised the study.
