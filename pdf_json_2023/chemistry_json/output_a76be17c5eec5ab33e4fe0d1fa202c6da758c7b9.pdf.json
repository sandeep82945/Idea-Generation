Olaparib, the first approved PARP inhibitor, showed potency in the inhibition of both BRCA (breast cancer associated)mutated and BRCA-unmutated cancers.\nMethods: Aiming to the discovery of olaparib analogs for the treatment of cancer, structural modifications were performed based on the scaffold of olaparib. In the first series, reduction of carbonyl group to CH2 led to decrease of PARP1 inhibitory activity.

The synthesized compounds were evaluated in the in the PARP1 enzyme inhibitory screening, cancer cell based antiproliferative assay, cell cycle arrest and apoptosis studies.\nResults: It is remarkable that, molecule C2 with chlorambucil substitution, exhibited potent PARP1 inhibitory activity and a broad-spectrum of anticancer potency in the in vitro antiproliferative assay. Compared with olaparib and chlorambucil, molecule C2 also showed significant potency in inhibition of a variety of BRCA-unmutated cell lines. Further analysis revealed the effects ofC2 in induction of G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and promotion of apoptosis.\nDiscussion: Collectively, the olaparib-chlorambucil hybrid molecule (C2) could be utilized as a lead compound for further drug design.\nKEYWORDS\nPARP, olaparib, chlorambucil, cancer, structural modification\nIntroduction\nPoly (ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs) are a group of enzymes with the biological function of transferring ADP-ribose to target proteins (Krishnakumar and Kraus, 2010). PARPs play crucial roles in a variety of cellular processes, including regulation of transcription, replication, recombination, apoptosis, and DNA damage response (Pines et al., 2012; Hu et al., 2014). Within the PARP family, PARP1 serves a critical function in DNA repair and has thus received considerable interest as a major target of inhibitor development (Chaudhuri and Nussenzweig, 2017). For more than a decade, inhibition of PARP1 has been a promising therapeutic intervention strategy for cancer (Coyne et al., 2015)."

In synthetically lethal interactions, tumor cells with essential HR gene mutations in the breast cancer-associated 1 and 2 (BRCA1 and BRCA2) genes can be targeted by PARPis (Bryant et al., 2005). PARPis are the first approved antitumor agents targeting the DNA damage response in BRCA1/2-mutated breast and ovarian cancers (Dockery et al., 2017). Several PARP inhibitors, including olaparib (Menear et al., 2008), rucaparib (Thomas et al., 2007), niraparib (Jones et al., 2015), and talazoparib (Shen et al., 2013), are approved for the treatment of ovarian, breast, and pancreatic cancers with BRCA mutations (Figure 1). Olaparib, the first approved small molecule PARPi, is utilized for the treatment of germline BRCA-mutated ovarian and breast cancers. However, there are also some drawbacks that limit the wide application of olaparib, such as its low solubility in both aqueous and lipophilic solutions (Gala et al., 2020). Thus, olaparib was characterized with relatively poor pharmacokinetics profiles and bioavailability (Jackson and Chester, 2015). Therefore, in the search for novel olaparib analogs, we have tested molecules derived from\nFIGURE 1 FDA approved PARP inhibitors utilized for the treatment of cancer.\nFIGURE 2 Design of olaparib derivatives in the SAR study.\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org02\nTABLE 1 Structure and PARP1 inhibitory activities of A series PARP inhibitors.\nCompound R PARP1 (IC50, nMa)\nA1 31.2 \u00b1 2.4\nA2 29.4 \u00b1 2.2\nA3 17.6 \u00b1 1.3\nA4 42.2 \u00b1 4.1\nA5 33.2 \u00b1 3.1\nA6 >50\nA7 24.6 \u00b1 2.1\n(Continued in next column)\nTABLE 1 (Continued) Structure and PARP1 inhibitory activities of A series PARP inhibitors.\nA8 22.5 \u00b1 2.1\nA9 12.6 \u00b1 1.1\nA10 21.4 \u00b1 1.4\nA11 29.4 \u00b1 2.3\nA12 >50\nA13 >50\nA14 >50\nA15 >50\nA16 >50\n(Continued on following page)\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org03\nstructural modification of olaparib. First, the carbonyl group connected to the piperazine ring was reduced to CH2, and a series of olaparib derivatives were synthesized to improve solubility (Figure 2). In further structural derivatization, hydrazide and aromatic nitrogen mustard groups were introduced without reduction of the carbonyl group. The synthesized molecules were evaluated using PARP1 enzyme inhibitory screening and cancer cellbased antiproliferative assays and apoptosis studies."

Target compounds A1\u2013A12 were derived by condensation of 2c with 1b\u201312b, and compounds A13\u2013A23 were synthesized by reacting 2c with various substituted piperazines and piperidines.

A series of olaparib derivatives were synthesized with improved water solubility and liposolubility. To evaluate the PARP1 inhibitory activity of the synthesized compounds, the enzyme-based test was performed. As shown in Table 1, all the derived A series compounds exhibited decreased potency compared with olaparib. In this series, cycloalkane formyl substitutions in piperazine showed relatively high inhibitory activity; these included moleculesA21,A22, andA23. AmongA1\u2013A3, fluorine substitution in the meta-position of the phenyl ring resulted in improved PARP1 inhibitory activity. The CF3 substitution in the benzene ring (A4\u2013A6) led to decreased activity compared with the fluorine substitution. A methyl group in the ortho-position of the phenyl ring (A9) increased inhibitory activity. Compounds with a methoxy group in the phenyl ring (A11 and A13) did not show favorable activity, while the 1,3-dioxole substitution (A20) increased inhibitory potency. Replacement of the carbonyl group with a methylene group between piperazine and the phenyl ring (A15 and A18) decreased PARP1 inhibitory potency. The substituted piperidine R groups (A14 and A16\u2013A19) exhibited reduced inhibitory potency compared with the substituted piperazine groups.\nThe binding of inhibitors to the active site of receptors may be key factors that influence inhibitory enzyme potency. Therefore, the crystal structure of olaparib in the active site of PARP1 (PDB entry: 7AAD) was analyzed to identify the structural elements that affect PARP1 inhibitory activity. As shown in Figure 3, the carbonyl group of olaparib could form H-bond interaction with the amino group of Tyr896. The generated H-bond interaction makes an important contribution to the binding of olaparib to the active site of PARP1, with a distance of 2.811 \u00c5 between atoms (between the oxygen atom of the carbonyl group and the nitrogen atom of Tyr896). Compared with olaparib, the decreased activity of A series compounds was deduced to be due to the loss of H-bond interaction resulting from the reduction of the carbonyl group.\nConsidering the importance of the carbonyl group in the structure of olaparib for PARP1 binding, the CO group was retained for further olaparib analog design. Hydrazides with various alkane substitutions were then introduced. The corresponding B series molecules were synthesized, and alkanes of different lengths were utilized to regulate the binding and\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org04\nsolubility of target compounds. Nitrogen mustards are known alkylating agents that exert their anticancer activities depending on DNA damage. The aromatic nitrogen mustard groups have been widely used in the design of hybrid anticancer molecules (Chen et al., 2018). It is significant that nitrogen mustards exert their function by damaging DNA, while PARP1 inhibitors prevent DNA repair. Therefore, development of bifunctional alkylating-PARP1\ninhibitor molecules may lead to therapeutic agents with synergistic anticancer activities. In this study, to verify the proposed theory, aromatic nitrogen mustard pharmacophores were introduced into the structure of olaparib.\nThe PARP1 inhibitory activities of B series compounds and nitrogen mustard containing C1 and C2 were determined using the enzymatic assay (Table 2). Among the B series molecules, compound B3, with an alkyl chain length of four carbon atoms, exhibited the highest inhibitory activity, with an IC50 value of 2.8 nM, compared with olaparib (IC50 value of 1.0 nM). Increase or decrease of the alkyl chain length resulted in reduction of PARP1 inhibitory potency. It is also important to note that the compound with branched alkane (B4) had reduced activity compared with compounds with straight alkanes. Overall, the B series compounds exhibited potent PARP1 inhibitory activity compared with olaparib.\nC series compounds are hybrid molecules with aromatic nitrogen mustard substituted in the piperazine of olaparib. The compound with a long linker (C2) exhibited better enzyme inhibitory activity than the compound with a short linker (C1). Compared with olaparib (IC50 value of 1.0 nM), molecule C2 had an IC50 value of .9 nM in inhibition of PARP1 activity. These data suggest that introduction of an aromatic nitrogen mustard group improves PARP1 inhibitory activity and that the olaparib\u2013chlorambucil hybrid molecule C2 could be utilized for further evaluation as a potent PARP1 inhibitor.\nSCHEME 1 Synthesis of target compounds.

            "text": "It has been reported that olaparib has potential efficacy in tumors lacking DNA repair defects (Gelmon et al., 2011; Poveda et al., 2019). The existence of non-DNA repair functions of PARP1 provides targetable opportunities for anticancer drug development (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011; Weaver and Yang, 2013). Therefore, both BRCAmutated cell lines (MDA-MB-436, Capan-1, and HCC 1937) and cell lines without BRCAmutations (K562, Raji, 8226, U87, B16, SKOV3,MCF7, SW620, A549,MDA-MB-231, CH151, U251, andHela) were utilized for the antiproliferative assay. Olaparib and the alkylating agent chlorambucil were used as the positive control. Only molecules with high PARP1 inhibitory activities (B3, C1, and C2) were selected for the cancer cell-based assay. As shown in Table 3, compound B3 exhibited very limited antiproliferative activity against the tested cell lines compared with olaparib. These data suggest that the performed hydrazide substitutions could not improve the potency of olaparib in both enzymatic and antiproliferative tests. In inhibition of the BRCA-mutated cell lines (MDA-MB-436, Capan-1, and HCC 1937), molecule C2 showed activity similar to olaparib. Compared with the positive control, molecule C2 exhibited high potency in inhibition of several BRCA-unmutated cell lines, such as K562, Raji, U87, MCF-7, A549, CH151, U251, and Hela cells. It was deduced that the chlorambucil\npart of C2 contributed to the antiproliferative activity against BRCAunmutated cells. It was interesting that molecule C1 selectively inhibited the growth of A549 cells without obvious inhibitory activity against other BRCA-unmutated cells. These data suggest that molecule C1 could be used as a lead compound for the design of anticancer drugs for the treatment of lung cancer. In summary, molecule C2 exhibited high anticancer activity in vitro in the antiproliferative test, and the olaparib\u2013nitrogen mustard hybridization strategy demonstrated good potential as anticancer therapy."

As shown in Figure 4, C2 and chlorambucil increased cell number at the G2/M phase in a dose-dependent manner. The proportion of cells in the G2/M phase increased from 0% to 45.9% with C2 treatment (corresponding to concentration increase from 1.25 to 5.0 \u00b5M); with chlorambucil treatment, cells at the G2/M phase increased from 0% to\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org08\n61.60% when concentration was increased from 2.5 to 10 \u00b5M. However, at the tested concentrations of 2.5\u201310 \u00b5M, olaparib did not exhibit any effects on regulation of cell cycle in K562 cells. The BRCA1-mutated HCC1937 human breast cancer cell line was also utilized to evaluate the cell cycle arrest patterns induced by molecule C2, olaparib, and chlorambucil. Figure 5 reveals that all the tested compounds increased cell proportion in the G2/M phase. These results suggest that induction of G2/M phase arrest plays an important role in the in vitro anticancer effects of molecule C2."

            "text": "Inhibition of PARPs has emerged as a research focus in the development of targeted cancer treatments. Four PARP inhibitors are currently approved for clinical use: olaparib, rucaparib,\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org09\nniraparib, and talazoparib. As the first approved PARP inhibitor, olaparib exhibited potency in the inhibition of both BRCA-mutated and BRCA-unmutated cancers. In development of novel PARP inhibitors as anticancer drugs, modifications have been made to the structure of olaparib. In the current study, 31 compounds were designed, synthesized, and tested for activity. Among the derived molecules, an olaparib\u2013chlorambucil hybrid molecule (C2) exhibited high potency in the inhibition of PARP1 activity and showed high antiproliferative activity against a group of cancer lines. Notably, in the inhibition of multiple BRCA-unmutated cancer cells, molecule C2 showed improved anticancer activity in vitro compared with olaparib and chlorambucil. Analysis of the cell cycle and apoptosis showed that G2/M phase cell cycle arrest and apoptosis are involved in the anticancer effects of C2. Our study led to the discovery of a potent PARP1 inhibitor\u2013chlorambucil hybrid compound with strong anticancer effects. Our results also revealed the potential of PARP inhibitor\u2013chemotherapeutic drug hybrids in the treatment of cancer."
