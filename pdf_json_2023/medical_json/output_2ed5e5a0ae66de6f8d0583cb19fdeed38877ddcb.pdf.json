Crosstalk\nbetween the pro-inflammatory TNF-\u03b1-NF\u03baB signaling axis and the canonical\nWnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway potentially plays an important role in\nregulating endothelial dysfunction, though the exact nature of this is\nnot defined.\nResults: In this study, cultured endothelial cells were challenged with TNF-\u03b1\nand the potential of a Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling inhibitor, iCRT-14, in reversing\nthe adverse effects of TNF-\u03b1 on endothelial physiology was evaluated.\nTreatment with iCRT-14 lowered nuclear and total NF\u03baB protein levels, as\nwell as expression of NF\u03baB target genes, IL-8 and MCP-1. Inhibition of \u03b2-\ncatenin activity with iCRT-14 suppressed TNF-\u03b1-induced monocyte adhesion\nand decreased VCAM-1 protein levels. Treatment with iCRT-14 also restored\nendothelial barrier function and increased levels of ZO-1 and focal adhesion-\nassociated phospho-paxillin (Tyr118). Interestingly, inhibition of \u03b2-catenin with\niCRT-14 enhanced platelet adhesion in cultured TNF-\u03b1-stimulated endothelial\ncells and in an ex vivo human saphenous vein model, most likely via elevating\nlevels of membrane-tethered vWF. Wound healing was moderately retarded\nby iCRT-14; hence, inhibition of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling may interfere with\nre-endothelialisation in grafted saphenous vein conduits.\nConclusion: Inhibition of the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway with iCRT-\n14 significantly recovered normal endothelial function by decreasing\ninflammatory cytokine production, monocyte adhesion and endothelial\npermeability. However, treatment of cultured endothelial cells with\nFrontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 01 frontiersin.org\niCRT-14 also exerted a pro-coagulatory and moderate anti-wound healing\neffect: these factors may affect the suitability of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin inhibition as a\ntherapy for atherosclerosis and vein graft failure.\nKEYWORDS\nWnt/\u03b2-catenin, TNF-\u03b1, NF\u03baB, endothelium, monocyte, permeability, platelet, atherosclerosis"

            "text": "The endothelium bears enormous physiological importance by serving to modulate inflammatory processes, selective passage of materials across the vessel wall, vascular tone and blood viscosity. Detrimental shifts in endothelial behavior are collectively referred to as \u201cendothelial dysfunction\u201d and are tightly correlated with early-and late-stage atherosclerosis and saphenous vein graft degeneration (1, 2). Such phenotypic shifts include elevated levels of secreted inflammatory cytokines, compromised barrier function, an upregulation of adhesion molecules, and reduced anti-coagulatory potential.\nCurrent research stresses the significance of endothelial dysfunction in the pathogenesis and progression of atherosclerosis. Increased endothelial permeability at lesionprone sites in the arterial vasculature permits infiltration of circulating low density lipoprotein (LDL) (3), setting in motion a cascade of pathogenic events. Presentation of adhesion molecules on the endothelial surface promotes monocyte attachment and recruitment (4\u20136). Endothelial-and macrophage-derived pro-inflammatory signals also stimulate medial vascular smooth muscle cell (VSMC) intimal migration and proliferation, culminating in intimal hyperplasia (5). Hence, endothelial dysfunction is an essential component in the initiation and development of atherosclerotic lesions.\nSaphenous vein graft degeneration is also a direct consequence of endothelial dysfunction. During coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery, transient hypoxia (7), high pressure distension (8), and handling of the vein conduit during harvest and implantation (9) damages the endothelium and exacerbates dysfunction. Endothelial denudation accounts for thrombotic occlusion typically within the one month of surgery in 3\u201312% of patients (10, 11). Non-occlusive thrombi may also become progressively organized into vascular tissue, in which platelets release cytokines and growth factors that compound inflammation, VSMC proliferation and neointima formation (12). Thus, in designing novel therapeutic interventions for endothelial dysfunction in vein graft failure, one must also consider whether the approach would impair re-endothelialisation and elevate risk of thrombus formation.\nThe TNF-\u03b1-NF\u03baB signaling axis is a highly potent proinflammatory pathway and mediates multiple aspects of endothelial dysfunction. Reciprocal cross-regulation between\nthe canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and NF\u03baB signaling pathways is complex as there are multiple regulatory mechanisms, the nature of which can be either repressive or enhancing (see Figure 1 for mechanisms of signal transduction) (13). Crosstalk as such enables individual pathways to broaden their range of biological function (13); in turn, this implies that pharmacological inhibitors targeting any one pathway may also be able to extend their therapeutic effect. In this study, we demonstrate the capacity of a Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling inhibitor, iCRT-14, to repress NF\u03baB activation as well as partially recover a non-inflammatory, functional state in endothelial cells of arterial and venous origin."

(A) (Left panel) In the absence of a Wnt stimulus, \u03b2-catenin is phosphorylated by the destruction complex targeting it for poly-ubiquitination and subsequent proteasome-mediated proteolysis. Low cytoplasmic levels of \u03b2-catenin permit repression of LEF/TCF-dependent transcription by Groucho/TLE. (Right panel) Binding of Wnt ligands to the Frizzled/LRP5/6 receptor complex promotes recruitment of Disheveled and Axin, resulting in disassembly of the \u03b2-catenin destruction complex. Cytoplasmic accumulation of \u03b2-catenin allows for its nuclear translocation, where \u03b2-catenin displaces Groucho/TLE from LEF/TCF, enabling transcriptional regulation. (B) Binding of the TNF-\u03b1 ligand to the TNF receptor recruits, phosphorylates and activates the IKK complex via oligomerisation of a series of adaptor proteins. In turn, the activated IKK complex phosphorylates I\u03baB\u03b1, resulting in poly-ubiquitination of I\u03baB\u03b1 and its rapid proteasomal degradation.

Endothelial cells were simultaneously treated with either 25 \u00b5M of inhibitor of \u03b2-catenin-responsive transcription-14 (iCRT-14) or 0.05% DMSO vehicle control. Cells not stimulated with TNF-\u03b1 served as a negative control. The small molecule compound iCRT-14 has been reported to display low promiscuity and to potently inhibit the canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway (IC50 = 40.3 nM) (14, 15). Gonsalves and colleagues showed that iCRT-14 suppresses this pathway by most likely blocking the interface via which \u03b2catenin and T-cell factor 4 (TCF4) interact, thereby leading to impairment of transcriptional regulation of downstream genes (14, 15). Additionally, the authors demonstrated that, at a dose of 25 \u00b5M, iCRT-14 does not indiscriminately interfere with other protein partners of \u03b2-catenin such as E-cadherin and \u03b1-catenin, thereby conserving the function of \u03b2-catenin in stabilizing adherens junctions, and that it does not modulate \u03b2-catenin-independent non-canonical Wnt signaling. Gonsalves et al. also established that in addition to inhibiting \u03b2-catenin-TCF4 protein-protein interaction, iCRT-14 may also influence binding of TCF/LEF transcription factors to their consensus DNA binding sites, providing a further mechanism for suppression of \u03b2-catenin and TCF-mediated signaling (14).\nFrontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 05 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 2 Inhibition of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling disrupted the inflammatory TNF-\u03b1-NF\u03baB signaling axis.

As anticipated, activation of HUVECs with TNF-\u03b1 reduced I\u03baB\u03b1 protein expression compared to control group; addition of 25 \u00b5M iCRT-14 did not restore or otherwise significantly influence I\u03baB\u03b1 levels (Figure 2A). TNF-\u03b1 promoted nuclear localization of NF\u03baB as expected (Figures 2C, D); additional treatment with iCRT-14 lowered levels of nuclear NF\u03baB with respect to HUVECs treated with TNF-\u03b1 alone (Figures 2C, D). Western blotting with whole cell lysates showed that TNF-\u03b1 did not consistently or significantly increase total NF\u03baB protein levels; interestingly, addition of iCRT-14 significantly suppressed total NF\u03baB levels compared to cells treated with TNF-\u03b1 alone (Figure 2B). These findings suggest that canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling facilitates the inflammatory NF\u03baB pathway in TNF-\u03b1-activated endothelial cells.\nNF\u03baB is a central mediator of pro-inflammatory cytokine production. ELISA immunoassays showed a surge in release of MCP-1, IL-6, and IL-8 cytokines in response to challenge of HUVECs and HCAECs with TNF-\u03b1. Treatment with iCRT-14 significantly reversed levels of secreted MCP-1 and IL-8, but not IL-6 in both cell types (Table 1).\nInhibition of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling lowered leukocyte adhesion\nConfluent HUVECs and HCAECs were unchallenged or stimulated with 10 ng/mL recombinant human TNF-\u03b1 for 18 h, in the presence of 0.05% DMSO vehicle control or 25 \u00b5M iCRT-14. Endothelial cells were then co-cultured with calcein-AM-labeled THP-1 cells, a human monocytic cell line, and adherent cells quantified. In unchallenged HUVECs, treatment with iCRT-14 did not influence endothelial-THP-1 cell interaction (Supplementary Figure 1A). Consistent with current literature, TNF-\u03b1 produced a notable increase in the number of adherent monocytic cells (Figures 3A, B). This was significantly dampened by addition of iCRT-14, demonstrating the potential anti-inflammatory benefits of pharmacologically suppressing canonical Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling (Figures 3A, B).\nTNF-\u03b1-induced transcriptional up-regulation of vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1) and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) via NF\u03baB activation is well-documented (16). Concordantly, in both HUVECs and HCAECs, Western blotting confirmed a marked induction in VCAM-1 and ICAM1 following TNF-\u03b1 stimulation, where no protein was detected in unstimulated cells (Figures 3C\u2013F). Treatment with iCRT14 significantly reversed the elevation in VCAM-1 expression (Figures 3C, E), though did not consistently lower ICAM-1 levels (Figures 3D, F). These data propose VCAM-1 depletion as one such mechanism by which the compound iCRT14 impeded firm adhesion of THP-1 cells to the activated endothelial cells.\nInhibition of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling restored endothelial barrier function\nTNF-\u03b1-NF\u03baB signaling is a known contributor of increased endothelial permeability (17\u201319). To evaluate the potential of iCRT-14 in restoring endothelial barrier function, HUVECs and HCAECs were unchallenged or stimulated with 10 ng/mL recombinant human TNF-\u03b1 for 18 h, and concurrently treated with either 0.05% DMSO vehicle control or 25 \u00b5M iCRT14; endothelial permeability was then assessed by quantifying streptavidin-HRP leakage across the monolayer. In HUVECs unchallenged by TNF-\u03b1, addition of iCRT-14 did not affect endothelial permeability (Supplementary Figure 1B). As expected, TNF-\u03b1 disrupted the intact HUVEC and HCAEC monolayers, and treatment with iCRT-14 successfully prevented this disruption to barrier function demonstrating its capacity to reduce vascular leakage (Figures 4A, B).\nVascular endothelial (VE)-cadherin is the cornerstone of endothelial barrier maintenance (20, 21). In this study, immunofluorescence confirmed an abundance of VE-cadherin protein at the cell-cell junctions in HUVECs (Figure 4D). A dramatic reduction in membrane-localized VE-cadherin following stimulation of cells with TNF-\u03b1 was observed (Figure 4D), consistent with previous observations (22, 23). Curiously, despite improving barrier function, addition of iCRT14 did not salvage levels of membrane-localized VE-cadherin (Figure 4D).\nZonula occludens (ZO) proteins are essential for the assembly and organization of tight junction complexes (17, 24, 25). In HUVECs, TNF-\u03b1-stimulation lowered levels of ZO-1 localized to the cell membrane (Figure 4E). Treatment with iCRT-14 restored levels of membrane-associated ZO-1 (Figure 4E).\nPaxillin is a focal adhesion-associated adaptor protein that is phosphorylated at multiple residues, including Tyr118, upon engagement of integrins with extracellular matrix (26). Stimulation of HUVECs with TNF-\u03b1 significantly increased the number of active focal adhesions, as indicated by immunofluorescence for phospho-paxillin (Tyr118); this increase was further enhanced by addition of iCRT-14 (Figures 4C, F).\nInhibition of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling increased platelet adhesion\nBoth unstimulated and TNF-\u03b1-stimulated HUVECs and HCAECs were treated with either 0.05% DMSO vehicle control or 25 \u00b5M iCRT-14 for 18 h; endothelial cells were then cocultured with activated platelets and adherence quantified. TNF\u03b1 did not significantly enhance platelet adhesion to HUVECs or HCAECs (Figures 5A, B).

Secreted inflammatory cytokines were quantified by ELISA, and results expressed as TNF-\u03b1 + iCRT as a percentage difference from TNF-\u03b1 (n = 4\u20136). *Indicates p < 0.05.\nof bound platelets were significantly increased by iCRT-14 in TNF-\u03b1-stimulated HUVECs and HCAECs (Figures 5A, B). To determine whether these findings translated to an ex vivo model, intact segments of human saphenous vein treated with either 0.05% DMSO or 25 \u00b5M iCRT-14 for 18 h, then co-cultured with activated platelets and bound platelets counted. As observed in isolated endothelial cells, treatment with iCRT-14 increased platelet adhesion (Figure 5D).\nThe endothelial vitronectin receptor (integrin \u03b1v\u03b23) mediates platelet-endothelial interaction (27, 28). In TNF\u03b1-stimulated HUVECs, Western blotting demonstrated up-regulation of integrin \u03b1v compared to the untreated controls; this induction was significantly reversed by iCRT-14 (Figures 5C, E). Treatment with iCRT-14 did not alter integrin \u03b1v protein levels in unstimulated HUVECs (Figures 5C, E). Neither activation with TNF-\u03b1 nor treatment with iCRT-14 influenced integrin \u03b23 expression in HUVECs (Figure 5C).\nUltra-large multimers of von Willebrand factor (vWF) presented at the endothelial surface are reported to facilitate interaction of platelets and platelet microparticles with the intact endothelium (29, 30). Specifically, the A1 domain of membranebound endothelial vWF binds platelet glycoprotein Ib\u03b1 and thereby promotes platelet recruitment and aggregation (29, 30). Ultra-large vWF multimers are stored in the Weibel-Palade bodies of endothelial cells and are released upon endothelial cell activation (31, 32); here, storage of vWF in Weibel-Palade bodies was visualized by immunostaining permeabilised HUVECs for vWF. In unstimulated HUVECs, iCRT-14 did not exert any effect on the amount of vWF stored in Weibel-Palade bodies (Figures 5F, G). As anticipated, activation of HUVECs with TNF-\u03b1 lowered Weibel-Palade body-associated vWF; this action was not amplified or otherwise influenced by addition of iCRT-14 (Figures 5F, G). To evaluate levels of surface-bound vWF, immunofluorescence for vWF was performed on nonpermeabilised HUVECs: TNF-\u03b1 stimulation did not change the amount of membrane-bound vWF with respect to control cells; levels of membrane-tethered vWF were however markedly elevated by iCRT-14 in TNF-\u03b1-activated HUVECs but not unstimulated HUVECs (Figures 5H, I).\nUltra-large vWF multimers associated with the endothelial surface are proteolytically cleaved at the site of the A2 domain\nby ADAMTS13 (A disintegrin-like and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type-1 repeats-13) such that the plateletinteracting A1 domain of vWF is released (33, 34). Western blotting performed on conditioned culture medium collected from HUVECs confirmed an elevation in levels of ADAMTS13 and soluble vWF following treatment with TNF-\u03b1 (Figures 5C, J, K). Addition of iCRT-14 produced a significant decline in TNF-\u03b1-induced ADAMTS13 and soluble vWF protein levels; this response did not occur in unstimulated HUVECs (Figures 5C, J, K).\nInhibition of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling moderately impaired endothelial regrowth following wounding\nThe effect of iCRT-14 on endothelial cell regrowth, survival and proliferation was examined to evaluate whether the compound would impair post-operative re-endothelialisation in saphenous vein grafts. Scratch wound assays indicated that iCRT-14 did not influence wound closure in unstimulated HUVECs but did moderately retard re-endothelialisation in TNF-\u03b1-stimulated cells (Figures 6A, D). Inhibition of \u03b2-catenin activity with iCRT-14 significantly enhanced cell survival in unstimulated HUVECs but had no effect on apoptosis in TNF-\u03b1-treated cells, as determined by immunofluorescence for cleaved caspase-3 (Figure 6B). Treatment with iCRT14 suppressed cell replication in unstimulated and TNF-\u03b1activated HUVECs, which was analyzed by quantifying EdU incorporation (Figure 6C)."

Reciprocal crosstalk between both pathways forge a complex regulatory network that, depending on context, may be inhibitory or stimulatory (13). In this study, in primary cultures of endothelial cells, we demonstrated that suppressing \u03b2-catenin activity with the pharmacological inhibitor iCRT-14 reduced levels of NF\u03baB protein in both the nuclear compartment and in whole cell lysates. We further reported that treatment with iCRT-14 significantly diminished TNF-\u03b1-driven secretion of inflammatory cytokines IL-8 and MCP-1, but not IL-6. Hence, our findings indicate that in cultured endothelial cells stimulated with TNF-\u03b1, Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling has a stimulatory effect on NF\u03baB activity and supports a pro-inflammatory phenotype. Interestingly, the majority of the current literature on this subject matter presents the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway as antiinflammatory and as an antagonist of NF\u03baB activity (13, 35\u2013 40); however, some studies have reported positive modulation of NF\u03baB signaling by \u03b2-catenin (41\u201346), as reported here.\nFrontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 08 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 3 Inhibition of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling reduced TNF-\u03b1-induced monocyte-adhesion.

This and other studies highlight the importance of context in determining the nature of crosstalk between the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and NF\u03baB signaling pathways.\nInhibition of \u03b2-catenin activity with iCRT-14 appeared to impair TNF-\u03b1-driven nuclear translocation of NF\u03baB, suggesting that iCRT-14 might have promoted I\u03baB\u03b1-dependent cytoplasmic retention of NF\u03baB. Numerous mechanisms described for positive regulation of NF\u03baB activity by the Wnt/\u03b2catenin signaling pathway involve enhanced degradation of I\u03baB\u03b1; for example, \u03b2-catenin/TCF-mediated induction of \u03b2-TrCP expression (\u03b2-transducin repeats-containing protein)\nFrontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 09 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 4 Inhibition of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling restored barrier function in TNF-\u03b1-stimulated endothelial cells.

Peroxisome proliferator activated receptor-\u03b3 (PPAR-\u03b3) reportedly mediates ubiquitination and proteasome-dependent degradation of both cytoplasmic and nuclear NF\u03baB (48). In mammalian cells, PPAR-\u03b3 and \u03b2-catenin operate in an opposite manner (49\u201354). Furthermore, Liu et al. demonstrated that mutation of key residues within the LEF/TCF binding domain of \u03b2-catenin abolish its ability to interact with PPAR-\u03b3 and inhibit PPAR-\u03b3 activity (55). As mentioned, it is thought that iCRT-14 disrupts \u03b2-catenin transcriptional activity by directly blocking the interface via which \u03b2-catenin and TCF4 interact. Hence,\nit is conceivable that iCRT-14 also blocks \u03b2-catenin-PPAR-\u03b3 interaction, thereby promoting PPAR-\u03b3 activity and PPAR\u03b3-driven ubiquitination and degradation of NF\u03baB. However, further investigation is needed to advance and solidify our understanding of mechanisms underlying positive regulation of NF\u03baB activity by the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling pathway.\nWe have provided evidence here that inhibition of \u03b2-catenin activity with iCRT-14 notably restricts monocyte adhesion to both venous and arterial endothelial cells activated by TNF-\u03b1; therefore, we present a potential strategy for alleviating immune cell infiltration into the vessel wall during atherosclerosis and\nFrontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 12 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 7 Schematic diagram illustrating effect of inhibition of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling on endothelial-platelet interaction in unchallenged and TNF-\u03b1-challenged cultured endothelial cells. Endothelial cells were treated with either 0.05% DMSO vehicle control or 25 \u00b5M iCRT in the presence or absence of 10 ng/mL recombinant human TNF-\u03b1 stimulus for 18 h, then co-cultured with thrombin-activated platelets for 10 min. (A) Control: Unchallenged endothelial cells treated with 0.05% DMSO vehicle control. UL-vWF multimers remain stored in the Weibel-Palade bodies.

Regarding the mechanism of this effect, treatment with iCRT-14 attenuated TNF-\u03b1-driven expression of VCAM-1 protein, but not ICAM-1 protein, though NF\u03baBdependent transcriptional activation of both VCAM-1 and ICAM-1 is well-documented (16). The Wnt/\u03b2-catenin pathway appears to differentially regulate NF\u03baB target genes (38, 56). In human lung fibroblasts stimulated with IL-1\u03b2, activation of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling with Wnt-3a had divergent effects\non NF\u03baB target genes: VCAM-1 transcript levels were further elevated, while ICAM-1 expression was uninfluenced, and IL6 gene expression was repressed (38). These data align with our observations in endothelial cells, and together our studies further expose the sophisticated and complex nature of crosstalk between the Wnt/\u03b2-catenin and NF\u03baB signaling pathways.\nIncreased vascular permeability often underlies the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases\nFrontiers in Cardiovascular Medicine 13 frontiersin.org\n(57). We demonstrate here that following TNF-\u03b1 challenge, inhibition of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin with iCRT-14 partially recovers endothelial monolayer integrity in a fashion that appears to be independent of VE-cadherin and dependent on tight junctions. In addition to cell-cell adhesion, anchorage of the endothelial lining to the underlying matrix via focal adhesions is essential for maintenance of barrier function (58). Here, treatment of cultured endothelial cells with iCRT-14 augmented the number of phospho-paxillin (Tyr118)-positive, active focal adhesions. Current literature suggests that the effect of tyrosine 118 phosphorylation on vascular integrity depends on context, with most sources interestingly pointing to a resultant increase in endothelial permeability (59). Fu et al., however, demonstrated that in human lung microvascular endothelial cells, hepatocyte growth factor challenge enhanced endothelial barrier function and that this response required Y118 paxillin phosphorylation (60). Hence, in addition to restoring tight junctions, it is conceivable that iCRT-14 improved endothelial monolayer integrity via elevating the number of focal adhesions engaged with and anchored to the underlying extracellular matrix.\nOur findings have so far suggested that inhibition of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin signaling holds potential therapeutic benefit by suppressing inflammatory responses and maintaining vascular integrity. The effect of iCRT-14 on platelet recruitment was then examined to evaluate whether the compound may adversely promote thrombus formation in either unstimulated or activated endothelial cells. Platelet adhesion assays revealed that treatment of both HUVECs and HCAECs with iCRT-14 facilitated endothelial-platelet interaction in TNF-\u03b1-challenged cells but not unchallenged cells. These findings were mirrored ex vivo in surgically prepared segments of human saphenous vein, where harvesting and handling of the venous material itself is known to damage and activate the endothelium (7\u20139). We propose that treatment with iCRT-14 facilitated platelet binding to TNF-\u03b1-activated endothelial cells by blocking the observed TNF-\u03b1-induced increase in secreted ADAMTS13 protein levels, thereby maintaining high levels of membrane-bound vWF (Figure 7). We suggest that treatment of unstimulated endothelial cells with iCRT-14 did not promote platelet adhesion as this requires TNF-\u03b1-driven release of vWF from Weibel-Palade bodies (Figure 7). Regarding the action of iCRT-14 in platelet recruitment, our data do not suggest a role for the vitronectin receptor. Of note, activation of cultured endothelial cells with TNF-\u03b1 alone did not promote platelet binding; Tull et al. reported similar results but added that TNF-\u03b1 did markedly enhance platelet adhesion when administered in combination with other inflammatory cytokines such as IL-1\u03b2 and TGF-\u03b21 (61). It may be that in endothelial cells stimulated with TNF-\u03b1 alone, ADAMTS13-mediated proteolytic cleavage of membrane-tethered vWF hinders endothelial-platelet interaction. However, involvement of other inflammatory\ncytokines such as TGF-\u03b21 alters this event such that a matrix of membrane-tethered vWF can form across the endothelial surface (61). Post-translational regulation of vWF is hence also sophisticated and complex and so the pro-coagulatory effects of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin inhibition highlighted here need further investigation.\nIn this study, we have revealed that inhibition of Wnt/\u03b2catenin signaling in TNF-\u03b1-activated endothelial cells holds multiple anti-inflammatory benefits including a reduction in inflammatory cytokine production, a decline monocyte recruitment and recovery of vascular integrity. This was demonstrated in cultured endothelial cells of both venous and arterial origin, and therefore has relevance for vein graft failure and atherosclerosis, respectively. The observed prothrombotic effects of iCRT-14 treatment suggest that caution should be exercised in the employment of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin inhibitors as a therapy for vein graft stenosis and atherosclerosis; however, this effect may diminish in an alternative context, such as an in vivo environment, or when administered in conjunction with anti-platelet therapies such as aspirin and clopidogrel. Furthermore, some studies substantiate that in regions of endothelial denudation, platelet recruitment is in fact beneficial for re-endothelialisation (62, 63). The antiproliferative action of iCRT also implies that it may not be a suitable therapy immediately following CABG surgery so as to allow re-endothelialisation of the vein graft; the pro-survival effect of Wnt/\u03b2-catenin inhibition may however be useful in the prevention of endothelial loss in late-stage atherosclerosis."
