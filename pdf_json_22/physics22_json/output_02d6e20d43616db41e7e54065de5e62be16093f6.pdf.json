INTRODUCTION\nFuture space-based gravitational wave observatories, such as the Laser Interferometer Space Antenna (LISA) [1\u20133], will extend gravitational wave science into the lowfrequency, milli-Hertz (mHz) regime. Sensitivity to a new frequency band will facilitate the observation of new astrophysical sources, including extreme-mass-ratio inspirals (EMRIs) [4], binaries in which a stellar-mass compact object (mass \u00b5 \u223c 10M ) gradually inspirals into a massive black hole (mass M \u223c 106M ). EMRIs are characterized by their small mass-ratios = \u00b5/M \u223c 10\u22127\u221210\u22124 and the multiperiodic structure of their long inspirals. A typical EMRI possesses three orbital frequencies1 [5]\u2014the azimuthal frequency \u2126\u03c6 of the small body\u2019s revolution about the massive black hole, the radial frequency \u2126r of the small body\u2019s libration between pericenter and apocenter, and the polar frequency \u2126\u03b8 of the small body\u2019s nutating orbital plane. The orbital frequencies slowly evolve as the small body completes & \u22121 orbital cycles before merger. The orbital evolution is imprinted in the gravitational waves radiated by the binary, leading to signals filled with rich harmonic structure that persist for months to years in the mHz band. Consequently, the cumulative signal-to-noise ratios of these sources will range from tens to hundreds, providing unprecedented tests of general relativity and high-precision measurements of EMRI masses and spins [6, 7].\nAn interesting feature of EMRIs is that, due to their evolving tri-periodic motion, many EMRIs will experience special orbital configurations known as orbital resonances. Resonances occur when at least two frequencies of motion form a rational low-integer ratio (e.g., \u2126r/\u2126\u03b8 = 1/2). For EMRIs, transient orbital r\u03b8 resonances\u2014resonances that form between \u2126r and \u2126\u03b8\u2014\n\u2217 zachary.nasipak@nasa.gov 1 If we neglect the spin of the smaller compact object.\nare particularly important.2 They persist for a resonant timescale Tres \u223c M \u22121/2, and, depending on the orbital phase at which the EMRI enters the resonance, they can enhance or diminish the binary\u2019s gravitational wave emission [15\u201317]. This alters the inspiral by speeding up or slowing down the system\u2019s adiabatic loss of orbital energy and angular momentum (and Carter constant), which leaves a measurable impact on the gravitational waveform [18]. Almost all EMRIs are expected to encounter at least one r\u03b8 resonance as they emit observable mHz gravitational waves [19]. Therefore, failing to accurately model these resonances can hamper the detection and characterization of EMRIs by future space-based gravitational wave detectors [16, 18, 20]. In this work, we model the impact of different perturbative effects on the leading-order evolution of a binary as it passes through different r\u03b8-resonances."

            "text": "EMRIs are naturally modeled within the framework of perturbation theory and the self-force. In the selfforce approach, the small body is treated as a perturbing particle orbiting in the stationary background spacetime associated with the massive black hole [21, 22]. As the small body orbits in this background, it interacts with its own perturbations, resulting in a gravitational selfforce (GSF) that provides O( ) corrections to the motion. The conservative (time symmetric) perturbations induce a GSF that is responsible for nonsecular changes in the orbit, while the dissipative (time antisymmetric) perturbations lead to a GSF that drives the adiabatic\n2 Other orbital resonances are either astrophysically improbable, such as sustained r\u03b8 resonances [8], or they are expected to have a weak, immeasurable effect on EMRI gravitational wave signals, such as r\u03c6 and \u03b8\u03c6 resonances [9, 10]. EMRIs can also experience other resonances, such as tidal resonances [11\u201314], which we do not consider in this work.\nar X\niv :2\n20 7.\n02 22\n4v 2\n[ gr\n-q c]\n2 3\nSe p\n20 22\n2 inspiral of the small body and can be connected to the orbit-averaged gravitational wave fluxes out at infinity and down the massive black hole horizon.\nThe cumulative impact of the self-force on EMRI dynamics can be further understood via a two-timescale analysis [23]. At leading adiabatic order, only the averaged first-order dissipative self-force contributes to the evolution of the orbital (and gravitational wave) phase, which accumulate like \u223c \u22121. This defines the inspiral timescale Tinsp \u223c M \u22121. At subleading post-1 adiabatic order, the oscillatory pieces of the first-order dissipative self-force and conservative self-force induce small shifts in the orbital parameters, which vary on the orbital timescale Torb \u223c M . Additionally, the accumulation of the averaged second-order self-force contributes at this order. Altogether, the post-1 adiabatic effects produce O(1) corrections to the cumulative phase. Therefore, to generate EMRI waveforms that meet LISA\u2019s subradian phase accuracy requirement, one must calculate the averaged dissipative components of the GSF to a precision & \u22121, since their errors can grow secularly over the inspiral, while the oscillatory pieces of the GSF will have their errors suppressed by O( ) relative to the leading adiabatic order and thus only need to be computed to a few digits of precision.\nHowever, this picture is complicated for systems that pass through at least one orbital r\u03b8 resonance. Due to the presence of a new timescale Tres, resonances produce a post-1/2 adiabatic correction that impacts the phase at O( \u22121/2). In the following section we review the source of this half-order correction and how it impacts the accuracy requirements for self-force calculations."

            "text": "To better understand the impact of these transient resonances, we can describe EMRI dynamics in terms of action-angle variables, as proposed in [23]. In this multiscale action-angle framework, the fast orbital evolution of the system (over timescales Torb) is captured by the angle variables ~w = (wr, w\u03b8, w\u03c6), whose time-derivatives give us the frequencies of motion (at leading-order). The actions ~J then describe the slow-time evolution of the system over Tinsp. Orbital quantities, such as the orbital energy E, orbital angular momentum Lz, and the Carter constant Q (defined in Sec. II A), provide one suitable set of actions, leading to the equations of motion,\nw\u0307C = \u2126C(J) +O( ), J\u0307 = FJ (J,w) +O( 2), (1)\nwhere x\u0307 = dx/dt; ~J = (E,Lz, Q); J is used to represent E, Lz, or Q; and C is used to represent r, \u03b8, or \u03c6.3\n3 In other words we use J to denote a function or coefficient that is related to E or Lz or Q, while ~J is used for quantities that depend on E and Lz and Q.\nThe FJ are forcing functions that are constructed from the self-force and, at leading order, can be expressed as double Fourier expansions in the angle variables,\nFJ (J,w) \u2248 \u221e\u2211\nk=\u2212\u221e \u221e\u2211 n=\u2212\u221e fJkn(J)e \u2212i(kw\u03b8+nwr), (2)\nwhere the Fourier coefficients fJkn only depend on ~J , and the forcing functions do not explicitly depend on w\u03c6 due to the rotational Killing symmetry of Kerr spacetime. We can further separate our forcing functions into terms that only depend on the dissipative self-force, and those that only depend on the conservative, i.e., FJ = FJdiss + FJcons. Based on the symmetries of the dissipative and conservative pieces, the dissipative contributions reduce to discrete cosine series,\nFJdiss(J,w) \u2248 f J 00(J) + 2 \u221e\u2211 n=1 Re[fJ0n(J)] cos(nwr) (3)\n+ 2 \u221e\u2211 k=1 \u2211 n6=0 Re[fJkn(J)] cos(kw\u03b8 + nwr)\n+ 2 \u221e\u2211 k=1 Re[fJk0(J)] cos(kw\u03b8),\nwhile the conservative contributions reduce to discrete sine series,\nFJcons(J,w) \u2248 \u22122 \u221e\u2211 n=1 Im[fJ0n(J)] sin(nwr) (4)\n\u2212 2 \u221e\u2211 k=1 \u2211 n 6=0 Im[fJkn(J)] sin(kw\u03b8 + nwr)\n\u2212 2 \u221e\u2211 k=1 Im[fJk0(J)] sin(kw\u03b8).\nIntegrating (1) over a period Tinsp, the oscillatory pieces of the forcing functions will rapidly vary and destructively interfere with one another. Thus the leading-order adiabatic evolution is given by the averaged, nonoscillatory piece of each forcing function. Away from resonances, the only nonoscillatory terms are the zero modes from the dissipative contributions,\n\u3008J\u0307 \u3009 \u2248 \u3008FJ \u3009 \u2248 \u3008FJdiss\u3009 \u2248 f J 00(J). (5)\nHowever, as the system approaches a resonance, nonzero (k, n)-modes become stationary and contribute to the secular evolution of the system. This can be seen by expanding the angle variables around the exact moment of resonance tres, when \u2126r(tres)/\u2126\u03b8(tres) = \u2126 res r /\u2126 res \u03b8 = \u03b2r/\u03b2\u03b8 with \u03b2r, \u03b2\u03b8 \u2208 Z. Introducing the condensed notation xkn = kx\u03b8 + nxr for any arbitrary parameter x, the phase takes the expanded form\nwkn(t) = w res kn + \u2126 res kn\u2206t+\n1 2 \u2126\u0307reskn\u2206t 2 +O(\u2206t3), (6)\n3 where \u2206t = t\u2212 tres and wreskn = wkn(tres). Whenever\nn\u03b2r + k\u03b2\u03b8 = 0, (7)\n\u2126reskn = 0, and the phase becomes stationary (i.e., wkn(t) \u2248 wreskn ) as long as 12 \u2126\u0307 res kn(t \u2212 tres)2 . 1. Because \u2126\u0307reskn \u223c , this criteria is met when |t\u2212 tres| . M \u22121/2 \u223c Tres. This defines the resonant timescale. Therefore any modes that satisfy the resonant condition of (7) will contribute to the secular evolution of the system for a period Tres,\n\u3008J\u0307 \u3009 \u2248 \u3008FJ \u3009 \u2248 \u2211\nk\u03b2\u03b8+n\u03b2r=0\nfJkn(J)e \u2212iwkn(tres). (8)\nEquation (8) differs from (5) in two key ways. First, the averages depend on the initial angles or phases at resonance wreskn . Second, the averages include potential contributions from both dissipative and conservative perturbations. This poses a new problem for numerical models. Errors in the initial values of wkn or the values of Im[f J kn] are usually suppressed away from resonances, but during a resonance they can accumulate and become magnified by O( \u22121/2). The exact magnification of the errors will depend on the relative strength of the Fourier coefficients fJkn to the dominant mode f J 00. Numerically evaluating these coefficients can, therefore, provide insight into how these errors grow during a resonance.\nFlux-inspired mode-sum expressions for \u3008E\u0307\u3009, \u3008L\u0307z\u3009, and \u3008Q\u0307\u3009 provide an efficient method for determining the dissipative contributions Re[fJkn] using the asymptotic behavior of the perturbing gravitational field [17], but these results do not easily extend to conservative perturbations. While these conservative perturbations could still vanish at leading order during resonances [15], i.e., \u3008FJcons\u3009 \u2248 0, previous authors have hypothesized that they will contribute to the average rate of change of the Carter constant, \u3008Q\u0307\u3009 [24\u201326], breaking the integrability of the Hamiltonian conservative system at resonance [27]. There have been attempts to extend asymptotic modesum methods to include conservative contributions [24], but the regularization of these conservative perturbations (see Sec. II C) complicates these procedures. Instead we can calculate fJkn, and thereby the conservative and dissipative contributions to \u3008J\u0307 \u3009, if we know the values of the GSF along a resonance. However, while GSF calculations have been performed along generic orbits in Kerr spacetime, to date these GSF calculations have not been extended to r\u03b8 resonances [28]."

            "text": "In this paper we make use of a scalar toy model to evaluate how, during r\u03b8 resonances, the conservative contributions to the self-force impact the adiabatic evolution of EMRIs. Using this model, we also study how numerical errors can propagate during these resonances. For\nour scalar model we consider a scalar point charge q on a r\u03b8-resonant geodesic in Kerr spacetime. The charge experiences a geodesic scalar self-force (SSF), which is akin to the GSF. Neglecting the GSF and treating q2/(\u00b5M) as a small parameter, the scalar self-forced equations of motion take the same perturbative form as (1), but with replaced by q/M . Much like the GSF, the SSF \u201cpushes\u201d the particle away from a geodesic as it sources the gradual evolution of the orbital parameters E, Lz, and Q. This work is an extension of previous results published by the author [29]. In [29], we presented the first numerical results of the SSF along r\u03b8-resonant geodesics. However, the systematic uncertainty in our SSF results was too large to make definitive statements about the impact of the conservative SSF on the secular evolution of our two-body system. In this work, we have built a new C++ code that is orders of magnitude faster than our previous Mathematica code and incorporates new algorithms that have greatly reduced our numerical and systematic errors, allowing us to accurately calculate \u3008E\u0307\u3009, \u3008L\u0307z\u3009, and \u3008Q\u0307\u3009 via (1) and (8).\nThe paper is organized as follows. To set notation, in Sec. II we review Kerr geodesics, the SSF, and the average rate of change of the orbital constants, \u3008E\u0307\u3009, \u3008L\u0307z\u3009, and \u3008Q\u0307\u3009. For brevity, we will collectively refer to these average rates of change simply as adiabatic or secular averages, since they grow secularly with time. Furthermore, we will use \u3008J\u0307 \u3009 to represent all three secular averages. In Sec. III, we describe the methods employed by our new C++ code for computing the SSF along r\u03b8 resonances and then calculating the resulting averaged secular evolution of the orbital quantities, \u3008J\u0307 \u3009. We highlight two new techniques used by our new code: (1) a Teukolsky solver that combines confluent Heun expansions, series of hypergeometric functions, and numerical integrators to solve the Teukolsky equation; and (2) a new application of modesum regularization that directly regularizes the Fourier harmonics that describe \u3008J\u0307 \u3009. In Sec. IV, we demonstrate, with new numerical results, that the conservative perturbations do contribute to the secular evolution of Q, breaking the integrability of the conservative scalar system at resonance [27]. We conclude with a discussion of these results in Sec. V. For this paper we use the metric signature (\u2212 + ++), the sign conventions, where applicable, of [30], and units such that c = G = 1."

(See Eq. (C23) in [29] for an explicit definition of K\u00b5\u03bd .) Projecting these Killing symmetries onto the four-velocity of the particle provides us with four constants of motion: the particle mass \u00b5, the orbital energy E = \u2212\u03be\u00b5(t)u\u00b5 = \u2212ut, the z-component of the orbital angular momentum Lz = \u03be \u00b5 (\u03c6)u\u00b5 = u\u03c6, and the (scaled) Carter constant Q = K\u00b5\u03bdu\u00b5u\u03bd \u2212 (Lz \u2212 aE)2 = K \u2212 (Lz \u2212 aE)2 [32].\nWith these conserved quantities, we obtain four firstorder ordinary differential equations (ODEs) for x\u00b5p , which decouple when parametrized in terms of the Mino(Carter) time parameter \u03bb [21, 32],\ndtp d\u03bb = Vtr(rp) + Vt\u03b8(\u03b8p), (10) drp d\u03bb = \u00b1 \u221a Vr(rp), (11) d\u03b8p d\u03bb = \u00b1 \u221a V\u03b8(\u03b8p), (12) d\u03c6p d\u03bb = V\u03c6r(rp) + V\u03c6\u03b8(\u03b8p).

(20)\nOn the other hand, coordinate time tp and the azimuthal angle of the particle \u03c6p not only oscillate with respect to the radial and polar frequencies, but they also accumulate with rates\n\u03a5t = \u03a5 (r) t + \u03a5 (\u03b8) t , \u03a5\u03c6 = \u03a5 (r) \u03c6 + \u03a5 (\u03b8) \u03c6 , (21)\nwhere\n\u03a5 (r) t =\n1\n\u039br \u222b \u039br 0 Vtr(rp)d\u03bb, \u03a5 (\u03b8) t = 1 \u039b\u03b8 \u222b \u039b\u03b8 0 Vt\u03b8(\u03b8p)d\u03bb,\n(22)\n\u03a5 (r) \u03c6 =\n1\n\u039br \u222b \u039br 0 V\u03c6r(rp)d\u03bb, \u03a5 (\u03b8) \u03c6 = 1 \u039b\u03b8 \u222b \u039b\u03b8 0 V\u03c6\u03b8(\u03b8p)d\u03bb.\n(23)\nWe represent their evolution as\ntp(\u03bb) = \u03a5t\u03bb+ \u2206t (r)(\u03a5r\u03bb) + \u2206t (\u03b8)(\u03a5\u03b8\u03bb), (24)\n\u03c6p(\u03bb) = \u03a5\u03c6\u03bb+ \u2206\u03c6 (r)(\u03a5r\u03bb) + \u2206\u03c6 (\u03b8)(\u03a5\u03b8\u03bb), (25)\n5 where \u2206t(r), \u2206r(r), and \u2206\u03c6(r) all share the same periodic structure, and likewise for \u2206t(\u03b8), \u2206\u03b8(\u03b8), and \u2206\u03c6(\u03b8).\nThe exact form of the oscillatory terms in (19), (20), (24), and (25) depends on the initial conditions of the bound geodesic. However, it is possible to relate geodesics that share the same orbital constants, but different initial conditions. To do so we first define a fiducial geodesic x\u0302\u00b5(\u03bb) with initial conditions (at \u03bb = 0)\nx\u0302\u00b5p (0) = (t\u0302p(0), r\u0302p(0), \u03b8\u0302p(0), \u03c6\u0302p(0)) = (0, rmin, \u03b8min, 0)\nu\u0302r(0) = u\u0302\u03b8(0) = 0. (26)\nThen any geodesic with arbitrary initial conditions\nx\u00b5p (0) = (tp(0), rp(0), \u03b8p(0), \u03c6p(0)) = (t0, r0, \u03b80, \u03c60)\nur(0) = ur0, u \u03b8(0) = u\u03b80. (27)\ncan be expressed in terms of the fiducial solutions,\ntp(\u03bb) = \u03a5t\u03bb+ \u2206t\u0302 (r)(qr + qr0)\u2212\u2206t\u0302(r)(qr0) (28)\n+ \u2206t\u0302(\u03b8)(q\u03b8 + q\u03b80)\u2212\u2206t\u0302(\u03b8)(q\u03b80) + t0, rp(\u03bb) = \u2206r\u0302 (r)(qr + qr0), (29)\n\u03b8p(\u03bb) = \u2206\u03b8\u0302 (\u03b8)(q\u03b8 + q\u03b80), (30)\n\u03c6p(\u03bb) = \u03a5\u03c6\u03bb+ \u2206\u03c6\u0302 (r)(qr + qr0)\u2212\u2206\u03c6\u0302(r)(qr0) (31)\n+ \u2206\u03c6\u0302(\u03b8)(q\u03b8 + q\u03b80)\u2212\u2206\u03c6\u0302(\u03b8)(q\u03b80) + \u03c60,\nwhere we have defined the phase variables qr = \u03a5r\u03bb and q\u03b8 = \u03a5\u03b8\u03bb.\n4 The initial phases qr0 and q\u03b80 are set by the initial conditions (r0, u r 0) and (\u03b80, u \u03b8 0), respectively, and all hatted quantities are constructed assuming the fiducial conditions of (26).\nTogether the Mino time frequencies also define the fundamental frequencies of the bound geodesic with respect to coordinate time,\n\u2126r = \u03a5r \u03a5t\n\u2126\u03b8 = \u03a5\u03b8 \u03a5t\n\u2126\u03c6 = \u03a5\u03c6 \u03a5t . (32)\nWhen at least two of these frequencies are commensurate, the geodesic is said to be resonant. In this work, we are interested in r\u03b8 resonances, where \u2126r/\u2126\u03b8 = \u03b2r/\u03b2\u03b8 with \u03b2r, \u03b2\u03b8 \u2208 Z. For r\u03b8 resonances, we define the resonant Mino frequency, resonant Mino period, and resonant fundamental frequency\n\u03a5 = \u03a5r \u03b2r = \u03a5\u03b8 \u03b2\u03b8 , \u039b = 2\u03c0 \u03a5 , \u2126 = \u03a5 \u03a5t , (33)\nrespectively. An important feature of nonresonant geodesics is that they are ergodic or space-filling. Given an infinite amount\n4 The phase variables qr and q\u03b8 are equivalent to the geodesic limit ( \u2192 0) of the angle variables wr and w\u03b8 introduced in Sec. I if we had parametrized our equations in terms of \u03bb instead of t.\nof Mino time, a nonresonant orbit will uniformly sample every point on the two-torus spanned by the phase variables qr and q\u03b8. In practice, this means that any nonresonant geodesic is directly related to a fiducial geodesic up to some trivial translation in time and azimuth. To change the initial conditions, we can simply pick new values of t0 and \u03c60. Due to the Killing symmetries of Kerr, time and azimuthal translations do not impact quantities such as the SSF or the secular rate of change of the orbital quantities, e.g., \u3008E\u0307\u3009. Therefore, we can choose fiducial initial conditions when we model nonresonant geodesics without loss of generality.\nIn contrast, resonant geodesics are not ergodic but follow restricted tracks through coordinate space (and on the qr-q\u03b8 two-torus). Furthermore, different choices of initial conditions qr0 and q\u03b80 can also lead to unique trajectories (e.g., Fig. 2 in [29]). Unlike nonresonant geodesics, r\u03b8 resonances will only map to fiducial geodesics if they simultaneously pass through rmin and \u03b8min. This only occurs if the condition\nq\u03b80 \u03b2\u03b8 \u2212 qr0 \u03b2r = 2\u03c0N (34)\nis satisfied for some integer N . Generally (34) is not met. Nevertheless, two r\u03b8 resonances can be mapped onto one another provided they share the same initial resonant phase (modulo 2\u03c0)\nq0 = q\u03b80 \u03b2\u03b8 \u2212 qr0 \u03b2r , (35)\nand the same orbital parameters (e.g., E, Lz, and Q). Therefore, when constructing the SSF or \u3008Q\u0307\u3009 (see Secs. II C and II D), we must take into account their dependence on the initial phases. In practice, due to the interdependence of qr0 and q\u03b80 in (35), we set qr0 = 0 and parametrize our initial conditions in terms of q\u03b80, without loss of generality, when dealing with r\u03b8 resonances."

The charge sources a scalar field \u03a6 (per unit charge q) that satisfies the Klein-Gordon equation\nqg\u00b5\u03bd\u2207\u00b5\u2207\u03bd\u03a6(x) = \u22124\u03c0\u03c1(x), (36)\nwhere \u03c1 is the scalar charge density,\n\u03c1(x) = q \u03b4(r \u2212 rp)\u03b4(cos \u03b8 \u2212 cos \u03b8p)\u03b4(\u03c6\u2212 \u03c6p)\nVtr(r) + Vt\u03b8(\u03b8) . (37)\nTransforming to the frequency domain, we can solve (36) via separation of variables [32, 35, 36]. We then obtain the physical retarded solution \u03a6ret by imposing causal boundary conditions at the black hole horizon r+ = M + \u221a M2 \u2212 a2 and infinity. When \u03a6ret is reconstructed back into the time-domain, the only frequencies\n6 that contribute are those that correspond to the discrete frequency spectrum of the charge\u2019s bound motion,\n\u03c9mkn = m\u2126\u03c6 + k\u2126\u03b8 + n\u2126r. (38)\nAs a result, the scalar field can be expressed as a discrete mode-sum,\n\u03a6ret(x) = \u2211 jmkn Rretjmkn(r)Sjmkn(\u03b8)e im\u03c6e\u2212i\u03c9mknt, (39)\nwhere we have introduced the compact notation,\n\u2211 jmkn = \u221e\u2211 j=0 j\u2211 m=\u2212j \u221e\u2211 k=\u2212\u221e \u221e\u2211 n=\u2212\u221e . (40)\nThe polar dependence in (39) is captured by the scalar spheroidal harmonics Sjmkn(\u03b8) [37, 38], which satisfy[\nd2\nd2\u03b8 \u2212 cot \u03b8 d d\u03b8 \u2212 a2\u03c92mkn sin2 \u03b8 (41)\n+ 2ma\u03c9mkn \u2212 m2\nsin2 \u03b8 + \u03bbjmkn\n] Sjmkn(\u03b8) = 0,\nwhere \u03bbjmkn is the spheroidal eigenvalue. In the limit a\u03c9mkn \u2192 0, \u03bbjmkn \u2192 l(l + 1) and (41) reduces to the spherical harmonic equation. Therefore, the Sjmkn can be expressed as rapidly convergent sums of spherical harmonics,\nSjmkn(\u03b8)e im\u03c6 = \u221e\u2211 l=0 bljmknYlm(\u03b8, \u03c6), (42)\nwhere the coupling coefficients bljmkn satisfy a three-term recursion relation [39, 40]. The radial dependence in (39) is captured by the Teukolsky solutions Rretjmkn(r), which satisfy the inhomogeneous spin-0 radial Teukolsky equation[\nd2\ndr2 +GT(r)\nd\ndr + UTjmkn(r)\n] Rjmkn(r) = Zjmkn(r),\n(43) with causal boundary conditions [36], where\nGT(r) = 2(r \u2212M)\n\u2206 , (44)\nUTjmkn(r) = [(r2 + a2)\u03c9mkn \u2212ma]2 \u22062 \u2212 \u03bbjmkn \u2206 , (45)\nand Zjmkn is the radial component of the modedecomposed source, \u03c1, given in (37). The causal boundary conditions are captured by the unit-normalized ingoing and upgoing homogeneous solutions, which have the respective asymptotic behaviors,\nR\u2212jmkn(r \u2192 r+) \u223c e \u2212ipmknr\u2217 , (46) R+jmkn(r \u2192\u221e) \u223c ei\u03c9mknr\u2217\nr , (47)\nwhere pmkn = \u03c9mkn\u2212ma/(2Mr+) is the horizon-shifted frequency, and r\u2217 is the tortoise coordinate defined by the differential relation dr\u2217/dr = (r\n2 + a2)/\u2206. While we could reconstruct \u03a6ret using (39), the resulting field exhibits Gibbs ringing in the source region rmin \u2264 r \u2264 rmax due to the pointlike distributional source in (37). Therefore, we circumvent the Gibbs phenomenon by applying the method of extended homogeneous solutions [41\u201343]. Outside the source region (r < rmin and r > rmax) R ret jmkn simply reduces to the homogeneous solutions R\u00b1jmkn multiplied by complex normalization coefficients C\u00b1jmkn,\nRretjmkn(r < rmin) = C \u2212 jmknR \u2212 jmkn(r), (48) Rretjmkn(r > rmax) = C + jmknR + jmkn(r). (49)\nThe C\u00b1jmkn, also known as Teukolsky amplitudes, are calculated using the standard method of variation of parameters, as outlined in [29, 34]. Importantly, varying the initial phases of the scalar charge\u2019s orbit will change C\u00b1jmkn by an overall phase factor [17, 44]\nC\u00b1jmkn = e i\u03bemkn(t0,qr0,q\u03b80,\u03c60)C\u0302\u00b1jmkn, (50)\nwhere the fiducial coefficients C\u0302\u00b1jmkn are calculated assuming fiducial initial conditions (26), and the phase factor \u03bemkn is given by\n\u03bemkn(t0, qr0, q\u03b80, \u03c60) =\nm(\u2206\u03c6\u0302(r)(qr0) + \u2206\u03c6\u0302 (\u03b8)(q\u03b80)\u2212 \u03c60)\u2212 kq\u03b80 (51)\n\u2212 \u03c9mkn(\u2206t\u0302(r)(qr0) + \u2206t\u0302(\u03b8)(q\u03b80)\u2212 t0)\u2212 nqr0.\nConsequently, in the vacuum regions of spacetime \u03a6ret can be reconstructed from an exponentially convergent sum over the homogeneous radial solutions R\u00b1jmkn,\n\u03a6ret(r < rmin) = \u221e\u2211 l=0 l\u2211 m=\u2212l \u03c8\u2212lm(t, r)Ylm(\u03b8, \u03c6), (52)\n= \u03a6\u2212(x), (53)\n\u03a6ret(r > rmax) = \u221e\u2211 l=0 l\u2211 m=\u2212l \u03c8+lm(t, r)Ylm(\u03b8, \u03c6), (54)\n= \u03a6+(x), (55)\nwhere we have introduced the extended homogeneous mode functions,\n\u03c8\u00b1lm(t, r) = \u221e\u2211 k=\u2212\u221e \u221e\u2211 n=\u2212\u221e \u221e\u2211 j=|m| \u03c8\u00b1ljmkn(r)e \u2212i\u03c9mknt, (56)\n\u03c8\u00b1ljmkn(r) = b l jmknC \u00b1 jmknR \u00b1 jmkn(r). (57)\nTo obtain \u03a6ret over the entire radial domain, we simply extend our homogeneous solutions into the source region, e.g.,\n\u03a6ret(t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) = \u03a6\u2212(t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6)\u0398(rp(t)\u2212 r) (58) + \u03a6+(t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6)\u0398(r \u2212 rp(t)).\n7 While \u03c8\u00b1lm(t, r) and \u03c8 \u00b1 ljmkn(r) are not formal solutions of our inhomogeneous Teukolsky wave equations, summing over all of the extended harmonic modes results in a convergent field solution that is free of Gibbs ringing and accurately represents \u03a6ret over the entire spacetime domain up to the charge\u2019s worldline x\u00b5p ."

            "text": "Now we take into account the backreaction of the scalar field on the charge q. This produces a SSF F\u03b1 (per unit charge squared) that drives the inspiral of the particle [45],\nu\u00b5\u2207\u00b5(\u00b5u\u03b1) = q2F\u03b1. (59) While the field \u03a6ret formally diverges along the charge\u2019s worldline (where the SSF is evaluated), only a regular component of the field contributes to the SSF. This regular contribution is completely captured by the DetweilerWhiting regular field \u03a6R [46],\nF\u03b1 = lim x\u2192xp g\u03b1\u03b2\u2207\u03b2\u03a6R, (60)\nthough it is often convenient to further decompose \u03a6R into its conservative and dissipative pieces, \u03a6R = \u03a6cons + \u03a6diss, resulting in conservative and dissipative contributions to the self-force,\nF cons\u03b1 = \u2207\u03b1\u03a6cons, F diss\u03b1 = \u2207\u03b1\u03a6diss, (61) respectively. The dissipative scalar perturbations are associated with the radiative field \u03a6diss = 12 (\u03a6\nret \u2212 \u03a6adv) that drives the inspiral of the scalar charge, where \u03a6adv is the advanced field solution of (36). While \u03a6ret and \u03a6adv diverge along the worldline, their singular behaviors perfectly cancel when constructing \u03a6diss, resulting in a smooth, well-defined field along the worldline. The remaining conservative scalar perturbations \u03a6cons = \u03a6R\u2212\u03a6diss only source nonsecular changes in the motion when the system is not in resonance. In this work, we investigate whether this behavior also extends to resonances.\nTo calculate these conservative perturbations, we first construct the regular field from the difference \u03a6R = \u03a6ret \u2212 \u03a6S, where \u03a6S is the Detweiler-Whiting singular field. Like \u03a6ret, \u03a6S satisfies (36), but with nonradiative boundary conditions that result in a solution that captures the local, singular behavior of the field. Therefore, \u03a6S also diverges at the location of the charge, requiring a regularization procedure that delicately handles the subtraction of \u03a6ret and \u03a6S. In this work we employ modesum regularization [47, 48], in which the divergent quantities F ret\u03b1 = \u2207\u03b1\u03a6ret and F S\u03b1 = \u2207\u03b1\u03a6S are decomposed onto a spherical harmonic basis, resulting in finite multipole moments (spherical harmonic l-modes) that can be subtracted mode by mode,\nF\u03b1 = lim x\u2192\u00b1xp \u221e\u2211 l=0 ( F ret,l\u03b1\u00b1 \u2212 F S,l \u03b1\u00b1 ) . (62)\nThe\u00b1 notation takes into account that F ret,l\u03b1 and F S,l\u03b1 are discontinuous at x\u00b5p ; therefore, their values depend on the radial direction from which we approach the worldline. While we only need to regularize F cons\u03b1 , in practice we first compute F\u03b1 via (62) and then use it to construct F cons\u03b1 and F diss \u03b1 .\nAn advantage of this mode-sum approach is that F S,l\u03b1\u00b1 can be expressed as a series of l-independent regularization parameters, which are constructed by expanding \u03a6S in the local neighborhood of x\u00b5p [46, 48, 49],\nF S,l\u03b1\u00b1 = \u00b1 1\n2 A\u03b1(2l + 1) +B\u03b1 (63)\n+ \u221e\u2211 n=1 n\u220f k=1\nD (2n) \u03b1\n(2l + 2k + 1)(2l \u2212 2k + 1) .\nThe higher-order parameters, D (2n) \u03b1 , are not strictly needed for convergence. They vanish when summed over all l-modes,\n\u221e\u2211 l=0 n\u220f k=1\nD (2n) \u03b1\n(2l + 2k + 1)(2l \u2212 2k + 1) = 0, (64)\nbut each additional D (2n) \u03b1 that we incorporate in our mode-sum regularization increases the rate at which the sum in (62) converges. Including parameters up to n = nmax results in (62) converging like l\n\u22122(nmax+1). This is particularly useful in our numerical calculations, where we are forced to truncate the sum at some finite l = lmax. In this work, we make use of A\u03b1, B\u03b1, and D (2) \u03b1 , which were analytically derived by Heffernan [50] and are available on Zenodo [51].\nUsing our results from Sec. II B, it is straightforward to construct the time, radial, and azimuthal components of F ret,l\u03b1\u00b1 ,\nF ret,lt\u00b1 = l\u2211 m=\u2212l F ret,lmt\u00b1 = l\u2211 m=\u2212l \u2202t\u03c8 \u00b1 lm(t, r)Ylm(\u03b8, \u03c6), (65)\nF ret,lr\u00b1 = l\u2211 m=\u2212l F ret,lmr\u00b1 = l\u2211 m=\u2212l \u2202r\u03c8 \u00b1 lm(t, r)Ylm(\u03b8, \u03c6), (66)\nF ret,l\u03c6\u00b1 = l\u2211 m=\u2212l F ret,lm\u03c6\u00b1 = l\u2211 m=\u2212l im\u03c8\u00b1lm(t, r)Ylm(\u03b8, \u03c6).\n(67)\nAssembling the polar component is more complicated. Taking the polar derivative of (52)-(58) results in a series of spherical harmonic derivatives,\nF ret,l\u03b8\u00b1 = l\u2211 m=\u2212l \u03c8\u00b1lm(t, r)\u2202\u03b8Ylm(\u03b8, \u03c6), (68)\ninstead of the spherical harmonic basis needed for our regularization scheme. Unfortunately, simply reexpanding (68) onto a basis of spherical harmonics is computationally impractical due to the strong coupling between \u2202\u03b8Ylm and Ylm [43].\n8 To circumvent this issue, we follow the methods of [43] and multiply \u03a6ret by a suitable window function f(x) so that the combination f\u2202\u03b8Ylm can be reexpressed as a finite series of spherical harmonics. If the windowed, unregularized self-force field,\nF\u0303 ret\u03b8 (x) = \u2207\u03b8 [ f(x)\u03a6ret(x) ] = f(x)\u2202\u03b8\u03a6 ret(x) + \u03a6ret(x)\u2202\u03b8f(x), (69)\nreduces to F ret\u03b8 (x) as we approach the worldline (i.e., F\u0303 ret\u03b8 \u2192 F ret\u03b8 as x\u00b5 \u2192 x\u00b5p ), then we can calculate F\u03b8 via the mode-sum regularization of F\u0303 ret\u03b8 (x), 5\nF\u03b8 = lim x\u2192\u00b1xp \u221e\u2211 l=0 ( F\u0303 ret,l\u03b8\u00b1 \u2212 B\u0303\u03b8 \u2212\nD\u0303 (2) \u03b8\n(2l \u2212 1)(2l + 3)\n) . (70)\nwhere we have made use of the fact that A\u0303\u03b8 = A\u0303\u03c6 = 0 along all geodesics in Kerr spacetime. For a general choice of f(x), the new regularization parameters B\u0303\u03b8 and D\u0303 (2) \u03b8 will differ from the original analytically known parameters B\u03b8 and D (2) \u03b8 , because our window function will also change the structure of the singular field. To ensure that B\u0303\u03b8 = B\u03b8 and D\u0303 (2) \u03b8 = D (2) \u03b8 , we must choose f(x) so that the singular structure of \u03a6S is preserved at its first few leading orders. (See Appendix A for more details.) This is achieved if f(cos \u03b8) = 1 +O(cos \u03b8 \u2212 cos \u03b8p)4.\nTherefore, we introduce the window function\nf(\u03b8, \u03b8p) = 3\u2211 j=0 \u03b1j(\u03b8p) cos j \u03b8 sin \u03b8, (71)\nwhere\n\u03b10(\u03b8p) = 2\u2212 7 cos2 \u03b8p + 8 cos4 \u03b8p(1\u2212 cos2 \u03b8p)\n2 sin7 \u03b8p , (72)\n\u03b11(\u03b8p) = 3 cos3 \u03b8p(1 + 4 cos 2 \u03b8p)\n2 sin7 \u03b8p , (73)\n\u03b12(\u03b8p) = 1\u2212 8 cos2 \u03b8p(1 + cos2 \u03b8p)\n2 sin7 \u03b8p , (74)\n\u03b13(\u03b8p) = cos \u03b8p(3 + 2 cos\n2 \u03b8p)\n2 sin7 \u03b8p . (75)\nWith this window function, we get a finite coupling between the spherical harmonics and their derivatives,\nf(\u03b8, \u03b8p)\u2202\u03b8Ylm(\u03b8, \u03c6) = 4\u2211 n=\u22124 \u03b2 (n) lm (\u03b8p)Yl+n,m(\u03b8, \u03c6), (76)\n5 Alternatively, we can think of this window function method as a process for choosing a different extension of the self-force operator away from the particle\u2019s worldline, i.e., \u2207\u03b1 \u2192 f(x)\u2207\u03b1, as done in [28].\nwhere \u03b2 (n) lm is defined in Appendix A. As a result,\nF\u0303 ret,l\u03b8\u00b1 = l\u2211 m=\u2212l F ret,lm\u03b8\u00b1 (77)\n= l\u2211 m=\u2212l 4\u2211 n=\u22124 \u03b2 (\u2212n) l+n,m(\u03b8p)\u03c8 \u00b1 l+n,m(t, r)Ylm(\u03b8, \u03c6),\nwhich is amenable to mode-sum regularization. The final step before mode-sum regularizing the SSF is to construct the retarded self-force multipole contributions along the worldline of our point charge. To do so, we follow the methods outlined in [29]. First, we assume that our point charge is following a fiducial resonant geodesic x\u0302\u00b5p given by (28)-(31) with t0 = qr0 = q\u03b80 = \u03c60 = 0. We then construct F ret,l\u03b1\u00b1 via (65)-(67) and (77) and evaluate both F ret,l\u03b1\u00b1 and F S,l \u03b1\u00b1 along x\u0302 \u00b5 p , e.g.,\nF ret,l\u03b1\u00b1 (t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6)\u2192 F ret,l \u03b1\u00b1 (t\u0302p(\u03bb), r\u0302p(\u03bb), \u03b8\u0302p(\u03bb), \u03c6\u0302p(\u03bb)).\nWhen evaluating the mode functions along the worldline, the terms that accumulate linearly with \u03bb cancel, allowing us to instead parametrize F ret,l\u03b1\u00b1 , F S,l \u03b1\u00b1, and F\u03b1 in terms of the phase variables qr and q\u03b8 [28, 29]. Therefore, in a slight abuse of notation, we use F\u0302 ret,l\u03b1\u00b1 (qr, q\u03b8), F\u0302 S,l \u03b1\u00b1(qr, q\u03b8), and F\u0302\u03b1(qr, q\u03b8) to denote the retarded self-force multipole contributions, the singular self-force multipole contributions, and the regularized SSF evaluated along a fiducial geodesic, respectively.\nTo assemble the dissipative and conservative contributions to the self-force, we leverage the symmetries of Kerr spacetime to relate F\u0302 diss\u03b1 and F\u0302 cons \u03b1 to F\u0302\u03b1 [23, 29],\nF\u0302 diss\u03b1 (qr, q\u03b8) = 1\n2\n[ F\u0302\u03b1(qr, q\u03b8)\u2212 (\u03b1)F\u0302\u03b1(2\u03c0 \u2212 qr, 2\u03c0 \u2212 q\u03b8) ] ,\nF\u0302 cons\u03b1 (qr, q\u03b8) = 1\n2\n[ F\u0302\u03b1(qr, q\u03b8) + (\u03b1)F\u0302\u03b1(2\u03c0 \u2212 qr, 2\u03c0 \u2212 q\u03b8) ] ,\n(78)\nwhere (\u03b1) . = (\u22121, 1, 1,\u22121).\nUsing these fiducial self-force quantities, we can also evaluate the SSF for a resonant geodesic with nonfiducial initial conditions qr0 6= 0 and q\u03b80 6= 0 via the shifting relation [29],\nF\u03b1(qr, q\u03b8; qr0, q\u03b80) = F\u0302\u03b1(qr + qr0, q\u03b8 + q\u03b80). (79)\nThe shifting relation holds for F ret,l\u03b1\u00b1 (qr, q\u03b8; qr0, q\u03b80) and F S,l\u03b1\u00b1(qr, q\u03b8; qr0, q\u03b80), as well. Therefore, by computing the fiducial SSF quantities along a two-dimensional grid spanned by qr and q\u03b8, we efficiently capture the evolution of the SSF along a whole family of resonant geodesics that share the same orbital constants and frequencies, but differ in their initial conditions.\nD. Secular evolution of E, Lz, and Q\nOnce we determine the SSF, we examine its impact on the evolution of the charge. First, we reexpress the\n9 equations of motion (59) in terms of \u00b5, E, Lz, and Q,\nd\u00b5 d\u03c4 = \u2212q2u\u03b1F\u03b1, (80)\ndE d\u03c4 = \u2212q2at,\ndLz d\u03c4 = q2a\u03c6, (81)\ndQ d\u03c4 = 2q2K\u00b5\u03bdu\u00b5a\u03bd \u2212 2q2(Lz \u2212 aE) (a\u03c6 + aat) , (82)\nwhere a\u00b5 is the self-acceleration of the scalar charge,\n\u00b5a\u00b5 = (g\u00b5\u03bd + u\u00b5u\u03bd)F\u03bd = F \u00b5 \u2212 u\n\u00b5\nq2 d\u00b5 d\u03c4 . (83)\nThe leading-order, adiabatic evolution of our system is captured by the secular rate of change of these orbital quantities, \u3008\u00b5\u0307\u3009, \u3008E\u0307\u3009, \u3008L\u0307z\u3009, and \u3008Q\u0307\u3009. The brackets denote an orbit-average with respect to coordinate time,\n\u3008X\u3009 = 1 T \u222b T 0 X(t)dt, (84)\nwhere T is the orbital period. We can integrate (80) analytically,6 leading to the trivial result \u3008\u00b5\u0307\u3009 = 0. Following [52], we reexpress the remaining orbit-averages as integrals over Mino time. Therefore, for a scalar charge q on a r\u03b8-resonant geodesic with initial orbital phase q\u03b80,\n7 the secular evolution due to the SSF is given by\n\u3008J\u0307 \u3009 = q 2\n\u00b5\u039b\u03a5t \u222b \u039b 0 I\u0302J (\u03a5r\u03bb,\u03a5\u03b8\u03bb+ q\u03b80)d\u03bb, (85)\nwhere J is used to represent E, Lz, or Q, and the integrands are given by\nI\u0302E = \u2212\u03a3\u0302pa\u0302t, I\u0302Lz = \u03a3\u0302pa\u0302\u03c6, (86)\nI\u0302Q = 2\u03a3\u0302p [ K\u0302\u00b5\u03bd u\u0302\u00b5a\u0302\u03bd \u2212 (Lz \u2212 aE) (a\u0302\u03c6 + aa\u0302t) ] . (87)\nNote that all hatted quantities are evaluated along a fiducial geodesic that shares the same frequencies as the scalar charge\u2019s orbit.\nAs discussed in Sec. I, the averages in (85) will vary with the choice of initial phase q\u03b80. This is in contrast to nonresonant orbits, which have no phase dependence. Therefore, we define the double average\n\u3008\u3008J\u0307 \u3009\u30090 = 1\n2\u03c0\u039b \u222b 2\u03c0 0 \u222b \u039b 0 J\u0307 (\u03bb; q\u03b80)d\u03bb dq\u03b80 (88)\nto capture the piece of the secular evolution that is independent of q\u03b80. Computing this double average is equivalent to computing \u3008J\u0307 \u3009 by naively assuming that our\n6 The evolution of the mass is given by \u00b5(t) = \u00b50 \u2212 q\u03a6R[x\u00b5p (t)], where \u00b50 is an integration constant commonly referred to as the charge\u2019s bare mass. 7 Recall from Sec. II A that, due to the coupling between the radial and polar motion, we can set qr0 = 0 without loss of generality, provided we allow q\u03b80 to be nonzero.\nresonant geodesics are nonresonant. The phase dependence of our resonant averages is then captured by the residual averages,\n\u3008\u03b4J\u0307 \u3009 = \u3008J\u0307 \u3009 \u2212 \u3008\u3008J\u0307 \u3009\u30090. (89)\nTo compute these averages, we first take into account that our orbit averages in (85) will depend on both F diss\u03b1 and F cons\u03b1 . Therefore, any quantity that depends on the self-force can be decomposed into a conservative contribution and a dissipative contribution, e.g.,\n\u3008\u03b4Q\u0307\u3009 = \u3008\u03b4Q\u0307\u3009diss + \u3008\u03b4Q\u0307\u3009cons. (90)\nHenceforth, quantities with a \u201ccons\u201d label are calculated using only F cons\u03b1 , while any quantity with a \u201cdiss\u201d label is calculated using only F diss\u03b1 . Furthermore, we can decompose quantities into their contributions from both F ret,l\u03b1\u00b1 and F S,l \u03b1\u00b1, e.g.,\n\u3008\u03b4Q\u0307\u3009cons = [ \u221e\u2211 l=0 ( \u3008\u03b4Q\u0307\u3009ret,l\u00b1 \u2212 \u3008\u03b4Q\u0307\u3009 S,l \u00b1 )] \u2212 \u3008\u03b4Q\u0307\u3009diss. (91)\nThese decompositions allow us to effectively mode-sum regularize the secular quantities themselves, rather than regularizing the self-force and then computing the averaged rates of change. For example, we find that regularizing \u3008\u03b4Q\u0307\u3009cons significantly reduces systematic uncertainties in our final results, as we will discuss in Sec. III.\nBased on the symmetries of the conservative perturbations [see (78)] and global flux-balance arguments [21, 53, 54], \u3008E\u0307\u3009cons = \u3008L\u0307z\u3009cons = \u3008\u3008Q\u0307\u3009\u3009cons0 = 0. This is in agreement with nonresonant orbits, where conservative perturbations have no impact on the leading-order secular evolution. However, as discussed in [24\u201326], during r\u03b8 resonances these same symmetry and flux-balance arguments no longer guarantee that \u3008\u03b4Q\u0307\u3009cons will vanish. Therefore, we compute \u3008\u03b4Q\u0307\u3009cons for a scalar charge on several different r\u03b8-resonant orbits."

            "heading": "III. NUMERICAL METHODS AND IMPLEMENTATION",
            "text": "To carry out our calculations we developed a new numerical code in C++, which we will refer to as CPP. CPP consists of a driver program that calculates, for a scalar charge following a resonant geodesic, the average rate of change of its orbital energy, angular momentum, and Carter constant\u2014\u3008E\u0307\u3009, \u3008L\u0307z\u3009, and \u3008Q\u0307\u3009\u2014due to the SSF. The driver program calls on eight separate modules, each of which implements a different piece of the self-force problem outlined in Sec. II:\n1. a geodesic module that determines the background motion of a perturbing particle,\n2. a harmonic module that evaluates the frequencydomain harmonics of the self-force experienced by a perturbing particle,\n10\n3. a spheroidal harmonic module that solves for the spheroidal harmonics,\n4. a radial Teukolsky module that solves for the homogeneous radial Teukolsky solutions,\n5. a source integration module that calculates the normalization constants (Teukolsky amplitudes) due to the presence of a perturbing point-source,\n6. a self-force module that sums over the harmonics to construct unregularized modes of the self-force,\n7. a secular evolution module that determines the averaged rate of change of the background orbital quantities due to a perturbing force, and\n8. a regularization module that regularizes divergent self-force data.\nOne advantage of writing this new code is that CPP, which only relies on floating-point arithmetic at double precision, is much faster and less memory-intensive than our old arbitrary-precision Mathematica code, which we used in previous investigations of the SSF [29, 34]. From here on, we refer to the Mathematica code as MMA. With CPP, a typical SSF calculation (for a single resonance with all initial conditions taken into account) completes in \u223c 300 CPU hours on a laptop with a 2.4 GHz 8-core Intel Core i9 processor. As a result, SSF calculations complete in less than a day when mode computations are distributed across the laptop\u2019s cores with MPI [55]. For comparison, comparable SSF calculations took over 15,000 CPU hours with MMA, and had to be performed in parallel on a cluster for several weeks. Another benefit of CPP is that is relies on freely available, open-access software\u2014such as GSL [56, 57] and Boost [58]\u2014making it far more accessible than MMA, which relies on proprietary software.\nAnother advantage is that, due to its modular design, CPP can easily be generalized to the problem of calculating the GSF in radiation gauges. In fact, our spheroidal harmonic, radial Teukolsky, and source integration modules have already been generalized to handle gravitational perturbations. However, for the purposes of this work, we will only focus on the numerical implementation of the SSF problem. In Sec. III A we describe the CPP driver program and how it generates the results presented in Sec. IV, while detailed descriptions of the CPP modules are found in Appendix B.\nCPP implements many of the same numerical methods used by MMA and outlined in [29, 34], but we highlight two key differences between these two codes. The first is that in MMA we determine the radial Teukolsky solutions using semianalytic series of hypergeometric functions derived by Mano, Suzuki, and Takasugi (MST) [59, 60] that are evaluated at high levels of precision. In contrast, CPP computes the radial Teukolsky solutions using a combination of routines that are better adapted to the limits of double precision, including adaptive stepsize numerical integration, asymptotic expansions, and\nthe MST series. (See B 5.) This required the development of a special functions C++ library that computes a number of functions in the complex domain, particularly hypergeometric functions.\nThe second key difference is that in MMA we first regularize the SSF, and then we use the regularized data F\u03b1 to compute \u3008E\u0307\u3009, \u3008L\u0307z\u3009, \u3008Q\u0307\u3009 as functions of the initial resonant phase q\u03b80. Therefore, uncertainties and errors introduced to F\u03b1 by our MMA regularization procedure are propagated to \u3008E\u0307\u3009, \u3008L\u0307z\u3009, \u3008Q\u0307\u3009. In CPP we first calculate the mode contributions to the secular rates of change using the unregularized SSF modes F\u0302 ret,l\u03b1\u00b1 , and then we regularize the coefficients of the Fourier series that represent our orbit-averaged quantities. (See B 7 and B 8.) Directly regularizing the Fourier coefficients of \u3008E\u0307\u3009, \u3008L\u0307z\u3009, \u3008Q\u0307\u3009 significantly reduces estimated uncertainties due to mode-sum regularization. We expand on this new regularization scheme in Sec. III A."

Consequently, F\u0302 ret\u2212A,l\u03b1+,jrj\u03b8 tends to accumulate larger numerical errors when the scalar charge is closer to rmin, while F\u0302 ret\u2212A,l\u03b1\u2212,jrj\u03b8 suffers from larger numerical errors when the charge is closer to rmax.

Once again, the driver program first uses the secular evolution module to calculate the l-mode contributions to F\u0303J ,consk using the SSF data F\u0302 cons+S\u2212A,l \u03b1\u00b1 and F\u0302 cons+S\u2212A,l\u03b1\u2276 .

However, unlike the dissipative case, naively summing over F\u0303J ,cons+S\u2212Ak,l leads to a divergent result and, thus, these coefficients need to be regularized. (See Figs. 2 and 3.) Much like the SSF itself, these Fourier coefficients are amenable to mode-sum regularization. Therefore, the program uses the secular evolution module to generate Fourier coefficient regularization parameters, F\u0303J ,Bk and F\u0303 J ,D k , by replacing SSF data with the regularization parameters B\u0302\u03b1 and D\u0302 (2) \u03b1 as input.\nThe program then submits F\u0303J ,cons+S\u2212Ak,l\u00b1 , F\u0303 J ,cons+S\u2212A k,l\u2276 , F\u0303J ,Bk , and F\u0303 J ,D k to the regularization module described in Appendix B 8.

            "text": "We use the CPP code outlined in Sec. III to calculate the average rate of change of E, Lz, and Q due to the SSF for the resonant orbits listed in Table I. From here on we use J to denote E, Lz, or Q. In Sec. IV A we verify the accuracy of our dissipative averages, \u3008J\u0307 \u3009diss, by analyzing their convergence and comparing them to the asymptotic behavior of the scalar field. Then in Sec. IV B we validate the conservative averages, \u3008\u03b4J\u0307 \u3009cons, by analyzing their convergence from mode-sum regularization and verifying that \u3008\u03b4E\u0307\u3009cons and \u3008\u03b4L\u0307z\u3009cons vanish as we expect from flux-balance arguments. After validating our new methods and code, we demonstrate in Sec. IV C that \u3008\u03b4Q\u0307\u3009cons does not vanish for the resonances considered in this work. Furthermore we estimate the error that is introduced to the leading-order evolution if we neglect these conservative contributions. To simplify notation, we set M = q = 1 for the remainder of this section.\n13\nA. Validation tests: Dissipative perturbations\nFirst we verify that the coefficients F\u0303J ,dissk,l converge exponentially with l. We find that the k = 0 and k = 2 modes consistently exhibit exponential convergence for each orbit in Table I, while higher-order k-modes are dominated by numerical noise at larger values of l. To illustrate this behavior, in Fig. 1 we plot the magnitude of F\u0303J ,dissk,l for the e02.23 orbit in Table I. The error bars represent the estimated uncertainty in each coefficient. Note that we do not include any odd k-modes, because they vanish due to the symmetries of Kerr spacetime. We see that the higher modes possess large uncertainties and do not exponentially decay but instead vary around \u223c 10\u221214. Ultimately, this behavior is consistent with the numerical accuracy of our SSF results, which we expect to be accurate down to \u223c 10\u221213 based on our code\u2019s mode-sum convergence criteria outlined in Appendix B 2. Furthermore, we see that the mode content of the dissipative averages is largely captured by the k = 0 and k = 2 Fourier modes, while the higher modes are suppressed by several orders of magnitude. Therefore, our numerical errors in the higher modes do not have a significant impact on our calculations of \u3008J\u0307 \u3009diss.\nNext, we validate our calculations of \u3008J\u0307 \u3009diss using a standard flux-balance comparison [21, 53, 54]. Due to global conservation laws, the average rate of change of E and Lz\u2014which we can interpret as the local work and torque performed on our charge by the SSF\u2014must be balanced by the flux of energy and angular momentum radiated by the scalar field at infinity, \u3008E\u0307\u3009\u221erad and \u3008L\u0307z\u3009\u221erad, and the horizon, \u3008E\u0307\u3009Hrad and \u3008L\u0307z\u3009Hrad,\n\u3008E\u0307\u3009 = \u2212 ( \u3008E\u0307\u3009Hrad + \u3008E\u0307\u3009\u221erad ) = \u2212\u3008E\u0307\u3009rad, (104)\n\u3008L\u0307z\u3009 = \u2212 ( \u3008L\u0307z\u3009Hrad + \u3008L\u0307z\u3009\u221erad ) = \u2212\u3008L\u0307z\u3009rad. (105)\nWhile a flux-balance law does not exist for the Carter constant, we can still relate \u3008Q\u0307\u3009diss to the asymptotic behavior of the scalar field at the horizon and infinity [17, 24, 44, 62], which we refer to as \u3008Q\u0307\u3009Hrad and \u3008Q\u0307\u3009\u221erad,9 leading to a similar condition\n\u3008Q\u0307\u3009 = \u2212 ( \u3008Q\u0307\u3009Hrad + \u3008Q\u0307\u3009\u221erad ) = \u2212\u3008Q\u0307\u3009rad, (106)\nFor a scalar charge on a resonant orbit, these radiative averages reduce to\n\u3008J\u0307 \u3009H/\u221erad = 1\n4\u03c0 \u221e\u2211 j=0 j\u2211 m=\u2212j \u221e\u2211 N=\u2212\u221e \u3008J\u0307 \u3009H/\u221ejmN , (107)\n\u3008J\u0307 \u3009HjmN = \u2211\n(k,n)N \u2211 (k\u2032,n\u2032)N AJmknpmk\u2032n\u2032$ 2 +C \u2212 jmknC\u0304 \u2212 jmk\u2032n\u2032 ,\n\u3008J\u0307 \u3009\u221ejmN = \u2211\n(k,n)N \u2211 (k\u2032,n\u2032)N AJmkn\u03c9mk\u2032n\u2032C + jmknC\u0304 + jmk\u2032n\u2032 ,\nwhere $2+ = r 2 + + a 2, an overbar denotes complex conjugation, and \u2211 (k,n)N refers to a sum over all integer k and n values that satisfy k\u03b2\u03b8+n\u03b2r = N .

The calculation of their Fourier coefficients, which we denote as F\u0303J ,radk , is described in Appendix F.\n9 Despite the suggestive naming, we emphasize that \u3008Q\u0307\u3009Hrad and \u3008Q\u0307\u3009\u221erad are not fluxes.\n14\nk , the Fourier coefficients of the asymptotic averages given in (107). Note that\nThus, we calculate \u3008J\u0307 \u3009rad and the corresponding Fourier coefficients F\u0303J ,radk for the resonances listed in Table I. We then compare these coefficients to F\u0303J ,dissk via (104)-(106). In Tables II and III, we report the values of F\u0303J ,dissk and the absolute error between F\u0303 J ,diss k and F\u0303J ,radk for each resonance. We report all k-modes that our code uses when evaluating \u3008J\u0307 \u3009diss. Interestingly, there are instances where our code includes modes in which the magnitude of F\u0303J ,dissk is less than its uncertainty. While the values of these individual modes are highly uncertain, our code still incorporates these modes because they improve our overall uncertainty estimate for \u3008J\u0307 \u3009diss. From Table II, we see that the absolute errors always fall under the estimated uncertainty of our results, demonstrating that our coefficients are not only accurate, but that our estimated uncertainties account for the dominant sources of numerical error in our dissipative data.\nB. Validation tests: Conservative perturbations\nTo validate the conservative averages calculated by our new code, we test the l-mode convergence of the Fourier coefficients F\u0303J ,consk that describe \u3008J\u0307 \u3009cons. Mode-sum regularization of the conservative perturbations leads to the algebraic convergence of F\u0303J ,consk,l with l. As we in-\nclude the A\u03b1, B\u03b1, and D (2) \u03b1 parameters in our modesum regularization, we expect the regularized values of F\u0303J ,consk,l to fall-off like l0, l\u22122 and l\u22124, respectively. The rates of convergence are demonstrated in Figs. 2 and 3, where we plot |F\u0303Q,cons+S\u2212Ak,l | (red circles), |F\u0303 Q,cons+S\u2212A k,l \u2212 F\u0303Q,Bk,l | (blue triangles), and |F\u0303 Q,cons+S\u2212A k,l \u2212 F\u0303 Q,B k,l \u2212 F\u0303Q,Dk,l /(2l \u2212 1)/(2l + 3)| (orange diamonds). Figure 2 plots the coefficients for the e02.23 resonance, while Fig. 3 plots the coefficients for e05.23. The error bars display the estimated uncertainty in each coefficient. Note that this estimated uncertainty only takes into account errors due to truncating our (formally infinite) self-force modesums, not the errors due to catastrophic cancellations when evaluating the sums. We find that, much like the dissipative coefficients, the k = 2 and k = 4 conservative coefficients largely exhibit the expected decay rates in l, though the k = 4 modes become contaminated by numerical error at higher values of l. The higher k-modes are almost entirely dominated by numerical error but are also orders of magnitude smaller than the k = 2 mode. Thus, they can be neglected without introducing significant error to \u3008J\u0307 \u3009cons. For low eccentricities, the numerical error is well captured by our uncertainty estimates and therefore can largely be attributed to the truncation of the SSF mode-sum. On the other hand, for higher eccentricities, our uncertainty estimates do not capture the poor convergence at higher l-modes and thus are most likely due to the large cancellations in the extended homoge-\n15\nneous solutions, as discussed in Sec. III A. Nonetheless, in the absence of these errors, the conservative coefficients converge as expected.\nFinally, we produce one last validation test for our conservative data using the conservative averages \u3008\u03b4E\u0307\u3009cons and \u3008\u03b4L\u0307z\u3009cons. Based on the flux-balance laws in (104), the secular evolution of the energy and angular momentum should be driven by purely dissipative perturbations. Therefore, \u3008\u03b4E\u0307\u3009cons and \u3008\u03b4L\u0307z\u3009cons must vanish for all values of q\u03b80. We find that \u3008E\u0307\u3009cons = \u3008L\u0307z\u3009cons = 0 within the estimated uncertainties of our calculations for all of the resonances listed in Table I. As an example, in Fig. 4 we plot \u3008\u03b4E\u0307\u3009diss and \u3008\u03b4E\u0307\u3009cons, along with their estimated uncertainties, for the e02.12 resonance. While our code produces nonzero values for \u3008\u03b4E\u0307\u3009cons, these values are always orders of magnitude smaller than the dissipative average \u3008\u03b4E\u0307\u3009diss. More importantly, they are also smaller than the estimated uncertainty in \u3008\u03b4E\u0307\u3009cons and, consequently, consistent with zero. We observe similar behavior in \u3008\u03b4L\u0307z\u3009cons and across all of the orbits in Table I."

On the other hand, all of the conservative coefficients of the e05.12 resonance are consistent with zero due to the large numerical errors in our calculation of the SSF at higher eccentricities. We observe that |F\u0303Q,cons2 | is always comparable in magnitude\nto |F\u0303Q,diss2 |, with the coefficients differing roughly by a factor of two across all of the resonances. Furthermore, Im[F\u0303Q,consk ] and F\u0303 Q,diss 2 differ in sign for the 1:2 resonances, but share the same sign for the 2:3 resonances.

In other words, while |F\u0303Q,cons2 |+ |F\u0303 Q,diss 2 | is greater for the 1:2 resonances, the ratio (|F\u0303Q,cons2 |+ |F\u0303 Q,diss 2 |)/|F\u0303 Q,diss 0 | is greater for the 2:3 resonances. In Fig. 5 we use our coefficients to evaluate and plot \u3008\u03b4Q\u0307\u3009diss (solid black lines) and \u3008\u03b4Q\u0307\u3009cons (dashed red lines) as functions of q\u03b80, along with the estimated uncertainty in \u3008\u03b4Q\u0307\u3009cons (gray shaded region). Again, this demonstrates that \u3008\u03b4Q\u0307\u3009cons is generally nonvanishing for all but the e05.12 resonance. Furthermore, comparing these plots with those of previous investigations of the SSF during resonances [29], we see a drastic improvement in our uncertainty estimate.10 In fact, the uncertainties in \u3008\u03b4Q\u0307\u3009cons for the low eccentricity resonances are so small that the regions of uncertainty (the gray shaded regions) are smaller than the dashed red line plotting \u3008\u03b4Q\u0307\u3009cons.\n10 The conservative variations reported in this paper are opposite in sign to those plotted in our previous paper [29]. We believe this is due to a plotting mistake in our previous paper, where we mistakenly set q\u03b80 \u2192 \u2212q\u03b80.\n16\nk,l |, which decays like l\n\u22122; and the\norange diamonds represent |F\u0303Q,cons+S\u2212Ak,l \u2212 F\u0303 Q,B k,l \u2212 F\u0303 Q,D k,l /(2l \u2212 1)/(2l + 3)|, which decays like l \u22124. Because the odd k-modes vanish, we only plot the even modes k = (2, 4, 6). The error bars represent the estimated uncertainty in each coefficient.\n17\nEven if our error estimates were off by an order of magnitude, we would still observe nonvanishing values of \u3008\u03b4Q\u0307\u3009cons, clearly demonstrating that so-called \u201cconservative\u201d scalar perturbations do not necessarily conserve the integrability of our perturbed system, but contribute to the leading-order secular evolution of the scalar charge.\nFinally, we consider the relative error that is introduced to \u3008Q\u0307\u3009 if we neglect the impact of q\u03b80 on the secular evolution,\n\u2206res = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u22231\u2212 \u3008\u3008Q\u0307\u3009\u30090\u3008Q\u0307\u3009 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u3008\u03b4Q\u0307\u3009diss + \u3008\u03b4Q\u0307\u3009cons\u3008Q\u0307\u3009 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 , (109)\nand the relative error due to neglecting potential contributions from conservative perturbations,\n\u2206cons = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u22231\u2212 \u3008\u3008Q\u0307\u3009\u30090 + \u3008\u03b4Q\u0307\u3009diss\u3008Q\u0307\u3009 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u3008\u03b4Q\u0307\u3009cons\u3008Q\u0307\u3009 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 . (110)\nIn Fig. 6 we plot \u2206res (solid black lines) and \u2206cons (red dashed lines) for all of the resonances listed in Table I. The gray shaded regions reflect the range of potential errors one may have due to the estimated uncertainty in \u3008Q\u0307\u3009cons. The quantity \u2206res effectively estimates the post1/2 adiabatic error that the resonance introduces to the\norbital phase of the inspiraling scalar charge. Therefore, we see that neglecting the conservative perturbations induces an error that is equal in magnitude to the standard post-1/2 adiabatic error."

            "text": "In this work we calculated the averaged time rate of change of the Carter constant, \u3008Q\u0307\u3009, due to the SSF for a scalar charge following several different r\u03b8-resonant geodesics. To perform these calculations, we built a new code in C++ that is several orders of magnitude faster than the old Mathematica code used in previous investigations of the SSF. This code makes use of several new algorithms, including a module that numerically integrates the Teukolsky equation using a combination of MST and confluent Heun expansions to populate boundary data, the creation of a window function that enables the application of new analytically known regularization parameters, and a new regularization scheme that uses modesum regularization to directly regularize the Fourier coefficients of our secular averages, \u3008E\u0307\u3009, \u3008L\u0307z\u3009, and \u3008Q\u0307\u3009. We found that our results are consistent with previous investigations of the SSF and satisfy known conservation and\n18\nbalance laws, thus validating our new code.\nUsing our results, we demonstrated that during these resonances the secular evolution of the Carter constant due to purely conservative perturbations, \u3008Q\u0307\u3009cons, does not vanish, but its value varies with the initial phase of the resonance, q\u03b80, as predicted by [24, 26]. This is the first conclusive numerical evidence that during r\u03b8 resonances motion in Kerr spacetime is no longer integrable under conservative scalar perturbations [27]. This is in contrast to nonresonant orbits, where \u3008Q\u0307\u3009cons vanishes exactly, and the perturbed conservative system remains integrable.\nAdditionally, we find that \u3008Q\u0307\u3009cons is comparable in magnitude to \u3008\u03b4Q\u0307\u3009diss, the residual variation in the secular evolution of Q under purely dissipative perturbations. Essentially, ignoring the conservative perturbations at leading order will introduce a post-1/2 adiabatic error to the orbital phase of the inspiraling scalar charge, and this error appears to be equal in magnitude to the error introduced by ignoring resonances altogether. Therefore, it is vital that these conservative contributions are computed accurately, since any errors introduced to \u3008Q\u0307\u3009cons will accumulate over the resonance and the rest of the\ninspiral. This will be a challenge for highly eccentric orbits, which are susceptible to large numerical errors that arise from catastrophic cancellations in the self-force mode sum, just as we saw for the e05.12 resonance studied in this work. Frequency-domain effective source regularization or hyperboloidal compactification may be able to ameliorate these issues, but these remain topics for future work.\nFurthermore, it remains to be seen if \u3008Q\u0307\u3009cons will also vanish when driven by purely gravitational perturbations. Many of the methods and code that were designed for this work can be generalized to the gravitational case. Therefore, moving forward we will compute \u3008Q\u0307\u3009 due to the GSF for a point mass on a resonant geodesic. If, surprisingly, \u3008Q\u0307\u3009cons does vanish in the gravitational case, this may hint at some additional unknown symmetries that are not captured by our scalar perturbation model."

These regularization parameters are derived from the multipoles of the singular SSF contribution, which are defined by\nF S,l\u03b1 (t, r) = l\u2211 m=\u2212l \u222b 4\u03c0 0 d\u2126F S\u03b1(t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6)Y\u0304lm(\u03b8, \u03c6), (A1)\nwhere d\u2126 = d cos \u03b8d\u03c6 and an overbar denotes complex conjugation. As shown in [50, 63, 64], F S\u03b1 can be rewritten as an expansion away from the worldline,\nF S\u03b1(t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) = \u221e\u2211 n=1 B(3n\u22122)\u03b1 \u03c1 \u22122n\u22121 n\u22123, (A2)\nwhere \u03c12 = (g\u0302\u03b1\u03b2 u\u0302 \u03b1\u2206x\u03b2)2 + g\u0302\u03b1\u03b2\u2206x \u03b1\u2206x\u03b2 ; a hat denotes a quantity that is evaluated along the worldline x\u03b1p ; \u2206x\u03b1 = x\u03b1 \u2212 x\u03b1p ; and the expansion terms have the form B\n(k) \u03b1 = ba1a2...ak\u2206x a1\u2206xa2 . . .\u2206xak , where ba1a2...ak are coefficients that do not depend on t, r, \u03b8, or \u03c6. The variable \u221d \u2206x is a bookkeeping variable for tracking the singular \u201corder\u201d of each term.\nTo construct the regularization parameters, one inserts this expansion into (A1) and takes the limit as x\u03b1 \u2192 x\u03b1p , leading to the regularization quantities,\nF [\u22122]\u03b1 = \u22122 lim\n\u2206r\u21920\u00b1 l\u2211 m=\u2212l \u222b d\u2126 Y\u0304lm B (1) \u03b1 \u03c13 ,\nF [\u22121]\u03b1 = \u22121 l\u2211 m=\u2212l \u222b d\u2126 Y\u0304lm [ B (4) \u03b1 \u03c15 ] \u2206r=0 , (A3)\nF [\u22122n+1]\u03b1 = (2n\u22121) l\u2211 m=\u2212l \u222b d\u2126 Y\u0304lm [ B (6n+4) \u03b1 \u03c14n+5 ] \u2206r=0 .\nAfter evaluating these integrals, the regularization parameters are then given by\nF [\u22122]\u03b1 = 1\n2 A\u00b1\u03b1 (2l + 1), F [\u22121] \u03b1 = B \u00b1 \u03b1 ,\nF [\u22122n+1]\u03b1 = D (2n) \u03b1 [ n\u220f k=1 (2l \u2212 1\u2212 2k)(2l + 1 + 2k) ]\u22121 .\nNow consider the effect of multiplying the SSF by some window function f(cos \u03b8). Then, to preserve our regularization scheme, our regularization parameters must be calculated by similarly weighting the singular SSF contribution F S\u03b1(t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6) by this window function, leading to the new parameters\nF\u0303 [\u22122]\u03b1 = \u22122 lim\n\u2206r\u21920\u00b1 l\u2211 m=\u2212l \u222b d\u2126 Y\u0304lm fB (1) \u03b1 \u03c13 ,\nF\u0303 [\u22121]\u03b1 = \u22121 l\u2211 m=\u2212l \u222b d\u2126 Y\u0304lm [ fB (4) \u03b1 \u03c15 ] \u2206r=0 , (A4)\nF\u0303 [\u22122n+1]\u03b1 = (2n\u22121) l\u2211 m=\u2212l \u222b d\u2126 Y\u0304lm [ fB (6n+4) \u03b1 \u03c14n+5 ] \u2206r=0 ,\nIf we expand our window function f(cos \u03b8) around the worldline, then we have f(z = cos \u03b8) = f\u0302 + (\u2202z f\u0302)(z \u2212 zp) + 1 2 (\u2202 2 z f\u0302)(z\u2212zp)2 2 +O( 3). Inserting this expansion into the integrals above, any terms O( ) or greater will\nvanish as we approach the worldline. Therefore, if f\u0302 = 1, \u2202z f\u0302 = 0, \u2202 2 z f\u0302 = 0, then we have that A\u0303 \u00b1 \u03b1 = A \u00b1 \u03b1 + O( ) and B\u0303\u00b1\u03b1 = B \u00b1 \u03b1 +O( ).\nHowever, if we want to make use of the higher-order regularization parameter D (2) \u03b8 (assuming it is known), then we must choose a window function that satisfies the four conditions f\u0302 = 1 and \u2202z f\u0302 = 0, \u2202 2 z f\u0302 = 0, and \u22023z f\u0302 = 0. One particular window function that satisfies these conditions is\nf(\u03b8; \u03b8p) = 3\u2211 k=0 \u03b1k(\u03b8p) cos k \u03b8 sin \u03b8, (A5)\nwhere\n\u03b10(\u03b8p) = 2\u2212 7 cos2 \u03b8p + 8 cos4 \u03b8p(1\u2212 cos2 \u03b8p)\n2 sin7 \u03b8p , (A6)\n\u03b11(\u03b8p) = 3 cos3 \u03b8p(1 + 4 cos 2 \u03b8p)\n2 sin7 \u03b8p , (A7)\n\u03b12(\u03b8p) = 1\u2212 8 cos2 \u03b8p(1 + cos2 \u03b8p)\n2 sin7 \u03b8p , (A8)\n\u03b13(\u03b8p) = cos \u03b8p(3 + 2 cos\n2 \u03b8p)\n2 sin7 \u03b8p . (A9)\nBy applying this window function to F ret,l\u03b8\u00b1 , we can reexpand the derivatives of spherical harmonics in terms of spherical harmonics using the following relations,\nsin \u03b8\u2202\u03b8Ylm = \u2212(l + 1)ClmYl\u22121,m + lCl+1,mYl+1,m, cos \u03b8Ylm = ClmYl\u22121,m + Cl+1,mYl+1,m, (A10)\nwhere\nClm =\n\u221a l2 \u2212m2\n(2l + 1)(2l \u2212 1) .

Furthermore, in this work we set tol = 10\n\u221210. We truncate the sums when all of the modes k \u2208 [kmax \u2212 5, kmax] and k \u2208 [kmin, kmin + 5] satisfy at least one of the convergence criteria set above for all l, jr, and j\u03b8.\nWe require six k-modes to satisfy the convergence criteria before truncating the sum. Note that F\u0302 ret,ljmkn\u03b1\u00b1,jrj\u03b8 vanishes when l+m+ k = odd for most self-force components. In this case, only half of the modes are useful for testing convergence. Consequently, even though six modes must satisfy the convergence criteria, most of the time only three of those six modes are nonvanishing.\nAdditionally, we normalize our results by the coefficient B\u0302\u03b1,jrj\u03b8 when testing for convergence, because this is the last divergent piece of the singular selfforce contribution that we must subtract from our harmonic modes.\nFurthermore, for larger eccentricity orbits, the mode sum is prone to catastrophic cancellation. When this occurs, precision loss can prevent the convergence criteria from being met for a sufficient number of neighboring k-modes. To prevent the sum from never truncating in this scenario,\nwe set the hard limits kmin \u2265 k0 \u2212 kcutoff and kmax \u2264 kinit + kcutoff with kcutoff = lmax + 50.\n5. Given lmax, m, and k, we compute\nF\u0302 ret,lmk\u03b1\u00b1,jrj\u03b8 \u2248 ninit\u2211 n=n0 F\u0302 ret,lmkn\u03b1\u00b1,jrj\u03b8 (B6)\n+ nmax\u2211 n=ninit+1 F\u0302 ret,lmkn\u03b1\u00b1,jrj\u03b8\n+ n0\u22121\u2211 n=nmin[\u03c9] F\u0302 ret,lmkn\u03b1\u00b1,jrj\u03b8 ,\nfor all values |m| \u2264 l \u2264 lmax. The sums are constructed so that we only sum over positive frequencies. Negative frequencies are determined from the symmetries of the mode functions and, therefore, are incorporated into the values of F\u0302 ret,lmkn\u03b1\u00b1,jrj\u03b8 via the harmonic module (see Appendix B 3). Thus, nmin[\u03c9] is given by the requirement that \u03c9mknmin[\u03c9] \u2265 0 and \u03c9mk,nmin[\u03c9]\u22121 < 0. The (l,m, k, n)-modes tend to peak in magnitude near lower values of n and \u03c9mkn. Therefore, if nmin[\u03c9] \u2265 \u22128, then we set n0 = nmin[\u03c9] + 1, else n0 = \u22128. We then set ninit = n0 + 16. Based on trial and error, we find that these choices of n0 and ninit tend to capture the modes with the largest magnitudes in our initial sum.\nWe then continue the sum for n > ninit and n < n0. The n-mode summation is truncated using the same convergence criteria as the k-mode summation [see Step (4)], only we replace F\u0302 ret,lmk\u03b1\u00b1,jrj\u03b8 with F\u0302 ret,lmkn\u03b1\u00b1,jrj\u03b8 and \u2206k with \u2206n. We truncate the sums when all of the modes n \u2208 [nmax\u22124, nmax] and n \u2208 [nmin, nmin+4] satisfy either (4a) or (4b) for all l, jr, and j\u03b8.

Additionally, we require l + jmax = even, since all\n22\nl + jmax = odd modes vanish. In this work we set coupling = 10\n\u221218. The convergence of these modes is fairly uniform, leading to the simplified convergence condition.\n7.

This\ntransformation removes the leading-order oscillatory behavior of the homogeneous solutions, thereby improving the speed of our numerical solver. Therefore, the module first generates initial data for \u03a8\u00b1jmkn and \u2202r\u03a8 \u00b1 jmkn at the boundary points r\u00b1init and then numerically integrate the transformed Teukolsky equation (C1) given in Appendix C. Hyperboloidal solutions are stored at userspecified radial points, which are then transformed back to the radial Teukolsky solutions.\nWe use a combination of methods to generate the initial data. The first method we refer to as the series algorithm. For the series algorithm, we first recast the Teukolsky equation into the form of the confluent Heun equation (D1). We then use the Frobenius method to expand the confluent Heun solution associated with \u03a8\u2212jmkn around the regular singular point at r = r+ [see (D5)], and we perform an asymptotic expansion about r = \u221e for the confluent Heun solution associated with \u03a8+jmkn [see (D10)]. The transformation between the confluent Heun and radial Teukolsky solutions, along with the series expansions about the singular points are provided in Appendix D. The advantage of transforming to (D1) is that the coefficients of the confluent Heun expansions satisfy simple three-term recurrence relations, making it straightforward to compute the expansions to very high order. In some cases, however, the series algorithm will suffer catastrophic cancellation when evaluating \u03a8\u2212jmkn away from the horizon, while the asymptotic series may not decay rapidly enough to sufficiently approximate \u03a8+jmkn at finite radii.\nTherefore, we also make use of a second method, which we refer to as the MST algorithm. For the MST algorithm, we generate initial solutions using the semianalytic function expansions proposed by Mano-SuzukiTakasugi (MST) [59, 60] and expanded upon by Fujita and Tagoshi [67]. In this MST method, one expresses the homogeneous Teukolsky solutions as series of hypergeometric functions. For these series to converge one must first solve for the eigenvalue \u03bd\u2014known as the renormalized angular momentum\u2014which then determines the coefficients of these series. Typically one solves for \u03bd using approximate low-frequency expansions [67], root-finding methods [68], or monodromy techniques [69, 70]. The MST series solutions, along with these methods for computing \u03bd, are well-behaved for lower frequencies, but for large values of j and \u03c9mkn the MST method often suffers from catastrophic cancellations.\nOur old MMA code circumvented this issue by using arbitrary numerical precision, but with CPP we are re-\nstricted to the regions of parameter space that do not experience this large precision loss. We implement the MST expansions in CPP using the same methods as MMA, which are described in Sec. III B of [34] and Sec. 5.3.2 in [71]. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no open-source C++ library that computes hypergeometric functions in the complex domain without using arbitrary precision. Therefore, we designed our own special functions library to implement the MST expansions in C++ and we keep track of any precision lost during the MST calculation to estimate potential errors in our MST solutions due to catastrophic cancellation.\nAs a result, given the mode numbers j and m, frequency \u03c9mkn, spheroidal eigenvalue \u03bbjmkn, and an array of N radial sample points ri where i = 0, 1, . . . , N and r0 < r1 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < rN , we construct the homogeneous Teukolsky solutions as follows:\n1. First we define the initial radial points r\u2212init = r+ + 0.01M and r+init = 50M . If r \u2212 init > r0, then r \u2212 init =\n0.9(r0 \u2212 r+), and if r+init < rN , then r + init = rN + 20M .\n2. Next we construct the initial data for \u03a8\u00b1jmkn and\n\u2202r\u03a8 \u00b1 jmkn at the boundaries r \u00b1 init. First we try to calculate the initial data using the series algorithm. If the series algorithm does not meet the convergence criteria described in Appendix D when evaluated at r\u00b1init and \u03c9mknr \u00b1 init \u2264 0.01, then we solve for the initial values using the MST method. If the estimated fractional error of an MST solution is > 10\u221213 or \u03c9mknr \u00b1 init > 0.01, then we move our initial radial point closer to the boundary, and repeat our initial value calculations, beginning with the series algorithm. For the (+) solutions we double the outer radial points, r+init \u2192 2r + init, and for the (\u2212) solutions we half the distance to the horizon, (r\u2212init\u2212r+)\u2192 (r \u2212 init\u2212r+)/2. We iterate this process until our initial value solutions converge.\n3. After we determine the initial values of \u03a8\u00b1jmkn and\n\u2202r\u03a8 \u00b1 jmkn, we solve (C1) using an explicit embedded Runge-Kutta Prince-Dormand (8, 9) method and an adaptive stepper from the GSL ODE library. We store solutions at the radial points r = ri, and the stored values of \u03a8\u00b1jmkn and \u2202r\u03a8 \u00b1 jmkn are finally transformed back to the Teukolsky solutions R\u00b1jmkn and \u2202rR \u00b1 jmkn by inverting (B17) and its derivative."

This is not an issue when constructing the field outside the source region, where our mode-sum over the homogeneous solutions converges rapidly, and, therefore, we do not need to evaluate these highly oscillatory integrals. However, when extended into the source region, the homogeneous solutions are less efficient at capturing the behavior of the perturbing field, as noted by van de Meent and Shah [61]. In practice, this means that the further we extend our homogeneous solutions, the more extended homogeneous modes we need to include in our mode-sum to accurately calculate the self-force. Therefore, for particularly eccentric orbits of e ' 0.4, higherfrequency modes can make a dominant contribution to our self-force calculation, and these modes will also have large numerical errors due to the catastrophic cancellations encountered when computing C\u0302\u00b1jmkn.

If we use values of lmax \u223c O(20), the standard mode-sum regularization will only produce regular SSF data that is known to about two digits of precision. However, we can reduce the error in our regularized data by fitting for the higher-order regularization parameters.\nTherefore the second part of our regularization module fits for the regular component HR of a formally divergent self-force quantity H using the known higher-order structure of the singular component HS given in (63). We perform this fit by modifying the procedure proposed by van de Meent and Shah [61]. First we decompose H into a series of spherical harmonic l-modes, H l, from which we define the finite, but unregularized quantity,\nHlcut = lcut\u2211 l=0 H l = lcut\u2211 l=0 ( HR,l +HS,l ) (B19)\n= HRlcut +H S lcut , (B20)\nwhere H = Hlcut as lcut \u2192\u221e, while HRlcut and H S lcut refer to the regular and singular pieces of Hlcut , respectively.\n25\nWe then assume, based on the singular expansion in (63), that HSlcut takes the form\nHSlcut = 1\n2 HA(lcut + 1) 2 +HB(lcut + 1) (B21)\n+ lcut\u2211 l=0 \u221e\u2211 n=1 n\u220f k=1\nH D(2n) \u03b1\n(2l + 2k + 1)(2l \u2212 2k + 1) ,\nwhere HA, HB , and HD(2n) are the l-independent regularization parameters for the divergent quantity H. Furthermore, we approximate that HRlcut \u2248 H\nR for a sufficiently large choice of lcut, since the regular multipole contributions HR,l should decay exponentially with l. This gives us the approximate model\nHlcut \u2248 HR + 1\n2 HA(lcut + 1) 2 +HB(lcut + 1) (B22)\n+ lcut\u2211 l=0 ncut\u2211 n=1 n\u220f k=1\nH D(2n) \u03b1\n(2l + 2k + 1)(2l \u2212 2k + 1) .\nUsing known values of Hlcut , we fit for the set of unknown parameters {HR, HA, HB , . . . ,HD(2ncut)}, where we truncate this set of free parameters at ncut. From our fits we estimate HR. If any of the regularization parameters are known, then we modify our model by moving the known parameters to the left-hand side of (B22) and fitting for the remaining unknowns.\nTherefore, we estimate HR using the following fitting procedure:\n1. Given H l in the range 0 \u2264 l \u2264 lmax and some set of known regularization parameters {HA, HB , . . . ,HD(2n\u2032)}, we construct Hlcut for 12 \u2264 lcut \u2264 lmax.\n2. Next we define the tuning parameters lcut,min and lcut,max, which select the values of Hlcut that are used in our fit. As noted in [61], if we choose a value of lcut that is too low, then the approximation in (B22) becomes less accurate and will not produce a good estimate of HR. On the other hand, if we choose a value of lcut that is too high, then we may include l-modes that are dominated by numerical error, and this error will bias our fits. Because we do not know a priori which values of lcut are too low or too high, we allow the tuning parameters to vary in the ranges 12 \u2264 lcut,min < lmax and lcut,min < lcut,max \u2264 lmax.\n3. Given values for lcut,min, lcut,max, and ncut, we perform a least squares fit of (B22) using the set of known values {Hlcut,min , Hlcut,min+1, . . . ,Hlcut,max} and the set of known parameters {HA, HB , . . . ,HD(2n\u2032)}. This gives us a set of fit values for {HR, HD(2n\u2032+2), . . . ,HD(2ncut)}. We refer to this set of fits as h\u03031 = {h\u0303R1 , h\u0303 D(2n\u2032+2) 1 , . . . , h\u0303 D(2ncut) 1 }.\n4. We repeat step 3 for all acceptable values of lcut,min, lcut,max, and ncut,max (i.e., we require the number of known parameters to be greater than the number of free parameters), giving us a several different\nh\u03031 sets. Note that we restrict ncut to the range 3 \u2264 ncut \u2264 6.\n5. We then repeat steps 3\u20134, but this time we leave the highest-order known parameter HD(2n\n\u2032) as an unknown variable. This gives us fits for the set {HR, HD(2n\u2032), . . . ,HD(2ncut)}, which we denote as h\u03032 = {h\u0303R2 , h\u0303 D(2n\u2032) 2 , . . . , h\u0303 D(2ncut) 2 }.\n6. Next, we take the ten sets of h\u03031 that best fit the data Hlcut and the ten sets of h\u03032 that best minimize\n|h\u0303D(2n \u2032) 2 \u2212HD(2n \u2032)|. Combining these twenty sets, we construct a set of twenty fits for HR (i.e., ten values of h\u0303R1 and ten of h\u0303 R 2 ).\n7. Finally we produce two estimates for the uncertainty in our fitted value of HR. First we estimate its uncertainty \u03c3R by taking the median absolute deviation of the combined set of h\u0303R1 and h\u0303 R 2 values.\nSecond, we estimate its uncertainty to be the standard deviation of this same set. If the standard deviation is greater than the median absolute deviation, then we take this to be the final uncertainty in HR, and the value of HR is given by the mean of our combined set of h\u0303R1 and h\u0303 R 2 values. If the median absolute deviation is greater than the standard deviation, then we take this to be the final uncertainty in HR, and the value of HR is given by the median of our combined set.\nThe above fitting procedure gives a simple estimate for HR, but neglects how errors in the input data H l may impact the fitting procedure. A more sophisticated algorithm could incorporate these errors, but we leave that for future work. We find that our method gives consistent estimates even when varying lmax or the number of known regularization parameters. Therefore, the robustness of the current algorithm is sufficient for this work."

(D5) converges for (r\u2212 r+)/(2M\u03ba) < 1, and therefore is suitable for generating initial values for the radial Teukolsky solutions at the initial radial point r\u2212init \u2264 r+ + 0.01M , provided \u03ba > 0.005 or \u03c72 < 0.999975. This condition is met in this work. However, because the coefficients are complex and can alternate sign, it is possible for (D5) to experience catastrophic cancellation before converging to some required precision goal. Therefore, when computing initial data with this expansion, we track any potential precision loss. If more than 4 digits of precision are lost before the series converges to a precision < 10\u221213, then we consider the Frobenius expansion method to have failed.\nOn the other hand, (D10) does not formally converge, just as we expect for an asymptotic series, with the coefficients growing like a+1,n \u223c na + 1,n\u22121/\u03b5CH as n \u2192 \u221e. However, for small values of (2M\u03ba)/(r \u2212 r\u2212) the series will initially decay. Therefore, when we truncate the sum at some finite value of j, (D10) provides a sufficiently accurate approximation of R+.

So we only need to calculate F\u0303J ,\u221e2b\u2032 for b\u2032 > 0. This is consistent with what we see in full numerical calculations of \u3008J\u0307 \u3009H/\u221erad .\n[1] P. Amaro-Seoane, S.
