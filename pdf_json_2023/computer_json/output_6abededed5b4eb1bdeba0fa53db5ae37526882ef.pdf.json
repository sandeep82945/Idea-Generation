    "abstractText": "Tutorial Description Conversational systems are envisioned to provide social support or functional service to human users via natural language interactions. Conventional conversation researches mainly focus on the response-ability of the system, such as dialogue context understanding and response generation, but overlooks the design of an essential property in intelligent conversations, i.e., goal awareness. The awareness of goals means the state of not only being responsive to the users but also aware of the target conversational goal and capable of leading the conversation towards the goal, which is a significant step towards higher-level intelligence and artificial consciousness. It can not only largely improve user engagement and service efficiency in the conversation, but also empower the system to handle more complicated conversation tasks that involve strategical and motivational interactions. In this tutorial, we will introduce the recent advances on the design of agent\u2019s awareness of goals in a wide range of conversational systems. Type of Tutorial Cutting-edge Targeted Audience Target audiences are researchers and practitioners who interested in natural language processing and human-computer interaction. The audience will learn about the stateof-the-art research in conversational AI and the cutting-edge designs of agent\u2019s awareness in various conversational systems. Suggested Duration Half day (3 hours)",

Conventional conversation researches mainly focus on the response-ability of the system, such as dialogue context understanding and response generation, but overlooks the design of an essential property in intelligent conversations, i.e., goal awareness. The awareness of goals means the state of not only being responsive to the users but also aware of the target conversational goal and capable of leading the conversation towards the goal, which is a significant step towards higher-level intelligence and artificial consciousness. It can not only largely improve user engagement and service efficiency in the conversation, but also empower the system to handle more complicated conversation tasks that involve strategical and motivational interactions. In this tutorial, we will introduce the recent advances on the design of agent\u2019s awareness of goals in a wide range of conversational systems. Type of Tutorial Cutting-edge Targeted Audience Target audiences are researchers and practitioners who interested in natural language processing and human-computer interaction. The audience will learn about the stateof-the-art research in conversational AI and the cutting-edge designs of agent\u2019s awareness in various conversational systems.

            "heading": "2 Tutorial Outline",
            "text": "Part I: Preliminary (20 minutes) Conversational agents are generally envisioned to achieve the conversational goal by providing social support or functional service to human users via natural language interactions. In terms of the goal, Part I will present a brief overview of the widely-studied problems and correponding main-\nstream approaches in several typical conversational systems, including open-domain dialogue (ODD) systems (Zhang et al., 2018a; Li et al., 2017; Roller et al., 2021), task-oriented dialogue (TOD) systems (Budzianowski et al., 2018; Lei et al., 2018; Su et al., 2022), conversational question answering (CQA) systems (Choi et al., 2018; Reddy et al., 2019; Anantha et al., 2021; Qiu et al., 2021), and conversational recommender systems (CRS) (Li et al., 2018; Deng et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022).\nPart II: Proactive Conversational Systems (50 minutes) As opposed to responding to users, proactivity is the most prominent feature of goal awareness in conversational systems, which can improve the collaboration between the users and system towards the ultimate conversation goal. Derived from the definition of proactivity in organizational behaviors (Grant and Ashford, 2008) and its dictionary definitions (Dictionary, 1989), conversational agents\u2019 proactivity can be defined as the capability to create or control the conversation by taking the initiative and anticipating impacts on themselves or human users. In this part, we will provide a comprehensive introduction about such efforts on the design of agent\u2019s proactivity that span various task formulations and application scenarios. In specific, we categorize them in three directions according to the application scenario, and plan to discuss their research problems and methods as follows:\n\u2022 Topic Shifting and Planning in Open-domain Dialogues The goal of OOD systems is to maintain engaging social conversations with users. Proactive OOD systems can consciously change topics (Rachna et al., 2021; Xie et al., 2021) and lead directions (Tang et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2022) for improving user engagement in the conversation. We will present the existing methods for topic shifting and planning in opendomain dialogues, including graph-based topic\n1\nplanning (Qin et al., 2020; Zhong et al., 2021; Xu et al., 2020; Ni et al., 2022), responding plan generation (Kishinami et al., 2022), and learning from interactions with users (Lei et al., 2022).\n\u2022 Additional Information Delivery in Taskoriented Dialogues The goal of TOD systems is to provide functional service for users, such as making reservations or managing schedule. The proactivity in TOD systems is firstly defined as the capability of consciously providing additional information that is not requested by but useful to the users (Balaraman and Magnini, 2020a,b), which can improve the quality and effectiveness of conveying functional service in the conversation. We will introduce the recent studies of proactive TOD systems with various designs. For instance, Sun et al. (2021) add topical chit-chats into the responses for TODs. Chen et al. (2022c) enrich task-oriented dialogues with relevant entity knowledge.\n\u2022 Uncertainty Elimination in Informationseeking Dialogues The goal of CIS systems (Zamani et al., 2022) is to fulfill the user\u2019s information needs and its typical applications include conversational search, conversational recommendation, and conversational question answering. Conventional CIS systems assume that users always convey clear information requests, while the user queries, in reality, are often brief and succinct. Recent years have witnessed several advances on developing proactive CIS systems that can consciously eliminate the uncertainty for more efficient and precise information seeks by initiating a subdialogue. Such a subdialogue can either clarify the ambiguity of the query or question in conversational search (Aliannejadi et al., 2019, 2021; Zamani et al., 2020) and conversation question answering (Guo et al., 2021; Deng et al., 2022a), or elicit the user preference in conversational recommendation (Zhang et al., 2018b; Lei et al., 2020a,b).\nPart III: Non-collaborative Conversational Systems (40 minutes) Most of existing conversational systems are built upon the assumption that the users willingly collaborate with the conversational agent to reach the mutual goal. However, this assumption may not always hold in some real-world scenarios, where the users and the system do not share the same goal (He et al., 2018; Wang et al., 2019) or the users\nare not willing to coordinate with the agent (Yang et al., 2019; Kim et al., 2022). In these cases, the conversational agent requires another feature of goal awareness, i.e., non-collaborativity (Li et al., 2020; Zhou et al., 2020), which means the capability of handling both in-goal and off-goal dialogues appropriately for ultimately leading back to the system\u2019s goal. In this part, we will categorize the non-collaborative settings into two groups as follows and cover their to-date work respectively.\n\u2022 The users and the system do not share the same goal. Typical applications include persuasion dialogues (Wang et al., 2019), negotiation dialogues (He et al., 2018; Chawla et al., 2021), and anti-scam dialogues (Li et al., 2020). We will present the approaches for the system to consciously mitigate and resolve the conflict goals with users, including dialogue strategy learning (Dutt et al., 2021; Yamaguchi et al., 2021; Joshi et al., 2021), user personality modeling (Shi et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2021), and response style transfer (Mishra et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2021).\n\u2022 The users are not willing to coordinate with the agent. Example scenarios include calming down the emotional users before solving their problems (Liu et al., 2021b), managing the users\u2019 complaints before providing service (Yang et al., 2019), and handling problematic content during the conversations (Kim et al., 2022). We will introduce the pioneering studies for the system to consciously deal with non-collaborative users during the conversation, including emotion cause analysis (Tu et al., 2022; Cheng et al., 2022), user satisfaction estimation (Liu et al., 2021a; Deng et al., 2022b), and safe response generation (Baheti et al., 2021; Ung et al., 2022).\nPart IV: Multi-goal Conversational Systems (30 minutes) All the aforementioned conversational systems assume that users always know what they want and the system solely targets at reaching a certain goal, such as chit-chat, question answering, recommendation, etc. The system with a higher level of agent\u2019s awareness of goals should also be capable of handling conversations with multiple and various goals. As for multi-goal conversational systems (Liu et al., 2022; Deng et al., 2022c), the agent is expected to consciously discover users\u2019 intentions and naturally lead user-engaged dialogues with multiple conversation goals. We will cover\nthe newly proposed problems in multi-goal conversational systems with their corresponding data resources (Sun et al., 2021; Zhao et al., 2022; Young et al., 2022; Chiu et al., 2022). Then we will discuss two problem settings of multi-goal conversational systems with corresponding state-ofthe-art approaches: (i) The goal sequence is predefined (Bai et al., 2021; Zhang et al., 2021b), and (ii) The next goal needs to be predicted (Liu et al., 2020; Chen et al., 2022b; Deng et al., 2022c).\nPart V: Open Challenges for Conversational Agents\u2019 Awareness and Beyond (40 minutes) In the last part, we will discuss the main open challenges in developing agent\u2019s awareness in conversational systems and several potential research directions for future studies.\n\u2022 Evaluation for Conversational Agent\u2019s Awareness The development of robust evaluation protocols has already been a long-standing problem for different kinds of conversational systems (Zhang et al., 2021a; Peng et al., 2021; Li et al., 2022b). The evaluation for conversational agent\u2019s awareness is a more challenging problem, since it is involved the evaluation not only from the perspective of natural language, but also from the perspectives of human-computer interaction, sociology, psychology, etc. We will cover the latest studies for shedding some lights on this topic, inclusive of popular metrics such as goal completion and user satisfaction (Liu et al., 2020; Lei et al., 2022; Gupta et al., 2022), and modelbased methods such as user simulator (Zhang and Balog, 2020; Sekulic et al., 2022).\n\u2022 Ethics for Conversational Agent\u2019s Awareness Although existing designs of agent\u2019s awareness of goals in conversational systems generally aim at social goodness (Wang et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2021b; Kim et al., 2022), it is inevitably a doubleedged sword that can be used for good or evil. For responsible NLP researches, we will discuss several important aspects of ethical issues in conscious conversational systems: (i) Factuality: Factual incorrectness and hallucination of knowledge are common in conversational systems (Dziri et al., 2022; Honovich et al., 2021). When enabling the conversational agent with awareness, it becomes more crucial to guarantee the factuality of the system-provided information (Chen et al., 2022a). (ii) Safety: Besides general dialogue safety problems, such as toxic\nlanguage and social bias (Saveski et al., 2021; Barikeri et al., 2021), conscious conversational systems need to pay more attentions to the aggressiveness issue during the non-collaborative conversations (Kim et al., 2022; Hu et al., 2022). (iii) Privacy: The privacy issue is overlooked in current studies on conversational systems (Li et al., 2022a; Shi et al., 2022), but the agent\u2019s awareness raises concerns about how these conversational systems handle personal information obtained from the users. Furthermore, we will introduce some recent released resources that can be adopted for studying this topic (Ziems et al., 2022; Sun et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2022).\n\u2022 Agent\u2019s Awareness in LLM-based Conversational AI Large Language Models (LLMs) have been demonstrated to be powerful of handling various NLP tasks in the form of conversations, such as ChatGPT (Schulman et al., 2022), LaMDA (Thoppilan et al., 2022), BlenderBot (Shuster et al., 2022), etc. However, these applications are typically designed to follow the user\u2019s instructions and intents. There are still several limitations that attribute to the lack of agent\u2019s awareness, such as passively providing randomlyguessed answers to ambiguous user queries, failing to refuse or handle problematic user requests that may exhibit harmful or biased conversations, etc. In addition, they also fall short of interacting under non-collaborative or system-oriented settings. Therefore, we will discuss the role of LLMs in goal awareness for conversational AI with some latest studies (Huang et al., 2022; Ahn et al., 2022; Yao et al., 2022)."

The rest of the tutorial will present a comprehensive overview of the tutorial topic by discussing the related work as much as possible from other researchers. The discussed approaches are problemdriven and language-agnostic, which means that the introduced content are generally applicable to all languages. The techniques are also not limited to a certain type of dialogues and can be generalized to diverse conversational systems. We have a diverse background for the presenters across multiple institutions in different regions.\nEthical Considerations Artificial consciousness is a broad and essential topic towards \u201cStrong AI\" in the whole AI community (Searle, 1992), which can and should be used for social goodness, but inevitably comes with potential risks. In fact, the awareness of goals is just one of the cognitive aspects of consciousness (Baars, 1993). As part of this tutorial, we will provide a specific section for discussing the ethical considerations and designs for agent\u2019s awareness in conversational systems. This tutorial also provides the opportunity to arouse discussions on how far we can and should go for agent\u2019s consciousness in conversational AI from the view of ethical and responsible NLP researches.\nOpen Access of Materials All tutorial materials will be made publicly available."
