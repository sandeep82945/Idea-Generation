    "abstractText": "Background: The use of contrast media in coronary interventions favors diagnostic success. Contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN) is considered a frequent adverse event in the presence of the risk factor diabetes mellitus (DM). L-Carnitine is a lipid metabolism compound with a possible antioxidant effect. Objectives: to evaluate the effect of L-Carnitine on contrast-induced nephropathy in rats with diabetes mellitus. Method: twenty-eight male Wistar rats (250-300g) were randomized into four groups: Citrate (control); Diabetes (65mg/kg of intravenous streptozotocin); Diabetes+Iodinated contrast (meglumine sodium ioxathalamate 6ml/kg intraperitoneal-i.p, single dose); Diabetes+Iodinated contrast+L-Carnitine (50 mg/kg i.p. administered for 5 days). Physiological parameters were evaluated (weight, feed and water intake, glycemia and ratio of kidney weight to animal weight); renal function (inulin clearance, serum creatinine, urinary NGAL and urinary albumin); renal hemodynamics and oxidative profile (urine peroxides, thiols in renal tissue, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in urine and urinary nitric oxide). Results: Contrast-induced nephropathy was confirmed by reduced renal blood flow, increased renal vascular resistance, reduced inulin clearance, increased serum creatinine, and urinary NGAL with increased oxidative peroxide and consumption of antioxidant enzymes. L-Carnitine favored the improvement of renal function and hemodynamics with recovery of redox imbalance. Conclusion: the use of L-Carnitine demonstrated a renoprotective and antioxidant effect.",

Physiological parameters were evaluated (weight, feed and water intake, glycemia and ratio of kidney weight to animal weight); renal function (inulin clearance, serum creatinine, urinary NGAL and urinary albumin); renal hemodynamics and oxidative profile (urine peroxides, thiols in renal tissue, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances in urine and urinary nitric oxide).\nResults: Contrast-induced nephropathy was confirmed by reduced renal blood flow, increased renal vascular resistance, reduced inulin clearance, increased serum creatinine, and urinary NGAL with increased oxidative peroxide and consumption of antioxidant enzymes. L-Carnitine favored the improvement of renal function and hemodynamics with recovery of redox imbalance.\nConclusion: the use of L-Carnitine demonstrated a renoprotective and antioxidant effect.\nKeywords: Diabetes mellitus; Acute Kidney Injury; Contrast Media; Oxidative Stress; Antioxidants.\nWIT HDR\nAWN\nsee ma\nuscr ipt D\nOI fo r det\nails"

            "text": "The indiscriminate use of Iodinated Contrast (IC) means in coronary interventions contributes to the third cause of in-hospital acute kidney injury (AKI); contrast-induced nephropathy (CIN), which has an incidence of 2% in the general population and 40% in the population with risk factors (1-4). CIN is defined by the KDIGO criteria as an increase in serum creatinine of 0.5 mg/dl (44mmol/l) or an increase of 25% in relation to the baseline value, evaluated within 48 hours after contrast administration (5). IC has a direct nephrotoxic effect on the renal tubular epithelium resulting in decreased renal function, apoptosis and necrosis through the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) (6, 7). The pathophysiological mechanism is still not fully understood, but it is known that there is redistribution of the Na+/K+-ATPase pump from the basolateral to the luminal surface with an increase in sodium in the distal tubules, which favors vasoconstriction, which is also mediated by endothelin and adenosine. Additionally, blood viscosity changes in the presence of IC, favoring the plasticity of erythrocytes oriented towards the presence of microvascular thrombosis (8). There are risk factors that increase contrast nephrotoxicity, such as previous renal dysfunction resulting from chronic kidney disease or comorbidities such as diabetes mellitus (DM), with the diabetic kidney being particularly susceptible to intense hypoxia and oxidative stress (7,9). The mechanism by which DM predisposes to contrast-induced nephropathy is still not fully elucidated, however, it may be related to the hemodynamic changes caused by the hyperglycemic action and by the decrease in the renal antioxidant capacity (7, 10). In this context, this study aims to elucidate the action of L-Carnitine (\u03b2-hydroxy-\u03b3-N-trimethyl ammonium-butyrate), which is a compound of lipid metabolism mainly produced by the liver and kidney. However, it can also be obtained through diet in foods such as red meat and dairy products or as a food supplement, currently being prescribed for athletes due to its benefits for energy metabolism (11 - 14). L-Carnitine induces antioxidant proteins such as endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) and superoxide dismutase (SOD), and has a protective action against lipid peroxidation in membranes and against oxidative stress in membranes. endothelial cells (11, 15). Considering the scarcity of current scientific evidence that investigates evaluating the renoprotective role of this compound, this investigation aims to identify the antioxidant action of L-Carnitine in contrast-induced nephropathy in the preclinical model of a risk factor, diabetes mellitus.

The animals submitted to the DM model had their glycemia evaluated by hemoglucotest, 48 hours after induction, using Advantage reagent strips (Advantage \u2013 Roche\u00ae, Brazil). Animals that presented glycemia above 250mg/dl during this period and after one week signs of polyuria, polydipsia and polyphagia were considered to have diabetes mellitus. All DM animals had their body weight and blood glucose monitored for 4 weeks (28 days), once a week. At the end of the protocol, the animals were placed in individual metabolic cages (27th day) for the collection of 24-hour urine for evaluation of renal function and oxidative metabolites. After removal from the metabolic cages (28th day), the animals were anesthetized with ketamine/xylazine (75mg/kg/10mg/kg; Anasedan\u00ae, Vetbrands) intraperitoneally and submitted to the Inulin clearance procedure, for renal function studies . Afterwards, a blood sample was collected by puncture of the abdominal aorta. During the procedure, the animals were kept on a heated surface at 38\u00b0C to avoid hypothermia. The left kidney was removed and refrigerated at -80\u00baC for quantification of the antioxidant enzyme. The animal was euthanized using the physical method of exsanguination, in accordance with ethical standards for animal handling in a research laboratory (17)."

In this sense, comorbidities and risk factors for cardiovascular events that require hemodynamic interventions with IC means become important, characterizing CIN as an in-hospital iatrogenic event (4,7,9). In the search for inexpensive therapeutic alternatives, the present study revealed that L-Carnitine, which has been widely used as a nutritional supplement by athletes (13,25), demonstrated a renoprotective effect through recovery of renal function and hemodynamics, reduction of oxidative metabolites and restoration of endogenous antioxidant reserve in the preclinical model of DM with IC. Chronic hyperglycemia is considered an important precursor of renal pathophysiological mechanisms, as it increases NADPH oxidase levels and mitochondrial protein glycation resulting in oxidative stress, inflammation and cell apoptosis (26,27). The present study revealed clinical signs of DM such as polyphagia, polydipsia, polyuria, albuminuria and renal hypertrophy due to streptozotocin induction. These data corroborate the validation and potential translation of the experimental model for clinical DM comorbidity.

Despite generally being well tolerated in healthy kidneys, ICS infusion can lead to the development of CIN (4, 28, 29). Mechanisms responsible for the development of CIN include the cytotoxic effect on renal tubules; hemodynamic changes; rheological alterations with the production of ROS and renal ischemia (6, 8, 30). The animals that received IC showed a significant increase in serum creatinine, which is the standardized biomarker for evaluating renal function in the clinic. Therefore, its alteration is considered a trigger for the clinical management of interventions in the search for protection of the renal parenchyma (3,4). Moitinho et al demonstrated the presence of CIN by means of a 25% increase in serum creatinine in relation to the baseline value after 48 h after PCI(29). On the other hand, studies with new biomarkers have been used for earlier identification of kidney damage, since, generally, changes in serum creatinine levels can occur over days to weeks. The NGAL biomarker stands out, which is a glycoprotein belonging to the lipocalin superfamily, which can be found in blood and urine (31). Adults and children undergoing PCI showed the predictive role of NGAL in the early diagnosis of CIN (32). This investigation revealed a significant increase in urinary NGAL in animals that received IC, corroborating other preclinical studies (16,19). Additionally, in the experimental context, inulin clearance constitutes the gold standard for GFR assessment. It is a complex technique, but it absolutely reveals glomerular and tubular activity. Couto et al and Fernandes et al demonstrated an increase in inulin clearance in animals that were induced to CIN(19,21). Additionally, an increase in urinary albumin was observed in the aforementioned groups, with albuminuria closely associated with changes in basal glomerular thickening in DM (27). Recent studies have demonstrated a significant reduction in renal function in diabetic rats treated with IC (10, 19,21). In this unfavorable scenario of renal dysfunction, L-Carnitine reversed the parameters described above, inferring a renoprotective action that can be via anti-inflammatory and vasodilator. In renal hemodynamics, a progression in the reduction of renal blood flow was observed between the DM and DM+IC groups, with inversely proportional values in the evaluation of renal vascular resistance. Nephrotoxic drugs act directly on tubular cells and vascular endothelium. There is a chemical interaction in favor of cell injury, which generates the release of inflammatory cytokines IL-6, TNF-\u03b1 and reactive oxygen species such as hydrogen peroxide and superoxide radical (6,8,33,34). Hypoxia sets in and generates an imbalance between vasodilator substances (nitric oxide and prostaglandins) and vasoconstrictors (endothelin, adenosine, vasopressin, angiotensin II and dopamine \u2013 1), which are also activated via the endothelium by contrast osmolarity, contrast viscosity and erythrocyte aggregation that results WIT HDR AWN see man uscr ipt D OI fo r det ails\nin decreased oxygen supply (6,35). Therefore, CIN's mechanism of action is associated with concomitant cellular and hemodynamic events that converge to the worsening of renal function. Elevated glucose, in addition, is related to increased action of the renin-angiotensin system, intensifying vasoconstriction. Studies that evaluated hemodynamic parameters in models with cytotoxic drugs revealed results similar to those found in this investigation (10,21,33). L-Carnitine improved renal perfusion with decreased renal vascular resistance. Experimental investigations have demonstrated that L-Carnitine and its derivative acetylcarnitine influence the activities of mitochondrial metabolism by inhibiting oxidation, adipogenesis and cell death (36,37). Barhwal et al demonstrate the renoprotection of L-Carnitine against the toxicity of drugs that damage mitochondria (38) and Furuno et al revealed that beta-oxidation stimulated by L-Carnitine reduced the toxic effects of fatty acids (39). Therefore, investigations with LCarnitine demonstrate that it is possible to have an increase in the synthesis of mitochondrial ATP and formation of antioxidant enzymes, containing the advance of the injury in the renal tissue (12, 36). Based on its action on energy metabolism, L-Carnitine has been used as a nutritional supplement considering its benefits in restoring antioxidant defenses, increasing protein and albumin levels and improving nutritional status and muscle (including smooth and cardiac muscle) (37). In clinical practice, its supplementation is often used to manage endogenous carnitine deficiency in hemodialysis patients with chronic heart failure and genetic disorders (40). Complementarily, in clinical studies the administration of L-Carnitine has been associated with improvements in cardiovascular injury in patients on hemodialysis, as well as in patients with myocardial infarction, angina, enlargement or dilation of the left ventricle and arrhythmias (37,40,41) . Its antioxidant effects have also been demonstrated in preclinical models, as well as in the present study (36,37). The perpetuation of hypoxia favors ATP depletion and generation of ROS (OH-, O2- and H2O2), which are harmful to the renal parenchyma in favor of lipid peroxidation, resulting in death, apoptosis and DNA damage(42). In this investigation, the elevation of urinary peroxides and TBARS confirm the participation of free radicals in diabetic animals, being intensified in those that received IC. Additionally, the analysis of non-protein soluble thiols in the kidney tissue demonstrated the consumption of the endogenous antioxidant reserve, through the reduction of this variable in the DM and DM+IC groups. On the other hand, treatment with LCarnitine reversed these parameters. Regarding the NO variable, increases were observed in the diabetic groups, with a slight numerical reduction in the group treated with L-Carnitine. The participation of nitric oxide in WIT HDR AWN see man uscr ipt D OI fo r det ails\nrenal injuries is still little known. It is known that NO can interact with the O2- radical and form nitrite peroxide (ONOO-), which reacts with proteins and induces oxidation, reducing the bioavailability of this molecule (NO), which has vasodilator properties (43) . Some studies have shown that L-Carnitine has anti-inflammatory and antioxidant action by increasing the production of nitric oxide and inducing the enzymes superoxide dismutase catalase and glutathione peroxidase (11, 12,15)."

It was possible to observe that the presence of DM contributed to the dysfunctions of renal function, hemodynamics and oxidative stress in the development of CIN, evidenced by the potentialization of renal damage when IC was administered in the diabetic group. Pre-conditioning with L-Carnitine in diabetic animals with CIN showed its renoprotective and antioxidant effect, confirming the hypothesis of this study and highlighting it as a possible therapeutic alternative to revert or prevent CIN in the DM risk factor, as well as to corroborate its nutritional supplementation in clinical practice. However, new preclinical studies, with encouragement from these authors for clinical studies, are necessary to strengthen the results obtained in this investigation."
