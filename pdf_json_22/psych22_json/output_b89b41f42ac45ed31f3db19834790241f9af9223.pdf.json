    "abstractText": "As an important influencing factor of construction workers\u2019 safety performance, safety stressor has received increasing attention. However, no consensus has been reached on the relationship between different types of safety stressors and the subdimensions of safety performance, and the mechanism by which safety stressors influence safety performance remains unclear. This study proposed a multiple mediation model with ego depletion and self-efficacy as mediators between safety stressors and workers\u2019 safety performance. Data were collected from 335 construction workers in China. Results demonstrated that: (1) the three types of safety stressors (i.e., safety role ambiguity, safety role conflict, and interpersonal safety conflict) all had negative effects on workers\u2019 safety performance (i.e., safety compliance and safety participation); (2) self-efficacy mediated all the relationships between the three safety stressors and safety performance; (3) ego depletion only mediated part of the relationships between the three safety stressors and safety performance; and (4) only part of the multiple-step mediating effects through ego depletion and self-efficacy were supported. This study made contributions by shedding light on the mechanism by which safety stressors influence workers\u2019 safety performance and providing more empirical evidence for the relationship between various safety stressors and the subdimensions of safety performance. Additionally, targeted strategies for improving workers\u2019 safety performance were proposed according to the findings.",

However, no consensus has been reached\non the relationship between different types of safety stressors and the subdimensions\nof safety performance, and the mechanism by which safety stressors influence safety\nperformance remains unclear. This study proposed a multiple mediation model with ego\ndepletion and self-efficacy as mediators between safety stressors and workers\u2019 safety\nperformance. Data were collected from 335 construction workers in China. Results\ndemonstrated that: (1) the three types of safety stressors (i.e., safety role ambiguity, safety\nrole conflict, and interpersonal safety conflict) all had negative effects on workers\u2019 safety\nperformance (i.e., safety compliance and safety participation); (2) self-efficacy mediated\nall the relationships between the three safety stressors and safety performance; (3) ego\ndepletion only mediated part of the relationships between the three safety stressors and\nsafety performance; and (4) only part of the multiple-step mediating effects through ego\ndepletion and self-efficacy were supported. This study made contributions by shedding\nlight on the mechanism by which safety stressors influence workers\u2019 safety performance\nand providing more empirical evidence for the relationship between various safety\nstressors and the subdimensions of safety performance. Additionally, targeted strategies\nfor improving workers\u2019 safety performance were proposed according to the findings.\nKeywords: construction worker, safety performance, safety stressor, ego depletion, self-efficacy\nINTRODUCTION\nConstruction is one of the most dangerous industries which incur thousands of fatal and nonfatal injuries every year (Dzeng et al., 2016; Hasanzadeh et al., 2019; Sanni-Anibire et al., 2020; Moosa and Oriet, 2021). According to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (2019), the fatal injuries in the U.S. construction industry stood at 1008 in 2018. The corresponding figure of China was even more striking with 1752 death toll in the construction industry in the first half of 2018 (Ministry of Emergency Management of the People\u2019s Republic of China, 2018). These incidents or accidents threaten the health and safety of site personnel and bring huge losses to\nconstruction enterprises (Nodoushan et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2020; Al-Kasasbeh et al., 2021; Zhou et al., 2021). Therefore, improving construction safety performance has always been a research hotspot. However, despite improvements over the years, safety performance in the construction industry remains unsatisfactory (Gunduz et al., 2018).\nTraditionally, safety performance has been measured by lagging indicators such as the number of accidents, injury rate and death toll (Qi et al., 2022). Nevertheless, these lagging indicators may not provide the insights necessary to avoid future accidents (Grabowski et al., 2007). Hence, scholars proposed that leading indicators should be used to express safety performance (Sinelnikov et al., 2015; Shaikh et al., 2021). Leading indicators are measures of actions taken to prevent accidents (Toellner, 2001). Construction workers\u2019 performance is a typical leading indicator and has been considered as one of the ideal indicators of safety performance (Hinze et al., 2013) in that their unsafe behavior is the frequent, direct, and main cause of accidents (Jiang et al., 2015; Li et al., 2015; He et al., 2020). Eliminating workers\u2019 unsafe behaviors is the biggest challenge to improve safety performance (Fang et al., 2020), and safety performance can be achieved through workers\u2019 safety behaviors (Al-Bsheish et al., 2017). Therefore, this study defines safety performance as workers\u2019 safety behaviors. Based on the job performance theory (Borman and Motowidlo, 1993), Neal and Griffin (1997) proposed two subdimensions of safety performance, i.e., safety compliance and safety participation. Safety compliance refers to \u201cthe core safety activities that need to be carried out by individuals to maintain workplace safety,\u201d while safety participation refers to \u201cbehaviors such as participating in voluntary safety activities or attending safety meetings\u201d (Griffin and Neal, 2000).\nThe premise of improving safety performance is to understand factors that influence safety performance (Sampson et al., 2014). Occupational stressors have been widely recognized to have a significant influence on employees\u2019 job performance (Lu et al., 2016; Leung et al., 2017; Alroomi and Mohamed, 2021). Due to the complex, dynamic and uncertain site environment, construction workers have long been exposed to numerous occupational stressors (Mohr and Wolfram, 2010; Leung et al., 2016; Liang et al., 2021). Safety stressors and safety performance are occupational stressors and job performance within the safety context. Hence, the relationship between safety stressors and safety performance has attracted academic attention. Related studies have focused on examining the relationships between different safety stressors and the two subdimensions of safety performance, and evaluating the moderating effects of supervisor support, psychological capital and safety specific trust on these relationships (Sampson et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2018, 2020). In general, they believed that safety stressors had negative effects on workers\u2019 safety performance. However, the underlying mechanism by which safety stressors affect workers\u2019 safety performance remains unclear, which is not conducive to improving workers\u2019 safety performance from the perspective of safety stressors.\nThe relationship between occupational stressors and job performance varies according to the type of stressors and the\ndimension of job performance examined (Cavanaugh et al., 2000; Lepine et al., 2005; Rosen et al., 2010). In the construction industry, role ambiguity, role conflict and interpersonal conflict are the most common and representative occupational stressors (Melia and Becerril, 2007; Brockman, 2014; De Silva et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2019). Hence, this study is going to explore the effects of safety role ambiguity, safety role conflict and interpersonal safety conflict on workers\u2019 safety compliance and safety participation. Safety role ambiguity occurs when safety-related expectations and information (e.g., safety responsibilities, safety goals and safety behaviors) of workers\u2019 roles are unclear (Rizzo et al., 1970; Jackson and Schuler, 1985; Wang et al., 2020). Safety role conflict reflects that workers receive incompatible safety role expectations (Rizzo et al., 1970; Rosen et al., 2010; Akgunduz, 2015). Interpersonal safety conflict corresponds to disagreements over safety issues between organization members (Gittleman et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2020). According to the conservation of resources theory, job demands-resources model and ego depletion theory, coping with safety stressors may consume workers\u2019 resources, thus increasing workers\u2019 ego depletion and decreasing their self-efficacy. In turn, ego depletion and selfefficacy have been considered to affect safety performance (Dai et al., 2015; Adjekum, 2017). Therefore, this study explored the mechanism by which safety role ambiguity, safety role conflict and interpersonal safety conflict influence construction workers\u2019 safety compliance and safety participation from the potential mediating effects of ego depletion and self-efficacy. In addition, we also provided suggestions for themanagement of construction workers\u2019 unsafe behavior based on the research results."

According to this theory, individuals tend to acquire, maintain, cultivate and conserve resources (Hobfoll et al., 2018). Resources refer to \u201canything perceived by the individual to help attain his or her goals\u201d (Halbesleben et al., 2014, p. 1,338). Individuals use their key resources to cope with stressful situations in the current environment and they also actively construct and protect the existing resources to deal with possible stressful situations in the future. Self-control and self-efficacy are typical individual resources (Hagger et al., 2010; Guarnaccia et al., 2018; Zhong et al., 2020). Self-control refers to the self-suppression of harmful reaction tendency and self-stimulation of beneficial reaction tendency through cognitive, emotional and behavioral strategies (Hagger et al., 2010; Righetti and Finkenauer, 2011). Self-efficacy is the belief in one\u2019s ability to successfully perform a task or achieve a goal (Bandura, 1977). Addressing occupational stressors depletes individuals\u2019 resources, and the loss of resources can trigger burnout (Prapanjaroensin et al., 2017). As a result, individuals will take action to avoid resource losses (Halbesleben et al., 2014).

Job demands are the requirements of work on individuals\u2019 physical, psychological, social and other aspects and the factors that require individuals to pay corresponding efforts or costs to complete the work (De Jonge and Dormann, 2006). In brief, job demands are \u201cbad things\u201d that consume individuals\u2019 energy at work, such as role conflict, role ambiguity and job insecurity (Bakker et al., 2005). On the contrary, job resources are \u201cgood things\u201d at work, referring to physical, psychological, social and organizational resources that help individuals to achieve their goals, reduce job demands, and stimulate personal growth and development (Schaufeli and Bakker, 2004). There are two psychological processes that work influence employees: the stress process and the motivation process (Schaufeli, 2017). The stress process corresponds to the process that excessive job demands and lacking job resources induce burnout which in turn results in negative outcomes such as poor performance. Burnout is characterized by emotional exhaustion, depersonalization, and reduced self-efficacy (Demerouti et al., 2001). The motivation process is akin to the process that abundant job resources improve employees\u2019 work engagement and thus lead to positive effects, such as high job performance."

Ego depletion explains the failure of individuals\u2019 volitional activities such as self-control and regulation (Baumeister et al., 2007). Ego depletion occurs when individuals perform self-control actions such as coping with stress (Baumeister et al., 2007; Schmidt et al., 2007). Conversely, ego depletion will reduce employees\u2019 work engagement and output (Muraven and Baumeister, 2000; Schmeichel et al., 2003). Employees thus exhibit less organizational citizenship behavior and conduct more abnormal behaviors such as workplace deviation behavior and unsafe behavior (Dewall et al., 2007; Barnes and Wagner, 2009; Christian and Ellis, 2011; Lin et al., 2016)."

Rosen et al. (2010) proposed that the effect of stressors on performance varies with the type of stressors and the dimension of performance examined. Sampson et al. (2014) found that all safety stressors that they examined were significantly associated with decreased safety participation while only safety role ambiguity and safety role conflict were significantly related to decreased safety compliance. Based on the work of Sampson et al. (2014), Wang et al. (2018) investigated the relationship between three types of safety stressors (i.e., safety role ambiguity, safety role conflict and interpersonal safety conflict) and construction workers\u2019 safety performance. Their results indicated that the three types of safety stressors all had negative effects on construction workers\u2019 safety participation while only safety role ambiguity had significant influence on workers\u2019 safety compliance. Where after, Wang et al. (2020) examined the relationship between the three types of safety stressors and two types of safety citizenship behaviors (i.e., safety participation). Their findings suggested that safety role ambiguity, safety role conflict and interpersonal safety conflict had negative effects on proactive safety behaviors while only interpersonal safety conflict had negative effects on prosocial safety behaviors. The above studies have not reached a consensus on the relationship between the three types of safety stressors and the two subdimensions of safety performance. Therefore, this study still examined the relationship between the three types of safety stressors and the two sub-dimensions of safety performance.

A large number of studies have shown that job stressors, especially hindrance stressors (e.g., role ambiguity and role conflict), increase the depletion of individuals\u2019 self-control resources, and thus increase ego depletion (Sonnentag and Jelden, 2009; Grebner et al., 2010; Diestel and Schmidt, 2011; Prem et al., 2016; Che et al., 2017; Xia et al., 2020b). The three types of safety stressors involved in the current study are typical hindrance stressors that have negative effects on construction workers. To overcome safety stressors, workers have to use more self-control and self-regulation resources than they would under normal circumstances (Xia et al., 2020b). Therefore, safety stressors may deplete workers\u2019 self-control resources and induce ego depletion. The three types of safety stressors may deplete workers\u2019 self-control resources in different ways. First, faced with ambiguous safety roles, workers need to exert self-control\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 3 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 818955\nto activate information-seeking and resource-seeking behaviors. Second, in the situation of safety role conflict, workers must make behavioral decisions after weighing different expectations, which calls self-control resources. Third, interpersonal safety conflict is easy to induce workers\u2019 negative emotions, such as anger, anxiety, and depression (Spector and Jex, 1998; Jiang et al., 2013; Ten Brummelhuis et al., 2014). Coping with these negative emotions requires effort in self-control (Muraven and Baumeister, 2000; Bertrams and Pahl, 2014; Prem et al., 2016). All the three types of safety stressors can increase the depletion of workers\u2019 self-control resources and thus increase workers\u2019 ego depletion. Hence, we hypothesize:\nH3: Safety role ambiguity (H3a), safety role conflict (H3b) and interpersonal safety conflict (H3c) have positive effects on ego depletion."

Self-control is the process by which people overcome impulse, habit or automated response, and consciously control their behaviors, including inhibiting impulse to incorrect behaviors and activating correct behaviors (Tangney et al., 2004; Hagger et al., 2010; Hale and Borys, 2013). Workers\u2019 self-control is essential for maintaining a high level of safety behaviors (Probst and Brubaker, 2001). Failures of self-control lead to an increase in risky behaviors or unsafe behaviors, thereby impairing safety performance (Salmon et al., 2014; Dai et al., 2015). For example, minor violations are the prepotent response of workers and may be reinforced into habitual violations that are carried out in a non-thinking and automated way (Reason et al., 1998; Hinsz et al., 2007). As workers\u2019 self-control ability and willingness decline, their resistance to the impulse of automated behaviors also declines. Therefore, they cannot resist the habitual impulse to violate safety regulations, resulting in increased violations and reduced safety compliance. In addition, according to the COR theory (Hobfoll, 1989), workers are inclined to conserve their limited resources. Especially when they have consumed self-control resources, they would be more cautious about subsequent resource allocation. Trougakos et al. (2015) proposed that employees would devote their resources to fulfilling work tasks rather than extra-role organizational citizenship behaviors. Similarly, workers who experience ego depletion would devote less effort toward organizational citizenship behaviors, thus reducing safety participation. Accordingly, we hypothesize:\nH4: Ego depletion has negative effects on safety compliance (H4a) and safety participation (H4b).\nAccording to the COR theory and JD-R model, stress factors or job demands such as safety role ambiguity, safety role conflict and interpersonal safety conflict consume workers\u2019 resources. The ego depletion theory further suggests that workers need to invest more self-control resources when experiencing safety role ambiguity, safety role conflict and interpersonal safety conflict.\nThe depletion of self-control resources puts workers into the state of ego depletion (Hagger et al., 2010). Workers\u2019 ability and willingness to engage in subsequent self-control activities decrease. Accordingly, workers may engage in more violations (e.g., unsafe behavior) or perform less organizational citizenship behavior (Barnes and Wagner, 2009; Lin et al., 2016). In brief, dealing with safety role ambiguity, safety role conflict and interpersonal safety conflict increase the possibility of workers\u2019 ego depletion whichmay damage safety performance. That is, ego depletion may mediate the relationship between safety stressors and safety performance. As a result, we hypothesize:\nH5: Ego depletion mediates the relationships between safety stressors [safety role ambiguity (H5a), safety role conflict (H5b) and interpersonal safety conflict (H5c)] and safety compliance. H6: Ego depletion mediates the relationships between safety stressors [safety role ambiguity (H6a), safety role conflict (H6b), interpersonal safety conflict (H6c)] and safety participation."

Namely, job demands can lead to a decrease in self-efficacy. Role ambiguity, role conflict and interpersonal conflict are widely regarded as a kind of hindering job demands (Lorente Prieto et al., 2008; Ashill and Rod, 2011; Martinez-Corts et al., 2015; Kilroy et al., 2016; Kim and Beehr, 2018; Kim et al., 2020). Previous studies have also shown that role ambiguity, role conflict and interpersonal conflict were negatively correlated with individuals\u2019 self-efficacy (Jex and Gudanowski, 1992; Hartline and Ferrell, 1996; Chebat and Kollias, 2000; Eys and Carron, 2001; Karatepe et al., 2006; Li and Bagger, 2008; Tang and Chang, 2010; Kadir et al., 2017). We can infer that safety role ambiguity, safety role conflict and interpersonal safety conflict may contribute to the decrease of workers\u2019 self-efficacy. To be exact, safety role ambiguity means that workers lack sufficient information to properly assess their ability to perform safety tasks, thus inhibiting their ability to visualize their performance. This reduces workers\u2019 confidence in their ability to complete safety tasks (Bandura, 1977). Experiencing safety role conflict and interpersonal safety conflict can also reduce workers\u2019 self-efficacy because conflicting environment makes workers question their ability (Tang and Chang, 2010).\nH7: Safety role ambiguity (H7a), safety role conflict (H7b) and interpersonal safety conflict (H7c) have negative effects on self-efficacy."

Likewise, workers who have more belief in self-efficacy are more confident in their ability to complete extra-role tasks (Parker, 2000). They are more likely to participate in safety activities and help colleagues, thus increasing safety participation. On the contrary, workers with low self-efficacy have less confidence in their ability to complete safety-related tasks. They do not trust that they could be more professional than others. Therefore, they are not inclined to voice their safety opinions and help colleagues with safety issues. Nor do they think they can learn more safety skills or understand more safety rules. As a result, workers who have less belief in self-efficacy may have poor safety performance.\nH8: Self-efficacy has positive effects on safety compliance (H8a) and safety participation (H8b)\nAs safety stressors can reduce workers\u2019 self-efficacy and workers\u2019 self-efficacy positively correlate with their safety performance, we can infer that self-efficacy may mediate the relationship between safety stressors and safety performance.

Selfefficacy is not an entirely automated process but one that requires self-control, since individuals need to ignore or deal with doubt and fear to maintain confidence (DeBono and Muraven, 2013). Workers who experience ego depletion may find it necessary to conserve resources (Job et al., 2010). They would reduce their self-efficacy for subsequent self-control to conserve resources (Chow et al., 2015). Furthermore, workers who suffer ego depletion may have more negative evaluations of themselves and more negative predictions of their subsequent performance (DeBono and Muraven, 2013). In other words, ego depletion makes workers believe that they are inefficacious (Chow et al., 2015), thus decreasing their self-efficacy in subsequent tasks (Fischer et al., 2007; Graham and Steven, 2015; Graham et al., 2017).\nH11: Ego depletion has negative effects on self-efficacy.\nAs stated above, the three types of safety stressors may have positive effects on workers\u2019 ego depletion.

In the second step, the influence of independent variables on meditators and the effect of mediators on dependent variables were examined (testing H3, H4, H7, and H8). The last step was to develop a structural equation model of the multiple mediation model to examine themediation effects (testing H5, H6, H12, and H13). Bias-corrected (BC) bootstrap method was used to define the confidence intervals (CI) for examining the significance of the indirect effects."

As shown in Table 3, Cronbach\u2019s alpha value of variables ranged from 0.799 to 0.912, reaching the accepted threshold value of 0.7 (Nunnally, 1978). Hence, it can be concluded that the measurement model had good reliability. Both convergent validity and discriminant validity were tested in this study. Convergent validity was assessed by the indices of standard factor loading (SFL), construct reliability (CR), and average variance extracted (AVE). Results of the convergent validity testing are presented in Table 3. To ensure good convergent validity, the SFL values should exceed 0.5 (Hair et al., 2006), while the CR values and AVE values should be >0.6 and 0.5, respectively\n(Fornell and Larcker, 1981). It can be seen from Table 3 that SFL were all significant (p < 0.001) and most indicators were above 0.5 (only one indicator being less than 0.5). CR values ranged from 0.804 to 0.913. And most of the AVE values reached the threshold of 0.5. Therefore, the convergence reliability of the measurement model was acceptable. Discriminant validity was examined by comparing the square root of AVE and the correlation coefficients between variables. The square root of a variable\u2019s AVE should be higher than the correlation coefficients involving that variable (Fornell and Larcker, 1981). The Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients between variables and the square root of AVE are shown in Table 2. All the square root of AVE was higher than the involving correlation coefficients, revealing that the discriminant validity of each construct was acceptable."

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "Prior studies have discussed the effects of safety role ambiguity, safety role conflict, and interpersonal safety conflict on workers\u2019 safety performance, but they did not agree on the relationship between these safety stressors and safety performance. They have examined the moderating effects of supervisor support, psychological capital, and safety specific trust on these relationships, but they did not explore the mediating variables in these relationships. Given this, this study investigated the relationships between the three safety stressors and construction workers\u2019 safety performance. Moreover, this study also examined the mediating role of ego depletion and selfefficacy in the relationships between the three safety stressors and construction workers\u2019 safety performance.\nTheoretical Implications First, safety role ambiguity, safety role conflict and interpersonal safety conflict had negative effects on both safety compliance and safety participation. This finding was not completely consistent with previous studies. Sampson et al. (2014) andWang et al. (2018) also found that safety role ambiguity, safety role conflict and interpersonal safety conflict negatively influenced construction workers\u2019 safety participation. However, only parts of the relationships between the three safety stressors and safety compliance were supported in their studies. The discrepancy between our results and the results of Sampson et al. (2014) may be attributed to the different subjects we surveyed. The participants of Sampson et al. (2014) were pipefitters from the United States while our respondents were construction workers fromChina. Both job functions and cultural differences may have influenced the results. As for the inconsistent results between this study and the study of Wang et al., it may be because we used different safety performance measurement scales. Wang et al. (2018) applied the scale developed by Griffin and Neal (2000). We employed the scale modified by Griffin and Hu (2013). Although this finding is not consistent with the research results of Sampson et al. (2014) and Wang et al. (2018), it is congruent with the general job stressors-performance research (Jex, 1998; Wallace et al., 2009; Rosen et al., 2010; Eatough et al., 2011). Safety role ambiguity, safety role conflict and interpersonal safety conflict were hindrance stressors that could reduce job performance (Lepine et al., 2005; Abbas and Raja, 2019). Safety role ambiguity created uncertainty for workers\nand weakened their motivation to maintain and improve safety performance (Beehr and Bhagat, 1985; Celik, 2013). Safety role conflict reflected that workers receive incompatible safety role expectations (Sampson et al., 2014). The most common example is that the organization requires workers to both comply with safety rules and work faster, but sometimes the two goals conflict. Abiding by safety rules is often time-consuming and requires extra efforts, which may affect production and annoy colleagues. To avoid criticism, workers tend to eschew such safe behaviors (Fang et al., 2016), which may decrease safety performance. Interpersonal safety conflict could bring negative emotions (Barki andHartwick, 2004) whichmay lead to workers\u2019 deliberate violations, thereby reducing safety compliance. When conflicts arise between workers and their colleagues, they tend to avoid them and be reluctant to help them with safety issues (Curcuruto et al., 2019), namely, hindering their safety participation.\nSecond, ego depletion mediated parts of the examined relationships between safety stressors and safety performance. Safety role ambiguity, safety role conflict, and interpersonal safety conflict had significant positive effects on workers\u2019 ego depletion which meant that coping with these stressors consumed workers\u2019 self-control resources. Ego depletion, in turn, had negative effects on workers\u2019 safety compliance and safety participation. The ego depletion theory and COR theory provided explanations for this phenomenon. According to the ego depletion theory, ego depletion leads to the decrease of an individual\u2019s willingness and ability to subsequent self-control, resulting in fewer organizational citizenship behaviors and more unsafe behaviors (Baumeister et al., 1998, 2007; Dai et al., 2015). The COR theory suggests that individuals will be more cautious about resource allocation when they lack resources. Faced with heavy tasks and multiple work objectives, construction workers may allocate their limited self-control resources to more important tasks rather than in safety activities, resulting in reduced safety performance (Xia et al., 2019). Safety role ambiguity, safety role conflict and interpersonal safety conflict had significant effects on workers\u2019 ego depletion and ego depletion had significant effects on safety compliance and safety participation. However, ego depletion was found to only mediate the relationship between interpersonal safety conflict and safety compliance, the relationship between safety role conflict and safety participation, as well as the relationship between interpersonal safety conflict and safety participation.\nThird, self-efficacy mediated all the examined relationships between safety stressors and safety performance. Safety role ambiguity, safety role conflict, and interpersonal safety conflict had negative effects on workers\u2019 self-efficacy. This finding could be explained by the JD-R model. Safety role ambiguity, safety role conflict, and interpersonal safety conflict were job demands (Bakker et al., 2005). High job demands could induce burnout and reduced self-efficacy was the core characteristic of burnout (Demerouti et al., 2001). Namely, these safety stressors negatively affected workers\u2019 self-efficacy. Self-efficacy was found to have positive effects on workers\u2019 safety compliance and safety participation, which was consistent with previous studies (Chen and Chen, 2014; Adjekum, 2017; Kim and Jung, 2019). Selfefficacious workers had better feelings of work control and motivation to work safely, whichmay foster their safety behaviors\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 11 January 2022 | Volume 12 | Article 818955\n(He et al., 2019). Safety role ambiguity, safety role conflict, and interpersonal safety conflict had significant effects on workers\u2019 self-efficacy and workers\u2019 self-efficacy had significant effects on workers\u2019 safety compliance and safety participation. Thus, we proposed that self-efficacy may mediate the relationships between safety stressors and safety performance. The results of the empirical study supported our hypothesis. The mediating effects of self-efficacy on the relationship between the three types of safety stressors and the two sub-dimensions of safety performance were all statistically significant. That is, safety role ambiguity, safety role conflict and interpersonal safety conflict could influence workers\u2019 safety performance through workers\u2019 self-efficacy.\nIn addition, ego depletion was found to have negative effects on workers\u2019 self-efficacy. This was because maintaining selfefficacy requires self-control (DeBono and Muraven, 2013). Workers\u2019 self-control resources reduced under the state of ego depletion, thus leading to decreased self-efficacy. Given this, we proposed that there existed multiple-step mediating effects through ego depletion and self-efficacy. However, the empirical results only supported part of our hypothesis about the continuous mediating effects. Only the multiplestep mediating effect of safety role conflict \u2192 ego depletion \u2192 self-efficacy \u2192 safety participation and the multiple-step of interpersonal safety conflict \u2192 ego depletion \u2192 selfefficacy \u2192 safety compliance were significant. It meant that safety role conflict may influence workers\u2019 safety participation through the multiple-step mediation of ego depletion and selfefficacy. And interpersonal safety conflict may affect workers\u2019 safety compliance through the multiple-step mediation of ego depletion and self-efficacy. Although only part of the continuous mediating effects was supported, it was still a useful attempt to explore the complex mechanism between safety stressors and safety performance.\nPractical Implications The results of this study also bring a lot of practical implications. First, in view of the negative effects of safety stressors on safety performance, construction enterprises should systematically identify safety stressors that workers may experience and take measures to eliminate them. Clear job description, safety information and safety role expectation should be provided to workers to avoid safety role ambiguity. Project managers should organize unified training for personnel from different organizations (e.g., sub-contractors) to form consistent safety cognition, thus reducing safety role conflict. In the meanwhile, cooperation should be emphasized to avoid interpersonal safety conflict. However, due to the unique characteristics of the construction industry, safety stressors may not be completely eradicated. Therefore, construction managers should also pay attention to regulating workers\u2019 psychological and physiological states. Workers should be provided with more chances to improve their safety knowledge and skills to improve their self-efficacy. Construction enterprises should also develop more reasonable work schedules to ensure that workers have enough rest time to mitigate ego depletion."

First, this study measured safety stressors, ego depletion, selfefficacy, and safety performance with cross-sectional data. The cross-sectional data is not conducive to revealing the dynamic process in which safety stressors affect safety performance through ego depletion and self-efficacy. Longitudinal data are suggested for future studies. Second, the generalizability of results in this study might be limited because the sample data were obtained from construction workers in western China. Future studies may consider extending the sample to more regions and other high-risk industries. Third, this study only considered three safety stressors, and workers may face other safety stressors as well. As the relationship between job stressors and job performance changes with the type of stressors tested, future studies can explore more types of safety stressors and compare their effects. Finally, ego depletion only mediated part of the relationships between safety stressors and safety performance, and only part of the multiple-step mediating effects through ego depletion and self-efficacy were supported, suggesting that more examination should be conducted in the future."

The results showed that safety role ambiguity, safety role conflict and interpersonal safety conflict negatively affected workers\u2019 safety compliance and safety participation. Ego depletion was found to mediate the relationship between interpersonal safety conflict and safety compliance, the relationship between safety role conflict and safety participation, as well as the relationship between interpersonal safety conflict and safety participation. Self-efficacy mediated all the examined relationships between the three types of safety stressors and workers\u2019 safety performance. Additionally, we found that safety role conflict may influence workers\u2019 safety participation through themultiple-stepmediation of ego depletion and self-efficacy, and interpersonal safety conflict may affect workers\u2019 safety compliance through the multiple-step mediation of ego depletion and self-efficacy. These findings help to clarify how safety stressors influence workers\u2019 safety performance and expand the scope of application of the ego depletion theory, job demands-resources model, and conservation of resources theory. This study also makes contributions by providing more empirical evidence for the relationship between safety stressors and safety performance.
