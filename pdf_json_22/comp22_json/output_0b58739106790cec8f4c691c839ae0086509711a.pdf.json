            "text": "The fast development of technology and Internet contributes new applications to several emerging areas, which include internet of things (IoT), sensor networks, distributed control systems, and the smart grid. In these areas or environments resource-constrained devices are interconnected to accomplish some tasks, where the communication channel is typically wireless. Data transmission through unsecured wireless channel or public networks can be easily browsed, stolen, tampered, copied, and spread illegally. However, the majority of current cryptographic algorithms, i.e., the symmetric cryptosystems and the asymmetric systems, were designed for desktop or server platforms, which could not fit into resource-constrained devices.\nLightweight cryptographic functions are preferable where platform devices are characterized by limited memory, bandwidth and computing capability. National institute of standards and technology (NIST) initiated a project to solicit, evaluate, and standardize lightweight cryptographic algorithms in Lightweight Cryptography Workshop 2015, and 10 finalists were announced in March 20211. A novel trapdoor one-way permutation function based on operating circular convolution over perfect Gaussian integer sequences (PGISs) was proposed in Reference2. With this property, a hybrid public/private key cryptography scheme based on PGIS can serve as the candidate of lightweight cryptographic function2. More properties, construction and applications of PGISs can refer to References3-8.\nIn this study we propose a novel location permutation encryption based on a set of exponential numbers, which is considered the lightweight cryptographic algorithm. As defined and addressed in section 2, the pattern of exponential number can achieve 99% ideal uniformity distribution level and is characterized with quasi-random nature9,10. Possessing with these two merits, exponential pattern can be easily modified to become an ideal uniform distribution pattern which is adequate to serve as permutation algorithm for location permutation. Substitution and permutation techniques are still applied to some modern cryptography, i.e., DES and AES. The comparison between AES and the proposed scheme is analyzed in this paper."

There exists neither the explicit relationship between (\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc52) \u225d (\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5a\u22121\u2505\ud835\udc510) and (\ud835\udc54 \ud835\udc52+\ud835\udc58) \u225d (\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5b\u22121\u2505c0) two patterns, nor the relationship between ge and (gh)e, where h is an arbitrary positive integer, n > m, and d0 might not equal to c0.

In other words, there exists no general expression that can describe the relationship between two patterns obtained from two different exponential numbers. More specifically, it is especially challenging to find a set of functions \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc58 = \ud835\udc53\ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5a , \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5a\u22121, \u22ef \ud835\udc510), k = 0, 1, \u2026, n, which can be used to describe the relationship between \ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc5b\u22121 \u22ef \ud835\udc360 and \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc5a\u22121 \u22ef \ud835\udc510 for arbitrary {ci} and {di} two sets.\nThe pattern of ge is unpredictable, which is characterized with quasi-random nature. In Reference9 entropy was applied to evaluate the uniformity level of exponential decimal patterns. Regardless of whether the base element is a prime or a composite number, it showed that pattern with length larger than 90 can reach 99.9% uniformity level9."

            "text": "The comparisons between AES and the proposed encryption scheme are summarized as follows:\n(1) Confidentiality level of AES depends on long secret key, where key numbers of AES-128, AES-192, and AES-256 are 1282 , 1292 and 2562 , respectively; while cipher space of the proposed scheme is proportional to ( ) ( )1 /10 10! i NiN + , where\nlonger the length N of message contributes higher confidentiality level. Table 2 presents the comparison of complexity function of ( ) ( )1 /10 10! i NiN + and three AESs, which the number within the  \u2022 mark indicates the boundary where the\nproposed scheme outperforms other three AESs on the same row. It shows that two rounds of circular shift and three rounds of location permutation can achieve higher confidentiality level than AES-128 when message length is N = 30, and it requires only one circular shift and two rounds of permutation when N = 60. To outperform AES-129 and AES-256, only two circular shifts and three rounds of permutation are required when N = 50. In case of one circular shift and two permutation rounds, the proposed scheme outperforms AES-256 when N = 120.\n(2) AES defines four transformations, which are the substitution of data using Rijndael S-box, the shifts of data rows, the\nmixes of columns using a predefined matrix, and the last transformation is performed using the encryption key. AES-256 operates 14 rounds of Add-Round-Key operation according to AES key schedule to ruin any symmetries that may have been introduced by the other steps in the algorithm, thus making it harder to crack. However, the proposed scheme operates i rounds circular shift and i + 1 rounds permutation with i can be as small as 2 or 3, and the encryption and decryption of AES are complicated compared with the proposed scheme.\n(3) The security of AES depends on long secret encryption key, and long key requires more processing power and execution time. In addition, the cost and delay imposed by key distribution make the transfer of business communications to IoT or Internet challenging. Location permutation of the proposed scheme is governed by a set of ideal uniform patterns which are obtained from a set of exponential numbers. Thus, security of the proposed scheme relies on the secrecy of exponential numbers. The existence of unlimited exponential numbers contributes great advantage to operate the proposed scheme; however more complex algorithms for generating long encryption keys are required to operate AES. In addition, because each ideal uniform distribution pattern can be uniquely derived from one exponential number, the storage, management and distribution of a set of ideal uniform distribution patterns are equivalent to process and organize a set of exponential\nnumbers  0 10 1g , ,..., r r rnng g , and it is a less challenging work compared with the counterpart part of AES-256 cryptosystem where all long secret encryption keys are with 256 bits."
