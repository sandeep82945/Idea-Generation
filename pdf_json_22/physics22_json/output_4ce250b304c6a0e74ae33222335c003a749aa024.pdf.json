    "abstractText": "Distributed synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a system in which transmitting or receiving arrays are distributed on multiple platforms or at different locations on one platform. Distributed SAR can be used for high-resolution wide-swath (HRWS) imaging. The typical platform used for distributed SAR is a satellite constellation, which has long baselines and an ideal trajectory. Instead of satellite constellations, this paper focuses on distributed SAR on a single airborne platform, for which the channel error and motion error are coupled. Furthermore, the traditional channel error estimation methods are invalid. Thus, based on the time-domain correlation method (TDCM), this article proposes a joint estimation method of the channel phase error and motion error for the distributed SAR on a single airborne platform. Firstly, a channel error and motion error coupled phase error model of the distributed SAR is constructed. A joint estimation method of the channel phase error and motion error is then proposed. Finally, a simulation and real data processing are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.",

            "text": "The multi-channel synthetic aperture radar (MC-SAR) system is a SAR system with multiple transmit channels or receive channels [1], which has higher dimensional degrees of freedom compared to single-channel SAR. It can effectively improve system performance and extend the scope of applications of SAR systems, such as ground moving target indication (GMTI) [2,3], high-resolution wide-swath (HRWS) imaging [4], and topographic surveys [5]. A traditional MC-SAR is achieved by dividing the whole antenna array into multiple subarrays, i.e., centralized MC-SAR. With the increasing demand for SAR applications, the centralized MC-SAR system is becoming increasingly complex and its antenna aperture is lengthening. This imposes higher requirements on the antenna design and carrier platform. In order to avoid the problems that centralized MC-SAR systems encounter, the concept of a distributed SAR is proposed. Distributed SAR is a system in which transmitting or receiving arrays are distributed on multiple platforms or at different locations on one platform. Through the distributed placement of SAR antennas, a single long aperture antenna is decomposed into multiple small aperture antennas. Thereby, system performance, design flexibility, achievability, and system stability are improved [6,7]. The typical distributed SAR system is a satellite constellation [8\u201310], such as TerraSAR-X, Tandem-X [10,11], or TH-2 [12]. In contrast, this paper focuses on distributed SAR on a single airborne platform, which is mainly applied to platforms with high requirements for stealth and aerodynamic performance, such as\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 3598. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs14153598 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 3598 2 of 20\nsupersonic fighters or reconnaissance aircrafts. Compared with the spaceborne distributed SAR, the connection between the channels of the distributed SAR on a single airborne platform is rigid, and the motion error is not negligible. The HRWS imaging mode is a popular research area of distributed SAR [13\u201317]. For single-channel SAR systems, regardless of the operating mode, a high azimuth resolution and a wide swath contradict each other in system design due to the minimum antenna area limitation [18,19]. Distributed SAR can overcome the minimum antenna area limitation and obtain HRWS imaging by signal reconstruction methods [18,20\u201323]. In addition, compressed sampling has also recently been used to address undersampling SAR [24\u201326]. In [11,17,27,28], distributed SAR imaging with TerraSAR-X and Tandem-X was demonstrated. Before signal reconstruction, spaceborne distributed SAR first needs to compensate for channel errors, including channel amplitude phase errors, range sampling delays, and channel errors caused by the cross-track baseline (CTB). The above channel errors lead to amplitude errors, envelope migration, and phase errors between channels. The envelope migration is estimated and compensated by channel coregistration methods in the range time domain [29\u201331] or range frequency domain [32]. The amplitude and phase errors can be estimated and compensated by the orthogonal subspace method (OSM) [13], the adaptive weighted least square method (AWLSM) [33], the signal subspace comparison method (SSCM) [14,34], or the time-domain correlation method (TDCM) [35,36], among which the first three are more computationally intensive with the TDCM more widely used in real-time processing systems. However, the distributed SAR on a single airborne platform leads to the failure of traditional channel error estimation methods due to the non-negligible coupling of motion error and channel error (collectively referred to as \u201csignal error\u201d in this paper). Therefore, the joint estimation method of the channel phase and motion error needs to be studied. For the distributed SAR motion error and channel error coupling problem, this paper firstly establishes a signal model of the coupled motion error and channel error of singleplatform distributed SAR. Based on this signal model, the phase sequence form of TDCM estimation is then analyzed. A joint estimation method of the channel phase error and motion error for the distributed SAR on a single airborne platform based on the TDCM is also proposed to obtain the acceleration motion error of the platform and the phase error between the distributed channels. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through simulation and real data processing."

The channel envelope migration and phase error due to the CTB of the channel are azimuth time invariant. The second-order phase error due to motion error is time variant, but the coefficients are constant. Secondly, the envelope migration corresponding to the CTB is constant within the scene. The slant range difference corresponding to the CTB varies with fast time \u03c4, leading to a range-variant phase error. However, the range variance of envelope migration caused by the CTB is much less than half of the range cell in the imaging scene and can be considered constant."

First, the azimuth window is added\nto the echoes to equivalently reduce the azimuth beamwidth and azimuth resolution of\nthe system; therefore, since the initial pulse repetition frequency of the system is larger\nthan the azimuth bandwidth, there is no azimuth ambiguity. As a result, the data of both\nchannels are downsampled by a factor of 10 through azimuth sampling point extraction\nfor the equivalent azimuth downsampling case. Channel 1 extracts the 1st, 11th, 21st, etc.,\nslow time samples and Channel 2 extracts the 5th, 15th, 25th, etc., slow time samples.

The spectrum is then reconstructed by using the transfer function method, and SAR imaging is performed by applying the chirp scaling (CS) method.

Single-channel undersampling imaging results.\nThe distributed SAR HRWS imaging results are shown in Figure 13, where the yellow boxes mark the positions of Target A and B and the red boxes are the positions of their ambiguous components. Figure 13a shows the imaging results by using the traditional TDCM, and Figure 13b shows the imaging results using the proposed method. The traditional TDCM does not consider the motion error of the platform, while the proposed method does consider the error. Furthermore, though the OSM is another traditional method, the number of channels needs to be greater than the number of ambiguous components. Thus, the OSM does not fit this system. Figure 13c\u2013f shows the local zoomed images of Target A and B. Figure 13a,c,e show that, after compensation using the traditional method, although the ambiguity is improved compared to the undersampling case, there is still a large residual. The azimuth ambiguity causes the noise floor of the imaging to increase, and the ambiguous component of the strongly scattered target is still more obvious. After adopting the two-step signal error estimation and compensation method proposed in this paper, considering the range variance of envelope migration and the coupling of motion error and channel error, the image quality is significantly improved after estimating and compensating for the signal error. The motion error is also not considered in the OSM. Therefore, the signal error is not correctly estimated and the ambiguity still exists, as in the traditional TDCM. To further illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, Figure 14 shows the azimuth cuts of Target A and B in the scene. Figure 14a,c,e are the azimuth cuts of the imaging results of Target A for the single-channel downsampling, the traditional method, and the proposed method, respectively. Figure 14b,d,f are azimuth sections of the Target B imaging results for the single-channel downsampling, the traditional method, and the proposed method, respectively. The ambiguity suppression capability of the method was measured using the Azimuth Ambiguity-to-Signal Ratio (AASR) [37]. The AASR of Figure 14 is provided in Table 4. Figure 14a,b show that the ambiguous component is severe, and the noise floor is high in the single-channel undersampling case. As shown in Figure 14c,d, after processing by the traditional method, the ambiguity suppression is improved by about 5.6 dB, but ambiguous components are still significant. As shown in Figure 14e,f, the noise floor is reduced by processing with the proposed method, the ambiguity energy is suppressed to below the clutter level, and the imaging quality is significantly improved.\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 3598 16 of 20 Remote Sens. 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 17 of 22\nRemote Sens. 2022, 14, 3598 17 of 20Remote Sens. 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 19 of 22\nFigure 14.
