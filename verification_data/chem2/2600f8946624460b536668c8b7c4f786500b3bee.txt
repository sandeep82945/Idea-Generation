The portions of the text mentioning future research directions or implications for future studies are as follows:

1. "Despite significant progress in the field of microbial production of 1-dehydroanalogues of steroids, a number of problems remain unresolved. First, this concerns the presence of undesirable side activities in industrial biocatalyst strains, leading to the reduction of the 20-keto group and the 1(2)-double bond. In this study, these activities were investigated in more detail for the industrial strain N. simplex VKM Ac-2033D."

2. "Our attempts to block these undesirable activities in N. simplex failed because of the absence of the corresponding genetic tools and the instability of the plasmids introduced in this actinobacteria."

3. "To solve the problem of selectivity of steroid 1(2)-dehydrogenation by whole-cell catalysis, we studied the heterologous expression of the gene coding for KstD2NS, whose expression was found to be the most highly upregulated among the five paralogs presented in the N. simplex genome."

4. "The significant level of hydrocortisone degradation observed in some cases may be associated with the functioning of 'silent pathways' of steroid oxidation, such as the C-19+ catabolic pathway found in M. smegmatis mc2 155."

5. "Despite the fact that the natural mechanisms of activation of the C-19+ pathway have not been established, it can be assumed that the expression of the genes of this cluster or a putative unknown operon containing minor genes for steroid catabolism was activated at incubation of mycolicybacteria in a nutrient medium with hydrocortisone and its conversion products at elevated temperature."

These excerpts suggest areas for further investigation, including the need for better genetic tools for N. simplex, exploring the heterologous expression of specific genes for improved selectivity in steroid dehydrogenation, and understanding the activation mechanisms of silent pathways for steroid oxidation.
