    "abstractText": "Diffusion MRI is commonly performed using echo-planar imaging (EPI) due to its rapid acquisition time. However, the resolution of diffusion-weighted images is often limited by magnetic field inhomogeneityrelated artifacts and blurring induced by T2and T \u2217 2 -relaxation effects. To address these limitations, multi-shot EPI (msEPI) combined with parallel imaging techniques is frequently employed. Nevertheless, reconstructing msEPI can be challenging due to phase variation between multiple shots. In this study, we introduce a novel msEPI reconstruction approach called zero-MIRID (zero-shot self-supervised learning of Multi-shot Image Reconstruction for Improved Diffusion MRI). This method jointly reconstructs msEPI data by incorporating deep learning-based image regularization techniques. The network incorporates CNN denoisers in both kand image-spaces, while leveraging virtual coils to enhance image reconstruction conditioning. By employing a self-supervised learning technique and dividing sampled data into three groups, the proposed approach achieves superior results compared to the state-of-the-art parallel imaging method, as demonstrated in an in-vivo experiment.",

            "text": "Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is widely used for diagnosis and treatment monitoring as it provides structural and physiological information related to disease progression. Diffusion MRI (dMRI) measures molecular diffusion in biological tissues and provides microscopic details of tissue architecture, as molecules interact with many different obstacles while diffusing throughout tissues [16].\nar X\niv :2\n30 8.\n05 10\n3v 2\n[ ee\nss .I\nHowever, dMRI requires repeated acquisitions with different diffusion directions. Echo-planar imaging (EPI), which enables fast encoding per imaging slice, is commonly used for dMRI due to its fast acquisition time. However, single-shot (ss-) EPI is susceptible to severe susceptibility-induced geometric distortion and T2- and T \u2217 2 -induced voxel blurring. These artifacts worsen at higher in-plane resolutions as the time required to acquire each line of k-space increases approximately linearly.\nMulti-shot (ms-) acquisition is an effective approach to mitigate EPI-related artifacts, which segments k-space into multiple portions covered across multiple repetition times (TRs) to reduce the effective echo spacing. However, potential shot-to-shot phase variations across multiple EPI shots can introduce additional artifacts. Recent algorithms, such as low-rank prior methods like lowrank modeling of local k-space neighborhoods (LORAKS) [7,8,14,15,18,17], and multi-shot sensitivity encoded diffusion data recovery using structured low-rank matrix completion (MUSSELS) [19], have successfully addressed this challenge by jointly reconstructing msEPI images through a low-rank constraint applied across the EPI shots.\nIn recent years, deep learning has emerged as a promising approach for image reconstruction, offering potential solutions to the challenges of existing techniques, including long reconstruction times, residual artifacts at high acceleration factors, and over-smoothing [9,6,10]. One notable development is model-based deep learning (MoDL), which leverages an unrolled convolutional neural network (CNN) and a parallel imaging (PI) forward model to denoise and unalias undersampled data [1]. MoDL has also been applied to multi-shot diffusionweighted echo-planar imaging, known as MoDL-MUSSELS, effectively replacing MUSSELS and significantly reducing reconstruction times while achieving comparable results to state-of-the-art methods [2]. MoDL-MUSSELS includes CNN denoisers in both image- and k-spaces, as recent work has demonstrated that utilizing both domains has yielded improvement in performance based on metrics such as PSNR and SSIM [6]. However, it is worth noting that existing deep learning networks for dMRI have typically been trained in a supervised manner, which requires a significant amount of ground truth images that are not easily acquired in EPI acquisitions.\nIn contrast, self-supervised learning [3,25,24] does not rely on external training data and can be used in denoising, reconstruction, quantitative mapping, and other applications. Recent advancements in zero-shot self-supervised learning (ZS-SSL) have demonstrated successful scan-specific network training without any external database [24]. This approach has shown comparable or superior results to supervised networks. However, in dMRI, where the same volume is repeatedly acquired while changing diffusion directions, ZS-SSL typically requires training separate networks for different directions, which can be impractical.\nThe virtual coil (VC) approach is a highly effective technique for enhancing the performance of parallel MRI [5], particularly in the case of EPI that utilizes partial Fourier acquisition. VC generates virtual coils by incorporating conjugate symmetric k-space signals from actual coils. This integration provides\nsupplementary information for missing data points in k-space, further being useful when combined with partial Fourier acquisition. Conceptually, the utilization of VC consistently ensures an image quality equivalent to or exceeds that of the image reconstructed without VC.\nIn this study, we propose a novel msEPI reconstruction method called zeroMIRID (zero-shot self-supervised learning of Multi-shot Image Reconstruction for Improved Diffusion MRI). Our method jointly reconstructs msEPI data by incorporating zero-shot self-supervised learning-based image reconstruction. Our key contributions are as follows:\n\u2013 We jointly reconstruct multiple-shot images using self-supervised learning. \u2013 We train one network for all diffusion directions, which accelerates training\nspeed and improves performance. \u2013 We used network denoisers in both k- and image-space and employed the\nVC [5] to improve the conditioning of the reconstruction. \u2013 In the in-vivo experiment, the proposed method demonstrates more robust\nimages and better diffusion metrics than the state-of-art PI technique for dMRI. \u2013 To our best knowledge, this study proposes the first self-supervised learning reconstruction for dMRI.\nOverall, our zero-MIRID method offers a promising approach to enhance msEPI reconstruction in dMRI, providing improved image quality and diffusion metrics through the integration of self-supervised learning techniques."

For dMRI, we acquired the diffusion-weighted data in 32 different directions using 2-shot EPI, with each shot accelerated by 5-fold (R=5) and employing 75% Partial Fourier, resulting in 15% coverage of the k-space in each shot relative to a fully-sampled readout. Imaging parameters are; field of view (FOV)=224\u00d7 224\u00d7 128 mm3, voxel size =1\u00d7 1\u00d7 4 mm3, TR=3.5 s, and effective echo time (TE) =59 ms.\nSENSE and S-LORAKS reconstructions were performed with MATLAB R2022a using Intel Xeon 6248R and 512 GB RAM. All neural network implementations were conducted with Python, using the Keras library in Tensorflow 2.4.1. NVIDIA Quadro RTX 8000 (RAM: 48 GB) was used to train, validate, and test the network. The denoising CNNs consist of 16 layers of which the depth is 46. For the 16 layer-CNN, we employed a filter size of 3x3. The depth of our network is 46, resulting in a total of 583,114 trainable parameters. The DC layer takes ten conjugate gradient steps, and the reconstruction block iterates ten times, where the MoDL paper [1] has demonstrated the saturated performance. For training the model, the Adam optimizer is used with a learning rate of 1e-3. Leaky ReLU was used as the activation function. For every diffusion direction, one g2 and 50 cases of g1 were generated. The ratio of the number of k-space points of g3:g2:g1 = 1.00:0.80:0.48. We trained a single network for 32 diffusion directions and used that network to reconstruct all directions. For comparison, we trained two separate networks for the individual reconstruction for each shot (zero-SIRID, single-shot image reconstruction). We used the FSL toolbox for diffusion analysis [22,23,13]. To estimate multiple fiber orientations, we used the Bayesian Estimation of Diffusion Parameters Obtained using Sampling Techniques (BEDPOSTX) [4,12,11].\nExample data and code can be found in the following link: https://github.com/jaejin-cho/miccai2023"

The reference images were obtained from 5-shot EPI data that covers complementary k-space lines to each other with the S-LORAKS constraint. While SENSE shows severe noise amplification and remaining folding artifacts, zero-SIRID was able to partially mitigate the noise amplification. S-LORAKS jointly reconstructed two shots, considerably reduced noise, and improved the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Nonetheless, in the selected diffusion directions, folding artifacts were amplified, and the center of the image shows a dropped signal (pointed by yellow arrows). In contrast, zero-MIRID demonstrated robust image reconstruction even with a high reduction factor per shot. The NRMSE and NAE across the diffusion direction are provided in the supplementary material, demonstrating notable reductions in NRMSE and NMAE when the proposed method is compared to S-LORAKS.\nFig. 4 presents the average diffusion-weighted image (DWI), fractional anisotropy (FA) map, and 2nd crossing fiber image calculated from the reconstructed images. S-LORAKS and zero-MIRID produced high-fidelity average DWIs, whereas SENSE and zero-SIRID show remaining artifacts. SENSE, zero-SIRID, and SLORAKS show amplified noise in the center of the FA maps, whereas zeroMIRID effectively mitigated the noise. Furthermore, zero-MIRID well preserved the number of 2nd crossing fibers, often considered a crucial factor in evaluating successful dMRI acquisition [4,12]."

            "text": "In this study, we proposed an improved image reconstruction method for msEPI and dMRI in a self-supervised deep learning manner. In-vivo experiment demonstrates the proposed method outperformed S-LORAKS, the state-of-art PI method for dMRI.\nAcquiring reference images of msEPI can be challenging because each shot is typically highly accelerated and shot-to-shot phase variation prevents jointly reconstructing multiple shots efficiently. Advanced PI techniques that jointly reconstruct many EPI shots can improve the PI condition and provide high-fidelity images, but using a PI method may induce bias to that particular method. Therefore, supervised learning might not be an ideal solution for msEPI. On the other hand, self-supervised learning, which does not require reference images, could be a more suitable approach for msEPI. Due to the difficulty in obtaining reliable ground truth data, conventional quantitative metrics such as SSIM and NRMSE may be less reliable for evaluation. In dMRI, FA maps and 2nd crossing fibers could be used for obtaining more suitable metrics.\nWe trained a single network for all diffusion directions, which improved performance and reduced training time (please see the supplementary material).\nNRMSE and NMAE were reduced from 14.69% to 13.61% and from 15.73% to 14.41%, respectively. The training time for the proposed network was 22:30 min per diffusion direction/slice (on GPU). This is expected to be reduced by transfer learning. Inference took approximately 1 second per direction/slice, and 2-shot LORAKS took approximately 20 seconds per direction/slice (on CPU). Since the images are highly similar across diffusion directions, training on the entire diffusion direction has a similar effect to increasing the size of the training database, thereby enhancing network training. Moreover, using a single network for all directions reduces training time compared to training separate networks for each direction, from 40 min to 22:30 min per direction and slice.\nAs a future work, the simultaneous multi-slice (SMS) technique [21], which is often used for further acceleration, can be easily incorporated into the current network (please see the preliminary images in the supplementary material). At Rsms=5 \u00d7 2-fold acceleration, NRMSE and NMAE were significantly reduced compared with SENSE, from 22.91% to 9.07% and from 26.09% to 11.12%, respectively. g-Slider could be a good application as well [20], because RF-encoded images also have highly similar image features.\nAcknowledgments.
