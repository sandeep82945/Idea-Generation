            "text": "Although organic \u03c0conjugated polymers have been researched for their unique electronic properties and potential uses1,2, a new subclass of \u03c0-conjugated organic polymers with a triplet groundstate has recently been introduced. Research into the discovery of these ground state triplet organic \u03c0-conjugated polymers has increased in the last few years, with works on molecular design and characterization. While many of these efforts are still ongoing, they all follow similar design rules, copolymers composed of electron accepting and electron donating monomer pairs3\u20137.\nBy choosing the right combination of monomers a polymer with a small energy gap between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO), i.e. the HOMO-LUMO gap, can be achieved. This leads to degenerate or near-degenerate frontier molecular orbitals and allows for the unpairing of the normally paired HOMO atoms into two singly-occupied molecular orbital (SOMO) with a biradical nature7,8.\nPrevious computational work has shown that the size of the HOMO-LUMO gap of singlet species directly correlates with the stability of the triplet species. That is, polymers with a small HOMO-LUMO gap also have a more stable triplet ground state. Additionally, the identity of the acceptor monomer was found to have a high correlation with the stability of the triplet groundstate, where polymers that share the same acceptor monomer will have similar electronic properties9.\na Department of Chemistry, University of Pittsburgh, 219 Parkman Avenue, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15260, United States; Email: geoffh@pitt.edu b Department of Chemical and Petroleum Engineering, University of Pittsburgh, 3700 O\u2019Hara Street, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15261, United States \u2020 Electronic Supplementary Information (ESI) available: [details of any supplementary information available should be included here]. See DOI: 00.0000/00000000.\nExperimentally, it is highly impractical to create and characterize every monomer combination. Even computationally, this can require many resources in order to comb through the high number of monomer pairings. This calls for a more efficient method that can sort and eliminate unwanted monomers while preserving those that show promising results.\nThere are many approaches that can be used to accelerate the discovery of new materials. Machine learning (ML) is one method that is becoming increasingly popular in this field10\u201312. However, it requires a large data set, which does not exist in this case. Another method is the genetic algorithm13 (GA) which borrows its ideas from Darwin\u2019s \"survival of the fittest\" concept14\u201316. The GA is an iterative method, where each generation a new set of offsprings are created from the previous generation surviving parents, and those who survive the fit test go on to be the parents in the following generation. The algorithm also includes the possibility of a random mutation, as happens in nature, which can result in an increase or decrease in the survival rate.\nIn this work, we used a genetic algorithm to discover new ground-state triplet polymers. Our data set consists of 1226 monomers, which, if thoroughly combined with each other, would create over 1.5 million (12262) potential polymers to work with. This comprehensive method can be associated with high computational resources and time. The iterative GA method can efficiently sift through the large number of combinations and produce stable ground-state triplet candidates with high confidence. Moreover, multiple GAs can run in parallel, increasing the verity of potential candidates.\nAdditionally, from the GA we can also produce a list of the most common monomers that were used in each GA run. A highly common monomer means that it survived natural selection and passed to the next generation. Also, by promoting a low HOMOLUMO gap, a monomer has a higher chance of creating offsprings.\nJournal Name, [year], [vol.],1\u20138 | 1\nFrom these common monomers we can gain insights into which monomer properties correlate with a stable triplet ground-state in the full polymer."

            "text": "In a previous study, we found a strong linear correlation between the HOMO-LUMO gap of the oligomer\u2019s singlet state and the stability of its triplet9. That is, oligomers with a low HOMO-LUMO gap lead to a stable open-shell electronic structure due to the frontier molecular orbitals being closer energetically. Oligomers with a triplet ground-state tend to have a biradical electronic structure, in which each electron is found in a separate singly-occupied molecular orbital (SOMO).\nUsing these findings halves the number of potential calculations that needs to be performed to find if an oligomer has an open-shell electronic structure, as only the HOMO-LUMO gap of the singlet species is needed. This completely negates the necessity of calculating the electronic energy of the triplet state, and drastically accelerates the discovery of open-shell \u03c0-conjugated materials.\nFurthermore, the oligomers in the aforementioned study were constructed from pairs of electron donor and electron acceptor monomers. However, we discovered that the stability of the triplet ground-state is based primarly on the identity of the acceptor monomer. By expanding the list of electron-accepting monomers we can find better oligomers with a biradical nature."

While the correlation is imperfect, there is a clear trend. To strengthen the correlation, we calculated the HOMO-LUMO gap using both GFN2-xTB and \u03c9 B97X-D3 of randomly generated list of new oligomers from the expanded list of monomers used in this study (Figure S1). See Section 2.3.2 for how these calculations were performed.\nAlthough both the logarithmic and radical functions can describe the correlation, the radical function slightly better (R2 = 0.83) than the logarithmic (R2 = 0.74), both show that a small HOMO-LUMO gap calculated with GFN2-xTB would correlate with a small HOMO-LUMO gap calculated using DFT. As GFN2-xTB is a semi-empirical method, it is much faster than DFT and can greatly accelerate the GA. We therefore use GFN2-xTB\u2013 calculated HOMO-LUMO gap in the GA, and find oligomers that minimize the HOMO-LUMO gap with every generation."

Parents with certain traits make offsprings that end up with some combination of those traits. Offsprings with combinations of traits that help them survive in their environment can produce their own offsprings. This cycle can continue indefinitely or terminate by some external force. At certain points during this process a new, never seen before, trait has a chance to appear due to a random mutation. These mutations can either have no effect, help, or hinder the survival and reproduction chances of a off-spring.\nOur genetic algorithm follows several steps (Figure 1):\n1. Initialization \u2014 which creates a starting population for the algorithm to work with. These are the \"parents\" in the GA.\n2. Selection \u2014 which selects some of the population to survive and continue to reproduce while it eliminates the others, based on some fitness function. This is the survival rate of the population.\n3. Crossover \u2014 which creates a new population from a random combination of two parents from the population that survived the previous step. Here, successful parents create offsprings with a combination of their traits.\n2 | 1\u20138Journal Name, [year], [vol.],\n4. Mutation \u2014 in which, given some mutation rate, some of the current population has its traits changed to a randomly chosen one.\n5. Termination \u2014 After repeating steps 2-4 for some number of cycles, the GA ends with the last surviving population.\nIn this study, the GA was initialized with a population size of 32 oligomers. Each oligomer was composed of a pair of monomers, repeated four time in an alternate fashion (i.e. ABABABAB, where A and B are the first and second monomers in the oligomer, respectively). During the Selection step, we use the GFN2-xTB\u2013 calculated HOMO-LUMO gap as the fitness function and eliminate half of the population, that is, 16 oligomers, with the largest HOMO-LUMO gap. In the Crossover step we create 16 new offsprings by randomly choosing two monomers from the surviving population, which brings the total population size back to 32. During the Mutation step, every oligomer has a 40% chance to have one of its monomers replaced by a random monomer from the entire list of possible monomers. We have used the same hyperparameters for the GA from a previous study done in our group as they have shown to be effective for similar molecular systems17. The GA terminates the Selection\u2013Crossover\u2013Mutation cycle after 40 generations, which we have found to be sufficient in finding the minimal calculated HOMO-LUMO gap (Figure 2). However, since random chance is an integral part of the GA, a single run of the GA can miss many potential oligomers with a low HOMO-LUMO gap\u2014unless the GA is left to run indefinitely, which is an impossible task. For the purpose of saving run time and increasing the chance of finding oligomers with a low HOMOLUMO gap, we ran the GA ten times in parallel."

The objective of our GA, that is, the value it was aiming to optimize, was a small HOMO-LUMO gap. As seen in Figure 2 the GA did do as intended and indeed minimized the GFN2-xTB\u2013 calculated HOMO-LUMO gap. The average HOMO-LUMO gap (Figure 2 Top) shows a significant decrease from the first few generations, while later it is subject to some randomness due to the nature of the GA. However the lowest HOMO-LUMO gap (Figure 2 Bottom) shows a clear trend where the GA does finds oligomers with a very small HOMO-LUMO gap.\nJournal Name, [year], [vol.],1\u20138 | 3\nFrom the bottom figure in Figure 2 it can be seen that after about 40 generations all the runs converged on a very low HOMO-LUMO gap, within the limitations of the GA. Although each run started with a random set of oligomers with different HOMO-LUMO gaps, they all ended with a set of oligomers that, on average, have a lower HOMO-LUMO gap and at least one oligomer with a GFN2-xTB\u2013calculated HOMO-LUMO gap less than 0.01 eV. Based on our observed correlation between GFN2xTB and \u03c9B97X-D3 gaps, these roughly equal to a gap of 1.5 eV. 1426 copolymer candidates have been found to have a GFN2xTB\u2013calculated gap of less than 0.1 eV, which correspond roughly to a \u03c9B97X-D3 gap of 2.8 eV."

The HOMO-LUMO singlet gap, and the electronic energies of the singlet and triplet states were calculated using the \u03c9B97X-D3 functional following the steps described in Section 2.3.2. Of the top 20, four oligomers encountered various problems during one or more of the DFT calculation steps and therefore were removed from further analysis. All of the top 20 oligomers share either one of these two monomers, 35 or 642 (Figure S2). Both monomers share a similar molecular structure, as can be seen in Figure 3 Bottom, except that monomer 642 includes a vinyl bridge.\nIn Figure S3 it can be seen that the \u03c9B97X-D3\u2013calculated HOMO-LUMO gap and electronic energies agree with the GA and the GFN2-xTB\u2013calculated values, as those oligomers indeed have\na small singlet HOMO-LUMO gap and a stable triplet groundstate. This further shows that GFN2-xTB can be a good surrogate for DFT in finding oligomers with small HOMO-LUMO gaps with the GA. While most of the oligomers show similar electronic properties, two of them, one constructed from monomers 642 and 365 and another constructed from monomers 642 and 128, look like outliers. However, we expected to see some variation between the singlet HOMO-LUMO gap and the \u2206ET\u2212S since the correlation is not perfect. On the contrary, those two outliers are the two data points closest to the best-fit line calculated in the previous study9.\nMoreover, the outlier 128-642 can be attributed to its conformation, since its lowest energy conformation found during the geometry optimization steps had the oligomer folded on itself instead of the flat linear conformation the other oligomers showed (Figure S4 (a)). We modified the conformation by manipulating the bond angles to create a more linear conformation using Avogadro2 version 1.95.1, followed by the same geometry optimization and single-point calculations as described in section 2.3.2, The resulting geometry remained in the modified flat conformation (Figure S4 (b)), and the HOMO-LUMO gap of the oligomer decreased from 1.04 eV to 0.35 eV and its \u2206ET\u2212S also decreased from -2.82 eV to -3.23 eV, and it got closer to the cluster of the other oligomers (Figure S3). The outlier 365-630 had the same flat and linear conformation as the other oligomers; however, its backbone includes a 7-membered ring, which breaks aromaticity and disrupts conjugation. We hypothesize that this may be the cause of this oligomer\u2019s properties. Nonetheless, we wish to reiterate that those two outliers still exhibit a stable triplet groundstate.\n4 | 1\u20138Journal Name, [year], [vol.],\nAdditionally, the spin density plots of the top 20 oligomers (Figures 4 for an example and S6 for the rest of the oligomers) show their biradical nature by the delocalization of the two unpaired electrons. It can be seen, in some oligomers easier than others, that the oligomers show higher spin density towards the edges of the triplet ground-state oligomer. This matches with previous computational studies that showed a similar effect on a polymer that has been experimentally synthesized and characterized as having a triplet ground-state7. This effect occurs because of the Coulomb repulsion forces as the two unpaired electrons have the same spin in the triplet state."

            "text": "From the analysis of the top oligomers from the GA, two monomers have been shown to be ubiquitous, 35 and 642 (Figure S2). This further demonstrates that the stability of the triplet ground-state is frequently controlled by one of the two monomers in the oligomer. That is, some monomers induce a small HOMO-LUMO gap in many of the oligomers they are found in when paired with many different monomers, and we expect these monomers to be more common in the GA. To find which monomers in the set exhibit similar properties, a histogram of the number of occurrences of each monomer in all GA runs was constructed (Figure 3 Top). A higher number of instances in the GA would suggest a higher survivable rate throughout the GA cycle, due to it contributing to a small HOMO-LUMO gap relative to the rest of the population.\nIn fact, it appears that of the 1226 monomers in our data set, only a small subset has been captured by the GA to promote a small HOMO-LUMO gap. In Figure 3 the top 10 most common monomers are highlighted, along with their molecular structures at the bottom. At a first glance some of those monomers show a common electron-accepting motifs, such as monomers 115 and 187 with two highly electron withdrawing nitro groups, or monomer 1212 which is another common acceptor monomer used in various \u03c0-conjugated polymers7,9.\nAnother common motif in the top 10 monomers is the vinyl bridge, also called a vinylene link. The inclusion of a vinyl bridge in the polymer backbone has been shown to lower the HOMOLUMO gap by extending the conjugation of the \u03c0-system, leading to greater delocalization of \u03c0electrons33. As a testament to this hypothesis, our GA found monomers with a vinyl bridge (e.g., monomers number 642 and 187) at a higher frequency than their derivatives without a vinyl bridge (monomers 35 and 115, respectively), as shown in Figure 3. Moreover, Cordaro and Wong have\nalso commented that in their experience, in addition to drastically decreasing the HOMO-LUMO gap, a vinyl bridge also improves the solubility of polymers due to the increase in the polymer flexibility33. Therefore, polymers with a low HOMO-LUMO gap, and potentially a stable triplet ground-state, will benefit from including a vinyl bridge in their backbone\u2014both by lowering the intrinsic HOMO-LUMO gap compared to the non-bridged version and by potentially improving polymer solubility for synthesis, characterization, and application."

            "text": "From looking at the list of the top 10 monomers, the first questions that should be asked are what are the electronic properties of those monomers have in common and if, by discovering this property, we can find other monomers that share it and promote a stable open-shell electronic structure since similar monomers should have similar properties.\nAs mentioned before, we previously showed that the identity of the acceptor monomer has the highest correlation to a stable triplet ground-state9. However, the absolute classification of monomers between acceptor and donor is vague because these are relative terms. These are usually described by their HOMO levels, as a donor monomer will have a high HOMO level, while an acceptor will have a small one. However, an absolute scale is hard to derive, as a monomer with a low HOMO level compared to its oligomer counterpart will behave as the acceptor (Figure S5). A higher difference between the HOMO levels would entail a stronger donor-acceptor pair and vice versa.\nTo classify the monomer into strong and weak acceptors and donors, we needed to set a relative scale because absolute HOMO eigenvalues highly depend on the DFT functional and basis set used. Some have used thiophene as a \"spacer\" monomer in various \u03c0-conjugated polymers, as it is claimed to not affect the electronic properties significantly34\u201337. For the same reason, some have used thiophene as a reference monomer when comparing different donor and acceptor monomers. Therefore, we looked at the relative HOMO and LUMO eigenvalues, as well as the HOMO-LUMO gap and the stability of their triplet state (\u2206ET\u2212S) for all monomers (Figure S7). The single-point calculations using the \u03c9B97X-D3 functional followed the same steps as the full oligomers, as described in Section 2.3.2.\nFor comparison and to reaffirm our results, we also performed single-point calculations on all monomers using the dispersioncorrected CAM-B3LYP functional (Figure S8). The results show similar distributions compared to the \u03c9B97X-D3 single point calculations (Figure S7), showing that those results are functionalindependent.\nThe top ten most common monomers from Figure 3 have small HOMO-LUMO gaps and small \u2206ET\u2212S, as well as relatively low LUMO levels while their relative HOMO levels are more spread out (Table S1). However, these monomers are not all in the extreme ends of any category, and there are other monomers with small HOMO-LUMO gaps, for example, that did not show up as common in the GA as those top ten monomers. We can attribute this to several potential causes:\nJournal Name, [year], [vol.],1\u20138 | 5\n\u2022 Due to random chance in the GA. The GA is a stochastic optimization method, and by chance some potentially good monomers were not selected.\n\u2022 Due to the electronic structure of the monomer. Some monomers with a small HOMO-LUMO gap, for example, have an antiaromatic electronic structure\u2014like monomers with fused alternating 5- and 6-membered rings, such as sindacene. This, we hypothesize, inhibits conjugation in the oligomer and does not promote a small HOMO-LUMO gap.\n\u2022 Due to a human error with the SMILES string of the monomer. Some of the SMILES strings might have the wrong polymerization site due which can break aromaticity and conjugation when the monomer is part of an oligomer.\n\u2022 Due to inaccuracies in the GFN2-xTB calculations. While we have found a correlation between GFN2-xTB and \u03c9B97X-D3 HOMO-LUMO gaps (Figure S1), this correlation is not as strong for small HOMO-LUMO gaps. It is possible that due to this some potentially good monomers did not survive the Selection step in the GA. This is a trade-off that we accept to greatly accelerate the GA.\nSimilarly to the full-length oligomers, a high correlation (R2 = 0.86) was found between the monomers\u2019 singlet HOMO-LUMO gap and the stability of the triplet ground-state (Figure S9). This agrees with previous studies that showed a biradical nature in molecules with a small HOMO-LUMO gap38\u201342."

A representative selection of monomers with a range of values for each property were selected, and an oligomer was created for each monomer and monomer 630\u2014 which was paired with monomer number 642 in the oligomer\nwith the second most stable triplet ground-state (Figure S10). We chose to use monomer 630 over monomer 365, which was paired with monomer 642 and had the most stable triplet ground-state, since it contained a 7-membered ring in its backbone which broke its aromaticity and interrupted its conjugation of the \u03c0system. Monomer 630 has a highly conjugated and aromatic structure that includes a vinyl bridge, and we hypothesized that it will create more consistent and explainable results. The DFT singlet HOMO-LUMO gap and the singlet and triplet electronic energies for each oligomer were calculated as described in Section 2.3.2.\nFigure 5 show the correlation between the monomers\u2019 property versus the oligomers\u2019 triplet ground-state stability. There is no strong correlation between each of the monomer properties and the stability of the whole oligomer, as they show heteroscedastic behavior. That is, monomers with low relative HOMO levels and high relative LUMO levels, HOMO-LUMO gap, and \u2206ET\u2212S show low triplet state stability in the oligomer. On the other end, monomers on the opposite side of those properties do not show a clear-cut correlation between the property and the oligomers \u2206ET\u2212S, at least when paired with monomer 630.\nInterestingly, while oligomers with monomer number 630 were not as ubiquitous in the GA as other monomers were, Figure 5 show that many oligomers that include monomer number 630 did show a stable triplet ground-state\u2014including monomers that are not in the top 10 most common monomers in the GA (Figure 3).

            "text": "The finding above highlights a weakness in genetic algorithms as a whole, as they are limited due to the randomness inherit in their nature. In other words, GAs can find a local optima while sometimes missing the global one. We tried to avoid this problem by\n6 | 1\u20138Journal Name, [year], [vol.],\nrunning the GA 10 times, but even so it is evident that the GA did miss some potential candidates. The likelihood of this happening can be lowered by running the GA for more generations and more times, but then the return-on-investment (ROI) might not be favorable if this takes longer and has higher computational costs.\nAnother point we want to emphasize here, as Figure 5 shows, is that the identity of one monomer does not correlate with the oligomer\u2019s triplet ground state stability, and it is the combination of the two monomers that overall dictates the oligomer\u2019s properties. While we presented here various monomers that were common in the GA (Figure 3), not every oligomer with them had a small HOMO-LUMO gap. For example, monomer 642 was the most common monomer in the GA and in the top 20 oligomers, but when combined with monomer 659 it had a GFN2xTB HOMO-LUMO gap of 1.22 eV \u2014 which would correlate to \u223c5.5 eV DFT HOMO-LUMO gap, according to Figure S1, and a more stable singlet ground state than a triplet one, according to Figure S3, by \u223c2.0 eV."

            "text": "Ground-state triplet polymers have a unique electronic structure and properties that have many possible uses in electronic devices. In this study we demonstrated how a Genetic Algorithm combined with GFN2-xTB, a fast semi-empirical method, can find unique and novel \u03c0-conjugated organic co-polymer candidates with a stable triplet ground-state. Those candidates exhibit a small HOMOLUMO gap, which was previously shown to promote a triplet ground-state electronic structure due to the frontier molecular orbitals getting closer in energy. The spin densities show the biradical nature of those candidates, and the delocalization of the two unpaired electrons over two different singly-occupied molecular orbitals. DFT calculations show a triplet ground-state stabilization for up to 4 eV for the oligomer, and we expect this value to be similar or greater for the full-length polymer.\nIn addition, we have found that a small number of monomers have been found by the GA to promote a small HOMO-LUMO gap. All of those monomers exhibit small HOMO-LUMO gaps on their own, which helped promote a small HOMO-LUMO gap in the full oligomer. However, no other monomers with a small HOMO-LUMO gap were found by the GA, which shows that the GA has its flaws. While the randomness built into the GA can sometimes miss a potential candidate it is still a faster and more efficient method than an exhaustive search over the vast chemical space.\nData Availability Raw data including calculated electronic values, optimized geometries and monomers\u2019 SMILES strings can be found at https://github.com/hutchisonlab/GST_GA.\nAuthor Contributions O.
