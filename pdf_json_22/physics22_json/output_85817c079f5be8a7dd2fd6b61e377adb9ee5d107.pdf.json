    "abstractText": "Table-top extreme ultraviolet (EUV) microscopy offers unique opportunities for labelfree investigation of biological samples. Here, we demonstrate ptychographic EUV imaging of two dried, unstained model specimens: germlings of a fungus (Aspergillus nidulans), and bacteria (Escherichia coli) cells at 13.5 nm wavelength. We find that the EUV spectral region, which to date has not received much attention for biological imaging, offers sufficient penetration depths for the identification of intracellular features. By implementing a position-correlated ptychography approach, we demonstrate a millimeter-squared field of view enabled by infrared illumination combined with sub60 nm spatial resolution achieved with EUV illumination on selected regions of interest. The strong element contrast at 13.5 nm wavelength enables the identification of the nanoscale material composition inside the specimens. Our work will advance and facilitate EUV imaging applications and enable further possibilities in life science.",

High-resolution imaging of microorganisms has important implications for pharmaceutics, medicine, and biological research. Numerous biological imaging techniques have been explored extensively and may be classified by the energy spectrum of the radiation involved. Three possible categories are (1) optical (e.g., confocal, multiphoton, fluorescence microscopy), (2) X-ray, and (3) electron microscopy (EM). Super-resolution visible fluorescence microscopy [1, 2] enables specific chemical contrast for chosen fluorescent labels in cellular and molecular biology. Cryogenic-EM provides near-atomic resolution for macromolecular structure determination. Due to the relatively small penetration depth of the electron [3, 4], EM is complemented by X-ray microscopy, allowing for microscopy and tomography at mesoscopic length scales [5].\n\u2020Chang Liu and Wilhelm Eschen contributed equally to this work.\n*Correspondence: liu.chang@uni-jena.de\n1 Institute of Applied Physics, Abbe Center of Photonics, Friedrich-Schiller-University Jena, Albert- Einstein-Stra\u00dfe 15, 07745 Jena, Germany 2 Helmholtz-Institute Jena, Fr\u00f6belstieg 3, 07743 Jena, Germany 3 GSI Helmholtzzentrum f\u00fcr Schwerionenforschung, Planckstra\u00dfe 1, 64291 Darmstadt, Germany 4 Present address: Carl Zeiss AG, Carl-Zeiss-Promenade 10, 07745 Jena, Germany 5 Leibniz Institute for Natural Product Research and Infection Biology, Hans Kn\u00f6ll Institute (Leibniz- HKI), Adolf-Reichwein-Str. 23, 07745 Jena, Germany 6 Department of Pharmaceutical Microbiology, Hans Kn\u00f6ll Institute (HKI), Friedrich-SchillerUniversity Jena, Winzerlaer Stra\u00dfe 2, 07745 Jena, Germany 7 Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Optics and Precision Engineering, Albert-Einstein-Str. 7, 07745 Jena, Germany 8 Present address: Biochemistry/ Biotechnology, Faculty of Engineering, Hochschule Wismar University of Applied Sciences Technology, Business and Design, Philipp-M\u00fcller-Str. 14, 23966 Wismar, Germany\nWith the advent of third-generation synchrotron sources, X-ray microscopy has matured, offering large penetration depths and nanometer-scale three-dimensional resolution. Hard X-rays with multi-keV photon energies can be used to stimulate X-ray fluorescence from most biologically relevant trace elements in cells and tissues [6\u20138]. However, hard X-rays typically exhibit poor absorption contrast for whole-cell structural imaging.\nA much higher natural contrast between water and biological macromolecules like proteins is found in the soft X-ray region, in the so-called water window at energies between the carbon and oxygen absorption edges at 290\u00a0eV and 540\u00a0eV. Here, microscopes have been implemented to image the whole, dehydrated [9, 10], or frozenhydrated cells [11\u201315], allowing for the visualization of cellular and subcellular features in their native state.\nMeanwhile, recent progress in coherent X-ray and extreme ultraviolet (EUV) sources has led to a growing impact of so-called lensless imaging techniques, also known as coherent diffraction imaging (CDI). Unlike lens-based imaging techniques, CDI avoids absorptive losses and exceeds the resolution limit inherent to image-forming optics [16]. Ptychography [17], a scanning version of CDI, records a sequence of diffraction patterns from overlapping illumination regions on extended objects. This approach computationally retrieves amplitude and phase information of the object and illumination wavefront, which allows the extraction of quantitative information about the material composition.\nDue to the high brightness and coherence requirements, current lensless X-ray microscopes rely on synchrotron-radiation and free-electron lasers [18\u201323], thus limiting the widespread access to CDI techniques. However, in the EUV spectral region, coherent radiation with steadily increasing photon flux and brilliance can be obtained utilizing high harmonic generation (HHG) [24] driven by femtosecond high-average power lasers. Within the past decade, these sources have seen tremendous progress in terms of photon flux and stability [25], which enables nanoscale coherent imaging on a table-top [26] with applications ranging from reflectometry [27] and wavefront sensing [28, 29] to material sciences [30, 31], especially the imaging and inspection of semiconductors and silicon-based nanomaterials [32\u201334]. EUV radiation provides very high absorptionand phase contrast, moderate penetration depth, and still possesses short enough wavelengths to resolve sub-20\u00a0nm structures [32, 35]. Further, a variety of atomic resonances across the periodic table lies in this spectral region, enabling chemically-resolved imaging [36], further complementing the capabilities of X-rays and electrons.\nFor biological applications the EUV spectral region has remained a widely unexplored territory. A first demonstration at 29\u00a0 nm wavelength imaged the outer contours of mouse neurons with sub 80\u00a0nm lateral resolution [37], while the intracellular structures remained unexplored. This was due to the limited penetration depth (sub-100\u00a0nm) into typical biological materials at this particular wavelength.\nIn this work, we present HHG-based EUV ptychographic imaging of microorganisms at a significantly shorter wavelength of 13.5\u00a0nm (92\u00a0eV photon energy). Here, dried and unstained germinating conidia of the filamentous fungus Aspergillus nidulans (A. nidulans) and the cells of the bacterium Escherichia coli (E. coli) are investigated. A large field-of-view (FOV) overview image of the whole sample is provided by ptychography with infrared illumination, which facilitates the identification and pre-selection of\nrelevant regions of interest (ROIs). Subsequently, EUV ptychography provides complex transmission images of the specimens with a half-period spatial resolution of 58\u00a0 nm. Information about the interior material composition of the investigated microorganisms is extracted from these EUV images based on the analysis of the scattering quotient [38]. This scattering quotient micrograph uncovers the composition of the sample averaged along the propagation direction in each pixel of the image. In both investigated samples, different biological compositions have been obtained and successfully assigned to the internal functional units of the respective microorganisms."

            "text": "The recent progress in ultrashort fiber laser systems enables average powers in the kilowatt range while offering millijoules of pulse energy [39]. Driving the HHG process with such lasers results in coherent EUV radiation, nowadays exceeding powers of 10 mW at 47\u00a0nm wavelength [40]. For shorter wavelengths, the conversion efficiency and thus the available EUV power drops off rapidly. As a result, the shortest wavelength at which HHG sources can provide sufficient average power for high-resolution imaging is currently found in the region surrounding 13.5\u00a0nm wavelength [32, 35].\nHere, we use a designated home-built high-power, few-cycle fiber laser system to generate a broadband EUV continuum with a state-of-the-art photon flux of 7 \u00b7 109ph/s/eV at 13.5\u00a0nm wavelength [41]. A detailed description of this EUV generation source can be found in the Materials and Methods\u00a0 section. The basic setup of the ptychographic microscope has been described elsewhere [32]. This setup has been extended to enable dual-wavelength imaging in the infrared as well as in the EUV. A schematic overview is shown in Fig.\u00a01a and b. The reflective optics in the beam path provide sufficient reflectivity not only at their design wavelength in the EUV (13.5\u00a0nm) but also at the infrared\nwavelength of the fundamental laser beam (1030\u00a0nm). We can thus utilize either of the two wavelengths for the illumination of the sample.\nStructured illumination is used for both the IR and the EUV illumination to enrich the spatial-frequency spectrum in the illumination, thus enhancing the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and spatial resolution of ptychographic reconstructions [42]. For this purpose, two amplitude masks with diameters of 300\u00a0\u03bcm for IR illumination and 10\u00a0\u03bcm for EUV illumination were fabricated with a separation of 705\u00a0\u03bcm in a single long-slit Si3N4 membrane, which is mounted on a 2D positioner (Fig.\u00a01c) allowing to switch between the two masks. Both amplitude masks have a spiral shape to tailor the structure of the IR and EUV illumination. The microorganisms to be imaged, are prepared on a Si3N4 membrane that is located a few hundred microns downstream of the illumination masks. They are cultured and plated on the Si3N4 membrane following standard protocols avoiding stains or chemicals (see Materials and Methods\u00a0section). This allows for a simple and straightforward preparation but results in sample dehydration which can alter the native morphology (e.g., reduction of cell size) and chemical distribution [43].\nPosition\u2011correlated IR\u2011 and\u00a0EUV\u2011 ptychography EUV ptychography can provide nanoscale resolution, but also suffers from a small FOV, which scales proportionally to the deployed wavelength. By using the more powerful driving IR laser, an overview image of the sample with a millimeter-scale FOV and micrometer-scale resolution can be captured. Here, we combined the advantages of both spectral regions and demonstrate position-correlated IR- and EUV-ptychography.\nThe method is verified by imaging clusters of dried germlings of A. nidulans conidia, prepared on a Si3N4 membrane. For recording the IR images, a small fraction of the IR beam (~ 0.5 mW) centered at 1030\u00a0nm is selected by ND filters. A diffuser was placed in the beam path to get a more diverse beam, while the HHG gas jet and two 200\u00a0nm Zr filters are removed (see Fig.\u00a01a and b). The whole membrane area was scanned by an elongated spiral grid, resulting in a FOV as large as 0.9mm2.\nThe complex transmission image of the probe is back-propagated numerically to the mask plane (Fig.\u00a01d) and matches the SEM image of the mask (Fig.\u00a01c). The reconstruction (see Materials and Methods\u00a0section) of the complex transmission of the sample membrane at IR wavelength is shown in Fig.\u00a02a. Despite the low spatial resolution (1 ~ 2\u00a0\u03bcm in the selected region, see supplement Figure S2), clusters of A. nidulans are visible, which aggregate in some areas and tend to be sparse in others.\nIn the next step, we performed a high-resolution investigation of the regions of interest (ROIs) with clusters of A. nidulans using the generated EUV illumination. The beam is spectrally selected by the reflective optics at around 13.5\u00a0nm wavelength and spatially filtered by the mask with a diameter of 10\u00a0\u03bcm (see inset of Fig.\u00a01c). The complex probe in the mask plane was again obtained via numerical backpropagation and matched well the structure of the mask (Fig.\u00a01e).\nSince the IR and EUV beams are collinear, the position and inclination of the sample relative to the illumination remain constant, ideally the two scans share the same coordinates. As a result, the positions of both scans are intrinsically correlated, and thus pre-selected ROIs can be directly obtained from the IR image for navigating EUV measurements. We found that the position shear between these images is around 1\u00a0\u03bcm, which\nis comparable to the pixel size of the IR image. Details on the analysis of the position correlation are provided in the supplement.\nFungal clusters containing several A. nidulans hyphae were investigated using various scan grids with the size of 40 ~ 60\u00a0\u03bcm. The reconstructed micrographs are shown in Fig.\u00a02b, c, and e. In these images, hue and brightness encode phase shift and transmissivity, respectively. For further investigation, regions containing a single hypha were selected at smaller raster sizes and imaged. The reconstructions are shown in Fig.\u00a02d and f. The internal structures are visible, including tubular structures inside the hypha, as shown in Fig.\u00a02d.\nTo create a high-resolution image, a second, high-dynamic-range (HDR) measurement of an area that contains a single hypha (as displayed in Fig.\u00a02f) was carried out. The corresponding half-pitch resolution was evaluated by a Fourier ring correlation (FRC) to be 58\u00a0nm (see supplement Figure S2). The dose in this HDR measurement was estimated [5] to be 7.4 \u00d7 104 Gy, which is slightly lower than the dose estimated in previous synchrotron work to image dry specimens in the water window [23]. This value is far below the threshold of radiation damage effects in biological samples [5] (see supplement Figure S4) and no structural changes were observed during the measurements. In addition, we estimated the theoretical dose required to image a feature (representative biological molecules, i.e., carbohydrate, protein, and others) with the voxel size of 100\u00a0nm in a dehydrated cellular environment based on the model reported in prior publications [44, 45]. The detailed dose calculations, found in the supplement, corroborate our resolution estimated (58\u00a0nm halfperiod resolution) from the contrast analysis point of view."

            "text": "For further analysis, the reconstructed amplitude and unwrapped phase of the highdynamic-range image in Fig.\u00a02f are separately shown in Fig.\u00a03a and b, respectively. In this close-up image, the structure of a single hypha is depicted in more detail. At the lower\nend of the germling, a round shape is apparent which does not transmit EUV radiation and can be attributed to the conidiospore from which the germling has grown. From this, a tubulus with a diameter of approximately 2\u00a0\u03bcm is growing with a tip at its end. It appears that the phase (Fig.\u00a03b) at the tip reaches a higher value, which indicates either a change in material or more overall penetrated material. In the next step the scattering contrast, which is related to the cross-section for coherent scattering [46] is calculated from the reconstructed amplitude and unwrapped phase and is shown in Fig.\u00a03c. This quantity combines amplitude and phase contrast in a single real number and therefore gives a measure for the total scattering integrated over the thickness of the sample. Analysis of the scattering contrast indicates that the hypha can be divided into three areas, which are labeled here by i, ii, and iii. It appears that in region i the scattering contrast is the lowest while in region ii the scattering contrast rises and experiences a peak in region iii. We believe that at the top of the hypha (region iii) the so-called \u2018Spitzenk\u00f6rper\u2019 (SK) is visible. The SK is rich in phospholipid vesicles and proteinaceous filaments. It represents the cellular growth point of filamentous fungi [47].\nA detailed analysis of the material composition can be obtained by the projected scattering quotient fq (Fig.\u00a03d), which is calculated from the reconstructed amplitude and phase [20]. The scattering quotient is independent of the thickness and density of the contained materials and depends solely on the chemical composition. In the 2D images presented here, it represents the average elemental composition of the various cellular components along the projection direction in each image pixel. The scattering quotient of a composition mixture can be calculated similarly (see Materials and Methods\u00a0section), and will be found in between the scattering quotient value of each component, depending on their relative proportion. When the proportion of the component possessing a higher scattering quotient value increases, the scattering quotient of this composition will increase accordingly.\nThe reconstructed scattering quotient is subsequently compared to the theoretical values [48], allowing for the identification of the contained materials. The scattering quotient values for the important components of biological samples (carbohydrate, phospholipids, lipids, nuclear acid, and protein) are given in Table\u00a01. Since these values are well separated, the dominating components of different subcellular units can be recognized by scattering quotient analysis.\nHistograms of scattering quotients for the regions 1, 2, and 3 marked in Fig.\u00a0 3d are shown in Fig.\u00a03f. The well-separated modes histograms indicate that the regions have different chemical compositions. In region 1 the average scattering quotient is calculated to be 3.3 , which is close to the value of carbohydrates (fq = 3.5) . Since the hypha was in a dried state, it is assumed that this region consists mainly of the cell wall. From the literature, it is well known that the cell wall of A. nidulans contains mainly glucans and thus carbohydrates [49]. In region 2 the average scattering quotient increases to a value of fq = 4.0 , which implies the existence of biological components with a higher theoretical scattering quotient such as protein (4.3), phospholipid (5.4), and lipid (6) in the mixture in this region, indicating the presence of subcellular components (e.g., microtubules and vesicles). Most interestingly, at the tip of the hypha (region 3) the scattering quotient reaches a peak value of fq = 4.5 . The high scattering quotients indicate the presence of the SK, which is well known for its high phospholipid concentration [50]. The SK is surrounded by a low scattering quotient value ring (Fig.\u00a03e), which may be attributed to macrovesicles containing glucans oligomers required for cell wall biosynthesis [51]."

            "text": "In the next step, E. coli cells, widespread as a prokaryotic model organism, were investigated. As compared to A. nidulans germlings, E. coli cells are significantly smaller with a typical size of 1\u00a0\u03bcm \u00d7 2\u00a0\u03bcm which reduces the overall scattering signal. Therefore, at each scan position, three diffraction patterns with three different exposure times (0.3s, 3s, 9s) were captured and fused into a single high-dynamic range image. The reconstructed complex specimen micrograph is shown in Fig.\u00a04a. The corresponding half-period resolution was estimated by an FRC to be 74\u00a0nm (see supplement). Next to multiple clustered and single E. coli, the reconstruction shows a dense meshwork of the extracellular matrix between single cells in the center. For further analysis, a region that appears to contain two E. coli cells was identified (red box in Fig.\u00a04a). The scattering quotient was calculated for the corresponding region and is shown in Fig.\u00a04b. Low values of the scattering quotient are apparent at the boundary of the cell which indicates that this area mainly consists of carbohydrates, indicating the location of the cell wall. However, it is notable that there seems to be no cell wall between the two objects, indicating that the two entities correspond to a single cell in the stage of cell division. In the center of both bodies the value of the scattering quotient increases, which is consistent with the presence of proteins, DNA (nucleic acid), and lipids."

            "heading": "Conclusion",
            "text": "We demonstrated high-resolution chemically-sensitive EUV imaging of microorganisms using a table-top high harmonic source. Compared to previous work [37], the 92\u00a0eV EUV photons provide a significantly longer penetration depth, enabling imaging of intracellular features of comparably thicker samples in the \u00b5m-range. IR- and EUV ptychography provides a combination of millimeter-squared FOV overview and high-resolution imaging of smaller regions of interest. Sub-60\u00a0 nm spatial resolution is achieved and enables\nuncovering of the structural information of subcellular features. Moreover, an analysis of the quantitative amplitude and phase information obtained by EUV ptychography allows drawing conclusions on the chemical composition of the biological samples. In this way, subcellular components such as the SK of A. nidulans and the cell wall have been identified.\nOur work shows that EUV ptychographic imaging provides unique capabilities and can complement existing biological imaging modalities. First, it offers a high amplitude and phase contrast compared with X-ray microscopy for dried cells (shown in supplement Figure S4b) with straightforward sample preparation. Second, due to the high refractive index contrast in the EUV spectral region, the required dose absorbed by the biological samples to achieve similar resolution is lower as compared to X-ray (i.e., in water window) and electron-based microscopy [44]. We estimate that, with an optimized microscope and a higher photon flux source, achieving sub-20\u00a0nm half-pitch resolution will be possible with a radiation dose of < 3\u00d7 105 Gy, which is below the radiation damage threshold (shown in supplement Figure S4d). Third, ptychography enables to retrieve excellent scattering contrast and averaged elemental distributions can be analyzed without the need for labeling or staining.\nThe imaging performance mentioned above comes in a table-top format, which will allow for widespread use in life science and potentially even in clinical environments. We believe that our work demonstrates the strengths of EUV ptychography to perform high-resolution, chemical-sensitive biological imaging.\nIn the future, a combination with other microscopy techniques such as nonlinear-, fluorescence- or coherent anti-stokes Raman scattering microscopy with visible and infrared illumination appears feasible with only minor modifications of the presented setup. This intrinsically promises position-correlated multi-modal imaging of functional, cellular, and subcellular structures in a single device, even experiments that have not been proposed yet can be carried on."

The amplified pulses are compressed to < 7\u00a0 fs by cascaded noble-gas-filled hollow-core fibers with a residual average power of 30\u00a0W at a repetition rate of 75\u00a0kHz and pulse energy of 400 \u00b5J. These few-cycle pulses are directed into a vacuum chamber and focused into a 700\u00a0\u03bcm diameter gas jet with a backing pressure of 600 mbar argon. A broad EUV continuum is generated, with a photon flux of 7 \u00d7 109 photons/s/eV at 92\u00a0 eV. The separation of the generated harmonics from the high-power driving laser is realized by four grazing incidence plates (GIPs) with a custom design ultrabroad-bandwidth AR coating (R < 10% between 860 and 1180\u00a0nm) for the driving laser and high EUV reflectivity at a grazing incidence configuration. Afterward, the residual IR laser is fully blocked utilizing two 200\u00a0nm zirconium (Zr) foils, which allow a transmission window between 70\u00a0eV and 120\u00a0eV.

            "text": "In the experimental setup, both the sample and mask were mounted onto individual 2D positioning systems with active stabilization by means of a laser interferometer-based feedback loop [32]. For this purpose, the mask and sample were placed on XYZ piezo positioners (SLC 1740, SmarAct GmbH) and the positions were measured and actively stabilized by a laser interferometer (Picoscale, SmarAct GmbH). This setup improved the long-term stability of the positioners, which is crucial for ptychography. The diffraction patterns were recorded by a CCD detector (Andor iKon-L, 13.5\u00a0\u03bcm pixel size, 2048 \u00d7 2048) at a sample-detector distance of 31\u00a0mm, leading to a detection numerical aperture (NA) of 0.41 when the full chip of the detector area is used. To minimize the thermal noise throughout data acquisition, the camera was cooled down to -60\u00a0\u00b0C.\nAll the microbial samples were scanned using the Fermat spiral scan grids [52]. For the IR scan on the A. nidulans sample (Fig.\u00a02a), the spiral grid was adjusted to fit the elongated geometry of the entire membrane. The scan step was set to 40\u00a0\u03bcm. The full chip of the detector was used to record the diffraction patterns. The CCD pixels were read out at a rate of 1\u00a0MHz and the on-chip binning was set to 4 \u00d7 4 to reduce the readout time. The IR scan with 850 scan positions and a FOV of about 0.9 mm2 took 62\u00a0min, mainly due to the slow readout of the employed CCD detector. Note that in the future recording such overview images will be feasible within a few seconds by combining commercially available rapid readout EUV sCMOS detectors [53] with the fly-scan method [54].\nFor the EUV scans on the individual ROIs (Fig.\u00a0 2b ~ f ) of A. nidulans and E. coli, the scan step between adjacent positions was chosen between 1 and 2\u00a0 \u03bcm, according to the requirements of the FOV. The on-chip binning of the detector was set to 2\u00d7 2 . The measured diffraction patterns were cropped from the full size, corresponding to 1024 \u00d7 1024 binned pixels, to either 512\u00d7 512 binned pixels or 256\u00d7 256 binned pixels, which reduces the effective NA to 0.2 or 0.1, depending on the particular measurement. A detailed table containing the settings of each measurement is shown in the supplement. For A. nidulans, two diffraction patterns with a short (0.3\u00a0s) and a long exposure time (4\u00a0s) were acquired for each scan position and combined into a single high dynamic range diffraction pattern. For E. coli, 119 EUV diffraction patterns were recorded with exposure times 0.3\u00a0s, 3\u00a0s, and 9\u00a0s, and fused into a single HDR pattern.\nFirst, the raw diffraction patterns were background subtracted. After these preprocessing procedures, the object and probe were reconstructed by standard ptychography reconstruction algorithms, which were performed using the GPU-accelerated package of ptylab [55]. An axial position calibration algorithm (zPIE [56]) was used to estimate the sampledetector distance. Subsequently, an accelerated gradient solver (mPIE [57]) was used to reconstruct the object and probe combined with the mixed-stated forward model [58] to account for mode de-coherence effects, such as high-frequency sample vibrations [59], background, detector point-spread, and a finite spectral bandwidth [60] in the illumination. To compensate for slow probe wavefront variations on a time scale longer than the exposure time, the orthogonal probe relaxation (OPR) method [61] was applied to all illumination modes, which is called mixed-state orthogonal probe relaxation (m-s OPR) [32]. For the quantitative analysis of A. nidulans and E. coli samples, four mixed states each consisting of 4 OPR modes were modeled, resulting in a total of 16 probe modes. The resulting\nreconstructions contain fewer artifacts and become more quantitatively reliable for the material composition analysis as compared to simpler forward models.\nScattering quotient and\u00a0scattering contrast analysis The atomic scattering factor f = f1 + if2 is tabulated for all elements and can be found in the literature for the EUV and X-ray spectral range up to 30 keV [48]. To calculate the atomic scattering factor \u2212 f = \u2212 f1 +i \u2212\nf2 for a compound (e.g., carbohydrate C6H10O5) the mean atomic scattering factor for the real and imaginary parts has to be calculated, which accounts for the stoichiometric weight si of all constituent elements [5].\nThe theoretical scattering quotient is subsequently given by the ratio of the resulting real and imaginary parts. Experimentally, the complex scattering quotient can be calculated from the reconstructed complex transmission function via the ratio of the unwrapped phase \u03d5 x, y and the natural logarithm of the reconstructed amplitude \u2223 \u2223O ( x, y )\u2223 \u2223\u00a0[20].\nSince ptychographic reconstructions are invariant to a scaling of the amplitude and global phase shift, the reconstructed complex transmission of the object is referenced to a known vacuum area, where an amplitude of unity and zero phase shift is assumed.\nSimilar to the scattering quotient, the scattering contrast [46] can be defined by\nwhere \u03b4and \u03b2 correspond to the deviation from the unity of the real and imaginary part of the refractive index n = 1\u2212 \u03b4 \u2212 i\u03b2 . Starting from the reconstructed amplitude \u2223 \u2223O ( x, y )\u2223 \u2223 and phase \u03d5 ( x, y )\n, the complex reconstruction can be converted to a real-valued image that combines phase and amplitude contrast\nwhere t ( x, y )\ncorresponds to the 2-dimensional thickness map of the sample. Comparing with the cross-section for elastic scattering [5] ( re corresponds to the classical electron radius)\n\u2212 f1= \u2211\ni\nsif1,i\n\u2212 f2= \u2211\ni\nsif2,i\n\u2212 fq=\n\u2212 f1 \u2212 f2 = \u03d5 ( x, y ) ln (\u2223 \u2223O ( x, y )\u2223 \u2223 )\nc =\n\u221a\n\u03b42 + \u03b22\n2\n\u03c8 ( x, y ) =\n\u221a\nln( \u2223 \u2223O ( x, y )\u2223 \u2223 2 + \u03d5 ( x, y )2 = 2\u03c0 \u2217 c \u2217 t(x, y)\n\u03c3el = 8\n3 \u2217 \u03c0r2e (f 2 1 + f 2 2 )\nit is evident that the calculated scattering contrast value c directly relates to the elastic scattering cross-section. Therefore, \u03c8(x, y) gives a measure for the total elastic scattering (i.e. diffraction) in each pixel integrated along the projection direction."

After coating it with 50\u00a0nm of copper (thermal evaporation) from the backside to support charge dissipation during the structuring process, a focused Ga + ion beam (FEI Helios G3 UC, 30\u00a0keV, 21 nA for IR mask, 230 pA for EUV mask) was scanned over the Si3N4 surface to etch the desired aperture through the membrane and the copper layer.
