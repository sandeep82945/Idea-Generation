Investigation of Temperature and Pressure Effects on Molecular Dynamics: While the current study provides detailed insights at specific temperatures, future research could focus on a broader range of temperatures and pressures. This would enable a deeper understanding of how these environmental factors influence the rotational dynamics, phase transitions, and the potential emergence of new phases or behaviors in PCNB and similar compounds.

Exploring the Role of Substituents on Molecular Flexibility and Dynamics: The high flexibility of the â€“NO2 group significantly impacts PCNB's dynamics. Systematically varying the substituents on the benzene ring could reveal the relationship between molecular structure and dynamic behavior. This approach could help identify structural features that enhance or constrain molecular motion, potentially leading to the design of materials with tailored properties.

Quantitative Analysis of Heterogeneous Versus Homogeneous Scenarios in Other Plastic Crystals: The findings suggest a homogeneous scenario for PCNB's plastic phase dynamics. Extending this analysis to other plastic crystals, particularly those with different molecular geometries or interaction potentials, could validate the universality of this observation. Comparative studies might uncover conditions under which a heterogeneous scenario might emerge, offering insights into the underlying mechanisms dictating molecular mobility.

Development of Advanced Simulation Techniques for Long-Term Dynamics: The current study leverages molecular dynamics simulations to elucidate short- and long-term dynamics. Future research could focus on developing or employing advanced simulation methodologies that can efficiently capture even longer-term dynamics with higher accuracy. Techniques such as accelerated dynamics simulations or machine learning-enhanced models could provide new insights into the stability, relaxation processes, and long-term behavior of plastic phases.

Experimental and Theoretical Studies on the Interaction Between Molecular Dynamics and Bulk Properties: Understanding the linkage between the microscopic dynamics of molecules in their plastic phases and the macroscopic properties of the material (such as mechanical strength, dielectric properties, and thermal conductivity) remains a critical challenge. Future research could aim to correlate detailed molecular motion studies with changes in bulk material properties, potentially leading to a predictive framework for designing materials with specific desired properties based on their dynamic molecular behavior.
