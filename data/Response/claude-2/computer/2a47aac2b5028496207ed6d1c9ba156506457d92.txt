 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading this paper on knowledgeable relation extraction:

1. Explore different strategies for integrating multiple knowledge bases into the system, such as weighting certain knowledge bases higher than others based on relevance. 

2. Develop methods to handle ambiguity when entities can map to multiple knowledge bases, rather than just taking the knowledge base with higher information content.

3. Experiment with more complex knowledge injection methods beyond just adding knowledge triples, such as integrating knowledge graph embeddings. 

4. Evaluate the impact of knowledge injection on model interpretability and explainability. Develop methods to trace back predictions to supporting knowledge.

5. Expand the approach to other relation extraction tasks and domains beyond biomedicine, such as general knowledge bases like Wikidata. Evaluate if knowledge injection consistently improves performance.
