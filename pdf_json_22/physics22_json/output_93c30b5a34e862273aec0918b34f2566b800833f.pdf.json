    "abstractText": "In this work, our focus is on exploring the potential of current GRB measurements to provide reliable constraints on cosmological model parameters at high redshift. This work is divided into two parts. First, we calibrate the Amati relation in a model-independent way by using Hubble parameter measurements obtained from the differential ages of the galaxies. We further check if the Amati relation parameters evolve with the GRBs\u2019 redshift or not, using the data of Old Astrophysical Objects. The results indicate that GRBs do seem to evolve with redshift. In the second part, we test different cosmological models with the calibrated GRB data obtained by using constant and dynamical Amati relation. Our results indicate that the present quality of GRB data is not good enough to put tight constraints on the cosmological parameters. Hence we perform a joint analysis with the combined data of GRBs and Type Ia Supernovae (SNe) and find that this can considerably enhance cosmological constraints in contrast to solely relying on GRBs.",

            "text": "Accelerated expansion of the universe is fairly well established now [1\u20134]. The simplest model consistent with the observations is the spatially flat \u039bCDM model, according to which the universe mostly consists of dark energy and dark matter, with baryonic matter being a small fraction. The nature of the dark sector is still unknown and hence it becomes important to analyse the different models with combinations of observational datasets. For this, several groups have been trying to explore new probes in cosmology. GRBs are one such tool which has the potential to explore the universe even at large redshift.\nGamma Ray Bursts (GRBs) are the most powerful explosions in the universe (with photon energies of the order of tens of keV to GeV) and are believed to form from the collapse of massive spinning stars [5]. On the basis of the burst duration,\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nGRBs are classified in two categories: Short GRBs and Long GRBs. The short GRBs usually last for less than 2 seconds while long GRBs can last from 2 seconds to several minutes [6]. Though the exact mechanism behind these high energy explosions is not very clear, it is believed that the short and long GRBs form from the mergers of the binary neutron stars and core collapse of supernovae respectively [7, 8].\nGRBs have been observed up to very high redshifts (z \u223c 9). Furthermore, the emission is unaffected by the intervening dust. Due to these reasons, GRBs can be considered a good candidate to study the universe at high redshifts. Keeping this in mind, several energy-luminosity correlations for GRBs have been proposed in the literature. The earliest correlation discovered by Amati et al., is known as the \u201cAmati Relation\u201d [9\u201312]. Other relations like the \u201cGhirlanda relation\u201d, \u201cYonetoku relation\u201d and \u201cLiang-Zhang relation\u201d were also proposed later that could make GRBs more suitable for standard candles [13\u201317]. Compared to these relations, the Amati relation has several advantages. First, it has a smaller scatter than the other relations, which means that it provides more accurate distance estimates. Second, it is easier to apply, as it only requires the measurement of two observables (Eiso and Ep) that can be obtained from the prompt gamma-ray emission spectrum, rather than the detection of afterglow emission that is often challenging to observe. Finally, the Amati relation has been tested using a larger sample of GRBs than the other relations, making it a more reliable calibration tool.\nThe Amati relation correlates the isotropic equivalent radiant energy (Eiso) with the spectral peak energy in the GRB rest frame (Ep). Isotropic equivalent radiant energy is related to the luminosity distance, (Eiso = 4\u03c0d2LS(1+ z)\n\u22121). Therefore, in order to calculate Eiso from the observed GRB prompt fluence (S), we need to first estimate the luminosity distance. However, due to the sparsity of GRBs at low redshift, one has to assume a cosmological model. This means that the Amati relation is calibrated by assuming a cosmological model and a \u201cCircularity Problem\u201d is introduced if the same data is used to constrain the cosmological parameters. Apart from this, the Amati relation has also faced the extrinsic scatter problem. However, with better data, the scatter in the data has reduced and the relation has become more realistic.\nTo overcome the circularity issue in the Amati relation, various methods have been proposed in the literature. Some authors have used the GRB data with the H(z) and BAO data to determine the cosmological and GRB correlation parameters simultaneously [18, 19]. In another approach, several ancillary probes have been used to determine the luminosity distance in a model independent way. For example, authors have used Type Ia SNe data to calibrate the distance modulus of GRBs [20\u201324]. Observational Hubble data points have been used in literature to calibrate the Amati relation and approximate the cosmic evolution through a Bezier parametric curve [18, 25\u201328]. In a recent work, the angular diameter distances from galaxy clusters have been used to calibrate the Amati relation at low redshifts [29].\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nAfter the establishment of GRBs occurring at cosmological distances, various endeavors have been made to utilize GRB correlations to constrain cosmological parameters [16, 30\u201335]. Such as an updated Ep \u2212 Eiso correlation, using a cosmographic approach, has more recently been employed to put bound on cosmological parameters from a dataset of GRBs [36]. Further, in their study, M. Demianski et al. (2019) employed the Ep \u2212 Eiso correlation and incorporated potential changes in GRB observables to conclude that a scalar field with an exponential potential energy density describes a dynamical dark energy model that is consistent with calibrated GRB, Type Ia SNe, and H(z) data [37]. In a recent study by N. Khadka et al (2021), they employed the Amati relation to obtain constraints on both the correlation and cosmological model parameters [38]. S. Cao et al. (2022) utilized the A220 and A118 GRB samples [39, 40], along with the Dainotti-correlated GRB data sets compiled by J. P. Hu et al. (2021) [41] and F. Y. Wang et al (2022) [17], to constrain cosmological model parameters by employing the Amati relation. On the other hand, people proposed improved versions of the Amati relation that incorporate a redshift-dependent term [20, 42]. To achieve this, they utilized a powerful statistical tool called copula.\nIn this context, there are two objectives of this work. In the first part, a constant Amati relation, with coefficients that do not depend on redshift, is calibrated without employing any cosmological model. For this, we use the Gaussian process to reconstruct the luminosity distance from the Hubble parameter measurements obtained from the differential ages of galaxies. Further, to check if the Amati relation parameters evolve with the GRBs\u2019 redshift, we divide the GRBs in five different redshift bins. For this, we use Old Astrophysical Objects (OAO) data and fit a third order polynomial with it. We then determine the luminosity distance using the derivative of the polynomial. It is important to note that in this way we study evolution of the Amati relation with redshift without adopting any background cosmological model.\nAfter calibration of GRBs, in the second part, we use the constant Amati relation as well as the dynamical Amati relation with full GRBs data and determine the bounds on cosmological parameters of different models. In this work, we use three cosmological models: i). \u039bCDM model, ii). q(z) parametrizations, and iii). ztCDM model. To study these models, we first adopt the GRB data and then perform a joint analysis with combined data of GRBs and Type Ia SNe.\nThe paper is organized as follows. We describe the data set and our methodology in Section 2 and Section 3 respectively. Results are discussed in Section 4. Finally in Section 5, we discuss the final outcome of both parts along with the conclusions.\n\u2013 3 \u2013"

            "text": "We use the Hubble data to estimate the luminosity distance for GRBs calibration. In this work, we use H(z) data from the differential ages of passively evolving galaxies. For a FLRW metric, H(z) can be expressed as\nH(z) = \u2212 1 (1 + z) dz dt\n(2.1)\nIt becomes essential to take proper care when using the differential age approach to estimate H(z). With spectroscopy of extragalactic objects, redshift measurement is possible upto an accuracy of \u03b4z/z < 10\u22123 but measurement of dt is crucial. To estimate dt various methods like full spectrum fitting, absorption feature analysis and calibration of specific spectroscopic features are used [45\u201347]. One of the important issues while using this approach is the degeneracy between the age-metallicity and age-star formation history. To overcome this, passively evolving red galaxies are used. It is assumed that the star formation in such galaxies has been quenched and hence their spectra are dominated by the older stellar population [48]. The measurement of differential age minimizes the systematics that could be there if we measure the absolute age. Measurement of H(z) in this way does not rely on any cosmological model and is purely spectroscopic, making it a strong candidate to check the viability of, and assumptions behind, any cosmological model. Recently, Mag\u0303an et. al (2018) compiled a dataset consisting of 31 datapoints which were measurements of H(z) using differential ages of passively evolving galaxies [49]. For our work, we have used 32 Hubble measurements that includes 31 from the Mag\u0303an et. al (2018) compilation and one additional data point compiled by Borghi et al. (2022) at z = 0.75 [50].

In the analysis of Type Ia supernovae, the distance modulus (\u00b5SNe) is the standard observable quantity, which represents the difference between the apparent and absolute magnitude of the supernovae. For luminosity distance, we use the Pantheon dataset of Type Ia supernovae, which includes 1048 data points within a redshift range of 0.01 \u2264 z \u2264 2.26 [52]. The relationship that defines the observable measurement is expressed as\n\u00b5SNe(z) = mB(z) + \u03b1 \u00b7 X1 \u2212 \u03b2 \u00b7 C \u2212 MB. (2.2)\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nwhere mB is the rest frame B-band peak magnitude, MB represents absolute B-band magnitude of a fiducial Type Ia SNe with X1 = 0 and C = 0. Here X1 and C represent the time stretch of light curve and supernova colour at maximum brightness respectively. In the Pantheon sample, the stretch-luminosity parameter (\u03b1) and the color-luminosity parameter (\u03b2) have been calibrated to zero, resulting in only two remaining parameters. As a result, the distance modulus can be expressed as\n\u00b5SNe(z) = mB(z)\u2212 MB. (2.3) Furthermore, by obtaining the distance modulus, we can estimate both the lu-\nminosity distance (dL) and the uncertainty in the luminosity distance (\u03c3dL) for each Type Ia supernova as\ndL(z) = 10(mB\u2212MB\u221225)/5 (Mpc), \u03c3dL = ln(10)\n5 dL\u03c3mB (Mpc) (2.4)\nAs indicated by Eq. (2.4), determining the value of MB allows us to calculate the luminosity distance at a specific redshift. Recent research suggests that the luminosity (or absolute magnitude) of Type Ia supernovae does not evolve with redshift [53, 54]. So, it is generally accepted that the Type Ia supernovae sample is normally distributed with a mean absolute magnitude of MB = \u221219.22 [55]. However, in this work we take both H0 and MB as free parameters since fixing one of them indirectly determines the other parameter."

For this, we first estimate the comoving distance from the Hubble parameter measurements in the redshift range 0 < z < 2. We apply Gaussian Process (GP) to obtain a continuous smooth curve of H(z) and after integrating the H(z) values we get the corresponding comoving distances (dC). GP is a well known hyper-parametric regression method which aims to reconstruct the shapes of physical functions from data without assuming a parametrized form of the function [56]. GP has been extensively used and because of its flexibility and simplicity, it is very useful for functional reconstructions. For example, from a set of measurements, we have H(z) values and the uncertainty, i.e. H(zi)\u00b1 \u03c3H, where the value of H(zi) follows a Gaussian distribution at every point of zi. Suppose, at an unknown point z\u2032, we want to estimate the value of the function. For this, we have a covariance or kernel function k(z, z\u2032) which indicates that the value of the function at z is not independent of its value at z\u2032 but instead the values are correlated by the kernel function.\nGaussian Process is a non-parametric technique because it only depends on the choice of the covariance function and not on model parameters or any assumed functional form. The covariance function often depends on the separation |z \u2212 z\u2032|\n\u2013 6 \u2013\nbetween the points. In this analysis, we consider the Squared Exponential or Gaussian kernel function [47, 57] since this function has the characteristic of being infinitely differentiable, which is important for reconstructing a derivative of a function. The Squared Exponential kernel function is\nk ( z, z\u2032 ) = \u03c32f exp ( \u2212 (z \u2212 z \u2032)2\n2\u21132\n) (3.1)\nwhere \u03c3f and \u2113 are the GP hyperparameters which basically regulate the correlationstrength of the function value and the length scale of the correlation in z respectively. Using the observed data, one can estimate the value of \u03c3f and \u2113 parameters by minimizing a log marginal likelihood function. For maximization, we use flat priors for the \u03c3f and \u2113 parameters of the kernel function.\nOnce we get the reconstructed H(z) in the required redshift range, 0 < z < 2, we use the Simpson 38 method for numerical integration of 1/H(z) to obtain continuous values of dC in the same redshift range as\ndC(z) = \u222b z\n0\nc\u0303dz\u2032\nH(z\u2032) (3.2)\nwhere c\u0303 is speed of light.\nFinally, to obtain luminosity distance we use dL = (1 + z)dC. The corresponding uncertainties are obtained by propagating the error obtained in dC using Gaussian Process as shown in Figure 2. The dL obtained by this method is then used with Sbolo given in the GRB data to calculate Eiso. It is important to note that only 118 data points lying in the redshift range 0 < z < 2 of A220 data are considered for this purpose as the Hubble data used here also lie in this redshift range."

In this analysis, the parameters are collectively denoted by the symbol P.\n\u2022 \u039bCDM Model: In this model, the universe is spatially flat and the matter density (baryonic and dark matter), as determined by the Planck result, contributes approximately 31.47 \u00b1 0.74% to the total energy density of the universe. The rest of the contribution comes from dark energy [59]. This model is in concordance with most of the observations and hence it is widely accepted. In a flat universe, the Hubble parameter for the \u039bCDM model is given as\nH(z, P) = H0 \u221a \u2126m0(1 + z)3 + (1 \u2212 \u2126m0)\n\u2022 q(z) Parametrizations: In this analysis, we consider three different parametrizations of q(z), one with one parameter and two with two parameters. Corresponding to each parametrization, one can determine expression for Hubble parameter using the following equation\nH(z, P) = H0 exp [\u222b z\n0\n1 + q(x) 1 + x\ndx ]\n. The three parametrizations are :\n\u2013 P1: q(z) = q0; This parametrization is motivated by the fact that a value less than 0 is indicative of recent acceleration without reference to any particular dark energy model [60].\n\u2013 P2: q(z) = q0 + q1z; This continuous and smooth linear parametrization gives the value of deceleration parameter at z = 0 while at higher redshifts it diverges [61].\n\u2013 P3: q(z) = q0 + q1 z\n1 + z ; This parametrization is better than the P2 parametriza-\ntion as it behaves well at high redshifts while the linear approach diverges in the distant past [62].\n\u2013 9 \u2013\n\u2022 ztCDM Model: If we use the condition a\u0308 = 0 in the \u039bCDM model, we obtain an expression for the transition redshift,\nzt = (\n2\u2126\u039b0 \u2126m0\n)1/3 \u2212 1\nSubstituting for zt in the flat \u039bCDM model gives us [63, 64].\nH(z, P) = H0\n\u221a (1 + z)3\n0.5(1 + zt)3 + 1 +\n(1 + zt)3\n(1 + zt)3 + 2\nWe have assumed a spatially flat cosmology as the background for all the models mentioned above. Considering these Hubble functions, the theoretical value of the luminosity distance can be obtained from\ndL(z, P) = c\u0303(1 + z) \u222b z\n0\n1 H(z\u2032; P) dz\u2032 (3.12)\nwhere c\u0303 is the velocity of light. Using Eq. (3.12), we finally estimate the theoretical distance modulus as\n\u00b5th(z, P) = 5 log (\ndL(z; P) 1 Mpc\n) + 25 (3.13)\nBy utilizing GRB data at 0.03 < z < 8.2, we fit the cosmological parameters using the \u03c72 minimization technique as\n\u03c72GRB = NG\n\u2211 i=1\n[ \u00b5GRB (zi)\u2212 \u00b5th (zi; P)\n\u03c3\u00b5GRB(zi)\n]2 (3.14)\nHere NG = 220 denotes the total number of GRB datapoints.\nIn addition to incorporating the GRBs, we also include the Pantheon database of Type Ia SNe. This data is useful for obtaining bounds on cosmological parameters and distinguishing between models of dark energy. Using Eqs. (2.3, 3.13) the \u03c72 for this database is defined as\n\u03c72SNe = NS\n\u2211 i=1\n[ \u00b5SNe (zi)\u2212 \u00b5th (zi; P)\n\u03c3\u00b5SNe(zi)\n]2 (3.15)\nwhere, NS denotes the total number of Type Ia SNe.\nThus, the total \u03c72T of GRBs and Type Ia SNe is\n\u03c72T = \u03c7 2 GRB + \u03c7 2 SNe (3.16)\n\u2013 10 \u2013\nIn this analysis, we employ the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis using emcee, a Python package introduced by Foreman-Mackey and colleagues in 2013 [65]. After executing the MCMC method to obtain the best fit for all parameters, we determine the confidence levels and their corresponding 1\u03c3, 2\u03c3, and 3\u03c3 uncertainties using the corner Python package [66]. For this work, we adopt a wide, uniform prior for all parameters as shown in Table 1."

            "text": "As stated earlier, the main aim of this work is to calibrate the GRBs in a modelindependent manner and then use it to put constraints on cosmological parameters. We calibrate the Amati relation which correlates the isotropic equivalent radiant energy (Eiso) and the spectral peak energy in the GRB rest frame (Ep). The circularity issue that arises due to the lack of GRBs at low redshift has motivated several\n\u2013 25 \u2013\nauthors to come up with model-independent approaches to calibrate this relation. In order to alleviate this problem, it has been proposed that the Type Ia SNe data available in redshift range of GRBs can be used to calibrate luminosity correlations of GRBs [21, 71]. It is assumed that the objects at the same redshift should have the same luminosity distance in any cosmology; hence the luminosity distance of the Type Ia SNe can be assigned to the GRBs existing at the same redshift or various model independent methods can be used to obtain dL vs z plot. But the lack of Type Ia SNe beyond z \u223c 2 makes it hard to calibrate the correlation at high redshift. One can only calibrate the relation for low redshift GRBs and extend it to high redshift. In the process of doing so, one has to make an assumption that the GRBs correlation is not evolving with redshift. As most of the GRBs are available at high redshifts, it becomes crucial to test this hypothesis. For this reason, cosmologists have been trying to test this relation with various data sets and methods.\nL. Amati et al. proposed a novel technique to determine dL from the H(z) data in a model independent way. They approximated the Hubble function corresponding to the OHD data points using a Bezier parametric curve obtained from a linear combination of Bernstein basis polynomials [18]. This approach was also used in literature along with the enlarged Hubble data generated using various machine learning tools and BAO data to investigate the correlation [25, 72]. In a recent work, a model independent approach has been used to constrain the Amati relation parameters and the intrinsic scatter [29]. The authors used a non-parametric technique on the Galaxy cluster data to obtain dA corresponding to the GRBs redshift which is further used to determine dL assuming CDDR to be valid. Recently, N. Liang et al. (2022) calibrated the Amati relation of GRBs using Gaussian Process with the Type Ia SNe data. They obtain GRB Hubble diagram with the A219 and A118 samples of GRB and used it to test \u039bCDM and \u03c9CDM models [24]. Z. Li et al also used GRB data to compare dark energy models [73].\nWe divide this work into two parts as follows.\nPart I. Calibration of Gamma Ray Bursts\nIn this work, we use a non-parametric technique (Gaussian Process) to obtain the dL as a function of z from the Hubble data having 32 data points of Hubble parameter obtained from the differential age of the galaxies in the redshift range 0.0 < z < 2.0. We use this luminosity distance and the bolometric fluence Sbolo, given in the GRB data, to calculate the bolometric isotropic equivalent radiant energy of GRBs (Eiso) upto z \u2264 2. Further, the spectral peak energy (Ep) of the GRBs along with the Eiso is used to put constraints on the Amati relation parameters and the intrinsic scatter. We believe that our work is advantageous over the earlier works for the following reasons:\n\u2022 We use H(z) data obtained from the differential age of galaxies that does not rely on any cosmological assumption other than homogeneity and isotropy. In\n\u2013 26 \u2013\nearlier work, a functional form of H(z) (Bezier Polynomial) was used to obtain dL from H(z) data. This method was applied to calibrate the Amati relation. However in our work, we obtain dL using a non-parametric technique, namely Gaussian Process. Figure 2 shows the variation of dL with redshift obtained on application of the Gaussian Process on the H(z) data. This plot provides us the dL values at z corresponding to the GRB data upto z \u223c 2. The 1\u03c3, 2\u03c3 and 3\u03c3 contours of the Amati relation parameters and intrinsic scatter along with their best fit values are shown in Figure 3. We find that our results are in good concordance with the recent work in which authors have used galaxy cluster data to constrain the Amati relation parameters (See Table 2).\n\u2022 Recently N. Liang et al. used GP with Type Ia SNe data till redshift z < 1.4 [24] and G. Govindaraj et al. with Galaxy cluster data upto z < 0.9 [29], to calibrate the Amati relation. In the latter, authors have to assume that the Cosmic Distance Duality Relation (CDDR) is valid to get the luminosity distance from the dA obtained from Galaxy cluster data. It is important to note that we do not make any such cosmological assumption in this work and hence making our analysis purely model independent. Also H(z) data is in redshift range 0 < z < 2 making it possible to test the validity of correlation upto comparatively higher redshift which is very crucial as most of the GRBs exist at high redshift. Another point to note is that by using this method, the errors in the parameters are smaller than the errors obtained by using the Galaxy Cluster data method as can be seen from Table 2.\n\u2022 Further, in order to examine whether the Amati relation varies with cosmological redshift, we follow the technique of [67]. We divide the sample of 200 GRBs out of 220 GRBs into five groups up to redshift 3.85. To clarify, we arrange the GRBs according to their redshifts and distribute them into five bins based on a low-to-high range of redshift values with each bin having 40 GRBs. We then calibrate the Amati relation in each group and estimate the Amati relation parameters at the mean redshift <z> of given bin. For this, we use the data of old astrophysical objects and fit a third order polynomial to estimate the luminosity distance. Once we obtain the Amati relation parameters, i.e., m and c of each bin, we linear fit to m \u2212<z> and c \u2212<z>. By analyzing the plot of m \u2212<z> and c \u2212<z>, we find that m and c strongly evolve with the redshift which indicates the evolution of GRBs with the cosmological redshift. L. Li (2007) also used the same methodology to study the redshift variation of Amati relation with 48 GRBs only and concluded that GRBs evolve with the cosmological redshift [67].\nPart II. Cosmological Parameters Estimation\nDue to their high luminosity, GRBs have the potential to serve as alternate probes to Type Ia SNe for studying the evolution of the universe. After the observations of GRBs occurring at cosmological distances, various attempts have been made to\n\u2013 27 \u2013\nuse GRBs correlations to constrain cosmological models. In a recent study [38], the Amati relation is employed to obtain constraints on both the correlation and cosmological model parameters. In their work, they focused on spatially-flat or non-flat \u039bCDM, XCDM, \u03d5CDM models and put constraints on these models by using GRB data alone as well as the combined data of GRBs with BAO and H(z). Similar work has also been carried by [24], where they calibrated the Amati relation using Type Ia SNe and investigate cosmology by adopting a joint analysis with GRBs and H(z) datasets.\nAfter calibrating GRBs from Part-I, in this part, we use the constant Amati relation as well as the dynamical Amati relation and study different cosmological models. In this work, we use three cosmological models: \u039bCDM, q(z) parametrization, and ztCDM models. Till now, only \u039bCDM, \u03d5CDM and XCDM models have been studied with GRBs. In this work, we have extended the previous work by using different models, viz., q(z) parametrization and ztCDM models. In these two models, we study the deceleration parameter (q(z)) and transition redshift (zt) and put constraints on these parameters. Another notable point is that the constraints obtained earlier on cosmological parameters are carried out by using constant Amati relation only. In the present work, along with constant Amati relation, we test the impact of dynamical Amati relation on cosmological parameters of different cosmological models. Finally, we also test these cosmological models with a joint analysis of GRBs and Type Ia SNe datasets.\nA brief summary of the results is as follows:\n\u2022 \u039bCDM Model:\n\u2013 GRB data: The bounds on H0 and \u2126m0 are very weak as the error bars are quite large in both the cases, i.e, constant and dynamical m and c. It is observed that the dynamical m & c supports a higher value of matter density.\n\u2013 GRB+Type Ia SNe data: A joint analysis of the GRBs+Type Ia SNe provides more restrictive or tighter constraints on \u2126m0 compared to the constraints from the GRBs data alone. Our analysis shows that the obtained value of \u2126m0 is consistent with the value obtained from the Type Ia SNe analysis [52].\n\u2022 q(z) Parametrizations: In this model, we consider three different parametrizations of the deceleration parameter.\n\u2013 GRB data: In all the parametrizations, it is observed that error bars on the model parameters (qi and H0) are reduced when we work with the dynamical Amati relation.\n\u2013 GRB+Type Ia SNe data: Combining GRB data with Type Ia SNe data gives tighter constraints on all coefficients of the three parametrizations and we get a well constrained value for all model parameters (with both the constant and dynamical Amati parameters).\n\u2013 28 \u2013\nIn all the parametrizations of q(z), we find a negative value of q0. This negative value suggests that the cosmic expansion is accelerating, which is the case in the current era of the universe. This is consistent with the observations of distant supernovae and the cosmic microwave background radiation, which indicate that the expansion of the universe is accelerating [1, 2].\n\u2022 ztCDM Model: In this model, we attempt to put constraints on the transition redshift, zt.\n\u2013 GRB data: On comparing results for constant and dynamical m & c relation, we find that zt decreases marginally.\n\u2013 GRB+Type Ia SNe data: Combining GRB data with Type Ia SNe leads to a tighter constraint on zt \u223c 0.7, which is in concordance with the obtained value of zt from different datasets [68\u201370]. Also the constrained value of zt remains same for both the cases (constant and dynamical m & c).\n\u2022 If one were to conduct an analysis of GRBs+Type Ia SNe, the value of H0, which represents the current expansion rate of the universe and (MB), the absolute magnitude of the supernova, would be free parameters to be determined. As expected in all the models, H0 and MB show correlated behaviour. We also observe that there is very mild variation or no change in the model parameters (qi, \u2126m0 & zt) values when we compare the results obtained from constant m & c with the dynamical relation. The error bars on model parameters reduce significantly when we work with GRB+Type Ia SNe.\nThe aforementioned evolutionary effect in GRB correlations is still under debate and several groups have been investigating the relation with different techniques and datasets [67, 74\u201378]. Lin et al. reported reasonable evidence of evolution with redshift for four relations and Wang et al. also found the same result for the Amati relation [32, 79]. However some authors have claimed that there is no redshift evolution in the Amati relation [36, 38, 80]. As a result, it becomes important to further examine the GRB relation in order to consider GRBs as standard candles. For that reason, the Space-based multiband astronomical Variable Objects Monitor (SVOM), a Sino-French mission which is expected to be launched in the middle of 2023 and is intended to study Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) is of great importance [81]. Another space mission, Transient High Energy Sky and Early Universe Surveyor (THESEUS) is planned to be launched in 2032 [82]. It aims to exploit the high redshift Gamma Ray Bursts in order to explore the early universe. In light of these next generation missions, it is expected that we would have data that could provide better insight on the use of GRBs as standard candles."
