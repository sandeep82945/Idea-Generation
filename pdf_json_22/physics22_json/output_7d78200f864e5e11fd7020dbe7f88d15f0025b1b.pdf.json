The device is matched to the 50 \u2126 environment with a Klopfensteintaper impedance transformer and achieves a bandwidth of 250-300 MHz, with input saturation powers up to \u221295 dBm at 20 dB gain. A 54-qubit Sycamore processor was used to benchmark these devices, providing a calibration for readout power, an estimate of amplifier added noise, and a platform for comparison against standard impedance matched parametric amplifiers with a single dc-SQUID. We find that the high power rf-SQUID array design has no adverse effect on system noise, readout fidelity, or qubit dephasing, and we estimate an upper bound on amplifier added noise at 1.6 times the quantum limit. Lastly, amplifiers with this design show no degradation in readout fidelity due to gain compression, which can occur in multi-tone multiplexed readout with traditional JPAs.\nDispersive readout1 of superconducting qubits requires the use of near quantum limited superconducting amplifiers because of the severe limits placed by the quantum system on the allowed microwave probe power2. Resonant Josephson parametric amplifiers (JPA) have been popular in single qubit readout as they provide high gain, quantum-limited noise performance, tunable center frequency3\u20136, and are simple to manufacture. However, larger quantum processors typically multiplex qubit measurement in the frequency domain, transmitting and receiving multiple probe tones using the same readout line7. This configuration requires a first stage amplifier with higher bandwidth and saturation power than the typical JPAs can provide.\nThe instantaneous bandwidth of resonant JPAs can be increased using impedance matching techniques8\u201311, but their input saturation power remains low,\u2212115 dBm to\u2212110 dBm. High dynamic range JPAs using SQUID arrays have been demonstrated12,13, but while improving the input saturation\na)Authors to whom correspondence should be addressed: tcwhite@google.com and ofernaaman@google.com\npower up to \u221295 dBm, they still suffer from relatively narrow bandwidths, less than 200 MHz. Traveling wave parametric amplifiers (TWPA) can provide bandwidths in excess of 2 GHz and high saturation power14\u201318, but are difficult to fabricate and typically have lower quantum efficiency than JPAs due to higher dissipative and intermodulation losses19. Practical systems considerations, such as qubit frequency placement plan20, Purcell filter bandwidth21, and mixer IF bandwidth7, can additionally prevent the full utilization of the TWPAs multi-GHz bandwidth.\nHere, we demonstrate a resonant Josephson parametric amplifier that achieves the bandwidth performance of a matched JPA8 and a hundred-fold increase in saturation power. The amplifier design is based on the impedance matched parametric amplifier (IMPA)8, which is in widespread use in our lab for frequency multiplexed readout. Unlike the IMPA, and indeed most JPA implementations, in which the amplifier\u2019s nonlinear inductance is provided by a single dc-SQUID (with critical currents of order of a few \u00b5A), the amplifiers presented in this Letter use arrays of high critical current rf-SQUIDs13. The substitution of an rf-SQUID array for each of the junctions in the JPA SQUID increases the saturation power of\nar X\niv :2\n20 9.\n07 75\n7v 2\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n2 3\nN ov\n2 02\n2\n2\nthe amplifier while keeping the total inductance of the device roughly the same.\nFigure. 1(a) shows a simplified diagram of the amplifier. The nonlinear inductance is composed of two rf-SQUID arrays arranged in parallel to form a compound SQUID13, with a total of 2N = 40 unit cells. Each rf-SQUID consists of a junction with a critical current Ic, and a linear inductance composed of two segments with inductance L1 and one segment with inductance L2. The L1 segments are shared between neighboring rf-SQUIDs, so that the structure as a whole forms a serpentine inductive spine of alternating L1 and L2, bridged by Josephson junctions at each meander. We will refer to this structure as the \u2018snake\u2019, and to the amplifier as a whole as \u2018snake-IMPA\u2018 or \u2018SNIMPA\u2019 for short. The parallel arrangement of the arrays enables us to flux-bias and pump the amplifier via a single superconducting split-coil spiral transformer as shown in the figure. The transformer primary coils are connected in parallel paths between the bias feedline and ground. The secondary coils are counter-wound to primarily couple the bias to the circulating current mode (Iloop in the figure) of the compound SQUID loop formed by the two parallel portions of the snake (see Supplementary Material). The transformer mutual inductance is M \u2248 50 pH, and the self-inductance of the secondary coil is \u2248 120 pH. Finally, the structure is shunted by a capacitor Cs, and is connected to the 50\u2126 signal port via a Klopfenstein taper as in Ref. 8. An optical micrograph of the shunt capacitor, compound snake-\nSQUID, and bias transformer is shown in Fig. 1(b). The resonance frequency of the nonlinear circuit created\nby the capacitively-shunted snake is \u03c9res = 1/ \u221a\n(Ls +Lb)Cs, where Ls is given by13,22 (see Supplementary Material)\nLs = N 2 \u00d7 LJ(L1 +L2)+L1L2 cos\u03b40 LJ +(4L1 +L2)cos\u03b40 , (1)\nLJ = h\u0304/2eIc, and \u03b40 is the equilibrium junction phase, which is dependent on the flux bias13,22. Lb is a stray inductance that includes a contribution from the bias transformer selfinductance. The calculated resonance frequency for typical circuit parameters is shown in Fig. 1(c) as a function of applied flux bias per junction (or per rf-SQUID) in the array.\nTo avoid hysteresis in the modulation curve, the snake must be designed such that LJ > 4L1 +L2. This means that, unlike a conventional dc-SQUID, the inductance of a snake-SQUID does not diverge at \u03a60/2. Therefore \u03c9res has a limited tunability range compared to conventional JPAs, as seen in Fig. 1(c). We therefore choose the shunt capacitance Cs such that the frequency tunability range overlaps the desired operating frequency of the amplifier, 4.5-5.0 GHz. The device is fluxpumped at frequency \u03c9P, which is twice the center frequency of the amplifier.\nHere, we report on amplifiers having two design variants. The first, Design 1, has a nominal junction Ic = 16 \u00b5A and a shunt capacitance of Cs = 6.5 pF, and the second, Design 2, has a nominal Ic = 18 \u00b5A and Cs = 6.0 pF. Both designs have nominal snake inductances of L1 = 2.6 pH and L2 = 8.0 pH. From measurement of test junctions, we estimate that the actual critical current of the snake junctions is \u2248 20% lower than designed. The Klopfenstein taper that matches the low impedance SNIMPA resonator to the 50\u2126 signal port is similar to that reported in Ref. 8, with a cutoff frequency of 2.6 GHz and a 50-section taper from 51\u2126 to 24\u2126, resulting in a resonator loaded Q of about 4.5. The devices were built in a three-layer aluminum process with SiOx interlayer dielectrics and Al/AlOx/Al trilayer Josephson junctions. The first metal layer was used as a solid ground plane under the snake structure, and the upper two layers form the circuit elements of the amplifier (see Supplementary Material). In operation, the amplifiers\u2019 dc flux bias amounts to approximately 320 \u00b5A carried in each of the bias transformer primary coils, well below the measured critical current of traces and vias in our process.\nWe have characterized the performance of the SNIMPA devices with a 54-qubit Sycamore processor7. The processor consists of nine independent readout lines, each with six frequency-multiplexed readout resonators occupying a 4.6- 4.8 GHz band. Each readout line has an on-chip Purcell filter21, and is connected to a SNIMPA amplifier through four circulators. The readout resonators and Purcell filters were designed with a target resonator ringdown time of 1/\u03ba = 25 ns. The readout lines are labeled A through I; lines A, C, E, and G had a SNIMPA with Design 1, and the rest had Design 2. All SNIMPA were packaged with a magnetic shield. In a separate cooldown, all readout lines were outfitted with standard dc-SQUID based IMPA, whose performance we use as a baseline for comparison.\n3\nFigure. 2(a) shows the SNIMPA gain vs signal frequency (blue lines) on all readout lines as labeled. Each curve was measured at low power with a vector network analyzer, after manual tuneup of the amplifier\u2019s flux bias, pump frequency, and pump power. The frequencies of the readout resonators associated with each line are indicated by the vertical dashed lines (red). All amplifiers achieve gains greater than 15 dB over the entire readout band, and most resonators can be read out with a gain exceeding 20 dB. The gain profile is not Lorentzian; this is because the complex impedance seen by the SNIMPA nonlinear resonator varies over the amplifier band8. The multi-peak response is commonly seen in wider band parametric amplifiers8,23,24, but impedance matching network synthesis techniques could be used to achieve better control of gain flatness and ripple11.\nFor the purpose of the present experiments we were focused on isolated qubit readout performance. In some cases, we allowed the center frequency of the amplifier to reside within the\nresonator band (e.g. line H). In simultaneous multi-qubit readout with degenerate parametric amplifiers, in which the signal (at frequency \u03c9s) and idler (at \u03c9i = \u03c9P\u2212\u03c9s) share the same physical circuit, this can cause interference between a signal from one of the resonators and an idler generated by the readout of another. Therefore, in simultaneous multi-qubit readout, the pump should be tuned such that all readout resonator frequencies reside either below or above \u03c9P/2, meaning that only half the bandwidth is usefully available in practice.\nFigure 2(b) shows the input (squares) and output (circles) saturation power (1-dB gain compression) of each of the amplifiers, as a function of absolute signal detuning from the amplifier center frequency (half the pump frequency, \u03c9P/4\u03c0). The crosses in Fig. 2(a) denote the frequency and gain at which each point was measured. For this experiment we calibrate the signal power at the processor reference plane using ac Stark shift of the processor qubits. We first measure the dispersive shift \u03c7 = (\u03c9r,|0\u3009\u2212\u03c9r,|1\u3009)/2 (where \u03c9r,|0\u3009 and \u03c9r,|1\u3009 are the dressed resonance frequencies), and the resonator decay rate \u03ba spectroscopically for each qubit in our processor. From the ac Stark shift, which is given (in the lin-\n4\near regime) by \u03b4\u03c901 = \u22122\u03c7 n\u0304, we extract n\u0304, the average resonator photon occupation for a given combination of resonator drive power and frequency25. From the measured values of \u03ba and n\u0304 we calculate the microwave power impinging on the resonator26. Repeating this measurement at varying powers from the room-temperature signal generator allows us to calibrate the power delivered to the chip as a function of signal generator power. Figure 2(b) shows that the SNIMPA consistently achieve output saturation powers in the \u221280 dBm to \u221270 dBm range, up to 20 dB higher than our standard dcSQUID based IMPA. While output saturation power, being ideally gain-independent, is the more fundamental quantity, the figure also reports the input saturation power to allow a more direct comparison with the bulk of the existing literature.\nWe do not measure the amplifier added noise directly. Instead, we focus on the overall readout efficiency27, \u03b7 , which is a more relevant metric from a systems performance perspective (see Supplementary Material). Readout efficiency encapsulates all microwave losses, \u03b1 , between the readout resonators and the SNIMPA, as well as the noise temperature of the SNIMPA itself, Tp, and the effective noise temperature, Th, of the cryogenic HEMT amplifier and the rest of the measurement chain following the SNIMPA. Since our amplifiers are operated in a phase preserving mode, the maximum possible efficiency is \u03b7 = 0.5.\nFig. 3(a) shows the measured readout efficiency for all qubits in our Sycamore processor. The empirical cumulative\ndistribution function of these data is shown in the main plot, with a median of \u03b7 = 0.2 corresponding to a system noise temperature of TN,sys = 560 mK. The inset shows how these efficiencies are distributed across the qubit grid.\nWe measure the readout efficiency, \u03b7 , and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gain, GSNR, as a function of SNIMPA power gain, Gp, for all qubits in our processor:\nGSNR = Gp (TQ +Th)\nGpTQ +(Gp\u22121)Tp +Th (2)\n\u03b7 = \u03b1GpTQ\nGpTQ +(Gp\u22121)Tp +Th , (3)\nwhere TQ = h\u0304\u03c9/2k is the quantum noise at the readout frequency, and fit the data with both equations simultaneously. Since these fits cannot separate out contributions from \u03b1 and Tp, we have to fix one of these parameters. If the SNIMPA were quantum limited and we fix Tp = TQ, then fits to our data suggest an average insertion loss of \u03b1 = 0.44\u00b1 0.03, or \u22123.57 dB, between the processor chip and the SNIMPA.\nIndependent, cryogenically calibrated28 measurements of individual component losses (circulators and wiring) add up to a minimum of \u22122.5 dB of loss between the processor chip and the SNIMPA (see Supplementary Material). If we therefore fix \u03b1 = 0.56 (\u22122.5 dB) in the fits, then we can extract a maximum SNIMPA noise temperature, Tp = 0.18\u00b10.02 K, roughly 60% higher than the quantum limit. A cryogenically calibrated measurement of a representative integrated readout\n5 assembly shows an insertion loss that varies between\u22123.6 dB and\u22122.7 dB over the readout band (see Supplementary Material). These data put bounds on the average noise performance of the SNIMPA, as deployed, in the context of qubit readout of our processor. The data suggest that after accounting for component losses, the measured efficiencies are consistent with near quantum limited noise performance of the SNIMPA amplifiers.\nA potential concern with the SNIMPA is that the snake inductor could increase back action on the qubit, compared to the standard dc-SQUID based amplifiers. This could be due to coupling of noise photons through the large bias transformer, pump leakage to the signal line, or the generation of spurious signals or noise during amplification. Figure 3(b) shows qubit dephasing time, T\u03c6 , as measured using the CPMG (Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gill) method29, vs qubit detuning away from their flux-insensitive point. The data, representing the median over all qubits in the processor, compare the performance measured with the SNIMPAs (orange) to that measured in a separate cooldown of the same processor with the standard IMPA amplifiers (blue). The data indicate that the SNIMPA have no adverse effect on qubit dephasing as compared to our standard dc-SQUID based amplifiers.\nFinally, we performed multi-tone experiments to test the SNIMPA performance in an emulated simultaneous multiqubit readout scenario. We chose to do so, instead of directly characterizing multi-qubit readout fidelity, to avoid confounding qubit-related physics at high readout powers2 that can mask the underlying performance of the amplifiers. As a baseline, we first measure the amplifier signal power gain and SNR improvement (SNR gain) as a function of frequency with a single (\u2018isolated\u2019), weak readout tone (approximately \u2212130 dBm), as shown in Fig. 4(a). We then repeat the measurement with five additional tones (emulating the sixqubit multiplexed readout in the Sycamore processor7), and with each tone having 10 dB higher power, as illustrated in Fig. 4(b). Here, each one of the readout tones is swept in turn across its corresponding frequency band (respective color) and we measure the signal and SNR gains while the others tones are on and are kept at the fixed frequencies indicated by the respective vertical dashed lines. Figure 4(c) and (d) show the gain and SNR improvement, respectively, for our standard dc-SQUID based IMPA, clearly showing a degradation in both quantities in the multi-tone experiment (color) compared with the low-power baseline (black). In contrast, no such degradation is observed with the SNIMPA, as shown in Fig. 4(e)-(f). In fact, we found it difficult to drive the SNIMPA to saturation with our standard readout electronics setup. These experiments demonstrate that the SNIMPA\u2019s high saturation power offers sufficient headroom in a multiqubit readout situation to enable more efficient readout multiplexing with higher number of qubits read-out simultaneously per channel. The SNIMPA can also accommodate higher power per readout tone, which may be required for highfidelity, fast readout with greater qubit-resonator detuning or weaker qubit-resonator coupling.\nIn summary, we have demonstrated impedance matched Josephson parametric amplifiers with saturation powers up to\ntwo orders of magnitude higher than their standard dc-SQUID based counterparts. By combining an rf-SQUID array nonlinear element with an impedance matching taper, these amplifiers achieve sufficient instantaneous bandwidth to support 6:1 frequency-multiplexed readout of our Sycamore processors. We have measured a median readout efficiency of 20%, extracted an upper bound for the SNIMPA noise temperature at around 60% over the quantum limit, and found no excess amplifier-related dephasing compared to our standard IMPAbased setup."

            "text": "Here, we outline the derivation of the snake SQUID array potential, current-phase relation, and inductance. A schematic of the snake array is shown in Fig. S1. We will assume that the array is sufficiently long, so that we can neglect edge effects, and treat the array as translationally invariant1.\nWe will refer to the inductive loops containing a junction and inductors L1 and L2, essentially an rf-SQUID, as the \u201csmall loop\" (see Fig. S1). In the small loop, the phase drop across L1 is \u03b1 and the phase drop across L2 is \u03b2 . The junction phase is \u03b4 as usual. The sign convention for the phases is such that \u03b2 and \u03b4 grow from left to right, whereas the direction of \u03b1 alternates downwards and upwards as the inductive spine of the snake meanders. We will refer to the loop that encloses the full snake array and any inductance Lb external to it (for example, the self-inductance of a bias transformer) as the \u201cbig loop\", as shown in Fig. S2. The snake we will consider has 2N unit cells, so when implementing a \u201cdc-SQUID-like\" structure (Fig. S2) we will have two N-unit-cell arrays in parallel.\nFrom flux quantization of any of the small loops of the snake we have the relation between the phases:\n2\u03b1 +\u03b2 = \u03b4 , (S1)\nand with a total phase drop of \u03c6 across the full array with 2N sections array we have:\n2N (\u03b4 \u2212\u03b1) = \u03c6 .

Schematic of the snake array, with the phases \u03b1 , \u03b2 , and \u03b4 indicated. The unit cell is highlighted with a dashed box.\nWe can write the total potential energy of the array and use Eqs.

(S6) and Eq. (S7), and some algebra we finally get an implicit equation for \u03b40(\u03c6e):\n\u03b40 ( L1 +L2\u2212Lb\n(2L1 +L2) 2\nLb (4L1 +L2)+2NL1L2\n) +\nL1L2 LJ sin\u03b40 = \u03c6e L1L2 (2L1 +L2) Lb (4L1 +L2)+2NL1L2 (S8)\nNote that when Lb = 0, this equation reduces to Eq. (S6) as it should, where \u03c6e = \u03c6 . Eq. (S8) can be solved numerically to find the equilibrium phase \u03b40 as a function of applied flux \u03c6e.\nAnother way to get the same result is to consider the current-phase relation I(\u03c6) of the snake itself, which can be found from the derivative of the potential with respect to the phase drop \u03c6 :\nI = (\n2\u03c0 \u03a60 ) dU d\u03c6 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03b40\n(S9)\n= ( \u03a60 2\u03c0 ) \u00d7 [ \u2212\u03b40 ( 1 L1 + 2 L2 ) + \u03c6 2N ( 1 L1 + 4 L2 )] (S10)\nThe external flux that needs to be applied to the \u201cbig loop\" to affect a phase drop \u03c6 across the array is \u03a602\u03c0 \u03c6e, where\n\u03c6e = \u03c6 + 2\u03c0 \u03a60 LbI(\u03c6), (S11)\nand using Eq. (S9):\n\u03c6e = \u03c6 \u2212Lb [ \u03b40 (\n1 L1 + 2 L2\n) \u2212 \u03c6\n2N ( 1 L1 + 4 L2 )] , (S12)\nWhich is equivalent to Eq. (S7). The inductance of the snake SQUID, with the array tapped in the middle to form two N-section segments in parallel, and closed in the \u201cbig loop\" through Lb can be found by taking the\nsecond derivative of the potential of Eq. (S3) with respect to the phase \u03c6 , and since \u03b40 depends on \u03c6 as well, we have to be careful to capture the full derivative:\nLs = N 2 ( \u03a60 2\u03c0 )2 \u00d7 ( \u2202 2U \u2202\u03c6 2 + \u2202 2U \u2202\u03c6\u2202\u03b40 \u2202\u03b40 \u2202\u03c6 )\u22121 . (S13)\nCarrying out the derivatives we get:\nLs = N 2 (L1 +L2)LJ +L1L2 cos\u03b40 LJ +(4L1 +L2)cos\u03b40 . (S14)\nThis is the contribution of the snake itself, with \u03b40 given by Eq. (S8), and we can add Lb/2 to each of the SQUID parallel branches.\nFigure S3 shows the calculated inductance vs flux curves for a device with N = 20 junctions per arm, small-loop inductances L1 = 2.6 pH and L2 = 8.0 pH, Lb = 124 pH, and for several values of Ic. We see that the inductance here is always positive (unlike that of the simple rf-SQUID), and that the depth of inductance modulation depends on the junction critical current, with lower Ic resulting in shallower modulation.\nNote that the applied flux in Fig. S3 is per junction, or in other words, a snake with N junctions will require N times more flux bias than a single rf-SQUID to reach the operating point. This is why our amplifier requires a large bias transformer, and in general higher pump currents than the traditional dc-SQUID based JPA.\n3 FIG. S3. Inductance of the Snake SQUID, on a logarithmic scale, as a function of applied flux (per junction) for several junction Ic\nFigure S4 shows the reflected phase vs bias from a SNIMPA amplifier similar to those discussed in the main text but with a smaller shunt capacitor, measured with the pump off. The dotted red curve in the figure indicates the calculated resonance frequency of the capacitively shunted snake inductor, using Ic = 14 \u00b5A, Cs = 5.5 pF, and with a stray inductance of 30 pH (Lb = 120 pH). The figure indicates that the inductance of the snake SQUID modulates as expected with flux bias, with negligible flux offset and a symmetric response about zero flux.\nWe found that magnetic shielding of the amplifiers is important to their operation. Unshielded devices show low gains, typically only 5-10 dB, with significant flux offset and notable asymmetry in their modulation curves. Note that the biasing scheme shown in Fig. S2 results in neighboring rf-SQUIDs being biased in antiferromagentic fashion. Flux trapped in the array or its immediate vicinity, as well as any global magnetic field background, will therefor cause a non-uniform biasing of the device."

In practice, this translates to the rate at which the readout signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) improves as a function of measurement time, t.

The measurement system is configured according to Ref. 6, and expanded to allow 2-port SOLT calibration7.\nWe first characterize all components in our readout assembly separately, including cables, circulators, and circuit board traces. We can add up the insertion loss measured for these components to estimate a lower limit on the total loss in our system between the processor and the SNIMPA, \u22122.5 dB for the experiments described here.\nWhen components are cascaded and built into a complete readout assembly, reflections from circulators and connectors can contribute to the overall insertion loss. In addition, electrical delays associated with the electrical lengths of connectors and circuit board traces can add significant frequency dependence to the overall loss.

The inset shows a zoom-in on the frequency range corresponding to our readout band (highlighted with dashed lines in the inset), and we can see that indeed the insertion loss varies with frequency.\nThe details of the insertion loss will vary from one readout line to the next, therefore in the main text we only use the measured minimum loss number, and obtain an upper bound on the SNIMPA added noise.
