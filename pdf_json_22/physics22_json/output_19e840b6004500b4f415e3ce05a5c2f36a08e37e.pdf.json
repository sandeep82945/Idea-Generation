    "abstractText": "We study the band structure and transport properties of ferromagnetic tetragonal silicene nanoribbons by using the non-equilibrium Green\u2019s function method. The band structure and spin-dependent conductance are discussed under the combined effect of the external electric field, potential energy, exchange field and the spinorbit coupling. One can easily realize a phase transition from a semimetallic to a semiconducting state by changing the transverse width of the nanoribbon. Separation of spin-dependent conductances arises from the effect of exchange field and the spin-orbit coupling, while zero-conductance behaviors exhibit spin-dependent band gaps induced by the electric field. We propose a device configuration of four-terminal tetragonal silicene nanoribbon with two central channels. It is found that spin current can be controlled by utilizing two switches. The switch with a high potential barrier can block electrons flowing from the central scattering region into other terminals. Interestingly, applying only one switch can realize spin-dependent zero conductance and large spin polarization. Two switches can provide multiple operations for controlling spin-dependent transport properties. The two-channel ferromagnetic tetragonal silicene nanoribbon can realize an effective separation of spin current, which may be a potential candidate for spintronic devices.",

The band structure and spin-dependent conductance are discussed under the combined effect of the external electric field, potential energy, exchange field and the spinorbit coupling. One can easily realize a phase transition from a semimetallic to a semiconducting state by changing the transverse width of the nanoribbon. Separation of spin-dependent conductances arises from the effect of exchange field and the spin-orbit coupling, while zero-conductance behaviors exhibit spin-dependent band gaps induced by the electric field. We propose a device configuration of four-terminal tetragonal silicene nanoribbon with two central channels. It is found that spin current can be controlled by utilizing two switches. The switch with a high potential barrier can block electrons flowing from the central scattering region into other terminals. Interestingly, applying only one switch can realize spin-dependent zero conductance and large spin polarization. Two switches can provide multiple operations for controlling spin-dependent transport properties. The two-channel ferromagnetic tetragonal silicene nanoribbon can realize an effective separation of spin current, which may be a potential candidate for spintronic devices.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nSpintronics involves the study of an effective manipulation of spin polarization in solid-state systems [1\u20133]. Twodimensional hexagonal lattices with unique electronic and superior optoelectronic has triggered worldwide interest in the fields of condensed matter physics and device physics. The buckled two-dimensional crystal, such as silicene, germanene and stanene would enable new classes of nanoelectronic and spintronic devices [4]. Vertical stacking 2D materials can provide device applications in vertical transistors, infrared photodetectors, and spintronic transistors [5]. As a low-buckling hexagonal lattice composed of single-layer silicon atoms, silicene has many different properties compared with graphene. Due to sp3 hybridization, silicene is very unstable when exposed to air, so a substrate is needed for its epitaxial growth. In recent years, it has been synthesized on the metal surface, such as Ag (111) and Ir (111) [6, 7]. Then silicene has aroused people great interest in theoretical and experimental researches [8\u201310]. Silicene has a relatively large spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which can open a relatively large band gap near the Dirac point [11]. Therefore, it has great potential applications in spintronics and valleytronics [12, 13].\nIn the early days, it was considered that the hexagonal lattice is a necessary condition for the emergence of Dirac points. Recently, the viewpoint that non-hexagonal honeycomb structures have stable Dirac cones has been proposed [14\u201317]. Researchers have many predictions of graphene, silicon carbide and silicene allotrope structures, and the tetragonal structure proves this viewpoint. Similar to tetragonal graphene [18], tetragonal silicene has strong stability near the Fermi level, and can maintain its structural stability at high temperature until 1000K. Relevant studies\n\u2217 bairu@hdu.edu.cn \u2020 liyuan@hdu.edu.cn\nhave shown that this kind of silicene forms a buckling structure in space, which is a nodal line semimetal near the Fermi surface and has a linear dispersion relation. In addition, hydrogenation can induce a transition from the semimetal state to the semiconductor state for the tetragonal silicene. Some studies have shown that the band structure of tetragonal silicene can be modulated by adjusting the tight-binding parameters and on-site energies [19]. Furthermore, it is proposed to modulate energy bands by utilizing the biaxial strain [20]. Some researchers have studied the optical and thermoelectric properties of tetragonal silicene by using the first-principle method [21], the results of which show highly anisotropy of its optical response. Hence, nanoribbons with different edge morphology can improve the optical and thermoelectric properties. What\u2019s more, tetragonal silicene was demonstrated to be a candidate for enhancing nonlinear optical and photocatalytic activities [22].\nHowever, transport properties of tetragonal silicene have not been widely discussed. In this paper, the transport properties of tetragonal silicene heterojunction are calculated by using non-equilibrium Green\u2019s function method (NEGF). The spin orientation is separated by utilizing the combined effect of the electric field, exchange field and spin-orbit coupling, so as to achieve a perfect spin polarization. Our results show that the exchange field can break spin degeneracy and modulate energy bands in the presence of an electric field. Hence, the simultaneous action of the electric field, exchange field and spin-orbit coupling can help to achieve a large spin polarization. Furthermore, we design a four-terminal nanodevice with two-channel configurations. By applying opposite amplitudes of electric fields and exchange fields, spin-polarized currents can flow out of the two channels. Combining with the action of switches, we can easily obtain a desired spin-polarized current at the middle terminal.\nIn the study of the quantum transport, Dirac theory is a very effective method. It can help us to get analytical results and provide basic physical meaning of some problems. And for complex geometric structures, using a more general\n2 Lx\nSource DrainScattering Region\nLy\n1 2\n3\n4\nN-3 N-2\nN-1\nN\n\u2026\ny\nx\nz a2\nt2\ntso1 tso2 tso1\n(a)\n(b) (c) (d) (e) A\nB\nFIG. 1: (a) The schematic of tetragonal silicene heterojunction.

In addition, by utilizing NEGF method, the effects of lead and other interactions can be systematically incorporated into the tight-binding model [23]. It can deal with a wide range of conductors composed of scattering regions and external leads under the bias voltage. Therefore, compared with the effective Dirac Hamiltonian, the tight-binding NEGF technique has a wider range of applications. It is of great significance to develop and demonstrate its application in the tetragonal silicene systems.\nThe paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II, we give the theoretical calculating method of a tetragonal silicene nanoribbon under the influence of the spin-orbit coupling, the electric field and exchange field applied on the central scattering region. In Sec. III, we analyze the dispersion relations and employ NEGF to study the spin-dependent conductance. The effects of the external electric field, on-site energy, exchange field and the spin-orbit coupling on the spin-polarized current are analyzed and discussed. In addition, motivated by the perfect spin polarization, we design a nanodevice to obtain spin-polarized currents. Finally, a summary is given in Sec. IV."

The size of the central region is chosen to be Lx = 127 nm and Ly = 10.6 nm, corresponding to Nx = 280 and Ny = 48, respectively.\nAs shown in Fig. 2, the dispersion relation of ATSNR depends on the transverse width Ny of the nanoribbon. Interestingly, there exist repeated phase transitions between semimetal states and semiconductor states when the site number changes from Ny = 4 to 18. In Figs. 2(a)-2(c), we can see that the conduction bands near zero energy overlap with the valence bands and form a semimetal state when Ny is a multiple of four, namely Ny = 4n with the integer n = 1, 2, 3, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . The linear dispersion relation near zero energy in Fig. 2(a) is consistent with that reported in Ref. [19].\nSeen from Fig. 1(a), when Ny = 4n, there exist complete silicon rings, or a symmetrical axis along x direction, thus the silicon atoms are symmetrical about the transverse symmetrical axis. It means that the nanoribbon with a transverse symmetry becomes a semimetalic system. In Fig. 2(d)-2(f), Ny = 6, 10, 18 which is not the multiple of four, there exists no transverse symmetrical axis.

When the onsite energy V0 = 0.15 eV is applied on the central region, the whole band structure moves up 0.15 eV. The applied electric field can open a band gap about 0.1 eV, as shown in Fig. 3(c) and Fig. 3(d). We can find that the band gap and the positions of subbands can be modulated by the electric field and the onsite energy, while the overlapped structures of subbands keep unchanged.\nTherefore, one can open a band gap of the tetragonal silicene with the help of an external electric field to further inhibit the transmission of electrons and act as a nanoswitch.

It is crucial for spin-based devices to realize an effective modulation of spin polarization. The exchange field can be useful for improving the spin polarization of the system. Thus we further study the combined effect of the exchange field and the electric field on the energy bands in ATSNR.\nFirst, we fix the sublattice potenial to E\u03be = 0.15 eV. In Fig. 5 we plot the dispersion relation as a function of the wave vector kx. When M = 0, we can see that the energy bands are spin degeneracy, and there exists a band gap with the amplitude of 0.3eV . With the exchange field increasing to M = 0.05 eV, the spin-up energy bands move up 0.05 eV, while spin-down energy bands move downwards. The band gap correspondingly decreases to about 0.2 eV due to the opposite shift of spin-dependent energy bands. When M = 0.15 eV, the spin-down conduction band touches with the spin-up valence band, thus resulting in disappearance of the band gap. With the amplitude of the exchange field increasing to 0.2 eV, spin-dependent energy bands overlap with each other, and the maximum value of the spin-up valence band is larger than the minimum value of the spin-down conduction band [see Fig. 5(d)].\nNext we discuss the effect of the sublattice potential on the energy bands for the fixed exchange field M = 0.15 eV.

Since the tetragonal silicene also has a low-buckled structure, it is possible for the next-nearest-neighbor hopping term to induce a spin-orbit coupling. So far, there has few research work in literature reporting the effect of the spin-orbit coupling in the tetragonal silicene. In this paper, we first propose to include the contribution of the spin-orbit coupling by adopting phenomenological next-nearest-neighbor hopping parameters, which need to be verified by future experimental measures or calculating results obtained from DFT method.\n5\nThus an extra Hamiltonian arising from the next-nearestneighbor hopping terms can be written as [24]\nHS OC = itso\n\u2211\n\u3008\u3008i, j\u3009\u3009,\u03b1\u03b2 \u03bdi jc\n\u2020 i\u03b1\u03c3 z \u03b1\u03b2 c j\u03b2\n+itR\n\u2211\n\u3008\u3008i, j\u3009\u3009,\u03b1\u03b2 \u00b5ic \u2020 i\u03b1(~\u03c3 \u00d7 di j) z \u03b1\u03b2c j\u03b2,\n(5)\nhere the first term represents the intrinsic SOC, and the second term refers to Rashba SOC. The amplitude tR of Rashba SOC is relatively smaller. It is find that Rashba term does not cause an effective spin splitting, which is neglected in the following calculations. As shown in Fig. 1(c), the tetragonal silicene has only two kinds of next-nearest-neighbor hopping modes, namely tso1 and tso2 corresponding to the hopping distances L4 and L3, respectively. Since the two distances satisfy the relation L4 \u2248 1.29L3, we assume that two SOC hopping terms have a fixed proportional relationship, namely tso2 = \u03b7ttso1 = tso with \u03b7 = 1.3.\nSpin-dependent energy bands of ATSNR for different strengths of SOC are plotted as a function of the wave vector kx, as shown in Fig. 7. It can be seen that SOC can result in tilted subbands. What\u2019s more, spin-up energy bands move towards upper right portion, while spin-down energy bands move towards upper left portion. With increasing of the strength of SOC, the tilted angle gradually increases. For example, when tso = 0.1eV, there exist obvious overlapping\nsubbands in the range of kx > 0. While a large band gap is induced by SOC in the range of kx < 0.\nNext we study the combined effect of the exchange field, SOC and the sublattice potential on the energy bands. When E\u03be = 0.15eV and M = 0.05eV, there exists a band gap and spin splitting in the absence of SOC, which associates with the energy bands given in Fig. 5(b). In Fig. 8, considering the effect of SOC with tso = 0.1eV, spin-up and spindown subbands tilted towards opposite directions. With the exchange field increasing to 0.07eV, the spin-down subbands move downwards, while the spin-up subbands move upwards. Thus the spin-down conduction band and the spin-up valence band begin to touch each other near kx \u2248 0.6\u03c0/a. Interestingly, the tilted angles of the spin-dependent subbands keep unchanged when SOC is fixed to be 0.1eV. When M increases to 0.1eV, the spin-dependent subbands overlap and the bang gap disappears. When the exchange field is changed to the opposite direction, the overlapping subbands locate at the left region with negative values for the wave vector kx, as shown in Fig. 8(d)"

The total conductance has no zero value due to the overlapping of spin-down conduction bands and spin-up valence bands.

With help of the latest quantum dot technology, we can chisel the central scattering region into two channels, and select two narrow regions [see green parts] in the right buffer layer to exert high potential barriers in order to control the flowing of electrons, which work as switches. The central two channels work under the combined effect of the exchange field and the sublattice potential. The drain lead is divided into three terminals connecting with the right buffer layer.\nWe first study the effect of switches on the spin-\n7 Source Channel 1 Channel 2\nScattering Region Drain\nSwitch 1\nSwitch 2\nFIG. 10: Schematic of four-terminal two channels spin-based ATSNR. Red and blue arrows indicate spin currents of spin-up and spin-down electrons, respectively. Channel 1 and 2 can achieve a fully spin-polarized current. The green region acts as a switch and inhibits the flow of electrons by applying a high potential barrier Vs.\ndependent current for the two-channel ATSNR. It is expected to control the flowing of spin current by utilizing two switches [see green regions]. Gate voltages of the two switches are set to be V1s = V2s = 4 eV. The two channels have opposite amplitudes of exchange fields and sublattice potentials, namely M1 = E\u03be1 = 0.15eV and M2 = E\u03be2 = \u22120.15eV. The spindependent conductances of three terminals of the two-channel ATSNR are plotted as a function of Fermi energy, as shown in Fig. 11. Due to high potential barriers of the two switches, namely V1s = V2s = 4 eV, the conductance of terminal 3 [see Fig. 11(b)] is much smaller than those of terminal 2 and 4. The maximum conductance of terminal 3 is about 0.03G0, while the maximum conductance of terminal 2 and 4 is about 4.41G0, which is 147 times the conductance of terminal 3. This means that the two switches basically block the electrons flowing from the central scattering region into terminal 3. Accordingly, the spin current of terminal 2 (terminal 4) is basically modulated by the parameters of channel 1 (channel 2).\nFor terminal 2, we can find that the spin-up conductance G\u2191 is zero in the energy range 0 \u2264 E \u2264 0.3 eV, and G\u2191 gradually increases with oscillating behaviors when E > 0.3 eV. While the spin-down conductance G\u2193 has a zero value in the energy range \u22120.3 eV \u2264 E \u2264 0. The spin-dependent zero conductances associate with energy bands given in Fig. 5(c). When M1 = E\u03be1 = 0.15eV, there exists a band gap with 0.3eV for spin-up electrons in the energy range 0 \u2264 E \u2264 0.3 eV, the spin-down band gap occurs at the energy range \u22120.3 eV \u2264 E \u2264 0. When 0 < E < 0.2 eV, spin-dependent subbands evolve from the flat band to fully occupied bands for all of wave vectors, which result in a spin-down conductance plateaus in this energy range. Similarly, there also exists a conductance plateaus for spin-up electrons in the energy range \u22120.2 eV \u2264 E \u2264 0.

According to previous analyses, we know that a band gap can be opened when the amplitude of the sublattice potential is larger than that of the exchange field, namely E\u03be > M. It means that one can modulate the total conductance to zero value by increasing the sublattice potential in the two-channel ATSNR. Since channel 2 has opposite amplitudes of the exchange field and the sublattice potential, namely M2 = E\u03be2 = \u22120.15eV, the spin-dependent conductances have opposite transport behaviors, as shown in Fig. 11(c). Interestingly, we can realize an effective spin polarization by using the two-channel ATSNR. The fully spin currents can be generated and separated into two different terminals in the energy range \u22120.3 eV \u2264 E \u2264 0.3 eV.\nNext the gate voltage V1s of switch 1 is changed to zero, and V2s keeps 4 eV so as to control the spin current flowing from channel 2.

Other parameters are the same as those in Fig. 11.\nductances of terminal 4 basically keep unchanged due to high potential barrier of switch 2. However, when V1s = 0, the maximum value of conductances of terminal 2 significantly decreases to about 1.32G0 and the conductance plateaus also disappears [see Fig. 12(a)]. It is obvious that the conductances of terminal 3 significantly increase and zero-conductance ranges are identical with those of terminal 2. But the conductance amplitude of terminal 3 is larger than that of terminal 2. It means that electrons prefer entering into terminal 3 through switch 1. When V1s = 4eV and V2s = 0, namely switch 2 is open and switch 1 is closed, similarly, electrons will flow from channel 2 into terminal 3 through switch 2. Correspondingly, the transport behaviors of terminals 2 and 4 are exchanged comparing with previous switch configuration.\nWhen the two switches are open, namely V1s = V2s = 0, the zero-conductance ranges for terminals 2 and 4 disappear, as shown in Fig. 13.

It means that there exists no spin polarization in terminal 3. In terms of above analyses, spin-dependent conductance can be effectively modulated by utilizing one switch or two switches. Especially, applying only one switch can realize a spin-dependent zero conductance and large spin polarization. The amplitudes of the exchange field and the sublattice potential are crucial for creation of spin currents. Then two switches can provide multiple operations for controlling of spin-dependent transport properties.\n9 -0.5 -0.4 -0.3 -0.2 -0.1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5\nE (eV)\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\n7\nG (\nG 0 )\nG\nG G\n(a)\n-0.5 -0.4 -0.3 -0.2 -0.1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5\nE (eV)\n0\n0.5\n1\n1.5\n2\n2.5\n3\n3.5\n4\nG (\nG 0 )\n10-3\nG\nG G\n(b)\n-0.5 -0.4 -0.3 -0.2 -0.1 0 0.1 0.2 0.3 0.4 0.5\nE (eV)\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\nG (\nG 0 )\nG\nG G\n(c)\nFIG. 14: Spin-dependent conductances of two-channel ATSNR for (a) terminal 2, (b) terminal 3 and (c) terminal 4 are plotted as a function of Fermi energy.

While SOC induces tilted subbands and results in disappearance of the band gap [see Fig. 8]. Thus the total conductance has no zero value in Fig. 14. It is found that the spin-up conductance of terminal 2 has a zero value in the energy range 0 < E < 0.18eV, while the spin-down conductance has a zero value in the energy range \u22120.18eV < E < 0, which associate with the tilted subbands. Obviously, the spin-dependent conductances are not symmetrical about the axis E = 0 because of the tilted subbands, which are different from the cases without SOC. Similarly, the spin-dependent conductances of terminal 4 have opposite transport behaviors due to the opposite amplitudes of E\u03be2 and M2. Certainly, the conductances of terminal 3 are controlled to be small values by the action of the high potential barriers of V1s and V2s.\nWhen switch 1 is opened, namely V1s = 0, the conductances of terminal 3 significantly increase, while the conduc-\n10\ntances of terminal 2 accordingly decrease. The maximum value of the total conductance in terminal 3 is about 4.7G0. What\u2019s more, the spin polarization of terminal 3 is similar with that of terminal 2. It means that the spin-polarized electrons flow from channel 1 into terminal 3 via switch 1. The conductances of terminal 4 keep the same variation trends as those given in Fig. 14(c) due to the high potential of switch 2. It is obvious that one can still obtain the spin-polarized conductance in the presence of SOC, even though the zeroconductance ranges are different. When the two switches are open, namely V1s = V2s = 0, the zero-conductance ranges of terminals 2 and 4 disappear. The spin-dependent conductances of G\u2191 and G\u2193 are basically identical in all of the three terminals. It means that the spin polarization closes to zero. In terms of above analyses, SOC can induce tilted energy bands and modulate the size of the band gap. Accordingly, the zeroconductance range and the spin polarization can be affected by SOC. As we expected, the two-channel ATSNR can realize an effective separation of spin current. This phenomenon suggests that tetragonal silicene may be a potential candidate for spintronic devices."

            "text": "In summary, we have studied the band structure and transport properties of ferromagnetic tetragonal silicene nanoribbon by using non-equilibrium Green\u2019s function method. The band structure and spin-dependent conductance are discussed under the combined effect of the external electric field (sublattice potential), potential energy, the exchange field and SOC. The dispersion relation of ATSNR depends on the transverse width of the nanoribbon. One can easily real-\nize a phase transition from a semimetalic to semiconducting state by changing the transverse width of the nanoribbon. A band gap of tetragonal silicene can be opened due to the effect of the electric field. The combined effect of the exchange field and electric field can result in spin-dependent band gaps. SOC can induce tilted subbands and modulate the band gap. The tilted angle gradually increases with increasing of the strength of SOC. Separation of spin-dependent conductances arises from the effect of exchange field and SOC, while zeroconductance behaviors exhibit spin-dependent band gaps induced by the electric field. In terms of the band structure and spin-dependent conductance, we propose a device configuration of four-terminal two channels spin-based ATSNR. The central two channels work under the combined effect of the exchange field, sublattice potential and SOC. The drain lead is divided into three terminals connecting with right buffer layer. We find that the spin current can be controlled by utilizing two switches. The switch with high potential barrier can block electrons flowing from central scattering region into other terminals. Interestingly, applying only one switch can realize spin-dependent zero conductance and large spin polarization. The amplitudes of the exchange field, sublattice potential and SOC are crucial for generation of spin currents. Two switches can provide multiple operations for controlling spindependent transport properties. The two-channel ATSNR can realize an effective separation of spin current, which may be a potential candidate for spintronic devices."
