    "abstractText": "Due to the characteristics of multibody (MB) and finite element (FE) digital human body models (HBMs), the reconstruction of running pedestrians (RPs) remains a major challenge in traffic accidents (TAs) and new innovative methods are needed. This study presents a novel approach for reconstructing moving pedestrian TAs based on a humanoid robot method to improve the accuracy of analyzing dynamic vehicle\u2013pedestrian collision accidents. Firstly, we applied the theory of humanoid robots to the corresponding joints and centroids of the TNO HBM and implemented the pedestrian running process. Secondly, we used rigid\u2013flexible coupling HBMs to build pedestrians, which can not only simulate running but also analyze human injuries. Then, we validated the feasibility of the RP reconstruction method by comparing the simulated dynamics with the pedestrian in the accident. Next, we extracted the velocity and posture of the pedestrian at the moment of collision and further validated the modeling method through a comparison of human injuries and forensic autopsy results. Finally, by comparing two other cases, we can conclude that there are relative errors in both the pedestrian injury results and the rest position. This comparative analysis is helpful for understanding the differences in injury characteristics between the running pedestrian and the other two cases in TAs.",

Introduction\nCar\u2013pedestrian TAs are common collisions, with pedestrian deaths accounting for more than 25% of the annual TA deaths in China [1,2]. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) reported that in 2021, pedestrian deaths increased by 12.5% from 2020. Pedestrian fatalities as a percentage of all traffic fatalities increased steadily from 2005 to 2018, from 11.2% to 17.3% [3]. In addition, human injuries caused by TAs are diverse due to the complexity of causes. As well as head and neck injuries, limb and chest injuries are extremely common, especially lower limb fractures and visceral injuries [4]. Digital HBMs are an essential part in TA reconstruction research, and are the most applicable factors in the human\u2013vehicle\u2013road coupled model [5]. MB HBMs are highly efficient and can reconstruct the human movement process, but they cannot simulate biomechanical injuries such as fractures and abrasions. FE HBMs are highly precise and can simulate human biomechanical injuries; they cannot reconstruct the running state of a pedestrian [6,7]. The existing FE (MB) HBMs cannot meet the needs of simultaneously reconstructing the RP collision process and simulating the associated biomechanical injuries [8]. Therefore, to solve this problem, researchers have proposed a hybrid HBM\nSensors 2023, 23, 7882. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23187882 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2023, 23, 7882 2 of 19\nwith different functions and characteristics, which has been gradually applied to accident cases [4]. Humanoid robot research has been a hot topic in various fields since its inception. The humanoid running robot achieves the effect of stable walking by applying the theory to the joints and center of mass of the robot [9]. At present, many researchers have achieved good simulations of real walking situations, with high bionicity [10,11]. In addition, humanoid robots have been widely used in various fields [12]. The initial movement state of a pedestrian mainly refers to the posture and velocity immediately before the collision, which are crucial factors affecting the impact kinematics and sustained injuries of the pedestrian when reconstructing a car\u2013pedestrian TA [13\u201316]. In addition, several studies have reported that (i) pedestrians are usually moving at impact (either walking or running) [17,18] and (ii) post-impact pedestrian kinematics and injuries are significantly affected by the initial posture and walking velocity [19\u201324]. Furthermore, the US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Japan Automobile Research Institute (JERI) clearly define the pedestrian dummy postures to be used when simulating pedestrian\u2013vehicle collisions. However, due to the difficulty in obtaining the angles and velocities of body parts and joints at the vehicle\u2013pedestrian collision moment, the initial motion state of pedestrians has rarely been considered in vehicle\u2013pedestrian accident reconstructions, which is ultimately not conducive to traffic police accident identification and forensic injury identification. It further indicates the potential necessity of reconstructing moving pedestrian TAs. The overall aim of this study is to propose a humanoid-robot-based reconstruction method for vehicle\u2013running pedestrian accidents. First, we applied the principle of a running humanoid robot to the digital HBM to simulate the running and walking processes of pedestrians. Next, we simulated the dynamic process of the RP to reconstruct the car\u2013 pedestrian collision accident and to approximate the initial simulation state of the HBM. Then, we compared an accident case with the simulation results to validate the feasibility of this method. Finally, we analyzed the injury and dynamic errors between two other different conditions (ignoring the initial state of the pedestrian); this further illustrated the extent to which the simulation accuracy can be improved by considering the initial motion state of pedestrians.\n2. Materials and Methods\nWe used the Facet vehicle model and the rigid\u2013flexible coupled HBM to reconstruct a car\u2013running pedestrian TA based on the humanoid robot method. The dynamic simulation of the running process is based on (i) known accident information and (ii) equations for RP kinematics, thereby reconstructing the RP motion and posture. The customization process is shown in Figure 1.\n2.1. Facet Vehicle Model\nThe car model used herein is the Facet model (FM), which is an FE mesh of empty materials. The FM is a three-node or four-node unit and is attached completely to the reference space, rigid body, or deformed body, thereby ensuring accuracy and saving calculation time. The FM was built by importing and exporting the model to and from 3D Max, HYPERMESH, and MADYMO in turn and setting the relevant grids and nodes [25\u201327]. The vehicle FM and the curves of the contact characteristics are shown in Figures 2 and 3, respectively [28]. In MADYMO, the FM realizes the connections between different bodies and the relative motion between different parts; for example, car wheels can be split so that the simulation process is closer to the actual situation.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7882 3 of 19 Sensors 2023, 23, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 20\nSet the initial movement state of a pedestrian in MADYMO based on\nhumanoid robot method\nReconstruct pedestrian running process in MADYMO\nSet up velocity, etc.\nComparing the posture of pedestrians in accident with the\nsimulated HBM\nComparing human injuries in output accidents with forensic reports\nValidate running pedestrian method\nCustomization process of method\nValidate accident reconstruction models and methods\nCompare the case without considering the initial motion state\nof pedestrians, and analyze the error\nFigure 1.

Realization of Pedestrian Running State\nThe pedestrian posture can be realized by adjusting the joint positions of the HBM. For the FE HBM, which simulates a biomechanical injury of the human body, this can be achieved by applying an initial velocity to the whole translation or a slight mediation of the joints for approximation purposes in simulating pedestrian running or walking. However, this \u201cholistic\u201d method of determining the motion state cannot reflect the intrinsic relationship between the motion state and the walking velocity for each part of the human body. Additionally, the influence of the relative velocity of each part of the human body cannot be considered in the simulation results, especially for the local motion or injuries of the human body, which likely makes the simulation results inaccurate. In addition, human joint rotation angles judged and set based on experience and accident information are often not fully in line with human kinematics. The pedestrian running process adopts a humanoid robot method based on the concept of a \u201cvirtual leg\u201d [11,30]. One end of the leg is set as the center of the body, and the other is set as the origin of the reference coordinate system (Figure 6a). Then, taking the virtual leg length qr and the angle q\u03b8 between the virtual leg and the plumb line as the generalized coordinate system, the differential dynamic equations of the virtual leg motion, whose solution is the motion trajectory in the stage of centroid take off, can be expressed as{\nmq2r .. q\u03b8 + 2mqr . q\u03b8 . qr \u2212mgqr sin q\u03b8 = 0 m .. qr \u2212mqr . q2\u03b8 + mg cos q\u03b8 + kr(qr \u2212 qr0) = 0 , (3)\nwhere m is the mass of the human body, qr0 is the initial length of the spring, and qr is the stiffness coefficient. According to Equation (3), the trajectory, velocity, acceleration, etc., of the centroid at different times in the take-off stage can be calculated, and also the velocity of the RP can be controlled by the relevant parameters in Equation (3). The flight phase of the centroid is calculated according to the conservation of momentum for a body falling freely, and the centroid trajectory of the RP is a periodic trajectory comprising the take-off and flight stages (Figure 6c). The joint settings of the humanoid robot are highly similar to the TNO HBM. We applied the running process equation of the humanoid robot to the TNO HBM to realize the running process of pedestrians (Figure 6b). In designing the trajectories of the pedestrian\u2019s arm and lower body, the assumption is that they do not interfere with the body. The method of cubic spline curves and the centroid trajectory of the pedestrian are combined into a set of nonlinear equations [31\u201333], and the position, velocity, and acceleration of each joint at every moment are obtained by solving these equations, thereby realizing the running of the pedestrian, which ignores the degree of freedom of the elbow joint with the arm.

Second, the first-stage simulation results were input into the pedestrian\u2013vehicle collision simulation model as the initial conditions, and the accident was reconstructed.\n3.1. Accident Case Information\nThe TA occurred on a pedestrian zebra crossing (Figure 8a). A black car was travelling normally from north (the top of the figure) to south (the bottom of the figure); as it was about to drive over the zebra crossing, it collided with a pedestrian who was running quickly from west (left) to east (right). The pedestrian had not seen the approaching vehicle and was trying to cross the zebra crossing quickly in case of a red traffic light on the sidewalk. A row of cars that had stopped by the side of the road was blocking the line of sight for the driver of the approaching vehicle; thus, the driver did not see the pedestrian running from the side and did not apply the brakes in time; both were travelling relatively fast, so there was a collision. After the collision, the car continued to move forward and\nSensors 2023, 23, 7882 8 of 19\nturned left for a distance, and then stopped. The pedestrian was hit and flew up and landed on the road, stopped after sliding a certain distance on the ground, and died on the spot.

Determination of Initial Accident Parameters\nThe initial parameters of the car\u2013running pedestrian collision simulation in the running state include the collision velocity, pedestrian posture, collision angle, and so on at the moment of collision [15].\n3.2.1. Initial Velocity of Accident Vehicle\nBased o th China\u2019s national standards for zebra crossings, PhotoModeler was u ed to project pictures captured by the accident video to obtain the distance moved by the vehicle over a period of time. The initial velocity of the car was then calculated according to the time interval of the video [5]. Two pictures were captured from the video at frames 218 and 227 (Figure 8a,b). The PhotoModeler measurements showed that the distance travelled by the car between those two frames was 6.628 m, and the frame rate of the video was 25 fps; therefore, it can be concluded that the car was travelling at 18.41 m/s at the time of the collision. Similarly, the pedestrian was running at 4.168 m/s. However, the clarity of the video and other factors may have affected the results, so a deviation of \u00b110% is possible [26].\n3.2.2. Pedestrian Collision Posture\nWe extracted a frame from the video taken before the collision and used PhotoModeler software (https://www.photomodeler.com/) to measure the vehicle and pedestrian position information. According to he position informati n fr m the video, the velocities were a plied to the ca FM and the rigid\u2212flexible coupled HBM in MADYMO software, and the FE\u2212MB rigid\u2212flexible contact characteristics and he contact characteristic curves of the car were established [34]. As given in Table 2, the simulation results provide the angles and angular velocities, respectively, of the main joints at the moment of pedestrian collision, where R1, R2, and R3 are the rotation angles of the joints around the \u03be, \u03b7, and \u03b6 axes, respectively [35]. The running posture at the critical moment of the collision was compared with the video pictures in Figure 9a,b.

Accident Case Simulation\nThe TA model in this simulation is a pedestrian\u2013vehicle\u2013road coupled model including the road surface and zebra crossing. The simulation results from the first stage were input into the car\u2013running pedestrian collision simulation model (Figure 9c\u2013e). Then, the velocities are applied to the car and the pedestrian, consecutively, and the friction coefficients between the car and the ground, the pedestrian and the ground, and the car and the pedestrian were defined as 0.7, 0.6, and 0.3, respectively [4,5]. Finally, after several simulation iterations, the information about the pedestrian motion posture and rest position under different vehicle velocities, running velocities, and collision angles were obtained. Compared to the video of the collision, the following conclusions can be drawn: when the angle between the vehicle and the sidewalk is 2.7\u25e6, the car velocity is 18.5 m/s, and the pedestrian running velocity is 4.5 m/s. The pedestrian motion posture and rest position are basically consistent with the video, which proves that the physical process of the collision between the pedestrian and the car can be reconstructed accurately in this case. The simulation results show that the pedestrian\u2019s left leg collided with the car\u2019s right lamp in the middle of the zebra crossing, and then the pedestrian\u2019s upper back collided with the car\u2019s windshield. After that, the pedestrian was rotated forward in the air to a height of 4.2 m and then fell to the ground; finally, the pedestrian stopped after sliding for 5.38 m on the ground.\n3.4. Human Injury Analysis\nIn a car\u2013running pedestrian TA, the pedestrian\u2019s head and lower limbs are the most vulnerable, and craniocerebral injury is the most critical factor in disability and even death of the pedestrian [36]. The important criteria for judging the craniocerebral injury and lower extremity fractures are (i) the head injury criterion (HIC) [4] value and (ii) the von Mises stress of the lower extremities [37]. The simulated injury results were compared with the forensic autopsy results as shown in Table 3.\nHead Depressed fracture of skull, contusion of brain tissue HIC = 3913 1000 Left lower limb Fractures of tibia and femur of left lower limb Maximum shear force: 389.5 MPa 124 MPa\nThe acceleration curve (HIC = 3913) for the pedestrian\u2019s head far exceeds the HIC limit that the human body can bear (Figure 10a). This occurred in the first collision with the car windshield and the second collision with the ground, each of which was enough to cause severe craniocerebral injury. The simulation results are in line with the forensic autopsy results (Table 3). The maximum value of the von Mises stress distribution nephogram at the moment of collision with the pedestrian\u2019s left leg is 389.5 Mpa (Figure 10b), the maximum stress at the tibia and femur of the pedestrian\u2019s left lower limb exceeds the fracture tolerance limit of 124 MPa [37], and the maximum stress at the fibula is close to the tolerance limit. This is similar to the autopsy result, in which both the tibia and femur of the left lower limb were fractured (Table 3). The reliability of the accident simulation results is further shown.\n3.5.

Impact Analysis of Thrown Distance and Rest Position\nThe initial parameters of the accident simulation were obtained in the preceding part of the paper, and the accuracy and reliability of case 1 have been verified. We used the same method to simulate cases 2 and 3 (Figure 11a). In case 1, the joint angles and angular velocities of the RP were applied (Table 2), and the initial velocity was 4.5 m/s. In case 2, only the initial velocity is applied, and the posture is static (no joint angles). In case 3, the RP posture is static. The pedestrian rest position (Figure 11b), finial position (Figure 11c), and thrown distance were compared among the three simulations.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7882 11 of 19\nSensors 2023, 23, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 20 Figure 9.

Impact Analysis of Pedestrian Injury The primary concern regarding pedestrian injuries is about body parts in the collision\nwho injury causes death and serious injuries, including the head, chest, and lower limbs. Pedestrian head injuries is evaluated using the HIC value, which can be obtained from the head acceleration curve (Figure 12a). Thoracic injury is usually evaluated using the 3 ms acceleration curve criterion (Figure 12b). Lower-limb injury is evaluated using the equivalent stress nephogram of the lower-limb FE method (Figure 12c), and the maximum injury value and the moment of occurrence can be described using the lower limb torque curve, the shear force curve, and the axial force curve. Figure 12d and Table 4 show a comparative analysis of the relative error about the maximum injury values in the three cases.\nTable 4. Comparison the relative errors of three cases.\nFigure 11.

In this study, based on the humanoid robot method, we reconstructed the pedestrian running process and applied it to a traffic case. We validated the feasibility of this method by comparing injuries with the forensic autopsy results and by comparing pedestrian dynamics with CCTV footage. In addition, we compared a case without considering the initial state and analyzed the relative error. Comparing the rest positions (Figure 11b) of the three cases, we found that there is little difference in the rest position of the pedestrian in cases 1 and 2, but there is an obvious difference between case 3 and the other two cases. Therefore, we can deduce that the pedestrian\u2019s velocity is likely to affect how the body is thrown obliquely in the direction of running and affect the angle at which the body is thrown. This is in line with previous studies [13,38]. The pedestrian\u2019s final position in case 2 is 2.13 m, different to that of the other two schemes, and the angle difference is 9.5\u25e6 (Figure 11c). Hence, we predicted that the RP\u2019s collision posture and joint angular velocity are likely to affect the final position and landing posture of the human body. This is similar to the previous studies which found that gait is likely to affect the trajectory of pedestrians [23] or humanoid robots [9]. Comparing the head, chest, and lower limb injuries in the three cases (Figure 12 and Table 4), we found that case 1 is obviously higher than the other two cases for the maximum head and chest injuries, but the fluctuation trends in the injury values are approximately the same (Figure 12a,b). This is in line with a previous study [38] in which the pedestrian\u2019s initial posture and velocity affected the head acceleration value. In addition, the lower limb fracture injury value of case 2 is obviously higher than cases 1 and 3, but the stress distributions of the three cases are basically the same (Figure 12c). This is in good agreement with studies [16,24], showing that a pedestrian\u2019s posture and velocity can affect the stress and strain on knee ligaments. However, if we focus on the impact of the initial motion state on pedestrian injuries, more simulation and experimental research is needed. We simply made a comparison with the usual two cases. Although the RP\u2019s movement posture and injury after collision were reconstructed in the TA case, the current research still has some limitations. The first that should be considered is that the accident reconstruction must be completed in two processes due to the limitation of the software\u2019s algorithm function. This may complicate the accident reconstruction process and make it cumbersome. Another limitation is that we can accurately apply the velocity, but it is difficult to ensure the trajectories of the arms and limbs in the HBM are consistent with the RP. The movement trajectories of pedestrian limbs are often different at different velocities; thus, we did not take this aspect into account when validating the RP. The third is that the authors did not consider the limitation originating from biological variability. Although the rigid\u2013flexible coupled HBM has a high fidelity and is scaled according to the victim\u2019s height and weight, there may be biological differences between different individuals, and it is difficult to ensure that the biomechanics of the HBM are completely consistent with the victim. In addition, this paper does not consider pre-collision reactions such as compensation behavior and the reaction times of drivers and pedestrians. These factors will have a certain impact on the outcome of the accident. It is worthwhile examining all these issues through further studies.\nSensors 2023, 23, 7882 14 of 19\n5. Conclusions\nIn summary, this study proposed a novel approach for reconstructing moving pedestrian TAs based on a humanoid robot method. To improve the accuracy of car\u2013running pedestrian accident reconstruction, we applied the theory of humanoid robots to the corresponding joints and centroids of the TNO HBM and simulated the pedestrian running process. We validated this model by reconstructing an RP case. The comparison of the simulated dynamics and pedestrians and the comparison of simulated injury and forensic autopsy results both validated the feasibility of the reconstruction method of RPs. In contrast to two other cases, there are relative errors in the pedestrian injury and the rest position. This comparative analysis is helpful for understanding the differences in injury characteristics between the running pedestrian and the other two cases in TAs.\nAuthor Contributions: Data curation, B.W.; Formal analysis, S.G.; Resources, Q.W.; Software, Z.W.; Supervision, P.Y.; Validation, Q.W. and B.W.; Visualization, X.J.; Writing\u2014original draft, Q.W.; Writing\u2014review and editing, Q.W.

[42], Viano et al. [43], and Roberts et al. [44], the limbs and trunk of the hybrid HBM were subjected to blunt force verification, as shown in Figure A2. In MADYMO, an impact hammer was used to successively impact the shoulder, chest, and lower limbs of the hybrid HBM, and the dynamic response results of the human body were obtained and compared with experimental results. As given in Table A2, the errors between the simulation and experimental results are allowable, thereby showing that the dynamic characteristics of the digital HBM are consistent with the biomechanical characteristics of the human body.

[45]. The Crandall test and the MADYMO simulation test were compared in Figure A3, and the details of the corpse and vehicle are given in Table A3.\nFigure A3.

According to the cadaver impact test, the kinematic response states of the three are basically the same, as shown in Figure A4. At the same time, the maximum von Mises stress of the femur and tibia exceeded the tolerance limit of bone by 124 MPa, which was consistent with the result for human fracture in the Crandall test.\nSensors 2023, 23, x FOR PEER REVIEW 17 of 20\nFigure A3.
