The temperature for these xoplanets is high enough that refractory species remain gaseous nd therefore detectable in the photosphere. These conditions are herefore ideal for studying study a range of physical phenomena at uch extreme temperatures, such as the thermal dissociation, rain-out, nd ionization of atomic species. In recent years, a number of UHJs ave been characterized, with numerous species detected in their tmosphere in both primary and secondary eclipse using ground ased high-resolution spectroscopy (HRS) at optical wavelengths e.g. Hoeijmakers et al. 2019 ; Seidel et al. 2019 ; Bourrier et al.\nE-mail: gandhi@strw .leidenuniv .nl NHFP Sagan Fellow\ni 2 f s\n2022 The Author(s). ublished by Oxford University Press on behalf of Royal Astronomical Society.

These bservations are ideal to detect trace species in the atmosphere due o their high sensitivity and resolution of R 25 000, allowing for lear absorption and emission lines to be extracted from the spectra see e.g. re vie w by Birkby 2018 ).\nWASP-76 b has had one of the most well-characterized atmopheres UHJs to date with a mass of 0.894 M J , radius of 1.854 R J , and n equilibrium temperature of \u223c2160 K with full redistribution (West t al. 2016 ). Recently, Ehrenreich et al. ( 2020 ) sho wed v ariation n the strength and position of the Fe signal in WASP-76 b with rimary eclipse observations using the ESPRESSO spectrograph n the VLT, and proposed that this variation could be a result of ondensation of Fe on the night side of the atmosphere. These bservations have also been used to detect numerous atomic and onic species in the atmosphere (Tabernero et al. 2021 ; Kesseli et al. 022 ) and to resolve more of the asymmetric condensation features or some species (Kesseli et al. 2022 ).

Both of\nhese observations have also been combined to constrain day-night nd vertical winds in the atmosphere by studying the Na doublet Seidel et al. 2021 ).\nA range of three-dimensional (3D) general circulation models GCMs) have been used to interpret the asymmetric Fe signal in the tmosphere of WASP-76 b. Such complex models simulate a wide ange of physical and chemical processes and provide an unparalleled evels of spatial and dynamical detail for hot Jupiters (e.g. Showman t al. 2009 ; Dobbs-Dixon & Agol 2013 ; Rauscher & Menou 2013 ; ayne et al. 2014 ), as well as UHJs (e.g. Tan & Komacek 2019 ). mportantly, such 3D models can also be used to predict spatial ariability in the abundance of the chemical species and temperature tructure of the atmosphere and hence in each limb of the terminator, s well as velocity shifts of the spectra due to winds. These models ave shown that the Fe asymmetry in WASP-76 b could be a result f cloud formation on the cooler morning side (Savel et al. 2022 ), r the thermal asymmetry and wind profiles within the atmosphere Wardenier et al. 2021 ). Hence, it is currently unclear whether Fe is nherently weaker on the leading limb due to its lower abundance r whether clouds/temperature can affect the signal significantly to lter its strength.\nIn contrast to GCMs, retrie v al frame works of exoplanetary atospheres determine the best-fitting parameters for exoplanet atospheres from observations, often exploring many millions of odels and encompassing a wide range in temperature, clouds, and\nbundances of rele v ant species. Such models generally assume spaially homogeneous atmospheric conditions throughout the transit. etrie v als have been ubiquitous for interpretation of low-resolution bservations in the last decade, most notably for HST spectra in both mission and transmission geometries (e.g. Madhusudhan & Seager 009 ; Madhusudhan et al. 2014 ; Line et al. 2016 ; Barstow et al. 2017 ; enneke et al. 2019 ; Mikal-Evans et al. 2019 ; Zhang et al. 2020 ). o we ver, their use in analysing high-resolution spectra has been elatively recent (e.g. Brogi et al. 2017 ; Gandhi et al. 2019 ; Line et al. 021 ; Pelletier et al. 2021 ; Gibson et al. 2022 ), and has been made ossible thanks to the development of cross-correlation to likelihood appings (Brogi & Line 2019 ; Gibson et al. 2020 ), which allow or Bayesian analyses to be performed on the data. Ho we ver, highesolution retrie v als remain a computational challenge due to the any millions of models required at high resolutions of R 25 000 nd the various analysis techniques used to extract the planetary ignal from the noise.\nWinds in exoplanetary atmospheres have also recently been etected by a range of ground based high-resolution observations, nd result in an observable Doppler shift and/or broadening of the v erall spectrum arising from the range in velocities along the line f sight. Snellen et al. ( 2010 ) detected the winds and orbital motion f an exoplanet for the first time through high-resolution ground ased observations in the infrared. Louden & Wheatley ( 2015 ) have onstrained the eastward winds in the hot Jupiter HD189733 b hrough forward modelling of the Na absorption lines, showing hat including such dynamics is key for accurate characterization. urthermore, GCMs have also been shown to provide better fits to igh-resolution observations than 1D models that do not incorporate hermal variation and dynamical processes (Beltz et al. 2021 ). Includng winds into atmospheric models is also of particular importance, iven that there are also a growing number of high-resolution studies hat have constrained these on the terminator (Brogi et al. 2016 ; lowers et al. 2019 ; Seidel et al. 2021 ). In addition, recent work has\nNRAS 515, 749\u2013766 (2022)\nlso shown that cloud formation on the night side of UHJs is strongly ependent on the atmospheric dynamics (Komacek et al. 2022 ) and hese clouds can affect phase-dependent emission spectra.\nUltimately, what is needed is a model that is capable of interpreting he variability in the observations of a UHJ, such as WASP-76 b, hilst simultaneously incorporating dynamical processes in a statisical framework. We must include as much of the information content f a GCM whilst keeping the model computationally tractable with he minimum number of additional parameters to encompass the ele v ant physics. Such a retrie v al model must therefore be capable f constraining separate Fe abundances, thermal profiles and opacity ecks for the morning (leading) and evening (trailing) limbs, and nclude winds. The winds will act to not only transfer thermal energy nd material between the day and night sides of the atmosphere, but lso shift the spectrum for each limb according to the velocity profile.\nHere we develop HyDRA-2D, a spatially resolved retrie v al model hat incorporates separate constraints on morning and evening limbs nd a wind travelling between the day and night sides of the atmophere. Such a model represents the first step into multi-dimensional etrie v als on high-resolution data. HyDRA-2D allows for a full xploration of the parameter space using Bayesian algorithms whilst apturing the dynamical effects that can strongly influence the bserved spectra of exoplanets. We separate the atmosphere into a orning and evening limb, as these regions of the terminator exhibit ifferent velocities due to the planet\u2019s rotation, as well as different hermochemical states. This rotation therefore results in separate pectral contributions for each side.\nWe use HyDRA-2D to retrieve the two nights of ESPRESSO bservations of WASP-76 b (Ehrenreich et al. 2020 ) and determine he variability in Fe, temperature, opacity, and wind speed across each imb of the planet. Whilst there are additional transit observations f WASP-76 b observed with HARPS (Seidel et al. 2019 ; Kesseli & nellen 2021 ), we restrict ourselves to the VLT observations due o the higher signal-to-noise ratio and spectral resolution available ith ESPRESSO, which is vital for discerning the different regions f the planet that are separated by small velocity shifts. We perform wo separate retrie v als for the \u03c6 = \u22120 . 04 to \u2212 0 . 02 and 0 . 02 \u20130 . 04 hase ranges of the observations, with \u03c6 = 0 corresponding to the id-transit time. The chosen phase ranges allow us to also explore the ariation of atmospheric properties with phase, given that the region f the planetary atmosphere probed varies by \u223c30 \u25e6 between ingress nd egress (Wardenier, Parmentier & Lee 2022 ). We exclude the hases between \u03c6 = \u22120.02 and + 0.02 from our analysis owing to the oppler shadow of the star crossing the planetary signal during midransit. In addition to retrie v als with HyDRA-2D, we also perform set of spatially homogeneous 1D retrie v als across the combined hase range as well as for each of the ranges separately to compare the ifferences in the constrained parameters with model sophistication. In the next section, we discuss our HyDRA-2D retrie v al setup, ollowed by the results and discussion section where we discuss our onstraints for each side of the atmosphere and comparisons with CMs, and finally end with the concluding remarks.\nM E T H O D S\nn this section, we discuss the setup for HyDRA-2D. We retrieve wo nights of observations of the primary eclipse of WASP-76 b ith the ESPRESSO spectrograph on the VLT (Ehrenreich et al. 020 ). The observations span the optical, where Fe has prominent pacity. As these observations show strong variability in both the trength and position of the Fe signal, we must allow our retrie v al o be flexible enough to incorporate such dynamics and variability\ni u a t d a o m i F a t\n2\nW g l f o i\nS\nw o e a p\nQ\nf\nf d g\nf\nH\n\u03b3\nw c i t e\nf p Y\nf\nw T a\nTable 1.

This need for efficiency leads s to a new parametrized approach where 3D effects are encoded s extra parameters in the description of the physical properties of he atmosphere (e.g. temperature profiles, abundances and opacity ecks) and the dynamics of the atmosphere (e.g. velocity shifts nd broadening of spectral lines). We first discuss the line-by-line pacity calculations for Fe used to compute the high-resolution odel spectra. We then discuss how we separate the terminator nto two distinct regions and the retrie v al parameters for each side. ollowing this, we discuss how we incorporate the day-night wind nd limb darkening, and then describe our analysis of the data and he model sequence.\n.1 Fe opacity\ne include Fe opacity through computation of the cross-section on a rid of the rele v ant pressures and temperatures using the Kurucz line ist (Kurucz & Bell 1995 ). This line list provides the log ( gf ) value or each transition, where g is the de generac y and f refers to the scillator strength. For our work, we first compute the line strength n cm \u22121 /(atom cm \u22122 ) for each temperature T on our grid, through\n( T ) = gf \u03c0e 2\nm e c 2 exp ( \u2212c 2 E lower /T ) Q ( T ) (1 \u2212 exp ( \u2212c 2 \u03bd0 /T )) , (1)\nhere \u03bd0 = E upper \u2212 E lower , with the upper and lower state energies f the transition E upper and E lower given in cm \u22121 . The charge of an lectron, e , the speed of light c , and the mass of the electron m e are ll given in cgs units, and c 2 = 1.438 7769 cm K. In addition, the artition function Q is defined as\n( T ) = \u2211\nj\ng j exp ( \u2212c 2 E j /T ) (2)\nor a state j with de generac y g j . We apply line broadening for each of the transitions, which arises rom the radiative damping constant (natural broadening) and van er Waals broadening. These result in a Lorentzian line profile at a iv en frequenc y \u03bd (in cm \u22121 ),\nL ( \u03bd \u2212 \u03bd0 ) = 1 \u03c0\n\u03b3L\n( \u03bd \u2212 \u03bd0 ) 2 + \u03b3 2 L . (3)\nere, \u03b3 L is defined as (Sharp & Burrows 2007 )\nL = 1 4 \u03c0c\n( \u03b3W N ( T\n10 000\n)0 . 3 + \u03b3N ) , (4)\nhere \u03b3 W and \u03b3 N are the van der Waals and natural broadening oef ficients, respecti vely, and N is the number density of gas, which, n our case, consists of atomic hydrogen. For our purposes, we ignore he Stark broadening of the line, given that the atmosphere is not xpected to be highly ionized.\nIn addition to Lorentzian broadening, thermal broadening arising rom the temperature of the gas will also contribute to the o v erall rofile. This contribution results in a Gaussian line profile (e.g. Hill, urchenko & Tennyson 2013 ),\nG ( \u03bd \u2212 \u03bd0 ) = 1 \u03b3G \u221a \u03c0 exp\n( \u2212 ( \u03bd \u2212 \u03bd0 ) 2\n\u03b3 2 G\n) , (5)\n\u03b3G = \u221a 2 k b T\nm\n\u03bd0 c , (6)\nhere k b is the Boltzmann constant and m is the mass of an Fe atom. he o v erall line shape is thus a convolution between the Lorentzian nd Gaussian profile, given by the Voigt profile (e.g. Gandhi &\nadhusudhan 2017 ),\nV ( \u03bd \u2212 \u03bd0 , \u03b3L , \u03b3G ) = \u222b \u221e\n\u2212\u221e f G ( \u03bd\n\u2032 \u2212 \u03bd0 ) f L ( \u03bd \u2212 \u03bd \u2032 )d \u03bd \u2032 . (7)\nhus, the cross-section as a function of frequency for each transition ine is then computed as\nFe = S( T ) f V ( \u03bd \u2212 \u03bd0 , \u03b3L , \u03b3G ) . (8) he sum of the contributions from each line in the line list gives the\notal atomic cross-section of Fe. For each pressure and temperature n our grid, we compute the cross-section at 0.01 cm \u22121 spacing, orresponding to a resolution of R = 2.5 \u00d7 10 6 at 0.4 \u03bcm. Further etails on line broadening and computation of the cross-section can e found in Gandhi et al. ( 2020b ). We compute the o v erall opacity arising from Fe through the olume mixing ratio, X Fe , which we leave as a free parameter as isted in Table 1 . The extinction coefficient \u03c7 (in m \u22121 ) is given by\n( P , T , \u03bb) = X Fe N\u03c3Fe ( P , T , \u03bb) , (9) here \u03c3 Fe is the total cross-section of Fe and N is the total number ensity of gas. The contribution to the optical depth d \u03c4 arising from n element of the atmosphere of length d z is then\n\u03c4 = \u03c7 ( P , T , \u03bb)d z. (10) ote that we include two free parameters for the Fe abundance, one or the morning and one for the evening side, as discussed below.\n.2 Separating the morning and evening limbs\nor our work, we assume separate physical properties for the eading (or morning side) and trailing limbs (or evening side) of he terminator (see Fig. 1 ). This is because we are able to separate he spectrally contributing regions of the terminator due to their ifference in velocity space, given the high resolution ( R = 140 000) nd signal-to-noise ratio. We therefore retrieve separate Fe volume ixing ratios for the morning and evening sides of the atmosphere. n addition, we also retrieve separate pressure-temperature profiles nd opacity decks/hazes for each half of the terminator.\nMNRAS 515, 749\u2013766 (2022)\nM\nFigure 1.

We thus obtain the following parametrization or T as a function of pressure P , ( P ) = \u23a7 \u23aa \u23a8 \u23aa \u23a9 T 0 + ( ln P/P 0 \u03b11 )2 if P \u2264 P 1 , T 2 + ( ln P/P 2 \u03b12 )2 if P 1 < P \u2264 P 3 , T 3 if P > P 3 , (11) nd where we enforce P 1 \u2264 P 3 . We additionally fix P 0 = 10 \u22127 bar as he top of the model atmosphere. At lower pressures, the assumptions f hydrostatic equilibrium and local thermodynamic equilibrium egin to break do wn. We allo w the value of P 2 to vary between P 0 \u2264 2 \u2264 P 3 . Importantly, such a constraint allows for a thermal inversion\nn layer 2 in addition to isothermal and non-inverted temperature rofiles. This is done to allow the retrieval to determine the besttting P \u2212 T profile without the requirement that the temperature e monotonically decreasing with altitude. By enforcing continuity f the temperature between the three layers, we can reduce this et of equations to just six free parameters, a temperature value at n y giv en pressure, \u03b11 , \u03b12 , P 1 , P 2 , and P 3 . For our retrie v al, we etrieve the temperature at 0.1 mbar, T 0.1 mbar , which is representative f a typical photospheric pressure in transmission geometry for uch high-resolution observations. We have also verified our results y using the temperature at the top of the model atmosphere as ur free parameter, as well as with the 0.1-bar temperature as free parameter, to ensure this did not impact our constraints. he prior ranges for each parameter is shown in T able 1 . W e use ifferent sets of parameters for the evening side and morning sides, hich ensures that the temperature constraints for one side are ndependently constrained of the other, and hence o v erall we have 12 ree parameters in the retrie v al. Further details on the parametrization f the P \u2212 T profile can be found in Madhusudhan & Seager 2009 ).\nNRAS 515, 749\u2013766 (2022)\n.2.2 Grey opacity deck and haze\nn addition to the opacity resulting from the presence of gaseous Fe, ther sources of opacity may play a key role in determining the specrum. These opacities arise from of a number of factors, such as other olecular and atomic species in the atmosphere, and non-Rayleigh cattering from small particles/hazes in the atmosphere. These result n two distinct sources of extinction in the atmosphere, namely that of wavelength-independent opacity deck and a wavelength-dependent uper-Rayleigh haze. For our prescription, we adopt a one sector pproach with homogeneous opacity and haze parameters (e.g. Maconald & Madhusudhan 2017 ; Welbanks & Madhusudhan 2021 ) for ach of the morning and evening limbs. We add this source of opacity nto the o v erall e xtinction coefficient of the atmosphere, \u03c7 , as\n( P , \u03bb) = { \u03b1haze N\u03c30 ( \u03bb \u03bb0 )\u03b3haze if P \u2264 P cl , \u221e otherwise , (12)\nhere N is the total number density of gas, \u03c3 0 = 5.31 \u00d7 10 \u221231 m 2 nd \u03bb0 = 0.35 \u03bcm. Hence, the free parameters are \u03b1haze , \u03b3 haze , and cl , whose prior ranges are given in Table 1 . This therefore results n six free parameters in our retrie v al, gi ven that we assume the two ides of the atmosphere are independent. The o v erall opacity of each ide of the atmosphere is thus the sum of the contributions arising rom Fe line absorption and the opacity deck/haze. Further details n the opacity deck/haze prescription can be found in Welbanks & adhusudhan ( 2021 ).\n.2.3 Computing the unbroadened spectrum\ne compute the unbroadened spectrum using numerical radiative ransfer for each side of the atmosphere (e.g. Welbanks & Madusudhan 2021 ). This involves computation of the transit depth e nd m for the evening and morning sides, and is given by\ne ( \u03bb) = 1 2 1\nR 2 s\n( R 2 p + 2 \u222b \u221e R p b e (1 \u2212 e \u2212\u03c4e ( \u03bb) ) d b e\n\u2212 2 \u222b R p\n0 b e e\n\u2212\u03c4e ( \u03bb) d b e ) , (13)\nm ( \u03bb) = 1 2 1\nR 2 s\n( R 2 p + 2 \u222b \u221e R p b m (1 \u2212 e \u2212\u03c4m ( \u03bb) ) d b m\n\u2212 2 \u222b R p\n0 b m e\n\u2212\u03c4m ( \u03bb) d b m ) , (14)\nFigure 2. Schematic of the broadening prescription used for HyDRA-2D. We first compute the unbroadened evening and morning transit depths using the parameters for each side (see T able 1 ). W e then convolve this spectrum with the rotational broadening kernel for each side. The evening side is rotating towards the observer and the morning side is rotating away, and thus are blueshifted and redshifted, respectively. We then shift and broaden both sides by a day-night wind with V sys , and \u03b4V wind , which are free parameters in the retrie v al. We then combine the spectra for each limb after incorporating the stellar limb darkening and model reprocessing, as discussed in Sections 2.4 and 2.5 .\nw \u03c4 T t f t o R l d ( c\n2\nO a t f t ( i o\n2\nW e t e s r a a\nR\nW a a i fi W t\ni r d\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/515/1/749/6615469 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nhere R p and R s refer to the radius of the planet and star respectively, refers to the optical depth, and the impact parameter is given by b . he subscripts e and m refer to the evening and morning sides, and he factor of 1/2 accounts for the fact that each side is only integrated or half of the limb. The physical properties of each side such as emperature and Fe abundance are variable, and thus the o v erall ptical depth for each side is different. We set our reference radius p = 1 . 854 R J at 10 \u22122 bar reference pressure, but the chosen pressure evel has no effect on the retrieval given the high-pass filtering in the ata analysis remo v es an y of fset between dif ferent chosen pressures see Section 2.5 ). The spectrum for each side is then broadened and ombined as discussed below. .3 Incorporating winds\nnce we have computed the transit spectra for each side of the tmosphere, we must broaden them according to the rotation of he planet and the winds present in the atmosphere. The procedure or this broadening is shown in Fig. 2 . This setup was moti v ated hrough recent work on general circulation models by Wardenier et al. 2021 ), which showed that the broadened primary eclipse spectrum s significantly altered and therefore requires careful consideration f both aspects for accurate spectral modelling.\n.3.1 Planetary rotation\ne first begin by applying the planetary rotation to each side. The vening side, or trailing limb, is rotating towards the observer and he morning side, or leading limb, is rotating away. Therefore, the vening and morning sides will be blueshifted and redshifted, repectively, according to the rotation of the planet. However, the polar egions of the terminator will be rotating more slowly than the equator nd hence there is also a contribution arising at lower v elocities. F or rotation velocity, V rot , the full rotation kernel is given by\n( x) = {\n1 \u03c0 \u221a 1 \u2212x 2 /V 2 rot if | x| < V rot\n0 otherwise . (15)\ne only apply half of the kernel for each half of the terminator, s shown in Fig. 2 . This convolves our unbroadened spectrum ccording to the respective kernel for each side, which also results n a net shift for each side. We keep the rigid-body rotation kernel xed for each model in our retrie v al as the rotational velocity of ASP-76 b is well kno wn, gi ven that the planet is expected to be idally locked (e.g. Showman & Guillot 2002 ). An example spectrum highlighting the effect of the broadening s shown in Fig. 3 for a small region near \u223c0.4 \u03bcm. The rotation esults in a split of the o v erall line profiles in the spectrum, with two istinguishable peaks in the rotationally broadened spectrum arising\nMNRAS 515, 749\u2013766 (2022)\nM\nf t p r s e\n2\nI b s w R i a t fi h a e I e i t f\np v h o P v s k c i d o\nFigure 4.

The impact parameter of the transit is given by b . For the evening and morning side limb-dark ening f actors, we calculate the brightness at the blue and red points, respectively (see Section 2.4 ).\na u\nn\n\u03b4 t w r a b W d\n2\nF a s t t v\no o\nx\nw a F d t j t c\nx\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/515/1/749/6615469 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nrom contributions from each half of the terminator. In addition, he spectrum is more spread in wavelength and therefore the sharp eak arising from Fe line opacity in the unbroadened spectrum has educed in extent. Such rotation is therefore vital to account for as it ignificantly alters the line profile, and may otherwise lead to biased stimates of abundance. .3.2 Day-night wind n addition to the rotation, a day-night wind also contributes to the roadening of the o v erall spectrum. General circulation models have hown that the highest velocity winds are at the lowest pressures, ith deeper regions having almost no wind present (e.g. Millericci Kempton & Rauscher 2012 ; Wardenier et al. 2021 ). Therefore ncident rays of light from the host star that pass through the tmosphere first encounter a strong wind at the top of the atmosphere, hen pass through to higher pressures with a lower wind speed, and nally exit out of the atmosphere through the lower pressures with igher wind speeds again. This path thus results in a net blueshift s well as a spread in the spectrum due to the range in velocities ncountered by the rays of light passing through the atmosphere. n addition, there will also be a spread caused by the wind speed ven if it is constant with depth, given that the projected velocity nto the observer\u2019s reference frame varies as the path travels through he atmosphere. There may also be an additional contribution arising rom variation of the winds with latitude.\nTo account for these physical mechanisms and processes, we arametrize the wind with a velocity shift from the known systemic elocity, V sys , and a spread in its value given by the full width at alf-maximum (FWHM) \u03b4V wind (see Fig. 2 ). The V sys parameter is ften included in high-resolution analyses (e.g. Birkby et al. 2013 ; ino et al. 2020 ; Giacobbe et al. 2021 ), given that the systemic elocity often has some measurement uncertainty that we may be ensiti ve to. Ho we ver, in our case, the V sys parameter is very precisely nown at \u22121.17 \u00b1 0.02 km s \u22121 (Ehrenreich et al. 2020 ) and thus we an assume that any deviation V sys can be attributed to the winds n the atmosphere. We also include one additional parameter, the eviation from the planet\u2019s known orbital velocity, K p , as this ften has a de generac y with the V sys value. We therefore have three\nNRAS 515, 749\u2013766 (2022)\ndditional parameters in HyDRA-2D to account for the wind and its ncertainty, K p , V sys , and \u03b4V wind as shown in Table 1 . Fig. 3 shows the effect of applying the wind broadening. We ow see a net blueshift in the spectrum as a result of the wind V sys , and an additional spread in the line profile as a result of V wind . Note that the spectrum is significantly more spread than he unbroadened spectrum shifted by 10 km s \u22121 , and therefore the ind and rotation have a strong effect on our retrieved results. The esulting spectral-line profile for this broadened model with rotation nd wind is similar to the type of line distortions and shifts predicted y GCMs (e.g. Showman et al. 2013 ; Rauscher & Kempton 2014 ). e are therefore confident that our parametrization can address the iversity of potential line profiles.\n.4 Stellar limb darkening\nor each spectrally broadened half of the terminator, we must also pply limb darkening, given that the brightness of WASP-76\u2019s stellar urface varies significantly in the optical. As the retrie v als are o v er he first and last quarter of the transit, the brightness and therefore he relative contributions of the morning and evening side will thus ary with the orbital phase.\nFig. 4 shows the setup to compute the limb darkening for each side f the atmosphere. We first compute the value of x for a given phase f the observations \u03c6, normalized by the stellar radius R s , given by\n= a sin (2 \u03c0\u03c6) R s , (16)\nhere a refers to the semi-major axis of the orbit. We must then add nd subtract R p / R s for the morning and evening sides, respectively. or simplicity we do not integrate the contribution of the limb arkening o v er the half-annulus of each side, but take its value at he red and blue points in Fig. 4 for the morning and evening. This is ustified, given that there is no significant variability in the limb o v er he half-annuli and given that the modal contribution to the spectrum omes from these points. For each side, we thus obtain\ne = a sin (2 \u03c0\u03c6) R s \u2212 R p R s , (17)\nFigure 5. Example showing the data analysis steps that were performed. The top panel shows a small slice in wavelength of the pipeline-reduced ESPRESSO spectra taken during the transit on 2018 October 30. Each of the 69 rows is a different spectrum that has been shifted to the star\u2019s rest frame. Vertical dark lines are stellar absorption lines. The colour bar shows the pixel values of the spectra. In the middle panel, the spectra have been corrected for changes in signal-to-noise ratio and any difference in the blaze function that occur throughout the night, which remo v es the horizontal banding seen in the top panel. The bottom panel shows the residuals that are left after the stellar spectrum was remo v ed by dividing by the average out-of-transit spectrum. The exoplanet\u2019s signal is hidden in the noise, and is extracted using cross-correlation.\nx\nw W o\n\u03bc\n\u03bc\nT 2 t\nI\nS\nI\nF e\ne w v e t t f\n2\nA d\ns a d\nt B l p r ( t t ( N d n f b s t o s\nb v\nV\nw p s u a\n1 https:// dace.unige.ch/ dashboard/ index.html .\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/515/1/749/6615469 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nm = a sin (2 \u03c0\u03c6) R s + R p R s , (18) ith the morning side given by x m and the evening side given by x e . e then compute the radial distance \u03bc of the points from the centre f the star, e = \u221a 1 \u2212 x 2 e \u2212 b 2 , (19) m = \u221a 1 \u2212 x 2 m \u2212 b 2 . (20) he impact parameter b is assumed to be 0.027 (Ehrenreich et al. 020 ). We then compute the o v erall limb-darkening function, giv en he quadratic limb-darkening coefficients u 1 and u 2 : e ( \u03c6) = { 1 \u2212 u 1 (1 \u2212 \u03bce ) \u2212 u 2 (1 \u2212 \u03bce ) 2 if x 2 e \u2264 1 \u2212 b 2 , 0 elsewhere . (21) imilarly for the morning side, we obtain m ( \u03c6) = { 1 \u2212 u 1 (1 \u2212 \u03bcm ) \u2212 u 2 (1 \u2212 \u03bcm ) 2 if x 2 m \u2264 1 \u2212 b 2 , 0 elsewhere . (22) or our work, we have taken u 1 = 0.393 and u 2 = 0.219 (Ehrenreich t al. 2020 ).\nWe obtain the o v erall spectrum by simply scaling the model for ach side by the value of I and summing (see equation 25 ). Hence, ith this limb-darkening model, we are able to account for the ariation in the contributions for each side across the transit; the vening side is the dominant contributor during the latter half of the ransit and vice versa for the morning in the first half. In addition, he model ensures that at ingress and egress we obtain a contribution rom just one side in the o v erall spectrum.\n.5 Data analysis and model r epr ocessing\ns the data are the same that were used in Kesseli et al. ( 2022 ), the ata are cleaned and processed in a similar way. We summarize the\nteps here (see Fig. 5 ), but for more details on the observing strategy nd initial data reduction, see Ehrenreich et al. ( 2020 ), and for more etails on the spectral cleaning steps, see Kesseli et al. ( 2022 ). We downloaded the pipeline reduced ESPRESSO spectra from he Data and Analysis Center for Exoplanets (D A CE) data base. 1\nefore any other steps, we correct the spectra for telluric absorption ines due to H 2 O and O 2 using Molecfit (Smette et al. 2015 ). Molecfit erforms especially well for shallow absorption lines, but is known to eturn poor results for the line cores of the strongest absorption lines e.g. Allart et al. 2017 ). For this reason, we mask all pixels where he transmission through the atmosphere is less than 40 per cent. We hen correct for velocity shifts due to the reflex motion of the star K \u2217), the barycentric velocity ( v bar ), and the system velocity ( v sys ). ext, we perform a 5 \u03c3 clipping to remove any spurious flux spikes ue to cosmic rays (top panel of Fig. 5 ). To remo v e an y broad-band oise present in the spectra while preserving the o v erall shape, we ollow Merritt et al. ( 2020 ) and place the spectra on a \u2018common\u2019 laze using a high-pass filter with a width of 200 pixels ( \u223c100 km \u22121 ; middle panel of Fig. 5 ). Finally, we interpolate each spectrum on o the same wavelength grid and divide each spectrum by the average ut-of-transit stellar spectrum to remo v e the contribution from host tar (bottom panel of Fig. 5 ).\nTo process our model, we must reproduce the model data cube, eginning first by Doppler shifting the spectrum at each phase by its elocity, V p . At a given phase \u03c6( t ), the shift is given by\np ( \u03c6) = V sys + ( K p + K p ) sin (2 \u03c0\u03c6( t)) , (23) here K p = 196 km s \u22121 is the planet\u2019s rotation velocity. The V sys arameter is the day-night wind velocity and represents an overall hift in the planet\u2019s spectrum. We also include K p to account for ncertainties in the measured value of K p and because there is often de generac y between the K p and V sys parameters as a result of the\nMNRAS 515, 749\u2013766 (2022)\nM\nl w\n\u03bb\nw fi\nw\nr \u03bb i i a w a\nc l l W\nw\ns\ns\nR\nH s t m w n f L r T u s i s a c r a\n2\nW t E o o\nFigure 6. Schematic showing the different regions of the morning (leading) and evening (trailing) limb probed during the transit.

During egress, the stellar rays pass through more of the say side of the evening and the night side of the morning.\nr w 2 p t a c m a r ( e 1\na t w w u t u r e o t T s\nt 0 p m r S b o 2 f t r\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/515/1/749/6615469 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nimited phase range that we are exploring during the transit. The new avelengths of the shifted spectrum are\n( \u03c6) = \u03bb0 \u221a\n1 + V p ( \u03c6) /c 1 \u2212 V p ( \u03c6) /c , (24)\nhere \u03bb0 is the wavelength of the unshifted spectrum. Therefore, the nal combined spectrum for the terminator is given by\nshift ( \u03c6) = \u2032 e ( \u03bb( \u03c6)) I e ( \u03c6) + \u2032 m ( \u03bb( \u03c6)) I m ( \u03c6) , (25) here I e and I m refer to the stellar limb-darkening factors, and \u2032 e and \u2032 m refer to the evening and morning side transit depths that have been otationally and wind broadened and shifted to the new wavelengths ( \u03c6) for each phase. One important final step we take with our model s to apply a high-pass filter, which remo v es an y slo wly v arying trends n the model and reproduces the data sequence. The high-pass filter lso acts to remo v e the continuum from the spectra, which means that e are only sensitive to the spectral-line features that are generated bo v e the continuum. Once we have a processed spectrum for the atmosphere, we must ompare this to the observations of WASP-76 b and determine the ikelihood. We use the cross-correlation to log-likelihood (CC-toogL) map of Brogi & Line ( 2019 ) to compare our model to the data.\ne do this by computing\nlog L = \u2212N 2 log ( s 2 f + s 2 g \u2212 2 R) , (26) here\n2 f =\n1\nN N \u2211 n = 0 f 2 ( n ) , (27)\n2 g =\n1\nN N \u2211 n = 0 g 2 ( n \u2212 s) , (28)\n= 1 N N \u2211 n = 0 f ( n ) g( n \u2212 s) . (29)\nere, f and g are the data and model, respectively, for a model with N pectral points, and s represents the wavelength offset. This form of he likelihood accounts for the o v erall line shape as well as position;\nodels that poorly match the observations or are scaled incorrectly ill be penalized by the R term and thus less fa v oured. We ha ve two ights of observations for WASP-76 b, and so we sum the likelihood or each night to obtain the o v erall value. The method in Brogi & ine ( 2019 ) also prescribes reprocessing each tested model, i.e. eproducing the effects of the data analysis on the model spectrum. his reprocessing is necessary in the infrared because algorithms sed to remo v e telluric lines are known to alter the exoplanet pectrum as well. Ho we ver, our analysis in the optical is based on the n-transit/out-of-transit approach and does not distort the planetary ignal, and therefore the depth and shape of planet\u2019s spectral lines re preserv ed relativ e to the stellar spectrum. We can therefore ompare each model to the observations directly, without significant eprocessing of the model. Further details on the likelihood method nd deri v ation can be found in Brogi & Line ( 2019 ).\n.6 Retrieval setup\ne retrieve the high-resolution observations of WASP-76 b, with wo transits obtained on 2018 September 2 and October 30 with the SPRESSO spectrograph on the VLT (Ehrenreich et al. 2020 ). These bservations are some of the highest signal-to-noise atmospheric bservations with high-resolution spectra, obtained at a spectral\nNRAS 515, 749\u2013766 (2022)\nesolution of R = 140 000 in the optical. We use the 0.4\u20130.8 \u03bcm avelength range for our retrie v als. We set up HyDRA-2D with 3 free parameters, which are given in Table 1 . This includes 10 arameters for each of the morning and evening sides, representing he Fe abundance, temperature profile (6 parameters), and opacity nd haze deck (3 parameters), and 3 additional parameters that are onsistent for both sides, K p , V sys , and \u03b4V wind . Each spectral odel is generated at a spectral resolution of R = 500 000, assuming planet radius of 1 . 854 R J , planet mass of 0 . 894 M J , and stellar adius 1 . 756 R . We use the Nested Sampling algorithm MultiNest Feroz & Hobson 2008 ; Feroz, Hobson & Bridges 2009 ; Buchner t al. 2014 ) for parameter estimation with HyDRA-2D, adopting 000 live points. We perform two separate retrie v als, in the \u03c6 = \u22120 . 04 to \u2212 0 . 02 nd 0 . 02 \u20130 . 04 phase ranges, leaving out the phases in between due o the Doppler shadow of the star. The transit of the planet occurs ithin \u22120.0432 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 0.0432 and the whole planet is in the transit ithin the phases of \u22120.035 \u2264 \u03c6 \u2264 0.035. We choose to use phases p to \u00b10.04 for our retrie v al as at least one side of the planet is in he transit within this range. We have performed tests varying the pper phase range but we did not see any significant difference in the etrie ved parameters gi ven that the signal is weaker near ingress and gress due to the dimmer stellar limbs. The two separate retrie v als v er the phase ranges probe differing regions of the atmosphere due o the planet\u2019s rotation angle of \u223c30 \u25e6 during the transit (see Fig. 6 ). his allows us to explore variations within the morning and evening ide as the transit progresses and compare any differences.\nTo compare our results with HyDRA-2D, we also perform a spaially homogeneous retrie v al across the combined \u03c6 = \u22120 . 04 to \u2212 . 02 and 0 . 02 \u20130 . 04 ranges, which we refer to as the combinedhase 1D-retrie v al. We also perform two additional spatially hoogeneous retrie v als for the \u03c6 = \u22120 . 04 to \u2212 0 . 02 and 0 . 02 \u20130 . 04 anges separately (referred to as the separated-phase 1D-retrie v als). uch spatially homogeneous retrie v als are well established and have een used to analyse HST as well as ground-based high-resolution bservations (e.g. Brogi & Line 2019 ; Gandhi et al. 2019 ; Line et al. 021 ). We assume uniform Fe abundance across the whole terminator or these 1D-retrie v als, with a single pressure-temperature profile for he atmosphere and uniform opacity deck and haze. Hence for each etrie v al we have 13 free parameters, including K p , V sys , and\nFigure 7.

The orange and red histograms give the constraints for the evening, and the purple and blue show the constraints for the morning.

When applying the spectral broadening to these models we ake the full rotational kernel for both halves of the atmosphere. urther details on the retrie v al setup for the 1D retrie v als can be ound in Gandhi & Madhusudhan ( 2018 ) and Gandhi et al. ( 2019 ). RESULTS A N D DISCUSSION n this section we discuss the results of the HyDRA-2D retrie v als n the WASP-76 b observations. We show the constraints for Fe in ig. 7 and the constraints on the temperature profile and opacity eck in Fig. 8 . These indicate that the median values and their rrors vary significantly between the evening and morning, and etween the retrie v als across the \u03c6 = \u22120 . 04 to \u2212 0 . 02 and 0 . 02 \u20130 . 04 hase ranges. Table 2 also shows that HyDRA-2D offers a better tatistical fit the observations for the \u03c6 = \u22120 . 04 to \u2212 0 . 02 range v er traditional spatially homogeneous approaches. This therefore ighlights the need for such modelling capabilities in order to f fecti vely constrain atmospheric parameters and resolve spatial ifferences between the two sides. On the other hand, we find that for he last quarter of the transit the evening side dominates the signal, ith little contribution from the morning side, and hence the 1D etrie v al sho ws almost equal e vidence. We discuss the constraints for ach of the various parameters in detail below. .1 Comparison to spatially homogeneous models\ne compare our constraints on Fe with more traditional 1D modlling approaches, where homogeneous terminator properties are ssumed. We find that our spatially homogeneous combined-phase D retrie v al obtains strong constraints on the Fe abundance, with og ( X Fe ) = \u22124 . 33 + 0 . 26 \u22120 . 27 (see Table 2 ). When we perform separate rerie v als for each of the phase ranges, we find that the abundance contraints no w sho w some dif ferences. The separate-phase 1D retrie v al etrieves log ( X Fe ) = \u22124 . 89 + 0 . 43 \u22120 . 45 for the \u03c6 = \u22120 . 04 to \u2212 0 . 02 range. n the other hand, the signal from the last quarter of the transit closely\natches the Fe abundance constraint from the combined-phase 1D etrie v al. Therefore, the combined-phase retrie v al constrains the most ignificant contribution to the Fe signal, which comes from the latter uarter, consistent with previous studies (Ehrenreich et al. 2020 ; esseli & Snellen 2021 ). Given the differences in the constrained bundance, it is therefore unsurprising that the separated-phase 1D etrie v als are statistically preferred by 3.8 \u03c3 . This indicates that the v erall atmospheric structure is not as well modelled by assuming omogeneous physical properties across the transit. The HyDRA-2D constraints go further by exploring the variation n Fe o v er the terminator for each of the phase ranges. The evening ides of the spatially resolved retrie v als sho w remarkably similar onstraints to the separated-phase 1D retrie v als (see Fig. 7 and able 2 ). For both phase ranges the evening side is thus the ominant side of the planet\u2019s Fe signal, which remains true for he \u03c6 = \u22120 . 04 to \u2212 0 . 02 range even though the evening side\u2019s bundance is constrained to be lower than for the morning. This is ecause the spectral contribution resulting from a lower abundance s offset by the much deeper opacity deck for the evening side (see ection 3.4 and Fig. 8 ), thus maintaining a stronger contribution o the o v erall signal. The statistical preference for HyDRA-2D and he separated-phase 1D retrie v als o v er the combined-phase retrie v al s driven primarily by differences in the temperature and the wind peeds (see Sections 3.3 and 3.5 ), with a weaker effect caused by the hemical inhomogeneities of Fe in the atmosphere. This is consistent ith previous work by Beltz et al. ( 2021 ) comparing high-resolution bservations in emission with general circulation models. We also calculate terminator -a veraged ab undances from HyDRAD and compare these to our separated-phase 1D retrie v als for each f the phase ranges we study, as shown in Fig. 9 . We do this to nvestigate the potential biases that may arise by assuming spatial omogeneity. We calculate the average abundance of the terminator rom HyDRA-2D through two methods. First, we use the arithmetic ean of Fe across the two terminators. Our second method employs more sophisticated temperature-weighted geometric mean, which\nMNRAS 515, 749\u2013766 (2022)\nM\nFigure 8. Constraints on the Fe, temperature profile, and opacity deck for WASP-76 b with HyDRA-2D. At the top of the figure, we show a schematic of the region of the atmosphere probed by the retrie v als, with the corresponding constraints for each region highlighted below. For the Fe histograms the blue error bar indicates the 1 \u03c3 confidence interval and the red dashed line shows the solar value of Fe (see Fig. 7 ). The bottom panels show the 1 \u03c3 and 2 \u03c3 confidence interval for the P \u2013 T profile in the darker and lighter shades, respectively, with the median value given by the solid curve. Similarly, we highlight the constraints on the opacity deck and its 1 \u03c3 and 2 \u03c3 confidence interval in the darker and lighter grey. Note that this is the uncertainty in the pressure of the top of the opacity deck, and the observed spectrum is not sensitive to higher pressures as the opacity deck is optically thick.\nh t M t a o n t\nr t\nt l o s s t t r t o r\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/515/1/749/6615469 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nas been shown to provide a better prescription for averaged erminator abundances for low-resolution observations (Welbanks &\nadhusudhan 2022 ). This calculation does implicitly assume that he cross-section between the two sides does not vary significantly, s we do not weight each side by the o v erall opacity for each half f the terminator. Ho we ver, we can justify this given that we do ot expect significant variation in the opacity o v er the range of the emperature constraints.\nThe averaged values are consistent with each other for both phase anges given the relatively little difference in abundance between he two sides. Our 1D retrie v al is in fact most closely matching\nNRAS 515, 749\u2013766 (2022)\nhe evening side abundance from HyDRA-2D (see Fig. 7 ). This is ikely due to the fact that with the high-resolution R = 140 000 bservations of ESPRESSO we obtain separate signals from each ide of the atmosphere due to their difference in velocity. Hence the ignals from each side of the atmosphere are not completely blended ogether, as would be the case for low-resolution observations, and hus for our high-resolution observations the spatially unresolved etrie v als converge to the stronger signal. The last quarter of the ransit ( \u03c6 = 0 . 02 \u20130 . 04) shows similar constraints for both methods f averaging the abundance as the constraint from the morning is elatively weak and thus dominated by the evening side.\nTable 2.

We ee a tight well-constrained abundance of log ( X Fe ) = \u22124 . 03 + 0 . 28 \u22120 . 31 , lightly abo v e the solar value of log ( X Fe ) = \u22124.52 (Asplund t al. 2009 ), but consistent with the metallicity of the host star, Fe/H] = 0.366. Ho we ver, our highest abundance estimate for Fe in act comes from the morning of the \u03c6 = \u22120 . 04 to \u2212 0 . 02 range, ith log ( X Fe ) = \u22123 . 83 + 0 . 51 \u22120 . 59 . Although, it should be noted that this stimate has a higher uncertainty. Both of these regions of the tmosphere with the highest abundance estimates probe more of he day side of the atmosphere, i.e. that is being irradiated due to he geometry of the transit (see Fig. 8 ). Hence, it is unsurprising hat we obtain the tightest constraints for these regions, as the day ide is expected to have the strongest Fe signal given the hotter emperatures, as discussed in Section 3.3 .\nOur morning side constraint for the \u03c6 = 0 . 02 \u20130 . 04 range has he lowest abundance and the weakest constraint, at log ( X Fe ) =\n4 . 59 + 0 . 85 \u22121 . 0 , as the evening side dominates the overall signal. The tellar limb darkening also acts against the signal from the morning ide for the latter half of the transit, as this side occults more of the immer limbs of the star. Given the wider uncertainty for the morning ide, it is unsurprising that the 1D retrie v al sho ws a similar e vidence nd constrains an Fe abundance that closely matches the evening. urther observations of the transit of WASP-76 b may constrain he Fe signal from the morning more definitively, particularly with\nigh-resolution ( R \u223c140 000) observations that are able to resolve the eading and trailing limbs.\nWe find that the abundance constraints for the sides probing ore of the night side, i.e. \u03c6 = \u22120 . 04 to \u2212 0 . 02 evening side\nnd \u03c6 = 0 . 02 \u20130 . 04 morning side, have lower median values by 0.8 dex, indicating that some Fe rain-out may be occurring across he terminator, as suggested by Ehrenreich et al. ( 2020 ) for the orning side. This rain-out is also consistent with recent work on loud formation on UHJs by Gao & Powell ( 2021 ) that showed hat the Fe abundance could potentially decrease by \u223c1 dex due o it condensing. Ho we ver, we note that the chemical abundance ifferences between the various regions of the atmosphere are enerally quite small and broadly consistent with each other, and ifferences in the temperature and wind speeds have a higher impact n the o v erall spectrum.\n.2.1 Mass\u2013metallicity relation\nig. 10 shows our most precise abundance estimate for Fe, that f the evening side for the last quarter of the transit, along with revious measurements of various species in Solar System planets\nMNRAS 515, 749\u2013766 (2022)\nM\na s g t F c O t a e a ( s o s\nb p ( i w m B a t m\n3\nO b s f a o T p o i e t w w i i o \u03c6 g\na H c w w a i a t o 2 o c\nFigure 11.

As chemical models of the atmospheres of uch hot objects have shown (e.g. Visscher, Lodders & Fegley 2010 ), aseous iron is expected to be the dominant proportion of the Fe, and hus a good estimate of the total Fe content of the atmosphere. The e measurement of an exoplanet atmosphere also provides a direct omparison against the stellar abundance (e.g. Thiabaud et al. 2015 ). ur retrieved value lies in between the stellar metallicity and the rend from the Solar system planets. In addition to WASP-76 b, we lso show the Fe abundance measured for WASP-121 b (Gibson t al. 2020 ), an UHJ with an equilibrium temperature of \u223c2400 K, nd the CO abundance constraints from other high-resolution studies Gandhi et al. 2019 ; Line et al. 2021 ; Pelletier et al. 2021 ). These how good agreement with our result, as well as the previous work f Welbanks et al. ( 2019 ), which found species other than oxygen at tellar- or superstellar abundances.\nThe Fe abundance is of particular importance given that it can e used to determine the refractory-to-volatile abundance ratio. This rovides a unique window into the formation and migration scenarios Lothringer et al. 2021 ). As the Fe accreted on to the planet must be n the form of solids, it allows us to break the de generac y often seen ith volatile species, where the carbon and oxygen bearing species ay be accreted as either solids or gases (e.g. O\u0308berg, Murray-Clay & ergin 2011 ; Mordasini et al. 2016 ). Further observations of UHJs nd constraints on their refractory species will help us to discern he trends and allow us to compare with the volatile abundances\neasured from observations in the infrared.\n.3 Variation in the thermal structure\nur retrieved temperature and its constraints do sho w v ariation etween the evening and morning sides as well as with phase, as hown in Fig. 8 . These show that the temperature is best constrained or the evening side towards the end of the transit, where we retrieve hot photosphere of T 0 . 1mb = 2950 + 111 \u2212156 K. On the other hand, we btain a lower median temperature with a wider uncertainty of 0 . 1 mbar = 2615 + 266 \u2212275 K for the morning side for the \u03c6 = 0 . 02 \u20130 . 04 hase range. The constraints for both phase ranges show that the parts f the atmosphere that are irradiated show the highest temperatures, n line with expectations from general circulation models (Wardenier t al. 2021 ; Savel et al. 2022 ). For all of our temperature constraints, he profiles also appear largely isothermal, and generally show a idening uncertainty at pressures higher than the opacity deck here the observations are unable to probe. GCMs indicate thermal nversions for the upper photosphere for the day side, although these nversions are generally consistent with the retrieved uncertainty in ur temperature profiles for all cases except the evening side for the = 0 . 02 \u20130 . 04 range, where our error is more tightly constrained, iven the higher signal-to-noise ratio. We compare our temperature constraints to previous analyses nd other observations of the primary transit of WASP-76 b. igh-resolution observations using the CARMENES spectrograph onstrained a higher temperature of \u223c2700\u20133700 K range, consistent ith our temperature profiles (Landman et al. 2021 ). Recent analyses ith the ESPRESSO and HARPS observations in the optical detected temperature of \u223c3300\u20133400 K (Seidel et al. 2019 , 2021 ), which s higher than our temperature for even the hottest part of the tmosphere, namely the evening side for the last quarter of the ransit. Ho we ver, Von Essen et al. ( 2020 ) used low-resolution HST bservations in the optical and found temperature constraints of 300 + 412 \u2212392 K, while Edwards et al. ( 2020 ) analysed HST WFC3 bservations in the infrared and obtained 2231 + 265 \u2212283 K. Fu et al. ( 2021 ) ombined the WFC3 and Spitzer observations and found that the best-\nNRAS 515, 749\u2013766 (2022)\ntting temperature was 2000 K from forward models. These lowesolution constraints point to a temperature that is generally lower han we observe, but still consistent at \u223c1.5 \u03c3 with our constraint or the morning side 0.1-mbar temperature for both phase ranges. he differences may be reconciled, given that the high-resolution bservations in our work are probing a higher altitude than the lowesolution observations and thus may obtain a higher temperature if here is a stratosphere present, as indicated from day-side analysis f HST observations (Fu et al. 2021 ). In future, combining the highesolution and lo w-resolution observ ations may help to constrain the hermal profile to a greater extent (e.g. Brogi & Line 2019 ; Gandhi t al. 2019 ) and shed light on the potential differences seen in the onstrained temperature of the terminator.\nWe have performed retrie v als assuming an H 2 /He- and an H/Heich atmosphere, and find that the H/He-rich case (where the H 2 s dissociated) offers a substantially better fit to the observations. his is because the atmospheric composition is intricately linked to he o v erall constrained temperature. Such a dissociated atmosphere, onsisting primarily of H and He, would be a lower mean molecular eight o v er an H 2 - and He-rich atmosphere by a factor of almost 2. herefore, the scaleheight, given by H = k b T / \u03bcg , is almost double for n H/He-rich atmosphere o v er an H 2 /He-rich atmosphere. Modelling f circulation on UHJs has shown that the majority of the dayide atmosphere is H 2 -dissociated at pressures \u223c0.1 bar (Bell & owan 2018 ; Tan & Komacek 2019 ). In the upper atmosphere \u223c10 \u22124 bar) where our observations are more sensitiv e, we e xpect a ignificant majority of the hydrogen in the atmosphere to be thermally issociated, as shown in Fig. 11 . Therefore, our retrie v als with an 2 /He-rich atmosphere constrained unphysically high temperatures f 3800 K in order to match the strength of the features in the obserations. Furthermore, we also find that the H 2 /He-rich retrie v als were tatistically disfa v oured, and thus find evidence for an atmosphere hat is dissociated. The recombination of H into H 2 on the morning ide of the last quarter of the transit may also be a potential reason or its lack of significant signal compared to the evening side, as its caleheight would be decreased by a factor of \u223c2 o v er the evening n addition to any difference in temperature and Fe abundance.\nWe do observe a weak thermal inversion for the evening side n the \u03c6 = \u22120 . 04 to \u2212 0 . 02 range. This may be driven by a otential thermal inversion from the day side remaining present at he terminator, and detectable, given the deeper opacity deck for this art of the atmosphere (see Section 3.4 ). Numerous strong optical\nFigure 12. Posterior distribution of our retrie v als of WASP-76 b highlighting the de generac y between Fe abundance and opacity deck.

We note ho we ver that the retrie v ed inv ersion may also be aused by the recombination of H 2 in the deep atmosphere. At high ressures, the H 2 is present at significant abundance as shown in ig. 11 . This increases the mean molecular weight and thus reduces he scaleheight. Hence our retrie v al with the H/He-rich atmosphere ay act to reduce the apparent scaleheight in the lower atmosphere y lowering the temperature at higher pressures, and thus appear as a hermal inversion. We tested our temperature profile parametrization as not the root cause of this inversion by testing various pressures here the temperature was set instead of 0.1 mbar, and also varying he lower prior on P 1 and P 2 , but these did not impact our results. We o note ho we ver that the inversion is weak ( \u223c300 K) and consistent ith an isotherm as these high-resolution terminator observations re only indirectly sensitive to the temperature profile from its effect n the scaleheight. We performed an additional retrie v al that did ot allow thermal inversions in the atmosphere and observed no ignificant change to our parameter estimates, further indicating that he inversion not too significant. .4 Opacity deck\nhe constraints for the opacity deck are given in Fig. 8 . The range in ressures constrained for the top of the cloud deck in Fig. 8 represents he uncertainty, and the spectrum is not sensitive to pressures below his as the opacity deck is assumed to be optically thick. The retrie v als how that there is a high-opacity deck/continuum present for the sides f the atmosphere that are probing most strongly the day side of the tmosphere, and our signal for Fe is probing the upper atmosphere bo v e the opacity deck. The source of this opacity likely arises from pecies such as H- and/or other atomic species that may be pre v alent n the atmosphere, as condensation of cloud species is unlikely on he day side for such a hot day side. This is backed up by the\numerous species that have also been detected in the atmosphere ith significant optical opacity (Tabernero et al. 2021 ; Kesseli et al. 022 ). We note that species such as TiO or VO also have strong ptical opacity and are capable of leading to thermal inversions Hubeny, Burrows & Sudarsky 2003 ; Fortney et al. 2008 ; Piette t al. 2020 ), but there is no evidence for these species from the highesolution observations (Tabernero et al. 2021 ). On the other hand, ur results for the non-irradiated regions of the atmosphere show a eeper opacity deck, indicating that the night sides may be relatively ree of any strong optical absorbers. Cloud formation modelling has hown that the night side should possess significant cloud opacity due o silicate clouds (Gao & Powell 2021 ). Such clouds form at pressures f 10 \u22122 \u201310 \u22123 bar, depending on the temperature, consistent with ur opacity decks for the night side of log ( P cl / bar ) = \u22122 . 08 + 0 . 44 \u22120 . 53 evening side, \u03c6 = \u22120 . 04 to \u2212 0 . 02) and log ( P cl / bar ) = \u22123 . 33 + 0 . 80 \u22120 . 91 morning side, \u03c6 = 0 . 02 \u20130 . 04). Recent work has also shown that atchy clouds may be present on the night side of UHJs but that they nly weakly affect terminator observations (Komacek et al. 2022 ).\n.4.1 Ab undance-opacity dec k degeneracy\nur constrained Fe abundance shows a de generac y with the pressure evel of the opacity deck, as shown in Fig. 12 . This shows that higher altitude opacity deck requires a higher abundance in the tmosphere, and arises because the column depth of a given species ncreases to match the observed feature strength when the cloud eck altitude is raised (e.g. B \u0301etr \u0301emieux & Swain 2017 ; Welbanks & adhusudhan 2019 ). Recent work on characterizing atmospheres ith cloud/opacity decks at high resolution (Gandhi, Brogi & Webb 020c ) indicated that abundances of chemical species are still onstrainable even in the presence of high-altitude opacity decks. ur R = 140 000 observations with EPSRESSO confirm this is the ase and we obtain relatively tight constraints for Fe despite our imited spectral co v erage of just \u223c0.4 \u03bcm.\nMNRAS 515, 749\u2013766 (2022)\nM\nFigure 13.

Our retrie v als ndicate a slight preference for the latter, but the constraints are weak ue to its weaker signal compared to the much hotter evening side. e also see no preference for our spatially resolved retrie v al o v er 1D spatially homogeneous retrie v al for the \u03c6 = 0 . 02 \u20130 . 04 range see Table 2 ), indicating that the Fe abundance of the morning may ot be significantly different to that from the evening. .5 Constraints on winds he constraints on the wind parameters from HyDRA-2D are shown n Fig. 13 and the corresponding constraints on the wind speed istributions are plotted in Fig. 14 . In our case, the wind speed is given y V sys as we have shifted the spectra to the rest frame of the planet uring our analysis, and the uncertainty in the known value of V sys s negligible. The V sys values are dependent on the orbital period nd transit time centre, but by propagating the uncertainties reported n Ehrenreich et al. ( 2020 ), we find that V sys changes by at most\n0.5 km s \u22121 . By using other recently published precise orbital values Ivshina & Winn 2022 ; Kokori et al. 2022 ), we also find consistent esults to within the uncertainties and \u223c1 km s \u22121 . Therefore, any edshift or blueshift of the spectrum indicates the presence of a wind nd cannot be explained by variations in orbital parameters.\nFor both phase ranges, we see a strong day-night wind with a ignificant blue shift to the o v erall spectrum, consistent with previous bservations and analyses (Ehrenreich et al. 2020 ; Kesseli & Snellen 021 ). This is a result of the day-night wind that travels toward he observer at the terminator. For the first quarter of the transit we\nNRAS 515, 749\u2013766 (2022)\netrieve a wind speed of \u22125 . 9 + 1 . 5 \u22121 . 1 km s \u22121 , with the negative sign ndicating a blueshift (i.e. a wind travelling from the day-to-night ide). This value is consistent with previously derived wind speeds rom the detection of Na in the upper atmosphere of WASP-76 b Seidel et al. 2021 ). Ho we ver, we constrain a stronger wind speed f \u22129 . 8 + 1 . 2 \u22121 . 1 km s \u22121 for the \u03c6 = 0 . 02 \u20130 . 04 range, but Na is not as trongly detected in this phase range (Kesseli et al. 2022 ) and thus ould explain why the wind speeds are not in as good an agreement.\nAs well as the difference in the wind speeds, we also see a ifference in the \u03b4V wind parameter, which measures the FWHM of he spread in wind speed. We constrain a smaller \u03b4V wind for the ast quarter of the transit, as shown in Fig. 14 . The differences n the parameters during the transit could potentially be due to a ombination of a more dominant day-night wind and a weaker east\u2013 est jet. As the signal from the \u03c6 = 0 . 02 \u20130 . 04 range is dominated y the ev ening side, an y jet present would add to the o v erall profile nd result in a greater blue shift of the signal, resulting in a lower V sys . In addition, the spread in the \u03b4V wind would also be lower as the orning side contributes very little to the overall signal. On the other and, the \u03c6 = \u22120 . 04 to \u2212 0 . 02 range has a significant contribution rom both sides, and may therefore result in a lower o v erall wind peed and greater spread as any contribution from an east\u2013west jet ill be redshifted for the morning. In our constraints we do retrieve wind profile that has a small redshifted contribution for the first uarter of the transit. A day-night wind of \u223c6 km s \u22121 combined with jet of \u223c4 km s \u22121 could thus explain the relative shift in V sys and pread in \u03b4V wind between the first and last quarter of the transit. We ave also carried out retrie v als with an east\u2013west jet instead of a dayight wind and did not see strong evidence for such a case, thus any et present would be weak compared to the day-night wind. This is onsistent with the GCMs from Wardenier et al. ( 2021 ), who showed hat such a weak-drag model best describes the observations.\nOn the other hand, the higher opacity decks constrained for both he morning and evening terminators for the \u03c6 = 0 . 02 \u20130 . 04 range ay also result in such a difference in wind parameters between the rst and last quarter of the transit. If the observations in the latter alf of the transit probe higher altitudes, there may be more of a lue shift in the spectrum as the day-night wind is expected to be ighest at lower pressures. This would also reduce the o v erall spread\nFigure 15. Comparison of HyDRA-2D to general circulation models of WASP-76 b. The highest likelihood model from the retrie v al of the \u03c6 = \u22120 . 04 to \u2212 0 . 02 range was used to generate a transit spectrum as shown in the left-hand panel (in red), and the right-hand panel shows the the corresponding best-fitting model for the \u03c6 = 0 . 02 \u20130 . 04 range. The general circulation model assumes an atmosphere with weak drag, and is calculated through Monte Carlo radiative transfer (see Wardenier et al. 2021 , for further details).\ni H t W d\no t t v a t T r\ne f d 2 t r c\n3\nW m d ( \u2212 \u03c6 \u223c t o c s r i\nm fi\ne p l m a h s b d l a a W F i\na s m o m n r T b T v b d q t T b o a h m\n3\nT c\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m nras/article/515/1/749/6615469 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 18 January 2024\nn the wind speed, \u03b4V wind , as the range in pressures probed reduces. ence it is currently unclear which of these two potential causes of he difference in wind speed is dominant, and further observations of ASP-76 b at high resolution will help to shed light on the various ynamical processes occurring in the atmospheres of UHJs. We note that there is a strong de generac y between K p and V sys in Fig. 13 , as e xpected giv en the limited phase range of the bservations that would act to break this. This de generac y results in he two K p \u2013 V sys distributions for the first and last quarter, which end towards each other at lower K p values. However, the true K p alue is constrained to within \u223c1 km s \u22121 (Ehrenreich et al. 2020 ), nd so we believe the V sys offset between the first and last quarter of he transit is a result of the observations and not uncertainty in the K p . he K p is consistent with expected value of 0 for the \u03c6 = 0 . 02 \u20130 . 04 ange, but the \u03c6 = \u22120 . 04 to \u2212 0 . 02 range does indicate a lower K p , albeit still consistent with 0 at 2 \u03c3 . The deviation from the xpected value is be due to the signal changing its velocity with phase or the first part of the transit, as seen in previous studies with other ata sets and GCMs (e.g. Kesseli & Snellen 2021 ; Wardenier et al. 021 ). This phase dependence is not modelled in our retrie v als due o the complexity of including multi-dimensional phase-dependent adiative transfer into our calculations, and thus results in a slight hange in K p to compensate. .6 Comparison to GCMs e compare the results from HyDRA-2D to general circulation odels of WASP-76 b in Fig. 15 . These show the asymmetric weakrag Monte Carlo radiative transfer model of Wardenier et al. ( 2021 ) see \u2018modification 1\u2019 in their figs 12 and 13) at phases of \u03c6 = 0.031 and 0.031, along with the best-fitting retrie v al model for the = \u22120 . 04 to \u2212 0 . 02 and 0 . 02 \u20130 . 04 range for a small region near 0.366 \u03bcm. For both of the best-fitting models, we have removed he opacity deck as Fe is expected to be the dominant source of pacity in this spectral range, and we do not expect significant cloud ondensation or hazes given the high temperature. We have also mean ubtracted the data sets to remo v e the effect of varying planetary adius and/or reference pressure, as these dependencies are remo v ed n our retrie v al in the high-pass filter as part of the analysis.\nFig. 15 shows that for the first quarter of the transit, the two odels agree well. This is crucial as 3D models have shown better ts to high-resolution observations (Flowers et al. 2019 ; Beltz\nt al. 2021 ), and thus HyDRA-2D is able to capture the rele v ant hysics to fit the dynamics and variability in the observations. The ine positions agree well and have similar strengths between our odel and the GCM, indicating that the constrained wind speeds, bundances and temperatures are in line with expectations. We do o we ver find that our retrieved best-fitting models are somewhat moother than the predictions made from GCMs. This difference is ecause we model an atmosphere with a latitudinally homogeneous ay-night wind contrib ution, b ut the GCM with weak drag includes atitude-dependent effects, depth-dependent wind speeds, as well as temperature structure that varies along the line of sight. These dditional effects result in additional structure to the GCM spectra. e do also see some small differences in the strengths of some of the e lines, but the o v erall agreement between the retrie v al and GCM s encouraging.\nThe latter half of the transit shows that the retrieved features re weaker than the GCM predictions. The GCM indicates that the trength of the Fe signal should increase, but the retrieved best-fitting odel from HyDRA-2D for \u03c6 = 0.031 does not increase in strength v er the \u03c6 = \u22120 . 04 to \u2212 0 . 02 range. A potential factor driving this ay be the temperature profile. The retrie v al constrains temperatures earer \u223c3000 K for the evening side, but the GCM shows some egions of the atmosphere reaching temperatures nearer to \u223c3500 K. his difference results in larger spectral features in the GCM spectra y \u223c15 per cent due to the changing scaleheights of the atmosphere. here will also be an additional and potentially stronger effect of arying line strengths with temperature, and the weaker Fe lines eing further reduced in the retrie v al due to their strong temperature ependence as shown in Fig. 15 . We note that as the retrie v al is a uantitative fit to the data, the GCM may not be completely capturing he true state of the atmosphere and o v erestimating the temperature. his temperature difference between the retrie v al and GCM may e be driven by various effects such as a supersolar Fe abundance, ther optical absorbers as well as disequilibrium chemistry in the tmosphere. Further observations of the transit of WASP-76 b will elp shed more light on these differences and help impro v e our 3D odelling of such hot planets.\n.7 Robustness tests\no verify the robustness of our results we performed numerous hecks with our model.

Such a parameter as often been included in previous high-resolution retrievals (e.g. andhi et al. 2019 ; Gibson et al. 2020 ; Line et al. 2021 ). The cale factor did show some de generac y with the temperature as both ct to increase/decrease the o v erall scaleheight of the atmosphere, ut there were no differences in the retrieved parameters and the v erall relativ e evidences remained similar. We also performed eparate retrie v als on the \u03c6 = 0 . 02 \u20130 . 035 and 0 . 025 \u20130 . 04 range, nd \u03c6 = \u22120 . 035 to \u2212 0 . 02 and \u22120 . 04 to \u2212 0 . 025 ranges. The top ressure that we modelled our atmosphere out to was also varied from 0 \u22127 to 10 \u22128 bar. As well as these tests, we performed retrie v als ith additional free parameters for the radius and log ( g ) of the lanet. None of the retrie v als sho wed any significant difference to ny parameter, and our retrie v als with log ( g ) constrained estimates onsistent with the known values (Ehrenreich et al. 2020 ). We were nable to constrain the planetary radius to any significant degree and hus simply reco v ered the prior given that the high-pass filtering of he data analysis remo v es the radial dependence of the spectrum.\ne also performed retrie v als v arying the number of live points with ultiNest and did not see any significant change in the convergence f any of the parameters. We also performed additional retrie v als parametrizing the temerature profile as an isotherm and with no super-Rayleigh haze rescription, and found no significant changes to our constraints on he photospheric temperature, Fe abundance, opacity deck or wind arameters. The evidences for the isothermal retrievals was also imilar, with the largest difference coming from the HyDRA-2D etrie v al for the first quarter, given that a weak thermal inversion was onstrained for the e vening side. Ho we ver, this was < 2 \u03c3 de viant rom the retrie v als with the fully flexible P \u2013 T profile. These ests indicate that the observations are more sensitive to the o v erall emperature than to the gradients in temperature with height, in line ith expectations for primary eclipse observations. The only change we saw in the retrieved constraints was when we ncluded the very bluest end of the data between 0.38 and 0.4 \u03bcm. For hese tests we retrieved a higher temperature for the atmosphere and a e gativ e v elocity shift in K p . Giv en the v ery strong Fe opacity, these avelengths probe regions of the atmosphere 10 \u22127 bar where nonocal thermodynamic effects are likely to be considerable, and our ssumptions of ideal gas and hydrostatic equilibrium breakdown. ence, it is unsurprising that our retrie v al obtains a lower o v erall vidence for this wav elength re gion. We also varied the wavelength ange we use for the redder end of the observations, with retrievals n the 0.4\u20130.65 and 0.4\u20130.7 \u03bcm range as well as our fiducial 0.4\u2013 .8 \u03bcm. These showed no change in the retrieved constraints for ny parameter, despite some telluric absorption from O 2 and H 2 O t wavelengths 0.7 \u03bcm. This confirms that the spectral cleaning teps were able to ef fecti v ely remo v e the tellurics in this wavelength ange (see Section 2.5 ).\nC O N C L U S I O N S\ne hav e e xplored variations in Fe abundance, temperature profile, nd opacity/haze deck in the atmosphere of the UHJ WASP-76 b hrough a new spatially resolved high-resolution retrieval of the erminator. This was moti v ated by recent analyses on ESPRESSO nd HARPS observations of the primary transit that indicated the resence of an asymmetric signal in Fe during the transit. With ur new retrieval model, HyDRA-2D, we explored the variability nd constrained a day-night wind in the photosphere. We find that\nNRAS 515, 749\u2013766 (2022)\ne has the tightest constraints in the observations on the trailing evening) limb of the last quarter of the transit ( \u03c6 = 0 . 02 \u20130 . 04), with n abundance of log ( X Fe ) = \u22124 . 03 + 0 . 28 \u22120 . 31 . The abundance estimates of e show that the atmosphere is consistent with the stellar metallicity nd the CH 4 /H measurement of Jupiter, as well as with previous onstraints of Fe on the UHJ WASP-121 b (Gibson et al. 2022 ).\nOur HyDRA-2D models are statistically preferred by 4.9 \u03c3 o v er ore traditional spatially homogeneous and combined-phase mod-\nls. The different regions of the atmosphere probed are distinguishble given the high precision and resolution of the observations ade with the ESPRESSO spectrograph. The statistical preference s driven primarily by differences in the temperature and winds, with weaker effect also caused by the chemical abundance differences etween the different regions of the atmosphere. This is consistent ith previous 3D modelling of high-resolution emission spectra in he infrared (Beltz et al. 2021 ). Furthermore, for our separatedhase retrie v als, we find that HyDRA-2D is preferred by 3.6 \u03c3 o v er spatially homogeneous approach for the \u03c6 = \u22120 . 04 to \u2212 0 . 02 ange. Hence, adopting a spatially homogeneous model is likely to iss signals from some regions of the atmosphere, particularly when oth sides have a high signal-to-noise ratio and there is significant symmetry in the physical parameters. On the other hand, we find hat our 1D-retrie v al for the \u03c6 = 0 . 02 \u20130 . 04 range has nearly identical vidence to the spatially resolved HyDRA-2D model, as a result of he evening side dominating o v er the morning side for the latter uarter of the transit. Generally, we observe Fe abundances that are consistent between he different regions of the terminator, but we do find that the Fe bundance is highest where the region of the planet probed is being rradiated, namely the morning side for \u03c6 = \u22120 . 04 to \u2212 0 . 02 and he evening side for \u03c6 = 0 . 02 \u20130 . 04. We also find that our spatially omogeneous retrie v als for the first and last quarter of the transit onverge towards the constraints of the evening side. This suggests hat the evening side is the dominant source of the Fe signal. This emains true for the first quarter of the transit despite the higher onstrained abundance for the morning side, as this higher abundance s offset by the higher altitude opacity deck in the atmosphere, esulting in a weaker o v erall contribution.\nWe do not constrain Fe as significantly on the morning side for he \u03c6 = 0 . 02 \u20130 . 04 range, with the retrieved abundance, log ( X Fe ) =\n4 . 59 + 0 . 85 \u22121 . 0 , having a wider uncertainty than for any other part of the tmosphere. Ehrenreich et al. ( 2020 ) proposed that the Fe signal is ost prominent on the evening, and the lack of significant signal from he morning side may be due to Fe condensing out of the atmosphere. n the other hand, Savel et al. ( 2022 ) proposed that the signal was iminished due to a high-altitude cloud deck. Our retrie v als sho w that ither scenario can fit the observ ations gi ven that there is a degeneracy etween abundance and the opacity deck, with a slight preference for high abundance and opacity/cloud deck. The de generac y is only artial as recent work has shown that abundance constraints from igh-resolution observations are attainable even with high-altitude pacity/cloud decks (Gandhi et al. 2020c ), and we confirm this with bserv ational data. Ho we ver, our Fe uncertainty for the morning for he \u03c6 = 0 . 02 \u20130 . 04 range is much wider than for other regions of the tmosphere because the signal from the evening side dominates the v erall spectrum, as suggested from GCMs (Wardenier et al. 2021 ). Our constraints on the temperature profile indicate an atmosphere hat is between 2950 + 111 \u2212156 K ( \u03c6 = 0 . 02 \u20130 . 04, evening side) and 615 + 266 \u2212275 K ( \u03c6 = 0 . 02 \u20130 . 04, morning side) at 0.1 mbar. We generally nd a temperature that is hottest for the parts of the atmosphere that re irradiated, i.e. the evening side for the last quarter of the transit and he morning side for the first quarter.

We do however see a strong dependence of he temperature on thermal dissociation, a dissociated atmosphere onsisting of H and He was statistically preferred and gave more hysically plausible temperatures o v er an undissociated atmosphere f H 2 and He. This is because an undissociated atmosphere has smaller scaleheight and thus the temperature must substantially ncrease in order to compensate and match the features in the pectrum. Hence we infer the presence of H 2 dissociation in the tmosphere of WASP-76 b, consistent with predictions made for HJs (e.g. Parmentier et al. 2018 ). We constrain a much stronger day-night wind at the end of the ransit at \u22129 . 8 + 1 . 2 \u22121 . 1 km s \u22121 , where the ne gativ e sign denotes that the ind is blueshifted and hence travelling towards the observer at the erminator. For the last quarter of the transit, the signal is dominated y the evening side. On the other hand, the first quarter of the transit ncludes strong contributions from both sides of the atmosphere, nd we find that the wind speed is reduced to \u22125 . 9 + 1 . 5 \u22121 . 1 km s \u22121 . The WHM of the wind speed distribution, \u03b4V wind , is also more spread or the \u03c6 = \u22120 . 04 to \u2212 0 . 02 range at 10 . 2 + 1 . 0 \u22121 . 0 km s \u22121 than for the = 0 . 02 \u20130 . 04 range at 5 . 62 + 0 . 62 \u22120 . 64 km s \u22121 . These constraints could ndicate the presence of a weak equatorial jet in the photosphere, s this would induce a stronger blue shift of the evening side and ombine with the day-night wind to drive the overall wind speed to igher values for the \u03c6 = 0 . 02 \u20130 . 04 range. Ho we ver, the stronger ind speed and lower \u03b4V wind could also be a result of the higher ltitudes probed in this phase range, given that the day-night wind is xpected to be stronger at higher altitudes (e.g. Wardenier et al. 2021 ).\nThis work is a significant step into multi-dimensional spatially esolved retrie v al analyses of exoplanetary atmospheres. K ey to these etrie v als is incorporating the 3D dynamical processes of GCMs ith the flexibility and computational efficiency required to explore illions of models o v er a wide ranging parameter space. Potential uture work could make the wind profiles more realistic with more omplex physics (e.g. Seidel et al. 2020 ), or implement a varying emperature profile along the line of sight for each side of the tmosphere (Dobbs-Dixon & Blecic 2022 ; Nixon & Madhusudhan 022 ), more akin to the thermal profiles from GCMs. Another otential impro v ement may be to use the likelihood method of Gibson t al. ( 2020 ). Such models are also ideally suited to simultaneous nalyses combining high- and lo w-resolution observ ations (Gandhi t al. 2019 ), and will play a key role as we begin characterizing xoplanets with the next generation of facilities.\nC K N OW L E D G E M E N T S\nG is grateful to Leiden Observatory at Leiden University for the ward of the Oort Fellowship.
