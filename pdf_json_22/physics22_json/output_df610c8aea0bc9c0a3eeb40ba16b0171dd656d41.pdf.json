In the present work, we focus on the exclusive photoproduction of a \u03b3\u03c0\u00b1 pair with a large invariant mass which provides the hard scale for justifying QCD collinear factorisation,\n\u03b3(q, q) +N(p1, \u03bb1) \u2212\u2192 \u03b3(k, k) +N \u2032(p2, \u03bb2) + \u03c0\u00b1(p\u03c0) . (1.1)\nIn this way, one is able to probe the leading twist chiral even quark GPDs. The work presented here builds up on our previous publication [15] in the following aspects:\n\u2022 the kinematics is extended from JLab to COMPASS, EIC and LHC (in ultraperipheral collisions),\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 2 4 1\nTH\nm\u2032\n\u03c6 \u03c6\nm\nt\u2032\nM2\u03b3m\n\u03c6\nt\u2032\nx+ \u03be x\u2212 \u03be\nt\nN N \u2032 GPD\nTH\n\u03c0\nM2\u03b3\u03c0\nFigure 1. Left: factorisation of the amplitude for the process \u03b3 +m\u2032 \u2192 \u03b3 +m at large s and fixed angle (i.e. fixed ratio t\u2032/s). Right: replacing the incoming meson distribution amplitude by a nucleon generalised parton distribution leads to the factorisation of the amplitude for \u03b3 +N \u2192 \u03b3 + \u03c0 +N \u2032 at large M2\u03b3\u03c0 and small t.\n\u2022 results for a new distribution amplitude (DA), the so-called \u2018holographic\u2019 model are worked out and presented,\n\u2022 in addition to the unpolarised cross-sections, linear polarisation asymmetries are computed.\nOriginally, the motivation for using QCD collinear factorisation for the process we consider was obtained by making a comparison with the photon meson scattering process, \u03b3 +m\u2032 \u2192 \u03b3 +m, at large s and fixed angle (i.e. fixed ratio t\u2032/s), see figure 1. By replacing the incoming meson distribution amplitude with the generalised parton distribution of the nucleon, one can infer that in order to benefit from the factorisation properties of the former process, the invariant mass of the photon-meson pair, M\u03b3\u03c0, should be large, while t = (pN \u2212 pN \u2032)2 should be small. Recently, QCD collinear factorisation has been proven in a very similar process, the exclusive production of a photon pair in pion-nucleon collisions [16, 17]. The proof relies on the transverse momentum of each photon in the final state to be large. We note that such a proof of factorisation at leading twist is applicable for the family of exclusive 2\u2192 3 processes, and in particular for our process as well. We point out that a recent 1-loop computation for the similar process of exclusive photoproduction of a photon pair [18, 19] shows indeed that collinear QCD holds at the NLO level. For the process under consideration, the invariant mass of the photon-meson pair M2\u03b3\u03c0 is taken to be large. However, even though the invariant mass of the pair is large, the outgoing pion could in principle have a low transverse momentum with respect to the scattered nucleon. This would then allow for soft gluon interactions between the partons of the produced low pT pion and the partons of the colliding and scattered nucleon, which could destroy the collinear factorization formalism. In practice, we avoid this by imposing\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 2 4 1\nkinematical cuts on various Mandelstam invariants, which forces the invariant mass of the scattered nucleon and the outgoing pion to be above the resonance region. The paper is organised as follows: in section 2, we discuss the kinematics of our process. Then, in section 3, we present the non-perturbative inputs to our calculation, namely the GPDs and the DAs. The decomposition of the amplitude in terms of tensorial structures and basic building block integrals, as well as the calculation of the fully-differential cross-section, are the subject of section 4. Our results, for the fully-differential, single-differential and integrated cross-sections and linear polarisation asymmetry with respect to the incoming photon are shown in section 5. Both cross-sections and linear polarisation asymmetries are shown, for JLab, COMPASS, EIC and ultraperipheral collisions (UPCs) at LHC kinematics. This section finishes with an estimation of counting rates at various experiments in order to assess the feasibility of measuring our process. We end with conclusions in section 6. Expressions for the exact kinematics are given in appendix A. A detailed study of the influence of kinematical cuts on the invariant masses in different sub-channels to avoid the resonance region, as well as on the cross-section estimates is shown in appendix B. In appendix C, the new building block integrals involving the holographic DA are presented, and relevant diagrams are expressed in terms of these building block integrals. Details regarding the determination of the photon flux are found in appendix D. The phase space integration is briefly discussed in appendix E. Finally, in appendix F, the linear polarisation asymmetry is discussed, and their expressions are explicitly given."

In the above, \u03bb1 and \u03bb2 are the light-cone helicities of the nucleons with momenta p1 and p2. In our analysis, the contributions from Eq and E\u0303q are neglected, since they are suppressed by kinematical factors at the cross-section level, see (4.34). The GPDs are parametrised in terms of double distributions [22]. The details can be found in [15, 20], and we do not repeat them here. The t-dependence of the GPDs is modelled by a simplistic dipole ansatz, discussed in appendix E. We note that in the current leading order in \u03b1s study, we neglect any evolution of the GPDs/PDFs, and take a fixed factorisation scale of \u00b52F = 10GeV2.

We denote (AB)123 the contribution of the sum of diagrams A1 +A2 +A3 +B1 +B2 +B3, and (AB)45 the contribution of the sum of diagrams A4 +A5 +B4 +B5, and similarly for (CD)12 and (CD)345. They are separately QED gauge invariant. Indeed, the colour factor factorises, and the discussion reduces to a pure QED one. In the block (AB)123, the three bosons are connected to a single quark line in all possible ways. In the block (AB)45, a photon and a gluon are connected to each quark line in all possible ways. The same reasoning applies to (CD)12 and (CD)345 after exchanging the role of the initial and final state photons. Using the notation eq = Qq|e|, by QED gauge invariance, one can write any amplitude for photon meson production as the sum of three separate gauge invariant terms, in the form\nM = (Q21 +Q22)Msum + (Q21 \u2212Q22)Mdiff + 2Q1Q2Mprod , (4.2)\nwhere Q1 is the charge of the quark entering the DA and Q2 is the charge of the quark leaving the DA, in each diagram. Considering the parity properties of the qq\u0304 correlators appearing in the DA and in the GPDs, we separate the contributions for parity (+), denoted as S and parity (\u2212), denoted as P . Only two structures occur in the hard part, namely PP (two \u03b35 matrices) and SP (one \u03b35). A close inspection of the C-parity transformation which relates the two sets of 10 diagrams gives the following results. In the present case, for the vector contribution, the sum of diagrams reads\nMV\u03c0 (4.3) =Q21[(AB)123]SP\u2297f+Q1Q2[(AB)45]SP\u2297f\u2212Q22[(AB)123] (C) SP \u2297f\u2212Q1Q2[(AB)45] (C) SP \u2297f ,\nwhile for the axial contribution one gets\nMA\u03c0 (4.4) =Q21[(AB)123]PP\u2297f\u0303+Q1Q2[(AB)45]PP\u2297f\u0303+Q22[(AB)123] (C) PP\u2297f\u0303+Q1Q2[(AB)45] (C) PP\u2297f\u0303 .\n\u2013 7 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 2 4 1\nHere, f denotes a GPD of the set H,E appearing in the decomposition of the vector correlator (3.2), while f\u0303 denotes a GPD of the set H\u0303, E\u0303 appearing in the decomposition of the axial correlator (3.3). The symbol \u2297 represents the integration over x. The integration over z for the pion DA is implicit, since the DA is symmetric over z \u2194 1\u2212 z. The above decomposition is convenient since the integration over z is performed analytically, while the integration over x is performed numerically. This allows us to evaluate the amplitude in blocks which can be used for computing various observables. Equations (4.3) and (4.4) are obtained by making the identification\n[(CD)345]SP = \u2212 [(AB)123] (C) SP , (4.5)\n[(CD)12]SP = \u2212 [(AB)45] (C) SP , (4.6)\n[(CD)345]PP = [(AB)123] (C) PP , (4.7)\n[(CD)12]PP = [(AB)45] (C) PP . (4.8)\nWe introduce a few convenient notations. A superscript s (resp. a) refers to the symmetric (resp. antisymmetric) structures of the hard amplitude and of the GPD w.r.t. x, i.e.\nf(x) = 12(f(x) + f(\u2212x)) + 1 2(f(x)\u2212 f(\u2212x)) = f s(x) + fa(x) . (4.9)\nThis thus leads to\nMV\u03c0 = (Q21 +Q22) [(AB)123]aSP \u2297 fa + (Q21 \u2212Q22) [(AB)123]sSP \u2297 f s\n+ 2Q1Q2 [(AB)45]aSP \u2297 fa , (4.10)\nand for the axial GPD contribution, i.e. PP :\nMA\u03c0 = (Q21 +Q22) [(AB)123]sPP \u2297 f\u0303 s + (Q21 \u2212Q22) [(AB)123]aPP \u2297 f\u0303a\n+ 2Q1Q2 [(AB)45]sPP \u2297 f\u0303 s , (4.11)\nwith Q1 = Qu and Q2 = Qd for a \u03c0+, and Q1 = Qd and Q2 = Qu for a \u03c0\u2212. In the case of \u03c10 meson production [20], which is C(\u2212), the exchange in the t-channel is fixed to be C(\u2212), while for the \u03c00 meson, which is C(+), the exchange in the t-channel is fixed to be C(+). On the other hand, \u03c0+ production (and similarly for \u03c0\u2212) involves both C-parity exchanges in t-channel, which explains why both symmetrical and antisymmetrical parts of the GPDs are involved in equations (4.10) and (4.11). The detailed evaluation of one diagram was already illustrated in [15], and therefore, we do not repeat it here."

More details on the importance sampling procedure can be found in section 5.2.1.\nTo obtain the amplitude tables in (\u2212u\u2032) for each of value of M2\u03b3\u03c0,\n\u2022 we calculate, for each of the above types of GPDs (in the present paper H and H\u0303), sets of u and d quarks GPDs indexed by M2\u03b3\u03c0, i.e. ultimately by \u03be given by\n\u03be = M2\u03b3\u03c0\n2(S\u03b3N \u2212M2)\u2212M2\u03b3\u03c0 . (5.1)\nThe GPDs are computed as tables of 1000 values for x ranging from \u22121 to 1, unless importance sampling is needed, in which case 1000 more values around the peak is added, see section 5.2.1.\n\u2022 we compute the building block integrals which do not depend on \u2212u\u2032. In the asymptotic DA case, this corresponds to Ie (see appendix D in [15] for the notation), while in the holographic DA case, this corresponds to both Ie and \u03c7c, see appendix C.\n\u2022 we choose 100 values of (\u2212u\u2032), linearly varying from (\u2212u\u2032)min = 1 GeV2 up to its maximum possible value (\u2212u\u2032)maxMax (see appendix E in [15] for how this is computed). Again, if importance sampling is needed (when the cross-section varies rapidly at the boundaries), an extra set of 100 values of (\u2212u\u2032) is added at each boundary.\n\u2022 at each value of (\u2212u\u2032), we compute, for each GPD and each flavour u and d, the remaining building block integrals, which are Ib, Ic, Ih, Ii in the asymptotic DA case, and only \u03c7b in the holographic DA case.\n\u2022 this gives, for each of these couples of values of (M2\u03b3\u03c0,\u2212u\u2032) and each flavour, a set of 12 coefficients listed in equation (4.33).\n\u2022 one can then get the desired cross-sections using equations (4.39) and (4.40).\nTo obtain corresponding tables at other lower values of S\u03b3N , which is needed to span the whole phase space, we use a mapping procedure, which we describe below, from the appropriate set of tables. First, note that the building block integrals only depend on \u03b1, \u03be and on the GPDs (which are computed as grids indexed by \u03be). The crucial point to observe is that since \u03b1 = \u2212u\u2032/M2\u03b3\u03c0 , it is possible to use exactly the set of already computed amplitudes, provided one selects the same set of (\u03b1, \u03be). Second, one should note that a given value of \u03be corresponds to an infinite set of couples of values (M2\u03b3\u03c0, S\u03b3N ), see (5.1).\n\u2013 13 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 2 4 1\nOn the other hand, in practice, we index our amplitude tables by M2\u03b3\u03c0 and \u2212u\u2032. Thus, by choosing a new value of S\u0303\u03b3N , we obtain a new set of values of M\u03032\u03b3\u03c0 indexed by the original set of values of M2\u03b3\u03c0, through the relation\nM\u03032\u03b3\u03c0 = M2\u03b3\u03c0 S\u0303\u03b3N \u2212M2\nS\u03b3N \u2212M2 , (5.2)\nwhich is deduced from eq. (5.1). For each of these M\u03032\u03b3\u03c0, a set of values of \u2212u\u0303\u2032 , is obtained using the relation\n\u2212 u\u0303\u2032 = M\u03032\u03b3\u03c0 M2\u03b3\u03c0 (\u2212u\u2032) , (5.3)\nwhich gives the indexation of allowed values of \u2212u\u0303\u2032 as function of known values of (\u2212u\u2032). It is easy to check that this mapping procedure from a given S\u03b3N to a lower S\u0303\u03b3N provides a set of (M\u03032\u03b3\u03c0,\u2212u\u0303\u2032) which exhaust the required domain. This has been shown explicitly in [20] already, and we do not reproduce this here. Thus, from a single set of computation at a fixed S\u03b3N , one can obtain the complete dependence of amplitudes and thus of cross-sections for the whole range of S\u0303\u03b3N < S\u03b3N . This allows for a significant decrease in computing time, from the order of months to a few days."

            "text": "Unfortunately, extending the kinematical range from previous papers [15, 20] is not as simple as merely changing the maximum S\u03b3N . This is due to the fact that when S\u03b3N increases, the GPDs and cross-sections vary more rapidly over a smaller range of the variable x for GPDs, and (\u2212u\u2032) and M2\u03b3\u03c0 for cross-sections. To get around this problem, tables had to be generated using importance sampling. This needed to be implemented at 3 different levels:\n\u2022 The GPDs can vary rapidly as a function of x in a range of a few \u03be from x = 0. As S\u03b3N increases up to 20000GeV2, \u03be can become as small as 7.5\u00d7 10\u22126.\n\u2022 The fully differential cross-section rises very sharply at the endpoints in (\u2212u\u2032) as the parameters \u03b1 or \u03b1\u0304 (see (2.16)) become smaller.\n\u2022 The single differential cross-section always has a peak at low values of M2\u03b3\u03c0 (roughly 2\u20134GeV2) as S\u03b3N increases. The origin of this feature is explained in section 5.3.2.\nTherefore, care needs to be taken during the generation of tables to ensure that there are sufficient data points to cover all the above-mentioned cases. This task is further complicated by the fact that the datasets are generated at fixed S\u03b3N , which are then mapped to lower values of S\u03b3N , as described before. One needs to ensure that the three regions described above still remain adequately covered after the mapping. For the 7 sets of amplitude tables computed for this work, we are able to cover all such regions adequately for the whole phase space for S\u03b3N \u2264 20000GeV2.

            "text": "In this section, we will show the results for the polarisation asymmetries of the incoming photon beam, in the JLab kinematics. As discussed in appendix F, the circular polarisation asymmetry vanishes as a result of conservation of parity P for an unpolarised target, which is the case we consider here.9 Therefore, we compute the linear polarisation asymmetries (LPAs) w.r.t. the incoming photon. The basic formula for constructing the asymmetry is\nLPA = \u222b d\u03c3x \u2212 \u222b d\u03c3y\u222b\nd\u03c3x + \u222b d\u03c3y , (5.4)\n9The circular double spin asymmetry does not vanish and may be an interesting observable for a polarised target experiment.\n\u2013 18 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 2 4 1\nwhere d\u03c3x(y) corresponds to the differential cross-section with the incoming photon linearly polarised along the x(y)-direction. The integral symbol in eq. (5.4) corresponds to phase space integration \u2014 The LPA can thus be calculated at the fully differential (by dropping the integral altogether), single differential or integrated levels.\nIn the first step, we choose the x-direction to be along p\u22a5, i.e.\n\u03b5\u00b5x \u2261 p\u00b5\u22a5 |~pt| , (5.5)\nand the y-direction orthogonal to the x-direction, i.e.\n\u03b5\u00b5y \u2261 \u2212 2\ns|~pt| pnp\u22a5\u00b5 . (5.6)\nIn other words, the direction of the x-axis is taken to be (almost) aligned to the direction of the outgoing photon in the transverse plane (since |~pt| |~\u2206t|), see (2.8). However, in an experiment, the polarisation of the colliding photon is experimentally fixed and measured w.r.t. to a given axis. Therefore, the definition of the LPA using (5.5) and (5.6) does not correspond to a direct experimental observable, since the x-direction changes on an event-by event basis. Therefore, it is more convenient to define new polarisation vectors, given by(\n\u03b5\u0304\u00b5x \u03b5\u0304\u00b5y\n) = (\ncos \u03b8 \u2212 sin \u03b8 sin \u03b8 cos \u03b8 )( \u03b5\u00b5x \u03b5\u00b5y ) , (5.7)\nwhere \u03b8 is the angle between p\u00b5\u22a5 and the x-direction as measured in the lab frame. One can show that the LPA in the lab frame, LPALab, is equivalent to LPAmax defined using (5.4) to (5.6), with a modulation of cos 2\u03b8,\nLPALab = LPAmax cos 2\u03b8 . (5.8)\nTherefore, the results for the LPA in this paper are shown for LPAmax, i.e. in terms of the \u2018theoretically convenient\u2019 basis of polarisation vectors, \u03b5x and \u03b5y. More details regarding the relevant expressions and their derivations can be found in appendix F. First, we show the effect of different M2\u03b3\u03c0 on the LPAs at the fully differential level (i.e. differential in (\u2212u\u2032), M2\u03b3\u03c0 and (\u2212t) as in section 5.3.1) in figure 8. As in figure 3, the values of M2\u03b3\u03c0 used are 3, 4 and 5GeV2. One thus finds that the process is dominated by incoming linearly polarised photons along the y-direction, since the LPA is in general negative. Another interesting feature of the LPAs is that they are very good for distinguishing between the standard and valence scenarios for the axial GPDs, but they are relatively insensitive to the DA model being used. This is in contrast to the cross-sections themselves, for which changing the GPD model only leads to moderate differences in the values of the cross-sections. Next, we show how the relative contributions from the vector and axial GPDs affect the LPA at the fully differential level in figure 9. Thus, we find that the axial contribution to the LPA (in green) changes dramatically depending on the axial GPD model used (standard vs valence scenarios), and it still leaves an imprint in the total contribution (in black).

Note that the vector contributions consist of only two curves in each case, since they are insensitive to either valence or standard scenarios.\nvalence scenario, the contribution to the cross-section from the axial GPDs is very small, see figure 4. Thus, even though the axial contribution has a very different LPA from the vector contribution, the total LPA remains closer to the one from the vector contribution only. The relative contributions from the u quark GPDs (Hu and H\u0303u) and d quark GPDs (Hd and H\u0303d) to the LPA are shown in figure 10. Next, we show the LPA, at the single differential level, for different values of S\u03b3N in figure 11. As for the cross-section plots in section 5.3.2, the values of S\u03b3N used are 8, 14 and 20GeV2. We note that the type of DA used has a very small effect on the LPA. On the other hand, the models used for the axial GPDs (valence or standard) changes the shape of the curves altogether, for both \u03c0+ and \u03c0\u2212 mesons. This gives hope that the LPA for \u03c0+ and \u03c0\u2212 can be used for distinguishing between the 2 GPD models that we consider here.\n\u2013 20 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 2 4 1\n1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5\n-1.0\n-0.8\n-0.6\n-0.4\n-0.2\n0.0\n\u2212u\u2032(GeV2) LPAmax\n1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5\n-1.0\n-0.8\n-0.6\n-0.4\n-0.2\n0.0\n\u2212u\u2032(GeV2)LPAmax\nFigure 10.

The dashed (non-dashed) lines correspond to holographic (asymptotic) DA, while the dotted (non-dotted) lines correspond to the standard (valence) scenario. The same colour and line style conventions as in figure 6 are used here.\nFinally, we show the LPA, integrated over all differential variables, as a function of S\u03b3N in figure 12. In both the \u03c0+ and \u03c0\u2212 cases, the choice of the model for the axial GPDs (standard or valence) has a significant effect on the LPA. Moreover, in the \u03c0+ case with the standard scenario, the choice of DA has almost no effect on the LPA, while for the valence scenario, the effect of the choice of DA has a mild effect. This is the opposite of what happens in the \u03c0\u2212 case, where it is for the valence scenario that the choice of DA has almost no effect.\nIn both cases, the LPA is sizeable, and goes up to 60% in the case of \u03c0\u2212. This, combined with the expected counting rates found in section 5.6.1, makes the measurement of such an observable very promising. Imposing a more strict kinematical cut of (\u2212t\u2032) > 1.7GeV2 to avoid the \u03c0N \u2032 resonance region completely, amplifies the LPA.

Since we consider the large angle scattering kinematics, which amounts to large (\u2212u\u2032) and M2\u03b3\u03c0, and small (\u2212t), we are able to employ the collinear factorization. In fact, QCD factorisation has been recently proven to hold for a family of 2\u2192 3 exclusive processes [16, 17], which includes our process, for large |~pt|2, which is parametrically equivalent to large M2\u03b3\u03c0. Furthermore, the various kinematical cuts that we employ ensure that the \u03c0N \u2032 invariant mass almost never reaches the resonance region, which would spoil collinear factorisation. Our results show that the exclusive photoproduction of a \u03b3\u03c0\u00b1 pair with a large invariant mass provides another interesting channel to study GPDs, besides the extensively studied channels such as DVCS, DVMP and TCS. The counting rates at various experiments have been estimated in section 5.6, and the values look promising, especially at JLab where they were estimated to be of the order of 105. In fact, the GPD model corresponding to the standard scenario, which is favoured by lattice results [33], as well as its recent update in [34], gives larger cross-sections. Furthermore, we found that the linear polarisation asymmetries w.r.t. the incoming photon are significant, and become even larger at higher centre of mass energies. In particular, this is almost maximal in the case of the \u03c0\u2212. Moreover, by exploiting the high energies available at EIC and UPCs at LHC, one is able to probe GPDs in the region of small skewness \u03be, a region where very little is known about GPDs. We found that imposing kinematical cuts to the region of small \u03be \u2264 5\u00d7 10\u22123 the counting rates drop by roughly a factor of 10, which still leaves sufficient statistics. We would like to point out to the reader that the code which we used to produce the results in this paper is able to generate tables of cross-sections for any kinematics. Tables of (un)polarised cross-sections can be provided by the authors on request. Phenomenologically, it is known that in \u03c00 electroproduction, higher twist-3 pion DA contributions are important at moderate energies. Indeed, the chiral nature of the \u03c0 meson leads to an anomalously large twist 3 chiral-odd DA and this component has been advocated to be the source of the large transverse amplitude for \u03c0 meson electroproduction measured at JLab [35, 36] (let us remind the reader that the leading twist-2 factorization proof of DVMP applies only to the amplitude with longitudinally polarised photon). However, when naively calculated, one is faced with end-point singularities [37]. We refer to [38, 39] for a possible treatment of such issues. We would like to emphasise that for our process, which involves photoproduction, it is unclear whether such contributions would be important. This could be resolved by comparing our results, which are based on leading twist-2 DA, with experimental data. Nevertheless, it would be interesting to estimate the contribution of twist-3 pion DAs in our process.\n\u2013 35 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 2 4 1\nLike was performed for the case of diphoton photoproduction in [18], we intend to perform the computation at NLO in \u03b1s, in the spirit of [40, 41]. While QCD collinear factorisation was proved for our process, it is nevertheless desirable to determine the finite radiative NLO corrections after explicitly performing the cancellation of UV/IR divergences. The knowledge of such corrections, which are often significant for phenomenology, will increase the precision of our predictions and will give us the opportunity to estimate the uncertainties related to our process based on the collinear factorisation approach. We will also extend our analysis to a final state neutral pion. While the structure of the code allows this extension to be performed with minimal effort for quark GPDs, the quantum numbers of the \u03c00 meson, in particular its positive C-parity, allow contributions from gluon GPDs.11 Such gluonic contributions, with the pomeron quantum numbers, would eventually dominate at small x."

We begin by considering the case of ~\u2206t = 0 with explicit formulae, since in this limit, we expect the largest cross-section, and moreover, the kinematics of the process simplifies significantly. We then also discuss the case of non-zero ~\u2206t, where we perform the analysis through computational techniques as it is more involved. We end this appendix by investigating the effects of having more strict cuts on the cross-section, which ensure that the invariant mass M2\u03c0N \u2032 is always outside the resonance region.\nB.1 The case of ~\u2206t = 0\nWhen ~\u2206t = 0, one finds that\nM2\u03b3\u03c0 = 2\u03be s ( 1\u2212 2 \u03be M 2\ns(1\u2212 \u03be2)\n) , (B.1)\n\u2212t\u2032 = ~p 2 t\n\u03b1 , (B.2)\n\u2212u\u2032 = ~p 2 t + (1\u2212 \u03b1\u03c0)M2\u03c0\n\u03b1\u03c0 , (B.3)\n\u2212t = 4\u03be 2M2\n1\u2212 \u03be2 , (B.4)\nM2\u03c0N \u2032 = s (\n1\u2212 \u03be + ~p 2 t +M2\u03c0 s \u03b1\u03c0\n)( \u03b1\u03c0 +\nM2\ns (1\u2212 \u03be)\n) \u2212 ~p 2t , (B.5)\nand the relations between the kinematical parameters become\n2 \u03be = ~p 2 t\ns \u03b1 + ~p 2 t +M2\u03c0 s \u03b1\u03c0 , 1\u2212 \u03b1\u2212 \u03b1\u03c0 = 2 \u03be M2 s (1\u2212 \u03be2) .

Effectively, this corresponds to a change of variables from (s, \u03be, \u03b1) to ( S\u03b3N , M 2 \u03b3\u03c0, (\u2212u\u2032) ) .

(B.11)\nA careful numerical analysis of the above function, taking into account the various kinematical cuts, shows that the minimum value of M2\u03c0N \u2032 occurs when S\u03b3N is smallest, and M2\u03b3\u03c0 and (\u2212u\u2032) are largest. This corresponds to S\u03b3N = 4.75GeV2, M2\u03b3\u03c0 = 1.52GeV2 and (\u2212u\u2032) = 1GeV2, see appendix E, and leads to12(\nM2\u03c0N \u2032 )\nmin = 2.09GeV2 , (B.12)\nwhich is well outside the resonance region, m2\u2206 \u2248 1.52GeV2.\nB.2 The case of ~\u2206t 6= 0\nThe situation is more subtle when ~\u2206t 6= 0, since there are 2 more independent kinematical variables, which one can represent as |~\u2206t| and ~\u2206t \u00b7 ~pt. Since the equations are extremely involved in this case, we performed a pure numerical analysis to obtain the minimum value of the invariant mass M2\u03c0N \u2032 , using the kinematical cuts given in (2.14) that we apply for our process. We thus find that(\nM2\u03c0N \u2032 )\nmin = 1.42GeV2 , (B.13)\n12A similar conclusion was reached in [20] for the \u03c1 meson, see the discussion at the end of appendix D.1 in that paper.\n\u2013 38 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 2 4 1\nfor example, at\nS\u03b3N = 39.2GeV2 , M2\u03b3\u03c0 = 8.81GeV2 , ( \u2212u\u2032 ) = 8.29GeV2 , |~\u2206t| = 0.571GeV ,\n(B.14)\nwith ~pt and ~\u2206t back-to-back. We find that ( M2\u03c0N \u2032 ) min is insensitive to the value of S\u03b3N , but on the other hand, the minimal value occurs only when ~pt and ~\u2206t are back-to-back, and when (\u2212u\u2032) reaches its maximal value (\u2212u\u2032)maxMax (see appendix E.1 in [15]),\n(\u2212u\u2032)maxMax = (\u2212t)max \u2212M2\u03c0 +M2\u03b3\u03c0 \u2212 (\u2212t\u2032)min . (B.15)\nBy employing more strict cuts, i.e. increasing (\u2212t\u2032)min and (\u2212u\u2032)min or decreasing (\u2212t)max, one can increase ( M2\u03c0N \u2032 ) min. In particular, using (\u2212t\u2032)min = 1.7GeV\n2, we find that( M2\u03c0N \u2032 ) min = 2.04GeV2 , (B.16)\nwhich is well outside the resonance region. Hence, in the next subsection, we present results for the cross-sections and linear polarisation asymmetries in the JLab kinematics for a kinematical cut of (\u2212t\u2032) > 1.7GeV2. However, this cut is very conservative, in the sense that it eliminates a significant part of the phase space. M2\u03c0N \u2032 falls in the problematic region in a restricted range of \u03d5, where \u03d5 is the angle between ~pt and ~\u2206t. In fact, minimising M2\u03c0N \u2032 over all kinematical variables except \u03d5 indicates that for any cos\u03d5 > \u22120.7, M2\u03c0N \u2032 is always above 2GeV2. We stress that the bound on cos\u03d5 is obtained for the value of |~\u2206t| that minimises M\u03c0N \u2032 , which corresponds to the absolute worse-case scenario. On the other hand, in our analysis, \u03d5 has already been integrated out since the cross-section is isotropic after setting |~\u2206t| = 0, which we perform in the hard part of the amplitude. Therefore, more than 3/4 of the phase space that is eliminated by increasing the kinematical cut from (\u2212t\u2032) > 1GeV2 to (\u2212t\u2032) > 1.7GeV2 should in principle be kept, since M2\u03c0N \u2032 is well-outside the resonance region in these parts of the phase space.\nB.3 Effects on the cross-sections and linear polarisation asymmetries\nHere, we reproduce some of the plots from section 5 with a cut of (\u2212t\u2032) = 1.7GeV2, instead of (\u2212t\u2032) = 1GeV2. We choose to present only the corresponding plots for JLab kinematics, as we find them to be the most informative. Figure 33 shows the fully-differential cross-section as a function of (\u2212u\u2032) for different value of M2\u03b3\u03c0 at S\u03b3N = 20GeV2. This is the analogue of figure 3 in section 5. Increasing (\u2212t\u2032)min by xGeV2 corresponds to cutting off xGeV2 from the upper boundary of (\u2212u\u2032), from (B.15). Therefore, figure 33 is equivalent to figure 3, with the upper boundary of (\u2212u\u2032) cut by 0.7GeV2. Figure 34 shows the single differential cross-section as a function of M2\u03b3\u03c0 for different values of S\u03b3N . This figure is the analogue of figure 6 in section 5.3.2 where a kinematical cut of (\u2212t\u2032) > 1GeV2 was used. The minimum value of M2\u03b3\u03c0 in figure 34 is increased by 0.7GeV2 w.r.t. figure 6, and this can be seen from (A.7). Moreover, the height of the peaks decreases by a factor of 3.5 for S\u03b3N = 8GeV2, down to 2.5 for S\u03b3N = 20GeV2 for the\n\u2013 39 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 2 4 1\n1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 0\n5\n10\n15\n\u2212u\u2032(GeV2)\nd\u03c3\u03b3\u03c0+\ndM2\u03b3\u03c0+d(\u2212u\u2032)d(\u2212t) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 (\u2212t)min (pb \u00b7GeV\u22126)\n1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 3.0 3.5 0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\n\u2212u\u2032(GeV2)\nd\u03c3\u03b3\u03c0\u2212\ndM2\u03b3\u03c0\u2212d(\u2212u\u2032)d(\u2212t) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 (\u2212t)min (pb \u00b7GeV\u22126)\nFigure 33.

The decrease of this factor with S\u03b3N is due to the simple fact that the volume of the phase space increases with S\u03b3N , while the increase of the cut on (\u2212t\u2032) eliminates a fixed volume of phase space. Thus, the relative effect of the cut decreases as S\u03b3N increases. We also note that the cross-section is quite large in the region of phase space that is eliminated by increasing the (\u2212t\u2032) cut, which implies that the peak height in figure 34 is sizeably reduced. Finally, we find that for the \u03c0\u2212 case, the valence scenario is more suppressed. The variation of the integrated cross-section with S\u03b3N is shown in figure 35. As in the previous figure, the minimum value of S\u03b3N increases. The cross-section increases more slowly in figure 35w.r.t. its analogue in figure 7.

As already noted above, the valence scenario is more affected by this cut in the \u03c0\u2212 case. The variation of the LPA (as defined in (5.4)) with (\u2212u\u2032) for different values of M2\u03b3\u03c0 is shown in figure 36, where the more strict kinematical cut of (\u2212t\u2032) > 1.7GeV2 was imposed.

An inspection of figure 36 indicates that the new kinematical cut on (\u2212t\u2032) eliminates the region close to the upper boundary of (\u2212u\u2032), where the LPA is close to zero. Thus, the \u2018weight\u2019 of the contribution to the LPA at small values of (\u2212u\u2032) becomes more important, and upon integration, one obtains an LPA that is more negative. We note that a similar effect is also observed for COMPASS, EIC and UPC at LHC kinematics.\nThe variation of the LPA at the integrated level is shown in figure 38 as a function of S\u03b3N . Just as in figure 37, the LPA is amplified when the minimal value of (\u2212t\u2032) is increased from 1GeV2 to 1.7GeV2. This effect is also observed for COMPASS, EIC and UPC at LHC kinematics. In fact, this feature can be exploited experimentally; however, it should be noted that this comes at the cost of having lower statistics.\nFinally, we conclude this appendix by showing the effect on the counting rates. For JLab, one finds that the expected number of events decreases by a factor of 3 roughly, see table 5. However, as stressed below (B.16), a significant portion of the events that\n\u2013 42 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 2 4 1\nhave been cut out, should in fact be kept, since they do not correspond to M2\u03c0N \u2032 in the problematic resonance region."

            "text": "In this appendix, we show the explicit results for the amplitudes in terms of building block integrals. In particular, we discuss only the holographic DA case, since all the relevant results for the asymptotic DA case can be found in appendix D of [15].\nC.1 Integration over z\nWe consider the holographic DA\n\u03c6hol(z) = 8 \u03c0\n\u221a z(1\u2212 z) , (C.1)\nwhich normalises to 1 1\u222b\n0\n\u03c6hol(z) = 1 , (C.2)\nas seen immediately after using the change of variable z = cos2 t. To compute the contribution of the different Feynman diagrams convoluted to the DA, we will need to compute a set of integrals.\nThe simplest one is 1\u222b\n0\n\u03c6hol(z) zz\u0304 dz = 8 , (C.3)\nanalogous to the asymptotic DA case 1\u222b\n0\n\u03c6as(z) zz\u0304 dz = 6 , (C.4)\nwhich allows us to compute diagrams A1, A2, A3, B1, B2, B3. In particular, this means that for these diagrams, the same building block integrals as the asymptotic DA case can be used, provided the overall prefactor is changed from 6 to 8. In practice, what is done is that the prefactor is added a posteriori \u2014 When generating the tables, there is no prefactor. We now consider the diagrams A4,5 and B4,5 which are more involved. First, let us consider the vector structure. Denoting\nA = 2\u03be + (1\u2212 \u03b1)(x\u2212 \u03be + i\u03b5) , (C.5) B = \u03b1(x\u2212 \u03be + i\u03b5) , (C.6)\n\u2013 43 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 2 4 1\nwe consider the integral\nK = 1\u222b\n0\n\u03c6hol(z) zz\u0304\nz\u0304 Az\u0304 +Bdz = 8 A \u2212 B A2 I , (C.7)\nwith\nI = 8 \u03c0 1\u222b 0 dz( z + BA )\u221a z(1\u2212 z) , (C.8)\nwhich enters the diagram AV4 (structure TA). Using again the change of variable z = cos2 t, and then introducing u = e2it, a careful analysis of the pole structure in the complex u-plane in the various configurations depending on the signs of A, B, and on the position of A/B with respect to 0 and 1, which are related to the values of \u03be and \u03b1, leads to the following result valid for any configuration:\nI = 8AB \u221a\n1 B3(A+B) . (C.9)\nWe stress that this result is valid for any values of \u03b1 and \u03be allowed by the kinematics of our process, and therefore, its form should not be modified during implementation.\nNext, the diagram AV4 (structure TB) involves the integral\nM = 1\u222b\n0\n\u03c6hol(z) zz\u0304\nz\u03042 Az\u0304 +Bdz = 8 A2\n( A 2 \u2212B ) + B 2 A3 I . (C.10)\nThe diagram AV5 involves, for the structure TA, the integral I and for the structure TB the integral\nL = 1\u222b\n0\n\u03c6hol(z) zz\u0304 (z\u0304 \u2212 z)(1\u2212 \u03b1\u0304z) Az\u0304 +B dz = 2\u03b1\u0304M + (3\u03b1\u2212 1)K \u2212 \u03b1 I A . (C.11)\nThe diagram BV4 involves, for both TA and TB structures, the integral\nR = 1\u222b\n0\n\u03c6hol(z) zz\u0304 zz\u0304 Az\u0304 +Bdz = K \u2212M . (C.12)\nThe diagram BV5 involves, for the structure TA,\nS = 1\u222b\n0\n\u03c6hol(z) zz\u0304\nz Az\u0304 +Bdz = I A \u2212K , (C.13)\nand\nT = 1\u222b\n0\n\u03c6hol(z) zz\u0304\nz2\nAz\u0304 +Bdz = M \u2212 2K + I A , (C.14)\nfor the structure TB.\n\u2013 44 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 2 4 1\nWe now consider the axial structure. For the diagram AA4 , the structure TA5 only involves the integral K while the structure TB5 involves the integral\nU = 1\u222b\n0\n\u03c6hol(z) zz\u0304 z\u0304(z\u0304 \u2212 z) Az\u0304 +B dz = 2M \u2212K . (C.15)\nFor the diagram AA4 , the structure TA5 involves the integral\nV = 1\u222b\n0\n\u03c6hol(z) zz\u0304 2\u2212 \u03b1\u2212 2\u03b1\u0304z Az\u0304 +B dz = \u03b1 I A + 2\u03b1\u0304K , (C.16)\nwhile the structure TB5 involves the integral\nW = 1\u222b\n0\n\u03c6hol(z) zz\u0304 1\u2212 2\u03b1\u0304z Az\u0304 +B dz = (2\u03b1\u2212 1) I A + 2\u03b1\u0304K . (C.17)\nFor the diagram BA4 , the integrals are the same as for BV4 . For the diagram BA5 , for the structure TA5 , the integral involved is\nZ = 1\u222b\n0\n\u03c6hol(z) zz\u0304 z(1\u2212 2z) Az\u0304 +B dz = \u22122M + 3K \u2212 I A . (C.18)\nIn this way, all the integrals corresponding to any Lorentz structure are fully defined.\nC.2 Integration over x and explicit expressions\nWe now pass to the convolution with GPDs. The integration over x can only be done numerically, and involves a set of basic integrals which we now discuss.\nThe new following set of basic integrals w.r.t. the case of asymptotic DA is relevant for the holographic DA:\n\u03c71 = \u222b 1\u221a\n(x\u2212 \u03be + i )(x+ \u03be + i ) 1 2\u03be + \u03b1\u0304(x\u2212 \u03be + i ) sgn(x+ \u03be)f(x)dx , (C.19)\n\u03c72 = \u222b 1\u221a\n(x\u2212 \u03be + i )(x+ \u03be + i ) 1 [2\u03be + \u03b1\u0304(x\u2212 \u03be + i )]2 sgn(x+ \u03be)f(x)dx , (C.20)\n\u03c73 = \u222b 1\u221a\n(x\u2212 \u03be + i )(x+ \u03be + i ) 1 x+ \u03be + i sgn(x+ \u03be)f(x)dx . (C.21)\nIn practice, in order to deal with convergent integrals around the pole located at\nxp = \u2212\u03be 1 + \u03b1 1\u2212 \u03b1, (C.22)\n\u2013 45 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 2 4 1\none should rather consider the three following integrals:\n\u03c7a = \u222b [sgn(x+ \u03be)\u221a\nx2 \u2212 \u03be2 + \u03b1\u03042 \u221a \u03b1\u03be\n] 1\n2\u03be + \u03b1\u0304(x\u2212 \u03be)f(x)dx , (C.23)\n\u03c7b = \u222b {[sgn(x+ \u03be)\u221a\nx2 \u2212 \u03be2 + \u03b1\u03042 \u221a \u03b1\u03be\n] 1\n[2\u03be + \u03b1\u0304(x\u2212 \u03be)]2 + (1 + \u03b1)\u03b1\u03048\u03be2\u03b1 \u221a \u03b1 1 2\u03be + \u03b1\u0304(x\u2212 \u03be)\n} f(x)dx ,\n(C.24) \u03c7c = \u222b sgn(x+ \u03be)\u221a\nx2 \u2212 \u03be2 f(x)dx .

The building block integrals Ie and If are defined in appendix D of [15]. Specifying the symmetry of the GPD implies that\nIf = \u2212I\u0304e , (symmetric GPD) , (C.31) If = I\u0304e , (anti-symmetric GPD) , (C.32)\nwhere I\u0304e \u2261 I\u2217e .

Recall that the sums of diagrams are normalised by s, so that they are dimensionless, see appendix D in [15]. Note also that the building block integral \u03c7a cancels in the sum of diagrams.\nC.3 Analytical results in the case of a constant GPD\nAs a benchmark, we now give the analytical results for the particular case, though unrealistic, of a constant GPD (taken to be 1) for which the x integration can be performed analytically.\nThe building block integrals from the asymptotic DA case (see appendix D in [15] for their definitions) then read\nIb = \u2212 2 (1\u2212 \u03b1)2 1 1\u2212 x2p , (C.37)\nIc = 1 2\u03b1\u03b1\u0304\u03be ( 1\u2212 x2p ) + 2xp ln\u03b1 \u03b1\u03043 ( 1\u2212 x2p )2 \u2212 1 + x2p \u03b1\u03043 ( 1\u2212 x2p )2 ln 1 + \u03be1\u2212 \u03be + 18\u03b1\u0304\u03b12\u03be2 ( ln 1 + \u03be1\u2212 \u03be \u2212 ln 1\u2212 xp 1 + xp ) \u2212 18\u03b1\u0304\u03be2 ( \u2212 ln 1 + \u03be1\u2212 \u03be \u2212 ln 1\u2212 xp 1 + xp ) , (C.38)\nIe = ln 1\u2212 \u03be 1 + \u03be \u2212 i\u03c0 , (C.39)\nIh = 1\n1\u2212 \u03b1\n{ ln(1\u2212 xp) ln\n1 + \u03be \u03b1(1\u2212 \u03be) \u2212 ln(\u22121\u2212 xp) ln 1\u2212 \u03be \u03b1(1 + \u03be) \u2212 ln\u03b1 ( ln 1 + \u03be1\u2212 \u03be \u2212 i\u03c0 ) +2 ln 1 + \u03be1\u2212 \u03be ln 1\u2212 \u03b1 2\u03be \u2212 Li2 ( \u2212(1\u2212 \u03b1)(1\u2212 \u03be)2\u03be ) \u2212 Li2 ((1\u2212 \u03b1)(1\u2212 \u03be) 2\u03b1\u03be\n) +Li2 ((1\u2212 \u03b1)(1 + \u03be) 2\u03be ) + Li2 ( \u2212(1\u2212 \u03b1)(1 + \u03be)2\u03b1\u03be )} , (C.40)\nIi = 1\n1\u2212 \u03b1(ln(1\u2212 xp)\u2212 ln(\u22121\u2212 xp)) .

            "text": "D.1 Weizs\u00e4cker-Williams distribution\nTo obtain the photon flux from an incoming lepton, the Weizs\u00e4cker-Williams distribution is used. This is given by [42, 43]\nf(x) = \u03b1em2\u03c0 2m2ex ( 1 Q2max \u2212 1\u2212 x m2ex 2 ) + ( (1\u2212 x)2 + 1 ) ln Q 2 max(1\u2212x) m2ex 2 x  , (D.1) where x is the fraction of energy lost by the incoming electron, me is the electron mass and Q2max is the typical maximal value of the virtuality of the exchanged photon, which we take to be 0.1GeV2 here. Using the expression for x as a function of the incoming electron energy Ee in the target rest frame,\nx[S\u03b3N ] = S\u03b3N \u2212M2\n2EeM , (D.2)\nit is easy to obtain integrated cross-sections at the level of the eN process, using the relation\n\u03c3eN = \u222b \u03c3\u03b3N (x) f(x) dx = \u222b S\u03b3N max S\u03b3N crit 1 2EeM \u03c3\u03b3N (x[S\u03b3N ]) f(x[S\u03b3N ]) dS\u03b3N . (D.3)\nThe limits of integration can be found as follows: the minimum value S\u03b3Ncrit ' 4.75 GeV2 corresponds to the imposed necessary kinematical cuts, see appendix E. On the other hand, S\u03b3Nmax can be found by finding the value of S\u03b3N for which f in (D.1) vanishes, which corresponds to x[S\u03b3N ] \u2248 1 in (D.2). For example, at JLab Hall B (CLAS12), with Ee = 12 GeV, one finds that S\u03b3Nmax ' 23GeV2.\nD.2 Photon flux in UPC\nD.2.1 Derivation\nTo facilitate the reader, we provide here the main steps of the derivation of the photon flux from a heavy nucleus in ultra-peripheral collisions (UPCs) [44\u201346]. UPCs are dominated by photon interactions. To extract the photon flux from heavy ions in UPCs, we follow largely the procedure implemented in STARlight [47], which is a C++ code used in many simulations. The photon flux (number of photons per unit area per unit energy) from a relativistic heavy nucleus is given by\nd3N\u03b3\ndkd2~b = Z\n2\u03b1x2\n\u03c02k|~b|2 K21 (x) , (D.4)\n\u2013 48 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 2 4 1\nwhere b is the impact parameter, k is the energy of the photon, Z is the charge of the heavy nucleus, \u03b1 is the coupling constant of QED, K1 is the modified Bessel function, \u03b3 is the Lorentz factor of the particle emitting the photon, and x = k|~b|\u03b3~c . We note that this equation can be used in any frame, provided both the Lorentz factor \u03b3 and the photon energy k are measured in the same frame. To obtain the photon spectrum, one integrates eq. (D.4) over the impact parameter space, assuming circular symmetry,\ndN\u03b3(k) dk = \u222b bmax bmin db 2\u03c0b d 3N\u03b3 dkd2~b PNOHAD(b) , (D.5)\nwhere PNOHAD(b) is the probability for no hadronic interactions. The exact way PNOHAD(b) is modelled depends on the nuclei in question. For our purposes, we use the Glauber model and hence\nPNOHAD(b) = exp [\u2212\u03c3NNTA(b)] , (D.6)\nwhere TA(b) is the nuclear thickness function. The latter is calculated from the nuclear density function \u03c1A(r) via\nTA(b) = \u222b z\u2217 \u2212z\u2217 dz \u03c1A (\u221a b2 + z2 ) , (D.7)\nwhere z\u2217 is an input to the calculation. The nuclear density is assumed to follow a Woods-Saxon distribution [48], given by\n\u03c1A(r) = \u03c1A0 1 + exp [ r\u2212rA d ] , (D.8) where rA is the heavy ion radius, d is the Woods-Saxon skin depth, and \u03c1A0 is a parameter that is fixed by normalisation, see (D.13). Finally, in (D.6), \u03c3NN , the nucleon-nucleon interaction cross-section, is based on the parameterisation of pp collisions with centre of mass energy \u221a s above 7GeV [49],\n\u03c3NN = ( 33.73 + 0.2838 ln2(r) + 13.67r\u22120.412 \u2212 7.77r\u22120.5626 ) mb , (D.9)\nwhere r \u2261 s1GeV2 . In this way, applying the above results to our case, the photon flux can now be fully determined as a function of the photon energy, through (D.5). To obtain the cross-section, one simply needs to perform the integration\n\u03c3UPC = \u222b dN\u03b3(k) dk \u03c3 [S\u03b3N (k)] dk (D.10)\n= 12M \u222b S\u03b3N max S\u03b3N crit dN\u03b3(S\u03b3N\u2212M 2 2M ) dk \u03c3 [S\u03b3N ] dS\u03b3N , (D.11)\n\u2013 49 \u2013\nH E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 2 4 1\nusing\nS\u03b3N (k) = 2Mk +M2 , (D.12)\nwhere M is the target (proton) mass. A description of the parameters used in the computation of the photon flux is given in the next subsection.\nD.2.2 Parameters used for the calculation of the photon flux\nSince we focus on p-Pb collisions at UPC, the case where the source of the photon flux is the heavy ion dominates. The parameters involving the Pb nucleus which we choose are shown in table 6.\nIn fact, \u03c1A0 is fixed by normalisation, by requiring\u222b d3r \u03c1 A 0\n1 + exp [ r\u2212rA d ] = A . (D.13) For the limits of the z-integration in eq. (D.7) for the thickness function TA(b), we\nchoose z\u2217 = 15 fm. Finally, for the impact parameter integration in eq. (D.5), we choose the limits of integration to be\nbmin = 0.7Rsum , (D.14)\nbmax = 2Rsum + 8 \u03b3~c k , (D.15)\nwhere Rsum is the sum of the nuclear radii, equal to rA + rp. Finally, we compute the Lorentz factor \u03b3A of the Pb nucleus in the p rest frame to be\n\u03b3A = 3.804\u00d7 107 , (D.16)\nusing a proton energy of 6.5TeV and a Pb nucleus energy of 82\u00d7 6.5 = 533TeV.\n\u2013 50 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 2 4 1\nE t-dependence of GPDs and phase space integration\nIn this appendix, we briefly describe various aspects related to the phase space integration over (\u2212u\u2032) and (\u2212t) to obtain the single differential cross-section. The discussion here is short in order to avoid repetition, since this has already been treated in appendix E of [15]. First, we note that the t-dependence of the GPD is modelled by a simplistic ansatz, namely a factorised dipole form,\nFH(t) = (tmin \u2212 C)2\n(t\u2212 C)2 , (E.1)\nwith C = 0.71 GeV2. We note that in the previous publications [15, 20], the numerator in FH(t) was simply taken to be C2. We improve this here by replacing it with (tmin \u2212 C)2, which cancels the corresponding contribution at \u2212t = (\u2212t)min in the fully differential cross-section, which is evaluated at \u2212t = (\u2212t)min. The single differential cross-section then reads\nd\u03c3 dM2\u03b3\u03c0 = \u222b (\u2212t)max (\u2212t)min d(\u2212t) \u222b (\u2212u\u2032)max (\u2212u\u2032)min d(\u2212u\u2032) F 2H(t)\u00d7 d\u03c3 d(\u2212t) d(\u2212u\u2032)dM2\u03b3\u03c0 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2212t=(\u2212t)min . (E.2)\nThe phase space integration in the (\u2212t,\u2212u\u2032) plane should take care of several cuts. First, since we rely on factorisation at large angle, we enforce the two constraints \u2212u\u2032 > (\u2212u\u2032)min , and \u2212t\u2032 > (\u2212t\u2032)min , and take (\u2212u\u2032)min = (\u2212t\u2032)min = 1 GeV2 . Next, the variable (\u2212t) varies from (\u2212t)min, determined by kinematics, up to a maximal value (\u2212t)max which we fix to be (\u2212t)max = 0.5 GeV2. For the details of how (\u2212t)min is obtained, we refer the reader to appendix E of [15]. Due to the applied kinematical cuts, there are two values of M2\u03b3\u03c0 for which the volume of the phase space vanishes, M2\u03b3\u03c0 crit \u2248 1.52GeV2, which defines the lower boundary for M2\u03b3\u03c0 and is independent of S\u03b3N , and M2\u03b3\u03c0Max, which defines the upper boundary for M2\u03b3\u03c0 and is a function of S\u03b3N . The value of M2\u03b3\u03c0Max decreases as S\u03b3N decreases. Therefore, the minimum value of S\u03b3N is obtained from the constraint M2\u03b3\u03c0 crit = M2\u03b3\u03c0Max, leading to S\u03b3Ncrit ' 4.75 GeV2."

            "text": "F.1 Kleiss-Stirling spinor techniques\nIn this appendix, we present the details of the derivation of the formulae for the polarisation asymmetries using the Kleiss-Stirling spinor techniques [50]. This involves the introduction of two (arbitrary) four-vectors k0 and k1, satisfying\nk20 = 0 , k21 = \u22121 , k0 \u00b7 k1 = 0 . (F.1)\nOne then defines the negative helicity spinor product at k0 through\nu\u2212(k0)u\u0304\u2212(k0) = 1 2 ( 1\u2212 \u03b35 ) /k0 . (F.2)\n\u2013 51 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 2 4 1\nThe corresponding positive helicity state is obtained from the above by\nu+(k0) = /k1u\u2212(k0) . (F.3)\nA general spinor for lightlike momentum l can be obtained from the above ones through\nu\u03bb(l) = 1\u221a\n2l \u00b7 k0 /lu\u2212\u03bb(k0) , (F.4)\nwhere \u03bb denotes the helicity of the spinor. The only requirement for (F.4) to hold is that l \u00b7 k0 6= 0.\nFor the polarisation vectors, we have\n\u03b5\u00b5\u03bb(l) = 1\u221a\n4r \u00b7 l u\u0304\u03bb(l)\u03b3\u00b5u\u03bb(r) , (F.5)\nwhere r is any lightlike vector not collinear to l or k0. In this way, all spinor products, including the polarisation tensors, can be expressed as a Dirac trace at the amplitude level. For our process, we find it convenient to choose the reference vectors such that\nk\u00b50 \u2261 p \u00b5 \u03c0 = (2.9) , (F.6)\nk\u00b51 \u2261 \u2212 2\ns|~pt| \u03b5pnp\u22a5\u00b5 (F.7)\nr \u2261 p . (F.8)\nOne can easily verify that the above choice satisfies all the required constraints. Since we are interested in polarisation asymmetries w.r.t. the incoming photon, we first compute the polarisation vectors corresponding to the circularly polarised states. We find that\n\u03b5\u00b1(q) = 1\u221a 2 [ p\u00b5\u22a5 |~pt| \u00b1 ik\u00b51 ] . (F.9)\nAs we will later show, the circular asymmetry w.r.t. the incoming photon vanishes for an unpolarised target, which is the case we consider here. Therefore, what we really need are the polarisation vectors corresponding to linearly polarised states. These can be computed using13\n\u03b5x = 1\u221a 2 [\u03b5+ + \u03b5\u2212] , (F.10)\n\u03b5y = i\u221a 2 [\u03b5\u2212 \u2212 \u03b5+] . (F.11)\nThus, we have\n\u03b5x(q) = p\u00b5\u22a5 |~pt| , (F.12)\n\u03b5y(q) = k\u00b51 . (F.13) 13Note that the sign conventions used here are opposite to those of [51].\n\u2013 52 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 2 4 1\nThus, one readily obtains\n\u03b5\u2217\u00b5x (q)\u03b5\u03bdx(q) = p\u00b5\u22a5p \u03bd \u22a5\n|~pt|2 , (F.14)\n\u03b5\u2217\u00b5y (q)\u03b5\u03bdy(q) = k \u00b5 1 k \u03bd 1 . (F.15)\nAs a consistency check, we note that the sum of the above two equations is exactly \u2212g\u00b5\u03bd\u22a5 .\nF.2 Expressions for polarisation asymmetries\nAmplitudes corresponding to specific linear polarisation states can be defined as\nMx = \u03b5\u00b5x(q)M\u00b5 , My = \u03b5\u00b5y (q)M\u00b5 . (F.16)\nThe linear polarisation asymmetry (LPA) can then be defined as\nLPA \u2261 d\u03c3x \u2212 d\u03c3y d\u03c3x + d\u03c3y , (F.17)\nwhere d\u03c3i (i = x, y) denotes the cross-section obtained by squaring the appropriate polarised amplitudeMi. Note that our notation for d\u03c3i is loose and is used to represent either fully differential, single differential or fully integrated cross-sections, depending on the context.\nFor convenience, let us decompose the amplitude as (c.f. equations (4.13) to (4.16))\nM = CATA + CBTB + CA5TA5 + CB5TB5 , (F.18)\ni.e. in terms of the tensor structures defined in (4.13) and (4.14). We note that the coefficients of the tensor structures include the spinors of the nucleons, as well as Dirac matrices associated with the definition of the GPDs. More explicitly, using (4.15) and (4.16),\nCA \u2261 1\nn \u00b7 p u\u0304(p2, \u03bb2)/n\u03b35u(p1, \u03bb1)H\u0303\u03c0A(\u03be, t) , (F.19)\nCB \u2261 1\nn \u00b7 p u\u0304(p2, \u03bb2)/n\u03b35u(p1, \u03bb1)H\u0303\u03c0B(\u03be, t) , (F.20)\nCA5 \u2261 1\nn \u00b7 p u\u0304(p2, \u03bb2)/nu(p1, \u03bb1)H\u03c0A5(\u03be, t) , (F.21)\nCB5 \u2261 1\nn \u00b7 p u\u0304(p2, \u03bb2)/nu(p1, \u03bb1)H\u03c0B5(\u03be, t) . (F.22)\nBy squaring the amplitude, and summing over the polarisation \u03bbk of the outgoing photon, we obtain\u2211\n\u03bbk\n|Mx|2 = |CA|2 + |~pt|4|CB|2 + s2\n4 |~pt| 4|CB5 |2 \u2212 2|~pt|2Re(C\u2217ACB) , (F.23)\n\u2211 \u03bbk |My|2 = |CA|2 + s2 4 |~pt| 4|CA5 |2 . (F.24)\nFrom the above polarised amplitude squared, one can easily compute the LPAs at various levels (from fully differential to integrated).\n\u2013 53 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 2 4 1\nF.3 LPA in the lab frame\nHere, we show how to write the LPA using polarisation vectors as measured in the lab frame, which we denote by LPALab. We start with the polarised amplitudes in the lab frame, which are defined as\nM\u0304x = \u03b5\u0304\u00b5x(q)M\u00b5 , M\u0304y = \u03b5\u0304\u00b5y (q)M\u00b5 , (F.25)\nanalogous to (F.16). Using the rotation in (5.7), the polarised amplitudes in the lab frame can then be written as\nM\u0304x = cos \u03b8 \u03b5\u00b5x(q)M\u00b5 \u2212 sin \u03b8 \u03b5\u00b5y (q)M\u00b5 , (F.26)\nM\u0304y = sin \u03b8 \u03b5\u00b5x(q)M\u00b5 + cos \u03b8 \u03b5\u00b5y (q)M\u00b5 . (F.27)\nTherefore, we have that\u2211 \u03bb1,\u03bb2,\u03bbk [ |M\u0304x|2 \u2212 |M\u0304y|2 ] = \u2211 \u03bb1,\u03bb2,\u03bbk { cos 2\u03b8 ( |Mx|2 \u2212 |My|2 ) \u2212 2 sin 2\u03b8Re [ MxM\u2217y ] } .\n(F.28)\nIt turns out that the second term in the above equation vanishes. To see why this is the case, consider the following: the second term can be written as\u2211\n\u03bb1,\u03bb2,\u03bbk\nRe [ MxM\u2217y ] = Re [ (\u03b5\u00b5xM\u00b5) ( \u03b5\u03bdyM\u03bd )\u2217] \u2261 Re [ MxM \u2217 y ] . (F.29)\nThe term proportional to \u03b5x \u00b7 \u03b5\u2217y vanishes due to the orthogonality of the polarisation vectors, and is thus absent from the above equation. Now, the structure M\u00b5 consists of M\u00b5V corresponding to the contribution from the vector GPD, and M\u00b5A for the contribution from the axial GPD. From the tensor structure decomposition in (F.18), one can write them as\nM\u00b5V = p \u00b5 \u22a5M (1) V + \u03b5 pnp\u22a5\u00b5M (2) V , (F.30)\nM\u00b5A = p \u00b5 \u22a5MA . (F.31)\nM\u00b5A comes from the TA and TB tensor structures (see (4.14)). As such, the only Lorentz tensor that can carry the transverse index is p\u00b5\u22a5. On the other hand, M \u00b5 V has two possible Lorentz structures, namely p\u00b5\u22a5 and \u03b5pnp\u22a5 , since it comes from the TA5 and TB5 tensor structures. Now, for the term MxM\u2217y to survive, \u03b5\u00b5x needs to be contracted with p \u00b5 \u22a5, while \u03b5\u00b5y needs to be contracted with \u03b5pnp\u22a5\u00b5. There are only 2 ways that this can happen: the first option is through interference between vector and axial parts, which vanishes due to the sum over target helicities. The second way is through the mixing of the two terms in M\u00b5V . Comparing (F.30) with (4.14), one finds that M (1)V in fact corresponds to the TB5 structure, while M (2)V corresponds to the TA5 structure. One can then deduce that this contribution vanishes due to the sum over the polarisation of the outgoing photon. Therefore, MxM\u2217y vanishes, and thus\n|M\u0304x|2 \u2212 |M\u0304y|2 = cos 2\u03b8 ( |Mx|2 \u2212 |My|2 ) . (F.32)\n\u2013 54 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 2 4 1\nIn fact, the modulation by cos 2\u03b8 is expected from physical arguments. We first note that, after summing over all other polarisations, the only transverse direction left is that defined by p\u22a5, since we work in the limit that \u2206\u22a5 = 0. Consequently, the result must be symmetric in \u03b8 \u2192 \u2212\u03b8. Moreover, from the definition of the LPA, reversing the direction of both \u03b5x and \u03b5y should leave the result invariant, which implies that \u03b8 \u2192 \u03b8+\u03c0 should also be a symmetry. Therefore, the result should depend on cos 2n\u03b8 for integer n. Finally, the absence of any further symmetry implies n = 1.\nF.4 Vanishing of the circular asymmetry\nFor the circular polarised amplitudes, the analogues of (F.23) and (F.24) are given by\u2211 \u03bbk |M+|2 = 1 2 [ 2|CA|2 + |~pt|4|CB|2 + s2 4 |~pt| 4|CA5 |2 + s2 4 |~pt| 4|CB5 |2 \u2212 2|~pt|2Re(C\u2217ACB)\n+ s|~pt|2Im ( CA ( C\u2217A5 + C \u2217 B5 ) + |~pt|2CA5C\u2217B ) ] , (F.33)\n\u2211 \u03bbk |M\u2212|2 = 1 2 [ 2|CA|2 + |~pt|4|CB|2 + s2 4 |~pt| 4|CA5 |2 + s2 4 |~pt| 4|CB5 |2 \u2212 2|~pt|2Re(C\u2217ACB)\n\u2212 s|~pt|2Im ( CA ( C\u2217A5 + C \u2217 B5 ) + |~pt|2CA5C\u2217B ) ] . (F.34)\nSo, \u2211 \u03bbk |M+|2 \u2212 \u2211 \u03bbk |M\u2212|2 = s|~pt|2Im ( CA ( C\u2217A5 + C \u2217 B5 ) + |~pt|2CA5C\u2217B ) . (F.35) An interesting feature of the circular asymmetry is that it only contains terms that mix vector GPD and axial GPD contributions (A and B, with A5 and B5). Thus, when averaging over the target helicity, it can be shown that all terms on the r.h.s. of (F.35) vanish. Indeed, using equations (F.19) to (F.22), we obtain, after averaging and summing over the target helicities,\n1 2 \u2211 \u03bb1,\u03bb2 \u2211 \u03bbk |M+|2\u2212 \u2211 \u03bbk |M\u2212|2 = |~pt|2(n\u00b7p) [H\u0303\u03c0A (H\u2217\u03c0A5 +H\u2217\u03c0B5)+|~pt|2H\u03c0A5H\u0303\u2217\u03c0B]tr[/p2/n\u03b35/p1/n]\n= 0 . (F.36)\nThis shows that for an unpolarised target, the circular asymmetry is identically zero. From a more physical point of view, the vanishing of the circular asymmetry is a consequence of parity invariance of QED and QCD. In particular, from [52], one deduces that the amplitude for our process,M\u03bb2\u03bbk ;\u03bb1\u03bbq , has to obey the relation\nM\u03bb2\u03bbk ;\u03bb1\u03bbq = \u03b7 (\u22121)\u03bb1\u2212\u03bbq\u2212(\u03bb2\u2212\u03bbk)M\u2212\u03bb2\u2212\u03bbk ;\u2212\u03bb1\u2212\u03bbq , (F.37)\nwhere \u03b7 represents a phase factor related to intrinsic spin. From this, we can deduce that\u2211 \u03bbi, i 6=q |M\u03bb2\u03bbk ;\u03bb1+| 2 = \u2211 \u03bbi, i 6=q |M\u03bb2\u03bbk ;\u03bb1\u2212| 2 , (F.38) which implies that the circular asymmetry vanishes identically for an unpolarised target.\n\u2013 55 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 2 4 1\nOpen Access.
