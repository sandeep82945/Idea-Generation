After intravenous injection of Lipid 5-containing LNPs, 14C-containing Lipid 5 ([14C]Lipid 5) and radiolabeled metabolites ([14C]metabolites) were rapidly distributed, with peak concentrations reached within 1 hour in most tissues. After 10 hours, [14C]Lipid 5 and [14C]metabolites concentrated primarily in the urinary and digestive tracts. By 24 hours, [14C]Lipid 5 and [14C]metabolites were localized almost exclusively in the liver and intestines, with few or no concentrations detected in non-excretory systems, which is suggestive of hepatobiliary and renal clearance. [14C]Lipid 5 and [14C]metabolites were completely cleared within 168 hours (7 days). Biodistribution profiles were similar between QWBA and LC-MS/MS techniques, pigmented and nonpigmented rats, and male and female rats, excluding the reproductive organs. In conclusion, the rapid clearance through known excretory systems, with no evidence of redistribution for Lipid 5 or accumulation of [14C]metabolites, provides confidence for the safe and effective use of Lipid 5-containing LNPs.\nThis article has not been copyedited and formatted.

            "text": "RNA-based therapeutics and vaccines represent a novel and expanding class of medicines that have been invaluable during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The global deployment of mRNA COVID-19 vaccines was a prominent milestone for those modalities, building confidence in mRNA research and further substantiating investigations of other mRNAbased medicines, such as enzyme replacement and enhanced cell therapies (Damase et al., 2021). The success of these mRNA therapies depends on their encapsulation in lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), assisting in the transport of exogenous nucleic acids to tissues while simultaneously preventing degradation by endo- and exonucleases (Guevara et al., 2020; Hou et al., 2021). Lipid nanoparticles are non-covalent assemblies of multiple molecular components and are typically composed of ionizable lipids, phospholipids, cholesterol, and polyethylene glycol (PEG)functionalized lipids (Lee et al., 2013; Hassett et al., 2019; Hou et al., 2021).It has been established that xenobiotic components, such as PEG-functionalized and ionizable lipids stabilize LNP formulation throughout manufacturing and storage, assist in cell surface binding, cellular uptake, and facilitate mRNA endosomal escape (Chan et al., 2012; Shi et al., 2021; Kalyanram et al., 2022). However, studies that assess the in vivo fates of LNP-mRNA formulations have focused on the mRNA distribution, and only to a much lesser extent, the biodistribution and clearance of LNP components and their metabolites (Hou et al., 2021). A comprehensive analysis to evaluate the biodistribution and clearance of both the mRNA and LNP constituents is crucial to fully assess the safety and efficacy of these components in both pre-clinical and clinical settings and inform the continued development of improved mRNALNP based medicines.\nThis article has not been copyedited and formatted.

The tissue-specific distribution could potentially be facilitated by multiple factors, including LNP particle size, lipid components, and incorporation of specific targeting proteins, such as monoclonal antibodies on the LNP surface (Veiga et al., 2020; Zhang et al., 2021; Di et al., 2022). Although these properties of LNPs are enticing for future drug development, reports have identified variability in delivery of these constructs with greater inflammatory responses associated with the use of xenobiotic lipids which is not apparent with naturally-occurring LNP components (Ndeupen et al., 2021). As naturally occurring LNP components (e.g., lipids, cholesterol, cholesterol esters) undergo in vivo processing similar to that of endogenous analogs and xenobiotic lipid clearance routes are typically unknown (Scioli Montoto et al., 2020), a thorough assessment of safety and reactogenicity after LNP administration is needed. It is thus crucial that studies focus on both the primary biodistribution of the intact mRNA-LNP as well as the redistribution of its constituents and metabolites to evaluate the immunogenic potential of the intact mRNA-LNP formulation, its constituents, and their metabolites.\nStudies investigating mRNA-LNP biodistribution have traditionally used methods such as intracellular enzymatic reporters to track the delivery of intact encapsulated mRNA into host cells (Hassett et al., 2019; Aldosari et al., 2021; Delehedde et al., 2021; Yang et al., 2021). Such methods provide information on the biodistribution of intact mRNA-LNPs, but because the reporting capacity of these techniques is dependent solely on the viability and successful delivery of the intact mRNA, this method has limited use in determining the in vivo fates of constituents, metabolites, or of damaged mRNA-LNPs (Blakney et al., 2019). To address the limitations\nThis article has not been copyedited and formatted. The final version may differ from this version. DMD Fast Forward.

Analysis techniques included quantitative whole body autoradiography (QWBA) due to its capabilities allowing for assessing distribution profiles of intact and dismantled LNPs depending on the use of suitably radiolabeled constituents. This analysis method in combination with traditional metabolism and elimination studies provide an overview of the physiological fates of Lipid 5 and lipid 5-containing LNPs. QWBA analyses were performed in male and female rats after intravenous (IV) administration of radiolabeled Lipid 5 ([14C]Lipid 5)-containing LNPs encapsulating non-translating factor IX (NTFIX) mRNA. This report includes the results of QWBA performed to assess the distribution of Lipid 5 and its 14C-containing metabolites ([14C]metabolites) after IV administration of the same NTFIX mRNA-encapsulating, [14C]Lipid 5-containing LNP as well traditional assessments of lipid, mRNA, and expressed protein from an IV administered therapeutic LNP of similar lipid composition that encapsulates a similarly sized mRNAs. The ability of QWBA to track both intact [14C]Lipid 5 and its [14C]metabolites provides a detailed understanding of the in vivo distribution and persistence of Lipid 5-derived compounds, makes it complementary to standard LC-MS/MS techniques used for biodistribution studies in LNP component in vivo fate assessments. In addition, this study assessed the impact of endogenous pigmentation (i.e., melanin; (Solon, 2015) on the biodistribution profiles of Lipid 5 and its radiolabeled metabolites in pigmented (Long-Evans) and nonpigmented (Sprague Dawley) rats. Details regarding Lipid 5 metabolism and elimination following IV administration in male and female rats will be reported separately (Burdette et al., manuscript in preparation).\nThis article has not been copyedited and formatted.

Lipid 5 was synthesized as previously described (Sabnis et al., 2018) and labelled with 14C at the proximal carbon of the ethanolamine aliphatic chain linked to the tertiary nitrogen (Eurofins; Columbia, MO; Figure 1). The radiolabeled site was selected as it was identified to be the most protected from known ester hydrolysis and \u03b2-oxidation degradation pathways for Lipid 5 (Burdette et al., manuscript in preparation). The purity of Lipid 5 and [14C]Lipid 5 were determined as 95% chemical purity and 99% radiochemical purity, respectively.\nmRNA and LNP production. Complete N1-methylpseudouridine-substituted mRNA was synthesized in vitro from a linearized DNA template containing the 5\u2032 untranslated region, the 3\u2032 untranslated region, and a poly-A tail, as described previously (Sabnis et al., 2018). After purification, mRNA (NTFIX for [14C]Lipid 5-containing LNPs and similarly sized mRNA for Lipid 5-containing LNPs) was diluted in citrate buffer (Teknova) and frozen for subsequent use. LNP formulations were prepared by ethanol drop nanoprecipitation as described previously (Sabnis et al., 2018). In short, Lipid 5 or [14C]Lipid 5, dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine, cholesterol, and PEGylated lipid (CordenPharma) were dissolved in ethanol (Merck KGaA) and combined with acidified mRNA at a ratio of 3:1 (aqueous:ethanol). The product was diluted in citrate-buffered saline, maintained, and combined with a Tris buffer (pH 7.75) followed by a matched buffered excipient solution. The resulting formulation was filtered through an 0.8/0.2- \u00b5m filter (Pall Corporation), buffer exchanged into sucrose containing Tris buffer (pH 7.4), and concentrated using tangential flow filtration. Both radiolabeled and non-radiolabeled LNPs had similar lipid composition, size (60-120 nm), storage and serum stability regardless of encapsulated mRNA (dynamic light scattering on a DynaPro Plate Reader [Wyatt; Goleta, CA]).\nThis article has not been copyedited and formatted.

Rapid biodistribution of intact Lipid 5 was seen in most tissues, achieving maximum observed concentration (Tmax) at the earliest time tested (0.16 hours) (Table 1; Figure 4) with only the liver (Figure 4B) and spleen (Figure 4G) reaching Tmax levels at 1 hour post dose.

            "text": "The technology behind mRNA-based medicines has developed rapidly over the last decade and, in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, mRNA medicines have demonstrated their safety and effectiveness as vaccines (Polack et al., 2020; Baden et al., 2021). While there now exists a greater understanding regarding the utility of mRNA-based medicines, the biodistribution profiles of LNPs and their constituents as well as the drivers influencing their biodistribution are less well understood. With the development of novel therapeutic and prophylactic mRNA-LNP modalities, many of which incorporate xenobiotic constituents, an in-depth biodistribution profile analysis is necessary to understand the in vivo fates and factors that influence the in vivo exposure of these medicines and their constituents. These data will inform the evolving clinical evaluation strategy as well as providing insight into future mRNA-LNP product development. In this study, we showed that after IV administration of Lipid 5, a xenobiotic amino lipid used in LNP formulations, rapidly distributes throughout rat tissues in vivo, with exposure directed primarily toward the liver, spleen, lung, and kidneys. In addition, we showed that Lipid 5 and its [14C]metabolites are undetectable in most tissues within 7 days (168 hours). Our findings showed similar distribution profiles in both male and female, pigmented and nonpigmented rats, suggesting minimal influence of sex or pigmentation in exposure of Lipid 5 and its [14C]metabolites. The findings support the use of non-radioactive analyses in rat biodistribution models to assess the efficacy and safety of Lipid 5-containing LNPs in a preclinical setting.\nThe tissue distribution analysis using [14C]Lipid 5-containing LNPs showed rapid distribution of Lipid 5 and its [14C]metabolites throughout all tissues tested within the first hour, localizing primarily in the digestive and urinary systems (Figure 2 and 3). Ten hours after IV LNP administration, the majority of the remaining radioactivity was eliminated from the peripheral\nThis article has not been copyedited and formatted.

Notably, the levels observed at the 10-hour timepoint were much lower than that of the same tissues 1 hour after the [14C]Lipid 5-containing LNP was administered. By 24 hours, the majority of radioactivity was exclusively distributed within the digestive system, with minimal 14C detected in other organ systems. The localization and progression over time of 14C in the liver, small intestine, and large intestine is suggestive of hepatobiliary clearance with [14C]Lipid 5 and its [14C]metabolites excreted into bile and eliminated via feces (Kok-Yong and Lawrence, 2015); this predicted clearance pathway is similar to previous studies examining LNP clearance using fluorescent-dye-labeled LNPs (Press et al., 2014). The localization of 14C in the kidneys and intra-bladder urine is also consistent with observation from other studies where the majority of radioactivity (62%) from labelled Lipid 5-containing LNPs administered to SD rats were excreted through urine, primarily as oxidative metabolites produced via ester hydrolysis\nand -oxidation of Lipid 5 (Burdette et al., manuscript in preparation). Excluding the digestive\nand urinary system, other organs with high observed levels of radioactivity were the adrenal glands, lungs, spleen, and lymph nodes, which were consistent with biodistribution profiles previously reported for RNA encapsulating LNPs (Chen et al., 2019; EMA, 2021; Di et al., 2022). In female SD and LE rats, high concentrations of Lipid 5 were observed in the ovaries, but with insufficient duration of exposure to calculate an AUC. This observed exposure could potentially be attributed to accumulation within the cumulus cell layers surrounding the oocytes, as has been reported for nanoparticle delivery systems previously (Hou and Zhu, 2017); however, detailed analysis is needed to confirm that hypothesis. Excluding reproductive organs, similar trends in 14C biodistribution were observed between male and female rats, with\nThis article has not been copyedited and formatted.

The study did not find high or increasing concentrations of 14C in non-excretory systems post initial administration in male and female SD and LE rats, which suggests that both [14C]Lipid 5 and its [14C]metabolites are rapidly eliminated rather than extensively redistributed throughout the body, consistent with observations from other studies (Caldwell et al., 1995). The lack of an observed difference in 14C biodistribution between pigmented (LE) and nonpigmented (SD) rats suggests a minimal influence of endogenous pigmentation such as melanin on intravenously administered Lipid 5 exposure. These findings are expected to be translatable to Lipid 5-containing LNP in vivo exposure studies in other animal species.\nBiodistribution analysis of Lipid 5 by using LC-MS/MS was consistent with biodistributions from the QWBA studies. Lipid 5 and mRNA exposure after administration of mRNA-LNPs concentrated primarily within the plasma, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidney, with the most rapid clearance occurring in the plasma, The longest duration of exposure was in the spleen, consistent with previous reports for mRNA-encapsulating LNPs (Lee et al., 2010; Bahl et al., 2017). As described previously, the differential tissue uptake of intact LNPs into cells in combination with dissimilar tissue perfusion rates may provide an explanation for the observed inter-tissue exposure and timing differences (Currie, 2018). Also, the delay between peak protein expression (Table 3 and Figure 6) and peak Lipid 5 (Table 1 and Figure 4) and mRNA exposure (Table 2 and Figure 5) is consistent with the necessity for cellular uptake and endosomal release prior to target protein translation (Alfagih et al., 2020). Although these may be plausible explanations for the observations made, additional research is needed to test these mechanistic hypotheses.\nBoth QWBA and LC-MS/MS analyses performed on similar LNPs encapsulating different mRNAs, showed comparable biodistribution profiles for Lipid 5, even with QWBA analyses also\nThis article has not been copyedited and formatted.

This demonstrates the applicability of standard nonradioactive methods for assessing LNP and LNP component tissue distribution for Lipid 5- containing LNPs. Since QWBA allows for the quantification of labelled parent molecules and metabolites (Solon and Kraus, 2001), the similarities observed between QWBA (Lipid 5 and its [14C]metabolites) and LC-MS/MS analysis (intact Lipid 5 only) suggest that [14C]metabolite distribution and persistence in tissues do not differ greatly from that of the parent Lipid 5. Additionally, increasing concentrations of [14C]Lipid 5 and its [14C]metabolites were not observed following the initial increase post administration, suggesting that redistribution of the xenobiotic lipid, and its [14C]metabolites, is not expected. This study also reported similar biodistribution profiles for two different mRNA constructs of similar sizes encapsulated into LNPs with the same lipid constituents, suggesting that the LNP composition rather than the mRNA component is primarily responsible for the biodistribution profile of these mRNA-LNPs. The different mRNA-LNPs delivered support the extrapolation of findings to other mRNA-LNPs of similar morphology and composition. However, this may differ for mRNA-LNPs of other sizes, surface charge, lipid composition, or surface modifications such as antibodies, receptors, or ligands.\nThe modest sample size used for QWBA analyses, with only two animals (1 male and 1 female), assessed for each time point, is in alignment with the industry standard while also minimizing the use of study animals (Solon and Kraus, 2001). Regardless, consistency in the data obtained between individuals supports the robustness of the study design to investigate the in vivo analysis of Lipid 5-containing LNPs. This study contributes to the interpretation and design of preclinical pharmacology and toxicology studies with the potential of extrapolating findings for clinical study considerations (European Medicines Agency, 2021). The extrapolations are\nThis article has not been copyedited and formatted. The final version may differ from this version. DMD Fast Forward.

The similar Lipid 5 biodistribution profiles observed, regardless of pigmentation or sex, and lack of evidence of redistribution of LNP-derived Lipid 5 or its [14C]metabolites demonstrates that the biodistribution strategy used within this study provides a clear understanding of systemic exposure, and thus informs Lipid 5- based LNP clinical safety and drug-drug interactions (DDI). The rapid elimination of all Lipid 5- derived radioactivity from the body in combination with the mechanistic understanding of metabolism and clearance via multiple, ubiquitous, high-capacity systems as detailed in previous studies (Sabnis et al., 2018; Burdette et al., manuscript in preparation). These findings in combination with traditional cytochrome P450s enzyme superfamilies and drug transporter studies (Ci et al., manuscript in preparation) support the overall, low probability of DDI with coadministered medications and thus informs the continued use of Lipid 5 therapeutic LNPs.\nThe results from this study demonstrate that Lipid 5-containing LNPs are distributed throughout tissues after initial IV administration and Lipid 5 is rapidly eliminated thereafter. The time course and radioactivity distribution patterns of [14C]Lipid 5-containing LNPs, suggest that Lipid 5 and its [14C]metabolites undergo elimination by both biliary and renal routes with no indication of redistribution or prolonged metabolite exposure. Furthermore, biodistribution profiles were consistent between pigmented and nonpigmented male and female rats, indicating that neither sex nor pigmentation influences Lipid 5 exposure. The findings of this in vivo preclinical study support the translatability of Lipid 5 exposure profiles in standard rat biodistribution studies to humans as a complement to appropriately designed safety studies due to shared absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion pathways.\u00a0\nThis article has not been copyedited and formatted.
