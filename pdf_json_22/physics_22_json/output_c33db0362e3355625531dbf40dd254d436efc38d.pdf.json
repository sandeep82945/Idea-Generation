    "abstractText": "A new analytic design for multilayer stripline devices in planar circuit technology is presented. The Complementary Split Ring Resonator (CSRR) is used as a sub-wavelength resonant particle, which provides high-Q resonances in a compact size. The electromagnetic field distribution achieved along the stripline enables enhanced excitation of the resonators. An optimal solution for multilayer power dividers is presented, in a configuration in which each output is obtained in different layers and also in a different layer than the input line. The solution is expanded to design different devices, such as diplexers, resonators, and multi-frequency resonators, leading to vertical filters. As the resonances are achieved by stacking resonators, the effective circuit footprint is very compact. The proposed devices can be implemented in a volumetric chip fashion, allowing integration with planar transmission line circuits and flexible output connection placement. A complete analysis of the different devices is proposed, extracting and verifying their equivalent circuit models.",

Introduction\nThe fields distribution in the stripline transmission line, building a TEM mode [1], has allowed this to be the transmission line of choice for the design of different types of devices. The fact that fields are concentrated between ground plane metallization layers provides better isolation against external fields and also avoids their own radiation effects. The use of stripline circuits to build transitions in multi-stacked structures has also been commonly used [2,3]. In multilayer configurations, they are also used as feedline for antennas [4], structures to build multiplexers [5], multilayer couplers [6,7], circulators [8], or for completely different applications such as multi harmonic absorption circuits [9]. An analytical study of slotted stripline was proposed [10], providing insight into the first-order characterization for this type of circuit configurations. In this work, the behavior of a stripline transmission line loaded with Split Ring Resonators (SRR) presented by Pendry [11]\u2014along with its complementary, Complementary Split Ring Resonators (CSRR) [12]\u2014will be proposed. SRRs take advantage of the excitation of axial magnetic fields in order to excite the main quasi-static resonance frequency, which exhibits sub-lambda characteristics (i.e., physical resonator dimensions smaller than those defined electrically by wavelengths, which inherently imply miniaturization capabilities of these structures). In the case of CSRRs, by applying Babinet\u2019s duality principle (interchanging the role of the E and H fields and hence the metallization layers for air gap strips), excitation is achieved by axial E-field components, which are useful in the case of transmission lines such as microstrip lines. In both cases, SRRs as well as CSRRs exhibit bi-anisotropic behavior, although the main quasi-static resonances can be excited by axial H-field and axial E-field components in SRRs and CSRRs, respectively.\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1190. https://doi.org/10.3390/mi13081190 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/micromachines\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1190 2 of 23\nThe integration of SRR and CSRR elements established a starting point for the miniaturization of microwave devices. They have been intensively used for all kinds of devices\u2014 from filters [13,14] to couplers [15,16]\u2014widely used in antenna design [17,18], and in the last years, there has been a growing interest in sensors [19,20] due to the high-quality factor in the quasi static resonance [21]. The first approach of an equivalent circuit of SRR and CSRR was characterized by [22]. This approach was enhanced in different configurations [23\u201325] and for different applications [26]. In this work, the aforementioned designs are used as a starting point to analyze the structures with the enhanced circuits proposed. Most of the designs previously described integrate CSRR or other types of resonant elements embedded within the transmission line topology, taking advantage of the EM field configuration in order to adequately excite\u2014usually, the quasi-static resonance. In order to achieve high frequency selectivity, several resonant elements are employed, usually in a series-cascaded configuration, which increases the circuit length. Moreover, the input and output ports are given by the transmission line routing, which can be limited by factors such as bending ratios in meandered configurations, impedance mismatches, or radiation leakage effects. The proposed circuit topologies in this work take advantage of multistack configurations, which have the capability of reducing the circuit footprint whilst maintaining compatibility with planar transmission line ports. An additional feature of the proposed configurations is the capability of employing different facets of the volumetric multi-stack structure, which enables a higher flexibility in the input/output port location and, hence, in the integration of the devices in systems such as communication transceivers. This work initially describes the CSRR behavior embedded in the stripline ground plane. In successive sections afterwards, different devices will be proposed, starting with power dividers and followed by the resonator, multi-frequency resonators, diplexers and filter design.\n2. Stripline Loaded with Complementary Split Ring Resonators\nIn Figure 1, the electric and magnetic fields distributions are plotted within a stripline transmission line configuration. As can be seen, a TEM mode between the input line and ground planes is excited (i.e., the E-field is axial to the ground plane). It is well known that CSRRs are excited by an electric field axial to the ring [27]. Considering this fact, the TEM mode of the stripline provides a proper excitation mode, as was already demonstrated by embedding the CSRR in the input line of a stripline in [28].\nMicromachines 2022, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 24 useful in the case of transmission lines such as microstrip lines.

Power Divider\nPower dividers based on SRRs were used to design power dividers in different configurations\u2014such as Wilkinson power dividers [29] and Bailey power dividers [30]\u2014 and also in substrate-integrated waveguide (SIW) structures [31]. The use of composite right-handed/left-handed has also been employed in the design of multilayer power dividers [32]. As explained in the introductory section, the field distribution in the stripline is homogenous, exciting a TEM mode along the transmission line. The main idea is to extract all the energy that reaches the ground plane to a new layer by using slot resonators etched on each ground plane. Coupling energy, through a slot, was successfully implemented and reported in [33]. The use of this concept to design power dividers has also been developed and reported in [34,35]. In this work, to achieve coupling to a different layer, a square complementary split ring resonator will be used. As shown in Figure 1, the E-field lines in the stripline expand from the input metallization to the ground planes. The SCSRR will be placed symmetrically on each metallization layer. The axial electric field will be used to excite each SCSRR [12]. In the schematic layout, we can see that a central metallization line acts as the input of a stripline. The ground planes of the stripline are the location for the embedded SCSRRs. These metallization layers also act as the ground plane for the microstrip line built for outputs: one on top of the device and the other one in the bottom layer.

Filters\nIn the last section of this work, a device acting as a filter is described. The design of filters with SRR and CSRR in planar technologies has been widely studied [13,49]. The use of couples of CSRRs for building resonators was analyz d in detail for microstrip and coplanar transmission lines [50]. The use of pairs of CSRRs in different combinations was proposed in an SIW transmission line [32] to design filters, along with the use of stripline as a transmission line to build multi-layer filters [51]. For the design proposed in this work, the face-to-face layout is chosen. The input and output lines are placed in a serial configuration. Both are in the same metallization lay r. The top layout is shown in Figure 25a. The main advantage in the device presented is that the second pair of CSRRs is placed just above the first one. The effective area needed to obtain similar results is reduced by more than 60%. The dimensions of the rings in the lower ground plane are the same as those in previous devices. In this case, the separation of SCSRRs is sep = 0.6 mm. The main difference in this case is that the dimensions of the rings on the top ground plane are scaled by a factor of 1.02 on both dimensions x and z. A zoom with a detailed view is provided in Figure 25b. The distance from the border of the first SCSRR to the end of the output line is p1 = 0.55 mm. The distance from the end of the output line to the border of the SCSRR is defined as p2 = 0.7 mm. The equivalent circuit of the previous device is represented in Figure 26. The input line is represented with the per unit length inductance Lstrip. The input line is cut just when reaching the resonators. This is emulated, as previously stated, with open stubs: one to the top ring and another one to the bottom ring\u2014both with the same value Lin. The coupling between the input line and resonators is modelled by Cin. In this circuit, as resonators on different layers have different dimensions, they have been named with different labels. The rings in the bottom layer are characterized with the LC tank, labeled LSCSRRD and CSCSRRD. The LC components for the resonators on the top layer are labeled as LSCSRRT and CSCSRRT. The coupling between the resonators and the ground plane is depicted as Cgnd. The coupling between the resonators in the same layer as Cc2 and the last coupling effect are the coupling between the rings on different layers, which is characterized as Ccoup. The output components are pretty similar to the input ones. In this case, the coupling between the resonators and output line is modeled with Cout. The distance by which the output line overlaps the rings is again emulated as open stubs, represented as Lout, and, finally, the output line is represented as the input one, like Lstrip.\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1190 19 of 23\nMicromachines 2022, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 19 of 24\nsame as those in previous devices.

The insertion loss S21 = 1.01 dB, the central frequency f0 = 5.920 GHz, and the BW at \u22123 dB is 270 MHz.\n8. Summary\nAs a summary for this article, in Table 1, the characteristics of the different configurations presented in this work are presented.\nIn relation to the effective area calculation, the ring dimensions plus an additional distance of 3 mm on each side have been considered. In the filter device, the center of the passband is chosen to calculate \u03bbg. On the multi-frequency resonators and duplexer, with two resonant frequencies each, the higher frequency is chosen to provide the least favorable result. Finally, in Table 2, the differentiating results and the other device-specific parameters, such as the unloaded quality factor (Qu) for resonators, are enumerated.\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1190 21 of 23\nStripline transmission lines are suitable to excite Complementary Split Ring Resonators placed on the ground plane due to the dominant TEM propagating mode. Starting with this assumption, different devices in multilayer structures are presented. A high performance in miniaturized devices is obtained, such as in power dividers, duplexers resonators, and filters. As the resonators are designed in stacked configurations, the effective size of the device is decremented. The stacked configuration also provides flexibility in the design, as, in some of the proposed devices, the output line can be placed in different layers with the same response. The proposed devices therefore exhibit the following properties, which can aid in the design of more compact and flexible devices: (i) they employ a stacked configuration, taking advantage of a volumetric configuration instead of increasing the circuit footprint in a configuration that is amenable with chip housings; (ii) the structure is fully planar and compatible with planar transmission lines; (iii) the proposed devices can have outputs in different facets, enabling a more flexible routing of connections in transceiver systems. An analytical model is presented for each device, considering the effect of coupling between which different resonances excite. These, in turn, can be advantageously used to implement multi-frequency resonators and filters. As future work, measurement validations of the final design should be performed. The CSRR elements in different planar transmission line configurations have been validated in measurements (including multi-stack SIW-based configurations), showing a good agreement with the design parameters and simulation results. The current limitations within our lab in terms of probe connections and fixtures, as well as the potential expansion towards tunable frequency response devices aided by active circuit inclusion or the use of variable \u03b5 or \u00b5 substrates and materials (e.g., liquid crystal or ferromagnetic substrates), are future work lines to be developed.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, E.J. and F.F.; methodology, E.J.; software, E.J.; validation, E.J. and F.F.; formal analysis, E.J.; investigation, E.J.; resources, E.J. and F.F.; data curation, E.J.; writing\u2014 original draft preparation, E.J.; writing\u2014review and editing, E.J.; visualization, E.J.; supervision, F.F.; project administration, F.F.; funding acquisition, F.F.
