1. **Investigate the synergistic effects of different Hibiscus phenolic compounds on obesity and related disorders.** This could be done by combining different phenolic compounds in vitro and in vivo models to assess their combined effects on weight loss, lipid metabolism, and inflammation.
2. **Explore the mechanisms by which Hibiscus phenolic compounds modulate gut microbiota composition and function.** This could be done by using metagenomic sequencing and other techniques to identify the specific bacteria that are affected by Hibiscus phenolic compounds and to determine how these changes affect overall gut health.
3. **Develop novel delivery systems for Hibiscus phenolic compounds to improve their bioavailability and bioaccessibility.** This could involve encapsulating the compounds in nanoparticles or other delivery systems that can protect them from degradation in the gastrointestinal tract.
4. **Investigate the long-term effects of Hibiscus phenolic compounds on obesity and related disorders.** This could be done by conducting clinical trials to assess the safety and efficacy of Hibiscus phenolic compounds over a period of several months or years.
5. **Identify the specific phenolic compounds in Hibiscus that are responsible for its bioactivity.** This could be done by isolating and testing individual phenolic compounds in vitro and in vivo models to determine their specific effects on obesity and related disorders.
