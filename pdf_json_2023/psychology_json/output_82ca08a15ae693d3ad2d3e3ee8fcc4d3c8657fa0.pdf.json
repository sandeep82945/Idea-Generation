There is a need to identify agents that can augment the effectiveness of chemotherapy.\nNarasin is a polyether ionophonic antibiotic isolated from Streptomyces albus, is widely used to treat coccidiosis and bacterial infection in poultry [5]. Narasin is a derivative of salinomycin and shares similar structure with monensin [6]. Both salinomycin and monensin are polyether ionophonic, and are found to have potent anticancer activities in a variety of cancers [7]. In particular, apart from differentiated bulk tumor cells, salinomycin targets cancer stem cells and tumor-initiating population to suppress tumorigenicity and reverse treatment"

However, whether narasin is active against cancer remains largely unknown with only two relevant studies. One recent study demonstrates that narasin inhibits tumor metastasis and growth of ER\u03b1positive breast cancer cells, and this is through inactivation of the TGF-\u03b2/SMAD3 and IL-6/STAT3 signaling pathways [11]. Another reveals that narasin stimulates tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-induced ligand (TRAIL)-mediated apoptosis in glioma cells via endoplasmic reticulum stress, CHOP-mediated DR5 upregulation and c-FLIP downregulation [12].\nUsing both cellular and mouse models, we systematically investigated the efficacy of narasin alone, and its combination with doxorubicin, in osteosarcoma, and attempted to reveal the underlying mechanism of narasin\u2019s activity. We found that narasin alone is effective and selective in inhibiting osteosarcoma cells, and acts synergistically with doxorubicin in vitro and in vivo. In addition, the inhibitory effects of narasin in osteosarcoma are attributed to its ability in inducing oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction."

            "text": "Narasin inhibits growth and survival in osteosarcoma cells and is less toxic to normal cells We examined the effect of narasin on osteosarcoma cell growth and survival. We exposed two osteosarcoma cell lines for 72\u00a0 h, followed by performing proliferation and apoptosis assays. Narasin at 5, 10, 20 and 40 \u00b5M decreased proliferation by 65%, 78%, 92% and 96% in Saos-2 cells, and 39%, 49%, 73% and 98% in HOS cells (Fig.\u00a01A). In contrast, narasin at 5, 10, 20 and 40 \u00b5M decreased proliferation by 9%, 21%, 22% and 46% in normal fibroblast BJ-5ta cells. In addition, narasin at 5 \u00b5M did not affect osteosarcoma nor normal fibroblast cell apoptosis (Fig.\u00a01B). Narasin at 10, 20 and 40 \u00b5M increased apoptosis by 17%, 44% and 63% in Saos-2 cells, 12%, 35% and 63% in HOS cells, and 6%, 20% and 39% in human normal primary osteoblast cells. These results indicate that narasin at low micromolar concentrations is effective in inhibiting growth and inducing apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells, and furthermore that narasin is less toxic to normal cells.\nNarasin significantly enhances in vitro efficacy of doxorubicin in osteosarcoma cells We next examined the combinatory effect of narasin with chemotherapy on osteosarcoma cells. Doxorubicin, one of the most active chemotherapeutic drugs\nused in osteosarcoma [13], was used in our combination studies. Concentration of each drug was determined based on our preliminary data that single drug alone treatment leads to < 50% growth inhibition and < 40% apoptosis induction. We found that narasin and doxorubicin alone inhibited growth by 36% and 45% in Saos-2 cells; 39% and 48% in HOS cells (Fig.\u00a0 2A and B). The combination inhibited growth by 95% in Saos-2 and 80% in HOS. Narasin and doxorubicin alone induced apoptosis by 20% and 38% in Saos-2 cells; 35% and 32% in HOS cells (Fig.\u00a02C and D). The combination inhibited growth by 84% in Saos-2 and 90% in HOS. Combination studies using other chemotherapeutic agents demonstrated that the combined treatment of narasin with either methotrexate or cisplatin led to a more pronounced inhibitory impact on the growth of Saos-2 and HOS cells (Figure S1). These results indicate that narasin significantly enhances in vitro efficacy of chemotherapy in osteosarcoma cells.\nNarasin induces oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction in osteosarcoma cells Our mechanism studies showed that narasin significantly increased ROS level in Saos-2 and HOS cells in a concentration-dependent manner (Fig.\u00a03A). Western blot analysis of \u03b3-H2AX, a core histone protein that is phosphorylated in response to DNA damage, was\nincreased (Fig.\u00a03B), suggesting oxidative DNA damage in osteosarcoma cells after narasin treatment. Consistently, protein carbonyls, a modification of proteins resulting from oxidative damage, was increased in narasin-treated cells (Fig.\u00a0 3C). Malondialdehyde (MDA), an indicated of lipid peroxidation, was also increased (Fig.\u00a0 3D). These results indicate that narasin induces oxidative stress and damage in osteosarcoma cells.\nConsistent with the fact that mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the consequences of excessive ROS accumulation [14], we found that narasin significantly decreased mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP level in Saos-2 and HOS cells (Fig.\u00a04A and B). Basal OCR, which was measured under basal condition and indicates basal mitochondrial respiration, and maximal OCR which was measured after FCCP stimulation and indicates spare respiratory capacity, were determined in cells after narasin treatment. We observed a concentration-dependent reduction in both basal and maximal mitochondrial respiration in narasin-treated cells (Fig.\u00a04C and D). Narasin-induced mitochondrial dysfunction, growth arrest and apoptosis were rescued by an antioxidant in osteosarcoma cells To investigate whether oxidative stress is required for narasin\u2019s action in osteosarcoma cells, we performed rescue studies using an antioxidant. Osteosarcoma cells were pre-treated with NAC for 2\u00a0h, followed by narasin treatment. We found that NAC pre-treatment restored mitochondrial membrane potential of narasin-treated osteosarcoma cells to almost control levels (Fig.\u00a0 5A). In addition, NAC significantly reversed the inhibitory effects of narasin in decreasing basal and maximal mitochondrial respiration (Fig.\u00a0 5B and C). A significant less \u03b3-H2AX level was observed in NAC pre-treated cells in the presence of narasin compared to narasin treatment alone (Fig.\u00a0 5D). Of note, NAC almost completely abolished the anti-proliferative and pro-apoptotic effects of narasin (Fig.\u00a06).\nNarasin significantly enhances in vitro efficacy of doxorubicin in osteosarcoma cells To determine whether the in vitro findings are reproducible in in vivo, we applied osteosarcoma mouse model via subcutaneous injection of Saos-2 cell/Matrigel mixture into mice. After development of palpable tumors, mice were treated with vehicle, narasin, doxorubicin alone, and the combination of narasin and doxorubicin. We assessed the general toxicity in mice subjected to drug treatment by gauging changes in body weight and scrutinizing for any deviations from the norm in physical attributes (such as fur-coat condition and edema) as well as behaviors (like vocalization, hunched posture, and shivering). We monitored tumor size (to indicate tumor growth) during the whole treatment duration. The dose of narasin employed in the combination study represented the highest concentration that did not induce toxicity in mice. This selection was based on the absence of substantial body weight reduction (Fig.\u00a07A) or the manifestation of any anomalous physical appearances or behaviors. After 3 weeks treatment, we demonstrated that narasin slightly decreased tumor size whereas doxorubicin moderately decreased tumor size (Fig.\u00a07B). Consistent with the in vitro finding on the synergism between narasin and doxorubicin, the combination of narasin and doxorubicin led to significant less tumor size than single drug alone. Approximately complete inhibition of tumor growth was observed throughout the whole duration of treatment in combination group. IHC staining revealed a heightened presence of apoptotic cells in tumors derived from mice subjected to combination treatment, as compared to those receiving treatment with a single drug (Fig.\u00a07C)."

            "text": "This study provides evidence to demonstrate that (1) narasin alone is active and selective in targeting osteosarcoma cells; (2) narasin remarkably enhances in vitro and in vivo efficacy of doxorubicin; (3) treatment of narasin and doxorubicin combination is not toxic in mice; (4) narasin acts on osteosarcoma cells through inducing oxidative stress. Since osteosarcoma has complex multigenomic heterogeneity and its progression is associated with the genetic variations and instabilities [15], targeting common factor (e.g., redox homeostasis) may has advantage than specific gene or signaling pathways.\nAlthough narasin is a polyether ionophonic antibiotic, we found that narasin at low micromolar concentrations that inhibits growth and induces apoptosis in osteosarcoma cells while is less toxic to normal fibroblast cells (Fig.\u00a01). This finding is consistent with the previous report on the anti-proliferative and antisurvival effects of narasin in breast cancer [11]. In addition, narasin significantly augments the inhibitory\neffects of doxorubicin, cisplatin and methotrexate in osteosarcoma cell growth (Fig.\u00a0 2 and Fig. S1). We are the first to reveal that narasin displays selective anti-cancer activity and acts synergistically with chemotherapy.\nThese in vitro findings are further confirmed in our in vivo studies that the combination of narasin and doxorubicin results in remarkably higher efficacy than doxorubicin alone in inhibiting osteosarcoma growth without causing significant toxicity in mice (Fig.\u00a0 7). Substantial evidence shows that salinomycin selectively targets the cancer stem cells and tumor-initiating cells [9, 16, 17]. As being a derivate of salinomycin, narasin is likely to exert anti-cancer activities through targeting cancer stem cells or tumor-initiating cells. Tumor formation assay and anchorage-independent colony formation assay should be applied in the future to examine the effects of narasin on osteosarcoma stem cells and initiating cells. The validation of combinatory effects of narasin with cisplatin and methotrexate using in vivo osteosarcoma models should be conducted to confirm the synergy between narasin and chemotherapeutic agents. The combination therapy\nelucidated in our study might not be universally applicable across all grades and variants of osteosarcoma. Rather, our preclinical discoveries establish a proof-ofconcept, showcasing the potential of combining narasin with chemotherapy for osteosarcoma treatment. To substantiate the combined efficacy and safety, clinical trials are imperative. We posit that initial recruitment for these clinical investigations should prioritize patients with advanced osteosarcoma stages, particularly those demonstrating elevated levels of mitochondrial biogenesis.\nNarasin inhibits TGF-\u03b2/SMAD3 and IL-6/STAT3 activation in breast cancer cells [11]. Our mechanism studies show that narasin induces oxidative DNA, protein and lipid damage in osteosarcoma cells. As a consequence of oxidative and mitochondrial dysfunction (Figs.\u00a0 3 and 4). Antioxidant reverses the inhibitory effects of narasin (Figs.\u00a05 and 6). All these indicate that oxidative stress induction contributes to narasin\u2019s effects in osteosarcoma cells. Oxidative stress has garnered attention in osteosarcoma as therapies targeting oxidative stress selectively eliminate cancer cells [18, 19]. Although high level of ROS has been detected in\nmany cancers which promotes cancer growth and survival, many agents that lead to excessive ROS induce cancer cell death [20, 21]. Monensin which demonstrates similar structure as narasin has been reported to inhibit anaplastic thyroid cancer and prostate cancer via inducing oxidative stress [22\u201324]. Our work and others suggest that oxidative stress might be the target of polyether ionophonic antibiotic in cancer cells.\nSimilar to osteosarcoma cells, we observed a significant rise in intracellular ROS and \u03b3-H2AX levels induced by narasin treatment in osteoblast cells as well (Figure S2A and B). In addition, narasin treatment in osteoblast cells resulted in a substantial reduction in basal and maximal OCR levels (Figure S2C and D). Interestingly, we noted that basal ROS and OCR levels are significantly lower in osteoblast cells compared to Saos-2 and HOS (Figure S3A and B). This is consistent with Chen et al\u2019s work that osteoblast cells display decreased mitochondrial biogenesis and baseline oxygen consumption compared to osteosarcoma cells [25]. We also noted that osteoblast cells exhibited a lower ROS level in comparison to osteosarcoma cells (Figure S3C). Eleni et al. reported that ROSlow leukemia cells are dependent on oxidative respiration rather than glycolysis for energy generation than ROShigh leukemia cells [26]. Hence, we posit that the heightened susceptibility of osteosarcoma cells to narasin, relative to osteoblast cells, could be attributed to osteosarcoma cells exhibiting a greater dependence on mitochondrial functionality, in contrast to osteoblast cells. This speculation is supported by previous research on the heightened metabolic activity and reliance on mitochondrial function in tumor cells in comparison to their nonmalignant counterparts [27]. AMPK activity responds to ATP levels and hence provides a direct and gauge of cellular energy status [28]. AMPK activation will inhibit the mammalian/mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling which regulates mitochondrial mass and functions [29]. We speculate that mTOR and AMPK pathways might be involved in the downstream of narasin\u2019s action.\nIn conclusion, our study demonstrates the potential of narasin to augment doxorubicin\u2019s efficacy in preclinical osteosarcoma models and highlights the therapeutic value of targeting oxidative stress in osteosarcoma.\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https://doi. org/10.1186/s40360-023-00695-6.\nSupplementary Material 1\nAcknowledgements Not applicable.\nAuthor contributions JJG and PW designed and supervised the study, JJG, ZMH and JGY conducted the experiments, JJG, ZHM, JGY, FB and PW analyzed and interpreted the data, PW prepared the manuscript, JJG and ZHM revised the manuscript.
