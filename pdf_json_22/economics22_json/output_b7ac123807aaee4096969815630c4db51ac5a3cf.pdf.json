    "abstractText": "Context: Chronic diseases are growing in India and largely affecting the middle-aged and elderly population; many of them are in working age. Though a large number of studies estimated the out-of-pocket payment and financial catastrophe due to this condition, there are no nationally representative studies on productivity loss due to health problems. This paper examined the pattern and prevalence of productivity loss, due to chronic diseases among middle-aged and elderly in India. Methods: We have used a total of 72,250 respondents from the first wave of Longitudinal Ageing Study in India (LASI), conducted in 2017-18. We have used two dependent variables, limiting paid work and ever stopped work due to ill health. We have estimated the age-sex adjusted prevalence of ever stopped working due to ill health and limiting paid work across MPCE quintile and sociodemographic characteristics. Propensity Score Matching (PSM) and logistic regression was used to examine the effect of chronic diseases on both these variables. Findings: We estimated that among middle aged adults in 45\u201364 years, 3,213 individuals accounting to 6.9% (95%CI:6.46\u20137.24) had ever-stopped work and 6,300 individuals accounting to 22.7% (95% CI: 21.49\u201323.95) had limiting paid work in India. The proportion of ever-stopped and limiting work due to health problem increased significantly with age and the number of chronic diseases. Limiting paid work is higher among females (25.1%), and in urban areas (24%) whereas ever-stopped is lower among female (5.7%) (95% CI:5.16\u20136.25 ) and in urban areas (4.9%) (95% CI: 4.20\u20135.69). The study also found that stroke (21.1%) and neurological or psychiatric problems (18%) were significantly associated with both ever stopped work and limiting paid work. PSM model shows that, those with chronic diseases are 4% and 11% more likely to stop and limit their work respectively. Regression model reveals that more than one chronic conditions had a consistent and significant positive impact on stopping work for over a year (increasing productivity loss) across all three models. Conclusion: Individuals having any chronic disease has higher likelihood of ever stopped work and limiting paid work. Promoting awareness, screening and treatment at workplace is recommended to reduce adverse consequences of chronic disease in India.",

We have used two dependent variables, limiting paid work and ever stopped work due to ill health. We have estimated the age-sex adjusted prevalence of ever stopped working due to ill health and limiting paid work across MPCE quintile and socio- demographic characteristics. Propensity Score Matching (PSM) and logistic regression was used to examine the effect of chronic diseases on both these variables.\nFindings: We estimated that among middle aged adults in 45\u201364 years, 3,213 individuals accounting to 6.9% (95%CI:6.46\u20137.24) had ever-stopped work and 6,300 individuals accounting to 22.7% (95% CI: 21.49\u201323.95) had limiting paid work in India. The proportion of ever-stopped and limiting work due to health problem increased significantly with age and the number of chronic diseases. Limiting paid work is higher among females (25.1%), and in urban areas (24%) whereas ever-stopped is lower among female (5.7%) (95% CI:5.16\u20136.25 ) and in urban areas (4.9%) (95% CI: 4.20\u20135.69). The study also found that stroke (21.1%) and neurological or psychiatric problems (18%) were significantly associated with both ever stopped work and limiting paid work. PSM model shows that, those with chronic diseases are 4% and 11% more likely to stop and limit their work respectively. Regression model reveals that more than one chronic conditions had a consistent and significant positive impact on stopping work for over a year (increasing productivity loss) across all three models.\nConclusion: Individuals having any chronic disease has higher likelihood of ever stopped work and limiting paid work. Promoting awareness, screening and treatment at workplace is recommended to reduce adverse consequences of chronic disease in India.\nKeywords: Chronic diseases, Ever-stopped work, Limiting paid work, Elderly, Middle-aged, Productivity loss, India"

The high *Correspondence: ishamrinakhtar@gmail.com 1 International Institute for Population Sciences, Mumbai, Maharashtra 400088, India Full list of author information is available at the end of the article\nout-of-pocket spending, catastrophic health spending and impoverishment are direct consequences of increasing chronic diseases [4]. Indirect burden of chronic diseases includes work absenteeism, voluntary retirement from work [5], and reduced propensity to work [6]. The cascading effect of ill-health reduces individual income [7] and may lead to poor physical and mental health [8] and may lead to gradual loss of productivity and welfare.\nProductivity loss reduces the income and well-being of individuals and households. Ill-health often reduces the work participation as it affects the prime working age group. Productive time forgone due to ill-health cost both, to the household and the nation as well. Productivity loss is measured using multiple indicators; work absenteeism, presenteeism, permanent withdrawal from the workforce, and job interruption [9]. While work absenteeism refers to absence due to illness, presenteeism is low work performance during sickness [10]. Permanent withdrawal from the workforce includes voluntary retirement due to impairment or other health problems. Work-related injuries or accidents and success and failure also add to productivity loss [11].\nMost of the studies on the consequences of chronic diseases on work productivity were carried out in developed countries [12\u201314]. People with poor health are more likely to spend a considerable time in seeking healthcare and that may lead to work absenteeism [15]. Among respondents who experienced symptoms related to health conditions in Germany, the average number of workdays lost due to absenteeism and presenteeism was 27 days per respondent annually [16]. Results from a study in Australia shows that the full-time workers with mental disorders lost an average of one day due to absenteeism and three days due to presenteeism in one month reference period [17]. In USA, the weekly absenteeism costs US$1685/employee per year and about 71% of the total productivity loss was contributed by reduced performance at work [18]. Asthma, cancer, heart disease, and respiratory disorders were estimated to have presenteeism costs of more than US$200 per person annually in USA [19]. Presenteeism represents the largest component and leading driver to the medical costs, specifically among the patients with migraine/headache, allergies, and arthritis [20]. Depression ranked third among health conditions with an annual productivity loss of US$878 per person [21]. A higher number of health risks is associated with lower on-the-job productivity [22]. Adults with multiple chronic diseases may have high chance of reduced productivity [23] In India, nearly a quarter of the companies lose approximately 14% of the total working days annually due to sickness [24].\nOlder adults in India are vulnerable to chronic diseases and, that may affect their work temporary or permanently [25]. The country has achieved the replacement level of fertility and nearing completion of demographic transition, resulting increasing share of older adults and elderly in the country and increasing burden of noncommunicable disease (NCD). The share of middle aged and elderly population (45+) has increased from 18.9% to 2001 to 25.1% by 2020 [26]. The median age of onset of NCDs was also declining from 57 years in 2004 to 53 years by 2018 [27]. Though large number of studies estimated the OOP and catastrophic health spending, socioeconomic inequality and determinant of OOPS and CHE [28], there is no nationally representative studies on productivity loss due to health problems. Present study explores the pattern and prevalence of limiting paid work and productivity loss among middle-aged and elderly in India and their association with chronic diseases. Figure\u00a0 1 presents a schematic presentation of productivity loss. It depicts the pathways how economic burden of ill-health lead to loss of income and welfare through various medical and non-medical components. The nonmedical component includes absenteeism, presenteeism and job-interruption."

PSM is a statistical technique that estimates the effect of an intervention or a treatment by adjusting for covariates that predicts the results of receiving the treatment [30]. The advantage of using PSM model is that it compares the treated and controlled group on the basis of similar observed characteristics [31, 32]. The PSM has been used for evaluating various programme in a number of research studies [31\u201334].

Those who were not working currently, about 31.5% have had stopped work, out of which health related reason accounts 56.5% followed by 20% due to childcare.\nTable\u00a01 presents the socio-economic and demographic profile of the study samples of ever worked and currently working/ temporarily laid off. Of the total surveyed individuals, 59.3% had ever worked and 40.7% were currently working/temporarily laid off. Over 67.52% of ever worked sample population were in the working age group (under 65) compared to 81.03% for currently working sample. The sample was predominantly rural and currently married.

            "text": "This is the first ever population-based study that estimated the prevalence of ever stopped work and limiting paid work among middle aged and elderly in India. The key strength of our study is the use of the first and latest data from a high-quality, nationally representative, population-based ageing survey in India. Our study included sample of the middle-aged population, as well as the elderly population who have ever worked. This study fills the critical gaps in knowledge by investigating pattern and prevalence of limiting paid work and productivity loss among middle-aged and elderly in India and their association with chronic diseases and the validity of these findings has been confirmed by employing the robustness checks.\nThe results of age-sex adjusted estimates of ever stopped work and limiting work suggest that 7% of older adults ever stopped working and 23% had limiting work due to health-related issues. The prevalence of everstopped working and limiting work due to ill health is\nhigher among those with a chronic condition compared to those who do not have that across socio-economic characteristics. As expected, the prevalence of everstopped work and limiting paid work are higher among the people who have even a single disease than who doesn\u2019t and positively associated with age. The results of propensity score matching show that the difference in ATE is 4.8% and 12% which indicates after matching, the population with chronic disease are 4.8% and 12% more likely to stop working. Moreover, the prevalence of ever stopped work was higher among those in working age group compared to elderly (65+). However, the probability of limiting paid work was higher among elderly compared to working age group. Controlling for sociodemographic and economic factors, the probability for ever stopped work was lower among females but higher among rural dwellers. The probability of limiting paid work was higher among females, rural dwellers and people who had health insurance, also this was high among people belonging to comparatively higher MPCE groups. These findings are consistent with literature from lowand middle-income countries [35]. Second, we found educational attainment as significant predictors of ever stopped work and limiting paid work. In the case of full model (model 3) a significant decrease in stopping work and limiting paid work was observed with higher level of education. Zimmerman et\u00a0 al. addressed this and investigated that, those adults with relatively higher educational level are expected to have greater socio-economic resources to attain a healthy lifestyle, also they are well equipped with the health literacy level required to avail later in their lives [36].\nWe found each of the chronic disease are significantly associated with stopping work and limiting paid work.

Many stroke survivors experience poststroke spasticity resulting in inability to perform daily activities, further necessitating their management and treatment. This exerts a considerable economic burden due to treatment cost and lost productive days [37]. Results from a study also indicate that inability to complete neuropsychological tests at one-year post-injury is associated with non-productive activity [38]. The chance of ever stopped work by each of the chronic diseases was higher among adults in the prime working age group suggesting that chronic diseases significantly inhibit the work. Even after adjusting for other socioeconomic and demographic characteristics, number of chronic diseases is found to be important contextual unit for everstopped work and limiting paid work.\nAs per World global health (WHO) fact on non-communicable diseases 2021 showed that, 71% of all deaths caused by non-communicable each year 15\u00a0million people in age group 30 to 69 dies due to NCDs and 85% of them belong to low- and middle-income countries and 77% of all NCDs death takes place in low- and middleincome countries. Chronic disease does not only hinder individual productivity and wellbeing but also it brings economic and human working hours capital loss for the nation. The increased burden of chronic diseases among working population in low-income and middleincome countries that have inadequate health systems\nmight increase the productivity loss and global inequality and instability.\nOccurrence of chronic diseases among the working age group is expected to increase along with increasing share of elderly population in India [39]. Chronic disease poses greater risk of high medical expenditure and productivity loss at work for the working population. Our study reflects the very same notion. Evidences from this study on chronic diseases and productivity loss in India is new and staggering, with a demand of policy attention. At present, there is no official programme focusing on work place and chronic diseases in India. The first step in this direction is to create awareness followed by screening for growing non-communicable diseases, at least for employee working in public and private sectors to optimise the productivity potential. The burden of ill-health in terms of productivity loss will further increase if no programs are implemented to manage, control, or prevent chronic diseases among working middle-aged and elderly population in India. There need to be an investment in carefully designing workplace intervention by the policymakers and employers at population and individual level to turn away the adverse economic and health consequences of chronic diseases.\nWe acknowledge the following limitations of this study. First, the chronic diseases we used are self-reported and medically diagnosed. We believe that a higher proportion of population with chronic diseases has not remain undiagnosed. Second, we did not analysed by actual loss of\n\u00ae indicates reference category\u00a0\n* p < 0.05, values in the parentheses are 95% confidence interval\nTable 5 (continued)\nUnadjusted Adjusted\nModel 1 Model 2 Model 3\nOR 95% CI OR 95% CI OR 95% CI"
