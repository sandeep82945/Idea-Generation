    "abstractText": "Cryptococcus neoformans is the pathogen responsible for cryptococcal pneumonia and meningitis, mainly affecting patients with suppressed immune systems. We have previously revealed the mechanism of anticryptococcal action of synthetic antimicrobial peptides (SAMPs). In this study, computational and experimental analyses provide new insights into the mechanisms of action of SAMPs. Computational analysis revealed that peptides interacted with the PHO36 membrane receptor of C. neoformans. Additionally, ROS (reactive oxygen species) overproduction, the enzymes of ROS metabolism, interference in the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway, and decoupling of cytochrome c mitochondrial membrane were evaluated. Three of four peptides were able to interact with the PHO36 receptor, altering its function and leading to ROS overproduction. SAMPs-treated C. neoformans cells showed a decrease in scavenger enzyme activity, supporting ROS accumulation. In the presence of ascorbic acid, an antioxidant agent, SAMPs did not induce ROS accumulation in C. neoformans cells. Interestingly, two SAMPs maintained inhibitory activity and membrane pore formation in C. neoformans cells by a ROS-independent mechanism. Yet, the ergosterol biosynthesis and lactate dehydrogenase activity were affected by SAMPs. In addition, we noticed decoupling of Cyt c from the mitochondria, which led to apoptosis events in the cryptococcal cells. The results presented herein suggest multiple mechanisms imposed by SAMPs against C. neoformans interfering in the development of resistance, thus revealing the potential of SAMPs in treating infections caused by C. neoformans.",

            "text": "Currently, treatments against bacterial and fungal infections are limited due to the development of resistance to drugs by pathogens [1]. C. neoformans is a good example of a multidrug-resistant pathogen that causes dangerous infections worldwide [2]. Cryptococcosis and cryptococcal meningitis caused by C. neoformans mainly affect people with compromised immune systems. It is estimated 278,000 infections occur yearly in HIVpositive patients worldwide, leading to 181,000 deaths annually [3].\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, 153. https://doi.org/10.3390/antibiotics12010153 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/antibiotics\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, 153 2 of 17\nThe high level of resistance presented by C. neoformans narrows down the number of drugs that can be used in treatments. For example, C. neoformans presents intrinsic resistance to caspofungin, which inhibits the enzyme (1\u21923)-\u03b2-D-glucan synthase and, nevertheless, perturbs the turnover of the fungal cell wall [1,3,4]. Therefore, combined treatment of amphotericin B (AmB) and flucytosine (FC) are commonly used to treat cryptococcosis infections [4]. However, prolonged exposure results in the emergence of cryptococcal populations resistant to this treatment, as well as to the toxicity of those drugs [5]. To cope with this problem imposed by C. neoformans, SAMPs have emerged as promising alternative molecules due to their mechanism of action, which is generally associated with membrane pore formation. This mechanism makes it difficult for microorganisms to acquire resistance, low toxicity, and allergenicity [6\u20138]. Recently, our research group reported the anti-cryptococcal potential of SAMPs PepGAT, PepKAA, RcAlb-PepII, and RcAlb-PepIII [7]. Studies on mechanisms of action revealed that SAMPs prompted membrane pore formation and apoptosis induced by DNA degradation in C. neoformans cells [7]. In this study, an in silico and in vitro approach provided new insight into the mechanism of action of SAMPs (PepGAT, PepKAA, RcAlb-PepII, and RcAlb-PepIII) against C. neoformans. In silico analysis revealed that three SAMPs bind to the PHO36 receptor of C. neoformans, inducing conformational alteration. In vitro analysis showed a high accumulation of ROSs in C. neoformans treated with SAMPs. In further experiments, it was determined that peptides cause a disbalance in redox enzymes and lactate dehydrogenase activity in C. neoformans cells. Additionally, SAMPs induced the decoupling of cytochrome c from the mitochondrion and inhibited ergosterol biosynthesis. Together, these findings strengthen the need for employment of these SAMPs against C. neoformans infections."

As C. neoformans is resistant to several drugs used in its treatment, it becomes essential to search for bioactive molecules as an alternative to conventional treatment [9,10]. This study was developed based on this emergence to find new molecules in order to overcome the resistance of C. neoformans to drugs. Herein, we provide new mechanisms behind the activity of four synthetic peptides against C. neoformans. Our SAMPs demonstrated inhibitory activity (MIC50) in a previous study at low concentrations [7]. The mechanisms evaluated at that time were pore formation, DNA damage, apoptosis induction, and damage caused by peptides to the cell wall and pores in the membrane [7]. Based on previously published results regarding DNA damage and apoptosis induction, we began the analysis by evaluating the redox metabolism in C. neoformans cells after contact with peptides (Figures 1\u20133). The induction of ROS overaccumulation in microorganisms by peptides was not a surprise, but it could explain how SAMPs act against C. neoformans [11\u201314]. In pathogenic fungi with controlled production, ROSs have many beneficial effects on pathogens, such as developmental process, increased virulence, biofilm formation, and infection [15]. On the other hand, ROSs are a byproduct of the natural metabolic process in cells. Without a proper scavenger system to balance their levels, ROSs could bring damage to cells by interaction with vital molecules such as DNA, lipids, and protein, leading to death [15]. Usually, H2O2 is the main molecule analyzed in experiments of ROS accumulation induced by peptides in cells because it is more stable and easy to evaluate [11\u201313]. Here, to better picture the redox state in C. neoformans cells, we analyzed the accumulation of \u2022O2\u2212 (Figure 1), which is one of the most unstable ROSs and is rapidly converted into H2O2 [15]. Our results revealed a higher accumulation of \u2022O2\u2212 in C. neoformans cells after treatment with peptides (Figure 1). Uncontrolled accumulation of \u2022O2\u2212 accelerates the oxidative damage to DNA molecules caused by iron. The \u2022O2\u2212 induces an increase in iron levels by releasing it from proteins and enzyme clusters. The free iron interacts with DNA molecules, oxidizing it and leading to fragmentation [16]. This result is in accordance with our previously published result that C. neoformans cells presented fragmented DNA after treatment with the same synthetic peptides [7]. To prevent the damage caused by \u2022O2\u2212, cells use the SOD enzyme to produce H2O2, which is more stable than \u2022O2\u2212, but still lethal [15]. Our results revealed a high accumulation of H2O2 in C. neoformans cells after incubation with peptides (Figure 2). Although H2O2 induces damage to DNA molecules, as does \u2022O2\u2212, it usually has other targets, such as proteins and lipids. In the case of lipids, H2O2 causes the oxidation of lipids in the membrane by a process known as lipid peroxidation. This process could lead to membrane destabilization and, consequently, pore formation, increasing membrane permeability [17,18]. In addition, H2O2 also interacts with proteins, damaging them and inhibiting their activity [19]. Recently, Branco et al. [19], using a proteomic approach, revealed that Klebsiella pneumoniae cells treated with a synthetic peptide presented a high accumulation of H2O2, followed by an increase in the accumulation of proteins involved in the recovery of proteins damaged by ROS. This result suggests that the higher levels of H2O2 are involved with protein damage, in agreement with our hypothesis. It is clear that synthetic peptides cause a perturbation in redox homeostasis of \u2022O2\u2212 and H2O2 (Figures 1 and 2). However, more information about how peptides accomplish this is necessary. Based on this, the activity of scavenger enzymes was evaluated in C. neoformans cells. The enzymes evaluated were SOD, CAT, and APX (Figure 3). First, it is necessary to understand the role of these enzymes in ROS metabolism. SOD enzymes are\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, 153 11 of 17\ninvolved in the conversion of \u2022O2\u2212 into H2O2; CAT and APX are responsible for converting H2O2 into H2O and O2 [15]. These enzymes are responsible for the delicate balance of ROS levels that distinguishes the beneficial from the harmful effects of ROSs. As revealed in Figure 3A, SAMPs-treated C. neoformans cells presented reduced SOD activity. This reduced SOD activity is responsible for two problems: (1) the reduced activity of the SOD enzyme is responsible for low levels of conversion of \u2022O2\u2212 into H2O2, leading to accumulation of \u2022O2\u2212 (Figure 1 blue or cyan dots). (2) Low activity of SOD in C. neoformans cells treated with peptides is still associated with H2O2, even if it is at a low concentration. However, the activity of CAT and APX (Figure 3B,C), which are involved in scavenging of H2O2, is also reduced in cells treated with peptides, leading to the accumulation of H2O2 in C. neoformans cells (Figure 2 green fluorescence). Therefore, synthetic peptides, by an unknown mechanism, insult the balance between SOD (converts \u2022O2\u2212 into H2O2), CAT, and APX (H2O2 in H2O and O2), producing a scenario wherein \u2022O2\u2212 and H2O2 (Figures 1 and 2) accumulate at the same in C. neoformans cells, thus potentializing the damage caused by ROS. As far as we know, our study is the first to demonstrate ROS accumulation and propose how peptides induce it by negatively modulating the activity of redox enzymes involved in ROS metabolism. There are few studies with similar results to ours regarding redox enzymes with peptides in yeasts, and even in C. neoformans. However, Neto et al. [20] reported that MoCBP3 from Moringa oleifera seeds also caused perturbation in the redox enzymes, leading to the accumulation of ROSs. In that case, the authors only measured the accumulation of H2O2. Our data revealed that ROSs are important to the anticryptococcal activity of SAMPs. However, one question arises: Is the antimicrobial action of peptides fully or partially dependent on ROSs? An experiment with the antioxidant AsA provided new clues for the answer to this question. In the presence of 10 mM of AsA, all peptides had affected activity (Figure 4A). The most affected peptide, RcAlb-PepII, completely lost its activity. Similar results were posted by Neto et al. [20] for an anticandidal protein that had its activity reduced by 60% in the presence of AsA. Fluorescence microscopy (Figure 4B\u2013F) proved that there was no ROS accumulation in C. neoformans treated with peptides in the presence of AsA. A common mechanism of action of peptides against pathogens is the induction of pore formation on the membrane, leading to the loss of internal content and, subsequently, death [21,22]. The pore formation process depends on many aspects. It could be driven directly by the binding of peptides with lipids in the membrane or an indirect process driven by ROS species [13,15,18]. In a previous work, Aguiar et al. [7] showed that all synthetic peptides induced pore formation in C. neoformans. Here, as shown, the same peptides had activity in the absence of ROS, which was consumed by AsA. Therefore, we attempted to understand whether the ability of peptides to form pores is dependent on ROS accumulation. To do so, peptides were incubated with C. neoformans cells and AsA. After incubation, an iodide propidium uptake assay was performed. The result was quite surprising and exciting (Figure 5). The peptides RcAlb-PepII and PepGAT lost the ability to induce pore formation in C. neoformans membranes (Figure 5). For RcAlb-PepII, the result corroborates the loss of activity in the AsA (Figure 4A). The exciting results occurred with RcAlb-PepIII and PepKAA, which, even in AsA preventing ROS accumulation (Figure 4), induced pore formation in C. neoformans cells. This result suggests that the induction of pore formation by these peptides is ROS-dependent and might be driven by the direct interaction of peptides with the membrane. RcAlb-PepIII and PepKAA are cationic peptides with a net charge, respectively, of +1 and +3, and they have hydrophobic potential [8,23]. These features are important for pore formation in two ways: (1) positive charge is important to ionic interaction with the negative charge of lipid heads in the membrane, and (2) hydrophobic potential is critical for inserting peptides into the membrane\u2019s hydrophobic core [8].\nAntibiotics 2023, 12, 153 12 of 17\nIn our previous study [7], we observed that the presence of exogenous ergosterol affected the activity of peptides against C. neoformans, suggesting that peptides can bind to sterol in fungal membranes [7]. Therefore, we experimented with verifying whether peptides also inhibited ergosterol biosynthesis. In this experiment, the control was the antifungal drug ITR (Figure 6A). All peptides presented inhibition higher than ITR. ITR is an antifungal drug belonging to the azole class, whose main mechanism is to inhibit the ergosterol synthesis pathway. Our results demonstrate that peptides are more effective in inhibiting biosynthesis than ITR. Recently, the antifungal MoCBP2 protein, purified from M. oleifera seeds, could not inhibit the biosynthesis of ergosterol. New targets and different mechanisms in potential new drugs are important due to the resistance to the current antifungal [24]. All of our data suggest that synthetic peptides dysregulate the redox metabolism of C. neoformans cells. As we know, ROSs are natural byproducts of cell metabolism [15]. The energetic metabolism is essential to cell response to environmental insults because it provides energy, as NADPH and ATP are used to produce response proteins [25]. Even the regarding the importance of energetic metabolism to cells, studies reporting alterations caused by peptides in energetic metabolism are scarce. Herein, we attempted to understand whether peptides could cause perturbation in the production of energy by C. neoformans. First, the activity of the LDH enzyme in C. neoformans cells was analyzed after the treatment with peptides. All peptides dramatically reduced the activity of LDH (Figure 6B). LDH is involved in the carbohydrate metabolic pathway, and it catalyzes the conversion of pyruvate into lactate, regenerating the NAD+ from NADH [26]. This reaction is important to regenerate the NAD+ in order to maintain the glycolytic pathway, and to produce ATP and pyruvate in order to run the Krebs cycle [26]. Another experiment suggested that peptides interfere in the energetic metabolism of C. neoformans cells. The analysis of Cyt c decoupling from the mitochondrial membrane induced by peptides indicates that peptides interfere with mitochondria\u2019s energy production. Inducing the decoupling of Cyt c from mitochondrial membrane peptides causes two problems for C. neoformans cells. First, Cyt c is a key molecule in the electron transport chain (ETC) to support ATP synthesis [27]. Inducing the decoupling of Cyt c peptides to destabilize the ETC leads to a depletion in the ATP levels of the cell. Second, the release of the mitochondrial membrane by Cyt c acts as a stimulus for cells to begin apoptosis. Thus, peptides may be inducing this event. It is essential to note that all peptides induced apoptosis in C. neoformans cells, as revealed by our previously published study [7]. In an attempt to find possible protein targets for peptides to induce these damages in C. neoformans cells, computational simulations were employed. The target chosen was a transmembrane protein known as PHO36. PHO36 is a receptor adiponectin-like protein involved in lipid and phosphate metabolism in yeasts [28]. PHO36 works with RAS proteins in the same pathway that is involved in several cellular events essential for the life of yeasts, such as division, apoptosis, longevity, differentiation, nitrogen, and carbon nutrition [28]. Herein, molecular modeling analysis revealed that RcAlb-PepII, PepGAT, and PepKAA interact with PHO36 in the extracellular domain, resulting in conformational alterations to its structure. By interacting with PHO36 and changing its structures, peptides inhibit PHO36 function in cells, negatively affecting several cellular processes in yeasts. Additionally, misfunction is related to a stimulus for apoptosis in yeast cells. Lopes et al. [29] recently reported that a synthetic peptide interacting with PHO36 from C. albicans induced ROS accumulation, DNA fragmentation, and apoptosis. Our results revealed that RcAlb-PepII, PepGAT, and PepKAA interact with PHO36 and cause the same damage. These results suggest PHO36 as a new target for antimicrobial activity mediated by synthetic peptides."

Briefly, after the antifungal assay, the samples were washed with NaCl 0.15 M and centrifuged (5000\u00d7 g for 10 min at 4\u25e6C). Next, 9 \u00b5L of DCFH-DA was added, and cells were incubated for 20 min at 22 \u00b1 2\u25e6C in the dark. Then, the samples were washed two times with NaCl 0.15 mM and centrifuged as described. Finally, cryptococcal cells were transferred to slides and observed with a fluorescence microscope (Olympus System BX 41, Tokyo, Japan) with an excitation wavelength of 535 nm and an emission wavelength of 617 nm [31]. Qualitative and quantitative assays for anion superoxide followed the example of Choi et al. [32]. For the qualitative assay, C. neoformans cells were treated with SAMPs. Then, they were washed with 0.15 M NaCl to remove the excess media. Afterward, cells were incubated with 0.1 mM of nitroblue tetrazolium (NBT) for 3 h at room temperature (22 \u00b1 2\u25e6C) in the dark. Cells were then visualized using a light microscope (Olympus System BX 41, Tokyo, Japan). The quantitative assay was placed in the same way as the qualitative. The difference was that the quantitative assay was performed in 96-well plates, and the conversion of NBT to formazan was quantified at 630 nm in a microplate reader (Epoch, Biotek, Santa Clara, CA, United States). In addition, the same assay used to detect H2O2 was performed in the presence of 10 mM ascorbic acid (AsA) [20]. Moreover, the pore formation in the presence and absence of 10 mM AsA was assessed using the Propidium Iodide (PI) influx assay, following the methodology described in [7].\n4.4. Redox System Enzyme Activity 4.4.1. Catalase (CAT)\nThe CAT activity was assessed according to [33] to evaluate the catalase activity. After the antifungal assay, conducted at the same conditions described previously, cells were washed three times with 0.15 M NaCl, resuspended in 0.05 M sodium acetate buffer pH 5.2, frozen for 24 h, sonicated for 30 min, and centrifuged for 10 min (10,000\u00d7 g at 4 \u25e6C), and the supernatant was collected as described by [20]. A total of 200 \u00b5L of samples were incubated with 700 \u00b5L phosphate buffer with 50 mM potassium, pH 7.0, at 30 \u25e6C for 10 min. Subsequently, 100 \u00b5L of 112 mM H2O2 was added, starting the reaction. The mixture was placed into a quartz cuvette (1 cm\u22121) and absorbance was assessed. The reduction in absorbance at 240 nm was measured at intervals of 10 s until reaching 1 min. A decrease of 1.0 absorbance unit per minute was assumed to represent 1 unit of catalase activity (AU).\n4.4.2.

Then, the reactional mixture was placed in a 96-well microplate, exposed to fluorescent light (32 W), and read at 630 nm in intervals of 1 min until reaching 5 min. All reagents without yeast extract (replaced by ultrapure water) were used as controls. The enzyme activity was measured as the difference between the absorbance recorded for the light reaction and the corresponding dark reaction (estimated per min). This was expressed in activity units (AU). One unit of SOD activity (1 AU) corresponded to the amount of the sample needed to inhibit the photoreduction of NBT by 50%."
