    "abstractText": "This research aims to develop a microwave sensor to accurately measure the concentration of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) in water\u2013DMSO binary mixtures. The proposed sensor will utilize microwave frequency measurements to determine the DMSO concentration, providing a non-invasive and efficient method for analyzing DMSO solutions. The research will involve the design, fabrication, and testing of the sensor, as well as the development of an appropriate calibration model. The outcomes of this study will contribute to improved monitoring and quality control in various fields, including pharmaceuticals, chemical synthesis, and biomedical research. The binary mixtures of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and water with varying concentrations were investigated in the frequency range of 1 GHz to 5 GHz at room temperature using a microwave sensor. The proposed microwave sensor design was based on an interdigital capacitor (IDC) microstrip antenna loaded with a hexagonal complementary ring resonator (HCRR). The performance of the sensor, fabricated using the print circuit board (PCB) technique, was validated through simulations and experiments. The reflection coefficient (S11) and resonance frequency (Fr) of binary mixtures of DMSO and water solutions were recorded and analyzed for DMSO concentrations ranging from 0% v/v to 75% v/v. Mathematical models were developed to analyze the data, and laboratory tests showed that the sensor can detect levels of DMSO/water binary mixtures. The sensor is capable of detecting DMSO concentrations ranging from 0% v/v to 75% v/v, with a maximum sensitivity of 0.138 dB/% for S11 and \u2206S11 and 0.2 MHz/% for Fr and \u2206Fr at a concentration of 50% v/v. The developed microwave sensor can serve as an alternative for detecting DMSO concentrations in water using a simple and costeffective technique. This method can effectively analyze a wide range of concentrations, including highly concentrated solutions, quickly and easily.",

            "text": "Dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), also known as (CH3)2SO, is a colorless, water-soluble, hygroscopic, slightly alkaline organic non-toxic liquid with a slight odor that boils at 189 \u25e6C and freezes at 18.5 \u25e6C. DMSO is a widely used solvent in the fields of biology, chemistry, pharmacology, and medicine for various applications [1,2]. Its advantageous properties, including low toxicity and environmental compatibility, make it a highly valuable polar aprotic solvent for a variety of applications. Among its many uses, it serves as a cryopreservation agent for cells, a penetration enhancer in topical treatments, and a vital component in the fields of toxicology and pharmacology [3\u20135]. However, it is known that high concentrations of DMSO are cytotoxic. Therefore, it is important to measure and define threshold concentrations of DMSO for cells [6]. DMSO is often a principal additive in assay buffers,\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 1378. https://doi.org/10.3390/mi14071378 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/micromachines\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 1378 2 of 16\nwith a concentration normally ranging from 0.1% to 5% [7]. It is generally accepted to be non-toxic at concentrations below 10% [3\u20135]. Nevertheless, it should be noted that excessive concentrations of DMSO above 50% introduced into the bloodstream can lead to hemolysis, while direct intravenous injection of DMSO may cause local irritation and necrosis [8]. Therefore, measuring and monitoring the DMSO concentration is very important. Many methods exist for detecting the DMSO concentration, such as gas chromatography (GC) [9], high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) [10], mass spectrometry (MS) [11], nearinfrared (NIR) spectroscopy [12], and the organic sulfur sequential chemical analysis robot (OSSCAR) [13]. In addition to measuring the DMSO concentration, research has also been conducted on the behavior resulting from the mixing of DMSO with water. The mixing behavior of the DMSO/water system is widely recognized for its strong non-ideal characteristics. Solutions comprising this solvent mixture deviate significantly from the ideal behavior and manifest physical and chemical properties that deviate from the norm of what is generally anticipated for an ideal solution. The non-ideal characteristics of the DMSO/water system are evident in various physical properties, including viscosity, density, calorimetry, refractive index, hygroscopicity, and the translational and rotational motion of DMSO\u2013water mixtures [14\u201316]. Understanding the interaction between DMSO and water is crucial for elucidating the mechanisms underlying ice-blocking and biological toxicity. Furthermore, the distinct characteristics of DMSO\u2013water mixtures have been extensively explored and analyzed through a variety of methods, including molecular dynamics (MD) simulations [17\u201321], soft X-ray spectra [22], neutron diffraction [23,24], vibrational spectroscopy [25], dielectric spectroscopy [26], Rydberg electron-transfer spectroscopy [27], a high-pressure spectroscopic probe [28], infrared absorption spectroscopy [29,30], Raman spectroscopy [31], and Fourier-transform microwave spectroscopy [32]. Another method that has gained interest today is the measurement of material properties using microwave sensors, which has many advantages, such as being easy to build, cheap, and small in size. Additionally, the results can be checked and analyzed in real time. The use of microwave sensors for measuring solution concentrations has been confirmed in various research applications, including the determination of concentrations of salt [33,34], sugar [33,35\u201339], nitrate and phosphate [40,41], alcohol [42], ethanol [43\u201346], methanol [47], glycerol [48], metal ions [49], and equol [50]. However, various research reviews have revealed that there has not been a study or proof of measuring the concentration of DMSO mixed with water using a microwave sensor. We are pleased to present the results of our study, which investigated the use of a microwave sensor to measure the DMSO concentration in water at room temperature. Our method is simple, low-cost, and capable of rapidly analyzing a wide range of concentrations, including high-concentration solutions. With easy operation, we tested concentrations from 0% v/v to 75% v/v."

The magnitude of the S11 and Fr data at various DMSO concentrations were searched and analyzed to find the relationship between them. The horizontal axis displays the concentration of DMSO, while the left vertical axes show the values of S11 and Fr, as shown in Figure 7a,b, respectively.\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 1378 7 of 16\nScattered data points for both the S11 and Fr datasets were plotted and fitted to curved trendlines, allowing for the study of the resulting relationship between the variables. The change in S11 and Fr resulting from the alteration in the concentration of DMSO mixed with water is caused by a variation in the real and imaginary components of the complex permittivity of the DMSO/water binary mixture. The response of the microwave sensor was established by measuring the levels of S11 and Fr at various concentrations of DMSO. The relationship between the levels of S11 and Fr at different concentrations of DMSO was then determined using a mathematical model developed through linear regression analysis, which links DMSO concentrations with measurable S11 and Fr levels. Equation (2) was used to calculate the levels of S11 at various DMSO concentrations, which were plotted in Figure 7a. Likewise, the levels of Fr at various DMSO concentrations were calculated using Equation (3) and plotted in Figure 7b. The study revealed that the standard deviation (SD) value of Fr was lower than that of S11, indicating that the Fr values were more consistent and less dispersed compared to the S11 values.\nS11(dB) = \u22120.0966\u03c1\u2212 7.2069 with R2 = 0.9664 (2)\nFr(GHz) = \u221214\u00d7 104\u03c1+ 3.63\u00d7 109 with R2 = 0.9800 (3)\nwhere \u03c1 represents the concentration of DMSO in units of % v/v. The relationship between the magnitude of S11 and Fr, obtained from the mathematical model, and the concentration of DMSO in the range of 0\u201375% v/v was found to be linear with a negative slope. The results indicated that the magnitude of both S11 and Fr altered when the concentration of DMSO varied between 0 to 75% v/v. This step is essential as fluctuations in the complex relative permittivity (\u03b5r) of the sample have the potential to influence the sensor response, which is discernible from the changes in S11 and Fr measurements. The changes observed in the S11 at resonance can be attributed to variations in the sensor impedance, which, in turn, are influenced by the imaginary component (\u03b5\u2032\u2032r ) of the \u03b5r. On the other hand, the change in Fr is primarily influenced by variations in CR, which is a consequence of changes in the real component (\u03b5\u2032r) of the \u03b5r of the mixed DMSO/water sample. The equation below represents the frequency (f) dependent behavior of the complex relative permittivity for mixed DMSO/water solutions:\n\u03b5r(f) = \u03b5\u2032r(f)\u2212 j\u03b5 \u2032\u2032 r (f) (4)\nThe \u03b5r can be expressed as a function of the \u03b5\u2032r and the \u03b5 \u2032\u2032 r [21,51\u201355]. In conducting\nsamples, the \u03b5\u2032\u2032r has two contributions, as shown below:\n\u03b5 \u2032\u2032 r (f) = \u03b5 \u2032\u2032 rd(f)\u2212 \u03b5 \u2032\u2032 r\u03c3(f) (5)\nThe \u03b5\u2032\u2032r is composed of two contributions, namely the dielectric relaxation in dimethyl sulfoxide/loss (\u03b5\u2032\u2032rd) and the loss due to ion drift (\u03b5 \u2032\u2032 r\u03c3). At low frequencies, the loss due to ion drift tends to obscure the dielectric contribution of ions.\n\u03b5 \u2032\u2032 r\u03c3 =\n\u03c3\n\u03b502\u03c0f (6)\nHere, \u03c3 represents the ionic conductivity, and \u03b50 denotes the permittivity of free space [55].

The sensitivity calculations, obtained from the S11, Fr, \u2206S11, and \u2206Fr values, are presented in Equations (11)\u2013(14), respectively.\nSS11 = \u2206S11 \u2206\u03c1\n(11)\nSFr = \u2206Fr \u2206\u03c1\n(12)\nS\u2206S11 = \u2206(\u2206S11)\n\u2206\u03c1 (13)\nS\u2206Fr = \u2206(\u2206Fr)\n\u2206\u03c1 (14)\nFigure 9a demonstrates that the sensitivity for S11 and \u2206S11 remains consistent across various concentrations of DMSO. However, the sensitivity derived from S11 will yield a negative value. Similarly, the sensitivity for Fr and \u2206Fr was found to be consistent across different concentrations of DMSO, with the sensitivity derived from Fr being negative, as shown in Figure 9b. When examining the sensitivity derived from all four parameters in Figure 9, it becomes evident that the sensitivity escalates as the DMSO concentration\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 1378 11 of 16\nincreases until it reaches a maximum at 50% v/v. Subsequently, the sensitivity gradually diminishes with further increments in the DMSO concentration.\nMicromachines 2023, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 16\nSS11 = \u2206S11 \u2206\u03c1 (11)\nSFr = \u2206Fr \u2206\u03c1 (12)\nS\u2206S11 = \u2206(\u2206S11) \u2206\u03c1 (13)\nS\u2206Fr = \u2206(\u2206Fr) \u2206\u03c1 (14)\n(a)\n(b)\nFigure 9.

            "text": "The measurements of the mixed DMSO/water concentration using planar microwave sensors have been presented for the first time. Nevertheless, we conducted a comparative analysis between the concentration range and parameters measured by each technique with the proposed method in order to present a more concise overview of the mixed DMSO/water measurements obtained through different techniques. This analysis is illustrated in Table 2. Unfortunately, due to a lack of available data on the sensitivity of other methods used to measure mixed DMSO/water, we are unable to compare our sen-\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 1378 12 of 16\nsitivity findings. Our study allows for an evaluation of the electrical response of mixed DMSO/water in the microwave frequency range across a wide concentration range, including extremely high concentrations. The analysis of mixed DMSO/water commonly involves a variety of techniques, including GC [9], HPLC [10], MS [11], NIR [12,29,30], OSSCAR [13], soft X-ray [22], dielectric spectroscopy [26], and Raman spectroscopy [31]. GC, MS, and HPLC are renowned for their exceptional performance in measuring mixed DMSO/water, owing to their ability to offer high resolution, specificity, and sensitivity features. These techniques are particularly well suited to analyze low molecular weight compounds and mixtures, making them an excellent choice for such applications. Nevertheless, it is important to note that these methods involve intricate procedures, extended analysis times, frequently require labor-intensive sample pretreatment, and involve costly equipment in addition to necessitating highly specialized technical staff for operation. NIR spectroscopy is a useful and widely used technique for the analysis of mixed solutions, offering several advantages, including speed, efficiency, and non-destructiveness, but also has some limitations, including interferences and the need for specialized instrumentation and expertise. The OSSCAR technique has many advantages for mixed solution measurement, including high selectivity, high sensitivity, and high speed. However, it also has its disadvantages, including complexity, cost, limited scope, and demanding sample preparation. The soft X-ray technique offers several benefits for mixed solution measurement, including high sensitivity, element specificity, and non-destructiveness. Despite these advantages, the technique also has some limitations, including cost, complexity, demanding sample preparation, and limited scope of detection. The equipment required for soft X-ray analysis can be expensive, which may make it difficult for some laboratories to access. Additionally, the techniques involved can be complex and may require specialized technical staff to operate, and the sample preparation process can be demanding and time-consuming, which may impact the accuracy of the results. The advantages of using dielectric spectroscopy for mixed solution measurement include high sensitivity, non-invasiveness, and versatility. The technique can detect small changes in the electrical properties of a sample, making it possible to detect trace amounts of substances, and it does not require any modification of the sample, making it a non-invasive option. Additionally, it can be used for a wide range of applications, including liquids, solids, and suspensions. However, dielectric spectroscopy also has its disadvantages. The analysis of mixed solutions using this technique can be complex and may require specialized technical knowledge. Raman spectroscopy is a highly specific technique for mixed solution measurement, providing molecular-level information without altering the sample. However, its low sensitivity and complexity, as well as the cost and potential requirement for sample preparation, can be disadvantages. Nevertheless, we would like to emphasize that our proposed sensor presents a simple and cost-effective solution that provides rapid analysis, wide concentration measurement capabilities (including high concentrations), and user-friendly operation. In [43\u201348], the sensors exhibit high sensitivity and require a small sample size. However, these sensors necessitate the use of two ports for measurement. Moreover, the integration of microfluidics introduces a complex process of sensor fabrication and assembly. Consequently, the cost of building such sensors is also elevated. In [38], the sensor demonstrates a high level of sensitivity while utilizing only one measurement port. However, such sensors need to be combined with the lump elements. Furthermore, the integration of microfluidics adds complexity to the fabrication and assembly processes of these sensors. As a result, the construction cost of such sensors is also increased. However, the sensitivity of the sensor presented in this study is determined based on measurements of a mixed DMSO/water concentration. Previous studies that utilized microfluidic microwave sensors employed different substances and concentration units, which is frankly inconsistent with the parameters of this study. Consequently, making reasonable comparisons becomes challenging.\nMicromachines 2023, 14, 1378 13 of 16\nNA\u2014data not available."
