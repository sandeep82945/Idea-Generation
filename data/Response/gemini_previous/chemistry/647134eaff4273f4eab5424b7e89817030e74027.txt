1. **Investigate the use of the Bind&Bite method for the site-selective modification of proteins in living cells.** This could be achieved by using cell-penetrating peptides or other delivery methods to introduce the activated peptide precursors into cells, where they could react with target proteins that are fused to the complementary peptide. This approach could be used to study protein-protein interactions, protein localization, and other cellular processes.


2. **Develop new peptide adapter domains that are compatible with the Bind&Bite method.** This could be done by screening libraries of peptides for those that form stable heterodimers with the original peptide adapters. Alternatively, computational methods could be used to design new peptide adapters with the desired properties.


3. **Explore the use of the Bind&Bite method for the site-selective modification of proteins with non-canonical amino acids.** This could be achieved by using activated peptide precursors that contain non-canonical amino acids in place of the glutamate or lysine residues. This approach could be used to introduce new functionalities into proteins, such as unnatural cross-linking sites, fluorophores, or affinity tags.


4. **Investigate the use of the Bind&Bite method for the site-selective modification of proteins with multiple chemical moieties.** This could be achieved by using activated peptide precursors that contain multiple reactive groups. Alternatively, multiple rounds of the Bind&Bite reaction could be performed, using different activated peptide precursors each time. This approach could be used to create proteins with complex patterns of chemical modifications.


5. **Develop new applications for the Bind&Bite method in biotechnology and biomedical research.** This could include using the method to create new protein-based therapeutics, diagnostics, and research tools. For example, the Bind&Bite method could be used to create targeted protein delivery systems, or to develop new methods for protein purification and analysis.
