    "abstractText": "We extend the classical phase-space distribution function to include the spin and electromagnetic fields coupling and derive the modified constitutive relations for charge current, energy-momentum tensor, and spin tensor. Because of the coupling, the new tensors receive corrections to their perfect fluid counterparts and make the background and spin fluid equations of motion communicate with each other. We investigate special cases which are relevant in high-energy heavy-ion collisions, including baryon free matter and large mass limit. Using Bjorken symmetries, we find that spin polarization increases with increasing magnetic field for an initially positive baryon chemical potential. The corrections derived in this framework may help to explain the splitting observed in Lambda hyperons spin polarization measurements.",

            "text": "Over the last few decades, relativistic heavy-ion collision experiments at RHIC and LHC have provided a unique opportunity for the study of the properties of hot and dense relativistic nuclear matter under extreme conditions [1]. The system produced by the colliding nuclei at high collision energies has been shown to quickly evolve from the initial nonequilibrium glasma state to an equilibrated quark-gluon plasma (QGP) phase and eventually recombine into hadrons below the freezeout temperature [2, 3, 4, 5]. Using the theory of relativistic hydrodynamics it was shown that QGP matter produced this way forms the smallest fluid droplets ever observed which exhibit a nearly perfect fluid behavior [6, 7, 8, 9, 10]. The success of hydrodynamic description of relativistic heavy-ion collisions has opened new avenues in theoretical studies of relativistic matter, including the development of the theory of hydrodynamics and its off equilibrium applications [11]. Particularly interesting directions of study which are recently being followed include investigations of spin polarization phenomena in relativistic nuclear matter [12, 13] and its dynamics under the influence of electromagnetic fields (EM) [14, 15, 16]. Recent spin polarization measurements of emitted particles provided a new probe for studying QGP [17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24] and triggered many theoretical developments [25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34], see also Refs. [35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44]. Being oriented along the direction of the global angular momentum of the colliding system, microscopically, the spin polarization is believed to arise because of the spin-orbit coupling [45]. On the other hand, since at the macroscopic level,\n\u2217Corresponding author Email addresses: rajeev.singh@stonybrook.edu (Rajeev Singh ),\nshokri@itp.uni-frankfurt.de (Masoud Shokri), tabatabaee@ipm.ir (S. M. A. Tabatabaee Mehr)\nthe QGP admits close-to-equilibrium dynamics, it is believed that the spin degrees of freedom undergo the thermalization as well. This may allow generation of spin polarization through the coupling between the fluid vorticity and spin of its constituents [46]. While the agreement between the global polarization measurements and \u201cspin-thermal\u201d models supports the hypothesis of polarization-vorticity coupling [47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52], the same theories do not quite explain the measurements related to differential observables [48, 51, 53]; though there are some recent advances in this direction [54, 55, 56, 57]. Discrepancies between the theoretical predictions and the experimental data indicate that the current theoretical understanding of spin polarization dynamics in heavy-ion collisions is incomplete. If the spin degrees of freedom are thermalized, they should be incorporated into the hydrodynamic formalism on the same footing as the other macroscopic quantities, allowing for their non-trivial dynamics. To this end, several frameworks considering spin as a dynamical quantity were developed that used thermodynamic equilibrium [58], perfect fluid spin hydrodynamics [25, 26], effective action approach [59, 38, 41, 60, 61], method of entropy current analysis [35, 36, 37, 62, 63, 64], statistical operator formalism [65], nonlocal collisions [66, 67, 68, 39, 69, 42, 70, 71, 72, 73], kinetic theory for massless fermions [74, 75, 76, 66, 77], holographic method [78, 79, 40, 41, 80, 81], anomalous hydrodynamics [82, 83], and Lagrangian method [84, 85]. Also see Refs. [86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91] for the studies related to helicity polarization. Relativistic hydrodynamics with spin proposed in Refs. [25, 26] was further developed [27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32] and also extended to dissipative systems in Refs. [33, 34]. In its current form, the spin hydrodynamics framework does not include interactions with the electromagnetic field which may possibly be present in the early-time evolution of QGP. Such a coupling may be crucial for the explanation of the splitting in \u039b and \u039b\u0304\nPreprint submitted to Nuclear Physics A April 20, 2023\nar X\niv :2\n20 2.\n11 50\n4v 3\n[ he\npph\n] 1\n9 A\npr 2\n02 3\nspin polarization signal observed in the experiments [17, 92], which may arise because of opposite magnetic moments of these particles [47], for other approaches, see Refs. [93, 88]. In this work, we extend the spin hydrodynamics framework developed in Refs. [27, 28, 29] and include the coupling between spin and electromagnetic fields in the phase-space distribution function of the constituent particles. We obtain modified constitutive relations for the baryon charge current, energy-momentum tensor, and spin tensor arising because of the coupling. Then, we investigate special cases of these quantities for the baryonfree system and the large mass limit, which are relevant to the physics of ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Finally, we study equations of motion in the case of Bjorken symmetry in the ideal MHD limit and obtain the evolution of the spin component. Although the qualitative features of spin polarization remains same as in Ref. [29] due to strong symmetries assumed herein, however, we find that magnetic field positively enhances the spin polarization for an initial positive baryon chemical potential. We think that in more realistic setup our framework will prove to be crucial in understanding the splitting between \u039b and \u039b\u0304 spin polarization."

[12].\nFor the classical treatment of particles having spin one half and mass m, phase-space distribution function with spin reads [28, 33]\nf \u00b10 (x, p, s) = f \u00b1 0 (x, p) exp [ 1 2 \u03c9(x) : s(p) ] , (1)\nwhere \u03c9\u03b1\u03b2(x) is the spin polarization tensor and s\u03b1\u03b2(p) represents the particle internal angular momentum expressed with spin four-vector s\u03b1 and four-momentum p\u03b1 as\ns\u03b1\u03b2 = 1 m \u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03b4p\u03b3s\u03b4 . (2)\nIn Eq. (1), f \u00b10 (x, p) = exp [\u2212p \u00b7 \u03b2(x) \u00b1 \u03be(x)] is the Ju\u0308ttner distribution, with \u03be(x) being the ratio of the baryon chemical potential \u00b5(x) over temperature T (x), \u03be = \u00b5/T , and \u03b2\u00b5(x) is the ratio of the fluid four-velocity U\u00b5(x) to temperature, \u03b2\u00b5 = U\u00b5/T . Note that, the classical distribution function (1) is valid only for the case of local collisions between particles, however, it can be extended to include nonlocal effects through the gradients of f \u00b10 (x, p, s) [28].\nWe generalize the phase-space distribution function (1) to a case of interaction between the particle magnetic moment and the external EM field by introducing the modified distribution function in the form\nf \u00b1s (x, p, s) = f \u00b1 0 (x, p, s) exp [\u2213\u03b1M(x)F(x) : s] , (3)\nwhere F\u00b5\u03bd is the Faraday tensor expressed in terms of electric E\u00b5 and magnetic B\u00b5 four-vectors as\nF\u00b5\u03bd = E\u00b5U\u03bd \u2212 E\u03bdU\u00b5 + \u00b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2U\u03b1B\u03b2, (4)\nwith E\u00b5 \u2261 F\u00b5\u03bdU\u03bd , B\u00b5 \u2261\n1 2 \u00b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2F\u03bd\u03b1U\u03b2 .

In this work, for simplicity, we assume that the quasiparticles are \u039b hyperons, with g\u039b = \u22120.6138 \u00b1 0.0047 [94]. However, it should be mentioned that, a more realistic setup needs multiple quark-like quasiparticles, with constitutive masses, see for example [31]. Keeping in mind the smallness of the amplitude of spin polarization in measurements [17], we assume the small polarization limit [29], \u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 1. We also assume weak EM fields eB M2, with M being a typical energy scale relevant to the system in consideration. If the quasiparticles are assumed to be electrically neutral Lambda hyperons, then M \u223c m\u039b. The aforementioned assumptions allow Eq. (3) to be approximated as\nf \u00b1s (x, p, s) = f \u00b1 0 (x, p)\n( 1 +\n1 2 \u03c9 : s\n) (1 \u2213 \u03b1MF : s) , (6)\nwhere f +s ( f \u2212 s ) represents the distribution function for particles (antiparticles). Similarly to the Faraday tensor, the spin polarization tensor \u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 in Eq. (6) can be decomposed with respect to the fluid four-velocity as [32]\n\u03c9\u00b5\u03bd = \u03ba\u00b5U\u03bd \u2212 \u03ba\u03bdU\u00b5 + \u00b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2U\u03b1\u03c9\u03b2, (7)\nwhere the four-vectors \u03ba\u00b5 and \u03c9\u00b5,\n\u03ba\u00b5 = \u03c9\u00b5\u03b1U\u03b1, \u03c9\u00b5 = 1 2 \u00b5\u03b1\u03b2\u03b3\u03c9 \u03b1\u03b2U\u03b3, (8)\nare orthogonal to U\u00b5 [32]. The above conditions leave \u03ba\u00b5 and \u03c9\u00b5 with three degrees of freedom each, constituting together the same number of degrees of freedom as \u03c9\u00b5\u03bd. These four-vectors can be written in terms of three space-like orthonormal vectors X\u00b5, Y\u00b5, and Z\u00b5 which span the plane transverse to U\u00b5. These vectors, together with U\u00b5, form a basis satisfying [29, 32]\nU \u00b7 U = 1 , X \u00b7 X = Y \u00b7 Y = Z \u00b7 Z = \u22121 .

(39)\n6. 0+1D: Bjorken flow\nIn this section, we examine our formulation with the Bjorken setup1 as a special situation relevant to the ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions.\nBjorken symmetries simplify equations of motion significantly; the hydrodynamic variables become functions of proper time \u03c4 = \u221a t2 \u2212 z2 alone, and energy-momentum conservation\nin the transverse direction (30) is trivially satisfied. Furthermore, the heat current Q\u00b5 (27) and the stress tensor T \u00b5\u03bd (28) disappear. Yet, even in this situation, the equations of motion of background and spin are highly coupled due to spin-EM contribution. The fluid flow is affected by the spin dynamics, which is different from the previous studies [29, 30, 31].\nWe start with the baryon charge conservation (19). The transverse current trivially satisfies \u2202\u00b5N \u00b5 \u22a5 = 0 due to Bjorken symmetries. Therefore the charge conservation reduces to an equation formally similar to that of Bjorken perfect fluid [29],\ndN d\u03c4 + N \u03c4 = 0 . (40)\n1In the case of Bjorken expansion the basis vectors are U\u03b1 = (cosh(\u03b7), 0, 0, sinh(\u03b7)), X\u03b1 = (0, 1, 0, 0), Y\u03b1 = (0, 0, 1, 0), and Z\u03b1 = (sinh(\u03b7), 0, 0, cosh(\u03b7)), where \u03b7 is the space-time rapidity [29].\nFor simplicity, we assume uncharged particles and the ideal MHD limit. Therefore, the profile of the magnetic field is [98]\nB\u00b5 = \u03b1B0 \u03c40 \u03c4 Y\u00b5 , (41)\nwith B0 = (1/e) m2\u03c0, with m\u03c0 being the Pion\u2019s mass, and \u03b1 being a positive dimensionless number. At the initial proper time \u03c40 the initial magnetic field is B0 = \u03b1B0. Setting \u03b1 = 0 switches off the magnetic field. Here, Y\u00b5 = (0, 0, 1, 0). Due to the magnetic field profile adopted herein, Eq. (41), we suspect that the only spin component C\u03c9Y will be coupled to the EM fields, which is indeed the case shown below.\nThe spin-EM coupling occurs through the term F : \u03c9 = \u22122B0C\u03c9Y\u03c40/\u03c4, which gives rise to\nN = NPF + 2 gT 3 \u03b1M B0 C\u03c9Y \u03c40 \u03c4\ncosh(\u03be) [ z2 K2(z)\n+ 2 z K1(z) + 2 (K2(z) + 3K3(z)) ] , (42)\nwhere NPF is given by Eq. (15). Here T , \u03be, and C\u03c9Y are unknown functions of \u03c4.\nThe next equation is the energy equation which reads\ndE d\u03c4 + E + P \u03c4 = 0 , (43)\nwhere\nE = gT 4 z2 (z K1(z) + 3 K3(z)) \u00d7 2 ( 2 cosh(\u03be) + \u03b1M B0 C\u03c9Y\n\u03c40 \u03c4\nsinh(\u03be) ) , (44)\nP = NPFT ( coth (\u03be) + \u03b1M B0 C\u03c9Y\n\u03c40 2\u03c4\n) . (45)\nWe solve the coupled set of equations (40), (43), and (36) to obtain the evolution of temperature T , baryon chemical potential \u00b5, and spin polarization components. In this setup, each spin polarization component evolve independently of each other [29]. Due to our magnetic field profile (41), the evolution of the spin component C\u03c9Y is modified by the spin-EM coupling, while other components are not affected, thus we will only study the evolution of C\u03c9Y . As we have assumed small polarization limit, \u03c9\u00b5\u03bd 1, the spin component must be initialized accordingly, i.e., it can take any positive value less than 1. Therefore, we choose initial value of the spin component as C\u03c9Y0 = 0.3 at \u03c40 = 0.5 fm/c. Let us consider four different cases of initial temperature T0 and baryon chemical potential \u00b50 corresponding to four different collision energies such as [99]\nT0 = 0.2 GeV, \u00b50 = 0.4 GeV for \u221a\nsNN = 7.7 GeV , T0 = 0.3 GeV, \u00b50 = 0.3 GeV for \u221a sNN = 27 GeV ,\nT0 = 0.3 GeV, \u00b50 = 0.15 GeV for \u221a\nsNN = 62.4 GeV , T0 = 0.6 GeV, \u00b50 = 0.05 GeV for \u221a sNN = 200 GeV ,\n(46)\nto observe the dependence of spin-EM coupling on different initial values of T and \u00b5.\nThe spin component C\u03c9Y also has physical relevance with respect to ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions, as it is expected\nthat the total angular momentum is initially purely orbital, negative and directed orthogonal to the reaction plane (i.e. along \u2212y axis) [17, 18, 19, 21, 22]. After the collision, this initial orbital angular momentum can be converted to spin angular momentum in the same direction. Therefore, to address such a physical system it is enough to assume a non-zero and small initial C\u03c9Y and set all other spin components to zero, see Ref. [29] for more details.\nFigure 1 shows the evolution of C\u03c9Y for two different sets of T0 and \u00b50 for \u221a sNN = 7.7 GeV (upper panel) and \u221a sNN = 27 GeV (lower panel), see Eq. (46). Similarly in Fig. 2 we show the evolution of the spin component C\u03c9Y for another two sets T0 and \u00b50 corresponding to collision energies \u221a sNN = 62.4 GeV (upper panel) and \u221a\nsNN = 200 GeV (lower panel). \u03b1 = 0 corresponds to the system without EM fields [29]. Since \u00b5 is initially positive, the magnetic field intensifies C\u03c9Y in each case. This enhancement is transferred to the final polarization of particles. For a fluid with initially negative chemical potential, the magnetic field suppresses the spin polarization. However, such a case is irrelevant to heavy-ion physics. For low collision energies, an increase in the collision energy, gives rise to a decrease in the amplitude of the spin component even in the case of zero magnetic field, see Figs. 1 and 2. However, when transiting to\nthe so-called high collision energies, for which \u00b50 is negligible with respect to T0, the effect of increasing the collision energy is conversed, i.e, it leads to an increase in the spin component\u2019s amplitude. For example, see the transition from \u221a sNN = 62.4 GeV to 200 GeV in Fig. 2. Not that we use large values of \u03b1 for demonstrative purposes. However, qualitative features remain same even for very small values of \u03b1.\nThe evolution of the spin component (C\u03c9Y ) is directly connected to the spin polarization of the \u039b(\u039b\u0304) hyperon emitted at the freeze-out hypersurface, \u2206\u03a3\u03bb = \u03c4U\u03bb dx dy d\u03b7, through the following expression of average spin polarization per particle \u3008\u03c0\u00b5\u3009p (suffix p signifies it is a momentum dependent quantity) [32, 100]\n\u3008\u03c0\u00b5\u3009p = Ep\nd\u03a0*\u00b5 (p) d3 p\nEp dN(p)\nd3 p\n, (47)\nwhere the numerator is the momentum distribution of the total Pauli-Luban\u0301ski (PL) four-vector and denominator is the momentum density of particles and antiparticles given, respec-\ntively, as [32]\nEp d\u03a0*\u00b5 (p)\nd3 p = \u2212 1 (2\u03c0)3m\n[ \u222b cosh(\u03be) \u2206\u03a3\u03bbp\u03bb e\u2212\u03b2\u00b7p\n\u00d7 (( \u03c9\u0303\u00b5\u03b2 + F\u0303\u00b5\u03b2 ) p\u03b2 )* ] , (48)\nand Ep\ndN(p) d3 p = 2 (4\u03c0)3\n\u222b cosh(\u03be) \u2206\u03a3\u03bbp\u03bb e\u2212\u03b2\u00b7p . (49)\nHere, \u03c9\u0303\u00b5\u03bd = (1/2) \u00b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\u03c9\u03b1\u03b2 and F\u0303\u00b5\u03bd = (1/2) \u00b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2F\u03b1\u03b2 are the dual forms of \u03c9\u00b5\u03bd and F\u00b5\u03bd, respectively, whereas the asterisk represents that quantities are in the particle rest frame (PRF). Integrating over momentum coordinates we obtain momentum independent spin polarization using Eq. (47) as [32]\n\u3008\u03c0\u00b5\u3009 =\n\u222b dP \u3008\u03c0\u00b5\u3009p Ep\ndN(p) d3 p\u222b\ndP Ep dN(p)\nd3 p\n\u2261\n\u222b d3 p\nd\u03a0*\u00b5 (p) d3 p\u222b\nd3 p dN(p)d3 p . (50)\nSince Bjorken symmetries force the hydrodynamic variables to be the functions of \u03c4 only, the factor cosh(\u03be), in Eq. (47), comes out of the integration and cancels out [29]. This makes Eq. (47) independent of the baryon chemical potential and therefore, within the Bjorken setup, we cannot observe the explicit \u00b5 dependency of \u039b\u2212\u039b\u0304 spin polarization. However, in more realistic setups [32, 101] this might not be the case. Since we assume that magnetic fields do not break Bjorken symmetries, the spin polarization evolution remains independent of the chemical potential with \u03b1 , 0. Thus, we refrain to show them here as they are qualitatively similar to the spin polarization results for Bjorken background without electromagnetic fields [29]."

We also mentioned certain special cases relevant to ultra-relativistic heavy-ion collisions. Lastly, we examined our formalism with Bjorken flow for four different sets of initial temperature and baryon chemical potential and found that with increasing collisional energy, the amplitude of spin component decreases in the low collision energy regime, while it increases otherwise. With some further considerations, the presented formalism may be relevant in explaining the observed \u039b \u2212 \u039b\u0304 spin polarization splitting.
