"Periosteum engineering or the creation of artificial periostea using hydrogel scaffolds is a growing and promising field. Osteogenic cells and molecules are encapsulated into single-layered or bi-layered hydrogel membrane scaffolds to mimic a natural periosteum. 3-D printing techniques can be applied to manufacture biomimetic artificial periostea with complex microstructures, with one key challenge being the vascularization of the constructs."
