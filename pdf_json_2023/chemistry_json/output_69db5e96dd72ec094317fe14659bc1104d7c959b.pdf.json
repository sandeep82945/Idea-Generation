    "abstractText": "Bacterial resistance to different antimicrobial agents is growing with alarming speed, especially when bacterial cells are living in biofilm. Hybrid nanoparticles, synthesized through the green method, hold promise as a potential solution to this challenge. In this study, 66 actinomycete strains were isolated from three distinct marine sources: marine sediment, the algae Codium bursa, and the marine sponge Chondrosia reniformis. From the entirety of the isolated strains, one strain, S26, identified as Saccharopolyspora erythrea, was selected based on its taxonomic position and significant antimicrobial activity. Using the biomass of the selected marine Actinobacteria, the green synthesis of eco-friendly silver carbonate nanoparticles (BioAg2CO3NPs) is reported for the first time in this pioneering study. The BioAg2CO3NPs were characterized using different spectroscopic and microscopic analyses; the synthesized BioAg2CO3NPs primarily exhibit a triangular shape, with an approximate size of 100 nm. Biological activity evaluation indicated that the BioAg2CO3NPs exhibited good antimicrobial activity against all tested microorganisms and were able to remove 58% of the biofilm formed by the Klebsiella pneumoniae kp6 strain.",

This resistance has significant health, economic, and environmental implications [1]. Compared to planktonic cells, various studies have demonstrated that bacterial resistance increases significantly when cells are in the biofilm state. Biofilm represents a unique microbial lifestyle, where bacteria are attached to a solid surface and enclosed within a self-produced extracellular polymeric substance, primarily composed of exopolysaccharides and proteins [2,3]. Consequently, both natural and synthetic classes of antimicrobial agents are currently unable to evade this phenomenon [4]. The current progress in addressing both bacterial resistance and biofilm problems involves the application of metallic nanoparticles obtained from green synthesis. This cutting-edge solution, derived from nanobiotechnology, is considered a boon in both the medical and industrial domains [5\u20137]. Different metals have been used for nanoparticle biosynthesis; however, the recent trend in this field is the biosynthesis of hybrid nanoparticles, combining multiple metal or mineral components to form novel nanomaterials. This approach allows for the enhancement of their properties, offering promising potential to effectively combat microbial resistance and tackle biofilm-related issues. Different biological entities can be used for the biosynthesis of nanoparticles, such as plants, fungi, and bacteria. Among bacteria, actinomycetes are well known for being a promising source of bioactive metabolites, making them particularly suitable for the synthesis of eco-friendly, cost-effective, and non-toxic metallic nanoparticles [8\u201311]. These filamentous bacteria are widely distributed and can be isolated from various terrestrial and marine environments. One of the well-known marine environments recognized for its geo-biodiversity is the Mediterranean coastline, which hosts more than 7% of the world\u2019s marine biodiversity, encompassing marine sediments, sponges, and algae, all of which are notable for their richness in actinomycete strains [12\u201314]. This coastal expanse holds the Algerian coast which spans 1622 km, and represents a yet untapped ecosystem, teeming a potential diversity of Actinobacteria strains, waiting to be discovered and harnessed [15\u201317]. Therefore, in response to the lack of published research material on such an important topic, this study sought to gather data on: (i) isolation, molecular identification, and assessment of the antimicrobial activity of marine actinomycetes isolated from sediments, algae, and marine sponges collected from the west coast of Algeria; (ii) the green synthesis of silver carbonate nanoparticles using marine Actinobacteria strain, followed by their characterization with a range of microscopic and spectroscopic techniques; and (iii) assessment of the biological activity of the biosynthesized silver carbonate nanoparticles."

The selection of the two marine organisms, Codium bursa and Chondrosia reniformis, for actinomycete isolation in the current study was motivated by the absence of previous research on the diversity of Actinobacteria linked to these marine sources collected from the Mediterranean coast. Previous studies have reported that sponges and algae host substantial microbial biomass, encompassing archaea, fungi, viruses, and bacteria. This symbiotic interaction yields diverse beneficial outcomes for both entities, including nutrient acquisition, metabolic processing, and chemical defense [18\u201320]. Moreover, several reports highlighted that marine sediments offer an excellent opportunity for the discovery of new microorganisms, which may contain a new gene cluster for the biosynthesis of novel natural products [21\u2013 23]. Furthermore, the Algerian coastal region stretches for 1622 km. Despite this long distance, this environment remains poorly investigated in terms of the biodiversity of microorganisms, including Actinobacteria, as an attractive source of new bioactive compounds, and only a few studies have been reported. Djinni et al., 2014 [24] isolated the marine strain Streptomyces sundarbansensis from brown algae collected from the Algerian coastline. This strain produces the [=2-hydroxy-5-((6-hydroxy-4-oxo-4H-pyran-2-yl)methyl)-2propylchroman-4-one] compound, which exhibits activity against Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). In another study, Ouchene et al., 2021 [25] obtained numerous Actinobacteria strains from the coast of Bejaia City (Algeria), using different selective isolation methods. Moreover, previous studies showed that the composition of culture media significantly affected the number and diversity of Actinobacteria strains [26\u201328]. Therefore, to enhance the isolation of Actinobacteria from the three marine sources, four culture media were used. The results indicated that SCA and M2 were the most efficient culture media for actinomycete isolation since 25 and 23 actinomycete strains were obtained from each culture medium, respectively. However, ISP2 and M4 provide only 10 and 8 Actinobacteria strains, respectively (Figure 1B).\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n30\nM2 SCA SP2 M4\nC ol\non ie\ns n um\nbe r\nCulture media\nFigure 1.

Therefore, the Actinobacteria strains showed higher activity against Gram-positive bacteria than Gram-negative bacteria. This difference in sensitivity can be ascribed to the morphological difference between the cell walls of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, in particular, the presence of lipopolysaccharides in the outer membrane of Gram-negative bacteria, which makes the bacterial cell more impermeable to the lipophilic compounds. However, Gram-positive bacteria are more susceptible due to the absence of lipopolysaccharides [29]. Regarding resistance, L. monocytogenes was the most resistant bacteria tested. This resistance can be attributed to intrinsic mechanisms, such as efflux pumps, which can pump out or neutralize antimicrobial compounds, making the eradication of L. monocytogenes challenging [1]. In contrast, Bacillus cereus and Micrococcus lotus were the most sensitive tested microorganisms. The highest inhibition area values ranged from 21 to 30 mm, and they were observed for strain S26 against the four tested bacteria: A. baumannii, S. aureus, M. luteus, and B. cereus."

By using BLAST analysis, the obtained sequences were compared to the closest homologous sequences. The results of molecular identification, shown in Supplementary Table S2, indicated that the identified isolates shared sequence similarities that ranged from 99 to 100% with 3 different Actinobacteria genera, including Streptomyces (11 strains), Nocardiopsis (7 strains), and Saccharopolyspora (1 strain). Previous studies indicated that the genera Streptomyces, Nocardiopsis, and Saccharopolyspora have been widely isolated from different marine sources, which were collected from distinct geographical locations, including marine sediments [30], marine sponges [31,32], marine invertebrates such as corals [33] and molluscs [34], and algae [16]. After the molecular identification of the 19 active strains, 9 actinobacterial isolates, which exhibited the best antimicrobial activity against the pathogenic microorganisms, were selected for phylogenetic study. This aimed to determine the phylogenetic relationships between the selected strains and the closest species. The results are shown in Figure 2. The obtained dendrogram differentiated the nine selected strains into three clusters. In fact, the strains V17, CS44, RH94, and S29, were spread in four different phyletic lines within the Streptomyces group, and they showed 99.50%, 99.30%, 99.75%, and 99.75% of sequence similarity, with type strains, Streptomyces sampsonii DSM 40394, Streptomyces pseudogriseolus strain NRRL B-3288, Streptomyces fulvissimus strain DSM 40593, and Streptomyces armeniacus DSM 43125, respectively. However, the isolates C19, CHB2, A58, and M23, which belong to the Nocardiopsis cluster (Figure 2), form three separated branches within the phylogenetic tree and are close to the species Nocardiopsis terrae YIM 90022 (99.30% similarity), Nocardiopsis arvandica DSM 45278 (100% similarity), and Nocardiopsis dassonvillei IMRU 509 (99.75% similarity), respectively.

Moreover, the extracted data from the plot clearly indicate that the average crystallite size of the BioAg2CO3NPs is 103 nm. A previous study conducted by Loncarevic et al., (2017) [43], reported the synthesis of rod-like Ag2CO3 nanoparticles in water through a precipitation reaction between NaHCO3 and AgNO3, in the presence of polyvinylpyrrolidone, with a size range from 20 to 50 nm. The synthesis of silver carbonate nanoparticles has been previously accomplished through a range of physical and chemical methods [43\u201346].

Microscopic Characterization of the Silver Carbonate Nanoparticles Different microscopic methods, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM), were utilized to examine the morphology, size, and surface topology of the silver carbonate nanoparticles synthesized using the biomass of strain S26. The results are illustrated in Figure 7.\nFigure 7. Scanning electron microscope (A) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) (B), of\nBioAg2CO3NPs synthesized from the biomass of strain Saccharopolyspora erythraea S26. Green arrow:\nBioAg2CO3NPs with triangular shape, white arrow: BioAg2CO3NPs with rectangular shape.\nMicroscopic analysis through SEM of silver carbonate nanoparticles biosynthesized using the biomass of strain S26 unveiled diverse morphological shapes and uniform distribution, with only a minor presence of particle aggregation (Figure 7A). The prevalent form observed was triangular (indicated by the green arrow) (Figure 7A), while other shapes, such as rectangular (indicated by the white arrow) and spherical, were also detected (Figure 7A). Moreover, the SEM results indicated that the average size of Bio Ag2CO3NPs ranges from 90 nm to 110 nm, thus confirming the findings from the X-ray diffraction data (Figure 6). Various parameters, including the preparation process, the strain used for synthesis, and the culture conditions such as pH and temperature, exert a significant influence on the morphology and size of the synthesized nanoparticles [50]. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) was used to provide a precise three-dimensional representation of the surface topology of the silver carbonate nanoparticles biosynthesized using the biomass of strain S26. The results indicate that the surface topology of the BioAg2CO3NPs displayed a triangular shape, as revealed by the AFM findings (Figure 7B). It is important to highlight that the geometrical shape directly affects various attributes, including surface area, optical properties, catalytic activity, as well as their interactions with surrounding environments, such as biological systems [51\u201353].\n2.6. Biological Activity of Silver Carbonate Nanoparticles 2.6.1. Antimicrobial Activity\nThe antibacterial activity of BioAg2CO3NPs was evaluated against a range of pathogenic bacteria and fungi using the agar well diffusion method. Furthermore, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) against the same tested microorganisms was determined through the serial dilution method. The results are presented in Table 2.\nMar. Drugs 2023, 21, 536 11 of 19\nBased on the results presented in Table 2, it is clear that the BioAg2CO3NPs synthesized by strain S26 exhibited notable antibacterial activity against the full range of examined pathogens, with inhibition diameters ranging from 11 mm to 21 mm (Supplementary Figure S3). The MIC of nanoparticles synthesized using the biomass of strain S26 was subsequently assessed against each of the tested microorganisms, as detailed in Table 2. The results demonstrate that BioAg2CO3NPs are efficient antibacterial agents against all tested microbes, with MIC values ranging from 18.75 to 150 \u00b5g/mL. The biological activity of nanoparticles is significantly influenced by their characteristics. Several studies have shown that the size of nanoparticles and their antibacterial activity are inversely correlated; in other words, the smaller the nanoparticle size, the greater the surface interaction area with microbial cells, resulting in heightened antimicrobial activity. [54,55]. Additionally, the antimicrobial potential of BioAg2CO3NPs is also shape-dependent [56]. In this context, Pal et al. (2007) [57] found that triangular silver nanoparticles were more effective against E. coli compared to spherical nanoparticles. The vulnerability observed in the tested bacteria and fungi towards BioAg2CO3NPs can be attributed to the nanoparticles\u2019 ability to attack microbial cells simultaneously through multiple mechanisms, including protein inactivation, the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [58], and the formation of free radicals [59]. Consequently, pathogenic microorganisms become incapable of developing resistance to BioAg2CO3NPs, unlike traditional chemical antimicrobial agents, such as antibiotics and antifungals, which act on microbial cells via only one mechanism. Due to this rarity of microorganisms\u2019 resistance to BioAg2CO3NPs, the use of these nanoparticles offers a potential alternative to overcoming multidrug-resistant microorganisms [60,61].\n2.6.2. Antibiofilm Activity\nThe microtiter dish biofilm formation assay was conducted to evaluate and assess the antibiofilm activity of BioAg2CO3NPs against the biofilm formed by Klebsiella pneumoniae kp6 strain. The experiment was performed in the presence of BioAg2CO3NPs, with a final concentration of 150 \u00b5g/mL, corresponding to the MIC determined against the kp6 strain (Table 2). The results can be found in Figure 8 and Supplementary Figure S4. The capacity of BioAg2CO3NPs to remove the biofilm formed over 24 h by Klebsiella pneumoniae kp6 strain was initially assessed through a visual comparison between the wells treated with BioAg2CO3NPs and those of the negative control (wells without BioAg2CO3NPs). A clear decrease in the color intensity of crystal violet was observed in wells exposed to BioAg2CO3NPs, suggesting good antibiofilm activity against the biofilm formed by the Klebsiella pneumoniae kp6 strain (Supplementary Figure S4). In order to quantify the anti-biofilm activity of BioAg2CO3NPs, UV-vis spectroscopy was performed. The results are presented in Figure 8. As illustrated in Figure 8, the BioAg2CO3NPs synthesized using the biomass of strain S26 successfully eradicated 58% of the biofilm formed by the Klebsiella pneumoniae kp6 strain, confirming then the good antibiofilm activity of BioAg2CO3NPs, observed in Supplementary Figure S4.

Furt ermore, the size an shape of nanoparticles significantly influence their antibiofilm activity.

Additionally, rod-shaped nanoparticles have demonstrated superior antibiofilm activity compared to spherical ones [66,67]."

The PCR reaction was conducted within microtubes of 200 \u00b5L, which contained 50 \u00b5L total reaction volume formed by: 22 \u00b5L of PCR water, 25 \u00b5L of JumpStar Ready Mix (JSRM, Sigma-Aldrich, Berlin, Germany), 1 \u00b5L forward primer, and 1 \u00b5L reverse primer, as well as 1 \u00b5L of template DNA. One tube, without DNA, was used as a control. The PCR reaction was performed in a Mastercycler Gradient (Eppendorf, Germany). The PCR products were purified with NucleoSpin\u00ae Gel and PCR Clean-up-Kit (Macherey Nagel, D\u00fcren, Germany), and then recovered in 30 \u00b5L of elution buffer. The success of PCR was verified through 0.8% agarose gel electrophoresis for 50 min at 70 V in TAE buffer. The partial sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene of actinomycetes strains was accomplished with two primers, F27 and R518. The quality of the resulting sequences was checked manually using the Bioedit alignment program. Furthermore, the obtained sequences were aligned and compared with those available on the GenBank database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST, accessed on 10 March 2023). The phylogenetic tree was calculated with the software MEGA 7, using the neighbor-joining method [69,70].\nMar. Drugs 2023, 21, 536 14 of 19\nThe resulting tree topologies were evaluated using the bootstrap resampling method of 1000 replicates [71].\n3.4.2.

            "text": "3.5.1. Biosynthesis of Silver Carbonate Nanoparticles\nOne piece of 1 cm3 was cut from a 14-day-old culture of the selected strain and then inoculated into an Erlenmeyer flask (250 mL) containing 100 mL of ISP2 medium. After 5 days of incubation at 30 \u25e6C in a shaker (120 rpm), the biomass was separated from the supernatant by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 30 min. The collected biomass was subsequently subjected to two to three washes to eliminate the residual medium components adhered to the cells [74]. A 2 g portion from the obtained biomass of the selected strain, was suspended in a 250 mL Erlenmeyer flask containing 50 mL of silver nitrate (AgNO3) and 50 mL of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) solutions. Both solutions were prepared with an equal concentration of 500 mM in distilled water. Following a 72-h incubation period in the dark at 30 \u25e6C and under agitation (150 rpm), the biosynthesis of silver carbonate nanoparticles (BioAg2CO3NPs) was visually detected by observing a color shift from the initial pale yellow (the color of the biomass post-washing) to a dark brown. The biosynthesized BioAg2CO3NPs were isolated from the biomass through ultrasonic disruption at 30 \u25e6C for 30 min, followed by high-speed centrifugation (18,000\u00d7 g for 30 min). Subsequently, the collected BioAg2CO3NPs were dried at 100 \u25e6C [75].\n3.5.2. Characterization of Synthesized Silver Carbonate Nanoparticles\nThe characterization step of the synthesized BioAg2CO3NPs by the selected strain, aimed to gain a comprehensive understanding of their properties, composition, morphology, and size. To achieve this, the synthesized pellets of BioAg2CO3NPs were dispersed in sterile double-distilled water and centrifuged for 10 min at 10,000 rpm. The nanoparticle pellets were dried at 50 \u25e6C and were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD) (Malvern Panalytical, Empyrean, Malvern, UK). To conduct elemental analysis of the BioAg2CO3NPs, biosynthesized by the selected Actinobacteria strain, the X-ray fluorescence (XRF) technique, was employed through a Thermo Scientific Niton\u2122 XL3t 106399 XRF Analyzer (Billerica, MA, USA). The capping and stabilizing agent present in the surface of the BioAg2CO3NPs were analyzed by FTIR in the range of 400\u20134000 cm\u22121 at a resolution of 4 cm\u22121 using Tensor II, Bruker, (Billerica, MA, USA). The morphology of the biosynthesized nanoparticles was determined using scanning electron microscopy (ThermoFisher Scientific, Quattro, (Billerica, MA, USA), as well as the Atomic Force Microscope (AFM).\n3.5.3. Biological Activity Determination of Silver Carbonate Nanoparticles Antimicrobial Activity\nThe agar well diffusion method was used to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of the BioAg2CO3NPs, synthesized using the biomass of the selected strain, against a panel of seven pathogenic microorganisms. However, the serial dilution method in 96-well microtiter plates was applied to determine the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of BioAg2CO3NPs, against the tested microorganisms [74]. After the adjustment of microbial culture turbidity for each tested bacteria and yeast to 0.5 McFarland, the microbial suspension was inoculated onto the surfaces of Muller Hinton and Sabouraud medium, for bacteria and yeast, respectively. Afterward, wells with a diameter of 6 mm, were created in each Petri dish using a sterile cork borer. Subsequently, 20 \u00b5L of silver carbonate nanoparticle solution, prepared at a concentration of 150 \u00b5g/mL,\nMar. Drugs 2023, 21, 536 15 of 19\nwas introduced into each well. The plates were incubated for 24 h at 30\u201337 \u25e6C, following the incubation of plates, the inhibition areas were measured [76]. The minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of BioAg2CO3NPs was determined using the serial dilution method in 96-well microtiter plates. The BioAg2CO3NPs synthesized using the biomass of the selected strain were tested against pathogenic microorganisms at final concentrations ranging from 150 \u00b5g/mL to 1.17 \u00b5g/mL, with distilled water used as the negative control. After incubation, the minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) was determined as the lowest concentration visibly inhibiting the growth of each tested microorganism [77].\nAntibiofilm Activity\nPolystyrene 96-well microtiter plates were used to test the efficiency of BioAg2CO3NPs, prepared from the biomass of the selected strain, to eradicate the 24-h biofilm formed by Klebsiella pneumoniae kp6 strain. The strain used in this experience was isolated from urinary catheter and endotracheal tubes from the services of Intensive Care, Urology, and Neurology, at the University Hospital of Tlemcen. This strain was a high biofilm producer on inert surfaces as described previously by [78]. Each well of the microtiter plate was filled with 200 \u00b5L suspensions of Klebsiella pneumoniae kp6, adjusted to a turbidity of 0.5 McFarland. After incubation for 24 h at 37 \u25e6C, the non-adherent cells were gently removed by washing the biofilms three times with distilled water [79]. Simultaneously, the suspension of BioAg2CO3NPs was prepared at a concentration equivalent to the MIC determined against the Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 70603 strain. Then, 200 \u00b5L of this suspension was added to each well of the microtiter plate. After 24 h of incubation at 37 \u25e6C, the wells were rinsed three times, using distilled water. Afterward, the biofilm was stained with 200 \u00b5L of 0.1% crystal violet for 15 min, washed with tap water to remove excess stain, and then allowed to dry. To quantify microbial adhesion, the stain in the wells was diluted with 200 \u00b5L acetic acid in water (33%), and the absorbance was measured at 595 nm with a microplate reader. Percentages of reduction in biofilm structures were calculated using the formula [79]:\nBio f ilm inhibition (%) = [(OD control \u2212 OD sample) / OD control]\u00d7 100"

            "text": "The present study represents the first attempt at the green synthesis of low-cost and eco-friendly silver carbonate nanoparticles using the biomass of the marine strain Saccharopolyspora erythraea S26, isolated from the Algerian coastline. The synthesized nanoparticles primarily exhibited a triangular morphology, with sizes ranging from 90 to 110 nm. Additionally, the synthesized BioAg2CO3NPs displayed good antibacterial and antibiofilm activity. These findings suggest that BioAg2CO3NPs can serve as an alternative approach to overcome microbial resistance to various antimicrobial agents since microbial resistance toward metallic nanoparticles is extremely rare.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/md21100536/s1, Figure S1: A.
