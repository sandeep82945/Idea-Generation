    "abstractText": "Despite predictions from the Black-White and gender paradoxes in suicide risk, there has been a recent growth in suicide rates among Black women and girls that requires special attention from social and behavioral researchers. In this review, we demonstrate how and why an intersectional framework is needed to understand and contextualize Black women\u2019s mental health and suicide risk. To begin, we outline data and existing literature on Black women\u2019s mental health outcomes. Next, we provide insights from intersectional and Black feminist scholars on the uniqueness of Black womanhood and the necessity of centering racism and sexism in studies of Black women. Third, we present clear links between mental health, gendered racism experienced by Black women, and the Strong Black Woman schema which they adopt to navigate society. Fourth, and finally, we discuss practical and scholarly applications for this work. To this end, this research agenda is about advocating for the consideration of psychosocial and sociocultural factors in practice and research on suicide-related behavior.",

From 1999 to 2019, Black female adolescents and emerging adults, ages 15\u201324, have had rates increase from 2 to 4.5% and Black women, ages 25\u201344, have had rates increase from 2.5 to 4.3% [1]. In fact, as of 2019, suicide is (1) the fourth leading cause of death among Black girls, ages 10\u201314, (2) the third leading cause of death for Black, female emerging adults, ages 15\u201324, and (3) the sixth leading cause of death among Black women ages 25\u201334 [1]. The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) marks mental health concerns like depression and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as factors that heighten suicide risk in the USA [2]. According to the Office of Minority Health [3], Black women have rates of severe psychological distress at 4.7%, compared to a smaller 2.5% among Black men. Additionally, Roberts et\u00a0al. [4] showed that Black women have the highest\nprevalence of PTSD, compared to all intersections of race and gender, at ~ 11%.\nDespite the rise in suicide rates of Black Americans, the overall death rates continue to be lower than other racial and ethnic groups, apart from Black youth under age 13 who are twice as likely to die by suicide compared to their white peers [3, 5]. This patterning is even true when we consider established predictors of suicide risk like educational attainment, economic status, and physical and mental health concerns [1, 6]. The literature refers to this unexpected racial patterning as the Black-White suicide paradox [7]. Thus, creating the illusion of an apparent lack of suicidal behaviors among Black adults [8].\nThere is also a suicide-related paradox across categories of gender. Canetto and Sakinofsky [9] showed that men are overrepresented in suicide statistics in western societies and reported that the gender paradox is a cultural phenomenon found in locations where men and women are expected to use distinct means to attempt suicide. According to Murphy [10], the gender paradox exists because women are protected from suicide risk by engaging in less alcohol use, less impulsive actions, and being taught to be emotive and process their feelings.

Studies of socialization into gender roles show that Black girls are expected to adopt both masculine and feminine gender traits. In Hill\u2019s [11] study of Black families, respondents reported that they were preparing their daughters to be both powerful and submissive, specifically, princesses and warriors. Wallace [12] added that African American girls are allowed to explore tomboy, or masculine identities, under the pretense that they will outgrow them. This complex approach to socialization makes it challenging to theorize the relationships between gender and suicide risk among Black girls. For two, as complex persons with \u201cstrength\u201d at the center of their gender identity, Black women do not have alcohol consumption rates like white women [13], nor do they have the privilege to express emotions freely in social spaces [14].\nBecause established risk factors have not been directly associated with suicide in Black women, social scientists are tasked with asking several questions, \u201cWhy are Black women experiencing an increase in suicide?\u201d and \u201cHow do psychosocial aspects of race and gender put them at risk?\u201d While psychosocial aspects of race and gender could be considered on their own, examining the intersection of Black womanhood is critical in holistically understanding the mental health of Black women [15]. With these changing trends as a backdrop, this paper reports on limitations of existing theories, shifts in Black women\u2019s mental health, and psychosocial determinants of Black women\u2019s mental health and suicide risk established over the last 20\u00a0years. We also introduce a model for use in future studies of Black women\u2019s suicide risk. Our intersectional suicide risk model can be used to conceptualize the pathways and associations between psychosocial risk factors, the Strong Black Woman or Superwoman Schema, and gendered racism on suicide risk and mental health outcomes of Black women. We conclude by suggesting future directions for scholars and practical implications for social workers and mental health practitioners."

            "text": "Research suggests that stress resulting from racial discrimination is associated with trauma and severe psychological symptoms for individuals from racial and ethnic minority groups [16, 17]. Specifically, in the case of Black Americans, racial discrimination is found to produce deleterious mental health outcomes including depression, anxiety, and PTSD [18\u201320]. Several theoretical models exist that create tools for social and behavioral scientists to use in studies of racial stress and suicide risk. One example is Racial Encounter Coping Appraisal and Socialization Theory (RECAST). RECAST is a psychological framework that says personal\nand vicarious experiences with racism affects the stress, coping, and mental health of Black Americans [21]. According to RECAST, racial socialization, or communication around and preparation for racist encounters, serves as an important moderator between discriminatory encounters and coping skills and may buffer against the damaging effect of discriminatory encounters on mental health outcomes including suicide risk [22].\nA second example is the Cultural Model of Suicide (CMOS). Chu et. al [23] provided an important theoretical framework that incorporates the impact of culturally specific factors (i.e., cultural sanctions, idioms of distress, minority stress, and social discord stressors) on suicide thoughts, plans, and attempts (p 11). The CMOS offers a culturally responsive approach to improve suicide assessment, intervention, and prevention. CMOS is guided by the following assumptions: (1) culture influences the expression of suicide-related behavior (i.e., intent, plans, and attempts); (2) culture shapes the meanings of stressors associated with development of suicidal behavior and an individual\u2019s coping capacity; and (3) culture influences types of stressors and strengths that contribute to suicide (p.35). Like RECAST, CMOS is applicable to studies of race-ethnicity but fails to consider the health-related costs of social aspects of gender, thus failing to advance an intersectional identity perspective. Based on the contributions of both RECAST theory and CMOS, it is imperative to consider the application of an intersectional framework in examining mental health outcomes and suicide risk for Black women."

            "text": "The idea that race and gender must be analyzed in tandem is not new when it comes to understanding the psychosocial experiences of Black women. For one, Hooks [24] argued that when gender studies ignore the lived experiences of Black women, they are void of the total magnitude of gender oppression and how detrimental it can be when experienced alongside racism. For two, Davis [25] added that gender studies centering women\u2019s oppression within family settings ignore the work-related oppression faced by Black and Brown women. Finally, Collins [26], called for a line of research focused on centering Black women called Black Feminist Thought. She contended that Black women have a history that is too distinct from Black men and non-Black women to be measured in conjunction with them. In fact, she argued that Black women\u2019s standing in a racist and sexist country leaves them silenced, looked over, denied rights, and often violated.\n84\nJournal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities (2023) 10:83\u201392\n1 3\nFrom this line of theory comes intersectionality. Intersectionality is a framework which can be used to analyze how intersecting oppressions such as race, ethnicity, and gender manifest simultaneously in the lives of individuals from marginalized subpopulations, like Black women [26, 27]. According to Collins [28], intersectional research is that which, \u201creferences the critical insight that race, class, gender, sexuality, ethnicity, nation, ability and age, operate not as unitary, mutually exclusive entities, but as reciprocally constructing phenomena that in turn shape complex social inequalities\u201d (p.2).\nIn her review of intersectional studies, Collins [28] claimed that the use of intersectional theory can improve studies of marginalized populations in several notable ways, several examples follow. One potential application is rethinking existing frames. Not only is rhetoric around suicide racialized, but it is also gendered as well. This is problematic because as the respondents in Spates [29] study reported, \u201csuicide and whiteness were synonymous, just as strength and blackness were\u201d (p. 14). Scholars of suicide risk have largely been concerned with uncovering the impact of masculine gender orientation [30, 31] or how the BlackWhite paradox may be a result of Black American suicide being misrecognized by medical examiners [7]. Epidemiological outcomes, however, show that mental health-related concerns are racialized, class specific, and gendered; so, the dominant literature that puts women who belong to racial minority groups in the periphery is missing the social determinants of health among non-hegemonic individuals [28]. A second potential application would be intersectionality\u2019s ability to examine and find new solutions for existing social problems. According to Collins [28], solutions to violence against women \u201cremain unlikely if\u2026imagined through mono-categorical lenses such as gender\u2026or racial\u201d (p. 12). The same applies to mental health and suicide-related behavior. A third, and final, application for intersectionality is the ability to study identity. Collins [28] claims that studies of identity provide insight into group solidarity that forms because of specific identity types. Perhaps if Black women are made aware of their shared mental health concerns, they could form solidarity then work together to redefine how they navigate their social worlds [29\u201331].\nThe Vance\u2011Wade Intersectional Suicide Risk Model\nFor this review, we consider three aspects of identity: race, gender, and mental health status. According to GarlandThomson [32], disability labels, such as depressed or suicidal, allow us to (1) interpret (or analyze) and discipline (or criticize) divergent or \u201cunhealthy\u201d individuals; (2) understand the relationship between a person and their environment, in this case the psychological strain of navigating the social world as a Black woman; (3) uncover\npractices that produce able and disabled people, or learn ways gendered racism promotes stress and other psychological concerns; and (4) describe how inherently unstable the able person is, by seeing how omnirelevant race and gender are and how quickly situations can become psychologically triggering for even the healthiest Black women. Intersectionality scholars [27, 33] assert that exploring intersecting identities and their association with lived experiences and health concerns in research should occur simultaneously, namely, by using measures that capture the co-occurring racist and sexist experiences of Black women. We agree with the scholars from the fields of law, sociology, public health, and gender studies in the preferred intersectional approach when studying the psychosocial costs of racism and sexism among Black women, thus, allowing for a simultaneous exploration of how unhealthy Black women are interpreted, compared to healthy people, non-Black people, and males.\nAn intersectional analysis allows us to center Black women\u2019s stories as we consider the ways in which racism and gender-based oppression shapes their mental health outcomes and suicide risk. Although Black women remain understudied, there are several noteworthy studies of mental health outcomes that use intersectional frameworks. This budding research has demonstrated differential outcomes for individuals based on their intersecting identities of race, gender, and sexual minority status. For example, when examining outcomes for suicidal ideation, Baiden et. al [34] found that Black (at 1.2 \u00d7) and Native American (at 2.44 \u00d7) bisexual adolescents had higher odds of suicide attempts when compared to their white American counterparts. Additionally, Ferlatte et. al. [35] demonstrated differential protective and risk factors for suicide for sexual minority men based on their socioeconomic status, education, and race/ethnicity. A study conducted by Lewis et. al [15] examined more closely the influence of gendered racism on physical and mental health outcomes specifically for Black women. Findings revealed that there was a significant relationship between gendered microaggressions and psychological stress. The findings from these studies represent the importance of centering intersecting identities in understanding risk for suicide outcomes and the development of preventative measures.\nThe Vance-Wade Intersectional Suicide Risk Model extends Lewis et\u00a0al.\u2019s [15] social psychological model by proposing a psycho-socio cultural model to guide scientific inquiry that centers the interconnectedness of social aspects of race and gender on suicide risk for Black women. This model accounts for systemic factors of racism, sexism, and dehumanization, wherein specific risk factors (i.e., gendered and racist experiences, Strong Black Woman, or Superwoman Schema, and psychosocial risk factors) create racialized gendered stress that can negatively impact mental health (i.e., depression, anxiety, and PTSD) and exacerbate\n85\nJournal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities (2023) 10:83\u201392\n1 3\nestablished mental health related predictors of suicide risk (Fig.\u00a01).\nThe following sections address psychosocial and sociocultural factors that create heightened levels of suicide risk for Black women. The final sections of the review will highlight trends in psychological outcomes that relate to social determinants of Black women\u2019s health."

These approaches frame experiences of racism and sexism separately, thus excluding the concurrent impact and complexity of these intersectional oppressions. What Black women experience as both racial and gender minorities is referred to as gendered racism [36]. Among women, for example, there are distinct sexist typologies by race. Specifically, the social construction of (1) White womanhood is a blend of passivity and confidence that promotes the reproduction of male dominance and white supremacy, (2) Black womanhood is constructed as unfeminine and too aggressive, and (3) Asian womanhood is constructed as overly passive and sexually exotic [28, 37, 38]. This means that Black women of all ages are subject to fear and aggression in social spaces as responses to their presumed nature. Gendered racism consists of race-based prejudice, harassment, and violence experienced by Black women [33]. These intersecting oppressive actions create chronic psychological stress which relates to negative mental health outcomes, such as depressive symptoms and anxiety [8, 15, 38\u201340].\nThe arrest of Sandra Bland provides an anecdotal example of the gendered racism Black women face in America. According to the viral video footage, Sandra Bland was brutally assaulted during a routine traffic stop. During the assault, Bland repeatedly called the arresting officer names\nand asked him if hitting a woman made him \u201cfeel like a man.\u201d Bland was visibly enraged by this gender rule violation. As Collins [28] asserted, \u201cGender rules typically remain invisible until someone violates them.\u201d The problem was that gender rules are racialized, and roles are carried out in a racist society. As such, it is highly plausible that the arresting officer did not perceive Black women as worthy of physical restraint or chivalry. The socio-historical depiction and perceived place for Black women has been \u201cthe help,\u201d people who are only expected to \u201csmile\u201d and keep quiet. Sandra Bland\u2019s knowledge of her rights, and willingness to express how infuriated she felt, seemingly resulted in the officer feeling like she violated racialized gender rules, thus, requiring him to use violence to reclaim his perceived place of authority [28]."

Black women\u2019s lived experiences are shaped by the racism and sexism that structures western society. This translates to inferior treatment and structural disadvantages in spaces like professional, academic, and medical settings. These sociological challenges are different for Black women compared to the way other populations may experience similar issues. For example, Black women face stereotypes of ignorance and biological inferiority in medical settings [41] and they seek counsel from mental health professionals who have often been trained using racist practices [40, 42]. Existing research has documented psychosocial predictors of mental health outcomes relevant specifically to Black women (i.e., stress, stigma related to image, and gendered racism [43]), which reflect the history and positioning of their identity within society. These factors may not only influence suicide outcomes directly, but also indirectly by way of increased levels of stress, depression, and anxiety.\n86\nJournal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities (2023) 10:83\u201392\n1 3\nOther psychosocial factors that create suicide risk for Black women are documented in the literature as well. Gibbs [44] reported risk factors for Black Americans related to suicidal behavior. Risks that applied to Black women included early adulthood (as suicide rates are highest from 25 to 34), substance use, depression, and family or interpersonal conflict (for youth and women in particular). Manetta [45] examined suicide risk among Black women and found that rates were highest among those who experience child abuse, with rates being even higher among victims of childhood sexual abuse. She argued that the loss of control they experience of their own body as a child may be enticed by sense of control tied to suicide behaviors."

            "text": "Navigating a raced and gendered hierarchy is especially challenging for Black women. As such, they have adapted to the Strong Black Woman (SBW) script to appear unbothered and mentally strong [46] as well as resilient and independent in the face of severe hardships [47]. This script can have effects on coping behaviors and the overall health of Black women [48]. Relatedly, qualitative research highlights Black women who refer to themselves as \u201csuperwomen\u201d and \u201cStrong Black Women\u201d within multiple mainstream settings [46, 49]. According to the Giscombe Superwoman Schema [50], Black women\u2019s gender roles include an obligation to express strength, suppress emotions, resist vulnerability or dependence, succeed despite having limited resources, and to prioritize care for others over self-care.\nMany Black women report having preconceived notions, deriving from childhood, to take on features of the SBW schema [50]. In doing so, Black women are less likely to be vulnerable or ask for help, support, or assistance from their counterparts for fear of being perceived as weak [49, 51]. A major cost related to \u201cacting\u201d strong is the damage it does to the emotional, physical, and spiritual health of Black women [46]. Specifically, the pursuit of strength at the cost of emotional expression has been linked to multiple negative psychological outcomes for Black women such as depression [52], anxiety [53], and even suicidal ideation and suicide attempts [50].\nAs \u201cactors,\u201d Black women are often pushed to unhealthy coping behaviors. Beauboeuf-Lafontant [54] reported that Black women have been constructed as strong and large since the mammy typology of colonial America. She contended that today\u2019s Black women continue to convey being large and strong by using unhealthy diets to cope with the negative emotions they experience but are unable to express in public spaces. Additionally, in their study of college-aged Black women, Diggins et\u00a0al. [52] reported finding a relationship between perceived stress, contextual stress, and eating behaviors. Finally, in her studies of race, sex, and\ngender orientation as predictors of engagement in health risk behaviors, Wade [53, 55] found that (1) Black women had higher scores on the masculinity scale when compared to their Black male, white female, and white male age mates, and (2) that higher scores on the masculinity scale predicted frequent fast-food consumption and heavy episodic drinking behavior. This is relevant to the study of Strong Black Women as Wade used the Bem Sex Role Inventory to capture gender orientation. The Bem Sex Role Inventory conceptualizes \u201cmasculinity\u201d as subscription to traits like independence, assertiveness, and self-reliance, which are commonly associated with \u201cstrength,\u201d not masculinity, among Black women [53, 55]. This means that it is likely that the two are conflicted when referring to gender traits or roles, which are social psychological aspects of gender that vary by race."

Primary stressors among Black women are defined as (1) episodes of stress that stem from subtle social experiences related to racial discrimination; (2) various forms of racial microaggressions, or brief, daily acts that diminish or display hatred towards race groups [56]; and (3) the presence of institutional discrimination whereby Black women have limited access to opportunities and are forced to navigate inequities [57, 58]. Research emphasizes the ways in which social stressors which derive from historical and cultural experiences reflect the lives of Black women. Importantly, these stressors are different for their Black male counterparts as well as white men and women [59].\nAccording to their analysis, Turner and Avison [60] found that not only do Black Americans face stressors more frequently, but Black women of varied class statuses also reported the greatest level of stress throughout life events. Davidson et\u00a0al. [60] attributed Black women\u2019s acute and chronic stress to environmental stimuli. Notably, the impact of these environmental factors was mediated by the impact of psychological factors including type A behavior, cynical hostility, neuroticism, self-esteem, obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder, hardiness, perceived control, and anger expression/suppression. There is still limited research on the impact of mental health outcomes due to racialized gender stress among Black women. This is an area that must be further explored and would benefit from drawing on\n87\nJournal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities (2023) 10:83\u201392\n1 3\nour intersectional model to account for interconnected risk factors (i.e., experiences of gendered racism) on racialized gender stress and previous studies that have examined the relationship between minority stress (i.e., discrimination and prejudice experiences, fear of stigma, and internalized attitudes) and subsequent risk factors for understanding transgender populations\u2019 experiences with mental health, and suicide risk [60, 61]."

In 2014, the percentages of non-Hispanic Black women (ages 18 +) who reported experiencing sadness, hopelessness, and worthlessness was significantly greater than those reported by nonHispanic white women [58]. This finding calls on researchers to examine the factors influencing the development of depression for Black women. Upon examining the impact of racist events, sexual objectification, and gendered racism on depressive outcomes, Carr et\u00a0al. [63] found that racist events had a direct impact on depression, whether they were internalized or not, and that sexual objectification had an indirect impact on depression when it was internalized. Interestingly, however, gendered racism did not show a direct effect on depression. This finding still supports the intersectional argument as Black women are simultaneously exposed to sexual objectification and racist events. Moreover, poverty, poor physical and mental health care, and stigmatization of mental illness are common factors that contribute to higher rates of anxiety in Black women [64]. More recently, Erving, Thomas, and Frazier [65] conducted an analysis of the Black-White paradox to see if it held when controlling for gender. Their findings showed that Black Americans had higher rates of PTSD than white Americans and that Black women were 34% more likely to experience PTSD when compared to their white female counterparts."

Gendered racism has been found to have negative mental health related consequences, including low self-esteem, increased psychological distress, anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress symptoms [39, 69\u201374].\nDespite the presence of these critical associations, very few studies have examined the impact of gendered racism on suicide-related behavior. Castle et\u00a0al. [72] found that exposure to stressors is disproportionately higher among Black women which creates a greater risk for suicide ideation and attempts among this population. To our knowledge, only two\nsuch studies exist [61, 62]. Results from both studies demonstrated a significant relationship between gendered racism and suicidal ideation/behaviors for Black women. Specifically, these relationships were significant for Black women with darker skin color [62] and with high and low levels of well-being, self-esteem, and active coping [61].\nAlthough little research has examined intersectional risk factors for Black women, they have the highest incidence of medically treated suicide attempts (i.e., those with consequences severe enough to require medical intervention) among all race/gender subgroups [54]. Additionally, several studies have found that the rate of self-injury was highest for young Black girls [74, 75]. Moreover, Black women with a history of repeat suicide attempts have an elevated risk for suicide [76]. These findings demonstrate an urgent need to better understand the conditions which lead to suicide outcomes for this group.\nThere is much uncertainty about the risk factors associated with depression and anxiety among Black women. This is largely because this population is particularly understudied [31]. Each of the areas above can be understood separately, but the intersection between race and gender is arguably more important. For example, several factors that uniquely influence mental health outcomes for Black women are the \u201cStrong-Black Woman\u201d (SBW) script and gendered racism."

Examining the role of gendered racism on mental health outcomes of Black women, especially suicide-related behavior, is one area for transformational research. The notion that Black women are at a decreased risk of suicide is no longer viable considering the current trends which indicate this group is increasingly vulnerable. Specifically, it is imperative for scholars interested in studying suicide among Black women to apply an intersectionality framework to best understand the intersecting gendered and racial risk factors for negative mental health outcomes and suicide risk.\nNotably, one intersecting factor, gendered racism, appears to contribute significantly to adverse mental health outcomes such as depression, stress, anxiety, and suiciderelated behavior for Black women. It is critical to explore this construct as a risk factor to best target interventions and preventative initiatives to this unique population. Additionally, practitioners and researchers alike should consider the response to such stressors among Black women who often are expected to suppress their negative emotional expression to maintain the SBW script and demonstrate resilience. This coping strategy has demonstrated a significant relationship\n88\nJournal of Racial and Ethnic Health Disparities (2023) 10:83\u201392\n1 3\nwith negative psychological outcomes, including suicide, and therefore should be addressed and targeted in interventions for this group.\nAdditionally, there is a need for practitioners to understand the benefits of integrating intersectionality in their practice [77, 78]. For instance, practitioners employing an intersectional approach during assessment (i.e., asking questions that do not ignore lived experiences of multiple identities) allow for more rapport building and improve overall case conceptualization. Critical to an intersectional analysis of suicide risk for Black women is an understanding of their intersecting identities and the multiple, marginalized oppressions they face. The most common current assessment measures for suicide risk, such as the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale [79], do not consider factors such as race, gender identity, and other cultural variations [23]. Without accounting for these variations, identification of Black women at greatest risk of suicide may be undetected. Incorporating screening measures, such as the Cultural Assessment of Risk for Suicide, should be used as a best practice in assessing for suicide risk and properly managing interventions for diverse populations, especially Black women [80]. Finally, interventions should be tailored to the unique experience of Black women to best and most effectively address both existing suicide related behaviors and mental health concerns, such as depression, anxiety, and PTSD which leave Black women more vulnerable to the development of suicidal outcomes. While currently there are a few interventions that have been developed with Black women in mind, these are largely targeted at specific subgroups such as those who are low-income [81] and those who have experienced domestic violence and childhood abuse [82]. Both interventions used group-based treatment approaches guided by the efficacy of group therapy in fostering support networks, promoting a sense of community through shared experiences, and empowering individuals to better navigate their reality [83]. One intervention, The Grady Nia project, used a 10-week group model, guided by Afrocentric and Black Womanism theories, to center race and gender oppression experiences of African American women regarding interpersonal violence and suicide behavior [81]. Although these interventions are useful and important, a broader application of intersectionality in clinical settings will enable all Black women to benefit greatly from culturally responsive services."
