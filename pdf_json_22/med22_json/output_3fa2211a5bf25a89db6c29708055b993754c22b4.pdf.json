Targeted gene editing has the potential to overcome these limitations and enhance T\u00a0cell therapeutic function3\u201310. Here we performed multiple genome-wide CRISPR knock-out screens under different immunosuppressive conditions to identify genes that can be targeted to prevent T\u00a0cell dysfunction. These screens converged on RASA2, a RAS GTPase-activating protein (RasGAP) that we identify as a signalling checkpoint in human T\u00a0cells, which is downregulated upon acute T\u00a0cell receptor stimulation\u00a0and\u00a0can increase gradually with chronic antigen exposure. RASA2 ablation enhanced MAPK signalling and chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T\u00a0cell cytolytic activity in response to target antigen. Repeated tumour antigen stimulations in\u00a0vitro revealed that RASA2-deficient T\u00a0cells show increased activation, cytokine production and metabolic activity compared with control cells, and show a marked advantage in persistent cancer cell killing. RASA2-knockout CAR T\u00a0cells had a competitive fitness advantage over control cells in the\u00a0bone marrow in a mouse model of leukaemia. Ablation of RASA2 in multiple preclinical models of T\u00a0cell receptor and CAR T\u00a0cell therapies prolonged survival in mice xenografted with either liquid or solid tumours. Together, our findings highlight RASA2 as a promising target to enhance both persistence and effector function in T\u00a0cell therapies for cancer treatment.\nCAR T\u00a0cells have been transformative in a subset of aggressive haematological malignancies, and T\u00a0cell receptor (TCR)-transgenic T\u00a0cells (TCR T\u00a0cells) have shown promising results in early-phase clinical studies for solid tumours1. However, many cancers, especially solid tumours, do not respond to current T\u00a0cell therapies or rapidly progress after the initial response. Within the tumour mass, the immunosuppressive microenvironment poses a substantial barrier to the efficacy of anti-tumour immunity2,11. In addition, persistent exposure to antigen can lead to T\u00a0cell dysfunction, highlighting the need to balance effector function and long-term persistence in engineered T\u00a0cells3,12. Targeted manipulation of select genes is being tested as a strategy to boost the efficacy of adoptive T\u00a0cell therapies5\u20137. However, the optimal gene targets in human T\u00a0cells have not been explored systematically. Large-scale CRISPR screens can accelerate the discovery of genetic perturbations that can boost the efficacy of engineered T\u00a0cells3,8\u201310. We previously developed a discovery platform in primary human T\u00a0cells and applied it to identify novel genetic regulators of T\u00a0cell proliferation13. Here we describe unbiased genetic screens performed under several immunosuppressive conditions commonly encountered in the tumour microenvironment (TME) that uncovered ablation of the RASA2 gene as a strategy for T\u00a0cells to overcome multiple inhibitory cues. We find that ablation of RASA2 enhances sensitivity to antigen and improves\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-022-05126-w\nReceived: 31 July 2021\nAccepted: 20 July 2022"

Finally, we show that RASA2-ablation in antigen-specific T\u00a0cells can enhance tumour control and extend survival in multiple preclinical models of liquid and solid tumours.\nCRISPR screens converge on RASA2 The suppressive TME and T\u00a0cell intrinsic checkpoints can impinge on the efficacy of engineered T\u00a0cells targeting solid tumours14. We developed a systematic approach to identify genetic perturbations that could render T\u00a0cells resistant to a range of inhibitory signals encountered in the TME. We previously used CGS-21680, an adenosine agonist13, to simulate elevated adenosine A2A inhibitory signalling in response to high levels of adenosine in the hypoxic TME15. Here we extended this strategy to model multiple challenges to T\u00a0cell function in the TME. To model intrinsic checkpoint signals, we focused on inhibitors of calcium and calcineurin signaling (tacrolimus and cyclosporine), which is a critical pathway for T\u00a0cell activation that is frequently suppressed in tumour-infiltrating T\u00a0cells16. To mimic a prominent extrinsic inhibitory signal in the TME, we used TGF\u03b2, a canonical suppressive cytokine that limits T\u00a0cell function within tumours17. Finally, as T regulatory cells (Treg cells) are important mediators of T\u00a0cell dysfunction in multiple tumour types18, we adapted our screening platform to assay cell\u2013cell interactions and thereby reveal genes that confer resistance to suppression of effector T\u00a0cells by Treg cells.\nTo identify regulators of resistance to these suppressive conditions, we applied single guide RNA (sgRNA) lentiviral infection with Cas9 electroporation (SLICE) of pooled genome-wide CRISPR-knockout (KO) screens in primary human T\u00a0cells13. Here, we analysed a total of six different genome-wide screens in primary human T\u00a0cells across multiple independent donors and suppressive conditions (Fig.\u00a01a). In each of these conditions, we identified gene targets that promoted T\u00a0cell proliferation by flow cytometry-based cell sorting to identify sgRNAs enriched in the dividing cells (low carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE) staining) over those in non-dividing cells (high CFSE staining) after the cells were re-stimulated. As expected, guides targeting essential genes were depleted in highly dividing cells compared with non-dividing cells across screen conditions, and gene hits were correlated with higher expression in human T\u00a0cells19,20 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01a,b). Analysis of gene hits enriched in the highly dividing compared with non-dividing cells that were shared between all screens converged on two candidate resistance target genes: TMEM222 and RASA2 (Fig.\u00a01b, Extended Data Fig.\u00a01c and Supplementary Table\u00a01). Cross-comparison of screen hits highlighted the extent of shared hits between screens performed with similar suppressive cues (for example, tacrolimus and cyclosporine) (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01d). Comparative analysis of the sgRNAs in highly dividing cells across screens nominated hits selective for each suppressive condition, as well as those conferring more general resistance profiles for additional validation (Supplementary Table\u00a02). A subset of gene hits was more specific for individual screens\u2014for example, ADORA2A and TGFBR1 scored highly in the adenosine and TGF\u03b2 conditions, respectively (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01e). Arrayed validation of selected genes by CRISPR-mediated knockout confirmed the potential of these unbiased screens to discover novel regulators of T\u00a0cell resistance to TME-related suppressive cues (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01e and Supplementary Table\u00a03). For example, targeting PDE4C or NKX2-6 rendered T\u00a0cells resistant to adenosine suppression, whereas NFKB2 KO conferred resistance to the calcineurin inhibitors tacrolimus and cyclosporine. Notably, we observed cross-talk between hits for TGF\u03b2 and those for adenosine resistance, supporting previously described interplay between these immunosuppressive signals21,22. We validated other gene targets as conferring resistance across suppressive conditions, such as PFN1, FAM49B (also known as CYRIB), CBLB and RASA2. Although published data support the roles of CBLB, FAM49B and PFN1\nin regulating T\u00a0cell function, to our knowledge, RASA2 has not been previously well-defined as a regulator of immune cells8,13,23.\nWe previously identified RASA2 as a gene target that boosts T\u00a0cell proliferation and in\u00a0vitro cancer cell-killing capacity when it is knocked out13. Having observed that RASA2 ablation also promotes T\u00a0cell proliferative capacity under multiple immunosuppressive environments, we focused our subsequent efforts on characterizing the effects of RASA2 ablation in preclinical models of adoptive cell therapy. RASA2 is a RasGAP that suppresses RAS signal output by accelerating the hydrolysis of active RAS-GTP to RAS-GDP24,25. In these screens, RASA2 was unique among the RasGAP family in inhibiting T\u00a0cell proliferation as evidenced by multiple RASA2-targeting guides in multiple donors being enriched in the dividing T\u00a0cells (Fig.\u00a01c,d and Extended Data Fig.\u00a01g). By contrast, guides targeting the gene encoding the RAS guanine nucleotide exchange factor (RasGEF) RASGRP1 were depleted from dividing T\u00a0cells, confirming its known role as a positive regulator of TCR and RAS signaling26 (Fig.\u00a01d). Analysis of global gene expression patterns across tissues27 showed that RASA2 is expressed selectively\u00a0in CD8+ and CD4+ human T\u00a0cells, a pattern distinct from other RasGAP family members but very similar to that observed for the RASGRP126 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a01h). Targeted RASA2 ablation with individual CRISPR guides in two additional donors reproduced the proliferative advantage observed in the screens under all four soluble-factor suppressive conditions (Fig.\u00a01e and Extended Data Fig.\u00a02a\u2013d).\nWe further tested whether RASA2-deficient T\u00a0cells exhibit increased in\u00a0vitro killing of cancer cells under these immunosuppressive conditions. RASA2 ablation boosted cancer cell killing by TCR T\u00a0cells compared with control-edited T\u00a0cells across this range of suppressive conditions (Fig.\u00a01f and Extended Data Fig.\u00a02e). A co-culture suppression assay with Treg cells further confirmed that RASA2 inactivation renders effector T\u00a0cells resistant to Treg cell-mediated inhibition of proliferation (Fig.\u00a01g and Extended Data Fig.\u00a02f). This resistance to suppression was also evident in cancer cell-killing assays performed in the presence of Treg cells (Fig.\u00a01h and Extended Data Fig.\u00a02g,h). Whereas RASA2-deficient effector T\u00a0cells maintained their robust cytotoxic function, control T\u00a0cells were unable to control tumour cell growth in the presence of suppressive Treg cells. These findings support the idea that RASA2 normally serves as a negative regulator of T\u00a0cell proliferation and cytotoxic function and that RASA2 ablation confers resistance to multiple mechanisms that suppress the anti-tumour activity of adoptive T\u00a0cells.\nRASA2 regulates TCR-dependent RAS signalling We next sought to define the effects of inactivating RASA2 on RAS-GTP levels and downstream signaling events in human T\u00a0cells. RASA2 is predicted to attenuate RAS signalling, a major intersection for multiple pathways in T\u00a0cells that control cell activation, proliferation and differentiation28,29 (Fig.\u00a02a). The Jurkat T\u00a0cell leukaemia cell line and primary human T\u00a0cells express normal RAS proteins, and as expected in cells lacking an oncogenic RAS mutation30, basal RAS-GTP levels were low in both cell types but increased in response to TCR stimulation (Fig.\u00a02b and Extended Data Fig.\u00a03a). We found that knocking out RASA2 resulted in higher RAS-GTP levels in response to TCR stimulation, in agreement with its known function as a GTPase-activating protein for RAS. These biochemical data are consistent with the results of our CRISPR screens, which support a non-redundant role of RASA2 in regulating RAS output in T\u00a0cells that is not rescued by other GTPase-activating proteins. MEK and ERK are key downstream effectors of RAS-GTP in the MAPK signalling pathway29. Consistent with the increased levels of RAS-GTP upon TCR activation, we observed higher levels of MEK and ERK phosphorylation in the RASA2-KO primary T\u00a0cells compared with corresponding controls. Although RASA2-KO T\u00a0cells followed similar overall kinetics of MAPK signalling as control cells, they reached a higher peak amplitude of phosphorylated (p)\n176 | Nature | Vol 609 | 1 September 2022"

            "text": "ERK and pMEK levels (Fig.\u00a02c and Extended Data Fig.\u00a03b,c). RASA2-KO T\u00a0cells also had higher levels of stimulation-induced phosphorylation of S6, a further downstream mediator of the MAPK signalling cascade (Fig.\u00a02d and Extended Data Fig.\u00a03d,e). Together, these data support a role for RASA2 as a RasGAP regulating the MAPK signalling response to TCR stimulation.\nWe also confirmed that RASA2 ablation does not cause unregulated T\u00a0cell proliferation, which might reduce its utility as a target for gene editing in T\u00a0cell therapies. In the absence of TCR stimulation, the viability of both control and RASA2-KO T\u00a0cells steadily declined, and withdrawal of interleukin-2 (IL-2) enhanced this decline (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03f). We found that RASA2-KO T\u00a0cells remain dependent on TCR stimulation for MAPK signalling (indicated by pERK), proliferation (indicated by CFSE staining) and activation (indicated by CD69 expression), with no consistent change in baseline levels, except for CD69 which showed variable expression13 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a03g). Additionally, we detected higher levels of multiple effector cytokines in RASA2-deficient T\u00a0cells compared with control T\u00a0cells in response to TCR stimulation, with no differences noted in the unstimulated cells (Fig.\u00a02e and Extended Data Fig.\u00a04a). Together, these results demonstrate that in TCR stimulated T\u00a0cells, RASA2 ablation boosts a cascade of key signalling pathways to promote more potent effector functions. Notably, RASA2 ablation does not cause loss of cytokine dependence or unregulated proliferation in the absence of TCR stimulation. RASA2 ablation sensitizes T\u00a0cells to antigen We next tested whether ablating RASA2 in T\u00a0cells amplifies sensitivity to lower levels of target cognate antigen in\u00a0vitro. RASA2-KO T\u00a0cells had higher levels of ERK phosphorylation, activation and proliferation compared with control T\u00a0cells across a wide range of concentrations of anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 (anti-CD3/CD28) (Fig.\u00a02f and Extended Data Fig.\u00a04b). To measure this antigen sensitivity with a more physiological stimulus, NY-ESO-1 antigen-specific T\u00a0cells were co-cultured with T2 cells preloaded with increasing concentrations of the cognate NY-ESO-1 peptide. This assay confirmed that RASA2 KO led to higher levels of pERK across a range of peptide concentrations, effectively sensitizing T\u00a0cells to antigen (Fig.\u00a02g). Increased antigen sensitivity could be particularly important in engineering T\u00a0cells that are able to detect and kill cancer cells with low target-antigen expression31,32. To test this, we engineered T\u00a0cells to express a CAR targeting the CD19 surface protein and edited them to disrupt either RASA2 or a control locus (Extended Data Fig.\u00a04c,d and Methods). We used a CD28-based CD19 CAR, which has been reported to be a highly\u00a0sensitive CAR, to test whether loss of RASA2 expression might further boost sensitivity to low-antigen targets with RASA2 ablation33. These CAR T\u00a0cells were co-cultured with cancer cells engineered to express a range of CD19 levels and cancer cell killing was assayed by annexin staining. Whereas both RASA2-KO and control CAR T\u00a0cells efficiently killed leukaemia cells expressing high CD19 levels, RASA2 inactivation augmented the in\u00a0vitro killing\na b\nlog2FC\nc\nCFSE\ne Adenosine Cyclosporine Tacrolimus TGF\u03b2\nAdenosine Cyclosporine Tacrolimus TGF\u03b2f\ng\nTreg:CD8 +\n0:1 1:1 2:1 4:1\nCtrl RASA2 KO\n1\n0 24 48 72 0 24 48 72\n2\n3\n4\nTime (h)\nC an\nce r\nce ll\ngr ow\nth\nh\nAdenosine Cyclosporine Tacrolimus\nTGF\u03b2 Treg\n+ TCR stimulation\nEdited T cells N on -d iv id\nin g\nDi vi\ndi ng\nSort by CFSE\nRASA2 RASAL1 RASA4 RASAL2 RASA3 RASAL3 RASA1\nNF1 RASGRP1\nRASA2 TMEM222\n0\n10\n20\nTreg\nTGF\u03b2 Tacrolimus\nCyclosporine Adenosine\nStim\nN um\nb er\no f s\nha re\nd h\nits\nStim Adenosine Cyclosporine Tacrolimus\nTGF\u03b2 Treg\nd RASA2\nNon-dividing Dividing\nCBLB CDKN1B\nCYC1 DGKA\nFAM49B\nSOCS1 TGFBR1 TNFAIP3\nTNS2 UBE2F\n*****\n**\n0\n5,000\n10,000\n15,000\n20,000\n1:2 1:8 1:16 Treg:CD8 + ratio\nC D\n8+ c\nou nt\n1:1 1:2 1:4 1:1 1:2 1:4 1:1 1:2 1:4 1:1 1:2 1:4 0\n100 200 300 400\nE:T ratio\nA U\nC\n\u22122 \u22121 0 1 2\nRASA2 KO Ctrl\nRASA2 KO Ctrl\nRASA2 KO Ctrl\nFig. 1 | Multiple genome-wide CRISPR screens in primary human T\u00a0cells identify RASA2 as a modulator of resistance to immunosuppressive conditions. a, Schematic of genome-wide screens for resistance gene targets in human T\u00a0cells. b, Top shared gene hits (z-score >1.5) between 5 (blue) and all 6 (pink) of the screens are labelled.

            "text": "We next profiled downstream transcriptional networks in RASA2-KO cells. First, to assess transcriptional programmes key to T\u00a0cell activation, we used a set of Jurkat T\u00a0cell transcriptional reporter systems. These reporter lines have been engineered with response elements for activator protein 1 (AP-1), nuclear factor of activated T\u00a0cells (NFAT) and nuclear factor kappa B (NF\u043aB) driving the expression of an mCherry fluorescent reporter. These studies showed that RASA2 ablation significantly increased TCR stimulation-induced transcriptional activity of AP-1 and NF\u043aB, and to a lesser extent NFAT, consistent with the established downstream transcriptional effects of RAS and MAPK signalling pathways (Fig.\u00a02i and Extended Data Fig.\u00a05a). To profile transcriptional changes systematically in primary RASA2-KO T\u00a0cells, we performed whole transcriptome RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis on either RASA2-KO or control edited antigen-specific T\u00a0cells after 48 h of co-culture with target cancer cells. Two of the most upregulated genes in RASA2-KO T\u00a0cells were DUSP6 and SPRED2, which attenuate RAS signalling and are probably upregulated as a feedback mechanism in response to increased RAS signalling34 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05b). Gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA) highlighted multiple key pathways that are upregulated in RASA2-KO T\u00a0cells, including those associated with cell cycle, transcriptional activity and cell metabolism (Fig.\u00a02j). Notably, given the importance of metabolic state to T\u00a0cell function, RASA2-deficient T\u00a0cells showed increased expression of genes involved in oxidative phosphorylation and glycolysis (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05c,d). To test whether these metabolic changes are generally common to hyper-activated T\u00a0cells, we analysed a single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) dataset that we generated previously in CRISPR-perturbed primary human T\u00a0cells13. We compared genes that were differentially expressed in RASA2-KO T\u00a0cells with those in T\u00a0cells lacking CBLB, which encodes a well-characterized negative regulator of TCR signalling. Whereas inactivation of RASA2 or CBLB increased levels of GZMB, MKI67 and CDKN3 and decreased expression of SELL and TCF7 (Fig.\u00a02k), our analysis\ni j\na c\ne\n\u20132 2 40\nExpression\nCells (%)\n60%\n70%\n80%\nk\n0 24 48\nf\ng\nTime (h)\nC an\nce r\nce ll\nki lli\nng\nh\nMYC targets V1 E2F targets mTORC1 signalling MYC targets V2\nG2M checkpoint Unfolded protein resp.\nUV resp. up Oxidative phospho.\nHedgehog signalling Spermatogenesis Fatty acid metabolism Adipogenesis\nDNA repair Glycolysis IFN\u03b3 resp.

            "text": "revealed that ablation of RASA2 also induced a unique gene signature. This signature included differential expression of core genes involved in mitochondrial activity, such as MRPL12, TOMM40, TFAM and UCP235,36. Metabolic regulation by RASA2 was underscored by a strong negative correlation between genes driving oxidative phosphorylation and RASA2 expression across thousands of transcriptional datasets from immune cells (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05e,f and Methods). Overall, our analysis of the transcriptional state of RASA2 KO T\u00a0cells revealed a heightened effector memory state (that is, decreased TCF7 and SELL expression) coupled with a higher oxidative phosphorylation state, which is typically associated with central memory T\u00a0cells37.\nAs\u2014to our knowledge\u2014RASA2 has no previously described roles in T\u00a0cell biology, we next evaluated its endogenous transcriptional regulation in T\u00a0cells. Analysis of our previously published scRNA-seq dataset13 revealed that RASA2 is downregulated following stimulation in human T\u00a0cells (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05g). Further analysis of two published RNA-seq datasets of acute bacterial infection in mice38 and a large cohort of in\u00a0vitro activated human T\u00a0cells20 confirmed that T\u00a0cell stimulation acutely downregulates RASA2 expression levels (Fig.\u00a02l,m). This acute endogenous reduction of RASA2 after stimulation may give T\u00a0cells a window of heightened effector function, and genetic ablation of RASA2 may amplify this phenomenon through complete and enduring loss of RASA2. Additionally, we tested whether RASA2 may have a role in T\u00a0cell dysfunction through analysis of external datasets. Consistent with a checkpoint role in regulating T\u00a0cell function, RASA2 was upregulated in mouse T\u00a0cells exposed to chronic infection39 or to repeated antigen stimulation12, as well as in tumour-infiltrating T\u00a0cells38 (Fig.\u00a02n and Extended Data Fig.\u00a05h,i). Published scRNA-seq datasets from human patients40,41 also revealed higher RASA2 levels in tumour-infiltrating T\u00a0cells compared with peripheral T\u00a0cells, suggesting a potential role for RASA2 in dampening T\u00a0cell responsiveness in the TME (Fig.\u00a02o). This role as a negative regulator was further supported by analysis of a published dataset of genome-wide CRISPR inhibition and CRISPR activation in T\u00a0cells for cytokine production42, which showed that repression of RASA2 tended to increase production of effector cytokines, and RASA2 activation tended to reduce production of these cytokines (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05j). Last, we found that transgenic overexpression of RASA2 in human T\u00a0cells inhibited T\u00a0cell activation and ex vivo expansion (Extended Data Fig.\u00a05k\u2013n). Together, these observations suggest that RASA2, which is downregulated during acute stimulation, can be upregulated in chronically stimulated T\u00a0cells to serve as an intrinsic signalling checkpoint to curb T\u00a0cell function.\nRASA2 KO increases cancer cell-killing capacity We next tested whether ablation of RASA2, which we found to be upregulated in tumor-infiltrating T\u00a0cells, would ameliorate chronic antigen-exposure-induced T\u00a0cell dysfunction. We established a repetitive stimulation assay where antigen-specific T\u00a0cells are co-cultured with fresh target tumour cells at 1:1 effector to target (E:T) ratios repeatedly every 48 h (Fig.\u00a03a and Methods). This repetitive stimulation assay showed a relative enrichment in antigen-specific T\u00a0cells, a decline in T\u00a0cell viability and activation levels, a change in metabolic profile, and progressive changes in key cell phenotyping markers, collectively consistent with a dysfunctional T\u00a0cell state43 (Fig.\u00a03b\u2013d and Extended Data Fig.\u00a06a,b). At a functional level, T\u00a0cells gradually lost the ability to control the expansion of cancer cells after repeated exposures (Fig.\u00a03e).\nRNA-seq analysis of RASA2 expression in repetitively stimulated T\u00a0cells showed that although RASA2 levels declined after acute stimulation, they increased upon repeated tumour exposures (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06b). These findings further suggested that RASA2 can act as a checkpoint to restrain T\u00a0cell responses in the setting of chronic stimulations. We tested this at a functional level in the repetitive stimulation assay and found that RASA2 ablation generally limited many of the dysfunctional phenotypes. For instance, RASA2 ablation limited the observed decline\nin T\u00a0cell viability seen with repeated tumour exposures (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06c). We also observed that RASA2-KO T\u00a0cells demonstrated higher levels of phospho-MAPK signalling, activation and multiple effector cytokines compared with control-edited T\u00a0cells after repeated stimulations (Fig.\u00a03f and Extended Data Fig.\u00a06d\u2013g). An enhanced effector state of RASA2-deficient T\u00a0cells was confirmed independently using an ELISA assay to measure immunomodulatory cytokines and cytolytic molecules in the supernatant of stimulated T\u00a0cells (Fig.\u00a03g). RASA2-KO T\u00a0cells were found to be in a more effector-memory-differentiated state than control cells (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06h). Canonical T\u00a0cell exhaustion genes were similar between RASA2 and control-edited T\u00a0cells after multiple stimulations, suggesting that RASA2-KO T\u00a0cells were not differentially exhausted in\u00a0vitro (Extended Data Fig.\u00a06i). RNA-seq analysis showed that RASA2-KO T\u00a0cells expressed higher levels of genes associated with the cell cycle (VRK1, AURKA and KNL1), fatty acid metabolism (SLC27A2) and mitochondria compared with control-edited T\u00a0cells after repeated stimulations (Extended Data Fig.\u00a07a). Given the importance of metabolic fitness in resisting T\u00a0cell dysfunction, we assessed metabolic profiles on a functional level in control and RASA2-KO T\u00a0cells in this repeated stimulation experiment44. A flow-cytometry-based assay confirmed higher mitochondrial mass and activity in both CAR T and TCR T\u00a0cells lacking RASA2 relative to control cells (Extended Data Fig.\u00a07b). Seahorse real-time cell metabolic analysis showed that RASA2 ablation led to increased basal and maximal oxygen consumption rates and extracellular acidification rates compared with control-edited T\u00a0cells after repeated stimulation (Fig.\u00a03h,i and Extended Data Fig.\u00a07c\u2013e). Whereas control T\u00a0cells could not use alternative energy sources after chronic stimulation, RASA2-KO T\u00a0cells maintained this ability despite the repeated antigen exposures (Extended Data Fig.\u00a07f). In summary, RASA2 ablation limits dysfunction from chronic cancer antigen exposure across an array of diverse phenotypic metrics.\nNext, we tested whether the cancer cell-killing capacity of RASA2ablated T\u00a0cells is affected by repeated exposure to tumour antigen. Although T\u00a0cells with RASA2 ablation had a moderate advantage in our cancer cell-killing assay upon first stimulation, this advantage became even more marked after multiple stimulations (Fig.\u00a03j,k). In contrast to control-edited T\u00a0cells that showed a gradual decline in the ability to control the growth of cancer cells with each stimulation, RASA2-ablated T\u00a0cells maintained their robust killing capacity after multiple stimulations (Extended Data Fig.\u00a08a). This cancer cell-killing advantage was generally consistent across multiple human blood donors and ratios of effector T\u00a0cell to cancer cells (Fig.\u00a03l). We next tested whether this resistance to T\u00a0cell dysfunction with RASA2 loss was replicated in TRAC CAR T\u00a0 cells. RASA2-edited TRAC CD19-specific CAR T\u00a0cells were co-cultured repeatedly with CD19-expressing cancer cells (Extended Data Fig.\u00a08b). As seen with the TCR T\u00a0cell model, RASA2-edited CAR T\u00a0cells continued to kill target cells efficiently following repeated cancer cell exposures, whereas the control-edited CAR T\u00a0cells were unable to control tumour cell growth (Fig.\u00a03m). This persistent killing was consistent using two different CD19+ cancer cell lines and multiple human blood donors (Extended Data Fig.\u00a08c\u2013e). This killing advantage after repetitive stimulation was specific, as demonstrated by the lack of cancer cell killing when either RASA2-KO or control TRAC CAR T\u00a0cells were co-cultured with antigen-negative cancer cells (Extended Data Fig.\u00a08f,g). Collectively, these results show that T\u00a0cells repeatedly exposed to their target antigen gradually lose the ability to control cancer cell growth, whereas ablation of RASA2 can render both TCR T and CAR T\u00a0cells resistant to this dysfunctional state.\nRASA2 KO improves T\u00a0cell anti-tumour responses To determine the translational relevance of these findings, we proceeded to test whether ablation of RASA2 would improve the performance of engineered T\u00a0cells in multiple preclinical models of adoptive T\u00a0cell therapies. First, we engrafted A375 melanoma cells, which express\nNature | Vol 609 | 1 September 2022 | 179\nNY-ESO-1, in the flanks of immunodeficient NSG mice (Fig.\u00a04a). T\u00a0cells engineered to express the 1G4 NY-ESO-1-specific TCR45 and edited to ablate RASA2 or a safe-harbour control locus (AAVS1) were transferred via tail vein injection. Transfer of RASA2-deficient T\u00a0cells significantly slowed tumour growth and improved survival compared with mice that received control-edited T\u00a0cells (Fig.\u00a04b and Extended Data Fig.\u00a09a,b). To test whether RASA2 ablation in TCR T\u00a0cells could improve control of a liquid tumour bearing the same NY-ESO-1 antigen, we injected Nalm6 leukaemia cells engineered to express NY-ESO-1 on cognate major histocompatibility complex class I molecules (MHCI) into the tail vein of mice (Fig.\u00a04c). In this leukaemia model, RASA2-deficient TCR T\u00a0cells also improved tumour control (Fig.\u00a04d and Extended Data Fig.\u00a09c,d). Thus, RASA2 ablation enhanced the efficacy of TCR-engineered adoptive T\u00a0cell therapies in both liquid and solid tumour models.\nTo test if this advantage of RASA2-KO in\u00a0vivo is applicable to the CAR T\u00a0cell context, we generated CD19-specific CAR T\u00a0cells via knock-in of the CD19-28z CAR into the TRAC locus as previously described46, with the addition of concurrent disruption of either RASA2 or of the AAVS1 locus. These CAR T\u00a0cells were transferred intravenously into NSG mice engrafted with Nalm6 leukaemia cells (Fig.\u00a04e and Extended Data Fig.\u00a09e). CAR knock-in at the TRAC locus has been shown to reduce T\u00a0cell dysfunction and increase persistence compared with CAR expressed\nby retroviral vectors46. Nonetheless, we found that the RASA2-deficient TRAC CAR T\u00a0cells had a marked advantage over control TRAC CAR T\u00a0cells in tumour control, as measured by bioluminescence imaging in cohorts of mice treated with cells from multiple different human blood donors (Fig\u00a04f,g and Extended Data Fig.\u00a09f\u2013h). This reduced tumour burden resulted in significantly prolonged survival of the mice that received RASA2-deficient TRAC CAR T\u00a0cells (Fig.\u00a04h and Extended Data Fig.\u00a09i). Whereas all mice injected with the control-edited CAR T\u00a0cells had to be euthanized by day 60, the majority receiving RASA2-KO human T\u00a0cells survived past day 60, with a subset demonstrating durable responses beyond 100 days.\nTo better understand this observed tumour-control advantage, we evaluated the bone marrow in a separate cohort of Nalm6 leukaemia-engrafted mice at two time points after CD19 CAR T\u00a0cell treatment.

To directly compare the relative T\u00a0cell expansion and persistence in the same bone marrow niche, we transferred a mix of roughly equal proportions of RASA2-KO and control T\u00a0cells to Nalm-6 bearing mice and found that RASA2-KO CAR T\u00a0cells clearly outcompeted control CAR T\u00a0cells over time in the bone marrow niche (Fig.\u00a04k and Extended Data Fig.\u00a09l,m). The persistence advantage we observed in the bone marrow as well as in the repeated cancer cell killing assays in\u00a0vitro led us to test whether RASA2 KO confers an advantage to CAR T\u00a0cells in controlling repeated leukemia injections in\u00a0vivo. These experiments required optimization such that CAR T\u00a0cell doses for a given donor were not too low when mice were already relapsing, and not too high so that all mice strongly controlled tumour rechallenge. We identified a T\u00a0cell donor that demonstrated relatively durable control of the initial tumour burden at previously identified low \u2018stress-test\u2019 CAR T\u00a0cell doses46, and then we re-introduced Nalm6 cells 3 times, 7\u201311 days apart, in a separate mouse cohort (Extended Data Fig.\u00a010a). We found that RASA2-KO CAR T\u00a0cells had an advantage over control CAR T\u00a0cells in reducing tumour burden and increasing survival in this tumour-rechallenge model, demonstrating that RASA2 ablation can improve functional persistence in\u00a0vivo (Extended Data Fig.\u00a010b,c). To assess the effects of adoptive T\u00a0cell transfer alone on the health of the mice, we injected non-tumour bearing mice with T\u00a0cells and monitored them over time. In addition, to assess tumour-antigen-stimulated T\u00a0cells, we treated an additional cohort of mice bearing Nalm6 leukaemia with control and RASA2-KO CD19 TRAC CAR T\u00a0cells to achieve tumour clearance and observed these mice to 116 days after CAR T\u00a0cell injections. In both of these cohorts, there were no observed differences in mice receiving the RASA2-KO and control TRAC CAR T\u00a0cells by visual inspection and body weight, and RASA2 KO did not alter the blood counts or histopathologic findings of recipient animals in comparison to control TRAC CAR T\u00a0cells (Extended Data Fig.\u00a010e,f).

We made use of our previously described intraperitoneal locoregional osteosarcoma (LM7) model47 and T\u00a0cells expressing EphA2.CD28z CAR48 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a010g). We injected the LM7 osteosarcoma cell line into the peritoneum of NSG mice, followed by injection of T\u00a0cells engineered to express an EphA2-specific CAR (Fig.\u00a04l). Bioluminescence measurements of tumour burden revealed that ablation of RASA2 in CAR T\u00a0cells could significantly slow tumour growth and prolong survival compared with control CAR T\u00a0cells in this model (Fig\u00a04m\u2013o and Extended Data Fig.\u00a010h\u2013j). In this cohort of mice, in the subset that cleared their tumours, RASA2-KO CAR T\u00a0cells were able to clear a tumour rechallenge at day 174 (Extended Data Fig.\u00a010k). In summary, we found that RASA2 ablation can improve the performance of TCR T and CAR T\u00a0cells against a range of preclinical models of both liquid and solid tumours, highlighting its promising translational potential for multiple immunotherapy indications."

            "text": "Inhibitory extrinsic and intrinsic cues present major challenges for current adoptive T\u00a0cell therapies14. Large-scale CRISPR genetic screens offer a powerful discovery platform to reveal genetic perturbations that render T\u00a0cells resistant to these inhibitory signals3,8\u201310. Here we used such a screening platform to model a variety of tumour-relevant suppressive conditions and found that these screens converged on RASA2 as a promising candidate target for engineering resistance to multiple inhibitory signals. Our results suggest that in the absence of RASA2, T\u00a0cells experience increased RAS signalling and activation in response to antigen exposure. This amplified response to target antigen may mitigate some of the dampening effects conferred by the suppressive factors that we tested. Notably, this heightened signalling response to antigen did not drive these cells towards dysfunction. Instead, RASA2 KO conferred a more persistent cancer killing capacity to T\u00a0cells through repeated cancer antigen exposures. These heightened proximal signalling responses to repeated antigen encounters may drive changes in downstream transcriptional programmes that help preserve T\u00a0cell function. For instance, we note that RASA2 ablation leads to higher AP-1 and NF-\u03baB transcriptional programmes with less pronounced differences in NFAT responses. This pattern is predicted to counteract T\u00a0cell anergy and/or exhaustion, which can result from unopposed NFAT signalling16. Additionally, we observed transcriptional reprogramming toward metabolic states favouring oxidative phosphorylation, which were confirmed by functional analyses of mitochondrial fitness after chronic antigen exposures, suggesting that RASA2 ablation may prevent dysfunction by altering the metabolic state of T\u00a0cells. We also find that RASA2 levels are elevated across multiple models of chronic stimulation. Although to our knowledge RASA2 had not previously been ascribed a role in T\u00a0cell biology, we show here that RASA2 serves as a key intracellular checkpoint of T\u00a0cell signalling and that its ablation leads to increased antigen sensitivity and persistent effector function in engineered human T\u00a0cells.\nOur work highlights RASA2 as a promising genetic target for engineering improved next-generation T\u00a0cells across indications. RASA2 loss boosted T\u00a0cell responses against antigen-dim target cells in\u00a0vitro, which could greatly expand the repertoire of antigen receptors available in the clinic by widening the dynamic range of T\u00a0cell signalling. Further preclinical testing is warranted to explore the efficacy and safety of RASA2 ablation in T\u00a0cell therapies. A concern might be that RASA2 loss-of-function mutations, although uncommon, have been implicated in a subset of cancers, most prominently melanoma and multiple\nmyeloma. However, it is notable that RASA2 is usually co-mutated with other tumor suppressors (such as NF-1), suggesting reduced transformation potential as a single mutation25. Use of genome-targeted CAR integration with CRISPR may help to reduce the risk of insertional mutagenesis in additional genes that could serve as tumour suppressors, which is possible with lentiviral or retroviral CAR transduction. Of note, our observation that the fitness advantage in these RASA2-KO T\u00a0cells is stimulation-dependent indicates that RASA2 loss increases antigen sensitivity without driving constitutive proliferation. This stimulation dependence may be linked to the PH domain in RASA2, which binds to the lipid second messenger phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate but not phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate49. Phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trisphosphate is present only in the active state, and recruits RASA2 to the plasma membrane, suggesting that the GAP activity of RASA2 is dependent on active PI3K signalling24. This dependence on PI3K signalling suggests that RASA2 may function as an inducible negative regulator of RAS signalling in the setting of cellular activation. Although this stimulation-dependence mitigates some concerns of using RASA2-deficient T\u00a0cells therapeutically, these cells could also be engineered with suicide switches and synthetic circuits for tighter control over the T\u00a0cell products50. Our data identifies RASA2 as a powerful regulator of T\u00a0cell responses, and ongoing work will be needed to test for enhanced reactivity for unintended antigen targets across varying TCRs and CARs. Notably, the combination of RASA2 knockout with TRAC CAR knockin, which eliminates the endogenous TCR, should reduce the risk of enhancing potentially autoreactive T\u00a0cells and improve safety45,46. Additional TCR-positive cell-depletion strategies could further reduce this risk. Overall, our findings demonstrate that RASA2 ablation increases the potency and the persistence of T\u00a0cell therapies, two key domains in which these therapies have been failing clinically. Combined with conferring resistance to suppressive cues, this makes RASA2 ablation a promising new strategy for generating more effective T\u00a0cell therapies for haematological and solid tumour indications."

            "text": "Isolation of primary T\u00a0cells from healthy donors Leukopaks from deidentified healthy donors with Institutional Review Board-approved consent forms and protocols were purchased from StemCell Technologies (200-0092). For screens, residuals from leukoreduction chambers after Trima Apheresis from deidentified\u00a0healthy donors with Institutional Review Board-approved consent forms and protocols\u00a0were purchased from\u00a0Vitalant\u00a0(formerly known as Blood Centers of the Pacific). Primary Human T\u00a0cells were isolated using EasySep Human T\u00a0cell isolation kit (17951) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol using the EasySep magnets. The cells were seeded in appropriate culture vessels and activated with Immunocult (Stem Cell Technologies, 10971) at 12.5 \u03bcl ml\u22121. Cells were kept in culture at a 106 cells per ml density throughout, and cultured with IL-2 at 50 IU ml\u22121 (unless otherwise specified). Cells were cultured in X-Vivo-15 medium which was supplemented with 5% fetal calf serum, 50 \u03bcM 2-mercaptoethanol, and 10 mM N-acetyl-l-cysteine. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were frozen down at 5 \u00d7 107 cells per vial using Bambanker (Bulldog Bio) serum-free cell freezing medium.\nPooled CRISPR-KO screens under suppressive conditions Pooled CRISPR-KO screens were performed as previously described13. In brief, isolated T\u00a0cells were stimulated as above and 24 h later they were transduced with a lentiviral pool to express the genome-wide Brunello sgRNA library51. 24 h after transduction, T\u00a0cells were washed once with PBS, electroporated with Cas9 protein and expanded in culture as above. On Day 14, T\u00a0cells were stained with CFSE and stimulated with Immunocult in the presence of either tacrolimus (TOCRIS 3631, final concentration 5 nM), cyclosporine (TOCRIS 1101, final concentration 50 nM), CGS-21680 (TOCRIS 1063, final concentration 20 \u03bcM) or TGF\u03b21 (Biolegend 781802, final concentration 10 ng ml\u22121). For the Treg cell condition, matched donor CD4+CD127lowCD25+ Treg cells were isolated on day 0 using magnetic enrichment (STEMCELL 18063), stimulated with anti-CD3/CD28 and expanded in culture until\u00a0being mixed at a\u00a01:1 ratio with the CFSE-stained effector T\u00a0cells. For all screens, 3 days after re-stimulation, stained T\u00a0cells were sorted into CFSE high and low populations\u00a0and lysed, and genomic DNA was prepped for next-generation sequencing for each sample as previously described13. We used four human donors for the stimulation and Treg cell screen, two donors for\u00a0the adenosine, cyclosporine and tacrolimus screens,\u00a0and one donor for the TGF\u03b2 screen. Screen hits were identified using MAGeCK52 v0.5.9 using paired analysis with default parameters. For tacrolimus and cyclosporine only, dividing cells were collected and compared to the undivided cells from the matched donors in the stimulation only screen. Guides with a read count of under 50 in more than 80% of the samples were filtered out. Supplementary Table\u00a01 details the guide and gene-level counts, log fold change and MAGeCK scores. To find shared hits, gene-level log2 fold-change values were scaled to obtain z-scores. Genes above a z-score of the 95% percentile (z-score >1.54) were defined as hits for the shared hits analysis to generate Fig.\u00a01b and Extended Data Fig.\u00a01c and are detailed in Supplementary Table\u00a01. To define suppressive condition-specific hits, the sgRNA counts in CFSE-low (highly dividing) cells were compared to the stimulation only (stim) condition using MAGeCK software as above. Results of this analysis are provided in Supplementary Table\u00a02. For the quality metric of screens by dropout analysis of essential genes, we used essential genes as determined by DepMap19 and GSEA for gene-level log2 fold change. For analysis of expression of screen hits in primary human T\u00a0cells the DICE database was used, averaging the expression of both activated CD4+ and CD8+ T\u00a0cells20.\nCRISPR KO in primary human T\u00a0cells using Cas9\u2013RNP electroporation T\u00a0cells were isolated and stimulated as above and 48 h later, Cas9\u2013 sgRNA\u2013RNP electroporation was performed using the Amaxa P3 Primary Cell 96-well 4D-Nucleofector Kit (Lonza, V4SP-3960). Lyophilized\ncrRNA and tracrRNAs (Dharmacon) were resuspended in nuclease-free duplex buffer (IDT 1072570) at a concentration of 160 \u03bcM. Unless otherwise stated, control-edited T\u00a0cells were targeted with the AAVS1 sequence GGGCCACTAGGGACAGGAT, and RASA2-edited T\u00a0cells were targeted with the RASA2-targeting sequence AGATATCACACATTACAGTG. In some cases, as detailed in the figure legends, the ctrl group indicates the non-targeting control guide GGTTCTTGACTACCGTAATT. The crRNAs and tRNAs were complexed at 1:1 v/v ratio for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. sgRNAs were mixed with Cas9 (Stock 40 \u03bcM) at a\u00a01:1 v/v ratio and incubated at 37 \u00b0C for 15 min to form the RNP complex. T\u00a0cells were counted, resuspended in P3 buffer at 1 \u00d7 106 per 20 \u03bcl, mixed with 3 \u03bcl of RNPs and added to a 96-well electroporation plate. The cells were electroporated using the\u00a0EH115 protocol and immediately recovered by adding 80 \u03bcl T\u00a0cell medium (X-Vivo-15, Lonza) at 37 \u00b0C for 15 min. Once recovered, cells were transferred to appropriate culture vessels in X-Vivo-15 medium with IL-2 at 50 IU ml\u22121.\nCell line authentication and testing Cell line sources were as follows: A375 (ATCC, CRL-1619), A375-CD19 (generated in this study), T2 cells (ATCC, CRL-1992), Nalm6 cells expressing luciferase, GFP and varying levels of CD19 (generated by J.E.), Nalm6 cells expressing NY-ESO-1 (generated by J.E.), Nalm6 cell line (originally purchased from ATCC, CRL-3273), LM7 osteosarcoma cells (kindly provided to G.K.\u2019s lab by Eugenie Kleinerman of the MD Anderson Cancer Center in 2011), Jurkat reporter cells (gift from Kole Roybal of the University of California, San Francisco), Jurkat cells (originally purchased from ATCC, clone E6-1), HEK293T cells (Lenti- XTM 293T cell line, Takara Bio catalogue no. 632180). Certificates of analysis were provided with cell lines from ATCC and Takara Bio. Relevant antigen expression for each cell line was routinely confirmed by flow cytometry. LM7 cells were routinely validated using the ATCC STR Profiling Cell Authentication Service. The following cell lines were tested for mycoplasma: Nalm6, A375, LM7 and 293T cells. They were mycoplasma free as tested using either the LookOut Mycoplasma PCR Detection Kit (Sigma Aldrich, catalogue no. MP0035) at UCSF or the MycoAlert Mycoplasma Detection kit (Lonza, catalogue no. LT07- 218) at St. Jude. The following cell lines were used for short-term assays and not tested for mycoplasma: T2, Jurkat reporter lines. Our results pertain to the performance of primary human T cells. The International Cell Line Authentication Committee register was consulted and no commonly misidentified lines were used."

The titration of the AAV was performed by quantitative PCR on DNaseI (NEB) treated, proteinase K (Qiagen)-digested AAV samples, using primers against the left homology arm (forward: CTTTGCTGGGCCTTTTTCCC, reverse: CCTGCCACTCAAGGAAACCT). The quantitative PCR was performed with SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad 1725201) on a StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems).\nT\u00a0cells were isolated and activated as previously described46. After 48 h of T\u00a0cell activation, cells were transfected by electroporation of RNP using a 4D Nucleofector 96 well unit (Lonza). One reaction of RNP was generated by incubating 60 pmol of Cas9 protein with 120 pmol sgRNA (Synthego, TRAC guide RNA (gRNA): ACAGGGUUCUGGAUAUCUGU) at 37 \u00b0C. Two million cells were electroporated and diluted into culture medium and incubated at 37 \u00b0C, 5% CO2. Recombinant AAV6 donor vector was added to the culture 30 to 60 min after electroporation, at the indicated multiplicity of infection (105), and incubated with the cells overnight. The day after the electroporation, edited cells were resuspended in T\u00a0cell growth medium and expanded using standard culture conditions and kept at a density of 106 cells per ml. Knock-in efficiency was evaluated by flow cytometry by staining the CAR with a goat anti-mouse Fab ( Jackson ImmunoResearch, 115-606-003)."

Cancer cell growth was calculated as the count at any given time point, normalized by the count at t = 0. For time traces showing a confidence interval as a grey shaded area, traces were smoothed by fitting a generalized additive model using the R package gam v1.20. The fitted model was also used to interpolate the trace and calculate the area under the curve for the given time interval."

            "text": "For the arrayed screen validation experiments, T\u00a0cells were isolated from two donors and edited with RNPs with gRNAs targeting genes of interest or control guides as indicated above. Genes for this arrayed validation were selected based on log fold change over the stimulation condition, false discover rate (FDR), expression level in T\u00a0cells, and relative log2 fold change across the different screens (Supplementary Table\u00a03). Two gRNAs were selected per gene, one from the screen hits, and an orthogonal guide designed by an online tool (https://www. synthego.com/products/bioinformatics/crispr-design-tool). Guide sequences are detailed in Supplementary Table\u00a03. At day 9 post isolation, T\u00a0cells were stained with CFSE to track cell divisions and stimulated with 6.25 \u03bcl ml\u22121 Immunocult at 106 cells per ml. Drug doses used for the validation of gene targets were as follows: cyclosporine, 50 nM; tacrolimus, 0.25 nM; CGS-21680, 100 \u03bcM; TGF\u03b2, 10ng ml\u22121. For the functional cancer cell killing assays, the IncuCyte system was used as above. For validation of the Treg cell resistance, Treg cells were isolated\nas above and mixed with donor-matched CFSE-stained effector T\u00a0cells at varying cell to cell ratios. For the functional cancer cell killing assays, the IncuCyte system was used as above.\nWestern blot for active RAS and for phosphoproteins For immunoblotting experiments, T\u00a0cells were serum starved for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C in RPMI (Gibco 21870076). After starvation, cells were stimulated for 0, 5, 10, 30 and 60 min with Immunocult at 12.5 \u03bcl ml\u22121 at 37 \u00b0C in a water bath. After each timepoint, the stimulation was quenched with ice-cold PBS and the cells were spun down at 300g for 5 min at 4 \u00b0C. Each pellet was resuspended in Pierce RIPA buffer (Thermo Fisher 89901) and incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 40 min. Cell lysates were stored at \u221280 \u00b0C until further use. The protein concentrations were determined using Pierce BCA Protein Assay (Thermo Fisher 23227). Fifteen micrograms of protein per sample was loaded onto 4\u201315% tris-glycine SDS gels (Bio-Rad) followed by transfer to PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad) using the Biorad Trans-Blot Transfer system. The membrane was blocked using 5% milk in TBST and incubated with primary antibodies at 4 \u00b0C overnight. Primary antibodies used: p-ERK (4370), p-MEK (9154) (Cell Signaling Technology), vinculin (MAB3574) (Millipore Sigma), RASA2 (HPA035375) (Sigma Aldrich), \u03b2-actin rabbit monoclonal (horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate) (Cell Signaling 5125), anti-rabbit HRP antibody (Cell Signaling 7074), anti-mouse IgG, HRP-linked antibody (Cell Signaling 7076), RASA2 rabbit anti-human GAP1m (NBP1-89794 Novus Biologicals), GAPDH mouse anti-human GAPDH (sc-47724 Santa Cruz Biotechnology), goat anti\u2013rabbit IgG\u2013HRP (111-036-045 Jackson ImmunoResearch) and goat anti\u2013mouse IgG\u2013HRP (sc-2005 Santa Cruz Biotechnology).\nMembranes were imaged on the Azure Biosystems 600 imaging system at UCSF, and they were imaged on the Odyssey Fc Imaging System (LI-COR Biosciences) at St Jude.\nFor the active RAS assay, T\u00a0cells and Jurkat cells (ATCC (Clone E6-1)) were serum starved for 2 h at 37 \u00b0C in RPMI (Gibco 21870076). After starvation, T\u00a0cells were stimulated for 5 min with Immunocult at 12.5 \u03bcl ml\u22121 at 37 \u00b0C in a water bath. Once incubation was complete, the stimulation was quenched with ice-cold PBS and the cells were spun down at 4 \u00b0C at 300g for 5 min. Further assay was performed according to protocol from RAS Activation Assay kit (Cytoskeleton BK008).\nFor densitometry analysis of the western blot gels, we used ImageJ v1.52q software. Using the set measurements option under the \u2018Analyze\u2019 menu, we set the measurements as mean grey value for the analysis. Next, a region of interest (ROI) was defined using the rectangle tool to draw a frame around the band of interest. The same ROI was used to quantify all of the bands. Using the same frame as the protein, measurements for the background were taken for that protein. We repeated the steps for loading controls and recorded the measurements. For the analysis, the pixel density was inverted for bands/controls and their backgrounds expressed as 255 \u2212 X, where X is the value for the protein band or loading control band. The net value for protein band and the loading control was calculated by subtracting the inverted background value from the inverted band value. The relative quantification value is calculated as a ratio of net protein band value to net loading control band value of that lane."

For these antibody stains, cells were resuspended in 2 \u03bcl antibody in 100 \u03bcl total staining buffer volume (see \u2018Bone Marrow CAR T\u00a0cell isolation, processing and staining\u2019).\nTitration assay to measure antigen dose\u2013response curve T\u00a0cells were isolated, activated, transduced with lentivirus containing the\u00a0NY-ESO-1 1G4 TCR and edited for RASA2 or AAVS1 as described above. TCR T\u00a0cells (2 \u00d7 105 to 3 \u00d7 105) were seeded per well and stimulated\nwith Immunocult. For pERK staining, the T\u00a0cells (both transduced and untransduced as a control) were stimulated for 2 min, 5 min, 10 min at 37 \u00b0C with top dose of Immunocult at 50 \u03bcl ml\u22121 and serially diluted by 2. For activation markers, T\u00a0cells were stimulated for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C with top dose of Immunocult at 12.5 \u03bcl ml\u22121 and serially diluted by 2. Subsequent staining was performed as described above.\nTo measure T\u00a0cell sensitivity to antigen-specific TCR re-stimulation, primary human T\u00a0 cells were stimulated with Immunocult, after 24 h then transduced with concentrated lentivirus to express the NY-ESO-1-specific T\u00a0cell\u00a0receptor, and 24 h later RNP-edited for RASA2 or AAVS1 as described above. Antigen-presenting T2 cells53 (ATCC CRL-1992) were loaded with the NY-ESO-1157-165 peptide SLLMWITQV (Thermofisher) by incubation at 37 \u00b0C for 1 h. Top final dose of peptide was 18 \u03bcM and was subsequently diluted by log5 serial dilutions. Unbound peptide was removed by washing twice with medium. Antigen-specific edited T\u00a0cells were added and allowed to interact with the T2 cells for 10 min before the reaction was stopped by adding a fixation buffer for pERK staining using flow cytometry as above.\nTranscriptional reporter using Jurkat cell lines Jurkat T\u00a0cell reporter systems for activator protein 1 (AP-1), nuclear factor of activated T\u00a0cells (NFAT), and nuclear factor \u03baB (NF-\u03baB) transcriptional activity were a gift from Kole Roybal\u00a0(University of California, San Francisco) and were generated as previously described54. These Jurkat reporter cells were TCR-stimulated with Immunocult at 12.5 \u03bcl ml\u22121, the top dose then serially diluted by 2 for a range of activation levels. Cells were assayed for mCherry levels every 24 h using flow cytometry.\nGeneration of transgenic RASA2 To create a transgenic RASA2 construct to use for the RASA2overexpression experiments, RASA2 ORF (NM_001303246.2, GenScript) was cloned into a retroviral pSFG vector with a Flag tag added to the N terminus using In-Fusion cloning kit (Takara). A GFP or CAR transgene was inserted into the same retroviral pSFG backbone as RASA2 for use as a transgene overexpression control. To generate T\u00a0cells expressing transgenic RASA2, cells were transduced using the same protocol used for CAR T\u00a0cell generation. In brief, retroviral particles were generated by transient transfection of HEK293T cells with the RASA2-encoding SFG retroviral vectors, Peg-Pam-e plasmid encoding MoMLV gag-pol, and a plasmid encoding the RD114 envelope protein. Supernatants were collected after 48 h, filtered and snap-frozen for later transduction of T\u00a0cells. RASA2 expression was confirmed by western blot."

OCR was measured using a 96-well extracellular flux analyser (Seahorse Bioscience). In brief, TCR T\u00a0cells or CAR T\u00a0cells were isolated from culture using a CD45 isolation kit (100-0105), plated on pre-coated 96 well plates that were coated with poly-d-lysine (103729-100) at 4 \u00d7 105 cells per well in 50 \u03bcl Seahorse XF RPMI supplemented with 10 mM glucose, 1 mM pyruvate and 2 mM glutamine per manufacturer\u2019s instructions (Seahorse XF RPMI assay medium pack 103681-100). After plating, cells were left in the incubator for an hour to ensure adherence to the wells. After inspection under the microscope confirming uniform and confluent adherence, 130 \u03bcl of the supplemented Seahorse XF RPMI medium was added to bring the volume to 180 \u03bcl per well. These plated cells were then placed for 1 h in a CO2-free incubator at 37 \u00b0C before commencing measurements using the Seahorse instrument. The Seahorse Mito stress test assay was performed using the Seahorse XF Cell Mito Stress Test Kit (103015-100), and the substrate oxidation stress tests were performed using the Agilent XF Substrate Oxidation Stress Test Kits, specifically, the XF Long Chain Fatty Acid Oxidation Stress Test Kit (103672-100), the XF Glucose/Pyruvate Oxidation Stress Test Kit (103673-100) and the XF Glutamine Oxidation Stress Test Kit (103674-100).

Experiments were performed according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. All Seahorse assays were run on a Seahorse XFe96 Analyzer.\nNY-ESO-1 TCR T\u00a0cells with A375 or Nalm6 xenograft models Eight- to ten-week-old male or female NOD-SCID-Il2rg\u2212/\u2212 (NSG) mice (Mus musculus, strain #005557) were purchased from Jax or bred in-house. All mice were housed and treated in ethical compliance with UCSF IACUC approved protocols. Mice were housed in the UCSF LARC Animal Care Facilities at the Helen Diller Family Cancer Center or at UCSF Parnassus. They were housed in an individual specific-pathogen free suite. They were housed with up to 5 mice per cage in ventilator cages, with ad libitum food and water on a 12-hour light cycle and controlled temperature and humidity conditions (19\u201323 \u00b0C and 30\u201370%). IACUC protocols used at UCSF included the UCSF Preclinical Therapeutics Core (IACUC protocol AN194778\u2014continuation of AN179937) and the Marson laboratory (AN180228-03B). To ensure equivalent pre-treatment tumour burdens, mice were randomized by tumour burden prior to T\u00a0cell injections. For the A375 melanoma xenograft study, NSG mice were engrafted with 1 \u00d7 106 A375 melanoma cells via subcutaneous injection on day 0. On day 7, 1 \u00d7 106 NY-ESO-1 TCR+ T\u00a0cells were infused via intravenous injection in the tail vein. A375 cell progression was measured by calliper measurements. For the NY-ESO-1+ Nalm6 leukemia study, NSG mice were injected intravenously with 0.3 \u00d7 106 NY-ESO-1-expressing Nalm6 leukaemia cells on day 0, followed by 0.5 \u00d7 106 control-edited or RASA2-KO NY-ESO-1-specific TCR T\u00a0cells on day 4. Bioluminescence imaging was conducted using the Xenogen IVIS Imaging System (Xenogen) with Living Image software (Xenogen) for acquisition of imaging datasets. Mice were humanely euthanized at an IACUC-approved end-point when tumour measurement reached 2 cm in the largest dimension or when they demonstrated signs of morbidity described in our IACUC protocol, such as respiratory distress, hunched posture, lesions unresponsive to treatment, body condition score of 2 or less, 15% weight loss, impaired or decreased mobility,\ntumour ulcerated or interfering with normal functions, neurologic signs that interfere with normal function, reduced grooming and piloerection, or rectal prolapse. These limits were not exceeded in any of the experiments.\u00a0For all in\u00a0vivo experiments, mice allocated to different experimental groups were sex-, age- and housing-matched.\u00a0No statistical methods were used to predetermine sample size.\u00a0Sample sizes were estimated on the basis of preliminary experiments and previously published results. We made an effort to achieve a minimum sample size of n = 5 mice per treatment arm, which proved to be sufficient to reproducibly observe statistically significant differences. Sample size is stated in each legend.\u00a0For all in\u00a0vivo experiments, mouse randomization and injections were always done by a blinded member of the Preclinical Therapeutics Core or a blinded member of the Marson laboratory. Measurements of tumour burdens, monitoring of the mice, and tumour burden analysis were performed by members of the Preclinical Therapeutics Core who were blinded to the experimental groups. For the in\u00a0vivo cell phenotyping and rechallenge experiments, when Preclinical Therapeutics Core staff were not available, J.C. collected the data and was not blinded to the groups. For the histopathological analysis of bone marrow and splenic tissues, the hematopathologist was blinded to the experimental groups.\nCD19-CAR T\u00a0cells and NALM6 xenograft model Animal experiments followed a protocol approved by the UCSF Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee. Eight- to twelve-week-old NOD/SCID/IL-2R\u03b3-null (NSG) male mice were obtained through Jax Labs or in-house breeding. Mice were intravenously injected with 0.5 \u00d7 106 FFLuc-GFP NALM-6, followed four days later by intravenous injection with 0.1\u20130.2 \u00d7 106 CD19-specific CAR T\u00a0cells. Tumour burden was monitored via bioluminescence imaging as above.\u00a0For all in\u00a0vivo CAR\u00a0T cell\u00a0experiments, mice were randomized on the basis of bioluminescence imaging results to ensure equal tumour burden distribution in each group before T\u00a0cells were transferred.\nTwo separate cohorts of NSG mice were treated in parallel to evaluate the effects of the CAR T\u00a0cells alone on the health of the mice. The first cohort was injected with 0.2 \u00d7 106 CD19-specific CAR T\u00a0cells edited for RASA2 versus a control guide as described above. The second cohort served as an antigen-experienced cohort, where NSG mice were engrafted with 0.5 \u00d7 106 FFLuc-GFP NALM-6 cells and then injected with CD19-specific CAR T\u00a0cells at tumour-clearing doses. Mice were followed over time with bioluminescence imaging and monitored by weight and for any signs of morbidity per our UCSF IACUC protocol. Bioluminescence measurements showed that the cohort receiving NALM6 cells cleared these tumours by day 18. After prolonged monitoring, mice from these cohorts were euthanized on day 116. Mouse tissues (spleen, bone marrow and lymph nodes) were fixed in phosphate buffered formalin. Prior to embedding, sternae were decalcified with a formic acid containing commercially available decalcification solution. Tissues were paraffin-embedded, sectioned and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Tissues were initially reviewed by a blinded member of the UCSF\u00a0Preclinical Therapeutics Core\u00a0for evidence of pathologic abnormalities without knowledge of the experiments from which\u00a0the individual animal tissues were generated. Tissue slides were reviewed by a blinded UCSF haematopathologist. Complete blood counts were measured from blood from these mice using a Hemavet 950 instrument.\nFor the rechallenge experiment, a donor was tested and found to exhibit durable tumour control at the same CAR T\u00a0cell doses of 0.2 \u00d7 106 CAR+ CAR T\u00a0cells per mouse. A separate cohort of mice were then engrafted with the same 0.5 \u00d7 106 number of FFLuc-GFP NALM-6 cells, and then 4 days later they were intravenously injected with 0.2 \u00d7 106 CD19 CAR+ CAR T\u00a0cells edited for RASA2 versus a control guide as before. In this case, after the CAR T\u00a0cell injection, mice were then injected with 1 \u00d7 106 FFLuc-GFP NALM-6 cells in three separate intravenous rechallenge injections 7\u201311 days apart. Mice were followed over time with\nbioluminescence imaging and monitored by weight and for any signs of morbidity per our UCSF IACUC protocol as listed above. These limits were not exceeded in any of the experiments.\nBone marrow CAR T\u00a0cell isolation, processing and staining NALM-6-bearing mice were treated with 2 \u00d7 105 TRAC CAR T\u00a0cells from a donor previously tested for in\u00a0vivo leukaemia control efficacy, and euthanized at days 7 and 16 after infusion. For bone marrow extraction, long bones of each leg were isolated by dissection, and then crushed with PBS in a mortar and pestle, followed by PBS washes through a cell strainer. Cells were then centrifuged and treated for 2 min with ACK lysing buffer (118-156-721, Quality Biological) for red blood cell lysis, the reaction was quenched with FACS buffer. Remaining cells per each mouse were then resuspended in 300 \u03bcl FACS buffer. After addition of Fc block (10 \u03bcl per sample) (130-092-575, Miltenyi Biotec), cells were stained for the CAR (1 \u03bcl per sample) (115-606-07, Jackson ImmunoResearch) and incubated for 30 min at room temperature. After a wash, cells were resuspended in 2% normal mouse serum (Millipore-Sigma) and Fc block (10 \u03bcl) and incubated for 20 min at room temperature. Next cells were stained with the relevant antibody mix (100 \u03bcl per tube staining volume; specific antibodies found above in the flow cytometry methods section) and incubated for 45 min at room temperature. After staining, cells were washed and resuspended in 300 \u03bcl FACS buffer as well as counting beads (50 \u03bcl per sample) (C36950, ThermoFisher Scientific) and then analysed by flow cytometry."

For this experiment, we made use of a version of this construct that either does or does not include a sequence for a truncated form of EGFR (EGFR-t), followed by a third self-cleaving P2A peptide. As above, these two different CAR T populations were edited for either the AAVS1 locus or the RASA2 locus. The resulting products included four CAR T\u00a0cell populations, RASA2-edited CD19 TRAC CAR T\u00a0cells with and without EGFRt, and AAVS1-edited CD19 TRAC CAR T\u00a0cells with and without EGFRt. These populations were then combined into two mixed populations, mix 1 (AAVS1-edited CD19 TRAC CAR T\u00a0cells without EGFRt + RASA2-edited CD19 TRAC CAR T\u00a0cells with EGFRt) and mix 2 (AAVS1-edited CD19 TRAC CAR T\u00a0cells with EGFRt + RASA2-edited CD19 TRAC CAR T\u00a0cells without EGFRt). Mixing percentages of each of these two mixed populations were confirmed to be approximately 50%:50% in each mixed input population on the day of infusion into Nalm6-bearing mice. Mice were euthanized at days 7 and 16 after infusion, and bone marrow was processed as above. Final percentages of AAVS1-KO versus RASA2-KO CAR T\u00a0cells isolated from the bone marrow at these time points were determined by staining for CAR and EGFR."

One 20 \u03bcl electroporation reaction was transferred to one well of a 48-well tissue culture treated plate containing RPMI 1640 supplemented with 20% FBS, 1% Glutamax, 10 ng ml\u22121 IL-7, and 5 ng ml\u22121 IL-15 (recovery medium) for overnight. The next day, CAR transduction was performed using electroporated cells.\nFor T\u00a0cell transduction, 500 \u03bcl of viral supernatants were spun down on RetroNectin (Clontech) coated 24-well non-tissue culture plate at 2,000g for 90 min. After the spin, viral supernatants were removed and electroporated T\u00a0cells were plated at 2.5 \u00d7 105 cells per well in 2 ml of recovery medium. 48 h later, CAR-transduced T\u00a0cells were transferred from the RetroNectin-coated plate to a tissue culture plate and expanded in RPMI 1640 supplemented with 10% FBS, 1% Glutamax, 10 ng ml\u22121 IL-7, and 5 ng ml\u22121 IL-15. T\u00a0cells were evaluated for CAR expression with CD19-PE (clone J3-119, Beckman Coulter) 4\u20136 days after transduction. Untransduced T\u00a0cells were used as a negative control for gating. Samples were washed with and stained in PBS (Lonza) with 1% FBS (Cytiva). LIVE/DEAD Fixable Aqua Dead Cell Stain Kit (Invitrogen, Thermo Fisher Scientific) was used as a viability dye. A FACSCanto II (BD) instrument was used to acquire flow cytometry data, which were analyzed using FlowJo v10."

Eight- to -ten-week-old female NSG mice were obtained from the SJCRH NSG colony. Mice were housed in an individual specific-pathogen free individual suite at the St Jude Animal Resource Center (ARC) which is a fully AAALAC-accredited facility. The IACUC protocol used at St Jude in the laboratory of G.K. was 623-100650. The mice were housed up to 5 mice per cage in ventilator cages, with ad libitum food and water on a 12-h light cycle and controlled temperature and relative\u00a0humidity conditions (19\u201323 \u00b0C and 30\u201370%). Mice allocated to different experimental groups were sex-, age- and housing-matched. Mice were humanely euthanized when an IACUC-approved end-point tumour measurement of bioluminescence reached >1010 photons s\u20131\u00a0or when mice demonstrated signs of distress described in our IACUC protocol such as respiratory distress, hunched posture, lesions unresponsive to treatment, 15\u201320% weight loss, impaired or decreased mobility, neurologic signs that interfere with normal function or reduced grooming. These limits were not exceeded in any of the experiments. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 \u00d7 106 LM7-GFP-ffluc osteosarcoma tumour cells. Seven days later, mice were injected intraperitoneally with 1 \u00d7 105 CAR T\u00a0cells. The experiment was performed twice with CAR T\u00a0cells generated from two different healthy donors. For the second experiment, mice that had long-term tumour-free survival (n = 1 for control KO, n = 3\nfor RASA2 KO) were re-challenged with an intraperitoneal injection of 1 \u00d7 106 LM7-GFP-ffluc tumor cells at day 174. Tumour burden was monitored by bioluminescence imaging as above."

X-axis is scaled and binned log2 fold change of CFSE low over CFSE high cells in each screen, Y-axis is the number of essential genes in each bin. As expected, essential genes tend to have a negative LFC in these CRISPR KO screens of primary human T\u00a0cells (n = 4 human donors for Stim and Tregs screens, n = 2 for Adenosine, Cyclosporine and Tacrolimus screens,\u00a0and n = 1 for the TGF\u03b2 screen. Normalized Enrichment Score (NES) and adjusted p-value by GSEA and twosided permutation test). b, Screen hits are expressed in human T\u00a0cells. X-axis is scaled and binned log2 fold change in each screen, Y-axis shows the expression in activated human T\u00a0cells20. Both negative and positive hits tended to be highly expressed in human T\u00a0cells, suggesting these pooled KO screens point to relevant T\u00a0cell biology (n = 4 human donors for Stim and Tregs screens, n = 2 for Adenosine, Cyclosporine and Tacrolimus screens,\u00a0and n = 1 for the TGF\u03b2 screen, dots are mean +/\u2212 SEM). c, Shared hits (y-axis) (z-score > 1.5, methods) across the screen conditions (x-axis) including hits unique to each individual screen. Shared hits for each subset are detailed in Supplementary Table\u00a01. d, Heatmap of the pairwise Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient for gene-level z-scores for all screen conditions. e, Volcano plots showing p-value (MAGeCK RRA one-sided test and methods) on the y-axis and gene-level z-scores on the x-axis, comparing highly dividing cells in each suppressive condition to highly dividing in the vehicle condition. Highlighted are genes found to be specific to adenosine and TGF\u03b2 screens, selected for further validation. f, Gene targets from screens were selected as either general (PAN) or more specific to certain suppressive contexts and were knocked out individually in T\u00a0cells. CFSE stained, Cas9 RNP-electroporated edited T\u00a0cells were stimulated and cultured in the different suppressive conditions. Percent of cells proliferating for each gene KO compared to control cells are displayed for each suppressive condition (n = 2 donors, 2 sgRNAs per gene target in triplicates. We highlighted gene KOs found to confer significant resistance in predicted conditions (adenosine, TGFB, and calcium/calcineurin inhibitors \u2013 Tacrolimus, and Cyclosporine), using a cut-off of FDR adjusted p-value < 0.05. For clarity, displayed are the significant p-values for gene targets according to their suppressive screen condition of origin, but results for all genes across conditions are detailed in Supplementary Table\u00a03). As expected, ADORA2A, TGFBR1 and TGFBR2, FKBP1A, and PPIA KOs conferred resistance in the adenosine, TGFB, Tacrolimus, and Cyclosporine conditions, respectively. PDE4C and NKX2-6 KOs were found to confer relatively selective resistance in the adenosine condition, and NFKB2 KO was found to increase resistance in the calcineurin inhibitor (tacrolimus and cyclosporine) conditions. TMEM222, while scoring very highly in the screens, did not increase proliferative advantage in this arrayed validation (dots are individuals replicates, black vertical lines are the mean, *p < 0.05, **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001 and ***p < 0.0001 for two-sided unpaired Student\u2019s t-test). g, Log fold change (LFC) of guides targeting RasGAP genes or the RasGEF RASGRP1, across the different suppressive screen conditions shown here. h, Expression levels (scaled to minimum of 0 and a maximum of 1) of the RasGAP family members available in the BioGPS dataset27, including RASA2, across healthy human tissues revealed RASA2 as selectively expressed in CD8+/4+ human T\u00a0cells. Data also shown for RASGRP1, a RasGEF with defined roles in TCR signaling and an expression pattern strikingly similar to that of RASA2."

As expected, tumor naive NSG mice had few cells of lymphoid appearance in their white pulp (seen here as few mononuclear cells surrounding a blood vessel) (spleens at 20X magnification). The red pulp of NSG mice contains abundant erythroid precursors (seen here as numerous cells with dense dark nuclei) as well as megakaryocytes. In comparison to the cancer naive NSG mice, the red pulp and white pulp of recipient animals were largely similar; in some mice, independent of group, some expansion of splenic white pulp was seen, consistent with engrafted lymphoid cells. Of importance, recipients of RASA2 KO TRAC CAR-T cells did not show evidence of increased lymphoid infiltrates in comparison to matched recipients of TRAC CAR-T control cells. g, Scheme of EphA2-specific CAR retroviral vectors. 4H5: scFV recognizing EphA2.
