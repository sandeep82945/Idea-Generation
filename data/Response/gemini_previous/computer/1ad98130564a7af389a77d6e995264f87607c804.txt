1. **Investigate the impact of different handcrafted feature extraction techniques on the performance of the hybrid approach.** The paper uses DSURF and HOG features, but there are many other handcrafted feature extraction techniques that could be explored. For example, one could investigate the use of texture features, shape features, or a combination of different feature types.


2. **Explore different strategies for integrating handcrafted features and CNNs.** The paper uses a simple concatenation approach to integrate handcrafted features and CNN features. However, there are other strategies that could be explored, such as feature selection, feature weighting, or multi-stream architectures.


3. **Investigate the use of deep learning techniques for handcrafted feature extraction.** Instead of using traditional handcrafted feature extraction techniques, one could use deep learning techniques to learn features directly from the data. This could potentially lead to improved performance, as deep learning techniques have been shown to be very effective for feature learning in a variety of tasks.


4. **Apply the hybrid approach to other medical image segmentation tasks.** The paper demonstrates the effectiveness of the hybrid approach for brain tumor segmentation. However, the approach could also be applied to other medical image segmentation tasks, such as lung nodule segmentation, liver segmentation, or kidney segmentation. This would help to evaluate the generalizability of the approach to different types of medical images and segmentation tasks.


5. **Develop a real-time brain tumor segmentation system.** The hybrid approach could be used to develop a real-time brain tumor segmentation system that could be used in clinical settings. This would allow doctors to quickly and accurately segment brain tumors, which could help to improve patient care.
