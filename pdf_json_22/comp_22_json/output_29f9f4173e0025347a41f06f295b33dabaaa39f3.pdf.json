For these patients, seizures may be reduced or cured by surgically removing the epileptogenic zone (EZ), which is the portion of the brain giving rise to seizures. If noninvasive data are not su ciently lateralizing or localizing, the EZ may need to be localized by precise implantation of intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG) electrodes. The choice of iEEG targets is influenced by clinicians\u2019 experience and personal knowledge of the literature, which leads to substantial variations in implantation strategies across di erent epilepsy centers. The clinical diagnostic pathway for surgical planning could be supported and standardized by an objective tool to suggest EZ locations, based on the outcomes of retrospective clinical cases reported in the literature. We present an open-source software tool that presents clinicians with an intuitive and data-driven visualization to infer the location of the symptomatogenic zone, that may overlap with the EZ. The likely EZ is represented as a probabilistic map overlaid on the patient\u2019s images, given a list of seizure semiologies observed in that specific patient. We demonstrate a case study on retrospective data from a patient treated in our unit, who underwent resective epilepsy surgery and achieved 1-year seizure freedom after surgery. The resected brain structures identified as EZ location overlapped with the regions highlighted by our tool, demonstrating its potential utility.\nKEYWORDS\nepilepsy surgery, visualization, semiology, presurgical evaluation, epileptogenic zone, electroencephalography\nFrontiers inNeuroinformatics 01 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "Anti-seizure medication (ASM) is the first-line treatment for epilepsy. However, one third of epilepsies are drug-resistant (Engel, 2016). The epileptogenic zone (EZ) is \u201cthe area of cortex indispensable for the generation of clinical seizures\u201d (Rosenow and L\u00fcders, 2001). If the EZ can be localized precisely, curative resective surgery may be performed. However, only 40\u201370% of patients remain seizure-free after surgery (Jobst and Cascino, 2015). The location of the EZ is normally inferred by a multidisciplanary team, following a multimodal noninvasive evaluation including different tools such as magnetic resonance image (MRI), neuropsychological tests, and seizure semiology reported by patients and witnesses, and recorded by video-electroencephalography (EEG). If the information regarding the location of the EZ is clear and concordant between the different evaluation tests, curative resection may be performed to treat the epilepsy. Otherwise intracranial EEG (iEEG) electrodes may be implanted to localize the EZ precisely. To determine the brain regions that need to be implanted with electrodes, i.e., the targets, the team leverages information from the previously described non-invasive examinations. The choice of targets is therefore influenced by the team\u2019s subjective experience and personal knowledge of the literature. This leads to substantial variations of implantation strategies across different epilepsy centers (Tufenkjian and L\u00fcders, 2012). Whilst the symptomatogenic and epileptogenic zones may not be coterminous, if a patient with particular semiological features becomes seizure-free after resection of a certain brain region, it is a reasonable inference considering that semiological feature as a marker for the curative resection of that area. The diagnostic pathway for surgical planning could therefore be supported and standardized by an objective tool to aid clinicians in deducing the possible EZ location from patient seizure semiology.\nIt would be useful for clinicians to be able to quickly and easily assess relevant studies in the literature for a specific semiology. Such a method has been proposed using a large number of studies analyzed via the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyzes (PRISMA) framework (Page et al., 2021) to generate Semio2Brain, a database of entries mapping seizure semiologies to brain regions (Alim-Marvasti et al., 2022b). Clinicians and researchers would also benefit from a easy-to-use and intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) to such a database. Moreover, visualizing the probability of each structure containing the EZ on 3D multimodality imaging (3DMMI) could help plan resection or iEEG implantation strategies (Nowell et al., 2015, 2017), and potentially be used to guide automatic iEEG trajectory planning (ATP) (Sparks et al., 2017). Finally, a 3DMMI visualization could be used to perform qualitative and quantitative analyzes of information contained in the database and further refine its utility to predict the EZ.\nIn this work, we present the Semiology Visualization Tool (SVT), a software tool that, given an observed list of seizure\nIn this example, according to the hypothetical literature analyzed to build the database, structure C was one of the resected structures in 20 patients (datapoints) presentingHead version who became seizure-free after surgery, suggesting a high probability of the EZ being associated with that structure. Structure Bwas resected for five patients who became seizure-free after surgery. Structure A was never resected in patients who presentedHead version and became seizure-free after surgery. This result would support the decision of implanting electrodes in structure C (and possibly B), as they are likely to be associated with the EZ according to the retrospective information in the literature.\nsemiologies, provided by clinical observation, and other patient data, such as the dominant hemisphere, displays probable EZ locations in an intuitive way. The SVT provides a table with the number of datapoints associated with each brain region, where each datapoint represents a patient reported in the literature presenting the observed semiology, with an EZ objectively determined to arise from the brain region, e.g., becoming seizure-free after resection of that region (Table 1). Then, the information in the table is additionally represented using an intuitive 3DMMI visualization, personalized to each patient\u2019s imaging data, where locations that are likely to be in the EZ are highlighted with brighter colors (Figure 5)."

The default behavior when the user opts not to load imaging data, or the SVT is being used to explore the database and not for surgical planning, is to load a generic Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) template (Fonov et al., 2009). As the EZ is expected to be in the gray matter, the brain parcellation is automatically stripped of white matter and other irrelevant structures such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), brainstem and cerebellum, for visualization and reporting purposes. The input brain parcellation must be chosen based on the parcellation scheme in the database being queried. In this work, we use the Semio2Brain database, which uses the Neuromorphometics atlas integrated in the geodesical information flows (GIF) parcellation tool (Cardoso et al., 2015). However, the SVT is agnostic to the atlas choice.\nFinally, 3D meshes are generated for visualization using the marching cubes algorithm (Lorensen and Cline, 1987; Pinter et al., 2019).

Each datapoint represents a patient case from the literature presenting the observed semiology, where the EZ was objectively demonstrated to be related to the brain region after observing seizure freedom post-resection. If multiple semiologies are selected, results are combined and a number between 0 and 1 is computed for each brain structure by the database query package (in this work, mega_analysis).

The 2D slice views are centered on the brain structure with the highest number of associated datapoints. Brain structures without datapoints are hidden from the 2D slice views and shown in gray on the 3D view. To emphasize the importance of brain structures with a high number of datapoints, the opacity of each structure on the 2D slice views is adjusted to be linearly proportional to the number of associated datapoints. We chose the opensource, perceptually uniform, sequential colormap viridis as default for this application. This implies that the brightness of each structure is also linearly proportional to the number of associated datapoints. Other colormaps are available as a user-selectable option, if desired. The colorbars on the 2D slice views help create a mental mapping from colors to number of datapoints (Figures 5\u20137).\nAdvanced visualization settings may be selected by the users. Settings include showing only one hemisphere on the 3D view, setting the minimum opacity on the 2D views or enabling color blind mode, in which the color-blind-friendly cividis colormap is used (Nu\u00f1ez et al., 2018) (Figure 6)."

In this work, we present an open-source software tool to visualize regions of the brain with a high probability of being associated with the EZ, given a set of observed seizure semiologies. To the best of our knowledge, our tool is the first one to provide evidence-based, quantitative and qualitative insights on the probable EZ locations using 3DMMI.\nThe SVT is not designed to replace clinicians in planning the iEEG implantation or the resective surgery, but to support their decisions using a data-driven approach that displays patterns in the literature intuitively and objectively. Our expectation is that the results of this analysis may increase the number of cerebral areas targeted with iEEG, but would not reduce them. This could be caused by the SVT highlighting regions not previously considered due to the experience of the team but which the literature suggests may be implicated.\nIn the future, we will improve the generalizability of our framework to improve the compatibility with custom databases and other brain parcellation strategies, such as the DesikanKilliany atlas (Desikan et al., 2006). Additional development of a full online version of our SVT hosted on a well-established cloud infrastructure service, such as Microsoft Azure or Google Cloud would allow for a fast and seamless user experience. Another potential improvement is adding support to parcellate the brain at loading time using a deep learning model (Li et al., 2017; P\u00e9rez-Garc\u00eda, 2019), that satisfies the requirements of the selected database and corresponding API. This would spare the user the need to wait for hours before the parcellation is generated, which is typically the case for GIF (Cardoso et al., 2015) or FreeSurfer6."
