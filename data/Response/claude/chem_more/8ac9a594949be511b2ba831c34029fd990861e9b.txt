 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Perform in vitro testing to validate the binding and inhibitory activity of the identified lead compounds against Nsp4. This would provide experimental confirmation of the computational predictions.

2. Use the lead compounds as a starting point to synthesize and test analogues to improve potency, selectivity, and drug-like properties. Structure-activity relationship studies could optimize the compounds.  

3. Test the lead compounds against live PRRSV in cell culture to assess antiviral efficacy and cytotoxicity. This would determine if they can effectively inhibit viral replication.

4. Evaluate the lead compounds in animal models of PRRSV infection to examine their ability to reduce virus levels and improve disease outcomes. This would demonstrate preclinical efficacy. 

5. Determine the specific mechanisms of Nsp4 inhibition. Do the compounds block protease activity, interfere with protein-protein interactions, or act through some other mechanism? Elucidating the mode of action could further aid optimization efforts.
