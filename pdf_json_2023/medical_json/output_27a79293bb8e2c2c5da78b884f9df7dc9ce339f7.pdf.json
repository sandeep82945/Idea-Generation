In poultry, only one UCP homologue has been identified and experimentally shown to be associated with growth, feed conversion ratio, and abdominal fat according to its predominant expression in bird muscles. In endotherm birds, cell metabolic e ciency can be tuned by the rate of mitochondrial coupling. Thus, avUCP may be a key contributor to controlling metabolic rate during particular environmental changes.\nMethods: This study aimed to perform a set of in-silico investigations primarily focused on the structural, biological, and biomimetic functions of avUCP. Thereby, using in silico genome analyses among 8 avian species (chicken, turkey, swallow, manakin, sparrow, wagtail, pigeon, and mallard) and a series of bioinformatic approaches, we provide phylogenetic inference and comparative genomics of avUCPs and investigate whether sequence variation can alter coding sequence characteristics, the protein structure, and its biological features. Complementarily, a combination of literaturemining and prediction approaches was also applied to predict the gene networks of avUCP to identify genes, pathways, and biological crosstalk associated with avUCP function.\nResults: The results showed the evolutionary alteration of UCP proteins in di erent avian species. Uncoupling proteins in avian species are highly conserved trans membrane proteins as seen by sequence alignment, physiochemical parameters, and predicted protein structures. Taken together, avUCP has the potential to be considered a functional marker for the identification of cell metabolic state, thermogenesis, and oxidative stress caused by cold, heat, fasting, transfer, and other chemical stimuli stresses in birds. It can also be deduced that avUCP, in migrant or domestic birds, may increase heat stress resistance by reducing fatty acid transport/boxidation and thermoregulation alongside antioxidant defense mechanisms. The predicted gene network for avUCP highlighted a cluster of 21 genes involved in response to stress and 28 genes related to lipid metabolism and the proton bu ering system. Finally, among 11 enriched pathways, crosstalk of 5 signaling pathways including MAPK, adipocytokine, mTOR, insulin, ErbB, and GnRH was predicted, indicating a possible combination of positive or negative feedback among pathways to regulate avUCP functions.\nFrontiers in Veterinary Science 01 frontiersin.org\nDiscussion: Genetic selection for fast-growing commercial poultry has unintentionally increased susceptibility tomany kinds of oxidative stress, and so avUCP could be considered as a potential candidate gene for balancing energy expenditure and reactive oxygen species production, especially in breeding programs. In conclusion, avUCP can be introduced as a pleiotropic gene that requires the contribution of regulatory genes, hormones, pathways, and genetic crosstalk to allow its finely-tuned function.\nKEYWORDS\navian uncoupling protein, nucleotide coding sequence, protein structure prediction, codon usage, pathway crosstalk"

            "text": "Generalized homeostasis of energy expenditure and energy intake is essential for the best selection criteria in poultry, however, the regulatory mechanisms connecting feed intake, growth, and energy balance are still confusing. A growing body of literature implies avian Uncoupling Protein (avUCP) plays a key role in cell metabolism and adaptive thermogenesis. It thus may have the potential to be considered the missing link in the chain of whole-body energy homeostasis in chickens. The avUCP is a homolog with more than 70% protein sequence similarity with mammalian UCP3 and UCP2, harboring two conserved regions of the mitochondrial carrier and ADP/ATP transporter translocase (1, 2). The avUCP gene was first identified in 2001 after screening a hummingbird skeletal muscle cDNA library (3). Subsequent studies in different avian species revealed a predominant expression of avUCP mRNA in skeletal muscle in chicken (Gallus gallus), king penguin (Aptenodytes patagonicus), and hummingbird (Eupetomena macroura) (1, 4\u2013 7). The interconnection of growth, oxidative stress, reproductive\nAbbreviations: ADP, Adenosine diphosphate; AI, Aliphatic index; AMPK,\nAMP-activated protein kinase; ATP, Adenosine triphosphate; CAI, Codon\nAdaptation Index; cDNA, Complementary DNA; CDS, Coding sequence;\nCS, Citrate synthase; CU, Codon usage; FDR, False discovery rate;\nGDP, Guanosine diphosphate; GO, Gene ontology; HK1, Hexokinase\n1; HK2, Hexokinase 2; II, Instability index; IL-6, Interleukin 6; LDHA,\nLactate dehydrogenase A; LDHB, Lactate dehydrogenase B; mRNA,\nMessenger RNA; PDHX, Pyruvate dehydrogenase complex component\nX; PFK, Phosphofructokinase; PGC-1\u03b1, Peroxisome proliferator-activated\nreceptor \u03b3 coactivator-1\u03b1; Pi, Inorganic phosphate; PK, Protein kinase; PPARGC1A, PPARG coactivator 1 alpha; PPARs, Peroxisome proliferator-\nactivated receptors; ROS, Reactive oxygen species; RSCU, Relative\nSynonymous Codon Usage; SDHA, Succinate dehydrogenase complex\nflavoprotein subunit A; SDHB, Succinate dehydrogenase complex iron\nsulfur subunit B; SLC25A4, Solute Carrier Family 25 Member 4;\nTNF\u03b1, Tumor necrosis factor alpha; TORC1, TOR complex 1; UCP,\nUncoupling Protein.\nstate, immunity, and feather coloration processes and their efficacy on thermo-regulation have been suggested by several studies (8\u201312).\nFor a long time, shivering thermogenesis has been known to be the main thermogenic mechanism in avian species (13, 14), although the evidence for the existence of adaptive mechanisms of heat production and non-shivering thermogenesis are currently growing (1). This thermogenesis mechanism can be boosted by increasing oxidative metabolic capacity along with the uncoupling of aerobic metabolism from ATP production. Also, previous studies support the involvement of avUCP in avian energy expenditure and adaptive thermogenesis (1, 15\u2013 18). Taouis et al. showed that early thermal conditioning in broiler chicks can instantly reduce body temperature and avUCP expression in the pectoral muscle, which may potentially improve the resistance to heat stress in broilers (15). In contrast, another study showed that diet-induced thermogenesis had no control over feed intake in layers and broilers and the expression of avUCP was not influenced by layer and broiler genotypes. Consequently, these findings led to the rejection of the hypothesis of the involvement of avUCP in diet-induced thermogenesis (19). A study in ducklings has verified that, in proportion to the degree of cold, the increase in metabolic heat production occurs in parallel with the upregulation of avUCP and higher mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, while no change in mitochondrial membrane conductance capacity occurred (20).\navUCP has also been suggested to be involved in cell metabolism. Several studies have identified polymorphism of the avUCP gene that is associated with fat metabolism, growth, feed intake, and exposure to abiotic stress conditions (2, 21, 22). Additionally, it was also revealed that the upregulation of avUCP can result in the down-regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in the skeletal muscle of fasted chickens (23). On the other hand, the avUCP expressed in glycolytic muscle fibers may be a passive transporter of pyruvate for ensuring a sustained balance between glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation (24). Conversely, it was demonstrated that heat\nFrontiers in Veterinary Science 02 frontiersin.org\nstress stimulates mitochondrial superoxide production in broiler skeletal muscle through the downregulation of uncoupling protein (25, 26). Another study showed that the expression of members of the beta-oxidation pathway and mitochondrial fatty acid transport were upregulated upon heat stress. However, the expression of avUCP did not control ROS production in heat-stressed chickens (18). Heat stress, by causing oxidative stress, impairs mitochondrial function by decreasing avUCP expression (27) which can further impair meat quality and increases glycolysis and intramuscular fat deposition (2, 28, 29). Additionally, the upregulation of avUCP and avPGC1\u03b1 together can help to reduce ROS accumulation and lipid oxidation in the skeletal muscles of birds (28, 30). Several distinct studies of avUCP, have demonstrated the regulation of avUCP expression and regulation of its putative function. Accordingly, thyroid hormones were reported to increase thermogenic capacity in the avian muscle and liver (31, 32). Moreover, uncoupling of sarco- endoplasmic reticulum calcium ATPase pump activity in muscle (33) and regulation of glycolysis are involved in controlling thermogenic processes in avian species. Some studies have implied that thermogenesis is controlled by thyroid hormone affecting PPARGC1A and SLC25A4 gene expression in chickens (34, 35). However, triiodothyronine (T3) is reported to have a biphasic effect on avUCP expression (32). Another study investigating variations in avUCP expression, thyroid hormone metabolism, and heat production during cold exposure has reported a significant increase in body temperature, avUCP expression, T3 level, renal outer-ring deiodination activity, and also increased thyroxine (T4) level, and hepatic inner-ring deiodination activity. Meanwhile, no significant differences in body weight and feed intake were reported in comparison with chickens reared in normal temperatures (36).\nMoreover, it has been implied that avUCP gene expression is down-regulated by leptin hormone and up-regulated by proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF\u03b1 through modulation of avUCP-related transcription factors (PPARs and PGC1\u03b1) (32). Two-fold over-expression in gastrocnemius muscle, significant down-regulation, and no significant change were reported in avUCP mRNA expression through injection of thyroid hormone, methimazole, and insulin respectively (16). Additionally, selenium deficiency in broilers can cause a reduction in avUCPmRNA levels that results in oxidative stress, inflammation, and glyco-metabolism disorders (37).\nFurthermore, in fat chickens with a higher fat diet, avUCP was significantly up-regulated, which could be correlated with the particular need for antioxidant pathways in muscle (38). Previous research has provided some evidence for the involvement of the beta-adrenergic system, PPAR transcription factors, and the AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) to control the expression of avUCP (39). Furthermore, oral use of D-aspartate resulted in a reduction in body temperature through the decline in avUCP mRNA expression in the breast muscle,\nwhich may be involved in reduced mitochondrial proton leaks and heat production (40).\nThere is also some evidence Oleuropein can also affect avUCP expression as well as genes related to mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation and induce mitochondrial biogenesis in avian muscle cells. Oleuropeins can suppress mitochondrial superoxide production, through up-regulation of avUCP and manganese superoxide dismutase (41, 42). Therefore, the orexin system in avian muscle cells can regulate mitochondrial dynamics without affecting ATP synthesis (43). Evidence has also been presented that retinoic acid can activate the thermogenic function of avUCP in birds (44). Interestingly, \u201cavian\u201d is reported to be the only vertebrate lineage having just one UCP gene (45). Thus, the avian uncoupling protein seems to provide a unique opportunity to explore the functional activity and regulation patterns of UCP. We aimed, therefore, to investigate avUCPs in eight different avian species (chicken, turkey, swallow, manakin, sparrow, wagtail, pigeon, and mallard) through a wide range of comparative bioinformatics analyses to better understand the details of avUCPs, from their coding sequences to their functional consequences."

The Codon Adaptation Index (CAI) for each of the studied avian species was estimated using the Markov model with 500 replications over the avUCP DNA sequence. As the reference set to calculate the CAI is important for interpretation, the codon usage table for each species (if it exists), from the codon usage database on the CAIcal server (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/codon/) was therefore utilized (47).

After excluding the three stop codons, 25 codons in pigeon, sparrow, turkey, wagtail, 24 codons in chicken, mallard, and swallow, and 23 codons in manakin avUCP were observed with an RSCU value higher than 1. Moreover, the numbers of unused codons (RSCU = 0) were as follows: chicken\u221213, mallard\u221214, manakin\u22128, pigeon\u221216, swallow\u221213, sparrow\u221215, turkey\u221211, and wagtail\u221218.

Because the secondary and tertiary structures of the protein are completely influenced by its primary structure, any differences in amino acid sequences can potentially modify the secondary and tertiary structures. Within the eight avUCP proteins, slightly different percentages of \u03b1-helical and \u03b2-turn formations were derived.

Moreover, both hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions can be seen throughout the avUCP sequence. Accordingly, six areas with positive hydropathy are likely to represent transmembrane helices, which indicates avUCP can function as a trans membrane protein (Figure 6A). Meanwhile, areas with negative hydropathy show that these regions can form the extracellular part of avUCP (Figure 6A).\nUltimately, among the eight avUCPs, the predicted structure with the highest sequence identity (71%), alignment coverage (94%), interface similarity (51%), and confidence (100%) is illustrated in Figures 6A\u2013C. The nuclear magnetic resonance molecular fragment replacement approach was applied to respecify protein structure using the Swiss-Model web tool.

Although manakin had the\nFrontiers in Veterinary Science 13 frontiersin.org\nlowest GC ratio among the studied birds, it revealed the highest CAI, indicating that it uses 71.2% of the frequently used codons. Manakin usesmost of the synonymous codons (53/61 codons) to encode avUCP so that it has the lowest number of unused codons (8). Interestingly, manakin is the only species among the selected birds which breeds in tropical forests. Therefore, the observed differences in manakin may be a result of adaptation to tropical conditions. Furthermore, the use of a comparatively wide range of synonymous codons alongside the use of frequently-used codons can be regarded as an evolutionary variation to achieve efficient translation in relatively important functional genes."

            "text": "In protein sequence and physio-chemical analysis, a slight variation in amino acids and physio-chemical parameters among the eight studied avUCP proteins was detected. Tyrosine was the only amino acid showing a constant level in all avian species. The range of isoelectric points of UCPs implies that UCPs can be membrane proteins. As the pH of the intermembrane space and the mitochondrial matrix is about 7.0 and 8.0, respectively, thus UCPs carry an electrical charge in that region. Additionally, since aliphatic side chains like alanine, leucine, and valine determine the aliphatic index (AI) of a protein, avUCP, which shows a high content of these amino acids, could be considered thermostable. The highest AI of 100.42 was observed inmanakin avUCP whichmay illustrate the importance of avUCP stability specifically in manakin.\nThe variation of atomic sulfur count from 14 to 20 among the eight avUCP proteins illustrates another significant difference among avian species. Sulfur can be found in cysteine and methionine amino acids. Nine cysteine residues were observed in avUCP in sparrow but the protein sequence of the others contained eight cysteine residues. Furthermore, the hydrophobic methionine was variable among avUCPs, which could be the second source of variability in atomic sulfur count among avUCP sequences in the studied species. Sulfurcontaining amino acids are responsible for stronger connections than aliphatic and aromatic amino acids. Thus, they can provide a more sustainable 3D structure representing functional specificity in membrane proteins by creating a disulfide bond (77, 82). The percentage of hydrophobic and hydrophilic amino acids in the studied sequences were very close to each other indicating that these chemical characteristics play important roles in the encoded avUCP protein. The higher potential of hydrophobicity according to GRAVY indices above 0 is another appropriate state for transmembrane proteins. If a protein plays an important functional role, the state of its hydrophobicity and hydrophilicity will remain stable as much as possible, for the conservation of its function. Also, the stability of positively and negatively charged amino acids among all studied avUCPs may imply the effectiveness of charged regions of this protein which needs to be conserved among birds."

Moreover, the absence of any region with more than 10 consecutive amino acids with an average entropy of >1 can be concluded as evidence of conservation in avUCPs."

In agreement with our result, it is already known that transmembrane regions of proteins contain a high level of alpha-helices devoid of polar amino acids, while extracellular and cytoplasmic regions of the protein are usually enriched with polar amino acids like tyrosine and tryptophan (77).\nThe Ramachandran parameters of predicted protein can display the statistical distribution of the combinations of torsional Phi and Psi angles in the avUCP protein structure (85). Moreover, rotamers in protein structure imply conformational isomers of amino acid residues in the sidechain of avUCP, therefore, rotamer outliers display conformations that drop outside the reference (86). Also, C-beta deviation can reflect misfit conformation and inconsistency between sidechain and protein backbone that can be used for structure validation (87). In the current structural modeling for avUCP, the two C-beta deviations have resulted from valine and proline amino acids in positions 56 and 50, respectively, which were predicted to be in the cytoplasmic region of avUCP.\nHence, in addition to regulatory hormones and elements, different innate parameters can affect gene expression patterns of any pleiotropic genes like avUCP, with those parameters including, codon usage, GC content, CpG dinucleotide content, splicing sites, CpG islands, mRNA secondary structure, coding sequences (CDS), ribosomal binding sites, stimulators, the expression of other genes, along with environmental conditions (78, 88). For example, previous research has revealed cysteine residues of UCPs can be glutathionylated (89\u201392). They suggest that reactive oxygen species and glutathionylation can regulate non-phosphorylating respiration. Mailloux et al. (93) have identified Cys25 and Cys259 as the probable glutathionylation sites on UCPs (93). Interestingly, in the current study Cys25 and Cys257 were determined as conserved sites and predicted to be located in transmembrane and cytoplasmic regions of avUCP, respectively.\nFrontiers in Veterinary Science 14 frontiersin.org"

In this regard, some studies support the involvement of avUCP in avian energy expenditure and adaptive thermogenesis (1, 15\u201318). Additionally, it should be mentioned that cold acclimation can not only induce fatty acid-mediated uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation processes but also increases the rate of ADP and Pi concentrations, along with ATP synthesis in the mitochondria of chicken skeletal muscle, which seems to be a counterproductive occurrence in response to cold stress condition in birds (34). Moreover, Ueda et al. reported a correlation between uncoupling and both exogenous and endogenous fatty acids in the mitochondria of chicken skeletal muscle during cold temperatures (94). Another study conducted on king penguins showed that superoxide activates the proton transport of mitochondria and GDP inhibits the transport of the superoxide-activated-proton, demonstrating that avUCP mediates mitochondrial proton transport but plays no role in the basal proton leak (6). Because thermogenic hormones have an induction effect on avUCP expression, the involvement of avUCP in avian thermogenesis can be concluded (16)."

Our wellcategorized findings are in agreement with the outputs of other studies.

In general, biological pathway crosstalk refers to the different feedback in seemingly distinct pathways (99). Consequently, it seems that maintaining a delicate balance of avUCP functions such as lipid metabolism, thermogenesis, response to cold, and response to ROS can occur by crosstalk between involved pathways. Moreover, when a single gene is considered in depth, within a network of genes, all potential regulatory interferences will emerge. Additionally, it is also known that the interaction between pathways can regulate specific gene expression (100, 101).\nA panoply of changes in the primary sequence of avUCPs can potentially be involved in changes to protein function and expression through alteration of the final structure of the avUCP molecule. Accumulation of findings represents avUCP as an essential gene for whole-body energy balance, adaptive thermogenesis, and antioxidant defense in birds. This study contributes to a better understanding of avUCP characterization, function, and critical signaling pathways for evaluating how it is regulated in avian species exposed to different conditions. Additionally, the present study provides putative functions for avUCPs, and indicates some of the genes, pathways, and mechanisms that are involved in fine-tuning mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation.\nIn conclusion, we have compared the sequence, structure and physio-chemical properties of avUCP in 8 bird species and determine the functional pathways and networks in which avUCP is involved. Oxidative stress in birds is known as one of the most energy-demanding events influencing energy expenditure, the balance of detoxification of free radicals, and oxidative phosphorylation, so avUCP could be viewed as a significant marker for developing heat-stress-resistant breeds in future genomic selection programmes.\nData availability statement\nThe data presented in the study (nucleotide coding sequences and amino acid sequences of avian uncoupling proteins in FASTA format) are deposited at https://figshare. com/ with the accession number https://figshare.com/search? q=10.6084%2Fm9.figshare.20518086 and are also presented in Table 1.\nAuthor contributions\nPD and MG-Z conceived the overall design, undertook the project management, contributed to the interpretation of results, and critically revised the manuscript.
