1. **Investigate the nature of the non-analytic region in the entropy.** What is the physical origin of this region, and how does it affect the thermodynamic properties of the system?
2. **Develop new methods for calculating the free energy of the tethered hard sphere system.** The existing methods are limited in their applicability, and new methods are needed that can be used to calculate the free energy for a wider range of conditions.
3. **Study the phase behavior of the tethered hard sphere system.** The phase diagram of the untethered hard sphere system is well-known, but the phase behavior of the tethered system is less well understood. New experiments and simulations are needed to determine the phase diagram of the tethered system and to understand the effects of the tether on the phase behavior.
4. **Explore the applications of the tethered hard sphere model.** The tethered hard sphere model is a versatile model that can be used to study a wide range of physical phenomena. New applications of the model need to be explored, such as its use to study the behavior of fluids in confined spaces or the behavior of materials under stress.
5. **Develop new theoretical approaches to understanding the tethered hard sphere system.** The existing theoretical approaches to understanding the tethered hard sphere system are limited in their scope. New theoretical approaches are needed that can provide a more complete understanding of the system's behavior.
