    "abstractText": "The D2 subunit dopamine receptor represents a key factor in modulating dopamine release. Moreover, the investigated radiopharmaceutical ligands used in positron emission tomography imaging techniques are known to bind D2 receptors, allowing for dopaminergic pathways quantification in the living human brain. Thus, the biophysical characterization of these radioligands is expected to provide additional insights into the interaction mechanisms between the vehicle molecules and their targets. Using molecular dynamics simulations and QM calculations, the present study aimed to investigate the potential positions in which the D2 dopamine receptor would most likely interact with the three distinctive synthetic 11C-labeled compounds (raclopride (3,5dichloro-N-[[(2S)-1-ethylpyrrolidin-2-yl]methyl]-2-hydroxy-6-methoxybenzamide)\u2014RACL, FLB457 (5-bromo-N-[[(2S)-1-ethylpyrrolidin-2-yl]methyl]-2,3-dimethoxybenzamide)\u2014FLB457 and SCH23390 (R(+)-7-Chloro-8-hydroxy-3-methyl-1-phenyl-2,3,4,5-tetrahydro-1H-3-benzazepine)\u2014SCH)), as well as to estimate the binding affinities of the ligand-receptor complexes. A docking study was performed prior to multiple 50 ns molecular dynamics productions for the ligands situated at the top and bottom interacting pockets of the receptor. The most prominent motions for the RACL ligand were described by the high fluctuations of the peripheral aliphatic -CH3 groups and by its C-Cl aromatic ring groups. In good agreement with the experimental data, the D2 dopamine receptor-RACL complex showed the highest interacting patterns for ligands docked at the receptor\u2019s top position.",

However, if dysregulations in the dopaminergic system occur, these may lead to severe disorders such as schizophrenia, Parkinson\u2019s disease, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, Tourette\u2019s syndrome, depression, or nausea and vomiting [1]. Gene-cloning procedures of DA receptors allow for a better characterization of DA receptor subtypes (D1\u2013D5), as well as their disposability throughout the central nervous system (CNS) and their role in specific disorders. Furthermore, experimental approaches led to a better understanding of the D1 and D2 receptors from a functional point of view. These studies allowed for a better characterization concerning D1DR and D2DR subunit behavior, as well as their interactions with other neurotransmitters [3,4].\nInt. J. Mol.

Sci. 2022, 23, 2005 2 of 16\nThe D2 dopamine receptor (encoded D2DR) is the main target for antipsychotic drugs or for drugs used in Parkinson\u2019s disease treatment. D2DR acts as an autoreceptor and represents an essential factor in modulating DA release [2]. However, most drugs targeting D2DR can cause serious brain-level damage and have life-threatening side effects on movement control, emotional behavior, and mental health. D2DR antagonists were initially developed to prevent hallucinations and delusions affecting people suffering from schizophrenia. Additionally, new D2DR antagonists can be used as tracers in positron emission tomography (PET). A proper example would be raclopride (Figure 1), a synthetic compound used for in vitro (autoradiography) techniques as well as in vivo (PET scans) imaging when labeled with radioisotopes (e.g., with 11C) [5]. The diagnosis of movement disorders and keeping Huntington\u2019s disease under surveillance are main examples of raclopride usage. RACL is also helpful in measuring the potency and neurotoxicity of dopaminergic drugs [6].\nInt. J. Mol.

An experimental study [7] revealed that this molecule has a high binding affinity to D2 and D3 dopamine subunits in vitro, and it was also demonstrated that this compound does not only bind at the striatum level but in several extrastriatal brain regions too [7\u20139]. Halobenzazepine, also known as SCH23290 (Figure 1), is a synthetic compound with high affinity for the D1DR subunit. Despite this greater specificity for D1DR, several studies [10] have demonstrated that SCH also antagonizes processes (such as locomotion in control rats) induced by other compounds with a direct effect on the D2 dopamine receptor sites. Further research must be considered to determine whether dopaminergic compounds are essential for the SCH ligand\u2019s effect on D2DR [10]. Studies using molecular dynamics (MD) [11] simulations covered many aspects of D2DR interactions with different types of drugs. In 2005, Hjerde et al. [12] approached D2\u2019s interactions with typical (haloperidol and loxapine) and atypical (clozapine and melperone) antipsychotic drugs. The study concluded that D2DR has higher nonbonded interactions with typical drugs, with a lower displacement induced in TMH5. Other studies have used MD simulations and quantum mechanics (QM) to describe D2DR\u2019s interaction with distinctive ligands. For example, Andujar et al. [13] focused on whether tetrahydroisoquinolines act as dopaminergic ligands, while computational modeling techniques were used to determine the mechanistic role of helix 8 in GPCRs (G proteincoupled receptors) found at the surface of cells that detect molecules outside the cell and activate cellular responses [14]) and dopamine D2 receptor\u2019s interaction with the GIPC1\u2013 PDZ domain [15]. GPC receptors present positively charged residues on the cytoplasmic matrix of membranes (Figure 2) and are mainly found under \u03b1-helical conformations. D2DR\u2019s most favorable interactions in transmembrane models were observed around arginine and lysine residues. At the membrane surface, these residues are known to form\nFigure 1.

[13] focused on whether tetrahydroisoquinolines act as dopaminergic ligands, while computational modeling techniques were used to determine the mechanistic role of helix 8 in GPCRs (G protein-coupled receptors) found at the surface of cells that detect molecules outside the cell and activate cellular responses [14]) and dopamine D2 receptor\u2019s interaction with the GIPC1\u2013PDZ domain [15]. GPC receptors present positively charged residues on the cytoplasmic matrix of membranes (Figure 2) and are mainly found under \u03b1-helical conformations. D2DR\u2019s most favorable interactions in transmembrane models were observed around arginine and lysine residues. At the membrane surface, these residues are known to form abundant positively charged rings that are complementary to electronegatively charged surfaces [14].\nInt. J. Mol.

The motivation behind this study relies on the highly debated aspects within the literature related to the three widely used radioligands: their specific radioactivity (here we were interested in their binding sites), their uptake mechanisms (structural and dynamical properties), and\u2014maybe the most debated and important matter in clinical trials\u2014their selectivity. For the latter aspect, the chemical and biochemical interactions between the ligand\u2019s molecular structure and different parts/subparts of the living organism can be accurately addressed only through experimental approaches. However, the biophysical characterization of these radioligands provides additional insights into the interaction mechanisms between the vehicle molecules and their targets. Both sets of the resulting docked structures, one using a blind docking technique (for the top section of D2DR) and another using a specific docking approach with a particular grid search method (for the bottom part of the receptor), were subjected to further classical MD simulations for structural and dynamical characterization.\n2. Results 2.1. Docking Analysis\nFrom the blind docking approach considered for the ligand binding modes at the top of the receptor (Table 1), a total of 48 clusters for FLB, 43 resulting clusters for RACL and 33 clusters for SCH were investigated. For the same position, the FLB ligand resulted in 28 docked clusters, RACL had 19 docked positions, and SCH presented 21 clusters of potential interest.

However, only 13 docked clusters were found for the SCH ligand at D2DR\u2019s bottom position, and this number was registered as the lowest among all ligands.\nThe main D2DR residues involved in the interactions (within 2.5\u20134.1 \u00c5) with the FLB ligand (docked at the bottom part of D2DR) are LYS-191, ILE-252, GLU-189, ALA-30, -101, and -192 (Figure S1). The residues involved in the RACL\u2013D2DR interactions (at 2.1\u20133.4 \u00c5 distances) were identified as PHE (210 and 76), ILE-146, SER-230, and GLU-61 (for RACL docked at D2DR\u2019s top pocket).

The most favorable SCH-receptor interacting sites (docked at D2DR\u2019s top pocket) were described by distances ranging between 2.6 and 3.6 \u00c5 near the TRP-234 and THR-233 residues (Figure S3).

The most frequently employed residues in D2DR\u2013ligand interactions were ASN-36, ALA, THR (both 33 and 35), LEU-31, and ARG-98 for the docked positions at the bottom part of the receptor. On the other hand, the results showed that for the ligands docked at the top of D2DR, fewer residues (SER-230, GLU-61, and ILE-146) were involved."

For example, considering only the top docked positions, FLB presented an average angle value of almost 78\u25e6, while for the same docked spot, RACL had an average angle of 74.5\u25e6. A related behavior from 77.81\u25e6 (for FLB ligand) and 73.57\u25e6 (for RACL ligand) was also seen for the D2DR bottom docked position. From an intrinsic dynamical point of view, the FLB and SCH ligands presented transient stability with higher fluctuations between the 5 ns and 35 ns timescales. The RACL ligand had a starting average angle of 67.98\u25e6, and, after 20 ns, its angles significantly increased to 75.31\u25e6. However, for the SCH ligand, despite the large values, the angles were relatively stable, thereby presenting the smallest changes during the 50 ns MD run. oreover, the most significant effects on the angle distributions were seen for the FLB and RACL ligands docked at the bottom part of the receptor, where their angles ranged between 76\u201379\u25e6 (for FLB) and 68\u201375\u25e6 (for RACL).

Overall, the ligands situated at the top part of D2DR converged to higher energy patterns in comparison to the ligands situated at the bottom part of the receptor. On the other hand, the SCH ligand docked at the bottom part of D2DR showed the highest interaction energy value. Another interesting result is that for the RACL and SCH ligands docked on both receptor pockets, their opposite structural behaviors were correlated with the highest energy patterns among all ligands. Although the macromolecules\u2019 configuration depends on the known amino acid sequences and their building blocks\u2019 assembly, the ligands describing small and highly flexible molecules may exhibit distinctive shapes and topologies. As previously mentioned in Section 2.8, the ligand\u2019s configurations play a crucial role in ligand binding patterns. As a result, at the bottom docked position of the receptor, the SCH ligand presented a constant structural behavior and, therefore, was correlated with a higher binding affinity. However, for the same docked position but for the other two ligands, their partially distorted configurations due to the high flexibilities of their aliphatic chains were correlated with lower L-J-SR interactions.

For example, the same study revealed a medium affinity of [11C]RACL in high-density striatum levels and low occupancy of the same radioligand in extrastriatal regions, with low to moderate uptake of both [11C]RACL and [11C]FLB [17]. In contrast, in low-density extrastriatal regions, other studies showed high affinity of [11C]FLB for D2DR [18\u201320]. For the same compound, but in high-density regions of the striatum, the radioligand was almost impossible to quantify because it did not reach the equilibrium state within a feasible scanning time period [21,22]. The test\u2013retest data demonstrated that the [11C]RACL ligand, over time (post 29 months), presented significantly reduced levels in the frontal and temporal cortex and in the striatal areas [23]. In contrast, from the same type of measurements, the [11C]RACL radioligand presented increased binding potential indicators in the striatum, thalamus, and temporal cortex [24\u201327], therefore suggesting that the radioligand is not actually suitable for D2DR quantification in extrastriatal regions [27] and that the question regarding its reliability remains to be elucidated [17]. On the other hand, the [11C]FLB 457 ligand was correlated with highly specific binding potentials in extrastriatal areas [28]. In addition, other experimental studies concluded that the [11C]FLB radioligand is able to quantify low-density dopamine receptors as well [21,29], and is generally considered a suitable radiotracer for the cortical brain, thalamus, and other extrastriatal D2DR-binding regions [19,20,30\u201332]. It must be kept in mind that the relative uptake of these radioligands in different cerebral regions does not only depend on the receptor densities, while the regional signals also consist of free ligand in tissues and nonspecific contributions [33]. Moreover, the intravascular activities and the tracer\u2019s post-injection timescale have a direct impact on the specificity of the bindings within particular brain areas [33]. Finally, for certain disorders, the agonist treatment might also affect the receptor bindings by suppressing the hypersensitivity processes expected in that particular disorder (e.g., Parkinson\u2019s disease) [33]. In addition, the present study focuses strictly on the biophysical description of the interaction mechanism between the three ligands and one of the two major dopamine receptor subtypes (D2 subtype), including their dynamical and structural properties. The results show, in agreement with the experimental data [34], that the 11C-RACL ligand docked at the top part of the receptor is a reliable radiotracer for D2DR quantification. With slightly different energetic patterns [17], the 11C-FLB ligand can also be considered as a promising candidate for D2DR quantification [18\u201320,28], especially because, from a structural point of view, it behaves similarly to the RACL ligand. However, the 11C-SCH ligand presents a constant structural and dynamical behavior during the MD productions, with a potential affinity not only for D1 receptors but also for the D2 subtypes [10,16]."

The topology files for all the complexes (receptor and ligands) were generated using the GROningen MAchine for Chemical Simulations (GROMACS) package [43]. The CHARMM36 force field [44] was used for ions, water molecules, and D2 receptor parameters. The ligand parameters were generated using the CGenFF (CHARMM General Force Field) server [44]. The preferential binding positions were defined using a molecular docking approach [45,46]. The docking calculations were carried out on the Swiss Dock server [47], from which the obtained clusters were ranked according to their full-fitness (FF) scoring function. The results showed two preferential positions (with higher FF score absolute values) at the receptor level (top and bottom pockets) for all the ligands, totaling six docked positions considered for further investigations. The receptor\u2013ligand docked complexes were then solvated with a TIP3P water model [48]. To remove any potential steric clashes, the systems were minimized in a set of 50,000 steps using the steepest descent minimization algorithm. Moreover, chloride ions were added to neutralize each system. The receptor\u2013ligand complexes were then equilibrated for 10 ns in an NVT ensemble, where the temperature was regulated at 310 K via a modified Berendsen thermostat [49]. The temperature coupling was assigned using two separate groups (D2DR ligand with water ions) using a time constant of 0.1 ps. The last frame from the NVT ensemble was used for the following NPT equilibration for 10 ns in isotropic pressure couple type with a time constant of 1.0 ps and a reference pressure of 1 bar. The ligands were slightly restrained during both, the NVT and NPT ensembles. For each simulation, H-bond holonomically applied constraints based on the LINCS algorithm [50] were used, and the particle mesh Ewald (PME) [50] calculation method was considered for long-range electrostatic description. Furthermore, the Coulombic and van der Waals interactions were described using a cut-off distance of 12 \u00c5. Multiple MD run productions were performed with periodic boundary conditions for 50 ns using a time step of 2 fs in the NPT ensemble with no additional restrictions.

The absolute interaction energies at this level were 147.78 kJ/mol for RACL and 106.13 kJ/mol for the FLB ligand. The highest absolute interaction energy for the bottom part of the receptor was observed for the SCH ligand, while, for the top part of D2DR, the highest interaction patterns were observed for the RACL ligand. Additionally, from our predicted docked structures, the highest docking scores were seen for the RACL ligand at D2DR\u2019s top position and the FLB ligand for the opposite docked pocket. While the FLB ligand manifests the tendency to emerge out of the receptor\u2019s bottom pocket, the SCH and RACL ligands showed greater binding affinities for both receptor pockets while remaining inside of D2DR. As a consequence, the maximum solvent exposure area of 5.63 nm2 was observed for the FLB ligand docked at D2DR\u2019s bottom position. The Rg profiles for all the ligands suggested a constant behavior in the ligand compactness levels, especially for the FLB and RACL ligands, which had the same gyration average values on both D2DR docked positions. For the SCH ligand, the Rg average value slightly decreased when the two opposite docked positions were considered. The\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 2005 14 of 16\nhighest atomic RMS deviations were observed for the FLB ligand situated at the top of the receptor. Likewise, the highest interatomic distances were correlated with the same ligand but considered at both D2DR positions. For both extremities of D2DR, all the ligands showed a similar angular distribution behavior. The most significant effects on the angle distributions were seen for the FLB and RACL ligands docked at the bottom part of D2DR, although the SCH ligand presented the largest angle value distributions, but without significant structural changes. The most prominent motions extracted from the PCA measurements for the RACL ligand docked at D2DR\u2019s bottom position were triggered by the peripheral aliphatic -CH3 groups and by the -C-Cl aromatic ring groups. This type of motion led to a curved-twisted shape of the FLB and RACL ligands, which is in good agreement with their high atomic RMS fluctuations. Moreover, the QM calculations confirm this preferential top docked position of D2DR for all the ligands and identifies the RACL ligand presenting the highest complexation energy, with the SCH compound being the second most preferred ligand. Thus, according to our results, the RACL ligand docked at the top pocket of D2DR and the SCH ligand considered at the bottom part of the receptor are clearly the most efficient ligands for the modeled receptor\u2013ligand interacting complex herein. As perspectives, we consider further MD investigations with extensive production time and free energy calculations of the same docked complexes at the receptor\u2019s top docked position with the D2DR structure embedded in a phospholipid bilayer membrane.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms23042005/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization: V.C. and S.N.M.; Methodology: V.C., S.N.M. and D.-G.T.; Writing\u2014original draft preparation: S.N.M.; Writing\u2014review and editing: S.N.M. and V.C.; Funding acquisition: S.N.M. and V.C.; Supervision: V.C.
