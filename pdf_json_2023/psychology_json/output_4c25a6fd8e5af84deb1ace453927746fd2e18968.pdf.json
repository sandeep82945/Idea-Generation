    "abstractText": "Cervical cancer is a health problem among women worldwide. Considering the limitations of prevention and antineoplastic chemotherapy against cervical cancer, research is needed to discover new, more effective, and safe antitumor agents. In the present study, we investigated the in vitro cytotoxicity of a new synthetic dibenzylideneacetone derived from 1,5-diaryl-3-oxo-1,4-pentadienyl (A3K2A3) against cervical cancer cells immortalized by HPV 16 (SiHa), and 18 (HeLa) by MTT assay. Furthermore, we performed spectrofluorimetry, flow cytometry, and Western blot analyzes to explore the inhibitory mechanism of A3K2A3 in cervical cancer cells. A3K2A3 showed cytotoxic activity against both cell lines. Mitochondrial depolarization and reduction in intracellular ATP levels were observed, which may be dependent on the redox imbalance between increased ROS and reduced levels of the antioxidant defense. In addition, damage to the cell membrane and DNA, and effective blocking of cell division in the G2/M phase were detected, which possibly led to the induction of apoptosis. This result was further confirmed by the upregulation of apoptosis-related proteins Bax, cytochrome C, and caspases 9 and 3. Our results provided the first evidence that A3K2A3 contributes to the suppression of cervical cancer in vitro, showing promise as a possible alternative for the treatment of this cancer.",

            "text": "Cervical cancer is the fourth most common cancer among women worldwide, with an estimated 604,000 new cases and 342,000 deaths in 2020. More than 95% of cervical cancer cases are infection-related with high-risk for human papillomavirus (HPV) [1]. Among the high-risk HPVs, HPV16 and HPV18 are responsible for almost 70% of these cases [2,3]. In the last decade, screening for HPV lesions through HPV and Pap smear tests, and prevention through HPV vaccinations have been recognized as the most effective interventions to control the mortality rate associated with this disease [3,4]. Despite these screening and prevention programs, the incidence of cervical cancer is still one of the leading causes of cancer-related death in women [5]. This scenario may be due to the fact that screening tests are not widely available in many underdeveloped countries, a situation related to poverty and the lack of resources and infrastructure [6]. Further, vaccination is limited to young people to ensure effectiveness [7]. Even with recent advances, the clinical treatments available for cervical cancer, including radiotherapy, chemotherapy, and surgery, are still not wholly adequate due to the frequent occurrence of adverse effects, among other limitations, such as systemic toxicity and chemoresistance [8,9]. The need to identify new, more effective, and safer antitumor agents becomes clearly justifiable. In general, natural products have demonstrated advantages due to their availability and biological potential and, in recent decades, several natural products have been\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 317. https://doi.org/10.3390/antiox12020317 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/antioxidants\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 317 2 of 34\nstudied as potential anticancer drugs, either in their unmodified (natural) or modified (semi-synthetic) forms [10,11]. Chalcone and curcumin derivatives have shown relevant cytotoxic activity, in addition to the regulation of multiple signaling pathways in cancer cell lines [11\u201316]. In this sense, compounds containing these derivatives, or similar groups, in their structure are promising, leading to growing interest in the research to obtain antitumor agents. Based on structural similarities with chalcones and curcumins, dibenzylideneacetones (DBAs) were synthesized and characterized by Ud Din [17]. DBAs are a class of synthetic compounds that have an acyclic dienone attached to aryl groups at both \u03b2 positions [17]. Studies have demonstrated the therapeutic properties of DBAs, including as anticancer agents, by inhibiting STAT3 signaling, an oncogenic transcription factor that controls the expression of genes associated with oncogenesis and malignant progression in preclinical models of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and multiple myeloma (MM) [18]. DBA further exhibited antitumor activity in mice xenografted with human mucoepidermoid cells (ECM) by regulating Sp1, and Bim and t-Bid proteins without causing toxicity [19], and further inhibited cell growth and induced apoptosis in several human oral cancer cell lines [20]. Furthermore, DBAs have been observed increasing apoptosis by regulating cell survival and pro-apoptotic proteins through the activation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and CCAAT/Enhancer Binding Protein Homologous Protein (CHOP) in colon cancer cells [21]. Our research group reported that DBA (1E,4E)-2-methyl-1,5-bis(4- nitrophenyl)penta-1,4dien-3-one (A3K2A3) shows trypanocidal activity against protozoa of the genera Leishmania and Trypanosoma cruzi, and is capable of causing oxidative damage and induction of parasite cell death via necrosis and/or apoptosis [22\u201324]. There is, however, a lack of studies on cervical cancer. Considering the challenges of treating cervical cancer, and the diverse therapeutic properties already described for DBAs and their derivatives, this study was conducted with the compound A3K2A3, a new synthetic DBA, against cervical cancer cell lines (HeLa and SiHa), seeking to develop a new strategy capable of interfering with its proliferation. We further investigated the effects of this compound on different pathways (mitochondrial, oxidative, apoptotic, and necrotic) in order to understand the possible mechanism of action involved in the cell death of these cell lines. The induction of apoptosis in cancer cells is considered the main way to inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells, providing an important indication for the development of potential anticancer drugs [25,26]. Among these approaches, the modulation of ROS may represent another strategy for killing cancer cells [27] through the imbalance between antioxidant defense mechanisms and ROS production, which generates oxidative stress and can induce cell death, through apoptosis [28,29]. Another feature of programmed cell death (PCD) is the considerable cell shrinkage or decrease in cell volume that is a necessary event during the apoptosis process. In addition, the literature reports that resistance to apoptosis can be developed when cell volume reduction is avoided [30]. Our results provide the first evidence that DBA A3K2A3 contributes to the suppression of cervical cancer in vitro, as demonstrated by the selective cytotoxic effect of A3K2A3 on cancer cells and by its mechanism of action through the increased production of reactive species of oxygen and reduced levels of antioxidant defenses, which possibly contributed to apoptotic cell death."

In treatments for 48 h, the results were similar, showing an increase of 52.9% and 31.9% (IC50 and 2xIC50, respectively) in the cell population in early apoptosis and 32.9% and 62.4% in late apoptosis, respectively, with a reduction of more than 86% of viable cells. The treatment of SiHa cells for 24 h caused an increase in the percentage of cells in initial apoptosis of 2.6% and 2.7%, whereas late apoptosis increased by 10% and 32% (IC50 and 2xIC50, respectively).

Discussion\nAlthough cervical cancer screening and prevention measures help to reduce cases of\nthe disease in developed countries, in developing regions this cancer remains one of the\nmain causes of death for women [9,43,44], and considering the limitations of the current\ntreatments available, many studies are focusing on the discovery of new therapeutic ap-\nproaches that can increase the specificity and efficacy of anticancer agents to reduce ad-\nverse effects [45].

Studies have demonstrated the different therapeutic properties of DBAs and their erivatives [18\u201324,46], however, there are no reports yet of the cellular mechanism associated with anticancer activity and the biological function of the synthetic DBA A3K2A3 in cervical cancer. In this study, we inv stigated its cytotoxic activity and mechanism of action in HeLa and SiHa cervical canc r cells. A3K2A3 dose-dependently reduced the viability of both cell lines, proving the in vitro antitumoral activity of this compound. Similar data on the cytot xic activity of DBAs have alre dy been observed in oral canc r cells [20].

Additionally, A3K2A3 showed a more selective cytotoxic eff ct for cervical cancer cells compared to HaCaT. SI values > 2 indicate a likely value as an anticancer agent [47,48]. We also evaluated the cytot xic eff ct of A3K2A3 by microscopy and observed that it induced pron unced morphol gical changes in the two tested cervical cancer cells, in addition to changes in the cell membrane. In contrast, no significant morphological c anges were observed in HaCaT cells exposed to concentratio s greater than the IC50 and 2xIC50 of cancer cells for the same period of time. The reduction in cell volume was confirmed\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 317 27 of 34\nby data obtained from flow cytometry. A decrease in cell volume induces morphological changes, also constituting a characteristic of cell death by apoptosis [49]. Other studies with cancer cells showed similar changes to those found in our work and suggested a process of cell death by apoptosis [12,50]. Considering these morphological changes, we further investigated whether exposure to A3K2A3 induces oxidative stress. Oxidative stress results from the imbalance between the generation of ROS and the activity of the antioxidant system [28]. ROS is responsible for regulating several cancer-related signaling pathways, in addition to being an important regulatory signal of apoptosis in tumor cells [51]. The generation of ROS in cells exists in balance with a variety of antioxidant defenses [52]. One of the main mechanisms of resistance in tumor cells (to multiple substances, to radiation, and chemotherapeutics) when the production of ROS is increased is through the increase of antioxidant production. Several antioxidant pathways that inhibit ROS are regulated during tumor initiation and progression [53]. The antioxidant system comprises a series of enzymes that play a relevant role in the detoxification of hydroperoxides [53]. Therefore, this relationship justifies many studies, explaining cancer cell death is mediated by an increase in ROS production associated with a reduction in the levels of antioxidant defenses [54,55]. Our results showed that A3K2A3 led to an increase in the fluorescence intensity of DCF-DA in HeLa and SiHa cells, indicating a high production of ROS, which intensified after 48 h of treatment for both cell types. This excessive production possibly caused a redox imbalance leading to oxidative damage, thus exceeding the repair capacity of the antioxidant system. We demonstrated that both cells had a depletion of GSH levels, characterizing a state of oxidative stress in these cells. These results reinforce the theory that apoptosis may be the cell death pathway induced by A3K2A3, and that it is possibly a result of oxidative stress. Other tumor cell studies have also suggested that the accumulation of ROS and the reduction of GSH levels resulted in a redox imbalance, leading to the oxidation of biomolecules vital for cellular functions, and activation of apoptotic cell death pathways [11,56\u201358]. Mitochondria are a major source of intracellular ROS, and a sharp increase in their production can result in dysfunctional mitochondria and consequent reduction in ATP levels [52,59]. Depolarization of the \u2206\u03c8m is one of the main factors that contributes to the induction of apoptosis in tumor cells [50,60]. In this study, depolarization of \u2206\u03c8m was observed, in addition to a reduction in intracellular ATP levels of HeLa and SiHa cells. Studies concerning cervical cancer cells have also demonstrated depolarization of the mitochondrial membrane in which mitochondrial damage was associated with the induction of apoptosis via an intrinsic pathway [50,58]. Oxidative stress can damage cellular structures, including lipids, nucleic acids, and proteins, thus leading to DNA damage [11,48,52,61,62]. LPO affects the structural and functional integrity of cell membranes, inducing changes in their permeability, and is associated with the oxidative degradation of lipids, which are susceptible to free radicals, leading to cell membrane impairment [63]. When oxidative degradation of lipids occurs, the permeability of the membrane increases and interrupting a series of vital biochemical processes within it and eventually leading to its death [64]. In this study, A3K2A3 induced significant LPO in the two cervical cancer cell lines. Disturbances in cell membrane integrity were also demonstrated by PI labeling. These results are consistent with the data that had already been observed through the images obtained by scanning electron microscopy and are also reinforced by the images obtained in AO/PI double labeling. Thus, these findings suggest that the alterations observed in the cell membrane can collaborate in the induction of cell death. It is known that high levels of ROS can induce cellular DNA damage [29], and this damage can lead to cell cycle dysregulation followed by cell death by apoptosis [65]. Checkpoints G0/G1, S, and G2/M are crucial steps that ensure cells can progress to each phase of the cycle without any defects [66]. The presence of DNA damage can lead to failures in these checkpoints, preventing DNA replication and mitosis [67], which can\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 317 28 of 34\ntrigger apoptosis in order to eliminate abnormal cells. DNA damage, resulting from dysregulation during the cell cycle or other factors such as an increase in ROS, activates apoptotic mechanisms, which allow cellular transformation to be avoided [65]. Cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase is one of the most prominent checkpoints of many anticancer agents that can reduce cell proliferation and then induce apoptosis by inhibiting the segregation of damaged chromosomes during mitosis [67]. Our work revealed that exposure of HeLa and SiHa cells to A3K2A3 resulted in cell cycle arrest in the G2/M phase, accompanied by a decrease in cells in G0/G1, which suggests apoptosis of these cells in addition to blocking cell division in the mitotic phase. This hypothesis is supported by other studies that also reported that chalcones derivatives significantly blocked cell proliferation in the G2/M phase, helping to induce apoptosis [11,68]. Furthermore, it was consistent with Li et al. [69], in which HeLa cells treated with a lipophilic grape seed Proanthocyanidin compound (LGSP) induced an increase in ROS production and led the cells to apoptosis, in addition to generating cell cycle blockade in G2/ M. Considering the hypothesis that DNA damage in cells leads to cell cycle interruption in the G2/M phase, we further characterized this damage by analyzing chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation. It was possible to observe that the proportion of cells with condensed chromatin and fragmentation of DNA were significantly increased after treatment with A3K2A3, corroborating the apoptotic process in the two cervical cancer cell lines. Chromatin condensation and DNA degradation are considered essential steps in the characterization of apoptosis [65]. Supporting our results, DNA fragmentation and cellular chromatin condensation have previously been observed in cervical cancer cells, contributing to the confirmation of an apoptotic process [40,70]. Collectively, our data provide evidence that A3K2A3 may be inducing apoptosis in both cell types. Thus, to further confirm the cell death mechanism, Annexin-V/IP double labeling assays were performed. Our results confirmed that A3K2A3 is inducing late apoptosis in HeLa and SiHa cells, and it was more intense after treatment for 48 h. Other studies with DBAs have indicated the induction of apoptosis in several cancer cell lines [19\u201321], reinforcing our findings. In addition, the labeling of cells with AO/PI also corroborated the classification of the type of cell death, as an increase in the percentage of cells in late apoptosis (represented by the double labeling of AO/PI) was observed. Our results are in agreement with reports that cervical cancer cells treated with a fraction of Stryphnodendron adstringens revealed, by transmission electron microscopy, an intense disruption in the cell membrane, and the authors suggested a feature of late apoptosis, confirming this hypothesis by double labeling with AO /PI [40]. Finally, aiming to further explore the mechanism of apoptosis induced in the cells by A3K2A3, we evaluated the expression of some key proteins in the regulation of this cell death. Mitochondria play an important role in the apoptotic pathway of tumor cells [71]. When mitochondrial depolarization occurs, pro-apoptotic proteins are highly expressed and can result in the formation of pores in the outer membrane of mitochondria, which is controlled by the BCL-2 family, mainly by the pro-apoptotic factors Bax and the antiapoptotic factors BCL-2 [59]. The balanced relationship between pro-apoptotic and anti-apoptotic proteins regulates the process of apoptosis [72]. An increase in Bax protein levels leads to the formation of pores in the mitochondrial membrane, resulting in the release of pro-apoptotic factors into the cytosol. The BCL-2 protein prevents this release in order to protect the cell from apoptosis [73] but, due to mitochondrial depolarization caused by oxidative stress, its expression is reduced, leading to the release of cytochrome C from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm, which induces the formation of apoptotic bodies and the activation of caspase family proteins, resulting in irreversible cell death [72]. Our results showed that the expression of Bax was upregulated while the expression of Bcl-2 was downregulated, leading to the release of cytochrome C to the cytosol, thus increasing its expression which consequently led to the activation of Caspase family proteins\nAntioxidants 2023, 12, 317 29 of 34\n(Caspase- 9 and Caspase-3). These findings reinforce the hypothesis that cell exposure to A3K2A3 is probably inducing a process of cell death by apoptosis via mitochondrial damage mediated by the overproduction of ROS, with the consequent opening of transport pores, which promotes the release of pro-apoptotic agents activating the apoptosis cascade. Another study revealed that 1\u2019-acetoxyeugenol acetate (AEA) induced apoptosis in human ovarian cancer cells, activating the intrinsic pathway by inducing an increase in intracellular ROS levels, and this induction was determined by an increase in DCF-DA fluorescence intensity [74]. After the cells were exposed to A3K2A3 and subsequently induced to grow again, it was possible to assess the cell survival capacity through colony formation. We detected that A3K2A3 was able to prevent the formation of colonies, and this result is possibly related to the fact that the compound induces DNA damage and blocks cells from mitosis in the G2/M phase, preventing its multiplication. Colony formation occurs from a single cell and, therefore, when there is no colony formation, it can be indicated that the treatment induces reproductive cell death as a result of damage to the chromosomes and can lead to apoptosis [41]. Prakobwong [13,14] reported that cancer cells exposed to curcumin led to significant suppression of colony formation capacity, corroborating our results. The possible potential of A3K2A3 to prevent cell migration was investigated by evaluating wound healing and the expression of the MMP-9 protein. MMP-9 is a protein known to play a key role in cancer progression and metastasis, including cancer cell invasion, migration, and angiogenesis [5]. It was shown that A3K2A3 markedly suppressed cell migration in addition to downregulating MMP-9 expression. Our results were consistent with those found by Huang [50], who reported some synthetic compounds inhibited HeLa cell proliferation and migration. Another study, also in cervical cancer cells, demonstrated the suppression of viability, motility, and invasion by decreasing the expression of MMP-9 [5]. In general, our results showed that the action of A3K2A3 was more intense as the concentration and treatment time increased, a fact that was observed for both cell types. In addition, the results found were similar for both cervical cancer cell lines, which was expected, considering that the cells differ only in the type of HPV that modified them. Our data is supported by other studies that observed similar changes in HeLa and SiHa cells [10,40,56,67,75]. In summary, all these morphological and biochemical changes that were induced by A3K2A3 in the present study probably caused cumulative damage in the cells that are irreconcilable with cell survival. Considering the promising results found in the study by the single agent A3K2A3 another important approach in this work would be drug combination. Combined therapy has been a much-studied alternative for clinical application, seeking to achieve a synergistic effect and reduce toxicity, due to the decrease in the effective dose, leading to a possible increase in the effectiveness of the treatment [76,77]. The effects of interaction between target drugs or standard chemotherapy drugs and cytotoxic agents are little investigated [77]. It is worth mentioning that, despite all the in vitro interesting biological properties of A3K2A3 demonstrated in this work, there is no data on the interaction of this compound and standard chemotherapeutics for the treatment of cervical cancer, in previous literature. Additional studies such as combined therapy are necessary for an attempt that this association presents synergistic effects, enhancing the chemotherapeutic effect, allowing doses reduction of the drugs, as well as toxicity. In addition, an in vivo evaluation model needs to be carried out to evaluate the effective inhibition of tumor growth, in order to provide more data for the consideration of A3K2A3 as a potential candidate for cervical cancer therapy."
