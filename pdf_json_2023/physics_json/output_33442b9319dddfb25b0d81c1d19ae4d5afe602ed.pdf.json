    "abstractText": "Crocodilians are an order of ancient reptiles that thrive in pathogen-rich environments. The ability to inhabit these harsh environments is indicative of a resilient innate immune system. Defensins, a family of cysteine-rich cationic host defence peptides, are a major component of the innate immune systems of all plant and animal species, however crocodilian defensins are poorly characterised. We now show that the saltwater crocodile defensin CpoBD13 harbors potent antifungal activity that is mediated by a pH-dependent membrane-targeting action. CpoBD13 binds the phospholipid phosphatidic acid (PA) to forma large helical oligomeric complex,with specific histidine residues mediating PA binding. The utilisation of histidine residues for PA engagement allows CpoBD13 to exhibit differential activity at a range of environmental pH values, where CpoBD13 is optimally active in an acidic environment.",

The ability to inhabit these harsh environments is indicative of a resilient innate immune system. Defensins, a family of cysteine-rich cationic host defence peptides, are a major component of the innate immune systems of all plant and animal species, however crocodilian defensins are poorly characterised. We now show that the saltwater crocodile defensin CpoBD13 harbors potent antifungal activity that is mediated by a pH-dependent membrane-targeting action. CpoBD13 binds the phospholipid phosphatidic acid (PA) to forma large helical oligomeric complex,with specific histidine residues mediating PA binding. The utilisation of histidine residues for PA engagement allows CpoBD13 to exhibit differential activity at a range of environmental pH values, where CpoBD13 is optimally active in an acidic environment.\nCrocodilians are an order of ancient reptiles that have existed in their modern-day forms for approximately 83 million years1. During this time, these animals have evolved to thrive in microbe-laden environments. Yet despite regularly receivingwounds and even losing limbs in territorial disputes and interspecies conflicts, the development of infection is rare2. This unique ability to ward off pathogens before they can invade systemically is indicative of a formidable innate immune system1. A major constituent of an organism\u2019s innate immune system are defensins; a family of cysteine-rich cationic host defence peptides (CHDPs) that harbor a broad range of activities, including direct microbicidal properties and inflammatory response signalling3,4. Defensins are grouped into two major superfamilies based on their intramolecular disulphide bonds; cis-defensins (expressed by plants, fungi and invertebrates) and trans-defensins (expressedby vertebrates and invertebrates)4. Within vertebrates, the trans-defensins are further subdivided into three sub-families termed the \u03b1-, \u03b2- and \u03b8-defensins, with their distinguishing feature being the cysteine-pairing order of their disulphide bonds. While \u03b1- and \u03b8-defensins are unique to mammals and old-world primates respectively, \u03b2-defensins are the most abundant and expressed by all vertebrates4. \u03b2-defensins effectively inhibit and/or kill a wide range of pathogens including bacteria5, fungi6, viruses7 as well as tumourigenic cells8. This broad range of activities is primarily attributed to the destabilisation of the target cell plasma membrane, leading to death by lysis3,9. This mechanism of action was first characterised in plant defensins that were found to directly target and bind negatively charged phospholipids. Target phospholipids are typically members of the phosphatidylinositol phosphate (PIP) family and interact electrostatically with cationic residues of the defensin (typically arginine and lysine)10,11. Engagement of a target lipid by plant defensins triggers the formation of oligomericdefensin\u2013lipid complexeswhichplace torsional stresson the membrane until the point of lysis. Recently, this ability to target PIPs has been shown to be conserved in \u03b2-defensins, specifically human \u03b2-defensin 2 (HBD-2), which was able to kill the human pathogenic fungus Candida albicans through the binding of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PI(4,5)P2) 6. While plant and human defensins have been studied in detail6,8,10,11, the defensins of other phyla, including reptiles, are poorly characterised.

            "text": "CpoBD13 is a histidine-rich trans-defensin with pH-dependent antifungal activity To identify saltwater crocodile \u03b2-defensins, we searched C. porosus open reading frames acquired from the NCBI nucleotide database for potential defensin genes. CpoBD13, the homologue of avian \u03b2defensin-13 and Alligator sinensis \u03b2-defensin-13, was selected for further characterisation based on its unusual amino acid sequence that featured a high proportion of histidine residues (Fig. 1a). While CpoBD13 has the defining characteristics of a typical \u03b2-defensin (e.g., six conserved cysteine residues, low molecular weight, positive net charge), the abundance of histidine residues is uncommon when compared to human defensins. These characteristics are however sharedwith close CpoBD13 homologues, AsBD13 and AvBD13 from the Chinese alligator and chicken, respectively (Fig. 1b).\nConsidering the known antifungal and anticancer activities of plant and human defensins, we examined the effect of recombinantly expressed CpoBD13 against the human pathogenic fungus C. albicans and an array of human primary and tumourigenic cell lines. In growth inhibition assays using C. albicans, CpoBD13 inhibited fungal growth in a concentration-dependent manner with an IC50 value of 4.1 \u00b5M (Fig. 1c). Furthermore, CpoBD13 was tolerant of salt and retained antifungal activity in NaCl concentrations of 100mM (Supplementary Fig. 1a). To determine if the antifungal activity of CpoBD13 against C. albicans was a direct result of membrane perturbation, we performed flow cytometry-based membrane-permeabilisation assays monitoring the uptake of the membrane-impermeable dye PI (Fig. 1d). CpoBD13 permeabilised fungal cell membranes in a concentration-dependent manner. In contrast, CpoBD13 did not affect the viability of both primary and tumourigenic human cell lines inMTT andMTS assays at the assessed concentrations (Fig. 1e). The inability to kill tumourigenic cells was not a result of serum inactivation as CpoBD13 was unable to effectively permeabilise U937 cells in serum-free media (Supplementary Fig. 1b).\nWith five histidine residues present in its amino acid sequence (comprising ~13% of the mature sequence), the net charge of CpoBD13 is significantly altered by the pH of its surrounding environment (Fig. 1f). As the pKa of histidine is 6.0, the charge of CpoBD13 can increase from +3 (at pH 7.5) to pH +8 (at pH 5.5), we surmised that changes in the net charge of CpoBD13may impact its functionality. To assess if changes in the environmental pH modify the membranepermeabilising activity of CpoBD13, we repeated the PI uptake assays in buffered media (Fig. 1g). At pH 5.5, the approximate pH of the standard assay in Fig. 1d, CpoBD13 was highly effective at permeabilising the fungal cells. As the pH increased to 6.5, however, CpoBD13 activity was significantly reduced, with the most dramatic loss of activity observed at pH 7.5. These results indicate that the ability for CpoBD13 to permeabilise fungal plasma membranes is pH-dependent and that optimal efficacy is achieved in an acidic environment.\nTo visualise fungal membrane-targeting and membrane permeabilisation, we treated C. albicans with fluorescently labelled CpoBD13 and observed the process by confocal microscopy (Fig. 1h). CpoBD13 accumulated at the fungal cell membrane before permeabilising the\ncell membrane, indicated by the appearance of PI fluorescence within the cell. Interestingly, for budding yeast and neighbouring cells in contact with one another, CpoBD13-BODIPY was often observed to accumulate at points of cell-cell contact (Fig. 1i, Supplementary Movie 1). Of the total cell to cell contact points in view, ~30% showed accumulation of CpoBD13-BODIPY (Supplementary Fig. 1c).\nCpoBD13 binds to and oligomerises with the phospholipid phosphatidic acid The ability of human and plant defensins to target lipid bilayers has been attributed to direct phospholipid recognition and binding. To determine if CpoBD13 functions in the same manner, we assessed which phospholipids, if any, CpoBD13 interacts with. Haemagglutinin (HA)-tagged CpoBD13 in lipid overlay assays on PIP Strips (Fig. 2a) bound only to PA, with no clear binding detected for other lipids. We then examined CpoBD13 binding to PA in a physiologically relevant context by performing liposome-binding assays (Fig. 2b). Prepared phosphatidylcholine (PC) only and PC:PA liposomes were incubated with CpoBD13 before being separated into bound and unbound fractions. We found that CpoBD13 preferentially bound to PA-enriched liposomes, whereas only negligible binding to the PC only liposomes was observed. Furthermore, CpoBD13 lysed PC:PA liposomes as determined by measuring the release of calcein from calceinencapsulated PC only and PC:PA liposomes (Fig. 2c). While PC only liposomes were also observed to lyse, there was a significant increase in the lysis of PC:PA liposomes.\nThe ability to bind and oligomerise with specific phospholipids has been well documented in other defensins, particularly those from plants, which belong to the cis-defensins and adopt large intricate protein:phospholipid oligomeric complexes. In contrast, whilst transdefensins (such as those found in humans) have been shown to bind phospholipids, the atomic detail of putative large oligomeric defensin:phospholipid complexes remain to be determined6,10,11. Consequently, we subjectedCpoBD13 to chemical crosslinking analysis in the presence and absence of PA (Fig. 2d). In the absence of the crosslinker BS(PEG)5 and PA, CpoBD13 is found primarily in a monomeric state. After the addition of BS(PEG)5, clear dimers are observed at 0 and 23 \u00b5MPAconcentrations.At 115 \u00b5MPA,multiple higher order bands are clearlyobservable, indicative ofmultimeric complexes up to the size of pentamers. To visualise the morphology of these higher order complexes, samples of CpoBD13, PA only and CpoBD13:PA were examined by transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (Fig. 2e). CpoBD13:PA complexes formed large sheet-like structures thatwere vastly different to the fibrils that have been observed in plant defensins10,11. In contrast, for CpoBD13 alone these structures were absent, although smaller fragmented sheets were infrequently encountered. This indicates that these structures may form in the absence of PA, however, not to the same scale and extent. In contrast, no such structureswere observed in PA-only samples. Additionally, CpoBD13 did not form any observable structures when paired with PC (Supplementary Fig. 2a). Further investigation into the structural stability of the defensin-lipid complexes revealed these structures are disrupted in reducing conditions (Supplementary Fig. 2b).\nCpoBD13\u2013PA interactions are mediated by arginine and histidine residues To understand the structural basis of CpoBD13 activity, we determined its atomic structure using X-ray crystallography. A single copy of CpoBD13 was found in the asymmetric unit, with clear and continuous density observed for the entire protein chain. CpoBD13 adopts a fold comprising the family-defining structural elements observed in mammalian \u03b2-defensins comprising a single \u03b1-helix and a three-stranded \u03b2sheet, which are connected via three disulphide bonds. A Dali analysis of CpoBD13 revealed that human \u03b2-defensin-2 (HBD-2) is the closest structural homologue in the Protein Data Bank (PDB), with a rmsd of\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:1170 2\n0.8 \u00c5 (Z-score 6.2) over 40C\u03b1 atoms, and a peptide sequence identity of 26% (only I26 and K38 are conserved in addition to the cysteine residues that form the structurally critical disulphide bonds).\nAn overlay of the two defensin structures (Fig. 3a) revealed that residue H35 of CpoBD13 was located in the same position as the key lipid binding residue K36 in HBD-2. We surmised that if the activity of CpoBD13 is as conserved with HBD-2 as its tertiary structure, the co-localisation of these amino acids could indicate that histidine may play a role in CpoBD13\u2013lipid interactions. However, considering the diversity of phospholipid binding sites found across defensins, CpoBD13 may not necessarily use a previously observed interaction mode with PA. Consequently, we determined the structure of a CpoBD13:PA complex, which was refined to a resolution of 1.45 \u00c5. The asymmetric unit features four CpoBD13 protomers and four PA\n0 20 40 60 80100 0\n20 40 60 80\n100\nConcentration (\u03bcM)\nPI po\nsi tiv\nity (%\n)\npH 5.5 pH 6.5 pH 7.5 5 6 7 8 9 0 2 4 6 8\n10\npH\nN et\nch ar\nge\n0 10 20 30 40 50 0\n20 40 60 80\n100\nConcentration (\u03bcM) PI\npo si\ntiv ity\n(% )\n0 20 40 60 80100 0\n20 40 60 80\n100 120\nConcentration (\u03bcM)\nC el\nlv ia\nbi lit\ny ( %\n)\nAHDF HUVEC HeLa PC3 U937\n0 2 4 6 8 10 0\n20 40 60 80\n100 120\nConcentration (\u03bcM)\nFu ng\nal gr\now th\n(% )\na\nd\n+8\n+5 +3\nCpoBD13 MRLLYLLFAAVMLLFLQAVPANGSYYSTLQCRNNHGHCRRLCFHGEQWIGNCNGRHQHCCK Mature domainSignal sequence\n10 20 30 40 50 60 ....|....|....|....|....|....|....|....|....|....|....|....|....|..\nCpoBD13 SYYSTLQCRNNHGHCRRLCFHGEQWIGNCNGRHQHCCK----------------------------AsBD13 SYYSTLQCRSNHGHCRRLCFHGERWIGNCNGGHQHCCK----------------------------AvBD13 -FSDSQLCRNNHGHCRRLCFHMESWAGSCMNGRLRCCRFSTKQPFSNPKHSVLHTAEQDPSPSLGGT\nb\nc\ng\ne\nf\nh 0 s 80 s 340 s 640 s\ni 2 min 10 min 20 min 30 min\nBrightfield\nCpoBD13 BODIPY\nMerge\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:1170 3\nmolecules (Fig. 3b). Examination of the mode of engagement of PA with the different CpoBD13 chains revealed the presence of two different PA binding sites. The type II site (Fig. 3d, f) involves contacts of R17 and H35 with the phosphate of the PA headgroup. An additional contact is formed with N28 and a carboxyl group of the acyl chain. Notably, all three contact residues are provided by a single CpoBD13 protomer.\nIn contrast, the type I site (Fig. 3c, e) features contributions from three different CpoBD13 chains. N30 from chain A and H21 from chain B contact the phosphate of the PA headgroup. Furthermore, the crystallographic symmetry mate of chain B (denoted as B\u2019) also contributes via R9 binding to the PA headgroup. Three additional contacts are formed by S1 from chain A, which forms hydrogen bonds with two oxygen atoms in the acyl chains of PA and\nthe linking oxygen with the phosphate headgroup. Whilst the asymmetric unit does not contain an obvious large oligomeric CpoBD13:PA complex (as observed using negative stain TEM (Fig. 2e), examination of the crystal lattice reveals that PA groups bound in type I sites make contacts across neighbouring asymmetric units, in the process creating a continuous left-handed single stranded helical chain of CpoBD13 protomers connected via PA molecules (Fig. 3g).\nThe antifungal activity of CpoBD13 is dependent on PA-binding residues To further understand the role of PA interactions for CpoBD13 activity, we performed structure-guided mutagenesis on key residues involved in the proposed type I (R9 and H21) and type II (R17 and H35)\nFig. 1 | CpoBD13 is a histidine-rich\u03b2-defensin that permeabilises C. albicans in a pH-dependent manner. a Full-length peptide sequence of CpoBD13.

This pattern in activity was reflected in PI uptake assays with CpoBD13 (H21A) being the least effective at permeabilising C. albicans cell membranes followed by CpoBD13 (R17A) (Fig. 4c). In contrast, the remainingmutants displayed activity comparable to wild type CpoBD13. We then repeated these experiments at pH 5.5 and 7.5 to identify if any specific residues were important for regulating membranolytic activity at different pH values (Fig. 4d).

Both arginine mutants showed a significant reduction in their PA binding capability whereas it was unchanged for the histidine mutants when compared to the wild type. At a pH of 5.5, the ability of CpoBD13 (R9A) and CpoBD13 (R17A) to bind PA was recovered with no significant difference observed compared to CpoBD13 (Fig. 4f). CpoBD13 (H21A) was the least effective at binding\nPA at pH 5.5, whereas the remaining histidine mutants showed no significant differences to the wild type.\nTo establish if the differences in PA binding are reflected in the lytic activity of the mutants, we again treated PA-enriched liposomes and monitored calcein-release (Fig. 4g). The results of the liposome lysis followed the same trend observed in the pH 7.4 pulldown (Fig. 4e) with a significant decrease in lysis for CpoBD13 (R9A) and CpoBD13 (R17A), relative to wild type CpoBD13. In contrast, the histidine mutants showed no significant change, except for CpoBD13 (H21A), which showed a minor yet statistically significant decrease in activity.

In total, five compound mutant defensins were recombinantly expressed to investigate two aspects of the defensin\u2019s activities (Fig. 5a), the pH sensitivity and overall antifungal activity. Compound mutants were divided into two groups: the first group (i) included alanine substitutions of identified type I residues (CpoBD13 (Type I)) or type II residues (CpoBD13 (Type II)), and CpoBD13 (R17A/H21A) which contained alanine substitutions of the most important single residues (in terms of antifungal activity) from both binding pockets. Thesepeptidesweredesigned to determine if the defensin\u2019s antifungal activity is a result of the identified PA binding residues working in combination. The second group (ii) included CpoBD13 (H21A/H35A) and CpoBD13 (H21R/H35R) which were designed to remove the charge or induce a persistent positive charge, respectively, in the position of the original histidine residues proposed to contact PA. These modificationswouldhelp in assessing if the pH-sensitivity of CpoBD13was a result of the cumulative effect of both histidine residues.\nTo determine the consequence of each compound mutation on the antifungal activity of CpoBD13, we assessed their ability to inhibit the growth of C. albicans (Fig. 5b). There was a significant decrease in the growth inhibitory effect of all five compound mutations when comparing their respective IC50 values to wild type peptide (Fig. 5c).\nBoth CpoBD13 (Type I) and CpoBD13 (H21R/H35R) showed an approximate 2-fold increase whereas, CpoBD13 (Type II), CpoBD13 (R17A/H21A) and CpoBD13 (H21A/H35A) presented a ~2.5-fold increase in IC50.\nAs single amino acid substitutions had little effect on the pH sensitivity of CpoBD13, we assessed the ability of the double histidine substitution mutants CpoBD13 (H21A/H35A) and CpoBD13 (H21R/ H35R) to permeabilise fungal cell membranes at pH 5.5 and 7.5 (Fig. 5d). At pH 5.5, CpoBD13 (H21A/H35A) was ineffective at killing C. albicans, with only ~30% of fungal cells permeabilised at the highest concentration tested. In contrast, CpoBD13 (H21R/H35R) had greater membranolytic activity andwas able topermeabilise ~75%of the fungal cells at 50 \u00b5M. Furthermore, when the pH was adjusted to pH 7.5, neither mutant showed a significant difference in activity when compared to pH 5.5, indicating that the antifungal activities of the compound histidine mutants were not regulated by the surrounding pH."

            "text": "The structure\u2013function relationships of human and plant defensins have been well documented. These CHDPs target and destabilise the plasma membranes of a broad range of microbial organisms and, in certain cases, tumourigenic cells by interacting with negatively charged phospholipids6,8,10. While reptilian defensin genes have been identified from the genomes of species such as the Komodo dragon12, Chinese turtle13 and recentlymembers of the crocodilian family14,15, the same depth of structural and mechanistic insight has not been obtained in comparison to their human and plant counterparts.\nIn this study, we characterised the antifungal activity of the saltwater crocodile \u03b2-defensin CpoBD13 and discovered that the ability to bind anionic phospholipids, specifically phosphatidic acid, has been evolutionarily conserved by reptilians.

(b\u2013d) Source data are provided as a Source Data file.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:1170 7\ndimensional crystal structure of a reptilian defensin in complex with PA, we identified that the binding of PA is mediated by key histidine residues that regulate the membranolytic activity of the peptide in a manner dependent on the environmental pH. To our knowledge, this phenomenon has not been observed for any characterised defensin.\nCpoBD13 displayed antifungal activity against the model pathogenic yeast C. albicans, which is mediated via accumulation at the cell membrane prior to cell lysis (Fig. 1c, d, h and i). While some defensins also target tumourigenic cells8,16,17, CpoBD13 was not effective at reducing the viability of any of the mammalian cells assayed (Fig. 1e). Recently, a truncated form of CpoBD13 was shown to have minimal antibacterial activity against biofilms of the Gram-positive and Gramnegative bacteria, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, respectively18. Collectively, these data suggest that CpoBD13 selectively targets fungal cells.\nThe antifungal activity of CpoBD13 is regulated by the environmental pH and has optimal activity at acidic pH. Its ability to permeabilise fungalmembranes improves as the net charge of the peptide increases.While this is the first defensin determined to be pH-sensitive based on direct histidine-mediated lipid binding, the ability for pH to modulate membranolytic activity has been previously observed19,20. It has also been documented that histidine residues can regulate the activity of CHDPs. For example, by substituting integral lysine residues with histidine in the membranolytic peptide LL-1, the peptide was engineered to kill the human adenocarcinomic alveolar basal epithelial cells (A549) in apH-dependentmanner21. ForCpoBD13, this in-built pHsensitivity could be a mechanism that allows the peptide to be stored or transported in a low-activity state within the crocodile when maintained in a neutral pH to help prevent harm to the host. However, once CpoBD13 reached an acidic pH at the site of an infection (e.g. Candida blastophores favour acidic pH in humans22), the peptide could be activated and clear target pathogens.\nThe membranolytic activity of CpoBD13 is a result of binding PA within target cell plasmamembranes, as demonstrated by its ability to bind and permeabilise PA-enriched liposomes (Fig. 2a\u2013c). PA is an important signalling molecule involved in pH sensing and membrane fusion within budding yeast and accounts for 4% of the total plasma membrane23. Our crystal structure of CpoBD13 bound to PA (Fig. 3b) confirmed the presence of histidine residues within the proposed type I (Fig. 3c, e) and type II (Fig. 3d, f) PA-binding sites.We identifiedH21 as themost important residue for CpoBD13 antifungal activity (Fig. 4a\u2013c) with H21 also involved in the pH-mediated binding of PA (Fig. 4f, g). The fungal growth inhibitory activity of CpoBD13 (H21A) resembled that of the compound mutant CpoBD13 (Type I), indicating that PA interactions through the type I site are largely reliant on H21 alone (Fig. 4a and Fig. 5b). While H21 is clearly important for CpoBD13 activity, CpoBD13 (H21A) retains some capacity to inhibit fungal growth and bind PA. Compound mutations in the type II PA-binding site and of R17/H21 decreased the antifungal activity of the defensin to a greater extent than their respective single amino acid substitutions alone, suggesting that PA binding residues are contributing collectively to the overall CpoBD13 activity (Fig. 5a\u2013c). Furthermore, the pHsensitivity of CpoBD13 is a result of H21 and H35 working in tandem. While alanine substitution of the individual residues did not alter the defensin\u2019s ability to modify its activity based on the environmental pH (Fig. 4d), when both residues were substituted, the membranolytic activity of CpoBD13 (H21A/H35A) did not improve in an acidic environment (Fig. 5d). This was also true of CpoBD13 (H21R/H35R) however the inclusion of arginine residues in position 21 and 35 had the opposite effect to CpoBD13 (H21A/H35A), in that it was able to retain its membranolytic activity when the pH was increased from 5.5 to 7.5, further highlighting the importance of charge-based interactions with PA for the defensin to permeabilise fungal cells (Fig. 5d).\nAs shown in Fig. 2d, the binding of PA also triggers the formation of CpoBD13:PA oligomers. When observed using TEM (Fig. 2e), the\nCpoBD13:PA oligomeric complexes resembled clusters of long, sheetlike structures; a morphology vastly different to the defensin\u2013lipid fibrils produced by the plant defensins NaD1 and NsD710,11. As there are no other reported TEM images of \u03b2-defensin:lipid oligomers to date, it is currently unknown if the CpoBD13:PA sheet-like morphology observed is representative for \u03b2-defensins. However, it is likely that these structures are exaggerated versions of smaller physiological membrane disruption complexes that are generated only within localised regions of the fungal membrane upon accumulation of CpoBD13 to those regions enrichedwith PA. Examination of the crystal structure of the CpoBD13:PA complex and the presence of a continuous left-handed single-stranded helical chain formed between the defensin protomers raises the possibility that multiple single strands could orientate parallel to one another, forming the observed oligomeric sheets. It remains unclear whether the oligomerisation of CpoBD13 is a crucial step in the membrane permeabilisation of target cells as there was no clear difference in oligomerisation between the assessed mutants (Fig. 4h), even for CpoBD13 (H21A) that showed the greatest reduction in membranolytic activity.\nOverall, our findings reveal that the structure and lipid-binding capability of \u03b2-defensins have been conserved from the divergence of humans and reptiles to the present day. Intriguingly, the structure of our CpoBD13:PA complex revealed the existence of large and continuous helical oligomers. Whilst phospholipid binding has been previously shown for other trans-defensins such as HBD-2 and HBD-3, the atomic architecture of postulated trans-defensin:phospholipid oligomeric membrane attack complexes remained unresolved to date. Our structural analysis of CpoBD13:PA provides a first glimpse into the architecture of a trans-defensin:phospholipid oligomeric complex. Considering the conserved location of key interacting residues between HBD-2 and CpoBD13, this may provide a clue as to the possible architecture of HBD-2 oligomeric assemblies or those involving other related trans-defensins. Our findings suggest that despite having arisen independently during evolution, both cis- and trans-defensins are capable of forming highly ordered large oligomeric membrane permeabilising structures with specific phospholipids. Furthermore, the observed pH-dependent membranolytic activity of CpoBD13 suggests that reptiles are capable of regulating defensin activities using a naturally occurring \u2018histidine-switch\u2019 mechanism, whereby the charge of histidine residues can be utilised to turn antifungal activity on and off depending on the environmental pH. These data may inform the engineering of pH-dependent CHDPs for therapeutic purposes."
