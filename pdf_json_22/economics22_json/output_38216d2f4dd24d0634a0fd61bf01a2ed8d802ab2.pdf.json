    "abstractText": "Context: Online grocery services are an emerging component of the food system with the potential to address disparities in access to healthy food. Objective: We assessed the barriers and facilitators of equitable access to healthy foods in the online grocery environment, and the psychosocial, purchasing, and dietary behaviors related to its use among low-income, diverse populations. Data Sources: Four electronic databases were searched to identify relevant literature; 16 studies were identified. Results: Barriers to equitable access to healthy food included cost and limited availability of online grocery services in food deserts and rural areas. The expansion of online grocery services and the ability to use nutrition assistance benefits online were equity-promoting factors. Perceived low control over food selection was a psychosocial factor that discouraged online grocery use, whereas convenience and lower perceived stress were facilitators. Findings were mixed regarding healthfulness of foods purchased online. Although few studies assessed diet, healthy food consumption was associated with online grocery use. Conclusion: Researchers should assess the impact of online grocery shopping on low-income families\u2019 food purchases and diet. Systematic Review Registration: PROSPERO registration no.

Objective: We assessed the barriers and facilitators of equitable access to healthy foods in the online grocery environment, and the psychosocial, purchasing, and dietary behaviors related to its use among low-income, diverse populations. Data Sources: Four electronic databases were searched to identify relevant literature; 16 studies were identified. Results: Barriers to equitable access to healthy food included cost and limited availability of online grocery services in food deserts and rural areas. The expansion of online grocery services and the ability to use nutrition assistance benefits online were equity-promoting factors. Perceived low control over food selection was a psychosocial factor that discouraged online grocery use, whereas convenience and lower perceived stress were facilitators. Findings were mixed regarding healthfulness of foods purchased online. Although few studies assessed diet, healthy food consumption was associated with online grocery use.

Online grocery shopping is a new and growing component of the food system that addresses barriers related to physical access to healthy foods. In 2018, 34% of US shoppers reported purchasing groceries online at least sometimes.13 Of those, 30% were from low-income households (< $40 000 annual household income) and 64% were parents with children.13 In the United States, from January 2020 to January 2021, online retail sales increased by 39%.14 Specifically for families living in low-income areas who may lack access to grocery stores and personal vehicles,15 online grocery services have the potential to address barriers related to transportation. However, many underserved families have not been able to realize the benefits of online grocery shopping, due to disparities in technology access16 and digital literacy,17 limited delivery services,18 delivery and membership fees, and minimum order policies.19\nThe 2014 Farm Bill mandated a pilot program with food retailers to test the feasibility of allowing the use of Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits as payment for online grocery orders.18 The ability to use the SNAP Electronic Benefits Transfer card online may address barriers related to physical access to healthy foods and the card provides an alternative payment method for purchasing groceries online for low-income households. Additionally, during the COVID-19 pandemic, online purchasing became a safe, socially distanced option to purchase groceries, which motivated the rapid expansion of the SNAP Online Purchasing Pilot (OPP) to 48 states and additional retailers.20 The SNAP OPP expansion marked an important change in online grocery access among lowincome populations in the United States: redemption of government benefits online increased to 67 times the amount of prepandemic redemptions.21 Although increasing use of online grocery services has the potential to improve access to healthy foods, understanding barriers to its use and possible unintended consequences of online grocery shopping on food purchases and dietary habits among low-income and diverse populations is critical for the development of health- and equitypromoting policies.\nIn a previous scoping review, Jilcott Pitts et al22 described barriers and motivators to online grocery shopping. However, few studies included in the review focused on diverse populations from low-income backgrounds, which are at greatest risk for health and social disparities. Furthermore, the Jilcott Pitts et al22 review was conducted before the implementation of the OPP and the COVID-19 pandemic. Since then, online grocery shopping has become more accessible and additional studies on the topic have been published. In the present systematic review, we aimed to synthesize the existing evidence of the perceptions about and impact of online grocery shopping on low-income and diverse populations and to identify opportunities to inform policy and promote equity in the online food retail space. Therefore, using an equity lens, we examined online grocery shopping behaviors among diverse, low-income populations and aimed to answer the following questions: (1) What are the barriers to and enablers of equitable access to healthy food in online grocery services? (2) What are the psychosocial, purchasing, and dietary behaviors associated with online grocery service use among families from low-income backgrounds?"

In turn, the online food environment influences and is influenced by an individual\u2019s perception of barriers, attitudes, and intentions to purchase groceries online, in line with the theory of planned behavior.29\nEquity in online grocery shopping refers to the differential impact of policies and retailers\u2019 practices (ie, disparate cost of grocery items online vs in the store19) on online grocery shopping uptake and healthy food selection among rural and urban populations,18 and groups of different ages, incomes, and races or ethnicities.39 Five studies included in this review highlighted the importance of reducing deterrents to online grocery shopping to increase uptake and improve the quality of foods purchased by low-income, racially or ethnically diverse populations.18,19,32,39,40 Disparate cost of equivalent grocery items at online retailers was reported in 1 study, in comparison with brick-and-mortar vendors in low-income neighborhoods in the United Sates40 In another study, authors motivated by the SNAP OPP found that grocery ordering and delivery services were rarely available in rural food deserts.18 Researchers who\nTable 1 PICOS criteria for inclusion and exclusion of studies\nParameter Inclusion criteria Exclusion criteria\nGeneral Published in English Peer-reviewed publication Study design Experimental, cross-sectional, quasi-experimental, qualitative, natural experiments, mixed methods\nReviews, abstracts\nPopulation Low-income (defined as living in poverty, food insecure, participating in supplemental assistance nutrition programs [SNAP or WIC]) and/or racially or ethnically diverse populations Intervention/exposure Online ordering of groceries (supermarkets, grocery stores, farmers\u2019 markets) Setting Urban and rural settings Not real-world setting (ie, ordering from laboratory that does not deliver the groceries selected) Outcomes Psychosocial, purchasing, diet behaviors, or equity promotion in online grocery environment Abbreviations: SNAP, Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program;

Additionally, 3 studies recommended that the US Department of Agriculture allow the use of WIC benefits online as a\nmeans to increase social and economic resources to improve food access for disadvantaged groups.34,36,38\nIn 3 studies, researchers pilot tested approaches to increase healthy options in the online grocery environment among socially disadvantaged communities.12,31,35 One intervention (Virtual Supermarket Program) facilitated grocery delivery and SNAP payment at community hubs for low-income, urban older adults.12 Participants placed and received grocery orders in designated hubs, including public libraries, schools, and senior housing centers.12 The Internet Grocery Service tested the feasibility of a grocery delivery service to increase access to healthy foods in a low-income urban food desert by providing vouchers for groceries and delivery fees.31 Last, an intervention in rural communities tested the feasibility of an online produce market where participants redeemed Fruit and Vegetable Prescription Program vouchers and picked up orders from a community site.35\nPsychosocial factors of the TPB related to online grocery shopping\nIn 10 studies included in this review, authors assessed psychosocial behaviors related to online grocery shopping.

Some authors reported a lack of interest in or low perceived benefit of online shopping.24,37 In others, participants expressed interest in online grocery services, although most seemed to view it as an occasional convenience rather than a complete substitute for instore shopping.31,36,38 For example, after the Internet Grocery Service intervention, 54.5% of participants responded that they would use the service 1\u20136 times per year, 24.3% said they would use it at least monthly, and only 9.1% reported they would never use it in the future.31\nConcerns about control over food selection emerged as a major barrier to uptake of online grocery services,19,24,36,37 particularly with regard to the quality of fresh items37 and the potential for losing money on unsatisfactory purchases.19 Perceived high cost of online grocery shopping was another barrier to its uptake by underserved families. The potential for losing money on unsatisfactory purchases was a main concern19,36,37; participants cited fees and the relative paucity of deals online compared with in-store purchases as disincentives for online shopping.36 Additionally, the lack of social interaction during grocery shopping was another reported deterrent to online shopping, although some participants felt that the benefits offset the loss.38\nOnline grocery ordering was perceived to be less stressful than in-store grocery shopping among women with children enrolled in WIC, because it eliminated the need for transportation and addressed the challenges of shopping in a store with children.38 Although the evidence supporting reduced impulse purchases when shopping online is mixed,23,36 participants also felt that online grocery shopping might result in fewer impulse buys of both unhealthy (eg, sweet snacks and chips) and sometimes healthy (eg, fruits) foods, compared with in-store purchases.38 Additional benefits of online grocery services identified by participants included saving time and delivery of heavy or bulky items.19\nBoth perceived behavioral control and normative beliefs positively influenced use of online grocery shopping during an intervention that was co-created by residents of a low-income housing community and researchers.19 Participants reported that ordering groceries online was easier than they had anticipated,19 a finding that was echoed by mothers participating in WIC in another study.36 Participants also noted that although they were generally wary of online shopping, they trusted residents of their community and were willing to try the online grocery pilot.19\nPurchasing and diet behaviors related to online grocery shopping\nOf the 11 studies in which researchers assessed online food purchasing behaviors,12,19,23,24,31,32,34\u201336,39,41 consumer purchasing data were collected from itemized store receipts in 7 studies,19,24,31,32,34,36,41 from online data monitoring in 1 study,35 from stakeholder interviews and document review from a retailer in 1 study,39 and were self-reported in 2 studies,12,35\nIn 2 studies, authors quantitatively assessed impulse buying during online grocery shopping.23,36 Participants in 1 study purchased more on impulse online than they did when shopping in a store, although not all impulse buys were unhealthy.36 In another study, Coffino et al23 did not find a difference in impulse purchases between consumers who received nutrition education (the control condition) and those who received the healthy-default shopping-cart intervention.23\nThe impact of online grocery shopping on nutritional quality of purchases was mixed. A healthy-default shopping cart increased the healthfulness of food purchases and decreased fat, sodium, and cholesterol from foods purchased,23 and led to greater overall nutritional quality.41 The most frequently purchased items in the Internet Grocery Service pilot were animal proteins, fruits and vegetables, and caloric beverages.31 SNAP Electronic Benefits Transfer online purchases were higher in sweet and salty snacks and lower in fruits than non-SNAP online purchases in a study24 and had greater nutritional quality. In other studies, researchers were limited in their ability to quantitatively assess the impact of online grocery services on the healthfulness of food purchases, because of low uptake of online grocery shopping. For example, after a planned randomized controlled trial of online ordering failed due to low uptake, Martinez et al24 pivoted to a mixedmethods design to understand low use of online services. Cohen et al19 did not report on the food types that were purchased but noted that online orders made up a small percentage of dollars spent on food ( 3.1%).\nDietary intake was assessed in only 2 studies. In 1 study, authors assessed changes in daily servings of fruits and vegetables among children and their caregivers in response to an online food-market program.35 The online program resulted in improved self-reported fruit and vegetable intake among children and decreased household food insecurity.35 No dietary change was observed among caregivers. In the other study, selfreported intake data related to the Virtual Supermarket Program were collected.12 Customers reported purchasing more fruits and vegetables and sugary drinks since the start of the virtual program. They also attributed\n1306 Nutrition ReviewsVR Vol. 80(5):1294\u20131310\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nutritionreview s/article/80/5/1294/6514637 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\neating more healthfully and perceived having greater access to affordable foods due to the program.12"

            "text": "In this systematic review, we examined the potential for online grocery services to promote equitable access to healthy foods among underserved populations. Interest in the topic has grown substantially over the past few years, as evidenced by the burgeoning research and the SNAP OPP. Perceived barriers and TPB constructs associated with online grocery shopping identified in this systematic review focusing on low-income, diverse populations are consistent with findings from a previous scoping review.22 Furthermore, the perspective afforded by the equity-oriented framework advanced the understanding of the main deterrents to online grocery shopping among low-income and diverse populations (eg, perceived high cost) and identified promising strategies to build on community capacity (eg, improving customer control over online purchases), opportunities to improve social and economic resources for food access (eg, allowing use of government benefits online), and strategies to increase healthy grocery options (eg, expanding online ordering and delivery services of healthy food vendors). This investigation identified low availability of online grocery services in rural communities, perceived high costs, and perceived low behavioral control over food selection as important barriers to uptake of online grocery services by disadvantaged groups, which could widen inequities in access to healthy food. The ability to pay for groceries online with SNAP benefits was a motivator,24,31 making an important case for future research on the expansion of the US Department of Agriculture online purchase pilot to other programs such as WIC and the Fruit and Vegetable Prescription Program. Pilot interventions tested strategies to improve healthy-food purchasing that could be incorporated into existing online grocery programs, including the default healthyfood online grocery cart,23,41 and centralized delivery locations like public libraries and schools in hard-toreach communities.12,19,35 More research is needed on the feasibility of the use of other government benefits (eg, WIC, Fruit and Vegetable Prescription Program) in the online grocery environment as a means to improve social and economic resources for access to healthy food. Furthermore, researchers should examine and compare the cost-effectiveness of creating hubs for community grocery pick-up, expanding delivery buffers, and/or creating more supermarkets, with a particular focus on rural communities. Partnership with community centers and retailers to create community\nhubs and reduce delivery fees may be a promising strategy to improve access to healthy foods. The few studies in which online food purchasing and dietary behaviors were examined among underserved populations reported potential increases in both unhealthier and healthier food choices. Fewer impulse purchases and reduced influence of children on parents\u2019 buying behavior (ie, \u201cpester power\u201d) in the online environment are possible mechanisms to explain fewer unhealthy food purchases online. These findings are also supported by the multiple selves theory, because ordering groceries for delivery in the (relatively) distant future predicts more healthy food choices (should-self), whereas immediate purchases predicts more unhealthier food choices (want-self).42,43 Conversely, the potential for targeted online marketing and personalized recommendations have been hypothesized to increase unhealthy food purchases online.44,45 Although, to our knowledge, the effect of online marketing on unhealthy food selection has not been empirically tested, various simulated, online-grocery, experimental studies have demonstrated that targeted online marketing of healthy foods and provision of nutrition information were promising strategies to improve quality of foods purchased in the virtual environment.46\u201348 On the other hand, there is plausible evidence that food and beverage industries have disproportionately targeted marketing of unhealthy items to low-income, diverse populations across media markets.49\u201351 Authors of a 2013 study, which was outside the scope of the present review, assessed the nutritional quality of Bronx, NY\u2013based grocery store circulars available online and found that >84% of products advertised on the first page were processed.52 The influence of grocery store circulars on online grocery purchases merits further investigation. Given the potential for personalized online marketing of unhealthy foods in the online grocery environment, there is a need to better understand existing online marketing in the virtual grocery environment and to explore avenues for interventions to support selection of healthy foods online among underserved populations.\nOne mechanism that could explain greater purchases of healthy items online is through future episodic thinking, which is required for planning grocery shopping,53 and aligns with the premise of the TPB to understand behavioral intentions. However, no study in this systematic review tested the influence of meal planning on online grocery purchases of healthy items. In 1 study included in the present review, authors held community cooking classes as part of an intervention to improve access to fruits and vegetables.35 They reported an increase in fruit and vegetable consumption by children.35 In a recent study among a sample of majority non-Hispanic White women in Maine, researchers\nNutrition ReviewsVR Vol. 80(5):1294\u20131310 1307\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nutritionreview s/article/80/5/1294/6514637 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nreported that online purchases were associated with lower spending on sweet snacks and desserts compared with in-store purchases.54 A potential explanation for the findings suggested by the authors included meal planning and the shopping lists built in to online grocery services.55 Those authors also found that consumers spent more dollars per transaction online compared with in-store shopping.54 Given that affordability of food is 1 of the main barriers to healthy diets among low-income populations56 and that disparities in the cost of foods have been found between online and physical stores,19 studies should be conducted to examine the financial impact of online purchases compared with in-store grocery purchases on low-income consumers\u2019 spending. Most studies in which the influence of online grocery shopping on nutrition outcomes was evaluated relied on self-reported measures of purchase and diet. Therefore, the impact of online grocery shopping on supporting healthy eating practices should be further examined. Investigation of how the ability to use national food and nutrition assistance benefits online affects healthiness of food selection and dietary behaviors is another area that warrants more investigation."

            "heading": "Policy and research implications",
            "text": "Studies included in this review highlighted the importance of research to inform, develop, and evaluate policy and program efforts in the online grocery environment to promote the purchase and consumption of healthy foods among underserved populations. Findings from various studies underscored the need to make online grocery services more attractive to lowincome groups through improving consumers\u2019 perception of control over grocery selection24,36\u201338 and addressing financial barriers by offering deals comparable to those in-store.19,37\nEnvironmental and social barriers to SNAP participation exist, especially for low-income populations in areas with a high cost of living.40 In 6 studies, researchers explored perceptions and attitudes toward online grocery shopping among SNAP participants. Researchers identified barriers to online grocery services and suggested strategies to promote more equitable food access for low-income populations, including increased transparency and customer control,24 competitive prices, 1-day delivery, SNAP Electronic Benefits Transfer online payment acceptance,31 and use of handheld devices to allow for payment at delivery,12 some of which have already been included in the OPP expansion. Nonetheless, the low availability of grocery delivery service in the US Department of Agriculture\u2013 defined food deserts and rural areas is still a deterrent to equitable access to healthy foods.18,39 It is crucial to\nmaintain support for SNAP online post-pandemic and to expand online access to other food assistance programs, like WIC.39 Zimmer et al38 highlighted the potential benefits of online ordering to facilitate WIC food retail operations, and Jilcott Pitts et al36 noted that the ability to use WIC online could help with linkage to nutrition education programs, improving access and food literacy for disadvantaged groups.\nAll but 2 studies33 included in this systematic review collected data before the COVID-19 pandemic, which has affected the food system and families\u2019 purchasing and dietary habits.57\u201359 The pandemic also prompted the US Department of Agriculture OPP\u2019s rapid expansion to most US states and the inclusion of additional authorized retailers, thus increasing access to online grocery services among underserved populations.21 However, most studies included in this review were conducted prior to the roll out and expansion of the OPP when online grocery purchasing surged.60 Therefore, interest in and uptake of online grocery shopping among low-income diverse populations presented in this systematic review are likely underestimated. Because of the increase in online grocery shopping uptake, social norms, attitudes, and barriers may have shifted, thus necessitating evaluations to examine changes among underserved populations due to the pandemic."

            "heading": "Limitations",
            "text": "This systematic review has some limitations. First, although information on online grocery shopping may be available in gray literature reports, websites, or other unexamined documents, we focused exclusively on peer-reviewed literature. The exclusive use of peerreviewed literature helps ensure reasonable quality of the research reported. Second, the use of only peerreviewed literature may lead to publication bias because studies with negative or null outcomes are less likely to be published. Third, the tools used to assess quality of study varied by study design and may not be comparable with each other, although all the tools are widely used and were selected to enhance comparability with other reviews. Fourth, studies included in this review varied methodologically in terms of study design, sample size, and locale. Only 2 studies had randomized controlled design; most studies had small and convenient sample sizes. Thus, findings should be interpreted with caution and may not be generalizable. Yet, the inclusive search strategy of a wide array of disciplines using both quantitative and qualitative designs is a strength of this review. Fifth, all studies included in this systematic review were conducted in the United States, despite the extensive literature on online grocery shopping in\n1308 Nutrition ReviewsVR Vol. 80(5):1294\u20131310\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nutritionreview s/article/80/5/1294/6514637 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nEuropean countries. Given the focus of this study on low-income, diverse populations, the European-based studies did not meet the eligibility criteria for this review. More research examining online grocery shopping behaviors among underserved populations is needed outside of the United States. Last, given the variability in outcomes reported in the studies, it was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis to evaluate the pooled effect of online grocery shopping on health equity, healthy food purchasing, and diet among lowincome, diverse populations."

            "heading": "CONCLUSIONS",
            "text": "Barriers to equitable access to healthy foods in online grocery services included higher cost and scarcity of delivery services in rural and food desert areas. The expansion of online grocery services and other grocery delivery programs paired with nutrition assistance programs were enablers of equitable access to food through online grocery shopping. Most studies included in this review assessed psychosocial factors associated with online grocery shopping uptake, which acted as deterrents to online grocery shopping (ie, lack of control, concerns around food selection, perceived high cost, lack of social interaction) or facilitators (ie, perception of less stress, less impulse buying, convenience, time-saving). Studies included in this review reported mixed findings related to healthiness of foods purchased online; in the few studies in which dietary behaviors were assessed, authors reported increases in consumption of healthy foods associated with online grocery uptake. Future research should examine the effects of online grocery shopping on purchasing and diet using validated, empirical measures, including itemized grocery receipts and food frequency questionnaires or multiple 24-hour dietary recalls. In light of the OPP expansion and emerging studies on the feasibility of accepting WIC online, more research is needed to test interventions to improve equitable access to healthy food via online grocery services and assess its impact on food purchases and dietary behaviors of low-income families."
