    "abstractText": "Microbial natural products are specialized metabolites that are sources of many bioactive compounds including antibiotics, antifungals, antiparasitics, anticancer agents, and probes of biology. The assembly of libraries of producers of natural products has traditionally been the province of the pharmaceutical industry. This sector has gathered significant historical collections of bacteria and fungi to identify new drug leads with outstanding outcomes\u2014upwards of 60% of drug scaffolds originate from such libraries. Despite this success, the repeated rediscovery of known compounds and the resultant diminishing chemical novelty contributed to a pivot from this source of bioactive compounds toward more tractable synthetic compounds in the drug industry. The advent of advanced mass spectrometry tools, along with rapid whole genome sequencing and in silico identification of biosynthetic gene clusters that encode the machinery necessary for the synthesis of specialized metabolites, offers the opportunity to revisit microbial natural product libraries with renewed vigor. Assembling a suitable library of microbes and extracts for screening requires the investment of resources and the development of methods that have customarily been the proprietary purview of large pharmaceutical companies. Here, we report a perspective on our efforts to assemble a library of natural product-producing microbes and the establishment of methods to extract and fractionate bioactive compounds using resources available to most academic labs. We validate the library and approach through a series of screens for antimicrobial and cytotoxic agents. This work serves as a blueprint for establishing libraries of microbial natural product producers and bioactive extract fractions suitable for screens of bioactive compounds. One-Sentence Summary: Natural products are key to discovery of novel antimicrobial agents: Here, we describe our experience and lessons learned in constructing a microbial natural product and pre-fractionated extract library.",

The discovery f antibiotics such as gramicidin and streptomycin from soil baceria in the early 1940s ushered in an era of systematic collectng of environmental microbes followed by screens of extracts for ioactivity by the pharmaceutical and crop protection industries, strategy termed the Waksman Platform (Lewis, 2013 ). The Waksman platform was groundbreaking for drug discovry. This strategy identified most of the antibiotic scaffolds in urrent use, many antifungal and antiparasitic agents, anticancer ompounds, cholesterol-lowering agents, immunosuppressants, nd more (Lewis, 2020 ). Microbes were also productive sources f herbicides (e.g. bialaphos) and insecticides (e.g. spinosyns) Demain & Sanchez, 2009 ). As a result of these successes, most arge pharmaceutical and crop protection companies accumuated in-house libraries of thousands of environmental bacteria nd fungi. For decades, organic and aqueous extracts of these solates were employed in activity-based screens, resulting in any high-value products. Despite this success, microbial natural products have drawacks (Butler, 2004 ; Atanasov et al., 2021 ). These compounds are enerated in complex mixtures of metabolites and must be puried by bespoke methods, the quantity of active compound is often ow, requiring significant strain optimization to improve yield, and imilar chemical scaffolds are frequently re-isolated (the derepliation problem). By the end of the 20th century, due to these chalenges along with the advent of competing sources of compounds uch as combinatorial platforms to generate large libraries of olecules, interest in natural products began to wane. In parallel with the pivot away from microbial natural products y industry, several innovations began to fuel renewed interest in his source of bioactive chemical matter. Genome sequencing of atural product-producing bacteria revealed that most bacteria nd fungi have dozens of genetic programs for producing natural roducts and that many are underexpressed under lab conditions, eaning that there is significant untapped bioactive potential in ibraries of microbes (Pepler et al., 2022 ). Furthermore, emerging ools such as Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic epeats (CRISPR)-mediated inactivation of the biosynthesis of ommonly expressed compounds offers new strategies to re-mine icrobes for rare metabolites (Culp et al., 2019 ). The developent of rapid mass spectrometry tools and community-based latforms for data analysis, such as Global Natural Products Soial (GNPS) molecular networking (Nothias et al., 2020 ), as well s cell-based arrays of antibiotic resistance elements (Cox et al., 017 ), are helping to address the dereplication problem. Synthetic iology methods offer modern approaches to tackle strain imrovement and minimization of unwanted side products (Xu et l., 2020 ; Alam et al., 2021 ). These advances provide confidence hat a renaissance in microbial natural product drug discovery is nderway. While these advances offer new routes to explore natural roducts, the large collections assembled by industry over ecades often remain proprietary and inaccessible to academic abs. A recent welcome exception is the donation of Pfizer\u2019s hisoric collection to the Natural Product Library Initiative at the cripps Research Institute (Steele et al., 2019 ). Over 20 years ago, ur team began assembling the Wright Actinomycete Collecion (WAC), initially focusing on isolating highly gifted natural roduct-producing actinomycetes from soil. The collection has rown to include \u223c12 000 isolates of actinomycetes and other acteria and filamentous fungi isolated from diverse environ-\nents, resulting in the isolation and characterization of several ew bioactive compounds. Here, we report our strategy and inights gained from establishing a collection of natural product roducers in an academic setting and the application of a costffective method of partial fractionation of extracts to improve he output of high-throughput screens.\naterials and Methods solation of Environmental Bacteria and Fungi he original isolates in the WAC were prepared following the rotocols detailed by D\u2019Costa et al . (D\u2019Costa et al., 2006 ). Our ethodology has evolved with experience, and various media nd antibiotic selection conditions are employed to isolate addiional diverse bacterial and fungal phyla. A consensus method s presented below. Further details on a range of pre-treatment onditions, isolation media, and specialized procedures for isoating fungal endophytes or insect microbiota isolates are decribed in Supplementary Tables S1 \u2013S3 and the frequency of aplication of each pre-treatment or isolation media is indicated in upplementary Fig. S1A and S1B . Soil samples were dried in sterile petri dishes at room temperture for 5\u20137 days. For each sample, 1 g of soil was resuspended n 10 mL of sterile distilled deionized water (ddH2 O) and mixed by ortexing. Three 10-fold serial dilutions with sterile ddH2 O were repared, and 100 \u03bcL of each suspension was plated on isolation edia. For a large proportion of the collection ( Supplementary ig. S1B ), strains were isolated on Streptomyces Isolation Media SIM) consisting of 0.2 g casein, 0.5 g starch, 0.25 g KNO3 , 0.1 g\n2 HPO4 , 0.05 g MgSO4 , 0.05 g CaCO3 , 7.5 g agar in 500 mL ddH2 O, upplemented with cycloheximide (20 \u03bcg/mL) to inhibit fungal rowth. Plates were incubated at room temperature without light o mimic environmental conditions. Putative actinomycetes were dentified as sporulating colonies, commonly producing a distincive soil-like odor, and purified to apparent homogeneity by seial passage on SIM. Strains were subsequently analyzed by Gram tain and Gram-positive, filamentous isolates, with a synchronous egmentation pattern characteristic of actinomycetes (Kieser et l., 2000 ) were preserved. Spore stocks were prepared in duplicate, using a modified proocol (Kieser et al., 2000 ). Briefly, a single colony was inoculated nto a 5 mL culture of Soygrit Vegetative Media (SVM, 7.5 g gluose, 10 g potato starch, 7.5 g soybean grits, 5 g yeast extract, 1 g aCO3 , 5 g corn steep liquor, pH 6.5, in 500 mL ddH2 O) (Marshall & right, 1996 ) containing a metal spring to promote aeration, and ncubated at 30\u00b0C for 2\u20134 days. A confluent lawn was prepared on ennett\u2019s Agar (5 g potato starch, 1 g casamino acids [Biobasic], .9 g yeast extract [Thermo Fisher Scientific], 7.5 g agar in 500 mL dH2 O, pH to 6.8; add 1 mL Czapek Mineral Mix [10 g KCl, 10 g gSO4 \u20227H2 O, 12 g NaNO3 , 0.2 g FeSO4, 200 \u03bcL concentrated HCl n 100 mL] after autoclaving) using 700 \u03bcL of each culture. Plates ere incubated at 30\u00b0C until dense sporulation was evident (aproximately 7\u201310 days). A layer of spores was removed from the gar surface, resuspended in 9 mL of sterile ddH2 O by vortexing, nd gravity filtered through sterile filters of cotton wool (Kieser t al., 2000 ). The filtrate was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 min, nd the subsequent pellet was resuspended in 1 mL of sterile 20% lycerol for storage at \u221280\u00b0C. Fungal isolates were cultured in potato dextrose (PD) media Bioshop). Non-spore-forming microorganisms were cultured in iquid Bennett\u2019s media. Strains were stored as 20% glycerol stocks t \u221280\u00b0C.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jim b/article/50/1/kuad042/7459345 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nIsolate Characterization Oligonucleotide primers are described in Supplementary Table S4 . Microbial DNA samples for Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) were prepared from a single colony with PrepMan Ultra (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. BOX-PCR was performed as described using primer BOXA1R (Lanoot et al., 2004 ). 16S PCR was performed with primers 16_BAC_F and 16_BAC_R as described (Heuer et al., 1997 ). 18S PCR was performed as described with primers 18S_For and 18S_Rev (Borneman & Hartin, 2000 ). Sanger sequencing was performed at McMaster Genomics Facility.\nFungal microscopy was performed on an Evos XL Core microscope with a 100X objective lens on cells stained with lactophenol cotton blue stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific).\nGenome Analyses The WAC phylogenetic tree was generated using the Genome Taxonomy Database Toolkit (GTDB-Tk v2.2.6 de_novo_wf, (Chaumeil et al., 2022 )) with all unique sequenced WAC genomes as input alongside the GTDB p__Actinobacteria reference genomes and GCF_003569045 ( Aggregatilinea lenta ) as an outgroup. The tree was visualized using the Interactive Tree of Life (iTOL v6.7.6, (Letunic & Bork, 2021 )), and clades were roughly colored according to taxonomic orders with > 100 leaves. Biosynthetic gene clusters were identified and visualized using antiSMASH version 7 (Blin et al., 2023 ).\nCulture of Isolates and Generation of the Natural Product Library (NPL) WAC isolates were applied to Bennett\u2019s agar using an autoclaved sterile wooden applicator and incubated for 6 days at 30\u00b0C to assess for culture purity. Strains were inoculated in 3 mL of Streptomyces Antibiotic Activity Media (SAM) (15 g glucose, 15 g Phytone [soya peptone;Thermo Fisher Scientific], 5 g NaCl, 1 g yeast extract [Thermo Fisher Scientific], 1 g CaCO3 , 2.5 mL glycerol, ddH2 O to 1 L, pH to 6.8) containing a single 3 mm glass bead and incubated for 6 days at 30\u00b0C, shaking at 250 rpm.\nSAM cultures were inoculated to fresh Bennett\u2019s agar in duplicate and incubated at 30\u00b0C for 6 days to generate a lawn of growth. These cultures were then pressed through an empty 50 mL syringe using a mechanical \u201ccan crusher\u201d (MasterCrush, Carver\u2019s Olde Iron) and extracted with 10 mL methanol overnight, shaking at 250 rpm. The methanol extract was then passed through a milk filter (KenAG, model number D110) to remove solids and collected in 16 \u00d7 100 mm disposable borosilicate glass tubes. The extracts were evaporated overnight in a Genevac centrifugal evaporator (SP Scientific) and resuspended in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO). The crude extracts were combined and transferred to 2 mL centrifuge tubes. For fungal cultures, the same protocol was employed, but cells were cultured in potato dextrose media (Bioshop, with 20 g agar added for solid media).\nAliquots of the DMSO extracts were arrayed in 96-well daughter microtiter plates and stored at \u221230\u00b0C.\nPrefractionation Library (PFL) NPL extracts were subjected to reverse-phased C18 chromatography using a medium-pressure Teledyne NextGen CombiFlash system to generate a library of partially purified fractions. The crude extract was applied to a sample load cartridge (#693873235, Teledyne) containing 1 g of packed C18 resin and separated on a 15.5 g HP C18 Gold column (RediSep Rf Gold C18 High-Performance Columns #692203334, Teledyne) equilibrated with 90% solution A (ddH2 O and 0.1% formic acid): 10% solution B (acetonitrile\n+ 0.1% formic acid). A volume of 13.5 mL ( \u223c1 column volume, CV) fractions were collected across a linear gradient of solution B from 10% to 100% (Program: 3 CV, 10% B; 11 CV, 10\u2013100% B; 5 CV, 100% \u221210% B; 2 CV, 10% B). Chromatography was performed at room temperature at a nominal flow rate of 30 mL/min, adapting for pressure. After chromatographic separation, the first 22 fractions were evaporated overnight by centrifugal evaporation (Genevac) with standard low-temperature (27\u00b0C) High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) fraction protocols.\nCombiflash fractions were dissolved in DMSO to a total of 750 \u03bcL, combined as follows: Fraction 1 (3 CV, \u223c40 mL); Fractions 2\u20137 (2 CV, \u223c27 mL); Fraction 8 (7 CV, \u223c95 mL).The fractions were added along with the crude extract and conditioned media (CM) to 96-well Costar polystyrene daughter microtiter plates and stored at \u221230\u00b0C.\nGeneration of Conditioned Media Samples Liquid Bennett\u2019s media (5 mL in a 50 mL centrifuge tube) was inoculated with a single colony. Three sterile 3 mm glass beads were added to prevent clumping. Cultures were shaken at 250 rpm and 30\u00b0C for 6 days with loose caps. After incubation, the conditioned medium was filtered through 0.22 \u03bcm polyethersulfone filters (Millex-GP) and added to the PFL plates.\nCell-based High-Throughput Screens of Bacterial and Fungal Strains High-throughput (HT) screens were performed using the PFL against the ESKAPE pathogens\u2014Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC 13048, Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213, Klebsiella pneumoniae ATCC 33495, Acinetobacter baumannii ATCC 17978, Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, Enterococcus faecium ATCC 19434; as well as Escherichia coli ATCC 25922; E. coli BW25113 bamB tolC ; E. coli BW25113 bamB tolC pLacI-NDM-1; and the pathogenic yeast species Candida albicans ATCC 90028 and Candida auris CBS 10913.\nBacteria and yeast were assayed in cation-adjusted Mueller\u2013 Hinton Broth media (caMHB, Fisher Scientific) and RPMI-1640 media (R6504, Sigma\u2013Aldrich), respectively. Before screening, bacterial and yeast cultures were grown 24 h at 37\u00b0C on caMHB and 48 h at 30\u00b0C on YPD, respectively. From these cultures, a final concentration of 0.0005 OD625 of bacteria or 0.000055 OD530 of yeast was obtained and used in screening.\nHT screens were performed in 384-well microtiter plates (Corning 3701) with 49 \u03bcL of inoculated media and 1 \u03bcL of crude extracts/CM/fractions. Fractions, extracts, and inoculated media were dispensed to plates with a Biomek FXP Integrated Liquid Handler. Plates were incubated for 24 h at 37\u00b0C and 48 h at 30\u00b0C for bacteria and yeast, respectively. Cell growth was quantified at OD600 on an EnVision (Molecular Devices), SpectraMax (Molecular Devices), or Biotek Neo microtiter plate reader.

Cell Titer Glo (25 \u03bcL) was added directly o the media, the plates were shaken for 2 min and then incubated or 10 min at room temperature. The luminescence was read on a eo2 plate reader (Biotek) using luminescence fiber (20 ms interation time).

Cholesterol was added to a final conentration of 5 mg/L following sterilization of the medium.

Procedures for the isolation of microorgansms have varied and evolved to enrich for different bacterial or ungal genera. Our consensus methods for isolating organisms rom soil, plant, or insect samples are presented in Fig. 1 a. We mployed pre-treatment conditions to select heat and chemicalesistant spores from actinomycetes and added pre-treatments nd modulated media isolation conditions to expand diversity in acterial and fungal species, endophytes, or insect microbiomes Supplementary Tables S1 \u2013S3 ; Supplementary Fig. S1A and S1B ). A significant issue in building a collection of environmental mirobes is avoiding strain duplication. While difficult to avoid enirely, particularly when isolating strains in independent batches, e have had reasonable success within batches with BOX-PCR Supplementary Fig. S1C (Lanoot et al., 2004 )). BOX-PCR employs rimer binding at multiple common loci in bacterial genomes to enerate a characteristic banding pattern. Strains with identical anding patterns and common colony morphology are likely the ame species, and only one isolate is retained. In the case of funal strains, a combination of colony morphology and microscopy Supplementary Fig. S1D ) is helpful to de-duplicate strains. For a portion of the WAC isolates ( \u223c12 %), we have sequenced he variable region of 16S (bacteria) or internally transcribed reion of 18S rRNA (fungi). These data estimate the WAC library\u2019s omposition (Fig. 1 b). As expected, given the emphasis on sporeorming actinomycetes, these organisms dominate the collection, articularly from the order Streptomycetales. However, the collecion also includes many Firmicutes; \u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3 , and \u03b4-proteobacteria, nd filamentous fungi. Additionally, we have genome sequences or a subset of the WAC library ( \u223c4%), chosen primarily for their ntimicrobial activity (Fig. 1 c). When included within a phylogeetic tree of phylum Actinobacteriota, we can see broad coverge of the order Streptomycetales, and lesser coverage of Nocardia , mycolatopsis , Nonomuraea , Spirillospora , Nocardioides , and Kribbella enera. There are also areas of the tree with minimal coverage, epresenting avenues for future targeted collecting and exploation.\neneration of the Natural Product Extract Library NPL) he WAC is an excellent source of bioactive compounds and has een employed by our team for a range of applications, includng the identification of new anticancer stem cell agents and animalarials (Benoit et al., 2021 ; Alder et al., 2022 ); co-culture idenification of novel antifungal agents (Robbins et al., 2016 ); genome ining-based natural product discovery (Culp et al., 2020 , 2022 ; u et al., 2020 , 2022 ; Yarlagadda, Medina, Johnson, et al., 2020 ); nd the exploration of environmental antimicrobial resistance D\u2019Costa et al., 2006 ). However, the principal use of the WAC has een in screens for novel antimicrobial agents and antibiotic aduvants.\nFig. 1. Construction and composition of the Wright Actinomycetes Collection (WAC). (a) Workflow for the isolation of bacterial and fungal strains from (i) soil and (ii) plant or insect samples. (i) Soil samples were collected from diverse environments across Canada and other countries not represented here. A range of pre-treatment conditions and culture conditions were employed to enrich for particular bacterial genera. (ii) Plant and insect samples were collected, surface sterilized, and prepared for isolation of fungal endophytes and bacteria from the insect microbiome, respectively. Pre-treatment conditions for soil, plant, and insect samples are described in more detail in the Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 . Media conditions employed in isolation of microorganisms are described in Supplementary Table S3 .

Strains were predominantly chosen for sequencing as biased by antimicrobial activity across greater than a decade of whole cell extract screening.

Regions of the tree enriched for WAC strains are indicated.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jim b/article/50/1/kuad042/7459345 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nWe developed a practical, cost-effective pipeline to generate microbial extracts (Fig. 2 a) using low-cost materials to enable chemical screening. Understanding that growth media conditions can significantly impact the expression of specialized metabolites, we performed an extensive survey of conditions that in our hands offer broad culturability of soil bacteria, good compound production for many isolates, and a low background of UV-active material in LC-MS ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ). One option is to prepare an extract library from isolates grown under many different conditions (Pan et al., 2019 ). For fungal strains and streptomycetes, solid media fermentation is often more successful (VanderMolen et al., 2013 ; Lajtai-Szab\u00f3 et al., 2022 ). We found extensive media screening impractical for an academic lab and settled on the protocol described here as a compromise that works well in our hands. Microbes are grown on agar plates, and the cells and agar, impregnated with natural products, are extruded through 60 cc\nsyringes (which can be washed and reused) to increase surface area and subsequently extracted with methanol. We have adapted a large can crusher (MasterCrush, https://www.carversoldeiron. com/) mounted on a simple wooden frame to facilitate agar extrusion. Methanol extraction is performed at room temperature with shaking over 16\u201324 h, and the solid material is removed by use of a milk filter. We explored alternative extraction solvents (butanol, acetone) in the context of known antibiotic producers and found that the solvents tested were similarly effective. Given that methanol lacks a reactive ketone as found in acetone; has a lower boiling point than butanol and is sufficiently volatile to minimize evaporation time; and is inexpensive, we chose to use methanol in our workflow. After drying in a centrifugal evaporator, the solid material is very dense and it dissolves slowly in DMSO over 2\u20133 days with periodic vortexing. While the long duration represents an opportunity for unstable compounds to degrade, such as the\nFig. 2. Generation of a natural product extract library (NPL) and prefractionation extract library (PFL) from the WAC and pilot screening against a panel of bacterial and fungal pathogens. (a) Workflow for generation of natural product extracts from bacterial and fungal strains. Depending on the application, either one (NPL) or two (PFL) plates are inoculated for extract preparation. To increase surface area for natural product extraction with methanol, agar cultures are extruded through syringes with the aid of a large can crusher. After extraction, half of a milk filter (to minimize absorption of solvent to the filter) is used to remove solid material from methanol extracts. The half filter is folded as indicated. When generating samples for the PFL, half of the final DMSO dissolved extracts are reserved as a \u201ccrude\u201d sample, equivalent to samples prepared for the NPL, while the other half are fractionated. (b) Fractionation procedure for the PFL. Samples are separated by C18 flash chromatography and pooled to yield a total of eight fractions. Fractions are modestly concentrated twofold relative to crude extracts. (c) Workflow for pilot screening of the PFL versus the ESKAPE pathogens, pathogenic Candida , a hyperpermeable and efflux defective E. coli , and HEK293 cells. Edge effects were normalized by row\u2013column normalization for fungal and bacterial screens, while a modified approach was employed for HEK cell screening ( Supplementary Fig. S2 ) (d) Replica plot of a PFL screen versus S. aureus . The line graphs below and to the left of the scatterplot indicate whether the fitness effect observed in the scatterplot was associated with crude samples, hydrophilic (fr.1\u20134), or hydrophobic (fr.5\u20138) fractions.

Cleared extracts are aliquoted and form he basis of the NPL collection, which presently numbers \u223c10 000 xtracts. This collection has been a driving force of new chemial matter discovery in the laboratory (Cox et al., 2014 ; King et al., 014 ; Perry et al., 2015 ; Gehrke et al., 2017 ; Yarlagadda, Medina, & right, 2020 ; Alder et al., 2022 ).\ni eneration and Screening of a Pre-Fractionated xtract Library (PFL) ne of the drawbacks of the NPL is that it is often very visous, which limits its use with modern acoustic-based dispensers sed in HT screening labs. With this limitation in mind and given eports in the literature of greater hit rates observed by preractionating whole cell extracts (Appleton et al., 2007 ; Wagenaar, 008 ; Thornburg et al., 2018 ), we generated a pilot PFL from 381 solates and 3 media-only controls.\nb/article/50/1/kuad042/7459345 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\na ( o p f w a p t c r t s a C s C s s ( t\n3 p m e e y (\nr a d t u w\nW i a o a t p\nd t d t m m d t n i t c\nt i F t\ni o w a p t a f c t W s f m\na a\nP D T r i p i a o b s\nv F c a 3 m t y s t p r f\na v t ( t o 6 W C p\no o 2 E G o t\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jim b/article/50/1/kuad042/7459345 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nOther published methods use resource intensive HPLC sepration or solid phase extraction and collect many fractions Appleton et al., 2007 ; Wagenaar, 2008 ; Thornburg et al., 2018 ). To ptimize the process for an academic setting, we used medium ressure flash reverse phase chromatography and collected eight ractions across an acetonitrile gradient. NPL extracts (Fig. 2 a), ere separated by C18 flash chromatography using a water: cetonitrile gradient and formic acid ion pair in both mobile hases collecting eight fractions (Fig. 2 a and b). Fraction 1 spans he elution range of DMSO, which contains the most hydrophilic ompounds and those which co-elute with DMSO. Fraction 8 epresents the most hydrophobic fractions, up to 100% of the aceonitrile mobile phase. The total number of fractions was chosen trategically to maintain a total of 10 samples per WAC strain in 96-well screening plate (crude extract, CM, and eight fractions). onditioned media was generated separately by growth of WAC trains in liquid culture with sterile filtration of the media. olumns 1 and 12 are left empty in our screening plates, allowing pace in high-throughput assays for high\u2013low controls. Initial creening plates included CM; however, due to a low\u2013hit rate Supplementary Fig. S4B ), we discontinued CM preparation and hese samples are omitted from subsequent analyses. In a pilot assessment of the PFL, we screened fractions from 81 WAC isolates versus a panel of pathogens and other reorter organisms ( E. aerogenes , S. aureus , K. pneumoniae , A. bauannii , P. aeruginosa , E. faecium ; a clinical isolate of E. coli ; two fflux-defective hyperpermeable E. coli tolC bamB , one of which xpresses the metallo- \u03b2-lactamase NDM1; and two pathogenic east species, C. albicans, and C. auris ) for antimicrobial activity Fig. 2 c). An example replicate data set is shown in Fig. 2 d for S. aueus . Notably, growth inhibition activity is not equally distributed cross fractions but is enriched in the more hydrophobic ones, inicating either similar bioactive compounds or a bias toward cerain chemical properties in S. aureus antimicrobial natural prodcts. This enrichment is most evident in S.aureus , but is observed ith other organisms as well ( Supplementary Fig. S4A ). Consistent with published studies (Appleton et al., 2007 ; agenaar, 2008 ; Thornburg et al., 2018 ), we observed an increase n the number of hits from fractions relative to crude extracts lone. However, this increase was modest (up to \u223c two fold) and rganism-dependent (Fig. 2 e; Supplementary Fig. S4C ). Many hits ppear in multiple fractions from a single WAC strain, consisent with either multiple bioactive compounds or individual comounds spanning multiple fractions (Fig. 2 f). When we examined the entire dataset, consisting of 12 screens esigned to capture antimicrobial, antifungal, and cytotoxic acivities (Fig. 3 a), we observed that bioactive hits were not equally istributed among the eight fractions. The most hydrophilic (fracion 1) and the most hydrophobic (fraction 8) fractions contain the ost bioactivity ( Supplementary Fig. S4B ). Fraction 8 included the ost toxic activity against HEK293 cells (Fig. 3 b and c), albeit reuced compared to crude extract alone. Further, the active fracion distribution varies by target organism (Fig. 3 c), with Gramegative pathogens proportionally more affected by compounds n fraction 1, Gram-positive pathogens in fractions 6\u20137 (similar o efflux defective, hyperpermeable E. coli ), and yeasts affected by ompounds in fractions 5\u20136. In some cases, the spectrum of activity observed in crude exracts is mirrored by that observed in a single fraction, suggestng a single or related class of molecules (WAC11070, WAC11024, ig. 3 d (i)). In other cases, the spectrum of activity in crude exracts represents multiple compounds, with the pattern of activ-\nty split between fractions (WAC01560, WAC08452, Fig. 3 d (ii)). This bservation is notable with \u201ctoxic\u201d crude extracts that may otherise have been lost when triaging screen data; in some cases, the ntimicrobial compounds can be separated from the toxic comound (WAC09344, WAC01542, Fig. 3 d (iii)). This \u201cuncoupling\u201d from oxicity is distinct from the general trend where crude extracts re more toxic than fractions, as this may simply be due to difering potency and compound dilution across fractions. In other ases, we note the appearance of activity in one or more fractions hat were completely absent from crude material (WAC10982, AC10983, WAC11081, WAC11085, Fig. 3 d (iv)). Surprisingly, in ome cases, this new-found activity is observed across multiple ractions, despite only a twofold enrichment relative to the crude aterial (WAC10982, WAC10983, Fig. 3 d (iv)). While the PFL is a relatively new resource in the laboratory, we\nlready have evidence of success (Yarlagadda et al., 2021 ), with dditional examples in the late stages of preparation.\nrefractionation of Extracts Facilitates the ereplication of Known Natural Products he biggest obstacle to natural product discovery is the issue of ediscovery. Like others in the field of NP discovery, our pipeline nvolves a step to dereplicate or more accurately to \u201cderisk\u201da given urification. Conclusive demonstration that a known compound s both present and responsible for observed bioactivity is timend resource-limiting, and so we focus on rapid evaluation of risk f rediscovery. We have found the prefractionation of extracts to e particularly useful in the derisking process and here provide ome examples of its application. In some cases, visual inspection of a plate of extracts can proide clues as to common bioactive natural products (Fig. 4 a). or example, extracts of fungal strains WAC11201 and WAC11218 ontain a striking yellow color in fraction 8. Both extracts show similar spectrum of activity. The strong UV signature in the 60\u2013400 nm range is associated with mass signatures and fragentation patterns ( Supplementary Fig. S5A ) consistent with anhraquinones, a common group of toxic molecules produced by easts (Masi & Evidente, 2020 ). Such evidence, while not concluively establishing the compound identity, establish sufficient risk hat we do not proceed with further purification with these samles. Similarly, bacterial extracts with intense yellow colors eniched in fraction 8 commonly contain actinomycins, as observed or WAC08267 (Fig. 4 a; Supplementary Fig. S5B ). The spectrum of bioactivity observed in common fractions can lso provide clues to aid in dereplication. WAC01490 was preiously observed in the laboratory to produce tunicamycin, afer discovery in a screen for anti-helminthics versus C. elegans Fig. 4 b). The WAC01490 genome contains the expected biosynhetic gene cluster (Blin et al., 2023 ) and tunicamycin can be bserved by LC-MS (Fig. 4 b, Supplementary Fig. S5C ). Fraction of WAC01490 has a similar spectrum of bioactivity to that in AC01325 (Fig. 4 b), suggesting it might also produce tunicamycin. onsistent with this hypothesis, WAC01325 has a similar LC-MS rofile, and multiple tunicamycins can be observed in fraction 6. In some cases, the fraction within which a given activity is bserved can provide clues as to its identity. We have previusly employed the Antibiotic Resistance Platform (Cox et al., 017 ), an arrayed collection of resistance genes in an isogenic . coli background, to identify the active components in many ram-negative NPL hits. The most common natural products bserved were albomycin, streptothricin, and streptomycin. All hree compounds are hydrophilic and elute in fraction 1 of the PFL.\nFig. 4. Prefractionation aids in the process of dereplication. (a) The pattern of color in a PFL plate can be suggestive of the presence of common natural products. (i) PFL plates with yellow material in fraction 8 from fungal (top) and bacterial (bottom) extracts often contain compounds consistent with anthraquinones and actinomycins, respectively. Conditioned media (CM) was initially included in PFL plates but ultimately discontinued due to low hit rate. Red circle, fractions of interest. Cr, crude. (ii) The fungal strains with similar patterns of color share a similar spectrum of activity. Color scale is the same as in Fig. 3 . (iii) High resolution ESI-QTOF-MS data from fraction 8 of active fungal WAC strains. UV absorbance from 360\u2013400 nm and a corresponding compound with a mass of 286.05 Da is suggestive of a tetrahydroxymethylanthraquinone. The UV detector and MS spectra are separated by a time interval of \u223c 0.1 min. (iv) Crude extracts and fraction 8 of WAC08267 contain actinomycins and intermediates.

When we examine bioacivities of PFL fraction 1 samples versus K. pneumoniae and E. erogenes (Fig. 4 c), there are three outliers with potent bioactivty. Predictably, WAC01512, and WAC08452 contain the BGCs for lbomycin and streptothricin, respectively. Correspondingly, ions onsistent with albomycin \u03b42 and streptothricin F by exact mass nd fragmentation pattern are observed in these fractions (Fig. 4 c; upplementary Fig. S5D and S5E ). In contrast, WAC11213 is a funal strain that does not make these common Gram-negative acive compounds and is a candidate for further study (currently ngoing). Fractionation offers the opportunity to purify and identify comounds that show weak or otherwise obscured activity in crude xtracts. In WAC01560 and WAC06771, an anti- S. aureus activty was observed most strongly in fraction 6 or 7, respectively, ith weak or absent activity in crude extracts (Fig. 4 d). WAC01560 ontains the BGC for viridogrisein, half of a described synergisic antibiotic pair (Asano & Adachi, 2006 ; Xie et al., 2012 ), while AC06771 contains a BGC for a rifamycin, a well-established lass of antibiotics. In both cases, ions corresponding with these ompounds by exact mass and fragmentation were observed Supplementary Fig. S6 ).\niscussion e describe here our experience building a collection of soil mirobes and associated libraries of natural product extracts and pre-fractionated library using simple, cost-effective, and easy o teach methodologies. The WAC and NPL have proved invaluble resources to the laboratory over the years, seeding multile research projects (D\u2019Costa et al., 2006 ; Perry et al., 2015 ; Robins et al., 2016 ; Culp et al., 2020 , 2022 ; Xu et al., 2020 , 2022 ; arlagadda, Medina, Johnson, et al., 2020 ; Alder et al., 2022 ). In ddition to their utility in discovery, these approaches have proided a valuable training opportunity for high school, undergradate, and graduate students. Emphasizing the accessibility, other roups have employed similar public-based strategies to build p soil microbe collections. For example, the Tiny Earth initiaive engages undergraduate students across multiple academic nstitutions in local soil microbe isolation, identification, and animicrobial activity screening, all coupled to a central database https://tinyearth.wisc.edu/) (Hurley et al., 2021 )). Our approach uses materials and techniques that are relatively nexpensive and accessible in most academic settings, democraizing the establishment of natural product libraries, which once ere primarily the purview of the private sector. Compound rediscovery is among the most challenging and ostly disadvantages in a natural product discovery pipeline. In ur experience, approximately 1 in 10 hits represent something ew, while others represent rediscovered compounds. Numerous trategies have been employed to mitigate this issue\u2014to establish he risk of rediscovery, with MS or MS2-based approaches, couled with publically seeded compound databases (such as the Dicionary of Natural Products, https://dnp.chemnetbase.com/); and esistance-based platforms most used in our laboratory (Cox et l., 2017 ; Nothias et al., 2020 ). Where genome sequence is availble, antiSMASH (Blin et al., 2023 ) has proved invaluable in estabishing a short-list of antimicrobial candidates, though it is rarely ost- or time-effective to sequence a genome without prior deisking. Regardless, the dereplication problem remains a bottleeck and our approaches continue to evolve with the literature. or example, while we commonly correlate metabolomics data\nnd bioactivity to narrow down candidate bioactive molecules on case-by-case basis either manually or using software like Mass rofiler Professional (Agilent), resources like NP analyst represent ore powerful and exciting additions to the community to interate LC-MS and bioactivity data at scale (Lee et al., 2022 ). In building a collection of natural product-producing microbes, educing strain duplication is critical to lessen the frequency of ompound rediscovery. We have had success with BOX-PCR and solating organisms from diverse environmental samples to avoid he isolation of clones within samples. Prefractionation coupled ith screening of sentinel organisms represents another tool to itigate rediscovery, tying a spectrum of activity to additional hemical information on the hydrophobicity of a compound. As hown in the tunicamycin example, overlapping activity spectra bserved between two or more strains/extracts may offer clues to he identity of an active compound and help dereplicate a collecion. The PFL has proved highly valuable despite the investment reuired. Aligning with the \u201cOne strain many compounds\u201d concept Bode et al., 2002 ), this work emphasizes the complexity of natral product extracts. Activity in a crude extract may represent ultiple compounds. This complexity is of particular relevance hen considering data from toxicity counterscreens. In our hands, uch of the mammalian cell toxicity in natural product extracts s found in the most hydrophobic fractions. In contrast, many animicrobial activities are more hydrophilic, suggesting toxicity in rude extracts is not always a red flag. Similarly, in the absence of ractionation information, one may assume the activity in a crude xtract is linked to a single compound, while the reality may be hat multiple compounds, each with a different spectrum of acivity, may be present. Curiously, we observed some cases where he sum of activity in fractions appears much greater than that in rude extract. Whether this represents an antagonistic relationhip between material in the more complex crude extracts, such s might be expected for an antimetabolite, or something more rivial remains to be seen. Like many tools, dereplication with a pre-fractionated library s only as valuable as the source material. Rediscovery is still a roblem but with a greater understanding of what compounds are ommonly found where and what spectrum of activity they dislay across test organisms, its utility is increased. This observation s particularly true for fungal extracts, where historical knowledge s lacking, and represents a growing frontier for our laboratory and he community as a whole. Our experience shows that establishing a collection of natual product-producing microbes and their extracts can identify ovel chemical matter with a wide range of bioactivities. There is remendous untapped potential available in microbial genomes hat will enrich discoveries for decades to come. Establishing liraries of organisms that are difficult to culture, evolve in diverse nvironments, or that are found in the microbiomes of plants nd animals, offer promising new areas of focus for collection. etworking these initiatives across the globe would provide a remendous opportunity to explore biodiversity and identify the edicines of the future.\ncknowledgments he work represented here is the result of many years of effort by any students, friends and family of the lab, and collaborators. e wish to thank them for their efforts in creating the culture ollection and the associated extract libraries.\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /jim b/article/50/1/kuad042/7459345 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 12 January 2024\nSupplementary Material Supplementary material is available online at JIMB ( www.academic. oup.com/jimb ).\nFunding This work was supported over the years through grants to G.D.W. from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research, the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, the Ontario Research Fund, and the Canadian Institutes for Advanced Research.\nConflict of Interest The authors have no conflict of interest to declare.\nReferences Alam, K., Hao, J., Zhang, Y., & Li, A.
