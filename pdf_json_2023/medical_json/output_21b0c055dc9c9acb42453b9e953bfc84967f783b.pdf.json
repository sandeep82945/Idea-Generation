ELISA was used to reveal the presence of known circulating autoantibodies, while western blot (WB) was applied to characterize potential unknown autoantigen(s).\nResults: We enrolled 209 subjects, including patients affected by SLE (n=69), NPSLE (n=36), Multiple Sclerosis (MS, n=22), and 82 age- and gender-matched healthy donors (HD). Autoantibody reactivity by IF was observed in almost the entire rat brain (cortex, hippocampus, and cerebellum) using sera from NPSLE and SLE patients and was virtually negative in MS and HD. NPSLE showed higher prevalence (OR 2.4; p = 0.047), intensity, and titer of brain-reactive autoantibodies than SLE patients. Most of the patient sera with brain-reactive autoantibodies (75%) also stained human brains. Double staining experiments on rat brains mixing patients\u2019 sera with antibodies directed against neuronal (NeuN) or glial markers showed autoantibody reactivity restricted to NeuN-containing neurons. Using TEM, the targets of brain-reactive autoantibodies were located in the nuclei and, to a lesser extent, in the cytoplasm and mitochondria. Given the high degree of colocalization between NeuN and brain-reactive autoantibodies, we assumed NeuN was a possible autoantigen. However, WB analysis with HEK293T cell lysates expressing or not expressing the gene encoding for NeuN protein (RIBFOX3) showed that patients\u2019 sera carrying brain-reactive autoantibodies did not recognize the NeuN corresponding band size. Among\nfrontiersin.org01\nFrontiers in Immunology\nthe panel of NPSLE-associated autoantibodies (e.g., anti-NR2, anti-P-ribosomal protein, antiphospholipid) investigated by ELISA assay, only the anti-b2glycoprotein-I (ab2GPI) IgG was exclusively found in those sera containing brain-reactive autoantibodies.\nConclusion: In conclusion, SLE and NPSLE patients possess brain-reactive autoantibodies but with higher frequency and titers found in NPSLE patients. Although many target antigens of brain-reactive autoantibodies are still undetermined, they likely include b2GPI.\nKEYWORDS\nsystemic lupus erythematosus, neuropsychiatric syndromes, autoantibodies, brain, neurons, immunofluorescence"

            "text": "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) is a complex disease characterized by immune system dysregulation. The distinctive SLE characteristic is the production of self-reactive pathogenetic antibodies targeting any tissue or forming immune complexes (1). Moreover, SLE has a wide range of clinical manifestations, including neuropsychiatric (NP) symptoms affecting up to 90% of patients. NPSLE can be related to active disease (primary NPSLE) or organ damage and adverse drug effects (secondary NPSLE), but NP events can also be completely unrelated to SLE, representing accidentally co-occurring disorders (2). Several different manifestations can be observed among patients with NPSLE, and their severity may range from mild symptoms to more severe complications, even though NPSLE is generally associated with higher hospitalization rates and mortality (3, 4). The precise etiology of NPSLE has not been understood yet. However, NP events affecting the central nervous system (CNS) are usually differentiated between inflammatory and ischemic manifestations (5). Inflammatory mechanisms are related to known and unknown autoantibodies, proinflammatory cytokines, blood-brain barrier (BBB) dysfunction, and microangiopathy. In contrast, ischemic events are mainly related to antiphospholipid (aPL) autoantibodies and premature atherosclerosis (6). The attribution of neuropsychiatric events and the classification of the etiopathogenetic mechanisms underlying the individual manifestations of NPSLE is required for a correct therapeutic choice (7, 8). However, specific laboratory and neuroimaging biomarkers in NPSLE are scarce, which undermines the attribution process, especially for common events associated with quality of life impairment, such as seizures, mood disorders, cognitive dysfunction, and headache (9). Autoantibodies against neuronal auto-antigens, as well as other molecules, are among the most promising biomarkers. Circulating anti-P-ribosomal protein (anti-P) antibodies associated with lupus psychosis, depression, and executive dysfunction and their pathogenic mechanism in the brain likely involves perturbation of glutamatergic transmission and\n02\nplasticity (10). Patients with NPSLE have shown antibodies to the DWEYS aminoacidic sequence (11). This sequence is found in the extracellular domain of murine and human N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) subunits NR2a and NR2b (12). Animal modelbased studies demonstrated that anti-NMDAR subunit 2 (antiNR2) antibodies target the hippocampus of mice and lead to the impairment of both spatial cognition and spatial memory through aberrant excitatory signaling, apoptosis, dendritic pruning, and microglial activation (13, 14). The anti-NR2 antibodies may have the same effect in NPSLE patients with cognitive dysfunction. Besides cerebral ischemic events, seizures, cognitive impairment, psychosis, and depression were associated with aPL antibodies (15). However, none of the aforementioned studies can explain the whole spectrum of the neuropsychiatric manifestations observed among NPSLE patients (16).\nThis study aimed to investigate the presence of brain-reacting autoantibodies that could contribute to the picture of CNS manifestations in NPSLE patients. Our approach was based on immunohistochemistry (IHC) (through fluorescence and electron microscopy) to identify the brain areas, neuronal cell type/s, and subcellular areas targeted by the autoantibodies. Since humans and rats could only partially share common epitopes, we used brains from both species. In parallel, we used enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to reveal the presence of known circulating autoantibodies correlating with the IHC data and western blot (WB) analysis to identify the possible molecular autoantibody targets."

The SLE cohort consisted of 36 patients with active inflammatoryNPSLE, enrolled at the time ofCNS events before starting the specific treatment, and 69 consecutive age and gender-matched SLE patientswithout activeNP involvement enrolled in a 1:2 ratio.Diagnosis of SLE was performed according to the 1997 classification criteria proposed by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) (17). Classification of NPSLE manifestation was based on the 1999 ACR nomenclature, and their attributions to SLE and inflammatory nature were defined by expert opinion. According to Zirkzee et al. (5), the classification of inflammatory NPSLE was supported by other organ activemanifestations, C3 or C4 consumption, brainMRI abnormalities, response to immunosuppressive therapy, provided secondary NPSLE and ischemic NPSLE were excluded.\nFrontiers in Immunology 03\nDemographic data, clinical features, and ongoing treatments were recorded.

NPSLE patients also have higher titers (1:120 to 1:500,000 versus 1:60 and 1:60,000 in SLE serum patients; Figures 1L, M). In double experiments, while no co-staining pattern was observed using patient sera (from both SLE and NPSLE) and the anti-microglial marker antibodies (GFAP or -MBP: Figures 2A\u2013P; both rp < 0.5), NeuN antibody and brainreactive autoantibodies stain the same cells (Figures 3A\u2013T; rp > 0.5), confirming thatbrain-reactiveautoantibodies labeledneuronal targets. Colocalization profiles with NeuN were found within the entire brain cortex (virtually all layers), in the majority of pyramidal and granular cells of the hippocampus, and in almost all of the cerebellar granule cells (Figure 3). As to the specific staining patterns within the cells, autoantibody reactivity was found within the nucleus (and rarely within the cytoplasm) in the brain cortex (Figures 3C\u2013G) and cerebellum (Figures 3O\u2013S) or within the cytoplasm (and rarely in the nucleus) in the hippocampus (Figures 3I\u2013M). Since the cerebellum was the region with higher OD values obtained using the NPSLE patient\u2019 sera,webetter focusedondescribing the autoantibody labeling in detail. In this area, autoantibodies brightly labeled the granule cells containing NeuN and weakly stained the Purkinje cells known not to contain NeuN (Figures 4A\u2013C), but no other kinds of cells (Supplementary Material 1). Furthermore, within the granule cells, autoantibody reactivity was mainly found in the nucleus around the nuclear membrane (perinuclear staining) or within the nucleus with granular or mixed staining (Figures 4D\u2013F). These patterns were simultaneously present, sometimes with a preponderance of one compared to the others. As the nucleus of these small cells was difficult to observe by fluorescence microscopy, we used TEM to reveal the subcellular staining of the autoantibodies. Using TEM, patients\u2019 sera mainly labeled the nuclei of the granule cells within the heterochromatin and euchromatin and, to a lesser extent, the\nfrontiersin.org\ncytoplasm andmitochondria (Figure 4G). Reactivity was also detected inPurkinje cells,mainlywithinnuclei, in theRER, and toa lesser extent within cytoplasm and mitochondria (not shown). A similar staining patternwasobservedusing the anti-NeuNantibody in the granule cells (Figure 4H), while no labeling was observed in the Purkinje cells (not shown). Since the cerebellum revealed a heterogenous autoantibody\nFrontiers in Immunology 06\nstaining pattern, we aimed to compare it with the ANA patterns obtained at the sampling time. Sera of NPLSE and SLE patients produced different HEp-2 staining patterns irrespectively of the presence of the rat-brain reactive autoantibodies (Figures 4I\u2013L). The sera showing rat brain-reactive autoantibodies will be called rat-IHC positive (or negative).\nFIGURE 1 Brain reactive autoantibodies in NPSLE and SLE patients. The longitudinal rat brain is represented from the rat brain atlas (A: 6th edition: by George Paxinos and Charls Watson Staining). Autoantibodies (identified with Cy3 red labeling) labeled the entire rat brain with brighter staining in the cerebellum (B), hippocampus (C), and brain cortex (D). Sections incubated using diluent only were completely negative (E\u2013G).

In the brain cortex, statistically significant values were obtained only between NPSLE or SLE vs. HC/MS but not between NPSLE vs. SLE (J).

The preservation of the human brain tissues was checked by using an antibody anti-chromogranin A, which was always positive and whose localization was compatible with its expression in the brain (Figures 5B, L). A positive reaction was observed in 75% and 67% of the rat-IHC positive sera from NPSLE\nFrontiers in Immunology 07\nand SLE patients, respectively. In both brain areas, a positive autoantibody reaction was observed only using the rat-IHC positive sera from both SLE and NPSLE patients (Figures 5C, M) but not using the rat-IHC negative sera (Figures 5D, N). Positive sera labeled both the cytoplasm and nucleus of hippocampus neurons (Figures 5E\u2013G; H\u2013J) as well as the nucleus of the cerebellar granule cells (Figures 5O\u2013Q), whereas the Purkinje cells were never labeled by the rat-IHC positive sera (Figure 5M). Unfortunately, negative staining was revealed using the NeuN antibody, suggesting the susceptibility of this molecule to post-mortem autolysis (not shown).\nFIGURE 2 Brain reactive autoantibodies not decorating microglia. In the coronal sections of the cerebellum and hippocampus, staining patterns of the autoantibodies (A, E, I, M, red labeling) were compared with the anti: -GFAP (B, J, green labeling) and -MBP (F, N, green labeling) but colocalization was not observed (merge C, G, K, O: green + red labeling) as also shown by the Pearson\u2019s coefficient (always <0.5).

None of the rat-IHC positive sera did recognize the bands corresponding to the NeuN protein using RBFOX3-HEK293T cell lysates (Figure 6A).\nAssuming that the molecular target of the autoantibodies contained in the rat-IHC positive sera could be represented by autoantibodies known for their association with NPSLE and SLE (anti-dsDNA, -Ro/SSA, -La/SSB, -RNP, -Sm, -Rib-P, and -DWEYS) their distribution was investigated. All these autoantibodies were present in both the rat-IHC positive and negative sera, suggesting\nFrontiers in Immunology 08\nthey were not responsible for the labeling we observed in rat brain (Figure 6B). However, we found that the ab2GPI IgG were present in the rat-positive IHC sera and were absent in the negative ones, suggesting that they might be part of the heterogeneous autoantibody population responsible for the labeling we observed in rat brain(Figure 6B).\nBrain-reactive autoantibodies and SLE neuropsychiatric manifestations\nThe inflammatory NP manifestations developed by the NPSLE patients enrolled in the study and the associated serologic abnormalities are reported in Table 1.

Nucleus was identified by Hoechst-33342 dye (F, L, R: blue labeling) and used together with serum autoantibodies revealing autoantibody labeling within the nucleus (G, S, blue + red staining; colocalization pattern: violet) or cytoplasm (M, blue + red staining; colocalization pattern: violet).

Only 4 out of 36 NPSLE patients were seronegative for autoantibodies known to be associated with CNS involvement (Figure 7). Brain-reactive autoantibodies were not associated with specific NPSLE manifestations, and the 9 patients who showed rat-IHC-negative sera suffered from cognitive dysfunction (n=2), seizure (n=2), psychosis (n=1), depression (n = 1), maniac disorder (n=1), headache (n=1), and MS-like syndrome (n=1).

Separately analyzing brain MRI findings in NPSLE patients, GMHI were exclusively found in NPSLE patients with brain-reactive autoantibodies (5 out of 19, 26,3%), but their prevalence did not statistically differ from NPSLE patients negative for brain-reactive autoantibodies (0 out of 5, 0%; p = 0.554).

            "text": "The present study revealed that NPSLE and SLE patient sera might carry autoantibodies targeting the entire brain, especially the hippocampus, cerebellum, and cortex. Furthermore, brain-reactive autoantibodies against known and unknown antigens were found more frequently and with higher intensity and titers in NPSLE, suggesting their possible role in the pathogenesis of NPSLE. The exclusive finding of GMHIs on conventional brain MRIs from NPSLE patients positive for brain-reactive autoantibodies may support this hypothesis. Previous studies reported an inflammatory immune response mediated by autoantibodies to brain antigens as responsible for GMHIs (23). In contrast, vascular changes mediated by accelerated atherosclerosis are claimed as responsible for brain atrophy (24, 25), which may suggest an underlying alternative pathogenetic mechanism in those NPSLE patients that were negative for brain-reactive autoantibodies. On the other hand, the high percentage of SLE patients carrying brain-reactive autoantibodies without neurologic symptoms might suggest they lack a pathogenetic effect. However, the complement cascade activation demonstrated by the significantly lower serum levels of C3 and C4 observed in our cohort of NPSLE patients may provide indirect evidence of a pathogenetic effect of brain-reactive antibodies in this group.\nBA\nFIGURE 6 Searching for autoantibody targets. NeuN is not a brain-reactive autoantibodies target (A) HEK293T cells were transfected either with a vector containing the RBFOX3 gene (+) or with an empty vector (-). Anti-NeuN antibody recognized the corresponding bands (48/46 kDa) on transfected HEK293T cells only, while the autoantibodies from five different patients\u2019 sera with SLE and NPSLE (3 IHC-positive and 2 IHC-negative sera) did not recognize a corresponding band. The bar charts show the percentage of the known autoantibodies in the rat-IHC positive and negative sera from NPSLE and SLE patients (B). Anti -dsDNA, -Ro/SSA, -La/SSB, RNP, -Sm, -Rib-P, -DWEYS, were present in both rat IHC positive and negative sera instead the anti-PL including LAC, -IgG CL, -IgM Cl, -IgG \u00df2GP1, -IgM \u00df2GP1 were virtually negative in the rat-IHC negative sera from NPSLE.\nFIGURE 7 Autoantibodies associated with inflammatory NPSLE. The Venn diagram shows the number and percentage of positive autoantibodies from the group of NPSLE patients and highlights the possible overlap of the autoantibodies considered relevant in the inflammatory involvement observed in SLE patients. Among 36 patients with NPSLE, only 4 were seronegative for these autoantibodies. Anti-P: anti-P-ribosomal protein. aDWEYS: antibodies to the aminoacidic sequence DWEYS found in the murine and human N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor subunits NR2. BRAbs: brain-reactive autoantibodies. aPL: antiphospholipid antibodies.\nfrontiersin.org\nComplement cascade activation is primarily responsible for BBB and B-CSF disruption (26), and it may account for higher circulating brain-reactive antibodies access to the CNS environment in NPSLE than in SLE patients. Brain-reactive autoantibodies need to access the CNS environment in vivo through a blood-brain barrier (BBB) or blood-cerebrospinal fluid (B-CSF) barrier leakage to bind neuronal cells, causing apoptotic cell death, microglial activation, synaptic pruning, and reduced synaptic density (27, 28). Unfortunately, for ethical reasons, we could not check for brain-reactive autoantibodies positivity in CSF, which represents a major limitation of our study.\nIn the preliminary stage of this study, we investigated whether the rat-IHC positive sera included known autoantibodies (e.g., ANA) and were directed against defined antigens (e.g., anti-Sm, anti-P, anti-NR2). Although ANA can target any epitope within the nucleus, regardless of the cellular type used, we did not reveal any immunostaining reaction using rat brain sections in 44.9% and 25% of ANA HEp-2 positive sera collected from SLE and NPSLE, respectively. Furthermore, double staining experiments using the rat-IHC positive sera and commercial antibodies that mark neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes showed that brainreactive autoantibodies labeled only neurons and not glial cells. If we could have detected by IHC the same ANA revealed through HEp-2, such autoantibodies would have labeled both neuron and glial cells. That could be explained by the differences in detecting ANA according to the substrates used because cell-based assays could reveal different epitopes than tissue-based assays. Among the known autoantibodies tested, only the anti-b2GPI were detected in the rat-positive IHC sera and were virtually absent in the negative ones suggesting they may be part of the heterogeneous autoantibody population responsible for the labeling we observed in rat brains. Indeed, the aPL and especially the anti-b2GPI could target neurons of the human brain, and patients with these autoantibodies were found to be more prone to exhibit seizures, cognitive impairment, psychosis, and depression compared to seronegative ones (15, 29, 30).\nFrontiers in Immunology 12\nFinally, we tried to find a potential neuronal target for brainreactive autoantibodies. The fact that the autoantibodies labeled NeuN-containing cells within the entire brain lead us to believe that NeuNmight be one of the possible main autoantigens recognized by the autoantibodies. NeuN is a neuronal nuclear protein with a mass of around 46/48 kDa and is coded by the RNA Binding Fox-1 Homolog 3 (RBFOX3) gene (31). It plays an essential role in regulating the transcription and RNA processing of many genes involved in the maturation of neurons (32). NeuN is widely used as a post-mitotic neuronalmarker, and only a fewneurons donot express this protein, such as the Purkinje cells (33, 34). Moreover, RBFOX3 mutations are linked to epilepsy (35) and cognitive impairments (36), whileRBFOX3knockoutmicehave ahigher riskof developing seizures and anxiety-related behavior disorders (37). Thus, our hypothesis that autoantibodies recognized NeuN was also compatible with its involvement in neuropsychiatric symptoms. Furthermore, NeuN localizes in most neurons\u2019 nuclei or perinuclear cytoplasm. Due to these reasons, it is considered the perfect marker for staining neurons (38). However, we proved that NeuNwas not the autoantibody target.\nThe present study has several limitations. First, we did not test the positivity of brain-reactive antibodies in the CSF from NPSLE and SLE patients. The ethical reason behind this limitation lies in the observational design of the present study, which prevented us from performing a lumbar puncture to collect CSF in SLE patients without neuropsychiatric manifestations and in mild to moderate NPSLE patients for whom such an invasive procedure was considered unnecessary. Therefore, confirming the presence of brain-reactive autoantibodies in the CSF represents an important future perspective. Second, we did not identify a new autoantibodies specificity in the brain, and we did not perform functional investigations, which are a primary focus in NPSLE research. Since the target antigens were intraneuronal, proving brainreactive autoantibodies can perturb neuronal function would be paramount to confirm their pathogenetic effect in NPSLE patients. On the other hand, the general cytosolic pattern we observed in IF\nfrontier\nsin.org\nand TEM does not exclude cross-reactivity with neuronal membrane proteins, as lately demonstrated for the anti-P reacting with the neuronal surface antigen (10) and for anti-dsDNA reacting with NR2 (11) to exert their pathogenetic effects. Future experiments should investigate the functional effect of brainreactive antibodies on brain function in vitro and in vivo through advanced imaging techniques. Furthermore, testing the effect of incorporating brain-reactive antibodies in the performance of algorithms for attributing neuropsychiatric events in SLE would be a further important point in the research agenda (39).\nIn conclusion, the data obtained from this study demonstrate that (a) SLE and NPSLE patients could possess autoantibodies potentially reacting to neuronal cells, with higher frequency and titers in NPSLE according to the broad spectrum of the neurological symptoms; (b) the whole brain but in particular the cortex, the hippocampus, and the cerebellum could be the target of brainreactive autoantibodies mainly directed against unknown antigens; (c) anti-b2GPI could be part of the autoimmune reaction occurring at the brain level. However, further studies are needed to disentangle the specificity of brain-reactive autoantibodies in SLE patients."
