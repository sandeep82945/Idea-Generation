Experimental Validation of Theoretical Predictions: Conduct experimental studies to validate the theoretical predictions made by the multi-mode framework. This could involve designing and executing experiments to measure FGR rate constants in systems coupled to multiple cavity modes and comparing these results with the predictions to verify the accuracy and applicability of the theoretical model.

Investigation of Non-Marcus Behavior in Multi-Mode Cavity Systems: While the study focuses on the Marcus limit of FGR rate theory, exploring the behavior of systems that do not adhere to Marcus theory in the context of multiple cavity modes would be insightful. This could involve studying systems with non-Gaussian nuclear dynamics or those operating outside the high-temperature limit to see how multi-mode coupling affects their rate constants.

Cavity Geometry and Material Effects on Rate Constants: Delve into how different cavity geometries (beyond the two-dimensional cases considered) and materials (varying refractive indices, mirror properties, etc.) influence the enhancement of FGR rate constants. This would help in understanding the role of photonic environment characteristics in optimizing reaction rates and could lead to the design of tailored cavities for specific reactions.

Quantum Coherence Effects in Multi-Mode Cavity Systems: Investigate the role of quantum coherence in systems coupled to multiple cavity modes. Given the quantum nature of the cavity-photon interactions, it would be interesting to see how coherence between different cavity modes or between the system and the cavity modes influences the reaction dynamics and rate constants.

Application to Photocatalysis and Quantum Technologies: Apply the insights gained from studying multi-mode cavity systems to enhance photocatalytic processes and develop quantum technologies. For example, the enhanced rate constants observed in multi-mode cavities could be exploited in designing more efficient photocatalysts, or the principles could be applied in quantum computing and sensing technologies where control over reaction rates at the quantum level is beneficial.
