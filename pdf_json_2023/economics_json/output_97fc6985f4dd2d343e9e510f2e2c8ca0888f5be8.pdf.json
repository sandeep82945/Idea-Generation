    "abstractText": "Entrepreneurial universities have emerged to promote entrepreneurial intention and increase business success among young people. An entrepreneurial intention study has been carried out with the aim of determining the effectiveness of current entrepreneurship programs and the influence of entrepreneurial education on entrepreneurial intention. The methodology used for statistical analysis of the data collected by a survey is Structural Equation Modeling. Results show that entrepreneurship education does not have a positive and significant relationship with entrepreneurial intention and its antecedents, reflecting the lack of effectiveness of entrepreneurship programs offered in Madrid universities. Futhermore, it has been empirically demonstrated that subjective norms, entrepreneurial capabilities, and perceived control are positively related to the entrepreneurial intention of university students. It is recommended to establish relationships with external companies and organize conferences, talks, and presentations to improve the image of entrepreneurs. It is also worth noting the establishment of relationships with environmental agents such as business incubators and scientific parks, to develop the creativity of university students and improve their ability to identify business opportunities, as well as to play a supportive and motivational role so that young people can put their entrepreneurial idea into practice.

An entrepreneurial intention study has been carried out with the aim of determining the effectiveness of current entrepreneurship programs and the influence of entrepreneurial education on entrepreneurial intention. The methodology used for statistical analysis of the data collected by a survey is Structural Equation Modeling. Results show that entrepreneurship education does not have a positive and significant relationship with entrepreneurial intention and its antecedents, reflecting the lack of effectiveness of entrepreneurship programs offered in Madrid universities. Futhermore, it has been empirically demonstrated that subjective norms, entrepreneurial capabilities, and perceived control are positively related to the entrepreneurial intention of university students. It is recommended to establish relationships with external companies and organize conferences, talks, and presentations to improve the image of entrepreneurs. It is also worth noting the establishment of relationships with environmental agents such as business incubators and scientific parks, to develop the creativity of university students and improve their ability to identify business opportunities, as well as to play a supportive and motivational role so that young people can put their entrepreneurial idea into practice.\nINDEX TERMS entrepreneurship education, entrepreneurial intention, entrepreneur, entrepreneurial universities\nI. INTRODUCTION\nEntrepreneurship plays a crucial role in the economic development of a country, as it stimulates technological innovation and increases economic efficiency by generating new employment opportunities [1]. Therefore, developing and promoting new entrepreneurs has become a common goal for public organizations [2].\nEntrepreneurship is carried out when the individual is confident in his business project and has the necessary resources to undertake it to create value through the identification of opportunities in the market and the creation of innovative ideas for the satisfaction of consumers [3,4]. Entrepreneurship is a programmed behavior in which different personal and environmental variables are evaluated\n[5]. Given the importance of entrepreneurship, numerous studies have been conducted to analyze entrepreneurial intention, as it has been shown to be the most critical predictor of entrepreneurial behavior in the future [6].\nIntention is defined as the psychological state of an individual through which will and motivation towards a particular behavior are expressed. In other words, intention determines the way one acts and the decision to carry out a predicted action in the future [7]. Therefore, entrepreneurial intention is a necessary condition for individuals to feel prepared for entrepreneurship [4,8]. In this sense, universities play a fundamental role in the transfer of entrepreneurial skills and abilities necessary for the constitution of a new company, which will allow university students to take the opportunities captured from the market to entrepreneurial action; thus, entrepreneurship education is essential to increase entrepreneurial success [9,10].\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\nVOLUME XX, 2017 1\nEntrepreneurship education has been a much-studied topic due to its importance for promoting entrepreneurship [11,12]. The promotion of different training activities to develop entrepreneurship in universities has received special attention in recent years [13].\nHowever, in the universities of the Community of Madrid, there is little entrepreneurial intention among university students. According to a study carried out by Alvarez, DeNoble, and Jung, university students have stated that the lack of economic resources and, above all, the lack of entrepreneurial skills (skills, abilities, and access to professional networks) are the main barriers to start a business. The lack of effectiveness of current entrepreneurship programs on the development of entrepreneurial skills can be appreciated [14].\nNumerous models have been used to study entrepreneurial intention, and Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior has been the most widely used, as evidenced by the literature [15]. This model validates that the determinants of entrepreneurial intention are attitude towards entrepreneurship, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; the latter is strongly linked to self-efficacy. According to Ajzen, all behaviors require prior planning, so entrepreneurial behavior can be predicted through entrepreneurial intention [16].\nThis study aims to determine how entrepreneurship education, attitudes, subjective norms, and the perception of control influence the entrepreneurial intentions of Chinese students in universities in the Community of Madrid, as well as to assess the importance of different educational activities on their entrepreneurial spirit.\nThe results of this study will allow institutions to identify better the factors that influence entrepreneurial intention. Thus, actions can be taken to work on factors that should be enhanced to promote entrepreneurship in universities. The entrepreneurial intention model presented here will also provide value for academics who want to delve deeper into this area of research.\nThe article is structured as follows: Introduction, literature review, materials and methods, results, and conclusions of the study."

            "text": "Entrepreneurship is booming, as entrepreneurial activity constitutes one of the main instruments for developing economies, so the development and promotion of new entrepreneurs has become a common goal for public organizations [2].\nIntention is a key dimension of 'people's behavior and constitutes one of the best indicators of future behavior [17]. Entrepreneurial intention has been defined as an action oriented towards creating or promoting start-up growth [18]. This means that creating a new firm is a planned action comprising a group of steps, and the intention becomes the starting point of the process. Therefore, entrepreneurial\nintention has been understood as a need to activate entrepreneurial behavior [19].\nEntrepreneurial intention has become a topic of great interest in recent years due to its contribution to the economic development of countries, the generation of employment, the improvement of quality of life, and the promotion of innovation [20]. Furthermore, the study of the intention predictors is key to understanding entrepreneurship since the beliefs, desires, and incorporation of a new venture are described through these [21,22]. Additionally, entrepreneurship exerts a great influence on behavior, which will lead the student to the decision to start a business in the future [6]. The development of student entrepreneurship should emerge at the university level, as universities are responsible for equipping students with the skills necessary for entrepreneurship through activities such as project work, research classes, market research, marketing strategies, and human resource management. All these are considered necessary skills for entrepreneurship and will help transform captured opportunities into entrepreneurial actions [23,24].\nEntrepreneurship education is positively related to entrepreneurial intention [12], as it equips university students with the necessary skills to recognize opportunities in the market through the promotion of self-esteem, intuition, and the necessary competencies [25]. In addition, conducting activities such as projects, workshops, competitions, cooperatives, and internships also helps 'generate universitystudents' entrepreneurial intention [24]. Therefore, implementing activities based on practices and experiences, as well as activities for reinforcing skills and behavioral security, will help reduce fears, thus enhancing theindividual's perception of control [26].\nEntrepreneurship education also exerts a strong influence on the perceptions of university students in the field of decision-making about undertaking entrepreneurial actions, prompting them to consider entrepreneurship as a good option to access the world of work [27].\nConsidering that entrepreneurship requires several specific skills and competencies, and universities are understood as the main institutions for the transfer of this knowledge [28], we can conclude that entrepreneurial intention is largely reinforced by entrepreneurship education [29]. Based on this description, we formulate the following hypotheses:\nH1: Entrepreneurship education has a positive and significant relationship with the entrepreneurial intention of university students.\nWe also studied the relationship between entrepreneurship education and the antecedents of entrepreneurial intention derived from the Theory (attitudes towards entrepreneurship, subjective norms, and the individual's perception of control). Entrepreneurship education improves the perceived abilities, knowledge, and attitudes towards entrepreneurship, enhancing university\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\nVOLUME XX, 2017 1\nstudents' learning orientation and self-efficacy [30,31,32]. Entrepreneurship education also positively impacts individuals' subjective norms, as it plays a key role in socializing people into entrepreneurial careers [33]. Entrepreneurship education also has a positive and significant relationship with the perception of control since it improves entrepreneurial and practical administrative skills [34,35]. Entrepreneurship education enhances entrepreneurial self-efficacy by promoting vicarious experiences, verbal persuasion, and emotional arousal. In this way, the viability of university students towards creating their own businesses is improved [36,37].\nSeveral studies have analyzed the impact of entrepreneurship education on the antecedents of entrepreneurial intention. Among these, according to the study done by V\u00e9lez, Bustamante, Loor, and Afcha, entrepreneurship education also improves entrepreneurial skills [35]. This enhances practical management skills and fosters attitudes and values related to entrepreneurship. On the other hand, according to Bravo, Bravo, Preciado, and Mendoza, entrepreneurship education does not have a direct relationship with the entrepreneurial intention of university students but rather fosters the perception of behavioral control [20]. Along the same line, we can find the study conducted by L\u00f3pez, Ariza, and L\u00f3pez, who also found that entrepreneurship education does not directly correlate with the entrepreneurial intention [37]. However, it fosters a positive attitude towards creating a new business and entrepreneurial self-efficacy. Finally, according to Osuna, Corral, and Pe\u00f1uelas, entrepreneurship education has a positive relationship with attitudes, subjective norms, and university students' perception of entrepreneurship [38].\nBased on this background, the following hypotheses are\nformulated:\nH2: Entrepreneurship education has a positive and significant relationship with attitudes towards entrepreneurship among university students.\nH3: Entrepreneurship education has a positive and significant relationship with the subjective norms of university students.\nH4: Entrepreneurship education presents a positive and significant relationship with perceived control towards the entrepreneurial behavior of university students.\nH5: Entrepreneurship education has a positive and significant relationship with the entrepreneurial skills of university students. Ajzen's theory of planned behavior can explain why people choose or have an interest in starting their own businesses. This model studies the reasons for human behavior to predict future actions by studying the determinants of entrepreneurial intention [16]:\nAttitude. Positive or negative perceptions of beliefs and opinions about something [16]. A positive attitude towards entrepreneurship is formed when the individual perceives it as desirable and with benefits derived from it [39]. Several\nstudies have contrasted the positive influence of attitude on entrepreneurial intention [39,40]. Therefore, the following hypothesis is presented:\nH6: Attitude towards entrepreneurship impacts in a positive and significant way on the entrepreneurial intention of university students.\nSubjective norms. It refers to the extent to which an action is aligned with people close to the actor, such as family and friends [16]. Subjective norms refer to an individual's perceived support from close people and their motivation to comply with the wishes of important people [19]. Within the support of people important to the individual, the role of parents is noteworthy, as parental support for entrepreneurship significantly influences the individual's entrepreneurial decisions by enhancing, through exposure mechanisms, the perception of desirability and entrepreneurial viability [41]. Similarly, Wang, Wang, and Chen concluded that perceived entrepreneurial rewards from parents also foster individuals' entrepreneurial intention, which is also related to entrepreneurial self-efficacy [42]. Based on this background, the following hypothesis is presented:\nH7: Subjective norms impact in a positive and significant way with the entrepreneurial intention of university students.\nPerception of behavioral control. It refers to how difficult it is for a person to perceive an action [16]. Whenever a person believes that he/she has the required skills to start a company and understands that the process is feasible, he/she will feel empowered to start the business [21,43]. People'People's skills and abilities are determined by their self-efficacy. Entrepreneurship education provides students with the skills and abilities they need to start a company [44]. It has been empirically demonstrated that the most influential personal factors on the entrepreneurial intention of university students are the skills, abilities, and capacities towards entrepreneurship since, from these, the security of the process and the preparation for the management of critical situations are increased [24]. Based on this background, we formulate the following hypotheses:\nH8: The perception of control impacts in a positive and significant way with the entrepreneurial intention of university students.\nH9: The skills of university students show a positive and significant relationship with the entrepreneurial intention of university students."

It also combines and confronts hypotheses with empirical data, making it a confirmatory rather than an exploratory model. The structural equation model is characterized by the possibility of evaluating multiple and cross-dependence relationships and by estimating measurement error in the estimation process, which allows the analysis of relationships by each subset of variables, which enables the study of the interrelationship between variables in different groups [45,46]. Structural equation modeling was chosen because our study is an exploratory analysis in which multiple relationships are considered.\nThe sample was formed by Chinese students attending universities in the Community of Madrid in the 2020-2021 academic year, as the surveys were disseminated from January 09, 2021, to March 04, 2021, through Google Forms.\nThe study was conducted using convenience sampling. That is, it was decided to carry out the sample by accessibility, resorting to subjects who are part of the researcher's environment, making this data collection method more accessible to them, and it is still a random mechanism. Hence, it is also valid and constitutes one of the methods most used by less experienced researchers and students. Convenience sampling is justified under the following conditions: difficulty of access to the material (in this research, due to the geographical restrictions caused by Covid-19), scarcity of economic resources and time to generate a random sample, investigation of a novel area of research and the exploratory nature of the study. In nonprobabilistic samples, the conclusions are difficult to extrapolate to the universe, which is why we are more interested in deepening rather than generalizing, which could, to some extent, overcome the limitation of the small sample size. Although the sample is small, it is considered significant because it is prepared to reach Chinese students\nstudying at universities in the Community of Madrid with different entrepreneurial profiles regarding age, sex, and subjects. We consider that the sample is sufficient for the research. However, it is necessary to increase the sample size to achieve more comprehensive results that can be extrapolated to the universe.\nOnce the sample we address has been defined, we formulate the questions to contrast the nine hypotheses formulated.\nTable 1 shows the primary antecedents of the studied\nvariables."

            "text": "According to the literature, entrepreneurship education should be positively related to the entrepreneurial intention of university students [12]. However, according to the results obtained in this study, entrepreneurship education is not related to entrepreneurial intention. This could be because, in Spain, the entrepreneurship education that entrepreneurs receive is not oriented to training them in entrepreneurship, and there is little training to create, which is basic to train new entrepreneurs. This problem is also reflected in the GEM report, in which experts have rated with 5.1 out of 10 the effectiveness of education and entrepreneurial training in the post-school stage, ranking fifth in terms of obstacles to entrepreneurship [49]. The\nresults of our model show the problem of the low effectiveness of entrepreneurship programs (H1). Therefore, this factor must be improved to strengthen entrepreneurship in Spain. It should also be noted that the activities most valued by respondents for the promotion of entrepreneurship are participation in projects, programs, or awards aimed at young entrepreneurs, contact or internships with experts or entrepreneurs in the locality, and guided visits to companies, organizations, or other associations [50].\nIn the same area, according to a study by Chang and Wannamakok, entrepreneurship education provides university students with the knowledge and skills necessary for entrepreneurship. However, it decreases motivation towards creating a new company since it realizes intense competition within the business world and high rates of business failure, causing feeling insecure, and thus increasing the fear of failure [51]. Therefore, the high level of perceived risk is one of the biggest obstacles to entrepreneurship [52].\nThe low effectiveness of the current entrepreneurship programs in Madrid universities could translate into the need for restructuring the curricula, focused on practice in order to bring students as close as possible to the business world,\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\nVOLUME XX, 2017 1\nproviding them with the knowledge and experience necessary for entrepreneurship, as well as the importance of advice, support, and help at the time of entrepreneurship by university students, which will help to reduce the fear of failure. [50]. It must also be considered that the entrepreneurial spirit must be implemented and promoted in the entire university community, arousing interest and motivation towards creating a new company. So, there is enough potential to improve entrepreneurship courses and students' extracurricular activities [52],\nFinally, higher education institutions should implement control measures for entrepreneurship programs, since in addition to the design of entrepreneurship education programs, these should be maintained or adjusted through constant evaluation to measure their viability and effectiveness for the transfer of entrepreneurship [53].\nEntrepreneurship education should also have a positive and significant relationship with the antecedents of Theory. Universities also ensure that students perceive entrepreneurship as a rational and viable alternative [54]. According to Krueger and Brazeal [33], entrepreneurship education fosters 'individuals' subjective norms, as it plays a fundamental role in the socialization of people in entrepreneurial careers. Osuna, Corral and Pe\u00f1uelas, tested this hypothesis [38]. Entrepreneurship education has also been shown to improve an individual's perception of control, as it improves their perceived capabilities, knowledge, and attitudes towards entrepreneurship [30]. Entrepreneurship education is positively related to entrepreneurial capabilities, as it enhances college students' learning orientation and selfefficacy [31].\nHowever, according to the results obtained in our study, entrepreneurship education does not have a significant relationship with attitudes, subjective norms, perceptions of control, or entrepreneurial skills. This could be because the impact of entrepreneurship education alone on entrepreneurial intention is not significant but rather through other factors [20]. Similarly, S\u00e1nchez-Garc\u00eda, Ward, Hern\u00e1ndez, and Florez concluded that entrepreneurship education could have a negative effect on the development of skills and attitudes toward entrepreneurship [53]. According to another study by Bravo, Bravo, Preciado, and Mendoza, entrepreneurship education did not have a positive relationship with attitudes towards entrepreneurship, subjective norms, or university students' entrepreneurial intention [20]. Undoubtedly, good entrepreneurship education should foster university 'students' entrepreneurial intention, so universities should pay more attention to the transfer of entrepreneurship in the classroom to encourage young and innovative entrepreneurship. Educational systems do not promote creativity, which is essential for entrepreneurship. Deficiency is seen in terms of transferring skills for opportunity recognition and problems solving. For entrepreneurship education to be effective, universities\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\n8 VOLUME XX, 2017\nshould strive to break with the old paradigms and pedagogical models [55]. However, this is not an easy and quick task, as it requires philosophical changes and changes in institutional orientation [20]. In addition, Universities and the State also have the responsibility for the development and promotion of university entrepreneurs through the creation of links between universities, business incubators, and research centers on entrepreneurship [56]. Since all the resources provided by the universities for learning and creation of experiences will help significantly at the time of incorporation of a new company by students [57,58].\nAccording to data published by the GEM (2022), entrepreneurship education has improved over the last few years, with recent entrepreneurs (TEA) reporting higher entrepreneurship-specific training than established entrepreneurs in 2021. However, entrepreneurship education outcomes have been low, so much remains to be done [59].\nSpain has high rates of entrepreneurship, but most are out of necessity. In other words, people create companies because they cannot find work for others. According to the latest GEM report published in 2021, 75% of consolidated companies stated that their reason for entrepreneurship was \"To earn a living because work is scarce\".\" We can also appreciate that most Spanish entrepreneurs are not young, as in 2021, 41.2% of consolidated companies were set up by individuals aged 55-64 and only 0.7% by 18-24 years old, and 5.2% by individuals aged 25-34, this may reflect the low rates of entrepreneurship among university students. Regarding the level of education, 29% of consolidated entrepreneurs had university studies, while the majority had primary or secondary education levels [49]. With all these data, we can see that few university students go out into the labor market with the idea of entrepreneurship; instead, it is older people and those with needs who are driven to entrepreneurship. Concerning the variables of Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior, we found that, according to previous literature, a positive attitude towards entrepreneurship is formed when the individual perceives it as desirable and with benefits derived from them, which has a positive relationship with the entrepreneurial intention [16,39,51]. This relationship was not observed in our study. The main reason for our results could be that a positive attitude towards entrepreneurship is insufficient to initiate entrepreneurial intention. Entrepreneurs may need to perceive control and feel more secure with the viability of starting a new firm process [50]. On the other hand, support from parents, friends, university professors, and other important people for the university student positively influences the development of entrepreneurial intention. It motivates them to carry out entrepreneurship [38,51]. Our study is in line with these authors, as higher scores on subjective norms are related to university 'students' higher entrepreneurial intentions of university students [20,60]. Our study is in line with the\nprevious literature, as higher scores on perceived control are related to university 'students' higher entrepreneurial intention. Finally, it has been empirically demonstrated that the most influential personal factors on the entrepreneurial intention of university students are skills, abilities, and capacities towards entrepreneurship since these increase the security of the process and preparation for handling critical situations [24]. Similarly, our study shows that the greater the perceptions of entrepreneurial skills, the greater the entrepreneurial intentions of university students."

            "text": "Entrepreneurship is booming, as business activity is one of the main instruments for developing economies, generating employment and innovation, and improving the quality of life of society. Universities and the State play a fundamental role in the preparation of new entrepreneurs and in entrepreneurial impulse, so they must be committed to the promotion of entrepreneurial intention both in the academic environment and in daily life.\nThis research shows that entrepreneurship education does not have a positive and significant relationship with attitudes towards entrepreneurship, subjective norms, perceived control, or entrepreneurial skills of university students. In relation to the variables of Ajzen's Theory of Planned Behavior, attitudes towards entrepreneurship of university students are not positively related to their entrepreneurial intention, whereas subjective norms strongly determine university 'students' entrepreneurial intention, perceived control, and entrepreneurial capabilities.\nThe results of our study reflect the low effectiveness of entrepreneurship programs in universities in Madrid. Given the importance of entrepreneurship education for the promotion of university 'students' entrepreneurial intentions, higher education institutions should pay more attention to the promotion of entrepreneurship education, requiring curricular restructuring, that is, an educational transformation that allows the promotion of new enterprises.\nThis study contributes to the literature on the relationship between entrepreneurship education and entrepreneurial intention, helping future researchers to take them as a basis or complement in their research, since it is interesting to continue to deepen this topic to update university programs by studying the level of the entrepreneurial intention of students and the different variables that determine it. This work will also help universities understand the current state of the effectiveness of entrepreneurship programs and the most valued activities for the promotion of entrepreneurship. Our results can also contribute to the implementation of new policies for the promotion of entrepreneurship among university students, which promote more practical activities, workshops, seminars, and lectures to improve students' attitudes towards entrepreneurship and develop\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

Some of the suggestions for supporting students in their entrepreneurial process by universities would be the establishment of relationships with external companies to make visits and provide work experience to students, as well as the provision of workshops where students can put into practice what they have learned, and conferences, lectures, and presentations of successful entrepreneurs to improve the figure of the entrepreneur in the minds of young people. It is also worth mentioning the establishment of relationships with agents in the environment, such as business incubators and science parks, to develop the creativity of university students and improve their ability to identify business opportunities, as well as to play the role of supporting and motivating organizations for young entrepreneurs so that they can put into practice the entrepreneurial idea they have in mind. This will increase students' attitudes toward entrepreneurship and their perception of control of the entrepreneurial process.\nTherefore, there is still much to be done, since despite the crucial role played by universities as promoters of entrepreneurship among the new generations, current entrepreneurship education programs do not seem to have a significant impact on the development of entrepreneurial intention or its antecedents (attitude, subjective norms, perception of control, and capabilities).\nAs for the study's limitations, it should be noted that it is a preliminary and exploratory analysis, so it is difficult to extrapolate the results at this time and draw general conclusions. Although sufficient, the sample was scarce and geographically limited.\nConcerning future lines of research, it would be interesting to conduct a statistical analysis of the different entrepreneurship programs carried out by different universities in Madrid to assess the effectiveness of each. In addition to carrying out a process of subclassifying the sample to identify the different dimensions, traits, and entrepreneurial intention that they possess and compare them. As we have seen, more than half of the hypotheses have not been accepted, possibly because we have applied the entrepreneurial intention study model to an entirely new sample, especially one with different cultural aspects. We want to continue our research to determine the aspects that make the Chinese community have an entrepreneurial culture, such as questions regarding psychological factors that affect the entrepreneurial intentions of individuals and the motivations for and obstacles to entrepreneurship. Regarding the study methodology, a SEM analysis (linear analysis) has been used. Therefore, the development of a non-linear structural equation model for the study of the sample is proposed as a future line of research, which could allow obtaining results that may be closer to reality.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.
