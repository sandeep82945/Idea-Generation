    "abstractText": "Realization of a room-temperature ultrafast photon-number-resolving quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement would have significant implications for photonic quantum information processing, enabling, for example, deterministic quantum computation in discrete-variable architectures, but the requirement for strong coupling has hampered the development of scalable implementations. In this work, we propose and analyze a nonlinear-optical route to photon-number-resolving QND using quadratic (i.e., \u03c7(2)) nonlinear interactions. We show that the coherent pump field driving a frequency-detuned optical parametric amplifier (OPA) experiences displacements conditioned on the number of signal Bogoliubov excitations. A measurement of the pump displacement thus provides a QND measurement of the signal Bogoliubov excitations, projecting the signal mode to a squeezed photon-number state. We then show how our nonlinear OPA dynamics can be utilized to deterministically generate Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states with only additional Gaussian resources, offering an all-optical route for fault-tolerant quantum information processing in continuous-variable systems. Finally, we place these QND schemes into a more traditional context by highlighting analogies between the frequency-detuned optical parametric oscillator and multilevel atom-cavity quantum electrodynamics systems by showing how continuous monitoring of the outcoupled pump quadrature induces conditional localization of the intracavity signal mode onto squeezed photon-number states. Our analysis suggests that our proposal may be viable in near-term \u03c7(2) nonlinear nanophotonics, highlighting the rich potential of the OPA as a universal tool for ultrafast non-Gaussian quantum state engineering and quantum computation.",

In this work, we propose and analyze a nonlinear-optical route to photon-number-resolving QND using quadratic (i.e., \u03c7(2)) nonlinear interactions. We show that the coherent pump field driving a frequency-detuned optical parametric amplifier (OPA) experiences displacements conditioned on the number of signal Bogoliubov excitations. A measurement of the pump displacement thus provides a QND measurement of the signal Bogoliubov excitations, projecting the signal mode to a squeezed photon-number state. We then show how our nonlinear OPA dynamics can be utilized to deterministically generate Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill states with only additional Gaussian resources, offering an all-optical route for fault-tolerant quantum information processing in continuous-variable systems. Finally, we place these QND schemes into a more traditional context by highlighting analogies between the frequency-detuned optical parametric oscillator and multilevel atom-cavity quantum electrodynamics systems by showing how continuous monitoring of the outcoupled pump quadrature induces conditional localization of the intracavity signal mode onto squeezed photon-number states. Our analysis suggests that our proposal may be viable in near-term \u03c7(2) nonlinear nanophotonics, highlighting the rich potential of the OPA as a universal tool for ultrafast non-Gaussian quantum state engineering and quantum computation.\nDOI: 10.1103/PRXQuantum.4.010333\nI. INTRODUCTION\nQuantum information science and engineering offer great potential for revolutionizing many fields, such as computation [1], communication [2], and metrology [3]. Among various physical systems that have been experimented with to encode and process quantum information, photonics offers significant advantages in roomtemperature scalability and ultrafast operations [4].

Further distribution of this work must maintain attribution to the author(s) and the published article\u2019s title, journal citation, and DOI.\nphotons can span terahertz bandwidths and propagate over long distances with little decoherence, making them an ideal carrier of quantum information. In photonic quantum computation, information can be encoded and processed in both discrete-variable (DV) [5,6] and continuous-variable (CV) [7,8] architectures. However, the lack of strong optical nonlinearity has hindered the realization of deterministic two-qubit entangling gates in DV architectures [9\u201311] and non-Gaussian resources such as Gottesman-KitaevPreskill (GKP) states [12\u201315] in CV architectures; both of these are essential for building universal fault-tolerant quantum information processors. While some limitations of weak optical nonlinearity can be circumvented through measurement-based nonlinear operations using photonnumber-resolving (PNR) measurement [16], the intrinsically probabilistic nature of these operations and the slow speed of conventional single-photon detectors (e.g., superconducting nanowires [17] and superconducting transitionedge sensors [18,19]) with complex cryogenic systems\n2691-3399/23/4(1)/010333(15) 010333-1 Published by the American Physical Society\nseverely limit the scalability and computation clock rates in these architectures [9\u201311].\nIn this context, a realization of ultrafast, roomtemperature PNR quantum nondemolition (QND) measurement [20\u201323] has significant implications in both DV and CV systems. In a PNR QND measurement, information about the number of photons is encoded in an auxiliary probe, and backaction is limited to (partial) projection onto a corresponding photon-number eigenstate [24,25]. Such an ultrafast QND measurement can not only replace the use of conventional superconducting PNR detectors but can also directly realize a deterministic twoqubit entangling gate, which enables deterministic DV optical quantum computation [26\u201328]. Additionally, the QND nature of the measurement offers unique opportunities for quantum engineering [29\u201331], communication [32], and metrology [33,34]. To realize a PNR QND measurement, it is typically necessary to engineer a resolvable single-photon energy shift, effectively leading to a strong coupling requirement g/\u03ba > 1 (with coherent coupling rate g and decoherence rate \u03ba). Since the pioneering work in atom-cavity quantum electrodynamics (QED) [35\u201339], strong coupling has been demonstrated in various physical systems [40\u201342]. However, concomitant implementations of the QND measurement in a scalable, high-bandwidth, and room-temperature platform have yet to be achieved.\nIn this work, we propose and analyze a nonlinear-optical route to PNR QND measurements and all-optical quantum state engineering for GKP states using a quadratic optical parametric amplifier (OPA). Compared with existing PNR QND measurement proposals [20\u201323] and GKP-state generation schemes [43,44] using cubic nonlinearities, our proposal with an OPA uses much stronger quadratic nonlinearity [45], offering a more experimentally viable route. Recently, g/\u03ba \u223c 0.01 was demonstrated with a quadratic nonlinear nanophotonic resonator [46,47], and even g/\u03ba \u223c 10 may be envisioned with ultrafast pulses [48].\nIn the following, we first show that the pump field of a frequency-detuned OPA experiences conditional displacements depending on the number of signal Bogoliubov excitations N\u0302a, while N\u0302a is approximately preserved under the OPA dynamics. As a result, measuring the pump displacement allows one to perform a PNR QND measurement of N\u0302a. Next, we show that the nonlinear OPA dynamics can be utilized to perform a modular quadrature QND measurement [49,50] of the pump mode, with which we show a near-deterministic generation of the GKP states in the pump mode with only additional Gaussian resources, showing a nonlinear-optical route to universal fault-tolerant CV quantum information processing [15]. Finally, we bridge the physics of these QND schemes to a more traditional context by establishing analogies between a frequency-detuned optical parametric oscillator (OPO) and multilevel atom-cavity QED systems. We observe conditional localization of the intracavity state to the squeezed\nFock state ladder, which in experiments can be inferred from the pump homodyne record without monitoring the signal photon loss at all, using a quantum filter [51]."

We assume a non-negative frequency detuning between the signal and the pump \u03b4 \u2265 0 without loss of generality. It is worth noting that various photonic systems can be described by Eq. (1), including high-Q microring resonators [47], photonic crystal cavities [52,53], temporally trapped ultrashort pulses [48], and superconducting microwave circuits [54], and our results do not rely on a specific physical realization. For the derivation of the Hamiltonian, see Appendix A.\nTo treat the pump coherent amplitude (which may be large in many practical scenarios) in a parameterized way, we move to a displaced frame given by a unitary D\u0302b(\u03b2) = exp ( \u03b2b\u0302\u2020 \u2212 \u03b2\u2217b\u0302 ) , where the mean field of the pump mode\nis \u201cfactored out\u201d as\n|\u03c8(t)\u3009 = D\u0302b(\u03b2) |\u03d5(t)\u3009 , (2)\nwhere |\u03c8(t)\u3009 and |\u03d5(t)\u3009 are the system states in the laboratory frame and the displaced frame, respectively. We assume \u03b2 is real and positive without loss of generality. Physically, |\u03d5(t)\u3009 accounts for quantum fluctuations around the mean field, whose dynamics follow i\u2202t |\u03d5(t)\u3009 = H\u0302D |\u03d5(t)\u3009, where the Hamiltonian\nH\u0302D = D\u0302\u2020b(\u03b2)H\u0302 D\u0302b(\u03b2) = H\u0302NL + H\u0302Q (3)\nis composed of a cubic nonlinear term and a quadratic term\nH\u0302NL = g(a\u0302\u20202b\u0302 + a\u03022b\u0302\u2020), H\u0302Q = \u03b4a\u0302\u2020a\u0302 + r2 ( a\u0302\u20202 + a\u03022) ,\n(4)\nwith r = 2g\u03b2. From here on, we assume we are in the displaced frame unless specified otherwise.\nAn OPA is realized for an initial state |\u03d5(0)\u3009 = |\u03d5a(0)\u3009 |\u03d5b(0)\u3009 with |\u03d5b(0)\u3009 = |0\u3009, whose pump state is a coherent state with displacement \u03b2 in the laboratory frame. A conventional approach to analyze an OPA is to use an undepleted pump approximation, where the pump state remains invariant throughout the dynamics. As shown in\n010333-2\nRef. [55], this approximation is equivalent to ignoring H\u0302NL in H\u0302D, leading to single-mode squeezing of the signal state, which is the expected behavior of an OPA in the regime of Gaussian quantum optics [56].\nUnder stronger nonlinearity where the undepleted pump approximation breaks down, the contribution of the nonlinear term H\u0302NL induces non-Gaussian quantum features, e.g., signal-pump entanglement [55,57,58], for which we critically lack a qualitative physical description. In the following, as a main result of this work, we show a concise description of the nonlinear quantum behavior of a frequency-detuned OPA as a QND measurement of signal photons in the squeezed photon number basis. Our analysis adopts the Hamiltonian transformation recently introduced in Ref. [59].\nAssuming a relatively large frequency detuning \u03b4 > r, we can rewrite H\u0302Q as\nH\u0302Q = \u03b4a\u0302\u2020a\u0302 + r2 ( a\u0302\u20202 + a\u03022) = A\u0302\u2020A\u0302 + const, (5)\nwhere A\u0302 = a\u0302 cosh u + a\u0302\u2020 sinh u corresponds to the annihilation operator for Bogoliubov excitations, with =\u221a \u03b42 \u2212 r2 and u = tanh\u22121(r/\u03b4)/2. Intuitively, we can inter-\npret A\u0302 as an annihilation operator of a photon excitation in a squeezed photon number basis. The nonlinear Hamiltonian can then be rewritten in terms of the Bogoliubov operators as\nH\u0302NL = g { cosh2 u A\u0302\u20202 + sinh2 u A\u03022\n\u2212 sinh 2u (\nA\u0302\u2020A\u0302 + 1 2\n)} b\u0302 + H.c. (6)\nFor the rest of this work, we assume that the magnitude of H\u0302Q dominates over H\u0302NL, i.e., ge2u , which can always be achieved by appropriately choosing \u03b4 and r (i.e., \u03b2). Under these conditions, the contributions from the rapidly rotating terms containing A\u03022 and A\u0302\u20202 average out, allowing us to perform a rotating-wave approximation [59\u201361]. We thus have\nH\u0302D \u2248 \u22122g\u0303 ( N\u0302a + 12 ) x\u0302b + N\u0302a + const, (7)\nwhere N\u0302a = A\u0302\u2020A\u0302, x\u0302b = (b\u0302 + b\u0302\u2020)/2, and g\u0303 = g sinh 2u. In the Heisenberg picture, we analytically solve the operator dynamics under Eq. (7) as\nN\u0302a(t) \u2248 N\u0302a(0), p\u0302b(t) \u2248 g\u0303t ( N\u0302a(0)+ 12 ) + p\u0302b(0), (8)\nwhere p\u0302b = (b\u0302 \u2212 b\u0302\u2020)/2i is the p-quadrature operator of the pump mode. From Eq. (8), we note that the pump mode\np\u0302b experiences a displacement conditioned on the value of N\u0302a, leading to a specific signal-pump entanglement structure. Additionally, [H\u0302D, N\u0302a] \u2248 0 ensures that the value of N\u0302a is not disturbed during the system evolution. As a result, homodyne measurement of p\u0302b allows us to infer N\u0302a without performing a destructive measurement on the signal mode, thereby realizing a QND measurement of N\u0302a. Depending on the measurement result for p\u0302b, the signal state is projected onto an eigenstate of N\u0302a with eigenvalue Na, i.e., a squeezed photon-number state |Na\u3009 = 1/( \u221a Na!)A\u0302\u2020Na |0\u3009. This situation is summarized in Fig. 1. The performance of our PNR QND measurement depends on the measurement accuracy of p\u0302b, which is limited by the quadrature fluctuations of the probe pump state. Intuitively, the conditional displacement d = g\u0303t needs to be sufficiently large compared with the width of the p-\nquadrature fluctuations w = \u221a\n\u3008\u03d5b|p\u03022b |\u03d5b\u3009 \u2212 \u3008\u03d5b|p\u0302b|\u03d5b\u30092 to infer the value of N\u0302a with high confidence. In Fig. 1, we show the result of a full-quantum simulation of nonlinear OPA dynamics with an initial squeezed-vacuum pump state with w = 1/4. The final pump state exhibits multiple Gaussian peaks in the phase space separated by the distance d, each of which corresponds to a different number of signal Bogoliubov excitations N\u0302a. Because we have d/w = 4 (d = 1, w = 1/4) for the parameters used for Fig. 1, conditioning on the measurement result for p\u0302b projects the signal state to a squeezed photon-number state with fidelity that can exceed 90% with the assumed system parameters.\nTo establish more quantitative connections between the performance of the measurement and the squeezing of the probe-pump quadrature fluctuations, we provide the expressions for the Kraus operators of our QND measurement protocol. From Eq. (7), the Kraus operators can be expressed as\nM\u0302 (pb) = \u221e\u2211\nNa=0 CNa(pb) |Na\u3009 \u3008Na| , (9)\nwith CNa(pb) = e\u2212i Nat \u3008pb \u2212 d (Na + 1/2)|\u03d5b\u3009 being the complex probability amplitudes for the measurement outcomes, where |pb\u3009 is an eigenstate of p\u0302b with eigenvalue pb (see Appendix B for the full derivations). The Kraus operators are related to a positive-operator-valued measure (POVM) with elements\nF\u0302(pb) = M\u0302 \u2020(pb)M\u0302 (pb) = \u221e\u2211\nNa=0 |CNa(pb)|2 |Na\u3009 \u3008Na| . (10)\nPhysically, the outcome of a complete pump homodyne measurement pb follows a probability distribution P(pb) = \u3008\u03d5a|F\u0302(pb)|\u03d5a\u3009, and conditioned on the outcome pb, the postmeasurement signal state becomes \u2223\u2223\u03d5\u2032a(pb) \u232a = M\u0302 (pb) |\u03d5a(0)\u3009 up to normalization.\n010333-3\nIt is worth mentioning that the POVM (9) is not completely selective with respect to Na, because F\u0302(pb) is not solely composed of a single squeezed-Fock-state projector |Na\u3009 \u3008Na|. To characterize the mixedness of the POVM, it is insightful to consider its relative weights on the squeezed-Fock-state projectors\nWNa(pb) = |CNa(pb)|2\u2211\u221e\nN \u2032a=0 |CN \u2032a(pb)|2 , (11)\nwhich can be intuitively interpreted as the weights applied to |Na\u3009 conditioned on the homodyne outcome (see Appendix B for full discussions). In particular, WNa(pb) = 1 implies the postmeasurement state conditioned on the homodyne outcome pb is a pure squeezed Fock state |Na\u3009.\nIn Fig. 2(a), we show the purity of the POVM \u03b3 (F\u0302(pb)) = tr(F\u03022(pb))/tr(F\u0302(pb))2 [62] as a function of the homodyne measurement outcome pb, where we assume squeezed vacuum states with width w as the initial probe state. As can be seen from Fig. 2(a), using a probe state with smaller w increases the purity of the POVM for a given d, projecting the signal to a squeezed photonnumber state with higher fidelity. From an experimental perspective, squeezing the pump quadrature allows us to implement a PNR QND measurement with a shorter nonlinear interaction time and hence potentially lower propagation loss. In Fig. 2(b), we show the relative weights of\nsqueezed-Fock-state projectors WNa(pb), where we can see that the homodyne outcome of pb \u2248 d(Na + 1/2) dominantly projects the input state to |Na\u3009. Readers can also refer to Ref. [63] for general discussions on nonlinear amplifiers and quantum measurements that they can implement.\nIn contrast to the phase-insensitive photon-number tomography attainable by conventional PNR QND measurements [20\u201322], our scheme can perform PNR QND measurement in an arbitrary squeezed photon number basis, enabling phase-sensitive squeeze tomography [64, 65], from which we can obtain phase information about the state under tomographic reconstruction. Here, introducing a complex phase to the pump displacement \u03b2 changes the rotation angle of the basis, while the ratio r/\u03b4 determines the squeezing factor. The measurement basis gets more squeezed for r/\u03b4 \u2192 1, where we can have a larger enhancement factor of nonlinear coupling g\u0303/g. In the other limit of r/\u03b4 \u2192 0, the measurement basis converges to the (nonsqueezed) photon-number state basis, which comes with a cost of vanishing effective nonlinear coupling g\u0303/g \u2192 0. It is worth mentioning that additional Gaussian operations can enable flexible control over the measurement basis without compromising the nonlinear coupling. For this purpose, we can apply a pair of opposite squeezing operations S\u0302a and S\u0302 \u2020 a to the signal state before and after evolving under H\u0302D, respectively, which transforms the\n010333-4\nmeasurement basis so that N\u0302eff = A\u0302\u2020effA\u0302eff is measured with A\u0302eff = S\u0302\u2020aA\u0302S\u0302a [66]. By choosing S\u0302a such that A\u0302eff = a\u0302, we realize a QND measurement of the normal photon number n\u0302a = a\u0302\u2020a\u0302 without resorting to the limit of r/\u03b4 \u2192 0. Such a pair of squeezing and antisqueezing operations was experimentally demonstrated on pulsed nonlinear nanophotonics as reported in Ref. [67].

            "text": "While our focus so far has been on QND measurement of the signal excitations, we now show that one can also perform a QND measurement of the pump field quadratures using the same physics of the nonlinear OPA dynamics. For this, we use the operator dynamics under Eq. (7) as\nx\u0302b(t) = x\u0302b(0), A\u0302(t) = ei(2g\u0303tx\u0302b(0)\u2212 t)A\u0302(0), (12)\nwhere the information about 2g\u0303tx\u0302b \u2212 t is encoded in the phase of A\u0302 up to the modulus of 2\u03c0 . Therefore, the measured phase of A\u0302, e.g., with a general-dyne measurement [68\u201370], indirectly infers the value of x\u0302b modulo \u03bc = \u03c0/g\u0303t, which projects the pump mode to x\u0302b = x\u03c6 (mod \u03bc)\nfor a phase measurement outcome of \u03c6, where we denote x\u03c6 = (\u03c6 + t)/2g\u0303t (mod \u03bc). The pump quadrature x\u0302b itself remains constant throughout the dynamics due to [x\u0302b, H\u0302D] \u2248 0, which ensures the QND nature of the measurement. Such modular quadrature measurements play central roles in contemporary CV quantum information processing, e.g., for deterministic generation, stabilization, and quantum error correction with GKP states [14,49,50]. In the following, we demonstrate a preparation of an approximate GKP state using the nonlinear dynamics of an OPA, where only additional Gaussian resources (i.e., Gaussian initial states, measurements, and feedforward operations) are used. Our proposal for generating GKP states adapts the protocols introduced in Refs. [14,49], with crucial technical differences stemming from the nonlinear dynamics of frequency-detuned OPAs.\nFor the following discussions, we denote a coherent excitation of the Bogoliubov signal mode as |A\u3009. Physically, |A\u3009 is a displaced squeezed state and is an eigenstate of the operator A\u0302 with eigenvalue A. As shown in Fig. 3, we prepare the initial signal state |A0\u3009 with A0 > 0 as a \u201cmeter\u201d state for the phase shift. For the initial pump state, we assume a p-squeezed vacuum with width w/4 along the p quadrature.\nAfter propagation through a nonlinear OPA for time t, we perform a phase measurement on A\u0302 by a complete general-dyne measurement [68], which projects the signal mode on the measurement basis of displaced squeezed states {\u2223\u2223ei\u03c6(A0 + )\n\u232a}. Here, the measurement basis is parameterized by the radius (A0 + ) \u2265 0 and the phase \u03c6 (see Appendix F for full details on the construction of a general-dyne measurement). The performance of the phase measurement can be further improved by adaptive measurement schemes [69,70]. For the preparation of a GKP state, a modular quadrature measurement with modulus \u03bc = \u221a2\u03c0 is desired, which sets the interaction time g\u0303t = \u221a\u03c0/2.\nWhen the magnitude of the meter state A0 is much larger than the vacuum noise level, the measurement outcome is expected to be exponentially localized around | | A0. Assuming this condition is met, the postmeasurement pump state becomes\n\u2223\u2223\u03d5\u2032b \u232a \u2248 D\u0302b(x\u03c6)D\u0302b ( i \u221a \u03c0/2 A0 2 ) \u2223\u2223\u22230\u0303 \u232a , (13)\nwhich can be transformed to an approximate GKP logical state\n\u2223\u2223\u22230\u0303 \u232a \u221d \u221e\u2211 n=\u2212\u221e e\u2212 w2(n \u221a 2\u03c0+x\u03c6)2 4 D\u0302b(n \u221a 2\u03c0) |\u03ba\u3009 (14)\nvia trivial displacement operations (see Appendix C for more details). Here, \u00b7 is a floor function, and |\u03ba\u3009 is an x-squeezed vacuum with width \u03ba = \u221a \u3008x\u03022b\u3009 \u2212 \u3008x\u0302b\u30092 =\n010333-5\n1/2 \u221a \u03c0A0 along the x quadrature. It is worth mentioning that this GKP generation scheme is nearly deterministic, because an extra displacement D\u0302b(x\u0302\u03c6) induced by the probabilistic phase readout \u03c6 can be largely compensated by the trivial feedforward displacement operations. The resultant GKP state becomes symmetric when w = \u03ba holds true, corresponding to A0 = 1/2\u221a\u03c0w.\nIn Fig. 3, we show the results of our numerical simulations showing the generation of a symmetric GKP state with a squeezing level of 15 dB (beyond the error correction threshold of approximately 10 dB [71,72]). Compared with existing nonlinear-optical GKP state generation schemes using cross-phase modulation [43,44], our approach uses much stronger quadratic nonlinearities, which may offer more viable prospects for non-Gaussian state engineering at room temperature.\nIt is important to note that, in addition to the GKP logical states, we need nontrivial superpositions of them, e.g., GKP magic states [15,73,74], to realize universal quantum computation. Since our scheme cannot directly generate GKP magic states from Gaussian resources, this important challenge of realizing a universal gate set for GKP codes has to be addressed separately. To this end, Baragiola et al. [15] showed that generation of GKP magic states is possible with only additional Gaussian resources, provided we have access to a supply of GKP logical states, for which our scheme can serve as an efficient source. This means that a nonlinear OPA is, in principle, a sufficient resource to realize universal nonlinear-optical quantum computation with additional all-Gaussian resources."

            "text": "An important application of parametric interactions is an OPO, which is realized by pumping a quadratic nonlinear resonator with an external drive field. In the absence of signal loss, a resonant OPO with zero frequency detuning \u03b4 = 0 has two transient states, i.e., odd and even signal cat states comprising the quantum superposition of \u03c0 -phaseshifted coherent states. The presence of a finite signal loss leads to spontaneous switching of the parity of the cat states, devolving the cat states into incoherent mixtures of the original coherent states [75,76], which is reminiscent of the spontaneous quantum jumps observed in a twolevel atom-cavity QED system [77]. Here, we show that a frequency-detuned OPO exhibits behavior reminiscent of multilevel atom-cavity QED, where the signal photon loss induces quantum jumps among the signal states in the squeezed Fock state ladder.\nWe introduce an external pump drive for an OPO given by the Hamiltonian term H\u0302drive = i\u03bb(b\u0302\u2020 \u2212 b\u0302), and the outcoupling pump loss is characterized by the Lindblad operator L\u0302b = \u221a\u03bab(b\u0302 + \u03b2) (in the laboratory frame L\u0302b = \u221a\u03babb\u0302). In the absence of signal loss, the pump operator dynamics follow\ni\u2202tb\u0302 = \u2212g\u0303 ( N\u0302a + 12 ) \u2212 i\u03bab 2 (b\u0302 + \u03b2)+ i\u03bb, (15)\nwhile N\u0302a remains constant. For a choice of \u03bb = \u03bab\u03b2/2, we have stationary states |Na\u3009 \u2223\u2223\u03b2Na \u232a for Na \u2208 Z+, where\n010333-6\n\u2223\u2223\u03b2Na \u232a\nis a coherent pump state with displacement \u03b2Na = 2i\u03ba\u22121b g\u0303(Na + 1/2). Since \u03b2Na depends on Na, the pump photons leaving the OPO carry out information about Na, which plays the role of a weak continuous QND measurement of N\u0302a. Thus, by our monitoring the outcoupled pump field, the system (pump-signal) state is expected to conditionally collapse to one of the stationary states |Na\u3009 \u2223\u2223\u03b2Na \u232a .\nLet us now consider the effects of a finite signal loss. When a signal photon is lost from \u2223\u2223\u03b2Na \u232a , the intracavity signal state experiences a quantum jump as |Na\u3009 \u2192 a\u0302 |Na\u3009, resulting in the signal mode given as\ncosh u \u221a Na |Na \u2212 1\u3009 \u2212 sinh u \u221a Na + 1 |Na + 1\u3009 . (16)\nThis implies that a loss of a signal photon, corresponding to a photon subtraction from a squeezed photon-number state, induces a discrete jump of the Bogoliubov excitation Na \u2192 Na \u00b1 1, both in the positive direction and in the negative direction. Note that the flow is biased toward the negative direction because cosh u > sinh u.\nBecause of the quantum correlations between N\u0302a and p\u0302b, the occurrence of such a quantum jump can be inferred from the record on the pump homodyne measurement without the signal loss photons being monitored at all. To emulate this situation, we perform numerical simulations of a stochastic master equation [51] unraveled\nby a pump p-homodyne measurement, while we do not monitor signal loss photons. As shown in Fig. 4(a), we observe correlated spontaneous jumps in \u3008N\u0302a\u3009 and \u3008p\u0302b\u3009 showing multilevel plateaus corresponding to the production of squeezed photon-number states, which can be inferred solely from the pump homodyne record [77,78]. Such discrete behaviors emerging from a continuousvariable system under the monitoring of only continuous observables are illuminating manifestations of the intrinsic quantum nature of photons. When the system is found in |Na = 0\u3009 \u2223\u2223\u03b2Na=0 \u232a , the signal state is in a squeezed vacuum, whose squeezing level can conditionally exceed the \u22123-dB limit of an OPO intracavity steady-state squeezing [79] [see Fig. 4(b)]. Note that this phenomenon exhibiting strong signal squeezing is distinct from the physics unraveled in Ref. [59], where more than 3 dB of squeezing is realized in the pump mode of an OPO."

            "text": "In this work, we propose and analyze a scheme for PNR QND measurement and quantum state engineering using the nonlinear quantum behavior of an OPA. We first show that the pump mode driving a frequency-detuned OPA experiences conditional displacements depending on the number of signal Bogoliubov excitations N\u0302a, enabling one to measure N\u0302a nondestructively via a pump homodyne detection. Such PNR QND measurements allow highefficiency ultrafast PNR measurements (replacing the use of conventional slow superconducting detectors) and a deterministic implementation of a photon-photon entangling gate [26,27], providing all the necessary elements for deterministic room-temperature DV photonic quantum computation at ultrafast clock rates.\nWe then show that the nonlinear OPA dynamics can be utilized to realize a modular quadrature QND measurement of the pump mode via a signal phase measurement, which naturally provides a way to deterministically generate optical GKP logical states with additional allGaussian resources. Combined with the all-Gaussian GKP magic state distillation protocol from GKP logical states [15], our results may unlock promising opportunities for room-temperature ultrafast universal quantum computation with GKP states in CV architectures. It is worth mentioning that our GKP state generation protocol uses Gaussian quadrature measurements, which can be purified using recently demonstrated amplification techniques with high-gain linear OPAs before the inefficient general-dyne measurements, thereby offering a way to generate highly pure GKP states [67,80,81]. Finally, extending the discussions to OPO physics, we show that continuous homodyne monitoring of the outcoupled pump field leads to conditional localization of the signal mode on squeezed photonnumber states, thereby highlighting a unique opportunity to synthesize and characterize the intracavity nonclassical states in real time.\nOur scheme does not rely on materials with cubic nonlinearity, and thus provides a clear path for overcoming the long-standing challenge of nonlinear-optical PNR QND schemes based on cross-phase modulation, where the selfphase modulation that inevitably accompanies cross-phase modulation leads to phase noise that is detrimental to the probe field [20\u201323,82]. Our work establishes a concise description of the nonlinear-optical parametric interactions beyond the conventional semiclassical picture, thereby showing a practical path toward large-scale, ultrafast, and fault-tolerant universal photonic quantum information processors at room temperature."

This projects the signal state on a measurement basis spanned by states {\u2223\u2223ei\u03c6(A0 + )\n\u232a}, where a displaced squeezed state \u2223\u2223ei\u03c6(A0 + ) \u232a is parameterized by the radius A0 + \u2265 0 and the phase \u03c6. The details for the construction of a general-dyne measurement are provided in Appendix F.\nFor a given measurement outcome of and \u03c6, the postmeasurement pump state becomes\n\u2223\u2223\u03d5\u2032b \u232a = \u2329ei\u03c6(A0 + ) \u2223\u2223 e\u2212iH\u0302Dt |A0\u3009 |\u03d5b(0)\u3009\n= \u222b dxb \u2329 A0 + \u2223\u2223\u2223ei(2g\u0303txb\u2212 t\u2212\u03c6)A0 \u232a \u03d5b(xb) |xb\u3009 (C2)\nup to normalization.

When we use a \u201cmeter\u201d signal state with an amplitude much greater than the noise level of a vacuum, the outcome of the signal measurement is expected to be exponentially localized around | | A0. Assuming that this condition is\n010333-9\nmet, we can approximate Eq. (C4) as\nCxb( ,\u03c6) \u2248 \u221e\u2211\nn=\u2212\u221e exp\n{\u22122A20(g\u0303t)2(xb \u2212 xn \u2212 x\u03c6)2 }\n\u00d7 exp {2iA20g\u0303t(xb \u2212 xn \u2212 x\u03c6) } , (C5)\nwhere xn = n\u03bc and x\u03c6 = ( t + \u03c6)/2g\u0303t (mod \u03bc), with \u03bc = \u03c0/g\u0303t. Notice that Eq. (C5) exhibits multiple Gaussian peaks with width \u03ba = 1/2\u221a\u03c0A0 separated by an equal distance \u03bc.\nFor the generation of a GKP state, we specifically consider a p-squeezed pump state\n\u03d5b(xb) = w 1/2\n(2\u03c0)1/4 e\u2212\nw2x2b 4 , (C6)\nwhose width along the p quadrature is w/4.

In the presence of dissipation, the density matrix for the system state follows the master equation\nd\u03c1\u0302 dt\n= \u2212i[H\u0302 , \u03c1\u0302] + \u2211\nj \u2208{a,b}\n( L\u0302\u2020j \u03c1\u0302L\u0302j \u2212\n1 2 {\u03c1\u0302, L\u0302\u2020j L\u0302j }\n) , (D1)\nwhere {O\u03021, O\u03022} = O\u03021O\u03022 + O\u03022O\u03021 is an anticommutator. In the main text, we assumed the dynamical timescale of the phase rotation of the Bogoliubov excitation dominates over the nonlinear coupling rate, i.e., g. Here we further assume that dominates over the timescale of dissipation as well, i.e., \u03baa, \u03bab. When this assumption holds, by virtue of the rotating-wave approximation, we are justified to ignore contributions from the rapidly rotating terms terms containing A\u03022 and A\u0302\u20202 in Eq. (D1). Specifically, for the terms describing signal loss, we have\nL\u0302\u2020a\u03c1\u0302L\u0302a \u2212 1 2 {\u03c1\u0302, L\u0302\u2020aL\u0302a} \u2248 \u2211 j \u2208{+,\u2212} L\u0302\u2020j \u03c1\u0302L\u0302j \u2212 1 2 {\u03c1\u0302, L\u0302\u2020j L\u0302j },\n(D2)\nwith L\u0302+ = \u221a\u03baa sinh(u)A\u0302\u2020 and L\u0302\u2212 = \u221a\u03baa cosh(u)A\u0302\u2020. This result indicates that, under a rotating-wave approximation, we can decompose the effect of the original signal Lindblad operator L\u0302a = \u221a\u03baaa\u0302 into that of two Lindblad operators L\u0302+ and L\u0302\u2212.\nIn the following discussions, for concreteness, we consider a squeezed single-photon state |Na = 1\u3009 as an initial signal state. For the initial pump state, we assume a psqueezed vacuum with width w along the p quadrature. For a successful PNR QND measurement, the probability for a quantum jump to occur in the signal mode should be sufficiently low. In the low-loss limit, the probability for a\n010333-10\nquantum jump is approximately given as\nPjump = 1 \u2212 \u3008Na = 1|e\u2212L\u0302 \u2020 aL\u0302at|Na = 1\u3009\n\u2248 1 \u2212 \u3008Na = 1|e\u2212(L\u0302 \u2020 +L\u0302++L\u0302\u2020\u2212L\u0302\u2212)t|Na = 1\u3009\n= 1 \u2212 \u3008Na = 1|e\u2212\u03baa(cosh(2u)N\u0302a+sinh2(u))t|Na = 1\u3009 = 1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03baa(3 cosh2(u)\u22122)t, (D3)\nwhich sets a characteristic timescale for the loss-induced quantum jump as tjump \u223c 1/ cosh2(u)\u03baa.\nTo be able to measure N\u0302a with high confidence, the conditional displacement occurring over the timescale of tjump needs to be greater than the characteristic width of the pump state. In the presence of finite but small pump loss, the width of the final pump state along the p quadrature becomes\nw\u2032(t) = \u221a\nw2e\u2212\u03babt + (1 \u2212 e\u2212\u03babt)/4 \u2248 \u221a w2 + (1/4 \u2212 w2)\u03babt, (D4)\nwhere we have assumed \u03babt 1. As a result, the experimental condition for a successful implementation of our scheme becomes g\u0303tjump w\u2032(tjump). We use the squiggly symbol to denote approximate equality up to factors of order of unity.\nWe assume strong squeezing for all the fields involved, i.e., signal Bogoliubov excitation and the pump state. Also, we assume a similar level of loss and squeezing for both the signal and the pump, i.e., \u03baa \u223c \u03bab and w \u223c e\u2212u 1. Under these conditions, the order of magnitude of w\u2032(tjump) is larger than w by only a factor of unity, allowing us to approximate w\u2032(tjump) \u223c w. As a result, we obtain a concise expression for the experimental requirement for our scheme as\ng \u03baa\nw. (D5)"

            "heading": "APPENDIX E: LOSS ANALYSIS FOR EXTERNAL SQUEEZERS",
            "text": "In the main text, we comment on the possible extension of the PNR QND measurement scheme using external squeezing operations to modify the measurement basis. As illustrated in Fig. 5, we consider applying a pair of opposite squeezing operations S\u0302a and S\u0302 \u2020 a to the signal state before and after the frequency-detuned OPA. In this construction, the frequency-detuned OPA implements a QND measurement of the squeezed photon number N\u0302a, and the external squeezing operations modify the overall measured observable to N\u0302eff = S\u0302\u2020aN\u0302aS\u0302a, providing a flexible control to the measurement basis. A particular scenario of interest is when S\u0302a is chosen such that N\u0302eff = n\u0302a holds, which\nrealizes a QND measurement of normal photon number as a whole. For an experimental implementation of such extended PNR QND measurements, the loss associated with the squeezers can induce measurement errors. In the following, we analyze the effects of squeezer-induced loss on the extended QND measurement for the case N\u0302eff = n\u0302a.\nTo separately analyze the effects of squeezer-induced loss from the effects of other possible imperfections, we assume ideal dynamics with no decoherence for the frequency-detuned OPA. We model a lossy squeezer with a total loss of L as a combination of an ideal squeezer and two beam splitters with equal transmissivity T2 = \u221a1 \u2212 L placed before and after the squeezer. We denote the losses of the first and second squeezers as L1 and L2, respectively (see Fig. 5). For concreteness, we consider an input single-photon Fock state |1\u3009 = a\u0302\u2020 |0\u3009.\nIn the absence of loss, the state after the first squeezer is a pure state S\u0302a |1\u3009, while nonzero loss makes the output of the first squeezer a mixed state described by a density matrix \u03c1\u03021. Then, the error induced by the squeezer loss can be characterized by the infidelity\nE1 = 1 \u2212 \u30081| S\u0302\u2020a \u03c1\u03021S\u0302a |1\u3009 , (E1)\nwhich can be interpreted as the probability of finding states other than the expected state S\u0302a |1\u3009 at the output of the first squeezer. In Fig. 6(a), we show E1 as a function of the loss L1 for various squeezing levels of S\u0302a. We note that the power gain required for the external squeezers G to realize N\u0302eff = n\u0302a is determined solely by the ratio g\u0303/g = sinh(2u) via G = e2u.\nTo analyze the effects of the second squeezer\u2019s loss separately from the effects of the first squeezer\u2019s loss, we assume L1 = 0 for the following discussions. Since we also assume an ideal frequency-detuned OPA Hamiltonian, which commutes with N\u0302a, the input to the second squeezer is S\u0302a |1\u3009. In the absence of loss, the output of the second squeezer should be a single-photon state |1\u3009, while nonzero loss leads to a mixed output state described by a density matrix \u03c1\u03022. We can then quantify the error induced by the\n010333-11\nloss of the second squeezer using the infidelity\nE2 = 1 \u2212 \u30081| \u03c1\u03022 |1\u3009 , (E2) which we show as a function of L2 in Fig. 6(b). Again, E2 can be interpreted as the probability of finding states other than the expected output state |1\u3009 at the end of the overall measurement protocol. We note that E1 and E2 exhibit similar but different values for the same level of squeezing and loss."

Physically, a general-dyne measurement is a projection of a target state to a displaced squeezed state\n\u2223\u2223\u03c6\u03be (x + ip) \u232a = D\u0302(x + ip)S\u0302(\u03be) |0\u3009 , (F1)\nwhere D\u0302(\u03b1) is a displacement operator and S\u0302(\u03be) is a squeezing operator with a field gain \u03be along the x quadrature. The POVM for the general-dyne measurement is given as\nF\u0302\u03be (x, p) = 1 \u03c0 |\u03c6\u03be (x + ip)\u3009\u3008\u03c6\u03be (x + ip)|. (F2)\nNotice that the measurement basis becomes a coherentstate basis and an infinitely-squeezed-state basis for \u03be = 1 and \u03be = \u00b1\u221e, respectively, and thus the notion of general-dyne measurement contains canonical heterodyne and homodyne measurements as special cases.\nWe illustrate our construction of a general-dyne measurement in Fig. 7, which we explain in detail below. First, we mix an input state |\u03d5\u30091 in mode 1 with a vacuum state |0\u30092 in mode 2 with a beam splitter, and the state after the beam splitter becomes\n|\u03d5BS\u300912 = U\u0302BS |\u03d5\u30091 |0\u30092 .

The beam splitter unitary is characterized by the operator transformations [84]\nU\u0302\u2020BSa\u03021U\u0302BS = cos \u03b8 a\u03021 \u2212 sin \u03b8 a\u03022, (F5) U\u0302\u2020BSa\u03022U\u0302BS = sin \u03b8 a\u03021 + cos \u03b8 a\u03022. (F6)\nWe then perform x-quadrature and p-quadrature homodyne measurements on mode 1 and mode 2, respectively, yielding measurement outcomes x\u03021 = x1 and p\u03022 = p2. As a result, the post-beam-splitter state |\u03d5BS\u300912 is projected onto the measurement basis {|x1\u30091 |p2\u30092}, and this projection takes the form\n\u3008x1|1 \u3008p2|2 |\u03d5BS\u300912 = \u3008\u03c6(x1, p2)|\u03d5\u30091 .

In the final line, we have excluded the subscripts for the mode index for brevity. Here, ei\u03bd is a known phase factor, \u03be = tan \u03b8 , and\nx = sec \u03b8 x1, p = csc \u03b8 p2. (F10)\nAs a result, if we apply an appropriate normalization, the POVM for the entire measurement protocol becomes Eq. (F2), implying that we have successfully constructed a general-dyne measurement. The level of squeezing \u03be = tan \u03b8 can be set to any real value via the choice of the beam splitter transmissivity T = cos2 \u03b8 . For \u03b8 = 0,\u03c0/2, the overall measurement becomes a homodyne measurement, while for \u03b8 = \u03c0/4, the measurement becomes a heterodyne measurement.\nTo implement the phase measurement of A\u0302 as discussed in Sec. III, we set the transmissivity of the beam splitter so that tan \u03b8 = e\u2212r holds. Then, on the basis of the homodyne measurement outcomes x1 and p2, the state is projected to a desired measurement basis spanned by the displaced squeezed states |A\u3009 = |\u03c6\u03be (x + ip)\u3009, with A = x + ip .\n[1] M.
