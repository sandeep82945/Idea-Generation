    "abstractText": "Prior studies of A:B::C:D verbal analogies have identified several factors that affect performance, including the semantic similarity between source and target domains (semantic distance), the semantic association between the C-term and incorrect answers (distracter salience), and the type of relations between word pairs. However, it is unclear how these stimulus properties affect performance when utilized together. To test their interactive effects, we created a verbal analogy stimulus set that factorially crossed these factors and presented participants with an analogical stem (A:B::C:?) with two response choices: an analogically correct (D) and incorrect distracter (D\u2032) term. The semantic distance between source and target word pairs was manipulated creating near (bowl:dish::spoon:silverware) and far (wrench:tool::sad:mood) analogies. The salience of an incorrect distracter (D\u2032) was manipulated using the sematic distance with the C-term creating low (drawer) and high (fork) salience distracters. Causal, compositional, and categorical relations were presented across these conditions. Accuracies were higher for semantically near than far analogies and when distracter salience was low than high. Categorical relations yielded better performance than the causal and compositional relations. Moreover, a three-way interaction demonstrated that the effects of semantic distance and distracter salience had a greater impact on performance for compositional and causal relations than for the categorical ones. We theorize that causal and compositional analogies, given their less semantically constrained responses, require more inhibitory control than more constraining relations (e.g., categorical).",

Solving such analogies entails several component processes (Sternberg, 1977; Sternberg & Nigro, 1980) including (1) relational inference from the\nsource (A:B pair), (2) mapping between the corresponding elements of the pairs (A to C-term; B to D-term); (3) transfer of the inferred relation from the first pair onto the second (C:D) pair, and (4) response selection. Item factors such as word familiarity, semantic distance, and source-pair relation influence the difficulty of one or more of these processes and in turn the performance on an analogical task (Ichien et\u00a0al., 2020). Within analogy, semantic distance represents the extent to which analogy terms differ in their underlying domains with \u201cnear\u201d analogies having similar domains (squirrel:rodent::robin:bird) and \u201cfar\u201d analogies having different domains (wrench:tool::sad:mood), with better performance for near than far analogies. Likewise, the number of distracting choices presented alongside the correct D-term, and/or greater semantic similarity between the distracter(s) and the C-term, can also impact performance (Morrison et\u00a0al., 2004; Thibaut et\u00a0al., 2010). Here we focus on \u201cdistracter salience\u201d defined as the semantic distance between the C-term (robin) with the analogically correct D-term (bird) compared with the incorrect D\u2032-terms (nest * Lara L.

As described herein, both semantic distance and distracter salience affect performance via the mapping and response selection processes.\nSpecific analogical relations, such as robin is a kind of bird, may also impact performance (Ichien et\u00a0al., 2020; Sternberg & Nigro, 1980). However, performance-related effects of semantic distance and distractor salience across different analogical relations has not been sufficiently investigated. A carefully controlled experiment is needed to examine whether (1) particular relations better facilitate the mapping and response selection processes over other relations and (2) the effects of semantic distance and distracter salience differ across relations. Hence, the purpose of our study was to investigate the separate and combined effects of all three factors\u2014semantic distance, distracter salience, and relation type\u2014on accuracies in a verbal analogy selection task. We discuss each of these factors in turn."

            "text": "Broadly, semantic distance refers to the path in a semantic network between nodes (Kumar et\u00a0al., 2020). We adopt the definition commonly used within the context of verbal analogy, of semantic distance reflecting the similarity between the domains represented in the source and target word pairs (Green et\u00a0al., 2006). For example, the pairs in the semantically near or same-domain analogy, bowl:dish::spoon:silverware, both entail kitchen utensils, whereas in the far or between-domain analogy, wrench : tool :: sad : mood, the source and target pairs are from different contexts. The greater similarity of domains in the near analogies facilitates one-to-one mapping (i.e., alignment of the corresponding A-C and B-D-terms). This process is known as structural alignment in the structure\nmapping theory (Gentner & Maravilla, 2018), and it is a fundamental part of the overall mapping process (see Gentner & Forbus, 2011, Table\u00a0 1). That is, mapping between aligned terms in semantically near pairs (bowl and spoon) can be based on both semantic and structural similarity. In contrast, far analogies require more abstraction in the form of a greater reliance on structural similarity given the absence of semantic similarity (Green et\u00a0al., 2014; Holyoak, 2012). Indeed, this greater semantic similarity between the corresponding terms in near analogies facilitates the structural alignment (Gentner, 1983; Gentner & Forbus, 2011; Gentner & Maravilla, 2018; Gentner & Smith, 2012; Hoyos & Gentner, 2017).\nNear semantic distances are also a facilitative factor in projection-first models, which as demonstrated in many eye-tracking studies (Glady et\u00a0al., 2016; Gordon & Moser, 2007; Thibaut & French, 2016; Thibaut, French, Missault, et\u00a0al., 2011a; Vendetti et\u00a0al., 2017), entail an initial focus on the A:B pair followed by more attention to the C-term and possible target pairs. In near analogies (e.g., bowl:dish::spoon:silverware), the initial focus on the A:B pair would also activate any semantic or thematic information (e.g., kitchen or eating domain) in addition to the categorical relation. The relation and domain information would then be projected onto the C-term, which shares the same domain, to aid in the selection of the most suitable D-term.\nAcross a variety of verbal analogical tasks, performance was better for analogies having near than far semantic distance (Bunge et\u00a0al., 2005; Green, 2016; Green et\u00a0al., 2010, 2012; Green et\u00a0 al., 2014; Jones & Estes, 2015; Kmiecik et\u00a0al., 2019; Vendetti et\u00a0al., 2012; Vendetti et\u00a0al., 2014; Weinberger et\u00a0al., 2016). For example, in an analogical selection task that required participants to choose a response from five choices, response times (RTs) and accuracies were better for near than far analogies (Jones & Estes, 2015). These findings support the hypothesis that\nTable 1 Example items\nNote.

Therefore, we predict a robust effect of semantic distance with higher accuracies for the semantically near than far analogies."

            "text": "Distracter salience refers to the relative semantic distance between the C-term and each answer option: the analogically correct D and incorrect distracter (D\u2032) terms.1 Distractor salience is high when the C-term of the analogy is semantically nearer to the distracter than the correct analogical answer. In leather : saddle :: gold : earring, the C-term, gold, has a greater semantic similarity with the high salience distracter (silver) than with the correct answer (earring), but a lower semantic similarity with the low salience distracter (aluminum) in comparison to the correct answer. Distracter salience is particularly relevant to the response selection component process in analogical selection tasks and may derail the mapping process. That is, one may have successfully mapped the A and C terms (e.g., leather and gold) based on their relational roles as materials of their respective objects. Then gold would be mapped onto the to-be-selected D-term\u2014an object that can be made of gold. However, in the process of selecting that D-term, the greater association between the C-term with a high salience distracter option (silver) may cause one to select this relationally inconsistent distracter rather than to complete the alignment of the B and D-terms. This derailment of the alignment is even more likely for those with less inhibitory control over salient responses, such as adults with frontal lobe injuries/disease (Krawczyk et\u00a0al., 2008; Morrison et\u00a0al., 2004) and children (Richland et\u00a0al., 2006; Thibaut & French, 2016; Thibaut et\u00a0al., 2010; Thibaut, French, Missault, et\u00a0al., 2011a; Thibaut, French, Vezneva, et\u00a0al., 2011b), and can also occur in young adults (Bugaiska & Thibaut, 2015).\nIn addition to predicting a main effect of distracter salience as found in prior studies (e.g., Bugaiska & Thibaut, 2015), we also predict an interaction with semantic distance. Given that mapping in near analogies is facilitated by both featural and relational/structural similarity, high distractor salience is more likely to impair performance on semantically far analogies given their reliance on relational roles\n(Gentner et\u00a0al., 1993; Gentner & Kurtz, 2006; Rattermann & Gentner, 1998). Moreover, the type of analogical relation and its interaction with semantic distance and distracter salience may further impact performance."

Some relations, like opposites (e.g., up:down) and exemplar-category \u201csuperordinate\u201d relations (e.g., hammer:tool) yield better performance in comparison to other types of relations (e.g., category co-members: wrench:hammer; Jones, 2011; Sternberg & Nigro, 1980). In Kmiecik et\u00a0al. (2019), participants demonstrated better performance verifying analogies composed of categorical relations (\u201ckind of\u201d; hammer:tool::silver :metal) compared with compositional relations (\u201cmade of\u201d; tire:rubber::chain:link).2 One reason for the better performance on categorical relations is that they are spontaneously activated during analogy as claimed by the micro-category account of analogy (Green et\u00a0al., 2008) and are more accessible than other types of semantic relations (Schumacher et\u00a0al., 2009). The automatic activation of the categorical relation may facilitate the mapping process in the far categorical analogies (wrench: tool::sad:mood) by increasing the structural similarity between corresponding terms (i.e., both A and C as exemplars; both B and D as categories). Moreover, the constraint of the B-terms and D-terms as category labels may even pre-activate the correct D-term (e.g., mood) prior to presentation of the response options. Indeed, based on the complementary role activation model (Mather et\u00a0al., 2014), the greater the degree of semantic constraint provided by the relational roles (A-term as category exemplar; B as the category), the faster the judgment. In contrast, causal and compositional relations provide less constraint on the possible B-terms and D-terms. For instance, leather could be a material used in many different objects (gloves, jacket, etc.). Likewise, in the causal analogy, allergy:sneeze::entertainmen t:laughter, the cause entertainment could produce other possible effects (joy, fun, relaxation, etc.). Therefore, we predict that performance will be better for these categorical analogies than for the causal or compositional analogies. Based on the micro-category account as well as the facilitative role of semantic constraint in the mapping and response selection processes, we further predict that far\n1 This differs somewhat from others\u2019 investigation of the analogy\u2019s association strength (e.g., Thibaut & French, 2016), which varies the association strength between both the A:B pairs and C:D pairs.

            "text": "Analogical pairs and analogies were sampled from prior studies on conceptual combination (Estes, 2003; Estes & Jones, 2006; Fenker et\u00a0al., 2005; Jones et\u00a0al., 2008) and analogy (Jones, 2011; Jones & Estes, 2015; Kmiecik et\u00a0al., 2019). We then created a set of 60 analogies using these items consisting of 30 analogies that were semantically near and 30 that were semantically far based on Latent Semantic Analysis (LSA; Landauer et\u00a0al., 1998; http:// lsa. color ado. edu) based semantic distance as described below (see Table\u00a01). The entire set of 60 analogies are shown with all the following measures in the Supplemental Materials\u2014Spreadsheet of Analogies (https:// osf. io/ cd7b9).\nSemantic distance As done in prior analogy studies (e.g., Green et\u00a0 al., 2010, 2012; Green et\u00a0 al., 2015; Jones & Estes, 2015; Kmiecik et\u00a0al., 2019), we measured semantic distance using LSA, which is based on textual cooccurrence, to quantify semantic distance between the source and target word pairs. Semantic distance was calculated by subtracting the LSA cosine from 1 to produce a semantic distance score (Green et\u00a0al., 2015), with higher scores indicating far semantic distances. Within each relation, pairs were grouped such that for the near analogies the A:B and C:D pairs had items from the same or similar domains and LSA semantic distance scores of .70 or below (e.g., bakery foods; oatmeal:cookie::banana:muffin), with the exception of one item, feather:pillow::foam:cushion, that had a semantic distance of .80. The far analogies were formed with pairs from different domains, speeding:ticket::run:exhausted, and had LSA semantic\ndistance scores of .90 or above with the exception of one causal analogy, speeding:ticket::run:exhausted, that had a semantic distance score of .71, most likely due to the cooccurrence of speeding and run. Thus, the near and far analogies were nonoverlapping on semantic distance except for those items. An independent-samples t test confirmed that the LSA-based semantic distance scores were greater for the semantically far A:B\u2013C:D pairs (M = .96, SD = .06) than for the semantically near A:B\u2013C:D pairs (M = .52, SD = .15), t(58) = 15.46, p < .001, Cohen\u2019s d = 3.85.\nHowever, the use of only LSA cosines to estimate semantic similarity is problematic (Beaty & Johnson, 2021). Since data collection, several new methods of assessing semantic distance have been developed, particular within the creativity and semantic priming literatures (Kennett, 2019; Kumar et\u00a0al., 2020). One alternative is to assess semantic distance by combining multiple models of semantic distance into one latent variable. Thus, we also assessed semantic distance in our analogies using SemDis (Beaty & Johnson, 2021; http:// semdis. wlu. psu. edu), which is based on five semantic space models. Because we were assessing the semantic distance between the A:B and C:D word pairs, we chose to use the recommended multiplicative model that takes the product of all word vectors to create a single vector for a phrase. The mean SemDis scores were again greater, indicating greater distance, for the far analogies (M = .92, SD = .04) than for the near ones (M = .75, SD = .11), t(58) = 7.84, p < .001, Cohen\u2019s d = 2.05, although there was a small degree of overlap in the SemDis scores across conditions (see Supplemental Materials\u2014Boxplots).\nDistracter salience Each analogy (e.g., accountant:profes sion::carrot:________) was presented with either a high salient distracter (potato) or with a low salience distracter (rabbit). The distracters (D\u2032) were selected originally to have a semantic distance (1 \u2212 LSA cosine) that was greater than the correct answer D-term for the high salience D\u2032 and less than that for the correct answer for the low salience D\u2032. We also assessed semantic distance using the SemDis scores as described above between the C-term and each possible D-term response. There was only minimal overlap across the three conditions on both semantic distance measures (see Supplemental Materials\u2014Boxplots).\nFinally, given the limitations of using corpus-based semantic distance methods to predict human behavior (De Deyne et\u00a0al., 2019; Kennett, 2019; Kennett et\u00a0al., 2017; Kumar et\u00a0al., 2020), we included a measure based on human ratings. As was done in prior studies examining distracter salience (e.g., Morrison et\u00a0al., 2004; Thibaut et\u00a0al., 2010), we assessed the association strength between the C-term with the correct answer (D-term) as well as with the distractors (D\u2032-terms). Association strengths were assessed using the Small World of Words English Association Norms\n1483\n1 3\nPsychonomic Bulletin & Review (2022) 29:1480\u20131491\n(SWOW-EN), which indicate the number of times the D or D\u2032 term was in the top three responses as an associate of the C-term (De Deyne et\u00a0al., 2019). As shown in Table\u00a02, repeated-measures ANOVAs for these three measures with planned contrasts across the three C:D pairs (C-term each with correct response, high-salient distracter, and low-salient distracter), verified that the correct answer was indeed semantically closer to the C-term in comparison to the lowsalient distracter, but semantically farther than the highsalient distracter.\nPrior studies (Bugaiska & Thibaut, 2015; Thibaut et\u00a0al., 2010) also varied the association strengths between the A and B terms in addition to the C and D terms, with weakly associated analogies having low association strengths in both the A and B and the C and D terms. In our study, the A:B pairs and the C-term were the same across the distracter salience conditions. We assessed the semantic distance and association strengths for the A:B pairs and found that they did not differ between the near and far semantic distance conditions on the LSA-based scores, t(58) = .70, p = .48, SemDis scores, t(58) = 1.18, p = .24, and the SWOW-EN association strengths, t(58) = .24, p = .81.\nWord familiarity As noted in Ichien et\u00a0al. (2020), the familiarity of the words in the analogy can impact performance on verbal analogy tasks, with better performance on analogies with highly familiar words (happy:sad::fat:skinny) than those with less familiar words (jubilant:melancholy::corpul ent:gaunt). To verify that our analogies and answer choices consisted of highly familiar words, we used the English Lexicon Project (Balota et\u00a0al., 2007) to assess each word\u2019s familiarity using the age of acquisition (AoA; the age at which a word was learned; Kuperman et\u00a0al., 2012) and frequency per million words (measured using the SUBTL frequency norms from the SUBTLEXUS corpus that assess the more everyday use of the words in movie and television show subtitles; Brysbaert & New, 2009). AoA, SUBTL raw frequencies,\nand SUBTL log frequencies for each term as well as the Ms and SDs for each D-term are included in the Word Familiarity tab of the Supplemental Materials spreadsheet. Both measures indicated a high level of word familiarity for all the terms in the item set (including the distracter terms) with an overall early AoA (M = 6.41, SD = 2.19) and a high frequency (M = 30.03, SD = 55.43). Given that all of the terms in the data set were words that were learned prior to age 13.5 (range: 2.50 [spoon]\u201313.48 [latex]), it is unlikely that word familiarity would impact performance. Analyses further showed an overall lack of variation in the word familiarity measures across the semantic distance, distracter salience, and relation conditions. Given the extreme positive skew of the raw word frequencies (skew = 2.94), word frequencies are commonly analyzed using the log-transformed measures that were also available from the English Lexicon Project (Balota et\u00a0al., 2007). For comparison between the semantic distance conditions and across the analogical relations, an aggregate measure was calculated by averaging the AoA and log frequencies across the analogical stem (A-, B-, and C-terms). For the distracter salience conditions, the AoA and log frequencies were compared across the correct D-terms, high salience distracter, and low salience distracter. As indicated by independent-samples t tests, the aggregated word familiarity for the analogical stem terms did not differ in AoA between the near (M = 6.52, SD = 1.24) and far (M = 6.54, SD = 1.75) items, t(58) = \u2212.057, p = .96. Likewise, log frequencies did not differ between the near (M = 2.86, SD = .38) and far (M = 2.77, SD = .37) items, t(58) = .94, p = .35. Repeated-measures ANOVAs showed no differences across the correct, high-salience, or low salience D-terms for either the AoA, F(2, 112) = .11, p = .89, or for the log frequencies. F(2, 112) = .22, p = .80. Results of a one-way ANOVA showed no differences across the three relations on log frequencies, F(2, 57) = .44, p = .65. However, AoA varied across the analogical relations, F(2, 57) = 5.83, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .17. Tukey post hoc tests showed AoA was higher\nTable 2 Distances between C-term with each D-term\nNotes. Means and standard deviations of distance between the C-term with each of the D-terms. For the semantic distance measures, higher numbers indicate greater distances between the C and D terms.

In sum, given the highly familiar A-, B-, and C-terms in the analogical stems and possible D-terms, as well as the consistency across semantic distance, distracter salience, and relation conditions, word familiarity was unlikely to impact performance on the verbal analogy task."

All three main effects of Semantic Distance, Distracter Salience, and Relation were reliable (see Fig.\u00a01). As predicted, accuracies were higher for the semantically near analogies than for the semantically far analogies, F(1, 240) = 244.42, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .50. Likewise, analogies with low\nsalience distracters had higher accuracies than those with high salience distracters, F(1, 240) = 309.27, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .56. Performance also varied across the three relations, F(2, 480) = 186.26, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .44. Pairwise comparisons (with Bonferroni adjustments) indicated that the categorical analogies had much higher accuracies than the compositional analogies, and the causal analogies (both ps < .001). Accuracies for the compositional analogies were higher than the causal, p < .001.\nAll three two-way interactions were also reliable (see Fig.\u00a02). As predicted, the Semantic Distance \u00d7 Distracter Salience interaction, F(2, 240) = 34.14, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .12, showed a greater difference between the high and low distracter salience conditions within the far than within the near semantic distance analogies (.154 vs. .073). Recall that given the greater accessibility of the categorical in comparison to the causal and compositional relations, both far semantic distance and high distracter salience were predicted to have less of a detrimental impact within the categorical analogies. As predicted, the Relation \u00d7 Semantic Distance interaction, F(2, 480) = 76.46, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .24, showed almost no difference between the semantic distance conditions (near minus far) within the categorical analogies, but greater differences within the causal and compositional analogies. Similarly, the Relation \u00d7 Distracter Salience interaction, F(2, 480) = 26.06, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .10, indicated a smaller difference (low minus high) within the categorical analogies than within the causal or compositional ones.\nFinally, we observed a reliable three-way interaction, F(2, 480) = 20.22, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .08 (see Fig.\u00a03). Additional ANOVAs examined the effects of semantic distance and distracter salience within each relation. Within the causal analogies, semantic distance F(1, 240) = 177.49, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .43, distracter salience, F(1, 240) = 159.99, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .40, and their interaction, F(1, 240) = 14.90, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .06, affected accuracies. The same pattern occurred within the compositional analogies, with semantic distance, F(1, 240) = 159.48, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .40, distracter salience, F(1, 240) = 145.70, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .38, and their interaction, F(1, 240) = 55.54, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .18, affecting accuracies. However, within the categorical analogies, only distracter salience impacted performance (Mhigh = .89, Mlow = .94), F(1, 240) = 37.16, p < .001, \u03b7p2 = .13 with no difference between the near and far semantic distance conditions, F(1, 240) < 1, p = .40, and no interaction, F(1, 240) = 1.43, p = .23."

Performance was higher for the categorical relations than for the compositional and causal relations.

            "text": "The semantic distance effect supports the hypothesis that semantic similarity between domains facilitates the one-toone mapping of corresponding analogy terms (Gentner & Smith, 2012; Holyoak & Thagard, 1997). That is, mapping between the far analogies relies on a more abstracted structural similarity between relational roles. Thus, the greater structural and semantic similarity between the source and target resulted in more efficient mapping and thus better performance. However, when a high salience distracter was presented along with the correct D-term, the mapping process was derailed during response selection, as shown by the robust distracter salience effect.\nPrior results of distracter salience were limited to children (e.g., Thibaut et\u00a0al., 2010, except for Bugaiska & Thibaut, 2015) and patients with frontal lobe damage (Krawczyk et\u00a0al., 2008; Morrison et\u00a0al., 2004). Moreover, these prior studies used different analogy stems across distracter conditions (Bugaiska & Thibaut, 2015) or included a perceptual distracter (Krawczyk et\u00a0al., 2008), thereby potentially confounding distracter salience with other aspects of the analogy. Our results extend the findings of distracter salience to younger adults using a highly controlled stimulus set that specifically manipulated the semantic association strengths between the C-term and distracters. Notably, the obtained interaction between semantic distance and distracter salience demonstrated that a high salience distracter can derail the mapping process more for far than for near analogies. Prior studies that showed strong effects of lure items usually presented three or four semantic distracters (Jones, 2011; Jones & Estes, 2015; Thibaut et\u00a0al., 2010); however, our observed distracter salience effects occurred with only one distracter,\nthus further showing the extent to which semantic information influences effective analogical mapping.\nThe greater accuracy for the categorical analogies supports the proposition that categorical relations are automatically activated as proposed by the micro-category account of analogy (Green et\u00a0al., 2008), and that exemplar-category word pairs generate greater semantic constraint for the possible second term. In fact, the constraint of the exemplarcategory relation was so strong that accuracies were equally high between the far and near semantic distances within this relation, though high distracter salience still impaired performance. Moreover, we speculate that the reduced performance on the compositional and causal analogies was due to the relative lack of semantic constraint in the process of analogical inference. In addition to replicating prior findings of superior performance for these categorical relations (e.g., Kmiecik et\u00a0al., 2019), our results demonstrated the important role of analogical relations in mapping. Performance on categorical analogies was unaffected by the semantic distance between source-target word pairs, whereas accuracies were higher on causal and compositional analogies when semantic distance was near. However, the lure of the more salient distracter still impacted performance even for the categorical relations, suggesting that inhibitory control plays an important role in analogy (e.g., Doumas et\u00a0al., 2018; Morrison et\u00a0al., 2004; Morrison et\u00a0al., 2011; Richland et\u00a0al., 2006)."

            "text": "Our study was not designed to discern the exact underlying reason for the superior performance on categorical relations (automatic activation of the categorical relation and/or the greater constraint of this relation). Future studies would need to compare this relation with other equally constraining analogical relations, such as opposite, that similarly constrains to one possible second term within each pair. Given the similarly better performance for the categorical and opposite relations found in prior studies (Sternberg & Nigro, 1980), semantic constraint may be an equally viable explanation as the micro-category account\u2019s proposed automatic activation for the categorical analogies\u2019 higher accuracies.\nThe extent to which a given word pair represents its assigned relation and how well the same relation is represented in both the source and target pairs could also affect analogical mapping (Popov et\u00a0al., 2017). For example, the categorical analogies may be good examples of the exemplar\u2013category relation, whereas the compositional analogies represent a broader relational category that includes more specific relational pairs representing subtypes of fabric of clothing (e.g., satin:dress), metal of objects (e.g., gold:earring), and ingredients of food (e.g., oatmeal:cookie). Despite their careful construction, our reliance on only computational measures to assess semantic\nFig. 2 Two-way interactions.

Indeed, the far semantic distance was conflated with the inclusion of different relational sub-types between the pairs (e.g., flour:tortilla::sil k:tie). If the level of relational inference were at this specific relational subtype rather than at the broader compositional relation, then it would be more challenging to detect the relational roles.\nThe current study presented 60 analogies that were evenly divided across three relations with each relation representing 33% of the items on a given experimental list. Given our robust relation effect, one future direction could be to assess whether presenting a higher proportion of the more challenging analogical relations would improve performance on them. The relational luring hypothesis postulates that activation strengths of relations increase with each presented exemplar (Popov et\u00a0al., 2017); thereby, we speculate that performance would increase for causal and other more challenging relations when presented at higher proportions."
