    "abstractText": "There have been conflicting findings on the degree to which rapidly deployed visual attention is selective for depth, and this issue has important implications for attention models. Previous findings have attempted to find depth-based cueing effects on such attention using reaction time (RT) measures for stimuli presented in stereo goggles with a display screen. Results stemming from such approaches have been mixed, depending on whether target/distractor discrimination was required. To help clarify the existence of such depth effects, we have developed a paradigm that measures accuracy rather than RT in an immersive virtual-reality environment, providing a more appropriate context of depth. Three modified Posner Cueing paradigms were run to test for depth-specific rapid attentional selectivity. Participants fixated a cross while attempting to identify a rapidly masked black letter preceded by a red cue that could be valid in depth, side, or both. In Experiment 1a, a potent cueing effect was found for lateral cueing validity, but a weak effect was found for depth despite an extreme difference in virtual depth (1 vs. 300 m). In Experiment 1b, a near-replication of 1a, the lateral effect replicated while the depth effect did not. Finally, in Experiment 2, to increase the depth cue\u2019s effectiveness, the letter matched the cue\u2019s color, and the presentation duration was increased; however, again only a minimal depth-based cueing effect \u2013 no greater than that of Experiment 1a \u2013 was observed. Thus, we conclude that rapidly deployed attention is driven largely by spatiotopic rather than depth-based information.",

            "text": "Managing the enormous amount of information from the eyes through the optic nerve is a challenge that visual attention\nhelps to manage. There are many aspects of attention, including eye movements as the stereotypically overt form of attention. Complementary to eye movements is the well-studied covert form of visual attention in which changes in neural processing within the visual system allow it to reconfigure the way it processes information (Yeshurun & Carrasco, 1998; Zhang et al., 2011). For example, the deployment of covert attention can emphasize spatial locations (Eriksen & Yeh, 1985; Posner, 1980; Wyble et al., 2020; Yantis & Serences, 2003), objects (Chen, 2012; Egly et al., 1994; Reppa et al., 2012), or specific visual features (Chapman & St\u00f6rmer, 2021; Ling et al., 2009; Maunsell & Treue, 2006; St\u00f6rmer & Alvarez, 2014). One of the most robust forms of spatial covert attention is the reflexive variety that is commonly assessed via the Posner Cueing Paradigm, in which a cue (e.g., an onset stimulus such as a circle or a square) elicits a potent and rapid increase in processing efficiency at its own location (Posner, 1980; Posner & Cohen, 1984).\nWith only a few exceptions, studies exploring covert reflexive visual attention have not manipulated depth as a factor. This is an important limitation of the literature because it has encouraged a view of visual processing that is focused on a\nSignificance statement Visual attention is strongly linked to a spatial reference frame, which corresponds to the two-dimensional retinotopic visual input. Vision often has a strong sense of depth as well, due to a variety of depth cues. Previous results regarding the mind\u2019s ability to rapidly attend to specific depth planes have been mixed. Here, we show that at the earliest stages of rapid attentional deployment, attention minimally incorporates depth information into the two-dimensional framework, supporting the current implementation of many computational theories of rapid attention and highlighting a key distinction about when attention operates in two dimensions compared to three.\n* Ryan E.

For example, while it is widely acknowledged that binocular disparity cells exist, they are rarely incorporated into models of visual attention (e.g., Itti & Koch, 2000; Tsotsos, 1995; Tsotsos et al., 1995; Wyble et al., 2020).\nHowever, it is clearly possible to attend to different depth planes via overt, sustained attention (de Gonzaga Gawryszewski et al., 1987; He & Nakayama, 1995; Marrara & Moore, 2000; Viswanathan & Mingolla, 2002), and the existence of binocular disparity cells within the visual system leaves open the possibility that rapid forms of covert attention could select for different depth planes as well. Thus, there is a possible mechanism for rapid cueing in depth, and such a finding would challenge the standard notion of twodimensional topographic feed-forward projections between layers that characterize many attention models.\nPrevious studies have explored the question of spatial cueing in depth using binocular disparity as a depth cue. Ghirardelli and Folk (1996) used a standard cueing experiment with a polarizing stereoscopic display. Participants provided a speeded two-alternative forced-choice response to a character during two kinds of cueing trials that were randomly intermixed. In half of the trials, the onset cue and target always appeared on the horopter but at the same or different positions on the horizontal meridian (i.e., depth kept constant), while in the other half they always appeared at the same position on the horizontal meridian but on different sides of the horopter (i.e., side kept constant). The paradigm found a standard cueing effect (faster RTs to valid than invalid trials with neutral RTs roughly in between) on trials where depth was constant but horizontal position was changed. However, there was essentially no effect of cueing, either for valid or invalid trials, when the target and cue were at the same horizontal position but different binocular depths.\nAtchley et al. (1997) followed this up with a modified binocular disparity task that was made more difficult and had increased RTs by forcing subjects to identify a target presented among distractors. In this version, there was a significant RT benefit for a valid depth cue at a stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) of 150 ms. When they eliminated the distractor, RTs were much faster on average (more like those in Ghirardelli & Folk, 1996) and the depth validity effect disappeared. The authors explained this as an effect of perceptual load, such that the need to distinguish between targets and distractors revealed the depth validity effect. This is not consistent with spatiotopic attention because standard visual cueing studies going back to the original Posner paradigm have revealed RT effects with only a single target item, even in the simplest of stimulus-response paradigms.\nSince the depth cueing effect using RT seems to hinge on task difficulty in a way that is not consistent with conventional spatial cueing effects, we decided to explore depth-based cueing effects using accuracy as a dependent measure instead of\nRT. When properly calibrated, measuring cueing effects through accuracy for strongly masked letter targets can reveal very potent reflexive cueing effects (Wyble et al., 2009). Moreover, like Atchley et al. (1997), we used a display that contained a distractor so that the target had to be discriminated. Additionally, we added a staircase to ensure that the stimuli were presented at a speed that was highly challenging but perceivable for the participants. Finally, the other advantage we provided for a depth-based finding was to use a fully immersive environment such that any binocular disparity cues would be embedded in an environment that was consistent with depth planes. This environmental factor is important because perception is strongly contextual, and the fact that binocular displays are often presented on a monitor that is known to be flat could have reduced the effectiveness of disparity.\nIn this study, participants completed a modified Posner Cueing Paradigm, in which a covert cue could appear at the exact location of the target letter, at the same point on the horizontal meridian but at a different depth plane, at the same depth plane but on the opposite side of the horizontal meridian, or (in Experiment 2 only) at both the opposite side and different depth plane of the cue. Importantly, the experiments were designed so that participants could only rely on visual disparity of the targets to discriminate the depth planes. If rapid attention can be allocated to a specific depth plane, as observed by Atchley et al. (1997), then we should see reliably lower accuracy when depth is invalidly cued (but side is validly cued; termed depth invalid) compared to when both depth and side are validly cued (termed perfect valid). However, if attention is unable to be allocated to a specific point in depth at rapid timescales, we should observe no reliable accuracy difference between the perfect and depth invalid cues. In addition, we moved the location of the fixation cross across experiments to assess the influence of sustained fixation on a particular depth plane in target identification accuracy.\nExperiment 1a\nIn our first experiment, we created a virtual environment with a large difference in virtual disparity designed to be detectable to human observers without monocular depth cues (Allison et al., 2009; Amigo, 1963; Dees, 1966; Howard & Rogers, 2002; Kaufman et al., 2006; McKee et al., 1990; Morgan, 2003; Ogle, 1958; Palmer, 1999; Wheatstone, 1838): the front plane was 1 virtual meter from the observer while the back plane was 300m away. Additionally, the sizes of the stimuli in the front and back depth planes were matched for apparent size by visual superposition to avoid differences in depth perception according to the apparent size phenomenon (Hochberg & Hochberg, 1952)."

The front wall was gray, the side and back walls were dark gray with a blue grid pattern, and the ground was white with a gray grid pattern. A black fixation cross was positioned 230 m in front of the participant and 37 m off the ground. Shadows were included in the environment but were not visible due to the height of the observer over the floor. The participants were positioned on one side of the ceiling-less room 45 m from the virtual ground.\nTo elicit strong percepts of stereopsis, stimuli were presented at two depth planes: a front plane 1 m from the observer\nand a back plane 300 m from the observer. Four invisible black wire cubes were positioned in the room.2 The front two cubes were sized 0.1 m \u00d7 0.1 m \u00d7 0.1 m and smaller than the back two cubes, sized 30.5m \u00d7 30.5m \u00d7 30.5m. All of the boxes were positioned inside the room at a height of 28 m off the ground angled towards the camera by 11\u00b0 so as to align the boxes with the participant\u2019s view, as depicted in Fig. 1a. Participants could not navigate through the virtual space; they were only capable of rotating their head within the virtual environment. The head\u2019s virtual position was fixed.\nParticipants were instructed to identify the letter presented to them. Each target letter was presented alongside one distractor digit (Fig. 1b). The target was randomly selected from the set A, B, C, D, K, N, V, or Z. The distractor was randomly selected from the set 4, 6, and 9. Targets and distractors were scaled to be smaller or larger than their original size depending on their position in the virtual environment in order to appear to be the exact same size when projected onto the virtual reality (VR) display. The target and distractor were also rotated 11\u00b0 to be orthogonal to the viewer.\nAt the beginning of each trial, one of the invisible wireframe boxes flashed red for 40 ms, serving as the cue. An interval of 40 ms occurred between the cue offset and the target and distractor onset. One target and one distractor, which were two-dimensional flat images of a letter and number, appeared at the position of one of the four box frames. The target identity, distractor identity, and positions were randomized, with the stipulation that each stimulus appear on opposite sides and in different depths. A staircase algorithm controlled the duration of the target display, increasing the duration by 2 ms if the participant was incorrect and shortening the duration by 1.5 ms if correct across all trials to aim for an accuracy of about 80% across all conditions (Leek, 2001). The starting value for the staircase was 30 ms. After the target and distractor disappeared, a set of four masks consisting of a superimposed \u201c#\u201d and \u201c@\u201d symbol (also scaled to appear of equal size across depth planes on the VR display) appeared in the center of each of the wire cubes and remained on-screen until the participant\u2019s verbal response as to what target they saw was recorded. After reporting the target\u2019s identity, participants then reported the depth plane of the target as front or back. Verbal responses were recorded by the researcher in the room. The researcher also encouraged the participant to guess if they did not remember which letter they saw, and informed participants when their guess was not in the letter set before encouraging them to guess again. After responding, participants received feedback of what letter appeared and the next trial would begin.\n1 All size dimensions reported reflect virtual values in the Unity environment that were then represented as such through the Vive headset.\n2 The wire frames were made invisible because they were matched for apparent size. Had the boxes been made visible, the front plane would have occluded the back plane, and any back plane cues would be undetectable.\nThere were three types of trials (Fig. 1b): (1) perfect valid trials in which the cue and target appeared at the same depth and on the same side (i.e., the target letter appeared within the wireframe box that flickered red), (2) depth invalid trials in which the cue and target appeared on the same side but different depths, and (3) side invalid trials in which the cue and target appeared at the same depth but on different sides. Each trial type was randomly selected so as to occur approximately one-third of the time. Participants completed five practice trials with the target on-screen for 500 ms, and then completed 120 trials with the parameters described above."

For each paired t-test, a Bayes factor was also computed via JASP (Wagenmakers et al., 2018) to provide further evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis (BF10), Cauchy scale =\n0.707. BF10 < .33 is seen as evidence in favor of the null hypothesis, whereas BF10 > 3 is considered substantial evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis. Values that fall between 0.33 and 3 are considered anecdotal or inconclusive evidence (Kass & Raftery, 1995; Stefan et al., 2019).\nTo quantify the difference in cueing magnitude between side invalid and depth invalid cueing, we generated 95% bootstrapped confidence intervals (bCIs) around the effect sizes of the depth invalid versus perfect valid and side invalid versus perfect valid paired t-tests (Banjanovic & Osborne, 2016). The magnitude of the effect sizes was deemed significantly different if the observed effect sizes did not overlap in the opposing bCI. Each bCI was generated with 10,000 iterations of t-tests run from bootstrapped resampling of the observed data. Additionally, a 95% bCI was calculated around the accuracy identifying the target\u2019s depth plane (10,000 iterations of sampling with replacement), with depth accuracy deemed as significantly above chance if the bCI did not contain chance performance (50%)."

Our results also revealed conflicting evidence regarding an observer\u2019s ability to rapidly incorporate depth information into attentional orienting. First, a small, inconclusive effect of depth validity was observed, yet participants also demonstrated an inability to identify the depth plane of the target at rapid timescales via explicit report. However, this inability to detect depth information was not because of a limitation in the paradigm or design of the virtual room.When asked to do so, two authors and one na\u00efve participant were able to explicitly identify the depth plane of the cue at the same rapid timescales as those of the experiment (100%, 85%, and 80% respective accuracy out of 20 trials). Each of these samples was individually significantly different from chance using a binomial test, all ps < .002. The same three individuals were able to identify the depth plane of the target at rapid timescales when the four masks were removed (100%, 90%, and 90% respective accuracy out of 20 trials).\nAdditionally, target identification accuracy was sensitive to the depth plane of the target, independent of the cueing manipulation. Specifically, targets presented on the back plane, which was closer to the fixation cross, were more accurately identified. Thus, it is unclear how strong an influence sustained fixation to the depth plane of the fixation cross has on the observed depthbased cueing observation, and if this effect is masking the sensitivity of rapid attentional deployment to depth information. To further assess this possibility, we replicated Experiment 1a, while changing the depth plane of the fixation cross to independently assess the reliability of a depth-based cueing effect and an endogenous attentional shift to the depth plane of the fixation cross.\nExperiment 1b"

            "text": "Taken together, the results of Experiment 1a and 1b suggest that when binocular disparity serves as the only informative depth signal to the observer in an immersive headset, participants cannot reliably attend to different depth planes at a rapid timescale. Though the location of the fixation cross can influence where focal attention is initially allocated in depth, and attention can rapidly deploy to a lateral position in a two-dimensional plane, the onset of the cue cannot rapidly shift attention to different depth planes in a way that strongly and reliably influences processing at a given depth plane. Moreover, in both Experiment 1a and Experiment 1b, the magnitude of the side invalid effect size was significantly greater than that of the depth invalid effect size. Collectively, these results suggest that when covert reflexive attention is cued to a new location, attentional allocation is largely compressed into a two-dimensional format.\nOne alternative account to our observations is that the paradigm is not designed to maximize rapid attentional deployment in depth. In particular, in Experiments 1a and 1b, though the cue was unpredictive, as in that it did not inform participants as to which condition was being presented, the nature of the experimental design made it so that the correct side was cued two-thirds of the time, and the correct depth two-thirds of the time. Thus, the cue was pseudo-predictive for the two spatial scales. This pseudo-predictability may have encouraged participants to over-rely on the lateral nature of the cue, potentially encouraging them to ignore depth information. Additionally, the cue may have been an imperfect design, as\nit only matched the target by its abrupt onset similarity. In our next experiment, we attempted a replication that controlled for these possible alternatives for why depth information was a minimal influence on attentional deployment in depth.\nExperiment 2\nExperiment 2 was similar to Experiments 1a and 1b with the exception that the parameters of the experiment were designed to strengthen the influence of depth validity. Specifically, participants now saw a red and a black letter on each trial and would report the red letter while ignoring the black letter (Fig. 4b). The cue was also red, so that there was a match between the color of the cue and the task relevant feature of the target. Additionally, a fully invalid condition was introduced tomake the cue spatially uninformative, ensuring that our previously observed results were not due to a biased utilization of lateral spatial cues. Finally, the display duration of the target was increased, to remove the possibility of feature conjunctions (the red cue masked the red letter when presented in the same location)."

            "text": "It is possible that the combination of a target-cue color mismatch, a pseudo-laterally predictive cue, and a rapid target presentation duration used in Experiments 1a and 1b minimized the effectiveness of cueing depth, thereby failing to reveal a cueing effect. However, Experiment 2 demonstrated that even with both a task relevant, laterally unpredictive cue and a\ngreater than chance ability to identify the depth plane of the target, there was still a stronger effect of laterality-based cueing compared to a weak \u2013 deemed inconclusive \u2013 depth-based cueing effect on target report. That this minor depth benefit is no greater than the effect previously observed in Experiment 1a \u2013 when no measures were taken to maximize depth-based attentional deployment \u2013 suggests that rapid depth-based attentional cueing by disparity is near inconsequential.\nMoreover, this experiment again demonstrated a discrepancy of target report based on the depth plane on which it was presented. Like Experiment 1b, targets presented on the same plane as the fixation cross were better reported, suggesting that the binocular effects of the paradigm are able to drive differences in fixation depth with consequent effects on perception at similar virtual depth planes. Thus, we can observe depth-based perceptual effects in VR, but they are largely nonimpactful with respect to rapid attentional orienting."

            "text": "The results of three experiments that utilize extreme manipulations of binocular disparity revealed small and unreliable evidence of attentional modulation across depth planes for highly salient cues presented about 100 ms prior to the target's onset. While these cues were able to reduce accuracy in reporting the target when cueing the opposite side of the visual display, there was very little difference in accuracy when the cue was presented in a different depth plane relative to the target.\nOne possibility is that participants could not rely upon depth-based cueing because of their inability to perceive depth without monocular cues. However, a core component of our argument is that depth cannot be successfully utilized at rapid timescales. As previously confirmed in Experiment 1a, two authors were able to explicitly report the depth of both the cue and the target when presented at the rapid timescales of the experiment with nearly perfect accuracy when the target was unmasked. Therefore, depth is discernable in our paradigm, but potentially not able to guide rapid attention. Another possibility for a minimally significant finding is that some participants were better able to perceive (and thus subsequently incorporate) depth information than others. As a test of this possibility, we correlated each participant's depth report accuracy (or their ability to perceive the target\u2019s depth) with their depth validity effect (perfect valid accuracy minus depth invalid accuracy). If participants who are better able to recognize depth manipulations are subsequently affected by cueing manipulations, then we should see a significant positive correlation between depth report accuracy and depth cueing validity. In all three experiments, this correlation was not significant: Experiment 1a, r = -.13, p = 0.56; Experiment 1b, r = .34, p = .14; Experiment 2, r = .22, p = .32, which supports the\nclaim that depth-based cueing has a minimal-at-best influence on rapid attentional deployment. Thus, despite the ability to rapidly orient to a different two-dimensional location, additional time is required to shift attention to a different depth plane.\nOur results are consistent with findings that attention can deploy to different depths at slower time courses, given that the depth plane of fixation had a clear effect on target accuracy across experiments (see also de Gonzaga Gawryszewski et al., 1987; He & Nakayama, 1995; Marrara & Moore, 2000). However, our results add support for further distinguishing rapid versus sustained forms of attention, as the rapid component of attention seems unable to use a depth cue effectively. This could also explain the discrepancy between paradigms with fast RTs that find no evidence of attention in depth (Ghirardelli & Folk, 1996; Iavecchia & Folk, 1994; Marrara & Moore, 2000) and paradigms with slower RTs or longer display durations that find some evidence (Atchley et al., 1997; Bauer et al., 2012; Marrara &Moore, 2000), if the latter investigations provided more of an opportunity for depthbased mechanisms to affect response time. Though our findings are suggestive of such an account, future work should more directly address this question regarding the time course of disparity based attentional deployment in depth.\nUltimately, our findings contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms that guide rapid attention in a spatial reference frame. The results suggest that in the initial, rapid stages of attentional deployment, three-dimensional space is largely pancaked into a two-dimensional reference frame, by attending to all (or at least all task-relevant) information within that space regardless of disparity. Our mixed results additionally suggest further nuance from the findings presented in the Introduction. Though we utilized distractors in the task like Atchley et al. (1997) and a very difficult target discrimination, we could not find a reliable depth-based cueing effect most likely because such an effect is small and inconsistent at rapid timescales. However, like Ghirardelli and Folk (1996), despite minimal to no evidence for depth-based attentional orienting, we show clear evidence of attentional orienting to lateral cues. This discrepancy between the importance of lateral versus depth information in rapid attentional orienting supports theories of spatial attention in which reflexive decisions to attend to a location are largely mediated by a two-dimensional representation that lacks depth information (e.g., Itti & Koch, 2000; Tsotsos, 1995; Tsotsos et al., 1995; Wyble et al., 2020). In other words, at least in the early \u2013 perhaps primarily feedforward \u2013 stages of attentional deployment, threedimensional space is largely (and imperfectly) pancaked into two dimensions, consistent with current models of spatial attention. Following an initial deployment of two-dimensional attention, subsequent mechanisms could elaborate these initial representations into depth-aware representations. These findings illustrate the importance of understanding how visual\nrepresentations unfold in time, allowing depth information to be computed after an initial feed-forward pass of processing.\nAcknowledgements This work was funded by NSF Grant 1734220.
