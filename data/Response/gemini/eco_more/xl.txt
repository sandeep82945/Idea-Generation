1. **Investigating the impact of different demand forecast models on the performance of the rolling horizon planning framework.** The paper uses the MMFE method for demand forecasting, but other models could be explored to see if they can improve the accuracy of the forecasts and, consequently, the performance of the planning framework.
2. **Developing a hybrid planning approach that combines the strengths of both deterministic and stochastic optimization.** The paper uses two separate optimization models, one deterministic and one stochastic, but a hybrid approach could be developed that combines the advantages of both models. For example, the deterministic model could be used to generate an initial production plan, and then the stochastic model could be used to fine-tune the plan by taking into account demand uncertainty.
3. **Extending the planning framework to consider additional factors, such as production costs, inventory holding costs, and transportation costs.** The paper focuses on minimizing the total costs of production, but other factors could be considered to make the planning framework more comprehensive. For example, the framework could be extended to consider the costs of production, inventory holding, and transportation, as well as the impact of these costs on the overall performance of the production system.
4. **Developing a rolling horizon planning framework for a multi-plant production system.** The paper considers a single-plant production system, but a rolling horizon planning framework could be developed for a multi-plant production system. This would be more complex, but it would allow for the optimization of production across multiple plants, which could lead to significant cost savings.
5. **Investigating the use of machine learning to improve the performance of the rolling horizon planning framework.** Machine learning could be used to improve the accuracy of the demand forecasts, to develop better optimization models, or to automate the planning process. This could lead to significant improvements in the performance of the planning framework.
