1. **Investigate the mechanisms by which temperature change may influence the acquisition and transmission of AMR.** This could involve studying the effects of temperature on bacterial growth, gene transfer, and the expression of antibiotic resistance genes.
2. **Examine the relationship between temperature change and AMR in different geographical regions and climates.** This would help to determine whether the relationship is consistent across different environmental conditions.
3. **Assess the impact of climate change on the prevalence and distribution of antibiotic-resistant pathogens in the environment.** This could involve studying the effects of temperature change on the survival and transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria in soil, water, and air.
4. **Develop models to predict the future impact of climate change on AMR.** This would help to inform public health policy and decision-making.
5. **Evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to mitigate the impact of climate change on AMR.** This could involve studying the effects of antibiotic stewardship programs, infection control measures, and environmental interventions.
