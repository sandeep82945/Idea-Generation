Exploration of Additional Handcrafted Features: Investigate the impact of incorporating more diverse handcrafted features, such as wavelet transforms or advanced statistical measures, on the segmentation performance. This could potentially capture more nuanced aspects of MRI scans, leading to further improvements in segmentation accuracy and robustness.

Integration with Other Deep Learning Architectures: Explore the combination of handcrafted features with other advanced deep learning architectures beyond CNNs, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) for synthetic data generation or transformers for capturing long-range dependencies within the image data. This could help in addressing challenges associated with data variability and limited dataset sizes.

Adaptive Fusion Mechanisms: Develop adaptive feature fusion techniques that dynamically determine the optimal way to integrate handcrafted and CNN-derived features based on the specific characteristics of the input data. This could involve machine learning algorithms that learn the best fusion strategy for maximizing segmentation performance on a given dataset.

Transfer Learning and Domain Adaptation: Investigate the effectiveness of the hybrid approach in a transfer learning context, where a model trained on one set of MRI data (e.g., high-grade gliomas) is adapted for segmentation tasks on another (e.g., low-grade gliomas or different types of brain tumors). This research could explore the role of handcrafted features in facilitating transfer learning and domain adaptation processes.

Explainability and Clinical Decision Support: Develop methodologies to enhance the explainability of the hybrid segmentation model, aiming to provide insights into how handcrafted features and CNN-derived features contribute to the segmentation outcomes. This research could lead to the development of interpretability tools that assist radiologists in understanding the model's decisions, potentially integrating these tools into clinical decision support systems to improve diagnostic accuracy and patient care.
