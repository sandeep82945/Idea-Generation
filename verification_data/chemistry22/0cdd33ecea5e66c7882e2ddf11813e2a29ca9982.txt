"As a potential agent for NSCLC treatment, there are need to more studies on kinetic degradation in human single recombinant CYP enzymes of CYP3A4, 1A2, 2E1, 2C19, RLMs, and HLMs and enzyme kinetic selectivity in RLMs and HLMs. The molecular mechanisms of CYP enzymes activity and the expression levels by curcumin or germacrone were detected in vitro and in vivo. It is possible to develop new target drugs and guide them to preclinical treatment."
