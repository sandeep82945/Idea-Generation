    "abstractText": "Background: Despite currently available state-of-the art therapies, a substantial proportion of patients with inflammatory cardiomyopathy progresses to advanced heart failure. There is an urgent need for novel therapies to improve outcomes. We hypothesized that elevated cytokine levels in inflammatory cardiomyopathy may lead to cardiac injury and that specific cytokines are associated with severely decreased left ventricular function consequently, thereby suggesting their potential as therapeutic targets. Methods and Results: Blood samples collected from 529 patients at 2 registries were investigated. First, in a derivation cohort of inflammatory cardiomyopathy from our medical center (n=63), we discovered cytokines that correlate inversely with severely decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). We confirmed reproducibility of our results in an independent cohort from a national registry (n=425) and to some degree generalizability in a small cohort of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM, n=41). In total, we identified 82 cytokines associated with severely decreased LVEF (FDR < 0.05); a small portion had been previously proposed as therapeutic targets, while others emerged as novel discoveries. Finally, real-world data from electronic medical records further indicated the potential of inhibitors targeting cytokines of interest to confer a cardioprotective effect. Conclusions: We identified 82 cytokines associated with severe inflammatory cardiomyopathy. Our data were highly significant, reproducible, and generalizable to IDCM. The fact that some of the cytokines had been suggested as potential targets in prior literature supports validity and plausibility of our data. Given that inhibition of cytokines is technically feasible, the identified proteins are compelling potential novel therapeutic targets.

There is an urgent need for novel therapies to improve outcomes. We hypothesized that elevated cytokine levels in inflammatory cardiomyopathy may lead to cardiac injury and that specific cytokines are associated with severely decreased left ventricular function consequently, thereby suggesting their potential as therapeutic targets. Methods and Results: Blood samples collected from 529 patients at 2 registries were investigated. First, in a derivation cohort of inflammatory cardiomyopathy from our medical center (n=63), we discovered cytokines that correlate inversely with severely decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). We confirmed reproducibility of our results in an independent cohort from a national registry (n=425) and to some degree generalizability in a small cohort of idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM, n=41). In total, we identified 82 cytokines associated with severely decreased LVEF (FDR < 0.05); a small portion had been previously proposed as therapeutic targets, while others emerged as novel discoveries. Finally, real-world data from electronic medical records further indicated the potential of inhibitors targeting cytokines of interest to confer a cardioprotective effect. Conclusions: We identified 82 cytokines associated with severe inflammatory cardiomyopathy. Our data were highly significant, reproducible, and generalizable to IDCM. The fact that some of the cytokines had been suggested as potential targets in prior literature supports validity and plausibility of our data. Given that inhibition of cytokines is technically feasible, the identified proteins are compelling potential novel therapeutic targets.\nTrial registration number: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04265040, NCT02187263"

            "text": "Inflammatory cardiomyopathy, including myocarditis, is one of the leading causes of sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young adults, with autopsy studies demonstrating that myocarditis is is one of the leading causes of SCD1. Despite being a significant public health concern with potentially devastating outcomes, the pathophysiology of inflammatory cardiomyopathy is not well understood, and the condition is often underdiagnosed2, leading to suboptimal treatment outcomes for many patients3.\nThe development of drugs for inflammatory cardiomyopathy has been stagnant for\nmore than two decades4, with steroids remaining a mainstay of therapy for severe cases5. However, steroids are a non-specific treatment that can have various side effects5. Despite available treatments, a considerable number of patients initially diagnosed with complicated inflammatory cardiomyopathy progress to chronic heart failure, enduring additional cardiovascular complications6.\nA recent study following patients with virus-negative chronic inflammatory cardiomy-\nopathy over 20 years found that patients treated with prednisone and azathioprine had better prognostic outcomes than their counterparts, who were treated with standard heart failure therapy alone7. Immunosuppressive therapy improved cardiovascular outcomes, including a significantly lower risk of cardiovascular death and heart transplantation, improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and a lower likelihood of needing an ICD7. However, not all patients with virus-negative chronic inflammatory cardiomyopathy respond to immunosuppression with prednisone and azathioprin and may worsen clinically consequently7,8.\nFurther studies are underway to evaluate the effect of immunosuppressive therapy in\nvirus-negative inflammatory cardiomyopathy in randomized, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials (TRINITY, ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05570409; IMPROVE-MC, ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT04654988).\nIn recent years, there has been a growing interest in the role of inflammation in heart\nfailure of various etiologies. It is increasingly recognized that a systemic inflammatory state, particularly in inflammatory cardiomyopathy, may contribute to a decline in left ventricular ejection fraction9. The impact of systemic inflammation on cardiac injury and the role of cytokines has been increasingly reported in the literature10-14.\nTherefore, we hypothesized that some cytokines in the context of inflammatory cardi-\nomyopathy may lead to myocardial injury and decreased LVEF consequently. Investigating cytokines that are associated with a severe clinical course of inflammatory cardiomyopathy may help to identify novel drug targets that could be blocked with monoclonal antibodies15,16 or potentially removed through filtration or immunoadsorption techniques17,18. Increasing evidence in the literature suggests that this is a reasonable approach, as blocking cytokines, their receptors, or intracellular kinases further downstream of cytokine signaling were successfully applied in autoimmune diseases and other states of systemic inflammation such as inflammatory cardiomyopathy3, sepsis19, COVID-1920, and in cytokine storm after chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-T cell treatment21.\nOur derivation cohort consisted exclusively of patients with biopsy-proven inflamma-\ntory cardiomyopathy to ascertain the main results of our study in a cohort with a definitive diagnosis of inflammatory cardiomyopathy. The validation cohort also included patients who were diagnosed based on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging (CMR). Patients were divided into a group with severe inflammatory cardiomyopathy (LVEF \u2264 35%) and patients with mild to moderate inflammatory cardiomyopathy (LVEF > 35%). The choice for a cutoff of 35% for LVEF was guided based on the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines22, in which this cutoff is applied as an indicator for clinical severity and risk of severe arrhythmias. In a third step, we evaluated if our findings were broadly applicable to idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDCM). After that, a post-hoc analysis was performed on all samples included in this study.\nFinally, to evaluate for potential causality of the discovered cytokines, we evaluated if already existing therapeutic inhibitors of our cytokines of interest have a potential cardioprotective effect. For that purpose, we tested our hypothesis using real world data extracted from electronic medical records of patients who received cytokine inhibitors for various indications at our hospital."

As recommended, EMBs were obtained in clinical scenarios, in which the results of histology were expected to change management. Coronary artery disease was excluded in all patients via coronary angiography. Blood samples were systematically collected in EDTA plasma tubes at the time of EMB and stored at -80 \u00b0C.\nBased on the results of histology and comprehensive immunohistochemistry of EMBs,\nwe divided the patients into 2 groups: 1) Patients with inflammatory cardiomyopathy (n=63) and 2) patients with IDCM (n=41) based on the definition of the ESC23. Patients taking immunosuppressive or anti-inflammatory therapy at the time of EMB were excluded to avoid potential confounders. Based on echocardiographic data, patients were further divided into a group with severe inflammatory cardiomyopathy (LVEF \u2264 35%) and patients with mild-moderate inflammatory cardiomyopathy (LVEF > 35%). The same was applied to patients with IDCM.\nReplication of results in an independent cohort To evaluate if our results can be replicated in an independent cohort, we investigated blood samples from patients with inflammatory cardiomyopathy collected in a German national registry for cardiomyopathies. This registry contained samples from patients with a diagnosis of inflammatory cardiomyopathy collected within the Translational registry for cardiomyopathies (TORCH) network of the German Center for Cardiovascular Research e.V. (eingetragener Verein) /Deutsches Zentrum f\u00fcr Herzkreislaufforschung (DZHK). Patients were recruited at cardiovascular centers across Germany within the DZHK network since 2014. Samples were collected in EDTA tubes and stored within one hour after collection at -80 \u00b0C. Similar to the derivation cohort, patients who had received immunosuppression prior to sample collection were excluded from the analyses. Furthermore, patients missing relevant clinical data such as LVEF were excluded. Samples that qualified for our study were derived from 11 German centers."

P-values were corrected for multiple testing using a false discovery rate controlling procedure (Benjamini-Hochberg method)26.

These data were collected from three rheumatology departments at the Charit\u00e9 Universit\u00e4tsmedizin, Berlin. Electronic medical records (EMR) data were extracted from the clinical information system for the period from January 2018 to May 2023. The analysis concentrated on patients who were treated with inhibitors specifically targeting the cytokines identified in our study, or the pathways these cytokines influence downstream. This encompassed patients who had been administered IL-6 or Janus Kinase inhibitors, and for whom high-sensitivity troponin T (hs-TnT) and NT-proBNP measurements were obtainable. Only laboratory values obtained after the initiation of cytokine inhibitors were included in the analysis. From these laboratory values, the median was calculated for each patient. For patients who did not receive any cytokine inhibitors and therefore belonged to the control group of this analysis, the median was calculated from all available measurements. For each cytokine being investigated, a control group was established at a 1:4 ratio using the nearest matching procedure, identifying comparable individuals who had not undergone treatment with cytokine inhibitors. Matching criteria included cardiac, rheumatologic, autoimmune comorbidities, and renal insufficiency. Patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) below 30 ml/min/m\u00b2 were excluded from the analysis, as hs-TnT and NT-proBNP are affected by renal function. Outliers were identified using the boxplot method27 and were excluded from both the respective control group and cytokine inhibitor group. Subsequently, the medians of the respective laboratory values were compared using a Kruskal-Wallis test. Additionally, a linear model was computed."

            "text": "This study aimed to fill a crucial clinical gap in the treatment of inflammatory cardiomyopathy, by exploring new potential therapeutic targets for patients who do not respond to existing, advanced therapies. We hypothesized that some cytokines released in the context of inflammatory cardiomyopathy may lead to myocardial injury and decreased LVEF as a consequence. Therefore, we investigated the association of cytokines with LVEF. Our investigation proved our hypothesis that there was an inverse correlation of specific cytokines with LVEF.\nWe first identified our findings within a derivation cohort from our medical center (n=63). Then, we replicated our results in an independent validation cohort (n=425), which encompassed samples gathered from 11 different cardiovascular centers across Germany, as part of the national TORCH registry. Furthermore, testing of our results in patients with IDCM (n=41) suggested generalizability of our findings. A post-hoc analysis further confirmed the robustness of our data. Real-world data from our EMR system, specifically from patients treated with inhibitors targeting the cytokines identified in our study or the pathways they influence downstream, suggested a potential cardioprotective effect of such specific cytokine inhibition. These data support the validity of our hypothesis and findings. All three cohorts, including derivation, validation, and generalizability cohort, demonstrated a balanced distribution of key baseline parameters including sex, age, BMI, LVEF, and renal function. The sex distribution, with approximately one third of the participants being women is in agreement with prior literature3,10,13,28. Based on the median BMI, a large part of the patients was overweight. This is an observation that aligns with findings from prior work on inflam-\nmatory cardiomyopathy28. One may speculate that proinflammatory characteristics of adipose tissue could contribute to a predisposition of developing inflammatory cardiomyopathy28. A considerable proportion of patients (36.5% in the derivation cohort, 39.8% in the validation cohort and 41.5% in the generalizability cohort) exhibited severely compromised left ventricular function, ensuring a balanced representation of the degree of illness. Kidney function was overall preserved in all cohorts. According to ESC guidelines22, patients with LVEF \u226435% received more angiotensin-receptor blockers (ARBs) and diuretics compared to those with a higher LVEF. If this disparity in medication regimen influenced our study outcome, it likely concealed the observed association between specific cytokines and low LVEF, given that ARBs are known to possess antiinflammatory properties29,30. Our investigation confirmed the hypothesis that specific cytokines correlate with severe inflammatory cardiomyopathy as defined by severely reduced LVEF (\u226435%). This correlation was inverse, highly significant, and reproducible in a large independent set of samples that were collected at 11 different sites in Germany in a national registry. Furthermore, our data suggested that results may be generalizable to IDCM. Several of the cytokines identified had been suggested or evaluated as potential therapeutic targets in inflammatory cardiomyopathy previously, supporting validity and plausibility of our results. Similar to prior studies in patients with heart failure overall31-34, higher serum levels of IL6 or CRIM1 were associated with more severe forms of inflammatory cardiomyopathy in our study. Importantly, it had been shown previously that in IL6 deficient mice, prevalence and severity of myocarditis were reduced in the absence of IL631. In myocarditis, IL6 is produced by monocytes infiltrating the myocardium and differentiating into inflammatory macrophages, contributing to tissue degradation and T cell activation3.\nIL6 inhibitors tocilizumab and sarilumab have been administered successfully to patients with severe COVID-19 to mitigate the overactive cytokine response, improving survival35. Janus kinase inhibitors block downstream signaling of inflammatory pathways of IL6 and other cytokines. Investigation of our current EMR data demonstrating lower NT-proBNP and hs-TnT levels in patients receiving IL6 or janus kinase inhibitors is in agreement with existing literature suggesting that this drug classes reduce cardiac inflammation and injury31,36,37. Our study identified numerous novel cytokines that had either not been previously associated with severe inflammatory cardiomyopathy or had only been minimally explored within this context. These included COLEC 12 - a scavenger receptor that plays a role in host defense, LAIR1 \u2013 a protein expressed on human leukocytes and LILRB4 \u2013 a leukocyte immunoglobulin-like receptor (http://www.genenames.org/). FSTL3 was recently identified as relevant prognostic marker for major adverse cardiovascular events in stable coronary artery disease. Higher levels of FSTL3 were associated with poor outcomes38. Also in the current study, higher blood levels of FSTL3 were associated with severe inflammatory cardiomyopathy. LGALS9 is a protein that modulates cell-cell and cell-matrix interactions. It has been shown to promote innate immune cell activation by potentiating or synergizing toll-like receptor signaling39. Also, LGALS9 has been associated with the severity of myocarditis in mice infected with Coxsackievirus B3 and to have an immunomodulatory effect when administered in experimental myocarditis40. Our findings have important implications for future treatment of patients with inflammatory cardiomyopathy, who clinically deteriorate despite currently available state-of-the art medical therapy. Cytokines are feasible therapy targets as prior research has shown. Blocking of cytokines, their receptors, or intracellular kinases downstream of cytokine signaling has been successfully applied4, 16, 19, 20, 21, 22. Also, removal through immunoadsorption or -filtration may be applied. Drug-repurposing of already existing drugs that target the cytokines of inter-\nest such as Ixekizumab and Secukinumab to neutralize IL17A could be another approach that will be tested in future experiments."

To identify the optimal targets among those reported, further experiments on cardiomyocytes in cell culture as well as animal experiments will be necessary to evaluate for causality and potential side effects of inhibition. The cohort of IDCM was small. Generalizability of our findings will have to be tested in a larger cohort of IDCM."

            "text": "We tested the hypothesis that there is excess of specific cytokines in severe inflammatory cardiomyopathy, which may lead to cardiac injury and decreased LVEF as a result. Our investigation confirmed that 82 cytokines were elevated in patients with severe inflammatory cardiomyopathy. Furthermore, elevation of cytokine levels correlated inversely with LVEF. The data were not only statistically significant and reproducible, but also to a certain extent applicable to cases of IDCM.\nSome of these cytokines had been previously reported as potential therapy targets in inflammatory cardiomyopathy and heart failure in general, supporting validity and biological plausibility of our data. In addition, we discovered numerous novel cytokines of interest that have the potential to be used as therapeutic targets through binding and neutralizing agents, filtra-\ntion, immunoadsorption or drug repurposing of already existing drugs in patients, who clinically deteriorate despite current state-of-the art therapies."
