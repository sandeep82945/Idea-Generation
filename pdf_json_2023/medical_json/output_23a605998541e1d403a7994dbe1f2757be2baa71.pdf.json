ABSTRACT Objectives Low attendance rates for community health services reflect important barriers that prevent people from receiving the care they need. Services and health systems that seek to advance Universal Health Coverage need to understand and act on these factors. Formal qualitative research is the best way to elicit barriers and identify potential solutions, however traditional approaches take months to complete and can be very expensive. We aim to map the methods that have been used to rapidly elicit barriers to accessing community health services and identify potential solutions. Methods and analysis We will search MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Library and Global Health for empirical studies that use rapid methods (<14 days) to elicit barriers and potential solutions from intended service beneficiaries. We will exclude hospitalbased and 100% remotely delivered services. We will include studies conducted in any country from 1978 to present. We will not limit by language. Two reviewers will independently perform screening and data extraction, with disagreements resolved by a third reviewer. We will tabulate the different approaches used and present data on time, skills and financial requirements for each approach, as well as the governance framework and any strengths and weaknesses presented by the study authors. We will follow Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) scoping review guidance and report the review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and MetaAnalyses Extension for Scoping Reviews. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval is not required. We will share our findings in the peerreviewed literature, at conferences, and with WHO policymakers working in this space.

A recent international systematic review of non- attendance across all medical specialities estimated that 23% of clinic appointments\nare missed, with the highest rate observed in Africa (43%).1 Low attendance rates often reflect significant barriers faced by users.2 Marginalised populations are often the least likely to receive care.3 4 Improving access to ensure that all individuals and communities receive the care they need lies at the heart of Universal Health Coverage\u2014a core element in the Sustainable Development Agenda.5 6\nComplex supply and demand factors govern access to health services and multiple frameworks have been developed, typically defining access as the ability to perceive, seek, reach, pay for and engage with care.2 7\u201311 Access is increasingly being extended through the use of digital services and remote consultations.12 13 While these services are useful, they come with their own set of barriers and equity issues, and cannot fully replace the central role played by in- person clinical providers.12 14 When it comes to identifying barriers to attending in- person clinical services and potential solutions, WHO has noted that \u2018it is the experts who identify the problems and formulate interventions, while the problems and solutions as perceived by those at particular risk rarely constitute\nSTRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS OF THIS STUDY \u21d2 As far as we are aware, this will be the first review to evaluate the rapid approaches used to elicit barriers to access community health services and identify potential solutions. \u21d2 Improving access and grounding service improvements in community engagement are two major global health priorities. \u21d2 Our review will follow best- practice guidelines, use a search strategy devised by an information specialist, and use independent dual review at every stage. \u21d2 We will miss rapid approaches that have been used effectively but not written about, and those that take longer than 14 days to deliver findings.\nP atna).

Turk and colleagues note that health service interventions \u2018must be done with, and not simply done to, the people affected\u2019.18\nResearch evidence aligns with common sense in finding that involving communities in the development of services improves health outcomes and sustainability.18 For- profit enterprises seem to understand the value of engaging with their customers: many companies use focus groups and market research to continually hone their products and services to meet the evolving needs of their customer base.19 Our sense is that health programmes are less active in this space. Ideally\u2014given the scale of the problem\u2014 health system managers would be able to deploy affordable, rapid and methodologically sound tools to engage with the groups that face the highest barriers to accessing care in order to elicit their ideas for service improvements. In reality, existing qualitative elicitation and coproduction techniques commonly take more than a year to plan, execute, analyse and report.20 They require formal ethical review, formally trained qualitative researchers, the use of specialist software and qualitative expertise to interpret and apply the findings.20 21 These resource requirements are prohibitive for most health system managers, and in many low- income settings there is not a ready supply of specialist expertise.22 This can lead to well- conducted but one- off engagement activities where the findings are inappropriately generalised to other groups or at the other end of the spectrum are tokenistic and/or methodologically flawed efforts to gather and act on service user feedback, . We are interested in exploring whether it is possible to obtain meaningful and robust findings with rapid tools23; here defined as approaches that take 14 days or less \u2018from entering the field to through to delivery of findings\u201924 that is, contacting and recruiting participants, eliciting barriers through the collection and analysis of data, and developing a list of potential interventions to improve the service. Such tools would have very wide application across a broad range of settings and would support the development of PHC- oriented systems that are built on community engagement.25 While 14 days are essentially arbitrary, it reflects an ambitious target for delivering usable intelligence that aligns with the timescales offered by market research firms to political parties and companies.26"

We want to identify approaches that provide sound, non- tokenistic and actionable intelligence with minimal time, money, equipment, personnel, and skill requirements."

This definition is based on that used in the WHO Operational Framework for PHC a.28 We will use the WHO Operational Framework definition for \u2018community engagement\u2019 that is presented in the introduction.28 We note that Primary Health Care is not the same as community- based care: the former is a whole- of- society approach to health (that includes hospitals even though it focuses on primary care).25"

We will include approaches that engage a mix of users and providers as long as it is possible to disaggregate the findings pertaining to service user engagement.\nAs we are focusing on groups that face barriers to access, we will exclude approaches that exclusively engage with people who are present at their services, that is, our focus is on methods for contacting and engaging with non- attenders or their proxies."

This is an arbitrary threshold but draws from our clinical experience in leading health services and represents what we feel to be an acceptable amount of time to generate data to inform real- time decision- making.\nGiven that it is not standard practice to report the length of time taken to conduct research we anticipate that our search will not identify many studies. To overcome this issue we will include studies that do not state how long they took as long as they meet all other inclusion criteria. We will analyse these studies separately.\nWe will include all forms of established or novel methods from any scientific field of enquiry. We expect to find examples of the following types of method: \u25ba Interviews: face- to- face, telephone, video call. \u25ba Focus groups \u25ba Group system dynamic modelling \u25ba Q methodology \u25ba Nominal group technique. \u25ba Surveys: in- person, web, telephone, text message \u25ba Rapid ethnography"

This includes attending prebooked appointments as well as presenting to services that do not require appointments. We will include outreach services and home- based care, but exclude virtual/digital remote consults. We will also exclude compulsory care such as when patients are sectioned for mental healthcare, and services where no interaction with a clinician is required, such as automated services to obtain self- testing kits."

This choice has driven by our collective experience working with health service and system managers. We are aware that effective community engagement can often take (much) longer than 14 days, and that expediency may come at the cost of the value and nuance of the findings that are delivered. Nevertheless, just because it is unlikely that there are many robust approaches that can deliver meaningful and nontokenistic findings within a very short timeframe, we feel it is still worth examining the literature to understand this space. There is a risk that rapid approaches produce oversimplified findings that further compound issues for marginalised groups. We will be careful to assess these risks.\nTwitter Luke Nelson Allen @drlukeallen\nContributors LNA conceptualised and planned the study with SK, IG, JE, NT and AB.
