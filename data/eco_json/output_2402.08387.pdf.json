    "abstractText": "The Merton investment-consumption problem is fundamental, both in the field of finance, and in stochastic control. An important extension of the problem adds transaction costs, which is highly relevant from a financial perspective but also challenging from a control perspective because the solution now involves singular control. A further significant extension takes us from additive utility to stochastic differential utility (SDU), which allows time preferences and risk preferences to be disentangled. In this paper, we study this extended version of the Merton problem with proportional transaction costs and Epstein-Zin SDU. We fully characterise all parameter combinations for which the problem is well posed (which may depend on the level of transaction costs) and provide a full verification argument that relies on no additional technical assumptions and uses primal methods only. The case with SDU requires new mathematical techniques as duality methods break down. Even in the special case of (additive) power utility, our arguments are significantly simpler, more elegant and more far-reaching than the ones in the extant literature. This means that we can easily analyse aspects of the problem which previously have been very challenging, including comparative statics, boundary cases which heretofore have required separate treatment and the situation beyond the small transaction cost regime. A key and novel idea is to parametrise consumption and the value function in terms of the shadow fraction of wealth, which may be of much wider applicability.

            "text": "One of the fundamental problems of economic theory is to determine the optimal consumption and investment behaviour of agents who are endowed with an initial capital, who face a stochastic opportunity set and who are averse to fluctuations of consumption both with respect to time and with respect to stochastic innovations. In a classic formulation of the problem, known as the Merton problem [22, 23], an agent with constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) seeks to maximise the expected, integrated, discounted utility of consumption over the infinite horizon, where consumption is financed from initial wealth and from investments in a risky asset driven by Brownian motion. The important outputs are the optimal instantaneous rate of consumption and the optimal fraction of wealth the agent should invest in the risky asset.\n\u2217University of Warwick, Department of Statistics, Coventry, CV4 7AL, UK.

Email: alex.tse@ucl.ac.uk.\nAs well as being a key problem in economics, the Merton problem is also a classical problem in stochastic control. Merton [22] showed how to derive the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation for the problem and found the value function and optimal strategy. Although his arguments are heuristic1, his solution is correct: namely, when the problem is well-posed the agent should consume at a rate which is a constant proportion of wealth and invest a constant fraction of wealth in the risky asset, where these constants can be expressed in terms of the parameters of the financial market and the agent\u2019s preferences.\nMerton\u2019s solution of the investment-consumption problem is a beautiful application of stochastic control, and was one of the inspirations behind many subsequent developments of the theory, including the use of Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, verification arguments and the martingale optimality principle, and the dual approach, see, for example, Fleming and Soner [8], and Pham [24]. But, from a practical perspective, the final answer is unsatisfactory in two important ways. First, the suggestion that agents should invest a constant fraction of wealth in the risky asset is infeasible in markets with transaction costs: if the asset price follows a semi-martingale with non-trivial local martingale term, then to keep a constant fraction of wealth in the risky asset involves a trading strategy with infinite variation. Such a strategy would immediately exhaust the wealth of the agent if there are positive transaction costs. Second, the fraction of wealth that Merton proposes that agents should invest in the risky asset does not match the actual fraction that the representative agent invests in the financial market (as taken from US market data) \u2013 this is the equity premium puzzle of Mehra and Prescott [20]. The economics and mathematics literature has responded to these issues in two directions, first by adding transaction costs to the model, and second by assigning more sophisticated preferences to the agent in the form of recursive utility, and its continuous-time analogue stochastic differential utility.\nMagill and Constantinides [19] were the first to introduce transaction costs into the investmentconsumption model and to formulate the intuition which underpins the solution, namely that in (X,Y \u03a6) = (Cash, Value of investments in the risky asset) space2, instead of trading to be on the Merton line\nY \u03a6 X+Y \u03a6 = p (where p is a constant) agents should trade to keep the fraction of wealth in the risky asset in an interval (or equivalently to keep (X,Y \u03a6) in a no-transaction wedge). Davis and Norman [6] formalised the model, and explained that the resulting problem involved singular stochastic control, where the controlled process (Xt, Yt\u03a6t)t\u22650 is kept in the no-transaction region using local time pushes on the boundary. For some parameter combinations, Davis and Norman [6] showed that the value function could be expressed via the solution of two coupled first order ODEs with free-boundaries, but in terms of understanding the solution, and even of numerically solving the problem, further progress is challenging with this formulation. Shreve and Soner [26] improved on the Davis-Norman solution (in terms of the range of parameter combinations that were covered) using methods from viscosity solutions, but issues with giving a simple, accessible formulation of the value function and optimal strategy remained. Instead efforts turned to using asymptotic methods to give an expansion for the value function (and thence to derive an expansion for the optimal no-transaction region and consumption rate) in the regime of small transaction costs. The small transaction cost literature will be discussed in more detail in Section 7, but includes [25, 26, 16, 9, 3, 15].\nReturning to the case of general proportional transaction costs, significant progress was made when Choi et al [5] and Hobson et al [15] separately showed how the problem could be decoupled into first, solving a initial-value problem for a first order ODE (and then adjusting the initial value so that an integral equation is satisfied) and second, solving a further first order ODE. Indeed, very important quantities such as the locations of the boundaries of the no-transaction region can be determined from the solution of the first ODE only. Choi et al [5] took a dual approach based on the shadow price for the asset with transaction costs whereas Hobson et al [15] use the primal approach. Understanding the final form of the problem (including the set of possible behaviours of the first order ODE, and how they relate to the fundamental properties of the financial problem, eg, when is it well-posed) is simpler in the setting used by Hobson et al [15], but both approaches can by criticised for appearing to use \u2018magic\u2019 to transform\n1See Herdegen et al [10] for a modern, rigorous treatment of the problem. 2Here Y is the price of the risky asset, and \u03a6 is the number of shares held.\nthe problem into a simpler version \u2014 especially in [15] these transformations appear to have no economic motivation.\nThe second response in the literature is to extend the analysis to allow for recursive preferences. Additive preferences can be criticised for the fact that a single parameter is used to describe the agents attitude to fluctuations in consumption due to stochastic risk and their attitude to fluctuations in consumption over time. Recursive preferences postulate that the utility of current consumption depends on the value of future consumption. This makes it possible to separate risk aversion from the elasticity of inter-temporal substitution (EIS). In fact, for notational convenience we express our problem in terms of the elasticity of intertemporal complementarity (EIC) which is the reciprocal of the EIS. The analogue of recursive utility in continuous-time is stochastic differential utility, and in this setting the natural generalisation of the additive CRRA utility is Epstein-Zin stochastic differential utility (EZ-SDU) as proposed in Epstein and Zin [7].\nThe extension to EZ-SDU brings several challenges. In the finite-horizon setting, for a given consumption the associated value function is the solution of a backward stochastic differential equation (BSDE). But, over the infinite horizon it is not completely clear how to formulate an analogue of the terminal condition. Then, there are significant issues which arise concerning existence and uniqueness of solutions. Indeed, for many parameter combinations for EZ-SDU uniqueness fails for essentially every consumption stream and we must identify which value process we wish to associate to a given consumption stream (using an economic criteria, rather than an ad-hoc selection). Only when these questions have been resolved is it possible to optimise over admissible investment-consumption strategies (i.e. those which keep wealth non-negative). Fortunately these issues have been considered in depth in Herdegen et al [11, 12, 13]. Since the real issue is to define a value process given a consumption process, we can \u2018piggyback\u2019 on their analysis \u2013 the main impact of the introduction of transaction costs is to change the set of attainable consumption streams, and the value associated to a given consumption stream is unchanged.\nAlthough the literature on optimal investment and consumption with recursive utility is growing rapidly (see Chacko and Viceira [1], Kraft et al [18] and Xing [29]) it focuses on the frictionless case. The exception is Melnyk et al [21] who look for an asymptotic expansion of the value function in the case of small transaction costs and derive expressions for the asymptotic expansion for the no-transaction region and the optimal consumption, albeit under a restricted set of parameter combinations.\nIn this article we consider the lifetime investment and consumption problem in a financial market with transaction costs for an agent with recursive preferences. Our main contributions are as follows:\n(a) First, we give a complete solution of the consumption-investment problem in the case of EZ-SDU which is valid for all levels of transaction costs. This includes giving exact conditions for when the problem is well-posed. The methods are an extension of the analysis in the additive case in Hobson et al [15] and the solution involves finding a family of solutions to a first crossing problem for a first order ODE (indexed by its starting point on a curve) and fixing the solution for a given level of transaction costs by choosing the solution which satisfies an integral equation. The start and end point of this solution determine the boundaries of the no-transaction region. Other important quantities, such as the shadow price of the risky asset and the optimal consumption are given by the solutions of a further first order ODE (this time with fixed start and end points).\n(b) Second, we introduce a new key variable, namely the shadow fraction of wealth. If we make this the underlying variable (in preference, say, to the shadow price) then all other quantities can be expressed in a simple fashion in terms of this single variable. The idea of characterising problems via the shadow fraction of wealth is new and may have implications well beyond the investmentconsumption problem setting, and may lead to significant simplifications in other settings too. One immediate candidate example is maximising the long run rate of portfolio growth under transaction costs.\n(c) Third, we \u2018break the magician\u2019s code\u2019 and give interpretations to many of the quantities which arose\n\u2018by magic\u2019 in the analysis in [15]. There, the transformations lead to a great simplification due to an act of serendipity; here, we explain where they come from and how they may be interpreted. Thus q, n(q) and m(q) in [15] are here given interpretations as the shadow fraction of wealth, the optimal consumption rate per unit of wealth as a function of the shadow fraction of wealth, and the optimal consumption rate in a frictionless Merton model if the agent invests a constant fraction q of wealth in the risky asset.\n(d) Fourth, use of the shadow fraction of wealth as a key variable simplifies many of the arguments. At points in the analysis we have to consider a highly non-standard ODE which passes through a singular point (and has multiple solutions to the left of this point, and just one to the right). In our coordinate system this analysis becomes relatively straightforward (whereas in other systems understanding the phase-space of the solutions can be difficult). One implication is that we only need a one-dimensional version of Tanaka\u2019s results to define the underlying processes via a local time, whereas to date much of the literature has been forced to rely on a multidimensional version. Further, we can treat several boundary cases as part of the main analysis, including the case when one of the boundaries of the no-transaction region corresponds to a portfolio with no cash component, and then the leading term in a small-transaction cost expansion for the locations of the boundary of the no-transaction region is of a different order to the standard case.\n(e) Fifth, we show how risk aversion R mainly governs the optimal investment strategy and the notransaction region (the co-efficient of elasticity of inter-temporal complimentarity S does not appear directly in any of the first three terms of the expansion in small transaction costs for the boundaries of the no-trade interval) and S mainly governs the rate of consumption. Further, (following on from Jane\u010dek and Shreve [16] in the additive case R = S and Melnyk et al [21] for EZ-SDU) we show that consumption may increase or decrease with the introduction of small transaction costs, and we give an explanation which shows that the introduction of transaction costs will increase the instantaneous consumption rate if S is small and decrease it if S is large.\n(f) Sixth, we investigate analytically the comparative statics with respect to the risk aversion parameter R and the elasticity of inter-temporal complimentarity S. One of the advances of this paper is that we do not (only) consider the additive case, and therefore it is possible for the first time to disentangle the impact of risk aversion and the intertemporal substitution. We find that in many circumstances (for example, if R < 1 or R \u2265 2) the boundaries of the no-transaction region are monotonic in the risk aversion parameter in the sense that the agent with higher risk aversion buys and sells the risky asset when the fraction of wealth in the risky asset is at a lower threshold than an agent with lower risk aversion investing and consuming in the same market. However, this is not universal and for R \u2208 (1, 2) this monotonic relationship can fail. The dependence of the no transaction wedge on S is less clear cut, and whether the no-transaction region moves towards or away from a cash portfolio depends on a crucial combination of parameters, see Section 8.\nAlong the way we give several other interesting, original and important results:\n(a) We give precise statements for when the problem under EZ-SDU is well posed for all level of transaction costs, when it is ill-posed for all levels of transaction costs, and when it is well-posed for some levels of transaction costs and ill-posed for others. In the latter case we give an expression for the threshold level of transaction costs at which the problem becomes ill-posed.\n(b) Unlike most other authors we allow for different transaction costs on buying and selling; often the literature assumes that these costs are the same, or that the transaction cost on selling is zero. Whilst there is a straightforward transformation between the various parameterisations of transaction costs, covering the general case facilitates an easy comparison to the individual cases. It also highlights that, for small transaction costs, the individual transaction costs only enter the expansion at a higher order level, and the first few terms only involve the round-trip transaction cost.\n(c) We show that if the Merton line lies in the first quadrant (i.e. in the case of zero transaction costs the optimal portfolio involves a long position in both the risky asset and the risk-less asset) then it is always inside the no-transaction region; however if the Merton line is not in the first quadrant then it can lie outside the no transaction wedge (and thus becomes a very poor approximation of a reasonable investment strategy).\n(d) We show that if (for large enough transaction costs) the positions corresponding to all wealth being held in the risky asset lie inside the no-transaction region then (for large transaction costs) the location of the sale-boundary on the no-transaction region is independent of the transaction cost for buying.\n(e) We give the asymptotic expansion for the value function and other quantities in the small transaction cost regime to a higher order than has been given elsewhere.\nThe remainder of the paper is structured as follows. In Section 2 we introduce stochastic differential utility and discuss the formulation of the investment consumption problem under Epstein-Zin SDU over the infinite horizon. In Section 3 we solve the frictionless investment-consumption problem for EZ-SDU. The arguments are extended to the case with frictions in Sections 4 and 5 with Section 4 focussing on the heuristics and Section 5 concentrating on the rigorous statements. Section 6 gives some illustrative numerical examples and Section 7 covers the asymptotics in the small transaction regime. In Section 8 we consider the comparative statics with the respect to the two key parameters of EZ-SDU, namely the risk aversion R and the elasticity of intertemporal complementarity S. Some of the more technical material is relegated to the appendices."

Given a nonnegative progressively measurable stochastic process C = (Ct)t\u22650, called a consumption stream, we seek to find a utility process V C = (V Ct )t\u22650 that solves the equation\nVt = E\n[ \u222b \u221e\nt e\u2212\u03b4s C1\u2212Ss 1\u2212 S ((1\u2212R)Vs) \u03c1 ds\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 Ft ] .

We assume \u03b8 \u2208 (0,\u221e).\nThe necessity of this standing assumption can be seen from multiplying (2.2) on both sides by (1\u2212R). Then, with V\u0303 = (1\u2212R)V , which implicitly must be positive for it to be possible to take arbitrary powers, we have V\u0303t = \u03b8E[ \u222b\u221e t e \u2212\u03b4sC1\u2212Ss V\u0303 \u03c1 s ds|Ft] and we must have \u03b8 > 0 for the two sides of this equation to have the same sign. See Herdegen et al [11] for further discussion of this issue. For \u03b8 \u2208 (0, 1], we have existence and uniqueness of a utility process V C = (V Ct )t\u22650 solving (2.2) (in a generalised sense) for all consumption streams, see Herdegen et al [11]. By saying that V C solves (2.2) in a generalised sense we mean that we allow (1 \u2212 R)V C to take the value +\u221e provided that\nE\n[\n\u222b\u221e t e\n\u2212\u03b4s C 1\u2212S s\n1\u2212S\n( (1\u2212R)V Cs )\u03c1\nds \u2223 \u2223\n\u2223 Ft\n]\nalso takes the value +\u221e.\nTheorem 2.1 ([12, Theorem 6.9]). Suppose \u03b8 \u2264 1. For each C \u2208 P+, there exists a unique generalised utility process V C = (V Ct )t\u22650 solving (2.2) (in a generalised sense).\nBy contrast, if \u03b8 > 1, the situation is more involved because (2.2) has multiple solutions. For example, V \u2261 0 is always a solution to (2.2) when \u03c1 > 0. To get uniqueness we restrict ourselves to so-called proper solutions; see Herdegen et al [13] for a discussion of the issues.\nDefinition 2.2. Suppose C \u2208 P+ and suppose that V = (Vt)t\u22650 is a solution to (2.2). Then V is called a proper solution if (1\u2212R)Vt > 0 on {E [\u222b\u221e t e \u2212\u03b4\u03b8sC1\u2212Rs ds \u2223 \u2223Ft ] > 0} up to null sets for all t \u2265 0.\nDenote by UP\u2217 the collection of right-continuous processes C \u2208 P+ for which there exists a unique proper utility process V C = (V Ct )t\u22650 solving (2.2). The results of Herdegen et al [13] (especially Proposition 4.8) show that is a wide class of processes. When \u03b8 > 1 we will optimise over consumption streams in UP\u2217."

It is customary in the literature to parameterise trading strategies in terms of fractions of wealth (rather than numbers of shares). However, this parametrisation is less suitable for the problem with transaction costs. For this reason, and to make an easy comparison with the frictionless case, we also parameterise trading in the frictionless problem in numbers of shares.\nDefinition 3.2.

We denote the set of admissible investment-consumption strategies for z > 0 by A0(z).\nSince the utility value associated to an admissible investment-consumption strategy only depends upon consumption, and not upon the amount invested into the risky asset, we also introduce the following definition:\nDefinition 3.3.

Clearly, qM is the famous Merton ratio. Thus, in frictionless market the optimal fraction of wealth to invest in the risky asset is independent of the elasticity of intertemporal complimentarity.\nThe above analysis yields a candidate value function and a candidate optimal strategy. It is well known that\nTheorem 3.4 ([21, 12, 13]). Consider the frictionless market. Suppose that mM = m(qM ) = m ( \u03bb \u03c3R )\n> 0. Then the optimal-investment consumption problem is well-posed, and the value function is given by\nV0 = sup C\u2208C \u22170 (z)\nV C0 = z1\u2212R\n1\u2212R m\u2212\u03b8SM\nThe optimal strategy is (C\u2217 = mMZ,\u03a6 = \u03bb \u03c3R Z Y ).\nIf mM \u2264 0 then the problem is ill-posed.\nRemark 3.5. The shape of m = m(q) will play a key role in later arguments. The shape of m is determined by the shape of H(q,m) as given in (3.5), and as a function parameterised by R and S, the shape of H is determined by the sign of (S \u2212 1). In particular, when S < 1, H is convex in q, and this property is inherited by m(q) (see Section 8.3 for details of how this inheritance works). Then, m(q) has a minimum over q \u2208 R at qM . Conversely, when S > 1, H is concave in q, this property is inherited by m, and m has a maximum (over q \u2208 R such that H(q,m) > 0) at qM . Indeed, given the sign of V , this must be the case for V in (3.8) to have an interior maximum in q.\nEconomically, the explanation is as follows. If the agent invests a suboptimal fraction of wealth in the risky asset then this will reduce the certainty equivalent value of their holdings. This will have two opposite implications. First, since they are implicitly less wealthy (in certainty equivalent terms), they will reduce instantaneous consumption, and as a fraction of their current wealth their consumption rate will fall. Second, the primary cause of the reduction of certainty equivalent wealth is a reduction in the valuation of future (rather than current) consumption, and this will encourage them to increase the rate of instantaneous consumption. When the elasticity of inter-temporal complementarity S is small (and the coefficient of inter-temporal substitution is large), the desire to smooth consumption over time is small (see Herdegen et al [11, Section 4.1]) and the second effect dominates. When S is larger, the desire to seek smooth consumption over time is increased and the first effect dominates.\nWe return to this issue in Remark 7.6(c) and Section 8.3."

It will follow from later analysis (see Proposition 5.3) that qM \u2208 [q\u2217, q \u2217] so that the Merton ratio lies inside the no-transaction region expressed in terms of fractions of shadow wealth. But this does imply that qM \u2208 [p\u2217, p\n\u2217], and it is possible that the Merton line lies outside the no-transaction region. This can only happen when qM /\u2208 [0, 1]. For example, in the case qM > 1, if \u03b3\n\u2193 > qMqM\u22121 then the Merton line does\nnot even lie in the solvency region S\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 .

The fact that it is initially increasing will follow from the small transaction cost results and especially Corollary 7.3; the fact that it must subsequently decrease will follow from the fact that the no-transaction region must lie inside the solvency region.

First, if R < 1, the problem with friction cannot be well posed if either investing nothing (q = 0) or everything (q = 1) in the risky asset leads to infinite wealth in the frictionless problem (which is the case if m(0) \u2264 0 or m(1) \u2264 0, respectively) since these are the two cases where the frictionless strategy is also admissible with friction; the corresponding wealth is either the same if q = 0 or reduced by the factor 1\n\u03b3\u2193 if\nq = 1. But even if m(0),m(1) > 0, the frictionless Merton problem will be ill-posed if m(qM ) \u2264 0. Hence, the problem with friction is only well-posed if transaction costs are sufficiently large.\nNext, if R > 1, the problem with friction cannot be well posed if the frictionless Merton problem is not well posed, i.e., if m(qM ) \u2264 0. But even if m(qM ) > 0, the problem with friction is only well-posed if transaction costs are sufficiently small.\nWe shall show in Section 5.6 that if \u03be := \u03b3\u2191\u03b3\u2193 does not lie in the well-posedness range of transaction costs, the problem (4.3) is ill-posed.\nRemark 5.2. If m in case (a) of Definition 5.1 has two distinct zeros qm\u2212 < q m + , then \u03be < \u221e since either qm\u2212 < q m + < 0 or 0 < q m \u2212 < q m + < 1 or 1 < q m \u2212 < q m + by the assumption that m(0),m(1) > 0.\nIn case (b) of Definition 5.1, however, if m(qM ) > 0, then m always has two distinct zeros q m \u2212 < q m + . Moreover, \u03be = \u221e if and only if m(0) \u2265 0 or m(1) \u2265 0 or there exists q \u2208 (0, 1) with \u2113(q) \u2265 0.

            "text": "We next turn to the no-transaction region in terms of real (as opposed to shadow) quantities. We shall see that the relationship between the real no-transaction region and the shadow no-transaction region is neatly described by real M\u00f6bius transformations.\nDefinition 5.5. Denote by R \u222a {\u221e} the compactified real line. For c \u2208 (0,\u221e), define the real M\u00f6bius transformation \u03c4c : R \u222a {\u221e} \u2192 R \u222a {\u221e} by\n\u03c4c(q) :=\n\n \n \ncq 1+(c\u22121)q if q \u2208 R \\ { 1 1\u2212c}, \u221e if q = 11\u2212c , c c\u22121 if q = \u221e.\nNote that the pair ({\u03c4c, c \u2208 (0,\u221e)}, \u25e6) forms an Abelian group with the additional property\n\u03c4c \u25e6 \u03c4d = \u03c4cd, c, d \u2208 (0,\u221e).\nRemark 5.6. We write \u221e to distinguish this \u201cpoint at infinity\u201d from the points \u2212\u221e and \u221e of the extended real line. We also agree that any real number x satisfies both x > \u221e and x < \u221e, and therefore interpret (\u221e, x) as (\u2212\u221e, x) and (x,\u221e) as (x,\u221e). We finally agree that c/0 := \u221e for c \u2208 R \\ {0} so that \u03c41 = id.\nWith the help of M\u00f6bius transformations, we may define the boundary points of the real no-trade region (which depends on the transaction cost parameters \u03b3\u2191 and \u03b3\u2193 separately) in term of the boundary points of the shadow no-trade region (which depends on the transaction cost parameters \u03b3\u2191 and \u03b3\u2193 only through their product \u03be = \u03b3\u2191\u03b3\u2193).\nDefinition 5.7. Let \u03b3\u2191, \u03b3\u2193 \u2208 [1,\u221e) with \u03be := \u03b3\u2191\u03b3\u2193 > 1 be such that \u03be lies in the well-posedness range of transaction costs. Let q\u2217(\u03be), q \u2217(\u03be) be as in Proposition 5.3. Define p\u2217(\u03b3 \u2191, \u03b3\u2193), p\u2217(\u03b3\u2191, \u03b3\u2193) \u2208 R by\np\u2217(\u03b3 \u2191, \u03b3\u2193) := \u03c4 1\n\u03b3\u2191 (q\u2217(\u03be)) =\nq\u2217(\u03be)\n\u03b3\u2191 + (1\u2212 \u03b3\u2191)q\u2217(\u03be) , (5.10)\np\u2217(\u03b3\u2191, \u03b3\u2193) := \u03c4\u03b3\u2193(q \u2217(\u03be)) =\n\u03b3\u2193q\u2217(\u03be)\n1 + (\u03b3\u2193 \u2212 1)q\u2217(\u03be) .

Let \u03b3\u2191, \u03b3\u2193 \u2208 [1,\u221e) with \u03be := \u03b3\u2191\u03b3\u2193 > 1 be such that \u03be lies in the well-posedness range of transaction costs.

(a) It follows from Lemma 5.8 (see also Davis and Norman [6, p704]) that if the Merton line lies in the first quadrant, then the no-transaction region also lies in the first quadrant (i.e., it is never optimal to have a short position in either the riskless asset or the risky asset) and contains the Merton line. A numerical illustration of this case will be given in Section 6.1. However, if qM < 0 or if qM > 1, then it may be the case that qM lies outside the interval [p\u2217(\u03b3\n\u2191, \u03b3\u2193), p\u2217(\u03b3\u2191, \u03b3\u2193)] and that the Merton line lies outside the no-transaction region. As discussed in Remark 4.4 this has to be the case if \u03b3\u2193 > qMqM\u22121 . If qM > 1, then Davis and Norman [6, p704] conjectured that the no-transaction region lies in the second quadrant, but this need not be the case (although it must always intersect the second quadrant, and indeed we must have p\u2217(\u03b3\u2191, \u03b3\u2193) > 1). Conversely, Shreve and Soner [26, p675] conjectured that qM > p\n\u2217(\u03b3\u2191, \u03b3\u2193), whenever qM > 1, but this is not true for small transaction costs.\n(b) If qM > 1 (and mM ,m(1) > 0), a new phenomenon arises. It follows from Proposition 5.3 that if \u03be is large enough so that q\u2217(\u03be) < 1, then n\u03be passes through the singular point (1,m(1)) and on the interval (1, q\u2217(\u03be)), n\u03be does not depend on \u03be (and hence also q\n\u2217(\u03be) does not depend on \u03be). It follows that once \u03be is sufficiently large, p\u2217(\u03b3\u2191, \u03b3\u2193) is independent of \u03b3\u2193. In the additive case, Hobson et al [15, Corollary 5.4] give a financial explanation behind this observation, which also applies to the case of stochastic differential utility. In particular, if 1 \u2208 (q\u2217(\u03be), q\n\u2217(\u03be)), then it is possible (indeed inevitable) that at some point the agent, who finances consumption from cash wealth, will exhaust holdings of the risk-free asset. At this point they continue consuming, and finance consumption by borrowing. Subsequently they will sell units of the risky asset in order to stop their short position in the riskless asset from getting too large, but they will always have a short position in cash. Put simply the process Q never returns to the set (q\u2217(\u03be), 1] once it has left it; see also Theorem 5.13(a) below. It follows that if the initial holdings involve a short cash position, then the trajectory of the process (Xt,\u03a6t) will be such that Qt never hits the lower threshold q\u2217(\u03be), the agent will never purchase units of the risky asset, and the transaction costs on purchases is irrelevant.\nWe proceed to describe existence, uniqueness and further properties of the shadow fraction of wealth in terms of the real fraction of wealth.\nProposition 5.10.

Even in the additive case, the following result is not covered by standard results in the extant literature (see e.g. [26, 21]). For this reason, we provide a self-contained proof in Appendix A.3. Note that our proof only uses results on reflected SDEs in one dimension and is therefore technically substantially easier than the results in the extant literature (including [26, 21]), which rely on reflection result in a two dimensional domain.\nTheorem 5.13.

(5.16)\nRemark 5.14. (a) The case \u03c6y\u03b3\u2191(1 \u2212 q\u2217(\u03be)) < q\u2217(\u03be)x corresponds to starting in the region where the trading process \u03a6 involves an initial purchase of the risky asset, and the case \u03c6y\n\u03b3\u2193 (1 \u2212 q\u2217(\u03be)) > q\u2217(\u03be)x\ncorresponds to the case where the trading process involves an initial sale of the risky asset, and in each case the expression for X\u03020 given by (5.15) evaluated at t = 0 reflects the impact of the trade. Implicit in the statement is the fact that we cannot have both \u03c6y\u03b3\u2191(1\u2212 q\u2217(\u03be)) < q\u2217(\u03be)x and \u03c6y \u03b3\u2193 (1\u2212 q\u2217(\u03be)) > q\u2217(\u03be)x.\n(b) We can have 1 \u2208 (q\u2217(\u03be), q \u2217(\u03be)). Then the diffusion coefficient in (5.14) vanishes and the drift coefficient is positive for Q\u0302 = 1. In particular, the diffusion Q\u0302 is not regular for the domain (q\u2217(\u03be), q \u2217(\u03be)).\nIf Q\u0302s \u2265 1 then Q\u0302t > 1 for t > s. This is equivalent to the fact that if X\u0302s \u2264 0 then for t > s, we have X\u0302t < 0, and the agent always takes a short position in the risky asset, see also Remark 5.9(b).\n(c) We could instead start with dynamics for the candidate for P = Y \u03a6X+Y \u03a6 . These are given by:\ndP\u0302t\nP\u0302t(1\u2212 P\u0302t) =\n(\n(\u00b5\u2212 r)\u2212 \u03c32P\u0302t + n\u03be(q\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(P\u0302t))\n1\u2212 q\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(P\u0302t)\n)\ndt+ \u03c3 dBt + dGt\nq\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(P\u0302t)(1\u2212 q\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(P\u0302t)) .\nHowever, these dynamics are more complicated than those of Q\u0302, not least because they involves expressions like n\u03be(q\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(p)). Moreover, for P\u0302 = 1, the right hand side of the SDE is not well-defined.\nWe now link the candidate value function with the candidate optimal strategy.\nTheorem 5.15. Let \u03b3\u2191, \u03b3\u2193 \u2208 [1,\u221e) with \u03be := \u03b3\u2191\u03b3\u2193 > 1 be such that \u03be is in the well-posedness range of transaction costs.

Then C\u0302 is uniquely evaluable if \u03b8 \u2264 1 and uniquely proper with right-continuous paths if \u03b8 > 1. Moreover,\nV\u0302 \u03b3 \u2191,\u03b3\u2193(t,Xx,y,\u03c6,\u03a6\u0302,\u03a6\u0302t , Yt, C\u0302t) = V C\u0302 t P-a.s., t \u2265 0,\nwhere V C\u0302 denotes the unique utility process if \u03b8 \u2264 1 and the unique proper utility process if \u03b8 > 1."

The solutions to the family of ODEs (n(z)(q))q\u2265z introduced in part (a) of Proposition A.1 are only defined for z \u2208 (0, qm\u2212 ), where q m \u2212 is the smaller root of m(q) = 0. Each solution (n(z)(q))q\u2265z starts at (z,m(z)) and crosses m again at some (\u03b6+(z),m(\u03b6+(z))). Different choices of the left-starting point z correspond to different levels of total transaction costs \u03be = \u03b3\u2191\u03b3\u2193. The correct choice of z can be identified from the equation \u03a3+(z) = \u03b3\u2191\u03b3\u2193, where \u03a3+(\u00b7) is defined in Proposition A.1. Then the purchase and sale\n4Economically this means that the investement-consumption problem is well-posed when only investment in the risk-free asset is allowed, and also when only investment in the risky-asset is allowed, but the problem is ill-posed when transaction costs are zero and investment in both assets is permitted. Further, in the frictionless case, the optimal investment strategy involves a long position in both the risky asset and in cash.\nboundaries (in shadow portfolio weight) are given by q\u2217 = z and q \u2217 = \u03b6+(z). For example, Figure 1a shows two possible solutions to the ODE for n with different left-starting points and in turn different points of crossing with m. (Note, such solutions cannot cross, as they solve a first-order ODE with regular co-efficients, at least away from 1.) They correspond to the total transaction cost levels of \u03be = 1.69 and \u03be = 2.1125 respectively. Note that if the transaction costs are such that \u03be \u2264 1.1057 then the problem is ill-posed.\nConsider three combinations of transaction costs (\u03b3\u2191, \u03b3\u2193) given by (1.3, 1.3), (1.625, 1.3) and (1.625, 1.04) respectively. They are constructed such that Set 1 and Set 3 give the same value of \u03be = 1.69 whereas Set 2 gives \u03be = 2.1125. Fundamental quantities of the optimal solution under each set of transaction costs are shown in Figure 1. The dotted lines in each plot indicate the extension of the fundamental quantities beyond the no-transaction region (see Definition 5.11). The cross, circle and square markers locate the boundaries of the no-transaction region under Set 1, 2 and 3 of transaction costs respectively.\nIn Figure 1a, the transaction costs parameters of Set 1 and Set 3 yield identical optimal consumption rates per unit shadow wealth since n(\u00b7) and q\u2217\u2217 only depend on the total transaction costs \u03be. Set 2 carries a higher total transaction cost and then it follows that the optimal consumption rate (in shadow wealth terms) is higher (and the no-transaction interval (q\u2217, q\n\u2217) is wider). In contrast, Figure 1b and 1c show that the three sets of transaction costs result in different ratios of shadow-to-real price as well as mappings between real and shadow portfolio weights . This is because they are affected by \u03b3\u2191 and \u03b3\u2193 individually, not just via the total transaction costs \u03be = \u03b3\u2191\u03b3\u2193. These two quantities are monotonic with respect to the shadow portfolio weight.\nFigure 2 shows how the no-transaction region (in both real and shadow portfolio weights) changes with the transaction costs. In this case, p\u2217 and q\u2217 (resp. p\n\u2217 and q\u2217) are decreasing (resp. increasing) in both \u03b3\u2191 and \u03b3\u2193. But notably, Set 1 and 3 of the transaction costs will result in the same levels of q\u2217 and q\n\u2217, as indicated by the same levels of the cross and square markers in Figure 2a and 2b. In terms of real portfolio weights, Set 1 has a larger p\u2217 and p \u2217 than Set 3. This is due to the fact that p\u2217 and p \u2217 depend on \u03b3\u2191 and \u03b3\u2193 individually. Note as well that in this example (with Merton ratio below one, i.e. qM \u2208 (0, 1)) the no-transaction region [p\u2217, p\n\u2217] contains the Merton ratio for all level of transaction costs, and is always contained in the first quadrant (i.e. 0 < p\u2217 < qM < p\n\u2217 < 1), recall Remark 5.9. Several qualitative features are also apparent from Figures 1 and 2 which may be traced back to the fact that n is decreasing and solutions n with different starting points get closer as q increases. In particular we observe that q\u2217 varies more than q \u2217 as \u03be changes, and whilst \u03b3\u2191 affects both p\u2217 and p \u2217, \u03b3\u2193 mainly affects p\u2217.\n6.2 Second Numerical Example: R,S > 1 and qM > 1\nIn this example, we consider a combination of model parameters5 such that R,S > 1, m(q) > 0 for q \u2208 [0, 1] and qM > 1. Specifically, the Merton ratio is larger than one and the problem is well-posed for any level of transaction costs. An interesting feature in the case of the Merton ratio being above one is that all solutions to the family of ODEs in part (c) of Proposition A.2 with left-starting points below one will pass through the singular point (1,m(1)). Consequently, for any z < 1, we must have n[z](q) = n[1](q) on q \u2208 (1, \u03b6+(1)) and they all cross m at the same coordinate (\u03b6+(1),m(\u03b6+(1))). In the shadow fraction of wealth coordinates, the sale boundary q\u2217(\u03be) is constant as a function of \u03be for sufficiently high transaction costs. See Figure 3a for an example where the two plots of n correspond to \u03be = 1.69 and \u03be = 2.1125. On q < 1, the solution n corresponding to smaller \u03be dominates the solution corresponding to higher \u03be, although the magnitude of the difference is very small numerically. The two functions pass through the same singular point (1,m(1)) and coincide on q > 1 until they both cross m(q) again on q > 1 at the point indicated by the markers.\n5The parameters are such that the problem is well-posed for any value of transaction costs, and both when only investments in the risk-free asset are allowed and when only investments in the risky asset are allowed. Further, in the frictionless case, the optimal investment strategy involves borrowing to finance a leveraged position in the risky asset.\nWe consider the same three sets of transaction costs as in Example 1. Set 1 and Set 3 again result in identical optimal consumption rates (as functions of shadow wealth) as represented by n because they share the same level of \u03be = \u03b3\u2191\u03b3\u2193. Furthermore, the shadow consumption rates are the same across all the three sets on q > 1. In Figure 3b, \u03ba(q) is identical on q > 1 under Sets 1 and 2 of transaction costs (whilst the difference is numerically very small on q < 1). This is not surprising since \u03ba(q) over q > 1 only depends on (\u03b3\u2191, \u03b3\u2193) via q\u2217(\u03be), (n\u03be(\u00b7))q\u2264q\u2217(\u03be) and \u03b3\n\u2193,6 and Set 1 and 2 share the same value of \u03b3\u2193. Further, when we move to the transaction cost parameters in Set 3 we find that on [1, q\u2217] the corresponding \u03ba is a multiplicative scaling of the \u03ba from Sets 1 and 2 (and this multiplicative scaling extends to the interval [q\u2217(\u03be), q\n\u2217(\u03be)] when we compare the functions \u03ba that arise in Sets 1 and 3). These properties are inherited by the map between the real and shadow portfolio weight p = p(q), where comparing the results from Sets 1 and 2, the difference in cost of purchase has no impact on the function p(q) on q > 1, and only a numerically small difference below 1), see Figure 3c.\nThe fact that the Merton ratio qM is above 1 brings new phenomena, especially concerning the location of the no-transaction region and how it varies with transaction costs. Figure 4a and 4b confirm that the sale boundary q\u2217 in shadow fractions of wealth units is totally insensitive to transaction costs (under our baseline setup with sufficiently large \u03be), while q\u2217 is decreasing in transaction costs. Moreover, since p\n\u2217 only depends on transaction costs via q\u2217(\u03be) and \u03b3\u2193, p\u2217 is totally insensitive to \u03b3\u2191 as shown in Figure 4c (recall Remark 5.9. Note also that p\u2217 is decreasing in \u03b3\u2193 and this monotonicity is opposite to that in Example 1. Further, Figure 4c and 4d show that for some parameter values qM /\u2208 [p\u2217, p\n\u2217], i.e. the Merton line is not necessarily contained in the no-transaction region, again recall Remark 5.9."

In particular we look for an expansion in terms of \u03b5\u2191 = \u03b3\u2191\u22121 and \u03b5\u2193 = 1\u2212 1\n\u03b3\u2193 .

For additive utility,Rogers [25] argued that it is natural to expect the width of the no-transaction region to be of the order of the size of the transcation cost to the power one-third. This result was formalised by Jane\u010dek and Shreve [16]. They showed (under an assumption that the transaction costs on buying and selling are identical, or in our setting that \u03b3\u2193 \u2212 1 = 1\u2212 1\n\u03b3\u2191 ), and\nunder a (almost necessary) assumption that the problem without transaction costs problem is well-posed) that p\u2217 = qM \u2212\u2206 1/3\u03b51/3 +O(\u03b52/3) and that p\u2217 = qM +\u2206 1/3\u03b51/3 +O(\u03b52/3), where \u2206 is defined below in (7.1). In general, further progress was difficult because characterisations of the value function depended on finding a solution to a non-linear second order free-boundary problem, with two free boundaries. One case that is slightly simpler is the case of logarithmic utility (which formally may be considered as the case R = 1 = S in our setting). In the case of logarithmic utility Gerhold et al [9] focus on the dual problem to give an expansion for p\u2217, p\n\u2217 to order O(\u03b52/3) and an expansion for the optimal consumption which is valid up to order O(\u03b5).\nStill in the additive case, Choi et al [5] and Hobson et al [15], showed how the problem for general transaction costs can be reduced to a first order equation. This facilitated a simpler derivation of the expansion for small transaction costs, see Choi [3] and Hobson et al [15], and these papers calculated the second order term. Choi [3] assumed zero transaction costs on selling (i.e. that \u03b3\u2193 = 1), but his results can be translated to the more general case. Hobson et al [15] additionally considered the expansion in the\n6We have \u03ba(q) = \u03b3\u2191 exp (\nS 1\u2212S\n\u222b q\nq\u2217(\u03be)\nn\u2032\u03be(v) vn\u03be(v) dv ) = 1 \u03b3\u2193 exp ( \u2212 S 1\u2212S \u222b q\u2217(\u03be) q n\u2032\u03be(v) vn\u03be(v) dv )\n. 7It is important to note that our method gives a solution which is valid for all values of transaction costs, and then we look in the small transaction cost regime. Many other studies in the small transaction cost regime only construct solutions as expansions about the frictionless case.\ncase qM = 1, in which case the width of the no transaction wedge is of order \u03b5 1/2. (We could extend our results to this case similarly). Melynyk et al [21] considered the small transaction cost case for Epstein-Zin SDU. Under some restrictions on the paramaters (which go beyond well-posedness of the problem) and under the assumption that the transaction costs on buying and selling are identical, (i.e. \u03b3\u2193 \u2212 1 = 1 \u2212 1\n\u03b3\u2191 ) they derived an\nexpansion to order \u03b52/3 for the value function and thence find expansions (again accurate to order \u03b52/3) for the boundaries of the optimal no-transaction region and the optimal consumption.\nDefine\n\u2206 = 3q2M (1\u2212 qM) 2\n4R ; (7.1)\n\u03a3 = 4mM\n3\u03c32qM(1\u2212 qM )2 = mMqM R\u03c32\u2206 ;\n\u03a8 = 1\n5 \u03a32 +\n1\n5\n(5qM \u2212 3)\nqM(1\u2212 qM ) \u03a3\u2212\n(3\u2212 10qM + 10q 2 M ) + 4RqM (1\u2212 qM )\n15q2M (1\u2212 qM ) 2\n.\nProposition 7.1.

(a) The assumption of Proposition 7.1 that either R,S < 1 and mM \u2265 0 or R,S > 1 and mM > 0 is equivalent to an assumption that the problem (4.3) is well-posed for all sufficiently small transaction cots.\n(b) In the shadow-fraction of wealth co-ordinates, the width of no-transaction region is O(\u03b51/3) and is symmetric about the Merton proportion qM . To order \u03b5\n1/3 the width of the no-transaction region depends on risk aversion R (both directly, and indirectly through qM = \u03bb \u03c3R ), but not on the elasticity of inter-temporal complementarity S.\n(c) The O(\u03b52/3) term is same for both q\u2217 and q \u2217 and moves the no-transaction region in the direction\nof smaller positions in the risky asset. This term does not depend directly on S, although it does depend indirectly on S via m\u0302.\n(d) The O(\u03b52/3) term is same for both q\u2217 and q \u2217, except that the signs are opposite, so that rather than\nmoving the no-transaction region it makes it wider or narrower. This term does not depend directly on S, although it does depend indirectly on S via m\u0302.\n(e) It is the straightforward to extend the arguments to higher order as required, or to the case qM = 1. If \u03bb = 0 = qM then the problem is degenerate and optimal strategy for the agent is to instantly eliminate any position (long or short) in the risky asset, and thereafter to keep all wealth in the bank account.\nCorollary 7.3. Suppose that R,S < 1 and mM \u2265 0 or R,S > 1 and mM > 0, and suppose that qm /\u2208 {0, 1}.

(a) In the original coordinates, the width of the no-trade region is O(\u03b51/3) and to leading order is symmetric about the Merton proportion qM . Also to leading order, the width of the notransaction region depends on risk aversion R (both directly, and indirectly through qM = \u03bb \u03c3R ), but\nnot on the elasticity of inter-temporal complementarity S. See also Jane\u010dek and Shreve [16, Remark 1] in the additive case, and Melnyk et al [21] for the corresponding result under EZ-SDU.\n(b) The O(\u03b52/3) term is same for both p\u2217 and p \u2217 and moves the no-transaction region in the direction\nof smaller positions in the risky asset. This term does not depend directly on S, although it does depend indirectly on S via m\u0302. See also [16, 21].\n(c) The individual transaction costs \u03b5\u2191 and \u03b5\u2193 only enter at linear order. The linear order term does not depend on the elasticity of inter-temporal complementarity S, except indirectly through mM . This is the final term with this property.\nProposition 7.5. Suppose that R,S < 1 and mM \u2265 0 or R,S > 1 and mM > 0, and suppose that qM /\u2208 {0, 1}. Let h3(v) = (1 + v) 2(2\u2212 v).

(a) To zeroth order consumption is equal to optimal consumption without transaction costs, and there is no term of order \u03b51/3. (See also Jane\u010dek and Shreve [16, Remark 2] in the additive case and Melnyk et al [21, Corollary 6.1] in the case of EZ-SDU.)\n(b) The first non-zero correction term is independent of p = y\u03c6x+y\u03c6 and is of order \u03b5 2/3, ([16] and [21] make\na similar observation.) It does not depend on the individual transaction costs. Mathematically, the fact that the consumption is constant arises from the fact that solutions n+(qM\u2212u) are (approximately) horizontal for small u, (since n+(qM\u2212u) has zero derivative at both endpoints where it intersects with m). Here n+(qM\u2212u) is the solution to n = O(n, q) started at (qM \u2212 u, n(qM \u2212 u) = m(qM \u2212 u)), and is defined fully in Appendix A.1.\n(c) The sign of the first non-zero correction term depends on the sign of (1 \u2212 S). If S < 1 then the agent consumes more than in the zero-transaction case; if S > 1 then the agent consume less8. At its heart, the explanation for this relationship is that given in Remark 3.5 about the impact of investing a sub-optimal fraction of wealth in the risky asset, and the effect this has on the certainty equivalent wealth of the agent. The impact of transaction costs is to cause the agent to invest a sub-optimal\n8Jane\u010dek and Shreve [16, Remark 2] and Melnyk et al [21] also make this observation. Jane\u010dek and Shreve write \u2018. . . the existence of transaction costs increases the size of consumption for R \u2208 (0, 1), while the consumption is decreased for R > 1. This is explained by the fact that the index of inter-temporal substitution, 1/R, is high for small R\u2019 \u2013 note that in their additive model R \u2261 S. However, whilst the two facts (existence of transaction costs increases (respectively decreases) consumption for R \u2208 (0, 1) (respectively R \u2208 (1,\u221e)), and the index of inter-temporal substitution 1/R is high for small R) are correct, no evidence is offered as to why the second fact is an explanation of the first, or why the sign of R\u2212 1 is critical. In the case of zero-transaction costs (and therefore also, approximately in the case of small transaction costs) the optimal consumption is mM = ( r + \u03bb 2\n2R\n)\n+ 1 S\n(\n\u03b4 \u2212 r \u2212 \u03bb 2\n2R\n)\n. Assuming that \u03b4\u2212r\u2212 \u03bb 2\n2R > 0, the primary effect of increasing S is to reduce the optimal\nconsumption, but this does not give an explanation of why the sign of consumption changes relative to the zero-transaction cost case depend on the sign of (1 \u2212 S). For this a more subtle argument is needed. Melnyk et al [21, Page 1147] point out that in the case of stochastic differential utility the elasticity of intertemporal complementarity is captured by S (and is separate to the risk aversion R) but defer to Jane\u010dek and Shreve for an explanation. We return to this issue in Section 8.3.\nfraction of wealth in the risky asset. If S < 1 the fact that the certainty equivalent value of the agent\u2019s holdings goes down (relative to the zero transaction cost case) leads the agent to increase their instantaneous consumption. When S > 1, again the presence of transaction costs causes the agent to invest a sub-optimal fraction of wealth in the risky asset. This time this leads the agent to reduce instantaneous consumption. See Section 8.3 for further development of this argument.\n(d) We expect that when R = S = 1 we recover the expansion for logarithmic utility, as studied by Gerhold et al [9]. Indeed, in this case Gerhold et al argue that the leading order correction to the optimal consumption is of order \u03b5 (and not of order \u03b52/3). Our results are consistent with this claim.\n(e) Individual transaction costs enter at O(\u03b5). This is also the first term at which the fraction p of wealth invested in the risky asset affects the consumption."

Note that although we have made no assumptions about the sign of r it is natural to assume that\nr > 0 and then r + \u03bb 2\n2R > 0. Then it is easily seen that the condition for the problem with (sufficiently)\nsmall transaction costs to be well-posed, namely S ( r + \u03bb 2\n2R\n)\n> r+ \u03bb 2 2R \u2212 \u03b4, is equivalent to S > 1\u2212 \u03b4\nr+ \u03bb 2\n2R\n.\nCorollary 8.2. Fix all the model parameters except S. Suppose that \u03b4 \u2265 r + \u03bb 2\n2R > 0. Suppose S < 1. Then the problem is always well-posed and p\u2217 and p \u2217\nare increasing in S for all levels of transaction costs. Conversely, suppose S > 1. Then p\u2217 and p \u2217 are increasing in S over the range of transaction costs for which the problem is well-posed. In particular p\u2217 and p\u2217 are increasing in S for small transaction costs.\nSuppose that r + \u03bb 2\n2R > max{\u03b4, 0}. Then the problem is well-posed for small transaction costs for\nS > max{1 \u2212 \u03b4 r+ \u03bb 2\n2R\n, 0} and then, still for small transaction costs, p\u2217 and p \u2217 are decreasing in S over this\nrange.\nEach of Figure 5 and 6 shows the two cases described in Proposition 8.1 where the monotonicity behaviours of p\u2217, p\n\u2217 can be different. To understand why different cases can arise, recall that in the frictionless case the optimal consumption rate is given by\nmM = m(qM ) = r + \u03bb2\n2R +\n\u03b4 \u2212 r \u2212 \u03bb 2\n2R\nS .\nThe sign of \u03b4 \u2212 r \u2212 \u03bb 2\n2R therefore governs whether, in the absence of transaction costs, the (constant)\noptimal consumption rate increases or decreases in S. Suppose \u03b4\u2212 r\u2212 \u03bb 2\n2R is positive. Then the agent with lower S wants to consume at a higher rate whilst maintaining a constant fraction of wealth invested in the risky asset given by the Merton ratio. As trading does not incur transaction costs, the higher level of consumption can be supported interchangeably by sale of the risky asset and/or withdrawal of cash from the risk-free account.\nWith transaction costs, we expect that the sign of \u03b4 \u2212 r \u2212 \u03bb 2\n2R affects the monotonicity of the optimal\nconsumption rate with S in a similar fashion (at least when transaction costs are small). If \u03b4 \u2212 r \u2212 \u03bb 2\n2R is positive, the agent with lower S again wants to consume more, but now such an agent will prefer to finance consumption from cash wealth rather than from sales of the risky asset because of the market frictions. Hence the agent with lower S in general has a stronger incentive to hold cash in anticipation of the need to consume more, resulting in a downward shift of the no-transaction wedge [p\u2217, p \u2217]. The opposite will happen when \u03b4 \u2212 r \u2212 \u03bb 2\n2R is negative."

            "text": "The proof of Proposition 8.3 is given in Appendix C.2.\nProposition 8.3. Suppose \u03bb > 0. Fix all the model parameters except R. Let R\u0302 > R\u0303 be such that the problems under R = R\u0302 and R = R\u0303 are well-posed where the optimal purchase and sale boundaries are (p\u0302\u2217, p\u0302 \u2217) and (p\u0303\u2217, p\u0303 \u2217) respectively. If any of the conditions in Lemma C.1 holds for R \u2208 {R\u0302, R\u0303}, then p\u0302\u2217 \u2264 p\u0303\u2217 and p\u0302 \u2217 \u2264 p\u0303\u2217. Consequently, subject to the well-posedness of the problem:\n(a) If S < 1 then p\u2217 and p \u2217 are decreasing in R for any R \u2208 (0, 1).\n(b) If S > 1 and m(0) > 0 then p\u2217 and p \u2217 are decreasing in R for R \u2208 [2,\u221e). If also \u03bb \u2265 \u03c32 then p\u2217 and\np\u2217 are decreasing in R for R \u2208 (1,\u221e).\nThe main conclusion from Proposition 8.3 is that in the typical case p\u2217 and p \u2217 are decreasing in R. This result is proven to hold over the regime where the problem is well-posed whenever R < 1 and also when R > 1 unless either m(0) \u2264 0 or R \u2208 (1, 2) and \u03bb < \u03c32 . The condition m(0) > 0 is equivalent to \u03b4 + r(S \u2212 1) < 0, which is automatically satisfied if R,S > 1 and \u03b4, r > 0. Such monotonicity behaviour of p\u2217 and p\n\u2217 in R is perhaps not too surprising in view of the fact that the Merton ratio qM = \u03bb/(R\u03c3) is decreasing in R. Nonetheless, it is useful to stress that the consumption motive will also affect p\u2217 and p \u2217 as R varies. Note that the optimal consumption rate in the frictionless case can be rewritten as\nmM = m(qM ) = r + \u03b4 \u2212 r\nS +\n\u03bb2\n2R\nS \u2212 1\nS . (8.3)\nThen for a fixed S < 1, the (frictionless) consumption rate is increasing in R. Following similar intuition to that used in Section 8.1, in the case with frictions we expect that the elevated consumption due to an increase in R will make the agent more inclined to hold cash (i.e. a smaller fraction of wealth is invested in the risky asset). This effect is in the same direction as the impact of R on the Merton ratio (when S < 1).\nHowever, if S > 1 then (8.3) suggests the optimal frictionless consumption rate is decreasing in R. The (lack of) consumption motive will then encourage the agent to hold less cash and hence the fraction of wealth invested in the risky asset becomes larger. The effect of R on the investment level through the consumption motive is therefore opposite in sign to the direct effect of R on the Merton ratio, and the net effect on the investment level becomes ambiguous. This is the reason why in the case S > 1 we require further conditions in Proposition 8.3 to be able to conclude that p\u2217 and p\n\u2217 are decreasing in R. Indeed, there exist counterexamples such that the boundaries are not decreasing in R, although usually they require somewhat extreme model parameters such as a negative discount rate in conjunction with very high transaction costs.

            "text": "In this section we give three related arguments which together justify the comments made in Remarks 3.5 and 7.6(c).\nConsider the continuous-time investment-consumption problem for EZ-SDU in the frictionless case. Suppose the agent uses constant proportional strategies so that the value function is as given in (3.6) where H is as given in (3.5), i.e.\nH(q,m) = \u03b4 + (S \u2212 1)\n(\nr \u2212m+ \u03bb\u03c3q \u2212 1\n2 q2\u03c32R\n)\n.\nThen, provided H(q,m) > 0, and with z = x+ y\u03b8 denoting initial wealth, V0 = z1\u2212R\n1\u2212R\n(\nm1\u2212S\nH(q,m)\n)\u03b8 . Maximis-\ning V0 is equivalent to maximising ((1 \u2212R)V0) 1\n1\u2212R = z m H(q,m) 1 1\u2212S . Note that this quantity is expressed in\neconomically meaningful units as it represents the certainty equivalent value. As in Section 3.1, suppose that the fraction of wealth invested in the risky asset is constrained to be equal to q, where q is fixed and given, and possibly suboptimal, and consider choosing the optimal consumption rate. The maximum certainty equivalent can be found by differentiation and we get that the optimal consumption rate m is given by m = m(q) and solves 1m = Hm(q,m) (1\u2212S)H(q,m) . Since Hm(q,m) = (1\u2212S) this simplifies to m(q) = H(q,m(q)), so that m(q) is the root of the decreasing (in m) function hq where hq(m) = H(q,m)\u2212m.\nSuppose S < 1. Then H(q,m) has a minimum in q at qM (independent of the value of m). In particular, for q 6= qM , 0 = hq(m(q)) = H(q,m(q)) \u2212m(q) > H(qM ,m(q)) \u2212m(q) = hqM (m(q)) (where the strict inequality follows from the strict convexity of H in q). Then, since hqM is decreasing we must\nhave m(qM ) < m(q). In particular, m(\u00b7) has a minimum at qM . Conversely, suppose S > 1 so that H(q,m) has a maximum in q at qM . Then, 0 = hq(m(q)) = H(q,m(q))\u2212m(q) \u2265 H(qM ,m(q))\u2212m(q) = hqM (m(q)) and since hqM is decreasing we must have m(qM ) \u2265 m(q). In particular, m(\u00b7) has a maximum at qM (and the uniqueness of the minimiser follows from the uniqueness of the maximiser of H in q as before).\nIt follows that (in the zero-transaction cost case) when S < 1 the impact of using a non-optimal investment strategy, and then optimising over consumption is to increase the immediate consumption rate relative to the optimal consumption rate under an optimal investment strategy. When S > 1, the impact of using a non-optimal investment strategy, and then optimising over consumption is to decrease the immediate consumption rate.\nOne impact of transaction costs is to force the agent to use a suboptimal investment strategy when compared with the frictionless world. The above analysis then explains whether the impact of transaction costs on the consumption rate is to increase or decrease instantaneous consumption (relative to the frictionless case) and why this depends exactly on the shape of H(q,m(q)) (does it have a minimum or a maximum at qM) which in turn is directly related to the sign of (S \u2212 1).\nThe above argument might be considered a mathematical justification of the role of (S \u2212 1) in determining the impact of the introduction of transaction costs on consumption, but it does not directly relate to the economic explanation of the fundamental role of S\u22121 given in Remark 3.5 in terms of the interplay between two impacts of reducing the certainty equivalent value of future consumption. To understand what is happening at a more fundamental level, we consider recursive utility over one time period.\nConsider an agent in a one-period economy (with times 0 and 1) containing a risk-less asset and a risky asset. The agent has initial wealth x and recursive preferences. The time-0 controls available to the agent are to decide the amount c \u2208 (0, 1) to consume at t = 0, and the number of units \u03c6 of the risky asset to hold between times 0 and 1. We assume that the price of the risk-less asset is normalised so that it is constant over time, that the initial price of the risky asset is 1 and that the return on the risky asset is given by the time-1 measurable random variable Z (so that 1 invested in the risky asset at time 0 yields (1+Z) at time-1). It follows that the wealth of the agent at time 1 (we assume no frictions) is x\u2212 c+\u03c6Z. We assume that all wealth at time 1 is consumed at time 1.\nUnder quasi-arithmetic recursive preferences, the aim of the agent is to maximise the certainty equivalent value\nf\u22121 ( f(c) + f \u25e6 g\u22121 (E[g(x\u2212 c+ \u03c6Z)]) )\n(8.4)\nwhere f and g are increasing, concave functions. The example to consider is f(z) = z 1\u2212S 1\u2212S and g(z) = z1\u2212R 1\u2212R in which case the recursive utility is precisely the discrete-time (one-period) analogue of the EZ-SDU we are considering in the main body of the paper.\nWe specialise to the case of g(z) = z 1\u2212R 1\u2212R , but leave f general. Then, with w = \u03c6 x\u2212c we find\ng\u22121 (E[g(x\u2212 c+ \u03c6Z)]) = (x\u2212 c)D(w) where D(w) = g\u22121(E[g(1 + wZ)]) = ( E [ (1 + wZ)1\u2212R ]) 1 1\u2212R . Then maximising (8.4) simplifies to first maximising D with respect to w, and then with w\u0302 = argmaxD(w), maximising\nf\u22121 (f(c) + f ((x\u2212 c)D(w\u0302)))\nWe can also consider the problem of maximising the certainty equivalent value for a given investment strategy. Suppose w (and therefore D = D(w)) is fixed. Then, since f is increasing, it is sufficient to maximise f(c) + f(D(x \u2212 c)). Assuming differentiability of f (and an interior maximum, for which a sufficient condition is f \u2032(0) = \u221e) the maximiser c\u0302 = c\u0302(x,D) solves\nf \u2032(c) = Df \u2032(D(x\u2212 c)) = 1\n(x\u2212 c) [yf \u2032(y)]\n\u2223 \u2223\ny=D(x\u2212c) . (8.5)\nWe want to consider the impact of changing D, and it is clear that this depends on whether yf \u2032(y) is increasing or decreasing in y. By the concavity of f , the left expression of (8.5) is decreasing in c and the middle expression is increasing in c. Therefore, if yf \u2032(y) is increasing in y then c\u0302(x,D) is decreasing\nin D; conversely, if yf \u2032(y) is decreasing in y then c\u0302(x,D) is increasing in D. For f(z) = z 1\u2212S\n1\u2212S , zf \u2032(z) is\ndecreasing precisely when S > 1, so that c\u0302(x,D) is increasing in D if and only if S > 19. Finally we combine this argument with the impact of using a sub-optimal investment strategy as in the continuous-time case: if w\u2217 is optimal then D(w) < D(w\u2217) and optimal consumption in markets with frictions is lower than in the frictionless case if and only if S > 1.\nThe third argument is related to Remark 3.5 and connects the above analysis to the impact of 1/S as a measure of the inter-temporal substitutability of consumption \u2013 high S indicates a strong preference for smooth consumption over time. Consider the first equality in (8.5). D enters into the expression Df \u2032(D(x \u2212 c)) twice. First, the factor D means that decreasing D lowers the expression, resulting in higher optimal consumption. This role for D is related to the impact of changes of future wealth on consumption and is independent of the preferences expressed via f . Second D is an argument of the factor f \u2032(D(x\u2212 c)) \u2013 here lowering D increases the marginal time-1 utility and therefore, in isolation, decreases time-0 consumption. This factor depends on the preferences via f \u2032 and is strongest when S is large. Thus, when S is small, the first effect dominates and using suboptimal investment strategies leads to increased consumption. When S is large, the desire for smooth consumption increases, the second effect dominates, and time-0 consumption falls."

            "text": "In this paper we studied the optimal investment-consumption problem over the infinite horizon in a Black\u2013Scholes\u2013Merton financial market. Relative to the standard frictionless case first investigated by Merton [22, 23], the innovations are that we consider proportional transaction costs and non-additive preferences, as captured by Epstein\u2013Zin stochastic differential utility. Our results determine when the problem is well-posed, and in this case, we give a complete description of the optimal investment and consumption strategies. A major innovation is our focus on the shadow fraction of wealth in the risky asset: it turns out that with this as the primary variable, the problem reduces to the study of a freeboundary problem for one-dimensional, singular ODE.\nEven for additive (CRRA) preferences (studied first by Magill and Constantinides [19] and Davis and Norman [6]) our approach brings substantial simplifications and insights, and we are able give new (financial) interpretations to many of the quantities which arise.\nThe non-additive case brings extra technical challenges (especially as regards existence and uniqueness of the utility process associated with a given consumption stream, and the comparison theorem used to facilitate the verification lemma); we overcome these challenges by making use of previous results in the frictionless case, see [12].\nStudy of the non-additive case is increasingly important as there is mounting evidence that the additive case fails to accurately describe investor behaviour. This paper is the first to give a full solution of the problem in the non-additive case (previous results only covered the small transaction cost case and only for an incomplete set of parameter combinations) and therefore is the first to make it possible to properly study the comparative statics of the problem and to distinguish the separate roles played by the risk aversion (which primarily affects the width and location of the no-transaction wedge), and the elasticity of intertemporal complementarity (which primarily affects the consumption rate).\nThe methods of this paper rely crucially on scaling properties of the problem (including the dynamics of the price process, the proportional transaction costs and the form of the recursive utility) to reduce the dimensionality, and it looks difficult to extend them beyond this case. Notwithstanding, looking at the extant literature in the additive case, it seems that there are at least two natural extensions which would become tractable for SDU using the methods of this paper.\n9Alternatively for f(z) = z 1\u2212S\n1\u2212S of power law form, c\u0302 solves c\u2212S = D1\u2212S(x \u2212 c)1\u2212S . It follows that c\u0302 = D1\u2212 1 S x which is\nincreasing in D if and only if S > 1.\nThe first extension is the problem with infinite transaction costs (and then it is important to distinguish between infinite transaction costs on selling and infinite transaction costs on buying), which is a precursor to an expansion solution for problems with a large transaction parameter. The case R,S > 1 and m(0) < 0 < m(1) seems especially interesting as the point where \u2113 crosses zero becomes a singular point for the solution n\u221e.\nThe second extension is the problem with multiple assets. At the general level, with transaction costs to be paid on all exchanges of assets (perhaps also requiring all transactions to be made to or from the cash account) the intuition is that the no-transaction region becomes a no-transaction cone, see for example Chen and Dai [2]. However, whereas in the one-risky asset case, the no-trade region is an interval which can be characterised by its endpoints, in the multi-asset case, the cross-section of the no-transaction region will be convex, but otherwise may be complicated in shape and difficult to characterise. However, results in the additive case (especially Hobson et al [14] and Choi [4]) give hope that it is possible to find a complete solution in a problem with multiple risky assets in which transaction costs are levied on purchases and sales of one asset only. Following the approach of this paper, the aim is to reduce the problem via the shadow fraction of wealth to the solution of a free-boundary problem for a first order differential equation. We even expect that apart from special cases, the resulting ODE is simpler than that in the single asset case studied in this paper in that there is no singularity at 1.\nThese extensions and other related problems are left as future work."

Complete proofs are omitted but a structurally identical family of first order ODEs is studied in [15], Section 3. See also Section 3.5 of [28] and Section 5 of [14] for the analysis of a similar problem in the context of optimal investment and consumption under proportional transaction costs with multiple assets.\nProof of Proposition 5.3. We only establish (a) \u2013 (f) for the case qM \u2208 (0, 1), the argument for the other three cases is similar.\nFirst, we show existence of q\u2217(\u03be), q \u2217(\u03be) and n\u03be. For z \u2208 {m > 0} \u2229 (0, qM ), define \u03b6 +(z) \u2208 {m > 0} \u2229 (qM , 1) and the function n + (z) : [z, \u03b6 +(z)] \u2192 [m(z),m(\u03b6+(z))] as in Propositions A.1(a) or A.2(a), i.e. n+(z) solves n \u2032 = O(n, q) subject to n+(z)(z) = m(z), and then crosses m at \u03b6 +(z). Further, define the map \u03a3+ : {m > 0} \u2229 (0, qM ) \u2192 (1,\u221e) by\n\u03a3+(z) := exp\n(\n\u222b \u03b6+(z)\nz \u2212\n1\nq(1\u2212 q)\nm(q)\u2212 n+ (z) (q)\n\u2113(q)\u2212 n+(z)(q) dq\n)\nSince \u03be is in the well-posedness range of transaction costs and the function \u03a3+ is increasing and continuous, it follows from Propositions A.1(a) or A.2(a) that there exists a unique z \u2208 {m > 0} \u2229 (0, qM ) such that \u03a3+(z) = \u03be. Set q\u2217(\u03be) := z, q \u2217(\u03be) := \u03b6+(z) and n\u03be := n + (z). Then it follows from Propositions A.1(a) or A.2(a) that n\u03be satisfies properties (a) \u2013 (f). Uniqueness follows since \u03a3 + is strictly increasing.\nFinally, we establish (5.5) and(5.6). We only provide the argument for (5.5) and for the case qM > 0: the argument for (5.6) or for qM < 0 is similar.\nSuppose 0 < q\u2217 \u2264 1. Then (\u03be \u2212 1)(q\u2217)2 \u2264 (\u03be \u2212 1)q\u2217 which can be rewritten as q\u2217(1 + (\u03be \u2212 1)q\u2217) \u2264 \u03beq\u2217. Then q\u2217 < qM \u2264 q \u2217 \u2264 \u03beq \u2217 (1+(\u03be\u22121)q\u2217) . Similarly if q\u2217 \u2264 1 < q \u2217 then 1 + (\u03be \u2212 1)q\u2217 < q\u2217 + (\u03be \u2212 1)q\u2217 = \u03beq\u2217 so that q\u2217 \u2264 1 < \u03beq\u2217 (1+(\u03be\u22121)q\u2217) . Finally, the non-trivial case is when 1 < q\u2217 < qM < q \u2217. Then on (q\u2217(\u03be), q \u2217(\u03be)), n\u03be \u2265 m \u2265 \u2113 if R < 1 and n\u03be \u2264 m \u2264 \u2113 if R > 1. In either case, this implies that 0 < m(q)\u2212n\u03be(q) l(q)\u2212n\u03be(q) < 1 on (q\u2217(\u03be), q\u2217(\u03be)). This together with (5.4) gives\nln(\u03be) <\n\u222b q\u2217(\u03be)\nq\u2217(\u03be)\n1\nq(q \u2212 1) dq = log\nq\u2217(\u03be)\u2212 1\nq\u2217(\u03be) \u2212 log\nq\u2217(\u03be)\u2212 1\nq\u2217(\u03be)\nRearranging terms yields the first inequality in (5.5). The second inequality is trivial.\nThe following corollary is useful in the study of the ill-posed case.\nCorollary A.3. Suppose \u03be \u2208 (1,\u221e). Suppose R < 1. Then lim\u03be\u2193\u03be infq\u2208[q\u2217(\u03be),q\u2217(\u03be)] n\u03be(q) = 0. Suppose R < 1. Then lim\u03be\u2193\u03be infq\u2208[q\u2217(\u03be),q\u2217(\u03be)] n\u03be(q) = 0.\nProof. This follows from the fact that \u03a3+ is increasing and continuous.\nProof of Corollary 5.4. Uniqueness of \u03ba\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 follows from standard ODE theory, using the (double) boundary condition in (5.8).\nTo establish existence and argue the remaining claims, define \u03ba\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 : [q\u2217(\u03be), q \u2217(\u03be)] \u2192 (0,\u221e) by\n\u03ba\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(q) := \u03b3 \u2191 exp\n(\nS\n1\u2212 S\n\u222b q\nq\u2217(\u03be)\nn\u2032\u03be(v)\nvn\u03be(v) dv\n)\n= 1\n\u03b3\u2193 exp\n(\n\u2212 S\n1\u2212 S\n\u222b q\u2217(\u03be)\nq\nn\u2032\u03be(v)\nvn\u03be(v) dv\n)\n, (A.1)\nwhere the equality in (A.1) follows from the integral constraint (5.4) for n\u03be and the fact that \u03b3 \u2191\u03b3\u2193 = \u03be. Then \u03ba\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 is well-defined (since 0 /\u2208 [q\u2217(\u03be), q \u2217(\u03be)]) and satisfies (5.8). Moreover, \u03ba\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 is continuously differentiable with derivative\n\u03ba\u2032\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(q) = S\n1\u2212 S\nn\u2032\u03be(q)\nqn\u03be(q) \u03ba\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(q). (A.2)\nPlugging in q\u2217(\u03be) and q \u2217(\u03be) and using (5.3) gives (5.9). Moreover, using the the ODE (5.2) for n, we obtain that \u03ba\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 satisfies the ODE (5.7) on [q\u2217(\u03be), q \u2217(\u03be)] \\ {1}. Finally, using that (1 \u2212 R) and (1 \u2212 S) have the same sign and that (1\u2212R)n\u03be is decreasing by Proposition 5.3(b), (A.2) directly yields (a). The additional claim is straightforward, given (A.1).\nA.2 No-transaction region\nWe proceed to list some properties of the M\u00f6bius transformations \u03c4c(q) for c \u2208 (0,\u221e) and q \u2208 R \u222a {\u221e}. First, for fixed c, \u03c4c is continuously differentiable and strictly increasing on (\u221e,\n1 1\u2212c = \u03c4 1c (\u221e)) and ( 11\u2212c =\n\u03c4 1 c (\u221e),\u221e). Moreover, for fixed q, \u03c4c is also continuously differentiable with respect to the parameter c. For future reference, we note that for q \u2208 R \\ { 11\u2212c , 0, 1},\n\u03c4 \u2032c(q) = \u03c4c(q)(1\u2212 \u03c4c(q))\nq(1\u2212 q) , (A.3)\n\u2202\n\u2202c \u03c4c(q) =\n1 c \u03c4c(q)(1 \u2212 \u03c4c(q)). (A.4)\nProof of Lemma 5.8. If, for example, qM \u2208 (0, 1) then the inequalities follow easily since, by the properties of \u03c4c on (0, 1), p\u2217(\u03b3\n\u2191, \u03b3\u2193) = \u03c4 1 \u03b3\u2191 (q\u2217(\u03be)) \u2264 q\u2217(\u03be) < qM < q \u2217(\u03be) \u2264 \u03c4\u03b3\u2193(q \u2217(\u03be)) = p\u2217(\u03b3 \u2191, \u03b3\u2193). The result for\nqM = 1 is very similar. For other values of qM the result is a little more subtle. We consider the case when qM > 1, the case qM < 0 is similar and omitted. If q\u2217 \u2264 1 we have p\u2217(\u03b3 \u2191, \u03b3\u2193) \u2264 1 < \u03c4\u03b3\u2193(q\n\u2217(\u03be)) = p\u2217(\u03b3\u2191, \u03b3\u2193). So, suppose 1 < q\u2217 < qM . By the final result of Proposition 5.3 we have\nq\u2217(\u03be) < \u03beq\u2217(\u03be)\n1 + (\u03be \u2212 1)q\u2217(\u03be) = \u03c4\u03be(q\n\u2217(\u03be)).\nThen p\u2217(\u03b3 \u2191, \u03b3\u2193) = \u03c4 1 \u03b3\u2191 (q\u2217(\u03be)) < \u03c4 1 \u03b3\u2191 \u25e6 \u03c4\u03be(q \u2217(\u03be)) = \u03c4\u03b3\u2193(q \u2217(\u03be)) = p\u2217(\u03b3\u2191, \u03b3\u2193).\nFor the final inequality in the case qM > 1 note that in the case R < 1, since n\u03be is decreasing on (q\u2217(\u03be)\u2228 1, q \u2217(\u03be)) and m is a quadratic with minimum at qM , we must have q \u2217(\u03be)\u2212 qM < qM \u2212 (1\u2228 q\u2217(\u03be)). In particular, q\u2217(\u03be) < 2qM \u2212 1 and p \u2217(\u03b3\u2191, \u03b3\u2193) = \u03c4\u03b3\u2193(q\n\u2217(\u03be)) < \u03c4\u03b3\u2193(2qM \u2212 1). The argument for R > 1 is very similar.\nProof of Proposition5.10. Uniqueness of q\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 follows from standard ODE theory, using the (double) boundary conditions in (b).\nTo establish existence of q\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 , we first define its inverse function. Motivated by (4.5), we let p\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 : [q\u2217(\u03be), q \u2217(\u03be)] \u2192 R be given by\np\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(q) := q\n\u03ba\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(q) + (1\u2212 \u03ba\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(q))q = \u03c4 1 \u03ba \u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 (q) (q).\nThe boundary conditions (5.8) of \u03ba\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 give\np\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(q\u2217(\u03be)) = \u03c4 1 \u03b3\u2191 (q\u2217(\u03be)) = p\u2217(\u03b3\n\u2191, \u03b3\u2193) and p\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(q \u2217(\u03be)) = \u03c4\u03b3\u2193(q\u2217(\u03be)) = p \u2217(\u03b3\u2191, \u03b3\u2193),\nand the fact that \u03c4c(1) = 1 for all c \u2208 (0,\u221e), gives p\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(1) = 1 if 1 \u2208 [q\u2217(\u03be), q \u2217(\u03be)]. Moreover, p\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 is continuously differentiable because \u03ba\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 is. Using (A.3) and (A.4), the ODE (5.7) for \u03ba, and the simple identity\np(1\u2212 p) q(1\u2212 q) = m(p)\u2212 \u2113(p) m(q)\u2212 \u2113(q) , p \u2208 R, q \u2208 R \\ {0, 1},\nwe obtain for q \u2208 [q\u2217(\u03be), q \u2217(\u03be)] \\ {1},\np\u2032\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(q) = p\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(q)(1\u2212 p\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(q))\nq(1\u2212 q) \u2212\np\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(q)(1 \u2212 p\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(q))\nq(1\u2212 q)\nm(q)\u2212 n\u03be(q)\n\u2113(q)\u2212 n\u03be(q)\n= p\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(q)(1\u2212 p\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(q))\nq(1\u2212 q)\n\u2113(q)\u2212m(q) \u2113(q)\u2212 n\u03be(q) (A.5)\n= \u2113(p\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(q))\u2212m(p\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(q))\n\u2113(q)\u2212 n\u03be(q) .\nLooking at (A.5) shows that p\u2032 \u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 is positive. Indeed, the first factor in (A.5) coincides by (A.3) with \u03c4 \u2032c(q) for c = 1\n\u03ba \u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193\n(q) and is therefore positive; the second factor is also positive because n\u03be and \u2113 both\nlie on the same side of m on (q\u2217(\u03be), q \u2217(\u03be)) \\ {1}. Thus, p\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 is strictly increasing and maps [q\u2217(\u03be), q \u2217(\u03be)] onto [p\u2217(\u03b3 \u2191, \u03b3\u2193), p\u2217(\u03b3\u2191, \u03b3\u2193)]. If we now define the function q\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 : [q\u2217(\u03be), q \u2217(\u03be)] \u2192 [q\u2217(\u03be), q \u2217(\u03be)] by q\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 := p\u22121 \u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 , then q\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 satisfies (a) to (c). (Note that since \u03c4c(1) = 1 for all c we immediately get p\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 = 1 whence q\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(1) = 1 also.)\nFinally, if \u03b3\u0303\u2193, \u03b3\u0303\u2191 \u2208 [1,\u221e) are such that \u03b3\u0303\u2193\u03b3\u0303\u2191 = \u03be, then \u03b3\u0303 \u2193 \u03b3\u2193 = \u03b3 \u2191 \u03b3\u0303\u2191 and it suffices to show that the function\nq\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 \u25e6 \u03c4 \u03b3\u0303\u2193 \u03b3\u2193 satisfies properties (a) - (c). For (a), this follows from the ODE (5.12) for q\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 and (A.3)\nA.3 The candidate value function and candidate optimal strategy\nWe first collect some properties of the extended functions n\u03be and \u03ba\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 and q\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 . The following result follows directly from Proposition 5.3, Corollary 5.4 and Proposition 5.10 together with Definition 5.11.\nProposition A.4.

First, it follows from the continuous differentiability of n\u03be, \u03ba\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 and q\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 that V\u0302 \u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 is continuously differentiable with respect to all its arguments. Moreover, dropping the references to \u03b3\u2191, \u03b3\u2193 and \u03be and the arguments for simplicity and using Proposition A.4(a), we obtain\nV\u0302t = \u2212\u03b4\u03b8V\u0302 , (A.10) V\u0302x = (1 \u2212R)V\u0302 1\nx+ \u03c6y\u03ba(q) (A.11)\nV\u0302\u03c6 = (1 \u2212R)V\u0302 y\u03ba(q)\nx+ \u03c6y\u03ba(q) , (A.12)\nV\u0302y = (1 \u2212R)V\u0302 \u03c6\u03ba(q)\nx+ \u03c6y\u03ba(q) = (1\u2212R)V\u0302\nq y (A.13)\nNext, it follows from the continuous differentiability of n\u03be and \u03ba\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 and q\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 and (A.13) that V\u0302 \u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 is twice continuously differentiable with respect to y. Again dropping the references to \u03b3\u2191, \u03b3\u2193 and \u03be and the\narguments, and using that V\u0302q = 0 we obtain\ny2V\u0302yy = V\u0302 (1\u2212R)q((1\u2212R)q \u2212 1) + (1\u2212R)V\u0302 y \u2202p\n\u2202y\n\u2202q\n\u2202p\n= \u2212R(1\u2212R)V\u0302 q2 + V\u0302 (1\u2212R)\n(\np(1\u2212 p) \u2202q\n\u2202p \u2212 q(1\u2212 q)\n)\nIn summary, we have\ny2V\u0302yy =\n\n\n\n\u2212R(1\u2212R)V\u0302 q2 if \u03c6yx+\u03c6y \u2208 (\u03c4 1 \u03b3\u2191 (\u221e), p\u2217(\u03b3 \u2191, \u03b3\u2193)) \u222a (p\u2217(\u03b3\u2191, \u03b3\u2193), \u03c4\u03b3\u2193(\u221e)), \u2212R(1\u2212R)V\u0302 q2 + 2\u03b8S \u03c32 V\u0302 (m(q)\u2212 n(q)) if \u03c6yx+\u03c6y \u2208 [p\u2217(\u03b3 \u2191, \u03b3\u2193), p\u2217(\u03b3\u2191, \u03b3\u2193)].\n(A.14) (a) This follows directly from (A.11) and (A.12).

Then (x+ x \u2032, y, \u03c6+ \u03c6\u2032) \u2208 S \u25e6 (\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193) and\nV\u0302 \u03b3 \u2191,\u03b3\u2193(x+ x\u2032, y, \u03c6+ \u03c6\u2032) \u2265 V\u0302 \u03b3 \u2191,\u03b3\u2193(x, y, \u03c6).\n(b) If (x\u2032, y, \u03c6\u2032) \u2208 S \u25e6 \u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 is such that x\u2032 := x\u2212\u03b3\u2191y(\u03c6\u2032\u2212\u03c6)++ y \u03b3\u2193 (\u03c6\u2032\u2212\u03c6)\u2212 (corresponding to an initial bulk\ntrade), then V\u0302 \u03b3 \u2191,\u03b3\u2193(t, x, y, \u03c6) \u2265 V\u0302 \u03b3 \u2191,\u03b3\u2193(t, x\u2032, y, \u03c6\u2032). Moreover, the inequality is an equality if either \u03c6y x+\u03c6y < p\u2217(\u03b3 \u2191, \u03b3\u2193) and \u03c6 \u2032y x+\u03c6\u2032y = p\u2217(\u03b3 \u2191, \u03b3\u2193) or \u03c6yx+\u03c6y > p\u2217(\u03b3 \u2191, \u03b3\u2193) and \u03c6 \u2032y x+\u03c6\u2032y = p\u2217(\u03b3 \u2191, \u03b3\u2193).\nProof. (a) First, it follows from the definition of S\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 and S \u25e6 \u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 that x+ \u03b5x\u2032, y, \u03c6+ \u03b5\u03c6\u2032 \u2208 S \u25e6 \u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 for all \u03b5 \u2208 [0, 1]. Hence, it suffices to show that x\u2032V\u0302 \u03b3 \u2191,\u03b3\u2193 x (x+ \u03b5x\u2032, y, \u03c6+ \u03b5\u03c6\u2032)+\u03c6\u2032V\u0302 \u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 \u03c6 (x+ \u03b5x \u2032, y, \u03c6+ \u03b5\u03c6\u2032) \u2265 0 for all \u03b5 \u2208 [0, 1]. So fix \u03b5 \u2208 [0, 1]. Then by Proposition A.5(a) and the definition of S\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 ,\nx\u2032V\u0302 \u03b3 \u2191,\u03b3\u2193 x (x+ \u03b5x \u2032, y, \u03c6+ \u03b5\u03c6\u2032) + \u03c6\u2032V\u0302 \u03b3 \u2191,\u03b3\u2193 \u03c6 (x+ \u03b5x \u2032, y, \u03c6+ \u03b5\u03c6\u2032)\n= V \u03b3 \u2191,\u03b3\u2193 x (x+ \u03b5x \u2032, s, \u03c6+ \u03b5\u03c6\u2032)\n(\nx\u2032 + \u03c6\u2032y\u03ba\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 ( q\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 ( (\u03c6+ \u03b5\u03c6\u2032)y\nx+ \u03b5x\u2032 + (\u03c6+ \u03b5\u03c6\u2032)y\n))\n)\n\u2265 0.\nwhere we use that if \u03c6\u2032 > 0 then x\u2032 + \u03c6\u2032y\u03ba(q) \u2265 x\u2032 + \u03c6 \u2032y \u03b3\u2191 \u2265 0 since (x\u2032, y, \u03c6\u2032) \u2208 S\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 and if \u03c6 \u2032 < 0 then x\u2032 + \u03c6\u2032y\u03ba(q) \u2265 x\u2032 + \u03c6\u2032y\u03b3\u2193 \u2265 0 again since (x\u2032, y, \u03c6\u2032) \u2208 S\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 .\n(b) We only consider the case that \u03c6\u2032 > \u03c6, the case \u03c6\u2032 < \u03c6 is similar. Then x\u2032 = x \u2212 \u03b3\u2191(\u03c6\u2032 \u2212 \u03c6)y Define the function \u03b5 : [0, 1] \u2192 (0,\u221e) by f(\u03b5) = V \u03b3 \u2191,\u03b3\u2193(t, (1 \u2212 \u03b5)x + \u03b5x\u2032, y, (1 \u2212 \u03b5)\u03c6 + \u03b5\u03c6\u2032). Then f(0) = V\u0302 \u03b3 \u2191,\u03b3\u2193(t, x, y, \u03c6) and f(1) = V\u0302 \u03b3\n\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(t, x\u2032, y, \u03c6\u2032). It suffices to show that f \u2032(\u03b5) \u2264 0 and f \u2032(\u03b5) = 0 if \u03c6y\nx+\u03c6y < \u03c6\u2032y x+\u03c6\u2032y = p\u2217(\u03b3 \u2191, \u03b3\u2193). Dropping the arguments for simplicity, the claim follows from part (a) via\nf \u2032(\u03b5) = V\u0302 \u03b3 \u2191,\u03b3\u2193 x (x \u2032 \u2212 x) + V\u0302 \u03b3 \u2191,\u03b3\u2193 \u03c6 (\u03c6 \u2032 \u2212 \u03c6) = \u2212V\u0302 \u03b3 \u2191,\u03b3\u2193 x y\u03b3 \u2191(\u03c6\u2032 \u2212 \u03c6) + V\u0302 \u03b3 \u2191,\u03b3\u2193 \u03c6 (\u03c6 \u2032 \u2212 \u03c6)\n= V\u0302 \u03b3 \u2191,\u03b3\u2193 x y(\u03c6 \u2032 \u2212 \u03c6)\n(\n\u03ba\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 ( q\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193 ( ((1\u2212 \u03b5)\u03c6+ \u03b5\u03c6\u2032)y\n(1\u2212 \u03b5)x+ \u03b5x\u2032 + ((1\u2212 \u03b5)\u03c6+ \u03b5\u03c6\u2032)y\n)) \u2212 \u03b3\u2191 ) .\nProof of Theorem 5.13. For better readability, we are going to drop the subscripts and arguments \u03be and \u03b3\u2191, \u03b3\u2193. For future reference define\naQ(q) = 2S\n\u03c3(1\u2212 S) (\u2113(q)\u2212 n(q)) = \u03c3\n\u2113(q)\u2212 n\u03be(q)\nD ;\nbQ(q) = q (n(q)\u2212 2\u03b8S{\u2113(q)\u2212 n(q)}) ,\nso that dQ\u0302t = aQ(Q\u0302t) dBt + bQ(Q\u0302t) dt+ dG \u2191 t \u2212 dG \u2193 t .\n(a) Existence and uniqueness of a solution to (5.14) follows from standard results on reflecting onedimensional diffusions, see, for example, [27, Theorem 4.1]. The additional claim is trivial on J0, \u03c4J. For the argument on J\u03c4,\u221eJ, first note that aQ(1) = 0 and bQ(1) = n\u03be(1) > 0 by Proposition 5.3(e) and the fact that m(1) = \u2113(1).\nIf q = 1, then Q\u0302\u03c4 = 1 on {\u03c4 < \u221e} since Q\u0302 \u2208 [q\u2217, q \u2217]. Moreover, it is not difficult to check that\ndGt = bQ(1) dt if t \u2265 \u03c4 , and the process Q\u0302 remains constant on J\u03c4,\u221eJ.\nBy contrast, if q\u2217 > 1, then Q\u0302t > 1 on {\u03c4 < t} by Feller\u2019s boundary test for diffusions (see e.g. [17, Proposition 5.5.22 (a)]) since bQ(q) > 0 and aQ(q) = O(1 \u2212 q) in a neighbourhood of 1 because \u2113\n\u2032(1) \u2212 n\u2032\u03be(1) = \u2113 \u2032(1) \u2212m\u2032(1) 6= 0 by Proposition (5.14)(e) and the fact that qM 6= 1.\n(b) Let (\u03a6\u0302, C\u0302, X\u0302) be defined as in the statement of the proposition. First, we argue that we cannot have both \u03c6y\u03b3\u2191(1\u2212q\u2217) < q\u2217x and \u03c6y \u03b3\u2193 (1\u2212q\u2217) > q\u2217x. We argue this in the case q\u2217, q \u2217 > 0; the case q\u2217, q \u2217 < 0 is similar, but easier. If q\u2217, q\n\u2217 > 0 then it is sufficient to show that \u03b3\u2191 (1\u2212q\u2217)q\u2217 > 1 \u03b3\u2193 (1\u2212q\u2217) q\u2217 . If 0 < q\u2217 \u2264 1 < q \u2217 then this\nis immediate, and if 0 < q\u2217 < q \u2217 \u2264 1 it follows from the fact that 1\u2212qq is decreasing on (0, 1] and then\n1 \u03b3\u2193 (1\u2212q\u2217) q\u2217 \u2264 (1\u2212q\u2217) q\u2217 < (1\u2212q\u2217) q\u2217 \u2264 \u03b3\u2191 (1\u2212q\u2217)q\u2217 . Finally, if 1 \u2264 q\u2217 < q \u2217 the result follows from \u03be < (q \u2217\u22121) q\u2217 q\u2217) (q\u2217\u22121)\nas shown in the proof of Proposition 5.3.\nNow consider (\u03a6\u03020, X\u03020). If both \u03c6y \u03b3\u2193 (1 \u2212 q\u2217) \u2264 q\u2217x and q\u2217x \u2264 \u03c6y\u03b3 \u2191(1 \u2212 q\u2217) then \u03a6\u03020 = \u03c6 and using\n\u03ba\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(q) = q(1\u2212p) (1\u2212q)p and p = \u03c6x x+\u03c6y we find X\u03020 = 1\u2212Q\u03020 Q\u03020 Y0\u03ba\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(Q\u03020)\u03a6\u03020 = (1\u2212p) p y\u03c6 = x. In particular, (\u03a6\u03020, X\u03020) = (\u03c6, x) and X\u03020 trivially satisfies the initial condition (2nd unlabelled equation in Section 4).\nIf \u03c6y \u03b3\u2193 (1\u2212 q\u2217) > q\u2217x or if q\u2217x > \u03c6y\u03b3 \u2191(1\u2212 q\u2217) then we have to account for the initial re-balancing of the portfolio. We describe what happens in the latter case, the details for the former case are similar.\nSuppose \u03c6y\u03b3\u2191(1 \u2212 q\u2217) < q\u2217x. In this case \u03a6\u03020 = q\u2217\n(\n\u03c6+ x y\u03b3\u2191\n)\n> \u03c6 and Q\u03020 = q\u2217. Then from X\u03020 =\n1\u2212q\u2217 q\u2217 y\u03b3\u2191q\u2217\n(\n\u03c6+ x y\u03b3\u2191\n)\nwe find X\u03020 = x\u2212 q\u2217\n( \u03a6\u03020 \u2212 \u03c6 ) . In particular X\u03020 satisfies the initial condition (4.2).\nRewriting (5.15) we find that Q\u0302 solves\nQ\u0302t = Yt\u03ba\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(Q\u0302t)\u03a6\u0302t\nX\u0302t + Yt\u03ba\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(Q\u0302t)\u03a6\u0302t ,\nand hence that, provided X\u0302 represents the cash wealth of the agent (and \u03ba\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(Q\u0302) is the relative shadow price), Q\u0302 solves (5.16) and has the interpretation as the shadow fraction of wealth. Since \u03ba\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(q\u2217) = \u03b3 \u2191 and \u03ba\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(q \u2217) = 1 \u03b3\u2193 , the claim that X\u0302 = Xx,y,\u03c6,\u03a6\u0302,C\u0302 will follow if we can show that\ndX\u0302t = ( rX\u0302t \u2212 C\u0302t ) dt\u2212 Yt\u03ba\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(Q\u0302t) d\u03a6\u0302t, (A.17)\nso that X\u0302 is the wealth process associated with consumption C\u0302 and trading strategy \u03a6\u0302. We look for an expression for dX\u0302t of the form dX\u0302t = at dBt+bt dt+ct dGt where at = aX(X\u0302t, Yt, Q\u0302t, \u03a6\u0302t) and similarly for bt and ct. In the sequel, we only consider the case 0 < q\u2217(\u03be) < q\u2217( \u03be) < 1 so that Q\u0302 \u2208 (0, 1). The other cases in Proposition 5.3 can be treated in a similar way, replacing log(1 \u2212 Q\u0302) by log(Q\u0302 \u2212 1) if Q\u0302 > 1 and replacing log Q\u0302 and log \u03a6\u0302 by log(\u2212Q\u0302) and log(\u2212\u03a6\u0302), respectively, if Q\u0302 < 0. Special care is needed if 1 \u2208 [q\u2217(\u03be) < q\u2217(\u03be)]. In that case, by the final part of (a), one has to argue separately on J0, \u03c4J and K\u03c4,\u221eJ.

First, it follows from the definition of C\u0302 in Theorem 5.13(c), (A.8) and (A.11) that\ngEZ(t, C\u0302t, V\u0302 \u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(t, X\u0302t, Yt, \u03a6\u0302t)) = \u03b8n\u03be(Q\u0302t)V\u0302 \u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(t, X\u0302t, Yt, \u03a6\u0302t), t \u2265 0. (A.19)\nSecond, It\u00f4\u2019s formula, Proposition A.5(a) and (b) and the properties of \u03a6\u0302, C\u0302 from Theorem 5.13 give\ndM\u0302t = \u03c3(1 \u2212R)V\u0302 \u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(t, X\u0302t, Yt, \u03a6\u0302t)Q\u0302t dBt, (A.20)\nThird, combining (A.20) with (A.19) yields\ndV\u0302 \u03b3 \u2191,\u03b3\u2193(t, X\u0302t, Yt, \u03a6\u0302t) = dM\u0302t \u2212 gEZ(t, C\u0302t, V\u0302 \u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(t, X\u0302t, Yt, \u03a6\u0302t)) dt\n= V\u0302 \u03b3 \u2191,\u03b3\u2193(t, X\u0302t, Yt, \u03a6\u0302t)\n( \u03c3(1\u2212R)Q\u0302t dBt \u2212 \u03b8n\u03be(Q\u0302t) dt ) .\nThe formula for the stochastic exponential now gives (A.18). Next, fix \u03b2 > 0 and let C > 0 be a uniform bound for Q\u0302 and \u03bd > 0 a lower bound for n\u03be. Since Q\u0302 is uniformly bounded, Novikov\u2019s condition implies that E(\u03b2\u03c3(1 \u2212 R)Q\u0302 \u2022 B) is a true martingale. Hence, (A.18) yields\nE\n[\n|V\u0302 \u03b3 \u2191,\u03b3\u2193(t, X\u0302t, Yt, \u03a6\u0302t)|\n\u03b2 ]\n= |V\u0302 \u03b3 \u2191,\u03b3\u2193(0, X\u03020, Y0, \u03a6\u03020)| \u03b2 E\n[\ne\u03b2(\u03b2\u22121) \u03c32(1\u2212R)2 2 \u222b t 0 Q\u0302 2 s ds\u2212\u03b8 \u222b T 0 n\u03be(Q\u0302s) ds\n]\n\u2264 |V\u0302 \u03b3 \u2191,\u03b3\u2193(0, X\u03020, Y0, \u03a6\u03020)| \u03b2e\u03b2(\u03b2\u22121) \u03c32(1\u2212R)2 2 C2\u2212\u03b8\u03bd)t, (A.21)\nwhere C is a (upper or lower as required) bound on Q\u0302, and \u03bd is a lower bound on n\u03be. For \u03b2 = 2, (A.21) shows that M\u0302 is a square-integrable martingale. For \u03b2 = 1, (A.21) shows that limt\u2192\u221e E [ |V\u0302 \u03b3 \u2191,\u03b3\u2193(t, X\u0302t, Yt, \u03a6\u0302t)| ] =\n0 and together with (A.19) and the fact that n\u03be is uniformly bounded, this implies that M\u0302t converges in L1 to M\u0302\u221e := \u222b t 0 gEZ(s, C\u0302s, V\u0302 \u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(s, X\u0302s, Ys, \u03a6\u0302s)) ds. Hence, M\u0302 is a uniformly integrable martingale.\nDefinition A.8. Suppose that X = (Xt)t\u22650 and Y = (Yt)t\u22650 are nonnegative progressive processes. We say that X has the same order as Y (and write X O = Y , noting that O = is an equivalence relation) if there exist constants k,K \u2208 (0,\u221e) such that\n0 \u2264 kY \u2264 X \u2264 KY.\nDenote the set of progressive processes with the same order as X by O(X) \u2286 P+.\nDefinition A.9.

Then the set SO of self-order consumption streams is given by\nSO :=\n{\nX \u2208 P++ : E\n[\u222b \u221e\n0 Xt dt\n]\n< \u221e and X O = JX\n}\n.\nMoreover, set\nSO\u03bd := { X \u2208 SO : ( e\u03bdtXt )\nt\u22650 \u2208 SO\n}\nfor \u03bd \u2265 0, and SO+ = \u222a\u03bd>0SO\u03bd .\nLemma A.10.

Then the process (e \u2212\u03b4\u03b8tC\u03021\u2212Rt )t\u22650 lies in SO+.\nFurther, C\u0302 is uniquely proper.\nProof. First, note that\ne\u2212\u03b4\u03b8tC\u03021\u2212Rt = e \u2212\u03b4\u03b8t(X\u0302t + \u03a6\u0302tY\u0303t) 1\u2212Rn\u03be(Q\u0302t) 1\u2212R = (1\u2212R)V\u0302 \u03b3 \u2191,\u03b3\u2193(t, X\u0302t, Yt, \u03a6\u0302t)n\u03be(Q\u0302t) \u03b8\nSince n\u03be is uniformly bounded from above and from below, by Lemma A.10 it remains to show that that ((1 \u2212R)V\u0302 (t, X\u0302t, Yt, \u03a6\u0302t))t\u22650 \u2208 SO+. To this end, it suffices to show that ((1 \u2212 R)V\u0302 (t, X\u0302t, Yt, \u03a6\u0302t))t\u22650 \u2208 SO\u03bd for some \u03bd > 0. Since n is uniformly bounded from above and below by a positive constants, there is D > \u03bd > 0 such that D \u2265 \u03b8n+ \u03bd \u2265 \u03bd > 0. Now using that E(\u03c3(1 \u2212R)Q\u0302 \u2022B)t is a martingale by Novikov\u2019s condition and the fact that Q\u0302 is uniformly bounded, we obtain\nJ exp(\u03bd\u00b7)V\u0302 t = E\n[\u222b \u221e\nt exp(\u03bds)(1\u2212R)V\u0302 (s, X\u0302s, Ys, \u03a6\u0302s) ds\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 Ft ]\n= (1\u2212R)V\u0302 (t, X\u0302t, Yt, \u03a6\u0302t)E\n[ \u222b \u221e\nt exp\n(\n\u2212\n\u222b s\nt \u03b8n(Q\u0302u)\u2212 \u03bd du\n)\nds\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 Ft ]\n(A.22)\nThe claim that (e\u2212\u03b4\u03b8tC\u03021\u2212Rt )t\u22650 lies in SO+ now follows from the fact that the last factor on the right hand side of (A.22) lies in [ 1D , 1 \u03bd ].\nThe fact that there is a unique utility process V C\u0302 associated to C\u0302 now follows from Herdegen et al [13, Theorem 4.7].\nProof of Theorem 5.15. First, it follows from Proposition A.11 and Theorem 5.13 that C\u0302 is uniquely proper and has continuous paths.\nNext, define the process M\u0302 = (M\u0302t)t\u22650 by\nM\u0302t :=\n\u222b t\n0 gEZ(s, C\u0302s, V\u0302\n\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(s, X\u0302s, Ys, \u03a6\u0302s)) ds+ V\u0302 \u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(t, X\u0302t, Yt, \u03a6\u0302t).\nBy Proposition A.7, M\u0302 is a uniformly integrable martingale with\nM\u0302\u221e =\n\u222b \u221e\n0 e\u2212\u03b4s\n(C\u0302s) 1\u2212S\n1\u2212 S ((1 \u2212R)V\u0302 \u03b3 \u2191,\u03b3\u2193(s, X\u0302s, Ys, \u03a6\u0302s)) \u03c1 ds.\nThis implies that\nV\u0302 \u03b3 \u2191,\u03b3\u2193(t, X\u0302t, Yt, \u03a6\u0302t) = M\u0302t \u2212\n\u222b t\n0 gEZ(s, C\u0302s, V\u0302\n\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(s, X\u0302s, Ys, \u03a6\u0302s)) ds\n= E [\nM\u0302\u221e\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 Ft ] \u2212\n\u222b t\n0 gEZ(s, C\u0302s, V\u0302\n\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(s, X\u0302s, Ys, \u03a6\u0302s)) ds\n= E\n[\u222b \u221e\nt gEZ(s, C\u0302s, V\u0302\n\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(s, X\u0302s, Ys, \u03a6\u0302s))\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 Ft ] .\nThus (V\u0302 \u03b3 \u2191,\u03b3\u2193(t, X\u0302t, Yt, \u03a6\u0302t)t)t\u22650 is a utility process for C\u0302. Note that it is never vanishes and hence is a proper solution. Thus, it coincides with V C\u0302 by uniqueness of utility processes (for proper solutions).\nA.4 Verification argument\nProof of Proposition 5.17. First, note that the dynamics of X + \u03b5X\u0302 are given by\nd(Xt + \u03b5X\u0302t) = r(Xt + \u03b5X\u0302t) dt\u2212 (Ct + \u03b5C\u0302t) dt\u2212 Yt\u03b3 \u2191 d(\u03a6\u2191t + \u03b5\u03a6\u0302 \u2191 t ) + Yt \u03b3\u2193 d(\u03a6\u2193t + \u03b5\u03a6\u0302 \u2193 t ).\nNext, fix arbitrary bounded stopping times \u03c41 \u2264 \u03c42.

Consequently, since gEZ is increasing in its last two arguments, and C + \u03b5C\u0302 and V C+\u03b5C\u0302 are increasing in \u03b5, gEZ(\u00b7, C + \u03b5C\u0302, V C+\u03b5C\u0302) is increasing in \u03b5. Applying the Monotone Convergence Theorem for conditional expectations yields\nV \u2217t = lim \u03b5\u21920 V C+\u03b5C\u0302t = lim \u03b5\u21920 E\n[\u222b \u221e\nt gEZ(s, Cs + \u03b5C\u0302s, V\nC+\u03b5C\u0302 s ) ds\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 Ft ] = E [\u222b \u221e\nt gEZ(s, Cs, V\n\u2217 s ) ds\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 Ft ] .\nTherefore, V \u2217 is a solution associated to C. Moreover, for each t \u2265 0, V \u2217t < 0 P-a.s. by the fact that V C+\u03b5C\u0302t < 0 P-a.s. for each \u03b5 and V C+\u03b5C\u0302 is increasing in \u03b5. Thus, V \u2217 is proper. It therefore agrees with the unique proper solution V C and via (A.27) we obtain (A.26).\nNext, assume R < 1. For \u03bd > 0 and let C\u03bdt := Ct \u2227 \u03bd \u22121e\u2212tC\u0302t. Then V\u0302 \u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(I,X + \u03b5X\u0302, Y,\u03a6 + \u03b5\u03a6\u0302) is a supersolution for C + \u03b5C\u0302 by Proposition 5.17, and a fortiori a supersolution for C\u03bd.\nMoreover, there exists an extremal solution V C \u03bd associated to C\u03bd which is decreasing in \u03bd by [13, Proposition E.3]. Furthermore, since C is right-continuous, C\u03bd is right-continuous. The extremal solution V C \u03bd associated to C\u03b5 is therefore proper by [13, Theorem 4.5 and Remark 5.7].\nFurthermore, using that (C\u03bdt ) 1\u2212R \u2264 \u03bdR\u22121e(R\u22121)tC\u0302t\n1\u2212R , we obtain\n(1\u2212R)V \u03b3 \u2191,\u03b3\u2193(t,Xt + \u03b5X\u0302t, Y,\u03a6t + \u03b5\u03a6\u0302t) \u2265 e \u2212\u03b4\u03b8t(\u03bdC\u0302t) 1\u2212Rn\u03be(Q\u0302t) \u2212\u03b8\n\u2265 \u03bd2(1\u2212R)n\u03be(Qt) \u2212\u03b8e(1\u2212R\u2212\u03b4\u03b8)t(C\u03bdt ) 1\u2212R \u2265 \u03bd2(1\u2212R)D\u2212\u03b8e(1\u2212R\u2212\u03b4\u03b8)t(C\u03bdt ) 1\u2212R,\nwhere D := m(q\u2217(\u03be)) is an upper bound for n\u03be. Now using that V C \u03bd is uniformly integrable by [13, Remark 2.2], the comparison result [13, Corollary B.6], gives V\u0302 \u03b3 \u2191,\u03b3\u2193(I,X + \u03b5X\u0302, Y,\u03a6 + \u03b5\u03a6\u0302) \u2265 V C \u03bd . In particular, V \u03b3\n\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(0,X0 + \u03b5X\u03020, y,\u03a60 + \u03b5\u03a6\u03020) \u2265 V C\u03bd 0 ,\nand letting \u03b5, \u03bd \u2193 0 and using Proposition A.6(b), we obtain\nlim \u03b5\u21920\nV C \u03bd 0 \u2264 V \u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(0, x, y, \u03c6). (A.28)\nFinally, set V \u2217 = lim\u03bd\u21920 V C\u03bd . Using that c\n1\u2212S\n1\u2212S ((1\u2212R)v) \u03c1 is increasing both in c and v (recall \u03c1 > 0),\nmonotone convergence gives, for t \u2265 0\nV \u2217t = limn\u2192\u221e E\n[ \u222b \u221e\nt e\u2212\u03b4s\n(C\u03bds ) 1\u2212S\n1\u2212 S ((1 \u2212R)V C\n\u03bd\ns ) \u03c1 ds\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 Ft ] = E [ \u222b \u221e\nt e\u2212\u03b4s C1\u2212Ss 1\u2212 S ((1\u2212R)V \u2217s ) \u03c1 ds\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 Ft ] .\nHence, V \u2217 is a solution for C. It is a proper solution since for each t \u2265 0, V \u2217t > 0 if V C\u03bd t > 0 for some \u03bd and V C \u03bd\nt > 0 on {J (C\u03bd )1\u2212R > 0} = {JC 1\u2212R > 0} up to null sets by the fact that each V C \u03bd is proper and\nC\u0302 is strictly positive. Therefore, V \u2217 must agree with the unique proper solution V C associated to C, and via (A.28) we obtain (A.26).\nA.5 The ill posed case\nProof of Proposition 5.19. Define \u03be as in (5.1). (a) We only provide an argument for the case S \u2264 R < 1; the argument for the case R < S < 1 is very similar and hence omitted. We distinguish three cases.\nCase 1: m(0) \u2264 0. Without loss of generality we may assume that x > 0 and \u03c6 = 0, since otherwise one can liquidate the entire risky position at t = 0 and end up with a strictly positive pure-cash position, which lies in the interior of the solvency region. Consider a sequence of investment-consumption strategies (\u03a6n, Cn)n\u2208N, where \u03a6 n \u2261 0 and Cn = \u03b7nZ n where (\u03b7n)n\u2208N is a decreasing sequence of positive real numbers converging to \u2212 S1\u2212Sm(0) \u2265 0 and Z n := Zx,\u03a6\nn,Cn ; see (3.1). It is easy to verify that Cn \u2208 C\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(x, \u03c6, y) for each n. Then by the calculations in Section 3.1, the (unique) utility process V C n = (V C n\nt )t\u22650 associated with C n satisfies\nV C n\n0 =\n(\n\u03b71\u2212Sn H(0, \u03b7n)\n)\u03b8 x1\u2212R\n1\u2212R =\n(\n\u03b71\u2212Sn S(m(0) + 1\u2212SS \u03b7n)\n)\u03b8 x1\u2212R\n1\u2212R ,\nwhere H(\u00b7, \u00b7) is defined in (3.5). Now letting n \u2192 \u221e, the claim follows.\nCase 2: m(0) > 0 and m(1) \u2264 0. Without loss of generality we may assume that x = 0 and \u03c6 > 0, since otherwise at t = 0 one can invest all the current wealth into the risky asset and end up with a pure-stock position, which lies in the interior of the solvency region. Consider a sequence of investmentconsumption strategies (\u03a6n, Cn)n\u2208N, where \u03a6 n = Z n Y and C n = \u03b7n \u03b3\u2193 Zn where (\u03b7n)n\u2208N is a decreasing sequence of positive real numbers converging to \u2212 S1\u2212Sm(1) \u2265 0 and Z n := Zx,\u03a6\nn,Cn ; see (3.1). It is easy to verify that Cn \u2208 C\u03b3\u2193,\u03b3\u2193(x, \u03c6, y) for each n. Then by similar calculations as in Section 3.1, the (unique) utility process V C n = (V C n\nt )t\u22650 associated with C n satisfies\nV C n\n0 =\n(\n\u03b71\u2212Sn H(1, \u03b7n)\n)\u03b8 (\nx \u03b3\u2193\n)1\u2212R\n1\u2212R =\n(\n\u03b71\u2212Sn S(m(1) + 1\u2212SS \u03b7n)\n)\u03b8 (\nx \u03b3\u2193\n)1\u2212R\n1\u2212R ,\nwhere H(\u00b7, \u00b7) is defined in (3.5). Now letting n \u2192 \u221e, the claim follows.\nCase 3: m(0) > 0, m(1) > 0, m(qM) < 0 and \u03be \u2264 \u03be\u0304. Consider a decreasing sequence (\u03ben)n\u2208N with \u03ben \u2193 \u03be\u0304. For each n \u2208 N, set \u03b3 \u2191 n := \u03ben/\u03b3 \u2193 and denote by (\u03a6n, Cn) the optimal strategy from Theorem 5.13 corresponding to the (well-posed) problem with transaction cost \u03b3\u2191n on purchases and \u03b3\u2193 on sales. Note that each Cn is (\u03b3\u2191, \u03b3\u2193)-attainable as C\n\u03b3\u2191n,\u03b3\u2193 (x, \u03c6, y) \u2286 C\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(x, \u03c6, y). Since x := x+ \u03c6 +y 1 \u03b3\u2193 \u2212 \u03c6\u2212y\u03b3\u2191 > 0\nwe have that for large enough n, x+ \u03c6+y 1 \u03b3\u2193 \u2212 \u03c6\u2212y\u03b3\u2191n > x 2 > 0 and then using Theorem 5.15 together with\nthe lower bound x+ \u03c6y\u03ba \u03b3\u2191n,\u03b3\u2193\n(\nq \u03b3\u2191n,\u03b3\u2193\n(\n\u03c6y x+\u03c6y\n))\n\u2265 x+ \u03c6+y 1 \u03b3\u2193 \u2212 \u03c6\u2212y\u03b3\u2191n \u2265 x 2 gives\nV C n\n0 =\n(\nx+ \u03c6y\u03ba \u03b3\u2191n,\u03b3\u2193\n(\nq \u03b3\u2191n,\u03b3\u2193\n(\n\u03c6y x+\u03c6y\n)))1\u2212R\n1\u2212R n\u03ben\n(\nq \u03b3\u2191n,\u03b3\u2193\n(\n\u03c6y\nx+ \u03c6y\n))\u2212\u03b8S\n\u2265 x1\u2212R\n(1\u2212R)21\u2212R (\u2016n\u03ben\u2016\u221e)\n\u2212\u03b8S\nUsing that limn\u2192\u221e \u2016n\u03ben\u2016\u221e = 0 by Corollary A.3, the result follows. (b) We only provide an argument for the case S \u2265 R < 1; the argument for the case R > S > 1 is very similar and hence omitted. We distinguish two cases. Case 1: m(qM) \u2264 0. Since C\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(x, \u03c6, y) \u2286 C0(x + \u03c6, y), the claim follows from the fact that for each C \u2208 C0(x+ \u03c6, y), we have V C 0 = \u2212\u221e by [12, Corollary 8.2].\nCase 2: m(qM) > 0 and \u03be \u2265 \u03be\u0304. Note that the finiteness of transaction costs implies \u03be\u0304 < \u221e while m(qM ) > 0 implies \u03be\u0304 > 1. Let (\u03ben)n\u2208N be an increasing sequence with \u03ben \u2191 \u03be\u0304. For each n \u2208 N set \u03b3\u2191n = \u03ben/\u03b3 \u2193. By Theorem 5.18, the problem with transaction costs (\u03b3\u2191n, \u03b3\u2193) is well-posed for every n \u2208 N with value function given by (5.13). Fix C \u2208 C\u03b3\u2191,\u03b3\u2193(x, \u03c6, y).

The case qM = 1 is broadly similar, but the leading terms are of different order. See Hobson et al [15] for a derivation of the expansion for the case qM = 1 in the additive setting.\nBy Definition 5.1, the assumptions that the problem (4.3) is well-posed for arbitrarily small transaction cost implies that m\u0302 = m(qM) \u2265 0 if R < 1 and m(qM) > 0 if R > 1.\nRecall n+(z) solves n \u2032 = O(q, n) subject to n+(z)(z) = m(z). (Here z \u2208 (0, qM ) \u2229 {q : m(q) > 0}.) Then\n\u03b6+ = \u03b6+(z) > qM is such that n + (z)(\u03b6 +) = m(\u03b6+) and moreover (1\u2212 R)n+(z) > (1 \u2212 R)m on (z, \u03b6 +) \\ {1}.\nFurther, \u03a3+(z) = exp\n(\n\u222b \u03b6+(z) z 1 q(1\u2212q)\nn+ (z) (q)\u2212m(q) \u2113(q)\u2212n+ (z) (q) dq\n)\n.\nFor u \u2208 (0, qM )\u2229{q : m(q) > 0} introduce Nu : [\u2212u,\u221e) \u2192 R + defined by Nu(v) = n + (qM\u2212u) (qM + v)\u2212 mM . Introduce also M and L given by M(v) = m(qM + v)\u2212mM and L(v) = \u2113(qM + v)\u2212mM . Note that M(v) = R(1\u2212S)2S \u03c3 2v2 = RDv2 where D = (1\u2212S)2S \u03c3\n2. Define Gu : [\u22121,\u221e) by Gu(v) = 1 D (Nu(uv) \u2212M(uv)). (The normalisation 1 D is largely cosmetic but will help highlight the point at which the elasticity of intertemporal consumption S enters the expansion.) Then Gu(\u22121) = 0.

Similarly, using that g0 \u2261 0 we find\ng\u20321(v) = 0 g1(\u22121) = 0\nso that again g1 \u2261 0.

It follows that for z close to qM , n + (z)(q) = m(z) and then \u03b6 +(z) = 2qM \u2212 z, and to leading order (in the shadow fraction of wealth co-ordinates) the no-transaction region is symmetric about the Merton ratio.

If we view O\u0304(q, n\u0304) = O\u0304(q, n\u0304;S) as a function of S, then clearly O\u0304 is strictly increasing (resp. decreasing) in S over (q, n\u0304) on which 11\u2212q n\u0304\u2212m\u0304(q) \u2113\u0304(q)\u2212n\u0304 (n\u0304+ \u03b4) is positive (resp. negative). Hence given (8.1), we must have sgn(qM )O\u0304(q, n(q); S\u0302) > sgn(qM )O\u0304(q, n(q); S\u0303) over q \u2208 (q\u2217, q \u2217) \\ {1} for S\u0302 > S\u0303.\nRecall the definitions of (n+(z)(q))q\u2208[z,\u03b6+(q)], \u03b6 +(z) and \u03a3+(z) as well as the relevant domain of z defined in Proposition A.1 or A.2. Define (a+(z)(q))q\u2208[z,\u03b6+(z)] via a + (z)(q) := S 1\u2212S (n + (z)(q) \u2212 \u03b4 S ). By construction,\nd\ndq a+(z)(q) = O\u0304(q, a + (z)(q);S), q \u2208 [z, \u03b6 +(z)],\na+(z)(z) = m\u0304(z), a + (z)(\u03b6 +(z)) = m\u0304(\u03b6+(z)), and\n\u03a3+(z) = exp\n(\n\u222b \u03b6+(z)\nz\n1\nq(1\u2212 q)\na+(z)(q)\u2212 m\u0304(q)\n\u2113\u0304(q)\u2212 a+(z)(q) dq\n)\n.\nLet n\u0302+(z) and n\u0303 + (z) be the two versions of n + (z) under S = S\u0302 and S = S\u0303 < S\u0302 respectively while all other model parameters are fixed. We will apply the same overhead notations to \u03b6+(z), a+(z) and \u03a3 + which are defined relative to the underlying parameters S\u0302 and S\u0303. Since m\u0304(\u00b7) does not depend on S, a\u0302+(z)(z) = m\u0304(z) = a\u0303 + (z)(z). Also (a\u0302 + (z)) \u2032(z) = 0 = (a\u0303+(z)) \u2032(z) for z 6= 1. Suppose that qM \u2208 (0, 1). We first show that a\u0302 + (z)(q) > a\u0303 + (z)(q) near q = z for any z \u2208 (0, qM ). Using the ODE satisfied by a+(z) and L\u2019Hospital rule, we obtain\nlim q\u2193z\na+(z)(q)\u2212 m\u0304(z)\n(q \u2212 z)2 =\nm\u0304\u2032(z)\n\u03c32z(1\u2212 z)2\n[\n1 S (m\u0304(z) + \u03b4) \u2212 m\u0304(z)\n]\n,\nwhere the leading factor is negative and in turn the whole expression is strictly increasing in S as m\u0304(z)+\u03b4 = S(m(z)\u2212\u03b4)1\u2212S > S(mM\u2212\u03b4) 1\u2212S = \u03b4\u2212r\u2212 \u03bb2 2R \u2265 0 for all z 6= qM under condition (8.1). Hence a\u0302 + (z)(q) must be initially strictly larger than a\u0303+(z)(q). Together with the facts that O\u0304(q, a; S\u0302) > O\u0304(q, a; S\u0303) along any solution trajectory (excluding the end points), we conclude \u03b6\u0302+(z) \u2265 \u03b6\u0303+(z) and a\u0302+(z)(q) \u2265 a\u0303 + (z)(q) at least up to q = \u03b6\u0303+(z)<1. Then\n\u03a3\u0302+(z) = exp\n(\n\u222b \u03b6\u0302+(z)\nz\n1\nq(1\u2212 q)\na\u0302+(z)(q)\u2212 m\u0304(q)\n\u2113\u0304(q)\u2212 a\u0302+(z)(q) dq\n)\n\u2265 exp\n(\n\u222b \u03b6\u0303+(z)\nz\n1\nq(1\u2212 q)\na\u0302+(z)(q)\u2212 m\u0304(q)\n\u2113\u0304(q)\u2212 a\u0302+(z)(q) dq\n)\n\u2265 exp\n(\n\u222b \u03b6\u0303+(z)\nz\n1\nq(1\u2212 q)\na\u0303+(z)(q)\u2212 m\u0304(q)\n\u2113\u0304(q)\u2212 a\u0303+(z)(q) dq\n)\n= \u03a3\u0303+(z),\nand in turn q\u0302\u2217 = (\u03a3\u0302 +)\u22121(\u03be) \u2265 (\u03a3\u0303+)\u22121(\u03be) = q\u0303\u2217 since \u03a3 +(\u00b7) is decreasing.\nThe arguments are similar in the case of qM > 1 except some extra care is needed around q = 1. For any z \u2208 (0, 1), a+(z)(1) = m\u0304(1) and (a + (z)) \u2032(1) = m\u0304\u2032(1) such that the ordering of a\u0302+(z)(q) and a\u0303 + (z)(q) is not immediately clear on q > 1. But again we can deduce via L\u2019Hospital rule that\nlim q\u21921\na+(z)(q)\u2212 m\u0304(q)\n(1\u2212 q)2 = \u2212\n\u03c32\n2 m\u0304\u2032(1) 1 S (m\u0304(1) + \u03b4) \u2212 m\u0304(1) ,\nwhich is positive and strictly increasing in S under condition (8.1). Hence we conclude a\u0302+(z)(q) > a\u0303+(z)(q) in the neighbourhood of q = 1. The results for q\u2217 can be established similarly by parameterising the solutions to the family of ODEs via their right boundary points. Results for the case of qM < 0 can be derived using similar ideas.\n(b) If instead the parameters are such that (8.2) holds, then the argument in part (a) does not work as n\u0304(q) + \u03b4 may change sign and hence the monotonicity of O\u0304(q, n\u0304;S) in S is ambiguous. But suppose qM > 0 and the problems under S \u2208 {S\u0302, S\u0303} are well-posed for all sufficiently small transaction costs. Then there exists \u03b4 > 0 such that for all z \u2208 (qM \u2212 \u03b4, qM ), n + (z) (q) is well-defined and is strictly\npositive over q \u2208 [z, \u03b6+(z)]. Moreover, since the family of solutions (n+(z)(\u00b7))z is monotonic in z with n+(z)(q) \u2192 mM as z \u2192 qM , one can choose \u2206 such that |n + (z)(q) \u2212mM | < \u03c9 and |m(q) \u2212mM | < \u03c9 on q \u2208 [z, \u03b6+(z)] for all z \u2208 (qM \u2212\u2206, qM ) where \u03c9 > 0 is arbitrary. Then\na+(z)(q) + \u03b4 = S(n+(z)(q)\u2212 \u03b4)\n1\u2212 S \u2264\nS(mM + sgn(1\u2212 S)\u03c9 \u2212 \u03b4)\n1\u2212 S\n= \u03b4 \u2212 r \u2212 \u03bb2\n2R +\nS\n|1\u2212 S| \u03c9 < 0\nand similarly m\u0304(q) + \u03b4 < 0 if \u03c9 is chosen to be sufficiently small. In such case, O\u0304(q, a+(z)(q); S\u0302) < O\u0304(q, a+(z)(q); S\u0303) along the solution trajectory (a + (z)(q))z<q<\u03b6+(z), and that a\u0302 + (z)(q) < a\u0303 + (z)(q) near q = z (and near q = 1 as well if qM > 1). Following similar arguments in part (a), we can conclude \u03b6\u0302+(z) \u2264 \u03b6\u0303+(z) and a\u0302+(z)(q) \u2264 a\u0303 + (z)(q) up to q = \u03b6\u0302 +(z), and in turn \u03a3\u0302+(z) \u2264 \u03a3\u0303+(z) for z \u2208 (qM\u2212\u03b4, qM ). Thus there exists \u03b5 := \u03a3\u0302+(qM \u2212 \u2206) \u2212 1 > 0 such that q\u0302\u2217 = (\u03a3\u0302 +)\u22121(\u03be) \u2264 (\u03a3\u0303+)\u22121(\u03be) = q\u0303\u2217 for all \u03be \u2264 1 + \u03b5.\nThe proof for q\u2217 is similar upon parameterising the solutions to the family of ODEs via the right boundary points. The analysis can be analogously extended to qM < 0.\nC.2 Comparative statics in R\nNow we turn to comparative statics in R. For the case R,S > 1 it is useful to introduce an auxiliary function. For q \u2208 (0,\u221e) \\ {1, 2S/(S +1)}, define c = c(q) as the solution to the equation O(q, c)/c = 2/q. Straightforward algebra leads to\nc(q) = \u2113(q) + (S \u2212 1)q\n2S \u2212 (S + 1)q (m(q)\u2212 \u2113(q)) = m(q)\u2212\n2S(1 \u2212 q)\n2S \u2212 (S + 1) (m(q)\u2212 \u2113(q)). (C.1)\nThe definition of c is extended to q = 0 and q = 1 via c(0) := limq\u21930 c(q) = \u2113(0) = m(0) and c(1) := limq\u21921 c(q) = m(1) = \u2113(1). Note that c(q) is continuous on q \u2208 [0, 2S/(S + 1)) \u2283 (0, 1) and we have c\u2032(0) = \u2113\u2032(0) and c\u2032(1) = m\u2032(1). We also have\n\n  \n  \n\u2113(q) < c(q) < m(q), q \u2208 (0, 1); c(q) < m(q) < \u2113(q), q \u2208 (\n1, 2SS+1\n)\n;\nm(q) < \u2113(q) < c(q), q \u2208 (\n2S S+1 ,\u221e\n)\n.\nAlso, on (0, 1) \u00d7 (0,\u221e), O(q,z)z > 2 q for z \u2208 (\u2113(q), c(q)) and O(q,z) z < 2 q for z \u2208 (c(q),m(q)). Further, on (1, 2SS+1) \u00d7 (0,m(q)), O(q,z) z < 2 q on (0, c(q) +) and O(q,z)z > 2 q on (c(q)\n+,m(q)). Finally, on ( 2SS+1 ,\u221e), O(q,z)\nz < 2 q on (0,m(q)).\nLemma C.1. Suppose \u03bb > 0 and the problem is well-posed such that (n(\u00b7), q\u2217, q \u2217) is the solution to the free boundary problem in Proposition 5.3. Then any of the following is a sufficient condition for 2n(q)\u2212 qn\u2032(q) > 0 on q \u2208 [q\u2217, q \u2217].\n(a) S < 1.\n(b) S > 1, m(0) > 0, and either (recall the definition of c(q) in (C.1)):\n(i) 2c(q)\u2212 qc\u2032(q) > 0 on (0, 1) if qM < 1 or on (0, 2S S+1) if qM > 1,\n(ii) R \u2265 2."

Upon taking limit, we get\nlim q\u21921\nf(q)\n(q \u2212 1)2 =\nS(m\u2032(1)\u2212 \u2113\u2032(1))m\u2032(1)\n(S \u2212 1)m(1) \u2212\nc\u2032\u2032(1)\u2212m\u2032\u2032(1)\n2\n= S(m\u2032(1)\u2212 \u2113\u2032(1))m\u2032(1)\n(S \u2212 1)m(1) \u2212\n2S(m\u2032(1) \u2212 \u2113\u2032(1))\nS \u2212 1\n= S(\u2113\u2032(1) \u2212m\u2032(1))\nS \u2212 1\n[\n2\u2212 m\u2032(1)\nm(1)\n]\n> 0\nbecause \u2113\u2032(1) > m\u2032(1) and 2m(1) > m\u2032(1) under the assumption of m(0) > 0, qM > 1 and S > 1. Hence we conclude n(q) > c(q) near q = 1.\nUsing similar arguments in the case of qM \u2208 (0, 1), we must have \u2113(q) > m(q) > n(q) > c(q) on 1 < q < q\u2217 \u2227 2SS+1 . As \u039e(q, n) = O(q,n) n = S\u22121 S 1 1\u2212q n\u2212m(q) \u2113(q)\u2212n is continuously decreasing in n \u2208 (0, \u2113(q)) for any fixed q > 1, we have n \u2032(q) n(q) = O(q,n(q)) n(q) < O(q,c(q)) c(q) = 2 q for 1 < q < q \u2217 \u2227 2SS+1 . If q\u2217 > 2SS+1 , then c(q) > \u2113(q) > m(q) > n(q) > 0 on q \u2208 ( 2S S+1 , q\n\u2217). Note that \u039e(q, n) is discontinuous at n = \u2113(q). But since H(q, n) is still locally continuous and decreasing on n \u2208 [0, \u2113(q)) and n \u2208 (\u2113(q),\u221e) respectively under fixed q > 1, we have\n2 q = \u039e(q, c(q)) > lim n\u2192\u221e \u039e(q, n) = S \u2212 1 S 1 q \u2212 1 \u2265 S \u2212 1 S 1 q \u2212 1 m(q) \u2113(q) = \u039e(q, 0) > \u039e(q, n(q)) =\nn\u2032(q)\nn(q)\non 2SS+1 < q < q \u2217. By continuity of n(q) and n\u2032(q), the above inequality holds at q = 2SS+1 and q = 1 as well. Finally, the case of 1 \u2264 q\u2217 < qM < q \u2217 under small transaction costs can be handled similarly using the fact that the solution n(q) in such case is bounded below by n+ (1) (q). (ii) If m(0) > 0 and \u2113\u2032(0) \u2265 0 then we are in Case b(i), so we only need to consider m(0) > 0 and \u2113\u2032(0) < 0. Since \u2113 is concave we have m(1) = \u2113(1) < \u2113(0) = m(0) so necessarily qM \u2208 (0, 1) and [q\u2217, q \u2217] \u2282 (0, 1). In what follows we only consider functions over (0, 1).\nDefine A(q) := qm(q) + (1 \u2212 q)\u2113(q). A is chosen so that A(z) = c(z) and A\u2032(z) = c\u2032(z) for z \u2208 {0, 1}, and to be a simple function. It is easily seen that A(q) > c(q). So, if we can show that n is always above A it will follow that 2n(q)\u2212 qn\u2032(q) > 0 on (q\u2217, q \u2217) as required. Note that O(q,A(q)) = (S\u22121)S A(q) q so that if n = A then n \u2032 > A\u2032 is equivalent to (S\u22121)S A(q) q > A\n\u2032. So, a sufficient condition for n > A on (0, 1) is (here we use m(q) \u2212 \u2113(q) = Dq(1 \u2212 q) where D = (S\u22121)S \u03c32 2 )\n(S \u2212 1)\nS\nA(q)\nq > \u2113\u2032(q) + (m(q)\u2212 \u2113(q)) + q(m\u2032(q)\u2212 \u2113\u2032(q))\n\u21d4 (S \u2212 1)(\u2113(q) + q(m(q)\u2212 \u2113(q))) > Sq\u2113\u2032(q) + Sq(m(q)\u2212 \u2113(q)) + Sq2(m\u2032(q)\u2212 \u2113\u2032(q)) \u21d4 (S \u2212 1)\u2113(q) > Sq\u2113\u2032(q) + q(m(q)\u2212 \u2113(q)) + Sq2(m\u2032(q)\u2212 \u2113\u2032(q)) \u21d4 (S \u2212 1)\u2113(0) + (S \u2212 1)q\u2113\u2032(0) + (S \u2212 1) q2\n2 \u2113\u2032\u2032(0) > Sq(\u2113\u2032(0) + q\u2113\u2032\u2032(0)) +Dq2(1\u2212 q) + SDq2(1\u2212 2q)\n\u21d4 (S \u2212 1)\u2113(0) > q\u2113\u2032(0) + q2\n2 \u2113\u2032\u2032(0)(2S \u2212 (S \u2212 1)) +Dq2((1\u2212 q) + S(1\u2212 2q))\n\u21d4 (S \u2212 1)\u2113(0) > q\u2113\u2032(0) + q2\n2 \u2113\u2032\u2032(0)(S + 1) +Dq2((S + 1)\u2212 q(1 + 2S)).\nThus we only need to establish (S \u2212 1)\u2113(0) > supq\u2208(0,1) \u03d5(q) where \u03d5(q) is a cubic function defined via\n\u03d5(q) := q\u2113\u2032(0) + \u03c32\n2S (S + 1)(S \u2212 1)(2\u2212R)q2 \u2212\n\u03c32 2S (S \u2212 1)(1 + 2S)q3,\nwhere we use that 12\u2113 \u2032\u2032(0) + D = \u03c3\n2\n2S (S \u2212 1)(2 \u2212 R). Note that \u03d5(0) = 0 < (S \u2212 1)\u2113(0) and \u03d5\u2032(0) = \u2113\u2032(0) < 0. Hence we are done if the coefficient of q2 is negative, which is equivalent to R \u2265 2.\nProof of Proposition 8.3. We will show that p\u0302\u2217 \u2264 p\u0303\u2217 and p\u0302 \u2217 \u2264 p\u0303\u2217 under the stated conditions in Lemma C.1. The last part of the proposition will then follow trivially. In what follows, we write\nm(q) = m(q;R) = \u03b4 \u2212 r(1\u2212 S)\nS \u2212\n1\u2212 S\nS \u03bb\u03c3q +R\n1\u2212 S\nS\n\u03c32\n2 q2 = m(q; 0) +R\n1\u2212 S\nS\n\u03c32\n2 q2,\n\u2113(q) = \u2113(q;R) = \u03b4 \u2212 r(1\u2212 S)\nS \u2212\n1\u2212 S\nS\n(\n\u03bb\u03c3 \u2212 \u03c32\n2\n)\nq \u2212 (1\u2212R) 1\u2212 S\nS\n\u03c32\n2 q2 = \u2113(q; 0) +R\n1\u2212 S\nS\n\u03c32\n2 q2,\nwhere m(q; 0) and \u2113(q; 0) do not depend on R. Note that \u2113(q)\u2212m(q) = \u2113(q; 0) \u2212m(q; 0).\nLet f(q) := n(q)\u2212m(q)\u2113(q)\u2212n(q) where n is a solution to n \u2032 = O(q, n). Then\nf \u2032(q) = (\u2113(q)\u2212 n(q))(n\u2032(q)\u2212m\u2032(q))\u2212 (n(q)\u2212m(q))(\u2113\u2032(q)\u2212 n\u2032(q))\n(\u2113(q)\u2212 n(q))2\n= 1 + f(q)\n\u2113(q)\u2212m(q)\n[\nS \u2212 1\nS(1\u2212 q) f(q)(m(q) + \u2113(q)f(q))\u2212m\u2032(q)\u2212 \u2113\u2032(q)f(q)\n]\n= 1 + f(q)\n\u2113(q; 0)\u2212m(q; 0)\n[\nS \u2212 1\nS(1\u2212 q) f(q)\n(\nm(q; 0) +R 1\u2212 S\nS\n\u03c32\n2 q2 +\n(\n\u2113(q; 0) +R 1\u2212 S\nS\n\u03c32 2 q2 ) f(q) )\n\u2212m\u2032(q; 0) \u2212R 1\u2212 S\nS \u03c32q \u2212\n(\n\u2113\u2032(q; 0) +R 1\u2212 S\nS \u03c32q\n)\nf(q)\n]\n= \u03a8(q, f(q); 0)\u2212 R(1 + f(q))2\nS(1\u2212 q)2 ((1\u2212 S)qf(q) + 2S(1\u2212 q)) =: \u03a8(q, f(q);R)\nfor some function \u03a8(q, f ;R) with \u03a8(q, f ; 0) being independent of R. In particular, \u03a8 depends on R linearly and we have\n\u2202\n\u2202R \u03a8(q, f ;R) = \u2212\n(1 + f)2\nS(1\u2212 q)2 ((1\u2212 S)qf + 2S(1\u2212 q)).\nAlong a solution trajectory of the free boundary value problem,\n(1\u2212 S)qf(q) + 2S(1\u2212 q) = (1\u2212 S)q n(q)\u2212m(q)\n\u2113(q)\u2212 n(q) + 2S(1\u2212 q)\n= \u2212Sq(1\u2212 q) O(q, n(q))\nn(q) + 2S(1 \u2212 q)\n= S(1\u2212 q)\nn(q)\n( 2n(q)\u2212 qn\u2032(q) ) .\nThen if any condition in Lemma C.1 holds such that 2n \u2212 qn\u2032 > 0, we have sgn ( \u2202 \u2202R\u03a8(q, f(q);R) )\n= sgn(q \u2212 1).\nRecall the definitions of (n+(z)(q))q\u2208[z,\u03b6+(q)], \u03b6 +(z) and \u03a3+(z) defined in Proposition A.1 or A.2. Set\nf+(z)(q) := n+ (z) (q)\u2212m(q)\n\u2113(q)\u2212n+ (z)\n(q) . Note that sgn(f+(z)(q)) = sgn(1\u2212 q). By construction,\nd\ndq f+(z)(q) = \u03a8(q, f + (z)(q);R), q \u2208 [z, \u03b6 +(z)],\nf+(z)(z) = 0 = f + (z)(\u03b6(z)) and\n\u03a3+(z) = exp\n(\n\u222b \u03b6+(z)\nz\nf+(z)(q)\nq(1\u2212 q) dq\n)\n.\nFix R\u0303 < R\u0302, and we will use the corresponding overhead notations to denote the particular quantities evaluated under R = R\u0303 and R = R\u0302 respectively similar to what we have done in the proof of Proposition 8.1.\nIf R\u0303 < R\u0302 are such that q\u0303M \u2265 1 \u2265 q\u0302M , then we obviously have q\u0302 \u2217 \u2264 1 \u2264 q\u0303\u2217. It is therefore sufficient to only consider values of R\u0303, R\u0302 such that q\u0303M , q\u0302M < 1 or q\u0303M , q\u0302M > 1. If q\u0303M , q\u0302M < 1, then the domain of a solution to the free boundary problem must be contained within (0, 1). Since \u03a8(q, f+(z)(q);R) is strictly decreasing in R on q \u2208 (0, 1) and f\u0302 + (z)(z) = 0 = f\u0303 + (z)(z) with\n(f+(z)) \u2032(z) = \u2212\nm\u2032(z; 0) +R 1\u2212SS \u03c3 2z\n1\u2212S S\n\u03c32 2 z(1\u2212 z) (C.2)\nwhich is decreasing in R such that (f\u0302+(z)) \u2032(z) < (f\u0303+(z)) \u2032(z) for z \u2208 (0, 1), we must have \u03b6\u0302(z) \u2264 \u03b6\u0303(z) < 1 and 0 \u2264 f\u0302(z)(q) \u2264 f\u0303 + (z)(q) for q \u2208 [z, \u03b6\u0302 +(z)]. Then\n\u03a3\u0303+(z) = exp\n(\n\u222b \u03b6\u0303+(z)\nz\nf\u0303+(z)(q)\nq(1\u2212 q) dq\n)\n\u2265 exp\n(\n\u222b \u03b6\u0302+(z)\nz\nf\u0303+(z)(q)\nq(1\u2212 q) dq\n)\n\u2265 exp\n(\n\u222b \u03b6\u0302+(z)\nz\nf\u0302+(z)(q)\nq(1\u2212 q) dq\n)\n= \u03a3\u0302+(z)\nand then q\u0302\u2217 = (\u03a3\u0302 +)\u22121(\u03be) \u2264 (\u03a3\u0303+)\u22121(\u03be) = q\u0303\u2217.\nSuppose q\u0303M , q\u0302M > 1. In case of z > 1 such that the domain of the solution lives on a subset of (1,\u221e), \u03a8(q, f+(z)(q);R) is now increasing in R and (f\u0302 + (z)) \u2032(z) > (f\u0303+(z)) \u2032(z) for z > 1 using (C.2). Hence \u03b6\u0303(z) \u2265 \u03b6\u0302(z) > qM and 0 \u2265 f\u0302 + (z)(q) \u2265 f\u0303 + (z)(q) for 1 < z \u2264 q \u2264 \u03b6\u0302 +(z). Then we can deduce \u03a3\u0303+(z) \u2265 \u03a3\u0302+(z) on z > 1. The same conclusion can be extended to z = 1 upon showing that (f\u0302+(1)) \u2032(1) > (f\u0303+(1))\n\u2032(1). It is sufficient to verify that\nlim q\u21921\nf(q) q \u2212 1 = S 1\u2212 S\nm\u2032(1) m(1) =\nR\u03c32 \u2212 \u03bb\u03c3\nR 1\u2212SS \u03c32 2 + \u03b4\u2212r(1\u2212S) S \u2212 1\u2212S S \u03bb\u03c3\nis increasing in R.

Finally, for q\u0303M , q\u0302M > 1 and z < 1 such that \u03b6\u0303 +(z) = \u03b6\u0303+(1) \u2265 \u03b6\u0302+(1) = \u03b6\u0302+(z), we have f\u0303+(z)(q) \u2265\nf\u0302+(z)(q) \u2265 0 on q \u2264 1, f\u0303 + (z)(1) = f\u0302 + (z)(1) = 0 and 0 \u2265 f\u0302 + (z)(q) = f\u0302 + (1)(q) \u2265 f\u0303 + (1)(q) = f\u0303 + (z)(q) on 1 \u2264 q \u2264 \u03b6\u0302(1).\nThen\n\u03a3\u0303+(z) = exp\n(\n\u222b \u03b6\u0303+(z)\nz\nf\u0303+(z)(q)\nq(1\u2212 q) dq\n)\n= exp\n(\n\u222b 1\nz\nf\u0303+(z)(q)\nq(1\u2212 q) dq +\n\u222b \u03b6\u0303+(1)\n1\nf\u0303+(z)(q)\nq(1\u2212 q) dq\n)\n\u2265 exp\n(\n\u222b 1\nz\nf\u0302+(z)(q)\nq(1\u2212 q) dq +\n\u222b \u03b6\u0302+(1)\n1\nf\u0302(z)(q)\nq(1\u2212 q) dq\n)\n= \u03a3\u0302+(z).\nHence \u03a3\u0303+(z) \u2265 \u03a3\u0302+(z) for all z which establishes q\u0302\u2217 \u2264 q\u0303\u2217. The result for the sale boundary can again be established by parametrising the solutions via their right boundary points."
