INTRODUCTION\nThere is currently an increasing demand for very large-scale integration (VLSI) photonic circuits1,2 that provide precise, rapid, and low-power control of visible optical fields. Quantum information applications from quantum computing and networks to sensing3\u20135 increasingly rely on atom6\u20138 and atom-like9\u201311 systems, which make use of optical transitions in the visible wavelength regime. In chemical sensing and imaging, visible light is required to interact with particular molecular species12 and to achieve higher resolution than possible with longer wavelengths. A leading approach for large-scale optical control is programmable Mach\u2013Zehnder meshes (MZMs),1 built from cascaded Mach\u2013Zehnder interferometers (MZIs) [Fig. 1(a)]. Each MZI performs the unitary operation U(2) as the fundamental building block for different types of meshes,13\u201316 such as multi-port interferometers [Fig. 1(b)] and binary trees [Fig. 1(c)]. The complexity of scaling\nthese circuits requires high-quality individual MZIs and has led to the development of many modulation schemes. In the near-infrared (NIR), phase modulation in MZIs has been demonstrated at largescale with thermo-optic phase shifters17\u201321 and in individual devices using free-carriers,22 \u03c7(2) nonlinearities,23\u201325 and MEMS.26 In the visible regime, previous reports on thermo-optic27\u201329 and thin-film lithium niobate30 MZIs show promise for VLSI photonics, but there remains an open challenge to build reliable MZMs that satisfy application requirements of high switching bandwidths (>10 MHz), high contrasts (>40 dB), and low losses (<1 dB) per modulator.\nTo address this need, we previously introduced a programmable MZM platform31 based on visible-spectrum silicon nitride (SiNx) waveguides with high-speed (>100 MHz) aluminum nitride (AlN) piezo-modulation.32 However, the modulators in this mesh have a high voltage-loss product (175 V dB), defined as VLP = V\u03c0 \u00d7 \u03b1m, where V\u03c0 is the voltage required for a \u03c0-phase shift and \u03b1m is the modulator insertion loss. The VLP metric governs the\nAPL Photon. 7, 051304 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0088424 7, 051304-1\n\u00a9 2022 The MITRE Corporation\n19 January 2024 00:29:25\nFIG. 1.

Conversely, for a set mesh size, cascading high-VLP modulators to reduce V\u03c0 or improve unitary fidelity33 may not be possible due to increasing photon losses. As the number of optical components in a mesh generally increases quadratically with the number of input/output fields,15 modulators with low VLPs are highly desirable.\nIn this work, we demonstrate a visible-spectrum phase and amplitude modulator using piezo-actuated mechanical cantilevers. An improved undercut process in the fabrication enables reliable, singly clamped cantilevers with large released regions (>500 \u03bcm) and lower VLPs in the 20\u201330 V dB range, an order of magnitude improvement over our previous work.31,34 The optically broadband modulator has a 6 V\u03c0 cm, up to >40 dB extinction, low hold-power consumption (<30 nW), \u22121.5 to \u22122 dB insertion loss, and minimal modulation losses. Moreover, the modulator exhibits a nearly flat frequency response from DC to a peak mechanical eigenmode (up to tens of MHz) for nanosecond switching or resonantly enhanced actuation to further reduce operating voltage (down to 0.15 V\u03c0 cm or 0.8 V dB). We arrange the phase modulators for differential operation13 in an MZI configuration [microscope image shown in Fig. 1(d)] with the four possible phase shifts labeled. The device consists of 400 nm wide \u00d7 300 nm thick SiNx waveguides coupled to an AlN piezo-stack [Fig. 1(e)]. The modulator operates by applying a voltage V s across the piezo-layer, which mechanically deforms the cantilever and induces a path length change \u0394L and phase shift \u03b8 in the waveguides. We characterize the device across the 700\u2013780 nm\nwavelength range and explore different cantilever designs to target various operating regimes."

            "text": "We illustrate the cantilever design in Fig. 2. A scanning electron microscope (SEM) image is shown in Fig. 2(a) of the fully fabricated and released cantilever with false-colored SiNx waveguides, which are looped several times across the surface of the cantilever to increase the phase shifter response. Figure 2(b) maps out a cross section of our entire layer stack.\nThe fabrication is based on a 200 mm-wafer optical lithography process at Sandia National Labs, which we briefly summarize. First, a bottom aluminum metal layer (M1) is patterned and etched for routing electrical signals and grounds. We then deposit and pattern a sacrificial amorphous-Si (a-Si) layer for defining the cantilevers. Next, a stack of aluminum, aluminum nitride, aluminum (Al/AlN/Al) forms the electrodes and piezo-layers for optomechanical actuation. After some buffer oxide, we deposit and etch the SiNx waveguides to form the optical waveguides. We next etch a set of small release holes through the entire stack [Fig. 2(b)], exposing additional a-Si to facilitate device release. Finally, post wafer dicing, a xenon difluoride (XeF2) process removes the a-Si, undercutting all cantilever devices on a single die.\nThe physical mechanisms that contribute to the optical phase shift is primarily due to waveguide path length deformations induced by applying voltages across the piezo-layer, in addition to stress-optic effects.35 Using finite-element models (COMSOL\nAPL Photon. 7, 051304 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0088424 7, 051304-2\n\u00a9 2022 The MITRE Corporation\n19 January 2024 00:29:25\nMultiphysics\u00ae) of our cantilever geometry, we calculate the displacement tensor \u2207u, defined as the gradient of the mechanical displacement vector field u, for a given applied voltage V s. Integrating the displacement tensor along the meandering waveguide path [Fig. 2(a)], which we define as a curve C, we find the path length change \u0394L to be\n\u0394L = \u222b C ds s\u0302 \u22c5 \u2207u \u22c5 s\u0302, (1)\nwhere s\u0302 is the unit vector parallel to the path C. This length deformation then induces a phase shift\n\u03b8 = 2\u03c0neff \u0394L/\u03bb, (2)\nwhere neff = 1.68 is the effective modal index of our waveguide. Based on our simulations, for an h = 30 \u03bcm overhang cantilever at V s = 10 V, we estimate a total \u0394L = 0.89 nm for a single waveguide loop,\ncorresponding to \u03b8 \u223c 0.004\u03c0 radians at 737 nm wavelength. We note that at lower wavelengths, the phase-shifter becomes more effective, ultimately limited by the transparency window of our SiNx. We also find in the linear elastic regime (applicable for the small strain values present in our system) that \u0394L scales approximately linearly with cantilever overhang h and the number of waveguide loops NL.\nThe induced phase shift\u2019s dependence on the cantilever and waveguide geometric parameters h and NL allows for a trade-off between device size, operating voltage, optical losses, and mechanical resonance frequency. Accordingly, we design two different cantilever geometries: design 1 is a high-displacement cantilever, optimized for DC, low voltage operation with a lower peak mechanical frequency, while design 2 is a low-displacement cantilever, optimized for AC, fast switching with a higher peak mechanical frequency. Table I summarizes the geometries and measured characteristics of the two devices based on experiments described in Sec. III."

For the experiments in this section, we apply an AC signal to modulate phase shifter \u03b81 only, while the other phase shifter \u03b82 is set to a specific DC bias point depending on the measurement.\nThe switching behavior of our modulator is characterized by applying various switch signals. Here, the phase \u03b82 is biased such that the modulator turns \u201con\u201d and \u201coff\u201d as \u03b81 is modulated. When a simple square wave is applied [Fig. 4(a)], we observe many excited mechanical resonances, including a long-lived oscillation at \u223c23 MHz. The high frequency components in the sharp square edge can be suppressed by tailoring a smoothed (hyperbolic tangent) switch signal, resulting in a clean transition with a 250 ns rise time [Fig. 4(b)] more suitable for applications requiring faster time scales.\nWe next measure the modulator\u2019s frequency transfer function using small-signal (0.5 V pk\u2013pk) sinusoids on \u03b81 while setting \u03b82 to the maximum slope of the MZI\u2019s amplitude response for enhanced contrast.

We show two lower order resonances at 1.8 and 4.4 MHz [Fig. 5(b)], simulated on a cantilever subsection, to illustrate the mechanical deformations. The number of ripples along the free-hanging portion of the cantilever increases for the higher frequency eigenmodes. We note that the measured resonance peaks are similar to those observed in other piezo-electronic systems.37,38\nThe presence of cantilever mechanical eigenmodes particular to each phase shifter allows for the resonances to greatly enhance the phase shift per voltage response. We focus on the peak mode at 23.3 MHz, for which the mechanical ripples and the waveguide loops are spatially aligned approximately in a 1:1 ratio. We record a time-resolved trace of the cross port output while applying sine waves at 20 MHz (off-resonance) and 23 MHz (on-resonance) to \u03b81 [Fig. 5(c)]. A large enhancement (\u223c15 dB) of the modulator response is seen due to the mechanical resonance effects. By adjusting the amplitude of the applied sine wave until the modulator output saturates, we measure the single cantilever V\u03c0 to be 0.8 V. The total SiNx waveguide length for design 2 is 3.62 mm, corresponding to a V\u03c0L of 0.3 V cm (or 0.15 V cm for two cantilevers in differential operation). Comparing the resonant V\u03c0 to the static V\u03c0 of a single cantilever (36 V) for design 2 (see supplementary material), the mechanical Q is estimated to be \u223c40.

The robustness of our fabrication process enables reliable cantilever performance and engineering of several important device parameters, including peak resonance frequency and V\u03c0 . We characterize additional cantilevers with varying overhang lengths from three different batches of wafers. Figures 6(a) and 6(b) show the measured single-loop V\u03c0 values at DC and peak cantilever resonance, respectively. Each data point is the average of three to five different cantilever modulators, with \u00b11 standard deviation error bars shown. Based on a leastsquares fit, both the DC V\u03c0 and peak mechanical resonance fR have a predictable inverse relationship with cantilever overhang, given by\nV\u03c0 = aV/(NLh), (3)\nfR = aR/h, (4)\nwhere h is the cantilever overhang, NL is the number of waveguide loops, and aV and aR are the slope coefficients of the V\u03c0 and peak resonance equations, respectively. We calculate aV and aR to be 42.7 V mm-loops and 1.81 MHz mm, respectively. From Eqs. (3) and (4), the critical parameters of V\u03c0 and fR are quickly estimated by simply dividing a by the cantilever overhang and in the case of V\u03c0 , further divided by the number of waveguide loops. Unlike V\u03c0 , the peak mechanical resonance of the cantilever does not strongly depend on the number of waveguide loops. This behavior is explained by the resonance mode deformations [Fig. 5(b)], which is affected predominantly by the density of loops (nominally constant across all measured devices) over the cantilever area.\nDespite the overall predictability of device performance, we see that the error bars in Fig. 6 increase as the cantilever overhang lengths get smaller. We attribute this effect to the smaller devices\u2019 increased sensitivity to fabrication variations. This uncertainty applies strongly to the V\u03c0 measurements and, to a lesser degree, the resonance frequency measurements. However, these MHz-range mechanical resonance frequencies maintain an uncertainty of less than one linewidth from the measured devices, making\nAPL Photon. 7, 051304 (2022); doi: 10.1063/5.0088424 7, 051304-5\n\u00a9 2022 The MITRE Corporation\n19 January 2024 00:29:25\nthem more robust to fabrication variations compared to typical optical resonance structures.39\nThe broad ranges in operating voltage and bandwidth available to our cantilever modulator by simply adjusting parameters h and NL allow for the engineering of larger photonic meshes to application-specific needs.

Optogenetics41 and display technologies42 would not require >1 MHz responses and would be well served by a larger cantilever with lower actuation voltage and power consumption. Other applications, such as optical switches and optical neural networks,43 would benefit from shorter cantilevers with >10 MHz resonance frequencies for high-speed reconfiguration. Moreover, quantum network switches likely prefer modulators with shorter waveguides and low optical loss at the expense of higher drive voltages. Finally, driving multiple engineered cantilevers on-resonance would be beneficial for phased arrays and light ranging applications,44,45 which require fast and cyclical control of many output beams.\nSUPPLEMENTARY MATERIAL\nSee the supplementary material for additional device performance data."
