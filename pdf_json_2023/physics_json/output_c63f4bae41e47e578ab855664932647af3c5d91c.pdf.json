    "abstractText": "The solution casting technique is utilized to fabricate blank and CuO-doped polyvinyl alcohol/chitosan (PVA/CS) blends for eco-friendly applications. The structure and surface morphologies of prepared samples were explored by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectrophotometry and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), respectively. FT-IR analysis reveals the incorporation of CuO particles within the PVA/CS structure. SEM analysis exposes the well-dispersion of CuO particles in the host medium. The linear/nonlinear optical characteristics were found on the basis of UV-visible-NIR measurements. The transmittance of the PVA/CS decreases upon CuO increasing to 20.0 wt%. The optical bandgap (Eg dir./Eg ind.) decreases from 5.38/4.67 eV (blank PVA/CS) to 3.72/3.12 eV (20.0 wt% CuO-PVA/CS). An obvious improvement in the optical constants of the PVA/CS blend is achieved by CuO doping. The Wemple-DiDomenico (WDD) and Sellmeier oscillator models were utilized to examine the CuO role dispersion behavior of the PVA/CS blend. The optical analysis shows clear enrichment of the optical parameters of the PVA/CS host. The novel findings in the current study nominate CuO-doped PVA/CS films for applications in linear/nonlinear optical devices.",

            "text": "Polymeric composites have received great attention because of their effective role in various applications, including the industrial, biological, medical, shielding and entertainment fields [1\u20135]. Polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polyvinyl pyrrolidone (PVP), chitosan (CS), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and polyethylene glycol (PEG) possess many attractive features over the rest of polymers, such as non-toxicity, water-solubility, bio-compatibility, eco-friendly and degradability [6\u20138]. Polymeric composites (PCs) are mainly produced by doping small amounts of fillers in a host polymeric matrix for such an application while blending two polymers or more is another scientific trend to yield new polymeric hosts with specific characteristics for updated applications. Particularly, PVA and CS polymers could be blended to produce a novel polymeric host for a lot of applications. PVA possesses high transmittance Vis/NIR regions and a broad bandgap (5.40 eV). Moreover, the hydroxyl groups (\u2014OH) attached to its carbon-chain backbone perform as a hydrogen bonding source that enhances the complexation process [9], while CS, as chitin\u2019s derivative, is the most available polymer that exists in nature [10]. CS could play a dominant role in medical issues because of its unique biocompatibility, antifungal and antimicrobial activities [11]. Mixing PVA and CS produces a PVA/CS polymeric blend to serve as a novel host for various kinds of dopants. Lots of former works related to PCs are found in the literature. For example, the Heiba research group made great progress using CdS/Mg nanostructures (NPs) on the enhancement of optical characteristics of PVA/CMC.

The microstructure of the PVA/CMC/graphene oxide blend was modified via doping with Fe3O4 NPs for energy storage issues by Alsulami and Rajeh [13]. Moreover, the optical constants of the PVA/CS blend were enhanced by filling it with graphene/Fe2O3 for energy storage applications [14]. The Pashameah group concluded that the electrical performance of PVA/CMC was enhanced by MnO2 incorporation for optoelectronic applications [15]. The Norouzi research group showed that a PVA/CS blend adapted with TiO2/graphene oxide or carbon quantum dots could improve wound healing [16]. Similarly, Venkataprasanna et al. concluded that a CuOfilled CS/PVA/graphene oxide blend could be effectively applied for wound healing [17]. Furthermore, the storage modulus and glass transition temperature of CS were greatly enhanced by Fe2O3 NPs. This work focuses on the enhancement of microstructure and linear/nonlinear optical performance of PVA/CS via CuO doping for eco-friendly applications. Copper oxide is preferred as a filler in the PVA/CS blend because of its non-toxicity, abundance, low cost, chemical stability and environmental friendliness. Moreover, its biocompatibility and high antibacterial activities qualify CuO PCs for a lot of medical and daily applications. In addition, CuO\u2019s relatively small optical bandgap (1.2 eV) and large optical absorption coefficient could play a potential role as a filler for LEDs, solar cells, energy storage and other optoelectronic applications. For that, different CuO contents doped in PVA/CS blend were prepared with the solution casting method. The modification in PVA/CS blend structure due to CuO doping was examined by a Fourier transforms infrared (FT-IR) spectrophotometer. The surface morphology was investigated using scanning electron microscopy. Linear/nonlinear optical constants have been investigated based on UV/Vis/NIR data. The obtained investigations reveal the suitability of CuO-doped PVA/CS films for various linear/nonlinear optical applications such as LEDs, fast communications and energy storage devices."

To perform the process, starting sources of PVA (M. W.: 85,000 g\u00b7mol\u22121), chitosan (CS) in powder form (\u226575% deacetylated) and copper oxide (CuO; purity > 99.0%) were obtained from Sigma-Aldrich Co. (St. Louis, MO, USA). First, at 70 \u25e6C, 7.5 PVA grams were dissolved in 250 mL of double distilled water (DDW) for 4 h. In parallel, 2.5 CS grams were dissolved in acetic acid/DDW/(1:9) at 25 \u25e6C for 24 h. Both solutions were mixed for 4 h until a homogenous PVA/CS blend (3:1) was achieved. Next, certain amounts of CuO powder were blended to prepare CuO-doped PVA/CS blends. Afterward, the different CuO-PVA/CS blends were cast in Petri dishes for one day at 55 \u25e6C. Next, the samples were peeled out and marked by C0 (blank blend) to C20.0 (20.0 wt% of CuO-PVA/CS blend). A digital micrometer was used to measure films\u2019 thickness and found 0.18 \u00b1 0.01 mm.

It is noticed that at any certain \u03bb, T decreases in visible-NIR regions as the CuO content is increased from 0 to 20 wt%. For example, the T of the blank PVA/CS film is more than 80% in the visible region, while it\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2391 6 of 20\ndecreases to about 3% for 20 wt% of CuO-PVA/CS film in the same region. Moreover, as the CuO content is increased from 0 to 20 wt%, the UV cut-off edge is red-shifted to longer wavelengths from 225 nm to 358 nm. This valuable result nominates the possible role of CuO-PVA/CS films in UV-shielding applications. In contrast, the absorption increases due to the increase of CuO contents. In addition, clear redshifts in the absorption edges are noticed. Furthermore, two absorption peaks at 211 nm and 258 nm are detected in all absorption spectra that correspond to the PVA electronic \u03c0\u2192 \u03c0* transitions [42], whereas the absorption edge detected at 324 nm refers to the electronic n\u2192 \u03c0* transitions [43]. The decrease in the optical transmittance and hence increment in the absorption amounts due to CuO doping is attributed to the increase in defects (shown below), which leads to a decrease in the optical band gap of the PVA/CS blend, as discussed in Figure 4. Based on Tauc\u2019s equation (Equation (1)), direct/indirect optical bandgap (Eg dir./Eg ind.) of blank and CuO-PVA/CS films has been obtained from (\u03b1h\u03bd)2 and (\u03b1h\u03bd)1/2 curves vs. h\u03bd, respectively, as depicted (Figure 4). The x-axis intercepts of extrapolated linear parts of these curves to h\u03bd = 0 equal Eg values as listed in Table 2. The obtained Eg dir./Eg ind. values of blank PVA/CS film are 5.38 eV and 4.67 eV. These values are well-consistent with the reported ones [34,44]. The Eg dir./Eg ind. values of CuO-PVA/CS films decrease to 3.72 eV and 3.12 eV as CuO concentration is upraised to 20 wt%. Moreover, it is clear that both 0.5 wt% and 1.0 wt% CuO-PVA/CS films possess second bandgap values of 4.79 eV and 4.57 eV, respectively, as illustrated in Figure 4a. This finding reveals that the absorption happens as a result of charge transfer between two different energy levels. The first transition occurs between the molecular orbits of the host matrix, while the other electronic transition takes place between the created energy state due to CuO particles and those of the host matrix. Similar findings were recorded in previous works [21,45]. So, the Eg narrowing mainly results due to localized states and defects created between the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of the PVA/CS blend due to CuO doping [42,46]. Similarly, Heiba et al. concluded that 4 wt% of Cd0.9Mg0.1S nanofillers led to a reduction in the Eg of PVA/CMC blend from 5.4 eV to 5.02 eV [44]. Additionally, the Eg of the PVA/CMC/GO blend was reduced to 3.34 eV using 1.0 wt% of Fe3O4 doping [13].

The increase in Eu indicates the growth of localized states and defects that works as trapping centers in the forbidden region of the PVA/CS host [48]. Similar evidence is reported in the literature [13,25,49]. As an original result, the optical bandgap of PVA/CS is tailored by CuO doping for a lot of optical and environmental applications. The optical performance of such material is mainly established by investigating the refractive index (n* = n-iK) to dictate its applications. The real (n) and imaginary (K) parts describe the dispersion behavior of the electromagnetic wave within the material. Both n and K at the swept wavelength (\u03bb) are calculated using Equations (3) and (4), respectively. The wavelength dependence of n and K of blank and CuO-PVA/CS films are illustrated in Figure 6a,b, respectively. According to Figure 6a, it is noted that n follows the absorbance performance (Figure 3b). In other words, n decreases steeply upon raising \u03bb in the UV region, whereas it remains semi-steady in Vis/NIR regions. Moreover, it is seen that the n of PVA/CS is enhanced as a result of CuO doping, which proposes it for updated applications in optical and optoelectronic devices. For instance, n increases from 1.2 (blank PVA/CS) to 2.25 (20 wt% CuO-PVA/CS) at 650 nm. The improvement in the n value refers to the growth in the films\u2019 density and intermolecular bonds due to CuO doping [27,50,51], whereas n remains quasi-steadily in low photons energy due to films\u2019 restricted absorbance in this\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2391 8 of 20\nregion, whereas, according to Figure 6b, K declines with increasing \u03bb in the UV region, whereas it increases gradually in visible-NIR regions. Furthermore, K increases as the CuO content is increased. These findings could be understood on the basis of the increment of the dispersion as a result of the reflectance increase due to defects\u2019 growth [51].

The real (n) and imaginary (K) parts\ndescribe the dispersion behavior of the electromagnetic wave within the material. Both n\nand K at the swept wavelength (\u03bb) are calculated using Equations (3) and (4), respectively.\nThe wavelength dependence of n and K of blank and CuO-PVA/CS films are illustrated in\nFigure 6a,b, respectively. According to Figure 6a, it is noted that n follows the absorbance\nperformance (Figure 3b). In other words, n decreases steeply upon raising \u03bb in the UV\nregion, whereas it remains semi-steady in Vis/NIR regions. Moreover, it is seen that the n\nof PVA/CS is enhanced as a result of CuO doping, which proposes it for updated applica-\ntions in optical and optoelectronic devices. For instance, n increases from 1.2 (blank\nPVA/CS) to 2.25 (20 wt% CuO-PVA/CS) at 650 nm. The improvement in the n value refers\nto the growth in the films\u2019 density and intermolecular bonds due to CuO doping\n[27,50,51], whereas n remains quasi-steadily in low photons energy due to films\u2019 restricted\nabsorbance in this region, whereas, according to Figure 6b, K declines with increasing \u03bb\nin the UV region, whereas it increases gradually in visible-NIR regions. Furthermore, K\nincreases as the CuO content is increased. These findings could be understood on the basis\nof the increment of the dispersion as a result of the reflectance increase due to defects\u2019\ngrowth [51].\nFigure 5. ln\u03b1 vs. h\u03bd of CuO-PVA/CS films.\nBased on the absorption coefficient \u03b1 and n, \u03c3opt. of CuO-PVA/CS samples was determined (Equation (5)) and illustrated in Figure 7. It is observed that \u03c3opt. of the films behaves in a similar way to the optical absorbance (Figure 3b). As \u03bb is red-shifted to longer values in the UV region, \u03c3opt. decreases steeply, while it behaves steadily in the Vis/NIR regions. In contrast, \u03c3opt. increases upon increasing the CuO content in the PVA/CS host. For example, at 650 nm, \u03c3opt. enhances from 2.56 \u00d7 1010 s\u22121 (blank PVA/CS) to 9.85 \u00d7 1010 s\u22121 (20 wt CuO-PVA/CS). The \u03c3opt. enhancement is understood on the basis of the increment in created electrons as a result of the absorption increase of the incident photons [27,52]. The increase in absorption is also reinforced by the growth in the defects, as discussed in Eu findings. These findings are very consistent with reported data [21,53,54]. Shamekh et al. proved that \u03c3opt. of PVA was pronouncedly enhanced by MgO doping. The dielectric parameters (\u03b5r and \u03b5i), together with the surface/volume energy loss functions (SELF/VELF) of the blank and CuO-PVA/CS films, have been determined. These constants are investigated to nominate their possible participation in many fields as superconductors and energy storage devices. \u03b5r associates with traveling wave dispersions within such material, while \u03b5i relates to the dissipated energy rate through their propagation [21]. \u03b5r, \u03b5i, SELF and VELF were calculated by Equations (6) to (9) and presented in Figure 8a\u2013d, respectively. According to \u03b5r spectra (Figure 8a), it follows the refractive index n performance. \u03b5r decreases steeply as \u03bb is red-shifted in the UV region, whereas it remains semi-constant in the visible-NIR regions. Furthermore, \u03b5r rises as CuO content is increased to 20 wt%. For example, \u03b5r enhanced from 1.43 (blank PVA/CS) to 5.08 (20 wt% CuO-PVA/CS) at \u03bb = 650 nm. The enhancement in \u03b5r results due to the increase in the dispersion as a result of a defects increase (Urbach energy findings). On the other hand, the imaginary part \u03b5i of the film performs similarly to the extinction coefficient K (Figure 6b). \u03b5i decreases greatly as \u03bb increases in the UV region, while it increases slowly in Vis/NIR region for small CuO contents (\u22645 wt%) and increases pronouncedly for the high CuO contents (10 and 20 wt%). Moreover, \u03b5i increases as the CuO content is raised. This behavior refers to polarization and dipole motion fluctuations [26,55,56]. Similar findings are reported in the literature [26,57,58]. Moreover, it is noticed that SELF and VELF spectra perform in a similar way. Both SELF and VELF values increase noticeably as \u03bb is red-shifted\nPolymers 2023, 15, 2391 10 of 20\nto longer wavelengths in the Vis/NIR regions. Moreover, it is noted that at any \u03bb, the VELF value is larger than the SELF value, which indicates that the energy loss by the traveling electrons within the films due to the doped CuO particles is larger than those traveling on their surfaces. In addition, both SELF and VELF increased upon increasing the CuO contents. This increment in SELF and VELF refers to growth in vacant energy levels generated in the host band gap [59]. Similar behavior is noticed El-naggar et al. [26]. They showed SELF and VELF increase of the PVA/PVP upon increasing SnS2/Fe concentration.

It is obvious that all optical behaviors of the PVA/CS blend are altered with CuO doping. For example, \u03b5\u221e of the blank PVA/CS film is greatly enhanced from 1.35 to 3.94 (20 wt% CuO-PVA/CS film). The enhancement in \u03b5L and \u03b5\u221e refers to the dispersion lattice vibrations as a result of CuO particles [37]. Similar \u03b5L and \u03b5\u221e findings related to polystyrene filled with manganese (III) chloride were found by Al-Muntaser et al. [37], while N/m* of the blank PVA/CS film is duplicated due to 20 wt% of CuO doping. This result is reasonable as a result of the increment of the free carriers due to CuO doping [21]. Our results are compatible with the literature [61,62]. The nonlinear optical behavior of blank and CuO-PVA/CS samples is explored to recommend their probable applications in nonlinear optical devices. Optical materials with the optical nonlinearity character play an effective role in many applications such as ultrafast lasing switching, frequency converters and telecommunications [21,63]. The nonlinear optical response arises because of the nonlinear polarization that occurs owing to intense electromagnetic wave exposure [21,64,65]. Based on Equations (16) to (18), \u03c7(1), \u03c7(3) and n2 are calculated and presented in Figure 10a\u2013c, respectively. It is noted that \u03c7(1), \u03c7(3) and n2 behave semi-steadily in the Vis/NIR regions, whereas they rise rapidly upon increasing h\u03bd in the UV region. In addition, as the CuO content is increased to 20 wt%, \u03c7(1), \u03c7(3) and n2 increase noticeably. For instance, at 4.0 eV, \u03c7(1) of the blank PVA/CS film is enhanced from 0.17 esu to 1.36 esu via 20 wt% CuO doping, while \u03c7(3) and n2 of the blank film are enhanced about by three-order of magnitude at the same incident photons energy. These findings are compatible with previous works [25,26,64]. For example, the Ali group found that the nonlinear optical constant of PVA was enhanced pronouncedly by fullerene doping [25].

            "text": "The solution casting method was followed to fabricate blank and CuO doped in polyvinyl alcohol/chitosan (PVA/CS) blends. The effect of CuO concentrations (0, 0.5, 1.0, 5.0, 10.0 and 20.0 wt%) on PVA/CS structure and linear/nonlinear optical characteristics is discussed in detail. Scanning electron microscope examinations disclose obvious changes in the surface morphologies of PVA/CS film owing to CuO doping. FT-IR measurements prove noticeable modifications in PVA/CS structure due to CuO doping. Noticeable modifications in absorption band\u2019s locations and intensities of CuO-PVA/CS films as compared with the blank one. The linear/nonlinear optical parameters were discussed. The transmittance of the PVA/CS blend reduces as a result of CuO increasing to 20.0 wt%. The optical bandgap (Eg dir./Eg ind.) decreases from 5.38/4.67 eV (blank PVA/CS) to 3.72/3.12 eV (20.0 wt% CuO-PVA/CS). This decrease in the optical bandgap is interpreted in terms of defects and created states, as verified by Urbach energy investigations. The refractive index, optical conductivity and dielectric constants of PVA/CS are clearly enhanced due to CuO doping, which nominates it for updated applications in optoelectronic devices. The CuO doping role in the dispersion performance of PVA/CS has been investigated using a single oscillator and Sellmeier oscillator relations. For instance, the infinite dielectric constant is greatly enhanced from 1.35 (blank PVA/CS) to 3.94 (20 wt% CuO-PVA/CS film), whereas the concentration of free carriers/effective mass of blank PVA/CS film is duplicated. The nonlinear optical parameters of PVA/CS are also enhanced via CuO doping. \u03c7(3) and n2 are improved by about three orders-of-magnitude at 4.0 eV incident photons energy. These novel findings nominate CuO-PVA/CS films for updated optical applications.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, S.S.A. and A.B.; methodology, S.S.A. and A.B.; software, S.S.A.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, A.B.; writing\u2014review and editing, S.S.A. and A.B.; funding, A.B.
