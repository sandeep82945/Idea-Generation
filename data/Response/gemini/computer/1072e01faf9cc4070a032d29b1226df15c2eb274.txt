1. **Investigate the use of advanced cryptographic techniques** to enhance the security of the watermarking scheme. This could include exploring the use of homomorphic encryption or secure multi-party computation to protect the watermark during the embedding and extraction processes.


2. **Develop a more efficient watermarking algorithm** that can be applied to larger and more complex models without significantly impacting the model's performance. This could involve exploring the use of lightweight watermarking techniques or developing new algorithms that are specifically designed for federated learning.


3. **Explore the use of federated learning to improve the robustness of the watermarking scheme**. This could involve using federated learning to train a model that is specifically designed to detect and remove watermarks, and then using this model to attack the watermarking scheme. The results of this research could be used to develop new watermarking schemes that are more robust against attacks.


4. **Investigate the use of watermarking to protect the privacy of the data used in federated learning**. This could involve embedding a watermark into the data before it is shared with the other participants in the federated learning process. This watermark could then be used to track the data and prevent it from being used for unauthorized purposes.


5. **Develop a theoretical framework for analyzing the security and privacy of watermarking schemes in federated learning**. This framework could be used to compare the security and privacy of different watermarking schemes and to develop new watermarking schemes that are more secure and private.
