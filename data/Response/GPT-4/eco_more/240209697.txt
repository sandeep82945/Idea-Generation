Regulatory Impact Analysis Across Different Market Structures: Investigating how different market structures (monopoly, oligopoly, monopolistic competition) influence the effectiveness of privacy regulations. This research could provide nuanced insights into how the scale and market power of platforms affect regulatory outcomes, exploring beyond the dichotomy of high-cost and low-cost platforms.

Advanced Privacy-Preserving Technologies: Exploring the role of emerging technologies (e.g., blockchain, zero-knowledge proofs) in enhancing user privacy without significantly compromising the utility derived from data sharing. This research could focus on the technical feasibility and economic implications of these technologies in the data market model.

User Data Valuation Mechanisms: Developing mechanisms for more accurate valuation of user data, incorporating factors such as data uniqueness, relevance, and temporal value. This research could lead to a better understanding of data pricing strategies and their impact on the market dynamics outlined in the study.

Cross-market Effects of Data Sharing Regulations: Investigating how regulations in one data market (e.g., social media) affect other related markets (e.g., e-commerce, online advertising). This research could uncover unintended consequences of regulations and suggest holistic approaches to policy-making.

Behavioral Economics of Data Sharing Decisions: Incorporating behavioral economics principles to study how users perceive privacy loss and make decisions regarding data sharing. This research could challenge the rational actor model assumed in the paper and offer insights into designing more effective user-centric privacy protections.
