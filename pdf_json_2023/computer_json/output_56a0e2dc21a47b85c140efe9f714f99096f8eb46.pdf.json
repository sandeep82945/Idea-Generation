    "abstractText": "ABSTRACT One of the key goals of power electronics is to reduce losses in three-phase converters in order to increase efficiency and reduce thermal stress, which can lengthen the lifetime of devices. However, the aforementioned studies do not account for the fact that the phase legs of the converter can experience various aging conditions, which reduces the expected lifetime of converter. This paper proposes a minimum loss perphase method based on predictive control for voltage source inverter, which aims at particularly reducing loss of specific phase leg to increase the lifetime of the entire converter. The output currents will be controlled using predicted reference voltages and predictive zero-sequence voltage injection in the proposed technique. The particular phase leg, which is the most aged leg, will be clamped to the positive and negative dc-link to generate a non-switching region. This will result in the reduction of switching frequency and switching loss of the most aged phase leg in the voltage source inverter, which prolongs the lifetime of the particular phase leg and entire converter. The results of simulation and experimentation are used to confirm the validity of the proposed method and effectiveness in increasing lifetime of converter, where the switching loss of the most aged leg is reduced by up to 85%, and corresponding lifetime increases by about four times compared to the conventional model predictive control method.",

However, the aforementioned studies do not account for the fact that the phase legs of the converter can experience various aging conditions, which reduces the expected lifetime of converter. This paper proposes a minimum loss perphase method based on predictive control for voltage source inverter, which aims at particularly reducing loss of specific phase leg to increase the lifetime of the entire converter. The output currents will be controlled using predicted reference voltages and predictive zero-sequence voltage injection in the proposed technique. The particular phase leg, which is the most aged leg, will be clamped to the positive and negative dc-link to generate a non-switching region. This will result in the reduction of switching frequency and switching loss of the most aged phase leg in the voltage source inverter, which prolongs the lifetime of the particular phase leg and entire converter. The results of simulation and experimentation are used to confirm the validity of the proposed method and effectiveness in increasing lifetime of converter, where the switching loss of the most aged leg is reduced by up to 85%, and corresponding lifetime increases by about four times compared to the conventional model predictive control method.\nINDEX TERMS switching loss, model predictive control, per-phase, thermal reduction, lifetime\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe two-level three-phase voltage source inverter (VSI) is a well-liked power converter that has a wide range of applications, including uninterruptible power supply, back-toback converters in wind turbine systems, and electric drive systems [1-4]. This converter topology is widely recognized, trustworthy, and relatively easy to control. The most vulnerable parts of a power converter are the dc-link capacitor accounting for 30%, whereas power semiconductors are 21% of components. The main source of stress in power semiconductors is a high temperature, which is caused by power semiconductor losses [5-8]. One of the main reasons for power module failure, according to research, is thermal stress. Thermal stress, which is caused by power loss, speeds up the deterioration of semiconductor devices and reduces the system's dependability. From several previous studies and data surveys, the deterioration of the power converter's components,\nparticularly the power modules, is mostly caused by thermal stress, which ultimately leads to the power converter's failure. One of the most susceptible parts of the power converter is the power circuit, which is constructed using a number of semiconductor devices. The thermal stress indicated previously is the main root of failure [5], [9], and [10]. During the operation, the semiconductor devices conduct and switch at high current, which causes a substantial power loss. At the chip junction, a significant quantity of heat is stored as a result of this loss accumulation. The junction temperature rapidly increases in this manner. Bond cables, soldering layers, and direct-bond copper, among other materials inside the power module, repeatedly undergo temperature rises and falls and endure mechanical changes at various coefficients of thermal expansion. The interface may experience crack and void problems that grow until an unanticipated separation is created. Different failure modes are specified based on the location of\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

Conduction losses, leakage current losses, and switching losses all raise the temperature of the switching components. Static losses that are dependent on device technology include conduction losses and leakage current losses. Alternatively, altering the switching frequency might affect switching losses in addition to other variables. Therefore, reducing switching losses to keep the thermal stress as small as possible is a crucial target, which leads to an increased lifetime of the converter [11, 12].\nThe three main methods for reducing switching losses are decreasing the voltage or current of switches during commutation [13-15], adjusting the switching time interval [16-19], or changing the number of commutations in the fundamental period [20-25]. System reliability is decreased by the additional hardware, complexity, and control that softswitching and advanced gate drivers demand [26]. Nevertheless, modulation strategies and switching frequency variation might be improved to reduce thermal stress, which do not need to use additional hardware. The simplest approach to achieve thermal control is to adjust the switching frequency as it has a direct influence on the power switching losses without notably affecting the operating point of the application when adjusted within system constraints. The method in [20, 21] conducts a hysteresis controller using calculated junction temperature variation to reduce switching frequency to its lowest level when the junction temperature variation of switching devices is higher than a certain level. The reduction of switching frequency lowers corresponding switching loss of the entire converter. In [22], the switching sequence with the least number of commutation is selected to reduce the switching loss of the thermal overloading power device. The alternative approaches based on using discontinuous pulsewidth modulation (DPWM) are widely used for reducing switching frequency [23]. The fundamental concept behind DPWM is to clamp the voltage reference of the converter output to either the upper or lower dc-link potential within a specific interval. This ensures that the corresponding power device remains in its current state without switching, leading to a decrease in switching losses within that interval. The switching frequency and corresponding switching loss can be decreased by about 33% and 50%, respectively. The use of DPWM can also be applied to cascaded/paralleled converter system as in [24, 25].\nIn the three-phase converter, each phase leg could have a different aging condition or an expected lifetime, which may be caused by uneven stress during operation or by the failure of a switch and the consequent replacement. Additionally, manufacturing methods have been identified as a potential source of failure for power semiconductor devices. To increase the reliability of the entire VSI, however, the aforementioned active thermal control approaches do not account for the fact that the phase legs of the converter can experience various aging conditions. As indicated earlier, the soft-switching and advanced gate driver techniques require\nadditional hardware, control, and complexity though they can particularly reduce the power loss of specific switches.\nModel predictive control (MPC), a nonlinear control technique, has recently been increasingly used in power electronics control as a result of advancements in microprocessors [27, 28]. A converter topology with a specific level has a finite number of switching states; thus, MPC heuristically chooses the best switching state from among the possibilities by minimizing the objective function. According to authors in [29], a linear low-pass filter can be added to the cost function as a way to reduce power loss when employing MPC. The filter excludes predicted switching states consuming more power to lower thermal stress. Nevertheless, this linear filter, which is very dependent on the problem formulation of MPC, might be incorrect by nonlinear constraints. Therefore, it is not advised to include nonlinear constraints in the objective function. The ability of MPC to simultaneously handle numerous targets is a key benefit [27, 28]. In the conventional MPC method aiming at reducing switching loss, the additional cost function corresponding to the number of switching transitions will be added in addition to other control variables such as output currents, power, etc. [30]. In [31], the authors include various constraints corresponding to thermal stress as device junction temperature spread, power losses, maximum device temperature, etc., in a predicted cost function to control thermal of electric drive converters. However, it leads to the requirement of tuning the weighting factor for each term of cost function, increasing complexity of the method, and the added cost function might decrease the output performance of converter.\nIn this article, a minimum loss per-phase method based predictive control for VSI is introduced to particularly reduce the loss of a specific phase leg, which leads to increases of VSI's lifetime and reliability. Different from conventional MPC, the proposed minimum loss per-phase method based predictive control method uses modified predicted reference voltages to regulate the output current and achieve switching loss reduction in a particular phase leg. A predictive zerosequence voltage is generated and injected to the predictive reference voltage of desired phase leg, which clamps the corresponding phase leg to either positive or negative dc-link rails. It is possible to create a non-switching region without any switching activity by injecting the predictive zerosequence voltage, which prevents the required phase leg from being switched at any instant. The remainder of this article's information is arranged as follows. In Section 2, the conventional MPC used in two-level three-phase VSIs is investigated. For the switching loss reduction strategy, the proposed minimum loss per-phase method-based predictive control is described in Section 3. Simulation and experimental results are presented and analyzed in Section 4. Section 5 evaluates the impact of proposed method on lifetime extension. Finally, Section 6 concludes this article.\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

This system contains a dc-source, a two-level three-phase converter, and a \ud835\udc45 \u2212 \ud835\udc3f load. \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc65 (\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f, \ud835\udc50) is phase output current, and \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc65 (\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f, \ud835\udc50) is the converter voltage. \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc651 and \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc652 (\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f, \ud835\udc50) stand for the upper and lower switching states of the converter leg, respectively.\nFIGURE 1. Typical configuration of two-level three-phase VSI.\nApplying Kirchhoff's law to the VSI circuit, the equations\nfor the load current dynamic can be written as\n\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc65 + \ud835\udc3f \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc61 (\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f, \ud835\udc50) (1)\nThe predictive model is a basic element of predictive current control, which is used to predict the system's future output according to previous information about the object. Hence, to realize the current control strategy, the forward Euler algorithm is applied to (1), and the discrete-time expression of (1) is acquired as\n\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc58 + 1) = (1 \u2212 \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5d\n\ud835\udc3f ) \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc58)\n+ \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5d\n\ud835\udc3f \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc58) (\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f, \ud835\udc50) (2)\nwhere \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5d is the sampling time. In accordance with (2), the converter voltage and current at time instant \ud835\udc58, indicated by \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc58) and \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc58) (\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f, \ud835\udc50) , respectively, determine the current at time instant \ud835\udc58 + 1, \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc58 + 1) (\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f, \ud835\udc50). Since the converter generates a total of eight switching states, the converter voltage \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc58) can be any one of the eight voltage vectors listed in Table I. As a result, any one of the eight current vectors derived using (2) may be predicted to represent the current at time instant \ud835\udc58 + 1, \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc58 + 1) (\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f, \ud835\udc50). A cost function is consequently needed in order to assess the predictions and is defined as follows:\n\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc56 = |\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc65 \u2217(\ud835\udc58 + 1) \u2212 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc58 + 1)| (3)\nwhere the reference current for time instant \ud835\udc58 + 1 is represented by \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc65\n\u2217(\ud835\udc58 + 1) . Determining the switching state that will minimize the cost function specified in (3) and applying it to the converter is how MPCC is implemented. Fig. 2 depicts the control diagram corresponding to MPCC.\nIn traditional MPCC, the goal is to choose a voltage vector that will bring the predicted current \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc58 + 1) as closely as possible to its reference \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc65\n\u2217(\ud835\udc58 + 1) . One may determine predicted reference voltage \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc65\n\u2217(\ud835\udc58) by taking into account the projected current in (2) and then using the following formula. Equation (2) may be changed by substituting \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc58 + 1) with \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc65 \u2217(\ud835\udc58 + 1) , and after rearranging the equation, (4) can be yielded as\n\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc65 \u2217(\ud835\udc58) =\n1\n\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5d {\ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc65\n\u2217 (\ud835\udc58 + 1) + (\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5d \u2212 \ud835\udc3f)\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc58)} (4)\nAs stated in Eq. (4), if the converter voltage acting at time instant \ud835\udc58 can be adjusted to be the same as \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc65 \u2217, then the current \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc58 + 1) will be precisely identical to its reference \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc65 \u2217(\ud835\udc58 + 1). Table I shows available switching states and corresponding converter voltage vectors. Given the cost function below, the current predictive control must thus choose one voltage from a set of eight voltage vectors that satisfies the requirement:\n\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc63 = |\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc65 \u2217(\ud835\udc58) \u2212 \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc58)| (\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f, \ud835\udc50) (5)\nBy calculating which voltage vector is closest to the \"required voltage vector\" \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc65 \u2217(\ud835\udc58), it is possible to determine the switching state that should be applied to the power converter at time instant \ud835\udc58.

            "text": "As for the aforementioned analysis, the phase legs of the power converter might have different aging conditions due to the manufacturing process, uneven thermal stress distribution, and earlier replacement. This leads to the difference in the remaining useful lifetime among phase legs. Because the converter will stop working if one phase leg is broken, it is necessary to increase the remaining useful lifetime of the most aged leg. A basic idea of an increased lifetime of most aged devices is decreasing their specific operating frequency, which results in reducing switching loss. However, the output performance of VSIs might decline with a decrease in switching frequency. Additionally, inappropriately reducing the switching frequency of one phase leg in VSI will deteriorate the output currents. Theoretically, a straightforward strategy is to include a term in the cost function that measures the number of switches that alter when the switching state \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc58) (\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f, \ud835\udc50) changes in order to directly assess the decrease in the number of switching actions. The switching states at time instant \ud835\udc58 is applied with respect to the previously switching state \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc58 \u2212 1) (\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f, \ud835\udc50). The generated cost function can be described as [26]\n\ud835\udc54 = |\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc65 \u2217(\ud835\udc58 + 1) \u2212 \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc58 + 1)| + \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc5b \u00d7 \ud835\udc5b (6)\nwhere \ud835\udc5b is the number of switching actions that change when the switching state \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc58) (\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f, \ud835\udc50) is applied and \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc5b is a weighting factor. The difference of the number of switching actions from time instant \ud835\udc58 \u2212 1 to time instant \ud835\udc58, \ud835\udc5b, is\n\ud835\udc5b = \u2211 |\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc58) \u2212 \ud835\udc46\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc58 \u2212 1)|\n\ud835\udc65=\ud835\udc4e,\ud835\udc4f,\ud835\udc50\n(7)\nThe reduction of switching frequency will increase along with the rise of weighting factor \ud835\udf06\ud835\udc5b value. However, the output current might deteriorate, and the minimum switching loss for a particular phase leg cannot be achieved.\nTo achieve the reduction of switching loss in a particular phase leg of converter without using the additional cost function term corresponding to switching frequency, in this study, the simplified MPC using predicted reference voltage in (4) is modified by adding a predictive zero-sequence voltage. The predictive zero-sequence voltage is produced in\nsuch a way that the particular phase converter reference voltage in (4) with predictive zero-sequence voltage injection connects the corresponding phase to the upper or lower dc-link rail to create the non-switching region. First, the three-phase predicted reference voltages acquired by the voltage model in (4), i.e., \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc4e \u2217(\ud835\udc58), \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc4f \u2217(\ud835\udc58), and \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc50 \u2217(\ud835\udc58), are normalized by dividing them by the peak value. It is possible to acquire the normalization's peak value via\n\ud835\udc49\ud835\udc5d\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc58(\ud835\udc58) = \u221a(\ud835\udc63\ud835\udefc \u2217(\ud835\udc58)) 2 + (\ud835\udc63\ud835\udefd \u2217(\ud835\udc58)) 2\n(8)\nwhere \ud835\udc63\ud835\udefc \u2217(\ud835\udc58) and \ud835\udc63\ud835\udefd \u2217(\ud835\udc58) are the \ud835\udefc and \ud835\udefd components obtained by the \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc4f\ud835\udc50 -to- \ud835\udefc\ud835\udefd transformation. The filtered normalized reference voltages, calculated in (4), are shown in Fig. 4. In this study, phase \ud835\udc4e leg is considered the most aged. The available non-switching region and switching region can be selected on the basis of the instantaneous magnitude of the corresponding phase leg. It can be seen that the available nonswitching region corresponds to the interval that the normalized reference voltage of phase \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4e \u2217 (\ud835\udc58) is \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc65\n\u2217 (\ud835\udc58) or \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b\n\u2217 (\ud835\udc58), where the switching state can be forced to stop changing. Meanwhile, at the available switching region, which relates to the medium voltage \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc51 \u2217 (\ud835\udc58), the phase leg of VSI should be prevented from being clamped to guarantee that VSI operates precisely in the linear modulation range. As shown in the previous studies, adding the same zero-sequence voltage signal to three-phase reference voltages does not change the line-to-line voltage per carrier cycle average value. Therefore, to reduce the switching frequency of phase \ud835\udc4e without deteriorating the output current performance, the predictive zero-sequence voltage \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc49(\ud835\udc58) will be calculated differently following the available non-switching and switching regions of the assumed most aged phase \ud835\udc4e leg as follow:\nIt can be seen from Fig. 4 the maximum angle of the available non-switching region is 120o in each positive or negative dc-link rail. Using (9), the waveforms of filtered reference voltages, the predictive zero-sequence voltage, and\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License. For more information, see https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/\n9\ncorresponding modified reference voltages after adding the predictive zero-sequence voltage are illustrated in Fig. 5. In this case, it should be noted that phase \ud835\udc4e is considered the most aged leg, which needs to reduce its switching frequency to extend the lifetime of phase leg \ud835\udc4e and the entire VSI. Following (9), the generated predictive zero-sequence voltage will be added to three-phase reference voltages. Thus, phase \ud835\udc4e modified reference voltage contains the clamping region of 120o in both positive and negative dc-link rail. Meanwhile, phases \ud835\udc4f and \ud835\udc50 do not contain clamping regions.\nThe different non-switching regions can be realized by modifying (9) by using upper and lower limits for the magnitude of reference phase voltage, as shown in (10). The non-switching region \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc64 will range from 0 o to 120o . If \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc64 = 120 o, (10) will be the same as (9).\nFig. 6 depicts the waveforms of filtered reference voltages, the predictive zero-sequence voltage, and corresponding modified reference voltages after adding the predictive zerosequence voltage obtained from (10) by setting the nonswitching region \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc64 = 60 o . In this case, phase \ud835\udc4e is also considered the most aged leg, which needs to reduce its switching frequency to extend the lifetime of phase leg \ud835\udc4e and\nthe entire VSI. Following (10), the generated predictive zerosequence voltage \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc49(\ud835\udc58) will be added to three-phase reference voltages.

Following [32], the use of the cost function in (16) cannot guarantee the precise selection of switching states corresponding to zero voltage vector. The improper selection of zero voltage vector may result in unwanted switching operations, increasing the switching loss. As a result, the polarity of the predictive zerosequence voltage is taken into consideration while choosing the zero voltage vectors. As in [32], zero voltage vectors \ud835\udc490 and \ud835\udc497 are employed when the predictive zero-sequence voltage \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc49 is negative and positive, respectively. Fig. 8 displays the overall block drawing of the proposed minimum loss per-phase method based predictive control method. As can be seen in Fig. 8, the three-phase predicted reference voltages achieved by the inverse dynamic model in (13), i.e., \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc4e \u2217(\ud835\udc58 + 1) , \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc4f \u2217(\ud835\udc58 + 1) and \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc50 \u2217(\ud835\udc58 + 1) , are normalized by dividing them with the peak value to limit their magnitude within \u00b11.

This part is added to modify the predicted reference voltages for control purpose of reducing switching loss and thermal stress of the most aged leg. It also becomes evident that the proposed minimum loss per-phase method based predictive control technique with offset voltage injection can be implemented without requiring any additional components. Also, it does not need extra information about the load power factor since the algorithm uses the known sampled values of the reference voltage to determine the appropriate switch to clamp for every sampling period. With this proposed MPC strategy, the VSI with the most aged leg can operate with minimum switching losses at any operating point, irrespective of the steady-state or transient conditions.\nThe proposed minimum loss per-phase method based predictive control that uses the cost function selects the optimal switching state, which can generate the optimal output voltage state closest to the modified predicted reference voltage. The predicted reference voltage is modified to ensure clamping of the most aged leg to decrease the corresponding switching loss and guarantee satisfactory output current performance."

Table II displays the two-level three-phase VSI parameter.\nFig. 9 presents the phase output currents and switching patterns waveforms using the conventional MPCC and the proposed minimum loss per-phase method based predictive control with \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc64 = 0 o. It can be observed that the noticeable difference between the two control schemes is the switching pattern. In Fig. 9(a), the conventional MPCC method implemented in this study uses the zero-voltage vector \ud835\udc490 to generate a corresponding zero switching state. When using the traditional MPCC approach, the \ud835\udc65-phase (\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f, \ud835\udc50) clamps to the negative dc-link without switching operations. This\nresults in switching pulse patterns with spontaneous clamping periods. It should be observed that when the conventional MPCC technique uses the zero state \ud835\udc497 , the \ud835\udc65 -phase (\ud835\udc65 = \ud835\udc4e, \ud835\udc4f, \ud835\udc50) clamps to the positive dc-link with the same interval. However, in Fig 9(b), due to the zero-voltage vector is selected following the polarity of predictive zero-sequence voltage \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc4d\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc49 , the resulting switching pattern of the proposed minimum loss per-phase method based predictive control is different from that of the conventional MPCC. Regarding the output performance, the proposed minimum loss per-phase method based predictive control with \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc64 = 0 o produces the sinusoidal and correct phase output currents as the conventional MPCC. The output current correctly follows the corresponding reference current. The total harmonic distortion (THD) findings from the two algorithms are similar to one another, coming in at roughly 3.83%.\n(a)\n5\n0\n-5\n5\n0\n-5\n1\n0\n1\n0\n1\n0\n0.3 0.31 0.32 0.33 0.34 0.35\nTime (s)\nOutput currents (A)\nPhase a output current and reference current\nS1a switching signal\nS1b switching signal\nS1c switching signal\nioa iob ioc\nioa\ni*oa\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

The filtered modified reference voltage of phase \ud835\udc4e and the predictive zero-sequence voltage are presented for clarity.

Fig. 11(a) illustrates the change of output current THD along with the rise of the clamping angle. The clamping angle \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc64 = 30 o has the lowest output current THD compared to other clamping angles. However, the difference in output current THD at various clamping angles\nis negligible. The insignificant change in terms of output current THD can be explained from (4), where it expresses that the output current \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc65(\ud835\udc58 + 1) and its reference \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc65 \u2217(\ud835\udc58 + 1) will be correctly identical if the converter voltage vector acting at time instant \ud835\udc58 can be managed to the same as the predicted reference voltage \ud835\udc63\ud835\udc65 \u2217 . However, it leads to an increase in switching loss in the two remaining phase legs. It can be noticed by observing Fig. 11(a) and 11(b), the switching frequency of phase \ud835\udc4e is significantly decreased thanks to the non-switching region, where the reduction of switching frequency is about 75%. Meanwhile, the switching frequency of the two remaining phases increases by about 50%. Fig. 11(c) shows the change of phase \ud835\udc4e conduction loss and switching loss following the change of clamping angle. When the clamping angle is lower than 60o, the switching loss of phase \ud835\udc4e decreases along with the increase of clamping angle. The switching loss does not decrease anymore when the clamping angle is higher than 60o. Additionally, the conduction loss has a minor increase due to the reduction of switching loss. Although the switching loss of phase \ud835\udc4e reduces significantly, the total loss of VSI following the change of clamping angle varies slightly due to the increase of loss in two remaining phase legs.\n(a)\n(b)\n3.83\n3.77\n3.79\n3.84 3.84\n0 30 60 90 120\n3.5\n3.6\n3.7\n3.8\n3.9\n4.0\nT H\nD (\n% )\nClamping angle (degree)\nOutput current THD\nOutput current THD at different clamping angle\n3734\n2436\n1024 952 928\n3602\n4880\n5728 5662 5686\n3662\n4852\n5580 5592 5602\n0 30 60 90 120\n1E+3\n2E+3\n3E+3\n4E+3\n5E+3\n6E+3\nS w\nit c h\nin g\nf re\nq u\ne n\nc y (\nH z )\nClamping angle (degree)\nPhase a Phase b Phase c\nPhase switching frequency at different clamping angle\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

The proposed method with the clamping angle \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc64 = 120 o is used for comparison. It is seen that the proposed method can decrease the switching loss of a particular phase by 85% compared to the conventional MPCC approach. The conduction loss of the proposed method slightly increases compared to the conventional method. In terms of VSI total loss, the difference between the two control schemes is negligible. Thus, the proposed method can achieve the minimum loss for a particular phase leg."

However, when the unbalanced condition of increasing \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc50 by 50% (\u2206\ud835\udc45 = 50), the capability of switching frequency reduction of the proposed MPC method is significantly degraded. It can be seen that the phase \ud835\udc4e switching frequency and switching loss at this unbalanced condition increase by about 1.8 and 2.3 times respectively compared to balanced condition (\u2206\ud835\udc45 = 0), as shown in Fig. 32(b) and (c). The effect of unbalanced load on error of load current is shown in Fig. 32(d). The error of load current increases when the load of phase \ud835\udc4e increase.\n(a)\nIt can conclude that the proposed MPC can correctly regulate output currents under unbalanced load conditions. However, the capability of switching frequency reduction is degraded when the load resistance is higher than the equivalent value, especially the unbalanced load at the most aged leg.\nOutput currents (A)\n5\n0\n-5\n5\n0\n-5\n0.8 0.82 0.83 0.850.81\nPhase a output current and reference current\nioa iob ioc\nioa\nirefa\n0.84\n1\n0\nSa1 switching signal\nTime (s)\n-\n-\ns t t t f t\n3.99 3.98 4.01\n4.17\n3.95\n4.06 4.01\n4.08\n4.07 3.98\n-50 -25 0 25 50\n3.0\n3.5\n4.0\n4.5\n5.0\nT H\nD (\n% )\nDR in percent (%)\nOutput current THD\nPhase a Average\nThis work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 License.

Although the switching loss in the two remaining phase leg increases, it does not exert negative impact on the two-level three-phase VSI when the most aged leg still can be prolonged its lifetime and delayed its failure until the next maintenance. Additionally, the increase of switching frequency in the two remaining phase leg will lead to the balance of aging condition between three phase legs. The proposed MPC method uses only a single cost function corresponding to reference voltages, so the proposed method is straightforward to implement and does not need the weighting factor tuning procedure and additional hardware.\nV. IMPACT OF THE PROPOSED METHOD ON LIFETIME\nAs indicated earlier, the primary cause of failure of the power semiconductor devices is thermal stress, which reduces the lifetime of corresponding devices and entire converter. Hence, this section is introduced to determine how the application of the proposed MPC method is affecting the lifetime consumption of the power semiconductor devices. To calculate the lifetime of switching devices, analytical models, which are well-known to describe the dependence of the number of cycles to failure Nf on the parameters of temperature cycles, will be used. In this study, Bayerer\u2019s model (CIPS 2008 model) [33] is used, which is the most comprehensive analytical model. It includes the influence of the various parameters as temperature variation \u2206\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc57 , the minimum junction temperature \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b, the pulse duration \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b, the current per bond foot \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc35 , the voltage class \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc36 , and the diameter of the bond wire \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc4f . Table III summarizes the parameters of (17) used in this paper.\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc53 = \ud835\udc34. \u2206\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc57 \ud835\udefd1 . \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d ( \ud835\udefd2 \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc57,\ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b ) . \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udefd3 . \ud835\udc56\ud835\udc35 \ud835\udefd4 . \ud835\udc49\ud835\udc36 \ud835\udefd5 . \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc4f \ud835\udefd6 . (17)\nIt can be seen that the lifetime model in (17) requires information of junction temperature. The junction temperature of power semiconductor devices can be calculated by thermal models using calculated power loss. Thus, the junction temperature of power semiconductor devices in VSI is calculated using a Foster-type thermal network as\nimplemented in [34], as presented in Fig. 33. Here, \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc57 and \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc50 are the junction temperature and the case temperature, respectively. In this study, \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc50 is assumed to be 50 oC. Rth is the thermal resistance, whereas \u03c4 is the thermal time constant. The thermal network parameters of a three layers Foster-type network are shown in Table IV.\nFor lifetime estimation, a periodical mission profile is used with changing of the output power between 9kW to 3kW. Fig. 18 shows the calculated junction temperature and three-phase output currents following the change of output power in the mission profile. For comparison, the simulation is operated by conventional MPCC method and the proposed MPC scheme. In normal operation, the conventional MPCC method is employed to regulate the load current in accordance with the reference current, as shown in Fig. 34(a). A temperature variation \u2206\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc57 amplitude of 24 oC obtained by the conventional MPCC method is acquired. The proposed per-phase MPC method is employed with the assumption that phase \ud835\udc4e is the most aged leg in the second simulation. The effect of this proposed per-phase MPC method is the reduction of the temperature variation in phase \ud835\udc4e to 17.5oC at the same boundary conditions, as shown in Fig. 34(b). Using Bayerer\u2019s model (CIPS 2008 model) in (17), the number of cycles to failure of the established mission profile can be calculated. Table IV presents the estimated lifetime. As a result, the reduction of the temperature variation obtained by the proposed per-phase MPC method results in an increase in the estimated lifetime by four times in this investigation. It can be concluded that the proposed per-phase MPC method can effectively reduce thermal variation to increase the corresponding lifetime of VSI."

            "text": "A minimum loss per-phase method based predictive control is introduced to decrease the loss of specific phase legs and ease thermal stress in most aged power devices, resulting in the increase of converter lifetime. By injecting the predictive zero-sequence voltage, the modified predicted reference voltages generate a non-switching region in the desired phase leg, which results in reducing the switching frequency and switching loss. The proposed method is compared to the conventional MPC, concluding that it can reduce switching loss of particular phase leg and achieve quite the same THD for output current. With this method, the lifetime of the most aged phase leg will be extended by reducing the corresponding switching loss. Switching losses can be cut by up to 85% with the proposed technique. The consequent decrease in switching\nloss lowers the heat generated by switches, reducing thermal stress and lengthening the lifetime of VSI."
