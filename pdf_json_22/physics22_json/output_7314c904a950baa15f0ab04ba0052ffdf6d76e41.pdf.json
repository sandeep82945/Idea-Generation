    "abstractText": "Molecular dyes are finding more and more applications in photonics and quantum technologies, such as polaritonic optical microcavities, organic quantum batteries and single-photon emitters for quantum sensing and metrology. For all these applications, it is of crucial importance to characterize the dephasing mechanisms. In this work we use two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) to study the temperature dependent dephasing processes in the prototypical organic dye Lumogen-F orange. We model the 2DES maps using the Bloch equations for a two-level system and obtain a dephasing time T2 = 53 fs at room temperature, which increases to T2 = 94 fs at 86 K. Furthermore, spectral diffusion processes are observed and modeled by a combination of underdamped and overdamped Brownian oscillators. Our results provide useful design parameters for advanced optoelectronic and photonic devices incorporating dye molecules.",

            "text": "Organic dye molecules find a wide range of applications in optoelectronics and photonics, from active media in lasers [1], to fluorescent labels in confocal microscopy [2] and light emitters in displays [3]. Besides these technological applications, dye molecules are also of great interest for fundamental research studies. In recent years, single organic molecules have witnessed an increasing use in quantum technologies due to their favorable properties such as: small size, easy spectral tunability thanks to chemical design and synthesis, high photoluminescence quantum efficiency and high degree of coherence when cooled to low temperatures [4]. When placed inside an optical microcavity, upon strong coupling between excitonic and photonic modes, organic dyes have also been shown to form cavity polaritons [5,6], which are hybrid light\u2014matter quasi particles. The lifetime of such hybrid states is defined both by the rate at which photons \u2018leak\u2019 from the cavity, and by the rate at which light and matter mutually dephase. Thus, the choice of molecular materials having long dephasing times may allow for enhanced polariton lifetimes, thereby facilitating the build-up of polariton populations and the emergence of non-linear phenomena. For example, the recently demonstrated polariton condensation [7] and super-extensive light absorption important for the development of Dicke quantum battery [8]. In summary, both cavity polaritonics and the development of quantum technologies, in which information is imprinted on a single molecule in the form of an excitonic qubit, critically require the characterization of the dephasing processes in dye molecules. Organic dye molecules can be described with different models based on their complexity [9,10]; in this work, the dye under study can be approximated to the first order of as\nMolecules 2022, 27, 7095. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27207095 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2022, 27, 7095 2 of 13\na two-level system (TLS), with the energy of the transition from the ground (|1\u3009) state to the excited (|2\u3009) state, }\u03c921 = E2 \u2212 E1, falling in the visible range. Upon excitation of a TLS, a quantum coherent superposition of ground and excited states is created, described by the wave function |\u03c8\u3009= c1|1\u3009+c2 |2\u3009, with |c1|2 and |c2|2 the probability of finding the system in the ground and excited state, respectively. Interactions with the environment cause the decay of this superposition (decoherence processes), projecting the wave function on either the ground or the excited state. For a collection of TLSs, such as dye molecules in solution or in a film, the quantum state is more appropriately represented by the density operator \u03c1, with its off-diagonal elements \u03c121 = \u03c112\u2217 describing collective coherences and the diagonal terms \u03c111 and \u03c122 describing populations of the states [11]. In this case, dynamic interactions with the environment cause the decay of the macroscopic polarization, which can be phenomenologically described within the Bloch equation [11]. For an ensemble of TLSs all with the same transition energy }\u03c921, the absorption spectral profile is Lorentzian with linewidth inversely proportional to the dephasing time \u2206\u03c9 = 2/T2, and the system is said to be homogeneously broadened. Moreover, the TLS can have a distribution of transition energies \u2206\u03c921, often described by a Gaussian function, which, combined with dynamic perturbations, describes a situation known as inhomogeneous broadening. In this case, the absorption spectrum is the convolution between the Lorentzian linewidths of the individual transitions and the Gaussian distribution of their energies, resulting in the so-called Voigt profile. Several nonlinear spectroscopy techniques have been used to measure the dephasing time of molecular ensembles. In the frequency domain, spectral hole burning [12] consists of the use of an intense narrowband pump pulse to excite the molecules with transition frequencies close to the pump pulse frequency, thus saturating these transitions and burning a hole in the absorption spectrum. This is then detected by a broadband probe pulse), with spectral width corresponding to the homogeneous linewidth. The use of a narrowband pump pulse, however, unavoidably results in the loss of temporal resolution. In the time domain, non-collinear degenerate four-wave-mixing spectroscopies such as two- and threepulse photon echo (2PPE/3PPE) [13] enable dephasing times to be determined with the highest possible temporal resolution. In photon echo spectroscopies, a first pulse creates a polarization in the sample, and a second non-collinear pulse, delayed by the coherence time t1, interferes with this polarization, generating a population grating which diffracts either the second pulse itself (in 2PPE) or a third pulse delayed by the so-called population or waiting time t2 (in 3PPE), resulting in the emission of a third-order nonlinear signal E(3)(t1, t2, t3), where t3 is the detection time. In 2PPE/3PPE the diffracted signal is integrated in time, and its energy is measured as a function of the delay t1, with the signal decay time constant providing a direct measurement of the dephasing time. Often, when the decay time of the signal is comparable to or shorter than the duration of the excitation pulses, one uses the 3PPE peak shift approach [14], which consists of measuring the temporal delay between the maxima of the 3PPE signals emitted in different phase-matched directions. Two-dimensional electronic spectroscopy (2DES) [15,16] is an advanced version of 3PPE in which the third-order nonlinear signal emitted by the sample following excitation by the three pulses is fully measured in amplitude and phase by spectral interferometry with a fourth pulse, the local oscillator (LO), which is phase-locked to the third pulse. The nonlinear signal is usually spectrally resolved by a spectrometer that performs a Fourier transform (FT) with respect to the detection time t3, to obtain the detection energy axis }\u03c93. By performing an additional FT of the signal with respect to the coherence time t1, which requires interferometric stability of this delay as well, one obtains the excitation energy axis }\u03c91, with the final dataset corresponding to a 2D map correlating excitation (}\u03c91) and detection (}\u03c93) energies for a fixed value of the waiting time t2. Thanks to the FT approach, 2DES simultaneously combines very high temporal and spectral resolution. The diagonal peaks in the purely absorptive 2DES maps provide the most direct information on homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening and how they evolve in time, i.e., on spectral diffusion processes [17]. In the case of a collection of TLSs with different transition\nMolecules 2022, 27, 7095 3 of 13\nenergies (large inhomogeneous broadening limit) the 2DES peak will appear strongly elongated along the excitation axis, while for pure homogeneous broadening the peak will be symmetric. When the correlation between excitation and detection frequencies is lost, as in the case of spectral diffusion, the peak becomes progressively more symmetric. In this paper we exploit 2DES to study the dephasing processes in the prototypical small dye molecule Lumogen-F orange (LFO), which was recently shown to undergo superabsorption when embedded in a microcavity [8]. We study LFO in solution and embedded in a polymer matrix, and in the latter case we perform a temperature dependent study. We introduce a model that simultaneously fits the homogeneous and the inhomogeneous broadening and extracts the dephasing time from the absorptive 2DES maps. Finally, we use our model to describe the spectral diffusion dynamics at different temperatures and to reconstruct the steady-state absorption spectrum of the molecule."

This causes an increase in the linewidth along the anti-diagonal direction of the 2DES maps, and consequently a change of the line shape from elliptical to circular. To resolve the spectral diffusion, we define the Central Line Slope (CLS) [28\u201330] parameter, usually called \u03b2, an experimental value used to track the temporal evolution of the peak line shape.

Due to the proportionality between \u03b2(t2) and C(t2), we can search for the best model to fit the experimental data by finding a good expression for C(t2). Usually C(t2) is expressed by a series of exponential decays in which the amplitudes and the time decays are connected to the frequency fluctuation amplitude and the correlation time [11,30\u201332]. This model is usually adopted to study slope dynamics over picosecond timescales which are far from the temporal range considered in this analysis. The dynamics over ultrafast timescales are usually characterized by an ultrafast decay over a timescale comparable with the pulse duration and possibly with molecular vibrational periods. From the analysis of the oscillatory component of the TA data, reported in Figure S6, LFO molecules have a strong vibrational mode, peaked at 540 cm\u22121, coupled to the electronic transition, that could affect the dynamics of the temporal evolution of the slope. To model the FFCF we follow an approach implemented by Fecko et al. [33], that includes intermolecular vibrational modes described by a linear combination of underdamped and overdamped Brownian oscillators. The expression adopted in our data analysis includes: (i) an exponential decay with time constant \u03c4p comparable with the temporal resolution of the experiment; (ii) an oscillatory component describing the contribution of the vibrational mode; (iii) an offset term for the slow decay components longer than our temporal window. The final C(t2) function is written as follows:\nC(t2) = ae \u2212 t2\u03c4p + be\u2212 t2 \u03c4 ( cos \u03c9ct2 + ( 1\n\u03c4\u03c9c\n) sin \u03c9ct2 ) + c (2)\nwhere\u03c9c and \u03c4 are the frequency of the vibrational mode and its damping time, respectively, while the parameters a, b and c are the amplitudes related to the fast component, the vibrational mode and the long-lived exponential decay components, respectively. The last term c also includes inhomogeneous effects and hot ground state relaxation [33,34]. We fit the data by using Equation (2) as a model function with the frequency of the vibrational mode set to 540 cm\u22121. Figure 6c shows experimental values of \u03b2 for LFO at 86 K (blue dots) and 295 K (red dots) compared to our best fit (solid black line) obtained with the parameters reported in Table 2 (corresponding residuals are reported in Figure S9). The results confirm a good agreement between the model and the experimental data. The dynamics of the slope parameter \u03b2 at 295 K are consistent with those obtained for LFO diluted in DCM, with such a comparison reported in Figure S7.\nFinally, we exploit our model to reconstruct the static absorption spectrum of LFO corresponding to the 0-0 transition at room temperature. This is done using a Voigt profile function, where we used \u03b3 and \u03c3 as parameters for the Lorentzian (homogeneous) and Gaussian (inhomogeneous) linewidth, respectively. The calculated absorption spectrum of the first peak of the vibronic progression, centered at 2.34 eV, shows a good agreement with the experimental spectrum, as shown in Figure 6d."

In this geometry, the phase-matched nonlinear signal is emitted along the propagation direction of the probe, which therefore also serves as a phase-locked LO (self-heterodyned configuration). In the partially collinear geometry, both rephasing and non-rephasing signals are emitted along the probe direction, allowing the direct detection of purely absorptive spectra [37]. The experimental 2DES apparatus is described in detail in reference [38]. Briefly, pump and probe pulses are generated by a Non-collinear Optical Parametric Amplifier (NOPA) [39], and pumped by an amplified Ti:Sapphire laser (Coherent Libra, Santa Clara, CA, USA) that emits 100 fs laser pulses centered at 800 nm with a 1 kHz repetition rate. The NOPA produces broadband visible pulses with a spectrum spanning from 1.7 eV to 2.5 eV (green area in Figure 1), compressed down to sub-20-fs duration using chirped mirrors. A pair of phase-locked collinear pump pulses is generated by a common-path birefringent interferometer, the Translating-Wedges-Based Identical pulses encoding System (TWINS) [40], followed by a pair of chirped mirrors to recompress the pulses to nearly transform-limited duration. The coherence time t1 is controlled with interferometric precision by varying the insertion of the birefringent wedges in TWINS over a range from \u221230 to + 250 fs. The population time t2 is controlled by a mechanical delay stage with scan range of up to 400 ps. The data are processed as explained briefly in the following. A calibration procedure was applied to generate the excitation axis (h\u0304\u03c91) following techniques from [38]. Then the acquired data were apodised in the time domain by a Gaussian filter centered at time-zero and decaying to 30% of its amplitude at t1 = 50 fs to reduce the noise level. Finally, the data were Fourier transformed and phase-corrected in order to retrieve the 2DES map S (h\u0304\u03c91, t2, h\u0304\u03c93). Note that the width of the adopted filter does not affect the shape of the linewidth. The experiments were performed using a pump fluence of 50 \u00b5J/cm2 with parallel polarization between pump and probe pulses. The LFO thin films were measured at different temperatures, from 77 K to room temperature. Ultrafast TA measurements were also performed on the same apparatus by fixing t1 = 0 fs and are reported in the Supplementary Materials. We analyzed the temperature dependence of the 2DES line shapes to extract the information related to homogeneous and inhomogeneous spectral broadening and to obtain the temperature dependent dephasing time."

            "text": "Characterizing decoherence mechanisms in molecular dyes is important for their application in photonics and quantum technologies. Conventional spectroscopic techniques use multiple approaches to determine dephasing times and spectral diffusion processes [12,14,19,20,41,42]. Conversely, 2DES is an ideal tool for retrieving such information all together; it simultaneously differentiates the contributions from homogeneous and inhomogeneous broadening mechanisms by the shape of the diagonal peaks, while following the loss of excitation memory due to spectral diffusion, thanks to its combination of high temporal and spectral resolution. In this study we have performed 2DES of the prototypical molecular dye LFO embedded in a polymer under low aggregation conditions, which allows intermolecular interactions to be neglected. We accurately reproduced the experimental 2DES maps via a model using the Bloch equations for a two-level system. At 295 K we obtained a dephasing rate of \u03b3 = 12.4 meV, which corresponds to a dephasing time of T2 = 53 fs. A similar result is obtained for the molecule diluted in DCM (\u03b3 = 11.5 meV), and by applying an inhomogeneous limit model (\u03b3 = 12.7 meV). Temperature dependent 2DES measurements from 86 K to 295 K show a linear dependence of the dephasing rate on the temperature; at T = 86 K, the dephasing rate decreases to \u03b3 = 7 meV, with a dephasing time T2 = 94 fs, which is nearly doubled with respect to room temperature. Measurements as a function of the waiting time show a rapid loss of excitation memory on the 200 fs timescale due to spectral diffusion, with the CLS of the peaks modeled with underdamped and overdamped Brownian oscillators combined with an ultrafast decay. Overall, the results of our 2DES experiments in LFO are in good agreement with previous studies of dephasing processes in organic dyes. We believe that our results will provide useful parameters for the design of advanced optoelectronic and photonic devices (such as polaritonic cavities and organic quantum batteries) exploiting such molecules.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules27207095/s1, Figure S1: Static absorption and photoluminescence spectra of LFO films in polystyrene and polynorbornene; Figure S2: Transient absorption results of LFO in polystyrene (a), in solution (b) and in polynorbornene (c); Figure S3: 2DES of LFO diluted in DCM; Figure S4: Lineshape analysis results of LFO in Polystyrene obtained with inhomogeneous limit approach; Figure S5: Lineshape analysis results of LFO diluted in DCM; Figure S6: Transient absorption frequency analysis results for LFO/PS; Figure S7: CLS dynamics of LFO in polystyrene and diluted in DCM; Figure S8: Lineshape best fit residuals; Figure S9: CLS best fit residuals.\nAuthor Contributions: M.R., K.E.M. wrote the manuscript with the cooperation of M.M., T.V., D.G.L. and G.C.; Conceptualization, M.M., G.C., D.G.L. and T.V.; methodology, M.R., K.E.M.; software, M.R.; validation, M.M., T.V. and G.C.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, M.R., K.E.M., T.V.; writing\u2014review and editing, D.G.L., G.C. and M.M.; visualization, M.R.; supervision, T.V., G.C., D.G.L. and M.M.; project administration, D.G.L. and M.M.; funding acquisition, D.G.L. and M.M.
