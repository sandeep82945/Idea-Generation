Next, we recall the definition4 of a regular sequence; see Allouche and Shallit [1, 2] for characterisations, properties, and an abundance of examples. Asymptotic properties and further examples have been studied; cf. [5], [6], and the references therein.\n1We did not find any reference for that. If a reader is aware of such a reference, please contact the authors. Added in proof: a remark on the topic can be found in Dumas [4] after Definition 2. 2See https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/32921#issuecomment-1418154841. A smaller example is presented in Example 1.3. 3In other words, we extend the map M : A \u2192 KD\u00d7D to a monoid homomorphism from A\u22c6 to KD\u00d7D. By convention, if b is the empty word in A\u22c6, then M(b) is the D-dimensional identity matrix. If the dimension D equals 0, then the product of an empty vector, M(b) (for any b) and another empty vector is an empty double sum, so equals 0. 4Strictly speaking, this is an algorithmic characterisation of a regular sequence which is equivalent to the definition given by Allouche and Shallit [1], who first introduced this concept: they define a sequence y to be q-regular if the kernel\n{ y \u25e6 (n 7\u2192 qjn + r) \u2223 \u2223 j, r \u2208 N0 with 0 \u2264 r < q j }\nis contained in a finite dimensional vector space.\nDefinition 1.2. A sequence y \u2208 KN0 is said to be q-regular5 if there are a non-negative integer D, a family M = (M(a))a\u2208Aq of D \u00d7 D matrices over K, a vector u \u2208 K\n1\u00d7D and a vector-valued sequence v \u2208 (KD\u00d71)N0 such that for all n \u2208 N0, we have\ny(n) = uv(n),\nand such that for all r \u2208 Aq and all n \u2208 N0, we have\nv(qn + r) = M(r)v(n). (2)\nWe call (u, M, w) a linear representation of x and D the dimension of the linear representation of x.\nBy induction using (2), it is easily seen that for all n \u2208 N0, we have\ny(n) = uM(digitsq(n))w (3)\nwhere digitsq(n) = n0 . . . n\u2113\u22121 is the standard qary expansion of n, i. e., n = \u2211 0\u2264j<\u2113 njq j with n\u2113\u22121 6= 0, and w := v(0). In other words, given a q-regular sequence y with linear representation (u, M, w) and considering the recognisable series x with linear representation (u, M, w) over the alphabet Aq, we can write y = x \u25e6 digitsq.\nAs mentioned in Section 1.1, this is how the authors of this note implemented regular sequences in SageMath: these were a special case of recognisable series\u2014technically speaking, the class RegularSequence is a subclass of the class RecognizableSeries\u2014 where accessing the values for integer values is translated accordingly and additional properties (such as subsequences) are implemented. To construct a regular sequence in SageMath, the input is a family of square matrices M and two vectors u and w."

            "text": "Definitions 1.1 and 1.2 are worded in such a way as to allow several different linear representations of the same recognisable series or regular sequence. When working with such objects algorithmically, inevitably, the question of minimality of the dimension of the linear representation arises.\nAs mentioned in Section 1.1, Berstel and Reutenauer [3] describe an algorithm to determine a linear representation of minimal dimension for a recognisable series, given by some linear representation. The remarks at the end of Section 1.2 imply that this algorithm is also used in SageMath to find a linear representation of minimal dimension of a regular sequence. As also mentioned in Section 1.1, this led to a problem, and here is a simplified example illustrating it.\nExample 1.3. Let q = 2,\nu = ( 1 0 ) , M(0) =\n(\n1 1 0 0\n)\n, M(1) =\n(\n1 0 0 0\n)\n, and w =\n(\n0 1\n)\n, (4)\n5In the standard literature, the basis is frequently denoted by k instead of our q here.\nand consider the sequence y defined by (3) for these values of u, M , and w. We have y(0) = uw = 0 and for all positive integers n, the standard binary expansion digits 2 (n) ends on a 1, so writing digits 2 (n) = b1 for some b \u2208 {0, 1}\u22c6, we have\ny(n) = uM(b)M(1)w = ( 1 0 ) M(b)\n(\n1 0 0 0\n)(\n0 1\n)\n= ( 1 0 ) M(b)\n(\n0 0\n)\n= 0.\nHence, we have shown y(n) = 0 for all n \u2208 N0. For the zero sequence, the minimal linear representation is the representation of dimension 0, i. e., the left and right vectors as well as the matrices M(a) are empty and all matrix products, vector-matrix products, and matrix-vector products are empty sums and therefore 0, as required.\nWe now compare our result here with the one in SageMath.

Note that we used a recognisable series here because the algorithm by Berstel and Reutenauer is formulated for recognisable series.\nSo we do have a problem: we easily saw that our regular sequence y has a linear representation of dimension 0, but SageMath answered that all linear representations of the underlying recognisable series x have dimension at least 2.\nA few possibilities come to mind. Almost unthinkably, there could be an error in the algorithm of Berstel and Reutenauer, or, more probably, in our implementation of that algorithm in SageMath. Despite a clear peer-reviewing policy for contributions into SageMath, we might have overlooked something. We ask SageMath once more to get a partial answer.\nExample 1.4 (Continuation of Example 1.3). The input\nx\ngives the first few terms of the recognisable series as\n[0] + [00] + [10] + [000] + [010] + [100] + [110]\n+ [0000] + [0010] + [0100] + ...\nSo it seems that the recognisable series does not vanish. The output suggests that the recognisable series x with the linear representation defined in (4) is one exactly for those input words with trailing zeros. Indeed,\nx(b0) = uM(b)M(0)w = ( 1 0 ) M(b)\n(\n1 1 0 0\n)(\n0 1\n)\n= ( 1 0 ) M(b)\n(\n1 0\n)\n= 1\nby induction. This means that x(b) = 1 if 0 is a suffix of b and x(b) = 0 otherwise. It is therefore clear that there cannot be a linear representation of x of dimension 0 (because that would lead to all zeros due to empty sums). It is not hard to see that x cannot have a linear representation of dimension 1, either: then the matrices M(0) and M(1) of that linear representation would forcibly commute and x(b) could only depend on the number of occurrences of the letters 0 and 1 in b, but not on their position. Thus, independently of the algorithm of Berstel and Reutenauer (and its implementation in SageMath), we conclude that any linear representation of x must have dimension at least 2.\nSo with Examples 1.3 and 1.4, we did not construct a counter example to the validity of the minimisation algorithm of Berstel and Reutenauer for recognisable series, however in this particular example, we see that we cannot apply the algorithm to find a minimal representation of the regular sequence. More generally, this means that choosing an arbitrary family of matrices M and left and right vectors u and w, respectively, and defining a regular sequence by (3) can lead to situations where the algorithm of Berstel and Reutenauer for recognisable series does not return a minimal linear representation for the regular sequence.\nIs that the final word? Or can we somehow find at least some situations where using the minimisation algorithm for recognisable series is valid for the \u201ccorresponding\u201d regular sequence?"

            "text": "The short answer is, we need this note to discuss the questions raised by the example above. So, let us briefly come back to Example 1.3. A key feature was that at first we only inserted words with trailing one (or the empty word) into the recognisable series because standard binary expansions of positive integers have exactly this property. And indeed, as the discussion in the examples shows, inserting any other binary expansion (with trailing zeros) instead of the standard binary expansion would lead to another result. This seems to be an important distinction between recognisable series (all words allowed) and regular sequences (only words without trailing zeros inserted into the corresponding recognisable series).\nAt first glance, the following observation seems to be a technical detail: If we insert n = r = 0 into (2), we obtain v(0) = M(0)v(0). In other words, if not zero, then v(0) is\nan eigenvector of M(0) associated with the eigenvalue 1. It seems to be a minor detail because once we replace the formulation (2) by (3), it does not seem to be relevant any more. However, we note that this condition is not fulfilled in Example 1.3, as M(0)w = (\n1 0\n)\n6= w. So (u, M, w) as given by (4) is not a linear representation of the\n2-regular sequence y considered in Example 1.3 (and we carefully never claimed it to be one).6\nThis raises two questions. Suppose we have a regular sequence y, take a linear representation (u, M, w) of that regular sequence (thus implying M(0)w = w), take it as a linear representation of a recognisable series x, and then run the minimisation algorithm by Berstel and Reutenauer on it. Will this approach yield a minimal linear representation of y? And will that linear representation still fulfil the essential eigenvector property?\nThe answer to both questions is yes. But according to the saying \u201cfool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me\u201d, we should make sure to have a proof. The nature of SageMath as an open source software system also means that this proof should not be a \u201cwell-known fact in the community\u201d or some kind of an urban myth, but something which can be clearly referenced. In particular, such a reference is put in the documentation of SageMath. This note sets out to provide that proof and to clarify the relation between recognisable series and regular sequences, their linear representations, and their minimal linear representations."

A linear representation of a recognisable series x is said to be a minimal7 linear representation of x if its dimension is minimal over all linear representations of x.\nBerstel and Reutenauer present a characterisation for minimal linear representations [3, Proposition 2.1]. In this note we only need the direction of the following lemma and for reasons of self-containedness, we give an ad-hoc proof here.\nLemma 2.2 (Berstel\u2013Reutenauer [3, Proposition 2.1]). Let A be a finite set, x \u2208 KA \u22c6 be a recognisable series and (u, M, w) be a minimal linear representation of x of dimension D. Then span({uM(b) | b \u2208 A\u22c6}) = K1\u00d7D.\n6In order to construct a linear representation for a regular sequence out of a linear representation of a recognisable series as given by (4), one can follow the proof of [1, Lemma 4.1]. 7In [3], these linear representations are called reduced instead of minimal.\nThe basic idea of the proof is that if that span had lower dimension, then everything would take place in a proper subspace. Taking matrix representations with respect to a basis of the subspace would then give a lower dimensional linear representation.\nWe mention that by symmetry, we also have span({M(b)w | b \u2208 A\u22c6}) = KD\u00d71; but we will not need this property here.\nProof of Lemma 2.2. Let S := {uM(b) | b \u2208 A\u22c6}. Toward a contradiction, assume that we have span(S) = W for some proper subspace W of K1\u00d7D of dimension D\u2032 and let B be a basis of W . Let \u03a6B : K\n1\u00d7D\u2032 \u2192 W be the coordinate map with respect to the basis B.\nAs an implication of the definition of W , we have u \u2208 W , and so there exists a u\u2032 \u2208 K1\u00d7D \u2032 such that \u03a6B(u \u2032) = u. For all a \u2208 A, the map v 7\u2192 vM(a) is an endomorphism of W by construction of W : for b \u2208 A\u22c6, we have uM(b)M(a) = uM(ba) \u2208 S, which implies that the map under consideration maps S into itself and therefore maps W = span(S) into itself. We now construct a family M \u2032 = (M \u2032(a))a\u2208A of D\u2032 \u00d7 D\u2032 matrices over K as follows. For all a \u2208 A, let M \u2032(a) be the matrix representation of the endomorphism v 7\u2192 vM(a) of W with respect to the basis B, i. e., \u03a6B(v \u2032)M(a) = \u03a6B(v \u2032M \u2032(a)) holds for all v\u2032 \u2208 K1\u00d7D \u2032 . Let w\u2032 \u2208 KD \u2032\u00d71 be the matrix representation of the homomorphism v 7\u2192 vw from W to K with respect to the basis B of W and the standard basis of K, i. e., \u03a6B(v \u2032)w = v\u2032w\u2032 holds for all v\u2032 \u2208 K1\u00d7D \u2032\n. For all b \u2208 A\u22c6, this implies that\nx(b) = uM(b)w = \u03a6B(u \u2032)M(b)w = \u03a6B(u \u2032M \u2032(b))w = u\u2032M \u2032(b)w\u2032.\nIn other words, (u\u2032, M \u2032, w\u2032) is a linear representation of x, and its dimension is D\u2032 < D, a contradiction to (u, M, w) being a minimal linear representation of x.\nLet us consider a linear representation (u, M, w) of a recognisable series x \u2208 KA \u22c6\n, A a finite set. If there is a z \u2208 A with M(z)w = w, then it is clear that x(bz) = x(b) holds for all b \u2208 A\u22c6. It turns out that the converse is true if the linear representation is minimal. This is the assertion of the following proposition.\nProposition 2.3. Let A be a finite set, x \u2208 KA \u22c6\nbe a recognisable series and (u, M, w) be a minimal linear representation of x. Let z \u2208 A be such that x(bz) = x(b) holds for all b \u2208 A\u22c6. Then we have M(z)w = w.\nProof. Let D be the dimension of the linear representation (u, M, w), and set S := {uM(b) | b \u2208 A\u22c6}. As\nuM(b)w = x(b) = x(bz) = uM(bz)w = uM(b)M(z)w\nholds for all b \u2208 A\u22c6, the linear maps v 7\u2192 vw and v 7\u2192 vM(z)w from K1\u00d7D to K coincide on S. As S generates K1\u00d7D by Lemma 2.2, these maps also coincide on K1\u00d7D = span(S). Therefore, their matrix representations w and M(z)w coincide.\nDefinition 2.4. Let x \u2208 KA \u22c6 q be a recognisable series such that x(b0) = x(b) holds for all b \u2208 A\u22c6q. Then x is said to be compatible with regular sequences (or simply compatible).\nRemark 2.5. Let x be a recognisable series with minimal linear representation (u, M, w). Then by Proposition 2.3, x being compatible is equivalent to the condition M(0)w = w.\nThe following example shows, however, that non-minimal linear representations (u, M, w) of a compatible recognisable series do not necessarily satisfy the property M(0)w = w.\nExample 2.6. Consider the constant recognisable series x \u2208 C{0,1} \u22c6\nwith x(b) = 1 for all b \u2208 {0, 1}\u22c6. It is clear that x is compatible and a minimal linear representation (u, M, w) is given by\nu = (1) \u2208 C1\u00d71, M(0) = M(1) = (1) \u2208 C1\u00d71 and w = (1) \u2208 C1\u00d71.\nSo M(0)w = w holds, as stated in Remark 2.5. Moreover, (u\u2032, M \u2032, w\u2032) with\nu\u2032 = ( 1 0 ) , M \u2032(0) = M \u2032(1) =\n(\n1 0 0 2\n)\nand w\u2032 =\n(\n1 1\n)\nis also a linear representation of x: for a word b \u2208 {0, 1}\u22c6 of length \u2113, we have\nu\u2032M \u2032(b)w\u2032 = ( 1 0 )\n(\n1 0 0 2\n)\u2113 (\n1 1\n)\n= ( 1 0 )\n(\n1 0 0 2\u2113\n)(\n1 1\n)\n= ( 1 0 )\n(\n1 2\u2113\n)\n= 1 = x(b);\nthe lower right entry in M \u2032(b) is annihilated by the zero in u\u2032. However, M \u2032(0)w\u2032 = w\u2032 does not hold. This is no contradiction to Remark 2.5 because (u\u2032, M \u2032, w\u2032) is not minimal."

(5)\nFurthermore, we have M(0)w = w.\nIn the following lemma, for b = a0 . . . a\u2113\u22121 \u2208 A \u22c6 q, we set\nvalue(b) := \u2113\u22121 \u2211\nj=0\najq j,\nwith the usual convention that if b is the empty word in A\u22c6q, then value(b) = 0.\nLemma 3.3. Let y \u2208 KN0 be a q-regular sequence and (u, M, w) a linear representation of y. Then\ny(value(b)) = uM(b)w\nholds for all b \u2208 A\u22c6q. In particular, the value of uM(b)w is independent of the particular choice of the linear representation (u, M, w) of y and of trailing zeros of b.\nProof. Let b \u2208 A\u22c6q and write b = c0 \u2113 for some c \u2208 A\u22c6q and some \u2113 \u2208 N0 such that \u2113 is maximal. Then value(b) = value(c), and by (5), we have\ny(value(c)) = uM(c)w.\nAs M(0)w = w by Lemma 3.2, we also have\nuM(b)w = uM(c)M(0)\u2113w = uM(c)w,\nas required.\nDefinition 3.4. Let y \u2208 KN0 be a q-regular sequence with linear representation (u, M, w). Then the recognisable series x \u2208 KA \u22c6\nwith linear representation (u, M, w) is called the recognisable series associated to y.\nRemark 3.5. From Lemma 3.3 we see that the recognisable series associated to a q-regular sequence is well defined. From Lemma 3.2 we see that a recognisable series associated to a q-regular sequence is compatible. Moreover, we see that every linear representation of a q-regular sequence is also a linear representation of its associated recognisable series.\nTheorem 3.6. Let y be a q-regular sequence and (u, M, w) be a minimal linear representation of the recognisable series associated to y. Then (u, M, w) is a linear representation of y, and it is also minimal.\nIn other words, to find a minimal linear representation of a regular sequence, we can use the minimisation algorithm presented by Berstel and Reutenauer [3, Chapter 2] on the associated recognisable series, i. e., the recognisable series with the same linear representation as the regular sequence.\nProof of Theorem 3.6. Let x denote the recognisable series associated to y and D denote the dimension of (u, M, w). By Remark 3.5, x is compatible, and therefore, by Proposition 2.3 (see Remark 2.5), we have M(0)w = w.\nWe define a vector-valued sequence v \u2208 (KD\u00d71)N0 by v(0) := w and (2) for all n \u2208 N0 and r \u2208 Aq. Note that M(0)w = w implies the validity of (2) for n = 0 and r = 0.\nBy the above definition of v and Lemma 3.3, (u, M, w) is indeed a linear representation of y.\nNow, any linear representation of the q-regular sequence y of dimension D\u2032 is also a linear representation of the recognisable series x by Remark 3.5. Therefore, due to minimality of (u, M, w), we have D\u2032 \u2265 D. In particular, by choosing a minimal linear representation of y, we see that (u, M, w) is a minimal linear representation of y as well.\nAt last, we can relax the assumptions of Theorem 3.6 and ask: Given a q-regular sequence with minimal linear representation, can we find a recognisable series that gives the same values for each standard qary expansion of a non-negative integer, but whose minimal linear representation has a smaller dimension than that of the regular sequence? The following example provides an affirmative answer.\nExample 3.7. Let us consider the recognisable series x \u2208 C{0,1} \u22c6 with x(b) = 2t and t counting the letter 0 in b \u2208 {0, 1}\u22c6. Note that x(b0) = 2x(b) 6= x(b) for all b \u2208 {0, 1}\u22c6; in particular, x is not compatible. Moreover, a minimal linear representation (u, M, w) of x is given by\nu = (1) \u2208 C1\u00d71, M(0) = (2) \u2208 C1\u00d71, M(1) = (1) \u2208 C1\u00d71 and w = (1) \u2208 C1\u00d71.\nIn contrast, let y \u2208 CN0 be the 2-regular sequence with y(n) = x(digits2(n)) for all n \u2208 N0. Then (u \u2032, M \u2032, w\u2032) with\nu\u2032 = ( 1 0 ) , M \u2032(0) =\n(\n2 \u22121 0 1\n)\n, M \u2032(1) =\n(\n1 0 0 0\n)\nand w\u2032 =\n(\n1 1\n)\nis a minimal linear representation of y. Therefore, starting with the 2-regular sequence y whose minimal representation has dimension 2 can lead to a minimal representation of dimension 1 of a recognisable series when ignoring trailing zeros."
