    "abstractText": "Plasmonic MXenes are of particular interest, because of their unique electron and phonon structures and multiple surface plasmon effects, which are different from traditional plasmonic materials. However, to date, how electronic energy damp to lattice vibrations (phonons) in MXenes has not been unraveled. Here, we employed ultrafast broadband impulsive vibrational spectroscopy to identify the energy damping channels in MXenes (Ti3C2Tx and Mo2CTx). Distinctive from the well-known damping pathways, our results demonstrate a different energy damping channel, in which the Ti3C2Tx plasmonic electron energy transfers to coherent phonons by nonthermal electron mediation after Landau damping, without involving electron-electron scattering. Moreover, electrons are observed to strongly couple with A1g mode (~60 fs, 85\u2013100%) and weakly couple with Eg mode (1\u20132 ps, 0\u201315%). Our results provide new insight into the electron-phonon interaction in MXenes, which allows the design of materials enabling efficient manipulation of electron transport and energy conversion.",

However, to date, how electronic energy damp to lattice vibrations (phonons) in MXenes has not been unraveled. Here, we employed ultrafast broadband impulsive vibrational spectroscopy to identify the energy damping channels in MXenes (Ti3C2Tx and Mo2CTx). Distinctive from the well-known damping pathways, our results demonstrate a different energy damping channel, in which the Ti3C2Tx plasmonic electron energy transfers to coherent phonons by nonthermal electron mediation after Landau damping, without involving electron-electron scattering. Moreover, electrons are observed to strongly couple with A1g mode (~60 fs, 85\u2013100%) and weakly couple with Eg mode (1\u20132 ps, 0\u201315%). Our results provide new insight into the electron-phonon interaction in MXenes, which allows the design of materials enabling efficient manipulation of electron transport and energy conversion.\nThe knowledge of the interplay between electron and lattice vibration (phonon) is essential for a thorough understanding of energy transport and conversion pathways from electron to phonons in materials1\u20133, and it is indispensable for developing rational guiding theories for advanced 2D materials. After decades of development, versatile and valuable applications have been developed by manipulating nonequilibrium interactions between collective free electron oscillations (surface plasmon, SP) and phonons in typical plasmonic metal nanostructures4\u20136. To date, the well-known energy conversion pathway in noble metal nanostructures is that the photon-induced SP decays to generate nonthermal electrons after Landau damping, the nonthermal electrons then evolve into thermal electrons through the electron-electron scattering within hundreds of femtoseconds, and finally, thermal electrons relax within a few picoseconds to vibrational modes via the electron-phonon coupling (Fig. 1 channel I)7\u20139. Another energy damping pathway has been revealed in the 2D material graphene, where photo-induced plasmons directly convert into intrinsic optical phonons within 20 fs (Fig. 1 channel II)10. Different from noble metal nanomaterials and semi-metallic 2D graphene, the 2D plasmonic transition metal carbide materials (MXenes) have broadband electronic absorptions and intricate vibrational modes11\u201313, offering more channels for light manipulation. The ultrafast electron diffraction experiment reported the excited lattice vibration within ~230 fs for Ti3C2Tx, indicating the strong electron-phonon coupling 14. The time scale observed in their work is close to the electron-electron scattering process (~100 fs)8, suggesting the partial electrons damp without experiencing the electron-electron scattering. In other words, the unique structures of MXenes may provide competing energy\nReceived: 27 May 2022\nAccepted: 13 December 2022\nCheck for updates\n1State Key Laboratory ofMolecular Reaction Dynamics andDalian Coherent Light Source, Dalian Institute of Chemical Physics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, 457 Zhongshan Road, Dalian 116023, P.R.

However, recent experimental results using the time-resolved terahertz techniques showed the weak electron-phonon coupling in the MXene15. These interesting observations reported in the previous works prompt us to reinvestigate both the phonon and electron dynamics and to unravel the different energy transfer channel.\nIn this work, we use the broadband impulsive vibrational spectroscopy (IVS)16\u201318 and the transient absorption spectroscopy to interrogate phonon and electron dynamics simultaneously, which could unravel the entangled pathways from the electron damping to coherent lattice vibration in two typical plasmonic MXenes (Ti3C2Tx and Mo2CTx). Two distinctive coherent vibration responses are observed for the two 2D materials with the SP and IBT (inter-band transient) excitation. For Ti3C2Tx, the SP and IBT electrons show similar vibrational responses. Furthermore, by controlling the optical parameters of the pumppulses (wavelength and fluence), our study reveals a different energy transfer pathway (Fig. 1 channel III) from the SP damping to the nonthermal electrons, followed by the nonthermal electrons directly strong coupling with the A1g mode within ~60 fs and weak coupling with the Eg mode during 1\u20132 ps under the SP excitation. Meanwhile, the excited IBT nonthermal electron also could directly couple with the A1g mode without the electron-electron scattering. In contrast, the resonant andnonresonant SP excitations inMo2CTx show different vibrational dynamical responses, which suggests a direct SPphonon coupling under the SP excitation. The energy pathway is determined by electron-phonon coupling time and electronic density of states near the Fermi surface."

            "text": "Phonon and electron dynamics in ultrafast spectroscopy As illustrated in Fig. 2a, once a certain ultrafast photon is injected into a material by the pump light, it leads to deformation of the electronic cloud in the material. This photoinduced potential energy change drives atomic displacement19\u201322. In other words, light-induced\nelectronic excitation in 2D materials could couple with internal vibrational modes (phonons). This interplay thus appears in the transient spectra as the time-dependent oscillation. In this work, we sought to reveal the damping pathways of the SPs in two MXenes, Ti3C2Tx and Mo2CTx (Characterizations are given in Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). The absorption spectrum of Ti3C2Tx (red line in Fig. 2b) shows an SP resonance at ~780nm,whileMo2CTx (green line Fig. 2b) presents an SP absorption state at ~532 nm. If the energy of the excited electrons flows to a certain lattice vibration mode, coherent oscillations of the lattice vibration should be observed. Therefore, the dynamic process of the electron relaxation would display a combination of decay and oscillation, as shown in Fig. 2c. Interestingly, due to the different electronic states generated by the pumping pulse, the distinctly coherent coupling between these electronic states and the lattice vibrations can be observed via the broadband detection, as shown in the inset of Fig. 2c. The electronic and vibrational damped signals (Fig. 2d) can be numerically separated by the multiexponential and oscillation fitting16,23,24. The frequencies of coherent lattice vibrationmodes canbe obtained by fast Fourier transform (FFT) of the oscillation curve (Fig. 2e). Therefore, we could determine a scenario for the energy flow from a stimulated SP to the specific atomic motions by exploring the interplay between electron and coherent phonon (CP) vibration dynamics with ultrashort laser pumping. Compared with the previous studies of MXenes13\u201315,25,26, the IVS could capture phonon and electron dynamics information simultaneously.\nThe observations of phonon and electron dynamics To determine the time-resolved coherent vibrational distribution of Ti3C2Txwithdifferent electronic excitation states,we selected topump the SP state at 780 nmand the IBT state at 532 nm.Detailed analyses of the probe-dependent electron/phonon dynamics and phase shifts are presented in Supplementary Figs. 3\u20135 and Supplementary Note 1. Apparently, one CP state was detected in the wavelength regions (i) and (ii) shown in Fig. 2c, while two CP states existed in the wavelength region (iii). The electron dynamics (Supplementary Fig. 6) and the phonon response (Fig. 3a, b) could thus be revealedwith the twopump pulses. The formation and decay time constants of electrons and\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:7900 2\nphonons are obtained by fitting with formulas (1) & (2) (See Materials and Methods data analysis). Noticeably, the CP dynamics in Fig. 3a, b (with the IBT and SP excitation, respectively) show similar formation (67 \u00b1 20/55 \u00b1 20 fs) and decay (820 \u00b1 60/680\u00b1 42 fs) time constants. The similarity suggests the SP decay to generate IBT electrons, followed by the electron coupling to CP, rather than the SP direct coupling toCP. This is reasonable because the screening of nucleus by free electrons usually prevents thedirectplasmon-phonon couplings27. The Ti3C2Tx with metallic electronic structure has a lot of free electrons near the Fermi surface. Thus, the SP mainly interacts with the free electrons near the Fermi surface, which effectively screens the direct interaction between the SP and the phonon.\nTo identify whether the electron-phonon coupling occurs after the electron-electron scattering, we determined the electron-electron scattering half-time to be ~50 fs (the details of acquiring the half-time are described in Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8 and Supplementary Note 2), and performed the pump fluence-dependent experiments to obtain the electron and CP dynamics. Figure 3c, d display that the electron relaxation slows down gradually with increasing the pump fluence. Such phenomenon is similar to that observed in typical noble metals, which has been attributed to the electron temperature elevation (i.e., electron thermalization) induced by the electron-electron scattering28\u201330. However, the formation time and the phase of CP (Fig. 3c, d and Supplementary Figs. 9 and 10; marked lines showing no obvious phase shift in CP) are independent with the pump fluence, indicating that the CP stems from the nonthermal electrons rather than the thermal electrons. This interpretation is confirmed by a control experiment employing the sample of gold nanorods (GNRs), in which the dynamic process is unambiguously assigned to the channel I (Fig. 1). The oscillating dynamic traces of GNRs (see Supplementary\nFig. 11) exhibit the obvious phase shift and the CP dynamics variation with increasing the pump fluence (see Supplementary Note 3). On the other hand, the linear fit of the pump fluence-dependent electronphonon coupling time constants gives the intercepts29,31, as shown in the inset panels of Fig. 2c, d. The intercept values (57 \u00b1 10 and 39 \u00b1 10 fs under pumping at 532 and 780 nm respectively) represent the\nelectron-phonon coupling time constant without the thermal electron generation process in Ti3C2Tx. These time constants are consistent with the above-mentioned formation timeconstants ofCP (67 \u00b1 20and 55 \u00b1 20 fs), which further verifies that the CP originates from the nonthermal electrons. It is also noted that the electron-phonon coupling time constants are close to the electron-electron scattering time constants (~50 fs), suggesting that the two physical processes occur simultaneously. Based on the time constants, almost half of the nonthermal electrons directly couple with the CP. In summary, the experimental observations demonstrate a distinct energy transfer pathway (Fig. 1 channel III), i.e., the SP damps to nonthermal electrons, and a significant portion of them directly couple with the CP without experiencing the electron-electron scattering.\nThe time-resolved vibrational spectra of Ti3C2Tx show only one mode at 200 cm\u22121 by pumping at 532 nm (Fig. 3e). However, the plasmonic excitation at 780 nm generates a strong vibrational mode at ~200 cm\u22121 and a weak one at ~128 cm\u22121 (Fig. 3f). The FFT results of each 0.5 ps interval (Supplementary Fig. 12) show that the mode at ~128 cm\u22121 appears during 1.0\u20131.5 ps. The fitting result in Fig. 3a shows that the coherent oscillation exclusively comes from the ~200 cm\u22121 vibrational mode for the pump pulse at 532 nm. In contrast, for the pump excitation at 780 nm, the ~128 cm\u22121 vibrational mode contributes to ~15% population of the coherent oscillation, and the ~200 cm\u22121 vibrational mode still has a major contribution. These two vibrational modes are consistent with the Raman spectra shown in Fig. 3g, h, which are assigned as an out-of-plane (A1g, ~200 cm\u22121) and an in-plane (Eg, ~128 cm\u22121) vibrations of titanium atoms in the outer layer (Ti1/Ti2) as well as those of carbon and surface groups32\u201334. There is no observable frequency shift of the vibrational modes in Raman and IVS experiments, which may be due to the limitation of the time resolution (~40 fs) in our experimental system. It is noted that the signal of the Eg mode in IVS (Fig. 3f and Supplementary\nFig. 12) is very weak, differing from the strong signal of Eg in the Raman spectrum (Fig. 3h). This is probably because the Raman spectra can only detect zone-center optical phonons35.

The near-infrared absorption spectrum of Ti3C2Tx has been displayed in Supplementary Fig. 13. The summary results with excitations at UV (380 nm) and near-infrared (1300 and 1580 nm) wavelength regions are shown in Fig. 3i, j and Supplementary Fig. 14. The Eg vibrational mode is not active after excitation at 380 nm, although the band at 380 nm has the same absorbance as that at 780 nm in Ti3C2Tx (Fig. 2b). Then, we tuned the pump wavelength to match the longitudinal SP bands (1300 and\n1580nm)11. The results (Fig. 3i) show a weak Eg vibration peak at 128 cm\u22121. The relative population (<8%) of the excited Eg mode is still lower than the population (~15%) observed with pumping at 780nm. The vibration response of Ti3C2Tx as a function of the pumping wavelength is summarized in Fig. 3j, which clearly demonstrates that the electron strongly couples with the A1g mode and fairly weakly couples with the Eg mode.\nIn contrast, the electron and phonon dynamics in Mo2CTx (Supplementary Fig. 15 and Note 4) show that the time-resolved oscillatory signals (Supplementary Fig. 15a) are different following excitation at 532 and 700nm.

Then, the CP loses its approximately half population within 230 fs, and the remaining population decays slowly within 2 ps. For the nonresonant excitation (700nm), theCP shows a formation timeof 163 \u00b1 30 fs and a relaxation time of 870 \u00b1 50 fs. The time-partitioned FFT spectra of Mo2CTx (Supplementary Fig. 15b) display two modes (~150 and ~300 cm\u22121) under the resonant excitation and one mode (~300 cm\u22121) under the nonresonant excitation. This reveals the selective interaction between electrons and phonons in MXenes.\nOrbital-dependent electron structure and phonon dispersions band Togain insight into the pumpwavelength-dependent electron-phonon coupling, we calculated the electron structure and density of state (DOS) of Ti3C2O2 (Fig. 4a). We marked with a gray bar around \u22121.3 eV (0.0 eV, 1.6 eV, 2.6 eV) and named a (b, c, d) band. The c band (around 1.6 eV) is contributedmainly by the dxy, dxz, and dz2 orbitals of Ti1/Ti2 contribute. The d band is contributedmainly by the dz2 orbitals of Ti1/ Ti2. Figure 4b shows fat bands of dxy, dxz, and dz2 of Ti (The diameters of the circles represent the intensity of DOS). Figure 4c shows the phonon dispersions band and DOS. Comparing calculations (Fig. 4a) and experiments after excitation at 380 nm (_\u03c9pump = 3.3 eV) and 532nm (_\u03c9pump = 2.3 eV) shows that the a-c and the b-d transition occur at the M point and electrons can be excited to Ti dz2 orbital. In contrast, for the pump at 780 nm (_\u03c9pump = 1.6 eV), the b-c transition\noccurs at M and \u0393 points, and electrons can be excited to dxy, dxz, and dz2 orbital. According to orbital-dependent fatband electron structure (Fig. 4b), the DOS is relatively lower in dxy orbital in the c band at M and \u0393 point than in dz2 and dxz orbitals, suggesting the transitions of electrons from the ground state into dz2 and dxz orbitals are twomain routes after excitation at 780 nm. Besides, the calculated results (Fig. 4c) show that theDOSof theA1gmode at ~200 cm\u22121 ismuchhigher than the DOS of the Eg mode at ~128 cm\u22121."

            "text": "Our results revealed the characteristics of the photon energy conversion pathway for the plasmonic MXenes by tuning the pump laser wavelength and fluence, and by changing the metal elements of materials. In the following, we discuss the symmetry-dependent electron-phonon coupling and the damping SP channels.\nFirstly, the electron-phonon interactions are dependent on the spatial symmetry of atom displacement and electronic cloud deformation by the optical field. The symmetry match between electronic orbitals and vibrational mode is crucial for electron-phonon coupling. As shown in Fig. 5a, the movement along the z-direction of dz2 orbital couldmodulate the electronic cloud to strengthen the coupling of the out-of-plane vibration mode (such as A1g mode) but has no effect on the coupling of the in-plane vibrationalmode (such as Eg mode). While the movements along the x- and z-direction of dxz orbital can couple with the in-plane and the out-of-plane vibrational modes. For the\nFig. 4 | The calculated band structures and density of states (DOS) of Ti3C2Tx (Ti3C2O2). aHybrid functional electron structures andDOS.Marked around \u22121.3 eV as the a band, around \u22120.3 eV as the b band, and about 1.6 eV as the c band (main contribution of Ti1/Ti2 dz2, dxz, dxy orbitals), ~2.6 eV as the d band (main contribution of Ti1/Ti2 dz2 orbital).bHybrid functional fatband ofdxy, dxz and dz2 of Ti\n(The diameters of the circles represent the intensity of DOS).

Under the 532 or 380 nm pump, electrons are excited mainly into the dz2 orbital, leading to strongly couplingwithA1g andbarely couplingwith Eg. Furthermore, a highDOS of a phononmode is a key factor for the electron-phonon coupling, as it ensures sufficient quantities of phonons interplay with electrons. Figure 4c shows that the DOS of the A1g mode at ~200 cm\u22121 is much higher than the DOS of the Eg mode at ~128 cm\u22121, indicating the electronprefers to couplewith theA1gmode. Theparallel dynamics studies of Mo2CTx and calculation (Supplementary Figs. 15\u201316, and Note 4) show that the electron-phonon coupling alsoobeys the symmetry rule. Furthermore, the fast CP response (Supplementary Fig. 15a) inMo2CTx suggests a direct SP-CP interaction under the SP excitation. Compared with themetallic Ti3C2Tx, the electron density near the Fermi surface is low in semi-metallic Mo2CTx\n12,36. Thus, free electrons are not sufficient to screen the direct SP-CP interaction. It is obvious that the electron density near the Fermi surface is a crucial factor in modulating the relaxation channel of SP.\nSecondly, the electron-phonon coupling is related to the electron density of states near the Fermi surface and the matching between electron and phonon energy levels37,38. Metallic MXenes have higher densities of electronic states near the Fermi surface. The plasmon band (on the order of 104cm\u22121) is three or four orders of magnitude larger than the phononmodes (on the order of 100\u2212101 cm\u22121)7,8 in typicalmetal\nplasmonic materials. This large energy gap requires that the plasmonic energy engages in several sequential physical processes, such as Landau damping, electron-electron scattering, and electron-phonon coupling. In contrast, the plasmonic band and the high-frequency phonons in graphene are both located in the mid-infrared region (on the order of 104 cm\u22121)10,39. Unlike Au nanostructures and graphene, MXenes (Ti3C2Tx and Mo2CTx) present plasmonic modes with frequencies ranging from the visible to mid-infrared (103\u2212104cm\u22121)8 regions and high phonon frequencies (102\u2212103 cm\u22121)11,32,34. Thus, the plasmons band frequencies are larger than thephononsbyoneor twoorders ofmagnitude. Thegap of frequency between plasmon and phonon is significantly smaller in MXenes than in metal nanostructures and is slightly larger than in graphene. Better energy level matching also should enhance electronphonon coupling.\nThirdly, electron-phonon coupling was affected by material components. MXenes have variousmetal elements as well as ionic and polar structures. Ti and Mo metal elements mainly contribute to the presence of electronic states near the Fermi level for the two MXenes. The electron-phonon interactions time constants in metals are inversely proportional to atomic mass (metal atomic masses: Ti<Mo<Au)40,41. Our results show that the electron-CP coupling strengths of Ti3C2Tx (electron-phonon coupling time constant: ~50 fs) and Mo2CTx (electron-phonon coupling time constant: ~152 fs, Supplementary Fig. 15c) are stronger than that of the plasmonic Au nanostructure (electron-phonon coupling time constant: 1\u20132 ps)28,42.\nFig. 5 | Energy transfer pathways. a The symmetry-dependent electron-phonon coupling: for route 1, the electron is excited into dz2 orbit, then it couples with A1g mode; for route 2, the electron is excited into dxz orbit, then it coupleswithA1g and Eg modes. The Shadings of purple ball indicate the directions of atomic vibration. b The energy transfer channels from photon to phonon. The \u03c4e-ph is the time constant of the electron-phonon coupling and the \u03c4e-e is the time constant of the electron-electron scattering. For a SPmaterial after absorbing photons to excite the SP, in a case of a strong screening effect of the nucleus by high free electrons\ndensity near the Fermi surface, the SP decays generate the nonthermal electron. These generated nonthermal electron could interact directly with A1g mode if the \u03c4e-ph is close to or less than the \u03c4e-e, in which the energy of the thermal electron will dissipate to acoustic phonons. If the \u03c4e-ph ismuch greater than the \u03c4e-e, the energy of nonthermal electron would damp to all kinds of phonons mediated by the thermal electron. In case of a weak screening effect (insufficient screening), the SP decays could couple directly with phonon.\nNature Communications | (2022) 13:7900 6\nThese fast coupling time constants inMXenes suggest strong electronphonon interactions. Considering the ionic and the polar structure of MXenes, the electron-phonon interactions generally originate from the deformation potential and the Fr\u00f6hlich mechanism43. The two electron-phonon coupling mechanisms usually dominated in polar semiconductive 2D materials such as halide perovskites2,24,44, singleMoSe2 45 and typical MoS2 46,47. Transverse optical phonon mode (TO) mainly infers to the short-range deformation potential induced electron-phonon coupling48. The longitudinal optical phonon mode (LO) can generate long-range macroscopic electric fields, which leads to long-range Fr\u00f6hlich interaction induced electron-phonon coupling49. The previous study using terahertz spectroscopy15 suggested theweak long-range electron-LO couplingwhereas the ultrafast electron diffraction experiment14 purposed the strong electronphonon coupling without clarifying the energy transfer pathway and the coupled phonon modes, which has been clearly presented in this work. In metals, only short-range electron-phonon interactions are effective since the free electrons in the conduction band could screen the long-range electric potential of the displaced nuclei50, indicating that the strong electron-TO coupling is allowed but the electron-LO coupling is weak in Ti3C2Tx. Furthermore, we determined the electronphonon coupling constant (\u03bb) in the framework ofmetals40. The values of \u03bb are 1.62 \u00b1 0.33 for A1g and 0.054 \u00b10.018 for Eg in Ti3C2Tx from the measured electron and CP dynamics. The details of obtaining \u03bb can be found in the Supplementary Note 5. Compared with the values (\u03bb ~ 0.03\u20131.45) ofmostmetals and semi-metals, such asAu,Cu, Ti, V, Nb,W, Pb41 and Ag, Al, TiAl37 and graphene51, the electron-phonon coupling constant in Ti3C2Tx indicates a strong electron-A1g phonon coupling and a weak electron\u2013Eg phonon coupling. Additionally, the significant frequency-shift of the A1g mode has not been observed in Ti3C2Tx in our experiment, which is similar to the single-layer MoSe2 of strong electron-A\u20321 phonon coupling45 and theNiPS3 of the strong electron-A1g phonon coupling52. Therefore, the metallic electron structure and the polar lattice mode in MXenes play key roles in electron-phonon interactions. Based on the discussions, the general energy migration pathways are epitomized in Fig. 5b.\nIn summary, simultaneous capturing phonon and electron dynamics allows us to reveal the pathways from photon energy to phonon in MXenes. A distinct energy transfer pathway (The SP decay generates nonthermal electrons, followed by nonthermal directly strong coupling to the A1g mode in Ti3C2Tx) is identified, which is distinct from the typical damping pathways in the traditional SP materials. Furthermore, the energy pathways about excited electrons canbemodulated by electron-phonon coupling and electronic density of states near the Fermi surface. Themechanism of the energy transfer and the symmetry-dependent electron-phonon coupling allows scientists to utilize photon energy efficiently, and it is also vital for developing new insights into different plasmon physics and subsequent developments and industrial applications related to new photothermal therapy, chemical reaction, and optoelectronic devices."
