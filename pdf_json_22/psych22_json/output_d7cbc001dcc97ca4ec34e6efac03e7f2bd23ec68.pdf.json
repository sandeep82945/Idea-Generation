Hennings1,2, Marcus Ising1, Manfred Uhr1, Florian Holsboer1,3 and Susanne Lucae1*\n1Translational Department, Max Planck Institute of Psychiatry, Munich, Germany, 2Department of Dialectical Behavioral Therapy, kbo-Isar-Amper-Klinikum Munich-East, Munich, Germany, 3HMNC Brain Health GmbH, Munich, Germany\nMore than 700,000 peopleworldwide die by suicide every year, and the number of suicide attempts is estimated as 20 times higher, most of them being associated with psychiatric disorders, especially major depression. Knowledge about e ective methods for preventing suicide attempts in individuals at high risk for suicide is still scarce. Dysregulation of the neuroendocrine stress response system, i.e., the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis, is one of the most consistent neurobiological findings in both major depression and suicidality. While the HPA axis is mostly overactive in depression, individuals with a history of suicide attempts exhibit an attenuated hormonal response to stress. It is unknown, however, whether the HPA axis is constantly attenuated in repeated suicide attempters or whether it regains normal responsivity after recovery from depression. Using the combined dexamethasone suppression/corticotropin-releasing hormone (dex/CRH) test, we assessed HPA axis regulation in acute depression (N = 237) and after recovery with respect to previous suicide attempts. Patients without previous suicide attempts show normalization of the stress hormone response to the second dex/CRH (basal ACTH response and cortisol response) after recovery from acute depression, while patients with multiple previous SA show an increased ACTH response. The change in HPA axis responsivity in patients with only one previous SA lies between the response patterns of the other groups with no change in HPA axis reactivity. Our findings suggest that patients with a history of suicide attempts belong to a subgroup of individuals that exhibit a distinct pattern of stress hormone response during acute depression and after recovery. Future studies may extend our approach by investigating additional psychological stress tasks to gain a broader understanding of the stress pathology of recurrent suicide attempters.\nKEYWORDS\nsuicidality, depression, DEX/CRH (dexamethasone/corticotropin releasing hormone) test, HPA, suicide attempt\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 01 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "While patients repeatedly engaging in suicidal behavior often feel left unsupported, healthcare professionals struggle themselves in order to address their needs (1, 2) and do not know how to prevent suicide attempts efficaciously in the future (3). More than 700,000 people worldwide die by suicide every year, and the number of suicide attempts (SA) is estimated as 20 times higher (4). Across psychiatric disorders, risk factors for suicidal behavior such as childhood maltreatment, non-suicidal self-injury, and previous SA have been identified (5, 6) but the predictive ability has not improved over the years, according to a recent meta-analysis (7).\nUp to 70% of suicides have been linked to affective disorders (8), which in turn are associated with dysfunctional stress coping and, in particular, dysregulation of the neuroendocrine stress response system, i.e., the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (HPA) axis (9). Dysregulation of the HPA axis turned out to be one of the most predictive biomarker-associated suicide risks (10, 11). Interestingly, while overactivity of the HPA axis is a common finding, especially in severe depression (12), an attenuated stress hormone response has been observed in individuals with suicidal behavior (13\u2013 17). It is unclear how these findings fit together with HPA axis hyperactivity documented in severely depressed patients with high suicidality. Hypercortisolism predicted suicide and suicidal behavior in major depression in some studies using the dexamethasone-suppression test (DST) (10, 18, 19). With respect to its sensitivity and specificity, however, the DST has been questioned (20). Further and conflictingly, more recent studies using a psychological stress paradigm showed an attenuated cortisol response in patients with a history of suicide attempts or with an increased risk for suicide (14, 16). With respect to these controversial findings, the combined dexamethasone suppression/corticotropin-releasing hormone stimulation (dex/CRH) test may provide some advantages for the assessment of the HPA axis in suicidality as it (1) has been recommended for the assessment of the HPA axis in affective disorders due to higher sensitivity and specificity (20, 21)\nAbbreviations: ACTH, adrenocorticotropic hormone; AAUC, ACTH AUC; AUC, area under the concentration curve; BMI; body mass\nindex; CAUC , cortisol AUC; CRH, corticotropin-releasing hormone; dex/CRH test, combined dexamethasone suppression/corticotropin-\nreleasing hormone test; GR, glucocorticoid receptor; HAM-D, 21-item\nHamilton depression rating scale; HPA axis, hypothalamus-pituitary-\nadrenocortical axis; MAOI, monoamine oxidase inhibitor; MARS,\nMunich Antidepressant Response Signature; MDE, major depressive\nepisode; NaSSA, noradrenergic, specific serotonergic antidepressant;\nOR, odds ratio; SD, standard deviation; SNRI, serotonergic-noradrenergic\nreuptake inhibitor; SSRI, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor; TCA,\ntricyclic antidepressant.\nand (2) comprises, besides the DST, a direct CRH stimulation component that would presumably be more comparable to the stress paradigms applied in more recent studies.\nThe stress-diathesis model of suicidality (22, 23) indicates multiple factors, such as psychopathology, genetics, early life experiences, social interactions and stress, physical illness, and neurobiology, to determine one\u2019s predisposition to suicidal behavior. From a psychological point of view and according to the interpersonal theory of suicide (24), suicide risk is mainly driven by the feeling of being a burden on others, thwarted belongingness, and a learned ability to hurt oneself, on the one hand. On the other hand, suicidal behavior can be regarded as an acquired dysfunctional technique of problem-solving (25), and subjects that experienced inescapable situations in youth may have \u201clearned\u201d to react with suicidal behavior, including suicidal thoughts as a possible emotional escape from an otherwise unescapable situation. In fact, in patients with a history of SA, it has been observed, that ideating, preparing, or attempting suicide under conditions that are perceived as highly aversive (such as despair or guilt in affective disorders) may give hope for an escape from the condition and reduce mental pain (25\u201327). This clinical observation has been substantiated by functional neuroimaging studies showing altered activity and connectivity of specific brain regions in suicide attempters (28, 29) and during suicide ideation (30), including regions that are functionally connected to the HPA axis such as the pre-frontal cortex [reviewed in (28)]. Remarkably and counterintuitively at a first glance with respect to HPA axis overactivity observed in severe depression (9), previous studies showed that the HPA axis of patients ideating or having attempted suicide responds with an attenuated stress hormone response upon a stress paradigm (14\u201316), suggesting that these individuals belong to a subgroup with distinct HPA reactivity to mental stress. Interestingly in this regard, an attenuating effect of previous SA on the HPA axis can be found also during acute depression (31), and this effect increases with the number of previous SA.\nReduced basal cortisol in patients with a previous SA has been interpreted as a \u2018burnt-out\u2019 HPA axis after a long period of chronic stress in the fore-front of the suicide attempt (32) and blunted stress hormone response has been coined a marker of suicide risk (14, 15). Nevertheless, the function and pathophysiology of an attenuated HPA axis associated with suicidality are not yet understood. It is further unknownwhether the attenuation of the HPA axis is transient, indicating a distinct hormonal response to mental stress (such as the calming effect of suicidality in some individuals), or whether it is a sustained effect in terms of a vulnerability marker. We, therefore, assessed the HPA axis response with the combined Dex/CRH test during a state of mental stress, i.e., an (at least moderately severe) acute depressive episode, and a second time after recovery (N = 237) hypothesizing that previous suicide attempts may impact on the normalization of HPA axis reactivity.\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 02 frontiersin.org"

Although there were no significant differences in basal or hormonal response levels between groups at admission, patients with recurrent and without previous SA showed an opposing dynamic with respect to HPA axis reactivity in the combined dex/CRH test during recovery from depression. While patients without previous suicide attempts show a reduction in stress hormone response in the dex/CRH (Abas, AAUC, and CAUC; when excluding recent SA also for Cbas) between admission and discharge, patients withmultiple previous SA show an increase in stimulated ACTH (AAUC). The HPA axis reactivity of patients with only one previous SA did not change, and thus, ranges between the other two groups.\nThese findings are remarkable in several aspects: First, hyperactivity of the HPA axis is a common finding in acutely\ndepressed patients (9), and normalization of the hormonal excess chaperons successful antidepressant treatment (33, 37). Thus, at a first look, it is hard to explain why some patients (i.e., multiple suicide attempters), although not different in depression severity and ability to recover compared to others (i.e., patients without previous suicide attempts), show an increase in HPA axis reactivity during recovery. Nonnormalization of the HPA axis (here in terms of reduction in hyperactivity) after antidepressant treatment has been associated with early relapse of depression (38\u201340) and increased suicide risk (10). As previous SA is a risk factor for both (18, 19, 41, 42), an increase in HPA reactivity in previous suicide attempters at discharge as observed in this study may explain some of these earlier findings. Thus, non-normalization or an increase in the HPA axis during depression treatment may be a biological characteristic for individuals with a history of SA.\nSecond, it is still unclear whether HPA axis reactivity is only acutely altered in suicide attempters or resembles a stable\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 06 frontiersin.org\nvulnerability marker. In a prospective study, attenuated stress hormone response after a psychosocial stress task predicted later SA (13). The reduced cortisol response to stress has also been found in the offspring of parents with a history of SA (15) or completed suicide (14), indicating that sustained or phasic hypocortisolism preceded a suicide attempt, and hair cortisol was reduced in suicide attempters (43). In addition, several studies showed reduced baseline cortisol in patients with SI or a previous SA (16, 44, 45). Plausibly, hyporeactivity of the HPA axis was regarded as a risk marker of SA, indicating impaired activation of the HPA axis in response to stress. Nevertheless, in a previous analysis, we could not replicate a negative correlation of HPA response with previous SA at hospital admission after recovery from depression at discharge, arguing against the hypothesis of an attenuated HPA axis as a trait marker (31). There are no further studies using repeated HPA assessment during a depressive episode with respect to previous SA. Thus, the increase in stimulated ACTH in patients with multiple SA after recovery in this study may be the expression of a certain \u201cnormalization\u201d or regained reactivity of the HPA axis in these patients.\nThird, our findings may add to the understanding of the HPA axis in suicidality. It has been speculated that cortisol non-suppression in the dexamethasone suppression test (DST) as observed in former studies is (1) either associated with completed suicides or (2) primarily associated with nonresponse to antidepressant treatment and only secondary to increased suicide risk (11, 42). In a large depression sample, recent suicide attempters showed a reduced HPA response in the dex/CRH test (17), and previous suicide attempts were negatively correlated with CRH-induced ACTH and cortisol levels independent of depression severity (31). While not reaching significance, we observed a similar direction of effect in this study at the admission dex/CRH test. In addition, several studies using psychological test tasks in individuals with previous suicide attempts show consistently a hyporeactive HPA axis compared to controls (14\u201316). Thus, taking all these observations together, antecedents of previous SA and recent SA attenuate HPA reactivity, an effect that can also be observed during acute depression (in comparison to patients without previous SA). Although being still reactive, HPA activity seems to be inverted in the latter: in situations of mental stress (including major depression), previous suicide attempters exhibit an attenuation of the HPA axis (14\u201317). O\u2019Connor and co-workers (16), for example, showed that participants who had made a previous suicide attempt exhibited a significantly lower cortisol response to a multidimensional stress test compared to suicide ideators and controls. Interestingly, in their study, subjects who attempted within the past year showed a blunted cortisol response compared to subjects with a more distant history of SA. Adding the observation of an increased stress hormone response after recovery from\ndepression made in this study, it can be speculated that the attenuation of the HPA axis during mental stress in these particular subjects may be transient. Further studies, including repeated assessments of the HPA axis, are needed to prove this hypothesis.\nNevertheless, the meaning of an altered HPA axis in SA remains still obscure and interpretations of the findings can only be vague. While the increase of ACTH in patients with multiple SA observed here argues against the hypothesis of a \u201cburned-out,\u201d blunted HPA axis due to repeated stress (32), the assumption of a psychologically calming effect of SA and SI has been repeatedly documented in individuals engaging in suicidal behavior (25, 26, 46). The latter has led to the hypothesis of reinforced suicidality as ideating or attempting suicide can opt a way out of situations that are experienced as unbearable, and though suicidality can become a learned behavior, causing relief from mental pain (25, 47). Thus, a transient attenuation of stress hormones appears plausible from this point of view, and alterations of the HPA axis in recurrent SA may be a biological marker of this mechanism.\nWhile cortisol measurements during a psychological stress task let speculations about the level of regulation widely open, higher cerebral instances of stress hormone regulation are bypassed in the dex/CRH test by the direct administration of CRH. Thus, alterations in stress hormone regulation in previous suicide attempters might be downstream to the hypothalamus. Interestingly, in this context, epigenetic mechanisms have been implicated in HPA axis hypoactivity in SA-mediated, possibly via GR downregulation and enhanced GR sensitivity (43). Sustained stress transmitted by a depressive episode, in contrast, translates into cortisol receptor resistance (9), an effect that may have superimposed the independent impact of suicidality on cortisol in our study.\nThe results of our study still need to be interpreted cautiously due to the high variability of hormonal levels and inhomogeneous group sizes. Furthermore, given a small sample size in the group of patients with multiple SA, power may have been insufficient to detect significant effects. In a previous analysis, we found small effects of nicotine consumption on ACTH but not cortisol, whereas caffeine intake, BMI, and the number of attempts to place the venous catheter did not influence ACTH or cortisol response in the dex/CRH test (12). Nevertheless, compared to basal hormonal measurements or the DST, the dex/CRH test is advantageous with respect to sensitivity and robustness (21), and patients receiving carbamazepine or lithium were excluded from analysis due to their known psychopathology-independent influence on the HPA axis (12, 48). Sex-specific analyses revealed that the effect of decreasing stress hormones (Abas and AAUC; data not shown) in patients without previous SA is mainly produced by men, while the hormonal increase during recovery occurs in\nFrontiers in Psychiatry 07 frontiersin.org\nwomen with multiple SA (AAUC and CAUC; data not shown). While gender has a well-known impact on the HPA axis, the observed differences may also be related to a female majority in the group of patients with multiple SA. Notwithstanding, this is the first observation of an inverted dynamic of HPA axis reactivity during acute and recovery of depression with respect to previous SA that needs replication in independent samples. To further elucidate the pathophysiology of different forms of mental stress in individuals with a history of SA, it would be appropriate to apply psychological stress tasks in addition to the dex/CRH test during acute depression and after recovery. The direct comparisons of HPA axis reactivity in the dex/CRH test with psychological stress tasks may allow further insights into the anatomical and molecular level of altered HPA axis regulation."
