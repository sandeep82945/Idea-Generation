Psychologists found that children in New Zealand had developed a preference for thinner or \u2018average-sized\u2019 bodies even before they turned three years old1. And this preference doesn\u2019t change as they get older, say Tyrol and other scientists who identify as fat. Many say that weight-based teasing and bullying were a part of their daily lives from primary school onwards.\nThe effects of weight bias can be even worse in adults. More than 80% of Americans have a body mass index (BMI) that is above 25 (defined as \u2018overweight\u2019 by the US National Institutes of Health) and more than 50% have a"

Despite this, weight discrimination is rampant throughout US society: in one study, nearly 60% of adults reported experiencing stigma as a result of their body size2.\nThis isn\u2019t just a US phenomenon, either. Average BMIs in many parts of the world have increased over the past few decades. What has also changed in the United States and a handful of other nations, including Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdom, is greater recognition that weight bias is a problem, and many are taking nascent steps to address it.\nTo Robert Rosencrans, an MD\u2013PhD student studying neuroendocrinology at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, the problem begins with the language used to discuss the issue. It\u2019s commonly referred to as the obesity epidemic, yet, Rosencrans says, the issue doesn\u2019t meet the true definition of an epidemic. He doesn\u2019t deny that average body weights around the world have risen, but \u201cthere\u2019s never been exponential growth in the number of people with a BMI over some arbitrary cut-off point\u201d, Rosencrans says. Yet calling it an epidemic frames larger people as inherently diseased and a menace, he says.\nThe way in which public-health interventions address obesity is also problematic. Many prescribe education to help people lose weight, teaching them how to select lower-calorie items from menus or to bake dishes instead of frying them. Tyrol says that this framework probably explains why so many of her friends tend to view fat people as being somehow not bright enough to maintain a lower BMI.\n\u201cIt\u2019s not thoughtful or kind to suggest that you can tell from someone\u2019s body composition what they know,\u201d she says.\nAdding to the problem is the misperception that everyone can control their weight. By this flawed logic, if someone is larger, it must be because they eat too much and exercise too little. By extension, then, many assume that losing weight should simply be a matter of eating less and exercising more. Mads Tang-Christensen is familiar with this line of thinking. Before leaving his role as scientific vice-president at Novo Nordisk in Copenhagen last month, he had spent several decades working in obesity research to understand the neurobiology of appetite regulation. And as someone diagnosed with obesity, he\u2019s all too aware that he, like many overweight individuals, can follow medical directions to the letter and yet remain heavy.\nTang-Christensen says he\u2019s never personally experienced weight stigma while at work, where his colleagues are on the cutting edge of obesity research. Studies are uncovering the complicated nature of appetite (how hungry or satiated someone feels) and metabolism (how the body uses the food that has been eaten). Interactions between these two processes help\nto control body size3 \u2014 and so it is much more complex than just balancing \u2018calories in\u2019 with \u2018calories out\u2019.\n\u201cI\u2019ve been living with obesity my whole life,\u201d he says. \u201cIt gives me some legitimacy when I talk to a crowd\u201d about the company\u2019s research.\nEven a wealth of research demonstrating the genetic and environmental factors that influence body size hasn\u2019t stopped weight bias in the workplace. People who are overweight are often viewed as lacking willpower4 and less employable5 than their thinner counterparts. As a result, they are less likely than slimmer colleagues to be called back for an interview, to be offered a position and to be paid similarly6. All of this hampers people\u2019s ability to advance in their careers.\nAnother study found that negative stereotypes about fatness made workplace training less effective for larger individuals7. The bias persists at management levels, too \u2014 researchers have shown that a larger waist circumference in business executives was associated with negative reviews of leadership skills and personality traits8. Weight discrimination is also inextricably linked to a person\u2019s gender. One study found that women were 16 times more likely than men to experience weight-based discrimination at work9. (Although gender is neither binary nor fixed, the study tracked only these two identities.)\nAcademia is no exception when it comes to workplace weight stigma, yet the bias rarely factors in promotion discussions. For example, although the American Sociology Association has argued that relying on student evaluations of teaching for decisions about tenure is discriminatory when it comes to race, ethnicity, sex and gender, weight does not get a mention. Because overweight individuals don\u2019t fit the stereotype of what a professor looks like10, weight bias might affect students\u2019 evaluation scores of their teachers.\nWeight bias takes a toll The impacts of implicit bias on factors such as hiring, firing, tenure, promotion and salary decisions are well documented. However, other, more subtle, practices make science less welcoming to fat people.\nPaus\u00e9 recounted a subtle but pervasive undertone of bias at morning tea breaks, when thinner colleagues would discuss wanting to lose weight in her presence, and referenced being \u201cnaughty\u201d if they ate cake, and so on. Paus\u00e9 sensed the message to her was clear: \u2018We don\u2019t want to look like you, and we will jump through an infinite number of hoops to keep that from happening\u2019. Feeling unwelcome, Paus\u00e9 stopped attending. Missing out on such informal networking opportunities can have a ripple effect throughout a scientist\u2019s career, because they lose out on building bonds with co-workers and hearing about\nActions by colleagues can make people of all sizes feel included.\nCreating a workplace that is accepting of all body sizes is straightforward, says Robert Rosencrans, a neuroendocrinology MD\u2013PhD student at the University of Alabama at Birmingham \u2014 by bucking the narrative around weight, health and morality. He makes a point never to compliment weight loss or comment on another person\u2019s body. He also refuses to pass judgement on food choices or eating habits. As a result, he\u2019s managed to decrease the amount of talk about food and bodies in his environment \u2014 a change that also benefits those with food sensitivities and eating disorders.\nOther aspects include changes to the physical environment. The more a person weighs, the more strain their joints are under, Rosencrans says, which mean knees and ankles can tire quickly. Padded or gel-filled floor mats can help, and increase comfort for anyone standing for hours at a fume hood or laboratory bench. Rosencrans says that some of his colleagues hesitate to ask for such accommodations because they fear that people in the department \u2014 and even their principal investigator \u2014 will blame them for their fatness. They often think it\u2019s easier to suffer in silence, he says.\nGroup leaders should ensure that lab ergonomic designs suit all body shapes and sizes by asking members what furniture they would like. Provide chairs that can support larger bodies and that don\u2019t have arm rests, and leave space around tables and chairs so that everyone can navigate with ease and not feel cramped.\nSimilarly, provide personal protective equipment and field clothing that fits larger bodies. In a Facebook group for ecologists, one frequent question is where to find plussize field gear. Although plus-size fashion has improved in the past two decades, options such as cargo trousers, waders and jackets for women over a US size 14\u201316 (European size 44\u201346) remain hard to find. Theo (Chelsea) Newbold, a plant pathology PhD student at Pennsylvania State University in University Park, says that otherwise, the entire process of sourcing larger-sized lab wear sends the clear message that \u201cyou aren\u2019t welcome here\u201d."

As a result, she said, \u201cThe number of us that actually make it all the way through to finish our PhDs and become scientists is quite small.\u201d\nNot all weight bias is subtle. In 2013, a Twitterstorm erupted when Geoffrey Miller, a psychologist at the University of New Mexico in Albuquerque, tweeted that if obese people didn\u2019t have the willpower to give up carbohydrates, they would never have the willpower to finish their PhD dissertation. Paus\u00e9 was infuriated, but not surprised.\n\u201cIt was a lovely overt demonstration of the stigma that people face in [academia],\u201d she said. \u201cWhile he was the one saying it out loud, he wasn\u2019t saying something that\u2019s very different from what most people think.\u201d Miller, who apologized and deleted the tweet, was formally censured by the university.\nWeight stigma from health-care providers can also affect scientists\u2019 working lives. As a bioethicist at the University of Texas in Houston, Keisha Ray spends her professional life addressing how racial biases influence the health of Black Americans. Although her career gives her a unique insight into these biases, Ray says that she and her colleagues experience an added stigma: because they work in health care and science, they \u2018shouldn\u2019t\u2019 be fat because they \u2018know better\u2019. When she consulted her physician in 2019 about an unexplained weight gain of more than 6 kilograms, the doctor suspected that it was due to poor eating habits \u2014 despite Ray\u2019s assertions to the contrary.\n\u201cI\u2019ve had to work harder to be an advocate for my own care as a patient because I am fat and Black and a woman,\u201d she says.\nThe physician\u2019s response only compounded Ray\u2019s distress about her weight gain and made it hard for her to focus. All she could think about, Ray says, was what she might have done wrong. The stress from ongoing weight bias can have a multitude of physical and\npsychological effects, including increases in the stress hormone cortisol, metabolic problems such as diabetes, physical mobility issues and depression and anxiety11.\nSuch discrimination against and hatred of fatness creates a self-fulfilling prophecy for larger-bodied individuals seeking higher education and job promotion, Ray says. With so few role models, people of size begin to think that achievements such as a PhD or an executive position are out of reach. This lack of diversity then implies to their thinner counterparts that, in fact, larger individuals really don\u2019t have what it takes, says Ray. To help counter this narrative, Paus\u00e9 started a Tumblr blog in 2013 called Fuck Yeah! Fat PhDs. The blog includes more than 150 photos of PhD candidates or holders who identify as fat. Paus\u00e9 said that such a resource, filled with\nrole models for aspiring scholars, provides pushback against the idea that a person can be successful only once they lose weight."

As a Black woman, Ray\u2019s experiences are different from those of Tang-Christensen, who is a white man, and from those of Newbold, who identifies as non-binary and queer. Ray also points out that she has a certain amount of financial and educational privilege that helps to shield her from some of the weight bias experienced by others.\nAs a young computer programmer, Tyrol had come straight from her undergraduate studies to work at a small, private company. She soon realized that the professional world showed a distinct preference for bodies that conformed to various social rules: they had light skin, they were thin (but not too thin), they styled their hair a certain way and wore the \u2018right\u2019 clothes. Tyrol didn\u2019t fit in with those norms \u2014 and didn\u2019t feel that she should.\n\u201cIf I had been a male programmer, I don\u2019t think my weight would have mattered at all,\u201d Tyrol says. But, she says, as an overweight woman, she had the impression that her colleagues didn\u2019t value her presence, and the experience was one factor that ultimately led her to pursue a PhD. \u201cThere was no one fat in my part of the tech world except for me.\u201d\nWhen other identity-based biases combine with the public\u2019s fat-shaming attitudes, it can make overweight scientists feel like outsiders. But, researchers of size say, colleagues can do small things to act as allies and be inclusive of larger peers, such as adjusting the work environment or avoiding making personal remarks. To Tyrol, just hiring more people of size isn\u2019t enough. Even seemingly innocuous comments by colleagues about \u2018naughty\u2019 dessert-eating or well-meaning encouragements to exercise allow weight bias to persist.\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going to fix the problems of representation in our country is people looking deep and hard inside themselves and seeing what they are doing that\u2019s perpetuating sizeism,\u201d she says.\nCarrie Arnold is a freelance writer based near Richmond, Virginia.\n1.
