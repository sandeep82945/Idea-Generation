Systems include 86 confirmed lensed quasars and a further 17 likely lensed quasars based on imaging and/or similar spectra. We also confirm 11 projected quasar pairs and 11 physical quasar pairs, while 25 systems are left as unclassified quasar pairs \u2013 pairs of quasars at the same redshift, which could be either distinct quasars or potential lensed quasars. Especially interesting objects include 8 quadruply imaged quasars of which two have BAL sources, an apparent triple, and a doubly lensed LoBaL quasar. The source redshifts and image separations of these new lenses range between 0.65\u20133.59 and 0.78\u20136.23\u2032\u2032respectively. We compare the known population of lensed quasars to an updated mock catalogue at image separations between 1 and 4 arcseconds, showing a very good match at z < 1.5. At z > 1.5, only 47% of the predicted number are known, with 56% of these missing lenses at image separations below 1.5\u2032\u2032. The missing higher-redshift, small-separation systems will have fainter lensing galaxies, and are partially explained by the unclassified quasar pairs and likely lenses presented in this work, which require deeper imaging. Of the 11 new reported projected quasar pairs, 5 have impact parameters below 10 kpc, almost tripling the number of such systems, which can probe the innermost regions of quasar host galaxies through absorption studies. We also report four new lensed galaxies discovered through our searches, with source redshifts ranging from 0.62 to 2.79.",

Their variable sources allow measurements of the time delays between images, which can be used to constrain the Hubble constant through time-delay cosmography (Shajib et al. 2020; Harvey 2020). The compact nature of the source allows a probe of the mass at compact scales in the lensing galaxy through\n\u2605 E-mail: cameron.lemon@epfl.ch \u2020 NHFP Einstein Fellow\nmicrolensing; the brightness variations caused by stars as they pass in front of each quasar image can be used to constrain the Initial Mass Function (Jim\u00e9nez-Vicente &Mediavilla 2019; Schechter et al. 2014) and place limits on the abundance of primordial black holes (Mediavilla et al. 2017). Simultaneously, microlensing can constrain the innermost structure of quasars at high-redshift (Hutsem\u00e9kers & Sluse 2021; Paic et al. 2022). The particular brightness of quasar sources provides an excellent tool for studying the geometry and kinematics of intervening matter (Rubin et al. 2018; Okoshi et al. 2021; Lemon et al. 2022). This brightness also means that lensed quasars are often source-selected (Myers et al. 2003; Oguri\n\u00a9 2022 The Authors\nar X\niv :2\n20 6.\n07 71\n4v 1\n[ as\ntr o-\nph .G\net al. 2006), in contrast with lensed galaxy samples which are selected through their bright lensing galaxies. This offers a chance to create a well-defined statistical sample down to small separations, which can be used to probe cosmology and galaxy evolution parameters (Chae 2003; Oguri et al. 2012). These studies are often limited by the small number of lenses that suit their particular purpose, for example requiring four well-separated images with time delays above 10 days for time-delay cosmography.\nRecent optical to near-infrared surveys now provide an efficient way to select high-confidence quasar candidates across the whole sky (e.g. Stern et al. 2012), and have the resolution and depth to identify whether such systems are lensed, i.e. whether there are multiple images and a lensing galaxy present (e.g. Chan et al. 2022). However, lensed quasars are particularly rare, and outnumbered by convincing contaminant systems, mainly composed of compact star-forming galaxies and chance quasar/star projections (Treu et al. 2018). The all-sky space-based catalogues fromGaia offer a particularly effective way of removing these contaminants. In the previous papers of this series, we have shown that combining the Gaia catalogue detections and parameters with WISE and ground-based optical imaging can efficiently remove the common contaminants of lensed quasar searches (Lemon et al. 2017, 2018, 2019). In this paper, we continue our spectroscopic follow-up campaign of lensed quasar candidates selected with the techniques developed in these papers.\nIn Section 2, we describe the selection techniques and datasets used for candidate selection. Follow-up spectroscopy and imaging are described in Section 3. Section 4 details the characteristics of individual systems, and a general discussion on the samples and sub-samples are discussed in Section 5. We conclude in Section 6."

            "text": "Candidates were selected following Lemon et al. (2019), and represent the follow-up of different Right Ascension and Declination ranges, as well as untargeted systems in previously covered sky, due to lack of spectroscopic follow-up time. Two searches begin from a catalogue of quasars and quasar candidates. For these searches we used the Milliquas catalogue (Flesch 2015), which consists of confirmed quasars and highly likely quasar candidates based on X-ray, radio, and optical and infrared colour selection. We supplement this catalogue with objects using colours from the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE). We take objects with W1\u2013W2 > 0.4 (in Vega), which is less strict than most quasar selections in order to include systems with possibly large contamination from the lensing galaxy, or sources with non-standard quasar colours. Our final search begins from a morphological galaxy catalogue. Below, we briefly describe the selection techniques for lensed quasars within these quasar and galaxy samples, making use of Gaia data release 2 (GDR2, Gaia Collaboration et al. 2018). Further details on selection numbers and completeness of recovering existing samples can be found in Lemon et al. (2019).\n2.1 Multiple Gaia detections around quasar catalogues\nThis search is refined from that originally performed in Lemon et al. (2018), namely searching for multiple Gaia detections around red ALLWISE detections (Mainzer et al. 2011). The search consists of visually inspecting ground-based colour images of systems satisfying varying W1\u2013W2 colour cuts, local stellar densities and thresholds on the significance of proper motion for the different\nnumbers ofGaia detections associated to the system. The Milliquas catalogue is also used as a starting catalogue for this selection."

            "heading": "2.2 Modelling unWISE pixels",
            "text": "The main contaminants of the search detailed above are quasar+star projections, since they will have multiple Gaia detections, often lacking the necessary proper motion precision to remove the star as a moving object, and having quasar-like colours in the infrared, radio, or X-ray due to blending issues in WISE (PSF FWHM of \u223c5\u2032\u2032). Ground-based imaging can often rule out such pairs through optical colour differences or a lack of a lensing galaxy, however contaminants still remain and the number of objects is too large to visually inspect. Lemon et al. (2019) introduced a forced model fitting of WISE data based on Gaia positions to extract the infrared colours of nearby point sources and thus classify the multiple components within such systems. We used the unWISE W1 and W2 data (Lang et al. 2016), an unblurred coaddition of all WISE data to-date. Following local Gaia density cuts, proper motion significance cuts, and finally cuts in the G\u2013W1 vs. W1\u2013W2 colour space, we obtained a classification procedure to retain nearly 99 per cent of known lensed quasars, while removing \u223c80 per cent of previously followed-up contaminants.\n2.3 Gaia detections offset from LRGs\nSince both search techniques presented above rely heavily on source selection, we also investigate using galaxies as a starting catalogue. We use spectroscopic galaxies from SDSS DR12, and keep all systems with oneGaia detection within 1 and 3.5\u2032\u2032, or twoGaia detections within 4.5\u2032\u2032(and separated by less than 4.5\u2032\u2032). The need for the single detection to be further than 1\u2032\u2032is based on known lensed quasars satisfying such a constraint, and reduces contamination. We also use morphological galaxies from Pan-STARRS, requiring at least one Gaia detection between 1 and 3\u2032\u2032 away. Proper motion and astrometric excess noise cuts are performed on all matching Gaia detections to further remove contamination from stars and star-forming galaxies."

In particular, the following steps are taken:\n\u2022 After bias-subtracting each image, cosmic rays are found and masked as all pixels above a certain threshold in the absolute Laplacian of the data. For the brightest objects this value is increased depending upon visual inspection of the cosmic ray mask.\n\u2022 The sky background is subtracted by determining the median value within the pixels either side of the trace of the object (between 20 and 80 pixels away).We later use this same background to correct thewavelength calibration to bright sky lines. The region is also used to determine the sky background noise at each spectral pixel (i.e., wavelength).\n\u2022 A Poisson noise map is created using the detector gain, and added in quadrature with the sky noise to provide a pixel noise map.\n\u2022 Awavelength solution is determined from fitting the lines of an arc exposure (HeNe or CuAr) taken the afternoon before observations. An absolute shift is calculated for each exposure bymeasuring the positions of the Na 5892\u00c5, [Oi]-5577\u00c5 and 6300\u00c5 sky lines. This is often a significant shift (' 1 pixel) and shows variation with wavelength, and so absolute wavelength measurements should not be trusted to more than the approximate pixel dispersion value of each instrument/grism combination."

We note that our use of unclassified quasar pairs is akin to Nearly Identical Quasars (NIQs) which has been used in recent literature (e.g. Anguita et al. 2018), however the change is simply to include those systems which have low signal-to-noise data and could readily be classified as a likely lensed quasar or binary quasar given deeper spectra.\nExtracted imaging and spectra of systems are respectively shown in Figures 1 and 3 for confirmed lensed, 4 and 5 for likely lensed quasars, and 6 and 7 for unclassified quasar pairs.

In the \ud835\udc54-band of both Pan-STARRS and Legacy Survey imaging, A is brighter\nthan B, however B is brighter in both Gaia (by 0.21 mag in the broad G filter) and in the ground-based red filters, even when including the galaxy in the fit. Absorption is present around 4785\u00c5 and 4890\u00c5 in only the redder image. This system is likely a lens with contamination and reddening by the lensing galaxy coupled with microlensing.

In the 2D spectra, narrow emission lines are seen both 4.6 arcseconds from the main lensing galaxy in the direction of the more distant image, and also 13 arcseconds in the other direction coincident with diffuse extended continuum emission for the latter. These lines are consistent with H\ud835\udefc and Nii emission at the lens galaxy redshift, therefore we attribute the former to a star-forming region in the outskirts of the main lensing galaxy, and the latter to star formation in the outskirts of the galaxy group member to the West. The lensing galaxy has an i-band brightness of 16.22. The low redshift of the lensing galaxy is rare amongst lensed quasars, with the only known lensed quasar with a redshift lower than this being the Einstein cross (Huchra et al. 1985). Another double in our sample, J1526-1400, also has a low-redshift, bright lensing galaxy, so we investigate the expected number of lenses as a function of lensing galaxy brightness after describing J1526-1400 in Section 4.1.42."

            "text": "This system was selected through the Gaia multiplet WISE search, with three Gaia detections (\ud835\udc3a=18.81, 19.07, and 19.60) and W1\u2013 W2=0.95. Archival NOAO DeCAM imaging shows three bright blue point sources around a galaxy. The follow-up NTT-EFOSC2 spectra, positioned to capture light from all three images simultaneously, are low signal-to-noise but clearly show three traces of a z=3.145 quasar. Three \ud835\udc54-band and three \ud835\udc56-band exposures, each of 120s were taken with the Magellan Instant Camera, MagIC. A second galaxy is apparent to the North-West of the system. All six exposures were fit simultaneously as two galaxies and three point\nspread functions, with the PSF being fit as a grid of pixels, and constrained directly from the data (following Ostrovski et al. 2018). Figure 10 shows the colour-image stack (where the green channel is a median of the \ud835\udc54 and \ud835\udc56 bands), and residuals. No counterimage is detected. We repeat the image subtraction but artificially include a point source of increasing brightness until it is obvious in the residuals. This provides an upper limit on any counterimage brightness being 1% as bright as image B, i.e. a \ud835\udc3a-band magnitude of \u223c24.0. One possibility is that this is a rare three image system caused by the straddling of two galaxies. Shin & Evans (2008) provide a comprehensive catalogue of image configurations caused by lensing of two separated galaxies, modelled as Singular Isothermal Spheres. Several configurations allow for three image regions within the resulting caustics, where the third image is not necessarily strongly demagnified. Given that all images lie between the two galaxies, the most likely configuration is 3B-1, following the labelling of Shin & Evans (2008). This naked catastrophe occurs when the two astroid caustics merge in a beak-to-beak calamity (see, e.g., Kassiola et al. 1992; Orban de Xivry & Marshall 2009), but the pseudo-caustics do not overlap, creating a naked merged cusp region. Introducing external shear and mass ellipticity can create naked cusps which are not necessarily merged, again creating source plane regions corresponding to three bright images.\nTo test which is the relevant scenario for J0457-7820, we perform mass models based on the astrometry from fitting the MagIC imaging. We use only the positions to constrain the mass model, since microlensing, extinction, and variability over the time delay can cause optical image fluxes to vary significantly from their macromodel values. This gives us only 6 free parameters. A single SIE model fixed to the main lensing galaxy, predicts a fourth image,\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201330 (2022)\nonly 2.5% the brightness of B. Such an image could be consistent with our 1% detection threshold coupled with reddening and microlensing demagnifying such an image, however, the model is unphysical with an axis ratio of 0.2, and the image positions are not well recovered. Including shear in the model recovers the image positions exactly, but also predicts a fourth image, about 1% as bright as B. The lensing galaxy mass is also less elliptical (0.14) but a large shear of 0.35 is required, in the direction of the second galaxy. We note that this model has more free parameters than constraints, however some parameters are still well-constrained. This model can\nbe forced to have three images with very little change in the mass model parameters and well-fit images (\ud835\udf122 \u223c 0.4). Given the shear direction, we investigate two component mass models. SIS+SIS or SIS+SIE models do not recover the three image positions. An SIE+SIE model fits the images and does not predict a fourth image, however the galaxies are predicted to have large ellipticities and lie in the same direction (\u223c25 degrees North of West). Adding shear to this model reduces the ellipticities of the mass components and still recovers only three images, however, the lens parameters are not as well constrained. We show the caustics of this best-fit model\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201330 (2022)\nin Figure 10. In this instance the cusps do not merge, but since the model is still under-constrained further constraints from the lensed source host galaxy (and limits on a possible fourth image) will be needed to determine more reliable caustic configurations."

The extracted fluxes for the brightest image between the two exposures are in good agreement in the red arm, however in the blue arm they are in disagreement likely due to slit losses and blending.

Including a galaxy and a further PSF fits the data to the noise, so we expect that these are the lensing galaxy and fourth quasar image.

The forced fitting extracts very similar spectra for each component.

We note, however, that no lensing galaxy is seen upon PSF subtraction, but this is often expected to be the case for higher redshift sources (here, z=2.34). An SIEmodel fit to the four image positions showsA is observed brighter than the model, and D is observed fainter.

Spectra were taken at two position angles, each through the bright pair, and clearly show that the source is a z=2.155 BAL quasar with multiple velocity outflows (e.g., Korista et al. 1993). The system is in a high stellar density environment, since it is at a galactic latitude of +5.4\u25e6, an area which has been purposefully omitted from previous searches due to high contamination rates. The strong constraints from requiring four Gaia detections around photometric quasars allows us to now probe such high-density regions. TheGaiamagnitudes are 17.51, 17.58, 19.73, and 19.94, and the system has 3 ROSAT counts within 25\u2032\u2032. The system was targeted for spectroscopic follow-up despite the high stellar density and odd configuration, since the SEDs from optical to infrared wavelengths for all images are similar, and a faint lensing galaxy is seen upon subtraction of the PSFs. The image configuration is peculiar for a quad. When fitting an SIE+shear model to the 4 image positions and relative fluxes, the lensing galaxy position is recovered to within 0.5\u2032\u2032. A model using the galaxy position provides a total magnification of 58, a galaxy mass ellipticity of 0.61, and position angle 34 degrees East of North, with a strong shear of 0.38 at a position angle 126 degrees East of North. This model seems highly unphysical with such a large shear and orthogonal mass and shear axis directions, and is perhaps indicative of the lensing potential not being simple. Indeed, the large Einstein radius of 2.96\u2032\u2032 is suggestive of a galaxy group or cluster acting as the lens. The lens was also independently confirmed by Stern et al. (2021)."

Indeed, the two Gaia detections coupled with the alignment of the background quasar within 2.1\u2032\u2032 of the foreground galaxy strongly suggests the presence of a counterimage.

The best-fit Sersic index is \u223c1, typical of spiral galaxies. The spectra are low signal-to-noise and overlap due to poor seeing and small separation, however binning the spectra shows large differences between them, with different continua, broad emission line profiles, and relative intensities (e.g.Oiii is present in the fainter image).

            "text": "We can compare several features of the lenses we have discovered with those previously known in order to elucidate possible biases in our selection methods and/or those of previous discovery methods. For the following analysis, we compile a list of 224 lensed quasars from the literature, mainly from the database of Lemon et al. (2019), but including those frommore recent publications (e.g., Desira et al. 2022). Since our goal is to find lenses with optically bright images detected byGaia, we remove lenses with noGaia detections, or unmeasured source redshifts. From the known sample, this eliminates 38 lenses, mainly composed of CLASS radio-loud sources, lenses with faint optical images (More et al. 2016; Chan et al. 2022), particularly reddened or high-redshift quasar sources (e.g., Fan et al. 2019), and two systemswhich haveGaia detections but unmeasured or insecure source redshifts: B2108+213 fromMcKean et al. (2005) and J2218-3322 from Chen et al. (2022). It also removes one object from the new sample, J0310-5545, which was serendipitously discovered because of a Gaia detection from a nearby star. This leaves 85 lenses (8 quads, 1 triple, 76 doubles) in our new sample, and 186 (2 five-image lenses, 41 quads, 3 triples, 140 doubles) in the previously known sample. We can immediately compare the multiplicity ratio of the known sample against those of this paper: the ratio of lenses with more than two images to those with just two is 46 to 140 (1 to 3.0), and 9 to 76 (1 to 8.4) respectively. These very different ratios are likely due to the ease of finding quads (generally easily recognisable even without the presence of a bright lensing galaxy) compared to doubles coupled with the bias of following up quad candidates and reporting them in earlier papers or by others (e.g., Schechter et al. 2017; Lucey et al. 2018). It cannot be taken as a bias in our selection since our selection criteria recover all optically bright quads.\nIn Figure 16, we show the source redshift and maximum image separation of these two samples, marking the 16th, 50th, and 84th percentiles, which highlights two marginal differences: (i) the sources of the lensed quasars from this work have a higher median redshift than the known lens sample (1.94 and 1.86 respectively), likely due to redshift constraints of previous searches relying on UV-excess for pre-selection (Oguri et al. 2006); and (ii) the image separation distribution is marginally more peaked than that of the existing sample (medians of 1.83 and 1.77, and standard deviations of 0.92 and 1.07 respectively).While not significantly different populations, these differences can be explained by the cutoff at larger separations in our original selection criteria, and also the cutoff at\nlower separations from our candidates which are likely lenses but do not show lensing galaxies in the shallow existing imaging. The counterparts in the existing sample have already received the necessary deeper follow-up imaging. Including these unclassified quasar pairs as lenses would remove this difference at smaller separations, but exacerbate the redshift offset between the samples. See Section 5.1.3 for a comparison of these samples to mock catalogues, to assess the relevant completeness of known lensed quasars."

We combine the known and new samples of lensed quasars from Section 5.1.1, resulting in 274 lenses (now including those without known source redshifts). We inspect cutouts of the lenses with the detections from both data releases overlaid and note the following:\n\u2022 241 (88%) have equal numbers of Gaia detections between data releases; however in 3 cases detections have been replaced: HS0810+2554 (Reimers et al. 2002), the DR2 detections coincide with one of the bright pair and the Northern image, while EDR3 replaces the Northern image with the South-Eastern image \u2013 interestingly, the first data release catalogues the same images as EDR3; PSJ0840+3550 (Lemon et al. 2018), the counterimage was catalogued in DR2 but in EDR3 it has been removed and the galaxy is catalogued; and SDSSJ1251+2935 (Kayo et al. 2007), the merging pair was catalogued in DR2, but now has just the Southern image of this pair and the Western image catalogued in EDR3.\n\u2022 25 (9%) have gained one detection. For 19 of these, the detection is associated with the lensing galaxy. For 5 (3 quads, 2 doubles), the detection is associated with another image. And for 1, PMNJ0134-0931, it did not previously have a detection in DR2.\n\u2022 7 have lost a detection. 5 (1 quad, 4 doubles) have lost an image detection, 1 double (J1003+0651) has lost a galaxy detection, and 1 quad (SDSSJ1640+1932) has lost both of its image detections and gained a detection of the lensing galaxy.\nFigure 17 shows an assortment of lens systems with the DR2 and EDR3 detections overlaid. Interestingly, for H1413+117, the Gaia position for image C is offset from the true position, i.e. from HST imaging, and has shifted closer to this true position in EDR3, however, it is still inconsistent with the position given the EDR3 positional uncertainty of\u223c6milliarcseconds. Conversely, the positions of the two EDR3 detections in HE1113-0641 seem to be further from the true positions than in DR2.\nTo investigate further these positional offsets as a possible method for finding compact quads and other lenses, we match images between DR2 and EDR3. We record the \ud835\udc3a-band magnitude difference and positional offset for all lensed quasar images clearly belonging to the same component (i.e. galaxy or specific image). For one image of 2M1310-1714 there is no G magnitude in EDR3, so this single image is omitted from our investigation. The distribution of these offsets in position and photometry are shown in Figure 18. The largest positional offsets are those of images in small separation quads, namely H1413+117, HE1113-0641, WFI2026-4536, and J2218-3322 (see Figure 17). In the absence of the raw Gaia data, these offsets suggest a promising avenue for discovering more compact quads through large astrometric offsets between Gaia data releases. However, to properly assess the efficacy of such a method\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201330 (2022)\nwould require understanding the same metric distribution in common contaminants, which is beyond the scope of this paper.\nThere are also several systems with large photometric differences between data releases. These are all systems with bright, low-redshift, lensing galaxies. In the case of the lensing galaxy of J1003+0651, a large increase in flux (positive \ud835\udc3aDR2 \u2212 \ud835\udc3aDR3) is seen, and can be attributed to the counterimage being removed in the most recent data release (see Figure 17). Conversely, several galaxies have a large reduction in flux (e.g., J1526-1400 and J2205+1019), despite having the same detections in both releases. This is likely explained by a combination of deblending problems with a nearby counterimage and the known increase in variability for elongated galaxies due to average scanning direction differences (Riello et al. 2021)."

For this we use an updated version of themock catalogue fromOguri & Marshall (2010). The updates include adopting a galaxy velocity function for all types of galaxies from Bernardi et al. (2010) combined with the redshift evolution predicted by the Illustris cosmological hydrodynamical simulation (Torrey et al. 2015) as described in detail in Oguri (2018), adopting cosmological parameters from the latest Planck satellite mission result (Planck Collaboration et al. 2020), and adopting an improved redshift-dependent model of the external shear.\nWe decide to compare only systems with multiple Gaia detections, since this is where we expect the current selection to be\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201330 (2022)\nmost complete; systems with single Gaia detections can have much fainter images that prevent spectroscopic confirmation. To compare the mock catalogue to the true sky, we limit the area of sky to the typical areas searched for lenses, namely those not too highly contaminated by stars. We define this as any sky area with local Gaia detection densities lower than 20,000 detections per square degree (as measured by the number of detections within a 100 arcsecond radius) and within the Pan-STARRS footprint, i.e. declinations above \u201330 degrees. This leaves 53.9% of the full-sky. We also include limits on image separation of 1 to 4 arcseconds, and source redshifts below 4. These criteria keep 121 known lensed quasars. To provide mock quasars in the catalogue with Gaia magnitudes, we follow Lemon et al. (2019) by using SDSS quasars with both Gaia detections and measured i-band magnitudes, and draw a G-i colour for each mock source from the known quasars within 0.025 in redshift. The number of mocks that pass, normalised to the sky area used for the real lens sample, is \u223c214. The image separation and source redshift distributions are shown in Figure 19.\nThe predicted numbers are in good agreement with the known lenses for larger image separations and redshifts below 1.5. This is naturally explained by prioritising lens candidates with clear signs of a possible lensing galaxy, which is favoured by lower redshift sources and larger image separations.\nThe mock lens catalogue of Yue et al. (2022) underpredicts\nthe number of observed lenses by 44%, suggesting a discrepancy within their imposed galaxy velocity dispersion function, quasar luminosity function, or shear distribution."

            "text": "We classify 11 systems as distinct quasar pairs at very similar redshifts. FollowingHennawi et al. (2010), we take our operational definition of a binary quasar to have measured redshifts within 2000 kms\u22121. This accounts for possible offsets of emission lines from the systemic redshift due to the dynamics of the broad line region, inflows/outflows, and absorption, while also allowing for peculiar velocities of the two quasars while still remaining in the same halo. The best-fit redshifts are found by minimising the \ud835\udf122 of fitting a quasar template using PyQSOFit within a range of redshifts (Guo et al. 2018). Uncertainties are not quoted since they depend strongly on the prior for potential velocity offsets of certain lines. A summary of key parameters is given in Table 2. Of particular interest are the smallest-separation distinct quasar pairs, which probe the latest stage in the merger process and are the least well-characterised population. Only recently have binary quasars below sub-10kpc been discovered above redshift 1 (Inada et al. 2008; Anguita et al. 2018; Tang et al. 2021), due to typical ground-based observing conditions\nMNRAS 000, 1\u201330 (2022)\nand blending at such small angular separations (typically under 1 arcsecond). Lemon et al. (2022) argued that the discovery of the first lensed binary quasar (with a sub-10kpc source) likely suggests a larger population of unlensed small-separation binaries. Several convincing candidate systems are already being found using Gaia and HST follow-up imaging (Shen et al. 2021; Chen et al. 2022). We therefore expect to find such systems as a byproduct of a lensed quasar search. However, systems with residual flux between the putative lensed images are preferentially observed for spectroscopy, which explains our bias towards low-redshift distinct quasar pairs relative to the lensed quasar sources (median redshifts of 0.71 and 1.94 respectively)."

We summarise the key parameters of these pairs in Table 3. Such systems are valuable for understanding quasar feedback by probing the host galaxy of the foreground quasar through absorption of the background quasar continuum (see the Quasars probing quasars paper series, e.g. Hennawi et al. 2006). Studies are typically limited to probing regions above 25 kpc from the foreground quasars (e.g. Johnson et al. 2015), since samples are built only from well-separated quasars (more likely to both have been targeted for spectroscopy). Of particular interest are the systems with small transverse proper distances (i.e. under 20 kpc) since they are both intrinsically rare (P(\ud835\udc51) \u223c \ud835\udc512), and are harder to discover due to observational constraints (e.g. systems become blended in ground-based imaging and are therefore not selected for spectroscopic follow-up as quasars). There are discrepancies between simulations and observations regarding Ly\ud835\udefc absorption statistics below 100kpc in quasar host galaxies (Prochaska et al. 2013; Sorini et al. 2020), suggesting observational constraints on the absorption properties at small projected separationswill be key to constrainingmore advanced feedback models.\nThe QSO pair Spectral Database of Findlay et al. (2018) lists only 4 projected quasar pairs with angular separations under 3 arcseconds and velocity differences above 2000 kms\u22121(after removing known lensed quasars and spurious cross-matches), compared to \u223c3000 such pairs with projections under 30 arcseconds. Sub10-kpc-separation projected pairs from the literature have come from lens searches: DESJ0215\u20134728 (\ud835\udc4f=6.3 kpc, \ud835\udc67fg=0.467, 1.07\u2032\u2032) from Anguita et al. (2018), J0240\u20130208 (\ud835\udc4f=7.6 kpc, \ud835\udc67fg=1.058,\n0.94\u2032\u2032) from Shalyapin et al. (2018) and Anguita et al. (2018), and J2251+0016 (\ud835\udc4f=10.0 kpc, \ud835\udc67fg=0.41, 1.86\u2032\u2032) from Tang et al. (2021). The projected quasars presented in this work almost triple the number of systems probing the foreground galaxies within 10 kpc (from 3 to 8 systems).\nThe number of such systems expected at each separation can be predicted through well-constrained quasar luminosity functions, along with the predicted luminosity and redshift distributions. We investigate this using the quasar luminosity function from Ross et al. (2013). We recover both the redshift distribution and absolute numbers of the spectroscopically confirmed quasar sample in a 500 square degree patch of SDSS. We estimate a sky density of quasars (0 < \ud835\udc67 < 4) with \ud835\udc56-band magnitude above 20.7 of \u224830.0 per square degree. In an area of 20,000 square degrees, this predicts 110 pairs within 5 arcseconds, and 17 pairs within 2 arcseconds. Several other studies report sub-2\u2032\u2032 projected pairs (Inada et al. 2008; More et al. 2016; Schechter et al. 2017). Including the previously mentioned systems, the total is \u223c10, below the predicted number which was a conservative value given some components of the known systems have \ud835\udc56 > 20.7. Designing searches to find these missing projected pairs should be considered in future lensed quasar and quasar pair searches.\nFinally, we note that some of these systems could still be acting as strong lenses when the foreground galaxy is massive enough, and any counterimage is blended with the foreground host and is undetected in both the available low signal-to-noise imaging and spectra. High-resolution follow-up imaging would provide strong constraints on any such strong lensing, and, in the case of no detection, can still be used to obtain constraints on the mass profile (Smith et al. 2018)."

We also report 25 further unclassified quasar pairs which likely contain a mixture of lenses and distinct quasar pairs at the same redshift, however, further data is required in each case. We present 11 projected quasar pairs, and 11 binary pairs, which substantially increases the population of known systems at angular separations of a few arcseconds and below.\nWe used a mock catalogue of lensed quasars with an updated quasar luminosity function, galaxy velocity dispersion function, and treatment of shear to compare the current population of known lensed quasars with multipleGaia detections. We show that the majority of lensed quasars with sources below redshift 1.5 are known, however, almost half of lenses with sources above z=1.5 are yet to be discovered, which mostly have image separations below 1.5\u2032\u2032. The likely and possible lensed quasars discovered in this work represent already a subset of these missing lenses.\nWith the goal of creating amagnitude-limited sample of lensed quasars, future Gaia data releases should help through increasing completeness in detections at small separations, and reliable classification of quasars through increased precision of proper motions and parallaxes, as well as better variability constraints due to a longer baseline. To test for the completeness and biases of each lens search, other searches making use of spectroscopic and cadenced photometric datasets will be crucial. Such searches in LSST, making use of detecting nearby or extended variability, should not only be an efficient method for selecting lensed quasars but also for selecting small-separation physical quasar pairs and projected quasars (Kochanek et al. 2006; Chao et al. 2020). As targets become fainter and more numerous \u2013 with up to 400 lensed quasars with measured time delays in LSST (Liao et al. 2015) \u2013 a complete survey for spectroscopic redshifts must be carefully designed to convert these delays into a powerful probe of measuring the Hubble constant, with special consideration to minimising follow-up of common contaminants."
