    "abstractText": "The widespread nature of heat-resistant alloys is associated with the difficulties in their mechanical machining. It forces the use of the wire electrical discharge machining to be wider. The productivity, roughness, and dimensions of the modified layer of the machined surfaces are indicators of the machining quality. The search for new diagnostic parameters that can expand the information content of the operational monitoring/diagnostics of wire electrical discharge machining and accompany the currently used electrical parameters\u2019 data is an urgent research task. The article presents the studies of the relationship between the parameters of acoustic emission signals accompanying wire electrical discharge machining of heat-resistant alloys, process quality indicators, and characteristics of discharge pulses. The results are presented as mathematical expressions and graphs demonstrating the experimentally obtained dependencies. The research focuses on the formed white layer during wire electrical discharge machining. Pictures of thin cross-sections of the machined surfaces with traces of the modified layer are provided. The issues of crack formation in the modified layer and base materials are considered.",

            "text": "Electrical discharge machining refers to technologies based on exposure to the surface of the workpiece with CEF (concentrated energy flows) [1\u20134]. The use of this technology is dictated by a modern approach to the manufacturing of products from materials that are difficult to process by traditional methods [5\u20137]. The main advantage of EDM technologies is that they allow for the processing of any conductive materials from which parts of the aviation and space industry are made. These parts often have a complex shape and are made of heat-resistant alloys that are difficult to process with a blade tool. During EDM, a series of electrical discharges are formed in the gap between the tool electrode and the surface of the workpiece. Each discharge causes the local melting and evaporation of electrode materials, forming a new surface. The obtained properties of the surface texture depend on the electrode materials, the type of dielectric, and the parameters of the applied pulses [8\u201310]. All the conditions that determine the method of introducing thermal energy into the interelectrode gap form the rate of removal of the workpiece material and the quality indicators of the resulting surface of the workpiece and the surface layer. Concentrated energy flows have a significant impact on the properties of the surface: its resistance to abrasion, corrosion resistance, and thermal effects [11\u201313]. EDM technology research is traditionally focused on increasing the performance of the process and improving the quality of the resulting surfaces. We should also not forget about the most critical aspect of research aimed at deepening knowledge about the physical\nSensors 2023, 23, 8288. https://doi.org/10.3390/s23198288 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/sensors\nSensors 2023, 23, 8288 2 of 17\nphenomena that accompany the EDM processes. This knowledge makes it possible to develop algorithms for finding the most rational processing modes and contribute to the creation of automated equipment built in sections that operate without the participation of operators. The design of such equipment requires its saturation with the means of obtaining information, with the help of which it is possible to obtain real-time information about the current state of the treatment process. This is necessary for the automatic correction of modes and the elimination of negative situations associated with short circuits [5], with conditions that threaten to break the wire electrode and with a decrease in the quality of the resulting surfaces [14\u201316]. The electrical parameters of discharge pulses generated in the interelectrode gap are traditionally used as a source of information about the progress of the workflow in the equipment for EDM. Based on this information, the pulse utilization coefficient is determined, by which it is possible to judge the state of the interelectrode gap and regulate the electrode feed rate [17\u201320]. This approach is used in most modern WEDM machines. However, this approach has its drawbacks, leading to the fact that, in the natural process, the treatment is accompanied by both short circuits and breaks of the wire electrode. The situation worsens when processing new materials with low electrical conductivity, such as cermet [5,10]. To study the features of the WEDM of such materials, and to expand the informative capabilities of monitoring systems, researchers are trying to attract new sources of information about the course of the technological process. The possibility of using temperature control of the working surfaces of the electrodes and monitoring the hydraulic resistance of the interelectrode gap was investigated in the 1970s [20]. Still, the complexity of the implementation of these methods did not allow for their widespread use in modern WEDM equipment. As additional sources of information on the course of the WEDM process in the literature, one can find works concerning the analysis of acoustic emission signals accompanying the process [21\u201324]. The presented article describes the results of experiments with the EDM of a nickelbased heat-resistant alloy NiCr20TiAl (standards EN 10269, DIN 17742). The alloy is used to manufacture bars, disks, rings, turbine blades, and other parts operating at temperatures up to 750 \u25e6C. The alloy is used in turbine seals, shut-off valves, heaters, and control devices of various reactors. During the EDM of the alloy, the parameters of the applied pulses were varied; during processing, the voltage, discharge current, and acoustic emission signals were recorded [21,25]. During processing, the average wire electrode feed rate was determined; after processing, the parameters of the resulting surface roughness, the volume of the removed material, and the volume of the white layer formed per unit of time were determined [26\u201328]. Acoustic emission signals (AE signals) are widely used in mechanical engineering to monitor the condition of nodes and predict incipient defects. In the literature, you can find many articles with research results on the possibilities of monitoring the technological processes of traditional treatment by monitoring acoustic signals [29\u201332]. It was shown in [2,5] that acoustic monitoring can also be applied to technologies for processing with concentrated energy flows. These are laser processing, electron beam doping, and EDM. At the same time, it was noted that VA monitoring can be carried out in different frequency ranges, which makes it possible to monitor changes in the power density of thermal energy entering the surface of the workpiece in order to evaluate the displacement of the technological process toward the melting of the material or vaporization and plasma formation [33\u201336]. The purpose of this work was to study the interrelations of the acoustic emission parameters accompanying EDM with the processing output characteristics, which include the performance and quality of the resulting surface. As elements of the scientific novelty of the presented material, we can note the identified connections between the parameters of acoustic signals and the quality characteristics of WEDM processing: the rate of formation of white layer volumes, the rate of removal of workpiece material, and the roughness of the resulting surface. The described phenomenon\nSensors 2023, 23, 8288 3 of 17\nof the formation of cracks in the white layer in the boundary zones between the grains of the processed material can also be attributed to scientific novelty."

When varying the modes, different values of the current pulse time (Ton) and pulse amplitude (I) were set; other factors were kept constant, including the location of the accelerometer. The time between pulses did not change; in all experiments, it was 200 \u00b5s. The voltage was also constant 84 V. To evaluate the performance in each experiment, the distance covered by the wire electrode-tool in 30 s was recorded (slot length), and the average slot width was measured. The product of the width of the slot and its length corresponds to the area of the slot, which, at a constant thickness of the workpiece, is proportional to the extracted volume of material in 30 s. Accordingly, this volume, converted into a unit of time, determines the performance of the process (S). Table 5 shows the modes used in each experiment and indicates the performance value S as a percentage of the maximum value obtained in experiment No. 16. The value of S was used to evaluate the performance of WEDM in each experiment.\nSensors 2023, 23, 8288 5 of 17\nTable 5.

It was stated in [2,5] that amplitude changes in different frequency ranges can display other phase transitions when a substance is exposed to a concentrated energy flow (CEF). In this regard, three frequency ranges were selected, and the informative capabilities of them had to be evaluated. The choice of ranges was made based on the analysis of AE signal spectra. Frequency ranges were selected where amplitude changes were most pronounced. This usually happens near spectral maxima, which depend on the natural frequencies of the elastic system of the machine, where the workpiece and the accelerometer are located. In Figure 2, the first local maximum is present around 6 kHz. At higher frequencies, local maxima can be noted around 10 and 16 kHz. This is followed by a series of small-amplitude local maxima, of which it is difficult to single out one. Eventually, three frequency ranges were allocated: 4\u20138; 9\u201323; and 23\u201333 kHz. These ranges were named low-frequency, mid-frequency, and high-frequency ranges. The root-mean-square (RMS) amplitudes for these ranges were named \u04101, \u04102, and \u04103, respectively. Table 6 for 16 experiments shows the RMS amplitudes for all selected ranges. The amplitude values are percentages of the maximum value in 16 experiments. This is carried out for a more visual representation on the graphs of parameters that have a significant discrepancy in absolute units of measurement.\nAs shown in [2,5], AE signals accompany not only the processes of the melting and evaporation of materials but also the processes of the propagation of thermal stress waves, phase rearrangement, and crystallization. In this work, an attempt was made to relate the formation processes of a white layer (WL) on the workpiece surface after WEDM with the performance and parameters of the AE signals. To accomplish this, in each experiment, sections were made perpendicular to the position of the wire electrode during processing, from which photographs were taken using an Olympus BX51M optical microscope (Ryf AG, Grenchen, Switzerland). Figure 3 shows examples of such pictures, where the WL thickness is shown for individual sections. Each section was pre-polished and etched with a 5% solution of nitric acid in alcohol.\nFigure 2.

The photographs show pores and loose formations on the WL surface. However, it is the WL thickness that is more often used as its quantitative characteristic [6,8,12,19,20]. To understand the relation between WEDM performance and WL formation intensity and AE signals, the WL volume formation rate (Vw) was estimated. Since the performance of WEDM is evaluated by the volumes of material removed per unit of time, it is more correct to also assess the intensity of WL formation by the volumes formed per unit of time. This will be the WL volume formation rate (Vw). To evaluate Vw, the WL area was determined using the special software JMicroVision (Version V 1.3.4). With the help of this software, the perimeter of the white layer was outlined in the photo, and the area of the figure inside the perimeter in pixels was calculated. This area is proportional to the volume WL, since the thickness of the workpiece was constant. Figure 4 shows an example of a photograph of a WL with a perimeter circled.\nFigure 3.

The Relations between the WL Formation Rate, Performance, and AE Parameters The processing of the data of Tables 5\u20137 using the experimental planning methodology allowed us to construct mathematical models and graphs showing the relation of AE parameters with the rate of formation of the white layer (Vw). Figure 5 shows the dependence of Vw (A1, A2) in general form and the form of projections of individual sections on coordinate planes. In Figure 5 a, b, the colors of the rainbow emphasize the curvature of the surface: a shift from blue to red indicates the convexity of the surface. The same principle holds true for the other color graph figures in this article.\nSensors 2023, 23, 8288 9 of 17\nAs a result of mathematical processing, the analytical dependence Vw (A1, A2) and its graphic images were built. Since the resulting mathematical model made it possible to extrapolate the dependencies to areas remote from the area of the experiments, the areas where the real experimental points were located are marked with yellow polygons in the graphs in Figure 5. These areas can be treated with the greatest confidence. Respectively, the yellow perimeter can be called the confidence perimeter (CP). Outside of the CP, the results of mathematical modeling should be taken into account with caution. The mathematical model is represented by expression (1):\nVw (A1, A2) = 4.4418 \u2212 0.5787\u00b7A1 + 0.3365\u00b7A2 + 0.0079\u00b7A12 \u2212 0.0122\u00b7A22 + 0.0173\u00b7A1\u00b7A2 (1)\nThe standard deviation (SD) was 9.1%. An analysis of the graphs in Figure 5 shows that with the growth of A1, the rate of increase in the volume of WL steadily increases (Figure 5c). At Vw < 20%, the influence of A2 is observed, but at higher values of Vw, the impact of A2 decreases. The effect of A2 is clearly seen in Figure 5d. This influence is extreme, but the extremum is rather sluggish. In the region of CP, variations of A2 at a high WL growth rate change Vw within 10%. A slight decrease in Vw with increasing A2 is especially noticeable at a low Vw. This can be explained by the increased fraction of the evaporated substance noted in [2,5]. By analogy with Figure 5, the dependence Vw (A1, A3) was built, and the graphical constructions are shown in Figure 6.\nSensors 2023, 23, x FOR PEER REVIEW 9 of 17\nthe yellow perimeter can be called the confidence perimeter (CP). Outside of the CP, the results of mathematical modeling should be taken into account with caution.

An analysis of the graphs in Figure 5 shows that with the growth of \u04101, the rate of increase in the volume of WL steadily increases (Figure 5c). At Vw \u02c2 20%, the influence of \u04102 is observed, but at higher values of Vw, the impact of \u04102 decreases. The effect of \u04102 is clearly seen in Figure 5d. This influence is extreme, but the extremum is rather sluggish. In the region of \u0421\u0420, variations of \u04102 at a high WL growth rate change Vw within 10%. A slight decrease in Vw with increasing \u04102 is especially noticeable at a low Vw. This can be explained by the increased fraction of the evaporated substance not d in [2,5].\nBy analog re 5, the dependence Vw (A1, A3) was built, and the graphical constructions are i Figure 6.\nSensors 2023, 23, 8288 10 of 17\nThe SD model error (2) was 11.6%. The analysis of dependencies in Figure 6 shows that the influence of A1 remains dominant, and the impact of A3 has changed compared to that of A2. An increase in A3 in the CP area leads to a decrease in Vw. This reduction is within 10% at large values of Vw. For small values of Vw, this decrease is more noticeable. If, in Figure 5d, the decline in Vw began at large values of A2, then, in Figure 6d, the reduction in the growth rate of WL begins with small values of A3. This suggests that the intensification of the evaporation of the material can contribute to a reduction in the rate of WL formation. The increase in the amplitude of the AE components in the high-frequency range relative to the amplitudes at low frequencies indicates an increase in the power density of the incoming energy. In this case, the proportion of material removed due to evaporation and ionization increases [2,5]. Many literature sources investigate the relationship between WL and processing modes and WEDM quality indicators [6,8,19,20,35]. In particular, various options are proposed for the relation between the thickness of the modified layer and the roughness of the resulting surface, with the energy of discharge pulses, with the performance, and with the duration of the pulses. In this work, we estimated not the thickness of WL but the rate of formation of its volume Vw. The data presented above in Tables 3\u20135 made it possible to determine the relation between Vw and the characteristics of the treatment process and the parameters of the AE signals. In Figure 7, the graphical representations show the relation of Vw to the WEDM performance and the set pulse duration.

The Relation between Surface Roughness, Performance, and AE Parameters The roughness of the surface obtained after WEDM is also one of the indicators of the quality of processing. In the literature, the resulting value of Rz, as well as the thickness of WL, is associated with the energy of discharge pulses. In [19], it is stated that Rz has a linear relation with the thickness of the modified layer. You can find references to other types of dependencies, where the Rz indicator monotonically increases with increasing performance or pulse energy, but according to a power dependence, the exponent is 0.3\u2013 0.42 [20,27]. Therefore, the relation of Rz with performance, pulse parameters, and AE signals is interesting. Figure 9 shows the dependence Rz (S, Ton).\n(a) (b)\nFigure 8.

The surface layer combines several layers, of which the white layer is given the most attention. This is because before carrying out further operations after WEDM, it is necessary to decide whether the white layer needs to be removed.\nThe results of the research can be the following:\n- Acoustic emission signals accompanying WEDM can be reliably recorded using an accelerometer installed on the machine table at a great distance from the processing zone in the frequency range up to 40 kHz. - As a parameter characterizing the formation of a white layer, a value proportional to the volume of the white layer formed per time unit was determined. Experiments have shown a close-to-linear relation between the rate of formation of the white layer and the RMS amplitude of the AE signal in a relatively low-frequency range of 4\u20138 kHz. The correlation with the AE signal components at higher frequencies was noticeably smaller. - Experiments have shown that the rate of formation of the volumes of the white layer is almost proportional to the performance of the WEDM process, and it practically does not depend on the pulse duration. - The relation of performance with acoustic emission signals is close to linear in the range of 4\u20138 kHz and is hardly noticeable at higher frequencies. The linear relation is more stable for high and medium performance, while the random component increases at low performance. - Surface roughness increases in WEDM performance, but this relation can only be approximated by a linear relation at low to medium performance. At higher performance, the roughness values reach saturation and practically do not change. From the duration of the pulses, the roughness varies within 10\u201315%, increasing in the region of 20 \u00b5s and decreasing for shorter and longer pulses. - The increase in the amplitude of acoustic emission signals in the high-frequency range compared to the amplitudes at low frequencies is associated with a decrease in roughness. This is especially noticeable at low and medium process performance. - Based on the results of studying the relationship between the parameters of acoustic emission signals and the performance and quality indicators of WEDM processes, it can be concluded that they can serve as additional diagnostic parameters used for the automatic control of the treatment process. This conclusion takes into account the possibility of acoustic emission signal parameters indicating an increase in the concentration of erosion products in the electrode gap in order to inform about the danger of short circuits and wire electrode breaks noted in other publications [2,5]. - During the study of the white layer using a scanning electron microscope, an example of the development of cracks was found not from the white layer towards the base material but in the opposite direction. This allowed us to assume the existence of a mechanism for forming cracks in the white layer due to different coefficients of thermal expansion of the base material and the white layer. This leads to the stretching and consolidation of the pores of the white layer and the formation of cracks.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, S.N.G.; methodology, M.P.K.; software, A.P.M., A.N.P. and Y.A.M.; validation, Y.A.M.; formal analysis, V.D.G. and Y.A.M.; investigation, M.P.K., A.P.M. and A.N.P.; resources, A.N.P.; data curation, M.P.K. and V.D.G.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, S.N.G.; writing\u2014review and editing, M.P.K.; visualization, A.P.M., A.N.P. and Y.A.M.; supervision, S.N.G. and M.P.K.; project administration, M.P.K.; funding acquisition, S.N.G.
