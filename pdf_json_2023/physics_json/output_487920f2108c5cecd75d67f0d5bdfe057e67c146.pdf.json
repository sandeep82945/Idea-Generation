    "abstractText": "NPM1 is an abundant nucleolar chaperone that, in addition to facilitating ribosome biogenesis, contributes to nucleolar stress responses and tumor suppression through its regulation of the p14 Alternative Reading Frame tumor suppressor protein (p14ARF). Oncogenic stress induces p14ARF to inhibit MDM2, stabilize p53 and arrest the cell cycle. Under non-stress conditions, NPM1 stabilizes p14ARF in nucleoli, preventing its degradation and blocking p53 activation. However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of p14ARF by NPM1 are unclear because the structural features of the p14ARF-NPM1 complex remain elusive. Here we show that NPM1 sequesters p14ARF within phase-separated condensates, facilitating the assembly of p14ARF into a gel-like meso-scale network. This assembly is mediated by intermolecular contacts formed by hydrophobic residues in an \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-strands within a partially folded N-terminal domain of p14ARF. Those hydrophobic interactions promote phase separation with NPM1, enhance nucleolar partitioning of p14ARF, restrict p14ARF and NPM1 diffusion within condensates and in nucleoli, and reduce cell viability. Our structural model provides novel insights into the multifaceted chaperone function of NPM1 in nucleoli by mechanistically linking the nucleolar localization of p14ARF to its partial folding and meso-scale assembly upon phase separation with",

Oncogenic\nstress induces p14ARF to inhibit MDM2, stabilize p53 and arrest the cell cycle. Under non-stress\nconditions, NPM1 stabilizes p14ARF in nucleoli, preventing its degradation and blocking p53\nactivation. However, the mechanisms underlying the regulation of p14ARF by NPM1 are unclear\nbecause the structural features of the p14ARF-NPM1 complex remain elusive. Here we show that\nNPM1 sequesters p14ARF within phase-separated condensates, facilitating the assembly of\np14ARF into a gel-like meso-scale network. This assembly is mediated by intermolecular contacts\nformed by hydrophobic residues in an \u03b1-helix and \u03b2-strands within a partially folded N-terminal\ndomain of p14ARF. Those hydrophobic interactions promote phase separation with NPM1,\nenhance nucleolar partitioning of p14ARF, restrict p14ARF and NPM1 diffusion within condensates\nand in nucleoli, and reduce cell viability. Our structural model provides novel insights into the\nmultifaceted chaperone function of NPM1 in nucleoli by mechanistically linking the nucleolar\nlocalization of p14ARF to its partial folding and meso-scale assembly upon phase separation with"

Arf\nis induced in response to oncogene activation, e.g., Myc and Ras signaling, and binds MDM2,\nan E3 ubiquitin ligase for p53, leading to MDM2 inhibition, p53 stabilization and cell cycle arrest\n1. In proliferating cells, Arf is maintained at low levels and localizes to the granular component\n(GC) of the nucleolus through its interaction with Nucleophosmin (NPM1) 2,3.\nTight regulation of nucleolar Arf by NPM1 maintains stable pools of Arf, NPM1, and\nMDM2 4. NPM1 regulates Arf stability by binding Arf and sequestering it in the nucleolus, and\ndisruption of the Arf-NPM1 interaction releases Arf from nucleoli and induces proteasomal\ndegradation of Arf in the nucleus 5,6. In addition, binding of respiratory cytochrome c to NPM1,\ncauses an extended-to-compact conformational change in NPM1, triggering p19Arf release 7.\nSimilarly, binding of p14ARF by GLTSCR2 blocks the p14ARF-NPM1 interaction, enhancing p14ARF\nnuclear translocation and degradation 8. Furthermore, p19Arf mutants which lack conserved N-\nterminal segments fail to bind NPM1 and are rapidly degraded 5. Release from NPM1 facilitates\nArf targeting of MDM2 9 and occurs in response to various stressors, including DNA damage 7,10\nand nucleolar disruption 11,12. Conversely, Arf overexpression induces NPM1 degradation\nthrough the SUMO pathway 13. Thus, interactions with NPM1 in the nucleolus are critical for\nregulating Arf stability and function.\nNucleoli are liquid-like membrane-less organelles (MLOs) assembled in part through\nliquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) 14,15. NPM1 forms pentamers and mediates the assembly\nof the GC in part through multivalent interactions of acidic tracts (A-tracts, A2 and A3) within its\ncentral intrinsically disordered region (IDR) with multivalent arginine-rich motifs (R-motifs) in\nnucleolar proteins, e.g., ribosomal proteins and non-ribosomal proteins such as SURF6 16,17.\nInteraction with NPM1 facilitates the localization of R-motif proteins to nucleoli 16,18. p14ARF\ncontains several multivalent R-motifs, which are required for nucleolar localization and are\nmutated in certain cancers, causing redistribution of p14ARF throughout the cell 19,20. Purified\nNPM1 undergoes phase separation with R-motif proteins in vitro, forming condensates that\nmimic the liquid-like features of the nucleolus 15. We previously showed that p14ARF promotes\nphase separation when mixed with NPM1 in vitro, and that the presence of p14ARF attenuates\nNPM1 mobility within condensates 21.\nTo gain insight into the molecular basis of p14ARF-NPM1 interactions in the nucleolus,\nhere we characterize the structure and dynamics of p14ARF and NPM1 within condensates using\nan integrated structural biology approach, encompassing solution- and solid-state nuclear\nmagnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and small-angle neutron scattering (SANS). We found\nthat p14ARF forms meso-scale assemblies within condensates with NPM1, mediated by\nintermolecular hydrophobic interactions between p14ARF residues within a partially folded N-\nterminal domain. Based on this information, we hypothesized that hydrophobic interactions\nmediated by p14ARF cause NPM1 immobilization within condensates in vitro and reduced NPM1\ndiffusion in nucleoli. We found that substitution mutagenesis to block p14ARF hydrophobic\ninteractions restored p14ARF and NPM1 mobility in condensates while reducing the propensity\nfor phase separation. In cells, p14ARF and NPM1 exhibited reduced diffusion and mobility in\nnucleoli, consistent with the formation of higher order p14ARF-NPM1 assemblies. This correlated\nwith p14ARF levels and was dependent upon hydrophobic residues within the p14ARF N-terminal\ndomain. These results demonstrate that although the R-motifs are sufficient to induce phase\nseparation of NPM1, the hydrophobicity of p14ARF potentiates phase separation and is required\nfor the restriction of p14ARF and NPM1 within the nucleolus. Based on our model, NPM1\npromotes sequestration of p14ARF in nucleoli by facilitating the phase separation and partial\nfolding of p14ARF."

            "text": "p14ARF Exhibits Local and Long-Range Ordering within Condensates with NPM1\nPentameric NPM1 engages its binding partners in part through multivalent electrostatic\ninteractions of its disordered A2 and A3 acidic tracts (Fig. 1A) and R-motifs in partner proteins.\np14ARF contains several multivalent R-motifs (termed R1-3) (Fig. 1B, Supplementary Table 1).\np14ARF also displays three well-conserved N-terminal clusters of hydrophobic residues (termed\nH1-H3) (Supplementary Fig. 1), two of which are predicted by ZipperBD 22 and PSI-PRED4 23 to\nform aggregation-prone \u03b1-helical and \u03b2-sheet secondary structures (Fig. 1B). To gain insight\ninto the structural organization within phase-separated p14ARF-NPM1 complexes, we applied\ncontrast variation small-angle neutron scattering (CV-SANS). This approach leverages the\ndifferences in the neutron scattering length densities of protons and deuterons to isolate the\nscattering contributions from select biomolecules in complex mixtures through protein\nperdeuteration (replacement of H-atoms with D-atoms) and adjustment of the H2O/D2O ratio\nwithin buffers 24. Fitting the CV-SANS curve of p14ARF-NPM1 condensates under p14ARF-\nmatched conditions (only scattering from NPM1 detected) to a correlation length model (Fig. 1C,\ngreen trace; Supplementary Table 2, see Methods for fitting procedure) suggests that the IDRs\nof pentameric NPM1 16,17 are in extended conformations in condensates. Strikingly, the CV-\nSANS curves for p14ARF-NPM1 condensates under full-scattering conditions (scattering from\nboth NPM1 and p14ARF detected) and NPM1-matched conditions (only scattering from p14ARF\ndetected) exhibited prominent Bragg peaks (Fig. 1C; grey and blue traces, respectively). The\nCV-SANS curve from NPM1-matched conditions was fit to a broad peak model, which revealed that p14ARF molecules also assume extended conformations (\ud835\udf10 = 0.66) and form a meso-scale (10-100 nm) assembly with a characteristic intermolecular spacing, d \u2248 180\u00c5, within the\ncondensed phase with NPM1 (Fig. 1C). This assembly appears branched at the longest length scales measured (\ud835\udf10 = 0.35) with inter-chain contacts 25 occurring over a distance of ~160 \u00c5. Meso-scale ordering of this type is common within phase-separated materials, e.g., polymer\ngels, and can be caused by physical crosslinks 24.\nWe next sought to characterize the residue-level structure of p14ARF within condensates\nwith NPM1 and to identify sites of intra- and intermolecular p14ARF contacts using solution-state\nNMR spectroscopy. The two-dimensional transverse relaxation-optimized spectroscopy,\nheteronuclear single-quantum 1H-15N correlation (2D 1H-15N TROSY-HSQC) spectrum of\n[13C,15N]-p14ARF within condensates with unlabeled NPM1 revealed resonances for a subset of\nresidues (Supplementary Fig. 2). Using triple-resonance NMR methods (see Methods), these\nwere assigned to residues in the C-terminal region of p14ARF, following R-motif R3 (Fig. 1B,\nSupplementary Table 3), indicating that this region of p14ARF is disordered in condensates with\nNPM1. In contrast, N-terminal p14ARF residues showed extensive resonance broadening and\ncould not be analyzed using solution-state NMR methods.\nWe reasoned that resonance broadening resulted from limited mobility of p14ARF within\nits phase-separated meso-scale assemblies, as indicated by previous fluorescence recovery\nafter photobleaching (FRAP) results 21. Therefore, we applied cross-polarization magic-angle\nspinning solid-state NMR (CP-MAS ssNMR) methods, which can detect resonances for both\nmobile and immobile segments of proteins within condensates 21 (Supplementary Table 4, Fig.\n1D, Supplementary Fig. 3). Analysis of multiple two- and three-dimensional ssNMR spectra\nenabled resonance assignments for residues within the p14ARF N-terminus (Supplementary\nFigs. 4, 5; Supplementary Table 5; see Methods). Analysis of secondary 13C chemical shifts,\nwhich report on secondary structure, revealed that the N-terminal domain (NTD) of p14ARF,\nwhich is disordered in isolation26, adopts \u03b1-helical and \u03b2-strand secondary structure in\ncondensates with NPM1 (Fig. 1E).\nConsistent with the findings from CV-SANS, we observed only one intra-molecular\ncontact in p14ARF, between T8 and H26, in 2D 13C-13C dipolar assisted rotational resonance\n(CC-DARR) spectra at long mixing times (200 ms and above; Supplementary Fig. 6A),\nsuggesting that compact conformations are not highly populated or form only transiently. To\nprobe for inter-molecular p14ARF\u2013p14ARF contacts, we recorded NHHC spectra27 for a p14ARF-\nNPM1 condensate containing a 1\u22361 mixture of independently 15N- or 13C-labeled p14ARF molecules, to ensure that only inter-molecular 15N\u221213C correlations were detected 28. The\nresulting spectrum showed a high degree of similarity to DARR spectra, demonstrating that\nstructured regions within the p14ARF N-terminus engage in inter-molecular contacts\n(Supplementary Fig. 6B). Furthermore, based on the low signal-to-noise ratio observed for\nNHHC spectra, persistent p14ARF contacts either constitute a minor state or occur over long\ndistances.\nStructural model for p14ARF within p14ARF-NPM1 condensed phase\nNext, we visualized the structure of p14ARF within the condensed phase with NPM1 by\nintegrating constraints obtained from analysis of NMR and CV-SANS data into a structural\nensemble model (Supplementary Fig. 7, see Methods). First, we used PSI-PRED4 29 to predict\nresidue-level p14ARF secondary structure. We then used Flexible Meccano 30 to generate large\nensembles of conformers (10,000), where the secondary structure propensity of non-structured\nregions was systematically varied from random coil to \u03b2-sheet/poly-proline type II (PPII), in a\ncooperative or non-cooperative manner. These structural ensembles were processed using\nCryson 31 and ShiftX2 32 to calculate polymer scaling factors, and predict chemical shifts for\neach conformer, respectively. Finally, we applied Bayesian statistics 33 to calculate the\nprobability of each conformer based on experimental SANS and NMR data and selected a\nrefined p14ARF ensemble containing the highest probability conformers (Supplementary Fig. 8A-"

            "text": "The refined p14ARF ensemble exhibited a mean C\u03b1-C\u03b1 distance of 80 \u00b1 31\u00c5 (Fig. 2A) and\na mean scaling factor \ud835\udf10\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc60 = 0.659 \u00b1 0.001 (Fig. 2B), which are in agreement with the experimental values (\ud835\udf090= 85 \u00b1 31\u00c5 and \ud835\udf10 = 0.659 \u00b1 0.296, respectively). Furthermore, the ensemble average predicted chemical shifts showed good agreement with experimental NMR\ndata (Fig. 2C, D, Supplementary Fig. 8D-F). The resulting model shows p14ARF in extended\nconformations that expose the hydrophobic surfaces and R-motifs (Fig. 2E). In this way, p14ARF\nmay engage in inter-molecular interactions with both itself and NPM1 within the condensed\nphase.\nTo model p14ARF within the meso-scale p14ARF-NPM1 assembly, we used D+ 34 to\nassemble the refined p14ARF ensemble into domains of diverse sizes and space groups, with a\nchi-squared minimization yielding the best model. We obtained the best agreement with\nexperimental data for p14ARF in a 4 x 3 domain with 2D rectangular symmetry and X, Y lattice\npoint distances of 180 \u00c5 and 200 \u00c5, respectively (Fig. 2F, G). Examination of intermolecular C\u03b1-\nC\u03b1 distances within the meso-scale p14ARF assembly revealed characteristic spacings of ~200\nand ~400 \u00c5 (Supplementary Fig. 8G). Consistent with the low signal-to-noise ratio observed in\nthe NHHC spectrum, only a small subset of close-range interchain distances were observed\n(<30 \u00c5). The final model shows an ensemble of p14ARF molecules assembled in an ordered\nlattice, which permits conformers at individual lattice points to assume a high degree of\nconformational disorder (Fig. 2G). Furthermore, the p14ARF meso-scale pores can accommodate\nNPM1 pentamers (~60 \u00c5 correlation length; Fig. 1C).\nNPM1 IDR remains disordered within the condensed phase with p14ARF\nWe previously applied CP-MAS ssNMR to show that the N-terminal NPM1\noligomerization domain (OD) retains secondary structure in condensates with p14ARF and\nexperiences limited mobility 21. However, we detected no resonances corresponding to residues\nin the NPM1 central IDR or the C-terminal, nucleic acid binding domain (NBD), suggesting that\nthese structural elements remain dynamic. Here, we applied solution-state NMR to probe the\nstructure and dynamics of the NPM1 IDR within p14ARF-NPM1 condensates. 2D 1H-15N TROSY-\nHSQC spectra for [13C, 15N]-NPM1 showed resonances for residues in the IDR, although\nresonance broadening was apparent (Fig. 3A). This stemmed from an enhancement in 15N R2\nrelaxation, as detected through measurements of different types of nuclear spin relaxation (Fig.\n3B). This was most pronounced for residues closest to the A3 acidic tract (residues 161-188),\nwhich mediates interactions with R-motif-containing proteins18 including Arf 2. Interestingly, R2\nenhancement was due in part to chemical exchange as measured by 15N Carr-Purcell-\nMeiboom-Gill (15N-CPMG) relaxation dispersion (Fig. 3C). Fitting to a 2-state exchange model\nshowed that interconversion of NPM1 IDR conformations occurred on the 100s \u00b5s timescale\n(Fig. 3C, Supplementary Fig. 9, Supplementary Table 6), suggesting that the condensate\nenvironment restrains conformational dynamics of the NPM1 IDR (Fig. 3D).\np14ARF hydrophobic residues contribute to p14ARF meso-scale ordering and to reduced\nNPM1 mobility within condensates\nWe hypothesized that the hydrophobic interfaces in the p14ARF N-terminal region are\ninvolved in interactions that drive phase separation and reduce NPM1 mobility within\ncondensates. To test this, we substituted multiple aliphatic residues (Ile, Leu, and Val) within the\np14ARF N-terminus with Gly and Ser (termed p14ARF\u0394H1-3) (Fig 4A, Supplementary Table 1).\nWe then performed titrations of p14ARF and p14ARF\u0394H1-3 into solutions of Alexa Fluor 488\nconjugated NPM1 (NPM1-AF488) and determined their respective thresholds for heterotypic\nphase separation (termed saturation concentration values, Csat) using confocal fluorescence\nmicroscopy (Fig. 4B, C). As expected, the Csat value for phase separation of p14ARF\u0394H1-3 with\nNPM1-AF488 was several-fold greater than that for p14ARF (Fig. 4B, C). CV-SANS analysis of\np14ARF\u0394H1-3-NPM1 condensates showed that substitution of the hydrophobic residues in\np14ARF abrogates meso-scale ordering of p14ARF molecules within the condensed phase with\nNPM1 (Fig. 4D).\nTo test whether elimination of the p14ARF hydrophobic interfaces enhanced NPM1\nmobility within condensates, we performed fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP)\nassays on p14ARF-NPM1-AF488 and p14ARF\u0394H1-3-NPM1-AF488 condensates (Fig. 4E-G;\nSupplementary Fig. 10, 11). Within condensates containing p14ARF\u0394H1-3, NPM1-AF488\nexhibited significantly greater mobility (Fig. 4F) and faster diffusion (based on apparent diffusion\nrates, DApp) (Fig. 4G) as compared to condensates containing p14ARF.\nTaken together, these results show that hydrophobic residues within the p14ARF-NTD act\nas \u201cstickers\u201d 35 that mediate self-association, enhance multivalent heterotypic interactions to\ndrive phase separation with NPM1, and promote meso-scale assembly of p14ARF molecules,\nthus restraining NPM1 translational diffusion.\np14ARF reduces nucleolar NPM1 diffusion in a concentration-dependent manner\nNPM1 sequesters p14ARF in nucleoli to inhibit it from engaging other binding partners\nand activating anti-proliferative pathways 4. Given that NPM1 usually forms dynamic, liquid-like\ncondensates 36 and purified p14ARF rapidly precipitates from solution37, we reasoned that p14ARF\nand NPM1 form condensates that block p14ARF aggregation by capturing it within the gel-like\ninteraction network of the meso-scale assemblies (Fig. 5A). This is akin to NPM1\u2019s role as a\nchaperone for misfolded proteins in the nucleolus during cellular stress 38. On the other hand,\noverexpression of p19Arf promotes NPM1 degradation 13 and assembly of high molecular weight\np19Arf-containing complexes 2. Based on these observations, we reasoned that an abundance of\nNPM1 is needed to form p14ARF-NPM1 complexes in nucleoli, to stabilize p14ARF and limit its\npotential for homo- and hetero-oligomerization with other nucleolar biomacromolecules.\nTherefore, we next asked whether expression of p14ARF alters the dynamics of NPM1 in\nnucleoli.\nWe addressed this question using the human DLD-1 colorectal adenocarcinoma cell\nline, which harbors transcriptionally inactive, mutant p53 (p53S241F) 39,40 and is effectively p14ARF-\nnull due to promotor hypermethylation 41. We performed CRISPR-Cas9 editing to insert the gene\nfor monomeric, enhanced green fluorescent protein (mEGFP) 42 at the 3\u2019-end of both alleles of\nthe NPM1 gene, leading to expression of C-terminally mEGFP-tagged NPM1 at endogenous\nlevels (NPM1-GFP; termed DLD-1NPM1-G cells) (Supplementary Table 1). Next, we performed\nlentiviral transduction of DLD-1NPM1-G cells to enable doxycycline-inducible expression of p14ARF\nfused at the C-terminus to the monomeric, near-infrared fluorescent protein, miRFP670 (p14ARF-\niRFP) 43. As expected, following doxycycline induction, p14ARF-iRFP localized to nucleoli with\nNPM1-GFP (Fig. 5B). High-throughput imaging of DLD-1NPM1-G nucleoli showed that nucleolar\nNPM1-GFP and p14ARF-iRFP levels were anti-correlated (Fig. 5C; Supplementary Figs. 12 and\n13A, B). We next performed FRAP of p14ARF-iRFP and NPM1-GFP in DLD-1NPM1-G cells (Fig.\n5D-F; Supplementary Figs. 10 and 13C-E). Consistent with our in vitro results, we observed a\nsubstantial reduction in DApp and mobility values for NPM1-GFP with increasing p14ARF-iRFP\nlevels (Fig. 5D-F, Supplementary Fig. 14). Similarly, DApp and mobility values for p14ARF-iRFP\nitself decreased as its levels increased (Fig. 5D-F, Supplementary Fig. 14). Together, these\nresults suggest that elevated p14ARF levels promote the formation of high molecular weight\np14ARF-NPM1 assemblies in nucleoli.\nTo assess the dependence of this effect on the level of p14ARF-iRFP expression, we first\nused flow cytometry to isolate DLD-1NPM1-G clones that expressed p14ARF-iRFP at different levels\n(Supplementary Fig. 15A). Consistent with our observations with unsorted DLD-1NPM1-G cells,\nexpression of p14ARF-iRFP in the isolated DLD-1NPM1-G clones caused dose-dependent\nreductions in DApp and mobility for NPM1-GFP, which was correlated with values for p14ARF-\niRFP (Supplementary Fig. 15B, C). We then monitored p14ARF-iRFP and NPM1-GFP diffusion\nfor two clones (termed G2 and B11) before, and 24 hours and 48 hours after doxycycline\ninduction of p14ARF-iRFP expression. Both DLD-1NPM1-G clones showed significant reductions in\nthe DApp value for p14ARF-iRFP and NPM1-GFP within 24 hours, which persisted after 48 hours\nof p14ARF-iRFP expression (Supplementary Fig. 15D, E). Furthermore, NPM1-GFP mobility was\nreduced in both DLD-1NPM1-G cell clones at the 48-hour time point (Supplementary Fig. 15F, G).\nConsistent with previous reports of p14ARF expression in p53-null cell lines 6,44, expression of\np14ARF-iRFP correlated with reduced viability of DLD-1NPM1-G cells in a dose- and time-\ndependent manner (Supplementary Fig. 15H, I).\nWe hypothesized that the reductions in diffusion for p14ARF-iRFP and NPM1-GFP are\ndependent on hydrophobic residues within p14ARF\u2019s N-terminal \u03b2-strands and \u03b1-helix and tested\nthis by expressing miRFP670-tagged p14ARF\u0394H1-3 (p14ARF\u0394H1-3-iRFP) in DLD-1NPM1-G cells\n(Supplementary Fig. 16A). Using high-throughput imaging, we did not observe a reduction in\nnucleolar NPM1 levels with increasing p14ARF\u0394H1-3-iRFP levels (Supplementary Fig. 16B, C).\nWe next performed FRAP of p14ARF \u0394H1-3-iRFP and NPM1-GFP in DLD-1NPM1-G cells and\nobserved no apparent reduction in diffusion rate or mobility for p14ARF\u0394H1-3-iRFP or NPM1-\nGFP with increasing p14ARF \u0394H1-3-iRFP levels (Supplementary Fig. 16D, E). We further used\nsingle-cell sorting to identify DLD-1NPM1-G clones that expressed p14ARF\u0394H1-3-iRFP at varied\nlevels (Supplementary Fig. 16F). We next performed FRAP assays to monitor p14ARF\u0394H1-3-\niRFP and NPM1-GFP diffusion over the course of two days, for clones C10 and H5, which\nexpressed p14ARF\u0394H1-3-iRFP levels comparable to p14ARF-iRFP in clones G2 and B11. In\ncontrast to results with wild-type p14ARF-iRFP, for clones C10 and H5, DApp values for NPM1-\nGFP remained relatively constant after induced expression of p14ARF\u0394H1-3-iRFP\n(Supplementary Fig. 16G, H), reduced NPM1-GFP mobility was not observed (Supplementary\nFig. 16I, J), and importantly, cell proliferation was not reduced (Supplementary Fig. 16K, L).\nIndeed, during enforced expression of p14ARF\u0394H1-3-iRFP, DLD-1NPM1-G cells proliferated to the\nsame extent as during expression of miRFP670 (iRFP) alone (Supplementary Fig. 16M).\nHowever, nucleolar partitioning of p14ARF\u0394H1-3-iRFP was reduced relative to that of p14ARF-\niRFP (Supplementary Fig. 16N). Thus, in agreement with our observations of in vitro p14ARF-\nNPM1 condensates, hydrophobic residues within the p14ARF-NTD enhance nucleolar partitioning\nand mediate interactions in nucleoli that restrain p14ARF-iRFP and NPM1-GFP diffusion."

            "text": "p14ARF is a highly basic intrinsically disordered protein that functions as a tumor\nsuppressor through p53-dependent and -independent mechanisms45. Here, we probed the\nstructural features of p14ARF in condensates with NPM1 and within nucleoli in DLD-1 cells\nlacking functional p53 and endogenous p14ARF. Strikingly, p14ARF adopts elements of secondary\nstructure and induces meso-scale ordering upon phase separation to form gel-like condensates\nwith NPM1. In addition to the R-motifs, which mediate electrostatic interactions with multivalent\nacidic tracts within pentameric NPM1\u2019s central IDR 2,16,18, hydrophobic residues within p14ARF\nmediate homotypic interactions that underlie meso-scale ordering. The extended nature of\np14ARF creates voids within the meso-scale assembly that are compatible with the dimensions of\npentameric NPM1, the IDR of which remains flexible despite mediating key interactions with\np14ARF. Formation of this meso-scale assembly significantly attenuates the mobility of p14ARF\nand NPM1 within condensates in comparison with their dynamic states in condensates formed\nby NPM1 and the hydrophobic residue-depleted p14ARF mutant (p14ARF\u0394H1-3). While it is\nimpossible to probe the meso-scale structure of p14ARF and NPM1 within nucleoli using SANS\nand ssNMR, we did probe the dynamics of these proteins within cells, which revealed\nunexpected functional interplay. The mobility of p14ARF declined as its level within nucleoli\nincreased and this was paralleled by p14ARF level-dependent declines in NPM1 mobility. Further,\nthe levels of p14ARF and NPM1 within nucleoli were anti-correlated, suggesting that\nmulticomponent phase separation46 underlies the functional relationship between these two\nproteins within nucleoli. This functional interplay was eliminated through mutation of\nhydrophobic residues of p14ARF. Cell viability tracked downwards with increased p14ARF\nexpression levels, suggesting that p14ARF serves as a viability rheostat through multicomponent\nphase separation with NPM1 and likely other nucleolar components. Our results provide\nmechanistic insight into how NPM1 stabilizes Arf within nucleoli 5,6, consistent with NPM1\u2019s role\nas a nucleolar chaperone upon protein unfolding stress 38. However, we also show that, as its\nlevels rise, p14ARF intoxicates cells, consistent with its tumor suppressor activity in response to\noncogene activation47.\nMany intrinsically disordered proteins, or intrinsically disordered protein regions, adopt\ncompact conformations in isolation under physiological conditions but some assume more\nexpanded conformations after a phase transition 35,48. Conformational expansion exposes so-\ncalled sticker residues within polypeptide chains for multivalent interactions that underlie\nintermolecular network formation and phase separation 35. Crosslinks may also be mediated by\nfolded segments within stretches of otherwise disordered regions. For example, FG nucleoporin\nhydrogels are scaffolded by intermolecular \u03b2-sheet interactions 49, and TDP-43 C-terminal\ndomain phase separation requires transient contacts between a conserved \u03b1-helix 50. Here we\nshow that p14ARF populates an ensemble of extended conformations with elements of \u03b2-strand\nand \u03b1-helical secondary structure within meso-scale assemblies with NPM1. Interestingly,\nsimilar binding-induced induction of secondary structure, albeit without a phase transition, was\npreviously observed with fragments of both p14ARF and p19Arf containing conserved R-motifs\nthat form soluble, -strand-rich structures upon binding to acidic-residue-rich stretches derived\nfrom the central IDR of HDM2 51-54. We propose that adoption of secondary structure within Arf\nis a common mechanism underlying its interactions with acid-tract-containing binding partners."

The posterior was then used as a new prior and equation (1) was evaluated for 15,000 iterations to improve the estimate of the weight vector. Convergence was assessed by evaluating the ensemble average scaling factor over the refinement trajectory (Supplementary Fig. 8A, B). 160 of the most probable conformers were selected from each starting pool and a rank sums test, as implemented in the scipy statistical functions submodule, was performed to determine the most probable refined ensemble, and identify degenerate ensembles (Supplementary Fig. 8C).\nD+ 34 was used to assemble the conformers from the refined ensemble into configurations of various sizes and space groups and compute their scattering intensities. Initially, p14ARF conformers were assembled into 2D square and rectangular space groups. For each space group, array sizes ranging from 2x2 to 4x4 were assembled with X, Y interchain distances ranging from 160-200\u00c5 in 10\u00c5 increments. The reciprocal grid size was then calculated using the \u201csuggest parameters\u201d tool and scattering curves were computed using the classic Monte-Carlo integration method with 1e6 iterations and a 500ms update interval. The best model was determined based on the smallest chi-squared difference between the ensemble average scattering curves from a given configuration and the experimental CV-SANS curve.\nCellular Imaging\nFluorescence microscopy imaging for analysis of live DLD-1NPM1-G cell nucleoli was performed on a Zeiss LSM 980 Airyscan 2 inverted microscope, with a 40x Plan Apochromat (N.A. 1.1) objective (mEGFP lex = 492 nm, miRFP670 lex = 653 nm; lem = 300-720 nm). Highthroughput fluorescence imaging of virally transduced DLD-1NPM1-G clones and FRAP experiments were performed using a 3i Marianas spinning disk confocal microscopes (Intelligent Imaging Innovations Inc., Denver, CO, USA) with a 40x air objective and 100x oil immersion objective (N.A. 1.4), respectively.

Image segmentation was performed using an in-house pipeline written in Python (Supplementary Fig. 12). Segmentation of nuclei and nucleoli were performed using the NPM1 signal; NPM1-GFP fluorescence was used for segmenting live DLD-1NPM1-G cell images. 3D image stacks were first converted to 2D images through maximum intensity projection. Prior to segmentation of nuclei, the Gaussian kernel with variable standard deviation (\u03c3) from scikit-image was first applied (for Airyscan DLD-1NPM1-G cell images \u03c3=4).\nPrior to segmentation of nucleoli, a Gaussian kernel with \u03c3=0.33 was applied. Segmentation was performed using the multi-Otzu algorithm from scikit-image using 3 classes as input. Nuclear masks were found at the 0th threshold and nucleolar masks were found at the 1st threshold. Masked pixels were then clustered using the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm as implemented in scikit-learn. Segmented cells along with their nuclear and nucleolar masks were visualized using the imshow function from\nmatplotlib. All segmented cell masks were verified by manual observation and improperly segmented cells were removed prior to quantification.\nTo quantify the extent of recombinant p14ARF-NPM1 phase separation the index of dispersion (IOD) was calculated for >5 imaging areas: \ud835\udc3c\ud835\udc42\ud835\udc37 = \ud835\udf0e2\ud835\udf07\n(20) where, \ud835\udf0e2 is the variance and \ud835\udf07 is the mean fluorescence intensity."
