    "abstractText": "This work demonstrates a facile one-pot method for preparing graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) quantum dots/graphene hydrogel (CNQ/GH) nanocomposites using a hydrothermal process, in which graphene sheets of a graphene hydrogel (GH) are decorated with g-C3N4 quantum dots (CNQDs) and have a 3D hierarchical and interconnected structure through a typical self-assembly process. The obtained CNQ/ GH nanocomposite demonstrates improved electrochemical performances of a supercapacitor with a specific capacitance of 243.2 F g 1 at a current density of 0.2 A g . In addition, the fabricated symmetric supercapacitor (SSC) using CNQ/GH electrodes exhibits a high energy density of 22.5 W h kg 1 at a power density of 250 W kg 1 and a superior cycling stability with a capacitance retention of 89.5% after 15 000 cycles. The observed improvements in the electrochemical performance of CNQ/GH electrodes are attributed to the large surface area with abundant mesopores and various C\u2013N bonds in CNQDs, which promote efficient ion diffusion of electrolyte and electron transfer and provide more active sites for faradaic reactions. These obtained results demonstrate a facile and efficient route to develop potential electrode materials for high-performance energy storage device applications.",

            "text": "Supercapacitors have received great attention as one of the efficient energy storage devices for powering electronics due to their high power capability, long cycling stability and low maintenance costs.1\u20133 Based on the charge storage mechanism, supercapacitors can be classied as electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) and pseudocapacitors. Various electrode materials such as activated carbon, carbon nanotubes, and graphene have been studied extensively for use in EDLCs.4\u201310 Among them, graphene as a two-dimensional monolayer of sp2hybridized carbon atoms is attracting constant attention due to its outstanding features such as large surface area, high electrical conductivity, and good durability.11\u201313 In particular, graphene hydrogel (GH) is a three-dimensional (3D) porous network of graphene sheets that is considered as a potential active material for supercapacitors because of its high porosity, large specic surface area and high electrical conductivity.14\u201316 The highly porous structure of GH facilitates electrolyte penetration, thereby exposing most graphene sheets to the electrolyte. However, the non-faradaic charge storage mechanism in these graphene-based materials causes limited specic capacitance.\nof Ulsan, 93 Daehak-ro Nam-gu, Ulsan @ulsan.ac.kr\ntion (ESI) available. See DOI:\nthe Royal Society of Chemistry\nGraphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4) is another suitable active material for use in supercapacitors in virtue of its chemical stability, nitrogen-rich framework, environmental-friendly characteristics, and mild synthesis conditions.17\u201323 Among these features, high N content of g-C3N4 can provides active sites for faradaic reactions and increases the surface polarity to enhance wettability to electrolyte and mass transfer efficiency, resulting in improved electrochemical performance. In particular, the incorporation of pyrrolic and pyridinic N group in gC3N4 can be favorable for improving the pseudocapacitance.24,25 In this regard, g-C3N4 quantum dots (CNQDs), a novel zerodimensional g-C3N4 with ultrasmall size less than 10 nm, can be used as supercapacitor electrodes, which is ascribed to abundant surface functional groups of CNQDs for access of electrolyte ions and large surface area for efficient ion transportation of electrode.26 In addition, the well-developed nanostructures and abundant active sites by high N content could lead to achieve enhanced electrochemical performances. However, there are few reports on the use of CNQDs as electrodes for supercapacitors.26\nHerein, we report a facile one-pot preparation route of CNQDs decorated GH nanocomposites (denoted as CNQ/GH) for the electrode materials of symmetric supercapacitors. The hydrothermal reaction was carried out using graphene oxide (GO) and CNQDs mixture solution to obtain CNQ/GH nanocomposites, showing a 3D hierarchical and interconnected structure of graphene sheets decorated with CNQDs.

In addition, the assembled symmetric supercapacitor using CNQ/ GH electrodes showed a high energy density and good cycling stability."

            "text": "The schematic of the synthesis of CNQ/GH nanocomposites is illustrated in Fig. 1, where one-pot hydrothermal reaction of the mixture solution of GO and CNQDs was carried out to form CNQDs embedded GH composites. The photograph in Fig. 1 shows a cylindrical sample of the as-prepared CNQ/GH nanocomposite. During the hydrothermal process, GO sheets were stacked and self-assembled into a 3D interconnected hydrogel network with abundant macropores and mesopores. In addition, CNQDs were simultaneously deposited on GO sheets by the p\u2013p interaction on fabricating GH. The surface morphology of CNQ/GH nanocomposite was examined using SEM. As seen in Fig. 2a and b, CNQ/GH nanocomposite exhibits a macroporous morphology with an interconnected 3D network of stacked graphene layers, where abundant well-dened hierarchical macropores and mesopores were observed. In a comparison, CNQ/GH composites possess a similar porous morphology of GH obtained without CNQDs (Fig. S1\u2020). The EDS elemental mapping images in Fig. 2c show a uniform distribution of C, O, and N atoms in the CNQ/GH nanocomposite. The morphology of the CNQ/GH composite was further examined using TEM measurement. It can be seen that CNQDs are embedded in wrinkled graphene sheets (Fig. 2d and e). The HRTEM image of CNQDs on graphene (Fig. 2f) presents an obvious lattice fringe of 0.336 nm corresponding to (002) facet of g-C3N4 with a diameter of approximately 3 nm. These results indicate the successful decoration of CNQDs on GH by the one-pot hydrothermal process. Furthermore, the porous structure of GH and CNQ/GH composite was investigated using N2 adsorption\u2013 desorption isotherms as shown in Fig. S2.\u2020 The N2 adsorption isotherms of GH and CNQ/GH show distinct hysteresis loops with a wide pore size distribution, which indicates mesoporous structures. The CNQ/GH nanocomposite has a large specic surface area of 627 m2 g 1, which is slightly smaller than that of GH (660m2 g 1) due to the deposition of CNQDs on the GH. The large surface area and abundant mesopores of CNQ/GH nanocomposite may hold promise for facilitating efficient electrolyte access and electron transfer for enhanced electrochemical performance.\nAs shown in Fig. 3a, the XRD pattern of GH shows an intense peak at 2q \u00bc 25 and a small peak at 2q \u00bc 43 , corresponding to the (002) and (100) planes of graphite, respectively. In contrast to GH, aer fabrication of CNQ/GH nanocomposites, both\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\npeaks of (002) and (100) planes become broader and less intense with increasing CNQDs content. The observed change is attributed to the unordered stacking of graphene sheets of GH due to the incorporation of CNQDs 11. Thus, CNQDs can be effectively embedded onto graphene sheets by the p\u2013p interactions between them, which prevent the restacking of graphene sheets during the hydrothermal process, resulting in peak broadening and weakening of the peak intensity of GH. Fig. 3b presents FTIR spectra of the prepared GH and CNQ/GH nanocomposites. All samples exhibit peaks centered at 1217, 1400, and 1720 cm 1 corresponding to the stretching vibrations of C\u2013C, C\u2013O\u2013H, and C]O, respectively. In addition, it is worth mentioning that the CNQ/GH nanocomposites exhibit a distinct new peak centered at 1580 cm 1, belonging to the typical stretching vibrations of the C]N band, which is not observed in GH. In addition, Raman spectrum (Fig. S3\u2020) exhibit that the Id/Ig ratio of graphene increased gradually as the addition of CNQDs. These results suggest that CNQDs are well embedded on graphene sheets to form CNQ/GH nanocomposites.\nFor further analysis of the surface chemical composition of the CNQ/GH nanocomposite, XPS measurements were performed, and Fig. 4a shows the XPS survey spectra of GH and CNQ/GH nanocomposite. The peaks of C atoms are observed for both samples, whereas the peaks of N are recorded only for CNQ/GH nanocomposite, indicating the presence of CNQDs. In Fig. 4b, the deconvolution of C 1s spectrum for GH exhibits different carbon-containing groups centered at 284.7, 285.3, 286.3, and 288.8 eV, assigning to C\u2013C/C]C in graphene plane, C\u2013OH, C\u2013O and O\u2013C]O bonds, respectively.29 In comparison to GH, new peaks were observed in the C 1s spectrum of CNQ/GH composite as seen in Fig. 4c, which are centered at 286.3 and 287.4 eV corresponding to C\u2013N/C\u2013O and C]N bonds from CNQDs. Deconvolution of the N 1s spectrum of CNQ/GH reveals three peaks centered at 399.6, 401.1, and 402.7 eV, attributing to pyridinic N, pyrrolic N, and graphitic N, respectively. Of these three nitrogen congurations, pyridinic N and pyrrolic N are expected to contribute to pseudocapacitance through Faraday reactions, whereas graphitic N is considered to increase the conductivity of materials, which could improve the capacitive performance.30,31 In addition, N in CNQDs can lead the change of electron distribution of graphene, which can improve wettability of electrolyte, resulting in an increase in the accessible surface area to the electrolyte.\nia hydrothermal process.\nRSC Adv., 2022, 12, 3561\u20133568 | 3563\nFig. 2 (a and b) SEM images of CNQ/GH composite and (c) its EDS elemental mapping images.

Cyclic voltammetry (CV), galvanostatic charge/discharge (GCD), and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) tests were performed using a three-electrode system in a 6 M aqueous KOH electrolyte. Fig. 5a shows the CV curves of GH and different CNQ/GH electrode obtained at a scan rate of 5 mV s 1 over a potential varying from 0.2 to 0.8 V. The CV curves have a distorted rectangular shape for CNQ/GH electrodes, suggesting the electric double layer capacitance and limited pseudocapacitance due to the existence of the CNQDs. It also reveals that the CNQ/GH electrodes exhibit signicantly improved capacitive behavior over the GH electrode. The GCD curves of GH and different CNQ/GH electrodes at a current density of 0.2 A g 1 are shown in Fig. 5b. The CNQ3/GH nanocomposite shows a much higher specic capacitance, calculated to be 243.2 F g 1 compared to GH (53.1 F g 1), conrming the benecial synergistic effect between CNQDs and GH, which is consistent with the obtained CV results. Fig. 5c presents the CV curves of the CNQ3/GH electrode at different scan rates. The current responses of the CNQ3/GH electrode increase with increasing scan rate, and the CV curves deviate from a distorted rectangular shape to spindle shape at a high scan rate. The GCD curves of the CNQ3/GH electrode were obtained at different current densities, as shown in Fig. 5d. It is found that the specic capacitance decreases with increasing current density due to limited diffusion and transfer of ions as the current density increases. The specic capacitances of the CNQ3/GH electrode were determined to be 243.2 and 201.6 F g 1 at current densities of 0.2 and 1.5 A g 1, respectively, which suggests that 83% of its specic capacitance is retained with increasing current density.

It is worth noting that these capacitive performances of the CNQ/GH electrode are substantially higher than or comparable to those of previously reported GH-based electrodes (Table S1\u2020). To further understand the electrochemical kinetics of the CNQ/ GH electrode, EIS measurements were carried out over a frequency range from 10 kHz to 0.01 Hz in a 6 M KOH electrolyte. Fig. 5f shows the Nyquist plots of GH and CNQ/GH electrodes with an equivalent circuit, where Rs represents the intrinsic internal resistance in series of the electrochemical system, Rct is the charge-transfer resistance at the electrode\u2013 electrolyte contact interface, and Zw is the Warburg impedance for the diffusion of electrolyte ion in the bulk of electrode. The semicircular diameter lying in high frequency region denotes Rct, in which smaller semicircles of CNQ/GH electrodes reveals higher electrical conductivity than that of GH electrode. The higher slopes of the straight lines in the low-frequency region for the CNQ/GH electrodes also demonstrate a faster ion transfer rates between electrode and electrolyte than that of GH electrode. The CNQ3/GH shows the smallest semicircle diameter and the highest slope of the straight line, which is consistent with the above-mentioned electrochemical performances results. The introduction of CNQDs to GH can not only improve the electrochemical performance but also enhance the cycle stability due to the uniform and homogeneous distribution of CNQDs on the GH surface. However, for the higher amount of CNQDs than CNQ3/GH, the sacrice of contact area between GH and the electrolyte will happen that leads to a negative effect on the electrode performance. These results imply that the CNQ/GH electrode has enhanced charge-transfer characteristics with fast ion transport and electrolyte diffusion, resulting in\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nimproved electrochemical performance due to the benecial synergistic effect between CNQDs and GH.\nTo better evaluate the practical performance of CNQ/GH electrodes, all-solid-state symmetric supercapacitors (SSC) were fabricated using two CNQ/GH electrodes as cathode and anode with PVA/KOH gel electrolyte. Fig. 6a shows CV curves of as-fabricated SSC using CNQ/GH electrodes at different scan rates of 5\u2013100 mV s 1 with a potential window from 0 to 1.0 V. The CV curves retain a distorted rectangular shape without distinct distortion with increasing scan rates, which indicates the excellent rate capability of the CNQ/GH electrode. The GCD curves of the SSC device using CNQ/GH electrodes at different current densities are shown in Fig. 6b. The estimated specic capacitance is 162.3 F g 1 at a current density of 0.5 A g 1. To further evaluate the exibility of as-prepared SSC with CNQ/GH electrodes, the CV curves were collected under different bending angles at a scan rate of 50 mV s 1 (Fig. 6c). The CV shapes were well retained even at a 180 bending angle, which demonstrates good mechanical stability of the SSC with CNQ/ GH electrodes. The energy density and power density are considered important parameters for evaluating the electrochemical performance of supercapacitors. The Ragone plots of the SSC with CNQ/GH electrodes are shown in Fig. 6d with the results of previously reported graphene-based SSCs. It is obviously observed that the SSC fabricated with CNQ/GH electrode delivers a high energy density of 22.5 W h kg 1 at a power density of 250 W kg 1 and retains 4.6 W h kg 1 at a high power density of 2500 W kg 1. These performances are superior to those of other reported electrodes including N,S co-doped GH (6.25 W h kg 1 at a power density of 500W kg 1),32 N,S co-doped graphene (8.3 W h kg 1 at a power density of 510 W kg 1),33 N,S co-doped carbon spheres (18.1 W h kg 1 at a power density of\nRSC Adv., 2022, 12, 3561\u20133568 | 3565\nFig. 6 (a) CV curves of the SSC device using CNQ3/GH electrodes at various scan rates from 5 to 100 mV s 1 (inset is the photograph of device).

The GCD curves of the SSC with CNQ/GH electrodes from 1st to 5th cycle and from the 14 995th to 15 000th cycles are shown in the inset of Fig. 6e, where only slight change in the GCD curves is observed. The cycle stability still retains 89.5% of the initial capacitance aer 15 000 cycles, indicating its excellent long-term cycling stability. Furthermore, two SSC devices with CNQ/GH electrodes connected in series can power a commercial red light-emitting diode (LED), showing its potential for practical applications (Fig. 6f). These excellent capacitive performances of CNQ/GH electrodes are attributed to the highly porous structure of the electrodes and the synergistic effect of CNQDs and GH nanocomposites. The large surface area and mesoporosity of the CNQ/GH electrode provide effective contact between the electrode and the electrolyte and a short diffusion distance, which facilitates fast ion diffusion of electrode. In addition, the various C\u2013N bonds in CNQDs can serve as active sites for pseudocapacitance through faradaic reactions with increased electrical conductivity and better wettability of electrolyte."
