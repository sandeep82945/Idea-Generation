    "abstractText": "This study uses the method of bibliometrics to sort out and analyze the Chinese research on service innovation in the past ten years, and uses Citespace software to conduct basic statistics and keyword analysis on 1 048 literature samples screened in the CNKI database. The research shows that the number of service innovation literature has increased significantly since 2012, and it follows the development law of service innovation connotation, influencing factors, and innovation paths, and maintains a relatively stable number. From the overall situation, the core author group is not large, there is less cooperation between cross-institutional authors, and most of the publishing institutions are more cooperation between universities located in developed areas of the service industry, but the industry-university research is insufficient of publications. The results continue to extend to the fields of Information technology innovation, business model innovation and management innovation.",

Since then, the central and local governments have introduced a series of policies and measures to encourage service innovation. For example, in July 2021, the General Office of the State Council issued the \u201cOpinions on Accelerating the Development of New Formats and Models of Foreign Trade\u201d, aiming to promote service innovation, format innovation, model innovation, etc. In the field of foreign trade; various localities have also implemented national and regarding the spirit of innovation and development of the service industry, the province has issued policies related to the innovation and development of the service industry. Most of these policies are based on knowledge innovation, and aim to focus on the development of industries such as logistics, finance, and business services, promote industrial innovation and integration, strengthen industrial development carriers, and enhance industrial development momentum. Starting from 2020, China will carry out the pilot work of comprehensively deepening the innovation and development of service trade.\n1 Corresponding Author, Jing SUN, Beijing Wuzi University, China; Email: cnbjsj@126.com Supported by Beijing Social Science Foundation Project \u201cResearch on the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei Synergy Mechanism in the Construction of the Grand Canal National Cultural Park\u201d (Grant No.21GLC060); University-level Scientific Research Project of Beijing Wuzi University \u201cResearch on the Development of Beijing Grand Canal Cultural Tourism Industry\u201d (Grant No.2021XJKY06)\nAs the end of August 2022, the implementation rate of 122 specific measures proposed in the overall pilot plan exceeds 90%. All departments resolutely implement the deployment of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, the pilot tasks have been fully implemented to further improve China's service innovation level.\nService innovation is the result of the fusion of two research fields, service research and innovation research. For a long time, the manufacturing industry has been the main driving force of the economy, the concept of innovation is often equated with technological innovation, and innovation research is also mainly centered on products. In the 1970s, the output of the service industry in many Western countries gradually exceeded Be productive, but still not considered innovative. During this period, some new services began to appear in the fields of civil aviation, television, distance education, and computer software, but most of them depended on new materialized products and were not regarded as service innovations by the theoretical circles. The \u201cindustrialization\u201d of services emphasized by Levitt is to systematize the division of labor and standardize service products through organizational innovation. Just as the division of labor and organizational innovation in manufacturing firms paved the way for technological innovation, the service sector may also be able to develop a more sustainable model of innovation. After the 1980s, with the further development of the service industry, many studies on the service industry were carried out in Europe and the United States, but their orientation was still centered on major technological changes, and many of these studies were related to innovation. After the 1990s, researchers gradually realized that service innovation is an important but neglected field. In 1998, Vandermerwe and Rada first proposed the concept of service innovation[1] . Service innovation in this paper refers to the transformation of serviceoriented enterprises into new or improved service methods through new ideas and new technical means.\nThe research in the field of service innovation in China has been started since the reform and opening up. With the rapid development of the service industry, the research on service innovation has gradually deepened. Before 2012, Zhang Huiwen analyzed the existing research on service innovation in China, and found that China has formed a certain system in this research field, with relatively systematic research results. Lin Lei and Wu Guisheng have systematically introduced the development process of the concept of service innovation in 2003, and further explained the research methods of service innovation and the four-dimensional model of service innovation. Chen Jin and Chen Yufen systematically analyzed the classification, characteristics, models and other aspects of service innovation. In 2004, Jin Zhouying and Ren Lin systematically summarized the development history of the service economy and the development trend of the modern service industry, and for the first time described service as an important soft technology, and proposed a service innovation system and innovation approaches with soft technology innovation as the core.[2]Through the joint development of practice and theory, in 2012, the added value of China's service industry began to exceed the secondary industry, and the development of China's service industry continued to reach a new level.\nSince then, as China continues to promote the innovation capabilities of the\nservice industry, stimulate new kinetic energy in services, and encourage high-quality development of the service industry, the variety of services is becoming more and more abundant. The literature on service innovation research in academia has also increased year by year, and the topics involved are characterized by diversification and\nintersection. and new formats and models have emerged. The theory has begun to solve some problems in practice.\nFrom the research in this period, we can find the research hotspots in the field of\nservice innovation in China. However, in addition to case studies and other application studies, most theoretical studies in this period focus on qualitative analysis of specific topics, but almost no quantitative analysis and content analysis of literature from a macro perspective. On the basis of analyzing the content of existing research literature on service innovation, this study uses bibliometrics methods and Citespace tools to select the literature from 2012 to 2021, conduct visual research on the trend of literature and the author cooperation network of service innovation literature, and understand the basic situation of the literature. Through the cluster analysis of literature keywords, this paper analyzes the research hot topics in the field of service innovation and puts forward the future research directions of service innovation."

Figure 1 shows the annual number of published papers in the field of service innovation in the past ten years.\nThe number of papers related to service innovation turned a corner in 2015,\nshowing a steady upward trend before 2015, and a downward trend after 2015.\nIn June 2017, China released the Outline of Innovative Development of the\nService Industry (2017-2025), which pointed out the new direction of the development of the service industry and the current research focus for scholars. Therefore, the number of documents issued after 2017 has a tendency to rise slightly.\nHowever, after 2020, the number of papers drop rapidly, especially in 2021, the\nnumber of papers is only 53. The reason for this phenomenon has something to do with the outbreak of the COVID-19. The epidemic has led to dramatic changes in the international situation. As a result, China has begun to focus on the core technology of the manufacturing industry, paying more attention to the research field of manufacturing technology innovation. At the same time, with the development of information technology, the meta universe has attracted wide attention. New technologies, such as Web3.0, VR/AR, blockchain technology, 5G, artificial intelligence and so on, have developed rapidly but are not yet mature. Therefore, the main research on these emerging things is still developing at the technical level and has not yet reached the research service level. With the latest progress in the research of these technologies, they will be applied to enterprise services, bringing a lot of innovation opportunities to the service industry. It can be predicted that the research on service innovation will increase significantly in the future."

            "text": "In bibliometrics, core authors refer to those who can conduct continuous research in a certain research field and have a certain impact on research in this field. The number of papers published by authors in the field of service innovation can reflect their influence to a certain extent. According to Price's Law, it is the number of papers published by all authors; is the minimum number of papers published by core authors.\nIn the literature data of this article, the number of papers published by the same\nauthor is 16, that is = 16. According to Price's Law, . Therefore, authors who have published 3 papers or more are the influential authors in the field of service innovation. According to the statistics of Citespace software, the core authors include Wei Jiang, Jian Zhaoquan, Wang Lin and so on, a total of 36 people.\nBy running the Citespace software and setting the node type to author, we can\nobtain the visual map of the authors in the study in Figure 2. The larger the author's name in the figure, the more publications. The link between the nodes indicates that there is a cooperative relationship between the authors.[6]\nAccording to Figure 2, it can be seen that Wei Jiang, Jian Zhaoquan, and Peng\nBenhong have relatively large names, indicating that they have published more papers in the field of service innovation. In the cooperation network, it can be seen that the cooperation of authors in the field of service innovation research is relatively scattered, and the more obvious cooperation network is circled by the black dotted line in the figure. These influential authors, Wei Jiang, Jian Zhaoquan and Wang Lin, have collaborated a lot of high-quality research.\nIn order to examine the cooperation between different institutions and find out the\ncore academic groups and institutions in the field of service innovation research, this paper analyzes the institutional cooperation through Citespace software. Set the node type to institution, and at the same time, in order to see the cooperative relationship more clearly, the threshold is adjusted to 8, and the cooperation map of the research institution in Figure is generated. The node in the figure is the name of the organization, the size of the node represents the amount of published documents, the node ring represents the annual ring, and the size of the label font represents the centrality. There are 1 026 nodes and 701 connections in the institutional cooperation network, and the network density is 0.001 3.\nIt can be seen from the figure3 that the institutions are mainly concentrated in the School of Economics and Management or the School of Business, indicating that the research in the field of service innovation is mainly concentrated in the field of economy and management. The large nodes, such as South China University of Technology, Zhejiang University and Nanjing University, are all high-ranked universities in China, with high academic level, so they have published many valuable papers, which also shows that universities are the main institutions of service innovation research, but almost none of them cooperate with enterprises, which means that the research on service innovation lacks industry-university research.\nFrom the perspective of the location of research institutions, the research in the\nfield of service innovation is mainly concentrated in China's economically developed cities, such as Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Nanjing, Tianjin, Wuhan and Beijing, where the service industry is relatively mature and the level of service innovation is relatively high, indicating that the research of scholars is related to the degree of development of the service industry in their location.\n4.

            "text": "Keywords are the epitome of research content and a high-level summary of the paper. High-frequency keywords can reveal research hot topics and main directions in a certain field. This study analyzes the keywords of 1 048 documents, and filters out keywords that have no research value, such as \u201cinnovation\u201d, \u201centrepreneurship\u201d, \u201csystem\u201d, \u201cChina\u201d, \u201centerprise\u201d, \u201cInnovation and Entrepreneurship\u201d, then got 1 205\nkeywords. Next, used the LLR algorithm to cluster and analyze keywords, and is used to obtain the keyword clustering diagram in Figure 4. The Q value in the clustering map generated by Citespace software is 0.601 2 and is greater than 0.3, which means the structure is significant. The S value is 0.874 4 and is greater than 0.7, which means the clustering is highly efficient and convincing.\nIt can be seen from the figure 4 that a total of 7 cluster groups have been formed, #0 service innovation, #1 manufacturing enterprise,#2 technological innovation,#3 service outsourcing, #4 value co-creation, #5 industrial cluster, #6 Internet+.\nIn the \u201ccluster\u201d menu bar of Citespace software, and get the cluster table of service innovation keywords in Figure 5. From Figure 5, it can be seen that the \u201cservice innovation\u201d cluster contains the largest number of nodes, with a total of 41 nodes; followed by \u201cmanufacturing enterprises\u201d with a total of 36 nodes, indicating that the study of service innovation research and manufacturing enterprises have the most literature. In terms of closeness, the closest cluster is \u201cmanufacturing enterprises\u201d, which means the research on \u201cmanufacturing enterprises\u201d is relatively concentrated. By reading the literature under each cluster, and analyzing each cluster, the hot topics in the field of service innovation research from the past ten years can be found.\nBecause the subject of sample selection in CNKI database search is service innovation, the cluster #0 is relatively broad, so the content of this cluster has no great research value and will not be analyzed in detail here.\n4.1.1. Manufacturing enterprises\nThe keywords extracted from cluster #1 \u201cmanufacturing enterprises\u201d are manufacturing enterprises, product innovation, service-oriented transformation, and value migration. Most of the research content of this cluster is the influencing factors of service-oriented transformation of manufacturing enterprises, and the impact and realization of enterprise performance. There are many empirical studies and case studies in the research methods of this clustering.\nIn the research on the influencing factors of service-oriented transformation, Xiao Ting found that the characteristics of the management team, the size of the manufacturing enterprise, the craftsmanship and complexity of the enterprise's products, and the enterprise's innovation ability have an impact on the degree of service-oriented transformation.[7] Qu Wan et al. found that factors such as service innovation, customer demand, technological progress and macro environment play an important role in promoting the service-oriented transformation process of manufacturing enterprises.[8]\nIn the research on the relationship between manufacturing service-oriented transformation and enterprise performance, different scholars have different views. Jiang Zhu et al believe that service innovation has a significant positive impact on manufacturing service-oriented transformation.[9] Chen Juhong et al. found the impact of product-oriented service-oriented strategies on enterprise performance has a significant positive impact on enterprise performance, while the impact of customeroriented service-oriented strategies on enterprise performance is U type curve relationship [10]\nIn the research on the service innovation path and action mechanism of\nmanufacturing enterprises, Wei Jiang et al. initially constructed a research framework for the service innovation strategy of manufacturing enterprises based on the three influencing factors of knowledge resources, external environment and enterprise characteristics, in order to reveal that manufacturing enterprises use service innovation strategies through service innovation. Mechanisms for gaining a competitive advantage.[11] Yang Yang found that service innovation can significantly promote the service value of enterprises, and the effect of employee satisfaction on the relationship between the two (mainly between incremental innovation and enterprise performance) has a significant regulatory effect.[12]\n4.1.2. Technological Innovation\nThe keywords extracted from cluster #2 \u201ctechnological innovation\u201d are technological innovation, service-oriented, service innovation, patent information service, etc. This cluster has overlaps with other clusters, and has a high overlap with the technological innovation of manufacturing service-oriented transformation and service outsourcing to the undertaker.\nIn the research of service outsourcing improving the technological innovation\nability of contractor enterprises, Ren Zhicheng found that the innovation ability of contracting enterprises has been improved by the fact that the international software outsourcing has produced technology spillover. Among the various possible ways of\ntechnology spillover, human capital plays the most prominent role.[13] Chen Haibo believed that the import of productive services can significantly improve the technological innovation efficiency of China's equipment manufacturing industry.[14]\nIn the research on technological innovation in the process of manufacturing\nservice-oriented transformation of the manufacturing industry, the manufacturing industry shows a clear trend of service-oriented transformation, and my country also regards service-oriented manufacturing as an important direction for the transformation and upgrading of the manufacturing industry. Luo Jianqiang believes that the development of adaptable services relying on existing product technologies has become the key to the transformation of manufacturing into services. [15]Zhao Lilong et al. found that when the technical capability of the enterprise is weak, implementing the incremental service innovation strategy can effectively increase product value and improve market performance. When the technical ability is strong, the implementation of the breakthrough service innovation strategy can form a knowledge spillover effect with the technical ability, which is more conducive to the improvement of market and financial performance. [16]\nIn the research on the impact of technological innovation on service performance,\nBased on the theory of technological innovation and the theory of knowledge capital, Chen Wei found that the service-oriented transformation of manufacturing has a significant positive impact on technological innovation, but there is ind ustry heterogeneity in this impact.[17]\n4.1.3. Service outsourcing\nThe keywords extracted from cluster #3 \u201cservice outsourcing\u201d are service outsourcing, organizational learning, service industry, and knowledge sharing. In the research on service outsourcing clustering, there are many studies mainly from the perspective of the contractor. Whether the contractor can improve its own innovation ability by undertaking service outsourcing business, the existing research has confirmed this point of view, but whether the innovation ability can be improved the expansion of service outsourcing has different conclusions. For example, Cui Ping conducted an empirical study on 21 service outsourcing demonstration cities in my country development of. Through the empirical data of Zhejiang Province[18], Xu Shan verified that Zhejiang Province's undertaking of international service outsourcing has significantly promoted the development of regional innovation capabilities and promoted the transformation of innovation achievements, but the improvement of innovation capabilities has not yet stimulated the expansion of service outsourcing.[19]\nIn the research on the improvement path of the contractor's innovation ability in\nservice outsourcing, the spillover of technology or knowledge will greatly improve the contractor's innovation ability. Tan Yunqing found that the spillover effect depends on the absorptive capacity of service providers, and the absorptive capacity is also affected by the enterprise's own R&D capital, human capital, social capital and knowledge management system.[20]\nIn the research on how to promote innovation in the service outsourcing industry,\nMa Fang concluded that industrial agglomeration is the premise and foundation of collaborative innovation, and collaborative innovation is an important means to enhance industrial competitiveness. Innovation ability to realize the rapid development of software and information service outsourcing industry. [21]Li Hongzhou's research found that if the contracting enterprises can effectively use the knowledge creation\nmechanism, the ability lever mechanism and the knowledge sharing mechanism, it is entirely possible to build their own innovation ability. From the perspective of knowledge management,[22] Ai Zhong found that improving the organizational learning ability, knowledge sharing level and absorptive ability of service outsourcing enterprises can promote the improvement of enterprise innovation ability.[23]\nWhat factors in service innovation have an impact on innovation performance?\nZhang Pei explored the process of business model innovation in productive service outsourcing from the perspective of value co-creation. Different interaction paths between customers and enterprises in value co-creation will lead to different types of service innovation. patterns, with significant contextual differences.[24]Liu Wenxia found that cognitive trust and emotional trust not only directly affect collaborative innovation performance, but also indirectly affect it through knowledge acquisition.[25]\n4.1.4. Value co-creation\nThe keywords extracted from cluster #4 \u201cvalue co-creation\u201d are value co-creation, collaborative innovation, interaction orientation, innovation performance, and knowledge service. With the deepening of research on service innovation, how to realize value co-creation among service-oriented manufacturing enterprises, supplier networks and customer networks has become a hot topic. Research methods in this field include empirical research and qualitative research, most of which take a specific enterprise as the research object to conduct case analysis.\nIn the research on the relationship between value co-creation and service\nperformance, many scholars have verified through research that value co-creation is a key promoting factor for the realization of service-oriented strategies on service performance. In the study of its specific mechanism, Kang Yao et al. Empirical research finds that value co-creation plays a moderating effect between service-oriented transformation strategy and service performance. [26] Zhou Wenhui's research found that under the promotion of innovation leaders, the content of knowledge service and the process of value co-creation interact, and jointly promote the transformation of knowledge service into innovation performance.[27]Wang Lina used the grounded theory to study the reform of Haier's \u201cRendanheyi\u201d model, and studied how to promote the transformation of manufacturing services through value co-creation from the perspective of strategy, value chain, organizational structure and accounting system. [28]\nIn the research on how value co-creation promotes service innovation, Hu Yanling\nrevealed the value co-creation mechanism of big data alliance data service innovation from the collaborative dimension of \u201cresource-capability-relationship\u201d. [29]Jian Zhaoquan found that within the service ecosystem, the facilitative factors such as institutions, value propositions and experience contexts promote value co-creation and service innovation through interaction mechanisms.[30]Xie Lishan found the organizational interaction orientation perceived by employees and the degree of customer value co-creation positively affect the customer demand knowledge level of front-line employees. and employee innovation behavior; the customer demand knowledge of frontline employees has a significant positive impact on employee innovation behavior. [31]\n4.1.5. Industrial clusters\nThe keywords extracted from cluster #5 \u201cindustrial cluster\u201d are industrial clusters, network characteristics, information service industry, and innovation networks. Most of the literatures on this cluster are based on evolutionary game theory, discussing how different subjects play games to achieve cooperative innovation, and there are many studies on industrial clusters, which study how to serve industrial clusters, such as information services.\nThe literature on industrial cluster clustering mostly uses specific industrial\nclusters as case studies. Some of the research objects are, for example, agricultural regional industrial clusters in Shouguang, Shandong Province, integrated development of traditional industries and e-commerce in Shantou, Guangdong, cross-border ecommerce comprehensive pilot zones, and Shanghai biomedicine, Guangdong Furniture, National Advertising Industrial Park, etc. self-service systems that adapt to the development stage of industrial clusters. However, combined with the upgrading trends and needs of industrial clusters, systematic analysis of industrial cluster service systems is relatively insufficient.\nIn the research on the formation mechanism of industrial clusters, the government\nplays a larger role in the process of promoting the formation of industrial clusters. For example, when the vegetable industry cluster in Shouguang City was formed, the government created a good innovation environment for the development of the cluster, provided supporting infrastructure, Agricultural training system, information service center, banking and insurance and other financial services, formulating standardized production guidelines, etc.\nService system innovation is an important condition to ensure the sustainable,\nrapid and healthy development of industrial clusters. In some traditional manufacturing clusters in China, many of them are based on OEM production methods, and there is a problem of ignoring their own brand building and market cultivation, resulting in low product added value, Weak technological innovation capability, incomplete industrial chain, low level of cluster coordination, and extensive management.[32] At present, the management services in industrial clusters cannot meet the development needs of industrial clusters, and services must be innovated. In these studies, the main body of the government plays a leading role.\n4.1.6. Internet +\nThe keywords extracted from cluster #6 \u201cInternet+\u201d are Internet+, big data, business model, and value creation. This clustering has a lot of overlap with other clustering contents. The research is mainly on the service-oriented manufacturing industry, using technologies or means such as big data and knowledge management to innovate manufacturing services. The research on this clustering is dedicated to creating new business models.\nIn the context of Internet+, the Internet has changed the connotation and driving\nfactors of service innovation, and will also have an impact on the innovation model and path of the service industry at the macro level. Combining the service-dominant logic and value co-creation theory, Di Rong analyzed the value creation process of breakthrough service innovation, and constructed an efficient realization mechanism of breakthrough service innovation value co-creation, which provides service-oriented enterprises with breakthrough service innovation strategies. Countermeasures suggested.[33] Based on the new situation of deep integration of \u201cInternet +\u201d and\ntraditional industries, Tu Ying put forward the \u201cInternet + Power Marketing\u201d intelligent interactive service innovation system, and constructed four levels of resource guarantee, data support, business management, and operation management.[34]\nBased on the cluster names of the LLR algorithm, these clusters are further\nsummarized and sorted, and the above hot topics in the Chinese service innovation field can be roughly divided into three themes: innovation in information technology, including clustering technology innovation, Internet+; business model. Innovation, including clustering manufacturing enterprises, service outsourcing; management innovation, including industrial clusters, value co-creation."

It is expected that the number of service innovation will increase in the future. From the perspective of the authors of the article, there is less cooperation between authors, but there are also small-scale cooperation networks. From the point of view of institutions, the issuing institutions are mainly colleges and universities, indicating that colleges and universities are the main research groups, but the industryuniversity research is insufficient. This situation is not conducive to academic communication and research development. Therefore, an academic research system of service innovation should be built with the participation of multiple subjects.\nThrough keyword clustering analysis, it is found that manufacturing enterprises,\ntechnological Innovation, service outsourcing, value co-creation, industrial clusters, Internet + and other topics are the research hot topics of service innovation in the past\nten years, and through induction service innovation mainly focuses on innovations in technology, model and management."

            "text": "There have been many mature research results in the research on service innovation, and a certain theoretical system has been formed, but in-depth research and discussion still need to be carried out in the following aspects:\n(1) Service innovation for the normalization of the epidemic. In the literature\nsamples of this study, a secondary search was performed, and a search condition was added to the CNKI database to include \u201cepidemic\u201d in the full text, and a total of 11 results were obtained. This shows that under the normalization of the epidemic situation, there are not many high-level journal documents related to service innovation. In the current situation of repeated and normalized epidemics, how to carry out service innovation while taking into account the requirements of epidemic prevention is a major research direction in the future, especially in the cultural tourism industry.\n(2) Contribute to the realization of the \u201cdual carbon\u201d goal. The Chinese\ngovernment has committed to \u201ccarbon peaking\u201d by 2030 and \u201ccarbon neutrality\u201d by 2060. The realization of the \u201cdual carbon\u201d goal is an irreversible global consensus and trend, which is related to the sustainable development of the Chinese nation and the building of a community with a shared future for mankind. To achieve the \u201cdual carbon\u201d goal, it is necessary to reform the existing economic structure and reduce carbon emissions, which is a good development opportunity for the service industry and other industries' service business, so how to carry out service innovation to reduce carbon emissions It is also a research hot topic in the future, and it is also a direction for future scholars to further study.\n(3) Research in the field of service intelligence. Information technology, network technology and the information platform formed on this basis play an important role in promoting service innovation and the modern development of the service industry. The application of ICT has become an important way to strengthen service innovation, improve core competitiveness and improve efficiency. In the literature research on service innovation in the past decade, the research on big data and Internet+ is the hot content of service innovation research. However, with the rapid development of science and technology, in the web3.0 era, emerging technologies and applications such as AI and the meta universe have become the focus of the future development of major companies. 2021 is called the first year of the meta universe. Service intelligence has been fully proven in the application field, but as a new research field, The depth and breadth of the research still need to be expanded. In the future, research achievements in the field of service intelligence will increase dramatically, and future research directions in the field of service innovation also need to increase corresponding research in this area.\n(4) Integration of service industry and other industries. In the service industry innovation and development outline 2017-2025, it can be learned that China is encouraging industrial integration, and plans to build a number of service oriented primary, secondary and tertiary industry integration leading enterprises to promote the integration of the service industry and agriculture. However, in the existing literature, most of the research on service innovation is based on specific industries, and there is less research on industrial integration, especially on agricultural service innovation. This field can be regarded as a new research content in the future. To study how the\ncooperation between enterprises and advantageous agricultural product producing areas can form an online and offline agricultural product circulation mode, and how to use information technology to optimize agricultural production and operation decisionmaking, agricultural technology training, agricultural product supply and demand docking and other services.\nAfter entering the 21st century, the integration development trend of manufacturing industry and service industry has been fully demonstrated, and the boundary between manufacturing and service is increasingly blurred. The research on service-oriented manufacturing is relatively sufficient. Although service civilization depends on industrial civilization to a certain extent, in the new historical period, industrial civilization needs more guidance from service civilization. There are few researches on the expansion of services to manufacturing."
