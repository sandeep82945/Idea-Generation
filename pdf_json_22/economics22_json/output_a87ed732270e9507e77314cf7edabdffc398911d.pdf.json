Clinical data were derived from a randomized, double-blind controlled\ntrial on Chinese inpatients who received HEC. Quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) were\nused to estimate the utility outcomes and the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER)\nwas calculated to assess the economics of FosAPR. A static budget impact model\nwas developed to assess the impact of FosAPR as a new addition to the National\nReimbursement Drug List (NRDL) on the medical insurance fund within 3 years in\nNanjing, China.\nResults: Compared with APR, FosAPR had a mean health-care savings of U121.56\nbut got a reduction of 0.0001815 QALY, resulting in an ICER of U669926.19 per\nQALY. Deterministic sensitivity analysis revealed that the cost of APR was the most\ninfluential factor to the ICER. The cost of FosAPR and the complete control rate of\nthe delayed period also had a high impact on the results. According to the probabilistic\nanalysis, the acceptability of FosAPR was more than 80% when the Chinese willingness-\nto-pay (WTP) was U215,999. FosAPR would lead to a 3-year medical insurance\npayment increase of U1.84 million compared with U1.49 million before FosAPR entered\nNRDL in Nanjing. The total budget increased with a cumulative cost of U694,829 and\ncovered an additional 341 patients who benefited from FosAPR in Nanjing. Deterministic\nsensitivity analysis showed that the model of budget impact analysis was stable.\nConclusion: FosAPR had a similar treatment effect to APR but was cost-effective in\nChina at the current WTP threshold. The total budget of medical insurance payments\nof Nanjing slightly increased year by year after the inclusion of FosAPR. Its inclusion in\nthe NRDL would be acceptable and also expand the coverage of patients who benefited\nfrom FosAPR.\nKeywords: cost-effectiveness, budget impact analysis, antiemetic, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting, fosaprepitant"

            "heading": "INTRODUCTION",
            "text": "Cancer is now a global concern and a heavy burden on the health systems of all countries in the world. According to the \u201cGlobal Cancer Statistics\u201d published by the American Cancer Society, there were 18.1 million new cases of cancer worldwide and 9.6 million cases of cancer deaths in 2018 (1). While in 2020, the number of new cancer cases rose to 19.3 million and almost 10.0 million cancer deaths around the world (2). In recent years, new treatment methods for malignant tumors, such as immunotherapy, targeted therapy, and genetic therapy, have developed rapidly. However, as one of the commonly used treatments for cancer, chemotherapy is still one of the most effective methods. Drugs of chemotherapy are generally cytotoxic, most of which lack targeting for tumor cells. They may also harm the normal cells of the body, leading to more adverse drug reactions. Digestive system reaction, alopecia, bone marrow suppression, liver, and kidney function damage are common toxic and side effects of chemotherapy. Meanwhile, some cytotoxic drugs have specific side effects. For example, doxorubicin has cardiotoxicity, which may cause damage to myocardial cells, and even lead to heart failure in severe cases. Different chemotherapy strategies had different adverse drug reactions (ADR).\nOf all the adverse reactions, chemotherapy-induced nausea and vomiting (CINV) is one of the most common side effects of chemotherapy. It makes patients suffer from low-quality lives and has a large negative impact on patient compliance. Also, it can decline patients\u2019 performance status and even make them withdraw from the chemotherapy (3\u20135). A clinical study by Zhang and Li (6) showed a low rate of antiemetic guideline compliance in chemotherapy patients, implying that medical care still had a lot of shortcomings in this field. Based on the risk of emetic and percentage of incidence of vomiting, it was widely accepted that we divided anti-tumor drugs into four grades: (1) high, with over 90% risk of vomiting; (2) moderate, with 30\u201390% risks; (3) low, with 10\u201330% risks; and (4) minimal, with below 10% risks of vomiting (7). The risk here is the incidence of vomiting without preventive treatment. Generally speaking, the emetic of platinum-based chemotherapy regimens is considered at moderate and high grades. In light of the time of occurrence, CINV can be divided into three phases, acute phase (0\u201324 h), delayed phase (25 h), and anticipatory CINV. Anticipatory CINV occurred more frequently in patients who experienced CINV in previous chemotherapy. Previous literature indicated that the incidence of emesis in the delayed phase was\ncorrelated with, but not dependent on that in the acute phase (8). In addition, there are many patient-related risk factors for CINV. Systematic reviews and guidelines identified that history of nausea or vomiting, female sex, younger age, and expectancy of CINV could all influence or even increase the incidence of CINV in patients (9\u201313). As a result, it is important to improve the quality of care for the patients who received high-emetic chemotherapy (HEC) carefully from various aspects.\nOne of the effective preventions of nausea and vomiting is to give prior antiemetic drugs before and during chemotherapy. 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT3), substance P (SP), dopamine, acetylcholine, and histamine are neurotransmitters closely related to CINV. In recent years, 5-HT3 was considered to play an important role in preventing CINV, especially in the acute phase. Furthermore, substance P is a regulatory polypeptide that can bind to neurokinin (NK) receptors and emerges as the dominant driver of the CINV in the delayed phase. The antiinflammatory effects of glucocorticoids are also used clinically to prevent the occurrence of delayed CINV. Therefore, 5-HT3 receptor antagonists (5-HT3 RA), NK-1 receptor antagonists (NK-1 RA), glucocorticoids, general antiemetic drugs protonpump receptor inhibitors (PPI), and H2 receptor antagonists are several types of drugs, which are conventionally used to prevent nausea and vomiting. Ondansetron, granisetron, palonosetron, dexamethasone, aprepitant (APR), etc. are all commonly used antiemetic drugs. For moderate or high risks of vomiting, a coprescription of two or three antiemetic medications would be frequently given as the guideline-recommended.\nAprepitant is a type of NK-1 RA, it can selectively inhibit the link between the substance P and NK-1 receptors, thus blocking the pathway to vomiting. Some clinical trials and observational studies revealed that aprepitant could statistically significantly improve the prevention of emesis compared to the control regimen and this effect was also observed in children (8, 14\u201316), which showed its outstanding antiemetic function. However, to completely control the CINV, aprepitant needs to be used 48 h after the chemotherapy is dosed, accompanied by much inconvenience. As a result, fosaprepitant (FosAPR) was synthesized to solve the inexpediency of aprepitant. Fosaprepitant is a prodrug of aprepitant, which can convert into aprepitant after absorption. Its bioavailability is almost 100% which is much higher than aprepitant. Secondly, fosaprepitant is easy to use and has the characteristics of a quick effect. Its intravenous infusion can be completed in 30min before the start of chemotherapy and can rapidly converse to active compounds in the liver (17).\nFrontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org 2 July 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 913129\nEven though appropriate antiemetic precautions could stop \u223c70\u201380% of CINV episodes (18), the status quo of the CINV is not optimistic. There are more than 30% of patients still suffering from nausea and vomiting after receiving antiemetic treatment (4). Therefore, rescue treatments are badly required when CINV occurs. The basic principle of rescue treatments is to recheck the antiemetic regimens and give different types of antiemetic drugs as appropriate. As for the rescue drugs, except for 5-HT3 RA, guidelines and expert consensus recommended treatments including promethazine, metoclopramide, olanzapine, lorazepam, haloperidol, scopolamine, omeprazole, etc.\nSince 2007, studies have been conducted in seven countries to evaluate the economic value of prophylactic antiemetic regimens (19\u201324). Most of them showed favorable results with APR. For instance, in 2019, Kashiwa et al. demonstrated that the economic efficiency of the addition of FosAPR to prophylactic antiemetic therapy for outpatient HEC was not cost-effective, although the addition of APR was cost-effective in the context of the Japanese healthcare system (25). However, due to huge differences in different healthcare systems, the economic value of a pharmaceutical product may vary by country. A study in the United States found that APR had little cost-effectiveness benefit.\nBased on the Institute for Clinical and Economic Review (ICER) Value Framework 2.0, the economic efficiency and affordability of health technology should be simultaneously considered for inclusion in the reimbursement list (26). Moreover, whether a new drug can be afforded by public health insurance funds is the key issue for its value evidence. Since 2019, enterprises must submit the economic evidence from Costeffectiveness Analysis (CEA) and Budget Impact Analysis (BIA) to the National Healthcare Security Administration (NHSA) for inclusion in the National Reimbursement Drug List (NRDL) of China.\nHowever, the comprehensive economic assessment of FosAPR-containing regimen therapy for cancer patients in China remains unknown. Especially, there is a lack of comparison between FosAPR and APR. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness and budget impact of the FosAPRcontaining regimen from the perspective of Chinese payers for patients who received HEC in the context of the Chinese healthcare setting. The BIA of FosAPR was crucial to provide modeling estimates to support evidence-based decision-making for drug reimbursement. It could also be used for budget or resource planning to ensure that the medical insurance funding was affordable if FosAPR would be included in the NRDL."

Cancer patients to be enrolled were required to be between 18 and 75 years old receiving high-risk emetic chemotherapy and had a good physical condition, with an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status score between 0 and 2. In addition, the patient\u2019s expected survival time should have been longer than 3 months. A total of 645 patients in 21 centers in China who received chemotherapy including highrisk emetogenic drugs were included in this trial. In this study, patients were divided into APR (n = 317) or FosAPR (n = 328) group randomly. There was no significant difference in demographic data between the two groups. The baseline characteristics of the patients in this study are shown in Table 1. Because the clinical data was selected from the published report of clinical trial, ethical approval was not required for the study on participants in accordance with the local legislation and institutional requirements.\nFrontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org 3 July 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 913129\nA triple therapy regimen (FosAPR (150mg IV d1) or APR (125mg orally d1; 80mg orally d2\u2013d3) plus granisetron and dexamethasone) was used to prevent vomiting.

The complete response rate (CRR) and complete control rate (CCR) in both phases were elicited from the trial report (Table 2).

Only direct medical costs are incorporated in this study, including drug therapy, rescue therapy, hospitalization, and drug administration. Antiemetic treatment drugs and rescue drugs were described above. The costs of hospitalization consisted of blood routine, blood biochemistry, prescription preparation, and basic consumables. Due to the chemotherapy, all patients were the inpatients, so the hospitalization costs of the two groups were equal in this research. The unit prices of drugs and medical examinations were derived from the surveys that were conducted in local hospitals (e.g., The Affiliated Bayi Hospital of Nanjing University of Chinese Medicine and Nanjing Drum Tower Hospital). The report of the WHO Macroeconomic Committee recommends 1\u20133 times gross domestic product (GDP) per capita as the threshold for judging the cost-effectiveness of drug. Triple Chinese 2020 GDP per capita (U215,999) was set to be the willingness-to-pay (WTP) threshold. However, the impact of adverse drug reactions (ADR) was not considered in this study. Also, the discount rate was not considered in the simulation as the trial only lasted for 5 days.\nThe utility value of three health states of CINV in the Chinese population has not been reported in a clinical trial or published literature before. Referring to the previous studies (25, 28, 29), we separately set the three utility values as 0.9, 0.7, and 0.3. The costs and utility values are summarized in Table 3.\nHealth outcomes were measured by quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). The sum of the 5-day QALYs was calculated as follows:\n5-day QALY = (UAcute \u2217 1 day+ UDelayed \u2217 4 days)/365 days\nThe 5-day QALYs of the acute and delayed phases are presented in Table 4. To evaluate the cost-effectiveness of FosAPR compared with APR, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated and was used to compare with the WTP threshold. If the ICER value is less than the WTP threshold, it means that FosAPR is cost-effective compared to APR. Otherwise, it is not economical.\nICER = (CostFosAPR \u2212 CostAPR)/(QALYFosAPR \u2212 QALYAPR)"

At the end of 2019, the total population of Nanjing was 8.5 million. The incidence of cancer in China is about 201 per 100,000 people (33). Due to the lack of relevant epidemiological data in China, it was not possible to calculate the total number of patients receiving HEC. Consulting the research of Restelli et al. (34) in Italy, patients who suffered from lung cancer, head and neck cancer, gastric cancer, testicular cancer, and bladder cancer were selected as the population of HEC. By calculation, there were about 5,793 cancer patients receiving HEC regimens in Nanjing. The morbidities of five cancers are shown in Table 5."

The market share of antiemetics for CINV in 2021 was obtained from Jiangsu Institute of Medicine Information, which is a large database with medicine procurement records covering 35 secondary and tertiary hospitals and 27 primary health institutions in Nanjing, China. Nanjing is the capital of Jiangsu Province, which is located in\nthe southeast coast of China, with a population of over 9 million (in 2020) residing across 11 municipal districts. The total gross domestic product (GDP) of this city was 1,481.8 billion CNY (\u223cUS$228.8 billion) in 2020, which represents the middle-andupper level of economic development in Eastern China. Due to its superior geographical position, the 62 sampled healthcare institutions in Nanjing usually provide medical services to the residents of 3 provinces and 1 municipality (Jiangsu Province, Zhejiang Province, Anhui Province, and Shanghai Municipality) in China. Therefore, the data from the drug market in Nanjing was regional representative. The market share of antiemetics for CINV in Nanjing in 2021 was still dominated by 5-HT3 receptor antagonists, with dolasetron, tropisetron, ondansetron, palonosetron, and azasetron as the top five. The market share was 32.03, 24.75, 16.43, 14.60, and 6.85%, followed by Granisetron and APR, which accounted for 4.96 and 0.39%, respectively. The brand-name APR was produced by Merck and was approved for import registration in July 2013 in China. But the brand name FosAPR was not listed. In October 2019, generic FosAPR injections produced by Chia Tai Tianqing Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd., and Hausen Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. were successively approved for marketing in China. Therefore, we set the market share of this drug to 0% in 2021. Ramosetron and netupitant and palonosetron capsules were not considered for the BIA for they have not been included in the local health insurance drug list of Nanjing. Based on market research, database, and literature (38), FosAPR would compete with 5-HT3 receptor antagonists and APR in the antiemetic drug market of CINV after being included in the NRDL. There was no difference in the ratio of market share decline of all seven competing products. Themarket share of each 5-HT3 receptor antagonist andNK-1 RA (APR)was set to decline by a linear ratio of 2% every year (39). For example, the market share of Dorasetron in 2021 is 24.75%. After a linear decrease of 2%, the market share is expected to be 24.75%\u2217 (1\u20130.02) = 24.25% in 2022 and 24.75%\u2217 (1\u20130.02) \u22272 = 23.77% in 2023. The changes of the market share of each drug within 3 years after the entry of FosAPR into the health insurance drug list are shown in Table 6."

The unit prices of drugs were originated from the survey of the drug purchase prices in Nanjing. The Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO) Guidelines for Prevention and Treatment of Nausea and Vomiting Caused by Anti-tumor Therapies 2019 was referred to make the dosing plan (40). The administration schemes and the prices of a single course of therapies are shown in Table 7.\nPalonosetron, granisetron, and FosAPR were available in two specifications, so the average cost per course was used. FosAPR and APR must be used in combination with palonosetron (0.25mg, day 1) and dexamethasone tablets (6mg, day 1; 3.75mg, days 2\u20133). 5-HT3 receptor antagonists should be combined with dexamethasone injection (10mg, per day 1). The cost of dexamethasone was too low to take into account. The treatment cycle was calculated to be about 6 cycles by the weighted average of the first-line chemotherapy regimens for the cancers included in the study (41\u201347). Accordingly, the study assumed that antiemetic drugs were administered 6 times within a year. Based on the individual out-of-pocket (OOP) standard of medical insurance in Nanjing (48), the OOP ratio of all kinds of antiemetic drugs varied from 0.1 to 0.5. The proportion of reimbursement was about 80% defined by the Nanjing Medical Insurance Bureau. Take ondansetron as an example, its OOP ratio in Nanjing for urban employee was 0.1 and its annual cost was U407.88. The cost covered by medical insurance would be 407.88\u2217(1\u20130.1) \u221780% = 293.67 CNY. Assume that FosAPR was covered by health insurance, with an OOP ratio of 0.5 and an estimated 80% of reimbursement similar to APR. The final single\ncourse cost, annual cost, and cost covered by health insurance of each antiemetic drug are summarized in Table 8."

Otherwise, FosAPR was a more recommended option when choosing antiemetic drugs before performing high-emetic chemotherapy.\nPSA scatter plot showed that most scatter were in the third quadrant, which meant FosAPR was more economical compared with APR. At the same time, more than two-thirds of the scatters were below the WTP threshold line, implying that people\u2019s acceptance of FosAPR was far higher than that of APR at the current WTP threshold (Figure 3). As well as the acceptance curve displayed, the probability that FosAPR could be costeffective was over 80% when the WTP threshold was U215,999. As the WTP threshold rose, the probability of cost-effectiveness gradually decreased (Figure 4). The curve implied that the higher the threshold, the higher the tendency of patients to choose APR.

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "There were only a few published health technology assessment programs about FosAPR globally. To our knowledge, this is the first study to calculate the economic value of FosAPR for preventing CINV in patients who received moderate to high emetic chemotherapy from the perspective of the Chinese healthcare system for the affordability of health insurance funding. In detail, this study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of the FosAPR-containing regimen vs. the APR-containing regimen and conducted a budget impact analysis of the inclusion of FosAPR into the NRDL of China based on phase 3 clinical trial and real-world statistics.\nIn the cost-effectiveness analysis, although the APRcontaining regimen had a higher cost than FosAPR, it gained a better outcome of QALY in patients. However, by calculating the ICER of two antiemetic drugs, we could not observe the pharmacoeconomic advantage of APR. As the cost of inpatient and other drugs in the antiemetic regimens were the same for both groups, the high drug price of APR might be the dominant factor that affected its economics. Despite the differences in the incidences of ADR, the disparities in administrations of rescue were minimal. The sensitivity analyses were conducted and confirmed the robustness of the model. With the expiration of the APR patent and the successive appearance on the market of its generic drugs, its cost-effectiveness might gradually emerge. Otherwise, if the price of APR remained high, for FosAPR, the probability of being more cost-effective in the\nFrontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org 7 July 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 913129\nacceptability curves would still be greater than that of APR in the Chinese background set by our study. In the European countries, Restelli et al. (34) constructed a Markov model to incorporate netupitant, aprepitant, and fosaprepitant into the cost-utility and budget impact analyses from the perspective of the Italian National Health Service (NHS). The results of the study illustrated that the netupitant-containing regimen was the most cost-effective. Besides, the cost-utility analysis conducted by Kashiwa and Matsushita (25) compared APR and FosAPR with a standard regimen based on data from two different trials, respectively, which revealed the cost-effectiveness of the addition of APR. Contrary to these studies, FosAPR showed an economic advantage in the context of the Chinese healthcare system. We speculated that it might be related to the following reasons. First, clinical data referred in studies were different in population and study design, which resulted in different response rates of patients. In Kashiwa\u2019s study, the economic results compared the addition of APR or FosAPR relatively with the standard regimen, forming an indirect comparison between APR and FosAPR. However, the clinical trial incorporated in this study was a randomized, parallel-group study in the Chinese population (27). Based on the trial, the conclusion of the cost-effectiveness of the FosAPR-containing regimen took the APR-containing regimen as the control group. Second, the health care program combined medical components in various combinations. There are huge differences in medical components between different countries, which led to cost differences. Third, from the perspective of Japanese payers, the price of FosAPR was higher than APR ($129.67 vs. 103.76). The total costs of FosAPR- or APR-containing regimen were $208.87 and 173.89, respectively, making the addition of FosAPR not cost-effective eventually. In China, the price negotiation between NHSA\nFIGURE 3 | Probabilistic sensitivity analysis of FosAPR vs. APR. WTP, willingness-to-pay; QALY, quality-adjusted life year.\nand drug manufacturers had significantly reduced the price of FosAPR (U512.48 of FosAPR vs. U634.88 of APR), leading to its increase in cost-effectiveness.\nAs for the budget impact analysis, it might slightly increase the health insurance budget expenditure (1.49 million in 2021 to 1.84 million in 2024) and have a certain impact on the burden of the medical insurance fund if FosAPR was included in the NRDL of China. It could be related to the following factors. Firstly, the price of FosAPR was high, which was one of the most important reasons. The costs of other antiemetics were <U200 every single course. In addition, FosAPR needed to be combined with palonosetron for therapy, whose single course cost was more thanU500. Therefore, the increase in market share after the addition of FosAPR in NRDL would inevitably lead to an increase in medical expenditure. However, the incremental\nFrontiers in Public Health | www.frontiersin.org 8 July 2022 | Volume 10 | Article 913129\nbudget was no more than 20% of the total amount of health insurance that covered antiemetic drugs every year. According to the Statistical Bulletin on the Development of Medical Security in 2020 (49), announced by the Nanjing Medical Security Bureau on 21 July 2021, the total expenditure of health insurance funds was U258,22 million. The cumulated incremental budget only accounted for a tiny proportion (0.003%) of the total expenditure, which may lead to a minor impact on the overall budget fund. Besides, the application of antiemetic drugs could reduce the mounting cost pressure on oncology to some extent. Secondly, the expected market share in 3 years of FosAPR in the model was much larger than those in actual status. According to the baseline proportion of drug purchases in Nanjing, the application of NK-1 RA in the market has not been widely promoted, so the promotion speed of NK-1 RA in the market was lower than our assumption. Therefore, the actual market share of FosAPR 3 years after its inclusion in the NRDLmight be much smaller than the estimated share in the study. From the sensitivity analysis, we could see that if the ratio of market share decline dropped from 2 to 1.6%, the insurance budget and the cumulative costs would reduce accordingly compared with the base-case result. In other words, as the market promotion of FosAPR in real world could be smaller than our assumption, the actual impact on the insurance budget would be little after its inclusion in the NRDL. The results of BIA were based on the assumptions of the study and the estimates of the market, so the calculated health insurance expenditure of Nanjing might be overestimated, which was also one of the limitations of this BIA.\nAccording to the guidelines and published pieces of literature (41\u201347), we found that chemotherapy was still one of the most effective andwidely recommendedmethods for treatment in each period of cancer. Therefore, in this study, the incidence rate of five types of cancer in China was used to calculate the target population for receiving HEC. Similarly, in another Italian study that focused on the budget impact analysis of netupitant and palonosetron, the incidence rates of five types of cancer were also used to calculate the population for receiving HEC (34)."

In general, the lack of rate of local HEC usage in China could lead to calculation errors in the target population, affecting the BIA results to some extent. In addition, due to the different medical insurance reimbursement policies across the country, this study only selected Nanjing urban medical insurance reimbursement policy as the reference for budget analysis, which might cause deviation in the results if the results were extended to the whole nation. This study also had some limitations in CEA. Firstly, we did not consider outpatients\u2019 situations because of the shortages in outpatients\u2019 research, which posed a certain obstacle to providing evidence for the medication chosen for outpatients. Secondly, we only brought direct medical costs in the CEA study, neglecting the indirect medical cost impacts on patients in the real world.

The incremental BI of predicted years was relatively acceptable for the medical insurance fund. When considering whether the drug is included in the NRDL, the medical insurance payers should make a comprehensive investigation to negotiate the drug price, improve the economy of FosAPR, and the affordability of the medical insurance fund as much as possible."
