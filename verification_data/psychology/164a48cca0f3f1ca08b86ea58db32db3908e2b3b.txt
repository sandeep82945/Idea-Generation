The portion of the text mentioning future research directions is not explicitly outlined in the provided sections. However, the conclusion and the detailed description of the study's findings, methodologies, and implications often hint at future research directions indirectly by discussing the potential applications, limitations, and unanswered questions of the current study. In this case, the conclusion highlights the discovery and characterization of the peptide APLVSW (AW6) with ACEI and DPP4I activities, its stability against simulated gastrointestinal digestion, and its quantification in various fractions. While not directly stating future research directions, the conclusion suggests areas for further exploration, such as the development of food supplements or therapeutic agents based on AW6, and the potential for additional studies to explore other bioactive peptides in bitter gourd seed protein hydrolysate. 

For direct mentions of future research directions, one would typically look for statements that explicitly mention "future studies," "further research," "next steps," or similar phrases within the context of addressing current study limitations, proposing the exploration of additional mechanisms, or suggesting the application of findings in new contexts. These are often found in the discussion or conclusion sections of a research paper.
