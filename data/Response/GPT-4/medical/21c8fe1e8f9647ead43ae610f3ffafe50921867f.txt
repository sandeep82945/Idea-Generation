Genetic Engineering for Resistance: Investigate the potential of using CRISPR-Cas9 or other gene editing technologies to introduce or enhance resistance genes in tomato and potato plants against A. solani and P. infestans. This research could focus on targeting specific genes associated with pathogen recognition and defense mechanism activation in plants.

Biocontrol Agents and Natural Antifungals: Explore the use of beneficial microbes or natural compounds that exhibit antagonistic properties against A. solani and P. infestans. This could include isolating and characterizing microbes from the rhizosphere of resistant plant varieties or identifying natural compounds that can inhibit pathogen growth without harming the host plant.

Environmental Influence on Pathogen Evolution: Conduct longitudinal studies to understand how changes in climate and agricultural practices influence the genetic diversity and virulence of A. solani and P. infestans. This could involve monitoring pathogen populations over time in various geographical locations and under different farming practices to identify evolutionary trends and emerging threats.

Host-Pathogen Interaction Dynamics: Deepen the investigation into the molecular interactions between A. solani/P. infestans and their host plants, focusing on the mechanisms of infection, host penetration, and the suppression of plant defense responses. This research could utilize transcriptomics and proteomics to identify key molecules involved in the interaction and how they may be manipulated for improved plant resistance.

Integrated Disease Management Strategies: Develop and test integrated disease management (IDM) strategies that combine genetic resistance, cultural practices, biological control, and judicious use of fungicides to manage early and late blight diseases effectively. This research would aim to provide sustainable, environmentally friendly approaches to disease management that reduce reliance on chemical fungicides and minimize the risk of resistance development.
