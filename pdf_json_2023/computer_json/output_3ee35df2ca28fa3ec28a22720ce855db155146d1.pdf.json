            "text": "Global warming is going on and the frequency of large-scale meteorological dis-asters around the world is increasing [1]. In Japan as well, large-scale damage caused by strong winds and heavy rain of typhoons and bomb cyclones is on the rise. One of the damages caused by strong winds and heavy rains is the occurrence of blackouts due to failure of power transmission and distribution network. Tokyo Electric Power Company posted a special loss of 11.8 billion yen due to the damage caused by Typhoon No. 15 in 2019 [2]. Power outages have affected the lives of residents, industry and other corporate activities, as well as the medical activities of hospitals, which are directly linked to human life. The economic loss by power outage will be crucial. In the event of such a weather disaster, domestic electric power companies will set up countermeasures headquarters in advance and aims to shorten the power outage time by deploying restoration personnel and equipment in advance. However, it is not possible to accurately predict in advance where damage will occur in the power transmission and distribution network. Therefore, it has been necessary to dispatch patrols to the accident points where it is assumed that damage will occur based on reports from consumers, etc., and then order of restoration work after confirming the extent of the damage. In addition, while personnel for patrol and restoration work are on their way to the site, they may not be able to move further due to the collapse of utility poles or trees, which causes an increase in the time required for restoration.\nTo overcome these difficulties, we are promoting research on resilient grid technology to minimize power outage damage caused by disasters and realize stable power supply [3]. The goal of a resilient grid is to accurately and quickly perform the initial response after a disaster, from assessing the situation to identifying the cause, and formulating and implementing a recovery plan. For restoration, it is necessary to aim for early recovery by using isolated operation of photovoltaic (PV), power supply cars and so on in\nand distribution network and utility poles. The problem with planning and executing a recovery plan is that it takes time to gather information to understand the extent of the damage and to travel to the location where the failure occurred. Typhoon No. 15 in 2019 caused a lot of damage, and in some cases it took two weeks to collect information at the disaster site due to the effects of landslide and collapsed objects [4].\nIn this study, we proposed the Poles-Aware Moving Cost Estimation Method (PACEM), a recovery and movement cost calculation method that identifies the impassable areas from the inclination angle and direction of utility pole obtained from the pole sensors installed on the upper part of the utility pole and the road data, and calculates the travel route and cost between the affected areas on the road excluding them. Based on the travel cost matrix between affected areas obtained by the proposed technology, patrol and recovery time is minimized. In this paper, we will describe the details of PACEM and evaluation results using optimization engine."

            "text": "In order to recover from failures such as broken wires and collapsed utility poles in the distribution\nnetwork, electric power companies generally take the following procedures [5].\n(1) Damage survey Check the status of the equipment and grasp the damage situation and the cause of the power outage. (2) Restoration of utility poles Emergency measures are taken by re-standing the broken utility pole vertically, aligning the pole with the pole and fixing it with metal fittings. The work of re-building utility poles mainly uses cranes called hole digging pillars and special vehicles with hole digging functions.\n(3) Restoration of electric wires By restoring high-voltage distribution lines, power outages over a wider area (areas without equipment\ndamage) will be restored. Aerial work platforms are mainly used for power line restoration work.\nIn the above procedure, the damage survey described in (1) is carried out by dispatching a patrol officer to the site. Based on the patrol results, the restoration work of utility poles and wires in (2) and (3) is carried out by a work group separate from the person in charge of patrol with special vehicles and specialized equipment.\nThe problem is that it takes a lot of time to carry out these restoration work and restore the power grid, therefore, technology to shorten the restoration time is required. Fig. 1 shows the history of recovery activities shown in the report [4] of the 2019 Typhoon No. 15 Response Verification Committee released by TEPCO HD in 2020 (this report is originally written in Japanese, however, we translated Fig. 1 is translated in English).\nIn the above-mentioned Typhoon No. 15, multiple press releases have been issued regarding the damage situation and recovery prospects, and the estimated recovery date has been extended with each release. The first restoration forecast was announced on September 10, the day after the disaster, and the remaining 120,000 power outages were announced during September 10, and they were targeted to be restored by September 11, but in reality, more than 500,000 power outages remained as of the end of September 10, indicating that information has not been correctly collected. The final expected restoration date was September 27, more than two weeks after the disaster, and on September 24, the restoration of power to consumers excluding some of the severely damaged areas was completed. According to the report, the power distribution restoration plan will be prepared at 10:00, 12 hours later of 22:00 on September 9, but\nAccording to the report, \"security patrols\" are first and foremost in restoration activities to confirm that there are no disconnections in distribution lines during power transmission. In line with this, it is stated that \"accident investigation\" to identify the accident location of power outage distribution lines at an early stage by remote control and \"equipment patrol\" to confirm the location of the accident at the site and conduct a field survey before full-scale restoration are carried out in parallel, and restoration work is being carried out sequentially for each point where the accident point is confirmed by the equipment patrol. From this, it can be seen that there is no clear rule to determine the recovery order, and that avail-able resources are invested as soon as an accident point is found.\nIt is difficult to accurately grasp the recovery process because the response to the accident is carried out haphazardly, however, according to the report, it takes more than one week to grasp the damage situation. On the other hand, since the failure point group where the failure location and situation were grasped was restored in 1 to 2 days, it took more than 2 weeks to restore the entire system because the recovery plan of which resources to invest at which failure point and at what timing was not properly implemented.\nConsidering the time from the occurrence of the accident to the recovery, it can be seen that it takes a long time to grasp the situation by facility patrol, pre-pare the recovery team, arrive at the accident site, and recover, respectively. As mentioned above, since the recovery team is dispatched as soon as a failure point is found, the phases of grasping the situation and recovery overlap in time, and it is difficult to make a clear calculation, but it takes about one week for each phase.\nAs reported in both phases, it took a lot of time to travel to the site. The in-crease of travel time has had a significant impact on the overall recovery time. In addition, the cause of increasing travel time is the disruption of roads due to the collapse of utility poles. In this study, we discuss how to shorten this travel time, and focus on the following three points.\n(1) Detecting the failure point without going to the site. Although it is possible to identify the area where a power outage occurs by re-porting from a customer or detecting it by a power distribution automation system, it is not difficult to identify which pole has a fault. If abnormalities on the utility pole basis can be detected from a remote location, it will be possible to identify the failure point without on-site equipment patrol.\n(2) Early recovery using independent operation using distributed power supply If the failure point can be identified by some means, power can be supplied as an independent operation\nwithout waiting for the restoration of the failure point, faster power recovery can be realized in some areas.\n(3) Minimizing the travel time of the recovery team Since the recovery team is dispatched to the site in the order in which the failure points are identified, longer travel distance greatly increase recovery time when they patrol multiple failure points and recover. If the failure point location can be identified at an early stage, it can be optimized as a cyclic problem.\nIn this study, the above (1), (2), and (3) and the collection and management of data in the event of a disaster required for these are considered. We have been studying and prototyping problem-solving methods for (3), We examined the formulation of a recovery plan to minimize the time for initial recovery. Specifically, we take care of the amount of resources required to recover each failure point, the start and end of recovery activities, and movement cost between each failure point. It is formulated as an optimization problem that takes items mentioned above as input and minimizes the time required to recover all failure points. By solving this, the recovery plan, that is, the order in which resources are input, is determined. Since infrastructure restoration in the event of a disaster is targeted, the cost required to move between each failure point is only the travel time, and fuel costs are not taken into account."

            "text": "As mentioned above, when considering travel time in the event of a disaster, it is necessary to take into account cases where the road is blocked by collapsed objects such as utility poles. If the recovery team is dispatched to the destination failure point without considering this case, the team that encounters a fallen utility pole will detour or turn back. This causes a large loss of travel distance.\nThe technology described in (1) of previous section can detect the inclination of utility poles based on the information obtained from the pole sensor installed on the top of the utility pole. For this purpose, we need to install sensors on utility poles. This sensor needs to send data even when utility poles or power line is damaged. Therefore, it should have two features. Firstly. the sensor should work by battery with low-power consuming. Secondry, sensors can send data with wireless communication. There exit such kind of sensors in commercial use [6].\nIt is also possible to obtain coordinates and directions in the same way, which makes it possible to know in which direction and how much distance the utility pole protrudes when it collapses. On the other hand, by extracting road data from publicly available geographic information and judging overlap with the horizontal component of utility poles, it is possible to determine the impact of utility poles on roads, as shown in Fig. 2.\nOpenStreetMap (OSM) [7] is famous as a geographic information that is open to the public. OSM expresses a road as a collection of line segments as shown in Fig. 2. A way is defined as an array of nodes\ndetermine the overlap between utility poles and roads, as shown in the bottom of Fig. 3.\nWe explain the method of line segment intersection judging by Fig. 3. We define several vectors: Utility\npole vector (pole), road vector (road), vectors between the root of utility pole and both edge of the road\n, , and vectors between the start point of the road and both edges of the utility pole , . In this\nsituation,\n( \u00d7 ) ( \u00d7 ) < 0: \uff0c is located in opposite side (opposite sign) across\nand\n( \u00d7 ) ( \u00d7 ) < 0: \uff0c is located in opposite side (opposite sign) across\n(operator \u00d7 is a cross product (vector product))\nthen, utility road and pole are crossing [8].\nFor this purpose, we assume that we can precisely detect position of utility poles because we need to\njudge whether a utility pole is located in which side of a road."

In the recovery order optimization, the recovery order of the failure points that maximizes the value of the objective function is obtained by formulating and solving the integer programming problem by giving the failure points and the start and end points of the recovery activities. What is set as the objective function is the power demand (recovery capacity) restored at time t, or the Even if the time at which all failure points are restored (the total power recovery capacity returns to the value before the failure) is the same or later, power is restored first in areas with high power recovery capacity, resulting in greater demand. can be met early, and the cumulative power recovery capacity is an index for measuring it. power recovery capacity, which is its time integral value.

(1) Determining the impact of utility poles on roads\nBased on direction and inclination data from pole sensors and geographic information, determine the impact on traffic (road blockage) caused by collapsed utility poles. Since the actual pole sensor data cannot be used in the evaluation, it is assumed that the tilt angle and direction data of the utility pole have been acquired, and the state of the utility pole is estimated from these and the original position of the pole. In addition, intersection judgment is performed using the method described in the previous section with the data expressing the road as a set of line segments connecting points, and road data where intersection occurs is extracted. Python was used to extract road information from the map data and implement the utility pole intersection detection program that detects intersection in the following steps:\n\u2022 Get map data from OpenStreetMap.\n\u2022 Extract road information (Path object with highway attribute) from map data\n\u2022 Search for the corresponding Node object from the Node id information contained in the above Path\nobject, and obtain the endpoint coordinates (latitude and longitude) of the line segment representing the road.\n\u2022 Extract a Path close to the latitude and longitude of the collapsed utility pole data prepared in advance\nfor testing.\n\u2022 For each extracted Path, determine whether it overlaps with the horizontal component of the utility\npole.\n\u2022 Judge as impassable and set the impassable attribute for paths that overlap more than half of the road\nwidth.\n(2) Calculation of travel cost between failure points Web-based services such as Google Maps [9] and Open Route Service [10] are available as means of finding the shortest route between two points and the required travel time. In the restoration plan this time, it is necessary to create a route that avoids sections that have become impassable due to utility poles. A route that avoids impassable areas is set from the GUI, and the travel time is calculated.\n(3) Creation of movement cost matrix among failure points Create a matrix of the travel costs obtained in (2) for all combinations between two points, including each\nfailure point and the start and end points of recovery activities.\nMovement cost matrix is used one of the inputs of restoration order optimization."

As a result of the study above, considering the impact of utility poles on roads, 20 to 30% of the time required for restoration can be expected. However, this effect varies greatly depending on the scale and degree of damage caused by the typhoon. Restoration workers also need to take breaks, and if restoration work is carried out for a predetermined period of time, the rest of the restoration work will be postponed to the next day. By reducing the time required for recovery by 20% to 30%, it becomes possible to bring forward the recovery work that was supposed to be carried out the next day, and to bring forward the date of restoration of power in the recovery plan, thus enabling early resumption of business activities. and can greatly contribute to the improvement of QoL of residents.\nThe proposed method uses the information from the pole-mounted sensors to identify the failure point without going to the site, and also checks the impact on the road based on the state of collapse of the utility pole itself, and determines whether there is an obstacle to vehicle traffic. It is also possible to know the location. As for formulating a recovery work plan to patrol failure points after a disaster occurs, it was necessary to wait for a report from the patrol team for several hours to a day in past day. The proposed technology makes it possible to formulate a recovery plan in about an hour. Furthermore, the recovery plan that was formulated was also based on the state of road closures due to collapsed utility poles, and the recovery work team dispatched to the site unexpectedly encountered collapsed utility poles and turned back or detoured largely at the site's discretion. It is possible to avoid such situation. Calculations based on information from 2019 Typhoon No. 15 indicate that the time required for this restoration work will be between one and one and a half days. It is believed that the application of this technology will make it possible to restore power grid failures in about two days, which used to take about two weeks after an outage occurred."
