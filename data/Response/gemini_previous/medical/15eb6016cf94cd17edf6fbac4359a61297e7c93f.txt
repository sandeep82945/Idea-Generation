1. **Investigate the role of immunosuppressive diseases in the development of clinical leptospirosis in cats.** This could be done by conducting a case-control study comparing cats with clinical leptospirosis to cats without clinical leptospirosis, and examining the prevalence of immunosuppressive diseases in each group.


2. **Determine the duration of Leptospira shedding in the urine of cats.** This could be done by conducting a longitudinal study of cats with leptospirosis, and collecting urine samples at regular intervals to test for the presence of Leptospira DNA.


3. **Evaluate the efficacy of different antibiotics for treating leptospirosis in cats.** This could be done by conducting a clinical trial comparing the efficacy of different antibiotics in treating cats with leptospirosis.


4. **Develop a vaccine to protect cats from leptospirosis.** This could be done by identifying the most common Leptospira serovars that infect cats, and then developing a vaccine that targets these serovars.


5. **Conduct a seroprevalence study of Leptospira in cats in different regions of the world.** This would help to determine the global distribution of Leptospira infection in cats, and to identify areas where cats are at high risk of infection.
