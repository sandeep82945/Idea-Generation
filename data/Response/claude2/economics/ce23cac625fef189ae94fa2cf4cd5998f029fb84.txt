 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Examine the impact of different types of stakeholders (e.g. customers, investors, employees) on opportunity co-creation and entrepreneurial performance of the poor. The current study focused only on government stakeholders, but including other stakeholders could provide additional insights. 

2. Investigate the role of entrepreneurial self-efficacy as a mediator between opportunity co-creation and entrepreneurial actions/performance. Entrepreneurial self-efficacy may help explain how opportunity co-creation builds confidence and promotes entrepreneurial behavior.

3. Explore the moderating effects of individual factors like entrepreneurial experience, education level, and personality traits on the relationship between opportunity co-creation and entrepreneurial performance. These factors may strengthen or weaken the impact of opportunity co-creation.

4. Conduct cross-cultural comparative studies on opportunity co-creation and entrepreneurial performance between poor entrepreneurs in different countries. This could identify differences based on economic or cultural contexts. 

5. Develop and test interventions, like entrepreneurial training programs, that could enhance opportunity co-creation capabilities and behaviors among poor entrepreneurs. Examining their impact on opportunity beliefs, actions, and performance could have practical implications.
