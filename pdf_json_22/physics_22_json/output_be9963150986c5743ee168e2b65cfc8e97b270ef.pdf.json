    "abstractText": "Understanding the microscopic mechanism of the transition of glass remains one of the most challenging topics in Condensed Matter Physics. What controls the sharp slowing down of molecular motion upon approaching the glass transition temperature Tg, whether there is an underlying thermodynamic transition at some finite temperature below Tg, what the role of cooperativity and heterogeneity are, and many other questions continue to be topics of active discussions. This review focuses on the mechanisms that control the steepness of the temperature dependence of structural relaxation (fragility) in glass-forming liquids. We present a brief overview of the basic theoretical models and their experimental tests, analyzing their predictions for fragility and emphasizing the successes and failures of the models. Special attention is focused on the connection of fast dynamics on picosecond time scales to the behavior of structural relaxation on much longer time scales. A separate section discusses the specific case of polymeric glass-forming liquids, which usually have extremely high fragility. We emphasize the apparent difference between the glass transitions in polymers and small molecules. We also discuss the possible role of quantum effects in the glass transition of light molecules and highlight the recent discovery of the unusually low fragility of water. At the end, we formulate the major challenges and questions remaining in this field.",

            "text": "Glass transition is a transition from a liquid to a solid state upon cooling without crystallization. There are many liquids that can be easily supercooled below their melting temperature Tm and will form a solid glassy state at the corresponding glass transition temperature Tg. The latter is defined as the temperature at which the structural relaxation time \u03c4\u03b1 reaches ~102\u2013103 s. In that respect, the transition at Tg is not a phase transition but has a kinetic origin, i.e., marks the transition to a nonequilibrium state when the structural relaxation rate becomes comparable to the experimental cooling rate. Despite many decades of studies, understanding the microscopic mechanism of the sharp increase in \u03c4\u03b1 or viscosity \u03b7 upon approaching the glass transition remains a great challenge [1\u20136]. This understanding is of critical importance not only for the field of glass transition but also for many other areas, including general Soft Matter Physics and Biophysics. Glass transition can be considered as a \u2018model phenomenon\u2019 that provides a microscopic picture of complex dynamics with significant cooperativity and dynamic heterogeneity in molecular motions. Understanding the dynamics of glass-forming systems can be extrapolated to even more complex systems (e.g., proteins). In all liquids at high enough temperatures, the viscosity \u03b7(T) or structural relaxation time \u03c4\u03b1(T) exhibit Arrhenius behavior with some constant activation energy E\u221e. At lower temperatures, however, they exhibit super-Arrhenius behavior: \u03b7(T) and/or \u03c4\u03b1(T) change\nEntropy 2022, 24, 1101. https://doi.org/10.3390/e24081101 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/entropy\nEntropy 2022, 24, 1101 2 of 44\nmuch faster than they would for a simple Arrhenius law (Figure 1), reflecting an increase in the activation energy for structural relaxation. The deviation from the Arrhenius behavior is highly dependent on the liquid and is usually weak for covalent bonding systems (e.g., SiO2) and strong for Van der Waals (VdW) liquids (e.g., trisnaphtyl benzene) (Figure 1). The degree of non-Arrhenius behavior is characterized by the steepness of the temperature variation of \u03b7(T) or \u03c4\u03b1(T) at Tg. It is traditionally called fragility [1,7,8] and is defined as:\nm = d log \u03b7 dTg/T \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 T=Tg\n(1)\nThe fragility (steepness) index m reflects the apparent activation energy at Tg (with a coefficient ln10) normalized by Tg. We note that different behaviors of viscosities as a function of Tg/T were discussed initially by Oldekop, W. [9]. The classification of glass formers according to the rate of the increase in the viscosity close to the glass transition was also suggested by Nemilov, S. [10]. The Tg-scaled Arrhenius plot was reintroduced by Laughlin and Uhlmann [11]. However, the notion of fragility and its definition (Equation (1)) were introduced by A. Angell, and he showed its fundamental importance in supercooled liquids and glass transition [7,8]. With a decreasing temperature, the viscosity of liquids increases from the universal high temperature limit \u03b7\u221e of about 10\u22124 Poise [1,12,13] to ~1013 Poise at Tg. If it exhibited Arrhenius behavior all the way from the high temperatures to Tg, this would correspond to the lowest possible fragility of m0 = 17. The lowest known fragility, however, is m~18\u201322 and is found in covalent bonding systems SiO2 and BeF2 [1,5]. It means that, even in these liquids, the temperature dependence of \u03b7(T) or \u03c4\u03b1(T) does not show purely Arrhenius behavior. VdW and ionic liquids exhibit much higher fragility of m~80\u2013100 [5], while many polymers have the highest fragility of m~150\u2013200 [5,6], showing an extremely steep non-Arrhenius temperature dependence of their structural (segmental) relaxation.

Thus, we\nwill not discuss it here.\n2.1. Semi-Empirical Equations Describing \u03c4\u03b1(T)\nThere are many phenomenological and empirical equations that describe well the\ntemperature variations of structural relaxation \u03c4\u03b1(T) or viscosity \u03b7(T) in a broad tempera-\nture range. The most traditional is the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) equation [16\u201318]:\n\u03c4() = \u03c40 exp[B/(T \u2212 T0)] (2)\nwhere \u03c40 is the high temperature limit of \u03c4, B and T0 are the material-dependent parame-\nters.

We emphasize that this puzzle is convoluted, with many fundamental questions of the glass transition effect, such as the extent of the collective dynamics and dynamical heterogeneity, decoupling of various dynamic processes, and connections between the slow and fast dynamics and between the elastic and thermodynamic properties in glass-forming materials. We attempt to address most of these questions in this review.

They can be divided into three main classes: free volume, entropic, and elastic models. Section 3 presents comparisons of experimental data to theoretical predictions. Although all approaches have some problems, they capture many peculiarities of the glass transition, and we attempt to find underlying connections between different approaches. Section 4 discusses a puzzling correlation between the dynamics on a picosecond time scale and the fragility of glass-forming liquids and attempts to formulate some general picture. Section 5 discusses the extremely high fragility of polymers and the role of intramolecular degrees of freedom in their peculiar behavior. Section 6 discusses the possibility of extremely low fragility due to quantum effects and, in particular, focuses on the dynamics of water that exhibit unusually low fragility, m~14. Section 7 summarizes the discussion and emphasizes the major challenges in the field of glass transition."

Thus, the fragility increases as T0 is approaching Tg. In some glass formers (polymers, hydrogenbonding materials, and room temperature ionic liquids), a single VFT function fits the experimental data fairly well in the entire temperature range. However, in most molecular liquids, two different VFT functions (one at a higher T and another at a lower T) are needed to describe \u03b7(T) or \u03c4(T) over the entire temperature range [20].\nEntropy 2022, 24, 1101 4 of 44\nSeveral other three-parameter empirical functions have been proposed to describe \u03c4\u03b1(T). Avramov and Milchev [21] proposed a model based on thermally activated atomic hopping over barriers with a distribution of barrier heights to justify the empirically found dependence [22\u201324]:\nlog\u03c4\u03b1 = log\u03c40 + B/T\u03b1 (5)\nIn this model, m = \u03b1m0 (6)\nThus, the exponent \u03b1 changes from 1 to >8 for various glass formers. As it is typical for the three-parameter models, this fitting function gives a good fit only in a limited temperature range of supercooled liquids. Mauro et al. recently suggested a model [25] explaining another three-parameter function, which was first proposed to fit the experimental viscosity data [26]. It is based on the temperature dependence of the configurational entropy, which is associated with the topological degrees of freedom per atom. For a simple two-state model, they obtained a double-Arrhenius expression for the \u03b1-relaxation time:\nlog(\u03c4\u03b1/\u03c40) = K T\nexp (\nE T\n) (7)\nIn the Mauro model, the fragility is determined by the second activation energy E:\nm = m0 (1 + E/Tg) (8)\nThe larger E is in comparison with Tg, the higher the fragility. Recently, R\u00f6ssler and coworkers suggested another effective three-parameter function\nthat describes \u03c4\u03b1 in liquids over a broad temperature range [27]. They assumed that the total activation energy is the sum of two contributions: E(T) = E\u221e + Ecoop(T). E\u221e is the hightemperature activation energy, which does not vary with T, while the activation energy of cooperative relaxation, Ecoop(T), is assumed to vary exponentially with T:\nEcoop(T) \u221d exp[\u2212\u03bb(T/TA \u2212 1)] (9)\nHere, TA has the meaning of the temperature above which the relaxation time is purely Arrhenius with the activation energy E\u221e. This corresponds to the four-parameter function:\nlog(\u03c4\u03b1/\u03c40) = E\u221e + a exp(\u2212\u03bb(T/TA \u2212 1)\nT (10)\nAt sufficiently low T, T << TA/\u03bb, this function predicts the Arrhenius temperature dependence of \u03c4\u03b1. Comparison with the experimental data showed that most molecular and hydrogen-bonded systems have a \u223c= E\u221e and TA = 0.104E\u221e, effectively reducing the number of the parameters to three. The fragility is equal to\nm = m0 + \u03bb(m0Tg \u2212 E\u221e)/TA (11)\nIt is important to emphasize that the VFT (or WLF) function predicts the divergence of the relaxation time at some finite temperature T0, suggesting an underlying phase transition at T below Tg. However, Equations (5), (7) and (10) predict that the relaxation time will not diverge at any finite temperature, and no phase transition is required. This is a longstanding question that still remains unresolved: Is the apparent divergence of \u03c4\u03b1(T) real, and is there an ideal glass transition at a finite temperature T0, or is this divergence a fictitious consequence of the approximations made? A recent analysis of 42 supercooled liquids close to the glass transition claimed no experimental basis for the dynamical divergence of the VFT form [28]. In Ref. [29], 20 million-year-old amber was investigated by a calorimetric and stress relaxation experiment. The authors found that there were no signatures of a\nEntropy 2022, 24, 1101 5 of 44\ndiverging timescale below Tg. The analysis of the relaxation time data for 67 glass formers using the universal parabolic law for the activation energy [30] led the authors to the same conclusion. Recently, a second derivative analysis of the temperature dependence of structural relaxation was proposed to address this point [31]. If structural relaxation has an Arrhenius temperature dependence, then the second derivative, d2(ln[\u03c4\u03b1])/d2(1/T), must be equal to zero [31]. This analysis revealed that, indeed, for many systems, the second derivative is close to zero at a high T, reflecting the well-known high-temperature Arrhenius behavior, and then go through a maximum and decreases towards zero as Tg is approached, as is shown for salicylic acid (salol) in Figure 2.\nEntropy 2022, 24, x FOR PEER REVIEW 5 of 48 transition at T below Tg.

The disadvantage of this model is that the free volume is not a well-defined parameter, especially in the case of covalent- and hydrogen-bonded materials.

In comparison with the VFT function, the Cohen and Grest (CG) equation for \u03b7 has an additional parameter: \u03b1. The CG function turns into VFT in the limiting case when \u03b1\u2192 0 and TCG = T0. The ratio \u03b1/Tg for various glass formers is rather small, ~0.01 \u00f7 0.1 [38]. The function Equation (14) describes \u03b7 and \u03c4 very well over the entire temperature range, even for the systems in which a single VFT approximation failed [39]. The corresponding fragility is equal to\nm = Tgm20 B 1 + m0\u03b1/4B\n1 + m20\u03b1Tg/4B 2\n(15)\nWe note that the naive free volume theory predicts the divergence of \u03c4\u03b1 at T0, but the more elaborated free volume theory of Cohen and Grest [39] predicts no divergence of the structural relaxation time. An analysis of the second derivative of the temperature variations of the structural relaxation time reveals that the Cohen and Grest model is the only one that can describe the observed maximum (Figure 2) [31]."

            "text": "The importance of the mechanical modulus in structural relaxation was discussed by Nemilov [13,40]. A more complex elastic model, the so-called shoving model proposed by Dyre [41\u201343], emphasizes that the act of molecular rearrangement\u2014a barrier crossing or a flow event\u2014takes a very short time in itself. Therefore, during such a process, the environment behaves as an elastic solid, and the infinite frequency shear modulus must be of primary importance for such a barrier crossing. Two types of expressions follow from this theory. The first relates the activation energy of the structural relaxation to the infinite frequency shear modulus G\u221e(T) [40,43,44]:\nlog(\u03c4\u03b1(T)/\u03c40) = G\u221e(T)V0\nT (16)\nwhere V0 is of the order of molecular volume that is assumed to be temperature-independent. Actually, there is no solid justification why V0 should be temperature-independent. It may change, at least as the inverse density. The shear modulus appears in the activation energy, since the molecular rearrangement leading to the breaking of a cage corresponds to purely shear displacements. With a decrease in the temperature in supercooled liquid, G\u221e(T) increases, which leads to a super-Arrhenius behavior of viscosity and structural relaxation time. This qualitatively corresponds to the behavior of the activation energy of supercooled liquids. As discussed in Ref. [45], the shear modulus G\u221e is related to the mean-squared atomic displacement (MSD), \u3008u2\u3009, on the time scales of the plateau of the intermediate scattering function, i.e., between the average molecular collision time and the structural relaxation\nEntropy 2022, 24, 1101 7 of 44\ntime. In particular, for a simple Maxwell model in combination with a Langevin model for Brownian motion, one obtains [46]:\n\u3008u2(T)\u3009 = 2T/\u03c0RG\u221e (17)\nwhere R denotes the particle radius. Thus, the ratio of the high-frequency elastic constant to the temperature in (16) may be replaced by the inverse MSD. This leads to another relation, proposed by the elastic theory of relaxation in supercooled liquids:\nlog(\u03c4\u03b1(T)/\u03c40) = \u03bba2\n\u3008u2(T)\u3009 (18)\nwhere a is the average intermolecular distance, and \u03bb~1 is a constant. Such a type of relation was also obtained in Refs. [47\u201353]. The fragility in the elastic model is equal to\nm = m0Tg (ln\u3008u2\u3009) \u2032\u2223\u2223\u2223\nT=Tg (19)\nor m = m0 [ 1\u2212 Tg ( (ln G\u221e) \u2032 + (ln V0) \u2032 ))\n]|T=Tg (20)\nIt means that the fragility is defined by the relative temperature variation of \u3008u2\u3009 or G\u221e and, in principle, V0."

            "text": "One of the most-recognized models for glass transition is the Adam\u2013Gibbs (AG) model [54], which is based on the role of configuration entropy and cooperativity in structural relaxation in liquids. In this model, the activation energy is expressed in terms of the configuration entropy Sc. The AG model assumes that the relaxation events are cooperative and occur in cooperatively rearranging regions (CRR). It is assumed that the number of configurations Nc available for each CRR is constantly independent of the size of the CRR. Then, if the number of molecules in each CRR is n and the total number of molecules is N, the number of CRRs is N/n, and the configuration entropy per molecule is Sc ~ (1/N)log NcN/n ~ sc/n, where sc = kBlogNc = const is usually equal to kBln2. The AG model also assumes that the activation energy of the structural relaxation is proportional to the CRR size n; thus, Eact \u221d n \u221d 1/Sc. As a result,\nlog \u03c4(T)/\u03c40 = B\nTSc(T) (21)\nwhere B = \u2206\u00b5sc, is a constant, and \u2206\u00b5 is the energy barrier for individual particle relaxation (no cooperativity). This model describes many experimental (e.g., [55\u201358]) and computer simulations (e.g., [59\u201361]) results. Note that some model assumptions, such as that the CRRs are independent and equivalent, the number of accessible configurations is constant, and the activation energy is proportional to the size of the CRR, are not well-justified [62]. Nevertheless, the AG model leads to the thermodynamic expression for fragility:\nm = m0\n( 1 + TgS\u2032c ( Tg ) Sc ( Tg ) ) (22)\nwhere Sc\u2019(Tg) is the temperature derivative of Sc(T) at Tg. The AG model assumes that, upon cooling, Sc(T) vanishes at some TK, called the Kauzmann temperature. This scenario explicitly assumes the underlying phase transition at TK, where the configurational entropy must vanish. It also predicts the behavior for Sc(T):\nSc(T) = \u2206cp ln(T/TK) \u2248 \u2206cp(T \u2212 TK)/T. (23)\nEntropy 2022, 24, 1101 8 of 44\nwhere \u2206cp(T) is the difference of the specific heat between the supercooled liquid and crystalline states. In this approximation, the AG model turns into the VFT function for \u03c4\u03b1(T) with T0 = TK. Indeed, in many cases, T0~TK, but there are supercooled liquids where this rule is significantly violated [63]. With this approximation of Sc(T), Equation (22) gives\nm = m0\n1\u2212 TK/Tg (24)\nAlternatively, (22) can be presented as a function of the specific heat jump at Tg:\nm = m0\n( 1 + \u2206cp Sc ( Tg )) (25)\nA similar relationship between m and \u2206cp was derived within the random first-order (RFOT) or mosaic theory of the glass transition [64\u201367]. Contrary to the Adam\u2013Gibbs model, the CRR in RFOT can access many configurational states. However, this number is limited by the surface energy needed to compensate for the mismatch between different configurations of the CRR. The surface energy is determined by the surface tension \u03c3 and the surface area, which, in a simple 3D case, is proportional to R2. In a more general sense, \u03c3 is considered as a generalized surface tension, and the surface energy is \u03c3R\u03b8 , where \u03b8 \u2264 2 is an exponent reflecting the complex topography of the surface. The free energy cost to create a CRR of the radius R is then similar to the case of conventional nucleation:\n\u2206F = \u03c3R\u03b8 \u2212 TScR3 (26)\nThe balance of two driving forces determines the characteristic sizes of the rearranging regions \u03be:\n\u03be =\n( \u03c3\nTSc\n) 1 3\u2212\u03b8\n\u221d 1\n(T \u2212 TK)1/(3\u2212\u03b8) (27)\nRFOT assumes the free energy barrier scales with the size of the rearranging region as\nE \u221d \u03be\u03c8 (28)\nQualitatively, this is similar to the Adam\u2013Gibbs relation, \u03be3 \u221d 1/Sc. However, RFOT predicts a stronger dependence of the CRR size on Sc. In particular, if \u03be scales are the size of the critical nucleus, where \u2206F (26) is the maximum, then \u03c8 = \u03b8. For \u03b8 = 2 (2D surface), \u03be \u221d 1/Sc and E \u221d 1/Sc2. The theory does not predict the exact values of the exponents \u03c8 and \u03b8, but they should obey the inequality \u03b8 \u2264 \u03c8 \u2264 d \u2212 1 [68]. The VFT behavior basically corresponds to \u03b8 = 3/2 case. Actually, this value of the exponent in Equation (28) was obtained in Refs. [64,65,69] on the basis of the renormalization group arguments. The approximation Sc(T)~\u2206cp(T \u2212 TK)/T and the Lindemann criterion of melting provide the VFT behavior [65]:\n\u2206F/T = DTk\nT \u2212 Tk (29)\nwith D = 32R/\u2206cp. (30)\nwhere R is the gas constant. The parameter D is equivalent to B/T0 in the VFT function (2) and also characterizes the fragility. It is connected to the usual fragility m as\nm = m0 + 2.3 m02/D (31)\nThe generalized entropy theory of glass formation in polymers (ETGF) [45,70,71] combines the lattice cluster theory (extended to allow for different rigidities of the chain backbone and side groups) with the Adam\u2013Gibbs [54] and Gibbs\u2013DiMarzio [72] theories\nEntropy 2022, 24, 1101 9 of 44\nof glass transition. It predicts systematic changes in the fragility with the chain stiffness, cohesive energy, length of the polymer chain, and of the side chain. One of the important parameters of the theory is the relative rigidity of the chain backbone and the side groups, which strongly affects the fragility. The generalized entropy theory predicts the \u03c4\u03b1(T) in the entire temperature range. In particular, at intermediate temperatures, it predicts the scaling, proposed by R\u00f6ssler [73], log\u03c4\u03b1 = f (Tc/T \u2212 1). As other entropic models, ETGF predicts the divergence of the relaxation time at some finite temperature TK. The authors actually admit that this result may be an artifact of the mean field approximation [71]. ETGF also reproduces approximate relationship between isothermal compressibility \u03baT and configurational entropy Sc, as in the Salzman\u2013Schweizer theory [74\u201376] (will be discussed below). Under the additional assumption that 1/\u03baT \u221d G\u221e, as argued in Ref. [45], ETGF reproduces the idea of the elastic theory of the relaxation in supercooled liquids with Eact = G\u221eV. Comparing with the Adam\u2013Gibbs expression (Equation (21)), the authors of Ref. [45] obtained the relation between configuration entropy and MSD: ScT \u221d \u3008u2\u3009. The same scaling for landscape configurational entropy and MSD was suggested as a result of molecular dynamic simulations [77]. Thus, EGTF attempts to reveal a possible connection between entropic and elastic models of the relaxation in supercooled liquids. To reveal this connection, Wyart [78] argued that if the relationship between relaxation time and MSD (18) exists, then there is a relationship between fragility and vibrational entropy, which leads to m = 52\u2206Cvib/3\u03b1, where \u03b1 is a numerical parameter, which reflects the frequency dependence of the anharmonicity. An increase in \u3008u2\u3009 due to the softening of low-frequency vibrational modes (boson peak, see description below) can significantly affect the temperature dependence of \u03c4\u03b1. This idea was further developed [79] for materials with a rigidity transition, and a possible connection of fragility to the elastic properties of the liquid and to the boson peak was revealed."

            "text": "Salzman and Schweizer [74,75] combined the methods of the mode coupling, density functional, and activated hopping transport theories to extend the mode-coupling theory to the activated hopping regime in the temperature range down to Tg. They used coarse graining and condensed all the specific materials\u2019 chemistry to a few parameters, such as dimensionless compressibility S0 and packing p. An important parameter of the theory is the MCT-like critical temperature Tc, below which activated hopping begins to affect the dynamics. Following the empirical findings [49], the theory assumes that, at Tc, the segmental relaxation time has a universal value of ~10\u22127 s. Salzman and Schweizer show that log\u03c4\u03b1(T) scales are a universal function of [(Tc/T \u2212 1)/(Tc/Tg \u2212 1)]\u2206, the scaling previously proposed by R\u00f6ssler et al. [73] based on experimental studies. The origin of the scaling behavior is the critical power\u2013law growth of the collective barrier. The dynamic fragility in this theory can be expressed in terms of the Tc/Tg ratio:\nm = b\n1\u2212 Tg/Tc (32)\nwhere b \u2248 14 \u00b1 2 for \u03c4(Tc) = 10\u22127\u00b11 s and \u03c4(Tg) = 100 s. A similar result was obtained in the model of percolation of solid-like clusters [80]. The density, the entropic contribution to the dimensionless compressibility A, and the temperature independent cooperativity factor ac are critical parameters in the Salzman and Schweizer theory that determine the Tc/Tg ratio and fragility. The cooperativity factor ac is not a priori predicted by the theory but has the meaning of the number of dynamically correlated segments along the chain and is usually assumed to be ac = 2 \u00f7 5. In this respect, fragilities 60\u201370 correspond to a small collective factor ac~1, i.e., flexible polymers, while polymers with stiff backbones, bulky side groups, or polar monomers have large ac and fragilities m~100\u2013180. However, the theory is a single particle mean field approximation. Collective effects cannot be estimated within this version of the theory.\nEntropy 2022, 24, 1101 10 of 44\nMirigian and Schweizer explicitly took into account the collective effects in the next improved version of the theory [81\u201383]. They included the collective effects associated with long-range elastic distortion of the liquid into the elastically collective nonlinear Langevin equation (ECNLE) theory. The theory is applied to hard sphere fluids [82] and thermal liquids [83]. The chemical complexity of the thermal liquids is taken into account by nanometer scale coarse graining and mapping to a hard sphere fluid with some packing fraction, which reproduces the experimental dimensionless compressibility S0 of the specific system, S(k\u21920) \u2261 S0 = \u03c1kBT\u03baT \u221d\u3008(\u03b4\u03c1)2\u3009, where S(k) is the static structure factor, \u03baT is the compressibility, and \u03c1 is particle density [83]. In the case of polymers, the ECNLE theory uses the same mapping approach at the Kuhn segment scale [84\u201386]. The theory predicts that, in the high-temperature regime, when the collective effects are negligible, log(\u03c4\u03b1/\u03c40) \u221d S0\u22121. At low temperatures, where the collective effects due to cooperative elastic distortions that arise in the course of cage breaking become significant, log(\u03c4\u03b1/\u03c40) \u221d S0\u22123. The theory identifies S0 as the key \u2018thermodynamic order parameter\u2019 for all the activated regimes. The latter scaling includes both the cage and elastic barrier contributions. In this regime, the two barriers exhibit a nontrivial \u2018compensation effect\u2019 [87] in their contribution to the total barrier, resulting in a predicted cubic power law. Additionally, in this deeply supercooled regime, the equivalent representation is log(\u03c4\u03b1/\u03c40) \u221d \u03c33G/T, where \u03c3 is the molecular size, and G is the dynamically relaxed high-frequency elastic shear modulus. This result is similar to the prediction of the shoving model [43], but here, it arises on the basis of a different mechanism. In Refs. [86,88], the predictions of the theory are compared to the experimental results for \u03b1-relaxation time in glass formers of different chemical compositions, fragility, and in different temperature ranges. It is shown that the high-temperature renormalized Arrhenius scaling of log(\u03c4\u03b1/\u03c40) vs. S0\u22121 applies over ~1.5\u20133 decades, roughly double or more the range that classic Arrhenius behavior applies. The interval is longer in less fragile systems, e.g., in glycerol in comparison with salol and toluene. At low temperatures, \u03b1-relaxation time scales with S0\u22123, and the interval of the scaling is longer in more fragile systems, reaching, e.g., ~14 decades in toluene, ~15 in sorbitol, and about 7 decades in glycerol. A master curve was constructed as a superposition of the high- and low-temperature regimes with the help of an adjustable dimensionless weight parameter w that captures the noncooperative-to-cooperative crossover:\nlog(\u03c4\u03b1/\u03c40) = w(S0(Tg)/S0(T)) +(1 \u2212 w) (S0(Tg)/S0(T))3 (33)\nThe authors found that the parameter w correlates very well with the fragility, ln (1/w) = 0.0493(m \u2212 42.48) [88]. Since w \u2265 0, it can be concluded that the collective elasticity effects are irrelevant for materials with fragility less than 41.5, such as boron oxide and silica. Another approach describing glass transition is the frustration-limited domain theory [89,90]. This theory assumes the existence of a locally preferred structure that is different from the structure of the respective crystal. The theory is based on the presence of frustration in the structures of liquids. This means that the preferable local order cannot be extended over long distances, and thus, frustration appears on some mesoscopic length scale, and a mosaic pattern of domains occurs. The domains are separated by interfaces with a higher concentration of defects. Cooperative dynamics in the domains leads to a super-Arrhenius temperature dependence of the structural relaxation at sufficiently low temperatures. This theory predicts that fragility depends on frustration, because larger frustration means a smaller collectively relaxing domain size that corresponds to a lower fragility. Scaling arguments lead to the following expression for the activation energy in the frustration-limited domain theory: E(T) = E\u221e + \u2206E(T), where:\n\u2206E(T) = {\n0, T > TA BTA(1\u2212 T/TA)y\n(34)\nEntropy 2022, 24, 1101 11 of 44\nHere, TA, y, and B are fitting parameters that provide a good description of the experimental data. TA is higher than the melting temperature Tm and corresponds to the temperature above which the Arrhenius regime dominates. The exponent y was obtained in the range 7/3 \u00f7 3 for different materials with a typical value of 8/3. The factor B describes the degree of frustration\u2014the higher frustration, the lower the B. The fragility, estimated with the activation energy (34) is equal to\nm = m0 + By(1 \u2212 Tg/TA)y (35)\nThus, increasing the frustration in the molecular arrangements leads to decreasing the fragility. Another theory of the glass transition is based on the ideas of dynamical facilitation [91]. In simple words, the latter takes into account the fact that the elementary structural relaxation events in supercooled liquids are comparatively reared on a molecular time scale, and in a local region where such event occurs, the probability of the relaxation of nearby molecules increases. In this approach, it is not geometry but, rather, local mobility that is central for the theory. There are many realizations of the dynamical facilitation scenario in various models [91,92], where the local kinetics are constrained by various conditions. Elmatad, Chandler, and Garrahan [30] obtained a very simple and universal expression for the structural relaxation time in a class of kinetically constrained models:\nlog(\u03c4/\u03c40) = (J/T0)2(T0/T \u2212 1)2, T0 > T > Tx (36)\nThe temperatures T0 and Tx determine the applicability of Formula (36). T0 is a high temperature at which the concentration c of excitations that facilitate the local mobility is so high that no correlated motion is required. It has the meaning of the onset of glassy dynamics. The temperature Tx is low enough that the super-Arrhenius rate related to the constrains becomes so small that the molecule would prefer to avoid the constrains, although at some energy cost. Therefore, below Tx, \u03c4\u03b1 will eventually return to the Arrhenius dependence. The predicted parabolic law (Equation (36)) is explained by the logarithmic dependence of the activation energy E for relaxation of the domain on its size \u03be. The latter depends on c, e.g., \u03be3 \u221d c in three dimensions. Since c is described by the Boltzmann distribution, logc \u221d log\u03be \u221d E \u221d 1/T. It has been shown that the three-parameter parabolic Equation (36) describes well the experimental data in 67 glass formers with high and intermediate fragility down to Tg [30]. This model has also been tested in extensive molecular dynamic simulations of five distinct simple liquid mixtures [93]. The fragility in this model is basically determined by the ratio J/T0, where the parameter J has the meaning of the energy scale for the excitations of the correlated dynamics:\nm = 2(J/Tg)2(1 \u2212 Tg/T0) (37)\nSince Equation (36) is not applicable at sufficiently high T, it is impossible to put log(\u03c4(Tg)/\u03c40) equal to m0 and, thus, reduce the number of parameters in Equation (37), as it was, e.g., in the VFT case. We want to emphasize the essential difference between this model and the Adam\u2013 Gibbs approach. The latter assumes domains of collective relaxations, CRR, that increase in size upon cooling, while, in the dynamical facilitation picture, the main object is the elementary excitations with temperature-independent sizes. With the decreasing T, their concentration decreases, and the distance between the excitations increases. This leads to an increase in the dynamical heterogeneity length scale. It is not clear whether both pictures may be connected.\nEntropy 2022, 24, 1101 12 of 44"

            "heading": "3.2. Role of Cooperativity/Heterogeneity",
            "text": "The key in the entropic models is the assumption of the increase in cooperativity of structural relaxation upon approaching Tg. These models implicitly relate higher fragility to higher molecular cooperativity at Tg [54]. Attempts to experimentally test this relationship remain at the center of many studies. The largest challenge here is how to measure cooperativity in structural relaxation. There is no accepted definition and no direct experimental measure of the cooperativity. In many cases, one can measure the length scale of dynamic heterogeneity \u03be, and then, it is assumed that \u03be reflects the length scale of cooperativity. Although the analysis of MD simulations suggested some ways to differentiate the cooperativity and heterogeneity length scale [103], no consensus on this topic has been achieved so far. This remains one of the important questions in the field: How can we quantify the cooperativity, and how is it related to the length scale of dynamic heterogeneity? Several ideas have been proposed for measurements of the length scale of dynamic heterogeneity. First of all, it has been shown that the experimentally measured ensemble averaged two-point correlation functions (e.g., neutron or light scattering intensity, dielectric permittivity, etc.) cannot provide information on the dynamic heterogeneity, and measurements of higher order correlation functions are required [104,105]. Detailed discussion of this problem and of the recent results on this topic are presented in the book [105]. It is fairly easy to analyze the higher-order correlation functions in simulations where knowledge of the trajectories for all the atoms at any time provides a possibility to calculate any correlation functions. The traditional focus is on four-point correlation functions [106] that measure the extent of dynamical heterogeneity, i.e., how the mobility of different particles in the media are correlated. Clearly, the mobility itself depends on the correlation of density at different points at different times, i.e., is a two-point correlation function. If the respective mobility for the i-particle is ci(t,0), then the mobility field is introduced as [106].\nc(r; t, 0) = \u2211 i ci(t, 0)\u03b4(r\u2212 ri) (39)\nThe four-point correlation function is defined through the spatial correlation of the mobility field:\nG4(r; t) = \u3008c(r; t, 0)c(0; t, 0)\u3009 \u2212 \u3008c (0; t, 0)\u30092 (40)\nThe time-dependent four-point susceptibility is\n\u03c74(t) = \u222b G4(r; t)dr (41)\n\u03c74(t) can be expressed via the fluctuation of density \u03b4\u03c1(r,t) = \u03c1(r,t) \u2212 \u03c10, where \u03c10 is the average density [107]:\n\u03c74(t) = \u222b\ndr1dr2[\u3008\u03b4$(r1, 0)\u03b4$(r2, 0)\u03b4$(r1, t)\u03b4$(r2, t)\u3009\u2212 \u3008\u03b4$(r1, 0)\u03b4$(r1, t)\u3009\u3008\u03b4$(r2, 0)\u03b4$(r2, t)\u3009]\n(42)\nAssuming a compact structure of the heterogeneities [106],\n\u03c74(t) \u221d Ncorr (43)\nwhere Ncorr is the number of particles in the dynamically correlated region. The first experimental attempts to measure the length of the dynamical heterogeneity were done with multidimensional NMR, where a particular sequence of pulses was designed to select a sub-ensemble of either the slowest or fastest relaxing units and watch their relaxation behaviors over time [108,109]. These studies clearly demonstrated the presence of dynamic heterogeneities in glass-forming liquids and also revealed that their lifetime is comparable to the average structural relaxation time [108,109]. In other words, the fastest relaxing regions might become the slowest and vice versa on the time scale ~(2 \u00f7 3)\u03c4\u03b1 [108,109]. Four-dimensional NMR has been used to estimate the length scale \u03be of dynamic hetero-\nEntropy 2022, 24, 1101 16 of 44\ngeneities in several materials [108,109]. It appears to be in the range \u03be~1.5\u20133 nm, but the accuracy of these estimates was not sufficient to provide any conclusions about their temperature variations or correlation to fragility. A detailed theoretical analysis suggested that the lower limit of \u03c74 can be estimated based on the analysis of the temperature variations of the two-point correlation function \u03c7T [110,111]. The latter can provide estimates of the number of dynamically correlated particles Ncorr. This approach has opened the way for the analysis of \u03c7T in many materials and has revealed that there is no divergence of the length scale upon cooling, which is expected in the case of the AG model. In contrast, Ncorr increases as a logarithmic law upon approaching Tg [111], and there is no correlation of Ncorr(Tg) and fragility [110,112]. Moreover, even temperature variations of Ncorr(T) appear rather similar for strong and fragile systems, as well as for classical computer simulation models (Figure 7). According to these studies, the correlation length \u03be changes by only ~20\u201330% when the liquid is cooled from Tm down to Tg (Figure 7) [111].\nEntropy 2022, 24, x FOR PEER REVIEW 17 of 48\nin several materials [108,109].

Data from [14,156].\nIt was shown [14] that, in multicomponent systems such as, e.g., lithium borate or\nsilicate glasses, fragility is higher than one can expect from Correlation (50) (Figure 17).\nLater, in Ref.

In other words, all points corresponding to multicomponent\nsystems would lie above the correlation line for chemically simple glasses (Figure 17).\nApparently, increased fragility is a characteristic feature of many-component liquids and\nmight be affected by the entropy of the mixture. A good example is decalin: the pure cis-\ndecalin has a fragility m ~ 60\u201370 [99,158], while the usual decalin is a mixture of approxi-\nmately 50\u201350 cis- and trans-components and has an anomalously high fragility of m ~ 146\n[159,160].\nConcluding Section 3, we want to emphasize that all three approaches, thermody-\nnamic, free volume, and elastic models, describe temperature variations in structural re-\nlaxation reasonably well, and all have some problems. The analysis of various experi-\nmental data clearly indicates the absence of the divergence of the characteristic length\nscale of cooperativity/heterogeneity expected in entropic models.

Connection between Fast and Slow Dynamics\nMany experimental studies revealed strong correlations of fast dynamics, even in the\nglassy state, with fragility of the liquid state [14,43,48,49,161,162,163]. This apparent con-\nnection between dynamics on the ps time scale and the temperature dependence of the\nstructural relaxation on the time scales of seconds and minutes remains a great puzzle\n[164] and is the focus of this section.\n4.1.

Stars show the B2O3\u2013Li2O mixture with different compositions and provides a clear illustration of the deviation in chemically complex systems. Data from [14,156].\nIt was shown [14] that, in multicomponent systems such as, e.g., lithium borate or silicate glasses, fragility is higher than one can expect from Correlation (50) (Figure 17). Later, in Ref. [157], the authors collected more data on multicomponent systems that confirm the same property\u2014in all these systems, fragility is always higher than expected according to Correlation (50). In other words, all points corresponding to multicomponent systems would lie above the correlation line for chemically simple glasses (Figure 17). Apparently, increased fragility is a characteristic feature of many-component liquids and might be affected by the entropy of the mixture. A good example is decalin: the pure cis-decalin has a fragility m~60\u201370 [99,158], while the usual decalin is a mixture of approximately 50\u201350 cis- and trans-components and has an anomalously high fragility of m~146 [159,160]. Concluding Section 3, we want to emphasize that all three approaches, thermodynamic, free volume, and elastic models, describe temperature variations in structural relaxation reasonably well, and all have some problems. The analysis of various experimental data clearly indicates the absence of the divergence of the characteristic length scale of cooperativity/heterogeneity expected in entropic models. This analysis also demonstrates that density is not the only parameter that controls structural relaxation, and a purely thermal contribution can dominate in some liquids, e.g., glycerol. Elastic models look attractive and easy to understand but require more microscopic justification."

A correlation of both parameters with fragility is shown in Figure 20. So far, there is no clear model connecting fragility and amplitude of the fast relaxation. A qualitative explanation can be formulated based on the contributions of vibrations and fast relaxation to the total MSD [161]: \u3008u2(T)\u3009 = \u3008u2(T)\u3009vib + \u3008u2(T)\u3009rel.

Fragility and Nonergodicity Parameter in Glassy State An interesting correlation between the high-frequency property of the glassy state\nand fragility of the liquid was found empirically in Ref. [163]. The authors analyzed the nonergodicity parameter f(Q,T) in the glassy state obtained from the intensity of the Brillouin lines, measured by inelastic X-ray scattering. In the low Q limit, the temperature dependence of f(Q,T) in the glassy state can be approximated by a simple relationship [163]: \ud835\udc53(\ud835\udc44 \u2192 0, \ud835\udc47) = 11 + \ud835\udefc \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47 (53)\nAn analysis of several glass-forming systems revealed [163] a good correlation between fragility of a liquid and the parameter \u03b1 that characterizes the temperature variation of f(Q,T) in the glassy state (Figure 21). Although some systems deviate from this correlation (CKN and B2O3 in Figure 21) [14,178], it is puzzling how the temperature dependence of the THz vibrational dynamics in glass can predict the temperature dependence of structural relaxation in a liquid. Essentially, it suggests that the nonergodicity parameter (the amplitude of the structural relaxation) at Tg, f0(Tg) ~ 1/(1 + \u03b1), correlates with the liquid fragility. In Ref. [14], the authors noted that the correlation of m and \u03b1 is connected to the above-discussed correlation between m and the Poisson\u2019s ratio of the respective glass. The parameter \u03b1 in some approximation can be expressed in terms of the ratio of the bulk and shear moduli of the glass or, equivalently, in terms of Poisson\u2019s ratio."

In contrast, in liquids without directional interactions (e.g., VdW and ionic systems), the shear rigidity appears mostly due to jamming and is very low (relative to the bulk modulus) at high T.

As a resu t, the activ tion e ergy of the struc ural relaxation increases trongly upon cooling, and th se liquids exhibit strong super-Arrhenius temperature behavior (high fragility). This picture is also consistent with the observed temperature variations in S(Q) [134]: these variations are very weak in strong systems, while they are significant in fragile glass-forming systems (Figure 9). It is not obvious how to connect this elasticity picture to change in the configurational entropy. In a simple na\u00efve picture, it seems obvious that more rigid systems (higher modulus) should have less accessible conformational states. Thus, the configurational entropy should vary much faster with the temperature in systems that exhibit strong temperature variations in G\u221e(T) than in systems where G\u221e is barely cha ging with T, a d there should be a conn ction between the entropic and elastic models. However, this connection is still not well-explored and understood. The same interatomic potential obviously determines the fast dynamics. Systems with direct bonds have better-defined positions of atoms and less frustration in their packing. This leads to a smaller amplitude of fast picosecond relaxation (rattling in the cage), i.e., to a smaller amplitude of 1-f 0 and, accordingly, to a larger nonergodicity parameter f 0. The latter determines the amplitude of the structural relaxation and, in particular, the amplitude of the elastic constant fluctuations that can be considered frozen on the time scale of the fast dynamics. This leads to an increase in th bos n peak ampli ude (relativ to the expected Debye model) in materials with higher f 0. In contrast, systems without direct bonds have much larger frustration in their packing and much higher amplitude of the rattling in the cage. This leads to a much lower f 0, a weaker boson peak, and a higher amplitude of the fast relaxation.\nEntropy 2022, 24, 1101 29 of 44\nThis consideration explains the connection between the relative contributions of the fast relaxation and the boson peak to fragility (Figures 16 and 17). It also relates both properties to the nonergodicity parameter f0. Moreover, it also explains well the correlation between the behavior of MSD and structural relaxation time with the temperature. According to the above picture, f 0(T) is large in liquids with direct bonds and does not change much with the temperature. As a result, G\u221e(T) also shows rather weak temperature variations. This leads to an almost Arrhenius behavior of \u03c4\u03b1(T), a strong boson peak, and a low amplitude of the fast relaxation. The data for B2O3 indeed show that the boson peak dominates the fast dynamics spectra of this relatively strong liquid even at temperatures of ~2.5Tg [180]. On the contrary, systems with no directional bonds have a lower value for f 0(T), which varies strongly with T. This leads to a strong variation in G\u221e(T), to a strongly non-Arrhenius behavior of \u03c4\u03b1(T), a weak boson peak, and a high amplitude of the fast relaxation. Data for the fragile system CKN show that fast relaxation dominates its fast dynamics spectra even at Tg, in full agreement with this scenario [161]. This qualitative consideration provides some simple picture connecting many pieces of the puzzle, including the role of elasticity, shear modulus, and interatomic interactions (directional/nondirectional) in fragility, the nonergodicity parameter, and fast dynamics of glass-forming systems."

The latter in polymers is called segmental relaxation [181]. Chain relaxation controls the viscosity, while glass transition is controlled by segmental relaxation. There is numerous experimental evidence that chain relaxation in polymers has a different temperature dependence than segmental dynamics [182]. Thus, it is incorrect to use polymer viscosity data to discuss the steepness of the temperature dependence of the structural (segmental) dynamics, and we will focus the next section on the discussion of segmental dynamics only."

            "text": "The fragility of small molecular systems usually does not exceed 100, while there are many polymers with m > 150 and even reaching m~200 [5,6]. Therefore, polymers exhibit extremely high fragility, significantly above the value of m typical for small molecules, and this fact deserves special discussion. The mechanism of extremely high fragility of polymers is apparently related to chain connectivity. In contrast to small molecules, polymers have an additional parameter that affects their structural dynamics\u2014the chain length, i.e., molecular weight (MW). The glass transition temperature increases strongly with the increase in MW for most of polymers with nonpolar chain ends. Detailed studies revealed that the fragility also increases with MW in most polymers [183\u2013186]. Very flexible polymers, such as poly(dimethyl siloxane) (PDMS) and polyisoprene (PIP), show a very weak increase of fragility with MW [183]. They also have a relatively weak change of Tg with MW [183]. However, polymers with a more rigid structure, such as polystyrene (PS) and poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), show a much stronger increase in the fragility with MW (Figure 22). This increase in the fragility with MW and its dependence on chain rigidity is captured by both ETGF and Schweizer\u2019s theory. We are aware of only two polymers where the fragility decreases with an increase in MW, polyisobutylene (PIB) [187], and poly(ethylene acrylate) (PEA) [188]. We want to stress that PIB actually shows many other unusual-for-polymers properties [187]. It has been demonstrated that correlations of fragility with various other material properties established for small molecules fail in the case of many (but not all) polymers. This includes the following correlations: (i) ln\u03c4 vs. 1/ScT [189], (ii) \u2206Cp vs. m (Figure 23), (iii) K/G (or vl/vt) vs. m (Figure 23), and (iv) non-ergodicity parameter vs. m (Figure 23). For example, it has been shown in [189] that ln\u03c4 follows variations of configurational entropy in flexible polymers, such as PDMS and PIP, while strong deviations appear in rigid polymers, such as PS and PMMA. The same seems to be true for the other listed\nEntropy 2022, 24, 1101 30 of 44\ncorrelations. It is interesting to note that, in most of these cases, the correlations hold for oligomers (very short chains) but fail progressively with the increasing molecular weight (Figure 23). The data for monomers and oligomers of the same polymers agree well with the correlations established for small molecules (Figure 23). However, the increase in MW in these polymers leads to a significant increase in m, while many other properties (e.g., K/G and nonergodicity) remain essentially not affected by the MW.\nEntropy 2022, 24, x FOR PEER REVIEW 33 of 48\nchain rigidity is captured by both ETGF and Schweizer\u2019s theory.

First of all, secondary relaxations are also known for small molecules, where the correlations hold. Second, the secondary relaxations exist in short and long polymers and show rather weak MW dependence. Thus, according to this idea, the failure of the correlations should not depend strongly on MW. This expectation clearly contradicts the experimental data (Figure 23). In contrast, the failure of the correlations might be explained by a strong increase in fragility due to some intramolecular polymer-specific mechanism that does not influence other properties. Indeed, polymers with a weak MW dependence of fragility (e.g., PIP, polybutadiene (PB), and PDMS) follow well the correlations established for small molecules. Only polymers with a strong increase in fragility with MW (e.g., PS and PMMA) deviate from these correlations, and we will discuss this point in more detail below."

            "text": "To understand the microscopic mechanisms specific for polymers with high fragility, let us discuss the qualitative picture proposed in [190] (Figure 24). Let us assume that the temperature dependence of \u03c4\u03b1(T) can be well-described by a single VFT. Then, the high-temperature behavior is expected to be rather independent of MW, because the chains are very flexible at a high T, and the chain length has little effect on the local segmental dynamics. In that case, the VFT parameters \u03c40 and B should have rather weak MW dependence, and the main change is caused by the effective MW dependence of T0(MW). In the case of flexible chains, the shift of T0 and Tg with MW is very small, while, in rigid chains, it will be very strong. As a result, flexible chains have a weak dependence of Tg and fragility on the MW, while rigid chains exhibit much a stronger dependence of both Tg and fragility on the molecular weight (Figure 25). This qualitative picture also suggests that segmental dynamics in polymers with different molecular weights should scale universally with T-Tg(MW).

The authors of [202] speculated that the observed difference in temperature scaling for chain and segmental relaxation can be explained by the fact that chains are not yet fully relaxed on the segmental relaxation time scale. This corresponds to the nonergodic behavior of polymers on this time scale, while the ergodicity is restored on the global molecular (chain) relaxation time scale. As a result, the configurational entropy that controls the segmental relaxation decreases with the cooling faster compared to the total configurational entropy that controls molecular-scale relaxation. Moreover, the fraction of configurational entropy that is not accessible on the time scale of segmental relaxation increases with the chain length, resulting in an observed increase in the segmental fragility with the MW.

This hypothesis was additionally confirmed by the anomalously large isotope\nshift of the water Tg [207]. The substitution of hydrogen by deuterium in H-bonding liq-\nuids usually leads to a very small shift in Tg, \u0394Tg < 1 K [207,211,212]. Recent dielectric\nstudies, however, revealed a shift in Tg between H2O and D2O \u0394Tg ~10\u201312 K (Figure 28)\nFigure 28. Temperature-dependent structural relaxation times \u03c4(T) in LDA water. \u03c4(T) increases about an order of magnitude when going from H2O (open symbols) to D2O (closed symbols). For liquids, this constitutes an unusually large isotope effect. The experimentally determined fragilities for LDA water are mH2O_LDA \u2248 mD2O_LDA = 14 \u00b1 1. The lines present the expected temperature dependence of \u03c4(T) estimated from Equation (51) using the total MSD of LDA water (solid lines) and the MSD with z ro-point vibrations excluded (dashed lines). The fragilities, estim d from the MSD data with zero-point vibrations taken into account, are: mH2O \u2248 14.5 and mD2O \u2248 19, simila to the experimentally determined values. When zero-point contributions to the MSD are excluded, the predicted fragility becomes mH2O \u2248 37 and mD2O \u2248 35. The calculations using LDA\u2019s total MSD reproduce the temperature dependence of \u03c4(T) well and thus emphasize the importance of quantum fluctuations in the dynamics of water at low temperatures.

As it was discussed in [207], this effect is consistent with the quantum effects and cannot be explained in the framework of classical relaxation. When increasing the temperature, the role of the quantum effects will fade. As a result, \u03c4\u03b1(T) will be controlled by the usual therm lly activated barrier crossing-type relaxation and return to a behavior typical for many liquids.

A large body of experimental studies revealed that the steepness of the temperature dependence of structural relaxation (fragility) varies from m~14 in water to m~200 in some polymers. Usually, covalentbonding liquids with strong directional bonds show a rather weak deviation of \u03c4\u03b1(T) from an Arrhenius temperature dependence (low fragility), while most of the VdW and ionic liquids with nondirectional interactions exhibit strongly non-Arrhenius behavior (high fragility). Hydrogen-bonding systems usually have intermediate fragility, although there are some exceptions. In this review, we specifically emphasized two important extreme cases of fragility. Polymers with extremely high fragility present a special case of glass-forming systems, which differs from small molecular liquids. This point was also emphasized in the review by Colmenero [200]. Chain connectivity, its intramolecular energy barriers and degrees of freedom, leads to a significant increase in polymer fragility, especially in rigid polymers. It is related mostly to an increase of the energetic part of the temperature dependence of structural relaxation (increase in EV/EP). A detailed microscopic picture of the polymerspecific contribution to fragility remains unresolved, although it is clearly stronger for more rigid chains, suggesting an important role of intramolecular energy barriers. The\nEntropy 2022, 24, 1101 37 of 44\nsecond extreme is presented by the unusually low fragility of water. It was ascribed to the quantum effect, and it would be important to verify this hypothesis in examples of other low-Tg liquids of light molecules. Entropic models have been rather successful in connecting the dynamics and thermodynamics, and there is indeed a good correlation between ln\u03c4\u03b1 and configurational entropy for many materials. However, the search for a diverging length scale and an increase in cooperativity of the structural relaxation (the core of the entropic models) so far did not find any clear confirmation. The experimental studies suggest rather weak changes in the characteristic length scale of structural relaxation. Even attempts to study glass transition in confinement did not bring any conclusive results (see, e.g., review [215]). Overall, the role of cooperativity and dynamic heterogeneity in glass transition remains unclear and is the focus of many current studies. Elastic models have been also successful in the description of \u03c4\u03b1(T) in many materials. The increase in the activation energy of the structural relaxation upon approaching Tg is indeed comparable to the temperature increase in the shear modulus. Elastic models also provide clear connections to the properties of fast dynamics, including MSD on the picosecond time scale. The latter can also be a measure of the free volume and, in this way, provides a connection to free volume ideas. In contrast to the entropic approach, elastic models do not predict a divergence of the time scale, which seems to be consistent with most of the experimental data. Although none of those three major approaches (entropy, elasticity, and free volume) provides complete and consistent descriptions for all the systems, each of them gives a good description for most of the experimental data. This suggests that there is an underlying physics that unites those three approaches, and this question has been discussed in several papers [83,167]. Some hybrid models, such as the one proposed by Mirigian and Schweizer [82\u201388], are trying to combine various approaches in one consistent picture and provide a unified description of the liquid dynamics in the entire temperature range from very high T down to Tg. In addition to cooperativity and dynamics heterogeneity, an even more general and important question is whether there is a divergence of the structural relaxation time scale at a finite T below Tg. This question is crucial, because the existence of this divergence would suggest true underlying phase transitions. Unfortunately, the current experimental data do not provide an unambiguous answer, and the theoretical models suggest both scenarios. Nevertheless, it seems that the current consensus is shifting more towards no divergence of \u03c4\u03b1(T) below Tg.\nAuthor Contributions: V.N.N. and A.P.S. equally contributed to this paper.
