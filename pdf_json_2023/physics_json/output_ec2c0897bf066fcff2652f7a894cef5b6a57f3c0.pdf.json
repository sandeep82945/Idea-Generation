    "abstractText": "Recent advancements in the study of the protein complex photosystem II have clarified the sequence of events leading to the formation of oxygen during the S3 \u2192 S4 \u2192 S0 transition, wherein the inorganic Mn4Ca(\u03bc-O)6(OHx)4 cluster finishes photo-catalyzing the water splitting reaction (Greife et al., Nature 2023, 617, 623\u2013628; Bhowmick et al., Nature 2023, 617, 629\u2013636). During this final step, a tyrosine radical (TyrZ), stable for a couple of milliseconds, oxidizes a cluster-bound oxygen while the hydrogen bonding patterns of nearby waters shift a proton away. A treatment of this redox reaction within the context of accepted transition state theories predicts rate constants that are significantly higher than experimentally recovered values (1012 s\u22121 versus 103 s\u22121). In an effort to understand this disparity, temperature-dependent experiments have revealed large entropic contributions to the rates with only a moderate enthalpy of activation. We suggest that the entropic source may be related to the observed proton rearrangements, and further possible near isoenergetic variations in the nearby extended H-bonding network delaying the realization of an \u2018ideal\u2019 transition state. In the following, we explore this relation in the context of Eyring\u2019s transition state theory and Marcus\u2019 electron transfer theory and evaluate their compatibility with the experimental evidence.",

Light drives water oxidation at the Mn4Ca-cluster indirectly [3,4], with a primary charge separation occurring at the electron donor side of PSII resulting in the formation of a delocalized chlorophyll cation radical (P680+). This is followed by the oxidation of a specific tyrosine residue, denoted as TyrZ or YZ. The subsequent electron transfer (ET) steps from the Mn4Ca cluster to TyrZox are closely related to the water oxidation chemistry coupled with proton movements over a large area on various length scales, as can be seen in Figure 1. Herein, we will discuss, in a broad sense, whether the Mn4Ca cluster\u2013TyrZox ET can be described favorably by transition state (TS) theory in the framework of the Eyring\u2013Polanyi equation [5\u20137], or whether elements of ET theories, e.g., the well-known semi-classical Marcus theory [8,9], are applicable or even essential for a correct description. We note that the following Results and Discussion section corresponds in parts to Sections SII.8 and SII.9 of the Supplementary Material of Greife et al. [10]. Our discussion specifically addresses the water oxidation reaction (or oxygen evolution reaction) in PSII, but it may, in parts, also be of relevance for the redox reactions of other proteins, molecules, and redox-active electrodes in electrocatalysis.\nInorganics 2023, 11, 389. https://doi.org/10.3390/inorganics11100389 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/inorganics\nInorganics 2023, 11, 389 2 of 10\nInorganics 2023, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 10\nIn Eyring\u2019s TS theory, the reaction rate (kTST) is governed by the Eyring\u2013Polanyi equation [5,6] involving the entropy (\u0394S\u2021) and enthalpy (\u0394H\u2021) of activation:\n\ud835\udc58 = \ud835\udc58 \ud835\udc47\n\u210e \ud835\udf05\ud835\udc52\n\u2021\n\ud835\udc52\n\u2021\n(1)\nwith kB, h, and T denoting the Bol mann constant, the Planck constant, and the absolute temperature in Kelvin.

[29], we estimate the tunneling distance as the molecular edgeto-edge distance between donor and acceptor moiety, where, herein, the acceptor moiety is the tyrosine radical and the donor is the Mn4Ca cluster. The \u2018edges\u2019 or rather the extension of the relevant orbital systems are not obvious and cannot reliably be identified without using computational approaches. We calculated several potentially relevant interatomic (internuclear) distances, as can be seen in Figure 3 and Table 1. An internuclear distance close to 5.7 \u00c5 is obtained between TyrZ-O and O6. This distance could be especially relevant because, in the rate-limiting ET step of the S3 \u2192 S0 transition, the formation of the O6\u2022 radical is facilitated by ET to the oxidized TyrZ, with a high spin density expected on the phenolic oxygen. This corresponds to a van der Waals tunneling distance of only about 2.5 \u00c5 (estimate obtained by subtracting a van der Waals radius of 1.6 \u00c5 [30] for each oxygen atom from the internuclear (TyrZ-)O\u2013O6 distance). Other potentially relevant internuclear distances in Table 1 are even shorter, predicting a particularly high tunneling probability. According to Moser et al., the tunneling distance of 2.5 \u00c5 corresponds to a free-energy optimized rate constant for electron tunneling on the order of 1012 s\u22121, or a time constant of 1 ps. The frequency that describes nuclear movements in the TS regime is about six times greater (kBT/h in Equation (1), about 6 \u00d7 1012 s\u22121 at 20 \u25e6C) suggesting that for oxygenevolution steps in PSII, a minor slow-down resulting from a limiting ET probability cannot be excluded. Staying in the framework of TS theory, such a slowdown could be described by a reduced transmission probability (reduced \u03ba-value), which would result in only a small reduction in the activation entropy that we calculated from experimental data using the Eyring\u2013Polanyi equation (Equation (1)).\nInorganics 2023, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 10\nsignificantly contribute to the experimentally determined entropy of activation is explored in the following.

The seven corresponding\ndistances and further distances are indicated in Table 1 with comparative distances for the structure\nPDB 6DHO (2nd flash, predominantly S3 state) [18].\nThe above considerations involve several approximations and estimates. Presumably, the tunneling probability exceeds the above estimate of 1012 s\u22121 because the \u2018medium\u2019 between the donor and acceptor moieties comprises atom groups (specifically W3 and W4) that could significantly lower the tunneling barrier. In addition, multiple parallel tunneling paths could also increase the overall tunneling probability. Thus, it is well conceivable that the adiabatic limit, where electron tunneling probabilities become irrelevant, is reached.\nInorganics 2023, 11, 389 5 of 10\nIn summary, uncertainties remain regarding the exact numerical value of the activation entropy, because of possible limitations due to electron tunneling. However, it is likely that the limiting case of adiabatic ET is almost, or even fully reached. If the adiabatic ET limit were not reached, the activation entropy would be moderately lower than the value formally determined by the application of Equation (1) to experimental data. However, this does not affect the central conclusion that there is a pronounced entropic slowdown of the oxygen-evolution transition. Based on minimum energy path (MEP) calculations, we proposed that the ET from the Mn4Ca cluster to TyrZox is coupled to the movement of four specific protons [10]. However, the used computational approach cannot clarify whether concerted ET and proton transfer (PT) is involved, that is, the simultaneous tunneling of the electron and one or more protons at the TS. This question is of relevance when assessing the significance of activation entropy formally calculated by the application of Equation (1) to experimental data, because, in the case of a truly concerted electron\u2013proton transfer (CEPT), the proton tunneling probability could influence the reaction rate and mimic an entropic slowdown. However, the low value of the experimentally observed H/D kinetic isotope effect (about 1.2 [31,32]) clearly disfavors a limitation of the reaction rate by the proton-tunneling probability. Further evidence supporting the entropic slowdown hypothesis comes from experimental indications for entropy\u2013enthalpy compensation in the total free energy of activation of the oxygen-evolution step. In PSII of higher plants (spinach) at room temperature, the rate constant is very similar to that of the thermophilic cyanobacterium (T. elongatus). However, the Arrhenius activation energy, and consequently, the activation enthalpy, are significantly lower for the higher-plant PSII [14]. For the cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, again another combination of action enthalpy and entropy has been reported [13]. We propose that the compensation of the decreased activation enthalpy by an increased activation entropy explains the identical rate constant values for differing organisms at similar temperatures in the physiological temperature range. This entropy\u2013enthalpy compensation in the activation energy of the oxygen-evolution step is still insufficiently understood and requires further investigation (work in progress). To this end, the experimental determination of the entropy and enthalpy of activation for various organisms as well as for PSII with genetically modified H-bond networks could address both (i) a possible physiological role in the genetic adaptation of various organisms to different environmental temperatures; and (ii) the elucidation of the molecular determinants (in terms of differing amino acid environments) of the experimentally observable shifts between the enthalpy and entropy\nInorganics 2023, 11, 389 6 of 10\nof activation, complemented by computational investigation. In general, entropy\u2013enthalpy compensation is well known, albeit somewhat controversial, for the free energy of activation relating to various catalytic processes in biological and non-biological systems [33\u201339]. Irrespectively of the explanation of entropy\u2013enthalpy compensation at the molecular level, finding entropy\u2013enthalpy compensation in PSII oxygen evolution supports the existence of a major entropic contribution to the total free energy of activation, and it disfavors alternative explanations like a dominating role of electron or proton tunneling probabilities."

            "text": "In PSII water oxidation, the environment of the two key protagonists, TyrZ and the Mn4Ca cluster, is characterized by an extended network of H-bonded water molecules and amino-acid residues. See Figure 4 for a two-dimensional mapping of the H-bond network (HBN) within 20 \u00c5 of the Mn4Ca cluster. There are over 40 resolved waters to be found, grouped into several different water channels. Some of these groups are likely involved in proton and water transport and have been shown to be variable during the S3 \u2192 S0 transition [10,11]. Similarly, it has been shown that a significant amount (>50,000) of quasi-isoenergetic protonation \u2018microstates\u2019 exist in bacterial photosynthetic reaction center photocycle intermediates [40]. We propose that multiple conformations, that is, multiple H-bond patterns with multiple orientations of water molecules and residues, can explain the experimentally found activation entropy in PSII. The weak interactions of this internal network could facilitate the observed compensation in a similar manner to what has been proposed in other systems with surface bound solvation water interactions [33,41\u201343]. The interplay between evolutionary optimized order (stabilization of favorable conformations) and thermally driven dynamics needs to be considered when discussing the functional relevance of the extended H-bonded protein\u2013water network. Following Greife et al. [10] (Supplementary Information, section SII.9), we point out that: (1) It is expected and has been verified by extensive molecular dynamics simulations on PSII that the protein internal H-bond networks (HBN) are highly dynamic, especially regarding water positions and H-bonding directionality, with a multitude of roughly isoenergetic conformations reached within nanoseconds at room temperature (see, e.g., ref. [44]). Even though these HBN dynamics may, in part, be conducive regarding PT reactions, they are largely \u2018inevitable\u2019 thermodynamic fluctuations. (2) The arrangement of the water molecules in the extended H-bonded protein\u2013water network surrounding the Mn4CaO5 cluster and the TyrZ is well resolved in the crystallographic structures determined at both cryogenic and room temperature. This implies that the HBN dynamics evolve around the mean positions of the individual nuclei that are detected by protein crystallography. The HBN and the related mean-value atom coordinates are likely evolutionarily optimized for efficient (fast) water oxidation. In light of (1) and (2), the qualitative explanation for the energy of activation in Greife et al. [10] appears plausible: \u2018Although well-defined coordinates of individual oxygen atoms are resolved in crystal structures, the presence of an HBN that is at the same time and in every detail perfectly arranged for the here discussed proton-coupled ET, will still be a rare event. The limited probability to reach this perfect conformation of all atoms of the HBN explains the entropic contributions to the activation energy.\u2019 We emphasize that, even if the optimal HBN conformation perfectly matches the atomic coordinates resolved by protein crystallography, it will still be rare that all atoms are simultaneously at their evolutionarily optimized positions at physiological temperatures.\nInorganics 2023, 11, 389 7 of 10\nInorganics 2023, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 7 of 10 (2) The arrangement of the water molecules in the extended H-bonded protein\u2013water network surrounding the Mn4CaO5 cluster and the TyrZ is well resolved in the crystallographic structures determined at both cryogenic and room temperature.

            "text": "Marcus and related theories on ET or CEPT reactions are powerful tools because they can predict rate constants based on a small number of clearly defined parameters, which are often experimentally accessible. The extended H-bonded protein\u2013water network in PSII might be seen as a special case of the solvent environment that in Marcus theory is described involving a quadratic energy dependence with the outer-sphere reorganization energy being the (only) decisive parameter [9]. However, such an approximative treatment does\nInorganics 2023, 11, 389 8 of 10\nnot consider individual solvent molecules. Instead, Marcus theory assumes a homogeneous solvent environment which responds to charges at the redox factors by a linear dielectric response; the total energy of charge solvation is decisive for the contribution of the outersphere reorganization to the activation energy. In contrast to the considerations on the ET in PSII of the Results and Discussion section, in Marcus theory, there is no special conformation of the solvent environment foreseen that uniquely supports the ET step; it is the total electrostatic solvation energy that matters, realized by a multitude of conformations of the solvent environment. Therefore, the underlying approximations of Marcus theory render its applicability to redox reactions in a protein environment with multiple conformations of a specific, evolutionary optimized protein\u2013water network problematic, inter alia because it cannot easily capture the entropic contributions to the free energy of activation discussed herein. Whether the predictive power of ET theory can be fruitfully used regarding the contribution of inner-sphere processes of contributing redox factors (in PSII and other redox proteins), remains to be answered. In conclusion, the common assumption (in ET theories) of nuclear movements in approximately quadratic potentials needs to be scrutinized for redox factors surrounded by a fluctuating protein-internal HBN. In summary, our considerations support the appropriateness of discussing the ratelimiting proton-coupled ET step in photosynthetic water oxidation in terms of Eyring\u2019s TS theory. We point out the important but apparently poorly understood role of activation entropy and hope that future work can shed more light on the interplay between order and statistical dynamics in PSII water oxidation, biological redox processes in general, homogeneous and heterogeneous catalysis.\nAuthor Contributions: The main text was written, edited, and reviewed by H.D. and P.G., with the initial conceptualization by H.D.
