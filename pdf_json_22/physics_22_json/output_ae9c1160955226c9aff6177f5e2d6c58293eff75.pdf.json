With the improvement of fabrication technology, several experimental methods, such as electron-beam-drilling,4 nanoscale lithography,5 and chemical synthesis,6 have been developed to precisely tailor the size and arrangement of nanopores on porous graphene, so that nanopores can be designed into an array with customizable geometries.7,8 Porous graphene with a prepared nanopore array has great potential in diverse applications, such as \ue103eld-effect transistors,7 electrochemical capacitors,9 thermal rectiers,10 and DNA sequencing technology.11\nCivil Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong\nics and Optical Communications, Beijing ions, Beijing, 100876, China.

See DOI:\nthe Royal Society of Chemistry\nAs one of the most attractive applications, porous graphene has been recently highlighted as a promising material for nextgeneration ltration systems for seawater desalination12,13 and gas separation.14,15 For ltration applications, a large pressure difference is usually applied between both sides of the membrane to drive the directional motion of molecules. Therefore, porous graphene is required to be strong and tough enough to survive the high-pressure environment. It is well known that the mechanical properties of graphene are degenerated by the introduction of nanopores,3,16,17 although defect-free graphene has ultrahigh elastic modulus and tensile strength.17 Understanding the relationship between the geometries of the nanopore array and the overall mechanical properties of porous graphene can provide signicant guidance to the design of porous graphene-based lter membranes with high performance and durability. Traditionally, the expressions of the structure\u2013property relationship can be tted from the experimental or computational results using some empirical methods and function forms. Although this estimation method using the tting law is easy to be used in practical applications, errors are unavoidably induced for some problems with high nonlinearity as it is difficult to predene an optimal function form for ttings. A state-of-the-art approach with high efficiency, reliability, and portability is thus required to nd the structure\u2013property relationship for this material.\nConsidering the diversity of the geometries of a nanopore array, it is very costly to experimentally characterizemechanical properties for all the possible congurations of porous graphene in the design space.

All-atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, which tracks interactions of each atom in a system over time, can calculate the detailed mechanical properties of graphene-based materials with validated accuracy. Several studies have explored the effects of pore size, pore density, and grain boundaries on the elastic properties and fracture behaviors of porous graphene using the MD simulation method.3,16\u201318 However, MD simulation as a computational method is normally resourceand time-consuming, which is hard to adapt to the demand of rapid iteration in the design ow. In addition to the forward prediction, another challenge is how to conduct an efficient reverse design, i.e. determine the geometries of the nanopore array for targeted mechanical properties. Recently, Chen et al. proposed a nano-topology optimizationmethod to design the nanostructures with atom-by-atom control.19 This method is still based on MD simulations and integrated with other relatively tedious processes, restricting its applications on the efficient reverse design of porous graphene. Theoretical models in fracture mechanics such as Grifth theory can describe the tensile strength of materials with a preexisting aw, e.g., a hole or a notch, as a function of structural factors, which can directly guide the reverse mechanical design.20 Unfortunately, it is usually difficult to analyze the effect of multiple pores arranged in an array by using these theoretical models. Moreover, previous studies found that the classic Griffith theory partially fails for a pore diameter smaller than 8 A\u030a.3,18\nIn recent years, the machine learning (ML) method has been applied to accelerate the design and discovery of materials.21\u201325 It is conrmed to be extremely efficient inmaterial design problems with high complexity compared with traditional experimental and computational methods. For example, Wan et al. applied ML to search for porous graphene with optimized thermal conductivity.26 Ye et al. utilized a deep neural network to predict the mechanical properties of composites with arbitrary component distributions.27 Xiong et al. extracted descriptions of the mechanical properties of steels based on ML.28 Various ML algorithms have been applied to automatically extract the structure\u2013 property relationship. However, to the best of our knowledge, the popular ML algorithms, such as support vector regression, decision tree, random forest regression, and convolutional neutral network, cannot provide explicit expressions for the structure\u2013 property relationship as a clear guidance. In this paper, the SISSO (Sure Independence Screening and Sparsifying Operator) algorithm proposed by Ouyang et al.29 is used for the prediction and design of mechanical properties of porous graphene with a periodic pore array. It is one of the ML algorithms with the same processes of data training and testing as other popular ML approaches. It can automatically derive the tting formulae without predened function forms for the structure\u2013property relationship, which can break through the restrictions above."

The geometry of such a nanopore array is determined by two independent structural variables, d and l. d is the pore diameter, and l is the ratio between d and lattice period a, as depicted in Fig. 1. We here choose l as one feature since it can be regarded as the measurement of porosity that is more frequently used in porous material systems. For pores arranged in a uniform square array, the porosity can be represented by l as pl2/4. Moreover, the ratio between the pore radius and strip width is adopted in the expression of the Griffith model developed for the fracture strength of a strip with a central hole.20 Using the geometry ratio l as a variable of the SISSO-derived formula can maintain the formal similarity to this classic model. Initially, atomic models of pristine monolayer graphene with a xed size of 20 nm 20 nm are constructed with periodic boundary conditions applied, which are as large as possible to satisfy the requirement of a representative volume element (RVE) for innite materials. Then pores with diameter d are introduced by calculating the coordinates of the pore centers and then removing the carbon atoms around the pore centers within circular domains of the diameter d. The connectivity of the remaining domains is guaranteed and no crack is allowed in the initial congurations. For the n n pore array, the lattice number n can be calculated by using L/a\u00bc Ll/d, where L is the length of the square simulation area. We make grids on the lattice number and porosity instead of d and l to generate a database for the convenience of atomic model construction due to the xed width of atomic models. Then corresponding values of d and l can be derived from the above relationships. The intervals of lattice number and porosity in the sampling grids are 1 and 0.05, respectively. The lattice number and porosity are distributed between [1, 10] and [0.05, 0.5], respectively. Thus, d varies from 0.5 nm to 16 nm and l varies from 0.25 to 0.8 in the database.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The interactions between carbon atoms are described by the adaptive intermolecular reactive empirical bond order (AIREBO) potential,31 which has been widely used and conrmed in graphene-based material systems.32\u201334 The original parameter of the carbon\u2013carbon cutoff distance in the potential is modied to be 2.0 A\u030a to avoid a known non-physical post-hardening phenomenon.35,36 The timestep is set at 0.5 fs during the overall simulation. The graphene sheet is initially aligned in an atomic plane. All the atomic models are rst optimized by using the conjugate gradient minimization algorithm, followed by the equilibrium process under an NPT ensemble at 300 K and 0 atm for 100 ps. The uniaxial elongation is performed along the armchair direction of graphene. During the uniaxial tension process, the simulation box deforms along the tensile direction with a given strain rate of 10 4 ps 1. Meanwhile, the simulation box shows uctuating sizes perpendicular to the tensile direction according to the barostat (0 atm), which releases stress to simulate the typical uniaxial tension process. All atomic coordinates are remapped with the deformation of the simulation cell as the periodic boundary condition. No restrictions are applied to themovement of atoms in any direction. The overall temperature of the simulation systems remains at 300 K during the uniaxial stretch. The atomic-level tensile stress is calculated via the virial theorem and averaged over the entire simulation cell. In the stress calculation, the thickness of graphene is assumed to be 3.4 A\u030a based on the literature.37\nStress\u2013strain (s\u20133) curves are obtained with increasing uniaxial tension until the porous graphene samples are destroyed and completely lose their load-bearing capacities, where s and 3 are the normal stress and engineering strain (i.e. the ratio of the elongation to the initial length) along the tensile direction. Strength and work of fracture are chosen as the targeted properties in this study. As shown in Fig. 1, the strength ss is taken from the peak value of the s\u20133 curve, and the work of fractureWc can be evaluated by using the area under the s\u20133 curve as Wc \u00bc \u00d0 3f 0 sd3. Here, 3f is the ultimate fracture strain where porous graphene is destroyed by tension. The higher strength and work of fracture indicate stronger and tougher porous graphene, which is desirable in many applications. Mechanical properties of pristine graphene without defects and holes are rst examined. The calculated strength and ultimate strain along the armchair direction are 94 GPa and 0.12, respectively, showing good agreement with reported MD results.38 Besides, the simulation results agree well with the reported experimental values of strength of 60\u201399 GPa39,40 and Young's modulus of 1 TPa,39 respectively. This indicates that our model settings and the potential le adopted in MD simulations are reliable for the following mechanical simulations of porous graphene."

Using these formulae obtained, prediction and inverse design tasks can be easily achieved. The formulae automatically derived by the SISSO model are highly portable, showing great convenience in practical engineering applications. Here we focus on the effect of the structural geometries of the square pore array on the mechanical properties of porous graphene, including the two independent features d and l. More variables can be generated by the combinations of d and l and added into the SISSO model. For conventional ML analysis, we should perform the feature (variable) selection before model training when too many variables exist to avoid overtting. In fact, here we manually screen the two independent variables from a geometrical view, which is equivalent to the feature selection process. Many previous studies have veried the applicability of SISSO algorithm for diverse problems with multiple variables.29,41 More variables that determine the mechanical properties, such as the size of graphene sheets42 and temperature,43 could be considered in future studies.\nThe SISSO algorithm combines sure independence screening (SIS) with the sparsifying operator (SO) to select a subspace of descriptors with the largest linear correlation with the targeted property. SIS constructs descriptors by iteratively applying a set of algebraic operators Q on the two primary features (termed J0), and then the SO evaluates all possible combinations of SIS-constructed descriptors and yields the optimal solution relying on the L0 regularization, which penalizes the number of nonzero coefficients. Multi-task SISSO algorithm can search for descriptors that predict multiple targets. Detailed parameter settings of these algorithms are discussed in the next section.\n3.2. k-fold cross-validation\nFor the general implementation of ML, a dataset should be split into two groups, a training set to t the model and a testing set to evaluate the model, which avoids overtting. However, the train-test-split method is not suitable for the small database in this study that only contains 95 samples. The material data that can be obtained in the actual problems are commonly limited (only a hundred or even dozens). Thus, it is a big issue to nd a fundamental interplay and establish a predictive model using a small database viaML approaches. The k-fold cross-validation test is thus adopted to avoid overtting for the following implementation of SISSO algorithm.\nNanoscale Adv., 2022, 4, 1455\u20131463 | 1457\nFig. 2 Schematic of the k-fold cross-validation test.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

A small dataset is randomly and evenly divided into k groups of samples, termed folds. (k 1) folds are selected as the training set to train a SISSO model, and the one fold remaining serves as the testing set to evaluate the trained model. This process will be repeated k times and each time a different fold is selected as the testing set. The cross-validation performance is measured by nally averaging the R2 for these k-times trained models. R2 is expressed as\nR2 \u00bc 1 Pn i\u00bc1 \u00f0yi y\u0302i\u00de2\nPn i\u00bc1 \u00f0yi y\u00de2\n(1)\nwhere yi and y\u0302i are the real value and predicted result of the sample i, respectively, and y is the average of all the real values. A higher R2 means better performance, and the R2 for a perfect model is equal to 1. By using this method, each data point in the small database can be fully utilized for model training andmore information can be gained from the limited data, which enhances the performance of the trained SISSO model in our study. Such processing has widely been conrmed to achieve effective and accurate MLmodels with a small database (dozens to hundreds of data points) in many previous studies.44,45 10- fold cross-validation suggested by the empirical evidence is utilized here. Since strength and work of fracture are considered in this work, the averaged R2 of two targets is used for comprehensive performance evaluation of SISSO model in the following discussion."

            "text": "As long as the tting formulae are derived, inverse structural design of the nanopore array could be convenient. Eqn (3) and (4) describe the mechanical properties as the functions of geometries of pore arrays, which can also help us to inversely nd the specied geometries for the given targeted properties. By using numerical methods, the solutions of l and d can be easily obtained from the function surfaces of ss and Wc plotted in Fig. 5. The ow chart of the inverse design is plotted in Fig. 6a. For example, take ss \u00bc 25 GPa or Wc \u00bc 1 GPa as the targeted mechanical properties. There exist multiple combinations of d and l in the function surfaces that can satisfy the design objectives. We choose three groups of geometrical parameters of the pore array for each target. Then corresponding atomic models are constructed and MD simulations are conducted to verify the accuracy of the design parameters obtained. Fig. 6b and c exhibit the detailed structural features designed for the targets and the MD-calculated results for validations. Obviously, all the porous graphene samples with pore arrays designed by the SISSO model achieve the targeted ss and Wc. Slight errors are\n1460 | Nanoscale Adv., 2022, 4, 1455\u20131463\nobserved, which can be accepted since a perfect design is almost impossible in practical situations. This indicates the success of inverse design using the tting formulae derived by the SISSO model. Compared with some ML approaches for inverse design, such as adaptive learning,21 convolutional neural network,25 and backpropagation,23 the tting formulae generated by the SISSO model possess tremendous advantages in portability and efficiency, without limitations of the working environment and computing resources.\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

            "text": "Furthermore, we chose several other typical forecasting methods available in the python library scikit-learn48 to compare with the SISSO algorithm used in this study to examine the predictive performance (see the ESI\u2020 for detailed settings and results of these methods used for comparison).\nLinear regression (LR),49 which is one of the most basic and well-understood methods to build a relationship between different quantities, is rst employed to t linear models based on the least squared approximation. Fig. S1a and b\u2020 plot the predicted results of LR models in all test sets against the MDcalculated values of strength and work of fracture, respectively. It is found that the linear models cannot predict targeted properties with d and l well. The averaged R2 is 0.7294, in which R2 \u00bc 0.8974 for strength and R2 \u00bc 0.5613 for work of fracture. The performance of LR is much worse than that of SISSO algorithm. In general, strong and tough porous graphene materials are needed for many applications, while the proposed linear models perform badly especially in predicting high strength and high work-of-fracture, as observed from the scattered data points in Fig. S1.\u2020 This also implies the nonlinear nature of the structure\u2013property relationship studied in this work.\nWe further introduced four popular ML algorithms, support vector regression with the linear function (SVR_lin) and radial basis function (SVR_rbf), decision tree (DT), as well as random forest regression (RF), to construct more powerful predictive models. Fig. 7 shows the summary of averaged R2 for all the ML algorithms given above and the SISSO model. The value of averaged R2 of SISSO algorithm (0.8966) exceeds those of SVR_lin (0.7162), DT (0.8385) and RF (0.8771), and it is slightly behind that of SVR_rbf (0.8980). The feature importance of two fed features can be given by the RF model. As shown in Fig. S4,\u2020 the importance of l is higher than d in RF. Applying the SISSO algorithm, we know from Fig. 5 that the mechanical properties\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nare more sensitive to l than d in general, since varying l brings larger uctuations in ss and Wc. Such contrast becomes more signicant when d is large. The different feature importance of l compared to d obtained from the SISSO model is similar to that obtained from RF. Besides, the tting formulae derived by the SISSO model can provide more detailed quantitative information about the relationship between features and targets that cannot be directly obtained by RF. The above comparisons indicate that the SISSO algorithm not only serves as a more convenient and portable tool for the inverse structure design of a pore array, but also predicts mechanical properties with comparable and even higher accuracy, when compared with other ML algorithms."

            "text": "In this study, we develop a SISSO-assisted approach for the mechanical design of porous graphene, where strength and work of fracture are set as the targeted properties. The optimal tting formulae are automatically derived from the SISSOmodel for the explicit description of the nonlinear structure\u2013property relationship. These expressions not only provide direct and accurate predictions of these targeted properties according to the geometrical arrangement of nanopore array but also serve as a useful guideline for the inverse design of porous structure. Compared with other forecasting methods including several popular ML algorithms, the SISSO algorithm is comparably accurate, portable, efficient and convenient. With reliable data gathered from experimental characterization studies and a larger amount of data samples, the performances like accuracy can be further improved. In addition, this proposed idea can be applied to design other physical properties related to the geometries of the nanopore array for porous two-dimensional materials.\nAuthor contributions\nAW \u2013 conceptualization, methodology, formal analysis, writing \u2013 original dra; HY \u2013 conceptualization, funding acquisition, writing \u2013 review and editing; ZG \u2013 formal analysis, writing \u2013 review and editing; JX \u2013 methodology, writing \u2013 original dra.\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conicts to declare."
