Comparative Efficacy of ICIs in Different Comorbidities: Conduct a larger, multicenter study comparing the efficacy and safety of ICIs in patients with advanced cSCC across various comorbid conditions, including autoimmune diseases, solid organ transplant recipients, and hematologic malignancies. This could help clarify the impact of comorbidities on ICI treatment outcomes and potentially identify subgroups that benefit most from ICI therapy.

Combination Therapies to Overcome ICI Resistance: Investigate the efficacy of combination therapies involving ICIs and other agents, such as anti-EGFR therapies, in overcoming resistance in advanced cSCC. This could include randomized controlled trials comparing ICI monotherapy to combination regimens to assess response rates, progression-free survival, overall survival, and safety profiles.

Neoadjuvant and Adjuvant ICI Therapy: Explore the role of ICIs in the neoadjuvant and adjuvant settings for high-risk cSCC patients undergoing surgery. Prospective trials could evaluate whether preoperative or postoperative ICI treatment improves surgical outcomes, reduces recurrence rates, and enhances overall survival compared to surgery alone.

Impact of ICIs on Quality of Life: Conduct studies assessing the impact of ICI treatment on the quality of life (QoL) and functional status of patients with advanced cSCC. This research could include longitudinal studies measuring QoL indicators before, during, and after ICI therapy to understand how these treatments affect patient well-being beyond traditional clinical endpoints.

Mechanisms of ICI Action and Resistance in cSCC: Perform in-depth molecular and immunological studies to unravel the mechanisms underlying the action of ICIs in cSCC and the development of resistance. This could involve genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic analyses of tumor samples before and after ICI treatment to identify biomarkers of response and resistance, potentially leading to targeted therapies to enhance ICI effectiveness.
