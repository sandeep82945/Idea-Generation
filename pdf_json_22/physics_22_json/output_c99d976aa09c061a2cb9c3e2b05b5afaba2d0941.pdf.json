    "abstractText": "Within the framework of the local hidden gauge approach, we have studied the near-threshold D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 interaction with quantum numbers I (J PC ) = 0(0++), 0(2++), 1(0++), and 1(2++), respectively. The contact term and vector meson exchange term in coupled channels are taken into account in this work. One pole, which is found in the case of the quantum numbers I (J PC ) = 0(0++), could be associated to the X (4014) recently observed by the Belle Collaboration. Thus, we suggest that the X (4014) may be an D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 molecular state with I (J PC ) = 0(0++), and more precise information about X (4014), such as resonance parameters and decay properties, could be useful to shed light on its structure.",

            "text": "In last two decades, a large amount of the charmoniumlike states, named XY Z states, have been observed experimentally [1\u20135]. Many kinds of theoretical interpretations to their structures have been proposed, such as hadro-quarkonia [6,7], tetraquarks [8,9], hadronic molecules [10\u201315], kinematic effects [16\u201319], and the mixing of different components. Since most of the XY Z states appear at certain hadronic thresholds, hadronic molecule is one of the most promising interpretations among the various exotic states, although there are still many controversies. For instance, the hidden-charm state X (3872) is quite close to the DD\u0304\u2217 threshold [20,21], Zcs(3985) is close to the D\u0304s D\u2217/D\u0304\u2217s D threshold [22]. Recently, a T+cc state reported by the LHCb Collaboration has the mass very close to the D\u2217+D0 threshold [23,24], and could be interpreted as a D\u2217D molecular state [25\u201330]. The Zc(4025) observed by the BESIII Collaboration [31,32] could be interpreted as the D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 molecule with\na e-mail: chendy@seu.edu.cn (corresponding author) b e-mail: wangen@zzu.edu.cn\nI (J P ) = 1(1+) [33]. In addition, a loosely DD\u0304 bound state with I (J PC ) = 0(0++) was predicted in Ref. [34], and the authors of Refs. [35,36] claimed that there were some experimental evidences of such a bound state in the processes \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2192 DD\u0304 and e+e\u2212 \u2192 J/\u03c8DD\u0304 [37\u201339]. As pointed out in Ref. [40], the molecular structure should appear at any threshold of a pair of heavy-quark and heavy-antiquark hadrons with attractive interaction at threshold, and experimental information about such structures is crucial to deepen our understanding of the interactions between heavy hadrons and the internal structures of the exotic states.\nIn the year of 2021, the Belle Collaboration has analyzed the two-photon process \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c8(2S) from the threshold to 4.2 GeV for the first time [41], and found two structures in the lineshape of the cross sections. The first one with a local significance of 3.1\u03c3 corresponds to one resonance with a mass and width to be,\nM1 = 3922.4 \u00b1 6.5 \u00b1 2.0 MeV, 1 = 22 \u00b1 17 \u00b1 4 MeV, (1)\nwhich may be the X (3915), \u03c7c2(3930), or the mixing of them, and the second one with a local significance of 2.8\u03c3 corresponds to a new resonance X (4014) with a mass and width to be,\nM2 = 4014.3 \u00b1 4.0 \u00b1 1.5 MeV, 2 = 4 \u00b1 11 \u00b1 6 MeV. (2)\nAs discussed in Ref. [41], the X (4014) state has a mass in agreement with the predicted mass 4012 MeV for the J PC = 2++ D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 molecule with the assumption of X (3915) as a J PC = 0++ D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 molecule [42,43]. However, the binding energy of D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 is of the order of 100 MeV if one considers the X (3915) as a D\u2217 D\u0304 molecular state, which is much larger than the ones of X (3872), Zcs(3985), T+cc , and Zc(4025). It should also be pointed out that the molecular explanation of X (3915) is still in debate. For instance, in Refs. [44\u2013\n48] the X (3915) and \u03c7c2(3930) could be assigned as the \u03c7c0(2P) and \u03c7c2(2P) charmonia, respectively, and in Ref. [49] X (3915) is suggested as an S-wave D+s D\u2212s molecular state. Thus, it implies that the nature of the newly reported X (4014) state is still unclear, and the study on the D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 interaction is crucial to explore its possible internal structure.\nThere are many investigations of the D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 interaction in literatures [33,50\u201352]. In our previous work, we have analysed the BESIII measurement of e+e\u2212 \u2192 (D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217)\u00b1,0\u03c0\u2213,0 reactions by taking into account the vector-vector D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217, K \u2217 K\u0304 \u2217, and\u03c1\u03c1 interactions within the framework of local hidden gauge formalism, and concluded that the Zc(4025) structure could be a shallow D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 bound state [33]. Recently, the interactions between charmed hadrons have been described by constant contact terms, and 229 molecular states were predicted [50]. In Ref. [50], the masses of the D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 bound states with I (J PC ) = 0(0++)/0(1+\u2212)/0(2++) are 1.82 \u223c 36.6 MeV lower than the D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 threshold, which favors the D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 molecular explanation for the X (4014) state. In the present work, we will investigate the S -wave near-threshold D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 interaction within an alternative framework, i.e. the local hidden gauge approach, and the vector exchanges in the crossed channels in the hidden gauge model provide further insights into the contact interactions explored in Ref. [50]. We also discuss the possibility of the X(4014) as the D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 molecular state and its favored quantum numbers.\nThis paper is organized as follows. We will show the formalism adopted in the present estimations in Sect. 2, and present the calculated results and related discussions in Sect. 3. Finally, Sect. 4 will be devoted to a short summary."

The Lagrangian is taken from the local hidden gauge formalism describing the interaction of vector mesons, which is [53,54],\nL = \u22121 4 \u3008V\u03bc\u03bdV\u03bc\u03bd\u3009, (3)\nwhere the symbol \u3008 \u3009 stands for the trace of SU(4) vector meson matrix, and the tensor V\u03bc\u03bd is defined as,\nV\u03bc\u03bd = \u2202\u03bcV\u03bd \u2212 \u2202\u03bdV\u03bc \u2212 ig [ V\u03bc, V\u03bd ] , (4)\nwith V\u03bc to be,\nV\u03bc =\n\u239b\n\u239c \u239c\u239c\u239c \u239d\n\u03c9\u221a 2 + \u03c10\u221a 2\n\u03c1+ K \u2217+ D\u0304\u22170\n\u03c1\u2212 \u03c9\u221a 2 \u2212 \u03c10\u221a 2 K \u22170 D\u2217\u2212\nK \u2217\u2212 K\u0304 \u22170 \u03c6 D\u2217\u2212s D\u22170 D\u2217+ D\u2217+s J/\u03c8\n\u239e\n\u239f \u239f\u239f\u239f \u23a0\n\u03bc\n. (5)\nBy expanding the effective Lagrangian in Eq. (3), one can obtain two types of D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 interactions, which are vectormeson exchange interactions (Fig. 1a\u2013c) and contact interaction (Fig. 1d), respectively.\nThe SU(4) structure of the Lagrangian allows one to take into account all the possible channels with certain quantum numbers. In the present work, the relevant channels are those with zero charmness and strangeness. In the case of I = 0, we considered the 10 channels, which are D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217, D\u2217s D\u0304\u2217s , K \u2217 K\u0304 \u2217, \u03c1\u03c1, \u03c9\u03c9, \u03c6\u03c6, J/\u03c8 J/\u03c8 , \u03c9J/\u03c8 , \u03c6 J/\u03c8 , \u03c9\u03c6 respectively. And we take 6 channels into account for the case of I = 1, which are D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217, K \u2217 K\u0304 \u2217, \u03c1\u03c1, \u03c1\u03c9, \u03c1 J/\u03c8 , \u03c1\u03c6 respectively.\nBy Expanding the Lagrangian in Eq. (3), one can get the effective Lagrangian of three and four vector mesons interactions. As for the three vector mesons interaction, it reads,\nL(3V )I I I = ig \u2329 V \u03bd\u2202\u03bcV\u03bdV \u03bc \u2212 \u2202\u03bdV\u03bcV\u03bcV \u03bd \u232a\n= ig \u2329(V\u03bc\u2202\u03bdV\u03bc \u2212 \u2202\u03bdV\u03bcV\u03bc ) V \u03bd \u232a . (6)\nWith the above effective Lagrangian, one can construct the vector-meson exchange term. The t-channel exchange amplitude corresponding to Fig. 1a is,\nA(t) = 1 m2ex g2 1 \u00b7 \u22173 2 \u00b7 \u22174 \u00d7 ( m2ex (s \u2212 u) + (m21 \u2212 m23)(m22 \u2212 m24) )\n\u2212 4g2 1 \u00b7 \u22173 (p1 \u00b7 2 p2 \u00b7 \u22174 + p1 \u00b7 \u22174 p4 \u00b7 2) + 4g2 p1 \u00b7 \u22173 ( 1 \u00b7 2 p2 \u00b7 \u22174 + 1 \u00b7 \u22174 p4 \u00b7 2) \u2212 4g2 2 \u00b7 \u22174 (p1 \u00b7 \u22173 p2 \u00b7 1 + p2 \u00b7 \u22173 p3 \u00b7 1) + 4g2 p3 \u00b7 1 ( 2 \u00b7 \u22173 p2 \u00b7 \u22174 + \u22173 \u00b7 \u22174 p4 \u00b7 2),\n(7)\nwheremex stands for the mass of the exchange vector meson, the Mandelstam variables are defined as s = (p1 + p2)2, t = (p1 \u2212 p3)2 and u = (p1 \u2212 p4)2, which satisfy the constraint s + t + u = \u2211i m2i . Here indices 1, 2, 3, and 4 correspond to the particles with the momenta p1, p2, p3, and p4 in Fig. 1 and the dot indicates the scalar products involving polarization vectors.\nAs for the u-channel (Fig. 1b), the exchange amplitude A(u) can be obtained from the expression of A(t) by exchanging p3 \u2194 p4 and \u22173 \u2194 \u22174 . The s-channel exchange (Fig. 1c) amplitude A(s) can also be obtained from the expression of A(t) by performing the exchange p2 \u2194 \u2212p3 and 2 \u2194 \u22173 .\nAs for the four vector mesons interactions, it corresponds to the contact term, which reads,\nL(c) = g 2\n2\n\u2329 V\u03bcV\u03bdV \u03bcV \u03bd \u2212 V\u03bdV\u03bcV\u03bcV \u03bd \u232a . (8)\nWith the above effective Lagrangian, one can obtain the amplitude corresponding to Fig. 1d, which is,\nA(c)D\u2217+D\u2217\u2212\u2192D\u2217+D\u2217\u2212 = 2g2 ( 1 \u00b7 2 \u22173 \u00b7 \u22174 + 1 \u00b7 \u22173 2 \u00b7 \u22174\n\u22122 1 \u00b7 \u22174 2 \u00b7 \u22173 ) ,\nA(c) D\u2217+D\u2217\u2212\u2192D\u22170 D\u0304\u22170 = g2 ( 1 \u00b7 2 \u22173 \u00b7 \u22174 + 1 \u00b7 \u22173 2 \u00b7 \u22174\n\u22122 1 \u00b7 \u22174 2 \u00b7 \u22173 ) , (9)\nwhere the superscript \u2018c\u2019 stands for the contact term.

[55], the gauge coupling constant g can related to the masses of the vector mesons and the decay constants of the corresponding pseudoscalar meson, i.e., g = mV / fP , for example, considering SU(3) symmetry, one has g = m\u03c1/ f\u03c0 . However, considering the large violation of SU(4) symmetry, one can adopt different coupling constants for different channels [56], in particular, we take gD = MD\u2217/(2 fD) = 6.9 for D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 channel, gDs = MD\u2217s /(2 fDs ) = 5.47 for the D\u2217s D\u0304\u2217s channel, g\u03b7c = MJ/\u03c8/(2 f\u03b7c ) = 5.2 for the J/\u03c8 J/\u03c8 channel and still using g = M\u03c1/(2 f\u03c0 ) = 4.17 for the channels that involve light mesons with f\u03c0 = 93 MeV, fD = 206/ \u221a 2 = 145.66 MeV [57], fDs = 273/ \u221a 2 =\n193.04 MeV [57] and f\u03b7c = 420/ \u221a\n2 = 296.98 MeV [58]. By considering the spin projection operators and the\nisospin doublets of the charmed and anticharmed mesons as in Refs. [51,59], we obtain the kernels of D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 interactions. As for the vector meson exchange processes, one can obtain the total amplitudes with well-defined isospin, where all the possible exchanged mesons have been included. Using the amplitudes for the spin projections we can split the terms into their spin parts, and taking D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 \u2192 D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 as an example, we obtain,\nV (ex,I=0,J=0,2) D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217\u2192D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217\n= g 2 D(2 M 2 \u03c9M 2 \u03c1 + M2J/\u03c8(3 M2\u03c9 + M2\u03c1))(4 M2D\u2217 \u2212 3 s)\n4 M2J/\u03c8M 2 \u03c9M 2 \u03c1\nV (ex,I=1,J=0,2) D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217\u2192D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217\n= g 2 D(2 M 2 \u03c9M 2 \u03c1 + M2J/\u03c8(\u2212M2\u03c9 + M2\u03c1))(4 M2D\u2217 \u2212 3 s)\n4 M2J/\u03c8M 2 \u03c9M 2 \u03c1\n(10)\nwith the superscript \u2018ex\u2019 stand for the vector-meson exchange term. As for the contact interactions for different isospin and total angular momentum, the potentials corresponding to D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 \u2192 D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 read,\nV (c,I=0,J=0) D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217\u2192D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 = 6g2D, V (c,I=0,J=2) D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217\u2192D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 = \u22123g2D, V (c,I=1,J=0) D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217\u2192D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 = 2g2D, V (c,I=1,J=2) D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217\u2192D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 = \u2212g2D. (11)\nThe potentials of other channels resulted from vector meson exchange and contact interaction can be found in Refs. [51, 60] for details.\nMoreover, it should be clarified that the mass of X (4014) is very close to the threshold of D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217, and we mainly discuss the energy range around the threshold, thus, s = (p1 + p2)2 4m2D\u2217 , with this approximation, we collected all the relevant potentials in Table 1, which are the sum of the vector meson exchange and contact terms.\nWith the above potentials, one can search the possible poles by solving the Bethe\u2013Salpeter equation, which is,"

            "text": "Before we discuss the numerical results, the values of the relevant parameters should be clarified, which include the parameter \u03bc, and the subtraction constant \u03b1 introduced by the two-meson loop function. From Eq. (14), one can find,\nG \u223c 1 16\u03c02\n[\n\u03b1 + log m 2 1\n\u03bc2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n]\n= 1 16\u03c02\n[ \u03b1 \u2212 log \u03bc\u03032 + log m\u030321 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ] , (17)\nwhere \u03bc\u0303 and m\u03031 are the values of \u03bc andm1. Then, in this case, one can define a new model parameter\u03b1\u2032 = \u03b1\u2212log \u03bc2, which is the only model parameter. When we set \u03bc = 1 GeV for all the channels as indicated in Ref. [51], we have \u03b1\u2032 = \u03b1. Then only the \u03b1 dependences of the results should be carefully checked. As indicate in Ref. [62], the subtraction constant \u03b1\nin the loop function should depend on the mass of involved mesons by, \u03b1 \u223c \u22122 log \u239b \u239d1 + \u221a 1 + m 2\n\u03bc2\n\u239e\n\u23a0 . (18)\nIn practical estimations, one usually consider \u03b1 as a parameter around the value determined by Eq. (18). For example, the parameter \u03b1 in the loop function with light mesons, also named \u03b1L , is determined to be \u2212 1.65 [60], which is close to the one obtained by Eq. (18). As for the parameter \u03b1 in the loop function with heavy-light meson, which is also name as \u03b1H , it should be in principle smaller than \u03b1L . For example, in Ref. [51] the value of \u03b1H is fixed to be -2.07 in order to get a pole around 3940 MeV in I = 0, J = 0 case, which is associated to the X (3915).\nAs for the discussed X (4014), one can find the experimental data of the cross sections for \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c8(2S) are very inaccurate around 4014 MeV [41], thus, it is a bit difficult to fit our results directly with experimental data on this occasion. So in the present work, we mainly focus on the resonance parameters of the X (4014), and vary the subtraction constant \u03b1H in a large range, i.e., \u22122.0 < \u03b1H < \u22121.4, to check whether one can simultaneously reproduce the mass and width of X (4014) in a reasonable parameter range.\nWith the above formalisms, we can estimate the amplitudes for the D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 \u2192 D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 transition with quantum numbers I (J PC ) = 0(0++), 0(2++), 1(0++), and 1(2++), respectively. Here, we take the case of I (J PC ) = 0(0++) as an example to show the modulus squared of the amplitude |TD\u2217 D\u0304\u2217\u2192D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 | depending on the subtraction constant \u03b1H in Fig. 2. From the figure, one can find when \u03b1H is very small, such as \u03b1H = \u22122.0, there is a pole around 3964 MeV, by increasing \u03b1H , the pole moves to the threshold, then the modulus squared of the amplitude behaves like a cusp when\n\u03b1H is greater than \u2212 1.65, which will not correspond to any bound state any more.\nIn Fig. 3, we present the \u03b1H dependences of the estimated masses and widths of poles for the cases of I (J PC ) = 0(0++), 0(2++) and 1(2++), respectively. From the figure, one can find that the pole masses increase with the increasing of \u03b1H , and there are overlaps between the theoretical estimations and Belle data. As for the pole widths, they decrease with the increasing of \u03b1H and there are also overlaps between the present estimations and the experimental data. In Table 2, we collect the \u03b1H ranges determined by reproducing the measured mass and width of X (4014). One can find that the resonance parameters of X (4014) can be reproduced by adjusting the subtraction parameter \u03b1H in three possible I (J PC ) cases. In particular, we can simultaneously reproduce the mass and width of X (4014) with \u22121.75 < \u03b1H < \u22121.65 for I (J PC ) = 0(0++) case, while the \u03b1H are determined to be \u22121.63 \u223c \u22121.40 and \u22121.47 \u223c \u22121.40 for I (J PC ) = 0(2++) and 1(2++) cases, respectively. However, as we have clarified that the value of \u03b1H should be smaller than \u03b1L , which is \u22121.65. From our estimations, one can find only the I (J PC ) = 0(0++) assignment could fulfill this criteria. Considering the large uncertainties of the experimental data and the lower limit of \u03b1H for I (J PC ) = 0(2++) is -1.63, which is very close to \u03b1L , we conclude that the I (J PC ) = 0(2++) assignment should be\n0(0++) \u22121.75 \u223c \u22121.65 \u22121.79 \u223c \u22121.65 \u22121.75 \u223c \u22121.65 0(2++) \u22121.63 \u223c \u22121.40 \u22121.64 \u223c \u22121.40 \u22121.63 \u223c \u22121.40 1(2++) \u22121.63 \u223c \u22121.40 \u22121.47 \u223c \u22121.40 \u22121.47 \u223c \u22121.40\nweakly favored, while the \u03b1H range for I (J PC ) = 1(2++) assignment is much larger than \u03b1L and thus such assignment should be excluded.\nFrom the above analysis, we conclude that X (4014) can be D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 molecular state with I (J PC ) = 0(0++) and the resonance parameters can be reproduced with \u22121.75 < \u03b1H < \u22121.65. In this parameter range, we also find two bound states with I (J PC ) quantum numbers to be 0(2++) and 1(2++), respectively, as shown in Table 3. By comparing the resonance parameters of I (J PC ) = 0(0++) state, one can find the masses of 0(2++) and 1(2++) states are about 10 MeV below the one of 0(0++) state. But the widths of 0(2++) and 1(2++) states are larger than the one of 0(0++) state. In particular, the widths of 0(2++) and 1(2++) states are estimated to be (13 \u223c 21) MeV and (39 \u223c 59) MeV, respec-\ntively. In Ref. [63], the authors argued that the mass of the D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 molecular state with I (J PC ) = 0(2++) was about 4013 MeV, and the upper limit of the width was estimated to be about 10 MeV, which is similar to our present estimations. However, the estimations in Ref. [64] indicated that the D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 molecular state with I (J PC ) = 0(2++) was a deeply bound state with the binding energy to be several tens MeV, and the widths was estimated to be 50 \u00b1 10 MeV, which was much different with Ref. [63] and the present estimations.\nBesides the above three bound state, we further checked the \u03b1H dependences of modulus square of the amplitude for the case of I (J PC ) = 1(0++) in Fig. 4. From the figure one can find that in a very large \u03b1H range, i.e., \u22122.0 < \u03b1H < \u22121.0, there is no pole in the modulus square of the amplitudes, which indicates that the D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 can not form a bound state with I (J PC ) = 1(0++) based on present calculations."

            "text": "Inspired by recent observation of X (4014) in the process \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2192 \u03b3\u03c8(2S), we have studied the hidden-charm D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 interaction within the framework of the local hidden gauge approach, where the possible I (J PC ) quantum numbers could be 0(0++), 0(2++), 1(0++), and 1(2++) respectively. For the case of I (J PC ) = 0(0++), our estimations indicate that in the \u03b1H range of \u22121.75 \u223c \u22121.65 one can reproduce\nthe resonance parameters of X (4014), which satisfy the constraint of \u03b1H < \u03b1L . As for the cases of I (J PC ) = 0(2++) and I (J PC ) = 1(2++), one can also reproduce the measured mass and width of X (4014) with a larger \u03b1H . As for the case of I (J PC ) = 1(0++), our calculations indicate that there is no pole in the modulus square of the amplitudes in the considered parameter range.\nTo summarize, in the D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 molecular scenario, our estimations favor the I (J PC ) = 0(0++) assignment for X (4014) comparing to I (J PC ) = 0(2++), and the I (J PC ) = 1(2++) assignment could be excluded. However, it should be clarified that the local significance of X (4014) is only 2.8\u03c3 , more experimental information about this state is crucial to shed light on its nature. Besides the I (J PC ) = 0(0++) state, we also predict two states with I (J PC ) = 0(2++) and I (J PC ) = 1(2++) with the masses to be about 10 MeV below the one of X (4014).\nBefore the end of this work, we should mention that there are some hints of X (4014) in the existing experimental data. For instance, the Belle Collaboration has measured the inclusive process e+e\u2212 \u2192 J/\u03c8X , and one can observe a peak around 4014 MeV in the Mrec(J/\u03c8) distribution, as shown in Fig. 1 of Ref. [65]. Later, the Belle Collaboration reported the study of the processes e+e\u2212 \u2192 J/\u03c8D(\u2217) D\u0304(\u2217), and there is more events in the energy region 4000 < MDD\u0304\u2217 < 4025 MeV of the DD\u0304\n\u2217 invariant mass distribution, as depicted in Fig. 2b of Ref. [66]. In addition, in the cross sections of the process \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c9 measured by the Belle Collaboration, one can find the events concentrate in the region 4010 \u223c 4020 MeV [67]. All the above hints imply that one state with a mass close to the D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 threshold and a narrow width may exist, which coincides with the X (4014) observed by the Belle Collaboration [41].\nNote added During the review of this work, we prepared another work to estimated hidden charm decay processes of X (4014) in a D\u2217 D\u0304\u2217 molecular scenario with J PC = 0++ [68], and we found the width of X (4014) \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c9 is sizable and suggested to search X (4014) in the \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2192 J/\u03c8\u03c9 process, which should be accessible in Belle II.\nAcknowledgements The authors thank Prof. Zhi-Hui Guo for valuable discussion and suggestive comments.
