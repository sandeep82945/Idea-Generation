    "abstractText": "The construction of hybrid junctions remains challenging for the rational design of visible light-driven photocatalysts. Herein, In2S3/CdS/N-rGO hybrid nanosheets were successfully prepared via a one-step pyrolysis method using deep eutectic solvents as precursors. Benefiting from the surfactant-free pyrolysis method, the obtained ultrathin hybrid nanosheets assemble into stable three-dimensional self-standing superstructures. The tremella-like structure of hybrid In2S3/N-rGO exhibits excellent photocatalytic hydrogen production performance. The hydrogen evolution rate is 10.9 mmol\u00b7g\u22121\u00b7h\u22121, which is greatly superior to CdS/N-rGO (3.7 mmol\u00b7g\u22121\u00b7h\u22121) and In2S3/N-rGO (2.6 mmol\u00b7g\u22121\u00b7h\u22121). This work provides more opportunities for the rational design and fabrication of hybrid ultrathin nanosheets for broad catalytic applications in sustainable energy and the environment.",

            "text": "The photocatalytic decomposition of water to produce hydrogen has been identified as an effective and most promising strategy for dealing with environmental crises and energy scarcity [1]. Given the efficient use of solar energy, there have been many attempts in recent years to develop different photocatalysts for the decomposition of water under visible light [2]. Among which, chalcogenides and chalcogenide-based semiconductor materials have been widely investigated as photocatalysts for water splitting due to its inexpensive synthesis, low toxicity, large absorption coefficient, and narrow band gap energies [3]. The facile synthesis enables the rational design of chalcogenide catalysts with various shapes and structures and enriches the construction of hierarchical composites with other components to gain more interesting properties [4\u201310]. Cadmium sulfide (CdS) is widely used among many semiconducting metal sulfide materials due to its narrow band gap (2.4 eV), powerful reducibility, wide range of optical absorption wavelengths and a suitable energy band structure, which can effectively absorb visible light [7]. Nevertheless, CdS suffers from problems of stability in photocatalytic processes due to photocorrosion. There are still several issues with CdS that limit the rate of hydrogen production from pure CdS particles [11]. Up to now, numerous steps have been taken to address these problems [9,10,12], of which building heterojunctions with other semiconductors has been proven to be one of most the effective strategies [13\u201315]. For example, CdS/g-C3N4 nanoheterojunctions have been prepared using a hydrothermal method to improve its visible light photocatalytic performance for H2 production [14]. Huang et al. reported the synthesis of CdS/ZnS nanocomposites for extraordinary photocatalytic H2 generation via a type-II heterojunction [15]. Indium sulfide (In2S3) is an n-type semiconductor with a band gap of 2.0 to 2.4 eV, which has good stability as well as high photosensitivity [16]. Thanks to these advantages of both CdS and In2S3 semiconductors, more and more reports have focused on the synthesis of In2S3/CdS nanocomposites to form\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7878. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28237878 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 7878 2 of 13\neffective photocatalysts [17\u201321]. The suitable energy band structure between In2S3 and CdS benefits the construction of the In2S3/CdS heterojunction, which would accelerate the separation of photogenerated carriers and result in enhanced photocatalytic performance as compared to individual ones. For example, In2S3 nanoparticles have been deposited on CdS nanorod arrays for enhanced solar light-driven photoelectrochemical hydrogen evolution [22]. Yang et al. reported a Cu-doped In2S3/CdS heterojunction with a high spatial charge separation rate to boost photocatalytic hydrogen production [23]. However, sulfides have their inherent disadvantage of photocorrosion [24]. Thermodynamically, photocorrosion happens because of high oxidative h+ in the valence band which tends to oxidize lattice S2\u2212 ions of CdS and In2S3 during the photocatalytic process. But the stability incensement could be achieved by adding a suitable sacrificial agent to scavenge the holes with competitive kinetics. For example, the photocatalytic activity and stability of sulfide photocatalysts can be efficiently improved by adding an S2\u2212/SO32\u2212 mixture as an electron donor for hydrogen evolution from water. On the other hand, graphene oxide has recently been introduced into semiconductor photocatalysts to further improve the efficiency of charge transfer and thereby improve photocatalytic activity and stability [25]. For example, Jia et al. reported the preparation of a N-doped graphene/CdS nanocomposite for water splitting under visible-light illumination, in which N-doped graphene could act as a protective layer to prevent photocorrosion of the CdS photocatalyst [26]. Liu et al. prepared a stacked nanostructure of GO\u2013CdS@MoS2 to diminish the shortage of serious photocorrosion and obtain a high photocatalytic H2 evolution performance [27]. These sulfide/graphene composite preparation methods usually involve the pre-preparation of graphene and the release of poisonous substances. Thus, developing an environmentally friendly route is urgently needed to prepare sulfide/graphene composites. Recently, deep eutectic solvents (DESs) have been accepted as novel media to apply to the fields of chemistry, materials, and catalysis because of the unique physicochemical properties including being environmentally friendly, its strong solvating ability, and its tunable compositions. More and more works have been reported exploring the potential of using DESs as reaction media for material synthesis, such as nanometals, zeolite-type materials, carbon materials, and metal\u2013organic frameworks [28,29]. In this work, In and Cd-containing DES liquids were elaborately designed and applied to the synthesis of a hybrid In2S3/CdS/N-rGO photocatalyst via one-step pyrolysis, which is schematically shown in Figure 1. The unique liquid property of the DES precursor results in the in situ formation of tightly coupled interfaces in the hybrid. The in situ formed heterojunction with a spherical tremella-like structure could contribute to more active sites, highly efficient transfer and separation of photogenerated carriers, and the acquisition of strong redox stability. Under visible light, the hydrogen production rate of the In2S3/CdS/N-rGO photocatalyst achieved 10.9 mmol\u00b7g\u22121\u00b7h\u22121, which was 2.9 times that of a single component CdS and 4.2 times that of an In2S3 photocatalyst.

Formation of DES\nThe formation of deep eutectic solvents (DESs) of CdCl2\u00b72.5H2O, InCl3, and ethylene glycol was first characterized. As shown in Figure 1, we collected FT-IR of CdCl2\u00b72.5H2O, InCl3, ethylene glycol, and DESs. After DES formation, the chemical shift of -OH decreased because of hydrogen bond formation between Cl\u2212 ions and the hydrogen atom in the DESs [30]. The absorption peak at 3429 cm\u22121 corresponds to the stretching of -OH in ethylene glycol. After DES formation with CdCl2\u00b72.5H2O and InCl3, the -OH was chelated by Cl\u2212. As a result, the -OH band moved to a lower wavenumber and significantly widened, which is evidence of hydrogen bond formation, enabling the components to be tightly coupled at the molecular level. At the same time, the oil bath temperature for the reaction to form a transparent and uniform liquid is about 75 \u00b0C. The melting point of the mixture was lower than the melting point of each component, which can also reveal the formation of DESs (the melting point of InCl3 is 586 \u00b0C, and CdCl2\u00b72.5H2O is 568 \u2103) [31]. The obtained DES liquids were used as precursors to synthesize the In2S3/CdS/N-rGO photocatalyst via a one-pot pyrolysis, as schematically shown in Figure 2.\nFigure 2.

The corresponding STEM-EDS elemental mappings in Figure 4h reveal a uniform distribution of Cd, In, S, C, O, and N elements in the In2S3/CdS/N-rGO hybrid. It can be concluded that the In2S3/CdS photocatalyst coated with a graphene oxide shell can be successfully prepared by the DES precursor-assisted one-pot pyrolysis method. The N-doped graphene oxide shell can inhibit the photocorrosion of metal sulfide to a certain extent and accelerate the electron transfer of charge at the interface, which would greatly improve the photocatalytic activity and stability. Figure 5 shows XPS spectra of In 3d, Cd 3d, S 2p, C 1s, O 1s, and N 1s for different photocatalysts, respectively. The 443.4 eV and 451.0 eV peaks in Figure 5a match the In 3d5/2 and In 3d3/2 binding energy, indicating the presence of an In3+ state in the hybrid [34]. The characteristic peaks at 404.4 and 411.2 eV in Figure 5b correspond to the Cd 3d5/2 and Cd 3d3/2 binding energy of a Cd2+ valence state [35]. As shown in Figure 5c, the S 2p spectrum can be fitted into two peaks at 160.4 eV and 161.6 eV, attributed to the characteristic peaks of S 2p3/2 and S 2p1/2 of S2\u2212 [36]. The C 1s spectrum of In2S3/CdS/N-rGO is shown in Figure 5d. The characteristic peak at 284.5 eV corresponds to sp2 hybridization carbon and carbon atoms single- or double-bonded to the nitrogen atoms or oxygen [37]. The peaks at 285.6 and 288.7 eV correspond to the C\u2013C/C=C and O\u2013C=N/C-N functional groups [38]. The O 1s peak can be deconvoluted into four peaks at 530.9 eV, 532.1 eV, 533 eV, and 533.4 eV (Figure 5e), which come from surface-absorbed OH groups on In2S3/CdS as well as C=O, (CO*)OH, and C\u2013O\u2013C groups remained in rGO [39].

As a result, the accumulation of holes on the VB of CdS was prevented, inhibiting the photocorrosion of CdS and improving the stability of the photocatalyst. The elaborately designed DES liquid procedure enables the formation of the In2S3/CdS/N-rGO hybrid in one step, resulting in tightly coupled interfaces and an enhanced charge conductivity. In addition, the coupling of N-rGO plays significant roles in improving the photocatalytic performance. N-doping introduces electron-rich N into the graphene framework and enhances the electrical conductivity of rGO. N-doping forms additional defects and leads to a structural change in graphene carbon, which serve as active sites for the in situ growth of In2S3 and CdS, forming tightly coupled interfaces and enhancing the charge transfer of the hybrids [54]. Also, N-rGO can protect In2S3 and CdS from corrosion. Furthermore, the tremella-like structure provides more active sites for reactant species, such as hole scavengers, H+, and H2O, promoting reaction kinetics for enhanced photocatalytic activity [55]. In summary, the CdS/In2S3/N-rGO hybrid possesses a synergetic effect of visible light absorption enhancement, type-II heterojunction formation, and spherical tremella-like structure, which act together to achieve high photocatalytic performance."
