    "abstractText": "Multiple micro-magnetic non-destructive testing (NDT) technologies are suitable candidates for predicting the mechanical properties of cold-rolled steel strips. In this work, based on magnetic domain dynamics behavior and magnetization theory, the correlation between electromagnetic characteristics extracted by multiple micro-magnetic NDT technologies and the influence factors was investigated. It was found that temperature and tension can subsequently affect the electromagnetic parameters by altering the domain structure and domain walls\u2019 motion properties. Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients were employed to reflect the dependence of micromagnetic characteristics on influencing factors. The lift-off was determined as the largest influence factor among influence factors. A pseudo-static detection was reached by polynomial fitting, which could eliminate the influence of lift-off on the detection results. The number of training models was optimized, and the detection accuracy was improved via the improved Generalized Regression Neural Network (GRNN) model, based on the Gaussian Mixture Clustering (GMC) algorithm.",

            "text": "Currently, the mechanical properties of cold-rolled steel strips (yield strength (Rp0.2), tensile strength (Rm), yield elongation (A), etc.) are commonly obtained by destructive experiments. However, destructive experiments are generally time-consuming, laborintensive, wasteful in cutting, and lacking in data. Furthermore, the manufacture of ferromagnetic materials is growing automated, and its quality evaluation should not be limited to the laboratory but should also be parallel or embedded in the production process [1]. Yet, on the production line, in order to form feedback with the rolling process and provide a comprehensive warranty for customers, it is necessary to obtain steel strip mechanical properties of \u201cmeter-level\u201d and \u201cfull-length\u201d. These goals can be achieved by the appropriate micro-magnetic NDT methods. Micro-magnetic NDT technologies, used to characterize the micro-structure [2\u20136] and stress state of ferromagnetic materials [7\u201312], are based on different magnetization principles [1\u20133,13\u201315]. They were first proposed in 1955 and have attracted wide attention since [1]. Desvaux et al. [16] and O\u2019Sullivan et al. [17] studied the influence of residual stress, the micro-structure, elasticity, and plastic deformation of ferromagnetic materials on the BN method. The results show that the BN can be used to characterize the grain size of ferromagnetic materials and is in good agreement with those measured by X-ray diffraction. Wang et al. studied the coupling relationship between BN signal and stress and developed the BN stress testing instrument [18\u201320]. Boller et al. [21] indicated that the peak value of IP is sensitive to the influence of stress. Grimberg et al. [22] designed\nMaterials 2022, 15, 2151. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma15062151 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2022, 15, 2151 2 of 21\na system for non-destructive testing using IP and found that the coercivity measured by the IP method increases with the increase in fatigue times. Ryu et al. [23] studied the application of the reversible permeability method to evaluate material life under the long-term influence of a high-temperature environment for 1Cr-1Mo-0.25 V material in the steam turbine, and they found that the reversible permeability peak\u2013peak distance decreases with the extension of material life. Wang et al. studied the relationship between incremental permeability, eddy current impedance, and micro-structure, and they found a new incremental permeability characteristic value to represent the average grain size and lattice friction of the material. The yield strength of the steel was estimated by using the new characteristics, and approximate accurate results were obtained [24]. Under field conditions, influence factors, for instance, temperature, working stress, residual stress, elastoplastic deformation of the material itself [25,26], and even material micro-structure [2\u20136,14,15], are usually accompanied. Moreover, influence factors not only reduce the detection accuracy but are also difficult to separate from the detection target. Fortunately, with the development of intelligent algorithms, a major breakthrough has been made for the integrated application of multi-micro-magnetic NDT technology and parameter separation [27\u201329]. XiuCheng et al. integrated Barkhausen and tangential magnetic field methods to predict the surface hardness of a 12CrMoV Steel Plate. The average error of the BP prediction model was reduced from 3.7% to 3.5% after adding the characteristic values of the tangential magnetic field [30]. The Fraunhofer Institute in Germany proposed the micro-magnetic, multi-parameter, micro-structure and stress analysis (3MA) technology. As well as this, the Fraunhofer Institute, using a multiple regression model, established a testing system to test mechanical properties based on 3MA technology [1,31\u201333]. However, the influences of the testing environment have not been discussed, and the influence degree has not been explored. Furthermore, to eliminate the negative effects, influence factors are commonly regarded as input models, the same as electromagnetic characteristics [1]. In the meantime, the detection model corresponds to a specific application object and does not have direct portability. Therefore, a large number of models will be generated, which will affect the training efficiency. In this research, influence factor (temperature, tension, lift-off) experiments are carried out, and Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficients between influence factors and magnetic characteristics are calculated, intuitively demonstrating that lift-off has the greatest influence on detection accuracy. After regression of lift-off, a pseudo-static detection is reached, which could eliminate the influence of lift-off on the detection results. Multiple micro-magnetic technologies combined with an improved GRNN model, based on the GMC algorithm, are used to predict the mechanical properties of cold-rolled steel strips online and reduce the number of offline training models. The confidence interval of predictions can reach over 95% at the absolute error level of 10%."

Firstly, when the cold-rolled steel strips are running, rollers are used to minimize vibration and keep lift-off stable. Secondly, a probe is placed in a suitable position through a PLC control and position device, which can also send the signal of the lift-off between the probe and cold-rolled steel strips to a local database (LD). Thirdly, cold-rolled steel strips can be locally magnetized by the probe, which is a methodical combination of multiple micro-magnetic NDT techniques (TMF, BN, IP, EC) [1], as shown in Figure 2.

            "text": "Figure 3 illustrates the trend of electromagnetic characteristics with temperature. As the temperature increases, the BN characteristics (MMAX, MMEAN, MR) monotonically decrease, while the corresponding IP characteristics are irregular. The EC characteristics almost all show a monotonic change with temperature. The different responses to the temperature of the detection methods imply different physical principles. The temperature rise will change the magnetostatic energy of the material and rearrange the magnetic domains, which could increase the number of magnetic domains. Meanwhile, the temperature rise will reduce the pinning effect threshold [34\u201336], thus reducing the energy consumption of the domain walls (DWs) breaking through the pinning. The main source of BN energy is the irreversible movement of domain walls (magnetic domain jump), which is closely related to the pinning effect threshold and the amount of pinning point. Therefore, on the premise that the material state does not change (assuming that the number of pinning points is unchanged), with the increase in temperature and\nMaterials 2022, 15, 2151 5 of 21\nunder the same magnetization state, the energy consumption of the DWs\u2019 breakthrough pinning effect decreases, which weakens the BN signal [37]. In addition, increasing temperature alters the energy distribution of the material, which makes the domains more chaotic [7]. The energy required to align the domain along the direction of the external magnetic field through the external magnetic field increases. Therefore, the irreversible magnetic moment deflection under the same external magnetic field, the higher the temperature, the more difficult it is to deflect, which also leads to the weaker BN signal. In other words, rising temperatures weaken the BN signal in at least two ways. The IP characteristic signal corresponds to reversible magnetic domain movement, while the BN characteristic signal corresponds to irreversible magnetic domain movement. At low magnetic fields, reversible domain motion is caused by the expansion of domain walls, like elastic films, and by the shift of magnetic moments from the crystallography easy magnetization axis direction to the magnetization direction. With the cancellation of the external magnetic field, the domain structure will return to its original state. Compared with irreversible domain motion, reversible domain motion is more random under the action of temperature. The reasons for this phenomenon are explained as follows. The energy required to generate reversible domain motion is small, and to capture irreversible domain motion, IP requires an additional high-frequency excitation at the magnitude of mA [1,14,15]. Magnetostatics energy increases with increasing temperature [34\u201336]. In order to reduce the magnetostatic energy, the number of magnetic domains increases, which makes the domain sequence chaotic and the magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy increase [2,3]. In addition, with increasing temperature, IP characteristics present phase change, suggesting that the change of domain energy caused by temperatures is random. At low magnetic fields, magnetic energy is not guaranteed to overcome the temperature-induced energy change and make the magnetic moment rotate along the direction of magnetization. Therefore, the IP characteristics become unordered compared to the BN method. Under the premise of fixed experimental conditions, the impedance of the eddy current coil is mainly affected by the electrical conductivity, effective permeability, and external excitation frequency. The increase in temperature will change the conductivity and effective permeability of ferromagnetic materials. In ferromagnetic materials, the higher the temperature is, the higher the hindrance effect of crystal defects on phonons is; this means that the free path of phonons decreases, which can decrease the thermal conductivity.\nMeanwhile, according to Wiedemann\u2013Franz law, which is defined as,\n\u03ba\n\u03c3T = L0 (1)\nwhere \u03ba is thermal conductivity, T is absolute temperature, \u03c3 is electrical conductivity, and L0 is proportionality constant. The thermal conductivity of the material is proportional to the electrical conductivity. The increase in temperature reduces the thermal conductivity, as well as the electrical conductivity. According to the above analysis of IP, the material permeability is changed with the temperature increase. Under the same temperature, the effective permeability can be changed by different external magnetic fields [15].

Therefore, the nonlinear variation of multifrequency eddy current characteristics is mainly caused by permeability. Tension is regarded as the external stress of the cold-rolled steel strips. When the strip is subjected to external stress, the internal stress of the strip will also change, which affects the magnetic domain movement during the magnetization process [7\u201312].

            "text": "The IP characteristic signal corresponds to reversible magnetic domain movement,\nwhile the BN characteristic signal corresponds to irreversible magnetic domain move-\nment. At low magnetic fields, reversible domain motion is caused by the expansion of\ndomain walls, like elastic films, and by the shift of magnetic moments from the crystal-\nlography easy magnetization axis direction to the magnetization direction. With the can-\ncellation of the external magnetic field, the domain structure will return to its original\nstate. Compared with irreversible domain motion, reversible domain motion is more ran-\ndom under the action of temperature. The reasons for this phenomenon are explained as\nfollows. The energy required to generate reversible domain motion is small, and to cap-\nture irreversible domain motion, IP requires an additional high-frequency excitation at\nthe magnitude of mA [1,14,15]. Magnetostatics energy increases with increasing temper-\nature [34\u201336]. In order to reduce the magnetostatic energy, the number of magnetic do-\nmains increases, which makes the domain sequence chaotic and the magnetocrystalline\nFigure 3.

In addition, with increasing temperature, IP characteristics present phase change, suggesting that the change of domain energy caused by temperatures is random. At low magnetic fields, magnetic energy is not guaranteed to overcome the temperature-induced energy change and make the magnetic moment rotate along the direction of magnetization. Therefore, the IP characteristics become unordered compared to the BN method. Under the premise of fixed experimental conditions, the impedance of the eddy current coil is mainly affected by the electrical conductivity, effective permeability, and external excitation frequency. The increase in temperature will change the conductivity and effective permeability of ferromagnetic materials. In ferromagnetic materials, the higher the temperature is, the higher the hindrance effect of crystal defects on phonons is; this means that the free path of phonons decreases, which can decrease the thermal conductivity.\nMeanwhile, according to Wiedemann\u2013Franz law, which is defined as, \ud835\udf05\ud835\udf05 \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e = \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f0 (1)\nwhere \ud835\udf05\ud835\udf05 is thermal conductivity, \ud835\udc47\ud835\udc47 is absolute temperature, \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udf0e is electrical conductivity, and \ud835\udc3f\ud835\udc3f0 is proportionality constant. The thermal conductivity of the material is proportional to the electrical conductivity. The increase in temperature reduces the thermal conductivity, as well as the electrical conductivity. According to the above analysis of IP, the material permeability is changed with the temperature increase. Under the same temperature, the effective permeability can be changed by different external magnetic fields [15]. The conductivity showed a monotonically decreasing trend with the increasing temperature. Temperature and excitation frequency increased, while the permeability changed in stages. Therefore, the nonlinear variation of multifrequency eddy current characteristics is mainly caused by permeability. Tension is regarded as the external stress of the cold-rolled steel strips. When the strip is subjected to external stress, the internal stress of the strip will also change, which affects the magnetic domain movement during the magnetization process [7\u201312].

Wh r as MMAX and EAN are less volatile, the monotonic increase in HCM and the decrease in HD50M and HD75M reduce the area of the butt rfly curve. It is believed that the BN energy is decreasing with the increase in exter al stress.

This indicates that when the magnetic field direction is perpendicular to the external stress direction, the effect of intra-lattice stress on the BN is superior to that of the applied stress. The IP characteristics (UMAX, UMEAN) change dramatically when the internal stress of the lattice is dominant but gently when the external stress is dominant. IP characteristics, such as DH50U and DH75U, have the opposite rule. UR and HCU vary almost linearly. In\nMaterials 2022, 15, 2151 10 of 21\nother words, when the internal stress of the lattice is dominant, external stress is applied to change the internal stress state of the material lattice and the magnetic axis. Therefore, under the action of the same magnetic field perpendicular to external stress, reversible expansion of magnetic domain and reversible deflection of the magnetic moment are more impeded, which will weaken the IP signal. The IP signal of the stress weakening in the crystal is reflected in the decrease in UMAX and UMEAN of the IP butterfly curve. When the external stress exceeds 35 MPa, the ferrite deforms elastically, and the magnetic domain changes to the external stress direction. At this point, a magnetic field perpendicular to the direction of the magnetic domain is applied, and the magnetic field overcomes the external stress to increase the energy consumption of the magnetic domain to the direction of the magnetic field (reversible motion). Therefore, under the same weak magnetic field, the larger the external stress is, the weaker the reversible magnetic domain is. The IP signal weakened by external stress is reflected in the decrease in the width of the butterfly curve (DH50U and DH75U). Similar to the BN method, the EC also shows a phased change in the range of 5\u201335 MPa. This is because the external stress interacts with the internal stress of the lattice, causing electrical conductivity and effective permeability to respond differently to the result of their action. However, when it exceeds 35 MPa, the principal stress direction is external stress direction, and with the increase in pearlite elastic deformation, dislocation density increases, which increases the obstruction to phonons, so the thermal conductivity and electrical conductivity decrease. At the same time, the effective permeability is also decreasing. So, almost all EC characteristics show monotonicity variation within 35\u201375 MPa. The cold-rolled steel strip is not completely smooth during the movement due to mechanical vibration; the distance between the bottom surface of the strip and the probe is variable. While the cold-rolled steel strip is magnetized, the skin effect exists, which is defined as,\nJ = JSexp(\u2212 x \u03b4 ) (2)\nwhere Js is the current density on the surface of the cold-rolled steel strip, x is the distance between the current and the surface of the cold-rolled steel strip (lift-off), and \u03b4 is a coefficient related to the resistivity of the cold-rolled steel strip and the frequency of the alternating current, which is defined as,\n\u03b4 = \u221a 2\u03c1 \u03c9\u00b5\n(3)\nwhere \u03c1 is the resistivity of the cold-rolled steel strip, \u03c9 is the angular frequency of the alternating current, and \u00b5 is the absolute permeability of the cold-rolled steel strip. When the lift-off is changed, the magnetization state of the cold-rolled steel strip is changed due to the skin effect. We can conclude that the detection results are a function of temperature, tension, and lift-off coupling effects in a constant magnetic field. The function between influence factors and electromagnetic properties is hard to explain by explicit relationships."

The GMC based on EM mathematical algorithm is defined as { \ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc66|\ud835\udf03) = \u2211 \ud835\udefc\ud835\udc58\u2205(\ud835\udc66|\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc58) \ud835\udc3e \ud835\udc58=1 \u2205(\ud835\udc66|\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc58) = 1 \u221a2\ud835\udf0b\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc58 \u2212 \ud835\udc52\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc5d [\u2212 (\ud835\udc66\u2212\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc58) 2 2\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc58 2 ]\n\ud835\udc3f(\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc58) = \u220f \ud835\udc5d(\ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56; \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc58) \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc56 , \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc58 \u2208 \ud835\udf03, \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 \u2208 \ud835\udc45 \ud835\udc5a, \ud835\udc56 = 1,2,\u22ef\ud835\udc5b\n(4)\nwhere, \ud835\udefc\ud835\udc58 is coefficient, \ud835\udefc\ud835\udc58 \u2265 0 , \u2211 \ud835\udefc\ud835\udc58 = 1 \ud835\udc3e \ud835\udc58=1 , \u2205(\ud835\udc66|\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc58) is Gaussian distribution density, \ud835\udf03\ud835\udc58 = (\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc58, \ud835\udf0e 2), \ud835\udc3f(\ud835\udf03\ud835\udc58) is likelihood function, \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc56 is the \ud835\udc56 sample, \ud835\udc45 \ud835\udc5a is a sample set, and m is the dimension.\nAs shown in Figure 10, a new method, an improved GRNN model based on the GMC\nalgorithm, is proposed to predict mechanical properties. Mechanical properties (Rm,\nRp0.2, A), obtained from the LD, are selected as input parameters of the GMC model.\nThe value of RMSE is sensitive to individual extra-large or extra-small errors in a set of measurements. The estimated value obtained by the estimation method can minimize the root mean square error and, normally, does not generate individual large error values. Therefore, RMSE can better measure the measurement precision. RMSE can be expressed as\nRMSE =\n\u221a \u2211Ni=1(y \u223c i \u2212 yi)\nN (8)"

Initially, the cold-rolled strip number 27,383, a total of 200 pieces, was marked. After cluster analysis, target data were divided into 3 clusters, a total of 1665 strips, which were composed of 13 kinds of cold-rolled steel strips. Cold-rolled strips with more than 150 pieces were removed, and 7 kinds of cold-rolled steel strips, a total of 1281 pieces, were retained after reprocessing. The results obtained by GMM is shown in Figure 11. The model evaluation function is used to evaluate the results, which are shown in Table 3 andTable 4. At the absolute error level of 10%, after lift-off regression, the confidence interval of yield strength prediction is improved from 71% to 95% and the confidence interval of the tensile strength prediction increased from 94% to 100%.
