"The proposed model is a very simple model that contains two compartments, and many other classes have been ignored. Here, we have established the qualitative analysis of the existence theory of solution and numerical interpretation. However, from present results, we concluded that the piecewise derivative can help to understand the effect of the short memory effect in the dynamical systems, which cannot be explained through an ordinary fractional-order derivative."
