"To validate the model, we perform computational simulations and study the basic reproduction number and compartments. We present the behavior of the compartments for a scenario and study the impact of the variation of parameters associated with overweight by social pressure and diabetes due to causes other than obesity."

"In our work, we limit ourselves to the study of the negative impact of overweight and obesity on people of normal weight and define the transmission rate. We must take into account that the opposite effect (i.e., those of normal weight may contribute to help the obese and overweight) may also have an influence but this is not the current focus of our work. To obtain some parameters such as those related to transitions, development of diabetes and the influence of social factors on overweight require population-based studies. These results provide information for the construction of a control strategy with the aim of reducing obesity and overweight and diabetes."
