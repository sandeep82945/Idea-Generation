These advances and innovations are aimed at realizing higher-speed communication in various applications. More specifically, the three contributions selected demonstrate advances in passive optical networks (PONs), hybrid visible light communication (VLC) and radio frequency (RF) systems, and optical data center networks (DCNs) enabled by synergistic switch control. The first article, \u201c50G-PON: The First ITU-T Higher Speed PON System\u201d by Ren\u00e9 Bonk et al., discusses 50 G-PON which has recently been standardized by the International Telecommunication Union \u2014 Telecommunication Standardization Sector (ITU-T). The 50G-PON standard represents a significant leap in line rate from the 10 Gb/s systems deployed in current fiber access systems. Such a big jump is enabled by fundamental advances in the optical transceiver components in conjunction with digital signal processing algorithms and enhanced error correction codes. Key innovations are also set forth in optical network unit (ONU) activation procedures, contention-based operation, and expanded cryptographic features. With these improvements, 50G-PON systems are expected to meet the new and demanding requirements of emerging services. The second article, \u201cAccess Frameworks and Application Scenarios for Hybrid VLC and RF Systems: State of the Art, Challenges, and Trends\u201d by Fubin Wang et al., reviews the state of the art in VLC and RF systems. The authors envision VLC as a promising candidate for wireless communication in the future while describing the limitations of the technology such as its limited coverage and inconvenient uplinks. The article points out that hybrid VLC and RF systems can overcome the weakness of VLC alone, leveraging the full potential of high data rates provided by VLC and the wide coverage of RF systems. The technical characteristics and specific advantages of hybrid VLC and RF systems are discussed in different application scenarios promoting high data rate, high energy efficiency, and high reliability. Future trends of hybrid VLC and RF systems are also discussed. Finally the third article of the series, \u201cSynergistic Switch Control Enabled Optical Data Center Network\u201d by X. Xue and N. Calabretta, proposes a solution for optical switching in DCNs. Although optical switching with high bandwidth and low latency promises to revolutionize DCNs, the lack of optical buffers and adaptable and fast optical switch control schemes impede their practical deployment. To solve these problems, the authors propose and experimentally demonstrate an optical switch and control system based on a combination of label control, a synchronization mechanism, and a clock distribution mechanism, all of which synergistically operate at a nanosecond timescale and exploiting a novel Optical Flow Control (OFC) protocol to solve the packet contention issue without optical buffers. This is our first issue serving as the Series Editors of the Optical Communications and Networks Series.

We would like to thank all the authors for submitting their important research results to this Series, the reviewers for their voluntary work and willingness to give back and serve the scientific community by providing high-quality reviews, feedback, and comments to the authors that allow maintaining the high standards of this magazine, and to the publication staff and the Editor-in-Chief of IEEE Communications Magazine for their support.",
