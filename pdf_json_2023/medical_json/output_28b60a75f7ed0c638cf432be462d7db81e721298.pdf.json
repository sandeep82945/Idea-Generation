    "abstractText": "Direct contact between the conidia of entomopathogenic fungi (EPF) and their host is a prerequisite to successful infection; the host can, therefore, be infected by both direct treatment and by transmission of fungal inoculum from infested surfaces. This unique characteristic makes EPF especially relevant for the control of cryptic insects. In the case of the red palm weevil (RPW) Rhynchophorus ferrugineus, the eggs and larvae are almost inaccessible to direct-contact treatment. The objective of the present study was to investigate the mechanism of conidia transmission from a treated surface to host eggs and larvae. Foam pieces infested with Metarhizium brunneum conidial powder, conidial suspension, or distilled water were used as a laying surface for RPW females. The number of eggs laid was not affected by the EPF treatments and ranged from 2 to 14 eggs per female. However, hatching rate and larval survival were significantly reduced in the conidial powder treatment, resulted in 1.5% hatching and no live larvae. In the conidial suspension treatment, 21% of laid eggs hatched, compared to 72% in the control treatment. In both M. brunneum treatments, females\u2019 proboscis, front legs and ovipositor were covered with conidia. The females transferred conidia in both treatments to the laying holes, reaching up to 15 mm in depth. This resulted in reduced egg-hatching rate and significant larval mortality due to fungal infection. The stronger effect on egg and larval survival using dry conidia seemed to result from better conidial adhesion to the female weevil in this formulation. In future studies, this dissemination mechanism will be examined as a prevention strategy in date plantations.",

The weevils develop\nJ. Fungi 2023, 9, 458. https://doi.org/10.3390/jof9040458 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jof\nJ. Fungi 2023, 9, 458 2 of 14\nwithin the tree trunk, destroying its vascular system and eventually causing the collapse and death of the tree. The weevil originated in South-East Asia and is now widely distributed in Asia, Oceania, Africa, Europe and the Middle East and Israel [2]. Females oviposit in the splitting bark, at the base of young leaves, or in wounds on the leaves and trunks. In these oviposition sites, eggs are laid close to the surface in a hole the female drills in the plant tissue. The hatched larvae tunnel into and feed on the surrounding tissue, thereby destroying it [3]. Control of the RPW is thus essential, but encounters difficulties in two aspects: first, resistance towards chemical pesticides, and second, their delivery towards the eggs and larvae. Attempts to develop an integrated pest management, based on combination with nematodes, are promising, as their motility enables them to reach the concealed stages of the RPW [4]. In entomopathogenic fungi (EPF), direct contact between conidia and host is a prerequisite to successful infection via adhesion of conidia to the cuticle and subsequently penetration of it [5,6]. The host can be infected both by direct treatment and by transmission of fungal inoculum from treated surface, e.g., soil, bark, plant, or from infected insects or cadavers to untreated insects or to subsequent developmental stages via the generation of new conidia [7\u20139]. In the case of R. ferrugineus, most of the life cycle passes within the tree trunk, making the pest inaccessible to direct-contact treatment. Due to that, one can hypothesize that adults are the only stage that can be efficiently exposed to conidia and be infected upon emergence from the plant or upon contact with other individuals. Previously, we have found that up to 42% of adult weevils trapped from various locations in Israel were infected with Hypocrealean EPF, Beauveria or Metarhizium spp. [10]. That observation supports the existence of some rout of infection. In another previous study, the authors demonstrated that an Israeli M. brunneum (previously designated as M. anisopliae 7) isolate caused 80% mortality in larvae of the RPW. Further, they speculated that females can vector conidia to their progeny via contaminating the eggs during oviposition [11]. However, results could not support that speculation due to low mortality rates of eggs, probably due to insufficient inoculum transfer. In the present study, we hypothesized that the application of EPF conidia to surfaces on which RPW females oviposit would result in the acquisition of conidia to the body surface of the females, and transmission and dissemination of conidia into the region in which eggs are being laid. Consequently, this transmission would result in direct contact between conidia and eggs. To evaluate this, we developed an experimental setup system based on the highly efficient M. brunneum isolate applied as dry or wet conidia. This system enabled us to evaluate whether the female can effectively acquire conidia, either in dry or wet formulation, and convey it onwards to its progeny and, if so, how the dissemination occurs. The specific objectives of this study were: (1) to develop a procedure to examine the transfer of wet and dry conidia from a treated surface to R. ferrugineus eggs and larvae; (2) To monitor the distribution of conidia on a treated surface following oviposition behavior of R. ferrugineus females; (3) To examine the effect of conidiatreated surface on R. ferrugineus females\u2019 survival, eggs per female, egg hatch rate and larvae survival."

Discussion Capturing the essential behavioral processes that occur between arthropod host and pathogen is essential to exploiting entomopathogens for microbial pest control [17]. As a general rule, transmission is described as the number of new infections per unit of time, a factor that depends on parasite transmission efficiency and the density of both parasites and hosts [18]. The dispersal of pathogen propagules\u2014EPF conidia\u2014from infected to new hosts is a prerequisite for disease initiation and pathogenic interactions [19]. Horizontal transmission usually refers to the transmission of pathogen propagules \u2018within generations\u2019 (also termed autodissemination) or between individuals of the same host species, whereas vertical transmission occurs \u2018between generations\u2019 [17]. The transmission mechanism of EPF conidia from the female to its progeny has never been studied; we, therefore, aimed to elucidate its mechanism and impact in RPW. We describe the acquisition and dissemination of M. brunneum conidia (\u2018the parasite\u2019) from a conidium-treated surface to the female RPW (\u2018the transmitter\u2019) and from there, via the female\u2019s laying activity, to the egg laying hole and to the eggs and larvae (\u2018the hosts\u2019). Dissemination and transmission of EPF conidia is affected by numerous insect behaviors, among them movement, grooming, foraging, avoidance, mating and oviposition. Possible transmission due to oviposition behavior has been documented in only one study on long-horned beetles [20], where transmission of Metarhizium anisopliae propagules during oviposition of Anoplophora glabripennis was discussed. In nature, arthropods may accumulate or acquire the conidia themselves from naturally occurring EPF, whereas in an agricultural scenario, this acquisition may be due to exposure to EPF-covered surfaces\nFigure 8.

Fungi 2023, 9, 458 11 of 14\ning oviposition of Anoplophora glabripennis was discussed. In nature, arthropods may accumulate or acquire the conidia themselves from naturally occurring EPF, whereas in an agricultural scenario, this acquisition may be due to exposure to EPF-covered surfaces (e.g., soil, foliage, bark) [21,22]. Either way, the consequence may be transmission of conidia between males and females (see, for example [9,23\u201325]). Studies on horizontal transmission in weevils (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) are scarce. Gottwald and Tedders [26] measured the distance of colonies of B. bassiana and M. anisopliae growing in a soil environment from infected Curculio caryae (pecan weevil) cadavers and its effect on conidial transmission. A more recent study [23] evaluated horizontal transmission of M. anisopliae and B. bassiana to adults of Kuschelorhynchus macadamiae from other infected adults and conidiated cadavers. Interestingly, high rates of conidial transmission were found, but mortality rates depended on the environmental conditions [23]. Variation among M. anisopliae and B. bassiana isolates was examined with respect to mortality rates due to horizontal transmission between adults of the banana root borer Cosmopolites sordidus [24]. Previous studies on the interactions between R. ferrugineus and EPF have mainly evaluated virulence and efficacy toward adults and larvae by screening various EPF species and strains (reviewed in [27]). With respect to horizontal transmission, it was shown that adult weevils in contact with EPF conidia disseminate those conidia among the adults [27\u201330]. Though the dissemination of conidia between females and their progeny was not proven, Gindin et al. [11] proposed that RPW females that are contaminated with conidia may infect their progeny via egg contamination during the egg-laying process, but they were not able to prove it. They suggested that the futility of these infection attempts might be due to low inoculum levels, the oviposition medium used (sugarcane) or the use of a fungal formulation that was not appropriate for conidial transmission (i.e., spray application or contact with spores on the culture media). In the current study, we established an experimental setup that enables precise evaluation of conidia acquisition and dissemination and contamination of laying hole by: (a) applying higher inoculum levels (5 \u00d7 108 conidia mL\u22121, compared to 2\u20135 \u00d7 107 conidia mL\u22121), which maximized the chances of a large number of conidia being acquired and disseminated by the females; (b) using an inert material (foam) for the oviposition site, which enabled straightforward observation of the laying holes, eggs, larvae and conidia, and eliminated any possible inhibitory effects of nutrients in the egg-laying medium on host\u2013pathogen interactions. These modifications, followed by microscopy observations, enabled verifying conidial acquisition by the females and disseminating it from the surface into the laying holes and to the eggs. The dissemination of conidia from the oviposition site to the egg-laying hole and then to the eggs, via the female\u2019s laying activity, was evident and pronounced. This phenomenon resulted in a significant reduction in egg-hatching rates and increased larval mortality due to mycosis, while the adult females remained alive. In accordance with our results, previous studies found no effect of EPF treatment on the number of eggs laid by females [11,31,32]; although conidia adhered to the female weevil body parts, its fecundity was unaffected and mycosis was not observed. We suggest that either there was not enough inoculum to initiate such sublethal effects, or the abiotic conditions were not favorable for mycosis in the females. The type of fungal conidial preparation had a significant effect on hatching rates. Treating the oviposition surface with dry conidia resulted in lower egg hatch than treatment with a conidial suspension, but the microscopic evidence could not confirm higher dissemination rates. Similar observations have been made previously, where a dry conidial formulation resulted in higher transmission rates than inoculation with wet conidia for Ceratitis capitata adults [25]. Moreover, high efficacy of a sporulated-rice formulation was observed in field trials involving RPW [33] and the black palm weevil Rhynchophorus bilineatus [34]. Notably, in our study, dry and wet conidia originated from complete media; however, some differences may be attributed to the variation in growth conditions. In Aspergillus fumigatus, genes encoding adhesion factors were highly expressed in dormant dry conidia;\nJ. Fungi 2023, 9, 458 12 of 14\nthese adhesion factors play a role in conidial hydrophobicity and high adherence rate [35]. Thus, better acquisition and adhesion of fungal conidia in a dry formulation are likely the result of the conidia\u2019s surface biochemistry characteristics, which may be regulated to some extent by adhesion related genes. The results stemming from the current study not only prove conidial acquisition and dissemination by female weevils and their effect on egg-hatching rates and larval survival in RPW, but also determine the underlying mechanism of transmission from treated surface to the female weevils and their progeny. Conidial adhesion is a non-specific process, and it is not surprising that females were entirely covered by conidia [36]. During oviposition, the female weevil moves around on the oviposition surface in search of a spot to lay the egg. During that search, the female\u2019s legs are in contact with the conidia, which readily adhere to them. Once a suitable laying site is located, the female drills a hole using its mouthpart, resulting in further acquisition of conidia. As the mouthparts are pushed into the laying holes, the conidia are transmitted into it, as evidenced by the presence of conidia at up to a 15 mm depth following drilling of the holes and by the change in fluorescent intensity before and after drilling. The ovipositor is covered with conidia as well, thereby facilitating further conidial dissemination into the laying hole."

Consequently, the acquisition of the conidia by the RPW female led to mycosis in eggs and larvae. We demonstrate dissemination of conidia from the surface into the laying hole by the female mouthpart and ovipositor during egg-laying activity, resulting in pronounced egg and larval mortality. A dry formulation of M. brunneum conidia was more efficient at reducing egg hatch and larval survival, suggest better adhesion to the females. These results encourage the further evaluation of this unique mechanism of EPF dissemination into the egg-laying hole as a preventative measure in RPW management. We consider this mechanism as a venue to tackle other woodborers such as long-horned beetles, of which management is a challenge.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization: D.M.; Methodology: S.M., V.R., E.Y., N.L., C.K., E.B., N.B. and M.D.; Data curation: N.L., E.Y. and S.M.; Visualization: Alex Protasov, E.B. and G.M.; Formal analysis and investigation: N.L., V.R. and D.M.; Writing\u2014original draft preparation: D.M.; Writing\u2014review and editing: S.M. and V.R.; Funding acquisition: D.M.; Resources: A.P., E.B., M.D. and E.Y.; Supervision: D.M.
