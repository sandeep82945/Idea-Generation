The dynamical variables are matrix elements of N \u00d7 N matrix S with the property S = const \u00b7 S. The Lax pair with spectral parameter is constructed by means of a quantum Rmatrix satisfying the associative Yang-Baxter equation. Equations of motion for gl N Landau-Lifshitz model are derived from the Zakharov-Shabat equations. The model is simplified when rank(S) = 1. In this case the Hamiltonian description is suggested. The described family of models includes the elliptic model coming from GLN Baxter-Belavin elliptic R-matrix. In N = 2 case the widely known Sklyanin\u2019s elliptic Lax pair for XYZ Landau-Lifshitz equation is reproduced. Our construction is also valid for trigonometric and rational degenerations of the elliptic R-matrix. Introduction and notations The Landau-Lifshitz equation [9] is 1+1 field theory describing behaviour of the magnetization vector ~ S(t, x) = (S1, S2, S3) in one-dimensional model of ferromagnetic solid (x is a space variable on a unit circle and t is a time variable): \u2202t~ S = c\u03031~ S \u00d7 J(~ S) + c\u03032~ S \u00d7 \u2202 x~ S , J(~ S) = (J1S1, J2S2, J3S3) , (1) where c\u03031 , c\u03032 and J1 , J2 , J3 are some constants. The periodic boundary conditions ~ S(t, x) = ~ S(t, x+2\u03c0) are assumed. Also, for simplicity we deal with the complex version of (1) so that the dynamical variables (S1, S2, S3) and all the constants are C-valued (the reduction to real-valued case is available as well). The second term in the r.h.s. of (1) describes the spin exchange interaction, while the first one comes from the anisotropy. In the fully anisotropic case (when J1 , J2 , J3 are pairwise distinct) the model is referred to as XYZ type model, the partially anisotropic case (J1 = J2) is called XXZ, and the fully isotropic case (J1 = J2 = J3) is known as XXX model. In the latter case ~ S \u00d7 J(~ S) = 0 and (1) is reduced to the equation for 1+1 continuous classical XXX Heisenberg magnet. Equivalently, the Landau-Lifshitz equation (1) is written in the matrix form \u2202tS = c1[S, J(S)] + c2[S, \u2202 2 xS] , S = 3",

Integrability of (1)-(2) was established in [14] (see also [6]) in the sense of the classical inverse scattering method, which is based on representing a nonlinear equation(s) in the Zakharov-Shabat (or zero-curvature) form [18, 6]:\n\u2202tU(z)\u2212 \u2202xV (z) + [U(z), V (z)] = 0 , (3)\nwhere U(z), V (z) is a pair of matrix-valued functions of the variables t, x depending also on the spectral parameter z. In [14] the following Lax pair (or U -V pair) was suggested:\nU(z) =\n3 \u2211\nk=1\nSk\u03c3k\u03d5k(z) , V (z) =\n3 \u2211\nk=1\nSk\u03c3k \u03d51(z)\u03d52(z)\u03d53(z)\n\u03d5k(z) +\n3 \u2211\nk=1\nWk\u03c3k\u03d5k(z) , (4)\nwhere \u03d5k(z) is the following set of elliptic functions on elliptic curve with moduli \u03c4 (with Im(\u03c4) > 0):\n\u03d51(z) = e \u03c0\u0131z\u03c6(z,\n\u03c4 2 ) , \u03d52(z) = e \u03c0\u0131z\u03c6(z, 1 + \u03c4 2 ) , \u03d53(z) = \u03c6(z, 1 2 ) . (5)\nThe functions \u03d5k(z) are defined through the Kronecker elliptic function \u03c6(z, u) and the first Jacobi theta-function \u03d1(z):\n\u03c6(z, u) = \u03d1\u2032(0)\u03d1(z + u)\n\u03d1(z)\u03d1(u) , \u03d1(z) = \u03d1(z|\u03c4) = \u2212\n\u2211\nk\u2208Z\nexp\n(\n\u03c0\u0131\u03c4(k + 1\n2 )2 + 2\u03c0\u0131(z +\n1 2 )(k + 1 2 )\n)\n. (6)\nThe theta function is odd \u03d1(\u2212z) = \u2212\u03d1(z) and has simple zero at z = 0. Therefore, all \u03d5k(z) have simple pole at z = 0. Thus Res\nz=0 U(z) = S. Plugging the Lax pair (4) into equation (3) one gets two\ntypes of terms. The first type contains the first order pole at z = 0, and the second type \u2013 those terms with the second order pole at z = 0. These two types terms vanish separately since (3) is assumed to be valid identically in z. In this way we get two equations. From vanishing of the terms with the first order pole one gets3:\n\u2202tS = \u2202xT + [S, J(S)] , T =\n3 \u2211\nk=1\nTk\u03c3k , (7)\nwhere Jk = \u2118(\u03c9k). From vanishing of the terms with the second order pole we obtain\n\u2202xS = [S, T ] . (8)\nThe latter equation can be solved with respect to T . Since S is a traceless 2\u00d7 2 matrix, it satisfies the characteristic equation S2 = \u03bb212, where 12 = \u03c30 is the identity 2 \u00d7 2 matrix and \u03bb is an eigenvalue of S. Suppose \u2202x\u03bb = 0. This means that the length of vector ~S is constant along the x direction. Then, differentiating the characteristic equation with respect to x yields (\u2202xS)S + S(\u2202xS) = 0. One can easily verify that equation (8) has the following solution: T = 1\n4\u03bb2 [S, \u2202xS]. Plugging it into (7) we\nobtain the Landau-Lifshitz equation (2) with c1 = 1, c2 = 1/(4\u03bb 2).\nPurpose of the paper is to propose higher rank generalization of the above construction. For this purpose we represent the U -V pair in terms of R-matrix data. Let us demonstrate it for the above example. The classical gl2 elliptic r-matrix has the form:\nr12(z) = \u03c30 \u2297 \u03c30E1(z) + 3 \u2211\nk=1\n\u03c3k \u2297 \u03c3k \u03d5k(z) , E1(z) = \u03d1\u2032(z)\n\u03d1(z) . (9)\n3To derive (7) one should use the identities \u03d52k(z) = \u2118(z)\u2212\u2118(\u03c9k), where \u03c91 = \u03c4/2, \u03c92 = (\u03c4 +1)/2, \u03c93 = 1/2 and \u2118(z) is the Weierstrass \u2118-function.\nDefine\nU(z) = \u03c30S0E1(z) +\n3 \u2211\nk=1\n\u03c3kSk\u03d5k(z) (10)\nand notice that it differs from the one given in (4) by only the scalar term 12S0E1(z), which is not necessary since S0 = tr(S)/2 has trivial dynamics due to (2). The expression (10) is rewritten in terms of r-matrix (9):\nU(z) = U(S, z) = 1\n2 tr2\n( r12(z) 2 S ) , 2 S= 12 \u2297 S , S =\n3 \u2211\nk=0\n\u03c3kSk . (11)\nSimilarly, one can represent V (z) in the form4: V (z) = \u2212\u2202zU(S, z) +U(T, z). Therefore, the existence of the Zakharov-Shabat representation for the Landau-Lifshitz equations is based on some properties of the classical r-matrix (9) only. Below we suggest a universal construction based on certain properties of R-matrices, such as associative Yang-Baxter equation. In this way we describe not only elliptic model but also a family of trigonometric and rational models, which correspond to R-matrices satisfying the set of required relations."

With the normalization (13) we also\n4For this purpose one should use the identities \u2202z\u03d5i(z) = \u2212\u03d5j(z)\u03d5k(z) valid for any set of distinct i, j, k \u2208 {1, 2, 3}. 5Here {Eij ; i, j = 1...N} is the standard basis in N \u00d7N matrices Mat(N,C): (Eij)ab = \u03b4ia\u03b4jb. 6The exchanging of indices from 12 to 21 means the exchanging of the tensor components. For example, R~21(z) =\nP12R ~ 12(z)P12 = N\u2211\nijkl=1\nRij,kl(~, z)Ekl\u2297Eij , where P12 is the permutation operator. For any pair of N-dimensional vectors\nu, v the permutation operator acts as P12(u\u2297v) = v\u2297u. For any pair of N\u00d7N matrices A,B: P12(A\u2297B) = (B\u2297A)P12. Explicitly, P12 = N\u2211\ni,j=1\nEij \u2297 Eji.\nhave the property that R~12(z) has single simple pole in z at z = 0 and the residue is the permutation operator: Res\nz=0 R~12(z) = NP12. In the classical limit ~ \u2192 0 we have the expansion\nR~12(z) = 1\n~ 1N \u2297 1N + r12(z) + ~m12(z) +O(~2) , (15)\nwhere r12(z) is the classical r-matrix. Plugging (15) into (12) provides the classical Yang-Baxter equation [r12, r13] + [r12, r23] + [r13, r23] = 0 , rij = rij(zi \u2212 zj) . (16) The classical r-matrix has the following expansion near z = 0:\nr12(z) = 1\nz NP12 + r\n(0) 12 +O(z) . (17)\nDue to (14) one can easily get the (skew)symmetry properties for the coefficients of expansions (15) and (17):\nr12(z) = \u2212r21(\u2212z) , m12(z) = m21(\u2212z) , r(0)12 = \u2212r (0) 21 , m12(0) = m21(0) . (18)\nAssociative Yang-Baxter equation. Besides the quantum Yang-Baxter equation (12) (which is valid for any R-matrix) the R-matrices under consideration satisfy also the quadratic relation\nR~12R \u03b7 23 = R \u03b7 13R ~\u2212\u03b7 12 +R \u03b7\u2212~ 23 R ~ 13 , R x ab = R x ab(za \u2212 zb) (19)\nknown as the associative Yang-Baxter equation [7]. Together with (13) and (14) equation (19) provides the quantum Yang-Baxter equation (12), that is R-matrices under consideration belong to a special subset of quantum R-matrices, see details in [10, 11, 12]. As was shown in [13], the equation (19) degenerates in a certain limiting case into [m13(z1)+m23(z2), r12(z1\u2212z2)] = [m12(z1\u2212z2)+m13(z1), r23(z2)] and in the limit z2 \u2192 z1 one gets\n[m13(z), r12(z)] = [r12(z),m23(0)]\u2212 [\u2202zm12(z), NP23] + [m12(z), r(0)23 ] + [m13(z), r (0) 23 ] . (20)\nAnother important relation coming from (19) is as follows:\nr12(z)r13(z+w)\u2212 r23(w)r12(z) + r13(z+w)r23(w) = m12(z) +m23(w) +m13(z+w) . (21)\nIn particular, one can derive the classical Yang-Baxter equation (16) from (21) using the symmetry properties (18). We are going to use degeneration of (21) in the limit w \u2192 0:\nr12(z)r13(z) = r (0) 23 r12(z)\u2212 r13(z)r (0) 23 \u2212N\u2202zr13(z)P23 +m12(z) +m23(0) +m13(z) . (22)\nLax pairs and Zakharov-Shabat equation through R-matrices\nClassical mechanics of integrable top. We begin with the 0+1 example considered in [13]. Introduce\nL(S, z) = 1\nN tr2\n( r12(z) 2 S ) , M(S, z) = 1\nN tr2\n( m12(z) 2 S ) , 2 S= 1N \u2297 S (23)\nwhere S is an arbitrary N \u00d7N matrix, which matrix elements are dynamical variables in the model of integrable top. Equations of motion have the form S\u0307 = [S, J(S)], where\nJ(S) = 1\nN tr2\n( m12(0) 2 S ) =M(S, 0) . (24)\nIn order to show that the equations of motion are represented in the Lax for L\u0307(z) = [L(z),M(z)] one needs to compute [L(z),M(z)]. For this purpose we multiply both parts of (20) by 2 S 3 S and take trace (of both parts) tr2,3 over the second and the third tensor components. Then the last three commutators in the r.h.s. of (20) are cancelled out (see details in [13]) and one gets\n[L(S, z),M(S, z)] = L([S, J(S)], z) . (25)\nIn this way we conclude that the Lax equations hold true on the equations of motion. To prove converse statement we mention that for any matrix A the map A\u2192 L(A, z) is linear and L(A, z) = 0 iff A = 0.\nAnsatz for U-V pair. In contrast to the above example in mechanics, in 1+1 case the set of matrices of dynamical variables S is restricted by the following condition:\nS2 = cS , (26)\nwhere c \u2208 C is some constant. The condition (26) means that the eigenvalues of the matrix S are equal to either 0 or c. In particular case, when N \u2212 1 eigenvalues coincide, we come to the matrix S of rank 1. This case will be considered below separately.\nUsing the coefficient r (0) 12 in the expansion (17) introduce the following linear map:\nA\u2192 E(A) = 1 N tr2 ( r (0) 12 2 A ) , 2 A= 1N \u2297A , A \u2208 Mat(N,C) . (27)\nIt is important to mention that in the N = 2 case explicit evaluation provides r (0) 12 = 0, that is E(A) 6= 0 for the higher rank cases (N \u2265 3) only. Define\nU(z) = L(S, z) = 1\nN tr2\n( r12(z) 2 S ) , V (z) = V1(z) + V2(z) , (28)\nV1(z) = \u2212c\u2202zL(S, z) + L(SE(S), z) + L(E(S)S, z) , V2(z) = \u2212cL(T, z) . (29)\nDerivation of equations. Multiplying both sides of the identity (22) by 2 A 3 B and taking trace tr2,3 we get L(A, z)L(B, z) = L(AE(B), z) + L(E(A)B, z) \u2212 \u2202zL(AB, z)+\n+ tr(B)\nN M(A, z) +\ntr(A)\nN M(B, z) + 1N N tr23 ( m23(0) 2 A 3 B ) ,\n(30)\nwhere A,B \u2208 Mat(N,C) are arbitrary. Plugging A = B = S into (30) yields\nL2(S, z) = L(SE(S), z) + L(E(S)S, z) \u2212 \u2202zL(S2, z) + 2tr(S)\nN M(S, z) + 1N N tr23 ( m23(0) 2 S 3 S ) .\nTaking into account (26), this relation provides an alternative representation for V1(z) defined in (29):\nV1(z) = L 2(S, z) \u2212 2s0M(S, z) \u2212 1N N tr23 ( m23(0) 2 S 3 S ) , s0 = tr(S) N . (31)\nAlso, it is easy to see from (30) that\n[L(S, z), L(T, z)] = \u2212\u2202zL([S, T ], z) + L([S,E(T )], z) + L([E(S), T ], z) . (32)\nPlugging the ansatz for U -V pair (28)-(29) into the Zakharov-Shabat equation (3) we get\n\u2202tS + c\u2202xT \u2212 \u2202x(SE(S) + E(S)S) = 2s0[S, J(S)] + c[S,E(T )] + c[E(S), T ] (33)\nand \u2212\u2202xS = [S, T ] . (34) The last equation comes as vanishing of \u2202zL(\u2217, z) terms with the second order pole at z = 0, while (33) appears from vanishing of L(\u2217, z) terms with the first order pole at z = 0. Notice that for \u2202xV (z) term in the Zakharov-Shabat equation we used V1(z) as given in (29), and in the term [U(z), V (z)] we used V1(z) in the form (31). It is useful because from representation (31) we have [U(z), V1(z)] = \u22122s0[L(S, z),M(S, z)] (25) = \u22122s0L([S, J(S)], z). In order to solve (34) with respect to T we mention that (S \u2212 (c/2)1N )2 = (c/2)21N , that is similarly to N = 2 case we obtain T = \u2212c\u22122[S, \u2202xS] . (35)\nFinally, we substitute T from (35) to (33):\n\u2202tS \u2212 1\nc [S, \u22022xS]\u2212 \u2202x\n( SE(S)+E(S)S ) =2s0[S, J(S)]\u2212 1\nc [S,E([S, \u2202xS])]\u2212\n1 c [E(S), [S, \u2202xS]] , (36)\nwhere s0 = tr(S)/N . This is the higher rank Landau-Lifshitz equation. It is formulated through the linear maps J(S) (24), E(A) (27), which arise in the R-matrix expansions (15) and (17). The dynamical matrix S is assumed to satisfy condition (26) with some constant c."

Introduce the special matrix basis in Mat(N,C): Ta = Ta1a2 = exp ( \u03c0\u0131 N a1a2 ) Qa11 Q a2 2 , where a = (a1, a2) \u2208 ZN \u00d7 ZN , and (Q1)kl = \u03b4kl exp(2\u03c0\u0131N k), (Q2)kl = \u03b4k\u2212l+1=0modN . In particular, T(0,0) = 1N . The basis has the property tr(T\u03b1T\u03b2) = N\u03b4\u03b1+\u03b2,(0,0). See details in [3] (see also Appendix in [17]).

Another important remark is that in N = 2 case E(A) = 0 for any A \u2208 Mat2 since E1(1/2) = 0 and E1(\u03c4/2) = E1((\u03c4 + 1)/2) = \u2212\u03c0\u0131.\n7On should use the expansion of \u03c6(z, u) near u = 0: \u03c6(z, u) = u\u22121 +E1(z) + u\u03c1(z) +O(u 2).\nThe case rank(S) = 1\nIf rank(S) = 1 then the matrix S is represented as S = \u03be\u2297\u03c8, where \u03be and \u03c8 are N -dimensional vector column and row respectively. Then S2 = tr(S)S, so that c = tr(S) = Ns0 in (26) and (36).\nSpecial property and simplification. Up till now, we have not used one more property of the elliptic R-matrix (37). This is the Fourier symmetry (see e.g. [20]) R~12(z)P12 = R z/N 12 (N~). Using the expansions (15), (17) it provides the property r (0) 12 = r (0) 12 P12. Together with the skew-symmetry (18) it simplifies the Landau-Lifshitz equation (36) for the rank 1 case8. Namely, the following identity holds:\nc\u2202x\n( SE(S) + E(S)S )\n+ [E([S, \u2202xS]), S] + [[S, \u2202xS], E(S)] = 2c[E(\u2202xS), S] . (43)\nWe will give its proof in our future papers. Using (43) the Landau-Lifshitz equation (36) takes the form:\n\u2202tS = 1\nc [S, \u22022xS] +\n2c N [S, J(S)] \u2212 2[S,E(\u2202xS)] . (44)\nFor N = 2 case the last term in the r.h.s. vanishes and we come back to the original equation (2).\nHamiltonian description. The equation (44) can be easily described in the Hamiltonian formalism. The Poisson structure is given by\n{Sij(x), Skl(y)} = (Skj(x)\u03b4il \u2212 Sil(x)\u03b4kj)\u03b4(x \u2212 y) or { 1 S (x), 2 S (y)} = [P12, 1 S (x)]\u03b4(x \u2212 y) . (45)\nThe equations of motion \u2202tS(x) = {H,S(x)} provide (44) for the following Hamiltonian:\nH =\n\u222e\ndy ( c N tr ( S J(S) ) \u2212 1 2c tr ( \u2202yS \u2202yS ) + tr ( \u2202yS E(S) )) , S = S(y) .

            "text": "We described a special class of higher rank generalizations of the Landau-Lifshitz equation. Main idea was to use a set of R-matrix identities coming from the associative Yang-Baxter equation. As a result we deduce equations of motion (36) and the Lax pairs (28)-(29) with spectral parameter on elliptic curve (or its degeneration). In the particular case (rank(S) = 1) the equation (36) is simplified to (44). The latter admits quite simple Hamiltonian description (45)-(46).\nIt should be mentioned that the study of general matrix valued Lax pairs for the Zakharov-Shabat equation on elliptic curves is known from [4]. Notice that in the general case the Lax matrix has a set of poles (not a single one). Then the 1+1 Gaudin type models [19] arise. We hope our construction can be generalized to this case as well.\nExplicit formulae in the elliptic case are given in (37)-(42). Details of trigonometric and rational degenerations will be given in our next paper. The underlying finite-dimensional models (of type (23)- (25)) were studied in [1, 8, 10, 11]. N = 2 cases were considered in our previous paper [2], where a gauge equivalence between the Landau-Lifshitz equations and the 1+1 Calogero-Moser field theories was described. In view of similar relation between the XYZ chain and the Ruijsenaars-Schneider model [17] we also expect to extend our construction to (semi)discrete equations.\nThe Landau-Lifshitz equation (1) has multicomponent generalization suggested by I.Z. Golubchik, V.V. Sokolov [5] and T.V. Skrypnyk [15]. We hope to clarify relation of our construction to the results of [5] in our future works.\n8For example, in this way one can deduce the properties SE(S) = 0, SE((\u2202xS)S) = 0, SE(S(\u2202xS)) = \u2212c(\u2202xS)E(S)."
