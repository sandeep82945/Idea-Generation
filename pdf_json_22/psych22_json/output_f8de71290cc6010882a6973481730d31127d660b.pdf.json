    "abstractText": "Although previous research spared no efforts to explain the life satisfaction of marathon runners, little was known about the relationship between recreation specialization (RS), life satisfaction (LS), psychological commitment (PC), and social support (SS). This study examines (i) how the dimension of RS (i.e., behavior, cognition, and affect) influences runners\u2019 PC and LS, and (ii) the mediating effects of PC and the moderating effects of SS on the relationship between behavior, cognition, affect, and LS. The results showed that behavior (\u03b2 = 0.15, p < 0.01), cognition (\u03b2 = 0.35, p < 0.001), affect (\u03b2 = 0.28, p < 0.001), and PC (\u03b2 = 0.59, p < 0.001) had significant and positive impacts on runners\u2019 LS; PC (Indirect path coefficient = 0.09 ~ 0.20) mediated the relationship between the dimensions of RS and LS. In addition, the results also confirmed the moderating effects of SS (\u03b2 = 0.10, p < 0.05) between affect dimension and LS. These findings offered more evidence for understanding how RS dimensions and PC influence runners\u2019 LS. Future research should integrate runner\u2019s leisure experiences to better understand the results revealed in this study.",

This study examines (i) how the dimension of RS (i.e.,\nbehavior, cognition, and affect) influences runners\u2019 PC and LS, and (ii) the\nmediating effects of PC and the moderating effects of SS on the relationship\nbetween behavior, cognition, affect, and LS. The results showed that behavior (\u03b2 = 0.15, p < 0.01), cognition (\u03b2 = 0.35, p < 0.001), affect (\u03b2 = 0.28, p < 0.001), and PC (\u03b2 = 0.59, p < 0.001) had significant and positive impacts on runners\u2019 LS; PC (Indirect path coefficient = 0.09 ~ 0.20) mediated the relationship between\nthe dimensions of RS and LS. In addition, the results also confirmed the moderating effects of SS (\u03b2 = 0.10, p < 0.05) between affect dimension and LS. These findings offered more evidence for understanding how RS dimensions\nand PC influence runners\u2019 LS.

Individuals were keen to travel away from the place of residence, and regarded harvesting marathon event as a key leisure pursuit (Sato et\u00a0al., 2016). Previous studies found that marathon event brand and destination image were the significant predictors of runners\u2019 willingness to revisit (Hallmann and Breuer, 2010; Huang et\u00a0al., 2015). Moreover, other factors such as destination attachment, event satisfaction, and travel distance can also influence individual\u2019s behavioral intention (Hallmann and Wicker, 2012; Filo et\u00a0al., 2013).\nBryan (1977, 2000) developed a conceptual framework named \u201crecreation specialization (RS)\u201d to reflect various behaviors that people had showed during participating in leisure sport activities. Along with the progress of runner\u2019s leisure career, they usually exhibited a series of obvious characteristics related to RS. As mentioned in the study of Green and Jones (2005), sport tourism can provide serious participants with (i) a way to construct their leisure identity, (ii) a time and place to express them sharing the skill and knowledge of the activity, and (iii) a way to record their leisure career. Existing literature (Heo and Lee, 2010; Kim et\u00a0al., 2011; Yang et\u00a0al., 2019) also provided some evidence to support the role of RS on life satisfaction (LS). For example, Yang et\u00a0al. (2019) confirmed that the core devotees of sport club reported experiencing higher degree of happiness, life satisfaction, and health when compared to those moderate ones. In a longitudinal study, scholars indicated that distance running events participation exerted a positive influence on participants\u2019 evaluations toward their lives (Sato et\u00a0al., 2015).\nWhile the previous study indicated that RS had a direct effect on individual\u2019s leisure satisfaction (Matsumoto et\u00a0al., 2018; Kwon et\u00a0al., 2021) and subjective wellbeing (Tian et\u00a0al., 2020), few have examined the impact of RS as a multidimensional construct influencing marathon runners\u2019 LS, and little is known about the potential impact of the psychological commitment (PC) and social support (SS) on LS. Regarding the current dilemma, PC has been suggested as a key mediator in the relationship between leisure involvement and flow experience (Cheng et\u00a0al., 2016). PC reflects individual\u2019s loyalty to the activities in which they involve (Pritchard et\u00a0al., 1999). In other words, when people are seriously engaged in some leisure activities, they will gain a series of durable benefits which may contribute them to commit to those activities strongly (Stebbins, 2007; Cheng et\u00a0al., 2016). In addition, SS (e.g., from family or friends) was seen as a key factor that can negotiate individual\u2019s leisure constraints (Brown et\u00a0al., 2001). Usually, higher degree of SS may contribute to the role of RS on LS.\nTherefore, the objectives of this study are triple fold. The first is to access how the behavior, cognition, and affect dimensions of RS influence runners\u2019 LS. The second is to examine the mediating effect of PC on the relationship between dimensions of RS and LS. The third is to test the moderating effect of SS on the relationship between dimensions of RS and LS.\nLiterature review and development of hypotheses\nRecreation specialization and life satisfaction\nThe RS framework originated from Bryan (1977) was firstly used to explain recreational trout fishermen\u2019s attitudinal and behavioral differences. The essence of RS is that outdoor recreation participants usually progress along a continuum from general interest and low engagement to specialized interest and high engagement (Bryan, 2000). Since Bryan\u2019s original research, scholars had made great efforts on how to evaluate RS accurately. A three-dimension specialization model proposed by McIntyre and Pigram (1992) has been widely used, which included dimensions of behavior, cognition, and affect. The behavioral dimension measured prior experience with a specific activity and familiarity with a recreational setting (McIntyre and Pigram, 1992). The cognitive dimension referred to the level of self-assessed knowledge and skill that they have accumulated through significant personal efforts (Waight and Bath, 2014). The affective dimension was characterized by personal commitment and enduring involvement (Buchanan, 1985; McFarlane, 2004).\nRS has been successfully applied to examine within-group differences among participants in outdoor leisure sport activities, including marathon (Park et\u00a0 al., 2018), cycling (Lamont and Jenkins, 2013; Shafer and Scott, 2013), camping (McIntyre and Pigram, 1992; McFarlane, 2004), canoe (Wellman and Smith, 1982), and hikers (Kim and Song, 2017). For example, using a latent profile analysis, hikers were divided into three subgroups: novice, affection-driven, and expert; they exhibited significant difference on their satisfaction and revisit intention (Song et\u00a0al., 2018). In addition, previous studies also reported the role of RS as a dependent variable, an independent variable, or a mediating variable. For example, Cheung et\u00a0al. (2017) verified that a direct and positive impact was found between RS and pro-environmental attitudes among birdwatchers in Hong Kong.\nAlthough previous studies paid less attention to evaluate the role of RS on LS, they also provided some indirect and reliable evidence. A recent study confirmed a direct influence of RS on cycling participants\u2019 subjective wellbeing, a multidimensional construct consisted of LS, positive and negative experience (Tian et\u00a0al., 2020). Enduring involvement, seen as affective dimension of RS by McIntyre and Pigram (1992), had a positive direct effect on LS among 10-mile running participants (Sato et\u00a0 al., 2018). Moreover, serious participants reported experiencing higher degree of LS and perceived health than the casual participants (Kim et\u00a0al., 2011; Heo et\u00a0 al., 2013). In other words, as the level of behavior, cognition, and affect improved continuously in physical active leisure activities, people would be\u00a0inclined to report a higher satisfaction with life.\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\nRecreation specialization and psychological commitment\nCommitment refers to a process through which an individual becomes dedicated to organize the patterns of their leisure behavior for expressing their needs (Buchanan, 1985). PC was defined as \u2018a tendency to be\u00a0 devoted to individual\u2019s activities participation despite alternative options are available\u2019 (Pritchard et\u00a0al., 1999; Lee and Kyle, 2014). It was seen as an essential element for understanding why individuals choose to participate in a specific leisure activity, or revisit particular places (Backman and Crompton, 1991; Pritchard et\u00a0al., 1999). Previous studies came to an agreement on dividing PC into four major dimensions: resistance to change, position involvement, volitional choice, and informational complexity (Pritchard et\u00a0 al., 1999; Iwasaki and Havitz, 2004).\nAs is known to us, individuals may experience complex and sequential psychological processes before becoming loyal participants (Iwasaki and Havitz, 1998).\nA previous study indicated that individuals can experience some positive psychological states (e.g., wellbeing and contemplation) from the activities through conquering adversity, and accumulating knowledge, skill, or experience (Stebbins, 2018). In a qualitative research, scholar found that degree of RS acted as a predictor of event attendance, and individuals usually negotiated constraints (e.g., low confidence and no partner) in order to commit to event attendance (Lewis and Moital, 2013). Moreover, Cheng et\u00a0al. (2016) confirmed that higher enduring involvement (e.g., attraction, self-expression, and centrality to lifestyle) can lead to a higher level of PC by employing a structural equation modeling. Kyle et\u00a0al. (2004) also indicated that when tourists exhibited higher degree of leisure involvement, they would exhibit strong PC to the activity and place. Based on the statement above, this study deduces that when individuals continuously involved in marathon running, they will accumulate related experiences, identify their preference, and develop a commitment to the activity.\nPsychological commitment and life satisfaction\nPrevious studies indicated that serious engagement in physically active activities often gained higher level of life satisfaction and health (Kim et\u00a0 al., 2011; Heo et\u00a0 al., 2013). Considering the essence of PC, \u201ccontinuity\u201d and \u201cresistance to change,\u201d participants with higher degree of PC always acquired many durable benefits as the leisure career processed (Stebbins, 2007). In a longitudinal study, Sato et\u00a0al. (2015) proposed that achievement and positive experience through running event engagement would be\u00a0 help for evaluating individual\u2019s life satisfaction. In other words, when individuals are strongly psychological commit to marathon events participation, they believe that it can contribute to own a higher LS.\nMediating role of psychological commitment\nPrevious studies paid great attention to examine the mediating role of individual\u2019s PC on the relationship between leisure involvement and behavioral loyalty (Iwasaki and Havitz, 2004; Kyle et\u00a0al., 2004). For example, Kyle et\u00a0al. (2004) confirmed that dimension of PC had an indirect effect between leisure involvement and behavioral loyalty among hikers along the Appalachian Trail. Bodet (2012) suggested that PC played a mediating role on the relationship between enduring involvement and loyalty in sport participation services. However, they ignored to explore the influence of PC between dimensions of RS and LS.\nExisting literature suggested that physically active leisure can improve participants\u2019 quality of life through providing positive experiences, such as psychological involvement and flow experience (Sato et\u00a0al., 2014; Cheng et\u00a0al., 2016). As discussed in previous paragraphs, dimensions of RS (i.e., behavior, cognition, and affect) may have a positive impact on PC and LS (Kyle et\u00a0al., 2004; Heo et\u00a0al., 2013; Cheng et\u00a0al., 2016; Sato et\u00a0al., 2018); PC may positively associate with LS (Sato et\u00a0 al., 2015). Based on the statement above, this study suggested that runners will commit to engage in marathon event tourism as degree of their RS increases. They will conquer the difficulties and constraints, develop a higher PC, and gain more positive experience and durable outcome related to LS."

            "text": "SS generally refers to the \u2018process of interaction in relationship which improve, coping, esteem, belong, and competence through actual or perceived exchanges of physical of psychosocial resources\u2019 (Gottlieb, 2000). SS can contribute to individual\u2019s health outcome by modifying the effects of a stressful situation or impacting on health directly (House et\u00a0al., 1988; Thoits, 1995). According to this opinion, SS can encourage individuals to maintain and initiate running activities by psychological variables such as self-efficacy. It also suggested that SS can provide important information or material resources which can increase degrees of participation. In addition, previous studies also suggested dimensions of RS may influence the evaluation of individual\u2019s LS (Kim et\u00a0al., 2011; Heo et\u00a0al., 2013). Considering these arguments above, the current study proposes that SS can strength the relationship between behavior, cognition, affect, and LS.\nIn this study, we\u00a0aimed at examining the relationship between dimensions of RS, PC, LS, and SS among Chinese marathon tourists.

The statement for affect was as follows: \u201cIf stopped running, I\u00a0would lose touch with my friends.\u201d Both the\nbehavioral and cognitive dimensions were rated on a 5-point Likert scale where \u201c1\u201d represents \u201cnovice\u201d and \u201c5\u201d represents \u201cexpert.\u201d The affect dimension was assessed with a 5-point Likert scale where \u201c1\u201d represents \u201cdisagree strongly\u201d and \u201c5\u201d represents \u201cagree strongly.\u201d\nSatisfaction With Life Scale (SWLS) which developed by Diener et\u00a0al. (1985) was applied to measure the degree which a person positively evaluates the overall quality of his/her life. The Chinese-version SWLS was confirmed with good reliability and validity by Xiong and Xu (2009). The scale consists of five items with 7-point Likert scale where \u201c1\u201d represents \u201cdisagree strongly\u201d and \u201c7\u201d represents \u201cagree strongly.\u201d The statement for LS was as follows: \u201cIn most ways my life is close to my ideal.\u201d\nPsychological Commitment Scale (PCS), modified from Pritchard et\u00a0al. (1999) and Kyle et\u00a0al. (2004), was used to measure the extent of commitment for marathon runners. A recent study reported that this scale appeared to exhibit satisfactory measurement qualities (Cheng et\u00a0al., 2016). It included 10 items, covering four dimensions: resistance to change (3 items), position involvement (3 items), volitional choice (2 items), and information complexity (2 items). The statement for resistance to change was as follows: \u201cMy preference to participate in running will not willingly change.\u201d A 7-point Likert scale was used where \u201c1\u201d represents \u201cdisagree strongly\u201d and \u201c7\u201d represents \u201cagree strongly.\u201d\nThe Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), developed by Zimet et\u00a0al. (1988), was applied to measure the respondent\u2019s social support. The MSPSS consisted of 12 items, reducing to three dimensions: significant other (4 items), friends (4 items), and family (4 items). The statement for significant other was as follows: \u201cThere is a special person in my life who cares about my feelings.\u201d The MSPSS was rated with a 7-point Likert scale where 1 represents \u201cdisagree strongly\u201d and 7 represents \u201cagree strongly.\u201d\nAccording to the experiences of existing literature (Qiu et\u00a0al., 2020; Tian et\u00a0 al., 2022), five demographic variables and a behavioral variable were introduced as covariate variables in the\nFIGURE\u00a01 Proposed conceptual model.\nFrontiers in Psychology 05 frontiersin.org\nproposed model.

This event was recently certified as a world athletics elite platinum label event by International Athletics Federation, and has successfully attracted over 15,000 participants every year since 2015. Based on the size of the event, this study distributes the questionnaire randomly (i.e., every 20th person) to marathon runners near the finish area. The respondents were suggested to sign the informed consent before they start to fill out the questionnaire. A total of 393 questionnaires were collected through sharing a QR code from a web-based platform (i.e., Questionnaire Star), but 34 of the sample were excluded from the data analysis according to Gibson\u2019s (1998) definition of sport tourism, because they were not temporarily outside of their home communities. Finally, 359 questionnaires were used to examine all the research hypotheses.\nSPSS 23.0 and JASP\u00a00.16 were performed to analyze the data in this study. Parametric analyses, seen as the standard tools of psychological statistics (Norman & Anderson, 1961), were \u201crobust\u201d as judged from the observation that parametric and non-parametric analyses lead to similar results regarding statistical significance (Mircioiu and Atkinson, 2017). So parametric procedure was used to examine related data in this study. Specifically, the respondent profile, mean, and standard deviations were evaluated by descriptive analysis. Reliability of all the variables in this study was accessed using Cronbach\u2019s alpha (CA). The correlation of all the variables was evaluated by Pearson\u2019s correlation coefficient. Confirmatory Factor Analysis in JASP was performed to test the convergent validity and discriminant validity of all the subscales. Regression analysis was applied to examine hypothesis 1 to hypothesis 7. Process V 4.0 developed by Hayes et\u00a0al. (2017) was used to decide hypothesis 8 to hypothesis 13."

As reported in Table\u00a0 2, the internal consistency values ranged from 0.72 to 0.95, indicative of reliable consistency among the items in each subscale (Nunnally and Bernstein, 1994). Convergent validity reflects the extent to which a set of items possess the properties expected of the focal construct (Nunnally, 1967; Bagozzi and Yi, 2012). Three indicators, including factor loading (FL), composite reliability (CR), and average variance extracted (AVE), were used to evaluate the convergent validity of each construct. As shown in Table\u00a02, the FLs for most items were high than 0.70 (i.e., 0.74 to 0.93), except for one item in the subscale of SS (FRI2 = 0.34). According to the suggestion of Hair et\u00a0al. (2011), when an item\u2019s FL is below 0.70, it should be\u00a0removed from the scale for increasing the CR. In this study, the reported CR values ranged from 0.71 to 0.92, and the AVE values ranged from 0.55 to 0.90. These indicators met the acceptable threshold of an AVE value higher than 0.50 (Barclay et\u00a0al., 1995) and a CR value higher than 0.70 (Fornell and Larcker, 1981).\nTable\u00a0 3 presents the results of descriptive statistics and discriminant validity for each subscale.

            "text": "The multiple regression was performed to examine the hypothesis 1 to hypothesis 7. The statistical results confirmed that behavior (\u03b2 = 0.15, p <\u00a00.01), cognition (\u03b2 = 0.35, p < 0.001), affect (\u03b2 = 0.28, p < 0.001), and PC (\u03b2 = 0.59, p < 0.001) have positive and significant effects on LS. Thus, hypotheses H1, H2, H3, and H7 are supported. Similarly, the results confirmed that behavior (\u03b2 = 0.22, p < 0.001), cognition (\u03b2 = 0.38, p\u00a0 < 0.001), and affect (\u03b2 = 0.43, p < 0.001) have positive and significant impacts on PC. These findings support hypotheses H4 to H6.\nThe mediating role of psychological commitment\nAs Table\u00a04 illustrates, the indirect effects were estimated and the 95% confidence intervals were calculated. Specifically, the mediating role of PC on the relationship between behavior, cognition, affect, and LS was significant as zero was not included in any of the confidence intervals. That is (a*b = 0.09, LB = 0.05, UB = 0.14), (a*b = 0.14, LB = 0.08, UB = 0.20), and (a*b = 0.20, LB = 0.11, UB = 0.29), respectively. Following the suggestion of Wen and Ye (2014), it was confirmed that PC fully mediated the relationship between behavior, cognition, and LS. However, PC partially mediated only the relationship between affect and LS. Therefore,\nthese findings indicate that PC has a mediating effect between behavior, cognition, affect, and LS, confirming hypotheses H8 to H10.\nThe moderate role of social support\nThe moderation role of SS on the relationship between dimensions of RS and LS was tested as shown in Table\u00a05. For analysis, three interaction variables were produced, including SS \u00d7 behavior, SS \u00d7 cognition, and SS \u00d7 affect. According to the results, the effect of SS \u00d7 affect on LS was significant (\u03b2 = 0.10, p < 0.05). However, the effect of SS \u00d7 behavior (\u03b2 = 0.03, p >\u00a00.05) and SS \u00d7 cognition (\u03b2 = 0.06, p > 0.05) on LS was not significant. In other words, SS can significantly promote the relationship between affect and LS. While SS did not provide any significant impact for the role of behavior and cognition on LS."

Activity theory claimed that the amount or frequency of activity participation and the level of attachment related to an activity could impact a person\u2019s LS (Lemon et\u00a0al., 1972). This research also extended to understand the antecedent factors of LS. As mentioned in previous studies, when individuals exhibited a serious level of behavioral engagement, knowledge acquirement, and emotional attachment, their LS always increased correspondingly (Kim et\u00a0al., 2011; Heo et\u00a0al., 2013).\nAccording to study results, RS dimensions were significantly and positively related to runners\u2019 PC. The results enrich existing research of Kyle et\u00a0 al. (2004), Cheng et\u00a0 al. (2016), and Ridinger et\u00a0 al. (2012), which confirmed that tourists showed strong PC to their pursuits when they presented a high level of leisure involvement. Recent suggested that individual\u2019s self-discipline behavior and curiosity on activity can make them acquire a series of physical, psychological, and social benefits, which may indirectly strengthen their degree of PC (Stebbins, 2018). Moreover, the findings of this study provided some supports to Sato et\u00a0al. (2015) and Stebbins (2007) finding that positive experience was positively associated with people\u2019s LS.\nStudy results revealed that runners\u2019 PC can play a mediating effect between RS dimensions and LS. Previous research have confirmed the mediating role of PC between leisure involvement and flow experience, and consumer loyalty (Iwasaki and Havitz, 2004; Bodet, 2012; Cheng et\u00a0 al., 2016). By developing a structural modeling, Lee and Scott (2006) suggested that as individual became increasing specialized, the benefits they obtained far outweighed any costs they might experience along the way. In addition, high quality of life is always rooted in a capacity to search deep satisfaction and fulfillment through experiencing with serious leisure to eventually carve out an optimal leisure lifestyle (Stebbins, 2007). Therefore, the findings in this study contribute to understand the connection between RS dimensions and LS, especially the indirect effect of PC on the relationship between behavior, cognition and LS.\nExtending to previous study (Ricciardo et\u00a0al., 2006), this study demonstrated that affect dimension interacted with SS when it predicted individual\u2019s LS. Existing literature confirmed that positive social influences had a positive influence on individual\u2019s negotiation efforts among the process they become specialized (Kim et\u00a0al., 2019), they played a key role in achieving diverse durable benefits and developing unique leisure identities (Lyu and Oh, 2015). Therefore, higher social support can strengthen the positive role of affect dimension on runner\u2019s LS. However, SS did not significantly moderate the role of behavior and cognition on runners\u2019 LS. In other words, individuals may use other negotiation strategies related to intrapersonal and structural constraints for pursuing a satisfied life when they processed toward a higher level of specialization (Park et\u00a0al., 2017).\nAlthough this study provides valuable insight into the relationship between dimension of RS, PC, LS, and SS in a leisure background, there are some limitations as follows. First, the findings in this study were confirmed under the background of COVID-19 pandemic, which has impacted all aspects of individual\u2019s everyday life, especially the experience of event participant and evaluation on their life. Hence, the results should be\u00a0 re-examined after conquering the COVID-19 pandemic. Second, while the proposed conceptual model has been carefully designed, this study may still ignore variables such as self-efficacy, leisure motivation, and leisure constraints. It should explore the influence of these variables on the theoretical framework in the future. Third, this study collected data from a random convenience sample of marathon runners in Xiamen Marathon Event. Future study should recruit the respondents from a wider geographic area and other types of activities."

            "text": "Physically active leisure plays an important role in promoting individual\u2019s LS (Sato et\u00a0al., 2015, 2018). Study results contributed to existing literature by confirming the positive influence of behavior, cognition, affect, PC on runners\u2019 LS, and the moderating role of SS with affect on runners\u2019 LS. Considering the normalization of the COVID-19 pandemic, these results could open a new door to the leisure and recreation manager, marathon event organizer, and marathon participants for weaving a satisfied everyday life.\nFrom a theoretical perspective, the findings support the positive impact of physically active leisure participation on experiencing higher level of LS. These results also extended the existing literature (Kim et\u00a0al., 2011; Sato et\u00a0al., 2018) by examining the mediating effect of PC, and the moderating role of SS. In addition, they also contribute to understand the predictors and influential paths of LS. From a practical perspective, individuals can experience a high degree of LS from being specially engaged in physically active leisure. In terms of individuals, they should make significant personal effort to conquer adversity, accumulate knowledge and skill, and form a long-lasting leisure career. For providers of leisure sport service, improving the quality of events, popularizing the sport skill and knowledge, and encouraging social group culture may be\u00a0the best way for improving individual\u2019s LS."
