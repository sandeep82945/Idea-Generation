            "text": "The current reality in the corporate world demands enterprises to be agile in every aspect. This implies agility as an organization, agility in responding to changes, and agility in strategy and execution. All this culminates in agility in delivering products (solutions) to the customer, which has fostered development of a myriad of agile frameworks and agile development approaches. However, agile practice is often driven by mere pragmatics and relevance, that is, applying agile with little research and, often, little rigor. This presents opportunities for researchers to look at the agile field through the lens of research and bring more rigor to it.\nThe experience of recent years shows that software engineering or any system development has an essential intersection with business engineering, management consulting, customer engagement, and many more. This makes modern software or any system development a cross-functional activity, and this recognition brings software engineering beyond merely writing program code. In fact, agile practice emphasizes that requirements emerge as the software system goes through the development process. Agile practice does not even assume that the requirements must be completely and accurately identified at the beginning of the development life cycle, but rather continuously explored.\nThe International Workshop on Model-driven Organizational and Business Agility (MOBA) was launched in 2021 with the purpose of encouraging scientific inquiries into agile practice and agility in a wider context, that is, an entire enterprise. In doing so, the role of models and modeling was especially taken into the focus.\nThe central tenet of an agile mindset is to develop a capability to rapidly respond to changes and to reduce uncertainty by iteratively exploring the solution context and scope and incrementally delivering value to the customer. In this sense, agile practice has equal merit whether developing an IT application, i.e., software engineering, or non-IT functions such as marketing, operations, human resources, legal work, etc. However, in its current state, agile practice is predominantly applied in the IT domain as it is applied in all stages of the life cycle of modern IT systems. As such, only a fraction of the true potential that agile practice can bring to enterprises is utilized. Therefore, the vast unexplored opportunities and the corresponding stasis in agile practice would greatly benefit from scientific inquiry, research, and rigorous solutions.\nTo explore these opportunities and address the potential challenges, the MOBA workshop aims at developing a multi-disciplinary community of researchers and practitioners, which will consolidate the effort in detecting, modeling, improving, and disseminating rigorous agility practices and theories. In this regard, various agility phenomena will be studied from a systemic viewpoint, distinguishing between endogenous agility inside an organization and exogenous agility in the form business connections with external parties. Common principles of model-driven research and engineering of organizational or technical artefacts will guarantee consistency and interoperability of the results obtained.\nvi Preface\nTo model and study organizational and business agility in a system context we inevitably should join together many adjacent topics such as enterprise architecture, semantic interoperability, model-driven design of information systems, models validation, business value co-creation, and more.\nAs a community, MOBA aims to become an incubator and platform for nascent and innovative ideas that are in their infancy and need expert discussion, insights, and critical evaluation by peers. In this sense,MOBA facilitates the participation and success of junior researchers. This year, MOBA continued its Master and Doctoral Consortium, which attracted young researchers to present and discuss theirwork, and receive feedback and inspiration from peers.\nMOBA 2022 was held in conjunction with the 34th International Conference on Advanced Information Systems Engineering (CAiSE 2022) and took place during June 6\u20137, 2022. The workshop received 22 submissions, and each paper underwent tripleblind peer reviews by 3 members of the Program Committee. As a result, 10 papers were accepted for presentation at the workshop and publication in this proceedings volume. In addition, one keynote paper is included.\nThe MOBA 2022 organizers would like to express their sincere thanks to the emergingMOBA community: the authors, the Program Committee, and the CAiSE organizers and chairs for their enthusiasm and devotion, as well as all participants for their contributions. We are already looking forward to the next edition of MOBA to meet again and bring new researchers!\nJune 2022 Eduard Babkin Joseph Barjis\nPavel Malyzhenkov Vojte\u030cch Merunka"
