One such hypothetical protein, BPSL1038, is conserved across\nseven bacterial genera and 654 Burkholderia spp. Here, we present a 1.55 \u00c5 resolution crystal\nstructure of BPSL1038. The overall structure folded into a modified \u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1 ferredoxin fold similar to known Cas2 nucleases. The Cas2 equivalent catalytic aspartate (D11) pairs are\nconserved in BPSL1038 although B. pseudomallei has no known CRISPR associated system.\nFunctional analysis revealed that BPSL1038 is a nuclease with endonuclease activity towards\ndouble-stranded DNA. The DNase activity is divalent ion independent and optimum at pH 6.\nThe concentration of monovalent ions (Na+ and K+) is crucial for nuclease activity. An active\nsite with a unique D11(X20)SST motif was identified and proposed for BPSL1038 and its\northologs. Structure modelling indicates the catalytic role of the D11(X20)SST motif and that\nthe arginine residues R10 and R30 may interact with the nucleic acid backbone. The structural\nsimilarity of BPSL1038 to Cas2 proteins suggests that BPSL1038 may represent a sub-family\nof nucleases that share a common ancestor with Cas2.\nhttps://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-023-05265-4 OPEN\n1 Institute of Systems Biology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, UKM Bangi 43600 Selangor, Malaysia. 2 Department of Pathology, Faculty of Medicine and Health Sciences, Universiti Putra Malaysia, UPM Serdang 43400 Selangor, Malaysia. 3 Centre for Chemical Biology, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Bayan Lepas 11900 Penang, Malaysia. 4 Diamond Light Source, Harwell Science & Innovation Campus, Didcot, Oxfordshire OX11 0DE, UK. 5 Advanced Medical and Dental Institute, Universiti Sains Malaysia, Pulau Pinang, Malaysia. 6 Department of Biological Sciences and Biotechnology, Faculty of Science and Technology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, UKM Bangi 43600 Selangor, Malaysia. 7Medicinal Mushroom Research Group (MMRG), Department of Molecular Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, University of Malaya, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. 8Malaysia Genome and Vaccine Institute, National Institutes of Biotechnology Malaysia (NIBM), Jalan Bangi, Kajang 43000 Selangor, Malaysia. 9 Department of Applied Physics, Faculty of Science and Technology, Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, UKM Bangi 43600 Selangor, Malaysia. 10Present address: Department of Biochemistry, University of Cambridge, Cambridge CB2 1GA, UK. 11Present address: Faculty of Health and Life Sciences, Inti International University, Persiaran Perdana, BBN, Nilai 71800 Negeri Sembilan, Malaysia. 12These authors contributed equally: Sofiyah Shaibullah, Nurshahirah Shuhaimi. \u2709email: clng@ukm.edu.my\nCOMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | (2023) 6:920 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-023-05265-4 | www.nature.com/commsbio 1\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\nB urkholderia pseudomallei (BP) is a pathogenic Gram-negative soil bacterium that has been classified as a Tier 1select agent due to its biothreat potential for causing melioidosis, a disease with high fatality rates in humans and animals1. The bacterium is also highly resistant to clinically used antibiotics2. The genome size of B. pseudomallei strain K96243, an often used reference genome, is 7.24 Mbp and contains 5855 coding DNA sequences (CDSs), with approximately 25% of the genome annotated to encode for hypothetical proteins3,4.\nThe large number of genes encoding for proteins with unknown functions have posed a challenge in fully elucidating the details related to melioidosis pathogenesis to understand the bacterium\u2019s capacity to survive in various hostile environments and host organisms5,6. Many B. pseudomallei hypothetical proteins are conserved throughout the Burkholderiaceae family.\nOne such protein, BPSL1038, is found in at least 654 members of the family with available genomes (https://www.burkholderia. com/orthologs/list?id=371057)4. This number accounts for species that are known pathogens as well as those that are not known to be pathogenic. In the GenBank non-redundant protein sequence (nr) database (27th April 2023), 249 orthologous sequences of BPSL1038 in the Burkholderiaceae family from the genera Burkholderia, Paraburkholderia, Caballeronia, Trinickia, Robbsia, Pararobbsia, Mycetohabitans and Mycoavidus were retrievable. In addition to the Burkholderiaceae family, homologs from Pseudomonas and Bacillus are also in the database, indicating that this protein is prevalent in nature and not unique to only the Burkholderiaceae family (Supplementary Fig. 1). The highly conserved nature of BPSL1038 in Burkholderiaceae and its presence in other bacterial families, despite having no detectable sequence orthologs of known functions, prompted us to investigate its function using a structure-guided characterization approach.\nHere, we report the crystal structure of BPSL1038 that shares high structural similarities to Cas2 (CRISPR-associated protein 2) and VapD (virulence-associated protein D) proteins. Functional assays demonstrated that BPSL1038 has nuclease activity. Our structural analysis was able to identify an active site and from there allowed us to propose a potential mechanism of how the protein interacts with and cleaves its nucleic acid substrate."

            "text": "Overall structure of BPSL1038. The crystal structure of recombinant BPSL1038 (rBPSL1038) protein (~12 kDa) was determined by the single wavelength anomalous (SAD) dispersion method using the SeMet-BPSL1038 protein. The SeMet-BPSL1038 (smBPSL0138) and native BPSL1038 (rBPSL1038) crystals diffracted to 1.88 \u00c5 and 1.55 \u00c5 resolution, respectively. Both crystals belong to space group C2221 with similar unit cells (Table 1). The rBPSL1038 crystals contain two protein molecules per asymmetric unit forming a symmetric homodimer. The homodimeric structure of smBPSL0138 and rBPSL1038 show that both structures are almost identical with a root mean square deviation (r.m.s.d) of 0.15 \u00c5 over 187 C\u03b1 atoms (Supplementary Fig. 2a). The structure of each rBPSL1038 protomer adopted a modified \u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u03b1 ferredoxin fold (Fig. 1). The \u03b11 helix (residues 1\u201372) is flanked by two 310-helices while the \u03b13 helix is appended at the C-terminal region (residues 76\u201386). The long \u03b24 strand (residues 61\u201371) contains a kink at residue T67 that results in a sharp curved shape. One end of the \u03b24 strand (residues 61\u201367) from one protomer forms an anti-parallel \u03b2-sheet with the end of the \u03b24 strand (residues 68\u201371) of the other protomer, assembling the dimerization backbone of the BPSL1038 dimer. The \u03b24 strand further forms a five-stranded antiparallel \u03b2-sheet together with four \u03b2-strands from the other protomer. Overall, protomer A has\na well-ordered fusion 6xHis-tag (13 amino acids) at the N-terminal region with residues -11 to -8 forming an additional \u03b21 strand (Fig. 1). The \u03b21 strand forms an anti-parallel \u03b2-sheet with strand \u03b24. Both subunits (residues 1\u201387) are highly similar with an r.m.s.d of 1.3 \u00c5 over 87 C\u03b1 atoms (residues 1\u201387); the biggest deviation was observed at loop L4 and helix \u03b13 regions and is likely due to the existence of the fusion His-tag \u03b21 strand that interacts with the \u03b24 strand of protomer A (Supplementary Fig. 2b). The SEC analysis of rBPSL1038 with and without the N-terminus 6X-His fusion tag was found to be very similar, suggesting that the BPSL1038 dimer is stable without the ordered \u03b21-\u03b24 anti-parallel \u03b2-sheet in protomer A that was observed in the crystal structure (Supplementary Fig. 3).\nIn addition to the anti-parallel \u03b24 sheet, the BPSL1038 dimer interface includes \u03b21 to \u03b71 (residues 6\u201311), \u03b22 to \u03b23 (residues 31\u201337), \u03b12 helix (residues 44, 45, 48 and 52), \u03b12-\u03b24 loop, and \u03b13 helix with a total calculated buried interface area of 1494 \u00c52. This accounts for ~25% of the protomer surface area and involves mainly hydrophobic interactions in addition to 16 hydrogen bonds and one salt bridge. In total, 42% (37 residues) of the total amino acid content is associated with dimerization. A Complex Formation Significance Score (CSS) of 0.855 from PISA interface analysis indicates that BPSL1038 is a stable dimer, that agrees with our previous report7.\nAnalysis of structure homologs. A DALI server search8,9 identified proteins or domains with ferredoxin-like folds as having detectable and significant fold similarity to the BPSL1038 protomer despite having very low sequence identity (5\u201316%). Among the ferredoxin-like folds retrieved by DALI are the domain III of elongation factor 2 from Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens and Pyrococcus horikoshii (Z-score 7.6, PDB ID 6U45 and 5H71 r.m.s.d ~3.0 \u00c5), the domain III of ribosome maturation protein SDOI homolog (Z-score 7.5, PDB ID: 2WBM r.m.s.d 3.5 \u00c5), LepA (Z-score 7.3, PDB ID 3CB4 r.m.s.d 2.6 \u00c5) and several CRISPR-associated Cas2 proteins from Thermococcus onnurineus (Z-score 7.05, PDB ID: 5G4D r.m.s.d 3.0 \u00c5), Pyrococcus furiosus DSM 3638 (Z-score ~7.5, PDB ID: 4TNO and 2I0X r.m.s.d ~ 3.0 \u00c5) and Thermus thermophilus (Z-score 7.3, PDB ID: 1ZPW r.m.s.d 2.9 \u00c5).\nFurther pairwise structure comparisons of the results retrieved by DALI found that the overall homodimeric folding of BPSL1038 is very similar to those of homodimeric CRISPRassociated Cas2 proteins from Pyrococcus furiosus (PDB IDs: 4TNO and 2I0X, r.m.s.d of 2.9 \u00c5 over 144 aligned C\u03b1 atoms); Thermus thermophilus (PDB ID: 1ZPW, 2.5 \u00c5 r.m.s.d over 142 aligned C\u03b1 atoms), Thermococcus onnurineus (PDB ID: 5G4D, r.m.s.d 2.9 \u00c5 over 135 aligned C\u03b1 atoms); and Streptococcus pyogenes serotype M1 (PDB ID: 4QR2, r.m.s.d 3.3 \u00c5 over 135 aligned C\u03b1 atoms) (Supplementary Fig. 4).\nSequence and structure comparison of BPSL1038 and CRISPRassociated Cas2 proteins. Multiple sequence alignment using CLUSTAL W showed that despite low sequence similarity between BPSL1038 and Cas2 proteins retrieved by DALI (10\u201315%), several conserved residues in Cas2 are aligned (Fig. 2a). Most of these residues (I7, V8, L20, L31, S32, T34, A35, W36, L52, V55, L61, F64) are structurally important for either dimerization or intramolecular hydrophobic interaction within a protomer. D11 is highly conserved among the Cas2 proteins and proposed to form a residue pair with the D11 side chain from a different dimer chain, which together, chelate specific divalent metal ions which are important for nuclease activities. The phylogenetic relationship analysis of BPSL1038 with CRISPRassociated Cas2 proteins and VapD protein using Neighbour-\n2 COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | (2023) 6:920 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-023-05265-4 | www.nature.com/commsbio\nJoining indicates that BPSL1038 is more similar to the VapD protein from Helicobacter pylori (Hpy_VapD) than other CRISPR-Cas2 associated proteins (Fig. 2b).\nOverall structure comparisons of BPSL1038 with Cas2 and Hpy_VapD proteins revealed substantial structural differences at \u03b11, loop \u03b21-\u03b11, loop \u03b12-\u03b24, \u03b24 and the C-terminal regions although all structures adopted the conserved \u03b2\u03b1\u03b2\u03b2\u03b1\u03b2 ferredoxin fold (Fig. 2c). In BPSL1038, \u03b1-3101 accommodates the active site residue D11, while the equivalent residue in Cas2 protein is generally located at the \u03b21 region (Figs. 1, 3). As a result, BPSL1038 has a short and rigid \u03b21-\u03b11 turn compared to Cas2 proteins such as Bha_Cas2, Spy_Cas2 and Xal_Cas2 that are\nCOMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | (2023) 6:920 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-023-05265-4 | www.nature.com/commsbio 3\nknown to cleave dsDNA10\u201312 (Fig. 3). The larger and flexible \u03b21\u03b11 loop was proposed as a DNA binding feature of Cas2 DNase as it can form a wider and shallower DNA binding groove10. BPSL1038 has a shorter \u03b12-\u03b24 loop, similar to known endoribonucleases such as Sso-Cas2 that are able to cleave ssRNA13. The long \u03b12-\u03b24 loop of Cas2 proteins was proposed as an RNA substrate recognition feature because it forms a deeper and narrower substrate binding groove that could accommodate ssRNA binding14. Nonetheless, Tth_Cas2 and several Cas2 proteins (Lin_Cas2, Afu_Cas2, Tma_Cas2 and Mth_Cas2) predicted to have a shorter \u03b12-\u03b24 loop also have RNase activity15. Hpy_VapD has a helix in this region and is able to cleave mRNA by purine-specific endoribonuclease activity16 (Fig. 3). Another significant structural difference between BPSL1038 and the Cas2 proteins is that BPSL1038 has a long \u03b24 strand with a kink in the middle, thus making it more like Hpy_VapD (Fig. 2c). A similar region in the homologs of Cas2 generally has either a 310-helix (Sso_Cas2, Spy_Cas2, Xal_Cas2 and Dvu_Cas2), an unstructured loop after a rather short \u03b24 strand (Bha_Cas2, Tth_Cas2, Ton_Cas2 and Pfu_Cas2) or a \u03b2 hairpin (Eco_Cas2) (Fig. 2c). The substrate induced conformational changes or motion of the \u03b24-\u03b25 hinge have been suggested to be important for the catalytic activation of Cas2 nucleases10\u201313,15,17.\nThe C-terminus of BPSL1038 is appended to an long \u03b13 helix that is absent in currently available Cas2 protein structures. The\nHpy_VapD structure has a short helix at the C-terminus (Figs. 2c, 3e). The C-terminal \u03b2 strand of Cas2 proteins is important for Cas1-Cas2 complex formation17\u201320. This suggests that BPSL1038 may adopt a different mechanism in complex formation if it is capable of forming a Cas1-Cas2-like complex. Although both BPSL1038 and Hpy_VapD share similar structural features at the \u03b24 strand and the C-terminus, BPSL1038 lacks the helices in the middle of loop \u03b21-\u03b11 and loop \u03b12-\u03b24 that are present in Hpy_VapD (Figs. 2c, 3e).\nThe crystal structure of Tth_Cas2 (Fig. 2c) and the predicted structure of Lin_Cas2 both have the short \u03b21-\u03b11 and \u03b12-\u03b24 loops; however, these proteins are able to cleave both DNA and RNA substrates10,15. Conversely, Cas2 proteins such as Dvu_Cas2 with long \u03b21-\u03b11 and \u03b12-\u03b24 loops and Ton_Cas2 with short \u03b21-\u03b11 and \u03b12-\u03b24 loops have no reported nuclease activity21,22, suggesting that Cas2 proteins can adopt a dynamic substrate-binding mode.\nStructural divergence among Cas2 proteins has been reported to play a crucial role in nuclease activity and substrate specificity. In this context, the BPSL1038 structure was shown to have a modified \u03b11 helix with an extended 310 helix at loop \u03b21-\u03b11 and a short \u03b12-\u03b24 loop suggesting that the signature structural features for DNA or RNA binding as shown in some Cas2 nucleases are not conserved in BPSL1038. Furthermore, the extended kinked \u03b24 strand of BPSL1038 results in it lacking the dynamic \u03b24-\u03b25 hinge region which previously described as playing an important\nmaritima, Ton: Thermococcus onnurineus, Tth: Thermus thermophilus, Xal: Xanthomonas albilineans. VapD is VapD protein. The multiple sequence alignment was performed using CLUSTAL W59 and the secondary structure was incorporated with ESPript 3.0. b The multiple sequence alignment results were used to obtain the phylogenetic relationship of BPSL1038 with CRISPR-associated Cas2 proteins and VapD protein using Neighbor-Joining60 within MEGA761. The optimal tree with the sum of branch length 24.97425156 is shown. The percentage of replicate trees in which the associated taxa clustered together in the bootstrap test (1000 replicates) are shown next to the branches62. The tree is drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Poisson correction method63 and are in the units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site. The analysis involved 15 amino acid sequences. All ambiguous positions were removed for each sequence pair. c Structure comparison of BPSL1038 and Cas2 homologs from four types of CRISPR-Cas systems.

Despite the low sequence similarity and substantial structural divergence between BPSL1038 and Cas2 proteins, the conserved residue D11 at 310 \u03b11 in BPSL1038 is coordinated closely to the equivalent aspartate residues at the \u03b21 strand of other Cas2 and VapD proteins that are central to catalysis (Figs. 1, 3). The aspartate pair has been proposed to coordinate with one divalent cation (Mg2+ or Mn2+) that are required to cleave phosphodiester bonds of DNA and RNA substrates10\u201313,15. In order to chelate the divalent cation, the distance between these two aspartate residues was proposed to be a crucial determinant of catalytic activity, where if they are too far apart, it would not be possible to chelate the metal ion10. To date, all existing Cas2 and VapD structures are suggested to be in the catalytically inactive conformation due to the aspartate pair being 6.5\u201315 \u00c5 apart, a distance that is unable to coordinate with the divalent metal ion10,12.\nIn BPSL1038, the aspartate (D11) pair is 5.9 \u00c5 apart and located together with the S32, S33 and T34 residues at the \u03b22-\u03b23 turn that forms a negatively charged cage for coordinating a water molecule that is tetrahedrally hydrogen bonded to residues S33 and T34 from both subunits (Fig. 4). It may be possible for the coordination of the water molecule in BPSL1038 to be substituted by a structurally equivalent divalent metal ion within the limits of small conformational changes in the active site if BPSL1038 functions as a divalent\nmetal ion-dependent nuclease. Interestingly, the \u03b22-\u03b23 turn forms an ST-turn motif with side chain oxygen atom of residue S32 hydrogen bonded to the main-chain NH of residue T3423. It is worth noting that the D11'(X20)SST potential nuclease active site motif is conserved across all aligned homologs in Burkholderiacea, Pseudomonadaceae andCandidatus species (Supplementary Fig. 1). A search for similar occurrences of the DSST structural motif in other PDB structures using the ASSAM computer program revealed a match to a member of the Ski-like DNA binding domain superfamily (PDB ID: 3EQ5). However, a similar search using the DSST-DSST arrangement from each protomer did not retrieve any similarly arranged motif to be present in the currently available PDB structures.\nIn the EfaCas1\u20132/prespacer complex (PDB ID: 5XVN), the D11BPSL1038 equivalent residue (D13) and S43Efa_Cas2 are associated with Mg2+ ions that interact with the minor groove of the prespacer DNA backbone (Fig. 4b)20, a similar observation was also found in the PAM prespacer bound Cas4/Cas1/Cas2 complex of Geobacter sulfurreducens (PDB:7MI4) with the equivalent D11BPSL1038 residue (D10) and S34Gsu_Cas2 associated Mn2+ ions24. Nonetheless, the crystal structure of rBPSL1038 soaked with manganese ions was found to be almost identical (RMSD of 0.165 \u00c5) to the rBPSL1038 that was previously solved, in which a water molecule positioned in the active site was not to be substituted by a manganese ion. This is evident when a manganese atom was modelled into the manganese chloride soaked rBPSL1038 crystal structure; the refined structure shows that the Mn atom has a temperature factor (B-factor) value of 49. In contrast, the surrounding atoms only have a B-factor of\nCOMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | (2023) 6:920 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-023-05265-4 | www.nature.com/commsbio 5\n~10\u201320. In addition, negative density was found in the Fo-Fc difference map of the manganese ion. Nonetheless, when a water molecule was fitted to the density, the water molecule was refined with a B-factor of 13.2, similar to the B-factor of the surrounding atoms. These results indicate that the manganese atom did not replace the water molecule in the active site of BPSL1038 (Supplementary Fig. 5).\nFurther structure analysis revealed that the rather flat and wide potential substrate-binding surface of BPSL1038 provides a suitable platform for dsDNA binding. The BPSL1038 dimer has an overall negatively charged surface that differs from other Cas2 examples (Supplementary Fig. 6). The side chains of four BPSL1038 solvent-exposed positively charged amino acids (R10, R30, R54 and K57) from each subunit are systematically oriented on the potential substrate binding surface, with the negatively charged cage formed by the D11SST motif located in the middle (Fig. 5). The structural arrangement of these four positively charged amino acids point to the possibility that they may have a direct role in nucleic acid binding. Using these positions as a reference point for a nucleic acid binding interface, we constructed a model that demonstrates how the putative active site of BPSL1038 is able to fit the minor groove space in doublestranded DNA spanning ~12 \u00c5 (see section on endonuclease activity). Superpositions of BPSL1038 with the E. coli Cas1-Cas2 complex bound to protospacer DNA substrates (PDB ID: 5DS5)25 indicates that the R10 and R30 residues of the BPSL1038 dimer may function as a pair of arginine clamps to interact with the phosphate backbone of the DNA substrate, similar to the R78 and R16 residues in Eco_Cas2. However, rotameric conformational changes of BPSL1038 R10 and R30 in the current coordination would be needed for such an interaction to occur (Fig. 5).\nEndonuclease activity of rBPSL1038. Due to the Cas2 similarities, we next investigated the nuclease activity of rBPSL1038 using pUC19 plasmid as substrate. The purified rBPSL1038 cleaved the plasmid in a time-based sequential degradation mode (Fig. 6a, Supplementary Fig. 7a). The supercoiled pUC19 plasmid\nwas gradually nicked to a relaxed circular form, and eventually into a linearized form. These observations suggest that BPSL1038 can function as a dsDNA endonuclease; nonetheless, the detailed mechanism of the supercoiled DNA nicking has yet to be elucidated. We further observed that the endonuclease activity was significantly reduced when the reaction buffer contained 100 mM or more NaCl or KCl (Fig. 6b, Supplementary Fig. 7b). This suggests that the concentration of monovalent ions in the reaction buffer may act as a determining factor for nuclease activity, or the increased salt concentration may weaken nucleic acid binding, subsequently affecting nuclease activity.\nThe nuclease activity of rBPSL1038 for dsDNA was optimum at pH 6 (Fig. 6c, Supplementary Fig. 7c), suggesting pHdependent activity. This differs from the previously reported Cas2 which are Xal_Cas226, Bha_Cas210 and Spy_Cas217 where nuclease activity was either inactivated or significantly decreased at acidic pH. To further analyze if BPSL1038 is a divalent-cationdependent nuclease, the dsDNA cleavage activity of rBPSL1038 with (Ca2+, Mg2+ and Mn2+) and without divalent cations as well as chelating agent (EDTA) were tested. Interestingly, rBPSL1038 cleaved dsDNA in the absence of divalent ions or in the presence of Mg2+, Mn2+, Ca2+ or EDTA (Fig. 6d, Supplementary Fig. 7d), suggesting that rBPSL1038 may act as a divalent-ion-independent nuclease.\nIn order to propose a basic mechanism of how BPSL1038 is able to cleave dsDNA via a metal-independent reaction, we further explored the geometry of the potential functional site involved in nucleic acid binding and cleavage. Although the structure comparisons with other Cas2 proteins have provided substantial structural similarity to support the metal iondependent nuclease hypothesis (Fig. 5d), further structural analysis revealed that two scissile phosphates (n, n\u2019) of the minor groove, located 12.5 \u00c5 apart, are in position to be at the two potential active sites consisting of D11A, S33A, R30B and D11B, S33B, R30A, respectively with distances in the range of ~2.6\u20134.5 \u00c5, while residue R10 is likely to interact with phosphate group of nucleotide n+ 1, n\u2019+1 (Fig. 7).\n6 COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | (2023) 6:920 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-023-05265-4 | www.nature.com/commsbio\nrBPSL1038 conformation in various salt concentrations. The calculated molecular weight of rBPSL1038 fused with a 6x-His tag is 12.1 kDa. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) demonstrated that the molecular weight in a solution containing 100 mM NaCl was ~28 kDa, indicating that rBPSL1038 could be a dimer. Nonetheless, increasing the NaCl concentration in the SEC elution buffer significantly increased the rBPSL1038 retention volume (Fig. 8a), proposing that rBPSL1038 may undergo conformational changes in the presence of different NaCl concentrations. rBPSL1038 appeared as a monomeric protein (~11.4 kDa) in buffer containing 250 mM NaCl and shifted to a dimeric (~28 kDa) and oligomeric conformations (~32, ~35 and ~52 kDa) in the presence of 100, 50, 25 and 0 mM NaCl, respectively (Fig. 8a). To investigate the NaCl concentrationrelated retention volume shift of the SEC profile, the SEC-purified rBPSL1038 from various salt concentrations (100, 50, 25 and 0 mM) was subjected to DLS analysis. The results show a consistent diameter with an average of 5.6 nm (range of 4.8\u20136.5 nm) in all tested NaCl concentrations (Fig. 8b), indicating that the size of the rBPSL1038 (~27\u201337 kDa) remains similar in various salt concentrations, suggesting that the observation of NaCl concentration-related SEC profiles could be an artefact.\nBPSL1038 is non-toxic to nematodes. The genes in the CRISPRCas systems were found to encode numerous nucleases that are homologue to prokaryotic toxins27. One of these predicted toxins is the Cas2 protein, which may play a role in programmed cell\ndeath in the anti-phage defence system or when bacteria respond to environmental stresses13,27. The potential toxic effect of BPSL1038 on its host during infection was evaluated using a transgenic C. elegans ugt-29::gfp detoxification biosensor28 which is based on activation of the UDP-glucoronosyl transferase (UGT) detoxification mechanism in the presence of toxins and xenobiotics. The transgenic worms were fed with E. coli bearing the rBPSL1038 construct under IPTG-induced conditions up to 48 h or treated with crude rBPSL1038 protein for up to 96 h and fluorescence was monitored.\nWorms that were fed with E. coli carrying the recombinant clone in the absence or presence of IPTG only showed mild fluorescence even after 48 h (Fig. 9a). Meanwhile, fluorescence was observed for worms treated with 1 mg rBPSL1038 protein although the intensity was not significantly higher when compared to control worms exposed to E. coli secreted proteins. Sporadic areas of fluorescence at 96 h (Fig. 9b) suggested a toxinlike property that mildly activated the detoxification system. However, the fluorescence was not as intense as that seen for worms treated with the wild-type B. pseudomallei secretome which is known to contain toxic molecules such as bactobolin28. We then performed a nematode survival assay where wild type C. elegans were fed with E. coli bearing the rBPSL1038 construct grown on NGM\u00b1 IPTG and the result showed no significant difference in mean-time-to-death (p > 0.0001) between worms fed on induced and uninduced recombinant clone (Fig. 9c, Supplementary Data 1). Collectively, the data ruled out the possibility that BPSL1038 is a toxin.\nBPSL1038 share similar coordination with the \u2018arginine clamp\u2019 that may also interact with the DNA substrate. b The Eco_Cas2-DNA complex (PDB ID: 5DS5) is shown in the same orientation as BPSL1038-DNA model (for better comparison, Eco_Cas2 was coloured in green and cyan same as BPSL1038).

The D11 and SST active site of BPSL1038 is located between the \u2018arginine clamp\u2019 pair, which may accommodate one or two catalytic Mg2+ to cleave the DNA backbone before the arginine clamped nucleotide (circled) located close to the D11 aspartate pair (left). The 2Fo-Fc maps for the active site are contoured at 1.5\u03c3. d Schematic presentation of the proposed DNA cleavage mechanism in which the aspartate pair coordinate with a metal cation (Mg2+) to activate a nucleophilic water which coordinated with the cation. The activated hydroxyl group of the water molecule will initiate an attack to the scissile phosphate.

The Mg2+ ion may also coordinate with residue S33.\nCOMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | (2023) 6:920 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-023-05265-4 | www.nature.com/commsbio 7\nLimited Cytotoxicity of rBPSL1038 against MCF7 human breast carcinoma cell. To confirm the above findings that BPSL1038 is not toxic, the MTT assay (n= 9) was performed on human breast cancer MCF7 cells treated with rBPSL1038. The assay demonstrated that BPSL1038 displayed limited cytotoxicity towards the MCF7 cells. The IC20 (20% inhibition) of MCF7 cell growth following 72 h of BPSL1038 treatment was 305 \u00b1 10.80 \u00b5g/ mL. Only 30% of cell growth was inhibited at concentrations up to 800 \u00b5g/mL (Supplementary Fig. 8 and Supplementary Table 1).

This lends credence to the possibility that BPSL1038 is a member of a yet uncharacterized protein family/subfamily within the superfamily of Cas2 proteins. The discovery that BPSL1038 had structural similarities to Cas2 homologs (Supplementary Fig. 4) that were not detectable at the sequence level led to further routes of investigations to characterize the function of BPSL1038.\nSubstantial divergence was observed at \u03b11, loop \u03b21-\u03b11, loop \u03b12\u03b24, \u03b24 and the C-terminal regions of BPSL1038 compared to Cas2 and Hpy_VapD proteins. The \u03b11 of BPSL1038 is sandwiched between two 310-helices, an arrangement that is not seen in all examples of Cas2 and Hyp_VapD. The coordinate of 310-helix \u03b13101 of BPSL1038 was located at the region equivalent to loop \u03b21\u03b11 in Cas2 proteins. A long \u03b21-\u03b11 loop was proposed as the DNA binding feature for the Bha_Cas2, Spy_Cas2 and Xal_Cas2 proteins10\u201312. However, BPSL1038 has a rather short turn connecting the \u03b21 and \u03b11 through \u03b1-3101 (Fig. 3a). Furthermore, BPSL1038 also lacks the long \u03b12-\u03b24 loop that was suggested as a signature feature for Cas2 proteins to grip ssRNA as seen in Sso_Cas213; the equivalent region in the Hpy_VapD protein consists of an additional helix. Both Sso_Cas2 and Hpy_VapD are known endoribonucleases (Fig. 3b, d). Interestingly, Tth_Cas2 was found to have both \u03b21-\u03b11 and \u03b12-\u03b24 loop regions with similar dimensions as BPSL1038 (Fig. 3c). Tth_Cas2 was reported to possess dual nuclease activity towards dsDNA and ssRNA substrates but with a preference for the former10. This observation indicates that it may be possible that BPSL1038 functions as a nuclease like Tth_Cas2. Nonetheless, the electrostatic surface of BPSL1038 is vastly different from that of Tth_Cas2 (Supplementary Fig. 6) in keeping with the low sequence identity (11%) (Fig. 2a) which suggests that the substrate binding mechanisms for these proteins are different or that they have conserved nuclease functions but also have different components involved in very different cellular roles.\nDespite the generally low sequence identity between BPSL1038 and the Cas2 homologs, multiple sequence alignment shows that the catalytically important aspartate residues in Cas2 and Hpy_VapD are indeed conserved in BPSL1038 and identified as residue D11. The coordination of residue D11 to form an aspartate pair that is similar to those in the Cas2 and Hpy_VapD proteins (Fig. 3) suggests a similar functionality. The D11 pair in BPSL1038 is 5.9 \u00c5 apart, and thus much closer compared to those identified in the Cas2 proteins that are in the range of 6.5\u201315 \u00c5 apart10,12. This makes it possible for BPSL1038 to coordinate with divalent metal ions such as Mg2+ that are important for Cas2 nuclease activity. Interestingly, D11 pairs together with residues S33 and T34 to constitute a negatively charged cage that coordinating a water molecule (w1) (Fig. 4). The distances of the two aspartate side chains are 3.2 and 3.6 \u00c5 from w1, indicating that with a minor conformational change, the aspartate pair may be able to coordinate with a divalent ion like Mg2+. Hence, it is likely that both aspartate residues may coordinate with a metal cation (Mg2+) to activate a nucleophilic water molecule, similar to the proposed mechanism of Sso_Cas213. The activated hydroxyl group of the water molecule will then initiate a nucleophilic attack on the scissile phosphate. The negatively charged penta-coordinated transition state is possibly stabilized by the metal ion or the side chain of R30. The close proximity of the side chain hydroxyl group of S33 to the aspartate pair at 2.5 to 4.1 \u00c5, respectively, makes the interaction with the Mg2+ ion possible (Fig. 5d) to likely forms an octahedral coordination. Nonetheless, the nuclease assay results indicate that rBPSL1038 is likely using a divalent-ion independent cleavage mechanism because the use of EDTA to chelate free metal ions was found to not have an effect on dsDNA cleavage activity (Fig. 6d). It is also\npossible that the hydroxyl group on the S33 side chain can initiate the nucleophilic attack to the phosphodiester bond, while the residues R30 can stabilize the penta-covalent intermediate (Fig. 7) similar to the metal ion independent Ser recombinases29\u201331 previously reported. This suggests that BPSL1038 is unique as most Cas2 proteins have been classified as metallonucleases11\u201313,15,32. The divalention-independent catalytic mechanism towards cleavage of RNA was previous reported for VapD16 and Lin_Cas215, however, divalent ion-independent DNAse activity has not been described for Cas2 proteins. While divalent metal-independent RNA catalysis is possible as the 2\u2019-hydroxyl group of ribose can serve as an intrinsic nucleophile15, the divalent ion-independent DNase activity requires further investigation.\nFurther structural analysis revealed that the D11 equivalent residue in Efa_Cas1-2/prespacer complex (PDB ID: 5XVN)20 together with S43Efa_Cas2 (T34 in BPSL1038) residues that interact with Mg2+ are in contact with the prespacer DNA backbone (Fig. 4b). These observations suggest that the D11 and SST33\u201335 sequence may serve as a signature motif unique to members belonging to this BPSL1038 family. This is further supported by the conservation of this motif throughout the 85 species with homologs from seven genera identified from the NCBI protein databank and Burkholderia genome databases (https://www.burkholderia.com/orthologs/list?id=371057) (Supplementary Fig. 1).\nStructural superposition of BPSL1038 with the E. coli Cas1Cas2-protospacer DNA25 and Efa_Cas1-2/prespacer complexes20 further revealed that dsDNA may interact with the potential D11 (X20)SST active site of BPSL1038 (Figs. 4b, 5). Moreover, the arginine clamp residues (R16 and R78) of Eco_Cas2 in the E. coli Cas1-Cas2 complex that grasp the protospacer DNA was shown to share a similar coordination with R10 and R30 of BPSL1038; suggesting that BPSL1038 may interact with the substrate DNA backbone in a similar manner (Fig. 5). Hence, we have modelled the dsDNA (matrix shown in Supplementary Table 2) onto the BPSL1038 structure using Eco_Cas2 as a reference (Fig. 5b). By changing the side chain rotamer of R10 and R30 with the guanidinium groups pointing towards the modelled DNA phosphate backbone, the arginine pairs may clamp the phosphate group of nucleotides (n3\u2019 and n9), separated by a half turn of DNA helix across the minor groove. As a result, we hypothesize that the dsDNA is exposed to the putative active site of BPSL1038 without obvious steric clashes and the proposed active site with electronegative environment will catalyze cleavage at the nucleotides position (n4 and n8\u2019), one position before the arginine interacting site that shows closest proximity to the D11 aspartate pair (Fig. 5b, c).\nMutation of the D11 equivalent aspartate residue in Sso_Cas2, Hpy_VapD and Lin_Cas2 have been reported as important for catalytic activity13,15,16. Previously, mutated residues Q33, Y34 and S35 of Sso_Cas2 with coordinates equivalent to the SST motif were also shown to slightly reduce RNAse activity. This suggests that a mutation of the highly conserved S32 residue of BPSL1038 may disrupt the structure of ST-turn that consists of residues S33 and T34 and prevent the formation of the active site (Fig. 4). It is worth noting that the SST motif that assembled the ST-turn was not found in either Sso_Cas2 or other Cas2 proteins (Fig. 2a). Taken together, BPSL1038 may have evolved to assemble a unique catalytic site compared to other known Cas2 and VapD homologs. The R10 and R30 residues that is proposed also function as a pair of arginine clamps similar to that of Eco_Cas236. Although the DSST motif on its own can be associated with a known DNA binding domain (PDB ID: 3EQ5), the combined arrangement of DSST(DSST-DSST) in both protomers is a novel arrangement that has only been detected in this\n10 COMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | (2023) 6:920 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-023-05265-4 | www.nature.com/commsbio\nstructure and we believe it to also be structurally conserved in members of Burkholderiacea in which the sequence motif is present.\nThe nuclease activity assays clearly demonstrate that BPSL1038 is an endonuclease capable of cleaving dsDNA (Fig. 6a). The cleavage of dsDNA is consistent with the studies reported for Spy_Cas2, Bha_Cas2 and Xal_Cas210\u201312, Nonetheless, unlike the activities of all these known Cas2 dsDNA-targetting DNases that are divalent metal ion dependent, the activity of BPSL1038 was shown to be divalent ion independent (Fig. 6d). In Cas2 proteins, a divalent-ions-independent catalytic mechanism on RNA was previously reported for VapD16 and Lin_Cas215, but not for divalent ion independent DNAse activity. While divalent metalindependent RNA catalysis is possible as the 2\u2019-hydroxyl group of ribose can serve as an intrinsic nucleophile15, we modelled a hypothetical interaction of how the active site and associated arginine clamp residues (R10 and R30) may be able to interact with a target DNA and fit into the minor groove to allow for the catalysis reaction to occur (Fig. 7). This model is able to propose a mechanism of how the DNase activity is carried out in a divalent ion independent manner.\nUnlike Hpy_VapD nuclease activity that is not influenced by monovalent ions (Na+ and K+), Bha_Cas2 and Lin_Cas2 were more active in the presence of high monovalent K+ and Na+ concentrations (50\u2013200 mM) with K+ being a better metal than Na+10,15,16. An opposite monovalent cation effect was observed for rBPSL1038 where NaCl and KCl concentrations of >100 mM significantly inhibited the dsDNase activity (Fig. 6b). This points to the existence of a diverse metal ion regulatory system for dsDNase that shares a similar dimeric ferredoxin fold. Nonetheless, the exact mechanism of how the monovalent cation participates in nuclease activity is currently unknown.\nIn CRISPR-Cas systems, Cas2 is known to provide a scaffolding role by binding to the new spacer DNA while Cas1 acts as the nuclease during the spacer acquisition process. As a result, the biological function of nuclease activity for Cas2 proteins remains an unresolved question. Gunderson and co-workers revealed that Lpn_Cas2 nuclease activity was associated with bacterial virulence during host infection33, similarly, the VapD protein homolog is also known as a virulence-associated protein16. In B. pseudomallei, neither a CRISPR-Cas2 system nor a Cas1 gene homolog has been detected34. Hence, the revelation that BPSL1038 shares a similar structure and function to Cas2 associated proteins raises two hypotheses: (i) B. pseudomallei may contain other Cas genes with significantly diverged sequences that have made them undetectable by sequence similarity searches or (ii) BPSL1038 may be a virulence associated protein or toxin similar to Lin_Cas2 and VapD protein. Nonetheless, the first hypothesis may not be fully applicable as no CRISPR elements have been found in B. pseudomallei34. To address the possibility that BPSL1038 may exert a toxic effect on its host, we assessed the potency of the rBPSL1038 protein on C. elegans and the ability of this protein to induce the nematode detoxification system. The data indicates that BPSL1038 is most likely not a virulenceassociated protein. In addition, rBPSL1038 also showed limited cytotoxicity against the human breast cancer MCF7 cell line, suggesting that BPSL1038 may not be a cytotoxic protein. Nonetheless, in the CRISPR-Cas original study, Cas2 was hypothesized to be derived from the VapD Toxin-antitoxin (TA) system27,35.\nIn conclusion, structural similarity of BPSL1038 points towards it sharing a common ancestor with Cas2 and VapD proteins. Our results show that despite structural similarity to Cas2 and VapD, only the putative arginine clamps stand out in a generally negatively charged surface that are a stark contrast to the surface of Cas2 and VapD. Furthermore, although there is substructural\nsimilarity of the DSST motif to a Ski-like DNA binding domain, the extended functional site DSST-DSST arrangement in the dimeric form is unique. The evidence thus far suggests that BPSL1038 represents a sub-family of nucleases with metal independent capacity and a yet to be determined role in the physiology of the bacterial species that produce it."

            "text": "Protein expression and purification. The recombinant BPSL1038-selenomethionine substituted protein (smBPSL1038) was expressed, purified, and crystallized as previously reported7 except that the E. coli strain (B834) was cultured in minimal media. Briefly, bacterial cells from 20mL overnight cultures grown in Luria Bertani (LB) media were harvested at 1664g, 4 \u00b0C for 15 mins. Excess LB was removed by resuspending the pellet in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer followed by centrifugation at 1664g, 4 \u00b0C for 15 mins. The cell pellet was then resuspended with minimal media containing selenomethionine before inoculation into 1 L selenomethionine media and grown at 37 \u00b0C until OD600= 0.5\u20130.8. The culture was then moved to 16 \u00b0C and induced with 1 mM isopropyl-\u03b2-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) overnight. For functional analysis, N-terminus 6X-His tagged recombinant native BPSL1038 protein (rBPSL1038) was purified via a three-step purification method using (1st) Ni-NTA affinity, (2nd) anion exchange and (3rd) size exclusion chromatography. In brief, two grams of overexpressed cell pellet was resuspended with 20 ml of Buffer A (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 M NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 2 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol) and lysed by sonication7. The lysate was centrifuged, and the supernatant was loaded onto a Ni-NTA affinity column (5 ml Histrap\u2122 HP, Cytiva) pre-equilibrated with Buffer A. Unbound proteins were then washed off with 50 ml Buffer A, followed by 50 ml Buffer B (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 20 mM imidazole, 2 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol). The bound proteins were eluted with a linear gradient of 100 ml Buffer C (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 500 mM imidazole, 2 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol). The eluate fractions containing rBPSL1038 were pooled, diluted with Buffer B to a final concentration of ~100 mM imidazole and supplemented with 1 mM EDTA. The diluted fractions were further purified with an anion exchange column (1 ml HiTrap\u00ae Q XL, Cytiva) pre-equilibrated in Buffer D (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 100 mM NaCl, 100 mM imidazole, 2 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM EDTA) and eluted with a linear gradient of 20 ml Buffer E (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1.1 M NaCl, 100 mM imidazole, 2 mM \u03b2- mercaptoethanol, 1 mM EDTA). Subsequently, 1.5 ml of the eluate containing rBPSL1038 was further purified with a size exclusion column (HiPrep\u2122 16/60 Sephacryl\u00ae S-200 HR, Cytiva) pre-equlibrated with Buffer F (25 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 25 mM NaCl) (Supplementary Fig. 9). Eluates containing rBPSL1038 were collected for functional analysis. In addition, purified rBPSL1038 protein was subjected to Mass Spectrometry analysis using the Q Exactive Plus Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap mass spectrometer system (Thermo Scientific, MA, USA) for purity verification (Supplementary Fig. 9).\nAnalysis of N-terminus His-tag cleavage rBPSL1038. The rBPSL1038 (0.44 mg) was treated with 4.4U of thrombin (10 unit/ mg of protein) and incubated at 4 \u00b0C for 20 h. The sample was loaded onto the HisTrap HP 5ml column (Cytiva, USA). Fractions of flowthrough that contained the N-terminus His-tag cleaved rBPSL1038 (rBPSL1038-post-cleavage) were collected. The rBPSL1038-post-cleavage sample was then subjected to size exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis using the HiLoad 16/ 600 Superdex 75 pg column (Cytiva, USA) pre-equilibrated in 25 mM Tris\u2013HCl (pH 7.5) and 100 mM NaCl. The SEC retention\nCOMMUNICATIONS BIOLOGY | (2023) 6:920 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s42003-023-05265-4 | www.nature.com/commsbio 11\nvolume of the rBPSL1038-post-cleavage and the rBPSL1038 that contained the His-tag fusion were compared.\nAnalysis of rBPSL1038 molecular size. SEC using a HiLoad 16/ 600 Superdex 75 pg column (Cytiva, USA)7 was repeated by adjusting the NaCl concentrations range from 0mM to 250 mM. The retention volume profile from each SEC was compared, and relative molecular weights were calculated. The SEC-purified rBPSL1038 was subjected to Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) analysis using the Zetasizer Nano Series (Malvern Panalytical, UK) to analyze the diameter of the BPSL1038 samples.\nProtein crystallization. SeMet-BPSL1038 (smBPSL1038) protein crystals were obtained using the reservoir solution consisting of 0.1 M sodium acetate (pH 4.6), 2 M sodium formate with 10 mgml\u22121 protein in buffer containing 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 100 mM NaCl and 20 mM \u03b2-mercaptoethanol. Conditions were further optimized using the hanging-drop vapour-diffusion method in 24-well trays with drops made up of equal volumes of protein solution and precipitant (1:1 \u03bcl) and equilibrated against 1 ml reservoir solution at 293 K as previously reported7. The capacity of BPSL1038\u2019s active site to bind divalent ions was investigated by soaking the BPSL1038 native crystal in cryoprotectant solution7 that contained an additional 25 mM MnCl2 for 3 h.\nCrystal structure determination and refinement. Diffraction data was collected for smBPSL1038 using the single anomalous dispersion (SAD) method using beamline I03 at the Diamond Light Source, UK at a wavelength of 0.97972 \u00c5 with oscillation of 0.20\u00b0 and total oscillation of 180\u00b0. Diffraction data were processed in XDS37. The space group was further determined using Pointless38 and data were merged using Aimless39. The selenium sites were identified using HySS in the Phenix package14,40 which identified seven Se atom sites. The substructures were fed into the Phaser SAD pipeline41,42 for experimental phasing followed by Parrot for density modification43 and Buccaneer for automated model building44. An initial map with protein/solvent boundaries and secondary structure features resolved was obtained. The initial model was refined using REFMAC45,46 and subjected to automated model building using ARP/wARP47. ARP/wARP models allowed the tracing of 97 residues in one chain and 81 residues in the other chain, indicating the presence of two molecules in the asymmetric unit. Model rebuilding was carried out with COOT48 and refinement with REFMAC45,46. The refined smBPSL1038 model was used as a search model for molecular replacement using MOLREP36 to determine the native structure of rBPSL1038 from the X-ray diffraction dataset (1.55 \u00c5 resolution) collected at beamline I02 also at Diamond at a wavelength of 0.9795 \u00c57. The final models of both smBPSL1038 and rBPSL1038 contain residues from His-13 to Gly-87 in molecule A and Ala-2 to Gly-87 in molecule B with all residues falling in the favoured and allowed regions of the Ramachandran plot, as defined in PROCHECK49. The rBPSL1038 structure with the higher resolution was used for further analysis throughout this study. The coordinates and structure factors for both SeMetBPSL1038 and native structure have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) with the PDB codes 7VXT and 7VXR, respectively. For the MnCl2-soaked rBPSL1038 crystal, diffraction data was collected (2.05 \u00c5 resolution) using the in-house Rigaku MicroMax-007 HF X-ray diffractometer (Rigaku, Tokyo, Japan). The structure was determined using molecular replacement with the rBPSL1038 as the search model. The structure was refined to Rwork/Rfree of 0.2175/0.2575 (Supplementary Data 2\u20133). The\ndata collection and refinement statistics are summarized in Table 1.\nSequence and structure analysis of BPSL1038 hypothetical protein. To investigate the similarity between BPSL1038 and Cas2 proteins, detailed sequence, and structure analysis of BPSL1038 in comparison with CRISPR-associated Cas2 proteins and VapD protein were conducted. Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) was carried out using T-coffee (Expresso)50 which is able to incorporate protein structural information for the MSA51. The secondary structures were displayed together with MSA incorporated using ESPript 3.050. Structure comparison of BPSL1038 against other protein structures in the PDB was conducted using DALI8,9. Protein Interfaces Surfaces and Assemblies (PISA)52 was used to analyze the protein structure interface and assembly. The image of the structure was generated using PyMol53 while electrostatic potential surface was generated using CCP4MG54. The BPSL1038, CRISPR-Cas2 associated and VapD proteins used in the sequence and structure analysis and comparison were labelled and listed throughout the manuscript as shown in Supplementary\nTable 3. Substructure similarity searching was carried out using the latest version of the ASSAM computer program accessed as a web application55,56.\nNuclease activity assay. The circular plasmid pUC19 was used as a substrate for the nuclease assay. The plasmid was isolated from E. coli JM109 using the Primeway Plasmid DNA Extraction Kit (1st Base, Malaysia). pUC19 was eluted and stored in deionized water at \u201320 \u00b0C. All nuclease activities were carried out using 10 \u00b5M of rBPSL1038 incubated with 10 nM of pUC19 in reaction buffer containing 50 mM MES monohydrate (pH 6), 50 mM NaCl and 2.5 mM MgCl2. The assays were performed at 37 \u00b0C for 5 h. The optimum reaction conditions for the DNase activity assay were determined by optimizing several parameters (pH, divalent ions, and salt concentration). The reaction was incubated over the course of 1 to 16 h. The optimal salt type and concentration for rBPSL1038 were determined using either NaCl or KCl at a series of concentrations from 5mM to 200mM. In the pH dependence assay, MES monohydrate was substituted with 50 mM of either sodium acetate (pH 4\u20135), Tris-HCl (pH 7\u20139) or glycine-NaOH (pH 10). Metal dependence assay was also done by replacing MgCl2 with either 2.5 mM of CaCl2, MnCl2 or chelating agent EDTA. The end reaction products were electrophoresed in 1% agarose gel for 60 mins at 110 V. The gels were stained with 1 \u00b5g/ml ethidium bromide for 30 min and de-stained in water for 5 min to enable visualization."

One hundred mL of a 25-fold \u2013concentration liquid overnight culture was spotted onto NGM plates supplemented with 1 mM IPTG and incubated at room temperature for 24 h. Gravid worms were laid on cdc-25.1 RNAi plates for 4 h and then transferred to similar plates for an additional 4 h of egg laying. Eggs were left to hatch and grow in the presence of cdc-25.1 RNAi to produce sterile germ line proliferation-deficient (Glp) worms.\nApproximately 40 transgenic worms were transferred to NGM plates pre-seeded with the rBPSL1038 induced or uninduced clones in the presence or absence of IPTG, respectively, and maintained at 25 \u00b0C throughout the assay for observation at 24 and 48 h. In a parallel experiment, 40 sterile transgenic worms were transferred to NGM plates infused with 1 mg crude rBPSL1038 protein for 24 and 96 h prior to GFP visualization. Worms on NGM infused with wild type B. pseudomallei or spread with E. coli OP50 bacteria served as controls. At the end of the assay, 10 transgenic worms were mounted on a 2% agarose pad placed on a glass slide for GFP examination. Worms were paralysed with 5 mM levamisole and observed under 100 \u00d7 and 400 \u00d7 magnifications with a Leica I3 long pass GFP filter (Leica Microsystems) on a Leica upright fluorescence microscope. All images were captured using the Leica DCF 310 FX digital colour camera and LAS version 3.8 software (Leica Microsystems).\nCaenorhabditis elegans survival assay. C. elegans rrf3(pk1426);glp-4(bn2) worms were synchronized and grown on NGM at 25oC to adult stage. For infection assays, thirty agematched worms were transferred to NGM supplemented with or without IPTG plates pre-seeded with E. coli strain BL21-Rosetta gami (DE3) carrying the pET-28b-BPSL1038 construct. Survival of worms was monitored until all the worms died (failed to respond to probing with a platinum wire picker).\nCytotoxicity test for rBPSL1038 against MCF7 human breast carcinoma. The rBPSL1038 was tested using the MTT (3-[4,5- dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5 diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) assay to observe MCF7 cell line (HTB-22\u2122, ATCC, Virginia, United States) viability. MCF7 cells (5000 cells per well) were seeded into a 96-well plate on Day 1. After 24 hr, the cells were treated with BPSL1038 and incubated for 72 hr in a CO2 incubator. Then, 20 \u03bcl of 5 mg/ml MTT reagent (Sigma Aldrich, USA) was added into each well and the plate was incubated at 37\u02daC for 3 hr. After incubation, the MTT reagent was removed and 200 \u00b5l of Dimethyl Sulfoxide (DMSO, 5%) was added to each well. The 96-well plate was placed on an orbital shaker for 15 min. Absorbance was read at 570 nm (SpectraMax\u00ae ABS Plus, Molecular Devices, California, USA).\nStatistics and reproducibility. All the nuclease activity assay were conducted in duplicate, except the metal dependence assay (Fig. 6d) were conducted triplicate.\nThe C. elegans survival assay experiment was performed in triplicate. The analyses of C. elegans survival assay was performed using StatView version 5.0.1. P-value of < 0.0001 was considered as statistically significant.\nTo investigate the cytotoxicity of rBPSL1038 against MCF7 human breast carcinoma, the MTT assay was performed. Nine replicates were performed for each concentration of rBPSL1038 treatment, each with their respective control. Concentrations were as follows: 800, 400, 200, 100, 50, 25, 12.5, 6.25, 3.13, 1.56, 0.78, and 0.39 \u00b5g/ml. The cell viability (%) was calculated relative to untreated cells, and IC20 was determined using Microsoft\u00ae Excel. IC20 is presented as mean \u00b1 SD. For data visualization,\ngraph was plotted using GraphPad Prism\u00ae (version 6.01).
