1. **Investigate the effect of different anion structures on the CO2 absorption capacity of APILs.** This could be done by synthesizing APILs with different anion chain lengths, branching, and functional groups.
2. **Study the recyclability of APILs for CO2 absorption over multiple cycles.** This would involve investigating the effect of repeated CO2 absorption and desorption cycles on the APILs' CO2 absorption capacity and stability.
3. **Explore the use of APILs for CO2 capture from flue gas.** This would involve studying the performance of APILs in capturing CO2 from simulated flue gas streams, and investigating the effects of impurities and other gases present in flue gas on the APILs' CO2 absorption capacity.
4. **Develop a theoretical model to predict the CO2 absorption capacity of APILs.** This model could be used to screen different APILs for CO2 absorption applications and to optimize the design of APILs with high CO2 absorption capacities.
5. **Investigate the use of APILs for CO2 separation from natural gas.** This would involve studying the performance of APILs in separating CO2 from natural gas, and investigating the effects of impurities and other gases present in natural gas on the APILs' CO2 separation performance.
