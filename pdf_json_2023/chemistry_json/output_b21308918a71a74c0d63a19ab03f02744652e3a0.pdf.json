In this study, we propose a new two-module assembly model for the KATP 25 channel. Our mutagenesis experiments, based on this model, indicate that deleting ECL3 on the 26 SUR1 subunit impairs KNtp-independent Mg-ADP activation. This finding demonstrates the 27 essential role of intramolecular interactions between KATPcore and SURABC in Mg-ADP 28 activation. Notably, this interface is functionally conserved between SUR1 and SUR2. 29 Additionally, the hydrophobic residue F351 on ECL3 of SUR1 is crucial for maintaining the 30 stability of this interface. 31",

Their potassium currents are 33 inhibited by intracellular ATP and activated by intracellular Mg-ADP. Therefore, they tune the 34 membrane potential of the cell according to the intracellular ATP/ADP ratio (Nichols, 2006). 35 KATP channels are distributed in many tissues, such as pancreatic cells, the brain, and muscles, 36 and are involved in a series of physiological processes (Ashcroft, 2006; Flagg et al., 2010). The 37 genetic mutations of KATP channels can lead to various human diseases, including dilated 38 cardiomyopathy (Bienengraeber et al., 2004), Cantu syndrome (Harakalova et al., 2012; van Bon 39 et al., 2012), familial atrial fibrillation (Olson et al., 2007), intellectual disability myopathy 40 syndrome (Smeland et al., 2019), neonatal diabetes mellitus (Pipatpolkai et al., 2020), and 41\nhyperinsulinaemic hypoglycemia of infancy (Pipatpolkai et al., 2020). KATP channel inhibitors 42 (insulin secretagogues) are widely used to treat diabetes. KATP activators (KATP openers) are 43 used for the treatment of hypoglycemia, hypertension, and hair loss (Wu et al., 2022). 44\nKATP channels are hetero-octamers formed by Kir6 (Kir6.1 or Kir6.2) and SUR (SUR1, SUR2A, 45 or SUR2B) subunits in a 4:4 ratio. Four Kir6 subunits form the central channel pore, and four 46 regulatory SUR subunits are located peripherally (Wu et al., 2022). Recent cryo-EM studies have 47 provided high-resolution views of the pancreatic KATP channel (Kir6.2+SUR1) in multiple 48 states (Ding et al., 2019; Lee et al., 2017; Li et al., 2017; Martin et al., 2017a; Martin et al., 2019; 49 Martin et al., 2017b; Wang et al., 2022a; Wang et al., 2022b; Wu et al., 2018; Zhao and 50 MacKinnon, 2021). These structures show that in the inhibited condition, when insulin 51 secretagogues and ATP are present, the ATP binds in a pocket of Kir6.2, and the ABLOS motif 52 on SUR1 interacts with the phosphate group of ATP (Ding et al., 2019). The Kir6 N-terminal 53 peptide (KNtp) binds in the center of SUR1, which is close to the insulin secretagogue binding 54 site (Ding et al., 2019; Martin et al., 2019; Wu et al., 2018). In the activated condition, when Mg-55 ADP is present, Mg-ADP binds in the consensus site of NBD2 of SUR1 to drive the asymmetric 56 dimerization of the ABC-transporter module (Lee et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2022b; Wu et al., 57 2018; Zhao and MacKinnon, 2021) and to release the KNtp from SUR1 (Wang et al., 2022b; Wu 58 et al., 2018; Zhao and MacKinnon, 2021). The unbinding of ATP from Kir6.2 is associated with 59 the rotation of Kir6.2 CTD, leading to channel opening (Wang et al., 2022b; Zhao and 60 MacKinnon, 2021). Despite the progress made, there is still incomplete understanding of how the 61 ligand binding on SUR regulates the activity of the Kir6 channel. Structural studies have 62 predominantly revealed a propeller architecture of the pancreatic KATP channel. However, it is 63 worth noting that one study observed both the propeller form and the quatrefoil form of the 64\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

(Lee et al., 2017). Strikingly, the same phenomenon 65 was observed in the vascular KATP channel in the inhibitory condition (Kir6.1+SUR2B) (Sung 66 et al., 2021). The transition from the propeller form to the quatrefoil form of the SUR subunits 67 involves significant structural changes and rearrangements of the inter-domain interfaces. 68 However, the biological significance of these two distinct architectures, particularly the 69 quatrefoil form, is still largely unknown. Further research is needed to uncover the functional 70 implications and role of these different structural conformations in the activity of the KATP 71 channel. 72\nIn our study, we propose a revised two-module model for the assembly of KATP channels. To 73 investigate the role of inter-module interfaces in the inhibition and activation of KATP channels, 74 we employ structure-based site-directed mutagenesis along with electrophysiology experiments. 75 By manipulating and studying these specific interfaces, we aim to gain a better understanding of 76 how they contribute to the regulation and function of KATP channels. 77\nResults 78\nTwo-module model for KATP channel 79\nThe available structural data for both the propeller and the quatrefoil forms of KATP channels 80 indicate that the Kir6 subunit and TMD0 domains of SUR are tightly associated through a stable 81 interface (Lee et al., 2017; Sung et al., 2021). However, there are significant differences in the 82 relative orientations between the TMD0 domain of SUR and the remaining ABC transporter 83 module between the propeller and the quatrefoil structures (Lee et al., 2017; Sung et al., 2021). 84 Based on these observations, we propose that the Kir6 and TMD0 domains of SUR (1-214 of 85 SUR1 or 1-212 of SUR2B) form a stable core module known as KATPcore. This core module has 86\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Interface I involves the interactions 90 between KNtp in KATPcore and SURABC (Fig. 1d). This interface was initially discovered in the 91 pancreatic KATP channel (Wu et al., 2018) and later observed in both the propeller and 92 quatrefoil forms of the vascular KATP channel (Sung et al., 2021). It is important to note that the 93 existence of Interface I is state-dependent. KNtp binds within the cytoplasmic central vestibule 94 of SURABC, and the binding site is accessible only when SURABC is in the inward-facing 95 conformation (Martin et al., 2019; Sung et al., 2021; Wu et al., 2018). However, this binding site 96 is disrupted when SURABC transitions to the occluded conformation in the presence of Mg-ADP, 97 which occurs in both SUR1 (Lee et al., 2017; Sung et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022b; Wu et al., 98 2018) and SUR2 (Ding et al., 2022). Indeed, the state-dependent interaction between KNtp and 99\nSURABC correlates with the significant impact observed upon the deletion of KNtp on ATP-100 sensitivity (Babenko et al., 1999; Koster et al., 1999; Reimann et al., 1999), as well as the 101 binding and inhibition of insulin secretagogues (Devaraneni et al., 2015; Kuhner et al., 2012; 102 Reimann et al., 1999). These studies have provided evidence for the functional importance of 103 KNtp in modulating the ATP-sensitivity and response to insulin secretagogues of KATP 104 channels. 105\nInterface II is situated between SURABC and TMD0 of SUR1 in the KATPcore (Fig. 1d). This 106 interface can be divided into two portions: Interface IIin, which is located in the intracellular 107 region, and Interface IIout, which is situated in the extracellular region. In the structure of 108 pancreatic KATP in complex with repaglinide (PDB ID: 6JB1) (Ding et al., 2019), Interface IIin 109\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

This suggests that the stability of Interface IIin may be influenced by the 111 lipidic environment and could be sensitive to harsh detergent treatments. On the other hand, 112 Interface IIout is best resolved in the structure of KATP with the H175K mutant on Kir6.2 (PDB 113 ID: 7W4P) (Wang et al., 2022b). Within Interface IIout, the extracellular loop 3 (ECL3) between 114 TM6 and TM7 of SURABC binds within a groove of TMD0 in the KATPcore. Specifically, V346 115 and F351 on ECL3, along with V357 on TM7, establish hydrophobic interactions with A90 and 116 L94 on TM2, as well as L167 on TM5 of TMD0. F345 on ECL3 forms a cation-\u03c0 interaction 117 with R168 on TM5. Moreover, F340, V343, and Y344 contribute to hydrophobic interactions 118 with I162 on ECL2, L106 on TM3, and V98 on ECL1, respectively (Fig. 1g, h). In the quatrefoil 119 structure, Interface II is completely disrupted. This indicates a significant conformational change 120 and loss of the interactions that normally occur at Interface II in propeller form. The disruption 121 of Interface II in the quatrefoil form of the KATP channel suggests that this interface is not 122 present or functional in this particular conformation. 123\nSUR1 mutant with ECL3 deletion could switch between states in a ligand-dependent 124 manner 125\nTo investigate the function of Interface II, we conducted a deletion of ECL3 in SUR1 (residues 126 340-352 of SUR1) to create SUR1\u0394ECL3. This deletion was designed to destabilize the 127 extracellular portion of Interface II. We then examined whether SUR1\u0394ECL3 was properly folded 128 and capable of transitioning between the inward-facing conformation and the occluded 129 conformation, similar to SUR1WT. Since glibenclamide binds to SUR1 in the inward-facing 130 conformation, leading to the recruitment of KNtp and inhibition of KATP currents in the absence 131\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

This indicates that SUR1\u0394ECL3 is capable of assembling with 135 Kir6.2 and facilitating the trafficking of Kir6.2 to the plasma membrane. Furthermore, inside-out 136 recordings demonstrated that glibenclamide was able to inhibit the current mediated by the 137 KATP channel formed by SUR1\u0394ECL3 (Fig. 2c, d). This suggests that SUR1\u0394ECL3 is properly 138 folded and retains both the glibenclamide-binding site and the KNtp-binding site, both of which 139 are crucial for glibenclamide inhibition. 140\nTo investigate whether SUR1\u0394ECL3 could adopt the occluded conformation, we utilized the 141 G334D mutant of Kir6.2 (Kir6.2G334D), which abolishes the inhibitory binding of ATP and ADP 142 on Kir6.2 (Proks et al., 2010) to only show the activation effect of Mg-ADP. In experiments 143 conducted with SUR1WT and Kir6.2G334D, the KATP channel was found to be activated by Mg-144 ADP, primarily due to the release of KNtp from its binding site. This activation by Mg-ADP was 145 largely abolished upon further deletion of KNtp (Fig. 2e, f). Notably, this Mg-ADP activation 146 was sensitive to the low-affinity insulin secretagogue, tolbutamide (Fig. 2g-i). Similarly, in our 147 investigation, we observed that the KATP channel formed by Kir6.2G334D and SUR1\u0394ECL3 could 148 also be activated by Mg-ADP and subsequently inhibited by tolbutamide (Fig. 2g-i). These 149 findings provide evidence that SUR1\u0394ECL3 is capable of adopting the occluded conformation in 150 the presence of Mg-ADP, similar to SUR1WT. These collective findings support the notion that 151 SUR1\u0394ECL3 is well-folded and capable of dynamic conformational changes, transitioning between 152 the inward-facing and occluded conformations, in response to ligand binding. 153\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

To further investigate the function of Interface II, we deliberately removed KNtp 156 from Kir6.2 to disrupt Interface I. In inside-out recordings, it was observed that in the absence of 157 KNtp, Mg-ADP robustly reactivated ATP-inhibited KATP currents (Fig. 3a, b). This suggests 158 that Interface II is involved in KNtp-independent Mg-ADP activation. These findings align with 159 previous recordings conducted on the SUR1-Kir6.2 fusion protein, where the covalent linkage 160 between the C-terminus of SUR1 and KNtp essentially abolished Interface I (Ding et al., 2019; 161 Wu et al., 2018). Additionally, the Mg-ADP activation can be slightly potentiated by the SUR1 162 activator NN414 (Fig. 3c, d). These results provide further support for the functional role of 163 Interface II in mediating KNtp-independent Mg-ADP activation. 164\nInterestingly, when ECL3 on Interface II was deleted, we observed the complete abolition of re-165 activation by both Mg-ADP alone and Mg-ADP in combination with NN414 (Fig. 3a-d). These 166 results strongly indicate that Interface II plays a crucial role in transmitting the activation signal 167 from Mg-ADP binding on SURABC to KATPcore. Furthermore, we discovered a similar 168 phenomenon when ECL3 was deleted in SUR2B (Fig. 3e, f), suggesting that the function of 169 Interface II is conserved between both SUR1 and SUR2. These findings highlight the importance 170 of Interface II in mediating the transmission of the Mg-ADP activation signal and further support 171 its role in KATP channel regulation across different SUR isoforms. 172\nF351 on SUR1 is important for the stability of Interface II 173\nSequence alignments clearly demonstrate that the length of ECL3 varies between SUR1 and 174 SUR2, particularly in the region between residues 340 and 346 of SUR1 (Fig. 4a), suggesting 175\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Indeed, we found that when coexpressing with 176 Kir6.2\u0394KNtp, SUR1\u0394340-346 exhibited normal Mg-ADP activation (Fig. 4b). In stark contrast, the 177 Mg-ADP activation of SUR1\u0394347-352 was impaired, similar to the phenotype observed for 178 SUR1\u0394ECL3 (Fig. 4c). This suggests that residues within the 347-352 region of ECL3 are crucial 179 for binding with TMD0. Additionally, through sequence alignment, we observed that several 180 residues within the 347-352 region are conserved between SUR1 and SUR2 (Fig. 4a). Among 181 these residues, the side chain of F351 is involved in hydrophobic interactions, indicating its 182 potential significance in the interaction between ECL3 and TMD0. To disrupt the side chain-183 involving interactions within Interface II, we introduced a mutation in which F351 was changed 184 to glycine, resulting in the generation of SUR1F351G. Upon co-expression of SUR1F351G with 185 Kir6.2\u0394KNtp, it was observed that the Mg-ADP reactivation of ATP-inhibited currents was largely 186 abolished, closely resembling the effect observed with ECL3 deletion (Fig. 4d). This suggests 187 that F351 is crucial for maintaining the stability and function of Interface II (Fig. 4e). 188 Remarkably, when SUR1F351G was co-expressed with Kir6.2G334D, it conferred Mg-ADP 189 activation that could be inhibited by tolbutamide (Fig. 4f-h). This indicates that SUR1F351G is 190 folded properly and capable of transitioning between the inward-facing and occluded states in 191 response to ligand binding. Collectively, these pieces of evidence strongly support the 192 significance of the conserved F351 residue within Interface II and highlight its vital role in the 193 proper functioning of this interface. 194\nDiscussions 195\nThe propeller structure versus the quatrefoil structure of KATP 196\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

Although the extent 197 to which the deletion of ECL3 disrupts Interface II remains unknown, the functional impairment 198 observed in the ECL3-deletion mutant clearly highlights the significance of Interface II in KNtp-199 independent Mg-ADP activation. The complete disruption of Interface II in the quatrefoil 200 structure suggests that KATP in this form is defective in KNtp-independent Mg-ADP activation. 201 Interestingly, our results demonstrate that the ECL3-deletion mutants retain KNtp-dependent 202 glibenclamide inhibition, indicating that Interface II is not essential for this process. This finding 203 is consistent with the fact that KNtp binds to the central vestibule of vascular KATP in both the 204 propeller and quatrefoil forms, indicating the integrity of Interface I in both forms. It should be 205 noted that the currently available KATP structures are derived from detergent-solubilized KATP 206 proteins, and further investigation is required to determine the proportion of the quatrefoil KATP 207 that exists in vivo on the cell membrane. 208\nThe function of Interface I and Interface II of KATP 209\nKATP channels are fascinating allosteric protein complexes that arise from the association of the 210 Kir6 ion channel with the SUR ABC transporter. Previous research has demonstrated the 211 existence of functional coupling between Kir6 and SUR, whereby ligand binding on SUR 212 impacts the activity of Kir6. This coupling is evident in the unique gating characteristics 213 exhibited by KATP channels, including ATP inhibition, insulin secretagogue inhibition, and Mg-214 ADP activation. Understanding the communication between SUR and Kir6 is a fundamental 215 question in the field. In this study, we redefine the structural organization of the KATP channel 216 as a two-module complex composed of KATPcore and SURABC. Within this complex, two 217 physical interactions, referred to as Interface I and Interface II, are observed in propeller 218\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

In the following discussion, we aim to associate the known functional properties of 219 KATP with the structural changes occurring at Interface I and Interface II. 220\nThe ATP inhibition property is inherent to the Kir6 subunit itself (Tucker et al., 1997). However, 221 when the SUR subunit is co-expressed, it enhances the ATP sensitivity of Kir6 (Aittoniemi et al., 222 2009). This enhancement is partially attributed to the direct interaction between ATP and the 223 K205 residue on the ABLOS motif of SUR (Ding et al., 2019). The ABLOS motif is located near 224 Interface II and undergoes a conformational change upon binding of Mg-ADP to SURABC (Wang 225 et al., 2022b). Moreover, the KNtp region of the KATPcore binds to the central vestibule of 226 SURABC (Interface I), resulting in increased ATP affinity (Babenko et al., 1999; Koster et al., 227 1999; Reimann et al., 1999). This binding likely allosterically stabilizes Kir6 in a closed 228 conformation that exhibits a high affinity for ATP. Furthermore, structural studies have observed 229 the binding of KNtp to SURABC in the presence of ATP (Martin et al., 2019), providing further 230 support for this mechanism. 231\nThe activation of KATP by Mg-ADP involves two distinct processes: a KNtp-dependent process 232 and a KNtp-independent process. The KNtp-dependent activation can be clearly observed in the 233 Mg-ADP activation of the channel formed by Kir6.2G334D (Fig. 2g). However, when KNtp is 234 further deleted, this activation is completely abolished (Fig. 2e). Structurally, the dimerization of 235 SURABC induced by Mg-ADP disrupts Interface I and causes the expulsion of KNtp from its 236 binding site (Wu et al., 2018). The Mg-ADP activation of Kir6.2G334D suggests that, in the 237 absence of ATP, a fraction of the KATP channel has KNtp bound to SURABC. However, the 238 binding of KNtp in SUR1ABC was not observed in the structure of KATP in the apo state (Martin 239 et al., 2019), possibly due to the low occupancy of KNtp. To detect the presence of the small 240 fraction of SUR1 with KNtp bound in the apo state, a more thorough 3D classification approach 241\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.

When Interface I is completely disrupted in 242 the KNtp deletion mutant, Mg-ADP can reactivate the ATP-inhibited currents of KATP (Fig. 3a), 243 indicating the involvement of Interface II in this process. From a structural perspective, the 244 dimerization of SUR1ABC induced by Mg-ADP binding leads to an outward movement of the 245 ABLOS motif on KATPcore. This conformational change might result in a reduced affinity for 246 ATP and subsequent reactivation of the channel (Wang et al., 2022b). In the presence of both the 247 KNtp deletion and the G334D mutation, Mg-ADP activation was not observed anymore (Fig. 2e). 248 This suggests that KNtp-independent Mg-ADP activation operates by reducing the affinity of 249 ATP, rather than directly enhancing the activity of KATPcore. 250\nKATP activity can be inhibited by insulin secretagogues, which bind to SURABC. This inhibition 251 can be divided into two distinct processes: direct inhibition in the absence of nucleotides and 252 inhibition of Mg-ADP activation. It has been demonstrated that the direct inhibition is mediated 253 by Interface I, as both the deletion of KNtp (Devaraneni et al., 2015; Kuhner et al., 2012; 254 Reimann et al., 1999) and the fusion of KNtp to the C-terminus of SUR (Ding et al., 2019; Wu et 255 al., 2018) abolish this type of inhibition. On the other hand, the inhibition of Mg-ADP activation 256 in the absence of KNtp (Fig. 2g) primarily occurs because the binding of insulin secretagogues to 257 SURABC prevents the transition of SURABC to the occluded state, thus blocking the signaling 258 through Interface II. 259\nIn summary, the underlying structural mechanisms of three hallmarks of KATP channels, namely 260 the inhibition by ATP, the activation by Mg-ADP, and the inhibition by insulin secretagogues, 261 all mechanistically relate to not only Interface I but also Interface II. The concerted structural 262 changes in these two interfaces shape the overall gating properties of the KATP channel. 263\n.CC-BY 4.0 International licenseavailable under a (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder, who has granted bioRxiv a license to display the preprint in perpetuity.
