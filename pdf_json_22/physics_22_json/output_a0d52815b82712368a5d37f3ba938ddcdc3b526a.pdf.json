    "abstractText": "In this article, we test the possibility of building new black-bounce spacetimes with changes in the area in the context of general relativity in four dimensions. These new metrics can present extra structures, such as antithroats. We see two regions where the area goes to infinity, and, depending on the model, one of these regions presents curvature singularities. Regular metrics can be extended to negative values of the radial coordinate and have a symmetrical structure, whereas some singular cases cannot be extended and have no symmetrical structure. The energy conditions are analyzed, and, for some cases, at least one of the inequalities in the null energy condition is not respected. We also presented models that satisfied the null energy condition outside the event horizon. The event horizon hides the throats of these models.",

These new metrics can present extra structures, such as antithroats. We see two regions where the area goes to infinity, and, depending on the model, one of these regions presents curvature singularities. Regular metrics can be extended to negative values of the radial coordinate and have a symmetrical structure, whereas some singular cases cannot be extended and have no symmetrical structure. The energy conditions are analyzed, and, for some cases, at least one of the inequalities in the null energy condition is not respected. We also presented models that satisfied the null energy condition outside the event horizon. The event horizon hides the throats of these models.\nPACS numbers: 04.50.Kd,04.70.Bw\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIn the study of black holes, one of the main themes that arise is the singularity problem [1, 2]. Singularities are points or sets of points where geodesics are interrupted [3], it means that the spacetime time is geodesically incomplete. Since light propagates through null geodesics, the presence of singularities becomes a problem for information propagation [4]. There are several types of singularities [5]. Among them, one of the most commented is the curvature singularities, divergences that appear in the curvature invariants [3, 6]. The fact that there are no divergences in the curvature invariants tells us only that such a space-time does not present curvature singularities and, therefore, can still present other singularities [7].\nAlthough singularities are expected in black hole solutions, what characterizes a black hole is not the existence of a singularity, but the presence of an event horizon [4, 8]. So, in principle, it is possible to build solutions for black holes that do not present singularities, a regular black hole1. Bardeen presented the first nonsingular black hole solution in 1968 [10]. Despite representing a black hole, the Bardeen solution presented a new parameter that did not allow us to interpret the metric as a solution to Einstein equations for the vacuum. Many years after Bardeen\u2019s proposal, Eloy Ayon-Beato and Alberto Garcia considered this parameter to be the charge of a magnetic monopole. They found the Bardeen solution using Einstein equations with a stress-energy tensor for nonlinear electrodynamics [11]. There are various works about regular black holes considering different gravitational theories or nonlinear electrodynamics [12\u201335].\nSimpson and Visser proposed another type of regular solution [36]. Like Bardeen\u2019s case, this solution has a parameter with no physical interpretation. This parameter modifies the structure of the solution in such a way that there is an area with a nonzero minimum [37]. This minimum represents a throat [36]. Depending on the parameter\u2019s value, we can have a black hole, a regular black hole, or a wormhole [36]. This characteristic of having a throat inside the event horizon and the possibility of the solution transiting between a regular black hole and a wormhole is what defines a black-bounce. Recently, new works have emerged to understand the content of matter that forms this type of solution. In these works, the Simpson-Visser element is obtained when considering the presence of nonlinear electrodynamics with a phantom scalar field [38, 39]. Other works analyzed the solution properties such as geodesics, absorption, shadows, quasi-normal modes, and others [40\u201347].\nIn addition to the Simpson-Visser solution, there are other black-bounce solutions. In [48], Huang and Yang find a blackbounce solution using a phantom scalar field coupled with linear electrodynamics. In [6], Lobo and collaborators proposed several black-bounce models. Some of these novel black-bounce solutions present interesting characteristics as more than one\n\u2217Electronic address: esialg@gmail.com \u2020Electronic address: marco2s303@gmail.com 1 For a review on this topic, see the ref. [9].\n2 photon orbit [42]. Extra photon rings generate modifications in the black-bounce shadow [43, 44]. These solutions also present gravitational waves echos [45].\nThe Simpson-Visser solution and the novel black-bounce solutions can represent a wormhole if the new parameter takes on specific values. These wormholes have only one throat. In the literature, due to the couple with a scalar field, there are wormhole models with more than one throat, and even anti-throats [49\u201354], which, considering a spherically symmetric spacetime, is a 2-dimensional constant-time hyper-surface of local maximum area [55]. So, it may be possible to build solutions that present a wormhole with more than one throat/anti-throat at some limit. This type of solution will require modifications to the wormhole area since the presence of the throat/anti-throat arises from the structure of the wormhole area. In this way, since the blackbounce models presented so far can only interpolate between black holes and wormholes with a single throat, it is interesting to seek new proposals that can encompass other types of wormholes. Therefore, new black-bounce models should be able to, depending on the chosen parameters, describe wormholes with multiple throats/anti-throats. This is the type of model we aim to explore through this work.\nThe structure of this article is organized as follows. In SEC. II, we present in general the tools that will be used to analyze the metrics, such as regularity and energy conditions. The new singular and regular black-bounce are present in SEC. III. Section IV presents our conclusions and perspectives.\nWe adopt the metric signature (+,\u2212,\u2212,\u2212). We shall work in geometrodynamic units where G = ~ = c = 1."

(12)\nThis result tell us that the energy density and the radial pressure are continuous in any possible horizon.\nThe standard energy conditions [56] for the stress-energy tensor (4), are given by the inequalities2\nNEC1,2 = WEC1,2 = SEC1,2 \u21d0\u21d2 \u03c1+ pr,t \u2265 0, (13) SEC3 \u21d0\u21d2 \u03c1+ pr + 2pt \u2265 0, (14) DEC1,2 \u21d0\u21d2 \u03c1\u2212 |pr,t| \u2265 0 \u21d0\u21d2 (\u03c1+ pr,t \u2265 0) and (\u03c1\u2212 pr,t \u2265 0), (15) DEC3 = WEC3 \u21d0\u21d2 \u03c1 \u2265 0, (16)\nAs part of the dominant energy condition is already in the null energy condition, we will consider only DEC1,2 =\u21d2 \u03c1\u2212pr,t \u2265 0. Outside any event horizon that might be present we must have f(r) > 0. Also \u03a3(r) > 0 everywhere. So we easily verify that NEC1 = WEC1 = SEC1 all exhibit negative values outside the event horizon whenever \u03a3 \u2032\u2032(r) > 0. Thus the NEC, and so all energy conditions, are violated for black-bounce models whenever \u03a3\u2032\u2032(r) > 0. As \u03c1 and pr are continuous across the horizon, NEC1 = WEC1 = SEC1 and DEC1 are also continuous. As the energy density is continuous, WEC3 also is. The remain energy conditions are not necessarily continuous across the event horizon."

(17)\nTo find new black-bounces that generalize the Simpson\u2013Visser model, we will fix f(r) as (17) and test different models of \u03a3(r). We first consider a general black-bounce model that is given by\n\u03a3(r) =\n\u221a\n(r2n1 + d2n1) 1/n1 e(b2/(c1r2+c2r+c3)) n2 , f(r) = 1\u2212 2m\u221a r2 + a2 .

The constants b, d, and c2 have the dimension of length, c3 length squared, and n1, n2, and c1 are dimensionless. The form of the function \u03a3(r) is chosen such that we can recover the Simpson\u2013 Visser solution by an appropriate choice of parameters, and that we can recover Schwarzschild and Minkowski solutions in the appropriate limit. To d = a, n1 = 1 and b = 0 we recover the Simpson\u2013Visser solution. Furthermore, the shape of the \u03a3(r) allows us to obtain models with more complex causal structures, including, for example, multiple throats and the addition of anti-throats. Additionally, it enables us to locally satisfy energy conditions that were previously always violated in known black-bounce spacetimes.\n2 Subindices 1 and 2 appear when the energy condition is related to radial and tangential pressure, respectively. In the case of subindice 3, there are two different\nsituations; the first is when the energy condition is related only to the energy density, which is the dominant and weak cases; the second is when we have the presence of all fluid quantities, which is the strong case.\n4"

(19)\nThe area becomes\nA = 4\u03c0r2eb 2/r2 . (20)\nThis area is symmetric to r \u2192 \u2212r. In the Simpson\u2013Visser solution, the area is infinite to r \u2192 \u00b1\u221e. To the model (19), there is no need to consider negative radial coordinate values, since the area is infinity to r \u2192 \u221e and r \u2192 0. To analyze the maximums and minimums we need to solve A\u2032(r) = 0. We find that the area has extremes values at r = \u00b1b, where A = 4\u03c0b2e and A\u2032\u2032 = 16\u03c0e > 0. As A\u2032\u2032(r = \u00b1b) > 0, r = \u00b1b represents minimum values of the area. In this case, b is a throat. Let us impose rT = \u221a eb < rH = \u221a 4m2 \u2212 a2, where rT is the radius of the throat and rH is the radius of the event horizon, so that the throat is located inside the event horizon.\nAs the Simpson\u2013Visser model, f(r), f(r)\u2032, and f(r)\u2032\u2032, to the model (19), are finite everywhere, in other words, these functions satisfy the condition of regularity. The function \u03a3 is non-zero everywhere, so also satisfies the condition of regularity. The problem arises due to the fact that \u03a3\u2032(r) and \u03a3\u2032\u2032(r) are singular at r = 0. So that, we are not able to guarantee the regularity of the spacetime and we need to analyze K .

If a = 2m, the Kretschmann scalar behaves as K \u221d r\u22128 to r \u2192 0. Thus, this spacetime is composed of an event horizon which contains a singularity at r = 0, and a throat located between the event horizon and the singularity. The causal structure of this spacetime and the others presented in this study can be analyzed through the Carter-Penrose diagrams, which are provided in Appendix A.\nFrom the null energy condition, we find that\nNEC1 \u21d0\u21d2 \u2212 2b2 ( b2 + r2 )\n\u03ba2r6\n(\n1\u2212 2m\u221a a2 + r2\n)\n\u2265 0, to f(r) > 0, (22)\nNEC1 \u21d0\u21d2 2b2 ( b2 + r2 )\n\u03ba2r6\n(\n1\u2212 2m\u221a a2 + r2\n)\n\u2265 0, to f(r) < 0. (23)\nIt is known that, if the null energy condition is violated, all energy conditions are also violated. From Eq. (22), NEC1 will be satisfied only to r \u2264 \u221a 4m2 \u2212 a2. However, this region is inside the event horizon, where t is the spacelike coordinate, and Eq. (22) has no validity. Inside the event horizon, NEC1 is determined by Eq. (23) and, according to this equation, is violated in that region. By properly choosing the parameters, it is possible to satisfy NEC2 outside the horizon, however, as NEC1 is not satisfied, the null energy condition is still violated."

(26)\nWe need b2/8 > c3 > 0 to r2 and r3 be real and different from each other. If c3 = 0, we find that the area has only one extreme value, which is r = b2/(2m). This point is a minimum, once we have A\u2032\u2032(r = b2/(2m)) = 8\u03c0e2 > 0. This structure is similar to the previous case with the difference that the throat is now located in r = b2/(2m).\nIn the limit r \u2192 0, we find that the Kretschmann scalar, with c3 = 0, behaves as\nK \u2248 3b 8(a\u2212 2m)2 4a2m4r8 \u2212 2b 6(a\u2212 2m)2 a2m3r7 +O\n(\n1\nr6\n)\n, (27)\nso that, there is a curvature singularity in r = 0.

(29)\nIn addition to NEC1, NEC2 is also violated both inside and outside the event horizon. We see that the null energy condition is everywhere violated.\nIn the case where c3 = b 2/8, we get\nA = 4\u03c0r2e 8b2 b2+8mr , A\u2032 = 8\u03c0re\n8b2\nb2+8mr ( b2 \u2212 8mr )2\n(b2 + 8mr)2 .

In the extrema points we find A\u2032\u2032(r = 0) = 8e8\u03c0 and A\u2032\u2032(r = b2/8m) = 0, which means that we have a minimum point and an inflection point.\nIn general, there are three extrema points, (26). In Fig. 1 we see that to c3 = 0 there is only a nonzero minimum point, which represents a throat. To c3 = b\n2/16m there are two minimum, but one of them is at r = 0, and a maximum, which is an anti-throat. To c3 = b\n2/8m there is a minimum and a inflection point. If c3 6= 0, r \u2192 0 is point of minimum. The analytical expression for the Kretschmann scalar is not simple but to r \u2192 0 we find\nK \u2248 4e\u2212\n2b2 c3\n(\na\u2212 (a\u2212 2m)e b 2 c3\n)2\na2r4 +O\n(\n1\nr3\n)\n. (31)\nEven with c3 6= 0, the metric presents a divergence to r \u2192 0. So that, to c3 6= 0, there is only one region that the area goes to infinite, r \u2192 \u221e. Even for a = 2m, we find K \u221d r\u22124 at r \u2192 0. As r = 0 is a singularity, one of the throats becomes singular. Thus, only one of them is traversable.\nIn Fig. 2 we see that the condition NEC1 is everywhere violated. Even for c3 6= 0, NEC2 is not satisfied in the entire region inside or outside the horizon, so the null energy condition is always violated."

It is interesting that for n = 0, the term that dominates at infinity is not the one that comes from Schwarzschild solution.\nThe null energy condition is analyzed in Fig. 9. As wee see, the functions NEC1 and NEC2 present negative values within the event horizon, besides that, NEC1 is also violated outside, so the null energy condition is violated.\n4.

(55)\nThis area is symmetric to r \u2192 \u2212r. The area has only one real extreme value at r \u2192 0, which is a minimum. This metric has a similarity with the case before. In this case the area obeys\nd2n\u22121A dr2n\u22121 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223\nr=0\n= 0, and d2nA\ndr2n\n\u2223 \u2223 \u2223 \u2223\nr=0\n> 0. (56)\n12\nIt means that the extreme point is a throat.\nThe Kretschmann scalar tends to a constant at r \u2192 0, and behaves as r\u22126 to r \u2192 \u221e. It means that the spacetime is curvature regular.\nThe condition NEC1 for this spacetime is written as\nNEC1 \u21d0\u21d2 \u2212 ( 1\u2212 2m\u221a a2 + r2 ) 2(2n\u2212 1)d2nr2n\u22122 \u03ba2 (d2n + r2n) 2 \u2265 0, to f(r) > 0, (57) NEC1 \u21d0\u21d2 (\n1\u2212 2m\u221a a2 + r2\n) 2(2n\u2212 1)d2nr2n\u22122\n\u03ba2 (d2n + r2n) 2 \u2265 0, to f(r) < 0. (58)\nClearly NEC1 is violated in all spacetime. With an appropriate choice of n, it is possible to satisfy NEC2 outside the horizon.\n5. Model \u03a3(r) =\n\u221a 2m2+2r2\n\u221a\ne 2m2 r2 \u2212 m4 2r4 +1\nLet us consider the model\nf(r) = 1\u2212 2m\u221a r2 + a2 , \u03a3(r) =\n\u221a 2m2 + 2r2\n\u221a\ne 2m2 r2 \u2212 m4 2r4 + 1\n. (59)\nThe area becomes\nA = 8\u03c0 ( m2 + r2 )\ne 2m2 r2 \u2212 m4 2r4 + 1 . (60)\nIt is not possible to find the roots of A\u2032(r) analytically. In Fig. 10 we see the graphical representation of A(r). There are five extremum points, two maximums and three minimums. It means that there are two anti-throats and three throats. To r \u2192 0 the Kretschmann scalar tends to a constant, and to r \u2192 \u221e behaves as r\u22126. It means that there are no curvature singularity.\nThe null energy condition is shown in the Fig. 11. This condition is satisfied outside the event horizon, and violated inside the\nevent horizon."

            "text": "In this work, we build black-bounce spacetimes using Einstein equations. The proposed metrics present two regions with an infinity area and at least one throat between them. Some black-bounces have anti-throats, regions with a maximum in the\n13\narea, and two throats. This type of behavior in the area appears in wormhole solutions [36, 57, 58]. The outcomes presented throughout this work can be succinctly summarized using Table I.\nBased on the curvature regularity of the spacetime, there are two types of spacetimes; regular and singular. In both cases, the throat is located inside the event horizon. The regions with infinite areas are located within the event horizon in the singular spacetimes. This infinity represents a singularity in the curvature invariants. At least one of the infinities in the area represents a curvature singularity. We also have only one throat and, in the case (24), there is also an anti-throat. In regular cases, both regions of infinite area occur at r \u2192 \u00b1\u221e. Unlike the other metrics, the regions with infinite areas do not present singularities in the curvature invariants. Depending on the parameters, the regular black-bounces have more than one throat; between these throats, there is an anti-throat. Wormhole solutions with anti-throats can appear when you have a non-minimal coupling with the scalar field [54].\nAll the energy conditions are related to the null energy conditions. So, if the null energy condition is violated, all other energy conditions also are violated. Almost all spacetimes that were built in this work present the behavior \u03a3\u2032\u2032(r)/\u03a3(r) > 0, which guarantees that at least one of the inequalities of the null condition is violated. However, the cases (36) and (59) satisfy the null energy condition outside the event horizon. In these two cases, only the dominant energy condition is continually violated. In contrast, the remaining energy conditions are satisfied outside the event horizon, the only region causally connected to observers.\nThe behavior of these spacetimes is similar to existing solutions where alternative theories of gravitation or scalar fields are\nconsidered. In this way, we believe it is possible to find the content of matter that generates them.\nUsually, black-bounce solutions can be obtained by coupling gravitational theory with nonlinear electrodynamics plus a phantom scalar field [38, 39]. The phantom field is responsible for violating the null energy condition. There are also solutions\n14\nthat are partially phantom. Therefore, it is possible that the spacetimes presented in this work are solutions for cases in which we have electrodynamics with a phantom scalar field, for cases in which the null energy condition is everywhere violated, or partially phantom, for cases in which the null energy condition is violated only in certain regions of spacetime.\nIn future works, we hope to find the source of these metrics. We also expect be able to study the thermodynamics. The problem with thermodynamics is related to the material content that gives rise to these metrics. We also hope to study the behavior of null geodesics since these geodesics are associated with the black hole shadows."

            "text": "In this appendix, we present the Carter-Penrose diagrams describing the causal structure for certain cases of black-bounces.\nThe black-bounce described by (19) features a singularity at r = 0 and a throat at r = b. These structures are located within the event horizon, and as a result, the causal structure is depicted by the Carter-Penrose diagram in Fig. 12 (a). In the model (24), within the horizon, there exists a throat and an anti-throat. Furthermore, there is a second throat located at the same point as the singularity, r = 0, rendering it singular. Consequently, only one of the throats is traversable. This causal structure is depicted in Fig. 12 (b). In the model (32), there is only one throat that, depending on the chosen parameters, can be located inside or outside the horizon. The point r = 0 doesn\u2019t present any singularity, it\u2019s just an arbitrary point in the manifold, but there is a singularity at r = \u2212c3/m. The causal structure of this model, when considering the throat is located inside the horizon, is represented in Fig. 12 (c). The model (36) features only one throat located at r = 3m/16 and a singularity at r = m/8. Thus, the singularity is situated before r = 0, but it still lies within the event horizon. The Carter-Penrose diagram that illustrates this causal structure is given by Fig. 12 (d).\nDepending on the parameter choices, the regular model (40) can exhibit up to three throats and two anti-throats. In the case where the number of throats is at its maximum, one of them is located at r = 0, thus forming a \u201dbounce\u201d, while the two anti-throats are located within the horizon, and the remaining two throats are situated outside the horizon. In this way, the Carter-Penrose diagram that best describes the causal structure of this spacetime is the one shown in Fig. 13 (a). The regular models (43), (46), and (54) basically present the same causal structure, since all three spacetimes have only one throat, located\n15\nat r = 0, which is positioned between the event horizons, Fig. 13 (b). Similar to the model (40), the model (59) can also have up to three throats and two anti-throats. However, in this case, all the throats are located within the event horizon, and thus, the causal structure is represented by the Carter-Penrose diagram in Fig. 13 (c).\n[1] O. C.
