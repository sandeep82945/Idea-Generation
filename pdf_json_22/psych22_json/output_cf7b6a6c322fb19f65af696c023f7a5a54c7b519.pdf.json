            "text": "Developmental dyslexia, involving genetic and environmental factors, is a hereditary and life-long neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by several deficits in reading and writing despite adequate intelligence (Association, 2013). Its etiology remains debated even after more than a century of research, but more and more evidences (Goswami, 2015; Ullman et al., 2020; Ara\u00fajo et al., 2021) suggest that developmental dyslexia might be interpreted by: (i) Poor phonological awareness; or/and (ii) visual-attentional deficits and abnormal eye movement patterns. Both possibilities may explain that the individuals with developmental dyslexia usually have well-documented difficulties in visual naming, in addition to their difficulties in reading.\nRapid automatized naming (RAN) tasks (Wolf et al., 2000; Georgiou et al., 2008; Norton and Wolf, 2012; Snowling and Melby-Lervag, 2016; Ara\u00fajo and Fa\u00edsca, 2019; McWeeny et al., 2022) have been proposed for measuring individuals\u2019 ability to retrieve and name a series of letters, numbers, objects, or colors sequentially as quickly as possible. RAN looks simple but is actually associated with a broad range of cognitive processes, including attention, executive functions (e.g., working memory, inhibitory control), and linguistic processes (e.g., phonological retrieval, visual-verbal connections) (Wolf et al., 2000; Georgiou et al., 2008; Norton and Wolf, 2012; Snowling and MelbyLervag, 2016; Ara\u00fajo and Fa\u00edsca, 2019; McWeeny et al., 2022). Its clinical utility has been reported in the evaluation of several cognitive and neurobiological disorders, including developmental dyslexia (Goswami, 2015), specific language impairment (Snowling and Melby-Lervag, 2016), attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) (Tannock et al., 2000), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) (Hogan-Brown et al., 2014; Zhao J. et al., 2019). Remarkably, more and more findings (Wolf et al., 2000; Georgiou et al., 2008; Norton and Wolf, 2012; Snowling and Melby-Lervag, 2016; Ara\u00fajo and Fa\u00edsca, 2019; McWeeny et al., 2022) have shown that the RAN deficits might become even more prominent in interpreting and characterizing the features of developmental dyslexia than other deficits in cognitive skills, such as phonological awareness, short-term memory, letter knowledge, and vocabulary. Furthermore, previous meta-analyses have documented the significant correlation between RAN and reading abilities across various reading constructs and languages (Swanson et al., 2003; Ara\u00fajo et al., 2015; Hjetland et al., 2017). Hence, it is hypothesized that the visual and cognitive patterns or features during RAN might be promising predictors of reading abilities and developmental dyslexia in children (Swanson et al., 2003; Ara\u00fajo et al., 2015; Hjetland et al., 2017).\nTheoretically, to better understand the visual and cognitive patterns or features during RAN, one should monitor the focus points in sequence and record the essential ocular activities during RAN, such as duration of time spent on some\nparticular areas of interest, rapid movements between focuses, scanning path, temporal-spatial series of focuses, and so on. However, traditional behavioral observation method cannot be competent for recording such the detailed temporal-spatial dynamical information during RAN (Wolf et al., 2000; Georgiou et al., 2008; Norton and Wolf, 2012; Snowling and MelbyLervag, 2016; Ara\u00fajo and Fa\u00edsca, 2019; McWeeny et al., 2022). Fortunately, eye-tracking method (Armstrong and Olatunji, 2012; Chawarska et al., 2013; Lai et al., 2013), among others, has been intensively used in psychology for decades to reveal the fundamental cognitive processes and mechanisms involved in reading and visual perception, and thus has the feasibility to characterize the essential features of RAN. However, to date, there are only a few studies (Jones et al., 2008; Hogan-Brown et al., 2014; Ara\u00fajo et al., 2021) that focus on analyzing eye movements during RAN.\nThe scales of eye-tracking measurements can be roughly divided into three categories: temporal, spatial and count (Weeks and Atlas, 2015). The temporal scales measure eye movements in a time dimension, e.g., duration of time spent on some particular areas of interest; the spatial scales measure eye movements in a space dimension, e.g., fixation position, fixation sequence, saccade length and scanpath patterns; and the count scales measure eye movements on a count or frequency basis, e.g., fixation counts and revisited fixation counts (Weeks and Atlas, 2015). However, thus far, traditional eye-movement measures (Wiig et al., 2000; Tran et al., 2014; Weeks and Atlas, 2015) have not considered fully the temporal-spatial patterns of eye movements from the perspective of non-linear dynamics or information theory. It is hypothesized that eye movements can be evaluated using more powerful strategies (e.g., non-linear time-series analysis).\nOn the other hand, the entropy, as a non-linear timeseries analysis method, has been successfully applied to reflect the complexity and irregularity of a system from the perspective of information theory. In particular, the entropy of brain imaging time-series data has been well documented its technical advantages in the evaluation of several neurobiological disorders, including developmental dyslexia (Katan et al., 2017), depression (Zhao L. et al., 2019), epilepsy (Acharya et al., 2015), ADHD (Joy et al., 2021), and ASD (Milne et al., 2019). Therefore, as a main motivation, we aimed to test whether the entropy could be applied to measure eye movements during RAN.\nTaken together, we suggested an entropy-based method to measure eye movements for the first time, which first mapped eye movements during RAN in a time-series and then analyzed the time-series by a proper definition of entropy from the perspective of information theory. By recruiting 408 children (206 males, aged 7\u201311 years), we aimed to: (i) Test whether the entropy of eye movements can gain better performance than traditional measures [e.g., total time of naming (TTN)] of eye movements; (ii) test whether the entropy of eye movements has\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience 02 frontiersin.org\na developmental trend in children across the age stages; (iii) test whether the entropy of eye movements may change with the task complexity of RAN; and (iv) investigate the association between the entropy of eye movements and the RAN-related skills evaluated by the number cancelation test (Xie et al., 2022), and between that and traditional measures (e.g., TTN) of eye movements."

Participants were required to name the stimuli sequentially as quickly and accurately as possible. To extend the application of RAN to developmental dyslexia in Chinese, we suggested a Chinese RAN (C-RAN) version, which substituted highly frequently used Chinese characters for English letters. As shown in Figure 1, the C-RAN paradigm in this study included three experimental conditions, depending on the format of stimuli to be named, i.e., Condition C1 (i.e., naming a series of numbers sequentially), Condition C2 (i.e., naming a series of numbers and Chinese characters sequentially), and Condition C3 (i.e., naming a series of numbers, Chinese characters, and colors sequentially).\nStimuli (shown in Figure 1) in each experimental condition were presented on a 21.5-in. TFT LCD monitor (1,920 \u00d7 1,080 resolution) with the participant seated approximately 60\u2013 90 cm away. A Tobii 4C (90 Hz; Tobii Technology AB, Danderyd, Sweden) eye tracker, calibrated using a standard 9-point grid, was used to measure eye movements. For each experimental condition, participants were required to name the stimuli (numbers, Chinese characters, or colors) as quickly and accurately as possible in a left-to-right and down fashion. To confirm that participants can understand the experimental rules and name the stimuli (numbers, Chinese characters, or colors) correctly, they were asked to do a preparatory task (i.e., a simplified C-RAN task with a 2 \u00d7 5 matrix of stimuli visually presented) before a formal experiment. Participants were excluded if their accuracy in the preparatory task was below than 0.8. It should be remarked that no participants were excluded in the current study due to their accuracy below than 0.8 in the preparatory task."

Our findings showed that in all experimental conditions, the main effect of age was significant, but the main effect of gender was not significant, and there was no any interaction effects (Gender: p\u2019s > 0.05; Age: p\u2019s < 1\u00d7 10\u22124; Gender\u2217Age: p\u2019s > 0.05).\nAccording to the statistical flowchart shown in Figure 2, we further utilized the Kruskal Wallis method and Dunn\u2019s post hoc for multiple comparisons with Benjamini-Hochberg procedure to control the false discovery rate.

We aimed to investigate how the experimental conditions and age influenced the entropy increases Dij defined in Eq.

Hence, we conducted a series of non-parametric two-way ANOVA procedures to reveal the condition and gender main effects as well as for their interaction. Our findings showed that: (i) The main effect of condition was significant in all age stages, but the main effect of gender was not significant in all age stages (Gender: p\u2019s > 0.05; Condition: p\u2019s < 1 \u00d7 10\u22124); and\n(ii) there was a significant interaction effect between gender and condition in 7-years children (p < 0.05), but there were not in other ages (p\u2019s > 0.05).\nAccording to the statistical flowchart shown in Figure 2, we utilized non-parametric multiple comparisons with controlled false discovery rate.

Hence, even when two children have the same TTN, they both might have different reading-related abilities. In the meanwhile, EME has been well-documented to reflect the complexity and irregularity of a system and illustrated its technical advantages in the evaluation of several neurobiological disorders. Therefore, it is not surprising that EME can obtain better performance than TTN in evaluating individual\u2019s RAN abilities. Figure 5 illustrated a case that participants had the same TTN (e.g., TTN = 18 s) but had different readingrelated abilities, such as EME, selective attention (measured by SA), cognitive speed (measured by SpC), and visual-motor integration skill (measured by ATC). This indicates that EME might be more sensitive to evaluate reading-related abilities than TTN (ignoring many dynamical details).\nFurthermore, we randomly added \u201csmall perturbation\u201d (e.g., rapid movements between focuses in the presence of skipping or omitting some stimulus during RAN) with different amplitude\nto the velocity of the original eye movement, under the condition that TTN remained unchanged. Figure 6 summarized our results in 11-years children and showed that the entropy increases Dij basically increased with the amplitude of small perturbation, but TTN remained unchanged. This implies that the entropy may reflect small perturbation of eye movements and thus have higher sensitivity, but traditional eye-movement measure (e.g., TTN) may not."

However, traditional measures of eye movements ignore many details about the visual and cognitive processing of RAN, and are usually associated with the duration of time spent on some particular areas of interest, first fixation, fixation counts, revisited fixation counts, saccadic velocities, or saccadic amplitudes. To cope with the drawback of traditional measures, we suggested an entropy-based method to measure eye movements for the first time, which first mapped eye movements during RAN into a time-series (containing detailed dynamical information of eye movements), and then analyzed the time-series by a proper definition of entropy. Findings showed that the entropy of eye movements was more sensitive to reflect small perturbation (e.g., rapid movements between focuses in the presence of skipping or omitting some stimulus) of eye movements during RAN, and thus gained better performance than traditional measures (e.g., TTN). This may be interpreted by the fact that the entropy, reflecting the complexity and irregularity of a system, has well-documented its clinical utility in the evaluation of several neurobiological disorders.

TTN, total time of naming.\nentropy of eye movements significantly deceased with the age and the task complexity of RAN.\nTo illustrate the effectiveness of EME measure, we required to test whether there were strong correlations between EME and traditional measures of eye movements, as well as that between EME and other RAN-related skills. Findings showed that: (i) There was a significant positive association between EME and TTN in all experimental conditions (p\u2019s < 1 \u00d7 10\u22124); (ii) There were significant negative associations between SA and EME, and between SpC and EME in three conditions (p\u2019s < 1 \u00d7 10\u22124); and (iii) There was a significant positive association between ATC and EME in three conditions (p\u2019s < 1 \u00d7 10\u22124). This implies that children with lower EME might have lower TTN and ATC, and higher SA and SpC. On the other hand, individuals with lower TTN may have higher RAN abilities; while, individuals with lower ATC and higher SA and SpC may have better performance during NCT. Hence, children with lower EME may have higher RAN abilities and better performance during NCT; while, children with higher EME may have lower RAN abilities and worse performance during NCT. This finding supports that the EME increase or reduction might be considered as a feature to identify the difference of RAN between typically developmental children and children with developmental dyslexia or learning disabilities.\nThe NCT was suggested to measure some RAN-related abilities, which involved cognitive skills in selective and sustained attention, motor inhibition, visuospatial search, planning, organizing, psychomotor speed, intact visualperception abilities, fine motor coordination, and sensory motor integration (Xie et al., 2022). It seems in theory that both RAN and NCT may share several visual and cognitive neural circuits because they both need a similar \u201cvisual scanning\u201d\nprocessing. In addition, NCT and RAN are associated with \u201cwriting\u201d and \u201creading,\u201d respectively. Hence, it is hypothesized that RAN, in combination with NCT, may bring some new insights into the understanding of developmental dyslexia and learning disabilities (Benjamin et al., 2019).\nRAN has been well studied in the evaluation of several cognitive and neurobiological disorders, including developmental dyslexia (Goswami, 2015), language disorders (Snowling and Melby-Lervag, 2016), ADHD (Tannock et al., 2000), and ASD (Hogan-Brown et al., 2014; Zhao J. et al., 2019). In particular, previous meta-analyses have verified the significant correlation between RAN and reading across various reading constructs and languages (Swanson et al., 2003; Ara\u00fajo et al., 2015; Hjetland et al., 2017), and thus, RAN might predict future reading across different ages, ability levels, and languages. More importantly, RAN deficits might become even more prominent in interpreting and characterizing the features of developmental dyslexia than other deficits in cognitive skills, such as phonological awareness, short-term memory, letter knowledge, and vocabulary (Wolf et al., 2000; Georgiou et al., 2008; Norton and Wolf, 2012; Snowling and MelbyLervag, 2016; Ara\u00fajo and Fa\u00edsca, 2019; McWeeny et al., 2022). Therefore, it is significant to reveal the essential mechanisms underlying RAN. As noted, our research was carried out along this technical direction, and confirmed that the entropy of eye movements may provide more perspectives and deeper understanding of RAN.\nDue to potential applications (Swanson et al., 2003; Ara\u00fajo et al., 2015; Hjetland et al., 2017) of RAN to interpret cognitive and neurobiological disorders, it is crucial to gain the normative data of RAN across a wide range of ages. However, this question has not been well investigated (Wiig et al., 2000; Hjetland et al., 2017). Indeed, thus far, there is an American normative data (Wiig et al., 2000), only. Even though the current study did not focus on a Chinese normative data of RAN, it still provided sufficient referenced information about the Chinese normative data in children aged 7\u201311 years, as well as how the age and gender influenced the Chinese normative data. In particular, our findings showed in children aged 7\u201311 years that: (i) EME during RAN deceased significantly with the age in a monotonic progression, implying a trend of entropy reduction with the increase of age; and (ii) EME during RAN did not differ significantly between males and females for all age stages. This is the first time to report such a result associated with the Chinese normative data of RAN. Remarkably, we showed that there were developmental plateaus in abilities in Condition C1 (i.e., naming a series of numbers sequentially) and Condition C3 (i.e., naming a series of numbers, Chinese characters, and colors sequentially) for 9\u201310-years children, and in abilities in Condition C2 (i.e., naming a series of numbers and Chinese characters sequentially) for 8\u20139- and 10\u201311-years children. In addition, our finding is consistent\nFrontiers in Human Neuroscience 09 frontiersin.org\nwith previous studies (Wolf et al., 2000; Georgiou et al., 2008; Norton and Wolf, 2012; Snowling and Melby-Lervag, 2016; Ara\u00fajo and Fa\u00edsca, 2019; McWeeny et al., 2022) that main effect of gender is not significant in RAN tasks. It is clear that: (i) The entropy increase D21, corresponding to the EME change from Condition C1 (i.e., naming a series of numbers sequentially) to Condition C2 (i.e., naming a series of numbers and Chinese characters sequentially), represents the influence of Chinese characters on the C-RAN; (ii) The entropy increase D32, corresponding to the EME change from Condition C2 (i.e., naming a series of numbers and Chinese characters sequentially) to Condition C3 (i.e., naming a series of numbers, Chinese characters, and colors sequentially), represents the influence of colors on the C-RAN; and (iii) The entropy increase D31, corresponding to the EME change from Condition C1 (i.e., naming a series of numbers sequentially) to Condition C3 (i.e., naming a series of numbers, Chinese characters, and colors sequentially), represents the influence of Chinese characters and colors on the C-RAN. Findings (see Figure 4) showed that D31 was lower than D21 and D32; and D21 was lower than D32. This implies that EME might increase with the task complexity of RAN. This inference is consistent with the previous researches (\u00c5vall et al., 2019; Georgiou and Parrila, 2020) that alphanumeric RAN (e.g., naming numbers or letters) may have higher cognitive complexity and activate a wider range of brain regions than non-alphanumeric RAN (e.g., naming colors or objects). It should be remarked (\u00c5vall et al., 2019; Georgiou and Parrila, 2020) that alphanumeric RAN tasks are more strongly related to future reading than nonalphanumeric tasks.\nIt is natural to adopt a Chinese version of RAN in the understanding of developmental dyslexia in Chinese. The difference between both the original RAN and Chinese version is due to the features of Chinese characters: (i) Chinese characters not only have shape and sound attributes like English letters, but also represent meaning; (ii) Chinese characters have no clear form-to-sound conversion rules, so readers need to remember the pronunciation of Chinese characters; and (iii) The visual complexity of Chinese characters are much higher than that of English letters. Consequently, compared with the original RAN, the Chinese version may have higher cognitive complexity, and thus activate a wider range of brain regions (Liao et al., 2015; Peng et al., 2017). To extend the application of RAN to developmental dyslexia in Chinese, we suggested a Chinese version of RAN (i.e., the C-RAN) by substituting Chinese characters (highly frequently used) for English letters. We expect that the C-RAN should be more suitable in the evaluation of developmental dyslexia in Chinese than the original RAN.\nThe entropy can be used to reflect the complexity and irregularity of a system from the perspective of information theory. Its advantages have been well documented in the analysis of brain imaging time-series for the evaluation of\nneurobiological disorders, including developmental dyslexia (Katan et al., 2017), depression (Zhao L. et al., 2019), epilepsy (Acharya et al., 2015), ADHD (Joy et al., 2021), and ASD (Milne et al., 2019). In particular, it has been verified (Acharya et al., 2015; Katan et al., 2017; Milne et al., 2019; Zhao L. et al., 2019; Joy et al., 2021) that the higher the entropy, the higher the complexity and irregularity of the brain will be. This inference has been widely applied to better understand the entropy abnormality in different context. Remarkably, we showed for the first time that the entropy may be extended to measure eye movements during RAN, and gain better performance than traditional measures.\nThe entropy reduction is a well-known and well-acceptable principle in physics, and thus can be easily used for data interpretation. For instance, we can infer from the entropy reduction principle that: (i) The RAN abilities may increase with the age, then the entropy of eye movements during RAN may decrease with the age; (ii) Individuals with higher RAN-related abilities may generally have lower entropy of eye movements during RAN; and (iii) RAN tasks with higher complexity may generally activate bigger entropy of eye movements. As noted above, those inferences have been verified in the current study. We expect that the entropy reduction principle can be applied to reveal the abnormities of RAN deficits and developmental dyslexia. Because eye tracking technique is fundamental for psychological research, the entropy-based measure method suggested in this study may have the potential to be used in a very broad prospect of applications."
