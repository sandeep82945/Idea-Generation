The limited solubility and stability of pea proteins hinder their utilization in liquid formulations. In this study, protein glutaminase (PG) was employed to modify pea protein isolates (PPIs) and obtain deamidated PPI with varying degrees of deamidation (DD, 10–25%). The solubility and thermal stability of these deamidated PPI samples were assessed, and a comprehensive analysis, including SDS-PAGE, zeta potential, FTIR, surface hydrophobicity, and intrinsic fluorescence, was conducted to elucidate the mechanism behind the improvement in their functional properties. The results reveal that PG modification greatly enhances the solubility and heat stability of PPI, with the most notable improvements observed at higher DD (>20%). PG modification increases the net charge of PPI, leading to the unfolding and extension of the protein structures, thus exposing more hydrophobic groups. These structural changes are particularly pronounced when DD exceeds 20%. This increased electrostatic repulsion between carboxyl groups would promote protein unfolding, enhancing interactions with water and hindering the aggregation of unfolded protein in the presence of salts at elevated temperatures (supported by high-performance size exclusion chromatography and transmission electron microscopy). Accordingly, PG-mediated deamidation shows promise in enhancing the functional properties of PPI. 1. conclusions Pea proteins were isolated from raw pea seeds and subsequently subjected to deamidation using PG enzyme, resulting in deamidated pea protein isolates (DPPIs) with varying degrees of deamidation (DD, 10–25%). The deamidation process significantly improved the solubility and heat stability of the DPPI samples when compared to the unmodified pea protein isolates (PPIs), with the most substantial enhancements observed in the DPPI samples with higher DDs (20% and 25%). The transformation of amide groups into carboxyl groups during deamidation induced a certain degree of protein unfolding, exposing more hydrophobic regions, while the secondary structure remained unchanged. Consequently, the enhanced solubility and heat stability can be attributed to the heightened electrostatic repulsion between carboxyl groups. This repulsion promotes protein unfolding, facilitates protein–water interactions, and inhibits the aggregation of unfolded proteins in the presence of salts at elevated temperatures. These characteristics suggest that deamidated PPI holds promise as a plant-derived protein ingredient suitable for liquid formulas, such as drink and dairy milk substitute.
