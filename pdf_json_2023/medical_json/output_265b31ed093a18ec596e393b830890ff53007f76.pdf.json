Although the relationship between the prognostic role of RDW and some cancers has been well established, the role it of RDW plays in DLBCL patients is unclear still questionable and requires more investigations. Methods: All patients diagnosed with DLBCL who had referred to Imam Reza Hospital, during were included in this retrospective cohort study. Based onRegarding their RDW, the subjects were divided into two groups of normal (RDW \u226414.6%) and elevated RDW (RDW > 14.6%) RDW, and the outcomes were investigated. Results: One hundred fifty patients with DLBCL were included in this study. The results showed a significant relationship between the RDW values of the DLBCL patients and stage frequency distribution, relapse, mortality, and complete remission (P value<0.05). It was also found out that elevated RDW > 14.6% was associated with the risk of relapse (OR=2.50, P value<0.05), mortality (OR=3.59, P value<0.01), and lack of complete remission (OR=0.115, P value< 0.01). The results of the survival analysis indicated that the subjects with higher RDWs had a lower median survival rate than those with low RDWs. In addition, the mortality risk for the individuals with RDW > 14.6% was 2.44 times that of those with RDW\u226414.6% (HR=2.44, P value<0.05). Conclusion: The results of this study well indicated that as an independent prognostic factor, RDW was associated with the stage of DLBCL patients, failure to achieve complete remission, disease relapse, and patient mortality. However, further studies are would be needed to realize determine the role of RDW in DLBCL patients.\nKeywords: Lymphoma- DLBCL- Red Cell Distribution Width factor- prognosis- survival\nprogression and biology as well as patient survival (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011). Some tumor-related parameters are PLT, NLR (neutrophil/lymphocyte ratio), LMR (lymphocyte/monocyte ratio), and RDW, whose relationships with tumor progression and patient survival have been demonstrated in various studies (Stotz et al., 2014; Chen et al., 2015; Salvagno et al., 2015; Schleicher et al., 2015). Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW) is one of the routinely-used, readily available, and relatively inexpensive factors used in CBC tests and is commonly and widely indicated for identifying various types of anemia (Patel et al., 2010; Koma et al., 2013). RDW is also a systemic marker associated with morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular diseases, hepatitis B, cerebrovascular diseases, septicemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD), and malnutrition (F\u00f6rh\u00e9cz et al., 2009; Lou et al., 2012). In addition, such a relationship between RDW and increased mortality has been observed in the general population (Patel et al., 2009; Patel et al., 2010). Recently, RDW has been recognized\n1Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran. 2Department of Hematology and Oncology, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran. 3Department of Internal Medicine, Faculty of Medicine, Mashhad University of Medical Sciences, Mashhad, Iran. *For Correspondence: kamandim@mums.ac.ir"

On the other hand, RDW values increase under the influence of MCV in chronic inflammatory diseases and improper nutritional conditions, affecting the morbidity and mortality of these patients (Douglas and Adamson, 1975; Ferrucci et al., 2005; Patel et al., 2009).\nThere is little evidence of the prognostic role of RDW in DLBCL patients. Having aimed at investigating the prognostic role of RDW in the patients with DLBCL, this study was conducted to recognize such a role of RDW in these patients so that it could be used as an important and effective factor in survival of the patients."

In addition, the final status of the disease outcomes in the patients, which that had not been determined in the study period, was collected and determined through phone calls. Furthermore, the patients were examined in terms of undergoing bone marrow transplant. Regarding the types of treatment regimens received, most of the participants had received R-CHOP (rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone) and CHOP regimens. As far as RDW was concerned, the subjects were divided into two groups of normal and elevated red cell distribution width (RDW \u226414.6% and RDW > 14.6%, respectively), and the outcomes such as the 3-year survival rates, and complete response to treatment, and as well as other independent variables were investigated examined in both groups."

To this end, the variables with a significance level of < 0.2 in the univariate model were also included in the final multivariate model, and the area under the ROC curve was used to check the fit of the model. The statistical analysis was performed using the Stata 12 software (Corp, College Station, Texas), and the significance level in this study was considered < 0.05."

In terms of the disease stage, the results showed that 56% (n = 84), 28.67% (n = 43), and 15.33% (n = 23) of the subjects were in Stage II, Stage III, and Stage IV, respectively, and t. The mean RDW in the studied patients was 15.13 \u00b1 2.33 with (rangingthe range of from 11.8% to - 21.6%). In addition, 52% of the subjects (n = 78) and 48% (n = 72) of the patients had elevated RDW \u226414.6% and 48% (n = 72) had and normal RDW> 14.6, respectively% as well.\nThe mean age and as well as the LDH and ki67 levels in the individuals with elevated RDW > 14.6 were significantly higher than in those with normal RDW \u226414.6 (P value<0.05). According to the results, there was a statistically significant difference between the frequency distributions of the DLBCL patients\u2019 stage and the Nnormal and elevated RDWs rates of \u226414.6% and >14.6% (P value<0.01).\nRegarding the relationship between the incidence of relapse and the patients\u2019 RDWs, the results showed that the subjects with elevated RDW > 14.6% had a higher incidence rate of relapse, and there was a statistically significant relationship between relapse and elevated RDW (P value<0.05). The results of response to treatment and the IPI of the patients also indicated well that the people those with elevated RDW > 14.6 showed significantly less response to treatment and had an IPI of > 2 (P value<0.05) (Table 1).\nThe Regarding the stage of the disease, the results of the univariate logistic regression related to the stage of the disease showed that the odds ratio of the elevated RDW > 14.6% in the patients with DLBCL in Stage III was 3.03 times that of Stage II (OR=3.03, 95% CI: 1.41-6.51, P value<0.01). The odds ratio in Stage IV was 3.37 times that of Stage II as well (OR=3.37, 95% CI: 1.28-8.87, P value<0.01). It was also found out that complete response to treatment (CR) in the patients with elevated RDW > 14.6% decreased significantly, so that the patients without complete response to treatment were about 8.69 times more likely to have elevated RDW > 14.6% than\nAsian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention, Vol 24 2669\nDOI:10.31557/APJCP.2023.24.8.2667 Prognostic Role of Red Cell Distribution Width\nthose with complete treatment response (OR=0.115, 95% CI:0.037-0.335, P value<0.01).\nOn the other hand, the patients with relapse were 2.50 times more likely to have elevated RDW > 14.6% than those without relapse (OR=2.50, 95% CI: 1.40-5.66, P value<0.05). The results of the multivariate logistic regression with the controlcontrolled of confounding factors (such as age, gender and clinical factors that adjusted in Llogistic regression) indicated that the disease stage and the incidence of relapse had a significant relationships with the RDW levels of the DLBCL patients. In other words, the individuals experiencing Stage III were\n2.90 times more likely to have elevated RDW >14.6% than those in Stage II (OR=2.90, 95% CI: 1.155-7.31, P value<0.05) (Table 2).\nThe results of the survival analysis regarding the occurrence of relapse due to the RDW levels showed that there was no statistically significant difference between the survival functions of the two groups with elevated RDW > 14.6% and normal RDWs \u2264 14.6% (P value Log Rank = 0.089) (Figure 1).

            "text": "The results of the present study showed the independent and prognostic role of RDW in the survival of DLBCL patients. It was indicated that the rates of response to treatment and incidence of relapse changed significantly with RDW and increased in the patients with higher RDWs. In addition, the patients with IPI > 2 and those in higher stages of the disease had higher RDWs as well.\nEvidence has also shown that high RDW is a prognostic factor in various types of malignancies such as CLL (chronic lymphocytic leukemia), ovary, lung, and prostate cancers, and some studies showed a close relationship between high RDW and stages of various malignancies (Spell et al., 2004; Koma et al., 2013). This is consistent with the results of the present study in which the patients with higher DLBCL stages had higher RDWs\nas well. Although the exact mechanism of RDW elevation in patients with DLBCL is unknown, some studies have identified hypertension, dysfunction of erythropoietin, dyslipidemia, poor nutritional conditions, oxidative stress, and inflammation as the main reasons for elevated RDW in DLBCL patients (Patel et al., 2010; Hunziker et al., 2012).\nThe relationships between RDW and IL-6, ESR, CRP, leukocyte, fibrinogen, and low neutrophil and hemoglobin have also been reported by some studies (Miyamoto et al., 2015; Vay\u00e1 et al., 2015). Furthermore, a significant relationship between RDW and erythropoietin and albumin has been observed recently. In the present study, a significant relationship was observed between RDW levels and LDH, ki67, IPI, and tumor stage (Rhodes et al., 2011; Peri\u0161a et al., 2015; Goyal et al., 2016).\nLi et al., (2019b) well indicated that RDW at Cut off Point > 14.35% was associated with worse prognosis in the survival rate of the DLBCL patients. Thus, the risk of death in the patients with RDW > 14.35% was about 2.652, which is in line with the results of the present study in which the mortality risk of the DLBCL patients with\nAsian Pacific Journal of Cancer Prevention, Vol 24 2671\nDOI:10.31557/APJCP.2023.24.8.2667 Prognostic Role of Red Cell Distribution Width"
