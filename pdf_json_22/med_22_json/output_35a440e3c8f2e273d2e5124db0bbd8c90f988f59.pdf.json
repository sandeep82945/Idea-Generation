ABSTRACT Introduction A substantial proportion of intensive care unit (ICU) survivors develop psychological impairments after ICU treatment, part of the postintensive care syndrome, resulting in a decreased quality of life. Recent data suggest that an ICUspecific virtual reality intervention (ICUVR) for postICU patients is feasible and safe, improves satisfaction with ICU aftercare, and might improve psychological sequelae. In the present trial, we firstly aim to determine whether ICUVR is effective in mitigating posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD)related symptoms and secondly to determine the optimal timing for initiation with ICUVR. Methods and analysis This international, multicentre, randomised controlled trial will be conducted in 10 hospitals. Between December 2021 and April 2023, we aim to include 300 patients who have been admitted to the ICU \u226572 hours and were mechanically ventilated \u226524 hours. Patients will be followed for 12 consecutive months. Patients will be randomised in a 1:1:1 ratio to the early ICUVR group, the late ICUVR group, or the usual care group. All patients will receive usual care, including a mandatory ICU followup clinic visit 3 months after ICU discharge. Patients in the early ICUVR group will receive ICUVR within 2 weeks after ICU discharge. Patients in the late VR group will receive ICUVR during the postICU followup visit. The primary objective is to assess the effect of ICUVR on PTSDrelated symptoms. Secondary objectives are to determine optimal timing for ICUVR, to assess the effects on anxietyrelated and depressionrelated symptoms and healthrelated quality of life, and to assess patient satisfaction with ICU aftercare and perspectives on ICUVR. Ethics and dissemination The Medical Ethics Committee United, Nieuwegein, the Netherlands, approved this study and local approval was obtained from each participating centre (NL78555.100.21). Our findings will be disseminated by presentation of the results at (inter) national conferences and publication in scientific, peerreviewed journals. Trial registration number NL9812.",

PICS is common, can last for years after ICU discharge, and has a profound impact on daily functioning and quality of life.6\u20138\nPrevention and treatment of PICS have been recognised as a fundamental part of ICU care by the critical care community and recently it was demonstrated that the psychological component of PICS is the most important determinant of a decreased health- related quality of life (HRQoL) and impede a patients\u2019 ability to rehabilitate.9\u201311 Although several interventions have been explored, such as keeping ICU diaries, organising ICU follow- up clinics, and offering psychosocial support, studies on their effectiveness in terms of psychological distress or quality of life have yielded unsatisfactory and ambiguous results.10 12\u201317 As such, evidence- based interventions to improve psychological recovery and HRQoL are lacking.\nPost- ICU psychological impairments may be caused by amnesia during the early period of critical illness in combination with sensory overload and sensory deprivation. Amnesia can lead to loss of factual recall of their ICU stay and patients can instead create delusional and frightening memories.18 Moreover, the typical ICU environment is characterised by unpatterned exposure and frequent sensory input such as light, noise and tracheal tube aspiration. The exposure to these extremes initiates the development of PTSD and anxiety.19 We hypothesised that exposure to the factual ICU environment, and additionally receiving ICU- related treatment information, could enhance ICU treatment understanding and subsequently could decrease delusional memories and psychological impairments.10 20\nVirtual reality (VR) allows users to fully immerse within a computer- generated three- dimensional environment. In psychiatry, exposure therapy using VR has been proven effective for the treatment of PTSD and anxiety, and thereby it addresses limitations of imaginal exposure.21\u201325 Also, VR can effectively and easily be used to deliver structured and uniform information to patients. VR could, thus, be a valuable adjunct to safely inform and expose post- ICU patients to the environment traumatising them and could enhance psychological recovery.26 27 In the current study, our primary aim is to assess the effect of an ICU- specific VR intervention for post- ICU patients (ICU- VR) on PTSD- related symptoms. Second, we want to determine optimal timing for initiation with ICU- VR, to assess the effects of ICU- VR on anxiety- related and depression- related symptoms and HRQoL, and to assess patient satisfaction with ICU aftercare and their perspectives on ICU- VR.\nMETHODS AND ANALYSIS Study design and setting A multicentre, randomised controlled trial will be conducted in ICUs of 10 hospitals in the Netherlands\n(Erasmus Medical Centre (university hospital), Franciscus Gasthuis & Vlietland hospital, Maasstad hospital, Ikazia hospital, IJsseland hospital, Groene Hart hospital, Van Weel- Bethesda hospital, Haaglanden Medical Centre and the Albert Schweitzer hospital) and Belgium (Cliniques universitaires de Bruxelles\u2014H\u00f4pital Erasme, Bruxelles) (table 1). The Medical Ethics Committee United (MECU), Nieuwegein, the Netherlands, approved this study (NL78555.100.21, approved 25 October 2021), and local approval was obtained from the institutional ethic review boards of each participating hospital. Inclusion will be conducted from December 2021 to October 2022, and patients will be followed for 12 months after ICU discharge. Any modifications to the study protocol, which may affect the conduct of the study or patient safety, including changes of the study objectives, study design, study population, sample size, study procedures or significant administrative aspects, will be sent for approval to the MEC- U and the institutional ethic review boards. Health authorities will be informed in accordance with local regulations."

The HADS comprises of 14 items and is commonly used to determine the levels of anxiety and depression. Seven of the items relate to anxiety and seven relate to depression.33\u201335\nHRQoL will be expressed as the overall HRQoL, which implies the time trade- of (TTO) score of the 5- level EQ- 5D, and the mental HRQoL, which implies the mental component score of the SF- 36.
