    "abstractText": "Defect states dominate the performance of low-dimensional nano-electronics, which deteriorate the serviceability of devices in most cases. But in recent years, some intriguing functionalities are discovered by defect engineering. In this work, we demonstrate a bifunctional memory device of MoS2/BiFeO3/SrTiO3 van der Waals heterostructure, which can be programmed and erased by solely one kind of external stimuli (light or electrical-gate pulse) via engineering oxygen-vacancy-based solid-ionic gating. The device shows multibit electrical memory capability (>22 bits) with a large linearly-tunable dynamic range of 7.1\u00d710 (137 dB). Furthermore, the device can be programmed by greenand red-light illuminations and then erased by UV light pulses. Besides, the photoresponse under red-light illumination reaches a high photoresponsivity (6.7\u00d710 A/W) and photodetectivity (2.12\u00d710 Jones). These results highlighted solid-ionic memory for building up multifunctional electronic and optoelectronic devices.",

But in recent years, some intriguing functionalities are discovered by defect engineering. In this work, we demonstrate a bifunctional memory device of MoS2/BiFeO3/SrTiO3 - van der Waals heterostructure, which can be programmed and erased by solely one kind of external stimuli (light or electrical-gate pulse) via engineering oxygen-vacancy-based solid-ionic gating. The device shows multibit electrical memory capability (>22 bits) with a large linearly-tunable dynamic range of 7.1\u00d7106 (137 dB). Furthermore, the device can be programmed by green- and red-light illuminations and then erased by UV light pulses. Besides, the photoresponse under red-light illumination reaches a high photoresponsivity (6.7\u00d7104 A/W) and photodetectivity (2.12\u00d71013 Jones). These results highlighted solid-ionic memory for building up multifunctional electronic and optoelectronic devices.\nKEYWORDS: MoS2, BiFeO3, oxygen vacancy, solid-ionic transistor, multifunctional memory\nTOC figure\nThe electronic properties of atom-thin 2D materials are sensitive to defect states intrinsically or adjacently. But there were few reported effective approaches to reversibly manipulate defect states for controlling carrier densities in 2D materials, most of which still suffer from poor stability, critical operation conditions1 and high energy consumptions.2,3 Solid-ionic gating is one of the recent trending methods to locally modulate carrier concentrations in low-dimensional semiconductors, which can dope channels with electromigration.4,5 Compared to traditional liquidionic gating, solid-ionic gating can accomplish local doping and efficiently exclude the risk of unexpected surface reactions,6 providing a precise and stable modulation on the active channel area. However, solid-ionic gating materials explored so far are usually limited by demanding temperature conditions and single-mode operation (electricity), which constrains the programming/erasing speeds and their applications in integrated circuits.7,8 For instance, AgI was recently reported as an efficient solid-ionic layer for electrostatically doping WSe2 channels, but different temperatures were required for programming and operating, and further environment cues were also needed to erase the programmed functions.8\nBiFeO3 (BFO), a well-known multiferroic material,9 has a high dielectric constant and is sensitive to various external stimuli,10,11 making it a potential candidate to modulate lowdimensional electronic channels for multifunctionality. More importantly, as a perovskite oxide,\nBFO has oxygen vacancies (VO2+, VO+) to offer donor-like defect states at 0.5-0.7 eV below the conduction band edge,12-16 which could be used to trap interfacial electrons induced by optical and electrical stimuli. On the other hand, the atom-thin two-dimensional (2D) material provides a model system where the surface states dominate the carrier dynamics, rendering an excellent opportunity to realize intriguing memory functionalities17,18 by the marriage of the oxygen vacancy in BFO and the 2D materials. Here, oxygen vacancies in BFO serve as gating and charge storage layer to modulate the conductance of the 2D channel above, nominated as solid-ionic gating, which induces solid-ionic memory. A solid-ionic memory transistor composed of molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) and BFO was designed (Figure 1a). Notably, such MoS2/BFO architecture greatly simplifies and generalizes memory operation methods compared to current multifunctional optoelectronic devices, because either electricity or light illumination can accomplish both the program and erase operations at room temperature. Though previous works on MoS2-PZT FET have accomplished intriguing memory operation mechanisms by manipulating polarization directions of FET and interfacial charge trapping, the solid-ionic transistor has an additional function of optical erasing to reduce the channel conductance by UV light.19 This benefits from that the oxygen vacancies in BFO can be efficiently tuned by either electrical fields20 (Figure 1b) or light sources. As a result, this solidionic transistor can be programmed by negative gate pulses and erased by positive gate pulses to achieve multibit electrical memory capability (>22 bits). Meanwhile, it was proved that longwavelength laser illuminations can induce persistent photoconductivity (PPC) effect21 in our device, which can be erased by UV light pulses afterward.\nRESULTS AND DISCUSSION\nSolid-ionic transistor: structure and working principles. A coplanar-gate architecture is used to control the process of electron injection and release process, as well as the number of oxygen vacancies near the MoS2 channel,20,22 where gate electrodes are either parallel or perpendicular to the source/drain electrodes (Figure 1a). Here we mainly used the parallel gates since the functionality of the coplanar-gate is independent of its angle to the channel, which provides diverse designs of device architecture for integrated circuits. The coplanar-gate architecture proposed here can productively simplify the fabrication method compared to top- or back-gate architectures.15 As a solid-ionic transistor, the high dielectric constant of BFO (\u03b5r \u2248 80)23 can rationalize the effective field-effect modulation with the relatively large coplanar channel-gate distance of our device compared to back-gate architectures.24 Estimated by the relationship between channel-gate potential difference and dielectric constant in the capacitance formula, the magnitude of the coplanar-gate voltages to switch MoS2 channel on top of BFO should be comparable to that of the back-gate voltages for the MoS2 channel on top of SiO2 (\u03b5r \u2248 3.9).22\nTo fabricate the solid-ionic transistor, 100-250 nm monodomain BFO was grown on top of single-crystalline strontium titanate (SrTiO3, STO) by pulsed laser deposition, followed by the dry transfer of few-layer MoS2 to be stacked atop BFO. The phase and crystallinity of MoS2 and BFO were characterized by transmission electron microscope (TEM) and X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), respectively (Figure S1 and S2). The cross-sectional TEM shows the stacking structure of the device, and the elemental mapping result of energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDS) confirms the uniform distribution of various elements in the corresponding materials (Figure S3). The coupling interface between MoS2 and BFO is shown in Figure 1c. The as-grown monodomain BFO is upward polarized and the uniformity of which is demonstrated by the piezo force microscopy (PFM) results in (Figure S4b,c). Oxygen vacancies and upward polarization contribute\nto the positively-charged surface of BFO, which significantly reduces the energy barrier at channel-electrode contacts and facilitates the separation of photogenerated electron-hole pairs in MoS2 for enhanced photodetectivity.25,26 More importantly, the oxygen vacancies in BFO can serve as electron storage media to trap and detrap electrons from MoS2, the amount and distribution of which can be controlled by optimizing the processing methods.27,28 As shown in Figure 1b, negative pulses (programming gate) can detrap electrons and inject them into the conduction band of MoS2 through tunneling or flowing along the tilted conduction band.29,30 The oxygen-vacancybased solid-ionic gating is enhanced after the electron transfer, which stabilizes the programmed states. On the contrary, during the positive pulses (erasing gates), electrons in the conduction band of MoS2 will be injected to BFO for filling up the defect states induced by oxygen vacancies. The trapped electrons will screen the solid-ionic gating effect on the MoS2 channel subsequently.31,32\nFigure 1. Architecture and working principles of MoS2/BFO-based solid-ionic transistor. (a) Schematic model of the device where vertical stacking of materials and three-terminal coplanargate architecture are applied. Inset: optical microscopy image of MoS2/BFO-based solid-ionic transistor (area of MoS2 flake outlined by the dashed white line). (b) Proposed mechanism for solid-ionic gating and solid-ionic memory. Programming/writing: increasing the conductivity of MoS2 channel. Erasing: decreasing the conductivity of MoS2 channel. The dashed red lines denote the electron trapping states at the interface between BFO and MoS2. (c) Side view of the atomic crystal structure of the heterostructure.\nFigure 2a demonstrates the output characteristic (Id-Vd) with a 5 V gating interval, which shows excellent and stable modulation by the coplanar gate. It indicates ohmic-like contact between MoS2 and electrodes, which is essential for building up efficient electronic devices. The electrical output characteristic at Vg = -10 V (see inset of Figure 2a) demonstrates a small leakage current, which contributes to the large ON/OFF ratio of the solid-ionic transistor. The large hysteresis in Id-Vg curves shows an outstanding charge storage capability of the solid-ionic transistor. With increased sweeping ranges, both threshold voltages of the forward and backward sweeping curves shift, which notably enlarge the memory window (Figure 2b). The largest memory window achieved in the measurement was around 192 V when Vgmax was 120 V, which could be further improved with more extensive sweeping ranges (Figure 2c). The inset of Figure 2c shows that the ratio of memory window range (W.R.) over sweeping range (S.R.) reached 81% when Vgmax was 110 V, which is very high among charge-storage memory devices.33,34 The efficient charge storage capability arises from the sufficient number of oxygen vacancies in BFO beneath, which is proved by the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) of BFO thin film as shown in Figure S5. A quantitative analysis\non the relative area between the major and minor peaks in the spectra indicate an oxygen atomic number of 2.14 and density of oxygen vacancy of 1.38 \u00d7 1022 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5a . The efficient charge storage capability arises from the sufficient number of oxygen vacancies in BFO beneath, which benefits from the stronger local electric field provided by 3D ferroelectric thin films compared to 2D ones.35 Such device architecture provides facile lateral migration of oxygen vacancies in BFO upon gate voltages, which was reported to explain the locally enhanced photoresponse around the charged domain walls in BFO.20\nSimilar to liquid ionic gating, the threshold voltages and memory window of our device depend on the scan speed of the Id-Vg curve.36 The memory window is enlarged by increasing the scan speed (Figure 2d), which saturates when oxygen vacancies cannot catch up with the voltage switching at a scan speed around 2 V/s (see inset of Figure 2d). A maximum ON/OFF ratio of over 107 was achieved, which is very high among MoS2-based transistors (table S1). The electron mobility with respect to the gate voltage is approximately 9.63 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5a \u00b7 \ud835\udc49 \u00b7 \ud835\udc60 , estimated from\n\u03bc = ( ) (1)\nwhere \u00b5 is the electron mobility, L is the channel length, W is the channel width and Cg is the gate capacitance.\nSolid-ionic transistor: electrical programming and erasing. To evaluate the electrical memory characteristics, a series of negative and positive gate pulses were applied to write and erase the solid-ionic transistor with fixed dwell time (~0.2 s), as shown in (Figure 3a,b). In Figure 3a, the device was erased by a +80 V pulse before each writing operation to make sure almost the same initial low-current state. As a result, the drain current \ud835\udc3c increased stepwise as the gate pulse changed from -10 V to -150 V with an interval of -10 V, generating 12 distinct charge storage states, which is in accordance with the proposed charge storage mechanism. The number of transferred electrons depends on the magnitude of negative gate pulses because of the different energy states of oxygen vacancies existing in BFO.37 While the increased magnitude of positive gate pulses has the opposite function, which eliminates the free carriers in the MoS2 channel to achieve lower-current states (Figure 3b). In Figure 3b, a -100 V pulse was applied before each erasing operation. \ud835\udc3c decreased stepwise as the erasing gate voltage increased from +10 V to +150 V with an interval of +10 V, reaching an ultralow drain current of 0.12 pA. Multiple electrical states can also be accomplished, as nominated by the numbers in Figure 3b. A higher number of charge storage states is essential for memory devices.38 Here, countless electrical states could be achieved by shrinking the interval of the applied gate voltages, indicated by the linear change of the readout charge with respect to the magnitude of the gate pulses before saturation.\nThe linearity of the readout charge with respect to the magnitude of gate voltage is demonstrated in (Figure 3c,d). The fitting line in Figure 3c shows that the readout charge (integration time: 1 s) is linearly proportional to the magnitude of negative gate voltage from -40 V to -100 V. According to our estimation, around 60.2 nC additional electrons were transferred from BFO to MoS2 by adding 1 V extra gate voltage within the linear range. The linearly increased readout charge indicates the sufficient amount of trapped electrons stored in the solid-ionic gating layer and the\nexistence of multiple defect energy states in BFO. Under positive gating pulses (erasing), the readout charge decreases linearly with gate voltage (Vg) for Vg < 60 V, and saturates for higher values of Vg (Figure 3d). Indicated by the slopes of the fitting curves in (Figure 3c,d) the charge transfer efficiency of the writing process (60.2 nC/V) and the erasing process (50.7 nC/V) are comparable. The ON/OFF ratio of readout charge (Figure 3c) shows that the solid-ionic transistor can achieve a linear conductance change with a large dynamic range (saturation/noise ~ 7.1\u00d7106 (137 dB)). The gate voltage dependence of readout charge demonstrates that the solid-ionic transistor possesses multilevel electrical detection and charge storage capabilities (> 22 bits).\nBesides charge storage capability, endurance and reliability of memory are also essential to the applications of memory cells. Field-effect transistors based on 3D ferroelectric thin films and MoS2 can provide nonconstructive memory capabilities with stable electronic states and interfacial qualities.19,39,40 Figure S6 shows the repeatability of the pulse-magnitude-controlled memory functionalities and the endurance performance upon fixed periodic ON/OFF pulses of 1500 cycles. Sample cycles are selected randomly to extract the readout charges after removing writing and erasing pulses, which indicate highly reproducible pulse-magnitude-controlled electrical states (Figure S6c,d). The result of the endurance test (Figure S6f) shows that electrical states are stable, achieved after removing the same gate pulses. The retention characteristic of the device is demonstrated in Figure S7a,b, where the contrast of the two dynamic current curves shows the influence of a single -100 V gate pulse on the solid-ionic transistor. In detail, the upper red curve exhibits the time-dependent drain current after applying a positive pulse (+80 V, erasing) and a negative pulse (-100 V, writing) sequentially. And the bottom blue curve shows the timedependent drain current only being applied by the +80 V pulse (erasing) as a reference. Two distinct electrical states are reserved in the writing curve and reference curve until the end of the\nmeasurement. The decay process of the writing curve was fitted with a two-step exponential function (Figure S8):\n\ud835\udc3c = \ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc52 / + \ud835\udc34 \ud835\udc52 / + \ud835\udc36 (2)\nwhere A1 and A2 are constants decided by the architecture and measurement parameters. Two relaxation time of \u03c41 and \u03c42 in the decay process are 1.42 s and 32.85 s, indicating multiple physical mechanisms embedded. The first fast decay step is mainly due to the drift of injected electrons upon constant drain voltage, overcoming the Schottky barriers through thermionic emission.41 It is believed that the tunneling of electrons from the valence band of MoS2 to the defect states of BFO for recombination with oxygen vacancies happens in the slow decay step.42-46 The fitting curves of the two decay steps and their corresponding contributions are plotted and analyzed in Figure S8. The increase of carrier density after writing with the -100 V pulse can be estimated to be 1.84 \u00d7 10 \ud835\udc50\ud835\udc5a around by the following equation, which is :\n\u2206\ud835\udc5b = \u2206 = \u2206\n(3)\nwhere \u2206\ud835\udc5b is the change in carrier density, \u2206\ud835\udc3d is the change in diffusion current density, \u2206\ud835\udc3c is the change in drain current, e is the unit charge, \ud835\udf07 is the electron mobility, \ud835\udc38 is the electric field, and \ud835\udc46 is the cross-sectional area of MoS2 channel.47 The result demonstrates that the diffusion of injected electrons upon drain voltage (\ud835\udc4a % \u2248 52%) in MoS2 contributes to most of the current drop after removing the gate voltage. The long decay time (\u03c42) in the second step is attributed to the substantial solid-ionic gating effect after uncoupling trapped electrons and oxygen vacancies. There are around 16% of the injected charges left in the MoS2 channel after a retention time of about 946 s, stabilized by the strong solid-ionic gating effect. Though the retention time of our solid-ionic transistor is limited by the lack of the separation layer between BFO and MoS2, which can relieve charge recombinations, the combination of large dynamic range and moderate retention\ntime solidate the application as a neuromorphic device of our solid-ionic transistor. Because the sufficient number of individual conductance states is more critical for efficient computing operations of neural networks compared to long retention time.48 Since the defect energy states were rearranged by the negative gate voltage to align with band bending direction during programming, and a positive gate was always needed to erase the device to the low-current state after writing (Figure S9). Change of the solid-ionic gating effect decides the magnitude and retention time of the memory states.\nOur solid-ionic transistor can fill in the gap of non-volatile and volatile memory by providing fast speed memory with long retention time based on a van der Waals heterostructure with outstanding charge trapping capabilities.49 Figure S10a,b show the solid-ionic transistor is responsive to ultrashort writing and erasing pulses with pulse width down to below 20 ms (Vwrite = -40 V, V erase = 50 V). Under fixed pulse magnitude, the number of transferred electrons increases as the pulse width extends. The direct electron injection pathway in our solid-ionic transistor boosts the speeds of writing and erasing operations efficiently by removing the blocking layers. The readout charges are extracted from Id vs. t curves (Figure S10) to analyze pulse-width-dependent charge storage and release (Figure 3e). The fitting lines (\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc54 (\ud835\udc44) \u2248 \ud835\udc4f + \ud835\udefc\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc54 (\ud835\udc61), where Q is readout charge and t is the pulse width) show that the readout charge is linearly proportional to the writing pulse width (\ud835\udefc = 8.3) and the erasing pulse width (\ud835\udefc = \u22123.6) up to 30 ms. The sensitive linear responsivity of the solid-ionic transistor to ultrashort electrical pulses builds up its practical apply capabilities. The charge storage and release responses saturate when the pulse width increase to be above 30 ms, indicating the fast electrical writing and erasing speeds of the solid-ionic transistor. Figure 3f demonstrates the mechanisms for the direct electron transfer between BFO and MoS2 under erasing and writing gate voltages with corresponding band alignments.\nCompared to other charge-storage memory devices, which need large gate voltages for the whole process (programming, readout and erasing), our device is facile to operate.2,3 Besides, the magnitude of the programming and erasing gate voltages could be further reduced by shrinking the channel-gate distance or replacing BFO with a higher-k dielectric material, which also possesses sufficient oxygen vacancies. Previous works on geometric engineering and defect engineering have successfully enhanced and manipulated the memory performance in diverse nano-electronics. 27,35\npulse in (a) over the minimum readout charge achieved after positive pulse in (b). The fitting line (in red) indicates the magnitude of the readout charge is linearly proportional to that of the negative pulse within the range of -40 V to -100 V. (d) Readout charge calculated by integrating readout current for 1 s right after each positive pulse in (b). The magnitude of the readout charge is linearly proportional to that of the positive pulse when Vg \u2264 60 V and stays at the lowest current level erased by higher positive pulses. (e) Pulse-width dependent writing with -40 V pulses and erasing with +50 V. The time-resolved drain current in writing and erasing measurement is detailed in Figure S10. (f) Mechanism of the electrical memory characteristics (The dashed red lines denote the electron trapping states at the interface between BFO and MoS2). The measurements were all performed at room temperature in the dark.\nSolid-ionic transistor: photoresponse. Distribution and energy states of oxygen vacancies are not only influenced by electrical stimuli but also optical stimuli,50,51 which functions in our solidionic transistor. Firstly, the photoresponse characteristics of our device were systematically analyzed under 650-nm laser illumination (red). Significant photocurrent was observed with illumination power down to 0.02 mW/cm2, indicating the good sensitivity of our device to ultraweak illuminations (Figure 4a).52 The influence of gate voltage on photoresponsivity is analyzed in Figure 4b. The photoresponsivity increases as the gate voltage increases because positive gate voltage can shrink the energy barriers at the two channel-electrode contacts, which contributes to the higher thermionic and tunneling current (Figure S11).53 A high photoresponsivity of 6.7\u00d7104 A/W was achieved at Vg = 47.4 V. To further quantify the sensitivity of the photodetector and rule out the influence of dark current, specific detectivity and photogain are also analyzed (Figure 4c). The highest specific detectivity and photogain are 2.12\u00d71013 Jones and 1.8\u00d7105 in the\nmeasurement, indicating a long carrier lifetime.54 Overall, our solid-ionic transistor shows outstanding photoresponse compared to other state-of-art MoS2-based phototransistors (table S2).\nAs shown in Figure 4b,c, the specific detectivity, photogain and photoresponsivity of our devices are reduced as the illumination power increases within the measurement range, indicating the reduction of trapping states and increment of charge recombination upon stronger illumination intensities. The nonlinearities of the curves in Figure 4b,c are due to the existence of multiple photocurrent-generation mechanisms. Similar to the mechanism of electrical programming, 650- nm laser illumination can also uncouple the shallow-trapped electrons with oxygen vacancies for charge injection to MoS2 channel by providing enough photon energy (> 1.9 eV).12 The resulting surface of BFO will become more positively-charged to serve as a stronger solid-ionic gating layer (photogating effect),55 meaning the relief of the gate screening effect.31,56 The enhanced solid-ionic gating effect not only enhances the photoresponse but also elongates the decay time of our device because of the gradual recombination of electrons and oxygen vacancies after removing the 650- nm light source. The existence of the photogating effect can be evidenced by the power law (\ud835\udc3c ~ \ud835\udc43 ), 57,58 where the exponent \u03b1 is extracted from the curves of gate-dependent photocurrent\n(Figure S12) and plotted with respect to gate voltage in Figure 4d. The exponent \u03b1 reaches the minimum value at the saturation gate voltage (Vsat ~ 30 V) and increases as the gate voltage decreases to negative, which indicates that the contribution from the photogating effect is the highest at Vg = Vsat while photoconduction gradually dominates as gate voltage further decreases. This is contributed by the aggregation of oxygen vacancies near channel region upon positive coplanar gates, which helps create more defect states in BFO. In contrast, a negative gate can effectively reduce the photogating effect and shrink the decay time of our device to function as a fast-switching photodetector (Figure S13). Whereas, the defect states for electrons will be fully\nfilled when the gating voltage increases to be larger than Vsat, which leads to the reduction of photogating effect and the increment of \u03b1 upon gate voltage in the regime of Vg > Vsat. A series of photocurrent mappings were performed under different gate voltages (0 V, -20 V, -30 V) to visualize the photocurrent distribution. The mapping images were collected by scanning the device with a focused laser beam (\u03bb = 532 nm, power = 10 \u03bcW) at Vd = -0.3 V in the ambient environment. The gate voltages were applied on the left side of the channel, as shown in Figure S14. The mapping images in Figure S15a-c demonstrate that most of the photocurrent was generated on the MoS2 channel, unlike MoS2 atop SiO2, where photocurrent was mainly found near the channel-electrode contacts because of the prominent Schottky barriers.59 The phenomena evidence the small energy barriers at the channel-electrode contacts of the solid-ionic transistor, which is contributed by the oxygen vacancies and upward ferroelectric polarization of BFO, as aforementioned (Figure S16). In comparison, the photoresponse of our MoS2-FET on BFO is much stronger than those on SiO2.59,60 Cross-sectional current profiles are shown in Figure S17, which were extracted along the midlines of the channels in Figure S15a-c. The photocurrent value in the channel region under different gate voltages does not differ a lot, indicating that the light modulation overweighs the electrical-gate modulation within the measurement conditions. In the channel region, the current level at the left channel-electrode contact is slightly higher than that at the right one because the drain contact is reversed-biased while the source contact is forwardbiased (negative drain voltage).61\nSolid-ionic transistor: optical programming and erasing. Charge transfer and storage characteristics not only can intrigue a high photoresponse but also optoelectronic memory\nbehaviors.62,63 Here, the photoswitching behaviors under different laser illuminations (blue 405 nm, green 532 nm, red 650 nm, UV 365 nm) were characterized to evaluate the wavelengthdependent photoresponse and optical memory characteristics of the solid-ionic transistor at room temperature. Our device shows sensitive photoresponse and color distinction capabilities under the three visible-laser illuminations. It exhibits PPC after the removal of the green- and red-light illuminations (stage \u01c0 in Figure 5a,b). The PPC effect can be eliminated by applying UV-light pulses later, leading to a much faster current drop (stage \u01c1 in Figure 5a,b). Experiment-while, the three visible lights were switched on for around 55 s (writing) followed by a silence time of about 10 s and application of a UV-light pulse for approximately 2 s (erasing). The decay time shrinks to 43 ms (red-light programming) and 83 ms (green-light programming) after the applications of UV-light pulses. Taking the red-light programming as an example, the decay rate of photocurrent is boosted from 7.5 nA/s to 2.5 \u03bcA/s after UV-light treatment. Dynamic drain current in response to periodic programming and erasing under red-light programming and UV-light erasing of 34 cycles solidates the good endurance of the optical memory function, as shown in Figure S18. However, no PPC effect is observed after blue-light programming (Figure 5c), and the decay rates in stage \u01c0 and \u01c1 are close, as calculated in Figure S19. Such wavelength-dependent photoresponse can be explained by the trapping and detrapping dynamics of electrons excited by photons with different energies. The bandgap of the epitaxial monodomain BFO is 2.47 eV, which is extracted from the absorbance curve in Figure S20. Thus, photons with energy larger than 2.47 eV can be absorbed by BFO to generate electron-hole pairs, indicated by the green arrow in Figure 5d. Some of the photogenerated electrons in BFO are captured by the oxygen vacancies to screen the solidionic gating (red arrow). Both photogenerated holes and electrons in BFO can flow to MoS2 through valence and conduction band edges, respectively (blue arrows). The initial low-current\nstate is obtained after removing UV light when defect states are filled by electrons, meaning that the gate-screening effect is resumed. During UV erasing, generation and transfer of photocarriers were faster than electron trapping, which leads to the small current peaks at the beginning of UV illuminations (Figure 5a-b). Since blue light can also generate electron-hole pairs in BFO to screen the solid-ionic gating effect, a normal switching-off behavior without PPC effect is shown in Figure 5c. The elongated rise time under red- and green-light illuminations of 9.5 s and 4.5 s also indicates the strong trapping effect proposed, which is typically much longer than the generation and drifting of free charge carriers, as analyzed under Figure S21.64 In conclusion, the synergistic effect of inter-band and band-edge light absorption contributes to the wavelength-dependent photoresponse and programmable optoelectronic memory of our device. Besides, the multifunctionality of the solid-ionic gating layer provides an approach to compressing optoelectronics by amalgamating a photodetector with a charge storage unit.\nelectron trapping states at the interface between BFO and MoS2).

            "text": "In this work, we have discussed and analyzed the electronic and optoelectronic characterizations of a MoS2/BFO-based solid-ionic transistor. The oxygen vacancies in BFO not only significantly enhance the photoresponse of MoS2 but also bring up optical and electrical memory characteristics based on electron storage and release. Our device can memorize gate pulses to accomplish multibit charge storage (> 22 bits). Optically, the device can be programmed by long-wavelength visible lasers (green, red) and erased by UV-light pulses. Notably, only one kind of external stimulus (light or electrical-gate pulse) is required to accomplish both the programming and erasing process, which significantly simplifies the operation modes of memory units. We attribute the multifunctionality of the device mainly to the solid-ionic-assisted trapping and detrapping of electrons upon optical or electrical-gate signals.\nThough the retention time is not desirable for long-term non-volatile memory devices, the solidionic device is highly potential to be used in neuromorhphic devices with particular applications to accomplish various neuromorphic computing activities, like paired-pulse facilitation (PPF)/depression (PPD)65 and Excitatory Post-Synaptic Current (EPSC).66 The electrical memory characteristics of the MoS2/BFO stacking maintain well with diverse architecture parameters and working environment, which is promising to be integrated into different brain-inspired electronics. Based on the concept of solid-ionic gating, a family of multifunctional electronic and optoelectronic devices could be designed based on particular pre-determined functionalities."

The stoichiometric amounts of molybdenum and sulfur (pure) together with 30mg Iodine (transport agency) were vacuum-sealed and positioned at one end in a quartz tube. The pressure in the quartz tube should be maintained below 10-6 torr. And then, the tube was placed in a three-zone furnace. The precursor zone and the reaction zone were heated at\n1080 \u00baC and 1000 \u2103 for around seven days, followed by cooling down to room temperature\nnaturally. BFO thin films were grown on single-crystalline STO substrates by PLD technique at the temperature of 700 \u02daC with an oxygen partial pressure of 100 mTorr. The laser energy density and repetition rate used for the film growth were fixed at 1.2 J\u00b7cm-2 and 5 Hz, respectively. The Raman signal of MoS2 was collected on a WITec alpha 300R Raman system. XRD of monodomain BFO was conducted on Bruker SMART APEX II (SC-XRD).\nDevice fabrication. MoS2 thin flakes were obtained by mechanical exfoliation of MoS2 single crystals and then transferred onto BFO films using PDMS as a transfer media. And the as-\nfabricated MoS2/BFO/STO heterostructure was later vacuum-baked at 80\u2103 for half an hour to\nachieve better contact between MoS2 and BFO, which is vital to the coupling between BFO and MoS2. Then electron beam lithography (EBL) was used to pattern the electrodes, followed by the deposition of Cr/Au electrodes via electron beam evaporation and lift-off process. Atomic force microscopy (AFM, Asylum Research Cypher S, and Asylum Research MFP-3D) was used to measure the morphology of the device.\nElectronic and optoelectronic measurement.
