    "abstractText": "The substantial changes in the workplace caused by the Covid19 pandemic restrictions have contributed to teacher burnout. The purpose of this study was to gain an understanding of the relationships between spirituality, connectedness to nature, and burnout in schoolteachers, as well as to investigate the mediating part of spirituality in the relationship between connectedness to nature and burnout, and the moderating role of gender. This study was conducted using a quantitative method, with a sample size of 123 schoolteachers in Malaysia. Data analysis using partial least squares-structural equation modeling (PLSSEM) revealed that schoolteachers who had a strong connection to nature were less likely to experience burnout. Spirituality acted as a buffer in the relationship between connection to nature and burnout. The results also differed according to gender for the nature connectedness-burnout relationship. Going forward, the findings of this study offer practitioners better insights about the importance of selected factors, including nature concreteness and spirituality as a promising avenue for reducing burnout among schoolteachers during online classes amid the Covid-19 pandemic.",

            "text": "As demonstrated by a growing body of data, those in the human service professions are at the greatest risk of professional burnout during the Covid -19 epidemic (Raudensk\u00e1 et al., 2020). When applied to education, a poll of US public sector employees released in October 2021 discovered that K-12 public schoolteachers were the most likely to experience increased levels of worry, stress, and burnout during the Covid -19 pandemic (Walker & Writer, 2021). When almost all occupations were affected, many switched over to an online mode of working, including the teaching in schools in which students and teachers had internet access. Many teachers were forced to change their teaching routines in a short period of time, which required them to acquire technology and didactic abilities, as well as to take on a greater role as a learning manager. This put an added external demand on the teachers (Mheidly et al., 2020). High expectations of teachers (for example, the difficult circumstance of school closures because of the COVID-19 pandemic) can harm their mental health and lead to job burnout (Wei\u00dfenfels et al., 2022). Since teacher burnout is connected to a high incidence of turnover in the profession, increasing public knowledge of the negative implications of online teaching in the Covid-19 epidemic and providing practical methods to cope with its accompanying mental health issues is critical.\nIn all modes of education, teaching has historically been viewed as a difficult vocation (Richards et al., 2018). Teacher burnout is a significant, work-related threat associated with extended and exhaustive job stress (Foley & Murphy, 2015; Pyh\u00e4lt\u00f6 et al., 2021). It takes three individual forms: the first is exhaustion, which is formally defined by a lack of effective vigor and a sense of being exhausted at work. The second is sarcasm, which is defined by apathy to engage in work, as well as sarcasm expressed toward co-workers at work. Finally, the third is professional inadequacy, which is formally defined by a reduced sense of individual accomplishment in the workplace (Pyh\u00e4lt\u00f6 et al., 2021). Many studies have established an association between teacher burnout and various negative outcomes, including less impactful teaching, disruptive behavior in class, reduced relationships with students, and teacher turnover (e.g., Perrone et al., 2019). If teachers have increased levels of burnout, their students also experience increased levels of stress and reduced academic accomplishment (Oberle & Schonert-Reichl, 2016).\nA substantial amount of evidence demonstrates that being connected to nature is a useful resource for lowering work-related stress (particularly burnout) (e.g., Yu et al., 2020). Tendais and Ribeiro (2020) discovered that when people are cut off from nature during a pandemic, their anxiety and stress levels increase. Disconnection is especially critical when seen in conjunction with the Stress Recovery Theory (Bratman et al., 2019), which implies that exposure to natural environments enhances recovery from stressful stimuli. Reduced access to, involvement with, and connection to nature also means that individuals are missing out on the benefits of nature for their overall well-being. This is especially true in a pandemic since research indicates that lockdowns and associated modifications in teaching practices, isolation from school, and fears of contagion have aggravated teacher burnout (Bignardi et al., 2021). Those with more frequent use of green spaces and views of green spaces from their windows fared better in\nhttp://ijlter.org/index.php/ijlter\na poll of Japanese adults performed during the pandemic. They mentioned reduced anxiety and increased overall subjective satisfaction, proving that nature can reduce the degree of the mental health issues seen by the pandemic (Soga et al., 2021).\nNumerous studies indicate that when confronted with stressful conditions, schoolteachers heavily rely on their spirituality (Matiz et al., 2020; Mirshahi & Barani, 2016). Previous empirical studies of public-schoolteachers in a variety of nations have demonstrated how teachers' spiritual beliefs and practices were used to cope with the numerous challenges they confront (e.g., Chirico et al., 2020). Spirituality is also relevant in understanding the beneficial impacts of nature on lowering burnout among schoolteachers via the ecopsychology theory (Roszak et al., 1995). According to this theory, one\u2019s 'ecological self' improves, based on a wide sense of spiritual and biophysical interactivity with the surrounding environment (Bragg, 1996; Wilson, 1996). This growth entails a shift in one\u2019s perception, a shift beyond the individualistic self-concepts, and towards a \u201cfieldlike sense of one\u2019s self\" that encompasses all of life\u2019s forms and the earth itself (Bragg, 1996, p. 95). Additionally, a prior study discovered that spirituality could mediate the relation between nature-connection and psychological well-being among Australians (Kamitsis & Francis, 2013). However, the relationship between spirituality and connectivity to nature and teacher burnout has received little attention. Understanding the roles of spirituality and nature-connection is thus critical for deciphering job stress among schoolteachers during the Covid-19 Pandemic.\nMuch previous research has identified a variety of socio-demographic characteristics as risk factors for teacher burnout, with gender appearing to be the most significant (e.g., Shadid et al., 2020). The body of literature has documented gender disparities in teacher burnout, connection to nature, and spirituality. According to the social role theory, men and women display distinct behaviors since they are socialized differently and have distinct responsibilities in society (Saad & Gill, 2000). Men are more proactive and self-directed than women, and they are more willing to take risks (Powell & Ansic, 1997). In contrast, women have more avoidant tendencies than men (Charness & Gneezy, 2012). Tamosiunas et al. (2014) claim that women engage more actively in nature-friendly situations than males do and gain more from them (e.g., mental health and stress recovery). A prior study discovered that mindfulness meditation had a beneficial effect on the mental health of Italian female teachers during the Covid-19 (Matiz et al., 2020).\nAgainst this backdrop, many studies describing the impacts of nature on wellbeing were first formulated a few years ago but have not been the topic of the new Covid-19 outbreak (e.g., Trigwell et al., 2014). As a result, a better understanding of the link between nature connectedness and teacher burnout during the Covid19 pandemic, as well as the function of spirituality, is needed. Furthermore, although many prior studies have identified a range of socio-demographic characteristics as risk factors for teacher burnout, no studies have looked at gender differences in nature connectivity, spirituality, and occupational burnout. Thus, the goal of this research is to investigate the relationships between connectedness to nature and spirituality, as well as the role of spirituality as a mediator between\nhttp://ijlter.org/index.php/ijlter\nconnectedness to nature and teacher burnout, and to show whether gender acts as a moderator in the relationships between spirituality, connectedness to nature, and teacher burnout."

Ecopsychology theory has been widely used in the human-nature connection. Spirituality, which is often thought by ecopsychology theorists to be experienced in and via a sense of connectivity with nature, might be significant to further an understanding of the positive benefits of nature on stress reduction. The formation of an individual's 'ecological self,' according to ecopsychology theory, happens in reaction to a wide sense of biophysical and spiritual connectivity to the natural world (Bragg, 1996). Stress Reduction Theory focuses on promoting psychophysiological stress reduction, based on the idea that natural stimuli may quickly trigger pleasant emotions and diminish physiological arousal and negative thoughts, facilitating stress recovery. Acknowledging these two theories, nature connectedness and spirituality identified as positive factors of schoolteacher burnout in this study, while spirituality and gender were identified as mediator and moderator factors."

            "text": "Job burnout is a mental condition characterized by a protracted reaction to working pressures (Madigan & Kim, 2021). Its most important characteristic is emotional fatigue, which is defined by a physical stress reaction that is closely linked to work overload (Pogere et al., 2019). One solution is that schoolteachers may psychologically distance themselves from their work in general or work roles as a means of coping with this pressure. According to Reynolds et al. (2018), exposure to nature decreases anger, fear, and stress while increasing pleasant sensations. Results from a previous experimental study of 40 participants with burnout and stress-related complaints indicated that participants in the walk-andtalk group improved more on burnout, stress symptoms, general mental health, and wellbeing than those in the control group (van den Berg & Beute, 2021). In China, Yong (2021) found that increasing students' sense of connection to the environment was a significant method of preventing academic burnout in high school students. To date, however, there has been no clear relationship between nature connectedness and teacher burnout. The current study, therefore, proposed the following hypothesis: H1: Connectedness to nature is negatively associated with teacher burnout."

            "text": "Spirituality is described as a person's inner experience and/or belief system that gives meaning to life and helps individuals to transcend their current circumstances (Burkhardt, 1989). Spiritual beliefs are linked to reduced levels of burnout, exhaustion, and depersonalization in various situations, according to most research (e.g., Trigwell et al., 2014). According to Lindholm and Astin (2006), teachers with a higher level of spirituality have an increased sense of integration and balance in their professional and personal lives, and improved alignment of\nhttp://ijlter.org/index.php/ijlter\ntheir values. Specifically, spirituality can be a useful resource. Bickerton et al. (2014a) found that spirituality was seen as an individual resource that was negatively related to burnout in a study of religious employees. Spirituality is also a common approach adopted by employees to cope with stress and burnout, according to the findings of a prior scoping review (De Diego-Cordero et al., 2021).\nIn Kamitsis and Francis\u2019s (2013) study on 190 Australians (132 females and 58 males), the mediating role of spirituality was examined in the relationship between engagement with nature and mental wellbeing. Spiritual well-being was validated as a mediator between nature exposure and connectivity to nature and was positively related to psychological health and increased reported spirituality, according to the researchers. Meanwhile, Trigwell et al.\u2019s (2014) study on Australians indicated that spirituality serves as a link between being linked to nature and one of the six aspects of eudaimonic well-being. As a result, we suggest: H2: Spirituality is negatively related to teacher burnout. H3: Spirituality mediates the association between connectedness to nature and teacher burnout."

Green had a greater influence on males than females in some of these studies (e.g., Jiang et al., 2014), while other studies found a moderating role of gender on the relationship between workplace spirituality and organizational citizenship behavior. However, no research has studied the moderating role of gender in spirituality, nature connection, and teacher burnout. Accordingly, the study hypothesis was proposed: H4.

In addition, the hypotheses, determination coefficients (R2), effect size values (f2), as well as Stone\u2013 Geisser (Q2) values were investigated at the structural model phase. The investigation shows that the data fit the model well since all models produced SRMR values less than 0.08, and NFI values greater than 0.8 (Henseler et al., 2016). While the structural model revealed a substantial positive relationship between nature connectedness and burnout (\u03b2=-.291, t=4.714, p=0.000), spirituality and burnout had a non-significant relationship (\u03b2 =-.143, t=1.148, p=0.251).

The outcomes of this study suggest that nature connectivity and spirituality are significant predictors of burnout in schoolteachers, both directly and indirectly. Connectedness to nature and spirituality accounted for 10.4 percent of the variance in teacher burnout.\nThe findings corroborate prior findings that relate to green spaces and scenes of greenery (e.g., planting, courtyard gardens) that had a beneficial effect on mental health throughout the lockdown (Ribeiro et al., 2021). One study discovered that active interaction with indoor plants can help to alleviate physiological and psychological stress (subjects mentioned feeling more at ease and soothed) compared to mental or computer activity (Lee et al., 2015). After these links, the mechanisms underlying them may be explained by the SRT. Consistent with the\nhttp://ijlter.org/index.php/ijlter\nSRT, exposure to nature can help minimize physiological responses to stress (Ulrich, 1983). Studies have shown that being in natural areas has higher restorative effects than being in more synthetically created outdoor or indoor situations, proving the stress-recovery idea (Yusli et al., 2021). Visitors to natural habitats, as opposed to those who visited a more developed outdoor setting or an indoor sports facility, experienced a substantial reduction in both psychological and physical stress levels following their visit, according to experimental research by Ewert and Chang (2018). This finding confirmed that nature connectivity is a critical factor to consider when developing healthier education professionals. Promoting teachers' well-being is critical for their sustainability and productivity, as well as for preventing burnout associated with remote teaching during a time of global crisis caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.\nOur data established that there is no correlation between spirituality and teacher burnout, and they indicate that spirituality is unrelated to the mental difficulties and stress experienced by instructors during Covid-19. This outcome was contradictory to prior empirical research examining spirituality as a resource in the JD-R model for burnout development (Bickerton et al., 2014a). This may be related to differences among the samples as Bickerton et al. (2014a, 2014b) examined a sample of religious employees. This might also be due to teachers' and religious staff's differing attitudes and worldviews. Akhondi et al. (2017) also discovered that teachers' feelings of purpose at work and unity between work and life varied from that of other employees.\nSpirituality acted as a mediator between connectivity to nature and teacher burnout, according to empirical studies. This suggests that even at the highest levels of spirituality, schoolteachers who were more connected to nature were less likely to experience job burnout. The findings of this study corroborate prior studies demonstrating beneficial associations between contact with nature and psychological well-being, as well as between spirituality and psychological wellbeing (Kamitsis & Francis, 2013). These findings suggest that a teacher's spiritual orientation can include a strong connection to nature. According to recent research (Y\u0131ld\u0131r\u0131m et al., 2020), a more developed spiritual orientation mitigates the detrimental effects of coronavirus stress. Furthermore, these results offer some empirical support for an underlying theoretical premise of ecopsychology theory, namely, that the human-nature interaction is rooted in a sort of engaged spirituality (e.g., Kamitsis & Francis, 2013). While this may be explained by exposure to nature, Kaplan (1995) believes that both exposures to nature and meditation must be tailored to the individual's inclinations, motivations, and talents. He argues that the untrained meditator, who frequently engages in effortful meditation, will have an easier time accessing soft fascination in a restorative atmosphere (Kaplan, 1995).\nFinally, gender appears to play a mitigating influence in the relationship between connectivity to nature and teacher burnout. This shows that, for female schoolteachers, nature may be a relatively inexpensive and widely accessible technique for reducing job burnout and preventing the development of poor mental health. Our findings contradict a recent study that revealed that while designed green spaces reduced men's burnout by a statistically significant amount, women's burnout did not decrease in a statistically significant way.\nhttp://ijlter.org/index.php/ijlter\nHowever, it was confirmed that both men and women had decreases in burnout (Yu et al., 2020). Thus, the current study emphasises the critical importance of gender disparities in teacher burnout research."

In practice, the findings suggest the promotion of nature and spirituality as a strategy of preventing burnout in teachers during the COVID-19 epidemic."

            "text": "This study comes with several limitations, among them, a relatively small sample size, a self-reported data gathering process, as well as a cross-sectional framework. It is advised that other studies consider larger sample sizes, adopt the longitudinal approach, and integrate more data collection approaches such as observations and face-to-face interviews. Owing to the different sample sizes between the males and females in this study, gender variance analysis for the suggested model was unachievable. It is advised that future studies conduct a gender variance analysis on the proposed model, taking into consideration approximately equal sample sizes for males and females. This study relied on selfreporting, and individuals may overstate their responses to self-report questionnaires for socially desirable reasons. It is reasonable to believe that an interview with each participant would have enabled us to eliminate the aforementioned restriction. Despite these limitations, it should be highlighted that the study used a non-clinical sample and that our findings will be beneficial for schoolteachers who are at risk of burnout. Future research may aim to replicate the current findings in a clinical sample (e.g., schoolteachers with a clinical burnout diagnosis)."

            "text": "Despite these limitations, we have made a substantial contribution to practice and research with this study by looking at nature connectedness, teachers' burnout, and the impact of spirituality, all of which have received little previous attention. Based on the findings, it is critical to consider both the individual's relationship to nature and spiritual practice when treating teacher burnout. To date, numerous organizations have employed nature-based initiatives to promote employees' mental health (e.g., Gritzka et al., 2020). However, due to the outbreak, such direct physical access to nature is currently impractical. As a result, additional solutions are required, particularly those that may be applied to schoolteachers, who are more likely to work remotely and live in confined homes with limited access to natural areas as a result of the pandemic. This study demonstrates that exposure to the outdoors, even through windows, may improve the working life of schoolteachers during the Covid-19 pandemic. According to prior research, increasing the amount of greenery on building grounds and upgrading the\nhttp://ijlter.org/index.php/ijlter\nstructure of windows benefits staff wellness (Dzhambov et al., 2021). Providing better views of greenery to confined schoolteachers may help prevent burnout and its associated repercussions. Furthermore, certain additional techniques may be considered. For example, one initiative is utilising virtual reality technology to convey the spiritual advantages of outdoor exposure, which could be beneficial for healthcare and educational systems. Levi and Kocher (1999) stressed the need of using virtual nature to enliven spiritual experiences and foster human growth."
