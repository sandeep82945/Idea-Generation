A new approach is developed for two-dimensional plane-stress and plane-strain systems whereby elastic strain can be reconstructed from its Longitudinal Ray Transform (LRT) as two parts of a Helmholtz decomposition based on the concept of an Airy stress potential. The solenoidal component of this decomposition is reconstructed using an inversion formula based on a tensor filtered back projection algorithm whereas the potential part can be recovered using either Hooke\u2019s law or a finite element model of the elastic system. The technique is demonstrated for two-dimensional plane-stress systems in both simulation, and on real experimental data. We also demonstrate that application of the standard scalar filtered back projection algorithm to the LRT in these systems recovers the trace of the solenoidal component of strain and we provide physical meaning for this quantity in the case of 2D plane-stress and plane-strain systems.",

            "text": "Elastic strain imaging via energy-resolved neutron transmission measurement and Bragg-edge analysis forms a natural tensor-tomography problem aimed at reconstructing the full triaxial elastic strain field within a sample from a set of lower-dimensional strain images. This problem has been studied for more than a decade, with various experimental demonstrations on special cases (e.g. axisymmetric systems and in situ applied loads) (e.g. [1, 2, 3]), and, more recently, solutions for general systems using Bayesian and least-squares techniques constrained by equilibrium (e.g. [4, 5]).\nWith reference to Figure 1, strain images of this type refer to projections of the average of elastic strain, \u03f5, along straight-line ray paths through a sample \u2126 of the form\n1\nL \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e \u03f5ij(x0 + s\u03be)\u03bei\u03bejds, (1)\nwhere L is the path-length associated with a ray passing through the point x0 \u2208 \u2126, travelling in the direction \u03be, and, as in the rest of the paper, we use the summation convention for repeated indices. For convenience, strain outside of the boundary of the sample is assigned a value of zero. From many measurements of this form, we wish to reconstruct the original strain field.\nBragg-edge strain measurements are naturally related to the Longitudinal Ray Transform (LRT), I, which can be written for suitable f \u2208 L2(Sm;Rn) as\nIf(x0, \u03be) = \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e fi1i2...im(x0 + s\u03be)\u03bei1\u03bei2 ...\u03beimds, (2)\nwith the extension to all of L2(Sm;Rn) achieved in the usual way (see below for definitions and notation).\nUnfortunately, the LRT has a large null space that creates a well-known issue with direct tomographic reconstruction of strain from Bragg-edge imaging and LRT measurements in general [6]. For f \u2208 L2(Sm;Rn), this null space consists of potential fields of the form du for any u that vanishes at infinity.\nThe structure of this null space, particularly in the case of bounded support, is important for reconstruction. In this context, we will explore the mechanics of linear elastic systems, and tensor decompositions and inversion formulas related to the LRT. Before we do this, we will begin by introducing notations used throughout the paper."

Given a vector v \u2208 R2, we write v\u22a5 for the anticlockwise rotation of v by 90 degrees. If v = (v1, v2), v\n\u22a5 = (\u2212v2, v1). For function spaces we use:\nL2(Sm; \u2126) \u2013 The space of square-integrable m-rank symetric tensor fields on \u2126. We will also use L2(\u2126) = L2(S0; \u2126) for square-integrable scalar fields;\nHk(Sm; \u2126) \u2013 The Sobolev space of square-integrable m-rank symetric tensor fields on \u2126 whose weak derivatives up to order k are also squareintegrable. For scalar fields we use Hk(\u2126) = Hk(S0; \u2126);\nC\u221e(Sm; \u2126) \u2013 The space of smooth m-rank symetric tensor fields on \u2126 with continuous derivatives of all orders;\nC\u221ec (Sm; \u2126) \u2013 The subspace of C\u221e(Sm; \u2126) comprising fields with compact support;\nHk0 (Sm; \u2126) \u2013 The closure of C\u221ec (Sm; \u2126) in Hk(Sm; \u2126).\nWe also use the following differential operators:\nd \u2013 Symmetric gradient operator. For f \u2208 C\u221e(Sm;Rn), df \u2208 C\u221e(Sm+1;Rn) will be the symmetric derivative defined in [7]. This coincides with the gradient when m = 0 and for u \u2208 C\u221e(S1;Rn)\n(du)ij = 1\n2 ( \u2202ui \u2202xj + \u2202uj \u2202xi ) ,\nor equivalently du = 1 2\n( \u2207 \u2297 u + (\u2207 \u2297 u)T ) , where \u2297 refers to dyadic\nproduct and (\u00b7)T refers to the transpose operation;\nd\u22a5 \u2013 Perpendicular symmetric gradient operator. Note this operator is only defined in dimension n = 2. For f \u2208 C\u221e(Sm;R2), d\u22a5f \u2208 C\u221e(Sm+1;R2) is the symmetrisation of the perpendicular gradient of the components of f introduced in [8].\nFor \u03c8 \u2208 C\u221e(R2) this is given by\n(d\u22a5\u03c8)i = \u2202\u03c8\n\u2202xj eji3\nand for u \u2208 C\u221e(S1,R2)\n(d\u22a5u)ij = 1\n2 ( \u2202ui \u2202xk ekj3 + \u2202uj \u2202xk eki3 ) ,\nwhere eijk is the usual Levi-Civita permutation symbol. Equivalently d\u22a5\u03c8 = \u2207\u22a5\u03c8 and d\u22a5u = 1\n2\n( \u2207\u22a5 \u2297 u+ (\u2207\u22a5 \u2297 u)T ) ;\nDiv \u2013 The divergence operator which is the formal adjoint of \u2212d and maps C\u221e(Sm+1;Rn) \u2192 C\u221e(Sm;Rn). This is the contraction of the gradient of a tensor field and for the general formula see [7]. For u \u2208 C\u221e(S1,Rn), Div(u) is the standard divergence of u;\nDiv\u22a5 \u2013 The perpendicular divergence which is the formal adjoint of \u2212d\u22a5 and maps C\u221e(Sm+1;R2) \u2192 C\u221e(Sm;R2). This is the same as the operator \u03b4\u22a5 in [8].\nWe additionally say that a tensor field is divergence-free if its divergence is zero. The differential operators are initially defined on smooth tensor fields, but can be extended to fields with distributional coefficients, and in particular for k \u2265 1 provide continuous operators d, d\u22a5 : Hk(Sm;R2) \u2192 Hk\u22121(Sm+1;R2) while Div, Div\u22a5 : Hk(Sm+1;R2) \u2192 Hk\u22121(Sm;R2).\nWe will mostly be concerned with tensors of rank either m = 1 or 2 and use the standard notations f : g for contraction of 2-rank tensors and f \u00b7 g for multiplication of a 2-rank tensor with a 1-rank tensor, or the dot product of 1-rank tensors.\nWe now return to the topic and begin with a review of Helmholtz decomposition and inversion of the LRT, both in general, and in the context of elastic strain in R2."

In practical terms, \u00b5m is related to the adjoint of the X-ray transform1 (i.e. scalar back-projection), R\u2217, acting component-wise with back-projections weighted by the diadic product of \u03be with itself m-times;\n\u00b5mi1i2...im = 1 2\u03c0n/2 \u0393 ( n 2 ) R\u2217\u03bei1\u03bei2 ...\u03beim . (5)\nNote that the constant factor is present because of the normalisation of the measure on Sn\u22121 in [7].\n1Equivalent to the Radon transform in 2D.\nInversion formula (4) recovers sf which is defined on Rn and in general has unbounded support. However, we are interested in reconstruction and solenoidal decomposition on a bounded domain. Indeed, let \u2126 \u2282 Rn be a bounded domain with Lipschitz boundary and outward surface normal n on \u2202\u2126. Similar to (3), there is a unique decomposition of f \u2208 L2(Sm;Rn), m \u2265 1, restricted to this set of the form\nf = du\u2126 + sf\u2126 + dh\u2126 on \u2126, (6)\nwhere u\u2126 \u2208 H10 (Sm\u22121; \u2126), h\u2126 \u2208 H1(Sm\u22121; \u2126), known as the \u2018harmonic part\u2019, satisfies\nDiv(dh\u2126) = 0 on \u2126,\nand sf\u2126 \u2208 L2(Sm; \u2126) satisfies the weak equation\u222b \u2126 (sf\u2126)i1 ... im \u2202\u03c6i1 ... im\u22121 \u2202xim dx = 0 \u2200\u03c6 \u2208 H1(Sm\u22121; \u2126). (7)\nFor suitable sf\u2126, this is equivalent to sf\u2126 being divergence-free on \u2126 and (sf\u2126)i1 ... imnim |\u2202\u2126 = 0. Also, it is clear from (7) that, in this case, sf\u2126 extended by zero to Rn is divergence-free. A key point for our result is that, for fields where the boundary trace makes sense, this extension by zero is only divergence-free when the boundary condition (sf\u2126)i1 ... imnim |\u2202\u2126 = 0 holds. For an in depth discussion of weak formulation of the Helmholtz decomposition in the case of L2 vector fields, see [10].\nWhen the harmonic part vanishes, the solenoidal decomposition on \u2126 is related to the one on Rn as in the following lemma.\nLemma 1. Suppose that \u2126 contains the support of f . If h\u2126 in (6) is zero, then sf and u in (3) are equal to the extension by zero of sf\u2126 and u\u2126 to Rn. Conversely, if sf and u in (3) are supported in \u2126, then h\u2126 = 0.\nProof. Assume that decomposition (6) holds with h\u2126 = 0 and extend u\u2126 and sf\u2126 to u and\nsf on Rn by setting them equal to zero outside of \u2126. By (7), sf is then divergence-free on Rn. Since u\u2126 \u2208 H10 (Sm\u22121; \u2126) we also have, from the weak formulation, that u \u2208 H1(Sm\u22121;Rn) and du is du\u2126 extended by zero. Thus, by uniqueness of the decomposition, (6) implies (3) in this case.\nConversely, suppose that sf and u in (3) are supported in \u2126 and define u\u2126 and sf\u2126 by restricting to \u2126. Then, since u \u2208 H1(S1;Rn) with support contained in \u2126, its restriction u\u2126 is in H 1 0 (S1; \u2126). Additionally, we can see that\n(7) holds because the same must hold for sf on Rn for any \u03c6 \u2208 H1(Sm\u22121;Rn). By uniqueness of the decomposition we then see that (6) holds with h\u2126 = 0 on \u2126 as claimed.\nFor 2D elastic strain \u03f5 \u2208 L2(S2;R2), (4) simplifies to\ns\u03f5 = 1\n2\u03c0 (\u2212\u2206)1/2\n[ c0 + c1(I\u2212\u2206\u22121d2)tr ] I\u2217I\u03f5, (8)\nwhere c0 = 3/4, c1 = \u22121/4, tr is the trace operator, I is the 2-rank identity and I\u2217 = R\u2217\u03be \u2297 \u03be. In comparison, Derevtsov and Svetov [8] and Louis [9] consider the case when \u2126 is the unit ball in R2, implicitly assuming that the hamonic part of the field is equal to zero so that s\u03f5 = s\u03f5\u2126. In this context, [9] provides a much simpler inversion formula of the form\ns\u03f5 = 1\n4\u03c0 (\u2212\u2206)1/2I\u2217I\u03f5, (9)\nwhile Derevtsov and Svetov [8] provide the same formula (9) but, due to a typographical error, multiplied by a factor of 2 on the right side. We should expect that (8) and (9) are the same formula and, by Lemma 1, when the harmonic part h\u2126 of \u03f5 is zero they both equal zero outside of \u2126. As we will see, when \u03f5 is the strain field arising from a stress tensor satisfying equilibrium for a homogeneous and isotropic elastic medium with no boundary traction, this will always be the case.\nWe now show that (8) and (9) are indeed equivalent, extending (9) to a new setting.\nLemma 2. For m = n = 2, formulas (8) and (9) are equivalent.\nProof. Taking the component-wise Fourier transform with spatial frequency vector \u03ba, (8) can be written\ns\u03f5\u0302 = 1\n2\u03c0 |\u03ba|\n[ c0 + c1 ( I\u2212 \u03ba\u03ba T |\u03ba|2 ) tr ] g\u0302, (10)\nwhere g = I\u2217I\u03f5. Since s\u03f5 is solenoidal s\u03f5\u0302\u03ba = 0 and we can write s\u03f5\u0302 = \u03b1\u03ba\u22a5(\u03ba\u22a5)T for some \u03b1 \u2208 L2(R2). Hence (10) becomes\n\u03b1\u03ba\u22a5(\u03ba\u22a5)T = 1\n2\u03c0 |\u03ba|\n[ c0 + c1 ( I\u2212 \u03ba\u03ba T |\u03ba|2 ) tr ] g\u0302.\nMultiplying by \u03ba\u22a5(\u03ba\u22a5)T and rearranging;\n\u03b1\u03ba\u22a5(\u03ba\u22a5)T |\u03ba|2 = s\u03f5\u0302|\u03ba|2 = 1 2\u03c0 \u03ba\u22a5(\u03ba\u22a5)T |\u03ba|\n[ c0 + c1 ( I\u2212 \u03ba\u03ba T |\u03ba|2 ) tr ] g\u0302\nwhich provides\ns\u03f5\u0302 = 1\n2\u03c0\n\u03ba\u22a5(\u03ba\u22a5)T\n|\u03ba|\n[ c0 + c1Itr ] g\u0302.\nNow g is also solenoidal and hence can also be written g\u0302 = \u03b2\u03ba\u22a5(\u03ba\u22a5)T for some \u03b2 \u2208 L2(R2);\ns\u03f5\u0302 = 1\n2\u03c0\n\u03ba\u22a5(\u03ba\u22a5)T\n|\u03ba|\n[ c0\u03ba \u22a5(\u03ba\u22a5)T + c1I|\u03ba|2 ] \u03b2\n= 1\n2\u03c0 c0|\u03ba|\u03b2\u03ba\u22a5(\u03ba\u22a5)T +\n1\n2\u03c0 c1|\u03ba|\u03b2\u03ba\u22a5(\u03ba\u22a5)T\n= 1\n2\u03c0 |\u03ba|(c0 + c1)g\u0302.\nIn the spatial domain this implies:\ns\u03f5 = 1\n2\u03c0 (\u2212\u2206)1/2(c0 + c1)I\u2217I\u03f5\n= 1\n4\u03c0 (\u2212\u2206)1/2I\u2217I\u03f5,\nwhich is identical to (9).\nGiven Lemma 2, we use only (9) which provides a component-wise approach to reconstruction of the solenoidal component of strain of the form\ns\u03f5 = 1\n4\u03c0 R\u2217\u039b\u03be \u2297 \u03beI\u03f5, (11)\nwhere \u039b is the Ram-Lak filter (or similar) used in standard scalar Filtered Back Projection (FBP). This inversion formula applies over all of R2, however our primary concern is finite samples; i.e. strain fields with support contained within some bounded set \u2126 \u2282 R2. Regardless, numerical computation can generally only occur over a bounded domain. Because of this, it is important to know when the harmonic component of the strain vanishes over the computational domain if we are to apply (11); in general the components of the Helmholtz decomposition (3) do not have bounded support even if f does. Before we address this, we first provide a brief review of the mechanics of stress and strain on the plane in the context of this work."

On a multiply connected domain with k holes, n(n + 1)k/2 additional integral constraints are required along with W (f) = 0 to imply f = du (see [13, Proposition 2.8]).\nThe final ingredient is to specify boundary conditions experienced by the sample.

Given that the stress \u03c3 satisfies (13) in the classical sense (i.e. is twice differentiable) on \u2126 and satisfies the traction-free boundary condition (15), in fact \u03c3 extended as zero outside of \u2126 is divergence free in the distributional sense and is therefore its own solenoidal part with no potential part if decomposed\naccording to (3). Our goal in this section is to use this fact, together with (17) or (18) to find the solenoidal decomposition of \u03f5. The issue is that the Airy stress potential \u03c8 appearing in (16) may not satisfy the same equation distributionally when extended as zero to R2. The next lemma shows that when the traction-free boundary condition (15) is satisfied, in fact there is an Airy stress potential which extends as zero.\nLemma 3. Suppose that \u03c3 \u2208 L2(Sm;R2) has support contained in a bounded and simply connected set \u2126 and satisfies (13) in the distributional sense on R2. Then there exists unique \u03c8 \u2208 H2(R2) such that supp(\u03c8) \u2282 \u2126 and\n\u03c3 = (d\u22a5)2\u03c8 on R2.

First consider the case when \u03c3 \u2208 C\u221ec (Sm;R2) satisfies (13) and has support contained in \u2126 which is itself inside an open ball BR of radius R centred at the origin. The two columns of \u03c3, \u03c3i1 and \u03c3i2, are divergence free vector fields on R2 and so the path integrals of eik3\u03c3ijdxk between any two points are independent of path due to Green\u2019s theorem. For x0 \u2208 \u2202BR and any x \u2208 R2, we define new functions via the path integrals\n\u03d5j(x) = \u222b x x0 eik3\u03c3ijdxk (21)\nin which the path is left unspecified. Defining the vector field \u03d5 = (\u03d51, \u03d52) it follows, due to path independence and the fundamental theorem of calculus, that\n\u2202\u03d5j \u2202xk = eik3\u03c3ij. (22)\nAdditionally, since \u2126 is simply connected, for any x \u2208 R2 \\ \u2126 we can choose a path from x0 to x outside of \u2126 and by its path integral definition (21), we have \u03d5(x) = 0. Thus, we conclude that \u03d5 is also supported in \u2126.\nNext, from (22) we obtain\n\u2202\u03d51 \u2202x1 + \u2202\u03d52 \u2202x2 = Div(\u03d5) = 0.\nThis implies as before that line integrals of eik3\u03d5i dxk between two points are independent of path, and we define\n\u03c8(x) = \u222b x x0 ejl3\u03d5j dxl.\nAlso as before, this implies that \u03c8 is supported in \u2126 and\n\u2202\u03c8 \u2202xl = ejl3\u03d5j.\nPutting together the previous construction and using path independence we see that \u03c8 is directly related to \u03c3 by the formula\n\u03c8(x1, x2) = \u222b\u222b {s<x1, t>x2} \u03c312(s, t) ds dt.\nSince the support \u03c3 is bounded we can restrict the area of integration in the previous integrals to bounded rectangles, and then use the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality to prove (20) where the constant M depends only on the size of \u2126.\nWe have now proved the lemma for the case when \u03c3 is smooth. For \u03c3 \u2208 L2(Sm;R2) we approximate by a sequence \u03c3j \u2208 C\u221ec (Sm;R2) of divergence free fields such that \u03c3j \u2192 \u03c3 in L2(Sm;R2) and each \u03c3j is supported within 2\u2212j of \u2126. By (20) the corresponding potentials \u03c8j also converge in H\n2(R2) to a function \u03c8 and by continuity of the derivatives from H2 to L2 we see that (19) also holds. The supports of the potentials will also shrink to \u2126 and so we see that the support of \u03c8 is contained in \u2126.\nFinally, note that from (19) the potential \u03c8 \u2208 H2(R2) satisfies the biharmonic equation\n\u22062\u03c8 = (Div\u22a5)2\u03c3.\nThis equation has a unique solution in H2(R2) and so the proof is complete.\nFrom Lemma 3, we can conclude the following: If a two dimensional residual elastic strain field on the bounded domain \u2126 experiences no boundary traction, its extension by zero to all of R2 has a unique Helmholtz decomposition of the form\n\u03f5 = d\u03c9 + s\u03f5 (23)\nwhere s\u03f5 and d\u03c9 are compactly supported within the complement of the unbounded component of the complement of \u2126 (when \u2126 is simply connected this is equal to \u2126). By uniqueness and comparison to (17) and (18), this decomposition can be written in terms of the Airy stress potential as\n\u03c9 = \u2212 \u03bd E d\u03c8 (24) s\u03f5 = 1\nE (d\u22a5)2\u03c8, (25)\nfor plane-stress, or\n\u03c9 = \u2212\u03bd(1 + \u03bd) E d\u03c8 (26) s\u03f5 = 1\u2212 \u03bd2\nE (d\u22a5)2\u03c8, (27)\nin the case of plane-strain. Note that in each case s\u03f5 is proportional to \u03c3. From a reconstructed solenoidal component, we would like to recover the full elastic strain tensor over a sample. Before we approach this task, we provide a brief comment on recent experimental work in this area."

This assumption is plainly false in almost all cases; the only hydrostatic stress field (and hence strain field) that satisfies equilibrium is constant for all x. However, the assumption does allow for a direct means of reconstruction by standard scalar FBP since I\u03f5 = R\u03f5\u0304 for this case.\nFor example, in Busi et al [14] the authors perform a slice-by-slice FBP to recover an assumed isotropic strain within an additively manufactured stainless steel cube from a set of 19 Bragg-edge strain images. Similarly, Zhu et al [15] recover an assumed scalar isotropic strain in a laser welded steel sample using a similar technique.\nClearly the assumption of isotropic strain was invalid in both cases, however the question remains: What has been recovered? How does the scalar FBP of the LRT relate to the strain field within the sample?\nTo answer this question, we examine the trace of the solenoidal component of elastic strain in (11) to obtain the following (note that |\u03be| = 1);\ns\u03f5kk = 1\n4\u03c0 R\u2217\u03bek\u03bek\u039bI\u03f5\n= 1\n4\u03c0 R\u2217\u039bI\u03f5\nHence the recovered scalar field stemming from an isotropic assumption is precisely the trace of the (in-plane) solenoidal component, and in general there are no further conclusions that can be made.\nHowever, if the strain field is inherently two-dimensional, we can extend this result by considering stress in terms of the Airy potential.

The three unique components of this strain field are shown in Figure 2a.\nThe second and third corresponded to finite element simulations of physical samples that were the focus of prior experimental work [4]. All relevant details can be found in the reference, however a brief description of each sample is as follows;\n1. Crushed Ring : A sample formed by plastically deforming an initially stress-free steel ring along its diameter. The geometry of the sample and applied deformation is shown in Figure 3a. The residual strain field in this sample originates from a distributed eigen-strain related to plastic deformation (see Figure 4a)\n2. Offset Ring-and-Plug : A cylindrical steel sample constructed by shrinkfitting an oversize cylindrical \u2018plug\u2019 into an undersize hole that is offset from the centreline (see Figure 3b). The strain field within this sample originates from the interference between the offset ring and the plug (see Figure 5a). In the context of (12), the interference imposes a discrete eigen-strain with localised support on the interface.\nBoth samples were 14mm thick and were simulated as steel with E = 209GPa, \u03bd = 0.34 and a yield stress of 650MPa. The finite element model for the first sample required a non-linear solve based on an elasto-plastic material model, while the second sample was modelled using linear-elasticity. Both models were built and solved in the software package PTC/Creo.\nAll three strain fields were represented as three scalar components mapped to regular two-dimensional grids. The size and resolutions of these grids were\nas follows: Airy \u2013 400\u00d7 400, spacing 0.006, Crushed Ring \u2013 500\u00d7 500, spacing 48\u00b5m, Ring and Plug \u2013 521\u00d7 521, spacing 50\u00b5m. In each case, all three strain components were extended by zero outside the sample boundaries.\nWhat follows is a demonstration of the reconstruction of these fields from synthetic LRT data."

Forward map the LRT of the strain field by successive application of the \u2018radon\u2019 Matlab function for each individual projection angle. i.e. for a given projection angle \u03b8:\nI\u03f5(s, \u03b8) = R[cos2 \u03b8\u03f511 + 2 cos \u03b8 sin \u03b8\u03f512 + sin2 \u03b8\u03f522]\n2. Component-wise back-project the resulting strain-sinogram to compute the three unique components of s\u03f5 using the FBP algorithm as implemented in the \u2018iradon\u2019 intrinsic Matlab function (as per (9)).\n3. Calculate a first reconstruction of \u03f5 from s\u03f5 based on Hooke\u2019s law using (38), (39) and (40).\n4. Calculate derivatives of s\u03f5 by first transforming the individual components to the Fourier domain using the \u2018fft2\u2019 and \u2018fftshift\u2019 intrinsic\nMatlab functions. These transformed components are then multiplied by appropriate \u03ba-space filters corresponding to \u2202/\u2202x1 and \u2202/\u2202x2 before transforming back to the real domain using \u2018fftshift\u2019 and \u2018ifft2\u2019\n5. From these derivatives, calculate the two components of the vector b using (36) and (37).\n6. Using the Matlab PDE solver, calculate a finite element solution for the displacement field \u03c9 satisfying (34) and (35) subject to the calculated vector field b.\n7. Calculate a second reconstruction for \u03f5 as the sum \u03f5 = s\u03f5+d\u03c9, where d\u03c9 is computed from the shape functions within the finite element solution.\nThe target element size for the finite element model in step 6 was set to be 0.5% of the maximum sample dimensions.

However, the reconstruction based on Hooke\u2019s law was slightly more accurate in terms of a root-mean-square error.\nFigures 2, 4 and 5 show the results of this process based on simulated LRT data from 200 equally spaced angular projections over 360\u25e6. Each figure shows the original strain field together with the reconstructed solenoidal\ncomponent, the recovered potential component, and the final reconstruction based on the sum of the two.\nIt was also interesting to note that, in each case, the reconstructed solenoidal component was approximately zero outside the sample boundary (as expected from Lemma 3). This is examined further in Section 8.5 below.\nThe difference between the reconstructions and the original field was small; typically around 1-5% of the maximum value of the original components. However, it was observed that this did not significantly decrease along with the number of projections. The source of this persistent discrepancy was discretisation error related to minor deviations from the equilibrium relation introduced by various interpolations onto the regular grid. This is examined further in the following section.\nFigure 6 shows the computed Saint-Venant incompatibility of the recon-\nstructed solenoid compared to the original for all three fields. These images were calculated using a similar transform-filter-transform approach in the Fourier domain.\nThe Airy stress field shows incompatibility distributed over the sample domain, whereas the other two samples show more localised support. In the case of the crushed-ring, this is likely to have originated from localised plastic shear within the elasto-plastic finite element model, while the offset ring-and-plug indicates a clear dipole around the circumference of the plug corresponding to the interference.\nAs expected, the incompatibility of the reconstructed solenoidal components are identical to that of the original fields within a small amount of numerical noise."

In this respect both approaches were found to be quite stable and converged to the original field with an increasing number of projections (notwithstanding the dicretisation error identified earlier).\nAlthough not strictly necessary, slight improvement was found by limiting the order of terms in the numerical derivatives used to compute b. This was achieved by cutting-off the \u03ba-space filters for frequencies above a certain threshold. A cut-off frequency equal to 0.7 times the maximum magnitude provided a good compromise between noise and fidelity.\nFor the Airy stress field, Figure 7 shows the convergence of the reconstructed fields along with the number of projections in the presence of Gaussian random noise with a standard deviation of 10% of the maximum LRT value. Results from three systems are shown corresponding to different spatial resolutions (i.e. grid size). In each case, convergence of the relative error to zero is observed to occur at O(n\u22121/2) until the lower limit corresponding to the discretisation error is reached.\nGenerally speaking, the reconstruction based on Hooke\u2019s law had a lower persistent error and the size of the persistent error was observed to be directly related to the resolution of the grid.\nIt should be noted that, in the presence of noise the calculation of the Saint-Venant operator was found to be inherently unstable regardless of any reasonable cut-off frequency used in the relevant filters."

(46)\nA simulated reconstruction based on 1000 equally spaced LRT projections from a 400 \u00d7 400 Cartesian grid is shown in Figure 8b. As expected, the reconstructed strain matches the original field accurately and the support of the reconstruction is contained within the boundary of the sample. Outside of the boundary, the reconstructed solenoidal component was around three orders-of-magnitude smaller than the original field.\nFigure 8c shows the residual between the LRT of the original field and the reconstruction.\nFigure 8d shows the same field with the addition of a constant hydrostatic strain of magnitude \u03f5\u0304 = 0.2. Like the original field, this altered version sat-\nisfies equilibrium at all points within the sample, however it clearly violates the traction-free boundary condition since |\u03c3 \u00b7 n| = 0.2 on \u2202\u2126.\nAn attempted reconstruction of this field based on the same process is shown in Figure 8e. A visual inspection of the result clearly indicates the reconstruction has failed to reproduce the original field.\nIt is also interesting to note that the reconstructed field is far from zero outside the boundary of the sample. This observation, together with Lemma 1 suggests that the apparent support of s\u03f5 reconstructed from data gives a reliable indicator of the existence of a harmonic potential component, and hence the appropriateness of the traction-free assumption for a given experimental system.\nIt is also clear that the LRT of the reconstructed solenoid does not match that of the original field. Figure 8f shows the difference between these two sinograms computed with s\u03f5 masked to zero outside the boundary. The residual is of a significant magnitude and appears to correspond directly to the added hydrostatic/harmonic component. This poses an interesting question: Given the harmonic component is compatible, can it be recovered through reconstruction of a non-zero boundary condition similar to the process carried out by Wensrich et al [1]? This question will form the focus of future work in this area."

The outcome of this experiment was measured strain-sinograms from the crushed-ring and offset ring-and-plug samples corresponding to a set of 50 golden-angle projections. As per (1), these measurements correspond to average strain along ray-paths, which require multiplication by appropriate values of L to compute the LRT (see Figure 9a and 9b).\nFigure 9d and 9f show the results of the reconstruction based on Hooke\u2019s law compared to traditional neutron diffraction based strain measurements from the KOWARI engineering diffractometer at the Australian Centre for Neutron Scattering within the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation [19]. This reference data (Figure 9c and 9e) is in the form of\ninterpolated/inferred fields computed from scattered measurements using a technique that guarantees equilibrium is satisfied at each point [18].\nOverall the reconstruction has performed well in terms of overall mag-\nnitude and distribution within the limits of resolution.

Using a tensorial version of standard FBP, a solenoidal (divergence free) component of the strain field can be recovered, which can then be used to recover the original field through the application of Hooke\u2019s law or a process involving the numerical solution of a standard elasticity problem. In simulation, both approaches were found to be robust to measurement noise. Both approaches also performed well on real experimental data.\nFrom this perspective it was also possible to identify the result of standard scalar FBP when applied to LRT measurement as the trace of the solenoidal component. In some situations (e.g. plane-stress or plane-strain) this can be related to the trace of the stress tensor, however in general, more information is required to bring meaning to such a reconstruction in a three-dimensional system."
