    "abstractText": "Pancreatic cancer (PC) is one of the most aggressive solid malignancies with poor treatment response and low survival rates. Herbal medicines such as betulinic acid (BA) have shown potential in treating various solid tumours, but with limitations that can be circumvented by polymer-drug conjugation. Polyethylene glycol-BA (PEG-BA) polymer-drug conjugate has previously shown selective anticancer activity against PC cells. Here, we elucidate the mechanism of cell death and the cell death pathway, anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities of PEG-BA. PEG-BA induced apoptotic cell death by arresting MIA-PaCa-2 cells in the Sub-G1 phase of the cell cycle compared with BA and untreated cells (39.50 \u00b1 5.32% > 19.63 \u00b1 4.49% > 4.57 \u00b1 0.82%). NF\u03baB/p65 protein expression was moderately increased by PEG-BA (2.70 vs. 3.09 \u00b1 0.42 ng/mL; p = 0.1521). However, significant (p < 0.05) overexpression of the proapoptotic genes TNF (23.72 \u00b1 1.03) and CASPASE 3 (12,059.98 \u00b1 1.74) compared with untreated cells was notable. The antioxidant potential of PEG-BA was greater (IC50 = 15.59 \u00b1 0.64 \u03bcM) compared with ascorbic acid (25.58 \u00b1 0.44 \u03bcM) and BA-only (>100 \u03bcM) and further confirmed with the improved reduction of hydroperoxide levels compared with BA-only (518.80 \u00b1 25.53 \u03bcM vs. 542.43 \u00b1 9.70 \u03bcM). In conclusion, PEG-BA activated both the intrinsic and extrinsic pathways of apoptosis and improved antioxidant activities in PC cells, suggesting enhanced anticancer activity upon conjugation.",

            "text": "Pancreatic cancer (PC) is a lethal solid malignancy with increasing incidence and mortality worldwide [1]. Most patients present with advanced stages of the disease, in which case the tumour is inoperable and has metastasised to other sites or both [2]. Currently, the best curative option is surgery using adjuvant chemotherapy, with only 15% of patients presenting with resectable or early-stage disease [2]. Combination chemotherapy regimens, including gemcitabine and FOLFIRINOX (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, fluorouracil and leucovorin), are used as the first-line therapy for PC and have shown improved patient survival [3]. Although survival has improved, this is still insufficient as the survival rate is still abysmal compared with other cancers. Furthermore, studies have demonstrated that the administration of chemotherapy could lead to adverse side effects suggesting the need to develop potent drugs against PC but with reduced side effects, including toxicity to normal cells [4]. Betulinic acid (3\u03b2-hydroxy-lup-20(29)-en-28-oic acid), the carboxylic acid derivative of betulin, is a naturally occurring, widely distributed pentacyclic triterpene sourced from the outer bark of the Betula alba tree [5]. Betulinic acid (BA) has shown promising anticancer\nPolymers 2023, 15, 448. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15020448 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 448 2 of 17\nefficacy against several tumours, including cervical cancer, melanomas, leukaemia, blastomas and PC [6\u20138]. However, like any other natural compound, BA is associated with several limitations, including a high molecular weight, which inhibits passage through the lipid bilayer of cells, and poor solubility, which reduces biodistribution, bioavailability and overall therapeutic index [9]. Using nanoparticles in chemotherapy provides an efficient and selective drug delivery system for targeting tumour cells [10]. An example of this type of platform is polymer-drug conjugates, macromolecular constructs covalently linked to a polymeric carrier. Drug conjugation is known to maximise efficacy, reduce adverse side effects, prolong blood circulation, passively deliver drugs to tumours via the enhanced permeability and retention (EPR) effect and overcome tumour resistance [11,12]. In a recent study from our laboratory, conjugation of polyethylene glycol (PEG) to BA showed selective toxicity to PC cells compared with BA alone, resulting in increased apoptotic cell death [8]. However, the specific mechanism of apoptotic cell death and possible evasion strategies employed by the cancer cells were not investigated. Apoptosis occurs via two different pathways, namely the extrinsic (death receptor) and intrinsic (mitochondrial) pathways [7]. The extrinsic pathway involves the formation of the death-inducing signalling complex (DISC) and subsequent activation of procaspase 8 to caspase 8 [13]. In type 1 cells, the signal from caspase 8 is strong enough to activate procaspase 3 to caspase 3 and leads to apoptosis [14,15]. In type 2 cells, the signal is weak and requires amplification via cleavage of Bid (truncated Bid), which is translocated to the mitochondria [7,15,16]. The intrinsic pathway is caused by cellular stress that disrupts the mitochondrial membrane potential, leading to leakage of cytochrome c (Cyt C) into the cytosol via the Bak/Bax channel [7,17,18]. CytC interacts with deoxyadenosine triphosphate (dATP), apoptotic proteinase-activating factor-1 (Apaf-1) and procaspase 9, forming a complex known as the apoptosome, which leads to the autoactivation of procaspase 9 to caspase 9, which in turn activates procaspase 3 to caspase 3, leading to apoptosis [13]. Cancer cells have developed mechanisms to evade apoptosis, a major hallmark of carcinogenesis [19]. One such mechanism is the dysregulation of pro- and antiapoptotic genes or proteins [20,21]. For example, the B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family, which includes both pro (including puma, Bid, Bad, Bax and Bak) and anti (such as Bcl-2, Bcl-XL and Mcl-1)-apoptotic members, are frequently dysregulated in carcinogenesis [21]. Unlike some tumours, PC is associated with the downregulation of the Bcl-2 protein [22\u201324]. This suggests that evasion of apoptosis is induced by the other antiapoptotic proteins (Bcl-XL and Mcl-1). These proteins have been associated with the nuclear factor kappa-light chain enhancer of activated B cells (NF-\u03baB), a mediator of inflammation, which is overexpressed in tumours [22]. Like other cancers, PC is known to downregulate the expression of Bax and Bak, favouring survival over cell death [22,25]. Furthermore, other studies have shown that cancer cells inhibit the activation of caspase proteins by overexpressing the inactive forms compared with the activated caspases [26\u201328]. In the case of cellular injury, the immune system is activated in an attempt to alleviate any resulting potential damage [29,30]. One of the response mechanisms used by the innate immune system is inflammation [29], with reactive oxygen species (ROS) playing a significant role. ROS are necessary for embryonic development at moderate levels, guiding tissue maintenance and immunity [31]. Consequently, chronic inflammation and subsequent overproduction of ROS can result in the induction of DNA oxidation, affecting the stability of the genome and causing gene mutations, which in turn facilitate cancer initiation [29,31\u201334]. Furthermore, inflammation aids in the formation of the tumour-promoting microenvironment and can cause chemoresistance in many cancer types, including PC [29,35]. NF-\u03baB mediates inflammation by regulating pro-inflammatory cytokines such as interleukins, transforming growth factor beta and tumour necrosis factor-alpha [29,30,36]. In addition, NF-\u03baB is continuously transcribed in PC, leading to transcriptional and translational upregulation of genes involved in angiogenesis, apoptosis inhibition, tissue invasion and growth factors, activating survival pathways [36\u201338].\nPolymers 2023, 15, 448 3 of 17\nIn this study, PEG-BA was assessed for its effect on apoptosis by measuring DNA content, proapoptotic gene expression, and NF-\u03baB protein activity on MIA PaCa-2 treated cells. Its effect on the inflammation induced by ROS was also assessed. The findings demonstrated that PEG-BA induces apoptosis by arresting cells in the sub-G1 phase of the cell cycle, activates proapoptotic genes of the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways and inhibits ROS formation. Overall, there was cell growth inhibition, apoptosis induction and ROS activity inhibition in PC cells treated with PEG-BA, suggesting that apoptosis is the primary anticancer mechanism."

Extraction of Total RNA\nTotal RNA was extracted using the E.Z.N.A.\u00ae Total RNA Kit I (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA, USA) according to the manufacturer\u2019s guidelines. Briefly, 700 \u00b5L of guanidium thiocyanate (GTC)-lysis buffer containing 2% \u03b2-mercaptoethanol was added to the pelleted cells previously treated with 4 \u00b5M BA and PEG-BA and 4.5 \u00b5M gemcitabine for 72 h. This mixture was then transferred to an RNA homogeniser mini-column and centrifuged for 60 s at 13,000\u00d7 g. This was followed by adding 700 \u00b5L of freshly prepared 70% ethanol and transferring to a HiBind\u00aeRNA mini-column. The mixture was centrifuged at 10,000\u00d7 g for 60 s until the RNA in-solution was bound to the column. The bound RNA was washed (30 s at 10,000\u00d7 g) with 500 \u00b5L of RNA Wash Buffer I. The filtrate was discarded, and the RNA was rewashed (60 s at 10,000\u00d7 g) using a second buffer (RNA Wash Buffer II containing 100% ethanol). This step was repeated once to ensure proper washing of the RNA before drying the HiBind\u00aeRNA mini-column to remove any residual ethanol (15,000\u00d7 g for 120 s). The HiBind\u00aeRNA mini-column was transferred to a 1.5 mL Eppendorf tube, and 60 \u00b5L of nuclease-free water was added, followed by centrifugation (15,000\u00d7 g for 120 s) to elute the RNA. The eluted RNA was assessed for purity, and the concentration was determined using the Nanodrop 2000 (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).\n2.7.2. Complementary DNA (cDNA) Synthesis\nTotal RNA (250 ng/\u00b5L) was used to make the cDNA template for each sample. The cDNA synthesis step was performed using the ProtoScript II First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (New England BioLabs Inc, Ipswich, MA, USA) following the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. Briefly, 20 \u00b5L of the reaction mixture was added to respective Eppendorf tubes: 2 \u00b5L of d(T)23 VN (50 \u00b5M) primers, 10 \u00b5L of the ProtoScript II reaction mix (2X), 2 \u00b5L of the Protoscript II enzyme mix (10 X) and 6 \u00b5L of the RNA template diluted with the required amount of nuclease-free water to have a uniform final cDNA concentration for all the samples of 1000 ng/\u00b5L. The samples were then incubated in a SimpliAmp Thermal Cycler (Thermo Fischer Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) under the following conditions: 42 \u25e6C for one hour, enzyme inactivation at 80 \u25e6C for 5 min, and an infinite hold at 4 \u25e6C.\n2.7.3. Quantitative Real-Time Polymerase Chain Reaction Analysis\nReal-time PCR was performed in a 96-well plate format (on ice) according to the MIQE guidelines [43]. Briefly, 5 \u00b5L of the PowerUp\u2122 SYBR\u2122 Green Master Mix (2X),\nPolymers 2023, 15, 448 5 of 17\n0.5 \u00b5L each of forward and reverse primer (sequences shown in Table 1), 2 \u00b5L of the cDNA template, and 2 \u00b5L of nuclease-free water were added to each well of a 96-well PCR plate, in duplicate. The universal PCR conditions used entailed a UDG activation at 50 \u25e6C for 2 min, Dual-lock DNA polymerase activation at 95 \u25e6C for 2 min, PCR cycling (40 cycles) of denaturation (95 \u25e6C for 15 s), annealing primer-specific temperature range of 50\u201360 \u25e6C for 15 s and extension (72 \u25e6C for 60 s). Two reference genes: \u03b2-Actin (ACTB) and mitochondrial ribosomal protein L19 (MRPL19), were used to normalise relative fold expression. Fold changes were determined using the 2\u2212\u2206\u2206CT method [44].\n1 The housekeeping genes used to normalise fold expression."

DPPH Assay\nBA, PEG-BA, and the ascorbic acid standard were tested in the antioxidant activity assay at concentrations in the range 0.78\u2013100 \u00b5M. This assay was modified from the 2014 protocol by Mistry and Shah [46]. Briefly, 180 \u00b5L of distilled water was added to the first\nPolymers 2023, 15, 448 6 of 17\nnine rows of a 96 well-plate and 100 \u00b5L to the remaining wells.

A two times serial dilution was performed before adding 100 \u00b5L of freshly prepared methanolic DPPH solution to triplicate wells, except for the compound control wells, in the dark. The plates were covered in foil and shaken on a Titertek microplate shaker (Medical EXPO, Marseilles, France) for 10 min. This was followed by an additional 35 min incubation period in the dark. After the incubation, absorbance readings were obtained at 517 nm using a Multiscan Sky microplate reader (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA).\n2.9.2. DEPPD Assay\nThe DEPPD assay was used to determine reactive oxygen metabolites (hydroperoxide) produced by reactive oxygen species (ROS) in PC cells. The oxidative status and ROS reduction potential of the MIA PaCa-2 cells pre- and post-treatment (72 h) with 0.33% DMSO and optimised working concentrations: 8 \u00b5M for BA and PEG-BA and 9 \u00b5M gemcitabine, were determined using the DEPPD assay. The assay was performed according to the protocol by William (2012), with modifications to accommodate using cell supernatants instead of the standard urine or blood samples [47]. Briefly, 140 \u00b5L of 0.1 M sodium acetate buffer (pH 4.8) was added to a 96-well plate. This was followed by adding 10 \u00b5L of 0.39\u201350 \u00b5M hydrogen peroxide standard and cell supernatants of negative control of (media only), vehicle control, BA and PEG-BA and standard gemcitabine. One hundred microlitres of R1/R2 solution (100 \u00b5g/mL DEPPD (R1) and 4.37 \u00b5M FeSO4 (R2) at a ratio of 1:25) was added to all wells except the blank. The plate was covered with foil for at least 1 min and analysed using a Victor\u2122 X3 model 2030 multilabel plate reader (PerkinElmer, Waltham, MA, USA) at a wavelength of 505 nm with a kinetic loop of 30 readings per well."

To assess whether the data were normally distributed, normality tests such as the Shapiro\u2013Wilk (W), Anderson\u2013Darling (A2*), D\u2019Agostino\u2013Pearson omnibus (K2), and Kolmogorov\u2013Smirnov (distance) that are available in the GraphPad Prism (version 8) software were used. It was assumed that a p-value greater than \u03b1 (0.05) meant that the null hypothesis (H0) was accepted, and the data were classified as following a normal distribution. Furthermore, quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plots were assessed with the assumption that plotting predicted residual vs. actual residual forms a roughly straight line for normally distributed data. For two groups (passed normality tests and Q-Q plots), an unpaired Student t-test was performed. A two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed for more than two groups, followed by multiple comparisons using the Tukey post hoc test, if the data passed the normality tests and Q-Q plots. For data that only passed the normality tests but not the Q-Q plots, the non-parametric Kruskal\u2013Wallis was performed followed by Dunn\u2019s post hoc test.

            "text": "Pancreatic cancer is associated with chemoresistance. The conjugation of PEG to BA has been shown to kill PC cells effectively and selectively and could circumvent chemoresistance [8]. Analysing critical cellular processes such as apoptosis, inflammation and antioxidation during treatment with PEG-BA can help delineate the molecular mechanisms associated with treatment with the conjugated drug. In this study, PC cells were treated with PEG-BA and its proapoptotic and antioxidative characteristics were demonstrated compared with the free compound, BA and relevant controls. MIA PaCa-2 cells were assessed using light microscopy to determine the effect of treatment on morphology. In this study, the characteristic spindle-shaped (elongated) morphology of MIA PaCa-2 cells was observed in the untreated sample [50]. Similarly, most BA-treated cells retained that morphology and the cells continued to grow and were still attached to neighbouring cells. A second population of smaller, rounded-up cells was also observed. It is well-documented that the rounding up and shrinkage of cells are critical characteristic features of initiation and progression into apoptosis [51,52]. This is also associated with an intact plasma membrane with reduced cytoplasm, further indicating an earlier phase of apoptosis and not necrosis [53]. Coricovac and colleagues (2021) tested the effect on the morphology of A375 human melanoma cells using BA (5\u201350 \u00b5M). Their results showed that apoptotic cells (smaller and rounded up) were present in a high percentage at 10 and 50 \u00b5M, suggesting that a high concentration of BA is required to visualise sufficient morphological differences to the untreated sample [54]. A similar finding was reported by Xu and colleagues (2014), where at least 30 \u00b5M of BA was required to inhibit 50% of Hela cells [55]. In contrast, PEG-BA resulted in a dose-dependent induction of cell rounding and shrinkage, which was confirmed by the cytotoxicity results even at 2 \u00b5M, suggesting that conjugation improved not only cytotoxicity but also apoptosis induction (confirmed in the downstream analysis performed in this study). Cell cycle analysis studies, represented by the DNA content, showed an arrest of the cancer cells in the sub-G1 phase after treatment with PEG-BA, relative to the untreated and BA-treated cells, suggesting an increase in apoptosis. Studies have shown that the presence of cells in the sub-G1 phase indicates apoptotic cells or the induction of apoptosis [56]. This is because this phase represents hypodiploid cells with a DNA content less than that in the G1 phase [56,57]. DNA degradation, a notable characteristic of apoptosis, can be one of the causes of the reduced DNA content, indicating that the cells found in the peak before the G1/G0 are undergoing apoptosis [56,57]. BA has been shown to induce apoptosis in various tumours, including leukaemia [58], neuroblastoma [59,60], cervical cancer [61], colon cancer [62], multiple myeloma [63] and PC [8]. In this study, both PEG-BA and BA induced a reduction of cancer cells in the S-phase, suggesting inhibition of DNA synthesis. The compounds also reduced the population of cells in the G2/M phase, indicative of diminished cell proliferation and viability. Similar findings have been reported using PANC-1 and IGROV-1 cells treated with BA, resulting in either a sub-G1 or a G1/G0 phase arrest [64,65]. Taken together, the findings from this study suggest that the drug conjugate PEG-BA induced increased apoptosis compared with free BA, and inhibited DNA synthesis, reduced cell proliferation and viability of PC cells. Similar to the cell cycle findings, gene expression analysis further suggested a possible apoptosis-inducing ability of PEG-BA. PEG-BA induced the overexpression of proapoptotic genes of the extrinsic and intrinsic pathways, compared with free BA. According to the Central Dogma of molecular biology, DNA serves as the genetic material that is transcribed into messenger RNA and translated into proteins which are essential for cellular functioning [66]. Therefore, a link exists between mRNA and protein levels. A study by Vogel and Marcotte (2013) showed that there is a 40% correlation between gene expression (mRNA quantification) and protein levels [67]. Hence, in this study, the real-time PCR results were compared with literature findings based on proteins that function in apoptosis to try and predict the potential apoptotic mechanism of PEG-BA in PC cells. In cancer, the expression of antiapoptotic genes is elevated, and proapoptotic genes are downregulated [20,21]. TNF\nPolymers 2023, 15, 448 13 of 17\nand TNFSF10 were upregulated post-PEG-BA treatment in PC cells (Figure 3A). These genes code for pro-inflammatory cytokines, which act as ligands that bind to death receptors, initiating the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis [15]. The products of TNF and TNFSF10 can be inhibited by binding to decoy receptors such as cFLIP, which are overexpressed in several cancer types and aid cell proliferation, growth and survival [26,27]. The inhibition occurs because of the absence of a death effector domain (DED), used by tumour necrosis factor receptor type 1-associated DEATH domain (TRADD) adaptor molecules and procaspase 8 to form the DISC, whose inhibition disrupts the extrinsic pathway of apoptosis [26,27]. CASPASE 2 and 8, which code for initiator caspases 2 and 8, and CASPASE 3 and 7, which code for executioner caspases 3 and 7, were also overexpressed after PEG-BA treatment (Figure 3B,D). The initiator caspases are activated by forming complexes that facilitate their hydrolysis, which is necessary for caspase function [13]. The activated initiators then activate the executioner caspases, resulting in apoptosis activation. Both types of caspases are inhibited by the inhibitors of apoptosis (IAPs), which are generally overexpressed in cancer cells to favour survival and evade cell death [68,69]. The function of Bid protein in type 2 cells with low caspase signal is necessary for the activation of the mitochondrial pathway, either by direct inhibitory binding to the Bcl-2 protein, allowing Bax/Bak oligomerisation or directly triggering the release of Cyt C [70\u201372]. In this study, PEG-BA resulted in the overexpression of BAX and BID in the MIA PaCa-2 cells. In most cancers, including PC, both proapoptotic proteins are inhibited by high expression of Bcl-2 antiapoptotic proteins, facilitating the evasion of apoptosis [73]. A study by Naseri and colleagues (2015) showed apoptosis could be restored in cancer cells such as HepG2, T47D and HCT116 by activating Bax [74]. Conjugating PEG to BA improved the apoptosis-inducing ability of the free drug by activating proapoptotic genes. It is well-documented that NF-\u03baB protein subunits play an important role in inflammation, cell differentiation, proliferation, and death [75\u201377]. At rest, NF-\u03baB is inactivated by the bound inhibitor IKB protein family preventing its translocation to the nucleus [76]. Phosphorylation inhibits IKBs and releases NF-\u03baB, leading to dimerisation of its subunits (canonical: p50 and p65 or non-canonical: p100 and p52), which is translocated to the nucleus and activates transcription of their target genes [76,78]. In this study, NF-\u03baB levels in the cell lysate were higher than in the supernatant, confirming its intracellular location and that disruption of the plasma membrane was necessary to release adequate amounts of the protein [76]. A slight but insignificant increase in NF-\u03baB was observed after treatment with PEG-BA compared with untreated cancer cells. BA has been shown to activate NF-\u03baB by inducing phosphorylation of the IKBs [6,65]. Notably, the present study showed an upregulation of TNF, an activator of NF-\u03baB [74,75], with PEG-BA treatment. Although some studies have demonstrated the role of NF-\u03baB in inducing cell survival pathways in several malignancies [73], several others have determined its role in apoptosis, specifically its p65 subunit [74\u201377]. NF-\u03baB is necessary for BA-induced apoptotic cell death [65]. Ryan et al. (2000) demonstrated the proapoptotic role of NF-\u03baB in Soas-2 cells. They found that p53 (a protein also increased in MIA PaCa-2 cells) induces translocation of NF-\u03baB to the nucleus, thereby activating binding to DNA [79]. In addition, inhibiting NF-\u03baB reduced apoptosis, suggesting that NF-\u03baB may be crucial in the induction of apoptosis by doxorubicin in Soas-2 cells [79]. Another study showed that the activation of the NF-\u03baB/p65 by aspirin resulted in the induction of Bax-dependent apoptosis in human colorectal carcinoma cells [80]. It is worth noting that in this study, PEG-BA treatment resulted in overexpression of BAX in the PC cells. These findings may suggest that NF-\u03baB plays an important proapoptotic role, which may be improved by PEG-BA treatment. PEG-BA treatment further improved antioxidant potential, demonstrated by a lower IC50 (15.59 \u00b1 0.64 \u00b5M), suggesting a higher radical scavenging potential than ascorbic acid and BA. On the other hand, treatment with BA resulted in an IC50 greater than 100 \u00b5M, suggesting a lower antioxidant potential than ascorbic acid with an IC50 of 25.58 \u00b1 0.44 \u00b5M. A similar observation was made by Adesanwo and colleagues (2013), where they assessed the antioxidant capacity of BA isolated from Tetracera potatoria roots and reported an\nPolymers 2023, 15, 448 14 of 17\neven higher IC50 value of 309 \u00b5M [81]. Several studies have reported that medicinal plants possess antioxidant activities with desirable radical scavenging abilities [81,82]. This is due to the presence of phenolic groups and tocopherols that can readily donate hydrogen atoms, which is an essential aspect of the DPPH assay, as it is based on the electron transfer ability of potential antioxidants [81,83]. Therefore, with an increase in the number of hydroxyl groups (-OH) or other hydrogen donating groups (-NH, -SH, etc.) in the molecular structure of a compound, the higher the antioxidant activity [81]. Our results, therefore, demonstrate that conjugating PEG to BA improves antioxidant activities due to the inherent anti-inflammatory property of BA, but also with added advantages such as improved solubility associated with conjugation. The DEPPD assay confirmed significantly high concentrations of hydroperoxides in the PC cells compared with the normal cells (Figure 6), which has also been shown in other studies [32]. A moderate decrease in hydroperoxide concentrations was observed in PEGBA-treated cancer cells compared with untreated cells. The reduction may be indicative of antioxidant activities [84]. Anticancer compounds possessing antioxidant potential are ideal due to the added advantage of combatting inflammation (ROS), potentially blocking cancer progression [31\u201333]. Our group has previously shown that PEG-BA downregulates the expression of Th1/Th2/Th17 cytokines involved in inflammatory processes, further confirming the anti-inflammatory ability of the conjugate [8,9]."
