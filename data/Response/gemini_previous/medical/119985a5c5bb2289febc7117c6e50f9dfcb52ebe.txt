1. **Investigate the effect of different bio-based flame retardants on the properties of RPCMs.**

The study used a specific bio-based flame retardant system based on CS/APP/PA-Ba. Future research could explore the use of other bio-based flame retardants, such as lignin, starch, or cellulose, to determine their impact on the properties of RPCMs. This could lead to the development of RPCMs with improved flame retardancy, thermal stability, or other desired properties.


2. **Explore the use of RPCMs in different battery thermal management systems.**

The study demonstrated the effectiveness of RPCMs in a single-cell battery thermal management system. Future research could investigate the performance of RPCMs in more complex battery systems, such as multi-cell battery packs or battery modules used in electric vehicles. This would help to determine the feasibility of using RPCMs in real-world applications.


3. **Study the long-term stability and durability of RPCMs.**

The study did not investigate the long-term stability and durability of RPCMs. Future research could conduct accelerated aging tests to assess the performance of RPCMs over extended periods of time. This information would be valuable for understanding the reliability and lifespan of RPCMs in battery thermal management systems.


4. **Develop models to predict the thermal performance of RPCMs.**

The study did not develop models to predict the thermal performance of RPCMs. Future research could develop computational models to simulate the heat transfer behavior of RPCMs in battery thermal management systems. This would allow researchers to optimize the design of RPCMs and battery thermal management systems for specific applications.


5. **Investigate the potential environmental impacts of RPCMs.**

The study did not assess the potential environmental impacts of RPCMs. Future research could conduct life cycle assessments to evaluate the environmental impacts of RPCMs, including their production, use, and disposal. This information would be important for understanding the sustainability of RPCMs and for making informed decisions about their use in battery thermal management systems.
