In this paper, for the first time, we show analytically and confirm with three-dimensional particle-incell simulations that angular incoherence provides suppression of the instability growth rate that is additional to and much stronger than that provided by the well-known temporal and spatial incoherence usually used in ICF studies. For the model used in our calculations, the maximum field ratio between the stimulated Raman scattering and the driving pulses drops from 0.2 for a Laguerre\u2013Gaussian pulse with a single nonzero topological charge to 0.05 for a super light spring with an angular momentum spread and random relative phases. In particular, angular incoherence does not introduce extra undesirable hot electrons. This provides a novel method for suppressing LPI by using light with an angular momentum spread and paves the way towards a low-LPI laser system for inertial fusion energy with a super light spring of incoherence in all dimensions of time, space, and angle, and may open the door to the use of longer-wavelength lasers for inertial fusion energy. \u00a9 2023 Author(s).

Thus, mitigation of LPI effects is crucial for achieving predictable and reproducible fusion at high gain in the progress toward the practical realization of inertial fusion energy. To suppress LPI for ICF, it has been proposed that the instability growth rate in the plasma could be reduced by either temporal or spatial incoherence of the driving laser. This is because the incoherence of a laser can be understood as a superimposition of temporal and spatial modes, which changes the amplitude a or intensity a of the laser in time or space. We know that the total laser energy can be written as \u221d \u222b adt, while the total instability growth in the linear region can be written as \u221d \u222b adt. Thus, for a given total laser energy, a laser with a changing amplitude exhibits less total instability growth. The effect of incoherence in suppressing LPI can also be explained in another way. For two given stimulated waves, such as a plasma wave and a scattering wave, only one mode of the driving laser can couple with them exactly resonantly, while the others contribute less to the instability growth rate. Therefore, for a given average laser intensity, an incoherent laser has a lower instability growth rate. To date, many methods have been proposed to suppress LPI using spatial and temporal incoherence in the driving lasers, through, for example, laser smoothing techniques and broadband laser technology. For the latter in particular, both theoretical and experimental results indicate that the linear growth of LPI can be controlled well when the laser bandwidth is much larger than the growth rate. Meanwhile, decoupled broadband lasers or polychromatic lights Matter Radiat.

Even with these methods, the SRS of the inner laser beams at the National Ignition Facility (NIF) remains a major problem for high-convergence implosion with a CH capsule inside a gasfilled hohlraum driven by a long laser pulse. The inner beams of the NIF hohlraums have a long propagation path and encounter plasma blowoff from the high-Z walls, low-Z plasma ablated from the capsule, and any filling gas within the hohlraum, which results eventually in unpredictable and serious SRS. With the aim of achieving a low level of LPI, attention has turned to the use of ablators made of high-density carbon (HDC), which has the advantage of high density, allowing the use of thinner capsules and shorter laser pulses and thus leading to a low level of LPI and better symmetry control in low gas-filled hohlraums. With an HDC capsule, the recent tremendous breakthrough of 3.15 MJ fusion yield from 2.05 MJ energy input on the NIF has provided a successful demonstration of ignition in ICF.35 Nevertheless, the NIF results demonstrate that there is a limit on the degree to which LPI can be reduced via both temporal incoherence and spatial incoherence, and suppression of SRS is still a crucial task if the NIF is to be able to achieve a predictable and reproducible fusion gain via a low-entropy and high-convergence implosion driven by a long laser pulse. Given that the temporal and spatial dimensions are related to energy (frequency) and momentum, while the angular dimension is related to angular momentum, it should be possible to suppress LPI via angular incoherence. The spatial coherence area is usually expressed as the product of two spatial lengths, that is, \u0394s = \u0394y \u22c5 \u0394z for a laser propagating in the x direction. We can rewrite this as \u0394s = r\u0394r\u0394\u03c6. In this way, \u0394r is related to radial coherence and \u0394\u03c6 to angular coherence. Taking SRS as an example, we know that SRS in plasma is a three-wave coupling process related to the decay of a driving laser into an electron plasma wave and a scattering wave, in which the following frequency and wave number matching corresponding to energy and momentum conservation must be satisfied: \u03c9L = \u03c91 + \u03c92 and kL = k1 + k2. In addition to energy and momentum, the driving laser may also carry angular momentum, in which case angular momentum conservation must also be satisfied for the LPI, that is, LL = L1 + L2. In fact, the presence of orbital angular momentum in the driving laser beam (such as in a Laguerre\u2013Gaussian beam) has been used to study Raman scattering in laser\u2013plasma interaction. In this paper, we propose for the first time to suppress LPI with angularly incoherent light and pay particular attention to the effect of angular incoherence on the instability growth rate, which should pave the way towards a low-LPI laser system with a super light spring of incoherence in all dimensions of time, space, and angle. We prove analytically and with three-dimensional (3D) particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations that angular incoherence provides suppression of the instability growth rate that is additional to and much stronger than that provided by temporal incoherence. A good description of the radial and angular momenta of the driving laser can be given using the Laguerre\u2013Gaussian modes aL(x, t) = an exp [i\u03c9Lt \u2212 ikLx + ilL\u03c6 + \u03c6], (1) where an is the transverse profile, \u03c9L is the laser frequency, kL = 2\u03c0/\u03bbL is the wave number, lL is the topological charge, \u03c6 = tan\u22121(z/y), and \u03c6 is the original phase at the waist plane. The transverse profile an is given by an = a0(\u22121) Cpl w(x)[ \u221a 2r w(x)] \u2223l\u2223 exp [\u2212 r 2 w(x) ]L \u2223l\u2223 p ( 2r 2 w(x) ), where a0 is the normalized amplitude, Cpl is a normalization constant, w(x) = w0 \u221a 1 + x/x R [where xR is the Rayleigh length Rx = (x + x R)/x and w0 is the beam-waist radius], r = \u221a y + z, is the associated Laguerre polynomial, and p is the number of radial nodes in the intensity distribution. In this paper, we concentrate on studying the effect of angular incoherence, and therefore we set p \u2261 0. Here, we consider a specific case. The driving laser is a superimposition of N modes of different frequency \u03c9L and topological charge lL. The laser amplitude is written as aL(x, t) = N\u22121 \u2211 n=0 an exp [i\u03c9Lnt \u2212 ikLnx + ilLn\u03c6 + \u03c6n]. (2) For simplicity, we assume an \u2261 a0. The frequencies \u03c9Ln = 1 + n\u03b51\u03c9L0 of the modes have the same interval \u03b51\u03c9L0, and the total bandwidth is \u0394\u03c9 = (N \u2212 1)\u03b51\u03c9L0, where \u03c9L0 is the frequency of the first mode and \u03b51 is a constant that indicates the bandwidth gap. Usually, \u0394\u03c9/\u03c9L0 \u226a 1. The charges lLn = 1 + n\u03b52lL0 and the total topological charge spread \u0394l = (N \u2212 1)\u03b52lL0, where lL0 is the topological charge corresponding to the first mode and \u03b52 is a constant that indicates the topological charge gap. Typically, \u03b52lL0 is an integer. If \u03c6n \u2261 0, the structure of such a laser is called a light spring. Thus, the distribution of the highest intensities, that is, the strong point, resembles a spring. In this paper, we call a light spring with random phases \u03c6n a super light spring. Hereinafter, for simplicity, a laser with Laguerre\u2013Gaussian modes is referred to as an LG laser, and a laser with a light spring or super light spring structure is referred to as an LS or super LS laser. Owing to superimposition, the amplitude for \u03c6n \u2261 0 can be written as aL(x, r, \u03c6, t) = a0(r) sin [N(\u03b51\u03c9L0t \u2212 \u03b51kL0x \u2212 \u03b52lL0\u03c6)/2] sin [(\u03b51\u03c9L0t \u2212 \u03b51kL0x \u2212 \u03b52lL0\u03c6)/2] . (3) This implies that the angular spread is reduced to 2\u03c0/N, and the angular position of the highest intensity can be written as \u03c6max = \u03b51\u03c9L0t/(\u03b52lL0). By changing \u03c6 from 0 to 2\u03c0, we can obtain the pitch of an LS laser. SRS of a nonrelativistic laser can be described by ( \u2202 2 \u2202t \u2212 c\u2207 + \u03c9pe)\u00e3 = \u2212\u00f1eaL, (4) ( \u2202 2 \u2202t + \u03c9pe \u2212 3v e\u2207)\u00f1e = n0\u2207(aL \u22c5 \u00e3), (5) where \u03c9pe is the electron plasma frequency, aL is the vector potential of the driving laser pulse, \u00e3 is the vector potential of the backscattered wave, \u00f1e is the plasma density perturbation, and n0 = \u03c9pe/4\u03c0e. We neglect the radial gradient (this is reasonable for a sufficiently large focal spot) and consider that a wave of the form Matter Radiat.

Therefore, the present formulas for the growth rate is the same as before except for the correction term\n(lL0\u0394lc2)2/6(\u03c9s0\u03b3sR2)2. According to Eqs. (9) and (11), we can see that there are two correction terms that can reduce the instability growth rate. One is the total bandwidth \u0394\u03c9, which has been widely investigated in ICF. The other is the total topological charge spread \u0394l. Note that at \u0394l > (1/lL0)(\u03c9s0/\u03c9L0)(2\u03c0R/\u03bbL0)2(\u0394\u03c9/\u03c9L0), the \u0394l term will dominate the correction term, and hence the spread of angular momentum plays a more important role than the bandwidth in suppressing \u03b3s. Because \u0394\u03c9/\u03c9L0 \u226a 1, it is easy to realize \u0394l > (1/lL0)(\u03c9s0/\u03c9L0)(2\u03c0R/\u03bbL0)2(\u0394\u03c9/\u03c9L0) for a real superimposed laser pulse.\nTo confirm the above analysis, we perform 3D PIC simulations using the POCH code.44 In all simulations, we set \u03b52lL0 = 1. To reduce the simulation time, we take lL0 = 3 and N = 7, resulting in an average topological charge l = 6. Note that a much larger lL0 can be used in a real experiment. For simplicity, we consider the same transverse profile for each mode in Eq. (2):\nan \u2261 a0 = a00( \u221a\n2r w0 )\nlL0\nexp(\u2212 r 2\nw20 ).\nTo further reduce the simulation time, we choose a large amplitude a00 = 0.06, w0 = 10 \u03bcm. The central laser wavelength is \u03bbLc = 0.8 \u03bcm and the corresponding central frequency is \u03c9Lc = 3.75 \u00d7 1014 Hz. The frequency of the first mode is \u03c9L0 = 3.4125 \u00d7 1014 Hz (\u03c9L0 = 0.91\u03c9Lc).\nTherefore, the power of the LS pulse is P = 0.16 TW. The frequency separation \u03b51\u03c9L0 = 0.03\u03c9Lc = 0.033\u03c9L0 (\u03b51 = 0.033), and thus the total frequency spread is (N \u2212 1)\u03b51\u03c9L0 = 0.198\u03c9L0. With this, we obtain a pitch \u0394x = 2\u03c0c/(\u03b51\u03c9L0) \u2248 27 \u03bcm for the LS pulse. The laser has a constant amplitude in time, with a duration of about 93.3 fs. The plasma density in the simulation is ne = 1.7 \u00d7 1020 cm\u22123. The size of the simulation box is 60 \u03bcm (x) \u00d7 80 \u03bcm (y) \u00d7 80 \u03bcm (z), corresponding to a moving window of 600 \u00d7 800 \u00d7 800 cells, with one particle per cell. The plasma occupies the 15 \u03bcm < x < 800 \u03bcm region in the direction of the laser pulse propagation, and \u221275 \u03bcm < y < 75 \u03bcm, \u221275 \u03bcm < z < 75 \u03bcm. It should be noted here that we consider a plasma with a relatively high density to ensure that the scattered wave can be separated from the driving wave completely in spectral space and then filtered out for mathematical analysis. Actually, the angular coherence as well as the temporal and spatial coherences are characteristics of the light, and the suppression of SRS for an LS laser with angular incoherence also works in a low-density plasma.\nFigure 1(a) shows the 2D k-space distribution of the driving laser pulse after propagation for 240 \u03bcm. As can be seen, the LS pulse is composed of seven separated frequencies, and the weak signal on the left side of the driving laser is Raman scattering. For comparison, we consider a broadband LG laser pulse, which is a superimposition of N modes with different frequencies but the same topological charge l , that is, with a spread of \u03b52lL0 = 0 for the angular momentum. The total power and other parameters remain the same as those for the above LS pulse. Figure 1(b) shows the 2D k-space distribution for the LG case, again after the pulse has propagated 240 \u03bcm. Clearly, there is a much stronger SRS signal in the LG case, which confirms the above theoretical expectation that the \u0394l incoherence\nMatter Radiat.

Spectral distributions in k space when the driving laser pulse reaches x = 240 \u03bcm for (a) an LS pulse with topological charge varying from l = 3 to l = 9 and total bandwidth \u0394\u03c9 = 0.198\u03c9L0 and (b) an LG pulse with topological charge l = 6 and bandwidth \u0394\u03c9 = 0.198\u03c9L0.

The SRS signal is marked by the white dotted box.\ndominates the suppression of instabilities. We have also performed the simulations for a laser composed of Gaussian pulses at multiple frequencies, and the results are similar to those in the case of a broadband LG pulse and there is less of a suppressive effect than in the case of an LS pulse with \u0394l incoherence.\nTo clearly observe the growth process of SRS due to \u0394l, we plot in Fig. 2 the maximum field ratio between the SRS and the driving pulses along the laser propagation direction for different cases of \u0394\u03c9 and \u0394l. The maximum field ratio is denoted by \u03b7S = Es/EL, where Es and EL are the maximum fields of the SRS and driving pulses, respectively. From Fig. 2, we can observe the following. First, \u03b7S is highest for \u03b51 = 0 and \u03b52lL0 = 0, indicating that this case has the most serious SRS for an LG pulse with a single frequency and a single topological charge. Second, at \u03b52lL0 = 0, i.e., with a single topological charge, \u03b7S at 200 \u03bcm decreases from 0.36 in the narrowband case (\u03b51 = 0) to 0.2 in the broadband case (\u03b51 = 0.033). This means that, as is well known, the use of a broadband pulse can help to suppress SRS. Third, keeping the same frequency band, we compare the LS\ncase (\u03b52lL0 = 1) and the LG case (\u03b52lL0 = 0). As can be seen, in the narrowband case (\u03b51 = 0), \u03b7S at 200 \u03bcm drops from 0.36 for the LG pulse to 0.15 for the LS pulse; and for the broadband case (\u03b51 = 0.033), \u03b7S drops from 0.2 for the LG pulse to 0.05 for the LS pulse with random phase. These results indicate that the angular spread \u0394l can strongly suppress SRS growth.\nIt should be noted here that if a laser is composed of several beamlets with the same frequency but different topological charges, such as in the case of \u03b51 = 0 and \u03b52lL0 = 1, then the pitch of the LS pulse is infinite. This implies that the strong point with the highest intensity remains unchanged in the transverse direction. However, as shown in Fig. 2, SRS can still be suppressed to some degree, even though the peak intensity is much larger than that for an LG pulse. This strongly supports our idea that the spread of the angular momentum of the laser plays an important role in suppressing SRS. In addition, from Eq. (11), we can see that the suppressive effect is positively correlated with \u0394l. This implies that the suppressive effect is stronger for larger \u0394l. It should be noted that a large \u0394l means that the (average) topological charge of the LS beam should also be large, which means that the transverse spot of the driving beam must be sufficiently large. However, the focal spot of the driving beam in ICF is usually several hundred micrometers in size, which is large enough compared with the 10 \u03bcm spot that we considered above. Therefore, taking account of the practical manipulations involved in ICF, the results in the present paper will be applicable at larger \u0394l.\nOne concern is that the superimposition of the LG beamlets produces a strong point in space and time, which may produce extra hot electrons and generate unacceptable shock preheating and entropy in the ICF fuel. Thus, it is necessary to investigate whether an LS pulse may produce more hot electrons and a higher electron temperature than an LG pulse. Figure 3 compares the electron distributions in the plasma driven by LG and LS pulses, respectively. Here, the plasma wave has still not completely decayed. It can clearly be seen that the LS pulse does not produce a high temperature or more hot electrons. Thus, the spread of the angular momentum of the LG pulse does not give rise to extra hot electrons. It should also be noted that SRS is a relatively long-term behavior in laser\u2013plasma interaction. Here, we have considered relatively short pulses of 93.3 fs to save computational time. To avoid artificial results, we have carried out an additional PIC simulation for a longer duration of 186.6 fs, and this also shows a clear suppressive effect and a similar growth rate.\nMatter Radiat. Extremes 8, 035902 (2023); doi: 10.1063/5.0136567 8, 035902-4\n\u00a9 Author(s) 2023\n18 January 2024 23:08:03\nIn a laser facility, several laser beamlets are usually clustered into a laser bundle, which is used to drive a target. This makes it possible to change the beamlets from the usual Gaussian pulses to LG pulses with different topological charges and combine them into a super LS pulse with a spread topological charge. As shown in Fig. 4, an LS pulse can be produced by clustering obliquely incident LG beams of different frequencies \u03c9L and topological charges lL owing to the changing thickness of the phase plate azimuthally. The incident angles \u03b8 of each incident LG beam relative to the x axis as shown in Fig. 4 differ slightly, owing to the small differences between the distances from the beamlets to the center of the source field plane. The pitch of the LS pulse is \u0394x = 2\u03c0c/(\u03c9L0\u03b51), with \u03c9L0\u03b51 = \u0394\u03c9/\u0394l. For large laser facilities, it is at present still very difficult to control the relative phases of the beamlets. This implies that \u03d5n is not the same for different LG pulses. Therefore, we usually obtain a super LS because of the random phase. Although this has several strong points\ninstead of a single perfect one, the spread of the angular momentum remains. The lowest growth rate is obtained in this case owing to the additional spatial incoherence, as shown in Fig. 2.\nIn a laser facility, we can create super LS bundles with incoherence in all dimensions of time, space, and angle by combining LG beamlets. By controlling the phases and frequencies of these beamlets before their combination, we can finally obtain the following three cases of the LS bundle, as shown in Fig. 4: (a) LS light with long pitch, which is narrowband, with one strong point of time-independent intensity; (b) LS light of short pitch, which is broadband, with one strong point of time-dependent intensity; (c) super LS light, with several strong points of time-dependent intensity owing to the random phase. Our results for these three cases confirm that angular incoherence clearly reduces the instability growth rate, with the suppressive effect of the super LS light being the most significant and even much stronger than that of temporal incoherence.\nIn summary, using both theoretical analysis and 3D PIC simulations, we have demonstrated the ability of an LS pulse with angular incoherence to suppress SRS in a plasma, which is of great significance for laser-driven ICF. According to our analytical study and simulations, angular incoherence has a much stronger suppressive effect on the instability growth rate than the temporal incoherence that is typically used. In particular, it is the angular momentum spread that plays an important role instead of the topological charge in suppressing instabilities. In other words, little suppression of SRS is achievable by only increasing the topological charge. In addition, it is interesting to note that the LS pulse does not generate additional hot electrons. It should be noted that in the simulations in this paper, we have considered the suppression of SRS as a specific example, but our conclusions can be applied to the suppression of SBS and other parametric instabilities. In a laser system, laser bundles of a super LS pulse can be generated by combining LG laser beamlets with different frequencies, different topological charges, and slightly different incidence angles, which can be produced from Gaussian beamlets using different phase plates. Our work has revealed a novel way to suppress LPI using light with angular incoherence, and it should\nMatter Radiat.

This may pave the way toward a low-LPI laser system for achieving predictable and reproducible fusion at high gain and may open the door to the use of longer-wavelength lasers for inertial fusion energy.\nThis work was supported by the National Key R&D Program of China (Grant No. 2018YFA0404803) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 11922515, 11935008, 11335013, and 12035002)."
