However, novel numerical methods, scalable algorithms and re-design of current state-of-the art numerical solvers are required for scaling to these machines with minimal overheads. One such approach for partial differential equations based solvers involves computation of spatial derivatives with possibly delayed or asynchronous data using high-order asynchrony-tolerant (AT) schemes to facilitate mitigation of communication and synchronization bottlenecks without affecting the numerical accuracy. In the present study, an effective methodology of implementing temporal discretization using a multi-stage Runge-Kutta method with AT schemes is presented. Together these schemes are used to perform asynchronous simulations of canonical reacting flow problems, demonstrated in one-dimension including auto-ignition of a premixture, premixed flame propagation and non-premixed autoignition. Simulation results show that the AT schemes incur very small numerical errors in all key quantities of interest including stiff intermediate species despite delayed data at processing element (PE) boundaries. For simulations of supersonic flows, the degraded numerical accuracy of well-known shock-resolving WENO (weighted essentially non-oscillatory) schemes when used with relaxed synchronization is also discussed. To overcome this loss of accuracy, high-order AT-WENO schemes are derived and tested on linear and non-linear equations. Finally the novel AT-WENO schemes are demonstrated in the propagation of a detonation wave with delays at PE boundaries.\n\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."

Of particular interest is the so-called Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) [1] of reacting and non-reacting turbulent flows wherein all turbulence scales are fully resolved. In the\n* Corresponding author. E-mail address: konduriadi@iisc.ac.in (K. Aditya).\nhttps://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcp.2023.111906 0021-9991/\u00a9 2023 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.\nDNS approach the time-dependent governing Navier-Stokes, energy and species continuity equations are solved with high accuracy, and all dynamically relevant ranges of unsteady spatial and temporal scales are numerically resolved. This stringent resolution criterion imposes prohibitive computational cost and consequently limits the attainable parametric range of relevant DNS. Even for moderate Reynolds number or number of transported species, for example, DNS requires massive supercomputers with hundreds of thousands of processing elements (PEs) working concurrently.\nIn some of the most well resolved DNS of complex flows [2\u201313] high-order finite difference schemes have been used extensively to approximate the spatial derivatives. The parallel efficiency of these schemes is high since they use local stencils extending only to the nearest grid-points to approximate the derivatives. However, in a data parallel decomposition of the domain, where multiple PEs are working on different parts of the computational domain in parallel, the PEs also need to communicate across the processor boundaries of the nearest computational domain neighbors in each direction. These communications proceed in the form of halo exchanges of processor boundary information that is stored in buffer/ghost points. For current state-of-the-art numerical solvers, the PEs synchronize and wait for these halo exchanges to complete before derivatives at PE boundaries are computed. If this synchronization is not imposed, data from the latest communication may not be available at the buffer points. However, if old or delayed data is used at the boundaries with the standard finite difference schemes, the resulting solution is inconsistent and inaccurate [14,15]. Thus, standard schemes inherently necessitate synchronizations at PE boundaries and consequently incur severe penalties due to processor idling, especially when a large number of PEs are used. This is the communication and synchronization bottleneck that is expected to pose a major challenge in efficiently scaling to next-generation exascale machines [16].\nAn efficient way to mitigate this bottleneck is to relax the strict communication and synchronization requirements and perform simulations asynchronously. Essentially the derivatives are computed with the latest available data which may or may not be at the current time level and thus a delay is encountered at the PE boundaries. However, due to the degraded numerical accuracy of standard schemes with asynchrony, alternate approaches are needed for asynchronous computations such that numerical errors incurred are minimal. While asynchronous computations have been utilized successfully for iterative linear solvers [17\u201320], some of the early work in asynchronous simulations of partial differential equations (PDEs) is limited to simple canonical equations in one-dimension. In [21\u201323] the governing equation is modified apriori to offset the effect of asynchrony on the numerical solution. However, extension of this approach to higher order and dimension is very challenging. An alternate approach to realize asynchronous computing is to modify the numerical scheme [14, 15,24,25]. An example of this approach would be the asynchrony-tolerant (AT) schemes of arbitrarily high orders that were used for asynchronous simulations of one-dimensional linear and non-linear equations in [24]. The statistical error analysis of these AT schemes presented in [24] shows that the error depends upon simulation parameters, such as the number of PEs and delays at the boundaries. In a more recent study, the AT schemes were used to perform accurate asynchronous simulations of Burgers\u2019 turbulence [26] and compressible turbulence [27] that also exhibited superior scaling to their synchronous counterpart. Two distinct algorithms, synchronization avoiding (SAA) and communication avoiding (CAA), to efficiently introduce asynchrony at boundaries in a three-dimensional flow solver were also presented and verified in [27]. The ability of the asynchronous method to absorb system noise effects was demonstrated in [26]. The stability and spectral accuracy of AT schemes was analyzed in detail in [28]. To further advance the applicability of AT schemes, multi-physics simulations such as turbulent combustion, requiring massive computations, are a natural next choice.\nAs a first step to evaluate the numerical performance of AT schemes for computationally expensive and highly nonlinear turbulent combustion simulations, several canonical reacting one-dimensional flow problems are performed. In particular, the effect of data asynchrony is studied for autoignition, premixed flame propagation and non-premixed autoignition. Both single-step and detailed chemical mechanisms with stiff reactions are used to test the efficacy of the AT schemes. Moreover, for simulations of flows involving shocks and discontinuities AT-WENO schemes are derived for the first time. These ATWENO schemes are then demonstrated for their numerical performance in simulations of both reacting and non-reacting flow.\nThe remainder of the paper is organized as follows. In section 2 a brief overview of asynchronous computing and AT schemes is presented along with time integration using multi-stage Runge-Kutta schemes. The AT-WENO schemes are derived in section 3 followed by order of accuracy tests. The governing equations are included in section 4 and the numerical test cases and results are presented in section 5. Finally, sections 6 and 7 comprise discussions and conclusions, respectively. The AT schemes used in the simulations and expressions for the AT-WENO schemes are included in the Appendix."

            "text": "To illustrate the asynchronous computing method proposed in [14,15], consider the simple one-dimensional timedependent heat equation,\n\u2202u \u2202t = \u03b1 \u2202\n2u\n\u2202x2 , (1)\nwhere u(x, t) is the temperature and \u03b1 is the diffusion coefficient. This equation can be approximated using a first-order Euler and second-order central difference schemes for spatial and temporal derivatives, respectively, as\nun+1j \u2212 unj t = \u03b1 u n j+1 \u2212 2unj + unj\u22121 x2 +O( t, x2). (2)\nHere un+1j = u(x j, tn) is the temperature at a grid point j and a time level n. This finite difference equation, for a given set of initial and boundary conditions, can be used to evolve the temperature field in a discretized one-dimensional domain (see Fig. 1(a)). Implementation of this numerical method in a serial code is straightforward, as function (u) values at the grid points and at necessary time levels would be available in the processing element\u2019s memory. On the other hand, in a parallel computing model with a distributed memory setting, the one-dimensional domain is decomposed into P subdomains that are mapped to P processes/processing elements (PEs), as illustrated in Fig. 1(b) for P = 2. Now, each PE\u2019s memory would contain a subset of function values that belong to the mapped sub-domain. The grid points in each subdomain can be further divided into two sets: first, the interior points at which the function updates are computed with data available within the PE\u2019s memory, and second, the PE boundary points at which the function updates depend on the data from neighboring PEs. This is facilitated by, as mentioned earlier, the so-called halo exchanges which communicate the necessary function values from a neighboring PE into buffer or ghost points. Note that the function update using Eq. (2) at PE boundary points cannot proceed until the halo exchanges are complete. This is often ensured by imposing explicit synchronization that results in significant overheads.\nIn the asynchronous computing method [15], the halo exchanges are initiated, but no explicit synchronization is imposed. Therefore the function value at buffer points may or may not be at the latest time level n, which modifies the update equation in Eq. (2) for PE boundary points (assuming that the points are at the left boundary) to\nun+1j \u2212 unj t = \u03b1 u n j+1 \u2212 2unj + un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121 x2 +O( t/ x2, t, x2), (3)\nwhere k\u0303 represents the time level delay resulting from the relaxed synchronization. If the communication at the latest time level is complete, then k\u0303 = 0 and the computations at the PE boundary points are synchronous (like the interior points). Otherwise, k\u0303 > 0 and the update equation would involve a delayed function value, resulting in asynchronous computations. Note that depending on the computation and communication time scales, delays at different PE boundaries can be different and can be several time levels older. Let L be the maximum allowable delay between the two PEs at a PE boundary. Then, the delay k\u0303 \u2208 {0,1,2, . . . ,L\u2212 1}. As the arrival of messages at PE boundaries can be modeled as a random process [29], the corresponding delay values, k\u0303, take on random values. Let pk represent the probability of occurrence of a k time level delay, i.e. k\u0303 = k, in a simulation. The sum of probabilities is \u2211L\u22121k=0 pk = 1.\nIt is evident that the numerical properties of standard schemes used asynchronously would not just depend on numerical and physical parameters such as grid resolution ( x), time step ( t) and diffusion coefficient (\u03b1), but would also depend on simulation parameters such as the number of PEs (P), stencil size, delay probabilities (pk) and maximum allowable delay (L). A statistical framework was developed in [15] to assess the numerical properties of finite differences implemented with relaxed communication synchronizations. It was shown that asynchronous computations at the PE boundaries would not only affect the stability and consistency of the overall numerical method, but also significantly degrade the accuracy. For the schemes considered in Eq. (3), the truncation error consists of terms that are functions of t/ x2, t and x2 to leading order. From stability analysis, which gives the relation t \u223c x2 for a constant CFL number, the leading order term is identified as O( t/ x2), which is zeroth-order accurate. Following the analysis described in [15], one can obtain the overall accuracy in the domain to be O( x) or first-order accurate. It can also be shown that the error would scale linearly with the number of PEs P and mean delay \u00af\u0303k. As standard schemes would result in poor accuracy under relaxed data synchronization, new asynchrony-tolerant schemes were derived subsequently [24], which are summarized next."

If L = 1 and M1(0) = M2(0) = M , this system of equations yields coefficients for the standard central difference scheme.

(5) reduces to the standard central difference scheme for the first derivative. The general methodology to derive different families of AT schemes of arbitrary order of accuracy is described in [24].

            "text": "For a fully-discrete system, the global order of accuracy depends on both the spatial and temporal discretizations. In order to compute this global order, a stability relation of the form t \u223c xr is used to express the leading order truncation error term of the time discretization scheme also in terms of grid size ( x). For example, for a fourth-order spatial scheme (O( x4)), if a second-order temporal discretization scheme (O( t2)) is used then the global spatial order is two if t \u223c x and four if t \u223c x2. One of the most widely used schemes for high-order temporal discretization is the multi-stage RungeKutta (RK) method. An S-stage explicit RK scheme for an equation of the form du/dt = f (u, t) over a time step t is given by\nun+1 = un + t S\u2211\ns=0 bs Ks, (6)\nwhere the stages Ks are computed using\nK1 = f (un, tn) Ks = f (un + t s\u22121\u2211 i=1 (asiki), t n + cs t).\n(7)\nHere asi, bs, cs are the coefficients of the RK scheme. For an RK scheme, in advancing from time level n to n +1, intermediate stages Ks are computed. Each of these stages depends upon the previous stages as can be seen from Eq. (7). Thus, for simulations performed in parallel, RK schemes require PEs to communicate and synchronize after every stage in order to update the corresponding values at buffer points. However, if simulations are performed with asynchronous communications using AT schemes, then a fractional delay will be encountered at the intermediate stages and different AT schemes will be required for each stage. An alternate method is proposed to effectively use multi-stage RK schemes with AT that circumvents the need to communicate at every stage and avoids fractional delays.\nIn the presence of delays, each stage Ks is computed using AT schemes at PE boundary points. As mentioned before, the current stage Ks explicitly depends upon the previous stages, Ks\u22121, Ks\u22122, . . . , K1. Thus, to ensure accuracy all the stages of RK scheme are computed locally at both PE boundary and buffer points of each PE. Furthermore, at the old time levels required by the AT scheme, these stages are also computed at the internal points close to the PE boundary. In order to perform the additional computations at buffer points, a larger message of size (= No. of stages in RK \u00d7 spatial stencil) has to be communicated across processors at every time step. However, the PEs no longer communicate at every stage of the RK. Thus, there exists a trade-off between communication which is expensive and computation which is relatively cheap.\nTo illustrate that the RK schemes preserve the order of accuracy when combined with high-order AT schemes, the onedimensional diffusion equation in Eq. (1) is reconsidered. Denoting the right-hand-side of Eq. (1) by f (u, t) = \u22022u/\u2202x2 (excluding the diffusion coefficient, \u03b1), the temporal discretization at the j-th spatial point using a two-stage second-order RK scheme (RK2) is given by\nun+1j = unj + \u03b1 t ( K j,1 2 + K j,2 2 ) (8)\nwhere K j,1 = f (unj , tn), K j,2 = f ( (unj ) \u2217, tn + t ) and (unj ) \u2217 = unj + t( f (unj , tn)) = unj + t\u03b1K j,1. When a standard fourthorder central difference scheme is used for numerical approximation of f (unj , t n), the following K j,1 and K j,2 are obtained,\nK j,1 = \u2212unj\u22122 + 16unj\u22121 \u2212 30unj + 16unj+1 \u2212 unj+2\n12 x2\nK j,2 = \u2212 \u03b1 t(K j\u22122,1) + unj\u22122\n12 x2 +\n4 ( \u03b1 t(K j\u22121,1) + unj\u22121 ) 3 x2 \u2212 5 ( \u03b1 t ( K j,1 ) + unj) 2 x2\n+ 4 ( \u03b1 t(K j+1,1) + unj+1 ) 3 x2 \u2212 \u03b1 t ( K j+2,1 ) + unj+2 12 x2 .\n(9)\nThe Taylor series expansion of Eq. (8) on substituting Eq. (9) then yields a truncation error of the form\nTEnj |sync = 1\n6\n( \u2212 f (0,3)(x, t) ) t2 \u2212 1\n90 \u03b1 f (6,0)(x, t) x4 +O( x6, t3, x4 t) (10)\nor\nTEnj |sync = (\u2212 r2\u03b1u (0,3)(x, t) 6\u03b12 \u2212 1 90 \u03b1u(6,0)(x, t)) x4 +O( x6), (11)\nwhere r\u03b1 = \u03b1 t/ x2 is the diffusive CFL number and the subscript \u201csync\u201d denotes synchronous. Note that from Eq. (11) the global spatial order of accuracy is four.\nWhen a fourth-order AT scheme is used at the boundary points for computation of spatial derivatives, we have\nK j,1 = ( k\u03032 + k\u0303 ) (\u2212un\u2212k\u0303\u22122j\u22122 + 16un\u2212k\u0303\u22122j\u22121 \u2212 30unj + 16unj+1 \u2212 unj+2)\n24 x2\n\u2212 ( k\u03032 + 2k\u0303 ) (\u2212un\u2212k\u0303\u22121j\u22122 + 16un\u2212k\u0303\u22121j\u22121 \u2212 30unj + 16unj+1 \u2212 unj+2)\n12 x2\n+ ( k\u03032 + 3k\u0303 + 2 ) (\u2212un\u2212k\u0303j\u22122 + 16un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121 \u2212 30unj + 16unj+1 \u2212 unj+2)\n24 x2\n(12)\nwhich is used to compute K j,2 = f (unj + t\u03b1K j,1, tn + t) with f (., .) being evaluated using the fourth-order AT-scheme as well. Once again, the Taylor series expansion is used to obtain the truncation error,\nTEnj |AT,k\u0303 = \u2212 5\n24 \u03b1k\u0303\n( k\u03032 + 3k\u0303 + 2 ) u(0,3)(x, t) t3\nx2 \u2212 1 6 u(0,3)(x, t) t2 \u2212 1 90 \u03b1u(6,0)(x, t) x4 +O(k\u03033 t\n3 x ). (13)\nThe above expression simplifies to give a global fourth-order truncation error term when r\u03b1 is substituted, TEnj |AT,k\u0303 = \u2212 \u239b\u239d75k\u0303 ( k\u03032 + 3k\u0303 + 2 ) r3\u03b1u (0,3)(x, t) + 60r2\u03b1u(0,3)(x, t) + 4\u03b13u(6,0)(x, t) 360\u03b12 \u239e\u23a0 x4 +O( x6). (14) When the delay is zero i.e. k\u0303 = 0, the truncation error in Eq. (14) reduces to TEnj |sync (Eq. (11)) which is the synchronous truncation error at the internal points. Therefore, RK schemes can be used with the AT-schemes without affecting the global order of accuracy. During a simulation the stencil data at older time levels for the buffer as well as for internal points are available, and hence standard synchronous schemes can be used to compute the sub-stages K j,s at these points for efficient implementation of RK with AT. Numerical simulations of linear equations were performed using this approach and the global order of accuracy was preserved. Here the order of accuracy tests is shown for RK schemes with AT-WENO schemes that are derived next (see Table 1)."

            "text": "Despite their advantages, central finite difference schemes are not always suitable for performing DNS of, for example, supersonic flows. In the presence of sharp gradients or discontinuities in density, temperature and composition due to detonations, shocks or high pressure flames, the central difference schemes are prone to numerical oscillations and instabilities. A well established numerical technique to accurately simulate flows with piece-wise smooth solutions between discontinuities is the so called weighted essentially non-oscillatory schemes (WENO) [30,31]. These schemes aim to achieve high-order accuracy at the smooth regions of the flow and resolve the discontinuities with minimal oscillations by automatically selecting the locally smoothest stencil. WENO schemes are considerably more expensive than regular central difference schemes due to the need to evaluate the same flux functions from multiple candidate stencils [32]. However, the numerical method is suitable for implementation in finite difference codes using stencil operations very similar to the central difference schemes. Also, the usual advantages of DNS using finite difference schemes including parallelism and scalability apply to the WENO schemes as well. Apart from DNS [33,12], the advantages of WENO schemes have also been demonstrated in implicit large eddy simulations (iLES) [34\u201336].\nIn this section, a brief overview of the standard WENO schemes is provided followed by a discussion on the effect of asynchrony on the standard WENO schemes (AS-WENO) and derivation of the asynchrony-tolerant WENO (AT-WENO) schemes for accurate numerical simulations when delays are observed at PE boundaries. Consider the one-dimensional (x-direction) version of the governing equations:\n\u2202 Q \u2202t + \u2202C \u2202x + \u2202 D \u2202x = S, (15)\nwhere Q is the solution vector, C is the vector comprising the convective flux terms, D is the viscous and molecular diffusion flux vector, and S is the vector of source terms. The exact form of terms in Q , C and D is defined in section 4. In the WENO framework, the terms contained in the D vector do not require any special treatment and are evaluated using central difference schemes (standard or AT). However, the convective flux terms in C have to be computed appropriately to ensure both stability and accuracy in regions near and at discontinuities. Specifically, the derivative of the convective flux \u2202C/\u2202x at a point j is approximated using the flux at the edges, i.e., C\u0302 j\u00b1 12 of a cell I j = [x j\u2212 12 , x j+ 12 ]. The flux at the edges is computed using the WENO approximation procedure that can be carried out using interpolation or reconstruction, and accordingly, requires point values or cell averages of the fluxes. Note that the hat notation (\u0302) is used to denote the variables at cell edges. The derivative is then computed using the relation\n\u2202C\n\u2202x \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 j = C\u0302 j+ 12 \u2212 C\u0302 j\u2212 12 x\n(16)\nfor a uniform grid and the order depends upon the order of the numerical flux approximation C\u0302 j\u00b1 12 . When using finitedifferences, the WENO approximation directly yields the fluxes at the edges in terms of the fluxes at the grid points. For stability, appropriate up-winding of fluxes is also required and is achieved through splitting the flux, for example using the local Lax-Friedrichs flux splitting methodology,\nC = C+ + C\u2212, where C\u00b1 = 1\n2 (C \u00b1 \u03bbmax Q ),\n(17)\nat every grid-point. The quantity \u03bbmax in Eq. (17) is the maximum local wave propagation speed which can be computed as\n\u03bbmax| j = max{(|u|) j\u22121, (|u \u00b1 c|) j\u22121, (|u|) j, (|u \u00b1 c|) j}, (18) where u and c are the local flow velocity and the speed of sound, respectively. The derivative is then simply evaluated using\n\u2202C\n\u2202x \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 j = C\u0302+ j+ 12 \u2212 C\u0302+ j\u2212 12 x + C\u0302\u2212 j+ 12 \u2212 C\u0302\u2212 j\u2212 12 x (19)\nwith an appropriate upwind stencil for approximating both positive and negative fluxes [12]. For computation of derivative in Eq. (19) using the WENO procedure, the first step is to approximate the fluxes at the edges ( j \u00b1 1/2) through an interpolation or a reconstruction procedure. For simplicity, the approximation of these fluxes using an interpolation technique is discussed here in detail. However, the approximation through reconstruction that treats grid-point values as cell averages can also be performed following the steps detailed here. In order to do so, the primitive function defined in [30] is required.\nFor illustration, consider a specific WENO scheme that uses three sub-stencils each of which comprises three grid-points denoted by S(i) , i = {0, 1, 2}, in Fig. 2 to approximate the value of a quantity u\u0302 at cell edges, say j + 1/2, and timelevel n. Taken together the larger stencil obtained by combining these S(i) contains five points. Since the approximation\norder depends upon the number of points, a fifth-order accurate approximation can be obtained with the full stencil for a smooth function. This is the classical three-fifth order WENO scheme, where the three smaller candidate stencils S(0) = { j \u22122, j \u22121, j}, S(1) = { j \u22121, j, j +1}, and S(2) = { j, j +1, j +2} give a degree two polynomial interpolation of u\u0302n\nj+ 12 at time\nlevel n. The synchronous third-order interpolant in each of the three stencils can be computed using Taylor series expansion or Lagrange interpolation [30,31],\nu\u0302n,(0) j+ 12 = 3 8 unj\u22122 \u2212 5 4 unj\u22121 + 15 8 unj +O( x3)\nu\u0302n,(1) j+ 12 = \u22121 8 unj\u22121 + 3 4 unj + 3 8 unj+1 +O( x3)\nu\u0302n,(2) j+ 12 = 3 8 unj + 3 4 unj+1 \u2212 1 8 unj+2 +O( x3).\n(20)\nThe final approximation is taken as a convex combination of the above three third-order approximations, yielding a higher order interpolant in the larger stencil. Ideally, if u(x, t) is smooth in the large stencil S = 2\u22c3\ni=0 S(i) = { j \u2212 2, j \u2212 1, j, j +\n1, j + 2}, a fifth-order approximation can be achieved using the following expression:\nu\u0302n j+ 12\n= 2\u2211\ni=0 \u03c9i u\u0302\nn,(i) j+ 12 , (21)\nwhere \u03c9i \u2019s are the non-linear weights\n\u03c9i = \u03b1i2\u2211 i=0 \u03b1i , \u03b1i = \u03b3i ( + \u03b2(i))2 . (22)\nThe non-linear weights in Eq. (22) satisfy wi \u2265 0 and 2\u2211\ni=0 \u03c9i = 1 and are related to the ideal or linear weights \u03b3i through the\nsmoothness indicator \u03b2(i) [37,31,38]. A simple Taylor series expansion yields the ideal weights \u03b3 = { 116 , 58 , 516 }, such that\nu\u0302n j+ 12 = 3 128 unj\u22122 \u2212 5 32 unj\u22121 + 45 64 unj + 15 32 unj+1 \u2212 5 128 unj+2 +O( x5). (23)\nWe now focus on the effect of data asynchrony on each of the individual approximations. Consider a point j at the left processor boundary with a delay k\u0303 encountered at each of the buffer points. The order of accuracy of the interpolants in the first two stencils is affected by this delay,\nu\u0302n,(0) j+ 12 = 3 8 un\u2212k\u0303j\u22122 \u2212 5 4 un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121 + 15 8 unj +O( t, x t, x3)\nu\u0302n,(1) j+ 12 = \u22121 8 un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121 + 3 4 unj + 3 8 unj+1 +O( t, x t, x3).\n(24)\nMore precisely, there are terms in the truncation error that depend upon t . On relating t \u223c xr , the interpolants with delays reduce to first order when r = 1 (convective CFL) and to second order when r = 2 (diffusive CFL). The convex combination of the three interpolants with ideal weights \u03b3i also has a leading order truncation term that scales as O( t), thereby degrading the order even in the full stencil, i.e.\nu\u0302n j+ 12 = 3 128 un\u2212k\u0303j\u22122 \u2212 5 32 un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121 + 45 64 unj + 15 32 unj\u22121 \u2212 5 128 unj+2 +O( t, x t, t2, x2 t). (25)\nClearly, the standard interpolants cannot be used in the presence of delays. A similar degradation in order was observed when standard finite difference schemes are used with asynchrony [15] for computation of spatial derivatives. Following the general methodology to overcome this loss of accuracy in [24], the asynchrony-tolerant WENO schemes (AT-WENO) can be derived. For this, the AT-interpolant for each of the substencils in the presence of delays is computed. When multiple time-levels are used, the interpolation is two-dimensional i.e. in space and time, and thus, requires a greater number of points to achieve a given order of accuracy. Since the Taylor series expansion is used to obtain the coefficients, a relation of the form t \u223c xr is also needed to identify the overall low-order terms (in space) that should be eliminated for achieving the desired order of accuracy. A schematic representation to identify low-order terms which need to be subjected to constraints is illustrated in Figures 2 and 3 in [24]. For example, for a third-order accurate approximation, when t \u223c x, six equations corresponding to terms of the order {1, t, x, t2, t x, x2} are needed, and therefore, each candidate stencil comprises six points. Similarly, if r = 2 only four equations {1, t, x, x2} are required, and therefore, a four-point stencil is sufficient to achieve a third-order approximation. Since the stencil now depends upon the delays observed at the processor boundaries, the stencil itself is random because of the random nature of the delays. One can represent this stochastic stencil as S\u0303 . For the first candidate stencil (as shown in Fig. 2), S\u0303(0) = {u\u2212k\u0303+n\u22121j\u22122 , un\u2212k\u0303j\u22122, un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121, unj } with delay k\u0303 and r = 2, the AT interpolant is\nu\u0303n,(0) j+ 12 = 7 8 k\u0303u\u2212k\u0303+n\u22121j\u22122 + 1 8\n( 3 \u2212 7k\u0303 ) un\u2212k\u0303j\u22122 \u2212 5 4 un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121 + 15 8 unj + TE(0). (26)\nThe leading order truncation error in Eq. (26) term depends on the delay k\u0303 and is equal to\nTE(0) = \u22125 4 k\u0303u\u0307\u2032(x, t) t x + 5 16 u\u2032\u2032\u2032(x, t) x3 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u223c O( x3), (27)\nwhere u\u0307 = \u2202u/\u2202t and u\u2032 = \u2202u/\u2202x and t \u223c x2 gives the overall spatial order of accuracy to be O( x3). When k\u0303 = 0, Eq. (26) reduces to the standard third-order synchronous interpolant in Eq. (20). For the second stencil S\u0303(1) = {u\u2212k\u0303+n\u22121j\u22121 , u\u2212k\u0303j\u22121, unj , unj+1}, with delays considered only at the buffer point (u j\u22121), the third-order interpolant is\nu\u0303n,(1) j+ 12 = 1 8 k\u0303u\u2212k\u0303+n\u22121j\u22121 + 1 8\n( \u2212k\u0303 \u2212 1 ) un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121 + 3\n4 unj +\n3 8 unj+1 + TE(1), (28)\nwhere the leading order truncation error term\nTE(1) = \u2212 1 16 u\u2032\u2032\u2032(x, t) x3 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u223c O( x3) (29)\nis independent of delay k\u0303, unlike Eq. (27). Lastly, for stencil S\u0303(2) = {unj , unj+1, unj+2} = S(2) , since all the points are within the PE, the standard interpolant i.e. u\u0303n,(2)\nj+ 12 = u\u0302n,(2) j+ 12 can readily be used. The full stencil is comprised of seven points S\u0303 = 2\u22c3 i=0 S\u0303(i) =\n{u\u2212k\u0303+n\u22121j\u22122 , un\u2212k\u0303j\u22122, u\u2212k\u0303+n\u22121j\u22121 , un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121, unj , unj+1, unj+2}. With this choice of stencil, at most, a fourth-order accurate approximation can be obtained for the full stencil since the degrees of freedom are sufficient only to eliminate seven low-order terms. Extension to higher orders would require extending the stencil in both space and time. This is explained in great detail in [24] for AT finite difference schemes.\nOn evaluation of the ideal weights for this larger stochastic stencil S\u0303 i.e.\nu\u0303n j+ 12\n= 2\u2211\ni=0 \u03b3i u\u0303\nn,(i) j+ 12 , (30)\nyields\n\u03b3 = { 0, 1\n2 ,\n1\n2\n} (31)\nwhich, in turn, gives a fourth-order truncation error term in Eq. (30). These ideal weights eliminate the first stencil S\u0303(0) and reduce the full stencil to a four-point synchronous stencil in the absence of delays. If the second stencil is modified S\u0303(1) = {u\u2212k\u0303+n\u22121j\u22121 , un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121, un\u2212k\u0303j , unj+1}, the ideal weights are no longer positive, \u03b3 = { \u2212 32 ,\u2212 52 ,5 } . Further changing the third stencil to S\u0303(2) = {u\u2212k\u0303+n\u22121j , un\u2212k\u0303j , un\u2212k\u0303j+1, unj+2} such that all three stencils now have similar stencil structure and thus use four points as shown in Fig. 2, the ideal weights obtained are\n\u03b3 = { 3\n8 ,\n5 4 ,\u22125 8\n} . (32)\nThis exercise shows that irrespective of the choice of asynchronous stencil with four points, at least one of the ideal or linear weights is non-positive for integer values of k\u0303. This non-convex nature of ideal weights leads to instabilities and oscillations [39]. The procedure to deal with the non-positive weights has been described in [39] and it involves splitting all the weights into positive and negative parts,\n\u03b3\u0303 +i = 1\n2 (\u03b3i + \u03b8 |\u03b3i|)\n\u03b3\u0303 \u2212i = \u03b3\u0303 +i \u2212 \u03b3i (33)\nfor i = {0, 1, 2}. The split ideal weights are then scaled by the parameters\n\u03c3\u00b1 = 3\u2211\ni=1 \u03b3\u0303 \u00b1i ; \u03b3 \u00b1i = \u03b3\u0303 +i /\u03c3\u00b1, (34)\nwhich are used to write the split polynomial interpolations( u\u0302n\nj+ 12 )\u00b1 = 2\u2211 i=0 \u03b3 \u00b1i u\u0302 n,(i) j+ 12 , (35)\nwhich is equivalent to replacing the ideal positive weight \u03b3i in Eq. (22) by the corresponding scaled split weight \u03b3 \u00b1i [39]. However, this procedure does involve a series of additional computations to compute the derivative of the flux accurately.\nFor this particular choice of stencil with delayed data at the left boundaries, the reconstruction polynomial can also be derived using the primitive function [30]. For example, for a stencil of the form S\u0303(i) = {u\u2212k\u0303+n\u22121j\u22121+i , un\u2212k\u0303j+i , un\u2212k\u0303j+1+i, unj+1+i} where i = {0, 1, 2}, one obtains the following AT approximations,\nu\u0303n,(i) j+ 12 =1 6\n( 3i2 \u2212 12i + 5 ) k\u0303u\u2212k\u0303+n\u22121i+ j\u22122 + 1\n6\n( \u22123i2k\u0303 + 12ik\u0303 \u2212 5k\u0303 + 3i2 \u2212 6i + 2 ) un\u2212k\u0303i+ j\u22122\n+ 1 6\n( \u22126i2 + 18i \u2212 7 ) un\u2212k\u0303i+ j\u22121 + 1\n6\n( 3i2 \u2212 12i + 11 ) uni+ j.\n(36)\nThe reconstruction polynomials in Eq. (36) reduce to the traditional candidate reconstruction polynomials in [38,30] when k\u0303 = 0 for three-fifth order WENO scheme with ideal weights {1/10, 6/10, 3/10}.\nAs is evident from Eq. (22), the non-linear weights \u03c9i that are integral to the WENO formulation depend upon the smoothness indicators \u03b2i defined in [30] as\n\u03b2(i) = k\u2211\n=1 x2 \u22121\nx j+ 12\u222b\nx j\u2212 12\n( d\ndx p(i)(x)\n)2 dx (37)\nwhere p(i)(x) is the polynomial of degree k (=2, in the example considered here) for stencil S(i) . For a one-dimensional polynomial interpolation Eq. (37) can be easily evaluated to give a smoothness indicator for each stencil. However, for a simpler extension to an asynchronous stencil, Simpson\u2019s 3/8 rule is used to compute \u03b2(i) ,\n\u03b2(i) = x 6\n( k\u2211\n=1 x2 \u22121\n( d\ndx p( j)(x) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 x=x\nj\u2212 12\n)2 + 4\nk\u2211 =1\nx2 \u22121 ( d\ndx p( j)(x) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 x=x\nj\u2212 16\n)2\n+ 4 k\u2211\n=1 x2 \u22121\n( d\ndx p( j)(x) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 x=x\nj+ 1\n)2 +\nk\u2211 =1\nx2 \u22121 ( d\ndx p( j)(x) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 x=x\nj+ 1\n)2) ,\n(38)\n6 2\nsuch that the derivatives of the interpolant are computed numerically at each of {x j\u2212 12 , x j\u2212 16 , x j+ 16 , x j+ 12 } using all the points in the stencil S(i) . This yields the smoothness indicator expressed in the form\n\u03b2(0) = 1 3\n( 4 ( un )2 j\u22122 + ( 11unj \u2212 19unj\u22121 ) unj\u22122 + 25 ( un )2 j\u22121 + 10 ( un )2 j \u2212 31unj\u22121unj ) \u03b2(1) = 1\n3\n( 4 ( un )2 j\u22121 + ( 5unj+1 \u2212 13unj ) unj\u22121 + 13 ( un )2 j + 4 ( un )2 j+1 \u2212 13unj unj+1 ) \u03b2(2) = 1\n3\n( 10 ( un )2 j + ( 11unj+2 \u2212 31unj+1 ) unj + 25 ( un )2 j+1 + 4 ( un )2 j+2 \u2212 19unj+1unj+2 ) (39)\nwhich is consistent with \u03b2( j) in the literature. Extending this to the asynchronous stencil, the smoothness indicator of the following form is obtained when a four-point stencil is used for all three candidate stencils,\n\u03b2\u0303(0) = 1 3\n(( 10k\u03032 \u2212 11k\u0303 + 4 )( un\u2212k\u0303j\u22122 )2 + ( \u2212 20k\u03032un\u2212k\u0303\u22121j\u22122 + k\u0303 (11un\u2212k\u0303\u22121j\u22122 + 31un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121 \u2212 20unj) \u2212 19un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121 + 11unj ) un\u2212k\u0303j\u22122 + 10k\u03032 ( un\u2212k\u0303\u22121j\u22122\n)2 + 25(un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121)2 \u2212 31unj un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121 + k\u0303un\u2212k\u0303\u22121j\u22122 (20unj \u2212 31un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121) + 10(unj)2 ) (40)\n\u03b2\u0303(1) = 1 3\n(( 4k\u03032 \u2212 5k\u0303 + 4 )( un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121 )2 + ( \u2212 8k\u03032un\u2212k\u0303\u22121j\u22121 + k\u0303 (5un\u2212k\u0303\u22121j\u22121 + 13un\u2212k\u0303j \u2212 8unj+1) \u2212 13un\u2212k\u0303j + 5unj+1 ) un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121 + 4k\u03032 ( un\u2212k\u0303\u22121j\u22121\n)2 + 13(un\u2212k\u0303j )2 \u2212 13unj+1un\u2212k\u0303j + k\u0303un\u2212k\u0303\u22121j\u22121 ( 8unj+1 \u2212 13un\u2212k\u0303j ) + 4 ( unj+1 )2 ) (41)\n\u03b2\u0303(2) = 1 3\n(( 4k\u03032 \u2212 11k\u0303 + 10 )( un\u2212k\u0303j )2 + ( \u2212 8k\u03032un\u2212k\u0303\u22121j + k\u0303 (11un\u2212k\u0303\u22121j + 19un\u2212k\u0303j+1 \u2212 8unj+2) \u2212 31un\u2212k\u0303j+1 + 11unj+2) un\u2212k\u0303j + 4k\u03032 ( un\u2212k\u0303\u22121j )2 + 25(un\u2212k\u0303j+1)2 \u2212 19unj+2un\u2212k\u0303j+1 + k\u0303un\u2212k\u0303\u22121j (8unj+2 \u2212 19un\u2212k\u0303j+1) + 4(unj+2)2 ) .\n(42)\nEach of the \u03b2\u0303 i listed in Eq. (40), Eq. (41), Eq. (42) reduce to the corresponding \u03b2( j) expressions in Eq. (39) when k\u0303 = 0. With the approximations and smoothness indicators in the candidate stencil known along with the ideal weights, the derivative of the flux can then be computed using the standard WENO procedure.\nFor the choice of stencil discussed above, if the delay is zero then instead of achieving fifth-order approximation in the larger stencil, only fourth-order accuracy is obtained. This is explained as follows. The ideal weights {\u03b30, \u03b31, \u03b32} in Eq. (30) satisfy \u22112 i=0 \u03b3i = 1 and thus, two additional constraints need to be imposed to find a unique solution when seeking a combination of smaller stencils. Upon upgrading from a third-order approximation in the smaller stencil S\u0303( j) to a fourth-order approximation in the full stencil S\u0303 , only two lower order truncation error terms of the form { t x, x3} can be eliminated. Thus, a unique solution for \u03b3i is obtained. However, such an approximation will never recover fifth-order accuracy in the absence of delays since the x4 truncation error term is non-zero. Consequently, when there is no delay, the large stencil S\u0303 will have at most four points and the approximation is only fourth-order accurate. For example, the ideal weights Eq. (32) yield non-zero coefficients only for points { j \u2212 2, j \u2212 1, j, j + 2} in the full stencil when k\u0303 = 0. Moreover, this stencil is spatially discontinuous.\nThe reduction in the number of points in the larger stencil when the delay is zero and a corresponding lower order accurate approximation can be overcome by selectively eliminating additional truncation error terms. For an asynchronous fifth-order approximation, terms of the form { t2, t x2, x4} in addition to { t x, x3} also need to be eliminated. Since this yields a system with six constraints and only three unknowns, a unique solution cannot be determined. However, it is still possible to achieve a fifth-order approximation in the absence of delays. Addition of one more point in the smaller asynchronous stencil and using this degree of freedom to eliminate the t x truncation term does not affect the order of the resulting interpolant. However, when the ideal weights in the large stencil are computed, one of the constraints can now be imposed on the x4 term. This exercise then yields convex ideal weights that are exactly equal to the ones obtained when all three small stencils are synchronous. While the asynchronous approximation in the full stencil is still of order four, the synchronous approximation recovers fifth-order accuracy when the delay goes to zero. Moreover, a convex combination\nof the candidate stencil with none of the weights being negative is achieved. Thus, the additional computation involved in the treatment on negative weights is no-longer required. This new asynchronous stencil at the left boundary is given as\nS\u0303(0)L = {un\u2212k\u0303\u22121j\u22122 , un\u2212k\u0303j\u22122, un\u2212k\u0303\u22121j\u22121 , un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121, unj }, S\u0303(1)L = {un\u2212k\u0303\u22121j\u22121 , un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121, un\u2212k\u0303j , unj , unj+1} S\u0303(2)L = S(2) = {unj , unj\u22121, unj+2}.\n(43)\nand is shown in Fig. 3. For this stencil the third-order interpolation of the form\nu\u0303n,(0) j+ 12 = \u22123 8 k\u0303u\u2212k\u0303+n\u22121j\u22122 + 5 4 k\u0303u\u2212k\u0303+n\u22121j\u22121 + 1 8\n( 3k\u0303 + 3 ) un\u2212k\u0303j\u22122 + 1\n4\n( \u22125k\u0303 \u2212 5 ) un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121 + 15\n8 unj\nu\u0303n,(1) j+ 12 = 1 8 k\u0303u\u2212k\u0303+n\u22121j\u22121 + 1 8\n( \u2212k\u0303 \u2212 1 ) un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121 + 3\n4 unj +\n3 8 unj+1\nu\u0303n,(2) j+ 12 = 3 8 8unj + 3 4 unj+1 \u2212 1 8 unj+2\n(44)\nis obtained when a constraint is imposed on the truncation error term t x for the first two stencils, S\u0303(0) and S\u0303(1) . The ideal weights are then computed to be\n\u03b3 = { 1\n16 ,\n5 8 , 5 16\n} . (45)\nWhile the interpolation procedure for approximating the fluxes at the edges is explained in detail, approximation using reconstruction, which is equivalent to the WENO approximation for the first derivative, is the main relevant WENO procedure when designing finite volume or finite difference schemes to solve hyperbolic conservation laws [40]. Similar constraints in terms of the order-of-accuracy and elimination of specific terms can also be used to derive a reconstruction function with an asynchronous stencil using a primitive variable. For the choice of stencil listed in Eq. (43), by treating point values as cell-averages the third-order reconstruction approximation at the left boundary assumes the following functional form\nu\u0303n,(0) j+ 12 = \u22121 3 k\u0303u\u2212k\u0303+n\u22121j\u22122 + 7 6 k\u0303u\u2212k\u0303+n\u22121j\u22121 + 1 6\n( 2k\u0303 + 2 ) un\u2212k\u0303j\u22122 + 1\n6\n( \u22127k\u0303 \u2212 7 ) un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121 + 11\n6 unj\nu\u0303n,(1) j+ 12 = 1 6 k\u0303u\u2212k\u0303+n\u22121j\u22121 + 1 6\n( \u2212k\u0303 \u2212 1 ) un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121 + 5\n6 unj +\n1 3 unj+1\nu\u0303n,(2)1 = 1 unj + 5 unj+1 \u2212 1 unj+2\n(46)\nj+ 2 3 6 6\nsuch that the coefficients reduce to their corresponding synchronous values when k\u0303 = 0. The ideal or linear weights in this case can then be computed to be\n\u03b3 = { 1\n10 ,\n3 5 , 3 10\n} (47)\nwhich provides the fifth-order reconstruction polynomial in the larger stencil when the delay is zero, and is fourth-order, otherwise. Finally, the smoothness indicator for stencil Eq. (43) is computed using Simpson\u2019s 3/8 rule,\n\u03b2\u0303(0) = 1 3\n( 4 ( un\u2212k\u0303j\u22122 )2 + 25(un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121)2 + k\u03032(4(un\u2212k\u0303\u22121j\u22122 )2 + 4(un\u2212k\u0303j\u22122)2 + 19un\u2212k\u0303j\u22122 (un\u2212k\u0303\u22121j\u22121 \u2212 un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121) + 25 ( un\u2212k\u0303\u22121j\u22121 \u2212 un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121 )2 + un\u2212k\u0303\u22121j\u22122 (19(un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121 \u2212 un\u2212k\u0303\u22121j\u22121 ) \u2212 8un\u2212k\u0303j\u22122)) \u2212 31unj un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121 + 10(unj)2\n+ un\u2212k\u0303j\u22122 ( 11unj \u2212 19un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121 ) + k\u0303 ( 8 ( un\u2212k\u0303j\u22122 )2 + (19un\u2212k\u0303\u22121j\u22121 \u2212 38un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121 + 11unj) un\u2212k\u0303j\u22122 + un\u2212k\u0303\u22121j\u22122 ( \u22128un\u2212k\u0303j\u22122 + 19un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121 \u2212 11unj ) \u2212 ( un\u2212k\u0303\u22121j\u22121 \u2212 un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121 )( 50un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121 \u2212 31unj ))) (48)\n\u03b2\u0303(1) = 1 3\n( 4k\u03032 ( un\u2212k\u0303\u22121j\u22121 \u2212 un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121 )2 + 4(un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121)2 + 13(unj)2 + 4(unj+1)2 + (5unj+1 \u2212 13unj) un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121 \u2212 13unj unj+1 \u2212 k\u0303 ( un\u2212k\u0303\u22121j\u22121 \u2212 un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121 )( 8un\u2212k\u0303j\u22121 \u2212 13unj + 5unj+1 )) (49)\n\u03b2\u0303(2) = 1 3\n( 10 ( unj )2 \u2212 31unj+1unj + 25(unj+1)2 + 4(unj+2)2 + (11unj \u2212 19unj+1) unj+2 ) = \u03b2(2). (50)\nIn terms of the leading order truncation error, these smoothness indicators have the same properties as their synchronous counterparts, and therefore, preserve the order characteristics of the non-linear weights in Eq. (21). Thus, the AT-WENO approximation in the simulations presented here is carried out using the reconstruction polynomials in Eq. (46), ideal weights in Eq. (47) and the smoothness indicators listed in Eq. (50). While only a specific example of AT-WENO is presented here, similar steps can be followed to derive high-order schemes as well by extending the stencil in both space and time. Furthermore, additional low-order truncation error terms can also be selectively eliminated in both candidate and full stencil such that the AT-WENO scheme in the full stencil reduces to the corresponding synchronous scheme in the absence of delays.\nBefore proceeding with the validation simulations in Section 5, the order of accuracy of the synchronous and the new AT-WENO schemes is tested on a linear advection equation,\n\u2202u \u2202t + c \u2202u \u2202x = 0 (51)\nin a periodic domain x \u2208 [\u22121, 1] for an initial condition u(x, 0) = sin4(\u03c0x + 0.25) and a convective velocity of c = 5 for different spatial resolutions. Since the AT-WENO scheme is derived using the relation t \u223c x2, we retain this power-law for computing the time step in the simulations to assess the order of accuracy. The temporal scheme used is RK-3 implemented using the procedure listed in section 2.3. Delays with uniform probability are introduced at every grid-point. The L1 and L\u221e norm of the error at t = 1.0 is tabulated in Table 1 for the synchronous case, standard WENO used asynchronously (ASWENO) and the asynchrony-tolerant WENO (AT-WENO). As expected, the order degrades to two when the standard WENO sees delays at the boundaries and the error is orders of magnitude larger than the synchronous error. On the contrary, the AT-WENO schemes exhibit errors comparable to the synchronous case and the order of accuracy is close to four.\nThe analysis was repeated for an inviscid Burgers equation,\n\u2202u \u2202t + \u2202 \u2202x\n( u2\n2\n) = 0 (52)\nin a periodic domain with an initial condition, u(x, 0) = 0.5 + sin(\u03c0x). The order of accuracy both before and after the formation of the shock is computed. At t = 0.15, the solution is smooth throughout the domain and the order deterioration only occurs when the standard WENO is used asynchronously (AS-WENO). Both synchronous and AT-WENO have an order higher than the theoretical order when the grid is refined. For L1 and L\u221e norm of error after shock formation, only the smooth region at a distance of 0.05 on both sides of the shock, i.e. |x \u2212 xshock| > 0.05, is considered [37]. Once again, errors in both the L1 and L\u221e norms and the order of accuracy for AT-WENO are consistent with that for standard WENO. Thus, AT-WENO exhibits expected numerical accuracy for both linear and non-linear equations. (See Table 2.)"

The effect of the source of the acoustic wave, for example from an ignition kernel, is decoupled from its propagation, and the only focus here is on whether the asynchrony-tolerant framework can accurately capture waves traversing with the speed of sound. Furthermore, if an error in gradients due to delayed data at the boundaries manifest themselves in the form of dilatational modes then one should observe these effects in the propagation of acoustic waves through larger errors. In the current problem the acoustic wave is considered to be a perturbation in the pressure field that is described with the following initial condition [43],\nu(x,0) = u0 +Aexp\n[\n\u2212B\n(\nx \u2212 x0\nL\n)]\nP (x,0) = P0 + \u03c10c0 (u \u2212 u0) \u03c1(x,0) = \u03c10 + \u03c10 (u \u2212 u0) c0 T = P/\u03c1R\n(58)\nwhere u0, \u03c10, P0 prescribe the uniform mean values, and ideal gas law is used to compute the temperature field. Here A and B determine the magnitude and stiffness of the acoustic fluctuation and x0 is the location of the fluctuation peak. This initial field is shown as a light blue line in Fig. 4 and Fig. 5. Non-reflecting inflow/outflow boundary conditions [44,45] are used and the initial fluctuation is allowed to traverse across at least one processing element boundary where it encounters delays. While at the internal points standard fourth-order central difference schemes are used, at the physical boundary points the derivatives are computed using second-order finite difference schemes. For computation of derivatives at the processor boundaries, fourth-order AT schemes are used (see Table A.13 in Appendix A).\nWhen the standard central-difference schemes are used asynchronously (AS-SFD), there are visible fluctuations in the pressure field even at early times. This is evident from Fig. 4 where both instantaneous pressure and velocity fields at time\nt = 4 \u00d7 10\u22126s show large numerical errors and clear deviation from the corresponding synchronous field. For larger delay values corresponding to Set-3 in Table 3, the numerical perturbations become significant at much shorter times and render the simulation unstable eventually. These errors are amplified even after the acoustic wave leaves the domain. However, when AT schemes are used for the propagation of an acoustic wave with delays at processor boundaries, the solution remains in close agreement with its synchronous counterpart and the errors are several orders of magnitude smaller (see Fig. 5). Similar behavior is also observed at later times when the wave is close to leaving the right boundary. Moreover, the errors in both pressure and velocity are not localized to near processing element boundary points where AT schemes are used to compute derivatives.\nThe L1 and L\u221e norms of the errors computed with respect to the synchronous simulation are defined as\nZ L1 = \u3008Zsynchronous \u2212 ZAS or AT\u3009 Z L\u221e = max ( Zsynchronous \u2212 ZAS or AT ) ,\n(59)\nwhere Z is any quantity, for example temperature, pressure or mass fractions, and \u3008.\u3009 is the spatial average. These errors are listed in Table 5 for both AS-SFD and AT simulations at two different times. The AT schemes exhibit significantly less numerical error at both times, and the error does not grow monotonically with time like it does for the AS-SFD."

            "text": "A canonical problem of practical relevance to compression ignition in internal combustion engines is auto-ignition of a premixed fuel-air mixture at constant volume. Here auto-ignition of a fuel lean H2/air mixture at an equivalence ratio of 0.4895 at an initial temperature of 400K is considered. A hot spot represented by a Gaussian temperature spike with a peak value of 1040K , which is above the ignition limit, is introduced at the center of a one-dimensional closed domain and the\nmixture eventually auto-ignites after an induction period. This thermal explosion leads to a rapid increase in temperature to nearly 2000K. Following the ignition of the hot spot, reaction fronts emanate from the spontaneous ignition kernel, one propagating to the left, while the other to the right. The gas expansion from the heat release during auto-ignition results in an induced velocity from an initially quiescent flow field. The time elapsed from the initial hot-spot to a time at which the temporal gradient of temperature or heat release rate is maximum is the so-called ignition delay time (\u03c4ign). The time evolution of maximum temperature and pressure is shown in Fig. 6. It is clear that while the temperature increases slowly initially, there is an exponential increase in the temperature at around t = 5 \u00d7 10\u22125s. The temporal evolution of the peak temperature and pressure is captured accurately by the asynchrony-tolerant schemes. Following ignition, the two fronts propagate towards the left and right boundary and are allowed to traverse across at least one processing element boundary where delays are explicitly encountered. For simplicity we consider a periodic domain that allows us to compute spectral characteristics of both thermodynamic and hydrodynamic quantities. Note that the periodic boundary conditions considered here provide a closed volume with compression heating from the exothermic reactions that lead to a gradual rise in pressure with time. This is evident from Fig. 6 where the peak pressure increases from 1 atm to 1.4 atm after ignition. The oscillatory nature observed in the peak pressure, and to a lesser extent in the peak temperature, is due to the propagation of compression waves in the closed domain that originated from the initial localized spontaneous ignition kernels.\nTo investigate the effect of delays at processor boundaries on important quantities of interest both before and after spontaneous ignition, the spatial evolution of temperature, velocity, pressure, heat release, and mass fractions of hydrogen and water are shown in Fig. 7. The time instants considered are indicated with dashed-black lines in Fig. 6. Qualitatively, no difference exists between the instantaneous values of these quantities for synchronous simulation and asynchronous simulations with AT schemes. The L1 and L\u221e norm of error computed with respect to the synchronous simulation is listed in Table 6 and Table 7, respectively, for three time instants. Also listed are the errors when the standard schemes are used\nasynchronously. Note that in this case the errors are several orders of magnitude larger than AT schemes, irrespective of the quantity. Moreover, for the former case, the maximum error in temperature is approximately 9K which can trigger reactions and result in nonphysical ignition in otherwise quiescent flow due to the strong temperature dependence of reaction rates. Such numerical errors are not observed for AT schemes even when the gradients, for example, in temperature or species mass fractions exist at the processing element boundaries.\nThe spectra of temperature, velocity and mass fraction of reactants and products, are shown in Fig. 8 and Fig. 9. The AT schemes exhibit excellent agreement with the synchronous simulations at all wavenumbers (\u03ba ). Moreover, non-physical accumulation of energy at high wavenumbers due to numerical errors does not exist which is in fact observed in Fig. 8 when the standard schemes are used with asynchrony. Hence, AT schemes demonstrate an excellent resolving efficiency in both physical and spectral space despite delayed data being used for the computation of derivatives at processing element boundaries."

To simulate this effect in one-dimension and to ensure that the AT schemes can propagate fluctuations accurately across processing element boundaries, a temperature perturbation is forced at the left inflow boundary. The initial condition, shown by the light blue line in Fig. 10, is the steady state solution obtained from the auto-ignition of premixed C2 H4/air mixture at a pressure of 2 atm. A 22 species 18-step reduced mechanism describing the oxidation kinetics of ethylene/air [46] is used. The steady solution is perturbed with sinusoidal temperature fluctuations with a magnitude of 180K and frequency 20Khz at the left boundary using an oscillatory inflow boundary condition [47,48]. As the perturbations approach the igniting front, the adjacent temperature increases as is evident from the increase in the mass fraction of C H2 O radical in Fig. 10. This induces a secondary ignition kernel to the left of the initial front as can be seen in Fig. 10 (left column). The two kernels eventually interact and as time progresses, a steady ignition front develops to the left of the initial kernel as shown in the plots in the right column of Fig. 10. This front oscillates about a mean location, with the peak temperature and pressure also oscillating in response to the incoming sinusoidal fluctuations. The AT schemes accurately capture the transient and steady state evolution of both the temperature and intermediate species even in the presence of delays at the processor boundaries. An excellent qualitative agreement between the instantaneous profiles for AT and synchronous simulations in Fig. 10 is observed. Both L1 and L\u221e norms of the errors tabulated in Table 8 and Table 9 are also reasonably small at both times."

A mixture of C2 H4/air at an equivalence ratio, \u03c6 = 0.42, T = 500 K and P = 1.72 atm is considered. The one-dimensional domain is 4 mm and is discretized with 576 grid points that are distributed across 12 processors.

The initial condition is generated using an auto-ignition case, and non-reflecting inflow and subsonic outflow are imposed at the left and right boundaries, respectively. The flame is initially located close to the\nright edge of the domain and in time propagates to the left while consuming the reactants mixture. The initial flame front, comprised of preheat and reaction zones, spans across three PEs as shown by the light blue line Fig. 11. This flame traverses across multiple processing element boundaries and the errors are computed to assess the effect of the asynchronous data encountered at the boundaries on flow and flame quantities.\nThe flame structure is invariant with time, therefore, only the instantaneous profiles and errors at the time instant when the flame approaches near the left boundary is considered for accuracy analysis. There is excellent agreement between the spatial profiles for the synchronous and the AT simulations, as shown in Fig. 11 for temperature, velocity as well as major and minor species. The drop in pressure in the reaction zone is negligibly small and thus the pressure values depicted in Fig. 11 are nearly constant. As is evident from Table 10, both L1 and L\u221e norms of the error between synchronous and AT simulations are negligibly small and as low as O(10\u221214) for some of the species. Furthermore, the flame speed computed from the time evolution of the location of the peak heat release rate is equal to 12.59 cm/s for both synchronous and asynchronous simulations. The thermal flame thickness is equal to \u03b4T = T2\u2212T1max(\u2202T /\u2202x) = 7.81 \u00d7 10\u22124m, irrespective of the delays."

The mixture with molar ratio H2 : O 2 : Ar = 2 : 1 : 7 is at an initial temperature of 305K and pressure of 6670 Pa. A detailed hydrogen/air mechanism [51] comprised of 9 species and 34 reversible reactions\nis used. A similar setup has also been used as a test case in previous studies to investigate the efficacy of numerical schemes [52\u201354]. A supersonic outflow condition is applied at the left boundary while a subsonic inlet condition is applied at the right boundary. The simulation is initialized with a shock that ignites the mixture at the left end of the computational domain. The domain length is 30 cm which is discretized into 6000 grid-points that are distributed across 100 PEs.\nThe simulation results are shown in Fig. 14 with pressure at different time instants in the leftmost plot. There is a leading shock front that compresses the fuel/air mixture followed by the induction and the reaction zones. The pressure obtained with the synchronous WENO scheme is shown in solid magenta. It is in excellent agreement with the pressure computed with the AT-WENO scheme shown in black circles and dashed lines. A zoomed-in view of the detonation structure depicted by temperature and pressure is shown in the centre plots of Fig. 14. The mixture reacts after the induction zone leading to an increase in temperature and a corresponding decrease in pressure. The mass fractions for different radicals including fuel H2 are plotted on the rightmost plot in Fig. 14. The results of this simulation show that the detonation structure is captured accurately with the AT-WENO scheme. Furthermore, the detonation velocity obtained from standard WENO and AT-WENO simulations is 1619.7 ms\u22121 and 1620.1 ms\u22121, respectively. These values are in good agreement with the detonation velocity reported in previous studies [52\u201354]. The peak von-Neumann pressure is 165.35 kPa and 165.34 kPa for WENO and ATWENO which are also similar to the previous studies. Overall, the AT-WENO schemes derived in the present study exhibit excellent numerical accuracy despite the use of delayed data at processor boundaries. Since multidimensional simulations of detonation phenomena in combustion devices face highly intensive computational resource requirements [55,56], AT-WENO schemes hold the potential of offsetting a certain portion of communication overhead associated with standard WENO schemes at large node counts, thereby leading to improved scalability."

            "text": "DNS of turbulent combustion at higher Reynolds numbers with detailed chemical mechanisms and at conditions relevant for practical devices will require efficient utilization of massive computing resources anticipated on next generation exascale machines. These simulations at scales and conditions that are currently infeasible will provide fine-grained details into the interactions between turbulence and chemistry and will provide fundamental insights into the physical processes that result in pollutant formation, flame stabilization, blow-off, higher efficiency, etc. This in turn will not only aid in the design of fuelflexible, low-emission combustion engines but also in the development of physics-based models for engineering simulations that will be used to design advanced clean engines. However, a successful transition of DNS codes to exascale machines and beyond is possible only through redesign and development of new computational algorithms in order to overcome some of the obvious bottlenecks and challenges.\nThe anticipated computing power of a quintillion (1018) double precision floating point operations per second on the exascale machine will be realized through extreme levels of parallelism with millions of processing elements (PEs), including CPUs, GPUs and FPGAs. For example, Frontier at the Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility (OCLF) will have 1:4 CPU to GPU ratio with unified memory. Despite the use of state-of-the-art low-latency, high-bandwidth communication links, the sheer number of communications will significantly hinder scaling to large node counts. To this end, efficient strategies to\nmask communications and data movement will be needed to improve scalability. The use of AT schemes at the PE boundaries for computation of derivatives accurately, despite delayed data, will facilitate further overlap between communications and computations. However, a challenge in extending the AT schemes to three-dimensions is that the derivatives of convective and diffusive terms need to be expanded in terms of derivatives of primitive variables by applying the chain rule. For example, \u2202(\u03c1ue)/\u2202x := (\u03c1ue)x = \u03c1uex + \u03c1eux + eu\u03c1x . This expansion increases the total number of derivatives that need to be computed, especially when a large number of species are involved. Alternatively, one can compute the convective and diffusive terms (for example, \u03c1ue, \u03c1Yiu, J i, \u03c4 ) from the primitive variables at different time levels as required by the AT schemes. These computations can be performed on the fly in order to avoid storing such product terms at multiple\ntime-levels. Essentially there is a trade-off between memory (data movement) and computation. Re-design of data structures for better memory coherency will also be extremely helpful since AT schemes use data from multiple time levels and can thus incur high cache miss rates. Besides these challenges, a critical first step in using AT schemes for scalable simulations of turbulent combustion on massive supercomputers is to ascertain that the numerical artifacts due to delayed data at PE boundary are significantly small and do not affect the underlying physics. The comprehensive set of numerical experiments presented in the present study specifically highlights the excellent numerical accuracy of AT schemes for compressible reacting unsteady flows.\nA key component of simulations of reacting flows even for simple geometries includes the prescription of nonperiodic boundary conditions. The NSCBC [44,45] with improvements for reacting flows [47,48,50,57] has been successfully used for these simulations. In the normal direction, the terms in the NSCBC boundary conditions are not affected by AT schemes. For example, at the outflow, one-sided schemes are used, which require only local information within a PE. At the inflow, relaxation terms are used which again do not require PEs to communicate. Since transverse and viscous terms are also included for reacting flows [47,48,50], the AT schemes can be utilized in the transverse direction for computation of all the spatial derivatives involved. Extension to corners can be done following [57] with AT schemes used wherever necessary.\nAnother advantage for using asynchronous computations on exascale machines is to leverage the high flop-rate of GPUs, i.e. throughput computing. In hybrid computing architectures, GPUs are expected to handle most of the computations, while CPUs will facilitate communications between PEs. With AT schemes, GPUs will not have to wait on the CPUs for the most updated data from the neighboring PEs. This would enhance utilization of GPUs without affecting numerical accuracy or introducing idling penalties. A similar approach has been utilized in [58] where asynchronous copies between CPUs and GPUs are used to overlap computation and data movement, but delayed data with asynchronous computations have not been used. At a compiler level, new asynchronous run-time systems that are capable of dynamic task parallelism are being developed to improve the computation-communication overlap [59\u201361]. The AT schemes, which relax synchronization at a mathematical level, can be coupled with such data-centric programming models to create highly scalable PDE solvers. Asynchrony has also been utilized in [62] for scalable resilience to soft faults. However, in [62] all derivatives are still computed with the most updated data but the computations are re-arranged to ensure maximum overlap between communication and computation. The asynchronization approach utilized in [62] coupled with mathematical level asynchrony with AT schemes can be effective in pushing the scaling wall. Furthermore, since AT schemes do not require updated data, these schemes can also be used to recover from node failures without halting the simulation altogether."

            "text": "In this paper, a series of numerical simulations that utilize delayed data at processor boundaries are presented for canonical reacting flows with single-step and detailed reaction mechanisms. It is shown that large numerical errors are incurred in physical as well as spectral space when standard schemes are used asynchronously, even for the simplest problems. To overcome this loss of accuracy, novel asynchrony-tolerant (AT) schemes are used for accurate computation of spatial derivatives with delayed data at the boundaries. These asynchronous simulations using AT schemes are compared with standard synchronous simulations and are shown to exhibit excellent qualitative and quantitative agreement. Both spatial and temporal evolution of hydrodynamic and thermo-chemical quantities are accurately captured by the AT schemes.\nFor simulations of high-speed flows with shocks and jump discontinuities, the standard shock-resolving WENO schemes have degraded numerical accuracy. Thus, following the procedure listed in [24] AT-WENO schemes are derived. However, the schemes so derived have non-convex linear weights which can lead to numerical instabilities and oscillations [39]. To overcome this, the asynchronous stencil is modified to include an additional grid-point. With this degree-of-freedom, an additional low-order truncation error term is selectively eliminated while preserving the convexity of the ideal weights. For evaluation of non-linear weights in AT-WENO schemes, asynchrony-tolerant smoothness indicators are also derived. The superior accuracy of AT-WENO schemes in comparison to the standard WENO schemes is exhibited through the order-ofaccuracy tests for linear and non-linear equations. These schemes are also used for simulation of a detonation wave which is found to have excellent agreement with its synchronous counterpart.\nA common conclusion one can arrive at through these simulations is that the AT schemes have excellent accuracy despite relaxed synchronizations at processor boundaries. Thus, AT schemes provide a potential path for highly scalable asynchronous simulations of turbulent combustion at the extreme scales promised by exascale and beyond.\nCRediT authorship contribution statement\nKomal Kumari: Conceptualisation, Methodology, Software, Analysis, Writing.
