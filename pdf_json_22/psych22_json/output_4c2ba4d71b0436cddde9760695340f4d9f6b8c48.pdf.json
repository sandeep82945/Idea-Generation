ABSTRACT Objective The evaluation of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety and insomnia in patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) during the third wave of the COVID19 pandemic in a region of northern Italy (Lombardy) and the investigation of which mental health, sociodemographic and clinical factors were associated with PTSD. Design Descriptive observational design with crosssectional data collection procedure. Setting A single Italian MFSspecific specialised and reference centre in Lombardy (Italy) between February and April 2021. Participants 112 adults with MFS. The majority of participants were female (n=64; 57.1%), with a high school diploma (n=52; 46.4%) and active workers (n=66; 58.9%). The mean age was 41.89 years (SD=14.00), and the mean time from diagnosis was 15.18 years (SD=11.91). Primary and secondary outcomes Descriptive statistics described PTSD, which was the primary outcome, as well as depression, anxiety and insomnia, which were the secondary outcomes. Four linear regression models described the predictors of PTSD total score and its three domains: avoidance, intrusion and hyperarousal. Results One out of 10 patients with MFS had mild psychological symptoms regarding depression, anxiety and insomnia, and scores of PTSD that indicated clinical worries about the mental health status. The presence of PTSD was mainly predicted by anxiety (\u03b2=0.647; p<0.001), being older, taking psychoactive medication and being unemployed. Conclusion Depression, anxiety and insomnia should be monitored in patients with MFS in order to minimise PTSD insurgence. Specific psychosocial interventions should be developed and tested for this population and adopted in clinical practice, given the relevance of mental health outcomes during the pandemic.",

Leading cardiovascular problems include the development of thoracic aortic aneurysms, valve diseases and myocardial dysfunction, which decide high mortality and abysmal survival rates.9\nMental health for patients with MFS is crucial to maximising their participation in care plans. Due to the multisystemic nature of the disease and the complexity of the care needed for individuals with MFS, this syndrome needs lifetime management and therapies.10 In this regard, understanding accurate population- based information regarding specific periods during the COVID- 19 pandemic is relevant to implementing public health initiatives and adjusting some emerging issues within the delivered care.\nIn Italy and other European countries, the third wave of the COVID- 19 pandemic (winter 2021) was a meaningful period to gather relevant information on patients with MFS, because during the third wave the patients had the possibility to be vaccinated. There was special attention to developing and sustaining services for patients with chronic conditions during this wave, because in the previous two waves services were limited due to the need to prioritise a response to patients with COVID- 19.11 In other words, information from the third wave of the COVID- 19 pandemic might be considered a proxy assessment of data gathered in a period where the management of the pandemic shifted towards a long- term response, trying to normalise the services for people with chronic conditions, such as patients with MFS.\nAlthough acknowledging the relevance for clinical practice of describing how the COVID- 19 pandemic impacted mental health, including PTSD and the psychological symptoms of depression, anxiety and sleep disorders, in patients with chronic conditions,12 the available knowledge on the specific population of patients with MFS is still highly limited as the available research mainly focused on describing the adverse clinical episodes of these patients during the COVID- 19 pandemic.6 Thus far, the literature on PTSD, depression, anxiety and insomnia in patients with MFS during the COVID- 19 pandemic is highly limited.7\u201310 This gap undermines the possibility of determining which aspect has to be prioritised in supporting patients with MFS by enhancing educational and motivational activities, accounting for data derived from context- specific descriptions. For this reason, this study aimed at describing PTSD, depression, anxiety and insomnia in patients with MFS during the third wave of the COVID- 19 pandemic in a region of northern Italy (Lombardy) and investigating which mental health, sociodemographic and clinical factors were associated with PTSD."

This estimate indicates that the enrolled sample size of 112 patients with MFS was adequate to represent the population living in Lombardy.\nEnrolled patients (n=112) were asked to complete the self- report questionnaires to assess PTSD, depression, anxiety and insomnia and provide sociodemographic, clinical and anamnestic data using a web- based application provided by the hospital that complied with the General Data Protection Regulation. The self- reported clinical or anamnestic data that the patients provided to the web- based application were verified and validated with a cross- check by a clinician who had access to the electronic medical records of enrolled patients.\n(IIT P atna).

It has three subscales, each reflective of one of the main post- traumatic stress symptom clusters: intrusion, avoidance or hyperarousal. Unwanted and distressing memories, nightmares, flashbacks, mental anguish and/or bodily response on exposure to reminders are all intrusion symptoms. Activities intended to stop the onset of unpleasant emotions, such as fear, grief or guilt, are referred to as avoidance. Being constantly agitated, furious and paranoid is a hyperarousal symptom that profoundly impacts the mood and quality of life. Total scores over 24 indicate PTSD as a clinical concern.\nPsychological symptoms of depression were assessed using the Italian version of the Patient Health Questionnaire- 9 (PHQ- 9).16 PHQ- 9 encompasses the criteria for depression with other depressive symptoms in a brief selfreport tool (nine items), and scores equal to or higher than 10 indicate sensitivity and specificity of 88% for major depression.\nAnxiety was assessed using the Italian version of the General Anxiety Disorder- 7 (GAD- 7) scale.16 It is a brief self- report tool useful for assessing the severity of anxiety in clinical practice and research. It showed evidence of validity and reliability in several contexts. Adopting a cutoff of 8 is recommended to maximise sensitivity without reducing specificity and detect clinically relevant anxiety, acknowledging that scores 0\u20134 indicate minimal anxiety, scores 5\u20139 are associated with mild anxiety, scores 10\u201314 with moderate anxiety and scores greater than 14 severe anxiety.17\nInsomnia was assessed using the Italian version of the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI),18 which is a brief, reliable and valid scale aimed at facilitating screening for insomnia in general practice. Scores equal to or higher than 14 indicate moderate insomnia, and scores equal to or higher than 22 indicate severe insomnia with acceptable sensitivity and specificity derived from several studies summarised in a recent systematic review.19"

Before performing the KolmogorovSmirnov test, each quantitative variable was examined for skewness and kurtosis. For normally distributed data, continuous variables were reported as mean and SD, whereas non- normally distributed variables were expressed using their median and IQR. Categorical variables have been compiled using numbers and percentages. The description of PTSD, depression, anxiety and insomnia in patients with MFS was therefore achieved using descriptive statistics.\nA bivariate analysis was carried out to select the potential independent variables that might have an influence on explaining the variance of PTSD.20 The independent variables were preliminary checked for possible collinearity using correlation analysis. In the case of highly intercorrelated potential independent variables, only one variable would be included based on a choice determined\nby a theoretical rationale. Only the variables showing a significant bivariate relationship with PTSD were simultaneously included in a linear regression model performed to determine which elements had an influence on PTSD. The model estimated the regression coefficients using the least squares estimate method. The regression coefficients were standardised for the reporting, and F- statistics were used to determine the adequacy of the model in explaining sample statistics. The null hypotheses of inferential tests were two tailed with alpha set at 5%. Analytics were performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows V.27 (IBM)."

Forty- seven patients (42%) reported at least one previous abdominal surgery, and 20 patients had respiratory comorbidities (17.9%). Roughly 3 out of 10 patients (n=31; 27.7%) experienced previous psychotherapy, 17 patients started psychiatric or psychological support during the COVID- 19 pandemic (12.8%) and 19 patients were making use of psychoactive drugs during the data collection period (7.1%). Thirteen patients reported at least one positive test for COVID- 19 (11.9%), and only 30 patients downloaded the Italian tracking system (27.5%). The levels of vaccine hesitancy were computed considering the answers of those with doubts about the safety of receiving the vaccine and those who did not want to be vaccinated, and vaccine hesitancy was found in 23.9% of the responders (n=26). Four out of 10 (n=43) patients reported great concerns about being infected (n=39.4%).\nPTSD and psychological symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia The mean score of the PHQ- 9 (psychological symptoms of depression) was 6.48 (SD=5.32); 15 patients (13.4%) resulted to having moderate symptoms (between 10 and 14) and 12 patients (10.7%) demonstrated moderately severe symptoms (>14). The mean score of the GAD- 7 (anxiety) was 5.59 (SD=5.05), with 11 patients (9.8%) exhibiting moderate anxiety (between 10 and 14) and 9 (8%) resulting to having moderately severe anxiety (>14).\n(IIT P atna).

Precisely, the study was conducted during the third epidemic wave in Italy (between February and April 2021). The third pandemic wave was a specific phase in managing the challenges of COVID- 19 where patients had availability of vaccines against the COVID- 19 infection, and healthcare systems were trying to prioritise the needs of patients with chronic conditions, such as per the MFS.21\nOverall, the levels of PTSD and the psychological symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia were consistent with those described in other populations of patients with and without chronic conditions.22\u201324 Specifically, the assessed aspects might be considered as proxies of mental health, and one out of 10 patients with MFS in the specific setting of the investigation (Lombardy, Italy) suffered from moderate psychological symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia, and exhibited clinical concerns regarding PTSD. These results confirm the triple global public mental health challenge posed by the COVID- 19 pandemic, as it is pivotal in preventing an associated rise in mental disorders and decline in mental well- being across populations, especially patients with frailty, safeguarding those with previous mental disorders from COVID- 19 and\noffering suitable public mental health interventions.25 In this scenario, specific public mental health interventions are also required for patients with MFS due to poor mental health outcomes assessed through PTSD, depression, anxiety and insomnia and are expected within the range of 10%\u201320%, based on the results of this study.\nIt is plausible that hyperarousal symptoms might account for the strong contribution of anxiety in determining PTSD. Additionally, the cross- sectional design did not allow the researchers to perform additional analyses to track the changes and the inter- relationship between anxiety and hyperarousal symptoms over time. Overall, the current study portrayed that what mainly influenced PTSD was the presence of higher anxiety scores. This information completes the descriptive data sustaining the need for public mental health interventions, as these interventions might focus primarily on reducing anxiety levels in patients with MFS. For this reason, some approaches corroborated by research in other chronic populations26 should be tested among patients with MFS and implemented in practice. In other words, there is a double challenge: one for researchers and one for clinicians. On the one hand, researchers should determine which set of psychosocial and public interventions is more effective in\n(IIT P atna).

On the other hand, clinicians have to start working on integrating psychosocial and public interventions in the daily clinical activities of MFS clinics. The possible strategies described in other chronic populations26 include a wide range of evidence- based possibilities,27 which might be summarised in generic approaches, such as the therapeutic alliance, the clinician\u2019s empathy and the patient\u2019s aspirations, and theory- driven approaches, such as cognitive\u2013behavioural therapy.28\nSpecific attention should be paid to older patients, non- active workers (retired or unemployed) and patients already treated with psychoactive drugs, indicating that they have a pre- existing psychological/psychiatric condition. These individual- level characteristics seem to be associated with frailer profiles showing higher levels of PTSD. Therefore, greater attention to screening mental health outcomes and planning interventions is required in these specific subgroups of patients."

            "text": "There are some limitations that require to be considered when interpreting the results from this study. Although the sample size was sufficient to reflect the MFS community in Lombardy adequately, the sampling process was based on a single- centre data collection approach; therefore, caution is required when generalising the results in populations different from the one represented in this study. Another limitation is due to the uncontrolled impact of some potentially unmeasured characteristics, such as health engagement, health literacy and self- efficacy. The most important limit regards the cross- sectional data collection, as no longitudinal trajectories are available to define the measured constructs over time. For instance, patients treated with psychoactive drugs in this study were associated with higher levels of PTSD; however, it is reasonable that symptomatic patients receiving proper treatment might report a steady or improving longitudinal curve over time."

For this reason, more studies on the specific population of patients with MFS are required to gather an in- depth epidemiological description of mental health outcomes in this rare genetic disease. Clinicians should pay great attention to the mental health of patients with higher levels of anxiety, who are older and non- active workers (retired or unemployed) and who are already treated with psychoactive drugs. Psychosocial and public interventions should be specifically tested in this population and implemented in clinical practice to prevent PTSD and psychological symptoms of depression, anxiety and insomnia in patients with MFS and optimise their mental health.\nAcknowledgements The authors express their gratitude to all of the patients who accepted to be enrolled in the study.\nContributors NU is the primary author and was responsible for the first and all subsequent drafts of this study.
