Previous studies have suggested that the reason for the low efficacy of\nimmunotherapy and the relapse of the original responders over time may be due to the complex network of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs), a\npopulation of multipotent progenitor cells existing in a variety of tissues. Cancer-associated MSCs (CA-MSCs) have already been isolated from various\ntypes of tumors and are characterized by their vigorous pro-tumorigenic functions. Although the roles of CA-MSCs from different sources vary widely,\ntheir origins are still poorly understood. Current evidence suggests that when local resident or distally recruited MSCs interact with tumor cells and other\ncomponents in the TME, \u201cna\u00efve\u201d MSCs undergo genetic and functional changes to form CA-MSCs. In this review, we mainly focus on the multiple roles of CA-\nMSCs derived from different sources, which may help in elucidating the formation and function of the entire TME, as well as discover innovative\ntargets for anti-cancer therapies.\nKEYWORDS\ntumor microenvironment, heterogeneity, cancer-associated mesenchymal stem/ stromal cells, stemness, immune cells\nIntroduction\nThe International Society for Cellular Therapy issued a set of minimal standards for the recognition of mesenchymal stem/stromal cells (MSCs) in 2006 based on three principles: Firstly, in typical culture settings, MSCs must adhere to the plastic. Secondly, it is essential that MSCs express CD105, CD90 and CD73, while they must be negative for CD 45, CD 34, CD 14 or 11b, CD 79a or 19, and HLA-DR. Lastly, MSCs are capable of differentiating into adipocytes, chondrocytes, and osteoblasts under certain circumstances (1\u20133). In healthy tissues, MSCs play a key role in wound healing and immune regulation. In the bone marrow niche, MSCs play an important role in hematopoietic stem cell maintenance and lineage determination by secreting factors, and contribute to the construction of the niche\nfrontiersin.org01\n(4). Although MSCs account for a relatively small proportion of the tumor microenvironment (TME), with studies reporting that they make up 0.01\u20135% of the total cell population, they can amplify their effects by directly altering the matrix composition of the TME and influencing the behavior of their offspring given the capacity for multi-directional differentiation (4\u20137).\nIt has been found that MSCs that reside within tumor tissue have high tumorigenicity compared to MSCs from healthy tissue (8). In-depth knowledge of the origin, heterogeneity, and functions of MSCs is critical to understanding disease progression and elucidating potential targets for novel therapeutic interventions."

Current evidence suggests that both recruited and local resident MSCs are major sources of CA-MSCs (12)."

            "text": "Chemokines and cytokines secreted by tumor cells and the surrounding stroma have been shown to be involved in the mechanisms of migration or homing of the circulating bone marrow MSCs (BMMSCs) to the TME. It is well known that tumor-produced CCL2, CCL5, CXCL12 and CXCL16 play crucial roles in the chemotaxis of BMMSCs (13). In addition, cytokines such as PDGF, TGF-b, VEGF and TNF-a were also found to play important roles in BMMSCs homing (14, 15). For example, a study in prostate cancer showed that TGF-b1 is a key molecule that regulates the distant recruitment of BMMSCs into tumor sites (16). MSCs present in adjacent normal tissues express the homing spectrum of inflammatory signals from tumor cells, and are thus anchored in the tumor mass (17). However, the signaling pathways and underlying mechanisms by which MSCs migrate from adjacent normal tissues to tumor sites are still unknown.\nBased on evidence, tumor cells can effectively reprogram the phenotype and function of \u201cna\u00efve\u201d MSCs. Le et al. have demonstrated that ovarian cancer cells cause \u201cna\u00efve\u201d MSCs to express CD73, CD90 and CD105, while CD14, CD20, CD34 and CD45 are absent. Moreover, the levels of CXCL1, CXCL2 and IL-8 secreted by MSCs increase through PI3K/Akt, MAPK and NF-kB signaling pathways, which in turn make tumor cells resistant to chemotherapy and the differentiation of monocytes into M2 type (18). Wang et al. have shown that gastric cancer cells induce \u201cna\u00efve\u201d mesenchymal stem cells have pro-metastatic behavior by activating YAP signaling through the exosomal Wnt5a (19). Exosomes derived from gastric cancer cell cause abnormal activation of the NF-kB signaling pathway in MSCs, thus promoting the secretion of pro-inflammatory factors by macrophages and the activation of\nFrontiers in Immunology 02\nCD69 and CD25 on the surface of T cells (20). In addition to the tumor cells, the surrounding microenvironment also plays a critical role in the malignant transformation of \u201cna\u00efve\u201d MSCs into CAMSCs. For example, mononuclear/macrophage-derived TNF-a makes \u201cna\u00efve\u201d MSCs similar to CA-MSCs in their chemokine profile and ability to promote tumorigenicity in lymphomas (21). Moreover, neutrophils treated with tumor cells activate the AKT and p38 pathways in \u201cna\u00efve\u201d MSCs by secreting inflammatory factors such as IL-17, IL-23 and TNF-a, and transform them into CA-MSCs, thus significantly promoting the growth and metastasis of gastric cancer (22)."

            "text": "As one of the key stromal cell types in the tumor niche, CAMSCs have been isolated from various tumors and have been found to play an important role in tumor progression (Table 1). MSCs isolated from gastric cancer tissues (GCMSCs) promote cancer progression and contribute to tumor immunotherapy tolerance through the CXCR2\u2013HK2\u2013PD-L1 pathway (23). IL-8 derived from GCMSCs induces the expression of PD-L1 in GC cells through c-Myc regulated by the STAT3 and mTOR signaling pathways and inhibits the anti-tumor immune response (24). GCMSCs also disrupt the Treg/Th17 balance in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) by inhibiting Th17 cell proliferation and inducing Tregs differentiation, thereby impairing the antitumor immune response (25). GCMSCs reduce the frequency of infiltrating NK cells and inhibit their effector function to promote tumor growth through the mTOR signaling pathway (26). Lung cancer-associated MSCs exert strong metastasis-promoting effects by producing complement C3, which is induced and maintained by Th2 cytokines in a STAT6-dependent manner and also promote tumor metastasis and tumorigenesis by induction of EMT and stem-like reprogram (27, 28). Single-cell transcriptional analysis of MSCs in invasive breast cancer TME revealed increased expression of the COL10A1 and COL8A1 genes, as well as pro-tumor effects driven by TGF-b-related signals (29). Breast cancer-associated MSCs also promote cancer proliferation and enhance mammosphere formation partially via EGF\u2013EGFR\u2013AKT pathway (30). MSCs residing in other solid tumors also reported to contribute to tumor progression, such as pancreatic cancer, cervical cancer, colon cancer, head and neck squamous cell cancer and neuroblastoma (31\u201335). In general, MSCs residing in TME not only up-regulate the proliferation, migration and invasion ability of tumor cells and their PD-L1 expression, but also disrupt the balance between immune cells, thus inhibiting the anti-tumor immune response (Figure 1).\nBesides solid tumors, hematological malignancies also rely heavily on support of host cells, specifically MSCs (36). The development of multiple myeloma MSCs (MM-MSCs) may be the result of multiple factors, and changes may vary depending on the individual, lesion location, co-culture myeloma cell type, and cell subsets within the MSC population. MM-MSCs differ from non-diseased donors (ND-MSCs) in a number of ways, including cytokine production. MM-MSCs secrete higher levels of growth\nfrontiersin.org\nfactors such as SCF, VEGF, and IL-6, than ND-MSCs. Recent studies have shown that, compared with ND-MSCs, MM-MSCs respond to myeloma cells with increased expression of IL-10, the TNF family member B-cell activating factor, and HGF (37, 38). MM-MSCs, but not ND-MSCs, can also induce bortezomib resistance via enhanced NF-kB activity in MM cells (39). MMMSCs are spatially co-located with tumor cells and immune cells which express genes involved in tumor survival and immune regulation. Inflammatory MSCs (iMSCs) are specific for MM bone marrow. The development of iMSCs is the result of NF-kB signaling activated by inflammatory mediators (40).\nFrontiers in Immunology 03\nDifferent properties between CAMSCS and \u201cna\u00efve\u201d MSCS\nInteractions with tumor cells and other components in the TME lead to genetic and functional changes in \u201cna\u00efve\u201d MSCs (18, 41). CA-MSCs show stronger proliferation and migration abilities and have stronger tumor-promoting effects than \u201cna\u00efve\u201d MSCs. In addition, the number of G0/G1 phase cells is increased in CAMSCs compared to their counterparts in neuroblastoma, suggesting that CA-MSCs play an important role in regulating cancer dormancy. Compared with \u201cna\u00efve\u201d MSCs, CA-MSCs also exhibit different adipogenic differentiation and immunomodulatory abilities (12).\nRegulatory effects of MSCS from different sources on tumor cells\nEvidence indicates that the specific effects of MSCs on tumors\ndepend on the origin and tumor type (Table 2)."

The plasticity of cancer stem-like cells (CSCs) is one of the primary elements responsible for the heterogeneity of the TME (63). Estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer cells make direct contact with BMMSCs and acquire CSCs phenotype with increased resistance to standard antiestrogenic drugs (45). Extracellular vesicles released by BMMSCs instruct breast cancer cells to become dormant CSCs with chemoresistance capacity (46). Cancer cell-stimulated BMMSCs also create a CSCs niche via the release of prostaglandin E2 (64). IL-6 secreted by tumor-stimulated BMMSCs, enhances the stemness and migration capacity of osteosarcoma cells (47). BMMSCs-derived exosomes promote colon CSCs traits via miR-142-3p (48)."

UCMSCs inhibit the growth and metastasis and promote the apoptosis of lung cancer cells by regulating the PI3K\u2013 Akt and NF-kB pathways (51).

Additionally, our previous studies have revealed that IL-8 derived from GCMSCs could promote immune escape by inducing PD-L1 expression in GC cells via c-Myc, which is regulated by the STAT3 and mTOR signaling pathways (24). Moreover, our findings have shown that GCMSCs upregulate PDL1 expression not only in the cell membrane of GC cells, but also in the cytoplasm and nucleus. Checkpoint blocking antibodies only block immune checkpoints on cell membranes. Thus, their effects may be counteracted by checkpoints from cytoplasmic translocation (67). The accumulation of nuclear PD-L1, which is promoted by deacetylation, has been reported to activate genes involved in the immune response (68). Evidence has suggested that PD-L1 expression is linked to tumor cells\u2019 intrinsic properties (69). GCMSCs can also induce changes in PD-L1 expression by regulating the intrinsic metabolism of tumor cells (23).

Moreover, BMMSCs raise PD-1 expression on activated CD4+CD25\u2212 T cells and induce apoptosis of these cells (74). Endothelial cells were safeguarded from cytotoxic T lymphocyte-induced lysis by co-culturing with BMMSCs (75). Besides, BMMSCs help create an immunosuppressive microenvironment in tumors by reducing the proportion of Th17 cells and increasing the proportion of Tregs in PBMCs (76). Studies have demonstrated that BMMSCs can drastically impede the growth of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells through cell-contact and paracrine-dependent means (77). Moreover, MSCs not only have an effect on T cell viability and proliferation, but also impede the production and operation of Th1 and Th17 cells, while encouraging the production of Th2 cells and Tregs (78, 79).
