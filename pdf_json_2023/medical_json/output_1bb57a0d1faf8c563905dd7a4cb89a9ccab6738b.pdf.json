    "abstractText": "Durian (Durio zibethinus L.) grows widely in Southeast Asia. The pulp of the durian fruit contains carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, fibers, various vitamins, minerals, and fatty acids. This study was carried out to elucidate the anticancer mechanism of action of the methanolic extract of the fruit of Durio zibethinus (D. zibethinus) on human leukemia (HL-60) cells. The methanolic extract of D. zibethinus fruits exhibited its anticancer effect on HL-60 cells by inducing DNA damage and apoptosis. The DNA damage was confirmed by comet and DNA fragmentation assays. The methanolic extract of D. zibethinus fruits has been shown to cause cell cycle arrest in HL-60 cells during the S phase and G2/M phase. Additionally, the methanolic extract caused induction of the apoptotic pathway in the HL-60 cell line. This was confirmed by increased expression in pro-apoptotic proteins, viz., Bax protein expression, and a substantial reduction (p < 0.001) in anti-apoptotic proteins, viz., Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expressions. Therefore, this study confirms that the methanolic extract of D. zibethinus exerts its anticancer effects on the HL-60 cell line, causing cell cycle arrest and induction of apoptosis by an intrinsic mechanism.",

            "text": "The synthesis of novel formulations of herbal medicines for the treatment of a variety of healthcare conditions is a boon for poor nations [1]. In addition to being widely accessible and reasonably priced, herbal medications offer relatively safe alternatives to conventional cancer therapies. Many medicinal plants are currently being researched for potential use as models for the development of new therapeutic agents or as innovative medicines [2]. Durian (Durio zibethinus L.), belonging to the Bombacaceae family, is grown in Malaysia, the Philippines, Indonesia, and Thailand. Durian fruit pulp is rich in carbohydrates but also contains proteins, lipids, fibers [3], vitamin C, B group vitamins, and minerals such as sodium, zinc, and calcium. The pulp is also a source of myristic acid, linoleic acid, stearic acid, and palmitic acid [4]. The medicinal properties of durian fruits include antidiabetic, anti-cancer, anti-cardiovascular [5], anti-obesity [6], and antioxidant [7] effects. The pulp of durian has been reported to alleviate symptoms of anxiety, stress, and depression [8]. Durian fruit extracts have been reported to reduce the growth of Calu-6 and SNU-601 cell lines [9] and inhibit proliferative activity in breast cancer cell lines [10].\nNutrients 2023, 15, 2417. https://doi.org/10.3390/nu15102417 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients\nNutrients 2023, 15, 2417 2 of 12\nLeukemia is a malignant tumor that affects the hematopoietic system. It causes about 30% of deaths in children [11]. Leukemia results from mutations in genes that regulate cell division, cell differentiation, and cell death. This causes the cells to shift from a normal to a malignant state [12]. Hematopoietic cancers develop due to uncontrolled growth and the accumulation of immature blasts due to blocking the progression of cells to the maturation stage. This causes a deficiency of normally functioning blood cells [13], leading to serious consequences. The cure for leukemia currently remains unsatisfactory, so natural products offer a more promising treatment option with fewer side effects. Many cancer cell lines, such as HL-60, NB-4, and Jutkat, have been used in vitro to screen the anticancer activity of compounds from natural sources [14]. The low toxicity of natural compounds has been widely used in the development of anticancer drugs. A previous study reported the antiproliferative effect of durian fruits on HL-60 cells [15]. However, the mechanism involved in the anticancer and apoptotic properties of durian fruit has not been fully investigated. Hence, in this study, we aimed to investigate the anticancer mechanisms of durian fruit pulp extract using HL-60 cells in an in vitro setting."

The endocarps of the fruits were separated and dried in the shade for about two weeks. 50 g of dried endocarp were powdered and extracted with methanol solvent (1:10 w/v) for 72 h at room temperature. The extracts were filtered using Whatman No. 1 filter paper at 45\u201355 \u25e6C under decreasing pressure. The filtrates were concentrated (ROLEX) and used for further studies [16].

            "text": "The inhibition of cell survivability due to the induction of apoptosis in proliferating cancer cells can be achieved either by inhibition of some phase of the normal cell cycle or by the induction of extensive DNA damage that leads to DNA fragmentation. Thus, cell cycle analysis through flow cytometry was performed to detect its relationship to decreased viability. A cell cycle study was performed on HL-60 cells treated with D. zibethinus methanol extract at the IC50 concentration for 48 h (Figure 1). In contrast to untreated cells, treated cells showed a significant decrease in cell numbers in the G1 phase. This was associated with significant (p < 0.05) cell cycle arrest in the S phase and some cell arrest in the G2/M phase. Cell cycle analysis indicated that 48 h IC50 concentrations of D. zibethinus methanol extract-treated cells got arrested in the S phase and G2/M phase, indicating that the initiation event may have occurred in the S phase of the cell cycle.\nNutrients\u00a02023,\u00a015,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 4\u00a0 of\u00a0 12\u00a0

Figure 2 shows pictures of the HL-60 cells stained with Annexin V-FITC, PI, and Annexin V-FITC/PI and seen under a confocal microscope after being treated with D. zibethinus methanol extract at IC50 48 h concentration. Annexin V-FITC, PI, and Annexin V-FITC/PI did not stain the untreated HL60 cells. In contrast, HL-60 cells treated with D. zibethinus methanol extract at the IC50 48 h concentration displayed strong positive staining with Annexin V-FITC, PI, and Annexin V-FITC/PI. These findings demonstrate unequivocally that, as compared to untreated cells, D. zibethinus methanol extract at the IC50 48 h concentration causes cell death even at the lowest concentration (Figure 2)."

However, D. zibethinus extract treatment in HL-60 cells induced a substantial reduction (p < 0.001) of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL protein expressions (Figure 5A,B).\nrt r, t st r l t l sis f s s - s s - , i t rs f t i , t t, t t t t ll , . i t i t t t t t\nl l i ll i , . l f\nl i l\nNutrients 2023, 15, 2417 9 of 12Nutrients\u00a02023,\u00a015,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 \u00a0 of\u00a0 12\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure\u00a05.\u00a0Effect\u00a0of\u00a048\u00a0h\u00a0of\u00a0treatment\u00a0on\u00a0the\u00a0apoptotic\u00a0marker\u00a0expression.\u00a0(A)\u00a0Blot\u00a0bands\u00a0of\u00a0protein\u00a0 expression\u00a0of\u00a0Bcl-2,\u00a0Bcl-xL,\u00a0Bax,\u00a0Caspase-9,\u00a0and\u00a0Caspase-3\u00a0 in\u00a0untreated\u00a0and\u00a0D.\u00a0zibethinus\u00a0extracttreated\u00a0HL-60\u00a0 cells.\u00a0 The\u00a0 protein\u00a0 density\u00a0 of\u00a0 (B)\u00a0 Bcl-2,\u00a0 Bcl-xL\u00a0 and\u00a0 Bax,\u00a0 and\u00a0 (C)\u00a0 Caspase-9,\u00a0 and\u00a0 Caspase-3\u00a0were\u00a0quantified\u00a0relative\u00a0to\u00a0\u03b2-Actin,\u00a0used\u00a0as\u00a0an\u00a0internal\u00a0control.\u00a0Values\u00a0are\u00a0mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0S.E.\u00a0of\u00a0 three\u00a0individual\u00a0experiments.\u00a0**\u00a0Values\u00a0are\u00a0statistically\u00a0significant\u00a0at\u00a0p\u00a0<\u00a00.001\u00a0relative\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0control.\u00a0\n4.\u00a0Discussion\u00a0 In\u00a0 the\u00a0 recent\u00a0 past,\u00a0 there\u00a0 has\u00a0 been\u00a0 an\u00a0 increased\u00a0 interest\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 search\u00a0 for\u00a0 natural\u00a0 sources\u00a0of\u00a0anticancer\u00a0compounds.\u00a0Therefore,\u00a0various\u00a0plants\u00a0have\u00a0been\u00a0identified\u00a0that\u00a0contain\u00a0anticancer\u00a0compounds.\u00a0Current\u00a0treatments\u00a0for\u00a0cancer\u00a0include\u00a0chemotherapy\u00a0and\u00a0radiotherapy.\u00a0Chemotherapy,\u00a0however,\u00a0remains\u00a0one\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0standard\u00a0treatments,\u00a0although\u00a0it\u00a0 is\u00a0associated\u00a0with\u00a0deleterious\u00a0side\u00a0effects.\u00a0One\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0problems\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0treatment\u00a0of\u00a0cancer\u00a0 is\u00a0the\u00a0emergence\u00a0of\u00a0drug\u00a0resistance\u00a0in\u00a0cancer\u00a0cells\u00a0[14].\u00a0Many\u00a0anti-cancer\u00a0drugs\u00a0are\u00a0obtained\u00a0 from\u00a0 natural\u00a0 sources\u00a0 or\u00a0 by\u00a0 derivatization\u00a0 of\u00a0 compounds\u00a0 from\u00a0 natural\u00a0 sources\u00a0 [20,21].\u00a0 These\u00a0compounds\u00a0have\u00a0the\u00a0advantage\u00a0of\u00a0being\u00a0effective\u00a0at\u00a0different\u00a0phases\u00a0of\u00a0cancer\u00a0 and\u00a0acting\u00a0on\u00a0multiple\u00a0molecular\u00a0targets,\u00a0thereby\u00a0activating\u00a0multiple\u00a0cellular\u00a0pathways\u00a0"

            "text": "In the recent past, there has been an increased interest in the search for natural sources of anticancer compounds. Therefore, various plants have been identified that contain anticancer compounds. Current treatments for cancer include chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Chemotherapy, however, remains one of the standard treatments, although it is associated with deleterious side effects. One of the problems in the treatment of cancer is the emergence of drug resistance in cancer cells [14]. Many anti-cancer drugs are obtained from natural sources or by derivatization of compounds from natural sources [20,21]. These compounds have the advantage of being effective at different phases of cancer and acting on multiple molecular targets, thereby activating multiple cellular pathways [22].\nNutrients 2023, 15, 2417 10 of 12\nAlthough plant-derived compounds are the main sources of anticancer drugs, only a small fraction of them have been evaluated for their anticancer activity and mechanisms of action [14]. Over the years, different cell lines have been used as established models for screening the anticancer activity of compounds from natural sources [14]. These cell lines serve as models to evaluate the cytotoxic properties of anticancer compounds and their mechanisms of action [23]. Various leukemia cell lines (HL-60, U937, and THP-1) have been used as models for in vitro screening of compounds with anticancer activity. Earlier studies by [15] demonstrated the anticancer potential of durian fruit (Durio zibethinus) pulp extracts on HL-60 cell lines. The cell cycle involves orchestrated events that result in the duplication of the cell\u2019s genome, its growth, and finally cell division [24]. The order, integrity, and fidelity of the cell cycle are maintained by various checkpoints in the cell cycle [25]. These ensure cell size growth, the replication of DNA, chromosomal integrity, and segregation during mitosis. Thus, cell cycle arrest is a mechanism for the tumor cell to repair its damaged DNA. Therefore, the abrogation of cell cycle checkpoints before the DNA is repaired can activate apoptosis, causing cell death [26]. The present study indicates that the anticancer effect of Durio zibethinus fruit extract is exerted by activating apoptosis and arresting the cell cycle in the S phase and in the G2/M phase. This cell cycle arrest may have been triggered by mitochondrial dysfunction [27]. In the present study, D. zibethinus pulp extracts were shown to induce apoptosis, which was confirmed by Annexin V-FITC and PI staining. This induction of apoptosis may be attributed to the presence of flavonoids in the extracts [14,15]. Flavonoids show anticancer properties, both in vivo and in vitro, which also include antileukemic activities [11]. Inhibition of the proliferation of cancer cells is the consequence of stimulation of apoptosis and disruption of the cell cycle [28]. Apoptosis is a coordinated process involving the synergistic and opposing actions of several oncogenes and oncoproteins. It can be triggered by an intrinsic pathway caused by mitochondrial membrane permeation or an extrinsic pathway, which is the binding of death receptors to their ligands. Induction of the apoptotic pathway is one of the strategies for cancer treatment. In this study, the methanolic extract of D. zibethinus fruit pulp appeared to trigger apoptosis by triggering the intrinsic pathway. The intrinsic apoptotic pathway involves the activation of Caspase-9, which, in turn, activates caspase 3. Therefore, Western blotting was carried out to confirm the activation of caspases 9 and 3. The methanolic extract of D. zibethinus fruit pulp caused a significant enhancement in Caspase-9 and -3, along with the Bax protein, which is a pro-apoptotic protein. This confirmed that the methanolic extract of D. zibethinus fruit pulp caused the induction of an intrinsic apoptotic pathway in HL-60 cells. On the other hand, treatment with D. zibethinus extract in HL-60 cells caused a significant reduction (p < 0.001) in the expression of anti-apoptotic Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL proteins. The induction of apoptosis by the fruit extracts of D. zibethinus may be attributed to their polyphenol content [15]. Polyphenols have been reported to induce apoptosis and inhibit the growth of cancer cells [29\u201331]. DNA fragmentation occurs during the late stages of apoptosis [32]. DNA fragmentation is caused by the activation of cellular nucleases, which are activated during apoptosis [33]. In this study, the methanolic extract of D. zibethinus fruit pulp caused apoptosis in HL-60 cells. Apoptosis-inducing factor I (AIF I) is a protein present in the inter-mitochondrial space. Apoptosis results in the proteolysis of AIF I. AIF is then translocated to the nucleus, where it causes chromatin condensation and DNA degradation in a Caspase-independent manner [34]. In this study, the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential may be responsible for the release of AIF I, which, in turn, would cause DNA damage.\nNutrients 2023, 15, 2417 11 of 12"
