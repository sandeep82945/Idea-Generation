    "abstractText": "Cochrane is an international network, registered as a not-forprofit organization that collaborates to produce trusted, highquality, synthesized evidence: Systematic Reviews, that are published in the Cochrane Library. Cochrane works freely, unconstrained by commercial or financial interests. Cochrane evidence provides a powerful tool to enhance healthcare knowledge and decision-making. The Cochrane Neurological Sciences Field highlights Systematic Reviews of neurological interest published or updated in the Cochrane Library, making these reviews accessible to all and advocating for their use by the neurological community. In this edition of \u201cNeurological Sciences\u201d, Journal of the Societ\u00e0 Italiana di Neurologia, we are launching the Cochrane Neurological Sciences Field Corner. Our Corner will be published every three months and will contain the summary of a review of interest in the area of neurology, with the aim of promoting and disseminating the results of neurological reviews. The review summary characteristics will be: practical interest, relevance and substantiality. For our first Corner we have chosen the topic of ALS and include the systematic review summary: \u201cTreatment for sialorrhea (excessive saliva) in people with motor neuron disease/amyotrophic lateral sclerosis\u201d.
