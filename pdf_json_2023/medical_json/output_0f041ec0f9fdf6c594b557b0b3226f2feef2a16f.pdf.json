However, the therapeutic effects remain limited due to therapy resistance. Thus, a more comprehensive understanding of the roles of CD4+ T cells and B cells is crucial for more robust development of cancer immunotherapy.\nMethods: In this study, we examined immune responses and effector functions of CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and B cells infiltrating in OSCC lesions using singlecell RNA sequencing analysis, T cell receptor (TCR) and B cell receptor (BCR) repertoire sequencing analysis, and multi-color immunofluorescence staining. Finally, two Kaplan-Meier curves and several Cox proportional hazards models were constructed for the survival analysis.\nResults: We observed expansion of CD4+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) expressing granzymes, which are reported to induce cell apoptosis, with a unique gene expression patterns. CD4+ CTLs also expressed CXCL13, which is a B cell chemoattractant. Cell\u2013cell communication analysis and multi-color immunofluorescence staining demonstrated potential interactions between\nfrontiersin.org01\nFrontiers in Immunology\nCD4+ CTLs and B cells, particularly IgD- CD27- double negative (DN) B cells. Expansion of CD4+ CTLs, DN B cells, and their contacts has been reported in T and B cell-activated diseases, including IgG4-related disease and COVID-19. Notably, we observed upregulation of several inhibitory receptor genes including CTLA-4 in CD4+ CTLs, which possibly dampened T and B cell activity. We next demonstrated comprehensive delineation of the potential for CD8+ T cell differentiation towards dysfunctional states. Furthermore, prognostic analysis revealed unfavorable outcomes of patients with a high proportion of CD4+ CTLs in OSCC lesions.\nConclusion: Our study provides a dynamic landscape of lymphocytes and demonstrates a systemic investigation of CD4+ CTL effects infiltrating into OSCC lesions, which may share some pathogenesis reported in severe T and B cell-activated diseases such as autoimmune and infectious diseases.\nKEYWORDS\noral squamous cell carcinoma, CD4+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes, CTLA-4, T cell dysfunction, CXCL13, double negative B cells"

            "text": "Cancer immunotherapy has revolutionized the treatment environment. The two principal treatment modalities are immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy and adoptive cell therapy represented by chimeric antigen receptor-T cell therapy. Both therapies share a mutual objective, namely eradicating cancer cells and improving prognosis by activating cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), particularly the CD8+ CTL subpopulation. These therapies have demonstrated substantial efficacy in patients who are refractory to existing therapies.\nOral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) is a heterogeneous epithelial tumor without a substantial increase in the overall survival rate over the past decade, largely because of its high propensity for local invasion and recurrence (1). Although evidence supports adjuvant chemoradiation for high-risk individuals, recurrence remains prevalent and disease-related death is considerable, even at early time points. Similar to other solid tumors, programmed cell death protein 1 (PD-1) inhibitors nivolumab and pembrolizumab have been approved for patients with recurrent/metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinomas including OSCC. Furthermore, the application of neoadjuvant immunotherapy, nivolumab, and cytotoxic T-lymphocyteassociated protein 4 (CTLA-4) inhibitor ipilimumab prior to surgical intervention has recently been recognized to be a feasible treatment (2). Several reports on the influence of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) genetic factors and some antigenic peptides recognized by CTLs in OSCC suggest the effectiveness of these immunotherapies. However, regardless of various ongoing efforts to improve treatment outcomes, the therapeutic effect is limited because a fraction of patients remains non-responsive or quickly become resistant, and a certain rate of hyper-progression occurs (3). Consequently, while current studies about tumor immunity have\n02\nprimarily focused on CD8+ T cells and tumor cells, especially in OSCC, a more comprehensive understanding that is not confined to these cell types is crucial for more robust development of cancer immunotherapy.\nIn addition to CD8+ T cells, the pivotal role of CD4+ T cells in instigating and maintaining effective tumor immunity has been gaining recognition, even in the context of cancer immunotherapies tailored to induce a CD8+ CTL response (2). Recently, Kruse et al. demonstrated that CD4+ effector T cells are inclined to infiltrate the invasive front of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class Ideficient tumors that may escape eradication mediated by CD8+ CTLs (4). This substantial discovery elucidates how CD4+ T cells indirectly eradicate tumor cells through collaboration with tumorassociated myeloid cells and stimulation of innate immune cells. In fact, several studies have provided evidence associating expression of MHC class II in tumor cells with favorable outcomes of many cancer types (5\u20137).\nApart from T cells, mounting evidence suggests that B cells infiltrating tumor lesions and antibodies produced by plasma cells play a crucial role in tumor immunity. This is notably supported by Roei et al. who comprehensively demonstrated that tumor-reactive antibodies are produced by both germline-encoded autoreactive antibody-secreting cells (ASCs) and ASCs which underwent somatic hypermutations (SHMs) and affinity maturation (8). Despite the controversy surrounding their role in tumor immunity, a comprehensive understanding of B cells and the ant ibod ies they produce remains ind i spensab le for OSCC treatment.\nIn this study, we found that specific subsets of CD4+ T cells, notably CD4+ CTLs, expand in OSCC by high-throughput sequencing and quantitative imaging. We have previously identified these subsets as pivotal contributors to the establishment of specific disease milieus such as systemic\nfrontiersin.org\nsclerosis, IgG4-related disease, and COVID-19 (9\u201311). While expansion of tumor neoantigen-specific CD8+ T cells, which contribute to cancer eradication, has been previously reported in other cancer types, we found that the sum of CD4+ T cells, B cells, and ASCs in OSCC was similar to CD8+ T cells, and CD4+ CTLs and activated B cells were the main CD45+ immune cells. Notably, CD4+ CTLs also expressed multiple kinds of inhibitory receptor (IR) genes, such as PDCD1, CTLA4, LAG3, and HAVCR2, and exhibited co-expression modules analogous to CD4+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), suggesting that they eliminate tumor cells via cytotoxic activity and act as immunosuppressor cells.\nFurthermore, we found that CD4+ CTLs expressed C-X-C motif chemokine ligand 13 (CXCL13), a B cell chemoattractant, and physically interacted with activated B cells in tumor lesions. These activated B cells included a population of DN B cells that we have previously reported to be a disease-related B cell population that arises from the extrafollicular B cell response and are readily induced in the altered inflammatory milieu.\nOur results indicate that CD4+ CTLs might be as pivotal to tumor immunity as CD8+ CTLs, and that CD4+ CTLs also interact with B cells through physical conjugation. This study provides a comprehensive landscape of the dynamics of T and B cells induced in OSCC lesions, potentially revealing some similarities with the pathogenesis of severe T and B cell-activated diseases such as autoimmune and infectious diseases."

Subsequent gene expression analysis and cell clustering were performed in the R 4.2.0 environment using the Seurat 4.3.0 package (12).\nBefore commencing the analysis, the gene expression data were first filtered based on the following criterion: cells exhibiting more than 15% mitochondrial RNA, fewer than 100 gene counts, and\nfrontiersin.org\nfewer than 200 gene types were considered lysed and removed from the dataset. The scRNA-seq gene expression data were normalized using the sctransform (SCT) method, and the respective expression data from the three patients were integrated to correct the batch effects. Dimensionality reduction of the gene expression matrix was performed using principle complement analysis (PCA), and visualization was achieved through uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) dimensionality reduction (13).\nA k-nearest neighbor graph was constructed based on the PCA results, and cell clusters were identified using Louvain algorithm (14). The leukocyte phenotypes were then assigned to these clusters using the following marker genes: CD79A, MS4A1, CD19 for B cells; CD79A, SDC1, XBP1, JCHAIN for ASCs; CD3E, CD4, IL7R for CD4+ T cells; CD3E, CD8A for CD8+ T cells; TPSAB1, CPA3 for mast cells; CD14, CD68, AIF1 for macrophages; IFIT1, MX2 for neutrophils; NCAM1 for NK cells; CD4, CLEC4C, IL3RA for plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs); TRGV9, CD3E for gd T cells. T cells and B cells were extracted and re-clustered using the pipeline mentioned above. Quality control measures were implemented to minimize the potential doublet in both T cells and B cells. For CD4+ T cells, any cells expressing CD19, CD79A, MS4A1, CD8A, CD14 or AIF1 were removed. Similarly, in CD8+ T cells, cells expressing CD19, CD79A, MS4A1 CD4, CD14 and AIF1 were excluded. Finally, for B cells, any cells expressing CD3E, CD4, CD8A, CD14 or AIF1 were removed. This process ensured the purity and accuracy of the selected T cells and B cells for further analysis.\nSubsequently, T cell subsets were assigned based on the following criteria: central memory T cell (TCM) exhibited high expression of SELL and CCR7, while effector memory T cell expressed low SELL and CCR7; expression of PDCD1, CTLA4, LAG3 and ENTPD1 for CD8+ exhausted T cell; expression of GZMA CD4+ CTL; expression of FOXP3, IL2RA for regulatory T cell; expression of TRBV20-1 for mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cell expressed; low expression of PDCD1, CTLA4, LAG3 but high expression of GZMB for CD8+ CTL; expression ofMKI67, CCNA2 and CCNB2 for proliferating T cell.\nB cell subsets were assigned using the following criteria: high expression of IGHD and negative expression of CD27 for na\u00efve B cell; expression of CD27, negative expression of IGHD and low expression of CCR7 and CD40 for memory B cell; high expression of CCR7 and CD40 for activated B cell; negative expression of CD27 and IGHD for double negative (DN) B cell; positive expression of BCL6, AICDA, MEF2B and STMN1 for germinal center (GC) B cell; high expression of IGHG1 and IGHG3 for IgG ASC; high expression of IGHA1 and IGHA2 for IgA ASC."

T cells or B cells with identical amino acid sequence in the CDR3 region were regarded as the same clonotype. Subsequently, the counts of identical expanded clonotypes representing clonal expansion among these clonotypes were computed and divided into six levels for T cells: Single: only one count per clonotype; Small: no more than three counts per clonotype; Medium: no more than 15 counts per clonotype; Large: no more than 50 counts per clonotype; Hyperexpanded: more than 50 counts per clonotype; NA: ab TCR sequence was undetected, and six levels for B cells: Single: only one count per clonotype; Small: no more than three counts but more than one count per clonotype; Medium: no more than five counts but more than three counts per clonotype; Large: no more than ten counts but more than five counts per clonotype; Hyperexpanded: more than ten counts per clonotype; NA: BCR sequence was undetected. These different levels of counts of identical expanded clonotypes were visualized using the coordinates of UMAP derived from gene expression analysis conducted above.\nChord diagrams were employed to visualize the TCR interconnectivity among the distinct subsets. The counts of shared clonotypes between distinct CD4+ and/or CD8+ T cell subsets assigned in the gene expression analysis and unique clonotypes of these distinct T cell subsets were computed to construct a matrix for visualization. This visualization using chord diagrams was conducted using the circlize v0.4.15 package (16), where a chord connecting two different subsets represented shared clonotypes and the thicker these chords were, the greater counts of shared clonotypes the two subsets had. The counts of these unique clonotypes grouped by different CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and B cells were also visualized using bar plots.\nThe diversity of these distinct subsets in CD4+ T cells, CD8+ T cells and B cells was estimated by five metrics: Shannon, inverse Simpson, Chao1 and inverse Pielou\u2019s measure of species evenness (17\u201320). The Shannon Diversity Index was calculated using the following process: 1) count the total number of clonotypes (N), and the total number of TCR/BCR sequences in each clonotype (n). 2) calculate the proportion of each clonotype (pi) in the community via dividing n by N. 3) calculate the Shannon Diversity Index using the formula: -sum (pi * ln(pi)). The inverse Simpson Index was calculated using the formula: 1/sum (pi^2) and the Pielou Index was calculated by dividing the Shannon Diversity Index by the natural logarithm of the total clonotypes count. The Chao1 Index was calculated using the following process: 1) count the total number of clonotypes (N). 2) determine the number of clonotypes with single (n1) or double (n2) TCR/BCR sequence. 3) calculate the Chao1 Index using the formula: N + [n1(n1 - 1)]/[2 * (n2 + 1)].\nIn addition, MiXCR v4.0 (21) was used to calculate the frequency of somatic hypermutations (SHMs). An alignmentguided consensus algorithm was employed to reconstruct the BCR amino acid sequences and identify SHMs from the input of BCR nucleotide sequences. Subsequently, each mutation flagged by the algorithm employed to calculate the SHM frequency via dividing the mutation amino acid by the total number of amino acids.

Finally, gene dynamic plots were produced using the ggplot2 v3.4.1 package, the average gene expression of specific genes in cells with identical pseudotime was calculated and these dot plots were visualized by the pseudotime order of these cells and colored by distinct subsets.\nThe RNA velocity analysis was performed using velocyto v0.17 and velocyto.R v0.6 package (24). The alignment bam files and barcode information of the three OSCC samples generated from 10x cellranger software were used as input data for velocyto, which is a command line tool.

We then assigned immune cell types to distinct clusters based on leukocyte phenotype genes (Supplementary Figures 2, 3). The types of infiltrated immune cells identified included T cells, B cells, ASCs, natural killer cells, macrophages, pDCs, neutrophils, and mast cells.\nWe extracted the T cells and performed further cell clustering analysis (Figure 1D). Subsequently, we assigned T cell subset types to the clusters based on marker genes (Figure 1E, Supplementary Figure 3). A CD4+ T cell subset expressing GZMA was designated as the CD4+ CTL subset. The subset labeled TCM-CD4 + 2 exhibited high expression of CXCL13, which distinguished it from the TCMCD4+ 1 subset. The MAIT subset was identified by expression of TRBV20-1 (37). The Treg subset expressed a high level of FOXP3, whereas only the gd T cell subset expressed TRGV9. TCM-CD8+ and TEM-CD8 + subsets were assigned based on the expression levels of SELL and CCR7. Both CD8+ CTL and TEX-CD8 + subsets displayed elevated expression of GZMB. However, the TEX-CD8 + subset also expressed ENTPD1 and other IR genes. The proliferating T cell subset represented T cells undergoing proliferation and included both CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Figure 1E).\nThe different levels of TCR sequence counts of each clonotype in T cells were also visualized through UMAP (Figure 1F). Highly expanded clonotypes were predominantly found in CD4+ CTL, Treg, TEM-CD8 +, and TEX-CD8 + T cell subsets. To circumvent potential misinterpretation of novel subsets due to doublets generated during library construction, we further investigated the shared TCR sequences among T cell subsets (Figure 1G). The CD4+ CTL subset shared TCR sequences with TCM-CD4 + 2 and proliferating T cell subsets, but did not share TCR sequences with either Treg or CD8+ T cell subsets. This revealed that CD4+ CTLs were a unique subset of T cells and related to other conventional CD4+ T cell subsets, such as the TCM-CD4 + 2 subset."

However, the CD4+CTL 2 subset also expressed GZMB and other IR genes expressed in exhausted CD8+ T cells, such as PDCD1, CTLA4, LAG3, TIGIT, HAVCR2, and TOX (38). Notably, T cells in CD4+ CTL and TCM-CXCL13 + subsets exhibited high clonal expansion, low diversity and low frequency of unique clonotypes, indicating that these subsets had experienced activation and proliferation because of antigen specificity (Figures 2C, D, Supplementary Figure 5). Conversely, the TCM subset exhibited low TCR clonal expansion, suggesting a lack of antigen specificity.\nThe CD4+ CTL subset had shared TCR sequences with the TCM-CXCL13 + subset (Figure 2E), revealing a potential developmental relationship between these two subsets. Consequently, we performed pseudotime analysis based on\nFrontiers in Immunology 08\ncalculations and predictions for estimating single cell trajectories, although it would be limited in accuracy or confidence (Figure 2F). By integrating this analysis with the TCR repertoire analysis, our findings demonstrated that the CD4+ CTL subset was the most terminally developed subset among all CD4+ T cell subsets. Furthermore, the TCM-CXCL13 + subset represented an activated subset that had been presented antigens by antigen-presenting cells and potentially differentiated into the CD4+ CTL subset upon continuous exposure to antigens from cancer cells. A gene dynamic plot revealed alterations in expression of certain genes (Figure 2G, Supplementary Figure 6). During pseudotime progression from TCM to CD4 + CTLs, GZMA and CXCL13 exhibited continuous upregulation, while CCR7 and SELL displayed downregulation.

Our results indicated that the CD4+ CTL subset expressed PRF1, GZMA, and GZMB, indicating that CD4+ CTLs may induce apoptosis in tumor cells via the release of cytotoxic mediators, especially granzyme B and perforin. The expression level of cytotoxic genes in the CD4+ CTL subset, such as GZMA and GZMB, was elevated compared with that in the other CD4+ T cell subsets (Figure 2B), but did not appear to reach comparable levels with those in the CD8+ T cell subset. An intriguing observation was that the CD4+ CTL subset also expressed TNFSF10 that encodes the protein TRAIL. Considering that TRAIL and its corresponding receptor, TRAIL receptor, induce apoptosis in tumor cells, this suggests an alternative apoptotic pathway independent from granzyme B and perforin pathways.\nBecause CD4+ CTLs mediate cell death in an HLA class IIrestricted manner (40), we examined the proximity of CD4+ CTLs and tumor cells expressing HLA-DR by multicolor IF staining (Figure 3B).

A cluster of CD8+ T cells in the TEX subset had increased expression of ENTPD1 encoding CD39, HAVCR2 encoding TIM-3, and TOX, which indicated advanced exhaustion, suggesting a late dysfunctional state of these cells (38).

Many shared TCR sequences were observed among the subsets (Figure 4F), suggesting that T cells with the same clonotype existed in different cell states.\n3.7 Tumor-specific CD8+ T cells exhibit consistent differentiation to dysfunctional states\nWe performed single cell trajectory analysis of these CD8+ T cells, and the TCM subset was designated as the root of the trajectory to calculate pseudotime (Figure 4G). Together with the analysis of shared TCR sequences, it revealed that certain tumor-specific cells in the TCM subset had developed into TEM cells and ultimately to TEX cells. This suggested persistent differentiation towards dysfunctional states during tumorigenesis.\nNext, we tracked several genes using a gene dynamic plot (Figure 4H, Supplementary Figure 11), and found that GZMA and GZMB expression was continuously upregulated during differentiation. Similarly, genes encoding IRs, including ENTPD1, PDCD1, CTLA4, LAG3, and HAVCR2, showed a pattern of upregulated expression. Furthermore, TOX and TCF7, which encode two critical TFs, TOX and TCF1, during T cell exhaustion (48), demonstrated an inverse expression pattern characterized by a decrease in TCF7 expression and an increase in TOX expression. Additionally, downregulated expression of SELL encoding the integrin CD62L and CCR7, alongside upregulated expression of ITGA1 and ITGAE encoding CD49a and CD103, respectively, indicated tissue-resident development during differentiation.\nFurther insights into the cell state were achieved by RNA velocity analysis of CD8+ T cells (Figure 4I). Notably, the arrow length, which is indicative of the rate of the cell state change, was longer in several TEM subsets compared with TEX subsets. This implies a faster rate of cell state change in TEM subsets. Conversely, TEX subsets demonstrated relative stability in their cell state, suggesting that these cells had halted their development and maintained a consistent cell state."

Although DN2 and DN4 subsets failed to form distinct clusters because of their scarcity in the scRNA-seq data, their presence was confirmed by multicolor IF staining (Supplementary Figure 12).\n3.9 DN3 B cells synthesize IgG antibodies, potentially originating from extrafollicular responses, and frequently conjugate with CD4+ CTLs\nDN3 B cells showed notably high expression of IGHG1 and IGHG3, even compared with IgG ASCs (Figure 5B), and analysis of the BCR repertoire revealed oligoclonally expanded populations in activated B/DN1, DN3, and ASC subsets (Figure 5C, Supplementary\nFigure 13), whereas BCR clonal expansion in na\u00efve B cells was almost single and BCR diversity and frequency of unique BCR clonotypes was high, indicating activation and differentiation of DN3 B cells. Subsequently, we selected B cells containing more than three counts per clonotype from the DN3 and ASC subsets and visualized VJ germline gene usage (Figure 5D). Higher variability was observed in the germline gene usage of DN3 B cells compared with that of ASC subsets, indicating diverse expanded clonotypes of DN3 B cells, which was a characteristic of extrafollicular responses.\nAdditionally, we investigated the frequency of SHMs across these B cell subsets in heavy chains and light chains (Figure 5E). DN3 B cells exhibited a significantly lower frequency of SHMs compared with IgG ASCs (adjusted p-values of 6.426e-06 and 5.355e-06 in heavy chains and light chains, respectively). This suggested that DN3 B cells were activated and differentiated primarily through extrafollicular responses.\nTo further examine the potential coactivation between DN B cells and CD4+ CTLs, we performed HE and multicolor IF staining of OSCC tissue samples (Figure 5F). Conjugation between DN B cells and CD4+ CTLs was observed in extrafollicular sites adjacent to tumor cells. Such conjugation implied that CD4+ CTLs facilitated DN B cell activation and promoted their differentiation via extrafollicular responses. Conversely, DN B cells may also further activate CD4+ CTLs in these responses.\n3.10 Infiltration of CD4+ CTLs may imply a poor prognosis of OSCC\nMulticolor IF staining and quantification of CD4+ T cell subsets were conducted in 20 tissue samples obtained from patients with OSCC of the tongue (Figures 6A, B). The quantification indicated substantial infiltration of CD4+ CTLs into OSCC lesions compared with other CD4+ T cell subsets. To elucidate the potential correlation between CD4+ T cell subsets and prognosis, patients were divided into two groups by the density of infiltrating CD4+ CTLs, and Kaplan\u2013 Meier models were constructed to compare the survival distribution (Figure 6C). The results showed statistical significance in progressionfree survival probabilities between the two groups, indicating that patients with a large number of CD4+ CTLs may have a poor prognosis.\nfrontiersin.org\nConsidering potential covariates may affect prognosis, we constructed several COX proportional hazard models. Initially, we constructed singular COX models for each variable, which included the density of individual T cell subsets, age, sex, T and N classification, and differentiation of carcinoma to filter these variables. The density of CD4+ CTLs, Tregs, and Th2 and Tfh cells, as well as the N classification demonstrated statistical\nFrontiers in Immunology 14\nsignificance (Supplementary Table 3). We next constructed models that incorporated the density of each CD4+ T cell subset with the N classification (Table 1, Supplementary Table 4). A high density of CD4+ CTLs infiltrating into OSCC lesions was identified to be a significant risk factor potentially influencing progressionfree survival time, whereas the density of Tregs, and Th2 and Tfh cells did not show significant results in these models.\nB\nC D\nE\nF\nA\nFIGURE 5 Gene expression and BCR repertoire analysis of B cells.

            "text": "CD4+ CTLs play a protective role against several chronic and acute viral infections, such as HIV, Epstein-Barr virus, and Dengue virus (40, 49, 50). We previously reported identification of this non-conventional CD4+ helper T cell subset as the dominant tissue-infiltrating CD4+ T cell subset driving inflammation in several autoimmune diseases including IgG4-related disease and systemic sclerosis (11, 51). Meanwhile, research by our group and others also indicated the expansion of CD4+ CTLs in the context of COVID-19 (10, 52). In addition to their significance in these diseases, the increased focus on CD4+ T cells and CD4+ CTLs in cancer research has come about because only a minority of tumors respond to current immunotherapies including immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy. Direct cytotoxicity of CD4+ CTLs against tumor cells was initially reported in melanoma patients treated with ipilimumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting CTLA-4. Subsequent investigations have gathered\nevidence supporting the indispensable role of CD4+ CTLs in tumor immunity for other cancers, such as lung, colorectal, and bladder cancers (53\u201356). Previous studies have mainly focused on the cytotoxicity of CD4+ CTLs to establish effective immunotherapy. In this study, we revealed that many CD4+ CTLs infiltrate the tumor lesion together with CD8+ T cells. Moreover, these CD4+ CTLs possess diverse functions other than their cytotoxic activity.\nWe first identified the CD4+ CTL subset as a unique subset of tumor-infiltrating immune cells in OSCC, characterized by a distinct gene expression pattern including the expression of cytotoxic genes through scRNA-seq analysis with strict quality control, TCR repertoire analysis and SCENIC analysis. Additionally, the results of single cell trajectories, TCR clonal expansion, and RNA velocity analysis increased our understanding of the dynamic processes underlying conventional CD4+ T cell development in OSCC tissue, while it would be limited in accuracy or confidence because of results based on calculations and predictions. We found that infiltrating CD4+ TCM\nB C\nA\nFIGURE 6 Multicolor IF staining and survival analysis. (A)Multicolor IF staining of CD4+ T cell subsets in OSCC tissue.

However, the state of these cells was changing quickly. Conditions of high antigen load and prolonged antigen exposure may contribute to differentiation into CD4+ CTLs, a cell state that was more stable but represented a terminal stage of differentiation. Subsequently, we examined the potential cytotoxicity of CD4+ CTLs. We found that tumor cells expressing MHC class II molecules may be directly eliminated by CD4+ CTLs, potentially via degranulation and perforin release or activation of the TRAIL\u2013TRAIL receptor axis.\nApplication of high dimensional WGCNA to the CD4+ CTL subset revealed similarities in the expression of hMEs in modules between CD4+ CTLs and Tregs, suggesting that CD4+ CTLs likely possess immune regulatory functions despite their differing lineage. Considering that these CD4+ CTLs are the most terminally developed subset among all conventional CD4+ T cell subsets, coupled with their cytotoxic activity and potential to suppress B cell responses via CTLA-4 expression, CD4+ CTLs may mediate immunosuppression and tolerance functions in both homeostasis and inflammation.\nAn interesting finding was a module containing IR genes upregulated in CD4+ CTL, Treg, and CD8+ TEX subsets. Paired with upregulated expression of IR genes, such as PDCD1, LAG3, TIGIT, HAVCR2, and CTLA4, this result suggests that cells in the CD4+CTL 2 subset were exhausted or dysfunctional in OSCC, although contention remains on whether markers of CD8+ T cell exhaustion can be applied to their CD4+ counterparts (57). This speculation was further corroborated by high CXCL13, ENTPD1, and TOX expression, and lost TCF7 expression in the CD4+CTL 2 subset (48, 58). Considering that CD4+ CTLs are characterized as a terminally developed phenotype of CD4+ T cells and the presence of CD4+ T cell exhaustion phenotype is reported in several solid tumors, it is possible that these cells are exhausted or dysfunctional CD4+ T cells and contribute to tumor progression via immunosuppression (59, 60). In fact, infiltration of CD4+ CTLs appeared to lead to poor outcomes of OSCC patients, as observed in our retrospective evaluation of clinicopathological parameters. Chen et al. demonstrated that CTLA-4 blockade can promote the tumor immunity through a CD4+ T cell-dependent manner in glioblastoma (61). Likewise, Mccaw et al. showed that CD4+ CTLs initially delay tumor growth, but progression ultimately becomes uncontrolled, together with expression of coinhibitory molecules in murine breast tumor. Crucially, this phenomenon was reversed through anti-CTLA4 therapy (60). Both studies underscore the role of CD4+ T cell exhaustion in tumor progression and highlight the potential of CD4-targeted therapy.\nAnother interesting finding was that CD4+ CTLs expressed B cellattracting chemokine CXCL13, thereby inducing B cell migration to tumor lesions. In general, CXCL13 is typically expressed by HEVs and follicular stromal cells in the B cell region of secondary lymphoid organs. Nevertheless, several studies have reported CXCL13-producing CD4+ T cells, which have been associated with favorable outcomes of tumor immunity (62\u201364). Despite such findings, the effects of CXCL13 expression on clinical outcomes remain controversial, particularly in terms of the association between high infiltration of CXCL13+ CD8+ T\nFrontiers in Immunology 16\ncells in tumor lesions and poor clinical outcomes (65, 66). Regardless, the finding that CD4+ CTLs are predisposed to invoke B cells and mediate humoral immunity through CXCL13 expression emphasizes their central role in tumor immunity in addition to their CD8+ CTL counterparts.\nFollowing this finding, we revealed expansion of activated B cells, including DN3 B cells. DN3 B cells have been identified as extrafollicular B cells in several immune conditions including IgG4related disease and COVID-19; these conditions are accompanied by CD4+ CTL enlargement (67, 68). In OSCC, expanded CD4+ CTLs physically interacted with these DN B cells in extrafollicular regions, a scenario we have previously reported in other diseases. We observed clonal expansion and markedly higher expression of IgG-related genes in DN3 B cells. Additionally, the diverse VJ germline gene usage and lower frequency of SHMs suggested that DN3 B cells may arise from extrafollicular responses and lack affinity maturation. Considering that the affinity of IgG antibodies is likely to be low, whether the antibodies produced by DN3 B cells are associated or specific to tumor remains to be determined, which warrants further investigation.\nThese seemingly contradictory effects suggested heterogeneity in the CD4+ CTL subset. This heterogeneity may be due to the different exhausted states and origins of distinct T cell subsets (69). The question arises as to why such a specific immune microenvironment is observed in tumor lesions. A potential explanation is related with the resemblance of the tumor environment to T and B cell-activated diseases. In such environment, immune cells are constantly exposed to damage-associated molecular patterns and neoantigens, causing sustained activation of T and B cells, especially in \u2018hot\u2019 tumors. Our previous research across several disease situations, often characterized by high cytokine production and lymphocyte activation, suggests that such circumstances foster an extrafollicular response, subsequently instigating differentiation of T and B cells into CD4+ CTLs and DN3 B cells, respectively. A notable example is COVID-19, in which cytokine storms represent such a typical disease (9, 68). Research deciphering these specific immune responses may ultimately deepen our comprehension concerning the underlying immune mechanisms of a broad spectrum of T and B cell-activated diseases including autoimmune and infectious diseases. However, there are several limitations to this study. The data presented here is descriptive and suggestive of the tumor immunity mechanism focused on CD4+ CTLs. Since we examined samples from human patients rather than a mouse lab model, we could not explore the mechanism through which CD4+ T cell differentiation and CD4+ CTLs involvement in tumor immunity occurred in the patients. Furthermore, although we found several clonal expanded TCRs, we cannot identify those targets; this is one of the factors that made the mechanism challenging to ascertain in this study. Further studies should address these points.\nIn conclusion, our study indicates that expanded CD4+ CTLs eliminate tumor cells by exerting their cytotoxicity, while possibly attenuating T and B cell activity or acquiring an exhausted or dysfunctional phenotype by expressing IRs and inhibitory molecules. This suggests a dual role of CD4+ CTLs in either promoting or suppressing tumor immunity, although the latter function is more\nfrontiersin.org\nprominent in OSCC. Furthermore, we observed that CD4+ CTLs produce CXCL13 that potentially interacts with activated B cell populations, including DN B cells, through physical conjugation in tumor lesions. We employed a schema to summarize these results (Figure 7). Whether CD4+ CTLs collaborate with DN3 B cells in tumor immunity remains undetermined, despite these observations having been consistently identified in the pathogenesis of IgG4-RD, systemic sclerosis, fibrosingmediastinitis, and COVID-19. Considering the effect of CD4+ CTLs in suppressing other cancers, including melanoma, breast cancer, bladder cancer, and colorectal cancer via their cytotoxicity, whether the dual role of CD4+ CTLs we found in this study is specific to OSCC needs to be verified in the future. Our results indicate the need for further investigation into the role of CD4+ CTLs and DN B cells as potential drivers or inhibitors of tumor immunity, which could enable the development of a novel cancer immunotherapeutic strategy.\nFrontiers in Immunology 17"

CD8 + TCM subsequently differentiates into effector memory T cell (CD8 + TEM) or CD8 +CTL and expresses strong cytotoxicity. (Bottom right) Both CD4+CTLs and CD8+CTLs can induce tumor cell death; CD4+CTLs recognize the antigens presented via MHC class II molecules (MHC II) and induce the tumor cell death through granzyme B (GzmB) and perforin (PFN) release or TRAIL release, while CD8+CTLs also express Fas ligand (FasL) and recognize antigens presented via MHC class I molecules (MHC II). (Top right) Activated CD4+ TCM and CD4 +CTLs produce CXCL13, attracting CXCR5+ B cells and interacting with them via TCR/MHC class II and costimulators such as CD28/B7, thereby initiating extrafollicular responses and promoting the differentiation of B cells into antibody secreting cells (ASCs) or double negative B cell 3 (DN3). IFN-g produced by CD4+CTLs can also promote the responses. With high antigen load and prolonged antigen exposure, CD8+CTLs differentiate into CD8+ exhausted T cells (CD8+ TEX) and become dysfunctional, marked by upregulation of inhibitory receptor (IR) genes, ENTPD1 and TOX, and the downregulation of TCF7. Although CD4+CTLs display similar gene expression patterns, whether they can become dysfunctional remains controversial (broken arrows). These CD4+CTLs also express CTLA-4, competitively binding with B7 molecules and potentially limiting immune responses between CD4+ T cells and B cells.\nfrontiersin.org"
