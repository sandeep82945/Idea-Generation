Cross-lingual Discourse Parsing for DocMT: Exploring the impact of cross-lingual discourse parsing on DocMT could be a novel area. This involves developing models that can parse the discourse structure of a source text and apply it to guide the translation process into a target language, potentially improving coherence and contextual relevance across languages.

Integration of Multimodal Context in DocMT: Investigating the incorporation of multimodal data (such as images or videos associated with text) into the discourse structure to enrich the context for translation. This research direction could explore how additional non-textual information affects the translation process, especially for content where visual or auditory cues play a crucial role in understanding the context.

Adaptive Granularity in Discourse-driven Attention Mechanisms: Developing models that dynamically adjust the granularity of attention based on the complexity of the discourse structure and the specific requirements of different document sections. This could involve adaptive models that learn how to vary the scope of attention (from very fine-grained to more global) to optimize translation quality.

Exploring the Impact of Different Discourse Theories: Beyond RST, other discourse theories, such as the Prague School's Functional Sentence Perspective or Giv√≥n's Theory of Communicative Dynamism, could be investigated for their potential to improve DocMT. This research would involve comparing and contrasting different theoretical frameworks to understand how varying interpretations of discourse structure can influence translation outcomes.

DocMT for Low-resource Languages and Domains: Leveraging the proposed discourse structure-aware translation models to improve DocMT for low-resource languages and specialized domains (e.g., legal, medical, or technical documents). This could involve customizing discourse parsing and translation models to cater to the unique syntactic and semantic characteristics of such languages and domains, addressing challenges like limited available data and the need for high translation accuracy.
