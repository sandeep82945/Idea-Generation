    "abstractText": "It is a challenge to develop cost-effective strategy and design specific microstructures for fabricating polymer-based impact-resistance materials. Human shin bones require impact resistance and energy absorption mechanisms in the case of rapid movement. The shin bones are exciting biological materials that contain concentric circle structures called Haversian structures, which are made up of nanofibrils and collagen. The \u201csoft and hard\u201d structures are beneficial for dynamic impact resistance. Inspired by the excellent impact resistance of human shin bones, we prepared a sort of polyurethane elastomers (PUE) composites incorporated with rigid carbon nanofibers (CNFs) modified by elastic mussel adhesion proteins. CNFs and mussel adhesion proteins formed bone-like microstructures, where the rigid CNFs are served as the bone fibrils, and the flexible mussel adhesion proteins are regarded as collagen. The special structures, which are combined of hard and soft, have a positive dispersion and compatibility in PUE matrix, which can prevent cracks propagation by bridging effect or inducing the crack deflection. These PUE composites showed up to 112.26% higher impact absorbed energy and 198.43% greater dynamic impact strength when compared with the neat PUE. These findings have great implications for the design of composite parts for aerospace, army vehicles, and human protection.",

            "text": "During the last decades, the dynamic behaviors of composite materials have been emerging as the focus area of researchers due to complex and volatile international relations. Optimal and practical design of lightweight and high-performance impact-resistant structures is crucial for human safety, defense industry, and aerospace [1\u20133]. The high-speed impact often occurs when high-speed and high-energy shot/debris directly impact on the target, which means the flexible protective devices have excellent strength and high resilience, which can avoid penetrating damage and absorb impact energy [4,5]. With the development of advanced nanofillers and synthesizing techniques, polymeric nanocomposites have become a great level of materials of dynamic impact resistance [6\u20139]. Therein, polyurethane elastomers (PUE), a kind of flexible, superior impact-induced stiffening, and strengthening polymer, have become one of the most frequently applied materials in dynamic impact events [9\u201311]. Compared with traditional polymer-reinforced materials, carbon nanofibers (CNFs) have the advantages of high strength, energy dissipation, and excellent thermal stability under extreme working potential [12,13]. However, it is not a good strategy to add CNFs directly to PUE, which causes the agglomeration of CNFs in the matrix and decreases the mechanical property of polymer composites [14,15]. Up to now,\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3830. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano12213830 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3830 2 of 16\nit has been a great challenge to design cost-effective and impact-resistant polyurethane composites with specific microstructures. Many researchers have turned to natural biology to find optimal structures and creatively design different structures to improve their impact resistance. These impactresistant biomaterials mainly contain the following characteristics: porous, multilayer, gradient, composite, interface, viscoelasticity, and viscoplasticity [1,16\u201321]. Li et al. [19] studied how hedgehog spin worked to keep the balance between stiffness and toughness and found that these spines have a sandwich structure with an inner porous core combined with an outer dense cortex, which improves impact resistance and structural stability of composites. Zhang et al. [20] designed a nacreous structure by Al2O3-rGO/Al laminated board inspired by nacre with simultaneous enhancement of the modulus-strength-ductility. Wang et al. [21] prepared a kind of glass fiber-reinforced laminated board mixed with carbon nanotube-modified epoxy and pre-stretched fiber fabrics with excellent dynamic thermo-mechanical properties and superior impact resistance. In fact, those biological materials have excellent impact resistance due to the synergy of multiple structures rather than a single structure, leading to impressive properties under dynamic loading. Human shin bones, which contain many characteristics of impact-resistant materials, are an impact-resistant structural material with a combination of soft and hard, and they are made up of hollow mineral fibrils and organic proteins on the nanoscale [22,23]. The regular arrangement of mineral fibrils contributes to bone strength, and these 85\u201390% of proteins are composed of collagen, which play a great role in bone flexibility and energy absorption [22,24,25]. Many studies focused on the human bone structures and found that there are many concentric circle structures, which are called Haversian structures, and demonstrated that these concentric microstructures with soft and hard materials exhibit a better balance between strength and toughness, as shown in Figure 1a [17,26,27]. In addition, CNFs are widely used for bone tissue engineering applications because of their biocompatibility and splendid theoretical mechanical properties with nanoscale fiber similar to crystalline hydroxyapatite, which is found in physiological bone, suggesting that it is a strong possibility for use as an orthopedic implant material [28,29]. Furthermore, natural mussels can firmly adhere to smooth stones to resist choppy waves. It has been that the mussel foot-byssal proteins (Mfps) have superior adhesion capacity and toughness, and they are widely used in the surface modification of nanofillers [30\u201332]. Many studies on mussel adhesion proteins modified nanofillers have focused on polydopamine (PDA). However, Fewer studies on materials for cheaper and more efficient synthesis of mussel adhesion proteins. Besides, some studies found that the secret of adhesion behaviors are from Mfps, in which the catechol and amido play an essential role in adhesive behaviors [33,34]. What is more, collagen-mediated adhesion between inert surfaces is weak, Nadine et al. [35] used mussel foot protein\u20133 (Mfp\u20133) to provide a cohesive matrix for collage, which suggests the potential of Mfps for biomedical applications. In view of the excellent impact resistance of human shin bones and the potential of CNFs and mussel adhesive proteins as orthopedic implant materials, we pay more attention to designing the biological structure of the shin bone to achieve better mechanical properties and impact resistance of polymer matrix composites. Therefore, we made an exciting study on the adhesion chemistry of mussels and bone-like microstructural materials with impact resistance. Inspired by mussel adhesive proteins in mussels, we creatively chose catechol (CC) and polyethyleneimine (PEI) to bionic design mussel adhesion proteins to improve the interfacial bonding and compatibility between CNFs and PUE, as shown in Figure 1b. Besides, CNFs were regarded as tiny bone structures, and we used cheaper CC and PEI to co-deposit on the CNFs, serving as sticky collagen, which provided unexceptionable toughness and adhesive power. What is more, the CC-PEI made CNFs functionalized so that they could disperse evenly in PUE, and PUE composites with bone-like microstructures, had excellent impact resistance as shown in Figure 1c. We conducted the static compression experiment, split Hopkinson bar (SHPB) test, and dynamic thermomechanical analysis (DMA) test to measure the static/dynamic and interface problems of PUE composites, and\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3830 3 of 16\ndata exhibited that PUE with bone-like microstructures could significantly increase the energy absorption, dynamic strength, compression resilience rate, and storage modulus of PUE composites.\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 17\nFigure 1.

For one thing, the enhancement effect and internal friction of the nanofillers lead to the improvement of the E\u2019 of PUE composites. For another, the CC-PEI@CNFs can reduce the Tg, showing that the modified nanofillers enhance the mobility and elasticity of PUE chain in the polymer composites. While the CNFs/PUE show higher E\u2019 and Tg (Figure 6c,d), exhibiting the fact that CNFs only enhance the strength of PUE composites but not their toughness. The strengthening and toughening effect can significantly improve the mechanical properties of PUE and meet the requirements of impact-resistant materials.\nFigure 6.

The strengthening and toughening effect can significantly improve the mechanical properties of PUE and meet the requirements of impact-resistant materials. The data show that the PUE containing CC-PEI@CNFs present obviously higher E\u2019 and lower Tg for the entire temperature range, which is attributed to the smaller cluster size and the resultant larger interface area. In addition, the bone-like structures show good modulus and toughness and play a powerful supporting role in the PUE matrix. The surface of CC-PEI@CNFs contains abundant hydrogen bonds, \u03c0-\u03c0 bonds, and other unsaturated bonds, as well as strong covalent bonds like hydrogen bonds, \u2013NH/NH2. The addition of fillers improves the strength of the polymer and increases the flexibility of movement between chain segments. Obviously, the above results confirm that incorporating a small quantity of modified CNFs into PUE can balance strength and toughness, and these tests are favorable to the further improvement of the impact property.\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3830 11 of 16\n3.2.3. High Strain Rate Compression Test\nThe SHPB is a device capable of applying a strain rate close to that imposed by a ballistic impact of a pistol, which is the minimum performance requirement for ballistic resistance for military equipment [40,48]. The energy absorption, which is used to reflect the impact-resistance capacity of the specimens, is defined as the area under the stress-strain curve, and a larger area implies a higher energy absorption property and also superior impact-resistant properties [49]. The results indicate that the addition of CC-PEI@CNFs can affect the dynamic strength, elongation, and absorbed energy of the PUE composites. When the additional amount of CC-PEI@CNFs reaches 1.0 wt.%, the dynamic strength of CPC/PUE comes up to 374.3 \u00b1 15.3 MPa, the elongation comes up to 1.42, and is enhanced by about 198.43% when compared with the neat PUE. Energy absorption capacity of CPC/PUE\u2013V is enhanced by about 112.26%, and their surface shows tiny radial and axial crazes (Figure 7f), while the CNFs/PUE show lower elongation and complete penetration behaviors, as shown in Figure 7 and Figure S5.

In addition, there are plenty of \u03c0-\u03c0 conjunctions between the CC-PEI@CNFs, which can provide flexible bonding to move in PUE matrix to achieve enough toughness to make impact stress transfer easily and absorb the impact energy, as shown in Figure 8d. These enhancement effects can be ascribed to the CC-PEI co-deposition on CNFs, which builds special structures and improves the interface interaction and compatibility between CPC and PUE, making the stress transfer easier. The surface of the samples has no serious deformation or damage, while the neat PUE and CNFs/PUE show obviously irreversible deformation and perforation damage. In all, the mass rate of CPC is one of the significant influence factors, which affects the dynamic impact resistance of PUE composites. Besides, compared with CNFs/PUE, the microstructures of PUE composites, which are designed as microscopic bone-like structures, have stronger impact resistance. These data indicate that CC-PEI@CNFs exhibit the significant role of preventing crack growth via bridging effect or inducing the crack deflection in the PUE matrix. These experiments confirm that the PUE composites have the ability to resist permanent damage even under high strain rate load impact, revealing their potential for robust protection engineering."

CNFs are deemed to be tiny bones, which provide strength and rigidity, and CC-PEI can be served as \u201ccollagen\u201d, providing robust adhesion and toughness, which are prepared by \u03c0-\u03c0 conjugation and hydrogen bond, etc., noncovalent bonding and robust covalent bonding, to improve the dispersity and interface interaction between CNFs and PUE. The special structures of CC-PEI@CNFs can endow PUE with comprehensive mechanical properties and marvelous impact resistance, which are beneficial for the dynamic protection field.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/nano12213830/s1, Figure S1.
