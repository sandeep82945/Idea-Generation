 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Further investigate the mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation of ATP synthase and IF1 expression in different cancer types. This could uncover new therapeutic targets and prognostic biomarkers.

2. Explore combination therapies targeting glycolysis and OXPHOS/fatty acid oxidation to prevent tumor growth and metastasis. The paper shows these pathways are promising targets.

3. Study IF1's role as a tumor suppressor or oncogene in other cancer types besides the ones discussed. This could reveal new cancer biology insights. 

4. Validate ATP synthase, IF1, and other mitochondrial proteins as prognostic biomarkers in large clinical cohorts across cancer types. This could enable better risk stratification.

5. Perform clinical trials repurposing drugs like nebivolol that target mitochondrial metabolism. The preclinical data is promising for translation to patients.
