 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Develop glycopolymers with enhanced specificity for binding to particular bacterial strains. The paper notes that many glycopolymers can bind multiple types of bacteria. Research could focus on tailoring the polymer composition, sequence, and structure to improve selectivity.

2. Design biodegradable antibacterial glycopolymers to reduce cytotoxicity and potential for resistance. The current glycopolymers are often non-degradable which could have unintended immune effects. Creating biodegradable versions could improve safety. 

3. Incorporate new antibacterial elements like selenium or molecular "needles" into glycopolymers. This could enhance antibacterial activity while maintaining specificity through the glycopolymer targeting.

4. Optimize glycopolymer structures for blocking viruses, considering parameters like sugar type/density, polymer length, and topology. Fine-tuning these properties could improve antiviral efficacy. 

5. Develop multi-functional glycopolymers that can both detect and inhibit pathogens. For example, combining fluorescent probes for detection with sugar groups for binding specificity. This could enable both diagnostics and targeted treatment.
