    "abstractText": "Background: The importance of resilience, and interest in it, has increased markedly in recent years, based on the need to understand why some children and young people have a resilience to stress that others lack. At the same time, there has been a lack of instruments to measure resilience. The aim of this study was to translate the Adolescent Resilience Questionnaire (ARQ) into Swedish and investigate the psychometrics of this Swedish version. Methods: A normative sample of 616 students aged 15\u201317 was recruited through the school system in five different communities. Students filled out a digitalised composite form consisting of ARQ and three other standardised questionnaires, the Sense of Coherence Scale-13 (Soc-13), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) and the Relationship Questionnaire (RQ). Results: The ARQ, with five domains and twelve subscales, showed good alpha coefficients \u03b1 = .95 for the total scale and subscales ranging between \u03b1 = .70 to .91, except for the subscales Emotional insight (\u03b1 = 0.69) and Empathy/Tolerance (\u03b1 = .61). The convergent validity, which was tested for the first time in this study, was good, especially with the Internal Domain for both SOC-13 and RSES. The confirmatory factor analysis showed a satisfactory construct validity. Finally, some gender differences were seen, with boys scoring higher on the total ARQ scale. Conclusion: The study shows that the Swedish translation of ARQ has satisfactory psychometric properties. The ARQ could therefore be used as a tool for adolescents when evaluating the importance of resilience.",

Students filled out a digitalised composite form consisting of ARQ and three other standardised questionnaires, the Sense of Coherence Scale-13 (Soc-13), the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) and the Relationship Questionnaire (RQ).\nResults: The ARQ, with five domains and twelve subscales, showed good alpha coefficients \u03b1 = .95 for the total scale and subscales ranging between \u03b1 = .70 to .91, except for the subscales Emotional insight (\u03b1 = 0.69) and Empathy/Tolerance (\u03b1 = .61). The convergent validity, which was tested for the first time in this study, was good, especially with the Internal Domain for both SOC-13 and RSES. The confirmatory factor analysis showed a satisfactory construct validity. Finally, some gender differences were seen, with boys scoring higher on the total ARQ scale.\nConclusion: The study shows that the Swedish translation of ARQ has satisfactory psychometric properties. The ARQ could therefore be used as a tool for adolescents when evaluating the importance of resilience.\nKeywords: Resilience, Adolescents, ARQ, Psychometric\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

            "text": "Adverse childhood experiences, ACEs, have been found to be common and have a great impact on health and psychosocial adaptation during childhood [1, 2], but also during the whole lifespan [3]. Traditionally, both in the general debate and within research, the focus has usually been on factors that contribute to why some children develop symptoms after an adverse childhood experience and much less on why some children seem to show resistance to developing symptoms and behavioural disorders.\nResilience has been defined as the ability to positively adapt or overcome adversity or stress [4, 5]. The American Psychological Association [6] defines resilience as a process whereby the individual adapts and recovers after adverse circumstances such as trauma, tragedy, threat, and/or high levels of stress. This approach gives the impression that resilience is something extraordinary, whereas it is in fact a part of the human being\u2019s inherited biological capacity to adapt and cope with difficulties [5]. The complexity of resilience consists of far more than just the child\u2019s strength to overcome life\u2019s adversities.\n*Correspondence: doris.nilsson@liu.se\n1 Department of Behavioural Sciences and Learning, Link\u00f6ping University, Link\u00f6ping, Sweden Full list of author information is available at the end of the article\nNobody has immunity against hardship, and this way of viewing resilience is to ignore the possible influence of the surrounding environment [7]. Consequently, today\u2019s research has increasingly taken into account the ecological theoretical models [8\u201310] and whether an individual\u2019s ability to adapt to adversity and be resilient is influenced by the resources this person has in his/her surrounding environment, including biological, psychological, social, and socioeconomic factors in their milieu [11\u201313]. According to this approach, resilience factors or, more aptly, lack of resilience factors can also be risk factors; for example, in the way in which living in bad surroundings can be a risk factor to resilience in the face of traumatic experiences [14, 15]. So the ability to identify resilience factors using ecological models allows for the possibility to remedy areas identified as less developed [16, 17]. For example, which areas need to be better cared for: the individual, the family, the school, the community, or the wider society. Even though some people view resilience as fundamentally permanent and unchangeable, research has found that it can be improved by training and interventions [18].\nMost of the research conducted on resilience has focused on resilience among adults. There are few studies among adolescents, and most instruments are constructed to measure resilience among adults [19]. In a review study covering the time-period 1989\u20132009 [20], 15 resilience measurement scales were studied; five of these instruments covered children and adolescents, but none of them scored high on the quality assessment. Similar results were found in a later review study of instruments measuring resilience among children and adolescents in the USA [21]. This must be seen as a shortcoming, given that adolescence can be viewed as a vulnerable stage in human development in relation to the risk of getting involved in health-risk behaviours and settings where stress is involved [22, 23]. To overcome the problems caused by the lack of knowledge concerning adolescence and the scarcity of studies taking the whole picture of resilience into account, Gartland and colleagues [24] developed a scale that included all the dimensions of the ecological model. They called the new scale The Adolescent Resilience Questionnaire (ARQ). The ARQ is a comprehensive tool and measures individual and environmental factors or resources encompassing culture, neighbourhood, school, and family, which makes it possible to favour implications in designing interventions [16, 17].\nThe ARQ comprises 88 items and 12 scales measuring resilience factors in the five domains: Self, Family, Peers, School, and Community [24]. According to Gartland et\u00a0al. [24], the ARQ was developed based on the ecological transactional model, items were developed through\nan extensive literature review and focus-group discussions and underwent multiple cycles of psychometric testing and revision. The ARQ measures personal characteristics including Confidence, Emotional Insight, Negative Cognition, Social Skills, and Empathy & Tolerance, and relevant ecological domains include family, peers, school, and community [24].\nThe psychometrics, reliability, and construct validity of the ARQ, including confirmatory factor analyses, have been investigated in three recent studies and have been found robust and good in Spain [19], Iran [25] and Nepal [26]. Having an instrument with sound and robust psychometrics and investigated in the country and culture where it is to be used is important. However, the abovementioned studies used only the ARQ in their investigations, except the study by Guliera et\u00a0al. [19], in which one other instrument, the Youth Self Report (YSR), was correlated with some domains in the ARQ. Therefore, it is important to continue an investigation of the ARQ because it is an instrument that addresses factors from the whole theoretical ecological system and has several advantages.\nConsequently, the aim of this study was to continue the investigation of Reliability and Validity of the ARQ in a sample of Swedish adolescents. To accomplish this, in addition to investigating the construct validity with confirmatory factor analysis, we developed some hypotheses, for the continuation of the establishment of validity. Based on the large body of research concerning resilience and sense of coherence [20, 27], resilience and selfesteem [28], and resilience and attachment styles [27, 29] the hypotheses were as follows:\nSelf-esteem measured by the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale (RSES) will correlate positively with the ARQ, and especially with the individual confidence domain measured by the ARQ.\n2. Sense of coherence measured with the Sense of Coherence Scale-13 (Soc-13) will correlate positively with the total ARQ and the underlying domains, such as the Individual domain and its subscales of Confidence, Emotional Insight, Negative Cognition, Social Skills, and Empathy/Tolerance on the ARQ.\n3. Secure attachment styles measured with the Relationship Questionnaire (RQ) will correlate positively with the ARQ and insecure styles will correlate negatively."

At all data collection sessions, at least one of the authors was present throughout the session (F.H. or E.K.) and was available to answer questions and respond to any reactions. Before the students\u2019 participation in the study, an oral review was held about the purpose of the study and information about the study with emphasis on voluntariness, anonymity, and instructions for implementation. After the oral review, information letters and consent forms were distributed to all students. After signing consent forms, the students were referred to the questionnaire survey via the website www. itera pi. se., which is connected to the platform at Link\u00f6ping University and is considered completely safe and secure. Since students in Sweden use laptops, both during lessons and for homework, the online solution was decided on together with the headmasters of the schools.

It covers the previous six months and the answer options lie on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (all the time) to 5 (never).

SOC is understood in terms of three components: comprehensibility, manageability, and meaningfulness [31]. In the present study, the SOC-13 was used. SOC-13 is a shorter version of SOC29 [32]. The questions relate to different areas of life and are answered on a seven-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (very seldom or never) to 7 (very often). A high overall score suggests a strong SOC.

Adjustment of the model to Swedish adolescents was made by excluding items not loading on their respective factor. Model fit was examined by Overall model fit and was tested by: Root Mean Square Error of Approximation (RMSEA), Comparative\nFit Index (CFI), Tucker-Lewis Index (TLI) and Standardised Root Mean Square Residual (SRMR). Using guiding principles set out by Brown [42] and Schreiber et\u00a0al. [43], several different fit indices were used.

The psychometrics, including reliability, construct, and convergent validity of the ARQ were found to be sound and all our hypotheses were confirmed.

This increases the usefulness of the ARQ for future studies.\nSecondly, reliability in this study must be considered excellent, with an alpha of 0.95 for the total scale and alpha above 0.80 on eight subscales, with two between 0.70 and 0.78. However, internal empathy/tolerance and emotional insight had less good alpha, with only 0.61 and 0.69 respectively. The results of this study were in line with what has been found in other studies, which have found alpha values ranging between \u03b1 = 0.64\u20130.88 [24], \u03b1 = 0.70\u20130.79 [25] and \u03b1 = 0.64\u20130.86 [26]. Guilera and colleagues [19], in their sample, found alpha values ranging between \u03b1 = 0.78\u20130.82, except for the subscales emotional insight, where they found an \u03b1 = 0.60, and empathy/tolerance, for which \u03b1 = 0.38. In summary, in three previous studies, and also in this study, for the subscale empathy/tolerance it seems to be difficult to get more than a low limit for the internal consistency.\nHowever, this was not the case in the study by Cheragi et\u00a0al. [25].\nThirdly, in order to study the construct validity, the confirmatory factor analysis showed a fairly good model fit (three out of five fit-indices indicated good model fit and the remaining two \u2013 TLI and CFI \u2013 both mainly indicating similar type of fit; 43) were close to the cutoffs specified), something which has also been found in studies from Spain [19], Iran [25], and Nepal [26]. However, item number 28 was removed because the formulation of that item did not fit, and it could be understood from the Swedish language that this item did not have the same meaning in Sweden. All items had loadings that were significant. It should be noted that item 28 belongs to the subscale empathy/tolerance where several studies, including this one, had alphas at the lower limit.\nFourthly, resilience according to the construct of the ARQ scale is based on the theories of the ecological model [8\u201310].

These five domains also have subscales intended to identify factors such as self-confidence, emotional insight, negative cognition, social skills, empathy, and tolerance (Individual domain), connectedness and availability (Family and Peers domains), a supportive environment and connectedness (School domain), and finally connectedness (Community domain). As a construct, these domains with their subscales should be interconnected to some degree, but not overlapping. The results showed significant intercorrelations between subscales, varying mostly between large to moderate, while the Community domain had some small but statistically significant intercorrelations. The largest correlations were shown among the subscales within the same domain, except for the Internal: social skills and Peers\u2019 availability, which showed a slightly higher correlation, and for the Internal: social skills and Internal empathy/tolerance, which showed a slightly smaller correlation. This result must be seen as strengthening the ecological theory behind the ARQ.\nFifthly, the convergent validity was measured by correlation of the sense of coherence, SOC-13, and Rosenberg\u2019s Self-Esteem Scale with the ARQ domains and total scale. It was found to be large with the internal domain, but also large with the total scale. High\nResilience has been found in other studies to correlate positively with Rosenberg\u2019s Self-Esteem Scale and the SOC [50]. So, it can be argued that sense of coherence and self-esteem are positively interconnected with resilience measured using the ARQ, which was hypothesised and strengthens the validity of the ARQ. Also, the hypothesis concerning the Relationship Questionnaire (RQ) was shown to be confirmed because a secure attachment style showed a significant positive correlation with the ARQ, and the more insecure attachment styles were, as expected, negatively associated with resilience. The interpretation of this suggests that attachment style is associated with resilience as measured with the ARQ. Similar findings have been found in a study by Bender and Ingram [29], who also found that secure attachment style related to resilience. However, this was true in such a way that self-efficacy and selfcare partially mediated the relationship between attachment and resilience, a pattern of relationship that was found between all the dimensions of attachment [28, 29].\nOverall, the results of this study have shown that the psychometrics of the ARQ are sound and good, although there may be room for alternative models with further improvements. The results can also be seen to strengthen the theory behind the scale, the model of the ecological theories developed by Bronfenbrenner [8, 9] and Belsky [10]. The questionnaire is rather long, but if it is to have the ability to cover all the domains involved in the ecological theory system model this is perhaps necessary since resilience is a complex concept and must be seen in the context of the whole system complex. It should be noted that, in this study, it was shown that girls scored significantly lower on the ARQ, which also has been found in a previous study in Nepal [51], but also on the SOC-13, and Rosenberg\u2019s Self-Esteem Scale, and also scored lower on the secure attachment style. Although beyond the scope of this paper, this is something that ought to be investigated in future studies, including trauma experiences, since we know from earlier studies that interpersonal traumas are more frequent among girls [1] and that there are clear associations between both psychological distress and lowered self-esteem [52] and traumatic experiences. We can see two more future areas to study scientifically. The first is whether it is possible to reduce the number of questions in the questionnaire while at the same time retaining the psychometric qualities. This research has recently begun by evaluating which items can be included in a shorter version of ARQ. The second is to use the questionnaire as a basis to evaluate whether high resilience can reduce the consequences of various traumatic events."

Even though eight out of 54 schools responded, the responding the catchment area of the responding schools is fairly representative of Sweden as a whole concerning socioeconomical data [53], indicating minimal between-class bias. According to Fincham [54], a response rate of at least 80% is required to achieve representativeness for a study population, and even though the sample did not cover 80% of all possible adolescents at all invited schools, a response rate of 94.8% among invited adolescents indicates minimal within-class bias. Therefore, even though some cautiousness should be taken, we consider the findings rather generalizable to Swedish adolescents. A limitation, or a strength, when digitalising the questionnaire package can be discussed [55]. However, it has been found to fulfil the purpose [56]. One argument for the strength is that young people in Swedish schools are using the internet very frequently, both in education and during their leisure time.\nOne limitation is that there is no test\u2013retest reliability, which could further establish the psychometrics. Another possible limitation is the use of Cronbach\u2019s alpha as measure for reliability. We did, however, calculate alternative measures [57] which, if anything, showed stronger reliability. To be coherent with other validations of ARQ [19, 24\u201326] we chose to present the more conservative (in this case) Cronbach\u2019s alpha."
