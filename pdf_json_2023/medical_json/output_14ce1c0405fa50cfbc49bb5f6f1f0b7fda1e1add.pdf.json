However, clinicians are uncomfortable discussing autopsy and may not be aware of research and organ donation opportunities. OBJECTIVE To capture the perspectives of parents who had experienced neonatal loss about autopsy, organ donation, and research donation. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This qualitative study used virtual focus groups with parents who attended a local bereavement support group in the US. Participants were recruited from Helping After Neonatal Death, a support group with a local chapter. Participants self-selected from an email request if they met the following criteria: aged 18 years or older, English speaking, at least 6 months elapsed since neonatal death, and access to a video conference device with internet. Focus groups took place between April and September 2021. The recorded sessions were analyzed using a grounded theory\u2013informed approach by the research team that included parents with experience of neonatal loss. Data were analyzed from December 2021 through December 2022. RESULTS A total of 14 mothers engaged in the focus group; 9 (75%) were aged 30 to 39 years, and 8 (66%) were White. The mothers were overall well educated. The first main theme grew from the lived experience of neonatal loss, specifically the importance of offering all parents the option to donate, rather than prejudging who would or would not be interested. Parents of neonates who die have few opportunities to parent that child and make loving decisions for them. Participants emphasized that the conversation about autopsy, organ donation, and research donation, albeit difficult, can offer a meaningful parenting experience. A second main theme that emerged related to how organ or tissue donation could provide additional meaning to a child\u2019s life. These choices contributed to building a legacy to honor their child\u2019s memory, which also helped with grief and coping with their loss. A third theme included recommendations to clinicians and health systems for improving communication, including written information for parents and communication training for health care professionals. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this qualitative study, parents who experienced neonatal loss endorsed the importance of offering parents the choice of autopsy, organ donation, or research donation with skillful and empathetic communication. They provided practical recommendations to improve communication and empower families. JAMA Network Open. 2023;6(11):e2341533. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.41533 Key Points Question Do parents who experience neonatal loss want to engage in discussions around autopsy, organ donation, and research donation? Findings In this qualitative research study, 14 bereaved parents communicated their desire to know the options for contributing to education and research after the death of their infant. Participating in these options can contribute to meaning-making, a central component of grief processing, and engaging in this decision provides an opportunity to parent their child even for families who decline. Meaning These findings suggest that although conversations about autopsy, organ donation, or research donation are challenging, parents want to be informed and make their own choices. + Supplemental content Author affiliations and article information are listed at the end of this article.

The recorded sessions were analyzed using a grounded theory\u2013informed approach by the research team that included parents with experience of neonatal loss. Data were analyzed from December 2021 through December 2022.\nRESULTS A total of 14 mothers engaged in the focus group; 9 (75%) were aged 30 to 39 years, and 8 (66%) were White. The mothers were overall well educated. The first main theme grew from the lived experience of neonatal loss, specifically the importance of offering all parents the option to donate, rather than prejudging who would or would not be interested. Parents of neonates who die have few opportunities to parent that child and make loving decisions for them. Participants emphasized that the conversation about autopsy, organ donation, and research donation, albeit difficult, can offer a meaningful parenting experience. A second main theme that emerged related to how organ or tissue donation could provide additional meaning to a child\u2019s life. These choices contributed to building a legacy to honor their child\u2019s memory, which also helped with grief and coping with their loss. A third theme included recommendations to clinicians and health systems for improving communication, including written information for parents and communication training for health care professionals.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this qualitative study, parents who experienced neonatal loss endorsed the importance of offering parents the choice of autopsy, organ donation, or research donation with skillful and empathetic communication. They provided practical recommendations to improve communication and empower families.\nJAMA Network Open. 2023;6(11):e2341533. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.41533\nKey Points Question Do parents who experience neonatal loss want to engage in discussions around autopsy, organ donation, and research donation?\nFindings In this qualitative research study, 14 bereaved parents communicated their desire to know the options for contributing to education and research after the death of their infant. Participating in these options can contribute to meaning-making, a central component of grief processing, and engaging in this decision provides an opportunity to parent their child even for families who decline.\nMeaning These findings suggest that although conversations about autopsy, organ donation, or research donation are challenging, parents want to be informed and make their own choices.\n+ Supplemental content Author affiliations and article information are listed at the end of this article.\nOpen Access.

Despite concerns about causing further distress for bereaved parents, these options can contribute to meaning-making, a central component of grief processing.2-5 Among potential benefits for families, up to 48% of neonatal autopsies show findings that were previously unknown according to clinical and radiographic tests.6 Autopsy in the context of neonatal death facilitated future family planning, addressed the family\u2019s altruistic desire to prevent future neonatal death, helped to explain their loss, and aided in the grief process by fostering a sense of emotional closure.7,8 Furthermore, autopsy can add to results from genetic testing and diagnose a hereditary condition that may impact family members.9 Due to public health campaigns, the benefits of organ donation are more readily apparent to pediatric and neonatal families.10 Although neonatal patients are rarely able to provide donated organs due to their size, engaging the family to ask their preference surrounding organ donation can be perceived as validating the child\u2019s life whether or not the organs are suitable for donation.10,11\nDespite the significant potential benefits to families of autopsy, organ donation, and research donation, clinicians rarely receive formal training to skillfully conduct these discussions.12-14 Hurried, insensitive conversations about autopsy contribute to a family\u2019s emotional distress.7 With insufficient training, clinicians are appropriately concerned about retraumatizing families and some completely avoid the topic.15-17 Although few pediatric and neonatal families are offered organ and research donation,10 a growing online presence has improved networking and support for families with children who have rare and serious conditions. This community has increased the numbers of parents interested in research donation.5,18\nGuiding families through neonatal loss should be individualized.19 Despite the high stakes of this conversation, few neonatal intensive care units (NICU) have a standard process for discussions with families about autopsy, organ donation, or research donation, leading to uneven access, racial and cultural inequities in who is approached, and potential regret.18 Critically, the voices of families who experience neonatal loss are underrepresented in the literature. The objective of our study was to engage families who experienced neonatal death and ask about their participation and interest in autopsy, organ donation, and research donation. In addition, we invited their ideas for best practices in communication about these important and sensitive topics."

Participant 1.4 also described a frustrating situation where the clinicians were not aware that autopsy was a free service: \u201cAnother person would come in later and be like, \u2018Oh, do you want to do an autopsy?\u2019 And I\u2019m like, \u2018Yes, I\u2019ve asked 2 or 3 times how much does it cost?

Parents of neonates who died have few opportunities to parent that child and make loving decisions for them. The conversation about autopsy, organ donation, and research donation can offer a meaningful parenting experience under appropriate conditions. The autopsy results can be helpful whether they identify a cause of death or not; parents reported that negative findings could offer reassurance that there was nothing else they could have done and provide closure. As Participant 2.4 said, \u201cI know it\u2019s, to each their own, but for me, the more answers the better.\u201d On the other hand, not fully discussing parental options can lead to regret when parents realize what was possible at a future date. Participant 1.2 said, \u201cBut I am an organ donor. The father is alive today because he received an organ donation. I have strong feelings about it and would have wanted to do that (organ donation), and simply wasn\u2019t asked.\u201d These experiences point to the critical importance of the clinicians\u2019 knowledge on the educational value of autopsy and whether organ and/or research donation is possible before informing the family. These pieces will allow a thoughtful discussion on the family\u2019s wishes after death.\nTable 2.

And that gave me a sense of comfort that they were invested in knowing as well.\u201d (Participant 1.4) Not being offered leaves questions \u201cNobody asked me if I wanted to donate his body through research or if I wanted to donate his organs. It was not an option that was given to me, it\u2019s an option I would have taken had it been offered to me.\u201d (Participant 1.2) Details matter: when, by whom, and which parents are involved\n\u201cBut there was also other things like the genetic testing and stuff that they never asked me about. They asked my husband, and he turned it down. I was really upset to hear about that years later; I did not know that they avoided the mother. I don\u2019t know if it was like\u2026\u2018I didn\u2019t want to emotionally upset her.\u2019 I was upset because I really still wanted to know.\u201d (Participant 3.1)\nBuilding a legacy\nMaking meaning of child\u2019s short life \u201cI strongly believe that if the circumstance permits, every single doctor should inquire whether a patient, the baby, is a candidate for organ donation with their expertise because as you know, just in and we\u2019ve all said that it just adds another level of meaning and layer to our children\u2019s lives that are cut short.\u201d (Participant 2.4) Finding answers \u201cIt was a really quick conversation, mostly because my husband and I both just had a really intuitive certain reaction of, \u2018Yes, absolutely.\u2019 I think for both of us, we at the time had an unspoken understanding, and now we have a spoken understanding of just for us, it was healing to be able to help any other parents in our situation not have to get to the point that we were at.\u201d (Participant 1.4) A positive impact for others \u201c[The physician] came back and told us\u2026that there would be 5 researchers that would be receiving her samples, that they would take 11 samples including her lungs and her heart and her brain to study autism brain development and other neurological disorders and\u2026all the stuff that her life would contribute to\u2026it put it in real terms of, okay, this is meaningful. This is what we want to do and so, we were fully on board with it.\u201d (Participant 2.4)\nParent recommendations\nPartnership and collective experience \u201cI would say something to the extent of, after you\u2019ve apologized for the loss and comforted them, say, when I do bereavement training\u2026we talk about using the collective experience: \u2018So many families have found it comforting to seek out answers for what may have caused the death.\u2019\u201d (Participant 2.4) Communications training and expertise \u201cI have really positive memories of what nurses said to me and I have really negative memories of what nurses said to me. And everything in that moment of trauma is getting deeply ingrained into your brain. Unfortunately that\u2019s just how it\u2019s working. So if everybody is trained on how to deal with it, I think like the more we can support, and the more we can ask from patients too in that space if they feel supported and safe.\u201d (Participant 3.1) Supportive environment during decision-making and with bereavement\n\u201c[Y]ou always say the baby\u2019s name. Ask, \u2018Did you get a chance to name your child? What is your child\u2019s name?\u2019 And then, from that point on, always refer to the child by their name. And then you can say, \u2018[The baby\u2019s] donations will help this research, and she will be a valuable member of the research team,\u2019 so making her be almost like a colleague, almost part of the valuable work that is being done.\u201d (Participant 2.4)\nPreparation whenever possible \u201cI like written materials, to look at and then, give me a chance to think about it before I have the conversation, talk to my husband about it, just let it sit for a little bit before we talk about it.\u201d (Participant 2.5) Consistency in personnel \u201cSo when you have multiple people, it can create the experience of it being very dehumanizing, I feel, for the parents involved. So I personally, would be an advocate for the doctor that has been the primary caregiver for that patient, being there to talk about it, in conjunction with the research coordinator, so there\u2019s a friendly face with the new face, who has the standardized, appropriate, emotional language to discuss. That would be the ideal situation.\u201d (Participant 2.4)\nJAMA Network Open. 2023;6(11):e2341533. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.41533 (Reprinted) November 6, 2023 5/10\nDownloaded from jamanetwork.com by guest on 01/14/2024"

Another parent reported that it was difficult to speak about her baby in the presence of other families. They often did not know how to respond to her, and this isolation brought additional sadness.

            "text": "Parents who experienced neonatal loss had many recommendations for a standardized approach in these challenging situations. One key idea centered around relationships that support parents at this time and lessen isolation. Because of the high-risk NICU population, these conversations often take place in the middle of the night or on weekends. Therefore, all personnel who work in neonatal/ perinatal care should receive bereavement and communications training to be able to skillfully assist a parent to make these decisions. This training needs to empower health care workers to respond individually to a range of family needs, ask for feedback in real time, and adjust their communication according to the family\u2019s preferences. Parents recommended drawing on the collective experience, using language such as, \u201cSome families have made this decision for this reason; for other families, they chose a different course because of these important factors.\u201d Timing is challenging. Most participants recommended discussing autopsy, organ donation, and research donation in the context of other decisions about end-of-life care, such as baptism or whether to have family visit. This approach lessens decision fatigue and allows families to think holistically about their parenting choices. In addition, they recommended written materials describing autopsy, organ donation, and research donation. During times of acute stress, it can be difficult to remember details about these procedures. Written materials can also be left with the families to make the decision at their own pace. A word cloud constructed from the coded data of the focus groups highlights the centrality of communication in both the families\u2019 experiences and their recommendations (eFigure in Supplement 1).\nOur findings led to a proposed framework for working with families who experience neonatal loss (Figure 2), encompassing equitable empathy and respect. Focus group participants suggested that clinicians needed to help them become aware earlier that death was possible. One participant felt strongly that this conversation should take place in prenatal appointments, in cases where there is a high likelihood of neonatal death. After a sensitive and thoughtful discussion about their baby\u2019s impending death, clinicians should then help families consider all of their secondary hopes.24 In the\nFigure 2.

With this framing, offering options for autopsy, organ donation, or research donation becomes a natural part of holistic and compassionate end-of-life care. This approach can then facilitate a better adjustment to the baby\u2019s death by the family. One critical aspect to this discussion is that clinicians have local and institutional knowledge about organ and research donation. Clinicians should make every effort to contact the donor network before speaking with families to determine a baby\u2019s eligibility for donation. In some cases, the donor network can also facilitate research.25 Finally, engagement with families about autopsy, organ donation, and/or research donation naturally promotes follow-up for families to ensure adequate bereavement care."

            "text": "In this study, we sought to understand the perspectives of parents who experience neonatal loss on autopsy, organ donation, and research donation. A primary finding in our research is the importance of offering parents the choice of autopsy, organ donation, or research donation with skillful and empathetic communication. Parents in our study endorsed the ability of these options in the setting of neonatal loss to establish a legacy for their deceased child. Furthermore, they offered suggestions to frame autopsy, organ donation, and research donations in ways that support and empower parents rather than further burden or traumatize them. These include providing written materials, emphasizing the collective experience, integrating discussions about the end of life, and having trained and compassionate clinicians who know the family participate in these discussions. A framework for our themes shows how parents\u2019 lived experience can lead to building a legacy, which includes recommendations to integrate posthumous decision-making as a pivotal piece of the medical care for families with neonatal loss (Figures 1 and 2).\nOur findings are consistent with prior research4,26 that families want to be directed and informed in the processes of neonatal loss. This practice, guided participation, is a cornerstone of individualized, supportive, relationship-based perinatal bereavement care.27 Even though these discussions are challenging, they can help promote healing.10,14,28 Although not directly investigated in our research, our findings may also help clinicians integrate genetic testing, an increasingly available resource, in the context of neonatal loss.29,30\nWe speculate that discussions about autopsy, organ donation, and research donation help facilitate meaning-making and provide a sense of control, at least over some elements, when a life is lost. Emerging evidence suggests that NICU families and health care workers use different words when describing death.31 Future studies should investigate how different phrasing can modify the impact of these discussions on family comprehension and grief processing. Common reasons for avoidance of discussions with parents about autopsy, organ donation, and research donation include lack of training and fear of taking away a family\u2019s hope.15,16,32 Our findings add to prior research in perinatal loss, demonstrating that offering autopsy can help provide meaning to the current experience and enable families to feel more informed as they plan for the future.8,17 Our study further adds that emphasizing the educational aspects of autopsy is important for some families. It is comforting for them to know that the clinicians will use the autopsy to carefully review the case and potentially change practices in the future. Common reasons cited for parents to decline autopsy include concerns about bodily integrity and dignity, stress of giving permission, objections from other family members, misunderstanding about why autopsy is being requested, religious and cultural objections, and concerns about interference with funeral arrangements.33,34 In addition, parents in our study who declined autopsy described a sense that their child\u2019s life was complete without needing the information gained from the autopsy. These factors emphasize the individual nature of appropriate counseling on this topic. Participating in autopsy, organ donation, and research donation is not the right choice for every family. However, informing every family of these possibilities, tailored to the specific options available at each institution, should be a standard part of equitable care for neonatal death.\nJAMA Network Open. 2023;6(11):e2341533. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.41533 (Reprinted) November 6, 2023 7/10\nDownloaded from jamanetwork.com by guest on 01/14/2024"
