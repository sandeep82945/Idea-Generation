            "text": "This paper proposes a novel method for constructing an asymmetric spatial weight6 matrix and applies it to improve spatial econometric modeling. As opposed to7 traditional spatial weight matrices that simply consider geographic or economic8 proximity, the spatial weight matrix proposed in this study is based on large-volume9\ndaily population flow data. It can more accurately reflect the socio-economic10 interactions between cities over any given period. To empirically test the validity and11 accuracy of this proposed spatial weight matrix, we apply it to a spatial econometric12 model that analyzes COVID-19 transmission in Mainland China. Specifically, this13 matrix is used to address spatial dependence in outcome and explanatory variables, and14 to calculate the direct and indirect effects of all predictors. We also propose a practical15 framework that combines Instrumental Variable regressions and a Hausman test to16 validate the exogeneity of this matrix. The test result confirms its exogeneity, hence it17 can produce consistent estimates in our spatial econometric models. Moreover, we18 find that spatial econometric models using our proposed population-flow-based spatial19 weight matrix significantly outperform those using the traditional inverse distance20 weight matrix in terms of goodness-of-fit and model interpretation, thus providing21 more reliable results. Our methodology not only has implications for national epidemic22 control and prevention policies but can also be applied to a wide range of research to23 better address spatial autocorrelation issues.24\nKeywords: Population flow, spatial weight matrix, endogeneity, spatial dependence1 (autocorrelation), COVID-19 transmission2\n1. Introduction1\nMany phenomena in the real-world are spatially dependent. For example, economic2 development, meteorological conditions, air pollution and the spread of diseases between3 neighboring regions may correlate or interact with each other to a greater or lesser extent.4 Traditional econometric models assume the spatial dependence or spatial spillovers between5 research units to be zero, which may generate biased estimates of regression coefficients6 (Vega and Elhorst 2013). To empirically assess the magnitude and significance of the spatial7 dependence or spatial spillover effects, spatial econometric models have been widely used8 (LeSage 2008; ; Vega and Elhorst 2013). The interactions between spatial units in spatial9 econometric models are reflected through a spatial weight matrix (SWM), a square matrix of10 size N*N, with N being the number of research units being modeled. SWMs have played a11 vital role in deriving accurate models and estimates (Chen 2021). However, it is often12 challenging to select and construct an appropriate SWM that accurately reflects the spatial13 correlation and interactions between research units (Seya, Yamagata, and Tsutsumi 2013;14 Lam, and Souza 2020).15 Traditional forms of spatial weight matrices include contiguity-based SWM (Cliff and16 Ord 1975), inverse-distance-based SWM (Anselin 2001), economically-based SWM (Conley17 and Ligon 2002) and nested SWM that combined both geographic and economic distances18 (Fingleton and Le Gallo 2008). The contiguity-based SWM remains one of the most popular19 spatial weight matrices (Getis 2009). Although the contiguity-based SWM is relatively easy20 to build, it ignores the varying degrees of interactions among neighboring units. The21\ninverse-distance-based SWM assumes that the intensity of interactions depends on1 geographic distance (Getis 2009). However, in many contexts, geographic proximity may not2 fully reflect the relevant connections between spatial units. For instance, after Wuhan\u2019s3 COVID-19 lockdown in January 2020, a SWM based on geographic proximity is4 inappropriate to capture the city\u2019s actual connections with other cities. Furthermore, new5 transportation technologies such as high-speed rail have changed the effective distance and6 the frequency and intensity of interactions between two places in real space, altering the7 strength and scope of spillover effects (Yu, Chen and Zhu,. 2012; Zhu et al. 2015; Cao and8 Zhu, 2017; Ahlfeldt and Feddersen, 2018; Zhu, 2021). Another major limitation of these9 traditional SWMs is the symmetric assumption of spatial spillover effects, which may deviate10 from the actual spatial interaction processes. Therefore, more appropriate spatial weight11 matrices that account for the real socio-economic interactions induced and amplified by12 modern technological innovations (e.g., transportation, communication) are needed to better13 reflect the spillovers between research units.14 While most previous empirical studies focus on the application of spatial econometric15 models, only a few studies have introduced new ways to construct spatial weight matrices to16 better capture the underlying interaction process. For example, Case and Hines (1993) used17 income and racial composition to describe the associations between states. Zhang et al. (2009)18 proposed a co-movement SWM by accounting for the similarity of economic factors between19 regions. Getis and Aldstadt (2004) constructed a SWM based on the \ufffd\ufffd\u2217 local statistic. Emch20 et al. (2012) applied spatial proximity and social relationships separately to construct a SWM21\nand compare the spatial clustering pattern of disease transmission based on the two types of1 matrices. Taking into consideration the actual connections between spatial units, some studies2 have introduced actual population flow (e.g., Kordi and Fotheringham 2016) or flow intensity3 calculated based on GDP per capita and the number of people employed in different4 industries in connected cities (Li 2017) into the SWM. However, the above studies have5 mainly focused on the spatial interaction process itself. They do not apply their updated6 SWMs to improve spatial econometric models and illustrate the spillover effects generated by7 the spatial interaction processes.8 The major contributions of this research, therefore, lie not only in constructing an9\nasymmetric SWM based on large-volume daily population flows between geographic units,10 but more importantly, in applying the new SWM to improve spatial econometric modeling11 and to provide more reliable estimates of the (direct and spillover) effects of key variables. In12 the modeling of various social, economic, and health outcomes, a population-flow-based13 SWM may better approximate the actual process of spatial interactions than traditional spatial14 weight matrices using inverse distance or contiguity. This improved SWM also accounts for15 potential asymmetric spatial spillover effects (i.e., spillover from A to B not equal to spillover16 from B to A). This is consistent with the fact that the flows of people, goods, and information17 between spatial units are likely to be asymmetrical due to geographical constraints (e.g., Xu18 et al. 2016) or the uneven level of development between spatial units (e.g., Parent and LeSage19 2006). In the empirical analysis of this paper, we construct the proposed SWM using20 real-time population flow data and apply it in spatial econometric models to analyze the21\ntransmission of COVID-19 in Mainland China between January 11 and February 25, 20201 (excluding the two special administrative regions of Hong Kong and Macau and Taiwan2 region). By comparing the results of our model with an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model3 and spatial econometric model using inverse distance SWM, we find that the proposed model4 provides more reliable results that may better inform policy for epidemic control and5 prevention. In addition to application in infectious disease control, this methodology may also6 be applicable in investigating a variety of spatial outcomes that depend on human contact7 (e.g., economic, social, transportation, or public health studies).8 The remainder of this article is structured as follows. Section 2 provides a brief9\nreview of the literature on spatial econometrics as well as the specification of the SWM.10 Section 3 introduces the construction process of the population-flow-based SWM. An11 example of the application of the proposed SWM in spatial regression is presented in12 Section 4 and conclusions are presented in the final section.13\n14\n2. Literature review15\nSpatial econometrics was first proposed by Paelinck and Klaassen (1979) to improve16 traditional econometric approaches by capturing the spatial dependence between observations17 (Elhorst 2014). It has been widely used in fields such as transportation (e.g., Szab\u00f3, and18 T\u00f6r\u00f6k 2020), environmental studies (e.g., Lv, Chen, and Cheng 2019), economics (e.g., J. Li,19 and S. Li 2020), and public health (e.g., Ispriyanti, Prahutama, and Taryono 2018).20\nThe construction of spatial weight matrices is the key to spatial econometric models.1 SWMs are designed to reflect the interactions between spatial units (Kostov 2010) and may2 take different forms depending on the rationales behind the scenes. The earliest form of the3 SWM was the contiguity-based SWM (Getis 2009). This category of SWMs can be further4 divided into first-order contiguity matrices and high-order contiguity matrices. First-order5 contiguity matrices assume that spatial interactions only occur between spatial units sharing a6 common border (first-order neighbors) and the strength of the interactions between all pairs7 of first-order neighbors is the same (Getis 2009). High-order contiguity matrices are8 constructed in a similar way. For example, if one unit is given, its second-order neighbors are9\ndefined as the neighbors of its first-order neighbors, and so on. Although easy to implement,10 the basic assumption of the contiguity-based approach that no variations exist in the degree of11 interactions among neighbors of the same order is only a simplified measure of spatial12 interactions in the real world. Another type of SWM is the inverse distance matrix, which13 constructs spatial weights using the distance between pairs of observations (Perret 2011).14 Following Tobler\u2019s first law of geography (Tobler 1970), the underlying assumption of this15 approach is that the intensity of spatial relations among observations decreases as the distance16 between them increases. Most studies use the Euclidean distance between two spatial units to17 calculate spatial weights (e.g., Lu and Zhang 2011; Lv, Chen, and Cheng 2019), while other18 studies use alternative measures such as travel time (e.g., Conley and Topa 2002) or railway19 network distance (e.g., Lv, Chen, and Cheng 2019) to capture the physical proximity or travel20 costs between two units in the real world.21\nWith high residential mobility and the development of advanced communication1 technologies in the modern world, geographic constraints have become weaker (Webber 1964;2 Wellman and Leighton 1979; Snyder 1995), and the influence of physical distance on the3 interactions among nodes in networks has declined (Conley and Topa 2002). To better4 capture the diverse spatial interaction processes that are not constrained by physical distance,5 some studies have used non-physical distance measures such as economic distance (Case et al.6 1994; Pietrzak 2010), trade volumes (Aten 1997; Cohen and Paul 2004),7 industrial structure proximity (Zhang, Chen and Wang 2009), social contacts (Conley and8 Topa 2002) and social network/relationships (Emch et al. 2012; Leenders 2002) to substitute9\nfor physical distance. The nested weights matrix that combines the inverse geographic10 distance and non-physical distance matrices is another way to account for various spatial,11 economic, technological and transportation proximity factors influencing the spatial12 interaction processes (Parent and LeSage, 2008). However, one significant limitation of all13 the aforementioned SWM is the assumption of symmetric spatial spillover effects (i.e., the14 impact from observation i to observation j is equal to the impact from j to i), which does not15 accurately describe the spatial and socio-economic interaction processes in the real world. To16 deal with this limitation, a number of studies have constructed asymmetrical nested weights17 matrices (Li et al. 2010; Zheng et al. 2019). This type of matrix considers both geographic18 and economic proximity, but the indicator selection and matrix definition are relatively19 subjective and cannot incorporate population flow into measures of spatial associations.20 Focusing on infectious disease transmission, neighborhood relationships, hydrologic21\nconnectivity of villages (Gu and Spear 2006), and kinship relationships (Emch et al. 2012)1 have also been used to construct asymmetric SWMs.2 In the network analysis literature, network autocorrelations have been noticed and3 investigated by a growing body of studies. Black (1992) proposed a new method based on4 Moran\u2019s I statistics to measure network autocorrelations and argued that weight matrices are5 essential to reflect network structures. Leenders (2002) used social distance to construct6 spatial weights and applied the SWM in spatial modeling of the dependence embedded in7 electoral behavior. Chun (2008) applied eigenvector spatial filtering to build a network link8 matrix that combines the influences of competing destinations and intervening opportunities9\non travel behavior and used the matrix in a spatial filtering interaction model to analyze10 interstate migration behavior in the U.S. Ermagun and Levinson (2018) used the properties11 of networks to construct a SWM for examining spatial dependence in traffic network analysis.12 These studies recognize the mechanism and sources of network autocorrelations and13 emphasize the importance of incorporating network autocorrelations in understanding these14 networks. But none of them apply their updated SWMs in spatial econometric models to15 explicitly examine the direct and spillover effects induced by these network autocorrelations.16 Other recent studies have incorporated actual population flows into the construction17 of spatial weight matrices. The flow of population is not only an important spatial interaction18 process but also facilitates other spatial spillover effects such as the transmission of ideas and19 beliefs (Leenders 2002; Homans 2013) as well as infectious diseases (Anderson 2013; Jia et20 al. 2020; Wei and Wang 2020;). Kordi and Fotheringham (2016) proposed a family of21\nlocalized spatially weighted interaction models (SWIM) including origin/destination-focused1 SWIM and flow-focused SWIM to address the spatial heterogeneity in spatial interactions2 using a geographical weighting approach; they proved that this method performed better in3 spatially nonstationary processes analysis. Moreover, the population flows between spatial4 units are usually asymmetric in nature and those areas with large net inflows or outflows may5 exert stronger spillover effects. For example, cities with more move-out population flow are6 more influential (Wei et al. 2018), serving as the critical nodes in the population flow7 network and influencing key properties of the network like clustering and transitivity (Xu et8 al. 2010; Alstott et al. 2014). These cities are highly associated with upsurges in epidemic9\ntransmission (Zhong and Bian 2016). Thus, a population-flow-based matrix not only better10 models the spatial interaction processes, but also better reflects the asymmetric nature of the11 interactions between spatial units. However, previous studies have mainly applied12 population-flow-based matrices to examine the spatial interaction process itself but have not13 incorporated these matrices into spatial regressions to model the actual channels of spatial14 spillover (i.e., human interactions) and further examine how the incorporation of15 population-flow-based matrices will improve spatial model specifications. The population16 flow data used in previous studies are usually yearly or monthly averages, while real-time17 data on daily population movement are seldom applied in spatial modeling.18\n19\n3. Conceptual framework for constructing the SWM using population flow1\nTo fill in the research gaps, this paper proposes a method of constructing a SWM based on2 the volume of population flow between two cities and applies the matrix in spatial regressions3 to better capture the actual spatial interaction processes. Using the COVID-19 outbreak in4 Mainland China as an example, we construct a population-flow-based SWM based on Baidu5 population flow data obtained from Baidu Huiyan platform (https://qianxi.baidu.com/2020/)6 and apply it in spatial regressions to explore the influencing factors and the real transmission7 mechanisms in the spread of COVID-19.8\n9\n3.1 Theoretical framework10\nSpatial weight matrices represent the interaction processes between geographic units such as11 cities, regions, and provinces. The definition of spatial weights is the key element of matrix12 construction (Leenders 2002). In this study, spatial weights based on population movement13 are defined as follows:14\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd = 1 \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd (1)15 where the \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd is the spatial weight of unit i towards unit j, \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd reflects the volume of16 population movement from city i to city j, k is the number of days in the period. Note that this17 is an asymmetrical weight matrix as \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd is not equal to \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd. This overcomes a major18 shortcoming of traditional symmetrical spatial weight matrices that ignores the direction of19 population flow between city pairs.20\n1\n3.2 The construction of the SWM2\nBased on the findings of existing studies, human mobility significantly contributes to the3 transmission of COVID-19 (Fang, Wang, and Yang 2020; Qiu, Chen, and Shi 2020; Wei et al.4 2021; Zhao et al. 2020). Hence, we use Baidu population flow data to construct the SWM in5 our spatial econometric model.6 The daily inter-city population flow indices were collected from the Baidu Migration7 Platform developed by Baidu, Inc. This database applies a location-based service (LBS)8 technology to record and visualize the population movement trajectories of all mobile internet9\nusers throughout Mainland China. The database encompasses around 80 percent of the total10 number of mobile phone users in Mainland China, thus providing a strong approximation of11 the actual population flow between and within cities (Wei et al. 2018). This dataset has been12 used in several geospatial analyses of COVID-19 transmission (e.g., Fang, Wang, and Yang13 2020; Qiu, Chen, and Shi 2020; Liu et al. 2020; Zhu and Guo 2021; Zhu and Tan 2021). For14 each pair of cities, the Baidu Migration Platform provides the daily population flow indices15 between them (including both the moving-out indices and moving-in indices1). For each city,16 the precise shares of outflows to the top 100 destinations are available, which on average17 cover over 97 percent outflows (Fang, Wang, and Yang 2020). This suggests that the data18\n1 The moving-out indices and moving-in indices are based on the travel intensity between specific city-pairs. For example, the moving-out index of Beijing to Tianjin is referred to the volume of population flow traveling from Beijing to Tianjin. According to Baidu\u2019s meta-data, population flow from city i to city j is considered as the move-out index for city i and the move-in index for city j.\nshould be able to accurately capture the real volume of population flows among cities during1 the research periods. For the remaining 3 percent of outflows to other destinations where2 precise values are not given, we follow the first law of geography (Tobler 1970) and adopt3 inverse distance weighted interpolation2 to estimate the outflow values for each remaining4 city. The specific process of population-flow weight matrix construction in this study is5 shown in Figure 1. Note that we also test the robustness of our results by alternatively using a6 gravity model to impute these missing values for the population-flow-based SWM, as shown7 in section 4.6.8 9\n2 The inverse distance weighted interpolation follows the equation:\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd =\n1 \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd2 \u2217 (100 \u2212 1 \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd)\n1 \ufffd 1 \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd2\nwhere Distance ij is the Euclidean distance between city i and city j; A is the number of destination cities with accurate move-out indices for origin city i; V is the number of destination cities without accurate move-out indices for origin city i.\nWe take the averages of each element in the daily matrix of city pairs\u2019 moving-out1\nindices by periods as \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd = 1 \ufffd\ufffd \ufffd=1 \ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd , in which \ufffd\ufffd denotes the number of the2 days in period A. After min-max normalization, the matrix of city pairs\u2019 moving-out indices3 was used as the SWM in the spatial models.4\n5\n4. Application of the SWM to COVID-19 transmission analysis6\nCOVID-19 was first identified in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province. It rapidly spread7 outward across China and to other countries, posing a severe threat to human health.8 COVID-19 is transmitted through human-to-human contacts, including airborne and fomite9\ntransmissions (World Health Organization 2020). Therefore, human interactions are critical10 to the transmission of COVID-19.11 In this section, we use city pairs\u2019 moving-out indices as the spatial weights in the12 construction of SWM and estimate the direct, indirect, and total impacts of different13 independent variables on the number of cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19 in each14 city through spatial econometric models. Baidu started to publicly report daily population15 flow data on January 11, 2020; hence the period of our analyses can only start on this date.16 The first imported case in Mainland China was confirmed on February 26, 2020, when a17 traveler from Iran was reported positive in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region. From then18 on, more imported cases were confirmed among travelers from foreign countries,19 contributing to a new wave of outbreaks in Mainland China. Since the impacts of the20\nimported cases on pandemic transmission cannot be distinguished from those of other1 independent variables in this study, we only look at the period before February 26, 2020 to2 avoid interference from these imported cases. In addition, population (out) flows from Wuhan,3 the epicenter of the COVID-19 outbreak, slumped after the city\u2019s lockdown at 10 am on4 January 23 and the implementation of strict nationwide prevention and control measures.5 Therefore, we divide the sample into two subperiods: 1) the period before the Wuhan6 lockdown (January 11\u201323, 2020), during which inter-city travel in Mainland China was7 normal; and 2) the post-lockdown period (January 24 \u2013 February 25, 2020). We implement8 spatial econometric analysis for these two periods separately to examine the different impacts9\nof explanatory variables during the two periods.10\n11\n4.1 Spatial econometric models12\nThe transmission of COVID-19 is influenced by a wide variety of factors. Some studies have13 argued that coronavirus transmission is affected by geographical proximity, socioeconomic14 interactions, and the similarity of meteorological conditions across neighboring spatial units15 (Andersen et al. 2021; Sannigrahi et al. 2020). Therefore, spatial autocorrelation of virus16 transmission as well as of the independent variables need to be incorporated in spatial17 econometric models (e.g., spatial lag model [SLM], spatial error model [SEM] and spatial18 Durbin model [SDM]). This allows for more accurate estimation compared to an ordinary19\nleast square (OLS) model. To correctly specify the model, the existence of spatial1 autocorrelation in the COVID-19 data must first be tested.2 The global Moran\u2019s I index is widely used to detect spatial dependence (Moran 1950):3\n\ufffd = \ufffd \ufffd \u2219 \ufffd=1\n\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\u2219(\ufffd\ufffd\u2212\ufffd )(\ufffd\ufffd\u2212\ufffd )\n\ufffd=1 \ufffd (\ufffd\ufffd\u2212\ufffd )2\n(2)4\nwhere N is the number of cities; \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd represents an element of the SWM, which defines the5 spatial relationships between cities; W is the sum of all \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd; \ufffd\ufffd(\ufffd\ufffd) and \ufffd is the specific6 variable in city i (j), and the \ufffd denotes the mean of \ufffd. The value of Moran\u2019s I does not range7 exactly from -1 to 1 but depends on the spatial weight matrix of the study area (De Jong,8 Sprenger and van Veen 1984). In general, a negative Moran\u2019s I value indicates spatial9\ndispersion, while a positive value indicates spatial clustering.10 Commonly used spatial econometric models include SLM, SEM, SDM, and the11 spatial Durbin error model (SDEM)3. Among these models, SLM accounts for spatial12 dependence in the dependent variable, while SEM accounts for spatial dependence in the13 error term (Gujarati 2021). The SDM is specifically designed to capture the spatial spillover14 effects of both the explanatory variables and the explained variable. It can also be treated as15 an unrestricted model that can be simplified into SLM and SEM by coefficient setting16 (LeSage 2008). The SDM can be denoted as:17 \ufffd = \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd + \ufffd\ufffd + \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd + \ufffd + \ufffd (3)18\n3 According to Vega and Elhorst (2013), there are three other types of spatial econometric models: 1) the SLX (spatial lag of X) model that includes spatial interactions of explanatory variables; 2) the SAC model that includes a spatially lagged dependent and a spatially correlated error term; 3) the general nesting spatial (GNS) model that includes all three types of spatial interaction effects.\nwhere Y is the total number of confirmed cases during each period (Period I or II, as1 previously defined) and X is a series of explanatory variables that may affect virus2 transmission. \ufffd\ufffd and \ufffd\ufffd are two spatial matrices constructed based on the population3 flow volume4 and the inverse of geographical distance between city pairs, respectively.4 Because COVID-19 has clear evidence and characteristics of human-to-human transmission,5 it is more appropriate to use the population-flow-based matrix \ufffd\ufffd to capture the spatial6 interactions of this (outcome) variable. For spatially lagged explanatory variables, we use7 geographical distance \ufffd\ufffd as the weighting matrix because geographical proximity can8 better capture the spatial spillovers of our explanatory variables, e.g., socioeconomic factors9\nand meteorological factors. \ufffd denotes the constant and \ufffd is the error term. When \ufffd = 0, no10 spatial lagged explanatory variables are embedded and the SDM is transformed into the SLM.11\nTo examine the potential endogeneity of the spatial weight matrix \ufffd\ufffd, we follow the12 method in Cheng and Lee (2017) and propose a linear regression model with an endogenous13 variable WY:14 \ufffd = \ufffd + \ufffd(\ufffd\ufffd) + \ufffd\ufffd + \ufffd (4)15 where W is a N*N spatial weight matrix,WY is a N*1 column vector, and X is a N*k16 matrix. The spatial autoregressive term WY is an endogenous variable as it is affected by Y,17 regardless of whether W is endogenous or exogenous. Potentially we can adopt an18\n4 During Period I, population flow between cities in China was not disrupted because it was only announced on January 20 that COVID-19 can be transmitted human-to-human and no further warnings on travel risks were announced until January 23. Moreover, Baidu did not publicly release daily population flow data until January 11. Therefore, in the models for Period I, the spatial weight matrix is built based on the population flow volume during Period I. In the models for Period II, we still use the population flow volume during Period I to account for the 14-day incubation period of the virus.\nInstrumental Variable (IV) model and useWX as a series of instrumental variables to address1 the endogenous WY, because WX is clearly correlated withWY. The key point affecting their2 validity as instruments lies in whether WX is also correlated with \ufffd (Greene 2012; Zhu 2011).3 If W is exogenous, then WX is uncorrelated with \ufffd; hence WX is a valid instrument. If W is4 endogenous, then WX is correlated with \ufffd; hence WX is no longer a valid instrument.5 Arguably, the inverse distance-based W is an exogenous SWM, which will lead to consistent6 2SLS estimates if used in the above model setting. This lays the foundation for a Hausman7 test which can help us determine whether there are systematic differences between the model8 using population-flow-based \ufffd\ufffd (potentially endogenous) and the model using inverse9\ndistance-based \ufffd\ufffd (known exogenous); that is, whether the population-flow-based \ufffd\ufffd is10 also exogenous. We follow a classic Hausman test specification where the null hypothesis is11 that \ufffd\ufffd is exogenous (i.e., no systematic differences between the two models), and the12 alternative hypothesis is that \ufffd\ufffd is endogenous. We first run the IV model using \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd as13 instrumental variables and store the estimation results, which should give us a consistent14 estimator because \ufffd\ufffd is known exogenous. We then rerun the model using \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd as15 instrumental variables and compare the estimation results to the previous model via the16 Hausman test. The statistic of our Hausman test is found to be negative (-15.69), which17 suggests that we cannot reject the null hypothesis (Baltagi 2008; Hsiao 2014; StataCorp18 2017). In other words, no systematic differences are found in the estimated coefficients19\nbetween the two models. Therefore, our population-flow-based \ufffd\ufffd proves to also be1 exogenous and hence should produce consistent estimates in our spatial econometric models.52 In addition to the Hausman test above serving as technical evidence for the3 exogeneity of our population-flow-based SWM, we also believe it is conceptually convincing4 based on our research design. During Period I, inter-city travel in Mainland China was not5 disrupted at all, because no warnings about travel risks were announced until January 23,6 2020 when the lockdown of Wuhan happened. Although virus transmission occurred during7 this period, population flow between cities was arguably exogeneous to the number of8 COVID-19 confirmed cases as life was normal at the time. In our Period II model, to account9\nfor the incubation period of the virus, we construct the SWM still based on population flow10 volume during Period I and use it for the spatial lagged dependent variable (i.e., total11 confirmed cases during Period II). This design further eliminates potential endogeneity of the12 weight matrix.13\n14\n5 Note that the exogeneity of our population-flow-based W depends on what outcome variable is used in the model. In our models, daily COVID-19 case number is the outcome variable. In other models using socioeconomic variables as outcome variables, the exogeneity of our population-flow-based W may be affected.\n4.2 Data source and variable selection1\n4.2.1 City-level COVID-19 epidemiological data2\nDaily COVID-19 infection data for the period from January 11 to February 25, 2020 in3 Mainland China was retrieved from the China Data Lab of Harvard Dataverse6. This data was4 scraped from the daily COVID-19 infection data on DXY.cn, one of the earliest open datasets5 developed to track the COVID-19 outbreak7. Some cities such as the Special Administrative6 Regions of Hong Kong and Macao are excluded from our analysis due to the lack of7 socio-economic data, Baidu population flow indices or meteorological variables. Note that8 Wuhan is also excluded because it is regarded as an outlier for the purposes of this study and9\nmay lead to biased results. The final number of cities contained in this study is 272. The10 number of cumulative confirmed cases is separately calculated for each of the two study11 periods (i.e., the pre-lockdown and post-lockdown periods) for each city and used as the12 dependent variable. For the Period II model, the cumulative confirmed cases of each city at13 the end of period I were included as an explanatory variable to represent their initial infection14 levels at the time of the Wuhan lockdown.15\n16\n6 https://doi.org/10.7910/DVN/MR5IJN\n7 According to DXY.cn, the COVID-19 infection data they published was reported by 32 provincial-level Health Commissions in China\n4.2.2 Baidu population flow Data1\nAs mentioned in Section 3.2, the population flow indices obtained from the Baidu population2 flow dataset reflect the daily population movements between cities in Mainland China.3 Meanwhile, the dataset also provides a daily within-city population flow index for each city.4 These two indices were used in this study as proxies for the intensity of inter-city and5 within-city population flow. Specifically, considering the significant level of infection risks6 due to population outflow from Wuhan (Qiu, Chen, and Shi 2020), the average population7 outflow originating from Wuhan towards each destination city8 was incorporated into the8 model as an important explanatory variable. Moreover, transportation research often relates9\nresidents\u2019 travel demand to social and economic interactions (Zhou, Zhang and Zhu 2019;10 Zhu et. al 2020), hence within-city population flow should also be included as an explanatory11 variable.12\n13\n4.2.3 Socio-economic data14\nPrevious research on the development of epidemics has suggested that it is necessary to take15 socio-economic factors such as population, economic development, and medical resources16\n8 To convert the two indices into the actual volume of person-movements in and out of each city, we use the daily number of people traveling into and out of Hong Kong provided by the Hong Kong Immigration Department to calibrate and calculate the number of people that each moving-in index and moving-out index unit corresponds to. Using this data, we estimate that one index unit in the move-in index and move-out index corresponds to 71,121 person-movements. This estimated converting factor is constant across all cities and is used to calculate the actual daily volume of population inflow and outflow of each city.\ninto consideration since they can greatly affect social interactions, residents\u2019 behavior, and1 pandemic diagnosis effectiveness, thereby influencing the transmission of COVID-192 (Oyedotun and Moonsammy 2021; Qiu et al. 2020; Zhai et al. 2021). The socio-economic3 variables selected include the total population of urban areas, GDP per capita and licensed4 doctors per capita for each city collected from the latest version of the China City Statistic5 Yearbook (2018).6\n7\n4.2.4 Natural meteorological data8\nAs meteorological conditions potentially play a role in the transmission of contagious9\ndiseases (Li et al. 2019; Shi et al. 2020), this study also considers natural meteorological10 factors including average daily temperature, average daily wind speed, and average daily air11 quality index (AQI). Meteorological data were acquired from the China Meteorological Data12 Service Centre9, which includes hourly records of meteorological elements of each13 meteorology observation. We first calculated the daily data by averaging the hourly data of14 each day for each variable. For each city where meteorological data were not available, the15 value of each meteorological variable was imputed using the Empirical Bayesian Kriging16 inverse distance weighted interpolation in ArcGIS (Krivoruchko and Gribov 2019)10. We17\n9 http://data.cma.cn/ 10 Kriging is a type of statistical technique for optimal spatial prediction, which has been used widely in meteorological applications, agriculture, geosciences and many other disciplines due to its minimized prediction error. Compared with classical Kriging methods, the Empirical Bayesian Kriging is more robust by accounting for the errors introduced by the estimation of the Semivariogram model (Krivoruchko and Gribov 2019).\nthen further aggregate the daily meteorological data into the two defined periods for each city1 using the average values of each meteorological element.2 AQI is based on the level of six atmospheric pollutants (SO2, NO2, PM2.5, PM10, CO,3 O3) measured at all monitoring stations throughout every city. Each record includes4 information on the daily average, maximum, minimum, and standard deviation values of AQI.5 In this study, we will use the daily average AQI to represent the air quality conditions of each6 research unit.7 The descriptive statistics of all the variables are given in Table 1. Because of their8 skewed distributions, the dependent variables and some of the explanatory variables are9\ntransformed into logarithms in the models (e.g., total population, GDP per capita, doctors per10 capita, total number of confirmed cases in Period \u2160).11\n[Table 1 Descriptive Statistics of the Dependent and Independent Variables]12\n4.3 Spatial autocorrelation tests and model selection13\nThe spatial autocorrelation test results are illustrated in Table 2. The significantly positive14 values of Moran\u2019s I indices suggest the existence of strong spatial autocorrelation for the15 dependent variable during both periods. These results imply that the OLS estimates are16 invalid and justify the use of spatial models to address the spatial dependence of the number17 of cumulative confirmed cases of COVID-19.18 The SWM constructed with Baidu population flow data is applied to capture the19 spatial interaction of the dependent variable in our model, while the inverse distance weight20 matrix is used to capture that of our explanatory variables such as socioeconomic factors and21\nnatural meteorological conditions. Following the general-to-specific rule for spatial1 econometric modeling (Elhorst 2014), we apply a two-stage testing procedure to select the2 most appropriate model, with results reported in Table 3.3 First, the Lagrange Multiplier (LM) tests (LM-lag and LM-error) and the robust LM4 tests are applied to spatial models for Period I and Period II, respectively. For Period I, the5 LM test results are all significant at the 99 percent percent confidence level when the6 population-flow-based weight matrix (\ufffd\ufffd) is applied in the spatial model but are all7 insignificant when the inverse geographic distance matrix (\ufffd\ufffd) is used. This indicates that8 when the inverse geographic distance matrix (\ufffd\ufffd) is used for the spatial models, neither9 spatial error model (SEM) nor spatial lag model (SLM) performs better than the non-spatial10 model (i.e., OLS model) for Period I. Meanwhile, because the Moran\u2019s I indices suggest the11 existence of strong spatial autocorrelation for the dependent variable, these insignificant LM12 test results prove that the inverse geographic distance matrix fails to capture the spatial13 autocorrelation identified in Period I. On the other hand, when the population-flow-based14 weight matrix (\ufffd\ufffd) is used, both SEM and SLM outperform the non-spatial model for Period15 I, suggesting \ufffd\ufffd is able to accurately capture the spatial autocorrelation.16 For Period II, the LM-lag and LM-error tests and the robust LM tests using different17 weight matrices (i.e., \ufffd\ufffd and \ufffd\ufffd) are all significant. They suggest that both \ufffd\ufffd and \ufffd\ufffd18 capture the spatial autocorrelation in this Period and that both SLM and SEM outperform the19 non-spatial OLS model.20\nSecond, the Likelihood Ratio (LR) test for the spatial common factors between SLM1 and SDM is conducted to verify if the SDM should be simplified to an SLM (Elhorst 2010;2 Seldadyo, Elhorst and Haan 2010). Based on the LR test results in Table 3, SDM can be3 degenerated to SLM for Period I, while SDM is preferred to SLM for Period II.4\n[Table 2 Results of Global Moran\u2019s I tests of spatial autocorrelation for dependent variables5 based on Population-flow weight matrix]6 7 [Table 3 Results of LM tests, Robust LM tests and LR tests]8 9\n4.4 Results10\nTable 4 reports the empirical results of the two study periods. The spatial models outperform11 the OLS model in terms of the Goodness-of-Fit (R2) values in both periods. Additionally, the12 coefficients of spatially lagged cumulative confirmed cases are significant in models for both13 periods (before and after Wuhan\u2019s lockdown). This indicates that the COVID-19 outbreak in14 a city significantly affected the number of cases in its adjacent cities due to population flow,15 and inversely, was affected by the COVID-19 incidence in its surrounding areas due to the16 spillover effects. Therefore, spatial autocorrelation exists in the number of COVID-1917 confirmed cases across cities and spatial econometric models (SLM and SDM) are more18 effective and reliable than the non-spatial model (OLS model) for analyzing the potential19 determinants of COVID-19 transmission. Additionally, the global Moran\u2019s I test for residuals20 of the spatial econometric models indicates that no significant spatial autocorrelation in21 residuals exists (see Appendix 1).22\n[Table 4 Empirical results for OLS and spatial econometric models]1 2 According to LeSage and Pace (2010), using point estimates of spatial regression3 models to estimate the spatial spillover effects may lead to incorrect conclusions because of4 feedback loop effects. They also pointed out that partial derivative interpretation of the5 impacts from a dependent variable to an independent variable can provide a more valid basis6 to interpret spatial effects. Hence, to reveal the exact spatial spillover effects, we estimate7 each independent variable\u2019s direct, indirect, and total effects in the spatial econometric8 models separately. The decomposed results are illustrated in Table 5.9\n[Table 5 Estimation results for decomposition of the spatial effects]10 11 The results suggest that the total urban population had a positive direct effect on the12 number of cumulative confirmed cases during both periods, indicating that a larger13 population increases the locally confirmed cases in that city after controlling for the effects of14 other factors. In other words, epidemic control is more challenging in larger cities than in15 smaller cities. Specifically, this positive direct effect is stronger after Wuhan\u2019s lockdown.16 One possible reason is that COVID-19 transmission within cities gradually became severe17 during this period and a larger population base implies higher chances of virus transmission.18 Positive indirect impacts of a city\u2019s total population on adjacent cities\u2019 cumulative confirmed19 cases are only found in Period I, which may indicate the effectiveness of nationwide20 prevention and control measures swiftly adopted by other cities after the Wuhan lockdown11.21\n11 After January 24, different levels of prevention and control measures (i.e., the shutdown of public transport and public places, the lock down of residential buildings/neighborhoods, and the set-up of checkpoints to control the population\nGDP per capita shows no direct impact on the local COVID-19 situation during1 Period I, but illustrates significant and positive spillover effects during Period II. This result2 suggests that proximity to economically advanced cities may increase the chances of3 epidemic transmission for surrounding cities. Significant and positive direct effects of4 licensed doctors per capita are identified in the pre-lockdown period (Period I) but not the5 after-lockdown period (Period II). The results for Period I indicates that a 1 percent percent6 rise in licensed doctors per capita was directly associated with a 99.96 percent increase in7 cumulative confirmed cases. While this result may sound counterintuitive, it is likely that8 cities with more medical resources were more effective in terms of diagnosing patients with9\nsymptoms of COVID-19. Conversely, some patients may not have been diagnosed effectively10 in areas with low levels of healthcare. In Period \u2161, with progress in identification techniques11 and enhancement of nationwide publicity about COVID-19, the accuracy of diagnosis in12 most places in Mainland China had improved, and most cities had the resources needed to13 make diagnoses efficiently and correctly. This may explain why the number of licensed14 doctors per capita does not show significant direct impacts in Period II. Additionally, its15 significant and positive indirect impacts during Period I but negative indirect impacts during16 Period II imply that the medical resources of a city have significant spillover effects that help17 nearby cities diagnose and control COVID-19.18 As for the three natural meteorological variables and AQI, only average humidity19 shows significant positive direct effects on the number of cumulative confirmed cases in both20\nentering the city) were implemented by most of the cities, especially for cities in Hubei province and some cities with relatively more confirmed cases like Wenzhou, Hangzhou, and Harbin (Fang, Wang, and Yang 2020).\nperiods. This is consistent with the findings in studies by Do\u011fan et al. (2020), and Chien and1 Chen (2020). Meanwhile, average temperature shows positive direct effects and negative2 indirect effects in Period II. Note that the specific correlation between meteorological3 conditions and the COVID-19 pandemic is still controversial (Harmooshi, Shirbandi, and4 Rahim 2020; McClymont and Hu 2021) and needs to be further explored. Even so, this study5 provides evidence that meteorological variables are significant contributing factors in6 COVID-19 transmission and exhibit spillover effects on the COVID situation in surrounding7 regions.8 One point worth noting is that the index of travel intensity within cities shows no9\nsignificant effects in the Period I model but is found to exert significant and negative direct,10 indirect, and total impacts in the Period II model. The insignificant impact of within-city11 travel flow in the first period may be explained by the lag in COVID-19 transmission from12 Wuhan. That is, in the early stages of the pandemic (i.e., prior to Wuhan\u2019s lockdown), most13 cities only had a small number of confirmed cases so within-city travel flows would have a14 relatively weak impact on the spread of the disease. However, with the increasingly serious15 situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in Period II, local governments began to take different16 control and prevention measures, including suspending public transportation, closing public17 places and factories, and locking down communities. Cities with more severe local outbreaks18 generally implemented more strict control and preventative measures, resulting in lower19 intra-city travel intensity. In addition, the significant spillover effects of within-city travel20 may be explained by policy imitation and referencing between neighboring cities.21\nPopulation outflow from Wuhan is positively associated with local COVID-191 cumulative confirmed cases as well as cases in surrounding cities during both periods. This2 result indicates that population outflow from Wuhan, the outbreak source region, posed high3 risks to destination cities and adjacent cities. This also suggests the lockdown policy4 implemented in the region effectively prevented the further spread of COVID-19, which is5 consistent with the conclusions of studies by Liu et al. (2020), , Qiu, Chen and Shi (2020) and6 Yang et al. (2020).7 Unsurprisingly, the direct and indirect impacts of cumulative confirmed cases in8 Period I are significantly positive in Period II, suggesting that the more cumulative confirmed9\ncases were present in a city before the lockdown of Wuhan, the more serious the outbreak10 situation in the city would be during Period \u2161. A higher initial infection level generally11 means a greater possibility for human-to-human transmissions in the later stage. The strong12 indirect effects further emphasize the necessity of control measures in neighboring cities near13 those hotspots.14\n15\n4.5 SWM performance comparison16\nIn this section, we further compare the performance of the spatial econometric models using17 different SWMs for each period.18 1) The Period I model19\nRegardless of whether the population-flow-based SWM or inverse distance SWM was1 used, the global Moran\u2019s I tests for Period I consistently exhibit significantly positive values2 (see section 4.3), confirming the existence of spatial autocorrelation in the dependent variable.3 However, as mentioned in section 4.3, LM tests and robust LM tests indicate that spatial4 models (e.g., SLM, SEM) based on inverse distance SWM fail to capture such spatial5 autocorrelation in the dependent variable and these models perform no better than the OLS6 model. On the other hand, spatial models using population-flow-based SWM for the spatial7 lagged dependent variable successfully address the spatial autocorrelation issue, with the8 model residuals exhibiting no systematic spatial pattern at a 95 percent confidence level (see9\nAppendix 1).10\n2) The Period II model11\nAs discussed earlier, our Period II spatial econometric model uses12 population-flow-based SWM for the spatially lagged dependent variable and inverse distance13 SWM for the spatially lagged independent variable. To validate the model results, we further14 estimate the Period II model using only the inverse distance SWM for both spatially lagged15 dependent and independent variables and compare the performance of these two models16 (results provided in Appendix 2).17\nCompared with the model using only inverse distance SWM, the model employing18 mixed SWMs (i.e., inverse distance SWM for the independent variables and19 population-flow-based SWM for the dependent variable) has a higher R-square. Although20\nthere is no major difference across the two models in terms of the significance level of1 explanatory variables, the decomposition of direct and indirect effects does suggest that the2 model using only inverse distance SWM fails to capture the indirect effects of most3 explanatory variables, whereas the model employing mixed SWMs has done well. These4 comparisons thus confirm the robustness of our results.5\n6\n4.6 Additional robustness checks7\nFinally, we further conduct two robustness checks using: 1) symmetric8 population-flow-based SWM12 derived from the average of population move-in and9\nmove-out within each city pair; 2) (asymmetric) population-flow-based SWM with missing10 values imputed by a gravity model (Wilson 1974)13, rather than the inverse distance weighted11 interpolation. Compared with the original asymmetric population-flow-based SWM12\n12 Based on our original population-flow-based SWM (before normalization), we calculate the value of element in symmetric population-flow-based SWM as:\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd = 1 2 \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd +\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd = \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\nwhere the \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd is the spatial weight of unit i towards unit j, and \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd is the spatial weight of unit j towards unit i; \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd is the index that reflects the volume of population traveling from city i to city j ; \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd_\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd is the index that reflects the volume of population traveling from city j to city i .\n13 The gravity model used in this paper can be expressed as follows:\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd = \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\n\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\nwhere the \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd is the spatial weight of unit i towards unit j; \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd (\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd) is the GDP of city i (city j); \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd (\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd) is the total population of city i (city j); \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\ufffd \ufffd\u210e\ufffd geographic distance between city i and city j. We first select city-pairs with accurate move-out indices in our dataset to estimate \ufffd, \ufffd, \ufffd, \ufffd, \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd \ufffd based on the equation above. We then use the estimation results to impute move-out indices for city-pairs without accurate move-out indices.\nelaborated in previous sections, the estimation results using these two alternative SWMs1 show no major differences in terms of the statistical significance and the coefficient estimates2 of key explanatory variables but have slightly lower model R-squares (around 5 percent3 lower) (see Appendices 3 and 4). These comparisons suggest that spatial econometric models4 using the original asymmetric population-flow-based SWM produce robust results with better5 goodness of fit, and thus better capture the role of spatial interactions in COVID-196 transmission.7\n8\n5. Conclusions9\nThis paper proposes an innovative method of constructing SWM based on the real-time10 population flow data into spatial econometric models. Unlike traditional SWMs which only11 consider geographic or economic proximity, the matrix in this study introduces travel volume12 as the measure of connection between city pairs, aiming to better approximate the impact of13 social interactions. City pairs with more intensive travel interactions are defined as closely14 connected even if they are geographically far from each other, such as in the case of Sanya15 and Beijing. Incorporating the population-flow-based SWM into spatial econometric16 modeling improves classical spatial economic theory by more accurately approximating the17 spatial interaction processes underlying the spillover effects of spatial outcomes. The18 proposed method can be applied to a wide range of economic and social research, including19 environment, public health, demography, and social welfare studies.20\nIn the application part of this study, we adopt spatial econometric models based on the1 population-flow-based SWM and traditional geographical distance-based SWM to examine2 the potential transmission determinants of COVID-19 in Mainland China. Our sample is from3 January 11 to February 25, 2020, covering the critical episodes of both the initial spread and4 the peak of infections before the first imported case being reported in Mainland China.5 Considering the changes in population flow from the epicenter of the outbreak as well as the6 widespread use of prevention and control measures, we divide the whole research period into7 two subperiods using the date of Wuhan lockdown (January 23, 2020). The results reveal that8 the advanced health care system played an essential role in the early diagnosis and control of9\nthe epidemic. We also find that spatial autocorrelation should be considered when exploring10 the correlation between meteorological conditions and diseases. Furthermore, the results11 confirm the significant time-lagged effects of traveler outflows from the outbreak source12 region on pandemic transmission (Qiu, Chen and Shi, 2020). Interestingly, according to the13 results of the Period II model, we find that the population outflow from Wuhan is14 significantly associated with a higher number of local cumulative confirmed cases as well as15 the number of cases in surrounding cities due to positive spillover effects. These results16 emphasize the importance of checking the entire records of travel routes for local17 governments.18 There are two limitations in this study. First, due to data availability, we use only Baidu19 population flow data as our data source of the population flow between and within cities.20 Although it has been demonstrated that Baidu population flow data captures the real-time21\nactual population flow through Baidu LBS with relative accuracy, this still excludes the1 movement of those people who do not use electronic devices, such as elderly people and2 young children. Second, even though the data of over 200 cities can be obtained from the3 Baidu Migration Platform, the precise moving-out indices of each source-city are only4 available for the top 100 destinations. As a result, the data in this paper may not accurately5 reflect smaller flows of population between cities. Hence, the analytical approach of this6 paper can still be extended when more reliable data resources become available for future7 research.8\nReferences1 Ahlfeldt, G., and A. Feddersen. 2017.
