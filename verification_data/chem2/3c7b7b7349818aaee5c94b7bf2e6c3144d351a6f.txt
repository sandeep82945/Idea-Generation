"The results of this study therefore indicate that secoiridoids contribute strongly to the antioxidant capacity and oxidative stability of ‘Corbella’ EVOOs, and that oils with a high content of oleacein and oleocanthal will be more stable and have a longer shelf life. According to this study, storing the olives at environmental temperature overnight and performing the malaxation at least at 23 ◦C for 40–50 min (depending on the temperature), will increase the oleacein and oleocanthal content and thus the oxidative stability of EVOOs. These findings signify a notable advancement and hold substantial utility and significance in addressing and enhancing EVOO stability."
