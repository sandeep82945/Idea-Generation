    "abstractText": "Despite the growing concern with students\u2019 mental health education, there are neither extensive research on stressors of psychological crisis, nor targeted research on the psychological crisis warning of college students with different levels of psychological crisis. To solve the problem, this paper aims to explore the psychological crisis warning and physical education (PE) intervention of college students based on artificial neural network (ANN). Firstly, the important evaluation indexes were determined for psychological crisis warning of college students; according to the adverse reactions and performance of college students in physiology, cognition, emotion, and behavior, the index data were processed by partial least squares (PLS) method. Next, a psychological crisis warning model was developed based on the optimized ANN: the harmony search (HS) algorithm was improved based on the differential evolutionary (DE) algorithm, and then used to optimize the backpropagation neural network (BPNN). The proposed model was proved feasible and effective through experiments.

            "text": "College students generally have to face the triple pressures of school work, employment, and life; therefore, when their ideality collides with social reality, their psychology is prone to lose balance and generate psychological crises [1-6]. Now, the public has paid more attention to the mental health education of students, and there are more discussions on the mental health education of undergraduates and junior college students [7-13].\nCollege students\u2019 psychological crisis develops in three stages: the initial stage, the developing stage, and the severe stage [14-15]. For the different stages, there\u2019re certain differences in the adverse reactions and performance of the psychological crisis of college students. Starting from the source of stressors and with the help of effective identification methods, we could discover college students with psychological prob-\niJET \u2012 Vol. 17, No. 02, 2022 59\nlems as early as possible and give scientific interventions to adjust their mental health status and help them restore balance in their psychology.\nXiong [16] proposed that designing and developing big data analysis prototype systems for college students' mental health education could predict the trend of college students' psychological behavior; and formulating personalized emergency management mechanisms for college students' psychological crisis could effectively improve the real-time performance and effectiveness of the management of college students\u2019 psychological crisis. Li and Wang [17] explored the repetitive feature of psychological crisis, and discussed a few aspects including the separation and integration of physical effect, the boundary of strong and weak conditions, the regulation or intermediary mechanisms, and the innovation of experimental paradigms. Huang [18] proposed a psychological crisis warning system based on the C4.5 decision tree algorithm; in the paper, the classification rules generated by the C4.5 decision tree was fully applied based on quantified mental state of students to facilitate the showing of the relationship between students\u2019 mental health indicators and their psychological crisis. Frangos et al. [19] discussed the influence of economic crisis and corruption of the Greek political system on the thinking, lifestyle, and academic progress of modern young Greeks; the negative influence mainly includes the common feeling of abandonment, pessimism, negative beliefs, nihilistic attitudes, and lack of self-confidence, etc. Based on a classification of college students\u2019 psychological crises and the nature of crisis events.\nIn summary, although many field scholars have conducted in-depth research on psychological crisis warning of college students, the research scope of the stressors of psychological crisis is not wide enough, and insufficient consideration has been paid to the different emphases on the psychological crisis warning of college students with different levels of psychological crisis, as a result, the change pattern of college students\u2019 psychological crisis with the development of psychological problems couldn\u2019t be well investigated. To this end, this paper aims to research the early warning of college students' psychological crisis and PE intervention based on ANN, and the main content of this paper includes the following aspects: 1) Take the adverse reactions and performance of college students in physiology, cognition, emotion, and behavior as important evaluation indexes of psychological crisis warning; 2) Process the data of the evaluation indexes based on the PLS method; 3) Build the psychological crisis warning model based on improved ANN, elaborate on the principles of the improvement and the HS algorithm, and give the execution flow of the BPNN optimized by the improved algorithm. In the last part, this paper used experimental results to verify the effectiveness of the proposed model."

            "text": "Combining with the characteristics of college students' psychological crisis and the traits of college students, we can know that college students' psychological crisis has the features of event suddenness, painfulness, helplessness, dangerousness, and dual effect. According to the type of stressors, the psychological crisis of college students\n60 http://www.i-jet.org\ncan be divided into several types: such as the interpersonal relationship type, development prospect type, family and economy type, study and life type, heterosexual relationship type, and physical health type, etc.\nAs the most important link in the research of the early warning of college students' psychological crisis, the selection of evaluation indexes plays a direct decisive role in the effectiveness of the psychological crisis warning model. Due to the suddenness feature of college students' psychological crisis and the seriousness feature of the consequences, the normal law of study and life of college students can be easily broken, so the adverse reactions and performance of college students in physiology, cognition, emotion, and behavior can be taken as important evaluation indexes to identify whether psychological crisis warning and PE intervention need to be carried out on a college student. In terms of physiology, the main symptoms include decreased body immunity, loss of appetite, insomnia, and sense of suppression in the chest, etc. In terms of cognition, the main symptoms include retardation of thought, inattention, illusions, and memory deterioration, etc. In terms of emotion, the main manifestations include anger, despair, depression, fear, anxiety, indifference, solitary, and depression, etc. In terms of behavior change, the main manifestations include evasion, denial, attack, refusal to help, and use alcohol to relieve sorrow, etc. For the college student psychological crisis warning models of different stages, the emphases of the research on evaluation indexes are different. For students with initial-stage psychological crisis, the research emphasizes on indexes that can reflect recognition and emotions; while for students with severe-stage psychological crisis, the research emphasizes on indexes that can reflect their physiology and behavioral changes.\nWhen constructing regression formula using the PLS method, we only need to select the first k components of q components o1, o2,\u2026,oq to obtain a regression model with an ideal prediction level. The number of required principal components k can be determined by the cross-validity test.\nAt first, the first i observation points (i = 1, 2,..., m) of the evaluation indexes of college students\u2019 psychological crisis were deleted, and the PLS regression method was adopted to build a model for the remaining m-k observation points. Second, the regression equation fitted after selecting f components was studied, and the i-th observation point that had been deleted was substituted into the constructed regression equation to obtain the predicted value of bj(j=1, 2,\u2026,e) on the i-th observation point. Third, above calculation was repeated for different evaluation index observation points, based on the calculation results, the sum of squared prediction errors of the jth dependent variable bj(j=1, 2,\u2026,e) when extracting f components could be calculated using Formula 1 below:\n(1)\nThe sum of squared prediction errors of B=(b1,\u2026,be)T can be calculated by Formula 2:\n(2)\n( ) ( ) ( )( ) ( ) 2\n1 , 1,2,...,\nm\nj ij i j i SFE f b b f j e = = - =\u00e5 !\n( ) ( )1 e jj SFE f SFE f = =\u00e5\niJET \u2012 Vol. 17, No. 02, 2022 61\nIn addition, all the sample points of the score data of evaluation indexes were used to construct a regression equation containing f components. The predicted value of the i-th evaluation index score data sample point was recorded as \u1e03ij(f), then Formula 3 gives the calculation formula of the sum of squared errors of yibi:\n(3)\nThe sum of squared errors of B could be calculated using Formula 4:\n(4)\nWhen SFE(f) reaches the minimum value, the number of components needed to be extracted to construct the model at this time is f. Under general conditions, SFE(f) is always greater than SQ(f), and SQ(f) is always less than SQ(f-1), so when extracting the principal components, the smaller the value of SFE(f)/SQ(f-1), the better. Generally, the preset threshold is set to 0.1, then there is:\n(5)\nThe cross-validity can be defined by Formula 6:\n(6)\nFor the observation points of the evaluation indexes of college students\u2019 psychological crisis, before the end of each round of calculation, the predicted values of the sample points need to be subject to cross-validity test. If the cross-validity obtained in calculation of the f-th iteration is less than 0.081, it can be considered that the constructed model has reached the accuracy requirement, and the iteration of the algorithm can be terminated. If the cross-validity is greater than 0.081, it means that the component of extracted in the f-th iteration has a significant marginal contribution, and the calculation of the f+1-th iteration is required."

This paper adopted two methods of binomial crossover and exponential crossover to perform the crossover operations.\nIn a binomial crossover operation, at first, for each variable, a random number s within the value range of [0,1] is generated.

That is, in the original improvisation C3 tuning stage, a new tone C3* was generated through two pairs of differential mutation operations of the mutation mechanism of DE algorithm, and C3 was replaced by C3*. Assuming ND represents normal distribution, the formation of C3* was divided into two steps, at first, the differential mutation vector ADM shown as Formula 23 was generated:\nADM (\u00b5) = ND (0.45, 0.35) \u00d7 [(as1 \u02d7 as2) + (as3 \u02d7 as4)]\nS1, S2, S3, S4 \u2208 (1, SMB) (24)\nwhere, ADM contains two differential mutation pairs.

Table 1 summarizes the regression coefficients of evaluation indexes to the components.\nThe explanatory ability and cumulative explanatory ability of PLS components to dependent variables could be obtained through calculation, in this paper, the explanatory ability of the 2 components extracted by PLS was 0.8242 and 0.1346 respectively, and the cumulative explanatory ability was 0.9588, that is, the extracted components can explain 95.88% of the dependent variables, so the operation of the optimal PLS components was scientific and reasonable.\nIn order to verify the superiority of the improved algorithm, this paper designed several reference models (Reference model 1: optimized by traditional HS algorithm; Reference model 2: optimized by improved HS algorithm; Reference model 3: optimized by the hybrid algorithm of traditional HS algorithm and DE algorithm) to conduct comparative experiments on the reference models and the proposed model. During the experiment, for the prediction of each problem of college student's psychological crisis, the algorithms before and after optimization were executed for 30 times each, and each time, the initialized parameter values were the same. Meanwhile, for the above 5 test functions, the maximum calculation times Nmax-c and the minimum error function value Vmin-e were set as two algorithm termination conditions, based on Nmax-c and Vmin-e, the optimization performance of the algorithms could be evaluated.\nFigure5 gives the test results of different algorithms, showing the distribution of experience cumulative functions of test functions in case of fixed dimensions with respect to different algorithms, and the accuracy of the number of successes in predicting the psychological crisis of college students was 10-8. According to the figure, after all models went through 8000-20000 iterations, the proposed model outperformed the other three algorithm models.\nThis paper used the train() function to train the constructed neural network model. Before training, the maximum training times and learning rate of the network were set to 1000 and 0.01 respectively, the target threshold of output errors was set as 10-6, and other parameters took default values. Figure 6 shows the error curves of the training process of the constructed neural network. According to the figure, the constructed neural network exhibited good convergence performance and can meet the requirements for the early warning of college students\u2019 psychological crisis.\nThis paper used the sim() function to simulate the trained neural network, then, the simulation results after subject to denormalization operation were compared with the\n70 http://www.i-jet.org\noriginal predicted data, and the comparison results are given in Figure 7.
