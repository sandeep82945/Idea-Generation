The Cr(VI) removal capacity of Fe-BC was concurrently controlled by impregnated iron species (Fe0/Fe2+/Fe3+), carbon properties, and iron-carbon interactions, while the current labscale research could hardly untangle the overall relationships with the Cr(VI) removal experiments of one or several Fe-BCs under different research frameworks. Herein, we investigated the impacts of various microscopic material properties of Fe-BC on aqueous Cr(VI) removal by ML approach and highlighted the variations of biochar properties after iron impregnation. Our results suggested that the direct impacts of impregnated-iron contents on the Cr(VI) removal were limited, possibly related to undistinguished Fe species in the ML models, in which the roles of different iron species on Cr(VI) removal might be counteracted. Instead, the impacts of impregnated iron on the Cr(VI) removal were embodied indirectly by altering the biochar properties. Surface oxygen-containing functional groups (SOFGs) contents on biochar played a pivotal role in Cr(VI) removal according to the ML models. The condensed polyaromatic carbon matrices of BC and Fe-BC with a high content of non-polar carbon were also proved to be conducive to Cr(VI) removal. The ML models developed in this study consider surface functionalities information of BC and Fe-BC and offer a more accurate prediction for Cr(VI) removal, and the information mining behind models can act as a vital reference for the rational design of engineered biochar to remove aqueous Cr(VI).

            "text": "Chromium (Cr) is a toxic pollutant that mainly derives from industrial activities such as\nmining, leather tannery, and metallurgy [1, 2]. Cr primarily exists as two species in the environment, soluble hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI)] (i.e., HCrO4 -, Cr2O7 2- and CrO4 2-) with higher toxicity and trivalent chromium [Cr(III)] with less hazard and mobility [3]. Therefore, turning Cr(VI) into Cr(III) by a reduction process followed by Cr(III) sorption/precipitation is a promising strategy to immobilize Cr(VI) pollutants in the environment [4-6]. Among various methods, biochar (BC) and iron-biochar (Fe-BC) have been demonstrated to be promising materials for the remediation of Cr(VI)-containing wastewater due to many advantages, including high redox potential, abundant sorption sites, ready availability of renewable feedstock, and easy separation/recycling [7, 8]. The ever-increasing number of articles has also proved the significant prospects of removing Cr(VI) by BC and Fe-BC (Fig. S1).\nFe-BC can be synthesized by using BC as a porous carbon skeleton to disperse and\nstabilize iron particles [8]. The removal of Cr(VI) with Fe-BC was concurrently influenced by biochar (e.g., surface functional groups and porous structure characteristics) and impregnated iron minerals (e.g., contents and species of iron minerals) [7, 9]. Interactions between biochar and iron minerals would further influence the properties of both carbon and iron phases in the Fe-BC. For instance, impregnated iron can alter the surface chemistry and porous structure of biochar support [7], which is critical for the Cr(VI) removal process. The dissolutionprecipitation processes of iron will also be affected by the biochar matrices [10, 11], and the dissolved iron often manifests higher reactivity for Cr(VI) removal [12]. If the reciprocal\nactions between iron species and carbon structure are ignored, some contrasting conclusions about the roles of iron on Cr(VI) removal by Fe-BC would be drawn in different experiments. For example, the inhibition of Cr(VI) reduction by Fe-BC was reported due to surface coverage and oxidizing capacity of iron [12], while the shuttling effect and reduction reactivity of iron were observed to enhance Cr(VI) removal by Fe-BC [13]. Therefore, there is an urgent need for an overall investigation into the influences of various factors on Cr(VI) removal capacity by Fe-BC under identical assessment frameworks, and the associated influences of impregnated iron on biochar properties should be properly recognized. The common controlvariable experimental methods are time-consuming and costly, limiting the holistic exploration of a wide range of factors. Moreover, individual lab-scale research could hardly untangle the overall relationships in the Cr(VI) removal with one or several Fe-BC under different experimental frameworks.\nWith the accumulation of experimental data on Cr(VI) removal by BC and Fe-BC,\nmachine learning (ML) can serve as an effective tool to explore the multivariate relationships by building accurate prediction models [14-16]. The ML models can also identify the relative importance and influential modes of these factors on the targets based on the rapid development of interpretable ML algorithms (e.g., random forest (RF)) [17]. Recent studies have confirmed the competence of ML in predicting the adsorption capacity of metals and organic pollutants on carbonaceous materials based on the adsorption conditions, adsorbents properties, and nature of contaminants [18-21], and mining information from the \u201cblack-box\u201d models [19].\nNevertheless, the available ML research primarily focused on the easily accessible\nmacroscopic properties of BC, such as the proportion of bulk element compositions [18, 22],\nwhile the microscopic surface characteristics (e.g., surface elemental compositions and relative proportion of different surface functional groups) were overlooked. Such microscopic information of biochar surface is undeniably critical for pollutant removal, especially for the Cr(VI) removal through the adjoint redox and sorption processes [3, 23]. It has been demonstrated that the adsorption capacity of biochar for pollutants displayed significantly higher correlation coefficients with the surface polarity (i.e., (N+O)/C) as indicated by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) than the bulk polarity determined with elemental analyzer [24]. Moreover, the relative proportion of surface oxygen-containing functional groups (SOFGs, e.g., distinguishing C\u2212O and C=O moieties) may provide more explicit information about Cr(VI) removal than the total O moiety that is collectively represented by the bulk oxygen content on biochar [25]. Another limitation of current ML models may reside in using the factors (e.g., ion exchange capacity) that are not suitable to be directly manipulated as model inputs [18], which fail to offer a detailed guidance for biochar preparation.\nIn view of the limitations of experimental research in dealing with multifactorial\nrelationships, the lack of microscopic biochar properties considered in current ML studies, and our hypothesis-driven demand of exploring the impacts of iron impregnation on biochar properties, we developed new ML models with RF algorithm and literature summary in this study to: (i) predict the Cr(VI) removal capacity of pristine BC and Fe-BC based on microscopic biochar properties and reaction conditions; (ii) evaluate the direct role of the iron content in the removal capacity of Cr(VI); and (iii) estimate the indirect impact of iron on Cr(VI) removal through the variation of biochar properties including surface chemical functionalities and pore structure properties. The results of this study can provide new insights into Cr(VI)\nremoval by BC and Fe-BC, especially for elucidating the significance of microscopic biochar properties and the interactions between the iron and biochar phases."

            "heading": "2.1. Data collection",
            "text": "Two categories of experimental data related to BC and Fe-BC were impartially collected\nfrom the published articles (a total of 153 journal publications) over the past decade without initial bias regarding data validity, including (i) the removal capacity of pristine BC and Fe-BC for aqueous Cr(VI), and (ii) the properties comparison of Fe-BC and corresponding pristine BC after iron impregnation. The data were directly obtained from tables or extracted from figures in the publications with Plot Digitizer 2.6.8. The Fe-BC produced by the following three widely used synthesis methods (Fig. 1) was focused in our study [5, 10]: (i) direct pyrolysis or hydrothermal carbonization of iron-soaked biomass (namely, Pre-), in which the pyrolysis and iron impregnation could be completed in one step and the physicochemical properties of FeBC could be controlled by the operating conditions and feedstock selection [9]; (ii) coprecipitation of BC and ferric/ferrous salts in an alkali solution (namely, Post-), in which the performance of Fe-BC was influenced by the properties of pre-synthesized BC and the precipitation conditions of iron [26]; (iii) liquid-phase reduction of iron by borohydride on BC surface (namely, Post/R-), in which the generation of Fe0 by reducing agents could significantly improve the reducing capacity of Fe-BC [27, 28]. The detailed references of these collected data are summarized in the Supporting Information (SI, Table S1).\nTo investigate the specific roles of microscopic properties on the removal of Cr(VI), ten\nfactors influencing the Cr(VI) removal capacity (R, mg/g) using BC and Fe-BC were considered and divided into three categories: (i) surface chemistry characteristics from XPS analysis, including the atomic percentages of carbon (C, at.%) and iron (Fe, at.%), the atomic ratio of oxygen to carbon (O/C), and the relative proportions of non-polar C (NPC, e.g., C\u2212C, C=C, and \u03c0-\u03c0* transition), C\u2212O (e.g., phenolic, alcoholic, and etheric), C=O (e.g., carbonyl, quinone, carboxyl or ester) as determined by C1s XPS; (ii) textural properties, i.e., surface area calculated by Brunauer-Emmett-Teller model (SBET, m 2/g); and (iii) reaction conditions, including solution pH (pHsol), temperature (T, \u2103), and initial concentration ratio of Cr(VI) to BC or Fe-BC dosage (C0, mg/g). Meanwhile, the data on physicochemical properties of Fe-BC and the corresponding pristine BC, including O/C, C\u2212O/C=O (i.e., the ratio of C\u2212O to C=O), NPC, and SBET, were collected to compare the variations of biochar properties before and after iron impregnation. 2.2. Machine learning models with random forest algorithm\nTwo ML models were developed (Fig. 1) with particular focus on different material\nproperties. The basic properties (BP) of BC and Fe-BC (i.e., C, O/C, Fe, and SBET) and reaction conditions (i.e., pHsol, T, C0) were used to construct the Model BP, while the detailed surface functionalities (SF) information of BC and Fe-BC including NPC, C\u2212O, C=O instead of C and O/C were introduced in Model SF. It should be noted that each set of data contained valid values for all the variables in the datasets for each ML model, while the ones have been excluded in the case of missing data [29]. A total of 201 sets of data and 224 sets of data were used in Model BP and Model SF, respectively. Twenty sets of Cr(VI) removal data by BC or Fe-BC were randomly selected from common sets in the two models as the test group to directly\ncompare their prediction performances, while the remaining data in each model were randomly divided into the training group and the validation group with a ratio of 80:20. The data in the training group was used to train the ML models by RF algorithm, which is an ensemble ML method by averaging the performances of decision trees on various sub-sample of datasets (i.e., bagging theory) to improve the predictive accuracy and control over-fitting [17, 30]. The tuned hyper-parameters in RF algorithm include the number of trees, the maximum depth of each tree, the number of features required when looking for the best split, the minimum number of samples required to split an internal node, and the minimum number of samples required to be at a leaf node [19, 29]. The parameters could be adjusted using the methods of trial-and-error and grid search according to the feedback of regression coefficient (R2) or root-mean-square error (RMSE) in the validation group [31]. Finally, the independent data in the test group were introduced into the optimal ML models to make an unbiased evaluation for model accuracy with R2 and RMSE (Text S1). 2.3. Relative importance analysis of features and partial dependence plot analysis\nRelative importance analysis of features and partial dependence plot (PDP) analysis were\nperformed to extract and mine the underlying information from the two well-developed RF models. Feature importance analysis is assessed by calculating the weighted impurity decrease of all nodes and averaging over all decision trees, which can help us understand the contribution of particular input variables to the variation of the target variables [29, 32]. However, the information derived from the rank of feature importance is limited. The dependence relationships of the target variables on important input variables are more significant, which can be visualized by the PDP analysis [33]. However, it should be noted that the PDP analysis\nis more accurate in the data-intensive region. An overinterpretation of PDP analysis in the region with insufficient or almost no data should be avoided according to the density of pikes on the x-axis. The ML models were built with the Scikit-learn library in Python 3.8, and the plotting was performed using Matplotlib (version 3.4.2)."

            "text": "into ML models\nThe optimal hyper-parameters of Model BP and Model SF are shown in SI (Table S2)\naccording to the R2 and RMSE of the validation group, while the predicted removal capacity versus the experimentally determined values are plotted in Fig. 2. The results suggested that Model BP, which was developed based on basic surface properties of BC and Fe-BC (i.e., C, O/C, Fe, and SBET) and reaction conditions, could predict the removal capacity for aqueous Cr(VI) with R2 of 0.889 and RMSE of 13.8 mg/g in the test group (Fig. 2a). The acceptable predictive power of Model BP could reflect the reasonable use of surface chemical information from XPS data as model inputs [34]. Moreover, the prediction accuracy could be further improved when the relative proportion of surface functional groups was introduced into Model SF (i.e., NPC, C\u2212O, C=O, Fe, SBET, and reaction conditions). The predicted error (i.e., RMSE) in the test group of Model SF decreased by 21.7% compared to the Model BP (Fig. 2b). These findings emphasized the significant roles of specific surface functional groups in predicting the removal capacity of BC and Fe-BC for aqueous Cr(VI). Relative importance analysis and PDP analysis were subsequently conducted to evaluate the roles of different factors in the ML\nmodels. 3.2. Limited direct impacts of impregnated iron content on Cr(VI) removal\nThe iron content of Fe-BC showed an upward tendency to the removal capacity of Cr(VI)\naccording to the one-factor PDP analysis (Fig. 3a), which could be attributed to the reduction of Cr(VI) by low-valent iron (i.e., Fe2+ and Fe0) and the enhanced electron transport by iron redox cycles [7, 35]. However, the relative importance of iron content was merely ranked as the third and fourth in Models BP and SF, respectively (Fig. 4). One of the critical reasons was that the total iron content could not precisely reflect the roles of different iron species on FeBC surface (e.g., Fe3O4, Fe2O3, Fe 2+, Fe3+, and Fe0) in removing aqueous Cr(VI), such that the roles of different iron species may be counteracted and thus overlooked by the ML models. For example, Fe2+ and Fe0 with high reducing capacity can reduce Cr(VI) to Cr(III), while Fe3+ might inhibit the Cr(VI) reduction due to the consumption of electrons from biochar [7, 10]. In addition, the excessive iron content in some cases would result in iron aggregation and surface coverage of biochar, which might hinder the Cr(VI) removal by Fe-BC [12]. It should be noted that the increased tendency of the removal capacity due to the increase of iron content (Fig. 3a) represented the scenario of relatively lower iron content (i.e., 0-8.3 at.%) because the data points of iron content above 8.3 at.% were sparse. Future work should focus on different ranges of iron contents and more variable iron species in the biochar composite, in which twocompartment analysis (i.e., carbon structure and iron minerals) can be considered in the scenario with high iron contents. Although the direct impact of iron contents on the Cr(VI) removal is relatively limited, the indirect effects of iron by altering biochar properties could be more crucial for Cr(VI) removal capacity, as discussed in the following section."

            "text": "properties\nImpregnating biochar with iron could indirectly affect Cr(VI) removal by changing the\ntotal SOFGs content, proportions of different SOFGs, carbon structure, and surface porous properties of biochar [7]. Therefore, we scrutinized the shifts of O/C, C\u2212O/C=O, NPC, SBET after iron impregnation (Fig. 5), the impacts of SOFGs, carbon structure, and surface area on the Cr(VI) removal were evaluated based on the ML results. 3.3.1 Critical roles of SOFGs in Cr(VI) removal\nFig. 5a suggests that the majority of Fe-BC had higher O/C ratio than pristine BC for the\nthree synthetic methods, in terms of bulk or surface elemental composition measured by the elemental analyzer and XPS results, respectively. The increased O/C ratio of Fe-BC may be primarily attributed to the incorporation of iron (hydr)oxide on the biochar surface [36]. The impregnation of iron would also increase the relative contents of SOFGs on the biochar surface such as -OH and -COOH due to the oxidation capacity of iron with the following reactions (Eq. 1-3) [36], where the SOFGs were critical for removing Cr(VI) based on the ML results.\n2Fe(OH)3 + \u2212CH3 \u2192 2Fe(OH)2 + \u2212CH2\u2212OH + H2O (1) 4Fe(OH)3 + \u2212CH2\u2212OH \u2192 4Fe(OH)2 + \u2212COOH + 3H2O (2) 2Fe(OH)2 + \u2212CH2\u2212OH \u2192 2Fe + \u2212COOH + 3H2O (3)\nIn Model BP, the O/C ratio of BC and Fe-BC was the most critical factor influencing the\nCr(VI) removal capacity (Fig. 4a) because the oxygen-containing moieties such as C\u2212O and C=O on biochar surface could concurrently contribute to the reduction and adsorption of Cr(VI) [10]. According to the corresponding PDP analysis (Fig. 3b), the dependence of the removal\ncapacity on O/C could be further divided into three stages:\n(i) The removal capacity decreased slightly with the increase of O/C ratio when O/C\nwas less than ~0.24 (Stage I). The low O/C ratio in BC and Fe-BC resulted from the formation of well-developed graphitic carbon structures as the corresponding carbon content in the biochar was larger than 80% by tracing the collected dataset. The local highest point of Cr(VI) removal capacity at Stage I was found in the case of the lowest O/C ratio, which may be attributed to the highest amount of electrondonating carbon defects on the condensed polyaromatic carbon matrices [7, 37]. The influence of the carbon structure and carbon defects on the Cr(VI) removal is discussed in Section 3.3.2.\n(ii) The removal capacity significantly increased with the increased O/C ratio from\n~0.24 to ~0.32 (Stage II). At this stage, a considerable amount of SOFGs was found with a high O/C ratio, suggesting that the aliphatic carbon was the vital carbon species in the biochar. The SOFGs became the main immobilizing moieties at this stage to immobilize Cr(VI) via direct complexation and electron donating as well as indirect electron mediating [25, 38, 39]. The \u201cV\u201d transition (i.e., first decrease and then increase) of Cr(VI) removal potential with the increase of O/C ratio showed by our ML models may provide a critical reference for the design of engineered biochar in the Cr(VI) decontamination.\n(iii) The removal capacity decreased with the increase of O/C ratio when it was higher\nthan ~0.32 (Stage III), which may be attributed to the poorly-developed biochar structure (C < 65%) and less accessible active sites on the biochar surface [19]. It\nis noted that the minor variation of the PDP curve may result from the sparse data points when O/C ratio was higher than 0.9 [40].\nThe relative proportion of different SOFGs also changed after iron impregnation. Most\nFe-BC, especially the Fe-BC prepared by the Pre- and Post-methods, showed lower C\u2212O/C=O than pristine BC (Fig. 5b). Reduction of iron with biochar oxidation occurs during the pyrolysis process (Pre- method) or the post-impregnation process (Post- method), thus producing a higher proportion of oxidative SOFGs (i.e., \u2212C=O and \u2212COOH) [41]. By contrast, partial FeBC produced by Post/R- method showed a higher C\u2212O/C=O due to the use of reductants such as NaBH4, which provided the reducing condition for the reduction of \u2212C=O to \u2212C\u2212O [42].\nIn terms of the shift of C\u2212O/C=O after iron impregnation, the relationship between Cr(VI)\nremoval capacity and SOFGs was further explored by distinguishing the relative proportions of C\u2212O and C=O in Model SF. The results indicated that the relative importance of C\u2212O was higher than that of C=O (Fig. 4b). In detail, the removal capacity of Cr(VI) slightly fluctuated with the increase of C\u2212O when it was less than ~29% based on the PDP curve (Fig. 6a), while a significant increase was found when the proportion of C\u2212O was increased from ~29% to ~38%, similar to that of O/C variation at Stage II (Fig. 3b&6a). Our results implied that the role of C\u2212O during Cr(VI) removal could be highlighted when the density of C\u2212O on the biochar surface was above ~29%. The presence of C\u2212O could directly act as the electrondonating moieties for the reduction of Cr(VI) to Cr(III) [43, 44], which has been proved by the remarkable consumption of C\u2212O groups in biochar after Cr(VI) removal [3, 25]. Moreover, C\u2212O in Fe-BC could couple with C=O or iron species to form redox cycles, and thus indirectly facilitate the Cr(VI) reduction [7]. However, the optimal proportion of C\u2212O (i.e., from ~29%\nto ~38%) for removing aqueous Cr(VI) has not been identified or specified in the literature, requiring more experimental and theoretical research to verify in the future studies.\nBy comparison, the relative importance of C=O was lower by ~16% than that of C\u2212O\n(Fig. 4b). The higher importance of C\u2212O than C=O in biochar for Cr(VI) may be related to the higher reduction capacity of C\u2212O [38]. The impact patterns of C\u2212O and C=O on the Cr(VI) removal capacity were also different (Fig. 6a&b). The PDP curve of C=O showed a direct increase in Cr(VI) removal with the increasing content of C=O until the proportion of C=O reached ~25%, followed by a decreasing trend. The C=O groups in the form of the carbonyl or carboxylic groups can be protonated in acidic environments, which can directly coordinate with the negatively charged Cr(VI) species by electrostatic attraction or interact with oxygen in HCrO4 - and Cr2O7 2- by hydrogen bonding [45, 46]. However, C=O as an electron-lacking moiety is more inclined to accept electrons [47], so that the continuous increase of C=O may weaken the redox reaction of biochar for Cr(VI) to Cr(III) and eventually decrease the removal capacity of Cr(VI) [38]. Meanwhile, the continuous increase of C=O might also correspond to the possible decrease of relative proportion of C\u2212O, which had a more vital role in Cr(VI) removal than C=O (Fig. 4b). The turning point (i.e., ~25%) of C\u2212O in Cr(VI) removal is a new observation revealed by our ML models, which may need further verification for the future design of engineered biochar.\nIn short, the O/C and C-O of BC and Fe-BC were crucial to Cr(VI) removal based on the\nML model analysis. Iron impregnation with all three synthesis methods improved the O/C, but the Post/R- method appeared to be more liable to increasing C\u2212O/C=O than Pre- and Postmethods (Fig. 5). However, the commonly used reductants (e.g., NaBH4 and KBH4) in the\nPost/R-method are regarded as hazardous substances [48], and thus the exploration for environmentally friendly reductants is necessary in future research to improve the performance of Fe-BC for Cr(VI) removal by forming more low-valent iron (e.g., Fe0 and Fe2+) and C\u2212O with electron-donating capacity. 3.3.2 Roles of carbon structure in Cr(VI) removal\nIn addition to the SOFGs, the electron transferring and reductive capacity of biochar\ndepends on the condensed polyaromatic carbon matrices that can be readily formed at high pyrolysis temperatures [4, 49]. Therefore, we explored the influences of carbon structure on the Cr(VI) removal and the variations of C/NPC after iron impregnation. All three synthesis methods decreased the carbon content (Fig. S2), which was plausibly expected due to the introduction of iron species on biochar and the adjoint increased O content. However, the changes in the relative proportion of NPC (i.e., the sum of C\u2212C, C=C, and \u03c0-\u03c0* transition carbon) were variable depending on the synthesis methods. The Fe-BC produced by the Preand Post/R- methods was liable to having higher NPC contents than the corresponding pristine BC compared with the Post- method (Fig. 5c). The NPC contents of most Fe-BC were improved in the Pre- method possibly because (i) the presence of iron oxide as active agents contributed to the release of pyrolytic gases (e.g., CO and CO2) via the following reactions (Eq. 4-5), further promoting the formation of well-developed carbon structure [36, 54];\n3Fe2O3 + C \u2192 2Fe3O4 + CO \u2191 (4) 2Fe2O3 + 3C \u2192 4Fe 0 + 3CO2 \u2191 (5)\n(ii) the generated iron carbide or metallic iron during the thermal-reduction process of ironsoaked biomass could catalyze the graphitization of the carbon matrix [50]. In addition, the\nincrease of NPC in Fe-BC synthesized by the Post/R method might be attributed to the use of reductants, while the lower NPC contents were found in all Fe-BC produced by the Postmethod (Fig. 5c).\nAlthough the carbon content of biochar decreased after iron impregnation, the carbon\ncontent was the second influential factor in the Model BP (Fig. 4a). According to the PDP analysis, the carbon contents of BC and Fe-BC ranging from ~65% to ~75% facilitated Cr(VI) removal (Fig. 3c). NPC was identified as the third influential factor in the Model SF (Fig. 4b), further confirming the importance of carbon. The PDP curves of NPC decreased first and then increased with the increasing NPC until the turning point at ~70% (Fig. 6c). The decreasing trend of removal capacity when NPC ranged from ~50% to ~70% could be attributed to the decrease of SOFGs and poorly-developed aromatic structure [51]. In contrast, the enhanced electron transfer capacity of condensed graphitic structures and the improved electron-donating capacity with carbon defects could result in the upturn of removal capacity at high NPC contents (i.e., NPC > 70%) [52, 53]. The carbon structural defects were mainly formed by hightemperature pyrolysis with the formation of graphitized carbon matrices, and they could significantly reduce Cr(VI) to stable Cr(III) [7, 37]. Moreover, well-developed biochar matrices would be more efficient for immobilizing active metal centers and reducing iron leaching, which may be conducive to Cr(VI) removal [7]. Therefore, high carbon contents with rich NPC proportion can also be a choice for the Fe-BC design, which may be attempted with the Pre- or Post/R- methods considering the performance and pros/cons of the three synthesis processes. 3.3.3 Roles of specific surface area in Cr(VI) removal\nThe biochar with a well-developed pore structure is indispensable for removing aqueous\npollutants. The variation of SBET in Fe-BC showed a close correlation to the synthesis methods of Fe-BC. The cases of increase in SBET after iron-impregnation accounted for 77%, 46%, 23% by the Pre-, Post- and Post/R- methods, respectively (Fig. 5d). There were multiple factors influencing SBET variation in Fe-BC. For the Pre- method, the change of SBET in Fe-BC could be attributed to (i) the formation and release of gaseous molecules (such as H2O, CO, and CO2) during the pyrolysis with iron contributed to a highly porous structure with more micropores, leading to the elevated SBET in the Fe-BC [54]; (ii) the iron nanoparticles dispersed in the biochar structure may increase SBET due to the large specific surface area of nanoparticles themselves [55]; and (iii) the possible iron aggregation and surface coverage would decrease SBET, especially at high iron contents [56]. The loaded iron oxides on biochar either formed new surfaces or blocked original pores when using the Post- method, which may result in the nearly fifty-fifty ratio of SBET increase or decrease in Fe-BC compared with pristine BC [57, 58]. The additional reduction step in the Post/R- method would reduce more iron to nano-sized Fe0 grains with the following reaction (Eq. 6), which decreased SBET of Fe-BC possibly because the generated Fe0 nanoparticles were prone to blocking the micropores of biochar [59].\n4Fe3+ + 3BH4 - + 9H2O \u2192 4Fe 0 + 3H2BO3 - + 6H2\u2191 + 12H + (6)\nHowever, the specific BET surface area of BC and Fe-BC was the least influential factor\nfor Cr(VI) removal among the studied material properties (Fig. 4). The minor influence of SBET was reported and attributed to the reduction-dominated and adsorption-aided Cr(VI) removal mechanism [9]. The dependence of the removal capacity on SBET still showed a significant increase, especially when SBET was less than ~100 m 2/g (Fig. 3d), because the larger SBET provided more interaction surface for biochar and Cr(VI). The trend of sustained increase\nbecame trivial with a further rise of SBET because the contents of active sites such as SOFGs and iron species on the biochar surface became the critical factors for improving Cr(VI) removal capacity [19, 60].\nIn general, the indirect impacts of impregnated iron on Cr(VI) removal by altering biochar\nproperties were confirmed using the ML models in this study. The relative importance of these biochar properties for Cr(VI) removal can be ranked as follows: SOFGs > carbon structure > SBET. For each indicator, the optimal proportion to remove Cr(VI) was identified, i.e., O/C (from ~0.24 to ~0.32), C-O (from ~29% to ~38%), C=O (from 0 to ~25%), and NPC (less than 58% or more than 70%). The commonly used three methods for Fe-BC synthesis could promote the increase of O/C, but their influences on the other factors (e.g., C-O/C=O, NPC, SBET) were found to be variable. Therefore, the selection of synthesis methods should be carefully performed considering their influences on the Fe-BC properties, the roles of varying biochar properties in Cr(VI) removal, and the environmental impacts of the biochar synthesis."

            "text": "This study investigated the variations of biochar properties after iron impregnation and\nanalyzed the Cr(VI) removal capacity by BC and Fe-BC using a ML approach. Our results suggested that the direct impact of iron content on Cr(VI) removal capacity by Fe-BC was relatively low, possibly due to undistinguished Fe species in the models, but its indirect impacts were crucial. A higher O/C ratio was found in most Fe-BC after iron impregnation, which was identified as the most critical factor influencing Cr(VI) removal capacity. Based on the detailed information of SOFGs, the relative importance of C\u2212O was higher by 19% than that of C=O\nwith different impact patterns on the removal of Cr(VI), and iron impregnation through postreduction could create a higher ratio of C\u2212O to C=O in the Fe-BC. Furthermore, the carbon contents of BC and Fe-BC ranging from ~65% to ~75% could better facilitate Cr(VI) removal. As the least factor influencing Cr(VI) removal, the specific BET surface area showed that the improvement of Cr(VI) removal would be limited when SBET of BC and Fe-BC was higher than 100 m2/g. The intrinsic information behind these ML models provided a useful reference for the design of engineered biochar under different application scenarios. The ML models can be further improved by distinguishing iron species, non-polar carbon species, and proportion of Cr(VI) reduction and adsorption in future research studies."
