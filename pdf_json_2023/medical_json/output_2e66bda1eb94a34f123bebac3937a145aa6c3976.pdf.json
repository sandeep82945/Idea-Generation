    "abstractText": "Medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaws (MRONJ) is a challenging situation in clinics. Previous studies have shown that pentoxifylline combined with tocopherol proved to be beneficial in patients with osteoradionecrosis, due to their antioxidant and antifibrotic properties. The aim of this randomized study was to evaluate the effect of pentoxifylline and tocopherol in patients that had developed MRONJ after tooth extractions. The study population consisted of 202 Stage I MRONJ female patients with an average age of 66.4 \u00b1 8.3 years, who were divided into two groups. The test group (n = 108) received a pharmacological protocol with pentoxifylline and tocopherol (2 months pre-operatively and 6 months post-operatively). The control group (n = 94) had sequestrectomy operations without any pharmacological preparation. The main outcomes were clinical healing of the mucosa after 1 month, and clinical and radiographic healing of the bone lesion at 6 months. In the test group all patients had mucosal healing and there was only one relapse within 6 months. In the control group, in 17% of the patients the mucosa did not heal, 71% of the patients relapsed within two months, and 7% developed infectious complications (such as abscess or phlegmon). After 6 months, the control group patients with persisting issues were prescribed pentoxifylline and tocopherol, as in the test group. At a subsequent follow-up, all those patients healed completely. Patients were monitored for a period of 7.8 \u00b1 0.3 years, during which no relapse or additional problems were reported. As a conclusion, pentoxifylline and tocopherol protocol seems to be beneficial in the management of MRONJ patients.",

            "text": "Osteonecrosis (avascular necrosis) is caused by an alteration of the physiological bone metabolism during the bone healing process, which may lead to bone death [1,2]. Osteonecrosis of the jaw (ONJ) is a relatively rare but critical condition manifested by necrotic bone lesions localized in the maxilla and/or in the mandible. ONJ has been linked to the use of potent antiresorptive and antiangiogenic agents and has been termed\nJ. Clin. Med. 2023, 12, 4662. https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm12144662 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/jcm\nJ. Clin. Med. 2023, 12, 4662 2 of 14\nmedication related osteonecrosis of the jaw (MRONJ) [3]. Various drugs with different mechanisms of action and effects can potentially trigger MRONJ [4\u20136]. Among these drugs, the most frequently implicated in MRONJ are bisphosphonates (BPs). Currently, BPs are the most famous and major class of drugs for the treatment of bone diseases such as osteoporosis [7]. BPs can specifically block the activity of osteoclasts and therefore bone resorption, with a different mechanism of action and different anti-resorptive efficacy power which is related to their chemical structure [1,8]. The BPs are divided into two large categories, amino-BPs and non-amino-BPs. The former are considered to be more powerful and effective in counteracting bone resorption, as compared to non-amino BPs. However, they are also associated with higher risks of MRONJ [9]. The first early objective sign of an increase in bone density due to the antiresorptive action of BPs is the sclerotization of the alveolar lamina with a reduction in the space of the periodontal ligament that can be targeted by an intraoral radiograph [10]. This increase in density can extend into the context of the entire alveolar process of the maxilla which results in a reduction of the trabecular space with vascular depletion and reduced capillary function, with the attempt to develop new vessels with a diameter slightly less than that of red blood cells. This determines a condition of chronic ischemia and the possibility of avascular necrosis of the bone itself [10\u201313]. Based on this pathogenetic mechanism, to counteract chronic ischemia it is necessary to act on the hemorheological property of the blood flow, the latter largely determined by red blood cells, and to neutralize the oxidative stress due to the rebound effect of the resolution of the same ischemia; there is also a need to enhance the scavenger properties of the affected bone tissue [13\u201315]. Pentoxifylline (PTX) is a methylxanthine derivate that was originally approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat peripheral artery diseases and has been used to treat complications related to fibrosis for over 20 years [16\u201318]. PTX increases vasodilation and erythrocyte flexibility, and reduces blood viscosity which leads to an improvement in peripheral blood flow [17\u201320]. Tocopherols are a class of organic chemical compound consisting of various methylated phenols with beneficial effects. Tocopherols decrease tissue fibrosis and reduce inflammation, and they have antioxidant effects that protect cell membranes from lipid peroxidation by reducing the free radical damage generated during oxidative stress [17,18,21]. Pentoxifylline in combination with tocopherol is described as \u201cPENTO protocol\u201d for the management of osteoradionecrosis with beneficial antioxidant and antifibrotic properties [17]. Currently, these drugs are considered as having a positive synergistic therapeutic efficacy in treating chronic ischemic pathological conditions, such as diabetic microangiopathy, osteoradionecrosis, MRONJ, and osteomyelitis; however, the evidence is still limited and the mechanism of action remains unclear [17,18,21\u201325]. The aim of this randomized clinical study was to evaluate the effect of pentoxifylline and tocopherol in patients that had developed MRONJ after tooth extractions. The main objective was to demonstrate the outcomes of the pharmacological preparation with pentoxifylline and tocopherol in the management of medication-related osteonecrosis of the jaw."

Oncological patients were excluded as the general conditions do not allow waiting 2 months for the pharmacological preparation and the following 6 months for recovery, especially if the bone metastatic disease is progressive and the antiresorptive drug must be applied immediately."

            "text": "The initial population included a total of 697 female osteoporosis patients followed from August 2013 to January 2023. Of these, 377 patients had developed MRONJ following the intake of antiresorptive drugs for longer than 5 years, for disease management. Out of these, 202 patients developed ONJ after tooth extraction and were included in the study. All these patients were under bisphosphonate drug treatments for osteoporotic purposes and were classified as maxillary or mandibular MRONJ Stage I. In more detail, the study population consisted of 202 female patients (108 test, 94 control) with an average age of 66.4 \u00b1 8.3 (SD) years (range 41 to 86 years). There were 21 patients with smoking habits (13 in the test group). All patients were scheduled as MRONJ Stage I and there was no difference in staging of the patients except one patient in control group that developed MRONJ Stage II. All were osteoporosis patients (mean T score \u22123.0 \u00b1 0.4 range \u22122.4 to \u22124.6); there were no patients that were receiving bisphosphonate medications for oncologic reasons.

Regarding the administration route of medications: in the test group at the beginning 93 patients had intra-oral BPs and 15 had intra-muscular BPs; in the control group at the beginning 80 patients had intra-oral BPs and 14 had intra-muscular BPs. All patients taking intra-muscular administration changed the route to intra-oral within one year. Table 1 summarizes the main local features of the patients and the main outcomes of the study. Comparisons between groups were performed using Pearson\u2019s chi square or Fisher\u2019s exact test, as appropriate. Significance is reported in the last column. Healing of the mucosa at one month was observed in all test group patients, while in 17% of subjects in the control group (16 patients) the mucosa did not heal (p < 0.0001). The incidence of relapse of the lesions after initial healing was less than 1% in the test group (1 patient) and it was 71% in the control group (67 patients). All relapses occurred within 6 months. In total, only one failure was observed in the test group and 83 (88%) in the control (p < 0.0001). Smoking habits did not affect either relapse (p = 0.31) or healing (p = 0.77). During the follow-up, seven complications (7.4%) were seen in patients in the control group in addition to failure (three abscesses with cutaneous fistula, two mucous fistula, two phlegmon), while none of the subjects in the test group experienced any complications. In cases of complications, the following treatment was applied: Rocefin (ROCHE SPA) flacon 2 mg intra-vascular (i.v.) (1 flacon in 100 mL of serum physiological) for 7 days, in association with metronidazole 500 mg i.v. (TEOFARMA SRL) (1 flacon every 12 h for 7 days), levoxacin 500 mg i.v. (GLAXOSMITHKLINE SPA) (1 flacon in 100 mL of serum physiological) for 7 days. After 6 months, all the patients of the control group with failures or complications were managed as the patients of the test group with pentoxifylline and tocopherol, at the same dosage. A second surgery was performed when needed. Then, for all the lesions of control patients healing was achieved. All patients were then monitored every six months during the follow-up (mean follow-up period of 7.8 \u00b1 0.3 years, range 7.3 to 8.3 years), during which no patient experienced any relapse or additional problems.\nJ.

Based on this pathogenetic evidence, various therapies have been described in the literature for the management of MRONJ [30\u201333] among which pentoxifylline and tocopherol were reported to have successful outcomes in a very limited number of reports [16,17]. From the analysis of the scientific literature on the management of cases of MRONJ Stage I, in both oncological and non-cancer patients, demolitive surgery represents the first therapeutic choice. This choice involves wide resections, to obtain bleeding bone margins or stumps, a sign of vitality and a necessary condition for the healing process and the absence of recurrences. Very often, to achieve these objectives, the resections become total or sub-total, in the latter case creating structural anatomical conditions where the risk of pathological fracture becomes high. In both cases bone reconstruction procedures are planned, also with microsurgical methods with executions of free flaps (e.g., free flap fibula). The high morbidity of the procedures described above and the considerable biological cost on the part of the patient are immediately obvious. Their high percentage of failure, the impossibility of repetitive procedures, and the notable negative impact on the functions of the entire stomatognathic system have prompted research to associate surgery with adjuvant treatments that can help to overcome the problems described above (such as ozone therapy, hyperbaric therapy with high oxygen rates, surgery with the Nd-YAG Laser, the aid of the VELscope\u00a9 to predictably define the border between vital and necrotic bone, and the application of blood derivatives and components) [34\u201337]. All these options share the goal of avoiding or reducing the extent of surgical demolition, supporting the healing process, and reducing recurrence rates. However, the analysis of the scientific literature on the use of these methods does not clearly and unequivocally define the real adjuvant impact in the management of MRONJ among them [34\u201337]. Very often it has proved useless and not very effective due to the high rate of oxygen free radicals which caused considerable damage to the vital residual bone component, producing the paradoxical effect of increasing necrosis itself. Laser surgery, apart from a minor impact on procedural morbidity, has no contrasting effect on the etiopathogenesis of ONJ; the same applies to surgery with the aid of the VELscope\u00a9 [34]. Furthermore, many studies, while showing promising results, are conditioned by the small number of patients treated, not allowing a robust statistical analysis with impact to facilitate and develop guidelines. This problem also afflicts the studies that have proposed pentoxifylline and tocopherol as an adjuvant method in the surgical management of MRONJ [37\u201340]. This study reports an adjuvant method to the surgical management of MRONJ Stage I with an objective to affect the progress of the disease by improving blood circulation, by making the surgery as minimally invasive as possible and avoiding excessively destructive procedures. Consequently, the quality of life of patients can improve. The application of the pharmacological preparation protocol before surgery, using pentoxifylline and tocopherol, aims to counteract the chronic ischemic condition and overcome the oxidative stress associated with the rebound effect by improving blood circulation. The goal is to create ideal bone microenvironmental conditions for the healing process. This increase in blood flow can bring the entire inflammatory and immune cellular compartment at the infected site, by isolating the necrotic bone tissue from the vital and reactive bone tissue. As a result, this granulation tissue will create a cleavage plane, which makes the sequestrectomy operation less aggressive than the past. Due to the blood circulation, enhanced by the pharmacological protocol, both mucosal and bone healing were achieved predictably. Lastly, the absence of relapse in the test group during the follow-up can be justified by the accelerated healing. In the control group, the recurrence rate was higher than the test group. This unhealed chronic ischemic clinical condition at the affected site might occur because of the oxidative stress, the lack of inflammatory and immune reactive capacity of the bone, and poor blood circulation. Furthermore, sequestrectomy surgery itself is a destructive operation and can constitute a new trigger for the development of osteonecrosis as it aggravates the ischemic condition to the neighboring tissues.\nJ. Clin. Med. 2023, 12, 4662 12 of 14\nAccording to the results of this study, patients in the test group experienced no relapse and no complications during six months after surgery. On the other hand, in the control group, 71% of the patients relapsed immediately or within two months, and the remainder did not heal, or developed infectious complications such as the abscess or phlegmon type. After 6 months, the patients in the control group received the same pharmacological protocol as the patients in the test group; consequently, MRONJ lesions completely resolved clinically, without experiencing any relapse or additional problems in the follow-up. The importance of this study is that the pre-operative pharmacological preparation that is used acts by actively counteracting the etiological factors which are at the pathogenetic basis of osteonecrosis. Pentoxifylline counteracts the chronic ischemic condition which underlies the development of osteonecrotic tissue, allowing the suffering bone to completely recover back to its vitality and to sequester the necrotic bone simultaneously. Additional tocopherol eliminates the toxic aspects of oxygen free radicals due to the rebound effect of the restoration of an adequate blood flow of the bone. Furthermore, its use creates microenvironmental conditions for the adequate development of new blood vessels, for local stimulus effect on angiogenesis. In the literature, there are very limited reports on pentoxifylline and tocopherol combinations as adjunctive therapy in the management of osteonecrotic tissues, especially in cases of MRONJ [17,37\u201340]. This clinical research on 202 MRONJ patients can contribute to the literature due to the relatively large number of subjects and long follow-up period of around 8 years. However, it also has some limitations. One of the limitations of this work is that no oncologic patients were included, and it would be interesting to evaluate and compare their findings with osteoporotic patients. Furthermore, all the patients had osteonecrosis with Stage I, excluding patients with more advanced stages. In Stage I patients only the alveolar process of the maxilla and mandible is affected, while in Stage II, in addition to the presence of infection and inflammation, the necrotic process extends beyond the alveolar process to the basal bone of the jaws. This would imply a variation of the surgical procedure in which not only a demolitive but also a reconstructive approach would be required. Therefore, the surgical results would have been difficult to interpret, due to the introduction of further variables. In osteoporotic patients, Stage II is much less frequent than Stage I, because the early diagnosis of the problem is faster, and usually the general conditions of the patient are better than in cancer patients. In fact, in the latter, since the general conditions are poorer, the doses of antiresorptives are higher, and the route of administration is different (usually intravenous), the MRONJ onset is already in advanced stages. Additionally, the residual presence of bisphosphonate should be investigated by comparing the chemical composition of the sequestrated osteonecrotic bone before and after drug preparation in a subsequent study. Obviously, these limitations represent new research objectives for future studies and this report should be considered as preliminary research on this topic, as it represents a first step towards the goal of developing a valid non-aggressive protocol for the management of MRONJ patients."
