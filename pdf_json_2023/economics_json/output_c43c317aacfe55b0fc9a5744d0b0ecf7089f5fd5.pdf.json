This view has undoubtedly gained significant traction since the housing boom that preceded the 2008 crisis, and even more so since the Covid-19 crisis.1 The proponents of this view accordingly worry that these bubbles may burst as inflation picks up and monetary policy tightens, thereby generating severe financial instability.2\nThis narrative is commonly dismissed by economists and policy makers as not grounded in theory. To be sure, a sizeable literature studies the interplay of monetary policy and bubbles.3\n\u2217Sciences Po, 28 rue des Saints-Peres, 75007 Paris, France (guillaume.plantin@sciencespo.fr). This paper supersedes an earlier one entitled \u201cBubbles against Financial Repression\u201d.\n1Examples abound, for example, in the blogosphere: \u201cPandemic-Era Central Banking Is Creating Bubbles Everywhere\u201d (https://www.bloomberg.com), \u201cThe Fed Has Created A Monster Bubble It Can No Longer Control\u201d (https://seekingalpha.com), \u201cThe Fed Is Creating A Monster Bubble\u201d (https://www.forbes.com/), \u201cFed Trying To Inflate A 4th Bubble To Fix The Third\u201d (https://seekingalpha.com),\u201cThe Fed\u2019s Corporate Bond Buying Is Stoking Bubble Fears\u201d (https://www.cnbc.com),...\n2See, e.g., \u201cStock Market Bubble Will Burst And Inflation Will Follow\u201d, \u201cWill Higher Inflation End U.S. Asset Bubbles?\u201d (https://www.forbes.com).\n3Following Bernanke and Gertler (2001), contributions include Gali (2014), Ikeda and Phan (2016), Allen et al. (2018), Dong et al. (2020), and Asriyan et al. (2021).\n1\nBubbles in this literature are not a monetary phenomenon, however. They arise because the natural interest rate\u2014the one that would prevail in the presence of flexible prices\u2014is sufficiently low to make bubbles sustainable. This literature then studies how monetary policy should be modified to take these \u201cnatural\u201d bubbles into account.\nBy contrast, this paper introduces bubbles as a pure monetary phenomenon. Such \u201cmonetary\u201d bubbles are the unintended consequence of monetary policy in an economy in which bubbles would be impossible were prices flexible and monetary policy deprived of real effects. Beyond fitting a widespread narrative, monetary bubbles have three important features that distinguish them from natural ones:\n1. Monetary bubbles do not lift interest rates nor asset returns. Natural bubbles push the interest rate up, the more so the larger they are. By contrast, the interest rate remains low in the presence of monetary bubbles no matter their size. In particular, monetary bubbles themselves earn a low expected return.\n2. Monetary bubbles and large CPI inflation are mutually exclusive. Natural bubbles and CPI inflation can have any arbitrary joint dynamics in our setup. By contrast, monetary bubbles and CPI inflation are mutually exclusive and cannot jointly occur in equilibrium. As an example, we construct a sunspot equilibrium in which monetary bubbles burst when inflation (stochastically) picks up.\n3. Monetary bubbles always crowd investment out. Whereas natural bubbles may (or may not) crowd investment in by alleviating financial constraints, monetary bubbles are always substitutes to investment.\nGiven these properties, monetary bubbles offer a natural rationalization of the common narrative that low policy rates may backfire into \u201cbad\u201d bubbles. Their low return and negative impact on investment, which are two sides of the same coin, fit well in an environment in which business investment has yet remained subdued despite low rates and compressed risk and liquidity premia. Their incompability with CPI inflation and with resulting higher policy rates also resonates with current concerns about market crashes following bouts of inflation.\nWe seek to write down the simplest model in which such monetary bubbles may arise. We import two standard New Keynesian ingredients, imperfectly competitive price setters and the conduct of monetary policy via an interest-rate rule, in an economy plagued by three frictions\u2014 market incompleteness, a financial friction, and a monetary friction. Each of these frictions plays the following role.\nMarket incompleteness. Market incompleteness in the form of overlapping generations opens up the possibility of equilibria with rational bubbles.\n2\nFinancial friction. Proceeds from investments cannot be entirely pledged to outside financiers. Such limited pledgeability implies that natural bubbles may crowd investment in as they alleviate financial constraints.\nMonetary friction. Firms must incur a fixed menu cost if they seek to update their prices. As in the seminal paper of Ball and Romer (1991), menu costs open up the possibility of multiple equilibria with varying levels of price rigidity. Such multiplicity occurs when, as is the case in our economy, the gain to an individual firm from updating its price over the statu quo is larger when other firms update their prices than when they stick to the statu quo (strategic complementarity in price setting).\nOur main insights are best described by comparing equilibria with different levels of price rigidity. First, there exists a flexible-price equilibrium in which all firms find it optimal to incur the menu cost at each date and adjust their prices. Monetary policy perfectly pins down inflation in this case and has no real effects. The real rate of the economy is its natural rate, and thus there may be bubbles if and only if this natural rate is sufficiently small. As is standard, such natural bubbles when feasible lift the interest rate. Their impact on investment is ambiguous due to the financial friction. They might crowd investment in if the higher interest rate improves the net worth of financially constrained agents, as, e.g., in Farhi and Tirole (2012a) or Martin and Ventura (2012).4\nThere also exists a rigid-price equilibrium because firms find updating their individual prices too costly when the overall price level is constant, making fixed prices a self-justified phenomenon. The logic of the interest-rate feedback rule then implies that the policy rate, which is also the real rate given price rigidity, is below the natural rate. Thus there can be rational bubbles, deemed monetary bubbles, in the rigid-price equilibrium even though the natural rate is too large for natural bubbles to arise in the flexible-price equilibrium. Absence of arbitrage implies that these monetary bubbles earn the policy rate no matter their size. Since monetary bubbles unlike natural ones do not affect the interest rate, something else has to give in equilibrium so that they can squeeze in. We show that monetary bubbles drain resources from financially constrained agents with investment opportunities, thereby eroding their net wealth, towards savers so that the latter can purchase the bubbles. Monetary bubbles are thus always detrimental to investment in a model in which natural ones, when they are feasible, may by contrast be beneficial.\nIn sum, we show that a standard monetary friction, a menu cost, can create endogenous instability both in goods markets by inducing endogenous changes in price flexibility, and in capital markets by unlocking the possibility of bubbles even (but not only) when a high natural rate precludes them. There are many equilibria in our economy as multiplicity in goods markets compounds with that in assets markets. All the equilibria with monetary bubbles however share important features:\n4As is well-known, this contrasts with rational bubbles in a frictionless environment that always crowd out investment.\n3\ni) the same low real interest rate; ii) the same below-target CPI inflation; iii) the same subdued investment expenditures.\nIn order to give a more concrete illustration of this endogenous instability of goods and assets prices, we construct a particular sunspot equilibrium in which the economy stochastically switches from a rigid-price regime to a flexible-price one. The economy starts out with fixed prices. The interest rate is low. A stochastic monetary bubble grows that diverts savings from investment. At a stopping time at which firms coordinate on adjusting their prices, the bubble bursts, inflation picks up, and both nominal and real rates increase. This occurs in an economy that faces no fundamental uncertainty nor uncertainty regarding the conduct of monetary policy.\nRelated Literature\nA large and growing literature explores the empirical plausibility of menu costs as a significant source of price rigidity. Reviewing it is beyond the scope of this paper. Yet, the insight pioneered by Ball and Romer (1991) that menu costs may generate multiple equilibria has been much less explored. This paper is to my knowledge the first to stress that such multiplicity may go beyond inflation dynamics and pave the way to asset bubbles as a monetary phenomenon.\nIt is important to highlight that this fixed menu cost is the only source of equilibrium multiplicity that we focus on. In particular, the resulting multiplicity in inflation dynamics is unrelated to that possibly generated by interest-feedback rules (Benhabib et al., 2001a,b, 2002a,b). It would actually still prevail under any other modeling of monetary policy.5 The Taylor rule here only has the implication that given a positive inflation target, the policy rate is lower than the natural rate when the economy is in the rigid-price equilibrium. This unlocks the possibility of monetary bubbles even when the natural rate is large.\nThis paper also contributes to the literature that studies the effect of bubbles on investment, in particular in the presence of financial constraints (Caballero et al., 2006; Farhi and Tirole, 2012a; Martin and Ventura, 2012; Hirano and Yanagawa, 2016). Closest to our setup is the model of \u201cbubbly liquidity\u201d by Farhi and Tirole (2012a). We introduce simple New Keynesian ingredients in a related environment. A modelling difference is that entrepreneurs\u2019 endowment is endogenous here.\nThis paper also has connections to the literature that studies interest-rate policies as a tool to mitigate financial-market imperfections (Benmelech and Bergman, 2012; Caballero and Simsek, 2020; Diamond and Rajan, 2012; Farhi and Tirole, 2012b). This literature has emphasized how subsidizing the interest rate and financial repression may backfire into various forms of exces-\n5Ball and Romer (1991) for example obtain this multiplicity in their original paper in which monetary policy consists in controlling money supply in the presence of a cash-in-advance constraint.\n4\nsive risk taking. To our knowledge, we are the first to show that such excessive risk taking may materialize into \u201cbad\u201d rational bubbles.\nFinally, it is interesting to relate this paper to the intermediary asset pricing literature pioneered by He and Krishnamurthy (2012, 2013). In this literature, negative shocks to sophisticated investors\u2019 wealth negatively affects all asset prices. The very distinct impacts of natural and monetary bubbles on entrepreneurs\u2019 net worth is also the main driver of their respective properties here.\nThe paper is organized as follows. Section I sets up the model. Sections II, III, and IV respectively study the flexible-price, fixed-price, and general versions of it, and Section V concludes."

We will take P\u22121 > 0 as exogenously given.\nFrictions. The economy is plagued by two frictions, a financial one and a monetary one.\nAssumption 1. (Financial friction: Limited pledgeability) An entrepreneur can divert all or part of the proceeds from her investment and consume a fraction 1\u2212 \u03bb of the diverted proceeds, where \u03bb \u2208 (0, 1).\nThis financial friction will induce credit rationing that may give rise to bubbles under some circumstances despite dynamic efficiency (\u03c1 > 1). The second friction is a nominal rigidity such that monetary policy may have real effects:\nAssumption 2. (Monetary friction: Menu cost) Young date-t entrepreneur i \u2208 [0, 1] must incur a fixed cost equal to F units of labor, where F \u2265 0, in order to change the price of intermediate good i from the statu quo P it\u22121 to a new value.\nThe usual broad interpretation of the menu cost F is that it stands for the costs of information collection and decision making incurred by an entrepreneur unwilling to stick to the statu quo.6 We posit to fix ideas that P i\u22121 = P\u22121 for all i \u2208 [0, 1].\nFinally, we impose the parameter restriction\nu\u2032 ( \u03b12\u03b2\u03c1\n\u03b3\n) \u2264 \u03b2\u03c1,(4)\nand will explain its role in due course.\n6See Alvarez et al. (2011) for an explicit modelling of costly information collection and menu costs in a pricesetting problem.\n6\nDiscussion. Two comments are in order. First, overlapping generations are only a simple way to generate the incompleteness that allows for rational bubbles. Less stylized (and less tractable) alternatives would of course be available (Aiyagari, 1994; Bewley, 1986; Woodford, 1990, e.g.). As in Martin and Ventura (2012) or Farhi and Tirole (2012a), the concept of generation in this setup should not be interpreted literally: Time elapsing between two dates is much shorter than 75 years. Assuming the same short-lived agents with simple preferences as in these papers enables us to introduce in the simplest fashion our novel insights on the joint instability of goods and assets markets. A particular gain from such simple preferences is that they enable us to solve for the equilibrium without resorting to log-linearization nor any other approximation. This will be important for the analysis in the presence of multiple equilibria in Section IV.\nSecond, as in the seminal paper of Ball and Romer (1991), we rely on a simple fixed menu cost to generate multiple equilibria with varying price rigidity. We could alternatively borrow from the literature that generates such multiplicity out of informational frictions (Amador and Weill, 2010; Gaballo, 2017, e.g.). We leave this exciting route for future research."

The same two forces as in Farhi and Tirole (2012a) are at play in shaping entrepreneurs\u2019 investment capacity I(r). This capacity is driven both by their net worth \u03b4r and by the leverage ratio r/(r \u2212 \u03bb\u03c1) that applies to it. As r increases, so does their net worth since this spurs labor supply and thus entrepreneurs\u2019 profits.11 This also negatively affects their leverage ratio as they can finance with external funds\n10Appendix A.1 details the solution to this standard optimal-contracting problem. 11In Farhi and Tirole (2012a), entrepreneurs\u2019 net worth increases with respect to the interest rate because they must store an exogenous endowment at this rate before investing. Their endowment endogenously increases with respect to r here.\n9\na fraction at most equal to \u03bb\u03c1/r, decreasing in r, of the proceeds from investment. If \u03bb \u2265 0.5, the negative leverage effect always more than offsets the net worth effect. If entrepreneurs are more constrained (\u03bb < 0.5), the positive net-worth effect dominates for sufficiently high rates, that is, when r \u2208 [2\u03bb\u03c1, \u03c1]. The reason is that the marginal positive effect of an increasing rate on entrepreneurs\u2019 net worth is constant, whereas the marginal negative effect on leverage decreases with respect to r, and so the former may prevail for a sufficiently large rate.\nSavings equal investment in equilibrium. The three dashed lines in Figure 1 illustrate three possibilities for the graph of aggregate savings S(r) depending on parameter values. In any case, market clearing pins down a unique equilibrium (r, I). It may be such that r \u2264 \u03c1 and I = I(r) given by (15), or such that r > \u03c1 and I = 0. In this latter case entrepreneurs find loans to households preferable to investment. There is also an intermediate situation in which r = \u03c1 and entrepreneurs\u2019 incentive-compatibility constraint is slack (I < I(r)). The following proposition collects these results and offers a simple comparative statics property.\nProposition 1. (Non-bubbly flexible-price equilibrium) There exists a unique non-bubbly equilibrium with perfect foresight. If r < \u03c1, investment is constrained: (14) is binding. If r > \u03c1, entrepreneurs lend to households rather than invest. It may also be that r = \u03c1 and (14) is slack.\nOutput \u03b1L = \u03b4!r, interest rate r, and investment I increase with respect to \u03bb other things being equal.\nProof. See Appendix A.1.\nAs the pledgeability \u03bb of entrepreneurs\u2019 ventures decreases, this reduces their ability to lever up their net wealth, which both reduces their investment capacity and raises the price of storage vehicles (depresses the interest rate) as the supply of such vehicles by entrepreneurs shrinks. Lower returns on savings in turn reduce life-long returns from supplying labor which depresses output."

Provided \u03c1\u03bb < 1, other parameters can clearly be such that this is the case. It is worthwhile stressing that, as in Farhi and Tirole (2012a), the economy is always dynamically efficient as the overall return on assets is \u03c1 > 1. The low return on external funds induced by financial frictions may create space for bubbles, though.\nWe focus here on the \u201cbubbly steady state\u201d: the (unique) situation in which a constant-size\n10\nbubble is refinanced at a unit interest rate.12 This bubbly steady state suffices to illustrate the properties of bubbles in the flexible-price model that we want to contrast with that of the \u201cmonetary bubbles\u201d introduced later in Section III.\nSince \u03c1 > 1, the non-bubbly perfect-foresight equilibrium, if it is such that r < 1, must also be such that investment is given by entrepreneurs\u2019 binding financial constraint:\nI(r) = \u03b4r2\nr \u2212 \u03bb\u03c1 = \u03b4!r \u2212 \u03c6(\u03b2r),(16)\nand so the bubbly steady state features a bubble with size B that solves\n\u03b4\n1\u2212 \u03bb\u03c1 = \u03b4!\u2212 \u03c6(\u03b2)\u2212 B.(17)\nCondition (17) states that investment equals savings net of investment in a bubble B at the equilibrium unit interest rate.13 The right-hand panel in Figure 2 shows bubble size B as the wedge between savings and investment at r = 1.\nThe remainder of the paper deems \u201cnatural\u201d these bubbles that arise because the natural interest rate r is smaller than one, as opposed to the purely monetary bubbles studied in Section III that will grow (and burst) despite higher natural rates.\nOutput is unambiguously higher in the bubbly steady state than in the non-bubbly equilibrium as it increases to \u03b4! from \u03b4!r. Both capital and labor share increase as well since their relative contributions to output remain constant. Comparing investment at bubbly and non-bubbly steady states, Figure 2 shows that the rise of a bubble always crowds investment out when \u03bb \u2265 0.5 but crowds it in if \u03bb < 0.5 and r is sufficiently large.14 The intuition is simply that the raise in interest rate caused by the bubble has a negative impact on entrepreneurs\u2019 leverage ratio that may or may not offset the increase in their own resources.\n12There are of course a plethora of bubbly dynamics whereby an initial bubble keeps shrinking as it is refinanced at interest rates strictly smaller than one. Also, bubbles may burst stochastically and new bubbles may stochastically arise at each date.\n13To fix ideas, we suppose that the bubble is initialy issued by old households at date 0. 14The left-hand panel in Figure 2 illustrates crowding out when the non-bubbly steady state is at E and crowding in\nwhen it is at E\u2032.\n11\nProposition 2. (Natural bubbles and investment) The bubbly steady state exists if and only if the non-bubbly equilibrium is such that r < 1. Output is higher under the bubbly steady state than under the non-bubbly equilibrium. So is investment if and only if 2\u03bb\u03c1 < 1 and r \u2265 rI , where rI < 1 solves I(rI) = I(1).\nHouseholds\u2019 utility is higher in the bubbly steady-state than in the non-bubbly equilibrium whereas that of entrepreneurs may or may not be higher.\nProof. See Appendix A.2.\nSince output is larger in the presence of a bubble and the proceeds from investment are indeterminate, the effect of the bubble on total income per period (the sum of the two) is also ambiguous. It is easy to show that anything can go. In any case, given the purpose of the paper, the important result in this section is that natural bubbles can be either good or bad for investment and for entrepreneurs\u2019 welfare. We now show that bubbles as a pure monetary phenomenon are by contrast always detrimental to investment and entrepreneurs."

This sharp characterization of the real effects of monetary policy will turn useful when analyzing monetary bubbles. The following proposition summarizes these insights. Define\nr \u2261 max { \u03bb\u03c1; inf { x | \u03b1 2\u03b2x\n\u03b3 \u2265 \u03c6(\u03b2x)\n}} .(27)\nNotice that r does not depend on !, and that (4) implies that the inequality in (27) is satisfied at \u03c1.\nProposition 3.

There exists a decreasing oneto-one mapping \u03b7() between (r, \u03c1) and (\u03b7(\u03c1),+\u221e) such that the real block of this equilibrium is identical to that of the non-bubbly flexible-price equilibrium of an economy with elasticity of substitution \u03b7(r\u0302) and otherwise identical parameters (\u03b1, \u03c1,\u03bb, \u03b2, \u03b3,\u03c6(.)).\nProof. See Appendix A.3.\nAgain, Proposition 3 states that the selection of a nominal interest rate in the fixed-price case is identical to that of an elasticity of substitution in the flexible-price case as far as the real block of the model is concerned. Output and investment have relatively simple expressions in this non-bubbly equilibrium.\nCorollary 4. (Output and investment in the non-bubbly case) In this fixed-price equilibrium, output \u03b1L and investment I are the following functions of r\u0302:\n\u03b1L = \u03b12\u03b2\u03c1\u03bb\n2\u03b3\n( 1 + \u221a 1 + 4\u03b3\u03c6(\u03b2r\u0302)(r\u0302 \u2212 \u03c1\u03bb)\n\u03b12\u03b22\u03c12\u03bb2\n) ,(28)\nI = \u03b1L\u2212 \u03c6(\u03b2r\u0302).(29)\nTwo values r < r\u0302 < r\u0302\u2032 < \u03c1 may lead to the same output.

See Appendix A.4.\nAn inflation target \u03a0\u2217 strictly larger than 1 implies that the real rate r\u0302 is smaller than the natural rate r: The interest-feedback rule dictates monetary easing when inflation is below target. It is transparent from the expressions in Corollary 4 that if u is sufficiently close to linear (-\u03c6\u2032 large), then output and investment decrease with respect to the interest rate over [r\u0302, r]. Thus, the monetary easing induced by below-target inflation spurs investment and output in this case."

This of course can always be the case as soon as r < 1 regardless of the value of the natural rate r. One only needs (\u03a0\u2217)\u03c8 to be sufficiently large other things being equal. The following proposition highlights two distinctive properties of such monetary bubbles relative to natural ones.\nProposition 5. (Monetary bubbles are always bad for investment and entrepreneurs) There exist fixed-price equilibria with bubbles if r < r\u0302 < 1. In such equilibria, bubbles earn an expected return r\u0302. Output and households\u2019 utility are higher than in the non-bubbly equilibrium, whereas investment and entrepreneurs\u2019 utility are lower.\nProof. See Appendix A.5.\nThere are two major differences between the natural bubbles that arise in the flexible-price case and these monetary bubbles when prices are fixed:\n1. Natural bubbles raise the interest rate whereas monetary bubbles do not affect it since the monetary authority controls it. Monetary bubbles thus earn low returns themselves.\n2. Whereas natural bubbles may be either substitute or complement to investment, and either good or bad for entrepreneurs (Proposition 2), a monetary bubble always crowds out investment and reduces entrepreneurs\u2019 utility.\nIn the current environment of low real rates and subdued business investment, monetary bubbles therefore seem to be of a more plausible nature than natural ones. These two features of monetary bubbles are two sides of the same coin that can be explained as follows. A useful way to compare natural and monetary bubbles consist in studying their respective impacts on prices and quantities in the capital market. Consider first natural bubbles. Equilibrium in the capital market in the flexible-price non-bubbly equilibrium implies:\n15\n\u03b4(!)r2\nr \u2212 \u03bb\u03c1 = \u03b4(!)!r \u2212 \u03c6(\u03b2r),(30)\nwhere \u03b4(x) = \u03b12\u03b2(x\u2212 1)/(x2\u03b3) is decreasing over [2,+\u221e) whereas x\u03b4(x) is increasing, and r is the natural rate. The left-hand side of (30) is entrepreneurs\u2019 investment and the right-hand one is aggregate savings. The presence of a natural bubble b leaves ! of course unchanged but affects the equilibrium interest rate, which jumps to a value r\u2032 > r such that17\n\u03b4(!)r\u20322\nr\u2032 \u2212 \u03bb\u03c1 = \u03b4(!)!r \u2032 \u2212 \u03c6(\u03b2r\u2032)\u2212 b.(31)\nOutput, total savings, and entrepreneurs\u2019 savings all increase in the presence of a bubble. As seen in Section II, investment may or may not increase depending on whether the leverage effect more than offsets this.\nConsider then monetary bubbles. Equilibrium in the capital market in the fixed-price nonbubbly equilibrium implies:\n\u03b4(\u03b7(r\u0302))(r\u0302)2\nr\u0302 \u2212 \u03bb\u03c1 = \u03b4(\u03b7(r\u0302))\u03b7(r\u0302)r\u0302 \u2212 \u03c6(\u03b2r\u0302).(32)\nUnlike in the flexible-price case, the presence of a bubble b now leaves the interest rate r\u0302 unchanged. Conversely, the \u201cshadow\u201d elasticity of substitution \u03b7(r\u0302) is replaced by a new elasticity of substitution \u03b7b such that the capital-market clears\n\u03b4(\u03b7b)r\u03022\nr\u0302 \u2212 \u03bb\u03c1 = \u03b4(\u03b7 b)!br\u0302 \u2212 \u03c6(\u03b2r\u0302)\u2212 b.(33)\nIt must be that \u03b7b > \u03b7(r\u0302).18 The proof of Proposition 5 shows that this entails in turn that output and the labor share increase with a bubble b > 0, whereas the capital share and investment must be lower in the presence of the bubble than in its absence. Intuitively, it is possible to squeeze bubbles on top of investment projects only if households overall have more investable funds. This must come at a reduction in the capital share relative to the non-bubbly equilibrium (\u03b7b > \u03b7(r\u0302)) which always negatively affects investment because it reduces entrepreneurs\u2019 net wealth.\nIn sum, a compact way of stating the difference between natural and monetary bubbles is that the former affect r whereas the latter affect !, and this shapes their respective impacts on the economy.\n17r\u2032 was equal to 1 in Section II that studied the bubbly steady state. 18This stems from the LHS of (33) being decreasing in \u03b7 and the RHS increasing.\n16"

            "text": "Recall that the parameters that determine the real block of the flexible-price model studied in Section II are (!,\u03b1, \u03c1,\u03bb, \u03b2, \u03b3,\u03c6(.)), whereas the ones that shape the fixed-price equilibrium are (\u03b1, \u03c1,\u03bb, \u03b2, \u03b3,\u03c6(.), r\u0302), where r\u0302 = r/(\u03a0\u2217)\u03c8. For brevity, we assume for the remainder of the paper that these parameters are such that:\nr < r\u0302 < 1 < r < \u03c1.(34)\nThis restricts the analysis to situations in which: i) the flexible-price equilibrium (Proposition 1) is such that entrepreneurs are financially constrained; ii) there are no equilibria with natural bubbles; iii) there exists a fixed-price equilibrium as in Proposition 3; iv) there exists fixed-price equilibria with monetary bubbles. We also suppose that output (28) and investment (29) decrease with respect to the interest rate over the range [r\u0302, r], so that output and investment are larger in the fixed-price (non-bubbly) equilibrium than in the flexible-price one other parameters than F being equal. Finally, we assume for simplicity that the menu cost F corresponds to a non-pecuniary disutility for entrepreneurs and thus does not reduce their resources when sunk.19\nTo be sure, the restriction to r > 1 is only meant to sharpen our results by exhibiting bubbles in an economy in which the natural rate precludes them. All the results in this section carry over in the case r \u2264 1 corresponding to economies such that \u201cr < g\u201d. The only difference is that equilibria with natural bubbles would be sustainable as well.\nProposition 6. (Multiple equilibrium levels of price rigidity) Holding all parameters (!,\u03b1, \u03c1,\u03bb, \u03b2, \u03b3,\u03c6(.), r\u0302) fixed, there exists \u03a0\u2217, \u03c8 and 0 < F < F\u0304 such that if F \u2208 [F , F\u0304 ], both the non-bubbly flexible-price equilibrium in Proposition 1 and the non-bubbly fixed-price equilibrium in Proposition 3 can be sustained. There also exist equilibria with monetary bubbles.\nProof. We let Y F and wF denote the respective output and real wage in the flexible-price equilibrium described in Proposition 1, and Y R and wR their counterparts in the rigid-price equilibrium in\n19This implies that the equilibrium when F = 0 (Section II) can be readily used when prices are flexible without adjusting entrepreneurs\u2019 resources for sunk menu costs.\n17\nProposition 3. The fixed-price equilibrium can be sustained if entrepreneur i \u2208 [0, 1] born at date t finds it preferable to leave the price of good i unchanged at P it\u22121 = P\u22121 and save F to optimal pricing when other agents behave as described in Proposition 3. Formally, it must be that\nmax P i\n{ Y R ( P\u22121 P i )\" ( P i \u2212 W R \u03b1 )} \u2212 FWR \u2264 Y R ( P\u22121 \u2212 WR \u03b1 ) ,(35)\nwhich can be rewritten after optimizing over P i\nF \u2265 ( \u03b1(!\u2212 1)\nY R\n)\"\u22121 ( Y R\nwR!\n)\" + Y R ( 1\n\u03b1 \u2212 1 wR\n) .(36)\nSimilarly, the flexible-price equilibrium can be sustained if entrepreneur i \u2208 [0, 1] born at date t finds it preferable to optimize the price of the intermediate good P it rather than leave it unchanged at P it\u22121 and save F when other agents behave as described in Proposition 1:\nmax P i\n{ Y F ( Pt P i )\" ( P i \u2212 W F t \u03b1 )} \u2212 FW Ft \u2265 Y F ( Pt P it\u22121 )\" ( P it\u22121 \u2212 W Ft \u03b1 )+ ,(37)\nwhich can be rewritten after optimizing over P i\nF \u2264 ( \u03b1(!\u2212 1)\nY F\n)\"\u22121 ( Y F\nwF !\n)\" \u2212 Y F (\u03a0\u2217)\"\u22121 ( 1\nwF \u2212 \u03a0\n\u2217\n\u03b1\n)+ .(38)\nFrom (36) and (38), the set of menu costs for which both equilibria coexist is an interval with nonempty interior if and only if\n( \u03b1(!\u2212 1)\nY R\n)\"\u22121 ( Y R\nwR!\n)\" + Y R ( 1\n\u03b1 \u2212 1 wR\n) < ( \u03b1(!\u2212 1)\nY F\n)\"\u22121 ( Y F\nwF !\n)\" (39)\n\u2212Y F (\u03a0\u2217)\"\u22121 ( 1\nwF \u2212 \u03a0\n\u2217\n\u03b1\n)+ .\nBy assumption monetary easing expands output: Y R > Y F . Furthermore, equations (19) and (20) together with Y = \u03b1L imply that Y R/wR = Y F/[wF (\u03a0\u2217)\u03a8] < Y F/wF . Together with wR \u2264 \u03b1, this implies that (39) holds as soon as the second term on the RHS is sufficiently large, that is, given that wF = \u03b1(!\u22121)/!, if \u03a0\u2217 is not too small relative to !/!\u22121. Economically, this restriction ensures that an entrepreneur has incentives to change its price in the flexible-price regime because the increase in the nominal wage reduces too much its margin otherwise.\nNotice that this restriction on \u03a0\u2217 is feasible holding parameters (!,\u03b1, \u03c1,\u03bb, \u03b2, \u03b3,\u03c6(.), r\u0302) fixed because \u03c8 can be chosen so that r\u0302 is fixed given r and \u03a0\u2217. This restriction on \u03a0\u2217 is only a rather strong sufficient condition ensuring that (39) holds. Whether (39) actually holds without it, at least\n18\nfor some range of parameters, is an open question that we have not been able to tackle analytically, and that is of limited interest given the qualitative nature of the analysis.\nMonetary bubbles. If (39) holds for the non-bubbly fixed-price equilibrium it therefore also holds for sufficiently small monetary bubbles as the right-hand side is unchanged whereas the left-hand side can be made arbitrarily close to its value in the non-bubbly case.\nProposition 6 states that other real parameters being equal, there exists a range of values for the menu cost F such that both flexible-price and rigid-price equilibria can be sustained. Such a range of menu costs can exist if and only if each entrepreneur finds it more valuable to adjust its price when fellow entrepreneurs do so (in the flexible-price equilibrium) than when they do not (in the rigid-price equilibrium), or, when its differential gain from optimal pricing over the statu quo is larger when other firms price optimally. The essential economic force ensuring that this is the case is the fact that when prices are rigid and the real rate is thus low, the capital share is smaller than when they are flexible. This more than offsets the fact that output is overall larger when prices a rigid. This makes the potential gains from changing its price smaller to an entrepreneur in a rigid-price environment than to an entrepreneur in a flexible-price one.\nThis economy has a plethora of equilibria because it compounds multiplicity in goods and assets markets. If agents coordinate on rigid prices for goods, this unlocks the possibility of monetary bubbles via a low interest rate. All equilibria share the common property, though, that CPI inflation and asset bubbles do not jointly occur."

            "text": "More generally, this multiplicity of equilibria epitomizes instability in both goods and asset markets when prices are strategic complements. This last section offers a more concrete illustration of this instability. We construct a particular sunspot equilibrium that comprises two phases. During the first phase, prices are rigid and a stochastic monetary bubble grows. At the random date at which this phase ends, the bubbles bursts, the economy reverts back to the flexible-price equilibrium, and sticks to it forever. Inflation picks up and both real and nominal interest rates increase.\nFormally, we suppose in this section that the conditions stated in Proposition 6 hold. Let p \u2208 (0, 1) such that20\nr < ( p+\n1\u2212 p \u03a0\u2217\n) r\u0302 < p.(40)\nConsider a stochastic process (\u2126\u0303t)t\u22650 such that \u21260 = 1. At each subsequent date t \u2265 1, \u2126\u0303t remains equal to 1 with probability p, or snaps to 0 with probability 1 \u2212 p, in which case it stays equal to\n20Such a p exists since r < r\u0302 < 1.\n19\nthis value forever after. The realizations of \u2126\u0303t are public information. We also construct a strictly positive sequence (bt)t\u2208N such that bt+1 = r\u0302[1 + (1\u2212 p)/(p\u03a0\u2217)]bt < bt.\nProposition 7. (An equilibrium with unstable goods and assets prices) If b0 is sufficiently small other things being equal, there exists a sunspot equilibrium such that:\n\u2022 As long as \u2126\u0303t = 1, prices are rigid and agents trade a monetary bubble with date-t value bt. The policy rate is r\u0302, the real rate r\u0302[p+ (1\u2212 p)/\u03a0\u2217].\n\u2022 At the stopping time \u03c4 such that \u2126\u0303\u03c4 = 0, the bubble bursts, prices becomes flexible, and CPI inflation jumps to \u03a0\u2217 and then stays at this level forever, so that the policy rate becomes r\u03a0\u2217\nand the real rate becomes r.\nProof. See Appendix A.6.\nThis sunspot equilibrium offers a concrete illustration of the far-reaching instability induced by fixed menu costs. The multiplicity of perfect-foresight equilibria stated in Proposition 6 translates here into purely endogenous risk added to the prices of goods and that of assets in an economy that faces no fundamental uncertainty, nor any uncertainty regarding monetary policy. First, strategic complementarity in the setting of goods prices creates room for stochastic changes in inflation. Second, the initial episode of nominal rigidity comes with a low real rate that unlocks the possibility of monetary bubbles. Even though the particular sunspot equilibrium studied here is only a possibility among many others, it shares with any equilibrium such that the economy reverts to flexible prices at some point the feature that monetary bubbles must be stochastic, and burst no later than at this point. If the bubble was attached to a particular asset, as it bursts right when the real rate increases, the bubble would amplify the impact of the variations of the interest rate on the asset price.21\nThese particular equilibrium dynamics echo some of the narratives in the popular press along the lines that \u201call the liquidity created by central banks only feeds asset bubbles\u201d. In the first phase of the equilibrium, a bubble grows. Investment and inflation remain subdued despite a low policy rate. The start of the second phase mirrors the current concern that the Fed response to a bout of inflation may \u201cburst bubbles\u201d."

Bubbles as pure monetary phenomena starkly differ from natural ones in three interesting ways. First, they are compatible with an environment of low expected returns and earn low expected returns themselves regardless of their size. Second, they burst when CPI inflation picks up. Finally, unlike natural bubbles that may be either good or bad for investment, monetary bubbles always hurt the most productive but constrained agents of the economy by diverting resources away from them.\nOne interesting route for future research consists in analyzing a version of our model in which sufficient heterogeneity across firms warrants equilibrium uniqueness in price setting. Still, strong strategic complementarities would have an important multiplier effect. We conjecture that there could be room for episodes of sticky prices and stochastic monetary bubbles during regimes of monetary easing, provided these regimes end in a stochastic fashion and keep a sufficiently high probability of continuation at each point in time."
