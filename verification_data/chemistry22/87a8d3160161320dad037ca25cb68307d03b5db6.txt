The portion of the text mentioning future research directions is not explicitly highlighted in the provided text. However, the conclusion and acknowledgment sections typically summarize findings and may hint at future directions indirectly by mentioning limitations or suggesting the utility of the research for further studies. Based on the provided text, the closest to suggesting future research directions is:

"Some limitations are connected with biodegradation of dyes using P. aeruginosa, such as high concentration of dyes and lack of suitable physiochemical and environmental conditions. So, these conditions should be considered during the degradation study."

This sentence implies that future research could focus on overcoming these limitations, possibly by exploring the degradation process under various conditions or by using different bacterial strains.
