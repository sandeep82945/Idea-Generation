    "abstractText": "Trauma-related injuries in traffic-accident victims can be quite serious. Evaluating the factors contributing to traffic accidents is critical for the effective design of programs aimed at reducing traffic accidents. Therefore, this study identified which factors related to traffic accidents are associated with injury severity in hospitalized victims. Factors related to traffic accidents, injury severity, disability and data collected from blood toxicology were evaluated, along with associated severity and disability indices with data collected from toxicology on victims of traffic accidents at the largest tertiary hospital in Latin America. One hundred and twenty-eight victims of traffic accidents were included, of whom the majority were young adult men, motorcyclists, and pedestrians. The most frequent injuries were traumatic brain injury and lower-limb fractures. Alcohol use, hit-and-run victims, and longer hospital stays were shown to lead to greater injury severity. Women, elderly individuals, and pedestrians tend to suffer greater disability post-injury. Therefore, traffic accidents occur more frequently among young male adults, motorcyclists, and those who are hit by a vehicle, with trauma to the head and lower limbs being the most common injury. Injury severity is greater in pedestrians, elderly individuals and inebriated individuals. Disability was higher in older individuals, in women, and in pedestrians.",

Low-income countries suffer the highest number of traffic accidents compared to more economically advantaged countries [4]. In 2014, more than 50% of all deaths from traffic accidents among all countries in the Americas occurred in Brazil [4].

The Shapiro\u2013Wilk test was used to verify whether the variables had a normal distribution. Comparisons of the mean values of the continuous variables, separated by cluster were performed using the Mann\u2013Whitney U test. Associations between categorical variables were analyzed using Pearson\u2019s Chi-square or Fisher\u2019s Exact Test. Cluster and decision tree analyzes were performed in R software, version 4.2.1.\nA significance level of 5% was used throughout the statistical analysis.\n2.3.1. Cluster Analysis\nClustering is an unsupervised learning method that assists professionals in discovering hidden patterns in a dataset [8]. The software packages cluster and extra fact were used. The K-means clustering algorithm was used to divide participants into groups based on their characteristics. K-means clustering is one of the most widely used clustering algorithms. This method partitions the data into clusters or groups so that data that have the same characteristics are grouped into the same cluster, and data that have different characteristics are grouped into other groups [9]. The algorithm requires the availability of two key operations on the data: first, a distance metric to compare a pair of data objects, and second, a way to compute a representative (centroid) for a given set of data objects.\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 853 4 of 14\nThe K-means algorithm is made up of two different phases. In the first phase, the K centers (centroids) are selected randomly, while the second phase allocates each data point to the closest center. Thus, the data were converted into a Z-score and entered into the algorithm. Two clusters were maintained considering the homogeneity in the derived groups and the balance between the classes [10]. The group was examined to confirm the final number of clusters and whether the group was sufficiently large with adequate statistical power defined as at least 10% of the total sample. To determine the appropriate number of K values in K means, we used the silhouette score value of different ranges of clusters to determine the appropriate number of K values for the dataset. Furthermore, the cluster distance measurements were performed using Euclidean distances [11]. The analysis was performed in such a way that intracluster similarity was high and the intercluster similarity is low.\n2.3.2. Decision Tree\nFor the analysis and construction of the decision tree predictor model, the rpart (recursive partitioning and regression trees) algorithm was used and the outcomes defined for prediction were RTS (mortality), ISS (injury severity) and FIM (disability). To build the model, variables specifically related to mortality, injury severity, and disability in traffic accident victims were selected after considering clinical practice, the literature relevant to the topic, and research experience. The variables selected included age, sex, use of alcohol and drugs, days of hospitalization and schooling. The model with the decision tree algorithm identifies the factors with the greatest influence on the outcome under analysis based on the attributes that best divide the dataset [12]. The e1071 package was used to build the model with the following parameters defined: (1) cp = 0.019 (a complexity parameter that eliminates any division that does not improve the fit of the model), (2) maxdepth = 3 (minimum number of observations that must exist in a node), and (3) xval = 10 (number cross-validation)."

            "text": "The traffic-accident victims included in this study were predominantly young, white men. The epidemiological profile of morbidity in the present study is similar to that of the rest\nof Brazil and the world based on the available data [13\u201317]. A 2017 study in the Brazilian state of Paran\u00e1 showed that 76.5% of traffic accident victims were men aged 32.2 years, similar to other data from Brazil, Africa, Asia and Europe [4,5,13,14,18]. Factors such as behavior (drug use, speed) and exposure (greater use of motorcycles for transportation and work) explain these numbers and point to a need for more specific accident prevention programs [11\u201313]. Speed, a key causal factor in traffic-related accidents as identified by the WHO, is corroborated as such in the present study by the higher incidence of accidents on expressways [3]. It is also important to note that most victims were motorcyclists and pedestrians. This study evaluated only hospitalized victims with more serious injuries and showed the highest risk of accidents to motorcyclists and pedestrians. The predominance of accidents involving motorcyclists, however, is not consistent with international data. Studies from low- and middle-income countries show that motorcyclists, pedestrians, and cyclists are more vulnerable to traffic-related accidents [4,5,13\u201315]. However, studies from higherincome countries show that passengers or drivers of four-wheel vehicles suffer more frequently from traffic-related accidents [3]. These differences can be attributed to several factors: underreporting, socioeconomic differences, and the greater use of motorcycles in the poorest countries as a means of work and transport. In Brazil, the use of motorcycles as a means of transportation has grown exponentially in the last 20 years, which, in tandem with the more recent economic and employment crises, has increased the number of motorcyclists who rely on this form of transport for work-related activities as a motorcycle courier or employee of an online delivery app [19]. Most motorcyclists in this study wore helmets regularly (98.6%), a finding likely attributable to laws requiring helmets and fines associated with violating these laws. However, the use of other types of personal protective equipment (jackets, boots, gloves) and protective equipment attached to the motorcycle (antenna and lower limb protector) was much less predominant. The uncommon use of boots (26.4%) and lower limb protectors (22.4%) shows the lack of understanding on the part of the motorcyclists of the importance of protecting the lower limbs, which are the most common site of injury in these accidents. Additionally, the lack of seat belt use (44.4%) in four-wheel vehicle occupants was observed despite being legally mandatory and finable. The lack of seatbelt usage is likely correlated with injury severity. These data reinforce the need for ongoing programs and campaigns of guidance and education on traffic safety. The WHO highlights that the use of safety items significantly reduces the severity of injuries and the number of deaths from traffic accidents [3]. Two main, distinct groups were identified in our study based on cluster analysis between which no intersection was definitively shown. Cluster 2 was observed as experiencing a more severe clinical condition, increased length of hospitalization, higher risk of death, greater injury severity, and more severe functional disability. In addition, Cluster 2 was shown to require more helicopter assistance than Cluster 1, an observation that indicates increased injury severity in this cohort. In Cluster 2, more patients whose mechanism of injury was being hit by a vehicle were observed, which may explain the worse clinical picture in this group. There was no statistical significance of alcohol and drugs in the two groups in the cluster, despite alcohol having a similar value (p = 0.08/Table 5), demonstrating that Cluster 2 had more patients under the influence of alcohol than Cluster 1. This finding suggests that alcohol may play a role in the more severe clinical condition observed in Cluster 2. Interestingly, marijuana and cocaine did not show the same relationship, possibly because few patients were actually found to have used these drugs prior to their accident. Ponce et al. found that almost 50% of deaths from traffic accidents in S\u00e3o Paulo are a consequence of alcohol use [20]. Even low blood alcohol concentrations are capable of interfering with cognitive functions important for driving, namely attention and concentration, executive function, perception, psychomotor skills, reaction time, and vigilance.\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 853 11 of 14\nAlcohol impairs driving skills such as attending to traffic signs, detecting road hazards and braking the vehicle [21]. The use of alcohol is positively correlated with injury severity, which is consistent with data from the Brazilian and the international literature [22,23]. Most studies show that the risk of traffic-related accidents resulting in serious injury increases substantially in collisions involving individuals under the influence of illicit drugs [24,25]. Marijuana affects driving performance as it slows the driver\u2019s reaction time to external stimuli [24]. Cocaine, by contrast, can lead to reckless driving in addition to overalertness and even nervousness [25]. This relationship was not observed in the present study, possibly due to their statistically low power in the setting of few patients having used such substances. Traumatic brain injury (TBI) and lower-limb injuries (fractures) were the most frequently diagnosed conditions, findings consistent with other literature evaluating a similar population [14\u201316]. TBI is a serious injury that is quite common in traffic-related accidents, especially among motorcyclists and pedestrians. Lower-limb injuries are also very common because of the high frequency of motorcycle accidents [5,13,14]. Among the predictors of mortality, it was found that individuals with an increased length of hospitalization and over 43 years old had a higher risk of death than those under 43 years of age. Additionally, among the individuals with shorter lengths of hospitalization (less than 15 days), older individuals had a high risk of death than younger individuals. McCoy points out that the elderly suffer more deaths than younger people from traffic accidents [26]. Individuals aged 43 years or less and hospitalized between 15 and 17 days were observed to have a higher risk of death than those hospitalized for greater than 17 days. That younger patients hospitalized between 15 and 17 days had a higher risk of death could be attributable to the severity of injury to organic structures as related to the mechanism of trauma and the more generally reckless behavior observed among younger people, who more frequently suffer from traffic-related accidents [13\u201315]. Equally as important as the other aforementioned predictors of injury severity based on this study is the observation that an increased length of hospitalization was positively correlated with injury severity. Chalya et al. found that traffic accident victims with longer hospital stays had more severe injuries (TBI and limb fractures), which required a prolonged healing period. These data are similar to those of the present study [27]. In the FIM predictor model, older victims hospitalized between 12 and 38 days experienced greater functional disability than older victims with more than 38 days of hospitalization. This finding seems paradoxical and contradicts most of the current literature as the length of hospitalization is positively correlated with injury severity. However, it is possible that older patients recover less fully at post-hospital discharge than younger patients, which may explain this finding. It is worth noting that older people may require more care after discharge to achieve a fuller functional recovery. This seemingly paradoxical result might also be explained by the relatively low number of elderly patients observed with more than 38 days of hospitalization (5% of the sample, Figure 4). No studies were identified that specifically verified the relationship between length of hospitalization and degree of functional disability in older individuals. Rocha et al. analyzed traffic-accident victims over 20 years of age and reported that an increased length of hospitalization is positively correlated with the degree of functional disability and injury severity [28]. Among younger patients overall in this study, women had greater functional disability than men. However, data in the literature on the disability rate by sex in traffic accidents are controversial. Esiyok et al. found a higher frequency of disability among men than women; Ferrando found no difference between men and women; and Berecki-Gisolf found that female sex is a risk factor for disability, ostensibly due to women experiencing more pain [29\u201331]. Ultimately, the results of this study highlight the core behaviors that drive trafficrelated accidents: alcohol, speed, lack of adherence to the use of recommended safety equipment, recklessness, and the overall riskier profile for motorcyclists and pedestrians. The ability to reduce morbidity and mortality due to traffic-related accidents depends on\nInt. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2023, 20, 853 12 of 14\nimproving population-wide education on road safety as well as identifying and prosecuting drivers who pose a safety, and thus health, risk to the general population. Public prevention policies need to be comprehensive, inclusive and permanent, as socioeconomic and educational inequality and access to employment and work forces a large proportion of young people to use motorcycles as their primary work tool, such as couriers or app delivery people. A few limitations of the present study include cases lost to follow up in the emergency department, difficulty collecting information from patients suffering from the gravest injuries, and the omission or even falsification of information provided in the patients\u2019 self-reports about their accidents."
