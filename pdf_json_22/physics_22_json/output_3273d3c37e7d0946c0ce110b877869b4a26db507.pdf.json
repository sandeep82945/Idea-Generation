    "abstractText": "In this paper, we investigate generalized volume-complexity Cgen for a two-sided uncharged HV black brane in d+2 dimensions. This quantity which was recently introduced in [48], is an extension of volume in the Complexity=Volume (CV) proposal, by adding higher curvature corrections with a coupling constant \u03bb to the volume functional. We numerically calculate the growth rate of Cgen for different values of the hyperscaling violation exponent \u03b8 and dynamical exponent z. It is observed that Cgen always grows linearly at late times provided that we choose \u03bb properly. Moreover, it approaches its late time value from below. For the case \u03bb = 0, we find an analytic expression for the late time growth rate for arbitrary values of \u03b8 and z. However, for \u03bb 6= 0, the late time growth rate can only be calculated analytically for some specific values of \u03b8 and z. We also examine the dependence of the growth rate on d, \u03b8, z and \u03bb. Furthermore, we calculate the complexity of formation obtained from volume-complexity and show that it is not UV divergent. We also examine its dependence on the thermal entropy and temperature of the black brane. At the end, we also numerically calculate the growth rate of Cgen for the case where the higher curvature corrections are a linear combination of the Ricci scalar, square of the Ricci tensor and square of the Riemann tensor. We show that for appropriate values of the coupling constants, the late time growth rate is again linear.",

            "text": "In the last two decades, we witnessed that quantum information quantities such as entanglement entropy and quantum complexity have been very fruitful in understanding the AdS/CFT correspondence (see [1\u20133] for a review). Quantum complexity is defined as the minimum number of simple unitary operations required to prepare a given state form an initial reference state [4]. One of the intriguing features of quantum complexity is that it continues to grow long after the time at which entanglement entropy saturates [3, 5\u20139]. Therefore, it is widely believed that it can provide information about the interior of black holes. In the context of AdS/CFT [10], there are two main proposals for the calculation of quantum complexity: Complexity=Volume (CV) [6, 7] and Complexity=Action (CA) [8, 9].\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 0 5\nIt should be pointed out that volume-complexity1 was also introduced for some subregions in the bulk spacetime such as in a region [11, 12] enclosed by a (H)RT hypersurface [13, 14] or inside a Wheeler-DeWitt (WDW) patch [15].2 Various aspects of the CV and CA proposals have been explored extensively in the literature [16\u201351] such as: subregion complexity [52\u201367], complexity of formation [21, 68\u201370], in Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity [71\u201373], for higher derivative gravity [74\u201376], for Kerr-AdS black holes [69, 77], at finite radial cutoff [72, 78\u201382], structure of the UV divergent terms [62, 70, 83\u201385], regularization methods [70, 85] and covariant counterterms on spacelike/timelike [21, 70, 72, 78\u201382, 84\u201386] or null [21, 70, 84\u201386] boundaries or joint points [87] of the WDW patch. For a detailed review refer to [3]. Moreover, quantum complexity was also investigated form the QFT point of view [38, 39, 42, 88\u2013126]. According to the CV proposal [6, 7], the complexity of a state on a constant time slice \u03a3\u03c4 in a holographic CFT is given by the volume V (\u03a3(\u03c4)) of an extremal codimension-one hypersurface \u03a3(\u03c4) in the bulk spacetime3\nCV = max \u2202\u03a3(\u03c4)=\u03a3\u03c4 [ V (\u03a3(\u03c4)) `GN ] = max \u2202\u03a3(\u03c4)=\u03a3\u03c4 [ 1 GNL \u222b \u03a3(\u03c4) dd+1\u03c3 \u221a h ] . (1.1)\nHere \u03a3(\u03c4) is anchored on the left and right asymptotic boundaries of the bulk spacetime at times tL and tR such that \u2202\u03a3(\u03c4) = \u03a3\u03c4 (see figure 1). Moreover, h is the induced metric on \u03a3(\u03c4) and ` is a dimensionful constant which can be either the AdS radius L or the black hole horizon radius rh. In the following, we set ` = L. Recently, CV proposal was generalized in ref. [48] and the following functional was introduced as the holographic dual of quantum complexity\nOF1,\u03a3F2 (\u03a3\u03c4 ) = 1\nGNL \u222b \u03a3F2 dd+1\u03c3 \u221a h F1 (g\u00b5\u03bd ;X\u00b5) . (1.2)\nHere the integral is taken on a codimension-one hypersurface \u03a3F2 in the bulk spacetime which is anchored on the boundary of the bulk spacetime such that \u2202\u03a3F2 = \u03a3\u03c4 where \u03a3\u03c4 is a constant time slice in the boundary where the dual CFT lives. Moreover, it is parametrized by the coordinates X\u00b5(\u03c3i) and \u03c3i are the coordinates in the bulk spacetime. F1,2 (g\u00b5\u03bd , X\u00b5) are arbitrary scalar functions of the bulk metric g\u00b5\u03bd and X\u00b5(\u03c3i). Furthermore, h is the determinant of the induced metric on \u03a3F2 , and the hypersurface \u03a3F2 is determined by extremizing the following functional [48]\n\u03b4X (\u222b \u03a3F2 dd+1\u03c3 \u221a h F2 (g\u00b5\u03bd ;X\u00b5) ) = 0. (1.3)\nTherefore, F2 determines the hypersurface \u03a3F2 on which the integral in eq. (1.2) is taken and F1 determines OF1,\u03a3F2 . It should be pointed out that F1 and F2 are two independent functions. However, for F1 = F2, eq. (1.2) can be simplified as follows\nCgen(\u03c4) = max \u2202\u03a3(\u03c4)=\u03a3\u03c4\n[ 1\nGNL \u222b \u03a3(\u03c4) dd+1 \u03c3 \u221a h F1 (g\u00b5\u03bd ;X\u00b5(\u03c3)) ] , (1.4)\n1We call the holographic complexity in the CV proposal volume-complexity. 2This proposal is also called CV2.0. 3Here, we assume that the bulk spacetime is d+ 2 dimensional.\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 0 5\nwhere \u03c4 = 2tL = 2tR,4 and tL,R are the time coordinates in the left and right CFTs. Moreover, for F1 = F2 = 1, the functional in eq. (1.2) reduces to the volume functional in the CV proposal, i.e. eq. (1.1). Since Cgen is a generalization of the volume-complexity, it is dubbed generalized volume-complexity. It should also be emphasize that the extremal hypersurface \u03a3(\u03c4) approaches a constant-r hypersurface at r = rf at late times, i.e. \u03c4 \u2192\u221e, which is called the final slice [7, 48] (see figure 1). Moreover, it was shown in ref. [48] that finding the extremal hypersurface \u03a3(\u03c4) in eq. (1.4), is analogous to study the motion of a classical non-relativistic particle in an effective potential U\u0302(r) with the action S \u221d Cgen. In this manner, extremizing equations for Cgen are equivalent to the equations of motion of the particle (see eqs. (3.7) and (3.8)).5 Furthermore, the growth rate of Cgen behaves as follows [48]\ndCgen d\u03c4 = 12Pt |\u2202\u03a3(t), (1.5)\nwhere Pt is the momentum conjugate to the time coordinate t. Therefore, to have a linear growth rate at late times, Pt has to be a constant at late times. It was also shown in ref. [48] that, it happens whenever the effective potential has a local maximum inside the horizon. Therefore, investigating the local maxima of U\u0302(r) is crucial. The aim of the paper is to explore the generalized volume-complexity for a two-sided Hyperscaling Violating (HV) black brane [127] in d+ 2 dimensions. Different aspects of this background have been studied in the literature such as: Page curve [128], VolumeComplexity [23]6 and Action-Complexity [23, 24, 81]. Similar to ref. [48], we consider the following case\nF1 (g\u00b5\u03bd ;X\u00b5(\u03c3)) = F2 (g\u00b5\u03bd ;X\u00b5(\u03c3)) = 1 + \u03bbL4C2, (1.6)\nwhere C2 = C\u03b1\u03b2\u00b5\u03bdC\u03b1\u03b2\u00b5\u03bd is the square of the Weyl tensor in the bulk and L is a length scale which reduces to the AdS radius when \u03b8 = 0 and z = 1. Moreover, \u03bb is a dimensionless coupling constant and it can have any value. However, we will see that asking for Cgen to have a linear growth at late times, imposes a constraint on the value of \u03bb. We calculate generalized volume-complexity for the two cases \u03bb = 0 and \u03bb 6= 0, separately. For both cases, we numerically obtain the growth rate of Cgen. For \u03bb = 0, we find analytically the growth rate. However, for \u03bb 6= 0, we can find it analytically for some specific cases: 1) \u03b8 = 0 and arbitrary values of d and z, 2) d = 2, \u03b8 = 1 and z = 1. We also prove that dCgend\u03c4 reaches its late time value from below similar to AdS black holes. Moreover, we write the growth rate in terms of the effective potential of a classical non-relativistic particle and investigate its maxima in detail. On the other hand, we calculate the complexity of formation \u2206CV obtained from volume-complexity and show that it is a UV finite quantity. Furthermore, for \u03b8 = 0, it is proportional to the thermal entropy S of the black brane. For \u03b8 6= 0, there are two cases de 6= \u03b8e and de = \u03b8e which have different kinds of UV divergent terms in CV ,\n4In the following, we consider symmetric hypersurfaces \u03a3\u03c4 for which tL = tR (see figure 1). Since \u03c4 = tL + tR, one has \u03c4 = 2tL = 2tR.\n5The same prescription also works for volume-complexity (see e.g. ref. [21]). 6It should be emphasized that our HV black brane solution is connected to that investigated in ref. [23].\nMore precisely, by changing the radial coordinate as rthere = L 2\nr \u03b8e F r\u03b8e\u22121here , the two solutions transform to each other. We would like to thank the referee for her/his helpful comments in this regard.\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 0 5\nand hence have to be considered separately. For the former, \u2206CV is proportional to ST\u2212 \u03b8e z where T is the temperature of the black brane. However, for the latter, it depends on logS. The outline of the paper is as follows: in section 2, we briefly review HV black branes. In section 3, we calculate generalized volume-complexity for this background. In section 4, we calculate the complexity of formation \u2206CV obtained from volume-complexity. In section 5, we summarize our results and discuss about future problems. Moreover, in appendix A, we investigate the connection between the radial cutoffs rmax of the black brane and vacuum. These results are necessary for the calculation of the complexity of formation. In appendix B, we study the generalized complexity for the case where F1 = F2 such that they are an arbitrary combination of Ricci scalar, square of the Ricci tensor and square of the Riemann tensor."

(2.3)\nMoreover, de = d \u2212 \u03b8 is the effective dimension [129] and \u03b8e = \u03b8d . The metric is given by [127, 130]7\nds2 = ( r\nrF\n)\u22122\u03b8e ( \u2212 ( r\nL\n)2z f(r)dt2 + L 2\nr2f(r)dr 2 + r\n2\nL2 d\u2211 i=1 dx2i\n) , (2.4)\nwhere f(r) = 1\u2212 ( rh r )de+z . (2.5) It should be emphasized that the solution has two parameters z and \u03b8 which are called the dynamical and hyperscaling violation exponents, respectively. Furthermore, under the following coordinate transformation [129]\nt\u2192 \u03bbzt xi \u2192 \u03bbxi r \u2192 \u03bb\u22121r, (2.6) 7Notice that there are two dimensionful parameters rF and rf which have very similar notations. Here, rF is the dynamical scale in the HV geometry and the metric in eq. (2.4) is only well-defined for r > rF [129, 131]. On the other hand, rf is the radial coordinate of the final r-constant hypersurface that the extremal surface \u03a3(\u03c4) approaches it at late times (see figure 1).\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 0 5\nthe metric (2.4) behaves as follows\nds\u2192 \u03bb\u03b8eds, (2.7)\nand hence it is not invariant. However, for \u03b8 = 0, the metric is scale invariant. Moreover, there is an anisotropy among the t and xi directions in eq. (2.6). Therefore, the Lorentz symmetry is also broken for z 6= 1. In other words, for \u03b8 = 0 and z = 1, the scaling and Lorentz symmetries are restored in the dual QFT. In this case, the solution reduces to a d+2 dimensional planar AdS-Schwarzschild black hole.8 Another important point is that the null energy condition imposes the following constraints on z and \u03b8 [129]\nde(d(z \u2212 1)\u2212 \u03b8) \u2265 0, (z \u2212 1)(de + z) \u2265 0. (2.8)\nMoreover, it was argued in ref. [127] that the solution is not valid for d = \u03b8. On the other hand, it was shown that the solution is not stable for d < \u03b8 [129]. Therefore, we restrict ourselves to the following cases\nz \u2265 1, d > \u03b8. (2.9)\nOn the other hand, the temperature and entropy of the black brane are given by [127, 130]\nT = (de + z)r z h 4\u03c0Lz+1 , S = Vdr de h r \u03b8 F 4GNLd . (2.10)\nMoreover, the mass is as follows [130]9\nM = de de + z TS = deVd16\u03c0GN rde+zh r \u03b8 F Ld+z+1 . (2.11)\nFurthermore, the tortoise coordinate is simply given by\nr\u2217(r) = \u222b\nLz+1\nrz+1f(r)dr, (2.12)\nwhich is a hypergeometric function of r [128]. However, we do not need the explicit form of r\u2217(r) here. It should be pointed out that this theory has a vacuum solution which is obtained by setting f(r) = 1 in eq. (2.4) [129, 132]\nds2 = ( r\nrF\n)\u22122\u03b8e ( \u2212 ( r\nL\n)2z dt2 + L 2\nr2 dr2 + r\n2\nL2 d\u2211 i=1 dx2i\n) , (2.13)\nwhose entropy and temperature are zero. In section 4, we need the volume-complexity of the vacuum to calculate the complexity of formation.\n8Notice that for z = 1, the gauge field is zero. Moreover, for \u03b8 = 0, the scalar field becomes a constant. In this case, V (\u03c6) plays the role of the cosmological constant.\n9In the literature, the metric of the transverse directions in eq. (2.4) is written as d\u21262d = 1L2 \u2211d i=1 dx 2 i .\nNotice that \u2126d = VdLd , where \u2126d and Vd are the volumes of the metrics d\u2126 2 d and \u2211d i=1 dx 2 i , respectively. Having said this, the entropy and mass of a HV black brane can be written as S = \u2126dr de h r\u03b8F\n4GN and M =\ndeVd 16\u03c0GN\nr de+z h r\u03b8F Lz+1 [130]. It should also pointed out that \u2126d is dimensionless and Vd has the dimension of lenght d.\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 0 5\n3 Generalized volume-complexity Cgen\nTo calculate the generalized volume-complexity in eq. (1.4), we proceed in the same manner as refs. [21, 48]. In the infalling Eddington-Finkelstein coordinate v = t+ r\u2217, the metric in eq. (2.4) can be written as follows\nds2 = ( r\nrF\n)\u22122\u03b8e ( \u2212 ( r\nL\n)2z f(r)dv2 + 2 ( r\nL\n)z\u22121 dv dr + r 2\nL2 d\u2211 i=1 dx2i\n) . (3.1)\nDue to the translational symmetry along the transverse directions xi=1\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,d, we parametrize the spacelike hypersurface \u03a3(\u03c4) as follows\n\u03a3(\u03c4) : (v(\u03c3), r(\u03c3), ~x) . (3.2)\nAs mentioned before, here we consider symmetric configurations for which one has tL = tR (see figure 1). Then one can write the generalized volume-complexity as follows\nCgen = Vd GNL\n\u222b d\u03c3 rde\u2212\u03b8e\nr \u2212\u03b8e(d+1) F L d\n\u221a \u2212 ( r\nL\n)2z f(r)v\u03072 + 2 ( r\nL\n)z\u22121 v\u0307r\u0307 a(r), (3.3)\nwhere a(r) = 1 + \u03bbL4C2, (3.4)\nand \u03bb is a dimensionless coupling constant. Moreover, \u201c.\u201d denotes the derivative with respect to the coordinate \u03c3 and Vd is the volume of the spatial directions xi=1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7d. Since Cgen is invariant under the diffeomorphism \u03c3 \u2192 g(\u03c3), we choose the following gauge (see also [48]) \u221a\n2v\u0307r\u0307 \u2212 ( r\nL\n)z+1 f(r)v\u03072 = ( r\nL\n) z\u22121 2 rde\u2212\u03b8e\nr \u2212\u03b8e(d+1) F L\nd a(r). (3.5)\nNow, one can compare the problem with that of the motion of a classical non-relativistic particle with action Cgen [48]. In this manner, extremizing Cgen gives the corresponding equations of motion for the particle. Having said this, since the metric (2.4) is stationary, the momentum Pv conjugate to the infalling time v is conserved10\nPv(\u03c4) = r\u0307 \u2212 ( r\nL\n)z+1 f(r)v\u0307 = const. (3.6)\nNext, by solving eqs. (3.5) and (3.6), one has\nr\u0307 = \u00b1 \u221a P 2v + r2(d+z\u2212\u03b8e(d+1))\nL2(d+z) r\n2\u03b8e(d+1) F a(r)2f(r), (3.7)\nv\u0307 = ( L\nr )z+1 1 f(r) \u2212Pv \u00b1 \u221a P 2v + r2(d+z\u2212\u03b8e(d+1)) L2(d+z) r 2\u03b8e(d+1) F a 2(r)f(r)  , (3.8) 10It should be emphasized that Pv is a function of the boundary time \u03c4 and for a given value of \u03c4 it is a\nconstant which is fixed by eq. (3.11).\n\u2013 6 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 0 5\nr = 0\nr = 0\nr =\n\u221e\nr = \u221e r = r hr = r h\nr =\nr m a x\nr =\nr m a x\nrmin \u03a3(\u03c4) tR = \u03c4 2tL = \u03c4 2\nr = rf\nFigure 1. The extremal codimension-one bulk hypersurface \u03a3(\u03c4) denoted in orange, starts from the left boundary at time tL, then goes inside the horizon and reaches the minimal radius rmin. Next, it goes outside the horizon and reaches the right asymptotic boundary at time tR. Here, we consider symmetric hypersurfaces where tL = tR = \u03c42 . At late times, i.e. \u03c4 \u2192 \u221e, it approaches a constant-r hypersurface dubbed final slice at r = rf which is denoted in blue. The red dashed curves are the radial cutoffs at r = rmax. Moreover, the magenta straight line denotes the extremal hypersurface anchored at tL = tR = 0 which is applied in the calculation of the complexity of formation in section 4.\nwhich extremize Cgen. In this case, the position of the particle is given by the coordinate r. On the other hand, the effective potential U\u0302(r) is defined by\nr\u03072 + U\u0302(r) = P 2v . (3.9)\nThen from eq. (3.7) and (3.9), one can easily find the effective potential U\u0302(r) as follows\nU\u0302(r) = \u2212r 2(d+z\u2212\u03b8e(d+1))\nL2(d+z) r\n2\u03b8e(d+1) F a 2(r)f(r). (3.10)\nFrom the above expression and eqs. (3.4) and (3.16), it is obvious that U\u0302(r) becomes zero at r = rh. Moreover, for r < rh, one has f(r) < 0, and hence U\u0302(r) is positive in the range 0 < r < rh.11 On the other hand, it is straightforward to show that for every value of the boundary time \u03c4 , the conserved momentum Pv is fixed by the following constraint\n\u03c4 = 2tR = \u22122 \u222b \u221e rmin dr Pv(\nr L\n)z+1 f(r) \u221a P 2v \u2212 U\u0302(r) , (3.11)\nwhere rmin is the minimal radius on the timelike surface t = 0 (see figure 1) at which one has [21, 48]\nr\u0307 \u2223\u2223 r=rmin = 0. (3.12)\n11It should be pointed out that for the case \u03bb = 0, one has a(r) = 1 and U\u0302(0) = 0. However, for the case \u03bb 6= 0, a(r) is divergent at r = 0. Therefore, U\u0302(r) is also divergent at r = 0.\n\u2013 7 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 0 5\nIn other words, rmin is the turning point of the particle moving in the potential U\u0302(r). On the other hand, from figure 1, it is clear that rmin is inside the horizon and at late times, one has rmin \u2192 rf [21, 48]. From eqs. (3.7), (3.10) and (3.12), one arrives at\nP 2v = \u2212 r 2(d+z\u2212\u03b8e(d+1)) min L2(d+z) r 2\u03b8e(d+1) F a 2(rmin)f(rmin)\n= U\u0302(rmin). (3.13)\nOn the other hand, at the maximum r = rf of U\u0302(r), one has [21, 48]\nU\u0302(rf ) = P 2\u221e, U\u0302 \u2032(rf ) = 0, U\u0302 \u2032\u2032(rf ) \u2264 0, (3.14)\nwhere P\u221e = lim\u03c4\u2192\u221e Pv(\u03c4). Notice that the first equation is a result of the fact that rf also satisfies eq. (3.12) and hence eq. (3.13) (see also ref. [21]). For later convenience, we change the radial coordinate as follows\nw = ( r\nrh\n)de+z . (3.15)\nFor the metric (3.1), the square of the Weyl tensor is simply given by\nC2 = (d\u2212 1)(d+ 1)L4 ( rh rF )4\u03b8e w 4\u03b8e de+z \u22122(de(de \u2212 z + 2)\u2212 2z(z \u2212 1)w)2. (3.16) Then the effective potential (3.10) can be written as follows\nU\u0302(w) = \u2212r 2(de+z\u2212\u03b8e) h\nL2(d+z) r\n2\u03b8e(d+1) F w\n2 ( 1\u2212 \u03b8e\nde+z ) ( 1\u2212 1\nw\n)\n\u00d7 (\n1 + \u03bb(d\u2212 1)(d+ 1) ( rh rF )4\u03b8e w 4\u03b8e de+z \u22122 (de(de \u2212 z + 2)\u2212 2z(z \u2212 1)w)2 )2 . (3.17)\nSince there is a factor of f(r) in the effective potential, it becomes zero at the horizon where w = 1. Moreover, it is also zero on the singularity at w = 0."

Next, by multiplying eq. (3.19)13 by Pv and adding it to eq. (3.18), one can rewrite the latter as follows\nCgen = 2Vd GNL {\u222b rmax rmin dr f(r) ( L r )z+1 [\u221a P 2v + r2(d+z\u2212\u03b8e(d+1)) L2(d+z) r 2\u03b8e(d+1) F a(r)2f(r)\u2212 Pv ]\n+ Pv ( tR + r\u2217\u221e \u2212 r\u2217(rmin) )} . (3.20)\nThen, by taking the derivative of the above expression with respect to the time tR, one obtains\ndCgen dtR = 2Vd GNL { dPv dtR \u222b rmax rmin dr ( L r )z+1 1 f(r) [ Pv\u221a\nP 2v + r 2(d+z\u2212\u03b8e(d+1)) L2(d+z) r 2\u03b8e(d+1) F a(r)2f(r)\n\u2212 1 ]\n+ dPv dtR\n( tR + r\u2217\u221e \u2212 r\u2217(rmin) ) + Pv } = Pv, (3.21)\nwhere in the last line we applied eq. (3.19). Since \u03c4 = 2tR, one can rewrite the above equation as follows\ndCgen d\u03c4 = Vd GNL Pv(\u03c4) = Vd GNL\n\u221a U\u0302(rmin), (3.22)\nwhere we used eq. (3.13). At late times, rmin \u2192 rf , and hence one has\nlim \u03c4\u2192\u221e dCgen d\u03c4 = Vd GNL P\u221e = Vd GNL\n\u221a U\u0302(rf ). (3.23)\nTherefore, the growth rate of Cgen at late times, is linear and determined by the value of the effective potential at r = rf . Notice that rf is a maximum of U\u0302(r) and is located inside the horizon. Therefore, the maximum of U\u0302(r) inside the horizon determines the growth rate of generalized volume-complexity at late times. In section 3.3, we investigate such maxima. Now, we want to prove that the generalized volume-complexity approaches its late time value in eq. (3.23) from below. To do so, we expand U\u0302(rmin) in eq. (3.22) around r = rf as follows\ndCgen d\u03c4 = Vd GNL\n[\u221a U\u0302(rf ) + U\u0302 \u2032\u2032(rf )(r \u2212 rf )2\n4 \u221a U(rf )\n+O ( (r \u2212 rf )3 ) ] , (3.24)\n13We change the upper limit of the integral in eq.

The corresponding values of \u03bb are shown in tables 3 and 4, respectively.

Figure 7 indicates that for the values of \u03bb in table 3, wfB is a maximum outside the horizon.

We also plotted it for the case \u03bb = 0, i.e. volume-complexity, which is indicated by the dashed black curve. We set L = rh = GN = Vd = 1 and rF = 0.5.\nOn the other hand, from eq. (3.58), it is clear that for a given value of d, \u03b8 and z, a(s) is an increasing function of \u03bb. Therefore, dCgend\u03c4 is also an increasing function of \u03bb.18 To verify this behavior, we also numerically plotted the growth rate for different values of \u03bb in figure 14.\nIt should be pointed out that to have the so-called linear growth rate at late times, one has to choose \u03bb properly such that the effective potential U\u0302(w) has a local maximum inside the horizon. In ref. [48], it was argued that for small values of \u03bb, such maximum always exists.19 In our case, depending on the value of d, \u03b8, z and \u03bb, the effective potential might have:\n1. no maxima neither inside nor outside the horizon (see figure 15)\n2. one maximum inside the horizon and no maximum outside the horizon (see figure 16)\n3. no maximum inside the horizon and one maximum outside the horizon (see figure 17)\n4. one maximum inside the horizon and another one outside the horizon (see figure 18)\n5. two maxima outside the horizon (see figure 19).\n18This behavior can also be seen from eqs. (3.17) and (3.22). It is clear that U\u0302(w) is an increasing function of \u03bb.\n19For an AdS-Schwarzschild black brane, depending on the value of the coupling constant, U\u0302(w) might have 1) no maxima neither inside nor outside the horizon 2) one maximum inside the horizon 3) one maximum outside the horizon. Refer to figure 3 in ref. [48].\n\u2013 22 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 0 5\nIt is interesting to know what happens to the growth rate when there is no maximum inside the horizon.20 To address this question, in figures21 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19 we considered an example for each of the above cases, respectively. In figure 15, we considered the case d = 2, \u03b8 = 0, z = 1 and \u03bb = 5 \u00d7 10\u22123 > 112\u03bbcrt,1. In this case, according to table 4, there is no maximum inside the horizon, and hence the growth rate does not show the so-called linear growth at late times. In the left panel of figure 15, we plotted the effective potential which shows that there are no maxima neither inside nor outside the horizon. In the middle panel of the figure, we plotted \u03c4 as a function of smin = rminrh . It is observed that when smin is large enough, for each value of \u03c4 there are two values of rmin. In the right panel of the figure, we plotted dCgend\u03c4 as a function of \u03c4/\u03b2. There are two branches which are indicated in orange and blue. Therefore, for each value of \u03c4 , there are two values of dCgend\u03c4 , and hence two branches for dCgend\u03c4 .22 In the middle panel of the figure, the blue curve has a larger value of rmin in comparison to the orange curve. Moreover, by looking at figure 1, as the time increases the endpoints of the extremal surface, e.g. the orange curve in figure 1, moves upward. In this case, the value of rmin decreases and reaches rf at late times. Next, by looking at the middle panel in figure 15, it is evident that on the orange curve as \u03c4 increases rmin increases. On the other hand, on the blue curve, as \u03c4 increases, rmin decreases. Therefore, the correct values of rmin are given by the blue curve in the middle panel. Consequently, it is expected that the correct values of dCgend\u03c4 are given by the blue curve in the right panel. It should also be pointed out that the blue curve for dCgend\u03c4 in the right panel does not show the linear growth rate at late times, and even is faster than linear. It is widely believed that the quantum complexity\n20We would like to thank the referee for raising this intriguing question.

The late time growth rate is negative and a decreasing function of \u03c4 . Notice that since the growth rate is negative this case is not physical.\nand hence its gravity dual show a linear growth rate at late times (see for example [3]). Therefore, this case in which the late time behavior is not linear seems not to be physical. In figure 16, we considered the case, d = 3, \u03b8 = 0, z = 3 and \u03bb = 10\u22122. In this case, there is just one maximum wfB1 and it is located inside the horizon. The growth rate is linear at late times and its value is given by the value of U\u0302(w) at wfB1 according to eq. (3.23). In figure 17, we considered the case d = 2, \u03b8 = 0, z = 1 and \u03bb = \u22120.2. In this case, there is just one maximum wfA1 which is located outside the horizon. The growth rate is negative and is a decreasing function of \u03c4/\u03b2. Therefore, this case is not physical.\nIn figure 18, we considered the case d = 2, \u03b8 = 0, z = 2 and \u03bb = \u22120.3. In this case, there is a maximum wfA2 inside the horizon and another one wfB3 outside the horizon. The growth rate at late times is linear and given by the value of U\u0302(w) at wfA2 according to eq. (3.23). It should be pointed out that when there are two maxima, one should choose the maximum which gives a larger value for Cgen. In figure 19, we considered the case d = 4, \u03b8 = 0, z = 2 and \u03bb = \u22120.25. In this case, there are two maxima wfA1,2 which both of them are located outside the horizon. The growth rate at late times is not linear and it is negative. Therefore, this case is not physical.\n\u2013 24 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 0 5\n0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 -40 -20 0\n20\n40\n60\nw\n\u00db\nd=4, \u03b8=0, z=2 and \u03bb= -0.25\n0.00 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.30 0.35 -14 -12 -10 -8 -6 -4 -2 0\n\u03c4/\u03b2\ndC ge n\nd \u03c4\nFigure 19.

Right) The growth rate dCgend\u03c4 in terms of \u03c4/\u03b2. It is negative and a decreasing function of \u03c4/\u03b2, and hence it is not physical.\nTherefore, from figures 15, 16, 17, 18 and 19, one might conclude that only when the coupling constant \u03bb is chosen such that the effective potential has a maximum inside the horizon, the growth rate behaves linearly at late times. If there is not a maximum inside the horizon, either the growth rate is negative or increases faster than linear at late times. For this reason, throughout the paper we focused on the cases where there is a maximum inside the horizon."

In the above formula, C can be either volume-complexity [68] or action-complexity [21, 68, 70]. Here, we apply it for CV. In this case, the vacuum, i.e. the zero-temperature HV geometry, is given by eq. (2.13). To calculate \u2206CV, we consider an extremal hypersurface which is anchored at tL = tR = 0. By symmetry, the extremal hypersurface is a bulk surface for which t = 0 (see the magenta straight line in figure 1). In this case, from eq. (1.4), one simply obtains Cgen of the black brane as follows\nCgen = 2Vdr\u03b8e(d+1)F GNLd \u222b rmax rh rde\u2212\u03b8e\u22121\u221a f(r) a(r)dr.

It should be pointed out that the radial cutoff rmax in the black brane (BB) geometry and the vacuum are different. Therefore, to calculate the complexity of formation in eq. (4.1), one has to find the relation between the two cutoffs rBBmax and rVacmax. However, both geometries have the same radial cutoff at z = \u03b4 in the Fefferman-Graham (FG) coordinate. We investigate this connection in appendix A."

            "text": "In this paper, we studied the generalized volume-complexity Cgen which is an extension of volume-complexity for a two-sided uncharged HV black brane in d+ 2 dimensions. We considered the case where the two functionals F1 and F2 are equal to each other such that F1 = F2 = 1 + \u03bbC2. Here C2 is the square of the Weyl tensor of the background and \u03bb is a dimensionless coupling constant. We investigated the two cases \u03bb = 0 and \u03bb 6= 0, separately. For both cases, it was proved that the growth rate of generalized volume-complexity at late times, i.e. lim\u03c4\u2192\u221e dCgend\u03c4 , is determined by the maxima of the effective potential U\u0302(r) which are located inside the horizon (see eq. (3.23)). Therefore, we also investigated these maxima.\nFor the case, \u03bb = 0, Cgen reduces to the volume-complexity CV in the CV proposal. In this case, the effective potential U\u0302(w) has a simple maximum inside the horizon. Therefore, one is able to analytically calculate the late time growth rate (see eq. (3.29)). We also numerically calculated the growth rate dCVd\u03c4 of volume-complexity (see figures 2, 3 and 4) for different values of d, \u03b8 and z. It was observed that it always saturates to a constant value at late times and reaches this value from below. Furthermore, it is an increasing function of d, and is a decreasing function of the dynamical exponent z (see figures 2 and 3). However, it is neither an increasing nor a decreasing function of \u03b8 (see figure 4). For the case \u03bb 6= 0, we calculated numerically the growth rate dCgend\u03c4 of generalized volume-complexity (see figures 11, 12, 13 and 14) for different values of d, \u03b8, z and \u03bb. It was observed that for appropriate ranges of \u03bb, it saturates to a constant value at late times and reaches this value from below. Furthermore, it is neither an increasing nor a decreasing function of d and z (see figures 11 and 12). However, it is an increasing function of the exponent \u03b8 (see figure 13). Moreover, it is an increasing function of \u03bb (see figure 14).\nOn the other hand, for the case \u03bb 6= 0, we also examined the maxima of U\u0302(w). It was observed that for arbitrary values of d, \u03b8 and z, there are no analytical solutions to equation U\u0302 \u2032\u2032(w) = 0. However, for the following cases one can find analytical solutions: 1) \u03b8 = 0 and arbitrary values of d and z, 2) d = 2, \u03b8 = 1 and z = 1. It was observed that for the case \u03b8 = 0, i.e. Lifshitz black branes, there are three possible local maxima wfA1, wfA2 and wfB depending on the value of the coupling constant \u03bb. Theses values were reported in tables 1, 2, 3 and 4. The maxima at w = wfA1,2 are always located outside the horizon (see figures 5 and 6), and hence have no significance. On the other hand, the maximum at w = wfB is located either inside or outside the horizon depending on the value of \u03bb (see figures 7 and 8). Moreover, for the case d = 2, \u03b8 = 1 and z = 1, the appropriate range of \u03bb is given by eq. (3.55). It should be pointed out that for \u03b8 = 0 and z = 1, the HV black brane becomes a planar AdS-Schwarzschild black hole and all of our results reduce to those reported in ref. [48].\nOn the other hand, we calculated the growth rate of generalized complexity in appendix B for the case where F1 = F2 and they are a linear combination of the Ricci scalar, square of the Ricci tensor and square of the Riemann tensor (see eq. (B.1)). It was observed that by choosing the coupling constants \u03bb1,2,3 properly such that the effective potential has a maximum inside the horizon, the growth rate again has a linear behavior at late times.\nFurthermore, we calculated the complexity of formation \u2206CV obtained from volumecomplexity. We observed that the UV divergent terms in CV both for the black brane and\n\u2013 30 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 0 5\nthe vacuum geometries cancel each other exactly. Therefore, in the limit \u03b4 \u2192 0, where \u03b4 is the radial cutoff in the Fefferman-Graham coordinate, \u2206CV is finite. For the case \u03b8 = 0, it is proportional to the thermal entropy S of the black brane (see eq. (4.13)). On the other hand, for the case \u03b8 6= 0 and de 6= \u03b8e, it can be analytically calculated for some values of d and \u03b8. For these values, it was observed that \u2206CV is proportional to ST\u2212 \u03b8e z , where T is the temperature of the black brane (see eq. (4.19)). Moreover, for the case \u03b8 6= 0 and de = \u03b8e, it depends on logS (see eq. (4.24)). It should be pointed out that for AdS black holes, one has \u2206CV \u221d S [68]. Therefore, the behavior of \u2206CV for the case \u03b8 6= 0 is very intriguing. In particular, the logarithmic behavior for the case de 6= \u03b8e, and it would be very interesting to further investigate it. Eventually, in ref. [21], the effect of nonzero charge on volume-complexity CV was explored for charged planar AdS black holes. It was observed that for a given temperature, by increasing the charge, the growth rate of CV decreases. It would be interesting to investigate the effect of charge on generalized volume-complexity Cgen by considering charged HV or AdS black holes. Moreover, it would be also interesting to study different scalar functional F1 of the background curvature as well as cases in which the functionals F1 and F2 are not equal to each other. Another interesting direction to pursue is to extend these calculations to the HV black hole solutions found in ref. [130] or Kerr-AdS black holes whose volume-complexity were recently studied in ref. [69]."

[68], and work in the Fefferman-Graham (FG) coordinate. We assume that both the black brane geometry and the vacuum have the same radial cutoff at z = \u03b4 in the FG coordinate. We write the metric (2.4) in the FG coordinate\nds2 = L 2\nz2\n( dz2 + gij(z, xi)dxidxj ) , (A.1)\nwhere gij(z, xi) is the boundary metric. For an asymptotically AdS spacetime the coordinates z and r are connected as follows25\nz = L 2\nr + a1 r2 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7+ ad rd+2 + ad+2 rd+3 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (A.2)\n25Notice that we work in d + 2 dimensions. Moreover, for z \u2192 0, one has r \u2192 \u221e. Therefore, one can write an expansion for z in inverse powers of r.\n\u2013 31 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 0 5\nTherefore, at leading order one has z = L2r . Moreover, the first non-zero coefficient that is different between the black hole geometry and the vacuum is ad [68]. In the following, we first investigate how the above formula is changed for a HV black brane. Next, we find the connection between rBBmax and rVacmax. Asking for the radial part of the black brane metric in eqs. (2.4) and (A.1) to be equal to each other, one has\ndz z = \u2212 r\n\u03b8e F r\u03b8e+1 \u221a f(r) dr. (A.3)\nIn the following, we consider the two cases \u03b8 = 0 and \u03b8 6= 0, separately.\nA.1 \u03b8 = 0\nFor very large r, one has f(r) \u2248 1, (A.4)\nand hence by taking the integral of eq. (A.3), one obtains\nlog z = \u2212 log r + c\u0303, (A.5)\nor equivalently\nz = L 2\nr . (A.6)\nIt should be pointed out that we choose the integration constant such that at leading order, one has z = L2r (see also [68]). Moreover, to find the subleading corrections to eq. (A.6), one can expand f(r) in powers of r in eq. (A.3) and taking the integrals on both sides. It is straightforward to see that\nz = L 2\nr + a1 rd+z+1 + a2 r2(d+z)+1 + a3 r3(d+z)+1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (A.7)\nTherefore, at z = \u03b4, one can write \u03b4 in terms of rmax as follows\n\u03b4 = L 2\nrmax + a1 rd+z+1max + a2 r 2(d+z)+1 max + a3 r 3(d+z)+1 max + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (A.8)\nNow one can invert the above formula and write rmax in terms of \u03b4\nrmax = L2\n\u03b4 + a\u03031\u03b4d+z\u22121 + a\u03032\u03b42(d+z)\u22121 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (A.9)\nNext, we find the connection between rBBmax and rVacmax. By taking the integral on the left hand side of eq. (A.3), one has\nlog \u03b4 L2\n= log \u222b \u03b4 dz\nz = \u2212 \u222b rmax dr r \u221a f(r) . (A.10)\nIt should be pointed out that one can apply eq. (A.10), both for the black brane and the vacuum geometries. Having this in mind that the radial cutoff \u03b4 in the FG coordinate is the same for both geometries, and subtracting eq. (A.10) for both of them, one obtains\n0 = \u222b rBBmax dr\nr \u221a f(r)\n\u2212 \u222b rVacmax dr\nr . (A.11)\n\u2013 32 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 0 5\nThen, we assume that (see also [68])\nrBBmax = rVacmax + \u03b4 rmax. (A.12)\nBy plugging the above equation into the first integral in eq. (A.11), one can make the following approximation at leading order in \u03b4 and rVacmax\n\u222b rBBmax dr r \u221a f(r) = \u222b rVacmax+\u03b4 rmax dr r \u221a f(r)\n= \u222b rVacmax dr\nr \u221a f(r) + 1 r \u221a f(r) \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 rVacmax+\u03b4 rmax \u03b4 rmax\n= \u222b rVacmax dr\nr \u221a f(r) + 1 rVacmax\n( rBBmax \u2212 rVacmax ) , (A.13)\nwhere we applied eq. (A.12) in the last line. Next, by substituting the above equation into eq. (A.11), one arrives at\n1 rVacmax\n( rBBmax \u2212 rVacmax ) = \u222b rVacmax (\n1\u2212 1\u221a f(r)\n) dr\nr\n= \u2212r d+z h\n2 \u222b rmax dr rd+z+1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n' rd+zh\n2(d+ z) ( 1 rVacmax )d+z + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 .

(A.15)\nNext, we find the connection between rVacmax and \u03b4. From eq.

(A.15), one can write\nrBBmax = L2 \u03b4 + r d+z h 2(d+ z)L2(d+z\u22121) \u03b4d+z\u22121 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (A.18)\nNotice that for z = 1, it reduces to eq. (A.13) in ref. [68] for a planar AdS-Schwarzschild black hole in d+ 2 dimensions as it was expected.\n\u2013 33 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 0 5\nA.2 \u03b8 6= 0\nFor very large r, one again has f(r) \u2248 1, and hence\nlog \u03b4 L2 = 1 \u03b8e ( rF rmax )\u03b8e , (A.19)\nor equivalently, z = L2e 1 \u03b8e ( rF rmax ) . (A.20)\nNotice that form eq. (A.19) for \u03b8 > 0 when rmax \u2192 \u221e, one has \u03b4 \u2192 L2. Moreover, for \u03b8 < 0 when rmax \u2192\u221e, one has \u03b4 \u2192\u221e. These results are not consistent with the fact that for rmax \u2192\u221e, one must have \u03b4 \u2192 0. To remedy the issue, we apply the following ansatz for the metric in the FG coordinate\nds2 = L 2\nz2 ( zF z )\u22122\u03b8e ( dz2 + gij(z, xi)dxidxj ) . (A.21)\nNotice that for \u03b8 = 0, eq.

(A.22), one arrives at\nz\u03b8e = (rF zF )\u03b8e [\n1 r\u03b8e + \u03b8er de+z h 2(de + z + \u03b8e) 1 rde+z+\u03b8e + 3\u03b8er 2(de+z) h 8 ( 2(de + z) + \u03b8e) ) 1 r2(de+z)+\u03b8e\n+ 5\u03b8er 3(de+z) h 16 ( 3(de + z) + \u03b8e) ) 1 r3(de+z)+\u03b8e\n+ \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ] , (A.23)\nwhich can be recast in the following form\nz = L 2\nr + a1 rde+z+1 + a2 r2(de+z)+1 + a3 r3(de+z)+1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (A.24)\nIt should be pointed out that in eq. (A.23) we set the integration constant to zero. Moreover, we assume that zF = L 2\nrF . Therefore, at z = \u03b4, one can write \u03b4 in terms of rmax as follows\n\u03b4 = L 2\nrmax + a1 rde+z+1max + a2 r 2(de+z)+1 max + a3 r 3(de+z)+1 max + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (A.25)\nNow, one can invert the above formula and write rmax in terms of \u03b4 as follows\nrmax = L2\n\u03b4 + a\u03031\u03b4de+z\u22121 + a\u03032\u03b42(de+z)\u22121 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (A.26)\nThen, we find the connection between rBBmax and rVacmax. By taking the integral on the left hand side of eq. (A.22), one has\n1 \u03b8e\n( \u03b4\nzF )\u03b8e = 1 z\u03b8eF \u222b \u03b4 dz z1\u2212\u03b8e = \u2212r\u03b8eF \u222b rmax dr r1+\u03b8e \u221a f(r) . (A.27)\n\u2013 34 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 0 5\nAs mentioned before, the cutoff \u03b4 in the FG coordinate is the same both for the black brane and the vacuum geometries. Therefore, by subtracting eq. (A.27) for both geometries, one obtains\n0 = \u222b rBBmax dr\nr1+\u03b8e \u221a f(r)\n\u2212 \u222b rVacmax dr\nr1+\u03b8e . (A.28)\nNext, by plugging eq. (A.12) into the first integral in eq. (A.28), one can make the following approximation to the integral at leading order in \u03b4 and rVacmax\u222b rBBmax dr\nr1+\u03b8e \u221a f(r)\n= \u222b rVacmax dr\nr1+\u03b8e \u221a f(r)\n+ rmax \u03b4 (\n1 r1+\u03b8e \u221a f(r) )\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 rVacmax+\u03b4 rmax\n= \u222b rVacmax dr\nr1+\u03b8e \u221a f(r) + 1 (rVacmax) 1+\u03b8e\n( rBBmax \u2212 rVacmax ) . (A.29)\nThen, by substituting the above equation into eq. (A.28), and expanding the blackening factor in powers of r, one has\n1 (rVacmax) 1+\u03b8e\n( rBBmax \u2212 rVacmax ) ' \u222b rVacmax (\n1\u2212 1\u221a f(r)\n) dr\nr1+\u03b8e\n= \u2212r de+z h\n2 \u222b rmax dr rde+z+\u03b8e+1 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7\n= r de+z h\n2(de + z + \u03b8e) ( 1 rVacmax )de+z+\u03b8e + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (A.30)\nFrom the above equation, one easily obtains\nrBBmax = rVacmax + rde+zh\n2(de + z + \u03b8e) ( 1 rVacmax )de+z\u22121 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 . (A.31)\nNow, we find the connection between \u03b4 and rVacmax. For the vacuum one has f(r) = 1, and from eq. (A.27), one arrive at\n1 \u03b8e\n( \u03b4\nzF )\u03b8e = 1 z\u03b8eF \u222b \u03b4 dz z1\u2212\u03b8e = \u2212r\u03b8eF \u222b rVacmax dr r1+\u03b8e . (A.32)\nBy taking the integral on the right hand side of the above equation, one finds\n\u03b4 = rF zF rVacmax , (A.33)\nwhere we set the integration constant to zero again. Moreover, by setting zF = L 2\nrF , one can\nrewrite eq. (A.33) as follows\nrVacmax = L2\n\u03b4 . (A.34)\nAt the end, by plugging eq. (A.34) into eq. (A.31), one has\nrBBmax = L2 \u03b4 + r de+z h 2(de + z + \u03b8e)L2(de+z\u22121) \u03b4de+z\u22121 + \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 .

(B.1)\nIn this case, eqs. (3.3) to (3.16) and eqs. (3.18) to (3.24) are still valid. However, one needs to replace the old a(r) in eq. (3.4) with the new one in eq. (B.1). It is also evident that in this case the effective potential is also changed. Since finding the closed form of U\u0302(w) for arbitrary values of d, \u03b8 and z is very complicated, we do not write it down here. However, it is easy to find it for each value of these parameters. In figures 21, 22 and 2327 we plotted numerically the growth rate of Cgen for the following cases, respectively\n\u2022 \u03bb1 6= 0 and \u03bb2,3 = 0\n\u2022 \u03bb2 6= 0 and \u03bb1,3 = 0\n\u2022 \u03bb3 6= 0 and \u03bb1,2 = 0.\n26We would like to thank the referee very much for her/his helpful suggestions to do these calculations. 27In these figure, we set L = rh = rF = GN = Vd = 1.\n\u2013 36 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 1 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 1 0 5\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n\u03c4/\u03b2\ndC ge n d\u03c4\n\u03b8=0 \u03b8=-1 \u03b8=-2 \u03b8=-3 \u03b8=-4\n0.0 0.5 1.0 1.5 0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n\u03c4/\u03b2\ndC ge n d\u03c4\nz=6 z=5 z=4 z=3 z=2 z=1\nFigure 24.

In all figures, it is evident that the growth rate of Cgen at late times is linear in time, if one chooses \u03bb1,2,3 such that U\u0302(w) has a maximum inside the horizon. Therefore, all of the corrections to volume-complexity in eq. (B.1) behave universally at late times.\nOpen Access.
