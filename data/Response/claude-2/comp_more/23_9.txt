 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after reading this paper on scaling offline reinforcement learning:

1. Develop new offline RL algorithms that can scale to even larger and more diverse datasets. The paper shows CQL can scale to 40 Atari games, but we may need new techniques to handle hundreds or thousands of tasks. Areas to explore include new network architectures, regularization methods, and ways to leverage self-supervised pretraining.

2. Apply scaled offline RL to real-world robotics problems. The paper focuses on Atari games, but an important next step is applying these methods to complex robotic control tasks where large offline datasets exist but online data collection is expensive. This can demonstrate the practical value of offline RL.

3. Combine offline RL with online fine-tuning and exploration techniques. The paper shows offline RL can enable fast online fine-tuning, but performance on entirely new games is lacking. Developing principled ways to leverage offline pretraining while still exploring and learning online could improve generalization.

4. Investigate whether scaled offline RL can learn skills and representations that transfer to completely different domains, beyond Atari. For example, can Atari pretraining transfer to robotics? This tests the generality of the learned representations.

5. Study theoretical questions around offline RL scaling laws and generalization bounds. As models become huge, can we characterize their generalization abilities? Connecting empirical scaling trends to theoretical guarantees can provide insight into why and how offline RL generalizes.
