    "abstractText": "Vibrio cholerae is a facultative pathogen that primarily occupies marine environments. In this niche, V. cholerae commonly interacts with the chitinous shells of crustacean zooplankton. As a chitinolytic microbe, V. cholerae degrades insoluble chitin into soluble oligosaccharides. Chitin oligosaccharides serve as both a nutrient source and an environmental cue that induces a strong transcriptional response in V. cholerae. Namely, these oligosaccharides induce the chitin sensor, ChiS, to activate the genes required for chitin utilization and horizontal gene transfer by natural transformation. Thus, interactions with chitin impact the survival and evolution of V. cholerae in marine environments. Chitin is a complex carbon source for V. cholerae to degrade and consume, and the presence of more energetically favorable carbon sources can inhibit chitin utilization. This phenomenon, known as carbon catabolite repression (CCR), is mediated by the glucose-specific Enzyme IIA (EIIAGlc) of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS). In the presence of glucose, EIIAGlc becomes dephosphorylated, which inhibits ChiS transcriptional activity by an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that dephosphorylated EIIAGlc interacts with ChiS. We also isolate ChiS suppressor mutants that evade EIIAGlc-dependent repression and demonstrate that these alleles no longer interact with EIIAGlc. These findings suggest that EIIAGlc must interact with ChiS to exert its repressive effect. Importantly, the ChiS suppressor mutations we isolated also relieve repression of chitin utilization and natural transformation by EIIAGlc, suggesting that CCR of these behaviors is primarily regulated through ChiS. Together, our results reveal how nutrient conditions impact the fitness and evolution of an important human pathogen in its environmental reservoir. INTRODUCTION Vibrio cholerae is a Gram-negative, motile bacterium that primarily inhabits marine environments. When ingested, some serogroups are capable of causing the disease cholera, which is characterized by a profuse secretory diarrhea [1]. The differences between the marine environment and the human gut are profound, and V. cholerae must express distinct sets of genes in order to survive the challenges specific to each niche [2]. In the marine environment, this organism\u2019s expression profile is heavily influenced by contact with chitin, an insoluble polymer of \u03b21,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) that is found in the shells of crustaceans [3]. V. cholerae frequently colonizes and forms biofilms on chitinous surfaces [3, 4]. Chitin oligomers serve as both a nutrient source and an environmental cue that induces the transcription of genes required for efficient chitin catabolism as well as for behaviors that enhance its fitness in this communal setting [3, 5]. These behaviors include chitin utilization itself as well as natural transformation, a mode of horizontal gene transfer in which bacteria take up exogenous DNA and integrate it into their genome via homologous recombination [6]. Natural transformation can promote the spread of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance genes in bacterial pathogens [7]. The chitin response therefore governs both survival and evolution of V. cholerae in marine biofilms. The extracellular degradation of insoluble chitin and uptake of soluble chitin oligosaccharides is energetically costly and dozens of proteins are required for catabolism [8]. In contrast, simple six-carbon sugars (i.e., glucose) can enter glycolysis with minimal modification [9]. It may therefore be advantageous for bacteria to consume simple sugars before expending energy to degrade complex polysaccharides like chitin. This hierarchical consumption of sugars is typically achieved through upregulation of genes required to consume the preferred carbon source, repression of genes and proteins involved in catabolism of less preferred carbon sources, or both. This behavior is known as carbon catabolite repression (CCR) [10, 11]. CCR is primarily mediated through proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS). This system consists of a broadly conserved set of proteins that mediate a phosphorelay that ultimately facilitates the uptake and concomitant phosphorylation of specific carbohydrates [12]. The first protein in the PTS cascade is Enzyme I (EI). This protein autophosphorylates using the glycolytic (which was not certified by peer review) is the author/funder. All rights reserved.

            "text": "Vibrio cholerae is a facultative pathogen that primarily occupies marine environments. In this niche, V. cholerae commonly interacts with the chitinous shells of crustacean zooplankton. As a chitinolytic microbe, V. cholerae degrades insoluble chitin into soluble oligosaccharides. Chitin oligosaccharides serve as both a nutrient source and an environmental cue that induces a strong transcriptional response in V. cholerae. Namely, these oligosaccharides induce the chitin sensor, ChiS, to activate the genes required for chitin utilization and horizontal gene transfer by natural transformation. Thus, interactions with chitin impact the survival and evolution of V. cholerae in marine environments. Chitin is a complex carbon source for V. cholerae to degrade and consume, and the presence of more energetically favorable carbon sources can inhibit chitin utilization. This phenomenon, known as carbon catabolite repression (CCR), is mediated by the glucose-specific Enzyme IIA (EIIAGlc) of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS). In the presence of glucose, EIIAGlc becomes dephosphorylated, which inhibits ChiS transcriptional activity by an unknown mechanism. Here, we show that dephosphorylated EIIAGlc interacts with ChiS. We also isolate ChiS suppressor mutants that evade EIIAGlc-dependent repression and demonstrate that these alleles no longer interact with EIIAGlc. These findings suggest that EIIAGlc must interact with ChiS to exert its repressive effect. Importantly, the ChiS suppressor mutations we isolated also relieve repression of chitin utilization and natural transformation by EIIAGlc, suggesting that CCR of these behaviors is primarily regulated through ChiS. Together, our results reveal how nutrient conditions impact the fitness and evolution of an important human pathogen in its environmental reservoir."

            "heading": "INTRODUCTION",
            "text": "Vibrio cholerae is a Gram-negative, motile bacterium that primarily inhabits marine environments. When ingested, some serogroups are capable of causing the disease cholera, which is characterized by a profuse secretory diarrhea [1]. The differences between the marine environment and the human gut are profound, and V. cholerae must express distinct sets of genes in order to survive the challenges specific to each niche [2]. In the marine environment, this organism\u2019s expression profile is heavily influenced by contact with chitin, an insoluble polymer of \u03b21,4-linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) that is found in the shells of crustaceans [3]. V. cholerae frequently colonizes and forms biofilms on chitinous surfaces [3, 4]. Chitin oligomers serve as both a nutrient source and an environmental cue that induces the transcription of genes required for efficient chitin catabolism as well as for behaviors that enhance its fitness in this communal setting [3, 5]. These behaviors include chitin utilization itself as well as natural transformation, a mode of horizontal gene transfer in which bacteria take up exogenous DNA and integrate it into their genome via homologous recombination [6]. Natural transformation can promote the spread of virulence factors and antibiotic resistance genes in bacterial pathogens [7]. The chitin response therefore governs both survival and evolution of V. cholerae in marine biofilms. The extracellular degradation of insoluble chitin and uptake of soluble chitin oligosaccharides is energetically costly and dozens of proteins are required for catabolism [8]. In contrast, simple six-carbon sugars (i.e., glucose) can enter glycolysis with minimal modification [9]. It may therefore be advantageous for bacteria to consume simple sugars before expending energy to degrade complex polysaccharides like chitin. This hierarchical consumption of sugars is typically achieved through upregulation of genes required to consume the preferred carbon source, repression of genes and proteins involved in catabolism of less preferred carbon sources, or both. This behavior is known as carbon catabolite repression (CCR) [10, 11]. CCR is primarily mediated through proteins of the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase system (PTS). This system consists of a broadly conserved set of proteins that mediate a phosphorelay that ultimately facilitates the uptake and concomitant phosphorylation of specific carbohydrates [12]. The first protein in the PTS cascade is Enzyme I (EI). This protein autophosphorylates using the glycolytic\nintermediate phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) as a substrate [11]. EI then transfers this phosphate to the histidine phosphocarrier protein (Hpr), which in turn transfers the phosphate to the EIIA domain of a sugar permease complex known as Enzyme II (EII). The EIIA domain can then transfer the phosphate to a cognate EIIB domain, which then transfers the phosphate to the carbohydrate substrate during uptake through the EIIC(D) permease. During substrate import, phosphates flow rapidly through the PTS, skewing the intermediate proteins towards their dephosphorylated states. In the absence of substrate, phosphate flow halts, and the intermediates accumulate in their phosphorylated form [11, 13]. Importantly, this phenomenon means that the phosphorylation status of PTS intermediates reflects the availability of their respective substrates [11, 13]. The relationship between the phosphorylation status of PTS proteins and carbohydrate availability is readily exploited by the cell. PTS intermediates perform a host of regulatory functions that enable careful modulation of cellular processes in response to nutrient availability. These functions depend on the phosphorylation state of PTS intermediates. While many PTS proteins have documented regulatory roles, the central mediator of CCR in Gram-negative bacteria is the glucose-specific Enzyme IIA (EIIAGlc), which in V. cholerae is responsible for the import of glucose as well as sucrose, trehalose, and N-acetylglucosamine [11, 14]. Glucose-induced dephosphorylation of EIIAGlc enables its participation in an array of regulatory activities [11]. Regulation by EIIAGlc has been described for behaviors including metabolism [15], virulence [16], motility [17], and biofilm formation [18]. Understanding the different mechanisms underlying EIIAGlc activity is critical to unraveling how these crucial processes are influenced by carbon availability. The V. cholerae chitin response is among the many behaviors regulated by CCR. V. cholerae senses and responds to chitin through the noncanonical hybrid sensor kinase ChiS (chitin sensor) [8]. In the presence of chitin, ChiS activates the transcription of genes required for chitin utilization and natural transformation [8, 19, 20]. However, it has been observed that V. cholerae cells grown on EIIAGlc-dependent sugars cannot undergo chitin-induced natural transformation [21]. Similarly, strains expressing dephospho-EIIAGlc are nontransformable [22]. The mechanism by which EIIAGlc inhibits this important cellular process is unknown, but a recent study has shown that dephospho-EIIAGlc can reduce ChiS-dependent transcriptional activation [22]. This finding raises the possibility that EIIAGlc inhibition of natural transformation may involve repression of ChiS itself. The mechanism by which dephospho-EIIAGlc represses ChiS is unknown, and it is not clear whether such repression contributes to the previously described CCR of natural transformation [21, 22]. As ChiS also activates the genes required for chitin utilization, it is also possible that dephospho-EIIAGlc will prevent efficient growth on chitin, which is critical for Vibrio survival in marine environments [3]. In this study, we identify the molecular mechanism of CCR of natural transformation and chitin utilization in V. cholerae. We find that dephospho-EIIAGlc interacts with ChiS, and that this interaction is required for repression to occur. ChiS suppressor mutations that escape dephospho-EIIAGlc-dependent repression also relieve CCR of chitin utilization and natural transformation. Together, these findings suggest that repression of ChiS by dephospho-EIIAGlc is the dominant mechanism of CCR for chitin-dependent responses in V. cholerae."

            "text": "Dephosphorylated EIIAGlc represses ChiS transcriptional activity and downstream behaviors ChiS activity can be assessed through its direct activation of the chitobiose utilization operon (chb) [8, 23]. In the presence of chitin, ChiS strongly activates this locus, resulting in the transcription of genes required for the uptake and utilization of chitobiose [8]. In the absence of chitin, ChiS is repressed by the periplasmic chitin binding protein (CBP). Previous work has shown that the deletion of CBP is sufficient to genetically activate ChiS even in the absence of chitin [8]. We therefore used a Pchb-GFP transcriptional reporter [24] in a \u2206cbp background to interrogate ChiS activity. Consistent with previous findings [22], we observed that rendering EIIAGlc dephosphorylated by the deletion of its upstream phosphate donor EI fully represses ChiS transcriptional activity (Fig. 1A). This repression can be largely relieved by the simultaneous deletion of EIIAGlc, suggesting that EIIAGlc plays a critical role in this repression (Fig. 1A). We generated a genetically locked dephospho-EIIAGlc allele [25] by mutating the phosphorylated histidine to a glutamate (H91Q) and found that this allele was sufficient to repress ChiS activity in a background where EI was intact (Fig. 1A). Furthermore, a proposed phosphomimetic EIIAGlc H91D allele [18] cannot repress ChiS in a \u2206EI background. All together, these results are consistent with a model in which dephospho-EIIAGlc represses ChiS activity (Fig. 1A). These findings suggested that the phosphorylation status of EIIAGlc is central to its ability to repress ChiS activity. Phosphorylated EIIAGlc stimulates the activity of adenylate cyclase to increase the cellular levels of the second messenger cyclic AMP (cAMP), while dephospho-EIIAGlc cannot promote this activity\n[26],[11],[27, 28]. ChiS-dependent activity requires cAMP, as evidenced by the fact that an adenylate cyclase mutant displays no induction of Pchb unless exogenous cAMP is supplied (Fig. S1A). Because the deletion of EIIAGlc markedly rescues ChiS activity, we reasoned that low cAMP levels were not the primary mechanism for \u2206EI repression of ChiS since \u2206EI \u2206EIIAGlc mutants and \u2206EI mutants both lack phosphorylated EIIAGlc for stimulating adenylate cyclase activity. However, to formally test this, we performed assays in the presence and absence of supplemental cAMP. Consistent with previous reports [22], cAMP is unable to rescue ChiS activity in the \u2206EI or EIIAGlc H91Q backgrounds (Fig. S1A). Thus, EIIAGlc is repressing ChiS activity via a mechanism other than through the indirect regulation of adenylate cyclase activity because cAMP cannot rescue ChiS activity while dephospho-EIIAGlc is present in the cell. Our previous experiments utilized a \u2206cbp mutation to genetically induce ChiS activity in the absence of chitin. So, we next asked whether repression by EIIAGlc affects ChiS transcriptional activity in a more physiologically relevant setting. To test this question, we grew cells containing a Pchb-mCherry reporter [24] on insoluble chitin for 48 hours and assessed fluorescence of individual cells using microscopy. The mCherry signal was normalized to a constitutively expressed GFP construct to account for internal noise in gene expression. Importantly, these strains all had cbp intact, which allows for natural chitin-induced activation of ChiS. As expected, parent cells robustly activated the Pchb-mCherry reporter under these conditions, while cells lacking ChiS did not (Fig. 1B). The \u2206EI mutation fully repressed ChiS activity in this assay (Fig. 1B). This repression could be relieved by the tandem deletion of EIIAGlc (Fig. 1B), mirroring what was observed when the \u2206cbp mutation was used to induce ChiS activity (Fig. 1A). Interestingly, the nonphosphorylatable EIIAGlc H91Q allele only slightly repressed ChiS in this assay (Fig. 1B). This result suggests that EIIAGlc H91Q may be a less potent repressor of ChiS than natural dephospho-EIIAGlc, which is more readily observed when ChiS activity is stimulated via natural chitin induction. The reduced efficacy of the H91Q allele might be explained by the fact that for other targets of EIIAGlc, the H91 residue is part of the protein-protein binding interface [29-32]. Thus, beyond affecting phosphorylation, mutations to this residue may affect the ability of EIIAGlc to interact with its downstream targets, which may include ChiS. Lastly, the phosphomimetic EIIAGlc H91D [18] allele mediated no repression of ChiS in the \u2206EI background (Fig. 1B), further supporting that dephospho-EIIAGlc inhibits ChiS activity. Once again, exogenous addition of cAMP was unable to rescue ChiS activity in the \u2206EI background (Fig. 1B, Fig. S1B). Interestingly, the addition of cAMP did restore Pchb expression in the \u2206EI/EIIAGlc strain back to parent levels of activity (Fig. 1B, Fig. S1B), suggesting that a reduction of cAMP in this background (due to low adenylate cyclase activity in the absence of phosphorylated EIIAGlc) does play a small role in limiting ChiS transcriptional activity. Together, these results support our previous observations and reaffirm that EIIAGlc inhibits ChiS activity in physiologically relevant conditions. Having observed a strong repressive effect on ChiS-dependent transcription, we sought to determine whether EIIAGlc repression impacts ChiS-controlled behaviors. ChiS directly activates the genes required for chitin uptake and catabolism [3, 8, 23]. We therefore asked whether dephospho-EIIAGlc affects the ability of V. cholerae to grow on insoluble chitin over 72 hr. We found that deletion of EI reduced final growth yield to the same level as a ChiS deletion (Fig. 1C). This defect in growth yield was restored in the \u2206EI \u2206EIIAGlc double mutant (Fig. 1C). Growth yield was only partially reduced by EIIAGlc H91Q, which is consistent with the intermediate repression mediated by this allele on chitin-induced ChiS activity. EIIAGlc H91D relieved the repressive effects of the \u2206EI mutation on growth yield. Once again, exogenous cAMP did not alter these outcomes (Fig. 1C, Fig. S2). These results suggest that EIIAGlc-mediated repression of ChiS activity is sufficient to repress the ability of V. cholerae to use insoluble chitin as a carbon source. Apart from regulating chitin utilization, ChiS is also essential for the induction of natural transformation [5, 19, 20], a physiological state in which cells are able to take up extracellular DNA from the environment to incorporate into their genome by homologous recombination [6]. Consistent with previous work, we found that while parent cells transform at a high frequency, transformation is severely impaired in a \u2206EI background [22] (Fig. 1D). However, in contrast with previous work [22], we observed a partial rescue in transformation in the \u2206EI \u2206EIIAGlc double mutant. We attribute this discrepancy to differences in the dynamic ranges of our transformation assays; the reduced transformation frequency of the \u2206EI \u2206EIIAGlc strain likely falls below the limit of detection of the less sensitive assay used to previously test this question. Interestingly, the EIIAGlc H91Q mutant displayed no transformation defect (Fig. 1D). Our findings above indicate that this allele is likely a less effective repressor of ChiS activity compared to natural dephospho-EIIAGlc. Previous work from our lab has also shown that strains that exhibit growth defects on chitin can still transform at high levels, suggesting that the threshold of chitin induction required for cells to transform may be lower than that required for growth on chitin [33]. This may explain why the EIIAGlc H91Q mutant exhibited no transformation defect (Fig. 1D). The phosphomimetic EIIAGlc H91D mutation in the \u2206EI background transformed at parent levels, which further\nsuggests that dephospho-EIIAGlc is required for inhibition of natural transformation in the \u2206EI background (Fig. 1D). As seen in the previous assays, cAMP was unable to restore transformation of the \u2206EI mutant to parent levels (Fig. S3). All together, these results indicate that EIIAGlc greatly impairs ChiS transcriptional activity and downstream behaviors (i.e., growth on chitin and chitin-induced natural transformation), in a cAMPindependent manner.\nDephosphorylated EIIAGlc inhibits ChiS DNA-binding activity Next, we wanted to probe the mechanism by which EIIAGlc represses ChiS activity. ChiS has a DNA-binding domain and directly binds to the chb promoter [23, 34]. Thus, we hypothesized that EIIAGlc might interfere with ChiS DNA-binding. To test this possibility, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-qPCR assays using a previously characterized [23] functional FLAG-tagged construct of ChiS to assess DNA-binding in vivo. We hypothesized that if dephospho-EIIAGlc inhibits DNA binding, ChiS should no longer be able to ChIP the chb promoter; however, if dephospho-EIIAGlc inhibits activation downstream of DNA binding, we should still observe ChiS DNA-binding in a \u2206EI mutant. When we performed this experiment, we observed that ChiS DNA binding is ablated in a \u2206EI mutant but rescued in the \u2206EI \u2206EIIAGlc mutant. These data suggest that dephosphoEIIAGlc inhibits the DNA-binding activity of ChiS (Fig. 2). ChiS interacts with dephosphorylated EIIAGlc. We next sought to determine the mechanism by which dephospho-EIIAGlc represses ChiS DNA-binding activity. EIIAGlc has been shown to regulate many target proteins through protein-protein interactions, in a manner that can either stimulate or inhibit the activity of those interacting partners [15, 29, 35, 36]. We therefore hypothesized that dephospho-EIIAGlc might interact with ChiS to repress its activity. To test whether EIIAGlc and ChiS interact, we assessed whether these proteins colocalized in vivo. Specifically, we generated cells that express a EIIAGlc-mCherry fusion that can still repress ChiS (Fig. S4) and an inducible GFP-tagged construct of ChiS [23], and examined their cellular localization pattern using fluorescence microscopy. We observed that when we did not induce ChiS-GFP, EIIAGlc-mCherry was diffuse throughout the cytoplasm (Fig. 3). When we overexpressed ChiS in cells where EI is intact, EIIAGlc remained diffuse in 90% of cells, while in 10% of cells, ChiS and EIIAGlc formed colocalized foci (Fig. 3). Strikingly, when we deleted EI (rendering all EIIAGlc within the cell dephosphorylated), the percentage of cells containing colocalized ChiS-EIIAGlc foci increased to 90% (Fig. 3). Furthermore, 81% of cells expressing EIIAGlc H91Q displayed colocalizing foci (Fig. 3), further suggesting that dephospho-EIIAGlc interacts with ChiS. Consistent with this hypothesis, only 4% of cells expressing the phosphomimetic EIIAGlc H91D allele in a \u2206EI background display colocalizing foci. Colocalization of proteins in vivo only indicates that they are occupying a similar subcellular site, and cannot independently confirm that they interact. We therefore wanted to test whether the colocalization observed between ChiS and EIIAGlc was the result of an interaction. To this end, we took advantage of the PopZ-linked apical recruitment (POLAR) assay [37]. In this assay, two putative interaction partners \u2013 the \u201cbait\u201d and \u201cprey\u201d - are fluorescently tagged. The bait is also tagged with an H3H4 PopZ oligomerization domain. The H3H4 domain specifically interacts with the PopZ protein from Caulobacter crescentus, which localizes to cell poles when heterologously expressed in other bacterial species [38]. Thus, when PopZ is expressed in cells it relocalizes the bait to the cell poles. If the bait and prey interact, PopZ-dependent relocalization of the bait should cause a concomitant relocalization of the prey to the cell poles. However, if the bait and prey do not interact, PopZ-dependent relocalization of the bait should not alter the localization of the prey. Thus, to test if ChiS and EIIAGlc interact, we generated cells with ChiS-H3H4-msfGFP as the bait and EIIAGlc-mCherry as the prey. In the absence of PopZ, ChiS and EIIAGlc foci localize both to the cell poles and midcell (Fig. 3C). When PopZ is induced, the ChiS bait relocalizes to the cell poles as expected (Fig. 3C). Consistent with ChiS and EIIAGlc interacting, nearly all of the EIIAGlc foci are relocalized to the cell poles when PopZ is induced (Fig. 3C). Together, these results strongly suggest that ChiS and dephospho-EIIAGlc interact. Isolation of ChiS suppressor alleles that cannot be inhibited by dephosphorylated EIIAGlc The genotypes that promote ChiS-EIIAGlc interactions (e.g., \u2206EI and EIIAGlc H91Q) correlate with the genotypes in which EIIAGlc represses ChiS activity (Fig. 1A-D, Fig. 3). We therefore hypothesized that this interaction is required for EIIAGlc to inhibit ChiS. To test this possibility, we took an unbiased approach by isolating ChiS suppressor mutants that can escape EIIAGlc-dependent inhibition and then tested these alleles for their ability to interact with EIIAGlc. To isolate ChiS suppressor mutants, we used error-prone PCR to randomly mutagenize ChiS and introduced these mutated alleles into a \u2206cbp \u2206EI (i.e., dephospho-EIIAGlc) strain containing a previously described Pchb-lacZ reporter [24, 39]. We screened ~5,500 colonies for the recovery of ChiS activity\nas indicated by blue colonies on X-gal plates. Of the suppressor mutations we isolated, two were able to fully rescue ChiS transcriptional activity in a \u2206EI background: W388C and I429T (Fig. 4). Both suppressor alleles rescued transcriptional activity using either \u2206cbp or insoluble chitin to induce ChiS activity in the \u2206EI background (Fig. 4A-B). This rescue was equivalent to that conferred by the deletion of EIIAGlc (\u2206EI \u2206EIIAGlc) (Fig. 4A-B). Furthermore, deleting EIIAGlc did not further increase the activity of these suppressor alleles in the \u2206EI background, implying that the ChiS suppressor mutations and EIIAGlc are epistatic and work via the same pathway (Fig. 4A-B). Consistent with transcriptional activity, dephospho-EIIAGlc failed to inhibit the DNAbinding activity of both ChiS suppressor alleles in vivo (Fig. 2). Importantly, the expression level of both ChiS suppressor mutants is comparable to the WT in a \u2206EI background, suggesting that an increased abundance of ChiS cannot account for the phenotypes observed (Fig. S5). We also tested the ability of CBP to repress both ChiS suppressor alleles. Like native ChiS, ChiSW388C was fully repressed by CBP (Fig. 4A). ChiSI429T had observable activity in the presence of CBP, but its activity was still markedly increased when CBP was deleted (Fig. 4A). This finding suggests that ChiSI429T can still be repressed by CBP, but not as efficiently as native ChiS. Together, these data suggest that the W388C and I429T mutations render ChiS specifically resistant to repression by dephospho-EIIAGlc. Because these suppressor alleles restored ChiS transcriptional activity in the \u2206EI mutant, we next tested whether they also rescue the ChiS-dependent phenotypes of chitin utilization and natural transformation from \u2206EI repression. We found that both suppressor mutations rescued both chitin utilization (Fig. 4C) and natural transformation (Fig. 4D) to the same level as a \u2206EI \u2206EIIAGlc mutant. These data suggest that the repression of these behaviors by the \u2206EI mutation is largely mediated through EIIAGlc-dependent repression of ChiS activity. Furthermore, these outcomes were largely unaffected by the addition of cAMP, suggesting that dephospho-EIIAGlc-dependent repression of ChiS activity is the primary mechanism of CCR in the \u2206EI background (Fig. S2-S3).\nChiS suppressor alleles no longer interact with dephosphorylated EIIAGlc We previously showed that dephospho-EIIAGlc and ChiS colocalize in vivo (Fig. 3). We hypothesized that if EIIAGlc needs to interact with ChiS to inhibit its activity, then the ChiS suppressor mutants would no longer be able to interact with dephospho-EIIAGlc. Indeed, we found that these ChiS suppressor alleles (W388C and I429T) greatly reduced the colocalization of ChiS with dephospho-EIIAGlc when compared to the ChiS parent (Fig. 5A-B). These data strongly indicate that EIIAGlc must interact with ChiS to repress its activity.\nThe ChiSW388C suppressor allele confers resistance to glucose-induced CCR of natural transformation Thus far, we have induced CCR via genetics means (i.e., via use of \u2206EI or EIIAGlc H91Q mutations) to show that dephospho-EIIAGlc inhibits ChiS activity. We next sought to test CCR of ChiS using carbon sources that naturally induce CCR. It was previously shown that glucose inhibits natural transformation in V. cholerae [5, 21]. Because cAMP/CRP are critical for induction of natural transformation in conjunction with the master competence regulator TfoX [40, 41], this inhibition was previously assumed to be due to the reduction of cAMP resulting from the dephosphorylation of EIIAGlc by glucose [40, 41],[42, 43]. We observed that while cAMP does increase transformation in a \u2206EI strain, transformation is increased further by the deletion of EIIAGlc (Fig. S3). Furthermore, deletion of EIIAGlc is sufficient to increase transformation even in the absence of exogenous cAMP (Fig. S3). Therefore, we hypothesized that the dominant mechanism for CCR of natural transformation by glucose is through the repression of ChiS activity by dephospho-EIIAGlc. To test this, we compared the transformation efficiency of a strain with ChiSWT to a strain with ChiSW388C in the presence of glucose to induce CCR. As previously reported, glucose inhibited transformation of our parent strain (i.e., harboring ChiSWT) [5, 21] (Fig. S6A). However, contrary to our initial hypothesis, we found that transformation of ChiSW388C was also inhibited by glucose (Fig. S6A). Furthermore, the exogenous addition of cAMP did not rescue transformation in either strain background when glucose was present (Fig. S6A). This is in contrast to the rescue conferred by exogenous cAMP on the transformation frequency of a mutant lacking adenylate cyclase (Fig. S3). One possible explanation for these results is that catabolism and growth of cells on glucose during these transformation assays inhibits transformation nonspecifically\u2014for example, through dilution of the machinery required for DNA uptake and integration. If this hypothesis is true, other supplemental carbon sources should be similarly repressive\u2014even if they are not imported by the PTS (and therefore, would not activate a canonical CCR response). To test this, we assessed transformation efficiency in the presence of fructose (a PTS sugar that uses a separate EIIA protein), maltose (an ABC transported sugar), and a mixture of glutamate and proline. We found that all carbon sources inhibited the transformation of both ChiSWT and ChiSW388C regardless of whether exogenous cAMP was provided (Fig. S6A). These data suggest that the\ngrowth of cells in the presence of an additional carbon source (whether it can induce CCR or not) confounds our ability to assess the role of CCR in repressing ChiS using natural substrates. We therefore devised a strategy to separate the effects of glucose induction of CCR from its downstream metabolism. Phosphoglucoisomerase (PGI) is responsible for converting glucose-6-phosphate into fructose-6-phosphate during glycolysis. Thus, \u2206PGI mutants can still take up glucose via the PTS but lack the ability to catabolize it (Fig. S7). When we tested the transformation of a \u2206PGI mutant, we found that it maintained the ability to transform. However, this transformation was fully inhibited by glucose in cells with ChiSWT. By contrast, \u2206PGI cells with ChiSW388C were highly transformable (Fig. 6). Once again, these phenotypes were not affected by cAMP (Fig. S6B). These data suggest that glucose uptake causes CCR of natural transformation, and that the dominant mechanism for this repression is via EIIAGlc-dependent inhibition of ChiS activity."

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "In this study, we uncover the molecular mechanism responsible for CCR of chitin-dependent responses in V. cholerae (Fig. 7). We show that dephospho-EIIAGlc interacts with ChiS in vivo to repress its DNA-binding activity, resulting in the inhibition of chitin utilization and natural transformation. These results reveal a novel mechanism by which carbon availability regulates natural competence and illuminate the mechanisms that permit Vibrio cholerae to regulate these critical behaviors in response to nutrient conditions. Given their energetic cost, it is not surprising that both chitin utilization and natural transformation are tightly regulated processes. Multiple regulators have been identified for ChiS alone [8, 24, 39]. The conservation of a pathway for regulation of these behaviors by PTS sugars raises the question of where V. cholerae cells might encounter such sugars while the chitin response is active. In the context of a chitinassociated biofilm, the ability to rapidly inhibit the chitin response to take advantage of favorable carbon sources (perhaps released from decomposing wildlife) might provide a considerable advantage. Alternatively, it is possible that when this pathogen is ingested, the rapid shutdown of the chitin response within the host gut might aid in colonization. PTS-mediated uptake of GlcNAc, the monosaccharide subunit of chitin, should also render EIIAGlc dephosphorylated. Thus, the uptake of GlcNAc liberated via chitinolytic activity, may serve as a negative feedback mechanism to inhibit the chitin response [14]. While it is easy to speculate that glucose inhibits chitin utilization to maximize efficiency in carbon metabolism, the link between carbon availability and natural transformation is less intuitive. In V. cholerae, natural transformation and chitin utilization are inextricably linked due to their activation by ChiS. It is possible that an evolutionary advantage is primarily conferred by the ability to regulate chitin utilization, and that the regulation of natural transformation is a by-product. However, this hypothesis is challenged by data from Haemophilus influenzae, where natural competence is similarly inhibited by favorable sugars [44]. Furthermore, in H. influenzae, V. cholerae, and Bacillus subtilis, the induction of competence coincides with a stressful and nutrient-poor environment [5, 44],[45]. If competence is beneficial to species in stressful environments, the appearance of favorable carbon sources may lessen the need for such a response. On a mechanistic level, this study also expands our understanding of how CCR regulates natural transformation. Work in V. cholerae has attributed CCR of natural transformation solely to the low cAMP levels that result from sugar-induced EIIAGlc dephosphorylation [21]. We observed that while modulation of intracellular cAMP does play a minor role, the EIIAGlc-mediated repression of ChiS activity represents the dominant mechanism for CCR of chitin-induced behaviors in V. cholerae. This finding differs from CCR of natural transformation in H. influenzae, where fructose-mediated repression can be completely relieved by the addition of exogenous cAMP [44]. The additional layer of regulation present in V. cholerae is striking, and as discussed above, may have evolved as a response to the system\u2019s unique mode of competence induction. The direct regulation by EIIAGlc may strengthen the cell\u2019s control over this costly response by rapidly and efficiently preventing its activation in the presence of favorable carbon sources. This study also adds another member to the extensive EIIAGlc regulon. The ability of EIIAGlc to physically interact with diverse binding partners is poorly understood. Contributing an additional binding partner has the potential to help define requirements for regulation by EIIAGlc, thereby expanding our understanding of how this versatile protein controls a number of key biological processes [18, 46-49]. ChiS is a membrane-embedded hybrid sensor kinase. When chitin oligomers enter the periplasm, they trigger a conformational change in ChiS that is transmitted from its periplasmic domain through a transmembrane domain [8, 23]. This transmembrane domain connects to a flexible linker domain known as a HAMP (present in Histidine kinases, Adenylate cyclases, Methyl-accepting proteins, and Phosphatases) domain, which in turn propagates the signal to the cytoplasmic portion of the protein to activate DNA binding [8, 23]. Interestingly, the W388C suppressor mutation is located within the HAMP domain. The I429T\nsuppressor mutation is located directly after the end of the HAMP domain, but before the beginning of the next domain. We hypothesize that these mutations likely confer resistance to repression in one of two ways. First, they may lie at a binding interface between ChiS and EIIAGlc, preventing hydrophobic or electrostatic interactions typically required for effective repression. Or second, they may trigger a conformational change in the downstream domains of the protein such that the true binding interface becomes inaccessible to EIIAGlc. Interestingly, a single mutation within a HAMP domain has previously been shown to constitutively activate the downstream sensor kinase [50]. The ability of single mutations in the HAMP to drastically alter downstream protein conformation may lend support to the latter hypothesis. Regardless of their mechanism of action, these ChiS suppressor alleles were integral to test the importance of EIIAGlc-dependent repression of ChiS activity on CCR of chitin-induced behaviors in V. cholerae. Lastly, our findings also expand our understanding of the mechanisms by which organisms execute CCR. CCR is a widespread mode of gene regulation in diverse bacterial species. Typically, it involves the repression of proteins directly involved in the process being regulated (often permeases or kinases) [11], [29, 31, 49, 51]. In Firmicutes, regulation of transcription factors through protein-protein interactions is also extremely common [52]. However, CCR of transcription factors is less established in Gram-negative organisms [17, 52]. Interestingly, a recent study in Vibrio vulnificus identified a transcription factor that can be activated by a direct interaction with dephospho-EIIAGlc [36]. This result coupled with our findings may suggest that EIIAGlcdependent regulation of transcription factors is conserved in Gram-negative microbes."

Reactions were then outgrown by adding 500 \u00b5L LB broth and shaking at 37\u00b0C for 2 hrs. Reactions were then plated for quantitative culture on both plain LB agar (total viable counts) and LB agar + chloramphenicol (1 \u00b5g/mL) (transformants). Transformation frequency was calculated by dividing the number of transformants by the total viable counts."

For POLAR experiments, strains were supplemented with 0.2% arabinose to induce PBAD-PopZ. Overexpression of ChiS induces a strong cell curving phenotype in Vibrio cholerae for reasons that remain unclear. Because this curvature disrupts polar relocalization and downstream analysis, we deleted the crvA gene, which is required for cell curvature in V. cholerae, for the strain used in this assay [58]. Overnight cultures were washed and resuspended to an OD600 of 0.3 in IO and placed on a glass coverslip beneath a 0.2% IO gelzan pad. Cells were imaged using the Nikon Ti-2 microscope discussed above. GFP and mCherry foci were visualized on Fiji [56] and 100 cells were analyzed per replicate for a total of \u2265300 cells per sample. Heat maps were generated using Fiji and the MicrobeJ plugin [57]. Chromatin Immunoprecipitation Assays ChIP assays were performed almost exactly as previously described [23]. Strains were inoculated from frozen stocks into LB broth and grown rolling overnight at 30\u00b0C. Overnight cultures were diluted into fresh LB to an OD600 of 0.08 and grown for 6 hours at 30\u00b0C rolling. Subcultured cells were then crosslinked with 1% paraformaldehyde for 20 minutes at room temperature with shaking before being quenched with a 1.2 molar excess of Tris for 10 minutes at room temperature shaking. Cells were then washed twice with TBS (25 mM Tris HCl, pH 7.5 and 125 mM NaCl), and cell pellets were stored at -80\u00b0C overnight. Pellets were then resuspended to an OD600 of 50.0 in lysis buffer (1x FastBreak cell lysis reagent (Promega), 50 \u03bcg/mL lysozyme, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM PMSF, and 1x protease inhibitor cocktail; 100x inhibitor cocktail contained the following: 0.07 mg/mL phosphoramidon (Santa Cruz), 0.006 mg/mL bestatin (MPbiomedicals/Fisher Scientific), 1.67 mg/mL AEBSF (Gold Bio), 0.07 mg/mL pepstatin A (DOT Scientific), 0.07 mg/mL E64 (Gold Bio) suspended in DMSO). Lysis reactions were incubated for 20 mins rocking at room temperature and were then sonicated with a Fisherbrand\u2122 Model 705 Sonic Dismembrator 6 times for 10 seconds at 1% amplitude, resting on ice for at least 30 seconds between each sonication (yielding sheared DNA fragments of ~200-300 bp). Sonicated lysates were then centrifuged and diluted 1:5 in IP buffer (50 mM HEPES NaOH pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 1% Triton X-100). A sample of diluted lysate was collected to permit quantification of input DNA (see below). 1 mL of diluted lysate was then incubated with end-over-end mixing at room temperature with Pierce anti-DYKDDDDK magnetic agarose equilibrated in IP buffer. Supernatant was then removed using a magnetic separation rack. The magnetic agarose was then washed twice with IP Buffer for 1 minute, once with Wash Buffer 1 (50 mM HEPES NaOH pH 7.5, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, 500 mM NaCl, and 0.1% SDS) for 5 minutes, once with Wash Buffer 2 (10 mM Tris HCl pH 8.0, 250 mM LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP- 40, and 1% Triton X-100) for 5 minutes, and once with Buffer TE (10 mM tris pH 8.0 and 1 mM\nEDTA) for 1 minute. To elute protein and DNA off the agarose, it was incubated in SDS elution buffer (50 mM Tris HCl pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA, and 1% SDS) for 30 minutes at 65\u00b0C. The supernatant was then separated from beads using a magnetic separation rack, moved to a new tube, and subjected to digestion with 20 \u00b5g Proteinase K in SDS Elution Buffer for 2 hours at 42\u00b0C. Crosslinks were then reserved by incubating samples for 6 hours at 65\u00b0C. Samples were collected following this incubation for quantification of output DNA. DNA within the samples (input and output) was then purified. Input DNA was diluted 1:100 in buffer EB. Quantitative PCR using iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix (Bio-Rad) was then used to measure the abundance of the chb promoter in the output (following immunoprecipitation) relative to the input (prior to immunoprecipitation). A standard curve generated from genomic DNA diluted in buffer EB permitted quantification of chb abundance. Furthermore, chb promoter levels were normalized to levels of a gene that is not bound by ChiS, rpoB, generating a fold enrichment of the chb promoter for each sample."

Samples were boiled for 10 minutes. For visualizing ChiS-FLAG, 4 uL of sample were separated on a 7.5% SDS PAGE gel. For visualizing RpoA as a loading control, 2 uL of sample were separated on a 15% SDS PAGE gel. Following separation, proteins were electrophoretically transferred to a PVDF membrane. Membranes were then blocked for at least 1 hour in 5% milk and then incubated overnight rocking with either rabbit polyclonal \u03b1-FLAG (1:1000, Sigma) or mouse monoclonal \u03b1-RpoA (1:1000, Biolegend). Membranes were then washed and incubated for at least 2 hours with either \u03b1-rabbit or \u03b1-mouse horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (1:10,000). Blots were then washed and probed with Pierce\u2122 ECL Western Blotting Substrate. Blots were imaged with a ProteinSimple FluorChem R system."
