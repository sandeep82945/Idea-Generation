    "abstractText": "A series of 2-(1H-indol-2-yl)-3-acrylonitrile derivatives, 2a\u2013x, 3, 4a\u2013b, 5a\u2013d, 6a\u2013b, and 7, were synthesized as potential antitumor and antimicrobial agents. The structures of the prepared compounds were evaluated based on elemental analysis, IR, 1Hand 13NMR, as well as MS spectra. X-ray crystal analysis of the representative 2-(1H-indol-2-yl)-3-acrylonitrile 2l showed that the acrylonitrile double bond was Z-configured. All compounds were screened at the National Cancer Institute (USA) for their activities against a panel of approximately 60 human tumor cell lines and the relationship between structure and in vitro antitumor activity is discussed. Compounds of interest 2l and 5a\u2013d showed significant growth inhibition potency against various tumor cell lines with the mean midpoint GI50 values of all tests in the range of 0.38\u20137.91 \u03bcM. The prominent compound with remarkable activity (GI50 = 0.0244\u20135.06 \u03bcM) and high potency (TGI = 0.0866\u20130.938 \u03bcM) against some cell lines of leukemia (HL-60(TB)), non-small cell lung cancer (NCI-H522), colon cancer (COLO 205), CNS cancer (SF-539, SNB-75), ovarian cancer ((OVCAR-3), renal cancer (A498, RXF 393), and breast cancer (MDA-MB-468) was 3-[4-(dimethylamino)phenyl]-2-(1-methyl-1H-indol-2-yl)acrylonitrile (5c). Moreover, the selected 2-(1H-indol-2-yl)-3-acrylonitriles 2a\u2013c and 2e\u2013x were evaluated for their antibacterial and antifungal activities against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens as well as Candida albicans. Among them, 2-(1H-indol-2-yl)-3-(1H-pyrrol-2-yl)acrylonitrile (2x) showed the most potent antimicrobial activity and therefore it can be considered as a lead structure for further development of antimicrobial agents. Finally, molecular docking studies as well as drug-likeness and ADME profile prediction were carried out.",

            "text": "Since the indole motif is a key building block of pharmacologically active natural as well as synthetic molecules, there has been increasing interest in the synthesis and biological research of indole derivatives [1\u20135]. The importance of the indole skeleton to date has led to the development of diverse bioactive compounds that have been identified with anti-inflammatory [6,7], antioxidant and cytoprotective [8,9], antidepressant [10], anti-migraine [11], antihypertensive [12], antidiabetic [13,14] or antiviral [15] effects and as antitubercular agents [16]. Moreover, indole derivatives represent a significant source of novel antibacterial agents that may exhibit their biological activity through the inhibition of\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 918. https://doi.org/10.3390/ph16070918 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceuticals\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 918 2 of 35\nefflux pumps, biofilm or filamentous temperature-sensitive protein Z (FtsZ), and methicillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus pyruvate kinase [17\u201322]. Particular attention has been paid to indole-containing compounds with anticancer properties, which exert their activity by affecting numerous biological targets [23\u201325]. For example, the tubulin inhibitors vincristine and vinblastine isolated from Catharanthus roseus are used in the treatment of various cancers [26], whereas dacomitinib is a well-known antitumor agent that blocks the activity of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) [27]. Furthermore, indole derivatives have been identified as potent myeloid cell leukemia1 (Mcl-1) [28] or Pim kinase [29] inhibitors. Antiproliferative effects of the indole-based compounds may also result from the selective inhibition of silent information regular sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) protein, a highly conserved NAD+-dependent deacetylase belonging to the sirtuin family [30], as well as \u03c32 receptors, the expression of which is increased in tumor cells with respect to quiescent cells. The \u03c32 receptor ligands can rapidly internalize into tumor cells and induce apoptosis through multiple pathways [31]. On the other hand, an indolederived histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, panobinostat, has been approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma [32]. Recently, some indole derivatives of ursolic acid have been described as promising DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors with anticancer activity [33]. In addition, 2,3-disubstituted acrylonitriles containing a heteroaromatic core at position 2 of the acrylonitrile moiety have also gained much interest due to their versatile biological activities [34]. These compounds have been shown to possess anti-inflammatory [35], antioxidant [36], antihyperglycemic [37], antiviral [38,39], antimalarial [40] and antimycobacterial [41] properties as well as the ability to inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity [42,43]. More recently, some benzazole acrylonitrile-based compounds I (Figure 1) were found to be active against both Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The antibacterial activity of these compounds is related to the inhibition of penicillin-binding protein (PBP) and/or \u03b2-lactamase enzyme [44].\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 918 2 of 34\nas antitubercular agents [16].

Antiproliferative effects of the indole-based compounds may also result from the selective inhibition of silent information regular sirtuin 1 (SIRT1) protein, a highly conserved NAD+-dependent deacetylase belonging to the sirtuin family [30], as well as \u03c32 receptors, the expression of which is increased in tumor cells with respect to quiescent cells. The \u03c32 receptor ligands can rapidly internalize into tumor cells and induce apoptosis through multiple pathways [31]. On the other hand, an indole-derived histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, panobinostat, has been approved for the treatment of multiple myeloma [32]. Recently, some indole derivatives of ursolic acid have been described as promising DNA topoisomerase II inhibitors with anticancer activity [33]. In addition, 2,3-disubstituted acrylonitriles containing a heteroaromatic core at position 2 of the acrylonitrile moiety have also gained much interest due to their versatile biological activities [34]. These compounds have been shown to possess antiinflammatory [35], antioxidant [36], antihyperglycemic [37], antiviral [38,39], antimalarial [40] and antimycobacterial [41] properties as well as the ability to inhibit acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity [42,43]. More recently, some benzazole acrylonitrilebased compounds I (Figure 1) were found to be active against both Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The antibacterial activity of these compounds is related to the inhibition of penicillin-binding protein (PBP) and/or \u03b2-lactamase enzyme [44].\nOtherwise, several studies have shown the anticancer potential of heteroaryl-acrylonitriles [34]. For example, some acrylonitriles bearing N-substituted benzimidazole II (Figure 1) [45,46], benzotriazole III (Figure 1) [47], or triazolo [4,5-b]pyridine IV (Figure 1) [48] fragment are able to exert antiproliferative effects against tumor cell lines by\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 918 3 of 35\ninteracting with tubulin in the colchicine-binding site. Other heteroaryl-acrylonitrile-based compounds such as 3-aryl-2-(benzimidazol-2-yl)acrylonitriles V (Figure 1) have shown significant interaction with ct-DNA, supporting the fact that their antitumor properties could be the consequence of DNA binding [49]. Meanwhile, some of the compounds obtained in our laboratory, such as 3-aryl-2-(1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)acrylonitriles, have been identified as potential caspase-9 activators, possessing cytotoxic activity against human cancer cell lines. The most active compound, 2-(benzimidazol-2-yl)-3-(5-nitrothiophen-2yl)acrylonitrile (VI), was on average 10- and 3-fold more potent than cisplatin and etoposide, respectively, in inhibiting cancer cell growth [50]. In turn, the antiproliferative activity of N-alkylindole-substituted 2-(pyrid-3-yl)-acrylonitrile VII is probably due to the inhibition of EGFR and VEGFR-2 tyrosine kinases [51], while 2-(indol-3-yl)acrylonitrile (paprotrain) and its analogs have been reported as kinesin-like protein 2 (MKLP-2) inhibitors, which could be valuable tools to treat tumors overexpressing MKLP-2 [52,53]. Despite the importance of indole [23] and acrylonitrile [34] scaffolds in the design and discovery of new anticancer agents, indoles substituted at position 2 with the acrylonitrile group have remained unexplored for their biological activities. In this context, and in connection with a research program on the chemistry and biological activities of 3-aryl-2-heteroaryl-acrylonitriles undertaken in our laboratory years ago [50,54], we considered that 2-(1H-indol-2-yl)acrylonitriles of type A (Figure 1) may act as potential anticancer agents. These compounds were evaluated for their antimicrobial activity against selected microbial species. In addition, to investigate the importance of the acrylonitrile moiety on biological activity, analogs lacking double bonds were prepared. Furthermore, molecular docking techniques were carried out to rationalize the possible mechanism of action of the most active compounds."

It is worth noting that despite various procedures [56], the Knoevenagel reaction is one of the most useful approaches for the preparation of heteroaryl-acrylonitriles [34,57,58]. As described in Scheme 1, 2-(1H-indol-2-yl)acrylonitriles 2a\u2013s were prepared upon treatment of a methanolic solution of 2-(1H-indol-2-yl)acetonitrile (1) and aldehydes with sodium methoxide solution at ambient temperature (method A). In turn, 2-(1H-indol-2yl)-3-acrylonitriles 2t\u2013x were synthesized by reacting acetonitrile 1 with the corresponding aldehydes in ethanol at ambient temperature in the presence of triethylamine as a catalyst (method B). It should be mentioned that 2-(1H-indol-2-yl)-3-acrylonitriles 2a [59\u201363] and 2b [61\u201363] have been previously reported. However, there have been no reports of their biological activities.

According to the data analysis of the one-dose mean graphs, it is clear that low mean growth values represented better inhibition activity (%GI = 100\u2212GP) (values between 0 and 100), while negative values corresponded to lethal activity (values less than 0) (Table 1).\nScheme 3.

According to the data analysis of the one-dose mean graphs, it is clear that low mean growth values represented better inhibition activity (%GI = 100 \u2212 GP) (values between 0 and 100), while negative values corresponded to lethal activity (values less than 0) (Table 1).\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 918 7 of 35\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 918 8 of 35\n7 82.53 MDA-MB-435 (melanoma) 93.95 a Data obtained from NCI-60 DTP human tumor cell line screen [67]; b %GI (growth inhibition percent) = 100 \u2212 GP (growth percent); c negative values mean lethality of the respective cancer cell line.\nThe following can be noted with respect to the mean growth data presented in Table 1 for the tested compounds. In the series of indole-acrylonitriles 2a\u2013p with aromatic substituent R at position 3 of the acrylonitrile moiety, the substituents that gave indisputable anticancer activity were 4- methoxyphenyl (compound 2d), 4-(dimethylamino)phenyl (compound 2l), and 2-naphthyl (compound 2p). The incorporation of the heteroaromatic ring as substituent R at position 3 of the acrylonitrile moiety afforded compounds 2q\u2013x with weak activity. Replacement of the acrylonitrile moiety by imino-acetonitrile led to a dramatic decrease in activity (comparing compounds 2l and 3). Additionally, hydrogenation of the acrylonitrile double bond was associated with very poor activity (compounds 4a\u2013c). The introduction of a methyl substituent (5a\u2013d) into position 1 of the indole ring of the parent structure led to compounds with greater or equivalent activity compared with their acrylonitrile counterparts 2b, 2d, 2l, and 2p. Interestingly, the introduction of an acetyl group into position 1 of the indole ring of the acrylonitrile analogs had a more varied effect on activity than the introduction of a methyl group (comparing compounds 2b with 6a, and 2l with 6b). Moreover, a decrease in activity was observed when a methylsulfonyl group was attached to the nitrogen atom of the indole scaffold (comparing compounds 2l and 7). From the pattern of the mean growth graph it was apparent that compounds 2l and 5a\u2013d exerted significant growth inhibition against various cancer cell lines representing different cancer types. Therefore, these compounds were selected by NCI for a secondary screening at five concentration levels (0.01\u2013100 \u00b5M). Data for the selected indole-acrylonitrile derivatives 2l and 5a\u2013d are recorded in Tables 2 and 3 and Figure 3. The antitumor activity of the tested compounds is reported for each cell line by GI50 value (GI50 = molar concentration of the compound that inhibits 50% net cell growth) and TGI value (TGI = molar concentration of the compound leading to total inhibition). Furthermore, a mean graph midpoint (MG-MID) is depicted for the GI50 parameter, giving the averaged activity parameter over all cell lines.\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 918 9 of 35\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 918 10 of 35\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 918 11 of 35\nFull panel MG-MID b 1.63 >3.74 0.60 0.38 >7.91 a Median value calculated based on the data from the NCI in vitro cytotoxicity screening for each cancer type cell line; b GI50 full panel mean-graph midpoint (MG-MID) is the average GI50 value against all cancer cell lines.\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 918 12 of 35\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 918 10 of 34\nProstate cancer 2.28 0.45 0.48 0.33 0.33 Breast cancer 1.42 0.54 0.43 0.30 16.91 Full panel MG-MID b 1.63 >3.74 0.60 0.38 >7.91 a Median value calculated based on the data from the NCI in vitro cytotoxicity screening for each cancer type cell line; b GI50 full panel mean-graph midpoint (MG-MID) is the average GI50 value against all cancer cell lines.\nFigure 3. Comparison of the mean GI50 values per panel displayed by compounds 2l and 5a\u2013d.\nAs shown in Table 2, indole-acrylonitrile 2l bearing 4-(dimethylamino)phenyl as substituent R was characterized by relatively high inhibitory activity, with GI50 values in the range of 0.228\u22126.6 \u03bcM. In addition, derivative 2l was found to exert a significant cytostatic effect against some cell lines of leukemia (CCRF-CEM, RPMI-8226), lung cancer (HOP-62, HOP-92), colon cancer (COLO 205, HT29), CNS cancer (SF-295, SNB-75, U251), and melanoma (MDA-MB-435), with TGI values between 0.641 and 18.6 \u03bcM. In regard to the effect in the entire panel of tumor cell lines, compound 2l demonstrated pronounced antiproliferative activity with GI50 MG-MID values ranging from 0.66 to 2.28 \u03bcM, especially against leukemia cells (GI50 MG-MID = 0.66 \u03bcM) (Table 3, Figure 3). As expected, N-methyl-substituted analogue 5c showed improved antitumor properties in comparison with its indole-acrylonitrile counterpart 2l (GI50 = 0.0193\u22125.06 \u03bcM vs. 0.228\u22126.6 \u03bcM) (Table 2). In addition, compound 5c exhibited remarkable cytostatic activity at low TGI level < 5.3 \u03bcM towards 12 cancer cell lines, being particularly effective against 9 various cell lines out of 7 subpanels with TGI values in the submicromolar range of 0.0866\u22120.938 \u03bcM. It was observed that non-small cell lung cancer cell line NCI-H522 was the most susceptible cell line with TGI = 0.0866 \u03bcM (Table 2). On the other hand, the highest overall sensitivity to this compound was found for the subpanels of leukemia and colon cancer cell lines, for which GI50 MG-MID values were 0.17 and 0.15 \u03bcM, respectively (Table 3, Figure 3). Notably, compared with its counterpart 2l, derivative 5c was 3\u22129-fold more potent in individual subpanels of cancer cell lines (GI50 MG-MID = 0.15\u22120.56 \u03bcM vs. GI50 MG-MID = 0.66\u22122.28 \u03bcM) (Table 3, Figure 3).\n0\n5\n10\n15\n20\n25\n2l 5a 5b 5c 5d\nLuekemia\nNon-small cell lung\nColon cancer\nCNS cancer\nMelanoma\nOvarian cancer\nRenal cancer\nProstate cancer\nBreast cancer\nFigure 3.

In addition, derivative 2l was found to exert a significant cytostatic effect against some cell lines of leukemia (CCRF-CEM, RPMI-8226), lung cancer (HOP-62, HOP-92), colon cancer (COLO 205, HT29), CNS cancer (SF-295, SNB-75, U251), and melanoma (MDA-MB-435), with TGI values between 0.641 and 18.6 \u00b5M. In regard to the effect in the entire panel of tumor cell lines, compound 2l demonstrated pronounced antiproliferative activity with GI50 MG-MID values ranging from 0.66 to 2.28 \u00b5M, especially against leukemia cells (GI50 MG-MID = 0.66 \u00b5M) (Table 3, Figure 3). As expected, N-methyl-substituted analogue 5c showed improved antitumor properties in comparison with its indole-acrylonitrile counterpart 2l (GI50 = 0.0193\u20135.06 \u00b5M vs. 0.228\u20136.6 \u00b5M) (Table 2). In addition, compound 5c exhibited remarkable cytostatic activity at low TGI level < 5.3 \u00b5M towards 12 cancer cell lines, being particularly effective against 9 various cell lines out of 7 subpanels with TGI values in the submicromolar range of 0.0866\u20130.938 \u00b5M. It was observed that non-small cell lung cancer cell line NCI-H522 was the most susceptible cell line with TGI = 0.0866 \u00b5M (Table 2). On the other hand, the highest overall sensitivity to this compound was found for the subpanels of leukemia and colon cancer cell lines, for which GI50 MG-MID values were 0.17 and 0.15 \u00b5M, respectively (Table 3, Figure 3). Notably, compared with its counterpart 2l, derivative 5c was 3\u20139-fold more potent in individual subpanels of cancer cell lines (GI50 MG-MID = 0.15\u20130.56 \u00b5M vs. GI50 MG-MID = 0.66\u20132.28 \u00b5M) (Table 3, Figure 3). Moreover, N-methyl-substituted compound 5b with 4-methoxyphenyl as substituent R also demonstrated significant antitumor activity against all of the tested cell lines, with GI50 values ranging from 0.153 to 6.96 \u00b5M (Table 2). It is worth noting that derivative 5b acted as a potent inhibitor against 18 human tumor cell lines of 8 subpanels, with calculated TGI values in the range of 0.403\u201321.3 \u00b5M. Submicromolar TGI values were found for HL-60(TB) and SR leukemia (TGI = 0.582 and 0.94 \u00b5M, respectively), NCI-H522 non-small cell lung cancer (TGI = 0.554 \u00b5M), SNB-75 CNS cancer (TGI = 0.514 \u00b5M), MDMMB-435 melanoma (TGI = 0.403 \u00b5M), OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer (TGI = 0.955 \u00b5M), A498 and RXF 393 renal cancer (TGI = 0.867 and 0.751 \u00b5M, respectively), and MDA-MB-468 breast cancer (TGI = 0.826 \u00b5M) cell lines (Table 2). Nevertheless, concerning overall activity, it should be noted that compound 5b proved to be slightly less potent than derivative 5c (GI50 MG-MID = 0.29\u20131.17 \u00b5M vs. 0.15\u20130.56 \u00b5M) (Table 3, Figure 3). A further decrease in potency was observed when 4-(dimethylamino)phenyl as substituent R in compound\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 918 13 of 35\n5c was replaced with 4-methylphenyl moiety in analogue 5a (GI50 = 0.0193\u20135.06 \u00b5M vs. 0.0726\u2013100 \u00b5M and GI50 MG-MID = 0.15\u20130.56 \u00b5M vs. 0.35\u201316.98 \u00b5M) (Tables 2 and 3, Figure 3). However, the latter derivative still retained pronounced growth inhibitory properties especially against certain cell lines, including HL-60(TB) leukemia, NCI-H522 nonsmall cell lung cancer, SF-295 and SF-539 CNS cancer, MDA-MB-435 melanoma, OVCAR-3 ovarian cancer, A498 renal cancer, and BT-549 breast cancer, with TGI values in the range of 0.254\u20137.12 \u00b5M (Table 2). Another modification of 5c, consisting of replacement of 4-(dimethylamino)phenyl as substituent R at position 3 of the acrylonitrile moiety with a 2-naphthyl group, resulted in compound 5d, which generally exhibited higher activity than 5c against cell lines from the non-small cell lung cancer and CNS cancer subpanels (GI50 MG-MID = 0.24 and 0.11 \u00b5M vs. 0.89 and 0.47 \u00b5M, respectively) (Table 3, Figure 3). In addition, compound 5d acted selectively as a potent inhibitor against HL-60(TB) leukemia (GI50 = 0.179 \u00b5M, TGI = 0.703 \u00b5M), SF-539 CNS cancer (GI50 = 0.0613 \u00b5M, TGI = 0.552 \u00b5M), MDA-MB-435 melanoma (GI50 = 0.0318 \u00b5M, TGI = 0.103 \u00b5M), and A498 renal cancer (GI50 = 0.03 \u00b5M, TGI = 0.418 \u00b5M) cell lines (Table 2). On the other hand, taking into account overall potency, compound 5d proved to be the least active in this series (full panel GI50 MG-MID > 7.91 \u00b5M) (Table 3). From these results it was concluded that the combination of the N-methyl group in the indole ring with the 4-dimethylaminophenyl group at position 3 of the acrylonitrile moiety resulted in derivative 5c with optimal properties (full panel GI50 MD-MIG = 0.38 \u00b5M vs. 0.60\u20137.91 \u00b5M) (Table 3).\n2.2.2. Antimicrobial Activity against Reference Microbial Strains\nThe synthesized indole-acrylonitriles 2a\u2013c and 2e\u2013x were evaluated for their in vitro antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive bacteria (MSSA Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, American Type Culture Collection, USA, Staphylococcus epidermis PMC 2118, Polish Collection of Microorganisms, Poland, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 11420), Gram-negative bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 11229, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442), as well as a fungal species (Candida albicans ATCC 10231). The tests were performed using a serial dilution method, allowing the determination of the minimal concentration inhibiting bacterial growth (MIC), minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC), and minimal fungicidal concentration (MFC). The obtained results are presented in Table 4. Most of the investigated compounds showed no or negligible antimicrobial activity; their MIC, MBC, and MFC values were between \u2265128 and \u2265256 \u00b5g/mL. On the other hand, in the series of indole-acrylonitriles 2a\u2013p with aromatic substituent R in position 3 of the acrylonitrile moiety, 3-chlorophenyl derivative 2i was characterized by relatively high antibacterial activity against Gram-positive bacteria S. aureus ATCC 6538 and S. epidermis PMC 2118, with MIC and MBC values ranging from 8 to 16 \u00b5g/mL (Table 4). Interestingly, replacement of the 3-chlorophenyl group in 2i for either 2-chlorophenyl (compound 2h) or 4-chlorophenyl (compound 2j) resulted in a severe reduction in activity (MIC = 128\u2013256 \u00b5g/mL, MBC/MFC \u2265 256 \u00b5g/mL, Table 4). In turn, indole-acrylonitrile 2n bearing 4-nitrophenyl as substituent R exhibited moderate bacteriostatic activity against S. aureus ATCC 6538 (MIC = 64 \u00b5g/mL), while its bactericidal effect against this strain was weak (MBC = 128 \u00b5g/mL, Table 4). In the series of heteroaromatic analogs 2q\u2013x, promising antimicrobial activity against some bacterial species was demonstrated by compounds 2q, 2s, and 2x (Table 4). Thus, derivative 2q containing pyridine as substituent R in position 3 of the acrylonitrile moiety was found to have pronounced potential against two bacterial Gram-positive strains: S. aureus ATCC 6538 and S. epidermis PMC 2118. The MIC and MBC values obtained for this compound against both strains were 8 and 16 \u00b5g/mL, respectively (Table 4). Changing the pyridine ring of 2q to a thiazole (compound 2s) led to a slight decrease in activity against the same bacterial strains (MIC = 16\u201332 \u00b5g/mL, MBC = 32 \u00b5g/mL) (Table 4). Otherwise, thiazole derivative 2s displayed significant antifungal activity against C. albicans\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 918 14 of 35\nwith an MIC value of 16 \u00b5g/mL (Table 4). However, the highest activity among all the tested compounds was exhibited by 3-pyrole derivative 2x. Thus, compound 2x displayed relatively high antibacterial potency against all Gram-positive bacteria tested, with MIC values in the range of 8\u201332 \u00b5g/mL and MBC values of 32 \u00b5g/mL. Furthermore, it was the only compound that was found to be effective against Gram-negative bacteria, presenting antibacterial activity against E. coli with MIC and MBC values of 32 \u00b5g/mL. In addition, 3-pyrole derivative 2x was characterized by great antifungal activity against C. albicans, with MIC and MFC values of 4 and 8 \u00b5g/mL, respectively (Table 4).\nIt is notable that despite testing a large number of compounds, it was not possible to derive a relationship between structure and activity in the studied series of indoleacrylonitrile derivatives 2a\u2013c and 2e\u2013x. On the other hand, compounds 2i, 2q, 2s, and 2x with interesting antimicrobial activity did not exhibit antitumor effects against the tested cancer cell lines.\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 918 15 of 35\n2.2.3. Antibacterial Activity against Clinical Staphylococcus Aureus Strains\nThe most pronounced compounds 2i, 2q, 2s, and 2x were further evaluated for their bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities against a panel of clinical isolates of Staphylococcus aureus (79, 124, 128, 143, 177, 220 and 244) derived from various human infections. The MIC and MBC values of the tested compounds are shown in Table 5.\nAs revealed by the data in Table 5, indole-acrylonitriles 2i, 2q, and 2s were inactive against the tested Staphylococcus aureus strains isolated from clinical specimens; their MIC and MBC values were between >128 and >256 \u00b5g/mL. On the other hand, satisfactory MIC and MBC values were obtained for compound 2x. It was shown that this compound had ability to inhibit the growth of the clinical isolates at a low concentration of 16 \u00b5g/mL. In addition, indole-acrylonitrile 2x was characterized by relatively strong or moderate bactericidal activity, with MBC values of 32 and 64 \u00b5g/mL. Further studies also indicated relatively high and moderate bactericidal activities of compound 2x against both clinical methicillin-resistant and -sensitive Staphylococcus aureus strains (MRSA 1\u20135, MSSA 6\u201310), with MIC and MBC values of 16 and 64 \u00b5g/mL, respectively (Table 6). It should be noted that both MRSA and MSSA strains exhibited similar sensitivity to the tested compound 2x, while MRSA strains are generally more resistant to antibiotics and antimicrobial compounds than MSSA strains [68].\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 918 16 of 35"

            "text": "2.3.1. Docking to Anticancer Targets\nIn order to rationalize the experimentally assessed antiproliferative properties of the synthesized compounds against cancer cell lines, computational analysis was undertaken. As mentioned above, heteroaryl-acrylonitriles can exhibit antiproliferative effects by inhibiting tubulin polymerization due to their ability to bind to the colchicine-binding site [45\u201348]. Although some synthetic compounds that bind to the colchicine site have been evaluated in clinical trials [69], none have been approved for cancer therapy to date. Therefore, this binding site still offers challenging opportunities for drug development [70]. The caspase signaling pathway has also generated considerable attention as a promising cancer therapeutic strategy [71]. Previously our research group identified a series of 3-aryl-2-(1H-benzimidazol-2-yl)acrylonitriles as potential caspase-3 and -9 activators with cancer cell growth inhibitory properties [50]. On the basis of these results, we considered the induction of the activity of apoptotic enzymes such as caspase-3 and -9. With the above in mind, molecular docking studies of the obtained series of compounds were performed in the binding pockets of the following proteins: caspase-3, caspase-9, and tubulin (PDB codes: 2xyp [72], 2ar9 [73], and 5eyp [74], respectively). From the obtained FRED Chemgauss4 scores (Table S1, Supplementary Materials), it was concluded that most of the proposed ligands exhibited significant affinity to caspase-3, including the active derivatives 2l, 5c, and 5d (Chemgauss4 scores ranging from \u22125.32 to \u22126.09 for the top ranked poses). Furthermore, the active compounds 2l and 5d were ranked relatively high for the caspase-9 binding pocket (Chemgauss4 scores of \u22123.57 and \u22123.05, respectively). On the other hand, the potent analogs 5a\u2013c as well as 5d were characterized by relatively high affinity for the tubulin binding pocket (Chemgauss4 scores ranging from \u221211.53 to \u221213.30). The highest ranked poses of the most potent compound 5c docked in the target proteins are presented in Figure 4, while 2D diagrams of the interactions of the active derivatives 2l and 5a\u2013d can be found in the Supplementary Materials (Tables S2\u2013S4). As shown in Figure 4A, in the binding site of caspase-3, the aromatic rings of ligand 5c made hydrophobic contacts with the Met61 and Cys163 residues present in the p17 subunit as well as Arg207 in the p12 subunit. Side chains of His121 and Tyr204 from p17 and p12, respectively, formed \u03c0-\u03c0 stacking interactions with the ligand core. Van der Waals forces were created with Thr64, Gly122, Glu123, and Phe128 in p17 as well as Tyr204, Ser205, Trp206, and Arg207 in p12. In the case of caspase-9 (Figure 4B), van der Waals interactions were formed between ligand 5c and Thr181, Asp356, Trp362, Gly395, Ile396, and Tyr397. The NH group from the main chain of Arg355 formed a hydrogen bond with a length of 2.6 A with a nitrile nitrogen atom of 5c. Hydrophobic contacts between the ligand and Trp354 as well as Pro357 were also found. According to Figure 4C, ligand 5c created van der Waals interactions with Gln11, Asn101, Ser178, Thr179, Tyr224, and Asn249 from \u03b1-tubulin as well as Leu248, Ala250, Lys254, Leu255, Asn258, Thr314, Val315, and Asn350 from \u03b2-tubulin in the colchicinebinding site of tubulin. Hydrophobic contacts were formed with Ala180 and Val181 from \u03b1-tubulin as well as Met259, Ala316, and Lys352 from \u03b2-tubulin. Glu183 from \u03b1-tubulin interacted via anion-\u03c0 contact.\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 918 17 of 35Ph rmaceuticals 2023, 16, 918 15 of 34\nFigure 4.

Bulky substituents were not allowed on the indole nitrogen atom, since only compounds without a substitue t (2l) or bearing a methyl group (5a\u2013d) presented pronou ced activity. For a more beneficia effect, the additional pendant a atic ring s ould be 2- aphthyl or para-substituted phenyl. Especially advantageous was the introduction of a dimethylamine moiety, which was consistent with literature data [45,46].\n2.3.2. Docking to Antibacterial Targets\nThe antibacterial activity of the acrylonitrile-based compounds could be potentially associated with their affinity to bacterial enzymes involved in the synthesis of peptidoglycan, which is the major component of bacterial cell walls, i.e., penicillin-binding protein 4 (PBP4) and/or \u03b2-lactamase [44]. Thus, the novel ligands were docked in the active sites of the aforementioned proteins from E. coli (PDB codes 2ex8 [75] and 1fqg [76], respectively).\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 918 18 of 35\nAs revealed by the FRED Chemgauss4 scores (Table S1, Supplementary Materials), some of the ligands were ranked higher than the original ligand in the crystal structures, penicillin G. For example, the active derivatives 2i and 2x were bound more strongly in the PBP4 active site than benzylpenicillin (\u22125.90 and \u22126.00 vs. \u22125.66, respectively). In the \u03b2-lactamase-binding pocket, the ligand 2i also achieved a greater score than the original ligand (\u22129.63 vs. \u22129.55), while the most potent ligand 2x was ranked lower than penicillin G with Chemgauss4 score of \u22127.75. The molecular structure of the most active derivative 2x docked in the active pockets of the analyzed proteins is presented in Figure 5, while the 2D diagrams of interactions are included in Supplementary Materials (Tables S5 and S6).\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 918 16 of 34 According to Figure 4C, ligand 5c created van der Waals interactions with Gln11, Asn101, Ser178, Thr179, Tyr224, and Asn249 from \u03b1-tubulin as well as Leu248, Ala250, Lys254, Leu255, Asn258, Thr314, Val315, and Asn350 from \u03b2-tubulin in the colchicinebinding site of tubulin. Hydrophobic contacts were formed with Ala180 and Val181 from \u03b1-tubulin as well as Met259, Ala316, and Lys352 from \u03b2-tubulin. Glu183 from \u03b1-tubulin interacted via anion-\u03c0 contact.

In the \u03b2-lactamase-binding pocket, the ligand 2i also achieved a greater score than the original ligand (\u22129.63 vs. \u22129.55), while the most potent ligand 2x was ranked lower than penicillin G with Chemgauss4 score of \u22127.75. The molecular structure of the most active derivative 2x docked in the active pockets of t e analyzed proteins is presented in Figure 5, while the 2D diagrams of interactions are included in Supplementary Materials (Tables S5 and S6).\nWithin PBP4 (Figure 5A), van der Waals interactions were formed between ligand 2x and Ser62, Phe160, Ser306, Arg361, Ser398, Arg402, Thr418, Leu421, Gln422, and Arg459. The indole NH group of the ligand created a hydrogen bond with a length of 1.6 A with the oxygen atom of the carboxyl group from the main chain of Ser420. However, the hydroxyl group present in the side chain of this amino acid residue formed an unfavorable hydrogen donor\u2013donor type interaction with the NH group of the pyrrole ring present within the ligand structure (length of 1.7 A).\nFigure 5.

Another hydrogen bond was created between the nitrile nitrogen atom and the Asp170 residue (3.0 A).

Evaluation of In Vitro Antiproliferative Activity\nThe in vitro anticancer assay was conducted at the National Cancer Institute (NCI) in Bethesda, USA against approximately 60 cancer cell lines [64\u201367]. The one-dose data were reported as a mean graph of the percent growth of treated cells. The number reported for the one-dose assay was the growth relative to the no-drug control and relative to the number of cells at time zero. This allowed detection of both growth inhibition (values between 0 and 100) and lethality (values less than 0). For example, a value of 100 meant no growth inhibition. A value of 40 would mean 60% growth inhibition. A value of 0 meant no net growth over the course of the experiment. A value of \u221240 would mean 40% lethality. A value of \u2212100 meant all cells were dead. The human tumor cell lines of the cancer screening panel were grown in RPMI 1640 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum and 2 mM L-glutamine. For a typical screening experiment, 100 \u00b5L of cells was inoculated into 96-well microtiter plates at plating densities ranging from 5000 to 40,000 cells/well depending on the doubling time of the individual cell lines. After cell inoculation, the microtiter plates were incubated at 37 \u25e6C, under 5% CO2 and 95% air, and 100% relative humidity for 24 h prior to the addition of the tested compounds. After 24 h, two plates of each cell line were fixed in situ with TCA to represent a measurement of the cell population for each cell line at the time of sample addition (Tz). The tested compounds were solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide at 400-fold the desired final maximum test concentration and stored frozen prior to use. At the time of compound addition, an aliquot of frozen concentrate was thawed and diluted to twice the desired final maximum test concentration with complete medium containing 50 \u00b5g/mL gentamicin. Additional 4-fold, 10-fold, or 12 log serial dilutions were made to provide a total of five compound concentrations plus the control. Aliquots of 100 \u00b5L of these different compound dilutions were added to the appropriate microtiter wells already containing 100 \u00b5L of medium, resulting in the required final compound concentrations. Following compound addition, the plates were incubated for an additional 48 h at 37 \u25e6C, under 5% CO2 and 95% air, and 100% relative humidity. For adherent cells, the assay was terminated by the addition of cold TCA. Cells were fixed in situ by the gentle addition of 50 \u00b5L of cold 50% (w/v) TCA (final concentration, 10% TCA) and incubated for 60 min at 4 \u25e6C. The\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 918 29 of 35\nsupernatant was discarded, and the plates were washed five times with tap water and air dried. Sulforhodamine B (SRB) solution (100 \u00b5L) at 0.4% (w/v) in 1% acetic acid was added to each well, and plates were incubated for 10 min at room temperature. After staining, unbound dye was removed by washing five times with 1% acetic acid and the plates were air dried. Bound stain was subsequently solubilized with 10 mM Trizma Base, and the absorbance was measured using an automated plate reader at a wavelength of 515 nm. For cells in suspension, the methodology was the same except that the assay was terminated by fixing the settled cells at the bottom of the wells by gently adding 50 \u00b5L of 80% TCA (final concentration, 16% TCA). Using seven absorbance measurements [time zero, (Tz), control growth, (C), and growth in the presence of a test compound at five concentration levels (Ti)], the percentage growth was calculated at each of the drug concentration levels. Percentage growth was calculated as:\n[(Ti \u2212 Tz)/(C \u2212 Tz)] \u00d7 100 for concentrations for which Ti >/= Tz\n[(Ti \u2212 Tz)/Tz] \u00d7 100 for concentrations for which Ti < Tz\nThree dose\u2013response parameters were calculated for each tested compound. Growth inhibition of 50% (GI50) was calculated from [(Ti \u2212 Tz)/(C \u2212 Tz)] \u00d7 100 = 50, which refers to the compound concentration resulting in 50% reduction in the net protein increase (as measured by SRB staining) in control cells during the compound incubation. The compound concentration resulting in total growth inhibition (TGI) was calculated from Ti = Tz. The LC50 (concentration of compound resulting in 50% reduction in the measured protein at the end of the drug treatment as compared to that at the beginning) indicating a net loss of cells following treatment was calculated from [(Ti \u2212 Tz)/Tz] \u00d7 100 = \u221250. Values were calculated for each of these three parameters if the level of activity was reached; however, if the effect was not reached or was exceeded, the value for that parameter was expressed as greater or less than the maximum or minimum concentration tested. Furthermore, a mean graph midpoint (MG-MID) was calculated for each of the mentioned parameters, giving an averaged activity parameter over all cell lines. For calculation of the MG-MID, insensitive cell lines were included with the highest concentration tested.\n3.2.2. In Vitro Antimicrobial Activity\nAntimicrobial activity was tested using the following reference strains: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538, Staphylococcus epidermidis PCM 2118, Escherichia coli ATCC 11229, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 15442, Enterococcus faecalis ATCC 11420, and Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Antibacterial activity of selected compounds (2i, 2q, 2s, and 2x) was evaluated against clinical S. aureus strains isolated from various clinical samples (nasal mucus, saliva, sputum, pus, and blood) derived from the Department of Oral Microbiology collection. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for tested compounds were determined using a broth dilution method as recommended by the Clinical Laboratory Standards Institute (CLSI) guidelines [83]. Polypropylene 96-well plates with the investigated compounds serially diluted in Mueller Hinton Broth 2 (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA) (or in Sabouraud Dextrose Broth (BD Difco) for C. albicans) and initial inoculum 5 \u00d7 105 CFU/mL were incubated at 37 \u25e6C for 18 h (or 24\u201348 h for C. albicans). MIC was taken as the lowest compound concentration at which observable growth was inhibited. Minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) was determined in a sample taken from each test tube in which no growth was observed in the MIC assay. A loopful (10 \u00b5L) of the tested sample was transferred to Tryptic Soy Agar (TSA, BD Difco) (or Sabouraud Dextrose Agar (Sigma-Aldrich) for C. albicans) and incubated at 37 \u25e6C for 48 h. MBC was taken as the lowest concentration of tested compound that resulted in more than 99.9% reduction of the initial inoculum. Solutions of compounds were made fresh on the day of the assay. All experiments were performed in triplicate. The reference strains were stored at \u221280 \u25e6C in Tryptic Soy Broth (TSB, Oxoid, England) supplemented with 15% glycerol.\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 918 30 of 35"

            "text": "A series of 2-(1H-indol-2-yl)-3-acrylonitriles 2a\u2013x and their derivatives 3, 4a\u2013c, 5a\u2013d, 6a\u2013b, and 7 were synthesized and evaluated in terms of their anticancer and antimicrobial properties. Analysis of the structure\u2013activity relationship for the antiproliferative activity of all of the prepared compounds against a panel of approximately 60 human cancer cell lines revealed that heterocyclic replacement of the aromatic ring at position 3 of the acrylonitrile moiety led to a strong decrease in activity. The acrylonitrile moiety was required for cell growth inhibition because either replacing this moiety with an imino-acetonitrile group or its saturation yielded compounds with poor or lacking activity. Otherwise, the introduction of a methyl group at position 1 of the 2-(1H-indol-2-yl)-3-acrylonitrile scaffold improved antitumor potency. The 2-(1H-indol-2-yl)-3-acrylonitriles 2l and 5a\u2013d were the most potent of all tested derivatives, exhibiting significant activity against the tumor cell lines investigated (full panel GI50 MD-MIG = 0.38\u20137.91 \u00b5M). Particularly, compound 5c bearing a methyl group at position 1 of the indole ring and a 4-(dimethylamino)phenyl group at position 3 of the acrylonitrile moiety demonstrated optimal properties (full panel GI50 MD-MIG = 0.38 \u00b5M and TGI = 0.0866\u20135.06 \u00b5M against 13 cell lines of different cancer subpanels) and therefore may serve as a useful scaffold for further development of more potent antitumor agents. Moreover, 2-(1H-indol-2-yl)-3-acrylonitriles 2a\u2013c and 2e\u2013x were tested against Grampositive and Gram-negative bacterial strains, namely Staphylococcus aureus, Staphylococcus\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 918 31 of 35\nepidermi, Enterococcus faecalis, Escherichia coli, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa, as well as fungal species Candida albicans. The majority of the tested 2-(1H-indol-2-yl)-3-acrylonitriles were found to be rather inactive; however, compounds 2i, 2q, 2s, and 2x showed promising potential against some bacterial species. An interesting compound is 2-(1H-indol-2-yl)3-(1H-pyrrol-2-yl)acrylonitrile (2x), which exhibited relatively high antibacterial activity against all Gram-positive bacteria tested (MIC = 8\u201332 \u00b5g/mL, MBC = 32 \u00b5g/mL). Furthermore, it was the only compound among those tested that showed activity against Gram-negative bacteria, e.g., E. coli (MIC = MBC = 32 \u00b5g/mL). The analogue 2x also effectively inhibited the growth of various strains of S. aureus isolated from clinical specimens (MIC values of 16 \u00b5g/mL). In addition, derivative 2x was found to have pronounced antifungal activity against C. albicans (MIC = 4 \u00b5g/mL, MFC = 8 \u00b5g/mL). Based on these findings, compound 2x seems to be leading compound for further development as an antimicrobial agent. The results of the docking studies suggested that, like other heteroaryl-acrylonitriles, the obtained compounds may exert their cancer cell growth inhibitory effects through interaction with tubulin in the colchicine-binding site and/or apoptotic caspase-3 as well as caspase-9, whereas their antibacterial activity may be related to interaction with PBP4 and/or \u03b2-lactamase. However, it is too early to speculate on the mode of action of these indole-acrylonitriles. For example, a number of mechanisms could be responsible for their antitumor effects, e.g., specific interaction with cellular receptors and enzymes or 1,4-nucleophilic addition of thiol to the acrylonitrile double bond [49,50]. As Michael acceptors, acrylonitriles react in vitro or in vivo with sulfur-containing nucleophiles such as glutathione (GSH) and proteins. It is worth noting that acrylonitrile-based Michael acceptors activated by aryl or heteroaryl electron-withdrawing groups have been reported as reversible, cysteine-targeted kinase inhibitors [91]. It is well known that such covalent, electrophilic \u201cwarheads\u201d targeting cysteine residues constitute a promising approach in drug development [92]. Therefore, it remains a challenge to explore in depth the mode of action and the pharmacodynamic features of these compounds, which will be the next goal of this project. According to the predicted ADME/drug-likeness properties, the most active compounds 2l, 2x, and 5a\u2013d were shown to be drug-likeness molecules.\nSupplementary Materials: CCDC 2130049 contains the supplementary crystallographic data for this paper.
