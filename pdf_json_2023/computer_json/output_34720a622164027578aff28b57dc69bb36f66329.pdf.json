            "text": "Corrigendum\nThe connectedness proof given here is not valid. A corrected proof can be found in Hannah Blocher, Georg Schollmeyer, Malte Nalenz, and Christoph Jansen (2023): Comparing Machine Learning Algorithms by Union-Free Generic Depth, ArXiv report https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12839 (viewed December 21, 2023).\nThe error occurs at the yellow box below. Consider the following counterexample: Let M = {a, b, a1, b1, c1}. Consider the posets p1 = {(a, b), (a1, c1)}, p2 = {(a1, b1)}, and p3 = {(b1, c1)}. Then {p1, p2, p3} is union-free and generic, since q = {(a, b), (a1, b1), (b1, c1), (a1, c1)} lies only in the closure of p1, p2 and p3, but not in a proper subset, see Lemma 1. Let this q be the q of case i) on page 6. The problem we did not consider is that not every poset that has an edge as described there can be taken out. For example, in this case the edge (a, b) given by p1 satisfies all the properties in (*), but we cannot remove the partial order p1 because we need the edge (a1, c1). Here we also have to consider that we can only remove a poset p if and only if it is not needed for any transitive structure not stemming from p. Of course, one can construct a poset q such that every poset in the union-free and generic set is represented by transitivity in q, but then there is another q\u0303 \u2286 q where at least one poset in the union-free and generic set satisfies the necessary property to be removed. For more details, see Hannah Blocher, Georg Schollmeyer, Malte Nalenz, and Christoph Jansen (2023): Comparing Machine Learning Algorithms by Union-Free Generic Depth, ArXiv report https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.12839 (viewed December 21, 2023).\nIn Blocher et al. [2023] we introduced a depth function, the ufg-depth, for the set of partial orders and with this we gave a notion of centrality for partial orders. The presented ufg-depth is based on sets which are union-free and generic elemnts of a closure system. To obtain the closure operator on the set of partial orders, we used the theory of formal concept analysis (FCA, see below). Formal concept analysis can be used very broadly to represent many kinds of non-standard data in what is called a formal context. From this formal context, one always obtains a closure operator that characterizes the underlying data set, in our case the observed partial orders.\nOur aim in this note is now to prove the connectedness property of these union-free generic sets. This property was given in Blocher et al. [2023] and used to improve the implementation of ufg-depth. The proof uses that the corresponding closure operator is given by the formal context introduced in Blocher et al. [2022]. Since in Blocher et al. [2023] all constructions\nand considerations were made without reference to formal concept analysis, and the proof of the connectedness property is most easily presented in the language of formal concept analysis, we decided to outsource the proof to this short note.\nTherefore, the structure of this note is as follows: Section 2 gives an introduction to partial orders and the main ideas of formal concept analysis. Afterwards, we present the formal context given by Blocher et al. [2022] and the resulting closure system. Furthermore, we define the union-free generic sets as in Blocher et al. [2023]. Section 4 states and proves the connectedness property."

            "heading": "2 PRELIMINARIES: PARTIALLY ORDERED SETS AND FORMAL CONCEPT ANALYSIS",
            "text": "We start by giving some basic definitions of order theory and formal concept analysis. We refer to [Ganter and Wille, 2012, chapters 0-2] or Priss [2006] for a far more extensive and detailed introduction.\nDefinition 1 (Partially ordered set) Let M be a fixed set. Then a partially ordered set (poset) on M is a binary relation p \u2286 M \u00d7M that is\n1. reflexive: \u2200y \u2208 M : (y, y) \u2208 p,\n2. transitive: \u2200y1, y2, y3 \u2208 M : (y1, y2) \u2208 p, (y2, y3) \u2208 p =\u21d2 (y1, y3) \u2208 p and\n3. antisymmetric: \u2200y1, y2 \u2208 M : (y1, y2) \u2208 p, y1 6= y2 =\u21d2 (y2, y1) /\u2208 p.\nFor a fixed set M we denote with P the set of all partial orders on M .\nLater, see Section 3 we represent the set of partial orders within the theory of formal concept analysis. This is done via a formal context:\nDefinition 2 (Formal context, formal concept and associated closure operator) A formal context is a triple K = (G,M, I) where G is a set of objects, M is a set of attributes and I \u2286 G \u00d7 M is a binary relation between the objects and the attributes with the interpretation (g,m) \u2208 I iff object g has attribute m. If (g,m) \u2208 I we also use infix notation and write gIm. Given a formal context K = (G,MI, ) we define the following operators:\n\u03a6 : 2M \u2212\u2192 2G : B 7\u2192 {g \u2208 G | \u2200m \u2208 B : gIm}\n\u03a8 : 2G \u2212\u2192 2M : A 7\u2192 {m \u2208 M | \u2200g \u2208 A : gIm}.\nThen we say that a pair (A,B) with A \u2286 G and B \u2286 M is a formal concept if\n\u03a8(A) = B & \u03a6(B) = A.\nAdditionally, we define the operator\n\u03b3 := \u03a6 \u25e6\u03a8.\nThis operator is a closure operator on G. This means that \u03b3 is:\n1. extensive: \u2200A \u2286 G : A \u2286 \u03b3(A),\n2. isotone: \u2200A,B \u2286 G : A \u2286 B =\u21d2 \u03b3(A) \u2286 \u03b3(B) and\n3. idempotent: \u2200A \u2286 G : \u03b3(\u03b3(A)) = \u03b3(A).\nThe sets \u03b3(A) with A \u2286 G are called the hulls of \u03b3.\nRemark 1 The family {\u03b3(A) | A \u2286 G} of all hulls of \u03b3 is a closure-system. This means that it contains the set G and it is closed under arbitrary intersections. Note that there is a one-to-one relation between a closure operator and a closure system and that both from the closure operator, as well as from the corresponding closure system associated to a formal context, one can get back the whole context. In this sense, \u03b3 (or the hulls {\u03b3(A) | A \u2286 G}) represents the formal context.\nAfter defining closure operators/systems and formal contexts and observing the one-to-one correspondence, we can go a step further. These two mathematical concepts have also a one-to-one correspondence to the family of implications. Generally speaking, implications describe the dependencies between the objects G.\nDefinition 3 (Formal implication) Every closure operator \u03b3 on G can be described by all valid formal implications: A formal implication is a pair (Y, Z) of subsets of G. We say that an implication (Y, Z) is valid w.r.t. a closure operator \u03b3 if \u03b3(Y ) \u2287 \u03b3(Z) and denote this by Y \u2212\u2192 Z . The first component of a formal implication is also called the premise or the antecedent and the second component is also called conclusion or the consequent of the formal implication.\nIn the context of statistical data analysis one often has data that are not binary but for example categorical or, as in our case, every data point is one partial order (on an underlying set). To analyze such data with methods of formal concept analysis one can use the technique of conceptual scaling (cf. [Ganter and Wille, 2012, p.36-45]) to fit such data into a binary setting: For example a categorical variable with the possible values in {1, . . . ,K} one can introduce the K attributes \u201c= 1\u201d, . . . ,\u201c= K\u201d and say that an object g has attribute \u201c= i\u201d if the value of K equals i. In a similar way, for an ordinal variable with possible values {1 < 2 < . . . < K} we can introduce the attributes \u201c\u2264 1\u201d,\u201c\u2264 2\u201d,. . ., \u201c\u2264 K\u201d and say that object g has attribute \u201c\u2264 i\u201d if the value of object g is lower than or equal to i. One can also additionally introduce the attributes \u201c\u2265 1\u201d, . . ., \u201c\u2265 K\u201d. This concrete way of conceptually scaling an ordinal variable is called interordinal scaling. For the case of data that are partial orders, the authors are not aware of any literature that uses formal concept analysis together with a conceptual scaling. Therefore, in Blocher et al. [2022] we introduced a conceptual scaling that we think is adequate for partially ordered data (see the discussion therein)."

            "text": "In Blocher et al. [2022] we defined the formal context K = (G,M, I) with G = P the set of all partial orders on a fixed finite set X = {x1, . . . , xN}. As an appropriate conceptual scaling we use as attributes the set M defined by\nM := {\u201cxi \u2264 xj\u201d | i, j = 1, . . . , N , i 6= j} \ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n=:M\u2264\n\u222a{\u201cxi 6\u2264 xj\u201d | i, j = 1, . . . , N , i 6= j} \ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n:=M6\u2264\n.\nThe binary relation I is given by\n(p , \u201cxi \u2264 xj\u201d) \u2208 I : \u21d0\u21d2 (xi, xj) \u2208 p for p \u2208 P and \u201cxi \u2264 xj\u201d \u2208 M\u2264 (1)\n(p , \u201cxi 6\u2264 xj\u201d) \u2208 I : \u21d0\u21d2 (xi, xj) /\u2208 p for p \u2208 P and \u201cxi 6\u2264 xj\u201d \u2208 M (2)\nNow, according to Section 2, the composition \u03b3 : = \u03a6 \u25e6 \u03a8 defines a closure operator. In the case of the above formal context, we get the following closure operator:\n\u03b3 :\n2P \u2192 2P\n{p1, . . . , pk} 7\u2192\n{\np \u2208 P | k\u22c2\ni=1\npi \u2286 p \u2286 k\u22c3\ni=1\npi\n}\n.\nThe part that each element of the hull must be a superset of the intersection follows from the M\u2264 of the formal context. The second part, that each element must be a subset of the union, follows from the M 6\u2264 attributes. Note that the intersection again defines a poset, while this does not hold for the union.\nNow, we can define S which is used to define the ufg depth. This set consists of elements of the closure system \u03b3(2P) which are generic and union-free. More precisely, we have\nS = {P \u2286 P | Condition (C1) and (C2) hold }\nwith Conditions (C1) and (C2) given by:\n(C1) P ( \u03b3(P ), (C2) There does not exist a family (Ai)i\u2208{1,...,\u2113} such that for all i \u2208 {1, . . . , \u2113}, Ai ( P and \u22c3 i\u2208{1,...,\u2113} \u03b3(Ai) = \u03b3(P ).\nCondition (C1) states that P is not a trivial set in the sense that it implies a strictly larger set than itself. Thus (C1) ensures that there exists a p\u0303 \u2208 P \\ P such that P \u2192 {p\u0303}. Due to condition (C2), we only consider sets in S which are minimal. More precisely, Condition (C2) ensures that there is no suitable subset P\u0303 ( P such that \u03b3(P ) = \u03b3(P\u0303 ) (just set \u2113 = 1 and Ai = P\u0303 ). Following Bastide et al. [2000], we say that every element which has these two properties is called generic. Condition (C2) does more than guarantee that P is minimal. It further ensures that each P cannot be decomposed into proper subsets such that these subsets are sufficient to describe the hull of P . We call this property of having no such family of sets union-free. Thus S consists of union-free generic sets or ufg sets for short."

            "text": "Now we state the main theorem. This theorem was used in Blocher et al. [2023] to make the enumeration of all ufg sets within the computation of the ufg depth compzutationally more efficient.\nTheorem 1 (Connectedness of ufg sets) The family of all ufg sets is connected in the following sense: Let Q = {p1, p2, p3, . . . , pm} be an ufg set of size m \u2265 3. Then there exists a subset R ( Q of size m \u2212 1 that is an ufg set, too.\nTheorem 1 particularly implies that it is possible to enumerate all ufg sets by first enumerating all two-element ufg sets. Then one can recursively start with all currently given ufg sets and try to enlarge every ufg set by adding one partial order to get a new ufg set. If no partial order can be added to get a new ufg set, then one can stop with this set. With this, because of the connectedness property, one finds all ufg sets. Note that unfortunately one will possibly enumerate different ufg sets more than once. In the concrete implementation of the enumeration in Blocher et al. [2023] we avoid this by simply storing all already enumerated ufg sets in a list. Then, in every step of the recursive procedure, we look up if an ufg set candidate was already visited. In this case we stop the corresponding path within the enumearation procedure.\nNote further that in the concrete implementation also other properties of the ufg sets are used:\n1. For an ufg set Q = {p1, . . . pk}, every q \u2208 \u03b3({p1, . . . , pk}) cannot be a candidate for enlarging Q.\n2. Also all partial orders that make an order in pi \u2208 Q redundant (by removing all attributes (or more) that would be removed by pi) are no candidate for enlarging Q, too."

Then S \u2208 S if and only if there exists q \u2208 \u03b3(S) \\ S such that for all x \u2208 S, q 6\u2208 \u03b3(S \\ {x}).\nProof 1 Let us first assume that S \u2208 S . Then, due to Condition (C1), we know that \u03b3(S) \\ S is nonempty. Since ((S \\ {x})x\u2208S) is a family of proper subsets of S, we obtain by Condition (C2) that there must exist an element q \u2208 \u03b3(S)\\S such that for all x \u2208 S, q 6\u2208 \u03b3(S \\ {x}).\nConversely, suppose that there exists q \u2208 \u03b3(S) \\ S such that for all x \u2208 S, q 6\u2208 \u03b3(S \\ {x}). Condition (C1) follows immediately. To prove Condition (C2), let (Ai)i\u2208{1,...,\u2113} be such that for all i \u2208 {1, . . . , \u2113}, Ai ( S is arbitrary. Then for every i \u2208 {1, . . . , \u2113} there is an xi \u2208 S with xi 6\u2208 Ai (follows from Ai ( S). Since \u03b3 is isotone, we know that \u03b3(Ai) \u2286 \u03b3(S \\ {xi}) and since q 6\u2208 \u03b3(S \\ {xi}), q 6\u2208 \u03b3(Ai). Since this argument holds for every i, q 6\u2208 \u22c3 i\u2208{1,...,\u2113} \u03b3(Ai). With (Ai)i\u2208{1,...,\u2113} arbitrarily chosen, the claim follows.\nLemma 1 implies that a subset S \u2286 P is an element of S if there is a poset q \u2208 \u03b3(S) which can be represented only if every single pi \u2208 S is contained. In the formal context of Section 3, this means that for every pi \u2208 S there must be an\nattribute that holds for every other pj \u2208 S, pi 6= pj , but not for pi. This claim will be proved in Lemma 2, but first we need to define this property.\nDefinition 4 Let S \u2286 G = (P) and x \u2208 S. We define the distinguishing attributes of x w.r.t S by\nDx\u2208S : = {m \u2208 M | x 6 Im and for all x\u0302 \u2208 A \\ {x} : x\u0302Im}.\nAssume that S \u2208 S . For q \u2208 P we define the distinguishing attributes of x w.r.t S and restricted to q by\nDqx\u2208S : = {m \u2208 M \\\u03a8(q) | x 6 Im and for all x\u0302 \u2208 A \\ {x} : xIm}.\nFurther, we will use the following notation\nDq\u2264 = \u222ax\u2208SDx\u2208S \u2229M\u2264 Dq6\u2264 = \u222ax\u2208SDx\u2208S \u2229M 6\u2264\nIf it is clear which q we are referring to, then we also write D\u2264 and D6\u2264 instead of D q \u2264 and D q 6\u2264.\nThe next lemma states how the distinguishing attributes can be used to verify if a set is union-free and generic.\nLemma 2 Let S \u2286 G = P . Then S \u2208 S if and only if there exists a q \u2208 \u03b3(S) such that for all x \u2208 S, Dqx\u2208S 6= \u2205.\nProof 2 We prove that the right-hand side of Lemma 1 and the right-hand side of Lemma 2 is equivalent.\nFirst, we assume that the right-hand side of Lemma 1 is true. Thus, there exists a q \u2208 P such that q \u2208 \u03b3(S) and for every x \u2208 S, q 6\u2208 \u03b3(S \\ {x}). Let x \u2208 S be arbitrary. Recall that \u03b3 = \u03a6 \u25e6\u03a8 and therefore, there must exist an m \u2208 \u03a8(S \\ {x}) such that (q,m) 6\u2208 I , but for every x\u0303 \u2208 S \\ {x}, (x\u0303,m) \u2208 I . Since q \u2208 \u03b3(S) (x,m) 6\u2208 I must be true. Thus, Dqx\u2208S 6= \u2205. Second, assume that the right-hand side of Lemma 2 is true. Hence, there exists q \u2208 P such that for every x \u2208 S : Dqx\u2208S 6= \u2205. This means that for every x \u2208 S there exists an m 6\u2208 \u03a8(q) such that (x,m) 6\u2208 I and for all x\u0303 \u2208 S \\ {x} : (x\u0303,m) \u2208 I . Thus, q 6\u2208 \u03b3(S \\ {x}). This gives the right-hand side of Lemma 1\nBefore we proof the main theorem in Section 4 let us state some observations about the distinguishing elements.\nRemark 1: Lemma 2 can be reformulated by using implications as follows: Q = {p1, . . . , pk} with k \u2265 2 is an ufg sets if and only if there exist attributes m1, . . . ,mk \u2208 M\u2264 \u222aM and a partial order q such that\n{p1, . . . , pk} \u2192 {q} and (3)\n\u2200i, j \u2208 {1, . . . , k} : piImj \u21d0\u21d2 i 6= j and (4)\n\u2200i \u2208 {1, . . . , k} : q\u2701Imi. (5)\nFurthermore, note that there could be more than one q \u2208 P fulfilling the property on the right-hand side of Lemma 2. Additionally, for a poset pi there can be more than one distinguishing attribute (w.r.t. fixed q). In the sequel, we will collect in D all distinguishing attributes w.r.t. some pi (and w.r.t. fixed q). Additionally, we will say that two distinguishing attributes m and m\u0303 that distinguish the same order p \u2208 Q (i.e., \u2200i \u2208 {1, . . . , k} : piIm \u21d0\u21d2 piIm\u0303) are equivalent.\nThe next table illustrates the formal context for the set of partial orders and the distinguishing attributes of the ufg set {p1, . . . , pk}. The object q corresponds to the q of the right-hand side of Lemma 2."

In the following, we will show the claim by showing that we can always modify (or replace) the order q to (by) another order q\u0303 that shows via the characterizing properties (3)-5) that for\nD\u2264 D rest\nm1 m2 m3 . . . . . . mn\u22121 mk p1 \u00a9 x x . . . . . . x x p2 x \u00a9 x . . . . . . x x p3 x x \u00a9 . . . . . . x x ... ... ... ... . . . ... ...\n... ... ... ... ... ... . . . ... ... pk\u22121 x x x . . . . . . \u00a9 x pk x x x . . . . . . x \u00a9 q \u00a9 \u00a9 \u00a9 . . . . . . \u00a9 \u00a9\nan appropriately chosen order pi the corresponding proper subset Q\\{pi} of size m \u2212 1 is again an ufg set. Concretely, we distinguish two cases (where case i) is the more difficult case):\nCase i) : As long as D is not empty it is possible to select some distinguishing attribute mi \u2208 D and \u2019remove\u2019 the corresponding pi (such that mi and all possible other distinguishing attributes w.r.t. pi become irrelevant for the reduced set Q\\{pi}) and modify q to q\u0303 to get the subset Q\\{pi} from which we can show with the help of q\u0303 that this subset of size m\u2212 1 is also an ufg set.\nRemark: In this case we have to deal with the possible difficulty that for a partial order pi there exists more than one distinguishing attributes in D . In this case, one has to repeat the recursive procedure described below until one did firstly remove all distinguishing attributes of only one order pi (such that all other orders pj will not become redundant). In case i) it will be important to remove distinguishing attributes by modifying q recursively to other orders q1 . . . , qk =: q\u0303 in such a way that the final order qk (and all other orders ql) are in fact partial orders and in such a way that one removes not all distinguishing attributes of more than one order. (This is needed to make sure that the resulting subset of partial orders is not redundant in implying the resulting q\u0303.)\nIf D is empty, we are in\nCase ii) : Let D = \u2205. In this case we can remove an arbitrary mi \u2208 D\u2264 along with the corresponding pi and we can replace q by q\u0303 := \u22c2\nj 6=i\npi. Then, with the help of q\u0303 we can show that the subset Q\\{pi} of size m\u2212 1 is also an ufg set. Note\nthat in this case, we need not refer to q to get q\u0303, we can in fact remove some arbitrary pi and can replace q by q\u0303 := \u22c2\nj 6=i\npi.\nNow we would like to do the actual proof by going through cases i) and ii):\nThis is where the above error occurs:\nCase i) : First, note that D is a subset of q. This is true, because for an element mi = \u2032 xi x\u2032j we have that property (5) is exactly the statement q\u2701Imi which means that (xi, xj) \u2208 q, compare (2). Because q is a partial order, there cannot be cycles within D . (Note further that D needs not to be transitive.) In particular this implies that the items of q can\nbe totally ordered by a relation L such that L is a linear extension of D .\nNow, take some pair (a, b) \u2208 D with the property\n(\u2217): that there exists no other pair (c, d) \u2208 D with aLc and dLb.\nRemark: Note that the chosen pair is not necessarily a pair in the transitive reduction of q, but this is actually not needed. The final goal will be to remove the pair (a, b) from q to obtain a candidate q\u0303. But before removing (a, b) one possibly has to remove other pairs beforehand, see below. We actually chosed a pair that satisfies (\u2217) to ensure that before removing (a, b) we do not remove another distinguishing pair from D . (This would possibly make our reduced\nset Q\\{pi} redundant.)\nTo find a pair satisfying (\u2217) is in fact possible because D is finite. Now we would like to remove the order pi that corresponds to the distinguishing attribute mi := \u2032 a b\u2032 and construct a partial order q\u0303 from the order q that in contrast to q does not have the pair (a, b) (i.e., (a, b) /\u2208 q\u0303, this would ensure that Q\\{pi} \u2192 {q\u0303}, at least if there are no other equivalent distinguishing attributes) and that does show with Lemma 4.2 that {p1, . . . , pm}\\{pi} is again an ufg set.\nBecause q\u0303 should be transitive, we cannot simply remove (a, b) from q, because we would possibly loose transitivity. Therefore, we successively remove pairs (c, d) from q to get q1, . . . , qk\u22121, and the final candidate qk =: q\u0303. We proceed in the concrete way described below. By going from ql to ql+1 we will proceed in a way that all relations ql are still partial orders (and in particular transitive) and in a way that it always holds that1:\n{p1, . . . , pm}\\{pi} \u2192 q\u0303 , because in the end (a, b) /\u2208 q\u0303) (6)\n\u2200l < k :{p1, . . . , pm}\\{pi}\u271f\u2192 q\u0303l only because (a, b) \u2208 q\u0303l (7)\n(and also because of possible equivalent distinguishing\nattributes)\n\u2200l : \u2200(c, d) \u2208 D \\{(a, b)} :(c, d) \u2208 q\u0303l (this ensures that in the end all pj with i 6= j (8)\nare not redundant in implying q\u0303k.)\nThe concrete way to proceed is the following:\nFirst note that (a, b) \u2208 q because D is a subset of q. Now we look at every path (a, z1), (z1, z2), . . . , (zl, b) of neighboured elements (w.r.t. q) from a to b. Because every pj with j 6= i has the property (a, b) /\u2208 pj there exists (for some arbittrary choosen j 6= i) one (zt, zt+1) with (zt, zt+1) /\u2208 pj . Thus, removing the pair (zt, zt+1) from q\u0303l will not destroy property (7) and in fact will lead to a transitive relation.\nAdditionally, property (8) will also be kept because all (zt, zt+1) are no distinguishing attributes from D because (zt, zt+1) is between the pair (a, b) w.r.t. relation L (cf., property ( \u2217).)\nAfter having deleted one pair (zt, zt+1) for every path from a to b one can now delete also the pair (a, b) without loosing transitivity and one will get the final q\u0303k that has also property (6). Together with property (8) this q\u0303k in fact shows that {p1, . . . , pm}\\{pi} is an ufg set of size m\u2212 1.\nIn the case ii) one can simply remove some arbitrary pi from {p1, . . . , pm} to get Q := {p1, . . . , pm}\\{pi}. That every pi can be choosen follows from the fact that (within D) each pi with i \u2208 {1, . . . ,m} differs from all others only by the existence of non-pairs. Thus, with the partial order q\u0303 := \u22c2\nj 6=i\npj we have:\nQ \u2192 {q\u0303} (because q\u0303 is the intersection of the orders in Q (and as such it is also a\nsubset of the union of the orders in Q)\n\u2200R ( Q : R\u271f\u2192{q\u0303} because every pj with j 6= i has some distinguishing attribute\nmi = \u2032 a \u2264 b\u2032 such that\n\u22c2\nl 6=j,l 6=i\npl \u220b (a, b) but (a, b) /\u2208 q\u0303 (because (a, b) /\u2208 pj).\nCase i) and ii) show that the reduced set Q is in fact an ufg set of size m\u2212 1."
