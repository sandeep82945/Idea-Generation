Such a scenario, however, has only been quantitatively verified for a single stellar-mass black hole3, 4, 5. Although there are hints of these cycles in a few isolated cases6, 7, 8, 9, 10, their apparent absence in\nthe variable emission of most bright accreting neutron stars and black holes has been a lingering puzzle11. Here we report the presence of the same multiwavelength instability around an accreting\nneutron star. Moreover, we show that the variability across the electromagnetic spectrum\u2014from\nradio to X-ray\u2014of both black holes and neutron stars at high accretion rates can be explained con-\nsistently if the accretion disks are unstable, producing relativistic ejections during transitions that\ndeplete or refill the inner disk. Such new association allows us to identify the main physical compo-\nnents responsible for the fast multiwavelength variability of highly accreting compact objects.\nSwift J1858.6\u22120814 (hereafter Swift J1858) is a low mass X-ray binary (LMXB) that was first detected in November 201812 and reached a maximum X-ray luminosity of \u2248 1037 erg s\u22121 (0.6\u201379 keV)13. Spectral analysis showed peculiar properties, including significant obscuration13, 14 (NH \u2248 1023 cm\u22122) and outflows in X-rays15, optical16 and UV17. Moreover, for more than a year after its discovery, the source showed remarkable flaring activity from radio to hard X-rays13, 18, 15, 19. The source returned to quiescence in 2020, but not before exhibiting X-ray eclipses19 and Type-I X-ray bursts20 indicating the presence of an accreting neutron star with an orbital inclination >70\u25e6 at a distance of \u224813 kpc.\nOn the 6th of August 2019, we coordinated a multiwavelength campaign to observe Swift J1858 simultaneously for \u223c4 h with high time resolution in 5 bands: X-rays (3\u201379 keV) with NuSTAR ; UV (150 nm) with the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph onboard the Hubble Space Telescope; optical (i+z sdss band, effective wavelength \u03bbeff = 720 nm) with the RISE at the Liverpool Telescope; near-IR (Ks band, \u03bbeff = 2.2 \u00b5m) with HAWK-I on the Very Large Telescope; and radio (4.5 and 7.5 GHz) with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array. The source showed very strong variability with similar patterns in UV, optical, IR (UV/O/IR), and X-ray (see Figure 1-a-b). On long timescales, Swift J1858 exhibited a repetitive behaviour, alternating between quiet and active/variable phases (Figure 1 and Figure 2). The active phases showed oscillatory behavior on timescales of \u2248100 s; we refer to these as \"beats,\" given their visual similarity to the \"heartbeat\" variability pattern in GRS 1915+1055. On timescales of seconds, the source showed episodic fast flaring events (seen only in IR), which we refer to as \"flares\".\nTo explore the multiwavelength temporal behavior, we computed the cross-correlation function (CCF) between NuSTAR and HAWK-I for all the simultaneous segments in our dataset (see Methods). We measured a clear correlation between the two bands, but the IR lags the X-ray variability with a delay that changes from \u2248 2.5 s to \u2248 5.5 s (see Figure 1-c). The magnitude and orbital phase dependence of these lags are fully consistent with a model where the UV/O/IR beats originate from the irradiation of X-ray beats on a disk and donor star with high orbital inclination (\u2248 80\u25e6) and the orbital period of Swift J1858 (\u224821.3 h19).\nSimple mass accretion rate variations in a hot inflow are not likely to explain the driving X-ray lightcurve2. The X-ray variability observed in Swift J1858 shows significant spectral evolution not compatible with standard variability of accreting compact objects21, 3, 4. In addition, similar variability has been seen in the archetypal high accretion rate stellar-mass black holes GRS 1915+105 and V404 Cyg13. These sources also share other important properties with Swift J1858, such as high luminosity (40% of the Eddington luminosity for Swift J1858), obscuration and ouflows13, 14. This association is strengthened by the remarkable similarity of the IR lightcurve of Swift J1858 and the X-ray lightcurve of the so-called \"\u03b2 \" variability class of GRS 1915+10521 (Figure 2). Even though the patterns are less discernible in the X-ray band for Swift J1858 (probably due to variable line-of-sight obscuration, given its high inclination9, 13, 15, 16), the irradiation origin of the UV/O/IR lightcurve strongly suggests a common physical mechanism for the driving variability in both sources.\nFrom a physical point of view, it is commonly accepted that the recurrent behaviour of GRS 1915+105 (i.e., heartbeats and other limit cycles) is due to a radiation pressure instability in the disk at high accretion rates2, 3, 4, 5. Although not fully confirmed by GRMHD simulations, this instability is believed to drive cyclic accretion or ejection and rebuilding of the inner disk, generating repeating patterns in X-rays on 10\u20131000 s timescales3, 4, 5. If this emission irradiates the disk and companion star, it will give rise to a delayed UV/O/IR lightcurve, such as the one observed in Swift J1858. The interpretation of beats as a disk instability can be tested: both models4 and observations5 of GRS 1915+105 need short-lived jet ejections near the peak luminosity (roughly coincident with the depletion of the disk).\nThe fast IR flares in Swift J1858 appear to verify this hypothesis, giving credence to the radiation\n2/26\npressure instability interpretation of the limit cycles. Aligning and averaging the flares, including 200 s of data before and after each flare, reveals that they take place after the peak of the slower IR beats (see Figure 1-d). But these flares are inconsistent with a thermal origin (see Methods), and, given their red color, we interpret them as direct evidence of optically-thin synchrotron emission from transient/shortlived relativistic jet ejections expected to occur4 during these beat oscillations.\nSwift J1858 also showed significant radio variability throughout our campaign18, which requires explanation. The fast IR flares cannot be responsible for the observed low-frequency variability because their amplitude and duration would naturally lead to their radio emission being completely self-absorbed (\u03c4 \u226b 1 at 10 GHz; see Methods). However, observations of GRS 1915+105 also show \"baby jets\": strong radio flares (though their synchrotron emission can contribute significantly in the IR band22, 23) that are consistent with emission from adiabatically expanding blobs24 (although their launching mechanism is still not clear). To search for baby jets in Swift J1858 and make a comparison to GRS 1915+105, we modeled its variable radio emission as the sum of multiple ejecta25, performing the same analysis on an archival radio observation of GRS 1915+105 (coincident with the \u03b2 -class X-ray lightcurve shown in Figure 2). The results presented in Figure 3 show that the radio variability of both sources is well reproduced by our modelling. For Swift J1858, the model suggests baby jet ejection times (grey shaded areas in Figure 3) near quiet/active phase transitions; most of the ejecta in GRS 1915+105 occur during quiet phases but several fall close to quiet/active transitions as well.\nFor self-consistency, we then tested whether Swift J1858\u2019s baby jets would be detectable in the IR as for GRS 1915+105. Past studies24, 5 show accretion instabilities in GRS 1915+105 when the X-ray and radio luminosity are LBHX \u2248 10 38 erg s\u22121 and LBHradio \u2248 10 30 erg s\u22121, respectively. For Swift J1858, we find LNSX \u2248 10 37 erg s\u22121 and LNSradio \u2248 10\n29 erg s\u2212118. Even under the conservative assumption that the ratio between the IR and radio flux from the jet in Swift J1858 is the same as the one observed in GRS 1915+105 during the \u03b2 -class instability (IR/radio \u2248 1.4)24, then we expect an IR baby jet flux of only \u22480.24 mJy. This is almost a factor of two fainter than the reprocessed emission during the beats (\u22480.4 mJy). This indicates that the two sources share the same disk-jet coupling, despite having qualitatively different radio and IR lightcurves. More broadly, regardless of the jet launching mechanism, this shows how the appearance of accretion instabilities can depend not only on the accretion rate and disk-jet geometry, but also on the binary orbit and the mass of the compact object.\nThere is growing evidence that high-accretion rate black hole sources such as GRS 1915+105, V4641 Sgr, Cyg X-3, and V404 Cygni all share common X-ray spectral variability properties14. However, multiwavelength parallels have proven more difficult due to their different extinctions, hampering efforts to produce a unified physical scenario for this class of sources. Yet, as envisioned from our conclusions, Swift J1858 shows clear analogies with all these objects. Simultaneous multiwavelength observations of the 2015 outburst of V404 Cygni revealed repetitive optical/X-ray patterns with a lag consistent with reprocessing10, 26, 27 and fast non-thermal flares28. Furthermore, its extreme radio variability is consistent with jet ejections taking place during X-ray spectral transitions25. Moreover, similar O-IR recurrent patterns with comparable timescales have also been observed in V4641 Sgr29 and Cyg X-330. Finally, we note that X-ray heartbeats have also been detected in sources like the LMXB IGR J17091\u221236247 and the ULX NGC 326131, which also shows significant line-of-sight obscuration despite having a lower inclination. Thus, the recent association of Swift J1858 as a low-luminosity Z-source32, and the isolated presence of X-ray \"GRS 1915-like\" patterns in other accreting NSs such as the Rapid Burster6 and the Bursting Pulsar33, strongly indicate that Swift J1858 represents the missing link for multiwavelength variability in high accretion rate sources (Figure 2, and Extended Data Figure 1).\nIt was also noted during review that while the limit cycle timescale is similar in GRS 1915+105 and\n3/26\nSwift J1858 (despite their very different masses; see Methods), the beat timescale is much shorter around the black hole in the example lightcurves shown in Figure 2. In fact, GRS 1915+105 exhibits a wide range of beat durations in similar limit cycles21, which suggests that the beats may represent a second instability timescale4 or may be affected by other factors in the accretion flow. One possibility is the jet power, which is expected to have a significant impact on the disk structure, and thus on the observed Xray lightcurve4, 3. A careful comparison of the time-dependent radio/O-IR properties in states or sources with different beat timescales34 could further elucidate the role of jets in shaping these instabilities.\nOur results draw a new coherent picture that links together key aspects of the multiwavelength variability of both black holes and neutron stars at high accretion rate: recurrent repetitive patterns, radio oscillations and fast flaring. At these high accretion rates, the accretion disk becomes unstable, resulting in disk-jet cycles on timescales of \u223c 10 s to \u223c 1000 s. These have historically been observed in X-rays, but our work shows that given the right conditions (e.g., inclination, orbital period, obscuration, and the relative brightness of the jet), accretion instabilities may in fact be more readily observable at UV/O/IR wavelengths. These instabilities are also observationally associated with radio-emitting discrete ejections: therefore, for the first time we can define a consistent physical scenario which can quantitatively account for most of the multiwavelength variability observed from accreting compact objects at high luminosity. We argue that accretion instabilities, irradiation/obscuration, and jet ejecta should be seen as three fundamental pillars that can be used to study other classes of objects accreting near the Eddington limit. With this insight, future time-resolved multiwavelength campaigns on compact objects will lead to better constraints on the physics of these instabilities and their hosts, independently of the nature of the central object8.\n4/26"

The very strong spikes in the IR can introduce spurious peaks in the correlation coefficient26, 27,40, 41. Therefore we computed the CCF excluding and including the short IR flares (i.e. removing data points within \u00b11 s of the flares). We used the discrete CCF method42, 43, rebinning the X-ray events to the HAWK-I time resolution. The lag was evaluated by simulating N = 104 CCFs, randomizing each point using a Gaussian distribution with a \u03c3 corresponding to the empirical error. For each run, the centroid was then computed with a weighted average of the correlation coefficient over a range of 80% from the maximum40. The lag was then evaluated from the\n3https://casaguides.nrao.edu\n11/26\nresulting distribution of centroid lags. The error was obtained from the standard deviation of the obtained distributions. A clear evolution as a function of time of the lags can be seen in Extended Data Figure 2-a .\nWe also checked the IR/UV lags. The HST lightcurve has an absolute timing accuracy up to \u2248 1 s. We therefore computed the CCF between HST and HAWK-I to search for any possible lags with a time resolution of 1 s. As shown in Extended Data Figure 2-b, the CCF peaks at 0. Some asymmetry is seen for lags of \u2248 50 s, which can be explained by the different shapes of the flares.\nFast flaring:\nIn order to study the properties of the fast flares, we selected spikes brighter than 0.7 mJy, finding 11 events in the lightcurve. We then selected 400-s segments centered on the peak values of each flare and averaged them (see Figure 1-d). Given the duration of each data cube of 50 s, we filled the readout gaps using a linear interpolation between the points at the edge, with the addition of Gaussian noise. One flare (taking place around \u2248 6300 s from the start of the observations) showed two peaks separated by \u2248 60 s and was not included in the average. However, its inclusion does not affect the overall trend (Extended Data Figure 3), confirming the connection between short and long timescales.\nIf these flares are produced by thermal gas with non-relativistic bulk motion, their typical timescale of \u2248 1 s indicates a maximum size of the emitting region of R \u2248 1010 cm. In addition, their average IR flux density of approximately 1 mJy (which corresponds to \u2248 10\u221214 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121), together with the source distance of 13 kpc20, yields a brightness temperature of \u2248 106 K. Under these conditions, the thermal gas would emit an X-ray flux of \u2248 10\u22128 erg cm\u22122 s\u22121, which is roughly one order of magnitude higher than the observed one. This discrepancy cannot be solved assuming a smaller IR emitting region, as that would lead to a higher brightness temperature and X-ray flux. Even considering effects of obscuration, with an NH of 1023 cm\u22122 and a covering fraction of 0.9 (i.e. significantly higher than the ones reported by previous X-ray studies13), would give an observed X-ray flux of at least a factor of a few higher. We can therefore rule out a thermal origin for the flares. Given also their red color44, we interpret them as direct evidence of optically-thin synchrotron emission from transient/short-lived relativistic jet ejections expected to take place4,45 during these beat oscillations."

In particular, we set the orbital period to 76841.3 s and tested inclinations between 70 and 90\u25e6. We fixed the neutron star mass to 1.4 M\u2299 and used the same relation between the inclination and the mass ratio defined in past studies19. For the companion temperature we adopted 6100 K (Castro Segura in prep.). Since it is better to have a sharp X-ray flare to measure the delay, we used a triangular function of width 20 s, with the peak at 10 s. We modelled the binary at a range of orbital phases from \u223c 20\u25e6 to \u223c 90\u25e6 in order to cover the 5 epochs at which we have measured lags.\nThe delay between the X-ray and the IR peaks depends slightly on the shape we use for the X-ray flare, but we do find lags compatible with the observations for an inclination around \u223c 80\u25e6. In general, we find that when the companion is not lying too close to the line between the observer and the neutron star, the lag is dominated by the IR reprocessing off the companion. This lag diminishes as the donor becomes more aligned with the observer-NS direction, until a minimum is reached. At that point the lag begins to increase again as the outer disk reprocessing dominates. The minimum lag allowed increases with inclination i, because the mass ratio changes with i. We fit our theoretical models to two sets of\n12/26\nmeasured lags: the ones obtained including the flares in the lightcurves, and the ones excluding them (see left panels of Extended Data Figure 4, top and bottom respectively). The data points follow the theoretical trend remarkably well in both cases. When we include the flares, the posterior distribution is slightly skewed, preferring higher inclinations, with median at i = 80.3\u25e6 (0.5, 16, 84, 99.5 percentiles at 76.2\u25e6, 78.4\u25e6, 82.0\u25e6, 84.1\u25e6). When we exclude the flares, due to the lower value of the lag at phase \u223c 45\u25e6 (which is also the least precise), the distribution prefers lower inclinations. At any rate, the result is compatible with the previous result, having median at i = 79.3\u25e6 (percentiles at 75.6\u25e6, 77.6\u25e6, 81.1\u25e6, 83.5\u25e6). This figure confirms that the lag is indeed due to reprocessing of the X-rays. These values are fully consistent with the inclination obtained by modelling the eclipse profiles during the final stages of the outbursts.\nFast IR flare modelling\nA consistent interpretation of the fast IR flares needs to reconcile the following features: i) the IR flare duration time in the observer frame (tIR); ii) the observed frequency of the emission (\u03bdIR); iii) the peak flux density of the flare (FIR); and iv) that a bright flare is not simultaneously seen in the radio band. Here we introduce a simplified physical model that is capable to explain these features and derive additional information on the source from these constraints. In what follows we denote quantities in the jet reference frame with a prime. The relevant transformations between reference frames are given by t = t \u2032/\u03b4 , \u03bd = \u03b4\u03bd \u2032, and F = \u03b4 3F \u2032, where \u03b4 (\u0393,\u03b8) is the jet Doppler factor25. For this calculation we will assume that the jet is launched perpendicularly to the accretion disk, such that \u03b8 = i, and with semi-relativistic velocities, \u03b2 = 0.7\u00b10.2 (jet Lorentz factor \u0393j = 1.4\u00b10.2).\nBoth the synchrotron cooling time of a particle, tsyn \u221d B2 E\u22121e , and the characteristic frequency of the emitted photons, \u03bdsyn \u221d BE2e , depend on the energy of the electron, Ee, and the magnetic field intensity in the emitter, B48. We assume that the duration of the flare is given by the electron synchrotron cooling time, that is, condition i) translates into t \u2032syn(E,B) = t \u2032 IR. Moreover, the observed photon frequency should match the synchrotron frequency, so that condition ii) reads \u03bdIR = \u03bdsyn. Thus, from conditions i) and ii) we can derive the magnetic field intensity in the jet and the energy of the emitting electrons (B \u2248 553\u00b1 22 G and Ee \u2248 207\u00b1 8 MeV, respectively). One caveat of this is that the magnetic field should not vary significantly during the duration of the flare in the jet frame (\u223c 6 s). In addition, one can assume that the observed flux is due to optically thin synchrotron emission from a relativistic electron population of the form N(E)dE = N0E\u2212pdE, with p \u223c 2.2 (see radio modelling section). We further assume that the minimum and maximum energies of the electrons are 1 MeV and 1 TeV, respectively, and normalize the electron distribution by adopting an equipartition energy condition, Ue = UB, which ties the energy densities in relativistic electrons and the magnetic field. With that, we can obtain N0 from Ue =\n\u222b Emax Emin EN(E)dE, and use it to calculate the optically-thin synchrotron SED at any given frequency48. Considering that the emitter is homogeneous and spherical, from condition iii) we can estimate its size to be R0 \u2248 4.7\u00b10.2\u00d71010 cm. Thus, the IR-emitting jets are more compact and with much higher magnetic fields than the radio jets. Finally, we verify that condition iv) holds. Having the emitter size, the electron population, the magnetic field and the synchrotron luminosity, we can calculate the SSA opacity25. We obtain \u03c4 \u223c 106 \u226b 1 at 10 GHz, and \u03c4 \u223c 10\u22126 \u226a 1 at IR frequencies, showing that the derived values are consistent with the proposed scenario. We note that the overall conclusions do not change if we assume a broader range of jet velocities: adopting \u03b2 \u226a 1 leads to variations in the results below 25%, whereas for \u03b2 = 0.99 (\u0393j = 10) variations are within a factor two, except for the flare time in the jet frame that increases up to \u223c 30 s.\n13/26"

            "text": "Swift J1858: Jet synchrotron emission is known to produce strong radio variability, often in the form of flaring activity displaying a distinct observational signature where longer wavelength signals appear as a delayed, smoothed version of shorter wavelength signals. As our radio data exhibit this behavior, we attempted to model them and in turn quantify any relationship between the IR flares and the variations observed at longer wavelengths49. We implement the van der Laan synchrotron bubble model49, using the formalism outlined in Tetarenko et al.25. Briefly, this model describes the emission from ballistically moving, adiabatically expanding, bi-polar jet components, folding in projection and relativistic effects. To perform the modelling, we use a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm (EMCEE50), simultaneously fitting both radio frequency bands. Here we allow each ejected pair of jet components to have a different ejection time, peak flux, and speed, while tying the opening angle, inclination angle, magnetic field, and electron energy distribution (assumed to follow a power-law of the form N(E)dE \u221d E\u2212pdE, where p is related to the optical depth at the peak of the flare via e\u03c4p \u2212 (2p/3+1)\u03c4p+1 = 0) across all components. The radii of the ejecta at the peak of the flare are determined via Rp = ( Fpd 2\n\u03c0S\u03bd (p,Bp) 1 1\u2212e\u2212\u03c4p\n)0.5 , where\nS\u03bd(p,Bp) is the synchrotron source function dependent on the electron energy distribution and magnetic field at the peak of the flare. We use wide uniform priors for most model parameters, but sample from the known distance distribution (12.8\u00b10.18 kpc, with bounds of 9\u201318 kpc), and use previous constraints on inclination in the literature to define this parameter\u2019s prior (uniform between 70\u201390\u25e619, 20). We ran two modelling cases; (1) ejection times are unconstrained (see Extended Data Figure 5 and Extended Data\nTable 1), (2) ejection times are constrained to only lie within the IR beats, as we may expect if both the IR and radio are synchrotron in origin (see Figure 3 and Extended Data Table 2).\nWe find that both the modelling runs do a reasonable job of reproducing the radio light curves, capturing most of the flaring structure across both bands, with a similar quality of fit between runs. Our best-fit models contains 4 jet ejection events, where the ejection times coincide with IR flares occurring during the rapid variability periods. Although, the connection between radio and IR is more pronounced in modelling case (2), as we are better able to match up specific jet components to individual IR flares with lower uncertainty. Figure 3 displays the best-fit model for modelling case (2), overlaid on our radio light curves, and compares best-fit ejection times to the IR light curves (best-fit parameters are given in Extended Data Table 2). Overall, we find that as we only need 4 ejections to reproduce the radio emission, most of the IR short flares do not actually become observable radio jet ejections. Although, we do notice that the jet ejection times seem to cluster near the boundaries of the rapid variability periods.\nGRS 1915+105\nWith the GRS 1915+105 data, we follow the same modelling procedure as that of Swift J1858, allowing each ejected pair of jet components to have a different ejection time, peak flux, and speed, while tying the opening angle, inclination angle, magnetic field, and electron energy distribution across all components. We use wide uniform priors for most model parameters, but sample from the known distance (8.6\u00b1 2.0 kpc51) and inclination angle (60\u00b1 5\u25e651) distributions. With GRS 1915+105 we do not place any constraints on ejection times. Here we use an incremental approach, building up our model flare by flare, to find the minimum number of components we need to reasonably reproduce the radio light curves. Additionally, as we find that the data does not allow us to put tight constraints on the electron energy distribution index, we fix this parameter to p = 2.2 (equivalent to \u03c4p = 1.6, as expected from a Fermi acceleration mechanism via a single shock, commonly assumed for X-ray binary jets52, 53, 54).\nWe find that in GRS 1915+105 we can reproduce the radio light curves reasonably well with 11 jet ejection events. Figure 3 displays the best-fit model overlaid on our radio light curves, and compares best-fit ejection times to the X-ray light curves (best-fit parameters are given in Extended Data Table 3).\n14/26\nUpon comparing the best-fit parameters between Swift J1858 and GRS 1915, we find that the magnetic field strength of the ejecta are quite different between the two sources. This difference appears to be a natural consequence of the model. Given that the ejecta radii in the model are proportional to magnetic field strength and peak flux (among some other dependencies such as distance), to produce similar ejecta radii in both sources (as expected from the similar flare duration timescales) the lower peak fluxes in Swift J1858 with respect to GRS 1915 naturally result in a larger magnetic field estimate for Swift J1858. Moreover, similarly to what has been observed in past studies24,55, the ejection times in GRS 1915 appear to lie in the dips between the rapid variability periods (seen here in the X-ray rather than the IR of Swift J1858). However, we notice that a sub-set of lower peak flux components have ejection times that lie close to the boundaries of the rapid variability periods. Interestingly, these fainter components seem to follow brighter ejections that tend to be launched closer to the beginning of a dip period rather than in the middle of it.\nTo verify our key result in regards to the timing of the jet ejections in GRS 1915+105, and to evaluate how model dependent such a result was, we performed additional modeling runs under different conditions. In particular, we performed two other modeling runs using an 8 jet component model (i.e., without the extra lower peak flux components) with the electron energy distribution index fixed and free. The fixed model can reproduce the shoulders in the early flares but still has trouble reproducing the later peaks, while the free model can reproduce the flare decays well but not the shoulder features. Additionally, the free model favours a much lower electron energy distribution index of p \u223c 0.8, which lies outside the typical range (p = 2\u22123) produced with the Fermi acceleration via a single shock mechanism commonly assumed in these types of jets. However, regardless of the differing model properties used in these extra runs, we find that all modeling runs still produce the same ejection time pattern, with the jet ejection times coinciding with the dip periods between variable sections of the X-ray light curve."

In June 2019 Swift J0858 was observed using CHIMERA57, a 2-band rapid photometer mounted on the Hale Telescope. The instrument uses frame-transfer, electron-multiplying CCDs to achieve 15 ms dead time and is ideally used to study sub-second variability. Observations were obtained in g\u2019 and r\u2019 filters while CHIMERA was operated using the conventional amplifier with 0.2\u20131.0 second exposures with 2\u00d72 binning. Images were bias subtracted and flat-field corrected while aperture photometry was carried out using the standard CHIMERA pipeline57. Fluxes reported in this paper were estimated via differential photometry with respect to nearby stars.\nIn 2019 October 4 the field was observed by Palomar\u2019s Wafer-Scale camera for Prime (WASP58) wide field prime focus camera using 10 s exposures, while the additional dead-time between observations is of the same order. Bias subtraction, flat field correction, and cosmic ray removal were performed with IRAF59. The night conditions were not photometric and differential aperture photometry was also performed in comparison to nearby stars.\nWe divided the lightcurves in 20 flux bins and computed their cumulative distribution functions. As shown in Extended Data Figure 6, the only apparent difference is between the Chandra and IR flux distributions at a mean-normalized flux of 0.7. However, due to the different amplitude between the Xray and O/IR flares, we also computed the distribution of the X-ray after applying a linear rescaling to make the X-ray minimum and maximum match the O/IR. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test indicates that the GRS 1915+105 X-ray lightcurve and the Swift J1858 OIR lightcurve are consistent with a single flux distribution. This analysis demonstrates that the O/IR variability patterns observed in August in Swift J1858 are commonly seen throughout the entire outburst and that they are compatible with the limit cycles in GRS 1915+105."

For the HAWK-I lightcurve, gaps were filled using a linear interpolation between the points at the edge, with the addition of Gaussian noise. While the correlation between X-ray and UV is relatively poor (\u03c1 \u2248 0.4), the correlation between UV, Optical and IR is clearly visible (see Extended Data Figure 7-a). The powerlaw index of the correlations were \u03b2HAWK\u2212I = 0.3\u00b10.02 and \u03b2LT = 0.43\u00b10.03 for HAWK-I and LT, respectively.

As shown for the case of the Bursting Pulsar GRO J1744\u22122860, the condition to show accretion disk instabilities is\n16/26\nwhen the magnetospheric radius Rm is larger than the star radius R\u2217.

(6)\nAccording to these equations, depending on their magnetic field, neutron stars with a luminosity of at least \u2248 1036 erg s\u22121, may show a radiation pressure dominated inner disk (see Extended Data Figure 1). Therefore, we compiled a luminosity vs magnetic field diagram for a subset of sources to verify the self-consistency of our proposed scenario. As shown in Extended Data Figure 1 all accreting neutron stars that show \"GRS 1915-like\" repetitive patterns lie on the radiation pressure dominated disk region of the parameter space6, 31,33. The plot also shows the typical ranges regarding standard classes of accreting neutron stars.\nAt low magnetic fields (<109 G), we note that Swift J1858 lies in the radiation pressure dominated area and, as indicated by recent X-ray/radio studies32, is also between Atolls and Z sources. The latter group is known to have clear evidence of outflows and radio ejecta: this strongly suggests that accretion instabilities may play a significant role in explaining the unique phenomenology of Z sources61, 62. Interestingly, we note that also the Rapid Burster lies in the radiation pressure dominated regime6, even though the source does not always display such variability. Therefore, luminosity alone doesn\u2019t seem to be the only element necessary to trigger 1915-like patterns.\nAs for intermediate magnetic fields between 109 and 1011 G, the Bursting Pulsar63 is known to show strong repetitive burst patterns similar to GRS 1915+10563. In this region of the parameter space Terzan 5 X-2 also showed outflows close to its peak luminosity64 (i.e. within the radiation pressure regime), but non-stationary variability patterns were not observed.\nFor sources with a very high magnetic field (>1012 G), the radiation pressure dominated disk solution requires a luminosity LX > 5\u00d71038erg s\u22121, i.e. almost in the Ultraluminous X-ray sources (ULXs) regime. For such high accretion rates it is argued that outflows are formed within the spherization radius65, 66. A particular interesting group of these sources are pulsating ULXs (PULXs), which due to their proximity and high brightness enable detailed studies of accretion in the super-Eddington regime. Spectral and temporal studies within the last five years have allowed us to obtain the magnetic field, as well as evidence for the presence of outflows in several sources67, 68, 69, 70, 71, which define a clear region of the parameter space beyond the radiation pressure dominated disk transition. Interestingly, we note that, as for the notorious Swift J0243.6+6124, some accreting pulsars can also behave as transient ULXs with luminosities well above the typical values of High mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs)72. In fact, such systems have been seen already in the Magellanic Clouds73, 74. For these nearby transient ULXs and many of the traditional ULXs there is evidence of ionized emission and absorption that may be associated with outflows and disk winds75.\nThe brightest source to display \"GRS 1915-like\" patterns is the ULX NGC 362131. However, the nature of its central object is still unknown. Therefore, even though the source is clearly in the radiationpressure dominate disk region, it is not possible to fully constrain its position in the L vs B diagram.\n17/26"

The long dashed line represents the limit in the parameter space for which the inner disk is (blue) or not (red) radiation pressure dominated: i.e. where the transition between zone A and B (RAB) of a Shakura Sunayev76 disk is greater than the magnetospheric radius (Rm) or the star radius (R\u2217), whichever is larger. Since the disk rotates with Keplerian velocity, for large Rm the inner disk rotates slower than the NS magnetosphere and accretion can be halted due to the propeller effect77. The dashed grey lines correspond to the propeller threshold luminosities as a function of the magnetic field for different spins77, 78. For all these lines we set \u03be = 1, \u03b1 = 0.1, MNS = 1.4 M\u2299 and R = 10 km. We then marked the sources which displayed \"1915-like\" variability patterns (green tick) in their lightcurves: the Rapid Burster6, the Bursting Pulsar60, 63, the ULX NGC 326131 and our target Swift J1858. Along with these we also displayed the different phenomenological classes of accreting neutron stars X-ray binaries, depending on their magnetic field and luminosities. At low magnetic field (\u2264109 G) we find classical LMXBs, which, depending on their accretion rate, can manifest as Atolls, bright Atolls or Z sources79, 80. X-ray timing studies have also shown that accreting millisecond pulsars (AMXPs), with a magnetic field in the 108\u22129 G range, are also compatible with Atolls in their hard state81. For higher magnetic fields of 109 G, the observed accreting neutron stars usually show pulsations, but, due to the lower propeller threshold, have also slower spin periods with respect to AMXPs. Above 1011 G, the diagram is mainly populated by High mass X-ray binaries82, 83 (HMXBs) and Pulsating Ultraluminous X-ray sources84. For all these classes/objects we also marked which of them show typical phenomenology linked to accretion instabilities, i.e radio ejecta (yellow star) and outflows (cyan waves). We note that these phenomena tend to appear above the radiation pressure disk threshold (see Methods).\n22/26\n0 0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1\n-100 -50 0 50 100\nHAWK-I vs HST\nC C\nF\nIR Lag (s)\n0-2000s ba\nHAWK-I vs NUSTAR HAWK-I vs HST\nIR Lag (s)\nExtended Data Figure 2|Infrared Lag analysis.
