For these applications, the stability of the niobium component is important for maintaining the catalytic performance, but challenges remain, as niobium ([Kr]4d45s1) is highly reactive with various chemicals. For example, niobium readily coordinates with carbon monoxide, which is an important but toxic reduction gas used in themetallurgical industry and is also the main component of syngas. There has been much research interest in the adsorption mechanism of CO on diverse metals [9\u201312] and in new catalysts that can convert and remove toxic CO; insights have been gained regarding the chemical bonding in transition metal (TM) carbonyl clusters [13].However, a pending question remains on how to rationally design CO-tolerant [14\u201317] metal catalysts for highly efficient chemoselective reactions. Metal clusters bridge the gap between atoms and macroscopic materials, enabling us to reveal the chemical mechanisms involved in the aforementioned processes. Stable metal clusters are often determined through a reaction with oxygen, and their stabilities are reinforced at electronic/geometric shell closures based on the nearly free electron gas theory ofmetals and the jelliummodel [18,19], such as the findings of spheroidal Al13\u2212 [20], Ag17\u2212 [21] and Au55 [22]. The spheroidal structure was also addressed for a series of heteroatom-doped clusters [23\u201325] enabling the optimal packing of atoms and tuneable valence electrons. Previous studies have also predicted the high stability of a few hollow-cage metal and non-metal clusters, such as Au16\u2212, Au32 and C60 [26\u201328]. Also illustrated is that the radial extension of the outermost d-electrons of TMs\nC\u00a9TheAuthor(s) 2022.

However, it is challenging to fully understand how the d-bands construct superatom orbitals and how superatom states behave in the gas-phase reactions of TM clusters.\nWith one atom making a difference, the stability and the reactivity of metal clusters are highly dependent on the size and geometric/electronic structures. For example, the reactivities of Al12\u2212 with various chemicals were found to be in sharp contrast to the high stability of Al13\u2212 [34]. Additionally, the reactivity of oxygen reduction on Pt12 and Pt13 clusters embodies significantly different catalysis [35]. For niobium, previous studies have observed the altered relative inertness of Nb8, Nb10+/0 and Nb12+/0 in gas-phase reactions [36\u201339]. However, a parallel comparison of the stability and reaction mechanisms of pure niobium clusters is limited. It is significantly challenging to identify a magic number of Nbn+ clusters and strictly differentiate the size-dependent cluster stability and reactivity.\nHere, we report a study of rich-pressure reactions of Nbn+ with CO by a customized multi-ion laminar flow tube reactor in tandem with a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (MIFT-TQMS). As a result, Nb12+ was found to be inert in the reaction with CO, which is in sharp contrast to its neighbouring clusters. Nb12+ was also found to be inert in reactions withN2 andC2H4. First-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations demonstrate that the cluster stability of Nb12+ is associatedwith its slightly distorted icosahedral cage structure and superatomic orbitals involving both contributions from the 5s and 4d electrons. We named this aromatic full-metal hollow-cage niobium cluster \u2018niobespherene\u2019 and propose CO-tolerant Nb12+ as a promising candidate for designing new materials and catalysts."

            "text": "Figure 1 presents the mass spectra of Nbn+ (n = 1\u201326) before and after reacting with CO (for more details see Figs S3\u201310), where the clusters Nbn+ with n \u2265 3 all generate multiple CO adsorption products and the number of adsorbed CO molecules increases progressively with the rising flow rate of the CO reactant gas. The larger the size of the Nbn+ cluster, the more reactive sites available for CO adsorption. In the Nbn+ (n \u2265 3) series, Nb12+ is prominently inert with dramatically fewer Nbn(CO)m+ products than other Nb clusters of\nsimilar sizes. With an increasing gas flow rate of CO, Nb12+ becomes more dominant in the mass spectrum, in sharp contrast to the rest of the pure clusters, which are almost depleted in the reaction (Fig. 1c). Repeated reaction experiments with different distributions of Nbn+ clusters, different reaction times and varying CO concentrations, all conclude that Nb12+ is prominently inert. It is worth mentioning that neither the cation Nb+ nor the dimer Nb2+ reacts with CO, likely because the collisions in the high-pressure flow tube allow vibrationally excited transients to undergo rapid desorption in parallel with thermalization by He collisions that remove excess energy. This is consistent with previous similar studies [40\u201343]. Also, there are unmountable transition state energy barriers for dissociative CO adsorption on Nb+ and Nb2+, which is in sharp contrast to that of Nb3+ (Fig. S41). Figure 2a shows a histogram of the integral area of the mass spectrum peaks of the Nbn(CO)m+ products and the residual Nbn+ clusters (n = 7\u2013 16, m = 0\u20138). The mass abundance of the remaining Nb12+ after the reaction is nearly 10 times larger than that of the other unmodified Nbn+ clusters. Figure 2b plots the reaction rate constants based on Ferguson\u2019s method for laminar flow tube reactors [44] (mode 2) in comparison with the quasi first-order reaction rate equation [45] (mode 1) (Figs S11\u201313 and Table S1). The logarithmic ratio of Nbn+ after and before the reaction, i.e.\u2014 ln (I/I0), shows a proportional relationship with the gas flow of the CO reactant (Fig. S13), indicating the dominant CO-addition reactions with the niobium clusters (i.e. Nbn+ +mCO\u2192Nbn(CO)m+). Nb12+ breaks the increasing trend of the reaction rates and corresponds to the local minimum value. This result is consistent with a previous study on charge-dependent CO adsorption on such TM clusters [46]. In addition, the unique inertness of Nb12+ can also be observed in the reactions with N2 and C2H4 (Figs 14 and 15, and Table S2) and is consistent with the reaction of Nbn+ with other hydrocarbons [37]."

This hollow-cage structure of Nb12+ is simi-\nlar to that of Ta12+ but is different from that of V12+ (a comparison given in Fig. S32) [49\u201351]. Similarly, ground-state Nb10+ also takes the form of a hollowcage structure (a comparison of Nb10+ vs. Nb12+ is given in Figs S33 and S34), which is in agreement with the ground states of V10+ and Ta10+ [51]. The Nb13, 14+ clusters bear an irregular structure containing anNb core, which is reminiscent of the structure of the Al13+ cationic cluster [52]. In comparison, the Nb15-20+ clusters all correspond to coreshell structures containing a mono-niobium core. It is worth mentioning that the lowest energy structures of the anionic and neutral niobium clusters bear differences with the cations. For example, the neutral Nb12 could prefer an asymmetry character with a salient dipole moment [53], which concurs with the low-temperature experiments [54]; but the similar isomer of the Nb12+ cation is much higher in energy than the slightly distorted icosahedron (Figs S16 and S32).\nFigure 3b shows the electron affinity energies of the Nb7-16+ clusters. Interestingly, Nb12+ is located at the minimum point, indicating that Nb12+ is themost unfavourable structure for accepting electrons from ligands among all the studied Nbn+ clusters. Figure 3c shows the gaps between the highestoccupied molecular orbital (HOMO) and lowestunoccupiedmolecular orbital (LUMO)of the\u03b1 and \u03b2 orbitals of Nb7-16+. Interestingly, the \u03b2 HOMOLUMO gap of Nb12+ is as high as 1.26 eV, which is larger than that of any other cluster. Previous studies have illustrated that the diversity of CO coordination reactions is essentially associated with the local polarization, ligand-to-metal electronic donation and inverse \u03c0 backdonation [55\u201358]. Here, the relatively high energy level of the \u03b1-LUMO of Nb12+ could restrict the donation of electron pairs from the 5\u03c3 orbital of the CO ligand; additionally, a large \u03b2 HOMO-LUMO gapminimizes the electronic backdonation to the vacant 2\u03c0\u2217 orbitals of CO."

Interestingly, the peak intensities of Nb11CO+ and Nb13CO+ are nearly equal in mass spectra, but the binding energies of CO on the Nb11+ and Nb13+ are significantly different from each other. It is speculated that the CO-bonding mode, adsorption energy and dissociation energy, as well as the stability of nascent metal clusters, contribute to a balance of the final mass spectrometry observation.\nThe natural population analysis (NPA) of charge distribution of Nb1-20+ (Fig. S19) shows that each atom on Nb12+ has an evenly distributed charge between 0 and 0.1 |e|, while the other cage clusters Nb7-11+ display a variety of charge distributions, and the Nb13-20+ clusters display negative charge accumulation on the core atom (\u22121.2 |e| to \u22121.6 |e|) and a positive charge on the shell atoms (0.15 |e| to 0.4 |e|). In the presence of CO, the sizedependent charge distribution (Tables S5 and S6) results in variation in the electron transfer between the Nbn+ clusters and CO, giving rise to C\u2013O bond activation to different degrees, as shown in Fig. 3e. Nb12CO+ possesses the shortest C\u2013O bond length at 1.16 A\u030a and the largest C\u2013O bond order among the studied systems, as well as a minor change in the HOMO-LUMO gap of Nb12CO+ compared with that of Nb12+ (Fig. S36). In addition, from the energy decomposition analysis (EDA) and infrared-active vibrational modes before and after CO adsorption (Fig. S40 and Table S7), Nb12CO+\nPage 4 of 9\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /nsr/article/10/3/nw ac197/6711083 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 25 January 2024\nalso shows the minimal \u03bd(C\u2013O) value and the lowest interaction energies (Fig. S44, Tables S9 and S10) among all the studied NbnCO+ clusters."

            "text": "Nb12+ possesses a spheroidal icosahedral cage structure and an open electronic shell with 59 valence electrons in total. To fully illustrate its electronic structure, Fig. 4 presents adiagramof thepartial density of states (PDOS),where the compositions of the s, p and d shells and the selected canonical molecular orbitals (CMOs) are displayed. It is interesting that the CMOs display remarkable superatomic features with a high degree of electron cloud delocalization throughout the whole cluster. The icosahedral hollow-cage structure and the formation of superatomicorbitals account for the enhanced stability of theNb12+ cluster.Through the natural atomic orbital (NAO) method, we analysed the superatomic orbital composition (Tables S11\u201319). The superatomic 1S orbital mainly originates from the valence 5s orbitals (\u226560%) and 4s orbitals (\u223c24%) of the Nb atoms; however, the main contribution to the superatomic 2S orbital comes from the valence 4d electrons. Similarly, the superatomic 1P orbital originates from the valence 5s shell, while the 2P orbital is formed by the valence 4d electrons of Nb atoms [59]. In brief, there are two sets of superatomic orbitals. One set is 1S2|1P6 composed of s-electrons, while the other set is 2S2|2P6|1D10 composed of delectrons.\nThe superatomic feature results in balanced electron\u2013nuclei interactions, which account for the enhanced stability of Nb12+. Furthermore, we provide insights into its chemical inertness in reaction with CO. Based on the electronegativities of the atoms (1.6 for niobium and 2.55 for carbon), the Nb\u2013C bonding in these NbnCO+ clusters is not ionic. To form coordinate-covalent bonds, a proper match, including orbital symmetry and related energy levels of d-state occupation is important [60]. Here, Nb12+ displays the highest number of unmatched orbital patterns with CO, and the LUMO energy level of Nb12+ is one of the highest among all the Nbn+ (n = 1\u201320) clusters (Fig. S27). In addition, when the d-states are located far away from the HOMO energy level of CO, sp\u2013d hybridization is reduced, giving rise to a relatively weak coordinate and smaller adsorption energy.Thed-bandofNb12+ is located far below the\u03b1-HOMOenergy levelwith a gap of 1.04 eV calculated at theBPW91/Lanl2TZ(f) level, which is in sharp contrast to the d-bands of the other studied clusters. The distinction of Nb12+ is also associated with its \u03b1-HOMO pattern, which is mainly composed of p-state electrons of the niobiumatoms (seePDOS inFig. 4). In addition, the\u03b2HOMOhas a low energy level and there is an unusually large\u03b2 HOMO-LUMOgap up to 1.26 eV at the BPW91/Lanl2TZ(f) level (a B3LYP method works out at an even larger value of 2.13 eV, Fig. S28).\nIn addition, we also compared the Kohn-Sham orbital correlation diagrams of Nb12CO+ and Nb10CO+ (Fig. S45). The \u03c0 backdonation in Nb12CO+ (Nb12+\u2192CO) is relatively weak, which is only associated with the \u03b1-HOMO of Nb12+ and the vacant 2\u03c0\u2217 orbital of CO. In contrast, there are relatively strong \u03c0 backdonation interactions of both \u03b1 and \u03b2 orbitals in Nb10CO+, as well as in the other NbnCO+ systems. In brief, the experimentally observed relative inertness of Nb12+ is not only associated with its distinct geometric and electronic stability but also rationalized by the bonding nature and coordination interactions."

In addition, the analysis of gauge-includingmagnetically induced current (GIMIC) shows ring current inside the hollow cage when an external magnetic field is applied (insets in Fig. 5c). The GIMIC calculation results show an induced current of 1.13 nA/T in total, with a dominant positive contribution of the \u03b2 density at 2.91 nA/T and a negative contribution\n(\u22121.78 nA/T) to the \u03b1 density. In this regard, the aromaticity of Nb12+ is dominated by the \u03b2 density, which is similar to a recent study on a Pt10 cluster [62].The insets in Fig. 5c also present the integrated electron density using the localized orbital locator (LOL) [63], where the LOL values for hollow-cage Nb12+ are close to 0.3, indicating distinct electron delocalization in the related region.\nNiobespherene Nb12+ and Nb122+ As a comparison, a closed-shell cluster Nb122+ with 58 valence electrons has also been studied to fully reveal the superatomic nature of such a cage cluster. As shown in Fig. 6, the orbital energy levels of Nb122+ shift downwards as a whole and become more degenerated. It is inferred that the closed-shell Nb122+ is more stable than Nb12+ given the larger HOMOLUMO gap (1.60 eV by BPW91 level of theory, and even larger at 2.5 eV calculated by B3LYP, Fig. S29), which also leads to inconvenient \u03c0 backdonation both from the \u03b1 and \u03b2 orbitals of Nb122+. It is worth mentioning that not all 58 valence electrons delocalize and occupy the superatomic orbitals; instead, only 26 of them embody obvious superatomic features (1S2|2S2|1P6|2P6|1D10|).The other valence electrons are subject to s-d related hybridization, contributing to the local Nb\u2013Nb bonds thus beneficial to the skeleton stability [59]. We calculated the value of the distortion parameter to evaluate the energy levels in the ClemengerNilsson diagram (Fig. S46). As a result, Nb10+ shows the largest distortion among the three clusters (Nb12+, Nb122+ and Nb10+), which is associated with fewer valence electrons delocalized in the occupied superatomic orbitals. In comparison, Nb12+ andNb122+ have a smaller distortionpertaining to the Jahn-Teller effect, and are both associated with 26 electrons (1S2|2S2|1P6|2P6|1D10|) occupying the frontier superatomic orbitals. In reference to previous studies of cage clusters of Pb122\u2212 (\u2018stannaspherene\u2019) and Sn122\u2212 (\u2018plumbaspherene\u2019) [64], we named the full-metal hollow-cage niobium cluster Nb12+ \u2018niobespherene\u2019 and studied it to better understand its reasonable stability and superatomic nature."

Quantum chemistry calculations revealed that the global minima structure of Nb12+ corresponds to a slightly distorted icosahedron. This highly symmetric structure gives rise to wellorganized superatomic orbitals with the electron shell assigned to 1S2|2S2|1P6|2P6|1D10. Interestingly, Nb12+ contains two sets of superatomic orbitals; one set is 1S2|1P6 and is composed of selectrons, while the other set is 2S2|2P6|1D10 and is composed of d-electrons. Although the d-orbitals of each atom are anisotropic in space, they match each other and form energy-descent superatomic 2S and 2P orbitals that delocalize throughout the Nb12+ cluster and balance the geometric and electronic structure, giving rise to enhanced stability.We named this Nb12+ cluster \u2018niobespherene\u2019 and revealed its cage aromaticitywith a reasonable induced ring current and an NICS value of \u221237.0 ppm. We demonstrated the origin of the chemical inertness of Nb12+ in reaction with CO, which shows top-site adsorption onNb12+, corresponding to the smallest binding energy.This is in contrast to the hollow-site\nandbridge-site adsorption for the other studied clusters. This study helps build an understanding of the formation of superatomic clusters with d-electrons and provides a strategy to design CO-tolerant materials that can prevent the block of catalytic activity caused by CO poisoning."
