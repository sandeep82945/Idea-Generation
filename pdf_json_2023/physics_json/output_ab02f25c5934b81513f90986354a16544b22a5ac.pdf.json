    "abstractText": "The chemical equilibrium distribution of 69 elements between gas and melt is modeled for bulk silicate Earth (BSE) material over a wide P \u2013 T range (1000 \u2013 4500 K, 10-6 \u2013 102 bar). The upper pressure end of this range may occur during lunar formation in the aftermath of a Giant Impact on the proto-Earth. The lower pressures may occur during evaporation from molten silicates on achondritic parent bodies. The virial equation of state shows silicate vapor behaves ideally in the P T range studied. The BSE melt is modeled as a non-ideal solution and the effects of different activity coefficients and ideal solution are studied. The results presented are 50% condensation temperatures, major gas species of each element, and the pressure and temperature dependent oxygen fugacity (fO2) of dry and wet BSE material. The dry BSE model has no water because it excludes hydrogen; it also excludes the volatile elements (C, N, F, Cl, Br, I, S, Se, Te). The wet BSE model has water because it includes hydrogen; it also includes the other volatiles. Some key conclusions include the following: (1) much higher condensation temperatures in silicate vapor than in solar composition gas at the same total pressure due to the higher metallicity and higher oxygen fugacity of silicate vapor (cf. Fegley et al. 2020), (2) a different condensation sequence in silicate vapor than in solar composition gas, (3) good agreement between different activity coefficient models except for the alkali elements, which show the largest differences between models, (4) agreement, where overlap exists, with prior published silicate vapor condensation calculations (e.g., Canup et al. 2015, Lock et al. 2018, Wang et al. 2019), (5) condensation of Re, Mo, W, Ru, Os oxides instead of metals over the entire P \u2013 T range, (6) a stability field for Ni-rich metal as reported by Lock et al. (2018), (7) agreement between ideal solution (from this work and from Lock et al. 2018) and real solution condensation temperatures for elements with minor deviations from ideality in the oxide melt, (8) similar 50% condensation temperatures, within a few degrees, in the dry and wet BSE models for the major elements Al, Ca, Fe, Mg, Si, and the minor elements Co, Cr, Li, Mn, Ti, V, and (9) much lower 50% condensation temperatures for elements such as B, Cu, K, Na, Pb, Rb, which form",

The latter results are preliminary because the solubilities and activities of volatile elements in silicate melts are not well known, but must be considered for the correct equilibrium distribution, 50% condensation temperatures and mass balance of halide (F, Cl, Br, I), hydrogen, sulfur, selenium and tellurium bearing species between silicate melt and vapor.\n1. Introduction The chemistry of hot silicate vapor is important for several reasons yet is little known. For example, the ongoing debate about nebular versus planetary mechanisms responsible for meteoritic and terrestrial abundances of the moderately volatile elements (MVE) and Earth\u2019s volatility trend (e.g., Braukm\u00fcller et al. 2019, Fegley et al. 2020) dates back over 45 years to the MVE condensation calculations of Wai and Wasson (1977) and the discussion of lunar and terrestrial siderophile and volatile elemental abundances by Ringwood and Kesson (1977). Isotopic evidence for MVE depletion during planetary formation, and experimental and theoretical studies of major element and MVE evaporative loss from meteorite parent bodies, the Moon, and Mars after dissipation of the solar nebula are attracting increased attention (Canup et al. 2015, Lock et al. 2018, Jiang et al. 2019, Sossi et al. 2019, 2020, Ivanov et al. 2022, Neuman et al. 2022, Tian et al. 2021, Zhang et al. 2021). Other topics of current interest are the chemistry of silicate vapor atmospheres of hot rocky exoplanets and the chemistry of impact-generated silicate melt \u2013 vapor debris disks in our solar system and in exoplanetary systems (Visscher and Fegley 2013, Lupu et al. 2014, Lock et al. 2018). Condensation and/or evaporation of elements from silicate melt \u2013 vapor is important in all these cases. Geochemists have been forced to use condensation temperatures from solar composition gas as a proxy for element volatility in silicate vapor (Lodders 2003). But there is no reason to expect the same condensation temperatures because hydrogen dominates solar composition gas while oxygen is the major element in silicate vapor. This work models the chemical equilibrium distribution of 69 elements between gas and melt for bulk silicate Earth material over a wide P \u2013 T range (1000 \u2013 4500 K, 10-6 \u2013 102 bar) and gives condensation temperatures for the 69 elements studied and the major gas(es) of each element. This paper is organized as follows: Section 2 describes computational methods and data sources and is divided into subsections that give an overview of the computations, discuss the CONDOR and FactSage codes, describe the thermodynamic data sources for pure materials, explain details of molten oxide solution modeling in the CONDOR code, present background information on activities and activity coefficients, discuss sources for activity coefficients used in the calculations, and use the virial equation of state to check ideality of bulk silicate Earth vapor under the pressure and temperature conditions in the calculations. Section 3 describes computational results starting with the condensation curve for molten BSE material over the 10-8 to 102 bar range. Next is a discussion of condensation of the major, minor, and trace elements in BSE material and effects of variable activity coefficients upon condensation temperatures. Section 4 discusses condensation temperatures in silicate vapor and solar composition material and differences between computed and actual condensation and evaporation temperatures due to evaporation (condensation) coefficients. Section 5 summarizes the work.\n3\nPreliminary results of this work were published earlier in two abstracts and one paper (Fegley and Lodders 2017, 2021, Fegley et al. 2020).\n2. Computational Methods and Data Sources Overview. Different sets of chemical equilibrium calculations for BSE material were done using the CONDOR code at Washington University and the FactSage code at the NASA Glenn Research Center. The FactSage code was also used to compute some of the activity coefficients used in the CONDOR code. The CONDOR code is described and used in several prior papers (e.g., Lodders and Fegley 1993, Fegley and Lodders 1994, Lodders 2003). CONDOR is a mass-balance, mass-action code that computes gas phase and gas \u2013 condensed phase chemical equilibrium as a function of temperature, pressure, elemental abundances, and thermodynamic data. CONDOR includes thermal ionization and non-ideal molten oxide solutions. Validation examples and references to other papers using the code are at the Planetary Chemistry Laboratory website (http://solarsystem.wustl.edu/research/condor/). The CONDOR code was used to compute 50% condensation temperatures (i.e., half of an element in the gas and half in the melt), gas phase and gas \u2013 melt chemical equilibria from 10-6 to 102 bar total pressure for 69 elements: Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs; Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba; Sc, Y; La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu; Ti, Zr, Hf; V, Nb, Ta; Cr, Mo, W; Mn, Re; Fe, Ru, Os; Co, Rh, Ir; Ni, Pd, Pt; Cu, Ag, Au; Zn, Cd, Hg; B, Al, Ga, In, Tl; Si, Ge, Sn, Pb; P, As, Sb, Bi; O; Th, U, Pu in a dry model of BSE composition based on Palme and O\u2019Neill (2014) and Hudson et al (1989) for the 244Pu/238U ratio of 0.0068. Calculations were done with 1 K temperature steps and \u22640.5 log P pressure steps. The dry model excludes the volatile elements (H, C, N, F, Cl, Br, I, S, Se, Te), which will be included in a separate set of calculations called the wet model. This was done because the solubilities and activities of volatile elements in silicate melts are not well known, but must be considered because hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, sulfur, selenium, tellurium and halogens are soluble (to varying extent) in silicate melts. Preliminary results of the wet model calculations for a few elements, whose chemistry is similar in the dry and wet models, are presented here. Elements that are not considered are the noble gases (He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe), and the following radioactive elements: Tc (43) Pm (61), Po (84), At (85), Rn (86), Fr (87), Ra (88), Ac (89), Pa (91), and Np (93). Plutonium (94) is considered because 244Pu is a short-lived (82 Ma half-life) radionuclide present in the early solar system and it is important for Pu \u2013 I \u2013 Xe dating of meteorites and of the Earth \u2013 Moon system (Hudson et al. 1989, Avice and Marty 2014). Table 1 summarizes compositions of the dry and wet models. The FactSage thermochemical modeling software package (Bale et al. 2002, 2009, 2016) was used to calculate thermodynamic activities and condensation temperatures in solution using the modified quasi-chemical model. The liquid/glass solution phase of the FToxid-Slag Database was used. This includes Al, As, B, Ca, Co, Cr, Cu, Fe, Ge, K, Li, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, P, Pb, Si, Sn, Ti, Zn + dilute S and F (Miscibility gap at high SiO2). The core system of this phase is Al2O3-CaOFeO-Fe2O3-MgO-SiO2 and \u201chas been optimized from 25\u00b0C to above the liquidus temperatures at all compositions and oxygen partial pressures\u201d (Bale et al. 2009). Numerous other oxides are included in this database, and it is optimized for industrial slags such as an iron blast furnace slag or a copper smelting slag. The database is extrapolated/interpolated to a separate set of conditions in this study. A comparison of compositions of industrial slags, molten BSE, and\n4\nmolten continental crust shows there is some overlap (Table 3 of Fegley et al. 2020). Compositionally the extrapolation/interpolation is reasonable. For example, Fegley et al. (2016) compared activities at 2000 K for SiO2, MgO, CaO, Al2O3, and FeO computed from the MELTS and the FactSage codes for molten BSE and molten continental crust and found agreement, except for alumina where FactSage gave a(Al2O3) about 100 times smaller than the value from MELTS, which does not include a MgAl2O4 liquid component. Extrapolations in temperature and pressure are more extreme in the present work. However, as discussed later, the agreement between activity coefficients from FactSage and other models suggests these extrapolations/interpolations are reasonable. Thermodynamic activities of the melt components are part of the equilibrium solution parameters in FactSage. Model parameters are from many assessments of experimental data and standard solution models, as described in publications on the database (Bale et al. 2002, 2009, 2016). Condensation temperatures were calculated in the \u201cEquilib\u201d module. This is the FactSage free energy minimizer, which calculates the equilibrium products under a given set of conditions. Using the \u201cFormation Target Phase\u201d option, the module steps through temperature until the selected phase (Slag in our case) first appears. The CONDOR and FactSage codes were used to calculate the condensation curve for the six most abundant oxides (thus the seven most abundant elements) in the BSE according to the compilation of Palme and O\u2019Neill (2014). These six oxides are MgO, SiO2, FeO, CaO, Al2O3, and Na2O, which are the bold-face entries in Table 1. CONDOR code calculations using all elements included in the dry BSE model give the same condensation temperatures as the seven-element (six oxide) model. This occurs because the additional elements are less abundant than those in the seven-element model and do not significantly alter the oxygen fugacity. The results of the calculations and comparisons to prior work are in the Results and Discussion sections. Thermodynamic data sources for pure materials. The calculations for dry BSE material use thermodynamic data for the elements, and their oxides (e.g., the Li-bearing gases in the dry model are Li, Li+, Li-, Li2, Li2+, Li3+, LiNa, LiNaO, LiK, LiRb, LiBO2, LiO, Li2O, Li2O2 and the Li-bearing condensed phase in the code is Li2O). The wet BSE model calculations also use thermodynamic data for any gases formed with the volatiles H, C, N, F, Cl, Br, I, S, Se, and Te (e.g., the additional Li-bearing gases in the wet model are LiH, LiBeF3, LiN, LiNO, LiNO2, LiNO3, LiOH, LiOH+, Li2(OH)2, Li2SO4, LiF, Li2F2, Li3F3, LiFO, LiCl, Li2Cl2, Li3Cl3, LiClO, Li2ClF, LiBr, Li2Br2, Li3Br3, LiI, Li2I2, and Li3I3. The data for the compounds included in the calculations are those tabulated in standard compilations, e.g., the NIST-JANAF Tables (Chase 1998), the US Geological Survey tables (Robie and Hemingway 1995), Schick (1966), and the FactSage and IVTAN code databases described elsewhere (Bale et al. 2002, 2009, 2016, Belov et al. 1999, Glushko et al. 1982, Gurvich et al. 1989-1996). The IVTAN thermodynamic database is the Russian counterpart of the NIST-JANAF Tables and is from the Joint Institute for High Temperatures of the Russian Academy of Sciences. It has the advantage of continual updates that include newer experimental studies that are not in the NIST-JANAF Tables, e.g., Aristova et al (2018) on solid and liquid uranium dioxide. The published tables give book length discussions of data evaluation methods with extensive literature citations (Gurvich et al. 1989-1996). Additional data sources are given in the text as needed when discussing particular compounds.\n5\nMolten oxide solution modeling. Magnesium exemplifies an element condensing as a single oxide into a non-ideal multicomponent oxide melt and copper exemplifies a multivalent element that can condense as two oxides into a non-ideal multicomponent oxide melt. Ideal gas chemical equilibria are used because as discussed later, the virial equation of state shows silicate vapor is ideal within \u22642% in the P \u2013 T range considered.\nCondensation as a single oxide. The silicate vapor - melt equilibrium for magnesium is\nMg (gas) + \u00bd O2 (gas) = MgO (melt) (1)\nThe equilibrium constant K1 for reaction (1) is\n\ud835\udc3e! = \ud835\udc4e\"#$ \ud835\udc43\"#\ud835\udc43$! !/&\nThe partial pressure of gaseous Mg in equilibrium with the melt is \ud835\udc43\"#, aMgO is the thermodynamic activity of liquid MgO dissolved in the oxide melt, and \ud835\udc43$!\n!/& is the square root of the O2 gas partial pressure (not PO, which is completely different). Hence the equilibrium partial pressure of Mg over the oxide melt is\n\ud835\udc43\"# = \ud835\udc4e\"#$ \ud835\udc3e!\ud835\udc43$! !/&\nNow consider how the equilibrium partial pressure of Mg over the melt relates to the\ntotal amount of magnesium in the system, denoted SMg for sum magnesium. The total amount SMg is comprised of magnesium in the gas phase (denoted SG for sum gas) and magnesium condensed as liquid MgO in the oxide melt (denoted SC for sum condensed)\n\ud835\udc46\"# = \ud835\udc46'(\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc54) + \ud835\udc46((\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc54)\nThe fraction of magnesium condensed in the melt is aMg,\n\ud835\udefc\"# = \ud835\udc46'(\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc54) \ud835\udc46\"#\nand the fraction of total magnesium in the gas is thus (1 \u2212 aMg),\n,1 \u2212 \ud835\udefc\"#/ = \ud835\udc46((\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc54) \ud835\udc46\"#\nMonatomic Mg and all other Mg-bearing gases, in decreasing order of abundance, in dry silicate vapor are in the SG term,\n\ud835\udc46((\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc54) = \ud835\udc43\"# + \ud835\udc43\"#\" + \ud835\udc43\"#!\"+\ud835\udc43\"#$ + 2\ud835\udc43\"#!\n6\nThe mass balance sum is more complex in wet silicate vapor, e.g., at 3415 K (the 50% condensation temperature at one bar total pressure), the nine most abundant Mg-bearing gases in decreasing order of abundance are \ud835\udc46((\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc54) = \ud835\udc43\"# + \ud835\udc43\"#$ + \ud835\udc43\"#$) + \ud835\udc43\"#* + \ud835\udc43\"#'+ + \ud835\udc43\"#\" + \ud835\udc43\"#) + \ud835\udc43\"#, + \ud835\udc43\"#($))! +\u22ef\nThe entire mass balance sum contains 28 gases, but Mg and MgO are the two major ones, and all other gases combined are <0.1% of total gaseous magnesium.\nThe variable bMg is the fraction of total gaseous magnesium present as monatomic Mg (gas); this is\n\ud835\udefd\"# = \ud835\udc43\"#\n\ud835\udc46((\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc54)\nUsing bMg to substitute into the expression for K1 gives\n\ud835\udc3e! = \ud835\udc4e\"#$ \ud835\udc43\"#\ud835\udc43$! !/& = \ud835\udc4e\"#$ \ud835\udefd\"# \u2219 \ud835\udc46((\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc54) \u2219 \ud835\udc43$! !/&\nUsing the definition of (1 \u2212 aMg) \u2013 the fraction of total Mg in the gas \u2013 one can write\n,1 \u2212 \ud835\udefc\"#/ = \ud835\udc4e\"#$\n\ud835\udc3e! \u2219 \ud835\udefd\"# \u2219 \ud835\udc46((\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc54) \u2219 \ud835\udc43$! !/&\n1 \ud835\udc46\"#\nThe code calculates gas chemistry for a given MgO activity and O2 partial pressure, which means that SG (Mg) is computed. This is one of the iterative procedures in the code. The MgO activity controls the amount of MgO condensed into the oxide melt because the MgO activity is the product of the MgO mole fraction (X) and activity coefficient (g),\n\ud835\udc4e\"#$ = \ud835\udc4b\"#$ \u2219 \ud835\udefe\"#$ The activity coefficient is unity (g = 1) for an ideal solution. Negative deviations from ideality mean g < 1 and positive deviations from ideality mean g > 1. Calculation of activity coefficients is described in another section below.

In practical terms the Gibbs \u2212 Duhem equation means that changing the activity coefficient for a single abundant species can affect the fraction condensed of other species with similar or smaller abundances. Conversely, changes in activity coefficients for trace species (e.g., CdO) have insignificant effects on condensation of more abundant oxides (e.g., MgO).\nRearranging the (1 \u2212 aMg) equation again yields the \u201ckey\u201d equation for the fraction of magnesium condensed,\n\ud835\udefc\"# = \ud835\udc4e\"#$ \u2211\ud835\udc63/3\"#4! \ud835\udefc/ \ud835\udc46/\n\ud835\udefe\"#$ \ud835\udc46((\ud835\udc40\ud835\udc54) ,1 \u2212 \ud835\udc4b\"#$/ + \ud835\udc4e\"#$ \u2211\ud835\udc63/3\"#4! \ud835\udefc/\ud835\udc46/\nGeneralizing, the \u201ckey\u201d equation for any metal (metalloid) M that dissolves in a multi-\ncomponent melt as a single constituent, e.g., Si as SiO2, Al as Al2O3, Na as Na2O, and so on,\n\ud835\udefc\" = \ud835\udc4e\"$(&)$( \u2211\ud835\udc63/ 4!\ud835\udefc/ \ud835\udc46/\n\ud835\udefe\"$(&)$( \ud835\udc46((\") C1 \u2212 \ud835\udc4b\"$(&)$(D + \ud835\udc4e\"$(&)$( \u2211\ud835\udc63/ 4!\ud835\udefc/\ud835\udc46/\n\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\u210e (\ud835\udc56 \u2260 \ud835\udc40)\nThe code solves this equation iteratively for each element considered in the system. The coupled gas chemistry and melt composition link the equations.

Copper exemplifies multivalent elements that may exist in two different oxidation states with different activity coefficients in oxide melts (Paul 1990). These multivalent elements include Ti, V, Nb, Cr, Mo, W, Mn, Fe, Cu, In, Tl, Ge, Sn, Pb, As, Sb, Bi, Ce, Pr, Eu, U, and Pu. The basic variables are the sum of copper in the gas SG(Cu), the sum of condensed copper SC(Cu), and total copper SCu, which is the sum of SG(Cu) plus SC(Cu). In dry silicate vapor, SG(Cu) has only six terms; in decreasing order of abundance at the 50% condensation temperature (3127 K at 1 bar total P),\n\ud835\udc46((\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc62) = \ud835\udc43'9 + \ud835\udc43'9$ + 2\ud835\udc43'9! + \ud835\udc43'9) + \ud835\udc43'9\" + \ud835\udc43'9!\" However, total gaseous copper is almost 100% monatomic Cu with percent levels of CuO and trace amounts of all other Cu gases at temperatures where copper condenses into the oxide melt. The SG(Cu) expression contains 18 species in wet silicate vapor because Cu-bearing halide, hydride, selenide, and sulfide gases are present. At the 50% condensation temperature of 2025 K (1 bar PTotal) the seven most abundant Cu gases (decreasing order of abundance) in SG(Cu) are\n\ud835\udc46((\ud835\udc36\ud835\udc62) = \ud835\udc43'9 + \ud835\udc43'9, + \ud835\udc43'9) + \ud835\udc43'9'+ + \ud835\udc43'9* + \ud835\udc43'9,: + 2\ud835\udc43'9! Monatomic Cu again dominates but is only 62% of SG(Cu) with CuS (20%) and CuH (16%) making up most of the rest. Of course, the gas phase speciation varies with P and T and this distribution at 2025 K and 1 bar total P is only illustrative. Holzheid and Lodders (2001) found no evidence for sulfidic dissolution of copper, and it was not considered in the wet model calculations.

For example, Mn can form oxides in five oxidation states (2+, 3+, 4+, 6+, and 7+). However, there is a maximum of two stable coexisting oxides with\n11\ndifferent valence states that can simultaneously dissolve in the melt, such as Ce2O3/CeO2, CrO/Cr2O3, CuO/Cu2O, EuO/Eu2O3, FeO/Fe2O3, TiO/ Ti2O3 or Ti2O3/ TiO2. If an element has more than two valence states, the oxide pairs with the highest thermochemical activity are usually the ones that dissolve; these oxides always have neighboring valence states (e.g., 3+ and 4+ but not 3+ and 5+ if 4+ exists). As a corollary, the oxide pair dissolving will also be the one that gives the maximum amount of element condensed. The activities of these oxides can be calculated (provided reliable thermodynamic data exists), but there are no tabulated data for some oxides such as GeO (s,liq) and data for other liquid oxides with high melting points are estimates of uncertain reliability such as CuO (liq). The CONDOR code computes activities of the following liquid oxides of multivalent elements: CeO2, Ce2O3; CuO, Cu2O; EuO, Eu2O3; FeO, Fe2O3, Fe3O4; MnO, Mn3O4; MoO2, MoO3; NbO, NbO2, Nb2O5; SnO, SnO2; TiO, Ti2O3, Ti3O5, Ti4O7, TiO2; Tl2O, Tl2O3; and VO, V2O3, V2O4, V2O5. These calculations are discussed later. Activities and activity coefficients. The Raoultian activity (ai) of a solid or liquid evaporating to an ideal gas is the ratio of its partial pressure (Pi) divided by its saturated vapor pressure (Pi\u00b0) at the same temperature,\n\ud835\udc4e/ = \ud835\udc43/ \ud835\udc43/;\nThe activity of a pure solid or liquid is unity, while the activity of a species in a solid or liquid solution is proportional to its concentration in the solution. The proportionality constant is the activity coefficient (gi) which is the ratio of activity (ai) divided by concentration (Xi)\n\ud835\udefe/ = \ud835\udc4e/ \ud835\udc4b/\nAn ideal solution has g = 1 and non-ideal solutions have g < 1 (negative deviations from ideality) or g > 1 (positive deviations from ideality). Compound formation between two oxides, such as MgSiO3 in the MgO - SiO2 system, requires g < 1 while unmixing into two liquids such as in the NaCl - albite system (Koster van Groos and Wyllie 1969) requires g > 1. Activity coefficients < 1 give higher condensation temperatures than for ideal solutions. Activity coefficients > 1 give lower condensation temperatures than for ideal solutions.

Oxide activity coefficients for bulk silicate Earth melts. There are no experimental measurements of oxide activity coefficients in molten BSE material, i.e., peridotite, at super-liquidus temperatures. This is not surprising given the complex composition and high liquidus temperature of dry peridotite at one bar pressure (\u223c2000 K, Takahashi 1986). The CONDOR code calculations use activity coefficients from six primary sources: (1) Ban-Ya\u2019s (1993) implementation of Lumsden\u2019s (1961) quadratic solution model for molten oxides, (2) the FactSage code, a modified quasi-chemical model, (3) the MAGMA code, which is an associated solution model (Fegley and Cameron 1987, Schaefer and Fegley 2004), (4) regular solution extrapolation of a single activity coefficient value to higher temperature, e.g., see the discussions of Ag, Cd, Cu, Ge, and In, (5) the MELTS code (Ghiorso and Sack 1995, Ghiorso et al. 2002) used for K, (6) consideration of optical basicity and ionic potential in periodic table groups, e.g., see the later discussions of Li, Rb, Cs, Mo, W, Ag, Cd, Cu, Ga, and Tl. Table 2 lists coefficients for the two-term equations giving log10 values of activity coefficients used in the CONDOR code. As Table 2 shows, sources (1), (2), and (4) supplied most of the nominal activity coefficient values. The Lumsden \u2013 Ban-Ya quadratic solution model is described next. Details about individual activity coefficient estimates and the dependence of 50% condensation temperatures upon activity coefficients are in the Results section. Molten oxide quadratic solution model. Lumsden (1961) developed a regular solution model \u201cto calculate the thermodynamic properties of complex molten slags from those of the component binary systems. The essential features of this problem can be demonstrated by a ternary system.\u201d The two key points of his model are (1) a single interaction parameter for each cation pair and (2) regular mixing of cations (e.g., Fe2+, Fe3+, Si4+) in an oxygen ion (O2-) matrix. This is a variant of Temkin\u2019s ionic mixing model, which postulates ideal mixing of cations with other cations and ideal mixing of anions with other anions in fused salts and metallurgical slags (Temkin\n13\n1945, Samarin et al. 1945). The two equations that define the activity coefficient for a cation in the regular solution model are\n?\u0305?/@ = \ud835\udc3b\\/@ = \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udefe/\n\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udefe/ =O\ud835\udefc/B\ud835\udc41B&\nB\n+OO,\ud835\udefc/B + \ud835\udefc/C \u2212 \ud835\udefcBC/\ud835\udc41B\ud835\udc41C CB\nThe excess partial molal Gibbs energy, and excess partial molal enthalpy of component \u201ci\u201d are ?\u0305?/@ and \ud835\udc3b\\/@, respectively, the interaction energy between cations \u201ci\u201d and \u201cj\u201d is aij, and Ni is the cation mole fraction, i.e., \ud835\udc41,/$! , \ud835\udc4121$/.1 , and so on. Although quadratic regular solution models neglect ternary and other higher order terms (Grover 1977, Berman 1983, Berman and Brown 1984) they are often used, e.g., see Ghiorso et al. (1983), Ghiorso and Sack (1995). Lumsden (1961) demonstrated the regular solution model fit data for Pb2+O2- \u2013 Bi23+O32melts and applied it to FeO \u2013 Fe2O3 \u2013 SiO2 slags. Later work by other metallurgists applied Lumsden\u2019s model to multicomponent melts made of various combinations of Al2O3, CaO, Cu2O, FeO, Fe2O3, MgO, MnO, Na2O, SiO2, TiO2, and ZnO (e.g., Richards and Thorne 1961, Somerville et al. 1973, Martin and Bell 1974, Altman 1978, Ban-Ya and Shim 1982, Ban-Ya et al. 1984, Nagabayashi et al. 1989, Ban-Ya 1993). These papers show agreement between experimental data and quadratic solution modeling. The CONDOR calculations use the interaction energies and temperature-dependent equations in Tables 1-3 of Ban-Ya (1993) to compute activity coefficients for Al2O3, CaO, FeO, MgO, MnO, Na2O, P2O5, SiO2, and TiO2 in BSE melt.\nIdeality of BSE vapor. An important question is whether silicate vapor is ideal or non-ideal under the pressure (P) and temperature (T) conditions used in the calculations. Corrections for intermolecular forces between neutral atoms and molecules in a gas become significant as the gas density approaches that of the liquid and the ideal gas equation no longer applies. The compression factor Z quantifies the non-ideality and is the ratio of the PVm product or the P/rm quotient (where Vm = molar volume, and rm = 1/Vm = molar density) to RT:\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc49= \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc47 = 1 \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc47 \u2219 \ud835\udc43 \ud835\udf0c= = \ud835\udc4d = 1 + \ud835\udc35(\ud835\udc47) \ud835\udc49= + \ud835\udc36(\ud835\udc47) \ud835\udc49=& + \ud835\udc37(\ud835\udc47) \ud835\udc49=8 +\u22ef\nThe compression factor Z is unity for an ideal gas (i.e., with attractive and repulsive forces in balance), is greater than unity for an incompressible real gas (repulsive forces are dominant) and is less than unity for a highly compressible real gas (attractive forces are dominant). The equation above is the virial equation of state (EOS), which has a sound theoretical foundation (Hirschfelder et al. 1964, Mason and Spurling 1969). The B(T), C(T), and D(T) in the virial EOS are the second, third and fourth virial coefficients (henceforth virials) respectively. The first virial is unity and is the ideal gas term. The second virial B arises from interactions between two gas molecules. The third virial C arises from interactions between three gas molecules, and the fourth virial D from interactions of four gas molecules and so on. The virial coefficients for reactive atoms and radicals such as atomic Fe, O, Na, and SiO can be computed from\n14\ntheir interatomic (or intermolecular) potentials. Thus, one can rigorously compute fugacity coefficients for these reactive species \u2013 something that is not possible with empirical EOS such as the van der Waals or Redlich \u2013 Kwong equations. The second virial is easily, the third virial less easily and the fourth virial with difficulty computed from intermolecular potentials. A common potential is the Lennard-Jones (12-6) potential energy function j(r) with two force constants s and e/k,\n\ud835\udf11(\ud835\udc5f) = 4\ud835\udf16 WC \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc5fD !& \u2212 C \ud835\udf0e \ud835\udc5fD D Z\nThe distance between two gas molecules (or atoms) is r, s is the distance at which \ud835\udf11(\ud835\udc5f) = 0, e is the maximum depth of the potential energy well, and e/k is epsilon divided by Boltzmann\u2019s constant and has units of temperature. Hirschfelder et al. (1964) gives equations and tabular data for computing B(T) and C(T) for the Lennard-Jones (12-6) potential. These were used to get the numerical values of B(T) in Table 3. The maximum T and P in the calculations are 5000 K, 100 bar corresponding to rm \u2243 2.4\u00d710-4 mol cm-3 (about six times denser than air at room temperature). This low density allows simplification of the virial EOS to the equation below.\n\ud835\udc43\ud835\udc49= \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc47 = 1 + \ud835\udc35(\ud835\udc47) \ud835\udc49=\nThe corresponding equation below gives fugacity coefficients f (see Chapter 16 of Pitzer and Brewer 1961).\n\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b P \ud835\udc53 \ud835\udc43Q = \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udf19 = \ud835\udc35 \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc47 \ud835\udc43\nTable 3 gives values for the second virials and fugacity coefficients for several major\ngases in BSE vapor at 5000 K and 100 bar total pressure. The least ideal gases in Table 3 are sodium and silicon dioxide which are more compressible than an ideal gas (2% and 1% respectively). The other gases for which second virials are known have fugacity coefficients closer to unity. At 1500 K and 100 bar total pressure O2 is the major gas with much smaller amounts of metallic gases. Under these conditions B(O2) = 25.00 cm3 mol-1 and the O2 fugacity coefficient f of 1.02 is 2% less compressible than an ideal gas. Monatomic Hg vapor (0.15%) is the second most abundant gas with B(Hg) = \u221226.15 cm3 mol-1. The mercury fugacity coefficient of f = 0.98 is 2% more compressible than an ideal gas. These small deviations from ideality are neglected in the chemical equilibrium calculations. Many gases in silicate vapor have negative second virials and display negative deviations from ideality. This behavior follows directly from the characteristic temperature dependence of the second virial coefficient B (Mason and Spurling 1969). Values of the second virial B are negative below the Boyle temperature, zero at the Boyle temperature, and positive above the Boyle temperature of a gas. The Boyle temperature is defined by the equation below.\n15\nP \ud835\udf15\ud835\udc4d \ud835\udf15\ud835\udf0cQ7 = 0 \ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc60 \ud835\udf0c \u2192 0\nThe Boyle temperature, TB, is greater than the critical temperature, TCrit. Oxygen is a major gas in silicate vapor, and it has TB = 406 K, TCrit = 154.58 K, and TB/Tcrit = 2.63. This is the same as the TB/Tcrit ratio for a Lennard-Jones fluid (Apfelbaum and Vorob\u2019ev 2009). The critical temperatures are even higher for other species in silicate vapor; 1763\u00b115 K for Hg (Franck and Hensel 1966), and 2497\u00b115 K for Na (Ohse et al. 1985). As mentioned earlier (Fegley et al. 2020), \u201cthe critical temperatures of silica, iron, and silicates are unknown. Estimated critical temperatures for silica range from 4,700 to 13,500 K (Melosh 2007).\u201d More recent estimates of critical temperatures for silica and other minerals are 5200 - 6200 K for silica Si1.1O2 - Si1.4O2 (Connolly 2016), 5500 - 6000 K for NaAlSi3O8 and 5000 - 5500 K for KAlSi3O8 (Kobsch and Caracas 2020), 6240\u00b1200 K for Mg2SiO4 from ab initio calculations (Townsend et al 2020), 7928 K for elemental Fe using a corresponding states method (Apfelbaum and Vorob\u2019ev 2015), and 9250\u00b1700 K for Fe from rapid pulse heating experiments Pottlacher and J\u00e4ger (1996). Using the TC/TB ratio of 0.38 for a Lennard-Jones fluid (Apfelbaum and Vorob\u2019ev 2009), the TC estimates suggest TB values > 10,000 K for constituents of silicate vapor and thus negative deviations from ideality.\n3. Results BSE melt condensation curve. The condensation curve is the highest temperature at which melt is stable and is the boundary between unsaturated silicate vapor and condensate plus vapor. The BSE melt condensation curve was calculated (using the six-oxide model for the bulk silicate Earth, boldface entries in Table 1) with the CONDOR code at Washington University and with the FactSage code at NASA Glenn. The six-oxide model makes up more than 99% of the BSE and is the same model used in Fegley et al. (2016). As stated earlier, CONDOR code calculations using all elements in the dry BSE model give the same condensation temperatures for BSE melt as the six-oxide model. In particular, the absence of TiO2 (0.14% molar abundance in the BSE) and other less abundant refractory oxides found in Ca, Al-rich inclusions in meteorites does not change the results. The TiO2 content of the initially condensed BSE melt is small because TiO2 is more volatile than either Al2O3 or CaO in BSE melt as discussed later. Figure 1 displays the condensation curve for molten bulk silicate Earth (BSE) material from 10-8 to 102 bar and compares the results from the CONDOR and FactSage codes with results from the GRAINS code (Lock et al. 2018). Table 4 lists the condensation temperatures plotted in Figure 1. Linear least squares equations for computing total pressure PT over the melt as a function of temperature [f(T)] or the converse T=f(PT) along the (dry) molten BSE condensation curve from 10-8 to 102 bar are\n\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc437 = 8.564 \u2212 31415.9\n\ud835\udc47\n10,000 \ud835\udc47 = 2.726 \u2212 0.31823\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc437\n16\nThe corresponding equations for the wet molten BSE condensation curve are\n\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc437 = 8.638 \u2212 31503.7\n\ud835\udc47\n10,000 \ud835\udc47 = 2.742 \u2212 0.31727\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc437\nThe results from the CONDOR and FactSage codes agree within 38 K up to one bar with increasing disagreement at higher pressures reaching 278 K (6%) at 100 bar. FactSage gives higher condensation temperatures than CONDOR at all pressures. Both codes used the same model bulk composition and both codes are well validated as described earlier. The differences in the results are due to the large extrapolation in temperatures and pressures from one bar and temperatures <2000 K where the solution parameters are optimized for use. Table 4 and Figure 1 also compare CONDOR and FactSage code results to those from the GRAINS code (Lock et al. 2018), which is a Gibbs energy minimization code developed by Petaev (2009). Petaev (personal communication, 2021) kindly supplied us with tabular data for the 20 element ideal solution calculations discussed in Lock et al. (2018) and earlier in several abstracts at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference (Petaev et al. 2014, 2015, 2016). The agreement with CONDOR and FactSage results is good overall, except at the highest temperatures and pressures studied, e.g., differences are 313 K (6%) at 100 bar between CONDOR and GRAINS. Again, the differences are due to large extrapolations in thermodynamic data. The GRAINS code calculations include He and the volatiles H, C, N, S, and Cl that are only in the wet BSE model. Table 4 shows the wet BSE model agrees even better with the GRAINS code results at all pressures. The wet BSE model gives lower condensation temperatures at the same total pressure because the O and O2 partial pressures at a given temperature are lowered by H, OH, CO, CO2, H2O, H2, NO, S2, SO, and other volatile-bearing gases. As a result, reactions of Al and Ca with O or O2 forming Al2O3 and CaO in the molten oxide only reach equilibrium at a lower temperature where the fO2 of wet BSE material is the same as the fO2 of dry BSE material. The bottom row in Table 4 shows the fO2 values along the dry and wet BSE condensation curves, which we found equal within \u22645% at the same total pressure. The major conclusion from all results in Figure 1 is the extremely high temperatures for silicate melt stability in a system with silicate bulk composition in the absence (or with only very small amounts) of hydrogen. At a given pressure and temperature the oxygen fugacity and rocky element abundances (i.e., the metallicity) are significantly higher in a silicate bulk composition system than in solar composition, i.e., H2 and He dominated, material. Although the CONDOR, FactSage, and GRAINS codes use different activity coefficient models derived from data at <2000 K and have different algorithms, BSE melt condensation temperatures from all three codes agree (within the small differences mentioned above). The highest temperatures involve the largest extrapolations in activity coefficient models and larger differences between the three models are not surprising. Nevertheless, the fact that BSE melt condensation temperatures from the three different codes agree within \u226410% over eight orders of magnitude in pressure and a factor of 2.4 in temperature is noteworthy given the large extrapolations involved in the different activity coefficient models and thermodynamic data.\n17\nThis good agreement between condensation temperatures exists because the RTlngi term and differences between RTlngi terms from different activity coefficient models are smaller than the enthalpy (\u0394H\u00b0) and entropy (\u0394S\u00b0) of condensation. We illustrate this using the condensation of CaO, one of the two most refractory oxides in the initially condensed BSE melt:\nCa(gas)+ 1 2O2 (gas)=CaO(melt)\nThe reaction isotherm gives the Gibbs energy change for CaO condensation\n\u2206\ud835\udc3a'1$ = \u2206\ud835\udc3a\u00b0'1$ + \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc4e'1$ \ud835\udc43'1\ud835\udc53$! !/&\nAt equilibrium between the gas and melt, \u0394G = 0\n\u2206\ud835\udc3a'1$ = 0 = \u2206\ud835\udc3a\u00b0'1$ + \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc4e'1$ \ud835\udc43'1\ud835\udc53$! !/&\nRewriting the reaction isotherm gives\n\u2206\ud835\udc3a\u00b0'1$ = \u2212\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc4e'1$ \ud835\udc43'1\ud835\udc53$! !/& = \u2212\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc3e:F\nThis equation shows the relationship between the standard Gibbs energy change, which is at one bar pressure, and the reaction quotient, which is equal to the equilibrium constant Keq.\nThe standard Gibbs energy change is also given by the Gibbs - Helmholtz equation\n\u2206\ud835\udc3a\u00b0'1$ = \u2206\ud835\udc3b\u00b0'1$ \u2212 \ud835\udc47\u2206\ud835\udc46\u00b0'1$ Rewriting the reaction quotient by substituting for activity with the equation a = gX and using the definition of the partial molal ideal entropy of mixing,\n\u2206\ud835\udc46 /\" = \u2212\ud835\udc45\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc4b/ After substituting back into the reaction isotherm and grouping terms,\n[\u2206\ud835\udc3b\u00b0'1$ + \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc47\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udefe'1$] \u2212 \ud835\udc47[\u2206\ud835\udc46\u00b0'1$ + \u2206\ud835\udc46 '1$\" ] = \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc47 P\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc43'1 + 1 2 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc53$!Q\nOver the 2000 \u2013 4500 K range, JANAF (or IVTAN) data show typical \u0394H\u00b0 values for the CaO condensation reaction are \u2212710 to \u2212670 kJ mol-1 versus typical RTln(gCaO) values of \u2212145\u00b15 kJ mol-1, about 17% of the [enthalpy term]. Typical \u0394S\u00b0 values are \u2212170 to \u2212155 J mol-1 K-1 (2000 \u2013 4500 K) versus typical RTlnXCaO values of 29 J mol-1 K-1, about 17% of the [entropy term]. The energetic differences between two different activity coefficient models are smaller than these between the Ban-Ya regular solution model and ideal solution. Thus, the CaO condensation\n18\ntemperatures are closer as seen in Figure 1. Table 4 and Figure 1 show the net effect of these differences; the CONDOR and FactSage calculations used two different non-ideal melt models while that of Lock et al. (2018) used an ideal melt model. All three sets of calculations give the same result to first order because the \u0394H\u00b0 and \u0394S\u00b0 for condensation of pure liquid oxides are larger than the \u0394H\u00b0 and \u0394S\u00b0 terms due to formation of non-ideal oxide melts. Ebel (2005) and Ebel and Grossman (2005) reached a similar conclusion in their calculations. Melt composition. The composition of the initially condensed melt varies with total pressure as shown in Figure 2. The melt is mainly Al2O3 (more abundant) and CaO (less abundant) at lower total pressures with increasing amounts of CaO, MgO and other oxides and decreasing amounts of Al2O3 and CaO with increasing pressure. As MgO becomes the major oxide in the melt, the amounts of Al2O3 and CaO are diluted by the more abundant MgO. Table 5 compares melt compositions at 10-3, 10, and 100 bars calculated by the CONDOR and FactSage codes. The FactSage code shows the same general trend with total pressure, but the overall agreement is only fair. However, the two codes show the same key point; namely the initially condensed melt at any total pressure is more refractory with less SiO2, FeO, and Na2O than the BSE composition in Table 1. Condensation chemistry of major, minor, and trace elements in dry BSE material. Oxygen. Oxygen, the most abundant element in BSE material, is considered first. Figures 3a (dry BSE model) and 3b (wet BSE model) show logarithmic contours of constant oxygen fugacity (fO2) over the 1500 \u2013 4500 K and 10-6 to 102 bar total pressure range. The thicker dark green curves in Figures 3a and 3b show 50%, 99%, and 99.99% (only in Figure 3a) condensation of total oxygen into the BSE melt, which causes the curvature and fine structure of the log fO2 contours. Grid calculations with \u0394T = 4 K and \u0394(log10P) = 0.10 or 0.16 gave the same fine structure and took several weeks computer runtime because of the complexity of the calculations. The most abundant oxides in BSE material (MgO, SiO2, FeO) condense into the BSE melt within a small temperature range in the vicinity of the oxygen 50% condensation curve and the amount of oxygen left in the gas decreases markedly. The CONDOR chemical equilibrium calculations give the equilibrium fO2 and the fraction of oxygen condensed into the melt. A comparison of the shape and range of the log fO2 contours for the dry and wet BSE models is instructive. Above the 50% condensation temperature of oxygen, i.e., to the right of the 50% curve, the fO2 contours have the same shape and about the same value at any P, T point. The small difference between the dry and wet fO2 values leads to slightly lower condensation temperatures for wet BSE melt at the same total pressure (PT) as seen in Table 4. Below the 50% condensation temperature of oxygen, to the left of the 50% curve, the shape, and values of the fO2 contours are different. In the dry BSE model, the fO2 contours go through a shallow minimum near the 50% condensed curve and then flatten out parallel to isobars. The fO2 is independent of temperature in the low T, high P region at the top left of Figure 3a. In the wet BSE model (Figure 3b) fO2 contours go through a deeper minimum between 50% and 99% condensed and then curve upward with fO2 decreasing steeply with decreasing temperature on isobars and with increasing pressure on isotherms. At the lowest temperatures and highest pressures in the dry BSE model (top left in Figure 3a), almost no rocky elements are in the gas; the O2 fugacity equals the total gas pressure to good approximation. In the same P, T\n19\nrange, speciation in the wet BSE model (in Figure 3b) is completely different with fO2 contours down to 10-16 bar. The major oxygen \u2013 bearing gases are CO and H2O with the fO2 controlled by the water gas reaction\nH2 + CO2 = H2O + CO\nAlthough O2 does not appear in the water gas reaction, the H2/H2O and CO/CO2 ratios each control fO2 and give identical fO2 values. As temperature is isobarically increased in the dry BSE model, i.e., moving from left to right along horizontals in Figure 3a, rocky elements vaporize from the melt into the gas and reduce the O2 abundance in the gas. The more volatile elements such as Au, Ag, Cd, Cu, Zn, and As vaporize at lower temperatures but are less abundant than major elements such as Si, Fe, Mg, and Ti. Thus, log fO2 contours initially show small deviations from isobars. But as temperature continues increasing, more of the major elements go into the gas and the O2 mole fraction decreases. Several factors including formation of metal (metalloid) oxide gases, thermal dissociation of O2 to O atoms, and eventually thermal ionization of all elements lead to large decreases in the O2 abundance at any given pressure. The fO2 contours slope upward with respect to the isobars they originally followed, e.g., compare the log PTotal = \u22121 isobar and the log fO2 = \u22121 contour in Figure 3a. Deviations between isobars and fO2 contours increase with decreasing pressure and increasing temperature. At 4500 K and 10-6 bar, fO2 is reduced to 1.5 \u00d7 10-14 bar by the effects mentioned earlier. The equilibrium partial pressures of the major gases are O (4.4 \u00d7 10-7 bar), Mg+ (1.4 \u00d7 10-7 bar), Si+ (7.4 \u00d7 10-8 bar), Si (4.6 \u00d7 10-8 bar), and Fe+ (1.6 \u00d7 10-8 bar). Figures 6 \u2013 9 of Fegley et al. (2020) shows these changes at one bar total pressure for Si, Mg, Fe, and O in bulk Earth vapor. Major Elements. The composition of the condensed BSE melt changes with temperature because more refractory elements condense at higher temperatures and more volatile elements condense at lower temperatures along isobars. Figures 4, 8a, 9a, 10a, 11a, 12a, and 12b and Tables 6 \u2013 11 show the 50% condensation curves from CONDOR code calculations for Ca, Al, Mg, Si, Fe, Ti, Mn, Cr, Na, and K as a function of total pressure from 10-6 to 102 bar in the dry BSE model. Table 6 also shows 50% condensation temperatures for Ca, Al, Mg, Si, and Fe in the wet BSE model using the Ban-Ya activity coefficients. Except for nickel, discussed later, the major elements are the most abundant elements in Table 1. The different symbols denote different activity coefficient models used in the calculations. The black curves are fits to the nominal activity coefficient model. The graphs show ideal solution 50% condensation temperatures from 10-4 to 102 bar calculated with the GRAINS code by Lock et al (2018). The graphs also show 50% condensation temperatures at one bar total pressure for elements listed in Table 4 of Ivanov et al. (2022), which are the only tabular values in their paper. We also did ideal solution calculations with the CONDOR code. Figure labels show major gases in the region above the curves where each element is >50% in the gas, and oxide(s) dissolved in the BSE melt below the curve where each element is >50% in the melt. Figures 5, 6, 7, 8b, 9b, and 10b show 50% condensation curves superimposed on logarithmic grids of the ratios of major gases for each element. Calcium. Figure 4a shows the \u201c50%\u201d condensation curve for calcium, which coincides with the curve in Figure 1. Calcium is more than 50% condensed where melt initially forms; at 10-6 bar Ca is 68% condensed and at 102 bar Ca is 98% condensed. The CONDOR code calculations use\n20\nactivity coefficients from the Ban-Ya model, the MAGMA code, and the FactSage code (see Table 2). The MAGMA activity coefficients are linear least squares fits to log10g(CaO) values versus 1/T where the g(CaO) values were calculated for a nine-oxide model (MgO, SiO2, FeO, CaO, Al2O3, Na2O, TiO2, K2O, ZnO) of the BSE composition used by Fegley et al. (2016) over the 2000 \u2013 5500 K range. All activity coefficients from the MAGMA code in Table 2 are from the same set of calculations. The FactSage activity coefficients are linear least squares fits to log10g(CaO) values versus 1/T for the six oxide BSE composition (Table 1) over the 2000 \u2013 3000 K range and were previously used in Fegley et al. (2016). All activity coefficients from the FactSage code in Table 2 are from the same set of calculations except for As2O3, B2O3, GeO2, Li2O, PbO, SnO, SnO2, and ZnO done from 1800 \u2013 2200 K. Figure 4a and Table 6 show the condensation temperatures for the three sets of activity coefficients are similar. There is a 94 K range at 10-6 bar between the highest and lowest values (5% difference) decreasing with increasing pressure to a 10 K (0.2%) difference at 100 bar. Table 6 also shows condensation temperatures from the dry and wet BSE models agree within 1 \u2013 57 K over the 10-6 \u2013 102 bar range. The ideal solution condensation temperatures, either from Lock et al. (2018) or those computed in this work using the CONDOR code, are lower, as they should be, because the activity coefficient equations for CaO give negative deviations from ideality in the BSE melt. The ideal solution values are a lower limit to the \u201c50%\u201d condensation temperature for CaO (liquid) dissolved in the dry BSE melt. Ideal solution condensation temperatures are useful because they help disentangle volatility and activity coefficient contributions to condensation temperatures, e.g., for the alkalis, alkaline earths, and the Group 13 - 15 elements. The two major Ca-bearing gases in the dry and wet models are Ca and CaO, in agreement with Knudsen effusion mass spectrometry (KEMS) measurements of molten lunar basalts (DeMaria et al. 1971, Markova et al. 1986) and CaO-bearing melts (Stolyarova et al. 1991, Shornikov et al. 1997, Shornikov 2020). The other Ca-bearing gases included in the calculations (Ca2, Ca+, Ca2+) are much less abundant along the condensation curve. Figure 5a shows the thick red colored CaO \u201c50%\u201d condensation curve superimposed on a logarithmic grid of CaO/Ca molar ratio contours over the 1500 \u2013 4500 K and 10-6 to 102 bar range. Calcium oxide is the major Ca-bearing gas at low T and high P (top left), Ca is the major Ca-bearing gas at high T and low P (bottom right), and the two gases have equal abundances on the zero contour. The irregularities in the zero contour and others in its vicinity arise from condensation of oxygen into the melt (see Figure 3). The distribution of calcium between monatomic Ca gas and CaO gas depends upon temperature and fO2 via\nCa(gas)+ 1 2O2\n(gas)=CaO(gas) The equilibrium constant for this reaction is\n\ud835\udc3e:F = \ud835\udc43'1$ \ud835\udc43'1 \u2219 1 \ud835\udc53$! !/& = \ud835\udc4b'1$ \ud835\udc4b'1 \u2219 1 \ud835\udc53$! !/&\nRearranging, taking logs, and using IVTAN data for log Keq,\n21\n\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc54!A P \ud835\udc4b'1$ \ud835\udc4b'1 Q = 1 2 \ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc54!A\ud835\udc53$! + 6474.2 \ud835\udc47 \u2212 1.650\nThe equation shows the CaO/Ca ratio increases with the square root of oxygen fugacity and with decreasing temperature. Aluminum. Figure 4b shows the \u201c50%\u201d condensation curve for aluminum, which coincides with the curve in Figure 1. Aluminum, like Ca, is >50% condensed where melt forms. At 10-6 bar Al is 98% condensed and at 102 bar Al is 79% condensed. CONDOR code calculations used activity coefficients from the Ban-Ya model, the MAGMA code, and the FactSage code (see Table 2). Table 6 lists the \u201c50%\u201d condensation temperatures for the three sets of activity coefficients and for ideal solution calculations done in this work and by Lock et al (2018). The range between the highest and lowest condensation temperatures from the three activity coefficient models varies from 2 K (0.1%) at 10-6 bar to 19 K (0.4%) at 100 bar. Figure 2 shows the Al2O3 content of the melt increases with decreasing pressure and as this occurs the ideal solution model becomes more realistic and all condensation temperatures approach the same value as seen in Figure 4b. Aluminum gas chemistry is complex. Depending on P and T, monatomic Al or AlO is the major Al-bearing gas along the condensation curve; their relative abundances (Al/AlO) vary from 0.99 to 1 (2159 K, 10-6 bar) to 0.18 to 1 (4894 K, 102 bar). Either Al2O, AlO2, or Al2O2 is the next most abundant gas with Al2O favored at lower pressure and AlO2 or Al2O2 favored at higher pressure. The other Al-bearing gases in the calculations (Al+, Al2+, Al-, Al2, AlO+, Al2O3) are less abundant. Figure 6 shows the thick red colored alumina condensation curve superimposed on logarithmic grids of the AlO/Al and AlO/AlO2 molar ratios over the 1500 \u2013 4500 K and 10-6 to 102 bar range. Figures 6a and 6b show the same trend: lower T and higher P favors the more complex gas in each pair (i.e., AlO vs Al) and higher T and lower P favors the less complex gas in each pair (i.e., AlO vs AlO2). Consistent with our results, the KEMS data of DeMaria et al. (1971) and Markova et al. (1986) show Al > AlO > Al2O over molten lunar basalts up to 2500 K at pressures to the left of the red curve in Figure 6. Magnesium. Figure 4c shows the 50% condensation curve for magnesium computed using the three sets of MgO activity coefficients from Table 2, and comparison with the Lock et al. (2018) ideal solution values. The dry and wet condensation temperatures are the same within 2 K. The 50% condensation temperatures for the three sets of activity coefficients agree very well with each other and with ideal solution calculations at lower pressures but diverge into two groups with increasing pressure. The Ban-Ya and MAGMA results form one cluster whereas the FactSage and two sets of ideal solution calculations form another cluster (see Table 6). The difference is 260 K (6%) at 100 bar total pressure. Magnesium oxide shows negative deviations from ideality in the BSE melt. Figure 4c and Table 6 show the ideal solution condensation temperatures are lower than those from the activity coefficient models, as they should be. Our ideal solution 50% condensation temperatures are slightly lower than those of Lock et al (2018). The small disagreements could be due to different data sources or extrapolation of data from lower to higher temperatures.\n22\nThe chemical equilibrium calculations include Mg, Mg+, Mg2+, Mg2, and MgO; but only Mg and MgO are important along the condensation curve as seen in Figure 5b. Monatomic Mg is dominant at high temperature and low pressure (lower right) while MgO is dominant at low temperature and high pressure (upper left); the two gases have comparable abundances along the condensation curve at the highest P and T (upper right corner) in Figure 5b. KEMS studies of molten lunar basalts (DeMaria et al. 1971, Markova et al. 1986), molten olivine (Costa et al. 2017), and molten MgO-SiO2 (Kambayashi and Kato 1984) show Mg is the major Mg-bearing gas in agreement with our low-pressure results. A comparison of Figures 5a and 5b shows CaO gas is more stable than MgO gas at a given temperature and pressure, i.e., the CaO/Ca log zero contour is at higher T than the Mg/MgO contour at any P. Silicon. Figure 4d shows the 50% condensation curve for silicon computed using SiO2 activity coefficients from Table 2 and comparison with the Lock et al. (2018) ideal solution values. Table 6 shows the dry and wet 50% condensation temperatures are identical within 1 \u2013 7 K. As seen for magnesium in Figure 4c, the 50% condensation temperatures for silicon agree well with one another and with ideal solution calculations at low pressures but disagree with increasing pressure; the difference is 274 K (6%) at 100 bar total pressure (see Table 6). The condensation temperatures using activity coefficients from Ban-Ya, FactSage, and ideal solution are closer to one another than those using MAGMA code activity coefficients. The latter give higher condensation temperatures because the associated solution model in MAGMA computes g(SiO2) <1. Molten SiO2 has activity coefficients near unity with either positive or negative deviations from ideality (Ryerson 1985, Turkdogan 1983) and has a small partial molal enthalpy of solution that can be endothermic or exothermic (Morishita et al. 2004, Wilding and Navrotsky 1998) depending on temperature and melt composition. Figure 7 shows the Si condensation curve imposed on graphs of SiO/SiO2 molar ratios and SiO/Si molar ratios. The calculations include Si, Si+, Si2+, Si-, Si2, Si3, SiO, and SiO2; but SiO and SiO2 are the only important gases and SiO is always dominant along the condensation curve in the dry and wet models. Figure 7b shows SiO is orders of magnitude more abundant than Si in the vicinity of the condensation curve. Unlike calcium, magnesium, and aluminum, monatomic silicon vapor is never important for gas \u2013 melt equilibria. Several KEMS studies show SiO is the major Si-bearing gas over molten silicates at low pressures (e.g., DeMaria et al. 1971, Markova et al. 1986, Stolyarova et al. 1996, Costa et al. 2017) Iron. CONDOR calculations included FeO, Fe3O4, and Fe2O3 with FeO having the largest activity. The FeO/FeO1.5 ratio along the 50% condensation curve varies from 35 (1818 K, 10-6 bar) to 540 (4599 K, 102 bar). FactSage calculations give smaller FeO/FeO1.5 ratios, e.g., 30 (3300 K, 1 bar) vs. 228 (3284 K, 1 bar) than CONDOR. The differences arise from differences in thermodynamic data for the pure liquid oxides and their solution parameters, which are magnified because of the exponential dependence of equilibrium constants on \u0394G\u00b0 values. Figure 8a shows the 50% condensation curve for FeO computed using FeO activity coefficients from Table 2 and comparison with the Lock et al. (2018) ideal solution values. The small temperature coefficients of g(FeO) values in Table 2 are consistent with the small temperature dependence of FeO activity coefficients in CMAS melts (Holzheid et al. 1997).\n23\nTable 6 and Figure 8a show the 50% condensation temperatures for FeO agree well with one another and with ideal solution calculations at low pressures but increasing disagreement with increasing pressure, reaching 230 K (5%) at 100 bar. Condensation temperatures from the MAGMA code are always higher because the associated solution model in MAGMA computes g(FeO) <1 versus g(FeO) \u22651 from ideal solution and the Ban-Ya and FactSage models. However, Figures 7 and 8 of Schaefer and Fegley (2004) display good agreement between MAGMA code calculations and experimental measurements for the amounts of FeO left in vaporization residues as a function of the fraction vaporized for two chondritic compositions (Hashimoto 1983, Wang et al. 2001) and an Apollo 16 lunar basalt (Markova et al 1986). Schaefer and Fegley (2004) found good agreement for all other oxides in both the experiments and MAGMA code (SiO2, MgO, CaO, Al2O3, and TiO2). Figure 8b displays the FeO 50% condensation curve superimposed on logarithmic contours of the Fe/FeO gas molar ratios. Monatomic Fe is the major gas along the condensation curve and Fe/FeO ratios vary from \u224810 at lower pressures to \u22482 at higher pressures in the dry and wet models. The calculations also include Fe+, Fe2+, and Fe-, which are insignificant. Gas \u2013 melt chemical equilibrium calculations for a Type B1 CAI composition (Schaefer and Fegley 2004) and for chondrule melts (Ebel 2005) give similar results. KEMS studies of saturated vapor over molten silicates show Fe is the major Fe-bearing gas and FeO is less abundant (Dhima et al. 1986, Markova et al. 1986, Costa et al. 2017). Titanium. CONDOR calculations included TiO, Ti2O3, Ti3O5, Ti4O7, and TiO2, which has the largest activity. The TiO2/TiO1.5 ratio varies from 6 (1882 K, 10-6 bar) to 0.35 (4778 K, 102 bar) along the 50% condensation curve. FactSage calculations give different values for the TiO2/TiO1.5 ratio, e.g., 33 vs. 0.75 (CONDOR) at 3433 K, 1 bar. The melting point, enthalpy of fusion, and liquid heat capacity of titanium oxides are different in different databases (e.g., JANAF and IVTAN); titanium condensation was modeled as dissolution of TiO2 (liq) in the BSE melt. Figure 9a shows 50% condensation calculations using the TiO2 activity coefficients in Table 2 and comparison with the Lock et al. (2018) ideal solution values. Table 7 and Figure 9a show good agreement between the real solution TiO2 50% condensation temperatures within 110 \u2013 150 K (about 5%) over the 10-6 to 102 bar range. The MAGMA code results are always higher because the associated solution model in MAGMA computes g(TiO2) <1 but the FactSage g(TiO2) values shift from positive to negative deviations from ideality with increasing temperature instead of trending toward ideality as do the Ban-Ya and MAGMA code values. Figure 9b displays the TiO2 50% condensation curve superimposed on logarithmic contours of the TiO2/TiO gas molar ratios. Titanium dioxide is the major gas along the condensation curve, TiO is less abundant, and Ti, Ti+, Ti2+, and Ti- are insignificant. DeMaria et al. (1971) found TiO \u2248 TiO2 and Markova et al. (1986) found TiO \u2273 TiO2 in their KEMS studies; however, these two studies are in the region where TiO/TiO2 \u22651 at lower P and higher T than the thick red curve in Figure 9b. Manganese. CONDOR calculations included MnO, MnO2, and Mn3O4 with MnO having the largest activity. FactSage calculations included Mn2O3 (but not Mn3O4). Neither IVTAN, JANAF, nor Robie and Hemingway (1995) give data for Mn2O3 liquid and it is not considered in the CONDOR code calculations. Figure 10a is the 50% condensation curve for MnO dissolving in the BSE melt.\n24\nThe black curve is the Ban-Ya (1993) model. Figure 10a and Table 8 show good agreement between the Ban-Ya, FactSage, and ideal solution models. Figure 10b overlays the MnO 50% condensation curve on logarithmic contours of constant Mn/MnO gas molar ratios. Manganese monoxide is the major gas along the condensation curve at higher pressure and Mn is the major gas at lower pressure. The KEMS results of Zaitsev and Mogutnov (1995) show monatomic Mn is the major Mn-bearing gas over MnO-SiO2 melts in the 1369-1817 K range at low pressures in agreement with Figure 10b. Chromium. CONDOR calculations included Cr2O3 but not CrO because there are no tabulated data for CrO (s, liq) in IVTAN, JANAF, or Robie and Hemingway (1995). Toker et al (1991) and Pretorius and Muan (1992) give data for pure CrO (liquid) and its activity coefficients in CaO \u2013 Al2O3 \u2013 CrOx \u2013 SiO2 melts, but including CrO (s, liq) in the CONDOR code is beyond the scope of this work and chromium condensation was computed as Cr2O3 dissolution in BSE melt as done by Lock et al. (2018). Figure 11a is the 50% condensation curve for Cr2O3 dissolving in the BSE melt based on FactSage g(Cr2O3) values in Table 2. Table 9 shows excellent agreement between the 50% condensation temperatures in the dry and wet BSE models and good agreement with ideal solution results within 1 \u2013 100 K (\u22642%) from 10-6 to 102 bar total pressure. Ivanov et al. (2022) used the FactSage code and give a 50% condensation temperature of 3346 K at one bar total pressure. Using the FactSage code, which includes CrO (liquid), we obtained a similar value of 3358 K at one bar total pressure and a molar ratio of \u22430.3 for CrO1.5/CrO at the 50% condensation temperature. This is 162 K higher than the 50% condensation temperature 3196 K computed by CONDOR using FactSage activity coefficients for Cr2O3. Chromium gas chemistry is complex and Cr, Cr+, CrO, CrO2, and CrO3 are included in the calculations. The four most abundant Cr-bearing gases along the condensation curve are CrO2 \u2273 CrO > Cr > CrO3. This is the same sequence as Grimley et al (1961) found over Cr2O3 under oxidizing conditions in his KEMS study. Sodium. Figure 12a shows the 50% condensation curve for Na2O dissolving in the BSE melt based on the Ban-Ya model and comparison with similar calculations using activity coefficients from Sossi et al (2019), the FactSage and MAGMA code models (see Table 2) and our ideal solution values. Figure 12a and Table 10 show 50% condensation temperatures from the four activity coefficient models agree within 45 \u2013 190 K (1\u201311%) with 50% condensation temperatures from the MAGMA code values intermediate between those from FactSage (high) and Ban-Ya (low) and better agreement at higher pressures. The ideal solution condensation temperatures from Lock et al (2018) and this work are significantly lower than the real solution values because Na2O has large negative deviations from ideality in binary, ternary, and more complex silicate melts (Charles 1967, Gaskell 1989, Itoh and Yokokawa 1984, Lambotte and Chartrand 2013, Mathieu et al. 2008, 2011, Sossi et al. 2019, Zaitsev et al 1999). The chemical equilibrium calculations include Na, Na+, Na-, Na2, NaBO2, NaK, NaO, Na2O, and Na2O2 but only Na and NaO are important. Monatomic Na is the major gas along the condensation curve with Na/NaO ratios increasing from \u2243 3 at 100 bar to \u2243 104 at 10-6 bar. The KEMS studies of molten basalt vaporization by DeMaria et al. (1971) and Markova et al. (1986) show monatomic Na is the major sodium gas in agreement with our calculations.\n25\nPotassium. Figure 12b shows the 50% condensation curve for K2O dissolving in the BSE melt based on the MELTS activity coefficients and comparisons with similar calculations using the three other activity coefficient models in Table 2, our ideal solution values, and results from Wang et al. (2019). Figure 12b and Table 11 show 50% condensation temperatures from the four activity coefficient models agree within 133 \u2013 385 K with the FactSage values intermediate between the higher MAGMA and lower values from our regular solution fit to the 1673 K point of Sossi et al. (2019). The disagreement increases with increasing total pressure. The ideal solution temperatures of Lock et al (2018) and this work are much lower than those for the real solution models as expected from the large negative deviations from ideality displayed by K2O in binary, ternary, and higher order silicate melts (Charles 1967, Hastie et al 1982, Sossi et al 2019, Yazhenskikh et al 2011, Zaitsev et al 2000a,b). Figure 12b also shows good agreement between the present work and the results of Wang et al. (2019). The chemical equilibrium calculations include K, K+, K2, KBO2, NaK, KO, K2O, and K2O2 but only K, K+, and KO are important. Monatomic K gas is the major gas along the condensation curve with K+, and KO the second and third most important gases. The KEMS studies of molten basalt vaporization by DeMaria et al. (1971) and Markova et al. (1986) show monatomic K is the major potassium gas in agreement with our calculations. Other elements. The remaining elements in the dry BSE model are systematically considered starting with alkalis in group 1 and ending with actinides (Th, U, Pu). As discussed earlier, we exclude H, C, N, F, Cl, Br, I, S, Se, and Te from consideration because their solubilities and activity coefficients in molten silicates are not well known, but must be considered for their correct equilibrium distribution, 50% condensation temperatures, and mass balance. This is beyond the scope of this paper but is planned for subsequent calculations for a wet BSE model. The gas phase speciation over the BSE melt for many elements is similar to that in the saturated vapor over their respective pure oxides, e.g., Ca, Al, Mg, Si, Fe, Ti, Mn, Cr, Na, and K. However, there are significant changes for elements such as As, B, Cs, Ga, In, Li, Mo, P, Re, Sb, Tl, V, and W. For example, the saturated vapor over pure oxides of As, B, Li is dominated by gaseous As4O6, B2O3, and Li2O, but over the BSE melt the dominant gases of As, Ga, and Li are AsO, Ga, and Li, respectively. These changes occur because the gas chemistry of all elements is coupled and (in particular) because the fO2 of the BSE melt is superimposed onto the gas phase equilibria of individual minor and trace elements. This is described in the lithium section below. Activity coefficient models or estimates were used for several elements (Li, Rb, Cs; V, Mo, W) but ideal solution calculations were done for other elements where estimates of activity coefficients in BSE melt were not done for various reasons (Be, Sr, Ba; Sc, Y, La; the rare earth elements REE; Zr, Hf; Nb, Ta; Re; Ru, Os; Rh, Ir; Pd, Pt, Au, Hg; Th, U, Pu). Most of the latter elements are lithophile refractory or siderophile trace elements (Kornacki and Fegley 1986). Group 1 (Li, Rb, Cs). Sodium and potassium were discussed earlier; lithium, rubidium, and cesium are considered now. Several measurements show negative deviations from ideality increasing from Li2O to Na2O to K2O; a smaller number of measurements show the trend continues from K2O to Rb2O to Cs2O. This is seen from alkali oxide activities derived from phase diagrams for Li2O-SiO2, Na2O-SiO2 and K2O-SiO2 melts (Charles 1967), Langmuir vaporization\n26\nmeasurements of alkali oxide activities (Li, Na, K, Rb) in basaltic melt (Sossi et al. 2019), the partial molal enthalpy of solution for SiO2 in Li, Na, K, and Cs oxide - silica binary melts (Morishita et al. 2004), and the position of silica liquidus curves in binary alkali oxide - silica melts (Rey 1948). Increasing optical basicity (Duffy 2004) and decreasing cationic potential (Z/r), which relate to electronegativity and metal - oxygen bond strengths, suggest increasingly negative deviations from ideality downward in group 1 from Li to Cs. Smooth, often linear correlations between optical basicity and log g(oxide) in melts exist for CaO, MgO, SiO2, Al2O3, Na2O and P2O5 (Duffy et al 1978, Gaskell 1989, Beckett 2002, Mathieu et al. 2011). Lithium condensation. Figure 11b and Table 12 compare the 50% condensation temperatures for Li2O computed using the four sets of activity coefficients in Table 2 and ideal solution. Li2O, like Na2O and K2O, has negative deviations from ideality in binary melts with SiO2 although the database is smaller (Charles 1967, Shakhmatkin and Vedishcheva 1994). Sossi et al (2019) report positive deviations from ideality, which is consistent with the known immiscibility in some regions of the Li2O - SiO2 - Al2O3 system (e.g., Konar et al 2018). Nassarella and Fruehan (1992) measured g(Li2O) =0.05 at 1573 K in a CaO - Al2O3 - CaF2 - Li2O melt. Sossi et al (2019) measured two different g(Li2O) values at 1673 K: one for fO2 = 10-8 bar and one in air. The large spread of condensation temperatures shows the poor state of knowledge about Li2O activity coefficients in multicomponent silicate melts. Lithium Gas Chemistry. Monatomic Li and LiO are the two major Li-bearing gases and Li (g) is the major species along the condensation curve. KEMS studies of Li2SiO3, Li2TiO3, and Li2ZrO3 vaporization (Asano and Nakagawa 1989, Kato et al. 1993, Nakagawa et al. 1982) show monatomic Li and the less abundant LiO are the major lithium gases in agreement with the calculations for saturated vapor over BSE melt. But this is different than in saturated vapor over pure Li2O where Li2O \u2273 Li > LiO with minor amounts of Li3O and Li2O2 (Table 1, Sossi and Fegley 2018). The difference arises because the fO2 of saturated Li2O vapor is different than that over the BSE melt and because the partial pressure of Li2O (g) is independent of oxygen fugacity.\nThe major vaporization reactions, equilibrium constants, and gas partial pressures are\nLi2O (s,liq) = Li2O (g)\n\ud835\udc3eG/!$ = \ud835\udc43G/!$\n\ud835\udc4eG/!$(H,+/F)\n\ud835\udc43G/!$ = \ud835\udc3eG/!$ \u2219 \ud835\udc4eG/!$(H,+/F)\nLi2O (s,liq) = 2 Li (g) + \u00bd O2 (g)\n\ud835\udc3eG/ = \ud835\udc43G/&\ud835\udc53$!\n!/&\n\ud835\udc4eG/!$(H,+/F)\n\ud835\udc43G/ = ,\ud835\udc3eG/ \u2219 \ud835\udc4eG/!$(H,+/F)/\n!/&\n\ud835\udc53$! !/I\n27\nLi2O (s,liq) = LiO (g) + Li (g)\n\ud835\udc3eG/$ = \ud835\udc43G/$\ud835\udc43G/ \ud835\udc4eG/!$(H,+/F)\n\ud835\udc43G/$ = \ud835\udc3eG/$ \u2219 \ud835\udc4eG/!$(H,+/F) \ud835\udc43G/ = \ud835\udc3eG/$ \u2219 \ud835\udc53$!\n!/I\n\ud835\udc3eG/ !/&\nSome thermal dissociation of O2 occurs via\nO2 (g) = 2O (g)\n\ud835\udc3e$ = \ud835\udc43$& \ud835\udc43$! = \ud835\udc43$& \ud835\udc53$!\n\ud835\udc43$ = ,\ud835\udc3e$ \u2219 \ud835\udc53$!/ !/&\nNeglecting the minor gases Li3O, Li2O2, and ions does not alter the conclusions. A comparison of the Li2O, Li, and LiO equilibrium partial pressures in saturated Li2O vapor (denoted by the subscript \u201cpure\u201d) and in saturated BSE melt vapor (denoted by the subscript \u201cBSE\u201d) is instructive. Starting with Li2O gas,\n\ud835\udc43G/&$,J,@ \ud835\udc43G/&$,K9L: = \ud835\udc4bG/&$,J,@ \u2219 \ud835\udefeG/&$,J,@ \ud835\udc4eG/&$,K9L: = \ud835\udc4bG/&$,J,@ \u2219 \ud835\udefeG/&$,J,@\nThe Li2O partial pressure over the BSE melt is independent of the fO2 of melt vapor but is proportional to the Li2O mole fraction in the melt, which is about 6\u00d710-6 (see Table 1). Unless the Li2O activity coefficient is >>1, the Li2O activity in the melt is <<1 and the Li2O partial pressure is lower than that over pure Li2O which has an activity of unity. The Li and LiO equilibrium partial pressure ratios are\n\ud835\udc43G/,J,@ \ud835\udc43G/,K9L: = ,\ud835\udc4bG/&$,J,@ \u2219 \ud835\udefeG/&$,J,@/ !/& ; \ud835\udc53$!,K9L: \ud835\udc53$!,J,@ = !/I\n\ud835\udc43G/$,J,@ \ud835\udc43G/$,K9L: = ,\ud835\udc4bG/&$,J,@ \u2219 \ud835\udefeG/&$,J,@/ !/& ; \ud835\udc53$!,J,@ \ud835\udc53$!,K9L: = !/I\nThe partial pressure ratios of monatomic Li and LiO are both proportional to the square root of the Li2O activity in the BSE melt. However, their dependence on oxygen fugacity is different. At constant temperature, fO2,pure over pure Li2O is constant while fO2,BSE for the BSE melt can be variable. For the case of fO2,BSE > fO2,pure, the LiO partial pressure ratio decreases (proportional\n28\nto the 4th root of the fO2 ratio (BSE/pure), whereas the monatomic Li gas partial pressure ratio increases by the same factor. Conversely for fO2,BSE < fO2,pure, the LiO partial pressure ratio increases and that of monatomic Li decreases. The oxygen fugacity fO2,pure in saturated vapor over pure Li2O is fixed at any temperature by stoichiometry and is\n\ud835\udc53$&,K9L: = ! I ,\ud835\udc43G/,K9L: \u2212 \ud835\udc43G/$,K9L:\u22122 \ud835\udc43$,K9L:/.\nHowever, fO2,BSE is not controlled by trace Li2O evaporation but instead comes from evaporation and dissociation of major oxides such as SiO2 from the melt. There is no simple expression for fO2,BSE because several evaporating oxides can contribute oxygen to the vapor phase and non-linear coupled equations for all gas species equilibria must be solved simultaneously. Rubidium. The activity coefficient data of Sossi et al. (2019) for Rb2O in molten ferrobasalt seem to be the only data for g(Rb2O) in multicomponent silicate melts. The nominal value for g(Rb2O) is a regular solution extrapolation of the 1673 K point of Sossi et al (2019) for a synthetic ferrobasalt. This regular solution equation was used because a linear least square fit of log g vs. 1/T to all three Rb data points in Table 4 of Sossi et al. (2019) gave increasingly negative deviations from ideality with increasing temperature, which is unreasonable. Initially we used the published Rb2SiO3 \u2013 SiO2 phase diagram of Alekseeva (1963) to estimate an equation for g(Rb2O) from the eutectic reaction between Rb2Si4O9, Rb2O (melt), and SiO2 (quartz), and derived log g(Rb2O) = \u221215,200/T using data from Knacke et al. (1991). However, Lapshin et al. (2006a) claim the phase diagram is incorrect because they crystallized (and identified via X-ray diffraction) Rb6Si10O23 from glass with the composition Rb2Si4O9. These two silicates have similar Rb/Si molar ratios of 0.25 (Rb2Si4O9) versus 0.30 (Rb6Si10O23). Kracek (1933) published the liquidus curve for the Rb2Si2O5 \u2013 SiO2 part of the phase diagram and he does not find the existence of a tetrasilicate. We do not use either our thermodynamic analysis of the Rb2SiO3 \u2013 SiO2 phase diagram or that of Kim and Sanders (1991). Figure 12c and Table 13 compare the Rb 50% condensation temperatures for our real and ideal solution models. The ideal solution is a strict lower limit although the nominal activity coefficient equation may not give an upper limit to the 50% condensation temperatures if the \u201ctrue\u201d Rb2O activity coefficients are even smaller, i.e., larger negative deviations from ideality. The chemical equilibrium calculations considered nine Rb-bearing gases (Rb, Rb+, Rb-, Rb2, RbK, RbBO2, RbO, Rb2O, and Rb2O2) but only Rb, Rb+, and RbO are significant with Rb more important. Rubidium gas chemistry in BSE material is like that in the saturated vapor over liquid Rb2O because Rb is the major gas in both cases (see Table 1 of Sossi and Fegley 2018). A KEMS study of Rb2O \u2013 B2O3 \u2013 SiO2 melt vaporization shows Rb is the major gas (Lopatin et al 2007) for Rb2O/B2O3 ratios > 1. Molecular gases such as Rb2O and Rb2O2 are less important in BSE vapor as expected from the discussion of Li2O vaporization. Cesium. Little is known about thermodynamic properties of Cs2O-bearing silicate melts. Borisov (2009) measured relative activity coefficients of alkali oxides in aluminosilicate melts and found g(Cs2O) just below g(Rb2O) and a few times smaller than g(Na2O). The existence of two Cs-Na silicates in the Cs2O \u2013 SiO2 \u2013 Na2O system (CsNaSiO3 and CsNaSi2O5) means there are negative deviations from ideality between Na2O and Cs2O in the ternary system (Bennour et al. 1996a). Bennour et al (1996b, 1999) studied mixing in Cs2O - SiO2 - Na2O melts by KEMS and\n29\nsuccessfully modeled their data using the interaction parameters WCs-Si = \u2212232,500 J mol-1, and WCs-Na = 0 J mol-1. The WCs-Si parameter corresponds to log g(Cs2O) = \u221212,144/T. The situation with the Cs2O \u2013 SiO2 phase diagram of Alekseeva (1966) is like that above for the Rb2SiO3 \u2013 SiO2 phase diagram. Initially we estimated g(Cs2O) from the eutectic reaction between Cs2Si4O9, Cs2O (melt), and SiO2 (quartz), and derived log g(Cs2O) = \u221213,700/T with data from Knacke et al. (1991). Then we found Lapshin et al. (2006b) who claim the Cs2O \u2013 SiO2 phase diagram of Alekseeva (1966) is incorrect because they crystallized (and identified) Cs6Si10O23 from glass with the composition Cs2Si4O9. Suzuki et al. (2020) synthesized and measured the X-ray diffraction pattern of Cs2Si4O9, found some discrepancies with the XRD pattern of Alekseeva (1966), but used the sample for low temperature heat capacity measurements and published data for Cs2Si4O9 thermal properties from 0 \u2013 300 K. Cordfunke and Ouweltjes (1993) published the standard enthalpy of formation for Cs2Si4O9 at 298 K. Whether or not Cs2Si4O9 exists, we do not use either our thermodynamic analysis of the Cs2O \u2013 SiO2 phase diagram or that of Kim and Sanders (1991) in our work. Cesium is an instance where analogy to molten salts (of elements in the same group of the periodic table) helped to estimate the activity coefficient. Molten Cs and Na fluorides were used because of (1) the similar VI coordinate radii of oxide (140 pm) and fluoride (133 pm) ions (Shannon 1976), (2) the oxide O2- and fluoride F1- ions are isoelectronic, and (3) ideal (or nearly so) Temkin mixing of fluoride ions with oxide ions is documented for PbO-PbF2, (Jeffes and Sridhar 1968) CaO-CaF2, and MgO-MgF2 (Kim et al. 2012). Lumsden (1966) derived log10 go = 175/T for CsF dilute solution in molten NaF; a small positive deviation from ideality. Based on the work of Borisov (2009) suggesting g(Cs2O) < g(Na2O), Bennour (1996b, 1999) suggesting g(Cs2O) = g(Na2O), and Lumsden (1966) suggesting g(Cs2O) > g(Na2O), we adopted an equation setting log g(Cs2O) = log g(Na2O) from FactSage (see Table 2).This equation gives g(Cs2O) < g(Na2O) from the Ban-Ya (1993) equation for log g(Na2O) in Table 2. Table 13 and Figure 12d show the 50% condensation temperatures and condensation curve for Cs2O using the two estimated activity coefficient equations and comparison to ideal solution. The ideal solution 50% condensation temperatures at 10-6 to 10-2 bar for cesium are below the solidus temperature of peridotite; the same is true for Li at 10-6 bar and for Na, K, and Rb at 10-6 to 10-4 bar. Nine Cs-bearing gases are included in the chemical equilibrium calculations: Cs, Cs+, Cs-, Cs2, CsBO2, CsO, Cs2O, Cs2O+, and Cs2O2, but only Cs, Cs+, and CsO are significant with Cs dominant along the condensation curve. The KEMS study of crystalline cesium aluminosilicates by Odoj and Hilpert (1980a, b) showed Cs is the major Cs-bearing gas. Cesium gas chemistry in BSE material is different than the speciation in saturated vapor over liquid Cs2O in which Cs2O is the major gas (Table 1, Sossi and Fegley 2018). The difference is due to the same reasons that discussed above for lithium. Group 2 (Alkaline Earths Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, Ba). Table 6 and Figures 4a, 4c, and 5 give the results for Ca and Mg gas chemistry and real and ideal solution 50% condensation temperatures into BSE melt. Table 14 summarizes ideal solution 50% condensation temperatures for all alkaline earth oxides dissolved in BSE melt and shows BeO is the most refractory alkaline earth oxide in BSE melt assuming ideal solution.\n30\nThe existence of Be2SiO4 (phenakite), BeAl2O4 (chrysoberyl), and Al2Be3Si6O18 (beryl) suggests \u0263(BeO) <1. We did not try to constrain the BeO activity coefficient using periodic trends because beryllia (BeO) does not have the NaCl crystal structure as do the other alkaline earth oxides. It has the wurtzite structure like zincite (ZnO). Chemically, Be is more like Al than the alkaline earths, and its optical basicity (L = 0.48) is closer to that of Al2O3 (L = 0.60) than to other alkaline earth oxides (Lebouteiller and Courtine 1998). The optical basicity of BeO suggests amphoteric behavior in melts (Duffy 1993, Navrotsky 1994). Negative deviations from ideality are expected for SrO and BaO in BSE melt because of (1) the existence of Sr and Ba aluminates, aluminosilicates, and titanates, (2) KEMS measurements showing negative deviations from ideality for SrO and BaO in binary and ternary silicate melts (Lopatin et al. 2006, Stolyarova and Lopatin 2005, Tyurnina et al. 2005), and (3) thermodynamic analyses of the SrO \u2013 SiO2 and BaO \u2013 SiO2 phase diagrams of Eskola (1922). However, the activity coefficients from the KEMS studies, the phase diagrams, and FactSage disagree enough that we did not use them and did ideal solution calculations for BaO and SrO. The major alkaline earth gases in BSE vapor are Be \u2248 BeO, Mg, Ca, Sr \u2248 SrO, and BaO, which are the same as those in the saturated vapor over the pure alkaline earth monoxides (see Table 1, Sossi and Fegley 2018). Note that Be does not follow the trend of decreasing M/MO gas ratios from Mg to Ba. The twelve Be-bearing gases in the chemical equilibrium calculations are Be, Be+, Be2, (BeO)1-6, Be2O, BeBO2, and BeB2O4. Monatomic Be and BeO are the two major gases along the 50% condensation curve; at one bar total pressure Be is 54.4%, BeO is 45.6%, and BeBO2 is 7\u00d710-4% of all Be in the gas. The BeO gas polymers are unimportant. The BeO/Be ratio increases along the condensation curve to 2.1 at 4894 K, 100 bar pressure. The major Mg and Ca gases were discussed earlier. The major Sr-bearing and Ba-bearing gases along the SrO and BaO 50% condensation curves are Sr and SrO, and BaO. The SrO/Sr ratio increases from 0.40 to 4.2 and the BaO/Ba ratio decreases from 3,400 to 28 from 10-6 to 102 bar total pressure. The approximate equality of SrO and Sr and the dominance of BaO in BSE vapor are also seen in saturated vapor over solid SrO (1575 - 2100 K) and solid BaO (1200 - 1917 K). Group 3 (Sc, Y). Yttrium is similar to light rare earth elements (REE) and we mention studies relevant to REE below. Table 15 gives 50% condensation temperatures for ideal solution of Sc2O3 and Y2O3 in BSE melt. These temperatures are higher than the oxide 50% condensation temperatures in solar composition gas at the same total pressure (Kornacki and Fegley 1986, Lodders 2003). The necessary data for real solution calculations are unavailable. Evidence for negative deviation from ideality includes double oxide formation between group 3 oxides and CaO, phase diagrams for group 3 oxides with CaO, formation of group 3 and REE silicates, and KEMS studies of Sc2O3, Y2O3, and La2O3 in oxide melts (e.g., Costa et al 2019, Jacobson 1989, Jacobson et al. 2001, Stolyarova and Semenov 1994, Stolyarova et al. 2020, Zhi et al. 2018). Evidence for positive deviations from ideality includes high-temperature liquid unmixing in the La2O3 - SiO2 and Y2O3 - SiO2 binary systems (Hageman and Oonk 1986). The major gases of Sc and Y in BSE vapor are ScO and YO, which are the same as the major gases in saturated vapor over pure group 3 sesquioxides (Sossi and Fegley 2018). Rare Earth Elements (REE, La to Lu). Table 16 lists ideal solution 50% condensation temperatures for the REE, which are higher than the oxide 50% condensation temperatures in solar\n31\ncomposition gas at the same total pressure (Kornacki and Fegley 1986, Lodders 2003). The necessary data for calculations are unavailable but non-ideal solution of the REE in BSE melt is expected because REE form compounds with the major oxides in BSE melt, e.g., oxyapatite compounds with CaO and SiO2 (Costa et al 2019), aluminates such as LaAlO3, and titanates such as CeTi3+O3. Different activity coefficients are expected for Ce2O3 and CeO2 and for EuO and Eu2O3 dissolved in BSE melt because different activity coefficients are derived for Ce and Eu oxides dissolved in silicate melts at much lower temperatures (Johnston 1965, Morris et al 1974, Cachia et al. 2006, Burnham et al 2015), but there are insufficient data to do calculations. Group 4 (Ti, Zr, Hf). Titanium chemistry was discussed earlier, and Table 7 and Figure 9 give 50% condensation temperatures for non-ideal dissolution of TiO2 in the BSE melt, a comparison to ideal solution results, and shows the major Ti-bearing gases. Table 15 compares ideal solution 50% condensation temperatures for TiO2, ZrO2, and HfO2 in BSE melt. Zirconia and hafnia are more refractory than titania and are more than 50% condensed as soon as BSE melt forms. Figure 13a shows the ideal solution 50% condensation curves for ZrO2 and HfO2 from 10-6 to 102 bar total pressure. The major gases are ZrO2 > ZrO and HfO > HfO2; monatomic Zr and Hf gases are insignificant. The HfO2 (g) data have an uncertainty of \u00b130 kJ mol-1 and are of low accuracy (6-F class of the IVTAN database). The HfO2 condensation calculations are preliminary because of the uncertain HfO2 (g) thermodynamic data. The necessary interaction coefficients to model non-ideal solutions of ZrO2 and HfO2 in BSE melt do not exist. However, negative deviations from ideality are expected for ZrO2 and HfO2 in BSE melt based on existing calorimetry. Linard et al (2008) measured \u0394H\u00b0soln = \u221220\u00b13 kJ mol-1 at infinite dilution for HfO2 solution in Na2O\uff653SiO2 melt at 1733 K. Costa et al (2018) found \u0394H\u00b0soln = \u221214.07\u00b13.35 kJ mol-1 for solution of 7 mol% Y2O3 - 93mol% ZrO2 in a CMAS melt at 1723 K. Both results indicate negative deviations from ideality but neither melt has identical composition to BSE melt. In contrast, Linard et al (2008) found \u0394H\u00b0soln = +25.26 kJ mol-1 for TiO2 solution in Na2O\uff653SiO2 melt at 1731 K. An endothermic \u0394H\u00b0soln implies positive deviations from ideality, as seen for FactSage g(TiO2) values at lower temperatures in BSE melt. Group 5 (V, Nb, Ta). Table 17 gives 50% condensation temperatures for V (real and ideal solution), and ideal solution values for Nb, and Ta. The dioxides and monoxides are the major gases for V, Nb, and Ta. The MO2/MO ratios decrease from 10-6 to 102 bar along the 50% condensation curves; from 10,750 to 34 for VO2/VO, from 23,800 to 23 for NbO2/NbO, and from 46,200 to 140 for TaO2/TaO. The following solid (liquid) oxides are in the condensation calculations: VO, V2O3, V2O4, and V2O5 for V, NbO, NbO2, and Nb2O5 for Nb, and Ta2O5 for Ta. Tantalum pentoxide Ta2O5 is the only stable solid oxide of tantalum (Garg et al 1996, Jacob et al 2009). Table 2 shows the real solution vanadium condensation calculations use the estimates g(VO) = g(FeO) and g(V2O3) = g(Ti2O3). Ideal solution condensation was used for the other V, Nb, and Ta oxides in the absence of reliable estimates. The existence of stable vanadates, niobates, and tantalates (Kubaschewski 1972, Jacob and Rajput 2014) implies negative deviations from ideality but the amphoteric V and Nb oxides and acidic Ta oxides may have positive interaction parameters (a) with SiO2, like Fe2O3 and TiO2 (amphoteric) and P2O5 (acidic) with SiO2 (Ban-Ya 1993).\n32\nGroup 6 (Cr, Mo, W). Chromium chemistry in BSE material was discussed earlier (see Table 9 and Figure 11a). The oxides MoO2, MoO3, and WO3 are included in the calculations and their activity coefficients are estimated from basicity and ionic potential comparisons. Tungsten dioxide decomposes before melting and neither JANAF nor IVTAN gives thermodynamic data for WO2 liquid. Only liquid WO3 is considered in the calculations, which use JANAF data (Chase 1998). Neglect of WO2 liquid (not in either JANAF or IVTAN) does not introduce errors because O\u2019Neill et al. (2008) report W6+ (WO3) is the dominant tungsten species at fO2 of 10-11 bar in CMAS melts at 1673 K. An fO2 of 10-11 bar is five orders of magnitude lower than the lowest fO2 in equilibrium with BSE melts in the P, T range we studied (see Figure 3).\nThe optical basicity of MoO2 (L = 0.96) lies between FeO (1.00) and TiO2 (0.75). The ionic potential for Mo4+ is 6.15, closer to that of Ti4+ (6.61) than to Fe2+ (3.28). The geometric mean of FeO and TiO2 activity coefficients was used as the nominal value for MoO2 in Table 2. Optical basicity values show WO3 (0.51) and MoO3 (0.52) are strong acids lying between SiO2 (0.48) and Al2O3 (0.60). The estimate g(WO3) = g(SiO2) was used because the optical basicity of WO3 (0.51) and SiO2 (0.48) are similar and the ionic potentials of W6+ and Si4+ are identical (10). The ionic potential of Mo6+ (10.2) is much closer to that of Si4+ (10) than that of Al3+ (5.61). Two studies show g(WO3) is slightly smaller than g(MoO3). O\u2019Neill et al (2008) found the activity coefficient ratio g(MoO3)/ g(WO3) \u22484 in CMAS melts at 1673 K. The EMF measurements of Lin and Elliott (1983, 2001) on Na2O \u2013 MoO3 and Na2O \u2013 WO3 melts give g(MoO3)/ g(WO3) \u22482 at 1200 K. The MoO3 activity coefficient g(MoO3) is set four times larger than g(WO3), i.e., a smaller negative deviation from ideality. Table 18 gives 50% condensation temperatures for real and ideal solution of Cr2O3, MoO2 + MoO3 and WO3 in BSE melt. The real solution calculations show tungsten is the most refractory and molybdenum is the most volatile of the group 6 elements, except at 100 bar total pressure where Cr is more volatile than Mo. The major Mo-bearing gases are MoO3 > MoO2 > MoO >> Mo with Mo2O6 \u2273 MoO at the lowest total pressures. The major W-bearing gases follow a similar pattern: WO3 > WO2 > WO >> W with W2O6 \u2273 WO at the lowest total pressures. Condensation of Mo and W oxides dissolved in BSE melt occurs because Mo and W oxide gases are dominant while monatomic Mo and W are trace species. Along the 50% condensation curves from 10-6 to 102 bar total pressure, the MoO3/Mo ratio varies from 8\u00d71013 to 2\u00d7103 and the WO3/W ratio varies from 9\u00d71011 to 3\u00d7103. Molybdenum and W gas chemistry in BSE material is different than the speciation in saturated vapor over pure MoO2, MoO3, and WO3 (Table 1 of Sossi and Fegley 2018) for the same reasons as discussed above for lithium. Group 7 (Mn, Tc, Re), Group 8 (Fe, Ru, Os), Group 9 (Co, Rh, Ir), Group 10 (Ni, Pd, Pt). These four groups are discussed together because their chemistry is similar, especially Mn and Fe; Co and Ni; Re, Ru, Os; and Rh, Ir, Pd, and Pt. The chemistry of Mn and Fe was discussed earlier. Table 6 and Figure 8 show Fe chemistry and Table 8 and Figure 10 show Mn chemistry. Experimental studies indicate noble metals (M) dissolve as oxides in silicate melts via redox sensitive reactions such as\n\ud835\udc40 + \ud835\udc65 4\ud835\udc42& = \ud835\udc40\ud835\udc42M &\u2044 (\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc61)\n33\n(e.g., O\u2019Neill and Nell 1997, Borisov and Walker 2000 and references therein). As discussed in section 2, activity coefficients of the dissolved metal oxide liquids are needed to compute solubilities. Neither the melting points nor the enthalpies of fusion of noble metal oxides are known and solubility calculations cannot be done. However, 50% condensation temperatures of the stable condensates (either liquid metals or solid metal oxides) were computed to estimate noble metal volatility in BSE material. Technetium. Technetium is unstable and the longest-lived isotopes (97Tc, 98Tc) have half-lives of about 4.2 million years. Technetium chemistry is not considered because insufficient thermodynamic data exist to do so. Rhenium, Ruthenium, and Osmium. These three elements are considered together because they form volatile oxide gases and as a result two competing factors affect their chemistry in BSE material. The first factor is their refractory nature, i.e., the low vapor pressure of metallic Re, Ru, and Os at a given temperature. The second factor is their high affinity for oxygen, i.e., the formation of well-known oxide gases such as Re2O7 (rhenium heptoxide), RuO4 (ruthenium tetroxide), and OsO4 (osmium tetroxide) and solid oxides such as ReO2, RuO2, and OsO2 (Pownceby and O\u2019Neill 1994, O\u2019Neill and Nell 1997). Mass spectrometric and other experimental studies show Re, Ru, and Os form monoxide, dioxide, and trioxide gases (e.g., Hildenbrand and Lau 1992, Nuta et al 2021, Skinner and Searcy 1973, Watson et al. 1991). This complicates their chemistry at the high fO2 of the BSE melt \u2013 vapor system at 10-6 to 102 bar total pressure and leads to consideration of multiple oxide gases and solids in the condensation calculations. Rhenium, ruthenium, and osmium condense as dioxide solids (Table 19). The data thermodynamic data used in the calculations are from Barin (1989), Fegley and Palme (1985), O\u2019Neill and Nell (1997), and Pownceby and O\u2019Neill (1994). Initially the high volatility of Re, Ru, and Os in dry BSE material was surprising. However, Jacobson et al. (2001) found Re oxidized rapidly at 600 - 1400 \u00b0C (873 - 1673 K) in O2\u2013Ar gas mixtures with fO2 \u22653\u00d710-4 bar. Borisov and Jones (1999) found Re wire loops in gas mixing furnaces evaporate within a few hours at 1673 K at the fO2 of the quartz - fayalite - magnetite (QFM) oxygen fugacity buffer (fO2 = 3.6\u00d710-7 bar). Watson et al. (1991) reported that Os metal coatings on satellite optics decayed in low Earth orbit at O atom partial pressures of about 10-10 bar. Figure 3 shows the fO2 at 1673 K in the dry BSE model is up to a factor of 5 lower than the total pressure below 10-3 bar and is about the same as the total pressure from 10-3 to 102 bars. We also wondered why similar behavior was not seen in earlier calculations about refractory metal nugget formation in Ca,Al-rich inclusions under oxidizing conditions (Fegley and Palme 1985). The reason is that the oxygen fugacities in the dry BSE model are orders of magnitude higher than those in the metal nugget calculations (at the same P and T). For example, the most oxidizing fO2 in Figure 1 of Fegley and Palme (1985) is about 10-12.3 bar at 1600 K and 10-3 bar total pressure versus fO2 = 10-3 bar in the dry BSE model at 10-3 bar total pressure. Cobalt and Nickel. Table 20 and Figure 14 show equilibrium chemistry of Co and Ni in BSE material. The real solution 50% condensation curves are computed using activity coefficients from FactSage (Table 2). Holzheid et al. (1997) give similar values of CoO (g = 1.51\u00b10.28) and NiO (g = 2.70\u00b10.52) activity coefficients in silicate melts over a range of temperatures (1573 - 1873 K)\n34\nand oxygen fugacities (log fO2 = \u22123 to +1.5 relative to the Fe-Fe1-xO buffer). The real and ideal 50% condensation curves agree within \u226434 K for both Ni and Co with the real solution curves lying at slightly lower temperature due to the small positive deviations from ideality. We also find Ni metal condensation in agreement with Lock et al. (2018). This occurs over a P - T range where the fO2 of BSE material is along the Ni - NiO oxygen fugacity buffer. Rhodium, Iridium, Palladium, and Platinum. The condensation temperatures and volatility sequence for the noble metals are different in BSE material than solar composition material. The dry BSE calculations in Table 19 show Pt is the most refractory noble metal in BSE material except at 10-6 bar where Ir condenses 27 K higher. At 10-4 bar total pressure, the volatility sequence from most refractory to least refractory in dry and wet BSE material (Table 19), and in solar composition material (Lodders 2003) is Dry BSE Pt \u2273 Ir > Rh > Os > Re >> Au > Pd > Ru Wet BSE Os > Ir > Re > Ru > Pt \u2273 Rh > Pd > Au Solar Re < Os << Ir < Ru < Pt < Pd << Au With increasing pressure, the stable Ir condensate in BSE material changes from metal to IrO2 with a range in which metal plus oxide are stable at fO2 values on the Ir - IrO2 oxygen fugacity buffer (O\u2019Neill and Nell 1997). Depending on total pressure either oxide or monatomic metal gases are the major noble metal gases except gold which is always Au gas in dry BSE material. Group 11 (Cu, Ag, Au). Gold was discussed with the Pt-group metals. Copper. Figure 14c shows the 50% condensation curve for copper computed using Altman\u2019s (1978) regular solution model and comparisons to calculations using regular solution fits to the 1573 K point of Holzheid and Lodders (2001), the 1673 K point of Sossi et al. (2019), the 1923 K point of Wood & Wade (2013), and ideal solution. Table 2 lists the activity coefficient equations for the four regular solution models. Figure 14c and Table 21 show good agreement between the four different activity coefficient models and the ideal solution model. The three major Cu-bearing gases are Cu >> CuO > Cu2 gas in all models. Monatomic copper is the only Cu-bearing gas observed by KEMS studies of Cu2O evaporation (Table 1, Sossi and Fegley 2018). The calculations do not include CuO dissolution into BSE melt because there are no thermodynamic data for liquid CuO in the JANAF or FactSage databases. The IVTAN data for liquid CuO at one bar are incorrect, as found during this work. Tenorite (CuO) melts incongruently to solid Cu2O + melt at one bar O2 pressure. Reported temperatures of this peritectic point and oxygen content of the melt vary slightly; Roberts and Smyth (1921) measured 1101 \u00b0C and XO = 0.399 while Kosenko and Emel\u2019chenko (2001) give 1102 \u00b0C and XO = 0.397. The congruent melting point of CuO is not known and estimates include 1228 \u00b0C and 24.7 bar O2, 1278 \u00b0C and 1,268 bar O2, and 1347 \u00b0C and 104 bar O2 (Schmid 1983, Schramm et al. 2005, Kosenko and Emel\u2019chenko 2001). Silver. Table 22 and Figure 14d show a comparison of 50% condensation temperatures for Ag2O computed with ideal solution and two different activity coefficient models. Monatomic Ag gas is the major gas in all models. Sossi et al (2019) report g(AgO0.5) = 0.67 at 1673 K for solid silver oxide dissolved in a synthetic ferrobasalt melt. (Silver oxide decomposes prior to melting\n35\nand there are no experimental data for Ag2O liquid.) The regular solution model in Table 2 based on this point agrees well with the ideal solution model but the second model assuming Ag2O has the same activity coefficient as Cu2O gives temperatures about 140 - 500 K lower than the other two models over the 10-6 - 102 bar range. Prior work on silver solubility in melts in the Ag2O \u2013 B2O3 \u2013 Na2O \u2013 Al2O3 system (Willis and Hennessy 1953, Maekawa et al. 1969, Wakasugi et al. 1997) shows negative deviations from ideality for Ag2O. The existence of Ag4SiO4 and other silver silicates (Klein and Jansen 2008) indicates negative deviations from ideality in the Ag2O \u2013 SiO2 system. For now, all that can be said is that Ag is more volatile than Cu in BSE material and further measurements of the Ag2O activity coefficient are needed. Group 12 (Zn, Cd, Hg). Zinc. Table 23 and Figure 15a show a comparison of 50% condensation temperatures for ZnO computed with ideal solution and the four different activity coefficient models listed in Table 2. The five models agree within \u226472 K. The FactSage and MAGMA code models agree with one another better than with the other two real solution models. This is plausibly due to using BSE composition for these two models versus a CAS eutectic melt (Reyes and Gaskell 1983) and a ferrobasalt melt (Sossi et al. 2019). But all models give 50% condensation temperatures within a few percent of each other. Figure 15a also shows 50% condensation temperatures calculated by Wang et al. (2019) and they agree well with the present work. Monatomic Zn is the major Zn-bearing gas in saturated BSE vapor over the 10-6 to 102 bar range, in agreement with KEMS studies showing \u2264 0.1% ZnO in the saturated vapor over pure ZnO (Wriedt 1987a). Cadmium. Table 24 and Figure 15b compare 50% condensation temperatures for CdO computed with ideal and real solution models. The real solution model has negative deviations from ideality and always lies above the ideal solution model. Sossi et al. (2019) report g(CdO) = 0.15 at 1400 \u00b0C for CdO dissolved in a synthetic ferrobasalt melt. Assuming regular solution behavior, their datum yields log g(CdO) = \u22121378.5/T. Two arguments support a negative deviation from ideality for CdO. The larger optical basicity (1.12 for CdO vs 0.92 for ZnO) and smaller ionic potential (2.10 for Cd2+ vs 2.70 for Zn2+) suggest CdO is a stronger base than ZnO with larger negative interaction parameters. Second, the CdF2 \u2013 CaF2 cigar-shaped phase diagram (O\u2019Horo and White 1971) would have a different topology if g(CdF2) was significantly different than g(CaF2) and would look like those for the CdF2 \u2013 ZnF2 or CdF2 \u2013 PbF2 systems. Using the fluoride as a proxy for the oxide suggests CdO, like CaO, should display negative deviations from ideality in oxide melts. Monatomic Cd is the major Cd-bearing gas in agreement with vaporization studies done by KEMS and other methods (Wriedt 1987b). Mercury. Mercury stays in the gas as Hg (g) and does not condense into BSE melt. Condensation temperatures were computed using extrapolations of log10 a(HgO) vs. 1/T from the higher temperature CONDOR code results. Mercury (II) oxide condenses at higher temperature than Hg and the temperatures for initial condensation of HgO (aHgO = 1) are:\nlog PT \u22126 \u22124 \u22122 0 2 T/K 339 393 468 579 758\nMercury is the most volatile element in BSE material and in solar composition material.\n36\nGroup 13 (B, Al, Ga, In, Tl). Aluminum was discussed earlier; see the results in Table 7 and Figures 4b and 6. Group 13 elements, except for thallium, are more stable as sesquioxides M2O3 than suboxides M2O, and are acidic or amphoteric in oxide melts. Boric oxide B2O3 is a strong acid and lead borate (2PbO\uff65B2O3) is a solvent used for high-temperature molten oxide calorimetry (Navrotsky 1977). Optical basicity L increases, acidity decreases, and cation ionic potential Z/r decreases down group 13; the values are B2O3 Al2O3 Ga2O3 In2O3 L 0.42 0.60 0.71 1.25 Z/r 11.1 5.56 4.84 3.70 (Duffy 2004, 2005, Shannon 1976). This trend suggests larger negative interaction parameters and larger negative deviations from ideality down the group, which is seen from the activity coefficients of 0.28 \u2013 0.37 (1573 \u2013 1773 K) for AlO1.5 and 0.02 (1923 K) for InO1.5 in CMAS melts (Table 2, Sossi and Fegley 2018). However, the activity coefficients of Group 13 oxides in silicate melts are poorly known and need more study. Boron. Table 25 and Figure 16a show 50% condensation temperatures for boron as B2O3 for real and ideal solution models. The black line in Figure 16a is computed with the FactSage activity coefficient in Table 2; the ideal solution condensation temperatures are much lower as seen in Figure 16a and Table 25. Boron gas chemistry is complex. The major gases are alkali metaborates (MBO2 with M = Na, K, Rb, Cs) > BO2 > BO > B2O3 >> B over the 10-6 to 102 bar range. Lithium metaborate is not an important gas because lithium is fully condensed in the BSE melt at temperatures where boron is 50% condensed. Gallium. Table 25 and Figure 16b show 50% condensation temperatures for Ga2O3 for real and ideal solution in BSE melt. The existence of gallium analogs of albite (NaGaSiO3) and anorthite (CaAlGaSi2O8) and metal \u2013 silicate partitioning experiments indicate Ga2O3 displays negative deviations from ideality in silicate melts (Goldsmith 1950, Capobianco et al 1999) despite positive deviations from ideality in the Ga2O3 - SiO2 binary (Glasser 1959). The logarithm of the Ga2O3 activity coefficient log g(Ga2O3) is interpolated from the logarithms of activity coefficient values for Al2O3 and In2O3 as a function of optical basicity (Table 2). The major Ga-bearing gases in saturated BSE vapor are Ga > GaO > Ga2O over the 10-6 to 102 bar range, while Ga2O is the major Ga-bearing gas in the saturated vapor over pure Ga2O3 (Table 1, Sossi and Fegley 2018). The different speciation arises for the same reasons discussed above for lithium. Indium. Table 25 and Figure 16c show 50% condensation temperatures for ideal and real solution of indium in BSE melt. CONDOR calculations used two real solution models; one is a regular solution fit to the 1923 K point of Wood and Wade (2013) and the other one sets the In2O3 activity coefficient equal to the FactSage value for Al2O3 (see Table 2). The differences between the 50% condensation temperatures from the two real solution models are 13 \u2013 62 K while the ideal solution temperatures are 150 \u2013 640 K lower than the real solution values. The major In-bearing gases in saturated BSE vapor are In > InO > In2O over the 10-6 to 102 bar range. Several KEMS studies show In2O is the major In-bearing gas in the saturated vapor over pure In2O3 (Table 1, Sossi and Fegley 2018). The different indium gas speciation arises for the same reasons discussed above for lithium.\n37\nThallium. Thallous oxide Tl2O is the major thallium \u2013 bearing oxide in the melt. This is consistent with thallium chemistry in two other ionic solvents \u2013 water and molten salts. Monovalent Tl chemistry is qualitatively different than that of the other Group 13 elements, which are trivalent, and its chemistry has similarities to alkali element chemistry (e.g., chapter 9 of Cotton and Wilkinson 1972). For example, boric oxide is a network former while Tl2O is a network modifier like K2O or Ag2O. Aluminum, gallium, and indium oxides are all amphoteric and can serve as network formers or modifiers (Reddy et al. 2007). The molten salt chemistry of thallous halides is like that of alkali halides and silver halides (Lumsden 1966). The ionic potential of six-coordinate Tl+1 is 0.67 and is closer to that of Rb+1 (0.66) than to K+1 (0.72) or Ag+1 (0.87). Thus, the estimate g(Tl2O) = g(Rb2O) was used in the condensation calculations. The ionic potential of Tl3+ is closer to Fe3+ than Al3+ and g(Tl2O3) = g(Fe2O3) was used in the calculations. Table 25 and Figure 16d show the results for thallium. The ideal solution 50% condensation temperatures in Table 25 show Tl is the most volatile Group 13 element in BSE material over the 10-6 to 102 bar range. The sequence from most volatile (lowest 50% Tcond) to most refractory (highest 50% Tcond) is Tl < B < In < Ga < Al. Table 25 shows effects of non-ideal solution on volatility; Tl is the most or 2nd most volatile element but the subsequent volatility sequence changes from Tl < B \u2243 In < Ga < Al at 10-6 bar to In < Tl \u2243 Ga < B \u2243 Al at 102 bar. The major Tl-bearing gases in saturated BSE vapor are Tl > TlO > Tl2O over the 10-6 to 102 bar range. Knudsen effusion, KEMS, and transpiration studies show Tl2O is the major Tl-bearing gas in the saturated vapor over pure Tl2O, Tl4O3, and Tl2O3 (Table 1, Sossi and Fegley 2018). The different thallium gas speciation in saturated vapor above BSE melt and thallium oxides arises for the same reasons discussed above for lithium. Group 14 (C, Si, Ge, Sn, Pb). All group 14 elements except carbon, which is not discussed further, are in the dry BSE model. The results for silicon dissolution as SiO2 in the BSE melt and Si gas chemistry in saturated BSE vapor are in Table 6 and Figures 4d and 7. Silicon, Ge, Sn, and Pb all form stable dioxide solids and Pb also forms a stable monoxide solid. Brewer and Green (1957) showed SiO solid is unstable at all temperatures. Brewer and Zavitsanos (1957) studied the Ge \u2013 GeO2 phase diagram by differential thermal analysis and concluded \u201cit is of the simple eutectic type with a miscibility gap for the liquids\u201d. They found no evidence for the existence of GeO solid. The KEMS study of Drowart et al (1965b) shows GeO solid is metastable and disproportionates to solid GeO2 + Ge. Platteeuw and Meyer (1956) showed SnO solid is unstable and decomposes into Sn + SnO2 at and above 573 K. Lead monoxide solid is stable at high temperature (Drowart et al., 1965a). Knudsen effusion mass spectrometry studies show the stable dioxides of Si, Ge, and Sn evaporate incongruently to a mixture of monoxide, dioxide, and monatomic gas with a bulk oxygen/metal ratio of two in the saturated vapor over the pure solid or liquid oxide (Table 1, Sossi and Fegley 2018). Thermogravimetric and KEMS studies show PbO2 decomposes upon heating to lower lead oxides PbOx (x <2) plus O2 (gas), ultimately forming PbO, which evaporates incongruently to a mixture of PbO, Pb, and (PbO)2-6 gases with a bulk Pb/O ratio of unity (Drowart et al. 1965, Otto 1966). The calculations show monoxides are the major gases for Si, Ge, and Sn in saturated BSE vapor and that the dioxide and monatomic gases are less abundant along the 50% condensation curves. The major Ge-bearing gases are GeO > GeO2 > Ge > Ge2O2 over the 10-6 to 102 bar\n38\ntotal pressure range. The major Sn-bearing gases are SnO > Sn > SnO2 over the same total pressure range. Lead chemistry is different. The major Pb-bearing gases in saturated BSE vapor are Pb \u2273 PbO >> PbO2 over the 10-6 to 102 bar total pressure range, with Pb a few times more abundant than PbO, which is never the major gas. Table 26 summarizes gas chemistry at 10-4 bar total pressure for Si, Ge, Sn, and Pb at the temperatures where each element is 50% condensed. The gaseous M/MO, M/MO2, and MO/MO2 molar ratios increase downward in Group 14 from Si to Ge to Sn to Pb. The monatomic and monoxide gases become more important and the dioxide gases less important going down Group 14. Except for PbO (liquid), where PbO polymer gases are important (Drowart et al. 1965), the major gases in saturated BSE vapor are the same as those in saturated vapor over the pure Group 14 oxides. Germanium. Table 27 and Figure 17a show the results for Ge chemistry in BSE material. Literature reports indicate germanium dissolves in CMAS, CMS-FeO, and CAS-FeO silicate melts as GeO2 and/or GeO (Kegler and Holzheid 2011 Mare et al. 2020, Yan and Swinbourne 2003, Shuva et al. 2016). There are no thermodynamic data for formation of GeO (solid, liquid) from its constituent elements in any of the standard data compilations, so only Ge4+ (GeO2) was considered. FactSage calculations give g(GeO2) = 7.4 independent of temperature for the six-component BSE melt, but Sossi et al. (2019) found negative deviations from ideality in a ferrobasalt melt (see Table 2). Magnesia and SiO2 are the two major oxides in BSE melt (Table 1) and the GeO2 \u2013 MgO phase diagram (Robbins and Levin 1959) and activity measurements in GeO2 \u2013 SiO2 melts (Yoshikawa et al 2004) show negative deviations from ideality at low GeO2 concentrations. Unless there are large positive interaction parameters of GeO2 with the less abundant oxides (FeO, CaO, Al2O3, Na2O, etc.) in BSE melt negative deviations from ideality are expected for GeO2 dissolved in BSE melt. Table 27 shows the maximum \u0394T between the five models ranges from 41 K at 10-6 bar total pressure to 155 K at 100 bar total pressure. This is about a 3.3% difference across the entire pressure range. Tin. Table 28 and Figure 17b show the results for tin chemistry in BSE material. The 50% condensation temperatures are for dissolution of liquid SnO + SnO2 in BSE melt. Gurvich et al (1991) give thermodynamic data for solid and liquid SnO and SnO2 in the IVTAN database and a discussion of their thermodynamic data assessment and choices. The real solution model uses FactSage values for g(SnO) and sets g(SnO2) = g(GeO2) from FactSage. Figure 17b shows good agreement between the present work and results from Wang et al. (2019). Carbo-Nover and Richardson (1972) reported ideal solution for SnO in SnO - SiO2 melts (with < 1% SnO2) at 1273 - 1523 K. However, Kozuka et al. (1968) and Grau and Flengas (1976) found g(SnO) > 1 in the same system. Lead. Table 28 and Figure 17c show the results for lead chemistry in BSE material. Table 2 lists the activity coefficients for the four real solution models used. Two of these are from Sossi et al. (2019) who assumed either PbO (liquid) vaporization to PbO (gas)\nPbO (liquid) = PbO (gas)\nor the dissociative congruent vaporization of PbO (liquid) via\nPbO (liquid) = Pb (gas) + \u00bd O2 (gas)\n39\ndepending upon the oxygen fugacity in their experiments. Our regular solution fits to their derived activity coefficients at 1673 K are in Table 2. The other real solution models are from FactSage and Wood and Wade (2013). The condensation temperatures from the four real solution models agree within 8 K over the 10-6 to 102 bar range. The ideal solution condensation temperatures are lower by 10 \u2013 15 K over the same total pressure range. This difference occurs because the real solution models predict PbO has negative deviations from ideality in the BSE melt. Table 28 shows similar condensation temperatures for PbO and SnO + SnO2 dissolved in the BSE melt. Lead is more volatile than tin at lower total pressure but the two are equally volatile at higher total pressure. Group 15 (N, P, As, Sb, Bi). All group 15 elements except nitrogen are in the dry BSE model. Optical basicities of group 15 oxides vary from strongly acidic to basic down the group: 0.27 (N2O5), 0.33 (P2O5), 1.02 (As2O3), 1.14 (Sb2O3), and 1.19 (Bi2O3). The optical basicities suggest less strongly negative deviations from ideality down Group 15 and similar activity coefficients for Sb and Bi oxides. Phosphorus. Table 29 and Figure 18a give the results for three different real solution models of P2O5 condensation in BSE melt and show the result from Ivanov et al. (2022) for comparison. Table 2 gives the activity coefficient equation for the Ban-Ya (1993) model. The equation for g(P2O5) from Suito et al (1981) is\n\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc54!A\ud835\udefe5!$1(\ud835\udc46\ud835\udc62\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5c) = \u22121.01,23\ud835\udc4b'1$ + 17\ud835\udc4b\"#$ + 8\ud835\udc4b*:$/ \u2212 26,270 \ud835\udc47 + 11.24\nUsing the BSE melt composition in Table 1 gives the equation listed in Table 2. The differences between calculated 50% condensation temperatures are about 200 K at 10-6 bar and 102 bar but smaller at the intermediate pressures. No ideal solution calculations were done for P2O5 condensation it displays large negative deviations from ideality in silicate melts. Phosphorus oxide gas chemistry is complex. Knudsen effusion mass spectrometry shows P4O10 is the major gas and P4O9 the minor gas in the saturated vapor over commercial \u201cphosphorus pentoxide\u201d at \u2264150 \u00b0C (Muenow et al. 1970). [Commercial \u201cphosphorus pentoxide\u201d is the metastable hexagonal polymorph, which is composed of P4O10 molecules (Jung and Hudon 2012)]. Muenow et al (1970) found increasing amounts of other phosphorus oxide gases in the saturated vapor with increasing temperature, e.g., P4O6-10, P3O4-7, P2O2-5, and PO1-3. Kazenas and Petrov (1997) confirmed their results. In contrast, the two major P-bearing gases in saturated BSE vapor are PO2 \u2273 PO with less abundant gases being P2O3-5 \u2273 P > P4O6. Markova et al. (1986) state that PO and PO2 are the phosphorus gases in the saturated vapor over molten lunar basalts. The different phosphorus gas speciation in saturated vapor above BSE melt and \u201cphosphorus pentoxide\u201d arises for the same reasons discussed above for lithium. Arsenic. Tables 29 and 30 and Figure 18b give the results for As2O3 condensation in BSE melt. Arsenic condensation was computed as As2O3 (AsO1.5) dissolution in molten silicate and used activity coefficients from FactSage and regular solution fits to the low (g = 0.03) and high (g = 0.56) values at 1573 K for AsO1.5 dissolved in FeOx - CaO - SiO2 copper smelting slags (Chen\n40\nand Jahanshahi 2010). The equations for the three different real solution models for As2O3 activity coefficients are in Table 2. Figure 18b shows the two curves based on Chen and Jahanshahi (2010) lie at much lower temperature than the FactSage curve. This difference could be due to the difference between activity coefficients in BSE melt and the copper smelting slags. The FactSage condensation curve was used in this work. The choice (of As3+) is consistent with literature studies, which conclude trivalent As dissolves in molten silicates (Canali et al. 2017, Chen and Jahanshahi 2010, Hidayat et al. 2021, Maciag and Brenan 2020, Shuva et al. 2016b). Arsenic gas chemistry is complex and Knudsen effusion mass spectrometry (Brittain et al. 1982, Kazenas and Petrov 1997) shows As4O6 is the major gas in the saturated vapor over pure arsenolite (octahedral As2O3). In contrast, the major As-bearing gases in saturated BSE vapor are AsO > As with As2 > As4 > As4O6 much less abundant. The different arsenic gas speciation in saturated vapor above BSE melt and octahedral As2O3 arises for the same reasons discussed above for lithium. Antimony. Tables 29 and 30 and Figure 18c show 50% condensation temperatures for Sb2O3 dissolution in BSE melt. Maciag and Brenan (2020) conclude antimony is Sb3+ in basaltic melts. Activity coefficient data in Shuva et al. (2016) show negative deviations from ideality increase from Bi2O3 to Sb2O3 to As2O3 at constant T, fO2, and melt composition in FeOx - CaO - SiO2 copper smelting slags. Whether this trend applies to mafic and ultramafic melts is unknown. The existence of stable Mg and Ca antimonides such as MgSb2O4 and CaSb2O4 shows negative deviations from ideality in the MgO \u2013 Sb2O3 and CaO \u2013 Sb2O3 systems (Katayama et al. 1987, 1998). Negative deviations from ideality are assumed for Sb2O3 dissolution in BSE melt and g(Sb2O3) = g(As2O3) is estimated in the absence of other data. Knudsen effusion (Behrens and Rosenblatt 1973) and KEMS (Semenov et al. 1983) show Sb4O6 is the major gas in the saturated vapor over subliming orthorhombic Sb2O3 (valentinite). In contrast, the major Sb-bearing gases in saturated BSE vapor are SbO > Sb followed by Sb2 > Sb4O6 > Sb4 along the Sb 50% condensation curve. The different antimony gas speciation in saturated vapor above BSE melt and octahedral Sb2O3 arises for the same reasons discussed above for lithium. Bismuth. Tables 29 and 30 and Figure 18d show Bi2O3 condensation in BSE melt. Three sets of calculations were done: (1) ideal solution, (2) estimating g(Bi2O3) = g(As2O3) from FactSage, and (3) a regular solution fit to g(BiO1.5) = 0.4 at 1573 K in FeOx - CaO - SiO2 copper smelting slags (Paulina et al. 2013), which is given in Table 2. Figure 18d shows the large differences between 50% condensation temperatures between the three sets of calculations. There are no intermediate compounds in the MgO \u2013 Bi2O3 system, but the binary systems of Bi2O3 with Al2O3, Na2O, and TiO2 contain intermediate compounds (Kargin et al 2008, Jiang et al 2021). Consequently, the activity coefficient equation based on Bi2O3 dissolution in FeOx - CaO - SiO2 copper smelting slags (Paulina et al. 2013), may underestimate the negative deviations from ideality for Bi2O3 dissolved in BSE melt. Based on Shuva et al. (2016) cited above, the \u201ctrue\u201d Bi2O3 activity coefficient and 50% condensation temperature should lie between the two sets of curves in Figure 18d. The major Bi-bearing gases in saturated BSE vapor are Bi >> BiO, which are also the major gases in saturated vapor over Bi2O3 (Table 1, Sossi and Fegley 2018).\n41\nGroups 16 - 18 (Chalcogens, halogens, noble gases). Oxygen is the only Group 16 \u2013 18 element in the dry BSE model. Table 31 gives 50% condensation temperatures for oxygen computed using the nominal activity coefficients for oxides in the BSE melt and a comparison to the 50% oxygen condensation temperature from Ivanov et al. (2022) at one bar total pressure. Sulfur, selenium, and tellurium are in the wet BSE model and their condensation chemistry is complicated. For example, the dissolved form of sulfur depends upon oxygen fugacity with sulfide favored at lower fO2 and sulfate favored at higher fO2 (Figure 12 and associated discussion in Zolotov and Fegley 1999). Ivanov et al. (2022) list 2983 K for the 50% condensation temperature of sulfur in BSE melt at one bar total pressure but do not provide details necessary to evaluate their result. The dissolution of selenium and tellurium is also fO2 dependent with reduced selenium and tellurium species favored at lower fO2 and oxidized selenium and tellurium species favored at higher oxygen fugacity. However, the solubilities and activity coefficients of chalcogens in BSE melt are not known and must be estimated using Temkin mixing or another method. The solubilities of halogens in BSE melt are not known and need to be estimated from existing solubility data in basaltic melt at lower temperatures. This work is beyond the scope of this paper. Actinides (Th, U, Pu). Table 15 and Figure 13b give 50% condensation temperatures for ideal solution of ThO2, UO2, and PuO2 in BSE melt. Uranium is most volatile, and thorium is the most refractory. The major uranium-bearing gases are UO3 > UO2 > UO >> U with UO2 (g) becoming more important with increasing pressure. The major thorium-bearing gases are ThO2 > ThO > Th with ThO2 always dominant. Plutonium gas chemistry is unique. The major Pu-bearing gases are PuO2 > PuO > Pu > Pu+ from 10-6 to 102 bar total pressure. Thermal ionization. Thermal ionization is included in the chemical equilibrium calculations as discussed earlier. Figure 19 shows logarithmic contours of the electron partial pressure over 1500 \u2013 4500 K and 10-6 to 102 bar total pressure. Thermal ionization increases electrical conductivity and magnetic fields in the proto-lunar disk, which drive turbulence and bipolar outflows that remove mass from the Earth \u2013 Moon system (Gammie et al. 2016). Cesium has the lowest ionization potential (3.89 electron volts) of any naturally occurring element, but calcium is significantly more abundant with a low ionization potential of 6.11 eV making Ca+ the major cation and major electron source in a proto-lunar disk composed of silicate vapor and melt.\n4. Discussion\nComparison of condensation temperatures in silicate and solar composition material. Calculated 50% condensation temperatures for the 10-6 to 102 bar total pressure range are in the preceding tables and figures. A summary at 10-4 bar total pressure is in Table 32. Comparison of Table 32 with Table 8 of Lodders (2003) shows condensation temperatures in BSE material are significantly higher than those in solar composition material. Even mercury condenses about 140 K higher in silicate than in solar composition material. Two factors are responsible for the large differences. The first factor is the absence in dry BSE material of hydrogen and helium, which dilute the partial pressures of rocky element gases in solar composition material. In other words, the metallicity of silicate vapor is significantly higher than that of solar composition material. The\n42\nhydrogen and helium abundances in wet BSE material are orders of magnitude lower than in solar composition material and the same argument holds. The second factor is the significantly higher oxygen fugacity of silicate material. This follows from Goldschmidt\u2019s (1928) observation that oxygen is the most abundant element in silicates (on an atomic basis). Figure 1 of Fegley et al. (2020) shows the large difference between the fO2 of silica vapor, BSE vapor, and solar composition gas as a function of temperature. The reader can make a similar quantitative comparison using Figure 3a (dry BSE) and Figure 3b (wet BSE) and the equation below, which gives the temperature dependent oxygen fugacity (fO2) of solar composition gas from 300 \u2013 2500 K, which is controlled by reaction of hydrogen with water vapor (p. 33, Lodders and Fegley 2011):\n2H2 + O2 = 2H2O\n\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc54!A\ud835\udc53$!(\ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc5f) = 2\ud835\udc59\ud835\udc5c\ud835\udc54 ; \ud835\udc4b)!$ \ud835\udc4b)! = + 5.67 \u2212 25,664 \ud835\udc47\nPrevious chemical equilibrium calculations by Schaefer and Fegley (2010) for H chondritic material give the same conclusion, significantly higher condensation temperatures in H chondritic silicate than in solar composition material (see their Table 4 and Figures 3-5). We do not belabor this point further and refer the reader to prior papers making the same point (Fegley and Cameron 1987, O\u2019Neill 1991, Visscher and Fegley 2013, Canup et al. 2015, Lock et al. 2018, Sossi and Fegley 2018, Sossi et al 2019, Fegley et al. 2020). Condensation Coefficients and Non-Equilibrium Condensation (Evaporation). At thermodynamic equilibrium condensation and evaporation temperatures are identical. However, not all vapor molecules that strike the surface of a condensed phase (liquid or solid) will equilibrate with the surface and condense (Searcy 1970). The fraction of molecules that strike the surface and condense is defined as the condensation coefficient, \u03b1c. Similarly, a vaporization coefficient, \u03b1v, is defined as the ratio of measured vapor flux to the flux calculated from the equilibrium pressure. Searcy (1970) notes that in non-equilibrium vaporization the condensation and vaporization coefficients are not strictly equal. In practice, they are probably close. Measurements of vaporization and condensation coefficients are limited. Most measurements are for vaporization coefficients. They have been reported for some solid and liquid oxides and range from 1 to 10-2. Schaefer and Fegley (2004) gave a detailed discussion with their Table 10 and we briefly recapitulate some of their major points. Condensation (vaporization) coefficients are less than unity for solid oxides, e.g., Jacobson et al. (2017) report \u03b1v = (2\u279d5) \u00d7 10-3 for SiO2 (solid) from 1800 - 1950 K. This is about a factor of 2-3 lower than \u03b1v = (11- 15) \u00d7 10-3 found by Hashimoto (1990); similar differences occur for \u03b1v values for a-Al2O3 (corundum) listed in Table 10 of Schaefer and Fegley (2004). Burns (1966) found \u03b1v = 1 for liquid Al2O3, Ga2O3, and In2O3 at their melting points. However, Hashimoto (1990) reported vaporization coefficients less than unity for liquid silica and liquid Mg2SiO4. Shornikov (2015) estimated the following values for these solid rock-forming oxides: 0.66\u00b10.15 (CaO), 0.50\u00b10.20 (MgO), 0.33\u00b10.02 (Al2O3), 0.23\u00b10.02 (TiO2), (2.2\u00b10.3) \u00d710-2 (SiO2), and values of unity for all the liquid oxides.\n43\nMore experimental data is needed to confirm or refute values of unity for all liquid oxides. The preceding discussion is only for pure solid compounds. There are limited measurements of vaporization coefficients for specific components of complex melts (e.g., Richter et al. 2002, 2007). These are determined by taking the measured vapor flux from a free surface and comparing it to the calculated equilibrium flux using solution models (e.g., Berman 1983, Berman and Brown 1984). Richter et al. (2002) report vaporization coefficients from CAI-like melts for Mg and SiO ranging from 0.1 to 0.2. There is some correlation with increasing MgO content leading to larger vaporization coefficients. In their calculation of evaporation of forsterite, Tsuchiyama et al. (1999) use a vaporization coefficient of 0.1. The value of the vaporization coefficient for a particular species such as Mg or SiO depends upon the calculated activity coefficient for the parent species in the melt (e.g., MgO, SiO2). As shown in Table 2 and in figures throughout this paper, different melt models give different values for activity coefficients and thus different equilibrium flux values. The \u201ctrue\u201d values of vaporization coefficients from multicomponent melts are not yet known. If condensation coefficients for oxide dissolution in BSE melt are less than unity the condensing flux would be reduced, and the \u201ctrue\u201d 50% condensation temperature would be higher. In the absence of constraints on condensation coefficients we assume they are unity, as done by other authors (Canup et al. 2015, Lock et al. 2018, Wang et al. 2019, Ivanov et al. 2022).\n5. Summary\nThe gas \u2013 melt chemistry of bulk silicate Earth (BSE) material was modeled using ideal\ngas, non-ideal melt chemical equilibrium calculations over the 1000 \u2013 4500 K temperature range and 10-6 to 102 bar pressure range. The virial equation of state was used to verify the near ideality of silicate vapor (within 2%) in this pressure \u2013 temperature range. The effects of different activity coefficients and ideal solution upon the results were studied. The results presented are 50% condensation temperatures, major gases of each element, and the pressure and temperature dependent oxygen fugacity (fO2) of dry and wet BSE material. The dry BSE model has no water because it excludes hydrogen; it also excludes the volatile elements (C, N, F, Cl, Br, I, S, Se, Te). The wet BSE model has water because it includes hydrogen; it also includes the other volatiles. Key conclusions include the following: (1) much higher condensation temperatures in silicate vapor than in solar composition gas at the same total pressure because of the higher total metallicity and higher oxygen fugacity of silicate vapor, (2) a different condensation sequence in silicate vapor than in solar composition gas, (3) good agreement between different activity coefficient models except for the alkali elements, which show the largest differences between models, (4) agreement, where overlap exists, with published silicate vapor condensation calculations (e.g., Canup et al. 2015, Lock et al. 2018, Wang et al. 2019), (5) condensation of Mo and W oxides instead of metals, (6) a stability field for Ni metal as reported by Lock et al. (2018), (7) agreement between ideal solution (from this work and from Lock et al. 2018) and real solution condensation temperatures for elements with minor deviations from ideality in the oxide melt, (8) similar 50% condensation temperatures, within a few degrees, in the dry and wet BSE models for Al, Ca, Co, Cr, Fe, Li, Mg, Mn, Si, Ti, V, and (9) much lower 50% condensation temperatures for elements such as B, Cu, K, Na, Pb, Rb, which form halide, hydroxide, sulfide, selenide, telluride and oxyhalide gases. The latter results are preliminary\n44\nbecause solubilities and activities of volatile elements in silicate melts are not well known, but must be used for the correct equilibrium distribution, 50% condensation temperatures and mass balance of halide (F, Cl, Br, I), hydrogen, sulfur, selenium and tellurium bearing species between silicate melt and vapor.\nAcknowledgments\nEven though we chose a different journal for publication, we thank Sasha Krot for contacting us in October 2020 about authoring a paper in Meteoritics and Planetary Science (MAPS) in memory of John Wasson, whom BF and KL knew for many years.
