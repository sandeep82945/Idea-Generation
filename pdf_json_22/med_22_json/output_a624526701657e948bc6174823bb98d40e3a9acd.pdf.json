    "abstractText": "Purpose: Investigate the correlation and agreement between the results of semiautomated and fully automated quantitative analysis of the corneal sub-basal nerve plexus (SNP) in patients with dry eye disease (DED) with ocular pain using in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM). Method: A total of 50 voluntary participants were enrolled in this study, i.e., 25 DED patients with ocular pain and 25 healthy controls. Each patient underwent an evaluation of ocular symptoms that utilized: the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI), the Ocular Pain Assessment Survey (OPAS), the tear film breakup time (TBUT) test, the Schirmer test, corneal staining, and IVCM. Five SNP images of the cornea of each eye were selected and analyzed using a semiautomated analysis software (NeuronJ) and a fully automated method (ACCMetrics) to quantify corneal nerve fiber density (CNFD), corneal nerve branch density (CNBD), and corneal nerve fiber length (CNFL). Results: The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of the CNFD (0.460 [0.382\u20130.532], p < 0.001), CNBD (0.608 [0.545\u20130.665], p < 0.001), and CNFL (0.851 [0.822\u20130.875], p < 0.001) represents the repeatability and consistency of measurements by the NeuronJ and ACCMetrics software. The CNFL values (r = 0.881, p < 0.001) obtained using the two methods have extremely high correlation, and similarly, the CNFD values (r = 0.669, p < 0.001) and CNBD values (r = 0.703, p < 0.001) are highly correlated. The CNFL had the biggest area under the curve (AUC; 0.747 [0.700\u20130.793], p< 0.001) when using ACCMetrics. In DED patients with ocular pain, the mean CNFD values for semiautomated and fully automated quantization were 23.5 \u00b1 8.1 and 23.8 \u00b1 8.6 n/mm2; the mean CNBD values were 46.0 \u00b1 21.3, 35.7 \u00b1 23.3 n/mm2; and the mean CNFL values were 19.3\u00b1 4.3 and 15.2\u00b1 3.8 mm/mm2, which were significantly lower than healthy subjects (p < 0.001). Conclusion: There is a significant correlation between the measurements obtained via ACCMetrics and NeuronJ, especially for CNFL, which can be considered as the primary indicator in the diagnosis of DED with ocular pain. The SNP of the disease was significantly lower than that of healthy subjects.",

Each patient underwent an evaluation\nof ocular symptoms that utilized: the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI), the Ocular\nPain Assessment Survey (OPAS), the tear film breakup time (TBUT) test, the Schirmer\ntest, corneal staining, and IVCM. Five SNP images of the cornea of each eye were\nselected and analyzed using a semiautomated analysis software (NeuronJ) and a fully\nautomated method (ACCMetrics) to quantify corneal nerve fiber density (CNFD), corneal\nnerve branch density (CNBD), and corneal nerve fiber length (CNFL).\nResults: The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) of the CNFD (0.460 [0.382\u20130.532],\np < 0.001), CNBD (0.608 [0.545\u20130.665], p < 0.001), and CNFL (0.851 [0.822\u20130.875], p\n< 0.001) represents the repeatability and consistency of measurements by the NeuronJ\nand ACCMetrics software. The CNFL values (r = 0.881, p < 0.001) obtained using the\ntwo methods have extremely high correlation, and similarly, the CNFD values (r = 0.669,\np < 0.001) and CNBD values (r = 0.703, p < 0.001) are highly correlated. The CNFL\nhad the biggest area under the curve (AUC; 0.747 [0.700\u20130.793], p< 0.001) when using\nACCMetrics. In DED patients with ocular pain, the mean CNFD values for semiautomated and fully automated quantization were 23.5 \u00b1 8.1 and 23.8 \u00b1 8.6 n/mm2; the mean CNBD values were 46.0 \u00b1 21.3, 35.7 \u00b1 23.3 n/mm2; and the mean CNFL values were 19.3\u00b1 4.3 and 15.2\u00b1 3.8 mm/mm2, which were significantly lower than healthy subjects\n(p < 0.001).\nConclusion: There is a significant correlation between the measurements obtained\nvia ACCMetrics and NeuronJ, especially for CNFL, which can be considered as the\nprimary indicator in the diagnosis of DED with ocular pain. The SNP of the disease was\nsignificantly lower than that of healthy subjects.\nKeywords: dry eye disease, ocular pain, in vivo confocal microscopy, corneal subbasal nerve plexus, NeuronJ, ACCMetrics"

            "text": "Dry eye disease (DED) is one of the most often reported ocular diseases, with a global incidence of 5\u201350% by symptoms (1\u2013 3). Ocular surface inflammation and injury, tear film instability, hyperosmolarity, and neurosensory abnormalities are all factors that contribute to DED, as defined by the International Dry Eye Workshop in 2017 (4). Along with abnormalities of the tear film and ocular surface, the revised DED criteria include neurosensory dysfunction as a contributing component. Ocular pain, such as burning, aching, and itching, is a frequent symptom of moderate-to-severe DED. It is commonly accepted that DED combined with ocular pain alters the structure and function of the ocular surface\u2019s sensory nerves, resulting in the appearance of unpleasant sensations ranging frommild discomfort and dryness to scorching pain (5).\nWith an abundant supply of nerve fibers, the cornea is one of the most highly innervated tissues in the body. The human cornea is filled with sensory nerve fibers originating from the trigeminal nerve\u2019s ophthalmic branch and sympathetic and parasympathetic nerve fibers. Nerve fibers in the human cornea flow radially from the periphery of the anterior part of the stroma to its center. These nerve fibers penetrate the Bowman\u2019s layer and then branch vertically and horizontally between the epithelium of the Bowman\u2019s layer and the basal epithelium to create a network of nerve fibers known as the sub-basal nerve plexus (SNP) (6). Numerous scientific investigations have been conducted on the corneal nerve\u2019s structural and functional anomalies in the setting of a range of ocular and systemic illnesses (7).\nCorneal in vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) is a noninvasive technique for obtaining high-resolution images of the SNP at the cellular level with image quality equivalent to that obtained using histochemical techniques. Oliveira-Soto and Efron were the first to utilize IVCM to describe corneal nerves (8). Previous research has revealed variations in the morphology of the corneal nerves in patients having DED, such as considerably decreased nerve density and relatively high reflectivity, beading, and tortuosity. Shetty et al. observed a substantial reduction in SNP characteristics (corneal nerve fiber length [CNFL], fiber density, fiber width, total branch density, nerve branch density, and fiber area) in DED with ocular pain patients (9). YavuzSaricay et al. discovered a significant decrease in main and branch nerve densities, an increase in dendritic cell density, and the existence of microneuromas in DED patients with ocular pain (10).\nNotwithstanding the growing use of IVCM in DED clinical practice, there have only been a few pertinent advances in available software tools that facilitate automated corneal nerve analysis. To date, the majority of IVCM image analyses of corneal nerves have been performed manually or semiautomatically, which has a lot of drawbacks, such as being time-consuming, subjective, prone to observer bias, and having low repeatability and consistency (6). According to the latest the dry eye workShop II (DEWS II) of the tear film and ocular surface society (TFOS) Pain and Sensation Subcommittee Report, automating quantitative IVCM assessments would significantly improve research technique and interpretation of the results (5).\nAt the present, quantitative applications for evaluating corneal nerves range from fully manual (CCMetrics, University of Manchester, Manchester, UK) to semiautomated (NeuronJ, with ImageJ plugin, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MA, USA) to fully automated (ACCMetrics, University ofManchester, Manchester, UK), all of which generate varying degrees of quantitative nerve evaluation (11). Due to the laborious and time-consuming nature of applying fully automated CCMetrics software, the fully automated CCMetrics approach has been replaced with the semiautomated NeuronJ technique (12). The NeuronJ software traces the structure of the nerve semiautomatically with a smooth line, providing total length measurements. However, the operator\u2019s ability to discern the nerve\u2019s beginning and end impacts the accuracy of the measurements (13). ACCMetrics is a fully automated image analysis program that reduces the time required to evaluate an image to 15 s per image. ACCMetrics evaluates neural morphometric characteristics, such as corneal nerve fiber density (CNFD), CNFL, and corneal nerve branch density (CNBD), and nerve fiber total branch density, nerve fiber area, and nerve fiber width. As a result, it is particularly advantageous for major studies analyzing a massive amount of IVCM images (14).\nThe objective of this study is to evaluate the diagnostic performance of ACCMetrics, a fully automated software, with that of NeuronJ, a semiautomated program, in distinguishing patients with DED with ocular pain from healthy controls via IVCM morphometric analysis of the corneal SNP. The correlations between DED with ocular pain and several characteristics of the corneal SNP, such as the CNFD, CNBD, and CNFL, were also investigated to identify which was the more significant diagnostic parameter."

The study was authorized by the Ethics Committee of the Second Affiliated Hospital at Zhejiang University School of Medicine (2019-283). All participants freely signed an informed consent form. A total of 50 participants comprised DED patients (n = 25) and healthy controls (n= 25).\nAn OSDI score of \u226513 points, a Schirmer I test score of <10 mm/5min, and a tear film breakup time (TBUT) of <10 s, associated with Ocular Pain Assessment Survey (OPAS) scores of 10\u201327, were used as diagnostic criteria for DED with ocular pain.\nAn OSDI score of <7 points, a Schirmer I test score of \u226510 mm/5min, or a TBUT score of \u226510 s, associated with OPAS scores of 0\u20139, is considered healthy.\nIndividuals who met the following criteria were all excluded from the study: (1) inability or unwillingness to sign an informed consent form, (2) a history of eye surgery, (3) a history of wearing contact lenses during the previous 30 days, (4) a history of eye diseases other than DED, (5) a history of using any\nFrontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 2 February 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 831307\neye medication other than eye lubricant during the previous 3 months, and (6) severe systemic disease.\nIn vivo Confocal Microscopy In this study, all participants underwent an IVCM examination. The remote center of motion (RCM) module of the in vivo confocal microscope (HRT-3, Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Heidelberg, Germany) was used to observe the center of the corneal epithelium. The IVCM has a helium-neon diode laser with a wavelength of 670 nm, a \u00d760 objective lens (Olympus, Tokyo, Japan), a numerical aperture of 0.9, and a working distance of 0.0\u20133.0mm relative to the flat cap (Tomo-Cap, Heidelberg Engineering GmbH, Germany). The images were two-dimensional, with a field size of 400 \u00d7 400\u00b5m and a resolution of 384 \u00d7 384 pixels. An expert technician performed all operations. Before beginning the examination, the technician placed a drop of carbomer gel (Bausch & Lomb, Germany) on the microscope lens and then covered it with a disposable corneal contact cap. Next, a drop of topical anesthetic was applied to the eye (Proparacaine Hydrochloride Eye Drops, Alcon, United States), and the participant was instructed to place their chin and forehead in a bracket. Participants were instructed to look at a blip of light directly from the machine in front of them. The lens was zeroed out before being pushed toward the cornea of the participant\u2019s eye. The SNP of the cornea was then targeted at a depth of 50\u201380\u00b5m. The participants were then instructed to move their center of attention across their visual field to capture images of the corneal nerves from the central, upper, lower, nasal, and temporal orientations. A minimum of five clean, wrinkle-free, nonoverlapping, and representative photos were taken in each direction. The five most representative photos for each eye were selected and examined using NeuronJ and ACCMetrics. NeuronJ is a Java-based image analysis software package that includes a nerve-tracing plugin module. ACCMetrics is a software application for autonomous image analysis and processing developed by the University of Manchester in Manchester, United Kingdom. All images were manually assessed using NeuronJ by two experienced blind observers (YZ and WL). CNFD, CNBD, and CNFL were chosen as measurement indicators."

We used ACCMetrics, a fully automated measurement software, and NeuronJ, a semiautomated method, to identify SNP and detect ocular pain symptoms associated with DED with ocular pain.\nPrevious research studies have shown that patients with DED with ocular pain have fewer SNP than healthy controls and that ACCMetrics can partially replace the manual method. The semiautomated measurements were particularly well correlated with the measurements obtained via the manual methods for the same image (16). According to a study by Giannaccare et al., the ACCMetrics software can detect alternations in SNP and distinguish DED patients (6). In patients with DED with ocular pain, Kheirkhah et al. discovered a significantly low number and density of sub-basal nerves (17). However, research studies on the relationship between SNP and ocular pain symptoms in DED with ocular pain patients, and the corresponding measurement indicators, were hard to obtain. Simultaneously, it is necessary to demonstrate the specific efficacy of fully automated software over the traditional method.\nThe ACCMetrics software can partially replace semiautomated methods (18). The traditional semiautomated method has a high ICC and CoR between observers for the CNFD, CNBD, and CNFL (Table 1 and Figure 1). In Table 1, it can also be seen that the CNFL (ICC = 0.851, p < 0.001) has the highest ICC between ACCMetrics and Neuron J, whereas the CNBD (ICC = 0.608, p < 0.001) has a medium ICC. Between the two methods, the CNFL has the highest correlation (r = 0.864, p < 0.001), followed by the CNBD (r = 0.609, p < 0.001). The difference in the CNFL (4.7 \u00b1 2.4) is apparent on the Bland-Altman plot, and the majority of the scatter plots are distributed within the 95% CI. Based on the foregoing, we propose the CNFL as one of the measurement indicators to\nreplace semiautomated methods. Furthermore, when the ACCMetrics software is compared to the traditional method, there are negligible differences in the results. In Table 1, it can be seen that the ACCMetrics software recorded higher CNFD values, lower CNBD values, and lower CNFL values. Conversely, the CNFD has a weak correlation (ICC = 0.460, p < 0.001, r = 0.471, p < 0.001) between the two approaches. Figure 2 presents the reasons behind some\ndifferences, e.g., some nerve trunks were misidentified and a certain number of nerve bands and fibers were missed, as indicated by the arrows and circles in the images. Consequently, we must acknowledge that the two methods differ, and we do not recommend CNFD as the primary parameter to be measured.\nHowever, we recommend combining the CNFD, CNBD, and CNFL to support the diagnosis of DED with ocular pain, with the CNFL serving as the most critical parameter. Patients with ocular pain have fewer SNP, such as lower CNFD, CNBD, and CNFL values, regardless of whether the data are obtained via NeuronJ or ACCMetrics (17). From Table 4, it is apparent that when NeuronJ was used, CNFD was decreased by 11.32%, CNBD was decreased by 31.19%, and CNFL was decreased by 18.99%. Following the implementation of ACCMetrics, CNFD was decreased by 22.48%, CNBD was decreased by 22.39%, and CNFL was decreased by 18.28%. The ROC parameters (Figure 5) also demonstrate that the three indexes are all highly efficient diagnostic tools. In addition, we recommend the CNFL obtained via NeuronJ and ACCMetrics as the recommended parameter. DED patients with ocular pain exhibit distinctive pathological changes in the SNP, which can be detected using IVCM, and nerve quantification can be used to confirm the diagnosis.\nIt is widely accepted that manual and semiautomatedmethods have some advantages, such as the highest degree of consistency and efficacy. The observers can obtain additional pathological details on factors, such as inflammatory cells, nerve ganglion, neuroma, and nerve endpoint, which helps them make a more accurate diagnosis of the situation (19). However, these methods are not only time and energy consuming, but also challenging to apply in a medical environment, particularly, when analyzing large amounts of data (18).\nA fully automatedmethod is well suited to clinical applications because it is operated automatically, allowing clinicians to conserve time and energy. A significantly large number of clinical samples can be assessed and the values of parameters can be calculated, facilitating a deeply comprehensive understanding of the symptoms, and consequently, highly effective treatment for the patients (20). Nevertheless, there are some disadvantages, such as the extremely high image quality requirements, such as image representativeness, clarity, and contrast. As indicated in Figure 2, the ACCMetrics software recognizes fewer nerve fibers and is not very capable of distinguishing nerve branches, inflammatory cells, nerve ganglions, neuromas, nerve endpoints, and other such entities in the cornea (16).\nFrontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 8 February 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 831307\nFrontiers in Medicine | www.frontiersin.org 9 February 2022 | Volume 9 | Article 831307\nSimultaneously, our research does have some limitations. Standard IVCM generates narrow-field images of the cornea (400 \u00d7 400\u00b5m) that each display an extremely small area (<1%). According to the study of Winter et al., averaging parameters from multiple IVCM images may not result in very well accurate predictions for the whole image region (21). Additionally, it requires manual selection of non-overlapping IVCM images from a larger pool of images acquired during the image acquisition phase. Meanwhile, Allgeier et al. developed a novel automated approach that incorporates directed eye movements to rapidly expand the captured SNP region and axial focus plane oscillations to ensure complete imaging of the SNP (22). Moreover, we learned from their work on CNFL that expanding the mosaic image area stabilizes the CNFL values and decreases the movement variation (23). Currently, there have been a number of reports using wide-field imaging tools to study SNP-related diseases, such as the study of severe diabetic foot deformity by Herlyn et al. (24), Andreasson et al.\u2019s research on Parkinson\u2019s disease with restless legs syndrome (25), Sterenczak et al.\u2019s research on atypical cellular elements of unknown origin of a diabetic cornea (26), Koschmieder et al.\u2019s research on multiple myeloma (27), and so on. A significant advantage of the widefield technique is its capacity to offer imaging data with a wider field of view, possibly allowing the physician to analyze identical tissue sections repeatedly (22). Moreover, it prevents subjective field selection, resulting in an objective perspective of the whole SNP architecture, enabling accurate analysis of SNP patterns and precise quantification of SNP parameters (28). However, the wide-field technique for mosaic images is generally more time-consuming and difficult to implement in terms of software and hardware (e.g., three connected PCs) configuration. In our study, due to a lack of appropriate software and hardware, we relied on the widely used standard IVCM image extraction approach (29). Our study applied the well-accepted method of averaging the values of the five sites to represent the overall SNP of the eye (11). In the process of photographing and image selection, we tried to select images containing non-repeating SNP. The study of Ahmad Kheirkhah supported that there are no significant variations in the mean sub-basal nerve and dendritic cell densities between the average values of three representative standard IVCM images and wide-field mosaic composite images (29). However, given that the images we analyzed were of cases of decreased nerve density, the wide-field composite images may more accurately represent the entire cornea. We anticipate further studies on the application of wide-field techniques on DED with ocular pain. Our expectations and recommendations for the future of the ACCMetrics software are as follows: we anticipate that the structure will improve software detection while simultaneously increasing recognition in images with low contrast and poor clarity; improved detection of nerve bands, weak nerve fibers, inflammatory cells, nerve ganglions, neuromas, nerve endpoints, and other abnormalities in the nervous system, and detection of other irregularities in the corneal stroma. In summary, the fully automated software ACCMetrics can be used to partly replace semiautomated method NeuronJ. For instance, a relatively precise measurement of the CNFL can denote a significant degree of corneal nerve loss in patients, which can be used as a reference for the diagnosis of DED with ocular pain. Present status demonstrates the clinical importance in various fields of medicine and not only in DED with ocular pain. It may be turned out as an early biomarker for many neurodegenerative diseases, such as diabetic peripheral neuritis, Parkinson\u2019s disease, and so on. Nevertheless, current software often incorrectly recognizes and underestimates nerve fibers and is unable to identify biological details in images (e.g., inflammatory cells). Therefore, we anticipate that the ACCMetrics software will be upgraded and further developed to meet the demands of clinical practice."
