 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Examine how different network configurations (e.g. density, centrality, structural holes) interact with relational cohesion to impact knowledge acquisition. The paper focused on bridging ties, but looking at other structural factors could provide additional insights. 

2. Investigate the optimal balance between inter-network connections and intra-network cohesion for knowledge acquisition. Is there a point at which more bridging ties or greater cohesion starts to have diminishing returns?

3. Study how factors like firm size, industry, or technological uncertainty moderate the relationships between network configuration, cohesion, and learning outcomes. The effects may differ based on firm and industry characteristics.

4. Longitudinally track how firms adjust their network configurations over time as their knowledge needs and absorptive capacity evolves. Does the ideal configuration change as firms mature?

5. Compare the relative importance of different types of alliances (R&D, marketing, licensing, etc) for knowledge acquisition. Some alliance purposes may lend themselves more to bridging ties versus cohesion.
