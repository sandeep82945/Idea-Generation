The corncob was subjected to alkaline pretreatment, and was then hydrolysed by [Bmim][HSO4], which acted as both solvent and catalyst. The effects of process conditions, including mass percent of CC (1.0\u201310.0%),\nreaction temperature (46\u2013110 \u00b0C), and reaction time (1.2\u20132.8 h) on the size of cellulose nanocrystals (IL-\nCCCNC) were investigated by response surface methodology-central composite design. The obtained\nIL-CCCNC was characterized by Fourier transforms infrared spectroscopy, zeta sizer, scanning electron\nmicroscopy, transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, and thermogravimetry. The results\nshowed that the dimensions of the nanocellulose products were affected by the mass percent of CC\nand the reaction temperature, but were not significantly influenced by the reaction time under the\nstudied conditions. The optimal conditions, estimated by the developed model, were a mass percent of\n2.49%, reaction temperature of 100 \u00b0C, and reaction time of 1.5 h. The process successfully produced IL-\nCCCNC with a yield of 40.13%, average size of 166 nm, and crystallinity index (CrI) of 62.5%. The\nmorphology, chemical fingerprints, and thermal properties of the obtained IL-CCCNC were comparable\nto those extracted by alkaline and acid hydrolysis. After the reaction, [Bmim][HSO4] could be recovered with a yield of 88.32%, making it a viable green catalyst for the hydrolysis of CC cellulose.

In the next stage, the amorphous regions from pristine cellulose are eliminated to produce pure rod-like nanocellulose particles, commonly referred to as cellulose nanocrystals (CNCs), with crystallinity index as high as 54\u2013 88%, width of 4\u201370 nm, length of 100\u20136000 nm.1 Traditional processes mainly rely on alkali and bleaching pre-treatments of cellulose, followed by acid hydrolysis step. Even though these methods are inexpensive, they have negative impacts on CNC's properties and pose severe environmental issues.\nSustainable alternative methods for preparing CNCs, including chemical acid hydrolysis, mechanical and oxidation treatment, enzymatic hydrolysis, deep eutectic solvents, subcritical water hydrolysis, and combined processes have been attempted to reduce the use of toxic solvents.1 Nevertheless, the\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

ILs possess many unique characteristics, such as chemical and thermal stability, low melting point, non-volatility, non-ammability, negligible vapor pressure, and high solvency power.15 ILs are eco-friendly solvents since they can be recovered up to 99.5% aer evaporation of the anti-solvent. ILs can be recycled as many as ve times without losing their catalytic capabilities, and without creating hazardous wastes.16,17 When used as a solvent, IL can dissolve cellulose due to the interactions between its anions and the interand intramolecular hydroxyl groups of cellulose. Cellulosic biomasses such as wood, empty fruit bunch, rice husk, and cotton linter have been dissolved by ILs.14,18 As a catalyst, IL cleaves the glycosidic bonds between two anhydroglucose units of cellulose, yielding nanoscale cellulose products.19 The catalytic activity of ILs can be enhanced with the incorporation of an acidic functional group into their structures. These ILs are commonly referred to as Br\u00f8nsted acidic ILs. ILs have been used to isolate cellulose-rich fraction from oil palm empty fruit bunch,20 to produce regenerated cellulose bre from raw wood pulp,21 and to prepare CNC and cellulose nanoparticles from microcrystalline cellulose or cellulosic biomass.14,17,22\u201325However, few studies have applied IL as a catalyst to produce nanocellulose directly from agricultural biomass residues. It was established that as cellulose is subjected to IL hydrolysis, the process conditions such as type of biomass and ILs, reaction time, and temperature substantially affect the morphology, dimension, aspect ratio, density, mechanical properties, thermal stability, and crystallinity of the CNC or other cellulosic products.1,26 Different biomass residues require different treatment conditions due to their inherent structures and chemical compositions. In addition, the type of IL to be used is critical as its catalytic capability depends on its structure, viscosity, and acidity.15 Reaction temperature and time can inuence the crystallinity of CNCs produced.14 Elevated temperature may lead to biomass degradation, whereas low temperature would require extended treatment time. Therefore, optimizing IL hydrolysis conditions must be prioritized to produce CNC with desirable characteristics and functionality.\nIn this study, nanocellulose was directly prepared from alkaline-pretreated corncob (CC) by IL hydrolysis for the rst time. The effect of reaction conditions, including mass percent of CC loading, reaction temperature, and reaction time on the size of the nanocellulose was assessed and optimized by central composite design (CCD). The chemical structure, crystallinity index, thermal stability, and morphology of the obtained CNC were also characterized."

(2015) and Tan et al. (2015) with modications.14,27 Briey, dried corncob powder was soaked overnight in deionized water and then pre-treated with 2.0% KOH at 90 \u00b0C for 4 h to partially remove non-cellulosic components. The sample was nally washed with deionized water and ltered until neutrality. Preliminary analysis (Table 1) showed that the pre-treatment increased the cellulose content of CC from 35.2 to 77.4%. The hemicellulose and lignin content diminished from 46.9 to 17.5% and 16.7 to 4.8%, respectively, consistent with literature.28\u201330 It was evident that the pre-treatment effectively eliminated the recalcitrant components from the CC matrix, facilitating the hydrolysis of CC by IL in the subsequent steps.\nAer pre-treatment, CC powder was hydrolysed with ionic liquid [Bmim][HSO4]. The effects of three process parameters, including mass percent of CC loading (1.0\u201310.0%), reaction temperature (48\u2013110 \u00b0C), and time (1.2\u20132.8 h), were investigated, with all reaction conditions being given in Table S1.\u2020 For each treatment, a predetermined amount of CC and water was mixed with 5 g [Bmim][HSO4] to achieve the desired mass percent. Water was added to initiate acid-catalyzed hydrolysis.31 Before reaction, the suspension was homogenized by ultrasonics (UP200S, Hielscher, Germany) for 15 min to enhance the dispersion of CC in [Bmim][HSO4]. The hydrolysis process was carried out in a reux system, and the reaction was quenched by adding 60 ml of cold deionized water. The mixture was centrifuged at 10 000 rpm for 20 min to remove unhydrolyzed corncob particles. The supernatant was dialyzed against deionized water until the pH became stable.

The IL-CCCNC suspension had a narrow polydispersity index (PDI) of 0.51 and a high zeta potential value of \u221236.1 mV, indicating its uniform dispersion and stability in water. The effects of the mass percent of CC loading (X1), reaction temperature (X2), and time (X3) on the size of IL-CCCNC (Y) are illustrated in Fig. 2. The regression coefficients of the models based on coded (eqn (5)) as well as the actual values (eqn (6)) are given below:\nFig. 3 (A) Normalized FTIR spectrum of (i) CC, (ii) ACC, and (iii) ILCCCNC.

The results indicate that the size of IL-CCCNC correlates well with process variables and can be estimated from the reaction conditions. The model suggested the optimal conditions are at 2.49 mass percent of CC, 100 \u00b0C reaction temperature, and 1.5 h reaction time, producing ILCCCNC with an average size of 166 nm. The optimal point was validated by three independent experiments, yielding the average size of CC nanocellulose of 182 nm with a relative error of 9.63%. Eqn (6) demonstrates that the size of IL-CCCNC was signicantly affected by the mass percent of CC (X1) and reaction temperature (X2). The dimension of IL-CCCNC augmented with increase in X1 but was reduced when X2 increased. The reaction time (X3) did not have any visible impact on the size of IL-CCCNC.\nThe interactive effects between mass percent and reaction temperature are illustrated in Fig. 2A. During hydrolysis process, [Bmim][HSO4] diffused into the space between cellulose chains. [Bmim][HSO4] was dissociated into individual [Bmim]+ cation and [HSO4]\n\u2212 anion. Then, the electron donorelectron acceptor (EDA) complexes were formed between the charged species of [Bmim][HSO4] and hydrogen and oxygen atoms of the cellulose molecules (Fig. S1\u2020). The anion [HSO4] \u2212 was associated with the proton of hydroxyl bonds whereas the aromatic protons of the cation imidazolium attacked the oxygen atoms of hydroxyls. Consequently, cellulose chains were separated. Furthermore, within a cellulose chain, the carbon atoms of the b-1,4-glycosidic bonds were attacked by [HSO4]\n\u2212 and the oxygen atom of b-1,4-glycosidic bonds interacted with [Bmim]+ with its electron rich aromatic p system.14 The reaction resulted in the cleavage of b-1,4-glycosidic bonds within cellulose chains and reduction in the size of cellulose. In general, the size of ILCCCNC decreased with increasing reaction temperature, but the impact was more remarkable at lower mass percent than at higher one. It was possible that hydrolysis reaction at low temperature was mainly associated with the dissolution of the cellulose matrix, and the breakage of internal glycosidic bonds was quite limited. At a higher temperature range, the reaction becamemore drastic, leading to signicant reduction in the size of IL-CCCNC. Excessive thermal energy might lead to the remarkable disruption of intermolecular and intramolecular Hbonds as well as the glycosidic bonds of the lignocellulosic biomass, eventually releasing oligomers and other intermediate products with smaller sizes. However, elevated temperature would also break down cellulose molecules into low-molecular components like glucose, causing the loss of nanocellulose. Tan et al. (2015) noticed the decrease in the length and diameter of nanocellulose brils obtained from [Bmim][HSO4] hydrolysis when reaction temperature increased.14 It was hypothesized that the increasing temperature could have selectively removed\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Consequently, the breakage of glycosidic bonds produced small cellulose crystallite fragments. However, another IL, [Bmim][OAc], exhibited a different trend, as the crystallite size slightly increased with increasing temperature from 70\u2013110 \u00b0C.22\nMass percent of CC also had a profound inuence on the dimension of IL-CCCNC. When the mass loading was greater than 2%, an increase in the size of IL-CCCNC was noticed. Excessive loading of CC substrate could have impeded the access of hydronium ions into the reactive sites of rigid cellulose matrix. As a result, the hydrolysis was incomplete and largesized nanocellulose products were produced. The effect of different loading of cellulose substrate, from 5\u201325 wt%, on the IL hydrolysis of MCC was previously evaluated and reported by Low et al. (2020).17 MCC loading at 15 wt%was found to produce cellulose nanoparticles with the smallest crystallite size. At this substrate concentration, [HSO4]\n\u2212 was claimed to be optimal for the swelling and hydrolysis of cellulose to form nano-sized brils. High mass loading of substrate also increased viscosity of reaction mixture, which impaired the mobility of IL ions in cellulose bres. In our study, the optimal mass percent of CC was estimated to be 2.49%, signicantly lower than that of MCC. Understandably, CC still contained a certain amount of lignin (16.66 \u00b1 0.30%) and hemicellulose (46.90 \u00b1 1.17%), which dramatically increased the resistance of cellulose to IL hydrolysis.\nFrom the obtained results, it was noted that the impact of mass percent and temperature on the size of IL-CCCNC does not follow predictable trends. Xiang et al. (2003) showed that cellulose hydrolysis is a complex process due to the heterogeneous nature of the reaction.35 The reaction is even more complicated when the reaction kinetics is dependent on temperature for only a specic range. Moreover, the hydrolysis of cellulose is strongly affected by the crystallinity, the state of swelling, and the disintegration of the substrate. The reaction can involve several pathways that produce soluble and insoluble oligomers, disaccharides, anhydro sugars, glucose, glucosides, etc. Therefore, it can be inferred that IL-CCCNC is the net product of all these hydrolysis and degradation processes. So far, the mechanisms and the exact pathways associated with ILbased hydrolysis of cellulose have not been completely understood. It was only known that elevated temperature could destabilize the H-bonds of cellulose and accelerate the cleavage of glycosidic bonds, resulting in increased hydrolysis of the molecules. However, high temperature can also cause signicant loss of nanocellulose due to the conversion of cellulose into glucose and other by-products.\nIn Fig. 2B, the interactive effects of mass percent of CC and time tended to increase the dimension of IL-CCCNC. At 1.5 h, when the mass percent increased, the size of IL-CCCNC just varied from 350 to 410 nm. However, at a longer reaction time of 2.5 h, an increase in mass percent can result in nanocellulose product with signicantly larger size. As discussed previously, IL-CCCNC is the net product of complex series of simultaneous hydrolysis and degradation reactions. In this case, extended\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s). Published by the Royal Society of Chemistry\nreaction time and highmass percent could induce the release of large cellulose fragments or the formation of large oligomers, as reected in the size of the products.\nUnlike the other pairs of variables, the interactive effects of time and temperature (Fig. 2C) is more straightforward. At low temperature, increasing hydrolysis time decreased the size of IL-CCCNC. However, at 100 \u00b0C, as the reaction time increased from 1.5 to 2.5 h, the size of IL-CCCNC slightly increased from 230 nm to 330 nm. It was commonly known that the increasing temperature could disrupt the physical structure of cellulose,35 facilitating hydronium ion access into the cellulosic matrix, and consequently enhancing the hydrolysis process. However, as the reaction proceeds, some intermediate products form large hydrolysate complexes while others are degraded into smaller by-products. The nano-sized components obtained are net products of these processes. The underlying mechanisms of these reactions and their inuence on the dimensions of hydrolyzed cellulose require further investigations."

The results agree with those reported by Liu et al. (2016) and Tan et al.

However, it was observed that in ILCCCNC the peak at 3400 cm\u22121 was shied to a lower wavenumber as compared to CC and ACC. The trend is ascribed to the weakening of the intra-chain hydrogen bond of cellulose due to IL hydrolysis.17 Moreover, the notable band 1250 cm\u22121 attributed to C\u2013O stretching in the aryl-ether group of lignin and acetyl groups in hemicellulose diminished aer pretreatment and hydrolysis, indicating the capacity of the solvents to partially fractionate and remove non-cellulosic components of raw corncob.11 Furthermore, the peaks at 1732 cm\u22121, corresponding to C]O stretching of ester in hemicellulose groups, were no longer visible aer alkaline pretreatment and IL hydrolysis. The results coincide with chemical analysis, revealing signicant removal of hemicellulose aer pre-treatment and hydrolysis. The elimination of lignin and hemicellulose also facilitated the water absorption of cellulose, indicated by the peaks around 1650 cm\u22121 in ACC and ILCCCNC.\nFTIR spectroscopy also conrmed the successful recovery of [Bmim][HSO4] aer reaction.

The recovery of [Bmim][HSO4] with its conserved chemical structure aer the hydrolysis of CC enables its use as a green catalyst and solvent for nanocellulose production. The absence of these IL peaks in the spectra of ILCCCNC also conrms the complete removal of IL from the nanocellulose suspension during dialysis."

The results show that the pre-treatment and IL hydrolysis used in this work did not alter the integrity of cellulose I structure, consistent with the previous results obtained by FTIR. Similar ndings were reported by An et al. (2020), Harini & Chandra Mohan (2020), Liu et al. (2016), and Tan et al. (2015).14,33,36,37 It is worth noting that the diffraction peaks at 2q = 22\u00b0 in ACC and IL-CCCNC were slightly shied to higher Bragg angles, which could be attributed to the decrease in distance between cellulose stacked sheets. Moreover, sharper peaks positioned at the 2q value of 22\u00b0 of ACC and IL-CCCNC as compared to CC suggested increased crystallinity of the obtained product. The obtained crystallinity index values of the samples are 26.3%, 39.4%, and 62.5% for CC, ACC, and ILCCCNC, respectively, as presented in Table 2.

In addition, signicant reduction of lignin and hemicellulose attributable to pre-treatment, as revealed from chemical analysis (Table 1), could have improved the crystallinity of the obtained nanocellulose. Tan et al. (2015) ascribed the improvement of the crystallinity of nanocellulose aer [Bmim][HSO4] treatment to the rearrangement of more ordered and crystalline structures.14 An increase in the crystallinity of IL-CCCNC can improve its thermal stability, mechanical, and barrier properties, which are essential for cellulose applications."

All samples exhibited an initial weight loss at the temperature of about 100 \u00b0C, corresponding to water evaporation.14,33 Water is bound to cellulose due to the hydroxyl groups of anhydroglucose in the cellulose structure, which makes the material highly hydrophilic. The presence of water was conrmed by intermolecular hydrogen bonding at 1650 cm\u22121 in FTIR spectra. As the temperature increased, the decomposition range of CC, ACC, and IL-CCCNC were from 200\u2013375 \u00b0C (Tmax = 333 \u00b0C; % weight loss = 6.80), 250\u2013370 \u00b0C (Tmax = 347 \u00b0C; % weight loss = 4.48), and 210\u2013355 \u00b0C (Tmax = 334 \u00b0C; % weight loss = 4.93), respectively (Table 3). The pyrolysis of CC and ACC was characterized by two degradation peaks (Fig. 7B), at 289 \u00b0C and 333 \u00b0C for CC, and 304 \u00b0C and 347 \u00b0C for ACC, respectively. The patterns of thermograms are typical of cellulosic biomass residues.11 Normally, cellulosic residues are decomposed into two phases. The rst corresponds to the degradation of hemicellulose and possibly part of lignin. The Tmax of hemicellulose is about 280 \u00b0C, which is quite close to the Tmax of the rst phase. Lignin was degraded from 200\u2013600 \u00b0C and could be subjected to pyrolysis in this range of temperature.11,20 In the second phase, the decomposition of CC and ACC occurs at about 333 \u00b0C and 347 \u00b0C, close to the values reported by Arau\u0301jo et al. (2019).11 As the pre-treatment and hydrolysis removed a signicant amount of lignin and hemicellulose from CC, the degradation of ILCCCNC was predominantly associated with cellulose pyrolysis. Fig. 7B reveals two decomposition peaks of IL-CCCNC at 265 \u00b0C and 334 \u00b0C. Low et al.

IL-CCCNC exhibited only one broad endothermic peak at 335 \u00b0C, resulting from the depolymerization of cellulose.

The IL-CCCNC has physicochemical properties comparable to those prepared by traditional alkaline and acid hydrolysis. The effects of process conditions on the size of hydrolysed products were evaluated. The reaction temperature and mass percent of CC signicantly impacted the dimension of IL-CCCNC. Increasing temperature augmented the cleavage of hydrogen and glycosidic bonds of cellulose, yielding smaller nanocellulose particles. However, the biomass might be degraded into glucose and other by-products at high temperatures, resulting in the loss of cellulose. In this study, as the CC substrate still contained a certain amount of hemicellulose and lignin, an increase in mass percent remarkably inuenced the size of nanocellulose. It is possible that excessive mass percent would increase the viscosity of the solution and impair the hydrolysis process. Therefore, appropriate mass percent should be considered to produce nanocellulose in the desirable range of dimensions. At the optimal conditions (2.49% mass percent, 100 \u00b0C, and 1.5 h), about 40.13% (dry mass) of IL-CCCNC is obtained from CC, with dimension of 166 nm. The solvent and catalyst [Bmim][HSO4] can be facilely recovered and reused aer treatment.
