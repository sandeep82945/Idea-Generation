Exploring the Characteristics and Training of Health Care Providers in Shared Decision-Making: Given the identified gap regarding the specific characteristics, training, and attitudes of health care providers who engage in shared decision-making processes with Indigenous populations, future research could focus on identifying and promoting the competencies needed for effective and culturally sensitive shared decision-making. This could include studies on the training programs necessary for health care providers to effectively engage in shared decision-making with Indigenous patients, considering factors like cultural competence, communication skills, and understanding of Indigenous knowledge systems.

Development of Culturally Tailored Shared Decision-Making Tools: The paper suggests that shared decision-making interventions that are culturally tailored and developed in partnership with Indigenous communities are more effective. Future research could focus on the co-design of such tools across different Indigenous cultures, considering diverse health care settings and conditions. This could involve detailed ethnographic studies or participatory design processes to ensure the tools are deeply rooted in the cultural practices, languages, and values of the communities they serve.

Longitudinal Studies on the Impact of Shared Decision-Making on Health Outcomes: While the paper discusses the development and immediate effects of shared decision-making interventions, there is a need for longitudinal studies to assess the long-term impact of these interventions on health outcomes, health equity, and patient satisfaction among Indigenous populations. Such research could help in understanding how sustained engagement in shared decision-making affects chronic disease management, mental health, and overall wellbeing in Indigenous communities.

Investigating the Role of Community in Shared Decision-Making: The paper highlights the importance of community as a partner in shared decision-making. Future research could delve deeper into how community involvement can be structured and optimized within the shared decision-making process. This could include studying models of community governance that support health decision-making, methods for integrating community knowledge and priorities into health care practices, and the impact of community-led decision-making on health system trust and patient engagement.

Assessing the Impact of Shared Decision-Making on Systemic Racism and Health Disparities: Given the backdrop of systemic racism and health disparities faced by Indigenous populations, future research could explore how shared decision-making interventions might contribute to addressing these broader issues. This could involve studying the effects of shared decision-making on reducing health disparities, enhancing access to care, and improving the cultural safety of health care environments. Such research could provide insights into policy changes and health system reforms needed to support equitable health care for Indigenous Peoples.
