In this paper, we consider the inverse time-harmonic elastic scattering of multiple rigid particles in three dimensions. We measure the far field information and apply the time reversal method to recover the unknown elastic particles. Two regimes are considered depending on the size and distance among particles. First, an asymptotic analysis for the imaging of small and distant particles is given based on the scattering property of a single particle, which can be used for selective focusing. Second, when particles are not small but well-separated, a fast algorithm, based on the combination of multiple scattering theory and fast multipole method, is proposed to efficiently simulate the forward multiple scattering problem and applied in the inverse elastic scattering. Numerical experiments demonstrate the proposed method can determine the locations and shapes of multiple particles instantly.",

            "text": "The inverse scattering problem for elastic waves has attracted extensive attentions due to its applications in nondestructive testing, medical imaging and seismic exploration [2, 10, 11, 23]. This work is concerned with the time-harmonic inverse elastic scattering by multiple rigid particles embedded in a homogeneous and isotropic elastic medium in three dimensions. More specifically, given the elastic far field pattern from different incident directions, the goal is to recover the geometry information, including locations and shapes, of multiple unknown elastic scatterers.\nOver the years, many methods have been proposed to solve the inverse elastic obstacle problem, including both the iterative type and direct imaging methods. For instance, in [25, 27], domain derivatives for the elastic scattering were derived based on boundary integral equations and variational techniques, which can be used to design gradient descent methods for reconstructing unknown elastic obstacles. In [1], the linear sampling method based on the factorization of far field operator has been studied for the inverse elastic obstacle scattering. Related work on the sampling methods for elastic scattering can also be found in [4]. For the reconstruction of finitely many point-like and extended elastic obstacles, factorization methods have been extensively studied in [17,18].\nIn this paper, we develop the time reversal method (TRM) to reconstruct the multiple elastic particles in three dimensions. The basic idea of TRM is to emit an incident wave into the nondissipative elastic medium containing the unknown particles and then measure the corresponding far field. The measured field is then conjugated and re-emitted. From the far field data, it shows the unknown scatterers can be recovered by using the eigenvector of the far field operator as the kernel of a Herglotz incident wave. A special but important case is when particles are small and distant, the wave interaction among different particles can be ignored. Therefore, the far field is approximately given as a superposition of scattering from each individual particle, so the operator can be diagonalized by the eigenfunctions of each particle. Based on the asymptotic analysis, we give the approximate eigenfunctions corresponding to significant eigenvalues for each particle, which can be used to selectively focus a given particle. It is worth mentioning that the mathematical\n2020 Mathematics Subject Classification. 35B40, 35P25, 65R20, 78A46. Key words and phrases.

Our result can be taken as an extension from the acoustic and electromagnetic scattering to the elastic scattering.\nWhen the size of each particle is comparable to the wavelength of the incoming field and the distribution of particles is reasonably dense, the interaction of the particles involves non-negligible multiple scattering effects. To apply the time reversal method, a numerical algorithm for the forward problem is needed to obtain the scattered information from multiple particles. Practical algorithms often rely on the addition theorem [28] to transform the field from one particle to another. However, straightforward computation for the coefficients in the addition theorem is very expensive and suffers from numerical instability [32]. In this situation, the application of TRM becomes very challenging as it requires the far field data from all incident directions and measured in all directions as well. Since the forward problem has to be solved many times, it is prohibitively difficult when the number of particles is large, especially in three dimensions.\nOn the other hand, wave scattering from multiple particles is also referred as \u201cmultiple scattering\u201d in the literature, and has a very rich history in the acoustics and electromagnetics [28, 31]. The formulation of scattering from multiple particles goes back to Foldy\u2019s formulation for point scatterers in acoustic scattering [12]. Therefore, developing an efficient forward solver for the elastic scattering of multiple particles has its own value beyond the inverse scattering. In this work, we propose a fast and highly accurate numerical method for solving the elastic scattering problem from well-separated multiple particles. The method extends the classic multiple scattering theory for acoustic and electromagnetic waves to elastic waves. It can handle many particles that are arbitrarily shaped and randomly located in a homogeneous medium. The idea goes back to [13, 20\u201322] for the electromagnetic scattering of multiple particles. More specifically, for a given particle, we first construct a scattering matrix that maps the incoming wave to the outgoing wave. If all the particles are identical, up to a shift and rotation, the scattering matrix only has to be computed once. With this matrix precomputed, we then treat the outgoing scattering coefficients, instead of the discretization points on the boundary of particles, as the unknowns in our equation. For a given accuracy, the number of truncated terms in the outgoing scattering coefficients is much less than the number of boundary unknowns, especially for particles with complicated geometry. The resulted system is then solved by an iterative solver accelerated by the fast multipole method (FMM) [30]. Numerically we demonstrate that the algorithm is well suited for the forward simulation of elastic scattering from multiple particles.\nThe paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we formulate the scattering and inverse scattering problems of multiple elastic particles in three dimensions. Section 3 develops the time reversal method to solve the inverse multiple elastic obstacles problem. Section 4 gives the asymptotic analysis for the selective focusing of small and distant particles. Section 5 presents the multiple scattering theory for elastic particles and proposes the fast algorithm based on the scattering matrix and fast multipole method. Numerical experiments are presented in section 6 to show that the TRM can effectively solve the inverse scattering of multiple elastic particles with non-negligible interactions based on the fast solver. The paper is concluded in section 7."

The traction operator T\u03bd on \u0393 is defined by\nT\u03bd := 2\u00b5\u03bd \u00b7 \u2207+ \u03bb\u03bd\u2207 \u00b7+\u00b5\u03bd \u00d7 curl. (2.5)\nBased on the Betti\u2019s formula [1] and the boundary condition (2.2), we can represent the scattered field v through the single layer integral formulation,\nv(x) = \u2212 \u222b\n\u0393 \u03a6(x, y)T\u03bd(y)u(y)dsy, x \u2208 R3 \\D.

Based on the asymptotic behavior of the fundamental solution (2.4), it can be verified that\nvp,\u221e(x\u0302) = \u2212 \u03ba2p\n4\u03c0\u03c92 \u222b \u0393 x\u0302x\u0302>e\u2212i\u03bapx\u0302\u00b7yT\u03bd(y)u(y)dsy,\nvs,\u221e(x\u0302) = \u2212 \u03ba2s\n4\u03c0\u03c92 \u222b \u0393 [I \u2212 x\u0302x\u0302>]e\u2212i\u03basx\u0302\u00b7yT\u03bd(y)u(y)dsy.\n(2.8)\nThe forward problem for the elastic scattering of multiple particles is:\n\u2022 Given the incident wave ui and the geometry information of D1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , DM , find the far field pattern vp,\u221e(x\u0302) and vs,\u221e(x\u0302) of the scattered field v.\nThe inverse problem of elastic scattering of multiple particles is:\n\u2022 Based on the far field pattern vp,\u221e(x\u0302) and vs,\u221e(x\u0302) from different incident directions, recover the geometry information of D1, D2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , DM , including locations and shapes.\nIt is worth mentioning that the two problems are equally important. They are connecting to each other in the sense that solving the inverse problem often requires solving the forward problem many times, including both the direct and iterative type inversion methods. Many algorithms concerning the forward and inverse problems have been discussed in the literature [5, 6, 9, 24], and yet fast algorithms for the elastic scattering and inverse scattering from many particles in three dimensions are still very rare. In the following sections, we will first introduce the time reversal method (TRM) to the inverse elastic scattering problem and then discuss the fast algorithm for elastic scattering of multiple particles."

It is easy to see that the far field operator F is compact since the kernel is smooth. Using the reciprocity relation of elastic wave, one can show the following result [1].\nTheorem 3.1. The far field operator F : L2p(S2) \u00d7 L2s(S2) \u2192 L2p(S2) \u00d7 L2s(S2) is a compact and normal operator. Its adjoint operator F \u2217 : L2p(S2) \u00d7 L2s(S2) \u2192 L2p(S2) \u00d7 L2s(S2) with respect to the inner product (3.3) is given by\nF \u2217f = RFRf, \u2200f \u2208 L2p(S2)\u00d7 L2s(S2),\nwhere R is the symmetry operator defined by Rf(\u03b1) = f(\u2212\u03b1), \u03b1 \u2208 S2.\nIt is worth mentioning that similar result also holds for the acoustic and electromagnetic scattering [7]. We are now able to define the time reversal operator T . First let us measure the far field of the scattered field due to the Herglotz wave uif with f \u2208 L2p(S2)\u00d7 L2s(S2), and then use the conjugate of the far field as the kernel g of a new Herglotz wave. In other words,\ng = RFf.\nThe symmetry operator R is used here in order to reemit the wave from the opposite of the measured direction. The time reversal operator T is then obtained by iterating this cycle twice\nTf = RFg = RFRFf. (3.6)\nIt holds the following property for the time reversal operator T .\nTheorem 3.2. The time reversal operator T is compact, self-adjoint and positive. It is defined as an operator from L2p(S2)\u00d7 L2s(S2) to itself with\nTf = FF \u2217f = F \u2217Ff (3.7)\nThe nonzero eigenvalues of T are exactly positive numbers |\u03bb1|2 \u2265 |\u03bb2|2 \u2265 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 > 0 where the sequence (\u03bbj)j\u22651 denotes the nonzero complex eigenvalue of the far field operator F . The corresponding eigenfunctions (fj)j\u22651 of F are exactly the eigenfunctions of T . If non-trivial solutions to the Navier equation in D with homogeneous Dirichlet do not exist, then (fj)j\u22651 form a complete orthonormal system in L2p(S2)\u00d7 L2s(S2).\nThis is also shown in [1], which shows that all the eigenvalues of the far-field operator F lie on the circle with center at (0, \u03c0/\u03c9) on the positive imaginary axis and radius 2\u03c0/\u03c9. The time reversal method is to illuminate an obstacle with Herglotz waves with kernel f corresponding to an eigenvector of F (or T ) with non-zero eigenvalue. In particular, the Herglotz wave generated by f with \u03bb 6= 0 will automatically focus on the obstacles, as shown by the following theorem.\nTheorem 3.3. Let \u03bb 6= 0 be an eigenvalue of F and f \u2208 L2p(S2) \u00d7 L2s(S2) an eigenvector of F associated with \u03bb. Then, the Herglotz wave uif associated with f has the following form\nuif = \u2212 \u03ba2p \u03bb\u03c93 \u222b \u0393D x\u0302x\u0302>j0(\u03bap||x\u2212 y||)T\u03bd(y)ufdsy \u2212 \u03ba2s \u03bb\u03c93 \u222b \u0393D (I \u2212 x\u0302x\u0302>)j0(\u03bas||x\u2212 y||)T\u03bd(y)ufdsy\nProof. Since f = (fp, fs) \u2208 L2p(S2)\u00d7 L2s(S2) is an eigenvector of F with eigenvalue \u03bb 6= 0, it holds\nfp(x\u0302) = 1\n\u03bb\u03c9 \u222b S2 vp,\u221e(x\u0302, \u03b1, fp(\u03b1), fs(\u03b1))ds\u03b1\n= \u2212 \u03ba2p\n4\u03c0\u03bb\u03c93 \u222b S2 \u222b \u0393D x\u0302x\u0302>e\u2212i\u03bapx\u0302\u00b7yT\u03bd(y)u(y, \u03b1, fp(\u03b1), fs(\u03b1))dsyds\u03b1\n= \u2212 \u03ba2p\n4\u03c0\u03bb\u03c93 \u222b \u0393D x\u0302x\u0302>e\u2212i\u03bapx\u0302\u00b7y \u222b S2 T\u03bd(y)u(y, \u03b1, fp(\u03b1), fs(\u03b1))ds\u03b1dsy\n= \u2212 \u03ba2p\n4\u03c0\u03bb\u03c93 \u222b \u0393D x\u0302x\u0302>e\u2212i\u03bapx\u0302\u00b7yT\u03bd(y)ufdsy (3.8)\nwhere T\u03bd(y)uf = \u222b S2 T\u03bd(y)u(y, \u03b1, fp(\u03b1), fs(\u03b1))ds\u03b1 is the traction of the elastic field generated by the Herglotz wave uif .\nSimilarly, it holds\nfs(x\u0302) = \u2212 \u03ba2s\n4\u03c0\u03bb\u03c93 \u222b \u0393D [I \u2212 x\u0302x\u0302>]e\u2212i\u03basx\u0302\u00b7yT\u03bd(y)ufdsy.

Theorem 3.3 also shows one can use only one wave (either compressional or shear wave) to focus the obstacles. Meanwhile, since the time reversal operator T is self-adjoint, by min-max principle, it holds that\n|\u03bb1|2 = sup f\u2208L2p(S2)\u00d7L2s(S2),||f ||22=1 ||Ff ||22.\nTherefore, the eigenfunction of the largest eigenvalue will maximize the illumination of particles. In general, for particles with non-negligible interactions, it is difficult to obtain the explicit form of significant eigenvalues, as well as the eigenfunctions, for the far field operator F with respect to the locations of particles. Only global focusing can be achieved for the TRM applied to the inverse scattering of multiple particles that are reasonably dense. However, for small and distant particles, selective focusing [16] an individual particle can be realized when the interaction among particles becomes weak, as shown in the next section."

            "text": "In this section, we assume the particles are far from each other so that multiple scattering among different particles is negligible. In this case, the inverse scattering of multiple particles is essentially reduced to the reconstruction of a single particle, which is also called inverse \u201cindependent scattering\u201d in the literature [31]. Here we first investigate the property of far field operator of a small sphere and then discuss the selective focusing of general-shaped small elastic particles.\n4.1. Focusing of a small sphere. The elastic scattering of a sphere can be fully characterized by Mie theory [26]. Denote S0 the sphere centered at the origin with radius R. For a given point x = (x1, x2, x3), denote (r, \u03b8, \u03c6) the spherical coordinates of x. Let Y m n , m = \u2212n, . . . , n, n = 0, 1, . . . be the orthonormal spherical harmonics on the unit sphere S2, which are defined by\nY mn (\u03b8, \u03c6) = (\u22121)m \u221a 2n+ 1\n4\u03c0 (n\u2212 |m|)! (n+ |m|)! P |m|n (cos \u03b8)e im\u03c6,\nwhere P |m| n (t), t \u2208 [\u22121, 1], are the associated Legendre functions [7]. Denote GradY mn the surface gradient of Y mn on S2. Let jn(r) be the spherical Bessel function and h (1) n (r) be the first kind spherical Hankel function of order n. Define the scalar functions\nu\u03ban,m(x) = jn(\u03bar)Y m n (\u03b8, \u03c6), v \u03ba n,m(x) = h (1) n (\u03bar)Y m n (\u03b8, \u03c6), (4.1)\nwhich are spherical wave functions and satisfy the three dimensional Helmholtz equation with exceptional point at the origin for v\u03ban,m(x). Based on the property of spherical harmonics, the incoming elastic field for the sphere S0 can be expanded as [26]\nui(x) = \u221e\u2211 n=1 n\u2211 m=\u2212n ( an,m\u2207\u00d7\u2207\u00d7 (xu\u03basn,m)/(i\u03bas) + bn,m\u2207\u00d7 (xu\u03basn,m) ) + \u221e\u2211 n=0 n\u2211 m=\u2212n cn,m\u2207u \u03bap n,m, (4.2)\nwhere {an,m, bn,m, cn,m} are called the incoming expansion coefficients of ui on S0.

To eliminate the difference of starting indices between the expansions of the shear and compressional incident wave, we simply let an,m = bn,m = 0 for n = 0 and write all the expansion coefficients starting from n = 0 uniformly. This applies to all the related quantities based on the spherical harmonic expansion unless otherwise stated.\nFor the plane wave incidence, explicit expression for these coefficients can be obtained through the vector analogue of the Jacobi\u2013Anger expansion [7]. Detailed expression is given in the appendix A. The kernel f \u2208 L2p(S2)\u00d7 L2s(S2) of a Herglotz wave can be expanded by\nf = \u221e\u2211 n=0 n\u2211 m=\u2212n ( fan,mGradY m n (x\u0302) + f b n,mx\u0302\u00d7GradY mn (x\u0302) + f cn,mY mn (x\u0302)x\u0302 ) .\nBased on the plane wave expansion (A.1), the incoming expansion coefficients for a Herglotz wave uif are simply\nan,m = 4\u03c0i nfan,m, bn,m = 4\u03c0i nf bn,m, cn,m = \u22124\u03c0in+1f cn,m/\u03bap. (4.3)\nAfter the incidence of ui, the scattered field v in the exterior of S0 is given by\nv = \u221e\u2211 n=0 n\u2211 m=\u2212n ( \u03b1n,m\u2207\u00d7\u2207\u00d7 (xv\u03basn,m)/(i\u03bas) + \u03b2n,m\u2207\u00d7 (xv\u03basn,m) + \u03b3n,m\u2207v \u03bap n,m ) , (4.4)\nwhere {\u03b1n,m, \u03b2n,m, \u03b3n,m} are referred as the outgoing expansion coefficients. The linear relation from the incoming expansion coefficients {an,m, bn,m, cn,m} to the outgoing expansion coefficients {\u03b1n,m, \u03b2n,m, \u03b3n,m} is defined as the scattering matrix S. For the sphere S0, the scattering matrix S is block diagonal with diagonal block Sn,m, and the explicit expression is given in the appendix B.\nThe far field pattern for the scattered field v based on the outgoing expansion coefficients is given by\nvs,\u221e = \u221e\u2211 n=0 n\u2211 m=\u2212n (\u2212i)n+1 \u03bas (\u03b1n,mGradY m n (x\u0302) + \u03b2n,mx\u0302GradY m n (x\u0302)) ,\nvp,\u221e = \u221e\u2211 n=0 n\u2211 m=\u2212n (\u2212i)n\u03b3n,mY mn (x\u0302)x\u0302.

(4.6)\nHere Dincn,m and D scat n,m are 3\u00d73 diagonal matrices with the diagonal elements given by equations (4.3) and (4.5). If the radius R of the sphere S0 is sufficiently small, we are able to obtain the following result.\nTheorem 4.2.

When n = 0, the only eigenvalue is \u03bb0,0 = 4\u03c0ij\u20320(\u03bapR)\n\u03baph (1)\u2032 0 (\u03bapR)\n= \u22124\u03c03 \u03ba 2 pR 3 +O(R5) with eigenfunction Y 00 (x\u0302)x\u0302.\nProof is straightforward calculation based on the explicit form of Fn,m and the asymptotic expansions of Bessel functions [29] for z \u2192 0\njn(z) = \u221a \u03c0/(2n+1\u0393(n+ 3/2)) ( zn \u2212 zn+2/(6 + 4n) ) +O(zn+4),\nh(1)n (z) = \u2212i2n\u0393(n+ 1/2)/ \u221a \u03c0(z\u2212(n+1) + z\u2212(n\u22121)/(4n\u2212 2)) +O(z\u2212n+3).\n(4.8)\nFrom Theorem 4.2, one can see that the eigenvalues decrease as R2 as n increases, which is similar to the behavior of acoustic scattering [16]. In particular, for a small sphere, there are three significant eigenvalues (\u03bb11,m, m = \u22121, 0, 1), whose eigenfunctions will dominate the far field scattering. Such a conclusion can be extended to the general-shaped small particles and one can use it to achieve selective focusing.\n4.2. Selective focusing. Consider a family of particles {D\u03b5l , l = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,M}. Each D\u03b5l is obtained from a reference domain Dl by a dilation ratio \u03b5 and a translation\nD\u03b5l = {x = sl + \u03b5\u03be; \u03be \u2208 Dl} , (4.9)\nwhere sl is the center of D \u03b5 l . We choose sl differently so that all the obstacles are not intersecting with small \u03b5.\nLet \u0393\u03b5l denote the boundary of D \u03b5 l . In order to study the asymptotic behavior of the elastic scattering, we let \u03ba = max{\u03bap, \u03bas} and denote \u03a6\u03ba(x, y) the fundamental solution (2.4) that depends on \u03ba. Based on the integral representation (2.6), the scattered field can be represented by\nv(x) = M\u2211 j=1 \u222b \u0393\u03b5j \u03a6\u03ba(x, y)J j(y)dsy, x \u2208 \u2126 = R3\\ \u222aMj=1 D\u03b5j , (4.10)\nwhere J j is the unknown traction field on \u0393 \u03b5 j (up to a sign). Since all the obstacles are rigid, given the Herglotz incident wave uif , it holds\nv|\u0393\u03b5l = \u2212u i f |\u0393\u03b5l , l = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,M. (4.11)\nDenote the single layer boundary operator as S\u03ba,\u03b5l,j J j = \u222b\n\u0393\u03b5j\n\u03a6\u03ba(x, y)J j(y)dsy, x \u2208 \u0393\u03b5l .\nBased on the boundary condition (4.11), we obtain the boundary integral system\nM\u2211 j=1 S\u03ba,\u03b5l,j J j = \u2212u i f |\u0393\u03b5l , l = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,M. (4.12)\nIn order to analyze the solution of (4.12) when \u03b5\u2192 0, we make the change of variables\n\u03be = x\u2212 sl \u03b5 \u2208 Dl, \u03b7 = y \u2212 sj \u03b5 \u2208 Dj ,\nso the scaled vector fields and fundamental solution become\nJ\u03b5j(\u03b7) = J j(x),\n\u03a6\u03ba,\u03b5l,j (\u03be, \u03b7) = \u03a6\u03ba(x, y),\nfor x \u2208 Dl, y \u2208 Dj . Based on the rescaled variables, we have\nS\u03ba,\u03b5l,j J \u03b5 j = \u03b5 2 \u222b \u0393j \u03a6\u03ba,\u03b5l,j (\u03be, \u03b7)J \u03b5 j(\u03b7)ds\u03b7. (4.13)\nThe boundary integral system becomes\nM\u2211 j=1 S\u03ba,\u03b5l,j J \u03b5 j = \u2212u i,\u03b5 f |\u0393l , l = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,M, (4.14)\nwith ui,\u03b5f (\u03be) = u i f (x). Now consider the diagonal term in (4.14) and let \u03b5\u2192 0. Using the fact that\n\u03a6\u03ba,\u03b5l,l (\u03be, \u03b7) = 1\n\u03b5 \u03a6\u03ba\u03b5(\u03be, \u03b7), (4.15)\nwe obtain that the diagonal term is\nS\u03ba,\u03b5l,l J \u03b5 l = \u03b5 \u222b \u0393l \u03a6\u03ba\u03b5(\u03be, \u03b7)J \u03b5 l (\u03b7)ds\u03b7 = \u03b5S\u0303 \u03ba,\u03b5 l,l J \u03b5 l , l = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N. (4.16)\nWhen \u03ba\u03b5 \u2192 0, S\u0303\u03ba,\u03b5l,l converges to the single layer boundary integral operator of the zero frequency problem, namely, the Lame\u0301 system. In particular, let vi(\u03be), i = 1, 2, 3, satisfy the Lame\u0301 system \u00b5\u2206vi + (\u03bb+ \u00b5)\u2207\u2207 \u00b7 vi = 0 in R3 \\ Ol, vi = \u2212ei on \u0393l, vi(\u03be) = O ( 1 |\u03be| ) , \u2207vi(\u03be) = o ( 1 |\u03be| ) , as |\u03be| \u2192 +\u221e. (4.17) where {ei}3i=1 is the basis vector of R3. Then the boundary integral equation\u222b \u0393l \u03a60(\u03be, \u03b7)J 0 i (\u03b7)ds\u03b7 = \u2212ei, (4.18) admits a unique solution for i = 1, 2, 3 with J0i (\u03b7) = \u2212T\u03bdvi. Since \u03a6\u03ba\u03b5(\u03be, \u03b7) = \u03a60(\u03be, \u03b7) + O(\u03ba\u03b5) as \u03ba\u03b5 \u2192 0, the diagonal operator S\u03ba,\u03b5l,l is invertible when \u03ba\u03b5 is sufficiently small. In addition, the solution to the equation\nS\u03ba,\u03b5l,l J \u03b5 l = \u2212u i,\u03b5 f |\u0393l , l = 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,M, (4.19)\ncan be approximated by\n\u03b5J\u03b5l = \u2212 3\u2211 i=1 (ui,\u03b5f \u00b7 ei)T\u03bdvi|\u0393l +O(\u03ba\u03b5). (4.20)\nPlugging into (4.13) yields\nS\u03ba,\u03b5l,l J \u03b5 l = \u2212\u03b5 \u222b \u0393l \u03a6\u03ba,\u03b5l,l (\u03be, \u03b7) ( 3\u2211 i=1 (ui,\u03b5f \u00b7 ei)T\u03bdvi|\u0393l ) ds\u03b7 +O(\u03ba\u03b52). (4.21)\nFor the off diagonal terms S\u03ba,\u03b5l,j with l 6= j, let\nd = min 1\u2264l 6=j\u2264M\n|sl \u2212 sj |, (4.22)\nbe the minimal distance between the centers of particles. Using the relation\n|sl \u2212 sj + \u03b5(\u03be \u2212 \u03b7)| = |sl \u2212 sj | (1 +O(\u03b5/d)) , one can see that \u03a6\u03ba,\u03b5l,j = \u03a6\u03ba(sl, sj) [1 +O(\u03ba\u03b5)] , which implies\n||S\u03ba,\u03b5l,j J \u03b5 j ||\u221e = O(\u03b5/d) [1 +O(\u03ba\u03b5)] , for l 6= j, (4.23)\nwhere || \u00b7 ||\u221e is the maximum norm for continuous functions. It shows the multiple scattering effect can be neglected and the elastic field can be obtained by the superposition of low frequency scattering problem if the distance d is large enough. Based on the far field pattern of equation (4.21), we obtain the following theorem\nTheorem 4.3. Assume there are M elastic particles given by (4.9) with size \u03b5 sufficiently small and the distance d between any two particles sufficiently large. For all l = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,M and i = 1, 2, 3, let vi,l satisfy the Lame\u0301 system (4.17). Then the far field pattern v\u221e(x\u0302, \u03b1, fp(\u03b1), fs(\u03b1)) of the scattering problem (2.3) for the M particles is given by\n1 \u03b5 vp,\u221e(x\u0302, \u03b1, fp(\u03b1), fs(\u03b1)) = \u2212\u03ba2p 4\u03c0\u03c92 M\u2211 l=1 x\u0302x\u0302T e\u2212i\u03bapx\u0302\u00b7slvl\u221e(\u03b1, fp(\u03b1), fs(\u03b1)) +O(\u03ba\u03b5),\n1 \u03b5 vs,\u221e(x\u0302, \u03b1, fp(\u03b1), fs(\u03b1)) = \u2212\u03ba2s 4\u03c0\u03c92 M\u2211 l=1 (I \u2212 x\u0302x\u0302T )e\u2212i\u03basx\u0302\u00b7slvl\u221e(\u03b1, fp(\u03b1), fs(\u03b1)) +O(\u03ba\u03b5),\n(4.24)\nwith\nvl\u221e(\u03b1, fp(\u03b1), fs(\u03b1)) = 3\u2211 i=1 ( ei\u03bap\u03b1\u00b7slfp(\u03b1) + e i\u03bas\u03b1\u00b7slfs(\u03b1) ) \u00b7 ei \u222b \u0393l T\u03bdvi,ldsy.\nLet us define the limit far field operator F 0 for elastic scattering of small particles as\nF 0(f) = 1\n\u03c9 ( \u2212\u03ba2p 4\u03c0\u03c92 M\u2211 l=1 x\u0302x\u0302T e\u2212i\u03bapx\u0302\u00b7sl \u222b S2 vl\u221e(\u03b1, fp(\u03b1), fs(\u03b1))ds\u03b1,\n\u2212\u03ba2s 4\u03c0\u03c92 M\u2211 l=1 (I \u2212 x\u0302x\u0302T )e\u2212i\u03basx\u0302\u00b7sl \u222b S2 vl\u221e(\u03b1, fp(\u03b1), fs(\u03b1))ds\u03b1 ) (4.25) and the elastic polarizability tensor for Dl, 1 \u2264 l \u2264M , as\nPl = [\u222b \u0393l T\u03bdv1,ldsy, \u222b \u0393l T\u03bdv2,ldsy, \u222b \u0393l T\u03bdv3,ldsy ] .\nIn order to achieve selective focusing on particle Dl, we need to investigate the eigenfunciton of the limit far field operator F 0, which is stated by the following theorem.\nTheorem 4.4. For 1 \u2264 l \u2264M , assume Pl can be diagonalized by an orthonormal basis (e1,l, e2,l, e3,l) in R3 with diagonal elements given by \u03bbl,i,i = 1, 2, 3. Define the function fl,i = (fp,l,i, fs,l,i) \u2208 L2p(S2)\u00d7 L2s(S2) to be {\nfp,l,i(\u03b1) = \u03ba 2 p(ei,l \u00b7 \u03b1)\u03b1e\u2212i\u03bap\u03b1\u00b7sl , fs,l,i(\u03b1) = \u03ba 2 s(\u03b1\u00d7 (ei,l \u00d7 \u03b1))e\u2212i\u03bas\u03b1\u00b7sl .\n(4.26)\nThen the functions fl,i(\u03b1), 1 \u2264 l \u2264M, i = 1, 2, 3, are the approximate eigenfunctions of the limit far field operator F 0 and satisfy\nF 0(fl,i) = \u2212 \u03ba2p + 2\u03ba 2 s\n3\u03c93 \u03bbl,ifl,i +O((\u03bad)\u2212N ), for all N \u2208 N, (4.27)\nas d\u2192\u221e, where d is the distance defined in (4.22) and \u03ba = min{\u03bap, \u03bas}.\nProof. The linear independence of fl,i follows from the fact that fl,i is the far field pattern of elastic point source with polarization ei,l and the far field pattern is unique [7]. For a given fl,i, the Herglotz wave takes the form\nuifl,i(sj) = \u222b S2 \u03ba2p(ei,l \u00b7 \u03b1)\u03b1ei\u03bap\u03b1\u00b7(sj\u2212sl)ds\u03b1 + \u222b S2 \u03ba2s(\u03b1\u00d7 (ei,l \u00d7 \u03b1))ei\u03bas\u03b1\u00b7(sj\u2212sl)ds\u03b1\n=\n{ 4\u03c0(\u03ba2p+2\u03ba 2 s)\n3 ei,l, l = j,\nO((\u03bad)\u2212N ), l 6= j, (4.28)\nwhere the case for l = j follows from a direct computation and the case for l 6= j follows from the stationary phase theorem. Plugging the Herglotz wave (4.28) into the limit far field operator F 0 given by (4.25) yields the result (4.27).\nBy combining the results of Theorems 3.3 and 4.4, we see that if particles are small and distant, selective focusing on an individual particle can be achieved. We summarize the result in the following theorem.\nTheorem 4.5. For 1 \u2264 l \u2264 M , the approximate eigenfunctions fl,i(\u03b1), i = 1, 2, 3, given by (4.26) will selectively focus on the l-th particle.\nProof is again based on the stationary phase theorem and we simply omit."

            "text": "When particles are not small (compared to the wavelength) and the multiple scattering among particles is not negligible, the result above based on the asymptotic analysis for small particles is not applicable anymore. One must rely on the numerical algorithm to solve the inverse problem. However, since TRM needs the full aperture far field data from all incident directions on S2, it requires a large amount of forward simulations. A straightforward numerical method can be obtained through the discretization of a coupled boundary integral system resulted from (2.6). However, due to the existence of multiple scattering, the discretized linear system suffers from slow convergence when an iterative solver is used. Hence, numerical computation for multiple scattering is highly challenging, especially in three dimensions. To overcome this difficulty and accelerate the computation, we proceed by reviewing the multiple elastic scattering of spheres.\n5.1. Scattering from multiple spheres. We discuss the elastic scattering of multiple spherical particles under the assumption that all the spheres have the same radius and are non-intersecting with each other. Extension to spheres with different sizes is straightforward. Assume there are M spheres and denote Sl the l-th sphere. According to (4.2), the incoming field on the sphere Sl can be expressed as\nui(x) = \u221e\u2211 n=0 n\u2211 m=\u2212n ( aln,m\u2207\u00d7\u2207\u00d7 (xlu\u03basn,m(xl))/(i\u03bas) + bln,m\u2207\u00d7 (xlu\u03basn,m(xl)) + cln,m\u2207u \u03bap n,m(xl) ) ,\nwhere xl is the local coordinate of x with respect to the center of Sl and u \u03ba n,m(xl) = jn(\u03barl)Y m n (\u03b8l, \u03c6l) is computed in terms of the spherical coordinates (rl, \u03b8l, \u03c6l) of the point xl. The scattered field in the exterior of all the spheres can be represented by a sum of outgoing expansions, one centered at each sphere v(x) = M\u2211 l=1 \u221e\u2211 n=0 n\u2211 m=\u2212n ( \u03b1ln,m\u2207\u00d7\u2207\u00d7 (xlv\u03basn,m(xl))/(i\u03bas) + \u03b2ln,m\u2207\u00d7 (xlv\u03basn,m(xl)) + \u03b3ln,m\u2207v \u03bap n,m(xl) ) . Note that v\u03ban,m(xl) is also evaluated in terms of the spherical coordinate (rl, \u03b8l, \u03c6l) of the local coordinate xl. The coefficients (\u03b1 l n,m, \u03b2 l n,m, \u03b3 l n,m) are all unknowns and no longer trivial to find as compared to the single sphere case. They are determined by a linear system that imposes the rigid boundary condition (2.2) on each spherical boundary. In particular, the incoming field for each sphere has two components, one from the known external incident field ui, and the other from the field scattered from all the other spheres. This results in a dense linear system involving all of the unknowns. To construct such a linear system, we require the translation operator from the outgoing expansion centered at Sj to the incoming expansion centered at Sl [28]. More specifically, given the outgoing expansion coefficients {\u03b1jn,m, \u03b2jn,m, \u03b3jn,m} from the sphere Sj , the corresponding field induced on the sphere Sl can be expanded by the incoming coefficients {aljn,m, bljn,m, cljn,m} with aljn,m = \u2211\u221e n\u2032=0 \u2211n\u2032 m\u2032=\u2212n\u2032 { T a,\u03b1l,j (n,m, n \u2032,m\u2032)\u03b1jn\u2032,m\u2032 + T a,\u03b2 l,j (n,m, n \u2032,m\u2032)\u03b2jn\u2032,m\u2032 } , bljn,m = \u2211\u221e n\u2032=0 \u2211n\u2032 m\u2032=\u2212n\u2032 { T b,\u03b1l,j (n,m, n \u2032,m\u2032)\u03b1jn\u2032,m\u2032 + T b,\u03b2 l,j (n,m, n \u2032,m\u2032)\u03b2jn\u2032,m\u2032 } ,\ncljn,m = \u2211\u221e\nn\u2032=0 \u2211n\u2032 m\u2032=\u2212n\u2032 T c,\u03b3 l,j (n,m, n \u2032,m\u2032)\u03b3jn\u2032,m\u2032 ,\n(5.1)\nwhere T a,\u03b1l,j , T a,\u03b2 l,j , T b,\u03b1 l,j , T b,\u03b2 l,j and T c,\u03b3 l,j are translation operators. Their explicit expressions can be derived by addition theorem [28], and given in [32] based on the Gaunt coefficients. However, these expressions are highly involved and suffer from numerical instability.\nFor the ease of implementation and stability, here we make use of the projection formulas (see (5.2)-(5.4)) to obtain the incoming coefficients {aljn,m, bljn,m, cljn,m} by evaluating the incident field on the boundary of Sl induced by the outgoing expansion coefficients {\u03b1jn,m, \u03b2jn,m, \u03b3jn,m} from sphere Sj .\nThis is numerically much more stable and can be accelerated by the Fast Fourier Transform(FFT). More specifically, for a given incident wave ui = (uis,u i p) on a sphere S0, either from the external plane wave or the field induced from the scattered wave of other particles, one can derive the following result using the orthogonality of spherical harmonics,\nan,m = i\u03basR\nn(n+ 1)(jn(\u03basR) + \u03basRj\u2032n(\u03basR)) \u222b S0 uis \u00b7GradY \u2212mn (x\u0302)ds, (5.2)\nbn,m = \u22121\nn(n+ 1)jn(\u03basR) \u222b S0 uis \u00b7 x\u0302\u00d7GradY \u2212mn (x\u0302)ds, (5.3)\ncn,m = 1\n\u03bapj\u2032n(\u03bapR) \u222b S0 uip \u00b7 Y \u2212mn (x\u0302)x\u0302ds, (5.4)\nbased on the identities\n\u2207\u00d7\u2207\u00d7 (xu\u03basn,m) = \u2207(u\u03basn,m + x \u00b7 \u2207u\u03basn,m) + \u03ba2sxu\u03basn,m, \u2207\u00d7 (xu\u03basn,m) = \u2207u\u03basn,m \u00d7 x,\n\u2207u\u03bapn,m = \u03bapj\u2032n(\u03bapR)Y mn (x\u0302) + jn(\u03bapR)\nR GradY mn (x\u0302).\nRemark 5.1. The denominator in (5.2)-(5.4) might be zero for some resonance value of jn(r). However, the denominator in (5.2) and (5.3) can not be simultaneously zero, since all the zeros of jn(r) are simple [7]. Therefore, a remedy is to use\n\u2207\u00d7 uis/(i\u03bas) = \u221e\u2211 n=0 n\u2211 m=\u2212n ( bn,m\u2207\u00d7\u2207\u00d7 (xu\u03basn,m)/(i\u03bas)\u2212 an,m\u2207\u00d7 (xu\u03basn,m) ) on S0 to find an,m or bn,m when resonance happens. Similarly, one can use\ncn,m = R\nn(n+ 1)jn(\u03bapR) \u222b S0 uip \u00b7GradY \u2212mn (x\u0302)x\u0302ds.\nto find cn,m when j \u2032 n(\u03bapR) = 0. For numerical stability, the two ways can be combined together by least square. We skip the details by simply assuming that \u03bap and \u03bas are not the resonance frequencies in S0 for any n \u2265 0.\nTo sum up, the total elastic field on the sphere Sl is given by\nu = ui + \u2211 j 6=l \u221e\u2211 n=0 n\u2211 m=\u2212n ( aljn,m\u2207\u00d7\u2207\u00d7 (xlu\u03basn,m(xl))/(i\u03bas) + bljn,m\u2207\u00d7 (xlu\u03basn,m(xl)) + cljn,m\u2207u \u03bap n,m(xl) ) +\n\u221e\u2211 n=0 n\u2211 m=\u2212n ( \u03b1ln,m\u2207\u00d7\u2207\u00d7 (xlv\u03basn,m(xl))/(i\u03bas) + \u03b2ln,m\u2207\u00d7 (xlv\u03basn,m(xl)) + \u03b3ln,m\u2207v \u03bap n,m(xl) ) . (5.5)\nIt can been seen that the first term in the preceding expressions accounts for the external incoming field, while the next term accounts for the scattered field coming from all other spheres. The last term accounts for the fields being scattered by Sl itself. Based on the rigid boundary condition (2.2), it ends up to be a linear system\nS\u22121 \u03b1ln,m\u03b2ln,m \u03b3ln,m \u2212\u2211 j 6=l T a,\u03b1 l,j T a,\u03b2 l,j 0 T b,\u03b1l,j T b,\u03b2 l,j 0 0 0 T c,\u03b3l,j  \u03b1jn,m\u03b2jn,m \u03b3jn,m  = aln,mbln,m cln,m  , (5.6) with n = 0, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\u2212n \u2264 m \u2264 n, l = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,M. Equation (5.6) is the multiple scattering system for elastic spheres.\n5.2. Scattering of multiple general-shaped particles. We now extend the multiple scattering theory of spherical particles to the non-spherical case. For simplicity, we assume particles are well-separated in the sense that each particle is enclosed in a sphere and all the spheres are nonintersecting. In addition, assume all the particles are the same up to a rotation. In other words, every particle Dl is obtained by a translation and rotation from a reference particle D0 centered at the origin,\nDl = {x = sl +Qly; y \u2208 D0}, where sl \u2208 R3 and Ql is a 3\u00d7 3 rotation matrix. The main difference from the previous case to the current case is that we need a scattering matrix S for the non-spherical obstacle D0, which maps the incoming field to the scattered field of D0. This can not be obtained analytically but can be constructed numerically through the boundary integral equation. More specifically, denote \u03930 the boundary of D0. Given an incident wave u\ni, we can represent the scattered wave v by the single layer potential (2.6) (with \u0393 replaced by \u03930) and solve the boundary integral equation\u222b\n\u03930\n\u03a6(x, y)J(y)dsy = \u2212ui, x \u2208 \u03930. (5.7)\nNote that the boundary integral equation (5.7) is only uniquely solvable when \u03bas or \u03bap is not the interior Dirichlet eigenvalue of the elastic equation (2.1). We assume this is satisfied for D0 since the integral equation based on combined layer potential [26] can be used if it is not the case. Suppose now that we have the obstacle D0 enclosed by S0, where S0 is centered at the origin with radius R. To numerically construct the scattering matrix on S0, we sequentially choose\n\u2207\u00d7\u2207\u00d7 (xu\u03basn,m)/(i\u03bas), \u2207\u00d7 (xu\u03basn,m), \u2207u \u03bap n,m, m = \u2212n, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , n, n = 0, 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,\nas the incident wave ui for D0 and solve the boundary integral equation (5.7). Then evaluate the scattered wave v on S0 through (2.6) and convert it into outgoing expansion coefficients. The formula for converting the scattered wave v to the outgoing coefficients on S0 can also be obtained through projection\n\u03b1n,m = i\u03basR\nn(n+ 1)(h (1) n (\u03basR) + \u03basRh (1)\u2032 n (\u03basR)) \u222b S0 vs \u00b7GradY \u2212mn (x\u0302)ds, (5.8)\n\u03b2n,m = \u22121\nn(n+ 1)i\u03bash (1) n (\u03basR) \u222b S0 vs \u00b7 x\u0302\u00d7GradY \u2212mn (x\u0302)ds, (5.9)\n\u03b3n,m = 1\n\u03baph (1)\u2032 n (\u03bapR) \u222b S0 vp \u00b7 Y \u2212mn (x\u0302)x\u0302ds. (5.10)\nwhich is the same as (5.2)-(5.4) by simply replacing jn(r) by h (1) n (r). Once the scattering matrix S is known, the solution to the full elastic equation for M general-shaped particles can be turned into a multiple scattering problem of the enclosing spheres, which is exactly the same as equation (5.6).\n5.3. Fast algorithm for multiple particles scattering. Let us now assume all the incoming and outgoing expansion are truncated at n = N terms. When the number of particles M is large and all the particles have non-negligible interaction, direct solving (5.6) will be difficult since the system is large and dense. In addition, such a system is very ill-conditioned since the elements in the scattering matrix S is exponentially decreasing as n increases, as can be seen for the single sphere case. A better formulation is to multiply both sides by S, which yieldsI \u2212 S\u2211\nj 6=l\nT a,\u03b1 l,j T a,\u03b2 l,j 0\nT b,\u03b1l,j T b,\u03b2 l,j 0\n0 0 T c,\u03b3l,j   \u03b1jn,m\u03b2jn,m \u03b3jn,m  = S aln,mbln,m cln,m  , l = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,M, (5.11)\nwhere I is the identity matrix. This is equivalent to applying a block diagonal preconditioner to the system (5.6). Since the translation matrices Tl,j do not involve self interactions, the preconditioned system (5.11) is a discrete analogue of a second kind boundary integral equation, which is much better conditioned than the system (5.6) and converges rapidly when iterative solver like GMRES is used. Since the matrix is dense, straightforward implementation of the iterative solver suffers from expensive matrix\u2013vector multiply and requires O(M2N3) work in each iterative process. In order to accelerate the solution procedure, we apply the fast multipole method (FMM) to speed up the matrix\u2013vector product, which can easily reduce the cost to O(MN3) work per iteration. As the literature on FMMs is substantial, we omit the technical details and refer interested readers to [13,30] for detailed information.\nTo sum up, the multiple scattering method based on expansion coefficients not only reduces the number of degrees of freedom, but also pre-computes the solution for each particle in isolation, so that the linear system we solve by iteration on the multi-sphere system is much better conditioned and can be solved by the combination of GMRES and FMM with a cost proportional to M . Similar methods have been successfully applied to scattering of multiple particles in the acoustics [21] and electromagnetics [13].\nRemark 5.2. The error analysis of the proposed method is highly involved due to the multiple scattering. Numerically, spectral accuracy can be achieved when the truncation number N increases. However, the error not only depends on the truncation number, but also the wavenumber \u03bas and \u03bap, the closest distance of two particles, the accuracy for solving the boundary integral equation (5.7) and the FMM. Although there exist solvers for (5.7) with spectral accuracy [19, 26], and errors for the FMM has been analyzed in [8], detailed analysis for the error of multiple scattering is beyond the scope of this paper. In the case of a single sphere, since all the modes up to n = N is exact, the error is only due to the boundary values of the incident field for modes n > N . One can follow the calculation in [15] to show that the truncation error for plane wave incidence is\n|\u03b5N | \u2264 C e\u03baR/2\nN !\n( \u03baR\n2\n)N , with \u03ba = max{\u03bas, \u03bap}, (5.12)\nwith C independent of N and \u03baR, which is exponentially small for large N ."

            "text": "In this section, we test the algorithm in several examples. The general procedure is: first apply the fast multiple elastic scattering algorithm to obtain the far field data, and then use the time reversal method to recover the location and shape of particles. In the forward simulation, we apply GMRES to solve (5.11) with a residual accuracy 10\u22126 and modify the code of the fast multiple method provided in [13] to accelerate the matrix-vector product. For the inversion part, to avoid inverse crime and test the robustness of the algorithm, we add 5% Gaussian noise to the simulated far field data. Once the numerical far field operator F is found, the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are obtained through the \u2018eig \u2019 command in MATLAB, and the Herglotz wave uif is evaluated in a straightforward manner, although NUFFT [14] can be used to accelerate the evaluation if time becomes an issue. According to Theorem 3.3, both the compressional and shear incident wave can be used to focus the particles, but here we only use one component of the shear wave for simplicity.\nThroughout all the examples, the compressional and shear wavenumbers are chosen to be \u03bap = \u03c0 3 and \u03bas = 5\u03c0 8 , and the truncation number for each particle in the expansion (4.2) is N = 10. The far field is measured at 231 different directions in [0, \u03c0] \u00d7 [0, 2\u03c0], with 11 points in [0, \u03c0] chosen by Gauss-Legendre nodes and 21 equally spaced points in [0, 2\u03c0] .\n6.1. Example 1. In this example, we try to recover a single elastic sphere centered at (5, 0, 0) with radius 0.5. Results are shown in Figure 1, where 1(a) is the exact shape of the sphere. The\nreconstruction of the sphere is given in 1(b). The cross section in the z = 0 plane of the magnitude of Herglotz wave generated by the eigenfunction associated with the largest eigenvalue is shown in 1(c) and the full three dimensional plot is given in 1(d). Clearly, the Herglotz wave function achieves its maximum at the location of the sphere, which shows the time reversal method is very effective in reconstructing the location of a single sphere. To reconstruct the shape, we have to choose an appropriate cut-off value. Such a value is generally empirical, and here we choose the value to be 1 in order to obtain 1(b).\n6.2. Example 2. In this example, we test the reconstruction of a rotated starfish centered at (5, 0, 0), as shown in Figure 2(a). The shape is generated by rotating with respect to the z axis with a generating curve given by{\nr(t) = [2 + 0.5 cos(5\u03c0(t\u2212 1))] cos(\u03c0(t\u2212 0.5)), z(t) = [2 + 0.5 cos(5\u03c0(t\u2212 1))] sin(\u03c0(t\u2212 0.5)).\nThe reconstructed shape is show in 2(b), which is obtained by choosing a cut-off value to be 0.8 in the Hergoltz wave function. Again, the Hergoltz wave function is obtained by using the eigenfunction associated with the largest eigenvalue. Figure 2(c) shows that the location can be accurately reconstructed. In 2(d), we are trying to recover the shape of the unknown particle by using a different cut-off value 1.5. It shows the time reversal method can only vaguely reconstruct the shape of the obstacle. In order to accurately reconstruct the shape, an iterative type imaging method may be needed with the combination of the current result. Details will be explored in the future.\n6.3. Example 3. In this example, we are trying to recover the locations of three spheres simultaneously. The exact locations of the three spheres are shown in Figure 3(a). The recovered obstacles are given in (3)(b). In order to do the reconstruction, we use the Herglotz wave generated by the eigenfunction associated with the largest eigenvalue. Figure (3)(c) gives the magnitude of the Herglotz wave in the z = 0 plane and (3)(d) plots the Herglotz wave function in all the three planes. It clearly shows the location of the spheres can be globally illuminated by the Herglotz function.\n6.4. Example 4. In this example, we test the algorithm to recover multiple elastic particles. In particular, Figure (4)(a) gives the exact location of five spheres and (4)(b) shows the recovered obstacles based on TRM. Figure (4)(c) gives the exact location of 27 ellipsoids and (4)(d) shows the recovered obstacles based on TRM. In both cases, the locations of all the particles are accurately reconstructed. It is worth mentioning that our fast algorithm is able to complete the simulation in less than 1000 seconds. While most of the time is spent on the forward simulation, the time for the inversion part is negligible. This demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method."

We show that selective focusing can be achieved for small and distant particles. Detailed expression for the approximate eigenvectors is given based on the asymptotic analysis of independent elastic scattering.

The method greatly reduces the number of unknowns and vastly decrease the iteration number in GMRES based on the scattering matrix preconditioner. Numerical experiments show that the combination of TRM and the fast solver is very effective to simulate the inversion of multiple particles in the existence of non-negligible multiple scattering.
