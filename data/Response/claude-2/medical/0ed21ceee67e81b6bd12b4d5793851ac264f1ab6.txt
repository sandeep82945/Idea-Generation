 Here are 5 possible future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Conduct studies comparing the effectiveness of different pharmacological treatments (triptans, ergotamines, NSAIDs, opioids, etc.) for acute migraine relief. The paper found these were commonly used but did not compare their efficacy. 

2. Investigate the efficacy of non-pharmacological treatments like massage, acupuncture, yoga, relaxation techniques, etc. for acute migraine relief. The paper found limited evidence on these approaches.

3. Examine the safety and efficacy of self-initiated strategies like herbal supplements, vitamins, homeopathy, etc. for migraine. The paper found these are used despite limited evidence.

4. Study the impact of patient education and improved physician-patient collaboration on migraine outcomes. The paper highlighted the need for this based on diagnosis and treatment gaps.

5. Explore differences in migraine management between males and females. The paper discussed implications for women but did not compare management by gender.
