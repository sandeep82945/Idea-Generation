    "abstractText": "Anti-leishmanial drugs extracted from natural sources have not been sufficiently explored in the literature. Until now, leishmaniasis treatments have been limited to synthetic and expensive drugs. This study investigated, for the first time, the anti-leishmanial efficacy of essential oils (EOs) from the leaves of Citrus species (C. sinensis, C. limon, and C. clementina). Essential oils were extracted from three species by solvent free microwave extraction (SFME); in addition, lemon oil was also isolated by hydro-distillation (HD). These were investigated using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC\u2013MS) and evaluated against Leishmania species, namely Leishmania major and Leishmania infantum, using a mitochondrial tetrazolium test (MTT) assay. The chemical compositions of Citrus limon EOs obtained by HD and SFME showed some differences. The identified peaks of C. limon (SFME) represented 93.96%, where linalool was the major peak (44.21%), followed by sabinene (14.22%) and ocimene (6.09%). While the hydro-distilled oil of C. limon contained geranial (30.08%), limonene (27.09%), and neral (22.87%) in the identified peaks (96.67%). The identified components of C. clementina leaves oil (68.54%) showed twenty-six compounds, where the predominant compound was geranial (42.40%), followed by neral (26.79%) and limonene (14.48%). However, 89.82% C. sinensis oil was identified, where the major peaks were for neral (27.52%), linalool (25.83%), and geranial (23.44%). HD oil of lemon showed the highest activity against L. major, with moderate toxicity on murine macrophage (RAW 264.7) cells, and possessed the best selectivity index on both Leishmanial species (SI: 3.68; 6.38), followed by C. clementina oil and C. limon using SFME (0.9 \u00b1 0.29, 1.03 \u00b1 0.27, and 1.13 \u00b1 0.3), respectively. C. clementina oil induced the greatest activity on Leishmania infantum, followed by HD lemon and SFME lemon oils (0.32 \u00b1 0.18, 0.52 \u00b1 0.15, and 0.57 \u00b1 0.09, respectively) when compared to Amphotericin B (0.80 \u00b1 0.18 and 0.23 \u00b1 0.13) as a positive control, on both species, respectively. Our study suggests a potent anti-leishmanial activity of lemon oil (HD) on L. major, followed by C. clementina. With the same potency on L. infantum shown by C. clementina oil, followed by HD lemon oil. This effect could be attributed to the major compounds of limonene, citral, and neral, as well as the synergistic effect of other different compounds. These observations could be a starting point for the building of new anti-leishmanial drugs from natural origins, and which combine different EOs containing Citrus cultivars.",

            "text": "Leishmaniasis is a parasite and a vector-borne disease caused by the Leishmania genus. This protozoon is known to be a severe public health concern, resulting in high death rates and morbidity in various Mediterranean, Asian, African, and Latin American areas [1]. This disease affects more than 12 million people globally, in ninety eighty countries (tropical and subtropical) [1]. The disease\u2019s manifestation starts with cutaneous leishmaniasis, which is caused by L. major, and visceral leishmaniasis, which is caused by L. infantum. These parasites exhibit two well-defined forms. The first form is the flagellated extra-cellular promastigote, and the second is the non-motile intracellular amastigote [2]. In the absence of a candidate vaccine, antimony, which is composed of amphotericin B and miltefosine is the latest chemotherapy. Nonetheless, these chemical drugs have several limitations, including various side effects, toxicity, high cost, relapse, and low resistance [3,4]. Effective drug development becomes an essential requirement to avoid these concerns, particularly in the regions of endemic disease. The identification of bioactive natural compounds is an important research area for scientists to fight protozoal infections and their detrimental effects [5], as well as to discover new alternatives to ordinary chemical drugs [6,7]. Essential oils (EOs) exhibit many biological effects, such as larvicidal, insecticidal, anti-cancer, antiviral, antibiofilm, antibacterial, and antiparasitic effects [8]. Citrus plants are famous for their volatile oils. The potential of EOs Citrus and their compounds, such as limonene, linalool, and citral, has been reported against many organisms, such as Staphylococcus aureus, Listeria monocytenes, and Bacillus cereus [9,10]. Additionally, the leaf oils of Citrus have exhibited antimicrobial potential against many pathogens [11]. C. clementina EO, which is rich in monoterpenes, confers powerful anti-infectious properties against bacteria, viruses, and fungi, and also worms and parasites [12,13]. Citrus reticulata fruit peel showed a high anti-Leishmania amazonensis promastigote activity [14]. On the other hand, Citrus sinensis dried leaves and EO of Citrus limon also displayed antileishmanial activity. Various EO extraction methods have been developed since antiquity, starting with conventional technologies such as pressing, hydro distillation, steam distillation, and dry distillation [10,14]. The perfect extraction method should be non-destructive, must provide a high yield, and be time-efficient [15]. Natural product green extraction is considered a new concept to solve the challenges of the 21st century, to protect both the environment and consumers, and increase competition between industries for more economic, ecological, and innovative techniques [16]. Within the green extraction approach, the extract obtained should have the lowest possible impact on the environment (less energy and solvent consumption, etc.), and eventual recycling has to be planned for (co-products, biodegradability, etc.) [17]. Among these developed methods, microwave heating is a new technique being considered. It has been broadly applied in natural product extraction, especially in volatile extract papers [18,19]. According to rigorous research of the literature, there are not any data reported on the optimization of the application of microwaves for extraction of EOs from Citrus leaf species. In the present work, we chemically compared (GC-MS) the EO of C. sinensis, C. limon, and C. clementina using solvent-free microwave extraction (SFME), in addition to that of C. limon obtained by hydro-distillation (as an example for comparison between hydro distillation and microwave extraction), to evaluate the antiparasitic activity against Leishmania major and Leishmania infantum in vitro."

The leaves are alternate, with narrowly winged-petioles, the shape of blades ranges from elliptical, oblong to oval, bluntly toothed and they emit a strong characteristic Citrus odor, due to the presence of copious oil [21]. The size of lemon leaves is small to medium. The leaves are oblong, ovate, and taper to a point on the non-stem end. The green vibrant leaves have fine-toothed edges and grow alternately along the branches [22]. Clementine is one of the varieties of Citrus reticulate (Mandarin orange). It was named in 1902.

            "text": "In comparing our results with those previously reported, it was found that the composition of C. limon EOs in Spain, Portugal, Italy, France, Tunisia, and Morocco are characterized by high levels of limonene (56.99\u201371.87%), myrcene (0.9\u20131.47%), and geranial (0.1\u20135.43%), where our results indicated that linalool (44.21%) and geranial (30.08%) are the major compounds in lemon oil (SFME and HD, respectively). It was reported that the main EO compounds of C. clementina in Italy are limonene (95.46%), \u03b1-pinene (0.43%), and myrcene (1.82%) [24], whereas geranial (42.40%) was the major compound in our sample. The chemical composition of the EO of C. sinensis from Canada, Spain, France, Italy, Morocco, and Tunisia was characterized by a very high percentage of limonene exceeding 90%, with myrcene (0.05\u20133.77%) and linalool (0.04\u20139%), but in our sample, the major compounds were neral (27.52%) and linalool (25.83%). In agreement with our GC-MS analysis, Janoti et al. [25] noted that limonene (30.1\u201347.3%) was the main compound in the leaf oil of certain lemon species that were cultivated in India. Limonene, linalool, and terpineol (36.9%, 2.12%, and 4.19%) were found to a higher extent in Citrus limettioides compared to Citrus pseudo limon (10.6%, 1.7%, and 2.59%). Our results are also in agreement with those of Vekiari and Aydeoun [26,27], who showed that lemon leaf oil, of various origins, was characterized by high concentrations of limonene. However, our results did not conform to those mentioned by Owolabi [28], as the chemical profile of the oil of lemon leaf in the Owolabi study is poor in neral and geranial (4.5%, 4%). Both the yield and chemical composition of essential oils differ remarkably, depending on many factors. The qualitative and quantitative variations in the components of oils in this study and others can be attributed to geographic, genetic, and seasonal variations, as well as the organs of plants, ripening stage, cultivar, practices of culture, species, methods of extraction, climate, and environmental conditions [18,24,29]. Interestingly, the EOs from C. limon obtained by SFME and HD showed significant differences (Table 1). The former was dominated by linalool (44.21%) and sabinene (14.22%), whereas the latter was characterized by limonene (27.09%), neral (30.08%), and geranial (30.08%). HD extracts showed a higher percentage of monoterpenoids, including respective hydrocarbons and oxygenated (33.64%, 62.12%), than the SFME extracts (33.35%, 59.99%). This result could have been due to the more efficient heat flow induced by the microwaves, which produced a rapid heating step for the whole system; only 1 min during the SFME process but 30 min during the HD process. The whole sample was almost simultaneously heated, which could have resulted in the loss of the most volatile compounds, such as \u03b1-pinene, \u03b2-pinene, \u03b2-myrcene, \u03b4-3-carene, and p-cymene. The presence of these molecules in the HD extracts explains their characteristic and pleasant floral scent [18]. SFME extracts were characterized by large amounts of alcohols, such as linalool, \u03b1-terpineol, geraniol, ketones, and esters. Similarly, Nayak et al. [30] studied the extraction process of Citrus maxima (Burm.) using SFME and HD, and if we consider the content of the main compound, SFME was a more effective technique and produced the highest amount of heptenol, borneol, caryophyllene oxide, and trans-\u03b2-farnesene [30]. SFME produced EOs with higher quantities of valuable oxygenated compounds. This may be due to the re-\nPharmaceuticals 2022, 15, 1163 8 of 14\nduced heating time required, which partially prevents the decomposition of the oxygenated compounds [18,19,24]. EOs are a volatile and semi-volatile mixture of complex of lipophilic compounds, which can be obtained by various techniques, such as pressing, distillation, steam distillation, hydro-distillation, and solvent-free microwave extraction. However, numerous industrial operations have favored using microwaves (MW) for heating fresh materials, noting an exceptional capacity to penetrate at a deep level into materials, since this substantially reduces the processing time. On the other hand, MW heating, compared to the conventional heating process, seems to be a more economical and environmentally friendly technology. Industries that are involved in the extraction of natural products (cosmetics, perfume, food, pharmaceutical, and bio-fuel) have to combine process intensification with safer and cleaner extraction protocols. Process intensification covers all developments of new techniques, equipment, or procedures that bring significant progress in comparison with the current production methods [15,17]. The challenges in the industrial development of intensified processes are multiple: more compact production units and a reduced number of unit operations, raw material savings, energy process safety control, and reduction in waste and ecological footprint [17]. Some studies reported that SFME resulted in a larger yield than the conventional method HD for extracts such as guava (Psidium guajava) [31] and lavender (Lavandulax hybrida) essential oils [32]. However, other reported data did not show any differences between these methods. Yields of Ocimum basilicum, Rosmarinus officinalis, Thymus vulgaris, and Mentha crispa essential oils isolated through SFME and HD were similar quantitatively [31,32]. These results suggest that both SFME and HD can result in a higher yield of EOs, depending on the plant species. However, SFME is more effective than HD, concerning time and energy saving."

            "text": "Regarding our results for EOs isolated from the same lemon cultivar \u201cEureka\u201d, namely E1 and E4, we noticed that E1 was characterized by linalool: 44.21% and limonene: 4.34%, while E4 was characterized by linalool: 1.59% and limonene: 27.09%. In addition, E2 isolated from the cultivar \u201cCassar\u201d, containing linalool: 1.68% and limonene 14.48%, exhibited the highest activity on Lv50 (IC50 = 0.32 \u00b5g/mL). Thus, the biological effect of EOs is probably due to the combined effects of their main components and their minor constituents; the major contributors were linalool, limonene, neral, and geranial. Therefore, we can conclude that limonene, neral, and geranial-containing oils showed antileishmanial activity and that this was achieved in both lemon (HD) and clementine oils (SFME). Other Citrus plants with nearly the same components exerted an antileishmanial activity, as limonene 85.7% was the major compound of Citrus reticulata fruit peel [13], while lemon leaf oil contains neral and geranial as major compounds [33]. Limonene possesses low toxicity in humans and could be used as an enhancer for the percutaneous permeation of drugs. Limonene is a monoterpene that has antitumoral, antibiotic, and antiprotozoal activity. Limonene killed both Leishmania amazonensis promastigotes and amastigotes (IC50; 252.0 49.0 and 147.0 46.0 mM). It induces activity against Leishmania braziliensis, Leishmania major, and Leishmania chagasi promastigotes. A 300-mM limonene treatment of limonene to L. amazonensis-infected macrophages led to a reduction of 78% in infection rates. Topically or intrarectally treating mice with limonene that were infected by L. amazonensis resulted in a significant reduction in the sizes of lesions [34]. A linalool-rich essential oil from Croton cajucara induced potent antileishmanial activity with 50% lethal doses, 8.7 ng/mL for amastigotes and 8.3 ng/mL for promastigotes, that inhibited the L. amazonensis promastigotes growth at very low concentrations; MIC, 85.0 pg/mL [35]. Myrcia ovata, with geranial and neral as major constituents, was highly active, with IC50/96 h of 8.69 \u00b5g/mL, against promastigotes and caused ultrastructural alterations, including mitochondrial enlargement [36].\nPharmaceuticals 2022, 15, 1163 9 of 14\nThe mechanism of action of EOs is still unknown, because the specific cellular targets have not been identified yet. Nevertheless, it is generally related to cell membrane disruption, owing to their lipophilic properties, which ultimately lead to cell lysis [35]. Additionally, oils can interact with the membrane of mitochondria to produce free radicals that oxidize the macromolecules of the parasite, leading to their death (by apoptosis or necrosis) [35]. In order to understand the active compounds responsible for the anti-leishmanial effect, it is useful to compare the global effect of EOs with those of the isolated major compounds in their natural or synthetic state. Essid et al. [37] compared the anti-leishmanial effect of myrtle EOs and their reported standard compounds, such as \u03b1-pinene, caracole, \u03b2caryophyllene, citronellal, geraniol, camphor, and p-cymene, showing that the activity of the whole EOs exceeded that of the isolated marketed standards."

Cells and parasites were then incubated for 24 h in the presence of increasing concentrations of various extracts (ranging from 0.03 to 1 \u00b5g/mL). Negative controls correspond to cells or parasites cultured in the absence of plant oils."

The statistical significance of the differences between the treated and the control sample means was evaluated using Student\u2019s t-test and an ANOVA test, for pair-wise and multiple comparisons, respectively. A p-value < 0.05 was considered to imply significance. All computations were performed using Excel software (Microsoft Corporation, 2003, Albuquerque, NM, USA)."

            "text": "In this study, SFME was applied for the first time to isolate the volatile oils from Citrus species leaves (C. sinensis, C. lemon, and C. clementina). This highlighted the advantages of the SFME method to recover the most oxygenated compounds from the oil. A potent antileishmanial activity of lemon oil (HD) was produced on L. major, followed by C. clementina. The same effect was displayed on L. infantum by C. clementina oil, followed by HD lemon oil. This effect could be attributed to the major compounds, as well as the synergistic effect\nPharmaceuticals 2022, 15, 1163 12 of 14\nof different compounds. These findings could be a starting step for the building up of novel, less toxic, and more effective anti-leishmanial drugs, which could become available for low-income populations.\nAuthor Contributions: S.B. designed the paper, provided laboratory analysis, and wrote the paper.
