Development of Multi-Biomarker Detection Systems: Designing FET biosensors capable of simultaneously detecting multiple AD biomarkers, including Aβ, tau proteins, acetylcholine, and α-synuclein. This approach could improve diagnostic accuracy by providing a comprehensive biomarker profile for each patient, potentially allowing for earlier and more precise diagnosis of AD.

Integration of Machine Learning for Enhanced Sensitivity and Specificity: Applying machine learning algorithms to analyze the data collected from FET biosensors. This could involve training models to distinguish between the subtle differences in biomarker concentrations that signify early versus late stages of AD, or to differentiate AD from other neurodegenerative diseases based on biomarker profiles. This approach could significantly enhance the sensitivity and specificity of AD diagnosis.

Improvement of Biosensor Materials and Fabrication Techniques: Exploring the use of novel materials (e.g., 2D materials beyond graphene, such as transition metal dichalcogenides) and advanced fabrication techniques (e.g., precision nano-patterning) to develop FET biosensors with higher sensitivity, stability, and selectivity. This could also include investigating methods to reduce device-to-device variation and improve reproducibility.

Wearable or Implantable Biosensors for Continuous Monitoring: Developing wearable or implantable FET biosensor devices for continuous monitoring of AD biomarkers in bodily fluids such as sweat, saliva, or interstitial fluid. Such devices could provide real-time data on the progression of the disease or the effectiveness of treatments, offering a more dynamic approach to AD management.

Integration with Internet of Things (IoT) for Remote Health Monitoring: Creating an ecosystem where FET biosensors are integrated into IoT devices for remote health monitoring and management of AD. This would involve secure data transmission from biosensors to healthcare providers, enabling timely intervention based on changes in biomarker levels. This approach could also facilitate large-scale data collection for AD research, contributing to the development of new diagnostic markers and treatments.
