    "abstractText": "Controlling laser-induced periodic surface structures on semiconductor materials is of significant importance for micro/nanophotonics. We here demonstrate a new approach to form the unusual structures on 4H-SiC crystal surface under irradiation of three collinear temporally delayed femtosecond laser beams (800 nm wavelength, 50 fs duration, 1 kHz repetition), with orthogonal linear polarizations. Different types of surface structures, two-dimensional arrays of square islands (670 nm periodicity) and one-dimensional ripple structures (678 nm periodicity) are found to uniformly distribute over the laser-exposed areas, both of which are remarkably featured by the low spatial frequency. By altering the time delay among three laser beams, we can flexibly control the transition between the two surface structures. The experimental results are well explained by a physical model of the thermally correlated actions among three laser-material interaction processes. This investigation provides a simple, flexible, and controllable processing approach for the large-scale assembly of complex functional nanostructures on bulk semiconductor materials.",

            "text": "Femtosecond laser-induced periodic surface structures (fs-LIPSSs), as universal phenomena that occur on all types of materials including metals, semiconductors, and dielectrics [1\u20133], have been a topic of intensive study for decades. The fs-LIPSS technology, with a mask-free and single-step process, represents a superior micro- and nanoscale engineering technology for material surfaces over several top-down micro/nanofabrication techniques, including photon/electron-beam lithography [4,5], nanoimprinting [6], and laser direct writing [7], which often suffer from having high-cost, time-consuming, or chemical procedures [8]. The fs-LIPSS techniques with subwavelength or nanometer scales have the capability of manipulating the optical, mechanical, wetting, chemical, biological, and other properties of material surfaces, providing wide applications in many fields such as enhanced optical absorption [9], plasmonics [10], magnetic recording [11], sensing [12], and metal coloring [13]. Generally, the processing of LIPSSs is strongly dependent on laser conditions (wavelength, pulse energy, number of pulses, and the polarization state), material properties, and ambient environment [13\u201315]. One-dimensional (1D) LIPSSs, often termed ripples, formed under irradiation of a single femtosecond laser beam, have less degree of freedom for manipulating the optical, mechanical, wetting, chemical, biological and other properties, thus limiting the diversity of surface functionalizations. In general, 1D ripple structures often present two features: high\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 796. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano12050796 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 796 2 of 10\nspatial frequency (HSF) and low spatial frequency (LSF). Additionally, the switching from LSF to HSF cases can be tuned by a single laser pulse irradiation on semiconductors and dielectrics [16\u201318], but its controlling flexibility is very poor, which is mainly manifested as a self-organizing behavior. To expand the scope of surface functionalizations for multidisciplinary applications, some attempts have been made to fabricate two-dimensional (2D) LIPSSs, which mainly use either the double exposure with two laser beam interference or the single exposure with multi-beam interference [19,20]. Although these methods can produce large-area 2D LIPSSs, they are usually subjected to complexity for the design and adjustment of experimental optical paths. Recently, double femtosecond laser irradiations with certain temporal delays were proposed to flexibly control the morphology of LIPSSs via the transient surface properties of the optically excited materials. For example, through using double-fs-laser-beam irradiation, two kinds of 1D LIPSSs\u2014high-spatial-frequency (HSF) and low-spatial-frequency (LSF) ripple structures\u2014were demonstrated on silicon surfaces at different time delay regimes [21\u201324]. That is, the spatial periods of LIPSSs on silicon surfaces can be tuned via varying the time delay between double laser beams. The recent investigations of such a technique on different metal surfaces (tungsten, molybdenum, and nickel) and semiconductors (silicon carbide, diamond), or even transparent materials, demonstrated that several new types of 2D-LIPSSs, consisting of nanobump, triangular, and dot arrays, have been successfully created [25\u201328]. Furthermore, triangular 2D-LIPSSs, square 2DLIPSSs, and round structures created on the surface of stainless steel via double-pulse irradiation were previously reported [29]. In general, by altering the time delay between double-fs-laser beams, the surface morphology of 2D-LIPSSs, such as geometrical profiles, spatial periods, and structure feature sizes, can be flexibly tailored. In addition, concentric circular millimeter-scale macrostructures with a tail can be produced through femtosecond laser micro/nano dual-scale composite texture technology, as well as concentric circular structures with low/high/ultra-periodic nanostructures [30,31]. It should be pointed out that the formation of 2D-LIPSSs under irradiation of doublefs-laser-beam on semiconductor surfaces was rarely reported, and the morphology distribution of 1D ripple surface structures mostly presented low regularity. In our recent report of a three-fs-laser-beam irradiation experiment, the regularity of 1D ripple structures formed on a 4H-SiC surface was significantly improved, and the structure period was found to transfer from HSF to LSF regime [32], which performs more degrees of freedom and has superiority in controlling the LIPSS formation. In this paper, we investigate the control of 2D LIPSS formation on a 4H-SiC crystal surface by using the temporally delayed irradiation of triple femtosecond laser beams, associated with the orthogonal linear polarizations in successive sequences. When their mutual time delays are varied in a range of 0~60 ps, we can observe the formation of 1D ripple structures and 2D periodic arrays of square islands, both of which possess the evident LSF features and the uniform distribution, i.e., a larger spatial period similar to that occurring in a metal-like state. Subsequently, we provide discussion and analyses based on mutual correlations among three ultrafast surface dynamics, which gives new insights into the nonequilibrium change in the material during the laser-induced structures."

At first, each laser pulse out of the amplifier was divided into three subpulse beams (P1, P2, and P3) via two splitters (BS1 and BS2). During the optical paths of P2 and P3 beams, we employed two delay lines for producing the temporal delays among three subpulses. Moreover, two half-wave plates were also inserted into the optical paths of P1 and P3 beams to change their linear polarization from the horizontal to the vertical directions.

In startling contrast to the aforementioned 1D HSF ripple structures, such kind of structure formation undoubtedly implies physical correlations among dynamic processes of three laser-material interactions. The peculiarities of such surface structures can be described as follows: (1) the spatial alignments of the square islands seem to be periodic in two directions that are, respectively, parallel or perpendicular to the incident laser polarization; (2) the measured periods of the structures in two (both vertical and horizontal) directions are almost equal to \u039b = 670 nm, which belong to the typical LSF phenomenon; (3) the characteristic dimension of the structure cell is as small as about D = 486 nm.

Instead, the attained structure period close to the incident laser wavelength is more similar to the observations on the metal surfaces [36], even though the two materials have many physical properties. Subsequently, we investigated how the time delay of triple laser irradiations (0.07 J/cm2/pulse) affects the structure formation on 4H-SiC material. For example, when the first delay time increased up to \u2206t1 = 40 ps while keeping the second delay time at \u2206t2 = 30 ps, it is unexpectedly found that the formation of the surface structures turn to present 1D periodic grating profiles rather than 2D periodic arrays of square islands, as shown in Figure 4. In this case, the formation of 1D grating-like structures appears to be uniform, with the measured spatial period of about \u039b = 678 nm, still belonging to the LSF phenomenon. Remarkably, the spatial orientation of 1D ripple structures becomes perpendicular to the polarization direction of the third subpulse laser irradiation, P3. The measured duty ratio of the grating ridge to the structure period approximates\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 796 5 of 10\n\u03a5 = 0.71 (\u03a5 = D/\u039b, where D is the width of the grating ridge), which indicates the ablation groove width is about W = 203 nm, and the HSF ripple structures usually have the value of \u03a5 = 0.9. This result is much different from situations obtained upon laser irradiation of either the single beam or double beams. For the case of the double-fs-beam irradiation, 1D grating-like ripple structures with HSF features were induced on the 4H-SiC crystal surface by using only two time-delayed femtosecond laser pulses with different linear polarizations, and it has been observed that the available ripple orientation also tended to change with different time delays, but the ripple period almost stayed invariant of approximate \u039b = 150 nm [37].

SEM image of 1D LSF-type ripple structures on 4H-SiC crystal surface using three femtosecond laser irradiations with the time delay of \u0394t1 = 40 ps and \u0394t2 = 30 ps, where the energy fluence of each laser beam is F = 0.07 J/cm2, and the polarization directions of the three laser irradiations are mutually orthogonal.\nFigure 5 shows the evolution of surface morphology induced by triple laser (0.07 J/cm2/pulse) irradiations on the 4H-SiC surface with the second time delay variation within a range of \u0394t2 = 18~32 ps, when the first time delay was fixed at \u0394t1 = 20 ps and \u0394t1 = 40 ps, respectively. Clearly, in the case of \u0394t1 = 20 ps, LSF-typed 2D periodic arrays of the square structures are always generated with varying the second time delay \u0394t2; conversely, in the case of \u0394t1 = 40 ps, LSF-typed 1D periodic ripple structures can be produced regardless of changing the second time delay \u0394t2, with orientation perpendicular to the polarization direction of the third subpulse laser irradiation P3. These phenomena imply that the first time delay \u0394t1 should play a predominant role in controlling the structural morphology on 4H-SiC surfaces. Figure 6 displays the measured dependence of either the spatial period or the duty ratio of 1D LSF ripple structures on the second time delay \u0394t2 under the condition of \u0394t1 = 40 ps.

According to the previous studies [38,39], upon femtosecond laser irradiation, a thin layer of plasma is transiently produced on the semiconductor surface due to the laserexcited free electrons via multiphoton absorption, so that the dielectric permittivity of the\nmaterial is tuned by the formula of\n2\nm 2 21 p\u03c9\u03b5\n\u03c9 \u03b3 = \u2212\n+ , where \u03c9p is the electron density (Ne) dependent plasma frequency, \u03c9 for the incident laser frequency, and \u03b3 for the electron collision frequency. If the electron density is above the critical value of Neth (corresponding to 1m\u03b5 = \u2212 ), the laser-exposed material surface is switched into a plasmonically active condition, which allows a direct excitation of SPP similar to a metallic state. Under the irradiation of single-beam laser pulses, the formation of 1D HSF-typed ripple structures is physically originated from interference between the incident laser and its excited surface plasmon polaritons [37], which tends to modulate the continuous distribution of the Gaussian laser energy into the intensity fringes, resulting in the spatially periodic optical absorption and heating of the electrons. After electron\u2013phonon coupling and thermal relaxation within the time scale of tens of picosecond [40], a grating-like distribution of the material temperature is established, i.e., the so-called transient temperature grating, which finally evolves into the permanent periodic ablation patterns via selective material removal once it is above the damage threshold temperature of Tth. The resultant ripple period can be estimated by \u039b = \u03bb0|1/\u03b5d + 1/\u03b5m|1/2 [15], where \u03b5d is the permittivity of the ambient medium of the laser-excited sample surface. It is clear that the spatial period of 1D ripple structures formed on the 4H-SiC surface is dependent on the density of laserexcited free electrons. Normally, under the single-beam irradiation, the medium surrounding the material surface is air substance, i.e., \u03b5d = 1, and the value of (1/\u03b5d + 1/\u03b5m)1/2 is far less than 1, which consequently creates the HSF-typed periodic surface structure. Based on the above discussion, we now propose a physical scenario to explain the structure formation on the 4H-SiC surface when irradiated by three temporally delayed femtosecond lasers, as sketched in Figure 7, in which each curve indicates the temporal evolution of the temperature of the transient grating induced by the individual subpulse laser irradiation. Noticeably, the maximum temperature of the transient grating induced by each subpulse laser irradiation should be below the threshold value Tth, because of having sufficiently low energy fluence. For the shorter time delay of \u0394t1 = 20 ps, because the surface temperature heated by the first laser irradiation slightly decays from the peak into a certain level, it is possible for the second laser irradiation to promote the transient grating temperature larger than the threshold value of Tth, which eventually makes the periodic ripple structures permanently imprint on the material surface, whose orientation is perpendicular to the polarization direction of the second laser irradiation.
