    "abstractText": "A microgravity environment in space, the elasticity of the tether, and complex flexible appendages make the tethered-towing system a nonlinear and underactuated system, which is sensitive and difficult to stabilize. This letter develops a controller based on wave propagation for tethered towing of defunct satellites, and carries out a robustness analysis of the controller via numerical simulation. Due to frequent space launch activities, a large amount of space debris (rocket upper stage, defunct satellite, etc.) has accumulated in orbit, posing an urgent threat to satellites currently working in orbit. Active removal of defunct satellites using elastic tether has many advantages, like long capture distance, lightweight and low cost. But, libration of the combination, tumbling of the defunct satellite, and oscillation of the tether are mutually influenced, making the system very difficult to control. The situation is even worse, when the vibration of solar panels is included. The difficulties and challenges in designing a controller for such a complex system are: 1) how to control the target when it is located far away and connected with an elastic tether; 2) how to reconcile multiple goals of suppressing libration, tumbling, oscillation and vibration in one controller; 3) how to make the controller robust in the presence of various types of uncertainties [1]. This letter designs a novel controller by analyzing the wave propagation in the tethered-towing system, in which flexible solar panels are considered. Numerical simulation results show that the attitude of defunct satellite can be stabilized and the vibration of solar panels can be suppressed, even in the presence of uncertainties. Related work: Significant efforts have been made to study the dynamics and control of tethered-towing system. Aslanov and Yudintsev [2] study the attitude behavior of a tethered debris with different initial conditions and system parameters. Zhong and Zhu [3] propose a method to stabilize simultaneously the attitude motion of a tethered target and the longitudinal oscillation of the tether by regulating the tug\u2019s thrust. Wen et al. [4] present a tension control law with only the tether length feedback to stabilize the relative motion. Pang et al. [5] study the in-plane chaotic behaviors of the tetheredtowing system, and find threshold borders of the chaos by using the Melnikov method. Yu et al. [6] study the rigid-flexible coupling dynamics of a tethered system, in which the son satellite is towed by a bare tape-shaped tether. All these studies adopt relatively simple models, in which the tug and debris spacecraft are assumed to be rigid bodies, or even point masses. Aslanov and Yudintsev [7], and Qi et al. [8] consider solar panels in their studies, but both of the studies are limited to dynamics and do not involve any control. Although control of tethered-towing system is a challenging problem, control methods developed for crane system may come in handy [9], [10], due to the similarity of the two systems. The \u201cwave-based control\u201d method proposed by O\u2019Connor can indirectly change the motion of a system through the direct control of mechanical waves, which has already achieved great success in detumbling the debris body [11] and suppressing the sloshing of residual liquid fuel [12], in a tethered-towing system. However, when flexible solar panels and uncertainties are present, the performance of the control is still unknown. System description: The tethered-towing system is shown in Fig. 1. The tug spacecraft is equipped with thrusters. The target is a defunct satellite which has a central rigid body and two flexible solar panels. The tether is massless but elastic. The coordinate frame is centered at the centroid of the tug. The z axis points away from the Earth\u2019s center. The x axis in the orbital plane is perpendicular to the z axis and points towards the target. The y axis completes the righthanded triad.",

The \u201cwave-based control\u201d method proposed by O\u2019Connor can indirectly change the motion of a system through the direct control of mechanical waves,\nwhich has already achieved great success in detumbling the debris body [11] and suppressing the sloshing of residual liquid fuel [12], in a tethered-towing system. However, when flexible solar panels and uncertainties are present, the performance of the control is still unknown.\nSystem description: The tethered-towing system is shown in Fig. 1. The tug spacecraft is equipped with thrusters. The target is a defunct satellite which has a central rigid body and two flexible solar panels. The tether is massless but elastic. The coordinate frame is centered at the centroid of the tug. The z axis points away from the Earth\u2019s center. The x axis in the orbital plane is perpendicular to the z axis and points towards the target. The y axis completes the righthanded triad.\n,The dynamics equations can be derived by Kane\u2019s method and can be expressed as F\u2217 +Fa = 0 (1) where F* is the generalized inertia force, and Fa is the generalized active force. The focus of this letter is not on dynamics, please refer to [8] for the detailed information of dynamics.\nActually, the authors have already developed a wave-based controller for a similar tethered-towing system, in which a chief tether attached to the tug branches into four sub-tethers that are attached to the corner points of the solar panels. However, since that hierarchical tether architecture brings passive rotation damping ability to the towing system, we are not sure which contributes more to the final stabilization of the system, the controller or the tether architecture? Therefore, research in the current letter has two main characteristics: 1) The towing system possess a single tether only so that the passive rotation damping ability is removed. Then, it is able to determine the contribution of the controller only. 2) Various types of uncertainties are incorporated in numerical simulations, so that the robustness of the controller can be analyzed.\nPrinciple of controller: The attention is not paid to the vibrations themselves, but to the waves propagating along the tether caused by them. As long as all the waves are absorbed by controlling the tug, all forms of vibration existed in the system can be suppressed.\nThe longitudinal vibration of the tether is produced by the towing of the tug. A series of waves are generated at the tether attachment point on the tug and propagated towards the central rigid body along the tether. When the wave arrives at the satellite body, the propagation medium changes, one part of the wave is reflected, and the other part is transmitted to the solar panels. Then, at the ends of the solar panels or the tether attachment point on the tug, the induced wave is completely reflected back and propagated continuously in the system, following the same rules (see Fig. 2). The transverse vibration of the tether is produced by the relative motion of the target, and the induced wave behaves very similarly (see Fig. 3 ). Obviously, any vibration in the system will finally propagate back, in the form of wave, to the tether attachment point on the tug. Therefore, if the tug is properly controlled to absorb all the induced waves, any vibration can be suppressed.\nPropagation of wave: Analysis of wave propagation is as follows. Longitudinal direction: The displacement of the cross section at\nposition x on the tether at time t is ux(x, t), which satisfies the longitudinal wave equation\n\u22022ux/\u2202t2 \u2212a2x(\u22022ux/\u2202x2) = 0 (2) where ax2 = E/\u03c1 is the propagation speed of longitudinal vibration, E is Young\u2019s modulus and \u03c1 is the linear density of the tether.

According to (2)\u2013(4), the expression of the forward propagating force wave at the tether attachment point on the tug is\nfx(t) = (Tx \u2212Zxvx)/2 (5) where Zx = \u03c1Sbx, and vx is the speed of the tether attachment point in the x direction.\nTransverse direction: The transverse displacement of the mass point at position x on the tether at time t is un (x, t), which satisfies \u22022un/\u2202t2 \u2212a2n(\u22022un/\u2202x2) = 0 (6) where an2 = T/\u03c1 represents the propagation speed of transverse vibration. Similarly, Tn can be expressed as Tn = T\u2202un/\u2202x = fn(x\u2212bnt, t)+gn(x+bnt, t) (7) where Tn, fn, gn and bn are tension component, forward force wave, backward force wave and propagation speed of force wave along transverse direction, respectively. Thus, the backward force wave at the tether attachment point on the tug is solved as\ngn(t) = (Tn +Znvn)/2 (8) where Zn = \u03c1bn , and vn represents the speed of the tether attachment point along transverse direction.\nThen, proportional control is used directly\nFx(t) = kx(T \u2217x/Zx \u2212 v\u2217x \u2212Tx/Zx + vx) Fy(t) = kn(T \u2217y /Zn + v \u2217 y \u2212Ty/Zn \u2212 vy) Fz(t) = kn(T \u2217z /Zn + v \u2217 z \u2212Tz/Zn \u2212 vz) (9)\nwhere kx and kn are control gains, T* and v* represent the desired tension and velocity, respectively. T* can be easily calculated by using Newton\u2019s second law and by assuming that the system finally converges to a steady state. v* is actually the orbital speed of the whole system, and can be settled in advance or in real-time.\nController performance: The initial orbital elements of the tug\nare (42 164 km, 0.008, 7\u00b0, 50\u00b0, 230\u00b0, 170\u00b0). The mass of the tug is 2500 kg and that of the target is 1800 kg. The lengths of their rigid bodies are 2 m. Their inertia matrices are diag(500, 500, 500) kg\u00b7m2 and diag(3920, 1720, 3330) kg\u00b7m2. The length and width of solar panel are 6.7 m and 1.2 m, respectively, and the natural frequencies of panels are 0.1778, 0.9172, 0.9845 Hz. The length, Young\u2019s modulus, linear density, and cross-sectional area of the tether are 78 m, 1.2\u00d7109 Pa, 7\u00d710\u22124 kg/m, and 7.75\u00d710\u22127 m2, respectively. The longitudinal and transverse wave impedances are 2. The longitudinal and transverse control gains are 300 and 200, respectively. The magnitude of the thrusting force is limited to 50 N. Initially, the target is spinning along the positive direction of z-axis, and the angular speed is 5\u00b0/s. The rotation of the target about the x axis is ignored. Some of the parameters are used in the dynamics, and the detailed information of them is given in the reference [8].\nTime history data of angular velocity of the target and vibration amplitude of the solar panels with and without control are presented in Fig. 4. The effectiveness of the designed controller is very evident. Obviously, the wave-based control can simultaneously stabilize the rotation of the target and suppresses the vibration of the solar panels, although the tug is located far away from the target and the panels it is attempting to control with an elastic tether between them.\npanels with and without control.\nRobustness analysis: Two types of uncertainties are incorporated to study the robustness of the controller. Fig. 5 shows the performance of the controller when the location of tether attachment point on the target varies. As you can see, when the tether is attached to the central rigid body, the performance of the controller is better. In contrast, when the tether is attached to the solar panel, the flexibility of the panel will make the whole system rather unstable, such that the rotation of the target and the vibration of the solar panel change dra-\nmatically during the first 300 s. This may cause structural failure, and eventually lead to an increase of smaller debris. However, even in such situations, the designed controller still works very well, and can stabilize the system after 300 s. Therefore, the controller has strong robustness to the location of tether attachment point.\nThen, the influence of input/output errors of the controller on the control performance is investigated. For the ideal signals of tether tension T, tug velocity v and control force F, we add normal random noises to them respectively, and therefore get the practical signal which is expressed by error rate \u03b5 as\nTe = T +N(0, \u03b5T ) ve = v+N(0,0.01\u03b5v) Fe = F +N(0, \u03b5F). (10)\nNote that a coefficient of 0.01 is included in the formula for the tug\u2019s velocity, that is because only in this way can the velocity error be consistent with the actual situation. Fig. 6 shows the vibration amplitude as a function of the error rate. Obviously, the error in tether tension and control force has little influence on control performance, but the error in the tug\u2019s velocity has a greater influence. This is because that the control force obtained from (9) is similar to a speed damping force [12], and it depends on the difference between the tug\u2019s velocity and the desired velocity, so an imprecise velocity is more likely to produce a worse control force that makes the system more unstable.\nConclusions: This letter designs a novel controller based on the information of waves propagated in the system, to stabilize the tethered tug-debris system, in which the debris is a defunct satellite equipped with flexible solar panels. Numerical simulations show that\nthe controller can effectively suppress the tumbling of the defunct satellite and the vibration of its solar panels simultaneously. Particularly, a robustness analysis indicates that the controller has strong robustness to the location of the tether attachment point, the input tether tension, and the output control force, but is sensitive, to some extent, to the input velocity of the tug.\nAcknowledgments: This work was supported by the 111 Project (B16003).
