Permission required for all other uses.\nBackground: The heterogeneous nature of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) complicates the identification of the predictors of disease progression. We aimed to improve the prediction of disease progression in COPD by using machine learning and incorporating a rich dataset of phenotypic features.\nMethods: We included 4496 smokers with available data from their enrollment and 5-year follow-up visits in the COPD Genetic Epidemiology (COPDGene\u00ae) study. We constructed linear regression (LR) and supervised random forest models to predict 5-year progression in forced expiratory in 1 second (FEV1) from 46 baseline features. Using cross-validation, we randomly partitioned participants into training and testing samples. We also validated the results in the COPDGene 10-year follow-up visit.\nResults: Predicting the change in FEV1 over time is more challenging than simply predicting the future absolute FEV1 level. For random forest, R-squared was 0.15 and the area under the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves for the prediction of participants in the top quartile of observed progression was 0.71 (testing) and respectively, 0.10 and 0.70 (validation). Random forest provided slightly better performance than LR. The accuracy was best for Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease (GOLD) grades 1\u20132 participants, and it was harder to achieve accurate prediction in advanced stages of the disease. Predictive variables differed in their relative importance as well as for the predictions by GOLD.\nConclusion: Random forest, along with deep phenotyping, predicts FEV1 progression with reasonable accuracy. There is significant room for improvement in future models. This prediction model facilitates the identification of smokers at increased risk for rapid disease progression. Such findings may be useful in the selection of patient populations for targeted clinical trials.\nAbbreviations: chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD; COPD Genetic Epidemiology study, COPDGene\u00ae; linear regression, LR; forced expiratory volume in 1 second, FEV1; receiver operator characteristic, ROC; Global initiative for chronic Obstructive Lung Disease, GOLD; computed tomography, CT; annualized 5-year changes in FEV1, \u2206FEV1; root mean squared error, RMSE; increase in the mean squared errors, IncMSE; area under the curve, AUC; body mass index, BMI; low attenuation area below -950 Hounsfield units, %LAA-950; 15th percentile point, Perc15; forced vital capacity, FVC; modified Medical Research Council, mMRC; St George\u2019s Respiratory Questionnaire, SGRQ; preserved ratio-impaired spirometry, PRISm; interquartile, IQR; forced expiratory flow rate between 25% and 75% of the vital capacity, FEV25%-75% Funding Support: This work was supported by National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute K08 HL141601, R01 HL124233, R01 HL126596, R01 HL147326, U01 HL089897, and U01 HL089856.

The development of such therapies will be aided by improved tools for predicting disease progression, enabling the selection of high-risk groups for targeted treatment.\nPredictive models incorporate multiple sources of\nIntroduction\nKeywords:\nCOPD; disease progression; 5-year changes in FEV1; prediction; random forest machine learning\nThis article has an online data supplement.\ninformation to make patient-specific predictions and are widely used in multiple areas of medical practice. Existing models of disease progression in COPD have been limited in the scope of variables assessed.5-9 COPD exhibits significant variation in clinical and radiologic presentation as well as disease progression.6,10-12 This disease heterogeneity complicates the identification of the predictors of COPD progression and limits the accuracy of predictive models. Furthermore, COPD often progresses slowly over decades and true disease progression over short time periods can be difficult to detect with existing measurements.\nIn this study, we aimed to improve the prediction of COPD progression by applying machine learning to a rich dataset of clinical, demographic, patient-reported variables and imaging features in the COPD Genetic Epidemiology (COPDGene\u00ae) study. We hypothesized that deep phenotyping at the initial study visit along with random forest modeling, which exploits complex non-linear relationships and interactions among the risk factors, would facilitate the prediction of the rates of disease progression as measured by forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV1), a key aspect of COPD."

At the time of this analysis, 1833 smokers had completed their 10-year follow-up visit and had available 10-year spirometric and radiologic data. To predict their outcome values at Year 10 (Visit 3), we entered their 5-year (Visit 2) predictor data into the models trained in the derivation cohort. The FEV1 values for Visit 3 were observed. Our models were trained using only data from Visit 1 and Visit 2, where predictors were at Visit 1 and responses were Visit 2 values or the change in values between Visit 2 and Visit 1. In this setting, cross-validation was used to assess model performance. To provide further temporal validation of our models, we tested our already-trained models (no further parameter fitting) by using Visit 2 values for the predictors. This allowed us to compare the predicted Visit 3 values against the observed Visit 3 values to assess the accuracy of each prediction model in the temporal validation cohort.\nThe COPDGene study design, participant enrollment, and phenotype measurements have been previously reported13 and additional information is included in the online data supplement.\nOutcome Variables\nWe constructed models to predict annualized followup FEV1 and 5-year changes in FEV1 (\u2206FEV1). \u2206FEV1 (mL/year) was calculated by subtracting the Visit 1 value from the Visit 2 value and dividing by the time between Visit 1 and Visit 2. Negative values represent a lower value of the outcome at Visit 2 (i.e., worsening of the disease over the 5-year period with greater loss of FEV1). From the prediction models of \u2206FEV1, we also derived the prediction of Visit 2 FEV1 by adding the predicted 5-year change to the observed Visit 1 value."

This method can capture non-linear dependencies and has been shown to perform well for a range of tasks.15 It begins building each tree by randomly selecting participants for the tree with replacements (bootstrap samples). Participants not selected in bootstrapping represent the out-of-bag set. For each bootstrap sample, a decision tree is trained by recursive binary partition of the data until the minimum node size is reached. At each node split, an optimal feature (and its split-point) is identified from a randomly selected subset of features by minimizing a loss measure. The random selection of features reduces the correlation between trees, leading to variance reduction and improved generalization performance. It also allows a moderately informative feature to assert its importance to the prediction. Once an ensemble of trees is grown, the prediction for a new sample is made by aggregating predictions (e.g., averaging for regression and majority vote for classification) from individual trees.

Compared to participants in the bottom quartile of \u2206FEV1, those in the top quartile (rapid FEV1 progressors) had a higher proportion of males with less severe spirometric impairment at baseline but with higher exposure to smoking (pack years and percentage of current smoking), more advanced radiologic disease (total emphysema and gas trapping), more bronchodilator responsiveness, more dyspnea and chronic bronchitis symptoms, and a lower rate of obesity and metabolic syndrome. The many significant P-values support the alternative hypothesis and shed light on the factors that may be associated with or even contribute to the rapid FEV1 progression. The significant differences between the rapid and slow progressors also underpin the clinical relevance of identifying rapid progressors using a prediction model.\nThe median change in FEV1 was -37 (interquartile [IQR]: -66, -9)mL/year (Figure 2).

A schematic representation of our model is shown in Figure 3. The list of candidate predictors is provided in Table 2. In the cross-validation testing samples, on average, 89.6% of the variance in follow-up FEV1 values were explained and the AUC-ROC curves for the prediction of participants in the top quartile of observed disease progression was 0.97 (Table 3 and\nFigure 4). This high performance was maintained in the\ntemporal validation with an R-squared value of 0.91 and AUC of 0.98 (Table 3). For the prediction of the change in FEV1 over time (\u2206FEV1), the average R-squared value was 0.15 and AUC was 0.71 in the testing samples and respectively, 0.10 and 0.70 in the validation cohort.\nThe random forest model had slightly better performance for the prediction of \u2206FEV1 compared to linear regression (Table 3). The percentage of variance explained by random forest versus linear regression was 14.7% versus 12.3%. The indirect approach arithmetically transforms the predictions from modeling change in FEV1 to follow-up FEV1 predictions, and the best followup FEV1 prediction is achieved via an indirect approach with random forest modeling change in FEV1.

Predicting future FEV1 values is not the same as predicting the changes of FEV1 over the same period, since the \u2206FEV1 over a fixed time period generally contributes a relatively small amount to the overall variance of FEV1 at a given time point. Given the often gradual rate of progression of COPD, 5 years is a relatively short observation\nperiod, and one of the concerns is that the signal to noise ratio in our progression variables is insufficient for reliable prediction. To determine the signal-tonoise characteristics of our progression variables, we calculated the expected signal-to-noise ratio using previously published values19 of measurement error for FEV1. An important parameter in these calculations is the extent of correlation in errors between the 2 study measurements. Since empiric data were unavailable, we assumed independence between these errors; therefore, these estimates likely represent a lower bound on the proportion of noise in these measures. We estimated that measurement error accounted for at least 22% of the variance of \u2206FEV1 (calculations are included in the supplement). Thus, the theoretical upper bound for prediction performance of \u2206FEV1 was 78%."

Our prediction models for \u2206FEV1 represent the current state of the art for prediction of prospective change in FEV1. But there is significant room for improvement in future models. The most important predictive variables came from a wide range of clinical, spirometric, and imaging features. Baseline spirometry, CT-measured total lung volumes, and bronchodilator responsiveness dominated the prediction. In addition, the predictive performance and the relative importance of predictors differed by GOLD grade.\nSeveral screening tools are available to identify patients with undiagnosed COPD and to predict outcomes in patients with COPD.1,8,9,20-25 While Zafari et al and Chen et al developed and validated risk models to\nDiscussion Visit 1 and Visit 2 and 50.7% remained former smokers at Visit 1 and Visit 2.

Permission required for all other uses.\naccurately predict lung function trajectory,8,9 our study is the first to apply advanced machine learning methods, use an extensive set of phenotypic measurements and comorbidities, predict not only the follow-up values but also the more relevant change variables, and identify the relative importance of the predictors at various stages of the disease. With respect to the outcomes evaluated in these 2 papers, our predictive models gave similar performance for the prediction of future values of FEV1. Our study added the prediction of prospective changes in FEV1 that were not reported in these previously published studies. Predicting the change over time is more challenging than simply predicting the future value, since the change typically represents a small proportion of the overall variance in a given pair of FEV1 measurements separated by 5 years or less. However, it is important to assess the ability of models to predict prospective changes since this is an important outcome for clinical trials.\nGiven the superiority of non-linear models compared with linear models with regards to exploiting complex relationships and interactions among the risk factors,26 we chose random forest as our primary model due to its flexibility and generalizability, and the fact that the interpretation of decision trees are more natural to clinicians than some of the other black-box models. Despite hundreds of trees, the ensemble method (bagging) and the base learner (decision tree) in random forest are easier to understand and interpret than many other black-box models with more sophisticated ensemble methods (e.g., boosting) or base learners (e.g., kernels, neural networks).27 The similar performance of cross-validation and temporal validation attests to the generalizability of our models rather than overfitting, which would result in poor temporal validation performance compared to cross-validation performance. The sharp performance gap between predicting followup FEV1 and (rate of) change in FEV1 seems nonintuitive at first glance. To explain this in other terms, imagine that a predictive model for change in height was developed for a cohort of adults. A model that predicted \u201cheight 5 years from baseline\u201d by simply substituting the baseline height value would be very accurate, since there is little to no change in adult height over that timeframe. While FEV1 does change over a 5-year timeframe, the absolute amount of change is usually small relative to baseline FEV1 volumes. Thus, predicting the total FEV1 in 5 years is a much easier (but less clinically relevant) problem than predicting the change in FEV1 over 5 years. The key\nrationale is that 5 years is a short time period in terms of COPD progression, leading to a high correlation of FEV1 values between 2 visits (therefore, high prediction performance with follow-up FEV1) and a low signal-tonoise ratio in the FEV1 5-year progression measurements (hence, poor prediction performance with change in FEV1). Despite this, there may still be merit in modeling the change in FEV1 even with a short 5-year period, as we found a modest improvement in predicting followup FEV1 using models built to predict change in FEV1 that can then be transformed to follow-up FEV1 (median RMSE: 258.87 and 231.38 for follow-up FEV1 at Visit 2 and Visit 3, respectively). This improvement could be attributed to the change in FEV1 models taking into account the uneven time lapse between visits.\nRandom forests offer superior prediction of disease progression relative to linear regression, and this improved performance stems from the ability of these models to more efficiently capture non-linear interactions between predictors. The predictive accuracy of our models may potentially be further improved by including additional predictors (such as DLCO, pulmonary vascular measures, and relevant molecular biomarkers) and exploring other machine learning algorithms (such as deep learning). At present, these models are not ready for clinical use but could be useful in the design of COPD clinical trials to enrich the study populations by patients who are most likely to experience rapid disease progression and benefit from therapeutic interventions. For clinical use, better performing models that have been more extensively validated in multiple additional and relevant target populations are necessary.\nRapid decline in lung function has previously been associated with a range of factors such as smoking exposure, bronchodilator reversibility, higher baseline FEV1, higher baseline FVC, exacerbations in the prior year, low body mass index (BMI), African American race, female sex, emphysema, upper lobe emphysema predominance, and CT-detected small airway abnormalities.5,6,8,28-33 Our study detected several of these known COPD disease progression risk factors and identified other new predictors for FEV1 decline. Our study is the first, to our knowledge, to demonstrate that the patterns of predictors vary by GOLD spirometric grade. The intriguing variations in the importance of different risk factors depending on the studied subgroup may help inform further exploration of predictive risk factors and future development of new risk prediction algorithms.\njournal.copdfoundation.org JCOPDF \u00a9 2022 Volume 9 \u2022 Number 3 \u2022 2022\nFor personal use only. Permission required for all other uses.\nCompared to participants in the bottom quartile of \u2206FEV1, those in the top quartile (rapid FEV1 progressors) had less severe spirometric impairment and more advanced radiologic disease (total emphysema and gas trapping) at baseline. It is possible that the association of less severe spirometric impairment at baseline with more rapid FEV1 progression is an artifact related to the inability to lose sufficient FEV1 at the same rate compared to when disease is more severe (a physiologic floor in FEV1 which, once reached, results in a diminished FEV1 response to additional cigarette exposure). It is also possible that the association between more severe emphysema with more rapid FEV1 decline may represent a \u201cwinner\u2019s curse.\u201d However, it is important to note that baseline FEV1 was accounted for in our analyses as this variable was among the predictors in the prediction models. In addition, the fact that our cross-validation and temporal validation performances are similar argues against the presence of large winner\u2019s curse effects.\nThe relative unimportance of certain traditional risk factors such as COPD exacerbations in the prior year, selected comorbidities, race, and sex in our machine learning predictive models may be consistent with the disparate results from previous studies. For example, although some publications have suggested a significant excess loss of FEV1 for each COPD exacerbation,29,34,35 others have reported minimal 6 or no relationship.36 Such discrepancy may also result from differences in methodology between studies as well as differences in sample size, study duration, study population, and variable definitions. The relative unimportance of certain traditional risk factors in our models may also indicate that, while these risk factors may attain statistical significance in some models, they do not provide much additional predictive value after considering more important risk factors.\nDimensionality and collinearity are important factors to consider in building and interpreting prediction models. While our data has a reasonable dimensionality in respect to the sample size, random forest performs well with high dimensional data.37 Collinearity is more of a challenge for interpreting the feature relevance ratings than the prediction performance. It is worth noting that the permutation-based feature importance scores we utilized in this study capture the marginal importance of a feature; additional approaches for capturing conditional/partial feature importance in the presence of associated features have been proposed.18 However,\nthere is a heuristic component to these diverse feature importance scoring techniques, and there is currently no consensus or clear theoretical underpinning for them. It has been argued that there is a marginal-partial feature importance dimension, and the researcher must determine where he/she falls on this dimension based on his/her perspective on variable importance and the research question under consideration.38\nThe random forest\u2019s tunability of the number of trees hyperparameter has not been thoroughly investigated until recent years. For mean squared error loss in regression (and other loss functions in classification), it has been theoretically proven that increasing the number of trees does not lead to overfitting and that setting it to a computationally feasible large number is more favored than tuning the hyperparameter.39 Setting the number of trees to the default of 500 provided a good compromise between performance and computational efficiency in our datasets.\nThis study has a number of strengths. Analyses were performed within a well-characterized cohort that included participants at all stages of disease severity. In addition, by focusing on prediction rather than the study of individual risk factors, our results provide useful context regarding the relative importance of specific predictors. By constructing models in participants stratified by GOLD spirometric grade, we demonstrated that patterns of optimal predictors vary by specific disease outcome and GOLD grade. Validation of our findings in the temporal cohort represents another strength of our paper.\nOur study also has limitations. We only used 2 measurements of lung function separated by approximately 5 years. The large sample size available helped to overcome some of the inherent challenges in low signal-to-noise ratio with studies of COPD progression over a relatively short period of time. However, with longer follow-up and more measurements in future studies, we will be better able to isolate measurement noise from real disease progression which will result in greater predictive accuracy. Our analysis was based on participants who had completed their second study visit, and it is possible that patients who were lost to follow-up differed from those available for analysis. Many of the patients with airflow obstruction were receiving therapy for their disease. Although no existing pharmacotherapy has been conclusively shown to affect the rates of disease progression, this still may\njournal.copdfoundation.org JCOPDF \u00a9 2022 Volume 9 \u2022 Number 3 \u2022 2022\nFor personal use only.
