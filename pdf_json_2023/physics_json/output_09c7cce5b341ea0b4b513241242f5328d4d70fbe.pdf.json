The intensity of N-CDs rapidly increased in acidic environment (pH scale ranged from 1 to 7) and reached the maximum value at neutral environment (pH of 7), then gradually decreased in alkaline condition (pH scale ranged from 7 to 14) (Fig. 5a).

As shown in Fig. 6a, our NCDs only responded to metronidazole, not other substances, indicating the high selectivity for metronidazole identication. Furthermore, the interference experiments by mixing metronidazole and other substances were performed. As excepted, the addition of a coexistent interference substance didn't impact the uorescence quenching effect caused by metronidazole (Fig. 6b). Overall, the results further demonstrated that our N-CDs had high selectivity for metronidazole detection.\nNext, the sensitivity of N-CDs for metronidazole detection was test. As shown in Fig. 7a, under 434 nm wavelength, with increased concentration of metronidazole (from 0 to 179 mM), the intensity of N-CDs gradually diminished.

In addition, metronidazole content in commercial metronidazole tablets were successfully detected with high accuracy. Furthermore, we discovered that the IFE could be the possible quenching mechanism of MTZ detection. Above all, our N-CDs demonstrated their potential to detect metronidazole without any special instrument."
