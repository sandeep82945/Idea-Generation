    "abstractText": "The dichloromethane extract of the roots of Bridelia balansae Tutcher (Phyllanthaceae) was found to show potential anticancer activity against HCT116 colorectal cancer cell. Our bioassayguided phytochemical investigation of the roots of B. balansae led to the identification of 14 compounds including seven lignans (1\u20137), three phenylbenzene derivatives (8\u201310), two flavanone (11\u201312), and two triterpenoids (13\u201314). Among them, 4\u2032-demethyl-4-deoxypodophyllotoxin (1) is the first aryltetralin lignan compound identified from this plant species. In addition, the stereochemistry of 1 was validated by X-ray crystallography for the first time, and its distinguished cytotoxic effect on HCT116 cells with an IC50 value at 20 nM was induced via an apoptosis induction mechanism. Compound 1 could also significantly decrease the migration rate of HCT116 cells, indicating its potential application against cancer metastasis. The western blot analysis showed that 1 has the potential to inhibit cell proliferation and metastasis. Treatment of 1 resulted in the downregulation of matrix metalloproteinases 2 (MMP2) and p-Akt, while p21 was upregulated. Collectively, the present study on the phytochemical and biological profile of B. balansae has determined the plant as a useful source to produce promising anticancer lead compounds.",

With classical natural product chemistry methodologies, a variety of bioactive compounds from natural product resources have been discovered as current drug candidates [1,3]. These therapeutic areas include cardiovascular diseases [4] and multiple sclerosis [5], but cancer and infectious diseases remain the therapeutic areas of which natural products made the major contributions [6,7]. Specifically, over 60% of currently used anticancer agents are derived from natural products, and intensive studies by a random selection screening program funded by the United States National Cancer Institute (NCI) led to the discovery and development of important chemotherapeutics such as the vinca alkaloids, vinblastine, vincristine, and the isolation of the cytotoxic podophyllotoxins [8,9]. The plant genus Bridelia, mainly distributed in tropical and subtropical regions of the Africa and Asia, belongs to the Phyllanthaceae family (formerly Euphorbiaceae) with approximately 60 species [10]. Among them, a dozen species of Bridelia genus have been used as traditional folk and ethnic medicinal plants in Africa and southeast Asia countries, for the treatment of infective diseases caused by parasitic, bacterial, malarial, viral, oral, or\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6165. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28166165 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6165 2 of 13\nsexual pathogens, glucometabolic and bowel disorders, arthritis [10], and hypertension [11]. They can also be used as analgesics, antianemic purposes, anticonvulsants [10], poison antidotes [12], and antioxidatives [13], or for the purposes of wound healing [12], relieving itching [13], and resolving cough, fever, and jaundice [14]. Consistent with their traditional use, the crude extracts from this plant genus have been reported to have a wide range of bioactivities including potential anticancer activities [15,16]. However, the study of the substance basis of pharmacological effects are rarely involved. The dichloromethane fraction of the roots of Bridelia balansae Tutcher was found to show potential anticancer activity, with an IC50 value of 0.79 \u00b5g/mL against human colorectal carcinoma cells HCT116. According to APG III System, B. balansae belongs to the Phyllanthaceae family, and could be found mainly in Lingnan area of China, including Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Hainan, Sichuan, Taiwan, and Yunnan Province, together with other countries in Asia such as Japan (Ryukyu Islands), Laos, and Vietnam. It has been used as a folk medicine to treat gastropathy and glometulonephropathy in China [17], but there is no prior report of the bioactivity of the chemical constituents from this plant. Thus, we are encouraged to carry out further phytochemical studies to discover bioactive compounds from this plant based on the potent bioactivity of the plant extract. Herein, we describe the isolation, structural identification, and biological activity evaluation of the compounds obtained from B. balansae."

The prior absolute stereochemistry of 1 was only established by using NMR method since it was first discovered in 1984, and no X-ray crystallographic data have been reported so far to validate the absolute configuration [18]. Considering the chirality diversity of the carbon skeleton of aryltetralin lignans, we nurtured the fine crystals of 1 from acetone to obtain high-quality X-ray crystallographic data with CuK\u03b1 radiation. The resulted Flack parameter of 0.13 (17) from the refinement of the X-ray data, together with the comparison of the reported optical rotation data of podophyllotoxin [32], confirmed the absolute stereochemistry of 1 (Figure 2). In addition, we measured the melting point (248.5\u2013249.0 \u25e6C) and the optical rotation ([\u03b1]20D =\u221296\u25e6, c = 0.3, CHCl3) of 1, which are consistent with the literature report [19]. The isolated and purified compounds are stored at\u221280 \u25e6C and then dissolved into DMSO for treatment. Dissolved compounds were stored at\u221220 \u25e6C. Through a bioassay-guided phytochemical investigation of the roots of B. balansae, we were able to identify seven lignans, three phenylbenzene derivatives, two flavanone, and two triterpenoids.

            "text": "In previous studies, the investigations on Bridelia plant genus mainly focused on the validation of the folk or ethnic medical application using the crude extracts [10\u201313]. In the present study, we in-depth investigated the major phytochemical profile of the roots of Bridelia balansae by bioassay guided separation. The 14 compounds that were identified belong to aryltetralin [18\u201322] and 2-aryltetrahydrofuran [23\u201325] lignans, organic tannic acids [26\u201328], flavanones [29,30], and triterpenoids [31]. Although these compounds are known, these findings expanded the diversity of the plant sources of these bioactive compounds. More importantly, the absolute configuration of the lactone ring is difficult to confirm by the regular HRMS and NMR spectroscopies in terms of aryltetralin skeletons in some extreme cases. The confirmation of the absolute structure of compound 1 by X-ray crystallography method for the first time is beneficial to the structural determination of future unknown natural analogues. In addition, flavonoid\u2013tannin conjugates are a rare subtype of small molecules in nature. As an important precursor of podophyllotoxin, aryltetralin lignans also exhibited a pronounced biological activity mainly as anti-tumor agents.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 6165 7 of 13\nConsidering the synthetic challenges due to multiple chiral centers, natural aryltetralin lignans isolated from the roots of Bridelia balansae can partially overcome the shortage of chemical sources, which will provide the substantial support of further pharmacological studies. In the present study, we also evaluated the bioactivity of compound 1 in depth, including the elucidation of its anti-proliferative property, and its induction of apoptosis and migration using cellular platforms. Previously, it has been reported that 4\u2032-demethyl4-deoxypodophyllotoxin (1) could induce cell cycle arrest with a significantly increased G2/M peak after treatment of HCT-116 cells [33]. Cell cycle arrest could either provide cancer cells the opportunity for DNA damage repair, or lead to cell death [34]. Among all the cell death pathways, apoptosis is one of the most common mechanisms to eliminate damaged cells that will further restrict tumorigenesis [35]. The data of our flow cytometric analysis show that the anti-proliferative effect of 1 on human colorectal carcinoma cells is primarily derived from apoptosis. The apoptosis is mediated by the upregulation of p21 and might be caused by the effects of microtubule disassembly of 1. This result is consistent with podophyllotoxin, an aryltetralin lignan congener of 1 and a well-known microtubule-destabilizing agent [36,37]. In the present study, compound 1 was found to induce a significant apoptosis event. Thus, further research is needed to determine if the aryltetralin lignan-induced apoptotic pathway is linked to the mechanism of action of the microtubule-destabilizing agents, such as the clinically used anticancer drugs etoposide and teniposide, which are derived from podophyllotoxin. Notably, it has been reported that targeted microtubule disruption can selectively inhibit metastasis, although these therapies are currently focusing exclusively on tumor growth [38]. Therefore, the antimigration effects of 1 might also be contributed to by its microtubule disruption effects. These effects collectively regulated MMP2, and thus induced the reduction of cell migration. We also noticed a significant dose-dependent decrease of the expression of phosphorylated AKT, which is the upstream of both p21 and MMP2. It has been well acknowledged that AKT signaling promotes tumor cell proliferation, growth, and metastasis by activating its downstream effectors, and thus the inhibitors targeting this signaling pathway have been considered as the most effective treatment strategy for cancer [39]. The wound healing (or scratch) assay is a method to measure two-dimensional cell migration [40]. It involves creating an artificial gap in a confluent cell monolayer at 0 h, and tracking the movement of HCT116 cells through microscopy imaging at both 0 and 24 h. The narrowing of the gap indicated that compound 1 was capable of inhibiting the migration of HCT116 cells. Collectively, our study provides a basis for the anti-cancer effects of compound 1 against HCT116 cancer cells, which might lead to further structural modification of its functional groups or more detailed investigations of its mechanism, serving as a potential lead compound in colon cancer treatment."

Among them, 3 has not been reported in nature previously, and 1 is the first aryltetralin lignan compound identified from this plant species. In addition, the absolute configuration of 1 was validated by X-ray crystallography for the first time, and its distinguished cytotoxic effect on HCT116 cells with an IC50 value at 20 nM was induced via an apoptosis induction mechanism. Compound 1 could also significantly decrease the migration rate of HCT116 cells, indicating its potential application against cancer metastasis. Collectively, the present study on the phytochemical and biological profile of B. balansae has determined the plant as a useful source to produce promising anticancer lead compounds.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https://www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28166165/s1, Figure S1: The proton NMR spectrum of compound 1; Figure S2: The 13carbon NMR spectrum of compound 1; Figure S3: The DEPT135 NMR spectrum of compound 1; Figure S4: The HSQC NMR spectrum of compound 1; Figure S5: The HMBC NMR spectrum of compound 1; Figure S6: The 1H-1H COSY NMR spectrum of compound 1; Figure S7: The NOESY NMR spectrum of compound 1; Figure S8: The extraction and fraction flow chart of air-dried root of B.
