conclusion We present a game-theoretic market framework for procuring flexibility services within the distribution network. To address the privacy concerns of market participants and the associated information sharing limitations, we adapt a semidecentralized GNE-seeking algorithm to solve the formulated game. Through numerical experiments, we assess the performance of our proposed mechanism in terms of both economic efficiency and operational security.
