    "abstractText": "Tellurite is highly toxic to bacteria and commonly used in the clinical screening for pathogens; it is speculated that there is a potential relationship between tellurite resistance and bacterial pathogenicity. Until now, the core function genes of tellurite resistance and their characteristics are still obscure. Pseudomonas citronellolis SJTE-3 was found able to resist high concentrations of tellurite (250 \u03bcg/mL) and formed vacuole-like tellurium nanostructures. The terZABCDE gene cluster located in the large plasmid pRBL16 endowed strain SJTE-3 with the tellurite resistance of high levels. Although the terC and terD genes were identified as the core function genes for tellurite reduction and resistance, the inhibition of cell growth was observed when they were used solely. Interestingly, co-expression of the terA gene or terZ gene could relieve the burden caused by the expression of the terCD genes and recover normal cell growth. TerC and TerD proteins commonly shared the conserved sequences and are widely distributed in many pathogenic bacteria, highly associated with the pathogenicity factors.",

            "text": "Tellurium (Te) is a rare metalloid that belongs to the chalcogen family, whose abundance is relatively low in the earth\u2019s crust (about 0.027 ppm) [1]. As a p-type semiconductor, Te is commonly used in the manufacture of solar panels, glass, rubber, photocopiers, and metal alloys [2\u20134]. It was considered one of the two most important materials according to the Materials Genome Initiative launched by the United States of America. In nature, tellurium is mostly in the form of alloys with other metals like copper. Tellurite (TeO32\u2212) and tellurate (TeO42\u2212) are the most common forms of tellurium in ecological environments [5,6]. Tellurite is highly toxic to various creatures, especially bacteria. Very low concentration (1 \u00b5g/mL) of tellurite can severely inhibit cell growth of E. coli, much lower than that of heavy metal ions [7]. Therefore, tellurite has been used as an antibacterial agent before the use of penicillin. Several hypotheses have been presented to explain the toxicity mechanism of tellurite to bacteria, and therein ROS stress is supposed to play a major role in tellurite toxicity [8\u201312]. Meanwhile, some microorganisms have been found with the tellurite-resistance capability. Several pathogenic bacteria like E. coli O157:H7, Diphtheria bacillus, Staphylococcus aureus, Shigella spp., and Streptococcus pneumoniae showed different resistance to tellurite [7]. In fact, tellurite has been effectively and widely used for the screening of highly pathogenic microbes in clinical tests for over 50 years [7]. When streaked on the tellurite-amended\nMicroorganisms 2022, 10, 95. https://doi.org/10.3390/microorganisms10010095 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/microorganisms\nMicroorganisms 2022, 10, 95 2 of 16\nplates, the pathogenic strains can reduce tellurite into the elemental Te particles and appear as black or grey colonies. It implied that these pathogenic strains may contain specific genes functioning in the transportation and reduction of tellurite. The potential genes responsible for tellurite resistance were first identified in bacteria, and their homologs were also found in over 50 different species including plants and animals. The reported tellurite-resistance genes and gene clusters include pacB, tmp, tehAB, kilAtelAB, arsABC, narGHI, trgABcysK, and terZABCDE; the combination of potential tellurite-resistance genes varied greatly in different strains [11,13\u201318]. The terZABCDE gene cluster is considered as an intact gene cluster for tellurite resistance, ensuring the highest tellurite resistance with the minimal inhibition concentration (MIC) of 1024 \u00b5g/mL, which has been identified in various pathogens like the enteropathogenic E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and Y. pestis [18]. Several attempts have been performed to study the functions of tellurite-resistance genes and clarify their roles. The membrane protein TerC was classified into LysE superfamily, which is related to the export of manganese; a riboswitch responding to manganese ions was also found upstream of the terC gene [19,20]. TerC was speculated to participate in the transportation of tellurite within and outside cells [21]. The TerB protein from K. pneumoniae was the first tellurite-resistance protein with the resolved structure, containing the N-terminal positively charged domain and the C-terminal negatively charged domain [22]. The TerD protein from K. pneumoniae able to bind Ca2+ and the Ca2+ signaling was supposed to play a role in the bacterial tellurite resistance [23]. Besides, several genes involved in cysteine metabolism are also considered to be probably associated with tellurite resistance [12]. However, although several tellurite resistance genes have been analyzed, the role of each gene and the core function genes is still obscure. Pseudomonas. citronellosis is one species isolated from the natural environment and the reported strains are the nonpathogenic gram-negative bacteria [24]. P. citronellosis SJTE-3 is found with efficient pollutant-degrading capacities and contains a terZABCDE gene cluster in its plasmid pRBL16 [25,26]. In this work, the tellurite-resistance properties of P. citronellolis SJTE-3 were studied, and the core function genes for tellurite resistance were identified. The conservation and distribution of core tellurite-resistance genes were further analyzed; the conceivable relevance of tellurite resistance and bacterial pathogenicity was also discussed. The findings can facilitate the elucidation of bacterial tellurite-resistance mechanism and the clarification of its function in pathogens."

            "text": "Due to its high toxicity to bacteria, tellurite has been used as an antibacterial agent and in clinical screening for highly pathogenic strains [7]. The terZABCDE gene cluster for tellurite resistance has been found located in plasmid DNA or chromosome DNA of many microorganisms, sharing conserved sequences and close origin [18,35\u201337]. Although the tellurite-resistance genes are supposedly highly relevant to pathogenicity, the core function genes for tellurite resistance and its genetic relevance between tellurite resistance and bacterial pathogenicity are indistinct [30,36,38\u201342]. The tellurite-resistance gene cluster (terZABCDE) in P. citronellolis SJTE-3 was found in its plasmid pRBL16, which was classified as pBT2436-like megaplasmid commonly existed in pathogens; and the tellurite-resistance genes were identified as part of the core genes in this megaplasmid family. However, plasmid pRBL16 was isolated from non-human sources and lack of any antimicrobial resistance genes [31]. Therefore, the pathogenic origination\nMicroorganisms 2022, 10, 95 12 of 16\nof plasmid pRBL16 and nonpathogenic properties of P. citronellolis make strain SJTE-3 as an ideal candidate for the study of core function genes for tellurite resistance. The terCD genes were identified as the core function gene for the high-level resistance to tellurite in P. citronellolis SJTE-3, although their overexpression caused obvious retardation in cell growth. Recombinant plasmids carrying terCE genes endowed cells with high tellurite resistance, similar to plasmids containing terCD genes did (Table 2). As TerD and TerE are homologous proteins, it is supposed that they derived from gene duplication and executed similar functions. On the other hand, the co-existence of TerD and TerE implied that a single terD gene may not be sufficient to achieve efficient tellurite resistance. It was also noticed that the recombinant strains containing terE gene usually showed weaker tellurite resistance and formed smaller colonies than those with terD gene, implying the similar but not identical function of terD and terE genes. The growth burden observed in strains containing terCD genes may be due to the lack of regulatory factors or unknown detoxic factors for the integrity of the gene cluster [43]. This cell growth burden could be rescued when the terA gene or terZ gene was co-expressed with terCD genes. All the transformants containing terACD or terZCD in plasmid showed vigorous cell growth and high tellurite resistance. Therefore, terA and terZ genes were supposedly important for tellurite resistance as well. The TerA and TerZ proteins are classified as TerD family proteins according to their conserved TerD-like domains. TerA protein contains a TerD-like super-family domain, a TerD-like domain, and two putative metal-binding sites; TerZ protein contains a TerD-like domain and a putative metal-binding site. It implied that the TerD-like domain and metal ions may be important for the improvement of bacterial cell state to resist tellurite. TerB protein previously was considered as a central unit of the terZABCDE gene cluster [44]. However, our results indicated that terB gene in P. citronellolis SJTE-3 was not necessary for the acquisition of tellurite resistance of E. coli MG1655 (Table 2). TerC protein is a hydrophobic protein and was speculated as a membrane protein probably involved in the transportation of tellurite [21]. It is also the only membrane protein in terZABCDE gene cluster, implying its function may be irreplaceable. Proteomics analysis of TerC interactome suggests that the TerC-TerB complex may act as the central unit, and TerD may participate in tellurite resistance via a TerC-independent action [44]. Structure analysis of TerD protein from K. pneumoniae showed that there are two Ca2+ binding sites in this protein, the Ca1 site (formed by residues 40, 41, 42, 78, 79, and 89) and the Ca2 site (formed by residues 29, 82, 84, and 88) [23]. MSA analysis in this work showed that the predicted metal-binding sites of TerD are conserved through different species. It suggested that the binding of Ca2+ was probably vital for the function of TerD protein, which may be regulated by the calcium signal transduction [23]. In fact, terC and terD genes in different species are identified with various functions. The TerC homologue identified in the thylakoid membrane of Arabidopsis thaliana was proposed to play a key role in the formation of chloroplast [45,46]. The terC genes from various bacteria were located in the downstream of yybP-ykoY magnesium ions responsive riboswitch, and TerC protein also shows high similarity to manganese transporter MntP and MneA, suggesting that TerC may be involved in the metal transportation in bacteria [19,20]. Although it is hard to precisely predict the role of TerC in tellurite resistance, it seems that TerC protein was vital for the transportation of tellurite and other metal ions in bacteria. The TerD protein has been found to participate in the differentiation, cell growth, and spores forming of S. coelicolor [47]. It also is supported by the growth improvement of TerD-like proteins (TerA and TerZ) to the TerCD-containing cells in this work. Therefore, TerC and TerD proteins have versatile functions and tellurite resistance may be one of their functions [18,41,42]. In bacteria, terZABCDE genes also are involved in the resistance to bacteriophages, the phagocytosis by macrophages, the tolerance to oxidative stresses and colicins, the adherence to epithelial cells and the formation of filamentous morphology [33,35,38,48\u201351]. When the terZABCDE gene cluster from Clostridium acetobutylicum was expressed in E. coli recA\nMicroorganisms 2022, 10, 95 13 of 16\nmutant, cells even showed resistance to mitomycin C and methyl methanesulfonate [52]. Meanwhile, the terD and terE genes of Y. pestis were up-regulated when the bacteria proliferated in mouse macrophage phagolysosomes [53]. The transcription levels of terA and terC genes in E. coli EDL933 cells in human macrophages were also elevated [54]. These suggested that there may exist a potential relationship in tellurite resistance and cell survival during the bacterial infection process. The plasmid pRBL16 in strain SJTE-3 is a member of the pBT2436-like megaplasmid family (>420 kb), normally carrying large arrays of antibiotic resistance genes in discrete, complex, and dynamic resistance regions. The members of this megaplasmid family normally share a common backbone, while plasmid pRBL16 lacks the AMR genes, implying it is quite flexible in the adaptive traits [31]. Furthermore, the concomitant distribution of terCD genes and the pathogenic related genes supported the relevance of tellurite resistance and microbial pathogenicity. It is noticed that strain SJTE-3\u2206pRBL16 still showed tellurite resistance of about 40 \u00b5g/mL, which may be due to the existence of part of arsABC genes, narGHI genes and cysK gene in its genome [29\u201331]. Other genes for stress resistance factors in Pseudomonas spp. may also contribute to tellurite resistance of strain SJTE-3\u2206pRBL16. In addition, nanoparticles of elemental tellurium are useful in various fields like optic and electronic devices, and the Te nanoparticles reduced by microorganisms formed different structures such as nanorods, nanowires, nanotubes, and nanodots. P. citronellolis SJTE-3 has good environmental adaptability and robust performance, which can be used as a good candidate for tellurium bioproduction [25,26]. The nanostructures of tellurium formed in strain SJTE-3 cells are mostly uniform, spherical, or oval-shaped, with a diameter of about 100 nm, while the tellurium particles formed in E. coli cells were relatively loose and small. This may be due to higher tellurite concentration or stronger reductive enzyme activities in SJTE-3 cells. As most of the biosynthesized nanostructures of tellurium are wirelike, tubelike, and crystalline, the unusual vascular shape of tellurium nanostructures formed by strain SJTE-3 provided a new choice for the biosynthesis of this nanoparticle [2,55]."
