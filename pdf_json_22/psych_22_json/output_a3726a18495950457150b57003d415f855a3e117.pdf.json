    "abstractText": "Background: Digital media has made screen time more available across multiple contexts, but our understanding of the ways children and families use digital media has lagged behind the rapid adoption of this technology. Objective: This study evaluated the feasibility of an intensive longitudinal data collection protocol to objectively measure digital media use, physical activity, sleep, sedentary behavior, and socioemotional context among caregiver-child dyads. This paper also describes preliminary convergent validity of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) measures and preliminary agreement between caregiver self-reported phone use and phone use collected from passive mobile sensing. Methods: Caregivers and their preschool-aged child (3-5 years) were recruited to complete a 30-day assessment protocol. Within 30-days, caregivers completed 7 days of EMA to measure child behavior problems and caregiver stress. Caregivers and children wore an Axivity AX3 (Newcastle Upon Tyne) accelerometer to assess physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep. Phone use was assessed via passive mobile sensing; we used Chronicle for Android users and screenshots of iOS screen time metrics for iOS users. Participants were invited to complete a second 14-day protocol approximately 3-12 months after their first assessment. We used Pearson correlations to examine preliminary convergent validity between validated questionnaire measures of caregiver psychological functioning, child behavior, and EMA items. Root mean square errors were computed to examine the preliminary agreement between caregiver self-reported phone use and objective phone use. Results: Of 110 consenting participants, 105 completed all protocols (105/110, 95.5% retention rate). Compliance was defined a priori as completing \u226570%-75% of each protocol task. There were high compliance rates for passive mobile sensing for both Android (38/40, 95%) and iOS (64/65, 98%). EMA compliance was high (105/105, 100%), but fewer caregivers and children were compliant with accelerometry (62/99, 63% and 40/100, 40%, respectively). Average daily phone use was 383.4 (SD 157.0) minutes for Android users and 354.7 (SD 137.6) minutes for iOS users. There was poor agreement between objective and caregiver self-reported phone use; root mean square errors were 157.1 and 81.4 for Android and iOS users, respectively. Among families who completed the first assessment, 91 re-enrolled to complete the protocol a second time, approximately 7 months later (91/105, 86.7% retention rate). Conclusions: It is feasible to collect intensive longitudinal data on objective digital media use simultaneously with accelerometry and EMA from an economically and racially diverse sample of families with preschool-aged children. The high compliance and retention of the study sample are encouraging signs that these methods of intensive longitudinal data collection can be completed in a longitudinal cohort study. The lack of agreement between self-reported and objectively measured mobile phone use highlights the need for additional research using objective methods to measure digital media use.

This paper also describes preliminary convergent validity of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) measures and preliminary agreement between caregiver self-reported phone use and phone use collected from passive mobile sensing.\nMethods: Caregivers and their preschool-aged child (3-5 years) were recruited to complete a 30-day assessment protocol. Within 30-days, caregivers completed 7 days of EMA to measure child behavior problems and caregiver stress. Caregivers and children wore an Axivity AX3 (Newcastle Upon Tyne) accelerometer to assess physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep. Phone use was assessed via passive mobile sensing; we used Chronicle for Android users and screenshots of iOS screen time metrics for iOS users. Participants were invited to complete a second 14-day protocol approximately 3-12 months after their first assessment. We used Pearson correlations to examine preliminary convergent validity between validated questionnaire measures of caregiver psychological functioning, child behavior, and EMA items. Root mean square errors were computed to examine the preliminary agreement between caregiver self-reported phone use and objective phone use.\nResults: Of 110 consenting participants, 105 completed all protocols (105/110, 95.5% retention rate). Compliance was defined a priori as completing \u226570%-75% of each protocol task. There were high compliance rates for passive mobile sensing for both Android (38/40, 95%) and iOS (64/65, 98%). EMA compliance was high (105/105, 100%), but fewer caregivers and children were compliant with accelerometry (62/99, 63% and 40/100, 40%, respectively). Average daily phone use was 383.4 (SD 157.0) minutes for Android users and 354.7 (SD 137.6) minutes for iOS users. There was poor agreement between objective and caregiver self-reported phone use; root mean square errors were 157.1 and 81.4 for Android and iOS users, respectively. Among families who completed the first assessment, 91 re-enrolled to complete the protocol a second time, approximately 7 months later (91/105, 86.7% retention rate).\nConclusions: It is feasible to collect intensive longitudinal data on objective digital media use simultaneously with accelerometry and EMA from an economically and racially diverse sample of families with preschool-aged children. The high compliance and retention of the study sample are encouraging signs that these methods of intensive longitudinal data collection can be completed in a longitudinal cohort study. The lack of agreement between self-reported and objectively measured mobile phone use highlights the need for additional research using objective methods to measure digital media use.\nInternational Registered Report Identifier (IRRID): RR2-36240\n(JMIR Form Res 2022;6(9):e40572) doi: 10.2196/40572\nJMIR Form Res 2022 | vol. 6 | iss. 9 | e40572 | p. 1https://formative.jmir.org/2022/9/e40572 (page number not for citation purposes)\nXSL\u2022FO RenderX"

Few preschool-aged children meet the World Health Organization\u2019s recommendation \u22641 hour of screen time per day [5,6]. This is partly attributable to the rapid growth of digital media technology, which makes screens more available across multiple contexts [7,8]. Unfortunately, our understanding of the unique ways in which children and families use digital media has lagged behind the rapid adoption of this technology. Therefore, we need updated paradigms to understand how families use digital media and how it impacts their health.\nResearch on digital media use (defined here as tablet or mobile phone use) has been hindered by methodological limitations, including a reliance on retrospective self-reported measures (which are subject to recall and desirability biases) [9-11] and a tendency to overlook momentary etiological processes occurring within each day [10]. The limited research on within-day time-varying contexts (ie, child behavior and parenting stress) that influence digital media use in specific situations leads to a coarse understanding of the mechanisms underlying the link between screen time and behavioral health outcomes.\nParents allow children to use digital media for a variety of reasons (eg, to provide relief from caregiving, and to modify behavior) [12], and the decisions parents make regarding how and when they use digital media must balance the immediate needs of themselves and their children. The parent-child processes around digital media use are likely bidirectional, where child factors (ie, behavior problems) and digital media habits influence each other through a transactional process. For example, parents might use digital media to soothe or distract a fussy child [13], which reduces the frequency of enriching parent-child interactions [14-16] and contributes to continued behavioral difficulties [17,18], which in turn predict greater digital media exposure. The importance of understanding behavioral patterns that vary across contexts and families lies in the ability to identify the most salient causal pathways that can be used to develop individualized, tailored, and targeted intervention strategies [19]. Accurate and acceptable measurement of digital media use is necessary to elucidate the potentially unique mechanisms underlying digital media use and health behaviors.\nTechnological advances in passive mobile sensing have made it possible to access data already collected by mobile devices (ie, app use) to objectively measure digital media use [20,21]. By integrating intensive longitudinal data collected from multiple sources (ie, passive mobile screen time sensing, ecological momentary assessment [EMA], and accelerometry), we can reveal the process-oriented science that underlies the association between mobile phone use and other health\nbehaviors (ie, sleep and activity) and socioemotional health (ie, behavior problems) [22]. To our knowledge, no studies to date have leveraged a combination of EMA, accelerometry, and passive mobile sensing capabilities to specifically study digital media use among families with young children [11,23]. It is unclear whether this combination of methods can be successfully used to gather meaningful information about the digital media use of children and families."

The entire study protocol was administered twice (both instances being an average of 7 months apart) to examine the feasibility of recruiting and retaining a cohort willing to complete the protocol multiple times. Additional aims of this study were to describe the convergent validity of EMA measures and to describe preliminary agreement between caregiver self-reported digital media use and mobile phone use collected from passive mobile sensing."

Caregivers completed EMAs for 7 days to measure child behavior problems, caregiver stress, and child screen time. Each day 4 signal-contingent EMAs were delivered to caregivers\u2019 mobile phones between 8:30 AM and 9 PM. The surveys expired after 2 hours and were delivered such that no overlapping time windows could exist. EMA assessments were conducted in the first week of the 30-day monitoring window. Additional details, including a full list of EMA questions, can be found elsewhere [26]. In addition, caregivers and children were asked to wear an Axivity AX3 accelerometer (Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom) on their nondominant wrist for 24 hours per day (including while bathing and swimming) for 30 days to assess physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep. Nondominant wrist placement has been shown to improve compliance rates compared with waist placement [27]. Data were processed using GGIR (version 2.5.1) [28] in R (R Foundation for Statistical Computing). Mobile phone use over 30 days differed based on whether the caregiver used an iOS or an Android device. For participants with an Android device, we used Chronicle [29], an app designed specifically for passive screen time monitoring of Android devices. Caregivers were sent a link to download the app and asked to allow it to run on their phone during the study period and delete it after 30 days. Caregivers with an iOS phone were texted an automated reminder to send a screenshot\nof their screen time use each day at 9 PM to a study-specific phone number. If a caregiver failed to send a correct screenshot during the 7 days of EMAs, study staff sent a personalized SMS text message within 24 hours. After the 7-day EMA period, study staff sent a personalized SMS text message if a caregiver failed to send a screenshot on 2 consecutive days (48 hours). Participants were compensated up to US $180 for their participation in each wave of data collection (US $360 in total; see [26] for more details). The number of reminders to send images was recorded as an indicator of feasibility. The use of technical support (participant use of research staff technical support as well as research staff requests from Chronicle support staff) was included as a screen time feasibility outcome. We attempted to conduct semistructured qualitative interviews with all participants who dropped out of the study."

The second wave was conducted to examine the feasibility of retaining a cohort sample and to assess the longer-term acceptability of the protocol in its entirety. Several protocol adjustments were made between waves 1 and 2 based on participant feedback from wave 1. Most notably, the monitoring period for EMA was increased from 7 to 14 days, and accelerometry and passive mobile sensing were shortened from 30 to 14 days to align with the EMA protocol. Logistically, shortening the accelerometer protocol allowed us to invite all participants to re-enroll in the second wave of data collection (only 50/100, 50% was initially proposed). In addition, Qustodio was used to passively monitor iOS devices (phones and tablets) and Amazon Kindle Fire tablets (a description of Qustodio is provided in the following section).\nDuring the second wave of data collection, the study team began using Qustodio, a commercially available passive sensing app that allows a third party (ie, parents) to monitor the timing, duration, and content of digital media. Starting in October 2021, caregivers were invited to allow the research team to monitor their child\u2019s tablets (Kindle and iOS devices) using the media monitoring system, Qustodio. Starting in January 2022, caregivers with iOS devices were also asked to download Qustodio for passive mobile sensing instead of uploading screenshots, as was done in wave 1. To monitor devices with Qustodio, caregivers were sent a link to download the app. Participants with iOS devices were sent additional instructions to install a mobile configuration, as iOS did not allow third-party apps to monitor screen use directly. A research assistant worked with caregivers over the phone to complete the enrollment. Unlike Chronicle, each Qustodio enrollment required direct assistance from a member of the research team via call or text messaging (approximately 10 minutes per participant). Caregivers were instructed to delete the app and mobile configuration and unenroll after the study period (14 days). Enrollment of a child device was presented as optional for additional compensation, and the number of caregivers who agreed to enroll, number of successful enrollments, and number of days of data were collected as feasibility metrics.\nJMIR Form Res 2022 | vol. 6 | iss. 9 | e40572 | p. 3https://formative.jmir.org/2022/9/e40572 (page number not for citation purposes)\nXSL\u2022FO RenderX"

For iOS users, this entailed texting at least 21 (wave 1) screen-use images and 10 (wave 2) screen-use images to research study staff or 10 out of 14 days of successfully monitored data using the Qustodio software. For Android users, this entailed having at least 21 (wave 1) and 10 (wave 2) days of successfully monitored data using the Chronicle software. Screen time compliance did not include participants who were unable to comply because of Technological issues (refer to the Technological Issues section). Participants were not offered an extension beyond 30 days to reach compliance. \u2022 Accelerometer compliance was defined a priori as at least 21 of 30 days of valid accelerometer data for wave 1 and 10 of 14 days of valid accelerometer data for wave 2. A valid day of accelerometer data was defined as at least 16 hours of wear during a 24-hour period. \u2022 EMA compliance was defined a priori as completing 21 out of 28 surveys for wave 1 and 39 out of 56 surveys for wave 2. We calculated the number of participants who reached strict compliance (wave 1: 21 surveys within a 7-day window and wave 2: 39 surveys within a 14-day window). Participants who were unable to meet strict compliance criteria within the designated window were offered an extension to reach compliance (not exceeding 30 days). The number of additional days needed to reach 21 surveys was also recorded."

We then examined associations between EMA-measured stress and validated measures of stress as well as parental distress and psychological functioning, both of which were constructs hypothesized to be related to stress. Measures were completed once during the baseline survey before the start of the EMA protocol. The measured constructs included overall stress (assessed using the Perceived Stress Scale [36]) as well as caregiver distress (assessed using the Kansas Parental Satisfaction Scale [37] and Confusion, Hubbub, and Order Scale [CHAOS] [38]) and psychological functioning (assessed using the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression [39] and the short-form State-Trait Anxiety Inventory [40])."

Of the 90 caregiver-child dyads invited, 72 (80%) indicated that their child had their own device, 96% (69/72) of which were compatible with Chronicle or Qustodio. Although caregivers from 92% (66/72) of the families agreed to enroll a child device, 88% (63/72) both agreed to enroll and had a compatible device. Ultimately, 86% (54/63) of families were successfully enrolled. Unsuccessful enrollment was\nbecause of the following reasons: technological issues installing the Qustodio app (3/72, 4%), difficulties scheduling a time to enroll the child\u2019s device (3/72, 4%), child device lost (1/72, 1%), caregiver decided not to enroll the child\u2019s device because of lack of use (1/72, 1%), caregiver being unable to access the child\u2019s device (eg, \u201clocked out\u201d; 1/72, 1%). Overall, an average of 16.8 (SD 8.2) days of data per person were captured on child devices using Qustodio and Chronicle."

            "text": "This is the first cohort study to use passive mobile sensing in conjunction with accelerometry and EMA measures with caregiver-child dyads. This preliminary work demonstrates that measures and protocols to collect these multiple streams of data are feasible. The convergent validity between EMA-measured child behavior and caregiver stress shows preliminary validity for using EMA to measure stress and behavior. The generally high levels of compliance and retention of the study sample are encouraging signs that these multiple overlapping methods of intensive longitudinal data can be completed in a longitudinal cohort study. The lack of agreement between self-reported and objectively measured mobile phone use highlights the need for additional objective and low-burden methods of measuring mobile phone use.\nFeasibility outcomes revealed that participants were generally compliant with passive mobile sensing but that technology issues resulted in some data loss. It is notable that this technology is still relatively new, and ideally, as this technology becomes more refined, fewer technological issues will arise. Caregivers were generally willing to allow us to monitor their own device, as evidenced by their enrollment in study procedures and high rates of screen time monitoring compliance. Among families where children had their own device, 92% (66/72) of caregivers were willing to let us monitor their\nJMIR Form Res 2022 | vol. 6 | iss. 9 | e40572 | p. 11https://formative.jmir.org/2022/9/e40572 (page number not for citation purposes)\nXSL\u2022FO RenderX\nchildren\u2019s device. Although we were only able to collect data on a portion of those devices because of the novelty of this technology of our monitoring software, continued advancement and expanding ease of use of monitoring software would likely increase this number, which bodes well for future studies aiming to examine child digital media use.\nInitially, we observed poor accelerometer compliance among children, but this improved following the implementation of a protocol to decorate the accelerometer bands. Notably, the low compliance is likely a function of our strict valid day criteria (ie, 16 hours vs the more commonly used 10 hours) [44] coupled with our relatively high metric of compliance (21 days). Our 21-day compliance is higher than most accelerometer studies, which commonly set compliance at 3 days [44] and use a minimum of 10 hours of wear to determine a valid day. Although not a direct comparison, if we use a criterion of 3 days of valid data (with a 16-hour valid day cutoff), our study shows similar rates of compliance (17% noncompliance) as other studies that use wrist-worn accelerometers (22.7% noncompliance) [45].\nThis study also demonstrated the feasibility of deploying EMA measures for at least 7 days. Not only did participants complete most prompts but nearly all were also compliant per study protocol definitions and were willing to complete additional days of measurement in subsequent waves of data collection (ie, 14 days). It is worth noting that although 100% (105/105) of the sample were considered compliant using criteria specified a priori, some families needed additional days to accumulate the requisite number of completed EMA prompts. Similar to previous EMA studies [46], this flexibility was built into the protocol to retain participants from diverse and low-income backgrounds who might not be able to meet study requirements within the given time span, given time constraints, resources, acute stressors, or complex life situations. Furthermore, the EMA measures of child behavior and stress used in this study showed preliminary evidence of convergent validity with established validated measures.\nOverall, across all study measures, participants reported minimal burden and expressed willingness to continue to participate in future waves. Finally, we were able to recruit and retain a sample to complete measures twice, both instances being an average of 7 months apart, indicating the potential for such methods to be used in cohort studies across development."

            "text": "Other studies have used EMA among racially and ethnically diverse households [46] but not in conjunction with passive mobile sensing and coupled with both caregiver and child accelerometry. The confluence of these data is necessary to understand how and why screen habits develop and ultimately influence children\u2019s sleep, activity, and socioemotional health. Combining objective digital media use data with microtemporal EMA data will allow us to identify systems of \u201cGranger causality,\u201d which are systems where one behavior (eg, digital media use) predicts future behavior (ie, tantrums). Ensuring that these measures and procedures are both feasible and accurate is a necessary first step toward this goal. The links among behaviors likely vary in direction and magnitude among\ndifferent individuals. Characterizing these links can guide advanced intervention methods (eg, just-in-time adaptive interventions and continuous tuning interventions) that aim to maximize change in multiple health behaviors."

            "text": "This study was designed to overcome current measurement limitations regarding mobile phone use. Although our nonrandom sampling approach does represent a threat to external validity (ie, families who volunteer for a study may differ from the general population of families), our successful recruitment and retention of an economically and racially diverse sample speaks to the generalizability of our study findings. In terms of monitoring digital media use, the use of passive sensing represents a significant step forward. However, several key limitations still exist with regard to passive mobile sensing as a method of measuring digital media use. A significant limitation to this work, and to the field at large, is the inability to distinguish who is using a given device (ie, parent, child, or sibling). Although we attempted to ask caregivers when their child was using their smartphone using EMA, these methods were only able to validate to the standard of self-report, which as discussed earlier is inherently flawed. Furthermore, passive mobile sensing is only able to detect whether a screen is on and not whether it is being actively viewed, which in theory could overestimate digital media use. Although some research has attempted to distinguish who is watching a screen based on facial recognition using cameras [47], this work is preliminary and is not currently available for portable digital media. However, although passive mobile sensing is not able to capture all screen use (such as television), this technology represents a significant advancement in the field. Given the recent dramatic increases in children\u2019s use of digital media specifically, and the relatively outdated research on screen time more generally, there is unique value in measuring and investigating digital media use specifically. Research on digital media use specifically (unique from overall screen-use duration) is necessary to understand the unique causes and consequences of this new technology relative to health outcomes. However, low-burden, accurate, and objective measures of digital media use are necessary to advance the science underlying the dynamics and causal factors and outcomes around digital media use.\nAlthough we did not observe any dropouts because of privacy concerns in this study, the issue of data privacy is worth noting. Chronicle was built specifically as a research tool, designed to be Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act\u2013compliant, with participant protections in mind. Among other features, the dashboard requires secure credentials for separate users, and data are deidentified and not linked to any IP addresses or phone numbers [29]. Participants were informed that Chronicle tracks mobile device use in terms of whether the phone is on or off, which apps are running, and what time of the day the apps are used. Chronicle does not collect personal information, phone contacts, content of any SMS text messages or emails, information on what websites are visited, or other specifics such as which videos are watched on YouTube. In contrast, third-party apps such as Qustodio have capacities that may not be useful or desirable to researchers (eg, the ability to log keystrokes and website blocking capability). Researchers\nJMIR Form Res 2022 | vol. 6 | iss. 9 | e40572 | p. 12https://formative.jmir.org/2022/9/e40572 (page number not for citation purposes)\nXSL\u2022FO RenderX\nusing passive mobile sensing apps should be aware of data security (how data are being stored and transmitted) as well as data ownership (to whom do the data belong once they are collected). Although these threats are not unique to research using mobile technologies, there is a need to develop consent processes that actively engage individuals in their own privacy decision-making as much as possible [48,49]."
