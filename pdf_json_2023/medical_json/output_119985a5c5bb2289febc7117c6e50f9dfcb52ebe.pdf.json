    "abstractText": "Composite phase change materials commonly exhibit drawbacks, such as low thermal conductivity, flammability, and potential leakage. This study focuses on the development of a novel flame-retardant phase change material (RPCM). The material\u2019s characteristics and its application in the thermal management of lithium-ion batteries are investigated. Polyethylene glycol (PEG) serves as the medium for phase change; expanded graphite (EG) and multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNT) are incorporated. Moreover, an intumescent flame retardant (IFR) system based on ammonium polyphosphate (APP) is constructed, aided by the inclusion of bio-based flame-retardant chitosan (CS) and barium phytate (PA-Ba), which can improve the flame retardancy of the material. Experimental results demonstrate that the RPCM, containing 15% IFR content, exhibits outstanding flame retardancy, achieving a V-0 flame retardant rating in vertical combustion tests. Moreover, the material exhibits excellent thermomechanical properties and thermal stability. Notably, the material\u2019s thermal conductivity is 558% higher than that of pure PEG. After 2C and 3C high-rate discharge cycles, the highest temperature reached by the battery module cooled with RPCM is 18.71 \u25e6C lower than that of natural air-cooling; the material significantly reduces the temperature difference within the module by 62.7%, which achieves efficient and safe thermal management.",

            "text": "In recent years, the global issues of energy crisis and environmental pollution have emerged due to the escalating demand for fossil fuels [1]. Electric vehicles, one of the new energy sources, can reduce the consumption of fossil fuels to alleviate these problems by replacing conventional fuel vehicles [2\u20134]. Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) are extensively used in electric vehicles and energy storage devices due to their high energy and power densities, long cycle life, and minimal self-discharge rate [5\u20137]. The global market for LIBs has been rapidly growing in response to the increasing demand for electric vehicles. However, it has been observed that during the charging and discharging processes, a substantial amount of heat is generated in the battery modules and packs due to the ohmic heating effect and electrochemical reactions. This heat generation raises the battery temperature and accelerates the degradation of battery performance. With the continuous improvement of LIB energy density and the rapid development of fast charging technology, heat generation is expected to increase further [8]. Therefore, it is crucial to control the operating temperature of LIBs within an optimal range of 20 to 55 \u25e6C [9], with a safe temperature limit of 60 \u25e6C during use [10] and a maximum temperature difference of no more than 5 \u25e6C within the battery module [11]. To achieve this, an effective battery\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4450. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym15224450 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4450 2 of 16\nthermal management system (BTMS) is required to provide high energy density and long battery life. The BTMS plays a vital role in ensuring the performance, safety, and lifespan of LIBs [12], as it effectively regulates the battery temperature and prevents thermal runaway. The current research on battery cooling modes can be categorized based on different cooling mediums, including air cooling [13,14], liquid cooling [15,16], heat pipe cooling [17], phase change materials (PCMs) cooling [18\u201320], and combined cooling strategies [21]. Active cooling systems, such as those employing pumps or fans, consume additional power. In contrast, passive cooling systems like PCM cooling dissipate battery surface temperature without consuming additional energy. PCM cooling technology is extensively employed in the BTMS due to its high energy density and compact nature. In PCM cooling, organic PCMs are the preferred choice. Compared to inorganic PCMs, organic PCMs offer several advantages: high thermal energy storage capacity, low or no subcooling, and no metal corrosion. For example, PEG exhibits a high latent heat of phase transition, a wide range of temperature transitions, excellent thermal and chemical stability, affordability, non-toxicity, and non-corrosiveness [22]. However, organic PCMs have weaknesses, like poor thermal conductivity, susceptibility to leakage, and flammability, significantly restricting their applications. Organic PCMs\u2019 poor thermal conductivity can cause a significant temperature rise due to heat accumulation during the PCM\u2019s heat absorption process, posing a risk of overheating to lithium-ion batteries. By incorporating thermally conductive additives such as expanded graphite (EG) [23,24], carbon fiber [25], metal foam [26,27], metal mesh [19,28], carbon nanotubes (CNTs) [29], and graphene [30] into PCMs, the materials\u2019 thermal conductivity can be increased, facilitating the absorption of heat released by batteries and preventing heat accumulation in the battery module. Among these, EG and CNT are extensively employed. The CPCM was prepared by incorporating different proportions of graphene, CNTs, EG, and paraffin [31]. The addition of carbon additives with different dimensions formed a three-dimensional heat transfer network in the PCM, resulting in a thermal conductivity increase to 5.1 W/m\u00b7K at 25 \u25e6C, exhibiting high thermal conductivity. Leakage tests showed that the weight and morphology of the material remained almost unchanged after heating at 60 \u25e6C for 120 min, indicating high leak-proof properties endowed by the additives. A highly thermally conductive and shape-stable composite material was developed by impregnating single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) into PEG [29]. The influence of different loadings of SWCNTs on the stability and heat transfer performance of PEG was investigated. The experiments demonstrated that SWCNTs exhibited excellent adsorption capacity and leak-proof characteristics, maintaining their shape, and preventing any PEG leakage even after 400 melting and freezing cycles. Compared to pure PEG, an increase in SWCNTs content created more thermal pathways, resulting in a 1329% enhancement in thermal conductivity when the mass fraction of SWCNTs reached 10%. Furthermore, when a battery experiences thermal runaway, the PCM surrounding the battery can easily ignite and exacerbate the propagation of thermal runaway [32]. To mitigate this issue, many experiments have been conducted to enhance the flame retardancy of PCMs by adding flame retardants [33,34]. Halogen-free flame retardants, especially intumescent flame retardants (IFRs), have gained wide usage in many industries due to their high efficiency, low smoke production, and non-toxicity [20]. APP is a commonly used intumescent flame retardant that generates polyphosphoric acid upon thermal decomposition. This acid leads to the formation of a carbonized film on the surface of organic materials, which acts as a barrier against combustion. APP can also produce non-combustible gases such as nitrogen and ammonia, diluting the oxygen supply and reducing the flammability. A flame retardant PCM for battery modules using APP and red phosphorus (RP) was developed [35], and the experimenters conducted a comprehensive investigation on the flame-retardant properties of the materials with varying ratios of flame retardants and found that a ratio of 23/10 exhibited the best flame-retardant properties. In response to the need for sustainable development and the ban on traditional halogenated flame retardants,\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4450 3 of 16\nthere is increasing effort across various industries to develop eco-friendly and sustainable flame-retardant materials. There has been considerable interest in bio-based flame retardants, including Chitosan (CS) [36\u201338], Phytic acid (PA) [39,40], and lignin. These Bio-based flame retardants have been successfully applied for flame retardant modification of various substrates, including polylactic acid (PLA). Nevertheless, their application in phase change materials has been relatively limited. Among them, CS is particularly noteworthy due to its safety, environmental friendliness, and natural abundance. CS is often used in combination with other components, for instance, APP and aluminum hypophosphite, rather than as a standalone flame retardant. The chemical structure of chitosan, which is rich in hydroxyl and amine groups, makes it suitable as a carbonization agent in intumescent flame retardants. An environmentally friendly flame retardant was developed for unsaturated polyester resins; this was achieved by depositing intumescent flame retardant structures of CS and APP onto diatomaceous earth particles using a layer-by-layer assembly method [38]. An inorganic-organic nanohybrid flame retardant was prepared by combining halloysite nanotubes (HNTs), CS, and Fe3O4 [41]. The aim was to improve the thermal stability and enhance the flame retardancy of EP. CS acted as a carbon-forming agent, and the addition of Fe3O4 nanoparticles further promoted the carbonization of chitosan in EP. The combined HNT@chitosan@Fe3O4 system effectively inhibited the decomposition of EP and the release of toxic gases. Furthermore, better flame-retardant effects can be achieved when CS is compounded with phosphorus-containing compounds [42]. PA, with its six phosphate groups and high phosphorus content (up to 28%), can serve as an acid source. Phosphorus compounds facilitate the cross-linking reaction of IFR. The presence of phytates can also trap free radicals, thereby achieving gas-phase flame retardancy. An IFR system was developed, which consisted of PA and CS, with metal ions as synergists [40]. The inclusion of phytate metal salts synergistically enhanced the IFR system and accelerated the formation of non-flammable gases. The flame retardancy of PLA was further enhanced by incorporating nickel phytate (PA-Ni) into PLA containing IFR [39]. The results indicated that PA-Ni can synergistically inhibit the combustion of PLA in combination with IFR, promote the formation of dense char residue, and act as a radical scavenger to eliminate the radicals generated during the combustion process. In conclusion, the incorporation of CS and phytate salts in PCM can effectively enhance the flame retardancy of phase change materials. Traditional flame retardants are derived from unsustainable sources and typically require a minimum additive content of at least 20% in PCM to achieve effective flame retardancy, which leads to a significant reduction in the latent heat capacity of the CPCM [43] and the incorporation of substantial quantities of flame retardants can lead to mechanical property degradation and thermophysical properties experience a decline. [44]. In contrast, bio-based flame retardants, as relatively new alternatives, have demonstrated good flameretardant performance while being more sustainable and environmentally friendly. In this study, CS was used as a carbonizing agent, and PA-Ba was used as a synergistic agent to create an environmentally friendly IFR system based on APP. This system allowed for a reduction in the IFR content in CPCM to 15% by mass while still maintaining excellent flame retardancy. Moreover, the IFR not only enhanced the flame-retardant capability of CPCM but also improved the material\u2019s high-temperature thermal stability. Under battery module charging and discharging operations, the resulting flame-retardant PCM exhibited the same excellent heat-diffusion capability."

The test utilized Cu K\u03b1 radiation (wavelength: 1.5406 nm), with a step size of 0.02\u25e6, a scanning angle ranging from 10\u25e6 to 80\u25e6, and a scanning speed of 7\u25e6/min. This analysis aimed to determine whether any new materials were formed during the physical melt blending process. The Regulus-8100 Field emission scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Hitachi, Tokyo, Japan) was utilized to examine the microstructure and composition distribution of the PCM. A Q20 Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC) from TA Instruments (New Castle, DE, USA) was utilized to study the phase transition properties and latent heat of CPCMs. The sample was heated from the initial equilibrium temperature of 0 \u25e6C to 100 \u25e6C at a rate of 10 \u25e6C/min under a nitrogen atmosphere. Subsequently, it was cooled back to 0 \u25e6C at the same rate of 10 \u25e6C/min after being held at 100 \u25e6C for 5 min. A multifunctional thermal conductivity tester (Dre-III, Xiangtan Xiangyi Instruments Co., Ltd., Xiangtan, China), with a measurement accuracy of \u00b13%, was used to measure the thermal conductivity of the material. The material was compacted into two discshaped samples with a thickness of approximately 8 mm and a diameter of 40 mm for testing. To minimize contact thermal resistance, the surfaces of the cylinders were polished. During the testing, the samples were kept stationary to ensure accurate data and multiple measurements were taken to obtain an average value. To evaluate the leakage resistance of CPCMs, a mass loss test was conducted. During the test, samples were placed in an oven set at 75 \u25e6C. The filter paper was positioned beneath the sample surface to absorb any potential leakage. The samples were weighed every hour, a total of six times, to measure the mass loss of the material and assess its shape stability. The initial mass of the sample was denoted as MO, while the remaining mass after n hours of heating was denoted as Mn. The leakage rate (Ln) after n hours of heating was calculated using the following equation: Ln(wt.%) =(MO\u2212Mn)/MO \u00d7 100%. The thermal stability and thermal degradation of CPCMs were investigated using thermogravimetric experiments conducted on a Q500 thermogravimetric analyzer (TGA) from TA Instruments, Inc., USA. The material was heated from an initial temperature of 30 \u25e6C to 800 \u25e6C at a rate of 20 \u25e6C/min in a nitrogen atmosphere. The flame retardancy of the samples was evaluated using the UL Vertical Flame Test conducted by a CZF-1 Vertical Flame Tester. The size of the samples used in the test was 125 mm \u00d7 13 mm \u00d7 8 mm. During the test; the samples were positioned vertically and exposed to the ignition source twice, with each exposure lasting 10 s. Flame lengths of 20 \u00b1 1 mm were placed in the center of the samples, underneath them. The test results are classified into one of the following categories: V-0, V-1, V-2, or NR (not rated). The V-0 rating indicates the highest level of flame retardancy, while V-1 and V-2 represent lower levels of flame retardancy. The NR classification means that the sample did not receive a flame-retardant rating."

As shown in Figure 10b, the suboptimal flame-retardant effect of RPCM1 was attributed to the inadequate amount of flame retardant, sluggish carbon layer growth, and subpar carbon layer quality. Therefore, after the completion of the second ignition for 60 s, the specimen strip is still burning and cannot pass the vertical combustion test. The reduction in self-extinguishing time observed in the experiment can be directly related to the flame-retardant additives. When 30% IFR is added, the material is extinguished at 1 s.

It can be inferred that when the proportion of IFR is higher, a dense carbon layer can be grown faster to isolate the oxygen and heat to achieve a better flame-retardant effect. However, it is not only better to add more IFR in the material but also to consider the effect on latent heat and the practical effect of applying it to the thermal management of the battery. Compared to other flame retardant PCMs, the novel flame retardant solid\u2013solid PCM [20] employs microencapsulated APP as the flame retardant. The material achieved a V-0 rating in vertical burning tests with a flame-retardant content of 19%. Additionally, as mentioned earlier,\na flame r tardant PCM was prepared to investigate the synergistic flame retardant effect\nof APP and RP [35] and its application in thermal management. The optimal flame-retardant performance was observed when the mass fraction of APP and RP was 33%. In this study, an environmentally friendly IFR system based on APP was used to reduce the IFR content in the phase change material to 15% by mass, achieving a V-0 rating in vertical burning tests.\nFigure 10.

Battery Module Heat Dissipation Performance 3.3.1. Cell\nExperiments were carried out to further investigate the impact of varying flameretardant contents in RPCMs as heat dissipation media for single-cell thermal management and to validate the temperature control performance of the materials. The experiments were carried out in a constant temperature incubator at 25 \u25e6C, and the thermal management effects of the five RPCMs and the naturally cooled Group Blank without CPCM were tested, respectively. Figure 11 shows the variation of cell surface temperature with time at two\nPolymers 2023, 15, 4450 12 of 16\ndischarge rates, 2C and 3C. In Figure 11a, at 2C, the battery temperature rises sharply during the constant-current discharge phase, and the maximum temperature of group Blank reaches 53.67 \u25e6C. The maximum temperatures of the RPCM-cooled batteries are 44.56 \u25e6C, 45.80 \u25e6C, 47.1 \u25e6C, 45.71 \u25e6C, and 49.98 \u25e6C in the order of the maximum temperature of the RPCM-cooled batteries. The material RPCM1 has the best cooling effect, with the surface temperature of the battery reduced by 9.11 \u25e6C. The main reason is that RPCM1 has high latent heat and thermal conductivity, enabling it to rapidly absorb and transfer heat. In contrast, when air is used as the medium, its low thermal conductivity leads to inefficient heat dissipation. As a result, heat accumulates in the system, causing a rapid increase in temperature. As shown in Figure 11b, the maximum surface temperature of the battery in group Blank reaches 68.15 \u25e6C at 3C discharge, while the surface temperature of the battery under RPCM is 58.4~61.69 \u25e6C, which is 6.46~9.75 \u25e6C lower than that of the LIB in the blank group Blank. The highest temperature recorded for the battery with RPCM cooling is 44.56 \u25e6C, 45.80 \u25e6C, 47.1 \u25e6C, 45.71 \u25e6C, and 49.98 \u25e6C, respectively. Compared with natural cooling, the use of RPCM noticeably reduces the surface temperature of the battery module. RPCM can absorb heat generated by cells during thermal management, effectively controlling the temperature within a safe operating range of 60 \u25e6C [10]. It serves as a temperature buffer.\nPolymers 2023, 15, x FOR PEER REVIEW 13 of 18 Table 4. Vertical combustion rating for each sample.

The temperature reduction effect was remarkable. The results demonstrate that the RPCM can buffer rapid temperature changes, absorb heat during battery temperature increases, release heat during temperature decreases, and exhibit good temperature control performance.

Conclusions In this study, a novel RPCM was prepared using PEG and bio-based flame retardant. The main conclusions are as follows: (1) After the addition of MWCNTs and EG, the material exhibits a significant increase\nof 558% in thermal conductivity compared to pure PEG. The addition of CS/APP/PA-Ba flame retardants significantly increased the residual carbon content and flame retardancy of the material while reducing organic leakage, effectively enhancing the thermal stability of PCM. (2) When the flame-retardant content was 15%, the material RPCM2 achieved a V-0 flame retardant rating, with a thermal conductivity of 2.04 W/m\u00b7K and a latent heat value of 151.58 W/g. Therefore, RPCM2 not only maintains excellent thermodynamic performance but also exhibits outstanding flame retardancy and good thermal stability. (3) Compared to natural cooling, the use of the novel RPCM as a heat dissipation medium in thermal management demonstrated a significant cooling effect. In a 3C cycle, the battery module experienced a reduction of 18.71 \u00b0C in its maximum temperature, and the temperature difference decreased by 62.7% compared to natural cooling.
