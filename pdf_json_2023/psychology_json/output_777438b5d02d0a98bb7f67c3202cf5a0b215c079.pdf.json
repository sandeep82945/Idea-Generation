R. China, Zhengzhou, Henan, China, 3Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences, Henan University of Chinese Medicine, Zhengzhou, Henan, China, 4The First Affiliated Hospital, Henan University of Chinese Medicine, Zhengzhou, Henan, China\nIntroduction: Acute lung injury (ALI) is a common and devastating respiratory disease associated with uncontrolled inflammatory response and transepithelial neutrophil migration. In recent years, a growing number of studies have found that Ardisiae Japonicae Herba (AJH) has a favorable anti-inflammatory effect. However, its serum material basis and molecular mechanism are still unknown in ALI treatment. In this study, metabolomics and network analysis of serum pharmacochemistry were used to explore the therapeutic effect and molecular mechanism of AJH against lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI.\nMethods: A total of 12 rats for serum pharmacochemistry analysis were randomly divided into the LPS group and LPS + AJH-treated group (treated with AJH extract 20 g/kg/d), whichwere administered LPS (2 mg/kg) by intratracheal instillation and then continuously administered for 7 days. Moreover, 36 rats for metabolomic research were divided into control, LPS, LPS + AJH-treated (5, 10, and 20 g/kg/d), and LPS + dexamethasone (Dex) (2.3 \u00d7 10\u22124 g/kg/d) groups. After 1 h of the seventh administration, the LPS, LPS + AJH-treated, and LPS + Dex groups were administered LPS by intratracheal instillation to induce ALI. The serum pharmacochemistry profiling was performed by UPLC-Orbitrap Fusion MS to identify serum components, which further explore the molecular mechanism of AJH against ALI by network analysis. Meanwhile, metabolomics was used to select the potential biomarkers and relatedmetabolic pathways and to analyze the therapeutic mechanism of AJH against ALI.\nResults: The results showed that 71 serumcomponents and 18 relatedmetabolites were identified in ALI rat serum. We found that 81 overlapping targets were frequently involved in AGE-RAGE, PI3K-AKT, and JAK-STAT signaling pathways in network analysis. The LPS + AJH-treated groups exerted protective effects against ALI by reducing the infiltration of inflammatory cells and achieved antiinflammatory efficacy by significantly regulating the interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10 levels. Metabolomics analysis shows that the therapeutic effect of AJH on ALI"

            "text": "Acute lung injury (ALI), a common and devastating respiratory disease, is induced by inhalation injury, acute pneumonia, trauma, sepsis, pulmonary edema, and acute pancreatitis (Savino et al., 2019; Bin et al., 2022; Ying et al., 2022). ALI is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in intensive care units (SeungHye and Mallampalli, 2015; Huang et al., 2018), and the mortality rate is 35%\u201355% (Levitt et al., 2013). The pathological characteristics are associated with excessive immune cell activation, oxidative stress, inflammation, hypoxemia, bilateral lung infiltration, and electrolyte disturbances (Jiang et al., 2020; liu et al., 2021; Ying et al., 2022). ALI is considered an acute lung disease and has severe inflammatory response outbreaks in the lung accompanied by widespread damage to epithelial and endothelial cells, macrophage activation, and neutrophil infiltration (Wu et al., 2022; Zhang et al., 2022). Zhang et al. (2019) demonstrated that dexmedetomidine can inhibit the inflammatory response by regulating GSK-3\u03b2/STAT3NF-\u03baB. In addition, several studies demonstrated that some Chinese medicines (CMs) improve ALI by regulating relevant inflammatory cytokines and pathways. Scutellariae Radix can improve ALI by reducing the expression of nitric oxide (NO), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin (IL)-6, and IL-8 (Hu et al., 2020). In addition, Sarcandra glabra combined with lycopene ameliorates histopathological injuries and decreases the levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and transcription factor NF-kB were activated in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced ALI rats, which exhibit a significant effect in protecting and improving LPS-induced ALI rats (Liu and Chen, 2016). Therefore, deregulating inflammatory response may play a significant role and be available for ALI treatment. Ardisiae Japonicae Herba (AJH, Ardisia japonica (Thunb.) Blume), having a slightly bitter taste, belongs to the genus Ardisia and family Primulaceae. AJH converges the lung and liver meridians and has detoxification effects and activates blood circulation, which is recorded in the Materia Medica based on Chinese medical theory. On the basis of its anti-inflammatory (Liu et al., 2009), anti-cancer (Chang et al., 2007; Li et al., 2012), and anti-viral effects (Tien et al., 2007), AJH is widely used to improve chronic bronchitis (Xi, 2006) and hepatoma carcinoma (Gong et al., 2021). Cao et al. (2021) demonstrated that flavonoids in AJH showed an anti-inflammatory effect by regulating the levels of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2, which could inhibit the proliferation and activation of hepatic stellate cells, and affect the immune function. In our previous study, we found that three components in AJH, namely, bergenin, luteolin, and kaempferol, decreased the IL-6 and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) 9 levels, which showed a significant anti-inflammatory effect in a TNF-\u03b1-induced A549 cell model (Feng et al., 2022). Therefore, it can be deduced that AJH was effective against ALI through the anti-inflammatory mechanism. In order to confirm this hypothesis, we investigated the therapeutic effect and molecular mechanism of AJH on LPS-induced ALI rats by network analysis and metabolomics. Due to the complexity of serum components of CMs, network analysis is often applied to study the pharmacological action and molecular mechanism of components or serum components by computer algorithms and network databases, including Metascape, GeneCards, and STRING (Societies, 2021; Han et al., 2022; Xiong et al., 2022). Moreover, metabolomics can comprehensively identify and quantify endogenous metabolites to systematically investigate the metabolic response and pathway by multivariate statistical analysis, which has been widely used in disease diagnosis and toxicology (Liu and Chen, 2016).\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org03\nHan et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.1131479\nTherefore, we integrate network analysis and metabolomics to investigate the material basis and the anti-inflammatory molecular mechanism of AJH against ALI. First, the serum components of AJH in the ALI model rat were identified by UPLC-Orbitrap Fusion MS. Subsequently, we further systematically hypothesized and incorporated the potential therapeutic targets and molecular mechanism based on the network analysis. Finally, the therapeutic mechanisms of AJH\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org04\nHan et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.1131479\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org05\nHan et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.1131479\nFro n tie rs in P h arm ac o lo g y\nfro n tie rsin .o rg\n0 6\nH an e t al.\n10 .3 3 8 9 /fp h ar.2 0 2 3 .113 14 79\nFro n tie rs in P h arm ac o lo g y\nfro n tie rsin .o rg\n0 7\nH an e t al.\n10 .3 3 8 9 /fp h ar.2 0 2 3 .113 14 79\nFro n tie rs in P h arm ac o lo g y\nfro n tie rsin .o rg\n0 8\nH an e t al.\n10 .3 3 8 9 /fp h ar.2 0 2 3 .113 14 79\nFro n tie rs in P h arm ac o lo g y\nfro n tie rsin .o rg\n0 9\nH an e t al.\n10 .3 3 8 9 /fp h ar.2 0 2 3 .113 14 79\nagainst ALI were evaluated by biochemical indexes and histopathology of the lung.

Furthermore, the LPS doses were selected as previously described (Hu et al., 2020). Subsequently, 24 h after modeling, 36 rats for metabolomic research were tested for lung function and then euthanized after anesthesia to harvest bio-samples including serum, lung tissues, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF).

PCA can reduce the dimensionality of complex datasets to form several main components, reflect the natural distribution of different groups, and find outliers (Huang et al., 2018). The data of 102 metabolites in each group were performed using SIMCA 14.1 software to establish the PCA score plot (Figure 6B). The control, LPS, LPS + Dex, and LPS + AJH-treated groups were significantly scattered and clustered. In addition, the control group was significantly separated from the LPS group, which further proved that the ALI rat model was successfully replicated, as shown in Figure 6B. Compared with the control group and LPS group, the LPS + Dex and LPS + AJH-treated groups are close to the control group and away from the LPS group. The aforementioned PCA results illustrated the effectiveness of AJH in the intervention of ALI.\nIn order to further select potential biomarkers and determine the difference between the control group and LPS group, between control, LPS groups, and LPS + AJH-treated groups, and between control, LPS groups, and LPS + Dex group, the metabolomics data were placed in a supervised method of PLS-DA (Figure 6C).

            "text": "ALI is caused by the excessive release of the inflammatory cytokines to break the balance of inflammatory and antiinflammatory cytokines, which can further develop into the systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and eventually to multiple organ failure (MOF) (Liu and Chen, 2016). Therefore, inflammation is of great significance in ALI, especially chronic obstructive\npulmonary disease and acute exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Inflammation causes the infiltration of inflammatory cells and can release the chemokines and proinflammatory cytokines (Han et al., 2022; Yuan et al., 2022). The related study has demonstrated that TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, and IL-18 are most closely associated with the outcome of ALI and are the current diagnosis and prognosis method (Parsons et al., 2005). Lv et al. (2021) indicated that fluorofenidone has a therapeutic effect on ALI by alleviating the lung tissue structure and decreasing the levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 in the BALF. In our study, the level of IL-6 and IL-10 in serum and BALF were significantly upregulated or downregulated in ALI model rats compared with the control group, which might imply that AJH had anti-inflammatory capability. In addition, the lung wet/dry (W/D) ratio and indexes of the thymus and spleen in the LPS group were markedly elevated. The aforementioned indexes were also improved in the AJH-treated groups at different levels. Therefore, our study proved that AJH improved lung function and decreased systemic inflammation and provided evidence of an anti-inflammatory role of AJH at multiple levels. In our histopathological study, marked inflammatory cell infiltration, alveolar ectasia and fusion, and bronchiolar stenosis were improved in the AJH-treated groups at different levels.\nIn our previous study, we identified 236 components in AJH. Network analysis indicated that 41 core components could regulate the inflammation-related pathways, and the core components have anti-inflammatory effects (Feng et al., 2022). According to Bencao Shiyi, AJH is effective in reducing swelling, resolving phlegm, and relieving cough, which is widely used for treating cough, wheezing,\nTABLE 4 Details about 14 metabolic pathways.\nNo. Pathway name Match status\nP -log(p) Holmp Impact Biomarkers\na Linoleic acid metabolism 1/5 0.044409 1.3525 1 1 Linoleate\nb Phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis\n2/4 0.0004501 3.3467 0.03736 1 L-Phenylalanine and L-tyrosine\nc Phenylalanine metabolism 3/10 0.0000679 4.168 0.00571 0.35714 L-Tyrosine, hippurate, and L-phenylalanine\nd Tyrosine metabolism 1/42 0.32039 0.49432 1 0.13972 L-Tyrosine\ne Tryptophan metabolism 2/41 0.050822 1.2939 1 0.05291 N-Acetylserotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetate\nf Steroid hormone biosynthesis 1/85 0.54752 0.2616 1 0.02562 Corticosterone\ng Valine, leucine, and isoleucine degradation\n2/40 0.048593 1.3134 1 0.02264 L-Valine and methylmalonate\nh Arginine and proline metabolism 2/38 0.044248 1.3541 1 0.01212 Creatine and 4-acetamidobutanoate\ni Pantothenate and CoA biosynthesis 2/19 0.011871 1.9255 0.94967 0.00714 Pantothenate and L-valine\nj Aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis 3/48 0.0079837 2.0978 0.64668 0 L-Phenylalanine, L-valine, and L-tyrosine\nk Valine, leucine, and isoleucine biosynthesis\n1/8 0.070168 1.1539 1 0 L-Valine\nl Ubiquinone and other terpenoid\u2013quinone biosynthesis\n1/9 0.07861 1.1045 1 0 L-Tyrosine\nm Glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism\n1/33 0.26108 0.58322 1 0 Creatine\nn Biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids 3/36 0.0035154 2.454 0.28826 0 Octadecanoic acid, linoleate, and (5Z,8Z,11Z,14Z,17Z)-icosapentaenoic acid\nFrontiers in Pharmacology frontiersin.org21\nHan et al. 10.3389/fphar.2023.1131479\nblood in sputum, chronic bronchitis, and damp heat jaundice. Zhou et al. (2012) investigated and found that AJH is effective in preventing respiratory diseases, which can relieve symptoms and improve the pulmonary function in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Recently, network analysis illustrates the complex interactions among the biological systems, drugs, and disease from a network perspective, which opens avenues for new research ideas and technical means to study the action mechanisms of the CM formulae (Li, 2021). In our study, we further identified the serum components in ALI rats and used integrated network analysis and metabolomics to study the therapeutic effects of AJH in the ALI treatment. We identified a total of 71 serum components and 18 related metabolites in the ALI rat model, mainly including flavonoids, phenylpropanoids, and terpenes.\nBecause serum components in AJH might act on the diverse potential targets, we collected targets of serum components and targets associated with ALI to further explore the mechanisms underlying AJH against ALI by network analysis. According to degree values in the AJH\u2013component\u2013target\u2013ALI network, we selected the five core serum components, including hydroxygenkwanin, luteolin, apigenin, kaempferol, and quercetin. The aforementioned core serum components of AJH belonged to flavonoids. Flavonoids are ubiquitous in all vascular plants and have been recognized to possess anti-inflammatory, anti-atherogenic, anti-allergic, and anti-cancer activities in vitro and in vivo (Ana et al., 2008; Chagas et al., 2022). Jiang et al. (2014) indicated that hydroxygenkwanin, luteolin, and apigenin possess immunoregulatory functions in LPS-activated RAW264.7 cells by suppressing the production of NO, which shows significant antiinflammatory and antioxidant activities. In our previous study, luteolin, kaempferol, and quercetin showed an anti-inflammatory effect by regulating the IL-6 andMMP9 levels in the TNF-\u03b1-induced A549 cell model (Han et al., 2021; Feng et al., 2022). In addition, the PPI network was constructed to select the key targets among 81 overlapping targets, including TNF, TP53, ALB, IL-6, AKT1, VEGFA, EGFR, MAPK, and TLR4. The related studies revealed that IL-6, VEGFA, EGFR, and MAPK are linked to inflammatory pathogenesis of ALI (Chu et al., 2016; Ying et al., 2022). These key targets might be regulated to achieve anti-inflammatory activity of AJH against ALI. According to GO and KEGG analysis, some targets among the 81 overlapping targets are highly enriched inflammatory-related pathways, including the PI3K-Akt, AGERAGE, and JAK-STAT signaling pathways. Yu et al. (2022) suggested that the AGE-RAGE signaling pathway is activated to further increase the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, including IL-1\u03b2 and TNF. The relevant studies illustrated that the PI3K-AKT could regulate downstream inflammatory cytokines, which plays a crucial role in inflammatory response (Schaper and Rose-John, 2015; Nazanin et al., 2020). Therefore, the serum components of AJH might act on 81 overlapping targets to regulate inflammatoryrelated pathways.\nThe metabolomics analysis revealed some potential biomarkers related with the therapeutic effects of AJH for LPS-induced ALI. Upregulation of L-Phenylalanine and downregulation of L-tyrosine in the ALI rat model were the intermediates of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis. Capuron et al. (2011) illustrated that increased inflammation is linked to reduced\ntryptophan levels to improve tryptophan catabolism, and the inflammation was associated with increasing phenylalanine levels at the expense of tyrosine. We found that L-phenylalanine and L-tyrosine concentrations were called back in the LPS + AJH-treated groups, indicating the therapeutic effects of AJH on LPS-induced ALI rats. In addition, due to mitochondria being vulnerable to oxidation stress and pro-inflammatory mediators (Liu and Chen, 2016). Ji (2020), a LPS-induced macrophage inflammatory environment reduces the core enzyme levels of mitochondria and affects mitochondrial function that is closely related to the stability of the citrate cycle. In our study, the creatine levels associated with the citrate cycle were significantly downregulated in the LPS + AJHtreated groups, which revealed that AJH could protect LPS-induced ALI rats by restoring the disordered metabolism. Furthermore, the relative study suggested that fatty acids and derivatives play essential roles in various physiological processes, which have endogenous anti-inflammatory, antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, and immunomodulatory agents (Das, 2018) and were considered clinical diagnosis indexes associated with inflammation (Does et al., 2018). Linoleic acid, as typical essential fatty acids, is a precursor and generates dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid and arachidonic acid (Evans et al., 2014). According to our results, the levels of linoleic acid in ALI rats were increased, but its concentration was called back in the LPS + AJH-treated groups. The previous study showed that arachidonic acid, as an important precursor of inflammatory mediators (eicosanoids), can regulate inflammatory and immune responses (Chandrasekharan et al., 2016). Meanwhile, arachidonic acid was related to inflammatory pathways including TLR4 and MAPK (Mateu et al., 2016), which could be evidenced from our network analysis results. Moreover, the level of arachidonic acid among 102 metabolites was decreased in ALI rats in our study, which may be converted into proinflammatory products and is consistent with the previous results (Wang et al., 2020).\nTherefore, AJH modulation on potential biomarker metabolism might be related to the regulation of inflammatory-related pathways selected by network analysis of serum components. In addition, we further hypothesized that AJH exerts anti-inflammatory activity in the LPS-induced ALI model by regulating potential biomarkers, including L-phenylalanine, L-tyrosine, and linoleic acid levels in phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis and linoleic acid metabolism. Thus, the regulation of AJH on phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis and linoleic acid metabolism may be associated with its alleviatory effects on inflammation responses in vivo to improve LPS-induced ALI. Our study initially elucidated serum material basis and effective mechanism of AJH in the ALI treatment by network analysis and untargeted metabolomics. For a better understanding of the molecular mechanism of potential biomarkers and related metabolism pathways, targeted metabolomics, proteomics, and genomics need to be studied further."

Meanwhile, metabolomics results showed that AJH was effective in treating ALI by alleviating infiltration of inflammatory cells in alveolar spaces and regulating the expression of inflammatory cytokines. AJH might link to reverse the abnormality of phenylalanine, tyrosine, and tryptophan biosynthesis and linoleic acid metabolism pathways to regulate the concentrations of potential biomarkers to normal levels. Therefore, AJH could alleviate inflammation responses in the ALI treatment."
