    "abstractText": "We present a (nongyrotropic) metasurface magnetless specular isolator. This device reflects as a mirror a wave incident under a specified angle in one direction and absorbs it in the opposite direction. The metasurface is synthesized in terms of bianisotropic susceptibility tensors, whose nonreciprocity resides in normal components and exhibits a hybrid electric, magneto-electric nature. The metaparticle is implemented in the form of a U-shaped conducting structure loaded by a transistor. The operation principle of the specular isolator is demonstrated by both full-wave simulation and experiment, with isolation levels reaching 41 and 38 dB respectively. This system represents the first realization of a metasurface involving nonreciprocal normal susceptibilities and features a previously unreported type of nonreciprocity.",

            "text": "isolator Guillaume Lavigne1*, Toshiro Kodera2 & Christophe Caloz3\nWe present a (nongyrotropic) metasurface magnetless specular isolator. This device reflects as a mirror a wave incident under a specified angle in one direction and absorbs it in the opposite direction. The metasurface is synthesized in terms of bianisotropic susceptibility tensors, whose nonreciprocity resides in normal components and exhibits a hybrid electric, magneto-electric nature. The metaparticle is implemented in the form of a U-shaped conducting structure loaded by a transistor. The operation principle of the specular isolator is demonstrated by both full-wave simulation and experiment, with isolation levels reaching 41 and 38 dB respectively. This system represents the first realization of a metasurface involving nonreciprocal normal susceptibilities and features a previously unreported type of nonreciprocity.\nMagnetless nonreciprocity has recently arisen as a solution for breaking Lorentz reciprocity without the drawbacks of the dominant magnetized ferrite or terbium gallium garnet\u00a0(TGGs) technologies1\u20133, namely incompatibility with integrated circuits, large size, heavy weigth and high cost. Magnetless nonreciprocity can be achieved in linear or nonlinear forms. The latter, being restricted to fixed intensity ranges and non-simultaneous excitations in opposite directions4,5, does not represent a viable solution for practical devices6. In contrast, linear nonreciprocity may be highly efficient, while bearing potential for novel types of nonreciprocities. In the microwave and millimeter-wave regimes, it subdivides into space-time modulated systems\u00a0(dynamic bias)7\u201314 and transistorloaded systems\u00a0(static bias)15\u201328. The transistor approach is particularly suitable for typical, monochromatic nonreciprocal operations (isolation, circulation and nonreciprocal phase-shifting), given their simple, low consumption and inexpensive (DC)\u00a0biasing scheme, and immunity to spurious harmonics and intermodulation products.\nMetasurfaces, which have already led to myriad of novel electromagnetic applications29,30, represent an unprecedented opportunity for magnetless nonreciprocity. This opportunity largely stems from the great diversity associated with bianisotropic metasurface designs, which provides superior control over the fundamental properties of electromagnetic waves31\u201336, and from the recent development of corresponding powerful synthesis techniques37\u201339. A number of magnetless nonreciprocal metasurface have been recently reported in transistorloaded technology, including metasurfaces realizing nonreciprocal polarization rotation in reflection18,19,26 and in transmission22,28, reflective spatial circulation25, transmissive isolation23 and nonreciprocal reflective beamsteering27. However, these metasurfaces are either purely theoretical22,25,26, or limited in terms of functionality18,19 or yet relying on antenna-array technology23,27,28.\nThis paper reports a transistor-loaded magnetless nonreciprocal metasurface providing specular isolation, i.e. reflecting the wave incident from one direction as a mirror and absorbing the wave incident from the opposite direction. The related asymmetric reflection coefficient is realized by leveraging nonreciprocal normal metasurface susceptibilities40,41. The metasurface is synthesized using Generalized Sheet Transition Conditions (GSTCs) and a corresponding transistor-loaded metaparticle is proposed. The specular isolation operation is demonstrated by both full-wave simulation and prototype measurement."

First, the specular nature of the reflection ( \u03b8r = \u03b8i ) requires that the metasurface has no phase gradient, which implies that it must be uniform. Second, the fact that there is only one scattered wave, and hence no diffraction orders, implies, assuming a periodic metasurface structure of period d, that d < | /(sin \u03b8i \u00b1 1)| . Third, the spatial asymmetry of the reflection implies breaking Lorentz reciprocity, which means that the metasurface must be nonreciprocal.\nOPEN\n1Department of Electrical Engineering, Polytechnique Montreal, Montreal, QC, Canada. 2Meisei University, Tokyo, Japan. 3Faculty of Engineering Science, Katholieke Universiteit (KU) Leuven, Leuven, Belgium. *email: guillaume.lavigne@polymtl.ca\n2 Vol:.(1234567890) Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:5652 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-09576-0\nIn addition, we assume that the metasurface is nongyrotropic, i.e., that it does not rotate the polarization of the incident wave upon reflection.

Given its deeply subwavelength thickness, a metasurface can be conveniently modeled by the so-called Generalized Sheet Transition Conditions (GSTCs)42,43. The GSTCs are a generalization of the conventional boundary conditions via the addition of surface polarization currents. These conditions were originally derived by Idemen42, next applied to metasurfaces by Kuester\u00a0 et al.43, and finally incorporated in a general metasurface synthesis technique devolopped by Achouri\u00a0et al.39.

Thus, breaking reciprocity in reflection can be accomplished only via normal susceptibilities (under the prevailing nongyrotropy assumption26). It can be shown that the second relation in\u00a0(6), involving tangential susceptibilities, breaks reciprocity in the z-direction40, which would be useful for transmission-type nonreciprocity.\nMetasurface design. Susceptibility derivation. The specular isolator metasurface may be designed in the following three steps: (i)\u00a0 define the fields related to the desired wave transformations; (ii)\u00a0 insert these fields into\u00a0(3) to determine the appropriate field differences and averages; (iii)\u00a0insert these last quantities into\u00a0(8), and solve the resulting equations for the susceptibility components. According to the analysis performed in\u00a0\u201cRequired susceptibility components\u201d section, the susceptibility components obtained by this procedure should automatically respect the condition\u00a0(12).\nThe field definitions in (i) correspond here to the two field transformations represented in\u00a0Fig.\u00a01. The first field transformation is the specular reflection of the wave incident in the +z-direction at the operation angle \u03b80 (Fig.\u00a01a). The related fields are\nwhere \u03c6 is the reflection phase induced by the metasurface. The second transformation is the absorption of the wave incident at the angle \u2212\u03b80 (Fig.\u00a01b). The related fields are\nSuccessively substituting both\u00a0(13) and\u00a0(14) into\u00a0(3), according to (ii), and inserting the resulting expressions into\u00a0(8), according to (iii), leads a system of 2\u00d7 2 = 4 scalar equations with 9 unknowns. This is an underdetermined system with an infinite number of possible sets of susceptibilities. Since the operation of the metasurface has been completely determined at \u03b80 , these sets correspond to different responses at other (unspecified) angles of incidence, and represent therefore degrees of freedom, which may be generally leveraged in the design of the metaparticle. Among these degrees of freedom, the parameters \u03c7xyem and \u03c7 yx me correspond to structural asymmetry along the z-direction40,44, which would imply considerable complexity in the metaparticle design. Therefore, we heuristically set these parameters to zero ( \u03c7xyem = \u03c7 yx me = 0 ). This reduces the number of unknowns to 7, which we shall maintain as degrees of freedom at this point. The resulting system of equations leads to the 2 explicit susceptibility solutions\nand to the 2 constraint relations\nbetween the remaining 5 susceptibilities.\nTransistor\u2011loaded metaparticle. The metaparticle structure satisfying the condition\u00a0(12) (nonreciprocity along the x-direction for p-polarization) and the relations\u00a0(15) (reflection and absorption at \u00b1\u03b80 ) may be devised as follows. Let us start by enforcing the first nonreciprocity condition in\u00a0(12), namely \u03c7xzee = \u03c7 zxee . This condition implies the existence of nonreciprocally related electric dipole responses along x and z, which immediately suggests an L-shape conducting structure loaded by a transistor, operating as a unilateral element (e.g., commonsource configuration in the case of a FET), in the xz-plane; this configuration is incidentally consistent with\u00a0(15a) and\u00a0(15b). Such a structure implies in particular a \u03c7 zzee response, which generally implies in turn a \u03c7 yy mm response according to\u00a0(15c). The latter corresponds to a y-directed magnetic dipole moment, which prompts us to close the L-shape into a loop in the xz-plane. We shall leave the loop open, as is customarily done for compactness in ring resonators, and we shall terminate the opened ends of the resulting U-shaped loop by T-shaped strips to reduce the size of the metaparticle. All these considerations lead to the metaparticle structure represented in\n(12)\u03c7xzee = \u03c7 zx ee or \u03c7 zy em = \u2212\u03c7 yz me,\n(13a)E1,i = cos \u03b80e\u2212jkxx x\u0302 \u2212 sin \u03b80e\u2212jkxx z\u0302, H1,i = (e\u2212jkxx/\u03b7)y\u0302,\n(13b)E1,r = \u2212 cos \u03b80ej\u03c6e\u2212jkxx x\u0302 \u2212 sin \u03b80ej\u03c6e\u2212jkxx z\u0302, H1,r = (ej\u03c6e\u2212jkxx/\u03b7)y\u0302,\n(14a)E2,i = cos \u03b80e\u2212jkxx x\u0302 + sin \u03b80e\u2212jkxx z\u0302, H2,i = (e\u2212jkxx/\u03b7)y\u0302,\n(14b)E2,r = 0, H2,r = 0.\n(15a)\u03c7xxee = \u22122j(1+ ej\u03c6) sec \u03b80\nk ,\n(15b)\u03c7xzee = 2jej\u03c6 csc \u03b80\nk ,\n(15c)\u03c7yymm = \u2212 2j cos \u03b80 + k\u03c7\nzz ee sin 2 \u03b80 + e j\u03c6k sin \u03b80(\u03c7 zx ee cos \u03b80 + \u03c7 zz ee sin \u03b80)\n(1+ ej\u03c6)k ,\n(15d)\u03c7 zyem = \u2212 k\u03c7\nyz me + k\u03c7 zx ee cos \u03b80 + e j\u03c6(k\u03c7 yz me + 2j cot \u03b80)\n(1+ ej\u03c6)k ,\n5 Vol.:(0123456789) Scientific Reports | (2022) 12:5652 | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-09576-0\nFig.\u00a02, which is composed of conducting strips in the three directions of space, with the spacing between the two xy-plane metallization planes being much smaller than the wavelength ( v \u226a l < , figure not to scale). We shall next analyze this metaparticle in details to verify that it indeed satisfies all the required conditions and to fully characterize it. Figure\u00a02 decomposes the excitations (incident fields) and responses (dipole moments) in order to determine how the metaparticle realizes the sought after nonreciprocal susceptibility components, although all of the excitations and responses naturally occur simultaneously. Using this approach, we shall next examine the polarizability responses of the isolated metaparticle, which are directly related to the susceptibilities of the metasurface formed by its periodic repetition39.\nFigure\u00a02a depicts the operation principle of the metaparticle realizing a response of the type \u03c7xzee = \u03c7 zxee . On the left, the x-directed incident electric field induces in-phase ( v \u226a ) currents in the two x-directed strips. When they reach the z-directed strip, these currents cancel out, which implies that the electric response along z to the electric excitation along x is zero ( pzxee = 0 \u2192 \u03c7 zxee = 0 ). On the right, the z-directed incident electric field induces a current in the z-directed strip. This induces a current only in one of the x-directed strips, given the orientation of the transistor, which implies that the electric response along x to the electric field along z is nonzero ( pxzee = 0 \u2192 \u03c7xzee = 0 ). Thus, the metaparticle corresponds to a specific set of solutions of\u00a0(15c) and\u00a0(15d) that is characterized by \u03c7 zxee = 0 , which simplifies these constraint equations to\nx\ny\n(a)\n(b)\nz\npzxee \u2192 \u03c7zxee p xz ee \u2192 \u03c7xzee\npzyem \u2192 \u03c7zyem pyzme \u2192 \u03c7yzme\nEx\nEx\nEz\nEz\nEz\nHy kk\nkk\nk\nH\nE\nl\nv\nFigure\u00a02.

Let us see whether this is indeed the case with the help of\u00a0Fig.\u00a02b. On the left, the y-directed incident magnetic field induces a current in the metaparticle loop. The current flowing in the z-directed strip implies an electric response along z due to the magnetic excitation along y ( pzyem \u2192 \u03c7 zy em ). On the right, the z-directed incident electric field induces a current in z-directed strip. This can induce a current only in one of the two x-directed strips given the to the orientation of the transistor, which produces only a weak magnetic loop along y ( pyzme \u2192 \u03c7 yz me ). This implies that \u03c7 zyem = \u2212\u03c7 yz me , which is consistent with the requirement of\u00a0(16b).\nWe have thus found that the metasurface constituted of the heuristic metaparticle shown in\u00a0Fig.\u00a02 breaks reciprocity in two distinct fashions, through \u03c7 zxee = \u03c7xzee and \u03c7 yz me = \u03c7 zy em . These two types of nonreciprocity represent, both in isolation and in combination, novel metasurface nonreciprocal responses. Moreover, these responses, involving normal susceptibility components, were deemed particularly difficult to realize in practice40. The asymmetry of the electric susceptibility tensor, \u03c7 ee = \u03c7 T ee , also appears in magnetized plasmas, but conjunctly with gyrotropy, while the non-antisymmetry between the magneto-electric susceptibility tensors, \u03c7 em = \u2212\u03c7 T me , also appears in the transmissive nonreciprocal metasurface in23, but in terms of tangential nonreciprocal components. Figure\u00a03 shows the metasurface unit cell of our experimental prototype. This unit cell corresponds to the\nmetaparticle in\u00a0Fig.\u00a02, except for the additional supporting substrate, backing ground plane and conducting front frame (connected to the ground plane). The ground plane ensures impenetrability of the structure for all angles of incidence (extra specification) and the front frame both isolates the unit cells from each other (hence ensuring direct correspondence between the polarizabilities and the susceptibilities) and provides DC return to the ground for the transistor. The parameters of the unit cell were optimized to satisfy\u00a0(15a) and\u00a0(15b) and one of the possible solutions of\u00a0(16).\nSimulation and experiment. The transistor-loaded unit cell in\u00a0Fig.\u00a03 was simulated with periodic boundary conditions using a full-wave electromagnetic simulator (CST Microwave Studio) and the unilateral transistor circuit was modelled as an ideal isolator with a phase shifter. An FR4 slab with \u01ebr = 4.5 was used as the substrate and the geometrical parameters of the metasurface were optimized to realize the specular isolation operation. The metasurface was designed to provide specular isolation between the angles \u00b118\u25e6 at the frequency of f sim0 = 6.56\u00a0GHz for p-polarization. Figure\u00a04 presents the simulation results. Figure\u00a04a shows the isolation response versus frequency, with the isolation R(\u221218\u25e6)/R(+18\u25e6) (see Fig.\u00a01) reaching 41.75\u00a0dB at f sim0 . Note that the asymmetry in the curve of the isolation versus frequency is not due to a Fano resonance, despite its very similar asymmetric appearance. It rather results from taking the (mathematical) ratio of the two frequency responses of the structure for incidences at \u03b8i = \u00b118\u25e6 , which are themselves symmetric but different due to the nonreciprocal nature of the structure (see supplementary material). Figure\u00a04b shows the angular response of the reflection coefficient at the operating frequency of f sim0 , whose strong asymmetry with respect to broadside ( \u03b8i = 0 ) is the expected signature of the device.\nFigure\u00a05 presents the experimental results. Figure\u00a05a shows the prototype, composed of 2\u00d7 3 unit cells. It includes two FR4 substrates of thickness 1.6\u00a0mm glued together. The device was measured by a bistatic measurement system with two horn antennas symmetrically aiming (under the same angle with respect to the normal\n(16a)\u03c7yymm = \u2212 2j cos \u03b80 + (1+ e\nj\u03c6)k\u03c7 zzee sin 2 \u03b80\n(1+ ej\u03c6)k ,\n(16b)\u03c7 zyem = \u2212\u03c7 yz me \u2212\n2jej\u03c6 cot \u03b80 (1+ ej\u03c6)k .\nf\nx\nx y\ny\nz\nground plane\np\np\np\np\nl\nw\nv\nd\nq\nq\nh\nt\nt\n(a) (b)\nFigure\u00a03.

We derived, under the assumption of nongyrotropy, the corresponding bianisotropic susceptibility tensors, which include unusual, normal components, and which represent a novel type of nonreciprocity. We designed a metaparticle realizing these susceptibility tensors under the form of a U-shaped conducting structure loaded by a transistor, and demonstrated the overall metasurface by full-wave simulation and experimental results in the microwave regime.\nPotential applications of this device include nonreciprocal reflectors, nonreciprocal waveguide walls, nonreciprocal quantum state mediation, advanced analog processing, as well as more sophisticated nonreciprocal electromagnetic wave transformations.\nReceived: 18 February 2022; Accepted: 25 March 2022"
