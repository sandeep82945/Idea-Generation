Direct linearization method and Newton linearization method are presented to transform the nonlinear heat conduction equation into linear equations. The matrix form of nonlinear heat conduction equation is also obtained. Several numerical examples are provided to valid our schemes.\n1. Introduction\nIn this article, the nonlinear heat conduction equation is considered as\n\u2202u x, t\u00f0 \u00de \u2202t = c x, t, u\u00f0 \u00de \u2202 2u x, t\u00f0 \u00de \u2202x2 + F x, t, u, \u2202u x, t\u00f0 \u00de \u2202x , a \u2264 x \u2264 b, t \u2265 0,\n\u00f01\u00de\nwhere F\u00f0x, t, u, \u00f0\u2202u\u00f0x, t\u00de/\u2202x\u00de\u00de is the nonlinear term of u and ux , with initial condition\nu x, 0\u00f0 \u00de = f x\u00f0 \u00de, a \u2264 x \u2264 b, \u00f02\u00de\nand the boundary condition\nu a, t\u00f0 \u00de = \u03c61 t\u00f0 \u00de u b, t\u00f0 \u00de = \u03c62 t\u00f0 \u00de, t \u2265 0: \u00f03\u00de\nCombining (1)\u2013(3), we get nonlinear heat conduction equation.\nThe linear and nonlinear heat conduction equation is a second-order linear partial differential equation [1\u20136]. There are analytical and numerical methods to solve the linear/ nonlinearheat conduction equation. For the numerical\nmethods, there are the finite difference method, finite element method and boundary element method, the spectral method [7], etc.\nThe barycentric formula have been obtained by the Lagrange interpolation formula [8\u201310] and been used to solve Volterra equation and Volterra integro-differential equation [11\u201314]. Floater and Kai, Klein and Berrut [15\u201317] have proposed a rational interpolation scheme and get the equidistant node of the barycentric formula. In recent papers, references [18\u201325] have been extended the barycentric collocation methods to solve initial/boudary value problems and linear/nonlinear problems.\nIn this paper, the linear barycentric rational collocation method (LBRCM) for nonlinear heat conduction equation is presented. Direct linearization and Newton linearization are presented to transform the nonlinear heat conduction equation into linear equations. The matrix form of linearization scheme for nonlinear heat conduction equation is also obtained.\nThis paper is organized as follows: in Section 2, the linearization scheme for nonlinear heat conduction equation is given. Direct linearization and Newton linearization are constructed, and then the matrix form of LBRCM is also presented. At last, two numerical examples are listed to\nHindawi Journal of Applied Mathematics Volume 2022, Article ID 8998193, 9 pages https://doi.org/10.1155/2022/8998193\nillustrate our numerical scheme.\n2. Linearization\nDirect linearization and Newton linearization are presented to change the nonlinear heat conduction equation into linear equation. By choosing the equidistant nodes and Chebyshev nodes as collocation point to solve the nonlinear heat conduction equation, the direct linearization scheme can be adopted as\n\u2202u x, t\u00f0 \u00de \u2202t = c x, t, u0\u00f0 \u00de \u22022u x, t\u00f0 \u00de \u2202x2 + F x, t, u0, \u2202u0 x, t\u00f0 \u00de \u2202x ,\n\u2202un x, t\u00f0 \u00de \u2202t = c x, t, un\u22121\u00f0 \u00de \u22022un x, t\u00f0 \u00de \u2202x2 + F x, t, un\u22121, \u2202un\u22121 x, t\u00f0 \u00de \u2202x :\n\u00f04\u00de\nNewton linearization scheme can be adopted as\n\u2202u x, t\u00f0 \u00de \u2202t = c x, t, u\u00f0 \u00de \u2202 2u x, t\u00f0 \u00de \u2202x2 + F x, t, u0, \u2202u0 x, t\u00f0 \u00de \u2202x u \u2212 u0\u00f0 \u00de+\u22ef,\n\u00f05\u00de\nand then we get the Newton linearization as\n\u2202u x, t\u00f0 \u00de \u2202t = c x, t, u\u00f0 \u00de \u2202 2u x, t\u00f0 \u00de \u2202x2 + F x, t, u0, \u2202u0 x, t\u00f0 \u00de \u2202x u \u2212 u0\u00f0 \u00de,\n\u2202un x, t\u00f0 \u00de \u2202t = c x, t, un\u22121\u00f0 \u00de \u22022un x, t\u00f0 \u00de \u2202x2 + F x, t, un\u22121, \u2202un\u22121 x, t\u00f0 \u00de \u2202x un \u2212 un\u22121\u00f0 \u00de:\n\u00f06\u00de\nWe partition the interval \u00bda, b into a = x0 < x1 <\u22ef<xm = b, h = b \u2212 a/m and \u00bd0, T into 0 = t0 < t1 <\u22ef<tn = T , \u03c4 = T/n with \u03a9 = \u00bda, b \u00d7 \u00bd0, T and \u00f0xi, t j\u00de, i = 0, 1, 2,\u22ef,m ; j = 0, 1, 2,\u22ef, n.

Concluding Remarks\nThe nonlinear heat conduction equation is solved by LBRCM with direct linearization scheme and Newton linearization scheme, different from the finite difference methods with the time variable computed separately, while the LBRCM can get the space variable and time variable simultaneously. The matrix form of LBRCM with direct linearization scheme and Newton linearization scheme is given from the corresponding scheme, and numerical results are given to valid our scheme. In the table, the convergence of LBRCM for equidistant nodes and Chebyshev nodes has been given, while the theorem analysis of direct linearization scheme and Newton linearization scheme is out of goal in this paper which will be given in the near future.\nData Availability\nThe data that support the findings of this study are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request.\nConflicts of Interest\nThe author declares that he/she has no conflicts of interest.\nAcknowledgments\nThe work of Jin Li was supported by Natural Science Foundation of Hebei Province (Grant No. A2019209533).\nReferences\n[1] N.
