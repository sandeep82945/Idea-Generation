Despite this effective treatment, the longtime continuous\nthe Royal Society of Chemistry\nuse of NRTIs is necessary, which in turn leads to the emergence of drug-resistant HBV variants, which pose serious challenges.11\nWe have previously reported that purine nucleosides having a cyano group at the 4\u2032-position on the deoxyribosyl moiety, such as 2 and 3, exert potent anti-HBV activity compared to 1 not only against wild type but also against entecavir-resistant HBV.12 Molecular models of HBV-reverse transcriptase (RT) with corresponding triphosphate of 2 and 3 indicate that, 2 or 3- triphosphate is well accommodated in HBV-RT due to an excellent interaction between hydrophobic pockets of HBV-RT and 4\u2032-cyano group.12 Unfortunately, these purine nucleosides proved to be overly cytotoxic.

One would anticipate that if this radical technique was applied for the preparation of title molecule 6, then the stereoselectivity for the newly generated quaternary carbon center would decrease, due to the steric repulsion between the cyclic acetonide and the cyano group (or its masked form). Accordingly, we planned the novel synthetic route for 6 as depicted in Scheme 1 as a retrosynthetic analysis.\nTarget molecule 6 was prepared from alcohol A by the introduction of a guanine base under SN2 manner and deprotection. Cyanide A was prepared from B by deoxygenation of the 2-hydroxyl group and nitrile formation of the 4- formyl group. Aldehyde B was derived from cyclic acetal C by hydrolysis. The relative conguration of the 1-hydroxyl group\nScheme 1 Retrosynthetic analysis for 6.\n16000 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 15999\u201316011\nand the 4-formyl group must be xed at this stage.

The stannane D was converted from sulde E employing the radical-mediated stannylation.13 The bicyclo[2.2.1] system of E may be stereospecically constructed by a radical-mediated 5- exo-dig cyclization of carbon-centered radical F. Therefore, we started to prepare the corresponding radical precursor for F.\nThe ketone 7 having a 1-(S) conguration was stereoselectively protected from D-ribose by a reported method (Scheme 2).16 Treatment of 7 with the ylide (Ph3P]CHOMe) prepared from Ph3PCH2OMeCl and BuLi gave the enol ether 8 in 77% yield as a diastereomeric mixture (ca. 7 : 3, the\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

When the enol ether 8 was reacted with PhSeCl in the presence of a stoichiometric amount of pyridine at \u221280 \u00b0C, the required intramolecular selenoetherication readily proceeded to form seleno methyl glycoside 9 as a mixture of three diastereomers (ca. 20 : 12 : 1, the actual stereochemistries of the diastereomers were not determined at this stage). The desired radical precursor 10 was obtained in moderate yield aer the introduction of the PhS group at the terminal alkyne moiety of 9 via lithium acetylide (generated by LDA).\nWe next examined the radical-mediated cyclization of the precursor 10 (Table 1). When the selenide 10 was reacted with tris(trimethylsilyl)silane [(Me3Si)3SiH] in the presence of a catalytic amount of AIBN as an initiator in hot toluene, the desired 5-exo-digmode cyclization readily proceeded to afford the desired cyclic products having a methylenecyclopentane skeleton (Z)- and (E)-11 [the ratio of the (E)-/(Z)-conguration of 6\u2032-position was 8.0 : 1, entry 1]. The stereochemistry of both isomers was conrmed by NOE experiments as illustrated in Table 1 (see the Experimental section). The stereochemistries of the 4-position of both (Z)- and (E)-11 were completely controlled as (S)-conguration, as we expected before. The free rotation of both 3,4- and 4,5-carbon\u2013carbon bonds of the radical intermediate F\u2032 are certainly forbidden, due to the\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

Therefore, the radical cyclization stereospecically proceeded to give only (4S)-products, since the stereochemistry of the 1-position possessing a radical acceptor moiety of F\u2032 is (S)-conguration.\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 15999\u201316011 | 16001\nScheme 3 Radical-mediated sulfur-extrusive stannylation of 11.\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The use of Bu3SnH instead of (Me3Si)3SiH, on the other hand, lowered the ratio to 7.1 : 1 (entry 3). Further increase of the stereoselectivity was observed along with the decrease of the reaction temperature (entries 4 and 5). The high (E)-stereoselectivity of the 6\u2032-position might be derived from the steric repulsion between the bulky reductant (Me3Si)3SiH and trithyloxymethyl (TrOCH2\u2013) groups of the generated vinyl radical intermediate G, which may prevent an approach from the same face of the TrOCH2\u2013 group (Fig. 2).\nThe radical-mediated sulfur extrusive stannylation of 11 was next carried out (Scheme 3). When the sulde (E)-11 was treated with Bu3SnH and AIBN in the presence of i-Pr2NEt in hot toluene, the vinylstannanes (E)-12 (65%) and (Z)-12 (34%) were obtained, respectively. Stereochemical analysis of 12 was also conrmed by NOE experiments as depicted in Scheme 3 (see Experimental section). In the case of radical-stannylation for (Z)-11, on the other hand, (Z)-12 (83%) was the sole product. Similar results for these stereoselectivities were previously observed.13\nWe also conrmed the possibility of the direct one-pot conversion of sulde 10 into stannane 12 (Scheme 4). When the sulde 10 was reacted with Bu3SnH and AIBN in the\nScheme 4 One-pot conversion of sulfide 10 into stannane 12. (a) The reaction was carried out at 100 \u00b0C. (b) The reaction was carried out under the condition described in entry 4 (Table 1) before a treatment with Bu3SnH and AIBN.\n16002 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 15999\u201316011\npresence of i-Pr2NEt in heating toluene, the stannanes (E)-12 (49%) and (Z)-12 (33%) were obtained, respectively, and the ratio of (E)-12 : (Z)-12 was 1.48 : 1, Scheme 4a. As illustrated in Scheme 4b on the other hand, the yield of 12 was slightly increased when the residue containing (E)- and (Z)-11, which was prepared in a described manner in Table 1; entry 4, was reacted with Bu3SnH and AIBN. The ratio of (E)-12 : (Z)-12 was consistent with the results of Table 1 and Scheme 3. Therefore, the one-pot conversion without purication described in Scheme 4b should be comparable to the sequential manner.\nElectrophilic uorination of vinylstannanes 12 readily proceeded by treatment with XeF2 and AgOTf in the presence of 2,6- di-tert-butyl-4-methylpyridine (DTBMP).17,18 This gave the corresponding vinyl uorides (E)-13 and (Z)-13, respectively (Scheme 5). The vinyl uorides (E)-13 and (Z)-13 were converted to the cyanides (E)-14 and (Z)-14, respectively, by the following four-step sequence: (1) acidic hydrolysis of all of the acid labile protecting groups including the cyclic acetal function; (2) transformation of the generated formyl group into the corresponding oxime; (3) acetylation of all of the hydroxy groups include the oxime hydroxyl group and (4) b-elimination of the oxime acetate by the treatment with heating AcOH in the presence of a catalytic amount of NaOAc. In order to discriminate between the four hydroxyl groups of 14, we selected a cyclic protection technique, which has been frequently employed, especially for the selective protection of 3\u2032 and 5\u2032 hydroxyl groups of nucleosides. Aer deacetylation of (E)-14 by treatment with NH3/MeOH, the resulting tetraol was reacted with 1,3- dichloro-1,1,3,3-tetraisopropyldisiloxane (TIPDSCl2) in cold pyridine. Unexpectedly, the sole product was silyl ether (E)-15 in which the primary alcohol remained and the two secondary alcohols were protected instead. A similar result was observed in the case of (Z)-14; this might be due to the steric hindrance around the primary alcohol derived from (E)- and (Z)-14. Protection of these free hydroxyl groups in (E)-15 and (Z)-15 was carried out by the reaction with BOMCl. cis-Diols (E)-16 and (Z)16 were prepared, respectively, aer desilylation in moderate yields. The secondary alcohol of (E)-16 was selectively protected again into (E)-17 using bulky TBSCl. However, in the case of (Z)16, mono silylether (Z)-17 was obtained as an inseparable mixture with (Z)-17a (ca. 3 : 2 of diastereomeric mixture).\nIn order to reduce the free 2-hydroxyl group, (E)- and (Z)-17 were treated with triic anhydride into the corresponding triate (Scheme 6); the reaction of the triate with lithium iodide\n\u00a9 2023 The Author(s).

            "text": "Our previous ndings that nucleosides 2, 3, (E)-4, and 5 are strong candidates for anti-HBV agents encouraged us to carry out this study. Synthesis of the entecavir analogues 6 possessing a cyano group and uorine atom at 4\u2032- and 6\u2032\u2032-position was accomplished based on radical-mediated stereospecic 5-exo dig mode cyclization of 10, sulfur-extrusive stannylation of 11 and subsequent electrophilic uorination into 13, and construction of the cyano group employing the formyl group generated by hydrolysis of 13, which was located at the chiral quaternary carbon, as representative steps. Both diastereomers (E)- and (Z)-6 were synthesized aer deoxygenation, the introduction of guanine base, and global deprotection. Of the two diastereomers 6 synthesized in this study, (E)-6 showed higher anti-HBV activity than (Z)-6 and parent compound 1 with lower cytotoxicity than that of 1. Molecular models suggested that both the cyano group and uorine atoms of (E)-6 have strong interactions with HBVWT-RT and must be partly responsible for its high anti-HBV activity."

Chemical shis are reported relative to Me4Si, except for uorine-containing compounds where CFCl3 was used as an internal standard. Mass spectra (MS) were taken in FAB mode with m-nitrobenzyl alcohol as amatrix. Column chromatography was carried out on silica gel (Micro Bead Silica Gel PSQ 100B, Fuji Silysia Chemical Ltd.) or neutral silica gel (Silica Gel 60N, Kanto Chemical Co., Inc.). Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) was performed on precoated silica gel plate F254.

On days 3 and 7 aer plating, the culture medium was removed and the fresh medium and a drug were replenished. On day 14, the cells were harvested for DNA collection and the DNA samples were extracted from the cells using QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions and were resuspended in 100 mL Tris\u2013EDTA buffer. Total cellular DNA samples were amplied using the Genesig Advanced Kit for quantication of hepatitis B virus genomes (PrimerDesign\u2122Ltd., Southampton, UK) and Applied Biosystems\u00ae 7500 Fast Real-time PCR System (Life Technologies Japan Ltd., Tokyo Japan). PCR preparations were incubated at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, followed by 50 cycles at 95 \u00b0C for 10 s and 60 \u00b0C for 1min. The data were analyzed using 7500 Fast Soware Version 2.0.6 (Life Technologies Japan Ltd., Tokyo Japan), and threshold cycle (CT) values were obtained. To derive the HBV copy numbers from the CT values, a standard curve was generated with 10-fold serial dilutions of an HBV plasmid. The amount of HBV DNA in each assay sample with a test compound was compared to no-compound control samples, and 50% effective concentration (EC50) was determined using the Forecast function of Microso Excel soware. The cytotoxicities of the compounds in HepG2.2.15 cells were also determined. Cells were plated in a 96-well plate at a density of 2\u00d7 103 cells in 200 mL per well and were continuously exposed to the compound at a certain concentration for 14 days. The number of viable cells in each well was determined using the Cell Counting Kit-8 (Dojindo, Kumamoto, Japan), compared to no-compound control samples, and 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC50) values were determined."

The HBV-RT model was built by homology modeling using sequence homology between HBV-RT and HIV-RT.12 (E)-6-TP was generated by suitable modications to ETV-TP. Minimization of the (E)-6-HBV-RTWT (pt) complex in the OPLS3 force eld as implemented in Maestro version 10.7.015 (Schr\u00f6dinger, LLC, New York) was carried out.
