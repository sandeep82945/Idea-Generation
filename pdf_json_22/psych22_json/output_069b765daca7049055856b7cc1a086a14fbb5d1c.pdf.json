Psychologic interventions have not been extensively studied in the context of alleviating biosimilar hesitancy. The objective of this study was to assess the effectiveness of psychologic interventions on biosimilar confidence. Methods: Following institutional review board (IRB) approval, 1285 subjects with self-reported psoriasis were recruited using Amazon Mechanical Turk, an online crowdsourcing platform. Participants were randomized to one of ten groups. Group A started with a hypothetical bio-originator; group B started with a hypothetical biosimilar. The remaining groups were provided a hypothetical scenario in which they were switching to a biosimilar after achieving great results with a bio-originator, and were randomized to receive either no reassurance (group C) or one of the following psychologic interventions: reassurance of comparable effectiveness (group D), an illustration implying comparable effectiveness (group E), anecdote of great results obtained in \u2018\u2018other psoriasis patients\u2019\u2019 (group F), anecdote of great results obtained in another psoriasis patient \u2018\u2018a lot like you\u2019\u2019 (group G), reassurance of the rigorous evaluation process to gain Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval (group H), engagement in a task designed to facilitate recognition of biosimilars\u2019 comparability through answering multiple choice (group I) or free response questions (group J). Confidence levels were assessed using six-point Likert scales and analyzed using one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and two-group t-tests.

            "text": "Many of the psychologic interventions assessed in this study are easily implementable techniques that can be utilized by clinicians to improve dermatology patient outcomes. For example, presenting clinical evidence and providing anecdotes of treatment success can improve caregiver willingness to treat childhood atopic dermatitis with corticosteroids [8]. Engagement can increase willingness to initiate biologic treatment in psoriasis patients [9]. Improving confidence in biosimilar drugs is an important step toward expanding access to effective psoriasis medications. However, it does not appear biosimilar confidence is much improved by the psychologic interventions assessed in the present study nor by our previous study which involved positively framing them as the \u2018\u2018gold\u2019\u2019 alternative to bio-originators [10].\nThis study has several limitations. Our quantitative approach did not allow for collection of qualitative concerns about biosimilars to guide the development of future interventions aimed at addressing patients\u2019 skepticism. Mechanical Turk is more effective at producing high quality data with short and simple experiments than with open-ended questions, thus descriptive results such as subjects\u2019 baseline knowledge of biosimilars and subjective concerns were not assessed [11]. It is unclear whether participants\u2019 responses reflect their true decisions as hypothetical cognitive-based scenarios may fail to accurately simulate real-world clinical situations. Mechanical Turk is primarily used in psychometric analysis to evaluate general trends and attitudes; its validity as a research tool in dermatology is not yet well\nestablished and its sample population may not be strongly representative of specific populations such as patients with psoriasis [12, 13]. While our sample had a higher proportion of racial minorities than may be typical of psoriasis cohorts, and participants were not clinically evaluated in person, subjects were asked to participate only if they had histories of psoriasis; our data collection occurred over an 8 month period which may reflect the time required to accumulate subjects who actually had psoriasis. Although it is possible that some participants did not truly carry formal diagnoses of psoriasis, disease-naive and/or treatmentnaive individuals may have perspectives on biosimilars that are similar to patients who are not well attuned to their condition. Because we aimed to randomize participants across several interventions, generating a sample through alternative methods, such as using ICD-10 codes, may have precluded adequate sample size and/or a timely investigation. Convenience sampling through Mechanical Turk allowed for relatively quick and cost-effective data collection on a large scale.\nOur recruitment methods are subject to inherent selection bias. Mechanical Turk users are typically more highly educated than the general population, and a considerable proportion (67.4%) of our sample held a bachelor\u2019s degree or higher [12]. Individuals with higher educational attainment may be more attuned to their conditions and might be better able to navigate the analysis of graphs than those with lower education levels. Another potential concern with Mechanical Turk\u2019s user base is the presence of highly active and experienced workers (\u2018\u2018Super Turkers\u2019\u2019) who may be familiar with survey questions; their participation can compromise data quality from reduced responsiveness to experimental manipulations and/or inflation of measures of ability due to learning or practice effects [11, 12].\nTable 2 Confidence scores for each randomized group"

We believe it can be a particularly useful and sufficiently valid method of detecting highly effective interventions that produce large differences; none of the interventions we tested appeared highly effective."

            "text": "Although psychologic interventions can positively impact patient outcomes, the reassurance techniques assessed in this study do not appear to have a significant effect on confidence in biosimilars. Reiterating the rigorous evaluation process that biosimilars undergo to gain FDA approval and/or providing patients with illustrations depicting biosimilars\u2019 comparability to bio-originators appear to produce small improvements in biosimilar confidence and may be interventions to focus on for future development. While identifying highly effective simple strategies for improving perceptions of biosimilar drugs remains a challenge, negative findings can help influence the design of future experiments, reduce duplications of effort, and prevent randomly positive results from falsely appearing promising."
