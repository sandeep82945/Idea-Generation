For protons there is a long-range Coulomb repulsion, while no Coulomb interaction exists between neutrons. Then, a naive question arises: can a pure neutron system exist? A pure neutron system seems to be more bound because there is no Coulomb repulsion between neutrons. However, no bound pure neutron system has been found except in neutron stars where neutrons are squeezed together by the huge gravitational force. From a simple phenomenological macroscopic point of view, an atomic nucleus can be considered as a droplet with volume, surface and Coulomb energies. Indeed, the Coulomb repulsion reduces the binding energy of the nucleus, which means that the Coulomb energy is not conducive to the binding of the nucleus. However, there exists a quantum term, called the symmetry energy proposed by Wigner, which arises from the Pauli exclusion of identical particles. In the symmetry energy term, the asymmetry in the number of neutrons and protons results in a decrease in the binding energy of the nucleus, which means that the symmetry energy prefers similar numbers of neutrons and protons to very different numbers. Therefore, according to the phenomenological liquid drop model, the Coulomb energy and symmetry energy compete to balance the numbers of neutrons and protons to make the nucleus lower in energy. In a microscopic framework of the shell model, neutrons and protons occupy their respective single-particle levels, and prefer their Fermi surfaces close to each other making the A-body nucleon system lower in energy. A nucleus can balance its neutron and proton numbers through the \u03b2 transition in which a neutron (proton) is converted into a proton (neutron) by the emission of an electron (positron) accompanied by an antineutrino (neutrino). The neutron and proton can be approximately treated as the same type of Fermions by introducing an isospin quantum number, e.g., defining the isospin projection tz = 1/2 for neutron and \u22121/2 for proton. Then, the nucleus appears with an isospin quantum number as well, similarly to the spin number of its angular momentum, with an isospin projection Tz = 2 (N \u2212 Z) measuring the difference in the number of neutrons and protons. Figure 1 plots the ground-state energies of A = 4 nuclear systems. We see that the A = 4 energy is minimized at Tz = 0, i.e., at the 4He nucleus in which the neutron number is equal to the proton number. While the Tz = 0 4He is well bound, the Tz = \u22121 4Li and Tz = +1 4H are unbound resonances which are above the 3He+p and 3H+n breakup thresholds, respectively.",

            "text": "Can a pure neutron state of matter exist?\nFurong Xu\nState Key Laboratory of Nuclear Physics and Technology, School of Physics, Peking University, Beijing 100871, China\nAtomic nucleus is a self-organized system composed of protons and neutrons through the short-range attractive nuclear force. For protons there is a long-range Coulomb repulsion, while no Coulomb interaction exists between neutrons. Then, a naive question arises: can a pure neutron system exist? A pure neutron system seems to be more bound because there is no Coulomb repulsion between neutrons. However, no bound pure neutron system has been found except in neutron stars where neutrons are squeezed together by the huge gravitational force.\nFrom a simple phenomenological macroscopic point of view, an atomic nucleus can be considered as a droplet with volume, surface and Coulomb energies.

In the symmetry energy term, the asymmetry in the number of neutrons and protons results in a decrease in the binding energy of the nucleus, which means that the symmetry energy prefers similar numbers of neutrons and protons to very different numbers.

A nucleus can balance its neutron and proton numbers through the \u03b2 transition in which a neutron (proton) is converted into a proton (neutron) by the emission of an electron (positron) accompanied by an antineutrino (neutrino).

Then, the nucleus appears with an isospin quantum number as well, similarly to the spin number of its angular momentum, with an isospin projection Tz = 12 (N \u2212 Z) measuring the difference in the number of neutrons and protons.\nFigure 1 plots the ground-state energies of A = 4 nuclear systems. We see that the A = 4 energy is minimized at Tz = 0, i.e., at the 4He nucleus in which the neutron number is equal to the proton number. While the Tz = 0 4He is well bound, the Tz = \u22121 4Li and Tz = +1 4H are unbound resonances which are above the 3He+p and 3H+n breakup thresholds, respectively.\n\u2217frxu@pku.edu.cn\nTherefore, a pure neutron system is not favored, though the Coulomb interaction between protons is repulsive. The manybody correlations of a nuclear system favor a certain balance in the number of neutrons and protons.\nNevertheless, it is still possible that pure neutron systems might exist in the form of resonances. The first pure neutron system that comes to mind may be the dineutron with two neutrons (2n), which is unbound by only about 100 keV. However, the two neutrons stay in the l = 0 s-wave with zero centrifugal barrier, and therefore no 2n resonance is possible. However, a pure four-neutron (4n) system, called the tetraneutron, was speculated about 60 years ago, and has been sought ever since. Unfortunately, no firm evidence for a bound 4n state has been obtained. Whether can the 4n system exist in the form of resonance? Indeed, an experiment performed in 2016 at RIKEN, using the double-charge-exchange (DCX) reaction 4He(8He, 8Be) [1], indicates the possibility of the existence of the tetraneutron resonance, though the conclusion cannot be definitely made due to the large experimental uncertainty. Many theoretical attempts have also been made to investigate possible multineutron systems. Most theoretical investigations do not support bound multineutrons [2, 3, 4], instead suggesting multineutron resonances [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]. Among the theories, first-principles calculations based on realistic nuclear forces are fascinating. However, one also needs to well treat the neutron correlations including the coupling to the continuum [9].\nAfter the DCX reaction 4He(8He, 8Be) experiment done in 2016 [1], an international collaboration team performed another fascinating experiment using the knockout reaction 8He(p, p4He), published in Nature recently [11]. In the experiment, the high-energy 8He secondary beam was projected onto a target of protons. The 8He nucleus has a structure of four valence neutrons outside the \u03b1 core (i.e., 4He). In the quasielastic knockout reaction, the \u03b1 core was removed from 8He by a target proton, leaving a 4n system moving on. The experiment [11] did not directly measure the 4n system, but detected the knocked-out \u03b1-particle and the scattered proton. By the missing mass reconstruction, the energy spectrum of the 4n system can be obtained, which gives a well pronounced peak at an energy of 2.37\u00b10.38(statistical error)\u00b10.44(systematic error) MeV near the 4n threshold, suggesting a resonance-like structure of the 4n system [11]. This suggestion of a 4n resonance is in agreement with the DCX reaction 4He(8He, 8Be) experiment [1], but with much higher experimental precisions. A resonance width was extracted, \u0393=1.75\u00b1 0.22(stat.)\u00b10.30(sys.) MeV, which corresponds to a lifetime of only (3.8\u00b10.8)\u00d710\u221222 seconds [11].\nPreprint submitted to Science Bulletin\nar X\niv :2\n30 1.\n02 78\n3v 1\n[ nu\ncl -t\nh] 7\nJ an\n2 02\n3\nCertainly, more experimental and theoretical studies are necessary to further understand the nature of the observed peak in the missing mass spectrum [11] and also to exclude other possibilities, e.g., the peak manifesting itself as a possible coupling among the 4n and other ingredients surrounding the reaction channel, as commented in Refs. [12, 13]. A direct detection of the 4n system should be of most value. The measurement of the momentum correlation of the four neutrons can give more insights into the structure of the 4n system. Choosing different reaction mechanisms would provide additional information about the properties of the 4n system. Nevertheless, combined with the recent state-of-the-art first-principles calculations [6- 10], a tetraneutron resonance is highly likely. Figure 2 displays the ab initio predictions based on no-core shell model (NCSM) [5, 6] and no-core Gamow shell model (NCGSM) [9], along with the energies and widths of the 4n peaks obtained in the experiments [1, 11]. We see that the newest experimental result published in Nature [11] is in excellent agreement with the theoretical prediction made by the elaborated ab initio NCGSM [9]. Starting from a fundamental chiral nuclear force, the NCGSM [9] treated well the coupling to the continuum by using the complex-momentum Berggren ensemble. The continuum effect is important in the calculation for a resonant state. The use of natural orbitals includes more correlations [9].\nThe ab initio calculations [7, 9] have even showed that a three-neutron (3n) resonance is possible with a lower energy and narrower width than the 4n resonance. Though it has been commented that the 3n resonance may be less likely to exist due to the odd number of nucleons and thus weaker binding [11], one probably should not consider it with the pairing mechanism of even-number nucleon systems. One might treat it as a whole with full three-body correlations and three-nucleon force. For\nthe 4n system, a realistic four-nucleon force may also need to be considered.\nMultineutron resonances provide a unique playground for the studies of neutron-neutron interaction and many-body correlations of pure neutron systems. One can study neutron-proton and proton-proton interactions by neutron-proton and protonproton scatterings, respectively, but neutron-neutron scattering is not an idea to study the neutron-neutron interaction because no pure neutron target is available. Further studies of the pure neutron states of matter are necessary to answer the fundamental questions of nuclear physics and the impacts, e.g., on the nuclear processes of nuclear astrophysics."
