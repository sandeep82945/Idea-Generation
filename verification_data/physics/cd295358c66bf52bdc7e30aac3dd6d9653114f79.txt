"We devised a facile method of preparing nanocellulose/alginate composite beads with increased adsorption performance derived from the in situ TEMPO oxidation of the hydroxyl groups of cellulose. Oxidation of the beads increased the number of carboxyl groups which can facilitate the removal of cationic impurities from aqueous samples. The enhancement of removal efficiency of the cationic dye MB and Cd2+ was confirmed with UV-vis measurements (for MB), EDS, and XPS (for Cd2+). Interestingly, the EDS elemental analysis of the beads showed an almost 3-fold improvement in Cd2+ removal after the in situ oxidation. Furthermore, the obtained water flux data indicates that the prepared beads can be used for the manufacturing of column filters. This approach offers filters with a higher amount of adsorbent and better water permeability than 2D membrane filters. Overall, the abundance of the component feedstock, as well as the ease and efficiency of the modification route indicate that the nanocomposite beads are promising candidates for larger production and manufacturing of column filters for water purification."
