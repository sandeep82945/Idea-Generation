    "abstractText": "BACKGROUND: Language concordance can increase access to care for patients with language barriers and improve patient health outcomes. However, systematically assessing and tracking physician non-English language skills remains uncommon in most health systems. This is a missed opportunity for health systems to maximize language-concordant care. OBJECTIVE: To determine barriers and facilitators to participation in non-English language proficiency assessment among primary care physicians. DESIGN: Qualitative, semi-structured interviews. PARTICIPANTS: Eleven fully and partially bilingual primary care physicians from a large academic health system with a language certification program (using a clinician oral proficiency interview). APPROACH: Interviews aimed to identify barriers and facilitators to participation in non-English language assessment. Two researchers independently and iteratively coded transcripts using a thematic analysis approach with constant comparison to identify themes. KEY RESULTS: Most participants were women (N= 9; 82%). Participants reported proficiency in Cantonese, Mandarin, Russian, and Spanish. All fully bilingual participants (n=5) had passed the language assessment; of the partially bilingual participants (n=6), four did not test, one passed with marginal proficiency, and one did not pass. Three themes emerged as barriers to assessment participation: (1) beliefs about the negative consequences (emotional and material) of not passing the test, (2) time constraints and competing demands, and (3) challenging test format and structure. Four themes emerged as facilitators to increase assessment adoption: (1) messaging consistent with professional ethos, (2) organizational culture that incentivizes certification, (3) personal empowerment about language proficiency, and (4) individuals championing certification. CONCLUSIONS: To increase language assessment participation and thus ensure quality language-concordant care, health systems must address the identified barriers physicians experience and leverage potential facilitators. Findings can inform health system interventions to standardize the requirements and process, increase transparency, provide resources for preparation and remediation, utilize messaging focused on patient care quality and safety, and incentivize participation.",

This review also found a positive impact on patient care experience and communication, Received November 15, 2022 Accepted July 25, 2023\n3099\nJ Gen Intern Med 38(14):3099-106~\nGarcia et al.: Physician Non-English Language Proficiency Assessment Implementation JGIM\nwith patients reporting higher satisfaction with care, better health education, enhanced privacy, enhanced communication, fewer lingering questions about care, and increased therapeutic alliance with physicians.\nYet physician use of semi-proficient non-English language skills can pose problems and risks to patient care. For example, care provided by partially fluent physicians, such as after completion of \u201cmedical Spanish\u201d courses without subsequent assessment of their proficiency, can be as problematic as using ad hoc interpreters (i.e., family, friends, or untrained staff).18,19 Inadequate skills can lead to errors in communication and care, including more errors of omission and physician, rather than patient, centered communication.7,19\u201321\nThus, assessing physician non-English language proficiency and providing health system certification for such language use are crucial components to ensuring language access and providing high-quality care for patients with LEP. Despite this, physician non-English language skill use in clinical care is inconsistently assessed and tracked, representing a missed opportunity to maximize languageconcordant care.18 The objective of this qualitative study was to understand clinician barriers to non-English language proficiency assessment and potential facilitators to increase clinician adoption of language certification."

Participants were asked about their use of professional interpreters during clinical encounters and, if applicable, perceptions of the current language proficiency assessment. We invited potential participants via email, with the goal of interviewing approximately equal numbers of clinicians from the following groups: monolingual English, fully bilingual, and partially bilingual. We define fully bilingual as clinicians who reported their non-English language skills as \u201cvery good\u201d or \u201cexcellent\u201d and partially bilingual clinicians as those reporting \u201cgood\u201d on the Interagency Language Reporting (ILR) scale.24 For the current study, we included only the interviews with fully and partially bilingual clinicians. Each interview lasted 30\u201345 min and was conducted in-person or via video conferencing according to the participant\u2019s preference. Participants were provided with written information\nand then consented verbally prior to the interview. Once the two interviewers felt that no new concepts or topics were emerging, thematic saturation was reached, and no further interviews were conducted.25"

            "heading": "Themes",
            "text": "Three themes emerged as barriers to proficiency testing, while four themes emerged as facilitators that could increase the adoption of testing.\nBarriers to Proficiency Testing. Theme 1: Beliefs About the Negative Consequences (Emotional and Material) of Not Passing Test Participants described concerns about not passing the test, such as potential feelings of loss or guilt about overusing their language skills. They additionally worried that not passing the test could threaten their personal and professional identity. Participants described uncertainty about what would happen if they did not pass the test and whether privileges would be revoked or whether remediation or retaking the test was possible.\nParticipants expressed fear of losing their privileges to communicate in a non-English language if they did not pass the proficiency test. This was regardless of whether participants were fully or partially bilingual and had taken the test or not. One participant noted, \u201cI\u2019ve been doing this all along. What a bummer it would be if that privilege got taken away from me. I definitely hesitated to do the training or to go through the certification.\u201d (P1, bilingual, Spanish, passed). Another participant emphasized patient preference for language concordance and potential loss of patient-clinician rapport; \u201cpatients prefer that, even if I don\u2019t have perfect language skills...They feel more comfortable with that oneon-one interaction rather than having the third person...for most things, I\u2019m fluent enough\u201d (P5, partially bilingual, Mandarin, not tested).\nParticipants were also concerned that testing would reveal they were using a non-English language without adequate proficiency and potentially providing substandard quality care to patients. One participant noted, \u201cI was a little bit nervous about [taking the test] because I was gonna feel guilty if it said I wasn\u2019t [proficient], and then I had been using Spanish all these years\u201d (P10, bilingual, Spanish,\npassed). This concern was expressed by both partially and fully bilingual participants.\nParticipants further described that failing the test would feel like judgement or criticism of their roles or capacity as physicians and that care would need to be taken to remind \u201cyou that failure is not actually the end or your patient care skills...I think it\u2019s just some reassurance that this is not reflective of who you are as a human being.\u201d (P3, partially bilingual, Russian, not tested). Among bicultural physicians, there was also the concern that failing the test would feel like a negative judgement of their cultural heritage. A selfidentified Mexican-American participant noted \u201cI took the language test as an intern, and I got a 79% which was a hit to my ego. I felt like a bad representative of my culture, especially with it being my first language.\u201d (P11, partially bilingual, Spanish, tested marginal).\nParticipants expressed uncertainty about the possibility of remediation, whether there would be resources available to improve language skills, and the timeline to retake the test if desired. One participant stressed \u201cI think if the medical center said, okay if you want to be proficient but you\u2019re not quite proficient through our testing, let\u2019s figure out alternative things, alternative ways. Either helping you, figuring out are there materials that can help you, helping you get to that proficiency.\u201d (P5, partially bilingual, Mandarin, not tested).\nTheme 2: Time Constraints and Competing Demands Participants described prioritization of time and competing priorities as barriers to proficiency testing. Furthermore, the lack of a clear mandate to obtain certification led participants to prioritize other demands, such as clinical and administrative duties. As one participant described, \u201cIf it\u2019s not really required in any way and there\u2019s not really an incentive to do it, then why do it\u2026[it] manages to slip to the bottom of the list every time if there\u2019s not really a deadline or a payment or a requirement for it.\u201d (P10, bilingual, Spanish, passed).\nTheme 3: Challenging Test Format and Structure Participants felt that the test was not representative of a patient-physician conversation, that the register and difficulty of the test were too high, and that the uniform content used in the testing was not applicable to their clinical practice. They further described a dislike of testing in general, which made language assessment more challenging.\nParticipants perceived that the test was not reflective of routine ambulatory clinical practice. They felt the test inhibited back-and-forth communication and the opportunity to clarify meaning and patient understanding. One participant described the one-way interaction via telephonic test as \u201cspeaking into the void.\u201d Participants questioned whether the test was therefore truly the gold standard for proficiency, with one participant emphasizing, \u201cIt is awkward\u2026It\u2019s like a recording, you just speak into\n3101\nGarcia et al.: Physician Non-English Language Proficiency Assessment Implementation JGIM\nblank space. There are lots of nonverbal cues that you do when you are in an interaction with a patient that also matter, that help get your point across rather than just words.\u201d (P5, partially bilingual, Mandarin, not tested).\nPhysicians additionally perceived the test to be hard, either from taking the test (even if they passed), starting the test (but not completing), or speaking to someone else about the test. Furthermore, participants expressed concern that the assessment was not reflective of the health literacy of patients they saw in clinical practice. One participant remembered taking the test and thinking, \u201cGosh, this is hard. And I don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to pass, because I don\u2019t use a lot of technical terms. A lot of my patients aren\u2019t that educated. \u2026We wanted sixth, seventh grade education level and bring it down to that level\u201d (P6, bilingual, Cantonese, passed).\nParticipants, who were all general internists, additionally felt that uniform content that included specialized (such as describing HIV transmission in detail) or cross-specialty scenarios (with pediatric or gynecologic examples) was off-putting. One participant remembered, \u201cI looked at some of the practice cases and they were so different from what we talk about in our visits\u2026They might ask me about how to talk to a child or a pregnant woman\u2026I\u2019m like, \u2018But that\u2019s not what I\u2019m going to talk about.\u2019 Is it truly relevant to what I\u2019m talking about every single day with patients?\u201d (P3, partially bilingual, Russian, not tested).\nFinally, participants expressed general reluctance to test, particularly in the context of feeling over-tested and the need to maintain regular health system and specialty training requirements. High proficiency speakers particularly felt that testing was unnecessary and onerous, with one participant explaining, \u201cI was ambivalent because I hate taking tests and I didn\u2019t want to do it. I know I have a high proficiency because I lived and studied in Asia.\u201d (P2, bilingual, Mandarin, passed)\nFacilitators to Increase Adoption of Assessment. Theme 1: Messaging Consistent with Professional Ethos Physicians felt that appealing to professional identity or role, with an emphasis on providing patient-centered care, would be more effective in motivating physicians to test than punitive messaging or requirements. One physician emphasized \u201cmost providers care about their patients and they want to do right by the patient.\u201d (P6, bilingual, Cantonese, passed). Participants preferred messaging that highlighted the importance of knowing physician language proficiency to ensure quality patient care.\nTheme 2: Organizational Culture That Values and Incentivizes Certification Participants expressed that an organizational culture that values and incentivizes certification, either with recognition, financial incentives, or support and resources to prepare for the test or remediation resources if they did not\npass, as well as a clear mandate or policy for certification would promote increased participation in testing.\nParticipants believed that if the organization provided recognition that being certified matters, and that being bilingual is an asset, it would serve as an incentive to test. One partially bilingual physician noted, \u201cif it was something that leadership and other people were putting out there, like this is a great thing that we should be doing, that would incentivize me, too.\u201d (P11, partially bilingual, Spanish, tested marginal). Participants suggested that recognition could take the form of public acknowledgement of bilingual skills, through health system messaging about the importance and contribution of bilingual providers to patient care, or financial incentives to enable more physicians to prioritize the language proficiency test.\nSuggestions for support also included clinical credit or blocking off time from clinical care to test, support to prepare for the test, and remediation resources if they did not pass. Partially bilingual participants, especially, expressed that opportunities for growth, via feedback on their proficiency after taking the test, or resources for improvement would increase testing. One participant explained it \u201cwould encourage me to take the test knowing that there\u2019s something else on the other side where I might be able to get better and eventually pass as well.\u201d (P4, partially bilingual, Mandarin, not tested).\nFinally, physicians felt that the current policy for testing was unclear, with vague consequences for not testing. A partially bilingual physician said one potential motivator to testing \u201cwould be if there was a mandate that if you weren\u2019t certified, that you had to use an interpreter. Which I think there is that expectation now, except I don\u2019t think it\u2019s followed, it\u2019s not audited, and nobody really pays attention to that.\u201d (P5, partially bilingual, Mandarin, not tested). Thus, a policy that was uniformly applied and understood throughout the organization would incentivize bilingual physicians to test their language proficiency.\nTheme 3: Reassurance and Empowerment About Personal Language Proficiency Participants described scenarios when passing or not passing the test could provide reassurance and empowerment about an individual\u2019s language proficiency, including both not needing or needing to work with a professional interpreter.\nParticipants felt that passing the test provided personal reassurance that they could conduct a clinical visit with a patient with LEP without the assistance of an interpreter. One participant said, \u201cI do want a reassurance that I\u2019m able to provide the proficient amount of Mandarin. So I\u2019m not putting my patient at a disadvantage by just getting by.\u201d (P8, bilingual, Mandarin, passed). Similarly, for physicians who did not speak a trainee\u2019s non-English language, knowledge that a trainee was certified served as reassurance that trainees\n3102\nGarcia et al.: Physician Non-English Language Proficiency Assessment ImplementationJGIM\ncould conduct clinical visits with patients in that language without the use of an interpreter, \u201cI like it because I can trust when a resident is certified, I can trust the information that they\u2019ve received from the patient as much as somebody with English-English concordance.\u201d (P7, partially bilingual, Spanish, not tested).\nConversely, physicians reported that not passing the test could provide a sense of relief in certain circumstances where they doubted the extent of their language proficiency. This was particularly true when there was patient preference or pressure for the provider to \u201cget by\u201d with existing language skills. As one participant noted, \u201cI think I was actually relieved that I failed [the test] so then I could feel more like, yeah, I really do need an interpreter with me all the time. It empowered me to still use one.\u201d (P9, partially bilingual, Mandarin, did not pass).\nParticipants described that reassurance that they could still use an interpreter, even if they were certified in a specific language, could serve as an incentive to test. Bilingual physicians described that while they feel confident in their language skills in most circumstances, they understand that language proficiency is a spectrum and often situational. Therefore, in certain circumstances, such as in complex discussions or goals of care conversations, some still preferred to use an interpreter or have one available for back-up, since, as a participant explained, \u201cI would have an interpreter present because I think the threshold to pass the exam is not necessarily the threshold to have a conversation of that depth [with] a lot of patients.\u201d (P11, partially bilingual, Spanish, tested marginal).\nTheme 4: Individuals Championing Certification Participants suggested that messaging from trusted individuals could also be leveraged to increase adoption in the future, \u201cI think a testimonial or a video from somebody who they might recognize to say why it\u2019s important, what that does for patient care\u2026I think the way it was messaged\u2026it almost seemed like it could be punitive to the providers. And so, maybe different messaging. Hearing from a provider, this is why it\u2019s important for patient care, might get more buy-in.\u201d (P1, bilingual, Spanish, passed). Participants stressed that champions or role models could encourage proficiency testing; participants could further query these individuals regarding test format, structure, and difficulty level."

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "Our study identified salient barriers and facilitators to language proficiency assessment in one academic health system. While some of the barriers were specific to the CCLA test format and structure, others related to emotionally charged concerns about the consequences of failing the test and how to balance testing with competing demands and time constraints. Importantly, participants valued certification and\nthe reassurance it provided about using (or not using) their non-English language proficiency skills or trusting trainees\u2019 bilingual language skills.\nTo ensure quality language-concordant care for patients with LEP, we must increase non-English language assessment and certification of clinicians using validated tools. The complexity and nuance of the decision to undergo a non-English language proficiency assessment were reflected in the identified themes. Health systems can use these findings to develop targeted interventions to start or improve a language assessment and certification process in their unique settings, prioritizing the most salient barriers and enablers in their contexts and implementing intervention strategies and policies that address identified barriers/enablers a priori (see Table\u00a01).\nCertification may be most useful in helping partially bilingual providers make the decision to use or not use an interpreter.26,31,32 Participants in our study described that the test served as reassurance regarding their language skills, whether or not they passed. While imperfect, testing takes some of the guesswork out of whether partially bilingual physicians should be using their skills in clinical care. Partially bilingual individuals may inappropriately use their language skills when they miscalculate the complexity or risk for miscommunication, overestimate the patient\u2019s English proficiency, or miscalculate their own non-English proficiency.33 This may be particularly true after short medical non-English language courses which may give clinicians a false sense of fluency.19,32,34,35 Formal assessment may help clinicians take a realistic view of their own language proficiency skills.19,32\nHealth systems can take some immediate steps to increase non-English language proficiency testing [Table\u00a01]. They can clarify requirements and mandates for assessment and standardize the process by encouraging assessment when people are hired in the organization or with regular privilege renewal processes. This would automate assessment and further demonstrate to patients and clinicians that health systems value certification. Health systems can provide additional information about the format, structure, and scoring and clearly define the next steps if clinicians do not pass the assessment. Health systems can share resources to help clinicians with marginal language proficiency improve their skills. They can also provide guidance as to how the assessment results should be interpreted, and that passing the assessment does not preclude using an interpreter. Increasing language access for patients with LEP is an unfunded mandate, yet health systems must balance the cost of interpreters and certification programs with the economic consequences of miscommunication, such as through malpractice lawsuits or other legal action.30\nMessaging regarding testing should focus on providing quality care for patients, consistent with a clinician\u2019s professional ethos. Campaigns should utilize positive messaging\n3103\nGarcia et al.: Physician Non-English Language Proficiency Assessment Implementation JGIM\nand incorporate champions and clinical leaders, rather than messaging focused on the punitive aspects of assessment (i.e., loss of privileges). Results indicate a need for sensitivity to the emotional components associated with assessment, as identified by bilingual and bicultural clinicians in this study. Health system messaging should focus on the situational and contextual nature of proficiency and clarify that even certified clinicians may need to use interpreters in certain circumstances. Further work can explore whether a minimal set of barriers needs to be addressed to improve physician certification or a more holistic approach is needed (e.g., addressing the \u201cemotionally charged\u201d issues as well).\nAs there are various language proficiency tests available, health systems should consider whether a given test has been validated and serves their needs; and then report\nproficiency in a standardized way to ensure consistency and provide guidance to physicians and patients. While targeted interventions may increase assessment participation and overcome some barriers, health systems may also need new forms of assessment. One promising alternative is to use direct observation of language skills during a clinical visit to certify bilingual physicians. Direct observation could potentially overcome some of the inherent difficulties of current testing identified by our participants (i.e., challenging test format and structure, time constraints, and competing demands). However, it will be important to use a validated tool for direct observation to ensure its use in clinical settings is accurately assessing language proficiency; such a tool has been developed and tested for reliability by members of our team and is currently being validated.36\n3104\nGarcia et al.: Physician Non-English Language Proficiency Assessment ImplementationJGIM\nOur study has limitations. It was conducted in one academic, outpatient clinical setting with good access to interpreter services, which may have affected the physicians\u2019 calculus to test versus use professional interpreters. Furthermore, while our site used the CCLA, other tests are available, and no gold standard exists. Therefore, the perceptions of test characteristics in our sample may not be generalizable to other assessments. However, the CCLA is widely used, and participant experiences described in this study may further inform a health systems\u2019 choice of test, decision to adopt the CCLA, or to incorporate alternative forms of assessment such as direct observation of clinical language proficiency when an assessment tool is validated and available. Finally, our study only included general internists; other barriers may exist for physicians in other specialties and settings or for other health professionals.\nBarriers and facilitators to testing non-English-language proficiency are complex. Some are procedural, yet many more relate to individual motivation and social and environmental context. These will require targeted multi-component interventions or changes to current assessment practices. To ensure adequate language access for patients with LEP, in addition to making professional interpreters more widely available and encouraging their use, health systems will need to ensure quality language concordant care.\nAbbreviations CCLA: Clinician Cultural and Linguistic Assessment; ILR: Interagency Language Reporting Scale; LEP: Limited English Proficiency; LASI: Language Access System Improvement Study\nSupplementary Information The online version contains supplementary material available at https:// doi. org/ 10. 1007/ s11606- 023- 08354-6.\nCorresponding Author: Maria Esteli Garcia, MD, MPH, MAS; Division of General Internal Medicine, Department of Medicine, Multiethnic Health Equity Research Center, University of California, 1701 Divisadero St. Room 536, San Francisco, CA, 94143-1731, USA (e-mail: maria.garcia@ucsf.edu).\nAuthor Contribution Study conception and design by LSK, SM, and LD.
