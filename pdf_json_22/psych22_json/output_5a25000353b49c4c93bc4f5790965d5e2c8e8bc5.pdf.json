    "abstractText": "Background Many studies have highlighted the clinical relevance of food addiction (FA) by showing its association with psychopathological severity and even more when co-occurring with binge eating disorder. It was suggested that the association between FA and greater psychopathological severity could be accounted for by a history of traumatic experiences. The present study examined the relationship between childhood trauma (including peer victimization, abuse, and neglect) and maladaptive eating behaviors (FA, binge eating, and grazing) and explored whether childhood trauma predicts FA when controlling for binge eating, grazing, and other confounding variables. Methods One hundred fourteen adult women seeking psychological help for problems related to eating or weight completed questionnaires measuring FA, binge eating, grazing, depressive symptoms, peer victimization, and childhood abuse and neglect.",

            "text": "In the last two decades, many neuroimaging and experimental studies using animal models have suggested that addictive processes may be involved in the overconsumption of highly palatable food (i.e., processed calorie-dense foods) [1-2]. These studies rapidly led to the concept of food addiction (FA), which has been operationalized by adapting the diagnostic criteria for substance-related and addictive disorders (SRAD) of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) [3]. Since then, the Yale Food Addiction Scale has been the measure of choice to assess FA [4-5]. Although FA is not a psychiatric disorder included in the DSM-5, many studies have highlighted its clinical relevance by showing that it was associated with higher BMI and greater psychopathological severity (e.g., higher psychiatric comorbidities, cravings, shape and weight concerns, and psychological distress) and, even more importantly, when co-occurring with binge eating disorder (BED) [6-10]. To account for these findings, Davis proposed that FA might be the most severe form of BED [8]. Reviewing many neurobiological, psychological, and behavioral pieces of evidence, she proposed an (over)eating continuum that presents a dimensional view based on eating severity, degree of compulsiveness, and level of impairment. That continuum starts with homeostatic eating, then passive forms of overeating, and then different forms of loss-of-control eating (i.e., binge eating episodes, BED, and finally FA at the very end of the continuum).\nThe association between FA and greater psychopathological severity could also be accounted for by more frequent traumatic experiences in the past [11]. The association with childhood cumulative trauma (i.e., an accumulation of several interpersonal trauma during childhood) is well documented, but the associations\nHow to cite this article Legendre M, Sabourin S, B\u00e9gin C (July 18, 2022) Maladaptive Eating Behaviors and Childhood Trauma: A Focus on Food Addiction. Cureus 14(7): e26966. DOI 10.7759/cureus.26966\nwith specific types of trauma are inconsistent across studies. A preliminary study involving 57,321 women registered nurses showed that physical and sexual abuse were associated with a higher risk of FA [12]. A second study demonstrated, with a sample of 49,408 women, that FA prevalence was twice as high in a severe posttraumatic stress disorder group (6-7 symptoms) compared to a group without trauma history [13]. Recently, a study involving 73 women showed higher childhood cumulative trauma as well as higher physical abuse, emotional abuse, and emotional neglect scores for the FA group than for the no FA group. However, in this study, no differences were found in sexual abuse and physical neglect [14]. Finally, similar results were obtained with bariatric candidates while elevated adverse childhood experience scores were associated with an increased likelihood of FA diagnosis and greater FA severity [15]. To our knowledge, only one study did not find higher childhood cumulative trauma for the FA group compared to the control group [16]. However, the control group from this study showed a sexual abuse score much higher than the cut-off score recommended by Bernstein and Fink [17], suggesting that this group had a more severe trauma history than what would be expected from a control group.\nOnly one study investigated the association between both FA and binge eating (using the Binge Eating Scale) and childhood trauma [18]. In this study, it was demonstrated that FA and binge eating were positively associated with childhood cumulative trauma, physical abuse, emotional abuse, physical neglect, and emotional neglect but not sexual abuse. Second, childhood cumulative trauma was a significant predictor of FA when controlling for potential confounding variables, including binge eating. Finally, it was demonstrated that the group with co-occurring FA and binge eating had higher childhood cumulative trauma and emotional abuse than groups with FA or binge eating alone and higher physical abuse, physical neglect, and emotional neglect compared to the control group (without FA or binge eating). However, for sexual abuse, no difference was found between groups. The absence of a group difference for sexual abuse as well as the absence of a positive relation between FA and sexual abuse was unexpected, considering previous findings [12]. According to the authors, these unexpected results could be explained by the low rate of sexual abuse experiences reported by their sample [18].\nThe association between childhood trauma and FA is increasingly evident, but some inconsistencies between specific types of traumas need to be clarified. Moreover, other maladaptive eating behaviors that may be associated with experiences of childhood trauma and FA have been overlooked. Grazing, which is an unstructured, repetitive eating of small amounts of food over a longer time period [19-22], has been suggested to better represent eating behaviors associated with obesity and FA than binge eating [23-24]. However, no study has investigated the association between grazing and childhood trauma, and only one study investigated the association between FA and grazing. This study reported that grazing was a good predictor of FA symptoms [25]. Finally, other types of childhood interpersonal traumas had not been considered. Above all, peer victimization (e.g., teasing, bullying, pushing, and social exclusion) could be associated with FA. Peer victimization is pernicious in its repetitive nature and has been demonstrated to be an important contributor to many psychological problems [26]. In particular, peer victimization has been repeatedly associated with eating disorders [27-30].\nThe main objective of this study was to examine the relationship between childhood trauma (including peer victimization and abuse and neglect) and maladaptive eating behaviors (FA, binge eating, and grazing). A second objective was to examine whether childhood trauma predicts FA when controlling for binge eating, grazing, and other confounding variables. It was hypothesized that all types of childhood traumas will be positively associated with all maladaptive eating behaviors, but in accordance with the assumption that FA is the more severe form of overeating [8], stronger associations between childhood trauma and FA were expected. Moreover, it was hypothesized that childhood trauma will explain a significant portion of FA variance even when controlling for binge eating, grazing, and other confounding variables."

The first section measures victimization behaviors committed, and the second section measures victimization behaviors experienced as a victim. Within each section, the three types of victimization behaviors (verbal, physical, and social) are assessed with six items on a six-point Likert scale\n2022 Legendre et al. Cureus 14(7): e26966.

For this study, only the second section (being victimized) was used, and three items (one for each type of peer victimization) specifically targeting peer victimization related to weight were added. Therefore, the severity score for each type of peer victimization (verbal, physical, and social) ranges from 7 to 42, and the total score varies from 21 to 126 for global peer victimization. As there was no French version, the APRI was translated using a forward-backward method. The scale was translated from English to French by a bilingual graduate student and then translated from French to English by another bilingual graduate student. Both students and a third independent scholar discussed the final translation until agreement on item formulation was reached. In addition, as the questionnaire assesses peer victimization behaviors committed in the past year at school, the instructions have been adapted for adults to reflect peer victimization behaviors experienced during childhood in general. In the present study, internal consistency was adequate, with Cronbach's alpha ranging from .81 to .96 for the total score and subscales for each type of peer victimization."

Specifically, for sexual abuse, items aim to describe the abuse according to the relationship with the aggressor (e.g., parent, brother, uncle), type of sexual abuse (e.g., touching, sexual intercourse), and the frequency (total of abuse(s) during childhood). A severity score from 0 to 11 can be computed according to those three items. To cover physical and psychological abuse and neglect, 13 items on a seven-point Likert Scale ranging from 0 (never) to 6 (every day or almost) are used. The severity score ranges from 0 to 30 for physical abuse, from 0 to 18 for psychological abuse, from 0 to 12 for physical neglect, and from 0 to 18 for psychological neglect.

First, a Pearson correlation matrix was made with age, BMI, depressive symptoms (BDI), maladaptive eating (YFAS 2.0, BES, and GQ), and childhood trauma (APRI and CCTQ). Second, a twostep hierarchical multiple regression was constructed to predict FA. In the first step, all variables showing a significant correlation with FA were included.

In the second step, abuse and neglect and peer victimization explained 7% more FA variance. Abuse and neglect and peer victimization both showed a significant unique contribution to the explanation of FA variance but binge eating was still the most important predictor.\n2022 Legendre et al.

            "text": "The main purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between childhood trauma and maladaptive eating behaviors using a sample of 114 adult women with overweight or obesity who consult for weight and eating difficulties. As hypothesized, significant small to moderate correlations were found between all types of childhood traumas and FA, except for one relation (physical neglect). Regarding binge eating, some correlations with different types of childhood traumas were significant but smaller as compared to FA (except for sexual abuse). With the exception of sexual abuse and physical neglect, the correlation coefficients between childhood traumas and FA were above .30, while the correlation coefficients with binge eating were below .30. In their study, Imperatori et al. also reported stronger associations between childhood trauma and FA than with binge eating [18]. Globally, these results are consistent with previous findings regarding the association between childhood trauma and FA [12,14-15,18] or BED [27-30,40-42]. Grazing and BMI showed no significant correlation with any measure of childhood trauma. BMI has been frequently associated with different types of traumas [43-45] but with a small effect (odds ratio from 1.13 to 1.50). Consistent with these meta-analyses, BMI showed small correlations with some types of traumas, without being significant, probably due to a lack of statistical power. It is possible that the relationship between childhood trauma and BMI may be mostly explained by maladaptive eating behaviors, as weight gain is a frequent consequence of those behaviors. Regarding grazing, to our knowledge, no study has examined the association between grazing and childhood trauma. Considering previous findings suggesting that grazing is a common maladaptive eating behavior associated with FA [20,24-25], we hypothesized that grazing is associated with childhood trauma, but no significant correlation was found. This unexpected result may suggest that grazing is a form of maladaptive eating that is less compulsive than binge eating and FA and, therefore, not specific to people with a trauma history. While the frequency of compulsive grazing is unknown in the general population, a study assessing the frequency of nibbling found that 40% of university students with healthy weight reported nibbling more than half the days in a whole month [46]. In comparison, the prevalence of BED is approximately 1-2% [3], and the prevalence of FA is between 0% and 26% in the general population [47].\nA second objective of the study was to examine whether childhood trauma predicts FA when controlling for other maladaptive eating behaviors and confounding variables. As hypothesized, childhood trauma significantly explained FA variance. Previously, Imperatori et al. built a hierarchical regression model to predict FA and found that binge eating, childhood trauma, BMI, and other confounding variables explain 55% of FA variance [18]. However, because childhood trauma was entered in the first step of their hierarchical regression, it is impossible to know the variance (i.e., R2 change) associated with the inclusion of childhood trauma. Of all predictors, binge eating, childhood trauma, and BMI were those with a\n2022 Legendre et al. Cureus 14(7): e26966. DOI 10.7759/cureus.26966 7 of 10\nsignificant unique contribution. They reported standardized coefficients of 0.66 for binge eating and 0.12 for childhood trauma, which is roughly similar to those we obtained (i.e., 0.58 for binge eating, 0.19 for peer victimization, and 0.15 for abuse and neglect). The present results replicated their findings and established a significant contribution of approximately 7% of childhood trauma in the explanation of FA.\nDavis proposed an (over)eating continuum that presents a dimensional view of overeating based on severity, degree of compulsiveness, and level of impairment [8]. By referring to the experienced trauma as a marker of severity, our results can support the hypothesis of a continuum of compulsive eating behaviors. In our study, grazing was not discriminant enough to identify people with trauma history and could be placed toward the beginning of the continuum. Because FA showed the strongest associations with trauma history, it might be the best marker of severity and should be placed at the very end of the continuum. Binge eating was less correlated with trauma history than FA but still showed some positive correlations with different types of traumas and should be placed between grazing and FA.\nA broad body of literature supports the deleterious long-term effects of peer victimization. For instance, two important reviews defend that peer victimization in childhood and adolescence is a major risk factor for impaired functioning and poor physical and mental health in adults [48-49]. Even though peer victimization behaviors appear less intrusive and severe than sexual and physical abuse, they still represent interpersonal aggression that may be destructive by its repetitive nature. To date, peer victimization has not been considered in studies on childhood trauma and FA. In our study, the association found between peer victimization and FA (r from .30 and .34) suggests that it is likely a contributor as important as other types of traumas.\nThe current study has limitations to consider. First, BMI was not reported for a significant proportion of participants and could not be included in the hierarchical regression. The absence of a significant correlation between BMI and any measure of childhood trauma may also be a consequence of the high proportion of missing data for BMI. Therefore, results regarding BMI may be interpreted with caution. Second, a selfreport scale was used to assess binge eating. This choice was made because a binge eating severity score was necessary for correlations, and BED diagnosis (i.e., a dichotomous variable) would not fit its purpose. Therefore, it is important to distinguish the BED diagnosis from the binge eating severity score used in this study. Finally, this study was only composed of Caucasian women. This choice was made to increase the homogeneity of the sample and the internal validity. Therefore, our results cannot be generalized to males or people with different racial backgrounds. Nevertheless, this study is coherent with the overrepresentation of women in eating disorders and obesity management services. Additionally, the clinical sample in this study makes it impossible to generalize the results to the general population."

            "text": "To shed light on the clinical relevance of FA, this study further explored the relation between FA and childhood trauma. Both peer victimization and abuse and neglect showed significant positive correlations with FA and unique contribution to the explanation of FA when controlling for binge eating, grazing, depressive symptoms, and age. These findings provide a potential explanation for the association of FA with greater clinical severity. From a clinical perspective, we argue that FA provides an accurate and quick assessment of psychopathological severity and represents an essential complement to the evaluation of eating disorders related to overweight. The psychopathological severity associated with FA may be the result of biological embedding, which would require long-term treatment. The next step should be to test the impact of childhood trauma on treatment outcomes with participants endorsing FA.\nAdditional Information"
