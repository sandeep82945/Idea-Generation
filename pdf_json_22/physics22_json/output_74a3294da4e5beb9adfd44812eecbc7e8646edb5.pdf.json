    "abstractText": "We prove the existence of periodic travelling wave solutions for general discrete nonlinear KleinGordon systems, considering both cases of hard and soft on-site potentials. In the case of hard on-site potentials we implement a fixed point theory approach, combining Schauder\u2019s fixed point theorem and the contraction mapping principle. This approach enables us to identify a ring in the energy space for non-trivial solutions to exist, energy (norm) thresholds for their existence and upper bounds on their velocity. In the case of soft on-site potentials, the proof of existence of periodic travelling wave solutions is facilitated by a variational approach based on the Mountain Pass Theorem. Thresholds on the averaged kinetic energy for these solutions to exist are also derived.",

INTRODUCTION\nTravelling wave solutions (TWSs) in lattice dynamical systems have attracted considerable interest due to their fundamental importance in numerous physical contexts such as the energy transfer in biomolecules, the mobility of dislocations in crystalline materials and the propagation of pulses in optical systems, to name a few [1]-[5]. A variety of fundamental models for the description of such phenomena has been studied, including Fermi-Pasta-UlamTsingou, discrete nonlinear Klein-Gordon (DKG) and discrete nonlinear Schro\u0308dinger (DNLS) models [1]-[31], as well as, spatially discrete reaction diffusion systems [32]-[39] which are relevant to pattern formation resulting from phase transitions. Discrete systems are appropriate when the scale of decompositions are too small to be effectively described by continuous approximations.\nThe existence of solitary travelling wave solutions has been rigorously treated with various approaches from nonlinear analysis [40]-[43], based on direct and minimax variational methods [6]\u2013[15], reduction to finite dimensional manifolds and normal form techniques [16],[17] and fixed-point methods[18]-[22]. For a presentation of several functional-analytic methods and corresponding background for their implementation in nonlinear lattices we refer to the monograph [23].\nOn the other hand, the problem of the existence of periodic TWSs is much less explored, in particular for second order in time lattice dynamical systems, such as DKG lattices. In the present work, by combining a fixed-point approach and variational methods, we study the existence of periodic TWSs for general DKG systems with anharmonic on-site potentials in one-dimensional lattices.\nIn particular, we study general DKG systems described by the following set of coupled oscillator equations\nd2qn dt2 = \u03ba(qn+1 \u2212 2qn + qn\u22121)\u2212 V \u2032(qn). (1.1)\nThe prime \u2032 stands for the derivative with respect to qn, the latter being the coordinate of the oscillator at site n evolving in an anharmonic on-site potential V (qn). Each oscillator interacts with its neighbours to the left and right and the strength of the interaction is regulated by the value of the parameter \u03ba. This system has a Hamiltonian structure related to the energy\nH = \u2211 n ( 1 2 p2n + V (qn) + \u03ba 2 (qn+1 \u2212 qn)2 ) , (1.2)\nand it is time-reversible with respect to the involution p 7\u2192 \u2212p. In the case of a finite lattice, the system (1.1) describes the dynamics of an arbitrary number of N + 1 oscillators, which are placed equidistantly on the interval I = (\u2212L,L)\n\u2217 Corresponding author.

The quantity \u03ba = 1/2h2 serves as the discretisation parameter, with h = 2L/N defining the lattice spacing. The position of the oscillators is given by the discrete spatial coordinate\nxn = \u2212L+ nh, n = 0, 1, 2, . . . , N. (1.3)\nFor finite lattices (1.1) we impose periodic boundary conditions\nqn = qn+N . (1.4)\nWe consider TWSs of the form:\nqn(t) = Q (n\u2212 c t) = Q(z), (1.5)\nwith a 2L\u2212periodic function Q(z), z = n \u2212 c t, where c \u2208 R \\ {0} is the velocity. The solutions (1.5) satisfy the advance-delay equation\nc2Q\u2032\u2032(z) = \u03ba(Q(z + 1)\u2212 2Q(z) +Q(z \u2212 1))\u2212 V \u2032(Q(z)). (1.6)\nAs the system (1.1) possesses the time-reversibility symmetry it suffices to consider c > 0. The presentation of the results is as follows: Section II deals with the existence of periodic TWSs in finite lattices with hard on-site potentials. Imposing periodic boundary conditions, the existence of periodic TWSs is proved by a fixed-point approach, based on Schauder\u2019s fixed point theorem and contraction mapping principles. The Schauder\u2019s fixed point method was made use of in our recent works [25], [26] in order to establish the existence of breather solutions. To our knowledge, the extension of this approach to the problem of the existence of TWs is novel, and as in the case of breathers, can offer a comparatively concise method (if compared to the aforementioned ones), for treating the advance-delay equation (1.6) in the suitable functional set-up of Sobolev spaces of periodic functions. The combination with the contraction mapping argument yields the identification of a ring in the energy space where nontrivial solutions exist, together with the derivation of energy thresholds for their existence, and an upper bound for their velocity. For the latter, the contraction mapping argument is applied on a map defined by a suitable auxiliary linear, non-homogeneous problem stemming from (1.6), whose solvability is guaranteed by the Friedrichs extension theorem. We should remark that while the current literature on the energy threshold problem concerns mainly breather solutions for DNLS models [27],[28] (see also [20],[21],[22],[29] and references therein), to the best of our knowledge, the results of the present work are the first on energy thresholds for TWSs.\nIn section III we consider the case of soft on-site potentials. This time, for the proof of existence of non-trivial periodic TWSs, we implement a variational approach based on the Mountain Pass Theorem. Still in this case, threshold values for the average kinetic energy of TWSs are derived with the aid of the contraction mapping principle.\nIn both cases of potentials, the estimates on the norms of the solutions and the various thresholds are derived under certain conditions exhibiting a coherent dependence on the lattice parameters, the frequency of the TWs and their velocity which is proved to be physically relevant (e.g. see the concluding remarks of section II for the case of the hard potentials).\nII. HARD ON-SITE POTENTIALS\nIn this section we consider hard on-site (uniformly convex) potentials V (x) assuming that the following assumption holds on them:\nA: V : R \u2192 R is non-negative and at least twice continuously differentiable and is characterised by the following properties:\nV (0) = V \u2032(0) = 0, V \u2032\u2032(0) > 0, (2.1)\nV (x) = V (\u2212x), for all x \u2208 R, (2.2)\nThe unique equilibrium at x = 0 is a global minimum of V (x). Further, we assume that V satisfies for some positive constants m \u03b1, \u03b2, and K, the conditions\n|V \u2032\u2032(x)| \u2264 m|x|\u03b1, \u2200x \u2208 R, (2.3) |V \u2032(x1)\u2212 V \u2032(x2)| \u2264 K(|x1|\u03b2 + |x2|\u03b2)|x1 \u2212 x2|. (2.4)\n3 We consider periodic solutions Q(z) = Q(z + 2L) of zero-mean satisfying\u222b L \u2212L Q(z)dz = \u222b L \u2212L V \u2032(Q(z))dz = 0, (2.5)\nwhich is satisfied for even potentials (2.2) and periodic functions exhibiting the symmetry\nQ(z \u2212 L/2) = \u2212Q(L/2\u2212 z). (2.6)\nWe shall further discuss the conditions (2.2), (2.5) and (2.6) of the assumption A below (see Theorem II.2). Under assumption A, we reformulate the original problem (1.6) as a fixed point problem for a suitably defined operator in a Banach space. Motivated by our recent works [25],[26] applying Schauder\u2019s Fixed Point Theorem [42] to prove the existence of breathers in discrete nonlinear KG lattices, we show that the same Theorem is applicable, in order to prove the existence of periodic travelling waves.\nIn particular, we will use the following version of Schauder\u2019s Fixed Point Theorem (see e.g. in [42]):\nTheorem II.1. Let G be a non-empty closed convex subset of the Banach space X. Suppose that U : G \u2192 G is a continuous and compact map. then U has a fixed point in G.\nA. Existence of periodic TWSs\nWe start by introducing appropriate function spaces on which our methods will be employed. We consider first the space\nX0 = { Q \u2208 L2per(\u2212L,L) | \u222b L \u2212L Q(s)ds = \u222b L \u2212L V \u2032(Q(s))ds = 0, Q(s\u2212 L/2) = \u2212Q(L/2\u2212 s) } , (2.7)\nthat is, the space of L2per(\u2212L,L), 2L\u2212periodic, square integrable functions of zero mean, on the account of conditions (2.2), (2.5) and (2.6). The space X0 is endowed with the norm,\n||Q||X0 =\n( 1\n2L \u222b L \u2212L Q(s)2ds )1/2 =  \u2211 k\u2208Z\\{0} |Q\u0302k|2dk 1/2 . (2.8) Q\u0302k determines the Fourier-coefficient in the Fourier series expansion:\nQ(s) = \u2211\nk\u2208Z\\{0}\nQ\u0302k exp (i\u2126ks) , s \u2208 (\u2212L,L), \u2126 = \u03c0\nL , (2.9)\nQ\u0302k = 1\n2L \u222b L \u2212L Q(s) exp(\u2212i\u2126ks)ds, Q\u0302k = Q\u0302\u2212k, (2.10)\nof Q(s) and x denotes the complex conjugate of x. Evidently, X0 is a closed subspace of L2per(\u2212L,L). We shall also use the spaces\nX1 = { Q \u2208 H1per(\u2212L,L) | \u222b L \u2212L Q(s)ds = \u222b L \u2212L V \u2032(Q(s))ds = 0, Q(s\u2212 L/2) = \u2212Q(L/2\u2212 s) } , (2.11)\nendowed with the scalar product and induced norm\n(U,Q)X1 = \u222b L \u2212L U \u2032(s)Q\u2032(s)ds, ||Q||2X1 = \u222b L \u2212L Q\u2032(s)2ds = \u2211\nk\u2208Z\\{0}\n(k\u2126)2|Q\u0302k|2. (2.12)\nIt can be easily checked that the Poincare\u0301 inequality\u222b L \u2212L Q(s)2ds \u2264 C(L) \u222b L \u2212L Q\u2032(s)2ds, (2.13)\n4 holds with the optimal constant C(L) = L2/\u03c02 when the Hilbert space X1 is used. Note that the validity of the Poincare\u0301 inequality (2.13) allows for the usage of the homogeneous norm (2.12). Of use will also be the space\nX2 = { Q \u2208 H2per(\u2212L,L) | \u222b L \u2212L Q(s)ds = \u222b L \u2212L V \u2032(Q(s))ds = 0, Q(s\u2212 L/2) = \u2212Q(L/2\u2212 s) } . (2.14)\nDue to the Poincare\u0301 inequality (2.13), for X2 we shall use the homogeneous norm\n||Q||2X2 = \u222b L \u2212L Q\u2032\u2032(s)2ds = \u2211\nk\u2208Z\\{0}\n(k\u2126)4|Q\u0302k|2. (2.15)\nIt can be readily seen that X2 is a closed subspace of H2per(\u2212L,L). Furthermore, X2 is compactly embedded in X0 (X2 \u22d0 X0).\nIn some cases, we will facilitate variational methods. In particular, solutions of (1.6) will be considered as critical points of the action functional S : X1 \u2192 R given by\nS(Q) = \u222b L \u2212L [ 1 2 (cQ\u2032(z)) 2 \u2212 V (Q(z))\u2212 1 2 \u03ba [Q(z + 1)\u2212Q(z)]2 ] dz.\nRelated with the action functional is the (total) energy functional E on X1:\nE(Q) = \u222b L \u2212L [ 1 2 (cQ\u2032(z)) 2 + V (Q(z)) + \u03ba 2 [Q(z + 1)\u2212Q(z)]2 ] dz, (2.16)\nwhich will be also involved in the derivation of several bounds for the solutions. Let us denote by C0,\u2217 the constant of the embedding X2 \u22d0 X0, and by C2,\u2217 the constant of the embedding X2 \u2282 L\u221e([\u2212L,L]). We now proceed to the statement and proof of the result on the existence of periodic TWSs:\nTheorem II.2. Let assumption A hold. If\n4\u03ba c2 < \u21262, (2.17)\nthen there exists a periodic TWS qn(t) = Q (n\u2212 ct) \u2261 Q(z) of (1.1) with Q \u2208 H2(\u2212L,L) and\n||Q||X0 \u2264 ( c2\u21262 \u2212 4\u03ba KC\u03b23,\u2217 )1/\u03b2 := Rmax, (2.18)\nwhere the constant C3,\u2217 is given by\nC3,\u2217 := C2,\u2217 C0,\u2217 , (2.19)\nsuch that\nQ(z + 2L) = Q(z), \u2200z \u2208 R. (2.20)\nProof: We seek 2L\u2212periodic functions Q \u2208 H2(\u2212L,L) satisfying (2.5-(2.6) and solve Eq. (1.6). For the following discussions it is suitable to re-write Eq. (1.6) as:\nQ\u2032\u2032(z)\u2212 \u03ba c2 (Q(z + 1)\u2212 2Q(z) +Q(z \u2212 1)) = \u2212 1 c2 V \u2032(Q(z)). (2.21)\nThus only the right-hand side of (2.21) features terms nonlinear in Q. Ultimately, (2.21) shall be expressed as a fixed point equation in Q. To proceed, we recall first some basic facts for the intersection of Banach spaces [44, Lemma 2.3.1 and Theorem 2.7.1]: For two Banach spaces X and Y , the intersection X \u2229 Y is a Banach space endowed with the norm\n||x||X\u2229Y = ||x||X + ||x||Y , for all x \u2208 X \u2229 Y . (2.22)\n5 Clearly, from (2.22), we have that\n||x||X \u2264 ||x||X\u2229Y , and ||x||Y \u2264 ||x||X\u2229Y , for all x \u2208 X \u2229 Y . (2.23)\nMoreover, in the particular case where Y is continuously embedded in X with an embedding constant c0, that is ||x||x \u2264 c0||x||Y , for all x \u2208 Y , then, due to (2.22) and (2.23),\n||x||X \u2264 ||x||X\u2229Y \u2264 c\u22170||x||Y , for all x \u2208 Y , c\u22170 = 1 + c0. (2.24)\nHence, if x is in a closed ball of Y of radius r, then due to (2.24), x is in the closed ball of X \u2229 Y of radius c\u22170r, and in the closed ball of the same radius of X. With these preparations we apply the above for X = X0 and Y = X2, and we define a convex set of X0 \u2229 X2, as follows: First, we consider arbitrary elements P \u2208 X0 \u2229 X2, such that\n||P ||X2 \u2264 \u03f1. (2.25)\nSince P \u2208 X2 \u2229 X0 and X2 \u22d0 X0 with compact embedding, it holds by application of (2.24), that\n||P ||X0 \u2264 ||P ||X0\u2229X2 \u2264 C0,\u2217||P ||X2 \u2264 C0,\u2217\u03f1, (2.26)\nThen, we set for simplicity,\nR = C0,\u2217\u03f1, (2.27)\nand we consider the convex set of X0 \u2229 X2 as\nY0 = {P \u2208 X0 \u2229 X2 : ||P ||X0 \u2264 R } . (2.28)\nEvidentially, the set Y0 is well defined and non-empty due to (2.25) and (2.26). As we will prove below, R (and thus, \u03f1, due to (2.27)), will be explicitly determined, giving rise to the estimate (2.18) for the TWs. We relate the left-hand side of (2.21) to the linear mapping: M : X2 \u2192 X0:\nM(P ) = P \u2032\u2032(z)\u2212 \u03ba c2 (P (z + 1)\u2212 2P (z) + P (z \u2212 1)). (2.29)\nAs a next step, we establish the invertibility of this mapping and derive an upper bound for the norm of its inverse. Applying the operator M to the Fourier elements exp(i\u2126ks) in (2.9), results in\nM exp(i\u2126ks) = \u03bdk exp(i\u2126ks), (2.30)\nwhere\n\u03bdk = \u2212\u21262 k2 + 4 \u03ba\nc2 sin2\n( \u2126\n2 k\n) . (2.31)\nThe hypothesis (2.17) guarantees that \u03bdk \u0338= 0, for all k \u2208 Z \\ {0}. Therefore, the mapping M possesses an inverse obeyingM\u22121 exp(i\u2126ks) = (1/\u03bdk) exp(i\u2126ks). For the norm of the linear operatorM\n\u22121 : X0 \u2192 X2, one gets, by using the hypothesis (2.17), the upper bound:\n||M\u22121||X0,X2 = sup 0\u0338=Q\u2208X0 ||M\u22121Q||X2 ||Q||X0\n= sup 0\u0338=Q\u2208X0\n(\u2211\u2032 l(\u2126 l) 4 \u2223\u2223\u2223 1\u03bdl Q\u0302l exp(i l\u2126s)\u2223\u2223\u22232)1/2\n||Q||X0\n\u2264 sup l\u2208Z\\{0}\n\u221a (\u2126 l)4\n|\u03bdl| \u00b7 sup 0\u0338=Q\u2208X0\n(\u2211\u2032 l |Q\u0302l|2 )1/2 ||Q||X0\n= sup l\u2208Z\\{0}\n(\u2126 l)2 | \u2212 \u21262 l2 + 4\u03bac2 sin 2 ( \u2126 2 l ) |\n\u2264 \u2126 2\n\u21262 \u2212 4\u03bac2 , (2.32)\n6 which verifies the boundedness of M\u22121; note that we have used the notation \u2211\u2032 l = \u2211 l\u2208Z\\{0}. Obviously, the same estimate (2.32) verifies the boundedness of M\u22121 as an operator M\u22121 : X2 \u2229 X0 \u2192 X0 On the other hand, we remark for later use, that if we consider only the lower-order terms of the estimate (2.32), we get that\n||M\u22121||X0,X0 \u2264 c2\nc2\u21262 \u2212 4\u03ba . (2.33)\nAssociated with the right-hand side of (2.21) we introduce the nonlinear operator N : Y0 \u2192 Y0, as\nN(P ) = \u2212 1 c2 V \u2032(P ). (2.34)\nFrom the definition of the operator N in (2.34), the necessity for the conditions (2.2),(2.5) and (2.6) becomes evident, as they guarantee the closeness of the operator N in Y0. To verify continuity of the operator N on X0, for any P \u2208 Y0, (which implies by the definition of Y0 that P \u2208 X0 \u2229 X2), we prove that N is Frechet differentiable with a locally bounded derivative. Using (2.3) we have\nN \u2032(P ) : h \u2208 X0 7\u2192 N \u2032(P )[h] = \u2212 1\nc2 V \u2032\u2032(P )h \u2208 X0. (2.35)\nThen, since P \u2208 X2 \u2229 X0 and X2 \u2282 L\u221e([\u2212L,L]) with continuous embedding, we have that\n||N \u2032(P )[h]||X0 = || \u2212 1\nc2 V \u2032\u2032(P )h||X0\n= 1\nc2\n( 1\n2L \u222b L \u2212L |V \u2032\u2032(P (z))h(z)|2dz )1/2 \u2264 1 c2 ( m2 max \u2212L\u2264z\u2264L |P (z)|2\u03b1 1 2L \u222b L \u2212L |h(z)|2dz )1/2 \u2264 m\nc2 max \u2212L\u2264z\u2264L |P (z)|\u03b1 ||h||X0\n\u2264 m c2 C\u03b12,\u2217||P ||\u03b1X2 ||h||X0 \u2264 A(m, c 2, C2,\u2217, \u03f1)||h||X0 , (2.36)\nfor the constant\nA = A(m, c2, C2,\u2217, \u03f1) = m\nc2 C\u03b12,\u2217\u03f1 \u03b1,\nproving the local boundedness of the differential. Then, one concludes that the Frechet derivative is locally bounded as\n||N \u2032(P )||L(X0,X0) \u2264 A. (2.37)\nWith the aid of the locally bounded derivative, we can prove the local Lipschitz continuity of N as follows:\n||N(P )\u2212N(Q)||X0 \u2264 sup S\u2208[P,Q] ||N \u2032(S)||L(X0,X0)||P \u2212Q||X0\n\u2264 A||P \u2212Q||X0 . (2.38)\nAs the range of N is concerned, by using condition (2.4), we derive that for any P \u2208 Y0,\n||N(P )||X0 = 1\nc2 || \u2212 V \u2032(P ) ||X0 =\n1\nc2\n( 1\n2L \u222b L \u2212L | \u2212 V \u2032(P (z))|2du )1/2 \u2264 1 c2 ( 1 2L \u222b L \u2212L K2|P (z)|2(\u03b2+1)dz )1/2 \u2264 K\nc2 max \u2212L\u2264z\u2264L |P (z)|\u03b2 ||P ||X0\n\u2264 K c2 C\u03b22,\u2217||P || \u03b2 X2 ||P ||X0 \u2264 K c2 C\u03b22,\u2217C0,\u2217||P || \u03b2+1 X2\n\u2264 K c2 C\u03b22,\u2217C0,\u2217\u03f1 \u03b2+1 = K c2 ( C2,\u2217 C0,\u2217 )\u03b2 R\u03b2+1. (2.39)\n7 Thus, we proved in (2.39), that for any P \u2208 Y0,\n||N(P )||X0 \u2264 KC\u03b23,\u2217 c2 R\u03b2+1, (2.40)\nwith the constant C3,\u2217 = C2,\u2217 C0,\u2217 , as defined in (2.19).\nAt last, we express the problem (2.21) as a fixed point equation in terms of a mapping Y0 \u2192 Y0:\nQ =M\u22121 \u25e6N(Q) \u2261 L (Q). (2.41)\nUsing (2.33) and (2.39), we have\n||L (Q)||X0 = ||M\u22121(N(Q))||X0 \u2264 ||M\u22121||X0,X0 ||N(Q)||X0\n\u2264 KC\u03b23,\u2217\nc2\u21262 \u2212 4\u03ba R\u03b2+1 \u2264 R, (2.42)\nassuring by assumptions (2.17) and (2.18), that indeed,\nL (Y0) \u2286 Y0. (2.43)\nFurthermore, since it holds that L (Q) \u2208 X2 for all Q \u2208 Y0 \u2286 X0, one has L (Y0) \u2286 X2 \u2229 Y0, and as the embedding of X2 in X0 is compact, the operator L is compact. It remains to prove that L is continuous on Y0: For arbitrary P1, P2 \u2208 Y0, we have\n||L (P1)\u2212 L (P2)||X0 = ||M\u22121(N(P1))\u2212M\u22121(N(P2))||X2 \u2264 ||M\u22121||X0,X0 ||N(P1)\u2212N(P2)||X0\n\u2264 Ac 2\nc2\u21262 \u2212 4\u03ba ||P1 \u2212 P2||X0 < \u03f5, (2.44)\nif\n||P1 \u2212 P2||X0 < \u03b4 = c2\u21262 \u2212 4\u03ba\nAc2 \u03f5, (2.45)\nfor any given \u03f5 > 0, verifying that L (Q) is continuous on Y0. Thus, all the assumptions of Schauder\u2019s fixed point theorem are satisfied, and hence, the fixed point equation Q = L (Q) has at least one solution. \u25a1\nRemark II.1. (Regularity of travelling waves). By the Sobolev embeddings, the obtained H2-travelling wave solutions Q are C1. Therefore, due to Eq. (1.6) it holds that Q\u2032\u2032 \u2208 C1 and conclusively Q \u2208 C3, that is, they are classical solutions.\nB. Existence of non-trivial TWSs and an energy threshold\nIn this section, we consider the problem of existence and non-existence of non-trivial TWSs with frequencies satisfying the strengthened condition\n\u21262 > 4\u03ba+KC\u03b23,\u2217\nc2 , (2.46)\nif compared to (2.17). The motivation for assuming (2.46), is explained in Theorem II.3 concluding the section. We start by stating a result on non-existence of non-trivial TWSs with frequencies satisfying (2.46).\nProposition II.1. Suppose that conditions A and (2.46) hold and that\n||Q||X0 \u2264 R < ( c2\u21262 \u2212 4\u03ba KC\u03b23,\u2217 )1/(1+\u03b2) := Rcrit. (2.47)\nThen the equation Q = L (Q) has only the trivial solution, that is, there exist no non-trivial TWSs.\n8 Proof: If (2.47) holds, we get ||L (Q)||X0 = ||M\u22121(N(Q))||X0 \u2264 ||M\u22121||X0,X0 \u00b7 ||N(Q)||X0 < 1. Thus L is a contraction, and the Contraction Mapping Theorem implies that there is a unique function Q that solves the equation Q = L (Q). Since L (0) = 0, this unique solutions is the trivial one. Note that due to (2.1) the potential V (x) can be expressed as V (x) = (1/2)x2+W (x), withW (x) \u2265 0 for all x \u2208 R, satisfying (2.3) and (2.4) (see also [26, Eq. (2.7) and Eq. (2.8)]). Furthermore, let us observe that as the (conserved) energy functional (2.16) is coercive, it can be used to bound the L2(\u2212L,L)-norm of the TWSs as follows\nE(Q) = \u222b L \u2212L [ 1 2 (Q\u2032(z)) 2 + 1 2 Q2(z) +W (Q(z)) + \u03ba 2 [Q(z + 1)\u2212Q(z)]2 ] dz\n= \u222b L \u2212L [ 1 2 (Q\u2032(z)) 2 +W (Q(z)) + \u03ba 2 [Q(z + 1)\u2212Q(z)]2 ] dz + 1 2 ||Q||2L2(\u2212L,L), (2.48)\nso that\n||Q||X0 \u2264 \u221a 2E. (2.49)\nIn conclusion, if the energy of the lattice system is less than Ecrit(c, \u03ba,K,\u2126) = \u221a 2Rcrit, no TWSs of given values for c, \u03ba,K,\u2126 exist. \u25a1 Combining the existence Theorem II.2 and Proposition II.1 we identify a ring in the phase space X0 with quantified radii in which the non-trivial travelling wave solutions with frequencies satisfying the enhanced condition (2.46), exist. This is illustrated in the cartoon of Fig. 1.\nTheorem II.3. Let the assumption A and the condition (2.46) hold. The system (1.1) possesses non-trivial TWSs only if\nRcrit = ( c2\u21262 \u2212 4\u03ba KC\u03b23,\u2217 )1/(1+\u03b2) \u2264 ||Q||X0 \u2264 Rmax = ( c2\u21262 \u2212 4\u03ba KC\u03b23,\u2217 )1/\u03b2 . (2.50)\nProof: On the one hand, Theorem II.2 establishes the existence of solutions when ||Q||X0 \u2264 Rmax. On the other hand, according to Proposition II.1, if ||Q||X0 < Rcrit only the trivial solution exists. Thus, a non-trivial solution exists only if\nRcrit < ||Q||X0 \u2264 Rmax,\nthat is, when (2.50) is satisfied. For the latter to be valid, we require Rcrit < Rmax, motivating the condition (2.46) on the frequencies of the TWSs. \u25a1\nC. Upper bound for the velocity\nBy using a fixed point approach, we derive upper bounds for the velocity c of TWSs. For this purpose, we rewrite equation (1.6) in the following operator form:\n\u2212Q\u2032\u2032(z) = 1 c2 {\u03ba ([Q(z)\u2212Q(z \u2212 1)]\u2212 [Q(z + 1)\u2212Q(z)]) + V \u2032(Q(z))}. (2.51)\nWe recall some basic auxiliary results, starting with the Friedrichs extension Theorem.\nTheorem II.4. Let L0 : D(L0) \u2286 X0 \u2192 X0 be a linear symmetric operator on the Hilbert space X0 with its domain D(L0) being dense in X0. Assume that there exists a constant c > 0 such that\n(L0v, v)X0 \u2265 c||v||2X0 for all v \u2208 D(L0).\nThen L0 has a self-adjoint extension L : D(L) \u2286 X1 \u2286 X0 \u2192 X0where X1 denotes the energetic Hilbert space endowed with the energetic scalar product (v, w)X1 = (Lv, w)X0 for all u, v \u2208 X1 and the energetic norm ||v||2X1 = (Lv, v)X0 . Furthermore, the operator equation\nLv = f, f \u2208 X0,\nhas a unique solution v \u2208 D(L). In addition, if L\u0302 : X1 \u2192 X\u22171 denotes the energetic extension of L, then L\u0302 is the canonical isomorphism from X1 to its dual X \u2217 1 and the operator equation\nL\u0302v = f, f \u2208 X\u22171 ,\nhas also a unique solution v \u2208 X1.\n9\nWith Theorem II.4 in hand, we discuss the left-hand side of Eq. (2.51). It is well known that Theorem II.4 is applicable to the operator L0 : D(L0) \u2286 L2(\u2212L,L) \u2192 L2(\u2212L,L), L0Q = \u2212Q\u2032\u2032(z), with domain of definition, D(L0), the space of C\u221e-functions on (\u2212L,L). SinceD(L0) is dense in X0, and inequality (2.13) holds, the Friedrichs extension of L0 is the operator L : D(L) \u2192 X0 where\nD(L) = { v \u2208 X1 : Lv \u2208 L2(\u2212L,L) } .\nConsequently, the equation\n\u2212Q\u2032\u2032(z) = f, for every f \u2208 L2(\u2212L,L), (2.52)\nhas a unique solution in D(L). Thus, we shall consider the right-hand side of Eq. (2.51) as a suitable mapping on L2(\u2212L,L). For its linear part, we have the following lemma proved in [7, Proposition 1, pg. 268].\nLemma II.1. The linear operators\nA1[Q(z)] = Q(z + 1)\u2212Q(z) = \u222b z+1 z Q\u2032(s)ds, A2[Q(z)] = Q(z)\u2212Q(z \u2212 1) = \u222b z z\u22121 Q\u2032(s)ds,\nare continuous from X1 to L2(\u2212L,L) \u2229 L\u221e(\u2212L,L) and ||AiQ||L\u221e \u2264 ||Q||X1 , ||AiQ||X0 \u2264 ||Q||X1 , i = 1, 2.\nUsing Theorem II.4, we treat the following auxiliary linear, non-homogeneous problem\n\u2212Q\u2032\u2032(z) = 1 c2 {\u03ba ([\u03a8(z)\u2212\u03a8(z \u2212 1)]\u2212 [\u03a8(z + 1)\u2212\u03a8(z)]) + V \u2032(\u03a8(z))} . (2.53)\nfor some arbitrary fixed \u03a8 \u2208 X1, as an equation of the form (2.52). In particular, we have the following result:\nProposition II.2. For any \u03a8 \u2208 X1, the equation (2.53) has a unique solution Q \u2208 D(L) \u2282 X1.\nProof: Equation (2.53) can be rewritten in the form\n\u2212Q\u2032\u2032(z) = 1 c2 {\u03ba([A2[\u03a8(z)]\u2212A1[\u03a8(z)]) + V \u2032(\u03a8(z))} := F [\u03a8(z)]. (2.54)\n10\nDue to the continuous embedding X1 \u2282 Lr(\u2212L,L) for any 1 \u2264 r \u2264 \u221e and condition (2.4), we have that for some constant C = C(K,\u03b2) > 0,\n||V \u2032(\u03a8)||2X0 = \u222b L \u2212L (V \u2032(\u03a8(z)))2dz \u2264 K2 \u222b L \u2212L |\u03a8(z)|2(\u03b2+1)dz \u2264 C||\u03a8||2(\u03b2+1)X1 .\nThen, for the right-hand side of Eq. (2.54) we get\n||F [\u03a8]||X0 \u2264 1\nc2 {\u03ba||A2[\u03a8]\u2212A1[\u03a8]||X0 + ||V \u2032(\u03a8(z))||X0}\n\u2264 1 c2\n{ 2\u03ba||\u03a8||X1 + C||\u03a8|| 2(\u03b2+1) X1 } . (2.55)\nThus, F [\u03a8] \u2208 L2(\u2212L,L), and by virtue of Theorem II.4 Eq. (2.54) has a unique solution Q \u2208 D(L). \u25a1\nWe now proceed with the implementation of the fixed point argument. To this aim we consider for some R > 0 the closed ball of X1, BR := {\u03c8 \u2208 X1 : ||\u03c8||X1 \u2264 R}. Proposition II.2 shows that the map T : X1 \u2192 X1 defined as\nT [\u03a8] = Q,\nwhere Q is the unique solution of the auxiliary problem (2.54), is well defined. Hence we introduce \u03a81,\u03a82 \u2208 BR such that Q = T [\u03a81] and P = T [\u03a82]. Then the difference Y = Q\u2212 P satisfies the equation\n\u2212Y \u2032\u2032(z) = F [\u03a81(z)]\u2212F [\u03a82(z)]\n= 1\nc2 {\u03ba (A1[\u03a82(z)]\u2212A1[\u03a81(z)] +A2[\u03a81(z)]\u2212A2[\u03a82(z)])}\n+ V \u2032(\u03a81(z))\u2212 V \u2032(\u03a82(z))} . (2.56)\nFrom Lemma II.1 the linear operators Ai : X1 \u2192 L2(\u2212L,L) \u2229 L\u221e(\u2212L,L) are globally Lipschitz,\n||Ai\u03c81 \u2212Ai\u03c82||X0 \u2264 ||\u03c81 \u2212 \u03c82||X1 , (2.57) ||Ai\u03c81 \u2212Ai\u03c82||L\u221e \u2264 ||\u03c81 \u2212 \u03c82||X1 , i = 1, 2.\nTo estimate the difference of the remaining terms in Eq. (2.56), we use (2.4) and the embedding X1 \u2282 L\u221e(\u2212L,L) with its embedding constant C\u2217,\u222b L\n\u2212L |V \u2032(\u03a81(z))\u2212 V \u2032(\u03a82(z))|2dz \u2264 K2 \u222b L \u2212L (|\u03a81(z)|\u03b2 + |\u03a82(z)|\u03b2)2|\u03a81(z)\u2212\u03a82(z)|2dz\n\u2264 K2 max \u2212L\u2264z\u2264L (|\u03a81(z)|\u03b2 + |\u03a82(z)|\u03b2) \u222b L \u2212L |\u03a81(z)\u2212\u03a82(z)|2dz = 2K2C2\u03b2\u2217 R 2\u03b2 ||\u03a81(z)\u2212\u03a82(z)||2X0 . (2.58)\nHence, for the right-hand side of (2.56) we get\n||F [\u03a81(z)]\u2212F [\u03a82(z)]||X0 \u2264M\u2225|\u03a81 \u2212\u03a82||X1 , (2.59)\nwhere the constant M is given by\nM = 2 c2 ( \u03ba+KC\u2217R \u03b2 ) . (2.60)\nNext, by multiplying (2.56) in the L2(\u2212L,L)-scalar product and using the Cauchy-Schwarz inequality and Young\u2019s inequality, we get the estimate\n||Y ||2X1 \u2264 ||F [\u03a81(z)]\u2212F [\u03a82(z)]||X0 ||Y ||X0 \u2264 M \u221a C(L)||\u03a81 \u2212\u03a82||X1 ||Y ||X1\n\u2264 1 2 ||Y ||2X1 +\nM2C(L)\n2 ||\u03a81 \u2212\u03a82||2X1 . (2.61)\n11\nNote that the Poincare\u0301 inequality (2.13) has been used. From (2.61) we derive\n||Y ||2X1 = ||T [\u03a81]\u2212 T [\u03a82]|| 2 X1 \u2264M 2C(L)||\u03a81 \u2212\u03a82||2X1 . (2.62)\nWe conclude that if the Lipschitz constant satisfies M \u221a C(L) < 1, (2.63)\nthen the map T : BR \u2192 BR is a contraction. Hence the map T satisfies the assumptions of the Banach Fixed Point Theorem and has a unique fixed point. By the assumptions we have that F(0) = 0. Therefore we deduce that if (2.63) holds, then the unique fixed point is the trivial one. Thus, nontrivial solutions exist only if (2.63) is violated, that is, when\nM \u221a C(L) > 1. (2.64)\nRegarding the upper bound for the velocity we summarise in\nTheorem II.5. An upper bound for the velocity c of nontrivial periodic TWSs qn(t) = Q(n\u2212 ct) = Q(z) of prescribed norm ||Q||X1 \u2264 R to the system (1.1), on the periodic lattice \u2212L \u2264 n \u2264 L, is given by\nc2 < 2(\u03ba+KC\u2217R \u03b2)C(L). (2.65)\na. Remarks on the physical significance of the estimates for the TWSs and their velocity. The estimates on the TWSs proved in Theorems II.2, II.3 and II.5 implicate a coherent dependence on the lattice parameters, the frequency \u2126 and R and the velocity c. Motivated by the discussion of [26, Section A, pg. 9], we aim to discuss the potential physical relevance of these estimates:\n1. For fixed m and \u03ba, we observe that\nlim \u2126\u2192\u221e Rmax = lim \u2126\u2192\u221e\nRcrit = \u221e, for fixed c,\nlim c\u2192\u221e Rmax = lim c\u2192\u221e\nRcrit = \u221e, for fixed \u2126.\nBoth limits are physically relevant in the sense that in the limit of arbitrary large frequency or velocity, a type of \u201cenergy\u201d of the solution, measured herein in the norm of X0, should become also arbitrarily large. This behavior can be relevant to energy localization phenomena [30] or the notion of quasi-collapse [31]. Note that in the second limit as c \u2192 \u221e, the growth of the norm in X0, implies due to the Poincare\u0301 inequality (2.13) (or due to Sobolev embeddings), the growth of the kinetic energy of the TWSs, which is consistent with the growth of c.\n2. The above coherent dependence on the lattice parameters is also evident in the derived upper bound for the velocity (2.65). Theorem II.5 justifies that TWs of given \u201cenergy\u201d measured by the norm of X1 can evolve with velocity satisfying the upper-bound (2.65).\nIII. SOFT ON-SITE POTENTIALS\nIn this section we study the KG lattice with soft on-site potentials of the form\nV (x) = \u2212\u03c9 2 0\n2 x2 +\na\np+ 1 xp+1, a > 0, p > 1, (3.1)\nwhere we assume that p+ 1 = 2r > 0, with integer r. That is, p is an odd integer so that the on-site potentials V (x) possess the reflection symmetry V (x) = V (\u2212x). The standard quartic double-well potential is obtained for p = 3. We prove the existence of periodic TWSs on finite lattices with imposed periodic boundary conditions utilising the Mountain Pass Theorem.\n12\nA. Periodic TWSs: Existence by the Mountain Pass Theorem\nWe consider periodic TWSs satisfying (2.5), that is, solutions Q(z) performing oscillations about Q = 0 so that the associated energy E > 0. Hence, the Poincare\u0301 inequality applies. These periodic TWSs, as solutions of (1.6), are critical points of the action functional S : X1 \u2192 R given by\nS(Q) = \u222b L \u2212L [ c2 2 (Q\u2032(z)) 2 + \u03c920 2 Q2(z)\u2212 a p+ 1 Qp+1(z)\u2212 \u03ba 2 [Q(z + 1)\u2212Q(z)]2 ] dz.\nWe get\n< S\u2032(Q), P > = \u222b L \u2212L [ c2Q\u2032(z)P \u2032(z) + \u03c920Q(z)P (z)\u2212 aQp(z)P (z)\n+ \u03ba[Q(z + 1)\u2212 2Q(z) +Q(z \u2212 1)]P (z)] dz, P,Q \u2208 X1, (3.2)\nwhere < \u00b7, \u00b7 > is the standard duality bracket between X1 and its dual X \u22171 ; by the definition of the derivative S\u2032, for any Q \u2208 X1, the functional S\u2032(Q) : X1 \u2192 R is a linear functional acting on any P \u2208 X1 as S\u2032(Q)[P ] =< S\u2032(Q), P > [41]. To prove the existence of TWSs we facilitate the Mountain Pass Theorem (MPT). We recall [[41], Definition 4.1, p. 130] (Palais-Smale (PS) condition) and [[41], Theorem 6.1, p. 140] (Mountain Pass Theorem (MPT) of AmbrosettiRabinowitz [40]).\nDefinition III.1. Let X be a Banach space and E : X \u2192 R be C1. We say that E satisfies condition (PS) if, for any sequence {un} \u2208 X such that |E(un)| is bounded and E\u2032(un) \u2192 0 as n \u2192 \u221e in X\u2217, there exists a convergent subsequence.\nTheorem III.1. Let E : X \u2192 R be C1 and satisfy (A) E(0) = 0, (B) \u2203\u03c1 > 0, \u03b1 > 0: ||u||X = \u03c1 implies E(u) \u2265 \u03b1, (C) \u2203u1 \u2208 X: ||u1||X \u2265 \u03c1 and E(u1) < \u03b1. Define\n\u0393 = { \u03b3 \u2208 C0([0, 1], X) : \u03b3(0) = 0, \u03b3(1) = u1 } . (3.3)\nLet F\u03b3 = {\u03b3(t) \u2208 X : 0 \u2264 t \u2264 1} and L = {F\u03b3 : \u03b3 \u2208 \u0393}. If E satisfies (PS), then\n\u03b2 := inf F\u03b3\u2208L\nsup{E(v) : v \u2208 F\u03b3} \u2265 \u03b1, (3.4)\nis a critical value of the functional E.\nWe proceed by proving the validity of the assumptions of the MPT:\nLemma III.1. Assume either (i) \u03c920 \u2265 4\u03ba, or (ii) \u03c920 < 4\u03ba and c\n2 > C(L)(4\u03ba\u2212 \u03c920). Then the functional S satisfies the PS-condition.\nProof: Assume S(Qm) is bounded, i.e. |S(Qm)| \u2264M for all m \u2208 N, and\nS\u2032(Qm) \u2192 0, as m\u2192 \u221e in X \u22171 . (3.5)\nRecall also that\n| < S\u2032(Qm), Qm > | \u2264 ||S\u2032(Qm)||X\u22171 ||Qm||X1 , (3.6)\nby the standard inequality for the duality bracket [43, Sec. 21.5, pg. 251]. Then, using (3.5),we deduce that for any \u03f5 > 0, there exists N(\u03f5) \u2208 N such that\n||S\u2032(Qm)||X\u22171 \u2264 \u03f5, for m > N(\u03f5). (3.7)\nApplying (3.7) for \u03f5 \u2264 1 and using the inequality (3.6), we deduce that\n| < S\u2032(Qm), Qm > | \u2264 ||Qm||X1 , for m > N(\u03f5). (3.8)\n13\nHence, for chosen b \u2208 (1/(p+ 1), 1/2), we deduce from (3.8), that\nb | < S\u2032(Qm), Qm > | \u2264 ||Qm||X1 < ||Qm||X1 + 1, for m > N(\u03f5). (3.9)\nWe will use (3.9) to prove that Qm is bounded in X1, as follows: First, we derive the inequality\n1 +M + ||Qm||X1 \u2265 M \u2212 b < S\u2032(Qm), Qm \u2265 S(Qm)\u2212 b < S\u2032(Qm), Qm >\n=\n( 1 2 \u2212 b )\u222b L\n\u2212L\n[ c2 (Q\u2032m(z)) 2 + \u03c920Q 2 m(z)\u2212 \u03ba[Qm(z + 1)\u2212Qm(z)]2 ] dz\n\u2212 a p+ 1 (1\u2212 (p+ 1)b) \u222b L \u2212L Qpm(z)dz\n\u2265 ( 1 2 \u2212 b )[ c2||Q\u2032m||2L2 + (\u03c920 \u2212 4\u03ba)||Qm||2L2 ] . (3.10)\nIf assumption (i) holds, then\n1 +M + ||Qm||X1 \u2265 ( 1 2 \u2212 b ) c2||Qm||2X1 , (3.11)\nand if assumption (ii) holds, then 1 +M + ||Qm||X1 \u2265 ( 1 2 \u2212 b )( c2 \u2212 C(L)(4\u03ba\u2212 \u03c920) ] ||Qm||2X1 , (3.12)\nimplying that Qm is bounded in X1. Hence, there is a subsequence of Qm (not relabeled) and a Q \u2208 X1 such that Qm \u2192 Q weakly in X1, so that by Sobolev compact embedding, one has the strong convergence Qm \u2192 Q in L2(\u2212L,L) (and in C([\u2212L,L])). Using Ho\u0308lder\u2019s inequality and the embedding X1 \u2282 L\u221e(\u2212L,L), we obtain\n||Qm \u2212Q||2X1 = 1 c2 (< S\u2032(Qm)\u2212 S\u2032(Q), Qm \u2212Q >\n\u2212 1 c2 \u222b L \u2212L [( \u03c920(Qm(z)\u2212Q(z))2 \u2212 \u03ba[Qm(z + 1)\u2212Q(z + 1)\u2212 (Qm(z)\u2212Q(z))]2\n\u2212 a(Qm(z)\u2212Q(z))p+1 ] dz )\n\u2264 1 c2 | < S\u2032(Qm)\u2212 S\u2032(Q), Qm \u2212Q > | + 1\nc2 ( (\u03c920 + 4\u03ba)||Qm \u2212Q||L2 + a||Qpm \u2212Qp||L2(\u2212L,L) ) ||Qm \u2212Q||L2(\u2212L,L). (3.13)\nThe first term on the right-hand side of (3.13) converges to zero because by assumption < S\u2032(Qm)\u2212S\u2032(Q), Qm\u2212Q >\u2192 0 as m \u2192 \u221e. The last converges to zero by strong convergence. Thus, ||Qm \u2212 Q||X1 = 0 so that (Qm)m\u2208Z has a strongly convergent subsequence and the proof is finished. \u25a1\nLemma III.2. The functional S is C1 on X1.\nProof: The functional S can be expressed as\nS(q) = c2\n2 (Q,Q) + \u0393(Q), (3.14)\nwhere\n\u0393(Q) = \u222b L \u2212L [ \u03c920 2 Q2(z)\u2212 a p+ 1 Qp+1(z)\u2212 \u03ba 2 (Q(z + 1)\u2212Q(z))2 ] dz. (3.15)\nContinuity of the quadratic term (Q,Q) is obvious. By using The embedding X1 \u2282 L\u221e(\u2212L,L) which implies that Qp \u2208 X0 and the Poincare\u0301 inequality (2.13) we get the estimate,\n||Qp||2X0 = \u222b L \u2212L |Q(z)|2pdz \u2264 C(L)||Q||2pX1 . (3.16)\n14\nThen, we have that\n|\u0393(Q)| \u2264 \u03c9 2 0\n2 ||Q||2L2 +\na\np+ 1 C(L)||Q||p+1X1 + 2\u03ba||Q|| 2 L2 \u2264 C(L) (( \u03c920 2 + 2\u03ba ) ||Q||2X1 + a p+ 1 ||Q||p+1X1 ) <\u221e. (3.17)\nThe Gateaux derivative of \u0393 exists and is given by\n< \u0393\u2032(Q), h > = \u222b L \u2212L [ \u03c920Q(z)\u2212 aQp(z)\n+ \u03ba(A1[Q(z)]\u2212A2[Q(z)])]h(z)dz. (3.18)\nTo prove that \u0393\u2032 is continuous, we let ||h||X1 \u2264 1 and Qm \u2192 Q in X1. Then\n|< \u0393\u2032(Qm)\u2212 \u0393\u2032(Q), h >| = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u222b L \u2212L [ \u03c920(Qm(z)\u2212Q(z))\u2212 a(Qpm(z)\u2212Qp(z))\n+ \u03ba(A1[Qm(z)]\u2212A2[Qm(z)]\u2212 (A1[Q(z)]\u2212A2[Q(z)]))]h(z)dz| \u2264 \u03c920 ||Qm \u2212Q||2L2 + aC (||Qm||L\u221e , ||Q||L\u221e) ||Qm \u2212Q||2L2(\u2212L,L) + 2\u03ba||Qm \u2212Q|| 2 L2(\u2212L,L)\n= ( \u03c920 + aC (||Qm||L\u221e , ||Q||L\u221e) + 2\u03ba ) ||Qm \u2212Q||2L2(\u2212L,L) \u2264 C\u03f5,\nfor m sufficiently large. Hence\n|< \u0393\u2032(Qm)\u2212 \u0393\u2032(Q), h >| \u2192 0 as m\u2192 \u221e,\nand the proof of the lemma is completed. \u25a1 Obviously, S(0) = 0, therefore condition (A) of the MPT is satisfied. For the remaining conditions (B) and (C), the proofs are given as follows: Proof of (B): We distinguish the cases (i) \u03c920 \u2265 4\u03ba, and (ii) \u03c920 < 4\u03ba, c2 > C(L)(4\u03ba\u2212 \u03c920). (i) With the aid of the estimate\u222b L\n\u2212L\n[ a\np+ 1 Qp+1(z) +\n\u03ba 2 [Q(z + 1)\u2212Q(z)]2\n] dz \u2264 a\np+ 1 C(L)||Q||p+1X1 + 2\u03ba||Q|| 2 L2(\u2212L,L),\nwe get the sufficient condition\nc2 2 ||Q||2X1 > a p+ 1 C(L)||Q||p+1X1 ,\nfor S(Q) being positive. Conclusively, for ||Q||X1 small enough, say ||Q||X1 = \u03c1, and\n0 < \u03c1 <\n( (p+ 1)c2\n2aC(L)\n)1/(p\u22121) (3.19)\nthere is a \u03b1 > 0 with S(Q) \u2265 \u03b1 for all ||Q||X1 = \u03c1. (ii) In this case we use the estimate\u222b L\n\u2212L\n[ a\np+ 1 Qp+1(z) +\n\u03ba 2 [Q(z + 1)\u2212Q(z)]2\n] dz \u2264 a\np+ 1 C(L)||Q||p+1X1 + 2\u03baC(L)||Q|| 2 X1 .\nUsing the Poincare\u0301 inequality we derive the following condition for S > 0:\n1\n2\n( c2 \u2212 (4\u03ba\u2212 \u03c920)C(L) ) ||Q||2X1 > a\np+ 1 C(L)||Q||p+1X1 .\nHence, for ||Q||X1 small enough, say ||Q||X1 = \u03c1, and\n0 < \u03c1 <\n( (p+ 1)\n2aC(L) (c2 \u2212 (4\u03ba\u2212 \u03c920))\n)1/(p\u22121) , (3.20)\nthere is a \u03b1 > 0 with S(Q) \u2265 \u03b1 for all ||Q||X1 = \u03c1. Proof of (C): For ||Q||X0 \u0338= 0 we observe that\nS(tQ) = \u222b L \u2212L [ c2 2 t2 (Q\u2032(z)) 2 + \u03c920 2 t2Q2(z)\u2212 a p+ 1 tp+1Qp+1(z)\u2212 \u03ba 2 t2[Q(z + 1)\u2212Q(z)]2 ] dz \u2192 \u2212\u221e, (3.21)\nas t\u2192 \u221e. To summarise, by virtue of the MPT we state\n15\nTheorem III.2. Let either (i) \u03c920 \u2265 4\u03ba, or (ii) \u03c920 < 4\u03ba and c\n2 > C(L)(4\u03ba\u2212 \u03c920). Then the system (1.1) on the periodic lattice \u2212L \u2264 n \u2264 L with an on-site potential (3.1) has at least one nontrivial\nperiodic TWS.\nB. Thresholds for the average kinetic energy of TWSs of prescribed speed\nFor the derivation of lower bounds of the average kinetic energy of TWSs we utilise the fixed point method outlined in Section II. In the present case, using Theorem II.4, we treat the following auxiliary linear, non-homogeneous problem\n\u2212Q\u2032\u2032(z) = \u03ba c2 { (\u03a8(z)\u2212\u03a8(z \u2212 1))\u2212 (\u03a8(z + 1)\u2212\u03a8(z))\u2212 \u03c920\u03a8(z) + a (\u03a8(z)) p} , (3.22)\nfor some arbitrary fixed \u03a8 \u2208 X1, as an equation of the form (2.52). We have the following result.\nProposition III.1. For any \u03a8 \u2208 X1, the equation (3.22) has a unique solution Q \u2208 D(L) \u2282 X1.\nProof: We reformulate Eq. (3.22) as\n\u2212Q\u2032\u2032(z) = 1 c2 { \u03ba(A2 [\u03a8(z)]\u2212A1 [\u03a8(z)])\u2212 \u03c920\u03a8(z) + a (\u03a8(z)) p} := F [\u03a8(z)] . (3.23)\nWe use again the estimate (3.17) for \u03a8,\n||\u03a8p||2X0 = \u222b L \u2212L |\u03a8(z)|2pdz \u2264 C(L)||\u03a8||2pX1 .\nThen, for the right-hand side of Eq. (3.23) we get\n||F [\u03a8]||X0 \u2264 1\nc2\n{ \u03ba||A2[\u03a8]\u2212A1[\u03a8]||X0 + C(L)\u03c920 ||\u03a8||X1 + C0a||\u03a8|| 2p X1 } \u2264 1\nc2\n{ 2\u03ba||\u03a8||X1 + C1\u03c920 ||\u03a8||X1 + C0a||\u03a8|| 2p X1 } . (3.24)\nThus, F [\u03a8] \u2208 L2(\u2212L,L), and due to Theorem II.4, Eq. (3.23) has a unique solution Q \u2208 D(L). \u25a1\nWe proceed along the lines in Section IIC by adapting the steps for the use of the fixed point argument to the present case, that is replacing the hard potential V (Q) in the expressions (2.56) by the soft potential (3.1). In particular, we need the following estimate of the difference of the power nonlinearity terms\u222b L\n\u2212L |sp1 \u2212 s p 2|2 \u2264 p2 \u222b L \u2212L {\u222b 1 0 |\u03be|p\u22121|s1 \u2212 s2|d\u03b8 }2 , (3.25)\nwhere s1, s2 \u2208 R, and \u03be = \u03b8s1 + (1\u2212 \u03b8)s2, \u03b8 \u2208 (0, 1). Then, we have that\u222b L \u2212L |[\u03a81(z)]p \u2212 [\u03a82(z)]p|2 dz \u2264 p2||\u03be||2(p\u22121)L\u221e \u222b L \u2212L |\u03a81(z)\u2212\u03a82(z)|2dz\n\u2264 p2||\u03be||2(p\u22121)L\u221e C \u222b L \u2212L |\u03a8\u20321(z)\u2212\u03a8\u20322(z)|2dz, (3.26)\nfor \u03be(z) = \u03b8\u03a81(z) + (1\u2212 \u03b8)\u03a82(z). For the norm ||\u03be||L\u221e we have the estimate\n||\u03be||L\u221e \u2264 \u03b8||\u03a81||L\u221e + (1\u2212 \u03b8)||\u03a82||L\u221e \u2264 \u03b8C\u2217||\u03a81||X1 + (1\u2212 \u03b8)C\u2217||\u03a82||X1 , (3.27)\nwhere the constant C\u2217 > 0 denotes the optimal constant of the embedding X1 \u2282 L\u221e(\u2212L,L). Therefore, since \u03a81,\u03a82 \u2208 BR, we have that ||\u03be||L\u221e \u2264 C\u2217R. Thus by using (3.26) and (3.27) we deduce the inequality\n||[\u03a81(z)]p \u2212 [\u03a82(z)]p||X0 \u2264 p \u221a C(C\u2217R) p\u22121||\u03a81 \u2212\u03a82||X1 .\n16\nThen the Lipschitz constant M in the equation equivalent to (2.60) in II C is determined by\nM = 1\nc2\n( 2\u03ba+ C(L)\u03c920 + p \u221a C(L)aCp\u22121\u2217 R p\u22121 ) . (3.28)\nUsing again the fixed point argument we end up with the following statement: If\nM \u221a C(L) < 1 (3.29)\nholds, the unique fixed point is the trivial one. Nontrivial solutions exist only if M \u221a C(L) > 1. (3.30)\nFrom Eq. (3.28) we derive the following condition for the existence of nontrivial solutions:\nR2 >\n[ c2 \u2212 \u221a C(L)(2\u03ba+ C(L)\u03c920)\nC(L)\n] 2 p\u22121 (\n1\npaCp\u22121\u2217\n) 2 p\u22121\n:= Tthresh. (3.31)\nWe conclude:\nTheorem III.5. Consider the system (1.1) on the periodic lattice of 2L particles, \u2212L \u2264 n \u2264 L with a soft on-site potential (3.1) with reflection symmetry V (x) = V (\u2212x). Every nontrivial periodic travelling wave solution qn(t) = Q(n\u2212 ct) = Q(z) with speed c satisfying\nc2 > \u221a C(L)(2\u03ba+ C(L)\u03c920) = c 2 crit, (3.32)\nmust have average kinetic energy T (Q) = 12 \u222b L \u2212L U \u2032(z)2dz satisfying the lower bound\nTthresh < 2T (Q). (3.33)\nThe relation (3.33) can be regarded as a threshold value criterion for the average kinetic energy in order that travelling waves of speed c > c\u2217 exist.\nWe remark that further useful quantifications of the norm and energy thresholds can be provided as explicit values of the optimal constants C\u2217 and C1,\u2217 of the Sobolev embeddings used in our proofs (see in [45]).\nAcknowledgment The authors are grateful to the referees for their valuable comments and suggestions which improved considerably the presentation of the manuscript."
