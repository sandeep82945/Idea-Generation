    "abstractText": "We present a new mechanism contributing to the detection of photoassociated long-range Rydberg molecules via pulsed-field ionization: ionic products, created by the decay of a long-range Rydberg molecule, modify the excitation spectrum of surrounding ground-state atoms and facilitate the excitation of further atoms into Rydberg states by the photoassociation light. Such an ion-mediated excitation mechanism has been previously called Coulomb anti-blockade. Pulsed-field ionisation typically doesn\u2019t discriminate between the ionization of a long-range Rydberg molecule and an isolated Rydberg atom, and thus the number of atomic ions detected by this mechanism is not proportional to the number of long-range Rydberg molecules present in the probe volume. By combining high-resolution UV and RF spectroscopy of a dense, ultracold gas of cesium atoms, theoretical modeling of the molecular level structures of long-range Rydberg molecules bound below n P3/2 Rydberg states of cesium, and a rate model of the photoassociation and decay processes, we unambiguously identify the signatures of this detection mechanism in the photoassociation of long-range Rydberg molecules bound below atomic asymptotes with negative Stark shifts.",

            "text": "The role of Coulomb anti-blockade in the photoassociation of long-range Rydberg molecules\nMichael Peper,\u2217 Martin Trautmann, and Johannes Deiglmayr\u2020\nDepartment of Physics and Geoscience, University of Leipzig, 04109 Leipzig, Germany (Dated: November 10, 2022)\nWe present a new mechanism contributing to the detection of photoassociated long-range Rydberg molecules via pulsed-field ionization: ionic products, created by the decay of a long-range Rydberg molecule, modify the excitation spectrum of surrounding ground-state atoms and facilitate the excitation of further atoms into Rydberg states by the photoassociation light. Such an ion-mediated excitation mechanism has been previously called Coulomb anti-blockade. Pulsed-field ionisation typically doesn\u2019t discriminate between the ionization of a long-range Rydberg molecule and an isolated Rydberg atom, and thus the number of atomic ions detected by this mechanism is not proportional to the number of long-range Rydberg molecules present in the probe volume. By combining high-resolution UV and RF spectroscopy of a dense, ultracold gas of cesium atoms, theoretical modeling of the molecular level structures of long-range Rydberg molecules bound below n 2P3/2 Rydberg states of cesium, and a rate model of the photoassociation and decay processes, we unambiguously identify the signatures of this detection mechanism in the photoassociation of long-range Rydberg molecules bound below atomic asymptotes with negative Stark shifts.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nLong-range Rydberg molecules (LRMs) are bound states of a Rydberg atom and a ground-state atom where the bond is the result of elastic scattering of the Rydberg atom\u2019s electron from a ground-state atom within its orbit [1]. Since their first observation by photoassociation spectroscopy in an ultracold gas of rubidium about a decade ago [2], numerous studies have focused on their properties, such as the presence of very large permanent electric dipole moments [3, 4] or their large spatial extent, which was exploited to probe pair-correlation functions [5, 6], polaron dynamics [7] in degenerate quantum gases and ultracold chemical reactions in dense gases [8, 9]. A detailed understanding of the structure and dynamics of LRMs is a prerequisite for the realization of proposals to create exotic states of matter via the photoassociation of LRMs [10, 11].\nLRMs are formed by photoassociation in ultracold gases and detected by pulsed-field ionization (PFI) and the observation of the resulting ions by charged-particle detectors [12, 13]. Figure 1 schematically depicts the different mechanisms through which (neutral) long-range Rydberg molecules (LRM) are detected using a chargedparticle detector. In mechanism A, a LRM (blue dimer) is ionized by PFI, removing the Rydberg electron. Because the Rydberg electron provides the binding of the LRM, its removal causes dissociation of the LRM into a neutral ground-state atom and a Cs+ ion (red symbol). The resulting Cs+ ion is accelerated by the ionization field towards the micro-channel-plate detector (MCP), causing a peak in the measured current after a distinct\n\u2217 Present address: Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Princeton University, Princeton, New Jersey 08544, USA \u2020 johannes.deiglmayr@uni-leipzig.de\ntime of flight. In mechanism B, the LRM decays via vibrational auto-ionization to a stable Cs+2 molecular ion prior to PFI [8, 9, 14]. The Cs+2 ion is also accelerated by the applied pulsed electric field towards the MCP. However, because the mass of the molecular ion is twice that of the atomic ion produced in mechanism A, the characteristic time of flight for mechanism B is approximately\u221a\n2 times larger than for mechanism A. These two detection mechanisms are well known and have been used in previous works, e.g., to characterize the formation of heteronuclear LRMs [15].\nHere we report on a third detection mechanism B\u2217, ionfacilitated excitation of ground-state atoms into Rydberg states. This mechanism is initiated by the formation of a molecular ion through molecular autoionization (mechanism B) during the photoassociation laser pulse. The electric field of the ion influences the excitation frequency of neighboring atoms through the Stark effect. Figure 2 depicts the Stark shift of the 40 2P3/2 state of a cesium\nar X\niv :2\n21 1.\n04 74\n4v 1\n[ ph\nys ic\ns. at\nom -p\nh] 9\nN ov\n2 02\n2\n2\natom as a function of distance from a singly-charged ion. Because the frequency of the photoassociation laser is tuned below the atomic resonance by the binding energy of the addressed LRM, the transition from the ground state to the atomic Rydberg state becomes resonant at a certain internuclear distance Rfac between the ion and the ground-state atom as illustrated in Figure 2.\nThe ion thus facilitates the resonant excitation of ground-state atoms into the 40 2P3/2 state, an enhancement effect for which previously the expression Coulomb anti-blockade was coined [18]. Subsequent PFI ionizes the excited atoms and, caused by the formation of a single LRM, an ion arriving at the time-of-flight of Cs+2 , and one or more ions arriving at the time-of-flight of Cs+ are observed. Noteworthy, this mechanism creates an ion signal at the same arrival time as PFI of LRMs, exclusively at molecular photoassociation resonances, but the initially formed LRM has already decayed before PFI. In contrast to a facilitated excitation of ground-state atoms through Rydberg-Rydberg interactions [19, 20], this facilitation mechanism does not cause an excitation avalanche because there remains only a single ion present in the system. The mechanism B\u2217 is also closely related to the formation of the recently discovered class of ion\u2013 Rydberg-atom molecules, bound states of an ion and a Rydberg atom created by excitation of Rydberg-atoms in the vicinity of an ion with negligible kinetic energy [16, 17, 21]. In our case, the molecular ion is formed by the autoionization process Cs2 \u2192 Cs+2 + e\u2212 and has substantial kinetic energy: the binding energy of the formed Cs+2 ion can be up to hc\u00d75000 cm\u22121 [14, 22], a fraction of 4\u00d7 10\u22126 of which (i.e., up to h\u00d7600 MHz) is partitioned to the heavy ion. If the molecular ion is formed in low-lying vibrational levels, the initial kinetic energy of\nthe formed ion-Rydberg\u2013atom pair exceeds the potential energy at typical laser detunings and the pair formed by facilitated excitation is not bound."

            "text": "To investigate the presence of ion-facilitated excitation in typical LRM photoassociation experiments, we study in detail the photoassociation dynamics close to the asymptote 40 2P3/2 in cesium. We note that the Rydberg-Rydberg interaction potentials between two cesium atoms in the n 2P3/2 Rydberg state are repulsive for n \u2264 41 [23], resulting in a strong suppression of facilitation by Rydberg-Rydberg interactions for these states. Details of the experimental setup and procedures have been described in previous works [15] and only the main aspects are summarized in the following. A cloud of 2\u00d7 107 cesium atoms with a density of 1\u00d7 1011 cm\u22123 and a temperature of 40 \u00b5K is prepared in the 6 2S1/2(F = 3) ground state by laser cooling in a magneto-optical trap, followed by magnetic compression and an optical molasses. A modified ring dye laser system (Coherent 899- 21), pumped by a frequency-doubled continuous-wave Nd:YVO4 laser (Quantum finesse 532), and a frequencydoubling unit (Coherent MBD 200) are used to produce frequency-tunable light for the excitation into Rydberg states at wavelengths around 319 nm. The frequency of the ring dye laser is stabilized to an atomic transition in potassium by a transfer cavity using a variable-offsetelectronic-sideband locking technique [24]. Residual frequency drifts are on the order of 100 kHz d\u22121. An AOM is used to create short pulses of variable intensity and length which are applied to the atomic sample. Excitation of Rydberg states is detected by PFI using ramped electric fields [25]. For ground-state\u2013Rydberg-state transitions, we observe typical line widths on the order of 1.5 MHz [26].\nTypical spectra are shown in Figure 3 for photoassociation pulses of 6.5 \u00b5s [panels a)/c)] and 27 \u00b5s [panels b)/d)] length. In Figure 3 a) and b), the time-of-flight signal was integrated in a time interval around the arrival time of Cs+ ions and in Figure 3 c) and d) around the arrival time of Cs+2 ions (see also Figure 1). The spectra exhibit several resonances, some of which are only partially resolved. Photoassociation resonances are observed in all spectra at the same detunings but with clear differences in the intensity ratios. In the Cs+-PFI spectra a) and b), the contrast between the strongest feature at a detuning of \u221226.4 MHz and the other resonances is significantly reduced for the longer photoassociation pulse, hinting at the presence of a non-linear excitation or detection process. The Cs+2 spectra c) and d) have very similar intensity ratios, which, however, differ strongly from the ratios in the PFI spectra. Most notably, the resonance at \u221226.4 MHz is much weaker than one would expect from the PFI spectrum.\nTo investigate the contributions of mechanisms A and\n3\nB\u2217 to the detected PFI signal we perform RF spectroscopy of the sample after photoassociation [27]. To this end, we apply a RF field with frequency close to the transition to the neighbouring 39 2D5/2 state after the photoassociation pulse. In this state, the Rydberg electron is less strongly bound and the atom or LRM ionizes at a smaller electric field compared to 40 2P3/2. Transfer between the atomic (molecular) Rydberg states is detected by applying a ramped electric-field-ionization pulse. The difference in binding energy causes a difference in the ionization time and consequently a shift in the arrival time of the resulting ion [25] at the MCP. In Figure 4, the fractional population in the 39 2D5/2 state is color-coded and plotted as a function of the detuning of the UV laser from the atomic resonance (i.e., the binding energy of photoassociated LRMs) and the detuning of the RF frequency from the atomic transition. The data in the lower panel reveals the transfer from isolated atoms in the state 40 2P3/2 to the 39\n2D5/2 Rydberg state, which is the signature of the ion-facilitation mechanism B\u2217. Because of the molecular binding energy, the RF transfer occurs for a LRM at different detunings than for an isolated atom. This is clearly visible in the upper panel of Figure 4 for the photoassociation resonance at a UV laser detuning of \u221226.4 MHz. At a positive RF detuning of 26.4 MHz, dissociation of LRMs into the continuum above the 39 2D5/2 asymptote is observed [27]. At lower frequencies, a bound-bound transition to a molecular state bound below the 39 2D5/2 asymptote results in a resonance at an RF detuning of about 5 MHz. This clearly indicates a dominant contribution from mechanism A to the PFI signal at this photoassociation resonance."

            "text": "We model the molecular level structure and experimental photoassociation spectra using the Hamiltonian of Eiles and Greene [28]. Details of the numerical methods have been published previously [15, 27] and only the main aspects are summarized here. We solve the Hamiltonian\n4 in the molecular frame including the hyperfine structure of the ground state and the fine structure of the Rydberg states in an atomic basis set consisting of the closestlying low-l Rydberg states and one degenerate manifold above and below the asymptote of interest on a grid of internuclear distances. The projection of the total angular momentum on the internuclear axis \u2126 remains a good quantum number and the calculations are performed separately for each value of \u2126. The electron-cesium scattering phases shifts are calculated following Khuskivadze et al. [29] where we have adjusted the parameters of the model-potential to reproduce experimental binding energies over a range of n and l asymptotes [30].\nWe solve the nuclear Schro\u0308dinger equation to obtain the energies, wavefunctions, and lifetimes of vibrational levels using the modified Milne-Phase amplitude method [31]. The results for LRMs bound below the 40 2P3/2-6\n2S1/2(F = 3) asymptote are shown in Figure 5 where all potential-energy curves and the wavefunctions of selected vibrational levels are drawn. The amplitudes of photoassociation resonances are approximated by the expression\nAi = C (\u222b \u03a8i(R)R 2dR )2 , (1)\nwhere \u03a8i(R) is the normalized vibrational wavefunction of level i and C is a global scaling constant absorbing units and experimental parameters such as the density of ground-state atoms and laser intensity. Equation 1 assumes that the initial scattering wavefunction of the two colliding ground-state atoms is constant and coherent over the extent of the vibrational wavefunction of the photoassociated LRM. We find this assumption to reproduce experimental ratios of line strengths better than the assumption of an incoherent initial scattering state. An experimental photoassociation spectrum is then simulated as\nS(\u03bd) = states\u2211 i AiV (\u03bd \u2212 \u03bdi, \u03c3,\u0393i) , (2)\nwhere V is a Pseudo-Voigt line profile with \u03bdi and \u0393i being the binding energy and line width of molecular resonance i, respectively, and \u03c3 being the effective experimental resolution.\nBecause of the high spectral density of vibrational levels and the sensitivity of their precise energies on the details of the model, we don\u2019t attempt to assign molecular quantum numbers to all observed photoassociation resonances. However, the comparison between the simulated spectrum in Figure 5 and the experimental spectra in Figure 3 yields important insights: i) the resonance at \u221226.4 MHz can be assigned to the formation of LRMs in the v = 0 level of the outermost well of the more-strongly bound, triplet-scattering-dominated electronic states. The potential-energy curves for \u2126 = 1/2, 3/2, and 5/2 are degenerated in this range of internuclear distances where s-wave scattering dominates, enhancing\nFigure 5.

The calculated lifetimes of these levels (with respect to tunneling to shorter internuclear distances and eventual vibrational auto-ionization) are much longer than the radiative lifetime of the atomic Rydberg state. This agrees very well with the conclusions drawn above from Figure 4 that LRMs formed at a detuning of \u221226.4 MHz have predominantly survived until detection by PFI (mechanism A) and explains the observation made in the discussion of Figure 3 that much fewer Cs+2 ions are observed at this resonance compared to the other resonances.\nii) The other photoassociation resonances observed in the range of detunings depicted in Figure 3 can be attributed to the formation of LRMs in the inner wells of electronic states. The contribution from p-wave scattering to the binding of these states causes spin-orbit interactions which lift the degeneracy in \u2126 [32], increasing significantly the spectral density of molecular states. The reduced extent of the tunneling barriers towards short internuclear distances in the inner wells results in short predicted lifetimes below few microseconds. This is consistent with the conclusion drawn from Figure 4 that LRMs formed at the corresponding detunings predominantly autoionize before detection (mechanism B).\niii) The simulated spectrum (Figure 5) reproduces qualitatively the experimental ratios between features i) and ii) in the PFI spectrum for a short photoassociation pulse [Figure 3 a)]. For the longer photoassociation pulse, however, the PFI signals detected at short-lived molecular resonances [features ii)] are disproportionately enhanced. This is further evidence for a contribution from mechanism B\u2217 to the PFI signal detected at these reso-\n5 nances."

            "text": "We systematically investigate the decay and facilitation dynamics by recording photoassociation spectra as shown in Figure 3 for photoassociation pulses of different length and additionally insert a variable delay between photoassociation and detection by PFI. To extract the amplitudes of unresolved photoassociation resonances, we fit the spectra with an empirical line shape model. The model represents a photoassociation spectrum as a sum of Gaussian line-profiles, depicted as gray lines in Figure 3. Position and width of the individual resonances are determined from a fit to one selected spectrum where individual resonances are reasonably resolved. We then adjust this model to every recorded spectrum by only adjusting the individual amplitude, minimizing the squared sum of residuals.\nExemplary results of this procedure are depicted in Figure 6 for two resonances. We model the timedependent signals for ions produced by PFI and Cs+2 ions with the following system of rate equations:\nN\u0307LRM(t) = kPAI(t)\u2212 kAINLRM(t)\u2212 kradNLRM(t) N\u0307Cs+2 (t) = kAINLRM(t)\nN\u0307Fac(t) = kFacNCs+2 (t)\u2212 kradNFac(t),\n(3)\nwhere NLRM(t), NCs+2 (t), and NFac(t) are the number of LRMs, Cs+2 ions, and facilitated atoms present at time t, respectively. kPA, kAI, krad, and kFac are the rates for photoassociation, autoionization, radiative decay, and ion facilitation, respectively. I(t) is a step function used to implement the length of the photoassociation pulse with respect to the total sequence described in the caption of Figure 6.\nThe model succeeds in describing the dynamics at all short-lived resonances, except for the spectral feature at \u221226.4 MHz where several resonances with different formation and decay rates overlap. We thus focus in the following on the facilitation dynamics for short-lived LRMs. The model allows us to extract the number of remaining LRMs present in the system at every point in time, as depicted by the green model curves in Figure 6. It becomes apparent that, at the end of the PA pulse, for nearly all of the observed molecular resonances only a small fraction of the detected PFI signals can be attributed to LRMs, while the major part of the signal originates from PFI of isolated Rydberg atoms in the state 40 2P3/2, excited via ion facilitation. This is in excellent agreement with the interpretation of the data from RF spectroscopy given above, and is further evidence for the contribution of mechanism B\u2217 to the detection of LRMs by PFI.\nThe dependence of the facilitation rate kFac on the principal quantum number n and the binding energy of\nthe LRM, i.e., on the detuning of the UV laser from the atomic transition can be estimated from the Stark shift of the atomic transition generated by the electric field of the ion. For small Stark shifts and a homogeneous gas of ground-state atoms, the facilitation rate is proportional to the volume of a facilitation shell in which the photoassociation laser is in resonance with the Starkshifted atomic transition. As shown in Figure 2, the radius of a facilitation shell depends on the laser detuning because of the inhomogeneous field created by the ion. We note that higher-order multipole moments of the ion\u2019s charge distribution contribute to the Stark shift and that the distance dependence of the Stark shift thus deviates from the 1/R4-scaling one would expect for a homogeneous field of strength F = 1/R4 (in atomic units) at the position of a ground-state atom [16, 17]. To gain fundamental insight and develop a simple model, however, we nevertheless approximate the Stark shift by the expression (1/2)\u03b1nlj\u2126R\n\u22124, where \u03b1nlj\u2126 is a Rydberg-statedependent, effective dipole polarizability. For a laser frequency red detuned from the atomic asymptote with \u03b4 = \u2206E/h one therefore finds the mean radius of the\nfacilitation shell RFac = (\u03b1nlj\u2126\n2\u2206E\n)1/4 . The width \u03b4R of the\nfacilitation shell is determined by the excitation bandwidth \u03b4E as \u03b4R = |\u2202RFac\u2202\u2206E |\u03b4E (see Figure 2). The volume of the facilitation shell, and thus the facilitation rate,\n6\nthen scales as\nkFac \u221d VFac \u221d \u03b1\n3/4 nlj\u2126\n\u2206E7/4 . (4)\nBecause of the general n-scaling of the polarizability \u03b1 \u221d n7 and the binding energy of LRMs \u2206E \u221d n\u22126, this results in an approximate n-scaling of the facilitation volume as Vfac \u221d n63/4 \u223c n16. For the parameters of the measurement depicted in Figure 6 and a ground-state atom density of ngs = 1\u00d7 1011 cm\u22123, at every instant of time a few ground-state atoms reside within the facilitation volume, justifying the use of the rate-equation model (3). Based on the strong scaling of the facilitation volume, and accordingly the effective facilitation rate, with the principal quantum number n, we expect that mechanism B\u2217 is of general importance in the photoassociation of LRMs at large values of n whenever LRMs decay to ionic products in the presence of the photoassociation light and the correlated atomic asymptote experiences a Stark shift to lower frequencies (e.g., the n 2P and n 2S low-l Rydberg series of the alkali atoms).\nIn Figure 7, the facilitation rates kFac, extracted from data sets similar to the ones shown in Figure 6 for all resonances in Figure 3 and the analysis of a similar data set from measurements at 31 2P3/2, are shown as a function of the detuning of the photoassociation laser from the atomic transition. To eliminate differences in polarizability and experimental conditions between the two measurements, the facilitation rates of 31 2P3/2 and 40\n2P3/2 are plotted against a normalized detuning \u03b4/\u2206Fac. \u2206Fac was determined separately for the two values of n by a\nweighted fit of Equation (4) to the data and choosing \u2206Fac such that at a detuning \u03b4 = \u2206Fac the facilitation rate would be 1 MHz. The gray curve in Figure 7 is an independent fit of the power law kFac \u221d \u03b4\u22127/4 to the combined data sets, which captures the observed dependence well."

The extracted rates for ionfacilitated excitation of ground state atoms were found to be consistent with the scaling expected from simple arguments based on the Stark-shift of Rydberg states and the pair-distance distribution in a thermal gas.\nWhile we have focused our study on long-range Rydberg molecules bound below n 2P3/2 Rydberg states of cesium (n = 31, 40), we expect our results to be applicable to many other systems. The requirements for the observation of mechanism B\u2217 are: a) photoassociation below a transition to an atomic Rydberg state with a negative Stark-shift, which includes the n 2P and n 2S low-l Rydberg series of the alkali atoms, and b) the decay of the formed LRM during the photoassociation pulse, yielding an ionic product, which was observed in many previous experiments [8, 9, 15, 33]. We note that our results might be of importance for the interpretation of previous experimental observations, such as surprisingly large probabilities for the formation of LRMs in thermal gases, where the ion-facilitation mechanism B\u2217 might have caused an enhancement of the number of apparently detected LRMs [34]."
