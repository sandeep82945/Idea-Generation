    "abstractText": "The relationship between firm performance feedback and technology innovation has been studied extensively, but limited attention has been paid to factors that mediate this relationship. We examine how a parent firm addresses an affiliate\u2019s performance level and its influence on the affiliate\u2019s technology innovation. Integrating the behavioral theory of the firm and the concept of parent functions, we argue that the parent firm addresses the affiliate\u2019s performance level in two ways: hierarchy management and resource allocation. Specifically, unlike the case of outperforming affiliates, the parent firm facilitates the technology innovation of underperforming affiliates through hierarchy management and resource allocation. Regression analyses of 2010\u20132020 data of listed affiliates belonging to Chinese business groups provide strong evidence supporting our conjecture. Our study sheds light on the importance of considering the parent\u2019s influence when affiliates adopt technology innovation in light of its performance feedback.",

We\u00a0 examine how a parent firm\naddresses an affiliate\u2019s performance level and its influence on the affiliate\u2019s\ntechnology innovation. Integrating the behavioral theory of the firm and the\nconcept of parent functions, we\u00a0 argue that the parent firm addresses the\naffiliate\u2019s performance level in two ways: hierarchy management and resource\nallocation. Specifically, unlike the case of outperforming affiliates, the parent\nfirm facilitates the technology innovation of underperforming affiliates\nthrough hierarchy management and resource allocation. Regression analyses\nof 2010\u20132020 data of listed affiliates belonging to Chinese business groups\nprovide strong evidence supporting our conjecture. Our study sheds light on\nthe importance of considering the parent\u2019s influence when affiliates adopt\ntechnology innovation in light of its performance feedback.\nKEYWORDS\nperformance feedback, parent functions, technology innovation, hierarchy management, resource allocation\nIntroduction\nBased on the behavioral theory of the firm (BTOF; Cyert and March, 1963; Argote and Greve, 2007), performance feedback has a significant influence on a firm\u2019s technology innovation (Greve, 2003; Chen and Miller, 2007; Bromiley and Washburn, 2011; Ye et\u00a0al., 2021). However, unlike stand-alone firms, affiliated firms need to consider the influence of their parent firm (Vissa et\u00a0al., 2010; Gaba and Joseph, 2013; Joseph et\u00a0al., 2016; Sengul and Obloj, 2017; Dutt and Joseph, 2019; Rhee et\u00a0al., 2019). An affiliate\u2019s performance level impacts the business group\u2019s welfare, and the parent firm, as the ultimate shareholder, is motivated to guide the affiliate\u2019s technology innovation (Vissa et\u00a0al., 2010; Rhee et\u00a0al., 2019). Prior studies have focused mainly on the direct correlation between performance feedback and technology innovation (Greve, 2003; Chen and Miller, 2007; Bromiley and Washburn, 2011; Ye et\u00a0al., 2021), devoting limited attention to how the parent firm addresses the affiliate\u2019s performance level and how this contributes to the affiliate\u2019s technology innovation.\nTYPE Original Research PUBLISHED 25 January 2023 DOI 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.1056867"

Some scholars argued that affiliates can improve their innovative capabilities by conforming with their parent firm\u2019s strategies (Hu et\u00a0al., 2019; Zheng et\u00a0al., 2022), while others contended that parent functions constrain the affiliate\u2019s technology innovation (Asakawa et\u00a0 al., 2018; Wang and Wang, 2021). In essence, the debate is about how parent functions influence the affiliate\u2019s strategic decisions. Drawing on the BTOF, we\u00a0surmise that the affiliate\u2019s performance level significantly impacts the business group\u2019s welfare, and the parent firm tends to take measures to guide the affiliate\u2019s decision-making (Sengul and Obloj, 2017; Sengul et\u00a0al., 2019) to ensure alignment with the group\u2019s aspirations. We\u00a0focus particularly on two crucial parent functions: hierarchy management and resource allocation (Meyer et\u00a0 al., 2020), and examine the mediating effect of parent functions on the relationship between the affiliate\u2019s performance feedback and technology innovation, to reveal how the parent firm\u2019s approach to address the affiliate\u2019s performance level impacts the affiliate\u2019s technology innovation.\nThis paper contributes to the literature in several ways. Firstly, it offers a novel perspective on the research regarding the BTOF. Prior studies have shown that performance feedback significantly impacts technology innovation (Greve, 2003; Chen and Miller, 2007; Bromiley and Washburn, 2011; Ye et\u00a0al., 2021), but the underlying mechanisms in this relationship remain underexplored. The gap limits our understanding of how performance feedback impacts technology innovation. In this study, we\u00a0combine the BTOF and the concept of parent functions to clarify the influencing mechanisms of parent functions on the technology innovation of affiliates with different performance levels, thereby extending the BTOF research.\nSecondly, we\u00a0identify the ways a parent firm responds to its affiliate\u2019s performance level. We\u00a0focus on two parent functions: hierarchy management and resource allocation and find that the changes in parent functions are contingent upon the affiliate performance feedback. Our study contributes to the understanding of parent functions by providing a behavioral account on affiliate performance feedback.\nThirdly, we\u00a0 uncover the underlying mechanisms in the relationship between affiliate performance feedback and technology innovation. Our study depicts how the parent firm responds to the affiliate\u2019s performance level and its influence on the affiliate\u2019s technology innovation, thus advancing parent function research by clarifying the contingency factors that promote or impede affiliates\u2019 technology innovation. We\u00a0also provide some suggestions for the parent firm to guide its affiliates\u2019 technology innovation."

            "text": "Affiliate performance feedback and parent firm\u2019s attention\nTo investigate how a parent firm addresses an affiliate\u2019s performance level, we\u00a0apply the BTOF (Cyert and March, 1963;\nArgote and Greve, 2007). The core of the BTOF is that firms\u2019 risk decisions are subject to the comparison between firm performance and its aspired level (Cyert and March, 1963; Greve, 2003). A firm sets its aspired performance level or target as a reference point for evaluating its performance, and treats it as the benchmark for whether firm performance is satisfactory (Cyert and March, 1963; Argote and Greve, 2007). If firm performance is above the aspired level (receiving positive performance feedback), the firm is satisfied with its returns and has less motivation to engage in risky decisions (Greve, 2003; Hoskisson et\u00a0 al., 2017). If firm performance is below the aspired level (receiving negative performance feedback), the firm\u2019s routines are not well suited for the external market, which prompts the firm\u2019s search for solutions (Cyert and March, 1963; Greve, 2003; Choi et\u00a0al., 2019). In this scenario, some level of risk-taking is necessary for the firm to attain its aspired level (Hoskisson et\u00a0al., 2017; Posen et\u00a0al., 2018; Li and Vermeulen, 2021).\nAttention refers to \u201cthe noticing, encoding, interpreting, and focusing of time and effort by organizational decision-makers\u201d (Ocasio, 1997, p.189). Identifying the driving factors of attention distribution helps in exploring the influence of parent functions, as the parent firm guides affiliates\u2019 strategic decisions according to its level of attention (Belenzon et\u00a0al., 2019; Dutt and Joseph, 2019; Rhee et\u00a0al., 2019; Bekmezci et\u00a0al., 2022; Busenbark et\u00a0al., 2022). Owing to bounded rationality (Simon, 1947), the attention capability is limited and the parent firm cannot similarly focus on all affiliates (Dutt and Joseph, 2019; Rhee et\u00a0al., 2019; Eklund and Mannor, 2021). The performance level of the affiliate improves or damages the business group\u2019s welfare (Jia et\u00a0al., 2013; Joseph et\u00a0al., 2016; Rhee et\u00a0al., 2019), and the parent firm can distribute its attention among affiliates according to the affiliate\u2019s performance level."

            "text": "The influence of the parent firm on its affiliates mainly refers to the managerial activities related to the formulation and implementation of affiliate strategies and operational activities that involve resource allocation and utilization to prompt the development of affiliates (Meyer et\u00a0al., 2020). Many scholars have proposed that such activities for synergy management and resource sharing are the key functions of parent firms (Poppo, 2003; Belenzon et\u00a0 al., 2019). Considering this proposition, we\u00a0conjecture that parent functions are manifested in two ways: hierarchy management and resource allocation.\nCompared with affiliates, parent firms have greater prior knowledge and resources (Nell and Ambos, 2013; Zeng et\u00a0al., 2018). To some extent, hierarchy management can prompt affiliates\u2019 technology innovation (Ciabuschi et\u00a0al., 2011; Palmi\u00e9 et\u00a0al., 2016; Mahmood et\u00a0al., 2017; Beugelsdijk and Jindra, 2018), as the parent firm provides some guidance and valuable resources to its affiliates (Raab et\u00a0al., 2014; Zeng et\u00a0al., 2018). However, hierarchy management\nFrontiers in Psychology 03 frontiersin.org\nis notably not always efficient. Some scholars have shown that parent firms lack sufficient knowledge and understanding of their affiliates\u2019 activities owing to limited attention spans (Goold et\u00a0al., 1998), and centralization leads to the affiliates\u2019 limited development (Asakawa et\u00a0al., 2018; Geleilate et\u00a0al., 2020; Wang and Wang, 2021). Hence, how the parent firm manages its affiliates efficiently is a key issue.\nResource allocation within the business group\nResource allocation among affiliates is one of the most essential functions of the parent firm (Belenzon et\u00a0al., 2019; Sengul et\u00a0al., 2019; Busenbark et\u00a0al., 2022). The existing literature on resource allocation presents two views: winner picking and co-insurance. Winner picking theory holds that resource allocation is prioritized for outperforming affiliates to strengthen the core advantage (Williamson, 1975; Tan et\u00a0al., 2018; Sengul et\u00a0al., 2019; Lovallo et\u00a0al., 2020), while co-insurance theory suggests that resource allocation is prioritized for underperforming affiliates to relieve operational risks (Jia et\u00a0al., 2013; Busenbark et\u00a0al., 2022). Regarding resource allocation, it is generally believed that outperforming affiliates that contribute more to the business group deserve more resources in return (Arrfelt et\u00a0al., 2015). Why resources are not allocated in proportion to affiliates\u2019 performance level is a puzzling question."

            "text": "Affiliate performance feedback and hierarchy management\nThe affiliates\u2019 performance level not only directly impacts the business group\u2019s interest but also their responses to performance feedback affect the group development (Arrfelt et\u00a0al., 2015; Sengul and Obloj, 2017). To ensure that affiliates\u2019 strategic decisions are aligned with the business group\u2019s aspiration, the parent firm is motivated to guide its affiliates\u2019 decision-making through hierarchical management (Sengul and Obloj, 2017). Considering the advantages and disadvantages of hierarchy management (Raab et\u00a0al., 2014; Palmi\u00e9 et\u00a0al., 2016; Asakawa et\u00a0al., 2018; Beugelsdijk and Jindra, 2018; Wang and Wang, 2021), we\u00a0propose that the parent firm should adjust the hierarchy management according to the affiliate performance feedback and its possible responses.\nThe performance feedback of an affiliate affects the attention distribution of its parent firm. A performance level that is above the aspired level indicates that the affiliate has obtained a satisfactory return (Cyert and March, 1963; Argote and Greve, 2007). Simultaneously, the parent firm benefits from its ownership. As a response, it tends to pay less attention to such affiliates because the affiliate\u2019s development is good (Sengul and Obloj, 2017). A negative performance feedback demonstrates that the affiliate has not realized its aspired level (Cyert and March, 1963; Argote and Greve, 2007), and the benefits for the business group decrease. In this scenario, the\nparent firm will pay more attention to such an affiliate to search for the problems and corresponding solutions (Meyer et\u00a0 al., 2020). Hence, compared with outperforming affiliates, underperforming affiliates attract more attention from the parent firm.\nThe hierarchy management depends on how the affiliates respond to the performance feedback. According to the BTOF, outperforming affiliates have a lower risk tolerance and tend to maintain the status quo (Hoskisson et\u00a0al., 2017; Li and Vermeulen, 2021). The parent firm supports such affiliates\u2019 decisions because of the satisfactory returns from these affiliates. The practice of strategic consistency allows the parent firm to appropriate a lower level of hierarchical management on these outperforming affiliates (Sengul and Obloj, 2017). Affiliates receiving a negative performance feedback have a higher risk tolerance and become more risk-seeking to achieve their aspired level (Hoskisson et\u00a0al., 2017). Although risky decisions are critical for affiliates to improve their current situation, this may be\u00a0 accompanied by lower economic returns with a higher performance variance (Bowman, 1980; Henkel, 2009; Li and Vermeulen, 2021), which would further damage the business group\u2019s welfare. Even if the parent firm makes repairs afterward, it cannot compensate for the loss caused by the affiliate\u2019s decision-making (Sengul and Obloj, 2017). Hence, to guide the affiliate\u2019s decision-making and maintain the group\u2019s stable development, the parent firm would strengthen the hierarchy management on the underperforming affiliates.\nTaken together, based on whether an affiliate realizes its aspired performance level and whether it engages in risky decisions, the parent firm decreases the level of hierarchy management on outperforming affiliates and increases that on underperforming affiliates.\nHypothesis 1a. A negative feedback on an affiliate\u2019s performance is positively correlated with hierarchy management. Hypothesis 1b. A positive feedback on an affiliate\u2019s performance is negatively correlated with hierarchy management.\nAffiliate performance feedback and resource allocation\nHow to allocate resources within a business group is the parent firm\u2019s responsibility, which covers all affiliates (Belenzon et\u00a0al., 2019; Sengul et\u00a0al., 2019; Busenbark et\u00a0al., 2022). Owing to bounded rationality (Simon, 1947), the parent firm does not have sufficient time and knowledge to assess the value of its affiliates in all dimensions; thus, it focuses its attention on a limited set of variables such as performance (Arrfelt et\u00a0al., 2013; Bardolet et\u00a0al., 2017). Given that the affiliate\u2019s performance level and its corresponding response impacts the business group\u2019s welfare, the parent firm can influence the affiliate\u2019s decision-making through resource allocation (Arrfelt et\u00a0al., 2013; Jia et\u00a0al., 2013; Dou et\u00a0al., 2021). Hence, we\u00a0propose that the resource allocation criteria depends on the affiliate performance feedback.\nFrontiers in Psychology 04 frontiersin.org\nWhen an affiliate\u2019s performance is above the aspired level, both the parent firm and affiliate are satisfied with the returns, and they tend to maintain the status quo (Hoskisson et\u00a0al., 2017; Li and Vermeulen, 2021). Accordingly, it is not necessary for the parent firm to allocate resources to support the affiliate\u2019s risky decisions. When an affiliate\u2019s performance is below the aspired level, both the parent firm and affiliate become motivated to reach the aspired level through risky decisions. Considering the resource constraints of underperforming affiliates, the parent firm can allocate more resources to them (Arrfelt et\u00a0al., 2013; Tan et\u00a0al., 2018; Dou et\u00a0al., 2021). Hence, the BTOF can shed light on why resource allocation deviates from the winner-picking approach based on the performance feedback and possible response of the affiliate.\nMoreover, the internal transaction relationships among affiliates promote the response of resource allocation to the affiliate performance feedback (Jia et\u00a0 al., 2013). The business group\u2019s competitive advantage is mainly reflected in knowledge sharing, technology transfer, and capital flow across the affiliates (Khanna and Yafeh, 2007; Hu et\u00a0 al., 2019), and the relationship between affiliates can become closer. Unlike the case of outperforming affiliates, the operating problems exposed by the underperforming affiliates may impede other affiliates\u2019 development initiatives through the cooperation channels (Keum, 2020). To avoid the risk contagion, other affiliates tend to support the underperforming affiliates by way of resource allocation. Consequently, the business group resources are transferred from the outperforming to the underperforming affiliates (Bardolet et\u00a0al., 2017; Busenbark et\u00a0al., 2022).\nTaken together, based on the resource demands of the underperforming affiliates and the risk contagion aversion of outperforming affiliates, the principle of resource allocation within the business group follows the co-insurance theory. Hence, more resources are allocated to underperforming affiliates and less resources to outperforming affiliates.\nHypothesis 2a. A negative feedback on an affiliate\u2019s performance is positively correlated with resource allocation. Hypothesis 2b. A positive feedback on an affiliate\u2019s performance is negatively correlated with resource allocation.\nThe mediating influence of hierarchy management on the relationship between the affiliate performance feedback and technology innovation\nThe parent firm generally possesses advanced knowledge and information (Nell and Ambos, 2013; Feldman, 2021), which can be\u00a0transferred to its affiliates through the hierarchy management (Beugelsdijk and Jindra, 2018; Zeng et\u00a0al., 2018). Considering the managerial involvement is not always efficient (Asakawa et\u00a0al., 2018; Wang and Wang, 2021), the parent firm can adjust the level of hierarchy management based on the affiliate performance feedback.\nWhen an affiliate\u2019s performance is below its aspired level, both the parent firm and affiliate become motivated to seek potential\nsolutions to reach the aspired level. Technology innovation may allow underperforming affiliates to deal with the performance issues by improving its market competitiveness (Greve, 2003; Saemundsson et\u00a0al., 2022). However, innovation may be\u00a0fraught with risks and uncertainties (Li and Vermeulen, 2021; Dean et\u00a0al., 2022). Underperforming affiliates have a higher risk tolerance, as they do not have much to lose (Lim, 2019). In this scenario, the technology innovation may lead to lower economic returns with a higher variance (Bowman, 1980; Henkel, 2009; Li and Vermeulen, 2021), further exacerbating performance shortfalls. To reduce the innovation risk, the parent firm tends to guide the technology innovation of underperforming affiliates through a stronger hierarchical management. Hence, the hierarchy management as a response to the negative performance feedback of an affiliate can prompt the affiliate\u2019s technology innovation.\nWhen the affiliate\u2019s performance is above its aspired level, both the parent firm and affiliate are satisfied with the returns and have less motivation to pursue an innovation strategy (Cyert and March, 1963; Greve, 2003; Argote and Greve, 2007). In this scenario, the parent firm should reduce the level of hierarchy management to avoid the inefficiency of attention focus (Sengul and Obloj, 2017; Eklund and Mannor, 2021). The reduced hierarchy management makes the operation of the affiliates similar to that of stand-alone firms, and finally, the outperforming affiliates present weak motivation to pursue the technology innovation.\nTaken together, the influence of hierarchy management on affiliate\u2019s technology innovation varies with the affiliate performance feedback. Specifically, a strong hierarchical management is convenient for guiding underperforming affiliates\u2019 technology innovation, and a reduced level of hierarchical management leads to less technology innovation for outperforming affiliates.\nHypothesis 3a. A higher level of hierarchical management of underperforming affiliates facilitates the affiliate\u2019s technology innovation. Hypothesis 3b. A lower level of hierarchical management of outperforming affiliates impedes the affiliate\u2019s technology innovation.\nThe mediating influence of resource allocation on the relationship between the affiliate performance feedback and technology innovation\nThe business group can provide valuable resources such as knowledge, capital, and information, which are hard to obtain from external markets (Chang et\u00a0al., 2006; Khanna and Yafeh, 2007; Dou et\u00a0al., 2021). To ensure that resources are allocated efficiently, the parent firm should take the resource needs of affiliates with different performance feedbacks into account.\nWhen an affiliate\u2019s performance is below its aspired level, both the parent firm and affiliate tend to employ technology innovation to solve the problem (Rhee et\u00a0 al., 2019). However, technology\nFrontiers in Psychology 05 frontiersin.org\ninnovation requires a huge amount of resources. The performance shortfall reduces the total resources of affiliates and inhibits the innovation decision (Smulowitz et\u00a0al., 2020). In this scenario, the parent firm can allocate more resources to support them. Hence, underperforming affiliates can pursue technology innovation in the context that resource constraints are alleviated through the resource allocation within the business group (Belenzon and Berkovitz, 2010; Arrfelt et\u00a0al., 2013; Tan et\u00a0al., 2018; Dou et\u00a0al., 2021).\nWhen an affiliate\u2019s performance is above its aspired level, both the parent firm and affiliate are satisfied with the returns and have less motivation to invest in technology innovation (Greve, 2003). Meanwhile, receiving a positive performance feedback brings more resources to an affiliate. To ensure that these slack resources are efficiently used, the parent firm can transfer these resources to other affiliates that need them (Bardolet et\u00a0al., 2017). Consequently, the reduced resources constrain the technology innovation of outperforming affiliates.\nTaken together, the way resource allocation is carried out has a significant mediating effect on the relationship between the performance feedback and technology innovation of affiliates. Specifically, the parent firm allocates more resources to the underperforming affiliates to support their technology innovation, while less resources are assigned to the outperforming affiliates who have a lower motivation for innovation.\nHypothesis 4a. The increased resource allocation prompts the technology innovation of underperforming affiliates. Hypothesis 4b. The decreased resource allocation impedes the technology innovation of outperforming affiliates.\nBased on above hypotheses, the conceptual framework of this paper is shown in the Figure\u00a01."

By contrast, the performance feedback based on historical aspirations is less ambiguous, and thus can better guide a firm to make an objective response. Hence, we\u00a0employ the historical aspiration to measure the performance feedback. Historical aspiration is often defined as follows: At\u00a0 = \ud835\udefcPt\u20131 + (1 \u2212 \ud835\udefc)At\u20131. Referring to Kuusela et\u00a0 al.

Based on the knots at the extreme values and zero, the spline function of ROA-historical aspiration creates two separate variables: ROA-historical aspiration >0, and ROA-historical aspiration <0.

Since technology innovation has a significant relationship with R&D expenditure, we\u00a0include the affiliate\u2019s R&D, measured by the ratio of R&D expenditure to operating income (Zheng et\u00a0al., 2022). To control for differences between young and old affiliates, we\u00a0include the affiliate\u2019s age, measured by the natural logarithm of its founding year. To control for differences between small and large affiliates, we\u00a0 include the affiliate\u2019s size, measured by the natural logarithm of the affiliate\u2019s total assets (Vissa et\u00a0al., 2010). As technology innovation requires a huge amount of resources, and the resources possessed by affiliates affect their technology innovation, we\u00a0include slack resources (Slack), measured by the current assets divided by current liabilities (Chen and Miller, 2007; Arrfelt et\u00a0al., 2013). We\u00a0also control for the asset-liability ratio (Leverage; measured by the ratio of the total debt to assets), as it affects the affiliate\u2019s financial ability to pursue innovation (Zhang et\u00a0 al., 2022). Bankruptcy risk may impact an affiliate\u2019s innovation because of operational and financial trouble, and the Altman\u2019s (1983) Z-score indicates a firm\u2019s distance from bankruptcy. A lower score shows that a firm is on the verge of bankruptcy (Chen and Miller, 2007).\nWe also include some variables characterizing the interaction between affiliates and the parent firm. We\u00a0control for the property attribute (State)\u2014if the firm is affiliated to a state-owned business group, we\u00a0assign it a value of one, and zero otherwise (Zheng et\u00a0al., 2022). Moreover, the position of an affiliate in the pyramidal ownership structure influences its relationship with the parent firm (Belenzon et\u00a0 al., 2019), which impacts the affiliate\u2019s innovation (Zheng et\u00a0al., 2022). Hence, we\u00a0include the control level, measured by one plus the number of firms in the middle between the affiliate and parent firm. Because the equity ratio impacts the degree of the parent firm\u2019s control and management of the affiliate\u2019s technology innovation (Mahmood et\u00a0al., 2017; Feldman, 2021), we\u00a0 include ownership, measured by the ownership ratio of the parent firm in the affiliate. The degree of the parent firm\u2019s involvement in the affiliate\u2019s technology innovation is affected by other shareholders. We\u00a0include equity restriction, measured by the ratio of ownership of the parent firm to the ownership that remains after subtracting the parent firm\u2019s ownership from the equity of the top\u00a010 shareholders.

Model 2 examines the direct effect of the affiliate performance feedback on technology innovation. Model 3 verifies how the parent responds, through its level of hierarchical management, to the affiliate\u2019s performance level. Model 4 tests the influence of the affiliate performance feedback on the resource allocation within the business group.\nModel 5 investigates the mediating effect of the parent\u2019s hierarchy management on the relationship between the affiliate performance feedback and technology innovation. Model 6 explores the mediating effect of resource allocation on the relationship between the affiliate performance feedback and technology innovation.\nFrontiers in Psychology 09 frontiersin.org\nThe empirical results of the control variables in Model 1 show that R&D expenditure and size have a positive correlation with the affiliate\u2019s technology innovation; equity and slack have an adverse effect on the affiliate\u2019s technology innovation, and state-owned affiliates have a higher innovation capability compared with private-owned ones. The level of significance indicates that the chosen control variables are relatively effective.\nBased on the BTOF, the performance feedback has a significant impact on technology innovation (Greve, 2003; Chen and Miller, 2007; Bromiley and Washburn, 2011; Ye et\u00a0al., 2021). The results of Model 2 support this theory. Specifically, the coefficient of a negative performance feedback is positive and significant (\u03b1 = 1.663, p < 0.01), while the coefficient of a positive performance feedback is negative and significant (\u03b1 = \u22120.965, p < 0.05), demonstrating that receiving a negative performance feedback facilitates the affiliate\u2019s technology innovation, while receiving a positive performance feedback inhibits it. Model 2 shows that the technology innovation varies with the performance feedback.\nHypothesis 1a predicts that the parent firm will strengthen its hierarchical management on underperforming affiliates. In line with this hypothesis, the coefficient of a negative performance feedback in Model 3 is significant and positive (\u03b1 = 0.125, p < 0.05). Hypothesis 1b proposes that the parent firm will reduce its degree of hierarchical management of outperforming affiliates. The empirical result shows that the coefficient of a positive performance feedback is significant and negative (\u03b1 = \u22120.204, p < 0.01), supporting our conjecture. Model 3 shows that the parent firm should consider the affiliates\u2019 performance level when adjusting its hierarchical management of these affiliates.\nHypothesis 2a proposes that a business group\u2019s resources are allocated to support the underperforming affiliates. The empirical results of Model 4 show that the coefficient of a negative performance feedback is significant and positive (\u03b1 = 1.038, p < 0.01). Hypothesis 2b predicts that the resource allocation will reduce the amount of resources possessed by the outperforming affiliates. Consistent with the hypothesis, the coefficient of a positive performance feedback is significant and negative (\u03b1 = \u22120.547, p < 0.1). Model 4 shows that the parent firm allocates resources across affiliates following the co-insurance theory; the parent firm allocates more resources to underperforming affiliates and less resources to outperforming ones.\nHypothesis 3a predicts that a stronger hierarchical management of an underperforming affiliate facilitates its technology innovation. Integrating models 2 and 3, the empirical results of model 4 show that the coefficient of hierarchy management is significant and positive (\u03b1 = 0.230, p < 0.05); the coefficient of a negative performance feedback is significant and positive (\u03b1 = 1.635, p < 0.01), but it is lower than the coefficient in model 2 (1.635 < 1.663), thus supporting our hypothesis. Hypothesis 3b predicts that the reduced hierarchy management will impede the outperforming affiliate\u2019s technology innovation. As model 4 shows, the coefficient of a positive performance feedback is significant and negative\n(\u03b1 = \u22120.918, p < 0.1), and the absolute value of the coefficient is lower compared with the coefficient in model 2 (0.918 < 0.965). Hypothesis 3b is thus verified. However, the mediating effect of hierarchy management is notably weak and unstable when the affiliate\u2019s performance is above its aspired level. The results of model 4 suggest that affiliates, especially the underperforming ones, should consider taking advantage of the parent firm\u2019s hierarchical management when employing technology innovation to respond to a negative performance feedback.\nHypothesis 4a predicts that the increased resource allocation will prompt the technology innovation of underperforming affiliates. Integrating models 2 and 3, the empirical results of model 4 show that the coefficient of resource allocation is significant and positive (\u03b1 = 0.051, p < 0.05); the coefficient of a negative performance feedback is significant and positive (\u03b1 = 1.610, p < 0.01), but it is lower than the coefficient in model 2 (1.610 < 1.663), thus supporting our conjecture. Hypothesis 4b predicts that the decreased resource allocation will inhibit the technology innovation of outperforming affiliates. The coefficient of an affiliate\u2019s positive performance feedback is significant and negative (\u03b1 = \u22120.938, p < 0.1), and the absolute value of the coefficient is lower compared with the coefficient in model 2 (0.938 < 0.965). Hypothesis 4b is thus verified. The results of model 6 show that the resource allocation diversely impacts the technology innovation of affiliates who have different performance levels."

            "text": "We subject the results to several robustness tests. First, we\u00a0employ a bootstrapping approach to test for the mediating effect of parent functions (Hayes, 2017). Based on bootstrapping procedures with 500 resamples, the results in Table\u00a03 show that the indirect effect of an affiliate\u2019s negative performance feedback on its technology innovation through parent functions (hierarchy management and resource allocation) is significant. Moreover, the bias-corrected 95% confidence interval (CI) does not contain zero. Thus, hypotheses 3a and 4a are supported.\nSecond, we\u00a0verify the nonlinear effect of the performance feedback on technology innovation. We\u00a0add a new variable, which is the remainder after subtracting the ROA from the historical aspiration (HROA), and the square of the variable (HROA2) to our models. As Table\u00a04 shows, the closer the performance is to the aspired level, the more motivated an affiliate is to engage in technology innovation; the intensity of the parent\u2019s hierarchical management and resource allocation exert mediating effects on the U-shaped relationship between the affiliate performance feedback and technology innovation. The empirical results of Table\u00a04 support the conjecture that the technology innovation varies with the performance feedback.\nThird, we\u00a0verify our results using an alternative aspiration level. The referents of aspiration levels often consist of historical and peer performance. Peer aspiration refers to the average of peer performance (Ye et\u00a0 al., 2021). The performance feedback is\nFrontiers in Psychology 10 frontiersin.org\nmeasured by the comparison between that of an affiliate and its peer. The empirical results (in Table\u00a05) support the mediating effects of parent functions (hierarchy management and resource allocation) on the relationship between an affiliate\u2019s negative performance feedback and its technology innovation. However, the affiliate\u2019s positive performance feedback promotes technology innovation, and the relationship with the parent firm\u2019s response is not significant. The difference between historical and peer aspirations is mainly reflected in the affiliate\u2019s positive performance feedback.\nFourth, we\u00a0 verify our results using alternative hierarchy management and resource allocation variables. As the parent firm can intervene in the appointment of the affiliate\u2019s executives to ensure the implementation of technology innovation, we\u00a0measure the hierarchy management variable as the ratio of the number of affiliate directors and executives who are working concurrently in the parent firm to the size of the affiliate\u2019s board and executive group. Capital allocation is the core of resource allocation (Chang et\u00a0 al., 2006; Arrfelt et\u00a0 al., 2015); affiliates can reduce their bankruptcy risk through co-insurance (Jia et\u00a0 al., 2013). Here, capital allocation is measured by the ratio of capital change to income. The empirical results (in Table\u00a06) support the mediating effect of resource allocation after substituting the variables. We\u00a0surmise that the intervention of affiliate executives may overly restrict the flexibility of affiliates, which has an adverse impact on technology innovation.\nMoreover, we\u00a0employ \ud835\udefc=0.6, \ud835\udefc=0.5 to measure the historical aspiration. The empirical results show that the mediating effect of parent functions is more robust when the affiliate\u2019s performance is below the aspired level."

Using\n2010\u20132020 data of listed affiliates belonging to Chinese business groups, we\u00a0 propose that a negative performance feedback facilitates an affiliate\u2019s technology innovation, while a positive performance feedback inhibits it. Because an affiliate\u2019s performance feedback and technology innovation impact the business group\u2019s welfare, the parent firm tends to respond accordingly through its functions. We\u00a0 focus on the following parent functions: hierarchy management and resource allocation, and find that, the parent firm strengthens its hierarchical management and allocates more resources to the underperforming affiliates to support their technology innovation and reduces its hierarchical management and resource allocation to outperforming affiliates that are reluctant to engage in technology innovation. Hence, the technology innovation of an underperforming affiliate is subject to parent functions more so than that of outperforming affiliates."

            "text": "We investigate the mediating effect of parent functions on the relationship between the affiliate performance feedback and technology innovation. Some practical implications for the affiliates and parent firms are provided.\nFirst, we\u00a0propose that whether affiliates engage in technology innovation depends on its performance feedback. When the performance achieves the aspired level, the affiliate is less motivated to engage in technology innovation. Otherwise, the affiliate can reach the aspired level through technology innovation. Our results are consistent with the view of most research on the BTOF (Greve, 2003; Choi et\u00a0al., 2019; Cheng et\u00a0al., 2022).\nSecond, we\u00a0recommend the parent firm to adjust the intensity of its hierarchical management on its affiliates based on the affiliate performance feedback. Recent literature mainly focuses on the impact of board (Choi et\u00a0al., 2019; Cheng et\u00a0al., 2022) and top managers (Schumacher et\u00a0al., 2020; Saemundsson et\u00a0al., 2022) on the relationship between firm underperforming and risky decisions, devoting limited attention to the influence of the controlling\nTABLE\u00a03 Results of the bootstrap test for the mediating effect of the parent\u2019s response.\nTotal and specific indirect effect Coeff SE Bootstrapping BC 95% CI\nLower Upper\nNegative performance feedback-technology innovation of affiliation\nSum of indirect effect 1.663 0.483 0.716 2.611\nSpecific indirect effect\nROAL\u00a0\u2794\u00a0Hierarchy\u00a0\u2794\u00a0Inno 1.635 0.458 0.778 2.531\nROAL\u00a0\u2794\u00a0Allocation\u00a0\u2794\u00a0Inno 1.61 0.424 0.754 2.395\nPositive performance feedback-technology innovation of affiliation\nSum of indirect effect \u22120.965 0.551 \u22122.046 0.115\nSpecific indirect effect\nROAH\u00a0\u2794\u00a0Hierarchy\u00a0\u2794\u00a0Inno \u22120.918 0.502 \u22121.866 0.049\nROAH\u00a0\u2794\u00a0Allocation\u00a0\u2794\u00a0Inno \u22120.938 0.504 \u22121.89 0.102\nFrontiers in Psychology 11 frontiersin.org\nshareholders (Vissa et\u00a0al., 2010; Joseph et\u00a0al., 2016; Rhee et\u00a0al., 2019). Compared to stand-alone firms, affiliated firms are managed by their parent firms. Considering the unclear relationship between parent management and affiliate development (Raab et\u00a0al., 2014; Palmi\u00e9 et\u00a0al., 2016; Asakawa et\u00a0al., 2018; Beugelsdijk and Jindra, 2018; Wang and Wang, 2021), we\u00a0recommend the parent firm to\nstrengthen its hierarchical management on underperforming affiliates in a way of people who are from the parent firm serving in the affiliate board, and reduce that on outperforming affiliates, based on the performance level of affiliates.\nThird, we\u00a0provide some reference on the resource allocation within a business group.

The affiliates\u2019 competitive advantages lie in the resource transferring and sharing among firms within the business group (Hu et\u00a0al., 2019; Sengul et\u00a0al., 2019). Considering the debate on the winner-picking and co-insurance theories (Jia et\u00a0al., 2013; Busenbark et\u00a0al., 2022), we\u00a0propose that the resource\nallocation should consider the innovation motivation and slack resources of affiliates.

Given that the business group is treated as a substitute for an inefficient external market, future studies can investigate the influence of parent functions on the relationship between an affiliate\u2019s performance feedback and its technology innovation under different external market contexts.\nSecond, we\u00a0recommend the parent firm to adjust the intensity of its hierarchical management to respond to the affiliate\u2019s performance feedback, but the adjustment is largely affected by the business group\u2019s ownership structure. Future studies can address the question of to what extent should a parent firm adjust its hierarchical management that in a way that is considered reasonable within its ownership scope.\nThird, we\u00a0find that the allocation of resources leads to reduced resources for outperforming affiliates, which harms the interest of other shareholders (Fan et\u00a0al., 2016). Future studies can explore how other shareholders respond to the resource allocation of the parent firm."
