    "abstractText": "We report the bactericidal effect of Ag and Cu NPs with different concentrations on methicillin-resistant S. aureus strain in comparison to the effect of AgNO3 and CuCl2 solutions, characterized by microbiological tests, TEM and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy. NPs were produced by nanosecond laser ablation in distilled water and characterized by scanning electron microscopy, UV-vis, energy dispersive X-ray, FT-IR spectroscopy, as well as X-ray diffraction, dynamic light scattering size and zeta-potential measurements. Microbiological tests showed antibacterial activity of NPs and metal ion-containing salts. Comparative FT-IR spectroscopy of bacteria, treated with metal NPs and salts, showed the broadening of amide I and II bands, a CH2-related peak and its frequency decrease, indicating the increase of membrane fluidity. The main mechanisms of the antibacterial effect were proposed: Ag and Cu NPs release ions and ROS, which result in lipid peroxidation; AgNO3 forms precipitates on the cell surface, which lead to the mechanical rupture of the membrane and subsequent possible penetration of the precipitates in the emerged damaged spots, complete destruction of the membrane and bacterial death; Cu ions from the CuCl2 solution cause damage to phosphorusand sulfur-containing biomolecules, which leads to disruption of intracellular biochemical processes. The theories were confirmed by FT-IR spectroscopy and TEM.",

            "text": "In order to enhance the growth of livestock for further meat processing, antibiotics are often added to the nutrition in small doses over long periods of time, thus preventing possible diseases and death [1,2]. Needless to say, such a deliberate waste of antibiotics has a highly negative impact on human health [3], causing dysbacteriosis and allergic reactions. Pathogenic bacteria, being in the long-term presence of antibiotics, start to adjust by gene mutations, acquiring strong resistivity to commonly used drugs [4,5]. The specter of drugs, to which bacteria have developed resistivity, is growing, and we are in need of alternative methods for antibacterial procedures. Such methods include the use of nanostructures and nanoparticles, which are affective either by direct mechanical damage to the cell membrane [6,7], or act through the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) [8,9]. Several theories have been proposed, such as the reaction of these metals with proteins by combining the -SH groups of enzymes, leading\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3857. https://doi.org/10.3390/nano12213857 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/nanomaterials\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3857 2 of 17\nto the inactivation of the proteins [10]. A recent article [11] has proposed the optimal conditions for strong antibacterial effect of Ag NPs\u2014their surface chemistry has to be controlled in order to elude aggregation and produce Ag+ ions, and its charge has to be positive to enhance the binding with bacterial cell membrane, while NP size should be 10 nm or less. Silver and copper NPs are widely known for their bactericidal action on microorganisms both in planktonic form and as durable biofilms [10\u201316]. Twelvenm Cu NPs, prepared by inert gas condensation method, were effectively used against E. coli [13]. It was observed that Cu NPs damage cells by leaving cavities in the bacterial cell wall. Moreover, silver and copper ions can be used as disinfectants for wastewater from hospitals [17,18]. Copper NPs have proved to be more effective in antibacterial therapy than silver on E. coli and Bacillus subtilis [19]. Unlike metal NPs [20,21], ion-containing solutions are used more rarely in antimicrobial applications. The formation of dense granules around the AgNO3-treated bacteria, consisting of silver and sulfur, has been previously discovered to occur [22]. The comparison of the inhibition zone diameter after treatment of pathogenic bacteria with Ag NPs and AgNO3 was also carried out, and it was found out that, for NPs, the diameters were two-times higher [23]. Cu ion-containing solutions have also been previously tested against several microorganisms. It has been suggested, that, at given concentrations, Cu interacts with cellular nucleic acids and enzyme active sites, as well as plasma membrane [24\u201329], and that treatment of microorganisms with Cu can interfere with membrane integrity, which is accompanied by leakage of mobile cellular solutes such as K+ and the subsequent cell death [25]. A two-fold increase of cellular K+ release was observed after addition of Cu(NO3)2 to Saccharomyces cerevisiae\u2014a yeast used in brewery and baking [27]. AgNO3 has been found to exhibit antimicrobial activity with a minimal inhibitory concentration of three \u00b5M against E. coli [30]. The bactericidal effect of Ag nanoparticles at millimolar levels (2\u201310 mM) has been previously studied on mesophilic and halophilic bacteria spp. such as Enterobacter, Bacillus subtilis and Marinobacter [31]. Bactericidal activity of Ag NPs has been detected at low concentrations against many bacterial strains. Guzman et al. reported bactericidal activity of Ag NPs against E. coli, S. aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa at \u223c216 ppm (parts per million) [32]. Matzke et al. found that Ag NPs inhibited Pseudomonas putida growth at 3.4 g/L concentration [33]. AgNO3 can also be used as a catalyst for the preparation of biocompatible NPs, which may then be loaded with antimicrobial agents. The synthesis of low molecular weight chitosan NPs by ionotropic gelation of depolymerized chitosan for effective drug delivery in drug resistant bacteria in the presence of silver nitrate has been reported [34]. The resulting tetracycline-loaded NPs were then successfully used for antibacterial treatment on the strain of tetracycline-resistant E. coli. The authors also used AgNO3 for synthesis of low molecular weight alginic acid NPs for effective drug delivery to drug resistant bacteria [35]. Thus, Ag- and Cu-containing agents are effective against a plethora of microorganisms, but in order to define optimal treatment one has to include such methods of characterization as FT-IR spectroscopy, which allows the elucidation of the main differences in molecular structure of bacterial cells before and after NP treatment. Several studies address the issue of bacterial prototyping for subsequent database formation [36\u201341]. Some articles report the changes in FT-IR spectra and conclude that it is a promising method for the control and study of antibacterial agents. The main changes in bacterial cell structure lead to the variation of width, intensity and area of bands, corresponding to specific chemical compounds, with the Lorentzian fit of the peaks giving the necessary information. The overall disruption of the membrane leads to a change in the lipid bilayer\u2014the so-called increase of membrane fluidity [42]. The bands at 2854 cm\u22121 and 2924 cm\u22121 correspond to symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of CH2, respectively, and their broadening indicates the molecular disorder in the membrane, which may be caused by metal ion adhesion to bacterial cells [43,44]. Amide I and II bandwidths illustrate conformational freedom of proteins [43,44], and their\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3857 3 of 17\nnarrowing indicate an increase in protein binding, leading to the flexibility decrease caused by the proteins\u2019 binding to metal ions. TEM analysis is also a necessary tool for correct understanding of bacterial death mechanisms. It allows the detection of the penetration of NPs through the cell membrane and the subsequent damage [45]. In our work, we report the comparative analysis of Ag and Cu antibacterial effect in the form of NP colloidal solutions and ion-containing chemical compounds (AgNO3, CuCl) on S. aureus strain, supported with FT-IR spectroscopy data, TEM and SEM characterization along with EDS analysis and subsequent microbiological tests, confirming antibacterial effect."

            "text": "For the comparison of the antibacterial effect of Ag-/Cu NPs and Ag-/Cu ioncontaining salts we chose AgNO3 and CuCl2. Solutions with several concentrations were prepared for the subsequent bactericidal treatment: 10.8 mM, 7.2 mM and 3.6 mM AgNO3 solutions of metal-ion containing salts and Ag NPs colloid, fabricated in distilled water and then diluted resulting in 0.3 mg/mL, 0.18 mg/mL and 0.07 mg/mL concentration. For experiments with Cu, CuCl2 solutions were prepared with 51.6 mM, 12.4 mM and 6.2 mM concentrations, and Cu NPs colloids were diluted analogically to Ag NPs (0.3 mg/mL, 0.18 mg/mL and 0.07 mg/mL concentrations). Colloidal Ag and Cu NPs were obtained via nanosecond laser ablation (laser system HTF-Mark, Bulat, wavelength \u03bb = 1030 nm, pulsewidth \u03c4 = 120 ns) of 3 \u00d7 3 mm2 area on a bulk Ag (Sber, Moscow, Russia, 99.999% purity) or Cu target (P. N. Lebedev Physics Institute, Moscow, Russia, 99.999% purity) under the distilled water layer (thickness h \u2248 2 mm). Laser radiation was focused with an F-theta objective (focal length F = 160 mm) into a spot with 1/e diameter d \u2248 20 \u00b5m and raster-scanned across the area with the use of galvanometric scanning head (Ateko) with constant speed v = 60 mm/s, pulse repetition rate f = 20 kHz, average pulse energy E = 0.6 mJ, and for N = 40 times. As a result, the liquid above the target acquired either greyish-yellow color, which indicated the formation of Ag nanoparticles, or dark green in case of Cu NPs. Surface topography and chemical composition of the samples were characterized by scanning electron microscope (SEM) TESCAN Vega (Tescan JSCo, Brno, Czech Republic), equipped with an energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) module for the elemental composition analysis, by transmission electron microscope (TEM) Tecnai Osiris (FEI company, Hillsboro, OR) operating at 200 keV and equipped with Super-X SDD high-sensitivity EDS module. For SEM imaging a 5-\u00b5L drop of each sample was placed on a Si substrate and dried at room temperature. For TEM analysis the similar amount of liquid solution was placed on a carbon-coated golden grid. XRD spectra were obtained with DR-02 RADIAN diffractometer (JSC Expertcentr, Moscow, Russia), using Cu K\u03b1 X-rays with wavelength \u03bb = 0.154 nm. Data were recorded for the 2\u03b8 range of 10\u201360\u25e6 with a 0.05 step. For FT-IR spectral characterization, a drop of each sample (10 \u00b5L) was placed on a Si substrate and dried. Measurements were acquired in vacuum camera with the use of 2-mm diaphragm, in the range 800\u20133500 cm\u22121, using spectrometer V-70 (Bruker). Pure fluorite substrate and samples with deposited Ag and Cu oxide NPs were also measured for subsequent spectral normalization. After measurement of IR transmittance, all spectra were converted to optical density and normalized, after which their comparative analysis was implemented. UV-vis spectra of all solutions were measured with SF-2000 spectrometer (190\u20131100 nm measurement range, resolution 0.1 nm), and NP size distributions and z-potential were measured by Zeta Sizer spectrometer (Malvern Instruments, Inc., Malvern, UK), with each value being averaged from three parallel measurements. For biofilm preparation, substrates with areas 1 \u00d7 1 cm2 were cut from a large silicon (Si) plate (thickness 380 \u00b5M, purity 99.99%) for subsequent samples analysis. Bacterial\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3857 4 of 17\nisolates were provided by V. M. Gorbatov Federal Research Center for Food Systems of Russian Academy of Sciences. The over-night (18-h) culture was centrifuged with the subsequent removal of supernatant. The sedimented bacterial cells were intensively shaken with distilled water, after what the resulting suspension was then subjected to serial logarithmic dilutions up to 105 CFU/mL (colony-forming unit per milliliter). For bactericidal treatment, biofilms of S. aureus were grown for 24 h on Si substrates. Several samples were prepared: untreated S. aureus biofilm for control, and biofilms treated with AgNO3, Ag NPs, CuCl2 and Cu NPs solutions with different concentrations, three of each. Drops of each solution (10 \u00b5L) were put on grown biofilms and left for 20 min, during which the complete evaporation of liquid occurred. Each sample was also duplicated for parallel inoculation. One mL was taken from the biofilms in order to determine the number of CFU in the original sample (control). All samples were then titrated, plated on Petri dishes with solid nutrient medium and left for 24-h incubation, after which the number of CFU was determined."

Ag NPs have a round shape and a moderate polydispersity in size distribution (Figure 1d). Results of EDS, obtained at accelerating voltage of 10 keV, show the high content of oxygen in dried AgNO3 drop (1 to 5 ratio of silver to oxygen) (Figure 1e) and its significantly lower value for Ag NPs (Ag\u20140.7 at.%, O\u20140.9 at.%) (Figure 1f), which therefore prove the moderate oxidation of waterborne Ag NPs. Cu NPs in colloidal form have a weak absorption band at \u2248600 nm (Figure 2a), which corresponds to previously obtained data in the literature [49]. CuCl2 solutions have an absorption band at \u2248200\u2013250 nm (Figure 2b), which is in agreement with the literature [50] and disappears with a lowering of the solution concentration.\nNanomaterials\u00a02022,\u00a012,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 5\u00a0 of\u00a0 19\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure\u00a01.\u00a0UV\u2212vis\u00a0spectra\u00a0of\u00a0(a)\u00a0Ag\u00a0NP\u00a0colloids\u00a0and\u00a0(b)\u00a0AgNO3\u00a0solutions\u00a0with\u00a0different\u00a0concentra\u2010 tions;\u00a0SEM\u00a0and\u00a0EDS\u00a0characterization\u00a0of\u00a0AgNO3\u00a0solution\u00a0(c,e)\u00a0and\u00a0Ag\u00a0NP\u00a0colloid\u00a0(d,f),\u00a0dried\u00a0on\u00a0a\u00a0Si\u00a0 substrate.\u00a0Insets\u00a0on\u00a0(e,f):\u00a0tables\u00a0of\u00a0elements.\u00a0\nSEM\u00a0characterization\u00a0showed\u00a0 that\u00a0AgNO3\u00a0solution,\u00a0dried\u00a0at\u00a0 silicon\u00a0wafers,\u00a0 forms\u00a0 large\u00a0precipitates\u00a0(Figure\u00a01c).\u00a0Ag\u00a0NPs\u00a0have\u00a0a\u00a0round\u00a0shape\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a0m derate\u00a0polydispersity\u00a0 in\u00a0size\u00a0distribution\u00a0(Figure\u00a01d).\u00a0Results\u00a0of\u00a0EDS,\u00a0obtained\u00a0at\u00a0accelerating\u00a0voltage\u00a0of\u00a010\u00a0keV,\u00a0 show\u00a0the\u00a0high\u00a0content\u00a0of\u00a0oxygen\u00a0in\u00a0dried\u00a0AgNO3\u00a0drop\u00a0(1\u00a0to\u00a05\u00a0ratio\u00a0of\u00a0silver\u00a0to\u00a0oxygen)\u00a0 (Figure\u00a01e)\u00a0and\u00a0its\u00a0significantly\u00a0lower\u00a0value\u00a0for\u00a0Ag\u00a0NPs\u00a0(Ag\u20140.7\u00a0at.%,\u00a0O\u20140.9\u00a0at.%)\u00a0(Fig\u2010 ure\u00a01f),\u00a0which\u00a0therefore\u00a0prove\u00a0the\u00a0moderate\u00a0oxidation\u00a0of\u00a0waterborne\u00a0Ag\u00a0NPs.\u00a0 Cu\u00a0NPs\u00a0in\u00a0colloidal\u00a0form\u00a0have\u00a0a\u00a0weak\u00a0absorption\u00a0band\u00a0at\u00a0\u2248600\u00a0nm\u00a0(Figure\u00a02a),\u00a0which\u00a0 corresponds\u00a0 to\u00a0previously\u00a0obtained\u00a0data\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0 literature\u00a0 [49].\u00a0CuCl2\u00a0solutions\u00a0have\u00a0an\u00a0 absorption\u00a0band\u00a0at\u00a0\u2248200\u2013250\u00a0nm\u00a0(Figure\u00a02b),\u00a0which\u00a0is\u00a0in\u00a0agreement\u00a0with\u00a0the\u00a0literature\u00a0[50]\u00a0 and\u00a0disappears\u00a0with\u00a0a\u00a0lowering\u00a0of\u00a0the\u00a0solution\u00a0concentration.\u00a0\nFigure\u00a02.\u00a0UV\u2212vis\u00a0spectra\u00a0of\u00a0(a)\u00a0Cu\u00a0NP\u00a0colloid\u00a0and\u00a0(b)\u00a0CuCl2\u00a0solutions\u00a0with\u00a0different\u00a0concentrations.\u00a0\nSEM\u00a0and\u00a0EDS\u00a0characterization\u00a0of\u00a0CuCl2\u00a0solution\u00a0(c,e)\u00a0and\u00a0Cu\u00a0NP\u00a0colloid\u00a0(d,f)\u00a0dried\u00a0on\u00a0a\u00a0Si\u00a0substrate.\u00a0\nInsets\u00a0on\u00a0(e,f):\u00a0tables\u00a0of\u00a0elements.\u00a0\nSEM\u00a0characterization\u00a0showed\u00a0the\u00a0formation\u00a0of\u00a0precipitates\u00a0during\u00a0the\u00a0evaporation\u00a0 of\u00a0liquid\u00a0and\u00a0drying\u00a0of\u00a0CuCl2,\u00a0which\u00a0consist\u00a0of\u00a0Cu,\u00a0Cl\u00a0and\u00a0O\u00a0(Figure\u00a02c).\u00a0Both\u00a0these\u00a0pre\u2010 cipitates\u00a0and\u00a0waterborne\u00a0Cu\u00a0NPs\u00a0(Figure\u00a02d)\u00a0exhibit\u00a0strong\u00a0oxidation\u20140.1\u00a0at.%\u00a0(Cu)\u00a0to\u00a01\u00a0 at.%\u00a0(O)\u00a0for\u00a0CuCl2\u00a0(Figure\u00a02e),\u00a0and\u00a00.2\u00a0at.%\u00a0(Cu)\u00a0to\u00a02.4\u00a0at.%\u00a0(O)\u00a0for\u00a0Cu\u00a0NPs\u00a0(Figure\u00a02f).\u00a0 Ag\u00a0NPs,\u00a0fabricated\u00a0by\u00a0laser\u00a0ablation\u00a0of\u00a0bulk\u00a0target,\u00a0have\u00a0three\u00a0observable\u00a0fractions\u00a0 with\u00a0mean\u00a0sizes\u00a0of\u00a0\u224838,\u00a0100\u00a0and\u00a0590\u00a0nm\u00a0(Figure\u00a03a)\u00a0and\u00a0negative\u00a0z\u2010potential\u00a0\u221214.9\u00a0mV,\u00a0 whereas\u00a0Cu\u00a0NPs\u00a0have\u00a0main\u00a0peaks\u00a0at\u00a0\u224825,\u00a0117\u00a0nm\u00a0and\u00a0a\u00a0positive\u00a0z\u2010potential\u00a028.3\u00a0mV\u00a0(Fig\u2010 ure\u00a03a).\u00a0\nSEM characterization s t f r ti of precipitates during the vaporation of liquid and drying of CuCl2, which consist of Cu, Cl and O (Figure 2c).

For the spectra registration, NPs from the colloidal solution were dried on a cov r glass slide, therefor resulting in a broad fluorescence band from 2\u03b8 ~15 to 35\u25e6 (Figure 3b). The observed diffraction peaks at angle 2\u03b8\u223c 36.5\u25e6, 42\u25e6 and 50.6\u25e6 with (111), (002), and (200) planes correspond to face centered cubic structure (fcc) of Cu NPs [51]. Peaks at 2\u03b8\u223c 32.2\u25e6, 38\u25e6 and 44.2\u25e6 with (220), (111), and (200) planes correspond to hcp structured nanoparticles [52]. The presence of both fcc and hcp structures is attributed to the growth along different crystallographic planes during the formation of NPs [53]. Cu NPs are presented in form of Cu2O and Ag NPs\u2014AgO (Figure 3b). The crystallite size may be defined from the obtained spectra with the use of Scherer Formula (1):\nDh,k,l = 0.9 \u03bb/(\u03b2h,k,lcos\u03b8) (1)\nwhere \u03bb = 0.154 nm (Cu K\u03b1-line) is the X-ray wavelength, \u03b2 is the full linewidth at half maximum (FWHM), and \u03b8 is the diffraction angle at the corresponding planes. In order to get values of FWHM a Lorentz fit was implemented for each peak in Origin software, resulting in data (Figure 3c) that show the average size of Ag NP crystallites equals to \u2248 20 nm, and for Cu NP crystallites \u224811 nm, possibly illustrating the several-nm fraction in DLS size distributions (Figure 3a)."

Drops of each solution (10 \u00b5L) were put on grown biofilms and left for 20 min, during which the complete evaporation of liquid occurred. TEM images of S. aureus cells, treated with AgNO3 and Ag NPs (see Section 2 for details), along with a high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) image, are shown in Figures 4 and 5. According to EDS analysis, silver nitrate solution has precipitated in the form of nanoparticles on the cell surface, which may have ruptured the membrane and contributed to its bactericidal effect. The precipitate may have also penetrated the cell membrane, as the mean size of particles equals \u2248 8\u201310 nm (Figure 5). Despite its content in AgNO3 solution, N content was only observed in the volume of bacteria (Figures 4 and 5), presumably from the glycyl amide nitrogens in peptidoglycan and the esterified D-alanyl amine nitro ens in the wall teichoic acid [54].\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3857 7 of 17i ls\u00a0 022,\u00a012,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 7\u00a0 of\u00a0 19\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\nFigure\u00a04.\u00a0TEM\u00a0image\u00a0of\u00a0S.\u00a0aureus\u00a0cells\u00a0after\u00a0treatment\u00a0with\u00a0AgNO3\u00a010.8\u00a0mM\u2010solution,\u00a0distribution\u00a0\nof\u00a0elements\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0sample,\u00a0acquired\u00a0by\u00a0EDS\u00a0and\u00a0HAADF\u00a0image.\u00a0\n\u00a0 \u00a0\nFigure 4.

The marked yellow (1) and red (2) shapes of Ag NPs on TEM i age (Figure 6a) have the same contrast, which sug est the qual penetration depth of the electron beam, considering the exact same l mental composition of bacterial cell and\nPs. The corresponding EDS map of the same area (Figure 6b) shows that, while shape 2 (red) is detected, shape 1 (yellow) is not seen. This may be explained by the longer path of the electron beam not reaching NPs inside the cell and therefore blocking the emission of characteristic X-rays. It is known that SEM EDS analysis of bulk samples obtain data from a pear-shaped interaction volume [55,56], thus acquiring elemental composition at high values of accelerating voltage (about 20 keV) not only from the surface and subsurface layers, but also (mainly) from the bulk of the material. TEM EDS analysis, on the other hand, deals with samples with thicknesses\u2248 80 nm, where the interaction volume is limited by the aperture size of the electron beam [57]. The minimization of interaction volume provides better spatial resolution [58], therefore the observed differences in EDS maps for Ag NP-treated S. aureus cells cannot be attributed to artefacts.\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3857 8 of 17\nNanomaterials\u00a02022,\u00a012,\u00a0x\u00a0FOR\u00a0PEER\u00a0REVIEW\u00a0 9\u00a0 of\u00a0 19\u00a0 \u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0\n\u00a0 Figure\u00a06.\u00a0Enlarged\u00a0TEM\u00a0images\u00a0of\u00a0S.\u00a0aureus\u00a0cell\u00a0after\u00a0treatment\u00a0with\u00a0(a)\u00a0Ag\u00a0NPs\u00a0solution;\u00a0(c)\u00a0treated\u00a0 with\u00a0AgNO3and;\u00a0and\u00a0(b,d)\u00a0the\u00a0corresponding\u00a0EDS\u00a0map\u00a0of\u00a0Ag\u00a0content\u00a0in\u00a0(a,c).\u00a0Yellow\u00a0shapes\u00a0high\u2010 light\u00a0NPs,\u00a0visible\u00a0on\u00a0TEM\u00a0images\u00a0but\u00a0absent\u00a0in\u00a0EDS\u00a0maps.\u00a0Red\u00a0shapes\u00a0highlight\u00a0NPs\u00a0visible\u00a0both\u00a0in\u00a0 TEM\u00a0image\u00a0and\u00a0EDS\u00a0maps.\u00a0See\u00a0text\u00a0for\u00a0details.\u00a0\nLikewise,\u00a0Ag\u00a0precipitate\u00a0 in\u00a0area\u00a03\u00a0 (yellow)\u00a0 in\u00a0Figure\u00a06c,d\u00a0 is\u00a0not\u00a0seen\u00a0 in\u00a0 the\u00a0corre\u2010 sponding\u00a0EDS\u00a0map.\u00a0Areas\u00a04\u00a0(yellow)\u00a0and\u00a05\u00a0(red)\u00a0also\u00a0have\u00a0the\u00a0same\u00a0contrast,\u00a0although\u00a0 while\u00a0area\u00a05\u00a0is\u00a0clearly\u00a0seen\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0EDS\u00a0map,\u00a0area\u00a04\u00a0is\u00a0absent.\u00a0This\u00a0comparison\u00a0also\u00a0suggests\u00a0 the\u00a0penetration\u00a0of\u00a0precipitates\u00a0in\u00a0the\u00a0volume\u00a0of\u00a0bacterial\u00a0cell.\u00a0\n3.3.\u00a0FT\u2010IR\u00a0Spectral\u00a0Measurements\u00a0 For\u00a0bactericidal\u00a0treatment,\u00a0biofilms\u00a0of\u00a0S.\u00a0aureus\u00a0were\u00a0grown\u00a0for\u00a024\u00a0h\u00a0on\u00a0Si\u00a0substrates.\u00a0 Several\u00a0 samples\u00a0were\u00a0 prepared:\u00a0 untreated\u00a0 S.\u00a0 aureus\u00a0 biofilm\u00a0 for\u00a0 control,\u00a0 and\u00a0 biofilms\u00a0 treated\u00a0with\u00a0AgNO3,\u00a0Ag\u00a0NPs,\u00a0CuCl2\u00a0and\u00a0Cu\u00a0NPs\u00a0solutions\u00a0with\u00a0different\u00a0concentrations,\u00a0 three\u00a0of\u00a0each.\u00a0Drops\u00a0of\u00a0each\u00a0solution\u00a0(10\u00a0\u03bcl)\u00a0were\u00a0put\u00a0on\u00a0grown\u00a0biofilms\u00a0and\u00a0left\u00a0for\u00a020\u00a0 min,\u00a0during\u00a0which\u00a0the\u00a0complete\u00a0evaporation\u00a0of\u00a0liquid\u00a0occurred.\u00a0FT\u2010IR\u00a0spectra\u00a0of\u00a0all\u00a0pre\u2010 pared\u00a0samples\u00a0are\u00a0presented\u00a0in\u00a0Figure\u00a07\u00a0(see\u00a0Section\u00a02\u00a0for\u00a0detailed\u00a0description\u00a0of\u00a0FT\u2010IR\u00a0 measurements).\u00a0Optical\u00a0density\u00a0values\u00a0were\u00a0calculated\u00a0from\u00a0the\u00a0initial\u00a0data\u00a0by\u00a0formula\u00a0 OD\u00a0=\u00a0lg(Tsubstrate/T).\u00a0\ni re 6.

Under normal growth conditions of bacterial cells, the maximum of the amide I band (1650\u20131660 cm\u22121) illustrates the predominance of \u03b1-helices among the secondary structure components of bacterial ellular proteins. Bands at 2854 cm\u22121 and 2924 cm\u22121 correspond to sym etrical and asymmetrical stretching vibrations of CH2 in lipids. Total band area corresponds to the concentration of the functional group, and its bandwidth reflects the conformational freedom and flexibility, and Lorentz fitting of the bands provided the necessary parameters (Tables 2 and 3).\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3857 10 of 17\nBandwidths of amide I and II bands provide information about conformational freedom of proteins [61,62]. An increase in protein binding leads to the decrease of flexibility and the narrowing of the bandwidth, and in our work the amide II bandwidth narrows only in case of treatment of bacteria with CuCl2, which may indicate the binding of the proteins to Cu ions. The considerable broadening of amide bands in all other cases (up to \u224826%) may be caused by the rupture of the membrane. The areas of bands illustrate changes in the concentrations of molecules, to vibrations of which they correspond. Amide I and II bands area increased significantly in all cases except CuCl2 treatment (Table 3), which may indicate the increase of protein and polysaccharides concentrations [68]. Membrane lipids are represented in FT-IR spectra as bands at 2854 cm\u22121 and 2924 cm\u22121, which correspond to the symmetric and asymmetric CH2 stretching modes [69] and may indicate the disorder of the acyl chains of lipids and the interactions between lipids and membrane proteins. This frequency decrease by 2 cm\u22121 in AgNO3 indicates the transition of the membrane lipids from an ordered to a disordered state [70\u201372] and no shift in all other cases. Bands narrow after treatment with CuCl2 and Ag NPs (Table 2). Its broadening in all other cases may indicate a higher level of membrane fluidity [72]\u2014the extent of molecular disorder and molecular motion within a lipid bilayer [69]. CH2 symmetric and asymmetric stretching bands\u2019 areas decrease after treatment with almost all NPs and metal ion-containing solutions (Table 3), except some samples that were treated with CuCl2. This may indicate a lower concentration of saturated lipids [73] and an increase of membrane fluidity.

The band at 966 cm\u22121 is related to RNA and DNA backbone C\u2013C stretching of nucleic acids, and its presence in all spectra without frequency shifts indicates that DNA is in the \u03b2-helix form [67] but perhaps with reduced flexibility due to interaction with metal ions. The band at 996 cm\u22121 corresponds to ribose\u2013phosphate main chain vibrations of the ribose skeleton [73] and is present in all spectra, both control and treated.

            "text": "Culture of bacteria was implemented as follows: after treatment with NPs and metalcontaining solutions, all substrates, including control, were moved to individual sterile testing tubes with saline solution and shaken intensively for 30 min. The resulting suspension was added to the nutrient medium and placed in a thermostat for 24 h at 37 \u25e6C. After that, the number of colony forming units (CFUs) was determined and compared with the control samples (Table 4, Figure A1).\nResults of S. aureus treatment with Ag and Cu NPs, AgNO3 and CuCl2 solutions with different concentration (Table 4) demonstrate strong antibacterial effect. In all cases, metal NPs and ion-containing solutions have shown 100% efficiency against S. aureus. The increase of the membrane fluidity, shown in FT-IR spectra, and its subsequent rupture because of Ag and Cu NPs may be related to lipid peroxidation by ROS such as superoxide (O2) and hydroxyl radicals (\u2022OH) [74]. Direct contact between NPs and the bacterial membrane is necessary [75\u201377], and while bacteria are known to have a negative charge, it is believed that the positive z-potential of NPs ensure the contact due to electrostatic attraction (Cu NPs in our experiments, Figure 5). Vice versa, electrostatic repulsion between bacterial cell and NPs with negative z-potential is assumed, although in our case negatively charged Ag NPs (Figure 5) still have a strong antibacterial effect. The detected increase of the membrane fluidity and the transition of the membrane lipids from an ordered to a disordered state, as well as NPs precipitation on the cell membranes (Figures 7 and 8), confirms this implication. It is believed that NPs toxicity on bacterial cells can be explained by NPs penetration in the cell. The largest pores in the bacterial membrane have a mean size of several nm [78,79], and NPs produced by laser ablation have a correspondingly small fraction (Figure 3a). According to TEM data, penetration of NPs and precipitates is observed (Figures 7 and 8). Cellular uptake of metallic ions leads to the subsequent disruption of DNA functionality and cell death [80\u201382]. It has also been suggested that Cu ions cause damage to phosphorus and sulfur-containing biomolecules, which leads to disruption of intracellular biochemical processes [13,14], which can explain the toxicity of metal salts on bacteria.\nNanomaterials 2022, 12, 3857 13 of 17\nSummarizing all of the above, we can propose several individual mechanisms of S. aureus death due to Ag NPs, Cu NPs, AgNO3 and CuCl2.\n(1) Ag NPs release ions and ROS, which, due to the close contact of NPs and bacteria in a concentrated (0.3 mg/mL) colloidal solution, and despite negative z-potential, result in lipid peroxidation and cell destruction; (2) Cu NPs with high positive z-potential are adjacent to bacterial cells via electrostatic attraction and also cause ROS-related lipid peroxidation; (3) Ag NO3 solution forms precipitates on the bacterial cell surface, which lead to the mechanical rupture of the membrane and subsequent penetration of the precipitates in the emerged damaged spots, and to the complete destruction of the membrane and bacterial death; (4) Cu ions from the CuCl2 solution cause damage to phosphorus and sulfur-containing biomolecules, which leads to disruption of intracellular biochemical processes."

            "text": "In this work, we studied the bactericidal effect of Ag and Cu NPs in colloidal form and AgNO3 and CuCl2 solutions with different concentrations on S. aureus strain. All samples were characterized by UV-vis spectroscopy, SEM, TEM and EDS. Bacterial inoculation showed considerable antibacterial activity of metal ions-containing salts regardless of their concentration. FT-IR spectroscopy analysis showed the broadening of the amide I and II bands, as well as CH2-related peak and its frequency decrease, which indicates the increase of membrane fluidity, leading to bacterial death. TEM analysis confirmed the penetration of Ag NPs and precipitates from AgNO3 solution. The main mechanisms of the antibacterial effect were proposed: Ag and Cu NPs release ions and ROS, which result in lipid peroxidation and cell destruction; AgNO3 solution forms precipitates on the bacterial cell surface, which lead to the mechanical rupture of the membrane and subsequent possible penetration of the precipitates in the emerged damaged spots, and to complete destruction of the membrane and bacterial death; Cu ions from the CuCl2 solution cause damage to phosphorus and sulfur-containing biomolecules, which leads to disruption of intracellular biochemical processes.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, S.K.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, I.S.
