Development and Testing of Novel Hsp90 Inhibitors: Given the promising role of Hsp90 inhibitors in both GBM and neurodegeneration, future research could focus on the development and testing of novel Hsp90 inhibitors. This could include the synthesis of new molecules with improved brain barrier penetration, lower toxicity, and enhanced specificity for Hsp90 in the brain tumor environment. Additionally, exploring the combination of these inhibitors with current GBM treatments (like TMZ and radiotherapy) could offer synergistic effects, potentially improving patient outcomes.

Investigation of Natural Hsp90 Inhibitors in GBM and Neurodegeneration: The paper highlights the dual protection offered by natural Hsp90 inhibitors against GBM and neurodegenerative diseases. Future research could expand on this by conducting comprehensive screening and characterization of natural compounds with Hsp90 inhibitory activity. This could include detailed mechanistic studies to understand their mode of action, optimization for increased potency, and evaluation of their therapeutic effects in animal models of GBM and neurodegenerative diseases.

Elucidating the Role of Hsp90 in GBM Tumor Microenvironment and Neurodegeneration: While the paper discusses the involvement of Hsp90 in GBM progression and neurodegeneration, detailed studies are needed to elucidate its role in the tumor microenvironment and neurodegenerative processes. Research could focus on understanding how Hsp90 interacts with its client proteins in these contexts, its contribution to tumor resistance, and its impact on neuronal cell death and synaptic dysfunction. This could lead to the identification of new therapeutic targets within the Hsp90 chaperone network.

Enhancing the Delivery of Hsp90 Inhibitors to the Brain: One of the challenges with treating brain tumors and neurodegenerative diseases is the effective delivery of drugs across the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Future research could explore innovative drug delivery systems (e.g., nanoparticles, liposomes, or BBB-penetrating peptides) to enhance the delivery of Hsp90 inhibitors to the brain. This could improve the efficacy of these compounds in treating GBM and neurodegenerative diseases.

Clinical Trials of Hsp90 Inhibitors in GBM and Neurodegenerative Diseases: Despite the promising preclinical evidence, there is a lack of clinical trials evaluating Hsp90 inhibitors in GBM and neurodegenerative diseases. Future research could involve the design and execution of clinical trials to assess the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of Hsp90 inhibitors in patients with GBM or neurodegenerative diseases. This could also include trials exploring the combination of Hsp90 inhibitors with standard therapies to evaluate potential synergistic effects and improved patient outcomes.
