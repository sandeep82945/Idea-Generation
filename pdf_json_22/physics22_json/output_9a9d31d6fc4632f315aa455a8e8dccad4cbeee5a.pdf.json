    "abstractText": "According to the Borde-Guth-Vilenkin (BGV) theorem an expanding region of spacetime cannot be extended to the past beyond some boundary B. Therefore, the inflationary universe must have had some kind of beginning. However, the BGW theorem says nothing about the boundary conditions on B, or even about its location. Here we present a single-scalar field model of the Two-Measure Theory, where the non-Riemannian volume element \u03a5d4x is present in the action. As a result of the model dynamics, an upper bound \u03c60 of admissible values of the scalar field \u03c6 appears, which sets the position of B in the form of a spacelike hypersurface \u03a5(x) = 0 with a boundary condition: \u03a5\u2192 0+ as \u03c6\u2192 \u03c6 \u2212 0 . A detailed study has established that if the initial kinetic energy density \u03c1 kin prevails over initial gradient energy density \u03c1 grad then there is an interval of initial values \u03c6 (min) in \u2264 \u03c6in < \u03c60, where \u03c1 (in) kin and \u03c1 (in) grad cannot exceed the potential energy density and hence the initial conditions necessary for the onset of inflation are satisfied. It is shown that under almost all possible left-handed boundary conditions on B, that is where \u03a5 \u2192 0\u2212, the metric tensor in the Einstein frame has a jump discontinuity on B, so the Christoffel connection coefficients are not defined on the spacelike hypersurface \u03a5 = 0. Thus, if \u03c6 in \u2264 \u03c6in < \u03c60 and \u03c1 (in) kin > \u03c1 (in) grad, then there was an inflationary stage in the history of our Universe and the congruence of timelike geodesics cannot be extended to the past beyond the hypersurface \u03a5 = 0. ar X iv :2 20 9. 00 37 8v 5 [ he pth ] 2 M ay 2 02 3",

            "text": "The purpose of this paper is to present a simple model in which, over a wide range of parameters, there is a close relationship between two fundamental problems of inflationary cosmology. One of them is the problem of the initial conditions necessary for the onset of inflation [1]. The second problem is related to the Borde-Guth-Vilenkin (BGV) theorem [2], which states that inflationary models cannot be extended to the past beyond some boundary B. As will be shown, this relationship allows us to get answers to the questions that are the main content of these two problems.\n\u2022 The problem of initial conditions for inflation.\nConditions that the initial kinetic and gradient energy densities of the canonically normalised scalar field should not exceed the potential energy density\n\u03c1 (in) kin =\n1 2 \u03d5\u03072in . V (\u03d5in) and \u03c1 (in) grad = 1 2 |(\u2202k\u03d5)in(\u2202k\u03d5)in| . V (\u03d5in) (1.1)\nare well known as the constraints neeeded for the onset of inflation. According to the understanding developed in the first models of chaotic inflation [3], [4], when the classical space-time domain first appears after the Planck quantum era, the total energy density is of the order of M4P , and inflation begins with V (\u03d5in) \u223c M4P . Then all admissible values \u03d5in, \u03d5\u0307in, (\u2202k\u03d5)in of the classical scalar field \u03d5 satisfying (1.1) can serve as initial values for inflation. At first glance, such an idea of the beginning of inflation cannot contradict the constraint V (\u03d5) \u223c 10\u221210M4P in the last stages of inflation. However, the situation has changed dramatically over the past few years.\nData of recent cosmological observations [5]-[8] favor inflationary models with plateau potentials, and with the height of the plateau Vpl \u223c 10\u221210M4P . There exist a number of field theory models in which the plateau-like potentials arise due to the implementation of various original ideas, and these potentials satisfy the CMB constraints. These include the Starobinsky model [9], the Goncharov-Linde model [10], the Higgs inflation models [11]-[21]. Of particular interest are \u03b1-attractor models, which were initiated by the pioneering work [22] and which have been intensively studied in recent years. To date, there is the broad class of the cosmological attractor models [23]-[31], which generalize most of the previously proposed models with plateau potentials.\nDespite such an impressive success of plateau-like models compared to all other models, a lively discussion ensued, during which even the very idea of inflation has been called into question [32]-[35]. An obvious disadvantage of the models with plateau potentials mentioned above is the infinite length of the potential energy density plateau. In such a theory, all initial values of the homogeneous component of the scalar field \u03d5 are equally probable. Therefore, an excessively long duration of inflation is possible. The main problem formulated in paper[32] is also related to the infinite length of the potential energy density plateau. If the height of the plateau is Vpl \u223c 10\u221210M4P , then there\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nis a huge range of possible values of the initial kinetic and gradient energy densities greater than Vpl, up to the Planck density. Therefore, in contrast to the understanding developed in first models of chaotic inflation [3], [4] of how initial conditions for inflation arise, there is no reason to believe that conditions (1.1) necessary for the onset of inflation are satisfied. A possible response to this challenge may be to modify the model in such a way that the potential has a plateau of finite length, after which, at very large \u03d5, the potential rapidly increases. An example of this type of model is the \"singular \u03b1-attractor\" model proposed by Linde in [1], in which the simplest \u03b1-attractor potential takes an exponentially steep form for very large \u03d5. This makes it possible to provide conditions for power-law inflation, which starts at the Planck density, and thus makes it possible to solve the problem of initial conditions in the spirit of [4].\n\u2022 The problem of initial cosmological singularity in inflationary cosmology\nAccording to the BGV theorem[2] which strengthens earlier proofs of singularity theorems [36], [37], in inflationary cosmology almost all past-directed timelike and null geodesics cannot be extended to the past beyond some boundary B. The statement of the BGW theorem is quite general because it is based on a kinematic argument. The main problem that inevitably follows from the statement of the BGV theorem is that the inflationary universe must have had some kind of beginning, and, therefore, some new physics is necessary in order to determine the correct conditions at the boundary B. However, the BGW theorem says nothing about the boundary conditions on B, or even about its location.\nIt seems that the most attractive proposals for overcoming this problem are based on the idea of the possible existence of inflationary spacetime regions with opposite directions of the thermodynamic arrow of time [38]-[41]. Taking this idea as a hint and combining it with the existence of a spacelike boundary surface B predicted by the BGV theorem, in this paper we will try to build a model from the dynamics of which the following geometric approach to solving the problem will follow.\n\u2022 Suppose that the boundary B is a spacelike hypersurface in the space-time manifold M4 that separates submanifolds M (+) 4 and M (\u2212) 4 of M4 with opposite arrows of time,\nbut with the same space-orientation. As a result, the space-time orientations of the submanifolds M (+)4 and M (\u2212) 4 are opposite. Consequently, the space-time manifold M4 = M (+) 4 \u222aM (\u2212) 4 turns out to be non-orientable. These conclusions are based on the definition, where the orientation is determined by the coordinate atlas (collection of maps). But n-dimensional differentiable manifolds (with or without boundary) allow one to define an orientation in an equivalent way using the n-form. Therefore, the orientations of the submanifolds M (+)4 and M (\u2212) 4 can be equivalently defined by either oriented atlases or oriented 4-forms. 1\nIn the model studied in this paper, it is assumed that the space-time manifold M4 is initially orientable. It will be shown that the geometric pattern described above is generated by the dynamics of the model, i.e., is the result of spontaneous violation of the orientability of M4. It turns out that this effect arises quite naturally in the Two-Measure Theory (TMT), where in the integral of the primordial action, along with terms with the standard volume\n1More mathematical details will be presented in Sec.4.2.\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nmeasure dVg = \u221a \u2212gd4x, there are terms with an alternative, metric independent volume measure dV\u03a5 constructed as the following 4-form, globally defined on the orientable spacetime manifold M4 using 4 scalar functions \u03d5a (a = 1, .., 4)\ndV\u03a5 = \u03a5d 4x \u2261 \u03b5\u00b5\u03bd\u03b3\u03b2\u03b5abcd\u2202\u00b5\u03d5a\u2202\u03bd\u03d5b\u2202\u03b3\u03d5c\u2202\u03b2\u03d5dd4x\n= 4!d\u03d51 \u2227 d\u03d52 \u2227 d\u03d53 \u2227 d\u03d54. (1.2)\nHere \u03a5 is a scalar density, that is under general coordinate transformations with positive Jacobian it has the same transformation law as \u221a \u2212g. In contrast to the density \u221a \u2212g of the standard volume measure dVg, the density \u03a5 of the 4-form dV\u03a5 is sign-indefinite and, due to its continuity, can also take zero values in the general case. We will show that in the inflationary model studied in this paper, \u03a5 can indeed take on a zero value as a result of the dynamics and, thus, the boundary B naturally arises in the form of a spacelike hypersurface \u03a5(x) = 0.. At the end of this introductory part, it is necessary to briefly formulate the basics and main results of the TMTmodel under study, which demonstrate the close relationship between the problem of the initial cosmological singularity and the problem of initial conditions for inflation. a) The primordial action2 of the TMT cosmological model is formulated in the Palatini formalism3 on the differentiable (and orientable) space-time manifold M4 where the following smooth variables are globally defined: four scalar functions \u03d5a (a = 1, .., 4), affine connection \u0393\u03bb\u00b5\u03bd , primordial (original) metric tensor g\u00b5\u03bd , and the scalar field \u03c6 non-minimally coupled to gravity. The potential of the scalar field \u03c6 entering the primordial action has \"the maximally possible standard form\"\nV (\u03c6) = 1\n2 m2\u03c62 +\n\u03bb 4 \u03c64 with m2 > 0. (1.3)\nThe TMT effective potential of the canonically normalized scalar field \u03d5 turns out to be of the shape which is a modification of the T -model type potential. b) In a wide range of model parameters, a hypersurface \u03a5(x) = 0 arises that splits the manifoldM4 into two submanifoldsM (+) 4 andM (\u2212) 4 with opposite signs of \u03a5 corresponding to the opposite space-time orientations. This effect is an inevitable consequence of the dynamics of the model precisely due to the fact that, along with other variables, the action varies with respect to the functions \u03d5a from which the 4-form dV\u03a5 = \u03a5d4x is built. c) With an appropriate choice of an arbitrary integration constant, the universe, which has properties corresponding to ours, turns out to be in the submanifold M (+)4 , where \u03a5 > 0. In our Universe, for admissible values of the canonically normalized scalar field \u03d5, there is a limiting upper bound \u03d50, which arises from the fact that \u03a5 \u2192 0+ as \u03d5(x) \u2192 \u03d5 \u22120 . It follows from this that in a homogeneous and isotropic universe the inflationary solution for the classical scalar field \u03d5(t) cannot be continued into the infinite past. The boundary B appearing\n2In \"conventional\" alternative theories of gravity, the original action differs from the Einstein-Hilbert action only in the form of the Lagrangian. In TMT, the main difference lies in the volume measure, although a modification of the Lagrangian is also possible. Therefore, the original action of TMT differs from the Einstein-Hilbert action in the form of the Lagrangian density. From this it follows that it would not be quite correct to use the term Jordan frame for variables used in the original action of TMT. In order to emphasize this difference we will use the terms \"primordial variables\" and \"primordial action\" instead of \"variables in the original frame\" and \"original action\".\n3Ref. [42] is an example for studying inflation with non-minimal coupling in the Palatini formulation.\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nin the BGV theorem arises as a hypersurface \u03a5(x) = 0 whose position is determined by the maximum allowable value \u03d50 of the classical scalar field \u03d5. Note that the model equations are not applicable at the boundary B itself, but the Hubble parameter remains finite at any proximity to the boundary B. d) If in our Universe the initial kinetic energy density \u03c1(in)kin prevails over initial gradient energy density \u03c1(in)grad then there is an interval of initial values \u03d5 (min) in \u2264 \u03d5in < \u03d50, where \u03c1 (in) kin and \u03c1 (in) grad cannot exceed the potential energy density and hence the initial conditions necessary for the beginning of inflation are satisfied. e) Behind the boundary B, that is in M (\u2212)4 , where \u03a5 < 0, a variety of different universes with different vacuum states of the classical scalar field \u03d5 can be realized by an appropriate choice of the integration constant M and the value of \u03d5\u030c0 such that \u03a5 \u2192 0\u2212 when \u03d5 \u2192 \u03d5\u030c0. As a result, under almost all possible left-handed boundary conditions on B the metric tensor in the Einstein frame has a jump discontinuity on B, so the Christoffel connection coefficients are not defined on the spacelike hypersurface \u03a5 = 0. Therefore, if \u03d5(min)in \u2264 \u03d5in < \u03d50 and \u03c1\n(in) kin > \u03c1 (in) grad , then there was an inflationary stage in the history of our Universe and the timelike geodesics cannot be extended to the past beyond the hypersurface \u03a5 = 0. f) The meaning of the title of the paper is precisely that the maximum allowable value \u03d50 determines the position of the boundary B and is the exact upper limit of the interval of \u03d5 in which the beginning of inflation is guaranteed. The organization of paper is as follows. In Sec.2, the simplest TMT model of the scalar field \u03c6 with potential (1.3) non-minimally coupled to gravity is formulated and studied. The use of the volume measure \u03a5d4x in the primordial action naturally leads to the need, along with the usual vacuum-like term, to include in the primordial action a new kind of vacuumlike term with the corresponding model parameter V2 of dimensionality (mass)4. It is shown that in the case of a zero effective cosmological constant, the TMT effective potential of the canonically normalized scalar field \u03d5 has a form similar to the potential of the T -model [22], but with a plateau of finite length: for \u03d5 greater than some value \u03d5\u2217, the potential becomes exponentially steep. The length of the plateau, and hence the duration of the quasi-de Sitter inflation, is controlled by the parameter V2. To avoid a misconception about the requirement that \u03a5 be sign-definite, it is necessary to clearly and unambiguously formulate the following result of the model: the system of equations of motion obtained from the principle of least action has nontrivial solutions only if the sign of \u03a5 does not change during the entire evolution of the Universe. We show in Sec.2 that due to the sign-definiteness of \u03a5 in our Universe, only the values \u03d5 < \u03d5\u2217 are possible and limit \u03d5 \u2192 \u03d5\u2217 corresponds to the process of approaching the boundary B whose equation is\n\u03a5(x) = 0. (1.4)\nIn Sec.3, we study a more general model that takes into account the arbitrariness in the choice of coefficients in a linear combination of volume elements dVg = \u221a \u2212gd4x and dV\u03a5 = \u03a5d4x. It turns out that in such a model, the TMT effective potential has two plateaus. With an appropriate choice of parameters, for \u03d5 < \u03d50 (\u03d50 is close to \u03d5\u2217), the shape of the potential is almost the same as in the model of Sec.2, but for \u03d5 > \u03d50, instead of an almost exponential growth, the potential has a second, higher plateau of infinite length. In addition, in this model, when studying the possible initial conditions for inflation, it is found that the above requirement that \u03a5 be sign-definite imposes restrictions on the admissible values of the kinetic and gradient energy densities. A detailed analysis given in Appendix\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nB shows that there is an interval of initial values \u03d5in, bounded from above by \u03d50, in which the initial conditions necessary for inflation are guaranteed to be satisfied; this requires the only additional condition, which is that the initial kinetic energy density is greater than the initial gradient energy density. In Sec.4 we show that the boundary hypersurface \u03a5(x) = 0 is spacelike. Analysing the one-sided boundary conditions on \u03a5(x) = 0 we find that the metric tensor in the Einstein frame has discontinuety on \u03a5(x) = 0, from which it follows that past directed geodesics cannot be continued beyond the boundary B. After this we shortly review some mathematical aspects concerning orientability that allows us to interpret the obtained effect as a spontaneous violation of the orientability of the spacetime manifold M4. Sec.5 is devoted to a discussion of the radical changes introduced by TMT into field theory, due to which the results of this work were achieved. To facilitate understanding of the paper for the reader not familiar with TMT, in Appendix A we give a very brief introduction to the basics of TMT and describe the procedure of TMT, the implementation of which allows one to obtain the equations, the potential of the scalar field and the action in the Einstein frame, which are further called TMT effective equations, the TMT effective potential and the TMT effective action, respectively. Appendix C outlines the algorithm that can be used to calculate quantum corrections to the model studied in this paper."

In this section, the primordial action is chosen as follows\nS = \u222b d4x( \u221a \u2212g + \u03a5) [Lgr + L\u03c6 + Lnonmin] + Svac, (2.1)\nwhere\nLgr = \u2212 M2P\n2 R(\u0393, g); L\u03c6 =\n1 2 g\u03b1\u03b2\u03c6,\u03b1\u03c6,\u03b2 \u2212 V (\u03c6); Lnonmin = \u2212 1 2 \u03beR(\u0393, g)\u03c62 (2.2)\nHere MP is the reduced Planck mass; \u0393 stands for affine connection; R(\u0393, g) = g\u00b5\u03bdR\u00b5\u03bd(\u0393), R\u00b5\u03bd(\u0393) = R \u03bb \u00b5\u03bd\u03bb(\u0393) and R \u03bb \u00b5\u03bd\u03c3(\u0393) \u2261 \u0393\u03bb\u00b5\u03bd,\u03c3 + \u0393\u03bb\u03b3\u03c3\u0393 \u03b3 \u00b5\u03bd \u2212 (\u03bd \u2194 \u03c3). In our notations the parameter \u03be of non-minimal coupling of a massless scalar field in the case of a conformal coupling in a theory with only the volume element \u221a \u2212gd4x would be equal to \u03be = \u221216 .\nContribution of the vacuum-like terms to the primordial action is defined by\nSvac =\n\u222b d4x ( \u2212 \u221a \u2212gV1 \u2212\n\u03a52\u221a \u2212g V2\n) . (2.3)\nIf the first term in Eq.(2.3) was present in Einstein\u2019s GR, V1 would be a cosmological constant. The term with V2 was first introduced in Ref. [43]. The first reason for adding the term with V2 is that the term \u221d \u03a5 = \u03b6(x) \u221a \u2212g, which can be expected as the contribution of quantum-gravitational effects to a vacuum-like action, does not contribute to the equations of motion. Therefore, the next in powers of \u03b6 vacuum-like term can be of the form \u221d \u03b62 \u221a \u2212g = \u03a52/ \u221a \u2212g. There are also more pragmatic reasons. It turns out that thanks to this term, the corresponding TMT effective potential and the TMT effective action acquire fundamentally new important properties without which the goals of this paper could not be achieved.\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nIn general, there is no reason why the coefficients in linear combinations of \u03a5 and \u221a \u2212g\nin volume elements of different terms in the action should be the same. In the gravitational term with Lgr, the common factor of the linear combination can be absorbed by redefining Newton\u2019s constant. After that, by rescaling the fields \u03d5a in Eq.(1.2), the volume element in the gravitational term with Lgr becomes as in Eq.(2.1). Then in all other contributions to the primordial action there is only the freedom to absorb the common factor by rescaling \u03c6, the parameters in the primordial potential V (\u03c6) and \u03be. As a result, the corresponding volume elements can have the form (bi \u221a \u2212g + s\u03a5) d4x, where bi and s = \u00b11 are arbitrary model parameters. The appearance of the parameter s is due to the fact that in the primordial action \u03a5 can equally be both positive and negative. Therefore, in general, \u03a5 can enter the primordial action with different signs. In this paper, we will restrict ourselves to the case s = 1. The choice of the same volume element ( \u221a \u2212g + \u03a5)d4x for all terms in Eq.(2.1) made in this section means that we are dealing with the simplest version of the model. For the primordial inflaton potential V (\u03c6) we choose a simple model of massive scalar field with quartic selfinteraction, Eq.(1.3). Now, following the prescription of the TMT procedure described in Appendix A, we consider the equations of motion following from the primordial action (2.1). Varying the action with respect to scalar functions \u03d5a of which \u03a5 is built we get\nB\u00b5a\u2202\u00b5 [Lgr + L\u03c6 + Lnonmin \u2212 2\u03b6V2] = 0 where B\u00b5a = \u03b5\u00b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\u03b5abcd\u2202\u03bd\u03d5b\u2202\u03b1\u03d5c\u2202\u03b2\u03d5d, (2.4)\nand where the following scalar \u03b6(x) appears:\n\u03b6(x) def = dV\u03a5 dVg \u2261 \u03a5\u221a \u2212g\n(2.5)\nSince Det(B\u00b5a ) = 4 \u22124\n4! \u03a5 3 it follows that if\neverywhere \u03a5(x) 6= 0, (2.6)\nthe equality\n\u2212 M2P\n2\n( 1 + \u03be \u03c62\nM2P\n) R(\u0393, g) + 1\n2 g\u03b1\u03b2\u03c6,\u03b1\u03c6,\u03b2 \u2212 V (\u03c6)\u2212 2\u03b6V2 =M (2.7)\nmust be satisfied, whereM is a constant of integration with the dimension of (mass)4. Variation with respect to g\u00b5\u03bd yields the equation\n(1 + \u03b6) [ \u2212 M2P\n2\n( 1 + \u03be \u03c62\nM2P\n) R\u00b5\u03bd(\u0393) + 1\n2 \u03c6,\u00b5\u03c6,\u03bd ] \u2212 1\n2 g\u00b5\u03bd\n[ \u2212 M2P\n2\n( 1 + \u03be \u03c62\nM2P\n) R(\u0393, g) + 1\n2 g\u03b1\u03b2\u03c6,\u03b1\u03c6,\u03b2 \u2212 V (\u03c6)\u2212 V1 + \u03b62V2\n] = 0. (2.8)\nThe trace of Eq.(2.8) is the following (\u03b6 \u2212 1) [ \u2212 M2P\n2\n( 1 + \u03be \u03c62\nM2P\n) R(\u0393, g) + 1\n2 g\u03b1\u03b2\u03c6,\u03b1\u03c6,\u03b2\n] + 2V (\u03c6) + 2V1 \u2212 2\u03b62V2 = 0. (2.9)\nEliminating the expression \u221212M 2 P\n( 1 + \u03be \u03c6 2\nM2P\n) R(\u0393, g) from Eqs.(2.7) and (2.9) one can see\nthat the term 2\u03b62V2 is canceled, and the consistency of these equations requires that the\n\u2013 6 \u2013\nscalar function \u03b6(x) satisfies the following relation\n\u03b6 = \u03b6(\u03c6(x)) = M\u2212 2V1 \u2212 V (\u03c6) M\u2212 2V2 + V (\u03c6)\n(2.10)\ndescribing \u03b6(x) as the local function of the inflaton \u03c6(x) 4. Following the terminology of earlier works [43]-[51], we will call this a constraint. It should be noted that in the Palatini formulation \u03b6(x) is not a physical degree of freedom. Therefore, when we call Eq.(2.10) a constraint, we must keep in mind that it is different in meaning from the usual constraint in the field theory models, where it describes the relationship between dynamical degrees of freedom.\nThe inflaton equation reads\n1\u221a \u2212g\n\u2202\u00b5 [ (1 + \u03b6) \u221a \u2212gg\u00b5\u03bd\u2202\u03bd\u03c6 ] + (1 + \u03b6) [ V \u2032(\u03c6) + \u03beR(\u0393, g)\u03c6 ] = 0. (2.11)\nVariation of the affine connection yields the equation that has been solved in Ref. [43] for the simpler case. For the case of the action (2.1) containing a non-minimal coupling the result is\n\u0393\u03bb\u00b5\u03bd = {\u03bb\u00b5\u03bd}+ (\u03b4\u03bb\u00b5\u03c3,\u03bd +\u03b4\u03bb\u03bd\u03c3,\u00b5\u2212\u03c3,\u03b2 g\u00b5\u03bdg\u03bb\u03b2), (2.12)\nwhere {\u03bb\u00b5\u03bd} are the Christoffel\u2019s connection coefficients of the metric g\u00b5\u03bd and\n\u03c3(x) = 1\n2 ln\n[( 1 + \u03b6(\u03c6(x)) )( 1 + \u03be \u03c62(x)\nM2P\n)] . (2.13)\nIf \u03c3(x) 6= const. the metricity condition does not hold and consequently geometry of the space-time with the metric g\u00b5\u03bd is generically non-Riemannian. In this paper, we will totally ignore a possibility to incorporate the torsion tensor, which could be an additional source for the space-time to be different from Riemannian.\nIt is easy to see that the transformation of the metric\ng\u0303\u00b5\u03bd = (1 + \u03b6(\u03c6))\n( 1 + \u03be \u03c62(x)\nM2P\n) g\u00b5\u03bd (2.14)\nturns the connection \u0393\u03bb\u00b5\u03bd into the Christoffel connection coefficients of the metric g\u0303\u00b5\u03bd and the space-time turns into (pseudo) Riemannian. Gravitational equations (2.8) expressed in terms of the metric g\u0303\u00b5\u03bd take the canonical GR form\nR\u00b5\u03bd(g\u0303)\u2212 1\n2 g\u0303\u00b5\u03bdR(g\u0303) =\n1\nM2P T (eff)\u00b5\u03bd (2.15)\nwith the same Newton constant as in the original frame. Here R\u00b5\u03bd(g\u0303) and R(g\u0303) are the Ricci tensor and the scalar curvature of the metric g\u0303\u00b5\u03bd , respectively. Therefore the set of dynamical variables using the metric g\u0303\u00b5\u03bd can be called the Einstein frame. T (eff) \u00b5\u03bd on the right side of the Einstein equations (2.15) is the TMT effective energy-momentum tensor, the occurrence\n4Note that the model should not allow the possibility for \u03b6 to cross the value -1, since this would mean a change in the sign of the volume measure in the primordial action (2.1). Using the form of V (\u03c6), Eq.(1.3), we see that \u03b6(\u03c6)\u2192 \u22121 as \u03c6\u2192\u221e.\n\u2013 7 \u2013\nof which is described in Appendix A as step 6 in the TMT procedure. In the model under study, T (eff)\u00b5\u03bd has the form\nT (eff)\u00b5\u03bd = 1\n1 + \u03be \u03c6 2\nM2P\n(\u03c6,\u00b5\u03c6,\u03bd \u2212 g\u0303\u00b5\u03bdX\u03c6) + g\u0303\u00b5\u03bdUeff (\u03c6, \u03b6(\u03c6);M), where X\u03c6 = 1\n2 g\u0303\u03b1\u03b2\u03c6,\u03b1\u03c6,\u03b2; (2.16)\nthe TMT effective potential Ueff (\u03c6, \u03b6(\u03c6);M) appears as the following function of \u03c6 and the integration constantM\nUeff (\u03c6, \u03b6(\u03c6);M) = 1(\n1 + \u03be \u03c6 2\nM2P\n)2 [V2 + M\u2212 V1 \u2212 V2[1 + \u03b6(\u03c6)]2 ] , (2.17)\nwhere \u03b6(\u03c6) is determined by the constraint (2.10). The role of the non-minimal coupling in the flattening of the inflationary potential and in the attractor for inflation at strong coupling is well known [11]-[21], [53], [54]. It is\nnoteworthy that in addition to the factor ( 1 + \u03be \u03c6 2\nM2P\n)\u22122 generated by a non-minimal coupling,\nU(\u03c6, \u03b6(\u03c6);M) contains also the factor (1 + \u03b6(\u03c6))\u22122, the occurrence of which is due to the inherent properties of TMT. As we shall see, the fact that the plateau of the TMT effective potential has a finite length is one of the most important effects of the scalar \u03b6(\u03c6). If M 6= V1 + V2, after making use the constraint (2.10) the TMT effective potential Ueff (\u03c6, \u03b6(\u03c6);M) can be represented in the \u03b6-independent form\nUeff (\u03c6;M) = 1(\n1 + \u03be \u03c6 2\nM2P\n)2 [ V2 + [M\u2212 2V2 + V (\u03c6)]2\n4(M\u2212 V1 \u2212 V2)\n] . (2.18)\nRecall that V (\u03c6) is defined by Eq.(1.3). The presence of the factor (1+\u03b6)\u22122 in Ueff (\u03c6, \u03b6(\u03c6);M) causes V 2(\u03c6)/ ( 1 + \u03be\u03c62/M2P )2 to appear in Ueff (\u03c6;M), which for sufficiently large \u03c6 leads to a change in the shape of the TMT effective potential from plateau to steep rise (see also footnote 4). For further study, it is convenient to rewrite Ueff (\u03c6;M) by extracting a term equal to the value of Ueff (\u03c6;M) at \u03c6 = 0\n\u039b(M) = Ueff (\u03c6 = 0;M) = M2 \u2212 4V1V2\n4(M\u2212 V1 \u2212 V2) . (2.19)\nThen we get Ueff (\u03c6;M) = \u039b(M) + Veff (\u03c6;M), (2.20)\nwhere\nVeff (\u03c6;M) = 2(M\u2212 2V2)V (\u03c6) + [V (\u03c6)]2 4(M\u2212 V1 \u2212 V2) ( 1 + \u03be \u03c6 2\nM2P\n)2 \u2212 \u039b(M) 1\u2212 1(\n1 + \u03be \u03c6 2\nM2P\n)2  . (2.21)\nAfter passing to the Einstein frame in the inflaton equation (2.11) one must substitute the expression for the scalar curvature derived from the Einstein equations (2.15). And finally,\n\u2013 8 \u2013\nusing the constraint (2.10), we get the inflaton equation in the following form\n1\u221a g\u0303 \u2202\u00b5  1 1 + \u03be \u03c6 2\nM2P\n\u221a g\u0303g\u0303\u00b5\u03bd\u2202\u03bd\u03c6 + \u03be\u03c6 M2P ( 1 + \u03be \u03c6 2\nM2P )2 g\u0303\u03b1\u03b2\u2202\u03b1\u03c6\u2202\u03b2\u03c6 (2.22) + M\u2212 2V2 + V (\u03c6)\n2(M\u2212 V1 \u2212 V2) ( 1 + \u03be \u03c6 2\nM2P\n)2V \u2032(\u03c6)\u2212 \u03be\u03c6 M2P ( 1 + \u03be \u03c6 2\nM2P\n)3 [ [M\u2212 2V2 + V (\u03c6)]2\nM\u2212 V1 \u2212 V2 + 4V2\n] = 0."

            "text": "The arbitrariness in the value of the integration constantM allows one to study cosmological models with an arbitrary cosmological constant. In this paper, we will restrict ourselves to a model with zero vacuum energy density, which is a fairly good approximation when studying the inflationary epoch. If \u03c6 = 0 is the position of the global minimum of the TMT effective potential Ueff (\u03c6;M) described by Eqs.(2.18)-(2.21), i.e. \u03c6 = 0 is the vacuum state of the classical scalar field \u03c6(x), then \u039b(M) is the cosmological constant. As can be seen from Eqs.(2.10) and (1.3), in the vacuum the expression for the scalar \u03b6 has the form\n\u03b6v = M\u2212 2V1 M\u2212 2V2 . (2.23)\nThe zero value of the cosmological constant is reached if the integration constantM satisfies the relation M20 = 4V1V2, (2.24) where the subscript 0 indicates that \u039b(M0) = 0. To ensure the possibility of \u039b(M0) = 0, the model parameters V1 and V2 must have the same sign. It can be shown by direct detailed verification that results of interest are obtained if the parameters V1, V2 and the integration constantM0 are chosen so that\nV1 < 0; V2 < 0; M0 = 2 \u221a V1V2. (2.25)\nThen it follows from Eq.(2.23) that the value of \u03b6 in the vacuum with zero energy density is\n\u03b6v = \u221a V1 V2 > 0. (2.26)\nIn the chosen case of a zero cosmological constant, the TMT effective potential Ueff (\u03c6;M) defined by Eqs.(2.18)-(2.21) reduces to V (0)eff (\u03c6) def = Ueff (\u03c6;M0) = Veff (\u03c6;M0), which has the form\nV (0) eff (\u03c6) =\n1 (1 + \u03b6v) ( 1 + \u03be \u03c6 2\nM2P\n)2 [ V (\u03c6) + (V (\u03c6))2\n4|V2|(1 + \u03b6v)\n] (2.27)\nAccordingly, when choosing (2.25), the inflaton equation (2.22) reduces to\n1\u221a g\u0303 \u2202\u00b5  1 1 + \u03be \u03c6 2\nM2P\n\u221a g\u0303g\u0303\u00b5\u03bd\u2202\u03bd\u03c6 + \u03be\u03c6 M2P ( 1 + \u03be \u03c6 2\nM2P )2 g\u0303\u03b1\u03b2\u2202\u03b1\u03c6\u2202\u03b2\u03c6 + 2|V2|(1 + \u03b6v) + V (\u03c6)\n2|V2|(1 + \u03b6v)2 ( 1 + \u03be \u03c6 2\nM2P\n)2V \u2032(\u03c6)\u2212 \u03be\u03c6 (V (\u03c6))2 |V2|M2P (1 + \u03b6v)2 ( 1 + \u03be \u03c6 2\nM2P\n)3 = 0. (2.28)\n\u2013 9 \u2013\nFollowing the TMT procedure, we are left with the 7th step. Namely, it is necessary to make sure that Eq.(2.28) for the inflaton field and the Einstein equations (2.15) with the energy-momentum tensor T (eff)\u00b5\u03bd described by Eqs.(2.16)-(2.18) with \u039b(M0) = 0 and (2.27) are self-consistent. This can be done if these equations can be obtained from some effective action. As usual, if g\u0303\u03b1\u03b2\u03c6,\u03b1\u03c6,\u03b2 > 0, the energy-momentum tensor T (eff) \u00b5\u03bd can be rewritten in the form of a perfect fluid. Then the pressure density plays the role of the Lagrangian in the effective action. Thus we come to the following TMT effective action\nSeff = \u222b \u2212M2P 2 R(g\u0303) +\n1 2 ( 1 + \u03be \u03c6 2\nM2P\n) g\u0303\u03b1\u03b2\u03c6,\u03b1\u03c6,\u03b2 \u2212 V (0)eff (\u03c6)) \u221a\u2212g\u0303d4x (2.29)\nIt can be checked by direct calculations that the variation of Seff with respect to the fields g\u0303\u00b5\u03bd and \u03c6 actually leads to Eqs.(2.28) and (2.15) with T (eff)\u00b5\u03bd described by Eqs.(2.16)-(2.18) and (2.27) (with \u039b = 0). To compare the predictions of the model under study with numerous models developed to describe inflationary cosmology, it is necessary to pass to the canonically normalized scalar field. It turns out that the most interesting results are obtained if the non-minimal coupling constant \u03be is positive. Therefore, in addition to choosing negative values of the model parameters V1 and V2 and the integration constant M0 = 2 \u221a V1V2, (see Eq.(2.25)), we will study the results of the model obtained for \u03be > 0. Then the canonically normalized scalar field \u03d5 can be easily found by solving the equation d\u03c6d\u03d5 = \u221a 1 + \u03be \u03c6 2\nM2P , which gives\n\u03c6\nMP = 1\u221a \u03be sinh\n(\u221a \u03be \u03d5\nMP\n) . (2.30)\nThe action (2.29) is then given by\nSeff =\n\u222b ( \u2212 M2P\n2 R(g\u0303) +\n1 2 g\u0303\u03b1\u03b2\u03d5,\u03b1\u03d5,\u03b2 \u2212 V (0) eff (\u03c6(\u03d5))\n)\u221a \u2212g\u0303d4x, (2.31)\nwhere, after inserting the primordial potential (1.3), the TMT effective potential expressed in terms of the canonically normalized field \u03d5, V (0)eff (\u03d5) = V (0) eff (\u03c6(\u03d5)), has the form\nV (0) eff (\u03d5) = M4P (1 + \u03b6v)\u03be tanh4z\n[ \u03bb\n4\u03be +\nm4\n16\u03be|V2|(1 + \u03b6v) +\nm2\n2M2P \u00b7 sinh 2z\n+ \u03bbm2M2P\n16\u03be2|V2|(1 + \u03b6v) sinh2z + \u03bb2M4P 64\u03be3|V2|(1 + \u03b6v) sinh4z\n] , (2.32)\nwhere z = \u221a \u03be \u03d5MP . In the next subsection, we will see the need to compare the model under study with the \u03b1-atttactor models[22]-[31], [1]. Here it is worth paying attention to the difference between the change of variables \u03c6\u2192 \u03d5 described by Eq.(2.30) and the change \u03c6\u2192 \u03d5 in the \u03b1-atttactor models. In this regard, the models are fundamentally different. In \u03b1-atttactor models, the kinetic term of the non-canonical scalar field \u03c6 has a pole at the boundary of the moduli space. On the contrary, in the model under study, when \u03be > 0 is chosen, the noncanonical scalar field \u03c6 in the TMT effective action (2.29) does not contain a pole. This difference is insignificant in the limit of \u03d5 \u2192 0: in both models \u03c6 \u2192 0 as \u03d5 \u2192 0. But for \u03d5 \u2192 \u221e,\n\u2013 10 \u2013\nthe corresponding behavior of \u03c6 in these models is completely different. In the TMT model under study, \u03c6 also tends to infinity. In \u03b1-atttactor models, the canonical scalar field tends to infinity when the original non-canonical scalar field tends to the boundary of the moduli space.\nIn the zero cosmological constant case, the constraint (2.10) presented in terms of the canonically normalized field \u03d5 takes the form\n\u03b6 = 2|V2|\u03b6v(1 + \u03b6v)\u2212\nm2M2P 2\u03be sinh 2 z \u2212 \u03bb 4\u03be2 M4P sinh 4 z\n2|V2|(1 + \u03b6v) + m2M2P 2\u03be sinh 2 z + \u03bb 4\u03be2 M4P sinh\n4 z , where z =\n\u221a \u03be \u03d5\nMP .

            "heading": "2.3 Model parameters and preliminary discussion of the obtained modification of the T-model potential",
            "text": "The model contains 5 parameters: m2 > 0, \u03bb > 0, \u03be > 0, V1 < 0 and V2 < 0. This allows us to hope that by fitting the parameters it will be possible to obtain agreement between the predictions of the model and the existing observational data (and, possibly, future ones). But in this paper we will restrict ourselves to studying the possibilities of solving the problem of the initial conditions for inflation and its connection with the problem of the initial cosmological singularity.\nAs we have seen, if \u03c6 = 0 is a vacuum state with zero energy density, then, instead of the parameter V1, it is convenient to use the parameter \u03b6v defined by Eq.(2.26). As noted above, the canonical variable \u03d5 = 0 when \u03c6 = 0. Expanding the TMT effective potential (2.32) near \u03d5 = 0 we obtain the following expression for the square of the inflaton effective mass\nm2eff = m2\n1 + \u03b6v . (2.34)\nAssuming that the parameter |V1| does not exceed the parameter |V2|, we obtain from Eq.(2.26)\n0 < \u03b6v \u2264 1 (2.35)\nAs a numerical estimate, let us take the mass of the inflaton meff \u2248 2 \u00b7 1013GeV . Then for the mass parameter m we have\nm \u223c 1013GeV. (2.36)\nThe first two terms in square brackets in (2.32) are responsible for the start of the plateau when \u03d5MP \u2265 1\u221a \u03be . The last two terms in (2.32) are responsible for the end of the plateau and the beginning of the almost exponential growth of V (0)eff (\u03d5). By adjusting the model parameters, one can move the value of \u03d5 at which the latter occurs to provide constraints on the initial conditions for a quasi-dS inflation. We notice that by choosing the value of the non-minimal coupling parameter \u03be = 16 (opposite in sign to the parameter of the conformal coupling ), we obtain an effective potential constructed from the hyperbolic functions like tanh \u03d5\u221a\n6MP , depending on the same combination\n\u03d5\u221a 6MP as in the simplest T-Model obtained in the conformal theory [22]. A more general case of the single field \u03b1 attractor models [24], where the hyperbolic functions depend on the combination \u03d5\u221a\n6\u03b1MP , corresponds to the choice \u03be = 16\u03b1 in the model of this paper.\n\u2013 11 \u2013\neff (\u03d5\u2217) do not depend on q, and for the chosen parameters V\n(0)\neff (\u03d5\u2217) exceeds the plateau height by\napproximately 1.5 times. The latter means that at the very beginning, inflation can be driven by a scalar field with an almost exponentially growing potential.\nFor the plateau height of V (0)eff (\u03d5) to satisfy the constraint on the inflationary energy scale [5], the choice of model parameters must ensure that\n1\n4(1 + \u03b6v)\u03be2\n[ \u03bb+\nm4\n4|V2|(1 + \u03b6v)\n] \u223c 10\u221210. (2.37)\nFor further evaluation, we must consider the possible range of the parameters |V2| and \u03bb. It is natural to assume that the vacuum-like parameters V1 and V2 can be of the order close or at least not much less than M4P . Using (2.36) one can conclude that\n\u2022 if \u03bb < m 4 4(1+\u03b6v)|V2| then (2.37) can be satisfied if |V2| . ( 1 2 \u00b7 10 16GeV )4;\n\u2022 if we prefer |V2| to be closer to the Planck scale, i.e. |V2| > (1016GeV )4, then there must be\n\u03bb 4\u03be2(1 + \u03b6v) \u223c 10\u221210, that is \u03bb \u223c 1 + \u03b6v \u03b12 \u00b7 10\u221211. (2.38)\nIn what follows, the last choice for \u03bb will be assumed.\nNow there is a need to discuss the parameters of the model in more detail. Note that with the chosen parameters m and \u03bb, the height of the potential energy plateau of the TMT effective potential V (0)eff (\u03d5), Eq.(2.32), is controlled mainly by \u03bb, and more precise tuning\n\u2013 12 \u2013\ncan be performed using \u03be and \u03b6v. The set of these four parameters, together with |V2| discussed below, provides a wide range of possibilities for adjusting the shape of V (0)eff (\u03d5) to the constraints imposed by current and future cosmological observations. By the number of model parameters, the effective TMT potential V (0)eff (\u03d5) is very different from the potential in the \u03b1-attractor models[24], where only two parameters (m and \u03b1) are present. However, this is not the only difference. Due to the presence of an almost exponentially growing \"tail\", V\n(0) eff (\u03d5) should be compared with the potential proposed by Linde in Ref.[1] as an example of a singular \u03b1-attractor model to solve the problem of initial conditions for inflation. After we have chosen estimates for the parameters m, \u03bb, \u03be, \u03b6v, the only remaining free parameter is V2 < 0. It is convenient to use the parametrization |V2| = (q \u00b7MP )4. In order to get an idea of the effect of a parameter |V2|, let us consider the following three cases: 1) q = 1, which corresponds to |V2| = M4P \u2248 (2.44 \u00b7 1018GeV )4; 2) q = 1 3 , which corresponds to |V2| \u223c 10\u22122M4P ; 3) q=0.1, which corresponds to |V2| = 10\u22124M4P \u2248 (2.44 \u00b7 1017GeV )4. For these three values of |V2|, the plots of the effective TMT potential (2.32) are shown in Fig.1. As can be seen, the larger |V2|, the greater the plateau length, and this dependence is very sensitive to changes in |V2|. Note that if instead of the scalar field model with the primordial potential (1.3) we choose a free massive scalar field \u03c6, i.e. \u03bb = 0, then, as can be seen from Eq.(2.32), the TMT effective potential would have an infinite plateau.\nFor \u221a\n2 3 \u03d5 MP\n> 1 we can restrict ourselves to the first degree of expansion in e\u2212 \u221a 2 3 \u03d5 MP\nand find, using the chosen estimates of the model parameters\nV (0) eff (\u03d5) \u2248 \u03bbM4P 4\u03be2(1 + \u03b6v)\n[ 1\u2212 8 ( 1 +O ( 10\u221210\nq4\n)) e \u2212 \u221a 2 3 \u03d5 MP +O ( e \u22122 \u221a 2 3 \u03d5 MP )] . (2.39)\nThis is a representation of the potential, which, with a negligible correction (and for \u03be = 16), coincides with the corresponding expansion in e\u2212 \u221a 2 3 \u03d5 MP of the potential V (\u03d5) \u221d tanh2n( 1\u221a\n6 \u03d5 MP )\nfor n=2 found in the paper [22] where it was named \"the T-model\". Thus, we can state that in the model we are studying, all inflationary predictions coincide with the corresponding predictions of the T-model and, therefore, are consistent with Planck\u2019s data to the same extent. In particular, if N is a number of remaining e-foldings of inflation at the time when the inflaton field \u03d5 = \u03d5(N), then \u03d5(N) is given by the equation (see e.g. [22])\ne 2 \u221a \u03be \u03d5(N) MP \u2248 32\u03beN. (2.40)\nFor all parameters used in graphs of Fig.1, it follows that \u03d5(60) \u2248 7.1MP . So, we found that when studying the simplest field theory model (1.3) with nonminimal coupling to gravity in the framework of the TMT in the Palatini formalism, the TMT effective potential of the canonically normalized inflaton arises, which 1) has a plateau, the length of which is controlled by the parameter V2; 2) when \u03d5 exceeds a certain value depending on V2, the potential passes from a flat shape to an almost exponential growth. At first glance, it seems that the modification of the T-model potential obtained in the simplest model (2.1) is reduced only to the appearance of an exponentially growing \"tail\". In fact, this is only partly true. Here TMT presents us with another surprise, which will be discovered and explored in the next subsections.\n\u2013 13 \u2013"

            "text": "A solution (2.7) of Eq.(2.4) exists under the condition \u03a5(x) 6= 0, Eq.(2.6), i.e, only if \u03a5(x) > 0 or only if \u03a5(x) < 0. Therefore, only those solutions of the system of equations obtained in the previous subsections are valid for which the corresponding \u03a5(x) is sign-definite, since Eq.(2.4) is one of the equations of the system 5 . It should be noted here that, as usual, by default we assume that the original metric g\u00b5\u03bd in the primordial action is regular, that is g = det(g\u00b5\u03bd) < 0. Therefore, the validity of the solution regarding the fulfillment of the condition on the sign of \u03a5 can be controlled by checking the sign of the scalar \u03b6 = \u03a5/ \u221a \u2212g. In particular, in the model under consideration, with our choice of parameters and constant of integration, the value of \u03b6 in vacuum, Eq(2.26), is positive: \u03b6v > 0. Thus, only those cosmological solutions (together with their initial conditions) are valid for which \u03b6(x) is positive throughout the evolution of the universe. However, these solutions lose their validity when we try to extend them to the values of \u03d5 where \u03b6 crosses zero and becomes negative. If we assume that \u03b6(\u03d5) vanishes at some value of \u03d5 = \u03d5\u2217, then this situation is of special interest, and a significant part of what follows will be devoted to its study. First of all, we should note that a more precise mathematical formulation is required. To understand the essence of the problem, we can restrict ourselves to the simplest model that we are currently studying, where \u03b6 determined by the constraint (2.33) depends only on \u03d5. But the reasoning given below is also valid in more general models, e.g. studied in Sec.3 and discussed in Sec.4. Let us assume that the solution of the field equations contains such a value of the field \u03d5 = \u03d5\u2217 for which a formal substitution into the constraint (2.33) gives \u03b6 = 0. But strictly speaking, we have no right to do this substitution because the constraint (2.33) was obtained under the condition \u03a5 6= 0 which is equivalent to \u03b6 6= 0. Consequetly, strictly speaking, we can only describe the situation using the right-hand limit \u03b6 \u2192 0 + (and, of course, \u03a5(x)\u2192 0 +), i.e.\nlim \u03d5\u2192\u03d5\u2212\u2217\n\u03b6 = 0. (2.41)\nNo less interesting is the question of the left-hand limit giving \u03b6 \u2192 0\u2212 (and, of course, \u03a5(x) \u2192 0\u2212). The answer and its consequences turn out to be very non-trivial and will be\n5Moreover, the solutions (2.7) for \u03a5(x) > 0 and for \u03a5(x) < 0 generally contain different integration constants; the case of solutions with equal integration constants is extremely improbable. In this regard, it is worth noting here the difference between the model under study, which uses the volume form dV\u03a5 = \u03a5d4x, Eq.(1.2), defined in terms of four scalar functions \u03d5a, from models that use the generally covariant measure of integration dV\u03a6 = \u03a6d4x with volume measure density of the form\n\u03a6 = 1\n3! \u00b5\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2\u2202\u00b5A\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 ,\nwhere A\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 is an auxiliary 3-index antisymmetric tensor gauge field. If the original action contains the term\u222b L\u03a6d4x with the corresponding Lagrangian L, then the variation with respect to A\u03bd\u03b1\u03b2 gives the solution L = M = const. without restrictions on the sign of \u03a6. Such an approach to choosing an alternative nonRiemannian measure of integration was used, for example, in models of Refs.[55]-[57], where the original actions contain more than one term of this kind with different 3-index antisymmetric tensor gauge fields. In such models, the scalar \u03a6\u221a\u2212g also appears, which plays a role similar to that of the scalar \u03b6 = \u03a5\u221a \u2212g in the model studied in this paper. But the essential difference of the model with the volume element dV\u03a6 = \u03a6d4x is that there is no need to require that the density \u03a6 of the volume measure dV\u03a6 be nonvanishing. The result of this is that a single integration constantM can be chosen for a global solution applicable in the entire space-time manifold. This type of model can be used to construct a non-singular emergent universe followed by inflation, as in Ref. [58], which continues the many attempts [59]-[62],[50] to implement the idea of a singularity-free inflationary universe. For further discussion of the possibility of a non-singular emergent universe, see, for example, Refs.

As a result, inflation can be driven from the very beginning by a scalar field with a potential, the shape of which differs little from a flat one. This is achieved by choosing \u03b6v = 0.2, which corresponds to choosing |V1| \u2248 0.04|V2| \u2248 (0.45qMP )4.\ndiscussed in Sec.4. But until then, we will focus on possible initial conditions for inflationary solutions to the cosmological equations. It follows from the above that those initial conditions for which \u03b6 \u2264 0 should be excluded from consideration as an artifact in our Universe. As we will see in the next subsection, this is exactly what happens in the model under study."

Hence \u03b6 > 0 for any \u03d5 < \u03d5\u2217, i.e. \u03d5\u2217 is the limiting upper bound of admissible values of \u03d5. Thus, for each of the curves in Fig. 1, the part of the TMT effective potential corresponding to the interval \u03d5 \u2265 \u03d5\u2217 is an artifact in our Universe. The TMT effective potential V\n(0) eff (\u03d5) remains finite as \u03d5 \u2192 \u03d5 \u2212 \u2217 , and it follows from the structure of the TMT effective energy-momentum tensor that, in any proximity to the hypersurface \u03b6(x) = 0 it has no singularities.\nInserting (2.43) into the effective potential (2.32) we obtain\nV (0) eff (\u03d5)|\u03b6\u22480 \u2248 lim\n\u03d5\u2192\u03d5\u2212\u2217 V\n(0) eff (\u03d5) \u2248 \u03bbM4P 4\u03be2(1 + \u03b6v)\n( 1 + 1\n2 \u03b6v\n) = ( 1 + 1\n2 \u03b6v\n) V\n(0) eff (\u03d5)|plateau, (2.44)\nwhere V (0)eff (\u03d5)|plateau is the typical hight of the plateau of the TMT effective potential at 1\n\u221a \u03be \u03d5MP < \u221a \u03be \u03d5\u2217MP . With the chosen parameters \u03b6v = \u221a V1/V2 \u2264 1, and we conclude that\nfor the initial value \u03d5in arbitrarily close to the limiting value \u03d5\u2217 (admissible by the condition \u03b6 > 0), the ratio of V (0)eff (\u03d5in) to the typical height of the plateau does not exceed 1.5 and the value of this ratio does not depend on |V2| = (qMP )4. As can be seen from the graphs in Fig.1, where \u03b6v = 1 is chosen, the evolution can begin when the effective TMT potential V\n(0) eff (\u03d5) has an almost exponentially growing shape. But in the TMT model under study, \u03d5in cannot exceed \u03d5\u2217, and, consequently, the TMT effective potential cannot exceed the value V\n(0) eff (\u03d5\u2217) M 4 P . Therefore, the scenario proposed by Linde for solving the problem of the initial conditions is not realizable in the model under study. As we will see, the more general model studied in Sec.3 may provide an alternative approach to solving the problem of initial conditions for inflation. However, here we restrict ourselves to demonstrating a simple way to avoid complicating the inflationary scenario caused by the almost exponentially growing part of V (0)eff (\u03d5). To do this, it is enough to use arbitrariness in the choice of the parameter |V1| or, what is the same, in the choice of \u03b6v, see Eq.(2.26). For example, if \u03b6v = 0.2, then V (0) eff (\u03d5\u2217) exceeds the typical plateau height by about 10%. In this case, when \u03d5in is close to \u03d5\u2217, inflation is driven from the very beginning by a scalar field with a potential, the shape of which differs little from a flat one. As an example with \u03b6v = 0.2, the plots of the TMT effective potentials V (0) eff (\u03d5) for four values of q are shown in Fig.2, where the points on the graphs corresponding to q-dependent values of \u03d5\u2217 are marked. Note that the value \u03b6v = 0.2 corresponds to the choice of |V1| \u2248 0.04|V2| \u2248 (0.45qMP )4. The qualitative conclusion following from these results is as follows: within the framework of the considered simplest model, there is a wide range of model parameters, where the theory forbids in our Universe the canonically normalized inflaton field \u03d5 to exceed the value, starting from which the potential has an exponentially growing \"tail\". Note that, as will be shown in Sec.3 and Appendix B, this conclusion can be violated if the initial gradient energy density is greater than the initial kinetic energy density.\n\u2013 16 \u2013\nTo complete the picture, we still need to make sure that \u03b6 remains positive during the entire time of cosmological evolution. To control the change in \u03b6 we need to know the sign of d\u03b6d\u03d5 . It follows from Eq.(2.30) that: 1) as \u03d5 > 0 also \u03c6 > 0; 2) d\u03c6 d\u03d5 > 0; 3)\nsign ( d\u03b6 d\u03d5 ) = sign ( d\u03b6 d\u03c6 ) . Therefore, to simplify the calculation, instead of d\u03b6d\u03d5 one can find d\u03b6 d\u03c6 . Using Eqs.(2.25) and (2.26) we obtain from the constraint (2.10)\nd\u03b6 d\u03c6 = \u2212 2|V2|(1 + \u03b6v) 2 [2|V2|(1 + \u03b6v) + V (\u03c6)]2 V \u2032(\u03c6). (2.45)\nEq.(1.3) shows that V \u2032(\u03c6) > 0 for \u03c6 > 0 and hence d\u03b6d\u03c6 < 0. Therefore, in the inflation process governed by a monotonically decreasing classical scalar field \u03d5 > 0, \u03b6(\u03d5) increases monotonically. The initial value \u03d5in, from which inflation starts, can be arbitrarily close to \u03d5\u2217, but it must be \u03d5in < \u03d5\u2217. Accordingly, \u03b6(\u03d5(t)) can start with a positive initial value \u03b6(\u03d5in) > 0, arbitrarily close to zero\n\u03b6(\u03d5in)\u2192 0+ as \u03d5in \u2192 \u03d5 \u2212\u2217 , (2.46)\nand \u03b6(\u03d5) increases monotonically during inflation. After the end of inflation, in the process of transition to the vacuum state, oscillations of \u03d5 can cause oscillations of \u03b6, but it remains positive and approaches its vacuum value \u03b6v > 0."

            "text": "As already mentioned in Sec.2.1, in the general case \u03a5 and \u221a \u2212g can enter the volume element with arbitrary coefficients. The choice of ( \u221a \u2212g+ \u03a5)d4x as the volume element in all gravity and matter terms, made in Sec.2.1, means that all results were obtained there with the most simplified approach to the choice of these coefficients. Therefore, it would be interesting to know what other new results can be obtained by abandoning such a simplification of the model. Bearing in mind the relevant discussion in Sec.2.1, we choose volume elements in the form (bi \u221a \u2212g + \u03a5) d4x, where bi is the model parameter corresponding to the i\u2019s term in the primordial action.\n\u2013 17 \u2013\nGeneralizing in this way the model studied so far, the primordial action can be represented as follows\nS = \u222b d4x [ \u2212 M2P\n2 ( \u221a \u2212g + \u03a5)\n( 1 + \u03be \u03c62\nM2P\n) R(\u0393, g) ] + \u222b d4x [ (bk \u221a \u2212g + \u03a5)1\n2 g\u03b1\u03b2\u03c6,\u03b1\u03c6,\u03b2 \u2212 (bp\n\u221a \u2212g + \u03a5)\n( 1\n2 m2\u03c62 +\n\u03bb 4 \u03c64 )]\n\u2212 \u222b d4x [\u221a \u2212gV1 +\n\u03a52\u221a \u2212g V2\n] , (3.2)\nwhere bk and bp are additional model parameters. Of course, this is not the most general action of this kind, because another parameter of the same type can be added to the volume element, coming with a non-minimal coupling. One can believe that the reason for the deviation of the parameters bk and bp from unity is quantum corrections. Then it is natural to assume that these corrections are small, and for further consideration we choose 0 < bk < 1 and 0.5 < bp < 1. But it is worth noting that in the calculations, the results of which are given below, the possible smallness of 1\u2212 bk and 1\u2212 bp is not used. It is known [47] that in TMT models with bk 6= 1 and bp 6= 1, the implementation of all seven steps of the TMT procedure listed in Appendix A leads to a TMT effective action with a structure typical for K-essence models [65]-[69]. Therefore, repeating again the TMT procedure in model (3.2), we quite expectedly come to a similar result. Following the prescription of the TMT procedure and similarly to what was done in Sec.2, we have to consider the equations of motion following from the primordial action (3.2). Varying the action with respect to scalar functions \u03d5a, from which \u03a5 is built, we obtain an equation that coincides with Eq.(2.4). Its solution is the same as in Eq.(2.7) if the same condition (2.6) is satisfied, i.e. everywhere \u03a5(x) 6= 0. But varying the action (3.2) with respect to the metric tensor g\u00b5\u03bd leads to equations that differ from Eq.(2.8) by the presence of additional parameters bk and bp. The requirement of the consistency of the obtained equations, unlike Eq.(2.10), now defines the scalar \u03b6(x) as a function which depends not only on \u03c6, but also on g\u03b1\u03b2\u03c6,\u03b1\u03c6,\u03b2 . That is why it is more convenient firstly to keep it in the form\n\u03b6 [ M\u2212 2V2 + V (\u03c6) + (1\u2212 bk) 1\n2 g\u03b1\u03b2\u03c6,\u03b1\u03c6,\u03b2\n] \u2212M+2V1+(2bp\u22121)V (\u03c6)+(1\u2212bk) 1\n2 g\u03b1\u03b2\u03c6,\u03b1\u03c6,\u03b2 = 0\n(3.3) and to represent in the final form only after transition to the Einstein frame. The latter is performed as in Eq.(2.14) where now \u03b6 = \u03b6(\u03c6, g\u03b1\u03b2\u03c6,\u03b1\u03c6,\u03b2). Thus, the constraint in the Einstein frame in the studying now model reads as follows\n\u03b6(\u03c6,X\u03c6) = M+ 2|V1| \u2212 (2bp \u2212 1)V (\u03c6)\u2212 (1\u2212 bk)\n( 1 + \u03be \u03c6 2\nM2P\n) \u00b7X\u03c6\nM+ 2|V2|+ V (\u03c6) + (1\u2212 bk) ( 1 + \u03be \u03c6 2\nM2P\n) \u00b7X\u03c6\n, X\u03c6 = 1\n2 g\u0303\u03b1\u03b2\u03c6,\u03b1\u03c6,\u03b2\n(3.4) The \u03c6-equation also contains parameters bk and bp. Instead of the function Ueff (\u03c6, \u03b6(\u03c6);M) obtained in Sec.2 and defined by Eq.(2.17), in the model with the action (3.2) we obtain\nUeff (\u03c6, \u03b6(\u03c6,X\u03c6);M) = 1(\n1 + \u03be \u03c6 2\nM2P\n)2 [M+ |V1|+ |V2|+ (1\u2212 bp)V (\u03c6)[1 + \u03b6(\u03c6,X\u03c6)]2 \u2212 |V2| ] , (3.5)\n\u2013 18 \u2013\nIn the space-time region, where \u03a5 > 0, we again choose the integration constant M as in Sec.2.2, i.e. according to Eq.(2.25), which provides zero vacuum energy density. The last fact will be marked with (0) in the notation of all relevant quantities. After passing to the Einstein frame in all other equations and using the redifinition (2.30) to the canonically normalized scalar field \u03d5, the expression for the TMT effective action takes the form\nS (0) eff =\n\u222b [ \u2212 M2P\n2 R(g\u0303) + L\n(0) eff (\u03c6(\u03d5), \u03b6(\u03d5,X\u03d5))\n]\u221a \u2212g\u0303d4x, (3.6)\nwhere the TMT effective Lagrangian for the scalar field \u03d5 appears as following\nL (0) eff (\u03c6(\u03d5), \u03b6(\u03d5,X\u03d5)) = X\u03d5 \u2212 U (0) eff (\u03c6(\u03d5), \u03b6(\u03d5,X\u03d5)), X\u03d5 =\n1 2 g\u0303\u03b1\u03b2\u03d5,\u03b1\u03d5,\u03b2 (3.7)\nand U (0)eff (\u03c6(\u03d5), \u03b6(\u03d5,X\u03d5)) in terms of \u03b6 = \u03b6(\u03d5,X\u03d5) reads\nU (0) eff (\u03c6(\u03d5), \u03b6(\u03d5,X\u03d5)) =\n1\ncosh4 z\n[ |V2|(1 + \u03b6v)2 + (1\u2212 bp)V (\u03c6(\u03d5))\n(1 + \u03b6)2 \u2212 |V2|\n] , (3.8)\nwhere z = \u221a \u03be \u03d5MP . Here \u03b6 = \u03b6(\u03d5,X\u03d5) is determined by the constraint following from Eq.(3.4)\nin which we have chosen the integration constantM0 = 2 \u221a V1V2 and used a redefinition (2.30) to a canonically normalized scalar field \u03d5:\n\u03b6(\u03d5,X\u03d5) = 2|V2|\u03b6v(1 + \u03b6v)\u2212 (2bp \u2212 1)\n[ m2M2P\n2\u03be sinh 2 z + \u03bb 4\u03be2 M4P sinh 4 z ] \u2212 (1\u2212 bk) cosh4 z \u00b7X\u03d5\n2|V2|(1 + \u03b6v) + m2M2P 2\u03be sinh 2 z + \u03bb 4\u03be2 M4P sinh\n4 z + (1\u2212 bk) cosh4 z \u00b7X\u03d5 (3.9)\nA significant difference from the simplest model studied in Sec.2 is that now \u03b6 turns out to be a function depending not only on \u03d5 but also on X\u03d5. Inserting \u03b6(\u03d5,X\u03d5) to Eq.(3.8) and using Eqs.(1.3) and (2.30) we obtain the final expression for the TMT effective Lagrangian of scalar field \u03d5, L(0)eff (\u03d5,X\u03d5) \u2261 L (0) eff (\u03c6(\u03d5), \u03b6(\u03d5,X\u03d5)), which can be represented in the following form, typical for K-essence models [65]-[69]\nL (0) eff (\u03d5,X\u03d5) = X\u03d5 \u2212 V (0) eff (\u03d5)\u2212K1(\u03d5)X\u03d5 \u2212K2(\u03d5) X2\u03d5 M4P , (3.10)\nwhere\nV (0) eff (\u03d5) = M4P 4\u03be2 tanh4z \u00b7 F (z), (3.11)\nF (z) = \u03bbq4(\u03b6v + bp) +\nm4\n4M4P + \u03bb4\u03be\nm2\nM2P sinh2z + \u03bb\n2\n16\u03be2 sinh4 z + 2\u03beq4(\u03b6v + bp)\nm2 M2P \u00b7 sinh\u22122 z (1 + \u03b6v)2q4 + (1\u2212 bp) ( 1 2\u03be m2\nM2P sinh2 z + \u03bb 4\u03be2 sinh4z ) , (3.12)\nK1(\u03d5) = 1\u2212 bk\n2 cosh2 z \u00b7\n8q4\u03be2(1 + \u03b6v) + 2\u03be m2 M2P \u00b7 sinh2 z + \u03bb sinh4 z\n4q4\u03be2(1 + \u03b6v)2 + 2(1\u2212 bp)\u03be m 2 M2P \u00b7 sinh2 z + \u03bb(1\u2212 bp) sinh4 z\n, (3.13)\nK2(\u03d5) = (1\u2212 bk)2 4 [ q4(1 + \u03b6v)2 + 1\u2212bp 2\u03be m2 M2P \u00b7 sinh2 z + \u03bb(1\u2212bp) 4\u03be2 sinh4 z ] . (3.14)\n\u2013 19 \u2013\nin \u2248 12.6MP (corresponding point is not marked\nhere).\nAs can be seen from Eqs.(3.11), (3.12), the choice of bp 6= 1 radically changes the behavior of V (0)eff (\u03d5) at \u03d5\u226bMP . Fig.3 and Fig.4 show two examples where instead of almost exponential unlimited growth, which was at bp = 1, a second plateau appears. In Fig.3, where bp = 0.7 is chosen, the second plateau is about 1.33 times higher than the first plateau. But on the graph of V (0)eff (\u03d5) in Fig.4, due to the choice of bp \u2248 0.5, the height of the second plateau exceeds the height of the first plateau by about 1.03 times.\nIf X\u03d5 = 0, then, as in the case of bp = 1 in Sec.2, there exists a value \u03d50 such that the infinite interval \u03d5 > \u03d50 is also an artifact. To show this, we first note, using the constraint (3.9), that at the minimum of V (0)eff (\u03d5), i.e. for \u03d5(x) \u2261 0, scalar \u03b6 has the same value \u03b6v > 0 as defined by Eq.(2.26). Therefore, throughout the entire process of cosmological evolution, \u03b6 must be positive. This was of paramount importance in the previous section and will be equally important for all subsequent analysis. Now, given the constraint (3.9) when X\u03d5 = 0, we see that \u03b6 \u2192 0+ when \u03d5\u2192 \u03d5 \u22120 where \u03d50 is defined by the relation\nsinh4 \u221a \u03be \u03d50 MP = 8q4\u03be2\u03b6v(1 + \u03b6v) \u03bb(2bp \u2212 1) (3.15)\nobtained after neglecting a very small correction from the term \u221d sinh2 \u221a \u03be \u03d50MP . This is a generalization of the definition of \u03d5\u2217, Eq.(2.43), to the case bp 6= 1. For the parameters used in the plot in Fig.3, relation (3.15) gives \u03d50 \u2248 12.9MP . For the parameters used in the plot in Fig.4, relation (3.15) gives \u03d50 \u2248 13.7MP . The corresponding points on the curves are marked with dots.\n\u2013 20 \u2013\n1 6\u03b1 , that is \u03b1 = 0.926, \u03b6v = 0.2, bp = 0.5 + 10 \u22126, bk = 0.5, \u03bb = 2.9 \u00b7 10\u221211, m \u2248 2 \u00b7 1013GeV . The two dots on the plot correspond to \u03d50 \u2248 13.7MP defined by relation (3.15) and \u03d5(min)in \u2248 6.8MP defined by Eq.(B.7)."

            "text": "The standard, non-TMT, formulation of the initial conditions for inflation driven by a scalar field includes specifying or at least estimating the initial value of the field \u03d5in and its first derivatives or, equivalently, the initial kinetic energy density \u03c1kin,in and the gradient energy density \u03c1grad,in. It is fundamentally important and taken for granted that there is no dependence in any form between \u03d5in and \u03c1kin,in, as well as between \u03d5in and \u03c1grad,in. In the simplest model of Sec.2, although there is a restriction on the initial values of \u03d5in < \u03d5\u2217 (following from the condition \u03b6 > 0), no restrictions on \u03c1kin,in and \u03c1grad,in appear. But in the more general model with action (3.2), the scalar \u03b6 given by the constraint (3.9) turns out to depend not only on \u03d5, but also on X\u03d5 = 12 g\u0303\n\u03b1\u03b2\u03d5,\u03b1\u03d5,\u03b2 .

But in doing this analysis, we will have to take into account the significant difference between how kinetic \u03c1kin and gradient \u03c1grad energy densities enter\n\u2013 21 \u2013\nEinstein\u2019s equations and the constraint (3.9) (and hence the inequality (3.16)). Indeed, while the kinetic and gradient energy densities enter the Einstein equations in the form of a sum, they enter the constraint in the form\nX\u03d5 = 1\n2 g\u0303\u03b1\u03b2\u03d5,\u03b1\u03d5,\u03b2 =\n1\n2\n( \u03d5\u03072 \u2212 1\na2 (\u2207\u03d5)2\n) = \u03c1kin \u2212 \u03c1grad, (3.17)\nthat is, in fact, in the form of a difference. Therefore, X(in)\u03d5 can be positive or negative depending on how inhomogeneous and anisotropic at the beginning of inflation was the space domain whose expansion generates our Universe 6. Since the sign of X(in)\u03d5 can significantly affect the results obtained from the condition \u03b6 > 0, the cases X(in)\u03d5 > 0 and X (in) \u03d5 < 0 are examined separately in the Appendix B.

But reasoning in the spirit of chaotic inflation, we can consider \u03d5in as a random variable, and then the two above examples with the choice of parameters show a significant difference. Given that a significant part of the potential is flat, without claiming good accuracy of estimates, we can assume that the probability has a flat prior distribution. As can be seen from Eqs.(3.7)-(3.14), the TMT effective Lagrangian and \u03b6(\u03d5,X\u03d5) do not change under the replacement \u03d5 \u2192 \u2212\u03d5. Therefore, we can restrict ourselves to positive \u03d5 only. Then, with the parameters used in Fig.3, one can find a rough estimate of the probability of occurrence of initial conditions that guarantee the onset of inflation as (12.9 \u2212 12.6)/12.9 \u2248 0.023. But a similar estimate with the parameters used in Fig.4 gives (13.7\u22126.8)/13.7 \u2248 0.5, which is a more than optimistic estimate for the probability of occurrence of initial conditions that guarantee the onset of inflation.\nWe must keep in mind that the described conclusions follow from the analysis of the model (3.2) if the integration constantM is chosen so that the cosmological constant is equal to zero (see Eqs.(2.19) and (2.25))."

            "text": "\u03a5(x) = 0\nIn the models of Secs.2 and 3, after solving Eq.(2.4), we came to a key conclusion: the dynamics of the models dictates that nontrivial solutions exist only when the measure density \u03a5(x) 6= 0 and, therefore, \u03a5(x) must be sign-definite. However, after examining the models, we found that the hypersurface \u03a5(x) = 0 does indeed exist. This means that the hypersurface \u03a5(x) = 0 separates the space-time manifoldM4 into two regions with \u03a5(x) > 0 and \u03a5(x) < 0, and we must study equations and their solutions in these regions independently of each other. These two regions can be considered as submanifolds of M4 with a common boundary \u03a5(x) = 0. In what follows we will use the notations M (+)4 and M (\u2212) 4 for the submanifolds with \u03a5(x) > 0 and \u03a5(x) < 0 respectively. Studying the equations inM (+)4 , we have chosen an arbitrary integration constantM to\nbeM0 = 2 \u221a V1V2, Eq.(2.25). This choice ensures that 1) the vacuum of the classical scalar field \u03d5 is at \u03d5 = 0; 2) the vacuum energy density is zero; 3) the corresponding equations describe an inflationary model satisfying the Planck\u2019s constraint. The zero value of the cosmological constant and possibility of an oscillatory regime of approaching \u03d5 to its vacuum state allows us to treat this model as the inflationary model of our Universe. Note that by a small deviation from the choice M0 one can provide a tiny cosmological constant. But this evidently has negligible effect in the inflationary epoch. As a result of the condition \u03a5(x) > 0, or equivalently \u03b6(x) > 0, in Sec.3 and in Appendix B we discovered that, if X\u03d5 > 0, there exists an upper bound \u03d50 on admissible values of the inflaton field \u03d5 for which\n\u03a5 \u2261 \u03b6(\u03d5,X\u03d5) \u00b7 \u221a \u2212g \u2192 0+ and X\u03d5 \u2192 0+ as \u03d5\u2192 \u03d5 \u22120 . (4.1)\nIn Sec. 2.4 we have already made an important remark that in the context of the dynamics of the models under consideration, we can describe the hypersurface \u03a5(x) = 0 only in a limiting way, as in Eq. (4.1) (or, which is the same, in terms of \u03b6, as in Eq.(2.46) where \u03d5\u2217 should be replaced by \u03d50). If we return to Eq.(2.4) and assume the possibility of \u03a5 = 0 when solving it, then, at first glance, the remaining equations on this hypersurface simply describe\n\u2013 25 \u2013\na different dynamics. But it turns out that this notion is erroneous and the reason for this is a new unexpected property on the boundary (the metric tensor has a discontinuity), which will be studied in Sec.4.3. For the time being, the final conclusion, important for what will be discussed below, is that in the submanifoldM (+)4 due to the choice of the integration constant M0 we are dealing with a model of our Universe with the boundary condition (4.1). In what follows, for brivety, we will call the latter as \"the boundary condition (\u03d50;X\u03d5 = 0; [M0])\", where [M0] is included to keep in mind that, in accordance with the constraint (3.9) and Eq.(3.15), the value of \u03d50 is determined by the choice of the integration constant. Recall that the vacuum value \u03b6v present in (3.9) and (3.15) is uniquely determined by the integration constant (see Eqs.(2.23)-(2.26)). Let us now turn to the results of studying the model of Sec.3, according to which, for the beginning of inflation it is enough that X(in)\u03d5 > 0 and the initial value \u03d5in of the inflaton field lies in the interval \u03d5(min)in \u2264 \u03d5in < \u03d50, where \u03d5 (min) in is defined in Eq.(B.7). In addition, in this interval of \u03d5in, the TMT effective potential has a plateau-like shape and X (in) \u03d5 is less than the plateau height. Therefore, we can assume that the Universe inflates in the slow-roll regime. The condition X\u03d5 > 0 means that the normal vectors \u2202\u03b1\u03d5 to all hypersurfaces described by the equations \u03d5(x) = constant are timelike and consequently, the hypersurfaces \u03d5(x) = constant are spacelike. All of the above remains true for \u03d5(x) arbitrarily close to \u03d50. To find out the geometric properties of the hypersurface \u03a5(x) = 0, we must, given the definition \u03a5(x) \u2261 \u03b6(x) \u221a \u2212g(x), study what happens to \u03b6(x) \u2261 \u03b6(\u03d5(x), X\u03d5) when \u03d5(x) \u2192 \u03d50. In doing this analysis, we must not forget that \u03d5(x) and X\u03d5 are considered independent of each other and serve as initial values for inflation. Therefore, it would be wrong to conclude that X\u03d5 \u2192 0 because \u03d5(x) \u2192 \u03d50 = const. But we can take into account the very nontrivial result7 containing in Eq.(4.1): X\u03d5 > 0 decreases to 0 when \u03d5(x) \u2192 \u03d5 \u22120 . Therefore, for values of \u03d5(x) very close to \u03d50 the function \u03b6(\u03d5(x), X\u03d5) can be considered approximately as a function depending only on \u03d5(x): \u03b6(\u03d5(x), X\u03d5) \u2248 \u03b6(\u03d5(x)). Hence, for \u03d5(x) \u2248 \u03d50 the equation \u03b6(\u03d5(x)) = constant describes a spacelike hypersurface. The latter remains true when \u03d5(x) \u2192 \u03d5 \u22120 (which is accompanied by constant \u2192 0). Therefore, the hypersurface \u03a5(x) \u2261 \u03b6(x) \u221a \u2212g(x) = 0 is a space-like boundary of the submanifold M (+)4 ."

            "text": "Trying to understand the nature of the boundary \u03a5 = 0, we must apparently turn to some basic mathematical definitions and propositions known in the theory of smooth manifolds. It seems that the most appropriate way to understand the problem we are facing is to discuss the orientability of a manifold. As is well known, the orientation of the differentiable manifold can be defined by the coordinate atlas (collection of maps). But n-dimensional differentiable manifolds (with or without boundary) allow one to define an orientation in an equivalent way using the nform (see, for example, Chapter 15 in the textbook [70]). Here it is appropriate to recall the following mathematical proposition, which holds for a differentiable manifolds with and without boundary, see e.g. Proposition 15.5 in Ref. [70]. Applied to M4, the proposition is: Any smooth nonvanishing 4-form \u03c9 on M4 determines a unique orientation of M4 for which \u03c9 is positively oriented at each point. Conversely, if an orientation is given on M4, then there\n7For a comparison with constraints to the initial values of \u03d5(x) and X\u03d5 if X\u03d5 < 0, see Sec.3.3.2.\n\u2013 26 \u2013\nis a smooth nonvanishing 4-form on M4 that is positively oriented at each point. A similar proposition is true, of course, for a negatively oriented 4-form \u03c9 on M4. In the TMT model under study, such a 4-form is dV\u03a5 = \u03a5d4x defined by Eq.(1.2). Thus, the submanifold M (+) 4 (where \u03a5 > 0) and the submanifoldM (\u2212)4 (where \u03a5 < 0) have opposite spacetime orientations. Here it is very important to pay attention to the fact that, according to the proposition, the existence of the boundary \u03a5(x) = 0 separating the submanifolds M (+)4 and M (\u2212) 4 does not affect this conclusion. It is worth remembering that by applying the principle of least action to the primordial action (3.2), we mean, as usual, that all primordial variables (scalar field \u03c6, non-degenerate metric tensor g\u00b5\u03bd , the affine connection \u0393\u03bb\u00b5\u03bd , the functions \u03d5a and hence \u03a5) are defined globally on an orientable space-time manifold M4 and are smooth functions. In particular, this means that: 1) they are all continuous on M4; 2) one can choose the orientation of M4. The latter, according to the above proposition, should be expressed in the possibility of choosing a certain sign of \u03a5(x). As we have seen, in order to describe our Universe, when solving equations in the model under consideration, we had to put \u03a5(x) > 0, i.e. choose a positive orientation. Based on our experience in field theory, we might naively expect this condition to still hold globally on M4. However, it turns out that this is not the case due to the dynamics of the model. The reason for this phenomenon is a very profound change introduced by TMT into field theory: as a result of the inclusion of the variables \u03d5a (from which \u03a5(x) is built) into the principle of least action, the possibility arises of mutual influence of the matter field dynamics and the continuous function \u03a5(x) or, in other words, between matter and such a fundamental property of the space-time manifold as orientability. This fundamentally new dynamical effect can lead to the creation of a hypersurface \u03a5(x) = 0 in M4 , which, as we have seen, can in turn impose significant restrictions on the dynamics of mater fields. The creation of the hypersurface \u03a5(x) = 0 (despite the fact that originally \u03a5(x) was nonvanishing on M4) and the splitting of M4 into two submanifolds M (+) 4 and M (\u2212) 4 with the opposite orientation means that M4 is not oriented anymore. Since this effect is the result of solving dynamical equations, it can be interpreted as spontaneous violation of the orientability of M4. Moreover, we found that the dynamically arisen spacelike hypersurface \u03a5(x) = 0 does not allow extension of solutions for \u03d5(t) from \u03d5(t) < \u03d50 to \u03d5(t) \u2265 \u03d50. Note that this effect can also be described in terms of the original scalar field \u03c6, because the replacement (2.30) of the original scalar field \u03c6 by the canonically normalized \u03d5 does not depend on \u03b6. Therefore, the origin of this effect has nothing to do with the redefinition (2.30) from \u03c6 to \u03d5."

            "text": "When solving Eq.(2.4) in the submanifold M (\u2212)4 (that is in the region with \u03a5 < 0), nothing definite can be said based on what was done in the submanifold M (+)4 . The reason is that the equations obtained by performing the TMT procedure essentially depend on the choice of the integration constant M, which appears in Eq.(2.7) under the condition \u03a5(x) 6= 0, Eq.(2.6). Generally speaking, there is no reason for the values ofM on both sides of the hypersurface \u03a5(x) = 0 to be equal. After we have implemented in M (+)4 the conditions for the inflationary scenario of our Universe by choosing the integration constantM0 = 2 \u221a V1V2, we would like to have at least some information about possible scenarios in M (\u2212)4 . Since the integration\n\u2013 27 \u2013\nconstant enters into all equations of the model, it is quite expected that the choice ofM can radically affect vacuum states and cosmological dynamics in regions with the opposite sign of \u03a5. The absence of information about possible scenarios in M (\u2212)4 means that the integration constant in the region with \u03a5(x) < 0 can have any real value, and hence the existence of a continuum of different solutions in M (\u2212)4 is possible. Therefore, solutions with the same integration constantM0 = 2 \u221a V1V2 as in the region with \u03a5(x) > 0 have zero measure in the space of all possible solutions with \u03a5(x) < 0. That is why we will not consider them further. Perhaps more detailed knowledge about possible cosmological scenarios in M (\u2212)4 is of interest. However, in this paper, we will not engage in additional reasoning in this direction and confine ourselves to a discussion of what happens on the boundary \u03a5(x) = 0. The difference in cosmological dynamics in regions with the opposite sign of \u03a5, in particular, means that one-sided boundary conditions on the hypersurface \u03a5(x) = 0 (i.e., in M (+)4 and M\n(\u2212) 4 ) are also different in the general case. It turns out that the study of this aspect of the model leads to an important conclusion, which we will now deal with. In what follows, to avoid confusion, in the submanifold M (\u2212)4 we will use the upper symbol \u2019check\u2019 in the notation for the integration constant, the metric in the Einstein frame, the inflaton field and its derivatives, like M\u030c, \u02c7\u0303g\u00b5\u03bd , \u03d5\u030c, X\u030c\u03d5\u030c = 12 \u02c7\u0303g\n\u03b1\u03b2\u03d5\u030c,\u03b1\u03d5\u030c,\u03b2 . Let us start by summarizing some of the main results that follow from the general\nformulation of the model described by Eqs.(3.2)-(3.5) when we apply them to the submanifold M\n(\u2212) 4 , that is in the region with \u03a5 < 0. In the case of an arbitrary integration constant M\u030c, the constraint in the Eistein frame in terms of the canonically normalized scalar field \u03d5\u030c follows from Eq.(3.4) and, instead of Eq.(3.9), it has the form as follows\n\u03b6(\u03d5\u030c, X\u030c\u03d5\u030c) = M\u030c+ 2|V1| \u2212 (2bp \u2212 1)\n[ m2M2P\n2\u03be sinh 2 z\u030c + \u03bb 4\u03be2 M4P sinh 4 z\u030c ] \u2212 (1\u2212 bk) cosh4 z\u030c \u00b7 X\u030c\u03d5\u030c\nM\u030c+ 2|V2|+ m2M2P 2\u03be sinh 2 z\u030c + \u03bb 4\u03be2 M4P sinh\n4 z\u030c + (1\u2212 bk) cosh4 z\u030c \u00b7 X\u030c\u03d5\u030c (4.2)\nwhere z\u030c = \u221a \u03be \u03d5\u030cMP . The transition to the Einstein frame, Eq.(2.14), expressed via the canonically normalised scalar field in M (+)4 is described by the relation\ng\u0303\u00b5\u03bd = [1 + \u03b6(\u03d5,X\u03d5)]\n( 1 + sinh2 \u221a \u03be \u03d5\nMP\n) g\u00b5\u03bd . (4.3)\nand in M (\u2212)4 - by the relation\n\u02c7\u0303g\u00b5\u03bd = [1 + \u03b6(\u03d5\u030c, X\u030c\u03d5\u030c)] ( 1 + sinh2 \u221a \u03be \u03d5\u030c\nMP\n) g\u00b5\u03bd . (4.4)\nAs is seen from Eq.(4.4) in order to ensure non-degeneracy of the physical metric tensor \u02c7\u0303g\u00b5\u03bd we have to prevent a possibility for \u03b6 to take the value -1 (see also the important remark made in footnote 4). This means that a set of configurations of the values M\u030c, \u03d5\u030c and X\u030c\u03d5\u030c for which the right side of Eq.(4.2) equals -1 has to be excluded from consideration. But it is clear that such a set has zero measure in the set of all possible values of these quantities. Similarly, the denominator in the right side of Eq.(4.2) can be equal to zero only for very special cases which also have zero measure in the set of all possible values of M\u030c, \u03d5\u030c and X\u030c\u03d5\u030c. Therefore, the scalar \u03b6 is finite for almost all possible values of these quantities. Combining\n\u2013 28 \u2013\nthe result that \u03a5 > 0 in M (+)4 , the continuity of \u03a5 which means that \u03a5 < 0 in M (\u2212) 4 , and the definition of \u03b6, Eq.(2.5), which in M (\u2212)4 lookes as\n\u03b6(\u03d5\u030c, X\u030c\u03d5\u030c) = \u03a5\u221a \u2212g , (4.5)\nwe obtain that \u03b6(\u03d5\u030c, X\u030c\u03d5\u030c) < 0 and \u03b6 \u2192 0\u2212 as \u03a5\u2192 0\u2212 and vice versa. Taking into account the condition \u03b6 6= \u22121, we find the following interval of admissible values of the continuous scalar function \u03b6(x) on M (\u2212)4\n\u2212 1 < \u03b6(\u03d5\u030c, X\u030c\u03d5\u030c) < 0 (4.6)\nNote that the structure of the TMT effective action inM (\u2212)4 is the same as inM (+) 4 and it\nis described by Eqs.(3.5)-(3.14). The only difference is that in M (+)4 the integration constant M = M0 = 2 \u221a V1V2 = 2\u03b60|V2|, while in M (\u2212)4 the integration constant M\u030c 6= M0. The function Ueff (\u03d5\u030c, \u03b6(\u03d5\u030c, X\u030c\u03d5\u030c);M\u030c) (from which the TMT effective potential inM (\u2212) 4 is extracted) has the same form as Ueff (\u03d5, \u03b6(\u03d5,X\u03d5);M) in Eq.(3.5), where one should replace \u03d5, \u03b6(\u03d5,X\u03d5), M with \u03d5\u030c, \u03b6(\u03d5\u030c, X\u030c\u03d5\u030c), M\u030c. Now we have enough information in order to discuss possible onesided boundary conditions on the hypersurface \u03a5(x) = 0 in M (\u2212)4 . For an arbitrary M\u030c and any finite values of \u03d5\u030c and X\u030c\u03d5\u030c, except for mentioned above very special cases, the function Ueff (\u03d5\u030c, \u03b6(\u03d5\u030c, X\u030c\u03d5\u030c);M\u030c) is finite. Therefore, for almost all values of M\u030c, \u03d5\u030c and X\u030c\u03d5\u030c, the metric tensor in the Einstein frame \u02c7\u0303g\u00b5\u03bd , obtained as a solution of the Einstein equations, is regular. To demonstrate a qualitatively new result of interest to us, namely, one-sided boundary conditions on the hypersurface \u03a5 = 0, we now need to study the conditions under which \u03a5\u2192 0\u2212. This happens if the numerator in Eq.(4.2) tends to zero as \u03d5\u030c tends to the corresponding value \u03d5\u030c0. To simplify the analysis, without losing the essence of the new effect, we can assume that X\u030c\u03d5\u030c \u2192 0 when \u03d5\u030c\u2192 \u03d5\u030c0 (this is similar to the boundary conditions for \u03a5\u2192 0 + in M (+)4 ). In addition, for simplicity of calculations, we can assume that\n\u221a \u03be \u03d5\u030c0MP 1 and neglect the\nterm \u221d sinh2 \u221a \u03be \u03d5\u030c0MP with respect to the term \u221d sinh 4\u221a\u03be \u03d5\u030c0MP . In this approximation, from Eq.(4.2) we obtain that for a given M\u030c, the limit value \u03d5\u030c0 is determined by the relation\nsinh4 \u221a \u03be \u03d5\u030c0 MP = 4\u03be2(M\u030c+ 2|V1|) \u03bb(2bp \u2212 1)M4P . (4.7)\nFollowing our agreement we will use (\u03d5\u030c0; X\u030c\u03d5\u030c = 0; [M\u030c]) for notation of these boundary conditions on the hypersurface \u03a5 = 0 in M (\u2212)4 . In the limit as \u03d5\u030c \u2192 \u03d5\u030c0 and X\u030c\u03d5\u030c \u2192 0, the function Ueff (\u03d5\u030c, \u03b6(\u03d5\u030c, X\u030c\u03d5\u030c);M\u030c) tends to the limiting value of the TMT effective potential on the hypersurface \u03a5(x) = 0\nUeff (\u03d5\u030c, \u03b6(\u03d5\u030c, X\u030c\u03d5\u030c);M\u030c) \u2212\u2192 \u03bbM4P 4\u03be2 \u00b7 bpM\u030c+ |V1| M\u030c+ 2|V1| . (4.8)\nThis limit which is obtained when \u03a5(x) \u2192 0\u2212 should be compared with the limit when \u03a5(x) \u2192 0 +. The latter is controlled by equations of Sec.3.1 when \u03d5 \u2192 \u03d5 \u22120 (and, according to Eq.(4.1), together with X\u03d5 \u2192 0 +) with the result\nU (0) eff (\u03d5, \u03b6(\u03d5,X\u03d5)) \u2212\u2192\n\u03bbM4P (2bp + \u03b6v)\n8\u03be2(1 + \u03b6v) . (4.9)\n\u2013 29 \u2013\nThe difference between these two limits, as a matter of fact, describes the difference between the one-sided boundary values of the energy momentum tensor on the space-like hypersurface \u03a5 = 0. Therefore, components of the Einstein tensor R\u00b5\u03bd(g\u0303)\u2212 12 g\u0303\u00b5\u03bdR(g\u0303) have jump discontinuity on this hypersurface. Using the relations describing the transformations to the Einstein frame (4.3) and (4.4) when \u03b6 \u2192 0, we obtain the explicit expression for the discontinuity of the metric tensor g\u0303\u00b5\u03bd on the hypersurface \u03a5 = 0\nlim \u03d5\u2192\u03d50 g\u0303\u00b5\u03bd \u2212 lim \u03d5\u030c\u2192\u03d5\u030c0 \u02c7\u0303g\u00b5\u03bd =\n[ sinh2 \u221a \u03be \u03d50 MP \u2212 sinh2 \u221a \u03be \u03d5\u030c0 MP ] g\u00b5\u03bd . (4.10)\nThus, we come to the conclusion that an inevitable consequence of the difference in the boundary conditions (\u03d50;X\u03d5 = 0; [M0]) and (\u03d5\u030c0; X\u030c\u03d5\u030c = 0; [M\u030c]) on the hypersurface \u03a5 = 0 (caused by the difference in the integration constants) is the appearance of a jump discontinuity of the metric tensor g\u0303\u00b5\u03bd on the hypersurface \u03a5 = 0. But along with the difference in the integration constants, there is another theoretical reason for the appearance namely of the metric tensor discontinuity. Indeed, as it follows from (4.10), in the absence of the nonminimal coupling, i.e. in the limit \u03be \u2192 0 the discontinuity of the metric disappears. However, since still M\u030c 6= M0 = 2 \u221a V1V2 and \u03d5\u030c0 6= \u03d50, it follows from Eqs.(4.8) and (4.9) that the jump discontinuity of the curvature is preserved in the limit \u03be \u2192 0. Note that in the limit \u03be \u2192 0 the model leads to a different dynamics, which is also quite regular, as one can see, for example, from Eqs.(3.4) and (3.5). Against the background of our experience in solving Einstein\u2019s equations, the boundary conditions obtained above at first glance look completely unacceptable and unnatural. But we must not forget that, unlike Einstein\u2019s GR, which is formulated globally on the entire manifold M4, here we are dealing with conditions on the boundary that separates two (sub)manifolds M\n(+) 4 and M (\u2212) 4 , and on each of them its own Einstein\u2019s GR is realized."

To simplify the analysis, we continue our study within the framework of the single-scalar field cosmological model, in which our Universe is considered as filling the entire submanifold with boundary M (+)4 , where \u03a5 > 0 and the boundary is the spacelike hypersurface \u03a5 = 0. This means that we completely ignore the options associated, for example, with a possible scenario of chaotic inflation. The main assumption is that at the beginning of the expansion of the Universe, the initial value X(in)\u03d5 > 0; recall that X\u03d5 is given by Eq.(3.17). If, in addition, the initial value \u03d5in of the scalar field lies in the interval \u03d5 (min) in \u2264 \u03d5in < \u03d50, then this is sufficient to fulfill the conditions (3.1) necessary for the onset of inflation. The assumption X(in)\u03d5 > 0 was also important to come to the conclusion that the hypersurface \u03a5 = 0 is spacelike. Thus, the initial conditions X(in)\u03d5 > 0 and \u03d5 (min) in \u2264 \u03d5in < \u03d50 not only ensure the beginning of inflation, but they are also consistent with the existence of a boundary in the form of the spacelike hypersurface \u03a5 = 0, due to which it is impossible to shift the initial value of the scalar field \u03d5in to the values \u03d5in \u2265 \u03d50. The discontinuity of the metric tensor g\u0303\u00b5\u03bd on the hypersurface \u03a5 = 0 means that the Christoffel connection coefficients {\u03bb\u00b5\u03bd} of the metric g\u0303\u00b5\u03bd are not defined on the hypersurface \u03a5 = 0. Consequently, in the inflating spacetime of the cosmological model under\n\u2013 30 \u2013\nstudy, timelike geodesics cannot be extended to the past beyond the spacelike hypersurface \u03a5 = 0. This conclusion agrees with the statement of the BGV theorem, and we have reason to assert that the hypersurface \u03a5 = 0 is the boundary B, which appears in the formulation of the theorem."

First: M (+) 4 and M (\u2212) 4 have opposite spatial orientations, but the same direction of the arrow of time. Second: M (+)4 and M (\u2212) 4 have the same spatial orientations, but opposite directions of the arrows of time. Since the submanifolds M (+)4 and M (\u2212) 4 are separated by a spacelike hypersurface B, it seems very unnatural (or even impossible ?) to have opposite spatial orientations on both sides of B. But the second interpretation looks much more attractive. Normal vectors to the spacelike hypersurface B are timelike. As an example of such a normal vector, consider \u2202\u00b5\u03d5: if X\u03d5 > 0 in a neighborhood of B, then \u2202\u00b5\u03d5 is a timelike vector. Then the effect of opposite directions of the arrows of time in M (+)4 and M (\u2212) 4 manifests itself in almost opposite directions of the vectors \u2202\u00b5\u03d5 in M (+) 4 and \u2202\u00b5\u03d5\u030c in M (\u2212) 4 . Thus, the appearance of opposite directions of the arrows of time may be a manifestation of the effect of spontaneous violation of the orientability of M4. This geometric interpretation, which is based on the results of the model dynamics, seems to be consistent with a completely different approach based on the idea of opposite directions of thermodynamic arrows of time, proposed in the papers [38]-[41]. Accepting the interpretation that the reason for the opposite space-time orientations in M (+)4 and M (\u2212) 4 is the opposite direction of the arrows of time in M (+) 4 and M (\u2212) 4 , the only addition that we can make is that all processes in M (\u2212)4 proceed in the inverse direction of time. Therefore, the space-like hypersurface \u03a5(x) = 0 is also the boundary for pastdirected time-like geodesics in the submanifold M (\u2212)4 , that is, M (\u2212) 4 is also past-geodesically incomplete."

            "text": "In the framework of TMT in the Palatini formalism, we explored the scalar field model with the potential V (\u03c6) = 12m 2\u03c62 + \u03bb4\u03c6 4 and non-minimal coupling to gravity. The inclusion of the volume 4-form \u03a5d4x (defined by Eq.(1.2)) along with the standard Riemannian 4- form \u221a \u2212gd4x in the principle of least action has far-reaching consequences. Some of them, studied in detail in Secs.3 and 4, look completely unexpected against the background of our experience in field theory with only the Riemannian volume form. Under certain conditions, the possibility of mutual influence of the dynamics of matter fields and the continuous function \u03a5(x) arises, and it can manifest itself as a mutual influence between matter and such a fundamental property of the space-time manifold as orientation. As we have seen, in the model under study this mutual influence turns out to be so significant that the dynamics of the scalar field is capable of causing spontaneous violation of the orientability of the spacetime manifold. For a more accurate understanding of the novelty introduced into the field theory by the volume 4-form \u03a5d4x, it is useful to compare it with the gravitational action of matter (in the model under consideration, this is the scalar field \u03d5(x)). In the simplest model of Sec.2, as seen from the constraint (2.33), \u03b6(x) is a local function of \u03d5(x): \u03b6(x) = \u03b6(\u03d5(x)).\n\u2013 31 \u2013\nConversely, \u03b6(x) also enters the \u03d5 field equation and the energy-momentum tensor as a local function \u03b6(\u03d5(x)). On the contrary, in general relativity the influence of matter on the metric tensor is found as a solution to the Einstein equations, and therefore the metric tensor in the Einstein frame g\u0303\u00b5\u03bd(x) is an integral over the space-time distribution of matter. In the model of Sec.3, this comparison becomes more complicated, since now the constraint (3.4) describes \u03b6(x) as a local function of two variables: \u03b6(x) = \u03b6(\u03d5(x), X\u03d5(x)), where X\u03d5 = 12 g\u0303\n\u03b1\u03b2\u03d5,\u03b1\u03d5,\u03b2 depends on g\u0303\u00b5\u03bd(x), which in a self-consistent problem must be found as a solution to the Einstein equations. Therefore, in the general case, \u03b6(x) can be affected by matter not only locally. However, in this paper, our attention has been focused on what happens near the hypersurface \u03a5 = 0, that is, when \u03a5 \u2261 \u03b6(\u03d5,X\u03d5) \u00b7 \u221a \u2212g \u2192 0+. This happens as \u03d5\u2192 \u03d5 \u22120 and then X\u03d5 \u2192 0+ (see Eq.(4.1)). Therefore, such a strong effect as the spontaneous violation of the orientability of the space-time manifold is in fact a consequence of the local nature of the mutual influence of the dynamics of the scalar field \u03d5(x) and the density \u03a5(x) of the volume measure dV\u03a5 on the spacelike hypersurface \u03a5(x) = 0. Starting with the problem of initial conditions for inflation and assuming that \u03c1(in)kin > \u03c1\n(in) grad, we discovered the existence of a spacelike hypersurface \u03a5(x) = 0. The boundary conditions on the hypersurface \u03a5(x) = 0, which are an unambiguous consequence of the model dynamics, are the cause of the past directed timelike geodesic incompleteness of the inflationary spacetime. This allows us to identify the spacelike hypersurface \u03a5(x) = 0 with the boundary B, the existence of which is predicted by the BGV theorem, Due to the presence of the volume 4-form \u03a5(x)d4x in the principle of least action, a new possibility (or even a logical necessity) opens up for adding one more vacuum-like term \u221d \u03a52\u221a\u2212gV2 to the primordial Lagrangian in addition to the usual \u221d \u221a \u2212gV1. It turns out that this novelty is decisive for achieving most of the results obtained. This is easy to verify: in the limit V2 \u2192 0, almost all physical quantities tend to zero or to infinity Finally, it is worth noting that if we really believe in the efficiency of mathematics, then we have no reason to ignore the possibility of including the 4-form \u03a5d4x as a volume measure in the primordial action. Moreover, this seems quite natural, since the construction of smooth manifolds, and in particular a four-dimensional space-time manifold, begins with equipping the topological space with a differentiable structure. As a result, the volume 4-form appears even before the 4D differentiable manifold is endowed with an affine connection and a metric [70],[71]. In this regard, the main conclusion that follows from this paper is that the scene on which we build our cosmological models can be significantly expanded if we recognize that orientability is not a self-evident property of the space-time manifold."

            "text": "The main idea of TMT is that in the four-dimensional space-time, in addition to the terms included in the primordial action of the theory with the volume element dVg = \u221a \u2212gd4x, there are terms that appear in the primordial action with a metric-independent volume element dV\u03a5 defined by Eq.(1.2). The use of the volume element dV\u03a5 in the action integral along with dVg leads to very intersting results studied in the series of papers (see e.g. [44] - [52]). Here we formulate the main ideas of TMT and describe the algorithm in general terms, listing all the steps to obtain the results of the theory. The primordial action in TMT in the Palatini formalism includes the following set of variables: 4 functions \u03d5a from which \u03a5 is built, affine connection \u0393\u03bb\u00b5\u03bd , primordial (original) metric tensor g\u00b5\u03bd , and matter fields. All these variables\n\u2013 32 \u2013\nare assumed to be independent, and the relationship between them is the result of applying the least action principle. As far as the relationship between connection and metric is concerned, this is reminiscent of Palatini\u2019s formalism, which are well studied in models of the usual theory containing only the volume element dVg. However, the inclusion of one more volume element, dV\u03a5, significantly expands the consequences of the Palatini formalism.\nThe TMT procedure consists of the following steps:\n\u2022 1. Variation with respect to scalar functions \u03d5a (a = 1, .., 4) yields an equation solution of which exists if \u03a5 6= 0 and it contains an integration constant M of dimentionality (mass)4.\n\u2022 2. Variation with respect to the affine connection leads to a differential equation, the solution of which gives the connection coefficients. Besides the original metric and its derivatives, this solution for the connection coefficients may also contain matter fields and their first derivatives. In the context of TMT, when applying the Palatini formalism, a new aspect arises: namely, the differential equation for the connection coefficients and its solution also include the scalar \u03b6(x) and its first derivatives (the scalar \u03b6(x) is defined by Eq.(2.5). Obviously, the connection coefficients thus obtained are non-Riemannian (the covariant derivative of the primordial metric tensor with such connection coefficients is nonzero).\n\u2022 3. Varying the primordial metric results in the equations similar to what occurs in the usual Palatini formalism, but now they also contain the scalar \u03b6(x).\n\u2022 4. The condition for the compatibility of the equations obtained at steps 1 and 3 has the form of an algebraic equation describing the scalar \u03b6(x) as a local function of matter fields; it also contains an arbitrary integration constant M. In Refs.[44]-[51], this equation is called \u2019constraint\u2019, which we also use in this paper.\n\u2022 5. All matter field equations obtained by variation of the primordial action contain the scalar \u03b6(x) and its derivatives.\n\u2022 6. By a Weyl transformation of the primordial metric g\u00b5\u03bd , one can simultaneously ensure that the new metric g\u0303\u00b5\u03bd is Riemannian, and the connection coefficients found in step 2 are converted into the Christoffel coefficients of g\u0303\u00b5\u03bd . As a result, the equations obtained in step 3 take exactly the form of Einstein\u2019s equations with the same Newton constant. Therefore g\u0303\u00b5\u03bd is the metric in the Einstein frame. The energy-momentum tensor arising in the Einstein frame, which we call \u2019the TMT effective energy-momentum tensor\u2019, contains the scalar \u03b6(x), which, in turn, due to the constraint mentioned in step 4, is expressed in terms of matter fields. The potential of scalar field entering to the TMT effective energy-momentum tensor will be called \u2019the TMT effective potential\u2019. A similar thing happens in the matter field equations. This feature of TMT is a source of very interesting and fundamentally new effects, which will also be demonstrated in this paper.\n\u2022 7. The sequential execution of the steps described above will be referred to as the \"TMT procedure\". Finally, to check if the TMT procedure was performed correctly, as well as for the convenience of working with the obtained equations in the Einstein frame, one can construct an action whose variation leads to these equations. For this action, we will use the term \u2019TMT effective action\u2019. The terms \u2019TMT effective energy-momentum\n\u2013 33 \u2013\ntensor\u2019, \u2019TMT effective potential\u2019 and \u2019TMT effective action\u2019 are introduced in order not to confuse them with similar terms used when quantum corrections are taken into account.\nIn order to avoid misunderstanding and confusion regarding the methods of obtaining model results, it seems necessary to state the difference between TMT models and \"conventional\" alternative theories of gravity (that is, models with only one standard Riemannian volume measure). This difference consists only in the order of operations: in the conventional alternative models, the transition to the Einstein frame in the original action is first performed, after which, by varying the resulting action, equations are obtained; in TMT models, first, equations are obtained by varying the original (primordial) action, and then a transition to the Einstein frame is performed in these equations. We also note that if the procedure used in conventional alternative gravity theories were carried out in TMT, then this would lead to the disappearance of \u03a5 in the volume measure, at least in part of the terms, and its appearance in the Lagrangian, which would lead to completely different theory."

            "heading": "B Analysis of the condition \u03b6 > 0 in the model of Sec.3",
            "text": "B.1 Constraint on the maximum initial value of X\u03d5 > 0 in a model with bk 6= 1 and bp 6= 1\nThe results obtained in this Appendix follow from a detailed study of the inequality (3.16). It follows from the discussion in Sec.3.2 that the sign of initial X\u03d5, X (in) \u03d5 , can significantly affect the results. X(in)\u03d5 can be positive or negative depending on how inhomogeneous and anisotropic at the beginning of inflation was the space domain whose expansion generates our Universe. In this subsection, the analysis is carried out under the assumption that X(in)\u03d5 > 0. In the next subsection, an analysis is made for the case X(in)\u03d5 < 0. To fulfill the requirement \u03b6 > 0 for X\u03d5 \u2265 0, the values of \u03d5 and X\u03d5 must satisfy the inequality\n2|V2|\u03b6v(1+\u03b6v)\u2212 (2bp\u22121) [ m2M2P\n2\u03be sinh2 z +\n\u03bb\n4\u03be2 M4P sinh 4 z\n] \u2212 (1\u2212bk) cosh4 z \u00b7X\u03d5 > 0 (B.1)\nwhich follows from the inequality (3.16). In particular, the inequality must be true for initial values \u03d5in and X (in) \u03d5 . Given that we are interested in the range zin = \u221a \u03be \u03d5inMP 1, the inequality can be represented as the following upper constraint on X(in)\u03d5 which depends on \u03d5in\n0 \u2264 X (in) \u03d5\nM4P <\n1\n1\u2212 bk\n[ 32q4\u03b6v(1 + \u03b6v)e \u22124 \u221a \u03be \u03d5in MP \u2212 4(2bp \u2212 1) \u03bb\n4\u03be2\n] (B.2)\nIt is convenient to describe the position of \u03d5in relative to \u03d50 defined by Eq.(3.15). Since\u221a \u03be \u03d50MP 1, Eq.(3.15) reduces to\n32q4\u03b6v(1 + \u03b6v) = (2bp \u2212 1) \u03bb\n4\u03be2 e\n4 \u221a \u03be \u03d50 MP . (B.3)\nInserting (B.3) to Eq.(B.2) we obtain\n0 \u2264 X(in)\u03d5 < \u03bb(2bp \u2212 1) 4\u03be2(1\u2212 bk) M4P\n[ exp ( 4 \u221a \u03be ( \u03d50 MP \u2212 \u03d5in MP )) \u2212 1 ] def = X\u0302(\u03d5in), (B.4)\n\u2013 34 \u2013\nwhere X\u0302(\u03d5in) describes the limiting upper bound of admissible values of X (in) \u03d5 \u2265 0 as a function of \u03d5in. More precisely, here the term \"limiting upper bound of admissible values of X(in)\u03d5 \u2265 0\" means that \u03b6 > 0 for any X(in)\u03d5 satisfying 0 \u2264 X(in)\u03d5 < X\u0302(\u03d5in) and \u03b6 < 0 for any X(in)\u03d5 > X\u0302(\u03d5in). Note that X\u0302(\u03d5in) > 0 if \u03d5in < \u03d50. We see that:\n1) When \u03d5in \u2192 \u03d5 \u22120 we get that X\u0302(\u03d5in) and hence X (in) \u03d5 and \u03b6 = \u03b6(\u03d5(in), X (in) \u03d5 ) tend\nto zero while remaining positive\nlim \u03d5\u2192\u03d5 \u22120 X\u0302(\u03d5in) = lim \u03d5\u2192\u03d5 \u22120 X(in)\u03d5 = 0 and lim \u03d5\u2192\u03d5 \u22120 \u03b6(\u03d5in, X (in) \u03d5 ) = 0, (B.5)\nwhich will be especially important in Sec.4, where we study what happens near the hypersurface \u03a5(x) = 0. 2) Just as it was in the model of Sec.2, where \u03b6 does not depend on X(\u03d5), the condition \u03b6 > 0 forbids \u03d5in to be \u03d5in \u2265 \u03d50. It is important to recall that we come to this conclusion under the condition X(in)\u03d5 > 0. In the case of X (in) \u03d5 < 0 this statement is false (see subsection B.2 of this Appendix). 3) X\u0302(\u03d5in) increases monotonically as \u03d5in decreases. This means that by shifting \u03d5in in a decreasing direction, one can reach a state \u03d5(min)in , where X\u0302(\u03d5in) becomes equal to V (0) eff (\u03d5in), and for \u03d5in < \u03d5 (min) in we get X\u0302(\u03d5in) > V (0) eff (\u03d5in). Thus, in the interval \u03d5 (min) in < \u03d5in < \u03d50 the condition X(in)\u03d5 < V (0) eff (\u03d5in) is satisfied automatically. The value of \u03d5 (min) in can be estimated by the approximate equality\nX\u0302(\u03d5in)|max = X\u0302(\u03d5in)|\u03d5in=\u03d5(min)in = \u03bb(2bp \u2212 1) 4\u03be2(1\u2212 bk) M4P\n[ exp ( 4 \u221a \u03be ( \u03d50 MP \u2212 \u03d5 (min) in MP )) \u2212 1 ]\n\u2248 V (0)eff (\u03d5 (min) in ) \u2248\nk1\u03bb(\u03b6v + bp) 4\u03be2(1 + \u03b6v)2 M4P , (B.6)\nwhere the dimensionless factor k1 \u2265 1 is introduced in order to take into account the change in the height of the potential when \u03d5in changes on the segment where the first plateau passes into the second plateau. In the case presented in Fig.3, we see that 1 \u2264 k1 . 1.1, whereas for the shape of V (0)eff (\u03d5) in Fig.4 we can take 1 \u2264 k1 . 1.03. Since we are interested in the very existence of the interval of \u03d5in, in which the conditions for inflation are being prepared, we can restrict ourselves to a qualitative account of this minor change. Thus, it follows from Eqs.(B.4)-(B.6) that if X(in)\u03d5 \u2265 0 and the initial value \u03d5in of the canonically normalized classical inflaton field is in the interval\n\u03d5 (min) in \u2264 \u03d5in < \u03d50, where \u03d5 (min) in = \u03d50 \u2212 MP 4 \u221a \u03be ln\n( 1 +\nk1(1\u2212 bk)(\u03b6v + bp) (2bp \u2212 1)(1 + \u03b6v)2\n) , (B.7)\nthen both the condition \u03b6 > 0 and the condition X(\u03d5in) < V (0) eff (\u03d5in) required for the onset of inflation are guaranteed. Although for \u03d5in < \u03d5 (min) in , as we found out, X\u0302(\u03d5in) > V (0) eff (\u03d5in) , the value of X (in) \u03d5 may still satisfy the condition X(in)\u03d5 < V (0) eff (\u03d5in) required for the onset of inflation. And if X(in)\u03d5 < X\u0302(\u03d5in), then \u03b6 remains positive. Therefore, the conditions necessary for the beginning of inflation are also possible for \u03d5in < \u03d5 (min) in , but their fulfillment in this interval is not guaranteed.\n\u2013 35 \u2013\nB.2 Constraints on the initial values of |X\u03d5| in a model with bk 6= 1 and bp 6= 1 if X\u03d5 < 0\nIf X(in)\u03d5 < 0, i.e. the initial gradient energy density is larger than the initial kinetic energy density, then it is useful to rewrite the constraint (3.9) in the form\n\u03b6 = \u03b6(\u03d5in, X (in) \u03d5 ) =\n32q4\u03b6v(1 + \u03b6v)\u2212 (2bp \u2212 1) \u03bb4\u03be2 e 4zin + (1\u2212 bk) |X(in)\u03d5 | M4P e4zin\n32q4(1 + \u03b6v) + \u03bb 4\u03be2 e4zin \u2212 (1\u2212 bk) |X(in)\u03d5 | M4P\ne4zin , (B.8)\nwhere zin = \u221a \u03be \u03d5inMP 1 and, as before, the negligible terms \u221d e\n2zin are omitted. Again, as in the previous subsection, it is convenient to describe the position of \u03d5in relative to \u03d50 defined by Eq.(3.15). Then it follows from Eq.(B.8) that the condition \u03b6 > 0 is sutisfied if\n\u03b6 = (2bp \u2212 1) \u03bb4\u03be2\n( e4(z0\u2212zin) \u2212 1 ) + (1\u2212 bk)\n|X(in)\u03d5 | M4P\n\u03bb 4\u03be2 ( 2bp\u22121 \u03b6v e4(z0\u2212zin) + 1 ) \u2212 (1\u2212 bk) |X(in)\u03d5 | M4P \u2261 N D > 0, where z0 =\n\u221a \u03be \u03d50 MP (B.9)\nIt turns out that the analysis of restrictions on \u03d5in that ensure both \u03b6 > 0 and the condition |X(in)\u03d5 | . V (0)eff (\u03d5in) should be carried out separately for the cases \u03d5in < \u03d50 and \u03d5in > \u03d50. Note that in the case X\u03d5 < 0 the condition |X(in)\u03d5 | . V (0)eff (\u03d5in) implies the fulfillment of the conditions (3.1) nesessery for the onset of inflation.\nB.2.1 The case of the interval \u03d5in < \u03d50\nObviously, in this case the numerator N in (B.9) is positive. The denominator D> 0 if\n|X(in)\u03d5 | < \u03bb\n4\u03be2(1\u2212 bk) M4P [ 2bp \u2212 1 \u03b6v exp ( 4 \u221a \u03be ( \u03d50 MP \u2212 \u03d5in MP )) + 1 ] def = \u0302|X(\u03d5in)|. (B.10)\nwhere \u0302|X(\u03d5in)| describes the limiting upper bound of admissible values of |X(in)\u03d5 | as a function of \u03d5in. Trying to repeat the analysis similar to that which was made after Eq.(B.4), we also notice that \u0302|X(\u03d5in)| decreases monotonically as \u03d5in increases. But unlike the case when X\u03d5 > 0, now limit of \u0302|X(\u03d5in)| as \u03d5in \u2192 \u03d5 \u22120 is non-zero in general:\nlim \u03d5\u2192\u03d5 \u22120\n\u0302|X(\u03d5in)| = \u03bb\n4\u03be2(1\u2212 bk) ( 2bp \u2212 1 \u03b6v + 1 ) M4P (B.11)\nIn the case of the parameters used in Fig.3, this limit is equal to 2 \u00b7 10\u221210M4P , and for the parametrs used in Fig.4 this limit is \u2248 4.5 \u00b710\u221210M4P . Despite the significant difference in the shape of the effective TMT potential in these two examples, we find that the minimum value of \u0302|X(\u03d5in)| exceeds the height of the potential plateau given by Planck\u2019s data. By numerical verification in a wide range of model parameters, we failed to find the possibility that \u0302|X(\u03d5in)| does not exceed 10\u221210M4P in a significant way. This allows us to conclude that in the case of X\u03d5 < 0, most likely, the initial conditions necessary for the beginning of inflation cannot arise in the interval \u03d5in < \u03d50.\n\u2013 36 \u2013\nB.2.2 The case of the interval \u03d5in > \u03d50 In this case, to ensure \u03b6 > 0, we have to consider two options: (A) N > 0, D > 0; (B) N < 0, D < 0. Let us start from the option (B). From Eq.(B.9), as a result of combyning the conditions N < 0 and D < 0, we get a double inequality\n\u03bb\n4\u03be2\n( 1 +\n2bp \u2212 1 \u03b6v\ne\u22124(zin\u2212z0) ) <\n1\u2212 bk M4P |X(in)\u03d5 | < (2bp \u2212 1) \u03bb 4\u03be2\n( 1\u2212 e\u22124(zin\u2212z0) ) , (B.12)\nwhich implies that\n(2bp \u2212 1) ( 1\n\u03b6v + 1\n) e\u22124(zin\u2212z0) < 2(bp \u2212 1). (B.13)\nBut for any 0.5 < bp < 1 the latter is impossible, which means that in the case of option (B) \u03b6 cannot be positive.\nNow let us consider the option (A). For \u03d5in > \u03d50 the numerator N in the inequality (B.9) is positive if\n(1\u2212 bk) |X(in)\u03d5 | M4P > (2bp \u2212 1) \u03bb 4\u03be2\n( 1\u2212 e\u22124(zin\u2212z0) ) . (B.14)\nwheares the denominator D is positive if\n(1\u2212 bk) |X(in)\u03d5 | M4P < \u03bb 4\u03be2 ( 2bp \u2212 1 \u03b6v e\u22124(zin\u2212z0) + 1 ) . (B.15)\nCombining (B.14) and (B.15) we get that \u03b6 > 0 for any \u03d5in > \u03d50 if\n(2bp \u2212 1) ( 1\n\u03b6v + 1\n) e\u22124(zin\u2212z0) + 2(1\u2212 bp) > 0 (B.16)\nand if X(in)\u03d5 < 0 satisfies the inequality (B.14). Note that the inequality (B.16) is satisfied by our choice of 0.5 < bp < 1. Thus, contrary to what we learned earlier, i.e. when X (in) \u03d5 > 0, if the gradient energy density prevails over the kinetic energy density, then the range \u03d5in > \u03d50 may not be an artifact and this becomes possible due to X(in)\u03d5 < 0. However, inflationary expansion in this range of initial values \u03d5in and X (in) \u03d5 can only start if the upper bound on |X(in)\u03d5 | satisfies inequality\n|X(in)\u03d5 | . V (0) eff (\u03d5in) \u2248\nk2\u03bb(\u03b6v + bp) 4\u03be2(1 + \u03b6v)2 M4P , (B.17)\nwhich is an additional requirement here, in contrast to what was in the case X(in)\u03d5 > 0 considered in Appendix B.1. Here the factor 1 < k2 . 1.3 is introduced because taking into account the shape of the TMT effective potential V (0)eff (\u03d5) in the case shown in Fig.3, we see that for \u03d5in > \u03d50 the scenario is not ruled out when inflation occurs in two stages: first through a higher plateau, and then through a lower plateau. Interestingly, in the case shown in Fig.4, \u03d50 is the value that already corresponds to the second plateau (note that, compared to Fig.3, the presence of the second plateau in Fig. 4 is much less obvious) .\n\u2013 37 \u2013\nCombyning (B.14) and (B.15) and using (B.17) we get the following double inequality\n(2bp \u2212 1)(1 + \u03b6v)2\nk2(1\u2212 bk)(\u03b6v + bp)\n( 1\u2212 e\u22124(zin\u2212z0) ) < |X(in)\u03d5 | V\n(0) eff (\u03d5in)\n< (1 + \u03b6v)\n2\nk2(\u03b6v + bp) ( 2bp \u2212 1 \u03b6v e\u22124(zin\u2212z0) + 1 ) ,\n(B.18) which describes the condition \u03b6 > 0 together with the additional requirement (B.17) needed for the onset of inflation. Consider separately two examples shown in Fig.3 and Fig.4. In the case of the model parameters used in Fig.3, if k2 = 1.3 is used, (B.18) takes the form\n1.64 ( 1\u2212 e\u22124(zin\u2212z0) ) < |X(in)\u03d5 | V\n(0) eff (\u03d5in)\n< 1.23 ( 2e\u22124(zin\u2212z0) + 1 ) , (B.19)\nFrom this double inequality follows the conclusion: if X(in)\u03d5 < 0, then with the model parameters used in Fig.3, for almost all \u03d5in > \u03d50 (with the exception of \u03d5in > \u03d50 which are very close to \u03d50) the initial condition (B.17) needed for the beginning of inflation is incompatible with the condition \u03b6 > 0.\nWith the model parameters used in Fig.4, (B.18) takes the form\n8 \u00b7 10\u22126 \u00b7 ( 1\u2212 e\u22124(zin\u2212z0) ) < |X(in)\u03d5 | V\n(0) eff (\u03d5in)\n< 2 ( 10\u22125\u00b7e\u22124(zin\u2212z0) + 1 ) , (B.20)\nfrom which we conclude that if X(in)\u03d5 < 0, then for any \u03d5in > \u03d50 the joint fulfillment of the condition \u03b6 > 0 and the initial condition (B.17) necessary for the beginning of inflation is possible. Moreover, since the right side of the inequality (B.20) is only 2 times greater than the value necessary as a condition for the onset of inflation, we come to the conclusion that almost in the entire range of restrictions on the values of X(in)\u03d5 imposed by the condition \u03b6 > 0, in the infinite interval \u03d5in > \u03d50, the condition (B.17) necessary for the beginning of inflation is guaranteed."

            "text": "The effect of quantum corrections to the model under study and the related possible deviations from the plateau-like form of the TMT effective potential are of particular interest. An analysis of possible approaches to solving the problem of calculating quantum corrections in the TMT models shows that TMT dictates the need to perform calculations based on the following algorithm. 1) Quantum corrections must be calculated not with the use of the TMT effective action, but with the primordial action. Indeed, for example, the TMT effective potential includes a contribution from the scalar \u03b6, the value of which is determined from the constraint in the zeroth approximation. Calculating the quantum effective potential in the usual way using the TMT effective potential as the zeroth approximation, we still take into account \u03b6 in the zeroth approximation. Thus, we ignore the quantum corrections to the constraint, and hence to the \u03b6. Compare this with the approach in which we start by calculating the quantum corrections to the primordial action. Then, proceeding, for example, from the effective primordial action calculated in the one-loop approximation, following the standard TMT procedure, we can obtain both the constraint and the effective TMT action, in which one-loop corrections are taken into account.\n\u2013 38 \u2013\n2) To calculate the quantum corrections to the primordial action (3.2), one can apply the standard technique for calculating the effective potential in the background gravitational field. But in TMT this stage is complicated by the presence of the volume measure \u03a5d4x in the primordial action. By redefining some parameters and variables, the contribution of \u03a5 = \u03b6 \u221a \u2212g can be absorbed so that the primordial action is reduced to the standard form which is considered as the action for a scalar field in the background gravitational field. When making the above redifinitions, we must treat the scalar \u03b6 as another constant background field. 3) After finding the one-loop effective action for a scalar field in the background gravitational field using the standard technique, we must return to the original parameters and variables using inverse redefinitions. As a result, we obtain the TMT action in the one-loop approximation, in which again there are terms with the standard volume measure \u221a \u2212gd4x and with the volume measure \u03a5d4x. To this action, we can apply the TMT procedure, which, as usual in TMT, will contain variations in all variables, including the metric tensor and the scalars \u03d5a from which \u03a5 is built. The calculation of quantum corrections and the study of possible cosmological effects caused by these corrections to the constraint and the plateau-like potential will be considered elsewhere. But the preliminary estimates made in one-loop approximation show that their effect on the plateau-like shape of the potential is apparently negligible."
