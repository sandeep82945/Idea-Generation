 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the findings in this paper:

1. Further investigate the enzymatic production of (9'Z)-lutein in Anthemis tinctoria and Helichrysum italicum flowers. Isolate and characterize the enzyme(s) involved. 

2. Explore the bioavailability and biological activities (antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, etc.) of the various lutein cis-isomers found in the flowers. Compare to trans-lutein. 

3. Identify additional natural sources of zeaxanthin-free lutein besides the 4 flowers mentioned. Assess if absence of zeaxanthin affects lutein absorption or activity.

4. Conduct breeding or genetic engineering studies to increase production of specific lutein isomers in the flowers. This could allow for sustainable commercial production.

5. Examine the carotenoid biosynthetic pathways in the studied flowers in more detail. Look for evidence of novel enzymes or regulatory mechanisms affecting isomer production.
