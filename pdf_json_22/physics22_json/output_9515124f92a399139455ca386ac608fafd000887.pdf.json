We demonstrate the Hamiltonian analysis of f(Q) gravity with fixing the coincident gauge condition. Using the standard Dirac-Bergmann algorithm, we show that f(Q) gravity has 8 physical degrees of freedom. This result reflects that the diffeomorphism symmetry of f(Q) gravity is completely broken due to the gauge fixing. Moreover, in terms of the perturbations, we discuss the possible mode decomposition of these degrees of freedom.",

We demonstrate the Hamiltonian analysis of f(Q) gravity with fixing the coincident gauge condition. Using the standard Dirac-Bergmann algorithm, we show that f(Q) gravity has 8 physical degrees of freedom. This result reflects that the diffeomorphism symmetry of f(Q) gravity is completely broken due to the gauge fixing. Moreover, in terms of the perturbations, we discuss the possible mode decomposition of these degrees of freedom.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nGeneral relativity (GR) is a well-known classical theory for describing gravity, where Einstein starts with a few convincing physical assumptions; for instance, GR depicts gravity as a geometric theory of space-time, which is curved by any form of energy. For a given distribution of matter, the structure of space-time is determined by the Einstein field equations [1, 2]. However, we face a troublesome problem: There is more than one way to describe gravity equivalent to GR. GR can be represented in three equivalent representations which are equivalent to each other at their background level, up to a total derivative (boundary term) linear in the Lagrangian: the curvature representation for ordinary GR, which geometrically describes the variation of the orientation of a vector in the parallel transport; the teleparallel representation for the teleparallel equivalent to general relativity (TEGR), where the location of a vector will change in the parallel transport [3, 4]; the nonmetricity representation for the symmetric teleparallel equivalent to general relativity (STEGR), where the length of a vector will change in the parallel transport [5\u20137]. Moreover, we already know the shortcomings of the above theories; they cannot adequately describe the late-time accelerated expansion of the Universe. The situation became more desperate with the improvement of the accuracy of observations [8\u201310]. In order to solve this problem, we have to introduce the concept of dark energy (DE). In the framework of the above three basic theories, dark energy manifests itself in the form of exotic matter with negative pressure, implying that it violates the strong energy condition. Although the cosmological constant provides the simplest way to account for DE, it also causes notorious problems, such as fine-tuning and coincidence problems. Another way to avoid such issues is to modify the gravitational theories. Straightforward modifications of the Lagrangian of GR, TEGR, and STEGR give us f(R), f(T ), and f(Q) gravity, respectively. These have infinite possibilities due to the arbitrary Lagrangian function, which could provide us with solutions to the DE problem. This work sheds light on f(Q) gravity [11]. One notable advantage of ordinary GR is that the field equations of f(Q) gravity remain second order of the derivative, regardless of the Lagrangian function. Furthermore, it is also notable that f(Q) gravity is not equivalent to f(R) gravity. This inequality stems from the total derivative term, which no longer remains linear, and thus the boundary term cannot be dropped by the integral [12]. These two properties of f(Q) gravity are the same as those of f(T ) gravity, and one expects different outcomes in f(Q) gravity from those in f(R) or f(T ) gravity even for the same function form. Recently, f(Q) gravity has been intensively investigated. As it applies to cosmology and astrophysics, for instance, cosmological perturbations [12\u201314], cosmography applications [15, 16], spherically symmetric solutions [17, 18], and gravitational waves [19, 20] have been studied. For the development of the theory itself, the covariant formulation of f(Q) gravity has been investigated in [18, 21, 22]. Moreover, the construction of a conformal invariant theory [23] and a generalization to the so-called general teleparallel quadratic tensor theories [24] and its Hamiltonian analysis have been proposed [25]. To perform a canonical quantization procedure for f(Q) cosmology, a Hamiltonian formulation has been established in the cosmology background (nonperturbation level) [26]. Despite extensive research on f(Q) gravity, many aspects of this theory have not yet been studied; for example, it has not been thoroughly investigated how many degrees of freedom (d.o.f.) it possesses. This issue is essential because it will not only have a direct effect on its cosmological perturbation theory but it will reveal the implicit symmetry in f(Q) gravity that we might not have noticed before. The above is the primary purpose of this paper.\n\u2217Electronic address: hukun@mails.ccnu.edu.cn \u2020Electronic address: taishi@mail.ccnu.edu.cn (co-corresponding author) \u2021Electronic address: qiutt@hust.edu.cn (corresponding author)\n2 To find out the number of d.o.f. in f(Q) gravity, the best way is to apply the Hamiltonian formulation [27, 28]. Following Dirac\u2019s procedure [29, 30], one can analyze the constraint structure strictly and obtain the independent dynamical variables straight from the Lagrange or field equations. The above is the approach we take in this paper. For the sake of simplicity, we concentrate on the framework of the coincident gauge (CG), in which the inertial connection can be trivialized by diffeomorphism (diff.); hence there is no curvature or inertial concept in coincident general relativity (CGR). Regarding physical d.o.f., we know that TEGR and CGR have 2 d.o.f due to their equivalence of GR [31\u201334]. On the other hand, the f(T ) gravity has 5 d.o.f, and the extra 3 comes from the violation of local Lorentz invariance [35\u201337]. Moreover, in the coincident gauge, the general covariance is broken, which will affect the d.o.f. in general. Therefore, physical d.o.f. in f(Q) gravity are highly nontrivial and totally different from those in the f(R) or f(T ) gravity theories studied before. As was briefly argued, this work potentially contributes to the mode decomposition of the cosmological perturbations as well as gravitational waves in f(Q) gravity. Although the existing works have shown features of f(Q) gravity with specific models assumed, the Hamiltonian analysis can clarify the structure of the f(Q) gravity in a model-independent way. From theoretical viewpoints, the analysis of propagating modes can provide us with a guideline for calculations; that is, how many perturbations we take into account and what kind of perturbations we consider when we go beyond the background-level analysis. Moreover, from phenomenological viewpoints, the perturbation or polarization unique to f(Q) gravity are probes to distinguish f(Q) gravity from other modified gravity theories. For instance, a comparison of the f(R) and f(T ) gravity theories is helpful to reveal the specific feature of f(Q) gravity. The f(R) and f(T ) gravity theories have been investigated for several decades, and we can utilize the known results in these two theories as references for studying f(Q) gravity. The present paper is organized as follows: The geometric background, the gravitational action, and a brief review of the Hamiltonian formulation of CGR are presented in Sec. II. We investigate Arnowitt-Deser-Misner (ADM) foliation of f(Q) gravity in Sec. III. In Sec. IV we apply standard Hamiltonian analysis to f(Q) gravity. In Secs. V and Secs. VI, we count the d.o.f. in f(Q) gravity and give a brief discussion about the physical meaning of our conclusion. For clarity of notation, we adopt the conventional symbol for the indices in this paper. The latin indices (i, j, k, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) running from 1 to 3 represent the spatial indices, and greek indices (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ) running from 0 to 3 represent the space-time indices. We define some special symbols in Table I.\nIn this section, we briefly review the underlying geometrical background that will be used throughout this work in Sec IIA. Then, in order to recall the standard Dirac\u2019s procedure for constrained systems in field theory, we also review Hamiltonian formulation and encapsulate the main conclusion of [34] in II B, which has performed a rigorous Hamiltonian analysis of CGR.\n3 A. Geometrical foundations\nTo start with, we extend the Riemannian geometry by treating the metric and connection as two independent variables. Moreover, the connection is not necessarily symmetric or compatible, which means that besides the curvature, torsion and nonmetricity can also be nonvanishing in the manifold. This implies that the decomposition of a general affine connection can be written as\n\u0393\u0302\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd = { \u03b1 \u00b5\u03bd } +K\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd + L \u03b1 \u00b5\u03bd , (1)\nwhere {\n\u03b1 \u00b5\u03bd\n} is Levi-Civita connection which can be uniquely determined by the first-order derivatives of the metric\n{ \u03b1 \u00b5\u03bd } = 1\n2 g\u03b1\u03bb (g\u03bb\u03bd,\u00b5 + g\u00b5\u03bb,\u03bd \u2212 g\u00b5\u03bd,\u03bb) . (2)\nMoreover, K\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd and L \u03b1 \u00b5\u03bd are the contortion tensor and deformation tensor respectively, both describing nonRiemannian properties in the manifold\nK\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd = 1\n2 g\u03b1\u03bb (T\u03bb\u00b5\u03bd + T\u00b5\u03bd\u03bb \u2212 T\u03bd\u03bb\u00b5) , (3)\nL\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd =\u2212 1\n2 g\u03b1\u03bb (Q\u00b5\u03bb\u03bd +Q\u03bd\u03bb\u00b5 \u2212Q\u03bb\u00b5\u03bd) , (4)\nwhere we define the torsion tensor T \u00b5\u03b1\u03b2 and the nonmetricity tensor Q\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd as\nT \u00b5\u03b1\u03b2 \u2261 1\n2 (\u0393\u0302\u00b5\u03b1\u03b2 \u2212 \u0393\u0302 \u00b5 \u03b2\u03b1) ,\nQ\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd \u2261 \u2207\u0302\u03b1g\u00b5\u03bd = \u2202g\u00b5\u03bd \u2202x\u03b1 \u2212 g\u03bd\u03c3\u0393\u0302 \u03c3\u00b5\u03b1 \u2212 g\u03c3\u00b5\u0393\u0302 \u03c3\u03bd\u03b1 . (5)\nNote that the indexes are raised and lowered by the metric, for example\nQ\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd = g \u03b1\u03b2Q\u03b2\u00b5\u03bd = g \u03b1\u03b2\u2207\u0302\u03b2g\u00b5\u03bd = \u2207\u0302\u03b1g\u00b5\u03bd . (6)\nHere and after, we impose the condition that the connection is symmetric, so that the torsion tensor T\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd and the contortion tensor K\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd = 0 vanish, and Eq. (1) turns into\n\u0393\u0302\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd = { \u03b1 \u00b5\u03bd } + L\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd , (7)\nso we can rewrite the Riemann curvature tensor in terms of the general connection\nR\u0302\u03b1\u03b2\u00b5\u03bd(\u0393\u0302 ) = \u2202\u00b5\u0393\u0302 \u03b1 \u03bd\u03b2 \u2212 \u2202\u03bd \u0393\u0302\u03b1\u00b5\u03b2 + \u0393\u0302\u03b1\u00b5\u03bb\u0393\u0302 \u03bb\u03bd\u03b2 \u2212 \u0393\u0302\u03b1\u03bd\u03bb\u0393\u0302 \u03bb\u00b5\u03b2\n= R\u03b1\u03b2\u00b5\u03bd + (\u2202\u00b5L\u03b1\u03bd\u03b2 \u2212 \u2202\u03bdL\u03b1\u00b5\u03b2 + L\u03b1\u00b5\u03bbL\u03bb\u03bd\u03b2 \u2212 L\u03b1\u03bd\u03bbL\u03bb\u00b5\u03b2) + {\n\u03b1 \u00b5\u03bb } L\u03bb\u03bd\u03b2 + { \u03bb \u03bd\u03b2 } L\u03b1\u00b5\u03bb \u2212 { \u03bb \u00b5\u03b2 } L\u03b1\u03bd\u03bb \u2212 {\u03b1\u03bd\u03bb}L\u03bb\u00b5\u03b2 + ({ \u03bb \u03bd\u00b5 } L\u03b1\u03bb\u03b2 \u2212 { \u03bb \u00b5\u03bd } L\u03b1\u03bb\u03b2 )\n= R\u03b1\u03b2\u00b5\u03bd + (\u2207\u00b5L\u03b1\u03bd\u03b2 \u2212\u2207\u03bdL\u03b1\u00b5\u03b2 + L\u03b1\u00b5\u03bbL\u03bb\u03bd\u03b2 \u2212 L\u03b1\u03bd\u03bbL\u03bb\u00b5\u03b2) ,\n(8)\nwhere R\u03b1\u03b2\u00b5\u03bd is the usual Riemann tensor in GR composed by the Levi-Civita connection\nR\u03b1\u03b2\u00b5\u03bd({ }) = \u2202\u00b5 { \u03b1 \u03bd\u03b2 } \u2212 \u2202\u03bd { \u03b1 \u00b5\u03b2 } + { \u03b1 \u00b5\u03bb }{ \u03bb \u03bd\u03b2 } \u2212 {\u03b1\u03bd\u03bb} { \u03bb \u00b5\u03b2 } . (9)\nMoreover, the contraction form of (8) is\nR\u0302 = R+ (L\u00b5\u00b5\u03bbL\u03bb \u03bd\u03bd \u2212 L \u00b5 \u03bd\u03bbL \u03bb \u03bd \u00b5 ) +\u2207\u00b5L\u00b5 \u03bd\u03bd \u2212\u2207\u03bdL\u00b5 \u03bd\u00b5 , (10)\nnoticing that last two terms are total derivative terms which can be eliminated after the integral. For the sake of generality, here we will investigate the action of coincident gauge gravity [11]. We start from action of the general quadratic theory 1 [6, 38]\nSGQ = \u222b d4x (\u221a\u2212gQ\u03b1\u00b5\u03bdP\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd + \u03bb\u03b1\u03b2\u00b5\u03bdR\u0302\u03b1\u03b2\u00b5\u03bd + \u03bba\u00b5\u03bdT\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd ) . (11)\n1 For simplicity, we have ignored the 1/(16\u03c0G) in the front of the action, which will not affect our final results.\n4 The last two terms represent the Lagrange multipliers to impose the symmetric teleparallelism condition R\u0302\u03b1\u03b2\u00b5\u03bd = T\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd = 0. We define the first term Q = Q\u03b1\u00b5\u03bdP \u03b1\u00b5\u03bd as the nonmetricity scalar, where P\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd is called the superpotential. Defining the trace of the nonmetricity tensor Q\u03b1 \u2261 Q\u03b1\u00b5\u00b5 and Q\u0303\u03b1 \u2261 Q\u00b5\u03b1\u00b5, P\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd is written as\nP\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd = c1Q \u03b1\u00b5\u03bd + c2Q \u00b5\u03b1\u03bd + c3Q \u03b1g\u00b5\u03bd + c4g \u03b1\u00b5Q\u0303\u03bd + c5 2 (Q\u0303\u03b1g\u00b5\u03bd + g\u03b1\u03bdQ\u00b5) . (12)\nThe symmetric teleparallelism condition restricts the general connection to be total inertia; thus in an arbitrary coordinate system x\u03b1, the connection should be [11]\n\u0393\u0302\u03b1\u00b5\u03b2 = \u2202x\u03b1 \u2202\u03be\u03bb \u22022\u03be\u03bb \u2202x\u00b5\u2202x\u03b2 . (13)\nOne can verify this point by substituting (13) into (8). We can always choose a coordinate x\u03b1 = \u03be\u03bb by utilizing general coordinate transformation, where the general affine connection \u0393\u0302\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd = 0. This spacial frame is also known as coincident gauge. Under such consideration, the Palatini formalism turns into metric formalism, while the metric becomes the only variable. Equation (7) gives\nL\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd = \u2212 { \u03b1 \u00b5\u03bd } = \u22121\n2 g\u03b1\u03bb (g\u03bb\u03bd,\u00b5 + g\u00b5\u03bb,\u03bd \u2212 g\u00b5\u03bd,\u03bb) . (14)\nAs we will show below, under this gauge, in order to meet the requirement that action (11) is equivalent to that of GR, one needs to choose the coefficients in the superpotential P\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd as c1 = \u22121/4, c2 = 1/2, c3 = 1/4, c4 = 0, c5 = \u22121/2, therefore the action (11) turns out to be\nSCGR = 1\n4\n\u222b\nd4x \u221a\u2212g ( \u2212Q\u03b1\u03bd\u03c1Q\u03b1\u03bd\u03c1 + 2Q\u03b1\u03bd\u03c1Q\u03c1\u03b1\u03bd \u2212 2Q\u03c1Q\u0303\u03c1 +Q\u03c1Q\u03c1 ) . (15)\nAs is well known, the Hilbert-Einstein action is\nSEH = \u222b d4x \u221a\u2212gR({}) , (16)\nwhere R({}) is obtained by contracting the Riemann tensor in (9). On the other hand, in standard GR, the second derivatives of the metric in the Ricci scalar can be eliminated by an integration by parts or by adding a suitable boundary or total derivative term, but at the expense of general covariance. Dropping the total derivative, one finds the gravitational action (16) can be reformulated in a form 2 as [39, 40]\nSEH = \u222b d4x \u221a\u2212gg\u00b5\u03bd ({ \u03b1 \u03c3\u00b5 } {\u03c3\u03bd\u03b1} \u2212 {\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1} { \u03c3 \u00b5\u03bd }) + \u222b d4x\u2202\u03b1 (\u221a\u2212g \u03c9\u03b1 ) , (17)\nin which \u03c9\u03b1 = g\u00b5\u03bd\u0393\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd \u2212 g\u00b5\u03b1\u0393 \u03bd\u00b5\u03bd . Substituting Eq. (14) with (17) and eliminating the boundary term, we will have\nS = \u2212 \u222b \u221a\u2212gg\u00b5\u03bd ( L\u03b1\u03c3\u00b5L \u03c3 \u03bd\u03b1 \u2212 L\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1L\u03c3\u00b5\u03bd ) d4x , (18)\nwhich is nothing but the nonmetricity scalar in action (15), namely\nQ = g\u00b5\u03bd ( \u2212L\u03b1\u03c3\u00b5L\u03c3\u03bd\u03b1 + L\u03b1\u03c3\u03b1L\u03c3\u00b5\u03bd ) . (19)\nBut we have to notice, Eq. (18) is not the standard Einstein-Hilbert action as in Eq. (17), and the difference between these two equations exists by the presence of a total derivative term. Thus, the nonmetricity scalar and Ricci scalar also differ from each other due to this total derivative term, namely\nR({ }) = Q\u2212\u2207\u03b1 ( Q\u03b1 \u2212 Q\u0303\u03b1 ) . (20)\nHowever, the situation will be significantly different if we move to f(Q) gravity because the total derivative term in the CGR action will no longer be a boundary term in f(Q) gravity.\n2 The first term of action (17) is known as Einstein action because Einstein himself formulated it in the first place. Variation of Einstein action toward metric directly gives Einstein tensor without adding any applicable boundary term, for example, Gibbons-Hawking-York boundary term. However, this property is at the expense of general covariance.\n5 B. Hamiltonian formulation\nIn this section, we will encapsulate the Hamiltonian analysis for CGR by following Ref. [34]. In ADM formalism, the space-time metric is written as\nds2 = \u2212N2dt2 + hij ( dxi +N idt ) ( dxj +N jdt ) , (21)\nwhere N , N i, hij are the lapse function, the shift function and the three-dimensional spatial metric. Using the above variable, it is straightforward to represent a four-dimensional metric as follows:\ng\u00b5\u03bd =\n( \u2212N2 +NiN i Ni\nNi hij\n)\n,\ng\u00b5\u03bd = ( \u2212N\u22122 N\u22122N i N\u22122N i hij \u2212 NiNj\nN2\n)\n.\n(22)\nInserting the above metric into (15) and dropping the boundary terms bring the CGR Lagrangian into the form 3\nS[g] = \u222b d4x \u221a hN [ 3Q\u2212Dl(3Ql \u2212 3Q\u0303l) +KijKij \u2212K2 ] , (23)\nwhere 3Q = hik ( \u0393mil\u0393 l km \u2212 \u0393 lik\u0393mlm ) is three-dimensional non-metricity scalar, Kij = 1 2N\n( h\u0307ij \u2212DiNj \u2212DjNi ) is\nthe extrinsic curvature of the hypersurface, and K = hijKij is the trace of Kij . However, not all canonical ADM variables in (22) are independent. They will be related through the primary constraints\n\u03c0N = \u03b4S\n\u03b4N\u0307 = 0 ,\n\u03c0i = \u03b4S\n\u03b4N\u0307i = 0 .\n(24)\nTherefore, canonical Hamiltonian density can be constructed in the following structure\nH =\n\u222b\n\u03a3t\nd3x ( \u03bb\u03c0N + \u03bb i\u03c0i +H0 )\n=\n\u222b\n\u03a3t\nd3x ( \u03bb\u03c0N + \u03bb i\u03c0i +NC0 +N iCi ) ,\n(25)\nwhere \u03bb, \u03bbi are Lagrange multipliers which can be ignored since \u03c0N and \u03c0i are first-class (FC) constraints. Moreover, C0, Ci provide secondary constraints [34]\nC0 := \u2212 \u221a h\n[\n3Q\u2212Dl(3Ql \u2212 3Q\u0303l)\u2212 1\nh\n(\n\u03c0ij\u03c0 ij \u2212 1\n2\n( \u03c0ii )2 )] !\u2248 0 ,\nCi := \u22122Dj\u03c0j i !\u2248 0 .\n(26)\nWe can see that the above has a very similar form to GR. The demand for preservation over time requests Poisson brackets (PBs) between the Hamiltonian and secondary constraints equal to zero; this leads to the following equations\n{C0(x), H} = \u222b\n\u03a3t\nd3y ( N(y) {C0(x), C0(y)}+N i(y) {C0(x), Ci(y)} ) ,\n{Ci(x), H} = \u222b\n\u03a3t\nd3y ( N(y) {Ci(x), C0(y)} +N j(y) {Ci(x), Cj(y)} ) .\n(27)\n3 Partial integration would not affect the numbers of d.o.f of the system, and we shall see in Sec. III, the action (23) can be obtained more efficiently by using (35) than applying direct decomposition.\n6 To obtain the constraint algebra efficiently, we consider the quantities in the following way\nCS(N) :=\n\u222b\n\u03a3t\nNC0 d 3x ,\nCV ( ~N) :=\n\u222b\n\u03a3t\nN iCi d 3x .\n(28)\nAfter elaborate calculations, the following PBs can be written in the form of the Lie derivative. After using (28) and (26), the constraint algebra turns out to be zero\n{ CS(N), CV ( ~N) } = \u2212CS ( L ~NN ) = 0 ,\n{ CV ( ~N1), CV ( ~N2) } = CV ( [ ~N1, ~N1] ) = 0 , {CS (N1) , CS (N2)} = CV (( N1\u2202 iN2 \u2212N2\u2202iN1 ) \u2202i ) = 0 .\n(29)\nThat means the consistency conditions (27) are automatically satisfied after using the secondary constraints, and (29) show all eight constraints are FC 4, and the Lagrange multipliers \u03bb, \u03bbi remain arbitrary. Thus, the d.o.f. of the CGR is 10\u2212 8 = 2, which is the same as the number of propagating modes with GR. This result confirms that the CGR and GR are somewhat equivalent. Actually, (23) is identical to the Gauss-Codazzi form of the Hilbert-Einstein action, as we will prove in the next section.\nIII. ADM DECOMPOSITION OF f(Q) GRAVITY\nIn this section, we attempt to apply the approach developed in the preceding section to f(Q) gravity. To establish the 3+1 decomposition of a generic f(Q) gravity theory, we decompose the space-time onto a three-dimensional manifold \u03a3t and express the nonmetricity scalar restricted to the hypersurfaces. We start by recalling the corresponding GaussCodazzi action in GR. Then, we utilize its results and the relationship between the nonmetricity scalar and Ricci scalar to establish ADM formalism in the f(Q) scenario. In this sense, depending on the corresponding prescription, the direction of time T \u00b5 can be decomposed into components tangential and orthogonal to the hypersurface \u03a3t\nT \u00b5 = Nn\u00b5 +N\u00b5 ,\nwhere n\u00b5 is defined as a unit vector normal to the hypersurface, satisfying the normalization condition n\u00b5n\u00b5 = \u22121, and all indices are raised and lowered by g\u00b5\u03bd . The explicit form of n\u00b5 and n\n\u00b5 in terms of their components can be written as\nn\u00b5 = ( \u2212N, 0, 0, 0 ) , n\u00b5 = ( 1/N, \u2212N i/N ) .\n(30)\nWe choose the ADM metric Eq. (22) where the induced metric hij lying on \u03a3t orthogonal to normal vector h \u00b5\u03bdn\u03bd = 0, also fulfilling the relation\nh\u00b5\u03bd = g\u00b5\u03bd + n\u00b5n\u03bd =\n( NiN\ni Ni Ni hij\n)\n,\nh\u00b5\u03bd = g\u00b5\u03bd + n\u00b5n\u03bd = ( 0 0 0 hij ) ,\nhence the four-dimensional Ricci scalar, defined by the connection compatible with the spacetime metric, can be expressed in terms of the intrinsic and extrinsic curvature on the hypersurface \u03a3t as follows [41]\n\u221a\u2212gR = \u221a hN ( 3R+KijKij \u2212K2 ) + 2 \u221a\u2212g [\u2207\u00b5 (n\u00b5\u2207\u03bdn\u03bd)\u2212\u2207\u03bd (n\u00b5\u2207\u00b5n\u03bd)] . (31)\n4 In phase space, a dynamical variable is called FC if it has weakly vanishing PBs with all constraints. If one is not FC, we call it second-class (SC).\n7 In order to facilitate our further calculations, it is convenient to rephrase f(Q) gravity as a scalar-nonmetricity theory, with the assistance of an auxiliary scalar field [42]\nSf(Q) =\n\u222b\nd4x \u221a \u2212g [f \u2032(\u03d5)Q + f(\u03d5)\u2212 \u03d5f \u2032(\u03d5)] , (32)\nwhere f is an arbitrary function of auxiliary field \u03d5, and the \u2032 is the derivative with respect to \u03d5. On the other hand, we know from Eq. (20) that the nonmetricity scalar can be written in terms of the Ricci scalar up to the total derivative term. Inserting (20) into (32) gives\nSf(Q) =\n\u222b\nd4x \u221a\u2212g [ f \u2032R+ f \u2032\u2207\u03b1 ( Q\u03b1 \u2212 Q\u0303\u03b1 ) + f \u2212 \u03d5f \u2032 ] . (33)\nCombining it with (31), we can express the f(Q) action by the spatial curvature scalar in following form\nSf(Q) =\n\u222b\nd4x \u221a\u2212g [ f \u2032 ( 3R+KijKij \u2212K2 + 2\u2207\u00b5 (n\u00b5\u2207\u03bdn\u03bd)\u2212 2\u2207\u03bd (n\u00b5\u2207\u00b5n\u03bd) )\n+f \u2032\u2207\u03b1 ( Q\u03b1 \u2212 Q\u0303\u03b1 ) + f \u2212 \u03d5f \u2032 ] .\n(34)\nFurthermore, we prove that there exists an analogous relationship between the intrinsic nonmetricity scalar 3Q and the intrinsic curvature 3R, which we have explicitly shown in Appendix A\n3R = 3Q\u2212Dl(3Ql \u2212 3Q\u0303l) . (35)\nInserting (35) into (34) and after tedious calculations to the boundary terms presented in Appendix B, we give the action to the following form\nSf(Q) =\n\u222b\nd4x { N \u221a h [ f + f \u2032 ( 3Q+KijK ij \u2212K2 \u2212 \u03d5 ) \u2212Dl[f \u2032(3Ql \u2212 3Q\u0303l)] ]\n+\n\u221a h\nN \u03d5\u0307f \u2032\u2032 ( \u2202iN i ) \u2212\n\u221a h\nN N\u0307 i\u2202if\n\u2032 \u2212 \u221a h\nN \u2202if\n\u2032 (N i\u2202jN j \u2212Nk\u2202kN i )\n}\n.\n(36)\nThis is the final decomposed action of f(Q) gravity which we will pursue in the following sections.\nIV. HAMITONIAN FORMULATION IN f(Q) GRAVITY\nIn this section, we apply the standard Dirac-Bergmann algorithm [29, 30] to f(Q) gravity. First of all, it is useful\nto note that the relation of N\u0307 i and N\u0307i can be expressed as\nN\u0307 i\u2202if \u2032 = \u2202if \u2032 \u02d9(Njhij) = \u2202if \u2032N\u0307jh ij + \u2202if \u2032Njh\u0307 ij\n= \u2202if \u2032N\u0307i \u2212 \u2202if \u2032N j h\u0307ij . (37)\nMoreover, by defining Aij := \u221a h\nN N j\u2202if \u2032 and Bi := ( N i\u2202jN j \u2212N j\u2202jN i ) , we rephrase action (36) into following form\nSf(Q) =\n\u222b\nd4x { N \u221a h [ f + f \u2032 ( 3Q+KijK ij \u2212K2 \u2212 \u03d5 ) \u2212Dl[f \u2032(3Ql \u2212 3Q\u0303l)] ]\n+\n\u221a h\nN \u03d5\u0307f \u2032\u2032 ( \u2202iN i ) \u2212\n\u221a h\nN\n( \u2202if \u2032 ) N\u0307i +A ij h\u0307ij \u2212 \u221a h\nN (\u2202if\n\u2032)Bi\n}\n.\n(38)\nThere are 11 dynamical variables in total, N , Ni, hij , \u03d5. Note that Ni has three components, and hij has six components because of the index symmetry. In order to perform the Hamiltonian formalism of a dynamical system,\n8 we introduce, in the usual way, the corresponding conjugate momenta which are defined by\n\u03c0N \u2261 \u03b4S \u03b4N\u0307 = 0 ,\n\u03c0i \u2261 \u03b4S \u03b4N\u0307i\n= \u2212 \u221a h\nN \u2202if \u2032 ,\n\u03c0ij \u2261 \u03b4S \u03b4h\u0307ij\n= \u221a h [ f \u2032 ( Kij \u2212 hijK )] +Aij ,\np \u2261 \u03b4S \u03b4\u03d5\u0307 =\n\u221a h\nN f \u2032\u2032 ( \u2202iN i ) .\n(39)\nThe fundamental PBs 5 among the canonical variables in phase space are given by\n{N(x), \u03c0N (y)} = \u03b4(3)(~x\u2212 ~y) , { N i(x), \u03c0j(y) } = \u03b4ij\u03b4\n(3)(~x\u2212 ~y) , {hij(x), \u03c0mn(y)} = \u03b4m(i \u03b4nj)\u03b4(3)(~x\u2212 ~y) .\n(40)\nAccording to the Dirac-Bergmann algorithm, the conjugate momenta in Eq. (39) will become constraints of the system if they do not contain the corresponding velocities, which means that the latter cannot be obtained inversely. To see how many constraints there are in Eq. (39), we check the following matrix 6\nWab = \u2202\u03a0a \u2202q\u0307b =\n\n            \n0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 ... ... . . . ... ... . . . ...\n... 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 f1 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 ... ... . . . ... ... . . . ...\n... 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 f6 0 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 0 0\n\n            \n \n 3\n \n 6\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n3\n\ufe38 \ufe37\ufe37 \ufe38\n6\n, a = (\n\u03c0N\n\ufe37\ufe38\ufe38\ufe37\n0 ,\n\u03c0i\n\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37 0, . . . , 0,\n\u03c0ij\n\ufe37 \ufe38\ufe38 \ufe37 0, . . . , 0,\np \ufe37\ufe38\ufe38\ufe37\n0 ) (41)\nNote that Wab is a 11\u00d7 11 symmetric matrix with all components zero, except for those six diagonal elements. So the rank of Wab is M = 6, that give rise to 11\u2212 6 = 5 primary constraints\n\u03c6a : \u03c0N !\u2248 0 ,\n\u03c6i : \u03c0i +\n\u221a h\nN \u2202if\n\u2032 !\u2248 0 ,\n\u03c6c : p\u2212 \u221a h\nN f \u2032\u2032 ( \u2202iN i ) !\u2248 0 ,\n(42)\nwhere the symbol ! stands for demand. The linear combination of the primary constraints (42) defining the hypersurface intersection \u03a31, guarantees the phase-space variables are weakly equal 7 to zero.\nThe independence checking 8 of these primary constraints are given by Jacobian matrix Jn\u2032n = \u2202\u03c6n\u2032\n\u2202(qn,pn) . If the rank\nof matrix Jn\u2032n equals M \u2032, it means there only exist M \u2032 independent primary constraints among (42) [27]. In our case,\n5 The PBs between two functions F (x) and G(x) of the phase-space variables { N,N i, hij , \u03d5, \u03c0N , \u03c0i, \u03c0 ij , p } is defined as [34]:\n{F (x), G(y)} :=\n\u222b\n\u03a3t\nd3z \u2211\nk\n(\n\u03b4F (x) \u03b4\u03a6k(z) \u03b4G(y) \u03b4\u03a0k(z) \u2212 \u03b4G(y) \u03b4\u03a6k(z) \u03b4F (x) \u03b4\u03a0k(z)\n)\n6 Some papers call it Hessian: Hab = \u22022L\n\u2202q\u0307a\u2202q\u0307b , which is exactly same as matrix: Wab.\n7 If the restriction of phase-space variables vanishes on \u03c6 (p, q), we say \u03c6 (p, q) is weakly equal to zero, and we label it by \u2248. In addition, if function \u03c6 (p, q) and all its first derivatives vanish on \u03a31, then we say \u03c6 (p, q) is strongly equal to zero, labeled by =. 8 Under general consideration, the primary constraints (42) may be reducible; thus we can split them into independent part and an dependent part. If the matrix Jn\u2032n is full rank then it is called as a regularity condition.\n9 it is not hard to check Jn\u2032n is full rank matrix, so that M \u2032 = 5, it suggests the \u03a31 is a phase-space submanifold of dimension 2N \u2212M \u2032 = 17. Since \u03c6i and \u03c6c are dependent on N and \u03d5, all PBs between different primary constraints remain nonvanishing. The nonvanishing PBs are listed below\n{\u03c6a(x), \u03c6i(y)} = \u221a h\nN2 \u2202if\n\u2032 \u03b43(x\u2212 y) ,\n{\u03c6a(x), \u03c6c(y)} = \u2212 \u221a h\nN2 f \u2032\u2032 ( \u2202iN i ) \u03b43(x\u2212 y) ,\n{\u03c6c(x), \u03c6i(y)} = \u2212 \u221a h\nN f \u2032\u2032\u2032\u2202i\u03d5 \u03b4\n3(x \u2212 y)\u2212 2 \u221a h\nN f \u2032\u2032\u2202i\u03b4 3(x\u2212 y) .\n(43)\nOn the other hand, the remaining six equations can be inversely solved to get \u02d9hij . Defining \u03c0 = hij\u03c0 ij and\nA = hijA ij , from (39) we can get: \u03c0 = \u22122 \u221a hf \u2032K + A, K = A\u2212\u03c0\n2 \u221a hf \u2032 . Substituting back to (39) yields the following\nrelationships\nKij = 1\u221a hf \u2032\n[\n\u03c0ij \u2212Aij + 1 2 hij (A\u2212 \u03c0)\n]\n,\nKijK ij \u2212K2 = 1\nhf \u20322\n[ ( \u03c0ij \u2212Aij ) (\u03c0ij \u2212Aij)\u2212 1\n2 (A\u2212 \u03c0)2\n]\n,\n(44)\nhence\nh\u0307ij = 2NKij + 2D(iNj)\n= 2N\u221a hf \u2032\n[\n\u03c0ij \u2212Aij + 1\n2 hij(A\u2212 \u03c0)\n]\n+ 2D(iNj) . (45)\nNow we return to further development of the Hamiltonian formalism. We define the total Hamiltonian in the traditional form\nH =\n\u222b\n\u03a3t\nH d3x\n=\n\u222b\n\u03a3t\nd3x ( \u03bba\u03c0N + \u03bb i\u03c6i + \u03bb c\u03c6c + H0 ) ,\n(46)\nin which H0 represents the canonical Hamiltonian density\nH0 : = \u03c0 ij h\u0307ij + \u03c0 iN\u0307i + p\u03d5\u0307\u2212 L\n= NC + 2D(iNj) ( \u03c0ij \u2212Aij ) +\n\u221a h\nN \u2202if\n\u2032Bi\n= NC + 2DiNj\u03c0ij \u2212 \u221a h\nN \u2202if\n\u2032 (N j\u2202iNj \u2212N i\u2202jN j + 2N j\u2202jN i ) ,\nC = 1\u221a hf \u2032\n[ ( \u03c0ij \u2212Aij ) (\u03c0ij \u2212Aij)\u2212 1\n2 (A\u2212 \u03c0)2\n]\n\u2212 \u221a h{f + f \u2032 ( 3Q\u2212 \u03d5 ) \u2212Dl[f \u2032(3Ql \u2212 3Q\u0303l)]} , (47)\nwhile \u03bba, \u03bbi and \u03bbc are arbitrary Lagrangian multipliers. In order to find out the evolution of the constraints (39), we need to check whether the consistency conditions for these constraints could be satisfied. The consistency conditions require that the time derivative of these constraints, which can be transformed into the PBs between the constraint functions with the Hamiltonian, also vanish on a new hypersurface \u03a32 of lower dimension than \u03a31. This leads to the following equations:\n\u03c6\u0307n\u2032 = {\u03c6n\u2032 ,H }\n\u2248 {\u03c6n\u2032 ,H0}+ {\u03c6n\u2032 , \u03c6n}\u03bbn !\u2248 0 , n \u2208 (a, i, c) .\n(48)\n10\nSuch conditions can be satisfied if they have solutions for all the multipliers. To check this, we have to compute the rank of the following matrix:\nCn\u2032n = {\u03c6n\u2032 , \u03c6n} =\n\n    0 A1 A2 A3 \u2212B \u2212A1 0 0 0 C1 \u2212A2 0 0 0 C2 \u2212A3 0 0 0 C3 B \u2212C1 \u2212C2 \u2212C3 0\n\n    , (49)\nwhere we define \u221a h\nN f \u2032\u2032 ( \u2202iN i ) := S ,\n\u221a h\nN \u2202if\n\u2032 := Vi , {\u03c0N , Vi} \u2261 Ai = (A1, A2, A3) , {Vi, p}+ {S, \u03c0i} \u2261 Ci = (C1, C2, C3) . (50)\nWe find the det(Cn\u2032n) = 0 and its rank is 4, which is consistent with the fact that Cn\u2032n is an antisymmetric matrix of odd order. This means the multipliers are not yet uniquely determined, and we need to find another constraint condition. Such a constraint condition can be made by contracting the null eigenvector of matrix Cn\u2032n\n\u03ben = ( 0, A[3C2], A[1C3], A[2C1], 0 ) , (51)\nand hn \u2261 ({\u03c6n,H0}), namely,\n\u03c7 = \u03benhn = \u03be i ({\u03c0i,H0}+ {Vi,H0}) !\u2248 0 . (52)\nThe extra constraint imposed by the null eigenvector should be the secondary constraint [43, 44]. The presence of secondary constraints are independent of previous constraints \u03c6n, and restrict the motion in phase space to a new hypersurface \u03a32 of lower dimension than \u03a31. Now, we have five primary constraints and one secondary constraint, these six constraints ought to be preserved during the evolution of the system. Hence the consistency equation for the above six constraints leads to\n0 \u2248 \u03c6\u0307a = {\u03c6a,H0}+ {\u03c6a, \u03c6n}\u03bbn\n= {\u03c0N ,H0}+ {\u03c0N , \u03c6i}\u03bbi + {\u03c0N , \u03c6c}\u03bbc\n= {\u03c0N ,H0}+ {\u03c0N , Vi}\u03bbi \u2212 {\u03c0N , S}\u03bbc , (53) 0 \u2248 \u03c6\u0307i = {\u03c6i,H0}+ {\u03c6i, \u03c6n}\u03bbn = {\u03c0i,H0}+ {Vi,H0} \u2212 {\u03c0N , Vi}\u03bba + {S, \u03c0i}\u03bbc + {Vi, p}\u03bbc , (54)\n0 \u2248 \u03c6\u0307c = {\u03c6c,H0}+ {\u03c6c, \u03c6n}\u03bbn\n= {p,H0} \u2212 {S,H0}+ {\u03c0N , S}\u03bba \u2212 {S, \u03c0i}\u03bbi \u2212 {Vi, p}\u03bbi , (55) 0 \u2248 \u03c7\u0307 = {\u03c7,H0}+ {\u03c7, \u03c6n}\u03bbn . (56)\nFrom the above consistency evolution treatment of constrained dynamics, we hope that some initially undermined Lagrange multipliers can be eventually determined by Eqs. (53)-(56). We will check this point in the next section.\nV. DEGREES OF FREEDOM OF f(Q) GRAVITY\nA. Counting the degrees of freedom\nIn this section, we will test whether the hypersurface surfaces \u03a3 = \u03a31 \u2229 \u03a32 9are final constraint surfaces. This consideration drive us to combine the consistency condition of secondary constraint (56) with the previous Cn\u2032n to\n9 \u03a3 is the constraint surface determined by Eqs. (42) and the Eq. (52) .\n11\nconsist of a new matrix \u03a6mn\n(\u03a6mn) \u2261 [\nCn\u2032n {\u03c7, \u03c6n}\n]\n=\n\n      0 A1 A2 A3 \u2212B \u2212A1 0 0 0 C1 \u2212A2 0 0 0 C2 \u2212A3 0 0 0 C3 B \u2212C1 \u2212C2 \u2212C3 0\n{\u03c7, \u03c6a} {\u03c7, \u03c6x} {\u03c7, \u03c6y} {\u03c7, \u03c6z} {\u03c7, \u03c6c}\n\n      . (57)\nAt this stage, we are facing two possibilities. If the rank of \u03a6mn is still 4, it means there must exist a column vector \u03b6n which satisfying the relation Cn\u2032n\u03b6\nn \u2248 0 and {\u03c7, \u03c6n} \u03b6n \u2248 0, leads us to construct a new constraint \u03c60 = \u03b6n\u03c6n. By a linear combination of primary constraints, one can prove this constraint \u03c60 must be FC [27, 43]. Then, the consistency condition of \u03c60 must be checked further. On the other hand, if the rank of \u03a6mn is maximum, i.e., equal to 5, it means the consistency conditions (53)-(56) contain five linearly independent equations for the Lagrange multipliers, so that the five Lagrange multipliers can be solved as a function of the phase-space variables. Inserting these Lagrange multipliers back into Eqs. (53)-(56), we will certainly see that the consistency conditions for all constraints are automatically satisfied. Based on the above discussion, we check the specific form of Eq. (52)\n\u03c7 = \u03bei ({\u03c0i,H0}+ {Vi,H0}) = \u03bex ({\u03c0x,H0}+ {Vx,H0}) + \u03bey ({\u03c0y,H0}+ {Vy ,H0}) + \u03bez ({\u03c0z,H0}+ {Vz ,H0}) = (A3C2 \u2212A2C3) {\u03c0x + Vx,H0}+ (A1C3 \u2212A3C1) {\u03c0y + Vy,H0}+ (A2C1 \u2212A1C2) {\u03c0z + Vz ,H0} .\n(58)\nAlthough very complicated in the details, if we analyze (58) carefully we will find that it possesses good symmetry in its components. The possibility that (\u03a6mn) becomes a reducible (nonfull rank) case requires at least the {\u03c7, \u03c6x} , {\u03c7, \u03c6y} , {\u03c7, \u03c6z} vanish simultaneously, which we note are very strict conditions. For example, \u03c6x = \u03c0x + \u221a h\nN \u2202xf \u2032 means that \u03c7 cannot contain the corresponding Nx, \u03c0ij , and \u03c0N . This is very easily disproved: We consider the first term of \u03c7 from (47), variate H0 with respect to N x and \u03c0ij respectively\n\u222b\n\u03a3t\n\u03b4H0|Nx = \u2212 \u222b\n\u03a3t\n2 \u221a hDj ( \u03c0jx\u221a h ) \u03b4Nx \u2212 \u222b\n\u03a3t\nFx(hij , N, \u03d5,N i)\u03b4Nx ,\n\u222b\n\u03a3t\n\u03b4H0|\u03c0ij = \u222b\n\u03a3t\nN\u221a hf \u2032 ( 2\u03c0ij \u2212 \u03c0hij ) \u03b4\u03c0ij +\n\u222b\n\u03a3t\n2DiN j\u03b4\u03c0ij , (59)\nwhere Fx is a function of hij , N , \u03d5 and N i with a very complicated form. Then we can express the following PBs as\n{\u03c0x(x),H0(y)} = [ 2 \u221a hDj ( \u03c0jx\u221a h ) + Fx(hij , N, \u03d5,N i) ] \u03b43(x\u2212 y) , {Vx(x),H0(y)} = (\u03c0\n2 \u2212 \u221a hDjN j ) \u2202x ln f \u2032 \u03b43(x\u2212 y) .\n(60)\nWe can see that {\u03c0x + Vx,H0} contains terms like N j , \u03c0 and so on, while the term (A3C2 \u2212A2C3) is nonvanishing. This indicates that Nx, \u03c0ij must appear in \u03c7, which gives rise to\n{\u03c7, \u03c6i} 6= 0 . (61)\nTherefore, the rank of \u03a6mn is 5, which shows that all five Lagrange multipliers can be uniquely determined by (53)- (56), thus there is no further secondary constraint, all consistency conditions are exhausted, and the algorithm is finished. Moreover, by Eqs. (43) and (61), we know by definition that all the primary and secondary constraints are SC. Finally, we can determine the number of d.o.f. in f(Q) gravity,\nD.o.f. = 1 2 \u00b7 ( Number of original canonical variables \u2212 Total number of constraints \u2212 Number of gauge conditions )\n= 1 2 \u00b7 ( Number of original canonical variables \u2212 2\u00d7 Number of FC constraints \u2212 Number of SC constraints )\n= 1\n2 \u00b7 (22\u2212 0\u2212 6) = 8 .\n(62)\n12\nB. Interpretation of degrees of freedom\nIn this subsection, we try discuss about the origin of 8 d.o.f. in f(Q) gravity. and then, we make a comparison between f(Q) with the other two in the geometrical trinity of gravity named f(T ) and f(R) gravity. Starting from Sec. II, we have shown that there are eight FC constraints in CGR, which cause all the Lagrange multipliers to stay arbitrary. As a consequence, the evolution of dynamical variables in phase space cannot be uniquely determined by their initial values, and it corresponds to the fact that CGR possesses the same gauge symmetry as that in GR. As a matter of fact, four constraints (26) describe general coordinate transformation, and the rest og the four FC constraints (24) can be utilized to fix the nondynamical fields N and N i. Then it reduces the total variables from ten to two. However, when we extend the action of CGR to the general case, the situation becomes quite different: When we remove the inertial connection \u0393\u0302\u03b1\u00b5\u03b2 = \u2202x\u03b1 \u2202\u03be\u03c1 \u2202\u00b5\u2202\u03b2\u03be \u03c1 by means of diff. (x\u03b1 = \u03be\u03c1), the connection vanishes, and the nonmetricity Q\u03b1\u00b5\u03bd is no longer a tensor in general sense (it does not follow the transformation rules under the general coordinate transformation), and the action is only invariant when the boundary term shows up [21]. We can see this point more clearly if we consider the arbitrary gauge \u0393\u0302\u03b1\u00b5\u03b2 = \u2202x\u03b1 \u2202\u03be\u03c1 \u2202\u00b5\u2202\u03b2\u03be \u03c1 and coincident gauge \u0393\u0302\u03b1\u00b5\u03b2 = 0 for two circumstances. By using (8), each condition gives us noncurvature condition. Combining Eqs. (19) and (10) yields\nR+\u2207\u00b5 ( Q\u0303\u00b5 \u2212Q\u00b5 ) \u2212Q = R+\u2207\u00b5 ( \u02dc\u0302Q\u00b5 \u2212 Q\u0302\u00b5 ) \u2212 Q\u0302 = 0 . (63)\nTo differentiate, here we use Q\u0302(g\u00b5\u03bd , \u0393\u0302\u03b1\u00b5\u03b2) to represent the nonmetricity scalar for the arbitrary gauge and Q(g\u00b5\u03bd , 0) for coincident gauge. It follows that\n\u221a\u2212g Q(g\u00b5\u03bd , 0) = \u221a\u2212g Q\u0302(g\u00b5\u03bd , \u0393\u0302\u03b1\u00b5\u03b2) + \u2202\u00b5 [\u221a\u2212g(B\u00b5 \u2212 B\u0302\u00b5) ] , (64)\nin which B\u00b5(g\u00b5\u03bd , 0) = Q\u0303\u00b5 \u2212Q\u00b5 and B\u0302\u00b5(g\u00b5\u03bd , \u0393\u0302\u03b1\u00b5\u03b2) = \u02dc\u0302Q\u00b5 \u2212Q\u0302\u00b5. It explicitly shows that the boundary term eliminated by integration and gives a covariant Q(g\u00b5\u03bd , 0), but this is only for the case when fQQ = 0. Let us consider the general case of f(Q) gravity, where namely fQQ is not necessarily zero. In this case, the action is no longer diff. invariant x\u2032\u00b5 = x\u00b5 + \u03b5\u00b5 (x) in the coincident gauge. From the consideration of this point, it follows that no FC constraints should exist in this theory, which is consistent with the findings that all six constraints \u03c6a, \u03c6i, \u03c6c and \u03c7 are SC. Moreover, one can easily find that the noncommutativity of these constraints is mainly caused by the fact that the canonical momenta of Ni and \u03d5 are nonvanishing. Recalling the action (38), we find that the action contains the terms linear to the velocity of the variables Ni and \u03d5. In the Lagrangian formulation, such linear terms suggest that the equation of motion only involves the first-order time derivatives of Ni and \u03d5. Since the wave equation requires second-order time derivatives, we can interpret that Ni and \u03d5 are dynamical but do not propagate; in other words, N i and \u03d5 carry a half d.o.f. In Hamiltonian formulation, the six SC constraints (\u03c6a, \u03c6i, \u03c6c, \u03c7) can be regarded as determining any six phase-space variables that appear in the given constraints. Hence, one can choose which variables are expressed in terms of the others 10. Finally, four of ten variables (N,Ni, \u03d5, \u03c0\nN , \u03c0i, p) are dynamical ones, and if we choose Ni and \u03d5 as independent variables, we can again interpret that each of the variables in Ni and \u03d5 carries a half degree of freedom. We observe that the above situation is very different from the case of GR or CGR, or even f(R) and f(T ) gravity. Note that in f(R) gravity, the scalar field momentum p is not a constraint [45], but rather a real dynamical variable. f(R) gravity has 10+ 1 = 11 apparent d.o.f. While it preserves the diff. symmetry, all the eight constraints (primary and secondary) are FCs, and f(R) gravity has 3 physical d.o.f. [45]. In f(T ) gravity, where the building blocks are tetrad rather than metric, there are 16 + 1 = 17 apparent d.o.f.. It preserves diff. symmetry but breaks down the local Lorentz symmetry (six SC constraints), while they need additional 2 SC constraints to eliminate the auxiliary scalar field. So, we have eight FC constraints and eight SC constraints, and f(T ) gravity has 5 physical d.o.f. [35]. We compare the three gravitational theories explicitly in Table II.\n10 It can be proved that with the help of Eq. (15), we can change the form of action (38) by applying ADM decomposition towards the action (32) straightforwardly. In such a way the variable without time derivative in Lagrangian transform from lapse function N to auxiliary field \u03d5. However, this is only a mathematical transformation without any real physical meaning.\n13\nAlthough the above three theories show different features, we can also find similarities among them, giving us a better understanding of the dynamics in the f(Q) gravity. In contrast to f(R) gravity, the other two theories show the SC constraints. As was discussed, we have eight SC constraints in f(T ) gravity, where six of eight reflect the breakdown of the local Lorentz symmetry, and two of eight reflect the nondynamical scalar field. In the same way, we can interpret six SC constraints in f(Q) gravity; that is, four of six reflects the breakdown of the diff. symmetry and two of six reflect the nondynamical scalar field. On the other hand, the symmetry is manifest, and the scalar field is dynamical in f(R) gravity. This is because the equation of motion in f(R) gravity includes a fourth-order derivative, which is decomposed into two second-order derivative equations, and thus both metric and scalar fields are dynamical. As a side remark, we would like to make speculations on what type of d.o.f. these might be. From viewpoint of space-time decomposition, the induced metric hij contains two scalar-(S), two vector-(V), and two tensor-(T) d.o.f. Due to the breakdown of diff. symmetry, all these 6 d.o.f. are preserved. While the shift function Ni can be decomposed into the gradient of a scalar plus a divergenceless vector, N and Ni contain a total of 2 scalar and 2 vector d.o.f. However, variables only carry a half d.o.f. as we discussed. Thus, we have in total three possible interpretations of these 8 d.o.f.; they correspond to (2 S, 4V, 2T), (3 S, 3V, 2T), and (4 S, 2V, 2T) respectively. However, determining which is the right choice is beyond the scope of our paper, and we will handle it in a future study.\nVI. CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION\nIn gauge theories, redundant d.o.f. may exist, some of which are closely related to the gauge symmetry, i.e., invariance under the gauge transformation. In the Hamiltonian formalism, they are characterized by the presence of constraints. The symmetries inherent in a theory can be explored by performing a Hamiltonian analysis. The three gravity theories, namely GR, TEGR, and STEGR, are well known to be equivalent to each other, despite a total derivative acting as a boundary term. Therefore, they have the same number of physical d.o.f.. That is why people call them the \u201cgeometrical trinity.\u201d However, their variants, namely f(R), f(T ), and f(Q), will not be equivalent to each other because, in a functional form, the total derivative term can no longer be a boundary term. While the d.o.f. of the first two theories are already known, in this paper, we developed the Hamiltonian formalism for f(Q) gravity in the framework of the coincident gauge. Making use of the ADM formalism and after tedious calculations, we succeeded in expressing the action in terms of ADM variables. We found that different from the widely studied f(R) and f(T ) gravity theories, the ADM action of f(Q) gravity contains terms linear to the velocity of its variables Ni and \u03d5, which will have significant effects on its geometric structure. These variables cannot be seen as dynamical ones because of the lack of their kinetic terms; however, their canonical momenta do not vanish as usual constraints in GR. Therefore, we can interpret these variables as dynamical but non-propagating d.o.f., which will also contribute to the physical degree of freedom, but lack the capability to propagate. Then we performed the standard Dirac-Bergmann algorithm to the action and notably showed there are five primary constraints (\u03c6a, \u03c6i, \u03c6c) and one secondary constraint \u03c7 in the whole system. After calculating the nonvanishing PBs between all constraints, we proved all of them are SC, which implies that the diff. symmetry is broken. Therefore, we concluded that in four dimensions, the physical d.o.f. in general coincident relativity is 8. The richness of the physical d.o.f. is not only due to the broken diff. symmetry but due to the contributions from nonpropagating variables such as Ni and \u03d5. We also presented a comparison of our results with f(R) and f(T ) gravity theories. We further note a possible analogy to the massive gravity in the light of symmetry breaking [46\u201348]. Massive gravity describes the self-interacting massive spin-2 field theory (so-called massive graviton), and the mass term explicitly breaks diff. symmetry. Consequently, we have no FC constraint, but two SC constraints show up in massive gravity. Thus, massive gravity predicts five physical d.o.f. corresponding to the 5 helicities of the massive spin-2 field. As seen above, we have no FC constraint but the SC constraints in the f(Q) gravity with the coincident gauge. In the same way as the massive gravity, we can restore the diff. symmetry by introducing the Stukelberg fields to compensate for the symmetry [42], which several works have argued as the covariant formulation of f(Q) gravity.\n14\nThe covariant formulation of f(Q) gravity can complete our analysis of the mode decomposition in the present work. Although we determined the number of physical d.o.f. and demonstrated possible interpretations for each mode, we cannot uniquely determine the mode decomposition. Based on the covariant formulation, we will be able to discuss the origin of each mode clearly, which provides us with the complete information of physical d.o.f.. We hope our work will reveal the dark side of exploring the basic perception of f(Q) gravity and provide new insights into cosmological perturbation theory, which is also a project we plan to undertake in the future.\nAcknowledgments\nThe authors thank M.
