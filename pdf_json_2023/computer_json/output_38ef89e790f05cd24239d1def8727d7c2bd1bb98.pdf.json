    "abstractText": "The continuing effects of climate change require farmers and growers to have greater understanding of how these changes affect crop production. However, while climatic data is generally available to help provide much of that understanding, it can often be in a form not easy to digest. The proposed Combined Location Online Weather Data (CLOWD) framework is an easyto-use online platform for analysing recent and historical weather data of any location within Australia at the click of a map. CLOWD requires no programming skills and operates in any HTML5 web browser on PC and mobile devices. It enables comparison between current and previous growing seasons over a range of environmental parameters, and can create a plainEnglish PDF report for offline use, using natural language generation (NLG). This paper details the platform, the design decisions taken and outlines how farmers and growers can use CLOWD to better understand current growing conditions.

            "text": "The collection and analysis of weather data has long been a fundamental part of the agriculture industry (Hubbard et al., 1983; Wilks and Wilby, 1999). However, as the effects of climate change continue to play out across the globe, data analysis is playing an ever-increasing role in understanding those effects. In Australia, daily weather data is continuously recorded through a nation-wide series of weather stations under the guidance of the Australian Bureau of Meteorology. This data is collated each day by the SILO database project, hosted by the Queensland Government Department of Environment and Science1 (Jeffrey et al., 2001). For a number of weather station locations, this SILO data is available dating back as far as 1899.\nThe SILO project provides access to this raw data through its website. However, there is opportunity to deliver more targeted data analysis, particularly for agricultural purposes, as well as easier access on mobile devices. This paper introduces the proposed Combined Location Online Weather Data (CLOWD) framework that focuses on these goals. CLOWD enables users to choose the location and start date for data analysis, thereby enabling a focus on local growing seasons. It also locally-computes additional data, including growing-degrees days (GDD) (McMaster and Wilhelm, 1997) and incorporates natural language generation (NLG) (Reiter and Dale, 1997) technology to auto-generate plain-language PDF reports.\nMoreover, CLOWD requires only a standard (HTML5) web browser and an internet connection, thus, no additional applications need to be downloaded and installed on the user\u2019s device. Prototypes of the CLOWD platform are now available for PCs/laptops2 and smartphones/tablets3."

            "text": "Decision support tools (DSTs) are an increasingly important component in digital farming around the world (Rose et al., 2016), with those that incorporate smart systems, big data and artificial intelligence, considered part of \u2018Agriculture 4.0\u2019 (Zhai et al., 2020). However, research definitions of DSTs and the outcomes they provide are known to vary. A DST has been previously defined as \u2018a human-computer system which utilises data from various sources, aiming at providing farmers with a list of advice for supporting their decision-making under different circumstances\u2019, but one that does not go so far as to provide direct instructions (Zhai et al., 2020). However, other definitions are more broad, with agriculture-focused DSTs categorised alternatively as either \u2018generating a series of evidenced-based recommendations\u2019,\nor acting more as information systems, leaving the end user (in this case, a farmer) to come to their own conclusions (Rose et al., 2016).\nNevertheless, research suggests the use of DSTs over the last ten years has by no-means been universal. A research survey in 2016 revealed that the use of DSTs in both the U.K. and other regions was \u2018limited\u2019 (Rose et al., 2016). This result was further supported by research conducted in 2019 by Michels, Bonke and Musshoff (Michels et al., 2020). This research identified a very high level of technology adoption from a survey of 207 German farmers, with 95% of those surveyed using a smartphone, yet found that adoption of phone-based crop-protection DSTs was only 71% (Michels et al., 2020).\nMoreover, the research by Michels et al attempted to identify the reasons why farmers in the survey chose or chose not to use the phone-based cropprotection DSTs and made some noteworthy findings. First, the analysis of farmer responses was applied to the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology, which considers four key behavioural factors that include performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social norm and facilitating conditions (Venkatesh et al., 2003). In summary, performance expectancy is the level of improvement a user believes an app has made to their task performance, while effort expectancy is essentially the \u2018ease of use\u2019 a person feels using an app. Social norm is the level a user feels they should be expected to be using such a app, while facilitating conditions is the user\u2019s perception of how well existing technology supports the app\u2019s key functions (Michels et al., 2020; Venkatesh et al., 2003).\nGiven a survey asking which functions were considered the most useful in apps related to crop-protection, 77% of 198 respondants chose \u2018weather information\u2019 and 83% said they were already using it. The authors made the caveat that many smartphones already include weather information, but did not specify what type of weather information was used by farmers and whether a built-in app featured such information. Nevertheless, weather information was perceived by respondents of the survey as the most useful of features (Michels et al., 2020). The second point was in considering facilitating conditions, the authors noted the importance of the smartphone being capable of installing the app (Michels et al., 2020). For example, an iOS (Apple) app will not install on Android devices and vice versa. Importantly, our proposed CLOWD framework bypasses this issue by being a web-based app that requires no additional software installation.\nThe third point from this research was the importance of a DST (in particular, the user interface) being easy to use (Michels et al., 2020). This point\nis supported also by Zhai et al. (2020) where one of the key challenges in the development of \u2018Agriculture 4.0\u2019 DSTs was simplifying the DST\u2019s graphical user interface. It is in light of these findings that our proposed CLOWD framework exists as two separate platforms - one for smartphones and one for PCs/laptops, each with a completely separate and targeted user interface. This paper will now discuss this framework in the following section."

            "text": "The proposed CLOWD framework, shown in Fig. 1, is divided into two sections. First, the user interface or \u2018front end\u2019 controls delivery of information to the user via their web browser through the React open-source user interface platform. It also directly accesses location and soil map data from various CC-BY-4.0-licensed sources discussed in Section 3.4. Second, the web server-side or \u2018back end\u2019 section interacts with, as well as collects the required data from, the Queensland Department of Environment and Science \u2018SILO\u2019 server. This section is built on the Node.js open-source JavaScript server platform. In all cases, data is retrieved through open-access application programming interfaces (APIs). This chapter will now describe these sections in more detail, including decisions taken for various design elements."

            "text": "The user interface design centres on the user selecting a location anywhere within Australia on a zoomable/clickable map and viewing the analysis of weather data as near to that location as data is available through a series of charts, each chart featuring one weather attribute. Thus, the goal is to keep the user interface as simple as possible to facilitate ease and speed of use.\nMoreover, to better facilitate its use on different screen sizes, two versions of the user interface have been developed - a six-charted version for large/high-resolution PC and laptop screens as shown in Fig. 2, along with a second single-chart screen version for smartphones, shown in Fig. 3. Thus, following research in Section 2, the purpose of designing separate user interfaces was to make use of the inherent advantages of each platform. For example, larger-dimensioned PC/laptop screens enable the use of six sideby-side charts to more quickly determine trends between weather attributes. The single-charted phone version incorporates left/right-swipe control for fast access between the various chart options on smaller screens, whilst maintaining readability.\nThese design choices were also made on the basis of previous research in human-computer interaction (HCI) that identified the relationship between functional complexity and interaction simplicity required in modern UI design (Miraz et al., 2021; Satzinger and Olfman, 1998). The methodology used in designing both interfaces is to maintain what is considered as \u2018internal consistency\u2019, which is the consistency of the interface across the application components. This can include consistency in placement and design, ensuring the user has a simple user-experience (UX). Research by Miniukovich et al. (2019) has more recently shown that usability (how easy a website is to use) is affected by readability (how easy it is to read). They identified a number of useful guidelines for improving the overall experience, including left-justified text, using font sizes greater than 12-point and the use of sans-serif style fonts. Where possible, these design guidelines have been implemented in the CLOWD user interface designs, to further reduce any barriers for users to benefit from these web applications.\nIn both versions, the charts are customisable, in terms of the data and weather attributes they show. Moreover, the map allows a choice of a street view, satellite image, soil type (NSW only) or estimated soil fertility (NSW only) of the area selected. All map options are coordinated such that they remain in lock-step as the map is moved and scaled.\nThe desire for a smooth and easy UX also led to the inclusion of a PDF (Portable Document File format) help/instruction manual to detail the CLOWD functionality. This appears inside a local PDF viewer on both versions. The importance of this delivery method is that it ensures the user always has the latest reference help document available as it is automatically downloaded and displayed upon pressing the \u2018Help\u2019 button."

To help mitigate this, each CLOWD chart incorporates a \u2018text\u2019 version automatically created through a programming technique called \u2018natural language generation\u2019 (NLG) (Reiter and Dale, 1997). In its simplest form, NLG contains a series of pre-coded natural-language sentences that are then populated with the appropriate data and delivered to the user\u2019s screen. More complex forms automatically alter the sentence structures based on the data values. The purpose of NLG in CLOWD is to provide an overview of the chart\u2019s key points and trends in a text form that can be read easily by those who may\nstruggle with understanding charts. The NLG functionality is coded into the user interface and does not require the CLOWD server to process it, helping to lower server costs. This feature can be seen in Fig. 4."

However, the PDF report can also be downloaded to the client device\u2019s local storage for further use or dissemination.\nThe smartphone version of the PDF report is similarly generated on the smartphone itself and is shown in Fig. 6. However, the choice of charts and accompanying NLG text is determined by the chart rotation list created by the user within the CLOWD settings page, as shown in Fig. 7.

It simplifies the task of interacting between data manipulation processes within the JavaScript programming language and linking the outcomes of those processes with on-screen controls and displays. As the user interface appears within a standard web browser, this is still coded in standard HTML (HyperText Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) languages. However, the additional analysis applied to the retrieved weather data in CLOWD is a combination of Node.js (retrieval), React (processing) and custom JavaScript functions developed for CLOWD, a number of which will be detailed in Section 4.\nNumerous additional libraries available via the Node.js Package Manager (NPM) are utilised within the React-powered user interface, including the Leaflet and React-leaflet map retrival/display modules.\nOn-device analysis reduces the processing load on the CLOWD server,\nbut does not appear to have a noticeably detrimental effect on client device performance, including recent smartphones. Previous research has shown that smartphones are fast approaching - and even exceeding - the processing performance levels of current-generation laptops (Yates and Islam, 2022)."

Thus, depending on the number of concurrent users, the level of performance required by the server can be expected to be more modest, again helping to lower system costs.\nThe CLOWD web server is developed using the Node.js open-source server environment. Node.js is cross-platform, enabling it to run on Windows, Linux and macOS computing platforms. Thus, the CLOWD framework is also cross-platform, with the prototype tested on an Amazon Web Services Linux-based server.

GDD is generally calculated daily and a crop accumulates GDD to provide an indication of the likely current phenology or growth stage. While the SILO project does not calculate GDD, it provides the minimum and maximum temperatures and can be calculated on the client device. The daily equation takes the form:\nGDD = [(Tmax + Tmin)/2]\u2212 Tbase (1)\nwhere Tmax is the maximum temperature over the 24 hour period, Tmin the minimum temperature and Tbase the crop-specific threshold temperature (McMaster and Wilhelm, 1997). However, as the work by McMaster and Wilhelm (1997) examines, there are two interpretations for how GDD is calculated, with regards to when the daily average temperature is below the base temperature, Tbase. The first is that if the result of the GDD calculation is less than zero, it is converted to zero (that is, it can never be negative). The second is if either Tmax or Tmin are less than Tbase, these individual components are set to Tbase. At present, the CLOWD framework implements the\nfirst interpretation. While daily-GDD data is useful, it is commonly considered a cumulative measure, thus it is calculated as:\nGDDsum = k\u2211\nn=1\nGDD(n) (2)\nwhere GDD(n) is the GDD measure for the n th day in the growing season of k days, such that n = [1..k]. Phenology stages can be tracked based on the crop achieving a particular level of cumulative GDD, with the count beginning on the sowing date (the date CLOWD users would set as start or zero-day)."

            "text": "The amount of water needed on a daily basis by a growing crop is dependent on the environmental vapour-pressure deficit (VPD) (Wang et al., 2004). Similarly to GDD, CLOWD calculates VPD using a series of equations (Zotarelli et al., 2010), based on raw data provided by the SILO project.\nThe first step is to calculate the average saturation vapour pressure, es(avg). This is done by calculating the saturation vapour pressure at both Tmin and Tmax via the equations:\nes(Tmin) = 0.6108exp( 17.27Tmin\nTmin + 237.3 ) (3)\nes(Tmax) = 0.6108exp( 17.27Tmax\nTmax + 237.3 ) (4)\nThe two values are then averaged:\nes(avg) = es(Tmax) + es(Tmin)\n2 (5)\nAt this point, the actual vapour pressure (avp) is derived as a function of relative humidity:\navp = [es(Tmin) \u00d7 (RHmax/100)] + [es(Tmax) \u00d7 (RHmin/100)]\n2 (6)\nwhere RHmax is the maximum relative humidity and RHmin, the minimum relative humidity, from SILO data. The assumption is also made here that the point of maximum vapour pressure occurs at the time of minimum relative\nhumidity and vice versa (Sadler and Evans, 1989) (SILO records relative humidity as percentage values, hence these values are divided by 100 to obtain a proportional factor).\nFinally, the vapour pressure deficit (VPD) is the difference between the average saturated vapour pressure and the actual vapour pressure:\nV PD = es(avg) \u2212 avp (7)\nThe CLOWD framework calculates VPD on-demand for each day on the client/user device before it is charted as required. A JavaScript function called \u2018calculateVpd\u2019 has been created and incorporates the above equations to calculate VPD as follows:\nca lcu lateVpd ( tmax , tmin , rhmaxt , rhmint ) { var svpMax = 0.6108 \u2217 Math . exp ( (17 . 27 \u2217 tmax) / ( tmax + 237 .3 ) ) ; var svpMin = 0.6108 \u2217 Math . exp ( (17 . 27 \u2217 tmin ) / ( tmin + 237 .3 ) ) ; var avgSvp = (svpMax + svpMin ) / 2 . 0 ; var avp = ( ( svpMin \u2217 ( rhmaxt /100)) + (svpMax \u2217 ( rhmint /100)) ) / 2 . 0 ; r e turn avgSvp \u2212 avp ; }\nThis function takes in the parameters Tmax, Tmin, RHminT and RHmaxT retrieved from the SILO data and returns the calculated VPD value."

In Australia, it is generally recognised that night-time temperatures below 15\u25e6C can cause spikelet sterility during the microspore phenology stage in varieties of rice (Farrell et al., 2006) and affect head rice yield. However, this night-time temperature threshold varies not just between rice varieties but crop varieties also (Farrell et al., 2006). Thus, a method that delivers an automated and customisable alert to crop growers could prove valuable.\nThe CLOWD framework provides this alert system and is selectable by the user within the CLOWD settings page. An example is shown in Fig. 9. As the user selects a new location and in addition to the weather data for that location being downloaded from the SILO server, the preceding nine days are analysed for maximum and minimum temperature. If these temperatures are outside the threshold selected by the user (also chosen in the settings page), an alert pop-up window appears to notify the user that recent temperatures are outside the threshold and that additional crop care may be required. The threshold temperature setting is stored locally within the client device\u2019s web browser and activated as chosen by the alert settings option."

Rather, it is designed to enable the user to quickly identify weather patterns that may affect or explain certain crop outcomes. This section will now present an example of knowledge discovery achieved through CLOWD.\nDuring the 2021/22 rice growing season in southern New South Wales, it was noted that rice crops were maturing or reaching the \u2018harvest\u2019 stage later than expected. One of the key growth parameters that affects the timing of the various rice phenology stages is vapour pressure deficit (VPD). A high VPD is seen to accelerate plant development by pulling nutrient-containing water through the plant, aiding that development, whereas a low VPD slows down that development process (Noh and Lee, 2022). Moreover, it has been reported that lower relative humidity and higher VPD can lead to higher head rice yield (Zhao and Fitzgerald, 2013).\nAs noted in Section 4.2, CLOWD calculates its own VPD analysis, allowing comparison of the current growing season against any one of the previous five seasons or the five as an average. Using the smartphone version\nof CLOWD and the framework\u2019s \u2018difference\u2019 feature, it was seen that at the chosen southern New South Wales location, the VPD was below the five-year average for almost the entirety of a six-week period between panicle initiation and grain maturity. This can be seen in Fig. 10. While VPD may not have been the only cause for late maturation, the fact this below-average period occurred is noteworthy nonetheless.\nThe pictured view in Fig. 10 was achieved by selecting the map location, swiping to the VPD chart and switching on the \u2018difference\u2019 mode to show the chart data-value differences between the current season and the previous five-year average (the default comparison setting)."

Further research is also being conducted to expand the CLOWD framework to include weather forecasting, allowing the addition of weather warnings, depending on the location and the warning-temperature settings selected.\nWhile the initial version of CLOWD is designed for Australia, the potential to transfer the framework to other geographic locations has been tested, with a working-prototype built around freely-accessible data made available by the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). This prototype, shown in Fig. 11, provides current weather conditions and a seven-day forecast (with percentage rain probability) for any location in the United States by clicking on the left-side map.

With these findings in\nmind, the proposed Combined Location Online Weather Data or \u2018CLOWD\u2019 platform provides an easy-to-use method that is accessible from many computing devices and requires only a web browser. It features device-specific UIs and incorporates natural language generation (NLG) methods to simplify the understanding of the individual weather charts CLOWD provides. It is currently available as two separate prototypes - https://clowd.csu.edu.au for desktop/laptop computers, https://clowds.csu.edu.au for iOS and Android smartphones. While CLOWD was designed with Australian data in mind, a prototype implementation using U.S. weather data shows its potential for transfer to other locations, provided the required data is freely available.\nStatements and Declarations\nThis work was supported in part by funding from the Food Agility Cooperative Research Centre (CRC), funded under the Australian Commonwealth Government Co-operative Research Centre program, and in part by Charles Sturt University, AgriFutures Australia and Ricegrowers Ltd.
