    "abstractText": "Background: It is currently considered that early initiation of nasal continuous positive airway pressure, using a less invasive exogenous surfactant administration and avoiding mechanical ventilation as much as possible to minimize lung damage, may reduce mortality and/or the risk of morbidities in preterm infants. The aim of our study was to quantify our experience and compare different strategies of surfactant administration, to investigate which method is associated with less morbidity. Materials and Methods: A total of 135 preterm infants with early rescue surfactant administration for respiratory distress syndrome were included in the study. The infants were treated in an academic, Level III Neonatal Intensive Care Unit over a 3-year period between 1 December 2018 and 1 December 2021. Patients were separated into three groups: those with standard surfactant administration; those with Less Invasive Surfactant Administration\u2014LISA; and those with Intubation Surfactant Administration Extubation\u2014INSURE. As a primary outcome, we followed the need for intubation and mechanical ventilation within 72 h, while the secondary outcomes were major neonatal morbidities and death before discharge. Results: The surfactant administration method was significantly associated with the need for mechanical ventilation within 72 h after the procedure (p < 0.001). LISA group infants needed less MV (OR = 0.538, p = 0.019) than INSURE group infants. We found less morbidities (OR = 0.492, p = 0.015) and deaths before discharge (OR = 0.640, p = 0.035) in the LISA group compared with the INSURE group. The analysis of morbidities found in infants who were given the surfactant by the LISA method compared with the INSURE method showed lower incidence of pneumothorax (3.9% vs. 8.8%), intraventricular hemorrhage (17.3% vs. 23.5%), intraventricular hemorrhage grade 3 and 4 (3.9% vs. 5.9%), sepsis/probable sepsis (11.5% vs. 17.7%) retinopathy of prematurity (16.7% vs. 26.7%) and deaths (3.9% vs. 5.9%). There were no significant differences between groups in frequencies of bronchopulmonary dysplasia, necrotizing enterocolitis and patent ductus arteriosus. Conclusions: Less invasive surfactant administration methods seem to have advantages regarding early need for mechanical ventilation, decreasing morbidities and death rate. In our opinion, the LISA procedure may be a good choice in spontaneously breathing infants regardless of gestational age.",

            "text": "Once the etiology of respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) was discovered, exogenous surfactant administration became the most effective evidence-based therapy for RDS in preterm infants [1]. Despite the benefits of surfactant administration, complications may also occur following this procedure depending on the administration method that is used. Occasionally, endotracheal intubation may cause hypoxia, bradycardia or respiratory tract\nHealthcare 2023, 11, 439. https://doi.org/10.3390/healthcare11030439 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/healthcare\nHealthcare 2023, 11, 439 2 of 14\ntrauma [2,3]. Mechanical ventilation (MV) may also cause lung damage which can lead to or worsen bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) [4]. If in the past the \u201ctraditional\u201d method of surfactant administration through the endotracheal tube (ETT) by intubation followed by MV was used exclusively, now the INSURE technique (INtubation-SURfactant administrationExtubation) is widely promoted, with current trends opting to avoid intubation. It is currently considered that supporting transition rather than resuscitation, using a less invasive exogenous surfactant administration protocol (LISA), avoiding MV as much as possible to minimize mechanical lung damage and early initiation of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (nCPAP), may reduce mortality and/or the risk of early complications (e.g., air leaks, intraventricular hemorrhage) and/or late complications (e.g., BPD) [5,6]. To avoid the negative effects of intubation and MV, less invasive procedures of surfactant replacement with thin catheters (feeding tubes or vascular catheters) have been in use in our unit in the last 7 years, in addition to the traditional and INSURE procedures. Therefore, the aim of our study was to quantify our experience, to compare different strategies of surfactant administration and to investigate which method of surfactant administration is associated with less morbidity. The primary outcome was the need for endotracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation within seventy-two hours after procedure. The secondary outcomes were complications of RDS and death before discharge."

            "text": "Over the study period, a total of 135 preterm infants with early rescue surfactant administration (in the first 2 h of life) for RDS were eligible for inclusion in the study. The infants were treated in an academic, Level III (regional) Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU), over a 3-year period between 1 December 2018 and 1 December 2021. The study was approved by the ethics committee of County Emergency Hospital of Targu Mures (35517/11.2018). Written informed consent was obtained from parents. The inclusion criteria in the study were: infants born in less than 32 weeks of gestational age (GA) (22/(0/7), to 31/(6/7) weeks of GA, with an estimation made on the bases of the modified Ballard score [7]) for the early rescue surfactant administration for RDS. We enrolled only the infants who were born in our neonatology department. Exclusion criteria from the study were: preterm infants born in less than 32 weeks of GA with congenital malformations (cyanotic heart disease, diaphragmatic hernia), chromosomal abnormalities or congenital infection, infants who received surfactant after two hours of life and infants born outside of our unit. The preterm infants were divided into three study groups according to the method of surfactant administration. The method of surfactant administration was set up according to the department\u2019s protocols. Thus, 33 infants received the surfactant by the standard method and 102 infants should have received the surfactant by the INSURE and LISA methods. The selection of patients for the INSURE or LISA methods was decided by randomization (1:2 ratio; 34 vs. 68). The patient randomization was performed at birth. We used the sealed envelopes method and randomization was performed by an independent blinded study nurse. In turn, 16 infants with spontaneous breathing at birth who should have received surfactant by the LISA method\u2014subsequently, in the first two hours of life\u2014presented clinical worsening (severe apnea with cyanosis, shallow breathing/severe work of breathing, hemodynamic instability) (Figure 1). Thus, they needed intubation and received surfactant by the standard method. Finally, 49 infants received surfactant by the standard method (standard group), 34 infants received surfactant by the INSURE method (INSURE group), and 52 infants received surfactant by the LISA method (LISA group) (Figure 1).\nHealthcare 2023, 11, 439 3 of 14\nHealthcare 2023, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 14\nstandard method (standard group), 34 infants received surfactant by the INSURE method (INSURE group), and 52 infants received surfactant by the LISA method (LISA group) (Figure 1).\nFigure 1. Flow chart for study groups.\n2.2. Study Intervention Along with the strict application of a resuscitation algorithm for preterm infants [2], depending on their condition at birth, spontaneously breathing infants were given a minimum 5 min alveolar recruitment with a T-piece resuscitator (Neopuff infant resuscitator; Fisher & Paykel Healthcare, Inc., Auckland, New Zealand). Positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) was set at 5 cmH2O. An amount of 100 to 200 mg/kg surfactant (poractant alpha, Curosurf, Chiesi Pharmaceuticals, Parma, Italy) was used in all patients. Intravenous Caffeine citrate (Peyona, Chiesi Farmaceutici SpA) was administered with a loading dose of 20 mg/kg before the INSURE and LISA procedures and continued with a maintenance dose of 5 mg/kg per day. Patients without spontaneous breathing at birth and/or bradycardia who needed intubation in the delivery room for resuscitation or those with severe respiratory distress with desaturations below target saturation for a given postnatal age detected by pulse oximetry received surfactant by the standard method through the endotracheal tube (ETT) at doses of at least 100 mg/kg (100\u2013200 mg/kg), followed by MV. The ETT position was evaluated by auscultation of the chest and/or X-ray. Mechanical ventilation was performed following the department\u2019s protocol, with weaning from MV as soon as possible (FiO2 of less than 0.3 and mean airway pressure of less than 10 cm H2O). Spontaneously breathing preterm infants with RDS received surfactant via either the INSURE or LISA method. INSURE was defined as transient intubation for surfactant administration through the ETT without sedatives and premedication, followed by immediate extubation after 1\u2013 2 min of positive pressure ventilation with a self-inflating bag, followed by nCPAP/noninvasive intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV). The surfactant was given in a dose of 200 mg/Kg within 1\u20133 min in small boluses under the continuous monitoring of heart rate and saturations by pulse oximetry. INSURE failure was defined as the need for MV within seventy-two hours after surfactant treatment. The criteria for intubation and initiating MV post-INSURE were the requirements of FiO2 > 0.4 to maintain O2 saturation above 90% or persistent apnea and/or increased respiratory distress. LISA was defined as surfactant administration while the infant is breathing on nCPAP, using a 5\u20136 Fr. feeding tube to pass into the trachea through the vocal cords 1\u20132\nFigure 1.

LISA failure was defined as need for MV within seventy-two hours after surfactant treatment. The criteria of intubation and MV were the same as in INSURE group. RDS is usually defined as respiratory distress appearing within the first 24 h of life, with complete, sustained, and prompt response to surfactant, lung recruitment, or both (additional non-mandatory criteria are lung imaging supporting the diagnosis, lamellar body counts \u2264 30,000/mm3, or both) [8]. RDS was diagnosed based on clinical criteria (dyspnea, tachypnea, progressive grunting, retractions and cyanosis), supplemental oxygen requirements (fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO2) more than 0.30 to maintain O2 saturation in the range of 88\u201394%), [5,9] radiologic evidence of RDS in chest X-rays, and/or altered blood gases tests (respiratory acidosis with pH less than 7.2 and PCO2 more than 65 mmHg). The severity (mild/moderate/severe) of RDS was defined according to the clinical classification and the Silverman Scoring System (score 0\u20133: mild; score 4\u20136: moderate; and score < 6: severe respiratory distress). Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) was defined as oxygen requirement at 36 weeks post-menstrual age [8\u201310].\nNecrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) was defined by using the Bell classification [11]. Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) was defined and graded according to Papile et al. [12]\nCranial ultrasounds were performed on day 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, 14 and 21 for all patients. The diagnosis of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) was based on the clinical and echocardiographic parameters [10\u201313]. Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) was defined using the standard classification [14]. Neonatal sepsis was defined as the presence of clinical signs and symptoms of sepsis with the isolation of pathogens from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, and urine from birth to 28 days of life. Probable sepsis was defined as the presence of the clinical picture of sepsis, without growth of any pathogen from blood, cerebrospinal fluid, or urine but with modified inflammatory and hematological markers.\nMortality was defined as death before discharge. Infant Flow SiPAP (Viasys Healthcare, Palm Springs, CA, USA) and Medin (Medical\nInnovations GmbH, Lindbergh Strasse, Puchheim, Germany) with binasal prongs were used to provide nCPAP. PEEP levels ranged between 5 and 8 cm H2O and FiO2 was adjusted to keep oxygen saturation of 90\u201395%. Leoni plus (L\u00f6wenstein Medical GmbH & Co. KG, Arzbacher,56130 Bad Ems, Germany) and Babylog 8000 plus (Drager, Germany) ventilators were used for MV. The rescue MV modes for post-INSURE or post-LISA respiratory failure were time cycled pressure limited conventional ventilation (Synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) \u00b1 Pressure support (PS)) and high frequency oscillatory ventilation (HFOV)."

For qualitative variables, we analyzed frequencies (absolute and relative %) and performed comparisons between groups based on the results of non-parametric tests (Pearson Chi-square). The association of the surfactant administration method with the clinical course of preterm infants was assessed based on the odd ratio (OR) resulting from a univariate logistic regression. The Kaplan\u2013Meier method was used to evaluate overall survival (OS), and the Log-Rank test was used to make comparisons.

Infants who received the surfactant by LISA (1043.8 g \u00b1 335.9) and INSURE (1095.3 g \u00b1 272.4) had significantly higher BW (p = 0.0002) compared to the BW of those who were given the surfactant by the standard method (Table 1). The standard group also presented with lower Apgar scores and a higher need of resuscitation. Significant desaturation, surfactant reflux, bradycardia and apnea effects during the procedure were observed in 21.15% of infants who received the surfactant by the LISA method and in 20.54% of infants from the INSURE group. The duration of MV needed after the procedure was significantly shorter (Student\u2019s t-test Test, p = 0.0103) in the case of the LISA group (89.2 h \u00b1 33.9) compared to the INSURE group (143.8 h \u00b1 54.5). The method of surfactant administration was significantly associated with the presence of major neonatal morbidities (p = 0.0168). In the LISA group, 61.5% of these infants had morbidities and in the INSURE group they had 76.5% (Table 1).

            "text": "We analyzed the association between GA, the need for subsequent MV and the major neonatal morbidities depending on the method of surfactant administration (Table 4). Thus, for the LISA method the analysis showed a significant association between the need for MV (failure of LISA) within 72 h after the procedure and GA (p = 0.0133). Within the same group, the need for MV was significantly more common for infants with a GA of less than 25 weeks (80%) and between 25 and 29 weeks (22.2%). In the case of surfactant administration by the INSURE method, the frequency of cases that needed MV within 72 h after procedure did not show significant differences depending on GA (p = 0.9824). Thus, we can appreciate that failure of the INSURE method is not significantly associated with the infant\u2019s GA (Table 4). Re-administration of the surfactant was significantly associated (p < 0.01) with a GA over 26 weeks regardless of the method of administration. Therefore, it was significantly more common to repeat the surfactant dose in infants with a GA of 30\u201332 weeks included from the standard group (60%). Regarding the LISA method, a second dose of the surfactant was needed in 11.1% of infants with a GA between 26 and 29 weeks. In the INSURE group, it was necessary to repeat the surfactant dose for approximately 20% of the infants with a GA between 26 and 32 weeks (Table 4). The presence of major neonatal morbidities was significantly associated with low a GA (22\u201325 weeks) in the case of both LISA (80%) and INSURE (100%). It was noted that, in the standard group, the frequency of morbidities had significantly increased regardless of GA. The occurrence of pneumothorax was significantly higher (p = 0.0364) in infants with a GA of 30\u201332 weeks with surfactant administration by the standard method (40%). The frequency of pneumothorax occurrence was lower in the LISA group (5.6%, GA: 26\u201329 weeks), while 20.5% of the infants in the INSURE group with a GA over 26 weeks experienced a pneumothorax. BPD had a high frequency in infants who received the surfactant by the standard method, regardless of their GA. In both the LISA (40%) and INSURE (80%) groups, BPD was significantly more common in infants with a GA of 22\u201326 weeks (Table 4). The frequency of cases of severe IVH was significantly increased (p = 0.0284) for a GA between 22 and 29 weeks. It is noted that IVH grade 3 and 4 was present in the LISA group only in infants with a low GA (22\u201325 weeks), while in the INSURE group there was a small number (insignificant) of cases with GA\u2019s between 26 and 32 weeks (Table 4). The presence of sepsis/probable sepsis was significantly associated with the low GA of infants in the INSURE group (p = 0.0151) and the standard group (p = 0.0028), but no significant association with the GA was found in the case of LISA (p = 0.8305) (Table 4). The outcome of the preterm infants was not significantly associated with GA in the INSURE group (p = 0.1566). In LISA group (40%\u2014GA: 22\u201325 weeks) and standard group (62.9%\u2014GA: 22\u201325 weeks), the frequency of deaths was significantly higher in very preterm infants (Table 4).\nHealthcare 2023, 11, 439 8 of 14\nLISA: Less Invasive Surfactant Administration; INSURE: INtubation-SURfactant administration-Extubation; n: number; GA: gestational age; MV: mechanical ventilation; BPD: bronchopulmonary dysplasia; IVH: intraventricular hemorrhage; PVL: periventricular leukomalacia; PDA: patent ductus arteriosus; NICU: Neonatal Intensive Care Unit; IQR: interquartile range; \u2021 Pearson Chi-square test; * Marked effects are significant at p < 0.05.\nHealthcare 2023, 11, 439 9 of 14"

The major goal for neonatologists has become to limit the incidence and severity of complications of prematurity (e.g., RDS, BPD, IVH, PVL, NEC and ROP), especially the disabling ones that could impact overall quality of life [14,15]. By far, RDS is one of the major causes of neonatal mortality and morbidity in preterm infants [16,17]. For a long time, the standard approach of RDS was surfactant therapy during intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV). Thus, administration of surfactant became one of the most common procedures performed in very preterm infants. As MV has been shown to be a risk factor for BPD due to airway and lung injury (barotrauma/volumtrauma/atelectrauma) produced, even in the case of a brief period of ventilation, different ventilation strategies have been developed to address this issue over time [18\u201322]. In order to decrease the need for intubation and MV, various noninvasive ventilation strategies have been widely introduced (e.g., CPAP, SIPPV and high-flow nasal cannula) [23\u201328]. Looking at the current recommendations of the European Consensus Guidelines on the Management of Respiratory Distress Syndrome\u2014 2019 Update, CPAP has been widely recommended to stabilize preterm infants in the delivery room and as a respiratory support before and after surfactant replacement. Hence, nCPAP is slowly replacing the MV and becoming the new standard of care. Current recommendations are to administer surfactant as early rescue therapy in the first two hours after birth, but only if respiratory distress is present [3,29]. There are still controversies about the optimal method of surfactant administration. Although the INSURE method has been routinely used since the 1990s, it involves short-term endotracheal intubation followed by a brief period of bag and mask ventilation or MV. Additionally, the iatrogenic risks of intubation are well known and, consequently, this widespread method of surfactant administration was gradually replaced by various techniques that avoided intubation per se. The terminology of the techniques differs (e.g., LISA\u2014less invasive surfactant administration; MIST\u2014minimally invasive surfactant therapy), but the principle is the same, respectively, the replacement of ETT with a smaller dimension device (e.g., feeding tube, umbilical catheter, Angio catheter, LISA Cath, Neo fact, Surf Cath). It is important to\nHealthcare 2023, 11, 439 11 of 14\nmention that all these methods can be utilized only in infants presenting with spontaneous breathing. There is still controversy in the literature regarding the type of catheter and the necessity of use of the Magill guide forceps or premedication (Atropine\u2014to reduce oropharyngeal secretions and vagal reflex, analgesia with Fentanyl). Additionally, there are several methods of surfactant administration using feeding tubes (Cologne method, Take Care method, SONSURE method) or 16 g Angio catheters (Hobart method), which have been described. Noninvasive surfactant administration has been the subject of many studies in recent years (e.g., LISA vs. INSURE, INSURE vs. the standard method, LISA vs. the standard method) [30\u201335]. In our country, our NICU was the first to use the LISA method of surfactant replacement as a first-line technique. Our method of surfactant administration differs from other methods described by using low-cost devices available in all facilities and totally avoiding sedation, premedication and supplemental forceps, thus, minimizing invasivity. In the present study, we compared three different strategies of surfactant administration: the standard method via endotracheal intubation, followed by MV and two methods of delivering surfactant in a gentler way with LISA (with feeding tube) and INSURE, followed by non-invasive ventilation. Regarding the standard group, the average GA and BW of the infants who received the surfactant was significantly (p < 0.00; p = 0.0002, respectively) lower compared to the GA and BW of infants who were given surfactant by LISA or INSURE. The standard method was also associated with significantly lower Apgar scores (p < 0.001), a higher need of resuscitation, repeated surfactant doses and longer mean times of MV, probably due to lower a GA that needed more support in all. Regarding the primary outcome of the present study, the requirement for endotracheal intubation and MV within seventy-two hours after the procedure was significantly associated with the method of the surfactant administration. Comparing LISA with INSURE, we found that the need for MV was significantly lower in the LISA group (25% vs. 38.2%, respectively), while the mean times of MV was significantly shorter in the LISA group (89.2 h \u00b1 33.9 vs. 143.8 h \u00b1 54.5, respectively) as compared with the INSURE group. LISA group infants had a lesser need for MV (OR = 0.538; 95% CI: 0.212 to 0.730, p = 0.019) and repeated doses of surfactant (OR = 0.389; 95% CI: 0.101 to 0.894, p = 0.017) than the INSURE group infants. Previous reports have shown similar results. A study conducted by G\u00f6pel et al. included 1103 infants born under 32 weeks of gestation and treated with LISA at 37 centers in Germany, showing that LISA was associated with lower rates of MV (41% versus 62%, p < 0.001) [36]. Krajewski et al. in a study involving 26 preterm infants with RDS receiving surfactant via a thin catheter reported a significant reduction in the need for MV (19.2% vs. 65%, p < 0.05) compared to the INSURE technique [37]. Two meta-analyses also showed a significant reduction in the need for MV within the first 72 h, and a reduction in the duration of MV in the LISA group compared with INSURE [6,38]. On the contrary, Aguar et al. in a study of 44 preterm infants with RDS receiving surfactant via a gastric tube reported no significant difference in the need for mechanical MV (25% vs. 33%, p = 0.44) and the duration of required MV (115 h vs. 150 h, p > 0.05) between the LISA and INSURE methods of delivering surfactant [31]. Regarding the secondary outcomes of the present study, we found less morbidities (OR = 0.492; 95% CI: 0.187 to 0.892; p = 0.015) and deaths before discharge (OR = 0.640; 95% CI: 0.386 to 0.774; p = 0.035) in the LISA group compared with the INSURE group. We also found a significant association of the standard method of surfactant administration with major neonatal morbidities (Pneumothorax, IVH, severe IVH, PVL, ventriculomegaly, ROP, sepsis/probable sepsis), deaths and the length of stay in neonatal intensive care. The analysis of morbidities found in infants who were given surfactant by the LISA method compared with the INSURE method showed lower incidence of Pneumothorax (3.9% vs. 8.8%), IVH (17.3% vs. 23.5%), IVH grade 3 and 4 (3.9% vs. 5.9%), ventriculomegaly (0% vs. 8.8%), sepsis/probable sepsis (11.5% vs. 17.7%), ROP (16.7% vs. 26.7%) and deaths (3.9% vs. 5.9%). There were no significant differences between groups in the frequencies of cases of BPD, NEC, PDA and length of stay in NICU. Kribs [39] compared the outcomes\nHealthcare 2023, 11, 439 12 of 14\nof the LISA method applied in infants born under 31 weeks of gestation with those of standard surfactant therapy in the same category of infants. The results showed the LISA group had a significant reduction in the need for MV within the first 72 h (29% vs. 53%, respectively; p < 0.001) and a decrease in BPD incidence (10.9% vs. 17.5%, respectively; p = 0.004). Another study involving LISA via thin catheter vs. INSURE proved significant reductions in BPD (15.4% vs. 40%, p < 0.05) and a lower incidence of other complications of prematurity, such as NEC (11.5% vs. 23.3%) and ROP (3.9% vs. 11.7%) [37]. LISA was associated with a reduced risk for adverse outcomes such as BPD (OR 0.55; 95% CI: 0.49\u20130.62, p < 0.001), IVH grade II-IV (OR 0.55; 95% CI: 0.48\u20130.64, p < 0.001), ROP (OR 0.62; 95% CI: 0.45\u20130.85, p < 0.001) and mortality (OR 0.66; 95% CI: 0.51\u20130.84, p < 0.001) in a study conducted by H\u00e4rtel et al. [40]. One of the main limitations of the study was the small number of cases included, which were studied according to per-protocol analysis."

Our method of surfactant administration differs from other methods described by the use of low-cost devices available in all facilities and the total avoidance of sedation, premedication and supplemental forceps, thus, minimizing invasivity. Concerning the best choice for surfactant administration under debate, our study underlines once more that LISA has no more complications than INSURE, has the benefit of minimal invasivity in surfactant replacement and has potential in improving preterm infant outcomes. LISA requires certain skills and experience to be safely administered, but it is a method that shows promising results in the treatment of RDS. LISA can be used until a totally non-invasive method of surfactant administering (possibly by nebulization) is developed.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, M.C., M.M. and M.S.; methodology, M.C., M.S., M.M. and E.M.; software, M.M.; validation, R.S., Z.G. and L.M.S.; formal analysis, M.C., M.S. and M.M.; investigation, M.C., E.M., Z.G. and M.S.; resources, M.M., R.S. and L.M.S.; data curation, M.M. and E.M.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, M.C., M.M., R.S. and M.S.; writing\u2014review and editing, M.C. and M.S.; visualization, M.M., E.M. and M.S.; supervision, M.C.
