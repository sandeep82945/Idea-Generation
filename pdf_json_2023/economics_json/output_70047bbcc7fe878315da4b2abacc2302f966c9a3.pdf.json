    "abstractText": "Unemployment insurance provides temporary cash benefits to eligible unemployedworkers. Benefits are sometimes extended by discretion during economic slumps. In a model that features temporary benefits and sequential job opportunities, a worker\u2019s reservation wages are studied when policymakers canmake discretionary extensions to benefits. Aworker\u2019s optimal labor-supply choice is characterized by a sequence of reservation wages that increases withweeks of remaining benefits. The possibility of an extension raises the entire sequence of reservation wages, meaning a worker is more selective when accepting job offers throughout their spell of unemployment. The welfare consequences of misperceiving the probability and length of an extension are investigated. Properties of the model can help policymakers interpret data on reservation wages, which may be important if extended benefits are used more often in response to economic slumps, virus pandemics, extreme heat, and natural disasters.",

            "text": "Each month millions of workers lose their jobs. Unemployed workers search for jobs by answering online ads, contacting employers, using the services of employment agencies, and asking friends and relatives about employment opportunities. Workers understand the the types and frequency of job offers they expect to receive. Depending on how long they are unemployed, workers are entitled to unemployment-insurance compensation, typically 26 weeks. Upon receiving a job offer, a worker has the option to reject the offer and continue their search or accept the job. A sequence of reservation wages describes optimal choices: any wage offer above the reservation level should be accepted. As more weeks of unemployment are endured and fewer weeks of unemployment insurance remain, the reservation wage will fall, indicating that workers are less selective as benefits expire. Less is known about optimal decisions, however, when policymakers can extend benefits by discretion.\nExtensions to UI benefits. In brief, here is the main issue: Unemployed workers are often entitled to claim 26 weeks of UI compensation. In periods of economic distress, policymakers sometimes extend the number of weeks an individual might claim UI compensation by discretion. When a worker misperceives the probability and length of an extension, what are the costs?\nI answer the question from a worker\u2019s perspective. Imagine that Sonia is unemployed and submitting her resume to online ads. Each week Sonia receives a job offer that she can accept or reject. Meanwhile, her unemployment compensation benefits are expiring. Between job offers, however, there is a chance that benefits are extended. An extension would allow Sonia to claim additional weeks of UI compensation. If an extension is likely, then Sonia can reject low-wage offers, knowing that her search will likely be supported by extended UI compensation. Sonia\u2019s reservation wage increases. Sonia, though, might not know the true probability that benefits are extended and the length of the extension.\nI am interested in Sonia\u2019s welfare costs when she misperceives the probability and length of an extension. If Sonia believes an extension is unlikely to happen, so the true probability of an extension is higher than what Sonia believes, then Sonia risks accepting job offers she would like to reject. In this scenario, if Sonia knew the true probability, then on average she would like to spend more time searching in order to find a higher-paying job. To understand these costs, I develop a formal dynamic model of sequential job search with expiring UI benefits, which allows for the possibility that benefits are extended. Burdett (1979) studied expiring benefits in McCall\u2019s (1970) environment of sequential job search. I add to this environment the possibility that benefits are extended. I show how perceptions about the possibility of an extension affect reservation wages, which determine a worker\u2019s job-acceptance criteria.\nThe decision-making environment I consider captures some features of UI extensions made during and after the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, extensions to UI compensation benefits created by Congress during the Great Recession under the Emergency Unemployment Compensation program expired three times and each time Congress had to reauthorize the program to the previous expiration date (Rothstein, 2011). In fact, temporary additional UI benefits have been created by Congress 9 times: in 1958, 1961, 1971, 1974, 1982, 1991, 2002, 2008, and 2020. These policies have extended the number of weeks a worker could claim UI compensation anywhere from 6 to 53 weeks (Whittaker and Isaacs, 2022). As I document in\n2\nsection 2, there is much uncertainty and risk from a worker\u2019s perspective when extensions are made by discretion.\nBecause discretionary extensions made to UI compensation benefits are endogenous by design, making econometric work challenging, there is scope for investigating a theoretical model. I present the model in sections 3 and 4. Section 5 presents a numerical example. The exercise is not meant to be definitive. Instead, it is meant to demonstrate the theoretical properties established in sections 3 and 4. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the welfare calculations imply small costs to misperceiving benefit extensions. Finding small costs is discussed in the context of the literature in section 6. Section 7 concludes."

Benefits are automatically extended through the Extended Benefits (EB) program of the UI system. The UI system is a joint federal\u2013state partnership with essentially 53 different systems (the 50 states, Puerto Rico, the District of Columbia, and the US Virgin Islands). Regular UI in most states provides 26 weeks of UI compensation. The EB program extends the number of weeks a worker can claim UI compensation by 13 or 20 weeks when state-specific unemployment-rate triggers are reached. But \u201cin practice, the required EB trigger is set to such a high level of unemployment that the majority of states do not trigger onto EB in most recessions\u201d (Whittaker and Isaacs, 2022, 1\u20132). In response, Congress often temporarily extends UI benefits like they recently did under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act (CARES Act) during the COVID-19 pandemic and the Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program during the Great Recession (Fujita, 2010). From a worker\u2019s perspective, both types of extensions involve uncertainty and risk: Automatic extensions require a forecast of unemployment-rate statistics and discretionary extensions require a forecast of legislative action.1\nDetails of the EUC program and CARES Act justify investigating the costs associated with misperceiving the probability and length of an extension. Section 2.1 considers a thought experiment about how difficult it was for a worker to perceive that they would be entitled to claim up to 99 weeks of UI benefits after the Great Recession. Section 2.2 shares an index of Google searches for \u201cunemployment benefits extension,\u201d which spikes around potential cutoffs to extended benefits after the COVID-19 pandemic. Both episodes document the significant uncertainty a worker must manage when making decisions about accepting job offers when benefits can be extended."

Chodorow-Reich and Coglianese (2019, 158, figure 2) show data on the number UI recipients who claim regular, EB, and emergency weeks created by temporary extension. Extended benefits are relied upon less frequently than emergency benefits.\n3\nCalifornia had been triggered on since February 22, 2009, so Vernon could expect to receive 26 regular weeks of UI coverage and 20 EB weeks for a total of 46 weeks\u2014as long as California did not trigger off its extended-benefits thresholds, requiring Vernon to forecast unemployment-rate statistics. After the 46 weeks, Vernon could reasonably expect to receive no temporary benefits because the EUC program was set to expire in late February 2010 (Rothstein, 2011, 150, table 1). Yet, around June 27, 2010, 25 weeks or so after Vernon became unemployed, California\u2019s EB program had triggered off and the federal EUC program had also expired.2\nWhat Vernon expected then is unknowable, but by July 25, 2010, the EB program had triggered on in California and the EUC program had been reauthorized. Vernon at that time could reasonably expect\u2014in addition to the 26 weeks of regular UI compensation just received\u201420 EB weeks plus 20 + 14 + 13 + 6 = 53 weeks of UI compensation under the 4 tiers of the reauthorized EUC program (where some of the compensation would be paid retroactively) (Rothstein, 2011, 153). In total, Vernon could have received up to 26+ 20+ 53 = 99 weeks of UI compensation. Yet, the 99 weeks belies the uncertainty and risk faced by Vernon.3\nVernon\u2019s predicament was pointed out by Kahn (2011) in the context of UI extensions in the Great Recession aftermath. After the EUC program was authorized in June 2008, temporary extensions were enacted and reauthorized by Congress in \u201cfits and starts\u201d (Rothstein, 2011, 149). \u201cFor much of the program\u2019s history, the expiration date was quite close. Indeed, on three occasions. . .Congress allowed the program to expire. Each time, Congress eventually reauthorized it retroactive to the previous expiration date\u201d (Rothstein, 2011, 150)."

Two CARES Act programs extended UI compensation benefits. The Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC) program provided additional weeks of federally funded benefits similar to the EUC program in the Great Recession. And the Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA) program expanded coverage to individuals who would be ineligible for UI benefits (the self-employed, independent contractors, gig-economy workers) and to individuals unemployed due to COVID19-related reasons. Both programs were reauthorized multiple times. Data on internet searches suggest that workers were concerned about access to extended benefits throughout 2020 and 2021.\nFigure 1 depicts a weekly index of Google searches for \u201cunemployment benefits extension.\u201d In early 2020, before the COVID-19 pandemic, the index was near zero.

The local peaks that follow have to dowith benefit extensions. In the week of December 27, 2020, the Continued Assistance Act was signed into law, which increased the maximum number of PEUC weeks from 13 to 24 and increased the maximum number of PUA weeks from 39 to 50. In the week of March 11, 2021, the American Rescue Plan increased the maximum number of PEUCweeks to 53 and increased the maximum number of PUAweeks to 79. Both the PEUC and PUA programswere extended through September 4, 2021, when temporary UI programs ended (Spadafora, 2023, 4). As documented in figure 1, each of these policy milestones coincided with increased Google searches for \u201cunemployment benefits extension.\u201d5\n4As of August 11, 2023, theMarch 13 date is reported on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s COVID19 timeline.\n5In addition, workers in 18 states faced a cutoff in compensation-benefit generosity when their states opted out of the FPUC and PUA progams in June 2021 before the programs were set to expire in September 2021, citing laborsupply issues (Holzer, Hubbard, and Strain, 2021). There are many other parts to the UI system that are beyond the scope of this paper. Whittaker and Isaacs (2022, 2014) and Spadafora (2023) provide excellent, detailed coverage of the UI system.

            "text": "Before turning to a decision-making environment where UI benefits can be extended, I start with a canonical model of sequential search. In the environment, a worker is entitled to \ud835\udc41 periods of UI compensation benefits. The worker searches for a job, taking market conditions as given. Market conditions are summarized by a wage-offer distribution. The worker receives a wage offer each period. Upon receiving an offer, the worker decides whether to accept the job or continue search. After \ud835\udc41 rejected job offers, the worker will no longer receive UI benefits.\nThis sequential-search problem, where remaining periods of UI compensation is a state variable, was studied by Burdett (1979). The optimal solution is a sequence of reservation wages that is increasing in the remaining periods of UI compensation. To maximize their expected income, a worker rejects any job offer with a wage below the reservation wage and accepts any job offer with awage above the reservationwage. Burdett (1979) proves the result using Bellman equations for employment and unemployment. In contrast, I provide a proof that expresses the model in terms of reservation wages, using techniques described by Rogerson, Shimer, and Wright (2005). I believe the optimal policy is more transparent. In addition, my proof provides an algorithm for directly computing the sequence of reservation wages.\nKrueger and Mueller (2016), using a model discussed by Mortensen (1977), consider a similar environment\u2014where workers can claim UI compensation for a finite number of weeks\u2014but allow for jobs to end. A worker who holds a job that does not last 6 months does not qualify for UI compensation. The added complexity, however, requires them to rely on numerical results. Unlike the environment I study, they do not allow for the possibility that benefits are extended. Boar and Mongey (2020) consider a related problem where workers consider expiring additional benefits added by the CARES Act. They are interested in whether workers will reject returnto-work offers in order to claim the $600-per-week additional UI benefit. Benefits expire with a fixed probability, though, so optimal decisions are not characterized by a sequence of reservation wages, a feature that is essential to the search environment I consider. Thus, the results of Krueger and Mueller (2016) and Boar and Mongey (2020) are complementary to my analysis.\nThe environment considered in this section is generalized in section 4, where extensions to UI benefits are considered. Additional references to the literature on unemployment insurance are shared in appendix A."

The value of nonwork includes unemployment-insurance compensation, the value of leisure, and the value of home production. Justification for modeling a risk-neutral worker with no savings includes the fact that \u201ca majority of unemployed workers have only a trivial amount of savings\u201d and\n6\n\u201cextending the model to include savings is an unnecessary complication for a large portion of the unemployed\u201d (Krueger and Mueller, 2016, 146\u2013147).6\nA job is fully characterized by the wage the job pays, but a worker has imperfect information about job possibilities. The imperfect information is characterized as a distribution of possible wage offers.

If a worker accepts a wage offer, they keep the job forever. An accepted job entitles the worker to a wage payment each period.

Thus T is a contraction.

A worker is more selective when there is a single remaining week of UI benefits than when there are no remaining weeks, \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (1) > \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (0). And, using an induction argument, because T is increasing, \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (\ud835\udc5b) > \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (\ud835\udc5b \u2212 1) implies \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (\ud835\udc5b + 1) > \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (\ud835\udc5b). Proposition 1 summarizes these results and appendix C provides the details.\nProposition 1. Assume a risk-neutral, infinitely lived worker searching for a job. The worker perceives no possibility that benefits are extended. The worker is entitled to \ud835\udc41 periods of UI benefits and regularly receives wage offers from the known offer distribution \ud835\udc39 with support[ \ud835\udc64,\ud835\udc64 ] and mean \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc64 . A single independently and identically distributed offer is received each period. The solution to theworker\u2019s sequential-search problem is a sequence of reservationwages that increases in the number of remaining periods of UI compensation benefits:\n\ud835\udc64 > \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (\ud835\udc41 ) > \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 > \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (\ud835\udc5b + 1) > \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (\ud835\udc5b) > \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 > \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (0) > \ud835\udc64. (7)\nIn state \ud835\udc5b, the worker accepts any wage\ud835\udc64 \u2265 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (\ud835\udc5b). For offer distributions where\ud835\udc64 < (1 \u2212 \ud835\udefd) \ud835\udc67+ \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc64 , the reservation wages exist and are unique. The support of wages can extend to [0,\u221e).\nWhen the future means more to workers currently, then they are more selective throughout their entire unemployment spells. In other words, a higher \ud835\udefd shifts the entire sequence of reservation wages upward. Workers are also more selective throughout their unemployment spells when \ud835\udc67 or \ud835\udc50 is higher. A higher value of nonwork means they can reject some jobs they wouldn\u2019t have otherwise. Appendix G provides more details.\n8Appendix C considers the case where the support of wages is [ \ud835\udc64,\u221e ) . In that case, I establish that T contracts\nthrough direct verification, which requires more algebra.\n8"

From the worker\u2019s perspective, there is uncertainty over\n(i) whether benefits are extended and\n(ii) the length of the extension.\nI investigate theoretically how the the possibility of extendingUI benefits affects job-acceptance decisions. I allow workers to form a fixed belief about an extension\u2014summarized by two parameters for items (i) and (ii)\u2014and compute their welfare conditional on that belief. My formulation abstracts from how beliefs are formed and how beliefs are updated. While central to decisionmaking, there is no agreement on how to specify beliefs (Caplin and Leahy, 2019, provide a recent take). In addition, my formulation avoids specifying how legislators enact extensions. These features allow me to develop a formal, tractable dynamic model that investigates the costs of misperceiving the probability and length of an extension.\nThe economic environment is described in section 4.1.

Then benefits are extended, which occurs with probability \ud835\udeff .

There is no longer a chance of extension.\nThe extension of benefits rules out benefits being extended again. The one-time occurrence of an extension implies that, upon extension, the worker solves a standard McCall model that includes the remaining periods of compensation as a state variable. In other words, once benefits are extended, the worker solves the problem described in section 3.\nLike in the sequential-search model with finite benefits considered in section 3, preferences are the same as in (1). The value of a job is\ud835\udc4a (\ud835\udc64) = \ud835\udc64/(1 \u2212 \ud835\udefd). In this environment, I need to distinguish between the value of unemployment in the upper and lower halves of figure 2. In the upper half, there is no chance of an extension. The value of unemployment when there is no chance of extension is denoted by\ud835\udc48 . In the lower half of figure 2, there is a chance\u2014or a perceived chance\u2014that benefits will be extended. The value of unemployment in this case is denoted by \ud835\udc48 \ud835\udeff . Both\ud835\udc48 and\ud835\udc48 \ud835\udeff depend on the number of remaining periods of UI compensation.\nThe value of \ud835\udc48 corresponds to the basic model of job search in section 3. The value of \ud835\udc48 \ud835\udeff requires characterization. When there is a perceived chance that benefits can be extended, the value of unemployment is, for \ud835\udc5b \u2208 {1, . . . , \ud835\udc41 },\n\ud835\udc48 \ud835\udeff (\ud835\udc5b) = \ud835\udc67 + \ud835\udc50 + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udeff E [max {\ud835\udc48 (\ud835\udc5b \u2212 1 + \u0394) ,\ud835\udc4a (\ud835\udc64)}] + \ud835\udefd (1 \u2212 \ud835\udeff) E [ max { \ud835\udc48 \ud835\udeff (\ud835\udc5b \u2212 1) ,\ud835\udc4a (\ud835\udc64) }] .\n(8)\nThe first component of the expression on the right side, \ud835\udc67+\ud835\udc50 , corresponds to the value of nonwork plus the flow UI compensation benefit. The following period, discounted by \ud835\udefd , corresponds to choosing to accept or reject a job when benefits have or have not been extended, which occurs with probability \ud835\udeff and 1 \u2212 \ud835\udeff . Likewise,\n\ud835\udc48 \ud835\udeff (0) = \ud835\udc67 + \ud835\udefd { \ud835\udeff E [max {\ud835\udc48 (\u0394) ,\ud835\udc4a (\ud835\udc64)}] (1 \u2212 \ud835\udeff) E [ max { \ud835\udc48 \ud835\udeff (0) ,\ud835\udc4a (\ud835\udc64) }]} . (9)\nWhen there is a perceived chance that benefits will be extended, the reservation wage differs from the case when there is no chance. I need to distinguish between the two cases. The reserva-\n10\ntion wage when there is a chance of extension is denoted by \ud835\udc64\ud835\udeff \ud835\udc45 and the reservation wage upon an extension is denoted by\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 . Both depend on the remaining periods of UI benefits. Using the techniques in 3, the value of a job, and the expressions for \ud835\udc48 \ud835\udeff in (8) and (9), the reservation wages satisfy, for \ud835\udc5b \u2208 {1, . . . , \ud835\udc41 },\n\ud835\udc64\ud835\udeff\ud835\udc45 (\ud835\udc5b) = (\ud835\udc67 + \ud835\udc50) (1 \u2212 \ud835\udefd) + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udeff [\u222b \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (\ud835\udc5b\u22121+\u0394)\n\ud835\udc64\n\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (\ud835\udc5b \u2212 1 + \u0394) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64) + \u222b \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (\ud835\udc5b\u22121+\u0394) \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64) ]\n+ \ud835\udefd (1 \u2212 \ud835\udeff) [\u222b \ud835\udc64\ud835\udeff \ud835\udc45 (\ud835\udc5b\u22121)\n\ud835\udc64\n\ud835\udc64\ud835\udeff\ud835\udc45 (\ud835\udc51 \u2212 1) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64) + \u222b \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udeff \ud835\udc45 (\ud835\udc51\u22121) \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64) ] .\n(10)\nand, when \ud835\udc5b = 0, \ud835\udc64\ud835\udeff\ud835\udc45 (0) = \ud835\udc67 (1 \u2212 \ud835\udefd) + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udeff [\u222b \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (\u0394)\n\ud835\udc64\n\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (\u0394) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64) + \u222b \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (\u0394) \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64) ]\n+ \ud835\udefd (1 \u2212 \ud835\udeff) [\u222b \ud835\udc64\ud835\udeff \ud835\udc45 (0)\n0 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udeff\ud835\udc45 (0) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64) + \u222b \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udeff \ud835\udc45 (0) \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64) ] .\n(11)\nThe expressions in (10) and (11) can be interpreted as the benefit of search when an offer\ud835\udc64\ud835\udeff \ud835\udc45 is in hand.

(12)\nThe left side is the cost of searching another period when offer\ud835\udc64\ud835\udeff \ud835\udc45 (0) is available. The right side is the expected benefit. When benefits are extended, the worker gains the expected net benefit of adopting reservation wage \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (\u0394). Adopting \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (\u0394) as opposed to \ud835\udc64\ud835\udeff\ud835\udc45 (0) yields two values. First, a worker will reject wage offers below \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (\u0394), yielding net benefit \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (\u0394) \u2212 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udeff\ud835\udc45 (0) > 0.

This is summarized in proposition 2.\nProposition 2. Assume a risk-neutral, infinitely lived worker searching for a job. The worker is initially entitled to \ud835\udc41 periods of UI benefits and regularly receives wage offers from the known offer distribution \ud835\udc39 with support [ \ud835\udc64,\ud835\udc64 ] and mean \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc64 . A single independently and identically distributed offer is received each period. In addition, between each job offer, there is a chance that benefits are extended by \u0394 periods with probability \ud835\udeff .\nThe solution to the worker\u2019s sequential-search problem is a sequence of reservation wages that increases in the number of remaining periods of UI compensation benefits:\n\ud835\udc64 > \ud835\udc64\ud835\udeff\ud835\udc45 (\ud835\udc41 ) > \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 > \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udeff \ud835\udc45 (\ud835\udc5b + 1) > \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udeff \ud835\udc45 (\ud835\udc5b) > \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 > \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udeff \ud835\udc45 (0) > \ud835\udc64.

            "text": "As is often the case, a worker does not know whether benefits will be extended or the extension\u2019s length. Aworker\u2019s subjective beliefs about a future extension are summarized by two parameters: \ud835\udeff and \u0394. The parameter \ud835\udeff summarizes beliefs about the probability that benefits are extended. The parameter \u0394 summarizes beliefs about the length of an extension. Both \ud835\udeff and \u0394 affect search behavior in an intuitive way. Extending benefits through \ud835\udeff or \u0394 provides relief from earning only the flow benefit of nonwork. Which allows the worker to be more selective about the jobs they are willing to accept. This idea is summarized in proposition 3.\nProposition 3. Assume a worker searching for a job described in proposition 2. Each reservation wage \ud835\udc64\ud835\udeff\n\ud835\udc45 (\ud835\udc5b) is increasing in \ud835\udeff and \u0394. That is, the worker is more selective when accepting job\noffers for at least two reasons. First, the worker is more selective when they think there is a greater chance that benefits will be extended. Second, the worker is more selective when they think benefits will be extended by more periods.\n10Appendix E also shows that the support of wages can be extended to [0,\u221e).\n12\nAppendix F provides a detailed proof. Propositions 1, 2, and 3 are illustrated by figure 3, which shows sequences of reservation wages for different parameter values. The horizontal axis shows the remaining periods of UI compensation. As established, optimal choices imply a worker is less selective as benefits expire\u2014 all the sequences are increasing in remaining periods of UI compensation. The solid, dark-blue line depicts the sequence of reservation wages after an extension has occurred. Alternatively, because extensions are made only once, this sequence could be interpreted as the sequence of reservation wages when there is no chance of an extension.\nNote: The dark-blue line depicts the sequence of reservation wages once an extension has occurred. These reservation wages lie below the sequences of reservation wages when there is a chance of extension, meaning the worker is less selective when there is no chance of extension. Sequences were generated using \ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64) = \ud835\udc64 , \ud835\udc50 = 0.42, \ud835\udc67 = 0.42, \ud835\udc41 = 15, \u0394 = 13, \ud835\udefd = 0.95, and \ud835\udeff \u2208 {0.1, 0.5, 0.9}.\nThe possibility that benefits are extended\u2014or the perception\u2014raises the entire sequence of reservation wages. These types of upward shifts are depicted in figure 3 by the pink, dashed lines in the upper-left corner. These sequences are computed for different values of \ud835\udeff . For example, when \ud835\udeff = 0.1, an extension is perceived to be unlikely relative to the case where \ud835\udeff = 0.9. Reservation wages associated with \ud835\udeff = 0.9 lie above reservation wages associated with \ud835\udeff = 0.1.\nBesides illustrating propositions 1, 2, and 3, figure 3 foreshadows the welfare results. Consider a worker who perceives the probability of extension to be 0.1 when the true probability of an extension is 0.5. In order for the worker to make suboptimal decisions, they need to receive a wage offer between the long-dashed sequence and the dash\u2013dot sequence in figure 3. There isn\u2019t much room to make suboptimal decisions. Initially, at \ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc41 , the worker is rejecting similar offers, as the two lines converge towards the case where benefits are available indefinitely. And even at \ud835\udc5b = 0, a suboptimal decision will occur only when a wage offer falls between 0.864 and 0.825. Put another way, figure 3 suggests that the welfare costs of misperceiving an extension are potentially small.\n13\nNevertheless, policymakers often extend UI benefits temporarily by discretion. Workers are forced to make crucial forecasts about \ud835\udeff and \u0394. The next section considers the welfare consequences of misperceiving the probability and length of an extension."

            "text": "In this section I explore a particular calibration of the model. The calibration is not meant to be definitive. Rather, it is meant to exhibit the features of propositions 2 and 3.\nTo do so, I adopt a uniform wage distribution with support [0, 1].11 For the simulations, the discount factor, \ud835\udefd , is set to 0.95. In the absence of UI compensation and the possibility of an extension, I find the value of nonwork so that the worker expects to be unemployed for 10 periods. I then take both the value of nonwork, \ud835\udc67, and the value of UI compensation, \ud835\udc50 , to be half that value. I set \ud835\udc41 = 10. The true probability of extension is set to 0.5 and the true length of an extension is set to 25. I consider what happens when \ud835\udeff and \u0394 vary from these values.\nFigure 4 compares the expected welfare of misperceiving the probability that benefits are extended. I first compute the expected welfare associated with the baseline case where benefits are extended by \u0394 = 25 periods with probability 0.5. To do this computation, I simulate the model 500 million times and take the average of the computed welfares.12 The welfare calculations add up and discount the flow values of nonwork, any UI benefits, and the value of accepting a job offer.\nA worker is then allowed to hold different beliefs about the possibility of extension. In this scenario, \u0394 does not vary. While the true probability of extension is held at 0.5, the worker believes benefits are extended with probability \ud835\udeff . This misperception causes the worker to compute a sequence of reservation wages that differs from the optimal sequence they would compute if they knew the true probability of extension. When \ud835\udeff = 0.1, for example, the worker believes the extension is unlikely and they are therefore more likely to accept offers they should reject. On average, the worker should remain unemployed more often to search for a better wage. In contrast, when \ud835\udeff = 0.9, the worker believes the extension is likely and they are therefore more likely to reject offers they should accept. On average, the worker should accept more job offers instead of searching for job offers that do not arrive and remaining unemployed.\nThese losses are depicted in figure 4. When the worker\u2019s belief coincides with the true probability of extension, which corresponds to 0 along the horizontal axis, the welfare loss is also 0 (theoretically). This is noted in figure 4 by a horizontal gray, dotted line. As a worker misperceives the probability, they mistakenly reject offers they would optimally accept and accept jobs they would optimally reject. The vertical axis shows the relative welfare loss, computed as the percent away from welfare associated with the true probability that an extension is made.\nThe loss is asymmetric. A pessimistic worker, on average, experiences more loss than an equally optimistic worker. This feature can be seen by comparing the blue region, where the perceived probability of extension is less than 0.5, to the yellow region, where the perceived probability of extension is greater than 0.5.\n11This assumption offers the opportunity to compare numerical work with closed-form expressions. Replication files for the paper compare reservation wages computed using closed-form expressions with those computed using Monte Carlo integration. Closed-form expressions are shared in appendix H.\n12The simulations suggest that welfare is relatively flat, requiring a large number of runs.\n14\nNote: The horizontal axis is the subjective belief a worker holds when computing the sequence of reservation wages less the true probability that benefits are extended. The blue line depicts the loss in welfare associated with misperceiving the probability that benefits are extended. When the worker\u2019s subjective beliefs line up with the true probability at 0 along the horizontal axis, then the welfare loss is zero. The shaded blue region denotes cases where a worker is too pessimistic about an extension. The shaded yellow region denotes cases where a worker is too optimistic about an extension. The true probability of an extension is 0.5.\n15\nYet, as the vertical axis in figure 4 indicates, the loss is very small. What accounts for the small costs of misperception? As suggested by figure 3, reservation wages when \ud835\udeff = 0.5 are close to reservation wages when \ud835\udeff = 0.9 or even when \ud835\udeff = 0.1. Receiving wage offers in the gap between the two sequences is how suboptimal decisions are costly. But the reservation-wage sequences show that even when a worker misperceives the probability of an extension by +0.4 or \u22120.4, they are nearly optimally making job-acceptance decisions. In addition, most spells of unemployment are short. Because sequences of reservation wags quickly converge to the reservation wage that would prevail if benefits were paid indefinitely (seen in figure 3 when the remaining periods of UI compensation equals 15), again, many job acceptance decisions are made nearly optimally.\nA comparison of reservation wages when \ud835\udeff = 0.5 to cases when \ud835\udeff = 0.1 and \ud835\udeff = 0.9 also reveals the source of the asymmetry. When \ud835\udeff = 0.9, reservation wages are nearly indistinguishable in figure 3 to the case where \ud835\udeff = 0.5. In contrast, there is a distinguishable gap when \ud835\udeff = 0.1. To be clear, though, welfare loss is small whether a worker is optimistic or pessimistic about an extension.\nThe same pattern holds when workers misperceive the length of extension, which can be seen by comparing figure 4 to figure 5. To create figure 5, I first compute the expected welfare associated with a baseline. In the baseline, compensation benefits are extended with probability \ud835\udeff = 0.5 for 25 periods. While the true length of an extension is held at 25, the worker holds a different belief about the length of extension, which they use to compute a sequence of reservation wages. Based on this sequence, the worker accepts and rejects offers\u2014suboptimally, as the worker would have computed a different sequence of reservation wages to maximize their expected present value of welfare if they knew the true length of extension. In this scenario, \ud835\udeff does not vary.\nThe exercise is repeated for different beliefs over the length of the extension. Relative losses are depicted in figure 5. Welfare losses are asymmetric and small in magnitude. The magnitudes do suggest, however, that misperceptions about the length of extension may lead to greater welfare loss than misperceptions about the probability of an extension.\nFigures 6 and 7 illustrate the mechanisms through which welfare is lost. Figure 6 illustrates whywelfare is lost when aworkermisperceives the probability of an extension. In the gray region of both panels, looking at the horizontal axes reveals that in these cases the worker perceives that an extension is unlikely relative to the truth. The top panel shows that, on average, workers who are too pessimistic about an extension spend too little time unemployed and searching. If they knew the true probability of extension was higher, then they would reject wage offers they had accepted based on a worse forecast. This dynamic is shown in the bottom panel of the figure, which shows the relative accepted wage. In contrast, in the white region, workers are too optimistic about an extension. They spend too much time searching for a high wage, which costs them through experienced unemployment.\nBoth panels of figure 6 show that misperceptions lead to suboptimal job-acceptance decisions, but these decisions are nearly optimal. The statistics on time spent unemployed and accepted wages corroborate the welfare losses depicted in figure 4. Figure 7 illustrates that the same mechanisms reduce welfare when a worker misperceives the length of an extension. Overly optimistic workers spend too much time unemployed searching for a high wage. Overly pessimistic workers spend too little time unemployed, believing their benefits will soon run out.\n16\nNote: The horizontal axis is the subjective belief about the length of an extension a worker holds when computing the sequence of reservation wages less the true length of an extension. The blue line depicts the loss in welfare. When the worker\u2019s subjective beliefs line up with the true length of an extension at 0 along the horizontal axis, then the welfare loss is zero. The region shaded blue denotes cases where a worker is too pessimistic about the length of the extension. The region shaded yellow denotes cases where a worker is too optimistic about the length of the extension. The true length of an extension is 25.\n17\nNote: The horizontal axis reports the subjective belief a worker holds about the chance of an extensionwhen computing the sequence of reservation wages less the true probability that benefits are extended. The unit of measurement along the horizontal axis is probability. The shaded regions highlight cases where a worker believes an extension is unlikely. The top panel shows the average number of periods a worker spends unemployed relative to the number of periods that would be spent in unemployment if the true probability of an extension were known. The bottom panel shows the average accepted wage, reported as the percent away from the optimal wage.\n18\nNote: The horizontal axis reports the subjective belief a worker holds about the length of an extension when computing the sequence of reservation wages less the true extension length. The unit of measurement along the horizontal axis is periods or weeks. The shaded regions highlight cases where a worker believes an extension will be shorter than what occurs. The top panel shows the average number of periods a worker spends unemployed relative to the number of periods that would be spent in unemployment if the true length of extension were known. The bottom panel shows the average accepted wage, reported as the percent away from the optimal wage.\n19"

            "text": "Propositions 2 and 3 link reservation wages to UI compensation benefits: reservation wages decline as UI compensation expires. This theoretical result is mildly consistent with survey evidence presented by Krueger and Mueller (2016). They asked 6,025 respondents in New Jersey who were unemployed as of September 28, 2009: \u201cSuppose someone offered you a job today. What is the lowest wage or salary you would accept (before deductions) for the type of work you are looking for?\u201d Respondents\u2019 answers across 39,201 interviews indicate that there is \u201clittle tendency for the reservation wage to decline over the spell of unemployment\u201d (Krueger andMueller, 2016, 158 and figure 4).\nWhat could account for a flat sequence of reservation wages? My results suggest that beliefs about extensions may be an important factor. The New Jersey respondents were unemployed as of September 28, 2009, so many were confronted with the possibility that benefits would be extended and they could claim up to 99 weeks of UI compensation. Many, in other words, faced a situation like Vernon\u2019s discussed in section 2.1. Two years later, in September 2011, the unemployment rate was around 9 percent. A worker could interpret these data as evidence that additional extensions would be made available. In addition, the model shows that reservation wages converge somewhat quickly to the level where UI compensation will be available indefinitely. Optimism about an extension and quick convergence both suggest a rule of thumb that computes reservation wages that are close to the reservation wage in the case where benefits are available indefinitely. If workers adopt this rule of thumb on average, then there would indeed be \u201clittle tendency for the reservation wage to decline over the spell of unemployment.\u201d13\nReservation wages may well be more informative than what can be learned in a partialequilibrium setting like the one considered here. Shimer and Werning (2007) point out that a reservation wage makes a worker indifferent between work and nonwork (as in\ud835\udc4a (\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45) = \ud835\udc48 ). In addition, a worker\u2019s take-home pay is directly related to consumption and therefore utility. Thus, the reservation wage (benefits do not expire in their model) measures the utility of unemployed workers. Any policy that raises the single reservation wage will increase workers\u2019 well-being. In particular, if a marginal increase in UI compensation raises a worker\u2019s reservation wage, then the change improves welfare.14 Krueger and Mueller\u2019s (2016) finding that reservation wages do not respond to benefits suggests that increasing UI benefits would not be optimal. But, as pointed out here, that conclusion may be complicated by the uncertainty that surrounded extended benefits after the Great Recession. This perspective raises a number of questions for future research. In particular: What beliefs do people hold about extensions?"

            "text": "My goal was to identify a worker\u2019s costs of misperceiving the probability and length of an extension to UI benefits. As discussed in section 2, navigating possible extensions was an unavoidable feature of job search after the two most recent recessions. The model I presented in section 4\n13Less is known about how psychology influences job search. Two examples are provided by DellaVigna and Paserman (2005) and Paserman (2008), who study how impatience affects search.\n14In related work, Shimer and Werning (2008) establish that optimal UI compensation involves constant or nearly constant benefits and thus a single reservation wage. Both papers informatively consider cases where workers save.\n20\nestablishes channels through which a worker\u2019s welfare can suffer. When policymakers like congressional representatives assure constituents that a significant extension is coming without a doubt, then workers will believe an extension is likely and the length of the extension will provide meaningful support. Workers will adjust their reservation wages upward. If the extension does not come, then workers will have rejected offers they would have liked to accept. On average, workers will experience too much unemployment. The mirror channel operates when a policymaker communicates their disapproval of UI benefits, despite wider support among policymakers that an extension will be granted. The numerical example, however, found small costs to misperceiving the probability and length of an extension. While the calibration is not definitive, the qualitative properties of the model may help explain some limited data on reservation wages.\nGoing beyond this paper, the numerical example suggests that extending benefits when the unluckiest andmost unfortunate need them to avoid misery will alleviate someworst cases. Kahn (2011, 208) points out that searching for work in economic slumps is \u201cparticularly damaging\u201d and notes that the damage extends long into careers. Small dithering costs borne by workers may be worth undertaking in order for policymakers to extend benefits for a preferred length and amount. Clear communication will help. Going forward, extensions may be relied upon more frequently as policymakers are forced to manage not only business cycles but also natural events like viruses, wildfires, extreme heat, and hurricanes."

            "text": "For most people, searching for a job is an inescapable part of life. Its importance is reflected in a voluminous literature on the design of UI systems. While a complete accounting is beyond the scope of this paper, I nevertheless attempt to briefly orient the paper.\nShimer and Werning\u2019s (2007) work, mentioned in section 6, derives a sufficient statistic to check optimality of the studied UI system. For an overview of the sufficient-statistic approach, see Chetty (2009) and Chetty and Finkelstein (2013). Prominent examples of this approach in the context of UI compensation are Chetty (2006) and Chetty (2008). Landais and Spinnewijn (2021) offer a related approach to valuing UI that links structural and reduced-form models. Shimer and Werning\u2019s (2007) analysis is primarily concerned with the level of UI benefit. Along this train of thought, each feature of the UI system could possibly be adjusted to improve well-being. And there are many features to consider as the overviews by Krueger and Meyer (2002), Chetty and Finkelstein (2013), and Schmieder and von Wachter (2016) attest. The remainder of this brief section highlights different features of the UI system.\nOne feature is the effect UI compensation has on labor supply. While no UI compensation seems cruel, enough to fund lavish homes and fancy vacations may halt an economy. Between these extremes is a suitable level that is much debated. Part of this debate is based on labor supply around added periods an unemployed worker can claim UI compensation (Solon, 1979; Card and Levine, 2000; Lalive and Zweim\u00fcller, 2004; Card, Chetty, and Weber, 2007; Lalive, 2007; Card et al., 2015; Chodorow-Reich, Coglianese, and Karabarbounis, 2019; Barbanchon, Rathelot, and Roulet, 2019; Dieterle, Bartalotti, and Brummet, 2020; Marinescu and Skandalis, 2021). Labor supply is perennially held up as an answer to why a labor market may be weak, including after the Great Recession and the COVID-19 pandemic. Labor supply after the Great Recession is studied by Rothstein (2011), Farber, Rothstein, and Valletta (2015), Farber and Valletta (2015), Hagedorn, Manovskii, and Mitman (2016), Johnston and Mas (2018), Hagedorn, Karahan, and Mitman (2019), and Boone et al. (2021). Labor supply after the COVID-19 pandemic is studied by Boar and Mongey (2020), Holzer, Hubbard, and Strain (2021), Albert et al. (2022), PetroskyNadeau (2020), Petrosky-Nadeau and Valletta (2021), and Faberman, Mueller, and \u015eahin (2022). These are not exhaustive lists in any way. Rather, the listed work and the references they cite highlight the importance of the issue.\nExtended UI compensation may keep workers in the labor force. Instead of giving up their search discouraged, a worker may continue their search to claim UI compensation and eventually find work. This point has been made at least since Solon (1979) made it. More recently, Petrosky-Nadeau and Valletta (2021) consider labor-force transitions during the COVID-19 pandemic. There is also the possibility that extended benefits reduce claims for Social Security Disability Insurance (Rutledge, 2011).15\nIn a larger context, extended benefits affect the flow value of nonwork, which is an important parameter in macroeconomic models. This feature of the UI system in the Diamond\u2013Mortensen\u2013 Pissarides class of models is a worker\u2019s threat point in Nash wage bargaining (Chodorow-Reich\n15Autor and Duggan (2003) and Khemka, Roberts, and Higgins (2017) provide background.\n27\nand Karabarbounis, 2016; Ljungqvist and Sargent, 2017; J\u00e4ger et al., 2020). Likewise, access to extended benefits influence efficiency-wage models, where workers are paid above-market-clearing rates (Yellen, 1984). And affect notions of fairness, which matter in practice (Akerlof and Yellen, 1990; Bewley, 1999).\nThe flow value of nonwork in the context of general-equilibrium models of the macroeconomy moves the focus from microeconomic choices to macroeconomic effects. There are two objectives of the UI system: \u201cprovide temporary and partial wage replacement to involuntarily unemployed workers and to stabilize the economy during recessions\u201d (Whittaker and Isaacs, 2022). UI benefits automatically stabilize an economy. In periods of rising unemployment, weekly benefit payments increase and collected payroll taxes decline. The aggregate-demand effects of UI benefits are considered by Mitman and Rabinovich (2015), Kroft and Notowidigdo (2016) and Landais, Michaillat, and Saez (2018). Empirical evidence for these effects is provided byMarinescu (2017) and Marinescu, Skandalis, and Zhao (2021). Kekre (2023) considers extended benefits in a dynamic, stochastic, general-equilibrium model that features incomplete markets.\nExtended benefits may also interact with several other prominent features that are not in the present model. For example, it is easy to imagine that wishful thinking affects reservation wages (Caplin and Leahy, 2019). Or that extensions influence learning about wage offers (Burdett and Vishwanath, 1988). Acemoglu (2001) and Nekoei andWeber (2017) investigate benefits and workers\u2019 subsequent wages, an indicator of match quality. Extensions could also affect selection issues as documented by Hendren (2017), which has implications for private UI markets. Anquandah and Bogachev (2019), for example, consider related UI pricing issues.\nIn summary, the theoretical perspective I have presented raises a number of questions about how perceptions about the probability and length of an extension interact with features of the UI system and what optimal features look like."

The worker is interested in decision rules that indicate whether to accept or reject job offers. As established below, optimal decision-making is characterized by a sequence of reservation wages.\nThe firm side of the economy is modeled as a collection of firms that offer productive opportunities to workers summarized by wage offers. Wages are offered in the range [ \ud835\udc64,\ud835\udc64 ] or [0,\u221e). The other side of the market are workers. A worker receives one independent and identically distributed offer each period. In addition, workers understand that wages are offered according to a given law,\ud835\udc64 \u223c \ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64).\n28\nA job is kept forever.

The sequence of reservation wages, \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (1) , . . . ,\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (\ud835\udc41 ), are then computed, starting from \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (0). It is established that the worker is less selective when there are fewer remaining periods of UI benefits, which is expressed in equation (7) of proposition 1.\n4. The last step establishes that\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (\ud835\udc41 ) < \ud835\udc64 and\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (0) > \ud835\udc64 .\nStep 1: A reservation wage characterizes the worker\u2019s optimal choice. From (15), the payoff of accepting a job is\ud835\udc4a (\ud835\udc64) = \ud835\udc64/(1 \u2212 \ud835\udefd). The set of possible payoffs starts from\ud835\udc64 and goes until \ud835\udc64/(1 \u2212 \ud835\udefd). The value \ud835\udc48 (\ud835\udc5b) is constant. In addition, the most the payoff of unemployment can be is\n\ud835\udc48 (\ud835\udc5b) \u2264 \ud835\udc67 + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc4a (\ud835\udc64)\n= \ud835\udc67 + \ud835\udefd \ud835\udc64 1 \u2212 \ud835\udefd\nas\n\ud835\udc67 + \ud835\udefd \ud835\udc64 1 \u2212 \ud835\udefd < \ud835\udc64 1 \u2212 \ud835\udefd =\ud835\udc4a (\ud835\udc64)\n\u2234 \ud835\udc67 + \ud835\udefd \ud835\udc64 1 \u2212 \ud835\udefd < \ud835\udc64 1 \u2212 \ud835\udefd\n\u2234 \ud835\udc67 < \ud835\udc64\n1 \u2212 \ud835\udefd (1 \u2212 \ud835\udefd)\n\u2234 \ud835\udc67 < \ud835\udc64,\nwhich is true by assumption. Likewise, from (18),\n\ud835\udc48 (\ud835\udc5b) \u2265 \ud835\udc67 + \ud835\udefd \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc64 1 \u2212 \ud835\udefd > \ud835\udc64\n1 \u2212 \ud835\udefd as\n\ud835\udc67 + \ud835\udefd \ud835\udf07\ud835\udc64 1 \u2212 \ud835\udefd > \ud835\udc64\n1 \u2212 \ud835\udefd \u2234 (1 \u2212 \ud835\udefd) \ud835\udc67 + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc64 > \ud835\udc64\nby assumption. Therefore, because\ud835\udc4a is strictly increasing in \ud835\udc64 , there exists a unique \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (\ud835\udc5b) such that\ud835\udc4a (\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (\ud835\udc5b)) = \ud835\udc48 (\ud835\udc5b). This establishes the existence of the reservation wages\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (\ud835\udc5b) for \ud835\udc5b \u2208 {0, . . . , \ud835\udc41 }.\n31\nStep 2: Existence of the reservation wages offers an alternative characterization of the problem. Starting from (19), define the function T as\nT (\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc67 (1 \u2212 \ud835\udefd) + \ud835\udefd {\u222b \ud835\udc65\n\ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64) + \u222b \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64) } . (21)\nThe function T is defined on [ \ud835\udc64,\ud835\udc64 ] . I am interested in T (\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (0)) = \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (0).\nI first prove thatT is a self map; that is, T : [ \ud835\udc64,\ud835\udc64 ] \u2192 [ \ud835\udc64,\ud835\udc64 ] . First, T ( \ud835\udc64 ) = \ud835\udc67 (1 \u2212 \ud835\udefd)+\ud835\udefd\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc64 >\n\ud835\udc64 by assumption. Second, \ud835\udc64 < T (\ud835\udc64) = \ud835\udc67 (1 \u2212 \ud835\udefd) + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc64 < \ud835\udc64 . Lastly, T is strictly increasing on( \ud835\udc64,\ud835\udc64 ) :\nT \u2032 (\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udefd { \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc53 ( \ud835\udc64 ) + \u222b \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc64 1\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64) \u2212\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc53 ( \ud835\udc64 )}\n= \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc65) . where the computation uses Leibniz\u2019s rule. Hence, T : [ \ud835\udc64,\ud835\udc64 ] \u2192 [ \ud835\udc64,\ud835\udc64 ] .\nIn addition, because the derivative of T is T \u2032 (\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc65), it is true that 0 < T \u2032 (\ud835\udc65) < 1 for all \ud835\udc65 \u2208 ( \ud835\udc64,\ud835\udc64 ) . Using the usual metric, \ud835\udc51 (\ud835\udc641,\ud835\udc642) = |\ud835\udc641 \u2212\ud835\udc642 |, T is a contraction on [ \ud835\udc64,\ud835\udc64 ] (Bryant, 1985, 58, theorem 4.2). Because [ \ud835\udc64,\ud835\udc64 ] is complete, the contraction mapping theorem\nestablishes that T admits one and only one fixed point \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (0) \u2208 [ \ud835\udc64,\ud835\udc64 ] (Acemoglu, 2009, 191, theorem 6.7). If instead T : [ \ud835\udc64,\u221e ) \u2192 [ \ud835\udc64,\u221e ) , which is the case for many wage-offer distributions, then the same steps as above verify that T is a self-map. In addition, it can be verified that T is a contraction directly.\nTo do so, it will help to use an equivalent expression for T . I note that\u222b \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64) + \u222b \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64) = \u222b \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64) + \u222b \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64)\n\u2212 \u222b \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64) + \u222b \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64)\n= \u222b \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc65\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64) + \u222b \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc65 (\ud835\udc64 \u2212 \ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64)\n= \ud835\udc65 \u222b \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64) + \u222b \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc65 (\ud835\udc64 \u2212 \ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64)\n= \ud835\udc65 + \u222b \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc65 (\ud835\udc64 \u2212 \ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64) .\n(22)\nAnd integration by parts implies the second term can be written\u222b \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc65 (\ud835\udc64 \u2212 \ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64) = \u222b \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc65 (\ud835\udc64 \u2212 \ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc39 \u2032 (\ud835\udc64) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc64\n= [(\ud835\udc64 \u2212 \ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64)]\ud835\udc64=\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc64=\ud835\udc65 \u2212 \u222b \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc64\n= (\ud835\udc64 \u2212 \ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64) \u2212 \u222b \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc64.\n(23)\n32\nUsing the fact that \u222b \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc65 [\ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64) \u2212 \ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64)] \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc64 = \u222b \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc64 \u2212 \u222b \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc64\n= \ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64) \u222b \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc64 \u2212 \u222b \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc64\n= \ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64) (\ud835\udc64 \u2212 \ud835\udc65) \u2212 \u222b \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc65 \ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc64\nthe latter expression can be written\u222b \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc65 (\ud835\udc64 \u2212 \ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64) = \u222b \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc65 [\ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64) \u2212 \ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64)] \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc64.\nTaking the limit yields\nlim \ud835\udc64\u2192\u221e \u222b \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc65 (\ud835\udc64 \u2212 \ud835\udc65) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64) = lim \ud835\udc64\u2192\u221e \u222b \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc65 [\ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64) \u2212 \ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64)] \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc64\n= \u222b \u221e \ud835\udc65 [1 \u2212 \ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64)] \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc64.\nIn summary, an equivalent expression for T is T (\ud835\udc65) = \ud835\udc67 (1 \u2212 \ud835\udefd) + \ud835\udefd { \ud835\udc65 + \u222b \u221e \ud835\udc65 [1 \u2212 \ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64)] \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc64 } .\nI verify that T is a contraction directly.

Thus\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (\ud835\udc5b) > \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (\ud835\udc5b \u2212 1) for all positive integers \ud835\udc5b.\nStep 4: Finally, I verify that the elements of sequence fall between \ud835\udc64 and \ud835\udc64 . Suppose to the contrary that\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (0) = \ud835\udc64 . From (21),\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (0) satisfies\n\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (0) = \ud835\udc67 (1 \u2212 \ud835\udefd) + \ud835\udefd {\u222b \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (0)\n\ud835\udc64\n\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (0) \ud835\udc51\ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64) + \u222b \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (0) \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64) }\n= \ud835\udc67 (1 \u2212 \ud835\udefd) + \ud835\udefd \u222b \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc64 \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc51\ud835\udc39 (\ud835\udc64)\n= \ud835\udc67 (1 \u2212 \ud835\udefd) + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udf07\ud835\udc64 > \ud835\udc64,\nwhich is a contradiction. Thus \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (0) > \ud835\udc64 . The inequality also holds for the case where the support of wages is [ \ud835\udc64,\u221e ) by the same argument.\n34\nThe proof that\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (\ud835\udc41 ) < \ud835\udc64 is completed by induction. The first part of the induction argument checks that\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (0) and\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (1) are less than\ud835\udc64 on [ \ud835\udc64,\ud835\udc64 ] . Suppose not; that is, suppose\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (0) = \ud835\udc64 . Then the expression for \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (0) implies \ud835\udc64 = \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (0) = \ud835\udc67 (1 \u2212 \ud835\udefd) + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc64 or \ud835\udc64 = \ud835\udc67, which is a contradiction. Thus, \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (0) < \ud835\udc64 . Similarly, suppose \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (1) = \ud835\udc64 . Then the expression for \ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (1) given in (17) implies\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (1) = (\ud835\udc67 + \ud835\udc50) (1 \u2212 \ud835\udefd) + \ud835\udefd\ud835\udc64 , which is a contradiction.\nNext I want to show\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (\ud835\udc41 \u2212 1) < \ud835\udc64 implies\ud835\udc64\ud835\udc45 (\ud835\udc41 ) < \ud835\udc64 .

If the the support of wages is replaced with [\ud835\udc64,\u221e), then each wage will be finite as long as the truncated wage offer distribution has finite expected value, which will be satisfied for many distributions."

In that sense, the McCall model with expiring benefits considered by Burdett (1979) is a particular case of the environment considered here.\nLike in the McCall model with finite benefits, the value of a job is\ud835\udc4a (\ud835\udc64) = \ud835\udc64/(1 \u2212 \ud835\udefd).

Both \ud835\udc48 and \ud835\udc48 \ud835\udeff depend on the remaining periods of UI compensation. Likewise, when there is a perceived chance that benefits will be extended, the reservation wage differs from the case when there is no chance.

In addition, \u03a5 is increasing by lemma 1. Therefore the right\nside is positive. Thus,\ud835\udc64\ud835\udeff \ud835\udc45 (\ud835\udc5b;\u0394\u2022\u2022) > \ud835\udc64\ud835\udeff \ud835\udc45 (\ud835\udc5b;\u0394\u2022) for positive \ud835\udc5b.

How a worker discounts the future and the value of nonwork affect a worker\u2019s sequence of reservation wages. The effect is intuitive, as figure 9 illustrates.\nFor a comparison, figure 9 reports in purple reservation wages for two cases shown in figure 3. The purple solid line reports the sequence of reservation wages upon an extension and the purple broken line reports the sequence of reservation wages when the probability of extension is perceived to be 0.5. When \ud835\udefd increases, workers are more patient. They are more selective throughout unemployment spells and their sequences of reservation wages shift upward. The higher-\ud835\udefd case is depicted in dark blue. When \ud835\udc50 is lower, workers receive less in UI compensation each period. They are less selective selective through unemployment spells and their sequences of reservation wages shift downward. This is depicted in light blue. Because workers have the same \ud835\udefd and the same \ud835\udc67 in the baseline and low-\ud835\udc50 parameterizations, the reservation wage upon an extension when there are no remaining periods of UI compensation are the same. In contrast, when \ud835\udc67 is lower, which is depicted in green, sequences of reservation wages are lower throughout workers\u2019 unemployment spells."
