 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming the given paper:

1. Develop more complex compartmental models for COVID-19 using piecewise fractional derivatives to capture additional dynamics like exposed, recovered, etc. This could provide more accurate predictions.

2. Apply piecewise fractional derivatives to other infectious disease models like influenza, measles, etc. to see if they can better capture the dynamics compared to regular fractional models.

3. Conduct stability and bifurcation analysis on the COVID-19 model to understand how the dynamics change based on model parameters. This could guide intervention strategies. 

4. Validate the accuracy of the piecewise fractional model predictions against real-world COVID-19 data. Compare to regular fractional and integer-order models.

5. Extend the piecewise fractional derivative approach to networked epidemic models and metapopulation models to study disease spread through interconnected communities. The short-memory effects could be relevant.
