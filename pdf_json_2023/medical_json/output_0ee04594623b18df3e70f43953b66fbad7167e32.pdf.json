    "abstractText": "The nucleocapsid protein Np of SARS-CoV-2 is involved in the replication, transcription, and packaging of the viral genome, but it also plays a role in the modulation of the host cell innate immunity and inflammation response. Ectopic expression of Np alone was able to induce significant changes in the proteome of human cells. The cellular RNA helicase DDX1 was among the proteins whose levels were increased by Np expression. DDX1 and its related helicase DDX3X were found to physically interact with Np and to increase 2to 4-fold its affinity for double-stranded RNA in a helicase-independent manner. Conversely, Np inhibited the RNA helicase activity of both proteins. These functional interactions among Np and DDX1 and DDX3X highlight novel possible roles played by these host RNA helicases in the viral life cycle.",

            "text": "The coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 is the causative agent of the current pandemic of COVID-19. Following a zoonotic spillover from an as yet unknown animal reservoir in mainland China in 2019, SARS-CoV-2 rapidly spread all over the world. The accelerated development of vaccines, monoclonal antibodies and antivirals has provided an effective means to counteract the most severe consequences of the infection. However, the efficacy of the currently available vaccines and antibodies is being challenged by the rapid emergence of SARS-CoV-2 variants, carrying immune escape mutations on the Spike glycoprotein, the major viral antigen. Thus, it is essential to develop alternative approaches which can counteract SARS-CoV-2 infection. To this aim, developing a deeper understanding of the interplay among viral and host proteins is of great importance. The positive sense single-stranded (ss) RNA genome of SARS-CoV-2 comprises 14 open reading frames (ORFs), encoding four structural and 16 non-structural proteins. The ninth ORF encodes for the nucleocapsid protein (Np). Np is highly conserved among the genus coronavirus and represents one of the most abundant structural proteins expressed in SARS-CoV-2 infected cells. Np consists of 419 aminoacids (aa) and it is organized into two structured modules, the N-terminal domain (NTD) and the C-terminal domain (CTD), which are connected by the intrinsically disordered region (IDR) Ser-/Arg-rich flexible linker (LKR). Two additional IDRs, the N-arm (aa 1\u201343) and the C-tail (aa 365\u2013419), are present at the extreme N- and C-terminal parts of the protein, respectively [1]. While the NTD and CTD isolated domains have been crystalized, the presence of the IDRs makes the resolution of the structure of the full-length Np a challenging task. A combination of structural studies,\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2023, 24, 5784. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms24065784 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nin silico modeling and small-angle X-ray scattering revealed that the NTD, CTD and LKR domains are involved in RNA binding [2]. Molecular modeling suggested that Np can bind both ss and dsRNA. Electron microscopy analysis, combined with dynamics simulations, suggested that in its unbound state Np exists as a dimer in solution with the NTD and CTD domains in an extended conformation. Conversely, the binding of RNA induces a compact conformation and triggers the cooperative formation of higher-order Np\u2013RNA oligomeric complexes such as tetramers, hexamers or octamers [3\u20136]. The ability of Np to form protein-RNA filaments is essential for the packaging of the viral genomic (g) RNA into the new virions [1]. However, coronavirus Np has been also shown to participate in the genome transcription process, facilitating the synthesis of subgenomic (sg) viral mRNAs by binding to regulatory gRNA regions [7,8]. In addition, Np can modulate the host cell metabolism, suppressing the host innate immune response [9,10]. Np interacts with the host receptor RIG-I, preventing its binding to the E3 ligase TRIM25 [11], and with the STAT1/2 transcriptional activators, inhibiting their phosphorylation by the JAK1/TYK2 kinases and subsequent nuclear translocation [12]. Thanks to these interactions, Np acts as a potent antagonist of the IFN response. Np can also inhibit the formation of viral-induced stress granules, a host defense mechanism, by sequestering the proteins G3BP1/2 [13,14]. A central role in the host IFN response is played by the cellular DEAD-box RNA helicases DDX3X and DDX1 [15]. DDX3X binds to viral dsRNA and recruits the RIG-I-stimulating factor IPS-1, promoting IFN-b production [16]. In addition, it is ubiquitinated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase TRIM25, resulting in further stimulation of the IFN-b response [17]. DDX1 also binds dsRNA as part of a viral RNA sensor complex, together with the RNA helicases DDX21 and DHX36 and the adaptor protein TRIF, which triggers the IFN-b response [18]. Besides their roles in innate immunity, DDX3X and DDX1 are involved in many aspects of RNA metabolism, from mRNA synthesis, maturation and nuclear export to miRNA biogenesis and protein translation [19]. Several RNA viruses encode viral proteins, which physically interact with these RNA helicases. Such a hijacking strategy has a dual role: on the one hand, to prevent DDX3X and/or DDX1 from activating the innate immune response, and, on the other hand, to exploit these RNA helicases for promoting viral genome replication and transcription, as well as viral protein expression. For these reasons, DDX3X and DDX1 are considered promising targets for antiviral therapy [20,21]. The Np of different coronaviruses has been shown to physically interact with both DDX3X and DDX1 [22]. Indeed, through immunoprecipitation and colocalization studies in infected cells, SARS-CoV-2 Np has been shown to interact with both DDX3X and DDX1 [23]. However, the available data did not allow us to determine whether the interaction of SARS-CoV-2 Np with DDX3X and DDX1 was direct or instead mediated by other factors such as RNA or proteins. In addition, the functional consequences of these interactions with the biochemical properties of either the RNA helicases or Np are currently not yet clarified. Here, we show that ectopic expression of SARS-CoV-2 Np induces significant changes in the proteome of the human A549 lung adenocarcinoma cell line. DDX1 was one of the proteins that was most enriched upon Np expression. About 60% of the differentially expressed proteins found in our analysis have been also previously identified as part of the Np interactome of SARS-CoV-2 Np in the Calu-3 lung cell line. Interestingly, several of the Np interactors present in our dataset are known interactors of either DDX1 or DDX3X as well. Most notably, DDX1 is listed among the interactors of both Np and DDX3 and it was enriched in our analysis upon Np ectopic expression in A549 lung carcinoma cells. Considering that DDX3X and DDX1 interact with hundreds of other cellular proteins, the Np-DDX1-DDX3X reciprocal interaction might represent an important node in the Np-mediated network of interactions with the host cell proteome. Thus, we investigated the possible functional consequences of such interactions on their common substrate dsRNA. The expression and purification of recombinant SARS-CoV-2 Np and human DDX3X and\nDDX1 allowed us to confirm their direct physical interaction. Biochemical characterization of these proteins, either alone or in combination, showed that they reciprocally modulated their interaction with dsRNA. These findings are discussed in the context of the possible roles played by DDX1 and DDX3X in the viral life cycle."

In total, 4306 master proteins were identified with at least one unique peptide and mapped to 4170 unique gene symbols, acquiring three biological replicates in triplicate runs for the two examined conditions. The application of linear discriminant analysis (LDA [24]) to the 18 protein lists allowed us to extract statistically significant proteins (F ratio \u2265 4.5 and p < 0.05) which could then be processed by hierarchical clustering, highlighting a clear separation in the two main branches and the different behaviour of A549 cells expressing when either an empty vector or SARS-CoV-2 Np, as reported in Figure 1.\nThen, all proteins identified in single runs were aligned to create a unique list for each experimental group, normalizing and averaging [25] the peptide spectrum match values (aPSMs) attributed to the proteins, which represent the number of mass spectra assigned to each and also indirectly demonstrate their abundance in the samples (see Supplementary Table S1). Using the homemade algorithm MAProMa and applying its two algorithms, DAve (Differential Average) and DCI (Differential Confidence Index), to the aPSMs of each single protein between the two compared terms, it was possible to perform a differential analysis and to quantitatively examine the proteomic changes due to the expression of SARS-CoV-2 Np. In Figure 2, the bar charts show the distribution of up-regulated proteins with a variation greater than a fold change of 1.5 in the two examined conditions according to their DAve values. Proteins with a DAve (ratio of protein expression) \u2265 |0.35| and a DCI (confidence of differential expression) \u2265 |5| pass the filters and could be considered differentially expressed in the considered comparison. Moreover, to emphasize highly expressed proteins extracted in each of the two compared groups, Voronoi graphs (Supplementary Figure S2) in which the polygons and their different sizes represent,\nrespectively the involved functional categories and their degree of enrichment have been constructed.\nCombining LDA and MAProMa results, 198 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) were extracted between A549 cells transfected with the empty vector and SARS-CoV-2 Np (see Supplementary Table S2). In particular, 93 proteins were up-regulated in A549 cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 N protein and 105 were up-regulated in A549 cells expressing an empty vector. Notably, proteins that were up-regulated in the first condition of comparison are to be considered down-regulated in the second one and vice versa. With the aim of achieving better visualization of the pathways and the biological relevant interactions, the STRING database [26] was consulted in order to build a network of both known and predicted protein\u2013protein interactions. Those proteins that were differentially expressed, were represented as nodes, being grouped into sub-networks based on their molecular function and connected by grey edges indicating protein\u2013protein interactions. Figure 3 shows the PPI network obtained by the comparison of the two A549 cell types.\nThe comparison of the 198 differentially expressed proteins (DEPs) between A549 cells transfected with empty vectors and SARS-CoV-2 Np-expressing cells, with the published SARS-CoV-2 N-interacting proteins in the lung cell line Calu-3 [27], revealed an overlap of 123/198 (62%) proteins present in both datasets (Supplementary Table S2) and that they share 37/198 hits (18.7%) with known Np interactors from the BioGRID database [28]. Notably, DDX1 is significantly enriched in A549 cells expressing Np (Figure 2) and its presence is also reported among the DDX3X interactors in the STRING database (https://string-db.org/, last accessed on 3 March 2023). Considering that DDX1 and DDX3X interact with hundreds of cellular proteins, this analysis suggests that the Np-DDX1-DDX3X reciprocal interaction might constitute an important node in the complex network of interactions of Np with the host cell proteome."

The\noptimal substrate of DDX1 and DDX3X RNA helicases is dsRNA with a short 5\u2032-protruding ss end. SARS-CoV-2 Np has been shown to bind structured partially dsRNA regions such as stem-loops with high affinity [6]. Thus, the binding of recombinant Np to dsRNA was assessed by EMSA. A fluorescently labelled 18/38 mer partially dsRNA oligonucleotide with a 5\u2032-protruding end was used, which is the preferred substrate for the DDX1 and DDX3X RNA helicases. Np was able to shift the partially dsRNA substrate (Figure 4B, lanes 5\u201310; Figure 4C, lanes 2\u20137), generating signals with different electrophoretic mobilities (Figure 4B,C, indicated by asterisks), as is consistent with the formation of protein\u2013RNA complexes of increasing molecular weight. Quantification of the signals allowed us to reveal a cooperative binding mode, consistent with previous results [3], and an apparent binding affinity of 0.17 \u00b5M (Figure 4D). Next, the interaction of Np with the partially dsRNA substrate was tested in the presence of increasing NaCl concentrations in a physiological range of 25\u2013200 mM (Figure 4E, lanes 7\u201310).

            "text": "In preliminary experiments, the combination of Np with DDX3X or DDX1 apparently increased the amounts of Np\u2013RNA complexes (Supplementary Figure S3). In order to more precisely investigate the mechanism of Np\u2013RNA complex stimulation by the two RNA helicases, Np titrations were performed in the presence of partially dsRNA and in the absence or presence of a fixed amount of either DDX3X or DDX1 and analyzed in EMSA assays. Increasing amounts of Np alone resulted in a proportional increase in Np\u2013RNA complexes (Figure 6A,B, lanes 2\u20135 and Supplementary Figure S4). The addition of a fixed amount of DDX3X (Figure 6A, lanes 6\u20139 and Supplementary Figure S4) or DDX1 (Figure 6B, lanes 6\u20139 and Supplementary Figure S4) caused increases in the high molecular weight complexes. Quantification of the shifted products in two independent experiments allowed us to perform the analysis of the binding kinetics. The best fitting was obtained with a cooperative binding mode equation. As shown in Figure 6C,D, Np alone showed a Hill coefficient of 1.2\u20131.4 and an apparent dissociation constant for dsRNA KD of 0.17\u20130.22 \u00b5M, which are consistent with the results shown in Figure 4D. The addition of DDX3X resulted in a KD of 0.08 \u00b5M (Figure 6C), while the addition of DDX1 resulted in a KD of 0.04 \u00b5M (Figure 6D). Thus, both RNA helicases increased 2- to 4-fold the apparent affinity of Np for the dsRNA. Next, Np was titrated in the presence of a DDX3X catalytically dead mutant, where the two aspartic acids of the Walker B D-E-A-D motif had been mutated to alanines (mutant DDX3XDADA). These mutants are devoid of ATPase and helicase activities [29]. The DDX3XDADA mutant was still able to stimulate the RNA binding activity of Np (Figure 6E, compare lanes 2\u20136 with lanes 7\u201310), increasing 3- fold its apparent affinity, as shown by the decreasing KD value from 0.3 \u00b5M to 0.1 \u00b5M (Figure 6F). Overall, these data indicated that DDX3X and DDX1 were able to stimulate the binding affinity of Np to dsRNA and that the helicase activity was not necessary for such stimulation."

            "text": "Besides driving the packaging of the viral genome, SARS-CoV-2 Np plays additional important roles in several aspects of the viral life cycle. Several studies showed that Np undergoes liquid\u2013liquid phase separation (LLPS) to form protein\u2013RNA compartments in the cytosol. These have been shown to enhance recruitment of viral and host proteins in ribonucleoprotein complexes during the replication and transcription of the viral gRNA [30,31]. Transcription of the viral genome generates sgmRNAs through a template switching mechanism from internal transcription regulatory sequences (body TRS), located in front of each gene, to the leader TRS located at the 5\u2032-end of the genome [8,32]. The extensive stem-loop structures, present in the gRNA among the body TRS, have been demonstrated to be engaged in long-range RNA\u2013RNA interactions critical for template switching [33]. SARS-CoV-2 Np was shown to bind TRS, probably facilitating long distance interactions between differently structured gRNA regions thanks to its ability to form multimers and undergo LLPS [34]. Interestingly, the JHMV-CoV Np was found to interact, upon phosphorylation, with the RNA helicase DDX1. This Np/DDX1 complex was shown to regulate the synthesis of long sgmRNAs by modulating the rate of template switching from the different body TRS encountered by the transcription complex. Interestingly, only the overexpression of the wild type, but not of an inactive mutant of DDX1, promotes the synthesis of long sgmRNAs, suggesting that the enzymatic activity of DDX1 is important for stimulation of viral RNA synthesis and could maybe help to resolve RNA secondary structures [35]. In this work, applying a label-free shotgun proteomic approach, we were able to show that a significant alteration in A549 human cells is induced by SARS-CoV-2 Np expression. A great number of differentially expressed proteins, resulting from the comparison of A549 cells transfected with empty vector and SARS-CoV-2 Np, are already known as SARS-CoV-2 Np interactors. In fact, the PPI network built based on these proteins highlights deregulated the pathways involved in RNA processes (splicing and translation), immune response, cytoskeleton organization and mitochondrial metabolisms, as emerged from previous studies, despite the use of different techniques and cell lines. Moreover, we provide the first evidence, to the best of our knowledge, that SARS-CoV-2 Np also directly interacts with DDX1 in its unphosphorylated form and that such interaction is not mediated by other components, whether RNA or proteins. The Np\u2013DDX1 complex shows a higher affinity for dsRNA than Np alone while also suppressing the DDX1 RNA helicase activity. In the context of the template-switching mechanism discussed above, it can be hypothesized that DDX1 can be recruited at the viral transcription complex, maybe through its interaction with Nsp14, as reported for IBV-CoV and SARS-CoV [22], helping the RdRP to overcome secondary structures. The advancing transcription complex might then encounter Np which is bound to the structured region around the TRS located in proximity of the 5\u2032-end of the genome. There, interaction between Np and DDX1 will inhibit the RNA helicase activity, leading to the formation of a stable Np\u2013DDX1 complex, which could function as a signal for the termination of viral RNA synthesis. Indeed, in JHMV-CoV, it has been shown that the Np/DDX1 complex has higher affinity for the regions proximal to the 5\u2032-end TRS (with the exception of the 5\u2032-terminal leader TRS). The Np/DDX1 complex could then mediate the template switching from the body TRS to the leader TRS. The ability of Np to undergo multimerization and LLPS in the presence of dsRNA may facilitate the genome cyclization, which has been proposed as exposing the leader TRL for base pairing with the nascent sgmRNA [33]. We have shown that DDX1 interaction does not prevent Np multimerization on dsRNA. Thus, the DDX1\u2013Np complex might provide a stable platform for the pairing of the body TRS with the leader TRS thanks to its high affinity for dsRNA, at the same time preventing the DDX1 RNA helicase activity from interfering with the template switching. Np is also an important modulator of the host immune response [9,10]. SARS-CoV-2 Np inhibits the dsRNA recognition by the RIG-I receptor, preventing with its ubiquitination the binding of the E3 ligase TRIM25 and inhibiting the formation of antiviral stress\ngranules (SGs) through its interaction with the G3BP1 protein [11,13]. In addition, Np can directly bind to RIG-I, preventing the downstream signaling cascade and leading to IRF3 phosphorylation and nuclear translocation [14]. All these mechanisms repress IFN-b production. RIG-I binding of dsRNA leads to the activation of the IPS-1 (MAV) adaptor protein located on the outer mitochondrial membrane. This in turn mobilizes the kinase complex TBK1/IKKe, phosphorylating the transcription factor IRF3 which leads to IFN-b production [36]. DDX3X has been shown to be an essential component of this pathway. DDX3X interacts with TRIM25 and can stimulate IFN-b production by directly binding with dsRNA and forming a complex with IPS-1. After this, it acts further downstream, associating with the TBK1/IKKe complex, enhancing its activity, and also functioning as a transcriptional coactivator of the IFNB1 gene promoter [17]. In this context, our results might suggest that Np can sequester DDX3X in a stable complex with dsRNA, preventing its interaction with IPS-1. In addition, by binding with DDX3X, Np might prevent its association with the TBK1/IKKe and its nuclear binding to the IFNB1 promoter, resulting in a potent inhibition of the IFN-b response, analogously to what has been observed for other viruses. DDX3X is also essential for the formation of antiviral SGs, large ribonucleoprotein complexes which can sequester viral mRNAs, suppressing their translation [37]. DDX3X also regulates inflammasome activation by the NLRP3 protein. DDX3X interacts with NLP3 to induce inflammasome complex formation, after which DDX3X also stimulates SG formation. Sequestration of DDX3X within SGs competes for its binding to NLRP3, thus reducing inflammasome activation [38,39]. Notably, SARS-CoV-2 Np was shown to directly bind to NLRP3, inducing a strong inflammatory response through inflammasome activation [40]. Thus, by sequestering DDX3X, Np can prevent antiviral SGs formation, at the same time replacing DDX3X in the interaction with NLRP3 in order to maintain inflammasome activation. Interestingly, DDX3X has been proposed to act by promoting the LLPS of ribonucleoprotein complexes [41]. Thus, its sequestration by Np might also stimulate the Np LLPS activity. Finally, DDX3X inhibition by small molecules or siRNA was shown to suppress SARS-CoV-2 replication, suggesting a proviral role [42,43]. While the mechanistic details of such a role remain so far elusive, an intriguing hypothesis is that DDX3X might be re-directed through interaction with Np to the lipid structures where the viral replication/transcription complex (RTC) is located. A similar redistribution of DDX3X at sites of viral replication has been shown for DDX3X in the context of HCV infection [44]."

The following criteria were used for the identification of peptide sequences and related proteins: trypsin and Lys-C as enzymes, methionine oxidation, carbamidomethyl at cysteins, three missed cleavages per peptide, with mass tolerances of \u00b150 ppm for precursor ions and \u00b10.8 Da for fragment ions. Percolator node was used with a target-decoy strategy to give a final false discovery rate (FDR) at a peptide spectrum match (PSM) level of 0.01 (strict) based on q-values, considering a maximum deltaCN of 0.05 [45]. Only peptides with a minimum peptide length of six amino acids and rank 1 were considered. Protein grouping and a strict parsimony principle were applied. Results were then exported to an Excel file for further processing."

Ward\u2019s method and the Euclidean\u2019s distance metric were applied using the JMP 15.2 software. Then, all protein lists were aligned, normalized with the total signal normalization method and compared by means of the average peptide spectrum matches (aPSM) [46,47], corresponding to the average of all the spectra identified for a protein and, consequently, to its relative abundance in each analyzed condition. In depth, to select differentially expressed proteins, A549 cells transfected with an empty vector and with SARS-CoV-2 N protein were compared, applying a threshold of 0.35 and 5 on the two MAProMa indexes, DAve (Differential Average) and DCI (Differential Confidence Index), respectively [48]. DAve, which evaluates changes in protein expression, was defined as (X \u2212 Y)/(X + Y)/0.5, with values ranging from a maximum of +2.00 to a minimum of \u22122.00, while DCI, which evaluates the confidence of differential expression, was defined as (X + Y) x (X \u2212 Y)/2, with values ranging from +\u221e to \u2212\u221e. The X and Y terms represent the aPSMs of a given protein in two compared samples. Visualization of proteome enrichment was obtained using interactive Proteomaps (available at www.proteomaps.net accessed on 22 October 2022) [49] that automatically built Voronoi graphs from proteome data and\nbased on the KEGG pathways gene classification. Each protein is shown by a polygon and functionally related proteins are arranged in common regions whose size is a function of the abundance of the proteins themselves. Starting from the DEPs, a protein\u2013protein interaction (PPI) network (197 nodes and 3393 edges) was built by STRING database [50]; only experimentally and database-defined PPIs with a score >0.15 were considered. The resulting sub-network was visualized and analyzed by Cytoscape v. 3.9.1 and its plugins [51]. The proteins were grouped into functional modules by the support of STRING enrichment, using default settings. Node colors reflected the differential expression of DEPs in the two examined conditions."

Recombinant Np protein was expressed overnight in BL21(DE3) E. coli cells with 0.2 mM IPTG at 37 \u25e6C and purified mainly as described in [52] with few modifications. Briefly, the bacterial cell pellet was resuspended in a low salt buffer (20 mM Tris pH 8, 20 mM KCl, 0.5 mM EDTA, protease inhibitor) and lysed by adding lysozyme 1 mg/mL and using sonication. After centrifugation at 20,000 rpm for 30 min, the clear supernatant was sequentially incubated with Q-Sepharose fast flow and SP-Sepharose fast flow resins (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) for 2 h and with the Np protein eluted from SP resin using 200\u20131000 mM KCl gradient at pH 8. Then, the 500\u20131000 mM fractions were pooled and incubated with Ni-NTA resin (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) for 2 h at 4 \u25e6C.

The Np DNA sequence was subcloned BamHI-NotI in pET HIS6-MBP-TEV empty vector (Addgene, Watertown, MA, USA) to obtain the plasmid pET HIS6-MBP-TEV-Np necessary for the expression of MBP-Np protein in a pull-down assay. Human recombinant proteins DDX3X and DDX3XDADA (D347A/D350A) mutant used in helicase and EMSA assays were obtained from plasmids pET30a(+)-DDX3X and pET30a(+)-DDX3XDADA, respectively. All the proteins were purified from ShuffleT7 E. coli soluble fractions, as already described [53]. Recombinant DDX1 was obtained from the pET30a(+)-DDX1 plasmid with the same purification procedure as described for DDX3X [32]. The pH6HTN-His6-Halotag-DDX3X plasmid was used for the expression of the HALO-DDX3X protein in a pull-down experiment. For plasmid construction, the DNA sequence of DDX3X was amplified from pET30a(+)-DDX3X with specific primers, namely forward (5\u2032-GCTAGGATATCAATGAGTCATGTGGCAGTGGAAAA-3\u2032) and reverse (5\u2032-ATATAGCGGCCGCTCAGTTACCCCACCAGTCAACC-3\u2032) (Eurofins Genomics, Ebersberg, Germany) and cloned EcoRV-NotI in a pH6HTN-His6-Halotag empty vector (Promega, Madison, MD, USA)."

As discussed above, the viral Np as well as the host DDX1 and DDX3X modulate several important aspects of the viral life cycle and of the host immune response. The novel functional interaction among these proteins described here not only adds to our understanding of the virus\u2013host interface at the molecular level, but can also suggest innovative therapeutic approaches. For example, protein\u2013protein interaction inhibitors could be designed to disrupt the binding of Np to DDX1 and/or DDX3X. Additionally, PROTACs constructs could be developed based on the interaction domains among these proteins to specifically target the Np\u2013DDX1/\u2013DDX3X complexes for degradation.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https:// www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms24065784/s1.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, G.M. and P.L.M.; methodology and investigation, M.S., C.L., V.S., A.D.P. and R.R.; software, A.D.P. and R.R.; validation, M.S., C.L. and V.S.; formal analysis, G.M., A.D.P. and D.P.; resources, G.M.; data curation, M.S., C.L., A.D.P., R.R. and D.P.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, M.S., C.L. and A.D.P.; writing\u2014review and editing, G.M. and A.D.P.; visualization, G.M., R.R. and D.P.; supervision and project administration, G.M. and P.L.M.; funding acquisition, G.M. and P.L.M.
