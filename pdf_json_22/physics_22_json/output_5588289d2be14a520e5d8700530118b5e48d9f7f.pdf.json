    "abstractText": "Conventional photovoltaic (PV) grid-connected systems consist of a boost converter cascaded with an inverter, resulting in poor efficiency due to performing energy processing twice. Many pseudo DC-link inverters with single energy processing have been proposed to improve system efficiency and simplify circuits. However, their output voltage gain is limited by the non-ideal characteristics of the power diode, making them difficult to apply in high-output voltage applications. This paper proposes combining a boost converter with magnetic coupling and a full-bridge unfolding circuit to develop an inverter featuring high voltage-gain and high efficiency. According to the desired instantaneous output voltage, the high-gain boost converter and the full-bridge unfolding circuit are sequentially and respectively controlled by SPWM. A sinusoidal output voltage can be generated by performing energy processing only once, effectively improving the conversion efficiency. Magnetic coupling is adopted to increase the voltage gain of step-up, and the step-down function is realized by the full-bridge unfolding circuit to reduce conduction loss. Finally, a 500 W prototype was fabricated for the proposed high-gain inverter. The experimental results were used to verify the correctness of the theoretical analysis and the feasibility of the circuit structure.",

Introduction\nRecently, air pollution has become increasingly serious due to the high consumption of fossil fuels. To reduce carbon dioxide emissions to mitigate global warming and climate change, many researchers are committed to developing renewable energy sources such as photovoltaic (PV), wind, hydro, geothermal and biogas [1\u20133]. Among them, PV energy is attracting increasing attention, and is widely used around the world. There are three types of PV power systems: grid-connected, stand-alone, and hybrid [4\u20136], in which gridconnected systems are the most popular. The PV grid-connected system converts the direct current (DC) of solar energy into alternating current (AC) and feeds it into the grid [7,8]. Due to the low voltage of the PV panels, a low-frequency transformer needs to be added after the inverter in order to be connected with utility, as shown in Figure 1a. However, the low-frequency transformer significantly increases the size and cost of this PV power system. The transformer-less PV grid-connected system is the alternative structure, as shown in Figure 1b. It uses a boost converter to step-up the PV voltage and then converts it to AC power for connection with the utility [9,10]. The transformer-less structure has the advantages of small size and low cost, but its efficiency is reduced because of multiple energy processing stages. Several single-stage inverters derived from boost or buck converters have been proposed to improve the efficiency [11\u201313], but their application is limited by the need for multiple input sources and the inability to cover a wide range of input voltage variations. Therefore, many pseudo DC-Link inverters have been proposed to overcome these drawbacks [14\u201318]. Figure 2 shows the block diagram of the pseudo DC-Link inverter, in which a DC/DC converter with both step-up and step-down capabilities is used to generate a\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1568. https://doi.org/10.3390/mi13101568 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/micromachines\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1568 2 of 16\nrectified sine wave with unipolarity, and an unfolding circuit is cascaded to switch the polarity and to obtain a sinusoidal output voltage. Since the unfolding circuit switches only with the frequency of utility line, a pseudo DC-link inverter that requires only one energy processing can effectively improve conversion efficiency. However, the step-down function is achieved by connecting an additional power switch in series, resulting in higher conduction loss. In addition, the output voltage gain is limited because of the non-ideal characteristics of the power diode, making it unusable for low input voltage or high output voltage applications.\nMicromachines 2022, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 17\nTherefore, many pseudo DC-Link inverters have been proposed to overcome these drawbacks [14\u201318].

In step-down mode, the switch SBo remains in off state, and the diode DBo remains in the on state. The switches SBu1 and SBu2 are controlled by high-frequency SPWM and switch complementarily. The switches SBu3 and SBu4 switch complementarily with line frequency. Additionally, the low-pass filter is used to filter out the high-frequency components of the output voltage. When the desired output voltage is higher than the input voltage, the proposed inverter enters step-up mode. In this mode, the switch SBo switches with the high-frequency SPWM control.

In BCM, the average inductor current ILB within one high-frequency cycle can be calculated as follows:\nILB = 1 2\u0394iLP(close)\u00d7dBo + 1 2\u0394iLP open \u00d7(1\u2212 dBo) (18)\nThe amount of current increase and decrease on the primary winding in BCM have the following relationship:\n\u0394iLP(open) = \u0394iLP(close) (1 + N) (19)\nSubstituting Equation (19) into Equation (18) gives\nFigure 10. The equivalent circuits of the inverter operating in step-up mode during the negative half cycle: (a) SBo on; (b) SBo off.\nAccording to the analysis above, the status of all switching elements is listed in Table 1. It can be clearly understood that the proposed inverter has only two power elements switching with high frequency in both step-down and step-up modes; therefore, switching losses can be reduced to improve the efficiency.\nTable 1.

Design Considerations\nTo explain how to determine the component parameters, the design considerations of the coupled inductor, the semiconductor components, and the output filter are addressed in this s ction.\n4.1. Boundary Condition of the Coupled Inductor\nIf the coupled inductor operates in boundary conduction mode (BCM), the minimum current on the primary side iLP(T\u2212), as shown in Figure 8, will reach zero just before the switch SBo enters the next switching cycle. In BCM, the average inductor current ILB within one high-frequency cycle can be calculated as follows:\nILB = 1 2 \u2206iLP(close)\u00d7dBo + 1 2 \u2206iLP(open)\u00d7(1 \u2212 dBo) (18)\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1568 9 of 16\nThe amount of current increase and decrease on the primary winding in BCM have the following relationship:\n\u2206iLP(open) = \u2206iLP(close) (1 + N)\n(19)\nSubstituting Equation (19) into Equation (18) gives\nILB = \u2206iLP(close) \u00d7 (1 + Nd Bo ) 2(1 + N)\n(20)\nSubstituting Equation (4) into Equation (20) yields\nILB = VDC \u00d7 dBoT \u00d7 (1 + Nd Bo)\n2LP(1 + N) (21)\nSince the average current ILB is equal to the instantaneous input current, the boundary condition Io(B) of the instantaneous output current can be obtained from Equations (16) and (21), and the relationship of power balance as follows:\nIo(B) = VDC \u00d7 dBoT \u00d7 (1 \u2212 dBo)\n2LP(1 + N) (22)\nWhen the instantaneous output current io(t) is equal to Io(B), the proposed inverter operates in BCM, and the boundary inductance of the primary winding LP(B) can be obtained as follows:\nLP(B) = VDC \u00d7 dBoT \u00d7 (1 \u2212 dBo)\n2 \u00d7 io(t)\u00d7 (1 + N) (23)\n4.2. Voltage Stresses of the Power Components\nWhen the switch SBo turns off in step-up mode, as shown in Figure 9b, the maximum voltage stress on SBo occurs at the peak output voltage, and can be expressed as follows:\nVds, Bo(Max)= VDC + VM \u2212 VDC\n1 + N (24)\nWhen the switch SBo turns on, the diode DBo is forced to turn off, as shown in Figure 9a. The maximum voltage stress on DBo also occurs at the peak output voltage, and can be expressed as follows:\nVD\u2212Bo(Max)= NVDC+VM, (25)\nThe maximum voltage stress on both the capacitor Co and the capacitor Cf is the peak output voltage VM, and can be expressed as follows:\nVCo(Max)= VC f (Max)= VM, (26)\nAccording to Figures 9 and 10, the voltage stresses on the switches SBu1, SBu2, SBu3 and SBu4 are equal to the voltage across the capacitor Co. Therefore, the maximum voltage stresses on these four switches of the unfolding circuit can expressed as follows:\nVds, Bu1(Max)= Vds, Bu2(Max)= Vds, Bu3(Max)= Vds, Bu4(Max)= VM. (27)\n4.3. Current Stresses of the Power Components\nWhen the inverter operates in step-up mode and the switch SBo turns on, the current in the primary winding of the coupled inductor rises. When the output voltage vo reaches the peak VM, the current stress on the primary winding reaches its maximum, as indicated below:\nILP(Max) = VM (1 + Nd Bo)\nR(1 \u2212 dBo) + VDCdBoT LP\n(28)\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 1568 10 of 16\nWhen the switch SBo turns off, the diode DBo is forward biased. The primary and secondary windings are connected in series to the discharge, so the maximum current stress of the secondary winding can be known from Equations (9) and (28), as follows:\nILS(Max)= ILP(Max)\u00d7 1\n(1 + N) =\n[ VM (1 + Nd Bo)\nR(1 \u2212 dBo) + VDCdBoT LP\n] \u00d7 1\n(1 + N) (29)\nIn step-up mode, the maximum current stress on the switch SBo1 is the same as that of the primary winding, expressed as follows:\nIds, Bo(Max)= ILP(Max) = VM (1 + Nd Bo)\nR(1 \u2212 dBo) + VDCdBoT LP\n(30)\nAdditionally, when the diode DBo is conducting, its maximum current stress is the same as that of the secondary winding, expressed as follows:\nIDBo(Max)= ILS(Max) = [\nVM (1 + Nd Bo) R(1 \u2212 dBo) + VDCdBoT LP\n] \u00d7 1\n(1 + N) (31)\nAssuming that the output high-frequency current ripple can be completely filtered out and ignored, the current stresses of the switches SBu1, SBu2, SBu3, SBu4, and the inductor LS are the same as the output current, and their maximum values can be expressed as follows:\nIds, Bu1(Max)= Ids, Bu2(Max)= Ids, Bu3(Max)= Ids, Bu4(Max)= IL f (Max) = VM\nR (32)\n4.4. Selection of the Output Filter\nWhen the converter operates in step-down mode, the full-bridge unfolding circuit is controlled by SPWM, and the inductor Lf is used for energy storage. The boundary inductance of Lf can be expressed as follows:\nL f (B) = R \u00d7 (1 \u2212 dBu1)T\n2 (33)\nThe inverter can operate in the CCM of step-down mode by selecting the inductance of Lf to be greater than the boundary inductance Lf(B). In addition, the inductor Lf and the capacitor Cf are used as a low-pass filter in step-up mode, and its cut-off frequency fc can be expressed as:\nfc = 1 2\u03c0 \u221a L f C f (34)\nOnce the inductance of Lf is determined, the capacitance of Cf can be designed on the basis of Equation (34) according to the desired cut-off frequency.\n5. Experimental Results\nTo verify the feasibility of the proposed high-gain inverter, an experimental prototype was built according to the electrical specifications listed in Table 2. The prototype was tested using input voltages between 100 V and 200 V, in order to verify that the proposed inverter is suitable for PV panels with wide-range voltage variations. Additionally, the output voltage was selected as 220 Vrms in order to prove the high boosting capacity of the proposed inverter."

Conclusions A high-gain and high-efficiency inverter with magnetic coupling was successfully developed and implemented. The digital signal processor dsPIC33FJ16GS504 was used to generate the gate-driving signals of the proposed inverter, which can simplify the complexity of the control circuit and improve the reliability. As the instantaneous output voltage changes, the proposed circuit sequentially operates in step-down and step-up modes. In each operation mode, only one energy processing is required to obtain the desired output voltage. In addition, to significantly reduce switching losses, conversion efficiency can be effectively improved because part of the energy is delivered directly to the output load. Additionally, by adding a coupled inductor to the boost circuit, the voltage gain of the proposed inverter can be increased, so that it is suitable for applications with low input voltage.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, C.-H.C.; methodology, C.-H.C.; software, E.-C.C.; validation, E.-C.C.; formal analysis, C.-H.C.; investigation, H.-L.C.; resources, C.-A.C.; data curation, C.A.C.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, H.-L.C.; writing\u2014review and editing, C.-H.C.; visualization, H.-L.C.; supervision, C.-H.C.; project administration, C.-H.C.; funding acquisition, C.-A.C.
