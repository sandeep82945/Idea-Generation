A possible mechanism involving radical addition and\ncyclization following aromatization was proposed.\nAs an important nitrogen-containing heterocycle, isoquinolinone is widely found in natural products, pharmaceutical agents, and biologically active molecules.1 Therefore, the methods of efficient construction of isoquinolinones have attracted extensive attention. In recent years, the transition metals, including rhodium,2 ruthenium,3 palladium,4 nickel,5 cobalt,6\nand so on, have been able to catalyze C\u2013H bond activation inter-/intramolecular [4+2] cycloaddition reaction of benzamides and alkynes affording straight forward methods to construct substituted isoquinolinones (Scheme 1a).7 In addition, the research groups of Ackermann,8a,b Lei,8c and others developed a dual catalytic approach to synthesize isoquinolinones by combination of metal catalysis and electrosynthesis.8\nAs a safe, inexpensive, abundant, and nonpolluting energy source, visible light has attracted extensive attention.9 Recently, interests in visible-light photoredox catalysis have provided a number of approaches for C\u2013N bond formation.10 The difunctionalization of olefins initiated by a nitrogen radical is a direct strategy to construct molecules containing a nitrogen heterocycle.11\nHowever, because of the strong bond energy of alkynes and the\ninstability of vinyl radicals derived from radical additions, there are few examples of the synthesis of nitrogen heterocycles using difunctionalization of alkynes initiated by a nitrogen radical.12\nThe development of methods for the difunctionalization of alkynes is still highly desirable.\nIn our previous work,13 an amidyl radical intermediate generated from hydroxylamines has been studied for visible light-catalyzed diastereodivergent intramolecular oxyamination of alkenes and intramolecular unactivated C(sp3)\u2013H amination\nScheme 1 Synthesis of isoquinolinone derivatives via metal-catalysis and photocatalysis.\na Center of Chemistry for Frontier Technologies, Department of Chemistry, Zhejiang\nUniversity, Hangzhou, 310027, China.

The photoinduced synthesis of isoquinolinones from N-amidepyridinium and alkynes was reported by Xia and co-workers in 2020 (Scheme 1b).14 However, there are still some challenges: (1) it is difficult to control the regioselectivity based on unsymmetrical alkynes. (2) There is no construction of polycyclic structures, which are widely found in nature products.15 (3) The reaction is limited to aryl alkynes, and the results using terminal alkynes and alkyl alkynes have not been discussed. Alternatively, intramolecular [4+2] reactions can avoid the problem of regioselectivity for the construction of complex polycyclic structures. Here, we report a visible-light-promoted intramolecular radical-type cycloaddition of alkynes with benzamide to construct isoquinolinone skeletons (Scheme 1c).\nAt the beginning of our study by using 2-methylbut-3-yn-2-yl benzoyl(benzoyloxy)carbamate 1a as a model substrate, DIPEA as an electron sacrificial donor, and MeCN as a solvent at 50 1C under the irradiation of an 18 W cold fluorescent lamp (CFL), a variety of photocatalysts were screened (Table S1 in ESI\u2020). The reaction using fac-Ir(ppy)3 as a photocatalyst without DIPEA could occur smoothly (entry 1, Table 1). After the optimization of the solvents (entries 1\u201312, Table 1), the reaction using DMSO as a solvent could give 2a in 64% yield (entry 12). Using 5 W blue LEDs at 60 1C, the reaction could deliver 2a in 88% yield (entries 13 and 14). Based on these results, the standard reaction conditions were determined. Specifically, benzoyl(benzoyloxy)carbamate 1 with 2 mol% of Ir(ppy)3 in DMSO (0.05 M) were stirred at 60 1C under 5 W blue LEDs for 12 h.\nThe scope of alkyne carboamination was investigated under the standard conditions (Scheme 2). The substrates (1b\u20131e) with electron-withdrawing and electron-donating substituents could be converted into alkyne carboamination products in\n70\u201379% yields. The substrate containing naphthalen-1-yl could give 2f in 52% yield. Other heterocycles, such as indole (2g) and thiophene (2h), could give 62\u201364% yields. The dimethyl group in the substrate can be replaced by diethyl, cyclopentyl, cyclohexyl, and menthol derivatives (2i\u20132m). The reactions of the internal alkyne derivative 1n gave carbo-amination products in 77% yield. For aryl-terminal alkynes, the reaction only gave trace product. Secondary alcohol derivatives could be transformed to 2o and 2p in 26% and 33% yield, respectively.\nThe 5 mmol-scale reaction of 1a could be conducted to afford 2a in 79% yield (Scheme 3a). To further investigate the mechanism of the reaction, a control experiment was conducted. When 3 equivalents of radical inhibitor TEMPO ((2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidin-1-yl)oxidanyl) were added under the standard reaction conditions, the reaction was almost inhibited (Scheme 3b). This result indicated that the reaction process might contain a radical-initiated process. Prop-2-yn-1yl(benzoyloxy)carbamate 3 could give alkyne oxyamination product 4 in 15% NMR yield under the standard conditions (Scheme 3c). The product configuration was determined by the nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE).

The light-on-off experiment demonstrated that the radical chain mechanism was less likely involved (Scheme 3d).\nThe quantum yield of this reaction was 1 (see in ESI\u2020), so the radical chain mechanism was less likely involved.\nBased on the above experimental results and previously reported literature using photo-/electro-catalysis to construct azaheterocycles,11,16 a possible reaction mechanism was proposed (Scheme 4). Firstly, the substrate 1a could be reduced by PC* species generated by photoexcitation of the visible light photocatalyst to generate the high valence photocatalyst PC+\nand afford the radical ion intermediate, which might undergo O\u2013N bond cleavage to form a distonic radical ion A and benzoic acid anion. The intramolecular addition reaction between the nitrogen radical intermediate A and the alkyne gave the enyl radical intermediate B. Subsequently, the enyl radical intermediate B underwent intramolecular cyclization to give the aryl radical intermediate C. This intermediate could undergo\none-electron oxidation by PC+ and dehydrogenation to afford 2a and regenerate PC simultaneously.\nIn summary, by using the visible-light-promoted intramolecular carboamination of alkynes, we developed an alternative way to construct aryl and heterocycle polycyclic isoquinolinone derivatives. Both terminal and alkyl substituted alkynes could be tolerated. This reaction could be easily scaled up to 5 mmol. Control experiments and light-on-off experiments indicated that the reaction process might contain a radical-initiated process and the radical chain mechanism was less likely involved.\nFinancial support was provided by NSFC (22271249); the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (226- 2022-00224); Center of Chemistry for Frontier Technologies; and iChemFoundry, ZJU-Hangzhou Global Scientific and Technological Innovation Center."
