(C, D) Overall survival (OS) and recurrence free survival (RFS) curve of LUAD patients stratified by EGFR, RBM10, and TP53 mutations from the indicated cohorts (C) and by RBM10 expression estimated by immunohistochemistry (IHC) of LUAD tissue microarray (TMA) (D). Number of patients was indicated in parenthesis in (C). P values were calculated by log-rank tests. (E) Representative images of RBM10 immunohistochemistry analysis of TMA LUAD samples, with high or low immunoreactive score (IRS) of RBM10. Scale bar: 100\u03bcm for 4\u00d7magnification, and 50\u03bcm for 20\u00d7magnification.

Impacts of RBM10 expression on target splicing, response to spliceosome inhibitor and the growth of LUAD cells. (A) Confirmation of the splicing changes following RBM10 knockout using two independent single guide RNAs in BEAS-2B cells. Relative expression of RBM10 was shown. Loading control: GAPDH.
