    "abstractText": "9 In this study, the energy flux of sputtered atoms on a substrate was correlated to the properties 10 of titanium nitride (TiN) films deposited using direct current magnetron sputtering (dcMS) under 11 mixed Ar and N2 atmospheres. The neutral titanium sputtered atoms velocity distribution func12 tions (AVDFs) were measured by tunable diode-laser induced fluorescence (TD-LIF), and the flux 13 of particles and their energy were derived. Mass spectrometry was used to characterize the 14 energy-resolved flux of the ions. It was found that the neutral sputtered atoms flux and deposi15 tion rate were in good agreement, indicating that the flux of the neutral titanium ground state 16 represents the number of deposited atoms. Moreover, TiN films were deposited at different gas 17 pressures and at various Ar/N2 gas mixtures close to the conditions where stoichiometric TiN 18 was formed, without bias voltage and heating of the substrates. The energy flux of the sputtered 19 neutral Ti into the substrate was calculated from TD-LIF measurements. At a relatively low mag20 netron discharge pressure of 0.4 Pa, we demonstrated that the energy of sputtered neutral Ti 21 impinging on the substrate is higher than the energy flux of ionized particles corresponding 22 mainly to Ar+. Thus, the influence of the energy flux of the sputtered atoms on the texture and 23 microstructure of the films is revealed. The (200) texture was obtained at 0.4 Pa when the energy 24 flux of the sputtered atoms was higher than the ion energy flux. At 1.3 Pa where the sputtered 25 atoms energy flux is one order lower compared to 0.4 Pa the (111) texture was obtained. The 26 high-energy flux of the ground state of Ti sputtered atoms seems to allow stress removal in the 27 films. 28",

The neutral titanium sputtered atoms velocity distribution func-12 tions (AVDFs) were measured by tunable diode-laser induced fluorescence (TD-LIF), and the flux 13 of particles and their energy were derived. Mass spectrometry was used to characterize the 14 energy-resolved flux of the ions. It was found that the neutral sputtered atoms flux and deposi-15 tion rate were in good agreement, indicating that the flux of the neutral titanium ground state 16 represents the number of deposited atoms. Moreover, TiN films were deposited at different gas 17 pressures and at various Ar/N2 gas mixtures close to the conditions where stoichiometric TiN 18 was formed, without bias voltage and heating of the substrates. The energy flux of the sputtered 19 neutral Ti into the substrate was calculated from TD-LIF measurements. At a relatively low mag-20 netron discharge pressure of 0.4 Pa, we demonstrated that the energy of sputtered neutral Ti 21 impinging on the substrate is higher than the energy flux of ionized particles corresponding 22 mainly to Ar+. Thus, the influence of the energy flux of the sputtered atoms on the texture and 23 microstructure of the films is revealed. The (200) texture was obtained at 0.4 Pa when the energy 24 flux of the sputtered atoms was higher than the ion energy flux. At 1.3 Pa where the sputtered 25 atoms energy flux is one order lower compared to 0.4 Pa the (111) texture was obtained. The 26 high-energy flux of the ground state of Ti sputtered atoms seems to allow stress removal in the 27 films. 28\nKeywords: dcMS, diode laser-induced fluorescence spectroscopy, TiN microstructure and tex-29 ture. 30\nI. Introduction 31\nIn magnetron sputtering (MS), the growth of polycrystalline thin films begins with vapor condensation 32 on the substrate surface, which nucleates into islands and consolidates to form a continuous film. Thin 33 films and coatings are used in a wide range of technological applications including microelectronics, 34 optical devices, and surface protection. The performance of thin films and coatings depends on their 35 physical properties, which are governed by film morphology and phase composition. These properties 36 depend on the interactions of the particles with the substrate. Thus, the energy and flux of atoms and 37 ions arriving at the substrate are of major importance for tailoring the forming film properties, such 38\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 A cc pt ed M a us cr ip t\nPage 2\nas microstructure, stress, adhesion, electrical resistivity, stoichiometry, and crystalline properties. Ti-1 tanium nitride (TiN) was used in this study because of its excellent mechanical and optical properties, 2 and it has been used in several applications, such as decorative and wear-resistance [1,2]. 3\nMagnetron sputtering is a physical vapor deposition technique that can be operated with different 4 power supplies: direct current magnetron sputtering (dcMS) to sputter conductive targets, radiofre-5 quency magnetron sputtering primarily used to deposit dielectric materials, and high-power impulse 6 magnetron sputtering (HiPIMS) [3,4]. In the dcMS process, most of the sputtered species remain in a 7 neutral state, and their energy is controlled by the degree of thermalization, i.e., the number of colli-8 sion events between the sputtered species and the processing gas. The number of collisions can be 9 directly controlled by the deposition pressure and the target-to-substrate distance [5]. Their energy 10 ranges from the energy they gain in the sputtering process and at virtually no collisions (~ 3.2 eV in 11 average) to fully thermalized species at a larger number of collisions (~0.1 eV in average). Over the last 12 two decades, HiPIMS has been intensively studied because of its ability to generate sputtered atoms 13 with a high ionization rate (a few tens of percent). Such pulsed plasma discharges work at a peak 14 current of approximately two orders of magnitude (low duty cycle: 1 % and low repetition frequency: 15 < 5 kHz) compared with dcMS. 16\nIn conventional dcMS to deposit nitride thin films, the ion flux on the substrate mainly contains buffer 17 gas ions (Ar+ and N2+), whereas the sputtered species are mainly in a neutral state. For titanium nitride 18 (TiN) deposition, the energy flux on the substrate, i.e., the product of particle flux and incident particle 19 energy determines the growth mode. The TiN grains are preferentially oriented along the [111] direc-20 tion for low energy flux, while [200] preferred orientation is observed for high energy flux [1,2,6,7]. 21 Compared with ions, it is challenging to characterize energetic neutral-sputtered atoms. Their energy 22 flux can be measured by mass spectrometry, a retarding field analyzer, and a Faraday cup, but the 23 atoms must be ionized for detection [8]. Other devices have been developed and proposed to measure 24 the energy flux towards the substrate surface without the ionization of incoming species as calorimet-25 ric probes [9\u201311]. In addition, both ions and neutral metallic flux towards the substrate were simulated 26 by Mahieu and Depla [12] using the Monte Carlo approach of the SIMTRA code. 27\nTunable diode laser-induced fluorescence (TD-LIF) is a powerful technique for diagnosing neutral sput-28 tered atoms with high spatial and spectral resolution, and the plasma remains practically unperturbed 29 in terms of temperature and density [5,13\u201316]. Moreover, these measurements have numerous ad-30 vantages compared to other optical diagnostics: (1) they allow probing of the ground state of the 31 sputtered atoms in dcMS, (2) they are highly space and spectrally resolved, and (iii) they allow meas-32 urement of the flux and energy of sputtered atoms at the substrate position in front of the target. 33 Other optical plasma diagnostics can be found in the literature, allowing the sputtered atom velocity 34 distribution function (AVDFs) description [17\u201319]. 35\nMany previous works have studied TiN coatings deposited using either dcMS [1] or HiPIMS processes 36 [6,7,20\u201322], and most of these studies investigated the impact of ion flux on the properties of TiN 37 films. The present study aims to correlate the energy flux of neutral sputtered atoms on a substrate 38 with the properties of TiN thin films (film texture, microstructure, and morphology) grown in dcMS 39 discharges where the sputtered particles are mainly neutral. To achieve this goal, we used a balanced 40 magnetron to reduce the ion flux on the substrate without bias and without intentional substrate 41 heating. Thus, simultaneous measurements of TD-LIF and mass spectrometry of magnetron discharge 42\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 A cc ep te d M a\nsc rip\nt\nPage 3\nunder different gas mixtures (Ar/N2) were performed to characterize the energy flux of neutral sput-1 tered Ti atoms and the ion energy flux, respectively. 2"

Using mechanical and turbomolecular pumps, the base pressure 5 obtained was approximately 2\u00d710-4 Pa. A titanium target, 50 mm in diameter, 3 mm in thickness, and 6 99.99 % pure, was installed on a 2-inches balanced magnetron cathode cooled by water. The power 7 source was a MELEC SIPP 2000 power supply (Umax =1 kV; Imax_peak= 200 A). The reactive gas mixture 8 (Ar and N2) was added to the chamber at various N2/(Ar+N2) flow rate ratios, and the total flow rate 9 was maintained at 18 sccm. We investigated the gas mixture range of 2 % to 5 % N2 where quasi 10 stochiometric TiN films were formed as shown latter by the measurements of the chemical composi-11 tion of the films, the same conditions were found in early work with another deposition system [23]. 12 For all the results presented in this work, the average power was fixed at 5 W cm-2 (100 W for the 13 target area). In addition, all plasma measurements and thin film depositions were performed at a tar-14 get-to-substrate distance of 5 cm (figure 1). 15\nPlasma diagnostics and film depositions were performed in the same reactor, and the (100)-oriented 16 Si substrates were installed using configuration 2, where the magnetron cathode was installed atop 17 the chamber [figure 1 (b)]. No substrate bias or external heating was applied to the substrate during 18 the film growth.

The reader can refer to Desecures et al. [15] for 8 a detailed description of the TD-LIF experimental setup. The laser source used in this study was a tun-9 able diode laser (Toptica Photonics DL 100), which was accorded to probe the transition from 10 3d2s2 (3F2) to 3d2 (3F) 4s4p (1Po) of the ground state of neutral titanium sputtered atoms (\u03bb0=398.17 11 nm). The diode laser was tuned to scan a 9 pm wavelength range with a locked single-mode, and the 12 spectral resolution was 0.005 pm, enabling an accurate description of the Doppler broadening profile. 13 The typical scanning frequency for measurements was 50 Hz. The probed volume in the TD-LIF meas-14 urements was approximately 3 mm3 above the racetrack center, that is, at r=1.25 cm and z = 5 cm 15 (figure 1(a)). The combination of high spectral and spatial resolutions accurately measures the flux and 16 energy of the deposited species. 17\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\n60 A cc ep te\nd\nM an us cr ip t\nPage 5\nThe ion energy distribution functions (IEDFs) of Ar+ and N2+ were measured using a HIDEN EQP 300 1 instrument. The plasma was sampled by a grounded orifice of a 100 m diameter mass spectrometer 2 installed in the virtual position of the substrate (figure 1(a)). Because the mass spectrometer signal 3 depends on the differences in the acceptance angle for different ion energies and the unknown trans-4 fer function of the mass spectrometer, the measurements do not represent the absolute values of the 5 ion flux; therefore, we discuss only the qualitative signal variations. Herein, only the qualitative 6 changes in terms of energy are discussed. However, owing to the reactor geometry, mass spectrome-7 try measurements were only performed in front of the target center at r= 0 cm (see figure 1). 8\nThe deposition rate was measured via scanning electron microscopy using a cross-sectional view of 9 the specimens. The microstructure (crystallite size) and preferred orientation of the films were char-10\nacterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis (Br\u00fcker D8 Advance with Cu K radiation, \u03bb=1.54056 \u00c5) in 11 Bragg-Brentano geometry (\u03b8-2\u03b8). This mode allows for the identification of planes parallel to the thin-12 film surface. The chemical composition of the films was determined by wavelength dispersive X-ray 13 spectroscopy (WDS), also known as electron probe microanalysis (EPMA), using a JEOL JXA-8530F in-14 strument. Ti, Fe4N, and MgO were used as standards to measure the Ti, N, and O concentrations, 15 respectively. For each sample, the reported chemical composition was obtained by averaging 50 dif-16 ferent spots measured on the surface (~ 200 \u00d7 200 \u03bcm2). The topography and RMS roughness of the 17 TiN films were investigated in resonant mode using a nano-observer atomic force microscope (AFM) 18 developed by CSInstruments. 19"

Correlation between the deposited flux and deposition rate 21\nFigure 2 shows the neutral Ti (3F2) AVDFs in dcMS discharge at 0.4 and 1.3 Pa, for the different gas 22 mixtures (N2/Ar). We used the resonance fluorescence signal (\u03bblaser = \u03bblif = 398.17 nm), which signifi-23 cantly improved the TD-LIF signal compared with previous studies [5,16]. Then, the AVDF profiles and 24 the atoms populations are accurately described: thermalized (centered at v = 0 km/s) and energetic [v 25 > 1 km/s \u22481 eV for titanium atoms] [5] are separated at relatively low and high magnetron pressures 26 (p=0.4 and 1.3 Pa). The dashed curves represent fitting of the TD-LIF signal. The measured velocity 27 field is the axial component (component perpendicular to the target surface as shown in figure 1 (a)), 28 and two Gaussian functions were used to fit the experimental signal, which corresponded to the ther-29 malized and energetic atoms populations. Because the measurements were carried out 5 cm away 30 from the target, sputtered atoms undergo collision with the buffer gas, inducing the energetic popu-31 lation to be better fitted by a Gaussian function instead of the commonly known Thompson function 32 [24]. The fitting by these two Gaussians results in some discrepancy for negative velocity (v < 0), espe-33 cially at low pressure (0.4 Pa, top panel of figure 2). The main goal of the fitting is to better calculate 34 the flux and energy of the atoms with momentum towards the substrate (positive velocity) to correlate 35 with the film properties. Only the measurements performed at the substrate position are shown at a 36 distance z = 5 cm from the target. For a detailed description of the AVDFs' fitting and titanium sput-37 tered atoms transport characterization combined with PIC Monte Carlo modeling in argon gas, the 38 reader is referred to Revel et al.

Dashed curves are the fitting of 3 the measured signal. 4\nThe addition of nitrogen to the argon discharge completely altered the sputtering process. N2 mole-5 cules react with the target surface material, forming a nitride layer that induces variations in secondary 6 electron emission, electron temperature, and cathode voltage, but also induces variations in the ions 7 striking the cathode, that is, Ar+, N2+, and N+ allowing sputtering instead of only Ar+ in pure Ar gas. 8 Figure 2 shows that the TD-LIF signal at the substrate positioned at a distance z = 5 cm from the target 9 decreased progressively with increasing N2 content. This decrease was observed for all atoms regard-10 less of their energy. This is due to two main changes: (i) poisoning of the target surface in which the 11 binding energy of Ti-N (8.04 eV [25]) is higher than that of Ti-Ti ones (6.6 eV [26]) and (ii) plasma 12 variation in which the N+ and N2+ ions can be less efficient for sputtering compared to the Ar+ ion [27]. 13 TD-LIF measurements performed near to the target surface (z= 1.1 cm) at low pressure of 0.4 Pa show 14 that the surface nitridation affects the surface binding energy, we measured an average energy of 15 4.0\u00b10.2 eV at nitride mode and 3.2\u00b10.2 eV in metallic mode (100% Ar). The gas mixture does not affect 16 the temperature of thermalized sputtered atoms since they are in thermal equilibrium with the buffer 17 gas. In terms of the energy of the sputtered atoms, an expected difference can be observed when the 18 gas pressure is increased; thermalized atoms are increased at a relatively high pressure (p=1.3 Pa) 19\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n1.5\n2.0\n2.5\n3.0\n0 2 4 6\n0\n3\n6\n9\n12\n15\nT D\n-L IF\ns ig\nn a l (  1\n0 1\n2 s m\n-4 )\n0% N2 1% N2 5% N2 10% N2 100% N2\n0.4 Pa\n1.3 Pa\nAxial velocity (km/s)\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\n60 A cc pt ed\nM\nan us cr ip t\nPage 7\ncompared to the energetic atoms.

Figure 3 (a) shows that the parameters, i.e., the flux of sputtered atoms 9\nand the deposition rate, are in good agreement. 10\nBecause the TD-LIF measurements were performed on the lower level of the ground state (J = 2), we 11 assumed that neutral titanium atoms are in Boltzmann equilibrium and calculated the absolute value 12 of the flux of ground-state titanium atoms as 13\n\u0424absolute(cm \u22122 s\u22121 ) = \u0424\ud835\udc5a {1 + \u2211\n\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc3d \ud835\udc54\ud835\udc5a exp (\u2212 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc3d\u2212\ud835\udc38\ud835\udc5a \ud835\udc58B\ud835\udc47 )\ud835\udc5a\u22121\ud835\udc3d=1 }, (2) 14\nwhere EJ and gJ are the energy and statistical weight, respectively, of state J and kB is the Boltzmann 15 constant. The titanium ground state has a triplet structure, in which the levels J = 2, 3, and 4 are at 16 energies of 0, 0.021, and 0.047 eV, respectively. Therefore, Eq. (2) simplifies to 17\n\u0424absolute(cm \u22122 s\u22121 ) = \u0424\ud835\udc3d=2 {1 +\n\ud835\udc543 \ud835\udc542 exp (\u2212 \ud835\udc383\u2212\ud835\udc382 \ud835\udc58B\ud835\udc47 ) + \ud835\udc544 \ud835\udc542 exp (\u2212 \ud835\udc384\u2212\ud835\udc382 \ud835\udc58B\ud835\udc47 )}. (3) 18\nThe temperature of the thermalized atoms was used to calculate the absolute flux of the Ti atoms. The 19 absolute flux and deposition rates are shown in figure 3 (b). The flux of Ti atoms reaching the substrate 20 at 2 % N2 and p = 0.4 Pa was 6.8\u00d71014 cm-2 s-1 and decreased to 5\u00d71014 cm-2 s-1 when 5 % N2 was added 21 to the gas mixture. Similarly, the deposition rate decreased from 1700 to 1350 nm h-1 when the gas 22 mixture varied from 2 to 5 % N2. By increasing the pressure p= 1.3 Pa, a slight decrease in the deposi-23 tion rate and Ti atoms flux was measured compared to p=0.4 Pa. The influence of the gas mixture was 24 similar at both pressures. These variations show good agreement between the flux and the deposition 25 rate for the 0.4 and 1.3 Pa pressures used in this work. In fact, increasing the percentage of nitrogen 26 induces poisoning of the target and decreases the number of sputtered titanium atoms, resulting in a 27 corresponding decrease in the deposition rate. In the studied pressure range, the pressure variation 28 slightly affected the deposition rate, whereas the sputtered atoms thermalization increased signifi-29 cantly when the pressure increased (figure 2). 30\n31\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 A cc ep\nd M\nan us\ncr ip\nt\nPage 8\n1\n2\nFigure 3.

Influence of deposited energy on the film microstructure, texture, and morphology 1\nAs mentioned in the experimental section, TiN films were deposited in the dcMS discharge without 2 any heating or bias of the substrate. The Ar gas temperature was measured as a function of the dis-3 tance from the target using tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy. It reaches a high 4 temperature of 1400 K near the target (z = 1.3 cm), but a low temperature of approximately 500 K was 5 measured at z = 5 cm [5]. Under these conditions, the total energy flux towards the substrate is the 6 sum of the different contributions due to the kinetic energy of different deposited species. This section 7 reports the different contributions. 8\nIn dcMS using a balanced magnetron, the plasma is trapped close to the target surface, in which the 9 ion flux into the substrate decreases [4]. Figure 4 shows the IEDFs of Ar+ and N2+ at 0.4 Pa and 3 %N2 10 in gas mixture. The mass spectrometer signal represents the flux of ions, and two groups of ions arrive 11 at the substrate: the low-energy group (E < 6 eV) and high-energy group (E around 20 eV). The low-12 energy group of ions is thermalized with the buffer gas. The high-energy group has been studied in 13 many works, especially in HiPIMS discharge [28\u201330], and is generally attributed to ion acceleration 14 inside spokes in magnetron plasma. As shown in figure 4, the signal magnitude of this high-energy 15 group is three orders of magnitude lower than that of the thermalized ions. Thus, to calculate the 16 energy flux towards the substrate, only low-energy ions were considered. In an early study of Ar/N2 17 magnetron discharge, Petrov et al. [23] demonstrated that Ar+ ions are the primary ions incident on 18 the substrate in Ar-N2 dcMS discharges, with a flux accounting for more than 92 % of the total ion flux 19 when the percentage of N2 was lower than 15 %. It worth to mention herein that ours mass spectrom-20 eter measurements are not calibrated. Thus, the corresponding ion energy flux to the substrate is 21 calculated using the following expression [31]: 22\n\u0424\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc52\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc54\ud835\udc66, \ud835\udc34\ud835\udc5f+( \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc4a cm \u22122) =\n1\n4 \ud835\udc52 \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc63\ud835\udc56 \ud835\udc49 (4) 23\nwhere ni and vi are the ion density and thermal ion velocity, e is the electron charge and V is the voltage 24 drop in the substrate sheath. Bradley et al [32] measured the ions density in dcMS with a cathode of 25 15 cm in diameter, 0.26 Pa argon pressure, and a dc power of about 1.5 W cm-2, they found an ions 26 density of about 1016 m-3 at z= 5 cm. In ours deposition system at z = 5 cm away from the target and 27 PDC =5 W cm-2, we assumed an ion density of 2\u00d71016 m-3 and an ion temperature of 600 K [5]. Based 28 on our mass spectrometer measurements of the thermalized ions (figure 4), the voltage drop at the 29 substrate sheath was estimated to be 3 V. For these plasma parameters, the energy flux corresponding 30 to the ion contributions (equation 4) is approximately 0.075 mW cm-2. 31\nRegarding the energy flux of the electron contribution, the energetic secondary electrons accelerated 32 in the cathode sheath are trapped near the cathode surface for ionization by the magnetic field, and 33 only thermalized electrons can reach the substrate. Our substrate was grounded, and because the 34 plasma potential at z = 5 cm was positive, the thermalized electrons were pushed away from the sub-35 strate. Therefore, their energy flux contributions can be neglected. 36\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 A cc t\nd M\nan us\ncr pt\nPage 10\n1\nFigure 4.

The total energy flux of the 6 ground state Ti atoms was then deduced by applying equation (3). Figure 5 shows the variations in the 7 energy flux of the ground state of the neutral Ti atoms and Ar+ ions as a function of the nitrogen per-8 centage. At p = 0.4 Pa, the energy flux gradually decreases from 0.27 to 0.20 mW cm-2 when the 9 nitrogen percentage increases from 2 to 5 %. This decrease was mainly due to the decrease in the 10 number of Ti-neutral atoms reaching the substrate. However, at p = 1.3 Pa, where the vapor is more 11 thermalized, the energy flux is one order of magnitude lower than that measured at 0.4 Pa. It is on the 12 order of 0.03 mW cm-2. The most important result is that the energy flux of sputtered Ti atoms is 13 higher than that of Ar+ ions at a low magnetron pressure of 0.4 Pa. Other sputtered species, such as 14 nitrogen atoms (N), could contribute to the energy flux towards the substrate, and its behavior as a 15 function of pressure is expected to be similar to that of neutral Ti atoms. The knowledge of their en-16 ergy flux requires further investigation. In other deposition system, Gauter et al. [33] used direct 17 calorimetric probe to characterize the energy flux on the substrate during the deposition by HiPIMS 18\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\n60 A cc ep t d M\nan us cr ip t\nPage 11\ndischarge with copper magnetron, they measured an averaged energy flux of 20 mW cm-2.

[34] to energy flux during the deposition of ZnO by a radio-2 frequency discharge of 15 W cm-2 (3 target with 5 W cm-2), they found a total energy flux of 30 mW 3 cm-2. In those calorimetric probe experiments, the energy flux is higher than the obtained by our di-4 agnostics because (i) their measurements consider the contributions of all species arriving to the 5 substrate, (ii) the discharge power is higher than used in our work and (iii) the zinc and copper have 6 higher sputtering efficiency compared to titanium. 7\n8\nFigure 5.

All films exhibited characteristic diffraction peaks corre-7 sponding to polycrystalline TiN with a cubic (NaCl-type) structure. At 0.4 Pa, the thin films exhibit a 8 mixed orientation with the (111) and (200) planes. Other planes with negligible intensities were de-9 tected and are not shown here. At 0.4 Pa, we observed that the (111) and (200) planes co-existed, but 10 the peak corresponding to the (200) planes was highly dominant. At 1.3 Pa, we observed that the (111) 11 planes exhibited the highest intensity for all percentages of N2 investigated. We also observed the 12 quasi-absence of the (200) planes. The two preferred orientations have different surface energies. In 13 fact, the family of (111) planes has an atom density greater than that of (200) planes, thus inducing a 14 lower surface energy of the (111) planes. Therefore, we can consider that the latter are more stable 15 and require less energy to be produced than the (200) plane. Thus, the preferred (111) orientation is 16 the result of deposition under conditions close to equilibrium [6]. Because the TiN films were depos-17 ited at ambient temperature and without substrate bias, the texture variation could only be affected 18 by the energy flux of the arriving species and the chemical composition of the films. 19\n20\nFigure 6. \u03b8-2\u03b8 X-ray diffractograms of TiN films deposited by dcMS as a function of the percentage of N2 in the 21 gas mixture, at p = 0.4 Pa (left) and 1.3 Pa (right).

It should be noted that films with similar chemical compositions have different preferred 26\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59\n60 A cc\nep\nte d M a\nus c\nip t\nPage 13\norientations. The preferred orientation has been studied in many previous works on dcMS under dif-1 ferent energetic ion bombardment conditions [6,35\u201337], and it is well known that by increasing the ion 2 energy at the substrate, the preferred orientation switches from [111] to [200]. As shown in figure 5, 3 at a low pressure (0.4 Pa) we found that the energy flux of the ion contribution towards the substrate 4 is negligible, and the primary deposited energy that can affect the adatom is the energy flux of the 5 ground state of neutral Ti sputtered atoms. As the switching of preferred orientation from the [200] 6 to the [111] one occurs by switching the pressure from 1.3 to 0.4 Pa, we deduce that the energy flux 7 of the neutral sputtered species (Ti and N) enables the growth of films with [200] orientation. The 8 (200) preferred orientation is characterized by high hardness compared with the [111] orientation 9\n[7,20]. 10\nUsing X-ray diffractograms, the (111) and (200) peaks were adjusted using a Lorentzian function, and 11 the full width at half maximum (FWHM) was determined to estimate the crystallite size based on the 12 Scherrer formula [38]. The (111) peaks at 1.3 Pa were fitted with two Lorentzian functions because of 13 the asymmetry on the left of the peak, and the crystallite size was calculated from the FWHM of the 14 Lorentzian with the highest amplitude. The results are shown in figure 7 (a). There are two groups of 15 crystallites according to their size. A group of sizes of approximately 18 \u00b1 2 nm corresponding to the 16 crystallites oriented in the [100] direction normal to the substrate existing in the films at 0.4 Pa. The 17 second group had a crystallite size of approximately 5 \u00b1 2 nm among the remaining crystallites. 18 Recently, Viloan et al. [20] reported a high hardness of TiN crystallites with a large crystallite size. This 19 type of crystallite is obtained when the energy flux of the sputtered neutral is higher than the energy 20 flux of the ion contribution (figure 5). 21\n22\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 47 48 49 50 51 52 53 54 55 56 57 58 59 60 A cc ep te d M an us cr ip t\nPage 14\n1\n2\nFigure 7.

This was possible because the calibration of the 1 XRD instrument was performed using the (004) diffraction peak observed from the Si substrate for all 2 samples (figure 6). The films deposited at 0.4 Pa exhibit a lattice constant around 4.24 \u00c5. The lattice 3 constant of bulk TiN is 4.24 \u00c5 in the absence of stress. An increase in the nitrogen ratio in the gas 4 mixture from 2 % to 5 % induced a slight decrease in the lattice constant from 4.240 \u00c5 to 4.235 \u00c5. This 5 decrease may be related to a slight variation in the concentration of N in the film, which was not 6 detected by EPMA. However, for the films deposited at 1.3 Pa the lattice parameter was approximately 7 4.215 \u00c5, suggesting the presence of tensile stress in the films. As shown in figure 4, the energy flux of 8 sputtered Ti atoms at 0.4 Pa is one order of magnitude higher than at 1.3 Pa. Therefore, the high-9\nenergy flux of Ti atoms seems to allow stress removal in films at low pressures. 10\nAFM measurements were performed to determine the morphology and roughness of the film surfaces 11 (figure 8). The films deposited at 0.4, 1.3 Pa, and 3 % N2 with approximately similar thicknesses (~ 2.9 12 m) were characterized. The film deposited at low pressure exhibited a very high roughness (RMS 13 surface roughness = 67 nm). The surface of this film showed large faceted grains, in agreement with 14 the XRD results. On the other hand, the film deposited at 1.3 Pa show a lower roughness (RMS surface 15 roughness = 11 nm) and small grains. Once again, the difference in the film surface morphology may 16 be explained by the high energy flux of sputtered Ti atoms at 0.4 Pa. 17\n18\n19\nFigure 8.

The flux of 2 the sputtered particles was then calculated and correlated with the deposition rate. Their evolutions 3 as a function of the N2 content in the gas mixture are in good agreement. TiN thin films were deposited 4 at 0.4 and 1.3 Pa, for different gas mixtures Ar/N2 close to the conditions where stoichiometric TiN was 5 formed, without bias voltage and heating of the substrates. Their microstructure, texture, and chem-6 ical composition were characterized using X-ray diffraction, EPMA. The films deposited at a low 7 pressure (0.4 Pa) show a [200] preferred orientations. For 1.3 Pa, the films were oriented along the 8 [111] direction and tensile stress was observed. Because the film growth was carried out without bias 9 and heating of the substrate, we studied the influence of the energy flux (i.e., the product of particle 10 flux and incident particle energy) of sputtered atoms deduced from TD-LIF measurements on the film 11 properties. At a relatively low magnetron discharge pressure of 0.4 Pa, we found that the energy of 12 the ground state of sputtered neutral Ti impinging on the substrate is higher than the energy flux of 13 ionized particles corresponding mainly to Ar+. This high energy flux of sputtered neutral atoms allows 14 the growth of TiN oriented along the [111] direction. In addition, it allows stress removal in the films. 15 At 1.3 Pa where the sputtered atoms energy flux is one order lower compared to 0.4 Pa the (111) 16 texture was obtained. 17 18 Acknowledgments 19 The authors thank Mrs. Christine Gendarme and Mr. Denis Mangin from the Centre de Comp\u00e9tences 20\n3M of the Institut Jean Lamour for WDS analyse.
