    "abstractText": "Background. Adolescents are mostly considered as a healthy population; however, failure to acquire positive health behaviors during this period makes them vulnerable to poor health outcomes and long-term chronic disorders. Health literacy is one of the most influential parameters in promoting adolescent health. This study aimed to determine the level and promoters of health literacy in adolescents, emphasize the importance of internet use, and evaluate the relationship between self-efficacy and health literacy. Methods. A total of 756 adolescents aged 15 and 18 years attending two high schools in socioeconomically different districts in Ankara, Turkey were included in this cross-sectional study. A survey consisting of descriptive questions, a health literacy survey, and a general self-efficacy scale were used to collect data. p<0.05 was considered statistically significant. Results. Among the adolescents who participated in the study, the level of health literacy was inadequatelimited in 56.1%, sufficient in 30.1%, and excellent in 13.8%. A statistically significant correlation was found between health literacy and general self-efficacy levels (r: .412, p<0.001). There was also a statistically significant difference between the health literacy groups in terms of the education level of the adolescents\u2019 mothers, internet use frequency, and self-efficacy level. The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the participants whose mothers had only received primary school education or no formal education, those that were not using the internet regularly, those that did not search health information on the internet, and those with poor self-efficacy levels were more likely to have an inadequate level of health literacy [odds ratio (OR)=2.6, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.4-4.9; OR=5.5, 95% CI=1.2-25.1; OR=1.7, 95% CI=1.1-2.9; and OR=3.7, 95% CI=2.65.2, respectively]. Conclusions. In this study, it was concluded that the adolescents\u2019 health literacy and general self-efficacy levels were related. Furthermore, the health literacy level of the adolescents was associated with internet use and maternal education status.",

However, failure to acquire positive health behaviors during this period makes them vulnerable to poor health outcomes and longterm chronic disorders during both adolescence and adulthood.3 Furthermore, risky behaviors which frequently begin in adolescence, such as tobacco, alcohol and substance use, risky sexual behaviors, overeating, and lack of physical activity often lead to chronic diseases in adulthood.4,5 Promoting adolescent health is\nBackground. Adolescents are mostly considered as a healthy population; however, failure to acquire positive health behaviors during this period makes them vulnerable to poor health outcomes and long-term chronic disorders. Health literacy is one of the most influential parameters in promoting adolescent health. This study aimed to determine the level and promoters of health literacy in adolescents, emphasize the importance of internet use, and evaluate the relationship between self-efficacy and health literacy.\nMethods. A total of 756 adolescents aged 15 and 18 years attending two high schools in socioeconomically different districts in Ankara, Turkey were included in this cross-sectional study. A survey consisting of descriptive questions, a health literacy survey, and a general self-efficacy scale were used to collect data. p<0.05 was considered statistically significant.\nResults. Among the adolescents who participated in the study, the level of health literacy was inadequatelimited in 56.1%, sufficient in 30.1%, and excellent in 13.8%. A statistically significant correlation was found between health literacy and general self-efficacy levels (r: .412, p<0.001). There was also a statistically significant difference between the health literacy groups in terms of the education level of the adolescents\u2019 mothers, internet use frequency, and self-efficacy level. The multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that the participants whose mothers had only received primary school education or no formal education, those that were not using the internet regularly, those that did not search health information on the internet, and those with poor self-efficacy levels were more likely to have an inadequate level of health literacy [odds ratio (OR)=2.6, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.4-4.9; OR=5.5, 95% CI=1.2-25.1; OR=1.7, 95% CI=1.1-2.9; and OR=3.7, 95% CI=2.65.2, respectively].\nConclusions. In this study, it was concluded that the adolescents\u2019 health literacy and general self-efficacy levels were related. Furthermore, the health literacy level of the adolescents was associated with internet use and maternal education status.\nKey words: health literacy, adolescent, self-efficacy, internet use.\nDilara Ceylan mddilaradag@gmail.com\nReceived 19th April 2021, revised 3rd August 2021, accepted 18th August 2021.\nThe study presented as poster presentation at 7.

HL has a multidimensional construction, and it is defined as a combination of knowledge, motivation, and proficiency that allow people to access, understand, evaluate and use health information in order to improve their health, prevent diseases, and make decisions in everyday life to maintain or improve their health and quality of life.7 Adult studies have shown that differences in HL levels are related to increased emergency service visits and hospitalization, less use of preventive healthcare services, poor overall health status in the population over 65, and higher mortality.8 Although several adult studies have been conducted on HL, their results cannot be directly generalized to the pediatric population considering the different characteristics of childhood and especially adolescence. Limited adolescent research suggests that obesity, smoking, alcohol use, and drug abuse are related to low HL levels in adolescents.9,10\nAlthough HL plays an essential role in health behavior changes, such behaviors are also influenced by psychosocial factors, such as selfefficacy (SE).11 SE refers to an individuals\u2019 belief and confidence in their capacity to perform a specific behavior in diverse situations.12 High SE indicates more effort being made to attain desirable outcomes despite barriers; therefore, it is one of the crucial components of health promotion behaviors and a determinant for initiating and maintaining positive health behaviors.13 Additionally, SE has been exceptional for proper self-management for several chronic health conditions, such as diabetes and asthma.11,14 Furthermore, people with higher SE have been found to be exhibit more ambitious behavior to maintain a healthy diet for weight loss.15 Lastly, individuals with lower SE and HL are less likely to apply preventative health behaviors.16 However, despite these adult studies frequently reporting\nthe relationship between disease-based HL and SE status, there are still a limited number of adolescent studies in this area.\nThe internet is an essential tool for connecting with friends and one of the primary sources for almost every subject in the life of an adolescent.17 Therefore, internet-based health-related information seeking behavior of adolescents is increasingly being studied worldwide.18-20 The internet is easy to use, provides the fastest way to reach all types of information, and offers anonymity; therefore, it has been shown that adolescents prefer the internet as a primary source of health-related information rather than traditional health services.21 In addition, a previous study showed that more than two-thirds of adolescents accessed healthrelated information on the internet in the USA.22 This tendency can guide the design of developmentally relevant interventions that may support healthy lifestyle choices and promote HL among adolescents.23\nThis study aimed to determine the level of HL in adolescents, evaluate the relationship between SE and HL, and define significant promoters of HL, such as the internet among adolescents."

This scale was designed to measure an individual\u2019s subjective belief in her/himself in coping with stressful situations.

A univariate estimate was performed with the logistic regression analysis, and variables with a significance level of p < 0.05 in the univariate analysis were included in the multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine the association of each independent variable with outcome variables. The crude and adjusted odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) values were also obtained. p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant."

            "text": "In this study, we assessed adolescents\u2019 health promoters. For this purpose, we first measured the HL levels of the adolescents using THLS, which was adapted from HLS-EUS and can be used for both adolescents and adults.28 HLSEUS was designed to determine the HL level of individuals living in European Union countries and included 8,000 people from eight different countries. The results were challenging and showed an insufficient literacy level at 12%, with the overall rate of limited HL being calculated as 47%. These results suggested that every other person in Europe required an intervention to improve HL.30 In addition, THLS was administered in two adult studies in Turkey, and a limited HL level was found in 69.2% and 60% of the participants, respectively.28,31 Data obtained from different European countries showed that the rate of limited adolescent HL levels varied between 9.3% and 47.3%.32-35 Furthermore, if we compare the adequate HL levels in our study with those evaluated in an adult THLS study in Turkey, it is clear that the adequate HL level is seen at a higher rate in adolescents than in adults. Previous generations, especially individuals of advanced age have clear disadvantages in accessing internet-based health information. There may also be some loss of HL with senility.36 When we checked the data of the previous THLS study conducted in Turkey, a limited HL level was found in 63.3% of the participants aged 25-32 years and 66% of those aged 35-45 years.28 In our study, the rate of limited HL level was 56.1% among the adolescents. The loss ratio of HL was between 7.2 and 9.9%, even in young adults in Turkey. This can be explained by inadequate health policies and HL education. Decreasing HL levels during the transition from adolescence to adulthood indicate the need for new strategies to prevent this loss. Supporting and improving adolescent HL levels may inevitably have consequences not only for adolescence but also adulthood.\nIt is known that HL is influenced by different factors. Wharf et al.37 suggested a social-\necological model to understand the influencers of adolescent HL. This model included intrapersonal (characteristics, values, and experiences) and interpersonal (social support, groups, and family) factors. Concerning demographics, Levin-Zamir et al.38 and Pakkari et al.34 showed a positive correlation between higher HL and female sex in adolescents. Other adolescent HL studies also showed a significant relationship of HL with age.39,40 Although some studies support the link between HL and sociodemographic factors, a systematic review of adolescent HL data according to age and sex reported inconsistent results.6 Our study also showed that sex and age were not related to the HL levels of the adolescents. Also SE is considered to be one of the vital parts of intrapersonal factors, there are only a few studies in the literature reporting the relationship between HL and SE in adolescents.41,42 Nevertheless, disease-based (adult studies (such as asthma, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus) are more common and show that patients with chronic diseases require higher HL and SE levels for better disease control.43-46 We found a significant correlation between HL and general SE in healthy adolescents. Regarding the results of both adult and adolescent studies, we suggest that if higher SE levels can be achieved and maintained in adolescents, this may help increase their HL levels and ability to cope with chronic diseases in adulthood. However, further research is warranted to provide a better understanding of these aspects of adolescent"

In the current study, we found that both parents\u2019 education status affected adolescent HL, but our logistic model showed that only\nCeylan D, et al Turk J Pediatr 2022; 64(1): 110-121\nThe Turkish Journal of Pediatrics \u25aa January-February 2022118\nmaternal education status was truly effective in adolescents\u2019 HL. To our knowledge, this is the first study that emphasizes the relationship between maternal education status and their children\u2019s HL level. Although Levin-Zamir et al.37 showed a significant relationship between maternal education level and adolescent HL, paternal education level was not included as a parameter in their analysis. It is also known that children whose mothers\u2019 have higher education status have increased breastfeeding time and healthy nutrition habits, decreased obesity, and easy access to health services.53-55 Maternal education status affects many parameters in children\u2019s lives, and our study revealed that it also affected their HL levels.\nTylee et al.56 found that adolescents did not tend to seek any healthcare services unless their families asked them to because they feared that their confidentiality might not be protected by healthcare providers. A study designed by the OPINION research group investigated the primary sources of access to health information among the citizens of the European Union and reported that 55.7% of the individuals aged 15-24 years preferred the internet as a primary source, while only 26% of those aged 55 and over resorted to the internet for this purpose.57 Many United States studies have shown that the most searched health subjects via the internet are sexual activity, contraception, alcohol, sexually transmitted diseases, and drug use by adolescents.58,59 When we asked our participants about the most searched health-related subjects via the internet, we observed that this was the most popular question and received 2,879 responses. Contrary to the studies conducted in the United States, their most preferred subjects were less selected ones among the Turkish adolescents. Moreover, Ghaddar et al. found that the HL level was significantly higher in adolescents using https://medlineplus.gov/ (United States National Library of Medicine).41 Today, increased internet use in the presence of health problems suggests that the internet may be a suitable tool for promoting HL in adolescents\nwho use this technology very actively.60 In addition, in our study, using the internet more frequently and accessing health information through the internet were determined to be related to high HL levels in adolescents. Thus, although cultural differences affect adolescents\u2019 interest in health-related subjects, the current study confirmed that the internet was one of the most preferred and reliable sources of health information for adolescents.\nOur study had certain limitations. Although the validity and reliability analyses of the HL and SE scales were previously conducted, there is only limited research on the adolescent population and these scales were mainly designed for adults. Further studies should be conducted to support the use of these scales in the adolescent population. In addition, although most adolescents are students, some are employed and have their own families and children. Further studies should be planned to reach wider adolescent populations from different environments.\nIn line with our results, our recommendations are given below.\nFurther studies should be planned to measure and promote adolescent HL. HL should not be considered an independent issue, and studies should consider the relationship between HL and SE. Considering that adolescents are active internet users and use the internet as frequently as consulting doctors to seek healthrelated issues, the internet can be used as a powerful tool for improving HL in adolescents. Reliable sources suitable to the culture of the living environment should be provided under the supervision of healthcare specialists. Furthermore, one of the most critical findings of this study was the significant relationship between maternal education status and the adolescents\u2019 HL levels; thus, it is essential to support girls\u2019 education, especially in Turkey. This will not only support their future but also contribute to the protection and promotion of health in future generations.\nAdolescent Health Literacy\nThe Turkish Journal of Pediatrics \u25aa January-February 2022 119\nTurk J Pediatr 2022; 64(1): 110-121"
