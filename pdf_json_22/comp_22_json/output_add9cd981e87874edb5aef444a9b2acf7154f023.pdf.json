    "abstractText": "In this paper a time-fractional Black-Scholes model (TFBSM) is considered to study the price change of the underlying fractal transmission system. We develop and analyze a numerical method to solve the TFBSM governing European options. The numerical method combines the exponential B-spline collocation to discretize in space and a finite difference method to discretize in time. The method is shown to be unconditionally stable using von-Neumann analysis. Also, the method is proved to be convergent of order two in space and 2\u2212 \u03bc is time, where \u03bc is order of the fractional derivative. We implement the method on various numerical examples in order to illustrate the accuracy of the method, and validation of the theoretical findings. In addition, as an application, the method is used to price several different European options such as the European call option, European put option, and European double barrier knock-out call option.",

            "text": "In the market of finance, investors need to minimize and control risks. By market risks, we mean the chances of the deficit because of those aspects that impact the inclusive performance of the markets. Investors can manage these types of risks by investing in significant instruments that remove the risk of price volatility. Such instruments are known as financial derivatives. The value of a financial derivative depends on the functioning of the underlying asset. Among many financial derivatives, an option is one of the most well-known and important derivatives, so pricing an option is a significant problem both in practice and in theory. In 1973, Black and Scholes [1] and Merton [2] had proposed the Black-Scholes model, which gives an accurate delineation of the behavior of the underlying asset. Black-Scholes model is a second-order parabolic partial differential equation with respect to stock price and time, that governs the European option value on a stock,\nEmail addresses: anshima.singh.rs.mat18@iitbhu.ac.in (Anshima Singh)\nPreprint submitted to . July 20, 2022\nwhose price pursues the geometric Brownian motion with fixed interest rate and constant volatality. Since the Black-Scholes model is simple and effective to model option value, it led to a revolution in the financial market over the past several decades. The classical Black-Scholes model is given by [3, 4]\n\u2202V (\u03be, \u03c4) \u2202\u03c4 + \u03c32\u03be2 2 \u22022V (\u03be, \u03c4) \u2202\u03be2 + (rf \u2212DY )\u03be \u2202V (\u03be, \u03c4) \u2202\u03be \u2212 rfV (\u03be, \u03c4) = 0, (\u03be, \u03c4) \u2208 R+ \u00d7 (0, T\u0303 ), (1)\nwith the terminal condition\nV (\u03be, T\u0303 ) = max(\u03beT\u0303 \u2212 K\u0303, 0), \u03beT\u0303 \u2265 0, (2)\nwhere V (\u03be, \u03c4) denotes the value of a European option price. Here, \u03c3(\u03be, \u03c4), rf(\u03c4), DY (\u03c4), T\u0303 , K\u0303, and \u03c4 represent the volatility of the returns from the holding stock price \u03be, the risk free rate, the dividend yield, the expiry time, the exercise price, and the current time respectively. Several approaches have been proposed in the literature to obtain a solution to the classical Black-Scholes model [4\u20139]. Due to the unrealistic assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model, it has some drawbacks, so it cannot explain a few existing phenomena such as stock price volatility, a short time boom in the financial market. [10], etc.\nFractional integrals and fractional derivatives are non-local, so they are a useful tool to desribe memory. Fractional differential equations have become a powerful tool for studying fractal dynamics and fractal geometry. The fractional calculus has had a massive impact on financial theory, as the fractional Black Scholes model can deal with most of the shortcomings of the classical Black Scholes model. Wyss was the first researcher to introduce the time-fractional Black Scholes model for pricing a European call option [11]. To deal with the problem of short time jumps in the financial market, Cartea and delCastillo-Negrete [12] developed the space fractional Black-Scholes model to price exotic options. Jumarie [13, 14] applied Ito\u0302\u2019s lemma and the fractional-order Taylor\u2019s series method to obtain the time-space fractional Black-Scholes model. He studied the dynamics of the stock exchange and also considered Merton\u2019s optimal portfolio to provide new results. Liang et al. [15] derived a bi-fractional Black-Merton-Scholes model. With growth of applications of fractional models in financial field, researchers have shown interest in solving them analytically [16\u201320] and numerically [21\u201329].\nSpline functions are prevalent in mathematics, computer science, engineering, etc. [30\u2013 33]. The use of piecewise cubic polynomial spline interpolation often gives undesirable inflexion points. The exponential spline interpolation method is a generalization of cubic splines and avoids these inflexion points. Pruess [34, 35] showed that exponential splines can generate co-monotone and co-convex interpolants and provided the remedy to the inflexion points issue. Pruess [34], Boorm[36], and McCartin [37] studied the exponential splines in detail. McCartin also showed that the exponential splines accept a basis of B-splines. They are used in approximating the solutions of various classes of problems in differential equations [38\u201341].\nTo the best of our knowledge, there is no result in the literature on the collocation\nmethod based on exponential B-spline functions for the time-fractional Black-Scholes model. So, we propose an effective collocation technique to solve the time-fractional Black-Scholes problem numerically. To achieve this we use exponential B-spline functions to discretize the space derivative and apply a finite difference method to discretize the Caputo fractional derivative. It is proved that the method is unconditionally stable by means of von Neumann analysis. Further, it is shown that the proposed method is convergent of order O(h2\n\u03ba , h 2\u2212\u00b5 t ), where ht and h\u03ba represent mesh spacing in the time and\nspace directions, respectively. We perform several numerical experiments to validate the theoretical findings. We use the proposed method to price three European options governed by a TFBSM, namely the European call option, the European put option, and the European double barrier knock-out call option. In addition, we examine how the order of time-fractional derivative affects the option price.\nThe remaining paper is as structured follows. Section 2 describes the model problem. Section 3 is devoted to the proposed numerical method. The stability and convergence of the method are discussed in Sections 4 and 5 respectively. To validate our theoretical findings, several numerical examples are considered in Section 6. Finally, the paper is concluded in Section 7."

Also, without loss of generality we add a source term to the RHS of the equation (6). Thus, we have the following problem\nC 0 D \u00b5 t u(\u03ba, t) = \u03b1\n\u22022u(\u03ba, t)\n\u2202\u03ba2 +\u03b2\n\u2202u(\u03ba, t)\n\u2202x \u2212\u03b3u(\u03ba, t)+\u03c8(\u03ba, t), (\u03ba, t) \u2208 (Ip, Fp)\u00d7 (0, T\u0303 ), (8)\nwith   \nu(\u03ba, 0) = z(\u03ba), u(Ip, t) = H (t), u(Fp, t) = G (t),\n(9)\nwhere \u03b1 = \u03c3 2 2 > 0, \u03b2 = rf \u2212 \u03c3 2 2 , and \u03b3 = rf > 0. From the above fractional Black-Scholes model, we can obtain the widely known reaction-diffusion model by taking \u03b1 > 0, \u03b2 = 0, and \u03b3 6= 0, and the time fractional advection-diffusion model by taking \u03b1 > 0, \u03b2 < 0, and \u03b3 = 0. One find several works for both the models, but from the existing literature, it seems that the work on the time-fractional Black-Scholes model is comparatively less and confined. Therefore, in this paper, we have considered the time-fractional Black-Scholes model to solve it numerically using the collocation method based on the exponential B-spline functions."

We approximate the Caputo time fractional derivative C0D \u00b5 t u(\u03ba, t) at tn+1, n = \u22121, 0, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Nt \u2212 1, using L1 method [43] as follows\nC 0D \u00b5 t u(\u03ba, tn+1) =\n1\n\u0393(1\u2212 \u00b5)\n\u222b tn+1\n0\n(tn+1 \u2212 s)\u2212\u00b5 \u2202u\n\u2202s (\u03ba, s)ds\n= 1\n\u0393(1\u2212 \u00b5)\nn\u2211\nk=0\n\u222b tk+1\ntk\n(tn+1 \u2212 s)\u2212\u00b5 [ u(\u03ba, tk+1)\u2212 u(\u03ba, tk)\nht\n] ds+Rn+1\n= h \u2212\u00b5 t\n\u0393(2\u2212 \u00b5)\nn\u2211\nk=0\nwk [u(\u03ba, tn\u2212k+1)\u2212 u(\u03ba, tn\u2212k)] +Rn+11 , (11)\nwhere wk = (k + 1) 1\u2212\u00b5 \u2212 (k)1\u2212\u00b5 and the truncation error Rn+11 is bounded by\n|Rn+1| \u2264 k1h2\u2212\u00b5t , (12)\nwhere k1 is a constant.\nLemma 3.1. The coefficients wk satisfy [44] (a). w0 = 1, (b). wk > 0, 0 \u2264 k \u2264 n, (c). < wk > is monotonic decreasing sequence, (d). \u2211n k=0(wk \u2212 wk+1) + wn+1 = 1.\nAt time level n + 1, the equation (8) takes the form\nC 0D \u00b5 t u(\u03ba, tn+1) = \u03b1\n\u22022un+1(\u03ba)\n\u2202\u03ba2 + \u03b2\n\u2202un+1(\u03ba)\n\u2202x \u2212 \u03b3un+1(\u03ba) + \u03c8n+1(\u03ba).

Substitution of equation (11) in equation (13) gives\nn\u2211\nk=0\nwk [u(\u03ba, tn\u2212k+1)\u2212 u(\u03ba, tn\u2212k)] +Rn+1 = \u03b1\u03b3\u0303 \u22022un+1(\u03ba)\n\u2202\u03ba2 + \u03b2\u03b3\u0303\n\u2202un+1(\u03ba)\n\u2202\u03ba \u2212 \u03b3\u03b3\u0303un+1(\u03ba) + \u03b3\u0303\u03c8n+1(\u03ba),(14)\n(\u22121 \u2264 n \u2264 Nt \u2212 1), where\n\u03b3\u0303 = \u0393(2\u2212 \u00b5)h\u00b5t .\nThe initial and boundary conditions in (9) result in\n  \nu0(\u03ba) = z(\u03ba), un+1(Ip) = H (tn+1), \u22121 \u2264 n \u2264 Nt \u2212 1, un+1(Fp) = G (tn+1), \u22121 \u2264 n \u2264 Nt \u2212 1.\n(15)\nThe approximate solution U n+1(\u03ba) to the analytical solution un+1(\u03ba) of problem (8)-(9)\nis considered to be in the following form\nU n+1(\u03ba) =\nN\u03ba+1\u2211\nm=\u22121\nR n+1 m Qm(\u03ba), (16)\nwhere Rn+1m are unknown coefficients that need to be determined.

Finally, we get for each n a tri-diagonal system of (N\n\u03ba +1) equations in (N \u03ba +1) unknowns which can be solved by the Thomas algorithm.\nWe have\nSRn+1 = Q ( R n \u2212 n\u2211\nk=1\nwk(R n\u2212k+1 \u2212 Rn\u2212k) ) +B, (26)\nwhere\nS =   E1 E2 0 0 .. 0 0 0 0 \u03c71 \u03c72 \u03c73 0 .. 0 0 0 0 0 \u03c71 \u03c72 \u03c73 .. 0 0 0 0 ..\n0 0 0 0 .. \u03c71 \u03c72 \u03c73 0 0 0 0 0 .. 0 \u03c71 \u03c72 \u03c73 0 0 0 0 .. 0 0 \u2212E2 E3\n  ,\nR n =  \nRn0 Rn1\n. . .\nRnM\u22121\nRnM\n  , Q =   0 0 0 0 ..... 0 0 0 0 \u03b7 1 \u03b7 0 ..... 0 0 0 0 0 \u03b7 1 \u03b7 ..... 0 0 0 0 .....\n0 0 0 0 ..... \u03b7 1 \u03b7 0 0 0 0 0 ..... 0 \u03b7 1 \u03b7 0 0 0 0 ..... 0 0 0 0\n  ,\nE1 = \u03b1\u03b3\u0303\u03b7\u0304\n( 2 + 1\n\u03b7\n) \u2212 \u03b2\u03b3\u0303e\u0303(c\u0303\u2212 1)\n\u03b7 ,\nE2 = \u22122\u03b2\u03b3\u0303e\u0303(c\u0303\u2212 1),\nE3 = \u03b1\u03b3\u0303\u03b7\u0304\n( 2 + 1\n\u03b7\n) + \u03b2\u03b3\u0303e\u0303(c\u0303\u2212 1)\n\u03b7 ,\nand\nB =   Hn \u2212 \u2211n k=1wk(Hn\u2212k+1 \u2212 Hn\u2212k)\u2212 \u03c71\u03b7 Hn+1 + \u03b3\u0303\u03c8n+1(\u03ba0) \u03b3\u0303\u03c8n+1(\u03ba1) \u03b3\u0303\u03c8n+1(\u03ba2) . . .\n\u03b3\u0303\u03c8n+1(\u03baN\u03ba\u22121) Gn \u2212 \u2211n k=1wk(Gn\u2212k+1 \u2212 Gn\u2212k)\u2212 \u03c73\u03b7 Gn+1 + \u03b3\u0303\u03c8n+1(\u03baN\u03ba )\n  .\nWe observe that the set of systems in (26) for n = 0, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , Nt, can be solved recursively if we know the initial vector R0. Note that R0\u22121 and R 0 N\u03ba+1 can be then calculated using equations (24) and (25) respectively.\n3.3. Initial state\nTo start the process, an appropriate initial vector R0 is needed for the system. For this, we consider the initial conditions in (22),\nU 0 \u03ba (Ip) = z \u2032(Ip), U 0 \u03ba (Fp) = z \u2032(Fp).\nNow substituting the relation (18) in the above two equations we get\nU 0 \u03ba (\u03ba0) = U 0 \u03ba (Ip) = e\u0303(c\u0303\u2212 1)[R01 \u2212 R0\u22121] = z\u2032(Ip), (27)\nU 0 \u03ba (\u03baN\u03ba ) = U 0 \u03ba (Fp) = e\u0303(c\u0303\u2212 1)[R0N\u03ba+1 \u2212 R0N\u03ba\u22121] = z\u2032(Fp). (28)\nFurther, the relation (17) with the initial condition in (22), yields an algebraic system of (N\n\u03ba + 1) equations\nU 0(\u03bam) = \u03b7R 0 m\u22121 + R 0 m + \u03b7R 0 m+1 = zm, m = 0, 1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N\u03ba, (29)\nwith unknowns R0\u22121,R 0 0 ,R 0 1 , . . . ,R 0 N\u03ba\u22121,R 0 N\u03ba ,R0N\u03ba+1. Here, R 0 \u22121 and R 0 N\u03ba+1 can be removed using equations (27) and (28) respectively. Thus, we get a tridiagonal system of size (N \u03ba + 1)\u00d7 (N \u03ba + 1) which can also be solved using the Thomas algorithm.

Also, the initial condition of the problem implies that \u03bb\u03030 = 0. At the first time level, i.e. for n = 0, the equation (43) can be written as\n\u03c72\u03bb 1 m = \u2212\u03c71\u03bb1m\u22121 \u2212 \u03c73\u03bb1m+1 + \u03b7\u03bb0m\u22121 + \u03bb0m + \u03b7\u03bb0m+1 + \u03b3\u0303(\u03c8\u03031m \u2212 \u03c81m), (47)\n0 \u2264 m \u2264 N \u03ba .\nBy using Taylor\u2019s series expansion, for sufficiently small h \u03ba , we have\n\u03c72\u03bb 1 m = \u03bb 1 m(\u2212\u03c71 \u2212 \u03c73) + \u03b3\u0303(\u03c8\u03031m \u2212 \u03c81m). (48)\nAfter rearranging the terms and taking the absolute values on both sides of equation (48) we have\n|\u03bb1m| = \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u03b3\u0303(\u03c8\u03031m \u2212 \u03c81m)\n(\u03c71 + \u03c72 + \u03c73)\n\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u2264 \u03b3\u0303Mh2 \u03ba (2\u03b7 + 1)(1 + \u03b3\u03b3\u0303) \u2264 M\u0303h2 \u03ba , 0 \u2264 m \u2264 N \u03ba , (49)\nwhere M\u0303 = M\u03b3\u0303 (1+2\u03b7)(1+\u03b3\u03b3\u0303) . Also, from the boundary conditions we have the following esti-\nmates for \u03bb1\u22121 and \u03bb 1 N\u03ba+1 :\n|\u03bb1\u22121| \u2264 k\u0303h2\u03ba and |\u03bb1N\u03ba+1| \u2264 k\u0303h2\u03ba, (50)\nwhere k\u0303 is a constant independent of h \u03ba . Now combining the inequalities (49) and (50), we have\n\u03bb\u03031 \u2264M1h2\u03ba, (51)\nwhere M1 = max{M\u0303, k\u0303}. Next, we use the mathematical induction to prove that \u03bb\u0303n+1 \u2264 r\u2217h2x, where r\u2217 is a positive constant independent of hx. Therefore, for this purpose we assume that\n\u03bb\u0303j \u2264 Kjh2x (52)\nis true for 1 \u2264 j \u2264 n. Since in equation (51) we have shown that result (52) is true for j = 1. Now we will prove the result for j = n + 1. So, let K\u0303 = max\n0\u2264j\u2264n Kj and write the\nequation (43) in the form\n\u03c72\u03bb n+1 m = \u2212\u03c71\u03bbn+1m\u22121 \u2212 \u03c73\u03bbn+1m+1 + wn(\u03b7\u03bb0m\u22121 + \u03bb0m + \u03b7\u03bb0m+1) +\nn\u22121\u2211\nk=0\n(wk \u2212 wk+1)(\u03b7\u03bbn\u2212km\u22121 + \u03bbn\u2212km + \u03b7\u03bbn\u2212km+1)\n+\u03b3\u0303(\u03c8\u0303n+1m \u2212 \u03c8n+1m ),\n(0 \u2264 m \u2264 N \u03ba ). (53)\nBy applying Taylor\u2019s series expansion, for sufficiently small h \u03ba we can have\n\u03c72\u03bb n+1 m = (\u2212\u03c71 \u2212 \u03c73)\u03bbn+1m + wn(2\u03b7 + 1)\u03bb0m + (2\u03b7 + 1)\nn\u22121\u2211\nk=0\n(wk \u2212 wk+1)\u03bbn\u2212km + \u03b3\u0303(\u03c8\u0303n+1m \u2212 \u03c8n+1m ),\nAfter rearranging the terms and taking the absolute values on both sides of above equation and using the assumption (52) we have\n(\u03c71 + \u03c72 + \u03c73)|\u03bbn+1m | \u2264 wn(2\u03b7 + 1)|\u03bb0m|+ (2\u03b7 + 1) n\u22121\u2211\nk=0\n(wk \u2212 wk+1)|\u03bbn\u2212km |+ \u03b3\u0303|(\u03c8\u0303n+1m \u2212 \u03c8n+1m )|\n\u2264 K\u0303(2\u03b7 + 1) ( n\u22121\u2211\nk=0\n{(wk \u2212 wk+1) + wn} ) h2 \u03ba + \u03b3\u0303|(\u03c8\u0303n+1m \u2212 \u03c8n+1m )|.\nThus, |\u03bbn+1m | \u2264 w0K\u0303(2\u03b7 + 1)h\n2 \u03ba (\u03c71 + \u03c72 + \u03c73) + \u03b3\u0303|(\u03c8\u0303n+1m \u2212 \u03c8n+1m )| (\u03c71 + \u03c72 + \u03c73) .\nNow using the inequality (46) we have\n|\u03bbn+1m | \u2264 K\u0303h2 \u03ba\n(1 + \u03b3\u03b3\u0303) +\n\u03b3\u0303Mh2 \u03ba\n(2\u03b7 + 1)(1 + \u03b3\u03b3\u0303) \u2264M\u2217h2 \u03ba , 0 \u2264 m \u2264 N \u03ba , (54)\nwhere M\u2217 = K\u0303 (1+\u03b3\u03b3\u0303) + M\u03b3\u0303 (2\u03b7+1)(1+\u03b3\u03b3\u0303) .\nLike before as in (50), we can obtain bounds for |\u03bbn+1\u22121 | and |\u03bbn+1N\u03ba+1|. With the help of these two bounds along with (54), it can be inferred that there exists a constant r\u2217 independent of h \u03ba such that\n\u03bb\u0303n+1 \u2264 r\u2217h2x, (55)\nwhere r\u2217 = max{M\u2217, k\u0303}.

(57)\nThus, using Theorem 5.2 and inequality (56), we get\n||un+1(\u03ba)\u2212 U n+1(\u03ba)||\u221e \u2264 \u03bb\u2217h2\u03ba, \u2200n \u2265 0,\nwhere \u03bb\u2217 = 5 2 r\u2217 + c0h 2 \u03ba . Hence, the proof is complete.\nTheorem 5.4. The present numerical scheme (23) for the TFBSM (8)-(9) is convergent of order O(h2\u2212\u00b5t + h 2 \u03ba ).\nProof. Theorem 5.3 together with relation (12) provides us the following result\n||u(\u03ba, t)\u2212 U n+1(\u03ba)||\u221e \u2264 k2h2\u2212\u00b5t + k3h2\u03ba,\nwhere k2 and k3 are positive constants, and thus the proposed method is convergent of order O(h2\u2212\u00b5t + h 2 \u03ba ) ."

The results of\nthis table validate the theoretical order of convergence proved in Theorem 5.4. Similarly, L2 and L\u221e errors with corresponding orders of convergence are calculated for \u03c1 = 1.5, Nt = 500 and multiple values of \u00b5, and are shown in Tables 4 and 5, respectively. From these tables, it can be viewed that as we increase the discretization points N\n\u03ba , the er-\nrors decrease and the numerically calculated spatial order of convergence is 2, which is in support of the result proved in Theorem 5.4.\nFigures 1, 4, and 6 represent the exact and numerical solutions taking different fractional orders \u00b5 for Examples 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 respectively.

The graphs shown in Figures 2, 5, and 7 compare the numerical and exact solutions of Examples 6.1, 6.2, and 6.3 respectively, at different time levels.

We will solve this problem with pre-mentioned values of parameters rf = 0.5, \u03b1 = 1.\nThe numerical results obtained by applying the proposed method for Example 6.2 are given in Tables 6, 7, 8, and 9. Tables 6 and 7, give the errors L2 and L\u221e with the corresponding orders of convergence calculated for \u03c1 = 0.5, Nt = 2500, and different fractional orders \u00b5. From these tables, we can see that the numerically evaluated spatial order of convergence comes out to be two. Similarly, from Tables 9 and 10, we can see that the errors L2 and L\u221e decrease as we increase the discretization points N\u03ba. Also, these tables show that the temporal order of convergence is O(h2\u2212\u00b5t ), which is consistent with Theorem 5.4.\nExample 6.3. Let us consider the problem (1)-(3) on the domain (0, 1)\u00d7 (0, 1),\nC 0D \u00b5 t u(\u03ba, t) = \u03b1\n\u22022u(\u03ba, t)\n\u2202\u03ba2 + \u03b2\n\u2202u(\u03ba, t)\n\u2202\u03ba \u2212 \u03b3u(\u03ba, t) + \u03c8(\u03ba, t),\nwith    u(\u03ba, 0) = \u03ba4(\u03ba \u2212 1), u(0, t) = 0, u(1, t) = 0,\nand the source term\n\u03c8(\u03ba, t) = 6\n\u0393(4\u2212 \u00b5)t 3\u2212\u00b5(\u03ba5 \u2212 \u03ba4)\u2212 (t3 + 1)(4\u03b1\u03ba2(5\u03ba \u2212 3) + \u03b2\u03ba3(5\u03ba \u2212 4)\u2212 \u03b3\u03ba4(\u03ba \u2212 1)).\nThe exact solution of this test problem is u(\u03ba, t) = (t3 + 1)\u03ba4(\u03ba\u2212 1). We will solve this problem with pre-mentioned values of parameters rf = 0.02, \u03c3 = 0.8.\nTables 10 and 11 display L2 and L\u221e errors with the respective orders of convergence for Example 6.3 that have been evaluated for the time fractional-orders \u00b5 = 0.5 and \u00b5 = 0.9, respectively. One can see that the orders of convergence shown in Tables 10 and 11 are sufficiently close to 1.5 and 1.1 respectively. So from here, we conclude that the numerically evaluated temporal order of convergence is O(h2\u2212\u00b5t ) which is consistent with Theorem 5.4. In a similar manner, the errors L2 and L\u221e with the respective spatial orders of convergence are tabulated in Tables 12 and 13 respectively.\nExample 6.4. Let us consider the TFBSM [45]\n\u2202\u00b5V (\u03be, \u03c4) \u2202\u03c4\u00b5 + \u03c32\u03be2 2 \u22022V (\u03be, \u03c4) \u2202\u03be2 +(rf\u2212DY )\u03be \u2202V (\u03be, \u03c4) \u2202\u03be \u2212rfV (\u03be, \u03c4) = 0, (\u03be, \u03c4) \u2208 (\u03beIp, \u03beFp)\u00d7(0, T\u0303 ),\n(61)\n(a)N \u03ba = Nt = 40 (b) N\u03ba = Nt = 80\n  \nV (\u03be, T\u0303 ) = \u03c6(\u03be), V (\u03beIp, \u03c4) = H (\u03c4), V (\u03beFp, \u03c4) = G (\u03c4),\nThe above model describes different option values depending on the functions \u03c6(\u03be), H (\u03c4), and G (\u03c4).\n\u2022 If \u03c6(\u03be) = max{K\u0303 \u2212 \u03be, 0}, H (\u03c4) = K\u0303e\u2212rf (T\u0303\u2212\u03c4) and G (\u03c4) = DY = 0, then the model represents the European put option.\n\u2022 If \u03c6(\u03be) = max{\u03be \u2212 K\u0303, 0}, H (\u03c4) = DY = 0 and G (\u03c4) = \u03beIf \u2212 K\u0303e\u2212rf (T\u0303\u2212\u03c4), then the model represents the European call option.\n\u2022 And if \u03c6(\u03be) = max{\u03be \u2212 K\u0303, 0} and H (\u03c4) = G (\u03c4) = 0, then the model describes the European double barrier knock-out call option.\nFor solving European call and European put option models numerically we have taken the parameters \u03c3 = 0.55, rf = 0.05, \u03beIp = 0.1(Ip = \u22122.3), \u03beFp = 100(Fp = 4.6), T\u0303 = 1(year), and the strike price K\u0303 = 50. Also, we take the parameters \u03c3 = 0.55, rf = 0.03, \u03beIp = 3(Ip = 1.1), \u03beFp = 15(Fp = 2.7), T\u0303 = 1(year), the dividend yield DY = 0.01, and the strike price K\u0303 = 10, to study the European double barrier knock-out call option model numerically.\nFigures 9 and 10 show how the orders of fractional derivative affect the European call option and put option, respectively. From these two figures, we can observe that when the stock price \u03be is less or greater than the strike price K\u0303, the option price is slightly affected by the order of the time-fractional derivative. And when the stock price \u03be is close to the strike price K\u0303, the option price is significantly affected by the time-fractional derivative order. Further, Figure 11 show how the different parameters affect the European put\noption price governed by TFBSM. From Figure 11(a), it can be observed that the rate of interest and the options are inversely proportional, i.e the higher the rate of interest, the lower the option. Similarly, Figure 11(b) reflects, how the stock price volatility influences the option price and supports a well-known statement \u201cThe higher the risk, the higher the return\u201d. In Figure 12, the graph is plotted between the stock price \u03be and the double barrier option price V for various values of time-fractional order \u00b5. It is worth noting here that for \u00b5 = 1, the TFBSM converts to the classical Black-Scholes model. This Figure 12 depicts that the double barrier option price is highly influenced by the time-fractional order. More specifically, the option price is inversely proportional to the fractional-order when the stock price is greater than or near the strike price K\u0303. And the peak of the option price curve occurred corresponding to \u00b5 = 0.2. This tells us that TFBSM can explain the jump movement of the problem much more clearly than the classic Black-Scholes model."

            "text": "In this paper, an efficient collocation method based on exponential B-spline functions is introduced to solve the TFBSM governing European options. First, we have changed the modified R-L fractional derivative operator to the Caputo fractional derivative operator by applying the variable transformation, then used the exponential B-spline functions to discretize the space derivative and a finite difference method to discretize the Caputo fractional derivative. As a result of the use of the exponential B-spline collocation method, a tri-diagonal algebraic system has been obtained that can be solved by the Thomas algorithm. Furthermore, the proposed numerical scheme has been shown to be unconditionally stable via the von-Neumann method. The method is implemented on a number of\nnumerical examples. And the obtained results confirm that the method is capable of approximating the TFBSM. In addition, as an application, the numerical scheme proposed for the TFBSM has been used to price several different European options and it has been observed that the order of the time-fractional derivative has a great impact on the option prices. Since the proposed scheme works well for the TFBSM, so it is our intention to extend this idea to solve other fractional problems numerically.\nDeclarations\nConflict of interest: The authors declare that they have no known competing financial interests or personal relationships that could have appeared to influence the work reported in this paper."
