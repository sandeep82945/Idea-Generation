    "abstractText": "Breynia distachia is a plant of genus Breynia belonging to family Phyllanthaceae. This study was conducted to isolate and examine the anti-inflammatory attributes of the roots of Breynia distachia. Methanol extract from roots were prepared by simple maceration. For phytochemical studies, isolation, purification, structure elucidation, metal analysis, total phenolic content, and solubility test were done by chromatographic and spectroscopic techniques. Anti-inflammatory activity was evaluated by cotton pallet edema model and carrageenan paw edema model, and antioxidant potential was evaluated by DPPH, FRAP, and ABTS antioxidants assays. Metal analysis of BD.Me revealed the presence of Na > Mg > K > Mn > Fe = Zn in respective order. Four phytochemicals such as gallic acid, quercetin, sinapic acid, and p-coumaric acid are found in Breynia distachia. Quercetin is present in relatively larger quantity, and shows antioxidant activity by reducing the ferric iron to ferrous iron. Novel distachionate shows high antioxidant activity in ABTS assay by reducing reactive oxygen species. Quantitative or qualitative analysis performed by HPLC indicates the ascending peaks or presence of secondary products (metabolites) respectively. Histopathology analysis of liver, spleen, heart, and kidney was done, revealing mild inflammations in spleen and liver, and no cytotoxicity in heart and kidney. Oral administration of BD.Me and ditachionate significantly inhibits the carrageenan and cotton pellet-induced paw edema in 1st and 2nd h with (ns = p > 0.05) than control. After 3rd, 4th, 5th, and 6th h, BD.Me and ditachionate showed inhibition of paw edema in a highly significant (*** = p < 0.001) manner as compared to control. In cotton-pellet edema model, distachionate shows a %inhibition of 57.3% at a dose level of 5 mg/kg. Docking values obtained from distachionate-COX-2 complex suggest a potent inhibitor evaluated for this protein. The distachionate shows effective anti-inflammatory activity. Methanol extracts of roots Molecules 2022, 27, 2596. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules27082596 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules Molecules 2022, 27, 2596 2 of 16 showed significant lipoxygenase inhibitory activity by IC50 values of 155.7 \u00b1 0.55 and 132.9 \u00b1 0.33 \u03bcg/mL. Data from various in vitro and in vivo models suggest that novel distachionate isolated from Breynia distachia shows strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities; it should be further studied for the exploration of its medicinal potential.",

            "text": "Mechanical stimulation, microbial invasion, and irritants can all produce inflammation, which is a complex biological reaction to tissue injury. Cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) is an enzyme of prostaglandins, produced in response to inflammation. COX-2 production supports the process of inflammation and mediates pain. The nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) selectively inhibits the COX-2 enzyme, hence inhibiting inflammation [1]. The inflammatory cytokines of the spinal cord, dorsal root ganglion, and injured nerves are associated with pain behavior. Cytokines are the proteins that are secreted by cells and have specific effect on the interaction of cells. They include lymphokine, monokines, chemokines, and interleukin. The activated macrophages produced inflammatory cytokines. The pathological pains are induced by IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, and TNF-\u03b1 cytokines [2]. All medicinal plants contained secondary metabolites. These metabolites are helpful for the treatment of different diseases. They show antioxidant, angiogenic, antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, and cell signaling effects that are vital contributors in wound healing process. They are classified according to their composition, chemical structure, solubility in various solvents, and according to their synthetic pathway. They are broadly classified into phenolics, terpenes, alkaloids, steroids, and flavonoids. All secondary metabolites show large biological activity, 25% of molecules used in pharmaceutical industry are of plant origin [3]. Breynia distachia is a plant of genus Breynia belonging to family Phyllanthaceae and consist of about 35 species which are distributed from India to Australia. The different constituents isolated from the genus are friedelan-3b-ol, friedelin, aviculin (+)-isolariciresinol9-rhamno-pyranoside, isoarborinol, arborinone, 5-hydroxy-7,8,4-trimethoxy, 2,4-dihydroxy6-methoxy-3-methyl acetophenone, and flavone respectively [4]. Breynia distachia is a shrub having purple, green, and white color leaves and reported to have antioxidant activity. Breynin I (a new sulfur-containing spiroketal glycoside) and Breyniaionoside E (a new terpenic glycoside) were isolated from the aerial parts of Breynia [5]. Due to the existence of secondary metabolites (glycosides, terpenoids, alkaloids, lignans, steroids, nucleosides, tannins, and phenolic), the genus Breynia has medicinal potential. Based on these facts this study aims to evaluate the anti-inflammatory and antioxidant potential of novel distachionate isolated from Breynia distachia in wound healing by modulating COX-2 and inflammatory cytokine in rat\u2019s liver. A series of in vivo and in vitro assays are performed. Moreover, possible mechanism of action with COX-2 will also be explored by the help of docking data. Results suggest that Breynia distachia extract and isolated compound i.e., distachionate has a strong anti-inflammatory impact and can be used to treat inflammation as well as other diseases."

            "text": "By using in vitro and in vivo models, the current study shows anti-inflammatory and antioxidant effects of BD.Me (methanolic extract of B. distachia) for the first time. Before in vivo experiments, metals are necessary for the maintenance of physiological and biological processes in the human body, so the extract was tested for the presence of many metals. Increases in their intake (above at specific permissible limits (PL)) can cause toxicity [6]. Metal analysis revealed the presence of Na > Mg > K > Mn > Fe = Zn in respective order. In observational studies, excessive sodium intake has been linked to inflammation in people with high blood pressure and atherosclerosis, while decreased salt intake has been linked to lower mortality, heart disease, and stroke. A high-sodium diet has been linked to elevated inflammatory signs in one small human investigation [7]. Mg has a strong anti-inflammatory impact. Magnesium deficiency inhibits the release of inflammatory mediators [8]. As a result, sodium, magnesium, potassium, zinc, iron, and manganese found in BD.Me are thought to contribute to its anti-inflammatory properties. Secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, glycosides, phenols, saponins, and tannins were found in BD.Me after phytochemical examination, whereas primary metabolites carbohydrates, proteins, and flavonoids were found to be absent. The COX-2, TNF, and IL are all inhibited by alkaloids, resulting in anti-inflammatory effects. Phenols have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects [9]. They block NF-KB, which inhibits iNOS, COX-2, LOX, and the production of inflammatory mediators (PGs, IL, and TNF) [10]. Glycosides prevent the synthesis and release of TNF, and IL-1, so they have anti-inflammatory properties [11]. Saponins are also thought to have anti-inflammatory properties [9]. They inhibit the COX-2 enzyme, resulting in lower levels of PGE2, NO, and TNF-\u03b1, resulting in anti-inflammatory effects [12]. In wound healing the tannins are involved and have analgesic, astringent, antibacterial, antifungal, antioxidant, and anti-inflammatory properties [9]. Antioxidant potential of B. distachia are evident by our findings of HPLC analysis (reveals that five different compounds are present). In the present study, HPLC analysis of BD.Me revealed the presence of quercetin with maximum peak area. The wound healing is enhanced by quercetin because it regulates cytokines, growth factors, and cells involved in the inflammatory and proliferative phases of the healing process [13]. Other phenolic compounds include p-coumaric acid, gallic acid, sinapic acid which show antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities by inhibiting COX-2 enzyme and by reducing NO, PGE2, and IL-6 levels. The damage caused by ROS and free radiclas is prevented by antioxidants [14]. Three antioxidant assays were performed for the assessment of scavenging activity of BD.Me and distachionate against different free radicals. The DPPH and ABTS assays are used for the measurement of antioxidant activity against cation free radicals and stable organic nitrogen, respectively, whereas antioxidant capacity is measured in the FRAP assay by ferric ion reduction. In DPPH and ABTS assays, low IC50 shows higher antioxidant potential, whereas in the FRAP assay, high reducing power shows high antioxidant potential. In the present study, the BD.Me and distachionate showed high free radical scavenging activity in these in DPPH, ABTS and FRAP assays. BD.Me shows higher scavenging activity than distachionate. Furthermore, most essential antioxidant enzyme of mitochondria is SOD, and it protects against superoxide anion. Neutrophil-mediated inflammation is inhibited by the SOD enzyme [15]. This study reveals that BD.Me and distachionate treatment increased the levels SOD and CAT, suggesting that the reduction in inflammation by reducing reactive oxygen species (ROS). Catalase is another oxygen-scavenging antioxidant and defense enzyme [16]. In carrageenan-induced paw edema the release of inflammatory mediators is biphasic. In the first phase histamine, serotonin, and bradykinin were released, and in second phase prostaglandins (PGs), cytokines, TNF-, IL-1, and IL-6 were released [17]. In the present study, during the early hours of BD.Me and distachionate dosing show significant suppression in paw edema, but more effective in later hours. In the treatment with BD.Me and distachionate, carrageenan-induced paw edema was significantly reduced. After 2 h of injection, distachionate and BD.Me show inhibition (significant) of paw edema induced by carageenan. The IL-6 (inflammatory marker) works by acute phase proteins generation,\nMolecules 2022, 27, 2596 12 of 16\nhave impact on B and T cells, boosts the VEGF expression, an angiogenesis promoter [18]. The pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF) stimulates oxidative damage at the inflammatory site and leukocyte recruitment to the epithelium [19]. The level of TNF- and IL-6 in rat\u2019s serum (treated with BD.Me and distachionate) were significantly reduced. At the site of inflammation the number of inflammatory cells were significantly decreased, which has been postulated as a possible cause. WBC migration is involved in cotton pellet-induced granuloma, which is a proliferative stage of inflammation. It is a standard method for determining anti-inflammatory potential during chronic inflammation. Monocyte filtration, fibroblast proliferation, angiogenesis, and exudation are all involved [20]. The inflammatory mediators in cotton pellet-induced inflammation are inhibited by the treatment of BD.Me and distachionate, implying that it inhibits the release and action of inflammatory mediators. Overall, distachionate and BD.Me show anti-inflammatory and antioxidant activities by inhibiting COX-2 and cytokines."
