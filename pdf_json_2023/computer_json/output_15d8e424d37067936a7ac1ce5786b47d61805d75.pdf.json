Introduction\nChaos is a unique nonlinear dynamical phenomenon with the properties of ergodicity, initial sensitivity, and the long-term unpredictability of motion trajectories [1\u20134]. In recent years, the study of chaos has become very popular, and it is widely used in the field of secure communication [5\u20137]. Chaos control and synchronization theory, which has great potential for application in the field of chaos research, has also become a hot spot in the high-tech competition between countries [8,9]. From the point of view of chaotic system interactions, studies related to chaotic synchronization can be divided into the following categories: generalized synchronization, phase synchronization, hysteresis synchronization, and so on [10\u201313]. In addition, during the process of research, researchers have proposed complete synchronization, projective synchronization, and adaptive synchronization [14\u201317]. In practical studies, the problem of parameter selection is inevitable regarding the structural differences between the drive and response systems. The generalized synchronization problem for chaotic or hyperchaotic systems would be a more relevant and worthwhile approach, given that the problems mentioned above can be easily solved for generalized chaotic synchronization systems. Meanwhile, the development of generalized synchronization theory has provided new tools for constructing more secure communication systems. Generalized synchronization is the gradual convergence of the trajectory curves of two chaotic systems to a time-independent transformation relationship over time; that is, a functional relationship is determined between the state of the driven system and the state of the responding system, and the synchronization of the driven and responding systems is achieved by this functional relationship, which can be deterministic or nondeterministic [18\u201322]. This paper proposes a generalized chaotic synchronization\nEntropy 2023, 25, 818. https://doi.org/10.3390/e25050818 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/entropy\nEntropy 2023, 25, 818 2 of 18\nmethod incorporating error-feedback coefficients into the process of determining the function relationships, which is based on the principle of using the relationships between the functions in the designed controller to synchronize the drive and response systems. Most of the systems used in practical engineering are high-dimensional nonlinear systems. With the continuous research in applied mathematical theory and the rapid development of computer technology, lower-dimensional chaotic systems in practical applications are facing more challenges; hence, high-dimensional hyperchaos with more than two Lyapunov exponents is of significant interest. Based on the above, new 3D and 6D discrete chaotic systems are constructed and proposed in this paper. The constructed new high-dimensional chaotic systems are used as the driving systems, and the response system is constructed by the proposed generalized chaotic synchronization method that incorporates error-feedback coefficients. The effectiveness of the synchronization method was confirmed by experiment. The paper is organized as follows: The generalized synchronization theoretic of discrete chaotic systems and the stability principle of error systems are analyzed in Section 2. A new 3D discrete chaotic system is proposed in Section 3, in which the dynamic behavior of phase diagrams, Lyapunov exponent diagrams, and bifurcation diagrams are depicted and analyzed. Subsequently, a generalized chaotic synchronization method incorporating error-feedback coefficients is proposed, with a new 3D discrete chaotic system as the driving system. The effectiveness of the method was verified by experimental simulations. In Section 4, a new 6D discrete chaotic system is proposed, and the dynamic behavioral properties of its phase diagram, Lyapunov exponent diagram, and bifurcation diagram are analyzed. Then, the new 6D discrete chaotic system is applied as the driving system through the proposed generalized chaotic synchronization method incorporating error-feedback coefficients; the effectiveness of the method was further demonstrated by performing simulations. In Section 5, a digital image transmission system based on 6D chaotic synchronization and encryption is proposed, the encryption and decryption processes are analyzed in detail, and encryption and decryption simulations are given. Then, in Section 6, security analyses are carried out based on the previously proposed encrypted image transmission system. Finally, the conclusion is given in the last section.\n2. Theory of Generalized Synchronization for Discrete Chaotic Systems\nIn our study of chaotic control problems, it is more important to convert the problem of chaotic synchronization into the analysis of system errors. The main idea is to consider the difference in the state between the drive and response systems, that is, the synchronization error of the system. Once a reasonable controller has been designed by parameter changes to make the system error asymptotically stable at the origin point, then the two systems can be considered synchronized with each other. Firstly, the mathematical model of generalized chaotic synchronization is proposed in this paper and described, as follows.\nDefinition 1. Consider two n-dimensional nonlinear dynamical systems, and describe them using the following equations:\nX(k + 1) = F(X(k)) (1)\nY(k + 1) = Q(Y(k)) + G(X(k), Y(k)) (2)\nwhere X, Y \u2208 R, and F(\u00b7) as well as Q(\u00b7) are n-dimensional nonlinear functions, and G(\u00b7) is an n-dimensional input control function. If the selectable function G(X(k), Y(k)) is applied such that k\u2192 \u221e , and thus lim\nk\u2192\u221e \u2016G(X(k), Y(k))\u2016 = 0, then it can be translated into the study of the error\nsystem (e(k)), for which e(k) = G(X(k), Y(k)), and therefore lim k\u2192\u221e \u2016e(k)\u2016 = 0. In this case, the drive system and response system can reach a generalized synchronization.\nTheorem 1. Define an invertible transform ( H : Rm \u2192 Rm );consequently, there is an incorporated error-feedback coefficient (\u03b7).Where the feedback coefficient satisfies the condition \u03b7 \u2208 (\u22121, 1), it\nEntropy 2023, 25, 818 3 of 18\ncan enable the progressive stability of the zero solution of Error Equation (3) of the system, which is represented as follows:\ne(k + 1) = H(Xm(k + 1))\u2212Y(k + 1) (3)\nBecause the zero solution of Equation (3) is gradually stable, by introducing a reasonable feedback coefficient (\u03b7), the drive and response systems can be synchronized in a universal way. Hence, according to Theorem 1, it can be concluded that to synchronize the drive system (1) and response system (2), a nonlinear error system (e(k)) needs to be constructed, and the progressive stability of the error equation of the system (e(k + 1) = H(Xm(k + 1))\u2212Y(k + 1)) needs to be guaranteed. Based on the above, the next major concern is to determine that the system error equation is asymptotically stable at the original point; therefore, the following lemmas are given:\nLemma 1 ([23]). Given a linear discrete system, which can be defined as follows:\nx(k + 1) = Ax(k) (4)\nwhere A is a n\u00d7 n coefficient matrix, and A \u2208 Rn\u00d7n, we can draw the following conclusions: (1) Chaotic system (4) is progressively stable if the modulus of all eigenvalues of matrix A is not more than 1; (2) In case there is a matrix (Q > 0), so that the Lyapunov equation (ATPA \u2212 P = \u2212Q) has a\nunique positive solution (P), system (4) is asymptotically stable.\nProof of Lemma 1(1). Set V(x(k)) = xT(k)x(k), and then the tiny variables of V(x(k)) can be calculated as follows:\n\u2206V(x(k)) = V(x(k + 1))\u2212V(x(k)) = xT(k + 1)x(k + 1)\u2212 xT(k)x(k) = xT(k)AT Ax(k)\u2212 xT(k)x(k) \u2264 ( \u03bbmax ( AT A ) \u2212 1 ) xT(k)x(k)\n(5)\nBecause all the eigenvalues of matrix A have a value of modulo less than 1, all the eigenvalues of matrix AT A are integers, which are less than 1; therefore, \u2206V(x(k)) < 0, and system (4) is asymptotically stable.\nProof of Lemma 1(2). Set V(x(k)) = xT(k)Px(k), where P is a positive definite matrix, given that AT PA \u2212 P = \u2212Q, and then the tiny variables of V(x(k)) can be calculated as follows:\n\u2206V(x(k)) = V(x(k + 1))\u2212V(x(k)) = xT(k + 1)Px(k + 1)\u2212 xT(k)Px(k) = xT(k)AT PAx(k)\u2212 xT(k)Px(k) = xT(k) ( AT PA\u2212 P ) x(k)\n= \u2212xT(k)Qx(k) < 0\n(6)\nFurthermore, lim x\u2192\u221e x(k) = 0; hence, system (4) is asymptotically stable.\nBased on the proof processes for the stability of linear discrete systems as related in Lemma 1, the determination processes for the stability of nonlinear discrete systems can be given through Lemma 2, which is described as follows:\nLemma 2. For a nonlinear discrete system (x(k + 1) = f (x(k)), k = 0, 1, 2 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ), let xe = 0 (i.e., f (0) = 0) be the equilibrium point of the proposed system. Provided that the scalar function x(k) = 0 concerning V(x(k)) satisfies the following:\n(1) V(x(k)) > 0,\nEntropy 2023, 25, 818 4 of 18\n(2) \u2206V(x(k)) = V(x(k + 1))\u2212V(x(k)) < 0. then xe = 0 is progressively stable.\nProof of Lemma 2. For condition (1), let V(x(k)) = xT(k)x(k), and in the case of x 6= 0, V(x(k)) > 0, the first condition is proven. For condition (2), let V(x(k)) = xT(k)Px(k). We can prove that P is a positive definite matrix from Lemma 1. Moreover, AT PA\u2212 P = \u2212Q, and Q > 0; subsequently, the small changes (V(x(k))) can be described (\u2206V(x(k))), which are calculated as follows:\n\u2206V(x(k)) = V(x(k + 1))\u2212V(x(k)) = xT(k + 1)Px(k + 1)\u2212 xT(k)Px(k) = xT(k)AT PAx(k)\u2212 xT(k)Px(k) = xT(k) ( AT PA\u2212 P ) x(k)\n= \u2212xT(k)Qx(k) < 0\n(7)\nThus, the proof of condition (2) is complete. Based on the above, it is concluded that nonlinear system (4) is asymptotically stable at the origin point. Thus, having proved Lemma 1 and Lemma 2, the proof of Theorem 1 can be obtained, which is as follows:\nProof of Theorem 1. According to Equations (1) and (2), Equation (3) can be calculated as follows:\ne(k + 1) = H(Xm(k + 1))\u2212Y(k + 1) = H(F(X(k)))\u2212Q(Y(k))\u2212 G(X(k), Y(k)) (8)\nwhere Q(Y(k)) = F(Y(k)) + U(k), and U(k) is a control function, which be represented as follows:\nU(k) = H(F(X(k)))\u2212 F(Y(k)) + (1\u2212 \u03b7)G(X(k), Y(k)) (9)\nThen, Equation (9) can be simplified as the following equation:\ne(k + 1) = \u03b7G(X(k), Y(k)) = \u03b7e(k) (10)\nDenote the scaled function of the nonlinear error system (e(k) = 0) represented as V(e(k)) = e(k)Te(k), and then the \u2206V(e(k)) is calculated as follows:\n\u2206V(e(k)) = V(e(k + 1))\u2212V(e(k)) = e(k + 1)Te(k + 1)\u2212 e(k)Te(k) = \u03b7e(k)T\u03b7e(k)\u2212 e(k)Te(k) = \u03b72e(k)Te(k)\u2212 e(k)Te(k) = ( \u03b72 \u2212 1 ) e(k)Te(k)\n(11)\nTherefore, when the parameter \u03b7 satisfies the condition \u03b72 < 1, \u2206V(e(k)) < 0; hence, V(e(k + 1))/V(e(k)) < 1 and lim\nk\u2192\u221e V(e(k)) = lim k\u2192\u221e eT(k)e(k) = 0.\nFurthermore, lim k\u2192\u221e e(k) = 0. Thus, according to Lemma 2, the nonlinear error system\n(e(k)) is asymptotically stable when e = 0, and, in turn, the drive and response systems are asymptotically synchronized.\nEntropy 2023, 25, 818 5 of 18\n3.

Implementation of a Universal Synchronization Method with Parameter Control and Analysis of The Dynamic Behavior of the Proposed 6D Discrete Chaotic System 4.1. The Proposed 6D Discrete Chaotic System\nHigh-dimensional chaotic systems have more complex dynamics than low-dimensional chaotic systems; thus, they are better able to resist the degradation of dynamics caused by the limited accuracy of computers. In this paper, a new 6D discrete chaotic system (21) is constructed by expanding on system (12), which can be presented as follows: x1(k + 1) = 0.665x1(k) 2 + ax1(k)\u2212 0.5; x2(k + 1) = 0.82x2(k) 2 \u2212 b; x3(k + 1) = cx3(k)(1\u2212 x3(k))2; x4(k + 1) = \u22123x24(k) + dx4(k) + 0.18; x5(k + 1) = 4x5(k)(1\u2212 x5(k)); x6(k + 1) = 4x6(k)(1\u2212 0.5x6(k)); (21)\nwhere a = 3.5, b = \u22122.34, c = 6.53, and d = 3.46, after 1000 iterations, and the Lyapunov exponents of the proposed system are 1.0227, 0.3837, \u22120.2378, \u22120.2999, 0.4955, and 1.7245, respectively; thus, system (21) is a hyperchaotic system because the four Lyapunov exponents are positive. Based on 64-bit Matlab software and double-floating-point representation, for different initial values of the state variables, the output of chaotic sequences and their autocorrelations are shown in Figure 5, in which Figure 5a,b,d,e prove that the chaotic sequences x4(k) and x6(k) have no periodicity, and Figure 5a,d demonstrate the proposed chaotic sequences with an initial value sensitivity.

Furthermore, the three color components of the original image are encrypted with chaotic sequences, and the calculation formula is Equation (31): \nER(j) = R(j)\u2295 P1(j) EG(j) = G(j)\u2295 P2(j) EB(j) = B(j)\u2295 P3(j)\n(31)\nStep 2: The encrypted sequences of the three color components are combined into E(k) using Equation (32):\nER(j) EG(j) EB(j) \u21d2 E(k) , k \u2208 (0, 3\u00d7 j) (32) Step 3: Chaotic hiding of E(k) with the chaotic sequence P4(j). The resulting mixed signal (S(k)) is transmitted in the common channel and is calculated as the following equation:\nS(k) = E(k) + P(k) (33)\nOn the receiving side of the proposed system, the response system will be i general synchronization with the driver system. Furthermore, the receiver will be able to decode all the state variables of the sender. Similarly, there are several parts to the decryption processes for the receiver of the proposed system.\nEntropy 2023, 25, 818 13 of 18\nStep 1: Reconstructing the chaotic signal (y(k)), the sequences generated after quantization are denoted as P1(j) \u2032, P2(j) \u2032 , P3(j)\n\u2032, and P4(3\u00d7 j)\u2032, as we can see from Figure 8. The decryption process is the inverse of the encryption process; thus, it is important to perform the anti-hiding operation on the signal S(k) to obtain E\u2032(k), which is calculated as follows:\nS(k)\u2212 P(k)4 = E \u2032(k) (34)\nStep 2: Decompose E\u2032(k) into three color components. The formulation is calculated as Equation (35), and therefore the encrypted image is decoded using Equation (36):\nE\u2032(k)\u21d2  E\u2032R(j) E\u2032G(j) E\u2032B(j)\n(35)\n E\u2032R(j)\u2295 P\u20321(j) = R\u2032(j) E\u2032G(j)\u2295 P\u20322(j) = G\u2032(j) E\u2032B(j)\u2295 P\u20323(j) = B\u2032(j)\n(36)\nThe standard Lena (256 \u00d7 256) image was used as an example for the encryption and decryption processes, and the results of the operation are shown in Figure 9.\nEntropy 2023, 25, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 19 ( ) ( ) ( )S k E k P k= + (33)\nOn the receiving side of the proposed system, the response system will be in general synchronization with the driver system.

Keyspace Analysis Cryptographic system security and resistance to exhaustive attacks are affected by the size of the key space. The sequences of the 6D discrete hyperchaotic system ((21)) are applied at the encryption stage, as the production of keys depends mainly on the parameters and initial conditions of the system. Hence, all the iterative variables of the proposed chaotic system ( 1 2 3 4 5 6, , , , , , , , ,x x x x x x a b c d ) can be used as keys. Calculation is performed by means of the double-floating-point number with 64-bit precision; therefore, the key space is 53 10 530 1002 2 2\u00d7 = > , which is much large than 2100. Consequently, the security of the image encryption system is improved and the resistance to exhaustive attacks is increased [24,25].\n6.3. Key Sensitivity Analysis Key sensitivity is an important measure to evaluate the security of an encrypted image. Security is highly reliable if any minimal change to the key results in a large modification; thus, the more sensitive the key, the more secure the encryption system.

The results of the experiment are illustrated in Figure 11, in which it can be seen that the image could not be decrypted, even with minor changes to the key.\n6.4.

The same encrypted Lena as in Section 5.1 was cropped with black pixels, which is shown in Figure 12a.

Correlation Analyses The analysis of image pixel correlation is one of the important indicators of the encryption effect of encrypted images. The color images were analyzed for correlations from R, G, and B, which are represented as red, green, and blue colors, respectively.

Additionally, the dynamics of the new systems are analyzed, and the phase diagram, Lyapunov exponent diagram, and bifurcation diagram of the systems are presented and analyzed simultaneously. The proposed 3D and 6D discrete chaotic systems were constructed as drive systems, and the response systems were constructed by employing the new generalized synchronization method incorporating error-feedback coefficients. The experimental results show that the design of adaptive generalized synchronous systems can be realized provided that the feedback coefficient (\u03b7) of the error system satisfies certain conditions for the design of adaptive generalized synchronous systems. Further, the generalized synchronization method incorporating the error-feedback coefficient, and the incorporation of it into the controller, enables simpler and more flexible control of the generalized synchronization. Finally, a chaotic synchronization and encryption\u2013decryption system for secure digital image transmission was constructed by applying the method of generalized synchronous chaotic systems incorporating the error-feedback coefficients devised in this paper. Due to the limited accuracy of the computer, the system proposed in this paper is more resistant to dynamic degradation and, hence, these features of high-\nEntropy 2023, 25, 818 17 of 18\ndimensional chaotic systems play an active role and have very good theoretical value in image encryption as well as chaotic synchronization.\nAuthor Contributions: Y.X.: methodology, software, and writing\u2014original draft preparation.
