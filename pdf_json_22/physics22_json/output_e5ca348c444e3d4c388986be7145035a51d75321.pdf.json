While the methods used in the literature do not easily generalize to quantum field theory, in this paper the path-integral representation of a PT -symmetric \u2212g\u03c6 theory is shown to provide a unified formulation for general D.

DOI: 10.1103/PhysRevD.106.125016\nI. INTRODUCTION\nIn search of physics beyond the StandardModel of particle physics, non-Hermitian PT -symmetric Hamiltonians have been used recently in model building [1]. The importance of PT symmetry for non-Hermitian quantum-mechanical theories with real energy eigenvalues was discovered in 1998 [2] on the basis of numerical and semiclassical arguments. The quantum-mechanical theories considered are governed by a Schr\u00f6dinger equation with potential V\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc m2x2=2\u00fe gx2\u00f0ix\u00de\u03f5=4, where \u03f5 is a real parameter. This potential is invariant under PT reflection P\u2236 x \u2192 \u2212x, T \u2236 x \u2192 x, i \u2192 \u2212i. For \u03f5 \u2265 0 the energy spectrum of the Hamiltonian was found to be real numerically [2]. For the massless case spectral reality was proved for \u03f5 > 0 byDorey et al. using the methods of integrable systems [3,4]. For \u03f5 \u00bc 2 the massless case can be mapped to a Hermitian Hamiltonian with the same spectrum [5,6]. The study of PT -symmetric systems is an active research area [4,7].\nQuantum mechanics is quantum field theory in onedimensional spacetime. However, very little is known about the nature of PT -symmetric quantum field theory with spacetime dimension D > 1, and the calculational tools required for analyzing such theories remain largely undeveloped. Methods that have been successful in D \u00bc 1 [4] do not extend to higher dimensions. Recent papers [8\u201310] have considered the case D > 1, but the proposed methods have yet to be implemented in D \u00bc 4. In this paper we study the non-Hermitian PT -symmetric scalar theory with potential V\u00f0\u03c6\u00de \u00bc m2\u03c62=2 \u2212 g\u03c64=4 (m, g > 0) using the path-integral formulation of quantum theories. Unlike earlier methods, here we study this theory by constructing a relation between its Euclidean partition function and that of a Hermitian theory with a positive quartic potential V\u00f0\u03d5\u00de \u00bc m2\u03c62=2\u00fe \u03bb\u03c64=4 (m, \u03bb > 0). Specifically, we conjecture and propose the following general relation for D \u2265 1:\nlogZPT \u00f0g\u00de \u00bc 1 2 logZHerm\u00f0\u03bb \u00bc \u2212g\u00fe i0\u00fe\u00de\n\u00fe 1 2 logZHerm\u00f0\u03bb \u00bc \u2212g \u2212 i0\u00fe\u00de; \u00f01\u00de\nwhere ZHerm\u00f0\u03bb\u00de is the usual Euclidean partition function for the Hermitian theory, which must be analytically continued to \u03bb \u00bc \u2212g i0\u00fe (g > 0) in this equation. The functional integral ZPT \u00f0g\u00de must be defined with an appropriate contour CPT to ensure both existence and PT symmetry,\n*wenyuan.ai@kcl.ac.uk \u2020cmb@wustl.edu \u2021sarben.sarkar@kcl.ac.uk\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

The Euclidean partition function can always be put in a form of an exponential function via the exponentiation of disconnected Feynman diagrams in perturbation theory or of the multi-instanton contributions when there are nonpeturbative stationary points; logZ is related to the energy. Therefore, (1) implies that\nEPT \u00f0g\u00de \u00bc 1 2 EHerm\u00f0\u2212g\u00fe i0\u00fe\u00de \u00fe 1 2 EHerm\u00f0\u2212g \u2212 i0\u00fe\u00de: \u00f02\u00de\nFor positive real \u03bb, EHerm\u00f0\u03bb\u00de \u00bc E Herm\u00f0\u03bb \u00de. This relation is analytic, so it holds when EHerm\u00f0\u03bb\u00de is analytically continued to \u03bb \u00bc \u2212g\u00fe i0\u00fe. We thus have Re\u00bdEHerm\u00f0\u2212g\u00fe i0\u00fe\u00de \u00bc Re\u00bdEHerm\u00f0\u2212g \u2212 i0\u00fe\u00de and Im\u00bdEHerm\u00f0\u2212g\u00fe i0\u00fe\u00de \u00bc \u2212Im\u00bdEHerm\u00f0\u2212g \u2212 i0\u00fe\u00de . Therefore, (1) implies a real energy spectrum for the non-Hermitian \u2212g\u03c64 theory. We first study an analogous relation for toy D \u00bc 0 partition functions, which are ordinary integrals. The relation in this case takes a form similar to (1) but without logarithms, and it can be rigorously proved because the toy partition functions can be calculated exactly. We then discuss some simple generalizations in D \u00bc 0 in order to understand why the logarithms in (1) appear when one considers partition functions with D \u2265 1, which are functional integrals. For D \u00bc 1, we partly check the relation by calculating the imaginary contributions to the ground-state energy. Although on both sides of (2) the imaginary parts cancel trivially, before their cancellation one can find agreement between separate pieces on the lhs and rhs. Since in the path-integral formulation, there is no essential difference between the cases D > 1 and D \u00bc 1 except for the well-understood regularization and renormalization, we conjecture that the relation (1) holds also for D > 1."

The contour CPT is not unique; deforming a contour joining the PT -symmetric Stokes wedges leaves the value of the integral unchanged.\nAn example of CPT is shown as the solid line in Fig. 1.

REV. D 106, 125016 (2022)\n125016-2\nOne may understand the relation (5) in another way. When the function Z\u0303Herm\u00f0\u03bb\u00de is analytically continued away from the positive real axis via \u03bb \u00bc g exp\u00f0i\u03b8\u00de, where g > 0, it could still have an integral representation as in (3) but with the contour rotated via x \u2192 x exp\u00f0\u2212i\u03b8=4\u00de. Then, Z\u0303Herm\u00f0gei\u00f0\u03c0\u22120\u00fe\u00de\u00de could be represented by the same integral but with the contour given by C1 in Fig. 1, while Z\u0303Herm\u00f0ge\u2212i\u00f0\u03c0\u22120\u00fe\u00de\u00de corresponds to the contour C2. In these cases, the integrand is the same as that in (4) with \u03f5 \u00bc 2. Because of the symmetry x \u2192 \u2212x in the integrand, the contour CPT can be effectively viewed as half C1 plus half C2 and thus one arrives at the relation (5).\nB. Imaginary parts and semiclassical estimates\nIn the above example the partition functions can be calculated exactly. This is not possible when D \u2265 1. Therefore, we search for an alternative approach where precise results of the partition functions are not needed, but one still can examine the relation between the Hermitian and the non-Hermitian PT -symmetric Euclidean partition functions. From (7), one sees that Z\u0303Herm\u00f0\u2212g i0\u00fe\u00de contains an imaginary part:\nIm\u00bdZ\u0303Herm\u00f0\u2212g i0\u00fe\u00de\n\u00bc m\u03c0 2 ffiffiffiffiffi 2g p exp \u2212 m4 8g I1 4 m4 8g \u2212 I\u22121 4 m4 8g\n\u00bc \u2213 ffiffiffi \u03c0\np m e\u2212m 4=4g for g \u2192 0: \u00f08\u00de\nAlthough these imaginary parts cancel trivially on the rhs of (5), one can still observe the same imaginary parts on the lhs in evaluating Z\u0303PT \u00f0g\u00de semiclassically. For small g we approximate the integral (4) using the method of steepest descents [12]. There are three stationary points: xL \u00bc\u2212m= ffiffigp , x0 \u00bc 0, and xR \u00bc m= ffiffigp . Steepest paths satisfy the constant-phase condition Im\u00bdm2x2=2 \u2212 gx4=4 \u00bc const, where the constant is determined by the phase at the stationary point. Writing x\u00bc xRe\u00fe ixIm, we have m2\u00f0xRexIm\u00de\u00bc g\u00f0xRexIm\u00de\u00f0x2Re\u2212x2Im\u00de, which gives xRe \u00bc 0; xIm \u00bc 0, x2Re \u2212 x2Im \u00bc m2=g. At the stationary point x0, the solution with xIm \u00bc 0 corresponds to the steepest-descent path, while at xL or xR, x2Re \u2212 x2Im \u00bc m2=g gives the steepest-descent path. Next, we deform the contour CPT to the new one C0PT shown in Fig. 2. In the case of a path integral for D \u2265 1, all the steepest-descent paths crossing a stationary point constitute a hypersurface called a Lefschetz thimble [13\u201316]. For D \u00bc 0, Lefschetz thimbles reduce to the steepest-descent one-dimensional paths through the stationary points, e.g., the hyperbolas in Fig. 2. Anticipating the generalization of our analysis to the caseD \u00bc 1, we call these paths in the present case thimbles, which are denoted by J L, J 0, and J R. We denote the half Lefschetz thimble\nof J L that goes to the lower (upper) half plane as J L;\u2212\u00f0\u00fe\u00de. Similarly, we denote the half Lefschetz thimble of J R going to the lower (upper) half plane as J R;\u2212\u00f0\u00fe\u00de. Thus, the deformed contour can be expressed as C0PT \u00bc J L;\u2212\u00fe J 0 \u00fe J R;\u2212, which is left-right symmetric. The leading contribution to Im\u00bdZ\u0303PT \u00f0g\u00de is easily obtained by evaluating the integral on J L;\u2212 and J R;\u2212 up to the Gaussian fluctuations:\nIm\u00bdZ\u0303PT \u00f0g\u00dejJ L=R;\u2212 \u00bc ffiffiffi \u03c0 p 2m exp\u00f0\u2212m4=\u00f04g\u00de\u00de:\nThese imaginary parts differ by a sign and so they also cancel on the lhs of (5). Comparing the above equation with the last line in (8), we see that for small g the imaginary parts from J L;\u2212 and J R;\u2212 are equal to those from 1 2 Z\u0303Herm\u00f0\u2212g \u2212 i0\u00fe\u00de and 12 Z\u0303Herm\u00f0\u2212g\u00fe i0\u00fe\u00de. The imaginary part from J L;\u2212 is supposed to be that from the left part of the standard contour CPT which is also the left part of C2 (see Fig. 1). The integral on the latter gives half of ZHerm\u00f0\u2212g \u2212 i0\u00fe\u00de. This explains the correspondence J L;\u2212 \u2194 \u2212g \u2212 i0\u00fe; J R;\u2212 \u2194 \u2212g\u00fe i0\u00fe in comparing the imaginary parts from the lhs and rhs of (5)."

The transition amplitude between position eigenstates is used in practical calculations and one can project it onto the vacuum persistence amplitude by taking T \u2192 \u221e. For the partition function Z \u00bc hx0j exp\u00f0\u2212H\u0302T\u00dejx0i the imaginary part of the ground-state energy can be calculated from this Euclidean partition function [17\u201320].

For the non-HermitianPT -symmetric theory with V\u00f0x\u00de \u00bc 1\n2 m2x2 \u2212 1 4 gx4 (g > 0), one must assign a\ncontour CPT properly to define ZPT \u00f0g\u00de. A possible way to define CPT is to let x \u00bc \u03b8\u00f0\u2212s\u00de exp\u00f0i\u03c0=4\u00des\u00fe \u03b8\u00f0s\u00de exp\u00f0\u2212i\u03c0=4\u00des, where s is real and \u03b8\u00f0s\u00de is the step function. Then CPT is composed of all the real functions s\u00f0\u03c4\u00de with s\u00f0\u2212T=2\u00de \u00bc s\u00f0T=2\u00de \u00bc 0. Unlike the D \u00bc 0 case, the PT -symmetric partition\nfunction defined above is difficult to compute. However, from the insights obtained in theD \u00bc 0 case, we conjecture the relation (1) between ZPT \u00f0g\u00de and ZHerm\u00f0\u03bb\u00de so that the former can be calculated from the latter. Below, we adopt the semiclassical evaluation of ZPT \u00f0g\u00de to motivate and partly check this relation.\nA. Semiclassical evaluation of ZPT \u00f0g\u00de As in the case of D \u00bc 0, to evaluate ZPT \u00f0g\u00de semiclassi-\ncally we deform the contour CPT and apply the method of steepest descents. We call the real function space fx\u00f0\u03c4\u00de\u2236x\u00f0\u2212T=2\u00de \u00bc x\u00f0T=2\u00de \u00bc 0g the real hyperplane, denoted as R\u221e. This is an infinite-dimensional space. To apply the method of the steepest descents we need to complexify this space to fz\u00f0\u03c4\u00de\u2236z\u00f0\u2212T=2\u00de \u00bc z\u00f0T=2\u00de \u00bc 0g, where z\u00f0\u03c4\u00de are complex functions. We denote the latter as C\u221e. We then find the deformed contour C0PT that passes through all relevant stationary points. The deformed contour C0PT is a middle-dimensional hypersurface [21] in the complexified space C\u221e. First, we identify the stationary points and we assume that all relevant stationary points are real as in the simple D \u00bc 0 case. In the present case, we have infinitely many real stationary points, but among all stationary points only three are fundamental (in the so-called dilute-instantongas approximation) and are in one-to-one correspondence with theD \u00bc 0 stationary points. All others are composed of these fundamental stationary points. First, we have the trivial stationary point x0\u00f0\u03c4\u00de \u00bc 0. We also have two fundamental instantons (also called bounces in the context of falsevacuum decay [17,18]), xL\u00f0\u03c4\u00de and xR\u00f0\u03c4\u00de, whose explicit forms are determined by solving the equation of motion\n\u2212 d2x d\u03c42 \u00fem2x \u2212 gx3 \u00bc 0\nwith boundary conditions x\u00f0\u03c4\u00dej\u03c4\u2192 \u221e \u00bc 0 and dx=d\u03c4j\u03c4\u00bc\u03c40 \u00bc 0.

The free parameter \u03c40 is a collective coordinate of the bounce characterizing its \u201cposition.\u201d In a rigorous sense,\nAI, BENDER, and SARKAR PHYS. REV. D 106, 125016 (2022)\n125016-4\nthe parameter \u03c40 means that there are infinitely many fundamental bounces for each type \u201cL=R\u201d that are degenerate in the Euclidean action. For any solution with chosen \u03c40, the time invariance is spontaneously broken and thus there is a zero mode in the fluctuations about a chosen bounce solution. The integral over the fluctuations in the zero-mode direction can be traded for an integral over the collective coordinate; this amounts to adding up all the degenerate fundamental bounces of the same type. Now each bounce solution can be viewed as a point on\nthe real hyperplane as long as the degeneracy characterized by \u03c40 is taken into account properly. Like the zero-dimensional case associated with x0\u00f0\u03c4\u00de, xL\u00f0\u03c4; \u03c40\u00de, and xR\u00f0\u03c4; \u03c40\u00de, we have three relevant Lefschetz thimbles J L, J 0, and J R that are composed of the steepest-descent paths passing through them. In general, the steepest-descent paths passing through a stationary point za\u00f0\u03c4\u00de can be obtained by solving the gradient flow equation [13]\n\u2202z\u00f0\u03c4; u\u00de \u2202u \u00bc \u03b4S\u00bdz\u00f0\u03c4; u\u00de \u03b4z\u00f0\u03c4; u\u00de\nand its complex conjugate. Here u \u2208 R and the boundary condition is z\u00f0\u03c4;u\u00bc\u2212\u221e\u00de\u00bc za\u00f0\u03c4\u00de. Denoting h\u00bdz \u00bc\u2212ReS\u00bdz , one can check that \u2202h=\u2202u \u2264 0. The real part of \u2212S\u00bdz decreases as we move away from the stationary point along the path given by z\u00f0\u03c4; u\u00de (see Refs. [13,22]). The present situation is much simpler. To identify the\nsteepest-descent paths passing through the fundamental stationary points we consider the eigenvalue equation on the real hyperplane\n\u00bd\u2212\u22022\u03c4 \u00fe V 00\u00f0xa\u00f0\u03c4\u00de\u00de fai \u00f0\u03c4\u00de \u00bc \u03bbai fai \u00f0\u03c4\u00de; where a \u00bc 0;L;R. The fluctuation operators \u2212\u22022\u03c4 \u00fe V 00\u00f0xa\u00de are generalizations of Hessian matrices. In the tangential space near xa\u00f0\u03c4\u00de the eigenfunctions ffai g provide a basis. For the cases \u03bbai > 0 (positive mode), \u03bb a i \u00bc 0 (zero mode), and \u03bbai < 0 (negative mode), fai generates two downward, flat, and upward paths with respect to the \u201cheight function\u201d h\u00bdx \u00bc \u2212ReS\u00bdx . [Here the two paths generated by fai join at the stationary point xa\u00f0\u03c4\u00de and form a continuous curve.] Therefore, non-negative modes generate steepest-descent paths that still lie on the real hyperplane of the configuration space. For a negative mode one must look into the subcomplex plane whose real axis is generated by that negative mode. Associated with the negative mode, the steepest-descent paths leave the stationary point and go to the upper and lower imaginary directions on that subcomplex plane, in analogy with the hyperbolas in Fig. 2. It is well known in the context of false vacuum decay [18]\nthat there is only one negativemode for the fluctuations about each bounce solution while there is no negative mode about the trivial solution. Therefore, all steepest-descent flows passing through x0\u00f0\u03c4\u00de lie on the real line. ForJ L (J R), there are two steepest-descent paths that do not lie on the real\nhyperplane. Similarly, we only pick one of them, defining J L=R;\u2212 and J L=R;\u00fe. Aside from the two fundamental bounces, there are\nmultiple-bounce solutions that form stationary points, whose contribution to the path integral in the diluteinstanton approximation is a combination of n1 left-type bounces and n2 right-type bounces, which are separated by intervals much larger than the duration of each single bounce [18,23]. We label these multibounces by \u00f0n1; n2\u00de. Denote the partition function evaluated on J L=R;\u2212 near the single-bounce xL=R including the collective coordinate integrated over as ZPTL=R;\u2212. Then the partition function evaluated on the thimble J \u00f0n1;n2\u00de;\u2212 passing through the multibounce \u00f0n1; n2\u00de has the form\nZPT\u00f0n1;n2\u00de;\u2212 \u00bc ZPT0 n1!n2!

The factor n1! or n2! is due to the symmetry when exchanging the positions of the bounces of the same type. Then for an n bounce, we have\nZPTn;\u2212 \u00bc X\nn1\u00fen2\u00bcn ZPT\u00f0n1;n2\u00de;\u2212:\nThe full partition function can be expanded as\nZPT \u00bc ZPT0 \u00fe X n ZPTn;\u2212\n\u00bc exp ZPTL;\u2212 ZPT0 \u00fe Z PT R;\u2212 ZPT0 \u00fe logZPT0 : \u00f010\u00de\nIn the full ZPT , all the fundamental stationary points are completely entangled with each other because of the multibounce configurations. In logZPT , they \u201cdecouple\u201d from each other and have one-to-one correspondence to the three stationary points in the simple D \u00bc 0 case (see Fig. 2). Similarly, the Hermitian partition function ZHerm can also be put in exponential form with logZHerm playing a fundamental role; the latter is given by connected Feynman diagrams. This, together with insights obtained from the D \u00bc 0 case, motivates us to conjecture the relation (1) between logZPT and logZHerm. This relation indicates that the energy of the non-Hermitian \u2212gx4 theory can be calculated from the Hermitian \u03bbx4 theory via (2). Next, we partly check (2), and also relation (1), by\ncomparing the imaginary parts on the lhs and rhs for the ground-state energy. Substituting (10) into (9) gives\nImEPT0 \u00bc \u2212 limT\u2192\u221e 1 T Im ZPTL;\u2212 ZPT0 \u00fe Z PT R;\u2212 ZPT0 ; \u00f011\u00de\nPT -SYMMETRIC \u2212g\u03c64 THEORY PHYS. REV.

Imaginary parts from nonperturbative stationary points\nWe now evaluate \u00f0ZPTL=R;\u2212=ZPT0 \u00de. To integrate over the Gaussian fluctuations on a Lefschetz thimble about a saddle point, one usually needs to solve the flow equations that determine the tangential space about the stationary point on the thimble [13]. However, as mentioned above, our case is much simpler and the well-known formula for false-vacuum decay rates applies [22]. The integral over fluctuations can be expressed in terms of functional determinants of the Euclidean fluctuation operators:\nZPTL=R;\u2212 ZPT0 \u00bc i 2 T SE\u00bdxL=R 2\u03c0 1=2\n\u00d7 det0\u00bd\u2212\u22022\u03c4 \u00fe V 00\u00f0xL=R\u00f0\u03c4\u00de\u00de det \u00bd\u2212\u22022\u03c4 \u00fe V 00\u00f0x0\u00de \u22121=2e\u2212SE\u00bdxL=R : \u00f012\u00de\nHere, the prime on det indicates that the zero mode is excluded when evaluating the functional determinant. The integral over the fluctuations in the zero-mode direction can be traded for an integral over the collective coordinate [24], giving the factor T ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi SE\u00bdxL;R =2\u03c0 p in the above equation, where \u201c\u00fe\u201d corresponds to the left-type bounce and \u201c\u2212\u201d to the right-type bounce. The functional determinants can be calculated using the\npowerful Gelfand-Yaglom theorem [25]. The results with the zero modes removed are given in Ref. [19] for the kinktype solutions and in Ref. [22] for the bounce-type solutions. For our case, we have\ndet0\u00bd\u2212\u22022\u03c4 \u00fe V 00\u00f0xL=R\u00f0\u03c4\u00de\u00de det \u00bd\u2212\u22022\u03c4 \u00fe V 00\u00f0x0\u00de \u00bc \u2212 1 12m2 :\nSubstituting the above result into (12), we obtain\n\u2212 lim T\u2192\u221e\n1 T Im ZPTL=R;\u2212 ZPT0 \u00bc \u2213m2 ffiffiffiffiffiffi 2m \u03c0g s e\u22124m 3=\u00f03g\u00de: \u00f013\u00de\nBelow, we observe the same imaginary parts from the rhs of (2)."

In particular, for the ground-state energy, we have\nE0;Herm\u00f0\u03bb\u00de \u00bc m 2 \u00fem 2 X\u221e n\u00bc1 An \u03bb 4m3 n ; \u00f014\u00de\nwhere An have the asymptotic behaviors An \u223cffiffiffi 6\np \u00f0\u22121\u00den\u00fe13n\u0393\u00f0n\u00fe 1\u00de=\u03c03=2. Taking the Borel sum of the above series and analytically continuing \u03bb to \u2212g i0\u00fe (g > 0) would give rise to imaginary parts in E0;Herm\u00f0\u2212g i0\u00fe\u00de. These imaginary parts are only sensitive to the large-order behavior of An.

Thus, there is indeed a correspondence between the imaginary parts on the lhs and rhs in (2) applied to the ground-state energy. Note that we again have the correspondence J L;\u2212 \u2194 \u2212g \u2212 i0\u00fe; J R;\u2212 \u2194 \u2212g\u00fe i0\u00fe in comparing the imaginary parts. To generalize the above analysis to D > 1, one can simply replace x\u00f0\u03c4\u00de \u2192 \u03c6\u00f0x\u00de and use the corresponding higher-dimensional action. Again, there are three fundamental bounce solutions \u03c60\u00f0x\u00de, \u03c6L\u00f0x\u00de, and \u03c6R\u00f0x\u00de. The previous analysis is still valid, so we conjecture that the relation (1) also holds for D > 1 [27]."

            "text": "In search of physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, the use of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians has only recently been used in model building [1]. In this paper we have proposed a new approach to study nonHermitian PT -symmetric theories, in which one searches for relations between quantities in the non-Hermitian and the corresponding Hermitian theories. We have focused on the partition functions for the \u2212g\u03c64 theory, but there is no reason, in principle, why similar relations for other theories (for example, for \u03f5 \u2260 2) and for other quantities cannot be constructed. This approach opens a new avenue to explore non-Hermitian PT -symmetric theories. The path-integral formulation we have adopted to build\nthe central relation (1) is very general, and the relation may hold for spacetime dimension D \u2265 1. This relation immediately implies that the energy spectrum for the PT -symmetric \u2212g\u03c64 theory is real. Of course, (1) remains a conjecture that has only been partly checked by comparing\nAI, BENDER, and SARKAR PHYS. REV. D 106, 125016 (2022)\n125016-6\nthe imaginary parts on the lhs and rhs of (2) for the groundstate energy. Our analysis is also related to work on resurgence and the analysis of large-order behavior in perturbation theory [28]. Given the challenge, it is important to use all complementary approaches to understand the predictions concerning PT -symmetric field theory in D \u00bc 4 spacetime."
