This study investigated variousmicroorganisms isolated from the rhizosphere ofOryza sativa L. in order to inhibitMagnaporthe oryzae cause of rice blast, by direct and indirect mode of action. The results indicated that Bacillus vallismortis strain TU\u2013Orga21 significantly reduced M. oryzae mycelium growth and deformed the hyphal structures. The effects of biosurfactant TU\u2013 Orga21 was studied against M. oryzae spore development. The dose of \u22655% v/v biosurfactant significantly inhibited the germ tubes and appressoria formation. The biosurfactants were evaluated as surfactin and iturin A by Matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization dual time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry. Under greenhouse conditions, priming the biosurfactant three times before M. oryzae infection significantly accumulated endogenous salicylic acid, phenolic compounds, and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) during the infection process of M. oryzae. The SR-FT-IR spectral changes from the mesophyll revealed higher integral area groups of lipids, pectins, and proteins amide I and amide II in the elicitation sample. Furthermore, scanning electron microscope revealed appressorium and hyphal enlargement in un-elicitation leaves whereas appressorium formation and hyphal invasion were not found in biosurfactantelicitation at 24 h post inoculation. The biosurfactant treatment significantly mitigated rice blast disease severity. Therefore, B. vallismortis can be a promising novel biocontrol agent which contains the preformed active metabolites for a rapid control of rice blast by a direct action against pathogen and by boosting plant immunity.\nKEYWORDS\nplant health, lipopeptide biosurfactant, biotic stress, phytohormone, plant-immunity, sustainable agriculture, plant\u2013microbe interaction, rice disease\nfrontiersin.org01"

            "text": "Rice (Oryza sativa L.) production is negatively affected by various factors, such as poor soil quality, mineral deficiency, pests, and diseases, among others, ultimately reducing rice yield (Timsina et al., 2018). One of the major diseases of rice is blast caused by Magnaporthe oryzae (Howard and Valent, 1996). The rice blast disease is widespread across Southeast Asia and Japan and is responsible for yield losses of 20%\u201350% on average and even up to 100% in severe cases (Saleh et al., 2014). In Thailand, rice blast is a serious threat to rice production systems because of favorable climatic conditions to disease spread (Kawasaki and Herath, 2018). Therefore, reducing the prevalence and severity of rice blast is a priority for improving the yield and reducing the losses in Thai rice production. At present, the major control methods for rice blast rely on the application of synthetic chemicals, such as captan, carbendazim, thiram, or tricyclazole (Kongcharoen et al., 2020). However, these components may negatively affect humans and the environment. Therefore, novel bioproducts must be explored to control rice blast.\nCurrently, biocontrol of rice diseases using microorganisms, biomass, or crude extracts of microorganisms is an exciting new avenue in the development of biofungicides, which are safe for humans, animals, and the environment. These agents hold the potential to control plant diseases through promoting antibiotic production, competition, parasitism, and plant health (K\u00f6hl et al., 2019; Khanna et al., 2019). In addition, synthesizing various antimicrobial agents or toxins in order to directly attack the pathogens also activates the systemic resistance mechanisms of plants and enhances the defense enzyme properties (Khanna et al., 2021; Abdelaziz et al., 2023).\nBacillus species are potential candidates for developing biofungicides as well as a method to combat bacterial rice pathogens since they produce multifarious active compounds and strong antimicrobial activity such as lipopeptides antibiotics (Hashizume and Nishimura, 2008; Sharma and Thakur, 2020; Ngalimat et al., 2021). Lipopeptides are a group of antimicrobial metabolites composed of surfactin, lichenycin, iturin, and fengycin. These substances affect cellular integrity and can destroy the fungal membrane (Romero et al., 2007). According to Zhang and Sun (2018), cyclic lipopeptides and fengycin produced by Bacillus subtilis 155 can damage rice membrane, inhibiting M. grisea hyphal growth (Zhang and Sun, 2018). Similarly , B. amyloliquefaciens S170 and B. pumilus S9 can colonize rice plants to protect them against M. oryzae by producing proteases, siderophores, cellulases, and volatile compounds (Sha et al., 2020).\nMoreover, lipopeptide substances secreted by Bacillus sp. are involved in the elicitation of induced systemic resistance (ISR) to inhibit a wide range of plant pathogens such as fungi, bacteria, nematodes, insects, and viral vectors (Jourdan et al., 2009; Malviya et al., 2020). ISR is a systemic means of inducing preconditioned resistance through prior infection or biotic treatment. Preconditioning induces resistance, rendering the host less susceptible to subsequent infection and blocking the spread of infection in plant tissues (Romera et al., 2019).

Following infection, endogenous levels of SA increase locally, thereby systemically enhancing plant defense mechanisms through the shikimic acid pathway and producing phenolic compounds in plant cell walls and lignin in response to a pathogen attack (Mandal et al., 2010). Moreover, according to Sedla\u0301ro\u030cva\u0301 and Lebeda (2001), rapid accumulation of phenolic compounds was associated with a hypersensitive response (HR) to downy mildew in lettuce (Sedla\u0301ro\u030cva\u0301 and Lebeda, 2001). Furthermore, in groundnut, plant growthpromoting rhizobacterial (PGPR) bioformulation enhanced the expression of defense enzymes and pathogenesis-related proteins against collar rot via augmenting the enzymatic activity of phenolics (Senthilraja et al., 2013)\nAlthough beneficial microbes, such as Bacillus species, have been proven to effectively suppress M. oryzae, the biocontrol potential of their multiple modes of action against pathogens has not been fully exploited as yet. Therefore, the objective of the present study was to explore the potential benefits of microbes for the inhibition of M. oryzae, their antimicrobial compounds, and their direct inhibiting potential on M. oryzae spore development in parallel with stimulation of the plant defense intermedia including endogenous salicylic acid, phenolic compound, and H2O2 accumulation. Moreover, we also analyzed the biochemical changes including lipid, pectin, amides I, amides II, lignin, and polysaccharides in rice plants during M. oryzae infection."

Moreover, such microorganisms have been exploited as eco\u2013friendly substitutes for pesticides, as they produce antimicrobial compounds and activate plant immunity to combat a broad range of plant pathogens. Most studies addressing beneficial microorganisms have explored their antimicrobial activities or plant defense induction\nFrontiers in Plant Science 10\npotential. Therefore, in the present study, we analyzed the control ability of five representative microorganisms isolates from paddy fields near the rhizospheric region against rice blast through both direct and indirect antagonism.\nB. vallismortis exhibited potent antagonistic activity against M. oryzae (>50%), as determined based on the production of antimicrobial substances. Furthermore, we investigated the ability of the B. vallismortis biosurfactant to inhibit M. oryzae development and observed that at high concentrations, the biosurfactant can effectively suppress spore germination and appressorium development in M. oryzae. These findings are consistent with previous reports that lipopeptide biosurfactants from B. subtilis inhibited the germination of M. oryzae\u2014the causal agent of wheat blast (Chakraborty et al., 2020). In previous studies, different Bacillus strains, including B. subtilis, B. cereus, B. amyloliquefaciens, B. licheniformis, and B. pumilus, have been applied as biocontrol agents against rice blast for organic and sustainable farming. For instance, B. vallismortis R2 could be used as an alternative to combat several plant pathogenic fungi, including Alternaria sp., Rhizoctonia oryzae, Fusarium sp., Colletotrichum sp., Helminthosporium sp., and Magnaporthe grisea (Kaur et al., 2015; Sha et al., 2020). In addition, B. vallismortis, which produce numerous antimicrobial bioactive metabolites, such as thermostable alkalophilic cellulose, bacillomycin D, surfactins, iturins, and fengycins, has been tested for its biocontrol properties (Zhao et al., 2010; Kaur et al., 2017).\nA B\nFIGURE 7 The hydrogen peroxide activity in \u2018KDML 105\u2019 treated with biosurfactant following Magnaporthe oryzae infection. (A) hydrogen peroxide content and (B) relative increase in hydrogen peroxide content.\nA B\nfrontiersin.org\nOur MALDI\u2013TOF/TOF MS analysis of the B. vallismortis biosurfactant revealed the production of two major classes of lipopeptide antibiotics based on secondary metabolites, including iturin A and surfactin. The groups of peaks at m/z values between 1,000 and 1,074 correspond to surfactins and those between 1,076 and 1,150 correspond to iturins (Vater et al., 2002). Iturin A peak in the sample was detected at 1,080 m/z, consistent with its standard (1,080m/z). Surfactin peak in the sample was detected at 1,066m/z, close to its standard (1,059 m/z). The surfactin peak was different from its standard, although it was still in the range of surfactin species (Vater et al., 2002; Hoefler et al., 2012).\nIturins have been identified as antifungal substances that degrade the cell wall, inhibit substance exchange and metabolic processes, and lower viscoelastic fluid pressure in fungal cells (Jiang et al., 2020). The antifungal mechanism of iturin lipopeptides is associated with their interaction in the cytoplasmic membrane, which increases potassium permeability (Maget-Dana and Peypoux, 1994). Furthermore, surfactins destroy the internal structure of cells through digesting the\nFrontiers in Plant Science 11\ncytoplasm and organelles (Xiao et al., 2021). Iturins and surfactins not only exhibit a strong antifungal activity but also act as bioactive molecules to induce plant defense (Raaijmakers et al., 2010). Several studies have reported that lipopeptides, in addition to iturins, surfactins, and fengycins, activate plant ISR, through which the gene expression of defense proteins, including phenylalanine lyase, peroxidases peroxidases, and other pathogenesis\u2013related (PR) proteins, is promoted. This mechanism is essentially responsible for the innate immunization to inhibit pathogens in different plants. Previous studies have demonstrated that lipopeptides, as products of bacterial biosurfactants, activate specific plant defense pathways against pathogens, such as pathways against Colletotrichum gloeosporioides in strawberry, pathways against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum in tomato, and pathways against M. oryzae in rice (Yamamoto et al., 2015; Farzand et al., 2019; Lam et al., 2021).\nThe pivotal roles of the B. vallismortis biosurfactant in plant immune interactions was further investigated in the present study by analyzing the changes in host defense intermediate biochemicals\nA B\nC D\nE\nFIGURE 8 SR-FT-IR spectra of mesophyll in rice leaf tissue.

Spraying the B. vallismortis biosurfactant three times before pathogen inoculation resulted in the establishment of plant immunological parameters, including increases in endogenous SA and phenolic levels (p< 0.05).\nSA, jasmonic acid (JA), and ethylene (ET) are important hormonal signal molecules involved in biotic stress responses during plant\u2013pathogen interactions. Typically, SA\u2013mediated defense responses play a central role in local and systemic\u2013 acquired resistance against biotrophic and hemi\u2013biotrophic pathogens, whereas ET/JA\u2013mediated responses contribute to defense against necrotrophic pathogens (Bari and Jones, 2009; D. Tamaoki et al., 2013). M. oryzae is a hemi\u2013biotrophic fungus that causes rice blast; it assumes an initial biotrophic stage during which the plant immune system is suppressed, followed by the necrotrophic stage that promotes plant cell death (Fernandez and Orth, 2018).\nThe SA pathway is the dominant signaling cascade under pathogen attacks due to the presence of communication channels that can promote generation of energy and synthesis of potential intermediates and enzymes to inhibit pathogens (Koo et al., 2020). Studies on defense responses of multiple plant species, including rice, soybean, and tobacco, have reported that pathogen infection leads to SA accumulation (Yalpani et al., 1993; Bawa et al., 2019; Liang et al., 2022). At the early stages of pathogen infection, plants recognize and activate the defense signals as well as induce damage\u2013 associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), including extracellular protein fragments, peptides, nucleotides, and amino acids (Hou\nFrontiers in Plant Science 12\net al., 2019). The transcription factors for PR genes activate SA to mediate host response in infected plant cells (Hou et al., 2019). Kawagoe et al. (2015) characterized the signaling pathways of ISR stimulated by lipopeptides in Arabidopsis through the SA and JA signaling pathways, which activated the transcription of defense genes (Kawagoe et al., 2015). Moreover, SA accumulated around the infected area generates HRs at the initial infection site (Daisuke Wildermuth et al., 2001; Tamaoki et al., 2013). Lakkis et al. (2019) reported that Pseudomonas fluorescens is an inducer of ISR in grapevine, which activates both immune response and priming phenomenon under Botrytis cinerea infection; this event is related to the constitutively enhanced expression of SA\u2013related genes and increased total phenolic content (Lakkis et al., 2019).\nThe involvement of phenolic compounds in the defense reaction is a crucial physiological function in several plants, such as lettuce, banana, and rice plants, to offer resistance against multiple biotic stressors (Sedla\u0301ro\u030cva\u0301 and Lebeda, 2001; Dallagnol et al., 2011; Fortunato et al., 2012; Pratyusha, 2022). According to our results, the total phenolic content showed the highest increase in the 20% v/v biosurfactant treatment. In contrast, in the 30% v/v biosurfactant treatment, the magnitude of increase was lower. This may be because B. vallismortis produces iturin A and surfactin in the biosurfactant, which produce a direct antimicrobial effect against the pathogen; thus, the inoculum should have a lower density than in the other treatments. Similarly, H2O2 did not produce the strongest effect as it is a defense intermediary contributing to program cell death (PCD) under pathogen attack.\nfrontiersin.org\nThese observations are consistent with previous reports that phenolic production is linked to SA\u2013induced resistance responses, which are often augmented after a pathogen attack leading to HR and contributing to subsequent cell death (Wallis and Galarneau, 2020). Betsuyaku et al. (2018) reported higher levels of SA in concentric patterns of cellular responses in effector\u2013triggered immunity. PAMP\u2013triggered immunity induces an HR and localized PCD to inhibit pathogen spread, which effectively protects the plant tissues from disease severity (Betsuyaku et al., 2018; Radojic\u030cic\u0301 et al., 2018). In the present study, the comparison of H2O2\u2013mediated PCD and initiation of defense responses againstM. oryzae infection between treated and untreated samples revealed significant temporal differences in the accumulation of H2O2. This result confirms that in the present experiment, plant defense activity exclusively occurred after M. oryzae infection. The higher H2O2 activity suggests that reactive oxygen species (ROS) contribute to the disruption of the electron transport chain at the early stages of infection (6\u201312 hpi) produced by elicitation with biosurfactant. The higher H2O2 levels may enhance the ability of cells to detoxify H2O2, which may generate damage\u2013related signals and activate transcriptional regulators of PCD\u2013related genes. PCD under host\u2013 pathogen interactions in the elicitation affects the rapid inhibition of pathogen development. These results are consistent with the plant timing defense initiation theory and corroborate the observations of Ye et al. (2021), who reported increased ROS concentrations after pathogen infection, leading to a change in the antioxidant status of cells and induction of plant responses in terms of immunity\u2013related cell death (Ye et al., 2021).\nFrontiers in Plant Science 13\nThis indirect inhibitory effect of the biosurfactant causes a shift in intracellular biochemical elements, which were detected using SR\u2013FT\u2013IR microspectroscopy. The biomolecule\u2013related intensities from average spectra revealed significantly higher agglomeration of Amide I (1,600\u20131,800 cm-1) and Amide II (1,470\u20131,570 cm-1) proteins. A plant protein peptide bond is an amide group as well as a type of endogenous factor in disease resistance to encourage plant\u2013microbe interaction (Liu et al., 2022). Plant peptides induce immune responses that are established at the receptor level of plant peptides in response to pathogen invasion, including the induction of defense\u2013related phytoalexin, lignification, and PR proteins (Hu et al., 2018; Kumar et al., 2018). Moreover, significantly less polysaccharides (1,200\u2013900 cm-1), such as carbohydrates and sugar, were accumulated in biosurfactant\u2013treated samples. This may be because during the infection process, plants adapt or alter their energy storage to trigger defense responses against pathogens (Tauzin and Giardina, 2014). We further examined the M. oryzae infection process on leaves using SEM. Elicitation of rice plants with the biosurfactant disrupted the development process of M. oryzae, confirming that the biosurfactant produced an indirect inhibitory effect on host plant infection (Figure 11)."
