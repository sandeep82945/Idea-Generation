    "abstractText": "The relationship between non-communicable diseases and eating behaviour has long been attributed to a surplus of food and energy. However, the increase in the prevalence of non-communicable disease and their underlying low-grade inflammatory milieu among people of low socioeconomic status has highlighted the existence of a confounding factor. In this work, we aim to study the effect of lysine deficiency on some inflammatory markers in the absence or presence of an inflammatory insult (lipopolysaccharide (LPS)). For this purpose, thirty-two 5-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats were randomly distributed into four groups: (1) control diet, (2) control diet\u00feLPS, (3) lysine-deficient diet and (4) lysine-deficient diet\u00fe LPS. Groups were only allowed their experimental diets for 4 weeks, during which LPS (50 \u03bcg/kg) or saline injections were administered intraperitoneally three times per week. The study showed that lysine deficiency blunted growth and body compartments development, decreased albumin production and elevated liver C-reactive protein (CRP) expression, independently of IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2, the main precursors of CRP. Also, the insufficient levels of lysine in the diet increased hyperactivity and triggered an anxiety-like behaviour, exacerbated with LPS. This work presents evidence that various physiological changes are associated with the absence of a sufficient amount of lysine in the diet and can potentially increase the risk factor for diseases. Thus, the increment in non-communicable disease among the low socio-economic status populations, who heavily rely on cereals as a main source of protein, can be, at least partially, blamed on low lysine availability in diets.",

This comes alongwithmany reports showing higher levels of inflammatory markers, notably C-reactive protein (CRP), among subpopulations with low socio-economic status(2\u20134), affirming the dogma that low-grade inflammation plays a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of many diseases(5).\nThe increased prevalence of non-communicable diseases and their attributable deaths can be, at least partially, explained by some dietary factors associated with the nutrition westernisation phase(6). This dietary pattern is characterised by high fat, refined carbohydrates and processed foods(7). Due to the high cost of animal proteins, low socio-economic status communities have adopted the westernised pattern but kept their primary protein intake from plant sources(7), mainly cereals, which sometimes reached more than 80 % of the daily protein intake(8).\nCereals (rice, wheat andmaize) significantly contribute to the total energy intake of many populations; nonetheless, their\nproteins do not contain a sufficient amount of lysine(9), an essential amino acid that cannot be produced by the body and needs to be procured from the diet(10). This makes lysine the first limiting amino acid in cereals(10). For instance, wheat shares the lowest lysine content of 22\u201335 mg/g of protein, followed by rice (30\u201336 mg/g) and maize (28\u201342 mg/g)(11), while animal products such asmeat, poultry, fish and dairy products have high lysine content, more than 2\u00b77-fold the amount found in plantbased products(8). When the digestible indispensable amino acid score (DIAAS) was evaluated in food items, the lowest DIAAS range was attributed to cereals (1 % to 77 %), with lysine as the limiting indispensable amino acid, followed by legumes and nuts (43 % to 105 % and 83 % to 86 %, respectively), and animal-based products (ranging from 80 % and reaching 144 %)(12).\nIn animals, adding 5 % casein (animal-based protein) to the wheat gluten diet was found to improve the quality of protein and prevent the decline in weight gain, food intake and feed\n* Corresponding author: Omar A. Obeid, email omar.obeid@aub.edu.lb\nAbbreviation: GLM, general linear model; LPS, lipopolysaccharide.\nefficiency(13). On the other hand, exclusively consuming incomplete gluten proteins, Sprague Dawley rats had defects in growth, development and energy efficiency(14).\nSeveral lysine fortification or supplementation trials were shown to produce paramount effects at different levels. When the impact of the fortification of wheat flour with lysine was assessed in Northern China, Zhao et al. demonstrated a significant increment in plasma levels of prealbumin, IgG, IgA, IgM and complement factor 3 (C3)(15), which reflects a better nutritional and immunological status. Similar results were also shown in other settings(16\u201318). Additionally, in a study on rats, lysine supplementation of gluten diets significantly increased weight gain and growth and improved plasma albumin levels(14). Moreover, lysine was also shown to have significant roles at the central levels in modulating anxiety. A 3-month randomised double-blind lysine fortification of wheat reported reduced chronic anxiety among some Syrian communities(19). Also, oral lysine, along with arginine, reduced traits of anxiety and salivary levels of cortisol and chromogranin-A among healthy Japanese adults(20).\nThe relationship between lysine and general health outcomes displays a potential role of lysine deficiency, among low socioeconomic status communities that rely on cereals, in increasing risks of developing non-communicable diseases. We hypothesise that the lack of a sufficient amount of lysine in a dietmediates low-grade inflammation in the absence of infectious stimuli; and that the inflammatory profile in a triggered immune reaction would be altered in the case of lysine deficiency. To our knowledge, this is the first study that aims at studying the effect of lysine deficiency on some inflammatory markers in the context of inflammatory insult induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in growing rats. With a similar nutrient metabolism and inflammatory responses to humans, young male Sprague Dawley rats were used in this study and closely monitored for their growth, metabolisms and behaviour."

In fact, lysine operates as a building block for protein synthesis as it serves as an important precursor of the signalling pathway for the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)(33). In addition, lysine deficiency was found to increase the fractional rate of proteolysis, leading to more loss in muscle mass(34).\nFig. 5. qRTPCR results showing the relative mRNA expression of MyD88, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6 and IL-6R in the liver and the spleen of rats fed a control diet or a 60% lysine-deficient diet in the presence or absence of LPS challenge (n= 5 per group).

LPS, lipopolysaccharide.\nniversity Press\nWhile lysine in diet contributed to the main anthropometric differences, LPS has also conferred a minor yet significant effect. It has been shown that in the case of any immune response (triggered by LPS), amino acid repartitioning takes place, favouring the activation of the immune system and compromising protein synthesis related to growth(35). In addition, proinflammatory cytokines can detrimentally affect the thyroid gland and consequently blunt growth and development(36). In line, immune reactions are known to increase lipolysis, resulting in a decrease in fat mass and an upsurge of free fatty acid in the circulation. This phenomenon can happen through the binding of LPS (via its lipid A moiety) to its receptor toll-like receptor 4 and stimulating its downstream inflammatory pathway(37). Another potential lipolytic route is through the inositol-requiring protein 1, a component of the endoplasmic reticulum stress whose activation is insulin-independent(38). The lipolytic cycles, feeding the circulation with free fatty acids, further stimulate the inflammatory outcomes through toll-like receptor 4(39), dragging the system into a vicious cycle. It is worth noting that despite the change in body fat mass, the fat percentage among groups at baseline and end point did not change.\nInterestingly, the difference in body weight and composition was not related to the total energy intake (which was similar) but to energy efficiency. In fact, the effect of the amino acid restriction on energy intake depends on the magnitude of the deficiency. While a 75 % lysine deficiency increased feed intake and decreased body weight, Kim et al. reported no difference in both parameters when deficiency is as low as 50 %(40). In this work, the energy expended was superior to the energy used for growth and development, and this can be explained as follows. First, rats that consumed lysine-deficient diets were hyperactive, and this behaviour was exacerbated with LPS administration. Thus, more energy was consumed to support their increased physical activity. Second, when sufficient amounts of essential amino acids are unavailable for protein synthesis, more amino acids will remain in circulation. As a protective mechanism against amino acid accumulation, the body starts oxidising more amino acids which results in an increase in energy expenditure and a general catabolic state, hindering fat and lean mass accumulation. Consequently, the amount of energy used for growth and weight gain would decrease. The increase in energy expenditure and amino acid oxidation following a low-quality-protein diet is not restricted to lysine deficiency only(14,41,42).\nThe size of the organs of the rats confirmed the body composition findings. Spleens were enlarged in the presence of LPS, showing an active immune status, which was in line with other studies(43,44). The similarity in fat percentage in dry livers between the groups implies that the increase in the liver size with LPS is not attributed to an ectopic lipid accumulation but to the liver involvement in the body\u2019s immune response(45). Nevertheless, the duration of exposure (4 weeks), dose of LPS (150 \u03bcg/kg/week) and time of euthanasia (24-h post last LPS injection) were insufficient to show any morphological changes or mononuclear cell infiltration in the livers. However, it is confirmed that both LPS administration and lysine deficiency have caused functional alterations.\nA decrease in body fat gain paralleled the decline in epididymal adipose tissue weight, which was attributed to the lack of lysine. The adipose tissue dynamics also differed among the groups, and this was seen at a microscopic level. The adipocytes were more numerous and smaller in size in the lysinedeficient diet, and these alterations pose serious cardiovascular implications(46), believing they are associated with higher levels of circulating free fatty acids."

            "text": "An interesting characteristic of the lysine-deficient diet was the drop in lipid profile (except for the LDL) that is widely reported in the community among malnourished populations(47,48). Remarkably, lysine is largely needed for the synthesis of lipoproteins(49). Also, LPS worked differently with the diets manipulating lipid profiles; it increased the concentrations in combination with the control but not lysine-deficient diet. In a well-nourished status, high levels of NEFA induced by LPS(50) are esterified to plasma TAG, a mechanism to reduce the cytotoxic effect of NEFA.\nAnother remarkable alteration caused by lysine deficiency was the increase in chloride levels. When the pH of the medium decreases, the total unbound NEFA concentration increases, exacerbating the health status(51).\nProtein and amino acid metabolisms change drastically duringmalnutrition. Due to the low lysine content in diet, plasma lysine dropped to a similar extent (50 to 60 % decrease). In addition, the deficient rats witnessed a fall in most other amino acids which is considered a hallmark associated with malnutrition(52). It is worth mentioning that, unlike the decrease in levels seen with the majority of amino acids, histidine and serine increased by about 50 % and threonine by 2\u00b75-fold with the deficient diet. The increase in threonine levels (and at a lower extent in histidine and serine) in lysine deficiencywas previously reported in the literature(53\u201357) and could be explained by a hindered utilisation and/or oxidation of these amino acids.\nIn addition, amino acid concentration (essential, non-essential and total) was comparable between groups, showing how the body compensates for the drop in some amino acids with the increase in others. In harmony with the hypothesis that affirms a relationship between serum amino acid concentration and appetite(58), similar levels of circulating amino acids might have contributed to comparable feed and energy intake. The 60 % lysine deficiency in this work was low to cause the classical malnutrition manifestation but not low enough to alter total amino acid concentration and drop food intake."

            "text": "This study proved an inverse relationship between plasma albumin concentration and liver CRP expression. Some observations (secondary data in most cases) have acknowledged an inverse relationship between albumin and CRP levels in particular cases. Mosli & Mosli(59) showed an inverse association between albuminemia and obesity, which independently elevates CRP(60\u201363). Patients with celiac disease also present alterations in their blood parameters with low levels of albumin(64) and high levels of CRP(65). Nonetheless, some researchers\nniversity Press\nsuggested a CRP (or high-sensitivity CRP) to albumin or prealbumin ratio to identify the activity of some inflammatory diseases(66\u201368).\nInterestingly, the most dominant essential amino acid in the sequence of albumin is lysine(69). Consequently, by diminishing lysine supply through a deficient diet, not enough lysine remains available to produce this big plasma protein. This finding has great clinical implications seeing the major role albumin plays in health and disease(70\u201372). Thiswork also shows that LPS administration was correlated with an increase in albumin levels. This result corresponds to the role of albumin as a carrier protein and an immunemodulator. In fact, LPS can bind to albumin and form a complex that is much less effective in activating toll-like receptor 4 than is LPS-Lipid A(73).\nRemarkably, an exact opposite pattern was reported for liver CRP. Lysine deficiency alone increased liver CRP expression by about 2\u00b75-fold, independently from IL-6 and IL-1\u03b2, the main precursors of CRP(74,75). In fact, albumin is three times the size of CRP (585 amino acids for albumin(76) v. 206 for CRP(77)) with a similar amino acid profile; leucine and lysine are the two most abundant essential amino acids in the CRP composition(78). In brief, under lysine deficiency, the body seems to prioritise the production of small transport proteins requiring less lysine (CRP) at the expense of large proteins (albumin). Therefore, this fact explains the reduction of CRP levels when lysine and leucine were supplemented(79) and albumin regained its initial transport role.\nThe livers and spleens did not display a similar gene expression profile. MyD88, a downstream target of the toll-like receptor 4, and IL-6R mRNA expressions were similar among groups, while IL-6 was not expressed in the liver. The only difference at the hepatic level was the expression of IL-1\u03b2 for the LPS group. It is worth mentioning that among deficient rats, the expression of IL-1\u03b2was similar to the unchallenged group. This clearly states that the liver does not mount a normal reaction to antigens in case of deficiency but prioritises internal regulations. Then again, the spleen exhibitedmore discrepancies between groups, where MyD88, IL-1\u03b2 and IL-6 gene expressions all increased with LPS. In fact, the liver and spleen convey pro-inflammatory cytokine expression at different rates, while hepatic reactions are faster and shorter, the splenic ones are slower and more consistent(80).\nPrevious work in the literature has come in support of our findings. A study on pigs showed that supplementation with functional amino acids improved the system\u2019s defence and immune function(81). Inline, medical records from hospitalised patients with systemic inflammation (CRP> 0\u00b75 mg/dl) proved that when patients were supplemented with essential amino acids, CRP dropped while the immune cells in the circulation increased under inflammatory and infectious conditions(79)."

LPS dose and frequency in this work were not enough to provoke pain, unlike what is commonly reported about LPS-inducing hyperalgesia(82\u201384). Nonetheless, Yirmiya et al. demonstrated\nthat the administration of LPS (200 \u03bcg/kg, which is four times the dose in this study) increased pain sensitivity 2 h after injection but only lasted for about 30 h(85).\nLysine deficiency increased the total distance travelled by the rats and the distance in the periphery, suggesting hyperactive behaviour, which was exacerbated by LPS administration. No effect of LPS was seen when the diet was complete, which suggests a protective role of lysine at a central level against the harm that LPS causes.\nAdditionally, rats on deficient diets spent more time in the corners, which indicates an anxiety-like behaviour. This result seen in session 1 and lost in the subsequent sessions might be attributed to the habituation of the rats, their learning ability and memory that were maintained. It is worth noting that lysine acts as a glutamate precursor in the mammalian central nervous system(86), and a selective reduction of glutamate in the ventral hippocampus is associated with anxiety-like characteristics in rats(87). Also, lysine can work as an antagonist of serotonin receptors in the brain and provide an antidepressant effect, similar to the findings of Cremers et al.(88) In a study on guinea pigs, lysine inhibited the binding of serotonin to its receptor 4 (5-HT4), reducing anxiety-related diarrhoea(89). Moreover, as a carrier protein, albumin binds to amino acids for their transport. Any decrease in plasma albumin level (by a decrease in production) or availability (by an increase in free fatty acids) would be expected to increase the availability of free tryptophan(90) that competes with other large neutral amino acids on their transporters at the blood\u2013brain barrier. Consequently, the imbalance in amino acids in the brain alters the production of the varied neurotransmitters.\nWe acknowledge the importance of conducting the same study on female rats considering the discrepancies in serum albumin concentrations between sexes, especially at a young age(91), and knowing that females have a compensatory mechanism that alleviates the response to endotoxins(92). These sex differences highlight amain limitation of our study. Another limitationwouldbe the lack of prealbumin assessment thatwould support the findings and hypothesis, given its high lysine content(93).\nIn conclusion, this study confirmed that lysine deficiency hinders the production of albumin and stimulates hepatic CRP expression. This status is accompanied by an increase in anxiety-like behaviour, a blunted growth and an alteration in some inflammatory markers\u2019 expressions. Moreover, with LPS insult, lysine deficiency exacerbated hyperactivity, blood and tissue parameters, and modulated the immune response. This project adds to the recent advancements and understanding of the interplay between nutrition and inflammation, shedding light on amino acids and protein quality. It remains to be understood whether other forms of low-quality protein would exhibit similar effects. We believe that the increment in non-communicable disease among the low socio-economic status populations can be, at least partially, blamed on low lysine availability in their diets."
