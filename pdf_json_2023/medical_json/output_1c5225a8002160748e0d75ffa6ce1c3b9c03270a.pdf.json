MSCsderived exosomes (MEXs) can mirror the biological function of their parent cells. Whether MEXs can alleviate GVHD like their parent cells or not is unclear. In this study, we investigate the effects of MEXs on GVHD and graft-versusleukemia (GVL) effect in vitro and in HSCT animal models.\nMethod: MSCs were produced using bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNCs), and MEXs were separated from the supernatants of MSCs. Electron microscopy, western blot, and nanoparticle tracking analysis (NTA) were used to determine the characteristics of MEXs. The immunomodulatory function of MEXs and their effects on GVHD and GVL were examined in vitro and in vivo.\nResult: Like other cell-type derived exosomes, our data revealed that MEXs were also disc-shaped vesicles with a diameter of 100\u2013200 nm under electron microscopy and were positive for the exosomal hallmark proteins. MEXs can notably inhibit the expression of costimulatory molecules and functional cytokine secretion of dendritic cells (DCs). Meanwhile, MEXs can exert suppressive effects on T lymphocyte proliferation and activation. Moreover, MEXs can also encourage the polarization of macrophages toward the M2 type. In animal HSCT models, MEXs can promote the differentiation of Treg cells in spleens, decrease the GVHD score, increase the survival rate of mice, and preserve the cytotoxic antileukemia effects of CD8+ T lymphocytes from recipient mice.\nConclusion: These findings showed that MEXs exert their effects by inhibiting the immunomodulatory function of DCs, macrophages, and T lymphocytes.

            "text": "Graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) is a frequent complication of allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) and is also one of the most important causes of death of HSCT recipients. The allogeneic T lymphocytes from the donor to the recipient are the protagonists that initiate the development of GVHD. On the other hand, donor T cells can also recognize and eradicate residual leukemic cells and induce graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect, which reduces the probability of leukemia recurrence after transplantation. Therefore, a crucial factor in raising the success rate of allo-HSCT is reducing GVHD while maintaining the GVL effect.\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) constitute a subset of nonhematopoietic pluripotent stem cells that can differentiate into osteoblasts, chondrocytes, adipocytes, and other cell types that are frequently used in tissue regeneration and repair. The MSCs can be isolated from bone marrow, umbilical cord, adipose tissue, placenta, and other tissues (1, 2). Their anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties have gained increasing attention in recent years (3\u20135). It was demonstrated that MSCs prevent T cells from differentiating into helper T cells (Th17 and Th1 cells) (6, 7). Inflammatory conditions enhance the potential of MSCs to recruit inflammatory Th17 cells, induce a T regulatory cell phenotype, and enhance IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-10 production by differentiating Th17 cells (6). Jung et al. demonstrated that mesenchymal stromal cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-EVs) exert their therapeutic effects by degrading RORgt at the protein level, leading to Th17 cell depolarization through K63-linked deubiquitination as a Th17 cell inhibitor (8).\nMoreover, MSCs demonstrated their efficacy in GVHD prevention and treatment in allo-HSCT due to their immunoregulatory function. Dotoli et al. reported that patients with steroid-resistant GVHD were treated with third-party MSCs, and 50% of patients showed clinical improvement, 13% had a complete response, and 60.9% had a partial response (9). A meta-\nC-EV, MSC-derived\nived exosome; HSCT,\nersus-host disease; DC,\ne response; PR, partial\ne rate; APC, antigen-\n02\nanalysis showed that the incidence of grade II-IV acute GVHD and chronic GVHD was significantly lower in patients in the MSCs prophylaxis group compared to the control group without MSCs prophylaxis, and patients had a 17% increase in overall survival (10). In addition to suppressing the immune control of GVHD, MSCs promoted the implantation of hematopoietic stem cells, and it was concluded that MSCs are a component of the hematopoietic microenvironment and act as a promoter of hematopoiesis (11). Therefore, MSCs have clinical application prospects in HSCT.\nExosomes (EXOs), the most prevalent type of extracellular vesicle, are tiny vesicles released from eukaryotic cells when the endosomes fuse with the plasma membrane. EXOs have a diameter of 40\u2013100 nm and contain proteins and complex RNAs of parental origin (12). Previous studies have shown that, like MSCs, MSCsderived exosomes (MEXs) or mesenchymal stromal cell-derived extracellular vesicles (MSC-Evs) can also exert suppressive immunomodulatory actions on T lymphocytes and antigenpresenting cells (13\u201315). Additionally, MEXs can inhibit the activation and function of B-lymphocytes while suppressing the secretion of B-cell immunoglobulins (16). Another study showed that MEXs can promote the polarization of macrophages to M2 type cells, which is accompanied by the downregulation of Interferon-g (IFN-g), interleukin-12 (IL-12), and tumor necrosis factor-a (TNF-a) expression and the upregulation of the immunenegative regulator IL-10 (17). Taken together, MEXs can mirror the immunomodulatory functions of their parent MSC cells. In addition, in clinics, MEXs may have several advantages over MSCs, including cell-free nature, mass production, easy preservation, and transportation (18). Therefore, in this study, we will determine whether MEXs, like their parent MSC cells, have comparable therapeutics on GVHD, and examine their effects on GVL in vitro and in animal HSCT models."

To confirm this data, we also examined the CD206 mRNA expression of RAW 264.7 cells treated with MEXs. Our data showed that, like MSCs, MEXs also significantly elevated the CD206 mRNA expression of RAW 264.7 cells (Figure 4B), indicating that MEXs can promote the conversion of M1 to M2-type macrophages in vitro. Whether MEXs could promote macrophage polarization toward M2 in vivo is unclear. The proportion of macrophages expressing CD206 in the peritoneal macrophages from the mice in the MEXs or MSCs groups was examined.

Compared to the PBS control group, the lower levels of TNF-a and the higher levels of IL-5 were observed in mice treated with MEXs (Figures 5D, E). These results were similar to that in the MSCs group, indicating that, like MSCs, MEXs can promote Th1 to Th2 cytokines shift, which may contribute to alleviating the onset of acute GVHD in alloHSCT. Meanwhile, we also examined the effect of MEXs on the differentiation of regulatory T cells (Treg cells). At day 14, the proportion of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg Cells in spleens was detected by flow cytometry. As shown in Figure 5H, the proportion of CD4+CD25+Foxp3+ Treg cells was significantly higher in the MEXs (p<0.001) and MSCs groups (p<0.001) than in the PBS control group, indicating that, like MSCs, MEXs can also exert a critical role in encouraging T lymphocytes to differentiate into Treg cells, which play key roles in suppressing autoimmunity and in maintaining immune homeostasis (23, 24).\nIn the T lymphocyte proliferation assay, donor splenic cells were labeled with CFSE and injected intravenously into irradiated recipients at a density of 1\u00d7107 cells/mouse, and cell division and expansion were examined 5 days after cell injection. The proliferation of T lymphocytes in spleens was analyzed by visualizing CFSE fluorescence with a flow cytometer.

            "text": "One of the main factors contributing to the failure of allogeneic HSCT is acute GVHD, which is one of the most important causes of morbi-mortality after allo-HSCT. Classically, three stages are involved in the development of acute GVHD (25). First, tissue damage from the conditioning regimen mediates the activation of\nB C\nD\nA\nfrontiersin.org\nAPCs. Second, donor T lymphocytes are activated by recipient antigens presented by host APCs. Third, donor T lymphocytes attack target tissues and cause damage. The first phase primarily relates to tissue damage, such as liver and intestine damage from radiotherapy pretreatment prior to transplantation. This promotes the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines and growth factors, such as TNF-a, IFN-g, IL-1, and GM-CSF, which induces adhesion and expression of MHC molecules and promotes the recognition of allogeneic antigens via donor T lymphocytes that uptake the antigen and multiply for activation in the second stage. Duffner et al. used APC (II+/+) expressing MHC II-deficient (II-/-) mice to examine the capacity of DCs and B cells to initiate acute GVHD (resistant to CD4-dependent GVHD). Consequently, injecting host-derived II+/ + DCs or host-derived II+/+ B cells alone was sufficient to produce deadly acute GVHD in II-/- animals and break down GVHD resistance. In contrast, donor CD4+ T lymphocytes could not be activated or tolerated by primitive or LPS-stimulated host-derived II+/+ B cells. These findings implied that donor CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes must first be activated by the host-derived DCs to trigger GVHD (25). Additionally, decreasing the T lymphocytes in donor cells would improve the symptoms of GVHD and alleviate the severity of GVHD. However, donor versus recipient immune reactions also harbored a beneficial effect since they mediated the immunological eradication of residual tumor cells, in the context of the so-called GVL effect, which could eradicate the residual leukemia cells. Therefore, drastically lowering the amount of T lymphocytes would weaken the GVL effect. The third phase is the effector phase, in which various immune cells exert tissue killing against the targeted organs of recipients that do not match the donor MHC type under the regulation of inflammatory factors.\nCurrently, the prevention of acute GVHD is achieved using calcium phosphatase inhibitors, namely, methotrexate, which suppresses donor T lymphocytes in the graft and may also weaken the anti-leukemic effect of the graft, which would increase the relapse and graft failure and thus decrease the survival rate of the patient. Therefore, prevention and treatment of acute GVHD while preserving GVT is the research hotspot in allo-HSCT.\nMSCs have a wide spectrum of immunomodulatory characteristics in addition to stem/histocyte traits. In a noninflammatory setting (low levels of TNF-a and IFN-g), bone\nFrontiers in Immunology 11\nmarrow MSCs adopt a pro-inflammatory phenotype and enhance T lymphocyte response by secreting chemokines to recruit lymphocytes for infection. In an inflammatory setting, MSCs are activated and transformed into an immunosuppressive phenotype, secreting high levels of soluble factors, such as IDO, PGE2, NO, TGF-b1, IL-10, and hepatocyte growth factor. Moreover, MSCs can suppress T lymphocyte activation, prevent Th1 and Th17 cell differentiation, promote macrophage polarization toward M2 for anti-inflammatory effects, and inhibit dendritic cell activation and maturation (26). Depending on their immune properties, MSCs can be used to treat a wide range of disorders, including osteoarthritis, cirrhosis from hepatitis, pulmonary fibrosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and other autoimmune diseases. Recent studies have shown that MSC-based treatment promises great results in acute GVHD, with several clinical trials demonstrating the efficacy of MSCs in steroid-refractory acute GVHD (27, 28).\nAs early as the 1960s, it was observed that there were membrane vesicles in the extracellular space, which were termed extracellular vesicles (EVs). EVs contain membrane molecules, cytoplasmic proteins, and nucleic acid molecules such as DNA and RNA from mother cells. The biological characteristics of EVs are closely related to the proteins and RNAs they contain. EVs participate in important physiological and pathological processes in the body, including antigen presentation, immune response, angiogenesis, and inflammatory response. Exosomes are the main component of EVs, and studies on MSC-EVs mainly refer to MSCs-derived exosomes (MEXs) (29\u201332). Recent studies have shown that MSCEVs and MEXs have similar functions to their parental MSCs and even broader clinical application potential (15, 32, 33). However, the effects of MEXs on immunomodulation and the application potential in acute GVHD are unclear.\nIn the present study, we first characterized the MEXs using electron microscopy and NTA. Our data showed that, like other cell exosomes, the MEXs were also dimpled, with a cup-shaped morphology with size of 40 to 160 nm in diameter, and expressed HSP70, CD9, CD63, and TSG101, as well as were negative for the endoplasmic re t icu lum prote in GRP94. In terms of immunomodulation, studies have shown that MSC-EVs can inhibit the activation of T cells and dendritic cells, inhibit the development and differentiation of Th1 and Th17 cells, and induce\nBA\nC\nfrontiersin.org\nimmune cells to secrete IL-10 and TGF- b immunosuppressive factors, which can inhibit lymphocyte proliferation and induce Treg cell generation (14, 15, 34). As the main component of MSC-EVs, MEXs can exert the immunomodulation function like their parental MSCs. Next, we examined the effects of MEXs on the function of immune cells, such as dendritic cells, T lymphocytes, and macrophages in vitro and found that, like MSCs, MEXs not only inhibited the expression of CD80 and CD86 on dendritic cells (DCs) but also inhibited their functional cytokines IL-6 and IL12p70 secretion, indicating that, like their parent MSCs, MEXs can also suppress the immune activity of DCs in vitro. Studies have shown that microRNAs were significantly enriched in MSC-EVs compared to their parent MSCs. MicroRNAs known to have an impact on DC maturation and function include miR-21-5p, miR142-3p, miR-223-3p, and miR-126-3p (15). MSC-EVs can recapitulate MSC-mediated DC modulation, and microRNAs enclosed with MSC-EVs may represent a novel mechanism through which MSCs modulate DC functions. Meanwhile, another study showed that, as the main component of MSC-EVs, MSCs\u2010derived exosomes (MEXs) can also decrease the surface marker expression in DCs treated with LPS, decrease IL\u20106 release, whereas it can augment IL\u201010 and TGF\u2010b1 release and decrease lymphocyte proliferation in the presence of DCs treated with MEXs (15). Our data are consistent with these studies. Taken together, these findings suggest that, like parental MSCs, MEXs can suppress the function of DCs, indicating that they may be important modulators of DC\u2010induced immune responses.\nDonor T lymphocytes play an important role in the onset of acute GVHD, and because MSCs can suppress T lymphocyte activation, MSCs can be used to treat acute GVHD. In this study, we found that MEXs can significantly decrease CD69 expression of CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes, indicating that, like MSCs, MEXs can also exert activation-inhibitory effects on T lymphocytes in vitro. Moreover, we also found that, like MSCs, MEXs can markedly suppress the proliferation of T lymphocytes in the spleen of mice allo-HSCTmodels. Taken together, our data showed that MEXs can exert suppressive effects on the activation and proliferation of T lymphocytes. Th1/Th2 cells play a critical role in the pathogenesis of GVHD. Some studies have shown that the cytokine profile of effector cells induces predominantly GVL effects with reducing GVHD across MHC and minor histocompatibility antigen barriers, which may be related to a Th1 to Th2 cytokine shift (35\u201338). Donor Th1 cells preferentially secrete type-1 cytokines (IL2, IFN-g, and TNF-a) and induce GVHD, whereas donor Th2 cells, which secrete type-2 cytokines (IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13), could reduce GVHD (39\u201341). Th1 cytokines exert immune activation, enhance the activation and recruitment of macrophages and B cells, and promote cytotoxic T-cell proliferation to induce acute GVHD. However, Th2 cytokines are associated with immunologic tolerance and reduce the production of causative agents of acute GVHD (42). To investigate whether this shift was maintained in recipients after administration of MEXs in an allo-HSCT animal model, we further analyzed the Th1 cytokines TNF-a and Th2 cytokines IL-5 production of splenocytes from recipients 14 days after transplantation. We found that there was a significant increase in\nFrontiers in Immunology 12\nIL-5 production, but a significant decrease in TNF-a production in the mice treated with MSCs and MEXs compared with that in the control group, indicating that administeringMSCs and MEXs following allo-HSCT still resulted in a Th1 to Th2 cytokine shift.\nMoreover, we also found that, like MSCs, MEX-treated mice showed an increase in Treg cells as compared to the control group. Previous studies in allo-HSCT animal models showed that the addition of highly purified CD4+CD25+FoxP3+Treg cells resulted in a reduction of acute GVHD (43). We hereby speculate that increased Treg cells might be involved in regulating the immune response in acute GVHD mice treated with MEXs; these studies further indicate the therapeutic potential of MEXs in GVHD.\nMacrophages exhibit versatility in phenotype and function (44). The M1-like macrophages mediate pro-inflammatory effects with upregulated expression of inducible nitric oxide (iNOS), while the M2-like macrophages exert immunosuppressive effects with expression of CD206 and arginase 1 (Arg1) (45). Previous studies demonstrated that M1-like macrophage plays an important role in the pathogenesis of acute GVHD (46), and human skin lesions infiltrated by macrophage were proposed as a predictive factor for refractory GVHD associated with poor overall survival rate (47). On the contrary, M2-like macrophages can reduce the inflammatory response (48). Therefore, different subsets of macrophages play different roles in the inflammation process, while GVHD is caused by donor T cell\u2013mediated damage to recipient target organs either via cytolytic attack or release of inflammatory mediators. Ours and other studies indicated that macrophages derived from mice treated with MSCs showed high expression of the M2 marker CD206, and a reduced expression of M1 marker iNOS, indicating that MSCs can promote M2 macrophage polarization (19, 49, 50). In line with our findings, miR-216a-5p was abundant and strongly expressed in hypoxia-treated MEXs, and possibly engaged in MEX-mediated microglia to M2 polarization (51).Taken together, our data suggest that, like parent MSCs, MEXs can induce M2 macrophage polarization in vitro and in vivo. MEXs can shift macrophages to M2-like subsets, and MEXs may have a therapeutic potential for GVHD.\nMSC-EVs have been used in several preclinical studies due to their immunomodulatory properties. Seo et al. reviewed the immunomodulatory effects of MSC-EVs in animal models of GVHD, inflammatory bowel disease, sepsis, and type 1 diabetes mellitus, and found that MSC-EVs may be useful in the treatment of inflammatory diseases through direct immunosuppressive functions to alleviate the symptoms of immune disorders or to improve the xenotransplantation efficiency (52). Similarly, MSCEVs have great therapeutic potential in acute graft-versus-host disease, and as early as 2014, Kordelas et al. reported that GVHD symptoms were severely suppressed for more than 4 months after treating patients with allogeneic MSC-EV products (53). Gupta et al. conducted a review of preclinical studies of MSC-EVs for the treatment or prevention of graft-versus-host disease and showed that the use of MSC-EVs in the treatment and prevention of GVHD improved overall survival rate and GVHD clinical scores and attenuated GVHD-induced inflammatory damage (54), indicating that MSC-EVs are promising in the treatment and prevention of\nfrontiersin.org\nGVHD. In the present study, we showed that there was a lower incidence of GVHD and a higher rate of leukemia-free survival in mice receiving MSC and MEX administration. The severity of GVHD was lessened, the mice\u2019s body weight loss was decreased significantly, and the survival rate was increased in the MEXs group compared to that in the control group. Meanwhile, we also examined the antitumor response of T lymphocytes derived from recipients and found that T cells obtained from recipient mice in the MEXs group exhibited a stronger antitumor response than that in the PBS control group. Moreover, the perforin expression of effector T lymphocytes was the same as that in the PBS group and significantly higher than that of the BMCs group, while the level of granzyme expression of effector T lymphocytes was similar to that in the PBS group. Wu et al. demonstrated that miR-17-92 boosts CD8+ T lymphocyte migration to GVHD target organs but has little influence on CD8+ T lymphocyte proliferation, survival, or cytolytic capability, which might retain the benefits of MEXs on GVL (37). Taken together, our results suggest that, although specific T cell tolerance was induced, the antitumor CTL immune response was still maintained in our transplant model.\nIntravenous delivery of MSCs has gradually entered clinical trials for therapeutic and immunomodulatory use in various tissue regeneration trials. However, studies have shown that most administered MSCs are blocked by the pulmonary barrier, while MEXs avoid this disadvantage because of their small size (55). This phenomenon was also confirmed in our experiments, in which the proportion of CD4+ T lymphocytes in the lungs was lower after MEX treatment than after MSC treatment. Exosomes can be stored at \u221220\u00b0C to 37\u00b0C. However, exosomes underwent minor structural changes at the conditions of 4\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C (18), but exosomes maintained at \u221220\u00b0C were stable and did not undergo repeated freezing and thawing, making them simple to store and transport at 4\u00b0C and 37\u00b0C (18). MSCs can be cultured once to yield a significant volume of cell supernatant, and the separated exosomes, frozen and stored to guarantee uniform quality and reliable outcomes, were utilized. This avoids the labor-intensive process of culture, harvesting, and purification required for each MSC used, which increases the hazard of contamination by infectious pathogens, such as mycoplasma, viruses, endotoxins, or prions (18). Over the period of 10 generations, we discovered that MEXs produced from MSCs lost most of their immunomodulatory activity, which might be connected to the aging of their parental cells (56).\nWhile many animal disease models and clinical trials have suggested the efficacy of MSCs for the treatment of graft-versushost disease and immune system disorders, a number of clinical results disprove this (57). A randomized, placebo-controlled phase III trial evaluating MSC infusion as a steroid-refractory treatment demonstrated that the addition of MSCs produced significant improvement without additional toxicity in patients with GVHD involving visceral organs, particularly the liver and intestines, but failed to meet the primary endpoint. There may be a number of\nFrontiers in Immunology 13\nreasons for these differences, including the source of MSCs, the culture method, the dose and mode of administration, and the evaluation criteria, but the most likely reason is that different stages of the disease and changes in the in situ inflammatory state of the recipients may differentially affect the activation state of the MSC (57\u201359).\nExp l o i t i n g th e p l a s t i c i t y o f MSCs to d i ff e r en t microenvironments could optimize the therapeutic efficacy of MSCs. Mendt et al. used pro-inflammatory cytokines to me t a bo l i c a l l y r e p r o g r am MSCs t o i n c r e a s e t h e i r immunosuppressive potential and improve outcomes in a heterozygous mouse model of GVHD (60). Stimuli received by MSCs from the environment also affected EV content and their e ff ec t s on targe t ce l l s , po tent i a l l y enhanc ing the i r immunomodulatory and regenerative properties, for example, hypoxic conditions can activate and modulate signaling pathways in MSCs, enriching the EV content of specific molecules, thereby enhancing their tissue repair capacity and immunomodulatory properties (54, 61, 62).\nThe quality control of MSCs is the main challenge for its clinical application. It is difficult to perform quality control of the culture process, and the storage and transportation conditions can significantly affect the cellular efficacy, which leads to the limitation of the clinical application of MSCs (63). Due to the small size, high stability, and cell-free characteristics of MSC-EVs, they are easy to store and transport for a long period of time, which makes the application of MSC-EVs more convenient, less costly, safer, and more effective from the perspective of clinical utility (18, 64). In addition, studies have also shown that EVs secreted by different cells carry the biological characteristics of their membrane cells, which can cross the blood-brain barrier more easily than cells, and can be used for judging the efficacy of various diseases or as a drug delivery system (65, 66). Although MSC-EVs are a promising immunomodulatory therapy, there are still some challenges in the clinical application of MSC-EVs. MSC-EVs are derived fromMSCs, and every part of the MSC culture process may affect the quantity and quality of EVs, in addition, there is no recognized efficient EV isolation method and quality control. How to obtain high purity large-scale clinical application grade of MSC-EVs is still the main problem at present (52).\nIn conclusion, the data implied that MEXs had similar immunomodulatory capabilities as their parent MSCs and could exert a GVHD therapeutic impact while maintaining the GVL effect in allo-HSCT, although some of these processes are yet unclear. We need to further explore the maximum benefits of MEXs."
