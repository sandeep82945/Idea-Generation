    "abstractText": "The tautomeric properties of favipiravir were investigated experimentally for the first time by using molecular spectroscopy (UV\u2013Vis absorption, fluorescence and NMR), as well as DFT quantum\u2013chemical calculations. According to the obtained results, the enol tautomer is substantially more stable in most of the organic solvents. In the presence of water, a keto form appears to be favored due to the specific solute\u2013solvent interactions. Upon the addition of alkaline-earth-metal ions, deprotonation and complexation occurred simultaneously, giving the formation of 2 : 1 ligand : metal complexes. According to the theoretical simulations, the metal ion is captured between the carbonyl groups as a result of the size\u2013fit effect.",

            "text": "The tautomerism is a dynamic equilibrium between two or more structurally different forms with different properties of the compound in which the proton transfer occurs. This phenomenon has been considered to be very important in the drug design [1\u20135], since a large part of the active substances used in pharmacy tend to tautomerize, thus putting their biological activity and effectiveness in connection with their tautomeric state. For this reason, the possibilities for evaluating the position of the tautomeric equilibrium, along with the properties and the structure of the single tautomers, have been actively studied [6\u201312]. However, up until now, there have been no detailed experimental data about the tautomeric behavior of its various thermodynamic and kinetic effects in solution. Very precise human intervention is required to discover the appropriate conditions under which a shift of the equilibrium to the more efficient tautomeric form could be achieved. The appearance of the SARS-CoV-2 virus was crucial for our global society, causing a widespread pandemic with devastating health, social and economic challenges for the communities worldwide. This has posed a need for vital scientific breakthroughs, which include innovative approaches to developing vaccines and antiviral drugs. The Japanese anti-influenza drug favipiravir [13\u201318] has shown promising results in the treatment of the disease in China, India, Russia and other countries [19\u201325], either alone [26\u201330] or in combination [31\u201336] with other antiviral compounds. Favipiravir (1) belongs, from one side, to the 2-hydroxy pyridine family, and that is the reason why it is expected to exhibit ground-state tautomerism [37\u201343]. On the other side, it contains the structural motif of the salicylamide, which brings excited-state proton-transfer properties [44\u201348]. Up to now, the tautomeric properties of 1 and its modifications, mainly in the ground state, have been investigated theoretically under implicit solvation or in vacuum, showing a variety of theory-dependent results [49\u201355]. Therefore, the aim of this study was to conduct, for the first time, detailed experimental research concerning\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 45. https://doi.org/10.3390/ph16010045 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceuticals\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 45 2 of 13\nthe tautomerism of 1 in solution by using molecular spectroscopy (UV\u2013Vis absorption, fluorescence and NMR), as well as quantum\u2013chemical calculations.

As a result, the sufficient stabilization in the case of hydrogen bonding formation makes the 1E and 1K isomers, featuring intramolecular hydrogen bonding, most stable among the other possible isomers (see Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). Considering the data shown in Table 1, it can be clearly seen that the enol tautomer is significa tly more stable than the keto on , thus suggests that, in solution, favipiravir xists predomin in this form. As for th keto form, the v ry high relative e ergy values are an indication that it would hardly exist in solution, although the increase of the solvent polarity leads to some stabilization due to its larger dipole moment. The predicted spectral data suggest that the shift from the enol to the keto tautomer should be accompanied by a red shift in the absorption spectra and up field of the tautomeric proton in 1H NMR. The absorption spectra of favipiravir in toluene, chloroform and acetonitrile are shown in Supplementary Figure S1. As seen, the change of the solvent\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 45 3 of 13\nfrom low to high polarity does not lead to significant spectra changes (both as position and as shape), thus confirming the conclusion made above, about the presence of the enol form only in solution. The 1H NMR spectra in acetonitrile also show only an OH signal at 12.82 ppm, as is typical for a proton involved in intramolecular hydrogen bonding.\n* The absorption spectra (position of the long-wavelength band and its oscillator strength) were predicted by using the B3LYP/def2-TZVPPD//M06-2X/def2-TZVPPD level of the theory. ** The shown values correspond to S0-S2 transition; the transition S0-S1 has an oscillator strength of zero.\nAs seen from Figure 2, the addition of water to the acetonitrile solution leads to a change in the absorption spectra\u2014the intensity of the band at 320 nm decreases with increased water content. At the same time, a new broadband appears at 365 nm. It is worth noting that this process is concentration independent and cannot be attributed to formation of associates in the solvents used. Three possible processes could be expected in this case: shift of the tautomeric equilibrium towards the keto tautomer, stabilization of 1E\u201d by forming complex with water molecules and deprotonation of favipiravir.

The existence of the OH group in the enol forms gives a possibility for partial deprotonation with the addition of water. The deprotonation in acetonitrile with the addition of triethyl amine also leads to a red shift in the absorption, with appearance of a new band at 371 nm (Supplementary Figure S2 and Table S3). However, this new band has a different shape compared with the band at 365 nm from Figure 2. The second derivative spectra (shown in Supplementary Figure S3) clearly indicate this fact\u2014the band with maximum at 371 nm consists of two sub-bands. The fluorescent spectra of the products (shown in Supplementary Figures S1, S4 and S5) are also different. The theoretically simulated spectrum (Figure 3) of the deprotonated specie also suggests that it could absorb bathochromically in respect to the keto tautomer, as it is actually observed experimentally. The discussion above, in a sufficient way, proves that the spectral changes shown in Figure 2 indicate the appearance of the keto tautomer. The newly observed band at 365 nm belongs to 1K, and this is also in agreement with the theoretical predictions (Table 1 and Figure 3). Taking into account that the spectrum of the keto form is unknown, it is impossible to estimate the content of the tautomers by means of classical spectrophotometric analysis [57]. Therefore, a specially developed method for the spectral analysis of tautomeric systems, based on overlapping bands decomposition, was applied [58]. The fitting procedure yielded the individual spectra of 1E and 1K (already shown in Figure 2), as well as the estimated values of the molar fractions of the tautomers (collected in Table 2). The molar fractions allowed us to calculate the tautomeric constants and the corresponding \u2206G298K values. It is worth mentioning that these quantitative data are the first ones for the tautomerism of favipiravir that have been published up until now.\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 45 5 of 13\nTable 2.

A simple extrapolation based on the results from Table 2 predicts a \u2206G value of \u22120.1 kcal/mol in pure water, suggesting that both tautomers should be presented in almost equal quantities in aqueous solution. The whole process of water\u2013favipiravir interaction is very complex, but the tendency for the increase of water content to lead to the stabilization of the keto tautomers is obvious. According to the theoretical calculations, by using implicit solvation, the keto\u2013enol relative energy is 6.6 kcal/mol in water, which should exclude the existence of the keto form. Obviously, there is specific stabilization due to the formation of tautomer\u2013 water complexes. As an example, the complexes of both tautomers with three water molecules are shown in Figure 4. Although the enol form remains more stable in the frame of the complex, its relative stability is reduced in respect to the keto form to 2.3 kcal/mol from 6.6 as isolated molecules (see Table 1). Pharmaceuticals 2023, 16, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 14\nOn the one hand, the increase of the dielectric constant favors the stabilization of the\nmore polar K tautomer (as very well seen in Table 1), and on the other hand, the availa-\nbility of a free NH proton near the tautomeric C=O group and the amide carbonyl group,\nnot involved in hydrogen bonding, leads to the formation of the associates with the water\nmolecules and, hence, to additional stabilization. Most probably, the real situation in so-\nlution is more complex, and the sharply rising number of possible variations with increas-\ning number of water molecules makes it impossible to follow the changes by using ordi-\nnary quantum\u2013chemical calculations.\nThe emission spectra of favipiravir in the used solvents are shown in Supplementary\nFigures S2, S4 and S5. In toluene, acetonitrile and chloroform, where only the enol form is\npresented, a single weak emission at around 440 nm is observed (see Supplementary Table\nS4). The addition of water leads to a decrease in the emission band, but no new band\noriginating from the K form appears. The Stokes shift in acetonitrile (also in toluene and\nchloroform) is more than 8000 cm\u22121, which suggests an excited-state intramolecular proton\ntransfer from OH to the oxygen from the amide group. At the same time, the quantum\nyield is around and less than 1%, indicating the low efficiency of the phototautomeric\nprocess. The behavior is very similar to that of salicylamide, which exhibits excited-state\nproton transfer [44\u201348]. The theoretical calculations of 1E in the excited state confirm this\nsuggestion.

In S1, a spontaneous barrierless proton transfer occurs from the Franck\u2013 Condon state of the excited enol, giving a phototautomer, the structure of which is shown in Supplementary Figure S6. Upon relaxation to the ground state, the original 1E structure is restored through ground-state barrierless proton transfer [59]. The keto form does not possess structural changes in the excited state."

According to the stabilization energies of the complex formation (collected in Supplementary Table S6), the stabilization in the case of magnesium (II) is much larger, followed by the value of Ca2+, and this fits the experimental observations reasonably well."

            "text": "Favipiravir was purchased from Key Organics/BioNet (Cornwall, UK), had a purity of 97% and was used without further purification. The complexation was studied in acetonitrile, dried with P2O5, distilled upon CaH2 and kept under molecular sieve [60]. ARgrade LiClO4 (Fluka), NaClO4.H2O (Fluka), Mg(ClO4)2 (Fluka), Ca(ClO4)2.4H2O (Aldrich) and Ba(ClO4)2 (Fluka) were vacuum-dried at 60 \u25e6C from 3 to 5 days, depending on the case, till constant weight. Spectral measurements were performed on a Jasco V-570 UV\u2013Vis\u2013NIR spectrophotometer (Jasco Inc., Japan) that was equipped with a thermostatic cell holder (using Huber MPC-K6 thermostat (Peter Huber K\u00e4ltemaschinenbau AG, Germany) with precision 1 \u25e6C) at room temperature. The steady-state fluorescence spectra were recorded with a Jasco FP-6600 spectrofluorometer (Jasco Inc., Japan) at room temperature. For spectroscopy measurements, all solvents were of spectroscopy-grade purity. The spectral changes in water and upon addition of metal perchlorates or triethyl amine were achieved by stepwise titration of isomolar solution of 1 in acetonitrile. The obtained spectra were analyzed by a quantitative procedure based on the resolution of overlapping bands, as this yields the individual spectra of the components and their molar fractions in each solution [57,58]. The stability constants (\u03b2) were estimated according to the following stoichiometric equation: 2 L + M \u2194 C . The mass balance kept the initial concentration of the ligand constant (c0) and increased the concentration of the added metal salt (ciM): c i L + 2 x c i C = c0. Stability constant as a function of the added metal salt (ciM):\n\u03b2 = ciC( ciL )2.ciM\nwhere L is the ligand, C is the complex, M is the corresponding metal ion and c is the concentration in ith solution. The NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker Avance Neo 600 MHz spectrometer (Bruker, Germany) that was equipped with a 5 mm Prodigy probe.\nLiquid chromatography\u2013mass spectrometry analysis was carried out on a Q Exactive\u00ae\nhybrid quadrupole-Orbitrap\u00ae mass spectrometer (ThermoScientific Co., USA) that was equipped with a HESI\u00ae (heated electrospray ionisation) module, TurboFlow\u00ae UltrahighPerformance Liquid Chromatography (UHPLC) system (ThermoScientific Co., USA) and HTC PAL\u00ae autosampler (CTC Analytics, Switzerland). The chromatographic separation of the analyzed compounds was achieved on an XBridge BAH Shild RP 18 (100 \u00d7 2.1 mm, 2.5 \u00b5m) analytical column (Waters, USA), using gradient elution at 300 \u00b5L/min flow rate. The used eluents were A\u201410 mM ammonium hydrogen carbonate; and B\u2014buffer A/CAN (1/9, v/v). Full-scan mass spectra over the m/z range 100\u20131200 were acquired in positive\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 45 9 of 13\nion mode at resolution settings of 70,000. Parallel reaction monitoring (PRM) mode at resolution settings of 17,500 and 0.5 amu isolation window of precursor ions was used for quantitative analysis. The mass spectrometer operating parameters used in a negative ionization mode were spray voltage\u20144.0 kV; capillary temperature\u2014320 \u25e6C; probe heater temperature\u2014300 \u25e6C; sheath gas flow rate\u201435 units; auxiliary gas flow\u201412 units; sweep gas\u20142 units (units refer to arbitrary values set by the Q Exactive Tune software); and S-Lens RF level of 50.00. Nitrogen was used for sample nebulization and collision gas in the HCD cell. Normalized collision energy was also optimized for each derivative and was in the range between 20% and 35%. All derivatives were quantified by using 5 ppm mass tolerance filters to their theoretical calculated m/z values. Data acquisition and processing were carried out with XCalibur\u00ae version 2.4 software package (ThermoScientific Co., Waltham, MA, USA). Based on the previous theoretical results at the M06-2X/def2-TZVP level of theory [49], geometry optimization of the most stable tautomeric forms of 1 in the ground state was performed by using the same DFT method with def2-TZVPPD basis set. The M06-2X [61] refers to the range-separated hybrid density functional within the generalized gradient approximation. In our previous studies of tautomeric systems [62], it was shown that the abovementioned selected functional correctly describes the relative stability of the tautomeric forms and demonstrates a good agreement between the experimental data and theoretical results. The selected basis set def2-TZVPPD [63] includes one contracted basis function to describe inner shells and three basic functions for valence shells, as well as a set of polarization functions and one diffuse function, making it an appropriate approximation tool for quantum chemical calculations of such compounds. Bearing in mind that M06-2X systematically underestimates the absorption-band positions [64], the UV\u2013Vis spectral data were predicted by the B3LYP [65] functional, using the M06-2X optimized ground-state geometries. The NMR chemical shieldings of selected tautomeric forms of the studied compounds were calculated by using the GIAO approximation [66]. The calculated absolute shieldings were transformed to chemical shifts, using the corresponding reference compounds. The TD-DFT method was used for singlet excited-state optimizations, employing long-range corrected CAM-B3LYP functional [67] with def2-TZVPPD basis set. All calculations were performed by taking into account solvation effects via polarizable continuum model (PCM formalism) [68], considering the solvent as a dielectric medium. All structures were optimized without restrictions, using tight optimization criteria and an ultrafine grid in the computation of two-electron integrals and their derivatives. The true minima were verified by performing frequency calculations in the corresponding environment. The quantum chemical calculations were performed by using the Gaussian 16 Rev. C.01. software package [69]."

            "text": "In this study, we demonstrated that the keto\u2013enol tautomerism of favipiravir depends not so much on the dielectric constant of the solvent as on the ability of the particular tautomer to stabilize through specific interactions with the solvent. In the used organic solvents, the enol tautomer is only presented in solution, stabilized by intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The addition of water shifts the equilibrium partially to the keto tautomer, due to favored solute\u2013solvent interactions. The absorption spectrum of the pure keto form has been observed for the first time. Upon addition of alkaline-earth-metal ions, deprotonation and complexation occur simultaneously, resulting in the formation of 2:1 ligand:metal complexes in the case of Mg2+ and Ca2+. The results indicate the importance of the size\u2013fit effect.\nPharmaceuticals 2023, 16, 45 10 of 13\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ph16010045/s1.
