In this paper, the deterioration of imported pharmaceutical items is investigated as one of the challenges of the supply chain of pharmaceutical firms. Specifically, the micro, small medium enterprise (MSME), and a collaborative strategy to reduce its costs is presented. The technical solution of the cooperative strategy is the formation of a partnership alliance between the foreign patent holder of brand drugs and a domestic manufacturer through an exclusive license contract in the local country. This leads to a significant reduction of costs in the distribution network of the pharmaceutical supply chain. On the other hand, supply chain management techniques in the cooperative strategy provide the necessary motivation for its practical implementation by splitting fair profits between producers and other members, namely local government, distributors, and pharmacies.

The most important contribution of the current research is to propose an integrated framework that combines the logistics network models, valuation methods, and profit split mechanisms that embody more facts from real-world problems than separate models in this regard in previous studies. Moreover, results of the proposed strategy in the supply chain of a drug for thalassemia patients in Iran indicate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy in reducing costs and deterioration. Further, it is shown that the higher the ordering costs of the imported drugs, the lower the market share of the patent holder, and the lower the financing expenses of the cooperative alliance, the more efficient is the proposed strategy.\nKeywords Pharmaceutical MSME \u00b7 Healthcare supply chain \u00b7 Cooperative game theory \u00b7 Data science \u00b7 Pharmaceutical products \u00b7 Profit allocation \u00b7 Supply chain pricing"

            "text": "The healthcare supply chain delivery system consists of various organizations and institutions working together to ensure the efficient provision of services and products needed to maintain and improve the health of individuals in a society. The effective cooperation of these organizations in meeting pharmaceutical needs requires the formation of a supply chain and its efficient management, which is known as the pharmaceutical supply chain. A pharmaceutical supply chain (PSC) is a combination of operations, processes, and relationships between them to discover, develop and manufacture pharmaceutical products (Shah, 2004). The PSC, as one of the most crucial parts of the health system, accounts for a significant amount of health system costs. For example, in the United States, prescription drugs have been reported to form about 9.8% of all national healthcare expenditures in 2014 (Statistics, 2016).\nA PSC can include following players: Primary manufacturers, Secondary manufacturers, Distribution centers, and Retail outlets including pharmacies and hospitals. The primary manufacturers produce the active ingredients which are the chemical and molecular components of the medicine and take up a long time in quality control, changeover, and cleaning processes. Secondarymanufacturers mix excipients and active gradient composition and then produce packages, and control the quality of the medicines. Distribution companies usually have a significant role in marketing the products by obtaining necessary permissions. These companies are an integral part of the supply chain. Moreover, based on the purpose of a PSC, other players such as drug inspection laboratories (Imran et al. 2018), managed care organizations (MCO), healthcare maintenance organizations (HMO) (Shah, 2004), and other governmental or administrative bodies could be included in PSC and usually they concern with issues of quality approvals or quality control process. Moreover, Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise (MSME) in the PSC play significant roles and impacts by providing infrastructures and facilities that are responsible for the efficient production and distribution of medicines and pharmaceutical products (Shah, 2004). The pharmaceutical logistic network under study consists of the main medicine manufacturer, a local manufacturer as an MSME, some distributors and their associated pharmacies, and the government agency as the main legislator of the PSC who applies many controls on supply chain decisions.\nAs mentioned, the introduction of pharmaceutical products takes long time. According to (Shah, 2004), before a type of medicine becomes available in the market, it undergoes about 10 years of various tests including a random test of effectiveness in R&D centers. The\nmedicine is then tested for safety and efficacy. This phase involves testing the harmlessness and non-toxicity, and also the potency of the medicine to lessen the symptoms and cure the disease. This process lasts 6 to 8 years and is known as developmental activity. Therefore, for preserving the pharmaceutical manufacturers\u2019 rights and compensating for their incurred costs ($200\u2013400 Million), the patent protection mechanism is very common in the PSC (Grabowski, 1997). Under the patent terms, no one has the right to make, use or sell an inventive product in a limited and known period (life of patent) without the permission of the patent owner and in exchange for the patent charge. The medicines that go under patent protection laws are known as brand medicines or patented ones. After expiry of the patent, medicines are not under the protection of laws anymore and these medicines, which are now known as generic, can be exploited by others.\nClearly, after the patent expires, many of the rights intended for the patent holder are lost, and due to the short life of drugs, this is a serious threat to pharmaceutical companies. In addition, during the patent period, there will be threats such as the introduction of new and alternative medicines as well as the activation of the compulsory license under certain conditions andwithout the consent of the patent holder (Interested readers could refer toUrias and Ramani (2020) for more information about the compulsory license). Faced with these threats, pharmaceutical companies are always looking for strategies to benefit as much and as fast as possible from their patented products (Grabowski, 1997). One of these strategies is cooperation with local manufacturers whose local governments grant the patent holder manufacturer exclusive production and distribution rights within geographic boundaries in exchange for granting the license of the brand medicines to the local manufacturers. Such cooperation is implemented through a licensing agreement or contract, in which the patentholder is identified as the licensor and the local producer who has received the right to produce, and the required technical know-how is identified as the licensee. Notably, a noncooperative strategy in this sense is such that distributors import a certain drug of different brands and distribute it among pharmacies. As such, due to high import tariffs and other logistics problems, which will be explained later in the non-cooperative model, the ordering cost will be high, which makes the quantity of each order relatively large. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of the cooperative strategy against non-cooperative one to overcome the mentioned challenges.\nThe high costs of the health system, along with the community\u2019s sensitivity to health services, necessitate the government\u2019s active participation and control (Vogler&Martikainen, 2015). Indeed, as a public responsibility, the government bears a significant part of the healthcare system costs. These costs on the side of the PSCs are also remarkable such that they account for up to 10 percent of the total health system costs (Statistics, 2016). This is why precise and strict audits are conducted by governments to register drugs in the health network and distribute and sell them through the network of distributors and pharmacies. In fact, in many countries such as the country under study, no drug can be supplied through official channels without passing these government audits. Therefore, in addition to the high costs incurred by the government in the health system, there are opportunities for the government to influence the decisions as well as the performance of production and distribution networks through controls and audits and thereby reduce its costs (Dube, Van der Vaart, et al. 2016). Among these controls is that the government could facilitate and encourage the formation of an alliance for domestic production of licensed medicines and modify the pricing decisions in a collaborative and constructive way. In this paper, the prominent role of the government in the PSC is researched and we explain how the benefits of a collaborative strategy can be shared with the government considering its impact.\nIt should also be noted that due to the difficulty of controlling the technical know-how, the patent holder often prefers to sign a licensing agreement with one local manufacturer in the territory of a country. Also, due to government controls on drug pricing and other legislative processes as well as the granted production right of the patent holder in the local territory, there is no incentive for it to agree to non-exclusive license contracts by involving more local manufacturers. On the other hand, governments could encourage knowledge-basedmanufacturers and grant them the exclusive production right to the licensed drug to utilize domestic production benefits such as just-in-time production. They do that while providing required guarantees for banning other similar drugs and related manufacturers through regarded controls (World Health Organization, 2017). These reasons could be evidence of the fact that most international licensing agreements in developing countries, such as the country under study, are exclusive (Secretariat, 2011). These considerations also show why the proposed strategy has the capability and implementation guarantees in practice.\nTo evaluate the performance of the proposed cooperative strategy, profits and costs of involved members before and after the cooperation should be taken into account and those are remarkably affected by the pricingmechanismof the patented drug.Todescribe the pricing mechanism of the paper, some notes on the pricing mechanisms of pharmaceutical products, which have usually some differences from other products, should be considered. In recent years and inmost countries, three common pricingmechanisms are cost-based pricing, valuebased pricing, and reference-based pricing (Garattini et al., 2016). These mechanisms are less competitive and more in the control of legislators, as representatives of the governments, rather than the ones in which the price affects the requested quantities (). In cost-based pricing, the price is stipulated based on the total drugs\u2019 main costs, including manufacturing, marketing, R&D, and administrative costs. Problems, such as difficulties in transferring prices in the multinational context, made this mechanism obsolete in countries that used it, such as Italy (Garattini et al., 1994). Value-based pricing reflects the maximumwillingness of individuals for drugs. However, this mechanism is also subjected to many uncertain estimates and assumptions for pricing new drugs, which dismantled it in the Western EU as countries used this mechanismmore (Drummond& Sculpher, 2005). An efficient mechanism, which is currently used in many countries, is reference-based pricing. In this mechanism, the available drugs as well as new ones are assigned to some known classes based on their therapeutic benefits, and the prices of drugs in each class are almost the same (Schneeweiss, 2007). This price is also determined by considering the price of the class drugs in some well-known countries as the reference (Garattini et al., 2016; Schneeweiss, 2007). Moreover, innovative pharmaceutical pricing agreements, such as payback contracts (Garattini et al., 2016), setting cap as a ceiling threshold for prices (Chen et al., 2019), coverage with evidence development, financial-based risk sharing, and performance-based risk-sharing (Dunlop et al., 2018) have been examined to modify the price of drugs in many cases.\nThis paper considers the reference-based mechanism for pricing the patented drug before establishing the strategic alliance according to the cooperative strategy. This is because this mechanism is relevant for imported brand drugs in the country under study and many other countries, as mentioned. As a result, the main manufacturer had no control over the price of the patented drug in the local country before the cooperation. However, a new innovative scheme is introduced to modify the price after cooperation. This scheme is based on the idea that implementing the new strategy, namely licensing the production rights, provides a wide market share and impressive profit for the alliance formed by both licensor and licensee. Therefore, it is not far from the expectation that the local government, in response to these guarantees and the opportunities created, expects a discount in the price of the patented drug in order to reduce its costs. This adjustment in price in such a way as to provide the necessary\nmotivation for the cooperation of partners can be provided by supply chain coordination studies, such as the one employed in this paper. In this way, the contribution of members in preparing the health services is considered.\nFurther, one of the othermost challenging issues in the PSC is the deterioration of products that could be reduced by implementing the proposed cooperative strategy. In 2003, a survey in the United States showed that about $500 million is lost annually due to the deterioration of medications. In 2007, the Health Department of Chicago lost about $1 million because of the deterioration of drugs (Masoumi et al., 2012). Another audit in the same year showed that pharmaceutical companies had about $2.05 billion worth of medicines with expired dates. Issues such as incorrect prescription of drugs (Afanasjeva & Gruenberg, 2019) and problems related to drug inventory control, such as over-ordering drugs (Kumar & Kumar, 2021), have exacerbated this challenge, especially in distributors and pharmacies, which are the downstream echelons of the PSC. These pieces of evidence suggest that considering deterioration in the PSC models is of much significance (Zandkarimkhani et al., 2020). In the proposed strategy, when a health system is equipped with the domestic production of a drug under a license contract, the ordering costs along the PSC will be significantly reduced, and ordering fewer drugs will increase the service level of the PSC and decrease the number of drugs deteriorated. This is the technical aspect of the proposed strategy, which, along with optimal and integrated supply chain management, leads to improving the PSC performance.\nTaking into account the above discussion, the PSC achieves extraordinary profits and synergy using the proposed strategy. Thus, to create the necessary motivation to implement this strategy as well as strengthen and stabilize the resulting strategic alliance, these benefits should be appropriately distributed among members, and hence, a profit split problem becomes relevant. Researchers have tackled the profit allocation problem (PAP) from different viewpoints. For a less complicated problem, several game theory approaches have been enunciated, such as sequential bargaining models (Yan, 2011; Yan & Yang, 2012), cooperative games based on the Shapley value (), core concept (Marzband et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2017), and competitive games (M\u00fcller & Zaby, 2019).Moreover, for more complex problems in which the value of coalitions by different players or the value of different strategies of players could not be determined straightforwardly, other logical PAP mechanisms, such as the profit assignment in proportion to the level of effort before and after participation and from the perspective of cost or benefit have been applied (Hammami & Frein, 2014; Moon et al., 2015). In the academic research on the pharmaceutical supply chain that has been carried out, especially in recent years, the game theory approach has been dominant. In this manner, for competitive situations such as when the members\u2019 negotiation power is different or when the long-term relationship is not relevant, the non-cooperative game theory approach such as Stackelberg games have been used (Jaggi et al., 2019; Johari & Hosseini-Motlagh, 2020a, 2020b). Otherwise, coordination contracts (Hosseini-Motlagh et al., 2020a, 2020b; Huang & Wu, 2022; Tat et al., 2020) or other cooperative game theory approaches (e.g., a collaborative scheme in Tat and Heydari, 2022) have been applied. There are also studies in the context of patent valuation methods that embody the profit share of the partner in the assigned value of their intellectual properties (Moro Visconti, 2021; Sercu, 2008).\nIn the proposedmodel, valuing the branded drugs in the negotiations process, which occurs between the local manufacturer and the main manufacturer, is based on the proportional contract (Sercu, 2008), which is based on the cooperative game theory. However, since the profit of the government in the PSC could not easily be measured, and the value of coalitions for different sets of players could not be estimated, the profit distribution between the government, distributors, pharmacies, and licensee local manufacturers is carried out proportional to their afforded costs of the PSC. That is, the resulting synergy of the cooperation, i.e., the\ndifference between the profit before and after the cooperation, is divided among members relative to the percentage of costs of each member from the total costs (total costs before or after the cooperation). It is also notable that the government only pays some portion of the patients\u2019 costs as its social responsibility.\nIt should also be noted that today MSMEs play a significant role in the economic growth and gross domestic product of countries. These enterprises usually benefit from government support, such as \u201cPriority in Government tenders\u201d, \u201cSubsidy in bank lending interest\u201d, \u201cPreferential payment terms from govt and large companies\u201d, \u201cSubsidies in exhibitions participation domestic as well as international\u201d, \u201cSpecial provision under various laws\u201d (https:// thehealthmaster.com/2020/06/03/pharma-industry-appreciate-revised-msme-definition/). In the new definition of MSME on 15 June 2020, the minimum level of investment level for a company to be included in the category of MSME has been increased and this has led to an increase in the number of MSMEs eligible for government support (Nagaraj & Vaibhav, 2020). On the other hand, international alliances that are formed according to the strategy proposed in this research are often in the form of joint ventures (Simonet, 2002), and the involved firms in it, independent of their parent companies (if it is the case), unite for a specific purpose in a specific period. Therefore, considering the limited investment level of these alliances for the production of a new brand of medicine and also the mentioned government support, these alliances are well-suited for the definition of MSMEs. Indeed, such MSMEs bring many benefits to the PSC including just-in-time production (Ding, 2018), a decrease in transaction costs, a better share of R&D cost, gaining more value in the long term as a result of investing in the intellectual property, (Juneja & Amar, 2018), reduction in the deterioration costs (Bassols & Castell\u00f3, 2016), and penetrate local markets when the time to enter the market is an important success factor (Dube et al., 2016; Wu & Lai, 2019).\nThe organization of the remaining sections of the paper is as follows. The next section presents related research studies to highlight the literature gaps and the current paper\u2019s contribution to address them. Based on the Introduction and Literature Review sections, lessons learned from the literature and research objectives are highlighted. The model of the paper is introduced in Sect. 3. Section 4 illustrates the results of the model in a real case study of an Iranian MSME. The results of the model, the numerical case study, research, and managerial implications are presented in Sect. 5. Finally, the conclusion of the paper and future research opportunities is discussed in Sect. 6."

            "text": "Inter-firm cooperation has attracted the attention of many studies because it can be regarded as a strategy to respond to the growing nature of complexity, uncertainty, and competitiveness in the business environment (Bouncken et al., 2015). This also leads to risk sharing, reduction\nin R&D costs, and shortening product life cycles (Alves et al., 2016). Other advantages of cooperation are technology acceptance, improvement in the distribution channels, obtaining synergies (Devece et al., 2019), agility, and flexibility (Janatyan et al., 2021; Prak et al., 2015), obtaining essential knowledge, sharing resources (Bengtsson & Kock, 2014), economies of scale and scope (Gnyawali & Park, 2011), and penetrating new markets (Gnyawali and Park, 2009).\nDue to the high costs of new drug development projects, existing financial resources are not sufficient. However, the integration and coordination of members could decrease costs, create advantages, and facilitate the implementation of projects (Cummings et al., 2018). The problem of the partnership between two categories of pharmacies, namely \"mail-order pharmacy\" and \"Chain Pharmacy,\"was studied by Iacocca andMahar (2019). In that research, mail-order pharmacies assigned some of their orders to themost appropriate Chain Pharmacy in the partnership strategy. Also, it was shown that drug prices, reimbursement contracts, and profit/incomedistribution policies influence partnership decisions.Among the future research interests mentioned in Ding (2018) for Pharma Industry 4.0 development are: \u201cimproving the effectiveness of coordination and communication across different entities\u201d and \u201cReducing waste and pollution at different stages.\u201d Analytical and quantitative valuing of the perceived benefits of the cooperation of partners in PSC is one of the motivations and innovations of the present research, which has received less attention in previous papers.\nArana et al. (2020) list the challenges of a two-echelon supplier-customer pharmaceutical supply chain as non-compliance with delivery times leading to low levels of service. Also, long lead time for imports and lack of inventory management strategies have been identified as factors reducing the service level. The challenges raised in that article, delivery problems caused by imports, are one of the motivations of the present study, which can be alleviated using the proposed cooperative strategy.\nDespite notable results stemming from cooperation and integration-focused studies, few researchers have paid attention to innovative strategies that provide benefits due to supply chain management practices. For example, the investment in preservation technology is among the innovative strategies proposed byYadav et al. (2021). They explained that investing in preservation technologies reduces the deterioration of products by up to 20%. Domestic production under a license agreement is also an innovative supply chain strategy that goes beyond just integrated decision-making, with the controlled transfer of technical knowledge to another country. This strategy, which can even lead to the improvement of the existing technology level (Alletto et al., 2017), has been used in many countries. Nevertheless, the present research is one of the first studies that evaluate it in terms of the mentioned benefits and provides a framework for its practical and directed implementation of it."

            "heading": "2.2 The game theory in PSC",
            "text": "The game theory approach has been used with different viewpoints in the field of PSC problems. This approach usually addressed the strategic decisions of PSC in two states of cooperation and competition. For the conflict between governments and pharmaceutical companies about highprices of drugs,Xu andZhu (2021) have suggested that governments impose taxes at variable rates. If these rates are set correctly, they could both compensate for parts of the government\u2019s expenses and satisfy customers by encouraging pharmaceutical companies to do more research and development and, as a result, bring sufficient profitability. This problem was modeled as a Stackelberg game where, in the first level, the government determines the tax rate, and in the second level, pharmaceutical companies determine their prices in such\na way that the goals of each are maximized. The problem of collaborative or competitive cooperation between a leading enterprise for patent technology and some manufacturers for investing in a patent technology was scrutinized in Qiu (2022). They showed that the level of cooperation of each member is not only affected by the feasibility of innovative technology but in the case of cooperation, their willingness to invest and the resulting output is higher. A closed-loop PSC consisting of one manufacturer and two retailers who compete on corporate social responsibility (CSR) efforts to boost the collection of pharmaceutical returned components was analyzed by Hosseini-Motlagh et al., (2020a, 2020b). These members decided in a decentralized style according to a Stackelberg game in which, the manufacturer determined his green effort level for enhancing demand at the first level, and the retailers decided on their CSR efforts secondly. However, they all decided together in a centralized style and used the Nash Bargaining solution to divide the synergy of the cooperation between themselves. The use of game theory has even been extended to competitive issues between PSCs as Shakouhi et al. (2021) evaluated the competition between two supply chains in terms of price, quality, location, and level of advertising using Nash and Stackelberg games. McAdams et al. (2020) suggested game theory as a valid tool to predict the behaviors of key players in the global vaccination of the COVID-19 pandemic. To this end, global health institutions influencing the global vaccination could evaluate different scenarios of self-financing governments as well as self-interest manufacturers using a game theory analysis and apply decisions that improve the global supply of vaccines.\nThe reviewed pharmaceutical supply chain research clearly shows that game theory is a suitable approach for evaluating strategic decisions and collaborative alliance issues. When there is a conflict of interests (e.g., McAdams et al., 2020; Xu & Zhu, 2021), the competitive game theory could assess the best control decisions by legislators that can lead to social welfare. On the other hand, when long-term cooperation and fair distribution of participation earnings based on trust are considered, cooperative games (Hosseini-Motlagh et al., 2020a, 2020b) provide a suitable solution. The problem of valuing the know-how of the patent holder in the partnership with the domestic manufacturer in the present paper is also according to a cooperative game theory-based valuation mechanism (Sercu, 2008). To the best of our knowledge, this mechanism has not yet been applied to the valuation of pharmaceutical products in academic research."

            "heading": "2.3 The pricing issues in PSC",
            "text": "Many studies in the context of coordination contracts and pricing models for products consider the price of drugs as a decision variable and introduce the demand as a function of the price. However, in many countries, the price is controlled by legislatures, and in these cases, the price of medicines cannot easily be controlled for objectives, such as demand stimulation. Therefore, studies that treat drugs as other products and consider a fully competitive market for drugs, such as Chen et al. (2019) and Johari and Hosseini-Motlagh (2020a, 2020b), could not be extended to the pharmaceutical supply chains in many countries. However, the assumption about the reference-based pricing mechanism of the paper could be modified reasonably; for instance, just with the involvement of legislative bodies makes the proposed framework more realistic for the application in most countries in the world that use this pricing mechanism (Rida et al., 2019). This scheme is an innovative pricing mechanism in context with reference-based pricing aimed at motivating members to engage in the proposed cooperative strategy. This approach is an innovation for pharmaceutical supply chain coordination research."

Rastogi and Singh (2019a) study the inventory control of perishable pharmaceuticals to determine the optimal ordering quantity and the optimal time interval. A similar problem was investigated by Rastogi and Singh (2019b) who additionally examined the effects of learning parameters on the inventory system. These studies confirmed assumptions used in the proposed model of the paper about deterioration and its effects on the costs of inventory systems in distributors and pharmacies.\nAlthough cooperative strategies for reducing the deterioration of drugs in the PSC are a significant challenge, it has been addressed in a few studies. Studies conducted by Chung and Kwon (2016), Moslemi et al. (2017), and Taleizadeh et al. (2020) mainly focused on the logistic capabilities of PSC and attempted to optimize the supply chain operations by considering communications between PSCmembers. In this regard, the integration of manufacturers, distributors, and pharmacies in a distribution network of pharmaceutical products with the decisions about the location of facilities, routing of vehicles, and management of inventories has been evaluated in Zandkarimkhani et al. (2020). The cooperation of members in a pharmaceutical supply chain to manage the deterioration of products and reduce their destructive effects was studied by Sazvar et al. (2021). In that paper, three flows of reconstruction, recycling, and destruction were considered for expired drugs, while the effectiveness of the strategy in reducing costs and environmental effects was confirmed in numerical results. Again, the proposed strategy of the current paper has a benefit over the mentioned research that suggests a technical solution for reducing the deterioration of drugs, namely a semijust-in-time production system as the result of domestic manufacturing of drugs instead of importing them."

            "text": "Bearing in mind the explanations in the Introduction and Literature Review sections, several threats and challenges occurred in the supply of pharmaceutical products, particularly new\nones. First, despite incurring significant costs and long R & D time, subsequent administrative and audit procedures, manufacturers face the threat of the introduction of alternative drugs, compulsory licenses, and technological know-how leakage. Under these circumstances, manufacturers can not only reimburse their costs in a shorter time by becoming more systematically committed to the license contracts and gaining exclusive production rights in different countries with the cooperation of eligible partners. The strategy also leverages the service level of the pharmaceutical supply chain by enabling a near-just-in-time production system and reducing the cost of patients. In this regard, it may be recalled that price, availability, and affordability are the three basic elements that affect the quality of pharmaceutical services (Rida et al., 2019). Hence, the first research objective of the paper is described as follows:\nObjective 1: To formulate the profit split problem, such that not only the profitability of the main manufacturers in the specified time ensured, but they are also protected against external threats.\nAmong other benefits of the strategy, the reduction of government costs as a result of the discounts obtained from granting the exclusive production right to the cooperative alliance wasmentioned.This entails that the benefits of cooperation are distributed among allmembers fairly. Hence, the second research objective of the paper is as follows:\nObjective 2: To model the fair distribution of benefits among members to offset their costs and provide incentives for a long-term partnership. Benefits distributed to the government, which will be spent on the treatment costs of patients, can be an example of social responsibility that is addressed in this paper.\nTo address the first two research objectives, a game theory approach is used to formulate and set the license contract betweenmanufacturers in a fair manner and according to international alliances (Sercu, 2008). The profit split between the government, distributors, pharmacies as well as the alliance of the manufacturers will also be proportional to their afforded costs. This method, which seems to be fair, is very efficient and widely used in many large strategic alliances for which other methods such as game theory could not be applied easily due to the lack of estimation of some parameters.\nAnother declared major challenge in the pharmaceutical supply chain is the high rate of deterioration of drugs and its resulting costs which have been repeatedly confirmed by international reports. In health systems, for reasons such as the need for high service levels, few suppliers, and sometimes high ordering costs (especially for imported drugs), large amounts of drugs are ordered and stored in PSC echelons. This in turn leads to high deterioration rates of drugs. Accordingly, the third research objective of the paper is as follows:\nObjective 3: To propose an efficient way to respond to the deterioration of drugs as one of the main challenges of PSC.\nAs stated, the domestic production of drugs in the proposed strategy provides significant savings in the deterioration costs. The effect of this could be appraised using inventory control models. In addition to reducing costs, other benefits such as reductions in toxins that enter due to the disposal of decaying drugs could be counted as valid investigations for future research.\nReaching these goals also needs a proper evaluation of the know-how provided by primary manufacturers. Although, the latter is very common in trade agreements and strategic alliance decisions, it has received less attention in academic research (Hong&Chan, 2014). The paper\nhas also innovation in valuing know-how because the proposed method utilizes existing methods while taking into account the pricing and profit distribution decisions."

In the paper\u2019s case study, we evaluate the pricing mechanism and determine the marginal profit of PSC members according to a predetermined mechanism by the government.\nAs mentioned in the literature review, deterioration is one of the main challenges of PSC, which imposes high costs every year. Local production through a license contract is introduced as a cooperative strategy that could have significant effects on the reduction of deterioration costs. As shown in the results, this strategy, alongside a proper managerial policy, will improve the efficiency of PSC. Moreover, the government has a determinant role in the PSC and its decisions about controlling, auditing other members, and pricing decisions that impact the PSC\u2019s performance. In the cooperative strategy, it is presumed that if the local manufacturer obtains the production license from the main manufacturer, the government will protect it by banning the other brand\u2019s imports. Instead, the government will expect discounts from the manufacturer to decrease its incurred costs.\nIt is shown that the cooperative strategy improves the efficiency of the supply chain. However, the resulting profit due to cooperation in the PSC should be split between members in an acceptable way, considering the effort of members to reduce costs. In this paper, two profit-sharing mechanisms are used. In valuing the license of the main manufacturer, a proportional contract based on the cooperative game theory is proposed. Second, for splitting the profit between the local manufacturer, distributors, pharmacies, and the government, a profit-sharing mechanism is used, which is proportional to the cost incurred by members. The second mechanism is due to the impracticality of applying the game theory concepts in the calculation of values in different coalitions.\nIn the supply chain under consideration, three groups of players have a critical role in preparing the patients\u2019 drug requirements. The first group comprises distributors and pharmacies, which have the closest relationship with patients. The costs incurred by this group include the purchasing cost, the ordering cost, the holding cost, and the deterioration cost. The cooperative strategy decreases the costs of this group, especially those related to ordering and deterioration. The manufacturers form the second group of players. In the non-cooperative strategy, the production is carried out by the main manufacturer. In contrast, the production under the license of the main manufacturer by the local manufacturer is followed in the cooperative strategy which yields a reduction in production and distribution costs. The third\ngroup is the government as themain legislator in the PSC andHDS. Among the government\u2019s responsibilities in this system is the issuance of operating permissions in the system and the control of prices and profit margins of PSC members. In the negotiation process between the government and other PSC members, the government requests discounts in the supply price and profit margins to decrease costs.\nThe benefits of cooperative strategy could be enumerated as the exclusive market for supporting the local manufacturer by the government, a decrease in the ordering, transaction, and deterioration costs, and better management and control of the PSC. Hence, to describe these advantages, the processes and operations of members are described individually. In addition, the profit allocation in the cooperative strategy is presented.\nThe notations of the model throughout the paper are as follows:\nNotation Description\nN The index of all members in the supply chain {n \u2208 N} J The index of distributors { j \u2208 D, D \u2282 N} r The index of pharmacies {r \u2208 P, P \u2282 N} s The index of supply chain strategies {c cooperative strategy; nc\nnon-cooperative strategy}\nM The index of manufacturer (m mm for main manufacturers; m lm for local manufacturers)\njr The index referring to the coalition of a distributor with its pharmacies\nG The index for denoting the government\nRj The set of all pharmacies related to distributor d TCsn The cost function of member n in strategys TCsjr The total cost function of distributor j and its pharmacies in strategy s TCo,sn The ordering cost function of member n in strategys TCH , sn The holding cost function of member n in strategys TCD, sn The deterioration cost function of member n in strategys nsj The number of deliveries from the distributor j to each of its pharmacies during the replenishment cycle time of distributor in strategy s\nQk,sj The order quantity of distributor j at the beginning ofk\u2019th demand cycle in strategys\nqsr The order quantity of pharmacy r in strategy s tsn The replenishment cycle time of pharmacies of member n in strategy s\nIn(t) The inventory level of member n at time t\nDr The cumulative annual demand rate of pharmacy\n\u03b8n(t) The deterioration rate of member n Csn The ordering cost of member n per order in strategy s\nhn The holding cost of member n per unit, per unit time\nNotation Description\nkn The deterioration cost of member n per unit, per unit time\n\u03b1n, \u03b2n, wn The coefficients of deterioration function of member n\nps The price of medicine in strategy s\ncm The production cost of manufacturer m per unit DPsm The annual depreciation cost of manufacturer m in strategy s\nR The royalty rate in the license contract\nROCm The return on capital rate of manufacturer m in its own business\nQs The total order quantities of distributors in strategy s\nMs The market share of main manufacturer in the non-cooperative strategy\ndss The profit margin of distributors in strategy s\npss The profit margin of pharmacies in strategy s\nAs The total profit margin of distributors and pharmacies in strategy s\nX The percentage of patients\u2019 cost subsidized by the government\nPn The cooperative gain of member n W sn The cost function of member n in strategy s \u03c0 sn The profit function of member n in strategy s"

            "text": "It is assumed that several distributors in the PSC use the distributor inventory management policy. The distributors apply fixed replenishment cycle times for all of their assigned pharmacies. Thus, for each distributor, one pharmacy is regarded whose demand is the cumulative demand of all pharmacies assigned to it. In fact, holding and ordering costs are fixed for all pharmacies of distributors. This simplification is considered because the model aims to determine the government\u2019s policy for a special drug at the macro level, and considering all details of the problem makes the analysis at the macro level almost impossible.\nThe assumptions for the distributor-pharmacy model are as follows:\n(1) The annual demand rate is fixed. This assumption is valid when the community of patients and their daily consumption of specific prescription drugs are known. This assumption is supported by the real case study of Iran. Indeed, the drug under study is an effective drug for specific patients (with their daily consumption known and published in official statistics). Slight fluctuations in drug demand can also be ignored. Although the deterioration of these drugs is inevitable, it is influenced by inventory system policies such as order quantity, which in turn depends on model parameters, such as ordering cost. (2) The deterioration rate is time-dependent and changes over time. This assumption makes the model applicable to many deteriorating products because as the holding time of drugs increases, the percentage of deteriorated drugs increases. This assumption and\nthe type of model utilized have been claimed to be more significant and logical than a constant rate in healthcare systems (Kumar & Kumar, 2021). 3) The distributors are responsible for determining the policy of the distributors-pharmacies model. This policy is also common for many pharmaceutical products because the distributors are responsible for the deterioration of items, whereby a higher level of control is considered for them as compensation for the deterioration costs. (4) The order quantity of the distributors is a multiple of their pharmacies\u2019 order quantity. This assumption also makes possible the extraction of the optimal policies of the distributors-pharmacies model. Moreover, the periodic review inventory system of distributors has found many applications in real-world problems (Park et al., 2014; Taleizadeh et al., 2017). (5) After forming a strategic alliance, the demand of patients will be answered by domestically produced drugs. It should be noted that this control, which the government applies, can only be applied in the official channels of the health network, such as certified pharmacies. The demand that is provided outside the official channels, such as the black market, is outside the scope of the present research.\nIt should also be noted that the analytical model of the distributors-pharmacies has been adopted by Wang et al. (2011) because their model introduces the time-dependent deterioration rate, which is suitable for evaluating different drugs with different deterioration rates. Hence, the objective functions and the solution approach of that model are represented without paying attention to the details (see Wang et al., 2011 for more details).\nTo consider the time-dependent deterioration rate for distributors and pharmacies, the deterioration function is considered as Eq. (1) (Wang et al., 2011). The assumption about the variability of the deterioration rate over time is consistent with research addressed by the inventory policies of pharmaceutical products (Wang et al., 2011).\n\u03b8n(t) \u03b1n + \u03b2n .wn .twn\u22121 n \u2208 D \u222a R (1) According to the case study of the research, distributors are responsible for all deterioration costs of pharmacies.

It is almost impossible to check all pharmacies in detail and determine their optimal policy. Hence, a simple hypothesis used in model development is that the replenishment cycle time of all pharmacies belonging to a distributor is equal. Also, in the case study, the sum of the demands of pharmacies served by a distributor is used as the demand of the representative pharmacy of that distributor. This hypothesis is intended to make the model simple and practical, but researchers such as Nematollahi et al. (2018) support this hypothesis by considering a fixed visit interval for the distributor of a set of pharmacies. Moreover, the vendor-managed inventory system or distributor-managed inventory system is the strategy that gives the responsibility of determining the optimal policies of two-echelon inventory systems to the vendor. This strategy has wide applications in pharmaceutical supply chains, and authors, such as Tsui et al. (2008), Krichanchai and MacCarthy (2017), and Hossain and Parvez (2020), have applied and assessed it.\nIn the above equations, the cost functions of the distributors have been introduced as a function of Csj . This is because the ordering costs of distributors are different in cooperation and non-cooperation strategies, and it is expected that by reducing this parameter in the cooperation strategy, the supply chain costs will decrease remarkably. Moreover, when the value of nsj and t s r is determined by optimizing T C s jr in Eq. (2), order quantities of pharmacies and distributors will be specified by Eqs. (11) and (12), respectively (Wang et al., 2011). Due to the discrete nature ofnsj , the convexity ofT C s jr inEq. (2) is not confirmed.However, for fixed values of nsj the convexity of T C s jr is proved (Wang et al., 2011). Therefore, in a modified iterative algorithm as the following, the near-optimal values of t sr , and n s j can be determined (Wang et al., 2011):"

            "text": "Given that in the production of medicine, technical knowledge is an essential component of production, a valuation process is needed to determine the value of the technical knowledge of themainmanufacturer. In this paper, a license contract based on the royalty rate is investigated for issuing the technical knowledge of production. The contract saves a percentage of total sales as the royalty rate (Vogler & Martikainen, 2015) for the main manufacturer and is the most common form of the license agreements in the pharmaceutical industry.\nTo identify r, the proportional contract of Sercu (2008) is utilized. Parameters for this contract are determined such that the excess profit of cooperation, compared to the noncooperation style, is split between two partners equally. In other words, if the profits of the main and local manufacturers after cooperation are denoted by \u03c0cmm and \u03c0 c lm , respectively, and those of non-cooperation are stated by \u03c0ncmm and \u03c0 nc lm , then the profit of cooperation is split between the main and local manufacturer based on Eq. (14):\n\u03c0cmm \u2212 \u03c0clm \u03c0ncmm \u2212 \u03c0nclm (14) To determine \u03c0clm , it is assumed that based on the agreements between the main and local manufacturer as well as the local government, the market structure after issuing the license contract will be exclusive, and not under control by the government. Now, denoting the order quantity of distributer j and its pharmacies in the case of cooperation by Q1,cj and qcr | r \u2208 R j , the cumulative order quantities of distributor Qc will be equal to Qc \u2211\nj (Q1,cj + \u2211 r\u2208R j qcr )/t c j . Also, regarding the notations of the paper, the profits of main and\nlocal manufacturers in the cooperative strategy will be as Eqs. (15) and (16):\n\u03c0cmm r . pc. Qc (15)\n\u03c0clm (pc \u2212 clm). Qc \u2212 D Pclm \u2212 r .pc. Qc (16) Equation (15) expresses the license income of the main manufacturer while Eq. (16) represents the local manufacturer\u2019s profit, which is the sales income minus the production cost, depreciation cost, and the license cost paid to the main manufacturer.\nOn the other hand, in the non-cooperative strategy, the local manufacturer has no share in the market of the considered drug. Therefore, its profit should only be calculated based on the profitability of that firm on its own business. Thus, the presumed profit of the local manufacturer for investing D Plm in its own business (instead of the established firm in the cooperative strategy) considering its return on the capital rate (ROC) is as Eq. (17). This rate for a firm is the after-tax net profit divided by its assets. The ROC is an appropriate rate for calculating the profit of the local manufacturer outside the cooperative alliance. This is because the rate could be extracted from the accounting statements of firms and used to compare the performance of firms with the outside environment instead of internal goals. This assumption is also supported by Juneja and Amar (2018) in explaining how firms could transform their income into capital.\n\u03c0nclm ROClm . D Pclm (17) Considering that the main manufacturer only provides its technical knowledge and does not invest in the new manufacturing firm, its profit before the cooperation will be equal to zero if it has no market share in the local country. However, if its share in the local market before forming the alliance is denoted by s, its profit before the cooperation is the net sales income determined according to Eqs.

(28) is satisfied:\nPG W cG\nPlm W clm\nPjr W cjr\n(28)\nTo derive the necessary and sufficient conditions for the cost-effectiveness of the considered strategy, two conditions should be considered. Also, in order to explain these conditions, two prices, namely p1 and p2 are introduced, p1 is the price that makes the profit of the local manufacturer before and after the cooperative strategy equal to zero, i.e., for p1, the relation \u03c0clm(p1) \u2212 \u03c0nclm 0 is true. On the other hand, p2 is defined as the price that establishes the relation \u03c0cdr (Ac, p2, C c j , t c r , n c j , Q 1,c j ) \u2212 \u03c0ncdr (Anc, pnc, Cncj , tncj , nncj , Q1,ncj ) 0. Now, if pnc \u2265 p1 in the first condition, then the strategy is more cost-effective in the current setting, and the profit allocation mechanism preserves the previous profit of members and just assigns some additional profit to members, based on a logical proportion. However, if pnc < p1 but p2 > p1, as in the second condition, then by setting the new price as p such that p1 \u2264 p \u2264 p2, the profitability of the supply chain in the cooperative strategy based on the proposed profit distribution mechanism is still ensured. The advantage of the strategy will be in terms of reducing distribution costs. Out of these conditions, the strategy is not cost-effective.\nThus,\nTheorem 1 The necessary and sufficient condition for the cost-effectiveness of the studied strategy is that either pnc \u2265 p1 or pnc < p1 and p2 > p1.\nThe new price pc and profit margin Ac is set by solving Eq. (28). On the other hand, due to the fact that the government is the legislator of the supply chain, it could either apply all the changes in the profit margin for the distributors or set new dsc and psc using the profit allocation mechanism based on the costs of distributors and pharmacies. To do so, the profit and cost functions of pharmacies and distributors are introduced as Eqs. (29) \u2013 (32), respectively:\n(29)\n\u03c0 sr (ps, As, dss, pss, t s r ) \u2211 j \u2211 r\u2208R j Dr .(1 + dss).(1 + pss). ps\n\u2212 \u2211\nj \u2211 r\u2208R j qsr t sr .(1 + dss).ps \u2212 \u2211 j T Csr (t s r )\nW sr (ps , dss, t s r ) \u2211 j \u2211 r\u2208R j qsr t sr .(1 + dss).ps + \u2211 j T Csr (t s r ) (30)\n\u03c0 sj (ps , As, C s j , dss, n s j , t s r , Qs) \u2211 j \u2211 r\u2208R j qsr t sr .(1 + dss).ps \u2212 \u2211 j T Csj ( Csj , t s r , n s j ) \u2212 ps .Qs\n(31)\nW sj (ps, C s j , n s j , t s r , Qs) \u2211 j T Csj ( Csj , t s r , n s j ) + ps .Qs (32)\nThen, the cooperative gain of distributors and pharmacies is obtained using Eqs.

This paper is related to producing a licensed drug for treating thalassemia patients in Iran. Thalassemia is a malignant disease with symptoms such as a low level of alpha and beta proteins in red blood cells. As the main component of red blood cells, Hemoglobin is responsible for carrying oxygen throughout the body and producing alpha and beta proteins. The functionality of hemoglobin is disrupted in thalassemia patients, and the proteins are not sufficient in the blood cells of patients. Thalassemia patients are classified based on the deficiency and severity of the proteins in their blood. Unfortunately, thalassemia is not fully curable, and current drugs only decline the progression and worsening of the disease. The best-known treatment for thalassemia is blood transfusion, which has undesirable consequences and side effects, such as transfusion-induced iron overload in the patient\u2019s body; the reason is that there is no way to remove iron from the body. Jadenu\u00ae (deferasirox) is one of the newly developed drugs for this disease produced under the license of Novartis. The better performance of Jadenu\u00ae than other available drugs has been confirmed by strict and rigorous quality control and stability tests, for example, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) standards. Therefore, Iran\u2019s FDA has granted exclusive production rights to the local manufacturer under the license of Novartis.\nFor thalassemia, the percentage of costs incurred by the government in Iran is 85% (x 0.85). Before the domestic production of Jadenu\u00ae, the market share of the drug in Iran was about 5% (s 0.05). However, the entire market shares of the brand, as well as the import prevention of other brands, were ensured by the government, providing the under-license domestic production of the drug. The current profit margin of distributors for the imported drugs of Jadenu\u00ae is 7% (dsnc 0.07), while that of the pharmacies is 18% (psnc 0.18). The drug is supplied in 90, 180, and 360 mg tablets, and the drug requirement of the patients varies from 7 to 28 mg per kilogram of the patient\u2019s weight. There are four main distributors for the drugs, and the total demand for their pharmacies is estimated to be 1500 kg per year. The values of parameters for the considered case study are summarized in Table 1.\nAs shown in Table 1, the production cost is specified by the transaction cost of manufacturers per each supplied drug. Therefore, the lower cost of domestic production is due to the lower cost of transactions. Also, the cost of depreciation in domestic production is much higher, because, in this case, the production capacity must meet the total market demand.\nAnother note about data is that the deterioration rate parameters indicate that as the shelf life of drugs increases, so does their rate of deterioration.\nIt should be pointed out that the data used in the research stemmed from various sources. Some of the data are the instructions of legislative institutions such as the Food and Drug Organization, which have been communicated to all companies active in the studied health system. Among the data used in the current research are the profit margins allowed by distributors and pharmacies for every kind of drugs. Various other data have been extracted from the annual reports of the government, including the number of Thalassemia patients and their annual doses.\nOther data can be directly extracted from the documents of studied firms or estimated from their documents. For example, due to the deployment of advanced inventory control systems in pharmacies and distributors, information related to ordering and holding costs is available. Also, the information related to the rate of deterioration can be extracted by referring to periodic reports of inventory systems by comparing healthy and deteriorated drugs. However, it should be noted that due to the sensitivity of results of the model and the proposed strategy to these data, for example, the return on the capital rate of firms based on their accounting statements, these sources must be reliable and agreed upon by the parties, because otherwise, results obtained in reality can be significantly different from results obtained from the models."

Using the introduced iterative algorithm in Sect. 4.2, the optimal policies of each distributor and pharmacy are determined (Table 2). As depicted in Table 2, the deterioration quantity in PSC is 1513630\u20131,500,000 13,630 gr, which is a significant percentage of the total supplied quantity.On the other hand, regarding the value of parameters in the cooperative strategy, the inventory policy of the distributor-pharmacy model is expressed according to Table 3.\nIn the cooperative strategy, the deterioration quantity is 1503254\u2013150,000 3254 gr. The results of Table 4 clearly show that the cooperative strategy decreases the deterioration quantity as well as the inventory costs. Based on the cooperative strategy, the deterioration has been reduced bymore than 76 percent. This result is striking and valuable in the context of\nPSC. For example, as expressed in the Literature Review, the preservation technology could decrease the deterioration by just up to 20%. Based on this result, one of the main goals in supporting domestic production under license agreements can be considered a significant reduction in the deterioration of drugs. Accordingly, health system managers should take necessary protections to facilitate the implementation of this strategy and can use models presented in this paper to measure and evaluate the outcomes of the strategy. Other variables of the model have been summarized in Table 4.\nBased on the results that pnc > p1, and therefore based on Theorem 1, the necessary and sufficient condition for the cost-effectiveness of the cooperative strategy exists. Also, the royalty rate of 0.2 is a common choice in licensing pharmaceutical products (Zaharoff, 2004) and is very close to the thumbnail rule of a 25% royalty rate."

Therefore,wefirst examine the effects of this parameter on the deterioration cost and supply chain cost and then show how the variation of parameters affects the profitability of members in the PSC.\nThe total deterioration cost of the supply chain versus the ordering cost of the distributors has been depicted in Fig. 2. The figure clearly shows that any progress in reducing ordering costs decreases the supply chain\u2019s deterioration cost. Therefore, forming an alliance between\nlocal and main manufacturers is an innovation that empowers the supply chain against the high deterioration cost.\nAs observed, changes in the ordering cost affect the deterioration quantity and cost. These lead to a change in the cooperative price and the cooperative gain of partners. In Table 5, the results of the cooperative strategy against the ordering cost of distributors in the noncooperative strategy are presented. The results indicate that the higher the ordering costs of distributors, the greater the cooperative profitability of PSC members. The results also indicate that as the ordering cost increases, the profit margin decreases further, resulting in lower patient and government costs."

Thus, the considered drugs\ncould be regarded in the category of thalassemia improvement drugs, and the investigation of the market share of drugs before forming the domestic licensee production could provide managerial insight into a selection of available drugs in the cooperative strategy. However, it should be noted that the investigation here is just on the economic consideration of the brand, and the therapeutic benefits of one drug over other drugs may impair the assumption that drugs are homogeneous in one group.\nIn Fig. 3, the cooperative profit of the local manufacturer versus the market share of the main manufacturer is shown.\nAlso, Table 6 displays the results of the cooperative strategy for different market shares of the main manufacturer.\nThe results of Table 6 and Fig. 4 are noteworthy in the sense that, by relying on them, the value of the license could be interpreted. In this manner, the larger the market share of the main manufacturer, the higher the value of its production license, and this, in turn, reduces the profitability of the local manufacturer and other domestic members of the PSC. As the market share of themainmanufacturer in the localmarket increases, the cooperative pricewill be higher, the profit margins of distributors and pharmacies will be lower, and government spending will be higher. With these results in mind, choosing a main manufacturer with a smaller market share would be a more efficient choice from the viewpoint of the government and other members. However, this conclusion is apart from the effectiveness of the drug in terms of health improvement of patients and is only a cost\u2013benefit analysis. This conclusion also is supported by other research, such as Lauton et al. (2019), which showed that generic suppliers in PSC are not always the best choice for reducing costs and risks."

            "text": "The paper\u2019s research implications and managerial insights are retrieved from the model itself and its results. The proposed model examined the effectiveness of a strategic alliance and the benefits it provides for the pharmaceutical supply chains. It clearly focused on the deterioration of pharmaceutical products as an important challenge of PSC. Meanwhile, the formation of alliances by domestic production of patented drugs is shown to alleviate this challenge. In this regard, the strategy\u2019s main effect is to decrease distributors\u2019 ordering cost significantly because there is no need to import drugs anymore. This, in turn, reduces the deterioration amounts as the results indicated. Moreover, alongside the strategy\u2019s advantages in reducing PSC costs, the mechanism considers some portion of the generated surplus profit for the government due to its direct influence on granting the exclusive production right to the patented drug. Therefore, the considered strategy not only benefits the direct members of PSC but also provides utilities for patients because of decreasing the cost and reducing the exorbitant cost of the government in the health care system. This conclusion suggests that the government advocates the cooperative strategy of the paper and facilitates the formation of the strategic alliance.\nAs explained, facilitating international cooperation of manufacturers through licensing agreements can be one of the most effective ways to reduce the deterioration of pharmaceutical products as one of the main challenges in this field. This strategy, alongside the supply chain management practice, could lead to outcomes such as significant cost savings and the reduction of deterioration. These can be greater than conventional solutions, such as preservation technologies, which require a significant investment. Given the theoretical foundations of research, the reason for this would be obvious: reducing the length of ordering periods of imported drugs, as some research has recommended, the long period of importing drugs as an indicator of the low level of service of the supply chain. On the other hand, the present study provides managers with a systematic approach to evaluate the strategy, such as a theoretical framework for supporting price modification as an innovative scheme in the reference-based pricing mechanism and the fair distribution of profits among members. So, managers could rely on the framework of the paper to provide the necessary motivation and coordination between members in addition to their own positive and supportive view of the strategy that will lead stockholders to support the strategy.\nOther insights are stemming from the numerical results and sensitivity analysis. The first insight of the numerical results is about the outstanding role of the ordering cost in the deterioration-related costs, as discussed earlier. Moreover, the market shares of the main manufacturer before establishing a cooperative strategy are regarded as another determinant parameter of the model. The investigation showed that a higher market share for the main manufacturer leads to a higher valuation for licenses and production rights,which sequentially increases the cooperative price and reduces the profitability of members in the cooperative strategy. If there are several options for external participation, the less-known manufacturers are better options than well-known manufacturers, although the risk of working with these manufacturers is higher. Local manufacturers investigated a similar analysis. In this regard, it was observed that local manufacturers with fewer ROC rates would bring lower cooperative prices and higher profits for the PSC. Therefore, to finance the construction of domestic manufacturing companies, semi-state-owned companies or companies with expected fewer interest rates can bring more profits to the supply chain."

            "heading": "6 Conclusions",
            "text": "In this paper, the profit split problem between members of a PSC comprised of the government, the local manufacturer, the distributors, and the pharmacies in the cooperative strategy of granting the exclusive production right to a local licensed manufacturer was studied. The benefits of this strategy were outlined as reducing the ordering cost of distributors, reducing the cost of deterioration in PSC, reducing the cost of medicines and the convenience of patients, and increasing the profitability of members. For this purpose, two profit split mechanisms were used after modeling the profit and cost functions of members in the cooperative and non-cooperative strategies. The first mechanism, implemented between the main and local manufacturers, used a proportional contract based on the cooperative game theory. This mechanism was used as the performances of manufacturers in both cooperative and non-cooperative strategies were measurable. Another mechanism distributed the profit of the cooperative strategy between the government, distributors, pharmacies, and the alliance of manufacturers. After implementing the cooperative strategy, the profit split was completed by determining the price and profit margin. In this case, it was explained that due to the inability to estimate the value of all members\u2019 coalitions, it is not possible to use the known cooperative game theory models such as the Shapley value and Nash bargaining solution. However, the cost-based profit split mechanism also provides a good solution in line with many real-world issues. The necessary and sufficient conditions for the profitability of the cooperative strategy were expressed as well.\nTo validate the proposed models, some support and evidence from the literature were borrowed. It was revealed that the derived royalty rate of the proposed license contract is not far from the reported and common rate of health products (Zaharoff, 2004). The stemmed results about the desirability of the pharmaceutical supply chain of higher profits by establishing the strategic alliance consisting of patent holders with less market share in the local market and financing the alliance through lower interest rates and consequently lower risk were also confirmed by appropriate references in the literature (Bagherzadeh et al., 2019; Lauton et al., 2019; Sun et al., 2018).\nThe paper has several contributions to the literature. These include valuing intellectual property, emphasizing the capabilities of the patent holder, and determining the efforts of other members in converting the asset to profits. Such an approach not only reflects the value of the asset but also motivates members to cooperate. These efforts include reducing the deterioration due to better supply chain policies in the cooperative strategy and exercising legal authority to influence the supply chain, such as granting the exclusive production right to the cooperative alliance. Also, considering new pricing mechanisms and an innovative price scheme to distribute the revenue of the cooperation strategywere other research contributions that can be regarded as a supply chain coordinationmechanism.Asmentioned in the literature, slight changes in common pricing mechanisms of pharmaceutical products are referred to as innovative pharmaceutical pricing agreements. Therefore, the proposed pricing mechanism is based on real-world practices, which bodes another contribution of the paper. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed collaboration strategywas confirmedboth in theory andbyusing numerical results. These results of the paper not only encourage the pharmaceutical supply chains to adopt the strategy but also guide the selection of pharmaceutical brands through licensing agreements. The growth of such alliances may be evidence of the effectiveness of the strategy under study. However, this paper presents a suitable framework for evaluating and implementing the strategy.\nThe model presented in the paper was applied to a case study for producing domestic production of a brand drug for thalassemia patients. The results of this evaluation show that, as expected, the cooperative strategy provides significant profits for all members of the PSC. Based on the proposed model, the stemmed royalty rate was close to the actual implemented values, and the proposed framework was introduced as a complement to current pricing mechanisms. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis was carried out to explain the behavior of the model against some parameters. The sensitivity analysis confirmed the validity of the model and offered managerial insights for conducting pharmaceutical-related business, as explained in the previous section.\nBased on the results as well as the reviewed papers, some notes about the generalizability of the proposed model should be taken into account. The models of the paper concerned the inventory control decisions of pharmacies and distributors are very general in the PSC context as well as in other industry sectors. Only if assumptions such as the uncertainty of demand, delivery time, or even disruption are added to the business environment some adjustments are needed in the models; of course, the literature in this respect is very rich. The model that was used to set the proportional license contract is also very common in international alliances (Sercu, 2008), although it can have other forms, for example, considering an initial fee for the patent holder as a license fee or considering some share in the ownership of the alliance for it (for reasons such as exerting more control over the coalition and its output). In these cases, the proposedmodel needs a slight adjustment. The second profit split mechanism of the paper, namely the distribution based on the afforded cost of partners, has many applications in complex real-world problems as well (Hammami & Frein, 2014; Moon et al., 2015). But if it is possible to correctly estimate the cost and profit of partners for a problem and different combinations of their possible coalitions, more advanced mechanisms such as Shapley value and Nash bargaining games will definitely have more satisfactory results. However, due to the limitations of the research problem in this sense, we used this mechanism with less complexity, although it is logically fair for the distribution of profits.\nThe assumptions on which the research model was based impose limitations on its application to other case studies. For example, in the study country, the population of patients who were the target of the study drug was known and it was assumed that the necessary support from the government would be provided to cover all their demands. This assumed, fixed and known demand rates are valid in the proposed model. However, there are cases for which this hypothesis is not valid, and we need to develop the proposed model to uncertain models to evaluate them. Clearly, uncertain models have extra complexity because shortage and nonsupply of part of the order is inevitable in them. For example, conditions, where there is no guarantee for the import and introduction of newer drugs or conditions such as pandemics and epidemics that are filled with uncertainty are among cases of uncertain demand. The assumption of an equal gain in the proportional contract of the paper is another assumption that can be violated in some real-world business issues. In fact, this type of contract, which is also very common in international alliances (Sercu, 2008), is acceptable in the country under study, and contracts are usually made with international companies to adhere to this condition. But in a less controlled situation, enterprises with higher bargaining power may not be satisfied with this condition and demandmore benefits. In such a situation, competitive or bargaining models can be used for the problem of profit split.\nFor future studies, it is recommended that a model for new drugs that are subjected to greater uncertainty be provided. In this regard, it is recommended to use stochastic programming and robust and fuzzy models. Finally, it is also proposed to provide a new model for drugs that are still in the early stages of testing and auditing because their handling entails tackling more uncertainty and risks.\nDeclarations\nConflict of interest There is no conflict of interest."
