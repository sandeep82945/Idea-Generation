In particular, the competition between reactive steps proceeding via tight and loose transition states can cause problems (see e.g. ref. 2\u20135).\nA recent example from the eld of combustion chemistry are the unimolecular decomposition reactions of oxymethylene ethers (OMEs) (see e.g. ref. 6). These compounds are discussed as additives or replacements for conventional diesel fuel7\u20139 because they possess diesel-compatible properties7,8 and may be produced sustainably.10\u201312 Moreover, due to their oxygen content and the lack of C\u2013C bonds, OMEs lead to reduced soot formation and hence allow for combustion conditions where NOx emissions can be kept low.13\u201315 The smallest OME homologue, dimethoxymethane (DMM h OME-1; where n in OME-n denotes the number of CH2O units in the CH3O(CH2O)nCH3 backbone), plays a particular role because, besides representing a fuel additive in itself,13 it can also serve as a model compound for the development of combustion mechanisms for higher OMEs.6\nA key process for the autoignition of any fuel/O2 mixture is radical production from the closed-shell fuel molecule. This radical production can proceed via different pathways mainly depending on temperature. At low temperatures (T < 1000 K), bimolecular H abstraction reactions, initially by O2, are crucial whereas at higher temperatures also unimolecular decomposition reactions of the fuel molecule can become relevant (see e.g. ref. 16 and 17). If such radical-producing unimolecular decomposition channels compete with decomposition channels that yield closed-shell species, the kinetic branching ratio between these mechanistically different pathways is an inuential quantity in combustion modelling. The complicated temperature and pressure dependence of this channel branching is, however, oen difficult to quantify (see e.g. ref. 5 and the literature cited therein).\nIn the present work, we examine this problem of the competing unimolecular decomposition reactions of DMM, where the following molecular (R1)\u2013(R6) and radical (R7)\u2013(R10) decomposition channels are discussed:18\u201320\nCH3OCH2OCH3 / CH3OH + trans-CH3OCH (R1)\nCH3OCH2OCH3 / CH3OH + cis-CH3OCH (R2)\nCH3OCH2OCH3 / CH3OH + CH2OCH2 (R3)\nCH3OCH2OCH3 / H2CO + CH3OCH3 (R4)\nCH3OCH2OCH3 / H2CO + CH3CH2OH (R5)\nCH3OCH2OCH3 / CH4 + CH3OCHO (R6)\nCH3OCH2OCH3 / CH3 + OCH2OCH3 (R7)\nCH3OCH2OCH3 / CH3O + CH2OCH3 (R8)\nCH3OCH2OCH3 / CH3OCH2OCH2 + H (R9)\nCH3OCH2OCH3 / CH3OCHOCH3 + H (R10)\n666 | Faraday Discuss., 2022, 238, 665\u2013681 This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022\npe n\nA cc\nes s\nA rt\nic le\n.

In this model, the rate coefficients for the initial DMM decomposition reactions were taken from the corresponding reactions of dimethyl ether (DME) and diethyl ether (DEE). Nine years later, Dias et al.22 modelled DMM/O2/Ar ames, adopting the rate coefficients for the DMMspecic reactions from ref. 21. The same data were also used as a basis to model the results of a high-pressure ow tube study by Marroda\u0301n et al.23 in 2015. All these mechanisms21\u201323 have in common that for the unimolecular decomposition of DMM only the bond dissociation channels (R7)\u2013(R10) were considered.\nIn 2017, Sun et al.24 in their modelling of OME-3 ames included both the radical channels (R7)\u2013(R10) and the molecular elimination channel (R4), and parameterized its rate coefficient in analogy to the corresponding channel in DEE decomposition. In the same year, Hu et al.25 used a modied DMM model from Curran et al. (not readily available in the literature), which contained a channel CH3OCH2OCH3/ CH3OH + CH3 + CHO. In analogy to ref. 24, He et al.26 included in their model of OME-3 combustion, a molecular channel RH / R0H + CH2O as a general initiation step for OME-1 to OME-3. At about the same time, Vermeire et al.27 developed a model to describe DMM oxidation in jet-stirred reactor experiments but again considered only the two C\u2013O bond ssion steps. This restriction (accounting for C\u2013O bond ssion only) also applies to the models by Sun et al.,28 Peukert et al.,29 and Golka et al.30,31 (though in ref. 28, the elimination channel CH3OCH2OCH3 / CH3OH + CH3 + HCO is listed in the ESI).\nFor the rst time, two molecular elimination channels, namely (R4) and CH3OCH2OCH3 / CH3OH + CH3 + HCO, were explicitly considered and discussed by Jacobs et al.32 but with rate coefficients again from analogy considerations of DME and DEE. With this model, the authors of ref. 32 were able to describe their ignition delay time experiments as well as other experimental studies from the literature. Only in 2020, Yu et al.,18 in a micro ow-tube/photoionization study, obtained experimental evidence for CH3OH as a direct thermal decomposition product of DMM. In accompanying quantum chemical calculations at CBS-QB3 level of theory,33 a total of 6 different molecular elimination channels, (R1)\u2013 (R6), were identied.18 In particular, it was found that the threshold energies of reactions (R1)\u2013(R4) are well below the bond dissociation energies corresponding to (R7)\u2013(R10). On the basis of microcanonical rate coefficients from Rice\u2013Ramsperger\u2013Kassel\u2013Marcus (RRKM) theory,34,35 it was concluded that the latter bond dissociation reactions are unlikely as primary initial pyrolysis steps in comparison to the isomerization\u2013elimination reactions.18\nAt about the same time, Sun et al.19 characterized 8 DMM decomposition channels (2 radical, 6 molecular) by quantum chemical calculations, to model their ow reactor pyrolysis experiments. These authors19 also found the low-lying molecular elimination reactions (R1)/(R2), (R3), and (R4) as well as three H2eliminating reactions. But they concluded that under their experimental conditions (temperatures ranging from 783 to 1396 K at pressures of 30 and 760 torr), CH3OH elimination reactions are not competitive enough to notably inuence fuel consumption. In a recent purely theoretical study, Al-Otaibi et al.20\nThis journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022 Faraday Discuss., 2022, 238, 665\u2013681 | 667\npe n\nA cc\nes s\nA rt\nic le\n.

They also calculated canonical rate coefficients from RRKM theory and predicted a predominance of the bond dissociation reaction (R7) over the kinetically most favored complex decomposition reaction (R4) at p \u00bc 1 bar and T \u00bc 300\u20132000 K. Most recently, Li et al.36 modelled their high-temperature ignition delay timemeasurements (shock tube, T \u00bc 1050\u20131450 K, p \u00bc 1\u201310 atm) with an updated DMM mechanism, adopting the kinetic parameters of the radical DMM decomposition reactions from ref. 31. In this work,36 the molecular elimination channels were found to be unimportant.\nSo in total, a puzzling picture arises. On the one hand, there is striking theoretical evidence for molecular elimination channels in DMM with threshold energies well below the C\u2013O bond dissociation energies. On the other hand, it appears as if almost all DMM pyrolysis experiments performed so far (with the exception of those from ref. 18) could be well described by taking into account the bond dissociation reactions only. It is the aim of the present work to contribute to the resolution of this apparent contradiction by applying quantum chemistry, statistical rate theory and kinetic-mechanistic modelling.\nWe use highly accurate quantum chemical methods and a multi-channel master equation approach to calculate thermal rate coefficients for the unimolecular decomposition pathways of DMM as a function of temperature and pressure. We discuss the varying contributions of radical and molecular channels to the overall kinetics of DMM pyrolysis at different temperatures and pressures. On the basis of our results, we propose an updatedmechanism for DMM pyrolysis and use it to model earlier experimental data. We show that depending on the experimental conditions, either the molecular or the radical channels prevail, and we discuss the consequences for DMM pyrolysis under different experimental regimes."

From the coupled cluster benchmark study, and by taking into account the fact that transition states are involved, it appears reasonable to assume that the uncertainties in the calculated threshold energies of the present work do probably not exceed 5 kJ mol 1.\nThe rotational constants and harmonic wavenumbers necessary for the statistical rate theory calculations are given in Table S2 of the ESI.\u2020"

            "text": "As already mentioned above, the master equation was solved with DESL, representing the average energy transferred per down collision, as the only adjustable parameter. The value was tted to the temperature- and pressure-dependent rate coefficients reported in ref. 30 and 31 which were determined in shock tube experiments with time-resolved H atom detection using atom resonance absorption spectroscopy (H-ARAS). Note that in contrast to the approach in ref. 31, where only a two-channel master equation was used, the full ten-channel master equation was employed in the present work.\nIn earlier studies,29\u201331 it was concluded from qualitative mechanistic considerations that under shock tube conditions mainly the C\u2013O bond dissociation channels should contribute as rate-determining steps to hydrogen atom production. Following this assumption, we adjusted the value for DESL by tting the calculated sum of the rate coefficients of the C\u2013O bond dissociation reactions, k7 + k8, to the experimental values from ref. 30 and 31. The results for the optimum value ofDESL\u00bc 400 cm 1 are shown in Fig. 2.

As is obvious from Fig. 3, the bond dissociation reaction (R7) increasingly dominates at temperatures above 900 K, which are typical for shock tube experiments. It is followed by the molecular elimination reaction (R1) and then by reactions (R8) and (R2). All other rate coefficients are lower by at least two orders\nFig. 3 Calculated rate coefficients of reactions (R1)\u2013(R10) at a pressure of p\u00bc 1 bar; top to bottom near left axis: (R7), (R1), (R8) (red dotted), (R2) (blue dotted), (R4), (R3), (R9), (R10), (R6) and (R5).\n672 | Faraday Discuss., 2022, 238, 665\u2013681 This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022\npe n\nA cc\nes s\nA rt\nic le\n.

Among the C\u2013O bond dissociation channels, reaction (R7) clearly dominates over reaction (R8). For numerical evaluations of the rate coefficients ki(T,P), \u2018log p\u2019 parameterizations (see e.g. ref. 65) are given in Table S3 of the ESI.\u2020 To enable a direct implementation of these results into combustion modelling, machine-readable les directly suitable for OpenSMOKE or CHEMKIN simulations are also given as ESI.\u2020\nTo facilitate further discussion, Fig. 4 illustrates the pressure- and temperaturedependent switching between the combined radical and the combined molecular channels, (R7)\u2013(R10) and (R1)\u2013(R6), respectively. It is obvious that at the higher temperatures (1300 and 1800 K) the radical channels dominate at pressures above ca. 10 mbar whereas at the lower temperatures (800 K) the molecular channels prevail. This explains why in the low-temperature ow tube experiments of ref. 18 (T\u00bc 573\u20131243 K, pressure of a few tens of mbar), strong evidence for the molecular channels was found whereas these channels are much less important in the hightemperature shock tube studies of ref. 29 (T \u00bc 1100\u20131430 K, p \u00bc 1.2\u20132.5 bar) and ref. 30 and 31 (T\u00bc 1100\u20131600 K, p\u00bc 0.4, 1.1 and 4.7 bar). This is further illustrated in terms of relative branching fractions in Fig. 5. At lower temperatures near 800 K, the molecular channel (R1) dominates over the entire pressure range even though the radical channel (R7) gains some importance with increasing pressure; the relative branching fraction of the second molecular channel (R2) turns out to be nearly independent of pressure under these conditions. At higher temperatures near 1300 K, channel switching between reaction (R1), dominating at pressures below ca. 10 mbar, and reaction (R7), dominating at pressure above ca. 10 mbar, occurs. The predominance of the molecular channels in ref. 18 and the radical channel in ref. 29\u201331 becomes obvious.\nIn Fig. 6, the situation is illustrated in terms of microcanonical rate coefficients and molecular distribution functions. We show only the rate coefficients of the two most relevant molecular and radical channels. Note that a gure including all channels is given in the ESI (Fig. S2\u2020). The most important feature reecting the channel switching is the crossing of the specic rate constant curves\nFig. 4 Calculated sums of the rate coefficients for the molecular channels (R1)\u2013(R6) (blue dashed lines), for the radical channels (R7)\u2013(R10) (red dashed lines), and total rate coefficient for all channels (R1)\u2013(R10) (black solid line) at temperatures of 1800 K, 1300 K and 800 K (top to bottom).\nThis journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022 Faraday Discuss., 2022, 238, 665\u2013681 | 673\nFig. 5 Calculated relative branching fractions of (R1) (blue solid line), (R2) (blue dotted line), (R7) (red solid line), and (R8) (red dotted line) at T \u00bc 800 K (left panel) and T \u00bc 1300 K (right panel).

At lower energies, the molecular channel (R1) dominates and at higher energies the radical channel (R2) dominates. The black dashed curves represents the molecular population of DMM at selected pressures from the high-pressure limit (right-hand curve) down to a pressure of 1 mbar (lehand curve). With varying pressure, these populations move over this crossing range, sampling different ranges of energy contributing to the integrand of eqn (1). The switching of the dominating channel at pressures around p\u00bc 10 mbar for this temperature as shown in Fig. 5, right panel, is the necessary consequence. Such switching between lower lying channels with tight transition states and higher lying channels with loose transition structures is not uncommon in multichannel unimolecular reactions, and in particular subtle angular momentum effects can occur (see e.g. ref. 2\u20135 and 68).\nThe distinction between \u201ctight\u201d (sometimes referred to as \u201crigid\u201d) and \u201cloose\u201d transition states was introduced by Marcus and Rice34 and quantied later in\nFig. 6 Microcanonical rate coefficients of the most important molecular (blue solid line: (R1), blue dotted line: (R2)) and radical (red solid line: (R7), red dotted line: (R8)) channels and normalized steady-state distributions of DMM at T \u00bc 1300 K and p \u00bc 1 mbar, p \u00bc 10 mbar, p \u00bc 1 bar and p / N (dashed lines, left to right).\n674 | Faraday Discuss., 2022, 238, 665\u2013681 This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2022\npe n\nA cc\nes s\nA rt\nic le\n.

It is usually well localized and associated with a pronounced maximum of the potential energy along the reaction coordinate. In contrast, a loose transition state in a unimolecular decomposition reaction is more product-like, and its internal states are governed by the (hindered) internal rotations of the preformed fragments. It is typical for reactions with no localized maximum of the potential energy curve along the reaction coordinate but with an asymptotic approach toward the potential energy of the separated fragments. This makes the localization of a transition state structure difficult and strongly dependent on energy and total angular momentum. Due to the higher number of rotational states as compared to the number of vibrational states, a much steeper rise of the ki(E) curve arises for a loose transition state than for a tight transition state for a given reactant. This becomes obvious for the reaction system of the present work in Fig. 6 and S2.\u2020\nIn terms of canonical rate coefficients, loose transition states correspond to higher activation entropies, DS\u2021i , and hence to larger preexponential factors in the high-pressure limit as compared to tight transition states. Illustrative numerical values for the DMM unimolecular reaction channels are given in Table 2. The expected very large values of DS\u2021i for the loose bond dissociation channels (R7)\u2013 (R10) are obvious, but it can also be realized that the well localized (that is, \u201ctight\u201d) transition states of reactions (R1)\u2013(R6) can result in activation entropies distinctly above zero. Obviously, the use of DS\u2021i as a measure to formally distinguish between tight and loose transition states is limited.\nIn the following, we briey elucidate in a qualitative way, the relation between the activation entropies and the microscopic mechanisms of the molecular DMM decomposition channels (R1)\u2013(R6). The corresponding transition state structures are displayed in Fig. S1.\u2020 In reactions (R1) and (R2), a CH3O\u2013CH2 bond is broken, and simultaneously an H atom is shied from the CH2 group to the departing CH3O moiety. Though this formally gives rise to structures resembling threemembered transition states, they are comparatively loose because the C\u2013O bonds are already considerably stretched when the H atom is transferred to the O\npe n\nA cc\nes s\nA rt\nic le\n.

Similar arguments apply to reaction (R6), where a CH3\u2013O bond is broken, and an H atom is transferred from the CH2 group to the departing CH3 moiety. This explains the comparatively high values between 20 and 30 J K 1 mol 1 for DS\u20211, DS \u2021 2, and DS \u2021 6. In reaction (R3), where also a CH3O\u2013CH2 bond is broken, the transferred H atom stems from the opposite CH3 group. This obviously leads to a somewhat tighter transition state and a correspondingly lower value of DS\u20213 \u00bc 5.92 J K 1 mol 1. Reactions (R4) and (R5) follow different microscopic mechanisms. In reaction (R4), also a CH3\u2013O bond is broken, but the CH3 group is transferred to the other O atom, and simultaneously OCH2 is eliminated. That is, the formaldehyde molecule produced in (R4) contains the central CH2 group of DMM. The resulting transition state is tight, giving DS\u20214 \u00bc 0.41 J K 1 mol 1. The reaction coordinate of (R5) is very complicated. An H atom from a CH3O group moves to the b-O atom, the remaining CH2O\u2013CH2 bond is broken, and CH2O is eliminated. Simultaneously, in the other fragment a C\u2013C bond is formed yielding HOCH2CH3. Due to this complex, sterically demanding rearrangement, the activation entropy is negative with a value of DS\u20215 \u00bc 7.60 J K 1 mol 1. In terms of partition functions, the small values of DS\u20214 and DS \u2021 5 are essentially due to the absence of low-lying vibrational wavenumbers (<100 cm 1) in these very complex transition states. For amore detailed discussion of such general points, the reader is referred to standard monographs.50\u201352\nAnother aspect of the tight/loose distinction is the angular momentum dependence of the threshold energies, E0i(J). If the threshold energies are referenced to the rovibrational ground state of the reactant, that is to J \u00bc 0, they generally increase with increasing J approximately as E0i(J) z E0i(J \u00bc 0) + B\u2021i (J) J(J + 1).54 The weakly J-dependent centrifugal-corrected rotational constants, B\u2021i (J), are usually smaller for loose rather than for tight transitions states. Consequently, the differences between, or even the order of, the threshold energies, may change with increasing J. If for low J, the relation E0i(tight)(J) < E0j(loose)(J) holds, this may change into E0i(tight)(J) > E0j(loose)(J) for high J. Such behavior is sometimes called \u201crotational channel switching\u201d3,5 and occurs in particular if the differences E0j(loose)(J) E0i(tight)(J) > 0 for low J are small. For the reaction system of the present work, illustrative J-dependent threshold energies for the lowest molecular (tight) and radical (loose) channel are listed in Table S4.\u2020 It becomes obvious that the differences between these threshold energies become slightly smaller for increasing J, but rotational channel switching does not occur, even for the comparatively high temperatures between 800 and 1800 K and the correspondingly high thermal averages, hJiT. The differences in the threshold energies for J \u00bc 0 are too large. Also the use of more realistic interfragment potentials instead of the Morse functions used in the s-SACM approach53\u201355 would not change this qualitative picture."

With these data, shock tube experiments of DMM pyrolysis with H-ARAS and TOF-MS detection could be adequately modelled. From the detailedmaster equation analysis, it could be shown that C\u2013O bond dissociation channels in DMM dominate the decomposition kinetics in shock tube experiments despite the presence of energetically lower lying molecular elimination channels. The latter reactions may, however, signicantly contribute at lower temperatures and pressures, which is in line with ndings of a recent ow tube study.18 In this way, a consistent picture of the unimolecular decomposition kinetics of DMM seems to emerge. It provides an example for the capabilities and usefulness of modern unimolecular rate theory for both a fundamental understanding and a practical parameterization of important reactions in combustion chemistry.\nWhether such competition between molecular and radical decomposition channels of closed-shell species are signicant for practical combustion processes is an open question. The answer certainly depends on the specic fuel and in particular on the relevant temperature range. While at low temperatures (T < 1000 K), mainly abstraction reactions from the fuel molecule are relevant for chain initiation, unimolecular decomposition reactions may contribute at higher temperatures. Many oxygenated fuels like alcohols, esters, ethers, and furanics are known to possess molecular decomposition channels. In contrast to simple bond ssion reactions, such channels are sometimes difficult to identify by pure chemical intuition. In fact, this could be an important point, where the emerging combination of unimolecular rate theory and modern automatic mechanism generation may turn out to be useful in the future.72\u201374\nConflicts of interest\nThere are no conicts to declare."
