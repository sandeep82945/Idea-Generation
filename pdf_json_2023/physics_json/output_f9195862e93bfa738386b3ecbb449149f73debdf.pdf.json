    "abstractText": "Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disease characterized by the hyperproliferation and aberrant differentiation of epidermal keratinocytes. It is a debilitating condition that can cause significant physical and emotional distress. Natural anti-psoriatic agents have been investigated as alternatives to conventional allopathic medications, as they have notable limitations and drawbacks. Curcumin and tea tree oil are cost-efficient and effective anti-inflammatory medicines with less adverse effects compared to synthetic psoriasis medications. Our research endeavors to harness the therapeutic potential of these natural compounds by developing an herbal anti-psoriatic topical drug delivery system. This novel method uses curcumin and tea tree oil to create a bi-phasic emulgel drug delivery system. Formulations F1 (gel) and F2 (emulgel) have high drug content percentages of 84.2% and 96.7%, respectively. The emulgel showed better spreadability for cutaneous applications, with a viscosity of 92,200 \u00b1 943 cp compared to the gel\u2019s 56,200 \u00b1 1725 cp. The emulgel released 94.48% of the drugs, compared to 87.58% for the gel. These formulations conform to the zero-order and Higuchi models, and their stability over a three-month period is crucial. In vivo, the emulgel healed psoriasis symptoms faster than the usual gel. The gathered results confirmed the emulgel\u2019s potential as a drug delivery method, emphasizing the complementary benefits of tea tree oil and curcumin as an effective new therapy for psoriasis.",

Psoriasis is an inflammatory skin disorder brought on by misguided T lymphocytes. The skin of psoriasis patients may be rough and bumpy because of their high cell turnover [1]. Psoriatic skin becomes red, flaky, and thick due to an increase in keratinocytes, new\nGels 2023, 9, 973. https://doi.org/10.3390/gels9120973 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/gels\nGels 2023, 9, 973 2 of 15\nblood vessel growth, and immune cell infiltration. Since there is currently no cure and conventional treatments have their limits, natural anti-psoriatic remedies have been the subject of much research. There is not a lot written about using herbs to treat psoriasis. Psoriasis treatments, especially those used topically, need prolonged application [2]. This is especially challenging when the drugs are taken orally, as liquids are eliminated rapidly via the skin. Tight skin makes it difficult for drugs to enter the body, reducing their efficacy [3]. Psoriasis treatments have always been limited by these factors. Hydrogels with built-in pharmaceuticals might improve transdermal drug delivery. As a result, improved methods of drug retention and distribution in topical anti-psoriatic medications are urgently required [4]. Curcumin has a demonstrated ability to mitigate inflammatory responses in a manner akin to the impact of steroids, but devoid of any associated side effects [5]. The challenges of water insolubility, reduced potency, and instability are common issues encountered in various herbal remedies [6,7]. Extensive first-pass metabolism occurs, making it a suitable candidate for topical gel formulations [8,9]. Further, tea tree oil possesses significant antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory properties [10,11]. Terpinen-4-ol has the potential to inhibit the production of various inflammatory mediators, such as interleukins, by human peripheral blood monocytes [12]. This finding suggests a plausible mechanism by which tea tree oil might mitigate the typical inflammatory response in conditions like psoriasis by acting beneath the dermal layer. However, there is currently no documented research on the combined effects of both substances in the form of an anti-psoriatic emulgel. Consequently, there is a need for a delivery system that can facilitate transdermal drug release and demonstrate its therapeutic effects. The first line of defense against psoriasis is a topical therapy [13]. There is a need for a more effective medication delivery method since patients are less likely to comply with long-term therapy when using the current formulation (ointment), because it is oily and causes irritation. Nanoemulsions are kinetically stable systems with a size range of 20\u2013200 nm, making them suitable for topical delivery [14]. Since psoriatic skin is rough and encrusted with plaques, their nano-sized nature provides higher penetration and retention into the skin, which is desirable in psoriasis. In addition, nanoemulsions may be readily transformed into a gel, which improves skin hydration and medication delivery into the skin, increases patient compliance thanks to its non-greasy and non-sticky nature, and offers prolonged drug administration. In our present study, we have developed transdermal preparations loaded with curcumin using tea tree oil, aiming to enhance both the effectiveness and transdermal drug delivery, while exploring the potential synergistic effects of tea tree oil in combination with curcumin."

            "text": "The solubility of curcumin was investigated across various mediums, including oils, surfactants, and co-surfactants. Among the oils examined, tea tree oil exhibited a notably higher solubility for curcumin compared to other oils, as depicted in Figure 1A. Within the realm of surfactants, Tween 80 demonstrated an enhanced solubility for curcumin in contrast to other surfactants, as illustrated in Figure 1B. Similarly, in the domain of co-surfactants, curcumin exhibited a heightened solubility in propylene glycol as opposed to other co-surfactants, as indicated in Figure 1C. Due to the fact that it is non-ionic, Tween 80 is frequently used in topical nanoemulsions, as was discovered in a previous study [15]. The concentration of the surfactant that is employed should be safe, since it should reduce the interfacial tension and play a significant role in the development of nanoemulsions. It is for this reason that non-ionic surfactants are favored over ionic surfactants since non-ionic surfactants are thought to be less harmful than ionic surfactants.\nGels 2023, 9, 973 3 of 15Gels 2023, 9, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 16\nFigure 1.

Drug Content of Curcumin in Gel and Emulgel\nThe drug content of all batches of curcumin-loaded gel and curcumin-loaded emulgel is provided in Table 2. The formulation batch code F1 indicates that the prepared gel has a high content of the drug. The formulation batch code F2 reveals that the prepared emulgel has a high drug content compared to others. Hence, F1 and F2 of the curcumin-loaded gel and curcumin-loaded emulgel, respectively, were selected for further examination and characterization.\n2.2.3. Measurement of pH\nThe pH value of the curcumin-loaded gel was determined to be 5.1 \u00b1 0.2, while the pH value of the curcumin-loaded emulgel was found to be 6.1 \u00b1 0.3. The obtained results are favorable and satisfactory, and they do not cause skin irritation when used.\n2.2.4. Viscosity Measurement\nThe viscosity of any composition is important for its stability. The viscosity for both formulations was measured with a Brookfield viscometer. The viscosity of the produced topical formulations (gel or emulgel) was assessed, with the results displayed in Table 3. Because the rheological behavior of the gel and emulgel controls their flowability, spreadability, and drug penetration, it is one of the crucial parameters for the characterization of formulations for topical applications. Both the gel and the emulgel that was created exhibited flow behaviors indicative of pseudoplasticity. This behavior occurs because the polymeric matrix contains a colloidal network that, upon the application of shear thickening fluid, realigns itself and, as a result, the viscosity of the matrix decreases as the shear rate rises.\n2.2.5. Spreadability\nThe \u2018slip\u2019 and \u2018drag\u2019 qualities of the gel and emulgel are used to determine their spreadability, which is critical for drug absorption through the skin. The results are shown in Table 3. Spreadability is significant for patient compliance since it facilitates the administration of gel in a consistent manner to the patient\u2019s skin. The spreading of a good gel should take less time than normal, and the gel should be easily spreadable.\n2.2.6. Centrifugation Test\nAll the centrifugation test data of the formulation batches were visually confirmed. Following this test, we discovered that all batches were stable and that no phase separation was observed, which indicates good stability.\n2.2.7.

Our investigation revealed that these formulations exhibited favorable physical properties and demonstrated a significant anti-psoriatic effect. Over a 90-day physical stability test, the curcumin-loaded formulation remained stable, with no significant changes in appearance, pH, viscosity, or drug content. The release kinetics of curcumin from both the gel and emulgel followed a zero-order and Higuchi model, indicating a controlled release profile. In an in vivo study using an IMQ-induced psoriasis model, the curcuminloaded emulgel displayed superior anti-psoriatic efficacy compared to the curcumin-loaded gel. This suggests that the emulgel formulation holds promise for improving the topical effectiveness of poorly permeable curcumin in the long-term management of psoriasis. Additionally, our data demonstrated that tea tree oil substantially enhanced the in vivo activity of curcumin-loaded formulations, particularly the curcumin-loaded emulgel, highlighting a synergistic effect between curcumin and tea tree oil. In conclusion, the emulgel formulation has the potential to serve as a viable vehicle for the transdermal delivery of curcumin."

In the preparation of a curcumin nanoemulsion, tea tree oil was employed in the oil phase, Tween 80 served as the surfactant PG and as the co-surfactant, and ethyl alcohol served as a solvent. Initially, curcumin was mixed with tea tree oil to form the oil phase and vortexed, followed by the addition of the surfactant PG and co-surfactant; then, 20 mL of water was added with continuous stirring to obtain the nanoemulsion. The base of the gel was produced by dissolving a measured amount of gelling reagent within water. The emulsion loaded with curcumin was gradually mixed with a Heidolph RZR 1 mixer (Heidolph Instruments, Schwabach, Germany) for 5 min at 3000 rpm until a uniform emulgel was achieved [7]. The specific compositions of the curcumin-loaded emulgel are detailed in Table 6.\n4.5. Characterization of Gel and Emulgel 4.5.1.

The zeta potential was measured via Laser Doppler Electrophoresis after vigorous mixing and 200-fold dilution in deionized distilled water [15].\n4.5.8. FTIR and DSC of Gel and Emulgel\nAn FTIR spectroscopy analysis was used to assess the interaction and compatibility of the medication as well as the additional inert ingredients within the composition. The FTIR spectroscopy was carried out using an FTIR spectrometer. When a certain amount of material was mixed with potassium bromide, the FTIR spectra for the pure medicine (curcumin) and excipients were observed (KBr). The transmission mode scanning technique was used, with wavenumbers ranging from 4000 to 400 cm\u22121 [25]. Curcumin dispersion and incorporation in the lyophilized nanoemulsions were measured using the DSC technique [11]. A total of 10 mL of the nanoemulsion was lyophilized with 5% (w/v) mannitol at \u221220 \u25e6C in a freeze-dryer (HetoDrywinner, Copenhagen, Denmark). In summary, 4 mg of the lyophilized sample was heated at 20 \u25e6C/min from 40 to 200 \u25e6C with 20 mL/min of inert gas nitrogen, using an empty pan as a reference.\n4.5.9. In Vitro Drug Release Study\nFranz diffusion cells or egg membranes were utilized in the drug release study. One gram of the formulation was distributed on the egg membrane\u2019s surface and clamped between the diffusion cell\u2019s donor and receptor chamber. This included 200 mL of diffusion\nGels 2023, 9, 973 13 of 15\nmedium (phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, containing 25% methanol), which had been warmed at 37 \u00b1 1 \u25e6C and stirred continuously at 100 rpm with a magnetic stirrer. During various fixed periods, 10 mL of sample were taken through receptor media. Withdrawn samples were replaced with fresh medium in an equivalent amount. The specimen had been compared to a blank around 425 nm utilizing a UV spectrophotometer [26].\n4.5.10. Kinetic Study\nThe profile of an in vitro release of medication was utilized to examine the correlation coefficient (r2) and release kinetics of curcumin-loaded compositions. This was achieved by plotting the concentration of the drug with time. The following kinetic models were used in this research [27].\na. Zero-order equation Q1 = Q0 + K0 t; b. First-order equation lnQ1 = lnQ0 \u00d7 K0 t; c. Higuchi model Q = KH t1/2; d. Korsemeyer\u2013Peppas equation Mt/M\u221e = Ktn.\nQ1 is the initial amount of the drug dissolved at time t, Q0 is the initial amount of the drug in the solution, K0 is the zero-order release rate constant, K1 is the first-order release rate constant, Q is the amount of the drug released at time t per unit area, KH is the Higuchi diffusion rate constant, Mt and M\u221e are the amounts of the drug released at time t and infinite time, K is the release rate constant, and n is the drug release exponent. The model that created a linear plot and had the highest (r2) value was the best fit for the drug release data [28]."

The anti-psoriatic activity animal protocol has been approved via the Institutional Animal Ethics Committee (SRMS CET Bareilly, Ref.no 715/PO/Re/S/02/CPCSEA) and the studies were carried out according to their standards. The anti-psoriatic activity of the produced formulations was tested using male Albino rats (6\u20138 weeks old, weight about 20\u201330 g). The rats are housed in standard laboratory conditions (temperature: 25 \u00b1 2 \u25e6C, relative humidity: 55 \u00b1 5%). The animals had unlimited access to laboratory meals and water. The topical use of marketed imiquimod cream (5% w/w. Glenmark pharmaceutical Ltd., Mumbai, India) was used for producing psoriasis. the dorsal area of male albino rats was shaved. Psoriasis was induced after ten consecutive days of topically applying the imiquimod cream (62.5 mg/day). When psoriasis was induced, the animals were separated into three groups: group A, group B, and group C. Group A received no treatment, while group B and C received the curcumin-loaded gel and curcumin nanogel (equal to 100 mg curcumin), respectively. The medication was continued for 10 days after psoriasis was induced. As described by Mittal et al., 2021, PASI scoring (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4) was used to measure the severity of psoriasis. Symptoms such as redness, thickness, and scaling was assessed as none, mild, moderate, severe, or extremely severe [15]."
