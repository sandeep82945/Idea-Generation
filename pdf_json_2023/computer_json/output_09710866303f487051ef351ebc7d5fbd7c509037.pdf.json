Tools 41 to evaluate the built environment using machine vision and informatic approaches has been limited. We 42 sought to investigate the association between machine vision-based built environment and prevalence of 43 cardiometabolic disease in urban cities. 44 Methods: This cross-sectional study used features extracted from Google Street view (GSV) images to 45 measure the built environment and link them with prevalence of cardiometabolic disease. Convolutional 46 neural networks, light gradient boosting machines and activation maps were utilized to predict health 47 outcomes and identify feature associations with coronary heart disease (CHD). The study obtained 0.53 48 million GSV images covering 789 census tracts in 7 cities (Cleveland, OH; Fremont, CA; Kansas City, MO; 49 Detroit, MI; Bellevue, WA; Brownsville, TX; and Denver, CO). Analyses were conducted from February 5",

We 42\nsought to investigate the association between machine vision-based built environment and prevalence of 43\ncardiometabolic disease in urban cities. 44\nMethods: This cross-sectional study used features extracted from Google Street view (GSV) images to 45\nmeasure the built environment and link them with prevalence of cardiometabolic disease. Convolutional 46\nneural networks, light gradient boosting machines and activation maps were utilized to predict health 47\noutcomes and identify feature associations with coronary heart disease (CHD). The study obtained 0.53 48\nmillion GSV images covering 789 census tracts in 7 cities (Cleveland, OH; Fremont, CA; Kansas City, MO; 49\nDetroit, MI; Bellevue, WA; Brownsville, TX; and Denver, CO). Analyses were conducted from February 50\n2022 to December 2022. We used census tract-level data from the Centers for Disease Control and 51\nPrevention\u2019s PLACES dataset. Main outcomes included census tract-level estimated prevalence of CHD 52\nbased on GSV built environment features. 53\nResults: Built environment features extracted from GSV using deep learning predicted 63% of the census 54\ntract variation in CHD prevalence. The ExtraTrees Regressor achieved the best result among all models 55\nwith the lowest average mean absolute error of 1.11% and Root mean square of error of 1.58. The 56\naddition of GSV features outperformed and improved a model that only included census-tract level age, 57\nsex, race, income and education. Activation maps from the features revealed a set of neighborhood 58\nfeatures represented by buildings and roads associated with CHD prevalence. 59\nConclusions: In this cross-sectional study, a significant portion of CHD prevalence were explained by GSV-60\nbased built environment factors analyzed using deep learning, independent of census tract demographics. 61\nMachine vision enabled assessment of the built environment could help play a significant role in designing 62\nand improving heart-heathy cities. 63\nIntroduction 64 Coronary heart disease (CHD) accounts for over 50% of mortality from heart disease in the United States, 65 responsible for nearly 400,000 deaths in 20201. Despite advances in prevention and treatment over the 66 past decade in the United States2 CHD remains the leading cause of death in the United States since 1950 67 with increasing evidence for non-conventional risk factors playing a large than anticipated role than 68 previously suspected1,3. 69 70 Socioenvironmental factors are amongst the leading non-traditional risk factors increasingly implicated in 71 CHD development4\u20136. These factors include social determinants such as race, income, education, and 72 culture as well as the factors in the built environment and factors in the ambient environment such as 73 noise, and air pollution all of which have been to exert significant effects on CHD. 5\u20138 74 75 Large-scale integrated assessment of the environment at the neighborhood can facilitate rapid and 76 complete assessment of its impact on CHD. Such data is however scarce, partly because of the costly and 77 time-consuming nature of neighborhood audits, and inconsistent measurements and standards for data 78 collection. Machine vision approaches such as Google Street View (GSV) has become an increasingly 79 popular approach for virtual neighborhood audits since its launch in 2007. GSV image coverage has been 80 consistently expanding in recent years achieving almost full coverage in the United States9. Previous 81 studies have shown GSV results are comparable to field assessments and have been used to assess the 82 built environment features such as greenspace10,11, buildings12, and roads13. 83 84 GSV images further become a favored data source for large-scale studies due to the open availability of 85 such data, arguably the largest compendium of machine vision enabled assessment of large tracts of the 86 earth, and the standardized approaches used. Deep learning approaches such as convolutional neural 87 networks (CNN) have been widely used in many studies and applications, given their excellent 88 performance in tasks such as image classification, object detection, and image segmentation14. The use of 89 such approaches to rapidly assess and extract built environment features from GSV images using deep 90 learning can help facilitate integrated assessment and capture other aspects that may not be otherwise 91 included. The goal of this study is to use GSV images to assess built environment and use them to estimate 92 CHD prevalence at the census tract level. 93 94 Methods 95 Data source for coronary heart disease 96 The prevalence of census-tract coronary heart disease (CHD) was obtained from the CDC PLACES, a project 97 that provided chronic disease risk factors, health outcomes, and clinical preventive services. This project, 98 is a collaboration between the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the Robert Wood 99 Johnson Foundation, and the CDC Foundation, measures CHD prevalence using data from Behavioral Risk 100 Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), where people aged \u226518 are surveyed to report whether or not they 101\nhave been told by a doctor, nurse, or other health professional that they had angina or coronary heart 102 disease. We collected the CHD prevalence data for 789 census tracts in 7 cities: Bellevue, WA; Brownsville, 103 TX; Cleveland, OH; Denver, CO; Detroit, MI; Fremont, CA; and Kansas City, KS. 104 105 Google street view data 106 Environment information was derived from approximately 0.53 million GSV images for the 7 cities (143K 107 for Detroit, 59K for Kansas City, 70K for Cleveland, 65K for Brownsville, 38K for Fremont, 35K for Bellevue, 108 and 120K for Denver). The GSV images were downloaded via Google Street View Static Application 109 Programming Interface (API) from 2020-2021. GSV API provides users with street-level panoramic 110 imagery which captures the visual domain of pedestrians in thousands of cities worldwide. The GSV 111\nimages of each census tract were downloaded in a grid pattern in the corresponding tract with an interval 112 of 100m. At each location where GSV images were retrieved, four images were gathered from different 113 directions (i.e., the cardinal directions: N, E, S, and W.), which composes a panoramic view of the 114 surroundings at that location. When latitude and longitude coordinates are provided, the API searches 115 within a 50-meter radius for a photograph closest to this location. The API would not return any images 116 if no available images could be found. 117 118 To process these images and gain environment information from them, a pre-trained deep convolutional 119 neural network (DCNN) Place365 CNN 15 was used as the feature extractor to obtain the deep features of 120 the image. Here, the deep features are the outputs of the deep layers in the hierarchy of the network. 121 Compared with the shallow features in the shallow layers, these deep features represent the semantic 122 information of the GSV images. Details of how the extraction was performed can be found in e Figure 1 in 123 the Supplement. We used Place365 CNN as the feature extractor because the images trained on Place365 124 CNN are more similar to that of GSV. Place365 CNN was trained on the subset of Places Database, which 125 contains more than 10 million images consisting of 400+ unique scene categories such as towers, soccer 126 fields, streets, swimming pools, and train station platforms. Compared with the ImageNet database, the 127 diversity of environmental features found in the Places Database was believed to be representative of 128 what is contained in GSV images. Through feature extraction, we obtained 4096 features representing the 129 average built environment information for each census tract. 130 131 Statistical Analysis 132 Features Visualization using Grad-CAM 133 Elastic net regression models16 were used to estimate the census tract-level CHD prevalence by using the 134 DCNN-extracted features from GSV images. There are 4096 features and elastic net can handle this high 135 dimensional data by applying L1 and L2 regularization. Ten-fold cross-validation was repeated 3 times to 136 find the best parameters of the elastic net. Elastic net can select important features by simultaneously 137 performing feature selection and feature shrinkage, so we used it to select top features according to the 138 coefficients of each feature. The top features can be evaluated by examining the magnitudes and signs of 139 their coefficients in the elastic net mode, thus understanding how each feature is associated with CHD 140 prevalence. The top features were then visualized as the saliency map in the original GSV images using 141 Grad-CAM technique17, which provides certain explanations of what environmental features the CNN 142 thinks to be associated with neighborhood CHD prevalence. 143 144 Machine Learning Models with CNN-extracted Features 145 A variety of machine-learning predictive models were used and compared to explore the association 146 between the CNN-extracted features of GSV images and the tract-level CHD prevalence. The models for 147 this analysis included ExtraTrees regressor (ET), AdaBoost regressor (AB), Random Forest Regressor (RF), 148 Gradient Boosting Regressor (GB), Extreme Gradient Boosting Regressor (XGB), and Light Gradient 149 Boosted Machine Regressor (LGBM). All models were estimated using a 10-fold cross-validation technique 150 for a more robust result. For 10-fold cross-validation, the dataset is split into 10 equal-sized subsets, and 151 the model is trained on 9 subsets and tested on the remaining 1 subset. This process is repeated 10 times 152 until all 10 subsets were used once as the testing set. R-squared values were reported as the measure of 153 association between the CNN-extracted features of GSV images and the tract-level CHD prevalence. The 154 performance of each model was also evaluated using the mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean 155 squared error (RMSE). 156 157 Multilevel Modeling with Demographics and Socio-Economic Factors 158\nWe analyzed the effects of common demographic and socio-economic factors (DSE) as well as CNN-159 extracted features of GSV images (GSV) associated with the CHD. We built multilevel regression models 160 to account for the effect of these factors including city, age, sex, race, income and education. A 161 multivariate Sparse Partial Least Squares (SPLS) regression18 was applied first to the CNN-extracted 162 features to reduce the dimensionality issue and the effect of noise. The selected SPLS components and 163 the demographic and socio-economic factors were then used to fit a Linear Mixed-Effect regression model. 164 Three models were compared in this analysis: 1) a model containing both DSE factors and SPLS 165 components (Combined Model); 2) a model with DSE factors alone (DSE Model); 3) a model with the SPLS 166 components alone (GSV Model). Model performance was assessed using goodness of fits measures such 167 as Likelihood Ratios Tests (as it applied), AIC and BIC criteria. In addition, all models were compared by 168 using R squared values obtained from a Light Gradient Boosted Machine (LGBM) and Random Forest (RF) 169 predictive model, which represent the amount of variance explained by each set of independent variables. 170 The comparison was done using a 10-fold cross validation scheme. 171 172 Results 173 Regression results with CNN Features 174 The 4096 CNN-extracted features from GSV images were able to explain more than 63% of the variance 175 (R2 = 0.634) on the tract-level CHD prevalence in 7 cities (Figure 1). The ET achieved the best result among 176 all models with the lowest average MAE of 1.11 and RMSE of 1.58. The actual estimate from CDC\u2019s CHD 177 prevalence and the model-predicted CHD prevalence were mapped for all census tracts in 7 cities (Figure 178 2). There was a good agreement between the actual estimates and predicted CHD prevalence across all 179 census tracts in 7 cities. We found a small number of extreme values that were underestimated by the 180 models in certain census tracts of Detroit and Cleveland. The CHD prevalence of these underestimated 181 census tracts was often more than 12%. When examining the CNN-extracted features using t-SNE, we 182 noticed clustering of census tracts with similar values of CHD prevalence (eFigure2 in the supplement) 183 184 185 Visualization of Top CNN Features 186 Grad-CAM was utilized to visualize top CNN-extracted features identified from the elastic net model. The 187 saliency maps generated by the Grad-CAM, suggested that feature #1555, which seemed to highlight 188 deteriorated buildings (suggesting neighborhood blight), had a positive association with CHD prevalence 189 (Figure 3a). Another feature (feature #484) that was positively associated with CHD was found to be 190 highlighting road cracks as shown in Figure 3b. In contrast, feature #204 in Figure 3c had a negative 191 association with CHD prevalence, and its heatmap highlighted trees along the road. Feature #1732, 192 seeming to focus on well built houses, also had a negative association with CHD prevalence (Figure 3d). 193 194 195 Comparison of CNN Features with Demographics and Socio-Economic Factors 196 With SPLS, an optimal model was obtained with h = 7 SPLS components (\u03b7 = 0.6), yielding a model with 197 816 CNN-extracted features that explain \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc4c 2 > 66.7% variance of CHD prevalence in the census tracts. 198 All three models were compared with Table 1 shows model comparisons for all three models Likelihood 199 Ratios Tests (LRT, also see eMethods in the Supplement). eTable 1 in the Supplement shows the 200 corresponding regression estimates and ANOVA results. Table 2 and Supplemental eTable 2 show the 201 amount of total explained variance of the GSV models and demographic and socioeconomic (DSE) 202 variables (Table 2: LGBM, eTable 2: RF). After adjusting for each individual variable, we found that the 203 combined model (GSV + DSE) demonstrated a better Goodness of Fit, with statistically significant higher 204 log-likelihood and lower AIC/BIC when compared to GSV or DSE model alone (Table 1). Also, we found 205 that nearly all the SPLS components are statistically significant (eTable 1 in the Supplement). Although the 206\nDSE model has lower AIC and BIC values, with a significant LRT, when compared to the GSV model alone 207 (Table 1), the GSV features alone explain more variance of CHD prevalence than the DSE variables (Table 208 2). Altogether, this indicates that GSV features and traditional demographics and socio-economics 209 variables are both significantly associated and predictive of CHD prevalence. 210 211 Discussion 212 While many epidemiological studies have examined associations between cardiovascular disease and 213 individual built environmental features (e.g. greenspace, urban architecture, street connectivity, food 214 availability), our approach focused on machine vision derived physical environment, relying on 215 convolutional neural networks (CNN) and its related techniques to extract features. 216 217 Our results showed a good association (R2 = 0.634) between the CNN-extracted features from GSV and 218 CHD at the census tract level in 7 cities. This indicated that the CNN-extracted features could capture 219 neighborhood features impacting cardiovascular health. The predicted CHD prevalence using CNN-220 extracted features tended to underestimate in certain areas compared to observed CHD prevalence 221 especially in Detroit and Cleveland. This may suggest that certain CHD-related factors may either not be 222 embedded in these environments at these locations or that perhaps features not captured by street view 223 images, such as demographic factors, ambient factors and other demographic and traditional variables 224 may play a much larger role in these environments. 225 226 Our approach took the advantage of the knowledge that fully connected layers in the CNN contain 227 condensed information of the input imagery that can be extracted and utilized for a variety of purposes. 228 We utilized a pre-trained deep convolutional neural network (DCNN) Place365 CNN15, so that the deep 229 features from the CNN may be more representative of the built environment. One advantage of this 230 approach is that predefined relevant features in the built environment is not required. The 4096-231 dimensional deep features embeds all essential information of the built environment in the imagery so 232 that we could retain relevant features as much as reasonably possible. Conversely, the disadvantage of 233 using deep features from a pre-trained CNN is that it becomes difficult to identify corresponding physical 234 features that impact CHD at the neighborhood level. To alleviate this issue and provide certain 235 interpretations of the deep features, we utilized Grad-CAM techniques to visualize the CHD-related 236 features with a saliency map. 237 238 Grad-CAM highlighted several potential built environment features that are either associated with higher 239 or lower CHD at the neighborhood level. Deteriorated houses and roads are a feature of urban blight 240 associated with higher CHD. This feature may in turn embody other features in the neighborhood that 241 drive cardiovascular risk, including lack of space for physical activity7,19, limited access to nutritionally-242 balanced food20, lack of access to health care21. Street greenery on the other hand was highlighted as 243 associated with lower CHD prevalence. This agrees with previous studies that showed a robust association 244 between green space and decreased cardiovascular risks22,23. 245 246 The results of multilevel modeling using demographics and socio-economic factors, indicate that 247 demographics and socio-economic variables, were still better predictors of CHD prevalence, than GSV 248 features. One explanation is obviously the fact that physical environmental feature even if they represent 249 a \u201cmeta\u201d framework for other mediators, may not be sufficient to convey the risk conveyed by other 250 factors which may be sparsely represented. Another reason may be that GSV features may engender 251 increased model complexity, by virtue of including 4096 features (Table 1). However, GSV features alone 252 could still explain preponderant proportion of variance in CHD prevalence (Table 2 and eTable1 in the 253 Supplement). Therefore, by incorporating GSV features into regular DSE variables, one could help improve 254\nthe prediction of CHD prevalence at the neighborhood level. Our results further suggest that GSV features 255 indeed may be helpful in highlighting specific built environment information related to CHD prevalence at 256 the neighborhood level as illustrated by Grad-CAM methods, which provided a way of identifying built 257 environment information. 258 259 There are multiple limitations of this study that should be noted. Firstly, the GSV images used in the study 260 are only available along major streets and roads, and there are some populations who do not live in such 261 neighborhood. However, given the fact that most population live around the urban neighborhood where 262 GSV are abundant, we believe this would not significantly affect the results for majority of census tracts. 263 Further, although Place365 database contains 400+ unique scene categories, it may not include all 264 features that can be found in the built environment. Small objects such as trash, other environmental 265 pollutants and physical domains that may translate into better urban quality of life, may be difficult for 266 computer vision techniques like CNN to detect in a GSV image 24. Additionally, the census tracts with CHD 267 prevalence data are from 7 representative U.S cities of CDC PLACES dataset, and may not generalize to all 268 census tracts in the U.S., especially rural areas25. Future work is needed to examinate the disparities of 269 urban and rural areas and its cardiovascular-related built environment features. 270 271 Conclusion 272 Built environment impacts cardiovascular health outcome. In this study, we used Google Street View (GSV) 273 and a scene-pretrained convolutional neural network (CNN) to assess the built environment. We found 274 CNN-extracted features explain significant portion of coronary heart disease (CHD) prevalence at the 275 census tract level. Compared to traditional demographic and socio-economic factors, GSV provides unique 276 information that may relate to CHD such as buildings, greenspace and roads as suggested by the activation 277 maps from Grad-CAM technique. The outcomes of our study provides proof of concept for machine-vision 278 enabled identification of urban network features associated with risk that in principle, may enable rapid 279 identification and targeting interventions in at-risk neighborhoods to reduce cardiovascular burden. 280 281 References 282 1.

To assess the contribution of these 409\neffects besides the CNN-extracted features to the crude prevalence of CHD a multilevel-level regression 410\nmodel was built to simultaneously account for the effect of City, as well as variables Age (Median), Sex 411\n(Female %), Race (White %), Income (Median $), and Education (< High School %) in addition to the 4096 412\nCNN-extracted features. Further, to reduce the dimensionality of the problem and to reduce the effect 413\nof noise on the error rates of our inferences, we followed a two-step modeling strategy. In the first step, 414 a multivariate Sparse Partial Least Squares (SPLS) regression27 was applied to the CNN-extracted 415\nfeatures to consider a reduced set of selected SPLS components (latent variables/factors), to which 416\ndimension reduction was further applied by imposing sparsity on their loadings (CNN-extracted 417\nfeatures). This was done by using shrinkage estimates of regression coefficients (loadings of component) 418\nwith combined L1- and L2-penalized estimation. The two tuning parameters of the multivariate Sparse 419\nPLS regression model are: (i) the number \u210e \u2208 [1, \ud835\udc5a\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc5b (\ud835\udc5d, ( \ud835\udc53\u22121\n\ud835\udc53 )\ud835\udc5b)] of components that enter the Linear 420\nMixed Effects Model (where f is the number of folds and p is the dimensionality and n is the sample 421\nsize), and (ii) the sparsity parameter that controls the amount of shrinkage by a combination of the L1- 422\nand L2-penalties. Both were tuned simultaneously by 10-fold Cross-Validation. In the second step, a 423\nMixed-Effect regression model was fitted with the first few selected SPLS components augmented with 424\nthe other Demographics and Socio-Economic variables, all treated here as fixed-effects, and where City 425\nwas treated as a random effect. Departure from normality of the univariate dependent variable (CHD 426\nPrevalence) was tested by EDA analysis and Shapiro-Wilks test. A Box-Cox transformation of the 427\nresponse was applied to minimize departure from normality. Because the dependent variables are 428\ncontinuous, modeling was done by fitting a Linear Mixed Effects Model (LMM). The modeling is entirely 429\nsupervised because multivariate SPLS regression seeks latent components that not only capture the 430\nmost variance in the X-space (multivariate independent variables) but also the most covariance with the 431\nresponse Y (univariate dependent variable of disease prevalence). Finally, AIC and BIC criteria as well as 432\nLikelihood Ratios Tests (as it applied) were used for model comparison between the full model and the 433\nreduced models with the Demographics and Socio-Economic variables alone or the selected SPLS 434 components alone. Goodness of fit results of all models were also compared by the R2 amount of 435\nexplained variance achieved by each set of independent variables in the cross validated Random Forest 436\n(RF) and Light Gradient Boosted Machine (LGBM) predictive models as described above. 437\nComparison of CNN Features with Recognized Factors 438\nAn optimal model could be obtained after model parameter tuning by cross-validation with a maximum 439\nof h = 7 SPLS components and \u03b7 = 0.6, yielding a final model comprising s = 2031 selected loadings or 440\nCNN-extracted features. This resulted in a SPLS model with a cumulative explained variance of CHD: 441 \ud835\udc45\ud835\udc4b\ud835\udc4c 2 > 66.7%. Additional selection of the CNN-extracted features was done by excluding loadings with 442\n0-containing 95% bootstrapped confidence intervals, resulting in a final model of CHD: s = 816 loadings. 443\nModel specification only included main random and fixed effects and no random interaction effect was 444\nfound significant. Also, a structure for the covariance matrix was deemed not necessary (not statistically 445\nsignificantly different). 446\nWe further refer to the Google Satellite View (GSV) model, as the reduced LMM model where only the 447\nselected SPLS components (CHD: h = 7) obtained from the full CNN features enter into the model. 448\nLikewise, we refer to the Demographics and Socio-Economic (DSE) model, as the reduced LMM model 449\nwhere only the Demographics and Socio-Economic variables enter into the model. We compared the 450\nregression estimates and Goodness of Fit (GOF) measures between these reduced models and the 451\nCombined LMM model, where both sets of independent variables enter simultaneously. For all three 452\nmodels, Table 1 shows model comparisons by GOF and Likelihood Ratios Tests (LRT), and Supplemental 453\neTable 1 shows the corresponding regression estimates and ANOVA results.
