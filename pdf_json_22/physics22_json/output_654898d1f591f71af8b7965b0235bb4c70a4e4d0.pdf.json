    "abstractText": "Cobalt based sulphides of compositional formula Co3A2S2 (A = Sn and In) are endowed with frustrated kagome lattice structure and a plethora of novel phenomena determined from the topological band structure. Here-in, we report on the detailed exploration of anisotropic magnetic properties of single crystals of ferromagnetic compound Co3Sn2S2. A low temperature clustered-glassy magnetic behaviour is revealed in field-cooled and zero field-cooled magnetization and memory effect measurement protocols. The sharp downturn and non-linearity observed in the inverse susceptibility above the critical temperature TC in the paramagnetic region corroborates to the presence of short-range ferromagnetic clusters above TC in Co3Sn2S2. The deviation from linear Curie-Weiss behaviour in the paramagnetic state signifies the strong Griffiths singularity in the material. The slow spin dynamics behaviour and zero spontaneous magnetization above TC give an evidence of Griffiths phase owing to the ferromagnetic clusters. The magnetic hysteresis loops represent the magnetization reversal which, in turn, also indicate the short range magnetic correlations, and reflect the coexistence of hard and soft magnetic phases in Co3Sn2S2. The Arrott plots derived from magnetization reveal convex type curvature at low fields and linear positive behaviour in the high field region, confirming the second order magnetic phase transition in Co3Sn2S2. The Takahashi spin fluctuation theory analysis provides a sufficient evidence for itinerant ferromagnetism in Co3Sn2S2. A large magnetocrystalline anisotropy concomitant with a high anisotropy field suggests the dominance of strong spin orbit coupling phenomenon. Our experimental results emphasize an intuitive understanding of the complex nature of magnetism present in Co-based shandite systems.",

Here-in, we report on the detailed exploration of anisotropic magnetic properties of single crystals of ferromagnetic compound Co3Sn2S2. A low temperature clustered-glassy magnetic behaviour is revealed in field-cooled and zero field-cooled magnetization and memory effect measurement protocols. The sharp downturn and non-linearity observed in the inverse susceptibility above the critical temperature TC in the paramagnetic region corroborates to the presence of short-range ferromagnetic clusters above TC in Co3Sn2S2. The deviation from linear Curie-Weiss behaviour in the paramagnetic state signifies the strong Griffiths singularity in the material. The slow spin dynamics behaviour and zero spontaneous magnetization above TC give an evidence of Griffiths phase owing to the ferromagnetic clusters. The magnetic hysteresis loops represent the magnetization reversal which, in turn, also indicate the short range magnetic correlations, and reflect the coexistence of hard and soft magnetic phases in Co3Sn2S2. The Arrott plots derived from magnetization reveal convex type curvature at low fields and linear positive behaviour in the high field region, confirming the second order magnetic phase transition in Co3Sn2S2. The Takahashi spin fluctuation theory analysis provides a sufficient evidence for itinerant ferromagnetism in Co3Sn2S2. A large magnetocrystalline anisotropy concomitant with a high anisotropy field suggests the dominance of strong spin orbit coupling phenomenon. Our experimental results emphasize an intuitive understanding of the complex nature of magnetism present in Co-based shandite systems.\nPACS numbers:\nKeywords: shandite; ferromagnetic clusters; Griffiths singularity; susceptibility; hysteresis; anisotropy; itinerant; magnetocrystalline; spin-orbit coupling\nI. INTRODUCTION\nCobalt based sulphides with formula Co3A2S2 (A = Sn and In) are considered representative examples of strongly correlated d-electron systems that have triggered immense interest for their remarkable physical properties [1\u20136]. In particular, the coexistence of half-metallic state and ferromagnetism in shandite-type Co3Sn2S2 makes it promising for spintronics and technological applications [7, 8]. Reported band structure calculations on Co3Sn2S2 reveal predominantly Co 3d-character in addition to Sn 5s and S 3p states. This results in sharp, narrow bands in the vicinity of Fermi level EF leading to the low dimensional character of layered kagome structure [3\u20139]. Co3Sn2S2 attains a ferromagnetic state below TC = 177 K. It is characterized as a type IA half-metallic ferromagnet from photoemission and transport measurements [8\u2013 10]. Furthermore, Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) and Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy (STM) experiments confirm the Weyl semimetal phase in Co3Sn2S2. Consequent phenomena such as anomalous Hall effect, anomalous Nernst effect and magneto-caloric effect have also been reported [11\u201314].\n\u2217 vipin91nagpal@gmail.com \u2020 spatnaik@jnu.ac.in\nSeveral recent works based on Co-based shandite minerals have offered analysis of structural, magnetic and electronic phases, that exhibit spin glass state and metalsemiconductor phase transition owing to the geometric frustration in the kagome arrangement of magnetic Co atoms [15, 16]. These inhomogeneous phases originate from the slow spin dynamics and shifting of the Fermi level to lower occupied energy states below the band gap [16]. Moreover, these phase inhomogeneities in the magnetic materials are associated with formation of ferromagnetic clusters (FMC) embedded in the paramagnetic region [17\u201319]. In other words, the short range FMC occur at a higher temperature TGP far above the long-range magnetic ordering temperature TC, which is primarily ascribed to Griffiths singularity. The region where FMC exists, i.e., between the temperatures TC and TGP, characterizes the Griffiths phase (GP). In GP region, disordered finite size clusters with uncorrelated spins exist and a non-analytic behaviour of magnetization is reported [17, 18]. This phenomenon was first identified in randomly diluted Ising ferromagnets [20]. Such FMC have been observed in complex oxides where identified reasons include quenched chemical or structural disorder, or spin fluctuations [21, 22].\nThe present work primarily focuses on comprehensive investigation of the magnetic properties of shandite Co3Sn2S2.

We also analyse our magnetic data on the basis of Takahashi spin fluctuation theory which explains the physical properties of itinerant ferromagnetic materials in electron correlated systems [23]."

            "text": "Figure 1(a) shows the XRD pattern of the cleaved surface of Co3Sn2S2 single crystal. The 00l peaks in the diffraction pattern suggests the single crystalline nature of the sample with the cleaved surface of crystal being the basal ab plane. The Rietveld refinement analysis of powder XRD pattern of Co3Sn2S2 confirmed the phase purity and the refined lattice parameters were obtained to be a = 5.37 A\u030a and c = 13.17 A\u030a [24]. The shandite structure of Co3Sn2S2 constitutes quasi two-dimensional (2D) sheets of magnetic Co atoms in a hexagonal arrangement forming a kagome-type lattice. These sheets are capped above or below by S atoms, and stacked in an ABC-ABC chain sequence (figures 1(b) and 1(c)). The Sn atoms coordinated between the kagome sheets are coupled to trigonal anti-prismatic interlayer sites generated by triangular layers of adjacent Co atoms. The Co and S atoms occupy the unique lattice sites 9e (1/2,0,0) and 6c (0,0,z) respectively whereas Sn atoms are partially located at two different sites, 3b (0,0,1/2) and 3a (0,0,0).\nThe temperature dependent DC magnetization M(T ) in zero field cooled (ZFC) and field cooled (FC) modes, under an applied magnetic field H = 500 Oe, performed in both out-of-plane (H \u2016 c-axis) and in-plane (H \u2016 ab plane) directions are shown in figures 2(a) and 2(b), respectively. The respective differential of magnetization dM/dT vs. T (inset in figures 2(a) and 2(b)) plots exhibit minima around 177 K, confirming the ferromagnetic (FM) to paramagnetic (PM) phase transition. Interestingly, there is a significant difference observed in\nFIG. 1. (a) XRD pattern of the cleaved surface i.e., (00l) plane of Co3Sn2S2 single crystal.

(c) Hexagonal arrangement of Co atoms.\nM(T ) data below TC in two crystallographic directions implying the anisotropic nature of Co3Sn2S2 [8]. Similar results have also been observed previously in Co3Sn2S2 where the presence of strong magnetic anisotropy was ascribed for this appreciable different behaviours at field parallel to c-axis and ab-plane [10, 14]. Based on earlier discussions on two dimensional layered kagoome ferromagnets [25\u201327], the strong magnetic anisotropy in Co3Sn2S2 is suggested to predominantly originate from the combined effects of various quantum phenomena such as strong spin-orbit coupling [28, 29], crystal electric field [29], exchange couplings [30], and stripe-like features of ferromagnetic domains[31]. Besides, the difference in magnetic behaviour along the two field directions can also possibly be associated with the presence of large magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy caused by the intrinsic strong spin-orbit coupling [28]. In general, the anisotropic behaviour in a magnetic material is believed to originate from the intrinsic atomic magnetic moments associated with magnetocrystalline anisotropy [31]. As a consequence of magnetocrystalline anisotropy, the anisotropy in magnetization is observed in our measurement data [32].\nFurthermore, the FC-ZFC curves in both the directions show a bifurcation below the critical temperature TC. In general, this can be ascribed to magnetic anisotropy, formation of FM clusters, spin frustrations or pinning of the ferromagnetic domain walls [33\u201337]. It is clearly seen that the bifurcation onsets at higher temperature T \u2217 \u223c 176 K in H \u2016 ab direction (figure 2(b) main panel) as compared to T \u2217 \u223c 134K in H \u2016 c direction (figure 2(a) lower inset). This, in turn, implies that the compound is\n3\nhighly anisotropic where the spins get locked in random directions, resulting in decrease in magnetization at low temperatures [38]. In H \u2016 ab direction, a peak is also detected at TG \u223c 133 K in ZFC curve marked by an arrow in the lower inset of figure 2(b). This is an indication of frozen spin states depicting the low temperature glassy transition [16]. These features such as FC-ZFC bifurcation and peak in ZFC curve are typical characteristics of spin glass state [39\u201341]. Such scenario has also been reported in systems involving cluster glasses [40], superparamagnets [42], and superconducting oxides [43].\nNext, we discuss the magnetic behaviour of Co3Sn2S2 using the temperature dependent susceptibility \u03c7(= M/H) as derived from the magnetization measurements. It is quite familiar that the susceptibility as a function of\ntemperature in the PM region follows Curie-Weiss (CW) law: \u03c7 = C/(T \u2212 \u03b8P), where \u03b8P is the Weiss temperature and C is the Curie constant. The effective magnetic moment \u00b5eff is calculated from the Curie constant using the expression:\n\u00b5eff =\n\u221a 3kBC\nNA (1)\nwhere kB is the Boltzmann constant and NA is the Avogadro number.\nFigures 2(c) and 2(d) illustrate the inverse of magnetic susceptibility \u03c7\u22121 as a function of temperature in the applied magnetic field 500 Oe in H \u2016 c and H \u2016 ab directions, respectively. The plots of \u03c7\u22121 vs. T above\n4 the magnetic transition TC exhibit a strong curvilinear behaviour in both directions. In addition, the distinct behaviour in inverse magnetic susceptibility data is observed along the two directions that is likely due to the strong magnetocrystalline anisotropy where \u03c7\u22121 data along c-axis is four times larger than that in ab-plane [31, 32]. An unusual divergence in the PM region from CW linear behaviour is observed above TC in the H \u2016 c direction. In contrast, a non-linear concave curvature is observed in H \u2016 ab direction above TC that continues upto room temperature. Consequently, a sharp downturn is detected in both the directions as the temperature is decreased to TC from the paramagnetic state. This non-analytic behaviour of magnetization is indicative of the emergence of short-range FM clusters before the long range FM ordered state sets below TC [17, 18]. It is suggested that the deviation from linear CW behaviour in such plots is a consequence of exchange splitting between Co-3d orbital states due to the spin-orbit coupling [44]. Other factors including phase inhomogeneity, quenched disorder and spin fluctuations have also been discussed [21, 22]. Moreover, the downturn in inverse susceptibilities is considered to be a characteristic signature of Griffiths phase, which is different from a smeared phase transition that gives rise to an upward deviation in \u03c7\u22121 in the PM state [20]. Similar features in inverse susceptibility have been reported in semiconducting ferromagnet La1\u2212xSr1+xCoO4 (0 6 x 6 1), half doped manganite Pr0.5Sr0.5MnO3, and La-based manganites [21, 22, 45]. The plot of \u03c7\u22121 vs. T for H \u2016 c direction above 265 K is found to be perfectly in agreement with CW fit-\nting, (figure 2(c)). The slope and intercept parameters of linear CW fitting give the calculated C and \u03b8P, respectively. In contrast, the \u03c7\u22121 vs. T plot in H \u2016 ab above TC does not follow the conventional linear CW law and hence, the concave curvature, (figure 2(d)), is fitted with a modified Curie-Weiss equation: \u03c7 = \u03c70 + C/(T \u2212 \u03b8P) where \u03c70 is the temperature independent factor arising from Pauli paramagnetic and diamagnetic contributions [44, 46]. Using the fitted curves, the obtained values of \u03b8P in both the cases are positive, and found to be 215 K and 173 K respectively, validating the dominance of ferromagnetic interactions among the spins. Similar results of \u03b8P values determined away from TC were also reported in perovskite and mixed valence manganites [47, 48]. In general, the difference in the values of \u03b8P and TC i.e, \u03b8P > TC or \u03b8P < TC purely depends on the inhomogeneous phase present in the substance, which in turn is linked to the presence of short-range magnetic correlations just above TC [49]. In H \u2016 c direction, \u00b5eff is determined to be 2.77\u00b5B from Eq. (1). The obtained \u00b5eff is intermediate between the theoretically calculated (spin-only) low-spin state (1.73\u00b5B) and high-spin state (3.87\u00b5B) values of Co\n2+ ions [50]. On the other hand, the experimental value of \u00b5eff for H \u2016 ab direction is 6.63\u00b5B using the modified Curie-Weiss fit.The difference in the results of experimental and theoretical values of \u00b5eff in both the directions supports the development of\nFIG. 3. The variation of memory effect with temperature in (a) FC and (b) ZFC modes under the applied magnetic field H = 100Oe. The processes are interrupted for the period of two hours each at T1 = 80 K and T2 = 50 K in FC mode and T1 = 20 K in ZFC mode. Inset in (b) shows the difference \u2206M = M refZFCW \u2212MmemZFCW as the function of temperature in ZFC mode.\nshort range FM clusters near TC [51]. Further, the high value of \u00b5eff means a contribution of both orbital and spin components to the magnetic moment due to the large splitting of orbital levels relative to thermal energy (kBT ) [52]. This high \u00b5eff value further confirms the FM correlations present in the PM regime.\nIn order to ascertain the nature of low temperature glassy state in Co3Sn2S2, the memory effect measurements were carried out in both FC and ZFC modes in H \u2016 c direction as shown in figures 3(a) and 3(b), respectively [53, 54]. Firstly, the sample was treated under FC mode while cooling from room temperature to 5 K in the presence of 100 Oe applied magnetic field. The FC process was interrupted for a duration of 2 hours each at T1 = 80 K and T2 = 50 K below the glassy transition TG where the magnetic field was turned off allowing the system to acquire a relaxed state. At each temperatures after the waiting period was completed, the same magnetic field was turned on and the cooling process was\n5 resumed. The magnetization data recorded using this process is referred to as M stopFC which shows step-like behaviours at the interrupted temperatures 80 K and 50 K. After cooling down to 5 K, the sample was heated up to 300 K under the same magnetic field without any interruption and the obtained magnetization curve is denoted as MmemFCW. It is interesting to note that M mem FCW curve also exhibits the characteristic dips at each halt temperatures performed in M stopFC , thus following the previous M(T ) data. Hence, this feature clear indicates the magnetic memory effect in our sample. Again, the FC magnetization M refFCW is taken for reference in the same field without any interruption. Similarly, the memory effect measurement was also performed in ZFC condition along the same direction in which the sample was cooled down from room temperature to 5 K in the absence of magnetic field. The ZFC process was interrupted at T1 = 20 K for two hours duration where the magnetic field was turned off. As soon as the temperature reaches 2 K, a 100 Oe magnetic field was applied and the magnetization data was measured while warming the sample which is referred to as MmemZFCW. Again, the sample is cooled down to 2 K in zero magnetic field without any interruption and the magnetization data was recorded while warming the sample in the applied magnetic field of 100 Oe which is denoted as M refZFCW. It is clearly noted the M mem ZFCW and M refZFCW curves coincides each other except around 20 K. Clearly, a difference in i.e., a memory dip at 22 K close to interrupted temperature is observed as a result of the difference between MmemZFCW and M ref ZFCW curves i.e., \u2206M = M refZFCW \u2212MmemZFCW as shown in the inset of figure 3(b). Since the ZFC memory effect is observed only in glassy magnetic systems and not in superparamagnetic systems even if both exhibit FC memory effect, one can explicitly rule out the condition of superparamagnetism for the observation of FC and ZFC memory effect [55]. Hence, we strongly conclude from memory effect results that the origin of glass-like features at low temperatures is due to the presence of ferromagnetic clusters of spins present in this system [53].\nAs stated earlier, the curved downturn in the reciprocal magnetic susceptibility above the FM phase transition is a typical feature of Griffiths phase characterised by the appearance of finite-size FM clusters with the spin correlations in the PM matrix [17, 18]. The GP phase is a clustered state that possess local spin interactions in the PM region. In this GP region, the spins are ferromagnetically correlated within the clusters and the system is expected to exist in neither long range FM ordered state nor pure PM state. As a consequence, no spontaneous magnetization would appear in this GP region and hence, magnetization shows non-analytic behaviour. This observation arises from the Griffiths singularity which causes the susceptibility deviation from CW behaviour [20]. Based on the theoretical models, the divergence in susceptibility in Griffiths phase leads to a power-law behaviour expressed as [22, 56]:\n\u03c7\u22121 \u221d (T \u2212 TRC )1\u2212\u03bb (2)\nFIG. 4. (a) Plot of log(\u03c7\u22121) vs. log(T/TRC \u2212 1) for H \u2016 c direction according to Eq. (1). The red solid line is the linear fitting to the derived data. (b) The normalized magnetization M(t)/M(0) with the evolution of time at 190 K and 250 K fitted with an equation: M(t) \u223c exp(\u2212at\u03b2) (red solid curve). (c) Temperature dependence of magnetization measured in the low temperature range (2-100 K) for both H \u2016 c and H \u2016 ab directions. The black solid line is the fit according to equation: M(T ) = M(0)[1 \u2212 ASWT 3/2]. The red solid line is the fit according to equation: M(T ) = M(0)[1\u2212BSET 2]. The yellow line is the fit for the equation: M(T ) = M(0)[1\u2212ASWT 3/2 \u2212BSET 2].\n6 Here, TRC refers to the critical temperature of random FM at which susceptibility tend to diverge and the exponent \u03bb(0 < \u03bb 6 1) characterises the Griffiths singularity which signifies the deviation from CW behaviour. The powerlaw relation in Eq. (2) is a modified form of CW law. The value of exponent \u03bb tends to be zero in the pure PM region. So, it is understood that the high value of \u03bb implies strong deviation from CW behaviour.\nIn order to calculate the strength of deviation from CW law, the magnetic susceptibility is plotted as \u03c7\u22121 vs. (T/TRC \u22121) at 500 Oe on log-log scale for H \u2016 c direction (figure 4(a)). The slopes obtained from linear fitting in the GP regime and PM region give the respective values of exponents \u03bbGP and \u03bbPM. It is discussed that the proper value of \u03bb must be determined from an accurate TRC , otherwise an improper T R C in Eq. (2) would lead to unphysical fitting and erroneous determination of \u03bb. To estimate the correct TRC , we have followed a method which initially fixes TRC equal to TC and \u03bbPM is evaluated from the fitted plot. Then, the value of TRC is adjusted such that \u03bbPM comes close to zero in the PM state. It follows the fact that GP gets transformed to usual PM region above the Griffiths temperature TGP and \u03c7\n\u22121 obeys the CW law. Here, TGP is evaluated from the starting point of downturn in \u03c7\u22121. Using this method, the respective TRC and TGP values are found to be 216 K and 265 K. Further, the slopes from the linear fitting in figure 4(a) gives \u03bbPM = 0.003 and \u03bbGP = 0.967. Therefore, we confirmed that a very large value of \u03bbGP reflects the remarkably strong Griffiths singularity in this material.\nThe existence of Griffiths singularity is commonly characterised by the slow dynamics of spins [57]. It is expected that the spin relaxation is slower due to the short range FM clusters in GP phase rather than that in PM regime. Therefore, in order to provide more evidence of the presence of short-range FM clusters, the isothermal remanent magnetization measurements were performed to study the spin relaxation behaviour in the GP phase below TGP. The magnetization M(t) was recorded with the evolution of time in the presence of 500 Oe magnetic field at 190 K and 250 K in the GP regime. Initially, the sample in zero magnetic field was cooled upto the desired temperature and then, the magnetization was scanned upto 3600 s after applying the magnetic field. Figure 4(b) shows the normalized magnetization M(t)/M(0) as a function of time exhibiting the slow spin dynamics where M(0) is the magnetization at t = 0. It implies the spin relaxation behaviour and the magnetization is observed to follow the exponential form: M(t) \u223c exp(\u2212at\u03b2); (0 < \u03b2 < 1). Using the exponential fit, \u03b2 \u223c 0.42 is determined below TGP [58]. Hence, such slow relaxation behaviour at 190 K and 250 K below TGP is due to the presence of the ferromagnetic clusters of uncorrelated spins [58, 59].\nNext, we discuss the low temperature thermal effects of magnetization in both the directions. It is ascertained that the low temperature magnetization in some ferromagnets commonly decreases with the increase in tem-\nperature due to thermally excited magnons and Stoner excitations [60]. The magnons follow Bloch T 3/2 law unlike the T 2 dependence for Stoner excitations. Following this approximation, the measured FC magnetization in the low temperature region in H \u2016 c and H \u2016 ab directions are shown in figure 4(c). The magnetization data is fitted to (i) Bloch law: M(T ) = M(0)[1\u2212ASWT 3/2], (ii) the Stoner excitation term: M(T ) = M(0)[1 \u2212 BSET 2], and (iii) combination of Bloch and Stoner excitation terms: M(T ) = M(0)[1\u2212ASWT 3/2\u2212BSET 2]. Here M(0) is the magnetization at 0 K. ASW and BSE are spin-wave and Stoner-excitation parameters, respectively. It is observed that the low temperature magnetization for both the directions is also separately well fitted with the Bloch function as well as the Stoner excitation term. Considering the combined fit according to (iii), the values of M(0) are calculated as 3.6\u00d7103 emu/mole and 0.14\u00d7103 emu/mole for H \u2016 c and H \u2016 ab directions, respectively. Also, the parameters ASW, BSE are found to be 5.89\u00d710\u22125K\u22123/2, 4.56\u00d710\u22126K\u22122 and 2.59\u00d710\u22125K\u22123/2, 2.01 \u00d7 10\u22126K\u22122 for H \u2016 c and H \u2016 ab orientations, respectively. It is noted that the values of BSE are found smaller in comparison to ASW in both the directions which implies that the Stoner excitations are suppressed by the dominant spin wave excitations [61]. Using the fitted spin wave parameter ASW, the exchange interaction Jex is evaluated between two Co\n2+ neighbouring ions from the expression: ASW = (0.0587/S)(2JexS)\n3/2, where S = 3/2 is the total spin of Co2+ ions in the high spin state. The values of Jex are found to be 25.38 kBK and 43.89 kBK respectively for H \u2016 c and H \u2016 ab directions. The difference in the values of exchange interaction in both the directions is due to the change in interatomic distance between neighbouring Co2+ ions in two orientations. We next examine the magnetic behaviour near the critical temperature region in Co3Sn2S2 by employing Kouvel-Fisher (KF) method where the spontaneous magnetization MS and inverse susceptibility \u03c7 \u22121 0 are evaluated using equations (3) and (4) [62]. The KF method is often chosen to be more accurate compared to other methods for determining TC and the critical exponents (\u03b2, \u03b3) in magnetic systems [63, 64]. The critical exponents are the characteristic magnetic parameters near the magnetic phase transition which specifies the nature of magnetic ordering and interactions involved in the system.\nMS(T )\ndMS(T )/dT = (T \u2212 TC) \u03b2\n(3)\n\u03c7\u221210 (T )\nd\u03c7\u221210 (T )/dT =\n(T \u2212 TC) \u03b3\n(4)\nFigures 5(a) and 5(b) show the KF plots of both MS(T )/(dMS(T )/dT ) vs. T and \u03c7 \u22121 0 (T )/(d\u03c7 \u22121 0 (T )/dT ) vs. T for the directions H \u2016 c and H \u2016 ab, respectively. In accordance to KF method, the KF plots described by\n7\n8\nEquations (3) and (4) are exactly linear whose respective slopes would yield 1/\u03b2 and 1/\u03b3. In addition, TC is determined from the intercept of the plots. Clear linear behaviour is observed in KF plots (figures 5(a) and 5(b)) in both the directions. The derived values of TC and critical exponents are listed in Table I. It is found that the exponents \u03b2 = 0.307 and \u03b3 = 1.15 in H \u2016 c direction are slightly less than the previous reports on Co3Sn2S2 [65]. Here, the experimental values are approximately close to the predicted theoretical value for three dimensional (3D) Ising model (\u03b2 = 0.324, \u03b3 = 1.241), which further indicates a 3D Ising type ferromagnetism in Co3Sn2S2. The difference in critical exponents along the two directions reflect the high anisotropy of the material. Furthermore, several factors including different magnetic domain structures, magnetic orientation or strain field effect could lead to the difference in the values obtained for two different crystallographic directions [66].\nFigures 6(a) and 6(b) show the magnetization M(H) as a function of magnetic field under the sweeping field from -20 kOe to +20 kOe taken at 5 K along H \u2016 c and H \u2016 ab directions, respectively. Initially, the M \u2212H curves exhibit increase in magnetization at low magnetic fields and a pronounced hysteresis is also observed in both the directions. The inset in figures 6(a) and 6(b) depicts the enlarged image of M \u2212 H hysteresis loop at small magnetic fields. Similar hysteresis in two crystallographic directions have been reported earlier in Co3Sn2S2 [10, 14]. However, the magnetization saturates with the increase in magnetic field in H \u2016 c direction while it increases linearly with no signs of saturation in H \u2016 ab direction. The different hysteresis in two directions indicates the strong magnetic anisotropy i.e., large magnetocrystalline anisotropy present in our sample. Since the moments are saturated in c-axis direction, it is confirmed that the c-axis is the preferred easy axis of magnetization whereas the linear increase in isothermal magnetization along basal plane indicates that the hard axis of magnetization is along the ab-plane [67]. The magnetic moments in H \u2016 ab quickly reach the value around 0.3\u00b5B/f.u. at low fields and thereafter, increase slowly in a linear fashion upto the highest applied magnetic field of 20 kOe. In other words, M \u2212 H curves in two directions exhibit a hysteresis switch from low field steep change to high field\ngradual change of the magnetization. This crossover is further accredited to magnetization reversal, which implies the presence of short range Co-Co magnetic interactions [68, 69]. In order to acquire more insight into the hysteresis behaviour, the function in Eq. (5) is fitted to experimentally measured hysteresis loop in H \u2016 c and H \u2016 ab directions at 5 K (figures 6(c) and 6(d)) [68, 70].\nM(H) = \u221e\u2211 i=1 2MS \u03c0 tan\u22121 | (H \u00b1HC) HC tan( \u03c0S 2 ) | (5)\nwhere MS and HC are the saturation magnetization and coercivity, respectively. Here, the fitted parameter S represents the ratio of remanent magnetization MR and saturation magnetization i.e., S = MR/MS. It is noted that the above function nicely fits to the measured data in both the directions. The fitted parameters obtained from the fitting function are listed in Table II.\nIt is mentioned that the low coercivity has been observed in H \u2016 ab direction as compared to H \u2016 c di-\n9 rection. Moreover, the smaller MR/MS ratio in H \u2016 ab direction in contrast to H \u2016 c direction suggests the enhanced disoriented ferromagnetic domains [71]. Clearly as evident from the figures, the hysteresis loop observed along H \u2016 c direction (figure 6(a) inset) reflects the hard magnetic phase revealing high coercivity and magnetic saturation. On the other hand, the hysteresis loop in H \u2016 ab direction shown in the inset of figure 6(b) depicts the soft magnetic phase that exhibits a low coercive field without any saturation at higher applied magnetic fields. It is inferred that the magnetic saturation in hard magnetic phase arises due to contribution of FM phase whereas the soft magnetic phase (where no saturation is observed) arises due to the competition between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions. Next, we present the Arrott plots (M2 vs. H/M) at 5 K for H \u2016 c and H \u2016 ab directions in figures 7(a) and 7(b), respectively. It is noticed that the curves exhibit a high field or linear behaviour with a strong downward curvature at very low magnetic fields (insets of figures 7(a) and 7(b)). Similar convex behaviour in M2 is reported in typical itinerant ferromagnetic materials such as MnSi [23] and transition metal oxide Sr1.5Nd0.5MnO4 [72]. According to Banerjee\u2019s criterion, the convex downward curvature observed along the two directions resembles a second order phase transition [73]. It is also noteworthy here that the linear positive slope in Arrott plot indicates a second order FM to PM phase transition in Co3Sn2S2.\nTo get further deeper insights into the presence of FM clusters, the isothermal magnetization curves over the temperature range above and below TC under the sweeping magnetic field of 20 kOe in H \u2016 c are depicted in figure 8(a). The M \u2212H curves at different temperatures exhibit a non-linear behaviour as depicted in the inset of figure 8(a) implying that the magnetic state above TC and below TGP is not a pure PM state and validates the GP owing to the presence of short range FM clusters [74]. Moreover, the isothermal magnetization data for temperatures above TC are also analysed using the Arrott plot as shown in figure 8(b). The inset in figure 8(b) presents the zoomed part of Arrott plot analysed in the temperature range (TC < T < TGP) upto \u00b110 kOe. It is clearly observed that the linear extrapolation of Arrott plot curves on M2 axis yields no spontaneous magnetization Msp at all temperatures above TC. The zero Msp obtained between TC and TGP again confirms that\nthe magnetic state above TC is GP and not a pure PM state, and hence validates the presence of FM clusters in Co3Sn2S2 [22].\nThe characteristic feature of non-linearity and convex curvature in the Arrott plot (figures )at extremely low fields is explained by means of Takahashi spin fluctuation theory [23]. In Takahashi spin fluctuation theory, the magnetization at the phase transition is given by the following expression [23, 75, 76]:\nH = F1\nN30 (g\u00b5B) 4 \u00d7 (\u2212M20 +M2) (6)\nwhere H is the magnetic field, N0 is the Avogadro number, g is the Lande g-factor, F1 is the mode-mode coupling term and M0 is the spontaneous magnetization. F1 can be estimated experimentally at low temperatures from the slope of Arrott plots (M2 vs. H/M) using Eq. (7)[77]:\nF1 = N30 (2\u00b5B) 4\nkB\u03b6 (7)\nwhere \u00b5B is the Boltzmann constant and \u03b6 is the slope of Arrott plot curve at a desired temperature. The spin fluctuation parameters T0 and TA indicate the distribution widths in the energy and wave-vector spaces, respectively. These parameters are related to F1 by the following equations:\n( TC T0 )5/6 = p2s 5g2C4/3 ( 15cF1 2TC )1/2 (8)\n( TC TA )5/3 = p2s 5g2C4/3 ( 2TC 15cF1 )1/2 (9)\nwhere C4/3 = 1.00608 and ps are the spontaneous magnetic moment. Takahashi theory ensures that the spin fluctuation parameters can be estimated from measured magnetic data only. The fraction TC/T0 in the spin fluctuation theory specifies the degree of itinerant character of magnetic atoms with a strong itinerant feature achieved at TC T0. Besides, TC/T0 is related to the Rhodes-Wohlfarth ratio pc/ps in Takahashi theory, stating the large pc/ps and small TC/T0 indicative of weak\nferromagnetism. Here, pc = \u221a\n(1 + p2eff) \u2212 1 is the magnetic moment, in units of \u00b5B, in the paramagnetic phase and peff is the effective magnetic moment calculated from Curie-Weiss law. Such itinerant ferromagnetism principally arises from the screening effect of electrons in the band structure due to electron-electron correlations and exchange interactions [72].It is pertinent to note that the factors pc/ps and TC/T0 are the important parameters for characterising the degree of itinerancy of electrons [78].Now using the linearly fitted slope \u03b6 and intercept values in the Arrott plot of M2 vs. H/M in figures 7(a) and 7(b), we can estimate the parameters coupling term F1 and the spontaneous magnetic moment ps, respectively. The derived values of F1, ps and peff for both the\n10\ndirections are listed in the Table III. The spin fluctuation parameters TA and T0 are evaluated from ps, F1 and TC values using the relations given in equations (8) and (9), respectively are also listed in the Table III. The ratios pc/ps and TC/T0 have been estimated and also listed in the Table III. As observed, the factor pc/ps is found reasonably large (i.e, pc/ps > 1) in both the directions. Moreover, TC/T0 is determined to be very small i.e., less than unity. Therefore, a large pc/ps and small TC/T0 values found along the two directions clearly imply the itinerant nature of ferromagnetism in Co3Sn2S2. The discrepancy in the two ratios in the directons again indicates the anisotropy present in Co3Sn2S2. It is found that the respective values of TC/T0 in H \u2016 c and H \u2016 ab directions are approximately 0.24 and 0.022, which means a strong itinerant character of Co3Sn2S2 [79].\nFigure 9 shows the M \u2212H curve fitted with Brillouin function given in Eq. (10) at 5 K for H \u2016 c and H \u2016 ab directions. In general, the magnetization of a FM system can be defined by the Brillouin function [80].\nM(x) = NgS\u00b5B[ 2S + 1\n2S coth(\n2S + 1 2S )x\u2212 1 2S coth( x 2S )]\n(10)\nwhere x = gS\u00b5BHkBT is the ratio of Zeeman energy of the magnetic moment in molecular field thermal energy, g is the Lande g-factor value and N is the number of spins. The lower and higher spin state values of Co2+ ions i.e., S = 1/2 and S = 3/2 are taken into account for the analysis using Brillouin function. It is noted for both the values of S, the function fit well at low and high magnetic fields in the two directions.\nThe magnetic field dependent magnetization data taken at 1.7 K is further analysed to extract the information about magneto-crystalline anisotropy in Co3Sn2S2. The magnetocrystalline anisotropy is related to the\nground state energy required to orient the magnetization vector from easy magnetic axis to other random directions. The effective magnetocrystalline anisotropy constant Keff is determined from the relation: Keff = MSHa/2. The parameter Ha is the anisotropy field defined as that particular magnetic field where the extrapolated lines of magnetization curves from the out-of plane and in-plane directions intersect [67]. It is clearly shown by a pointed arrow in figure 10 that the linear extrapolation of M \u2212 H curve along ab-plane reaches the saturation magnetization in c-axis direction at a magnetic field Ha \u223c 185 kOe. Hence, the magnitude of anisotropy constant Keff is evaluated to be about 9.24\n11\nTABLE III.

Further, the obtained Keff value is found to be quite larger than the values reported in other known kagome ferromagnetic materials such as CrI3 [81], Fe3GeTe2 [82] and Fe3Sn2 [83]. It is understood that the large magnetocrystalline anisotropy is accompanied by high anisotropy field. Thus, in Co-based compounds, strong magneto-crystalline anisotropy in magnetization is predominantly due to the large orbital magnetic moments concomitant with Co atoms coupled with the crystal electric field effects in the crystal structure [84, 85]. Such large magnetocrystalline anisotropy originates from strong spin-orbit coupling effect at the lattice\nsites in Co3Sn2S2 [28]."

            "text": "In conclusion, we have demonstrated the evidence of ferromagnetic short-range clusters in the paramagnetic region along with low temperature cluster-glassy phase in highly anisotropic kagome compound Co3Sn2S2. The presence of short range ferromagnetic clusters is demonstrated by a sharp downturn in the paramagnetic region in the inverse magnetic susceptibility data above TC, showing a clear deviation from linear Curie-Weiss behaviour. This feature is a characteristic signature of pronounced Griffiths phase in Co3Sn2S2. In addition, a strong Griffiths singularity is observed at the temperature around 265 K followed by the slow magnetic relaxation behaviour and no net spontaneous magnetization above TC in the Griffiths phase. The crossover, from low field steep increase to high field gradual change of magnetization, observed in magnetic hysteresis further corroborates the short range magnetic interactions present in the system. The itinerant ferromagnetism in Co3Sn2S2 is confirmed from Arrott plots as established on the basis of Takahashi theory of spin fluctuations. A large magnetocrystalline anisotropy is found which is related to the high anisotropy field, suggesting the role of strong spinorbit coupling in Co3Sn2S2."
