    "abstractText": "We studied the mechanical leaflet coupling of prototypic mammalian plasma membranes using neutron spin-echo spectroscopy. In particular, we examined a series of asymmetric phospholipid vesicles with phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin enriched in the outer leaflet and inner leaflets composed of phosphatidylethanolamine / phosphatidylserine mixtures. The bending rigidities of most asymmetric membranes were anomalously high, exceeding even those of symmetric membranes formed from their cognate leaflets. Only asymmetric vesicles with outer leaflets enriched in sphingolipid displayed bending rigidities in conformity with these symmetric controls. We performed complementary small-angle neutron and X-ray experiments on the same vesicles to examine possible links to structural coupling mechanisms, which would show up in corresponding changes in membrane thickness. Additionally, we estimated differential stress between leaflets originating either from a mismatch of their lateral areas or spontaneous curvatures. However, no correlation with asymmetry-induced membrane stiffening was observed. To reconcile our findings, we speculate that an asymmetric distribution charged or H-bond forming lipids may induce an intraleaflet coupling which increases the weight of hard undulatory modes of membrane fluctuations and hence the overall membrane stiffness. SIGNIFICANCE Biological membranes not only act as the outer barriers of cells and organelles, but host a delicate machinery of proteins, which is sensitive not only to the surrounding lipid composition, but also to the mechanical properties of the bilayer. Little is known about the effect of transbilayer lipid asymmetry, a hallmark of all plasma membranes, on bilayer structure and dynamics. The results of this study indicate that the composition of the plasma membrane leads to unique mechanical coupling mechanisms, suggesting that the regulation of lipid asymmetry through flipases/flopases and scramblases could be an important means to tune the mechanical stiffness of the membrane. INTRODUCTION Cellular envelopes contain a large number of lipid species that are distributed asymmetrically between the two leaflets of the bilayer. For example, mammalian plasma membranes are known to be composed of an outer leaflet enriched in cholinephospholipids, while the majority of the aminophospholipids are confined to the inner leaflet (1, 2). Membrane asymmetry is generated and maintained by an array of enzymes termed flipases, flopases, and scramblases (3). However, the physiological need or benefits for membrane asymmetry are far from being understood. For example, the different chemical potentials stored in both leaflets might induce a coupling that can be exploited, e.g. in signaling or transport processes such as endo/exocytosis even in the absence of protein (4, 5). Currently conceived lipid-mediated coupling mechanisms consider either intrinsic lipid curvature, headgroup electrostatics, cholesterol flip-flop, dynamic chain interdigitation, and differential stress between lipid leaflets (6\u20138). Transleaflet coupling has been reported to induce domains in non-domain forming lipid mixtures (9, 10), affect lateral lipid diffusion (11), or cross-link the melting transitions of individual leaflets (7). Recently, we reported that the extent of hydrocarbon interdigitation allows to tweak the lateral packing of lipids in the apposing leaflet through competing cohesive and entropic Manuscript submitted to Biophysical Journal 1 .

            "text": "SIGNIFICANCE Biological membranes not only act as the outer barriers of cells and organelles, but host a delicate machinery of proteins, which is sensitive not only to the surrounding lipid composition, but also to the mechanical properties of the bilayer. Little is known about the effect of transbilayer lipid asymmetry, a hallmark of all plasma membranes, on bilayer structure and dynamics. The results of this study indicate that the composition of the plasma membrane leads to unique mechanical coupling mechanisms, suggesting that the regulation of lipid asymmetry through flipases/flopases and scramblases could be an important means to tune the mechanical stiffness of the membrane."

            "text": "Cellular envelopes contain a large number of lipid species that are distributed asymmetrically between the two leaflets of the bilayer. For example, mammalian plasma membranes are known to be composed of an outer leaflet enriched in cholinephospholipids, while the majority of the aminophospholipids are confined to the inner leaflet (1, 2). Membrane asymmetry is generated and maintained by an array of enzymes termed flipases, flopases, and scramblases (3). However, the physiological need or benefits for membrane asymmetry are far from being understood. For example, the different chemical potentials stored in both leaflets might induce a coupling that can be exploited, e.g. in signaling or transport processes such as endo/exocytosis even in the absence of protein (4, 5). Currently conceived lipid-mediated coupling mechanisms consider either intrinsic lipid curvature, headgroup electrostatics, cholesterol flip-flop, dynamic chain interdigitation, and differential stress between lipid leaflets (6\u20138).\nTransleaflet coupling has been reported to induce domains in non-domain forming lipid mixtures (9, 10), affect lateral lipid diffusion (11), or cross-link the melting transitions of individual leaflets (7). Recently, we reported that the extent of hydrocarbon interdigitation allows to tweak the lateral packing of lipids in the apposing leaflet through competing cohesive and entropic\nManuscript submitted to Biophysical Journal 1\nFrewein et al.\ninteractions of the acyl chains (12). Additionally, membrane asymmetry can lead to distinct effects on its elastic behavior, either due to lipid specific properties (e.g. size, shape), or simply lipid over/under-crowding of a given leaflet (8, 13). Reported experimental data for membrane asymmetry-induced stiffening agree at least qualitatively with this theory but are scarce (14\u201317). In particular, none of the previous reports interrogated the effect of asymmetrically distributed charged lipids on the bilayer\u2019s bending rigidity. Note that charged lipids are able to increase the stiffness of symmetric bilayers significantly (18, 19).\nThis prompted us to perform bending rigidity measurements on asymmetric membranes with \u2014 compared to previous reports \u2014 higher compositional complexity. In particular, we engineered mimics of mammalian plasma membranes with lipid architectures close to the reported distributions of phosphatidylcholine, sphingomyelin, phosphatidylethanolamine and phosphatidylserine in mammalian plasma membranes (2). Asymmetric large unilamellar vesicles (aLUVs) were produced using cylcodextrin-mediated lipid exchange (20) and studied by small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering (SANS, SAXS) and neutron spin-echo spectroscopy (NSE). Cholesterol was deliberately excluded from the present study, despite its abundance in mammalian plasma membranes. Cholesterol is known to induce lipid domains in lipid mixtures mimicking mammalian membranes (9, 10), which challenges nanostructural interpretation as attempted in this report. Leaving out cholesterol thus allowed us to probe pure phospholipid interactions without any interference from heterogeneities (domains) induced by cholesterol-lipid interactions.\nWe find that aLUVs with inner leaflets enriched either in palmitoyl oleoyl phosphatidylethanolamine (POPE), or POPE/phosphatidylserine (POPS) and outer leaflets containing palmitoyl oleoyl phosphatidylcholine (POPC), milk sphingomyelin (MSM), or equimolar mixtures of both lipids are always more rigid than symmetric vesicles of the same lipid composition. Moreover, most aLUVs were even more rigid than symmetric vesicles of their cognate leaflets, i.e. displayed anomalous stiffening. No anomalous stiffening was observed when only MSM was enriched in the outer leaflet, which can, due to its highly asymmetric hydrocarbon chain composition, interdigitate into the inner leaflet (12). Nanostructural data of the same samples allowed us to seek agreement with existing theories which couple membrane thickness (21) and differential stress (8) to the elastic behaviour of membranes. However, we could not find a satisfactory agreement. We speculate that charge and hydrogen bonding mediated intraleaflet interactions between aminophospholipids lead to a dominance of short wavelength fluctuations (hard modes), when these lipids are distributed asymmetrically in bilayers and hence to much increased bending rigidities. The absence of anomalous stiffening for MSM containing asymmetric membranes suggests that hydrocarbon chain interdigitation can alleviate this effect."

Chloroform, methanol (pro analysis grade), sucrose and methyl-\ud835\udefd-cyclodextrin (m\ud835\udefdCD) were obtained from Merck KGaA, Darmstadt, Germany. We prepared asymmetric unilamellar vesicles following the heavy donor cyclodextrin exchange protocol (20). Acceptor and donor lipids were weighed (ratio 1:2 mol/mol), dissolved separately in a chloroform/methanol mixture (2:1, vol/vol) and dried under a soft argon stream in a glass vial. Acceptor vesicles were prepared from either DPPC with 5 mol% DPPG, POPE with 10 mol% POPG, or POPE with 30 mol% POPS. Donor vesicles consisted of ESM, MSM, POPC or equimolar POPC:MSM mixtures and did not contain any charged lipid.\nThe resulting dry lipid films were kept over night in vacuum to ensure the evaporation of all solvent and subsequently hydrated. Acceptor vesicles were prepared in ultrapure H2O containing 25 mM NaCl (lipid concentration: 10 mg/ml) by 1 h incubation at 50 \u25e6C with intermittent vortex mixing and 5 freeze/thaw cycles. Donor vesicles were hydrated analogously, but in a 20 wt% sucrose solution (lipid concentration: 20 mg/ml). Acceptor vesicles were extruded at 50 \u25e6C using a handheld mini extruder (Avanti Polar Lipids, AL, USA) with a 100 nm pore diameter polycarbonate filter 31 times or until reaching a polydispersity index < 10%. The latter parameter was monitored by dynamic light scattering (DLS) using a Zetasizer NANO ZS90, (Malvern Panalytical, Malvern, UK) ensuring the presence of exclusively large unilamellar vesicles (LUVs). Multilamellar vesicles (MLVs) of donor lipids were diluted 20-fold with water and centrifuged at 20 000 g for 30 min. The supernatant was discarded. The resulting pellet was suspended in a 35 mM m\ud835\udefdCD solution (lipid:m\ud835\udefdCD 1:8 mol/mol) and incubated for 2 h at 50 \u25e6C, while being shaken at a frequency of 600 min\u22121. Acceptor vesicles were added and incubated for another 15 min. The exchange was stopped by diluting the mixture 8-fold with water and centrifuging at 20 000 g for 30 min. The supernatant containing the asymmetric vesicles was then concentrated to < 500 \ud835\udf07l using 15 ml-Amicon centrifuge filters (Merck, 100 kDa cut-off) at 5000 g. To remove residual m\ud835\udefdCD and sucrose, and to exchange H2O by D2O, filters were filled with D2O and re-concentrated in 3 cycles. The final vesicle sizes were again measured by DLS to ensure the absence of donor MLVs.\n2 Manuscript submitted to Biophysical Journal\nAminophospholipids Stiffen Membranes\nScrambled LUVs were produced by drying asymmetric vesicles in a rotary evaporator at 30 \u25e6C and pressures around 50 Pa.

Inner leaflet reference LUVs contained 90 mol% acceptor lipid and 10 mol% donor lipid, while outer leaflet reference LUVs were mixtures of 30 mol% acceptor and 70 mol% donor lipid."

Choline, which is present in all headgroups of here used donor lipids, gives a strong 1H-NMR signal, which is shifted if the headgroup is surrounded by Pr3+. Adding the reagent after sample preparation affects only outer leaflet headgroups within the timescale of the experiment and thereby allows to discriminate against the signal of inner leaflet cholinelipids.

Compared to this previous study, we did not use lipids with deuterated hydrocarbons. Firstly, because our NSE\nManuscript submitted to Biophysical Journal 3\nFrewein et al.\nexperiments required fully protiated samples for optimal contrast, and secondly, because of their limited commercial availability. Consequently we are not able to discriminate the structure of the individual leaflets. Structural parameters, such as the lateral area per lipid, \ud835\udc34, are thus averaged over both leaflets. The chain thickness \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc36 of each leaflet was estimated from the position of the terminal methyl group. Note that this might not necessarily correspond to the center at the membrane, especially for samples containing the highly chain asymmetric MSM (12).\nData were fitted following (24), but additionally constraining lipid composition of inner and outer leaflets with results from GC, HPTLC and 1H-NMR experiments as described by Eicher et al. (25). Further, we fixed the distance between the hydrophobic interface and the backbone \ud835\udc51BB = 0.9 \u00c5, the width of the Gaussians describing backbone \ud835\udf0eBB = 2.1 \u00c5 and the outermost headgroup (choline/amine) \ud835\udf0eChol = 3 \u00c5 and the smearing of the error-function describing the hydrophobic-hydrophilic interface \ud835\udf0eCH2 = 2.5 \u00c5.

In brief, the mean squared displacement (MSD), \u27e8\u0394\ud835\udc5f (\ud835\udc61)2\u27e9, of the membrane from a flat geometry is related to the intermediate scattering function \ud835\udc46(\ud835\udc5e, \ud835\udc61) assuming a Gaussian distribution of fluctuations, which at the same time is required to follow the ZG model\n\ud835\udc46(\ud835\udc5e, \ud835\udc61) \ud835\udc46(\ud835\udc5e) \u221d exp\n[ \u2212\ud835\udc5e\n2\u27e8\u0394\ud835\udc5f (\ud835\udc61)2\u27e9 6\n] ! = exp [ \u2212(\u0393\ud835\udc5e\ud835\udc61)2/3 ] , (1)\nwhere \ud835\udc46(\ud835\udc5e) = \ud835\udc46(\ud835\udc5e, 0) is the elastic structure factor.

The advantage of the MSD approach is the ability to discriminate against deviations from the ZG prediction for the decay of \ud835\udc46(\ud835\udc5e, \ud835\udc61)/\ud835\udc46(\ud835\udc5e) either due to non-Gaussian fluctuations occurring at short Fourier times, or due to vesicle diffusion dynamics, which dominate current data at long Fourier times (29). This approach avoids any \u2019artificial\u2019 scaling by particle diffusion or interfacial viscosity (supplementary Fig. S3), which has led to significant controversies about bending rigidity values \ud835\udf05 on absolute scale reported from NSE (31).\nAfter ensuring the proper Fourier time range for the application of the ZG model we derived \ud835\udf05 following the model of Watson and Brown (32). This theory takes internal dissipation into account and arrives at \ud835\udf05 = \ud835\udf05 + 2\u210e2\ud835\udc58\ud835\udc5a, where \u210e is the position of the neutral surface and \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc5a is the monolayer area compressibility modulus. Further, using \ud835\udc58\ud835\udc5a = 12\ud835\udf05\ud835\udc5a/\ud835\udc372\ud835\udc36 , as predicted by the polymer brush model (21), and \ud835\udf05\ud835\udc5a = \ud835\udf05/2 (33) for each leaflet, one arrives at\n\ud835\udf05 = [ 1 + 48(\u210e/2\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc36 )2 ]\u22121 \ud835\udf05 (3)\nThe exact position of \u210e is not entirely clear and \u210e/2\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc36 and different groups report values between 0.25 and 0.6 (34). Following our work on intrinsic lipid curvatures (35) we assume that the neutral surface coincides with the lipid\u2019s backbone and calculate \u210e/(2\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc36 ) from results of our SAXS/SANS SDP-analysis."

The latter mixture mimics to first order the natural composition of the inner leaflet of mammalian plasma membranes (2). Exchange was performed with four different donor MLVs: MSM, ESM, POPC and POPC/MSM (1:1 mol/mol), the latter of which mimics the outer leaflet of plasma membranes. Further, comparing MSM and ESM allowed us to probe the effects of chain length distribution in sphingolipids. The achieved total exchange\n4 Manuscript submitted to Biophysical Journal\nAminophospholipids Stiffen Membranes\nand asymmetries are detailed in Tab. 1. Overall, exchange of the outer leaflet showed significant variations and was highest for POPEin/POPCout, where 65 mol% of acceptor lipid was replaced, a value which agrees well with a previous report (7). Exchange was in general low for both sphingolipids (< 30 mol%). This might also affect the molecular ratio of aLUVs containing POPC/MSM mixtures, i.e. the final POPC/MSM molar rations might be < 1. Note that 1H-NMR experiments performed on the chosen lipid moieties cannot be used to differentiate between phosphatidylcholines and sphingolipids. Such an analysis would require the application of headgroup deuterated species (36), which is beyond the scope of the present study.\nIn the next step, we determined the corresponding membrane structural parameters using the joint analysis of SANS and SAXS data. The transbilayer structure was parsed into the volume distributions of phosphate (PCN), choline-CH3 (CholCH3), glycerol or sphingosine backbone (BB), methylene/methine (chains), and methyl (CH3) groups, including also bound water in the headgroup region (12). The applied model is in principle capable of deriving leaflet-specific structural details (12). However, the structural resolution of the individual leaflets is poor in the absence of deuterated phospholipids. Deriving leaflet specific structural details is specifically challenged by the fact that the location of the terminal methyl groups \u2014 especially for the highly chain asymmetric MSM \u2014 might not be exactly at the center of an asymmetric bilayer (12, 24). Therefore, we report the areas per lipid averaged over both leaflets, \ud835\udc34av, for aLUVs in Table 1; non-averaged, leaflet-specific structural data are listed in Tab. S3; fits are shown in Fig. S5. Additionally, we report in Table 1 the corresponding structural parameters for scrambled vesicles, that is LUVs with the same, but symmetric lipid composition; fits to SANS/SAXS data are shown in Figs. S10 \u2013 S16 and structural details in Tabs. S5 \u2013 S7. We note deviations in the SAXS data fits of some samples at very low scattering angles. The origin of these deviations is most likely due to issues with assigning proper contrast in the headgroup regime. However, because membrane structure dominates scattering at higher \ud835\udc5e, the impact of this mismatch at low \ud835\udc5e on the derived structural parameters is rather low; see also (24) for more details.\nTo facilitate comparison between aLUVs and scrambled LUVs we additionally report the relative change in lipid area \u0394\ud835\udc34/\ud835\udc34 = (\ud835\udc34aLUV\ud835\udc4e\ud835\udc63 \u2212 \ud835\udc34scrambled)/\ud835\udc34scrambled in Tab. 1.

Exceptions to this finding are POPEin/ESMout with \u0394\ud835\udc34/\ud835\udc34 > 0 and (POPE/POPS)in/POPCout bilayers (\u0394\ud835\udc34/\ud835\udc34 \u223c 0)."

Data that do not follow the ZG theory have been omitted from further analysis. Figure 2 also demonstrates the sensitivity of the technique to fluctuation differences between symmetric and asymmetric bilayers.\nWe first tested our NSE analysis using DPPC LUVs at 50 \u25e6C as a benchmark system. Deriving the membrane bending rigidity requires, according to Eq. (3), the neutral plane, \u210e and the hydrocarbon thickness \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc36 . Assuming that \u210e coincides with the position of the glycerol backbone (35), we arrive at \u210e/(2\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc36 ) = 0.53 \u00b1 0.07 using previously reported data for DPPC bilayers (12). This result is well within the range of previously reported values for \u210e/(2\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc36 ) (34). Application of Eq. (3) then leads to \ud835\udf05 = 12.0 \u00b1 0.4 k\ud835\udc35T, which is almost three times lower than the bending rigidity of DPPC reported from other\nManuscript submitted to Biophysical Journal 5\nFrewein et al.\ntechniques (37). Note that alternative NSE evaluations of the same data also do not yield satisfactory agreement with literature values (Fig. S3). It has been suggested that including a separate tilt modulus in the NSE data analysis should be considered to harmonize \ud835\udf05-values from NSE with other techniques (38). Indeed, Guler et al. (39) reported \ud835\udf05 \u223c 15.0 k\ud835\udc35T for DPPC \u2014 a value which is very close to our present result \u2014 using X-ray scattering, without correcting for the tilt modulus. Only later this value was corrected to \ud835\udf05 \u223c 30 k\ud835\udc35T by including the tilt modulus in the analysis (37). Revising the theory for NSE to bring \ud835\udf05 to correct absolute scale levels is beyond the scope of the present study. Here it suffices to note that NSE is sensitive to relative changes of undulatory motions; see also inert to Fig. 2. We will thus discuss only the relative differences of \ud835\udf05 between the studied samples."

These samples allowed us to estimate the bending rigidities of each leaflet for the aLUVs in the absence of any coupling mechanism (see below).\nTable 2 summarizes the corresponding major results from SANS/SAXS and NSE experiments (see also Figs. S10 \u2013 S16, Tabs. S5 \u2013 S7). We briefly note some interesting elastic properties of these simple lipid systems: Firstly, the bending rigidity of POPC is lower than that of DPPC, despite its about equal membrane thickness (see the head-to-headgroup distances \ud835\udc37HH, reported in Tab. S4). This is surprising in view of the well-accepted polymer brush model (21), which predicts \ud835\udf05 \u221d \ud835\udc612\ud835\udc5a, where \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a is the mechanical thickness of the membrane, which is frequently set equal to \ud835\udc37HH. A recent computational approach showed that \ud835\udc61\ud835\udc5a can be smaller than \ud835\udc37HH for unsaturated hydrocarbons (40), which might explain our findings. Secondly, the bending rigidities of both sphingolipids are markedly higher than all other presently studied lipids. This indicates, additional contributions due to the different backbone-structure and the lipid\u2019s ability to form intermolecular H-bonds. Thirdly, the addition\n6 Manuscript submitted to Biophysical Journal\nAminophospholipids Stiffen Membranes\nof 30 mol% POPS to POPE increases the lateral area per lipid (Tab. S4), but does not lead to significant changes in \ud835\udf05. Possibly its concentration is still too low to cause membrane stiffening as reported for other charged bilayers (18, 19).\nThe bending rigidities of symmetric vesicles composed just of inner leaflet or outer leaflet lipid mixtures, detailed in Tab. 1, can now be estimated by interpolating the data reported in Tab. 2. Alternatively, one could have measured just vesicles with the exact leaflet compositions of Tab. 1. However, lipid exchange is difficult to predict. Thus, additional NSE, SAXS and SANS beamtimes would have been needed, just to measure the properties of these control samples. Our solution thus was to interpolate data, which was additionally aided by measuring the symmetric acceptor:donor lipid mixtures 9:1 (mol/mol) and 3:7 (mol/mol). These compositions roughly correspond to the inner and outer leaflet compositions of the aLUVs. The bending rigidity of POPC/MSM equimolar mixtures was calculated from the molecular average of \ud835\udf05 of the individual lipids. Plotting \ud835\udf05 of symmetric vesicles as a function of lipid composition, we observed clear linear trends for most studied bilayers (Fig. 3, Fig. S4), providing us with good confidence in the interpolated \ud835\udf05-values of the inner and outer leaflet mimics controls for comparing to the elasticity of aLUVs."

The bending rigidities of symmetric cognate leaflet samples correspond to upper and lower boundary expectation values for each system. In the case of uncoupled lipid\nManuscript submitted to Biophysical Journal 7\nFrewein et al.\nleaflets \ud835\udf05 of aLUVs should correspond to the arithmetic mean these boundary values (8). Measurements of scrambled LUVs provide an additional control for the effect of lipid distribution across the bilayer on bending fluctuations.\nFour aLUVs with inner leaflets enriched just in POPE were studied. These had outer leaflets with ESM, MSM, POPC, and equimolar mixtures of POPC and MSM. Differences in \ud835\udf05 between asymmetric and scrambled membranes were negligible within experimental certainty for POPE/ESM and POPE/MSM vesicles. Further, bending rigidities of these asymmetric membranes corresponded to the arithmetic averages of their cognate leaflet vesicles, indicating the absence of trans-bilayer elastic coupling. This seems to contrast a recent NSE study on POPEin/ESMout, reporting stiffer asymmetric bilayers as compared to their scrambled systems (17). However, the stiffening effect was mainly dominating at lower temperatures (30 \u25e6C), i.e. within the chain melting regime, and decreased upon increasing temperature to 45\u25e6C, the highest studied temperature by these authors. It thus appears that the stiffening effect is abolished upon further increasing temperature, i.e. when reaching the here used 50 \u25e6C. The other two aLUVs with POPE enriched inner leaflets behaved much different. When either POPC or POPC/MSM mixtures were present in the outer leaflet, aLUVs were much stiffer than all other symmetric control LUVs, i.e. exceeding even the upper boundaries of inner/outer leaflet LUVs. The stiffening effect was slightly more expressed for POPEin/POPCout, with\n8 Manuscript submitted to Biophysical Journal\nAminophospholipids Stiffen Membranes\n\u0394\ud835\udf05\ud835\udc5f \u2261 \ud835\udf05aLUV/\ud835\udf05scrambled \u223c 1.5, whereas \u0394\ud835\udf05\ud835\udc5f \u223c 1.4 for POPEin/(POPC/MSM)out. Asymmetric membranes with POPE/POPS mixtures showed even larger rigidity differences between aLUVs and scrambled vesicles. The largest relative bending changes between these two systems occurred again in case of POPC outer leaflets with \u0394\ud835\udf05\ud835\udc5f \u223c 2.2, followed by (POPC/MSM)out (\u0394\ud835\udf05\ud835\udc5f \u223c 1.9), and MSMout (\u0394\ud835\udf05\ud835\udc5f \u223c 1.7). Further, the MSMout aLUVs had an about equal bending rigidity than symmetric MSM-enriched outer leaflet vesicles. Asymmetric membranes with either POPC or POPC/MSM outer leaflets in turn revealed bending rigidities much outside the \ud835\udf05 boundaries set by the symmetric cognate leaflet vesicles."

            "heading": "DISCUSSION",
            "text": "We observed anomalous stiffening for most of the presently studied asymmetric lipid membranes. Here anomalous refers to bilayers, which are even stiffer than the upper rigidity boundary set by their symmetric cognate leaflet vesicles. A similar effect was previously reported for asymmetric giant unilamellar vesicles composed of POPC and DOPC (14), as well as DOPC and dimyristoylphosphatidylcholine (16). In turn, Rickeard et al. (17) found that the \ud835\udf05 values of POPE/ESM aLUVs matched those of outer leaflet symmetric vesicles for fluid bilayers. Thus, the bending rigidity of these asymmetric membranes was not anomalously stiffer than the symmetric controls, but dominated by the more rigid leaflets. We found a complete loss of this mechanical coupling for the same asymmetric membranes at slightly higher temperatures (Fig. 4), most likely due to interactions of entropic origin. Similarly, POPE/MSM aLUVs showed no anomalous coupling of its leaflets. In stark contrast, POPE/POPC asymmetric bilayers were about 1.5 times more rigid than the cognate leaflet systems, clearly signifying anomalous membrane stiffening. This effect was enhanced for aLUVs with POPE/POPS enriched inner leaflets, except for (POPE/POPS)in/MSMout, whose bending rigidity was dominated by the more rigid leaflet, following the above discussed behavior of POPE/ESM asymmetric membranes at lower temperatures (17).\nAttempting to reconcile our experimental observations within existing theoretical frameworks we first checked whether the differences could be simply understood in terms of the polymer brush model (21), i.e. differences in membrane thickness. Indeed, we observed a thickening of aLUVs for most presently systems, which would agree with a decreased bending flexibility (Tab. 1). Assuming that the area expansion modulus is not affected by membrane asymmetry, \u0394\ud835\udf05\ud835\udc5f , determined above from NSE experiments, can also be estimated using the \ud835\udc37HH-values reported in Tabs. S4, S6, and S7. This yields \u0394\ud835\udf05\ud835\udc5f values between 0.9 and 1.2 for the presently studied samples, but with no correlation to the \u0394\ud835\udf05\ud835\udc5f values found from NSE data (Fig. 4). This indicates that the area expansion modulus of asymmetric membranes differs significantly from that of scrambled vesicles, which would agree with a previous report (16).\nHossein and Deserno (8, 13) recently predicted a stiffening transition in asymmetric membranes based on differential stress (nonvanishing lateral tension) between the two leaflets. Such differential stress can arise either from compositional asymmetry, or leaflet under/overcrowding (number asymmetry). The latter type of asymmetry is difficult to control experimentally. Experimental studies using cyclodextrin-mediated lipid exchange, including this one, typically report some amounts of donor lipid within the inner leaflet (7, 12, 17, 36, 41). This suggests a rapid equilibration of any differential stress resulting from number asymmetry. We note that anomalous stiffening for asymmetric bilayers was also reported using a very different sample preparation technique (14, 16). Anomalous membrane stiffening thus is unlikely a manufacturing artifact.On quantitative grounds, we can use the area per lipid determined by SANS/SAXS as indicators of leaflet under/overcrowding. Table 1 reports the relative area per lipid changes between asymmetric and scrambled vesicles. In case of significant stress due to lateral area mismatch between leaflets in asymmetric membranes, we would expect also to observe corresponding area per lipid changes upon lipid scrambling due to stress relaxation. Variations of \u0394\ud835\udc34/\ud835\udc34 are, however, within a few percent, and do not correlate with the observed effects on bending rigidity. Hence, we can rule out membrane stiffening arising from number asymmetry.\nFocusing next on compositional asymmetry we estimate the differential stress in flat membranes (8)\n\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc51 = \ud835\udf05\ud835\udc3d0\ud835\udc4f 2\u210e , (4)\nwhere \ud835\udc3d0,\ud835\udc4f is the rigidity-weighted difference of the outer leaflet \ud835\udc3dOL0 and inner leaflet \ud835\udc3d IL 0 spontaneous curvatures and \ud835\udf05 = \ud835\udf05OL\ud835\udc5a + \ud835\udf05IL\ud835\udc5a is the leaflet averaged bending rigidity. Table 3 shows the results using previously reported spontaneous monolayer data (42, 43). The calculated \ud835\udc3d0,\ud835\udc4f\u2019s are all close to 0 and have with the exception of (POPE/POPS)in/(POPC/MSM)out all positive signs. Consequently, also differential stresses are rather small with absolute values varying between 0.16 mN/m and 0.95 mN/m. Correcting our \ud835\udf05 for contributions of the tilt modulus (see above) would increase the reported \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc51 values, but by not more than a factor of three, i.e. still yielding rather small \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc51\u2019s. Thus, contributions of compositional asymmetry to differential stress remain negligible, mostly due to the small \ud835\udc3d0,\ud835\udc4f values. Moreover, relative changes of \ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc51 also do not explain the variation of \ud835\udf05 for different samples and anomalous stiffening (Fig. 4). In particular aLUVs with the highest \ud835\udf05 are among those with lowest |\ud835\udf0e\ud835\udc51 |.\nManuscript submitted to Biophysical Journal 9\nFrewein et al.\nFor the sake of the argument \u2014 and in absence of any theory we are aware of \u2014 let us therefore speculate on the putative role of fluctuations. The undulatory motions of the fluctuation spectrum of lipid membranes comprise of bending and protrusion modes (44, 45). Here, we probed bending modes, which dominate the fluctuation spectrum for distances larger than the membrane thickness. At shorter distances these interleaflet dynamics are thought be essentially decoupled. In this \u2019protrusion regime\u2019 shorter wavelengths fluctuations (alternatively hard modes) are dominated by single lipid motions (e.g. protrusions). While this theory agrees well with large scale molecular dynamics simulations of symmetric bilayers (44, 45) it is less clear if it applies also to asymmetric membranes. For instance, our data might suggest that fluctuations in some of our aLUVs are coupled even at distances smaller than the membrane thickness, increasing the weight of \u2018hard\u2019 modes on bending fluctuations. This enhanced intra leaflet coupling appears to particularly occur for POPC-enriched outer leaflets. Both, POPE and POPS carry primary amines in their headgroups, enabling intermolecular H-bond formation, which is indeed known to stabilize bilayer structure (46). The headgroup charge of POPS additionally seems to accentuate the intraleaflet coupling, possibly by giving rise to a transmembrane potential, or by increasing contributions from surface tension. It would be interesting to modulate in future experiments their contribution by changing the pH or ionic strength of the aqueous phase.\nInterestingly, no anomalous elastic coupling was observed for ESM and MSM-enriched outer leaflets and the stiffening effect was partially reduced for POPC/MSM mixtures. ESM and MSM are natural lipid extracts, containing also some long acyl chains. In particular, MSM is highly chain-asymmetric with mostly 22:0, 23:0 and 24:0 hydrocarbons and thus prone to interdigitation (12). The hydrocarbon chain composition of ESM is dominated by 16:0 hydrocarbons, but also contains few longer hydrocarbons which can interdigitate into the opposing leaflet. Hydrocarbon interdigitation of POPC in turn is negligible (24). Consequently, our data suggest that the anomalous mechanical coupling induced by the enrichment of aminophospholipids in one leaflet can be alleviated by hydrocarbon interdigitation.\nThe potential biological relevance is as intriguing as our findings. Several cellular processes, occurring either at large scales, such as the formation of exo-, or endosomes, or within the single molecular regime, e.g. transport or signalling events, depend on membrane elasticity (4, 5). By tuning the leaflet distribution of lipids in given regions of the plasma membrane through an orchestrated operation of flipases/flopases and scramblases cells might control its elasticity over a broad range of bending rigidites and exploit its effect on certain cellular processes. Indeed, there appears to be experimental evidence for softer scrambled plasma membranes derived from live cell as compared to their native states (Ilya Levental, personal communication). Further scrutiny of the here reported systems, including cholesterol and different buffer conditions is challenging but certainly warranted."

These effects can be alleviated at least in part by the addition of sphingomyelin in the outer leaflet, possibly due to hydrocarbon chain interdigitation. We speculate that an asymmetric distribution of lipids with specific properties (charge, H-bonding abilities) leads to an enhanced mechanical coupling of membranes, by increasing the weight of hard undulatory modes through intraleaflet interactions. This strongly encourages theoretical and computational studies along those directions. Although the presently studied systems still lack important components of mammalian plasma membranes\n10 Manuscript submitted to Biophysical Journal\nAminophospholipids Stiffen Membranes\n(e.g. cholesterol) it is plausible that cells have evolved to a state where they can exploit a large range of bending rigidities for protein function by dynamically modulating leaflet-specific lipid composition."
