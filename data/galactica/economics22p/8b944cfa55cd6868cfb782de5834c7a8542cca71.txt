Understanding the processes of residential solar PV uptake is critical to developing planning and policy energy transition pathways. This paper outlines a novel hybrid Agent-Based-Modelling/statistical adoption prediction framework that addresses several drawbacks in current modelling approaches. Specifically, we extend the capabilities of similar previous models and incorporate empirical data, behavioural theory, social networks and explicitly considers the spatial context. We provide empirical data affecting households’ propensity to adopt, including perceptions of solar PV systems, the role of tenure and urban location. We demonstrate the approach in the context of Melbourne metropolitan region, Australia; and draw on housing approval data to demonstrate the role of housing construction in accelerating adoption. Finally, we explore the approach’s validity against real-world data with promising results that also indicate key areas for further research and improvement. It is notable that micro-level validation reporting was not found in the reporting of similar models.

To evaluate the macro-level predictive capacity, we calculate the R-Squared (as traditionally defined: 1 minus the unexplained variance divided by the total variance) for each of the LGAs and each of the years. The total variance is the statistical variance of all observations, while the unexplained variance is the statistical variance of the errors. The R-Squared results are shown in Figure 5 and Figure 6, representing the results from the full calibration period. Spatially, the R-Squared ranges from 0.62-0.97 with only Glen Eira and Moreland having values below 0.85. Temporally, the predictive capacity ranges from 0.40-0.96. For the validation year in 2020 (i.e., the forward data), the R-Squared was first 0.66, indicating a reasonable goodness-of-fit which can nonetheless be improved. After deliberation, it was deemed that the major difficulty was the introduction of a new rebate for households with certain eligibility criteria that limited uptake. After calibrating a rebate effect (see Calibration Section, 4.1) the R-Squared was 0.86. Although there is variation spatially and temporally in predictive capacity, the aggregate predictive capacity is relatively high across either dimension. Unfortunately, similar models are not reporting R-Squared (which we think is the appropriate measure here) for their approaches, so it is difficult to compare (Lee & Hong 2019; Zhao et al. 2011).

However, this evidence is so far circumstantial and can’t be statistically confirmed, especially, as key changes in feed-in tariffs and rebate policies have changed at similar times. on temporal variability  on spatial variability 5.10 The average size of solar PV systems installed (2001-2020) has a correlation (with the LGA-factor) of 0.18; the proportion of space being public open space has a correlation (with the LGA-factor) of 0.45, and the proportion of new construction that are new homes has a correlation (with the LGA-factor) of 0.55. This points towards the unexplained variability being primarily about the availability of space for solar PV systems, as well as towards the need for more accurate data for new homes rather than new home constructions in the simulation model. Future models should account for this effect. JASSS, 25(4) 2, 2022 http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/25/4/2.html Doi: 10.18564/jasss.4921
5.11 A regression model with these variables to describe the LGA-factor has an R-squared of 0.72 although the average size of the solar PV system had a non-significant contribution. Further spatial analysis is underway to understand the reason for the remaining 28% of the spatial variability. This variability may be linked with spatial variation in dwelling types, urban form and building shadow, tenure and natural characteristics of areas (e.g., foliage, elevation) which may impact on the productivity of small-scale rooftop solar PV systems. 5.12 A range of local circumstances are known to influence spatial variability. For example, in outer suburban areas there can be relatively lower adoption due to extensive industrial or parkland areas, or university precincts. In more densely built-up areas or areas with larger proportions of rental properties, property rights dimensions (such as body corporate restrictions, air-rights, common space, ownership of usable surfaces) as well as coordination barriers (i.e., decisions may need coordination of multiple users and owners to maximise efficiency of microgrids rather than individual rooftop solar PV systems) may inhibit the uptake of rooftop solar PV systems. Housing construction as a catalyst of solar PV adoption
5.13 A key finding in this article is how construction of new housing, at the very least in the context of Melbourne metropolitan region, is a key driver of solar PV adoption. To show this effect, we have drawn on building approval data and this contributes significantly to the accuracy of predictions. Alipour et al. (2021) noted that this type of data, on construction, was previously only incorporated in one other study on this topic, and never within a comprehensive framework such as the one described here. 5.14 In this article, we have described the adoption of solar PVs on newly constructed homes in a relatively crude way based on: 1) the notion that construction triggers a decision whether to install solar PVs, due to the opportunity that has arisen, and 2) that the likelihood of adoption is a factorµk,j (here calibrated to 5.74) larger than in other circumstances for the same household. With the available data, only such a relatively crude model is feasible, which is to some extent regrettable. 5.15 This lack of appropriate data that connects solar PV adoption with new home construction shows a key knowledge gap. Importantly, when we designed the survey, the role of construction was not considered. This is because the role of housing construction in driving solar PV adoption was not widely acknowledged in literature (if at all), and that we only learnt about this effect after interrogation and validating the model, which led us to make adjustments, which was also confirmed by solar PV experts that we conferred with about this result. In other words, we propose that further research undertaken so that:
• Data is collected specifically on solar PV adoption for new homes. Experts argue that there is a window of about 2 years after construction when there is an increased chance of adoption. Either because of the opportunities associated with construction, and secondly as experts report that households commonly find the energy efficiency of the new home to be lacking, and therefore commonly opt for installing solar PVs to compensate. • Data is collected to better understand the socio-psychological and economic drivers for adoption of those who build new homes, or that retrofit existing homes. Data improvement for energy transition
5.16 The 79% accuracy of the predictions of ownership or intentions at an individual level could be improved. This indicates opportunities for gathering further data, and based on our analysis, there are areas of interests, specifically:
• Whether residents are living in recently constructed housing,
• Peer-influence,
• Awareness and access amongst participants relating to financial incentives, and
• Whether participants have been contacted by solar PV sales companies. 5.17 We also know that visual cues play a role in influencing adoption in some contexts (Bollinger & Gillingham 2012; Copiello 2018; Parkins et al. 2018). We propose that research is undertaken in Australia to confirm and quantify this effect, as well as to further build this into the quantitative approach. 5.18 Finally, there is an opportunity for more comprehensive modelling of the actor ecosystem. This more comprehensive approach for exploring the complexities of the residential Solar PV market in Australia could be enabled by incorporating the ecosystem of actors, providing a more integrated exploration of policies and interventions; for example, similar to that done by Moglia et al. (2018) when exploring residential energy-efficiency. JASSS, 25(4) 2, 2022 http://jasss.soc.surrey.ac.uk/25/4/2.html Doi: 10.18564/jasss.4921 potential users 5.19 We imagine two types of users of the model. Firstly, we imagine that this model could be usefully employed by electricity network planners, to inform infrastructure investment decisions. Secondly, we imagine that this model could be usefully employed by planners in government departments, whose job it is to fine-tune policies and regulations to boost the adoption rates of solar PV systems in a fair, equitable and cost-effective manner. 5.20 Therefore, our approach has been informed by discussions by energy distribution companies who require better predictive capacity for solar PV adoption, so that they can plan to have the required infrastructure. Among other things, this has informed our choice of spatial granularity (local government areas i.e., LGAs). conclusions 6.1 This paper reports on the development of a hybrid model to improve modelling and policy analysis for solar PV uptake. The modelling results show that high rates of adoption will likely accelerate into future years, but also that structural barriers can vary across the cities. 6.2 Methodologically, our study contributes to an emerging understanding of so-called hybrid approaches that integrate statistical methods within an ABM simulation framework. This combines the flexibility and exploratory capabilities of ABM with the empirical rigor of statistical methods. Our approach, as one instance of a hybrid approach, is shown to provide relatively accurate predictions at an aggregate level, but with clear directions of opportunities for improvements. The model also shows promising predictive capacity at a micro-level. 6.3 Methodologically, the hybrid approach provides a series of analytical advantages. First, greater flexibility for policy analysis. There is very considerable opportunity in an ABM to specify hypothetical scenarios without having to formulate such scenarios in terms of exact equations. Second, opportunity for calibration of parameters where appropriate statistical data is unavailable. In this article, we have included the proposed impacts of peer influence and construction of housing, even when statistical data is missing. Third, population heterogeneity. This allows for a richer understanding of how individual agents interact with each other and their environment. Fourth, model extensions are relatively straightforward, even when such extensions include nonlinear and complex interactions. Extendibility is important because these types of models have the capacity act as knowledge representations, or knowledge artefacts that support ongoing learning. 6.4 In terms of the substantive contribution about modelling the adoption of residential solar PVs, the choice of predictors and collection of data on those predictors is the most important step for improving the accuracy of predictions. Despite reviewing a large body of literature on factors that influence solar PV adoption behaviour, and collecting data on those factors, we still seem to have missed some of the factors that focus on housing construction and peer influence. In fact, there seems to be no solar PV adoption model in existence that uses the full and comprehensive list of predictive factors. Our study represents one of the most comprehensive models in this respect. 6.5 We also note that to maximise predictive capacity unfortunately requires surveys of the community which comes at a cost. Modelling without such surveys may still provide somewhat accurate results, especially when it is possible to draw on accurate census data, solar PV adoption data and housing construction data. The most important dataset for enabling the hybrid approach is the solar PV adoption data provided by public agencies. This data proved very useful as it allows for calibration of model parameters. This data would be even more useful if there was a further breakdown of the characteristics of adopters, for example providing demographic or socio-economic data. We also note the role of policy settings, especially around financial incentives and this remains a topic that needs further exploration, although a key barrier in the current settings in Melbourne seems to relate to income and property value tests that exclude part of the population from access to rebates. 6.6 Furthermore, as perhaps the first study to do so, we have been able to demonstrate the role of housing construction in these adoption processes. Specifically, we have shown that, at the very least in the Melbourne context, housing construction is a critical mechanism by which uptake is accelerated, and conversely, we have identified that high rates of renting, and apartment living, or high rates of housing where local building regulations make adoption difficult, leads to significantly slower adoption. This shows the need for financial innovation and/or policy innovations and interventions that help overcome such barriers, as this would help to improve sustainability and equity outcomes.
6.8 In summary, the comprehensiveness, design and details of this framework combined with a hybrid approach makes it a novel and useful contribution that can inform policy analysis as well as infrastructure planning decisions and support the transition towards greater uptake of renewable energy. acknowledgements This study had some funding from the Low Carbon Living CRC.
