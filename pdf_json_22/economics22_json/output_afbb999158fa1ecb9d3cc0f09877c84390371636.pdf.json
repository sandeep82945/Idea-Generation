    "abstractText": "Background. DIALOG\u00fe is a digital psychosocial intervention aimed at making routine meetings between patients and clinicians therapeutically effective. This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of implementing DIALOG\u00fe treatment for patients with psychotic disorders in five lowand middle-income countries in Southeast Europe alongside a cluster randomised trial. Methods. Resource use and quality of life data were collected alongside the multi-country cluster randomised trial of 468 participants with psychotic disorders. Due to COVID-19 interruptions of the trial\u2019s original 12-month intervention period, adjusted costs and qualityadjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated at the participant level using a mixed-effects model over the first 6 months only. We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) with uncertainty presented using a cost-effectiveness plane and a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. Seven sensitivity analyses were conducted to check the robustness of the findings. Results. The average cost of delivering DIALOG\u00fe was \u20ac91.11 per participant. DIALOG\u00fe was associated with an incremental health gain of 0.0032 QALYs (95% CI \u20130.0015, 0.0079), incremental costs of \u20ac84.17 (95% CI \u20138.18, 176.52), and an estimated ICER of \u20ac26,347.61. The probability of DIALOG\u00fe being cost-effective against three times the weighted gross domestic product (GDP) per capita for the five participating countries was 18.9%. Conclusion. Evidence from the cost-effectiveness analyses in this study suggested that DIALOG\u00fe involved relatively low costs. However, it is not likely to be cost-effective in the five participating countries compared with standard care against a willingness-to-pay threshold of three times the weighted GDP per capita per QALY gained. Introduction The international prevalence of psychotic disorders is approximately 0.75% [1], and the life expectancy of people with psychosis is 10\u201315 years shorter than the general population [2]. These illnesses are usually associated with poor quality of life and multi-morbidity [3]. They also often lead to high societal costs, including direct costs for patients\u2019 healthcare and costs related to productivity losses [4]. In lowand middle-income countries (LMICs) in Southeast Europe, an estimated 45% of patients with psychotic disorders have experienced a treatment gap (i.e., difference between the treatment they require and the treatment they receive) [5\u20137]. This is the result of shortages in funding and qualified staff, and a high patient load. Reducing the treatment gap in those countries through the implementation of effective and low-cost interventions is an urgent need. European Psychiatry www.cambridge.org/epa",

This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of implementing DIALOG\u00fe treatment for patients with psychotic disorders in five low- and middle-income countries in Southeast Europe alongside a cluster randomised trial. Methods. Resource use and quality of life data were collected alongside the multi-country cluster randomised trial of 468 participants with psychotic disorders. Due to COVID-19 interruptions of the trial\u2019s original 12-month intervention period, adjusted costs and qualityadjusted life years (QALYs) were estimated at the participant level using a mixed-effects model over the first 6 months only. We estimated the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) with uncertainty presented using a cost-effectiveness plane and a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve. Seven sensitivity analyses were conducted to check the robustness of the findings. Results. The average cost of delivering DIALOG\u00fe was \u20ac91.11 per participant. DIALOG\u00fe was associated with an incremental health gain of 0.0032 QALYs (95% CI \u20130.0015, 0.0079), incremental costs of \u20ac84.17 (95% CI \u20138.18, 176.52), and an estimated ICER of \u20ac26,347.61. The probability of DIALOG\u00fe being cost-effective against three times the weighted gross domestic product (GDP) per capita for the five participating countries was 18.9%. Conclusion. Evidence from the cost-effectiveness analyses in this study suggested that DIALOG\u00fe involved relatively low costs. However, it is not likely to be cost-effective in the five participating countries compared with standard care against a willingness-to-pay threshold of three times the weighted GDP per capita per QALY gained.\nIntroduction\nThe international prevalence of psychotic disorders is approximately 0.75% [1], and the life expectancy of people with psychosis is 10\u201315 years shorter than the general population [2]. These illnesses are usually associated with poor quality of life and multi-morbidity [3]. They also often lead to high societal costs, including direct costs for patients\u2019 healthcare and costs related to productivity losses [4]. In low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in Southeast Europe, an estimated 45% of patients with psychotic disorders have experienced a treatment gap (i.e., difference between the treatment they require and the treatment they receive) [5\u20137]. This is the result of shortages in funding and qualified staff, and a high patient load. Reducing the treatment gap in those countries through the implementation of effective and low-cost interventions is an urgent need.\nKey words: Cluster randomised trial; Cost-effectiveness; DIALOG\u00fe; Low- and middle-income countries in Southeast Europe; Psychotic disorders\nAddress for correspondence: *Yan Feng, Wolfson Institute of Population Health, Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry, Queen Mary University of London, Yvonne Carter Building, 58 Turner Street Whitechapel, London UK, E1 2AB, E-mail: yan.feng@qmul.ac.uk\n\u00a9 The Author(s), 2022.

Previously, interactions between psychotic patients and clinicians in routine face-to-face clinical meetings were guided solely by clinical judgment rather than evidence-based methods [8, 9]. DIALOG\u00fe was originally developed to make meetings therapeutically effective [8]. To do this, the intervention implements a structured self-assessment for patients during the meetings and provides guidance for clinicians on how to respond to patients\u2019 ratings. Previous studies have shown that using DIALOG\u00fe is effective in improving the quality of life for patients with psychosis in UK community-based settings [8, 10]. Furthermore, the effectiveness of DIALOG\u00fe has been extensively studied in mental health care across multiple countries and in different healthcare settings [11\u201314].\nAs DIALOG\u00fe is used in existing routine patient\u2013clinician meetings, it does not require the formation of new services or hiring of new staff, and only requires that the existing service makes a one-off investment in computer tablets. The intervention can then be widely used by clinicians with minimal training, making it a good fit for healthcare systems with scarce resources [15]. Evidence from high-income settings suggests that DIALOG\u00fe is a cost-saving intervention for people with mental disorders [10]. The intervention also has the potential to deliver benefits for psychotic patients in low-resource settings. However, no study has previously evaluated its implementation in LMICs in Southeast Europe. A multi-country cluster randomised trial within the IMPULSE study was conducted to fill this empirical gap. The trial aimed to evaluate the effectiveness and costeffectiveness of implementing DIALOG\u00fe in five LMICs in Southeast Europe compared to standard care for patients with psychotic disorders [15].\nThe primary aim of this paper is to report the cost-effectiveness analyses of the DIALOG\u00fe intervention versus standard care carried out in five Southeast European countries alongside the cluster randomised trial within the IMPULSE study."

These countries shared similar socioeconomic and political backgrounds before the 1990s, which facilitated the trial setup and mutual learning across sites [15]. Eligible participants were identified through a review of medical records. Participants were eligible if they had: a primary diagnosis of psychosis or related disorder in remission with ICD-10 code F20-29 or F31; a lifetime history of being admitted to hospital at least once; a record of attending outpatient psychiatric services; and the capacity to providewritten informed consent. Participants with diagnoses of organic brain disorders and/or severe cognitive deficits were excluded from the trial. Clinicians were randomised to either the intervention group (DIALOG\u00fe) or control group (standard care). Details about the trial methodology and implementation of the intervention can be found in the trial protocol [15]. The trial was launched in March 2019 and completed in July 2020."

The intervention is based on the quality of life research, and embeds the concepts of a patient-centered approach and solutionfocused therapy in order to provide an evidence-based structure to routine clinicalmeetings between patients and clinicians. The intervention consists of two parts: (1) a patient self-rating exercise of satisfaction with their life and treatment, followed by (2) a four-step solution-focused discussion that aims to address the patients\u2019 concerns and agree on further actions.\nThe trial was designed so that participants in the intervention group would receive six sessions of treatment during their routine outpatient consultations over a 12-month period. In accordance with the DIALOG\u00fe manual [16], each session lasted between 30 and 60 minutes. In the first 3 months, participants received one session per month, followed by one session every 3 months.\nEvery intervention session started with the patient self-rating their satisfaction with eight life domains (mental health, physical health, job satisfaction, accommodation, leisure activities, partner/ family, friendships, personal safety) and three treatment domains (medication, practical help, meetings with clinician) using the DIALOG\u00fe app installed in computer tablets. Next, clinicians were instructed to provide positive feedback to patients for any domain that was scored highly by patients and (from session two onwards) for domains with an improvement in rating from previous sessions. After the self-rating exercise, clinicians and patients identified a maximumof three domains for discussions. These discussions were guided by a four-step approach based on the principles of solutionfocused therapy. Finally, the patients and clinicians jointly agreed on actions to improve the patients\u2019 satisfaction with the discussed domain(s). At the beginning of the next session, they reviewed those actions together [17]. Each clinician in the intervention group received face-to-face training by a local research team member before the first DIALOG\u00fe session, followed by top-up training after delivering the third session. Clinicians were also able to access individual supervision provided by the study researchers after each session. A computer tablet with DIALOG\u00fe installed was offered to each clinician prior to the first session."

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic (see section title \u201cImpact of the COVID-19 pandemic\u201d), only data collected at baseline and 6 months after randomisation were used in the analysis.\nThe EQ-5D-5L measured the primary economic evaluation outcome. EQ-5D-5L data were converted to index scores by applying the EQ-5D-5L value set. There was no country-specific value set available for any of the five participating countries, so we applied the newly published EQ-5D-5L value set for Poland [21] in Central Europe as the best proxy available. Quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for participants during the first 6-month period of the trial were calculated using the area-under-the-curve method and EQ-5D-5L index scores [22]. MANSA measured the primary clinical effectiveness outcome in the IMPULSE trial. MANSA scores were calculated as the mean of the instrument\u2019s 12 individual item scores. ReQoL-10 is a new instrument for measuring the quality of life in people with mental health conditions. For ReQoL-10 data, simple sum scores on the instrument\u2019s 10 questions were calculated.\nFor all three outcome measures, lower score indicates poorer quality of life. EQ-5D-5L index scores have a theoretical range between 0.590 and 1. The range is 1 to 7 for MANSA scores, and 0 to 40 for ReQoL-10 scores."

The CSRI recorded participants\u2019 use of inpatient hospital services, community care service, primary care service, and medication. We collected unit costs for each item from the local teams in the five participating countries. Data on participants\u2019 socio-demographics, employment status, monthly income, number of days off from work due to mental and/or physical health issues, amount of state benefits claimed, and criminal records were also collected using the CSRI.\nWe developed a health economics inventory form to collect cost data for providing DIALOG\u00fe and standard care treatments. Items included time spent by clinicians on the DIALOG\u00fe training, time spent by clinicians and supporting staff on treatments, quantity of equipment and key materials used for providing treatments. We also collected the unit cost for each item using the inventory form.\nWe converted all unit costs from local currencies to euros at the year 2019 level with Purchasing Power Parity (EU28 = 1 as the reference base) adjusted [24]. Costs for each item were then calculated as a product of the quantity used and its corresponding unit cost. Finally, we summed all costs together and presented the cost data at participant and assessment time-point levels. There was no discount applied to adjust costs and outcomes data as the time horizon of the study was 6 months [25].\nOutcome and costmeasures used in the economic evaluation are validated scales, including EQ-5D-5L [18], MANSA [19], ReQoL10 [20] andCSRI [23].

Independent t-tests were used for all comparisons. The 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were constructed using a bootstrap method with 1,000 replications. We also applied a three-level mixed-effects model to recognise the clustered nature of our data where participants nested within clinicians that nested within countries. The model controlled for baseline variables (i.e., costs or outcomes) and covariates (i.e., age of participants, ICD-10 code, and profession of clinicians).\nWe conducted the within-trial analyses from a healthcare perspective under the principle of intention-to-treat. Time horizon for the economic evaluation was 6 months, starting from the implementation of the intervention at baseline. This was consistent with the time horizon for the effectiveness evaluation of DIALOG\u00fe in the IMPULSE trial [14].\nCost\u2013utility analysis was used to conduct the base case economic evaluation. Costs included intervention costs, health service costs, and medication costs. The primary economic outcome measure used QALYs calculated from the EQ-5D-5L index scores. We estimated the incremental costs (and incremental QALYs) as the difference between the intervention and control groups over the first 6 months of the trial period, controlling for baseline values, participants\u2019 ages, ICD-10 code, and profession of clinicians. A three-level mixed-effects model was applied. The pattern of missing values with three variables (i.e., costs at baseline, costs, and QALYs over the 6-month period) was assumed as missing at random. Multiple imputation with chained equations was applied to generate 70 imputed data sets (the largest fraction of missing information was 0.5258). The point estimate of the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was calculated by dividing the estimated incremental costs by the estimated incremental QALYs. To explore the uncertainty around the point estimate, we used the non-parametric bootstrap approach with 1,000 replications to estimate the 95% CI around the ICER [26]. The result was presented using a cost-effectiveness plane. We also constructed a cost-effectiveness acceptability curve to show the probability that DIALOG\u00fe was cost-effective compared with standard care for a range of willingness-to-pay values for an additional QALY gained.\nThere is no evidence-based cost-effectiveness threshold to apply in multi-country trials for LMICs [27]. The World Health Organization has recommended using one to three times the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita of an LMIC as the costeffectiveness threshold for the country [28, 29]. An intervention with an estimated ICER of less than three times the national annual GDP per capita is considered cost-effective. In our base case evaluation, we compared our point estimate of the ICER against one to three times the weighted GPD per capita. The weights are proportions of participants from each country out of the total trial sample size.\nTo check the robustness of the findings from the base case evaluation, we conducted seven sensitivity analyses. First, we ran the base case analysis with complete cases only (i.e., withoutmissing values). Second, the seemingly unrelated regression model without robust standard error was applied to compare the impact of the\nhttps://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.2310 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nmodel choice [30]. Third, we estimated two ICERs using the minimum (and maximum) unit costs, respectively, for all medications from each country when unit costs for somemedications were reported in a range. Fourth, we undertook analyses using a broader analytical perspective, including costs due to productivity lost as a result of mental or physical health problems. In the fifth and sixth sensitivity analyses, we replaced the outcome measure EQ-5D-5L index scores with MANSA scores and ReQoL-10 sum scores, respectively. Finally, we estimated country-specific ICERs by applying the method developed by Willke and colleagues [31].\nStatistical significance was determined at the 5% level (p < 0.05). All analyses were performedwith the software package STATA/MP 17 [32]."

            "text": "The main cost-effectiveness analysis suggested that DIALOG\u00fe is slightly more costly and slightly more effective than standard care over the first 6 months of the trial period. The point estimate of the ICER was higher than the willingness-to-pay value at three times the weighted GDP per capita of the five participating countries. Regarding the uncertainty of this point estimate, our results suggested that the probability was low (18.9%) that DIALOG\u00fe was cost-effective compared with standard care at the provider\u2019s willingness-to-pay threshold. We conducted sensitivity analyses to explore the impact of missing values, estimation methods, key parameters for costs, and evaluation perspectives. None of these analyses challenged the main finding. In country-specific analyses, we found DIALOG\u00fe was more effective and more costly in four of the five participating countries (and the point estimate of the ICER was not cost-effective). Kosovo (UN Resolution) alone showed DIALOG\u00fe as more effective and less costly than standard care. This result should be interpreted with caution as the trial was not powered to detect country-specific treatment effects (in particular, for the EQ-5D-5L measure). Cost analyses shared similar limitations. Additionally, a few unit costs for resource use in Kosovo (UN Resolution) were proxied by the lowest unit price among the other four participating countries due to absence of an official local data source. Country-specific costs for total resource use per\nhttps://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.2310 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nparticipant and outcomes by trial group is reported in Supplementary Appendices 3 and 4, respectively.\nIn this trial, we observed modest improvements of quality of life measured by three instruments. Only the difference in MANSA scores (i.e., the primary clinical effectiveness outcome in the IMPULSE trial) between the intervention and control groups was statistically significant [14]. The primary economic evaluation relied on QALYs derived from the EQ-5D-5L data as the outcome measure. It should be noted that the EQ-5D-5L has been criticized for its sensitivity regarding people with psychotic disorders and severe and complex nonpsychotic disorders [33]. It has been argued that a condition-specific instrument might be more sensitive in reflecting changes in quality of life in these populations than a generic instrument like the EQ-5D-5L.\nDIALOG\u00fe has previously been applied in community care settings in the UK for patients with psychosis [10]. The UK study found that the treatment was less costly than standard care, which was not in line with the results from our IMPULSE study. The study did not collect EQ-5D-5L data, which was one of the limitations reported by its authors. We, therefore, were unable to make a direct comparison between IMPULSE and the UK study of patients\u2019 selfreported EQ-5D-5L and QALYs.\nEvidence of cost-effectiveness analyses of treatments for severe mental illness in Southeast Europe is scarce [15]. Treatments are predominantly provided in large psychiatric hospitals with limited community-based alternatives. However, a recently published\neconomic evaluation in the Czech Republic showed that it is costeffective to discharge patients with chronic psychotic disorders to community care compared with care in psychiatric hospitals [4]. This finding supports one of the aims of introducing DIALOG\u00fe in the LMIC settings, namely, to provide effective and costeffective mental health treatment for psychotic patients through community-based services.\nTo our knowledge, this study reports the first cost-effectiveness evaluation of implementing (non-pharmacological) psychosocial treatments for people with psychosis in Southeast Europe. A strength of this study is the trial data that we collected. The challenges around data collection and lack of country-specific unit cost data in multi-country randomised controlled trials are well documented in the literature [29]. It has widely been observed in economic evaluations of multi-country clinical trials that the analyses applied unit costs from one country to all participating countries due to lack of unit cost data from all individual countries [29, 34]. A concern with this approach is around the possibility of generating biased (over/under) estimates for costs. In the IMPULSE trial, we collected resource use and outcomes data at the patient level, as well as country-specific unit costs for each resource item used. This strategy for data collection enabled patient-level data analyses with multi-country costing.\nThis study has several limitations that should be considered. First, there were no country-specific value sets for the three outcome measures (EQ-5D-5L, MANSA, ReQoL-10). As we observed\nhttps://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.2310 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nTable 5.

We reported the results of cost-effectiveness analyses in this paper using ReQoL-10 and MANSA to enable comparisons with future research. Another consideration is around the generalizability of our findings. This issue is well documented for economic evaluations of multi-country randomised controlled trials [29, 35]. We showed different results in cost analyses from the application of the DIALOG\u00fe in the UK [10]. Care should be taken when interpreting our findings to inform decision-making in a different context or/and for a different population. A final limitation of the study relates to the COVID-19 pandemic. The trial was designed to last 12 months, but only the first 6 months of data was interpretable due to disruptions in the study\u2019s delivery relating to pandemic restrictions [14]. Future research might consider producing value sets or conducting mapping exercises to convert scores from MANSA and ReQoL instruments to health utilities in LMIC settings. Furthermore, we found limited research evidence on country-specific costeffectiveness thresholds in LMICs [36]. The empirical evidence and\nhttps://doi.org/10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.2310 Published online by Cambridge University Press\nmethodological research in this area are much needed. Finally, we did not find an agreed approach for estimating country-specific cost-effectiveness of an intervention inmulti-country clinical trials. Additional research is required in this area in order to inform policy makers regarding resource allocation decisions at the countryspecific level."
