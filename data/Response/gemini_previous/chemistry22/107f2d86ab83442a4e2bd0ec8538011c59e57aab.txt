1. **Investigate the use of other machine learning algorithms for predicting the biological activity and pharmacokinetic properties of compounds.** The authors used the MobileNetV3 deep convolutional neural network in this study, but other algorithms, such as support vector machines, random forests, or gradient boosting machines, could also be explored.


2. **Apply the proposed method to other diseases or drug targets.** The authors focused on breast cancer in this study, but their method could be applied to other diseases or drug targets. This would help to validate the generalizability of the method and its potential for use in drug discovery.


3. **Develop a more comprehensive dataset of compounds and their biological activity and pharmacokinetic properties.** The dataset used in this study was relatively small, which may have limited the accuracy of the prediction models. A larger dataset would help to improve the accuracy of the models and make them more useful for drug discovery.


4. **Investigate the use of the proposed method to design new drugs.** The authors used the proposed method to optimize the clinical properties of existing compounds, but it could also be used to design new drugs. This would involve using the prediction models to identify compounds with the desired biological activity and pharmacokinetic properties.


5. **Develop a software tool that implements the proposed method.** This would make the method more accessible to researchers and drug developers. The tool could be used to predict the biological activity and pharmacokinetic properties of compounds, optimize the clinical properties of existing compounds, and design new drugs.
