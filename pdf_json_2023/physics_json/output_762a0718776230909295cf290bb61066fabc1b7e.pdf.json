Single crystals of three different compositions (x = 0.73, 0.91, and 0.97) were successfully synthesized and suggested the\nexistence of a solid solution in the range 0.73 < x < 1. Through a detailed single crystal\ncharacterization, the complete structure of these compounds is determined, revealing a distinct B-\ntype hollandite-like structural form derived from the hollandite structure, in contrast to the more\ncommonly observed A-type pseudo-hollandite in AM5X8-type chalcogenides (A = cation, M = transition metal, X = chalcogen). Periodic density functional theory calculations predict the\nCs0.73Cr5Te8 composition as the most stable one with a metallic conductive behavior. The thermal conductivity of bulk CsxCr5Te8 samples is measured to be 1.4 W.m-1.K-1 at 300 K and increases with temperature up to 2 W.m-1.K-1 at 673 K."

            "text": "Transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) have been extensively studied for their wide range of properties and potential applications, including superconductivity,1 optoelectronics,2,3 photocatalysis,4 and energy storage.5 One of the key factors contributing to their diverse properties is their complex structural diversity, which often manifests as low-dimensional arrangements.6,7\nThese structures can be characterized by the presence of two-dimensional (2D) sheets or one-\ndimensional (1D) infinite channels, often featuring spacious voids as observed in compounds like AgCrSe2 8,9 or Nb3Se4.10 Such structural features are particularly attractive in the field of thermoelectricity where a very low thermal conductivity is required.11 Indeed, the lattice\ncomponent (kl) of the thermal conductivity is primarily governed by phonon scattering which is generally large in highly complex structures.12,13 Consequently, an efficient strategy to reach low\nthermal conductivity is to aim at synthesizing low-dimensional structures containing large scattering centers in order to reduce effectively the phonon mean free path.14\u201318 This is the case for instance of the chromium chalcogenide compounds TlxCr5Se815 and Ba0.5Cr5Se8,16 which exhibit remarkably low thermal conductivities of 0.7 W.m-1.K-1 and 0.8 W.m-1.K-1 at 300 K, respectively.\nMotivated by these findings, we have conducted a complete study on related compounds\npossessing similar structural features, with the aim of exploring their potential in thermoelectric\napplications.\nThe two aforementioned compounds belong to the family of hollandite derivatives materials,\ncharacterized by the general formula AM5X8 (A = Li\u2013Cs, Sr, Ba, Cd, In, Tl, Sn, and Pb; M = Sc, Ti, V, Cr; and X = S, Se, Te).14\u201341 The structure of these compounds is somewhat related to that of the hollandite mineral oxide BaMn8O16. First described by Bystr\u00f6m and Bystr\u00f6m,42 the hollandite structure consists of interconnected chains of MnO6 octahedra, where the chains share corners,\nforming a quasi-one-dimensional framework. This arrangement gives rise to two distinct channels\nalong the same axis direction. Barium cations, sitting in the largest channels, counterbalance the\ncharge of the anionic framework and stabilize the structure (Figure 1a).\noctahedra corresponding to equivalent Cr1, Cr2 and Cr3 chromium atoms are depicted in blue, red and green, respectively. The same color scheme is used for all hollandite and hollandite derivatives structures to emphasize their related structural features. The size of the chalcogenide atoms is reduced for clarity.\nPseudo-hollandite compounds, such as TlCr5Se8,20 derive from this parent hollandite mineral. Their structure involves the stacking of two dimensional CdI2-like layers, where MX6 octahedra share edges. These layers are interconnected by double chains of edge- and face-sharing MX6 octahedra. The resulting framework forms large infinite channels along the monoclinic b-axis, with\nthe cation A located at the center. Consequently, the small channels formed by the empty\noctahedral sites at the intersection of the double chains are absent in the pseudo-hollandite\nstructure. These voids are filled with MX6 octahedra, forming a continuous two-dimensional layer. This feature explains the stoichiometry difference between hollandite and pseudo-hollandite\ncompounds. Furthermore, the filled octahedral sites involve face-sharing octahedra at the junction\nbetween the CdI2-type layers and define the mode of connection between each layer in these hollandite derivatives (Figure 1b).\nBoucher et al. demonstrated by investigating Rb0.73Cr5Te8 the existence of another structural type referred to as \"hollandite-like\", which also originates from the parent hollandite.35 This\nstructure is still built up from 2D layers of CrTe6 edge-sharing octahedra interconnected by pillaring double chains of face- and edge-sharing CrTe6 octahedra, resulting in the same chemical formula as pseudo-hollandites. However, the way in which the two-dimensional layers\ninterconnect differs. The \"hollandite-like\" structure can be described as a hollandite structure with\na CrTe6 octahedra occupying the octahedral voids present at the intersection of the double chains (Figure 1c). Yamazaki and Ueda32 confirmed the existence of this second structural \u2018hollandite-\nlike\u2019 arrangement and proposed the designations \"A-type\" for pseudo-hollandite compounds and\n\"B-type\" for the \"hollandite-like\" structures. This nomenclature is adopted in our study.\nIt is worth noting that among the extensive range of hollandite derivative compounds reported\nto date, only Rbx- and Csx-inserted chromium tellurides (x > 0.73) adopt the 'hollandite-like' Btype structure, while all others crystallize in the 'pseudo-hollandite' A-type structure. Furthermore,\ndeviations from stoichiometry are commonly observed in most of the hollandite derivatives, regardless of the A or B structure type.15\u201317,27,28,34,35,37,39,44\u201347 In the case of chromium tellurides,\nthe amount of A cations inside the channels influences the observed structural type and the\ndetermination of the tipping stoichiometry for the formation of one or the other structure type\nproves to be challenging. For instance, Rb0.62Cr5Te8 crystallizes in the A-type structure whereas Rb0.73Cr5Te8 adopts the B-type structure. Conversely, the non-stoichiometric chromium selenides Rb0.75Cr5Se8 and Cs0.76Cr5Se8 were reported to crystallize in the A-type structure.39 This suggests that the B structural type is favored by (i) extended channels formed by large anions such as tellurium and (ii) large size cations such as Rb and Cs. Consistently, Yamazaki and Ueda32 stated\nthat the larger the amount of Rb, the more favored the B-type structure. However, no detailed\nstructural determination was performed concerning the Cs-inserted chromium tellurides, nor the\ninfluence of the stoichiometric deviation on the structural features of these compounds. In this\nstudy, we report for the first time a complete crystal structure determination of a range of\nCsxCr5Te8 compounds (x = 0.73; 0.91; 0.97) synthesized as single crystals by two different routes. The impact of non-stoichiometry on the structural features is explored and compared through\nelectronic structure calculations and crystal structure determination, enabling a discussion on the\nstructural stability of specific compositions. Subsequently, the transport properties of these\ncompounds are assessed and compared with those of other compounds."

            "text": "Synthesis and Preparation. Single crystals of CsxCr5Te8 with different compositions were grown using the self-flux method in fused silica tubes. The series of compounds was synthesized using\ntwo different routes. On the one hand, Cs0.73Cr5Te8 and Cs0.97Cr5Te8 single crystals were obtained by loading the CsCr5Te8 nominal composition from Cs2CO3 (powder, 99.9%), Cr (powder, 99.9%), and Te (shots, 99.999%) reagents under Ar atmosphere in a fused silica tube. After the\ntubes were flame-sealed under dynamic vacuum, temperature was raised to 500 \u00b0C over 8 hours,\nthen to 800 \u00b0C over 8 hours and kept constant for 48 hours. Samples were then cooled to 200 \u00b0C\nover 8 days. On the other hand, Cs0.91Cr5Te8 single crystals were grown from a different Cs precursor. CsTe4 was first synthesized in a niobium tube by mixing appropriate amounts of Cs (metal, 99.8%) and Te (shots, 99.999%) within a glovebox. The niobium tube was then sealed\nunder high purity argon within an arc furnace set up and placed inside a fused silica tube which\nwas subsequently flame-sealed under dynamic vacuum. The sample was then heated over 10 hours\nat 300 \u00b0C for 96 hours, and cooled to room temperature over 10 hours. Mixture of CsTe4, Cr (powder, 99.9%), and Te (shots, 99.999%) were loaded in a fused silica tube with the CsCr5Te8 nominal composition and sealed in a similar manner. The temperature was raised to 500 \u00b0C over\n8 hours and kept constant for 8 hours. After this plateau, temperature was raised again over 8 hours\nat 800 \u00b0C and maintained for 24 hours, before cooling down the sample to 200 \u00b0C over a period of\n96 hours. Black metallic-like needles were obtained by both synthesis routes.\nBulk samples of CsxCr5Te8 were prepared by mixing Cs2CO3 (powder, 99.9%), Cr (powder, 99.9%), and Te (shots, 99.999%) in a glovebox with appropriate amounts to obtain the Cs0.73Cr5Te8 stoichiometry. The mixture was introduced in a 65-cm3 stainless steel jar with two balls (\u00d8 12.6\nmm) and underwent a run of 10 hours under argon atmosphere in a vibratory ball milling\nequipment (SPEX). The obtained powder was subsequently sintered by Spark Plasma Sintering\n(SPS) at 700 \u00b0C and the densified pellet was annealed at 700 \u00b0C during 24 hours. The relative\ndensity of the densified bulk material was 96 %. Powder X-ray diffraction pattern refinement was carried out by the Le Bail method using the Fullprof Suite,48 yielding Rp = 11.3 %, Rwp = 15.3 % and \u03c7\u00b2 = 1.81 agreement factors (14 parameters). Thermal conductivity measurements were\nperformed under N2 atmosphere using a Netzsch 467 HyperFlash Laser-Flash Apparatus (LFA) on 10-mm diameter and 1-mm thick sample coated with graphite. Heat capacity was estimated\naccording to the Dulong-Petit law and density was measured by the Archimede method in high\npurity ethanol.\nSingle Crystal Characterization. Single crystals of appropriate size for X-ray investigation were\npicked up in air and isolated in silicon oil, before being loaded on the goniometric head of a four-\ncircle Rigaku XtaLAB Synergy-S diffractometer equipped with a molybdenum radiation source (\u03bbMo = 0.71073 \u00c5). The CrysAlis-Pro software49 was used to analyze the collected data. Threedimensional peak hunting was made before the subsequent data reduction corrected for absorption.\nOnly reflections with I > 3\u03c3(I) were used for the charge-flipping structure resolution from SUPERFLIP50 alongside the following refinement performed with Jana2006 software.51 All\nparameters were refined with an instability factor of 0.025. Atomic displacement parameters\n(ADP) were refined anisotropically.\nElectronic Structure Calculations. Periodic spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT)\ncalculations were carried out in order to gain insight into the structural and electronic properties\nof the CsxCr5Te8 phases. Geometry optimizations were first performed on the stoichiometric CsCr5Te8 and non-stoichiometric Cs0.75Cr5Te8 compounds using the Vienna ab initio Simulation\n(VASP) code,52\u201354 with the Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernzerhof (PBE) functional.55 VASP-relaxed structures\nwere then used to compute the electronic density of states (DOS) with the WIEN2k code using the full-potential linearized augmented plane wave (FLAPW) approach,56 employing the modified Becke-Johnson (mBJ) exchange-correlation potential.57"

All CsxCr5Te8 compounds (x = 0.73, 0.91, 0.97) were found to adopt the hollandite-like B-type structure with the space group C2/m (Figure 1c). Initially,\nthe structures were solved by structure visualization, assuming a stoichiometric composition of\nCsCr5Te8 based on the nominal composition. However, akin to the structure resolution of Rb0.73Cr5Te8 conducted by Gareh et al.,34 Fourier difference maps revealed large electronic residues on the Cs 2a site, accompanied by high atomic displacement parameters. These\nobservations suggested a possible deviation from stoichiometry, similar to RbxCr5Te8 compounds (x = 0.5, 0.62, and 0.73).32,34,35 Subsequent refinement of the Cs site occupancy significantly\nreduced the electronic residues and improved the reliability factors for all crystals.

The cells\nparameters of all compounds, except \u03b2, show a linear-like evolution with the increase of the b axis\nand a decrease of the a and c axes upon an increasing amount of Cs (Figure 2). This supports the\nexistence of a solid solution ranging from the Cs0.73Cr5Te8 composition \u2013 identical to that observed for the B-type Rb0.73Cr5Te8 \u2013 to the almost completely filled Cs0.97Cr5Te8 composition. The decrease of a and c cell parameters with the Cs amount is caused by a slight distortion of the CrTe6 octahedra in the vicinity of the Cs inserted cations, contracting the cell along these axis directions.\nThis is illustrated by the increased distances between Cs and Te atoms as well as Te-Te distances\nin the channels (Te3 and Te4) (Table 2). On the other hand, the increase of b stems from the\nincrease of the Cs-Cs distances upon Cs insertion inside the channels and gives rise to an increased\ncell volume overall. Between compositions x = 0.73 and x = 0.91, the cell volume experiences a\n0.66% increase. While the cell volumes of the highly Cs-filled compositions (x = 0.91 and x = 0.97) are closely similar (753.70(16) and 752.74(12) \u00c53, respectively), the slight decrease observed\nwith increasing Cs content can be attributed to a further contraction of the unit cell along the a and\nc axes.\nThe atomic displacement parameters (ADPs) of the investigated compounds show notable\ncharacteristics. Indeed, the anisotropic ADP U22 along the b axis is significantly larger in Cs0.73Cr5Te8 compared to the higher Cs-filled chromium tellurides (0.0853(5), 0.0347(5), 0.0246(2) \u00c52 for x = 0.73, 0.91, and 0.97, respectively). This observation clearly indicates a high\ndegree of disorder in the Cs distribution within the channels of the non-stoichiometric Cs0.73Cr5Te8 compound. In contrast, the channel axis-oriented Cs ADP U22 rapidly decreases for Cs0.91Cr5Te8 and becomes similar to other directional ADPs in Cs0.97Cr5Te8, suggesting an isotropic ADP and reduced cationic disorder for the nearly fully occupied CsxCr5Te8 compound. These findings are\nconsistent with the highly anisotropic ADP observed for the inserted cations in other nonstoichiometric hollandite derivatives,28,39,44 including the B-type Rb0.73Cr5Te8.34\nStability of the B Structural Type. A noteworthy feature of the B-type structure, adopted by\nall investigated CsxCr5Te8 compositions, is the interaction between Cr atoms from the octahedra situated at the intersection between the layers and the pillaring double chain of octahedra (Figure\n3). As previously mentioned, the distinction between the A- and B-types is the configuration of the\nface-sharing bridging double chain of octahedra between the CrTe2 sheets positioned in the ab plane. In the A-type structure exemplified by Rb0.62Cr5Te8, the junction consists of two distinct face-sharing octahedra (depicted in red in Figure 3) originating from the CrTe2 layer, resulting in two Cr2\u2013Cr3 pairs of Cr\u2013Cr interactions. Conversely, in the B-type structure, only one octahedron\n(represented in blue in Figure 3) is involved in the face-sharing octahedra junction with the upper\nand lower pillaring double chains. As a consequence, a linear three-atom chain Cr3\u2013Cr1\u2013Cr3 is\nformed in this structure type, with shorter Cr\u2013Cr distances compared to the A-type structure. For\ninstance, Cr\u2013Cr distances in A-type Rb0.62Cr5Te8 are somewhat longer than in B-type Rb0.73Cr5Te8: 3.161(2) \u00c5 and 3.069(2) \u00c5, respectively. As the preparative conditions were invoked to synthesize either A- or B-type Rb-inserted RbxCr5Te8,34 no occurrence of any A-type CsxCr5Te8 compound was found in our work, regardless of the synthesis routes.\nFollowing the discussion of Boucher, Gareh and co-workers,34,35 the weakly antibonding nature\nof the Cr\u2013Cr interactions must explain the slight off-centering of the chromium atoms within their\nrespective octahedra, as they somewhat repel each other. In the case of the A-type structure, the\noctahedra junction arrangement does not impose significant geometric restrictions on the\nchromium atoms, allowing them to have more freedom to repulse each other. However, this is not\nthe case in the B-type structure, where the octahedron formed by Cr1 shares two faces with upper\nand lower pillaring octahedra, thereby restricting the freedom of Cr1 despite the antibonding nature\nof its interaction with both the upper and lower Cr3 atoms. This crucial observation helps to\nelucidate why the B-type hollandite-like structure is not as commonly stabilized compared to the\nmuch more frequently encountered A-type pseudo-hollandites.\nIn the case of CsxCr5Te8 compounds reported in this work, the Cr\u2013Cr distances are all longer than in Rb0.73Cr5Te8. In particular, the Cr\u2013Cr distance reaches 3.1037(3) \u00c5 in Cs0.73Cr5Te8 to be compared to the somewhat shorter one (3.069(2) \u00c5) in Rb0.73Cr5Te8. It appears that this Cr\u2013Cr distance decreases with increasing Cs content, with values of 3.101(2) \u00c5 and 3.0925(6) \u00c5 for\nCs0.91Cr5Te8 and Cs0.97Cr5Te8, respectively. As the Cr\u2013Cr interaction is overall weakly antibonding, the longer the Cr\u2013Cr distance, the more stable the compound is expected to be. Hence,\nCs0.73Cr5Te8 should be more stable than higher Cs-filled chromium tellurides.\nPeriodic density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out on stoichiometric\nCsCr5Te8 and non- stoichiometric Cs0.75Cr5Te8 compounds in order to elucidate their electronic and conducting properties. The computed total and Cs and Cr atom-projected spin-polarized electronic DOS are sketched in Figure 4. As discussed before for the RbxCr5Te8 phases,35 spin-up and spin-down total and atom projected DOS strongly differ, suggesting magnetic properties\nwhich, unfortunately, have never been confirmed experimentally up to now. Interestingly, a favorable semiconducting behavior is computed for the stoichiometric CsCr5Te8 (Cs+[Cr5Te8]\u2013) composition \u2013 this is almost reached for CsxCr5Te8 with x = 0.97 \u2013 with a strong participation of the Cr atoms and hardly any participation of the Cs cations. However, Boucher et al. have shown that for the RbxCr5Te8 phases,35 Rb vacancies were expected to lower the Fermi level and to depopulate Cr\u2013Cr non-bonding and antibonding states, favoring the structural stability of non-\nstoichiometric RbxCr5Te8 phases. The same situation occurs here for the non-stoichiometric CsxCr5Te8 compounds, i.e., partial depopulation of antibonding Cr\u2013Cr states which enable to\nsomewhat stabilize the structure. As a consequence, the compounds are expected to show metallic\nproperties with the Fermi level positioned in a substantial peak of DOS. It is interesting to mention\nthat the interactions between chromium atoms appear to be crucial for the stabilization of B-type hollandite-like, as neither the stoichiometric RbSc5Te8,41 CsSc5Te858 nor CsTi5Te840 compounds have been reported to crystallize in this structural form.\nthat the optimal preparative conditions for Cs0.73Cr5Te8 and CsCr5Te8 are highly similar, rendering difficult the control of the stoichiometry. Low-intensity reflections could be attributed to an unfilled Cr5Te8 impurity (space group P3\"m). However, since Cr5Te8 exhibits metallic behavior,59 as expected for CsxCr5Te8 as well, the presence of this impurity in the bulk is not believed to have a significant impact on the transport properties. It should be noted that the densified specimen\nshowed sensitivity to oxidation and humidity, resulting in its degradation after a few days under\nambient conditions. Nevertheless, thermal conductivity measurements were successfully\nperformed on the sample before degradation occurred.\nThermal Conductivity Measurements. The temperature-dependent evolution of the thermal\nconductivity of the CsxCr5Te8 specimen is presented Figure 6. As depicted, the thermal conductivity increases from 1.4 W.m-1.K-1 at room temperature to approximately 2 W.m-1.K-1 at\n673 K. In comparison with hollandite selenide derivatives, these values fall within an intermediate\nrange. Specifically, they are lower than those measured for TlV5Se8, which shows a similar behavior but with values ranging from 2.5 to 3.3 W.m-1.K-1 in the same temperature range.\nConversely, CsxCr5Te8 values are substantially higher than that of other A-type pseudo-hollandite AxM5Se8 compounds (A = Ba, Tl, M = Cr, In), exhibiting thermal conductivities below 1 W.m1.K-1. The difference is attributed to a higher electronic thermal conductivity due to the metallic character in the compounds TlV5Se818 and CsxCr5Te8.\nAssuming an approximate lattice thermal conductivity of 0.8 W.m-1.K-1 for chromium hollandite derivatives of this kind,16 the expected resistivity for CsxCr5Te8 using the Wiedemann-Franz law and the standard Lorenz factor for metals (L0 = 2.44\u00b710-8 J2.K-2.C-2) would be around \u03c1 = 1.2 m\u03a9.cm at 300 K. This resistivity value is comparable to the reported value of \u03c1 = 0.45 m\u03a9.cm measured for highly conductive TlV5Se8 at the same temperature.18 It is worth mentioning, however, that Yamazaki and Ueda reported a value of \u03c1 ~ 1\u00b710\u00b2 m\u03a9.cm for ACr5Te8 (A = K, Rb, Cs) at 300 K.32 Furthermore, considering that the lattice thermal conductivity is expected to\nslightly decrease with temperature, the increase observed for the total thermal conductivity\nsuggests a significant rise in the electronic contribution upon increasing temperature. Assuming a\nrise in resistivity with temperature, which is consistent with a metallic conductive behavior, this\nobservation suggests a dominant temperature-dependent electronic thermal conductivity\ncontribution over that of resistivity, resulting in a gradual increase in resistivity with temperature.\nHowever, that eventuality must be confirmed through direct resistivity measurements.\nThe title compounds show a substantial sensitivity to oxidation and moisture, degrading after a\nfew days under ambient conditions. Therefore, it did not allow us to measure the resistivity and\nSeebeck coefficient. The latter is expected to be quite low, similar to TlV5Se8, given the metallic character of these compounds."

All compositions were found to crystallize in the hollandite-like B-type structural form. A detailed crystallographic\ninvestigation showed unambiguously that the presence of Cs atoms inside the channels helps in\nstabilizing the B-type structure. Density functional theory calculations performed on Cs0.75Cr5Te8 indicated that the non-stoichiometric ACr5Te8 compounds (A = Rb, Cs) should be metallic in character with hardly any participation of the alkaline element around the Fermi level. A\nsubstantial electronic thermal conductivity can then be expected. As a result, due to an enhanced\nparticipation of charge carriers in the thermal transport mechanism, the presence of Cs cations\nwithin the channels does not result in a reduction of thermal conductivity compared to that of other\nA-type hollandite derivative compounds.\nAUTHOR INFORMATION"
