            "text": "The first reported IR-induced reaction was described by Hall and Pimentel almost 60 years ago [1]. In that pioneer experiment, the authors isolated nitrous acid in an argon matrix and used broadband infrared excitation in the OH stretching wavenumber region (3650-3200 cm\u20131) to induce changes in the relative populations of the two conformers of the molecule (Figure 1). The conformational changes were found to depend on the specific wavenumber range applied to irradiate the sample, which could be chosen by using appropriate infrared bandpass filters. In their article, Hall and Pimentel pointed out that \u201cthe [observed] IR-induced isomerization of nitrous acid can be considered to be a new type of photochemical reaction\u201d and stressed the fact that the \u201cstudy of this reaction [was] possible only because of the unique potentialities of the matrix isolation technique\u201d [1]. They appropriately concluded that \u201cperhaps the most important [result] in this work is the implied high efficiency of intramolecular energy transfer among the vibrational degrees of freedom of a vibrationally excited molecule\u201d [1]. Very interestingly, at the time, the discovery of Hall and Pimentel was not received so enthusiastically by the scientific community as it could be expected considering its highly innovative character. The main reason for that was the lack of selectivity of the observed process. In fact, upon broadband excitation both conformers were being simultaneously excited, so that their final populations resulted from the attainment of\na photostationary state. A photostationary state is a function of the applied excitation wavenumber range and, in that way, some control of the system can be achieved. Nevertheless, it was clear that to accomplish full control of this type of reactions and make the approach useful for application to other systems, selective excitation of a single specific conformer had to be made possible.\nThis problem was only solved 34 years later, when infrared narrowband tunable light sources became more easily available. In 1997, Pettersson, Lundell, Khriahtchev and R\u00e4s\u00e4nen, at the University of Helsinki, published a major breakthrough study [2] where the selective conformational isomerization of formic acid isolated in an argon matrix was successfully induced by narrowband excitation with a laserbased IR tunable light source. The most stable Z conformer of formic acid (O=C\u2013O\u2013H dihedral: 0o) was initially trapped in the a.CQC-IMS, Department of Chemistry, University of Coimbra, 3004-535 Coimbra, Portugal. b.Department of Physics, Faculty of Sciences and Letters, Istanbul Kultur University, 34158 Bakirkoy, Istanbul, Turkey. * Corresponding author (e-mail: rfausto@ci.uc.pt).\nPage 2 of 50Ch mical Society Reviews"

This first investigation was followed by others where the Z \u2192 E conformational conversion of formic acid was investigated in further details [3-10]. In those studies, isotopically labelled formic acid and different types of matrices were used. Our group had the chance to join those pioneer investigations since the very beginning. The studies were promptly expanded to other simple carboxylic and dicarboxylic acids, like acetic, oxalic, fumaric, maleic and malonic acids [7,11-15]. From our fruitful collaboration with the Helsinki group (and also in result of the work of other groups participating in this adventure) some general conclusions emerged, which became the basis for the subsequent more elaborated studies on more complex systems, like amino acids, nucleic acid bases, halogenated carboxylic acids, -hydroxyl, -keto and ,-unsaturated carboxylic acids, aromatic and other cyclic carboxylic acids, and phenol derivatives [16-47], among others. One very interesting early observation was that the IR excitation of a matrix isolated compound can be selective to the nature of the matrix sites occupied by the molecules [5]. In a matrix, molecules might be trapped in different local environments (matrix sites). Molecules in different matrix sites feel different intermolecular potentials due to the different interactions with the matrix atoms, this leading to slightly different intramolecular potentials. Therefore, the vibrational spectra of identical molecules trapped in different sites differ slightly. In practice, this leads to observation of bands in the spectrum of a given compound that appear split. It shall be noticed that not all bands have to show matrix splitting, since this depends upon the degree of perturbation of the intramolecular potential associated to each vibrational coordinate in result of the intermolecular interactions. In general, vibrational coordinates associated with more polar groups are more affected by the matrix medium and the corresponding bands appear more frequently split due matrix effects. For simple carboxylic acids, this is the case of, for example, the OH and C=O stretching modes. For formic acid, it was found that the molecules may occupy two main sites in an argon matrix, which give rise to OH fundamental bands at 3548.2 (site 1) and 3550.5 cm\u20131 (site 2) [5]. The corresponding 1st overtone bands are observed at 6930.3 and 6934.8 cm\u20131 [5]. As shown in Figure 2, excitation of molecules trapped in a given matrix site at the wavenumber of the corresponding OH 1st overtone results in the Z \u2192 E conformational conversion, without affecting in a measurable way the structure of the site. This means that, besides being selective to the molecular species (e.g., a given conformer of a given molecule), the reactions resulting from vibrational excitation are also selective regarding the local matrix trapping environment. As it will be shown later in this article, such selectivity is also kept when the energy delivered to the reactant conformer is substantially higher than that corresponding to excitation to a OH stretching 1st overtone, i.e., when excitation is performed, for example, at the characteristic wavenumbers of higher-order overtones of this vibration. Figure 2. Results of narrowband IR irradiation at the OH 1st overtone wavenumbers of the Z conformer of formic acid molecules isolated in two different matrix sites in an argon matrix, leading to its conversion into the E isomer. The bottom spectrum is that of the as-deposited matrix, while the middle and upper spectra are difference spectra obtained by subtracting the bottom spectrum to those obtained after the performed irradiations. Adapted from ref. 5. Copyright 2003 Elsevier. Another fascinating observation resulting from the very first series of studies with narrowband selective vibrational excitation was that the mechanism of energy redistribution from the excited coordinate to the reactive coordinate (in the case of the conformational isomerization of formic acid this latter is the low energy C\u2013O torsional coordinate) is not strictly statistical, implying that there are preferred channels which maximize the efficiency of the process. One simple proof for this is the observation of very similar efficiencies in the IR-induced isomerization processes of molecules having significantly different numbers of potentially competitive acceptor lowenergy coordinates, e.g. formic acid and cytosine [2,6,45]. The existence of such funnel-like preferential energy relaxation channels was demonstrated for the case of matrix isolated formic acid using time-resolved IR spectroscopy [48]. In the context of the present article, however, the most relevant observation extracted from the initial studies on IR-induced processes in cryogenic matrices was the fact that the conformational isomerization reactions may take place even when the energy deposited in the excited coordinate stays below that of the barrier separating the reactant conformer from the product. This was first observed for formic acid [6], and immediately after for acetic acid [49], but it is a rather general phenomenon. As shown in Figure 3, the quantum yields for the Z \u2192 E conformational conversion in both formic and acetic acids reduce by only one to two orders of magnitude once the excitation energy stays below but close to that corresponding to the energy barrier of the reaction, and only diminish considerably when the excitation is performed at an energy far from that of the energy barrier. The significant quantum yields of the reaction for excitation at energies below the barrier are easily explained taking into account its occurrence via the quantum mechanical tunneling (QMT) mechanism.

These reactions are designated as vibrationally-assisted QMTdriven reactions.\nIt is worth noticing that the quantum yields for the reaction of acetic acid were found to be systematically lower than those observed for formic acid [49], a result that is in agreement with the existence in the former molecule of an alternative energy relaxation channel efficiently competing with the reactive channel (as already mentioned, the torsion around the C\u2013O bond that leads to the Z \u2192 E conformational conversion). Such secondary relaxation channel has as final acceptor coordinate the low-energy internal rotation of the methyl group of acetic acid [49]. An additional observation resulting from the studies performed on the simple carboxylic acids first investigated was that the higher energy E conformers (formed upon vibrational excitation of the most stable Z conformers) spontaneously decay back to the original species in the dark via a tunneling-driven process. For formic acid isolated in argon, such tunneling process has a rate of ca. 2 x 10\u20133 s\u20131, which corresponds to a half-live of the E form of a few minutes [5]. The nature of the mechanism involved in these reactions was since the very beginning proved unequivocally through experiments with isotopically labelled formic and acetic acids [5,6,49], and this has been confirmed later for other types of molecules containing the carboxylic group (e.g., amino acids and halogenated carboxylic acids [16- 19,35-41]). The relevance of spontaneous QMT decay of higherenergy conformers produced in situ in matrices (using either vibrational or electronic excitation of suitable precursors) has also been demonstrated for other types of conformational isomerizations involving movement of hydrogen atoms, for\nexample in derivatives of nucleic acid bases and phenols [30,42- 47]. As noticed above, the matrix isolation method provides optimal conditions for direct observation of QMT. The very low work temperatures characteristic of a matrix isolation experiment (typically of a few Kelvin) prevent occurrence of any spontaneous over-the-barrier reaction that has an associated barrier higher than a few kJ mol\u20131. Under these conditions, observation of a spontaneous reaction usually implies that it takes place by tunneling. Since tunneling from the ground vibrational state implies that the reaction product has a lower energy than the reactant, it is easy to understand why vibrational excitation is particularly suitable to allow for observation of tunneling reactions: in one side, one can shift the state of the reactant to a higher vibrational state and open the gate for tunneling to products otherwise inaccessible and, on the other side, a higher energy species can be first generated as a result of the vibrational excitation of the reactant followed by energy relaxation, and subsequently undergo a tunnelingdriven reaction to the final product. In the latter case, the final product can either be the original reactant, as in the cases described above for formic and acetic acids, or a completely different species, as it will be here shown later. In this way, in a certain perspective one can state that IR-induced chemistry and QMT are, under matrix isolation conditions, very often entangled processes. The interesting point is that one can take advantage of this intertwining to strategically play with the structure of molecules, as it will be demonstrated in the next sections. It shall also be highlighted at this point that recent studies of QMT in cryogenic matrices have been providing evidence that this phenomenon shall not be considered only as a complementary mechanism to kinetics and thermodynamics in explaining chemical reactivity. QMT can in fact even determine the reactivity of a chemical species, superseding the classical rules of thermodynamics and kinetics and emerging as a new paradigm in chemical reactivity [50,51]. Figure 4 exemplifies how this can be conceived. In the top panel of the figure, a potential energy profile for two competitive reactions of A, to give products B and C, is presented. B corresponds to the thermodynamically driven product of lowest energy, while C is the result of kinetical control, generated via a lower energy transition state. Tunneling can also be considered to take place for generation of both B and C, and in matrix isolation conditions even dominate or occur exclusively (depending on the barrier heights and widths), but whatever the situation would be in this case tunneling does not lead to a new product. On the other hand, the potential energy profile shown in the bottom panel of Figure 4 is considerably more interesting, and it is exemplified for a real example [50,52]. In this case, the 1,2- methyl shift product of rearrangement of tert-butylchlorocarbene is both the thermodynamics and kinetics determined product, since it has the lowest energy among the possible products and can be reached via the lowest energy transition state. However, after in situ generation of the reactant carbene in a cryogenic N2 matrix (at 11 K), this putative product was not experimentally observed [52]. Instead, the C\u2013H bond insertion\nPage 4 of 50Ch mical Society Reviews"

Another paradigmatic example of tunneling control of chemical reactivity has been reported recently by Shreiner, involving the rearrangement of matrix isolated methylhydoxycarbene [50,51].\nBefore starting to provide relevant examples to illustrate the progress on the investigation of IR-induced and tunnelingdriven reactions observed in cryogenic matrices in a historical perspective, which will be the subject of the next sections of this article, it appears appropriate to present here the main reasons why vibrationally-induced chemistry is so appealing. The main reason for this is because a laser can be tuned to the vibrational frequency of a specific bond and used to deposit sufficient energy to cleave that bond while leaving the remaining part of the molecule practically undisturbed. This is a very much different situation compared to thermally- or UV-induced processes, where extensive changes are made to the structure of the whole molecule. Using a simple comparison, IR-induced processes are the equivalent of a laparoscopic surgery, where\nthe target organ is reached with minimum damage of the body, in opposition to a strongly invasive open-abdominal surgery, which in this comparison is the equivalent of both thermal and UV-induced reactions. Additionally, IR excitation may be used to change the structure of the molecule, in a very specific and localized way, to open new reaction channels, as illustrated, for example, in the decomposition reaction of diazomethane depicted in Figure 5. In this case, selective vibrational excitation of the CNN anti-symmetric stretching fundamental of the molecule was performed [53], which took the molecule to a vibrational state where the path to the cleavage of the CN bond via CH2 bending became accessible.\nAnother interesting possibility opened by IR-induced chemistry results from the fact that conformers can be produced in a very selective way, including conformers of high-energy otherwise not accessible to experimentation. This allows for conformationally selective chemistry to be investigated. The UV-induced photodegradation of formic acid is a good example of conformationally dependent reactivity of a compound [4], but other examples have also been reported [54-57]. Formic acid has only two conformers and they were found to have distinct preferential photodegradation pathways (Figure 6). After isolation in a cryogenic matrix of the most stable Z conformer, UV irradiation results mostly in the production of CO + H2O. On the other hand, in situ generation of the higher energy E conformer, upon vibrational excitation of the initially deposited Z form, allowed for the investigation of its photochemistry, which was shown to preferentially yield H2 + CO2 [4]. In the next sections, the major developments resulting from the above-mentioned initial experiments on IR-induced chemistry and interconnected tunneling-driven reactions will be presented, following closely our involvement in the field for more than 30 years. We will focus mostly on our own work, but many other groups have also been given outstanding\nPage 5 of 50 Ch mical Society Reviews"

The story here presented is necessarily an incomplete story. Nevertheless, it considers a large range of examples, from very selective IR-induced conformational isomerizations to successful observations of rare heavy atom tunneling processes, and it provides a rather general overview of most of the major progresses achieved in the field.\nFrom simple 2-states systems to complex multistates systems: on the route of generalization The first IR-induced studies focused on simple molecules exhibiting two conformational states, with particular emphasis on formic and acetic acids [2-6,49]. Our already classic study on propionic acid (in collaboration with the Helsinki group) [66] appeared as a landmark in the field, bringing the technique to the investigation of a molecule with a larger number of relevant conformers. Propionic acid has two conformers of low energy, where the carboxylic group is in the Z conformation (Z-syn and Z-skew\u00b1), and two conformers of higher energy, where the carboxylic group is in the E conformation (E-syn and E-skew\u00b1). Figure 7 shows the structures of the conformers and the energy barriers for their interconversion, as predicted theoretically.\nConsidering their high relative energy, the E conformers have a negligible population in gas phase, so that it could be expected that only the two Z conformers should be observed experimentally. Interestingly, it was found that the most stable Z-syn conformer was exclusively present in the as-deposited matrices of the compound [66]. The absence of the Z-skew\u00b1 conformer in the initially prepared matrices is, however, easy to understand. This conformer is separated from the most stable form by a very small energy barrier (0.72 kJ mol\u20131, as predicted at the MP2/6-311++G(2d,2p) level [66]). This barrier is then easily surpassed at the time the molecules, initially in a hot gaseous beam, land onto the optical substrate (a CsI window cooled to 15 K) during deposition of the matrix. Consequently, the higher-energy Z-skew\u00b1 conformer converts into the most stable Z-syn form. This phenomenon (known by conformational cooling effect) is well-known and has been observed many times in matrix isolation experiments for molecules with conformers separated by energy barriers of only a few kJ mol\u20131 [67-69]. The fact that just the Z-syn conformer is present in the asdeposited matrices of propionic acid is interesting, since this allows for the study of its properties and reactivity in an easy way. The vibrational excitation of this conformer at the wavenumber of its OH stretching 1st overtone (6960 cm\u20131) was found to generate both the high-energy E-syn conformer, via rotation around the C\u2013O bond, and the Z-skew\u00b1 conformer, through rotation about the C\u2013C bond. The latter conformer, once produced in situ, is rather stable under matrix isolation conditions at the lowest temperatures used (8 K), because now no energy is available to efficiently surpass the Z-skew\u00b1 \u2192 Z-syn barrier. On the other hand, the E-syn conformer decays quickly back to the Z-syn conformer by tunneling, since this reaction involves only motion of the light carboxylic hydrogen atom (this is in fact a similar process to those observed in formic and acetic acids described above). Hence, not just the E-syn and Z-skew\u00b1 conformers could be prompted identified and characterized vibrationally [66], but these experiments opened the possibility for the study of their specific reactivities. Since the initially produced Z-skew\u00b1 conformer is stable under the experimental conditions used, a subsequent IR-irradiation at the wavenumber of its OH stretching 1st overtone (6950 cm\u20131) could be undertaken. In result of such irradiation, this conformer was converted into the highest-energy E-skew\u00b1 conformer, thus generating the last of the 4 conformers of propionic acid (this conformer also decays in the dark, by QMT, to the most stable conformer) [66]. The whole series of experiments performed on propionic acid is summarized in Figure 8 and illustrates well the power of the coordinated use of IR-induced chemistry and tunneling to manipulate chemical structures. The next example deals with an even more complex chemical system and shows how IRexcitation can be coupled not just with QMT but also with UVexcitation in a strategic way to achieve selective structural manipulations. The target compound in those studies was the nucleic acid base cytosine, and the investigations were performed within the scope of a broader program of research developed in collaboration with the group of Nowak and\nPage 6 of 50Ch mical Society Reviews"

These species are represented in Figure 9, which also summarizes the sequence of experiments we successfully undertook to change the relative amounts of the five forms in a cryogenic matrix [45- 47]. Upon deposition of cytosine in an argon matrix, the signatures of all the five isomers of cytosine depicted in Figure 9 were detected [45-47]. UV irradiation at 300 nm resulted in conversion of the AO form into the remaining species. In this way, the population of the minor imino-oxo isomers could be strongly enhanced. Subsequent irradiation at 311 nm led to interconversion between the IO1 and IO2 isomers. This is a typical reaction progressing toward a photostationary state and, when performed immediately after the irradiation at 300 nm that converts AO into both IO1 and IO2, results in effective conversion of IO1 into the higher energy IO2 isomer. This UV irradiation does not change the populations neither of AO nor of the AH1 and AH2 isomers. On the other hand, when the matrix is let in the dark, the AH2 form spontaneously decays by QMT to the most stable AH1 form, in a reaction obeying to a dispersive-type kinetics [47] with an average time constant of ca. 36.5 h. Selective interconversions between the two amino-hydroxy conformers could be achieved by IR excitation. Irradiation at 7013 cm\u22121 (OH 1st overtone of AH1) led to conversion of this form into AH2, whereas irradiation at 7034 cm\u22121 (OH 1st overtone of AH2) induced the opposite transformation [45]. It is worth mentioning that these studies were the first ever reported where IR-induced conformational isomerizations were\nsuccessfully achieved for a large heterocyclic molecule under matrix isolation conditions. In polyatomic molecules containing more than 10 atoms, the higher density of vibrational states could a priori be expected to strongly affect the pathways of vibrational energy redistribution, and hence the efficiency of the IR-induced conformational isomerizations. Nevertheless, the results proved that for cytosine the process occurs with an efficiency that is similar to those observed for small molecules like formic and acetic acid, and this was a clear experimental evidence of the existence of preferred channels for vibrational\nenergy redistribution.

Copyright 2011 Royal Society of Chemistry.\nAnother relevant development in the field was the use of selective IR excitations to generate rare high-energy dimers of carboxylic acids, showing that the method could also be applied for weakly bonded species. Formic and acetic acids are the paradigmatic examples of this type of studies. For both molecules a large number of unusual dimers was generated in cryogenic matrices upon vibrational excitation of more common dimeric species, and subsequently characterized structurally and spectroscopically [70,71]. The most interesting dimers of these two carboxylic acids that have been produced this way have at least one of their molecular units in the intrinsically less stable carboxylic E conformation. Since both E formic and acetic acid monomers are unstable in a cryogenic matrix, the E units of the dimer have to be generated in situ. Two different strategies have been applied: in the first, the E monomer of the acid is first produced by vibrational excitation of the Z form, and then the matrix is annealed to a higher temperature, allowing for molecular diffusion and formation of the dimers containing the E units (very interestingly, the E conformers were found to diffuse in the warmed matrices more efficiently than the Z forms, which facilitated the generation of E containing dimers [70,71]); in the second approach, the Z-Z dimers are first prepared from the Z monomer by warming the matrix and then the dimers are subjected to IR irradiation to convert them into dimers containing an E structural unit [70,71].\nPage 7 of 50 Ch mical Society Reviews"

In this example, note the selective character of the IR-induced process. Upon irradiation at the specific wavenumber of the OH 1st overtone of the free OH group of the Z-Z dimer D2 Z-Z, this species was converted to the D2 Z-E dimer, without any change taking place either for the Z monomer or for the Z-Z\ncentrosymmetric dimer D1 Z-Z present in the matrix.\nVibrational excitation via higher-order overtones: opening the gate to higher energy processes One limitation to the generalization of vibrational excitation as a tool for inducing chemical reactivity is the relatively small range of energies accessible. If excitation is undertaken using a fundamental vibration, in the most favorable case of pumping of the OH stretching mode, the energy introduced in the molecule is in the range of only 30\u201345 kJ mol\u20131 (3000-3600 cm\u20131). First overtone excitation expands the range of energy to 75-87 kJ mol\u20131 (6300\u20137300 cm\u20131), and this is enough energy to allow inducing quite efficiently many types of conformational isomerization processes. We asked ourselves about the possibility of using higher-order overtones to introduce even more energy in the molecules. If possible, excitation using the 2nd overtone of a OH stretching mode would allow to expand the range of processes energetically accessible to those having barriers as large as ca. 130 kJ mol\u20131. Though conceptually the idea is simple, there were some important questions to verify: (i) in order to choose the wavenumber to use for the excitation, the position of the 2nd overtone has to be determined, so that the corresponding band has to be experimentally observed; is\nthis possible using the conventional detectors for near-IR?; (ii) for the processes to be efficient, the IR absorption cross section of the mode to excite has to be as large as possible; is that of the OH 2nd overtone large enough?; (iii) since the width of the 2nd overtone bands can be expected to be larger than those of the fundamental bands or 1st overtones, can selectivity still be\nkept in a way that this can be useful in practical terms?; (iv) considering the higher energy introduced in the molecule, can the process still be selective also regarding the matrix site, or will it affect the nature of the sites? We noticed that for reliable observation of 2nd overtone bands of matrix isolated species the detection system of the FTIR spectrometer used for studies involving excitation of fundamentals or 1st overtones had to be improved. A thermoelectrically cooled indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs) detector was then installed in our equipment. With this detector, the bands due to OH stretching 2nd overtones are in general detectable. We also found that by appropriate choice of the excitation conditions (in particular the laser power), the absorption cross section of these vibrations is enough to guarantee efficiency of the IR-induced processes. For excitation, a continuous wave diode tunable near-IR laser system Toptica DLC TA PRO (spectral range: 10500\u201310100 cm\u20131; fwhm < 1 MHz, up to 3 W) was purchased and, in a typical experiment, irradiation shall be carried on during 20 min with at least 120 mW of power. Three structurally related molecules, hydroxyacetone, glycolic acid and glycolamide, were chosen as targets of the first\nPage 8 of 50Ch mical Society Reviews"

In all these cases, we were able to successfully induce conformational isomerizations upon excitation of the OH 2nd overtone. Figure 11 summarizes the results obtained for glycolamide, where the conversion of the Tt conformer into the Cc form is demonstrated. Interestingly, the process was shown to be site selective, allowing us to conclude that despite the higher energies involved compared to excitation of fundamentals and 1st overtone modes no measurable disturbance of the matrix sites takes place also\nupon excitation of the OH 2nd overtone.\nFigure 11. IR-induced conformational isomerization in glycolamine (GAm) in an argon matrix, as result of excitation of the OH 2nd overtone (3(OH)). Note the site selectivity of the process (A and B designate the two sites). Adapted from ref. 72. Copyright 2019 Royal Society of Chemistry.\nWe also noticed that, as anticipated, the widths of the OH 2nd overtone bands are in general larger than those of the bands ascribed to fundamental and 1st overtone modes (FWHM 6 cm\u22121 vs 3 cm\u22121 for acid OH group of most stable conformer of glycolic acid [72]). Nevertheless, they still allow for selective excitation to be performed in many cases, since the spacing between the absorption wavenumbers of the different conformers also tend to increase for the higher order overtones. Higher-order overtone (v = 6) excitation Raman studies on matrix isolated formic acid have been reported by Olbert-Majkut, Ahokas, Lundell and Pettersson, in studies where the E conformer was produced upon vibrational excitation of the Z conformer using visible light (532.0 nm, or 18797 cm\u22121, provided by a continuous laser highly-focused at the sample and a power level up to 260 mW). The laser light was used simultaneously for pumping and to collect the Raman\nspectra [73,74]. Interestingly, the authors suggested that much higher overtone states can also be used, opening the gate for UV-region vibrational overtone induced reactions [73]. We had not yet attempted to use excitations at overtones above the second in a systematic way in our laboratory. Indeed, we performed only a very preliminary series of experiments using visible light excitation of matrix isolated formic acid, with a ns pulsed light pumping source (at 532 nm) and IR spectroscopy probing to detect the formation of the E conformer, but these experiments resulted unsuccessful. One of the reasons for that was, much probably, the irradiation power at the sample provided by our irradiation system, which is much less than the 260 mW used in the Raman experiments of Olbert-Majkut and coworkers [73,74]. The feasibility and appropriateness of excitations to higher than the second overtone as a general strategy is not yet proved, at least when IR spectroscopy is used as probing technique, and this is a field that shall be considered still open to investigation.\nThe concept of vibrational antenna: remote control of molecular structures The first reported IR-induced structural transformations were limited to changes in the close proximity of the excited fragment of the molecule. Most of times, excitation of the OH stretching mode was used to modify the orientation of the hydroxyl hydrogen atom itself, as in the case of the Z \u2192 E conformational conversion of carboxylic acids. Less frequently, internal rotation around a C\u2013C bond vicinal to the excited hydroxyl group was observed, as in the cases of propionic acid and glycolamine described above [66,72], but also in other compounds like glycolic acid and hydroxyacetone, for example [25,72]. From the comparison of the quantum yields for the Z \u2192 E conformational conversion in formic and acetic acids, it could also be indirectly concluded that excitation of the OH stretching mode also induced internal rotation of the methyl group around the C\u2013C bond in the latter compound [49], as described in the introduction section. In 2015, we reported the first example of an IR-induced conformational isomerization of a fragment in a molecule that was remotely located from the excited group [75]. The target compound of these studies was 6-methoxy indole, which has two conformers of similar energy. By excitation of the NH stretching 1st overtone of the conformers, we were able to selectively interconvert them (Figure 12) [75]. The processes involve a structural transformation of a methoxy group located four bonds apart from the excited vibrational antenna and were found to be very efficient. Since this pioneer investigation, the concept of remote vibrational antenna has been explored in our group in several other systems, like the thiol forms of thioacetamide, kojic acid or E-glutaconic acid [76-78], for example. We have also shown that different antennas can be used in an interchangeable way to induce conformational changes in the same molecular fragment, as demonstrated in our studies on conformational changes of an aldehyde group\nPage 9 of 50 Ch mical Society Reviews"

The first example was reported in 2020 and considered the bidirectional thiol\u2194hydroxy tautomerization in thiotropolone [80]. Thiotropolone has two tautomers, the thiol and the hydroxy forms, each one having two conformers. As shown in Figure 13, the syn-hydroxy (s-OH-TT) form is the most stable species, followed by the syn-thiol isomer (s-SH-TT; 7.5 kJ mol\u20131 higher in energy than the most stable form), the anti-thiol form (a-SH-TT; 17.1 kJ mol\u20131), and the anti-hydroxy isomer (a-OH-TT; 51.6 kJ mol\u20131). In a freshly deposited argon matrix of the compound, only the s-OH-TT form is present. IR irradiation at the wavenumber of the CH stretching 1st overtone (5940 cm\u20131) or the combination mode at 5980 cm\u20131 of this isomer led to its conversion into the a-SH-TT form [80] (Figure 14). The reaction involves the cleavage of the O\u2013H bond and the formation of an S\u2013H bond. Very interestingly, the observed product is not the s-SH-TT form, which could be expected to be the direct product of the reaction, but a-SH-TT. The data shown in Figure 15 allows to understand the reasons for this observation.\nFigure 13.

Adapted from ref. 80. Copyright 2020 American Chemical Society.\nUpon excitation of s-OH-TT at 5980 or 5940 cm\u22121, ~71 kJ mol\u22121 are introduced in the molecule. Such energy is below the transition state (TS) for OH-rotamerization (~76 kJ mol\u22121), justifying the non-observation of the s-OH-TT \u2192 a-OH-TT process, but well above the TS for tautomerization to s-SH-TT (~17 kJ mol\u22121) and also clearly above the TS for production of the observed a-SH-TT product (~53 kJ mol\u22121). The important fact here is that, contrarily to a-SH-TT, which is stable once it is produced, the s-SH-TT form cannot persist, tautomerizing promptly back to s-OH-TT by spontaneous QMT because of a low (~9 kJ mol\u22121) and thin (~0.63 \u00c5) barrier separating these two species. With such barrier, the occurrence of extremely fast QMT is expected, making s-SH-TT a fleeting species even at cryogenic conditions (estimated \u03c41/2 ~1 \u00d7 10\u221211 s applying the Wentzel\u2013Kramers\u2013Brillouin model [80]). These data unequivocally justify the experimental capture and identification of the thiol a-SH-TT form and not of s-SH-TT form upon vibrational excitation of s-OH-TT. The observed tautomerization of a-SH-TT back to s-OH-TT was also successfully induced upon irradiation at the wavenumber of the CH stretching 1st overtone (5947 cm\u20131) or the combination mode at 5990 cm\u20131 of this isomer (see Figure 14). In this case, the energy deposited in the molecule (~71 kJ mol\u22121) is high enough to activate the SH-rotamerization to s-SH-TT (~33 kJ mol\u22121), which rapidly tautomerizes by tunneling to s-OH-TT. Globally, these results demonstrate that the hydroxyl \u2192 thiol and thiol \u2192 hydroxyl tautomerizations in thiotropolone, which imply cleavage of an OH or SH bond and formation of and SH or OH bond, respectively, were both promoted by vibrational excitation of the corresponding reactant tautomeric species, generalizing the use of IR-induced chemistry also to covalent bond-breaking/bond-forming processes. More recently, we have shown that IR-induced bond-breaking/bond-forming reactions can also be successfully promoted for neat solid samples at low temperature [81].\nAnother advance in the field of IR-induced chemistry was our recent demonstration that bond-breaking/bond-forming reactions can likewise be induced by vibrational excitation of an antenna remotely located in relation to the molecular reaction site [82]. This generalization of the use of remote vibrational antennas to promote chemical reactions involving cleavage and formation of covalent bonds opened the gate for a wider application of IR-induced chemistry, in particular in organic chemistry. The selected reactant molecule was a fluoro-substituted benzazirine bearing an OH vibrational antenna (2,6-difluoro-4hydroxy-2H-benzazirine; Figure 16). This species was produced in situ in a low temperature (15 K) krypton matrix by UV (455 nm) irradiation of the corresponding nitrene, which was also generated in situ by photolysis (255 nm) of the azide precursor (Figure 16).\nFigure 16. In situ generation of the 2,6-difluoro-4-hydroxy-2Hbenzazirine from the corresponding azide precursor isolated in a krypton matrix (15 K). Two successive irradiations were performed, at different wavelengths, the first giving rise to the nitrene species and the second converting this latter into the desired benzazirine. Adapted from ref. 82. Copyright 2021 Royal Society of Chemistry.\nAs shown in Figure 17, IR irradiation of the benzazirine through the remotely located OH vibrational antenna (via its OH 1st overtone at 7054 cm\u20131) led to its transformation into the cyclic ketenimine 3,7-difluoro-5-hydroxy-1-aza-1,2,4,6-cycloheptatetraene, with breaking of a C\u2013C bond and extensive rearrangement of the electronic -bonding system. It is worth noticing that both the benzazirine and the photoproduced ketenimine were found to be present in the matrix in a single conformer, the syn and anti forms, respectively, while two conformers of each molecule exist (no IR bands ascribable to the alternative conformers of these molecules were observed experimentally [82]). The explanation for this can be rationalized based on Figure 18 and involves again reactions taking place through the QMT mechanism.\nPage 11 of 50 Ch mical Society Reviews"

These low energy barriers allow for fast OHrotamerization QMT to take place, precluding observation of the higher-energy forms of the two molecules. In consonance with this interpretation, tunneling calculations using the Wentzel\u2013Kramers\u2013Brillouin model [82] estimated very short half-lives for both the anti-benzazirine [t1/2 ~10\u20137 s] and synketenimine [t1/2 ~10\u20134 s]. In this regard, it is then likely that the IR vibrational excitation of the syn-benzazirine induces ringexpansion to the syn-ketenimine, which then undergoes fast QMT OH-rotamerization to the observed anti-ketenimine form.

Copyright 2021 Royal Society of Chemistry.\nIn summary, in our study [82], we demonstrated that the selective IR vibrational excitation of a remote antenna allows inducing a bond-breaking/bond-forming reaction in an organic molecule, in an efficient way. This accomplishment paves the way for developing a general approach to guide a variety of molecular structure manipulations using IR-light and creates unprecedented opportunities for highly-selective transformations, in ways not attainable by thermal or electronic excitation processes.\nSwitching on H\u2011tunneling through IR-induced conformational control In one of our most recent investigations [83], we demonstrated the feasibility of using IR-induced chemistry as a switch to control H-atom tunneling. This was outlined with a triplet 2-hydroxyphenylnitrene generated in an N2 matrix at 10 K by UV-irradiation of an azide precursor. The anti conformer of the nitrene, where the OH moiety points to the opposite side of the nitrogen atom, could be selectively converted into the syn conformer upon vibrational excitation at the wavenumber of its \u03bdOH stretching 1st overtone (6976 cm\u20131). By this way, the hydroxyl hydrogen atom moves closer to the vicinal nitrene center, triggering spontaneous H-tunneling to a singlet 6-imino2,4-cyclohexadienone (Figure 19). The reaction was monitored by IR spectroscopy using a long-pass filter blocking IR light above 1580 cm\u22121 to exclude the absorption of photons above the OH-rotamerization barrier of the nitrene (\u223c1700 cm\u22121 as calculated at the B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p) level [83]) (Figure 20). Computations reveal that such fast H-tunneling occurs through crossing the triplet-to-singlet potential energy surfaces [83], establishing in this way a rare model for a nonadiabatic H-atom QMT. Note that the alternative conceivable mechanism for the reaction of the syn triplet nitrene that considers the occurrence of H-atom QMT on the triplet surface to the triplet 6-imino-2,4cyclohexadienone, followed by intersystem crossing, could be safely excluded [83]. Indeed, the height (\u223c98.2 kJ mol\u22121) of the barrier for the reaction in the triplet surface is incompatible with the occurrence of a very fast QMT reaction and with the elusive nature of the syn triplet nitrene (according to Wentzel\u2212 Kramers\u2212Brillouin calculations, its half-life time would be 1.14 \u00d7 103 s, if tunneling occurred in the triplet surface [83]).\n-2.0\n0.0\n2.0\n0\n100\n200\n1950 1750 1550 1350 1150 950 750 0\n100\n200\n\n\n\n  \n \n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n \n\n \n\n\n\n\n~\nI nt\n. / k\nm m\nol 1\nIn t.\n/ k m\nm ol\n1\nWavenumber / cm1\nirr. 7054 cm1 (b)\n A\nbs or\nba nc\ne\n102\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n \nComputed (c)\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\nComputed (a)N\nO\nF F\nH3s\nN\nO\nF F\nH 4a\nPage 12 of 50Ch mical Society Reviews"

            "text": "As emphasized in the Introduction section of this article, examples of QMT-driven reactions involving the motion of light hydrogen atoms are relatively abundant and this phenomenon has been recognized to play an important role in organic chemistry, biochemistry, and catalysis [86-90]. Because the tunneling probabilities decrease exponentially with the square root of the moving mass, atoms heavier than hydrogen were for long assumed to behave essentially classically [90]. However, recent evidence indicates that heavy-atom QMT can have significant implications for many chemical reactions [91,92]. About a dozen of examples of direct spectroscopic observation of carbon-atom QMT occurring under matrix isolation conditions have been reported [92-96]. In recent investigations, we have also discovered a new and distinctive case of a heavy-\natom QMT reaction involving the displacement of both nitrogen and oxygen atoms [97]. The 2-formyl-3-fuorophenylazide precursor, which was designed to achieve stabilization of the syn-aldehyde conformation, allows generation of the corresponding triplet syn-2-formylarylnitrene upon UV-irradiation under cryogenic conditions. Once produced, this nitrene species was observed to spontaneously cyclize to the corresponding singlet 2,1-benzisoxazole (Figure 21). The experimental IR spectrum of the consumed and produced species is well reproduced by the B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p) computed IR spectra, providing unequivocal identification for the occurrence of such cyclization\nreaction (Figure 22). The reaction kinetics was measured in the dark in an argon matrix at 10, 15 and 20 K, and rate constants of 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 s\u22121 were obtained. The observation of a fast and temperature-independent cyclization rate at those low temperatures provided convincing evidence for the occurrence of a heavy-atom QMT cyclization [97].\nFigure 21.

Rev, 2022, 00, 1-3 | 13\nPlease do not adjust margins\nPlease do not adjust margins\nis energetically higher than the triplet state of the reactant. A minimum energy crossing point (MECP) between the triplet nitrene and singlet benzisoxazole surfaces was found at 50 kJ mol\u22121. Such large reaction energy requirement is clearly prohibitive to be achieved by a classical process at the cryogenic temperatures of the experiment. On the other hand, a spinforbidden heavy-atom QMT rate calculated by nonadiabatic transition state theory (NA-TST) using the weak coupling (WC) model, at the MRMP(10,10)//CASSCF(10,10) or M06-2X levels of theory, provides a qualitative agreement with the experimental values, supporting the exclusive existence of a mechanism of heavy atom tunneling through crossing triplet and singlet potential energy surfaces [97]. To the best of our knowledge, the WC formulation of nonadiabatic-TST was for the first time successfully applied in this study to calculate vibrational ground state QMT reactions rates. We also recently unveiled a new reactivity paradigm in this area by demonstrating that a well-defined chemical starting material spontaneously decay at cryogenic temperatures into two different products via two competitive heavy-atom QMT processes [98]. After generation of 4-amino-2H-benzazirine in an argon matrix (3\u221218 K), this species was observed to concomitantly undergo spontaneous ring-opening to a triplet nitrene and ring-expansion to a cyclic ketenimine (Figure 23). The process was monitored by IR spectroscopy, which allows the identification of these two products by comparison with their IR spectra signature (obtained during UV-irradiation experiments starting from an azide precursor), and the identification of the consumed benzazirine with the support of its B3LYP/6 311+G(2d,p) computed IR spectrum (Figure 24). The reaction kinetic was measured at 3, 10 and 18 K, and rate constants of 5.5 \u00d7 10\u22125, 6.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 and 7.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 s\u22121, respectively, were obtained. The observed triplet nitrene : cyclic ketenimine product ratio was 15:85 (3 K), 18:82 (10 K) and 17:83 (18 K). The evidence that the reaction rate is nearly constant upon increasing of the temperature by a factor of five and that the product rate practically did not change confirmed that the observed benzazirine transformations were due to two independent and competitive heavy-atom tunneling reactions [98].\nThe ring-opening mechanism of 4-amino-2H-benzazirine should involve the formation of the corresponding open-shell singlet (OSS) nitrene, followed by fast ISC to triplet nitrene ground state. Due to the need of using multi-configurational methods to correctly described OSS nitrenes, such transformation was computed at NEVPT2(8,8)//CASSCF(8,8) level and an energy barrier of 10.5 kJ mol\u22121 was estimated. The ring-expansion mechanism of 4-amino-2H-benzazirine to the corresponding\ncyclic ketenimine was found to be most reliably computed at the CCSD(T)//B3LYP level, and an energy barrier of 30.5 kJ mol\u22121 was estimated (Figure 25). According to the classic TST, even such low energy barriers are prohibitive at the cryogenic temperatures of the experiment. Moreover, the formation of cyclic ketenimine as major product, having a higher energy barrier than the minor nitrene product, contradicts the rules inferred from classic TST. Therefore, it becomes clear that a thermal over-the-barrier process cannot explain the observed transformation but only the occurrence of heavy-atom QMT dominated by tunneling control. Indeed, computed tunneling probabilities through those two barriers (applying the WentzelKramers-Brillouin formalism), predict the existence of two competitive reactions of the benzazirine, in line with the experimental observations. Computations also show that for the tunneling of the benzazirine to the nitrene the nitrogen atom in the three-membered ring is clearly the heavy-atom with the largest displacement, whereas for the tunneling of the benzazirine to the ketenimine the two carbon atoms in the three-membered ring have by far the largest displacement [98]. Therefore, they support a case for the existence of competitive nitrogen vs. carbon QMT reactions occurring simultaneously with 4-amino-2H-benzazirine as the reactant species.\n0.23\n0.20\n0.56\n\u2022 \u2022 N\n\u2022 \u2022\nN\n88.7\n17.6\n3A2\nNEVPT2(8,8)//CASSCF(8,8) CCSD(T)//B3LYPNH2\nNH2\nTS2 30.5\n18.8\n0 10.5\nISC\n1A2 \u2022\n\u2022\nNH2\nN\n H /k\nJ m\nol  1\nC-TunnelingN-Tunneling\nTS1\nPage 14 of 50Ch mical Society Reviews"

            "heading": "Conclusion and Outlook",
            "text": "Along the previous sections, we have surveyed the major progresses in the field of IR-induced and tunneling-driven chemistry for matrix isolated species. As mentioned in the Introduction section, we focused essentially on our own contributions to develop vibrationally induced chemistry as a powerful tool to manipulate molecular structures in a highly selective way, and to use and control QMT as a tool to explore the reactivity of organic molecules in an unprecedented way. Figure 26 provides a timeline graph that summarizes these major achievements in a historical perspective. We have showed that using tunable narrowband IR-light and matrix isolation conditions, it is possible to manipulate the structure and reactivity of chosen molecular species in a very selective way. This methodology has been applied successfully to trigger conformational isomerizations in a different range of organic compounds, including weakly-bonded (dimeric) species. Noteworthy, the feasibility to produce high-energy conformers of different species by vibrational excitation, which otherwise are not accessible to experimentation, opened the gate to new fascinating investigations such as conformational selective chemistry or the synthesis of unusual high-energy crystals composed by rare conformers. From the first cases studied, where the IR-induced conformational isomerizations comprised changes in the moiety where the vibrational excitation was applied or in an adjacent bond, we and others expanded the scope of the technique to consider also reversible interconversions between conformers by vibrational excitation of a group (having the role of an antenna) remotely located from the fragment undergoing conformational changes. Moreover, we have demonstrated that different antennas can be used in an interchangeable way to trigger conformational isomerizations of the same remote molecular fragment. Our recent demonstration that vibrational excitation can be used to induce bond-breaking/bond-forming reactions for matrix-isolated organic molecules established a new domain in vibrationally-driven chemistry. Furthermore, envisioning a generalized strategy to guide a variety of chemical reactions using IR light, we demonstrated as proof-of-principle the triggering of an electrocyclic reaction by vibrational excitation of an antenna remotely located in relation to the reaction center. We expect that future studies using target molecules with more than one vibrational antenna and more than one possible reaction coordinates will give fundamental answers regarding the relation between the nature of the excited mode and the activated reactions. By introducing vibrational energy\nin a molecule in an amount above the threshold required to induce different transformations, the possibility to activate a higher-energy pathway, so that it can effectively compete with a lower-energy one, is a problem currently under study in our laboratories. Such investigations can be expected to strongly expand the power of IR-induced processes for more practically oriented uses and provide important hints regarding intramolecular vibrational energy redistribution in different types of molecular systems. Up until quite recently, all IR-induced processes carried out for matrix isolated species resorted on the vibrational excitation of fundamental vibrations or first overtones (or combination modes) of favorable stretching modes, such as that of an OH group. A significant progress was achieved when we demonstrated that selective vibrational excitation of second overtone modes, 3\u03bd(OH), also successfully triggers conformational isomerizations in the target molecules. Such approach allows to introduce much more energy in a molecule [120 kJ mol\u20131 for 3\u03bd(OH) vs. 80 kJ mol\u20131 for 2\u03bd(OH)] and, therefore, offer prospects to control the manipulation of chemical species stable even at temperatures close to room temperature. In conjugation with our recent breakthrough on inducing bond-breaking/bond-forming reactions by infrared vibrational excitation and the demonstration of the feasibility of such approach also to neat solid conditions, we might foresee the development of this methodology to achieve the activation of drugs in vivo or the switch of materials in optical and electronic devices in a highly controlled and selective way, not attainable by thermal and electronic excitation. We have also shown here that IR-induced processes in cryogenic matrices are frequently entangled with tunnelingdriven reactions. Several investigations on direct spectroscopic observation of spontaneous conformational isomerizations of high-energy conformers (produced by vibrational excitation of lower energy forms) at cryogenic temperatures have provided important data to improve our knowledge of fundamental principles of the QMT phenomenon. Interestingly, some studies have unrevealed the occurrence of vibrationally-assisted QMT processes, by showing that conformational isomerizations can take place even when the vibration excitation energy introduced in the target conformer is below that corresponding to the isomerization energy barrier. As described in details above, more recently, we have demonstrated how to switch on H-atom QMT by IR-induced conformation control. To the best of our knowledge, such approach represented the first ever achievement of the control of tunneling by means of external radiation. We can expect future advances in such new conceptual strategy to harness the control of QMT, which will be likely to inspire progress in the fields of enzymatic catalysis and quantum switches, and to provide new avenues for directing chemical transformations. Contributing to a paradigm shift, we and others have been reported direct spectroscopic observation of heavy-atom QMT reactions in cryogenic matrices, in this way demonstrating that this phenomenon can have much more significant implications in chemical reactivity than previously thought. Although most examples comprise carbon-atom QMT, we have also discovered\nPage 15 of 50 Ch mical Society Reviews"

One can expect that future studies will extend the limits of observed QMT to even heavier elements, such as fluorine. Besides, we have also unraveled a new, fascinating reactivity pattern, by demonstrating a unique case of two competitive heavy-atom QMT reactions (nitrogen vs. carbon) occurring simultaneously from a well-defined chemical starting material, leading to two\ndifferent products. This paradigmatic example offers an excellent opportunity to investigate how electronic effects imposed internally by different substituents or externally by different media can tune the selectivity of a QMT reaction. Electronic effects will most likely affect QMT differently than an over-the-barrier process, rationalized by classical TST, and, therefore, new fundamental understanding will likely emerge from such studies. Due to the recent progress witness on the field of QMT reactions, we foresee their entrance in synthetic organic chemistry and synthetic planning disciplines for the very near future. In this way, new reactivity paradigms and synthetic strategies will likely emerge under more conventional laboratory conditions, opening new avenues for the design of new molecules.\nThis is the story of a still ongoing endeavor, and by this reason necessarily an incomplete (but opportune) story. We can only expect that this survey can stimulate others to contribute to the development of the field and inspire young scientists to follow our steps in this captivating adventure. But, as pointed out in the beginning of this article, this story is also incomplete in the sense that many others have also been given very important contributions to the development of the research areas here addressed. To all of them we have to pay our respect and\nacknowledge for their invaluable efforts. Author Contributions All authors contributed equally to the article."

            "text": "The first reported IR-induced reaction was described by Hall and\nPimentel almost 60 years ago [1]. In that pioneer experiment,\nthe authors isolated nitrous acid in an argon matrix and used\nbroadband infrared excitation in the OH stretching wavenumber region (3650-3200 cm\u20131) to induce changes in the\nrelative populations of the two conformers of the molecule\n(Figure 1). The conformational changes were found to depend\non the specific wavenumber range applied to irradiate the\nsample, which could be chosen by using appropriate infrared\nbandpass filters. In their article, Hall and Pimentel pointed out\nthat \u201cthe [observed] IR-induced isomerization of nitrous acid can\nbe considered to be a new type of photochemical reaction\u201d and\nstressed the fact that the \u201cstudy of this reaction [was] possible\nonly because of the unique potentialities of the matrix isolation\ntechnique\u201d [1]. They appropriately concluded that \u201cperhaps the\nmost important [result] in this work is the implied high efficiency\nof intramolecular energy transfer among the vibrational\ndegrees of freedom of a vibrationally excited molecule\u201d [1].\nVery interestingly, at the time, the discovery of Hall and\nPimentel was not received so enthusiastically by the scientific\ncommunity as it could be expected considering its highly\ninnovative character. The main reason for that was the lack of\nselectivity of the observed process. In fact, upon broadband\nexcitation both conformers were being simultaneously excited,\nso that their final populations resulted from the attainment of a\nphotostationary state. A photostationary state is a function of\nthe applied excitation wavenumber range and, in that way,\nsome control of the system can be achieved. Nevertheless, it\nwas clear that to accomplish full control of this type of reactions\nand make the approach useful for application to other systems,\nselective excitation of a single specific conformer had to be\nmade possible.\nThis problem was only solved 34 years later, when infrared\nnarrowband tunable light sources became more easily\navailable. In 1997, Pettersson, Lundell, Khriahtchev and\nR\u00e4s\u00e4nen, at the University of Helsinki, published a major\nbreakthrough study [2] where the selective conformational\nisomerization of formic acid isolated in an argon matrix was\nsuccessfully induced by narrowband excitation with a laser-\nbased IR tunable light source.

In those studies, isotopically labelled\nformic acid and different types of matrices were used.\nOur group had the chance to join those pioneer investigations\nsince the very beginning. The studies were promptly expanded\nto other simple carboxylic and dicarboxylic acids, like acetic,\noxalic, fumaric, maleic and malonic acids [7,11-15]. From our\nfruitful collaboration with the Helsinki group (and also in result\nof the work of other groups participating in this adventure)\nsome general conclusions emerged, which became the basis for\nthe subsequent more elaborated studies on more complex\nsystems, like amino acids, nucleic acid bases, halogenated\ncarboxylic acids, -hydroxyl, -keto and ,-unsaturated\ncarboxylic acids, aromatic and other cyclic carboxylic acids, and\nphenol derivatives [16-47], among others.\nOne very interesting early observation was that the IR excitation\nof a matrix isolated compound can be selective to the nature of\nthe matrix sites occupied by the molecules [5]. In a matrix,\nmolecules might be trapped in different local environments\n(matrix sites). Molecules in different matrix sites feel different\nintermolecular potentials due to the different interactions with\nthe matrix atoms, this leading to slightly different\nintramolecular potentials. Therefore, the vibrational spectra of\nidentical molecules trapped in different sites differ slightly. In\npractice, this leads to observation of bands in the spectrum of a\ngiven compound that appear split. It shall be noticed that not all\nbands have to show matrix splitting, since this depends upon\nthe degree of perturbation of the intramolecular potential\nassociated to each vibrational coordinate in result of the\nintermolecular interactions. In general, vibrational coordinates\nassociated with more polar groups are more affected by the\nmatrix medium and the corresponding bands appear more\nfrequently split due matrix effects. For simple carboxylic acids,\nthis is the case of, for example, the OH and C=O stretching\nmodes. For formic acid, it was found that the molecules may\noccupy two main sites in an argon matrix, which give rise toOH fundamental bands at 3548.2 (site 1) and 3550.5 cm\u20131 (site 2) [5]. The corresponding 1st overtone bands are observed at 6930.3 and 6934.8 cm\u20131 [5]. As shown in Figure 2, excitation of\nmolecules trapped in a given matrix site at the wavenumber of the corresponding OH 1st overtone results in the Z \u2192 E\nconformational conversion, without affecting in a measurable\nway the structure of the site. This means that, besides being\nselective to the molecular species (e.g., a given conformer of a\ngiven molecule), the reactions resulting from vibrational\nexcitation are also selective regarding the local matrix trapping\nenvironment. As it will be shown later in this article, such\nselectivity is also kept when the energy delivered to the\nreactant conformer is substantially higher than that corresponding to excitation to a OH stretching 1st overtone,\ni.e., when excitation is performed, for example, at the\ncharacteristic wavenumbers of higher-order overtones of this\nvibration.\nAnother fascinating observation resulting from the very first\nseries of studies with narrowband selective vibrational\nexcitation was that the mechanism of energy redistribution\nfrom the excited coordinate to the reactive coordinate (in the\ncase of the conformational isomerization of formic acid this\nlatter is the low energy C\u2013O torsional coordinate) is not strictly\nstatistical, implying that there are preferred channels which\nmaximize the efficiency of the process. One simple proof for this\nis the observation of very similar efficiencies in the IR-induced\nisomerization processes of molecules having significantly\ndifferent numbers of potentially competitive acceptor low-\nenergy coordinates, e.g. formic acid and cytosine [2,6,45]. The\nexistence of such funnel-like preferential energy relaxation\nchannels was demonstrated for the case of matrix isolated\nformic acid using time-resolved IR spectroscopy [48].\nIn the context of the present article, however, the most relevant\nobservation extracted from the initial studies on IR-induced\nprocesses in cryogenic matrices was the fact that the\nconformational isomerization reactions may take place even\nwhen the energy deposited in the excited coordinate stays\nbelow that of the barrier separating the reactant conformer\nfrom the product. This was first observed for formic acid [6], and\nimmediately after for acetic acid [49], but it is a rather general\nphenomenon. As shown in Figure 3, the quantum yields for the\nZ \u2192 E conformational conversion in both formic and acetic acids\nreduce by only one to two orders of magnitude once the\nexcitation energy stays below but close to that corresponding\nto the energy barrier of the reaction, and only diminish\nconsiderably when the excitation is performed at an energy far\nfrom that of the energy barrier. The significant quantum yields\nof the reaction for excitation at energies below the barrier are\neasily explained taking into account its occurrence via the\nquantum mechanical tunneling (QMT) mechanism.

Such\nsecondary relaxation channel has as final acceptor coordinate\nthe low-energy internal rotation of the methyl group of acetic\nacid [49].\nAn additional observation resulting from the studies performed\non the simple carboxylic acids first investigated was that the\nhigher energy E conformers (formed upon vibrational excitation\nof the most stable Z conformers) spontaneously decay back to\nthe original species in the dark via a tunneling-driven process.\nFor formic acid isolated in argon, such tunneling process has a rate of ca. 2 x 10\u20133 s\u20131, which corresponds to a half-live of the E\nform of a few minutes [5]. The nature of the mechanism\ninvolved in these reactions was since the very beginning proved\nunequivocally through experiments with isotopically labelled\nformic and acetic acids [5,6,49], and this has been confirmed\nlater for other types of molecules containing the carboxylic\ngroup (e.g., amino acids and halogenated carboxylic acids [16-\n19,35-41]). The relevance of spontaneous QMT decay of higher-\nenergy conformers produced in situ in matrices (using either\nvibrational or electronic excitation of suitable precursors) has\nalso been demonstrated for other types of conformational\nisomerizations involving movement of hydrogen atoms, for\nexample in derivatives of nucleic acid bases and phenols [30,42-\n47].\nAs noticed above, the matrix isolation method provides optimal\nconditions for direct observation of QMT. The very low work\ntemperatures characteristic of a matrix isolation experiment\n(typically of a few Kelvin) prevent occurrence of any\nspontaneous over-the-barrier reaction that has an associated barrier higher than a few kJ mol\u20131. Under these conditions,\nobservation of a spontaneous reaction usually implies that it\ntakes place by tunneling. Since tunneling from the ground\nvibrational state implies that the reaction product has a lower\nenergy than the reactant, it is easy to understand why\nvibrational excitation is particularly suitable to allow for\nobservation of tunneling reactions: in one side, one can shift the\nstate of the reactant to a higher vibrational state and open the\ngate for tunneling to products otherwise inaccessible and, on\nthe other side, a higher energy species can be first generated as\na result of the vibrational excitation of the reactant followed by\nenergy relaxation, and subsequently undergo a tunneling-\ndriven reaction to the final product. In the latter case, the final\nproduct can either be the original reactant, as in the cases\ndescribed above for formic and acetic acids, or a completely\ndifferent species, as it will be here shown later. In this way, in a\ncertain perspective one can state that IR-induced chemistry and\nQMT are, under matrix isolation conditions, very often\nentangled processes. The interesting point is that one can take\nadvantage of this intertwining to strategically play with the\nstructure of molecules, as it will be demonstrated in the next\nsections.\nIt shall also be highlighted at this point that recent studies of\nQMT in cryogenic matrices have been providing evidence that\nthis phenomenon shall not be considered only as a\ncomplementary mechanism to kinetics and thermodynamics in\nexplaining chemical reactivity. QMT can in fact even determine\nthe reactivity of a chemical species, superseding the classical\nrules of thermodynamics and kinetics and emerging as a new\nparadigm in chemical reactivity [50,51]. Figure 4 exemplifies\nhow this can be conceived. In the top panel of the figure, a\npotential energy profile for two competitive reactions of A, to\ngive products B and C, is presented. B corresponds to the\nthermodynamically driven product of lowest energy, while C is\nthe result of kinetical control, generated via a lower energy\ntransition state. Tunneling can also be considered to take place\nfor generation of both B and C, and in matrix isolation\nconditions even dominate or occur exclusively (depending on\nthe barrier heights and widths), but whatever the situation\nwould be in this case tunneling does not lead to a new product.\nOn the other hand, the potential energy profile shown in the\nbottom panel of Figure 4 is considerably more interesting, and\nit is exemplified for a real example [50,52]. In this case, the 1,2-\nmethyl shift product of rearrangement of tert-butylchloro-\ncarbene is both the thermodynamics and kinetics determined\nproduct, since it has the lowest energy among the possible\nproducts and can be reached via the lowest energy transition\nstate. However, after in situ generation of the reactant carbene\nin a cryogenic N2 matrix (at 11 K), this putative product was not experimentally observed [52]. Instead, the C\u2013H bond insertion\nPage 23 of 50 Ch mical Society Reviews"

Another paradigmatic example of\ntunneling control of chemical reactivity has been reported\nrecently by Shreiner, involving the rearrangement of matrix\nisolated methylhydoxycarbene [50,51].\nBefore starting to provide relevant examples to illustrate the\nprogress on the investigation of IR-induced and tunneling-\ndriven reactions observed in cryogenic matrices in a historical\nperspective, which will be the subject of the next sections of this\narticle, it appears appropriate to present here the main reasons\nwhy vibrationally-induced chemistry is so appealing. The main\nreason for this is because a laser can be tuned to the vibrational\nfrequency of a specific bond and used to deposit sufficient\nenergy to cleave that bond while leaving the remaining part of\nthe molecule practically undisturbed. This is a very much\ndifferent situation compared to thermally- or UV-induced\nprocesses, where extensive changes are made to the structure\nof the whole molecule. Using a simple comparison, IR-induced\nprocesses are the equivalent of a laparoscopic surgery, where\nthe target organ is reached with minimum damage of the body,\nin opposition to a strongly invasive open-abdominal surgery,\nwhich in this comparison is the equivalent of both thermal and\nUV-induced reactions. Additionally, IR excitation may be used to\nchange the structure of the molecule, in a very specific and\nlocalized way, to open new reaction channels, as illustrated, for\nexample, in the decomposition reaction of diazomethane\ndepicted in Figure 5. In this case, selective vibrational excitation\nof the CNN anti-symmetric stretching fundamental of the\nmolecule was performed [53], which took the molecule to a\nvibrational state where the path to the cleavage of the CN bond\nvia CH2 bending became accessible.\nAnother interesting possibility opened by IR-induced chemistry\nresults from the fact that conformers can be produced in a very\nselective way, including conformers of high-energy otherwise\nnot accessible to experimentation. This allows for\nconformationally selective chemistry to be investigated. The\nUV-induced photodegradation of formic acid is a good example\nof conformationally dependent reactivity of a compound [4],\nbut other examples have also been reported [54-57]. Formic\nacid has only two conformers and they were found to have\ndistinct preferential photodegradation pathways (Figure 6).\nAfter isolation in a cryogenic matrix of the most stable Z\nconformer, UV irradiation results mostly in the production of CO\n+ H2O. On the other hand, in situ generation of the higher energy E conformer, upon vibrational excitation of the initially\ndeposited Z form, allowed for the investigation of its\nphotochemistry, which was shown to preferentially yield H2 + CO2 [4]. In the next sections, the major developments resulting from the\nabove-mentioned initial experiments on IR-induced chemistry\nand interconnected tunneling-driven reactions will be\npresented, following closely our involvement in the field for\nmore than 30 years. We will focus mostly on our own work, but\nmany other groups have also been given outstanding\nPage 24 of 50Ch mical Society Reviews"

The story here presented is necessarily an incomplete\nstory. Nevertheless, it considers a large range of examples, from\nvery selective IR-induced conformational isomerizations to\nsuccessful observations of rare heavy atom tunneling\nprocesses, and it provides a rather general overview of most of\nthe major progresses achieved in the field.\nFrom simple 2-states systems to complex multistates systems: on the route of generalization\nThe first IR-induced studies focused on simple molecules\nexhibiting two conformational states, with particular emphasis\non formic and acetic acids [2-6,49]. Our already classic study on\npropionic acid (in collaboration with the Helsinki group) [66]\nappeared as a landmark in the field, bringing the technique to\nthe investigation of a molecule with a larger number of relevant\nconformers.\nPropionic acid has two conformers of low energy, where the carboxylic group is in the Z conformation (Z-syn and Z-skew\u00b1),\nand two conformers of higher energy, where the carboxylic group is in the E conformation (E-syn and E-skew\u00b1). Figure 7\nshows the structures of the conformers and the energy barriers\nfor their interconversion, as predicted theoretically.\nConsidering their high relative energy, the E conformers have a\nnegligible population in gas phase, so that it could be expected\nthat only the two Z conformers should be observed\nexperimentally. Interestingly, it was found that the most stable\nZ-syn conformer was exclusively present in the as-deposited matrices of the compound [66]. The absence of the Z-skew\u00b1\nconformer in the initially prepared matrices is, however, easy to\nunderstand. This conformer is separated from the most stable form by a very small energy barrier (0.72 kJ mol\u20131, as predicted\nat the MP2/6-311++G(2d,2p) level [66]). This barrier is then\neasily surpassed at the time the molecules, initially in a hot\ngaseous beam, land onto the optical substrate (a CsI window\ncooled to 15 K) during deposition of the matrix. Consequently, the higher-energy Z-skew\u00b1 conformer converts into the most\nstable Z-syn form. This phenomenon (known by conformational\ncooling effect) is well-known and has been observed many\ntimes in matrix isolation experiments for molecules with conformers separated by energy barriers of only a few kJ mol\u20131\n[67-69].\nThe fact that just the Z-syn conformer is present in the as-\ndeposited matrices of propionic acid is interesting, since this\nallows for the study of its properties and reactivity in an easy\nway. The vibrational excitation of this conformer at the wavenumber of its OH stretching 1st overtone (6960 cm\u20131) was\nfound to generate both the high-energy E-syn conformer, via rotation around the C\u2013O bond, and the Z-skew\u00b1 conformer,\nthrough rotation about the C\u2013C bond. The latter conformer, once produced in situ, is rather stable under matrix isolation\nconditions at the lowest temperatures used (8 K), because now no energy is available to efficiently surpass the Z-skew\u00b1 \u2192 Z-syn\nbarrier. On the other hand, the E-syn conformer decays quickly\nback to the Z-syn conformer by tunneling, since this reaction\ninvolves only motion of the light carboxylic hydrogen atom (this\nis in fact a similar process to those observed in formic and acetic acids described above). Hence, not just the E-syn and Z-skew\u00b1\nconformers could be prompted identified and characterized\nvibrationally [66], but these experiments opened the possibility\nfor the study of their specific reactivities. Since the initially produced Z-skew\u00b1 conformer is stable under the experimental\nconditions used, a subsequent IR-irradiation at the wavenumber of its OH stretching 1st overtone (6950 cm\u20131)\ncould be undertaken. In result of such irradiation, this conformer was converted into the highest-energy E-skew\u00b1\nconformer, thus generating the last of the 4 conformers of\npropionic acid (this conformer also decays in the dark, by QMT,\nto the most stable conformer) [66].\nThe whole series of experiments performed on propionic acid is\nsummarized in Figure 8 and illustrates well the power of the\ncoordinated use of IR-induced chemistry and tunneling to\nmanipulate chemical structures. The next example deals with an\neven more complex chemical system and shows how IR-\nexcitation can be coupled not just with QMT but also with UV-\nexcitation in a strategic way to achieve selective structural\nmanipulations.

These species are\nrepresented in Figure 9, which also summarizes the sequence of\nexperiments we successfully undertook to change the relative\namounts of the five forms in a cryogenic matrix [45-47].\nUpon deposition of cytosine in an argon matrix, the signatures\nof all the five isomers of cytosine depicted in Figure 9 were\ndetected [45-47]. UV irradiation at 300 nm resulted in\nconversion of the AO form into the remaining species. In this\nway, the population of the minor imino-oxo isomers could be\nstrongly enhanced. Subsequent irradiation at 311 nm led to\ninterconversion between the IO1 and IO2 isomers. This is a\ntypical reaction progressing toward a photostationary state\nand, when performed immediately after the irradiation at 300\nnm that converts AO into both IO1 and IO2, results in effective\nconversion of IO1 into the higher energy IO2 isomer. This UV\nirradiation does not change the populations neither of AO nor\nof the AH1 and AH2 isomers. On the other hand, when the\nmatrix is let in the dark, the AH2 form spontaneously decays by\nQMT to the most stable AH1 form, in a reaction obeying to a\ndispersive-type kinetics [47] with an average time constant of\nca. 36.5 h.\nSelective interconversions between the two amino-hydroxy\nconformers could be achieved by IR excitation. Irradiation at 7013 cm\u22121 (OH 1st overtone of AH1) led to conversion of this form into AH2, whereas irradiation at 7034 cm\u22121 (OH 1st\novertone of AH2) induced the opposite transformation [45].\nIt is worth mentioning that these studies were the first ever\nreported where IR-induced conformational isomerizations were\nsuccessfully achieved for a large heterocyclic molecule under\nmatrix isolation conditions. In polyatomic molecules containing\nmore than 10 atoms, the higher density of vibrational states\ncould a priori be expected to strongly affect the pathways of\nvibrational energy redistribution, and hence the efficiency of\nthe IR-induced conformational isomerizations. Nevertheless,\nthe results proved that for cytosine the process occurs with an\nefficiency that is similar to those observed for small molecules\nlike formic and acetic acid, and this was a clear experimental\nevidence of the existence of preferred channels for vibrational\nenergy redistribution.\nAnother relevant development in the field was the use of\nselective IR excitations to generate rare high-energy dimers of\ncarboxylic acids, showing that the method could also be applied\nfor weakly bonded species. Formic and acetic acids are the\nparadigmatic examples of this type of studies. For both\nmolecules a large number of unusual dimers was generated in\ncryogenic matrices upon vibrational excitation of more common\ndimeric species, and subsequently characterized structurally\nand spectroscopically [70,71]. The most interesting dimers of\nthese two carboxylic acids that have been produced this way\nhave at least one of their molecular units in the intrinsically less\nstable carboxylic E conformation. Since both E formic and acetic\nacid monomers are unstable in a cryogenic matrix, the E units\nof the dimer have to be generated in situ. Two different\nstrategies have been applied: in the first, the E monomer of the\nacid is first produced by vibrational excitation of the Z form, and\nthen the matrix is annealed to a higher temperature, allowing\nfor molecular diffusion and formation of the dimers containing\nthe E units (very interestingly, the E conformers were found to\ndiffuse in the warmed matrices more efficiently than the Z\nforms, which facilitated the generation of E containing dimers\n[70,71]); in the second approach, the Z-Z dimers are first\nprepared from the Z monomer by warming the matrix and then\nthe dimers are subjected to IR irradiation to convert them into\ndimers containing an E structural unit [70,71]. Figure 10\nillustrates this last case, for acetic acid. In this example, note the\nPage 26 of 50Ch mical Society Reviews"

Upon irradiation at the specific wavenumber of the OH 1st overtone of the free\nOH group of the Z-Z dimer D2 Z-Z, this species was converted to\nthe D2 Z-E dimer, without any change taking place either for the\nZ monomer or for the Z-Z centrosymmetric dimer D1 Z-Z\npresent in the matrix.\nVibrational excitation via higher-order overtones: opening the gate to higher energy processes\nOne limitation to the generalization of vibrational excitation as\na tool for inducing chemical reactivity is the relatively small\nrange of energies accessible. If excitation is undertaken using a\nfundamental vibration, in the most favorable case of pumping\nof the OH stretching mode, the energy introduced in the molecule is in the range of only 30\u201345 kJ mol\u20131 (3000-3600 cm\u20131). First overtone excitation expands the range of energy to 75-87 kJ mol\u20131 (6300\u20137300 cm\u20131), and this is enough energy to\nallow inducing quite efficiently many types of conformational\nisomerization processes. We asked ourselves about the\npossibility of using higher-order overtones to introduce even\nmore energy in the molecules. If possible, excitation using the 2nd overtone of a OH stretching mode would allow to expand\nthe range of processes energetically accessible to those having barriers as large as ca. 130 kJ mol\u20131. Though conceptually the\nidea is simple, there were some important questions to verify:\n(i) in order to choose the wavenumber to use for the excitation, the position of the 2nd overtone has to be determined, so that\nthe corresponding band has to be experimentally observed; is\nthis possible using the conventional detectors for near-IR?; (ii)\nfor the processes to be efficient, the IR absorption cross section\nof the mode to excite has to be as large as possible; is that of the OH 2nd overtone large enough?; (iii) since the width of the 2nd overtone bands can be expected to be larger than those of the fundamental bands or 1st overtones, can selectivity still be\nkept in a way that this can be useful in practical terms?; (iv)\nconsidering the higher energy introduced in the molecule, can\nthe process still be selective also regarding the matrix site, or\nwill it affect the nature of the sites? We noticed that for reliable observation of 2nd overtone bands\nof matrix isolated species the detection system of the FTIR\nspectrometer used for studies involving excitation of fundamentals or 1st overtones had to be improved. A\nthermoelectrically cooled indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs)\ndetector was then installed in our equipment. With this detector, the bands due to OH stretching 2nd overtones are in\ngeneral detectable. We also found that by appropriate choice of\nthe excitation conditions (in particular the laser power), the\nabsorption cross section of these vibrations is enough to\nguarantee efficiency of the IR-induced processes. For excitation,\na continuous wave diode tunable near-IR laser system Toptica DLC TA PRO (spectral range: 10500\u201310100 cm\u20131; fwhm < 1 MHz,\nup to 3 W) was purchased and, in a typical experiment,\nirradiation shall be carried on during 20 min with at least 120\nmW of power.\nThree structurally related molecules, hydroxyacetone, glycolic\nacid and glycolamide, were chosen as targets of the first\nexperiments [72].

Figure 11 summarizes the\nresults obtained for glycolamide, where the conversion of the\nTt conformer into the Cc form is demonstrated. Interestingly,\nthe process was shown to be site selective, allowing us to\nconclude that despite the higher energies involved compared to excitation of fundamentals and 1st overtone modes no\nmeasurable disturbance of the matrix sites takes place also upon excitation of the OH 2nd overtone.\nWe also noticed that, as anticipated, the widths of the OH 2nd\novertone bands are in general larger than those of the bands ascribed to fundamental and 1st overtone modes (FWHM 6 cm\u22121 vs 3 cm\u22121 for acid OH group of most stable conformer of\nglycolic acid [72]). Nevertheless, they still allow for selective\nexcitation to be performed in many cases, since the spacing\nbetween the absorption wavenumbers of the different\nconformers also tend to increase for the higher order\novertones. Higher-order overtone (v = 6) excitation Raman\nstudies on matrix isolated formic acid have been reported by\nOlbert-Majkut, Ahokas, Lundell and Pettersson, in studies\nwhere the E conformer was produced upon vibrational\nexcitation of the Z conformer using visible light (532.0 nm, or 18797 cm\u22121, provided by a continuous laser highly-focused at\nthe sample and a power level up to 260 mW). The laser light\nwas used simultaneously for pumping and to collect the Raman\nspectra [73,74]. Interestingly, the authors suggested that much\nhigher overtone states can also be used, opening the gate for\nUV-region vibrational overtone induced reactions [73]. We had\nnot yet attempted to use excitations at overtones above the\nsecond in a systematic way in our laboratory. Indeed, we\nperformed only a very preliminary series of experiments using\nvisible light excitation of matrix isolated formic acid, with a ns\npulsed light pumping source (at 532 nm) and IR spectroscopy\nprobing to detect the formation of the E conformer, but these\nexperiments resulted unsuccessful. One of the reasons for that\nwas, much probably, the irradiation power at the sample\nprovided by our irradiation system, which is much less than the\n260 mW used in the Raman experiments of Olbert-Majkut and\ncoworkers [73,74]. The feasibility and appropriateness of\nexcitations to higher than the second overtone as a general\nstrategy is not yet proved, at least when IR spectroscopy is used\nas probing technique, and this is a field that shall be considered\nstill open to investigation.\nThe concept of vibrational antenna: remote control of molecular structures\nThe first reported IR-induced structural transformations were\nlimited to changes in the close proximity of the excited fragment\nof the molecule. Most of times, excitation of the OH stretching\nmode was used to modify the orientation of the hydroxyl\nhydrogen atom itself, as in the case of the Z \u2192 E conformational\nconversion of carboxylic acids. Less frequently, internal rotation\naround a C\u2013C bond vicinal to the excited hydroxyl group was\nobserved, as in the cases of propionic acid and glycolamine\ndescribed above [66,72], but also in other compounds like\nglycolic acid and hydroxyacetone, for example [25,72]. From the\ncomparison of the quantum yields for the Z \u2192 E conformational\nconversion in formic and acetic acids, it could also be indirectly\nconcluded that excitation of the OH stretching mode also\ninduced internal rotation of the methyl group around the C\u2013C\nbond in the latter compound [49], as described in the\nintroduction section.\nIn 2015, we reported the first example of an IR-induced\nconformational isomerization of a fragment in a molecule that\nwas remotely located from the excited group [75]. The target\ncompound of these studies was 6-methoxy indole, which has\ntwo conformers of similar energy. By excitation of the NH stretching 1st overtone of the conformers, we were able to\nselectively interconvert them (Figure 12) [75]. The processes\ninvolve a structural transformation of a methoxy group located\nfour bonds apart from the excited vibrational antenna and were\nfound to be very efficient. Since this pioneer investigation, the\nconcept of remote vibrational antenna has been explored in our\ngroup in several other systems, like the thiol forms of\nthioacetamide, kojic acid or E-glutaconic acid [76-78], for\nexample. We have also shown that different antennas can be\nused in an interchangeable way to induce conformational\nchanges in the same molecular fragment, as demonstrated in\nour studies on conformational changes of an aldehyde group\nconnected to a 2H-azirine ring via vibrational excitation of\nhydroxy or amino antennas [79].\nPage 28 of 50Ch mical Society Reviews"

The first example was reported\nin 2020 and considered the bidirectional thiol\u2194hydroxy\ntautomerization in thiotropolone [80].\nThiotropolone has two tautomers, the thiol and the hydroxy\nforms, each one having two conformers. As shown in Figure 13,\nthe syn-hydroxy (s-OH-TT) form is the most stable species, followed by the syn-thiol isomer (s-SH-TT; 7.5 kJ mol\u20131 higher in\nenergy than the most stable form), the anti-thiol form (a-SH-TT; 17.1 kJ mol\u20131), and the anti-hydroxy isomer (a-OH-TT; 51.6 kJ mol\u20131).

Such energy is below the transition state (TS) for OH-rotamerization (~76 kJ mol\u22121),\njustifying the non-observation of the s-OH-TT \u2192 a-OH-TT\nprocess, but well above the TS for tautomerization to s-SH-TT (~17 kJ mol\u22121) and also clearly above the TS for production of the observed a-SH-TT product (~53 kJ mol\u22121). The important fact\nhere is that, contrarily to a-SH-TT, which is stable once it is\nproduced, the s-SH-TT form cannot persist, tautomerizing\npromptly back to s-OH-TT by spontaneous QMT because of a low (~9 kJ mol\u22121) and thin (~0.63 \u00c5) barrier separating these two\nspecies. With such barrier, the occurrence of extremely fast\nQMT is expected, making s-SH-TT a fleeting species even at cryogenic conditions (estimated \u03c41/2 ~1 \u00d7 10\u221211 s applying the Wentzel\u2013Kramers\u2013Brillouin model [80]). These data unequi-\nvocally justify the experimental capture and identification of the\nthiol a-SH-TT form and not of s-SH-TT form upon vibrational\nexcitation of s-OH-TT.\nThe observed tautomerization of a-SH-TT back to s-OH-TT was\nalso successfully induced upon irradiation at the wavenumber of the CH stretching 1st overtone (5947 cm\u20131) or the combination mode at 5990 cm\u20131 of this isomer (see Figure 14). In this case, the energy deposited in the molecule (~71 kJ mol\u22121)\nis high enough to activate the SH-rotamerization to s-SH-TT (~33 kJ mol\u22121), which rapidly tautomerizes by tunneling to s-OH-TT.\nGlobally, these results demonstrate that the hydroxyl \u2192 thiol\nand thiol \u2192 hydroxyl tautomerizations in thiotropolone, which\nimply cleavage of an OH or SH bond and formation of and SH or\nOH bond, respectively, were both promoted by vibrational\nexcitation of the corresponding reactant tautomeric species,\ngeneralizing the use of IR-induced chemistry also to covalent\nbond-breaking/bond-forming processes. More recently, we\nhave shown that IR-induced bond-breaking/bond-forming\nreactions can also be successfully promoted for neat solid\nsamples at low temperature [81].\nAnother advance in the field of IR-induced chemistry was our\nrecent demonstration that bond-breaking/bond-forming\nreactions can likewise be induced by vibrational excitation of an\nantenna remotely located in relation to the molecular reaction\nsite [82]. This generalization of the use of remote vibrational\nantennas to promote chemical reactions involving cleavage and\nformation of covalent bonds opened the gate for a wider\napplication of IR-induced chemistry, in particular in organic\nchemistry.\nThe selected reactant molecule was a fluoro-substituted\nbenzazirine bearing an OH vibrational antenna (2,6-difluoro-4-\nhydroxy-2H-benzazirine; Figure 16). This species was produced\nin situ in a low temperature (15 K) krypton matrix by UV (455\nnm) irradiation of the corresponding nitrene, which was also\ngenerated in situ by photolysis (255 nm) of the azide precursor\n(Figure 16).\nAs shown in Figure 17, IR irradiation of the benzazirine through the remotely located OH vibrational antenna (via its OH 1st overtone at 7054 cm\u20131) led to its transformation into the cyclic\nketenimine 3,7-difluoro-5-hydroxy-1-aza-1,2,4,6-cycloheptate-\ntraene, with breaking of a C\u2013C bond and extensive\nrearrangement of the electronic -bonding system. It is worth\nnoticing that both the benzazirine and the photoproduced\nketenimine were found to be present in the matrix in a single\nconformer, the syn and anti forms, respectively, while two\nconformers of each molecule exist (no IR bands ascribable to\nthe alternative conformers of these molecules were observed\nexperimentally [82]). The explanation for this can be\nrationalized based on Figure 18 and involves again reactions\ntaking place through the QMT mechanism.\nThe OH-rotamerization barrier converting the non-observed\nanti conformer of the benzazirine to the observed most stable syn conformer is only 7.5 kJ mol\u20131, whereas the barrier of\nconversion of the non-observed less stable syn conformer of the\nketenimine to the observed most stable anti form is 14.6 kJ mol\u20131 [82]. These low energy barriers allow for fast OH-\nrotamerization QMT to take place, precluding observation of\nthe higher-energy forms of the two molecules. In consonance\nwith this interpretation, tunneling calculations using the\nWentzel\u2013Kramers\u2013Brillouin model [82] estimated very short half-lives for both the anti-benzazirine [t1/2 ~10\u20137 s] and synketenimine [t1/2 ~10\u20134 s]. In this regard, it is then likely that the IR vibrational excitation of the syn-benzazirine induces ring-\nPage 30 of 50Ch mical Society Reviews"

The anti conformer of the\nnitrene, where the OH moiety points to the opposite side of the\nnitrogen atom, could be selectively converted into the syn\nconformer upon vibrational excitation at the wavenumber of its \u03bdOH stretching 1st overtone (6976 cm\u20131). By this way, the\nhydroxyl hydrogen atom moves closer to the vicinal nitrene\ncenter, triggering spontaneous H-tunneling to a singlet 6-imino-\n2,4-cyclohexadienone (Figure 19). The reaction was monitored\nby IR spectroscopy using a long-pass filter blocking IR light above 1580 cm\u22121 to exclude the absorption of photons above the OH-rotamerization barrier of the nitrene (\u223c1700 cm\u22121 as\ncalculated at the B3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p) level [83]) (Figure 20).\nComputations reveal that such fast H-tunneling occurs through\ncrossing the triplet-to-singlet potential energy surfaces [83],\nestablishing in this way a rare model for a nonadiabatic H-atom\nQMT. Note that the alternative conceivable mechanism for the\nreaction of the syn triplet nitrene that considers the occurrence\nof H-atom QMT on the triplet surface to the triplet 6-imino-2,4-\ncyclohexadienone, followed by intersystem crossing, could be safely excluded [83]. Indeed, the height (\u223c98.2 kJ mol\u22121) of the\nbarrier for the reaction in the triplet surface is incompatible\nwith the occurrence of a very fast QMT reaction and with the\nelusive nature of the syn triplet nitrene (according to Wentzel\u2212\nKramers\u2212Brillouin calculations, its half-life time would be 1.14 \u00d7 103 s, if tunneling occurred in the triplet surface [83]).\nThis study provides an exciting novel strategy to attain control\nover tunneling, opening new avenues for directing chemical\ntransformations. These results are also important as a\ncontribution to the understanding of enzyme-catalyzed\nreactions, since it has been suggested that enzymatic C\u2212H\nPage 31 of 50 Ch mical Society Reviews"

            "text": "As emphasized in the Introduction section of this article,\nexamples of QMT-driven reactions involving the motion of light\nhydrogen atoms are relatively abundant and this phenomenon\nhas been recognized to play an important role in organic\nchemistry, biochemistry, and catalysis [86-90]. Because the\ntunneling probabilities decrease exponentially with the square\nroot of the moving mass, atoms heavier than hydrogen were for\nlong assumed to behave essentially classically [90]. However,\nrecent evidence indicates that heavy-atom QMT can have\nsignificant implications for many chemical reactions [91,92].\nAbout a dozen of examples of direct spectroscopic observation\nof carbon-atom QMT occurring under matrix isolation\nconditions have been reported [92-96]. In recent investigations,\nwe have also discovered a new and distinctive case of a heavy-\natom QMT reaction involving the displacement of both nitrogen\nand oxygen atoms [97].\nThe 2-formyl-3-fuorophenylazide precursor, which was\ndesigned to achieve stabilization of the syn-aldehyde\nconformation, allows generation of the corresponding triplet\nsyn-2-formylarylnitrene upon UV-irradiation under cryogenic\nconditions. Once produced, this nitrene species was observed\nto spontaneously cyclize to the corresponding singlet\n2,1-benzisoxazole (Figure 21). The experimental IR spectrum of\nthe consumed and produced species is well reproduced by the\nB3LYP/6-311+G(2d,p) computed IR spectra, providing unequi-\nvocal identification for the occurrence of such cyclization\nreaction (Figure 22). The reaction kinetics was measured in the\ndark in an argon matrix at 10, 15 and 20 K, and rate constants of 1.4 \u00d7 10\u22123 s\u22121 were obtained. The observation of a fast and\ntemperature-independent cyclization rate at those low\ntemperatures provided convincing evidence for the occurrence\nof a heavy-atom QMT cyclization [97].\nA reaction mechanism involving heavy-atom QMT on the triplet\nsurface was excluded, because the triplet state of the product\nis energetically higher than the triplet state of the reactant. A\nminimum energy crossing point (MECP) between the triplet\nnitrene and singlet benzisoxazole surfaces was found at 50 kJ mol\u22121. Such large reaction energy requirement is clearly\nprohibitive to be achieved by a classical process at the cryogenic\ntemperatures of the experiment. On the other hand, a spin-\nforbidden heavy-atom QMT rate calculated by nonadiabatic\ntransition state theory (NA-TST) using the weak coupling (WC)\nmodel, at the MRMP(10,10)//CASSCF(10,10) or M06-2X levels\nof theory, provides a qualitative agreement with the\nexperimental values, supporting the exclusive existence of a\nPage 32 of 50Ch mical Society Reviews"

To the best of our\nknowledge, the WC formulation of nonadiabatic-TST was for the\nfirst time successfully applied in this study to calculate\nvibrational ground state QMT reactions rates.\nWe also recently unveiled a new reactivity paradigm in this area\nby demonstrating that a well-defined chemical starting material\nspontaneously decay at cryogenic temperatures into two\ndifferent products via two competitive heavy-atom QMT\nprocesses [98]. After generation of 4-amino-2H-benzazirine in\nan argon matrix (3\u221218 K), this species was observed to\nconcomitantly undergo spontaneous ring-opening to a triplet\nnitrene and ring-expansion to a cyclic ketenimine (Figure 23).\nThe process was monitored by IR spectroscopy, which allows\nthe identification of these two products by comparison with\ntheir IR spectra signature (obtained during UV-irradiation\nexperiments starting from an azide precursor), and the\nidentification of the consumed benzazirine with the support of\nits B3LYP/6 311+G(2d,p) computed IR spectrum (Figure 24). The\nreaction kinetic was measured at 3, 10 and 18 K, and rate constants of 5.5 \u00d7 10\u22125, 6.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 and 7.0 \u00d7 10\u22125 s\u22121,\nrespectively, were obtained. The observed triplet nitrene : cyclic\nketenimine product ratio was 15:85 (3 K), 18:82 (10 K) and\n17:83 (18 K). The evidence that the reaction rate is nearly\nconstant upon increasing of the temperature by a factor of five\nand that the product rate practically did not change confirmed\nthat the observed benzazirine transformations were due to two\nindependent and competitive heavy-atom tunneling reactions\nThe ring-opening mechanism of 4-amino-2H-benzazirine should\ninvolve the formation of the corresponding open-shell singlet\n(OSS) nitrene, followed by fast ISC to triplet nitrene ground\nstate. Due to the need of using multi-configurational methods\nto correctly described OSS nitrenes, such transformation was\ncomputed at NEVPT2(8,8)//CASSCF(8,8) level and an energy barrier of 10.5 kJ mol\u22121 was estimated. The ring-expansion\nmechanism of 4-amino-2H-benzazirine to the corresponding\ncyclic ketenimine was found to be most reliably computed at\nthe CCSD(T)//B3LYP level, and an energy barrier of 30.5 kJ mol\u22121 was estimated (Figure 25). According to the classic TST,\neven such low energy barriers are prohibitive at the cryogenic\ntemperatures of the experiment. Moreover, the formation of\ncyclic ketenimine as major product, having a higher energy\nbarrier than the minor nitrene product, contradicts the rules\ninferred from classic TST. Therefore, it becomes clear that a\nthermal over-the-barrier process cannot explain the observed\ntransformation but only the occurrence of heavy-atom QMT\ndominated by tunneling control. Indeed, computed tunneling\nprobabilities through those two barriers (applying the Wentzel-\nKramers-Brillouin formalism), predict the existence of two\ncompetitive reactions of the benzazirine, in line with the\nexperimental observations. Computations also show that for\nthe tunneling of the benzazirine to the nitrene the nitrogen\natom in the three-membered ring is clearly the heavy-atom with\nthe largest displacement, whereas for the tunneling of the\nbenzazirine to the ketenimine the two carbon atoms in the\nthree-membered ring have by far the largest displacement [98].\nTherefore, they support a case for the existence of competitive\nnitrogen vs. carbon QMT reactions occurring simultaneously\nwith 4-amino-2H-benzazirine as the reactant species.\nPage 33 of 50 Ch mical Society Reviews"

            "text": "Along the previous sections, we have surveyed the major\nprogresses in the field of IR-induced and tunneling-driven\nchemistry for matrix isolated species. As mentioned in the\nIntroduction section, we focused essentially on our own\ncontributions to develop vibrationally induced chemistry as a\npowerful tool to manipulate molecular structures in a highly\nselective way, and to use and control QMT as a tool to explore\nthe reactivity of organic molecules in an unprecedented way.\nFigure 26 provides a timeline graph that summarizes these\nmajor achievements in a historical perspective.\nWe have showed that using tunable narrowband IR-light and\nmatrix isolation conditions, it is possible to manipulate the\nstructure and reactivity of chosen molecular species in a very\nselective way. This methodology has been applied successfully\nto trigger conformational isomerizations in a different range of\norganic compounds, including weakly-bonded (dimeric)\nspecies. Noteworthy, the feasibility to produce high-energy\nconformers of different species by vibrational excitation, which\notherwise are not accessible to experimentation, opened the\ngate to new fascinating investigations such as conformational\nselective chemistry or the synthesis of unusual high-energy\ncrystals composed by rare conformers.\nFrom the first cases studied, where the IR-induced\nconformational isomerizations comprised changes in the\nmoiety where the vibrational excitation was applied or in an\nadjacent bond, we and others expanded the scope of the\ntechnique to consider also reversible interconversions between\nconformers by vibrational excitation of a group (having the role\nof an antenna) remotely located from the fragment undergoing\nconformational changes. Moreover, we have demonstrated\nthat different antennas can be used in an interchangeable way\nto trigger conformational isomerizations of the same remote\nmolecular fragment.\nOur recent demonstration that vibrational excitation can be\nused to induce bond-breaking/bond-forming reactions for\nmatrix-isolated organic molecules established a new domain in\nvibrationally-driven chemistry. Furthermore, envisioning a\ngeneralized strategy to guide a variety of chemical reactions\nusing IR light, we demonstrated as proof-of-principle the\ntriggering of an electrocyclic reaction by vibrational excitation\nof an antenna remotely located in relation to the reaction\ncenter. We expect that future studies using target molecules\nwith more than one vibrational antenna and more than one\npossible reaction coordinates will give fundamental answers\nregarding the relation between the nature of the excited mode\nand the activated reactions. By introducing vibrational energy\nin a molecule in an amount above the threshold required to\ninduce different transformations, the possibility to activate a\nhigher-energy pathway, so that it can effectively compete with\na lower-energy one, is a problem currently under study in our\nlaboratories. Such investigations can be expected to strongly\nexpand the power of IR-induced processes for more practically\noriented uses and provide important hints regarding\nintramolecular vibrational energy redistribution in different\ntypes of molecular systems.\nUp until quite recently, all IR-induced processes carried out for\nmatrix isolated species resorted on the vibrational excitation of\nfundamental vibrations or first overtones (or combination\nmodes) of favorable stretching modes, such as that of an OH\ngroup. A significant progress was achieved when we\ndemonstrated that selective vibrational excitation of second\novertone modes, 3\u03bd(OH), also successfully triggers\nconformational isomerizations in the target molecules. Such\napproach allows to introduce much more energy in a molecule [120 kJ mol\u20131 for 3\u03bd(OH) vs. 80 kJ mol\u20131 for 2\u03bd(OH)] and,\ntherefore, offer prospects to control the manipulation of\nchemical species stable even at temperatures close to room\ntemperature. In conjugation with our recent breakthrough on\ninducing bond-breaking/bond-forming reactions by infrared\nvibrational excitation and the demonstration of the feasibility of\nsuch approach also to neat solid conditions, we might foresee\nthe development of this methodology to achieve the activation\nof drugs in vivo or the switch of materials in optical and\nelectronic devices in a highly controlled and selective way, not\nattainable by thermal and electronic excitation.\nWe have also shown here that IR-induced processes in\ncryogenic matrices are frequently entangled with tunneling-\ndriven reactions. Several investigations on direct spectroscopic\nobservation of spontaneous conformational isomerizations of\nhigh-energy conformers (produced by vibrational excitation of\nlower energy forms) at cryogenic temperatures have provided\nimportant data to improve our knowledge of fundamental\nprinciples of the QMT phenomenon. Interestingly, some studies\nhave unrevealed the occurrence of vibrationally-assisted QMT\nprocesses, by showing that conformational isomerizations can\ntake place even when the vibration excitation energy\nintroduced in the target conformer is below that corresponding\nto the isomerization energy barrier. As described in details\nabove, more recently, we have demonstrated how to switch on\nH-atom QMT by IR-induced conformation control. To the best\nof our knowledge, such approach represented the first ever\nachievement of the control of tunneling by means of external\nradiation. We can expect future advances in such new\nconceptual strategy to harness the control of QMT, which will\nbe likely to inspire progress in the fields of enzymatic catalysis\nand quantum switches, and to provide new avenues for\ndirecting chemical transformations.\nContributing to a paradigm shift, we and others have been\nreported direct spectroscopic observation of heavy-atom QMT\nreactions in cryogenic matrices, in this way demonstrating that\nthis phenomenon can have much more significant implications\nin chemical reactivity than previously thought. Although most\nexamples comprise carbon-atom QMT, we have also discovered\na distinctive case of a heavy-atom QMT reaction involving the\ndisplacement of both nitrogen and oxygen atoms. One can\nexpect that future studies will extend the limits of observed\nQMT to even heavier elements, such as fluorine. Besides, we\nhave also unraveled a new, fascinating reactivity pattern, by\ndemonstrating a unique case of two competitive heavy-atom\nQMT reactions (nitrogen vs. carbon) occurring simultaneously\nfrom a well-defined chemical starting material, leading to two\nPage 34 of 50Ch mical Society Reviews"

This paradigmatic example offers an\nexcellent opportunity to investigate how electronic effects\nimposed internally by different substituents or externally by\ndifferent media can tune the selectivity of a QMT reaction.\nElectronic effects will most likely affect QMT differently than an\nover-the-barrier process, rationalized by classical TST, and,\ntherefore, new fundamental understanding will likely emerge\nfrom such studies. Due to the recent progress witness on the\nfield of QMT reactions, we foresee their entrance in synthetic\norganic chemistry and synthetic planning disciplines for the very\nnear future. In this way, new reactivity paradigms and synthetic\nstrategies will likely emerge under more conventional\nlaboratory conditions, opening new avenues for the design of\nnew molecules.\nThis is the story of a still ongoing endeavor, and by this reason\nnecessarily an incomplete (but opportune) story.
