    "abstractText": "The prevalence of dance-related injuries is high, yet risk factors remain unclear in modern dance. The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the continuity and nature of dance programs. The objectives were to investigate factors associated with musculoskeletal injuries in pre-professional modern dancers before and after the pandemic and to qualitatively describe the dancers\u2019 experiences during COVID-19. We examined 31 modern dancers (19.42 \u00b1 1.57 years) pre-COVID-19 and reexamined 21 participants after one-year post-COVID-19, using objective physical tests for upper and lower body strength, aerobic fitness, hip ranges, injury history, and training hours\u2019 data. The injury rate remained mostly unaffected (0.87 \u00b1 0.88 pre-, 0.76 \u00b1 0.83 post-COVID-19), but weekly dance hours were reduced (33 pre-, 21.40 post-COVID-19). Dancers significantly improved their push-up score (p = 0.016) and decreased their compensated turnout (p = 0.022). Notably, non-injured dancers scored higher in the pre-COVID-19 Chester Step Test (p = 0.033) and practiced more strength training independently post-COVID-19 (p = 0.024). No significant differences were found between injured and non-injured dancers in the other parameters. Dancers reported negative thoughts and difficulty maintaining their fitness during the pandemic. In conclusion, strength training and aerobic fitness were identified as potentially important factors related to injury risk in modern dance and should be examined further for their injury prevention value.",

            "text": "Professional dancing requires heavy physical exertion, fine motor control for technical skills, and physical fitness. Modern dancers depend on choreographic requirements, which often vary in character and combine floor-based movements, partner maneuvers, and frequent use of weight bearing on the upper extremities [1]. Modern dance is mainly an interval type exercise [2] involving short periods of activity, but the overall duration of classes and rehearsals is often extended, which is why good aerobic fitness seems important for dancers to endure long hours of activity. Moreover, a high anaerobic threshold can limit the harmful effects of lactate accumulation during dance activities [3].\nAppl. Sci. 2023, 13, 3018. https://doi.org/10.3390/app13053018 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/applsci\nThus, professional dance significantly affects the dancers\u2019 physical requirements [3]. Pre-professional programs in Israel include full-time dance training, designed to resemble the technical demands and intensity in professional dance companies. These programs in Israel are similar to non-academic college programs, include auditions, and are attended by dancers who wish to become professional dancers. These programs extend over one to two years, with nine months of annual activity. This includes daily high-level classes of ballet and modern, as well as repertoire classes, rehearsals, and performances. However, the physical demands of ballet and modern dance differ, and research on ballet dancers cannot be generalized to all dancers [1]. Despite the high physical demands imposed on both dancers and athletes, it seems that the nature of dance training lacks the application of training principles that are well established in sports [4]. Dance lessons focus on technique and choreography, while sports aim to combine skill training with strength training and aerobic (i.e., cardiorespiratory) fitness. The reported incidence of injuries among dancers is higher when compared to elite artistic gymnasts and varies greatly between studies (0.77\u20134.71 vs. 2.63 injuries per 1000 training hours, respectively) [5\u20137]. The most common areas of injury reported in modern dance students were the ankle/foot (30%), lower back (15%), and the knee (14%) [8]. Similar frequencies were reported among pre-professional ballet dancers [9]. Above 75% of injuries were in the lower limb, with more than half of them in the ankle/foot, and 16% involved the trunk (mainly the lower back). Previous studies suggest several risk factors for injuries in dance. These include lower vertical jumps in pre-professional and professional female modern dancers [10] and low aerobic fitness in female ballet dancers [11]. During modern dance classes and rehearsal, heart rates (HR) rarely reach the aerobic training zone [2], and HR indices are significantly lower in class than during dance performances. Professional female modern dancers reached higher levels of VO2max than their counterparts in ballet, reflecting higher aerobic fitness. Yet, this was not shown for male dancers at any level in modern or ballet dance [3]. A systematic review reported the history of injuries in pre-professional ballet and modern dancers as a risk factor [5], but aerobic capacity, training hours, and demographics were not shown to be risk factors. Greater compensated turnout and greater functional turnout were found in injured dancers when compared to non-injured dancers [12]. Functional turnout is the angle between the feet in the first position of ballet [13]. Hips are externally rotated when standing, while thighs, knees, and heels are close together. Compensated turnout is the difference between the functional turnout and the total range of passive hip external rotation motion for both hips [13]. If a dancer externally rotates their hips alone without compensating from adjacent joints, the compensated turnout range is zero. There are various methodological limitations to research of injury risk factors in modern dancers. Methodological differences exist between studies, and most research regarding risk factors exclusively investigates ballet [1,7,12]; research is scant in modern dance [10]. The population is partly non-homogeneous, and the use of objective tests and uniform definitions of injury is lacking [5,12]. Therefore, knowledge regarding injury prevention in modern dance is needed [5,12,14] to advance the development of pre-season screening and training planning. The pandemic caused by the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) had begun to spread in Israel in March 2020, which coincided with this study\u2019s first data collection. Gathering restrictions and lockdowns interrupted the daily routine in the cultural and creative sector, including professional and pre-professional dance. To maintain some continuity, dance programs began conducting online classes; however, the activity varied in scope throughout the year, and dancers frequently experienced transitions between the studio and online classes. It is clear that this pandemic has damaged dance dramatically, but the exact effects of activity changes on dance injuries following this period remains unknown. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first attempt to shed light on this by targeting two objectives: (a) to investigate which self-reported and physical measures\nare associated with musculoskeletal injuries among pre-professional modern dancers; and (b) to compare these measures before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Further, this study provides a qualitative description of the physical, mental, and artistic effects on dancers due to COVID-19 restrictions, and the self-reported reasons for injuries by dancers. Findings from this work may highlight the missing physical components in structured dance training and may further our understanding of the multifaceted effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on dancers."

For the followup, dancers who continued to dance in any setting (e.g., the original training program, a professional dance company, or independently) were assessed one year later. The exclusion criteria comprised: (1) Dancers who were ill or otherwise unavailable on the assessment date, and (2) those with significant medical issues (e.g., surgery, a medically required break from dance, neurological disorders, rheumatologic, cardiopulmonary or metabolic disease). In addition, dancers who participated in the baseline assessment but quit dancing afterwards were excluded from the one-year follow-up."

All participants were initially contacted by phone to screen for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Prior to their physical exam, dancers provided informed consent. This study was approved by the University of Haifa ethics committee (#406/19). The study consisted of two 45 minute physical assessments conducted by two certified physiotherapists visiting the dance studio: A baseline assessment (pre-COVID-19) and a one-year-later follow-up assessment (post-COVID-19). The objective physical tests were followed by a one-on-one interview based on Dance UK\u2019s injury questionnaire [15] to collect self-reported data on demographics, anthropometrics, physical activity, and injury history. The physical tests were conducted prior to the injury information collection to avoid bias from the two examiners while assessing the objective metrics. Injury data collection was conducted at five different time points: (T1) Baseline assessment (pre-COVID-19), during which the dancers were asked about injuries in the past year. (T2, T3) Monthly record after the first and second months of dance activity via an online questionnaire. (T4) Monthly record after the third month of activity via a 20\u201330 min long video conference due to COVID-19 restrictions, which reviewed the physical activity and injuries of the last three months. When dancers reported an injury, they were requested to provide any medical documentation available [12]. Monthly injury data collection was halted due to the COVID-19 outbreak and the lockdowns. Finally, (T5) was a one-year in-person follow-up assessment (post-COVID-19) to gather injury information from the third follow-up (T4) to this point. In T5, dancers were re-examined according to the first session protocol. To capture the effect of the pandemic on the dancers, they were asked a new open question: \u201cHow did the COVID-19 pandemic affect you as a dancer?\u201d"

The Sargent Jump Test is a valid and reliable test (Cronbach\u2019s alpha = 0.96, ICC = 0.96) for explosive power in the lower limbs, which measures jumping height in centimeters from a standing position [17]. The test was performed according to the protocol described by Harman et al. [18]. 2. The Heel-Raise Test assesses functional ankle strength by the number of heel-raise repetitions for each leg [19,20]. The test was found reliable (ICC = 0.78\u20130.84) with similar reliability as in isokinetic tests [19]. Test protocol was conducted as described by H\u00e9bert-Losier et al. [20], with the dancers standing barefoot on the floor. 3. The Push-Up Test assesses upper limb strength by the number of push-up repetitions to fatigue, based on Baumgartner et al.\u2019s protocol [21]. The dancers\u2019 feet were placed together, and palms were positioned at approximately shoulder width. One push-up was counted when the dancers\u2019 chests touched the five-centimeter height cone in the lower position and then raised up to the straight arms position. The test was found to be valid and highly reliable [21]. 4. The Chester Step Test is a valid test for aerobic capacity in healthy adults, highly correlated to VO2max [22]. In the test we measured HR during stepping on and off a 30-centimeter step to exertion [22]. We followed Sykes and Roberts\u2019 protocol [22], using an audio file to dictate the cadence. We used a Polar H7 chest strap and the smartphone application Beat to monitor HR. The Polar H7 sensor was found to be in agreement with the electrocardiogram (rc = 0.996) for assessing HR metrics during aerobic exercises [23]. 5. Hip Range of Motion (ROM) was measured in degrees using a goniometer, which was found reliable in healthy adults (ICC = 0.76\u20130.97) [24,25]. Hip ROM measures are known dance injury risk factors [12]. We measured passive and functional ROM for this study:\n(a) Passive range for hip external rotation was measured for each leg when sitting on a firm table [25]. (b) Functional turnout was measured standing on a piece of paper in ballet\u2019s first position. The functional turnout consisted of the angle formed by the longitudinal bisection of the feet [13]. (c) Compensated turnout was calculated as the functional turnout minus the bilateral passive hip external rotation ROM [13]."

We used Paired t-tests to evaluate the pre- to post-COVID-19 change. Comparison of subjective and physical measures between injured and non-injured dancers was performed using a two-sample T-test, and a Pearson chi-square test, both pre- and post-COVID-19. We conducted a series of univariate Poisson regression models [26] in which period rate of injury (pre- or post-COVID-19) was related to each single physical test (taken in the relevant period). Following these univariate analyses, if any of the test results significantly predicted the rate of injuries, a multivariable model was applied to explore whether the\nsignificant factor remained significant when adjusted for demographic measures, such as dance years, past injury, and gender. Statistical analysis was performed using the SAS software (version 9.4, Raleigh, NC, USA)."

At T5, 21 of the 31 dancers were reassessed. Twelve dancers had continued in the original training program, four joined a new training program, and five joined professional dance companies. Four dancers had tested positive for COVID-19 during that one year, suffered from mild symptoms, and continued their activity routine without difficulty after recovery. Eighteen dancers reported having been in one or two quarantines, and three dancers reported never having experienced a COVID-19 quarantine.

            "text": "3.7.1. Dancers\u2019 Views on Pandemic Effects\nIn our one-year follow-up assessment, we conducted an interview to cover the dancers\u2019 experience during the pandemic. Table 3 summarizes the dancers\u2019 responses to: \u201cHow did COVID-19 affect you as a dancer?\u201d Answers were both positively and negatively categorized into physical, mental, and artistic effects. Responses given by more than a third of the dancers are bolded.\n3.7.2. Dancers\u2019 Self-Perception of Injury Causes\nIn the fourth injury data collection (T4), dancers answered an open-ended question about the cause of their injuries. Their answers are detailed in Table 4.\nThis study provides a qualitative description of self-reported mental, emotional, and professional effects on dancers during the COVID-19 period. A total of eight out of 21 dancers reported negative feelings of loneliness, depression, and lowered self-confidence. This impression is in line with reports of common mental health complaints reported among performing arts students in the Netherlands during COVID-19 [27]. Insufficient mental coping skills were identified by previous studies as a risk factor for dance injuries [5,28], and pre-professional dancers already face high physical and psychological demands during regular times. In addition, COVID-19 confronted dancers with a serious threat to their professional future. We hope these reported effects might raise awareness of the insecure status dancers have encountered recently and ideally emphasize the need for mental support. The dancers also reported some specific positive aspects. They felt more at ease with the decrease in dance intensity and reported that it helped in recovery [27], improved flexibility, and opened new opportunities for creativity. The lower injury incidence postCOVID-19 can be explained by allowing more recovery time in a less demanding period. The dancers related injuries to a high and intensive workload, to working their bodies too hard, and to not practicing strength training outside of dance classes. Accordingly, it can be assumed that the dancers themselves identified a connection between injuries and fatigue [29] as well as reduced strength, and that they may have understood the importance of adequate rest and strength training. Similar COVID-19 effects were reported in students from China and the Netherlands, who self-reported a decrease in stress and an improvement in sleep time and quality [27,29]."

            "text": "This prospective study monitored dance injuries in relation to strength, aerobic fitness, hip mobility, injury history, and training hours, and followed the effects of the pandemic on dancers. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study following objective measures in pre-professional modern dancers, before and after the COVID-19 outbreak. Our main findings demonstrate that participation in strength training and higher baseline aerobic fitness differentiated non-injured from injured dancers. In other words, dancers who practiced strength training independently and in addition to dance during the pandemic were not injured pre- or post-COVID-19. In addition, dancers who showed higher aerobic performance in the pre-COVID-19 Chester Step Test reported no injuries preCOVID-19, with a similar trend post-COVID-19. The dancers who practiced cardiovascular training independently apart from dance were less injured. These findings are in agreement with a systematic review examining elite female ballet dancers [30]. Reduced strength in the lower limbs and poor aerobic fitness were found to be risk factors for lower limb injury. Other studies in pre-professional and professional contemporary dancers conducted strength and aerobic exercise programs ranging from 1.5 to 6 months, with 2\u20133 sessions of 1\u20131.5 h/week [31\u201333]. These programs demonstrated a positive response to the training in the measures of aerobic fitness and improved lower body muscular power and strength [31\u201333]. Two studies were controlled [31,33], and neither investigated injuries [31\u201333]. In contrast, Roussel et al.\u2019s [16] randomized controlled trial did not find a positive effect of a four-month aerobic and strength intervention program for\npre-professional dancers on injuries, apart from a reduction in pain and lower-back injuries, when compared to educational sessions [16]. Aerobic training for dancers has some evidence to support its benefits. Aerobic exercise accelerates recovery [34], decreases pain perception, and improves mood [35]. Dance is heterogenic in its aerobic demands. In modern and ballet classes, HR was mainly below the aerobic training zone [36]. During center-class work, HR and oxygen uptake were higher than in the warm-up [37]. Performances demanded the highest HR levels. Professional modern dancers who often engaged in performances demonstrated lower HR in recovery, lower peak HR, and better aerobic fitness when compared to pre-professional modern dancers [38]. Therefore, there is a functional and physiological need for performing dancers to acquire aerobic fitness. Dance classes do not seem sufficient to improve dancers\u2019 aerobic fitness and strength [36,39], let alone prepare them for the high demands of performances [2,38]. Physical and mental fatigue may play a role in injury propensity [10,29]. Current results suggest that better strength and aerobic capacity potentially elevates the threshold for fatigue in dancers [10]. Further research, including high-quality randomized controlled trials, is needed to specify aerobic and strength training recommendations in relation to injuries [36,38]. The decrease in dancing time during the COVID-19 pandemic enabled dancers to add aerobic and strength training, but not all utilized this opportunity. We found no association between the number of dance hours and injuries post-COVID-19, which aligns with previous studies in professional contemporary dance companies [40,41]. Overall, our findings align with previous results [21,42], demonstrating that modern dancers are weaker than other athletes in the upper limbs. Moreover, ~30% of this study\u2019s injuries involved the shoulders and spine. This highlights the need to examine upper limb strength and endurance as reflected in the Push-Up Test.\nLimitations\nThis study has limitations. We did not reach the planned sample size due to the initial lockdown in Israel, which was due to the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which caused a lack of continuity and uncertainty of the dance programs\u2019 existence. Participation changed throughout the study. Initially, dancers were happy to participate and examine their physical condition, but during the pandemic we experienced multiple dropouts due to uncertainty and instability in the professional dance world. We found that training programs did not have a designated clinician on board. Each dancer has a different health insurance cover and investigators cannot access medical records. Therefore, the dancers\u2019 injury data were mostly self-reported, similar to previous research [14]. Moreover, future studies should reconsider the definition of injury in this context. Many dance injuries stem from overuse and may not always lead to a loss of dancing time, and injury that did not lead to reduced dance time was not counted in our study. Due to the changes throughout the year in dance activity and heterogeneity in the dancers\u2019 participation, a full report of the additional activity the dancers practiced beyond dance is limited. Still, strength training and aerobic fitness significantly differentiated in injured and non-injured dancers."

            "text": "The main two findings of this original study in dancers showed that non-injured participants demonstrated higher aerobic capacity and performed more strength training than injured dancers. Therefore, pre-professional dance programs should consider adapting their methods and integrating aerobic and strength training in their curriculum. Future research should explore how evidence-based sports training methods aid in reducing injury rate.\nAuthor Contributions: L.K. and H.S.B. were major contributors to the study in all aspects, including the experimental design, data analysis, and manuscript preparation.
