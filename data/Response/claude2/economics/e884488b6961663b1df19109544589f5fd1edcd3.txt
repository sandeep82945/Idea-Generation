 Here are 5 potential future research ideas after reading this paper:

1. Examine the effects of changing crop varieties and planting dates on wheat production under climate change scenarios. The paper assumed constant varieties and planting dates, but farmers may adapt these in the future. 

2. Incorporate projections of other major crops like rice and maize to give a more comprehensive view of future food production in China. The paper only looked at wheat.

3. Expand the analysis to other key wheat-producing regions globally to understand climate change impacts on global wheat supplies. The paper focused only on China.

4. Use more sophisticated population projection models that account for fertility, mortality, migration rates rather than just logistic regression. This could improve population estimates.

5. Conduct similar analyses for other key staple crops globally to determine if production can meet future demand under climate and population changes. This could reveal vulnerable regions.
