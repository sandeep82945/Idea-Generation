    "abstractText": "In this paper, we quantify the physical layer security of a dual-hop regenerative relaying-based wireless communication system assisted by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). In particular, the setup consists of a source node communicating with a destination node via a regenerative relay. In this setup, a RIS is installed in each hop to increase the sourcerelay and relay-destination communications reliability, where the RISs\u2019 phase shifts are subject to quantization errors. The legitimate transmission is performed under the presence of a malicious eavesdropper attempting to compromise the legitimate transmissions by overhearing the broadcasted signal from the relay. To overcome this problem, we incorporate a jammer to increase the system\u2019s secrecy by disrupting the eavesdropper through a broadcasted jamming signal. Leveraging the welladopted Gamma and Exponential distributions approximations, the system\u2019s secrecy level is quantified by deriving approximate and asymptotic expressions of the secrecy intercept probability (IP) metric in terms of the main network parameters. The results show that the secrecy is enhanced significantly by increasing the jamming power and/or the number of reflective elements (REs). In particular, an IP of approximately 10\u22124 can be reached with 40 REs and 10 dB of jamming power-to-noise ratio even when the legitimate links\u2019 average signal-to-noise ratios are 10-dB less than the eavesdropper\u2019s one. We show that cooperative jamming is very helpful in strong eavesdropping scenarios with a fixed number of REs, and the number of quantization bits does not influence the secrecy when exceeding 3 bits. All the analytical results are endorsed by Monte Carlo simulations.",

INTRODUCTION\nThe past few decades witnessed significant efforts on designing ultra-reliable, self-sustainable, and secure communications, pillars representing the main targets of the 5G and beyond and 6G visions [2], [3]. In fact, information security has always been a de facto concern in wireless transmissions due to their broadcast nature [4]. To date, the implementation of security mechanisms on wireless communication systems (WCSs) has been viewed almost exclusively from higher layers by grasping the key-based cryptographic algorithms [4]. However, while these algorithms provide the required security\nThis paper was submitted in part to BalkanCom 2022 [1]. This research was sponsored in part by the NATO Science for Peace and Security Programme under grant SPS G5797. E. Illi, M. K. Qaraqe, and S. M. Al-Kuwari are with the College of Science and Engineering, Hamad Bin Khalifa University, Qatar Foundation, Doha, Qatar. (e-mails: elmehdi.illi@ieee.org, {mqaraqe, smalkuwari}@hbku.edu.qa).\nF. El Bouanani is with ENSIAS College of Engineering, Mohammed V University of Rabat, Morocco. (e-mail: f.elbouanani@um5s.net.ma).\nfor devices with sufficient transmit power and computing facilities onboard [5], the emergence of new wireless paradigms, such as the internet of things (IoT) and vehicular communications renders current cryptographic schemes unsuited for such power-limited and processing-restricted technologies [6]. Furthermore, the forecasted sizeable amount of data traffic is expected to bring unprecedented privacy leakages [7].\nRecently, physical layer security (PLS) has been gaining significant attention from both academia and industry communities. Unlike the conventional key-based cryptographic schemes, PLS establishes secure transmissions leveraging exclusively the physical layer parameters (e.g., fading, channel coding, interference, etc) [8], [9] in order to provide a noisy legitimate signal copy to the eavesdropper (i.e., increasing its equivocation). The secrecy capacity is PLS\u2019s cornerstone, for which higher values correspond to an improved system\u2019s security level from the physical layer point of view. To this end, PLS can effectively contribute to providing acceptable security levels with a much-reduced overhead in comparison with the traditional cryptographic schemes [5].\nRegular WCSs consist of a transmitter sending an information-bearing signal to a receiver through an uncontrollable propagation medium. This signal reaches the destination via several replicas through multiple reflection paths, producing random fading [10]. However, futuristic wireless networks such as the 6G are envisioned to adopt the Smart Radio Environment, where every network component can adapt to the changes in the environment [11]. To this end, considerable attention has been paid in the yesteryears to the Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) technology as a key enabler to spectrum and energy efficiency\u2019s boosting [12]. A RIS is a man-made metasurface consisting of a large number of lowcost passive reflecting elements (REs), where each of which can tune its phase shift to adapt to the incident electromagnetic wave impinging its surface. As a result, such reflected signal copies can be constructively/destructively superposed at the intended/unintended node to maximize/minimize the received signal power; a process that resembles the well-known MIMO beamforming [13].\nThe inherent capabilities of RISs and metasurfaces in reshaping the propagation environment have driven intuitive insights into exploiting these features in favor of boosting the system\u2019s secrecy. As illegitimate network users can benefit from different signal qualities, which poses serious eavesdropping threats, RIS can be used to effectively choose optimal phase shifts in favor of the legitimate user; i.e., beamsteer the\nar X\niv :2\n20 8.\n01 72\n6v 1\n[ cs\n.I T\n] 2\nA ug\n2 02\n2\ninformation signal to the genuine user with a higher power, while providing the eavesdropper with a lower signal power.\nA. Related Work The corresponding literature of related work involving PLS and RIS has done a substantial contribution to the subject so far. In particular, the authors in [14] consider the PLS of a two-way multi-user RIS-assisted transmission for which a user scheduling scheme was proposed. In [15], the secrecy level of a RIS-assisted WCS was tackled where a direct link between the transmitter and the receiver was considered. In [16], the authors carried out a PLS analysis of a RIS-based two-users non-orthogonal multiple access network. Similarily, the work in [17] inspected the security performance of a RIS-aided network with an uncertain eavesdropper location. Moreover, several work dealt with the secrecy maximization problem by optimizing the RIS and system parameters. For instance, the authors in [18] formulated a secrecy rate-maximization problem under the RIS-assisted system constraints and proposed an efficient algorithm for solving the optimization problem. Similarly, an energy-efficiency secure transmission problem for a multi-antenna source RIS-assisted multi-user network was formulated in [19] with the probabilistic outage constraint. In addition, the authors in [20] formulated a secrecy-rate maximization problem of a non-orthogonal unicast-multicast network, where alternate optimization-based solutions were adopted for optimizing the non-orthogonal power splitting and RIS\u2019s phase shifts. M. H. Khosafa et al. inspected the secrecy performance of a RIS-assisted device-to-device WCS subject to interference from another cellular user [21]. Also, a comprehensive secrecy analysis for similar RIS-assisted WCSs in distinct setups was carried out in other work such as [13], [14], [22] and references therein.\nB. Motivation Although the aforementioned work brought interesting contributions on the PLS analysis and optimization of RIS-aided WCSs, they were constrained by the assumption of error-free phase shift estimation and quantization. In fact, reaching a high-precision configuration for the RIS is impractical [23]. The authors in [23] provided a bit error probability analysis of a RIS-assisted system subject to phase estimation and quantization errors. Importantly, S\u00e1nchez et al. assessed the secrecy performance analysis of a RIS-based network subject to the presence of phase estimation and quantization errors [24]. Furthermore, the work in [25], [26] extended the secrecy analysis of such a WCS by considering phase estimation and quantization errors along with multiple eavesdroppers under the presence and absence of a direct link, respectively. On the other hand, a limited number of work in the literature analyzed the interplay between conventional dual/multi-hop relaying techniques and RIS when incorporated together on a transmission system. Differently from the RIS principle, relaying techniques actively process the signal by either amplifying it (amplify-and-forward (AF)), or decoding it (decode-andforward (DF)), before handing it to the next relay or destination node. To this end, work such as [27]\u2013[29] aimed to amalgamate the benefits of both RIS and active relaying schemes\non the PLS. In [27], the authors assessed the PLS analysis of a three-hop mixed visible light communication/radio-frequency (RF) WCS whereby a RIS is used to assist the second hop (i.e., RF channel). Furthermore, the authors of [28] aimed at optimizing both RIS phase shifts and relay selection in a multirelay dual-hop network through deep reinforcement learning, where a RIS was involved to assist both hops. The secrecy level of a mixed RF-underwater optical WCS was quantified in [29] with a single RIS assisting the first RF hop, under the presence of a single eavesdropper.\nCombining RIS and cooperative relaying schemes has been appealing in a multi-hop scenario; e.g., wireless mesh network [30]; where the different relaying transceivers can be located in a non-line-of-sight environment. This motivates the implementation of numerous RISs to accommodate reliable transmissions. On the other hand, the inclusion of cooperative jamming/artificial noise has been shown to provide significant improvement in system secrecy. Importantly, several works such as [21], [31] analyzed and discussed the interplay between RIS and jamming schemes in enhancing the PLS of WCSs. Therefore, it is crucial to provide a comprehensive PLS analysis of dual-hop relay-based networks assisted by RIS along with jamming, by considering phase estimation and/or quantization errors.\nC. Contributions\nMotivated by the above, we aim in this paper at analyzing the secrecy performance of a dual-hop RIS and jamming-aided WCS. Particularly, two multi-element RISs are involved to assist the transmission of each of the two hops, i.e. sourcerelay and relay-destination, where the DF relaying scheme is implemented at the relay. In addition to this, a malicious eavesdropper is attempting to overhear the signal broadcasted by the relay and reflected by the second RIS. Additionally, a jammer is incorporated to deceive the eavesdropper by injecting a jamming signal, assumed to be canceled perfectly at the legitimate destination. Lastly, the RIS-assisted transmission is assumed to be subject to phase quantization errors (PQEs). The current work differs from [24]\u2013[29] where the PLS analysis was carried out by considering either perfect phase estimation and quantization or dual-hop relaying, while the involvement of cooperative jamming was not considered. To the best of our knowledge, the current work is the first of its kind to inspect the joint influence of the DF relaying scheme and cooperative jamming along with RIS affected by PQEs on the PLS. In detail, the main contributions of this work can be summarized as follows: \u2022 By virtue of the well-adopted Gamma and Exponential\ndistributions as accurate approximations, we provide an approximate expression for the system\u2019s intercept probability (IP) metric in terms of key setup parameters, such as the per RIS number of REs, jamming-to-noise power ratio, legitimate and eavesdropper\u2019s links\u2019 average signalto-noise ratios (SNRs), and the number of quantization bits. \u2022 We derive an asymptotic expression for the IP in the high SNR regime, whereby the underlying coding gain and\ndiversity order are quantified. The results show that the secrecy diversity order is proportional to the minimum of the two RISs\u2019 number of REs. \u2022 We show analytically that the system\u2019s secrecy level improves by increasing the number of REs and/or number of quantization bits. In addition to this, we prove that the SNRs of the legitimate and wiretap links are uncorrelated although they share some common terms. \u2022 We provide extensive numerical and simulation results in order to quantify the secrecy level of the system versus the various parameters involved. We found that an IP around 10\u22124 can be reached with 40 REs per RIS and 10 dB of jamming power-to-noise ratio even when the legitimate links\u2019 average SNRs are 10 dB below the eavesdropper\u2019s one.\nD. Organization\nThe rest of this paper is structured as follows: In Section II, the adopted system model is detailed, while in Section III, we provide some statistics of the different channels\u2019 SNRs. In Section IV, we derive approximate and high-SNR asymptotic expressions for the IP and provide several analytical insights and discussions on the influence of some key system parameters on the system\u2019s security. Numerical and simulation results are presented and discussed in Section V. Finally, Section VI concludes the paper.\nE. Notations\nTable I lists the symbols and notations used in this paper."

The per-hop SNRs (\u03b3SR and \u03b3RD) are approximated by Gamma-distributed RVs with shape parameter\nmUV = K 2\n\u03d52l,1 \u03c02 16\n1 + \u03d5l,2 \u2212 2\u03d52l,1 \u03c02 16\n, UV \u2208 {SR,RD} , (11)\nand scale parameter \u2126UV \u03b3UVmUV with\n\u2126UV = K2\n16\n( \u03c0 sin (X)\nX\n)2 , X \u2208 [ 0, \u03c0\n2\n] , (12)\nwhere X = \u03c0 2 nbl and nbl \u2208 [1,\u221e[. On the other hand, the average value of \u03b3UV is the product of its shape and scale parameters, i.e.,\nE [\u03b3UV ] = \u2126UV \u03b3UV , (13)\nwhich is proportional to \u2126UV . 1) By differentiating \u2126UV with respect to X , one obtains\n\u2202\u2126UV \u2202X = K2\u03c02 sin (X) cos (X) 8X3 (X \u2212 tan (X)) .\n(14) As sin (X) \u2265 0 and cos (X) \u2265 0 for X \u2208 [ 0, \u03c02 ] , the above derivative\u2019s sign depends on the one of g(X) = X \u2212 tan (X). To this end, we have the following\ng\u2032(X) = 1\u2212 sec2 (X) , (15)\nwhere sec (\u00b7) = 1cos(\u00b7) is the secant function, which is obviously greater than or equal to 1 for X \u2208 [ 0, \u03c02 ] . Hence, g\u2032(X) \u2264 0 over this latter interval which yields that (i) g(X) is a decreasing function over the same interval. Furthermore, we have (ii)\nlim x\u21920 g(X) = 0, (16)\nlim x\u2192\u03c02\ng(X) = \u2212\u221e. (17)\n2The channel between the various nodes and the RIS elements can be represented by the Rayleigh fading model, as was considered in various studies such as [15], [16], [35], [36]. Such a model can be used in the considered case of the absence of a line-of-sight link between the nodes and the RIS.\nThus, leveraging (i) and (ii), g(X) \u2264 0 for X \u2208 [ 0, \u03c02 ] . Therefore, \u2126UV is a decreasing function of X . On the other hand, it is obvious that X is inversely proportional to nbl . As a result, \u2126UV is increasing in terms of nbl . Thus, the higher the number of quantization bits, the greater \u2126UV , leading to higher average value of the per-hop legitimate SNR, i.e., E [\u03b3UV ]. 2) We can infer from (12) and (13) that the average legitimate SNRs, i.e., E [\u03b3SR] and E [\u03b3RD], scale with M2 and N2, respectively. Therefore, the higher the number of REs, the greater the legitimate per hop SNRs.\nSince R performs DF relaying protocol, the end-to-end (e2e) SNR can be written as [9, Eq. (13)]\n\u03b3eq = min (\u03b3SR, \u03b3RD) , (18)\nwhere the underlying CCDF is given as\nF (c)\u03b3eq (x) = F (c) \u03b3SR (x)F (c) \u03b3RD (x) . (19)\nIt has been demonstrated in [23], [24] that the random variables (RVs) \u0393RE and \u0393JE , given in the numerator and denominator of (8), respectively, can be approximated by an Exponential distribution with PDF and cumulative distribution function (CDF) expressed as\nf\u0393UE (z) \u2248 1\nN\u03b3UE exp ( \u2212 z N\u03b3UE ) , U \u2208 {R, J} (20)\nand F\u0393UE (z) \u2248 1\u2212 exp ( \u2212 z N\u03b3UE ) , U \u2208 {R, J} , (21)\nrespectively, with an average value of\nE [\u0393UE ] = N\u03b3UE , U \u2208 {R, J} . (22)\nAs a consequence, the CDF of \u03b3RE , defined by (8), can be computed as follows\nF\u03b3RE (z) , \u222b \u221e\n0\nF\u0393RE (z (x+ 1)) f\u0393JE (x) dx (23)\n(a) \u2248 1\nN\u03b3JE \u222b \u221e 0 ( 1\u2212 exp ( \u2212z (x+ 1) N\u03b3RE )) \u00d7 exp\n( \u2212 x N\u03b3JE ) dx, (24)\n(b) = 1\u2212\nexp ( \u2212 zN\u03b3SE ) \u03b3JE \u03b3SE z + 1 . (25)\nBy incorporating (20) with U = J and (21) with U = R into (23), Step (a) is reached, while Step (b) is formed relying on the change of variable t = x + 1 and the integral of the exponential function.\nConsequently, the respective PDF is readily obtained by a differentiation of (25) with respect to z as\nf\u03b3RE (z) \u2248 exp\n( \u2212 zN\u03b3RE ) [\u03b3JEN\u03b3RE + \u03b3RE + \u03b3JEz]\nN (\u03b3RE + \u03b3JEz) 2 .\n(26)\nRemark 2. Leveraging (22), the average value of the eavesdropper link\u2019s SINR (i.e., \u03b3RE), given by (8), can be written as\nE [\u03b3RE ] = E [\u0393RE ]\nE [\u0393JE ] + 1\n= N\u03b3RE\nN\u03b3JE + 1 . (27)\nImportantly, in the absence of jamming (i.e., \u03b3JE = 0), which is among optimal scenarios for the eavesdropper, one obtains E [\u03b3RE ] = N\u03b3RE , which scales with N . On the other hand, when \u03b3RE = \u03b3JE \u2192 \u221e, one obtains E [\u03b3RE ] = 1, which scales independently of N .\nLemma 1 (Independence of the Relay-Destination, Jammer-Eavesdropper, and Relay-Eavesdropper\u2019s Cascaded Fading).

            "text": "In this section, novel approximate and high-SNR-asymptotic expressions for the secrecy IP are derived. The PLS analysis is based on the secrecy capacity metric, which is the maximal achievable transmission rate satisfying a certain equivocation rate at the undesired receiver [37]. Mathematically, it is defined as the difference between the legitimate and illegitimate links\u2019 capacities as follows\nCs = Cl \u2212 Ce, (31)\nwhere Cl = log2 (1 + min (\u03b3SR, \u03b3RD)) , (32)\nand Ce = log2 (1 + \u03b3RE) , (33)\nare the legitimate and eavesdropper\u2019s channels capacities, respectively.\nTo this end, the IP metric represents the probability of the event when the eavesdropper\u2019s channel capacity is above the legitimate\u2019s, which can be written as [38, Eq. (24)]\nPint , Pr [Cs < 0]\n= 1\u2212 Pr [min (\u03b3SR, \u03b3RD) \u2265 \u03b3RE ] . (34)\nRemark 3. The overall secrecy capacity in (31) can be expressed as\nCs = min (CSR, CRD) , (35)\nwhere\nCUV = log2 ( 1 + \u03b3UV 1 + \u03b3RE ) , UV \u2208 {SR,RD} . (36)\n1) As pointed out in Remark 1.1, the average legitimate SNR per hop, i.e., E [\u03b3UV ], is an increasing function of nbl , while the eavesdropper\u2019s average SINR (E [\u03b3RE ]) is independent of it, as shown in Remark 2. Thus, the higher nbl , the greater the SNR per-hop, leading to an improved per-hop (eq. (36)) and e2e (eq. (35)) secrecy capacities. As a consequence, the system\u2019s IP, given by (eq. (34)), decreases, i.e., better system secrecy. 2) Furthermore, E [\u03b3UV ] scales with M2 and N2 for the SR and R-D hops, respectively, as discussed in Remark 1.2, while E [\u03b3RE ] scales with N in an inadequate scenario for the legitimate nodes (i.e., absence of jamming). Therefore, the ratio of E [\u03b3UV ] and E [\u03b3RE ] is expressed as\nE [\u03b3UV ] E [\u03b3RE ]\n= K2\u03b3UV 22nbl sin2\n( \u03c0\n2 nbl ) 16N\u03b3RE , (37)\nwith K = { M, if UV = SR N , if UV = RD . From another front, we have the following function\nh (y) = y2 sin2 ( \u03c0\ny\n) , (38)\nwhere y = 2nbl \u2208 [2,\u221e[, and the derivative of h (y) is\nh\u2032 (y) = 2y sin\n( \u03c0\ny\n)[ sin ( \u03c0\ny ) \u2212 \u03c0 y cos ( \u03c0 y )] . (39)\nObviously, the sign of h\u2032(y) is the one of sin ( \u03c0 y ) \u2212\n\u03c0 y cos ( \u03c0 y ) . Let us solve the inequality\nsin\n( \u03c0\ny ) \u2212 \u03c0 y cos ( \u03c0 y ) > 0\u21d4 tan ( \u03c0 y ) > \u03c0 y , (40)\nwhich holds for y \u2208 [2,\u221e[ as has been shown in Remark 1.1. Thus, h\u2032 (y) \u2265 0 which yields that h (y) increases with y, and consequently with nbl . Henceforth, this yields that 2 2nbl sin2 ( \u03c0 2 nbl ) 16 \u2265 1 4 for nbl \u2265 1. To this end, when \u03b3UV = \u03b3RE , we have the following\nE [\u03b3UV ] E [\u03b3RE ] \u2265 K 2 4N . (41)\nHenceforth, (41) shows that raising the number of REs for K >4 can boost the legitimate-to-wiretap average SNRs ratio. Consequently, the per-hop and e2e secrecy capacities, given by (36) and (35), respectively, increase. As a result, the IP decreases, i.e., enhanced security. 3) It can be obviously noted from (10) and (19) that for M = N and nb1 = nb2 (i.e., mSR = mRD, \u2126SR = \u2126RD), the CCDF of the end-to-end SNR manifests a symmetric behavior with respect to \u03b3SR and \u03b3RD, i.e.,( F (c) \u03b3eq (x) ) \u03b3SR=\u03b1,\u03b3RD=\u03b2 = ( F (c) \u03b3eq (x) ) \u03b3SR=\u03b2,\u03b3RD=\u03b1 ,\nwith \u03b1, \u03b2 > 0. Furthermore, the IP in (34) can be developed as follows\nPint = 1\u2212 Pr [min (\u03b3SR, \u03b3RD) \u2265 \u03b3RE ] = 1\u2212 \u222b \u221e\n0\nF (c)\u03b3eq (x) f\u03b3RE (x) dx, (42)\nwhich exhibits as well a symmetric behavior with respect to \u03b3SR and \u03b3RD.\nA. Exact Analysis\nProposition 1. The IP of the considered dual-hop RISaided WCS can be written in terms of the approximate form given by (43) at the top of the next page, where Hm1,n1;m2,n2;m3,n3p1,q1;p2,p2;p3,q3 (\u00b7, \u00b7 |\u00b7 ) is the bivariate Fox\u2019s H-function [39, Eq.

At the high SNR regime (\u03b3SR = \u03b3RD = \u03b3 \u2192 \u221e), the IP of the considered dual-hop RIS-assisted WCS can be asymptotically expanded as\nP (\u221e) int \u223c Gc\u03b3 \u2212Gd , (46)\nwhere Gc is defined in (47) shown at the top of the next page, while\nGd = min (mSR,mRD) . (48)\nProof: The proof is provided in Appendix C.\nRemark 4. Leveraging (11), it can be noted that the secrecy diversity order, given by (48), is directly proportional to the minimum among the number of REs of L(1) and L(2)."

Furthermore, the IP exhibits a remarkable decrease vs. \u03b3 as expected. Finally, one can ascertain that the higher the jamming powerto-noise ratio, the better the secrecy is, where an IP of 10\u22126 can be reached with \u03b3JE = 20 dB, though the legitimate average SNRs are below the eavesdropper\u2019s one.\nIn Fig. 3, the IP is plotted vs \u03b3 for various values of REs\u2019 number (M,N). Obviously, the system\u2019s secrecy improves by increasing the number of REs, as pointed out in Remarks 1.2 and 3.2, where one can attain an IP of 10\u22124 with 40 REs for \u03b3JE = 10 dB even when the eavesdropper\u2019s link SNR exceeds the legitimate\u2019s ones by almost 10 dB (i.e., \u03b3 = 30 dB, \u03b3RE = 40 dB). Also, the IP drops to 10 \u22126\nwith M,N \u2265 28 while \u03b3 < \u03b3RE . Besides, it is noted that the high-SNR asymptotic dashed curves, plotted from (46), match tightly the approximate\u2019s solid-line curves at high SNR values, corroborating the accuracy of the asymptotic analysis.\nThe influence of the number of quantization bits (i.e., nb1 , nb2 ) is shown in Fig. 4, where the IP is plotted with respect to \u03b3 for various nb1 and nb2 values for \u03b3JE = 0 dB. One can ascertain that a very low phase resolution, i.e., nb1 = nb2 = 1 bit, yields a remarkable IP degradation. Furthermore, the increase in nbl (l = 1, 2) to 2 bits produces a 5-dB secrecy gain at the high SNR, which endorses the insights discussed in Remarks 1.1 and 3.1. Importantly, we ascertain that the secrecy of the system is not improved further when nbl exceeds 3 bits.\nThe IP is shown in Fig. 5 in three dimensions as a function of both legitimate average SNRs (\u03b3SR and \u03b3RD), where \u03b3RE = 30 dB and M = N = 24. As manifested in the previous figures, the IP decreases when both SNRs increase. Additionally, the IP exhibits a symmetric behavior for both average SNRs, as discussed in Remark 3.3. Furthermore, it is worth noting that when \u03b3SR (\u03b3RD) is fixed, the IP reveals horizontal floors at high \u03b3RD (\u03b3SR). In fact, the e2e SNR \u03b3eq , given by (18), equals the minimum among \u03b3SR and \u03b3RD. To this end, the IP reaches the saturation regime at high \u03b3SR (\u03b3RD) values when \u03b3RD (\u03b3SR) is fixed.\nFig. 6 presents the IP behavior versus \u03b3RE and \u03b3JE , where \u03b3SR = \u03b3RD = 0, 10 dB. Expectedly, the system\u2019s security level deteriorates when \u03b3RE increases, i.e., 100% IP is manifested for \u03b3SR = \u03b3RD = 0 dB, \u03b3JE \u2264 0 dB and \u03b3RE \u2265 40 dB. Importantly, jamming can effectively improve the security where the IP can be maintained around 10\u22122 and 1.3 \u00d7 10\u22123, for \u03b3JE = 34 dB, even when the SNR of the illegitimate channel is 41 and 32 dB-advantageous over the legitimate links\u2019, respectively.\nThe system\u2019s secrecy diversity order is illustrated in Fig. 7 in terms of the number of REs (M,N) and nbl . As discussed in Remark 4, the system\u2019s diversity order increases with the increase in the number of REs. That is, the higher the number of REs, the greater the IP slope at high SNR as can be noted as well from the asymptotic curves in Fig. 3. Also, the diversity order is less impacted by nbl above 2 bits.\nIn Fig. 8, a comparative IP analysis is provided between the considered system and two distinct setups of single-RIS dualhop WCSs, namely: when the RIS is incorporated only in the first hop (Setup I) or the second hop (Setup II). It is worthy to mention that the results for Setups I and II were obtained by virtue of Monte Carlo simulations. Also, we set M = N . The results show that the analyzed system clearly outperforms the aforementioned schemes in terms of PLS. Furthermore, we observe that Setup I, i.e., RIS incorporated only in the first hop, exhibits a slight secrecy improvement compared to Setup II, i.e., RIS in the second hop, where the eavesdropper and legitimate destination in the latter case benefit from the SNR improvement through involving the RIS in the second\nhop. Furthermore, it is obvious that the analyzed system\u2019s IP manifests a decreasing behavior vs (M,N), different from Setups I and II, where the IP is constant with respect to the number of REs. This is due to the saturation effect of the DF relaying\u2019s e2e SNR, given by (18), where \u03b3eq equals \u03b3RD regardless of boosting \u03b3SR by increasing the number of REs (Setup I) or vice-versa (Setup II)."

            "text": "In this paper, we provide a thorough analysis of the secrecy performance of a dual-hop RIS-assisted and jamming-aided WCS. The setup consists of a source transmitting information signals to a destination through a DF relay. Two RISs assist the source-relay and relay-destination communications. We assume the presence of an eavesdropper that attempts to overhear the signal forwarded by the relay and reflected by the second RIS. We also introduce a friendly jammer to increase the security level by means of a broadcasted jamming signal. Finally, we assume that RISs phase shifts are subject to PQEs.\nTight approximate and asymptotic IP expressions were derived, where the impact of key system parameters was discussed. Our results showed that the system\u2019s IP is significantly improved by increasing the jamming power and number of REs, where the IP can reach 10\u22126 with 40 REs and 10 dB of jamming power-to-noise ratio, even when the legitimate average SNRs are below the wiretap one. Furthermore, we showed that there is no impact on the secrecy of the system when the number of quantization bits exceeds 3 bits. Importantly, the results also illustrate the efficiency of jamming in maintaining lower IP levels in strong eavesdropping scenarios (i.e., the eavesdropper\u2019s SNR is much higher compared to the legitimate one) with a fixed number of REs. We showed as well that the secrecy diversity order is proportional to the minimum among both RISs\u2019 number of REs. Lastly, the analyzed system shows remarkable secrecy improvement compared to the single-RIS dual-hop networks, i.e., RIS involved in one of the two hops."

Therefore, gRE and gJE are uncorrelated.

Thus, as E [hAB ] = 0, both correlation coefficients vanish, resulting in the mutual independence of gRD, gRE , and gJE . This concludes the proof of Lemma 1."
