            "text": "Nitrogenase (N2ase) is a microbial enzyme responsible for converting inert atmospheric dinitrogen (N2) to bioavailable ammonia (NH3) under ambient conditions.1,2 The industrial analogue of this reaction is the Haber\u2013Bosch (HB) process, which is energy-intensive and environmentally taxing due to the high pressures (>100 bar) and temperatures (\u223c500 \u00b0C) used during catalysis, and the signicant quantities of CO2 produced as a by-product of industrial H2 production.3,4 The ambient, H2-free nature of N2ase-catalyzed nitrogen xation has made these enzymes particularly alluring in the search for alternative routes to NH3 production, both for fertilizer production and as an H2 carrier. Furthermore, N2ases can catalytically reduce several triple bond-containing substrates, including HCN, C2H2, N3 \u2212, and even inert CO.5\u20137\nThree types of nitrogenases have been reported, each named for the homocitratebinding metal contained in the catalytic cofactor, i.e., Mo, V, and Fe N2ase. Each of these three nitrogenases is a two-component system, comprised of a reducing Feprotein, and the catalytic cofactor-containing MFe protein (M = Mo, V, Fe), again denoted by the contained homocitrate-binding metal (Fig. 1).8,9,12,13 Similarly, the catalytic clusters of MoFe, VFe, and FeFe are referred to as FeMoco ([Mo-7Fe-9S-Chomocitrate]), FeVco ([V-7Fe-8S-C-(CO3)-homocitrate]), and FeFeco (putative composition: [8Fe-9S-C-homocitrate]), respectively.

The displayed FeFe model was generated using AlphaFold and the protein sequence of FeFe.10,11\n254 | Faraday Discuss., 2023, 243, 253\u2013269 This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023\npe n\nA cc\nes s\nA rt\nic le\n.

Recently, Hoffman and coworkers have extensively employed ENDOR spectroscopy across multiple redox states and intermediates of Mo N2ase to establish that the carbide atom serves to maintain the structural rigidity of the cofactor (acting as a \u201cheart of steel\u201d).31 Seven different protein samples were investigated, including both resting and reactive intermediate states, and the 13C isotopic hyperne coupling constants were found to range from \u22121.3 to +2.7 MHz, indicating negligible changes to the carbide structure for Mo N2ase during turnover. Meanwhile, FeVco was long believed to be a direct analog of FeMoco, with V replacing Mo at the apical position of the cluster, however, crystal structures of the VFe protein have unexpectedly and consistently revealed that one of three belt sulfurs of FeVco is replaced by a carbonate ligand.9,22\u201324 We note however, that spectroscopic support for the presence of the carbonate bridge remains elusive.28 Meanwhile, the crystal structure of the FeFe protein has yet to be reported in the literature.\nDespite signicant progress in the active site structure characterization of N2ases, particularly through protein crystallography, extensive X-ray spectroscopy, and pulsed EPR methods, a comparative study of all three N2ases using an Fe-specic spectroscopic tool to examine the structural differences of the three unique catalytic cofactors has yet to be reported. All three unique catalytic cofactors of the N2ases share Fe as the primary metal component; therefore, Fespecic techniques, such as 57Fe nuclear resonance vibrational spectroscopy (NRVS),32\u201335 can serve as common probes of the active sites of all three N2ases, allowing their molecular and electronic structures to be compared. Herein, we report the NRVS characterization of MoFe together with the \u201calternative nitrogenases\u201d (V-, Fe-dependent N2ases). For each of the three nitrogenases, we present both the apo (FeMco-decient, M = Mo, V, Fe) and holo proteins. In this way, we determine the primary spectral regions where the FeMco-clusters and Pclusters contribute to the partial vibrational density of states (PVDOS), and further correlate these results with electronic structure investigations at the QM/MM level. The sensitivity of the calculated PVDOS to the computational model parameters are discussed, and the implications of these ndings for structural modelling based on NRVS data are highlighted."

The soluble fraction was loaded on a 10 mL gravity-ow Strep-tactin column previously equilibrated in buffer [Tris 20 mM pH 7.4, NaCl 200 mM]. The column was then washed with the same buffer until the ow-through did not contain any protein, and the protein was eluted with 30 mL of that buffer supplemented with 3 mM desthiobiotin. The elution fraction was concentrated using a 100 kDa MWCO centrifugal lter unit until a concentration of 80 mg mL\u22121. 5 mM Na dithionite was added to each sample before loading in NRVS sample cells. For measurements at SPring-8 BL19LXU, the sample cells consisted of a 16.6 \u00d7 3.6 \u00d7 2.4 mm (l \u00d7 w \u00d7 h) block Delrin\u00ae with a 10 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 1.2 mm (l \u00d7 w \u00d7 h) well machined into the face. For measurements at ESRF ID18, sample cells consisted of a Cu block with a machined 12 \u00d7 2.5 \u00d7 1.5 mm trough, which was coated with a thin polystyrene lm to prevent direct contact of the sample with metallic Cu. The open faces of the well/trough of either sample cell were sealed with 1-mil (25 mM) polyimide tape prior to sample loading, which was performed using a Hamilton\u00ae syringe and stainless-steel needle.\nNRVS data collection & analysis 57Fe NRVS spectra of holo-VFe, apo-VFe, holo-FeFe and apo-FeFe proteins were measured at SPring-8 BL19LXU, while measurements of holo-MoFe and apoMoFe proteins were performed at ESRF ID18. Detailed descriptions of the experimental setups used at either beamline are provided in the ESI.\u2020 NRVS data analysis includes aligning, summing, and normalizing scans, deconvoluting the monochromator line shape function, subtracting the intensity from the elastic nuclear resonance, estimation of sample temperature by detailed balance tting, removal of multi-phonon contributions, and conversion to the PVDOS. For spectra obtained at SPring-8 BL19LXU, these steps were performed using the padd and phox subroutines of the program PHOENIX v. 2.1.4.38,39 For spectra obtained at ESRF ID18, these steps were performed using the soware package DOS40 updated with the graphical user interface nisGUI v. 1.2. Additionally, energy calibration was performed in MATLAB based on measurements of [Et4N]\n57FeCl4 based on the reported T2 bending mode at 138 cm\n\u22121 and asymmetric T2 stretching modes at 376 and 389 cm\u22121.41\nThe derived FeMoco PVDOS was calculated using the normalized probability densities of the nuclear inelastic absorption spectra acquired for apo- and holoMoFe. Specically, the spectrum of apo-MoFe was scaled by 8/15ths (corresponding to 8 Fe of the P-cluster contributing to the 15 Fe contained in holoMoFe) and numerically subtracted from the spectrum of holo-MoFe. The resulting difference spectrum was then processed using the phox subroutine of the program PHOENIX v. 2.1.4 to produce the PVDOS.38,39"

All QM/MM calculations were performed with Chemshell44,45 with an interface to ORCA46,47 version 4.2.1 (QM program) and DL_POLY48 (MM program). MM calculations used the CHARMM36 (ref. 49) forceeld. All QM calculations employed the TPSSh density functional,50,51 with D3BJ dispersion correction52,53 and with the ZORA scalar relativistic approximation.54,55 The relativistically recontracted ZORA-def2 basis set family was used (ZORA-def2TZVP on Mo, V, Fe, S and carbide and ZORA-def2-SVP on other atoms).56,57 The RIJCOSX approximation58,59 for Coulomb and HF exchange integrals was used with a decontracted auxiliary basis set.60 The QM/MM coupling was described using electrostatic embedding together with link atoms and a charge-shiing scheme.44 QM/MM geometry optimizations used the DL-FIND program.61 QM-regions of varying sizes were tested for FeMoco as well as different sized partial Hessians. In the case of [Fe4S4(SPh)4]\n2\u2212 and for QM-cluster calculations of FeMco, CPCM62 was used as a continuum solvation model, with 3 = 4 for FeMco (simulating a protein environment) and 3 = N for [Fe4S4(SPh)4]\n2\u2212 (simulating a polar crystal). The ZORATPSSh electronic structure level of theory has previously been shown to wellreproduce the geometries (M\u2013Fe distances and M\u2013S bond lengths) of spin-coupled iron\u2013sulfur dimers and the high-resolution X-ray crystal structure of FeMoco.63,64 Vibrational frequencies were calculated using a numerical one-point formula partial Hessian approach (of varying size) for QM/MM and numerical two-point formula QM-cluster calculations; a comparison of numerical one-point vs. two-point partial Hessian approaches for FeMoco is provided in Fig. S1.\u2020 57Fe normal mode composition factors were calculated and used to derive 57Fe PVDOS. Each calculated vibrational transition was broadened by a 12 cm\u22121 Gaussian (FWHM).\nBroken-symmetry states for the FeMco clusters, Mo N2ase P-cluster and [Fe4S4(SPh)4]\n2\u2212 were found using a high-spin ferromagnetic initial state. The geometry for each BS state was optimized and the Hessian calculated. For FeMoco and FeVco, 3 different determinants of the favorable BS7 class were found as previously described:42,43,65,66 BS7-235, BS7-346 and BS7-247 where the last 3 numbers refer to which Fe ions (X-ray structure numbering, Fig. S2\u2020)67 are spin-down. A total charge of n = \u22121 was used when treating the total valency of FeMoco. As recent studies have suggested, extractions of VFe are comprised of a mixture of both EPR-active/ catalytically inactive and EPR-silent/catalytically active components,21 FeVco cluster charges ([V-7Fe-8S-C-CO3]\nn) with n = \u22122 and \u22121 were calculated in spin states ofMS = 3/2 andMS = 1, respectively, with a BS7-235 determinant, previously shown to be lowest in energy for FeVco.43 For FeFeco, no X-ray structure has been reported in the literature and the redox state is not well established. Models using a [8Fe-9S-C]n form with n = \u22122, \u22121, 0 withMS = 0, 1/2, and 1 spin states with a BS0235 broken-symmetry determinant were calculated (where the 4 numbers refer to which Fe ions are spin-down, X-ray structure numbering as shown in Fig. S2\u2020). For the P-cluster, an MS = 0 BS-1247 determinant was employed."

These vibrational frequencies match well with the previously reported PVDOS of Mo N2ase \u2013 a comparison is provided in Fig. S3.\u202032,33 Similarly, the PVDOS of apoMoFe (P-cluster only) also compares well with that previously reported, exhibiting relatively broad features \u223c155, 255, 323, and 363 cm\u22121. The broadness of these features likely arises from the relatively low symmetry of the P-cluster, leading to distributions of concerted bending and stretching modes. By subtracting the apo-MoFe spectrum from the holo-MoFe spectrum, a FeMoco-only spectrum can be obtained (PVDOS shown as orange dashed line, Fig. 2A) which has several clear ngerprints and allows the differences between the apo and holo protein to be more clearly highlighted. Well-resolved features appear on top of the broad bands arising from apo-MoFe, specically \u223c140 and 270 cm\u22121, while features at 190 and 422 cm\u22121 appear as completely unique ngerprints to FeMoco. Additionally, a signicant increase in intensity is observed for a series of features at \u223c320 and 390 cm\u22121. Previous NRVS studies of [Fe4S4(SPh)4]2\u2212 support assignment of the feature at \u223c140 cm\u22121 as a S\u2013Fe\u2013S bending vibration, while those at 267 and 290 cm\u22121 likely arise from a series of Fe\u2013S stretching modes (Fig. S4\u2020).68 Previously, the band appearing at \u223c190 cm\u22121 was assigned as a symmetric Fe6C stretch referred to as a \u201cbreathing\u201d mode of the FeMoco cluster.32 Meanwhile, the feature at 422 cm\u22121 has not been explicitly assigned."

Comparing holo- and apo-VFe, we see that the energetic ranges from 170\u2013200 cm\u22121 and \u223c250 cm\u22121 appear to be unique to the holo protein.\nIn holo-FeFe, signicant features appear around 143, 171, 187, 258, 304, and 365 cm\u22121, while the apo-FeFe PVDOS exhibits a distinct feature at 147 cm\u22121, along with very broad bands in the 200\u2013340 range, and several distinct peaks at 354 and 383 cm\u22121. Like apo-MoFe and apo-VFe, the appearance of a signicant band \u223c150 cm\u22121 makes this a distinct feature common to the P-clusters of all three N2ases. However, unlike apo-MoFe and apo-VFe, signicant intensity is still observed in the 200\u2013250 cm\u22121 region of apo-FeFe, making the PVDOS of this protein particularly distinct from both apo-MoFe and apo-FeFe.\nComparing the PVDOS of MoFe, VFe, and FeFe together, several commonalities and differences become readily apparent. All three holo-proteins exhibit increased intensity in the 170\u2013210 cm\u22121 region relative to their apo-forms, supporting that this region provides a strong, common ngerprint for all three FeMcofactors. However, the bulk of intensity for this region is shied to lower energy in holo-VFe relative to either holo-MoFe or FeFe. One notable difference between holo-MoFe and either VFe or FeFe is a distinct lack of the high-energy feature \u223c422 cm\u22121 in the latter, implying a structural shi between MoFe and either VFe or FeFe.\nBased on the reported high-resolution crystal structures of MoFe8 and VFe,9 we anticipated the P-clusters of apo-MoFe and apo-VFe (and by extension, apo-FeFe) to appear near-identical. However, we observe major discrepancies between the three apo-N2ase PVDOS. While these differences may arise from the unique protein environment-induced modulation of the P-cluster in each enzyme, we caution that the risk of sample heterogeneity due to the one-step affinity purication technique used for sample preparation cannot be ruled out. This technique is commonly employed and allows for fast sample preparation; however, it acts as a double-edged sword. Rapid purication signicantly reduces the risk of protein denaturation and metallocluster damage, while simultaneously carrying the risk that a distribution of nitrogenase complexes in different maturation states may be present in the puried product. In MoFe isolated from wild-type A. vinelandii cells via one-step affinity purication, both the P-cluster and FeMoco are fully matured;69,70 however, it is not yet established if this is the case for VFe and FeFe puried when the same technique is applied, and specically to how these compositions may vary between strains producing apo- vs. holo-VFe and FeFe. Moreover, the properties of the P-cluster in VFe and FeFe are not yet fully understood; notably, our EPR measurements of holo- and apo-VFe display a signicant S= 1/2 signal, which may be tentatively attributed to either damaged P-cluster, a maturation intermediate, or even both (Fig. S5\u2020).21,71 A similar signal has also been observed in the EPR spectrum of FeFe, as well as in the present study.26 A detailed investigation is currently underway in our lab to further\nThis journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023 Faraday Discuss., 2023, 243, 253\u2013269 | 259\npe n\nA cc\nes s\nA rt\nic le\n.

Nevertheless, amid these cautions, we emphasize that there are general differences between all apo and holo proteins which allow us to clearly assign spectral regions that are dominated by FeMco cluster contributions."

The harmonic vibrational energies come directly from the normal mode analysis as do the intensities (57Fe normal mode composition factors). A previous NRVS experiment on a [4Fe-4S] cubane cluster with (SPh) ligation ([Fe4S4(SPh)4]\n2\u2212) was found to serve a useful purpose for calibration.68 More specically, it shares some of the same basic structural features as the FeMco clusters, having weak-eld tetrahedral Fe sites in FeII/FeIII oxidation states with a mixed-valence delocalized electronic structure and containing both inorganic m3-suldes and thiolates, while lacking a carbide and m2suldes. The experimental PVDOS shown in Fig. 3 reveals NRVS intensity in most parts of the spectrum across the 0\u2013400 cm\u22121 region, though notably lacking signicant intensity at \u223c190 cm\u22121.\nAs Fig. 3 also reveals, the calculated PVDOS of [Fe4S4(SPh)4] 2\u2212 (modeled as a simple dianionic cluster surrounded by a polarizable continuum) can reproduce the main peaks in the experimental PVDOS well, demonstrating the applicability of the electronic structure approach (ZORA-TPSSh). No signs of systematic overestimation are indicated, and thus no empirical scaling factor has been introduced.

The 200\u2013300 cm\u22121 region consists of various types of bending modes with some Fe\u2013S stretching character while the 90\u2013150 cm\u22121 region primarily contains bending modes with much less Fe\u2013S stretching character. The ESI\u2020 contains animations of vibrational modes with substantial iron contributions.\nThe apo-MoFe PVDOS should consist solely of the contribution of the Pcluster. The P-cluster, an [8Fe-7S] cluster, can be envisioned as a fusion of 2 [4Fe-4S] cubanes at a corner through an interstitial sulphide. While there are clear similarities between the [4Fe-4S] cubane PVDOS in Fig. 3 and the P-cluster PVDOS presented in Fig. 4A (intensity at \u223c140, \u223c270 and 380 cm\u22121), the P-cluster also gives rise to a broader spectral envelope, as would be expected from the more complex molecular structure, featuring both terminal and bridging thiolates, m3suldes in distorted cubanes and an unusual m6-sulde. Visualization of the calculated vibrational modes reveal considerable complexity. Briey, the 300\u2013 400 cm\u22121 region contains Fe\u2013S stretching modes involving m3-suldes (346\u2013 426 cm\u22121) and thiolates (309\u2013345 cm\u22121). Stretching modes involving the m6sulde appear at 275\u2013293 cm\u22121. Most of the individual stretching modes are localized to each sub-cubane of the P-cluster, however, some are delocalized over the whole cluster. The region of 120\u2013270 cm\u22121 consists primarily of various bending modes (higher energy ones having some stretching thiolate character) that are delocalized over the whole cluster. Despite the additional complexity that arises in the P-cluster and the complex coupled nature of most of the modes (see ESI\u2020 for animations), the QM/MM calculation of MoFe protein with the P-cluster in the QM-region is reassuringly able to reproduce the main PVDOS features of the spectrum quite well.\nThe FeMoco cluster of nitrogenase can also be approximately described as a fusion of two cubanes (e.g. [4Fe-4S] and [Mo-3Fe-4S]) but, importantly, contains an interstitial carbide that makes this cluster structurally distinct. The sensitivity\nFig. 4 (A) Calculated P-cluster PVDOS from the MoFe QM/MMmodel, BS-1247, (red line) compared to the experimental apo-MoFe PVDOS (black).

Overall, the use of QM/MM, rather than cluster model, is found to be critical (Fig. S6 of the ESI\u2020) and while there is some sensitivity with respect to QM-region and size of partial Hessian, a small QM-region and Hessian region reproduces the main features of the largest calculation well (Fig. S7\u2020). Furthermore, observed spectral improvements (compared to experiment) appear to arise more-so from a systematic improvement in geometry accuracy rather than the increased size of the partial Hessian.\nOverall, the experimental PVDOS is well reproduced by QM/MM calculations (Fig. 4B), with the primary deviations being a lack of calculated intensity in the 360\u2013370 cm\u22121 region (likely due to an overestimation of the calculated modes 380\u2013440 cm\u22121 by 10\u201320 cm\u22121) and the appearance of an additional peak in the 200\u2013210 cm\u22121 region. As mentioned earlier, the 170\u2013210 cm\u22121 region appears particularly unique to FeMoco. Previous analysis of calculated PVDOS by Cramer and co-workers have described this region as arising from an Fe6X (X = C, N, O) \u201cbreathing\u201d mode,32 where the relatively high energy (190 cm\u22121 vs. 150 cm\u22121 as seen in other cubanes68) arises from the additional cluster rigidity conferred by the central atom. Our present analysis reveals an important reason why this region of the MoFe PVDOS is FeMoco-specic: the modes involve Fe\u2013carbide stretching character. More precisely, the modes in this region involve a pair of Fe ions in each sub-cubane (Fe2\u2013Fe6, Fe3\u2013Fe7 and Fe4\u2013Fe5) and can be described as a combination of anti-symmetric Fe\u2013carbide stretching modes and bridging belt sulphide wagging, both being structural properties unique to the FeMoco cluster in MoFe. Calculated modes are available for visualization in the ESI.\u2020\nCloser inspection of the additional calculated peak in the 200\u2013210 cm\u22121 region reveals that it maintains very similar character to those modes at 170\u2013200 cm\u22121, with each having dominant Fe\u2013carbide stretching character involving a pair of belt Fe ions. The reason for the higher-energy shi of the modes to 200\u2013210 cm\u22121 arises from the additional involvement of the Fe4\u2013Fe5 pair. In the specic brokensymmetry solution calculated, BS7-235, Fe4\u2013Fe5 is best described as a pair of ferric Fe ions (with the other Fe ions being mixed-valence delocalized), as previously described.42 The difference in Fe oxidation state in the BS-state calculated thus offers an explanation for the appearance of the higher energy peak in the calculated PVDOS. There are two plausible explanations for why this occurs in our calculations: (i) our choice of density functional (TPSSh) overestimates the effective Fe oxidation state differences (i.e., the covalency is not captured well enough) and/or (ii) the broken-symmetry approach lacks the exibility to fully describe the electronic structure.\nRegarding density functional choice, we note that our electronic structure protocol has been previously shown to reproduce the high-resolution X-ray structure of FeMoco and related spin-coupled dimers very well,42,63 likely due to a balanced treatment of covalency in the Fe\u2013S bonds. However, less is known about the quality of the electronic structure description regarding the Fe\u2013carbide bonds, and any over/under estimation of Fe\u2013C covalency may well lead to the observed deviations in the 170\u2013200 cm\u22121 region.\nAnother plausible explanation arises from the implementation of spinsymmetry broken DFT. In particular, we nd that a single determinant (BS7-\n262 | Faraday Discuss., 2023, 243, 253\u2013269 This journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023\npe n\nA cc\nes s\nA rt\nic le\n.

T hi s ar tic le is li ce ns ed u nd er a C re at iv e C om m on s A ttr ib ut io n 3. 0 U np or te d L\nic en\nce .\n235) leads to this additional calculated peak. There are 3 BS7 determinants (BS7235, BS7-346 and BS7-247) that are effectively energetically equivalent at the TPSSh-level of theory (\u223c1 kcal mol\u22121 energy difference). These 3 determinants give rise to distinct geometric FeMoco structures which can be interpreted as 3 distinct electronic states, with BS7-235 providing the best agreement with the high-resolution X-ray structure. Alternatively, the true wavefunction of FeMoco could be conceived as a combination of these 3 determinants. As shown in Fig. S8,\u2020 calculating the PVDOS for each BS determinant leads to non-negligible changes (a direct result of the distinct geometries), including in the 190\u2013210 cm\u22121 region. It is possible that the failure of our electronic structure protocol to fully describe this spectral region could be a result of the limitation of the BS-DFT approach, perhaps necessitating a weighted average of calculated PVDOS over all 3 determinants. These results thus serve as inspiration for improving the electronic structure description of FeMoco, which is currently limited to brokensymmetry DFT.\nFinally, we turn to a comparison of the QM/MM calculated PVDOS for FeMoco, FeVco and FeFeco; as a crystallographic structure of FeFeco has not yet been reported, the protein environment of MoFe was employed in the case of the FeFe protein. For FeVco, both the [V-7Fe-8S-C-CO3] 2\u2212 and [V-7Fe-8S-C-CO3] \u2212 redox states were calculated. Previous QM/MM calculations have shown that the [V-7Fe8S-C-CO3]\n2\u2212 redox state (MS = 3/2) provides the best calculated structural agreement with the VFe protein X-ray structure43 (which may not be the resting state) while remaining consistent with the S = 3/2 EPR signal previously attributed to the VFe resting state. However, recent EPR studies have suggested that the resting state of active FeVco is actually EPR-silent, wherein the S = 1/2 EPR signal originates from the P-cluster or P-cluster maturation intermediates, while the two S = 3/2 signals are associated with inactive forms of FeVco.21 The redox state of FeFeco is also not condently known, and a valency of [8Fe-9S-C]2\u2212 has been presently employed, as shown in Fig. 5; the calculated PVDOS for alternative redox state possibilities ([8Fe-9S-C]\u2212 and [8Fe-9S-C]0) are provided in the ESI (Fig. S9\u2020).\nSimilar to our experimental observations, comparisons of QM/MM Hessian calculations of FeMoco, FeVco, and FeFeco reveal that structural differences of the cofactors translate into considerably different PVDOS. However, there is a closer correspondence between the PVDOS of FeMoco and FeFeco, with FeVco clearly being the most different of the three (regardless of redox state calculated). In particular, the region ranging from 170\u2013210 cm\u22121 differs considerably for FeVco, likely due to the substitution of a belt sulphide for carbonate in FeVco, which would be expected to shi the energy of the modes in this region. There is also a sensitivity to which FeVco redox state is calculated; however, it remains unclear which spectrum is in better agreement with experiment. In the observed experimental PVDOS of VFe, the dominant intensity of this region is red-shied to \u223c170 cm\u22121 (as compared to \u223c190 cm\u22121 in MoFe and FeFe). The observed variations within the 170\u2013210 cm\u22121 region, combined with the (a) crystallographically demonstrated differences in belt atom identity and (b) high similarity of the PVDOS of FeFe and MoFe in this region supports the presence of three beltsulphurs in the resting state of FeFeco.\nThe highest energy experimental feature at 422 cm\u22121 in the PVDOS of FeMoco presented in Fig. 4B is well reproduced by our QM/MM calculations (\u223c440 cm\u22121), and is plausibly assigned to an Fe\u2013S stretching mode involving the belt sulphide\nThis journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023 Faraday Discuss., 2023, 243, 253\u2013269 | 263\nFig. 5 Overlay of calculated PVDOS of all three nitrogenase FeM-cofactors according to QM/MM calculations.

The analogous modes of belt sulphides S5A and S3A are calculated to be lower in energy (350\u2013400 cm\u22121). The origin of the high-energy of this specic Fe\u2013S belt sulphide stretching mode is likely related to the environment around S2B in MoFe, with a directional hydrogen bond donated from His195. As shown in Fig. S6,\u2020 the CPCM-cluster model (lacking an explicit protein environment) does not produce this high-energy feature. The lack of this highenergy feature in the experimental VFe and FeFe PVDOS, however, is more likely related to different resting redox states of the cofactor, which can shi the energy of the feature as shown in Fig. 5. Among the FeVco redox states calculated, the [V-7Fe-8S-C-CO3]\n2\u2212 calculation is found to be more consistent with experiment (i.e., lacking a high-energy feature relative to FeMoco) than the [V-7Fe-8S-CCO3]\n\u2212 calculation. As shown in Fig. S9,\u2020 the [8Fe-9S-C]2\u2212 redox state appears to be in better agreement with experiment than either [8Fe-9S-C]\u2212 or [8Fe-9S-C]0."

The three holo protein PVDOS show subtle variations in this spectral region, with MoFe and FeFe being more similar to each other than VFe. In addition, holo MoFe shows a unique feature at 422 cm\u22121, which is absent in the other two holo proteins.\nUsing DFT-based QM/MM calculations, we were able to obtain further insight into the origins of these spectral features. Our calculations have shown that both a simple 4Fe-4S model complex, as well as the P-cluster NRVS data can be well modelled using our BS-DFT based approach. Both the experimental data and calculations show the evolution of spectral complexity moving from a 4Fe-4S cubane to the P-cluster, and nally to the FeMco clusters. While the 4Fe-4S cluster and the P-clusters of MoFe protein are generally well reproduced by our calculations, modelling the FeMco clusters in terms of both valency and spin state shows greater variability. Specically, for FeMoco, we have observed that the calculated PVDOS are very sensitive to the computational modelling protocol employed. It is clear that a QM/MM model, rather than a cluster model, is required to accurately capture primary spectral features. For instance, the clear band observed experimentally at \u223c420 cm\u22121 is only reproduced computationally in the QM/MM model, demonstrating the importance of properly modelling the protein environment. We note that this feature is unique to FeMoco, and can be attributed to an Fe\u2013S2B stretching mode. The identication of this feature is of great interest as the S2B position is thought to be potentially labile during catalysis.19,24,72\u201374 This assignment hence provides a spectroscopic signature for identifying its contributions, which may be of great utility in future studies of MoFe intermediates.\nOur calculations have proven to be less sensitive to the size of the QM region, indicating that relatively small QM regions may represent a reasonable convergence of the Hessian. However, these calculations are also sensitive to the specic (almost isoenergetic) broken symmetry determinant used in the electronic structure calculations of FeMoco, particularly in the 170\u2013210 cm\u22121 region. Presently, this dependence is not completely understood but may indicate that averaging over multiple broken symmetry determinants is necessary to fully capture the distinct experimental peak patterns of this region. The present ndings thus further demonstrate the need to develop computational approaches that go beyond BS-DFT. Here, recent developments in wave function-based ab initio approaches to iron\u2013sulphur clusters and to nitrogenase clusters are of great interest.75\u201377\nThe issues discussed here become even more complex for FeVco, where the ground state electronic structure remains a subject of debate.21 For FeFeco, the complexity is even further increased due to our present lack of understanding regarding the ground state electronic structure and the fact that a crystal structure is not currently available in the literature. In spite of these limitations, we are able to qualitatively capture the trends observed in our experimental data. We note, however, that these results highlight that caution must be exercised in using calculated PVDOS to quantitatively evaluate changes in the experimental PVDOS. In particular, using the discrete frequency of an observed feature to assign a given geometric/electronic structure state may be treacherous.\nFinally, in closing, we note that these ndings also have broad implications for the use of DFT cluster models to simulate the NRVS for many other metalloprotein\nThis journal is \u00a9 The Royal Society of Chemistry 2023 Faraday Discuss., 2023, 243, 253\u2013269 | 265\npe n\nA cc\nes s\nA rt\nic le\n.

Specically, the observations herein indicate that the failure to properly model the H-bonding from the protein environment may result not only in spectral shis, but potentially even in the absence of certain spectral features. This provides an important cautionary note for the application of overly simplistic cluster models to calculate metalloprotein PVDOS \u2013 particularly in cases where open geometric and electronic structure questions may complicate the modelling."
