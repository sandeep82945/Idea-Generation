    "abstractText": "Depression is one of the mental illnesses that negatively affect a person's thinking, action, and feeling. Thus the rate of depression is identified by analyzing Electroencephalogram (EEG) signals, but it has the problem of classifying depression rate because of noise. In this paper, a novel Bat-based UNET Signal Analysis (BUSA) framework is designed to organize the depression rate of patients with an EEG dataset. This technique involves preprocessing, feature selection, feature extraction, and classification. After the data training process preprocessing function was activated to remove the noise in the brain signal. Hereafter, the noiseless signal is used for the further process. Here, the fitness of the bat is upgraded in the UNET classification layer. Moreover, the brain signal's feature selection and depression rate were classified using the bat fitness that has helped to gain the desired output. Finally, performance metrics of the proposed BUSA technique are compared with other existing methods regarding the accuracy, AUC, precision, recall, and power. In that, the developed framework has attained better results to classify depression rates.

            "heading": "1 Introduction",
            "text": "Generally, EEG is an electrical activity used to record the brain in the scalp (Satapathy and Loganathan 2021). It is used to measure the electrical signal of the brain with the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) (Li and Huang 2021). Moreover, it will deliver the mental activity-related information, and the EEG signals are unique, non-stationary, and weak because they contain much noise (Nagabushanam et al. 2020). So, EEG signals are the most crucial task to process and analyze EEG signals (Rus et al. 2017). It includes four jobs for processing like feature selection, feature extraction, classification, and preprocessing(Sreedharan et al. 2018). The basic process of signal analysis in EEG is detailed in fig.1.\nFurthermore, it deals with the classification and feature extraction of EEG signals and transfers the gained EEG signal to the feature vector with the help of the classifier (Zazzaro et al. 2019). For better analysis of EEG signal, the feature extraction to the certain EEG category is needed (Kim et al. 2018). Moreover, feature extraction extracts relevant and meaningful data or information for assisting good analysis (Barata et al. 2018; Scapicchio et al. 2021). Also starts with raw signal data of EEG and creates the values of the feature vector (Rudas and Laki 2019). However, signal processing of EEG contains Autoregressive (AR), Fourier transform; entropy and discrete wavelet transform (Gupta and Pachori 2020). This provides a wide range of EEG signals which is useful to the time-frequency transformation and contains various sub-bands to attain accurate information (Khare and Bajaj 2020). Moreover, the AR technique contains forecasted variable interests that are helpful to linear combinations of variable past values (B\u00fcy\u00fck\u015fahin and Ertekin 2019). Additionally, the coefficient of AR technique is helpful to feature vector of BCI system but it is more difficult to gather the transient features of EEG signals because of noisy signal and error rate (Subasi et al. 2019; Gu et al. 2021).\nNonetheless, many techniques were developed for feature extraction of EEG signals, but it has the issue of information loss (Islam et al. 2021). The main issues of the EEG signal are noisy data, miss classification, and loss of information (Rajasekar and Pushpalatha 2020; Amin et al. 2019). There are a lot of techniques introduced to overcome these issues, such as the EMD-AR\ntechnique (Zhang et al. 2018), EEG-AR model (Ouyang et al. 2020), convolution neural system (Dose et al. 2018), and so on, but has the issues of noise in the signal, loss of information, improper classification (Algan and Ulusoy 2021). So, this paper has developed a novel AR and deep learning algorithm for modeling and analysis of EEG signals. It will solve the problem of information loss noise error.\nThe arrangement of this article is structured as follows. The related work based on EEG signal is detailed in section 2, and the system model and problem statement are elaborated in section 3. Also, the process of the planned methodology is described in section 4. Finally, achieved outcomes of the developed technique are mentioned in section 5, and the conclusion was detailed in section 6.\n2 Related Works\nA few recent literature surveys based on EEG signal is detailed below,\nZhang et al.(2018) have proposed an EEG-based Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) and Auto-Regressive (AR) technique for classifying the emotional data. Initially, the EMD technique is employed and decomposed to the EEG signal; it will calculate the features based on the function of intrinsic mode. Thus the developed technique attains 86.28% in emotion recognition, but noise present in the signal is high.\nEEG is mostly used as a tool for assisting diagnosis in epilepsy. It has recorded the epilepsy diagnosis of the patient. Ouyang et al.(2020) were designed an EEG AR model to predict the error in the patient through epilepsy control. Thus the technique assists the diagnosis using epilepsy without the discharge of epileptiform. However, the classification rate of patient diagnosis is less because of the noisy signals.\nZhanget al.(2017) have developed an AR technique and wavelength packet rottenness to classify the signal based on the brain system. Moreover, the AR coefficient calculates the features depending on the assembling, and the sub-band has decomposed the EEG signals. Thus the calculated feature extraction is fed into the vector machine to classify EEG signal. But the process of classification takes more time to classify the signal.\nGenerally, EEG and Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) are used to increase the classification's performance. Dose et al.(2018) have proposed a convolution neural system for generalized learning features. It will reduce the dimension, and a fully connected layer is helpful for classification. Thus the developed technique attains better results in classification accuracy as 80.38%. But it has various dimensions, so some misclassification has occurred.\nZhang et al.(2019) have designed a convolutional recurrent attention technique for encoding the EEG signals high-level representation and generalized pattern with good performance. Moreover, the recurrent attention technique explores EEG signals of temporal dynamics; it has mainly focused on discriminative temporal periods. But it has the problem of error noise in the signal, so it is more difficult to attain better outcomes in EEG signal.\nThe key step process of this research work is described as follows,\n\u2022 The normal and abnormal EEG signal standard dataset was initially taken from a net\nsource and trained in the system.\n\u2022 Consequently, a novel Bat based UNET signal analysis model is designed in the\nMATLAB environment.\n\u2022 Then the present noise in the EEG signal is removed in the preprocessing frame. \u2022 Then the preprocessed signal enters into the classification layer of the optimized deep\nlearning model.\n\u2022 While testing process, the sensed patient EEG dataset is trained to the system; by\nmatching the patient EEG dataset with normal EEG dataset, the Depression rate is predicted successfully in the MATLAB environment. \u2022 Hereafter, the evaluated metrics are validated with other existing models in terms of\naccuracy, AUC, power, precision, and recall.\n3 System Model and Problem Statement\nSeveral neural-based algorithms were used to estimate the brain signal; EEG has been taken, then to analyze the health of the brain signal. Moreover,the sampling frequency regularized the EEG signal by converting the signal to 256Hz. Furthermore, feature extraction process was done to analyze the signal based on the activity of the electrical brain. Using Fourier and wavelet transform, the important features are set. But it has a problem in classifying EEG signals because of noise signals, less accuracy, and high execution time. The system model and problem definition are detailed in fig.2.\nThe EEG signal system plays a vital role in analyzing the human depression rate. However, the key demerits of the EEG signal system are less accuracy in depression classification. The automated type is impossible in the EEG signaling framework if the depression ranges are not classified. In addition, if the data is too complex, then it reports very few depression classification measures. Also, the conventional model takes more time to complete the process.\n4 Proposed BUSA Methodology for EEG Signal Classification\nIn the beginning phase, the EEG signals are taken from the standard datasets and trained in the system. Then a novel Bat based UNET signal analysis (BUSA) framework is designed in the MATLAB environment. In the initial phase, the errors are removed in the preprocessing layers. Hereafter, the error-free data enters into the classification layer. Thus the architecture of the proposed technique is shown in fig.3.\nThe fitness of the bat is utilized to specify the depression rate from the trained EEG signal. Finally, the presented model is validated concerning the accuracy, precision, AUC, recall, and power.\n4.1 Pre-processing\nGenerally, the collected dataset of EEG signal presents a large level of noise that occurs due to various reasons. Thus the noise occurs based on the body of motion collecting EEG signals. The collected datasets are transferred to the convolutional layer for removing the error and noise present in the dataset using Eqn. (1),\n =\n\u2212= m\na i kk m 1\n1 (1)\nWhere, ik is denoted as the rate of input EEG signal and k is considered as the mean value of the input dataset. Moreover, is denoted as preprocessing and m is considered as noise present in\nthe EEG signal. Thus the preprocessing helps to attain perfect classification of depression rate also it will change the raw signal into a normal neutral signal.\n4.2 Feature Extraction\nThen the preprocessed dataset is sent to the Maxpooling layer, which will extract the features of the EEG signal with the help of the Band-pass Butterworth filter. Thus, feature extraction happens based on common frequency bands such as theta, alpha, delta, and beta. Moreover, the frequency range of delta was 0.5-4 Hz, and the frequency range of theta was 4-8 Hz. Also, alpha has a frequency range\nof 8-13 Hz, and the frequency range of beta was 13-30 Hz. The feature extraction's main process is to extract the related features of depression rate based on time-frequency series.\nMoreover, bat fitness is used in the developed technique for extracting the features of the input EEG signal based on the function of time or frequency and signal energy. It will convert the discrete-time signal into a discrete frequency sequence using eqn. (2).\n( ) 1,.......1,0 1 0\n2\n\u2212== =\n=\n\u2212\nmpforethkK m\na\nm\nmpj\nix\n\n(2)\nWhere m is denoted as the number of samples and ( )th is designated as the signal. Moreover, p\nis called a time-domain signal. The signal dimension provides more information near the nature of the system, and the fractional extent is used to estimate the experimental data dimension. Moreover, the correlation dimension redirects the degree of the association among state-space points that measure the system's complexity. Thus the probability of points in the same set is obtained using Eqn. (3).\n( ) ( ) ( ) ( )( ) \u2212\u2212\u2212= jkikfDDtQ 1 2 (3)\nLet, ( )tQ is denoted as the correlation integral and  is called as the probability of complexity in the system. Moreover, D is denoted as the dimension of the estimated slope value, ( )ik and ( )jk\nis denoted as the fractional dimension of the EEG signal.\n4.3 Feature Selection\nGenerally, feature selection is the process of pattern recognition it will select the features based on the subset. Generally, feature selection enhances classification accuracy performance and deals with high-dimensional data. Thus the difference of the generated new features is compared with depressed patients and normal patients. While the vector length of each chromosome corresponds to one of the features, it will select the feature, and the feature selection happens based on the k value of samples. At the same time, the k value is less than 0.05 means that the features are selected. Moreover, feature selection is based on relative power, center frequency, correlation dimension, power spectral entropy, band power, and DFT. The process of the developed framework is detailed in fig.4.\n4.4 Classification\nFurthermore, selected features are sent to the fully connected layer and update the fitness function of a bat in this layer. Initially, it identified the rate of depression in the collected EEG signal by comparing normal EEG signals with the help of bat fitness. Next, calculate the distance between the selected and unknown samples using bat fitness obtained by eqn.

Thus the\ndesigned algorithm of the BUSA framework is detailed in algorithm.1 and the flowchart of the designed BUSA framework is shown in fig.5.\n5 Results and Discussion\nInitially, the proposed BUSA framework is implemented in the MATLAB tool, and the efficiency of the developed replica is measured with other existing techniques regarding the accuracy, recall, precision, AUC and power. Furthermore, the introduced method classifies the depression rate of EEG signals. Finally, a successive score of the presented model is compared with other models to verify the proficiency score of the designed model.\n5.1 Case Study\nGenerally, EEG is one of the non-invasive techniques used to monitor brain activity with various classifications and detection of brain disorders. Moreover, depression is a prevalent disease it will cause disability. So classifying the depression rate using EEG signal is the most critical task. Thus the developed BUSA framework is implemented in this case study. Initially, collect the EEG signal dataset of various patients based on the channel location. Thus the channel location includes F7, Fz, F6, C6, C7, Cz, H6, H8, T2, T5, T3, O2, O1, FP1, O6, FP2, etc., and the channel location is detailed in fig.6.\nThen the collected EEG signal dataset is sent to the convolutional layer. The preprocessing contains a 1-42Hz Bandpass filter for removing the errors and noise present in the signal. Additionally, the preprocessed dataset is sent to the Maxpooling layer and the layer extracts the\nfeatures based on the channel location. Moreover, feature extraction includes correlation dimension, DFT, and band power. Thus the band power contains beta, alpha, theta, delta, and gamma also, the range of the frequency is varies based on the channel location. The use of feature selection is choosing important information used for a classifier. Thus the features selection maximizes the relevant features to the classifier's target. At the next level, the fitness function of a bat in the fully connected layer is updated which identifies and classifies the depression rate of the patient to the normal patient. Moreover, it classifies the EEG signal based on normal and depressed patients. Thus the classified depression rate is detailed in the Table1.\nThus the depression rate is classified based on the channel location of each electrode also the location of the channel varies while changes in the EEG signal. Thus the developed BUSA framework attains better results to classify depression rate.\n5.2 Performance metrics\nThe planned BUSA model is implemented in LABVIEW or MATLAB tool, and the success rate of the designed scheme was analyzed using comparison assessment with regards to accuracy, AUC, power, recall, and precision. Thus the achieved performance is compared with other existing techniques such as Classification of Emotion by AutoRegressive (AR) and Empirical Decomposition (CEAED) model (Zhang and Zhang 2018), Analysis of EEG AR Modeling (AARM) (Ouyang et al. 2020), Classification of EEG signals using AR and Wavelet Packet Decomposition (AR-WPD) (Zhang et al. 2017), end-to-end deep learning method to MI-EEG signal classification (E2E-EEG) (Dose et al. 2018), Convolutional Recurrent Attention (CRA) technique (Zhang et al. 2019), Classification of Normal and Depressed EEG signals (CND) (Akbari et al. 2021) and Prediction of Major Depressive Disorder (PMDD) (Hasanzadeh et al. 2019)."

            "text": "In the medical field, EEG signal system has attained the major contribution to analyzing the brain function of individuals. Hence, the depression rate of the brain signal was estimated using any neural approaches or optimization framework. The main drawback behind in the EEG signal system is a noisy signal. The noisy signal can reduce classification accuracy by affording the low depression rate estimation so, in this work, a novel BUSA technique is proposed to classify the depression rate of patients. Here, the classification parameter of the UNET was tuned by bat fitness to gain the finest results. By the mathematical modeling in the MATLAB, the proposed technique gained an accuracy of 99.64%, recall of 99.95%, AUC of 99.2%, and precision of 99.98%. Hence, the proposed BUSA model has improved the depression rate classification accuracy up to 20% compared to other techniques.
