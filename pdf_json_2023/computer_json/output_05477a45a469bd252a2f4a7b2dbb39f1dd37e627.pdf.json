    "abstractText": "Physical-layer key generation (PKG) exploits the reciprocity and randomness of wireless channels to generate a symmetric key between two legitimate communication ends. However, in multi-cell systems, PKG suffers from severe pilot contamination due to the reuse of pilots in different cells. In this paper, we invoke multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) for adaptively shaping the environment and enhancing the PKG performance. To this end, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the weighted sum key rate (WSKR) by jointly optimizing the precoding matrices at the base stations (BSs) and the phase shifts at the RISs. For addressing the non-convexity of the problem, we derive an upper bound of the WSKR and prove its tightness. To tackle the upper bound maximization problem, we apply an alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithm to divide the joint optimization into two subproblems. We apply the Lagrangian dual approach based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions for the sub-problem of precoding matrices and adopt a projected gradient ascent (PGA) algorithm for the sub-problem of phase shifts. Simulation results confirm the near-optimal performance of the proposed algorithm and the effectiveness of RISs for improving the WSKR via mitigating pilot contamination.",

INTRODUCTION\nThe ever-increasing connectivity among a large number of devices and the ubiquitous wireless communications have aroused great awareness to establish secure communication on the fly [1]. Conventionally, secure communication is guaranteed by applying cryptographic encryption mechanisms in the application layer [2]. Particularly, symmetric keys should be distributed to legitimate parties in these mechanisms before the actual communication takes place. However, existing cryptographic techniques face difficulties to realize secret key sharing in ad-hoc and mobile networks [3]. As an alternative, physical-layer key generation (PKG) exploits the intrinsic reciprocity and randomness of wireless channels to generate a pair of secret keys between the desired legitimate ends [4]. Furthermore, due to the existence of spatial decorrelation, an eavesdropper, Eve, cannot obtain any information about the generated keys if she locates more than half a wavelength away from the legitimate ends, i.e., Alice and Bob [5]\u2013[7].\nThe process of PKG generally consists of four steps: channel sounding, quantization, information reconciliation, and privacy amplification [7]. During the channel probing step, Alice and Bob exchange pilots to acquire highly correlated channel estimations. Then, the extracted channel estimations are respectively quantized into bit sequences at Alice and Bob in the quantization step. Also, during the information reconciliation step, error-correcting codes are adopted to correct the mismatched bits between Alice and Bob. Finally, privacy amplification is employed to erase the bits that might have leaked information to Eve in the previous probing and reconciliation steps. From the above steps, it can be seen that PKG highly relies on the inherent randomness and reciprocity of wireless channels. However, the desired secret key rate may not be guaranteed in some harsh propagation environments, such as wave-blockage environments [8], [9]. Fortunately, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), which has emerged as a disruptive wireless communication technology, has great potential to address this problem. In fact, RIS is a planar surface comprising a large number of low-cost passive reflecting elements [10]\u2013 [12]. These elements can independently adjust the phase shifts to collaboratively customize the wireless propagation environment [12]. Therefore, it is expected that deploying RIS in secure communication can facilitate the required PKG. In particular, when the direct link between Alice\n3 and Bob is blocked, RIS could shape a RIS-induced fluctuating channel to serve as a controllable randomizer for generating a secret key.\nHowever, to fully unleash the potential of the RIS for improving PKG performance, the optimization of the phase shifts of RIS is required. To date, several studies have focused on the design of phase shifts of RIS [9], [13]\u2013[17]. For instance, [9], [13], [14] studied the reflection coefficients optimization in single-input single-output (SISO) systems with only one legitimate user. In particular, the authors in [13] assumed the RIS-induced channel of the eavesdropper is independent from that of the legitimate ends. Based on this, they derived the expression of the key generation rate (KGR) capacity and optimized the on/off states of the RIS units. Furthermore, in [14], the authors considered RIS-assisted PKG with multiple non-colluding eavesdroppers. They designed a semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and successive convex approximation (SCA)-based algorithm to maximize the secret key capacity lower bound. Then, a RIS-assisted multiuser key generation scheme was studied in [9], where the RIS configuration was optimized to maximize the sum secret key rate of multiple users. On the other hand, [15]\u2013[17] investigated the beamforming optimization in multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems. In particular, [15] proposed a lowcomplexity block successive upper-bound minimization (BSUM) with the mirror-prox method to optimize the reflective beamforming at the RIS and the transmit beamforming at the base station (BS), with the consideration of the spatial correlation at both the BS and the RIS. In addition, [16] treated the coupled precoding matrix and phase-shift matrix as an equivalent variable and designed a water-filling algorithm to acquire its optimal solution. Then, they recovered the two matrices from the optimized variable. Furthermore, to obtain a computationally efficient suboptimal solution to the non-convex problem in [16], the authors in [17] adopted a machine learning-based algorithm to achieve a higher KGR.\nNevertheless, all of these works i.e., [9], [13]\u2013[17], focus on the design of single-cell systems, while practical RIS-based PKG methods in multi-cell systems are still lacked. Indeed, in multicell systems, the same pilot pool is reused in different cells due to the limited time and frequency resources giving rise to the pilot contamination problem [18]\u2013[20]. Over the last couple of years, considerable research efforts have been devoted for studying the impact of pilot contamination on spectral and energy efficiencies and the corresponding methods for alleviating the negative impacts caused by pilot interference [19]\u2013[23]. However, all of these works aim for reducing the uplink channel estimation error that do not align the goal of PKG which aims for improving the reciprocity between channel estimations in the uplink and downlink. Indeed, pilot\n4 contamination exists in both the uplink and downlink channel probing phase in PKG systems that introduces non-reciprocal interference to the channel estimations at the BSs and the user terminals (UTs). Therefore, this channel asymmetry caused by multi-cell pilot contamination is expected to jeopardize the key generation performance. To tackle this problem, we propose to employ multiple RISs to assist the PKG in multi-cell networks. Specifically, by carefully altering the phase shifts introduced by multiple RISs, the inter-cell pilot interference reflected by the RISs and the interference in the direct channel can be harnessed such that they can be destructively superimposed at the desired communication nodes to minimize the interference power. Therefore, the proposed paradigm provides a new degrees of freedom (DoF) to facilitate multi-cell PKG in conjunction with the precoding matrices at the BSs. However, the BSs\u2019 precoding matrices and the RISs\u2019 phase shifts have to be jointly optimized to fully unleash the potential of RISs for effective KGR provisioning. More importantly, existing techniques in [9], [13]\u2013[17] cannot be directly applied to multi-cell PKG systems since the inter-cell pilot contamination is not taken into consideration.\nTo address the above issues, this paper investigates the PKG method in multi-cell systems. We introduce RISs to combat multi-cell pilot contamination by jointly optimizing the precoding matrices at the BSs and the phase shifts at the RISs. More specifically, the main contributions of this paper are as follows.\n\u2022 We propose a novel RIS-aided multi-cell PKG framework based on the precoding matrices\nat the BSs and the phase shifts at the RISs. We then derive a closed-form KGR expression that facilitates the formulation of an optimization problem to maximize the weighted sum key rate (WSKR) of all the cells. Since the formulated problem is non-convex and difficult to solve, we derive a tight upper bound of the WSKR and maximize the upper bound. \u2022 To tackle the upper bound maximization problem, we employ an alternating optimization\n(AO)-based algorithm to alternately obtain a high-quality suboptimal solution. To be specific, a Lagrangian dual algorithm based on the KKT conditions is applied to design the precoding matrices at the BSs and a PGA algorithm is adopted to optimize the phase shifts at the RISs. \u2022 Simulation results verify that the WSKR by the proposed algorithm approaches the upper\nbound, showing the near-optimal performance. Also, a significant WSKR improvement can be observed with the increase of RIS elements number. Finally, distributed RISs, with each RIS being located in the proximity of some UTs, offer rich spatial diversity to maximize\nthe WSKR.\nNotations: In this paper, CA\u00d7B denotes the space of complex matrices of size A\u00d7B.

Finally, feature-to-key processing is performed to convert the channel estimations into secret keys [6], [9]. The specific procedures are shown as follows.\n1) Parameter Design: In this step, the BSs design the precoding matrices Pk, k \u2208 {1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , K}, and phase shifts v according to some statistical CSI. In particular, the UTs in all the cells\ntransmit orthogonal sounding signals such that the BSs can obtain the channel covariance\n2Note that different multipath delays incurred by the pilot delays are ignored because the pilots are assumed to be synchronized\nto maximize the power of multi-cell interference that serves as a worst case scenario [19].\nmatrices between the BSs and the UTs. Then, the BSs design the parameters Pk and v via the proposed optimization algorithm, which will be elaborated in Section IV. 2) Channel Probing: In this step, the BSs and UTs probe the channel alternatively and extract\nthe reciprocal channel characteristics with the help of the precoding matrices and reflection coefficients. In the downlink, each BS transmits the downlink pilot signals processed by the optimized precoding matrix Pk. Then, the UTs estimate the combined channels from the received signals. In the uplink, each UT transmits the same pilot signals. The pilot is reflected by the RISs and received by the BSs. Then, the BSs estimate the channels from the received signals and utilize the precoding matrices Pk to form the combined channels. 3) Feature-to-Key Processing: Once the BSs and UTs acquire the channel estimations, they\nemploy some quantization method to generate raw key bits. Finally, information reconciliation and privacy amplification steps are performed to produce the secret keys.\nRemark 1. In the parameter design step, the prior information to design the precoding matrices and phase shifts are the channel covariance matrices. Due to the fact that the covariance\n8 matrices alter slowly across time in dense scattering environments [26], we can obtain these matrices from the previous several time slots by adopting some existing estimation methods e.g., [19], [21]. Upon the parameter design phase is completed, the BSs and UTs can perform multiple channel probing rounds within some channel coherence times. Each channel probing round is completed within one coherence time to guarantee the similarity of the uplink and downlink channel estimations. Meanwhile, different channel probing rounds should be performed in different coherence times to introduce randomness to the secret keys.\nIn this paper, we first focus on the channel probing step, where the multi-cell pilot contamination exists and then propose an algorithm to design the precoding matrices and phase shifts to improve the PKG performance."

The process of channel probing is described as follows.\nThe channel sounding step contains two phases, i.e., the downlink phase and the uplink phase, respectively. In the downlink, BS k transmits the downlink public known pilot X \u2208 CMe\u00d7Me with XXH = IMe and Me \u2264 M is the number of radio-frequency (RF) chains.

(7)\nGiven the combined channel gains yk and zk in (3) and (6), the closed-form expression of the KGR can be derived as follows.\n10\nTheorem 1.

The variable is defined as v\u0304 \u2206 = v\u2217 for the sake of notational simplicity.\nProof. Please see Appendix A. Remark 2. When the precoding matrices at the BSs are not optimized, i.e., Pi = \u221a Pi M IM , and the RISs are not deployed, the KGR between BS k and UT k is given by\nRk = ln det\n( K\u2211\nj=1\nRdk,j + IM\n)\n\u2212 ln det\n\n\nK\u2211\nj=1\nRdk,j + IM \u2212 Pk M Rdk,k\n( K\u2211\ni=1\nPi M Rdi,k + IM\n)\u22121\nRdk,k\n\n ,\n(9)\nwhere Pi denotes the transmit power at BS i. Furthermore, we present a proposition of the KGR performance as follows.\nProposition 1. Rk decreases monotonically with increasing Pi, i 6= k, and the eigenvalues of Rdi,k and R d k,j, j 6= k. Also, Rk approaches 0 when these values are sufficiently large.\nProof. Please see Appendix B.\nProposition 1 proves that the KGR between BS k and UT k decreases with the transmit power of BSs in other cells, i.e., Pi, i 6= k, and the channel gain of the interference channels, i.e., \u03bb\u2113 ( Rdi,k ) , i 6= k, and \u03bb\u2113 ( Rdk,j ) , j 6= k, \u2113 \u2208 {1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,M}. In addition, Rk tends to 0 when these interference is sufficiently large. Therefore, the crux of the multi-cell PKG is to effectively mitigate the pilot contamination in the uplink and downlink.\n11\nRemark 3. From (8), the KGR Rk is decided by the statistical channel information (CSI), i.e., the channel covariance matrices, and the parameters, i.e., the precoding matrices and the phaseshifting vector. In this paper, we assume that the covariance matrices are perfectly known by the BSs in the parameter design phase3 and we focus on the design of precoding matrices and phase-shifting vector.\nNow, we jointly design the precoding matrices and phase shifts to improve the key generation performance.

Constraint C1 represents the power of the precoding matrices at each BS should be less than the maximum transmit power PA [27]. Constraint C2 represents the modulus constraint of each reflection coefficient at the RISs [29].\nNote that the objective function WSKR is non-convex w.r.t. Pi and v\u0304 since these variables are coupled in the matrix inversion operation. Additionally, the unit-modulus constraint C2 is also non-convex. Hence, Problem (10) is generally NP-hard and difficult to find the globally optimal solution [30].

Therefore, yk and zk are conditionally independent given z\u0303k, which means yk, z\u0303k, and zk form a Markov chain yk \u2192 z\u0303k \u2192 zk. According to the\n3The impact of imperfect statistical CSI on PKG performance is left to future work.\n12\ndata-procesing inequality [31], an upper bound of the KGR can be expressed as Rk = I(yk; zk) \u2264 I(yk; z\u0303k) \u2206= Rubk . Then, the closed-form expression of Rubk can be derived as follows.\nTheorem 2. The KGR of k-th cell, Rk, is upper bounded by\nRubk = ln det\n( K\u2211\ni=1\nPiMi,kP H i + IMe\n) \u2212 ln det ( K\u2211\ni=1\nPiMi,kP H i + IMe \u2212PkNk,kPHk\n)\n, (11)\nwhere\nMi,k = R d i,k + ( v\u0304H \u2297 IM ) Rri,k ( v\u0304H \u2297 IM )H , (12) Nk,k = ( Rdk,k + ( v\u0304H \u2297 IM ) Rrk,k (v\u0304 \u2297 IM) ) R\u22121z\u0303k ( Rdk,k + ( v\u0304H \u2297 IM ) Rrk,k (v\u0304 \u2297 IM) ) . (13)\nProof. Please see Appendix C.\nRemark 4. We next prove the tightness of the derived upper bound. Specifically, the sufficient condition for achieving the upper bound, i.e., Rubk = Rk, is I(yk; z\u0303k|zk) = 0. In other words, yk, zk, and z\u0303k also form a Markov chain yk \u2192 zk \u2192 z\u0303k [31]. Therefore, one typical case for the equality hold is Me = M such that I(yk; z\u0303k|Pkz\u0303k) = H(z\u0303k|Pkz\u0303k) \u2212 H(z\u0303k|yk,Pkz\u0303k) = 0. This means when the number of RF chains at the BS is the same as the number of antennas, the derived upper bound is tight and equal to the actual KGR.\nThanks to Theorem 2, the objective function is significantly simplified. Then, the upper bound\noptimization problem can be expressed as\nmaximize Pi,i\u2208{1,\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7 ,K},v\u0304\nK\u2211\nk=1\nwkR ub k\ns.t. C1,C2.

Please see Appendix D.\nNext, the value of \u03bbi, i \u2208 {1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , K}, should be chosen for ensuring the power constraint at each BS in (14) is satisfied, which means\n\u03bbi ( tr(PiP H i )\u2212 PA ) = 0. (18)\nTo this end, recalling the KKT condition in (17), we can rewrite the vec (P) as\nvec (P) = (diag (\u03bb1IMMe, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , \u03bbKIMMe) + F)\u22121 a (19)\n= diag ( (\u03bb1IMMe + F1) \u22121 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , (\u03bbKIMMe + FK)\u22121 ) a, (20)\n14\nwhere\nF = K\u2211\nk=1\nwk\n(\nNTk \u2297 ( IMe +PNkP\nH )\u22121 )\n= diag (F1, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 ,FK) , (21)\nand a = \u2211K\nk=1wk\n((\nMTk \u2297 ( PMkP H + IMe )\u22121 ) vec (P) ) = [ aT1 , \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , aTK ]T . Thus, we can\nexpress the Pi at BS i as\nvec (Pi) = (\u03bb1IMMe + Fi) \u22121 ai.

Since fi,m \u2265 0, it can be verified that fi(\u03bbi) is a monotonically decreasing function w.r.t. \u03bbi.\nTherefore, if \u03c6i(0) \u2264 PA, the optimized Pi is vec ( PKKTi ) = F\u22121i ai when \u03bbi is set to 0.

The two BSs are located at (0, 0, 10) and (600, 0, 0), respectively, while there are two UTs at (280, 0, 0) and (320, 0, 0), respectively [34]. There is one RIS deployed at (300, 0, 0), which is the cell boundary.\nFirst, Fig. 4 shows the convergence behavior of Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2, which correspond to the left and right subfigures, respectively. It can be seen that Algorithm 1 and Algorithm 2 converge monotonically for all of the considered values of M and N . This verifies the excellent convergence properties of Algorithms 1 and 2. Furthermore, Fig. 5 depicts the achieved WSKR versus the number of AO iterations. As can be observed, the WSKR converges rapidly to\n19\nstationary values after a few iterations on average. For N = 80, the proposed algorithm converges after around 19 iterations on average. For the case with more RIS elements, i.e., N = 100, the number of iterations required for the convergence is 25. This is because the solution space is enlarged when more optimization variables are involved and thus more iterations are required for convergence.\nNext, in Fig. 6, the WSKR versus the maximum transmit power at each BS for different Me is plotted. First, it can be observed that the WSKRs in all of the settings increase with the transmit power, since the impact of noise becomes insignificant. At the same time, the WSKR increases\n20\nwith diminishing returns at high transmit power region. This is because only the transmit power at the BSs is increased while the power of the UTs is fixed that remains the system performance bottleneck. In particular, the BSs\u2019 channel estimations are still impaired by the noise components, causing the saturation in the WSKR. Furthermore, it can be seen that the WSKR increases with Me, since a higher dimensional channel features can be exploited with a larger Me. Finally, Fig. 6 shows the tightness of the derived upper bound. Specifically, the performance gap between WSKR and the upper bound is reduced with Me increasing and becomes exact when Me = M . This is because having a larger Me, the dimension of Pkzk approaches that of zk. Thus, the upper bound I(yk;Pkzk) becomes tight and accurate in describing I(yk; zk) such that the proposed design is effective.\nTo illustrate the impact of the proposed algorithm on the channel reciprocity, we show the BDR result in Fig. 7. The BDR is defined as the ratio between the number of disagreement bits and the number of total bits [2], [5]\u2013[7]. It can be seen that the BDR of No-RIS baseline scheme is much higher than the proposed RIS-aided scheme and the former saturates at around 0.36 BDR in the high transmit power regime. This is because the non-reciprocal interference significantly degrades the similarity of the uplink and downlink channel estimations. In contrast, for the proposed RIS-aided PKG scheme, a lower BDR can be achieved with the increases of RIS elements number N , since the RIS is equipped with a higher ability to suppress the pilot contamination-caused inter-cell interference with larger N .\n21\nFig. 8 shows the WSKR of different PKG schemes versus the number of RIS elements N . Firstly, as can be observed, the WSKRs of the two baseline schemes are significantly low and approach zero. This is because the UTs are located at the cell edge and suffer from severe intercell pilot contamination. In contrast, the WSKR of the proposed RIS-based scheme is improved significantly the performance gain increases with the number of RIS elements. This is because the multi-cell interference in the uplink and downlink is eliminated by adjusting the phase shifts of the RIS and with more RIS elements in place, the proposed design becomes more flexible to create pencil-like beams to focus the reflected signals on the target UTs and BSs.\n22\nFig. 9 presents the WSKR versus the coordinate of the RIS (xRIS, 0, 0). We vary the location of the RIS from near the cell center, xRIS = 20 m, to the cell boundary, xRIS = 300 m. It can be observed that the RandPhase baseline scheme achieves its maximum value when the RIS is located near one of the UTs, i.e., xRIS = 280, which is caused by the array gain brought by the RIS. Also, the proposed algorithm enjoys superior performance than that of the two baseline schemes in all of the considered cases. It is interesting to observe that the WSKR achieved by the proposed algorithm first decreases from xRIS = 20 to xRIS = 140, then increases from xRIS = 140 to xRIS = 280, and finally decreases from xRIS = 280 to xRIS = 300 m. This is mainly caused by the variations of the large-scale fading of the RIS channels. To be specific, the large-scale channel gain of the RIS channel is the product of the gain of the BS-RIS link and that of the RIS-UT link. Thus, for BS 2 and UT 2, the large-scale fading of the RIS channels can be approximated by \u03b60 \u221a\n((600\u2212 xRIS)(320\u2212 xRIS))\u2212\u03b1RIS , which is negligible for the considered 0 \u2264 xRIS \u2264 300. However, for BS 1 and UT 1, when 0 \u2264 xRIS \u2264 280, the large-scale fading of the RIS channels can be approximated by \u03b60 \u221a\n(xRIS(280\u2212 xRIS))\u2212\u03b1RIS , which achieves its minimum value at xRIS = 140 and its maximum value at xRIS = 0 or xRIS = 280. This means that the channel gain is minimal when the RIS is located at the middle point between BS 1 and UT 1, while the gain is maximum when the RIS is located close either to BS 1 or UT 1. Furthermore, when the RIS is located away from UT 1, i.e., 280 < xRIS \u2264 300, the large-scale fading of the RIS channels between BS 1 and UT 1 is given by \u03b60 \u221a (xRIS(xRIS \u2212 280))\u2212\u03b1RIS ,\n23\nwhich decreases with an increasing xRIS. Additionally, it can be observed from Fig. 9 that the WSKR of deploying the RIS close to the BS, i.e., xRIS approaches 0, is less than that of deploying near the UT, i.e., xRIS approaches 280. This is because deploying the RIS close to the cell center is less effective in alleviating the inter-cell pilot contamination.\nFig. 10 shows the WSKR versus the location of the UTs under different schemes. The xcoordinates of UT 1 and UT 2 are xu and 600\u2212 xu, respectively. From this figure, the WSKR of all the schemes decrease with xu being from 100 m to 280 m. This is mainly due to the following two reasons. First, the channel gain between the BSs and UTs decreases as the UTs move away from their home BSs. Second, the inter-cell interference becomes dominated when the UTs move from the cell center to the cell boundary. However, the proposed RIS-aided PKG scheme provides significant performance gain when the UTs are close to the RIS. Specifically, when xu = 280 m, the WSKR of the proposed scheme and the two baseline schemes are 6.57 and 0.49 bits/channel use, respectively. This is because the UTs receive strong reflected signals from the RIS and the inter-cell interference is substantially mitigated by the RIS."

            "text": "In this section, we consider a four-cell scenario to study the optimal RIS deployment and the impact of having single RIS and multiple RISs on the PKG performance. The coordinates of the four BSs are (0, 0), (600, 0), (600, 600), and (0, 600), respectively. The four UTs are located as (280, 0), (320, 0), (280, 600), and (320, 600), respectively.\n24\nFor the single RIS case, we consider 3 schemes: Scheme-1: The RIS moves from BS 1 to BS 2; Scheme-2: The RIS moves from point D to point B; Scheme-3: The RIS moves from BS 3 to BS 2. For the two RISs case, we consider 3 schemes: Scheme-1: RIS 1 moves from BS 1 to BS 2 and RIS 2 moves from BS 3 to BS 4; Scheme-2: RIS 1 moves from BS 1 to BS 4, and RIS 2 moves from BS 3 to BS 2; Scheme-3: RIS 1 moves from point D to point B, and RIS 2 moves from point A to point C.\nFig. 12 shows the WSKR versus the coordinate of the RIS under different schemes. Firstly, for\n25\nthe single-RIS scenario, it is seen that Scheme-1 achieves the maximum WSKR at xRIS = 280 m and xRIS = 320 m, which are the locations of UT 1 and UT 2, respectively. This observation is consistent with that of the two-cell system. Additionally, the WSKR of Scheme-1 is significantly higher than that of Scheme-2 and Scheme-3. The reason behind this is the channel gain of the RIS-related channel is higher in Scheme-1 when the RIS is close to the two UTs. Secondly, for the two-RISs scenario, the WSKR curves are similar to that of single-RIS case and the WSKR of Scheme-1 has the maximum value at xRIS = 280 m and xRIS = 320 m. The reason is that the RISs are respectively closer to the two of the UTs at these two points. By comparing the WSKR of single-RIS and two-RISs at xRIS = 280 and xRIS = 320, we can observe that two-RISs achieve higher performance gain than the single-RIS case. This is because when multiple RISs are deployed in the network, the distance between each UT and its nearest RIS is reduced due to spatial diversity, which thus increases the channel gain. This observation confirms that the PKG performance of the UTs is usually dominated by the closest RIS.\nFinally, to verify the randomness of the obtained bit sequences for cryptographic applications, we conduct the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) randomness test [35] on the quantized bits. Note that NIST is widely adopted to evaluate the randomness of truerandom and pseudo-random number generators. The output of the NIST is p-values, which is examined to ensure uniformity. The tested sequence is considered to pass the test if the p-value is greater than 0.01. In the simulation, we perform 9 kinds of NIST items for 10, 000 trials, with the length of each sequence being 2048 bits. The test results are shown in Table I, where the\n26\npass ratio represents the number of passed trials over the 10, 000 trials. As can be observed, the p-values of all the test items are significantly greater than 0.01, which means the sequence can be considered to be uniformly distributed. Also, the pass ratios are all higher than 98%. This confirms the excellent randomness of the bits generated by the proposed PKG scheme."

            "text": "In this paper, we incorporated RISs in multi-cell PKG systems to alleviate the negative impact of multi-cell pilot contamination on PKG performance. Specifically, we studied the WSKR maximization problem by jointly optimizing the precoding matrices at the BSs and the phase shifts at the RISs. To tackle this non-convex problem, we derived a tight upper bound of the objective function. To solve the upper bound maximization problem, we applied an AO-based algorithm that alternatively solves the sub-problem for precoding matrices and the sub-problem for phase-shifting vector. In particular, a Lagrangian dual algorithm and a PGA algorithm were employed to design the precoding matrices and the phase-shifting vector, respectively. Simulation results verified the WSKR of the cell edge UTs under multi-cell pilot contamination can be unsatisfactory when the RISs are not deployed. By contrast, the proposed RIS-aided PKG scheme can achieve high WSKR even in harsh channel conditions. Moreover, a lower BDR can be observed with the increase of RIS elements number.\nAPPENDIX"
