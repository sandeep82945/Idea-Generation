With the significant increase in users on social media platforms, a new means of political campaigning has appeared. Twitter and Facebook are now notable campaigning tools during elections. Indeed, the candidates and their parties now take to the internet to interact and spread their ideas. In this paper, we aim to identify political communities formed on Twitter during the 2022 French presidential election and analyze each respective community. We create a large-scale Twitter dataset containing 1.2 million users and 62.6 million tweets that mention keywords relevant to the election. We perform community detection on a retweet graph of users and propose an in-depth analysis of the stance of each community. Finally, we attempt to detect offensive tweets and automatic bots, comparing across communities in order to gain insight into each candidate’s supporter demographics and online campaign strategy. 1. conclusion and future work In this paper, we have leveraged graph-based community detection methods to gather insights into each of the most significant candidates’ online campaigns for the 2022 French presidential election. We have been able to build a portrait of the average voter for each can-
didate, the interest they carry in different political subjects, their geolocalization, and their language habits. We have also presented results on the usage of automated accounts, or the lack thereof, in each community. Based on the community detection of political communities, a relevant study could be to analyze of the impact of major political events or debates. French elections are based on a two-turn system, with the first turn aiming at narrowing down the the list of candidates and only keeping the two largest ones.
