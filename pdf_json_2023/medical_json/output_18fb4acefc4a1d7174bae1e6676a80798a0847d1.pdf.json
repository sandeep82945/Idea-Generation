    "abstractText": "Background: Numerous studies on coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) vaccination safety have been conducted in Saudi Arabia. Even though there is less evidence comparing the side effects of different vaccines and a few of them studied the side effects of mixing different platforms of vaccines. Objectives: This study aimed to evaluate the type and severity of adverse effects following COVID-19 vaccination based on the type and platform of received vaccine and to determine factors that contribute to the occurrence of these side effects. Methods: This cross-sectional comparative study was conducted in Saudi Arabia from January to the end of February 2022 among COVID-19 vaccine recipients through an online survey. Based on the type of vaccines received, we categorized our participants into two groups those who received two doses of either the Pfizer or the AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccines, and those who received mixed vaccination regimen (one dose of Pfizer and one dose of AstraZeneca). Results: The study included 1,340 participants, of which 56.3% received two doses of the Pfizer vaccine while (7%) received two doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine, and 8.8% received mixed vaccines (one dose of the Pfizer vaccine and one dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine). Pain at the injection site was the most frequent local symptom (37.9%) followed by swelling\u00b1redness (27.6%). The local adverse reactions were nearly equal in AstraZeneca and Pfizer vaccines, whereas these were significantly lower in those who received mixed doses (p<0.001). Fever was significantly higher in mixed vaccination regimens compared to other types (p<0.001). The male gender who received the Pfizer vaccine were at higher risk of developing an adverse reaction following vaccination. Unusual side effects (sleep disorders, menstrual irregularities, and symptoms suggestive of diabetic neuropathy) were also reported. Conclusion: The results suggest the overall safety of Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines as well as the mixed vaccination protocol. A heterologous regimen was associated with fewer side effects compared to homologous vaccines. Further studies are needed to assess the long-term side effects.

            "text": "The emergence of the novel SARS-CoV-2 pandemic mandated the rapid development of vaccines to fight against this pandemic and to save millions of lives [1]. Indeed, different vaccine platforms have been used, some of them are traditional approaches, such as inactivated or live attenuated viruses. Other approaches employ newer platforms, such as recombinant proteins and vectors [2].\nThese vaccines represented a significant turning point in vaccine production history due to the short development time and the novelty of the used technology as there were no messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines approved for use in humans prior to BioNTech and Moderna's vaccines [3]. The successful application of mRNA in the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic holds promise as a type of replacement therapy to treat a wide range of incurable diseases by introducing mRNA as a vaccine or therapeutic agent [4].\nSeveral reports of COVID-19 vaccines\u2019 side effects have been published worldwide as well as in Saudi Arabia. These reports were variable depending on the type of vaccine investigated and population characteristics,\nHow to cite this article Mohammed R A, Yazbik R S, Baajajah L H, et al. (January 21, 2023) Side Effects Associated With Homologous and Heterologous COVID-19 Vaccines: A Cross-Sectional Study in Saudi Arabia. Cureus 15(1): e34030. DOI 10.7759/cureus.34030\nmost of them reported relatively common mild-to-moderate side effects [5]. However, a few studies compared the side effects of COVID-19 vaccines, along with the impact of demographic variables, and the presence of comorbidities. Additionally, many of them did not categorize those side effects according to their type (e.g., localized and systemic) and few of them studied the side effects of mixing different types of vaccines [6,7].\nAlthough the COVID-19 pandemic has entered its third consecutive year, the detection of highly transmissible variants raises concern about the consequences of vaccine escape mutations. This condition creates a global demand to intensify vaccination, including booster shots [8].\nWHO has recommended the third and fourth COVID-19 booster doses for all people who completed their essential primary doses. Thus, real-world patient-reported data on the adverse effects of COVID-19 vaccines and who is more likely to experience them in our community is still required to support people in making the critical decision to be vaccinated if a booster dose will be required [9].\nTherefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate the side effects of Pfizer and AstraZeneca as well as the side effects associated with mixing both vaccines among citizens and residents of Saudi Arabia and to determine factors that contribute to the occurrence of these side effects."

The protocol of the study was submitted to the Ibn Sina National College (ISNC) Research Center Ethics Committee and approval (#REC42/1/139) was obtained before starting the study.\nSampling, study participants, and sample size According to Epi-info 7.2.5.0 for Windows (Atlanta, GA: CDC), a sample size of approximately 400 was determined based on the following input criteria: margin of error equal to 5%, the design effect is 1, the cluster is 1, and the expected frequency is 50% [10]. The sampling method is a convenient non-probability sampling in which we asked people who are most accessible like family, friends, colleagues, and neighbors in the community.

The Arabic translation was done by language experts and back-translated by two native speakers to understand any discrepancies. The questionnaire was pilot tested among 50 participants to understand the feasibility and was refined based on feedback. The survey was designed to identify the side effects after receiving a COVID-19 vaccination either local, systemic, allergic, or any uncommon side effects that were related to the vaccines.\nThe questionnaire included socio-demographic characteristics of the participant and questions about data related to vaccines (type of vaccine received, number of doses, presence, and severity of side effects {using a scale of 1-10}, the time after which they experienced the side effects, need for medical assistance for the treatment of those side effects, time taken to completely recover, and if there is a relationship with medical and non-medical factors) were asked. Health status in terms of chronic illnesses, medications, pregnancy or lactation, or any other vaccines received up to one month before the COVID-19 vaccine was asked. It also included a question on the previous history of allergies and associated history of immunodeficiency or taking medication like high-dose corticosteroids, immunosuppressants, or cancer medicines. Additionally, we asked the participant who has a chronic illness to characterize disease pattern before and after vaccination and indicates any observable changes in terms of symptoms or management. The questionnaire also included an additional section to allow the participants to report other unlisted or uncommon side effects that they may have experienced."

            "text": "The Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines are authorized as homologous 2 doses regimens, however, heterologous combinations of vector and mRNA vaccines are already been implemented in many countries including Saudi Arabia [13]. In this study, 119 (8.8%) of the participants received mixed regimens (one dose of the Pfizer vaccine and another dose of the AstraZeneca vaccine). Mixing vaccines of different platforms is associated with more stimulation of cellular immune response and higher neutralizing antibodies so this strategy may improve the vaccines' effectiveness in addition to solving the problem of vaccine shortage in many regions [13]. However, this vaccination strategy is not well understood in terms of efficacy and safety. Therefore, in this study, we aimed to compare the type and frequency of adverse events following the administration of two doses of homologous vaccine with those who received the mixed vaccination approach among Saudi residents and to assess factors that contribute to their occurrence.\n2023 Mohammed et al. Cureus 15(1): e34030. DOI 10.7759/cureus.34030 7 of 10\nThe present study showed that around 66% of the studied participants experienced either local or systemic adverse reactions after COVID-19 vaccination. Pain followed by redness and swelling at the injection site was the most frequent local symptom among vaccine recipients which is nearly equal after the first and the second doses of the vaccines and both types of vaccines.\nVaccines, irrespective of their composition, induce some inflammation at the injection site within the first hours, contributing to pain, redness, and swelling. It is a common concept that pain at the site of injection is a predictive sign of a good vaccine response, however, limited data either support or contradict this concept [14].\nIn our survey, about 18% of the participants described their local symptoms as severe with 2.8% of them requiring medical consultation but none of them needed hospital admission. Overpenetration, wrong site, and wrong technique may be implicated as possible mechanisms of injection pain [15].\nLymphadenopathy was reported during the clinical trials following the COVID-19 vaccination. In the Pfizer vaccine safety trials, only 0.3% of the recipients reported lymphadenopathy [16], while the AstraZeneca vaccine phase 3 clinical trials did not report any cases of lymphadenopathy [17]. In our study, local lymphadenopathy after COVID-19 vaccines were reported by nearly 2% of the participants who received either the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccine with a slightly higher rate in the Pfizer vaccine while no lymph node enlargement was reported in those who received mixed vaccines.\nCohen et al. reported lymphadenopathy in 45.6% of the participants [18]. while McMurry et al. reported a significantly lower rate of lymphadenopathy in the vaccinated group compared to the non-vaccinated control group [19]. These contradictory results may be due to the selection process of the participants and the nature of the study.\nConcerning the type of vaccine, fever was more common in those who received mixed types of vaccines followed by the AstraZeneca vaccine while rigors, palpitation, and dyspnea were only reported in the Pfizer vaccine recipients. Our findings are in line with the Com-COV study which found that fever was more prevalent in those who received the mixed vaccines compared with participants who received two doses of the same vaccine (34% and 10%, respectively) [20]. Another study in Saudi Arabia found that a mixed vaccination approach was associated with more side effects than the matched vaccination approach [9]. Other systemic manifestations including nausea and vomiting were only experienced in AstraZeneca vaccine recipients.\nImmunologically mediated allergic reactions can cause various manifestations ranging from skin disorders to life-threatening systemic reactions [21]. In this study, only 45 individuals (3.5%) reported allergic manifestations, but three persons reported severe allergic reactions that needed hospital admission. Allergic reactions to vaccines are commonly due to the components of vaccines or attached elements like egg protein and gelatin. The Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine included two new lipid nanoparticles, one is polyethylene glycol with a molecular weight of 2,000 Da (PEG2000) which is reported to cause allergic reactions in some studies [22]. The international consensus didn't recommend routine skin tests with COVID-19 vaccines for the purpose of vaccine withholding, they claimed that the sensitivity of skin tests in predicting serious hypersensitivity reactions to COVID-19 vaccines is unclear [23]. While past histories of allergies were noted to have a higher risk of allergies to vaccines, in our study, a history of allergies was not a risk factor for allergic reactions post-COVID-19 vaccination [24].\nUncommon side effects were also reported in this study, 16 diabetic patients suffered from increased blood sugar levels that required higher doses of the anti-diabetic drugs and nine of them described symptoms constant with neuropathy after vaccination. Safavi et al. identified 23 patients with new-onset neuropathic symptoms following COVID vaccination, one of them was vaccinated by AstraZeneca and 12 received the Pfizer vaccine [25].\nMost of the cross-sectional studies reported menstrual abnormalities in a significant number of women up to 50% after the COVID-19 vaccine. Nonetheless, they were unable to report the causal relationship between menstrual irregularities and COVID-19 vaccination [26]. In this study, menstrual irregularities were identified in 305 women (35.2%), these irregularities extended up to four months after vaccination.\nIn contrast to our study, a retrospective survey in Saudi Arabia reported a low incidence of menstrual abnormalities following COVID-19 vaccination, they hypothesized that platelet disorders or possible hormonal disturbances could be the cause for these abnormalities [27]. Sleep disorder was one of the most frequently reported adverse events in our study, with up to 29.3% of cases complaining of sleepiness following COVID-19 vaccination. Garrido-Su\u00e1rez et al. proposed that COVID-19 vaccines may stimulate the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines that activate GABAergic neurons providing an inhibitory effect on orexinergic neurons [28]. These reported uncommon side effects should be considered in pharmacovigilance future research to understand the potential mechanisms of these side effects and to preserve confidence in these novel vaccines.\n2023 Mohammed et al. Cureus 15(1): e34030. DOI 10.7759/cureus.34030 8 of 10\nThe strength of this study is the comparison of the adverse effects between homologous COVID-19 vaccine regimens with heterologous combinations. The main limitations of this study are the self-reported adverse events and a cross-sectional design that doesn\u2019t allow for causality interpretation. Another limitation is the lack of information regarding the history of SARS-CoV-2 infection, which could be another risk factor for developing adverse effects. Further cohort studies on a large scale are recommended to compare the side effects of a group receiving matched doses and a group receiving mixed doses of COVID-19 vaccines. Additionally, the study evaluated short-term adverse events. Therefore, further cohort studies are recommended to investigate the long-term adverse events following the administration of these COVID-19 vaccines."
