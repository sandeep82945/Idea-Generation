    "abstractText": "Both in terrestrial and extraterrestrial environments, the precise and informative model of the ground and the surface ahead is crucial for navigation and obstacle avoidance. The ground surface is not always flat and in bumpy and rough scenes the functional relationship of the surface-related features may vary in different areas of the ground, and the measured point cloud of the ground does not bear smoothness. Thus, the ground-related features must be obtained based on local estimates or even point estimates. In this paper, a segment-wise GP-based ground segmentation method with local smoothness estimation is proposed. The value of the length-scale is estimated locally for each data point which makes it much more precise for the rough scenes while being not computationally complex and more robust to under-segmentation, sparsity, and underrepresent-ability issues. The segment-wise task is performed to estimate a partial continuous model of the ground for each radial range segment. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed method to give a continuous and precise estimation of the ground surface in rough and bumpy scenes while being fast enough for real-time applications.",

INTRODUCTION\nIn recent years there is an increased demand for different kinds of Unmanned Ground vehicles (UGVs), performing different tasks in a wide variety of applications. These increasing demands have given birth to various three-dimensional perception methods tailored for different conditions and task scenarios aiming at semantic aspects of the matter [1], [2]. The three-dimensional Light Detection and Ranging Sensor (LiDAR) has been extensively deployed for this purpose for its centimeter-level accuracy while being capable of measuring greater distances in comparison with cameras. Furthermore, LiDAR boasts multi-directional sensing ability [3], [4]. The captured three-dimensional point cloud from the LiDAR sensor is utilized for three main tasks: Tracking, Detection and Semantic Segmentation. This paper is centered on the ground segmentation task which is part of semantic segmentation. The ground segmentation task is often performed for two main goals: navigation and semantic classification. In the navigation mode, the algorithm tries to find the navigable areas to assist the UGV [5], [6] while in the semantic mode, the algorithm tries to precept neighboring objects to be able to track or avoid them.\nA precise ground segmentation not only will lead to a more precise object detection by methods like Euclidean clustering [7] but also will reduce the computational cost of the further semantic segmentation tasks [8]. While being a necessary part of any perception module of UGVs, the ground segmentation methods still must deal with major challenges to be resolved.\nEvery UGV maneuvering on the terrestrial surface inevitably encounters the ground. On flat surfaces, the ground may be easily estimated by filtering the point cloud using a height threshold or algorithms like RANSAC [9] or [10] which are simple plane fitting algorithms. While these methods are efficient to be performed for navigational goals in flat urban scenarios, they fail to be applicable where there exists a partially steep slope, bumpy sections, or a rough plateau in the navigable area. Furthermore, if applied for the perception goal they will cause under-segmentation in the final results [11] where points related to the sloped or rough areas of the ground surface are taken into account as outliers or incorrectly merged with other objects.\nAnother challenge of the ground segmentation task is the sparsity of the data. As most of LiDAR\u2019s data is concentrated at near-origin locations, the data gets sparse at longer distances to the origin. Thus, the right ground plane is hard to be estimated at these locations. Available methods tend to neglect the sparse data and just estimate the ground for the nearorigin locations which are insufficient for the perceptional goals. The same issue happens for the near-origin parts of the data while the ground plane\u2019s structure is far more complex to be estimated by partial or segment-wise methods, making the ground plane estimation methods bad representatives of the real ground plane.\nOn the other hand, standard GP lacks the ability to adapt to the variable smoothness of the data. Thus, the input-dependent smoothness may not be taken into account by using the standard GP while they are essential in many applications such as ground segmentation. This arises from the fact that discontinuity and sudden changes in data density may happen in LiDAR\u2019s data, thus a regression method that is able to maintain its adaptivity to local features of the data has merit when compared with other methods. Different Methods have been proposed to estimate the structure of non-stationary covariance functions [12]. The local smoothness can be modeled by a latent process and estimated using Markov Chain Monte\n978-1-6654-2094-5/21/$31.00 \u00a92021 IEEE\nCarlo approaches [13], [14]. Furthermore, some methods tend to obtain mean value estimates of the kernels [15], [16].\nIn Gaussian process-based ground segmentation the role of the length-scale value selection is shown to have a great impact on how the algorithm is able to predict the ground precisely [17], [18]. For the ground segmentation task [19] proposes a functional relationship of the form L = f(r) to relate the length scales to the input location. This is not sufficient because in non-flat grounds the functional relationship will not hold equitable for different regions of the ground. [20] assumes that length scales are a function of line features in different segments. This is not sufficient because no physical background is considered for the selection of functional relationships and this function might change and fail to describe the underlying data in different locations. [17] tends to obtain physically motivated length-scale values by segmenting the point cloud into areas with probable common slopes using the notation of critical points.\nNone of the methods above gives an exact mathematical framework to incorporate local characteristics of LiDAR\u2018s non-smooth data. In this paper, a novel segment-wise method is proposed that estimates the continuous ground plane in a single segment using point estimates of smoothness. The input-dependent smoothness of the process is modeled using a latent stochastic process. Point estimates are obtained using the mean value prediction of the latent variables. The latent variables are assumed to be Gaussian distributed. Thus, point estimates of length-scale values at each particular ground candidate location are calculated using Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) estimate of the latent variable. The gradient-based optimization is utilized to perform the maximization task. Modeling the input-smoothness of the data enables the method to locally adjust the regression model to the ground structure in a point-wise matter. This makes the method robust to under-segmentation as the regression task is adaptive to the local behavior of the elevation data. Furtherly, this makes the method robust to the sparsity issue by relying the height estimation on the point-wise characteristics in sections that there are few points to rely on.\nFurthermore, a pseudo-input selection algorithm is proposed to construct the support value set D\u0304 = (l\u0304 \u2208 L\u0304, r\u0304 \u2208 R\u0304) by collecting points from each line-segments that are dividing the segment into different ranges based on local physical traits [17]. The pseudo-input selection process divides the area into different segments with different structures. Thus, in the near-origin location in which more complexity is present in the data, there would be more line segments. Thus, true representatives of the segments are chosen, making the method robust to the representability issue.\nMoreover, since for most UGV applications such as driverless cars or most Autonomous Land Vehicle (ALVs), the behavior of the ground ahead is of greater importance than in other areas, the proposed method can be used in a singlesegment setting to only estimate the ground ahead of the vehicle precisely and fast. The width of the area that segments include can be altered as a parameter of navigation strategy."

The Predictive distribution of Equation (4) enables the prediction of z\u2217 value at arbitrary locations r\u2217 at each point cloud frame.

As the critical points divide the segment into different successive bins with the same elevation behavior, the support values are chosen from these sets of bins in each line segment.
