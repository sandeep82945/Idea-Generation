"Future research should focus on further enhancing the robustness of the dynamic PCR models to process operating condition variations. Additionally, exploring the integration of other advanced control strategies with inferential control schemes could provide new insights into improving distillation column performance. Investigating the application of the proposed inferential ADRC control method to real industrial distillation columns under various operating conditions would also be valuable to validate its effectiveness and adaptability in practical scenarios."
