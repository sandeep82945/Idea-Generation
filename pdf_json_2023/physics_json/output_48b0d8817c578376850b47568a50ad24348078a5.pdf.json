Here, based\non a DFT exploration at a carefully selected level of theory, we have compiled a list of the optoelectronic\nproperties of ID1\u2013ID7 and IDR. In light of these results, all newly designed molecules, except ID5 have\nshown a bathochromic shift in their highest absorbance (lmax). ID1\u2013ID4, ID6 and ID7 molecules have smaller band gap (Egap) and excitation energy (Ex). IP of ID5 is the smallest and EA of ID1 is the largest among all others. Compared to the parent molecule, ID1\u2013ID3 have increased electron mobility, with ID1\nbeing the most improved in hole mobility. ID4 had the best light harvesting efficiency in this\ninvestigation, due to its strongest oscillator. The acceptor molecules' open-circuit voltages (VOC) were computed after being linked to the PTB7-Th donor molecule. Fill factor (FF) and normalized VOC of ID1\u2013 ID7 were calculated and compared to the parent molecule. Based on the outcomes of this study, the\nmodified acceptors may be further scrutinised for empirical usage in the production of organic solar\ncells with enhanced photovoltaic capabilities."

The maximum absorption (lmax) of ITIC is 664 nm in dichloromethane, while the compound shows considerable absorption from 500 to 750 nm. The ITIC lm has an optical bandgap of 1.59 eV, while its electron mobility may reach to 3.0 \u00d7 10\u22124 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121.26 Contrarily, lmax of IDIC is seen about 640 nm, with substantial absorption observed between 500 and\nRSC Adv., 2023, 13, 4641\u20134655 | 4641\nO pe\nn A\ncc es\ns A\nrt ic\nle .

The optical bandgap of IDIC is 1.60 eV, and its electron mobility is very high i.e., 1.1 \u00d7 10\u22123 cm2 V\u22121 s\u22121.27,28 Though when blended with PDCBT-Cl, its maximum output voltage (0.94 V) and ll factor (64.2%) values are slightly lower to the ITIC (1.01 V and 64.8%), but its PCE of 9.12% is quite higher to the 7.05% of ITIC, which could be due to its higher short circuit current value of 15.0 mA cm\u22122 compared to the 10.6 mA cm\u22122 of its counterpart.29 In contrast to ITIC, IDIC has alkyl side groups on its IDT centre, a small fused ring in its central entity, and so has the capability to be the least priced acceptor. Furthermore, the stated technique for the production of ITIC requires a difficult multiple steps procedure with tedious post-production,30 e.g. the Wolff\u2013 Kishner reduction reaction and Friedel\u2013Cras acylation reaction. As a consequence, the productivity is poor, and the costing is expensive. In contrast, the alkylation of ring-closure employed in IDIC synthesizing process may have a poor yield of the core fused-ring group because of the adverse reaction of alkyl chain dehydration. A more effective strategy for preparing the n-OS acceptors with alkyl side-groups was, hence, required.\nAmberlyst15, a catalyst employed in the synthesis of IDIC's core fused ring, was described by Li et al. as a means of simplifying and optimizing the synthesis process, with potential cost savings for the nal product.31 Following this, they generated a fused-ring entity MO-IDT and enhanced the production of the core fused-ring component by adding alkoxy (\u2013OR) groups to it. Using MO-IDT as a building block, the inexpensive acceptor MO-IDIC was synthesized, and its photovoltaic characteristics were studied in depth. The observed absorption spectra revealed that MO-IDIC have a potential absorption of 600\u2013700 nm along with a maximum absorption at 670 nm. There was a signicant PCE increase (11.16%) in PTQ10-donor MO-IDIC-acceptor PSCs. According to the ndings, MO-IDIC shows promise as a low-priced n-OS acceptor for potential PSC applications in the future.31\nIn the present research, we have usedMO-IDIC as a reference molecule (IDR) and have replaced lengthy alkyl chains with methyl groups, for the sake of saving time and effort, because the existence of long alkyl chains do not impose any considerable impact on the optoelectronic features of the molecules.32,33 The electron donor core of IDR is dimethoxyl-indaceno dithiophene based and 2-(2-methylene-3-oxo-indan-1-ylidene)malononitrile is the end-group (EG) existing on the both peripheral sites of the core. Seven new acceptors (ID1\u2013ID7) have been developed computationally by replacing the exiting EGs of IDR with 1-dicyanomethylene-2-methylene-3-oxo-indan-5,6dicarbonitrile in ID1, 1-dicyanomethylene-2-methylene-3-oxoindan-5,6-dicarboxylic acid dimethyl ester in ID2, 6-cyano-1dicyanomethylene-2-methylene-3-oxo-indan-5-carboxylic acid methyl ester in ID3, 2-(3-chloro-5-methylene-6-oxo-5,6-dihydrocyclopenta[c]thiophen-4-ylidene)-malononitrile in ID4, 5,6- diuoro-2-methylene-3-(2,2,2-triuoro-1-triuoromethylethylidene)-indan-1-one in ID5, 5,6-dichloro-3dinitromethylene-2-methylene-indan-1-one in ID6, and (5,6- diuoro-2-methylene-3-oxo-indan-1-ylidene)-methanedisulfon ic acid in ID7 correspondingly, as shown in Fig. 1.\n4642 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 4641\u20134655"

The molecules, including the reference, were devised using the GaussView 6.0.16.35 For the purpose of IDR optimization, density functional theory (DFT) computations are done run using 6-31G(d,p) basis set with B3LYP,36 CAM-B3LYP,37 MPW1PW91,38 and wB97XD39 functionals. Aer IDR's structure was optimized, we used time-dependent DFT simulations to predict its light-absorbing characteristics. We investigated the effect of the solvent (chloroform) on these characteristics using the IEFPCM approach.40 The theoretical technique was validated by contrasting the theoretically predicted maximum absorption (lmax) of IDR from the preceding four functionals to empirically observed lmax data from the research. A comparison is made between the empirical max of IDR (670 nm)31 and the four predicted lmax i.e. 656 nm, 624 nm, 519 nm, and 537 nm (Fig. 2). To get the best appropriate ndings for the computationally created compounds, we found that simulations using the B3LYP functional were the most closest in accord with the empirical observations.\nOrigin 6.0 was used to generate the proles of the compounds' absorption.41 We studied the transition density matrix (TDM) and utilized Multiwfn42 to examine the paths and interactions of excitons. PyMOlyze 1.1 (ref. 43) was used in order to produce graphs illustrating the density of states (DOS).44 In order to compute the intramolecular and intermolecular mobility of charges, the Marcus theory has been used, and the reorganization energy (RE) was investigated.45,46 However, intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) is what we focused on for this investigation. RE refers to the interplay of two distinct but linked reorganization energies. Exterior RE is affected by intense environmental oscillations and polarity uctuations that occur while the charge transfer, internal RE is mostly reliant on differences in molecule structure.47 For this investigation, we can only focus on internal RE since we cannot use external RE to verify our estimations. Using eqn (1) and (2),48 we calculated the RE for hole (l+) and electron (l\u2212) mobility.\nl+ = [E+ 0 \u2212 E0] + [E0+ \u2212 E+] (1)\nl\u2212 = [E\u2212 0 \u2212 E0] + [E0\u2212 \u2212 E\u2212] (2)\nE+ 0 and E\u2212 0 signies the neutral energies of the molecules generated from the optimal form of cation and anions. Anion and cation energies, E0 \u2212 and E0 + are calculated from the ground state optimization of the neutral molecule. Computed anion and cation energy estimated from the respective anion and cation optimized geometry. E0 is the energy of a molecule's neutrally optimized ground state.49"

            "text": "It is critical to examine the FMOs since doing so exposes how well the molecules facilitate charge transit and electric potential dispersion.54 It aids in understanding how charge is transferred and promoted around OSCs. Conduction mechanism, absorptivity, and other electrical characteristics of molecules are dramatically affected by their HOMO and LUMO energies. When discussing OSCs and other photovoltaic processes, it is important to note the presence of the energy gap (Egap), which reects the proportion of energy needed for the excitation of electrons.55 It is seen that molecules with low band gap generally produce low values of open-circuit voltage, but absorb greater sunlight and thus produces increased amount of current, and vice versa. So, the band gap should be in an optimal range for the molecule to generate effective photovoltaic attributes of all the studied parameters.56 Extremely polarizable, fragile reaction kinetics, and highly reactive molecules have a low Egap.57 The calculated FMOs and Egap energies of the IDR and ID1\u2013ID7 molecules are analyzed to estimate the effect of several electron accepting EGs on the photochemical aspects of the molecules under consideration (Table 2). Fig. 4 displays the HOMO and LUMO energies, as well as the Egap, for each molecule.\nMost of a molecule's charge in its ground state is found in its core region, which is called the donor region. The EG accepting subunits are the most peripheral parts of a molecule that receive charges when the molecule is in an excited state. The planarity of molecular structures allow for signicant charge transport functions, and charge mobility features of compounds from donor to acceptor locations is proof of this effective conjugation. The IDR compound has a HOMO, LUMO, and Egap of \u22125.68, \u22123.44, and 2.24 eV. The ID1 molecule has the highly-stable HOMO of all the compounds tested, with a value of \u22126.25 eV for its HOMO. ID1's electrostatic\n4644 | RSC Adv., 2023, 13, 4641\u20134655\npotential dispersion, which has made the ground-state extremely stable, is most likely due to electron-withdrawing cyano groups in the molecule's EG units. ID3 possesses highly-stable HOMO aer ID1, and its comparatively low HOMO of \u22126.08 eV is the reason for this. The electronegative ester and cyano groups in the EG of ID3 is the most probable reason behind its second stables HOMO. The declining patterns of examined compounds' HOMO and LUMO orbiting energy values are ID5 > IDR > ID4 > ID2 > ID7 > ID6 > ID3 > ID1 and ID5 > IDR > ID4 > ID2 > ID7 > ID6 > ID3 > ID1, respectively. The Egap of every recently proposed molecule has decreased as compared to IDR molecule, with the exception of ID5. As a result of the strong electronegative EGs, the Egap is shrunk, which improves the molecule's charge transfer capacities. ID5 > IDR > ID7 > ID2 > ID3= ID4 > ID1 > ID6 is the declining trend of Egap for all studied compounds."

As a consequence, the crystalline character of the compound is enhanced, and it becomesmore soluble in polar-solvents due to the tight packing of its structural components. Higher D numbers indicate that molecules are more prone to crystallize, and that they disperse more easily in polar liquids, both of which enhance charge transmission.66 Molecules with negligible D value are oen not soluble in polar aprotic solvents like CHCl3. This correlation is not, however, always true since the molecular structure of a given molecule determines its reactivity toward solvents and its ability to transmit charges.63 Table 4 exhibit numerical data indicating an escalating order of D for molecules i.e. IDR < ID6 < ID1 < ID5 < ID7 < ID2 < ID4 < ID3 and IDR < ID1 < ID6 < ID5 < ID7 < ID2 < ID4 < ID3 studied in both stages (gas and CHCl3 respectively).

From Fig. 4, it can be concluded that these observations agree with the FMOs of the investigated compounds.

ESP diagrams include dark red spots representing regions of high electron density around oxygen and nitrogen atoms at the EGs of molecules (Fig. 7). Because oxygen is present at EGs, its characteristic red hue serves as an indicator of the high electron density present across these spots. However, oxygen is present in the centre of molecules displaying blue and green hues, and the electrons decient carbon atoms nearby cancels out the electrostatic concentration of the oxygen there.46 On the ESP maps, methyl and benzene and thiophene rings are shaded blue to indicate a signicant deciency of electrons.\n3.9.

            "text": "In this study, seven small acceptor-molecules (ID1\u2013ID7) were computationally designed to optimize OSC performance by modifying the reference molecule's (IDR) EG acceptor. Our calculations of the new compounds' optoelectronic properties, using the B3LYP/6-31G(d,p) level of theory, are equated to those of the original molecule. The Egap of every recently proposed molecule has decreased (2.11\u20132.23 eV) as opposed to IDR (2.24 eV), with the exception of ID5 (2.37 eV). The ID1 has the largest EA (3.37 eV) and ID5 possesses the smallest IP (6.25 eV) in this study. Except ID5, all newly designed molecules have bathochromic shi in their lmax. The lmax of ID1\u2013ID4, ID6 and ID7 molecules are 702 nm, 673 nm, 685 nm, 673 nm, 725 nm and 675 nm, respectively. LHE of ID2 and ID4molecules were better than IDR. ID1\u2013ID7 have much higher dipole moment values than IDR, which improves their solubility and crystallinity. ID1\u2013 ID3, with their lower RE of l\u2212 (0.1469, 0.1061, and 0.1850 eV), have higher electron mobility than IDR (0.1986 eV). Remarkably, ID1 (0.1687 eV) has the greatest hole mobility of all the studied molecules since its RE for hole mobility has decreased the most. In the present work, the HOMO of PTB7-Th donor was coupled with the LUMO of the studied NFAs (IDR, ID1\u2013ID7) to produce the maximum and ID5 molecules have a higher VOC value (1.67 eV) than IDR molecules do (1.46 eV). These ndings suggest that the changed molecules deserve additional research as a means to develop OSC with improved photovoltaic performance.\nConflicts of interest\nThe authors declare no conict of interest."
