1. **Investigate the impact of different OE constraints on the performance of the proposed market mechanism.** The paper assumes that the OEs are imposed exogenously by the DSO, but it would be interesting to explore how the mechanism would perform under different OE constraints, such as those imposed by the grid operator or by the community itself.
2. **Develop a more sophisticated model of the community manager's decision-making process.** The paper assumes that the community manager is a benevolent actor who maximizes the community's social welfare. However, in practice, the community manager may have other objectives, such as maximizing their own profit or minimizing the risk of community members leaving the community. Developing a more sophisticated model of the community manager's decision-making process would help to better understand the behavior of the proposed market mechanism.
3. **Explore the use of the proposed market mechanism in different types of energy communities.** The paper focuses on the use of the proposed market mechanism in a residential energy community. However, the mechanism could also be applied to other types of energy communities, such as commercial or industrial energy communities. Exploring the use of the proposed market mechanism in different types of energy communities would help to identify its strengths and weaknesses.
4. **Develop a pilot program to test the proposed market mechanism in a real-world setting.** The paper presents a theoretical model of the proposed market mechanism, but it would be valuable to test the mechanism in a real-world setting. Developing a pilot program to test the proposed market mechanism would help to validate the model and identify any potential challenges to its implementation.
5. **Investigate the potential for the proposed market mechanism to be used to support the integration of distributed energy resources into the grid.** The proposed market mechanism could be used to support the integration of distributed energy resources into the grid by providing a way for community members to share the benefits of renewable energy generation. Investigating the potential for the proposed market mechanism to be used to support the integration of distributed energy resources into the grid would help to promote the adoption of renewable energy and reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
