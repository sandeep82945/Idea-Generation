    "abstractText": "In this paper, we propose a high resolution time-frequency (TF) analysis method called Newton time-extracting wavelet transform (NTEWT), which is designed to analyze frequency-varying signals with fast varying group delay (GD). Firstly, we discuss the relationship among the fixed points of time reassignment operator, the ridge points of wavelet transform and GD of the signal. Combining the above relations and Newton algorithm, we propose a Newton GD estimator. By only retaining the TF information most related to frequency-varying features of the signal and removing the weakly-related TF coefficients, we further introduce the NTEWT, which can not only achieve a more concentrated TF representation, but also enable signal reconstruction. Meanwhile, we develop a theoretical analysis of NTEWT under the mathematical framework. Firstly, we introduce a precise mathematical definition of a class of weakly-separated frequency-varying chirp-like components, and we prove that Newton GD estimator can accurately estimate GD of arbitrary function in this class, and NTEWT does indeed succeed in decomposing these functions. Finally, we use numerical experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed NTEWT in terms of TF concentration, GD estimation and signal reconstruction.",

            "text": "In this paper, we propose a high resolution time-frequency (TF) analysis method called Newton time-extracting wavelet transform (NTEWT), which is designed to analyze frequency-varying signals with fast varying group delay (GD). Firstly, we discuss the relationship among the fixed points of time reassignment operator, the ridge points of wavelet transform and GD of the signal. Combining the above relations and Newton algorithm, we propose a Newton GD estimator. By only retaining the TF information most related to frequency-varying features of the signal and removing the weakly-related TF coefficients, we further introduce the NTEWT, which can not only achieve a more concentrated TF representation, but also enable signal reconstruction. Meanwhile, we develop a theoretical analysis of NTEWT under the mathematical framework. Firstly, we introduce a precise mathematical definition of a class of weakly-separated frequency-varying chirp-like components, and we prove that Newton GD estimator can accurately estimate GD of arbitrary function in this class, and NTEWT does indeed succeed in decomposing these functions. Finally, we use numerical experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed NTEWT in terms of TF concentration, GD estimation and signal reconstruction.\nKeywords: Time-frequency analysis, Time reassignment operator, Group delay, Ridge, Newton time-extracting wavelet transform, Signal reconstruction"

Many effective TFA methods mainly include linear TFA methods, nonlinear TFA methods and bilinear TFA methods. Linear TFA methods, such as the short-time Fourier transform (STFT) [8] and the wavelet transform\n\u2217Corresponding author. Email address: zszhang@mail.xjtu.edu.cn (Zhuosheng Zhang)\nPreprint submitted to Signal Processing February 18, 2023\n(WT) [9], calculate the inner product between the signal and the basis function to characterize the TF structure of signal. Generally, the better the basis function matches the signal, the more suitable it is to characterize TF features with concentrated energy. Nonlinear TFA methods aim to construct new basis functions to characterize the non-linearity of signals, such as linear chirplet transform [10], local polynomial transform [11], and matched demodulation transform [12], etc. However, restricted by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, linear and nonlinear TFA methods often generate blurry TFRs, and they had difficulty providing accurate TF descriptions for signals. Besides, bilinear TFA methods, such as the Wigner-Ville distribution [1] and its variants, which can effectively improve the TF resolution of mono-component signals, but introduce interference terms for multi-component signals and thus reduce the readability of the TFRs. In order to overcome these shortcomings, some advanced methods have been proposed successively.\nThe reassignment method (RM), proposed by Kodera et al. to the spectrogram [13, 14], and generalized by Auger and Flandrin to any bilinear time-frequency or time-scale distribution [15], is an old but under-explored method [16, 17, 18]. In parallel, Daubechies and Maes proposed the synchrosqueezing wavelet transform (SWT) [19] based on a phase technique to analyse auditory signals, which is a special case of the RM. And Huang et al. introduced an empirical mode decomposition (EMD) [20] to decompose the signal into a series of intrinsic mode functions in a data-driven manner. Though attractive because of its effectiveness and simplicity [21, 22], EMD lacks solid mathematical foundations. In this context, SWT has resurfaced as an alternative theoretical way to understand the principle of EMD with a convenient mathematical framework [23]. RM has, in turn, received new attention [24-26]. Although the RM relocates TF energy aiming to sharpen the TFR, and employs instantaneous frequency (IF) and group delay (GD) estimators, it is not invertible unfortunately. While SWT can reconstruct the interesting signals but suffers from blurred TFRs for signals with fast varying IF. Furthermore, new extensions of SWT have been developed [7, 27-32], among these improved methods, recently synchroextracting transform (SET) [32] has attracted great attention. Differing from the squeezing manner of SWT, SET only utilizes a small number of TF coefficients, but achieves a more concentrated TFR. Similar to SWT, SET also develops the corresponding higher-order extensions [33-35].\nOn the one hand, based on different features of signals, signals are divided into time-varying signals and frequency-varying signals. The TF energy distribution of time-varying signals spread around the IF trajectory, which can help to better identify the variation law of time-varying signals along the time direction, while the TF energy distribution of frequency-varying signals spread around the GD trajectory, which can effectively reflect the variation law of frequency-varying signals along the frequency direction. On the other hand, according to different direction of post-processing, TFA post-processing methods are divided into three categories. The first class considers both time and frequency directions, such as reassigned scalogram (RS), although RS can improve both the time resolution and the frequency/scale resolution of the TFR, unfortunately, it cannot reconstruct the signal. The second class considers only\nfrequency direction, such as SWT [23], matching synchrosqueezing wavelet transform (MSWT) [7], SET [32] and self-matched extracting wavelet transform (SMEWT) [34]. These TFA methods can reconstruct signals, and they are more suitable for characterizing slowly or strongly time-varying signals, but they may be no longer applicable for characterizing frequency-varying signals. In order to accurately analyze frequency varying signals, the third class of TFA post-processing along the time direction have emerged, including the time-reassigned synchrosqueezing transform (TSST) [36] and transient-extracting transform (TET) [37], and our recently proposed time-reassigned synchrosqueezing wavelet transform (TSWT) [38] and time-extracting wavelet transform (TEWT) [39], where we provide rigorous theoretical analysis of TSWT and TEWT for frequency-varying signals under the mathematical framework. Moreover, secondorder TSST (TSST2) [40, 41] and second-order TET [42, 43] have been proposed. Indeed, these TFA methods reassigning or extracting along the time direction can reconstruct signals and are suitable for characterizing slowly or strongly frequency-varying signals.\nIt can be concluded that one of the advantages of TET/TEWT is to extract the TF coefficients of the fixed points of time reassignment operator, because the time reassignment operator can accurately estimate the GD of impulsive signal, and the fixed points of time reassignment operator are equivalent to ridge points of WT, where ridge is the most relevant to the TF features of signals. Therefore, for more general signals, the relationship among the fixed points of the time reassignment operator, ridge points of the WT and GD of signals is particularly important. In this paper, we discuss the relationship among these three, and develop a new GD estimator for strongly frequency-varying signal, which can precisely describe the ridge of WT and accurately estimate the GD of signal. Further we introduce a new frequency-varying TFA method and develop the rigorous theoretical analysis. The main innovations of this paper are:\ni) We convert the GD estimation problem into solving the fixed point problem and propose a new GD estimator. We firstly develop a strict equivalence condition between the fixed points of the time reassignment operator and ridge points of WT, and further discuss the relationship among the fixed points of the time reassignment operator, ridge points of the WT and GD of a frequency-varying linear chirp signal. Then, combining these relations with Newton algorithm, we propose a Newton GD estimator, which not only accurately estimates the GD of the signal, but also accurately describes the ridge of WT.\nii) Based on the proposed Newton GD estimator, we propose a Newton time-extracting wavelet transform (NTEWT), which can generate a highly concentrated TFR and reconstruct signal. The main idea of NTEWT is to retain the TF information that are most related to the frequency-varying features of the signal and to remove the weakly-related TF coefficients.\niii) We define a class of weakly-separated frequency-varying chirp-like components (WFCC), which relaxes the strict well-separated condition between components to some extent. The function class we define includes possible interference components and is applicable to a wider range of practical signals.\niv) For such function class, we provide a theoretical analysis for NTEWT under a strict mathematical\nframework, and prove that the Newton GD estimator indeed successfully estimates the GD and the NTEWT reconstructs the signal with high accuracy.\nThe remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In section 2, we discuss the relationship among the fixed points of the time reassignment operator, ridge points of the WT and GD of the signal. Then in section 3, we combine these relations and Newton algorithm to propose a Newton GD estimator. And further, we introduce the NTEWT. In section 4, we analyze the performance of the NTEWT theoretically, including a theorem and its proof about the NTEWT for a class of WFCC. Section 5 is devoted to the comparative study of the NTEWT and other TFA methods on simulated and real sigals with three quantitative indicators. Finally, conclusions are drawn in section 6."

For any signal X(\u03c9) = A(\u03c9)e\u2212i\u03c6(\u03c9), consider a Morlet wavelet expressed by\n\u03c8\u0302(\u03c9) = (4\u03c0\u03c32) 1 4 e\u2212\n\u03c32(\u03c9\u2212\u03c9\u03c8) 2\n2 , (9)\nthen for any (b, a) \u2208 R\u00d7 R+, the following statements hold:\n(a) t\u0302X(b, a) = b if and only if \u2202b lnM \u03c8\u0302 X(b, a) = 0. (b) If t\u0302X(b, a) is a contraction operator for a given scale a, then t\u0302X(b, a) = b if and only if the point\n(b, a) is a ridge point. Proof. (a) For \u03c8\u0302(\u03c9), since t\u03c8(t) FT\u2212\u2212\u2192 i\u03c8\u0302\u2032 and its derivative \u03c8\u0302\u2032(\u03c9) = \u2212\u03c32(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9\u03c8)\u03c8\u0302(\u03c9), it is easy to derive that by Eq.

On the other hand, noting that \u2202bW \u03c8\u0302X(b, a) = i aW \u03c9\u03c8\u0302 X (b, a), it follows that\n<{\u2202b lnW \u03c8\u0302X(b, a)} = \u2212={ W\u03c9\u03c8\u0302X (b, a)\naW \u03c8\u0302X(b, a) }.

Then, for proving that (b\u2217, a) is\na ridge point, we only need to show \u2202 2 \u2202b2 lnM \u03c8\u0302 X(b \u2217, a) < 0, by Eq.

Since t\u0302X(b, a) is a contraction operator, by Definition 6, there exists a constant k such that 0 < k < 1 and\n|F (bn+1)\u2212 F (bn)| \u2264 k \u00b7 |bn+1 \u2212 bn|, n = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (13)\nThanks to the regularity of the WT, the function F (b) is continuously differentiable, then this follows that there exists a \u03ben being between bn and bn+1, such that\n|F \u2032(\u03ben)| \u2264 k, n = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 (14)\nDue to lim n\u2192+\u221e\nbn = b \u2217, it deduces that |F \u2032(b\u2217)| \u2264 k, that is |\u2202bt\u0302X(b\u2217, a)| \u2264 k < 1. Assume (b, a) is a ridge\npoint, then by (a), we have t\u0302X(b, a) = b. Hence, Theorem 1 (b) holds.\nTheorem 1 well reveals the existence of the fixed points of the time reassignment operator, explains the relationship between the fixed points of the time reassignment operator and ridge points of WT, and provides equivalent condition of the two, i.e. t\u0302x(b, a) is a contraction operator. Since the fixed points of the contraction operator exist and are unique, the ridge points exist and are unique. In the next subsection, we will use a frequency-varying linear chirp signal to verify Theorem 1."

For a frequency-varying linear chirp signal,\nX(\u03c9) = Ae\u2212i\u03c6(\u03c9), (15)\nwhere \u03c6(\u03c9) = \u03b12\u03c9 2 + \u03b2\u03c9 + \u03b3, consider the Morlet wavelet \u03c8\u0302(\u03c9) = (4\u03c0\u03c32) 1 4 e\u2212\n\u03c32(\u03c9\u2212\u03c9\u03c8) 2\n2 .

(d) t\u0302X(b, a) = b if and only if the point (b, a) is a ridge point of WT W \u03c8\u0302 X(b, a).\nProof. (a) Since \u03c9\u03c8 is the frequency center of the Morlet wavelet \u03c8\u0302(\u03c9), the frequency \u03c9 and scale a are related by\n\u03c9 = \u03c9\u03c8 a .

(22)\nHence, by Eq. (22) and the GD expression of signal X(\u03c9) in Eq. (17), one can get immediately that Lemma 1 (c) holds.\n(d) The derivative of lnW \u03c8\u0302X(b, a) with respect to time b is calculated as\n\u2202b lnW \u03c8\u0302 X(b, a) = i \u03c9\u03c8 a \u2212 a 2\u03c32 \u2212 i\u03b1 a4\u03c34 + \u03b12 (b\u2212 \u03b1\u03c9\u03c8 a \u2212 \u03b2).

(25)\nThus, the ridge trajectory of WT W \u03c8\u0302X(b, a) can be written as\nb = \u03b1 \u03c9\u03c8 a + \u03b2, a > 0. (26)\nThis, together with Eq. (22), lead to the conclusion that Lemma 1 (d) holds.\nIt can be concluded from Lemma 1 that for the frequency-varying linear chirp signal X(\u03c9): (1) t\u0302X(b, a) is a biased estimate of the GD of X(\u03c9); (2) the fixed point of time reassignment operator t\u0302X(b, a) is an accurate estimate of the GD; (3) the GD trajectory of signal X(\u03c9) and the ridge trajectory of WT W \u03c8\u0302X(b, a) are the same."

            "text": "As can be seen from the previous section, for the frequency-varying linear chirp signal X(\u03c9), the time reassignment operator t\u0302X(b, a) can\u2019t estimate the GD of X(\u03c9) accurately, but the fixed points of the time reassignment operator can. Indeed, the fixed points of the time reassignment operator can not only accurately estimate the GD of the signal, but also precisely describe the ridge of WT. Therefore, the GD estimation problem is converted into the problem for solving the fixed points of the time reassignment operator, then we can try to employ some root finding algorithms to derive a new GD estimator. Inspired by the relations between Eqs. (17), (19) and (22), we use Newton algorithm to estimate GD in the following.\nLemma 2. For a frequency-varying linear chirp signal,\nX(\u03c9) = Ae\u2212i\u03c6(\u03c9), (27)\nwhere \u03c6(\u03c9) = \u03b12\u03c9 2 + \u03b2\u03c9 + \u03b3, consider the Morlet wavelet \u03c8\u0302(\u03c9) = (4\u03c0\u03c32) 1 4 e\u2212\n\u03c32(\u03c9\u2212\u03c9\u03c8) 2\n2 . Let\nt\u0304X(b, a) = b\u2212 b\u2212 t\u0303X(b, a)\n1\u2212 \u2202bt\u0303X(b, a) . (28)\nThen the following hold:\n(a) t\u0304X(b, a) = b if and only if t\u0303X(b, a) = b. (b) t\u0304X(b, a) is an accurate GD estimation of the signal X(\u03c9). (c) t\u0304X(b, a) = b if and only if the point (b, a) is at the GD trajectory of signal X(\u03c9). (d) t\u0304X(b, a) = b if and only if the point (b, a) is a ridge point of WT W \u03c8\u0302 X(b, a).\nProof. (a) By Eq. (19), we immediately get\n\u2202bt\u0303X(b, a) = 1\u2212 a2\u03c32(a2\u03c32 \u2212 i\u03b1)\na4\u03c34 + \u03b12 , (29)\nit means that we have 1\u2212 \u2202bt\u0303X(b, a) 6= 0. Thus, by Eq. (28), t\u0304X(b, a) = b if and only if t\u0303X(b, a) = b.\n(b) Combining Eq. (19) with Eq. (29), we have\nt\u0303X(b, a) = b\u2212 (1\u2212 \u2202bt\u0303X(b, a))(b\u2212 \u03b1 \u03c9\u03c8 a \u2212 \u03b2).\nThus, for any (b, a) \u2208 R\u00d7 R+, we have\nt\u0304X(b, a) = b\u2212 b\u2212 t\u0303X(b, a)\n1\u2212 \u2202bt\u0303X(b, a) = \u03b1 \u03c9\u03c8 a + \u03b2 = \u03c6\u2032( \u03c9\u03c8 a ). (30)\nthat is, t\u0304X(b, a) is an accurate GD estimation of the signal X(\u03c9).\n(c) According to Eq. (30), one has t\u0304X(b, a) = b if and only if the point (b, a) is at the GD trajectory\nof signal X(\u03c9), i.e.\nb = \u03b1 \u03c9\u03c8 a + \u03b2. (31)\n(d) Combining Eq. (26) with Eq. (30), we have t\u0304X(b, a) = b if and only if the point (b, a) is a ridge\npoint of WT.\nEq. (28) can be considered as the first iteration of the Newton algorithm for solving the fixed point equation t\u0303X(s, a) = s, in which a sequence defined in the scalar case as sn+1 = sn \u2212 f(sn)f \u2032(sn) , is hoped to converge to a root of the equation f(s) = 0, where f(s) = s \u2212 t\u0303X(s, a), with s0 = b. Thus, we have the following definition:\nDefinition 7. A Newton GD (NGD) estimator t\u0304X(b, a) can be defined by\nt\u0304X(b, a) = b\u2212 b\u2212 t\u0303X(b, a)\n1\u2212 \u2202bt\u0303X(b, a) . (32)\nIt is noteworthy that we convert GD estimation problem into solving the fixed point problem, and propose the NGD estimator t\u0304X(b, a) combined with Newton algorithm. It is a new attempt to estimate GD, which also allows to design other GD estimators from other root finding algorithms.\nIt can be found that various IF estimators, presented in [7], [23], [27], [28], [32], [34], are usually suitable for estimating the IF of slowly or strongly time-varying signals, but they aren\u2019t suitable for impulsive signals whose TF ridge curves are nearly perpendicular to the time axis. For analyzing impulsive signals, GD estimation is often more appropriate than IF estimation. The proposed NGD estimator can not only accurately estimate the GD of impulsive signals, but also further estimate the GD of second-order frequency-varying signals. Especially for frequency-varying linear chirp signal X(\u03c9), NGD estimator can accurately estimate the GD of X(\u03c9) and describe the ridge of WT.\nFrom the comparison between those IF estimators and NGD estimator, we found that those IF estimators perform better for estimating the IF of slowly or strongly time-varying signals, while NGD estimator can accurately estimate the GD of slowly or strongly frequency-varying signals. Therefore, NGD estimator and those IF estimators are complementary with each other and each of them has respective scope of application."

            "text": "In this subsection, we extend TEWT to the second-order case based on the Newton GD estimator,\nand propose a new TFA post-processing method extracting along the time direction.\nDefinition 8. The Newton time-extracting wavelet transform (NTEWT) is defined as\nNTe(b, a) = W \u03c8\u0302X(b, a) \u00b7 \u03b4(b\u2212 t\u0304X(b, a)). (33)\nIt is well known that SWT [23] is designed for local harmonic signal in the time domain, MSWT [7] is designed for local constant amplitude-modulated linear chirp signal in the time domain, and SMEWT [34] is designed for local Gaussian amplitude-modulated linear chirp in the time domain. Thus, these TFA methods reassigning or extracting along the frequency direction are suitable for dealing with slowly or strongly varying signals in the time domain. However, the TSST [36], TSWT [38] and TEWT [39] are suitable for impulsive-like signals, and the proposed NTEWT is designed for frequency-varying linear chirp signal. Therefore, these TFA methods reassigning or extracting along the time direction are suitable for characterizing slowly or strongly varying signals in the frequency domain.\nDiffering from the squeezing manner of synchrosqueezing methods [7], [23], [27], [36], [38], [40], the NTEWT only extracts the WT coefficients at the fixed point trajectory b = t\u0304X(b, a), while removing the TF coefficients beyond the fixed point trajectory b = t\u0304X(b, a). In particular, for the frequency-varying linear chirp signal X(\u03c9), it can be concluded from the above discussion that: (1) by Lemma 2 (c), the NTEWT exactly extracts the WT coefficients at the GD trajectory of signal; (2) as shown in Lemma 2 (d), the fixed points of the NGD estimator t\u0304X(b, a) are the time ridge points, which means that NTEWT can remain the maximum energy of the WT modulus, then NTEWT can obtain a more energy concentrated TFR; (3) According to Eq. (18), NTEWT maintains the reconstructed property of WT, and signal X(\u03c9) can be recovered by WT along the GD trajectory, i.e.,\nX( \u03c9\u03c8 a ) = aW\u03c8x (\u03c6 \u2032( \u03c9\u03c8 a ), a)e\n\u2212i \u03c9\u03c8 a b\nCx(\u03c6\u2032( \u03c9\u03c8 a , a)\n. (34)\nIt motivates us to recover signal X(\u03c9) from the NTEWT with a similar reconstruction expression:\nX( \u03c9\u03c8 a\n) = aNTe(\u03c6\u2032( \u03c9\u03c8 a ), a)e\n\u2212i \u03c9\u03c8 a b\nCx(\u03c6\u2032( \u03c9\u03c8 a , a)\n.

            "text": "In this section, we will provide a rigorous theoretical analysis of NTEWT that can identify and characterize a function class C ,d. To better understand the function class C ,d for NTEWT, let\u2019s first review a function class H ,d for TSWT.\nDefinition 9. [38] The class H ,d is said to be a set of all superposition of well-separated frequencydomain harmonic-like functions, with accuracy > 0 and separation d > 0, if each element X(\u03c9) =\nK\u2211 k=1 Xk(\u03c9) = K\u2211 k=1 Ak(\u03c9)e \u2212i\u03c6k(\u03c9) \u2208 L\u221e(R), with Ak(\u03c9) \u2208 C1(R) \u2229 L\u221e(R) and \u03c6k(\u03c9) \u2208 C2(R) satisfying:\nmk = sup \u03c9\u2208R+ |Ak(\u03c9)|, m\u2032k = sup \u03c9\u2208R+ |\u03c6\u2032k(\u03c9)|, |A\u2032k(\u03c9)|, |\u03c6\u2032\u2032k(\u03c9)| \u2264 |\u03c6\u2032k(\u03c9)|, \u2200\u03c9 \u2208 R+, \u03c6\u2032k+1(\u03c9)\u2212 \u03c6\u2032k(\u03c9) \u2265 d\n\u03c9 , \u2200\u03c9 \u2208 R+, k \u2208 {1, 2, ...,K \u2212 1}.\n(36)\nIntuitively, for the function class H ,d, each component Xk(\u03c9) can be viewed as approximately a harmonic signal locally in the frequency domain, with slowly varying amplitude Ak(\u03c9) and GD \u03c6 \u2032 k(\u03c9). In Theorem 3.1 for the TSWT [38], it has been shown that Xk(\u03c9) and Xk+1(\u03c9) satisfying well-separated conditions ( \u03c6\u2032k+1(\u03c9)\u2212\u03c6\u2032k(\u03c9) \u2265 d\u03c9 with d > 2\u03c9\u03c8\u2206) are separated. It has been also proven that the energy of WT W \u03c8\u0302Xk(b, a) of the kth component Xk(\u03c9) is concentrated in the zone Zk := {(b, a); | \u03c6\u2032k( \u03c9\u03c8 a )\u2212b a | < \u2206},\nand the energy distribution of W \u03c8\u0302X(b, a) is concentrated in the zones \u22c3\n1\u2264k\u2264K Zk. Thus, zone Zk provides\nan estimate of the main energy distribution region of W \u03c8\u0302Xk(b, a). Compared with the class H ,d for TSWT, the class C ,d for NTEWT is not restricted to the class H ,d composed of several harmonic-like components, which is mathematically defined as:\nDefinition 10. The class C ,d is said to be a set of all superposition of weakly-separated frequency-varying chirp-like components (WFCC) up to accuracy > 0 and with separation dk,k+1 > 0, if each element\nX(\u03c9) = K\u2211 k=1 Xk(\u03c9) = K\u2211 k=1 Ak(\u03c9)e \u2212i\u03c6k(\u03c9) satisfies the following four conditions:\n(1) Regularity conditions:\nAk(\u03c9) \u2208 L\u221e(R) \u2229 C2(R), \u03c6k(\u03c9) \u2208 C3(R), k \u2208 {1, 2, ...,K}.\n(2) Boundedness conditions:\n0 < inf \u03c9\u2208R Ak(\u03c9) \u2264 sup \u03c9\u2208R Ak(\u03c9) < +\u221e, k \u2208 {1, 2, ...,K}\n0 < inf \u03c9\u2208R \u03c6\u2032k(\u03c9) \u2264 sup \u03c9\u2208R \u03c6\u2032k(\u03c9) < +\u221e, sup \u03c9\u2208R |\u03c6\u2032\u2032k(\u03c9)| < +\u221e.\n(3) Growth conditions:\n|A\u2032k(\u03c9)|, |\u03c6\u2032\u2032\u2032k (\u03c9)| \u2264 |\u03c6\u2032\u2032k(\u03c9)|, k \u2208 {1, 2, ...,K}.\n(4) Weakly-separated conditions: Xk(\u03c9) are separated with the distance dk,k+1 > 0, i.e.\n\u03c6\u2032k+1(\u03c9)\u2212 \u03c6\u2032k(\u03c9) \u2265 dk,k+1 \u03c9 , \u03c9 \u2208 R+, k \u2208 {1, 2, ...,K \u2212 1}. (37)\nIntuitively, the function class C ,d is composed of several oscillatory components Xk(\u03c9), where the\nchange rate (in frequency) of Ak(\u03c9) and \u03c6 \u2032\u2032 k(\u03c9) is much smaller than the change rate of \u03c6 \u2032 k(\u03c9) itself, which means that each component Xk(\u03c9) can be viewed as approximately a chirp signal locally in the frequency domain, with slowly varying amplitude Ak(\u03c9) and \u03c6 \u2032\u2032 k(\u03c9). It is worth noting that, different from the constant separation constant d in the well-separated condition (36), each separation constant dk,k+1 in the weakly-separated condition (37) here varies with components.\nOur main result is then the following: Theorem 2. Let X(\u03c9) = K\u2211 k=1 Xk(\u03c9) \u2208 C ,d, and set \u0303 := 1 4 . Pick a wavelet \u03c8\u0302(\u03c9) such that inverse\nFT \u03c8\u03c6(t) of its variant \u03c8\u0302\u03c6(\u03c9) = e i\u03c6\u2032\u2032k ( \u03c9\u03c8 a ) \u03c92 2a2 \u03c8\u0302(\u03c9 + \u03c9\u03c8) satisfies the following conditions: if |t| > \u2206k with dk,k+1 > max{\u03c9\u03c8\u2206k, \u03c9\u03c8\u2206k+1}, \u03c8\u03c6(t) \u2264 G0, \u03c8\u2032\u03c6(t) \u2264 G1, \u03c8\u2032\u2032\u03c6(t) \u2264 G2, with G0, G1, G2 being some constants. Consider the WT W \u03c8\u0302X(b, a) of X(\u03c9) with respect to \u03c8\u0302(\u03c9), as well as the NTEWT NTe(b, a). For k \u2208 {1, 2, ...,K \u2212 1}, define a set Tk := {(b, a); \u03a0k(a) < b < \u03a0k(a)}, with\n\u03a0k(a) = max{\u03c6\u2032k\u22121( \u03c9\u03c8 a ) + a\u2206k\u22121, \u03c6 \u2032 k( \u03c9\u03c8 a )\u2212 a\u2206k}, \u03a01(a) = \u03c6\u20321( \u03c9\u03c8 a )\u2212\u22061, \u03a0k(a) = min{\u03c6\u2032k( \u03c9\u03c8 a ) + a\u2206k, \u03c6 \u2032 k+1( \u03c9\u03c8 a )\u2212 a\u2206k+1}, \u03a0K(a) = \u03c6\u2032K( \u03c9\u03c8 a ) + \u2206K , (38)\nThen, provided is sufficiently small, the following hold:\n(a) For k \u2208 {1, 2, ...,K \u2212 1}, and for each pair (b, a), we have Tk 6= \u2205 with (\u03c6\u2032k( \u03c9\u03c8 a ), a) \u2208 Tk, and\nTk \u2229 Tk+1 = \u2205.\n(b) For each k \u2208 {1, . . . ,K \u2212 1}, and for each pair (b, a) \u2208 Tk for which holds |W \u03c8\u0302X(b, a)| > \u0303, then\nwe have\n|t\u0304X(b, a)\u2212 \u03c6\u2032k( \u03c9\u03c8 a )| \u2264 \u0303. (39)\n(c) Moreover, for each k \u2208 {1, . . . ,K}, and for each pair (b, a) \u2208 Tk, there exists a constant C > 0\nsuch that,\n| 2\u03c0aNTe(\u03c6\u2032k( \u03c9\u03c8 a ), a)e\n\u2212i \u03c9\u03c8 a \u03c6 \u2032 k( \u03c9\u03c8 a )\n\u03c8\u2217\u03c6(0) \u2212Xk( \u03c9\u03c8 a )| \u2264 C\u0303.\nTheorem 2 basically tells us that:\n(a) If dk,k+1 > max{\u03c9\u03c8\u2206k, \u03c9\u03c8\u2206k+1}, then weakly-separated chirp-like components of C ,d may interfere with each other. However, each zone Tk does not intersect with each other, the zone Tk corresponds to the energy distribution region of W \u03c8\u0302Xk(b, a) of the kth component Xk(\u03c9) at the point (\u03c6 \u2032 k( \u03c9\u03c8 a ), a) and its vicinity, and the zone Tk for component Xk(\u03c9) is separated from the main energy distribution regions of WT of other components.\n(b) The NGD estimator t\u0304X(b, a) is indeed a high-precision GD estimator in the zone Tk. (c) The signal can be reconstructed with reasonably high accuracy by NTEWT.\nThe proof of this theorem is available in Appendix A. In the Lemma 3 of Appendix A, to further\ncompare Tk and Zk, we modify the set Zk for TSWT [38], i.e. Zk = {(b, a); | \u03c6\u2032k( \u03c9\u03c8 a )\u2212b a | < \u2206} and well-separated condition \u03c6\u2032k+1(\u03c9) \u2212 \u03c6\u2032k(\u03c9) \u2265 d\u03c9 with d > 2\u03c9\u03c8\u2206. In Lemma 3, we define a set Zk := {(b, a); |\u03c6 \u2032 k( \u03c9\u03c8 a )\u2212b a | < \u2206k} and well-separated condition \u03c6 \u2032 k+1(\u03c9)\u2212\u03c6\u2032k(\u03c9) \u2265 dk,k+1 \u03c9 with dk,k+1 > \u03c9\u03c8(\u2206k + \u2206k+1). The set Zk we define in Lemma 3 is slightly different from the set Zk for TSWT [38], we assume dk,k+1 and \u2206k vary with components, but d and \u2206 in [38] are constant.\nThe focus here is on proving that: (1) the relationship between Tk satisfying weakly-separated condition and Zk satisfying well-separated condition; (2) if the change-rate (in frequency) of the Ak(\u03c9) and \u03c6\u2032\u2032k(\u03c9) is small, compared with the change-rate of the GD \u03c6 \u2032 k(\u03c9) themselves, then the proposed method\nwill identify and characterize the information of the signal X(\u03c9) and their GDs. It can be concluded that, for frequency-varying signals with weakly-separated chirp-like components, the NTEWT can effectively represent them with satisfied TF energy concentration and reasonable reconstruction accuracy. Besides, in the future, we will try to follow the ideas and analysis methods of Daubechies [46] and Sejdic\u0301 [47] about the theoretical analysis of noise, to further carry out a detailed and in-depth theoretical analysis of noise."

It can be observed that some TFA post-processing methods along the frequency direction, such as SWT and MSWT, provide blurred TFRs for frequency-varying signals X(\u03c9). However, some TFA post-processing methods along the time direction, such as TSST, TSST2 and NTEWT, improve the readability of TFRs of frequencyvarying signals X(\u03c9). The RS along the time and frequency directions also obtain a high resolution TFR. Compared with the other five methods, NTEWT generates the most concentrated TFR, obtains the least\nRe\u0301nyi entropy, and suffers the least interference at high frequency, which means the NTEWT behaves the best TF concentration performance for X(\u03c9). Meanwhile, Table 1 lists the numerical execution time of these TFA methods in addressing frequency-varying signals X(\u03c9). It can be seen that under the framework of STFT, TSST and TSST2 can finish the analysis within one second. However, these TFA methods under the framework of WT need more time than TSST and TSST2, while NTEWT needs much less time than SWT, MSWT and RS.\nIn order to study the performance of TF concentration of those TFA methods in the presence of noise, we add Gaussian white noise with signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of 0 dB to the test signal (see Fig. 3 and Fig. 4). Compared with other TF results, NTEWT achieves the highest resolution TFR and obtains the\nleast Re\u0301nyi entropy. Therefore, the NTEWT has clear advantages in addressing strongly-varying signals in the frequency domain, even in noisy conditions.\nTo further compare the TF concentration performance of these TFA methods under different noise levels, Fig. 5 displays the Re\u0301nyi entropy curves of five TFA methods under SNRs of 0 dB to 30 dB. It can be shown that, no matter under any SNR, the Re\u0301nyi entropy curves of NTEWT and RS are always\nbelow the Re\u0301nyi entropy curves of TSST2, MSWT and TSST, which means that the Re\u0301nyi entropy values of NTEWT and RS are smaller. However, compared with RS reassigning along the time direction and frequency direction, NTEWT extracting only along the time direction has smaller Re\u0301nyi entropies. It\nfollows that among these TFA methods, NTEWT obtains the lowest Re\u0301nyi entropy and behaves the best TF concentration performance whatever the noise level. Thus, NTEWT provides the most concentrated TFRs for analyzing noisy signals or noise-free signals.\nFurthermore, we use the second quantified indicator, i.e., MRE, to evaluate the performance of NTEWT on detecting the GD feature of the signal, MRE can be employed to measure the errors of estimated GD, which is defined by [34],\nMRE = 1 NG \u2016 G\u0302D\u2212GD GD \u20161, (43)\nwhere \u2016 \u00b7 \u20161 denotes l1-norm, NG is the discrete length of the GD, GD and G\u0302D respectively represent the true GD and the estimated GD. Generally, a lower MRE value means a better GD estimation performance. In Fig. 6, red lines denote true GD trajectory, blue lines denote estimated GD trajectories, and MRE values are written on both sides. As shown in Fig. 6, for two TFA post-processing methods along the frequency direction, the GD trajectory estimated by SWT deviates from the true GD trajectory most seriously, and as the second-order extension of SWT, MSWT reduces the deviation of both. However, for three TFA post-processing methods along the time direction, the GD trajectories estimated by TSST, TSST2 and NTEWT are closer to the true GD trajectory. Moreover, for RS along the frequency direction and the time direction, the GD trajectory estimated by RS is also very close to the true GD trajectory. It can be also seen that the GD trajectories estimated by the SWT, MSWT, TSST and TSST2 are interfered at high frequency, while the GD trajectories estimated by RS and NTEWT are almost unaffected at high frequency, and highly consistent with the true GD trajectory. And the MREs of GD estimated by RS and NTEWT are smaller than those of the other four TFA methods. Thus, RS and NTEWT shows better GD estimation performance.\nFinally, the third quantified indicator RQF is used to evaluate the reconstruction performance, which\nis defined as [40]\nRQF = 10 log10 \u2016x(t)\u20162\n\u2016x(t)\u2212 xr(t)\u20162 , (44)\nwhere x(t) and xr(t) denote the original signal and the reconstructed signal, respectively. A higher RQF value indicates a better reconstruction performance. Figs. 7, 8 show reconstructed results of five TFA methods and their respective RQF values, and we find that the RQF values of TSST, TSST2 and NTEWT are lower than those of SWT and MSWT, and NTEWT achieves the smallest reconstruction error and the highest RQF value, it means that NTEWT behaves better reconstruction performance than other four reconstruction methods. Therefore, it can be concluded that, the TFA methods for post-processing operations along the time direction has more obvious advantages, in analyzing the strongly-varying signals in the frequency domain, than the TFA methods for post-processing operations along the frequency direction, especially the NTEWT behaves the best TF concentration, GD estimation and reconstruction performance for strongly frequency-varying signal X(\u03c9) through three quantified indicators."

            "text": "In this subsection, we employe two real-world signals to validate the effectiveness of the proposed method. The first case is a popular bat signal recorded by Rice University [32], its waveform and spectrum are displayed in Fig. 9 (a), (b). We first use NTEWT to reconstruct the signal, and its reconstruction results are shown in Fig. 9 (c), (d). It can be seen that NTEWT can reconstruct signals well with high RQF value and with small reconstruction error, thus NTEWT behaves the good reconstruction ability. Furthermore, in order to understand the non-linear behaviors of the bat signal precisely, we use SWT, MSWT, RS, TSST, TSST2 and NTEWT to analyze the bat signal, and corresponding TF results are shown in Figs. 10, 11. Both the quantitative measure by the Re\u0301nyi entropy and the visual interpretation show that the NTEWT can accurately characterize the bat signal and essentially improve the TF energy concentration of the bat signal.\nNext, we consider a bearing vibration signal with the outer race fault, which was recorded by the Case Western Reserve University [41], and its waveform and spectrum are displayed in Fig. 12. As shown in Fig. 12 (b), the frequency band of this vibration signal is mainly concentrated in the frequency range of 2.5-4 kHz, thus we compare the TF features of this frequency range in Figs. 13, 14. Focus on the TF results and Re\u0301nyi entropies, the NTEWT can provide a more concentrated TFR than other five TFA methods. This thus demonstrates the interest of the proposed new technique in real applications."

            "text": "The main contribution of this paper is the introduction of Newton GD estimator and NTEWT, and its theoretical analysis. In this paper, we firstly convert the GD estimation problem into solving the fixed point problem, and combine with Newton algorithm to propose the Newton GD estimator for a\nfrequency-varying linear chirp signal. Based on the Newton GD estimator, we then propose the NTEWT, which can achieve a high resolution TFR and reconstruct signal. Furthermore, we provide a precise mathematical definition for WFCC, and develop a comprehensive theoretical error analysis of NTEWT for WFCC, including approximate expression of WT, GD estimation and signal reconstruction. Finally, three quantitative indicators are used to compare NTEWT and other advanced TFA methods from the aspects of simulated and real signals. Both the quantitative indicators and the visual interpretation verify that the TFA post-processing methods along the time direction are more suitable for analyzing the stronglyvarying signals in the frequency domain than the TFA post-processing methods along the frequency\ndirection, especially the NTEWT has a more concentrated TFR, better GD estimation performance, and good reconstruction performance. In the future, we will try to develop a rigorous theoretical analysis of noise, and further explore the potential of the proposed method in practical applications.\nAppendix A For convenience, we divide the proof of Theorem 2 into several simple estimates and demonstrate one by one. The following lemma clearly explains the relationship between Tk satisfying weakly-separated condition and Zk satisfying well-separated condition.\nLemma 3. For k \u2208 {1, 2, ...,K}, define a set Zk\nZk := {(b, a); | \u03c6\u2032k( \u03c9\u03c8 a )\u2212 b a | < \u2206k}, (45)\nthen the following hold:\n(1) Tk \u2229 Tk+1 = \u2205, Tk \u2229 Zk+1 = \u2205 and Tk \u2282 Zk. (2) If dk,k+1 > max{\u03c9\u03c8\u2206k, \u03c9\u03c8\u2206k+1}, then Tk 6= \u2205 with (\u03c6\u2032k( \u03c9\u03c8 a ), a) \u2208 Tk. (3) If dk,k+1 > \u03c9\u03c8(\u2206k + \u2206k+1), then Tk = Zk.\nProof. (1) On the one hand, based on Eq. (38), \u03a0k(a) and \u03a0k+1(a) can be written as\n\u03a0k(a) = min{\u03c6\u2032k( \u03c9\u03c8 a ) + a\u2206k, \u03c6 \u2032 k+1( \u03c9\u03c8 a )\u2212 a\u2206k+1}, \u03a0k+1(a) = max{\u03c6\u2032k( \u03c9\u03c8 a ) + a\u2206k, \u03c6 \u2032 k+1( \u03c9\u03c8 a )\u2212 a\u2206k+1}, (46)\nit is obvious that \u03a0k(a) \u2264 \u03a0k+1(a), thus Tk \u2229 Tk+1 = \u2205. Combined with\n\u03a0k(a) \u2264 \u03c6\u2032k+1( \u03c9\u03c8 a )\u2212 a\u2206k+1, Zk+1 = {(b, a);\u03c6\u2032k+1( \u03c9\u03c8 a )\u2212 a\u2206k+1 < b < \u03c6\u2032k+1( \u03c9\u03c8 a ) + a\u2206k+1}, (47)\nit means that the lower boundary of the zones Zk+1 is above the upper boundary of the zones Tk, i.e. Tk \u2229 Zk+1 = \u2205.\nOn the other hand, for any (b, a) \u2208 Tk, i.e. \u03a0k(a) < b < \u03a0k(a), combined with\nb > \u03a0k(a) \u2265 \u03c6\u2032k( \u03c9\u03c8 a )\u2212 a\u2206k, b < \u03a0k(a) \u2264 \u03c6\u2032k( \u03c9\u03c8 a ) + a\u2206k, (48)\nthis gives (b, a) \u2208 Zk, and Tk \u2282 Zk. (2) Since X(\u03c9) = K\u2211 k=1 Xk(\u03c9) \u2208 C ,d, dk,k+1 satisfies the separation condition \u03c6\u2032k+1( \u03c9\u03c8 a ) \u2212 \u03c6 \u2032 k( \u03c9\u03c8 a ) \u2265 adk,k+1 \u03c9\u03c8 .

(50)\nConsidering\n\u03c6\u2032k( \u03c9\u03c8 a ) > max{\u03c6\u2032k\u22121( \u03c9\u03c8 a ) + a\u2206k\u22121, \u03c6 \u2032 k( \u03c9\u03c8 a )\u2212 a\u2206k} = \u03a0k(a), (51)\nand\n\u03c6\u2032k( \u03c9\u03c8 a ) < min{\u03c6\u2032k( \u03c9\u03c8 a ) + a\u2206k, \u03c6 \u2032 k+1( \u03c9\u03c8 a )\u2212 a\u2206k+1} = \u03a0k(a), (52)\nleads to (\u03c6\u2032k( \u03c9\u03c8 a ), a) \u2208 Tk, which means that Tk 6= \u2205.\n(3) According to separation condition and dk,k+1 > \u03c9\u03c8(\u2206k + \u2206k+1), we have \u03c6 \u2032 k+1( \u03c9\u03c8 a ) \u2212 \u03c6 \u2032 k( \u03c9\u03c8 a ) \u2265\nadk,k+1 \u03c9\u03c8 > a(\u2206k + \u2206k+1), which means that \u03c6 \u2032 k+1( \u03c9\u03c8 a )\u2212 a\u2206k+1 > \u03c6 \u2032 k( \u03c9\u03c8 a ) + a\u2206k. This leads to\n\u03a0k(a) = max{\u03c6\u2032k\u22121( \u03c9\u03c8 a ) + a\u2206k\u22121, \u03c6 \u2032 k( \u03c9\u03c8 a )\u2212 a\u2206k} = \u03c6\u2032k( \u03c9\u03c8 a )\u2212 a\u2206k, \u03a0k(a) = min{\u03c6\u2032k( \u03c9\u03c8 a ) + a\u2206k, \u03c6 \u2032 k+1( \u03c9\u03c8 a )\u2212 a\u2206k+1} = \u03c6\u2032k( \u03c9\u03c8 a ) + a\u2206k. (53)\nThus, when dk,k+1 > \u03c9\u03c8(\u2206k + \u2206k+1), we have Tk = Zk.\nThe above lemma indicates that:\n(1) Each zone Tk does not intersect with each other, Tk is a subset of Zk. Moreover, Tk and\nZ`(` 6= k) don\u2019t intersect, which means that the zone Tk for component Xk(\u03c9) is separated from the zone\nZ` for other component X`(\u03c9), and it has been proved that in [38], Z` provides an estimate of the main energy distribution region of W \u03c8\u0302X`(b, a).\n(2) It is noteworthy that when dk,k+1 > max{\u03c9\u03c8\u2206k, \u03c9\u03c8\u2206k+1}, weakly-separated chirp-like compo-\nnents of C ,d may interfere with each other, and the zone Tk corresponds to the energy distribution region of W \u03c8\u0302Xk(b, a) of the kth component Xk(\u03c9) at the point (\u03c6 \u2032 k( \u03c9\u03c8 a ), a) and its vicinity.\n(3) If dk,k+1 > \u03c9\u03c8(\u2206k+\u2206k+1), then we have Tk = Zk, it follows that weakly-separated conditions are restricted to well-separated cases, and the class C ,d contains some signals with well-separated components.\nIn what follows, denote Mk = sup \u03c9\u2208R Ak(\u03c9) < \u221e, M \u2032k = max(sup \u03c9\u2208R |A\u2032k(\u03c9)|, sup \u03c9\u2208R \u03c6\u2032k(\u03c9)) < \u221e, M \u2032\u2032k = sup \u03c9\u2208R |\u03c6\u2032\u2032k(\u03c9)| <\u221e. If O(A\u2032k) and O(\u03c6\u2032\u2032\u2032k ) are neglected, the kth component Xk(\u03c9) can be approximated by Taylor expansion as\nXk(\u03c9) \u2248 X\u0303k(\u03c9) = Ak( \u03c9\u03c8 a )e\u2212i[\u03c6k( \u03c9\u03c8 a )+\u03c6 \u2032 k( \u03c9\u03c8 a )(\u03c9\u2212 \u03c9\u03c8 a )+ 1 2\u03c6 \u2032\u2032 k ( \u03c9\u03c8 a )(\u03c9\u2212 \u03c9\u03c8 a ) 2]. (54)\nTo simplify some notations, denote tk(b, a) = \u03c6\u2032k( \u03c9\u03c8 a )\u2212b a . If (b, a) \u2208 Tk, then |tk(b, a)| < \u2206k.
