    "abstractText": "Robust and sensitive ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC\u2013MS/MS) combined with the quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) method was applied for the detection of seven Alternaria toxins (ATs) in tuberous crops. The influence of tuber conditions (fresh, germinated, and moldy) during storage on the concentration of the seven ATs is also investigated. ATs were extracted with acetonitrile under acidic conditions and purified with a C18 adsorbent. ATs were scanned with electrospray ionization (positive/negative ion) dynamic switching and detected in MRM mode. Calibration curve analysis results reveal good linear relationships in all toxin concentration ranges (R2 > 0.99). The limit of detection and limit of quantification were 0.25\u20130.70 and 0.83\u20132.31 \u03bcg/kg, respectively. The average recoveries of the seven ATs were 83.2\u2013104% with intra-/ inter-day precision at 3.52\u20136.55% and 4.02\u20137.26%, respectively. The developed method provided adequate selectivity, sensitivity, and precision in detecting the seven ATs at trace levels, and dispensed with standard addition or matrix-matched calibration to compensate for matrix effects. ATs in the fresh, germinated, and moldy samples of tuberous crops in storage (taro, potato, sweet potato, yam, cassava) were analyzed with this method, and the concentrations were 2.01\u201314.51 \u03bcg/kg and significantly increased with storage duration. ALS was detected in most samples, whereas no quantities of ALT and ATX-I were detected. AME was often detected in combination with AOH in sweet potatoes. TeA and Ten were mostly detected in taro, potato, and yam. The established method could be used for the simultaneous detection and quantification of multicomponent toxins in elaborate matrices.",

There are different kinds of tuberous crops, including taro, potato, sweet potato, yam, and cassava, which are used in traditional staple foods (e.g., steamed bread, noodles, rice noodles) and cereal-based food. Tuberous crops are highly susceptible to Alternaria fungi under various climatic conditions [2,3]. Alternaria fungi infect tubers, causing black or brown spots on the tuber surface that are difficult to remove with washing and sorting, eventually evolving into tuber rot that significantly affects crop yield and quality [4]. Being an omnipresent fungal genus, Alternaria spp. can cause pre- and postharvest damage to agricultural products, especially high-water-content and nutrient-rich cereal grains, fruits, and vegetables [5,6]. Alternaria toxins (ATs) are fungal metabolites generated by Alternaria in polluted food that can severely\nFoods 2023, 12, 862. https://doi.org/10.3390/foods12040862 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/foods\nFoods 2023, 12, 862 2 of 15\naffect animal and human health. The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) uses the threshold of toxicological concern (TTC) approach to assess the human health effects of some ATs. For genotoxic AOH and AME, 95% of the estimated mean dietary exposures exceeded the TTC value (2.5 ng/kg body weight (bw) per day), while for nongenotoxic TeA and Ten, the TTC value was 1500 ng/kg bw/day [7]. ATs can seriously threaten human health when consumed in excess of the TTC value, resulting in salivation, vomiting, erythema, convulsions, gastrointestinal hemorrhage, and immunosuppression [8,9]. Therefore, the accurate and quantitative detection of ATs in food including tuberous crops is increasingly important not only for research projects, but also risk evaluation studies [10,11]. These contaminants principally pertain to five different chemical categories (Figure 1) [7,12]: (1) dibenzo-\u03b1-pyrones derivatives, including alternariol (AOH), alternariol monomethyl ether (AME), and altenuene (ALT); (2) tetramic acid derivatives, e.g., tenuazonic acid (TeA) and iso-tenuazonic acid (iso-TeA); (3) perylene quinones derivatives, the main members of which are altertoxin (i.e, ATX-I, ATX-II and ATX-III), stemphyltoxin (STTX-III), and alterperylenol (ALP), which yield large amounts at the preharvest section [13,14]; (4) aminopentol esters, such as A. alternata f. sp. lycopersici toxins (AAL toxins); (5) disordered structures on behalf of tentoxin (Ten), altenusin (ALS), and altersetin (AST).\nFoods 2023, 12, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 17\nsurface that are difficult to remove with washing and sorting, eventually evolving into tuber rot that significantly affects crop yield and quality [4].

Chemical structure of Alternaria toxins.\nThe most prevalent ATs are mainly focused on AOH, AME, TeA, and Ten, whereas the occurrence of other ATs is fairly scarce, mostly owing to the deficiency of analytical methodologies [15]. Furthermore, the detection of ATs has focused on cereals and fruits [16]. For instance, Gotthardt et al. [16] developed a systematic analytical technology for eight ATs (AOH, AME, TeA, Ten, ATX-I, ATX-II, ALTP, and STTX-III) in single-/multigrain goods (spelt wheat, oats, millet, rice, and wheat) used in baby food. Wang et al. [17] established a method for the detection of five ATs in fruits (apple, sweet cherry, tomato, and orange) via a homemade solid-phase extraction (SPE) cartridge step followed by ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography\u2013tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC\u2013MS/MS); the recovery values\nFoods 2023, 12, 862 3 of 15\nwere between 74.2% and 102.4%, the relative standard deviation (RSD) was less than 4.7%, and the limits of quantification (LOQ) were in the range of 1\u20135 \u00b5g/kg. However, few analytical AT studies have focused on tuberous crops. Only one such study from China was published, where AOH, AME and ALT were tested in 50 samples of sweet potato by using pressure capillary electrochromatography combined with SPE [4]. Tuberous crops under favorable environmental conditions (e.g., high temperature and moisture) during hoarding are prone to germination and molding, and the subsequent contamination by toxins produced by fungi [18]. Once formed, these toxins are stable and not easy to decompose. Food-processing methods and traditional storage criteria have not been able to entirely eliminate toxin pollution in the food delivery chain [19]. Thus, it is essential to monitor the content of ATs using analytical technologies during storage. To overcome the deficit of research on ATs in tuberous crops and their change during storage, the main challenge is to establish a technology that can perform the rapid and simple extraction of these contaminants from tuberous crops products, tackling issues that arise mainly due to the discrepancy in the physicochemical characters of ATs. Extraction is a key process because it detects the recovery of total toxins in research [20]. UPLC\u2013MS/MS has been an important asset in the analysis of ATs [21]. Triple quadrupole (QqQ) is widely used as a major tool for the qualification and quantification of toxins because of its higher sensitivity, specificity, and effectiveness [22,23]. Among the latest trends that are attractive alternatives, sample pretreatments for detecting trace mycotoxins via UPLC\u2013MS/MS predominantly apply the SPE and quick, easy, cheap, effective, rugged, and safe (QuEChERS) methods [24,25]. Although SPE is valid for eliminating disturbance impurities from matrices, it is time-consuming and complicated. QuEChERS technologies have been successfully applied for the simultaneous determination of toxins in cereals because this rapid and easy process is obviously superior and has high determination throughput [26]. Therefore, the application of QuEChERS methods is essential for monitoring or studying multiple ATs in tuberous crops. This study aims to establish a reliable and simple UPLC\u2013MS/MS technology for the homochromous assay of AOH, AME, TeA, Ten, ATX-I, ALS, and ALT metabolized by Alternaria fungi during storage, coupled with QuEChERS pretreatment for the purification of ATs from tuberous crop samples. The technology was majorized and validated with authentic samples."

The ionization mode (ESI+/\u2212) was determined on the basis of the chemical ionization properties of the seven types of ATs. Six ATs (AOH, AME, TeA, Ten, ALT and ALS) dissolved in the acetonitrile/water solution (50/50, v/v) could produce [M + H]+ parent ions with high abundance in ESI+ mode, while ATX-I could generate high responses in ESI\u2212 mode (Figure 2). Subsequently, we selected MRM shifts and the optimal response of the relevant acquisition parameters (collision energy and cone voltage) under ESI+/\u2212 mode conditions by injecting the standard solution into the mobile phase with an injection pump (Table 1).

            "text": "3.2.1. Selection of UPLC Columns\nThe choice of UPLC columns with quick measurement, high sensitivity, and efficient separation is a precondition for developing multiplex detection methods. Therefore, two LC columns with diverse lengths and particle diameters, that is, (A) the BEH C18 column (100 \u00d7 2.1 mm I.D., 1.7 \u00b5m, Waters, Milford City, MA, USA) and (B) the HSS T3 column (50 \u00d7 2.1 mm I.D., 1.8 \u00b5m, Waters, Milford City, MA, USA) were chosen for their isolation efficiency. The isolation efficiency and sensitivity of Column A were much better than those of Column B because column efficiency was obviously enhanced with the increase in surface area per unit volume. Furthermore, the hybrid particles used in the BEH C18 column have the advantages of a wide pH range (1\u201312), lower secondary interactions, faster analysis, higher resolution, better peak shape, and higher column efficiency. Although the HSS T3 column had strong retention capacity, ALT and ALS had no obvious peak shape, and TeA exhibited a tailing phenomenon. Hence, the entire isolation process of the seven ATs was completed in only 10 min by using a BEH C18 column at a 0.4 mL/min flow rate, which fitted well with the MS/MS electrospray ionization conditions (Figure 2).\n3.2.2. Mobile Phase Selection\nIn addition to optimizing the separation efficiency of the chromatographic system for good resolution and high sensitivity, the selection of the mobile phase is crucial, as it affects the ionization efficiency of the compounds before they enter the MS/MS system. Results of the MS full scan of the seven ATs indicate that AOH, AME, TeA, Ten, ALT, and ALS could generate the corresponding [M + H]+ ions with the mobile phase of water/acetonitrile in ESI+ electroscopy mode, and ATX-I generated [M + H]\u2212 ions under ESI\u2212 electroscopic mode. Except for TeA, the responses of the [M + H]+ parent ions changed obviously when 0.1% (v/v) FA or 10 mmol/L ammonium formate was added. Nevertheless, when 10 mmol/L of ammonium formate was added, the abundance and sensitivity of TeA were obviously alleviated in ESI+ electroscopic mode. Considering the principles affecting separation efficiency and detection sensitivity, 0.1% (v/v) FA was a reasonable compromise. Regarding the option of strongly eluting mobile phase, methanol and acetonitrile were considered as candidates because most mycotoxins are freely soluble in these two solvents [29]. The results show that, when acetonitrile was selected as the mobile phase, the ionization degree of all selected analytes was greatly increased under [M + H]+ and [M + H]\u2212 electroscopic modes. Thus, acetonitrile was chosen as the strong elution mobile phase for this study.

Optimization of Sample Pretreatment QuEChERS employs a solvent for liquid\u2013liquid partitioning, and uses adsorbents to purify the extracts. This method is popular in food pollutants due to its simplicity, minimal number of steps, and for being able to successfully eliminate interfering compounds from samples [30]. To choose a suitable extraction solvent, methanol and acetonitrile, and different proportions of FA\u2013methanol or FA\u2013acetonitrile solution were successively used on the basis of the solubility of the seven ATs. Moreover, TeA (pKa = 3.5) is an acidic compound [31], and the pH of the extraction system was lower than pKa to facilitate the distribution of TeA in the organic phase. After extraction, the samples were dehydrated using MgSO4 and stratified via a salting-out procedure using NaCl. The results show that high extraction efficiency and recovery of the selected analytes, which were higher than 70%, were achieved when an FA\u2013acetonitrile solution was used as the extraction solvent (Figure 4). Considering the recommended ratio of FA, a 1.5% FA\u2013 acetonitrile solution was selected as the extraction solvent. To assess the optimal extraction solvent, it is invaluable to compare it with other validated reference methods. In such a consideration, we used validated methodologies that mainly included fruits and vegetables extracted with a 1.5% FA\u2013acetonitrile solution, and analyzed with LC\u2013ESI\u2013 MS/MS [32] or UPLC\u2013MS/MS [33] to compare them with the current method. In addition, acetonitrile could precipitate proteins, clearing the extract and reducing impurities in the purification step. Therefore, 1.5% FA\u2013acetonitrile was eventually selected as the extraction solvent for pretreatment."

Matrix Effect\nThe method matrix effects (MEs) are where the ionization signal of analytes is suppressed or enhanced in UPLC\u2013MS/MS analysis. Notably, in ESI mode, various physical and chemical processes can affect ionization signals. In particular, MEs are hard to eliminate [33,39]. In the present study, 30 samples (6 samples from each of the following: taro, potato, sweet potato, yam, and cassava) were selected to evaluate the MEs. Each sample was mixed and extracted as previously mentioned (Section 2.5). The reserve fluid was then diluted with pure solvents to prepare a certain concentration of mixed standard work solution to obtain precise results for all matrices. These solutions were totally determined under optimal instrumentation conditions. MEs were then calculated with Equation (1), which yielded a range of 84.5\u2013133.2% (Table 2). Particularly, the MEs of AME and ATX-I were slightly higher than 120, a fact that can be ignored."

We analyzed 30 samples (6 from each of the following: taro, potato, sweet potato, yam, and cassava). The results demonstrate that the detected concentrations of the seven ATs in these samples varied. As listed in Table 3, the main contaminating toxins in the tuberous crops during storage were TeA, AOH, AME, ALS, and Ten. In the absence of germination or mold, the maximal concentrations were 2.13 \u00b5g/kg for TeA, 2.74 \u00b5g/kg for AOH, 2.01 \u00b5g/kg for AME, 9.47 \u00b5g/kg for ALS, and 5.08 \u00b5g/kg for Ten. After germination, the content of the seven ATs was slightly higher than that at the fresh stage of tubers. The experimental results show that the content of the seven ATs of the tuberous crops was much higher after tubers had molded than that of fresh and germinated tubers after storage (3.87 \u00b5g/kg for TeA, 4.73 \u00b5g/kg for AOH, 3.25 \u00b5g/kg for AME, 14.51 \u00b5g/kg for ALS, 7.46 \u00b5g/kg for Ten). The frequency of detection in tuberous crops further increased in the rotten tubers, probably due to the progress of Alternaria infection increasing the fungal biomass during storage. In summary, ALT was not detected during storage, which was comparative with the results of Yuan et al. [4]. Furthermore, AME often occurs in conjunction with AOH, which is in accordance with the investigation of Yan et al. [40]. ALS was detected in most samples, whereas ATX-I was almost undetectable. TeA was mainly detected in taro and potato, AME and AOH in sweet potato, and Ten in yam tubers. Notably, the AT contamination of tuberous crops takes place during storage.
