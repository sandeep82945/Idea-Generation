    "abstractText": "Peripheral membrane-associated proteins are known to accumulate on the surface of biomembranes as result of membrane-mediated interactions. For a pair of rotationally-symmetric curvatureinducing proteins, membrane mechanics at the low-temperature limit predicts pure repulsion. On the other hand, temperature-dependent entropic forces arise between pairs of stiff-binding proteins suppressing membrane fluctuations. These Casimir-like interactions have thus been suggested as candidates for attractive force leading to aggregation. With dense assemblies of peripheral proteins on the membrane, both these abstractions encounter multi-body complications. Here, we make use of a particle-based membrane model augmented with flexible peripheral proteins to quantify purely membrane-mediated interactions and investigate their underlying nature. We introduce a continuous reaction coordinate corresponding to the progression of protein aggregation. We obtain free energy and entropy landscapes for different surface concentrations along this reaction coordinate. In parallel, we investigate time-dependent estimates of membrane entropy corresponding to membrane undulations and coarse-grained tilt field and how they also change dynamically with protein aggregation. Congruent outcomes of the two approaches point to the conclusion that for low surface concentrations, interactions with an entropic nature may drive the aggregation. But at high concentrations, energetic contributions due to concerted membrane deformation by protein clusters are dominant.",

            "text": "Investigating the entropic nature of membrane-mediated interactions driving the aggregation of peripheral proteins\nMohsen Sadeghi1, \u2217 1Department of Mathematics and Computer Science,\nFreie Universita\u0308t Berlin, Arnimallee 12, 14195 Berlin, Germany\nPeripheral membrane-associated proteins are known to accumulate on the surface of biomembranes as result of membrane-mediated interactions. For a pair of rotationally-symmetric curvatureinducing proteins, membrane mechanics at the low-temperature limit predicts pure repulsion. On the other hand, temperature-dependent entropic forces arise between pairs of stiff-binding proteins suppressing membrane fluctuations. These Casimir-like interactions have thus been suggested as candidates for attractive force leading to aggregation. With dense assemblies of peripheral proteins on the membrane, both these abstractions encounter multi-body complications. Here, we make use of a particle-based membrane model augmented with flexible peripheral proteins to quantify purely membrane-mediated interactions and investigate their underlying nature. We introduce a continuous reaction coordinate corresponding to the progression of protein aggregation. We obtain free energy and entropy landscapes for different surface concentrations along this reaction coordinate. In parallel, we investigate time-dependent estimates of membrane entropy corresponding to membrane undulations and coarse-grained tilt field and how they also change dynamically with protein aggregation. Congruent outcomes of the two approaches point to the conclusion that for low surface concentrations, interactions with an entropic nature may drive the aggregation. But at high concentrations, energetic contributions due to concerted membrane deformation by protein clusters are dominant.\nBiomembranes are physical and chemical boundaries of cells and many of their organelles, as well as quasitwo-dimensional universes of encounters and actions behind a vast variety of vital functions [1]. Many aspects of membrane dynamics, configuration, topology, and even composition are actively controlled by membraneassociated proteins, facilitating, among others, cellular motility [2], proliferation [3], response to stimuli [4], trafficking and endocytosis [5\u20138]. This renders the understanding of localization, organization and action of these proteins of utmost importance. Peripheral proteins are a prominent class of membrane proteins, which can, through curvature-generation, contribute to membrane remodeling [9, 10]. The actual mechanism with which these proteins can sense or induce membrane curvature may vary [11\u201314], but the important commonality is how the concerted action of a collection of these proteins can lead to macroscopic membrane deformations [15, 16]. As an example, it was established early on that the internalization of Cholera toxin from cell membrane into endoplasmic reticulum can progress with or without relying on clathrin- or caveolae-mediated endocytosis [17]. Or when bound to glycolipids on the outer leaflet of giant unilamellar vesicles (GUV\u2019s), the pentagonal subunit B of Shiga toxin (STxB) was shown to induce invaginations, and long tubules, in the absence of active cellular machinery [18]. This rather elegant entry mechanism, which has promoted STxB as a model for glycolipid-dependent endocytosis [19], has also inspired using it as a vehicle for drug delivery and anticancer therapy purposes [20\u201322]. The fact that mem-\n\u2217 mohsen.sadeghi@fu-berlin.de\nbrane remodeling leading to internalization of these toxins can progress without relying on energy-consuming cell machinery has fueled the research into understanding the underlying protein-membrane mechanical interplay [15, 23, 24].\nOrganization of peripheral proteins is a complex and multi-scale phenomenon. Focusing on peripheral proteins inducing isotropic local curvature, effects ranging from lipid compression [14] and lipid phase separation [25] to active cytoskeletal forces [26] are considered to play a role. Focusing on length-scales at which the membrane can be modeled as a continuous surface, the free energy density corresponding to membrane deformations very well conforms with the Helfrich function f = 2\u03ba (H \u2212H0)2 + \u03ba\u0304G, where H, G and H0 are the mean, Gaussian and spontaneous curvatures, and \u03ba and \u03ba\u0304 are the attributed elastic constants [27\u201331]. Utilizing this model, and minimizing total free energy in the presence of two inclusions with isotropic curvature of the same sign predicts \u201ccurvature-mediated\u201d repulsion [32\u201334]. Similar repulsion has also been shown to sort partially budded membrane domains [35]. On the other hand, a dense assembly of curvature-inducing proteins can minimize energy with collective membrane deformations, and even result in apparent attraction [36]. Attractive interaction is also possible when inclusions possess anisotropic curvatures [32, 37\u201339]. On the other hand, temperature-dependent \u201cfluctuation-mediated\u201d interactions have been implicated as the source of longrange attraction [23, 34, 40\u201344]. These thermal Casimirlike forces push proteins that suppress membrane fluctuations together to minimize their adverse entropic effect. Simulations focusing on these interactions have confirmed their effectiveness in protein organization [24, 45].\n2 Theoretical models and simulations in simplified scenarios that focus on certain type of membrane-mediated interactions are illuminating, but lack the generality in a more realistic setup where a dynamic membrane crowded with large numbers of peripheral proteins is evolving at timescales appropriate to the corresponding slow dynamics. The multi-scale nature of the problem connotes the usual trade-off between size and details, making it challenging to propose a model that can capture several aspects of peripheral protein interactions and organization. This spatiotemporal range of interest is very well covered by the so-called interacting particle reaction-diffusion (iPRD) models [46\u201349]. Proper to these models, we have recently developed an ultra coarse-grained membrane model [50, 51], with an accompanying hydrodynamic coupling method [52], which offers a remarkable balance between mimicking membrane mechanics and dynamics at the large scale and offering the possibility of small-scale effects, including flexible peripheral proteins inducing local curvatures [53, 54]. We implemented these membraneassociated proteins as particles tagged in the model to carry a masked force field as they freely diffused along the membrane. We took painstaking care to prevent the peripheral proteins to experience direct interactions as result of force field masking (see [54] and its Supplementary Information). The proteins aggregated on the membrane nonetheless, and the stiffest among them could form macroscopic clusters, given enough surface concentration, leading us to the conclusion that forces mediated by the membrane were responsible for this organization. Here, via similar large-scale simulations, we look into the actual origin of these forces. Specifically, we investigate the duality between energetic curvaturemediated and entropic fluctuation-mediated interactions in details. Using a liquid-mixture model, we first quantify pairwise membrane-mediated interactions and demonstrate the effect of protein stiffness and concentration. We subsequently use the continuous reaction coordinate highlighting protein aggregation to investigate the entropy landscape as a function of protein aggregation at different surface concentrations. We compare these entropies with two-dimensional configurational entropy due to surface distribution of proteins to show where aggregation enhances or diminishes overall entropy. Finally, we propose a method for direct estimation of entropy corresponding to fluctuations in membrane amplitude and lipid tilt field from simulation trajectories, and successfully repeat the same analysis thereon."

The model allows for observation and measurement of the emergent membrane-mediated interactions between these proteins. We employ the statistical mechanics of liquid mixtures to estimate the effective interactions between pairs of the constituents. We consider a two-dimensional fluid, consisting of either pure membrane (m) or protein-bound (p) particles, and respectively denote the effective pairwise interactions as umm, ump, and upp. We estimate these effective interactions from the set of all pair-correlation functions (details in Methods section \u201cStatistical mechanics of liquid mixtures\u201d). The interaction potential upp also contains contributions from the underlying membrane particles. To correct for this, we have simply calculated the net membrane mediated interaction as upp \u2212 umm (Fig. 1B).\nWe consider two prominent continuum-based models for comparison: (i) repulsive mean-field interactions between symmetrically curved regions, either from peripheral proteins or from stiff inclusions in the membrane [32\u201334]. These interactions stem from minimizing membrane elastic energy, neglecting fluctuations, thus corresponding to equilibrium at zero temperature [40]. For a pair of particles with the separation r, this interaction is approximated in the leading power by [34, 40, 44],\nUrep (r) = 8\u03c0\u03ba\u03b8 2 p (rp r )4 (1)\nwhere \u03b8p and rp are the contact angle and the radius of the curved region and \u03ba is the bending rigidity of the membrane. (ii) attractive entropic forces emerging when the binding is stiff enough to locally suppress membrane fluctuations at non-vanishing temperature (the so-called thermal Casimir effect). An approximate expression for the potential of this attractive interaction is [34, 40, 44],\nUatt (r) = \u22126kT (rp r )4 (2)\nMembrane-mediated interaction potentials that we obtained from the simulations show significant attraction at close range (Figs. 1B). For the stiffest proteins considered, this attraction is present even up to particle separations of 3a where a is the lattice parameter of the model (Figs. 1A and 1B). Attraction strength (depth of the potential well) for the first and second neighbors (\u2206u1 and \u2206u2, respectively) is proportional to the protein stiffness (Figs. 1B and 1C). Yet, looking at how the surface concentration of proteins affects the attraction (Fig. 1D) reveals non-trivial dependence, especially for the second-neighbor interactions. This points to the shortcoming of pairwise interaction model underlying the liquid-mixture model and reveals weak multibody contributions.\nHigher protein stiffness results in more pronounced curvatures [54], and subsequently closer possible approach of tagged particles in two dimensions (Fig. 1A).\n3 A\nYet, with the increase in protein stiffness, the closerange repulsion occurs at larger distances, evidently beyond the unperturbed lattice parameter, a (Fig. 1B). We thus conclude that aside from the steric repulsion of particles, which is similar for all cases, a curvaturemediated repulsion is also present.\nWe also observe a small repulsive barrier at the distance of \u223c 5a, which is not predicted by either of the two models (Fig. 1B). There is a clear relation between the barrier height, \u2206ub, and protein stiffness (Fig. 1C) which implies a long-range curvature-mediated effect.\nEntropy of protein aggregation from histogram analysis\nWe have performed equilibrium simulations with different surface concentration of peripheral proteins with the stiffness of 200 MPa and have used a reaction coordinate q to be a continuous descriptor of aggregation. This reaction coordinate is defined as the mean of inverse pairwise distances between bound proteins, with larger q values implying stronger aggregation (Figs. 2A and 2B, Methods section \u201cEntropy Estimation\u201d and [54]). We have affirmed the sensitivity of q to protein aggregation by obtaining clear separation of distributions for states that differ minutely in mean cluster size (Fig. 2C).\n4 A B\n1.0 1.5 2.0 2.5 Time [ms]\n10.2\n10.4\n10.6\n10.8\nR ea\nct io\nn co\nor d. q\n(t )\n[\u00b5 m \u2212\n1 ]\n2.10 nmol m\u22122 4.19 nmol m\u22122 8.29 nmol m\u22122\nC\n10.2 10.3 10.4 10.5 10.6\nq [\u00b5m\u22121]\n0.00\n0.02\n0.04\n0.06\n0.08\nP ro\nba bi\nlit y\n\u3008n\u3009 \u2264 3.1 \u3008n\u3009 \u2265 3.2\nD\n10.4 10.6 10.8\nq [\u00b5m\u22121]\n\u2212500\n\u2212250\n0\n250\nE nt\nha lp\ny \u2206 H /k T\nE\n10.4 10.6 10.8\nq [\u00b5m\u22121]\n\u2212100\n0\n100\nE nt\nro py\n\u2206 S /k\n0.10 nmol m\u22122 2.10 nmol m\u22122 4.19 nmol m\u22122 8.29 nmol m\u22122\nF\n0 2 4 6 8\nSurface concentration \u0393 [nmol m\u22122]\n0\n500\n1000\n1500\nE nt\nro py\n\u2206 S /k\nI II III\nHistogram-based estimate\n2D configurational entropy\nFigure 2: Entropy change due to protein aggregation studied via histogram-based estimates based on a continuous reaction coordinate: (A) Definition of the reaction coordinate q corresponding to the degree of aggregation, based on the pairwise distances between peripheral proteins.

(F) Mean entropy as a global function of surface concentration of proteins. The two-dimensional configurational entropy of proteins (Eq.

We observe the entropy as a function of q to have a concentration-dependent behavior (Fig. 2E). For low surface concentrations of 0.10 nmol m\u22122 and 2.10 nmol m\u22122, the entropy increases with q, compliant with entropic forces pushing toward more aggregation.\nBut as concentration increases to 4.19 nmol m\u22122 and 8.29 nmol m\u22122, this trend is reversed, with more aggregation lowering the entropy (Fig. 2E). The histograms of enthalpy along q reveals the energy to increase with q for low concentrations (Fig. 2D), but at the high concentrations, local energy minima explaining the observed aggregated states are present (Figs. 2D and 2B).\nCalculating the expectation value of the estimated entropy along q yields its mean value as a continuous\n5 function of surface concentration, \u0393 (Fig. 2F). We found it greatly beneficial to include a measure of twodimensional configurational entropy of indistinguishable particles with the same surface concentration (Eq. (10) and Fig. 2F). Firstly because the numerical proximity of the two entropy estimates serves as a sanity check for the histogram-based estimation (Fig. 2F). Secondly, the \u201ccontest\u201d between the two entropies introduces three distinct regimes (Fig. 2F): (I) histogrambased and configurational entropies are closely comparable at low \u0393. Smaller histogram-based entropy might be due to insufficient sampling in this disperse regime. (II) At mid-range \u0393, histogram-based entropy is remarkably higher than the 2D configurational estimate. This is possible because the histogram-based estimate also includes membrane contributions. In this regime, the increased entropy suggests new microstates available through amenable membrane configurations. This also perfectly matches our observation of the dominance of entropic interactions for this range of surface concentrations. (III) At high \u0393, histogram-based entropy falls significantly lower than the pure configurational estimate, highlighting the fact that stable clustered configurations in this regime prevent the exploration of combinatorial configuration possibilities. Lowered entropy must be compensated by favorable energetic interactions (Fig. 2D).\nUsing the differential form dG = \u2212SdT+Ad\u03b3+\u00b5pdNp, where \u03b3 and A are the membrane tension and surface area, and Np and \u00b5p are copy number and chemical potential of the bound proteins, a Maxwell relation can be written as, (\n\u2202S\n\u2202Np ) \u03b3 = \u2212 ( \u2202\u00b5p \u2202T ) \u03b3\n(3)\nThus, positive slope in the entropy-concentration plot of Fig. 2F means the chemical potential decreasing with temperature. Referring to the usual temperature dependence of entropic forces (e.g. Eq. (2)), this is equivalent to the increase in attractive entropic interactions.\nDirect estimation of membrane entropy\nTo gain better insight into the origin of the observed entropy variations, we directly estimate the entropy of the membrane from simulation trajectories, and observe its behavior as a function of protein aggregation. Generally, it is non-trivial to assign a quasi-equilibrium timedependent estimate of entropy to a dynamical system [55\u201357]. Out main interest here is to observe the qualitative behavior of the entropy functional, and thus, we approach this simply via coarse-grained Gibbs entropy,\nS = \u2212k \u2211 j pj log(pj) (4)\nwhere the summation is carried out on all the states in an arbitrarily discretized configuration space and pj \u2019s\ncorrespond to the probability of the system being found in the j-th discrete cell. We limit our measurement to two aspects of the entropy in this system: (i) \u2206Sh, the entropy assigned to membrane undulations, where the discretization is done in the Fourier space of fluctuation modes (Fig. 3A), and (ii) \u2206Sn, the orientational entropy of the tilt field, where the probability of states is measured based on P2 (cos \u03b8), where P2 (x) is the Legendre polynomial of order 2, and \u03b8 is the local tilt angle (Figs. 1A and 3A). Counting the states, respectively based on the discretized fluctuation spectrum and the order parameter distribution, comprises a specific coarse-graining which renders the numerical values of the entropies thus obtained not comparable to other estimates. On the other hand, this specific accumulation of microstates results in sufficient sampling for each bin, even in a time-dependent evolving sense, when sampling is performed over sliding temporal windows (further details in Methods section \u201cEntropy estimation\u201d).\nWe observe that \u2206Sh only increases with protein aggregation in the lowest concentration of \u0393 = 2.10 nmol m\u22122 (Figs. 3C and 3D). When higher concentrations are imposed (\u0393 = 4.19 and 8.29 nmol m\u22122), this entropy decreases with aggregation. The decrease becomes more drastic with higher concentrations (Figs. 3C and 3D). On the other hand, the tilt-field entropy, \u2206Sn, tends to increase with aggregation, independent of concentration (Figs. 3C and 3D). The slope of its increase is also directly proportional to surface concentration (Fig. 3D). Interestingly, with both \u2206Sh and \u2206Sn, when \u0393 = 8.29 nmol m\u22122, we observe a clear separation of low and high entropy states (Fig. 3C)."

This model predicts a complex aggregation behavior for these peripheral proteins based on their stiffness and surface concentration [54].\nUsing a liquid mixture model, we quantified the effective pairwise potential of membrane-mediated interactions between proteins. We observe a rather longrange attraction with a strength depending on protein stiffness. Surface concentration of particles has an effect on the pairwise interactions, especially when the pair of particles are not nearest neighbors (Fig. 1D). This suggests that multi-body effects are present. Idealized repulsion and attraction potentials originating from continuum models (Eqs. 1 and 2) are not applicable to the complex interaction potential observed. On the other hand, multi-body effects limit the applicability of the pairwise interaction model altogether. Application of more elaborate data-driven models to these interactions would thus be promising in gaining better insight as well as extrapolating the dynamics to larger timescales.

(D) Undulation and tilt-field entropies as functions of the reaction coordinate q (colors correspond to the legend of panel (B)).\n7 believe deep learning, especially via graph convolutional neural networks (GCNN) holds the key to such an investigation [58, 59].\nWe obtained entropy landscapes along a continuous aggregation reaction coordinate, and showed that entropy only increases with aggregation when the surface concentration is below a threshold. Comparison of mean entropy as a function of surface concentration revealed that only for concentrations below this threshold the estimated entropy can surpasses the 2D configurational entropy of proteins as indistinguishable particles on the membrane. We thus conclude that while entropic forces originated from membrane fluctuations exist and are apparently responsible for bringing proteins together in the low-concentration regime, they are overshadowed at higher concentrations. At high concentrations, there are enough random encounters between particles on the surface of the membrane that the energy minima due to collective membrane deformation become more influential.\nTo further corroborate these findings, we took an independent measurement via direct estimation of coarsegrained Gibbs entropy. We looked at the entropy of membrane undulation modes as well as orientational entropy of the tilt field. We found out that the generally larger undulation entropies point to the same trend as the histogram-based estimates. We also observed that the orientational entropy of the tilt field always favors aggregation. It is imaginable that in a model with a higher resolution representation of lipids, this entropy have a more pronounced effect. But in our model, and with the admittedly arbitrary partitioning of configuration space, the undulation entropies seem to be always dominant in magnitude, and resisting the aggregation at high concentrations.\nWe believe the dynamic membrane + protein model and the detailed analyses presented here can be greatly beneficial in investigating different scenarios for membrane-mediated collective action. Ever-advancing super-resolution microscopy [60] and optical spectroscopy methods [61] make it possible to look at organization of membrane-associated proteins in unprecedented details, while resolving membrane fluctuations at nanometer/microsecond range. This opens the door to direct quantitative comparison with experimental observation of membrane-mediated effects, and will pave the way for unraveling and controlling the underlying mechanisms."

            "text": "Particle-based model of membrane and peripheral proteins\nThe particle-based model of membrane and bound peripheral proteins used in this study is fully described in [54]. This model is an extension of our previously es-\ntablished dynamic membrane model [50\u201352]. We have used a lattice parameter of 6.5 nm for all the particles, comparable with the diameter of the STxB protein. We use a force field for describing nearest neighbor interactions in this model which allows a local masking where peripheral proteins are bound (Fig. 1A). We have utilized the combined energy density of membrane and the protein in conjunction with parameter-space optimization to obtain the global force field parameters [54] (Fig. 1A).\nStatistical mechanics of liquid mixtures\nWe assume rotational isotropy in the 2D fluid, and consider the pair-correlation function between the species \u03b1 and \u03b2 as g\u03b1\u03b2 (r). Defining h\u03b1\u03b2 (r) = g\u03b1\u03b2 (r)\u2212 1, the so-called direct correlation function, c\u03b1\u03b2 (r), is defined implicitly [62],\nh\u03b1\u03b2 (r) = c\u03b1\u03b2 (r) + \u2211 \u03b3 \u0393\u03b3 \u222b c\u03b1\u03b3 (s)h\u03b3\u03b2 (|r\u2212 s|) ds (5)\nwhere \u0393\u2019s denote surface densities.

(5) translates to\nH\u0303 (q) = C\u0303 (q) + C\u0303 (q) H\u0303 (q) (6)\nwhere H\u0303 and C\u0303 are 2\u00d7 2 matrices with elements H\u0303\u03b1\u03b2 = (\u0393\u03b1\u0393\u03b2) 1 2 h\u0303\u03b1\u03b2 and C\u0303\u03b1\u03b2 = (\u0393\u03b1\u0393\u03b2) 1 2 c\u0303\u03b1\u03b2 and h\u0303\u03b1\u03b2 and c\u0303\u03b1\u03b2 are two-dimensional Fourier transforms of h\u03b1\u03b2 and c\u03b1,\u03b2 . Eq. (6) is formally known as the Ornstein-Zernike relation [62, 63]. Several \u201cclosure\u201d relations are available which tie h\u03b1\u03b2 , c\u03b1\u03b2 , and g\u03b1\u03b2 via a pairwise potential u\u03b1\u03b2 between \u03b1 and \u03b2. We have employed the convoluted hypernetted-chain (CHNC) relation [64],\nc\u03b1\u03b2 (r) = h\u03b1\u03b2 (r)\u2212 ln g\u03b1\u03b2 (r)\u2212 u\u03b1\u03b2 (r)\nkT (7)\nThe procedure for obtaining the potentials umm, ump, and most importantly, upp, is as follows: we calculate discretized estimates of the three pair correlation functions, gmm (r), gmp (r), and gpp (r), from the simulation trajectories, and substitute numerically obtained 2D Fourier transforms into Eq. (6) to obtain c\u03b1\u03b2 \u2019s and subsequently u\u03b1\u03b2 \u2019s from Eq. (7)."

Because of the fact\n8 the implementation of the masked force field only modifies the interaction potential without changing the number of particles, we make the assumption that the Hamiltonian is biased as H = H0 + \u03be f (q), with \u03be proportional to the surface concentration. Based on this assumption, the multiple histogram method of Ferrenberg and Swendsen [65] (which is the precursor to the well-known Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM) [65, 66]) can readily be applied to combine the histograms from different simulations.\nWe assume that each simulation, in which a different number of particles have been tagged as proteins, is biased with a Hamiltonian of the form H = H0 + \u03be f (q). A justification for this assumption is given in [54]. We have chosen polynomials of degree 4 as the function f (q), and have fitted to randomly sub-sampled energy data to obtain an error estimate. Application of multiple histogram reweighting yields the free energy landscape along q for different values of \u03be, which correlate with surface density of proteins. Once the free energy change, \u2206G, is available, we can estimate the entropy chage as,\n\u2206S = k lnZ (q) + \u2206\u3008H\u3009 T = \u2206\u3008H\u3009 \u2212\u2206G T (9)\nwhere Z (q) is the isothermal-isotension partition function.\nFor estimating the two dimensional configurational entropy of proteins spattered on the membrane surface, we have simply assumed that they can occupy any of the available sites on the particle-based membrane (Fig. 1A). A simple combinatorial assessment followed by the\nStirling\u2019s formula yields,\nS2D k = ln ( N Np ) \u2248 N ln ( N\nN \u2212Np\n) \u2212Np ln ( Np\nN \u2212Np ) (10) where N and Np are the total number of particles in the upper leaflet and the number of proteins, respectively.\nWe have obtained the undulation entropy, \u2206Sh, by first mapping the height of membrane particles to a regular 2D grid using bilinear interpolation, i.e. to get a regular sampling of the height function, h (x, y). Following a spatial fast Fourier transform for each time frame, we have discretized h\u0303 (k) in the frequency domain based on the length of the wave-vector, k (Fig. 3A) and obtained a sliding-window estimate of the probability distribution from the histogram of states. For the tilt-field entropy, \u2206Sn, the discretization is achieved in real space based on samples of the orientational order parameter P2 (cos \u03b8) (Fig. 3A). For both entropies, point values has been estimated on sliding-window samples over a 0.5 ms temporal window."
