There is consensus that IQ contributes to this\nheterogeneity as well as complicates diagnostics and treatment planning. In this study,\nwe assessed the accuracy of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS/2)\nin the whole and IQ-defined subsamples, and analyzed if the ADOS/2 accuracy may\nbe increased by the application of machine learning (ML) algorithms that processed\nadditional information including the IQ level.\nMethods: The study included 1,084 individuals: 440 individuals with ASD (with a mean\nIQ level of 3.3 \u00b1 1.5) and 644 individuals without ASD (with a mean IQ level of 3.2 \u00b1 1.2).\nWe applied and analyzed Random Forest (RF) and Decision Tree (DT) to the ADOS/2 data,\ncompared their accuracy to ADOS/2 cutoff algorithms, and examinedmost relevant items\nto distinguish between ASD and Non-ASD. In sum, we included 49 individual features,\nindependently of the applied ADOS module.\nResults: In DT analyses, we observed that for the decision ASD/Non-ASD, solely one to\nfour items are sufficient to differentiate between groups with high accuracy. In addition,\nin sub-cohorts of individuals with (a) below (IQ level \u22654)/ID and (b) above average\nintelligence (IQ level \u2264 2), the ADOS/2 cutoff showed reduced accuracy. This reduced\naccuracy results in (a) a three times higher risk of false-positive diagnoses or (b) a 1.7\nhigher risk for false-negative diagnoses; both errors could be significantly decreased by\nthe application of the alternative ML algorithms.\nConclusions: Using ML algorithms showed that a small set of ADOS/2 items could\nhelp clinicians to more accurately detect ASD in clinical practice across all IQ levels and\nto increase diagnostic accuracy especially in individuals with below and above average\nIQ level.\nKeywords: autism spectrum disorders, IQ, intellectual disability, ADOS, machine learning, diagnostic, intelligence"

            "text": "Public awareness about autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is steadily increasing (1, 2). This is also reflected by the growing number of children, adolescents, and adults who use diagnostic services in outpatient clinics for ASD. Although, in the eyes of the public, the term autism is often associated with special talents and abilities (3), creating a somewhat distorted picture of the disorder, the larger part of the group of autistic people shows intellectual abilities below the average of the general population. Fombone (4) reviewed 20 epidemiological studies of ASD published from 1966 to 2001 and summarized that the median percentage of individuals with ASD and cognitive impairment was 70% (range 40\u2013100%). More recent epidemiological studies reported that about 56% of people with ASD have an IQ < 70 (5) or 31% of children with ASD are classified in the range of an intellectual disability (ID), 25% in the borderline range (IQ 71\u201385), and 44% have IQ scores in the average to above average range (i.e., IQ > 85) (6). This heterogeneity of data about IQ in ASD is in line with statements that IQ might be the source of heterogeneity of ASD as a heterogeneous (group of) disorder(s) (7\u20139).\nThe IQ is associated with the individual level of functioning and\u2014particularly in ASD\u2014with the ability to acquire and apply specific skills in order to handle typical everyday situations, to plan and act with foresight and to be flexible and adaptive to changing environmental conditions (9, 10). Knowledge regarding the individual IQ is thus important to gain more knowledge about the functionality of the person with ASD. This, in turn, is relevant for both diagnostic accuracy and the treatment planning and success.\nIt has been observed that ASD symptom measures such as the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS), the Autism Diagnostic Interview Revised (ADI-R), and Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) capturemuchmore than just the pure symptoms of ASD: increased scores may reflect rather additional impairments than ASD-related social communicative deficits and repetitive behaviors alone (11). IQ-related particularities increase the risk for drawing incorrect conclusions about etiological and phenotypic relationships (11). Such incorrect conclusions may result in false-negative or false-positive decisions in ASD diagnosis.\nWithin the so-called gold standard clinical diagnostics for ASD, a standardized interview conducted with the caregiver of the individual (ADI-R), a standardized behavioral observation of the individual itself (ADOS/2), a differential diagnostic examination, and an IQ testing are included. Based on all this information, individuals are categorized according to the psychiatric multiaxial schema (12, 13). Within this schema, individuals will be categorized in six axes: (1) psychiatric syndromes; (2) circumscribed developmental delay; (3) intellectual level or mental retardation; (4) somatic symptomatology; (5) associated current abnormal psychosocial circumstances; and (6) global assessment of psychosocial stressors and adaptive functioning. With respect to axis 3, the intellectual level, a rough categorization based on the tested or estimated IQ is made: level 1: IQ > 129, level 2: IQ = 115\u2013129, level 3: IQ = 85\u2013114, level 4: IQ = 70\u201384, level 5: IQ = 50\u201369,\nlevel 6: IQ = 25\u201349, level 7: IQ = 20\u201334, and level 8: IQ < 20 (13).\nAlthough the ADOS/2 offers good sensitivity and specificity values (14, 15), there are frequent cases in which the diagnosis is either missed (false negative) or given incorrectly (false positive)\u2014false particularly in the retrospective consideration of changes in phenomenology and thus diagnoses during development over several years (16). There are several potential reasons facilitating false-positive or false-negative cases, like under-resourced familial or educational environment, presence of only subtle ASD symptoms, and presence or absence of coexisting or differential diagnoses [e.g., anxiety disorder (17), ADHD (18), or psychosis (19)]. In addition, high intelligence enabling a partial compensation of ASD-related social and communicative difficulties may be an influencing factor (20). Although individuals with ASD may benefit from high intelligence by potentially higher compensation abilities, it was also observed that individuals with ASD with above average IQ perform low in domains of facial and emotional identification, visual pattern recognition, and verbal working memory (7). Thus, individuals with ASD with above average IQ also show impairments, which may be targeted in clinical assessment and treatment. Individuals with low intelligence are also susceptible to ASD misidentification\u2014either because an intellectual disability (ID) diagnosis overshadows ASD symptoms or because cognitive impairments are falsely interpreted as ASD (21\u201323). As the accuracy of psychiatric diagnoses affects both the preferred therapy choice and the respective outcome (24), and implications from obtaining a lifelong diagnosis such as ASD can be severe, the diagnostic accuracy should be as high as possible. Therefore, clinicians should be aware of specific individual characteristics, which are concomitant with different levels of IQ and which may lead to increased or decreased ADOS/2 scores (16).\nThe present study aimed to (1) analyze the accuracy of the ADOS/2 algorithm by comparing the reaching and exceeding of the ADOS/2 cutoffs with the BEC ASD diagnosis also for sub-cohorts defined by different IQ levels. (2) In addition, we investigated whether these accuracies can be increased by applying data-driven machine learning (ML) approaches that processed additional features including the IQ level. Finally, (3) with the help of ML approaches, we aimed to identify which of the considered features are most important to discriminate accurately between participants with and without a BEC ASD diagnosis to focus clinicians\u2019 attention on features that best distinguish between ASD and Non-ASD, so that the most accurate, economical, and comprehensive classification of each individual is achieved."

Therefore, the recoded data from all ADOS modules have been combined to one data set before being processed by the ML algorithms. The intention was to increase robustness of the model estimation by increasing the number of samples available for training a single model. Hence, a single model is trained on the whole data instead of training four module-specific models on the modules\u2019 respective data only.\nIn order to be able to process all individuals congruently, similar labeled (and thus assumingly corresponding) items from different modules have been identified and were arranged accordingly; missing items were filled with\u22125. This value was chosen, as it is clearly out of range, allowing the algorithms to use the information whether data were collected or not. In the present paper, the naming of the items used is listed in module order, i.e., module 1/module 2/module 3/module 4. Furthermore, the naming refers to the ADOS convention: indication of initial letters (A\u2013D) for the respective dimension plus a number (indicating the temporal sequence of the item). There are items that occur in all four modules (N = 17), items that occur in three modules (modules 2\u20134,N = 3), and items that occur in two modules (modules 1 and 2, N = 6; modules 3 and 4, N = 7). If items do not appear in all modules, they are marked with a \u201c-\u201d in the appropriate place to indicate that they do not appear in that module.\nTo offer two examples: (a) item \u201cB3/B2/B2/B2\u201d indicates the item \u201csocially directed facial expression,\u201d which is item B3 in module 1 and item B2 in modules 2 to 4. In addition, it is also visible that this item is included in all four modules. In contrast, (b) item \u201c-/-/B6/B7\u201d indicates the item \u201csocial insight,\u201d which is part of modules 3 (B6) and 4 (B7). In modules 1 and 2, however, this item does not occur and is therefore coded as\u22125 for all participants of these modules.\nBesides the items, all potentially relevant additional information that is collected during standard diagnostic procedure was provided to the ML algorithms, i.e., the applied ADOS module, IQ level, age of the individual, sex of the individual, and presence or absence of an ID. In total, the number of features processed by the ML algorithms summed up to 49 for each subject, independently of the applied ADOS module. All individual features can be identified in Figure 4 in the Results section.\nThese features were processed by decision trees (DT) with the aim to discriminate subjects with a BEC ASD diagnosis from subjects without as accurate as possible. DTs are simple models that are inherently interpretable due to their flowchartlike structure where nodes are representing categorical tests that are applied to individual features.\nDTs are grown node by node, always aiming to find a condition and a factor that split the data in homogeneous groups of individuals with ASD and individuals without ASD. The inhomogeneity (or impurity) of a group can be measured, e.g., with the entropy or the gini-index of the depended variable, i.e., the diagnosis variable. The reduction of the impurity measure (or impurity decrease) is used during training for choosing\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 3 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 826043\nappropriate features and conditions for each node (27). Here, the reduction of the impurity measure is defined as the difference of the impurity before the split and the average impurity of the two samples after the split, weighted with their respective number of samples in the training data.\nWhile DTs are natively interpretable, they can be sensitive to minor changes in input data and often suffer from suboptimal classification performance (27). To overcome these limitations, outputs from multiple DTs can be combined, forming an RF. Usually, each tree is trained on randomly sampled subsets of the original data. While RFs are more powerful and typically superior in terms of stability and accuracy, their complexity comes at the cost of reduced interpretability of their decision process."

As -/B10/B9/B11 is not part of module 1, it is therefore\u22125 for all participants from this module. As a consequence, the DT classifies all participants from module 1 with inconspicuous rating for B3/B2/B2/B2 as Non-ASD (N = 22, 9% received ASD diagnosis).\nIn contrast, if B3/B2/B2/B2 is conspicuous (value 1\u20133), the likelihood to diagnose ASD is 63% (37% receive no ASD diagnosis).

Finally, we examined discriminating features for distinguishing between ASD and Non-ASD based on these ML algorithms (aim 3).\nTo analyze the accuracy of the ADOS in different IQ levels, we initially looked at the IQ distribution of our sample and observed that solely 8.6% of the individuals with ASD have a coexisting diagnosis of ID, which is considerably low in comparison to former studies. For example, Baio et al. (6) reported 31% of children with ASD to be classified in the range of an ID. However, 28.4% of the individuals with ASD of our sample had an IQ< 70, which is closer to the reported values of the epidemiological study by Baio et al. (6). In addition, we observed that 40% of our sample of individuals with ASD had an IQ level above average (IQ > 115), which is higher than in former studies (6, 33).

These accuracies are generally in line with recent studies from our groups and others (34, 35). Also, higher accuracies have been reported [e.g., Stroth et al. (36), who even observed an accuracy of 98.27% and 98.66% in ADOS Modules 2 and 3], probably due to module-specific analyses resulting in more homogeneity of the analyzed sample. Only aminor increase in total accuracy of 1.21% could be observed for RFs compared to the ADOS/2 cutoff.\nSub-cohorts\u2014Influence of IQ All three algorithms (DT, RF, and ADOS/2 cutoff) are coherent in their performance in patient sub-cohorts with different IQ levels. Especially for individuals with an average IQ level (IQ: 85\u2013114), no significant differences in performance could be observed. For individuals with below average IQ and ID, as compared to individuals with average IQ, false-positive diagnoses were significantly increased by the factor 2\u20133, when the ADOS/2 cutoff is applied. This confirms our hypothesis as well as the clinical impression (namely: the ADOS/2 algorithm is potentially overestimating ASD symptoms in sub-cohorts with very low cognitive abilities) and negatively influences the validity of the final BEC. This higher rate of false-positive diagnoses is alarming, given that 38% of our sample of individuals with ASD have a below average IQ. Previously, a false-positive diagnosis in individuals with a below average IQ has been suggested to be less devastating than a false-negative diagnosis of individuals with ASD (37). However, Kamp-Becker et al. were rather critical of this statement, arguing that a cutoff resulting in a falsepositive ASD diagnosis in individuals with developmental delay is\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 7 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 826043\nrather confusing in clinical practice, affecting both the individual with ASD and his social environment. As an alternative, the authors advocated the introduction of two cutoffs: a higher threshold for \u201chigher specificity\u201d and a lower threshold for \u201chigher sensitivity\u201d (38). Somewhat in line with the potential benefit of two ADOS/2 cutoffs, we observed that the falsepositive rate in both individuals with below average IQ and with below average IQ plus ID can be reduced by applying alternatives to the ADOS/2 cutoff, as shown here with DTs or RFs. However, this increase in specificity comes at the cost of a lower sensitivity, i.e., an increase in the false-negative rate (which was not statistically significant).\nIn addition to the described high rate of false-positive diagnoses in individuals with below average IQ levels and with below average IQ plus ID, we detected a significantly increased number of false negatives (i.e., individuals with ASD, who did not reach ADOS/2 cutoff but have the BEC diagnosis ASD) for individuals with above average IQ levels (IQ \u2265 115) as compared to individuals with average IQ levels. This amount of false negative diagnoses is also concerning, given the finding that 40% of our ASD sample have an above average IQ level. However, the amount of individuals with an above average IQ level differs with respect to age and applied module. While, for example, within M4, 65.3% of individuals with ASD and a mean age of 26.07 years \u00b1 12.28 have an above average IQ, in M3, this is true for 44.6% (mean age of 10.06 years \u00b1 2.52). Within M2, solely 9.8% of individuals with ASD have an above average IQ (mean age of 8.15 years \u00b1 4.03), and within M1, 1.5% (mean age of 6.33 years \u00b1\n3.27). Thus, especially for individuals who were diagnosed later in life (about 10 years and older), this observation may be explained by better adaptive performance during the diagnostic assessment and more efficient as well as compensatory strategies, like camouflaging, to mask or hide social difficulties (39\u201341). However, this is a post-hoc assumption and should be investigated in further studies.\nNevertheless, the increase in false positives for individuals with below average IQ levels as well as the increase in false negatives for individuals with above average IQ levels was independent of the algorithm applied in the present study but strongest in the ADOS/2 algorithm. As the BEC diagnosis of ASD is dependent not only on ADOS/2 results but also on the clinical impression as well as on further diagnostics, individuals with similar ADOS/2 results can receive different diagnoses. From this point of view, conspicuous behaviors during ADOS/2 assessment situations are seemingly not sufficiently specific for distinguishing between individuals with below average IQ plus ID and individuals with ASD, which is in line with recent research (42). However, further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis."

The relevance of this item within M1 was previously confirmed (34), but also somewhat contradicts findings from our group and another group (36, 43). Moreover, for M2\u20134, the likelihood to exclude ASD is even higher, by adding the Item \u201cquality of social responses\u201d (-/B10/B9/B11). The high relevance of that item was previously confirmed for all three Modules (2, 3, 5) by others (34, 44) and our group (35, 36).\nThese insights from data-driven ML models are consistent with the features that contribute to the calculation of the ADOS/2 cutoff: The four features with the highest average impurity decrease are relevant for the calculation of the ADOS/2 cutoff in all modules. Furthermore, all nine top-rated RF features contribute to the ADOS/2 cutoff in two or more modules.\nNevertheless, ADOS/2 cutoff relevant items differ between the four modules. Offering post-hoc suggestions to optimize the performance of module-specific cutoff calculation is thus difficult, since we could not analyze the data within their respective module. In this regard, a cautious indication, still requiring more testing, could be that the items B10 (Quality of social responses) and A5 (Conversation) are possibly underestimated within M2 and might be considered to be additionally included in the cutoff calculation. The same is true for item B4 (shared enjoyment of interaction) within M4 (compare Figure 3).\nOn the other hand, there are items included in the ADOS/2 cutoff that ML rated as less relevant. For some items that only occur in one or two modules, relevance is likely underestimated in the ML models for statistical reasons. In contrast, it is evident that \u201cD\u201d items in particular (which would have the necessary power due to their cross-module occurrence) seem to be less relevant for the differentiation between ASD and Non-ASD, at least as listed within the RF results. Only D4 (\u201cunusual repetitive interests or stereotyped behaviors\u201d) appears relevant within the DT. If this item (in the drawn DT path sequence) is conspicuous, the calculated likelihood for ASD is 88.9% instead of 16.7% when the item is inconspicuous.\nImportantly, features like age and IQ level also rank in the upper third of the most important features, suggesting a more direct influence on ASD diagnostic than it was apparent up to now. Although age is included in the ADOS/2 cutoff algorithm of M2, this focus is missing for the remaining modules. Moreover, IQ level is not taken into account in any of the four modules. In sum, especially with respect to the high amount of false positives (in case of individuals with below average IQ and ID) or else of false negatives (in case of individuals with above average IQ), we recommend clinicians to be aware of these potential confounding features in the diagnostic process. Based on the present data, it can be suggested that going through the short DT pathways, to reinsure the decision for or against ASD, may decrease the risk of false positives and false negatives in individuals with below and above average IQ levels remarkably. However, it is relevant to keep in mind that, in addition to or in interaction with IQ, further factors may influence the complex diagnostic process, including other differential or comorbid diagnoses (17,\n18, 36, 45), female gender (46), parental psychiatric diagnoses (47), aspects of healthcare supply (48, 49), and experience of the diagnostician (50). Further, since IQ and language are observed to account for the heterogeneity in ASD and the variability in diagnostic and therapeutically outcomes, it appears relevant to consider also developmental trajectories of autistic symptom severity and adaptive functioning (51). For example, within analyses of the longitudinal EU-AIMS project, it was observed that higher age, lower IQ, and increased severity in (parent rated) social communication symptoms were predictive for lower adaptive functioning (52). Thus, the interplay between IQ, age, and symptom expression as well as their possible trajectories may be considered as well, if risks for false negatives or positives during ASD diagnostics were attempted to be reduced. However it was also concluded that individualized interventions need to focus on both aspects (symptom severity and adaptive functioning), since improvement in one domain does not ensure improvement in the other (51). In addition, even severely impaired children may improve substantially, so that they may enter adolescence with severity scores that are comparable to high functioning children. Prerequisite for this developmental trajectory is not to have an ID and to have a more educated, non-minority mother (53). In summary, the present and recent findings (7, 52) underline the high relevance of taking the IQ into account for the assessment of ASD symptomatology as well as for statements about course/prognosis and thus individual developmental trajectories and opportunities (54)."

            "text": "DTs are known to be very sensitive to changes in the training data: Minor modifications in the data provided for training can result in different trees. Therefore, in general, care has to be taken when drawing conclusions about the importance of attributes from DT. However, considering that the RF consists of DTs trained on randomly sub-sampled data, the impurity decrease measure can be regarded as a more robust measure of item importance. As the relevant features derived from the impurity decrease in the RF (Figure 3) are widely consistent with the relevant features obtained from the DT shown in Figure 2, the latter can be considered representative for similar data sets. As our analyses were applied in a cross-ADOS-module approach, further research is necessary to confirm the data as well as the drawn pathway within individual ADOS modules. A further limitation is that the ADOS/2 was part of the state-of-the-art diagnostic approach. Thus, the coincidence of ASD diagnosis and the ADOS/2 cutoff exceedance is possibly circular, confounding the results."

            "text": "In general, accuracies to predict BEC diagnosis of ASD yes vs. no between ADOS/2 cutoff and ML models are comparable. However, within sub-cohort analyses, i.e., individuals with below and above average IQ levels, the ADOS/2 algorithm was less accurate, resulting in 3 times higher risk for a false-positive ASD diagnosis in individuals with ID as well as 1.7 times higher risk for a false-negative ASD diagnosis in individuals with an\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 9 March 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 826043\nabove average IQ. This may be circumvented or decreased to the accuracy of individuals with average IQs by following the presented DT pathways, which could serve as a brief screening and as a solid decision-making basis for a subsequent allencompassing diagnosis."
