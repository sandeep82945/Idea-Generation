Extension to Spatial RD Designs: The paper acknowledges its limitation to random samples and excludes spatial RD designs due to their theoretical and conceptual complexity. A future research direction could involve developing an extension of the multivariate local-polynomial estimator to spatial RD designs. This would entail tackling the unique challenges posed by spatial data, such as spatial autocorrelation and the multidimensional nature of spatial boundaries, and could significantly enhance the applicability of RD designs in geographical and environmental studies.

High-dimensional RD Designs: While the paper focuses on RD designs with at most two dimensions, there is a growing interest in RD designs that involve more complex, high-dimensional settings. Future research could explore the practical implementation and performance of multivariate local-polynomial estimators in higher-dimensional RD designs. This could include developing strategies for dimensionality reduction that preserve the heterogeneity of treatment effects without sacrificing the estimatorâ€™s asymptotic properties.

Integration with Machine Learning Techniques: The paper mentions the potential for incorporating covariates through machine learning devices for efficiency gains. A future research avenue could systematically integrate machine learning techniques with multivariate RD estimation to handle high-dimensional covariates efficiently. This could involve leveraging machine learning algorithms for feature selection, bias correction, and estimation of treatment effects, particularly in complex datasets where traditional methods struggle.

Theoretical Developments in Asymptotic Theory: The paper introduces a novel asymptotic theory for multivariate local-polynomial estimators with dimension-specific bandwidths. Future research could delve deeper into the theoretical aspects, exploring the conditions under which the proposed estimator remains asymptotically valid in more complex settings. This might include examining the estimator's robustness to different types of irregularities in the boundary or the treatment assignment mechanism.

Policy Implication Studies in Diverse Fields: Finally, the practical application of the proposed estimator to uncover heterogeneity in treatment effects offers rich possibilities for policy research across various domains. Future studies could apply this estimator to a wide range of policy interventions (beyond scholarship programs), such as healthcare, public finance, and environmental regulations, to provide nuanced insights into the effectiveness of policies across different population subgroups and conditions. This could help in designing more tailored and effective policy interventions.
