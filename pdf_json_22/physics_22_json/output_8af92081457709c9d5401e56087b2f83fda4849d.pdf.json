            "text": "One of the primary foci of the nuclear physics community in the last three decades has been to discern the origin of the proton\u2019s spin in terms of its quark and gluon, collectively partonic, constituents. Efforts to resolve the dynamical origin of the proton\u2019s spin date to the earliest measurements of the spin-dependent structure functions describing polarized inclusive deep-inelastic scattering (DIS) cross sections [1], which, remarkably, found that the total quark spin contributes only marginally to the total spin of the nucleon. The bulk of the information concerning the quark helicity parton distribution functions (PDFs) is deduced from polarized DIS data, where, for a parity-conserving interaction the hadronic tensor is described in terms of the polarized structure functions g1 ( x,Q2 ) and\ng2 ( x,Q2 ) [2\u20135]. Within the parton model [6\u20138], the g1 ( x,Q2 ) structure function is readily interpreted as a linear combination of the quark and anti-quark helicity PDFs, appearing often in the literature as gq/q\u0304 (x) or \u2206q/q\u0304 (x). These PDFs quantify the helicity asymmetry of quarks and anti-quarks, respectively, within a hadronic state of definite helicity. The first determination of the polarized PDFs of the nucleon from a global analysis of longitudinally polarized DIS, SIDIS, and early RHIC data, deemed DSSV08, was presented\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 6\nin refs. [9, 10]. A similar set of polarized data was considered by the NNPDF collaboration in ref. [11], and extended shortly thereafter in ref. [12] to include contemporary polarized hadron collider data for inclusive jet and W -production from the STAR [13\u201316] and PHENIX [17, 18] experiments at RHIC. Although the inclusion of the STAR and PHENIX data in NNPDF\u2019s updated helicity PDF set, called NNPDFpol1.1, did not extend the kinematic coverage of the helicity PDFs exposed by the polarized DIS data, the data did further constrain helicity PDF combinations accessible from polarized DIS alone and provided insight on novel helicity PDF combinations, such as \u2206u\u0304. In particular, the first Mellin moments of the polarized quark and anti-quark distributions were found to confirm that the nucleon receives only a small component of its spin from the intrinsic spin of its quark constituents, although the precision of the polarized moments were limited by extrapolation into the unmeasured small-x regime. Contemporaneously, the DSSV08 polarized PDF analysis was extended in ref. [19] to include hadroproduction data of neutral pions and jets from proton-proton collisions at RHIC, where the STAR [16] & PHENIX [20] and COMPASS [21, 22] data were considered. The updated polarized PDF set from the DSSV08 authors, deemed DSSV14, revealed, for the first time, evidence for a nonvanishing gluon polarization in the proton for moderate momentum fractions [19]. Additional constraints on the quark helicity PDFs are provided by polarized semiinclusive DIS (SIDIS), but require simultaneous knowledge of the relevant fragmentation functions that characterize the emergence of an observed hadron(s) from the struck parton. While NNPDFpol1.1 did not include light-quark SIDIS data, whose structure functions factorize into a convolution of the helicity PDFs and non-perturbative fragmentation functions, the Jefferson Lab Angular Momentum (JAM) collaboration performed the first simultaneous global analysis of polarized DIS and SIDIS data at NLO [23]. The analysis, denoted JAM17 by the authors, leveraged e+e\u2212 single-inclusive annihilation (SIA) data to provide an independent constraint on the fragmentation functions present in the factorized SIDIS cross sections included from COMPASS [21, 24] and HERMES [25]. The inclusion of the SIDIS data, for example, was found to lead to \u2206s+ \u2261 \u2206s+\u2206s to become positive for x \u223c 0.1. Recently the JAM17 analysis was extended to include the latest polarized W -production data from STAR at RHIC, while many of the assumed flavor symmetries and PDF positivity constraints were relaxed [26]. The resulting PDF set, deemed JAM22, supports a nonzero polarized sea asymmetry of the proton as well as a nonzero contribution to its spin from light anti-quarks. Evidently the quark helicity PDFs are less constrained than their unpolarized counterparts, thus warranting continued studies from first-principles lattice QCD. As DIS, semi-inclusive, and exclusive processes, provide information about the nonperturbative structure of hadrons encoded in PDFs, one might hope that PDFs could also be calculated from first-principles lattice QCD. The Euclidean metric signature of lattice QCD, however, precludes any direct calculation of PDFs. Some of the earliest attempts to bypass this challenge sought to isolate the hadronic tensor [27, 28] and forward Compton amplitude [29] directly from suitable Euclidean correlation functions. Within the last decade, renewed interest within the lattice community is generally attributed to the realization that the correlations of space-like separated partons within a boosted hadron, when Fourier transformed to momentum space, share the same infrared physics as the conven-\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 6\ntional light-cone PDFs [30]. The resulting quasi-distributions are amenable to calculation using lattice QCD, while their distinct ultraviolet structures relative to the light-cone PDFs can be computed perturbatively. This forms the basis of Large Momentum Effective Theory (LaMET) [31], a momentum-space factorization, akin to the QCD factorization of hadronic scattering cross sections, that connects the quasi- and light-cone distributions. Determinations of helicity quark PDFs from quasi-distributions computed in lattice QCD include the flavor non-singlet [32\u201335] and singlet [36, 37] cases, as well as careful accounting for numerous sources of systematic error in such extractions [38]. Despite the challenges inherent to the extraction of the x-dependent PDFs from lattice QCD, there has been considerable progress in the resolution of the flavor-separated quark and gluon contributions to the nucleon spin. The former are the first Mellin moments of the flavor-singlet quark helicity PDFs and are accessible from matrix elements of certain local operators. Advancements in computing infrastructure and algorithm design, including stochastic [39] and truncated solver methods [40, 41], have enabled several recent physical pion mass, high-statistics calculations of the disconnected contributions needed to decompose the proton spin into contributions from its constituents. The first such calculation on a physical pion mass ensemble from the ETM Collaboration found the intrinsic quark spin to the proton to be 12\u2206\u03a3u+d+s ' 0.201 [42]. This result was subsequently verified by the \u03c7QCD collaboration [43], leveraging three 2 + 1 domain-wall fermion ensembles of varying pion masses and lattice spacings. Both results were found to be consistent with a phenomenological analysis of data from the COMPASS experiment, which found 0.13 . 12\u2206\u03a3 . 0.18 [44]. A study of 1 2\u2206\u03a3u+d+s by the PNDME collaboration across numerous 2 + 1 + 1 HISQ ensembles, with lattice spacing and pion mass as low as 0.06 fm and m\u03c0 \u223c 135MeV, respectively, later found 12\u2206\u03a3u+d+s \u223c 0.143. This result, entirely within the COMPASS bound, was observed to depend delicately on the chiral-continuum extrapolation of each disconnected contribution. The reader is directed to ref. [45] for a thorough account of recent progress. As the lattice community nears a decade of intense investigation of the light-cone structure of hadrons, considerable advancements in numerical reconstruction methods and theoretical formalisms, and the approaching Exascale frontier, promise to extend the impact of first-principles lattice QCD into regions largely unknown or poorly constrained from experiment. With this paradigm as the backdrop, it is imperative that all sources of systematic error in such a lattice QCD calculation are suitably accounted for. The reader is directed to refs. [46\u201348] for recent contemporary reviews on the state of the art in hadronic structure calculations from lattice QCD. The introduction of quasi-distributions and LaMET has led to many dedicated calculations of PDFs [27\u201334, 38, 48\u2013156], distributions amplitudes (DAs) [157\u2013163], generalized parton distributions (GPDs) [164\u2013168], and transverse momentum dependent distributions (TMDs) [169\u2013182]. An alternative framework [55], based on a short-distance factorization of the same lattice-calculated matrix elements utilized to construct quasi-distributions, offers complementary information on hadronic structure from lattice QCD. Within this short-distance factorization framework, the computed matrix elements induce a Lorentz decomposition into invariant amplitudes, or pseudo-distributions. The space-like matrix\n\u2013 3 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 6\nelements computed in lattice QCD are related to their associated light-cone analogs via a factorization theorem derived using the operator product expansion in a short-distance regime. In this manner the pseudo-distributions can be matched to their light-cone counterparts and the PDF obtained. The efficacy of the pseudo-distribution formalism and the distillation spatial smearing algorithm when applied in tandem to such structure studies was demonstrated in refs. [153, 154], wherein the flavor non-singlet unpolarized and transversity quark PDFs were isolated. The goal of this manuscript is to extend this union to include the isovector helicity quark PDFs, for both the CP-even and CP-odd varieties, thereby completing a first determination of the nucleon\u2019s leading-twist isovector quark PDFs using distillation and pseudo-distributions. The remainder of this manuscript is organized as follows. Section 2 begins with a recapitulation of the defining matrix element of the helicity quark PDF, which will expose the leading-twist invariant amplitudes one may hope to calculate using lattice QCD. Presentation of the coordinate space factorization, on which we will depend, will round out this section. The extracted bare nucleon matrix elements sensitive to the helicity distributions, the methodology employed therein, as well as our adopted gauge ensemble are presented in section 3. The strategy we exercise to isolate the helicity distributions from our computed Ioffe-time pseudo-distributions is then developed in section 4. Particular emphasis is given to the reduction of systematic bias in our extractions by considering a model average of an array of model ans\u00e4tze. Discussion of our model-averaged results, as well as any phenomenological insight that may be garnered is reserved for section 5. Concluding remarks are shared in section 6, together with envisioned prospects for the distillation and pseudo-distribution amalgam."

Lorentz invariance demands eq. (2.1) have the following decomposition into invariant amplitudes [58]:\nM\u00b55 (p, z) = \u22122mNS\u00b5M ( \u03bd, z2 ) \u2212 2imNp\u00b5 (z \u00b7 S)N ( \u03bd, z2 ) + 2m3Nz\u00b5 (z \u00b7 S)R ( \u03bd, z2 ) ,\n(2.2) where we will refer to the invariant \u03bd \u2261 \u2212p \u00b7 z as the Ioffe-time [183], which is related to the original variable of that name in DIS [184] up to an inverse power of the hadron mass. The nucleon mass is mN , and the polarization vector of the nucleon\nS\u00b5 \u2261 12mN u (p, \u03bb) \u03b3\u00b5\u03b35u (p, \u03bb) (2.3)\nis normalized to render the amplitudes in eq. (2.2) dimensionless.\n\u2013 4 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 6\nTo define the helicity distribution, one should take a light-like separation, say z\u00b5 = (0, z\u2212,0\u22a5). Note that M\u00b55(p, z) is singular on the light cone z2 = 0, so one needs to apply some regularization procedure, which we denote below by Reg\u00b52 , with \u00b52 being the regularization parameter. Writing the nucleon four-momentum in the light-front coordinates p\u00b5 = ( p+, p\u2212,p\u22a5 ) , we have\nM+5 ( p, z\u2212 ) Reg\u00b52 = \u22122mNS+ [ M ( p+z\u2212, 0 ) + ip+z\u2212N ( p+z\u2212, 0 )] Reg\u00b52\n= \u22122mNS+ [M (\u03bd, 0)\u2212 i\u03bdN (\u03bd, 0)]Reg\u00b52 \u2261 \u22122mNS +I ( \u03bd, \u00b52 ) , (2.4)\nwhere I ( \u03bd, \u00b52 ) is the Ioffe-time distribution (ITD) whose \u03bd-Fourier transform defines the nucleon quark helicity PDF:\ngq/N ( x, \u00b52 ) = \u222b \u221e \u2212\u221e d\u03bd 2\u03c0e \u2212ix\u03bdI ( \u03bd, \u00b52 ) . (2.5)\nAccording to eq. (2.4), the x-dependence of the helicity distribution is dictated by the Ioffe-time dependence of a linear combination of the amplitudes M and N , for which we make the abbreviation Y ( \u03bd, z2 ) \u2261 M ( \u03bd, z2 ) \u2212 i\u03bdN ( \u03bd, z2 ) . The (light-cone) ITD I ( \u03bd, \u00b52\n) used in eq. (2.4) may be written as I ( \u03bd, \u00b52 ) = Y (\u03bd, 0)Reg\u00b52 .\nLorentz invariance implies the \u03bd-dependence of Y ( \u03bd, z2 ) can be computed in any frame.\nThis is especially beneficial in first-principles lattice QCD wherein the light-like separations needed to directly realize the matrix element in eq. (2.4) are expressly precluded by the Euclidean metric. For non-zero quark masses, the axial current is not conserved, and the axial charge gA ( \u00b52 ) determining the overall normalization of the helicity PDF is not known a priori. Furthermore, it depends on the choice of renormalization scheme and on the chosen input scale \u00b52. We defer a calculation of gA ( \u00b52 ) to a future work when a high fidelity calculation of the renormalized axial charge is available on our chosen ensemble. In the present work, following the strategy used in our recent paper [154], we will calculate the shapes of the nucleon quark helicity PDFs:\ngq\u2212/N ( x, \u00b52 ) /gA ( \u00b52 ) = gA ( \u00b52 )\u22121 [ gq/N ( x, \u00b52 ) \u2212 gq\u0304/N ( x, \u00b52 )] (2.6)\ngq+/N ( x, \u00b52 ) /gA ( \u00b52 ) = gA ( \u00b52 )\u22121 [ gq/N ( x, \u00b52 ) + gq\u0304/N ( x, \u00b52 )] . (2.7)\nA suitable frame amenable to lattice QCD is p\u00b5 = (0\u22a5, pz, E (pz)) and z\u00b5 = (0\u22a5, z3, 0), with each expressed in the Euclidean Cartesian notation. We elect to compute the \u00b5 = 3 component of M\u00b55 (p, z), for which the bare operator does not mix with other operators under renormalization [71]. With this kinematic setup our bare space-like matrix elements decompose in Minkowski space into a linear combination of Ioffe-time pseudo-distributions (pseudo-ITDs) according to:\nM35 (p, z3) = \u22122mNS3 [pz z\u0302] { M ( \u03bd, z23 ) \u2212 ipzz3N ( \u03bd, z23 )} \u2212 2m3Nz23S3 [pz z\u0302]R ( \u03bd, z23 ) ,\n(2.8) where the functional dependence of the nucleon polarization vector on the external momentum has been indicated. One can notice that the amplitudesM and N appear here as\n\u2013 5 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 6\nM ( \u03bd, z23 ) \u2212 ipzz3N ( \u03bd, z23 ) =M ( \u03bd, z23 ) \u2212 i\u03bdN ( \u03bd, z23 ) , i.e., in the same combination Y ( \u03bd, z23 ) as in the light-cone projection (2.4). Thus, we can write\nM35 (p, z3) = \u22122mNS3 [pz z\u0302] { Y ( \u03bd, z23 ) +m2Nz23R ( \u03bd, z23 )} , (2.9)\nand observe that the M35 matrix element is proportional to the combination Y\u0303 ( \u03bd, z23 ) = Y ( \u03bd, z23 ) +m2Nz23R ( \u03bd, z23 ) , (2.10)\nwhich, in addition to Y ( \u03bd, z23 ) , contains a contaminating term m2Nz23R ( \u03bd, z23 ) .1 One may try to separate the Y and R terms by considering the \u00b5 = 4 component of M\u00b55 (p, z), which receives no contribution from the R term if z = z3. However, in this case\nM45 (p, z3) = \u22122mN { S4M ( \u03bd, z23 ) \u2212 iS3E(pz)z3N ( \u03bd, z23 )} . (2.11)\nOne can see that the amplitudesM and N appear here in a combination quite distinct from the defining combination of Y ( \u03bd, z23 ) . Furthermore, such a calculation of M45 (p, z3) would require an a priori determination of the finite mixing that exists between the \u03b34\u03b35 operator and other Dirac matrices due to the lattice regularization [71] \u2014 an added complication we seek to avoid. For purely space-like separations,M\u00b55 (p, z) acquires additional ultraviolet (UV) divergences [185\u2013188] that must be regularized and removed before taking the continuum limit. As these additional divergences are known to renormalize multiplicatively [76, 78, 188, 189], we elect to remove them by forming an appropriate renormalization group (RG) invariant ratio. Such a prescription not only ensures a finite continuum limit, but also avoids the introduction of additional sources of systematic error stemming from gauge-fixed calculations, such as the RI/MOM scheme used in refs. [71, 72]. The standard procedure [55] within the pseudo-PDF approach is to divide the original matrix element M(p, z) by its pz = 0 counterpart M(pz = 0, z). Since the UV renormalization factor Z(z/a) is the same for M(p, z) and M(pz = 0, z), the ratio M(p, z)/M(pz = 0, z) does not contain link-related UV divergences and is an RG invariant, referred to as the reduced Ioffe-time pseudo-distribution [55, 74], or reduced pseudo-ITD. To enforce the normalization of unity at z3 = 0, a double ratio is employed \u2014 the RG invariant M(p, z3)/M(pz = 0, z3) is divided by its z3 = 0 magnitude. In analogy with the ratio utilized for the unpolarized [153] and transversity [154] quark PDFs of the nucleon, we may consider\nY ( \u03bd, z23 ) = ( Y\u0303 ( \u03bd, z23 ) Y\u0303 ( 0, z23 ) |pz=0 )/( Y\u0303 (\u03bd, 0) |z3=0 Y\u0303 (0, 0) |pz=0,z3=0 ) . (2.12)\nBy construction, Y ( \u03bd, z23 ) does not contain link-related UV divergences and is RG invari-\nant. However, as we discussed, Y\u0303 ( \u03bd, z2 ) differs from Y ( \u03bd, z2 ) (which is our goal) by a\ncontamination term m2Nz23R ( \u03bd, z23 ) , which was observed to be quite small in ref. [58]. We will attempt to parameterize, and subsequently remove, this additional z2 contamination, which we note is no worse than the corrections to our factorization relationship, through a parametric description of the reduced pseudo-ITD detailed in section 4.\n1The nucleon mass mN appears here as consequence of the definition (2.2); one can replace it by any scale \u039b, and appropriately re-scale the magnitude of R.\n\u2013 6 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 6"

Hence, it contributes exclusively to the R amplitude. If z were purely in the third component, the term z\u00b5/z2 would vanish for \u00b5 = 4, and be non-zero for \u00b5 = 3. This observation explains the well-known difference (see, e.g., ref. [87]) between the matching conditions for (pseudo)vector bilocal operators with temporal or spatial indices. In particular, if z = z3 and \u00b5 = 3, we have z\u00b5/z/z2 = \u03b33, and one can simply add the contribution of the fourth line of eq.

This ensemble, denoted herein as a094m358, is characterized by a 0.094 fm lattice spacing and m\u03c0 = 358MeV pion mass within a 323 \u00d7 64 lattice volume. We exploit the same 349 configuration subset of the a094m358 ensemble utilized in our earlier unpolarized [153] and transversity [154] quark PDF calculations. Table 1 summarizes aspects of the a094m358 ensemble relevant to this work, while the interested reader is referred to refs. [191, 192] for further details. To isolate the bare matrix elements, eq.

We consider interpolator separations of T \u2208 {4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14}a ' {0.38, 0.56, 0.75, 0.94, 1.13, 1.32} fm to aid in suppressing excited-state contamination. To map the Ioffe-time dependence of the pseudo-ITD, we utilize Wilson line lengths of 0 \u2264 z/a \u2264 8 and project our interpolators onto definite momenta ~p = \u00b1pz z\u0302 with pz = nz 2\u03c0aL \u2208 {0, 0.42, 0.83, 1.25, 1.67, 2.08, 2.50}GeV for nz \u2208 Z. The distillation [193] spatial smearing kernel is employed to increase the interpolator overlaps onto the confinement scale physics we are interested in. A realization [194] of the momentum smearing algorithm [195] is implemented to increase our operator-state overlaps for allowed momenta |nz| \u2265 4. This amounts in practice to application of a spatially varying phase {\nei ~\u03b6\u00b7~x \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 ~\u03b6 = \u00b12 \u00b7 2\u03c0L z\u0302 }\n(3.3)\nonto each eigenvector of the discretized gauge covariant Laplacian that comprise the distillation space. This prescription was found to be sufficient to shift the momentum\n\u2013 9 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 6\nspace overlaps within the distillation space to the larger values of momenta we consider. Details concerning our implementation of distillation within the pseudo-distribution formalism can be found in ref. [153]. Of that discussion, some salient features, especially concerning the infinite tower of finite-volume energy eigenstates {n\u2032, n} in (3.1) and (3.2), are worth highlighting here. The lattice discretization regularizes QCD, but it also breaks the continuum rotational symmetry. As a consequence baryons at rest, typically described by spin, are instead classified according to the finite number of irreducible representations (irreps) of the doublecover octahedral group ODh . In other words, the mass eigenstates of a baryon in the continuum, formerly classified by its JP quantum numbers, is instead characterized by its pattern of subduction across the irreps \u039b of ODh . The mixing of mass eigenstates induced by the reduced rotational symmetry is compounded further when considering non-zero momenta, for which ODh is broken further into its little groups, or subgroups, dependent on the star of ~p \u2014 denoted \u2217 (~p) [196]. To address the complication of isolating the groundstate J+ = 12\n+ nucleon at rest and in motion in our lattice calculation, we construct nucleon interpolators such that they possess definite transformation properties with respect to ODh and its little groups. Following refs. [197, 198], our interpolators realized using distillation are first constructed at rest in the continuum such that they possess definite flavor and JP quantum numbers. As consequence, such interpolators will only overlap onto continuum energy eigenstates of the same JP at rest:\n\u3008~p = ~0; J \u2032, P \u2032,M \u2032| [ OJ,P,M ( ~p = ~0 )]\u2020 |0\u3009 = Z [J ]\u03b4J,J \u2032\u03b4P,P \u2032\u03b4M,M \u2032 , (3.4)\nwhere Z [J ] is the numeric overlap factor associated with the continuum interpolator OJ,P,M (~p = ~0). Projecting our interpolators to non-zero momenta then represents a breaking of parity, and energy eigenstates are instead classified according to their value of helicity \u03bb. Tailoring the algorithm developed in ref. [199] to the case of baryons, continuum helicity operators are obtained by enacting a basis change on the continuum interpolators boosted to non-zero momenta along a chosen quantization direction, say z\u0302:[\nOJ P ,\u03bb (~p) ]\u2020 = \u2211 m D(J)m\u03bb (R) [ OJP ,m (|~p| z\u0302) ]\u2020 , (3.5)\nwhere D(J)m\u03bb (R) is a Wigner-D matrix, dependent on the active rotation R, that rotates the vector |~p| z\u0302 to ~p, thus obtaining a continuum helicity (creation) operator OJP ,\u03bb (~p) from boosted canonically quantized continuum interpolators. In other words, constructing our interpolators to have definite helicity in the continuum forces all operator-state overlaps to be in terms of ~p and \u03bb. The manifest breaking of continuum rotational symmetry by the cubic lattice, and further reduction for ~p 6= ~0, ensures continuum helicity eigenstates of each value of helicity will subduce into at least one irrep of the double-cover octahedral group ODh or its associated little groups. That is, our interpolators constructed with distillation will overlap with finite-volume energy eigenstates {n\u2032, n} characterized by numerous values of helicity.\n\u2013 10 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 6\nAlthough the distillation paradigm facilitates an especially cheap realization of variational improvement (e.g. refs. [200, 201]) within a given symmetry channel, recently applied, for instance, to expose the unpolarized [202] and helicity gluon [203] PDFs of the nucleon, we select a single, spatially-local interpolating field, denoted N2Ss 12\n+, to couple to the ground-state nucleon. This choice is motivated by computational expediency and a desire to maximize consistency with our earlier unpolarized and transversity quark PDF calculations [153, 154]."

            "text": "At asymptotically large temporal separations between operators, namely 0 \u03c4 T , the ratio between the three-point, eq. (3.2), and two-point, eq. (3.1), correlation functions will plateau to the desired bare matrix element. Of course such asymptotically large Euclidean times cannot be reached with any useful statistical precision, due to the exponential decay of the signal-to-noise ratio, and one must instead contend with excited-state contamination at short Euclidean times, where data are more precise. Although a multi-state fit to the three-point correlators with explicit dependence on both the insertion time slice and sourcesink separation can be used to isolate the bare matrix element, excited-state contamination will afflict the matrix element determination on the order of O ( e\u2212\u2206ET/2 ) , where \u2206E is the energy gap between the ground state and the lowest lying effective excited state. In an effort to further suppress the contamination from excited states, we elect to extract the bare matrix elements via the summation method [204, 205] whereby the ratio of the threepoint and two-point correlation functions is summed over the time slice \u03c4 of the inserted bare Wilson line operator O\u030a[\u03b33\u03b35] (z3):\nR (pz z\u0302, z3;T ) \u2261 T\u22121\u2211 \u03c4/a=1 C3pt (pz z\u0302, T ; z3, \u03c4) C2pt (pz z\u0302, T ) . (3.6)\nContact terms are expressly excluded from the R (pz z\u0302, z3;T ) signal by performing the operator summation for \u03c4/a \u2208 [1, T \u2212 1]. As the resulting geometric series depends linearly on the desired bare matrix element M (pz z\u0302, z3), an appropriate fit function to extract the bare matrix element is\nRfit (pz z\u0302, z3;T ) = A+M (pz z\u0302, z3)T +O ( e\u2212\u2206ET ) , (3.7)\nwhere, for brevity, we define M (p, z) \u2261 M35 (p, z). An important consequence of using the summation method is an exponential suppression of excited-state contamination to the extracted bare matrix element signal relative to multi-state methods for the same sourcesink separation T and level of statistics \u2014 corrections from excited-state contamination scale as O ( e\u2212\u2206ET ) = BTe\u2212\u2206ET when the summation method is employed. A representative subset of summed ratio data R (pz z\u0302, z3;T ) and applied linear fits (3.7) for source-sink separations T/a \u2208 {4 \u2212 14, 6 \u2212 14, 8 \u2212 14} are presented in figure 1 and figure 2. For the real component of the rest-frame matrix elements presented in figure 1, the high quality data for R (pz z\u0302, z3;T ) for all Wilson line lengths we consider is seen to lead to a stable determination of the bare matrix elements as the minimum fitted value\n\u2013 11 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 6\nof T/a is varied. As the nucleon momentum is increased, the expected degradation of the correlation function signals is encountered. Together with the exponential decay of the bare matrix element signal as z3 is increased, one observes poorer quality R (pz z\u0302, z3;T ) data and deviations from linearity for large values of T . For example, in figure 2 we illustrate both the real and imaginary components of R (pz z\u0302, z3;T ) data and applied linear fits for nucleon momenta apz = 3 \u00d7 2\u03c0L and z3 \u2208 {3a, 8a}, as well as for apz = 6 \u00d7 2\u03c0 L and z3 = 5a. In each case, the summed ratio data R (pz z\u0302, z3;T ) are seen to be clearly linear for T/a \u2264 8, with deviations for larger values. As a result, linear fits Rfit (pz z\u0302, z3;T ) begin to exhibit spread in the fitted bare matrix elements as the minimum fitted value of T/a is increased. This spread is, in part, understood by considering the derived effective energies in figure 3 of the ground-state nucleon. The reader is reminded the largest momenta without the use of a phased distillation space are |apz| = 3\u00d7 2\u03c0L , shown in red in figure 3. For T/a & 10 appreciable variations are observed in the effective energies which, in forming R (pz z\u0302, z3;T ), produces the expected spread in the fitted matrix element. Even with the use of phasing (purple, brown, and black in figure 3), any statistically meaningful data are lost for T/a & 10. In the hopes of obtaining a good balance between excited-state control and statistical precision, for the remainder of this manuscript we will thus consider the matrix elements obtained from the T/a \u2208 [6, 14] fits."

This systematic arises from uncertainty in the fitted matrix element as distinct time series are considered.

One of these invariant amplitudes, R ( \u03bd, z2 ) , is absent on the light-cone, but enters as a contamination to the space-like matrix elements we compute. With our choice of kinematics, namely hadron momentum p\u00b5 = (0\u22a5, pz, E (pz)) with Wilson line length z\u00b5 = (0\u22a5, z3, 0) and gamma matrix Lorentz index \u00b5 = 3, R ( \u03bd, z2\n) is unavoidable (cf. eq.

Our choice to construct interpolators that transform irreducibly under the double-cover octahedral group ODh and its discrete little groups leads to several determinations of M\u00b55 (p, z) for a given choice of {pz, z3} and \u00b5 = 3. The resulting system can be solved via a singular value decomposition (SVD) for the pseudo-ITD Y\u0303 ( \u03bd, z2 ) .

To provide a cogent foundation for this procedure, we step aside to consider in closer detail the group theoretic construction of our interpolators. The irrep-based correlation functions we compute of some external current J expose what are deemed subduced matrix elements following construction of appropriate ratios of three-point and two-point functions. To then access the canonical matrix element in eq. (2.1) we must establish their connection with the subduced matrix elements. The relationship between the subduced matrix elements and invariant amplitudes is given by\n\u3008~p,\u039b,\u00b5f |J \u039b\u0393,\u00b5\u0393 |~p,\u039b,\u00b5i\u3009= \u2211 l \u2211 \u03bbf ,\u03bb\u0393,\u03bbi S\u039b,J\u00b5f ,\u03bbf [ S\u039b\u0393,J\u0393\u00b5\u0393,\u03bb\u0393 ]\u2217[ S\u039b,J\u00b5i,\u03bbi ]\u2217 Kl(\u03bbf [J,~p];\u03bbi [J,~p])Al ( \u03bd,z2 ) ,\n(3.9) where a subduced matrix element \u3008~p,\u039b, \u00b5f | J \u039b\u0393,\u00b5\u0393 |~p,\u039b, \u00b5i\u3009 depends on a linear combination of invariant amplitudes Al, each of which is weighted by a helicity-dependent kinematic\n\u2013 14 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 6\nprefactor Kl (\u03bbf [J, ~p] ;\u03bbi [J, ~p]) whose irreducibility under the relevant cubic (sub)group is encoded via subduction coefficients2 S\u039b,J\u00b5,\u03bb . The kinematic prefactors are nothing but the Lorentz covariant structures associated with each invariant amplitude evaluated in a helicity basis, and, as we detail below, each can be straightforwardly isolated. In this notation, we follow the convention of ref. [199] by treating source interpolators and current insertions as creation operators, whereby the corresponding subduction coefficients are conjugated.\nRather than map the subduced matrix elements back into a canonical form like eq. 2.1, thereby abandoning the group symmetries we rely on, we instead re-express the canonical matrix elements appearing in the spectral decomposition of our three-point functions (3.2) in terms of the subduced matrix elements. From the discussion concerning operator-state overlaps at the outset of section 3, it follows the two complete sets of states, introduced between the nucleon interpolators and insertion in C [\u03b33\u03b35]3pt (pz z\u0302, T ; z3, \u03c4) to expose its spectral content, are projected by our interpolator-state overlaps onto the infinite tower of continuum helicity eigenstates that subduce into the irrep \u039b of the little group defined by \u2217 (~p = pz z\u0302). Despite the presence of excited-states and, in general, negative parity and J > 12 states that contribute to the irrep-based correlation functions in motion, in the limit of large Euclidean time C [\u03b33\u03b35]3pt (pz z\u0302, T ; z3, \u03c4) will be proportional to the subduced matrix element associated with the continuum JP = 12\n+ ground-state nucleon. Evidently the principal step needed to match the canonical matrix elements onto the subduced matrix elements is to evaluate the inner product of spinors representing the initial/final 12\n+ subduced states with each Lorentz structure associated with the invariant amplitudes Al in eq. (3.9). We now detail an algorithm for obtaining spinors representing the subduced initial/final states. The algorithm begins by considering a standard four-component Dirac spinor at rest and with spin quantized along the z\u0302-axis:\nu (0,m) = \u221a E(~p = ~0) +MN ( \u03c7 (m) 0 )T , (3.10)\nwhere \u03c7 (m) are the standard non-relativistic two-component spinors with z\u0302 component m, and MN the nucleon ground-state mass. To build the relativistic Dirac spinor in a helicity basis, we first perform a Lorentz boost Lz (|~p|) on u (0,m), such that it carries all the momentum of our desired state along its axis of quantization, followed by an active rotation D [R] of the relativistic spinor to the direction ~p:\nu (~p, \u03bb) = D [R]u (|~p| z\u0302,m) = D [R]Lz (|~p|)u (0,m) , (3.11)\nwith \u03bb the resulting values of helicity. Since the two component spinors \u03c7 (m) transform under rotations as [207]\nU [R (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3)]\u03c7 (m) = \u2211 m\u2032 D1/2m\u2032m (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3)\u03c7 ( m\u2032 ) , (3.12)\n2Subduction coefficients S\u039b,J\u00b5,\u03bb encode how the different values of helicity \u03bb of each object comprising our correlation functions subduce into distinct rows \u00b5 \u2208 {1, dim (\u039b)} of, in general, several irreps \u039b.\n\u2013 15 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 6\nwhere D1/2m\u2032m is a Wigner-D matrix and U [R] a unitary operator encoding the active rotation R, denoted by the Euler angles {\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3} in the zyz-convention, it follows\nu (~p, \u03bb) = D [R]u (|~p| z\u0302,m) = U [R (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3)] 0 0 U [R (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3)] u (|~p| z\u0302,m) . (3.13) An explicit realization of U [R] for spin-1/2 states:\nU [R (\u03b1, \u03b2, \u03b3)] = exp ( \u2212i\u03b12 \u03c3z ) exp ( \u2212i\u03b22\u03c3y ) exp ( \u2212i\u03b32\u03c3z ) , (3.14)\nthen completes the construction of the relativistic helicity spinor. To then impose the appropriate group symmetry, the same subduction coefficients employed in our irrep-based correlation functions are applied to the relativistic helicity spinor:\nu (~p,\u039b, \u00b5) = \u2211 \u03bb S\u039bJ\u00b5\u03bb u (~p, \u03bb) = \u2211 \u03bb S\u039bJ\u00b5\u03bbD [R]u (|~p| z\u0302,m) , (3.15)\nthereby producing a subduced spinor u (~p,\u039b, \u00b5) that transforms irreducibly within the irrep \u039b of the appropriate little group with row \u00b5 \u2208 {1, dim (\u039b)}. Since in this calculation we consider nucleon momenta ~p = pz z\u0302 collinear to the space-like Wilson line, the relevant irreps we must consider are G1g and E1. The former is the ODh irrep non-relativistic spin1/2 objects subduce into, while the latter is relevant for the subduction of \u03bb = 1/2 objects residing within the order-16 dicyclic (Dic4) cubic subgroup, or little group \u2014 this little group is defined by the set of rotations that leave momenta of the form ~p = (0, 0, n) |n\u2208Z\\{0}, and its permutations, invariant. Indeed the patterns of subduction for objects with non-zero helicity is quite nuanced. For example, \u03bb = 7/2 objects within Dic4 are also represented by the E1 irrep, while for momenta of the form ~p = (0, n, n) the irrep E1 will also contain information concerning \u03bb = 5/2 states [208]. The \u03bb 6= 1/2 states present within an irrep enter as additional contamination to the correlation functions we compute. Under the supposition of ground-state dominance, we need only consider the pattern of subduction for a J = 1/2 object at rest and a \u03bb = 1/2 object in motion. The subduction of interpolators at rest with continuum spin J = 0, 1 and J = 1/2, 3/2 are faithfully represented by the A1, T1 and G1, H irreps, respectively \u2014 the subduction coefficients for baryons at rest with continuum spin 3/2 \u2264 J \u2264 9/2 are given in ref. [197]. The subduction coefficients for baryons in-flight can be obtained following the prescription established in ref. [199]. Discussion concerning the inserted current\u2019s subduction coefficients S\u039b\u0393,J\u0393\u00b5\u0393,\u03bb\u0393 is omitted, as the inserted A3 = \u03c8\u03b33\u03b35\u03c8 current in the forward limit is faithfully represented by the three-dimensional T1 irrep of the cubic group. Were we to consider an insertion with J > 3/2 in the forward limit or an off-forward case more generally, the subduction of the inserted current would need to be carefully considered. The final step in connecting our irrep-based correlation functions with the canonical matrix element in eq. (2.1) is to evaluate the contraction of the final/initial state subduced spinors with each Lorentz structure. As G1g and E1 are both two-dimensional irreps, a total of four distinct subduced spinor contractions are realized for each combination of\n\u2013 16 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 6\n{pz, z3}. This produces what we deem a kinematic matrix, where each column corresponds to the four possible subduced spinor contractions associated with a given Lorentz structure, while each row will encode all contractions corresponding to a specific choice for the initial and final state subduced spinor rows. The kinematic matrix, when right-multiplied by the vector of invariant amplitudes (cf. eq. 2.9), can then be directly equated with the fitted subduced matrix elements. The result is the system of equations: \u3008pz z\u0302,\u039b,\u00b5f=1|O\u030a[\u03b33\u03b35](z3)|pz z\u0302,\u039b,\u00b5i=1\u3009 \u3008pz z\u0302,\u039b,\u00b5f=1|O\u030a[\u03b33\u03b35](z3)|pz z\u0302,\u039b,\u00b5i=2\u3009 \u3008pz z\u0302,\u039b,\u00b5f=2|O\u030a[\u03b33\u03b35](z3)|pz z\u0302,\u039b,\u00b5i=1\u3009 \u3008pz z\u0302,\u039b,\u00b5f=2|O\u030a[\u03b33\u03b35](z3)|pz z\u0302,\u039b,\u00b5i=2\u3009 =\u22122mN  S3[pz z\u0302]11 m2Nz23S3[pz z\u0302]11 S3[pz z\u0302]12 m2Nz23S3[pz z\u0302]12 S3[pz z\u0302]21 m2Nz23S3[pz z\u0302]21 S3[pz z\u0302]22 m2Nz23S3[pz z\u0302]22  Y(\u03bd,z2) R ( \u03bd,z2 ) , (3.16) where the entries on the left-hand side are the fitted subduced matrix elements obtained from the Rfit (pz z\u0302, z3;T ) fits (3.7), \u00b5f (\u00b5i) the row of the final (initial) state subduced spinor, and with the functional dependence of the nucleon polarization vector S3 on its momentum explicitly denoted. The subscripts of the polarization vector specify which row of the final/initial state subduced spinors are employed in the contraction. However, as noted, R ( \u03bd, z2 ) cannot be separated from Y ( \u03bd, z2 ) with our kinematic setup, so this system of equations instead reads: \u3008pz z\u0302,\u039b, \u00b5f = 1| O\u030a[\u03b33\u03b35] (z3) |pz z\u0302,\u039b, \u00b5i = 1\u3009 \u3008pz z\u0302,\u039b, \u00b5f = 1| O\u030a[\u03b33\u03b35] (z3) |pz z\u0302,\u039b, \u00b5i = 2\u3009 \u3008pz z\u0302,\u039b, \u00b5f = 2| O\u030a[\u03b33\u03b35] (z3) |pz z\u0302,\u039b, \u00b5i = 1\u3009 \u3008pz z\u0302,\u039b, \u00b5f = 2| O\u030a[\u03b33\u03b35] (z3) |pz z\u0302,\u039b, \u00b5i = 2\u3009  = \u22122mN  S3 [pz z\u0302]11 0 S3 [pz z\u0302]12 0 S3 [pz z\u0302]21 0 S3 [pz z\u0302]22 0  Y\u0303 (\u03bd, z2) R ( \u03bd, z2 )  , (3.17) where the contamination arising from R ( \u03bd, z2 ) for space-like intervals has been subsumed\ninto the pseudo-ITD Y\u0303 ( \u03bd, z2 ) , and the exclusive contribution of R ( \u03bd, z2 ) to this system has been removed by setting the elements of the rightmost column of the kinematic matrix to null. For each pair {pz, z3}, this system of equations is constructed and solved for the unknown amplitude Y\u0303 ( \u03bd, z2 ) using an SVD. Note the use of an SVD will isolate\nY\u0303 ( \u03bd, z2 ) such that it is consistent with the subduced matrix elements at the left-hand side of eq. 3.17. Since the non-trivial subduced matrix elements encode the continuum helicity matrix elements that define the helicity PDFs, the trivial use of SVD in this case, being nothing more than a sum of the non-trivial equations of this system, accomplishes the desired difference of continuum helicity matrix elements that theoretically define the PDF. Following the prescription established in section 2, we then populate the reduced pseudo-ITD Y ( \u03bd, z2 ) shown in figure 4."

Indeed matching the reduced pseudo-ITD to a common scale in MS alleviates some of these numerical challenges, as the resulting MS helicity Ioffe-time distribution I ( \u03bd, \u00b52 ) , in principle, involves no residual z2-dependence and directly determines the x-dependence of the underlying PDFs via an inverse Fourier transform. Such an evolution/matching step, however, does not quell the ill-posed inverse problem and is furthermore a potential source of additional systematic errors stemming from the interpolation or smooth description of the pseudo-distribution data needed for the evolution/matching procedure. Regardless of whether the matching step is applied explicitly to the reduced pseudo-ITD, it is common for a functional form to be assumed for the PDF and for its convolution with the matching kernel to be fit to the data [104, 111, 112, 116, 121, 202]. This paradigm is not unlike what one encounters in global analyses of experimental data, where a physically-motivated functional form is often assumed for the PDF [209\u2013212] and fit to discrete cross-section measurements over a limited range of xB. Several non-parametric reconstruction techniques have also been explored in the lattice QCD literature including the Backus-Gilbert method [213], Bayesian reconstruction [105], and an admixture giving rise to a Bayes-Gauss-Fourier transform [135].\nTo avoid sullying a high-fidelity determination of the helicity PDFs, we elect to parameterize the CP -even and CP -odd quark helicity PDFs via model ans\u00e4tze and fit their convolution with the one-loop matching kernel relating the {\u03bd, z2} dependencies of the reduced pseudo-ITD with the {x, \u00b52} dependencies of the PDF:\nRe Y ( \u03bd,z2 ) =gA ( \u00b52 )\u22121\u222b 1\n0 dx K\u2212\n( x\u03bd,z2\u00b52,\u03b1s ( \u00b52 )) gq\u2212/N ( x,\u00b52 ) +O ( z2\u039b2QCD ) Im Y ( \u03bd,z2 ) =gA ( \u00b52 )\u22121\u222b 1\n0 dx K+\n( x\u03bd,z2\u00b52,\u03b1s ( \u00b52 )) gq+/N ( x,\u00b52 ) +O ( z2\u039b2QCD ) . (4.1)\nHere the quark helicity PDFs gq\u2212/N ( x, \u00b52 ) and gq+/N ( x, \u00b52 ) are isolated from the Y ( \u03bd, z2 )\n\u2013 18 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 6\nsignal via cosine and sine transforms of the NLO kernel, defined in eq.

(4.3)\nThere is considerable flexibility in adopting a functional form to describe the unknown helicity PDFs. Absent a continuum of data over the infinite range \u03bd \u2208 [0,\u221e), any functional choice necessarily introduces model bias into the extraction procedure \u2014 we will return to this point in section 5.1. Following the paradigm established in refs. [153, 154, 206], we parameterize the unknown quark helicity PDFs using a basis of Jacobi polynomials3 {\u2126(\u03b1,\u03b2)n (x)}, the set of which form a complete orthogonal set on the interval x \u2208 [0, 1].

The helicity PDFs gq\u2212/N ( x, \u00b52 ) and gq+/N ( x, \u00b52 ) at some scale can therefore be unambiguously expressed as\ngq\u03c4/N (x) = x \u03b1 (1\u2212 x)\u03b2 \u221e\u2211 n=0 C(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u03c4,n \u2126(\u03b1,\u03b2)n (x) (4.5)\nfor arbitrarily chosen \u03b1, \u03b2 > \u22121, and \u03c4 \u2208 {\u2212,+} indicating either the CP -even or CP - odd quark helicity PDF. The relationship between the fitted parameters of the PDF and the reduced pseudo-ITD is obtained by considering the expansion of the matching kernels K\u2212 ( x\u03bd, z2\u00b52, \u03b1s ( \u00b52 )) and K+ ( x\u03bd, z2\u00b52, \u03b1s ( \u00b52 ))\nin terms of Jacobi polynomials.

Their contributions in Ioffe-time are given analogously by\nRe Yaz (\u03bd) = \u221e\u2211 n=1 \u03c3 (\u03b1,\u03b2) 0,n (\u03bd)C az (\u03b1,\u03b2) \u2212,n Im Yaz (\u03bd) = \u221e\u2211 n=0 \u03b7 (\u03b1,\u03b2) 0,n (\u03bd)C az (\u03b1,\u03b2) +,n (4.13)\nRe Yht (\u03bd) = \u221e\u2211 n=1 \u03c3 (\u03b1,\u03b2) 0,n (\u03bd)C ht (\u03b1,\u03b2) \u2212,n Im Yht (\u03bd) = \u221e\u2211 n=0 \u03b7 (\u03b1,\u03b2) 0,n (\u03bd)C ht (\u03b1,\u03b2) +,n , (4.14)\nwhere \u03c3(\u03b1,\u03b2)0,n and \u03b7 (\u03b1,\u03b2) 0,n are the tree-level components of eq. (4.8) and eq. (4.9), and C az (\u03b1,\u03b2) \u03c4,n and Cht (\u03b1,\u03b2)\u03c4,n are nuisance parameters associated with O (a/ |z3|) discretization\nand O ( z2k\u039b2kQCD ) higher-twist effects. Since Re Y is identically unity for zero Ioffe-time and \u03c3(\u03b1,\u03b2)0,0 (\u03bd = 0) 6= 0 (see refs. [206] and [153]), description of nuisance effects in Re Y by Jacobi polynomials must begin at order n = 1. Indeed the parameterization of the systematic corrections in this manner neglects additional sources of systematic error, notably those of O ( ln(z2) ) which could arise if \u03c3(\u03b1,\u03b2)n ( \u03bd, z2 ) and \u03b7(\u03b1,\u03b2)n ( \u03bd, z2 ) were considered in eq. (4.13) and eq. (4.14). We neglect such effects herein, as each nuisance term we consider is preceded by an ideally small prefactor (e.g. a/ |z3|, etc.) and the additional sources of systematic error arising at NLO would receive an additional suppression of O (\u03b1s). In practice, the infinite series of Jacobi polynomials for the leading-twist and nuisance effects must be truncated, precluding a model-independent determination of the PDF at the expense of potential bias. This truncation is in fact necessary to avoid over-fitting the reduced pseudo-ITD given the finite range of Ioffe-time \u03bd \u2208 [0, 9.42] within which Y ( \u03bd, z2\n) is populated. It is known [206] each Jacobi polynomial, via \u03c3(\u03b1,\u03b2)n and \u03b7(\u03b1,\u03b2)n , contributes appreciably to the pseudo-distribution in a small window of Ioffe-time, and this window shifts to larger values of Ioffe-time as the polynomial order is increased. In this sense, only low order (n . 5) Jacobi polynomials are needed to capture the information content of our data, as higher order (n & 5) Jacobi polynomials peak outside the Ioffe-time region\n\u2013 20 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 6\nfor which we have data. The complete functional form we use to describe the reduced pseudo-ITD and hence extract the leading-twist helicity PDFs is:\nRe Yfit ( \u03bd, z23 ) = Nlt\u2211 n=0 \u03c3(\u03b1,\u03b2)n ( \u03bd, z23\u00b5 2 ) C lt (\u03b1,\u03b2) \u2212,n + a |z3| Naz\u2211 n=1 \u03c3 (\u03b1,\u03b2) 0,n (\u03bd)C az (\u03b1,\u03b2) \u2212,n (4.15)\n+ z23\u039b2QCD Nt4\u2211 n=1 \u03c3 (\u03b1,\u03b2) 0,n (\u03bd)C t4 (\u03b1,\u03b2) \u2212,n + z43\u039b4QCD Nt6\u2211 n=1 \u03c3 (\u03b1,\u03b2) 0,n (\u03bd)C t6 (\u03b1,\u03b2) \u2212,n\nIm Yfit ( \u03bd, z23 ) = Nlt\u2211 n=0 \u03b7(\u03b1,\u03b2)n ( \u03bd, z23\u00b5 2 ) C lt (\u03b1,\u03b2) +,n + a |z3| Naz\u2211 k=0 \u03b7 (\u03b1,\u03b2) 0,n (\u03bd)C az (\u03b1,\u03b2) +,n (4.16)\n+ z23\u039b2QCD Nt4\u2211 n=0 \u03b7 (\u03b1,\u03b2) 0,n (\u03bd)C t4 (\u03b1,\u03b2) +,n + z43\u039b4QCD Nt6\u2211 n=0 \u03b7 (\u03b1,\u03b2) 0,n (\u03bd)C t6 (\u03b1,\u03b2) +,n ,\nwhere the role of higher-twist effects up to and including O ( z43\u039b4QCD ) are considered, and Nlt, Naz, Nt4, Nt6 denote the truncation orders for the leading-twist and nuisance terms. We take the input scale to be \u00b5 = 2GeV, with the three flavor MS strong coupling \u03b1s (\u00b5 = 2 GeV) = 0.303 and \u039bQCD = 286MeV adopted from LHAPDF6 [214]. We would like to determine the most likely set of parameters {\u03b8} given our data Y ( \u03bd, z2 ) and any prior knowledge I. This is codified by Bayes\u2019 Theorem:\nP [\u03b8 | Y, I] = P [Y | \u03b8]P [\u03b8 | I] P [Y | I] , (4.17)\nwhich states the posterior distribution P [\u03b8 | Y, I], or probability distribution of a set of parameters {\u03b8} to be correct given the data Y and prior information I, depends on the product distribution of P [Y | \u03b8], the probability distribution of the data Y given the parameters {\u03b8}, and P [\u03b8 | I], the probability distribution of {\u03b8} given the prior information, normalized by the marginal likelihood P [Y | I]. Although the marginal likelihood, which denotes the probability that the data are correct given the prior information I, normalizes the posterior distribution, its impact will be neglected herein as it does not depend on the model parameters {\u03b8}. The most likely set of parameters is found by maximizing the posterior distribution, or, equivalently, minimizing its negative logarithm:\nL2 \u2261 \u22122 log (P [\u03b8 | Y, I]) . (4.18)\nThe central limit theorem demands the probability distribution P [Y | \u03b8] be given by\nP [Y | \u03b8] \u221d Exp { \u2212\u03c7 2\n2\n} = Exp \u221212 \u2211 i,j (Yi \u2212Yi [\u03b8]) C\u22121ij (Yj \u2212Yj [\u03b8])  , (4.19) where i, j denote a fitted matrix element with momentum pz and Wilson line length z3, Yk [\u03b8] a prediction of the data given {\u03b8}, and C the data covariance estimated via a jackknife re-sampling of the data. We turn now to the prior distributions for each model parameter. Recall our choice in this manuscript to parameterize the PDFs via a basis of Jacobi polynomials on the\n\u2013 21 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 6\ninterval x \u2208 [0, 1] requires \u03b1, \u03b2 > \u22121. This prior information on the non-linear parameters p \u2208 {\u03b1, \u03b2} can be suitably encoded via shifted log-normal distributions:\nP [p | I] = 1 (p\u2212 p0)\u03c3p \u221a 2\u03c0\nExp { \u2212 [log (p\u2212 p0)\u2212 \u00b5p] 2\n2\u03c32p\n} , (4.20)\nwhere \u03b10, \u03b20 = \u22121 enforce the requirement for the Jacobi polynomials to form a complete orthogonal set, and the mean and variance of log (p\u2212 p0) are set respectively by \u00b5p and \u03c3p. Each of \u00b5p and \u03c3p can be tuned so as to produce a desired mean and variance of the underlying variate p.5 To guarantee a convergent PDF we make the requirement \u03b2 > 0, or equivalently \u03b20 = 0. Physical intuition can help set reasonable prior distributions for each of the linear expansion coefficients C\u2217,(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u03c4,n parameterizing the leading-twist and nuisance contributions to the reduced pseudo-ITD signal (eq. 4.15 and eq. 4.16). The only sensible restriction for each C\u2217,(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u03c4,n is to require the associated x-dependent distributions to be sub-leading relative to the leading-twist helicity PDF; otherwise, each expansion coefficient may assume an arbitrary value. To reflect this knowledge and allow the reduced pseudo-ITD to best dictate the size of each expansion coefficient, we impose normally distributed priors of the form:\nP [ C\u2217,(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u03c4,n | I ] = 1\u221a\n2\u03c0\u03c3ci Exp\n{ \u2212(ci \u2212 \u00b5i) 2\n2\u03c32ci\n} , (4.21)\nwhere the prior and width of each coefficient C\u2217,(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u03c4,n are denoted by \u00b5i and \u03c3i. Given the lack of any a priori knowledge on the size of each C\u2217,(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u03c4,n , we fix \u00b5i = 0 for each C \u2217,(\u03b1,\u03b2) \u03c4,n \u2014 larger prior widths are given to the expansion coefficients parameterizing the leading-twist component so as to embody the sub-leading effect of the nuisance terms. All fits to the reduced pseudo-ITD Y ( \u03bd, z2 ) are performed with the aid of the Variable Projection (VarPro) algorithm [215]. In this manner, the potentially large space of fit parameters (e.g. \u03b1, \u03b2 and any expansion coefficients C\u2217,(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u03c4,n ) is reduced to a non-linear optimization within the two-dimensional space defined by the parameters \u03b1 and \u03b2, which appear non-linearly in our PDF parameterizations of eq. (4.15) and eq. (4.16). Each expansion coefficient C\u2217,(\u03b1,\u03b2)\u03c4,n appears linearly and is solved for explicitly in terms of the non-linear basis functions {\u03c3(\u03b1,\u03b2)n , \u03c3(\u03b1,\u03b2)0,n , \u03b7 (\u03b1,\u03b2) n , \u03b7 (\u03b1,\u03b2) 0,n }."

In figure 5 the functional form eq. 4.15 is fit to Re Y ( \u03bd, z2 ) , subject to the aforementioned cuts, where the basis of Jacobi polynomials describing the leading-twist and nuisance terms have been truncated at orders (Nlt, Naz, Nt4, Nt6) = (3, 2, 2, 1). It is clear all data for a given z/a \u2208 [2, 8] are well described by the chosen functional form, though for platt = 3 (middle point of each panel in\n5To produce a random variate X with mean \u00b5X and variance \u03c32X , the log-normal parameters should be tuned to \u00b5p = ln (\n(\u00b5X\u2212X0)2\u221a (\u00b5X\u2212X0)2+\u03c32X\n) and \u03c32p = ln ( 1 + \u03c3 2 X\n(\u00b5X\u2212X0)2\n) .\n\u2013 22 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 6\nfigure 5) a slight tension of at most 1-\u03c3 is observed for modest values of z/a. Most notable is the presence of the highly precise platt = 1 and 2 data for each z/a \u2208 [2, 8]. Both are reflections of reasonably precise and extended plateaus in the two-point effective energies (cf. figure 3) at T/a = 6. At fixed cost, the signal-to-noise ratio of lattice correlators decays exponentially with the hadronic energy making these points critical for an efficient high precision analysis. These two data points for each z/a are precise enough to heavily constrain the fits for all jackknife bins, thereby explaining why the resultant fit exhibits rather small statistical fluctuations. Nonetheless, despite removing the entirety of the z/a = 1 data, it is encouraging to observe the functional dependence on \u03bd is reproduced reasonably well for the z/a = 1 data. The resulting parameters corresponding to the fit in figure 5 as well as the L2 and \u03c72 per degree of freedom are gathered in table 3. In examining the fit parameter correlations in figure 6, the leading-twist expansion coefficients C lt\u2212,n appear to strongly correlate with themselves, \u03b1 and \u03b2. Modest correlation is also observed between \u03b1, C lt\u2212,0, and the systematic error terms. The correlation of the systematic error terms with C lt\u2212,0 is not surprising, as C lt\u2212,0, though treated as a fitted parameter, fixes the valence quark sum rule and hence is sensitive to overall changes in the leading-twist PDF that arise from variations in the complete functional description of the reduced pseudo-ITD. Otherwise, the systematic errors terms do not exhibit strong correlation with \u03b2 or the remaining leading twist terms. This feature suggests that the systematic error terms are gathering distinct pieces of information that the leading twist terms are unable to capture, and are not generating a large bias. There appears to be a strong anti-correlation between the Caz\u2212,n parameters. This feature may imply a cancellation occurring between the two terms leading to the cumulative small effect seen in figure 7.\nUsing the fitted values of \u03b1, \u03b2 and each expansion coefficient C\u2217 (\u03b1,\u03b2)\u2212,n , we utilize eq. 4.5 to map the leading-twist valence quark helicity PDF gq\u2212/N (x) and the parameterized xspace systematic contaminations in the right panel of figure 6.

We address this quantitatively in section 5.1 in the context of a model averaging prescription.\nIndeed the x-space systematic contaminations illustrated in the right panel of figure 6 appear quite small.

(Upper left) Discretization and (Upper right) net higher-twist nuisance terms determined from the fit in figure 5 shown for z/a \u2208 [1, 8]. The lower two panels compare each nuisance effect (discretization at the left and higher-twist at the right) on an absolute scale with the parameterized leading-twist reduced pseudo-ITD Re Y ( \u03bd, z2 ) . Values of z/a excluded from the fit are presented in gray.\n\u2013 25 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 6\nThe discretization effect, denoted Re Yaz ( \u03bd, z2 ) , is seen to be, maximally, on the order of 1 \u2212 2% for the shortest values of z/a included in the fit \u2014 namely, z/a = 2, 3, with the strongest effect for \u03bd \u223c 5 \u2212 6. But given that the z/a = 2, 3 data extend up to Ioffe-times of \u03bd \u223c 2 \u2212 3.5 for the momenta at our disposal, the fit would suggest a shortdistance discretization effect at the sub-percent level (cf. lower left panel of figure 7). We do note that despite the apparent smallness of this effect, it is an important one to control and remove, as the effect, if left unaccounted for, would impart a statistically significant shift in the precise low-p data. The net higher-twist effect on the other hand, denoted Re Yt4,t6 ( \u03bd, z2 ) , shown in the upper right panel of figure 7 is observed to be small but non-zero across all Ioffe-times for all 2 \u2264 z/a < 8; it is only for \u03bd & 4 that a non-trivial higher-twist effect is detected by the fit for z/a & 2. By design the ratio in eq. (2.12) will cancel the leading higher twist contributions in the small \u03bd limit, so it is reassuring to find the parameterized power corrections in z2 to be numerically small over a broad range of Ioffe-time. However, unlike the discretization effect, the parameterized leadingtwist and power correction signals become comparable in precisely the interval for which the O ( z2n\u039b2nQCD ) nuisance effects are largest. As illustrated in the lower right panel of figure 7,\nfor \u03bd & 8 the leading-twist and O ( z2n\u039b2nQCD ) effects are indeed of similar magnitude. Since the maximal reach in Ioffe-time of this calculation is for \u03bdmax ' 9.42, we can be assured the Re Y ( \u03bd, z2 ) signal is dominated by the leading-twist contribution we aim to isolate, with the power corrections a relatively small effect that we parameterize and remove. That said, just as different experimental processes are subject to different power corrections when analyzed in a factorization framework, it is of crucial importance to quantify where the power corrections of the reduced pseudo-ITD become appreciable. Despite the na\u00efve ab-initio expectations from the size of the scale z2, empirically our data is consistent with the NLO evolution formula with small and effectively zero power corrections.\nIn the statistical errors of this single fit, a feature common to many previous PDF analyses can be seen. The statistical errors shrink around x \u223c 0.1. The low x region is where the inverse problem is unreliable according to mock data studies [105]. The individual jackknife samples will have an upward (downward) fluctuation for x above this point and a corresponding downward (upward) fluctuation after this point creating the apparent statistical precision around x \u223c 0.1. This feature, is created by correlations between the parameters to satisfy the very precise constraints of the data at low Ioffe time. In other words, the precise low \u03bd data puts a strong constraint on the value of the lowest moment of the PDF. For this model of the PDF to enforce that constraint while fixing the well-controlled large x region, the PDF must have corresponding upward and downward fluctuations above and below x \u223c 0.1. The location of this pinched point will be model dependent. In the subsequent model averaging procedure of section 5.1, these model dependent features will be seen to average away. This demonstrates the importance of studying many solutions to the inverse problem simultaneously.\nIn figure 8 a representative fit to Im Y ( \u03bd, z2 ) is illustrated, where the data have\nagain been cut on platt \u2208 [1, 6] and z/a \u2208 [2, 8], and the basis of Jacobi polynomials describing the leading-twist and nuisance terms have been truncated at orders\n\u2013 26 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 6\n0 1 2 0.00\n0.05\n0.10\n0.15\n0.20\n0.25 z/a = 1\n0 2 0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5 z/a = 2\n0 2 4 0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7 z/a = 3\n0 2 4 0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8 z/a = 4\n0.0 2.5 5.0 0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8 z/a = 5\n0 5 0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nz/a = 6\n0 5 0.0\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\nz/a = 7\n0 5 10 0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\n0.4\n0.5\n0.6\n0.7 z/a = 8\n0.2 0.4 0.6 .8 1.0 \u03bd\n0.2\n0.4\n0.6\n0.8\n1.0\nI m\nY (\u03bd ,z\n2 )\nFigure 8. Fit to the imaginary component of the reduced pseudo-ITD Y ( \u03bd, z2 ) obtained from summed ratio fits over the time series T/a \u2208 [6, 14] (dark error bars), and where the T/a \u2208 [4, 14] summed ratio fits provide a systematic error estimate (lightened error bars). The leading-twist, discretization, twist-4, and twist-6 corrections have been expanded in Jacobi polynomials up to orders (Nlt, Naz, Nt4, Nt6) = (3, 2, 2, 1). The data has been cut on platt \u2208 [1, 6] and z/a \u2208 [2, 8], with data excluded from the fit presented in gray.\n(Nlt, Naz, Nt4, Nt6) = (3, 2, 2, 1). As in the fit to Re Y ( \u03bd, z2 ) , the most precise platt = 1 data for each z/a \u2208 [2, 8] acts as the principal constraint for the candidate model, thereby limiting its statistical fluctuations estimated via jackknife. For this model, there is a tension with the platt = 3, 5 data points for most z/a, where the former is the highest momenta we consider without the use of phasing. Given that this is only a single model within a large space of models that regularize the inverse problem we face, it is not unreasonable to expect this tension to soften following a model averaging prescription. The parameters of this fit to Im Y ( \u03bd, z2 ) are given in table 3. Turning to the fit parameter covariance of this fit, shown in figure 9, similarly to the real component, there is a strong correlation amongst the leading twist parameters and a weaker correlation between the leading-twist and the systematic correction parameters \u2014 albeit the correlations between the leading-twist and systematic correction terms are smaller for Im Y ( \u03bd, z2 ) than for Re Y ( \u03bd, z2 ) .\nThe right panel of figure 9 shows the modeled leading-twist gq+/N (x) PDF and its systematic contaminating counterparts in x-space. Encouraging alignment is seen with the NNPDFpol1.1 [12] and JAM22 [26] global analyses for x & 0.5, with deviations apparent for smaller values of x, where model biases from the limited range of \u03bd are known to be largest.\n\u2013 27 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 6\n\u03b1 \u03b2 C lt0 C lt 1 C lt 2 C az 0 C az 1 C t4 0 C t4 1 C t6 0\n\u03b1\n\u03b2\nC lt0\nC lt1\nC lt2\nCaz0\nCaz1\nCt40\nCt41\nCt60\n1.00\n\u22120.74\n\u22120.78\n\u22120.54\n\u22120.83\n\u22120.12\n\u22120.05\n0.11\n0.48\n0.22\n\u22120.74\n1.00\n0.66\n0.02\n0.76\n\u22120.30\n\u22120.16\n\u22120.26\n\u22120.51\n\u22120.01\n\u22120.78\n0.66\n1.00\n0.70\n0.87\n\u22120.43\n\u22120.03\n\u22120.16\n\u22120.46\n\u22120.26\n\u22120.54\n0.02\n0.70\n1.00\n0.56\n\u22120.07\n0.09\n0.22\n\u22120.22\n\u22120.44\n\u22120.83\n0.76\n0.87\n0.56\n1.00\n\u22120.27\n\u22120.16\n0.08\n\u22120.54\n\u22120.28\n\u22120.12\n\u22120.30\n\u22120.43\n\u22120.07\n\u22120.27\n1.00\n0.42\n0.06\n\u22120.08\n\u22120.14\n\u22120.05\n\u22120.16\n\u22120.03\n0.09\n\u22120.16\n0.42\n1.00\n\u22120.45\n\u22120.20\n0.11\n0.11\n\u22120.26\n\u22120.16\n0.22\n0.08\n0.06\n\u22120.45\n1.00\n0.03\n\u22120.52\n0.48\n\u22120.51\n\u22120.46\n\u22120.22\n\u22120.54\n\u22120.08\n\u22120.20\n0.03\n1.00\n0.60\n0.22\n\u22120.01\n\u22120.26\n\u22120.44\n\u22120.28\n\u22120.14\n0.11\n\u22120.52\n0.60\n1.00\n\u22121.0\n\u22120.5\n0.0\n0.5\n1.0\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 x\n0\n1\n2\n3\n4\n5\n6\ng q + /N\n( x ,\u00b5\n2 )\nNNPDFpol1.1 JAM17 JAM22 gq+/N ( x, \u00b52 )[3221] /gA ( \u00b52 ) O(a/ |z|) O(z2\u039b2QCD) O(z4\u039b4QCD)\n0.6 0.8 1.0 \u22120.1\n0.0\n0.1\n0.2\n0.3\nFigure 9.

(Right) Derived leading-twist CP -odd helicity quark PDF (purple) and x-space contaminations compared with the recent global analyses NNPDFpol1.1 [12], JAM17 [23], and JAM22 [26].\nAs for the gq\u2212/N (x) determination above, this particular model does not incorporate the systematic fluctuations induced by the space of viable models capable of describing the Im Y ( \u03bd, z2 ) data and variable prior widths for each fit parameter. The latter is explored in appendix A, wherein the PDFs are found to be stable as greater flexibility of the prior distributions is allowed.\nThe suggestion by the fit in figure 8 of the presence of O (a/ |z|) effects in Im Y ( \u03bd, z2 ) is\nunderscored in the upper left of figure 10, where an appreciable effect is observed for all \u03bd \u2208 [0, 9.42] for which we have data. The effect is especially pronounced and statistically welldetermined for \u03bd \u223c 4, where, seen in the lower left of figure 10, it enters as a \u223c 10% contamination to the leading-twist signal. Moreover, that this discretization effect, Im Yaz ( \u03bd, z2 ) , is considerably better resolved than in the real component case is reason alone to understand why the imaginary component appears to be subject to greater systematic contamination. Regardless, our parameterization has proven essential to removing this well-determined, short-distance effect that, if neglected, would have necessarily skewed the gq+/N (x) determination. The parameterized higher-twist effects Im Yt4,t6 ( \u03bd, z2 ) , shown in the upper right of figure 10, are again numerically small and generally consistent with zero for z/a . 3, but do pollute Im Y ( \u03bd, z2 ) with an opposite sign compared to the parameterized Re Yt4,t6 ( \u03bd, z2\n) effect above. Relative to the leading-twist component, seen in the lower right of figure 10, the parameterized Im Yt4,t6 ( \u03bd, z2 ) effect has the potential to spoil the extraction of gq+/N (x) within the larger regions of Ioffe-time we isolate (e.g. \u03bd \u2208 [4, 9.42]). However it is within the small-\u03bd region that the precision of the Im Y ( \u03bd, z2 ) data works to our benefit \u2014 the precise small-platt, large-z data help to quantify and remove these z2 effects."

The lower two panels compare each nuisance effect (discretization at the left and higher-twist at the right) on an absolute scale with the parameterized leading-twist reduced pseudo-ITD Im Y ( \u03bd, z2 ) . Values of z/a excluded from the fit are presented in gray.\nnomials, the restriction to a truncated set, for both the leading-twist and nuisance terms, exposes a combinatorially large number of distinct functions capable of modeling the data. Selection of any particular model then manifestly carries bias that may skew any quantitative conclusions when considered in isolation. The need for a prescription to average several models together, and in so doing reduce the bias of any individual model, is apparent; this need is reinforced by recognizing that a particular cut on the reduced pseudo-ITD data also introduces bias, as distinct cuts may emphasize contrasting subsets of models.\nAmong the many prescriptions that can be utilized to create an average model description, one we explore is the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) [216]. For any given model function Fi, the AIC prescription assigns a factor ai = 2L2i + 2pi, where L2i is the negative logarithm of the posterior distribution of the model Fi with pi \u2208 Z+ parameters. The factor ai, or AIC (Fi), is then used to assign a weight, or probability, to Fi among the space of all models. In scenarios for which the number of data points ni fit by a model Fi becomes small or pi approaches ni, the AIC prescription is known to be biased in its estimate. To account for these scenarios, the corrected AIC [217], or AICc for short, is implemented where ai 7\u2192 Ai = ai + 2pi(pi+1)ni\u2212pi\u22121 .

(5.2)\nSince the AICc weights wi depend on the exponential of the AICc value Ai, it follows models with the smallest L2 values, that do not over-fit the data, are favored. Although we will consider applying the AICc prescription only to PDFs modeled with Jacobi polynomials, a more robust implementation would consider additional functional forms on the interval x \u2208 [0, 1], including those common from global analyses [209\u2013212] or even neural network parameterizations [218, 219]. This possibility is reserved for a future work. Within the platt = [1, 6] and z/a \u2208 [2, 8] data cuts, to construct an AICc model average estimate for both gq\u2212/N (x) and gq+/N (x) we consider the following variations in the orders of truncation for the Jacobi polynomials: Nlt \u2208 [1, 5], Naz \u2208 [0, 2], Nt4 \u2208 [0, 2], and Nt6 \u2208 [0, 1].

We observe that only a handful of models contribute appreciably to the AICc averages, while most have negligible impact. In fact, for both gAICq\u2212/N (x) and g AIC q+/N\n(x) the (Nlt, Naz, Nt4, Nt6) = (3, 2, 2, 1) model was found to dominate the AICc average \u2014 hence why this model was presented in figure 5 and figure 8. When comparing the AICc model average gAICq\u2212/N (x) in figure 11 with the selected gq\u2212/N (x) fit in figure 6, it is apparent much of the x & 0.5 information originates from the (Nlt, Naz, Nt4, Nt6) = (3, 2, 2, 1) model, while the considered models tend to differ in their descriptions of the small-x regime; the latter being evident in the increased uncertainty of gAICq\u2212/N (x) for that region of x. The resulting gAICq\u2212/N (x) is found to be in good agreement with the global analysis results we consider, notably the NNPDFpol1.1 [12] and JAM22 [26] datasets at small-x and large-x, respectively. In an effort to explore the stability of the nuisance effects we attempt to parameterize, the AICc prescription was also applied to the O (a/ |z|) and O ( z2n\u039b2nQCD\n) effects. Seen in figure 11, it is clear Re Y ( \u03bd, z2 ) is subject to very weak discretization and higher-twist nuisance effects that are generally stable with respect to model variations \u2014 albeit the higher-twist effects exhibit a greater variance around zero. As noted earlier in the present section, the increased variability of the leading-twist signal as a result of the AICc prescription causes the pinched errors of the (Nlt, Naz, Nt4, Nt6) = (3, 2, 2, 1) model PDF around x \u223c 0.1 (cf. figure 6) to vanish. This highlights the importance of considering as large a space of models as feasible when attempting to extract a PDF, for any one model choice may lead to erroneous conclusions concerning the size and manner of the leading-twist and systematic contamination signals.\nTurning attention to the gAICq+/N (x) result in figure 12, many structural similarities are observed when compared with the (Nlt, Naz, Nt4, Nt6) = (3, 2, 2, 1) model considered in\n\u2013 31 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 6\nisolation (cf. right panel of figure 9). Just as for the gAICq\u2212/N (x) PDF, the AICc procedure effectively removes the pinched errors of gq+/N (x) seen for x \u223c 0.2 in figure 9, and indicates greater variability between any particular model of gq+/N (x) for x . 0.5; the latter being a reflection of tension between our models and the platt = 3, 5 data. Furthermore, the model-averaged gAICq+/N (x) is inline with the global analyses we consider for x & 0.4, especially JAM22 [26]. Although any one model of gq+/N (x) suggests the presence of O ( z2n\u039b2nQCD ) nuisance effects, the AICc prescription indicates these effects are largely model-dependent. This model-dependence is seen by the consistency with zero of the AICc higher-twist nuisance effects, while the non-negligible presence in any one model manifests as broad variance around zero in the AICc average. Given the size of the discretization effects parameterized by the fit to Im Y ( \u03bd, z2 ) shown in the left panels of figure 10 and that model\u2019s dominant weight in the AICc procedure, it is not surprising to find strong support for a short-distance discretization effect after the AICc average. Indeed a more careful study of why the imaginary component of the reduced pseudo-ITD is subject to greater systematic contamination is warranted.\nWith the AICc model averaged estimates of gq\u2212/N ( x, \u00b52 ) /gA ( \u00b52 )\nand gq+/N (x) /gA ( \u00b52 )\nin hand, we determine the non-singlet quark and anti-quark helicity PDFs via gq/N ( x, \u00b52 ) /gA ( \u00b52 ) = [ gq\u2212/N (x) + gq+/N ( x, \u00b52 )] /2gA ( \u00b52 ) and\ngq\u0304/N ( x, \u00b52 ) /gA ( \u00b52 ) = [ gq+/N ( x, \u00b52 ) \u2212 gq\u2212/N ( x, \u00b52 )] /2gA ( \u00b52 ) , respectively. These distributions are illustrated with the corresponding NNPDFpol1.1, JAM17, and JAM22 determinations in figure 13. The non-singlet quark helicity PDF is seen to be structurally quite similar to the results from global analyses, albeit with less divergent behavior as x \u2192 0, which is driven by the same behavior in the gAICq+/N ( x, \u00b52 ) result. The non-singlet anti-quark helicity PDF on the other hand, is broadly quite small, favoring two changes in sign for 0.6 . x \u2264 1, while being somewhat negative for 0.1 . x . 0.45. Qualitatively it is straightforward to discern that the first Mellin moment of gAICq\u0304/N ( x, \u00b52 ) /gA ( \u00b52 ) will be small, indicating a marginal contribution of the intrinsic light-quark sea to the overall nucleon spin.\n\u2013 32 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 6"

            "text": "The quark helicity PDF, together with the unpolarized and transversity quark PDFs, is essential for a complete characterization at leading-twist of the collinear structure of a hadron involved in an inclusive reaction. Whereas the isovector quark helicity PDFs of the nucleon have been calculated in lattice QCD, we have presented the first such calculation that leverages the pseudo-distribution formalism to perturbatively match renormalization group invariant ratios onto the MS helicity PDF. In this work, we have presented our computation of gq\u2212/N ( x, \u00b52 ) /gA ( \u00b52 ) and gq+/N ( x, \u00b52 ) /gA ( \u00b52 ) at an input scale \u00b52 = 4 GeV2, and found encouraging agreement with an array of global analyses. Moreover, our quoted uncertainty provides for the tantalizing prospect of reducing the uncertainty of the quark helicity PDFs obtained from global analyses when analyzed in a framework akin to refs. [140, 155, 220]. A dedicated, future calculation of the scale-dependent axial charge gA ( \u00b52 ) will render the correct overall normalization of our isolated isovector quark helicity PDFs. We have highlighted the presence of an invariant amplitude that contributes to the space-like matrix elements we have computed, but whose dynamics on the light-cone is absent. This additional amplitude thus enters as an additional source of polynomial z2 corrections that has the potential to sully a reliable determination of the PDF, especially as larger Wilson line lengths are employed to map the Ioffe-time dependence of the leading pseudo-ITD. Through application of the distillation spatial smearing kernel and our construction of nucleon interpolators that transform irreducibly under the double-cover octahedral group ODh and its little groups, we proposed a prescription, based on a singular value decomposition (SVD), for disentangling the invariant amplitudes that contribute to matrix elements of the non-local quark bilinear operator we are interested in. Due to an unavoidable finite mixing that exists for the axial vector components that are not collinear to the Wilson line direction, we were unable to establish, in the case of quark helicity, a minimally constrained or over-constrained system of equations to separate the leading pseudo-ITD from the contaminating amplitude (referred to as R ( \u03bd, z2 ) in eq. 2.2). Regardless, by abandoning the use of correlator projectors and leaning into the group theoretic infrastructure codified by our interpolator construction paradigm via construction of subduced nucleon helicity spinors, we populated a kinematic matrix whose elements are contractions of each subduced spinor with the Lorentz structures associated with the leading and contaminating amplitudes. Since sufficient constraints could not be established (i.e. finite mixing) to separate the leading pseudo-ITD from the contaminating amplitude, we explicitly set to null the kinematic matrix elements that were associated with the contaminating amplitude. By construction, the effect of the contamination was then incorporated into a single amplitude deemed Y\u0303 ( \u03bd, z2 ) . Given a kinematic matrix and fitted\nsubduced matrix elements, a trivial application of an SVD solved for Y\u0303 ( \u03bd, z2 ) . Our choice\nto parameterize the derived reduced pseudo-ITD Y ( \u03bd, z2 ) in a basis of Jacobi polynomials then afforded the opportunity to account for the additional z2 contamination arising from R ( \u03bd, z2 ) embedded in Y\u0303 ( \u03bd, z2 ) , since this effect is no worse than the corrections to our factorization relationship. Though the prescription we established herein could not rigorously separate R ( \u03bd, z2 ) from the leading pseudo-ITD, the utility of this approach bears\n\u2013 33 \u2013\nJ H E P 0 3 ( 2 0 2 3 ) 0 8 6\nconsiderable weight for future PDF calculations within the flavor singlet and gluonic sectors, as well as in the off-forward regime relevant for the extraction of generalized parton distributions, when several invariant amplitudes are present. In line with contemporary HadStruc calculations of quark and gluon PDFs, we have leveraged a basis of Jacobi polynomials that span the interval x \u2208 [0, 1] to model the functional dependence of the helicity PDFs and any systematic contamination, such as higher-twist and discretization errors. As the expansion of the PDFs and x-dependent contaminations in Jacobi polynomials was truncated at a finite order, the potential exists for model bias to afflict any particular extraction treated in isolation. To minimize this bias and allow the information content of the data to drive model selection, we performed a large number of parametric fits of the reduced pseudo-ITD data where the order of truncation for the Jacobi polynomials describing the leading-twist, discretization, and higher-twist effects were varied simultaneously with cuts on the extremal momenta and displacements utilized in this calculation. The results of these fits were combined using the corrected Akaike Information Criterion, or AICc, yielding an appropriate estimate of the statistical and systematic uncertainty in the extracted quark helicity PDFs. While the AIC averaging procedure applied to so many models may have removed some of the biases, future analyses could combine not just Jacobi polynomial parameterizations but any other model for the PDF or its moments for an improved control of any residual model biases on the final results. The AICc procedure, curiously, found a manifest suppression of higher-twist effects in the computed reduced pseudo-ITD data, yet a strong indication of a short-distance discretization effect. This observation alone warrants continued study of the leading-twist PDFs on lattice ensembles characterized by finer lattice spacings. Finally, the non-singlet quark and anti-quark helicity PDFs were obtained from the AICc averaged gq\u2212/N (x) and gq+/N (x) PDFs. The non-singlet quark helicity PDF gq/N (x) was found to be generally consistent with extractions from global analyses, with a less divergent approach to x \u2192 0. The non-singlet anti-quark helicity PDF gq\u0304/N (x), on the other hand, was observed to be consistent, or very nearly so, with recent global analysis extractions for all values of the parton momentum fraction."

The first case doubles the Default prior widths, while the second case halves the Default prior widths, to which the cases are referred to as Wide and Thin, respectively. The adjusted widths are gathered in table 2. To avoid obfuscation of the extracted PDF\u2019s dependence on the priors, we again cut on the Y ( \u03bd, z2 ) data which includes the matrix element fitting systematic (3.8) according to platt \u2208 [1, 6] and z/a \u2208 [2, 8]. In figure 14 the dependence of the extracted gq\u2212/N (x) and gq+/N (x) PDFs on the re-scaled prior distributions is illustrated. In each case, the gq\u2212/N (x) and gq+/N (x) PDFs obtained using Wide and Thin priors are normalized by the central value of the corresponding PDF obtained using the Default priors \u2014 denoted respectively as grefq\u2212/N (x) and grefq+/N (x). Evidently reducing the widths of each prior distribution by a factor of two yields gq\u2212/N (x) and gq+/N (x) PDFs (red in figure 14) that are in tension with the Default PDF determinations across the x-space region 0 \u2264 x . 0.6. The deviations in the central values of the PDFs observed for x . 0.6 range between \u223c 5 \u2212 10% and \u223c 5 \u2212 30%, respectively, for gq\u2212/N (x) and gq+/N (x). These findings are unsurprising and highlight the importance of flexible prior distributions, as the amount of variability any model can assume in an L2 optimization process is inextricably linked to the model\u2019s prior distributions. It is especially encouraging to find that the q\u2212/N (x) and gq+/N (x) distributions are stable as the widths of the prior distributions are doubled, shown as blue in figure 14.
