    "abstractText": "Cytochrome P450 enzymes play important roles in the biosynthesis of macrolide antibiotics by mediating a vast variety of regioand stereoselective oxidativemodifications, thus improving their chemical diversity, biological activities, and pharmaceutical properties. Tremendous efforts have been made on engineering the reactivity and selectivity of these useful biocatalysts. However, the 20 proteinogenic amino acids cannot always satisfy the requirement of sitedirected/randommutagenesis and rational protein design of P450 enzymes. To address this issue, herein, we practice the semi-rational non-canonical amino acid mutagenesis for the pikromycin biosynthetic P450 enzyme PikC, which recognizes its native macrolide substrates with a 12or 14-membered ring macrolactone linked to a deoxyamino sugar through a unique sugar-anchoring mechanism. Based on a semi-rationally designed substrate binding strategy, non-canonical amino acid mutagenesis at the His238 position enables the unnatural activities of several PikC mutants towards the macrolactone precursors without any sugar appendix.With the aglycone hydroxylating activities, the pikromycin biosynthetic pathway is rewired by the representative mutant PikCH238pAcF carrying a p-acetylphenylalanine residue at theHis238 position and a promiscuous glycosyltransferase. Moreover, structural analysis of substratefree and three different enzyme-substrate complexes of PikCH238pAcF provides significant mechanistic insights into the substrate binding and catalytic selectivity of this paradigm biosynthetic P450 enzyme.",

Tremendous efforts have been made on engineering the reactivity and selectivity of these useful biocatalysts. However, the 20 proteinogenic amino acids cannot always satisfy the requirement of sitedirected/randommutagenesis and rational protein design of P450 enzymes. To address this issue, herein, we practice the semi-rational non-canonical amino acid mutagenesis for the pikromycin biosynthetic P450 enzyme PikC, which recognizes its native macrolide substrates with a 12- or 14-membered ring macrolactone linked to a deoxyamino sugar through a unique sugar-anchoring mechanism. Based on a semi-rationally designed substrate binding strategy, non-canonical amino acid mutagenesis at the His238 position enables the unnatural activities of several PikC mutants towards the macrolactone precursors without any sugar appendix.With the aglycone hydroxylating activities, the pikromycin biosynthetic pathway is rewired by the representative mutant PikCH238pAcF carrying a p-acetylphenylalanine residue at theHis238 position and a promiscuous glycosyltransferase. Moreover, structural analysis of substratefree and three different enzyme-substrate complexes of PikCH238pAcF provides significant mechanistic insights into the substrate binding and catalytic selectivity of this paradigm biosynthetic P450 enzyme.\nThe ability of microorganisms to rapid evolve resistance to antibiotics warrants endless requirements for discovering and engineering new antimicrobial agents1. Macrolide antibiotics with the hallmark feature of a variably sized (\u226512 carbons) macrolactone ring connected to a deoxy and/or amino-sugar moiety via glycosylic bond have demonstrated remarkable therapeutic applications as effective protein synthesis inhibitors2. To address the central issues of side effects and antibiotic resistance, three generations of macrolides have been\nReceived: 7 October 2022\nAccepted: 9 March 2023\nCheck for updates\n1State Key Laboratory of Microbial Technology, Shandong University, Qingdao, Shandong 266237, China. 2Laboratory for Marine Biology and Biotechnology, Qingdao National Laboratory for Marine Science and Technology, Qingdao, Shandong 266237, China. 3School of Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sun Yat-sen University,Guangzhou510006,China. 4Theseauthors contributedequally: YunjunPan,GuobangLi. e-mail: xgao@email.sdu.edu.cn; lishengying@sdu.edu.cn\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:1669 1\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\ndeveloped in the past century. Nowadays, macrolide antibiotics are still widely used in the treatment of infectious2,3, respiratory4, digestive5, and other diseases. In particular, the third generation of macrolides, namely ketolides (with the 3-glycosylated hydroxyl group replaced by a 3-keto group), have shown enhanced activities against many macrolide-resistant pathogens6.\nDuring the biosynthesis of diverse macrolide natural products, after assembly of the macrolactone core structure by modular type I polyketide synthases (PKSs), glycosylation and oxidation that are mediated by various glycosyltransferases (GTs; e.g., UGTs, UDPdependent GTs) and cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (P450s), respectively, are among the most important post-PKS tailoring modifications7,8. Interestingly, the order of these two types of structural decoration largely varies in different macrolide biosynthetic pathways (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 1). For example, the glycosylation step must occur prior to the P450-catalyzed oxidation in the biosynthesis of pikromycin7,9 (Fig. 1a) and rosamicin10 (Supplementary Fig. 1a). By contrast, the P450-mediated transformation precedes the glycosylation in many cases such as avermectins11 (Fig. 1b) and disciformycins12 (Supplementary Fig. 1b). More intriguingly, the monooxygenation and glycosylation steps even stagger in the mycinamicin13,14 (Fig. 1c) and erythromycin15 (Supplementary Fig. 1c) biosynthetic pathways. It is noteworthy that the biosynthetic order in most of these cases cannot be reversed, indicative of the stringent\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:1669 2\nsubstrate specificities of the involved P450s and GTs. The irreversible order likely endows the antibiotic producer organisms with evolutionary benefit by directing the metabolic flux to a single or a limited number of product(s) with high potency. However, from the standpoint of structural diversification for new drug development, the frozen biosynthetic order is a limiting factor because it would hamper more extensive pathway reprogramming and combinatorial biosynthesis16. To resolve this problem, the substrate specificity of GTs and P450s need to be changed simultaneously, which represents a substantial biocatalytic challenge.\nComparatively, we reason that the order of oxidationglycosylation might be advantageous over that of glycosylationoxidation with respect to product structural diversification because the preceding oxidation (as a small structural modification) is unlikely to impede the following glycosylation(s). Moreover, the oxidation in some cases could generate a new chemical handle for further glycosylation(s), e.g., mycinamicins (Fig. 1c) and disciformycins (Supplementary Fig. 1b). However, the sugar attachment by GTs would cause a significant increase of both the size and polarity of the resulting macrolide, thus limiting the potential oxidation by a P450 enzyme that originally favors the smaller hydrophobic macrolactone substrate.\nCytochrome P450 PikC (CYP107L1) from Streptomyces venezuelae ATCC 15439 is an intriguing P450 monooxygenase with unusual innate substrate flexibility17,18. In the biosynthetic pathway of methymycin/neomethymycin (1/2) and pikromycin (3, the first discovered natural ketolide), the sole P450 enzyme recognizes both 12-membered ring macrolide YC-17 (4) and 14-membered ring macrolide narbomycin (5) as substrates (Fig. 1a). Comparatively, PikC catalyzes the hydroxylation of 4 at the C10 allylic position and the C12 methylene position with almost equal efficiency, while the PikC-mediated hydroxylation of 5 preferentially occurs at the C12 allylic position19,20. In the past two decades, Sherman and co-workers have made tremendous efforts on the structures, mechanisms, and engineering of PikC21\u201324, making this enzyme a paradigmofmicrobial P450 enzyme.\nAlthough the substrate scope and product diversity of PikC have been dramatically expanded by enzyme engineering and substrate engineering21\u201324, to the best of our knowledge, there is no report of any PikC mutant that is able to directly oxidize the two native macrolactones including 10-deoxymethonolide (6) and narbonolide (7), likely due to the very poor binding of these two unglycosylated substrate precursors to PikC. This is mechanistically owing to the dependence of the dimethylamino sugar desosamine in both 4 and 5 during substrate recognition and productive binding by PikC. To date, it has been well known that the presence of the positively charged dialkylamino group as a substrate anchor is a prerequisite for PikC\u2019s substrate recognition and catalytic activities17,21.\nTo further diversify the structures related to the 1/2/3 biosynthetic pathway by reversing the natural glycosylation-oxidation order, in this study, we challenge the unnatural activity of PikC against the macrolactones without any appendix. Taking advantage of the noncanonical amino acids (ncAAs), we successfully reshape the sugar binding pocket of PikC in a manner that the proteinogenic amino acid mutagenesis cannot achieve. A number of mutants with the pivotal residue His238 replaced by different ncAAs show significant hydroxylation activities towards the aglycones 6 and 7. X-ray crystal structures and molecular docking analyses of the optimal mutant PikCH238pAcF in substrate-free and substrate-bound forms provide significant insights into the mechanisms of PikC\u2019s substrate recognition and regioselectivity. Furthermore, the oxidation activity towards6 and 7 enable us to change the order of late pikromycin biosynthetic pathway, giving rise to unnaturalmono- and di-glucosylatedmacrolide derivatives."

            "text": "Semi-rational engineering of PikC into an aglycone hydroxylase by ncAA mutagenesis According to the previous structural andmechanistic studies19,20,23, the sugar (desosamine) and aglycone (6 and 7) moieties of PikC\u2019s natural substrates (4 and 5) adopt distinct binding pockets (Fig. 2a). To enable the productive binding of either 6 or 7 to PikC, we reasoned that the introduction of a rather bulky amino acid to occupy the accommodating space of desosaminemight work. Moreover, this amino acid should endow the aglycones with some specific interactions, thereby increasing the substrate binding affinity to a productive level. Thus, we first identified the amino acids within 4.0 \u00c5 away from the desosamine of either substrate, including Glu85, Glu94, Phe178 and His238 (Fig. 2a). Next, the ncAA p-acetylphenylalanine (pAcF), which was previously reported to show beneficial effects on P450\u2019s efficiency and regioselectivity25, was selected to individually replace the four residues by amber stop codon suppression and the well-established system of mutant Methanococcus jannaschii tyrosyl aaRS/tRNA pair in Escherichia coli26. We expected that the unnatural bulky acetylphenyl side chain with \u03c0-stacking and hydrogen bonding potential would not only sterically occupy the desosamine binding pocket, but also provide some favorable interactions with the macrolactone ring of 6 or 7, thus enabling the unnatural aglycone hydroxylation activities.\nTo our delight, pAcF was successfully incorporated into PikC with high efficiency as evidenced by tandem mass spectrometry (Supplementary Fig. 2) and electrospray ionization-quadrupole-time of flightmass spectrometry (ESI-Q-TOF-MS) analysis of the purified mutant P450 enzyme PikCH238pAcF (Fig. 2b, c). The two macrolactone substrates 6 and 7 were prepared using the glycosyltransferase DesVII inactivated strain Sv-\u0394desVII (seeMethods).

A peak measured at 49187.8187Da corresponds to PikCH238pAcF lacking the initiating methionine residue (the calculated mass of PikCH238pAcF: 49187.7500Da).\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:1669 3\npAcF mutants including PikCE85pAcF, PikCE94pAcF, PikCF178pAcF and PikCH238pAcF (Supplementary Figs. 3\u20135), PikCH238pAcF turned out to be the only mutant to show a low but detectable activity towards both 6 and 7with the respective substrate conversion ratios of 17.9 \u00b1 2.4% and 24.7 \u00b1 3.0% (Supplementary Fig. 6). The low but significant activities of this ncAAmutantmight result fromthe challengingnature of C-Hbond activation and low binding affinity towards aglycones (see below). Upon high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses (Supplementary Figs. 9\u201322, 35\u201339), the structures of the two products from 6 were determined to be methynolide (8, the C10-hydroxylated product) and neomethynolide (9, the C12-hydroxylated product) (Fig. 3a) with a relative ratio of 19:1 (Fig. 3c). The single hydroxylation product of 7 was determined to be pikronolide (10, the C12-hydroxylated product) (Fig. 3a, d). Interestingly, tiny amounts of 8\u201310 were previously isolated from another S. venezuelae strain27 and a desI (the sugar dehydrase gene) knockout mutant28, perhaps due to the marginal activity of PikCWT or other unknown oxidase towards 6 and 7 in vivo. However, the hypothetical activities of PikCWT against 6 and 7 were not observed in vitro (Fig. 3c, d). Of note, all 20 natural amino acids at the His238 position were incapable of reproducing the aglycone hydroxylation activity caused by pAcF (Supplementary Fig. 7).\nUnexpected discovery of the improved activities to native substrates by aromatic substitution at His238 Strikingly, compared with the activities of PikCWT towards 4 (45.0 \u00b1 4.5% conversion) and 5 (54.4 \u00b1 2.8%), PikCH238pAcF exhibited 0.9- and 0.7-fold increase in the hydroxylation activity towards the natural substrates 4 and 5, respectively (Fig. 3e, f). Unlike the wild-type enzyme that almost equally hydroxylates C10 and C12 positions of 4, PikCH238pAcF regioselectively hydroxylated the C10 C-H bond, producing 1 as the major product (Fig. 3e, 1 : 2 = 9 : 1). Inspired by these unexpected results, we examined the activities of twenty proteinogenic variants of His238 towards 4 and 5. As a result, these mutants exhibited varied activities and product distributions against 4 with H238F and H238Y being the most active mutants. Specifically, the substrate conversion ratios of PikCH238F and PikCH238Y towards 4 were 93.2 \u00b1 5.3% and 83.8 \u00b1 3.9%, respectively. However, these two mutants did not significantly change the product ratio as PikCH238pAcF did (Fig. 3e, Supplementary Fig. 51). As for 5, PikCH238F and PikCH238Y were also the most efficient mutants with the substrate conversion ratios of 96.3 \u00b1 1.7% and 88.3 \u00b1 3.3%, respectively (Fig. 3f, Supplementary\nFig. 51). Taken together, we surmised that the presence of an aromatic side chain at the His238 position might be essential for the improvement of native activities of PikC. However, as mentioned above, PikCH238F and PikCH238Y were unable to oxidize 6 and 7 (Fig. 3c, d), suggesting that the aglycone hydroxylation activity of PikCH238pAcF should stem from a mechanism different from that for the enhanced activities towards 4 and 5.\nDetermination of substrate binding affinities To rationalize the enhanced activity of PikCH238pAcF towards 4\u20137, we compared the substrate binding affinities of PikCWT and PikCH238pAcF by measuring the spectral changes upon different substrate titrations19,20. Similar to the previous report, 6 and 7 could not bind or only marginally bound to PikCWT so that their KD values could not be determined due to poor binding and limited substrate solubility (Supplementary Table 1). By contrast, the KD values of 6 and 7 towards PikCH238pAcF were determined as 207.5 \u00b5M and 236.9 \u00b5M, respectively, comparable to those of 4 and 5 towards PikCWT (177.6 \u00b5M and 373.6 \u00b5M). Compared with PikCWT, the binding affinities of PikCH238F and PikCH238Y to 4 increased by 14.9 and 9.6 times, respectively. The affinity of PikCH238pAcF to 4 also increased by 3.4-fold (KD = 40.2 \u00b5M). Similarly, the binding affinities of PikCH238F and PikCH238Y to 5 increased by 4.1 and 4.9 times, respectively. The affinity of PikCH238pAcF\nto 5 also increased by 3.3-fold (KD = 87.1 \u00b5M). All these results are well consistent with the corresponding enzymatic activities (Fig. 3), at least partially explaining the improved activities of the His238 mutants.\nExtended ncAA mutagenesis analysis Motivated by the above results, we tested more aromatic ncAAs with diversepara-substituents for His238 replacement, including p-ethynylL-phenylalanine (pENF)29, 4-phenyl-L-phenylalanine (BipA)30, p-propargyloxyphenylalanine (pPrF)30, p-azido-L-phenylalanine (pAzF)30, O-methyltyrosine (OMeY)31, O-tert-butyltyrosine (OtBuY)31, and p-bromophenylalanine (pBrF)31 (Fig. 3b). All purified mutants (Supplementary Table 4) except PikCH238BipA exhibited varied hydroxylation activities towards 6, with PikCH238pAcF giving the highest hydroxylation activity. Unlike 6 that could be accepted by almost all ncAA mutants to different extents, the 14-membered ring macrolactone 7was only hydroxylated by PikCH238pAcF (Fig. 3b).We reasoned that these activity profilesmight result from the complicated interplay of substrate structures and the size, shape and electronic property of the ncAA side chain. Essentially, all the active ncAA mutants have an aromatic side chain larger than tyrosine (Supplementary Fig. 8).\nCrystallographic/mechanistic analyses of PikCH238pAcF To understand the molecular mechanism of the unique catalytic activity of PikCH238pAcF, we first determined the high-resolution threedimensional structure of substrate-free PikCH238pAcF (PDB ID code: 7XBM, 2.4 \u00c5 resolution, Supplementary Table 9). In each asymmetric unit, there are two molecules of PikCH238pAcF (named Chain A and Chain B) adopting the almost identical conformation with a rootmean square deviation (rmsd) of 0.171 \u00c5 over 334 equivalent C\u03b1 atoms (Supplementary Fig. 52). Clear electron density corresponding to the ncAA pAcF was unambiguously observed at the amino acid residue 238 site, indicating that the His238 of PikCWT was replaced by pAcF with a very high incorporation efficiency (Fig. 4a), which is consistent with the results of ESI-Q-TOF-MS analysis (Fig. 2c) and tandem mass spectrometry (Supplementary Fig. 2). The overall structure of PikCH238pAcF is virtually identical to the previously determined PikCWT structure in a closed conformation (PDB ID code: 2BVJ, Chain A), with a rmsd of 0.323 \u00c5 over 345 C\u03b1 atoms, which indicates the incorporation of pAcF does not change the overall structure of PikC (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 52).\nTo further gain mechanistic insights into the unique substrate selectivity and hydroxylation pattern of PikCH238pAcF, we solved the crystal structures of 6-bound and 4-bound PikCH238pAcF (SupplementaryFig. 53). Similar to the substrate free PikCH238pAcF structure, in both structures, each crystallographic asymmetric unit has two protein chains (named Chain A and Chain B). There is basically no major conformational difference between Chains A and B (6-bound, rmsd = 0.169 \u00c5; 4-bound, rmsd =0.155\u00c5), all of which are in a closed conformation (Supplementary Fig. 55, Supplementary Figs. 60a, b). Therefore, structures of one representative chain (Chain A) were selected for further analysis.\nIn the crystal structure of PikCH238pAcF in complex with 6 (PDB ID code: 7XBO, 2.2 \u00c5 resolution, Supplementary Table 9), the 12- membered ring macrolactone is unambiguously positioned in the active site, and its electron density is well defined (Supplementary\nFig. 53). Similar to the interactions between the macrolactone portion of 4 in PikCWT (PDB ID code: 2C6H), 6 hydrophobically interacts with the side chains of Leu93, Phe178, Val179, Val242, Ala243, Val290, and Ile395 (Fig. 4b). Consistent with the observation in the 4-bound PikCWT structure, upon binding of the ligand 6, the carboxyl group of Glu246 side chain is flipped away to better accommodate the macrolactone ring of 6 (Fig. 4b, c). Importantly, the carbonyl group of pAcF238 and the C3 hydroxyl group of 6 form a 2.9 \u00c5 hydrogen bond (Fig. 4b). Meanwhile, the terminal methyl group of pAcF238 hydrophobically contacts with the C3 carbon atom and C4 methyl group of\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:1669 4\ncatalyzed by the wild type (WT) and indicated mutant PikC enzymes using 6 (c), 7 (d), 4 (e), and 5 (f) as substrates.

Essentially, these extra interactions would not exist without the incorporation of pAcF into PikC at the position of His238 (Fig. 4b). Therefore, the extra strong hydrogen bond and additional hydrophobic interactions mediated by ncAA in PikCH238pAcF simulate the interactions to someextentmediatedbydesosaminemoiety of4 in the 4-bound PikCWT structure (Fig. 4c) and likely play a vital role in the catalysis of PikCH238pAcF towards the non-natural substrate 6.\nCompared with PikCWT, PikCH238pAcF showed a higher catalytic activity for 4 (Fig. 3e). In the crystal structure of 4-bound PikCH238pAcF (PDB ID code: 7XBN, 2.0\u00c5 resolution, Supplementary Table 9), clear electron density corresponding to the 12-membered ring macrolide 4 is unambiguously observed at the active site (Supplementary Fig. 53). Upon replacement of His238 by the bulkier pAcF, the desosamine sugar is pushed away and tilts 40 degrees, comparing to the conformation of 4 in the substrate binding pocket of PikCWT, in the 4-bound PikCH238pAcF structure. This sugar relocation leads to the loss of the key salt bridge with Glu94 as observed in the 4-bound PikCWT structure, thereby leading 4 to be more perpendicular to the heme plane (Fig. 4d). The majority of hydrophobic interactions between 4 and PikC are conserved in the 4-bound PikCWT and PikCH238pAcF structures, such as the amino acids Trp74, Leu81, Glu85, Met191, and Phe178 to the desosamine moiety, and Leu93, Phe178, Val179, Val242, Ala243, Thr247, Val290, Thr294, Met394, and Ile395 to the macrolactone ring of 4. Due to the relative position change, 4 loses several hydrophobic contacts with PikCH238pAcF via Leu88, Gln89, and Ile239\n(Fig. 4e, f). Although PikCH238pAcF loses some electrostatic and hydrophobic interactions with 4, the presence of pAcF238 also introduces several extra interactions for 4. Specifically, the carbonyl group of pAcF and the carboxyl group of Glu94 form a hydrogen bond network with the C3\u2019 hydroxyl group of desosamine through two water molecules (Fig. 4g), and the methyl group of pAcF238 forms hydrophobic interactions with the C4 and C5\u2019 methyl groups of 4 (Fig. 4e). In addition, the specific position of 4 in PikCH238pAcF also introduces the hydrophobic interaction between desosamine and Tyr295 (Fig. 4e). All these extra interactions likely contribute to the increased binding affinity of PikCH238pAcF towards 4. Further structural analysis revealed that in the 4-bound PikCH238pAcF structure, the loop between F and G helices and the A-B loop become less flexible than in the 4-bound PikCWT structure (Fig. 4h, i). We reason that the positive charge of the protonated C3\u2019 dimethylamino group of desosamine in new position might better interact with the negative charges of the loop between F and G helices (Asp182-Asp183) and the A-B loop (Glu48-Gly49-Asp50Glu51) in the 4-bound PikCH238pAcF structure. These structural features demonstrate a \u201ctighter\u201d bindingmode of 4 in the productive substrate binding pocket of PikCH238pAcF, by which the binding affinity and activity of PikCH238pAcF towards 4 are significantly increased.\nDue to continuous decomposition of 7 in aqueous solution and lower binding affinity than 6, we were unable to solve the crystal structure of 7-bound PikCH238pAcF. Thus, molecular docking with AutoDock vina was performed to explore the binding mode of 7 in\nFig. 5 | Structural analysis of narbonolide (7)-bound and narbomycin (5)-bound PikCH238pAcF. a, b Molecular modeling of 7 within the substrate binding pocket of PikCH238pAcF: comparisons of contacting amino acid side chains around the substrate binding site within 4.5 \u00c5 between 7-bound PikCH238pAcF and substrate-free PikCWT (a) and 5-bound PikCD50N (b).

According to the structural superimpositions of the 7- PikCH238pAcF dockingmodelwith the substrate free PikCWT (Fig. 5a) and with the previously determined structure of a PikCmutant in complex with 5 (i.e., the more active PikCD50N with a productive substrate binding conformation) (Fig. 5b), the 14-membered ring macrolactone is stabilized mainly through hydrophobic interactions between the macrolactone and the amino acids Leu93, Phe178, Val179, Ile239, Val242, Ala243, Thr247, Thr294, and Ile395. Importantly, the carbonyl group of pAcF238 and the C5 hydroxyl group of 7 form a 3.2 \u00c5 hydrogen bond. In addition, the C3 carbonyl group of 7 form a 3.5 \u00c5 hydrogen bond with the carboxy group of Glu94 (Fig. 5a). Taken together, we reason that the hydrophobic interactions and two extra hydrogen bonds likely enable the activity of PikCH238pAcF towards the non-natural substrate 7. Of note, the crystal structure of PikCD50N/5 showed the productive binding pose of the 14-membered ring substrate (PDB ID code: 2VZM, Chain B) rather than the non-productive binding mode seen in the PikCWT/5 complex structure (PDB ID code: 2C7X); therefore, we elected to use the PikCD50N/5 structure as a reference for the following analyses. Since the structures of PikCD50N/5 and PikCWT/5 are virtually identical to each other except for the different 50th residues and alternative substrate binding conformations (Supplementary Fig. 54), we deemed that the comparisons using PikCD50N/5 should be valid.\nPikCH238pAcF also exhibited higher hydroxylation activity towards the 14-membered ring macrolide 5 than PikCWT (Fig. 3f). To elucidate the molecular basis for this observation, we further determined the crystal structure of PikCH238pAcF in complex with 5 in a closed conformation (PDB ID code: 8GUE, 1.9 \u00c5 resolution, Supplementary\nTable 9, Supplementary Figs. 55 and 60c). In the complex structure, clear electron density corresponding to the structure of 5 was unambiguously observed at the active site (Supplementary Fig. 53). The H238pAcF mutation pushes away the desosamine for about 60 degrees in the structure of 5-bound PikCH238pAcF. This substrate repositioning abolishes the salt bridge between desosamine andGlu94 as observed in the PikCWT/5 complex, and rebuilds a salt bridge between desosamine and Glu85 (Fig. 5c). Consistent with the substrate-enzyme interactions between 5 and PikCWT, 5 in PikCH238pAcF is also stabilized through a number of hydrophobic interactions with the amino acids Leu81, Leu93, Phe178, Val179, Ile239, Val242, Ala243, Thr247, Val290, Thr294,Met394, Ile395, Trp74, andMet191. Due to the relative position change, 5 loses several hydrophobic contacts with Leu88 and Gln89. Nevertheless, there in PikCH238pAcF/5 exists an extra hydrophobic contact between the desosamine moiety and Tyr295. Importantly, in the PikCH238pAcF structure in complex with 5, pAcF238 introduces more hydrophobic interactions through the methyl group of this ncAA with the C5\u2019methyl group of the desosamine moiety and the C6 methyl group of the macrolactone ring (Fig. 5d, e). Moreover, three water molecules were found to mediate a hydrogen bond network between the pAcF carbonyl, Glu94 carboxyl and C3\u2019 hydroxyl groupofdesosamine in the co-crystal structure (Fig. 5f). Therefore, the hydrophobic interactionsmediatedbypAcF238, Tyr295 and thewatermediated hydrogen bond network likely make the main contribution to the increased binding affinity of PikCH238pAcF towards 5.\nProbing the structural basis for the regioselectivity of PikCH238pAcF In addition to the broadened substrate scope and increased catalytic activity, PikCH238pAcF also exhibits significantly improved regioselectivity for the C10 hydroxylation of both 4 (Fig. 3e) and 6 (Fig. 3c). As previously observed19, in the PikCWT/4 complex, the allylic C10 and methylene C12 positions are 7.2 \u00c5 and 5.1 \u00c5 away from the heme-iron reactive center, respectively (Fig. 4j, Supplementary Fig. 61a). This observation did not directly explain the equal distribution of the two hydroxylation products 1 and 2 because the hydroxylation pattern could be determined by multiple factors, such as the substrate\nrepositioning resulted from the catalytic oxygen bonding and/or interaction with redox partner protein, differential bond dissociation energy of the C-H bonds to be oxidized, and protein dynamics that cannot be observed in crystal structures. Nonetheless, a correlation between the C10- and C12-to-iron distances and the hydroxylation product ratio could still be established. Upon examination of the complex structures of PikCH238pAcF/4 and PikCH238pAcF/6, we found that the distances between the C10 atom (of 4 and 6) and the hemeiron reactive center are significantly shortened to 6.7 and 6.8 \u00c5, respectively, when compared to the corresponding distance of 7.2 \u00c5 observed in the PikCWT/4 complex structure; while the corresponding C12-to-iron distances are 5.3 and 5.4 \u00c5 (for 4 and 6, respectively), longer than the corresponding distance of 5.1 \u00c5 in the PikCWT/4 complex structure (Fig. 4j, Supplementary Figs. 61a\u2013c). These distance changes might reflect the disruption of the original balance between the two hydroxylation sites of C10 and C12, thus leading to the shifted regio-preference to C10 position.\nUnlike the different regioselectivity of PikCH238pAcF and PikCWT towards 4 and 6, PikCH238pAcF displayed similar regioselectivity to 5 and 7 as PikCWT and the more active mutant of PikCD50N20. Comparatively, the distances between the C12 atom and the heme-iron reactive center are 7.4 \u00c5 in both complex structures of PikCH238pAcF/5 and PikCD50N/5 (reflecting the productive binding of 5 to PikCWT20 as described above); while the corresponding C14-to-iron distances are 5.3 \u00c5 (PikCH238pAcF/5) and 5.5 \u00c5 (PikCD50N/5), respectively, basically remains unchanged (Supplementary Fig. 56, Supplementary Figs. 61d, e). Biochemically, the farther (relative to heme-iron) C12 C-H bond instead of the closer C14 C-H bond is the preferred hydroxylation site perhaps due to the lower bond dissociation energy of the C12 allylic C-H bond and the unfavorable orientation of the C14 C-H bond19,20. The docking analysis of PikCH238pAcF/7 demonstrates a similar C12-to-iron distance (7.3 \u00c5) as observed in both complex structures (Supplementary Fig. 56). These observations may explain the same regioselectivity of PikCH238pAcF and PikCWT towards 5 and 7.\nEngineering of a strict aglycone hydroxylase Next, we attempted to engineer PikCH238pAcF to be a strict hydroxylase of 6 and 7 by aborting the activity towards both 4 and 5. Of note, a unique substrate anchoringmechanismof PikC has been unravelled by Sherman and co-workers19\u201321. Briefly, the acidic side chain of Glu94 is responsible for forming a salt bridge with the positively charged C3\u2019dimethylamino group of desosamine in 4 and 5. Glu85, another acidic residue to sandwich the C3\u2019-dimethylamino group together with Glu94, is also critical for both 4- and 5-hydroxylating activities and shows some synergistic effect with Glu9419,20.\nThus, we elected to mutate Glu94 and/or Glu85 to either glutamine or alanine in combination with the H238pAcF mutation. Consistent with the previous reports19,20, the substrate conversion ratios of the four single mutants including PikCE85Q, PikCE85A, PikCE94Q, and PikCE94A towards 4/5 were reduced from 45.0 \u00b1 4.5%/54.4 \u00b1 2.8% (PikCWT) to 38.5 \u00b1 3.1%/27.5 \u00b1 4.4%, 43.3 \u00b1 3.8%/25.8 \u00b1 1.9%, 14.2 \u00b1 4.7%/ 18.6 \u00b1 4.6%, and 8.2 \u00b1 2.7%/34.0 \u00b1 4.8%, respectively; while the four double mutants PikCE85A/E94A, PikCE85A/E94Q, PikCE85Q/E94A, and PikCE85Q/E94Q almost entirely lost their activities. Unsurprisingly, all these single/double mutants were inactive to 6 and 7 (Supplementary\nFig. 57).When the PikCH238pAcFmutationwas introduced into these less active mutants, all double and triple mutants displayed the C10hydroxylation activity towards 6 and C12-hydroxylation activity towards 7 (Fig. 3c, d, Supplementary Fig. 57). In particular, the triple mutant PikCH238pAcF/E85Q/E94Q almost entirely lost the activity towards both 4 and 5, but showed 12.0 \u00b1 0.5% and 13.4 \u00b1 2.4% conversion ratios for6 and 7, respectively. Interestingly, comparedwith PikCH238pAcF, the doublemutant PikCH238pAcF/E85Q exhibited 0.4- and 0.5-fold increase in the hydroxylation activity towards 6 and 7 (Fig. 3c, d) for unknown\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:1669 8\nreasons. However, it retained significant activities towards 4 (52.2 \u00b1 2.8% conversion) and 5 (94.3 \u00b1 3.1% conversion) (Fig. 3e, f). Consistently, the binding affinities of PikCH238pAcF/E85Q to 6 and 7 increased by 0.3 and 0.4 times, respectively, compared to those of PikCH238pAcF (Supplementary Table 1).\nEstablishing an artificial enzyme cascade for unnatural macrolides With the PikCH238pAcF/E85Q mutant, we sought to establish an artificial enzyme cascade in vitro with an oxidation-glycosylation order (Fig. 6a, b), which would reverse the natural glycosylation-oxidation order in the late pikromycin biosynthetic pathway, which is sequentially mediated by the glycosyltransferase DesVII and P450 PikC (Fig. 1a). First, the in vitro hydroxylation reactions of 6 and 7 by PikCH238pAcF/ E85Q were optimized by adding glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (GDH) and glucose for NADPH regeneration and extending the reaction time from 40min to 4 h. As a result, the conversions of 6 and 7 achieved 75.3% and 78.0%, respectively (Fig. 6c, d). Second, we tested the glycosylation activities of six UDP-dependent glycosyltransferases towards the hydroxylated macrolactones 8 and 10 by using UDPglucose as the sugar donor, including UGT85A132, RrUGT1733, RrUGT333, UGT72B1434, UGT73B6FS and BSGT-135,36. BSGT-1 turned out to be the only active enzyme, glucosylating8 and 10 intomethynolide3-O-glucoside (11), O3,O2\u2019-di-glucosyl-methynolide (12) and pikronolide-5-O-glucoside (13) (Fig. 6a, b; see Supplementary Figs. 23\u201339 for structural determination). Due to the incomplete oxidation of 6 and 7, the unreacted 6 and 7 were also glucosylated by BSGT-1,\ndemonstrating the extraordinary substrate promiscuity of this UGT. Unsurprisingly, the resulting products 14 and 15 (i.e., 10-deoxymethynolide-3-O-glucoside and narbonolide-5-O-glucoside, see Supplementary Figs. 40\u201350 for structural determination) cannot be recognized by PikCH238pAcF/E85Q (Supplementary Fig. 58)."

            "text": "Selective C-H bond oxidation remains a central challenge in synthetic chemistry21,37. To address this issue, tremendous efforts on enzyme engineering of cytochrome P450 enzymes have beenmade in order to improve the activity, substrate scope, stability, robustness, and other catalytic properties of these selective biocatalysts for practical biooxidation7,38\u201347. To engineer the P450mutants with desired properties, a variety of effective mutagenesis strategies such as CAST, CAST/ISM, and FRISM have been developed with great successes achieved48\u201350. However, the 20 proteinogenic amino acids cannot always satisfy the requirement of site-directed and/or randommutagenesis and rational protein design in terms of steric, topological and electronic properties or other inspiring reactivity. Therefore, appropriate ribosomal incorporation of ncAAs in a site-specific manner, which could be designed on demand theoretically, has shown significant possibilities to overcome the limit of conventional protein mutagenesis51\u201354.\nCompared with extensive studies on ncAA-based protein engineering for protein labeling, crosslinking, photo-activation, bioorthogonal conjugation and other purposes52, the use of ncAA mutagenesis to tailor the catalytic activities of diverse enzymes, especially P450 enzymes, remains largely underexplored. Among few examples, NMR-\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:1669 9\nactive ncAAs were incorporated into P450 enzymes to illuminate the role of conformational dynamics55. Recently, Kolev et al. utilized four ncAAs to scan the 11 active-site positions of CYP102A1, leading to unusual changes in regioselectivity and catalytic efficiency25. This pioneering and inspiring exploration represents the first semi-rational engineering of P450 active site using ncAAs in a site-specific manner.\nAiming to change the substrate specificity of a biosynthetic P450 enzyme (PikC) from the sugar-appended macrolides (4 and 5) to the corresponding aglycones (6 and 7), in this study, we successfully engineered a number of ncAA-containing PikC mutants that are capable of selectively hydroxylating 6 at C10 position. PikCH238pAcF, as the most efficient C10-hydroxylase of 6, was also the only mutant enzyme to catalyze the C12-hydroxylation of 7 giving rise to 10. Further structural analysis provided mechanistic basis for the ability of PikCH238pAcF to selectively catalyze the hydroxylation of 6 and 7. We envision that our functional, crystallographic, and mechanistic study will advance the engineering of cytochrome P450 enzymes using ncAAs.\nThe relevant mechanisms were elucidated by comparative analysis of four crystal structures of PikCH238pAcF. As the best ncAA substituent, pAcF creates a specific binding strategy for 6 and 7. In PikCWT, the desosamine sugar acts as a substrate anchor by forming a key salt bridge between the dimethylamino group and the acidic amino acid residue and a network of hydrogen bonds with the native substrate 4 or 519,20. In PikCH238pAcF, the benzylic carbonyl group and terminal methyl groups respectively provide the hydrogen bond and hydrophobic contacts with the macrolactone ring of 6 or 7 without the desosamine anchor (Figs. 4 and 5). In this scenario, the methyl keto moiety ofpAcF,which cannot beprovidedby anyproteinogenic amino acids, is essential for productive binding of the two aglycones.\nIn natural product biosynthetic pathways, the order of enzymatic steps is usually fixed to prevent metabolic flux leaking. However, a locked pathway would limit pathway reprogramming for structural diversification. Using the ncAA-engineered macrolactone hydroxylase PikCH238pAcF, we successfully reversed the natural glycosylationoxidation order of late pikromycin biosynthetic pathway, by which it becomes feasible to attach different sugars to the aforehand oxidized macrolactone (Fig. 6). Otherwise, the GT-mediated attachment of a non-desosamine sugar to 6 or 7, which was previously achieved by Borisova et al.56, would disable PikC since desosamine (or a dimethylamino group) is required for PikC\u2019s activity19,20. Thus, we envision that the substrate flexibility of GTs could be better harnessed for generation of more macrolides through changing the macrolide-oxidizing P450s into macrolactone-tailoring P450s by similar ncAAmutagenesis approaches in the future. Since glycosylation and oxidation can improve the properties of a compound in terms of aqueous solubility, biological activity, bioavailability and hence druggability56, a better coordinated biosynthetic glycosylation and oxidation that is enabled by ncAA mutagenesis would likely benefit the future drug development.\nIn conclusion, herein we practiced the semi-rational ncAA mutagenesis for a natural product biosynthetic P450enzyme.We conceived and realized a unique binding strategy for two unnatural substrates in PikC based on their structural characteristics, which also improved the catalytic performance towards natural substrates. With the unnatural macrolactone hydroxylating activities, PikCH238pAcF was employed to rewire the pikromycin biosynthetic pathway in vitro. The strategy of ncAA-based P450 enzyme engineering and the mechanisms gained fromdetailed structural analysis of enzyme-substrate complexes could be applied in more glycosylation-oxidation coupled systems in the future. Furthermore, this kind of biosynthetic pathway reprogramming may also be performed in vivo given that the required ncAA can be supplied by feeding or in situ biosynthesis57. With the useful toolkit of ncAAs, we anticipate that more fine-tuning enzymatic reactions or cascades will be created andmore rationally designed natural product derivatives could be produced."
