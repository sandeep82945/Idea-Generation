Despite the wide number of available medications, treating MDD remains an important challenge. Although fluoxetine (Flx) is the most frequently prescribed antidepressant, its mode of action is still unknown. To delineate affected molecular pathways of depressive-like behavior and identify potential targets upon Flx treatment, we performed a comparative proteomic analysis of hippocampal purified synaptic terminals (synaptosomes) of rats exposed to six weeks of CSIS, an animal model of depression, and/or followed by Flx treatment (lasting three weeks of six-week CSIS) to explore synaptic protein profile changes. Results showed that Flx in controls mainly induced decreased expression of proteins involved in energy metabolism and the redox system. CSIS led to increased expression of proteins that mainly participate in Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (Camk2)-related neurotransmission, vesicle transport, and ubiquitination. Flx treatment of CSIS rats predominantly increased expression of proteins involved in synaptic vesicle trafficking (exocytosis and endocytosis), and energy metabolism (glycolytic and mitochondrial respiration). Overall, these Flx-regulated changes in synaptic and mitochondrial proteins of CSIS rats might be critical targets for new therapeutic development for the",

            "text": "Chronic psychosocial stress is one risk factor for developing major depressive disorder (MDD). Its etiology is not yet fully elucidated, but several reports indicate synaptic and mitochondrial dysfunctions [1,2]. Hence, impaired neurotransmission of monoaminergic pathways, including serotonin, has been reported in MDD [3,4]. Clinical and preclinical studies showed reduced inhibitory neurotransmitter \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamic acid decarboxylase 67 (GAD67) levels in the brain, including decreased protein expression of parvalbumin as GABAergic interneuron [5,6]. A study in a chronic mild stressbased animal model of depression showed impairment of glutamate/GABA presynaptic release, brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA trafficking in dendrites, and reduced length of apical dendrites in CA3 pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus [7]. In addition, various models of chronic stress exposure in rodents have indicated a reduction in neurogenesis in the hippocampal dentate gyrus (DG) [8]. Moreover, mitochondrial dysfunction that results in decreased electron transport chain (ETC) and ATP production, impaired bioenergetics capacity, and increased oxidative stress and apoptosis, appears to be contributing a factor in the etiopathogenesis of MDD [1,9,10]. Experimental data suggest\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 15351. https://doi.org/10.3390/ijms232315351 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/ijms\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 15351 2 of 16\na critical role of synaptic mitochondria in synaptic vesicle pools function and organization and neurotransmitter release during intense neuronal activity [11]. Therefore, intensive research on MDD is focused on finding molecular mechanisms in brain synapses. For the treatment of MDD, fluoxetine (Flx), as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), is the most frequently prescribed antidepressant [12] which inhibits serotonin reuptake by blocking serotonin transporters, resulting in increased serotonin synaptic levels. Independent of serotonin reuptake blockade, Flx exerts therapeutic effects by promoting neuronal plasticity through its direct binding to the tropomyosin-related receptor kinase B (TrkB), which is a cholesterol-sensitive receptor [13] and receptor for BDNF [14]. Its administration in mice induces changes in synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus and functional dynamics associated with changes in hippocampal-dependent behavior and expression of synaptic proteins that regulate neurotransmitter turnover and release [15]. Notably, Flx interacts with mitochondria, altering their function by modulating the protein expression and activity of respiratory chain components and enzymes of the citrate cycle (TCA) [16,17]. Moreover, Flx rapidly blocks serotonin reuptake, but the onset of the therapeutic response is delayed by several weeks [18], indicating that its chronic treatment requires optimization. Hence, the synaptic dysfunctions observed in clinical and preclinical studies might represent a novel therapeutic target. In our study, we used chronic social isolation (CSIS) as a validated rat model of depression [19\u201322]. We previously demonstrated that rats exposed to CSIS showed anhedonia, a key symptom of MDD (reduction in sucrose preference test), behavioral despair (increased immobility time in the forced swim test), and anxiety symptoms (increased the burying of marbles) [23\u201325]. To delineate affected molecular pathways of depressive-like behavior and to identify potential molecular markers/targets upon Flx treatment, we carried out a nonhypothesisdriven comparative proteomic analysis of hippocampal purified synaptic terminals (synaptosomes) of rats exposed to six weeks of CSIS and/or followed by Flx treatment (lasting three weeks of six-week CSIS) to explore synaptic protein profile changes. Synaptosomes were used since they represent isolated synaptic terminals from neurons that contain mitochondria, synaptic vesicles, and postsynaptic density [26]. In this study, we chose the hippocampus, a brain structure that shows profound alterations in MDD, particularly of altered neural plasticity in response to stress, which plays a role in the onset and development of MDD [27,28]. Moreover, this brain region represents a key target of serotonergic afferents [29]. So far, no studies have examined synaptoproteome in the hippocampus of adult male CSIS rats and/or followed by Flx treatment. Western blot analysis was carried out to validate the proteins representative of altered signal pathways. The identified altered molecular pathways and synaptosomal proteins might be used as potential molecular markers/targets in studying the hippocampal synaptic function and further clarifying the mechanism of MDD and antidepressant action."

In Controls treated with Flx vs. Control rats, a significant interaction among downregulated proteins was revealed with enrichment p < 1 \u00d7 10\u221216. Flx mainly induced downregulation of the proteins related to malate metabolic process, tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and NADH metabolic process. The malate dehydrogenase activity and anion binding as molecular functions were found. Significant enrichment KEGG pathways were pyruvate metabolism and TCA cycle. CSIS induced the changes in protein expression with no significant interactions observed within upregulated synaptosomal proteins with no specific biological process and molecular function. In Flx-treated CSIS compared with CSIS rats, a significant interaction among upregulated synaptosomal proteins was found, with enrichment p < 1 \u00d7 10\u221216. In the aspect of biological process, these proteins mainly take part in the regulation of synaptic vesicle recycling and ATP biosynthetic process and transport, specifically those involved in protein transport (intracellular and vesicle-mediated transport in synapse). In the aspect of molecular function, they possess anion binding with synaptic vesicle cycle as a KEGG pathway. A schematic representation of a STRING-based interactome map of interactions among synaptosomal downregulated proteins in Controls treated to Flx with the most significant biological processes is presented in Figure 1.

            "text": "Synaptic dysfunction in MDD might be caused by the underlying changes in the expression of proteins. Hence, we profiled a nonhypothesis-driven comparative hippocampal synaptosomal proteome changes representative of the time-depende t expression changes underlying the dev lopment of CSIS-induced depressive-like behavior and Flx fficacy and identified affected signaling pathways and proteins following CSIS and/or Flx treatment. Bioinformatics analysis of proteomic data demonstrated reduced expression of proteins in Flx-treated control rats (Table 1). Decreased expression levels of enzymes Eno1 (f.c. 0.78) and Aldoa (f.c. 0.75) involved in the glycolytic pathway, Mdh2 (f.c. 0.68) and Pdhb (f.c. 0.74) involved in TCA cycle, and two subunits composing ETC such as Atp5f1a (f.c. 0.80) and Cox6b1 (f.c. 0.50) were found. In support of these, decreased expression of CkB (f.c. 0.70), the energy storage enzyme which catalyzes the reversible exchange of high-energy phosphate, was revealed. Reduced xpression of roteins involved in energy metabolism may reflect regulatory mechanisms in cells designed to limit unrestrained glucose consumption. We recently reported that Flx in the hippocampus of control rats stimulates energy metabolism by upregulating cytosolic GAPDH expression and directs energy metabolism toward the TCA and oxidative phosphorylation in nonsynaptic mitochondria (NSM) [16]. Differently obtained data may result in a different effect of Flx on the cell type of mitochondria (NSM vs. syn ptic itochondria). Flx treatment also altered the oxido-reduc n proc ss and downregulated protein expression of Gstp1 (f.c. 0.63) and Prdx3 (f.c. 0.65) involved in antioxidative defenses. CSIS in control rats resulted in significant upregulation of synaptosomal proteins (Table 2). We found upregulated expression of Camk2a (f.c. 1.72), a protein that mediates intracellular signaling cascades and contributes to synaptic transmission as well as longterm potentiation (LTP) maintenance. Autophosphorylation of Camk2a is required for LTP and long-term memory [30]. Moreover, autophosphorylated Camk2a phosphorylates the AMPA-type glutamate receptor subunit GluA1, required for expression of LTP at mature\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 15351 9 of 16\nhippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells [31,32]. In our study, increased expression of Camk2a may be associated with an attempt to overcome the stress condition. CSIS also increased the expression of ATP8 (f.c. 5.77) (subunits of ATP synthase, Complex V) that catalyzes the formation of ATP from ADP and phosphate using the electrochemical gradient of protons across the inner mitochondrial membrane. This upregulation may increase ATP synthesis as a stress-coping mechanism in CSIS rats. Previous studies demonstrated that alterations in mitochondrial-mediated mechanisms might play a role in depression [21,33]. Nonetheless, we also found increased levels of Hspe1 (f.c. 2.1), chaperones involved in the processes of protein transport and assembly of multi-subunit protein complex that cause ATP consumption. Additionally, increased expression of polyubiquitin (f.c. 1.68) that serves as recognition signals for the proteasome was revealed. Contrary to this report, downregulated proteins involved in the ubiquitination process, as a part of the proteasome system, were found in the cytosol of the hippocampus of rats following CSIS. Moreover, differential expression patterns of the members of the ubiquitination family in response to CSIS probably depend on their subcellular compartments. However, given that expression of synaptosomal proteins following CSIS was increased, whereby the ubiquitinproteasome pathway has a significant role in synaptic plasticity [34], it is likely to expect an increased participation/role of the chaperone/ubiquitous systems. By comparing Flx-treated CSIS and CSIS rats, synaptoproteome changes showed mainly upregulated protein expressions (Table 3). We found upregulated expression of proteins involved in vesicle-mediated transport in the synapse and synapse vesicle recycling (Dpysl2, Rab3a, Hspa8, Sh3gl2, Syt1 and Dnm1, f.c. 1.51\u20131.89). Moreover, the release of the neurotransmitters is primarily regulated by the presynaptic exo-endocytic cycle [35]. Hence, several proteins involved in synaptic vesicle exocytosis (Rab3a, Nsf, Syt1, and Ppp3ca, f.c. 1.52\u20132.15) and endocytosis (Hspa8, Sh3gl2, Syt1, Dnm1, f.c. 1.57\u20131.89) were upregulated. Synaptotagmin-1 (Syt1, f.c. 1.85), a synaptic vesicle protein, serves as a dual Ca2+ sensor for exocytosis and endocytosis [36]. It triggers vesicle release [37] along with Rab (f,c, 1.52) proteins involved in vesicle docking [38] and Nsf (1.57) that regulates the neurotransmitter release and maintains the readily releasable pool of synaptic vesicles [39]. Our data are corroborated by a study demonstrating that chronic Flx treatment is associated with increased expression of proteins related to vesicular trafficking and release, such as Syt1 [15]. Nonetheless, Ap2a1 and Ap2b1 (f.c. 1.76\u20132.20), as parts of the AP-2 complex involved in the recycling process of synaptic vesicles, along with Clct (f.c. 1.88) that forms clathrin-coated vesicles at the plasma membrane [40] and Dnm1 (f.c. 1.89), implicated in endocytotic synaptic vesicles fission at the presynaptic plasma membrane [41], were upregulated. This is supported by upregulated endophilins (Sh3gl2, Sh3glb2, f.c. 1.69\u20131.72) as a component of clathrin-mediated endocytosis [42]. Taken together, Flxinduced increase in expression of synaptic proteins involved in exo/endocytosis in the CSIS rats might reflect a dynamic response to changes in synaptic stimulation, allowing neurons to maintain the necessary level of neurotransmitters and resembles the effect of common antidepressant action. Flx in CSIS rats resulted in increased expression of proteins involved in synaptic mitochondria bioenergetic pathways. Several of these proteins are involved in TCA cycle (Mdh1, Ogdh, f.c. 1.53\u20131.69), ETC Complexes I (Ndufv1, f.c. 1.60), and V (Atp5f1a, Atp5f1b, f.c. 2.03\u20132.21), indicating the Flx-induced increase in synaptic mitochondrial energy production is a protective effect. Upregulated protein expression of V-type proton (H+) ATPase (V-ATPase) (Atp6v1a, Atp6v1e1, Atp6v1h, f.c. 1.55\u20132.20), which generates a proton gradient across the vesicular membrane, likely increases active transport of neurotransmitters into synaptic vesicles and synaptic transmission [43,44]. However, our results showed downregulated proteins of two subunits, such as Ndufa2 (complex I, f.c. 0.73) and Atp5me (Complex V, f.c. 0.36). Regardless of how expression changes occur, the effect of Flx on synaptic energy metabolism will depend on enzyme activities. Nonetheless, the levels of Mdh1 (f.c. 1.53) and aspartate aminotransferase, mitochondrial (AATM or Got2 (f.c. 1.72)) involved in the malate-aspartate shuttle were in-\nInt. J. Mol. Sci. 2022, 23, 15351 10 of 16\ncreased, whereby expression change of AATM, validated by Western blot analysis (1.8 f.c.) (Figure 3A), is in accordance with proteomic data. This shuttle promotes transport of cytosolic NADH into the mitochondria, whereby regulation of NAD+/NADH ratio aids oxidative metabolism of glucose and synthesis of neurotransmitter glutamate from glutamine in the brain [45]. Interestingly, we found increased expression of Kyat3 (f.c.1.86) enzyme that catalyzes the irreversible transamination of L-kynurenine, a product of tryptophan metabolism, to the neuroprotective glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenic acid (KYNA). In support of this, AATM (f.c. 1.72) also plays a role in KYNA formation [46]. Moreover, future studies will examine the targeting possible pathways responsible for these mechanisms of action. Importantly, proteins involved in intracellular protein transport (Hsp90aa1, Gdi1, Ywhae, Pde2a, f.c. 1.56\u20131.82) and chaperone-mediated protein transport (Hspd1, Hsp90aa1, Hspa8, f.c. 1.54\u20131.57) were upregulated. Regarding Hsp90aa1, Western blot analysis confirmed increased expression of proteomic data (2.4 f.c.) (Figure 3B). Chaperones are required for proper protein folding and transport, consuming ATP in their function [47]. This result might be an adaptive change of the cell attempting to assemble individual proteins into functional complexes. In contrast, HSP10, a chaperone with the same role, was downregulated. Due to the disordered nature of unfolded or aggregated proteins, most probably different chaperones will be included in targeting misfolded proteins. Comparing the results between CSIS vs. Controls and CSIS + Flx vs. CSIS, only two proteins, Ppp2r1a and Hspe1, were upregulated by CSIS (Supplementary Table S1). The reason could lie in altered homeostasis of CSIS rats, causing different sensitivity of cells to the treatment. Comparing Flx-treated controls with Flx-treated CSIS, Flx additionally stimulated the expression of four proteins in CSIS rats (Supplementary Table S2) involved in energy processes.\nLimitation\nThere are two limitations to the current study. First, proteomic data obtained from LC-MS/MS analysis were derived from a single determination performed on one pooled sample of each experimental group, and therefore appropriate statistical analysis was not performed. Even though sample pooling does not provide a characterization of biological variance, the pooling approach is a preferable approach to reliably indicate a common pattern in the expression of proteins [48]. Second, although LC-MS/MS analysis includes the entire hippocampus, an anatomically defined brain area, it will be important to examine its dorsal and ventral part which may play significantly different roles in cognitive functions, and also likely in MDD. Therefore, any results we gain from molecular studies such as this cannot be readily applied as a \u201cfunction\u201d of the \u201centire\u201d hippocampus."

A comparison of CSIS and control rats showed upregulation of synaptosomal protein expression mainly participating in Camk2-related neurotransmission, vesicle transport, ubiquitination, and mitochondrial energy processes. Flx application to CSIS rats predominantly increases vesicle trafficking and mitochondrial bioenergetics, which might be the potential targets for therapeutic treatments in MDD. The identified synaptic and mitochondrial proteins and altered molecular pathways suggest them as potential synaptic markers and targets for Flx treatments and potentially crucial for the effective treatment of stress-related MDD.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/ijms232315351/s1, Table S1.
