1. **Investigate the effectiveness of the rule-based method and GPT-4 in evaluating educational MCQs in different contexts.** This could include using different datasets, such as questions from different grade levels or subject areas, or questions that are generated by different methods, such as automated question generation systems.


2. **Explore the use of other natural language processing (NLP) models for evaluating educational MCQs.** This could include models that are specifically designed for educational tasks, such as question answering or text summarization.


3. **Investigate the use of machine learning methods to automatically identify item-writing flaws in educational MCQs.** This could involve training a classifier on a dataset of questions that have been annotated with item-writing flaws.


4. **Develop a tool that can be used by teachers and students to automatically evaluate the quality of educational MCQs.** This tool could be used to provide feedback on student-generated questions or to help teachers identify questions that are likely to be problematic.


5. **Conduct a study to investigate the impact of using automatic methods to evaluate educational MCQs on student learning.** This could involve comparing the performance of students who are given feedback on their questions from an automatic method to the performance of students who do not receive feedback.
