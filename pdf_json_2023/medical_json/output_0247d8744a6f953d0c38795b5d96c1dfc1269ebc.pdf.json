A questionnaire was disseminated to 1,573 participants (51.7% men) between December 2020 and March 2021. The questionnaire items included psychological distress (using the 6-item Kessler Psychological Distress Scale [K6]), leisure-time exercise, and socioeconomic status. Multivariate analyses were conducted using logistic regression analysis for each age group.\nResults: We found that 47.4% of 20\u201339-year-olds, 40.6% of 40\u201364-year-olds, and 28.3% of 65\u201385-year-olds experienced psychological distress (K6: \u22655 points). For those aged 20\u201339 years, leisure-time exercise (odds ratio [OR] (95% confidence interval) = 0.45 (0.28\u20130.73)) and higher annual household income [0.53 (0.32\u20130.90)] were associated with less psychological distress. For those aged 40\u201364 years, older age was associated with less psychological distress, while fulltime work [1.98 (1.05\u20139.71)] was associated with more psychological distress. In the 65\u201385-year age group, higher education and higher annual income tended to be\u00a0associated with less psychological distress. For those over 40 years of age, living with other(s) was associated with reduced psychological distress."

Moreover, several systematic reviews and metaanalyses have reported strong evidence that regular PA and exercise interventions reduce the risk and symptoms of anxiety and depression. For example, a meta-analysis of 25 randomized controlled trials of exercise interventions for patients with depression concluded that exercise is an evidence-based treatment for depression (2). Additionally, a meta-analysis of 49 prospective studies concluded that PA can prevent the onset of depression, regardless of age or region (3). Another meta-analysis suggested that engaging in PA protects against anxiety symptoms and disorders (4).\nDespite this evidence, inactive lifestyles are common worldwide. The global economic burden of physical inactivity is significant. If the prevalence of physical inactivity remains unchanged, nearly 500 million new and preventable cases of non-communicable diseases and mental health problems are projected to occur between 2020 and 2030, with direct health-care costs reaching international $520 billion (5). Furthermore, people\u2019s daily lives have been severely constrained by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Lockdown and other measures to prevent COVID-19 infection forced people to reduce their range of activities, which reduced PA (6, 7) and affected mental health (8). In a meta-analysis of 20 studies from 12 countries that examined step counts before and after the COVID-19 pandemic, the percentage of studies that included participants with more than 7,000 steps per day decreased from 70% (before the pandemic) to 25% (during the confinement period). Daily step counts decreased by approximately 2,000 steps on average (7). An estimated 53.2 million (27.6%) more people worldwide had depression and 76.2 million (25.6%) more people had anxiety when compared to prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and daily trends in infection rates and reduced human mobility (indicators of the impact of COVID-19) were associated with an increased prevalence of major depressive disorder and anxiety disorders (8). A rapid systematic review examining the association between PA and depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic found that people with longer periods of moderate-to-vigorous PA were 12\u201332% and 15\u201334% less likely to experience depression and anxiety, respectively (9). In addition, a study of university students reported that those with greater reductions in PA had worse mental health (10), and lower PA and less time spent outdoors were associated with higher anxiety and depression scores (11). Moreover, regular moderate-to-vigorous-intensity leisure-time exercise has been recommended to maintain and improve mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic (12).\nIn planning mental health policies, the characteristics of individuals at high risk for mental disorders should be\u00a0evaluated by generation, taking into account the social environment and the social security systems of each country. In an Austrian online survey, the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent lockdowns were particularly stressful for the young adult (<35 years of age), female, unemployed, low-income, and inactive populations (13). Studies examining the association between psychological distress and sociodemographic factors in the COVID-19 pandemic among the general population in Japan have identified the presence of a spouse (14), high annual household income (14, 15), and higher educational attainment (14, 15) as positive relevant factors. However, most of the previous studies have used web-based surveys and exhibited notable selection bias. This study was conducted on the general population in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, and it may be\u00a0 directly useful in addressing the mental health concerns of this prefecture\u2019s residents. In addition, moderate-to-vigorous-intensity leisure-time exercise, which is effective in maintaining and improving mental health should be\u00a0 evaluated. In this study, we\u00a0 aimed to clarify the relationship between psychological distress and leisure-time exercise/ socioeconomic status by age group, utilizing data from citizens who participated in a cohort study in Japan during the COVID-19 pandemic."

At the Kanagawa Cancer Center Research Institute (KCC), baseline recruitment began in 2016 and the baseline survey will continue through 2023. Participants in the ME-BYO cohort were aged 20\u201385 years and lived or worked in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan.\nThe data were obtained from participants recruited from December 2020 to March 2021 from two sites: the Driver\u2019s License Examination Center of Kanagawa Prefecture in Yokohama city and a manufacturing company located in Hiratsuka city, Kanagawa, Japan.

At the second site, employees were sent an invitation to participate in the study along with a request for informed consent. Recruitment was conducted in conjunction with research to clarify the subclinical infection rate in the general population. Thus, persons without a history of COVID-19 were eligible. The history of infection was confirmed by self-report based on whether the participants had ever tested positive by polymerase chain reaction or antigen tests for SARS-CoV-2 (19).\nA total of 1,573 participants in the ME-BYO cohort were recruited during the study period. Participants were instructed to respond to two questionnaires: (1) a baseline questionnaire for the genomic cohort study and (2) a questionnaire to clarify the subclinical infection rate in the general population (additional baseline questionnaire). Completion of both questionnaires was mandatory for participation in the study."

We\u00a0used a Japanese version of the scale (21) translated and validated from the original scale developed in English (20). The participants were then divided into two groups: those with high scores (poor mental health conditions: \u2265 5 points) and those with low scores (good mental health conditions: \u2264 4 points). Similarly, several previous studies have used a cut-off value of 5 points for this scale (16, 22, 23).\nThe frequency categories (assigned average days per week in parentheses) for moderate-to-vigorous leisure-time exercise were as follows: almost none (0), one to three times per month (0.1), one to two times per week (0.2), three to four times per week (0.5), and more than 5 times per week (0.8). The average duration categories (assigned hours per activity in parentheses) were as follows: <30 min (0.3), 30 min to <1 h (0.8), 1 to <2 h (1.5), 2 to <3 h (2.5), 3 to <4 h (3.5), and \u2265 4 h (4.5).\nLeisure-time exercise was assessed by metabolic equivalents (METs) of leisure-time exercise. Participants were asked about the frequency and average duration of exercise behavior according to three broad categories of intensity (vigorous, moderate, and light). Vigorous activities, defined as those that cause a person to breathe more heavily than normal (to the extent that they cannot talk), were allocated 8.0 METs; moderate activities, defined as those that cause a person to breathe somewhat more heavily than normal (to the extent that they can still talk), were allocated 4.0 METs; and light activities, defined as those that cause a person to breathe normally (e.g., walking), were allocated 3.3 METs (24, 25). The minutes per week of leisure-time exercise were calculated using the weekly frequency and duration of leisure-time exercise. Leisure-time exercise was classified into two groups: not performed and performed.\nData on age, sex, height, weight, and living arrangement (living alone or living with other(s)) were collected as basic attributes. Age was classified into three categories based on the Japanese health examination classification for the analyses (20\u201339, 40\u201364, and 65\u201385 years). Socioeconomic status was determined based on the following parameters: educational attainment (up to junior college/ technical school, college degree, or higher), employment type (unemployed, part-time, or full-time), and annual household income. Annual household income was categorized into two groups based on the median (\u22646, >6 million yen/year [~45 thousand US dollars])."

Multivariate analyses were conducted using logistic regression analysis for each age group with the K6 score as the dependent variable and age, sex, living arrangement, leisure-time exercise, educational attainment, employment type, and annual household income as independent variables. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by inputting missing data using multiple imputation methods to create ten complete datasets for separate analyses (26).

In contrast, among those aged 40\u201364 years, full-time work was associated with increased psychological distress. Among those aged 65\u201385 years, higher education and higher annual income tended to be\u00a0 associated with reduced psychological distress. Sensitivity analysis showed that living with other(s) was associated with less psychological distress at ages 40\u201364 and 65\u201385. Most of the cohabitants were spouses, suggesting that the presence of close relatives may also be\u00a0an important factor for psychological stability after age 40.\nMore than 40% of the 20\u201339 and 40\u201364-year-olds did not engage in leisure-time exercise. However, leisure-time exercise was associated with reduced psychological distress only among those aged 20\u201339 years.

The results may have been influenced by the fact that approximately 82% of the 65\u201385-year-olds engaged in some leisure-time exercise. Previous studies have suggested that a high level of overall PA, including daily living activities, is a predictor of good mental health among older adults (27). In this study, analyses were conducted using a common index to examine differences between generations. However, overall PA, including activities of daily living, should also be\u00a0 evaluated because leisure-time increases among older adults, making it difficult to categorize it with other activities. It is also possible that COVID-19 restrictions made people more likely to exercise at home, which requires higher income levels. A study of Japanese adults showed that leisure-time exercise was less common than were other physical activities (transport and work) in lower income/education populations (28). In other words, whether socioeconomic status affects psychological distress via leisure-time exercise needs to be\u00a0investigated in the future.\nMost previous studies have reported that higher household income is associated with less psychological distress (14, 15, 29, 30). In the present study, higher household income was associated with less psychological distress among those aged 20\u201339 and 65\u201385 years. During the period of this study (December 2020 to March 2021), Japan was in its second state of emergency declaration (January 8, 2021 to March 21, 2021). During the declared state of emergency,\nworkers were strongly suggested to refrain from leaving their homes and to work remotely, except when necessary. Many industries, including restaurants, fitness facilities, and leisure facilities, were closed and suffered significant losses. These factors likely affected the study participants whose psychological distress increased due to changes in income and working environment. On the other hand, a non-significant inverse association was found in the 40\u201364 years age group between full-time work and increased psychological distress, suggesting that the 40\u201364 years age group may have been affected by being in a more responsible position at work and working place infection control practices (leave-of-absence instructions, instructions for shortening business hours, and requests to avoid the working place in case of any symptoms) (31). In addition, high psychological distress among healthcare workers has been reported, and the impact of job type should also be\u00a0considered (22).\nRemote work is expected to become an established option for future work arrangements. However, prolonged remote work has been reported to decrease the sense of urgency to exercise, highlighting the need to build urban structures that facilitate exercise, create work systems that allow for more time to exercise (32), and promote alternatives such as digital training (33). As a future challenge, based on our results and accumulated evidence, creating an environment that facilitates exercise, especially for those who are socially vulnerable or have difficulty accessing leisure-time exercise, is crucial.\nTABLE\u00a02 Associations of leisure-time exercise and socioeconomic status with psychological distress.\nOverall 20\u201339 years 40\u201364 years 65\u201385 years\nIndependent variables\nOR 95%CI p-value OR 95%CI p-value OR 95%CI p-value OR 95%CI p-value\nAge 0.98 0.97\u20130.99 <0.001 1.02 0.97\u20131.06 0.493 0.97 0.95\u20130.99 0.004 1.03 0.96\u20131.11 0.423\nSex\nMale 1 1 1 1\nFemale 0.88 0.68\u20131.14 0.326 0.65 0.40\u20131.08 0.094 0.94 0.66\u20131.34 0.739 0.97 0.43\u20132.22 0.950\nLiving arrangement\nLiving alone 1 1 1 1\nLiving with other(s) 0.75 0.54\u20131.04 0.085 1.27 0.70\u20132.31 0.426 0.65 0.41\u20131.04 0.071 0.54 0.20\u20131.43 0.215\nLeisure-time exercise\nNot performed 1 1 1 1\nPerformed 0.75 0.60\u20130.95 0.019 0.45 0.28\u20130.73 0.001 0.82 0.61\u20131.11 0.197 1.44 0.58\u20133.61 0.432\nEducational attainment\nUp to junior college/\ntechnical school\n1 1 1 1\nCollege degree or\nhigher\n0.82 0.64\u20131.05 0.111 1.62 0.96\u20132.73 0.070 0.51 0.73\u20131.00 0.051 0.53 0.26\u20131.10 0.090\nEmployment type\nUnemployed 1 1 1 1\nPart-time 1.25 0.89\u20131.77 0.202 1.06 0.52\u20132.17 0.881 1.31 0.72\u20132.41 0.380 1.35 0.56\u20133.28 0.505\nFull-time 1.81 1.21\u20132.72 0.004 1.87 0.70\u20134.98 0.213 1.98 1.05\u20133.71 0.034 1.39 0.53\u20133.70 0.506\nAnnual household income\n<6 million yen 1 1 1 1\n\u22656 million yen 0.99 0.78\u20131.27 0.950 0.53 0.32\u20130.90 0.019 1.33 0.96\u20131.84 0.084 0.47 0.20\u20131.08 0.075\nOR, odds ratio; CI, confidence interval.

One limitation, however, is that recruitment was conducted in conjunction with a study to determine the rate of subclinical COVID-19 infection in the general population, which may have included participants with health concerns or fears and may have introduced a selection bias. Another limitation is that PA is a subjective assessment. In addition, because this was a cross-sectional study, causality could not be\u00a0established."

            "text": "We examined the association between psychological distress and leisure-time exercise/socioeconomic status among cohort study participants in an urban area in Japan by age group. Among young adults, leisure-time exercise and higher annual household income were associated with lower psychological distress, whereas in the 40\u201364 age group with greater social responsibility, employment type was associated with increased psychological distress. Among older adults, higher education and higher annual income were associated with less psychological distress. For those over 40 years of age, cohabitation was associated with reduced psychological distress. The findings suggest the need to consider mental health policies that take these factors into account for different generations. Further detailed studies are warranted to consider overall PA, job type, and work style."
