    "abstractText": "Heat stress can have an impact on parental gamete maturation and reproduction functions. According to current research, the microbial composition of the vaginal cavity is species specific. Pregnancy, menstruation, and genital diseases have been linked to the dynamics of vaginal ecology. In this study, we characterized the vaginal microbiota and metabolites after heat stress. At the phylum level, the rabbit\u2019s vaginal microbial composition of rabbit showed high similarity with that of humans. In the Heat group, the relative abundance of the dominant microbiota Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria increased, while the relative abundance of Firmicutes decreased. Furthermore, heat stress significantly increased the relative abundance of W5053, Helcococcus, Thiopseudomonas, ldiomaarina, atopostipes, and facklamia, whereas the relative abundance of 12 genera significantly decreased, including Streptococcus, UCG-005, Alistipes, [Eubacterium]_xylanophilum_group, Comamonas, RB41, Fastidiosipila, Intestinimonas, Arthrobacter, Lactobacillus, Leucobacter, and Family_xlll_AD3011_group. Besides, the relative concentrations of 158 metabolites differed significantly between the Heat and Control groups. Among them, the endocrine hormone estradiol (E2) increased in the Heat group and was positively associated with a number of metabolites such as linolelaidic acid (C18:2N6T), N-acetylsphingosine, N-oleoyl glycine, transpetroselinic acid, syringic acid, 2-(1-adamantyl)-1-morpholinoethan-1-one, 5-OxoETE, and 16-heptadecyne-1,2,4-triol. Further, the majority of the differential metabolites were enriched in steroid biosynthesis and endocrine and other factor-regulated calcium reabsorption pathways, reflecting that heat stress may affect calcium metabolism, hormone-induced signaling, and endocrine balance of vaginal ecology. These findings provide a comprehensive depiction of rabbit vaginal ecology and reveal the effects of heat stress on the vagina via the analysis of vaginal microbiome and metabolome, which may provide a new thought for low female fertility under heat stress.",

According to current research, the microbial composition of the vaginal cavity is species specific. Pregnancy, menstruation, and genital diseases have been linked to the dynamics of vaginal ecology. In this study, we characterized the vaginal microbiota and metabolites after heat stress. At the phylum level, the rabbit\u2019s vaginal microbial composition of rabbit showed high similarity with that of humans. In the Heat group, the relative abundance of the dominant microbiota Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria increased, while the relative abundance of Firmicutes decreased. Furthermore, heat stress significantly increased the relative abundance of W5053, Helcococcus, Thiopseudomonas, ldiomaarina, atopostipes, and facklamia, whereas the relative abundance of 12 genera significantly decreased, including Streptococcus, UCG-005, Alistipes, [Eubacterium]_xylanophilum_group, Comamonas, RB41, Fastidiosipila, Intestinimonas, Arthrobacter, Lactobacillus, Leucobacter, and Family_xlll_AD3011_group. Besides, the relative concentrations of 158 metabolites differed significantly between the Heat and Control groups. Among them, the endocrine hormone estradiol (E2) increased in the Heat group and was positively associated with a number of metabolites such as linolelaidic acid (C18:2N6T), N-acetylsphingosine, N-oleoyl glycine, transpetroselinic acid, syringic acid, 2-(1-adamantyl)-1-morpholinoethan-1-one, 5-OxoETE, and 16-heptadecyne-1,2,4-triol. Further, the majority of the differential metabolites were enriched in steroid biosynthesis and endocrine and other factor-regulated calcium reabsorption pathways, reflecting that heat stress may affect calcium metabolism, hormone-induced signaling, and endocrine balance of vaginal ecology. These findings provide a comprehensive depiction of rabbit vaginal ecology and reveal the effects of heat stress on the vagina via the analysis of vaginal microbiome and metabolome, which may provide a new thought for low female fertility under heat stress.\nKeywords: heat stress, vagina, microbiome, metabolome, rabbit\nINTRODUCTION\nHeat stress has been proved to be detrimental to the physiological and metabolic activities of animals (Bagath et al., 2019). Rabbits are known to be sensitive to high temperatures, which might be due to the shortage of sweat glands that effectively dissipate body heat (Oshima et al., 2011) and the presence of thick fur that prevents heat loss (Marai et al., 2001). When the ambient temperature\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 1 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 813622\nreaches 31\u25e6C or above, rabbits show a significant decrease in hemoglobin concentration, red blood cells, and packed cell volume. On the other hand, white blood cells, lymphocytes, creatinine, urea, and aspartate transaminase increase, implying that heat stress strengthens oxidative stress and impairs physiological functions (Mutwedu et al., 2021). Heat stress is also known to have a detrimental effect on the production performance of female rabbits. For example, compared to female rabbits living in appropriate temperatures, those suffering from heat stress produce fewer litters and fewer live-born kits (MarcoJim\u00e9nez et al., 2013). In bovine, a negative relationship has been observed between the conception rate and the rectal temperature (Ulberg and Burfening, 1967). The temperature of the genital tract including the vagina and cervix was elevated as the ambient temperature rose (Nabenishi et al., 2011; El-Sheikh Ali et al., 2020), indicating that heat stress could potentially cause a disturbance in the vaginal microenvironment.\nNowadays, considerable efforts have been made to assess the role of microorganisms and the metabolome of the reproductive tract in female health. In clinical cases, the shift in the vaginal microbiota from dominant Lactobacillus to a polymicrobial microbiota is usually diagnosed as bacterial vaginosis (BV) (Onderdonk et al., 2016). The microbial composition of the vagina is believed to be dynamic in a transitional period, such as pregnancy or menstruation (Hickey et al., 2013; Gupta et al., 2020). Previous studies have suggested that acute heat stress could cause intestinal metabolism disorders and microbiota changes in mice (Wen et al., 2021), pigs (Xiong et al., 2020), and poultry (Zhu et al., 2019). Long-term heat stress not only leads to a disorder of the estrous cycle but also alters the vaginal bacterial communities in rats (An et al., 2021).\nAlthough the vaginal microbiome might provide evidence for female clinical diagnosis, the effect of heat stress on the ecological community and associated metabolites in the vagina has not been elucidated. The objective of this study is to reveal the vaginal microenvironment of rabbits and to explore the effects of heat stress on the vaginal microbiota and metabolites, along with the mechanisms affecting the vaginal health of rabbits."

The rabbits were caged separately but raised together within each group and had free access to water and food. To synchronize the estrous cycle, all female rabbits used were injected intramuscularly with 70\u223c80 IU of pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin (PMSG, Ningbo Second Hormone Factory, Zhejiang, China).

In contrast, no\nextra treatment was provided to the Control group, considering that the climate in April in Southwest China is relatively cool, with an average temperature of 23\u25e6C.

After half a month of the heat-treated program, several sterile cotton swabs were inserted into the rabbits\u2019 vagina up to 3\u223c4 cm and rotated 1\u223c2 times to collect the vaginal content. The swabs from one individual were transferred to two sterile 15-ml centrifuge tubes (one sample was used for 16S DNA analysis and the other for the metabolome analysis) and stored at \u221280\u25e6C. On the same day, a blood sample of each rabbit was collected from the ear vein. A total of 16 individuals (8 from the Heat group and 8 from the Control group) were randomly selected from the experimental group for the following analysis."

The annotations for all metabolites were summarized (Supplementary Figure 1). The partial least square discrimination analysis (PLS-DA) indicated an obvious distinction between the Heat and Control groups (R2Y = 0.88, Q2 = 0.14, Figure 5A). The metabolites with VIP > 1 and p-value < 0.05 and fold change \u2265 2 or fold change \u2264 0.5 were considered to be differential metabolites (Figure 5B). The tendencies of variation of these metabolites are displayed in Figure 5C. Among these altered metabolites, there was a significant increase in the relative concentration of 109 metabolites in the Heat group, while 49 showed a notable decrease.

            "text": "With the rise in global warming, heat stress has been a severe challenge affecting the reproduction function of female animals and human beings. Previous studies have indicated that heat stress affects the quality of parental gametes, subsequently leading to a failure in fertilization and embryo development in vivo or\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 6 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 813622\nin vitro (Al-Katanani et al., 2002; Ozawa et al., 2002; Aroyo et al., 2007; Paul et al., 2008; Hendricks et al., 2009). Previous studies have also confirmed that heat stress can disrupt ovarian signaling (Dickson et al., 2018), impair estradiol synthesis of granulosa cells (Li H. et al., 2017), and affect ovarian hormone secretion (Sirotkin, 2010). Additionally, heat stress disturbs the ecological communities in the vagina (An et al., 2021), potentially impacting the normal function of the female reproductive tract (FRT). In this study, no significant changes were observed in plasma E2 and P4 in the Heat group. However, the plasma CAT, MDA, and T-AOC were significantly upregulated, indicating an extreme oxidative reaction in the Heat group. The unaffected plasma hormone balance may be due to the limited time of heatstress treatment, which was consistent with the research of heat exposure for gilts (Dickson et al., 2018).\nThe study first reveals the bacterial composition in the rabbit\u2019s vagina. Overall, 7 of the top 10 abundant vaginal microbiota at the phylum level were found to be common between rabbits and humans. Of them, the top 4 abundant microbiota in a rabbit\u2019s vagina were found to be Firmicutes, Actinobacteriota, Bacteroidota, and Proteobacteria, which are also the top 4\nabundant microorganisms in the human vagina. Cyanobacteria, Acidobacteriota, and Fusobacteria were found to be the other common microbiota. To compare, the top 4 abundant microbiota in a cow\u2019s vagina are Firmicutes, Bacteroidota, Proteobacteria, and Fusobacteria (Galv\u00e3o et al., 2019). Excluding the unidentified bacteria, Chloroflexi and Verrucomicrobia were the identified specific microbiota in rabbits\u2019 vaginas, Spirotomycetes and Planctomycetes in humans.\nThe dominated genera in rabbits\u2019 vaginas were quite different from those of humans or rats. The top 4 abundant genera in a rabbit\u2019s vagina were identified as Gemella, Corynebacteria, unidentified Chloroplast, and Porphyromonas, while Lactobacillus, Gardnerella, Prevotella (or Streptococcus), and Atopobium were the top 4 dominated genera identified in human vagina (Ceccarani et al., 2019; Fu et al., 2020). The 4 most dominated genera in a cow\u2019s vagina were Ureaplasma, Anaerobiospirillum, Clostridium, and Succinivibrio (Chen et al., 2020). These results indicate that the bacterial composition of rabbits, humans, and cows was similar at the phylum level. However, the vaginal microbiome was species specific at the genus level.\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 7 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 813622\nAfter the administration of heat stress to the Heat group, there were significant alterations in the microbiota of the rabbit vagina between the two groups. A study by Fu et al. (2020) revealed the differences in the vaginal microbiota and metabolomes between patients with RIF (RIF groups) and patients who achieved a successful clinical pregnancy in the first frozen embryo transfer cycle (normal group). Compared with the normal group, the relative abundance of Firmicutes significantly decreased in the RIF group, while the relative abundance of Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria increased. These changes were also observed in humans with genital infections including vulvovaginal candidiasis (VVC), Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), and BV. Surprisingly, in this study, the relative abundance of Firmicutes decreased in the Heat group\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 8 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 813622\nFIGURE 5 | Heat stress affected the vaginal metabolome of rabbit.

Corynebacterium, one of the dominant genera in rabbit vagina, increased its relative abundance in the Heat group, which is consistent with a previous study that demonstrated an increase in the abundance of Corynebacterium in rat vagina after heat-stress treatment (An et al., 2021). It has been suggested that Fusobacterium is one of the most abundant genera in cows (Santos et al., 2011; Jeon et al., 2015) and canines (Lyman et al., 2019). In the present study, Fusobacterium decreased four times in the Heat group. In general, the relative abundance of 18 genera was statistically different between the Heat and Control groups, of which 6 and 12 genera significantly increased and decreased (Locatelli et al., 2013), respectively. Among the increased genera, Helcococcus was highly prone to inflammation including human BV (Fall et al., 2018), metritis, and bacteremia (Chow and Clarridge, 2014). The diagnosis of BV may be associated with some adverse pregnancy outcomes (Nelson et al., 2007; Menard et al., 2010; Witkin, 2015). The genus W5053 in the semen sample of bulls has been reported to be natively correlated with fertility (Cojkic et al., 2021). On the other hand, heat stress decreased the abundance of 12 genera. Genus Streptococcus contains more than 100 species and was classified into groups ranging from A to W based on the antigenic reaction of the cell wall-associated carbohydrates (Lancefield and Freimer, 1966). Although a considerable group of species of Streptococcus is pathogenic, there is also a group of commensal and even beneficial species for animals or humans, such as Streptococcus thermophilus (Markakiou et al., 2020). Streptococcus was found to be one of the dominant genera in the vaginal samples of the giant panda, regardless of age and habitat (Yang et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2020).

Also, Streptococcus was found in rabbit feces, beneficial for digesting xylose (Bor\u00f8 et al., 2010). However, the abundance of Streptococcus has been found to increase in vagina samples of humans with genital infections (Ceccarani et al., 2019).\nSimilar to the sample from humans with genital infections (Ceccarani et al., 2019), HPV (Ilhan et al., 2019), or reproduction disorders (Fu et al., 2020), a decline in the abundance of Lactobacillus was observed in the Heat group, suspected to be susceptible to pathogenic infections. Firstly, Lactobacillus in the\nvagina can produce bacteriostatic compounds (Borges et al., 2014; Aldunate et al., 2015) against the harmful bacterium. On the other hand, their metabolite, lactic acid, can establish an acidic environment (pH ranges from 2.8 to 4.2) in the vagina (Borges et al., 2014) and attenuate pro-inflammatory responses through the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (Hearps et al., 2017). Pretreating spermatozoa with three Lactobacilli decreased the level of lipid peroxidation generated by ferrous (Barbonetti et al., 2011), even though a neutral PH environment is required for the survival of spermatozoa. However, previous studies indicate that the dominance of Lactobacillus in the vagina is unique to humans. Although the pH in rabbits\u2019 vaginal microenvironment is 7.2 \u00b1 0.4 (Jacques et al., 1986), considering the ability of PH regulation and bacteriostasis of Lactobacillus, the decrease of Lactobacillus can disturb the homeostasis and increase the susceptibility to pathogenic infections in the rabbit vagina. The results of the functional analysis of the taxa for both the Heat and Control groups showed that heat stress impacted the material-and-energy-related pathways, which includes amino acid-related enzymes, glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, and starch and sucrose metabolism.\nRecent studies have highlighted the connections between microbiota and metabolites in some disorders and diseases (Liu et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019; Borgogna et al., 2020). A comprehensive analysis of the alterations of both microbiota and metabolites is beneficial for biomarker selection in some reproductive disorders. For example, Vitali et al. (2015) developed a molecular approach for BV diagnosis based on the joint analysis of the vaginal microbiome and metabolome. Multiomics analysis of immunome, metabolome, microbiome, transcriptome, and proteome of full-term pregnancy depicted comprehensive knowledge of multifaced adaptations in pregnant females, which laid a foundation for prospective diagnosis of pregnancy-related pathologies (Ghaemi et al., 2019).\nThe present study showed that the composition of metabolites was significantly different between the Heat and Control groups, where up to 158 metabolites increased or decreased in the rabbit vagina after heat stress exposure (p < 0.05). Among the top 20 differential metabolites between the two groups, the concentration of estradiol (E2) increased in the Heat group, and it was positively associated with linolelaidic acid (C18:2N6T), N-acetylsphingosine, N-oleoyl glycine, trans-petroselinic acid, syringic acid, and 2-(1-adamantyl)-1-morpholinoethan-1-one. Previous studies have highlighted the positive role of estrogen receptor \u03b1 (ESR1) in the epithelial cells of the upper FRT, supporting fertilization or embryo development (Winuthayanon et al., 2015; Li S. et al., 2017). Both ESR1 and its ligand estrogen help build a barrier against pathogenic invasion by maintaining the epithelial thickness (Miyagawa and Iguchi, 2015) and promoting the secretion of antimicrobial peptides, cytokines, and chemokines (Salamonsen et al., 2007; Ochiel et al., 2008). Vaginal administration of estradiol has been used for the treatment of menopausal symptoms in humans. However, whether its metabolism in the human vagina is the same as in a rabbit\u2019s vagina is unknown. Besides, no significant changes were observed in the plasma E2 of rabbits, implying that the hormone metabolism in the vaginal\nFrontiers in Microbiology | www.frontiersin.org 10 April 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 813622\nmicroenvironment was relatively independent of the systemic estradiol regulation. On the other hand, the associated syringic acid was found to suppress the inflammatory reaction while promoting the antioxidative biomarker expression in the mouse model of asthma (Li et al., 2019). Furthermore, syringic acid-treated human hepatoma HepG2 cells exhibited obvious morphological changes and had a higher level of reactive oxygen species and cytotoxicity. This indicates that heat stress aggravates the oxidative reaction response in the vaginal microenvironment.\nConjugated linoleic acid (CLA) is the intermediate product of polyunsaturated fatty acids (Bauman and Griinari, 2003). Linoleic acid has been suspected to promote the in vitro apoptosis and necrosis of lymphocytes by acting on mitochondrial depolarization and oxygen radical production (Cury-Boaventura et al., 2006). Linolelaidic acid (C18:2N6T) is one member of the CLAs that has been proved to play roles in body fat deposition (Park et al., 1997; Gaullier et al., 2004; Halade et al., 2010), tumor process (Wong et al., 1997; Ip et al., 2003; Shiraishi et al., 2010), and insulin resistance (Ris\u00e9rus et al., 2002, 2004). CLA displays an estrogen antagonistic effect through inhibiting ER-mediated signaling in ER-positive cancer cells (Kim et al., 2015). In vitro treatment with CLA inhibited Bcl-2 expression induced by estrogen in cancerous cells and promoted apoptosis (Wang et al., 2008). In this study, linolelaidic acid (C18:2N6T) was positively associated with estradiol, implying a potential balance between estrogenic and anti-estrogenic effects in vaginal ecology.\nSubsequently, the study showed that differential metabolites are significantly enriched by steroid biosynthesis and endocrine and other factor-regulated calcium reabsorption pathways. The effect of heat stress on female production includes the disorder of the estrous cycle, which is often accompanied by the change in hormone levels, including E2 and P4 (Viau and Meaney, 1991). Moreover, heat stress can suppress the FSHR expression and estradiol synthesis of granulosa cells (Li H. et al., 2017). In this study, heat stress increased the level of E2 in the rabbit vagina, indicating an abnormal gonadal hormone-induced signaling. Dietary calcium and vitamin D insufficiency has been reported to be associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (Thys-Jacobs et al., 1999) and premenstrual syndrome (Purdue-Smithe et al., 2017). However, their metabolism in vaginal ecology is unknown. Many studies have demonstrated that heat stress can directly and indirectly affect the endocrine system and reproductive outcome (Luo et al., 2016; Li H. et al., 2017; Dickson et al., 2018). This implied heat stress affected the calcium metabolism and hormone regulation of vaginal ecology, which may impact the health and reproductive performance."

Among them, estradiol, syringic acid, and linolelaidic acid (C18:2N6T) increased in the Heat group, whereas syringic acid and linolelaidic acid (C18:2N6T) are suspected to have anti-estrogenic effects in the vaginal ecology. The KEGG analysis of differential metabolites implies that heat stress affects the hormone-induced signaling and endocrine balance of vaginal ecology.
