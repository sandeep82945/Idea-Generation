1. **Investigate the relationship between review informativeness and review helpfulness.** The paper defines review informativeness in terms of exhaustiveness and strength, but it does not explore the relationship between these factors and review helpfulness. Future research could investigate this relationship to determine whether more informative reviews are also more helpful to authors.


2. **Develop a system to automatically generate informative peer reviews.** The paper proposes a system to automatically grade peer reviews for their informativeness, but it does not explore the possibility of automatically generating informative reviews. Future research could investigate this possibility, which could help to address the problem of reviewer shortage.


3. **Explore the use of AI to improve the peer review process.** The paper discusses the use of AI to support the peer review process, but it does not explore the full range of possibilities. Future research could investigate the use of AI to automate other aspects of the peer review process, such as reviewer assignment and decision-making.


4. **Investigate the impact of review informativeness on the quality of research.** The paper does not explore the impact of review informativeness on the quality of research. Future research could investigate this relationship to determine whether more informative reviews lead to higher-quality research.


5. **Develop a system to detect and penalize low-quality peer reviews.** The paper proposes a system to automatically grade peer reviews for their informativeness, but it does not explore the possibility of using this system to detect and penalize low-quality reviews. Future research could investigate this possibility, which could help to improve the quality of the peer review process.
