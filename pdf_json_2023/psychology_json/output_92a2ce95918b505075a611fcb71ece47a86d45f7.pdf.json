    "abstractText": "New sets of ibuprofen and indomethacin conjugates comprising triazolyl heterocycle were synthesized via click chemistry, adopting an optimized protocol through the molecular hybridization approach affording the targeted agents in good yields. The new non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) conjugates were designed and synthesized and could be considered as potential drug candidates for the treatment of pain and inflammation. The anti-inflammatory properties were investigated for all the synthesized conjugates. Among 14 synthesized conjugates, four (5a, 5b, 5d, and 5e) were found to have significant anti-inflammatory properties potency 117.6%, 116.5%, 93.8%, and 109.1% in comparison to reference drugs ibuprofen (97.2%) and indomethacin (100%) in the rat paw edema carrageenan test without any ulcerogenic liability. The suppression effect of cytokines IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and iNOS in addition to NO in the LPS-induced RAW264.7 cells supports the promising anti-inflammatory properties observed in the ibuprofen conjugates. In addition, several conjugates showed promising peripheral and central analgesic activity. The selectivity index (SI) of compound 5a (23.096) indicates the significant efficacy and selectivity for COX-2 over COX-1. Molecular modeling (docking and QSAR) studies described the observed biological properties.",

COX is known as a rate-limiting enzyme because it serves as the major pathway or key for the formation of these prostanoids. However, COX also plays a vital role in normal cellular processes. Three isoforms (COX-1, COX-2, and COX-3) of COX have been identified [2,3]. Both COX-1 and COX-2 are responsible for important physiological processes and are involved in the pathological process of cancer, pain and inflammation. COX-1 is essential for the prostaglandin-mediated functions of the gastrointestinal and cardiovascular systems. Under normal conditions, COX-2 is present at a low level. However, COX-2 is expressed in the response to pro-inflammatory and pathogenic stimuli.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1945. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28041945 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1945 2 of 24\nIn addition, COX-2 plays a critical role, not only in inflammation [1,4] but also in various pathologies that include cancer [5,6], neurodegenerative diseases [7], and multidrug resistance [8]. Since 1897, NSAIDs are in practice as the first-line drugs for pain and inflammation. The non-selective inhibition nature of traditional NSAIDs (Figure 1) against the cyclooxygenase isoenzymes (COX-1 and COX-2), restricts their uses because of many associated disadvantages like gastrointestinal and ulcerogenic side effects [9].\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 24\nvital role in normal cellular processes.

Biological Studies 2.2.1. Anti-Inflammatory Properties\nThe well-established carrageenan-induced rat paw edema technique was adopted to determine the anti-inflammatory property of the synthesized conjugates [14\u201316]. Enhanced anti-inflammatory properties were revealed by some of the prepared conjugates with better potency than their precursors. However, no anti-inflammatory efficacy was observed for compounds 7, 8b, and 8f. SAR (structure\u2013activity relationship) through the observed anti-inflammatory data (Table 1, Figure 3) optimizes a few items controlling the biological properties. Generally, conjugation of triazolyl heterocycle with ibuprofen scaffold affords better anti-inflammatory active agents than that of indomethacin (compound 5c is an exception). Some conjugates with enhanced anti-inflammatory properties were observed relative to their parent drug [compounds 5a, 5b, and 5e show % potency = 117.6, 116.5, 109.1, respectively, compared with % potency of ibuprofen (parent precursor) = 97.2].\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1945 4 of 24Molecules 20 3, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 4 of 24\nCs2CO3, THF 0 \u00b0C to rt , overnight\nSod-D-isoascorbate CuSO4.5H2O n-BuOH/H2O (2:1) MW, 70 \u00b0C, 2 h\nN3\nR\n1\n3, 99%\n4a g\n5a g, 79-92%\n5a: R = 2-Cl 5b: R = 4-Cl 5c: R = 4-F 5d: R = 4-CH3 5e: R = 2-OCH3 5f: R = 4-OCH3 5g: R = 4-NO2 O O N NN R\nOH\nO\nO\nO\nK2CO3, DMF rt , overnight\n6\n7, 97%\nSod-D-isoascorbate CuSO4.5H2O t-BuOH/H2O (2:1) MW, 70 \u00b0C, 2 h N3 R\n4a g\n8a-g, 63-87%\nO\nO\nN NN R\nN\nOCl\nO\nOH\nON\nOCl\nO\nO\nON\nOCl\nO\nBr\n2\n8a: R = 2-Cl 8b: R = 4-Cl 8c: R = 4-F 8d: R = 4-CH3 8e: R = 2-OCH3 8f: R = 4-OCH3 8g: R = 4-NO2\nScheme 1.

Statistical analysis was conducted by one-way ANOVA (* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.001).\nFor the ibuprofen\u2013triazole conjugates, the chloro-substituted phenyl triazoles are of higher anti-inflammatory properties than those of methyl/methoxy substituted phenyls, as shown in compounds 5a/5b/5d/5e/5f. Additionally, the ortho-substituted phenyl analogs are of better anti-inflammatory properties than the para-substituted conjugates as shown in pairs 5a/5b and 5e/5f. The last correlation was also noticed for indomethacin-triazole conjugates as exhibited in pairs 8a/8b and 8e/8f.

Ibuprofen\u2013triazole conjugates containing halogenated phenyl, are more effective agents than those with methylor methoxyphenyl analogs as in compounds 5b/5c/5d/5f and 5a/5e. Conjugate with chlorophenyl substituent is more potent than that of fluorophenyl ring as exhibited in pairs 5b/5c (% potency = 121.9, 116.0, respectively). Additionally, the p-substituted phenyl conjugates are of higher analgesic properties than those of ortho-substituted phenyl analogs\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1945 7 of 24\nas shown in pairs 5a/5b (% potency = 116.0, 121.9, respectively) and 5e/5f (% potency = 88.2, 111.4, respectively). Contrary, the ortho-substituted phenyl indomethacin\u2013triazole conjugates show higher peripheral analgesic properties than those of the p-substituted phenyl conjugates as shown in pairs 8a/8b and 8e/8f (% potency = 68.7, 64.5 and 112.5, 93.0, respectively). Additionally, the methyl- and methoxyphenyl-containing indomethacin\u2013triazole analogs are of better efficacies than the halogenated phenyl-containing conjugates as viewed in compounds 8d/8f/8c/8b and 8e/8a.\nCentral Analgesic\nCentral analgesic properties of the synthesized agents were undertaken by the hot plate assay in mice (10 mg/kg \u201canimal body weight\u201d indomethacin mol equivalent) [14,15]. It is noted that from the obtained results (Table 3), compound 8f is the most effective agent synthesized with higher potency than its precursor (potency = 117.7, 100 for 8f and indomethacin, respectively). Compound 5a also reveals central analgesic potency comparable to its parent drug (potency = 96.5, 96.1 for 5a and ibuprofen, respectively). It has also been noticed that, although compound 5c reveals high analgesic properties at the first-time interval (1.8 folds % protection relative to its parent drug \u201cibuprofen at 30 min.\u201d), the bio-properties drastically reduced by time (% protection = 18.0, 54.3 for 5c and ibuprofen, respectively, at 120 min.). A similar observation was shown by conjugate 5f (% protection = 90.1, 0.2; 61.7, 54.3 for 5f and ibuprofen, respectively, at 30, 120 min. time intervals). Meanwhile, compound 8f (the most potent agent synthesized) exhibits almost stable bio-observations throughout all the experimental time intervals in a similar profile to its parent drug (% protection = 66.3, 92.4, 68.4, 66.5; 87.1, 80.9, 57.9, 56.5 for 8f and indomethacin at 30, 60, 90, 120 min., respectively).\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1945 8 of 24\na Potency is that at 120 min. compared to indomethacin. * p < 0.05, ** p < 0.001.\nSAR can be identified due to biological observations. For the ibuprofen\u2013triazole conjugates, the halogenated phenyl-containing conjugates show higher central analgesic properties relative to the methyl- or methoxyphenyl containing compounds as shown in compounds 5b/5c/5d/5f and 5a/5e. The ortho-substituted phenyl containing triazoles show more potent biological properties than the para-substituted phenyl analogs as exhibited in pairs 5a/5b (potency = 96.5, 48.0, respectively) and 5e/5f (potency = 49.6, 0.4, respectively). Contrary, the methyl-, methoxyphenyl containing indomethacin\u2013triazole conjugates show higher bio-properties than the fluoro-, chlorophenyl-containing conjugates \u201c8a is an exception\u201d [as shown in compounds 8d/8f compared with 8b/8c (potency = 86.0, 117.7, 17.2, 85.1, respectively)].\n2.2.3. Ulcerogenic Liability\nThe most promising anti-inflammatory active agents (3, 5a, 5b, 5d, 5e) were tested for ulcerogenic liability in mice [14,15]. Table 4 shows that none of the synthesized potential conjugates (5a, 5b, 5d, 5e) show ulcers or erosions to the tested animal gastric which indicates their safe applicability for oral administration.\n2.2.4. Toxicological Bioassay\nThe most promising anti-inflammatory agents (3, 5a, 5b, 5d, and 5e) were tested for their toxicological effect in mice [14,15]. Five times the anti-inflammatory dose was orally administrated. No toxic symptoms or mortality were revealed by any of the tested compounds.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1945 9 of 24\n2.2.5. Inhibitory Properties of COX-1 and COX-2\nThe inhibitory properties of the promising anti-inflammatory active agents (3, 5a, 5b, 5d, and 5e) against COX-1 and COX-2 were undertaken by the standard techniques obeying the manufacturer\u2019s instructions [29]. It is noticed from the results observed (Table 5), that all the synthesized agents are with enhanced selectivity index [SI = IC50 (COX-1)/IC50 (COX-2)] towards COX-2 relative to COX-1. Conjugate 5a is superior with a high SI = 23.096. Conjugate 5b also has a promising SI value (SI = 9.619). It has also been noticed that the SI values are consistent with the anti-inflammatory % potency of most of the tested conjugates (SI = 2.262, 23.096, 9.619, 2.158 corresponding to % potency = 105.8, 117.6, 116.5, 93.8 for conjugates 3, 5a, 5b and 5d). Meanwhile, conjugate 5e is with higher potency against COX-1 relative to its precursor supporting the anti-inflammatory properties observed (IC50 against COX-1 = 5.417, 13.16 \u00b5M corresponding to % potency = 109.1, 97.2, for 5e and Ibu, respectively). Moreover, it is with a mild SI value (COX-1/COX-2) in similar behavior to its precursor (SI = 0.387, 0.106 for 5e and Ibu, respectively).\n* p < 0.05, ** p < 0.001.\n2.2.6. Evaluation of NO Production of LPS-Induced RAW264.7\nThe anti-inflammatory responses of ibuprofen conjugates (5a, 5b, 5d, 5e) and indomethacin (reference standard) were assessed on LPS- stimulated RAW264.7 cells. The nitrite production in the supernatant in the culture medium was measured using Greiss reaction [30]. Based on the nitrite standard curve, it was found that the baseline of NO production in RAW 264.7 cells is 12.8 \u00b5M. More importantly, when RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated with LPS, NO production was significantly increased to 22 \u00b5M compared to the control (*** p < 0.001). Indomethacin (positive control) significantly decreased LPSstimulated NO production to 18.8 \u00b1 2.2 \u00b5M (* p < 0.05). However, the ibuprofen conjugates, 5a, 5b, and 5d, significantly reduced the LPS-stimulated NO production to 17.7 \u00b5M \u00b1 3.5, 4.88 \u00b1 1 \u00b5M, and 1.45 \u00b1 1.3 \u00b5M, respectively, compared to LPS-stimulated cells (*** p < 0.001, *** p < 0.001, *** p < 0.001, respectively). These results demonstrate that these ibuprofen conjugates 5a, 5b, and 5d are superior to the positive control (indomethacin) in reducing NO production in LPS-stimulated RAW264.7 cells and highlighting the potential anti-inflammatory effect. Lastly, the ibuprofen conjugate 5e showed an insignificant decrease (p > 0.05) in NO production in comparison to LPS-stimulated cells (Figure 4).\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1945 10 of 24Molecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 24\nBased on the previous results showing that the ibuprofen conjugates 5a, 5b, 5d, and 5e were able to decrease NO production in LPS-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells, we sought to determine the effect of these conjugates on the pro-inflammatory mRNA markers (IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and iNOS). For this purpose, the mRNA levels of IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and iNOS were measured using real-time qPCR (RT-qPCR).

Compound 5e is more potent in inhibiting COX-1 and is about three folds less active in inhibiting COX-2. To understand the underlying molecular basis of interaction leading to the selectivity of compounds, we carried out docking studies using the Glide program of the Schrodinger software, v2020-1 [31].

Glide poses were first validated by docking the native ligands of the 6COX and 3N8W structure in the receptor active site.

The binding mode of compound 5e in the COX-1 active site (PDB 3N8W) reveals that the triazole ring lies perpendicular to the plane of the 2-OCH3 phenyl ring (Figure 6). In this orientation, the triazole ring makes a critical H-bonding interaction with Arg120, which is located at the entrance of the cyclooxygenase active site. Arachidonic acid (AA), the cyclooxygenase substrate, makes a salt bridge interaction with Arg120 of COX-1 with its carboxylic group [35]. Indeed, many non-selective NSAIDs, including the aryl acetic acid class of compounds, possess a carboxylic acid to mimic the interaction of AA with Arg120 [36]. The 2-methoxy substituent on the phenyl ring in 5e fits into a hydrophobic groove near the enzyme active site. This 2-methoxy substituent may impart COX-1 inhibitory activity by interacting with residues Leu531 and Val349.

The triazole ring got flipped and is essentially coplanar with the 2-chloro phenyl ring. The chloro substituent makes vdW contact with Ile523. The drop of COX-1 potency in 5a could be attributed to the loss of key interactions with Leu531 or Val 349. H-bonding interactions with Arg120 were also not observed, although a cation-pi interaction between Arg120 and the triazole ring could occur. The experimental data for 5a and 5e also agree with the observed Glide XP scores of \u22125.9 kcal/mol and \u22125.5 kcal/mol, respectively. Since docking scores are not a reliable indicator of binding free energies, we carried out MM\u2012GBSA binding free energy (\u0394Gbind) calculations [38] on the docked poses of 5a and 5e. We observed a more significant difference in the binding free energy estimations (\u221287 kcal/mol for 5e and \u221268 kcal/mol for 5a), which correlated well with the observed COX-1 IC50s.

COX-2 has a larger side pocket formed by substituting His513 (in COX-1) with Arg 513 and mutation of Ile434 and 523 (in COX-1) to smaller valine residues [39]. In the COX-2 structure, the Leu531 is more flexible, oriented differently, and may not be critical for substrate binding or COX activity. In contrast, Leu531 mutations in COX-1 may lead to more than 90% loss of maximal cyclooxygenase activity [35]. To understand the greater COX-2 potency of 5a and the relative loss of activity of 5e, we docked these two compounds in the COX-2 crystal structure (PDB ID: 6COX). Interestingly, the Glide XP could dock only 5a (Figure 8) but did not give any pose for compound 5e. The docking simulations were carried out using default conditions, including Coulomb\u2013van der Waals energy cut-off of 0 kcal/mol for pose filtering. To accept higher energy poses of 5e, we relaxed the threshold to incorporate poses with the combined Coulomb and van der Waals interaction energy of 2 kcal/mol. However, the Glide XP again could not retrieve any pose for the compound, suggesting that 5e may not optimally fit into the COX-2 active site. Switching the Glide XP mode to a less accurate Glide standard precision (SP) mode did dock 5e; however, the SP pose was not considered for analysis. The MM-GBSA \u0394Gbind calculations on the XP pose of compound 5a gave a binding free energy of \u221269 kcal/mol, which was marginally better than the binding free energy of 5a (68 kcal/mol) in the COX-1 active site. The triazole ring of 5a in the COX-2 structure is oriented out of the plane (Figure 8) and interacts with Arg120 via cation-pi interactions. The presence of the 2-chloro substituent resulted in COX-2 selectivity, probably by interacting with Pro86 and Val89 through hydrophobic and vdW interactions. Val89 is a residue of the membrane binding domain of COX and is shown to confer greater COX-2 inhibitory potency [40]. We then docked compounds 5b and 5d in the 6COX active site. In agreement with the SAR we observed better docking (XP) and MMGBSA scores (\u22122.681, \u221259.66 kcal/mol) for 5d over 5b (1.145, \u221239.94 kcal/mol). MMGBSA binding free energy of 5a, 5b, and 5d also aligned with the observed COX-2 experimental data (Table 5).\nFor COX-2, the substrate AA does not make a salt bridge with Arg120 but makes an H-bonding interaction with Tyr385 and Ser530.

In agreement with the SAR we observed better docking (XP) and MMGBSA scores (\u22122.681, \u221259.66 kcal/mol) for 5d over 5b (1.145, \u221239.94 kcal/mol). MMGBSA binding free energy of 5a, 5b, and 5d also aligned with the observed COX-2 experimental data (Table 5).\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1945 14 of 24Molecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 14 of 24\nFigure 8.

D-QSAR Studies\nQSAR can utilize the physicochemical parameters (descriptors) to express mathematically the biological properties. It is usable to rationalize the bio-properties exhibited. Prediction of new hits/leads based on a pre-assigned model and identification of parameters essential for bio-properties optimization are benefits of the QSAR technique [41,42].\n2.3.3. Anti-Inflammatory QSAR Model\nCODESSA-Pro software was considered for the current QSAR studies [15]. A robust three-descriptor QSAR model (R2 = 0.979, R2cvOO = 0.951, R2cvMO = 0.963) describes the anti-inflammatory observations of the tested compounds (Supplementary Materials Tables S2\u2013S4, Figure S2). The charge-related-descriptor H-donors PSA (t = \u22125.545) negatively participated in the QSAR model with a coefficient value \u22120.0149. Therefore, a compound with a high mathematical descriptor value estimates low biological property, as exhibited in pairs 5c and 5e (descriptor value = 11.928, 1.909, corresponding to estimated anti-inflammatory property = 26.3, 89.7, respectively). The partial positively charged surface area is determined by Equation (1) [43]. PPSA1 \u2211A SA A \u2208 {\u03b4A > 0} (1) where, SA is the positively charged solvent-accessible atomic surface area. Weighted PNSA is also a charge-related descriptor (t = \u221213.16). The low descriptor value of 5d relative to that of 5c explains its potent estimated anti-inflammatory property (descriptor value = 121.181, 148.1222, corresponding to estimated property = 84.8, 26.3, respectively) due to its negative coefficient sign (coefficient = \u22120.002) in the QSAR model. The surface-weighted charged partial negative charged surface area WNSA-1 is determined by Equation (2) [43].\nWNSA\u2212 1 = PNSA1.TMSA 1000\n(2)\nPNSA1 stands for the partial negatively charged molecular surface area, while TMSA stands for the total molecular surface area. Relative negative-charged surface area is also a charge-related descriptor with a coefficient value \u22120.060. This explains the enhanced predicted anti-inflammatory property of 5b relative to 5c (descriptor value = 0.1223, 9.46504, corresponding to estimated property = 85.5, 26.3, respectively). The relative negative charge can be determined by Equation (3) [43].\nRNCG = \u03b4\u2212max\n\u2211A \u03b4A A \u2208 {\u03b4A > 0} (3)\nwhere, \u03b4\u2212max stands for the maximum atomic negative charge in the molecule, while \u03b4A stands for the negative atomic charge in the molecule. The statistical parameters (F = 123.9, s2 = 0.001) and the correlation of the observed and predicted anti-inflammatory properties of the tested compounds preserving their potencies among each other support the goodness of the QSAR model.\n2.3.4. Peripheral Analgesic QSAR Model\nStatistically robust validated three-descriptor QSAR model expressed the observed analgesic properties (peripheral) of the synthesized analogs (Supplementary Materials Tables S5\u2013S7, Figure S3). The semi-empirical descriptor average nucleophilic reactivity index for atom N possesses a coefficient value \u22120.981123 in the QSAR model determining 1/(property \u201c% inhibition/protection\u201d). The high descriptor value determines low potent analog as shown in compounds 5c and 8c (descriptor values = 0.00721, 0.00365 corresponding to the estimated % protection/inhibition = 86.0 and 42.5, respectively). Fukui atomic nucleophilic reactivity index can be calculated by Equation (4) [43].\nNA = \u2211i\u2208A C2iHOMO/(1\u2212 \u03b5HOMO) (4)\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1945 16 of 24\nwhere \u03b5HOMO and CiHOMO stand for the highest occupied molecular energy and coefficients, respectively. Maximum atomic state energy for atom H is also a semi-empirical descriptor with a negative coefficient sign in the attained QSAR model. This explains the low estimated analgesic properties of compound 8c relative to 8e (descriptor values = 7.7989, 7.8328 corresponding to the estimated % protection/inhibition = 42.5 and 87.5, respectively). The electron\u2013electron repulsion and attraction energies for a given atomic species can be determined by Equations (5) and (6), respectively [43].\nEee(A) = \u2211B 6=A \u2211\u00b5,\u03bd\u2208A \u2211\u03bb,\u03c3\u2208B P\u00b5\u03bdP\u03bb\u03c3\u3008\u00b5\u03bd|\u03bb\u03c3\u3009 (5)\nEne(AB) = \u2211B \u2211\u00b5,\u03bd\u2208A P\u00b5\u03bd \u2329 \u00b5 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 ZBRiB \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u03bd\u232a (6)\nwhere A and B are two different atoms, P\u00b5\u03bd, P\u03bb\u03c3 are the density matrix elements over atomic basis {\u00b5\u03bd\u03bb\u03c3}, and \u3008\u00b5\u03bd|\u03bb\u03c3\u3009 is the electron repulsion integral on atomic basis {\u00b5\u03bd\u03bb\u03c3}. P\u00b5\u03bd is the density matrix elements over atomic basis {\u00b5\u03bd}. ZB is the charge of atomic nucleus B. RiB is the distance between the electron and atomic nucleus B. \u2329 \u00b5 \u2223\u2223\u2223 ZBRiB \u2223\u2223\u2223\u03bd\u232a is the electron\u2013 nucleus attraction integral on atomic basis {\u00b5\u03bd}. Again, the maximum electrophilic reactivity index for atom C is a semi-empirical descriptor with a negative coefficient value (\u22121.28007) in the 2D-QSAR model attained. This is why compound 5c reveals potent estimated biological observation relative to 8a (descriptor values = 0.02583, 0.02041 corresponding to the estimated % protection/inhibition = 86.0 and 47.4, respectively). Fukui\u2019s atomic electrophilic reactivity index is determined by Equation (7) [43]. EA = \u2211j\u2208A C2jLUMO/(\u03b5LUMO + 10) (7) where \u03b5LUMO and CjLUMO are the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital energy and coefficients, respectively. The comparative values of observed and predicted analgesic properties support the goodness of QSAR model attained (Supplementary Materials Table S6).\n2.3.5. Central Analgesic QSAR Model\nCODESSA-Pro was utilized for optimizing the statistically robust three-descriptor QSAR model (R2 = 0.967, R2cvOO = 0.941, R2cvMO = 0.949) utilizing the homogeneous (non-diverse) bio-active conjugates revealing variable biological properties (observed % protection = 0.2\u201366.5) (Supplementary Materials Tables S8\u2013S10, Figure S4). Maximum resonance energy for bond H\u2013C is a semi-empirical descriptor positively participated in the QSAR model determining directly the % protection (property) of the tested agents with high coefficient value (coefficient = 402.343). The high descriptor value optimizes potent analgesic agents as shown in analogs 8f and 5d (descriptor value = 11.44, 11.3564 corresponding to predicted property = 68.4, \u22122.1, respectively). Resonance energy between two atoms can be calculated by Equation (8) [43].\nER AB \u2211\u00b5\u2208A \u2211\u03bd\u2208B P\u00b5\u03bd\u03b2\u00b5\u03bd (8)\nwhere A and B stand for two different atomic species. P\u00b5\u03bd and \u03b2\u00b5\u03bd stand for the density matrix elements and resonance integrals, respectively, over the atomic basis {\u00b5\u03bd}. Fractional PNSA is a charge-related descriptor that also positively participated in the QSAR model with a high coefficient value (coefficient = 615.863). This explains the high estimated property of conjugate 8f over 5g (descriptor value = \u22120.0549, \u22120.08934 corresponding to predicted property = 68.4, 25.2, respectively). The fractional atomic charge for the weighted surface area (partially positive) can be calculated by Equation (9) [43].\nFPSA3 = PPSA3 TMSA\n(9)\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1945 17 of 24\nSince PPSA3 and TMSA stand for the total charge (partially positive) weighted molecular surface area and the total molecular surface area, respectively. The maximum 1-electron reactivity index for atom N is a semi-empirical descriptor that negatively participated in the QSAR model with the highest coefficient value among all the other descriptors (coefficient = \u22128834.15). So, the analog with a high descriptor value leads directly to low biologically active agents as revealed in compounds 5d and 8f (descriptor value = 0.00536, 0 with predicted property = \u22122.1, 68.4, respectively). Fukui atomic one-electron reactivity index can be calculated by Equation (10) [43].\nRA = \u2211i\u2208A \u2211j\u2208A CiHOMOCjLUMO/(\u03b5LUMO \u2212 \u03b5HOMO) (10)\nwhere CiHOMO and CjLUMO stand for the highest occupied and the lowest unoccupied molecular oribital coefficients. The predicted biological properties based on the QSAR model attained are comparable to the observed central analgesic properties (Supplementary Materials Table S9)."

            "text": "In summary, novel sets of ibuprofen and indomethacin-containing compounds (5 and 8) were designed and synthesized using a molecular hybridization approach. Compounds 5a, 5b, 5d, and 5e exhibited promising anti-inflammatory properties relative to their parent drugs ibuprofen and indomethacin. No ulcerogenic liability was shown by all the potent conjugates (5a, 5b, 5d, and 5e) synthesized supporting their enhanced properties. Considerable selectivity towards COX-2 was noticed by the most promising anti-inflammatory agents synthesized through in vitro COX-1/COX-2 inhibitory testing compared to parent drugs, ibuprofen, and indomethacin. The suppression effect of LPS-induced production of NO, and cytokines IL-6, TNF-\u03b1, and iNOS in RAW264.7 cells support the promising anti-inflammatory properties observed in the ibuprofen conjugates. Molecular modeling explained the observed biological properties.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/molecules28041945/s1, Figure S1: (a) Overlay of the bioactive conformation of Flurbiprofen (green) with the Glide XP docked pose of the ligand in COX-1 crystal structure, PDB entry 3N8W; (b) Overlay of the bioactive conformation of SC-558 (green) with the Glide XP docked pose of the ligand in COX-2 crystal structure, PDB entry 6COX; Figure S2: QSAR plot representing the observed versus predicted log[% inhibition of edema thickness for the tested compounds at 10 mg/kg (rat body weight) indomethacin mol equivalent at 3 h effect]; Figure S3: QSAR plot representing the observed versus predicted 1/property \u201c% inhibition of peripheral analgesic properties for the tested compounds at 10 mg/kg (rat body weight) indomethacin mol equivalent\u201d; Figure S4: QSAR plot representing the observed versus predicted property \u201c% protection for the central analgesic tested compounds at 10 mg/kg (rat body weight) indomethacin mol equivalent\u201d; Table S1: mRNA sequences used for RT-qPCR; Table S2: Descriptors of the QSAR model for the tested anti-inflammatory active agents; Table S3: Observed and estimated anti-inflammatory properties for the tested compounds according to the BMLR-QSAR model; Table S4: Molecular descriptor values of the QSAR model for the tested compounds; Table S5: Descriptors of the QSAR model for the tested peripheral analgesic active agents; Table S6: Observed and estimated peripheral analgesic properties for the tested compounds according to the BMLR-QSAR model; Table S7: Molecular descriptor values of QSAR model for the peripheral analgesic active agents; Table S8: Descriptors of the QSAR model for the tested central analgesic active agents; Table S9: Observed and estimated central analgesic properties for the tested compounds according to the QSAR model; Table S10: Molecular descriptor values of the QSAR model for the central analgesic tested compounds.; 1HNMR spectra and 13C NMR spectra of 5a\u2013g and 8a\u2013g.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 1945 22 of 24\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, S.S.P.; methodology, R.M.B., S.S.P., A.S.G., S.N., M.S.B., M.W., S.K.S., A.M.G.; software, S.S.P., A.S.G., H.S.; validation, N.S., M.S.B., A.S.D.; formal analysis, R.M.B., S.S.P., N.S., M.F.S., A.A., S.N., M.S.B., A.S.D., H.S., M.W., S.K.S., A.M.G.; investigation, S.S.P., A.S.G., A.A., A.S.D.; data curation, R.M.B., M.F.S.; writing\u2014original draft preparation, R.M.B., S.S.P., A.S.G., N.S., M.F.S., A.A., S.N., M.S.B., A.S.D., H.S., S.K.S.; writing\u2014review and editing, S.S.P., A.S.G.; visualization, A.S.G., M.F.S.; supervision, S.S.P.; project administration, S.S.P.; funding acquisition, S.S.P.
