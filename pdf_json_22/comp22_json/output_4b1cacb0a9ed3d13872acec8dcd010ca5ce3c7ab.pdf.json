    "abstractText": "We propose an Eulerian-Lagrangian (EL) Runge-Kutta (RK) discontinuous Galerkin (DG) method for wave equations. The method is designed based on the ELDG method for transport problems [J. Comput. Phy. 446: 110632, 2021.], which tracks solution along approximations to characteristics in the DG framework, allowing extra large time stepping sizes with stability. The wave equation can be written as a first order hyperbolic system. Considering each characteristic family, a straightforward application of ELDG will be to transform to the characteristic variables, evolve them on associated characteristic related space-time regions, and transform them back to the original variables. However, the mass conservation could not be guaranteed in a general setting. In this paper, we formulate a mass conservative semi-discrete ELDG method by decomposing each variable into two parts, each of them associated with a different characteristic family. As a result, four different quantities are evolved in EL fashion and recombined to update the solution. The fully discrete scheme is formulated by using method-of-lines RK methods, with intermediate RK solutions updated on the background mesh. Numerical results on 1D and 2D wave equations are presented to demonstrate the performance of the proposed ELDG method. These include the high order spatial and temporal accuracy, stability with extra large time stepping size, and mass conservative property.",

Such a model could come from many fields of engineering, e.g. petroleum engineering, defense industry, telecommunication and geoscience ([12], [19]). There are many efficient DG methods for solving the second order wave equation. These include the interior penalty DG (IPDG) method[32, 14, 15], local DG method[1, 36, 8]. One can also reformulate the problem as a first-order hyperbolic system\nUt + d\u2211 j=1 (Aj(x, t)U)xj = 0, (x, t) \u2208 Rd \u00d7 [0, T ], (1.2)\nfor which DG [10] and space-time DG [13, 29] methods are available.\nOne effective numerical approach for solving the hyperbolic equation is the characteristic method,\nwhich updates time-dependent solution by tracking characteristics. For scalar hyperbolic equations, there have been many pioneering works. In [7], Celia etc. developed an Eulerian Lagrangian Localized Adjoint Methods (ELLAM) [7], which introduces an adjoint problem for each test function in the continuous finite element framework and has been applied to different problems [34, 33]. On the other hand, the ELDG [35, 6] and SLDG [4] are being developed in the discontinuous Galerkin finite element framework with a similar introduction of adjoint problems for test functions. Another line of development, that is closely related to this work, is the Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) DG method [20, 17]. Both ELDG and ALE-DG evolve the DG solution on a dynamic moving mesh: the dynamic mesh movement of the ELDG approximates characteristics for the potential of using larger time stepping sizes with stability, whereas the mesh movement of ALE-DG is designed for better shock resolution.\nIn this paper, we propose a mass conservative EL RK DG method for hyperbolic systems (1.2) with large time stepping sizes. We start from 1D cases, for which we consider characteristic variables and the associated characteristic space-time regions. For each characteristic family, a straightforward application of ELDG will be to transform to characteristic variables, evolve them on associated space-time regions, and transform them back to original variables. However, the mass conservation could not be guaranteed in a general setting. We decompose each variable into two parts, each of them associated with different characteristic families; as a result, four different quantities are evolved in EL fashion and recombined to update the solution. The fully discrete scheme is formulated by using method-of-lines RK methods, with intermediate RK solutions updated on the background mesh. For 2D hyperbolic systems, characteristic variables are no longer\nconstant along the bicharacteristics, characteristic Galerkin [30] or evolution Galerkin [3, 22, 23] methods have been proposed by taking into account information propagated in all bicharacteristic directions. However, the algorithm implementation is very complex. In this paper, we use the splitting method for higher dimensional problem, which maintain the simplicity of ELDG method for 1D cases, as well as other great properties such as mass conservation, high order spatial and temporal accuracy, and allows for extra large time steps with stability.\nThis paper is organized as follows. In Section 2, we review the ELDG for one-dimensional (1D) linear transport problems. In Section 3, we develop the ELDG method for a first-order hyperbolic system by evolving each component associated with each characteristic families, recombining them to update the solution. We also develop it to 2D problems by dimensional splitting. Mass conservation of ELDG schemes are proved. In Section 4, performance of the proposed ELDG method is shown through extensive numerical tests. Finally, concluding remarks are made in Section 5.\n2 Review of ELDG formulation for 1D linear transport problems\nTo illustrate the key idea of the ELDG scheme, we start from a 1D linear transport equation in the following form\nut + (a(x, t)u)x = 0, x \u2208 [xa, xb]. (2.1)\nFor simplicity, we assume periodic boundary conditions, and the velocity field a(x, t) is a continuous function of space and time. We perform a partition of the computational domain xa = x 1 2 < x 3 2 < \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 < xN+ 1 2 = xb as the background mesh partition. Let Ij = [xj\u2212 1 2 , xj+ 1 2 ] denote an element of length \u2206xj = xj+ 1 2 \u2212xj\u2212 1 2 and define \u2206x = maxj \u2206xj . We define the finite dimensional approximation space, V kh = {vh : vh|Ij \u2208 P k(Ij)}, where P k(Ij) denotes the set of polynomials of degree at most k. We let tn be the n-th time level and \u2206t = tn+1\u2212 tn to be the time-stepping size.\nThe key idea in the ELDG formulation is, design adjoint problems for test functions to take advantage of information propagation along characteristics. The ELDG method proposed in [6] is formulated on a space-time region \u2126j = I\u0303j(t)\u00d7 [tn, tn+1] with\nI\u0303j(t) = [x\u0303j\u2212 1 2 (t), x\u0303j+ 1 2 (t)], t \u2208 [tn, tn+1]\nbeing the dynamic interval, see Figure 2.1. Here x\u0303j\u00b1 1 2 (t) = xj\u00b1 1 2 + (t \u2212 tn+1)\u03bdj\u00b1 1 2 are straight lines emanating from cell boundaries xj\u00b1 1 2 with slopes \u03bdj\u00b1 1 2 = a(xj\u00b1 1 2 , tn+1) and I?j . = I\u0303j(t n) =\n[x\u2217 j\u2212 1\n2\n, x\u2217 j+ 1\n2\n] is the upstream cell of Ij at t n. The dynamic interval of I\u0303j(t) can always be linearly\nmapped to a reference cell \u03be in Ij by a mapping. A local adjoint problem of (2.1) for the test\nfunction is defined as: \u00ae \u03c8t + \u03b1(x, t)\u03c8x = 0, (x, t) \u2208 \u2126j , \u03c8(t = tn+1) = \u03a8(x). \u2200\u03a8(x) \u2208 P k(Ij).\n(2.2)\nHere \u03b1(x, t) is a bilinear function of (x, t) with \u2200t \u2208 [tn, tn+1],\n\u03b1(xj\u2212 1 2 , tn+1) = a(xj\u2212 1 2 , tn+1)\n. = \u03bdj\u2212 1\n2 , \u03b1(xj+ 1 2 , tn+1) = a(xj+ 1 2 , tn+1)\n. = \u03bdj+ 1\n2 , (2.3)\nand\n\u03b1(x, t) = \u2212\u03bdj\u2212 1 2\nx\u2212 x\u0303j+ 1 2 (t)\n\u2206xj(t) + \u03bdj+ 1 2\nx\u2212 x\u0303j\u2212 1 2 (t)\n\u2206xj(t) \u2208 P 1([x\u0303j\u2212 1 2 (t), x\u0303j+ 1 2 (t)]). (2.4)\nNotice that the test function \u03c8 stays the same polynomial, if I\u0303j(t) is mapped to a reference interval Ij . The ELDG [6] scheme can be formulated by \u222b I\u0303j(t) (2.2) \u00b7 u+ (2.1) \u00b7 \u03c8\nd dt \u222b I\u0303j(t) (u\u03c8)dx = \u2212 \u00c4 F\u0302\u03c8 \u00e4 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223x\u0303j+ 12 (t) + \u00c4F\u0302\u03c8\u00e4 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223x\u0303j\u2212 12 (t) + \u222bI\u0303j(t) F\u03c8xdx. (2.5)\nwhere F (u) . = (a\u2212 \u03b1)u and F\u0302 is the Lax-Friedrichs flux. A method-of-lines RK discretization can be used for high order temporal accuracy [6].\n3 The ELDG algorithm for wave equation.\nThe design of the ELDG algorithm for wave equation shares a similar spirit as the 1D scalar case. We start from a 1D wave equation. We first rewrite it as a linear system and formulate the ELDG scheme by tracking information along different characteristics families.\n3.1 1D wave equation\nWe consider the wave equation\nutt = (a 2(x)ux)x + f(x, t). (3.1)\nFor simplicity, we assume periodic boundary conditions, and the velocity field a(x) is a continuous and periodic function of space. Let u1 = ut and u 2 = ux, then we can rewrite (3.1) as a linear system\nUt + (AU)x = F, (3.2)\nwhere\nU =\n\u00ef u1\nu2\n\u00f2 , A(x) = \u00ef 0 \u2212a2(x) \u22121 0 \u00f2 , F = \u00ef f(x, t) 0 \u00f2 .\nWe use the following notations for the eigen-decomposition of A(x):\n\u2022 eigenvalue: \u03bb(1)(x), \u03bb(2)(x), where \u03bb(1)(x) = a(x), \u03bb(2)(x) = \u2212a(x) for wave equation.\n\u2022 A(x) = R(x)\u039bR\u22121(x), where \u039b(x) = diag(\u03bb(1)(x), \u03bb(2)(x)),\nR(x) = \u00ef r11(x) r12(x) r21(x) r22(x) \u00f2 = \u00ef \u2212a(x) a(x) 1 1 \u00f2 (3.3)\ncontains the right eigenvectors, and\nR\u22121(x) = \u00ef l11(x) l12(x) l21(x) l22(x) \u00f2 = \u00f1 \u22121 2a(x) 1 2 1 2a(x) 1 2 \u00f4 . = \u00f1 l(1)(x) l(2)(x) \u00f4 (3.4)\ncontains the left eigenvectors.\nIn the following, we propose a mass conservative ELDG scheme for the system (3.2) by the\nprocedure below. The notion of its background meshes is the same as the 1D scalar case. (1) Two partitions of space-time regions \u2126 (1) j and \u2126 (2) j . According to the first and second characteristic families, we partition the computational domain as two sets of space-time regions \u2126 (1) j and \u2126 (2) j respectively. Here \u2126 (1) j = I\u0303 (1) j (t) \u00d7 [tn, tn+1] is related to the first characteristic family. I\u0303 (1) j (t) = [x\u0303 (1)\nj\u2212 1 2\n(t), x\u0303 (1)\nj+ 1 2 (t)] is the dynamic interval emanating from cell boundaries xj\u00b1 1 2\nwith slopes \u03bd (1)\nj\u00b1 1 2\napproximating the first characteristic velocity, see Figure 3.2 (left). In general, we\nchoose \u03bd (1)\nj\u00b1 1 2 = \u03bb(1)(xj\u00b1 1 2 ). I ?,(1) j . = I\u0303 (1) j (t n) is the upstream cell of Ij from the first characteristic\nfamily at tn. The dynamic interval I\u0303 (1) j (t) can be linearly mapped to a reference cell \u03be \u2208 Ij , (see\nFigure 2.1). Here, we let x\u0303(1)(\u03c4 ; (\u03be, tn+1)) be the linear map from I\u0303 (1) j (t) to Ij . Similar definition can be made to \u2126 (2) j , I\u0303 (2) j (t) and I ?,(2) j for the second characteristic family. See Figure 3.2 (right) for illustration of \u2126 (2) j .\n(2) Adjoint Problems. We consider an adjoint problem for the first characteristic family on \u2126 (1) j :\u00ae\n(\u03c8(1))t + \u03b1 (1)(\u03c8(1))x = 0, t \u2208 [tn, tn+1], (\u03c8(1))(t = tn+1) = \u03a8(1)(x), (3.5)\nwhere\n\u03b1(1)(x, t) = \u2212\u03bd(1) j\u2212 1\n2\nx\u2212 x\u0303(1) j+ 1\n2\n(t)\n\u2206x (1) j (t)\n+ \u03bd (1)\nj+ 1 2\nx\u2212 x\u0303(1) j\u2212 1\n2\n(t)\n\u2206x (1) j (t)\n\u2208 P 1(I\u0303(1)j (t)). (3.6)\nSimilarly on \u2126 (2) j : \u00ae\n(\u03c8(2))t + \u03b1 (2)(\u03c8(2))x = 0, t \u2208 [tn, tn+1], (\u03c8(2))(t = tn+1) = \u03a8(2)(x), (3.7)\nwhere\n\u03b1(2)(x, t) = \u2212\u03bd(2) j\u2212 1\n2\nx\u2212 x\u0303(2) j+ 1\n2\n(t)\n\u2206x (2) j (t)\n+ \u03bd (2)\nj+ 1 2\nx\u2212 x\u0303(2) j\u2212 1\n2\n(t)\n\u2206x (2) j (t)\n\u2208 P 1(I\u0303(2)j (t)). (3.8)\n(3) Formulation of a mass-conservative semi-discrete ELDG scheme. Before we present a mass-conservative semi-discrete ELDG scheme, we formulate the scheme by a localized characteristic field. In particular, a piecewise constant aj approximating a(x) in (3.4) is defined on Ij , and the corresponding\nRj =\n\u00f1 r11j r 12 j\nr21j r 22 j\n\u00f4 = \u00ef \u2212aj aj\n1 1\n\u00f2 (3.9)\nand\nR\u22121j =\n\u00f1 \u22121 2aj 1 2\n1 2aj 1 2\n\u00f4 . = [ l (1) j\nl (2) j\n] . (3.10)\nDefine l (1) j is locally defined on \u2126 (1) j approximating l (1)(x). For simplicity, we only present the first order ELDG scheme. Take the vector product of l (1) j from left with (3.2), we have a scalar equation\nl (1) j (Ut + (A(x)U)x) = l (1) j F (x, t). (3.11)\nNext, integrating over the space-time interval I\u0303 (1) j (t), then we have\nd dt \u222b I\u0303\n(1) j (t)\n(l (1) j U)dx+ l (1) j (A(x)U \u2212 \u03bd (1)\nj+ 1 2\nU)| x\u0303 (1)\nj+ 12\n(t) \u2212 l(1)j (A(x)U \u2212 \u03bd (1)\nj\u2212 1 2\nU)| x\u0303 (1)\nj\u2212 12 (t)\n= \u222b I\u0303\n(1) j (t)\nl (1) j F (x, t)dx.\n(3.12)\nThe first order ELDG discretization of eq. (3.12) is to find l (1) j Uh(x, t) \u2208 P 0(I\u0303 (1) j (t)), so that\nd dt \u222b I\u0303\n(1) j (t)\nl (1) j Uhdx = \u2212 \u00f1 l (1) j \u00a4 (A(x)Uh \u2212 \u03bd (1)\nj+ 1 2 Uh)|j+ 1 2\n\u00f4 + \u00f1 l (1) j \u00a4 (A(x)Uh \u2212 \u03bd (1)\nj\u2212 1 2 Uh)|j\u2212 1 2 \u00f4 +\n\u222b I\u0303\n(1) j (t)\nl (1) j F (x, t)dx . = L1(Uh(t), t, I\u0303 (1) j (t)).\n(3.13)\nHere \u201df11 at a cell boundary can be taken as a monotone flux, e.g. the Lax-Friedrichs flux\u00a4 (AU \u2212 \u03bd(1)\nj+ 1 2 U) j+ 1\n2\n= 1\n2\n( A(x+\nj+ 1 2\n)U+ j+ 1\n2\n\u2212 \u03bd(1) j+ 1\n2\nU+ j+ 1\n2\n+A(x\u2212 j+ 1\n2\n)U\u2212 j+ 1\n2\n\u2212 \u03bd(1) j+ 1\n2\nU\u2212 j+ 1\n2 \u2212 \u03b11,2(U+j+ 1 2 \u2212 U\u2212 j+ 1 2\n) )\nwhere \u03b11,2 = max{|\u03bb(1)(xj+ 1 2 )\u2212 \u03bd(1) j+ 1 2 |, |\u03bb(2)(xj+ 1 2 )\u2212 \u03bd(2) j+ 1 2 |}. Similarly, we can easily update l(2)j Uh related to \u03bb(2) in the following:\nd dt \u222b I\u0303\n(2) j (t)\nl (2) j Uhdx = \u2212 \u00f1 l (2) j \u00a4 (A(x)Uh \u2212 \u03bd (2)\nj+ 1 2 Uh)|j+ 1 2\n\u00f4 + \u00f1 l (2) j \u00a4 (A(x)Uh \u2212 \u03bd (2)\nj\u2212 1 2 Uh)|j\u2212 1 2 \u00f4 +\n\u222b I\u0303\n(2) j (t)\nl (2) j F (x, t)dx . = L2(Uh(t), t, I\u0303 (2) j (t)),\n(3.14)\nwhere l (2) j is a constant vector, locally defined on I\u0303 (2) j (t) approximating l (2)(x). A simple first order ELDG scheme is composed by two evolution equations (3.13) and (3.14). That is, we can update u1h by (3.13),(3.14) and u 1 h = (r 11 j l (1) j + r 12 j l\n(2) j )Uh:\u222b\nIj\nu1,n+1h dx = \u222b Ij r11j l (1) j U n+1 h dx+ \u222b Ij r12j l (2) j U n+1 h dx\n= r11j \u222b I \u2217,(1) j l (1) j U n h dx+ r 11 j \u222b tn+1 tn L1(U (1) h (t), t, I\u0303 (1) j (t))dt + r12j\n\u222b I \u2217,(2) j l (2) j U n h dx+ r 12 j \u222b tn+1 tn L2(U (2) h (t), t, I\u0303 (2) j (t))dt,\n(3.15)\nwhere Unh and U n+1 h are defined on the background mesh Ij , U (1) h (t) and U (2) h (t) are defined on the space-time dynamic meshes I\u0303 (1) j (t) and I\u0303 (2) j (t) respectively. Similarly, we can update u 2 h.\nWe apply forward-Euler method for time discretization with above ELDG scheme (3.15):\u222b Ij u1,n+1dx = r11j\n\u222b I \u2217,(1) j l (1) j U ndx\u2212\u2206t r11j l (1) j \u00f1 \u00a4 (A(x)Un \u2212 \u03bd(1) j+ 1 2 Un)| x ?,(1) j+ 12 \u2212 \u00a4 (A(x)U \u2212 \u03bd(1) j\u2212 1 2 U)| x ?,(1) j\u2212 12 \u00f4 + r12j\n\u222b I \u2217,(2) j l (2) j U ndx\u2212\u2206t r12j l (2) j \u00f1 \u00a4 (A(x)Un \u2212 \u03bd(2) j+ 1 2 Un)| x ?,(2) j+ 12 \u2212 \u00a4 (A(x)U \u2212 \u03bd(2) j\u2212 1 2 U)| x ?,(2) j\u2212 12 \u00f4 .\n(3.16)\nRemark 3.1. The above ELDG scheme is not mass conservative for two reasons:\n(1) Flux terms can\u2019t cancel each other as r11j l (1) j and r 12 j l (2) j are discontinuous across cell boundary\nof \u2126 (1) j ,\u2126 (2) j .\n(2) \u2211\nj r 11 j \u222b I \u2217,(1) j l (1) j U ndx + r12j \u222b I \u2217,(2) j l (2) j U ndx 6= \u2211 j \u222b Ij Undx because of the inconsistency in\ncharacteristic transformations between neighboring cells among r11j l (1) j and r 12 j l (2) j .\nTo obtain the mass conservation, a critical point is that eigen-decomposition has to be consistent\namong two characteristic families and independent of partitions \u2126 (1) j ,\u2126 (2) j . We choose ap(x) as a continuous approximation of a(x) which leads that Rp(x),\u039bp(x), R \u22121 p (x) are the approximations of R(x),\u039b(x), R\u22121(x) respectively, where\nRp(x) =\n\u00ef rp11(x) r p 12(x)\nrp21(x) r p 22(x)\n\u00f2 = \u00ef \u2212ap(x) ap(x)\n1 1\n\u00f2 (3.17)\nand\nR\u22121p (x) =\n\u00ef lp11(x) l p 12(x)\nlp21(x) l p 22(x)\n\u00f2 = \u00f1 \u22121 2ap(x) 1 2\n1 2ap(x) 1 2\n\u00f4 . = \u00f1 l (1) p (x)\nl (2) p (x)\n\u00f4 . (3.18)\nThe following equalities hold\n(rp11(x)l (1) p (x) + r p 12(x)l (2) p (x))U(x) = u 1, (rp21(x)l (1) p (x) + r p 22(x)l (2) p (x))U(x) = u 2, (3.19)\nfrom Rp(x)R \u22121 p (x) = R \u22121 p (x)Rp(x) = I. They are critical to design a mass-conservative ELDG scheme. Take the vector product of rp11(x)l (1) p (x) from left with (3.2), we have a scalar equation\nrp11(x)l (1) p (x)(Ut + (A(x)U)x) = r p 11(x)l (1) p (x)F (x, t).

We can similarly obtain the ELDG scheme for u2h.\n(4) Fully discrete ELDG scheme with method-of-lines RK schemes.\nTo update (3.28) from Unh to U n+1 h , we first apply the forward Euler time discretization to get 1st order accuracy, then we generalize the scheme to general RK methods. There are two main steps involved here. In order to describe the implementation procedure of the fully discrete ELDG scheme, we define the L2 projection.\nDefinition 3.2. (L2 projection) Let u(x) \u2208 L2(\u2126), M = {Ij}Nj=1 and M\u0303 = {I\u0303j}Nj=1 be two different meshes of \u2126. We have function spaces V kh = {u(x) : u|Ij \u2208 P k(Ij), \u2200j} and V\u0303 kh = {u\u0303(x) : u\u0303|I\u0303j \u2208 P k(I\u0303j), \u2200j} corresponding to meshes M and M\u0303 . The L2 projection of uM \u2208 V kh onto space V\u0303 kh can be defined as, find u\u0303M\u0303 (x) \u2208 V\u0303 k h , s.t.\u222b\nI\u0303j\nu\u0303M\u0303 (x)\u03d5(x)dx = \u222b I\u0303j uM (x)\u03d5(x)dx, \u2200\u03d5(x) \u2208 V\u0303 kh . (3.30)\nWe denote u\u0303M\u0303 (x) = Proj[uM (x);M,M\u0303 ]. The evaluation of the right hand side of (3.30) can be done in a subinterval-by-subinterval fashion. The implementation details can be found in [16].\nThen, we propose a fully discrete EL RK DG scheme with procedure as described:\n1. Obtain the initial condition on upstream meshes I\u0303 (1) j (t n) and I\u0303 (2) j (t n) of (3.28) by U (1) h (t n) =\nProj[Unh ; Ij , I\u0303 (1) j (t n)] and U (2) h (t n) = Proj[Unh ; Ij , I\u0303 (2) j (t n)], which are the L2 projections of solutions from the background mesh to the upstream mesh.\n2.

We compute the four integration terms of\n(3.31) \u222b I \u2217,(1) j rp11l (1) p Unh\u03c8 (1),ndx, \u222b I \u2217,(2) j rp12l (2) p Unh\u03c8 (2),ndx, \u222b I\u0303 (1) j (t n) (rp11l (1) p )xAU n h\u03c8 (1)(x, tn)dx\nand \u222b I\u0303\n(2) j (t\nn) (rp12l (2) p )xAU n h\u03c8 (2)(x, tn)dx highlighted in blue with Unh on background meshes\nin order to makes the scheme satisfy mass conservation. Thus they have to be evaluated subinterval-by-subinterval since DG solution is discontinuous. In summary, we can get u1,n+1h on Ij by (3.31). Similarly, we can get u 2,n+1 h on Ij .\n0 1 1\n1 2 1 2\nTable 3.1: SSPRK2 Butcher Tableau\n(b2) For SSPRK2 method with Butcher tableau: 3.1, we get u1h(t (1)) from (3.31), then com-\npute \u222b Ij u1,n+1h \u03a8(x)dx = \u222b I \u2217,(1) j rp11l (1) p U n h\u03c8 (1),ndx+ 0.5\u2206tL11(Uh(t (1)), t(1), Ij)\n+ \u222b I \u2217,(2) j rp12l (2) p U n h\u03c8 (2),ndx+ 0.5\u2206tL12(Uh(t (1)), t(1), Ij),\n(3.32)\nwhere t(1) = tn+1, u1h(t (1)) and u2h(t (1)) are defined on background mesh Ij .\n(b3) For general RK methods with intermediate stages, we will update intermediate RK\nsolutions on background mesh as in [11]. For example, for a 2nd order RK method with Butcher tableau 3.2. It has an intermediate stage at t(1) = tn+ \u2206t 2 , we propose the following steps as [11], see Figure 3.3.\ni. We denote the dynamic domain tracking Ij from t (1) to tn with speed \u03bd\n(1) j\u00b1 1 2 at mesh\npoint xj\u00b1 1 2\nas I\u0303 (1) j,(1)(t), see the green domain in Figure 3.3. I\u0303 (2) j,(1)(t) related to second\ncharacteristic is defined similarly. Then we can update U (1) h on I\u0303 (1) j,(1)(t) and I\u0303 (2) j,(1)(t) from tn to t(1) as in a forward-Euler method.\nii. We update Un+1h on dynamic domain I\u0303 (1) j (t) and I\u0303 (2) j (t) from U n h with projection\nonto I \u2217,(1) j and Uh(t (1)) with projection onto I\u0303 (1) j,(1)(t (1)).\nTheorem 3.3. (Mass conservation) The proposed fully discrete ELDG scheme is locally mass conservative. In particular, given a DG solution uh(x, t n) \u2208 V kh with a periodic boundary condition, we have N\u2211 i=1 \u222b Ij Uh(x, t n+1)dx = N\u2211 i=1 \u222b Ij Uh(x, t n)dx. Proof. We firstly consider the forward Euler time discretization. Taking \u03a8 = 1 and F = 0 in the\nscheme (3.31), we have\u222b \u2126 u1,n+1h dx = \u2211 j \u222b Ij u1,n+1h dx\n= \u2211 j [\u222b I \u2217,(1) j rp11l (1) p U n h dx+ \u2206t ( \u2212\u2018f11 j+ 1 2 (U (1) h (t n)) + \u2018f11 j\u2212 1 2 (U (1) h (t n)) + \u222b I \u2217,(1) j (rp11l (1) p )xAU n h dx )]\n+ \u2211 j [\u222b I \u2217,(2) j rp12l (2) p U n h dx+ \u2206t ( \u2212\u2018f12 j+ 1 2 (U (2) h (t n)) + \u2018f12 j\u2212 1 2 (U (2) h (t n)) + \u222b I \u2217,(2) j (rp12l (2) p )xAU n h dx )]\n= \u2211 j (\u222b I \u2217,(1) j rp11l (1) p U n h dx+ \u222b I \u2217,(2) j rp12l (2) p U n h dx )\n+ \u2206t \u2211 j (\u222b I \u2217,(1) j (rp11l (1) p )xAU n h dx+ \u222b I \u2217,(2) j (rp12l (2) p )xAU n h dx ) =\n\u222b \u2126 (rp11l (1) p + r p 12l (2) p )U n h dx+ \u2206t \u222b \u2126 (rp11l (1) p + r p 12l (2) p )xAU n h dx\n= \u222b \u2126 u1,nh dx,\n(3.33)\nwhich follows from the cancellation of unique fluxes at cell boundaries, rp11l (1) p + r p 12l (2) p = [1, 0] and (3.19) with integration in a subinterval-by-subinterval fashion. The mass conservation for the fully discrete ELDG scheme can be proved in a similar fashion.\nRemark 3.4. To maintain the mass-conservative property, the choice of eigenvectors Rp(x) is not necessarily exact for ELDG scheme, as long as Rp(x) and R \u22121 p (x) are a consistent pair throughout the domain.\n3.2 2D linear wave equation\nThe solution for high-dimensional hyperbolic systems is given by means of a characteristic cone, rather than individual characteristic lines. Numerically, characteristic Galerkin [30] or evolution Galerkin [3, 22, 23] methods have been proposed and developed to solve high dimensional hyperbolic system. This method is constructed by taking into account information propagated in all bicharacteristic directions and involving integrals around the characteristic cone. However, the awkward integrals over the mantle, involving intermediate times, limit both the accuracy and the stability of the resulting schemes. Thus the finite volume evolution Galerkin (FVEG) schemes are introduced, which is in a predictor-corrector plus finite volume framework to get higher accuracy. FVEG method has been developed in [28] and widely applied in [21, 28, 24], and the stability and\naccuracy have been investigated in [25, 28, 27, 26]. Even though the FVEG method can achieve high-order accuracy and stability with extra large step, the algorithm implementation is still very complex for high-dimensional problems. In this paper, we use the splitting method for higher dimensional problem.\nConsider a linear 2D wave equation\nutt = (a(x, y, t)ux)x + (b(x, y, t)uy)y, (x, y) \u2208 \u2126. (3.34)\nIt can be written as a first order linear hyperbolic system\nUt + (A(x, y, t)U)x + (B(x, y, t)U)y = 0, (x, y) \u2208 \u2126, (3.35)\nwhere\nU = utux uy  , A =  0 \u2212a(x, y, t) 0\u22121 0 0 0 0 0  , B =  0 0 \u2212b(x, y, t)0 0 0 \u22121 0 0  . The domain \u2126 is partitioned into rectangular meshes with each computational cell \u2126ij = [xi\u2212 1\n2 , xi+ 1 2 ]\u00d7\n[yj+ 1 2 , yj+ 1 2 ], where we use the piecewise Qk tensor-product polynomial spaces. Then we extend ELDG algorithm to 2D problems via dimensional splitting [31].\n1. We first locate (k + 1)2 tensor-product Gaussian nodes on cell \u2126ij : (xi,p, yj,q), p, q = 0, ..., k.\nFor example, see Figure 3.4 (left) for the case of k = 3.\n2. Then, the equation (3.35) is split into two 1D hyperbolic problems based on the quadrature\nnodes in both x\u2212 and y\u2212 directions:\nUt + (A(x, y, t)U)x = 0, (3.36)\nUt + (B(x, y, t)U)y = 0. (3.37)\nBased on a 1D ELDG formulation, the split equations (3.36) and (3.37) are evolved via Strang splitting over a time step \u2206t as follows.\n\u2022 Evolve 1D equation (3.36) at different y\u2032j,qs for a half time-step \u2206t/2, see Figure 3.4\n(middle). For each yj,q, the (k+1) point values are mapped to a P k polynomial per cell, then the 1D system (3.36) is evolved by the proposed ELDG scheme. Finally, we can map the evolved P k polynomial back to the (k+ 1) point values to update the solution. \u2022 Evolve 1D system (3.37) at different x\u2032i,ps for a full time-step \u2206t as above, see Figure\n3.4 (right).\n\u2022 Evolve 1D system (3.36) at different y\u2032j,qs for another half time-step \u2206t/2.\nThe splitting 2D ELDG formulation maintains high order accuracy in space, extra large time stepping size with stability and mass conservation; and has a second order splitting error.\n4 Numerical results\nIn this section, we show numerical results of the proposed scheme for wave equations. We set the time stepping size as \u2206t = CFLa \u2206x for 1D and \u2206t = CFL a\n\u2206x + b \u2206y\n, where a and b are maximum\neigenvalues of coefficient matrixes in x- and y-directions respectively. We use RK4 [18] for time discretization. We study the following aspects: the spatial order of convergence by using small enough time stepping sizes, the spatial super-convergence of the post-processed solutions [2, 9] produced by convolving the ELDG solution with a suitable kernel consisting of B-splines for the purpose of improving spatial convergence rate, the temporal order of convergence and numerical stability under a large time stepping size by varying CFL for a fixed spatial mesh.\n4.1 1D wave equations\nExample 4.1. (1D wave equation with constant coefficient.) We consider the 1D wave equation eq. (3.1) with constant coefficient a(x) = 1 and the source term f(x, t) = 0. The initial data is u(x, 0) = sin(x), x \u2208 [0, 2\u03c0] with periodic boundary condition. The exact solution is u(x, t) = sin(x+t). For the constant coefficient problem, if using exact characteristic velocity fields for spacetime partition and exact eigenvectors, the proposed ELDG method is the same as SL DG, then it is\nunconditionally stable. Here we perturb the characteristic velocity \u03bd (1)\nj+ 1 2\nin (3.6) at cell boundaries\nand/or ap(x) in (3.17) related to approximating eigenvectors to get ELDG, ELDG1, ELDG2 and ELDG3 schemes respectively. Similarly we implement the non mass-conservative ELDG methods denoted as NMC ELDG, NMC ELDG1, NMC ELDG2 and NMC ELDG3. Related parameters of these ELDG methods are given in Table 4.3.\nTable 4.4 and 4.5 report spatial accuracies of the ELDG, ELDG1, ELDG2 and ELDG3 methods for this example under the same time stepping size without and with post-processing technique [2, 9]. We can observe the optimal convergence rate k+ 1 and 2k+ 1. We vary time stepping sizes, with fixed well-resolved spatial meshes, and plot error vs. CFL in Figure 4.5 and 4.6 for ELDG, ELDG1, ELDG2 and ELDG3 schemes without and with post-processed technique respectively, after a long time T = 100. The plots from post-processed ELDG schemes better show the fourth order temporal convergence. ELDG2 and ELDG3 perform comparably; they have a more restricted time step constraint than ELDG1. It indicates that, stability is affected by approximations of characteristic via the space-time partition and approximation of eigenvectors. We also note that, in both Figure 4.5 and 4.6, the CFL allowed with stability is much larger than that of the RK DG method which is 12k+1 . Further, we verify the mass conservative property of the ELDG schemes are around machine precision and the non-mass conservative property of the NMC ELDG schemes is presented in Figure 4.7.\nExample 4.2. Then, we test the ELDG schemes for eq. (3.1) with a Gaussian initial condition\nu1 = exp(\u2212 x 2\n0.005 ), u2 = 0.\nThe computational domain is [\u22121, 1] with the periodic boundary conditions. The exact solutions u1 = 0.5(exp(\u2212 (x+t) 2\n0.005 ) + exp(\u2212 (x\u2212t)2 0.005 )) and u 2 = 0.5(exp(\u2212 (x+t) 2 0.005 ) \u2212 exp(\u2212 (x\u2212t)2 0.005 )) are the super-\nposition of two Gaussian functions with a periodic extensions. We plot u1 ELDG3 with P 1 and\nP 2 numerical solutions at time T = 50.5 for this system in Figure 4.8. We can observed that there is no significant phase difference with a long time simulation, meanwhile the dissipation can be\nimproved by the mesh refinement and higher order spatial approximation.\nExample 4.3. Next, we test the ELDG schemes for eq. (3.1) on [0, 2\u03c0] with the periodic boundary conditions and the following discontinuous initial condition\nu10(x) = 1., if 0.95\u03c0 \u2264 x \u2264 1.05\u03c0,0.5, otherwise, u20(x) = 1.\n(4.1)\nThe exact solutions u1 and u2 are discontinuous piecewise constants with moving discontinuities. It is a challenging test for controlling oscillations around discontinuities. We adopt a simple TVD limiter on background mesh at each RK stages with M = 0 in [10] for all schemes. As shown in\nFigure 4.5, the CFL constraint with stability is slightly less than 1 for ELDG3 scheme. We plot the numerical solutions u1 of ELDG3 scheme with P 1 and P 2, CFL = 0.9 in Figure 4.9. It is found that oscillations are well controlled with the TVD limiter and ELDG method performs well for large time stepping size. Moreover, we track the mass conservation of ELDG methods VS NMC ELDG methods for eq. (3.1) and present results in Figure 4.10. It shows that the ELDG schemes maintain the mass conservation at the level of machine error, while the NMC ELDG schemes do not.\nExample 4.4. (1D wave equation with variable coefficient and source term.) We consider the 1D wave equation eq. (3.1) with variable coefficient a(x) = 2+sin(x) and exact solution u(x, t) = sin(x\u2212\n2t) is periodic on [0, 2\u03c0]. The source term is f(x, t) = \u22124 sin(x\u22122t)+sin(x\u22122t)(2+sin(x))2\u22122(2+ sin(x)) cos(x) cos(x\u22122t). For computation, we choose mesh velocity \u03bd(1) j+ 1\n2\n= a(xj+ 1 2 ), \u03bd\n(2) j+ 1 2 = \u2212\u03bd(1) j+ 1 2\nand exact eigenvectors with ap(x) = 2 + sin(x) in (3.17).\nThe expected optimal spatial accuracies of the ELDG methods without and with post-processing technique are shown in Table 4.6 and Table 4.7 respectively. In Figure 4.11 and 4.12, we plot the L\u221e error versus CFL of ELDG methods without and with post-processing technique respectively. The following observations are made: (1) The high order accuracy of the RK method reduce the error magnitude when large time stepping size is used; (2) The ELDG methods with RK4 time discretization perform well around and before CFL = 1, which is well above the stability constraint of the RK DG method 1/(2k + 1) for P k approximations. (3) After CFL = 1 and before stability constraint of the method, the temporal convergence order is observed to be consistent with the\norder of RK discretization; (4) The ELDG methods with post-processing technique have smaller error magnitute than those without post-processing.\nExample 4.5. (Two-dimensional linear system with constant coefficient matrices.) The second\norder wave equation utt = uxx + uyy can be written as the following first order linear hyperbolic system:  \u00c7 u v \u00e5 t + \u00c7 \u22121 0 0 1 \u00e5\u00c7 u v \u00e5 x + \u00c7 0 \u22121 \u22121 0 \u00e5\u00c7 u v \u00e5 y = \u00c7 0 0 \u00e5 , u(x, y, 0) = 1 2 \u221a 2 sin(x+ y)\u2212 1 2 \u221a 2 cos(x+ y),\nv(x, y, 0) = \u221a\n2\u22121 2 \u221a 2 sin(x+ y) +\n\u221a 2+1\n2 \u221a 2 cos(x+ y)\n(4.2)\nwith period boundary conditions in both x and y directions. The exact solution is{ u(x, y, t) = 1\n2 \u221a 2 sin(x+ y +\n\u221a 2t)\u2212 1\n2 \u221a 2 cos(x+ y \u2212\n\u221a 2t),\nv(x, y, t) = \u221a\n2\u22121 2 \u221a 2 sin(x+ y +\n\u221a 2t) + \u221a 2+1\n2 \u221a 2 cos(x+ y \u2212\n\u221a 2t).\n(4.3)\nWe notice that the two matrices in equation (4.2) don\u2019t commute, thus the linear system can not be reduced to 2-D scalar problems. We test accuracy for Qk ELDG methods with RK4 and 4th splitting method [5] at T = 1 for k = 1, 2 with CFL = 0.1 in Table 4.8. As expected, the (k+ 1)th order convergence is observed for these methods. We plot the L\u221e error versus CFL of ELDG methods with Q1 (left) and Q2 (right) polynomial spaces for this case with Strang splitting and 4th order splitting in Figure 4.13, which shows that second and forth order splitting errors are dominant when time-stepping sizes are large enough. The CFL constraint with stability for ELDG method is larger than that for general RK DG method when high order time discretization is applied.\nExample 4.6. (Two-dimensional linear system with variable coefficient matrices.) The second order wave equation utt = (a 2(x, y)ux)x + (b 2(x, y)uy)y can be written as the following first order\nlinear hyperbolic system: \u00d6 u1 u2\nu3 \u00e8 t +\n \u00d6\n0 \u2212(a(x, y))2 0 \u22121 0 0 0 0 0\n\u00e8\u00d6 u1\nu2 u3 \u00e8 x +  \u00d6 0 0 \u2212(b(x, y))2) 0 0 0 \u22121 0 0 \u00e8\u00d6 u1 u2 u3 \u00e8 y = \u00d6 0 0 0 \u00e8 .\n(4.4)\nThe simplest case is to choose a(x, y) = b(x, y) = 1, computational domain [\u22121, 1] \u00d7 [\u22121, 1] with periodic boundary condition and the Gaussian function initial condition: u1(x, y, 0) = exp(\u2212x 2+y2 0.005 ), u2(x, y, 0) = 0,\nu3(x, y, 0) = 0.\n(4.5)\nFor this example, we show the numerical ELDG Q2 solution u1 at times T = 0.5; 1; 1.5; 2 in Figure 4.14.\nNext we consider the system (4.4) with the initial condition u1(x, y, 0) = 2 cos(x+ y), u2(x, y, 0) = cos(x+ y),\nu3(x, y, 0) = cos(x+ y),\n(4.6)\nwhere a(x, y) = 1+0.5 sin(x+y), b(x, y) = \u221a (4\u2212 (1 + 0.5 sin(x+ y))2) and the boundary condition is periodic in both x and y directions. The exact solution is u1(x, y, t) = 2 cos(x+ y + 2t), u2(x, y, t) = cos(x+ y + 2t),\nu3(x, y, t) = cos(x+ y + 2t).\n(4.7)\nWe report the spatial accuracy of Qk ELDG methods in Table 4.9. The expected optimal convergence is observed. We plot the L\u221e error versus CFL of ELDG methods in Figure 4.15. The ELDG\nmethods perform as well as that for the linear system with constant coefficient matrices, and the CFL allowed with stability is much larger than that of the RK DG method.\n5 Conclusion\nIn this paper, we have developed a mass-conservative Eulerian-Lagrangian discontinuous Galerkin (ELDG) method for wave equations written in the form of hyperbolic systems. The new framework track the information of each characteristic family by the corresponding characteristic region, and combine in a mass-conservative fashion; The method inherits advantages in stability under large time stepping sizes, and in mass conservation, compactness and high order accuracy. These advantages are numerically verified by extensive numerical tests for 1D and 2D linear wave equations. Future works include further theoretic development and application of ELDG methods for nonlinear hyperbolic problems.\n6 Appendix (The notation of test function)\nWe give some notations which is used in the implementation of the fully discrete ELDG scheme with RK time discretization. For convenience, we only give the definitions related to \u2126 (1) j below because we can similarly get the definitions related to \u2126 (2) j . As scalar case, we take test function \u03c8(1)(x, t) as \u03c8 (1) j,m(x, t) = \u03a8j,m(x \u2212 \u03b1(1)(t \u2212 tn+1)) in the adjoint problem which is a set of basis of P k(I\u0303 (1) j (t)), where I\u0303 (1) j (t) is donated by a domain related \u03bb (1) as I\u0303j(t) in scalar problem. Here, we also take \u03a8j,m as orthogonal basis on Ij , and let\nu 1,(1) h (x, t) = k\u2211 l=0 u\u0302 1,(1);(l) j (t)\u03c8 (1) j,l (x, t), on I\u0303 (1) j (t), (6.1)\nwhere u\u03021,(1);(l) are coefficients for the basis. Let U\u0302 1,(1) j (t) = (u\u0302 1,(1);(0) j (t), \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , u\u0302 1,(1);(k) j (t)) T be the coefficient vector of size (k + 1)\u00d7 1. Then we have\n[ \u222b I\u0303\n(1) j (t)\nu 1,(1) h (x, t)\u03c8 (1) j,0 (x, t)dx, ..., \u222b I\u0303\n(1) j (t)\nu 1,(1) h (x, t)\u03c8 (1) j,k (x, t)dx] T = U\u0302 1,(1) j (t),\u2200t \u2208 [t n, tn+1].\nU\u0302 2,(1) j (t) can be similarly defined. Similar definition can be made to \u2126 (2) j and \u03c8 (2)(x, t) for the second characteristics family.\nReferences\n[1] M. Baccouch.
