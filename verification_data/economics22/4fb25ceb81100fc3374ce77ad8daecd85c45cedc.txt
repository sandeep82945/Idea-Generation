Based on the provided text, the future research directions mentioned are as follows:

1. "Future increased ownership of private cars and its impact on transportation will also change the retail layout."
2. "Considering the flexibility in construction of small stores and rent costs, the spatial pattern of small stores does not typically adhere to the orientation of road network centrality."
3. "In Beijing, few densely distributed small stores were found in areas with excellent road network centrality and heavy traffic flow. Indeed, the distribution of small stores was relatively balanced, showing a multi-center spatial pattern."
4. "Based on the above findings, the following policy implications are suggested for urban land and spatial planning to ensure the future supply security of food outlets."
5. "The development of urban food systems is not only a matter of food itself, but also involves a wide range of urban planning issues, including natural resources, transportation systems, economic development, social equity, etc."
6. "Solutions on how to redesign food systems to ensure sustainability and resilience have emerged based on the multiple innovative responses to the COVID-19 pandemic."

These excerpts suggest areas for future research and policy development, focusing on the impact of private car ownership on retail layouts, the flexibility and costs associated with small store constructions, the balanced distribution of small stores, policy implications for urban land and spatial planning, the broad scope of urban food system development, and innovative solutions for sustainability and resilience in food systems.
