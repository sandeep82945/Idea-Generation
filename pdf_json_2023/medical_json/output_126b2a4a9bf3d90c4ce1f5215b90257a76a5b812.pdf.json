    "abstractText": "Composite material uses ceramic reinforcement to add to the metal matrix to obtain higher material properties. Structural design is an important direction of composite research. The reinforcement distribution of the core-shell structure has the unique advantages of strong continuity and uniform stress distribution. In this paper, a method of preparing boron carbide (B4C)-coated titanium (Ti) powder particles by ball milling and preparing core-shell B4C-reinforced Ti matrix composites by Spark Plasma Sintering was proposed. It can be seen that B4C coated on the surface of the spherical Ti powder to form a shell structure, and B4C had a certain continuity. Through X-ray diffraction characterization, it was found that B4C reacted with Ti to form layered phases of titanium boride (TiB) and titanium carbide (TiC). The compressive strength of the composite reached 1529.1 MPa, while maintaining a compressive strain rate of 5%. At the same time, conductivity and thermal conductivity were also characterized. The preparation process of the core-shell structure composites proposed in this paper has high feasibility and universality, and it is expected to be applied to other ceramic reinforcements. This result provides a reference for the design, preparation and performance research of core-shell composite materials.",

            "text": "Compounding is an important material design method, which uses ceramic (such as SiC, B4C, AlN, Si3N4, etc.) reinforcement to compound with a metal matrix to obtain higher material properties [1\u20133]. B4C is an ideal reinforcement with a light weight, high hardness and high elastic modulus [4,5]. It is used in metal matrix composites to greatly improve the mechanical properties. Based on the excellent properties of B4C, high-strength and highwear resistant composites have been developed and applied in the military, automotive and nuclear industries [6,7]. The reinforcement of traditional B4C/metal composites is mainly B4C particles (B4Cp). Researchers have carried out structural design research on B4Cp/Al and B4Cp/Ti matrix composites by adjusting the volume fraction, morphology and dispersion of B4C. Luo and Zhang et al. [8,9] found that increasing the B4Cp content could effectively improve\nMaterials 2023, 16, 1166. https://doi.org/10.3390/ma16031166 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/materials\nMaterials 2023, 16, 1166 2 of 10\nthe properties, but when the mass fraction was 27.5%, B4Cp agglomerated significantly, resulting in no further improvement in strength. Wu et al. [10] found that when the volume fraction was fixed, the smaller the B4Cp diameter, the higher the strength. Small-size B4Cp can effectively lead to larger values in strain gradient strengthening as well as CTE mismatch strengthening. Zhang et al. [11] prepared B4Cp/TiAl composites with different mass fractions. It was found that the flexural strength and fracture toughness of 20 wt.% B4Cp/TiAl were significantly improved compared with 10 wt.%. Selvakumar et al. [12] prepared 10 wt.% B4Cp/Ti6Al4V composites and found that the hardness of the composites increased with the increase of the ball milling time. Chen et al. [13] prepared 30 wt.% B4Cp/6061Al composites by hot pressing-extrusion-rolling. The high-volume fraction B4Cp was uniformly dispersed, and the tensile strength of the composite reached 265 MPa. B4C/Ti composites were prepared by a laser engineered net-shaping process by Nartu et al. [14], and the microscopic process of TiB and TiC formed by the reaction of B4C and Ti was studied and analyzed. A new study found that the powder with a core-shell structure has unique performance characteristics when sintered. The shell structure is connected into a network after sintering, which can effectively transfer the load and exert excellent mechanical properties. Yang et al. [15\u201317] oxidized Ti6Al4V titanium alloy powder at a high temperature to prepare a core-shell structure with the oxide of Ti6Al4V as the core and titanium as the shell. The titanium alloy powder with the core-shell structure was sintered into titanium matrix composites by spark plasma sintering. It was found that this structure has good oxidation resistance and high temperature stability. Li et al. [18] adsorbed B4C on the surface of spherical Ti powder to prepare Ti-B4C particles with a core-shell structure, and then reinforced 2024Al alloy. It was found that the yield strength of 10 wt.% Ti-B4C/2024Al composites increased by 37.2% and the elongation increased by 6.3%. The excellent performance was attributed to the combined effect of the Ti particles, B4C particles and in situ TiAl3 phase. Zygula et al. [19] used B4C to react with \u03b2-Ti alloy in situ to form TiB and TiC, and clarified the diffusion and reaction behavior of alloying elements. Jiang et al. [20] studied the reaction process of B4C and Ti during SPS reaction. The products were mainly TiC, and a small amount of TiB and TiB2. However, the current research on B4C/Ti composites is mostly focused on particle-reinforced metal matrix composites. The distribution of B4C is dispersed, and there is no preparation method for core-shell B4C/Ti composites. Furthermore, the effect of the shell-like distribution of B4C on the properties of composites is not clear. In this paper, Ti powder was used as the core and granular B4C as the shell. The research on the preparation of composite materials with core-shell Ti-B4C powder was carried out. The dispersion and preparation processes were optimized to guide the preparation of core-shell structural materials. The particularity of the core-shell structure and its unique mechanical properties were studied."

Before the collection of the diffraction patterns, the tested powder was evenly and randomly laid on the glass test platform, and the surface of the tested composite block was sandpapered and cleaned with an acetone solution.

It can be seen that the main component of the spherical particles was the Ti element, and a small amount of B and C elements were distributed on the surface, corresponding to the B4C particles added by ball milling. It can be seen that B4C particles were dispersed on the surface of the Ti powder after ball milling, forming the microstructure of B4C-coated Ti.

The interfacial reaction between B4C and Ti occurred, and a small amount of B4C d comp sed to form TiB and TiC, as shown in XRD (Figure 8). The needle-like TiB and TiC phase was distributed from the surface of Ti particles to the inside of the Ti particles. The B and C atoms provided by B4C were diffused from the core-shell structure shell to the core, thus forming a stagger d lam llar reinf cement inside the core-shell structure unit, and the results are shown in Figure 7.\n3.3. Mechanical and Functional Properties of Ti-B4C Composites The ability of a material to withstand axial static pressure at room temperature re-\nflects the ability of the material to resist deformation during application, which depends on the type of reinforcement, interfacial bond strength, reinforcement distribution pattern and reinforcement content of the core-shell composite.\nFigure 9 demonstrates the compressive stress\u2013strain curves of the three core-shell structure composites B4C/Ti. It can be seen that the plastic deformation phase was not obvious in the stress\u2013strain curves of the three composites, which proves that the introduction of a large number of brittle reinforcements significantly increases the brittleness of the composites. For the B4C/Ti composites, the interfacial reaction between B4C and Ti produced TiB and TiC, forming a better interfacial bond. The good interfacial bonding strength resulted in the B4C/Ti core-shell structure composite with a compressive strength of 1529.1 MPa. Compared to the compressive strength of the Ti matrix, the yield strength of all three composites was significantly improved. Typically, the B4C/Ti composite has a 3.8-times improvement in the yield strength, as shown in Table 1."

            "text": "In this paper, Ti-B4C core-shell structure composites were prepared by ball milling and SPS. The mechanical properties, electrical conductivity and thermal conductivity of the composites were studied. B4C reacts with Ti to form TiB and TiC, and obvious pores and defects are observed in the composites. The compressive strength of core-shell B4C/Ti composites is up to 1529.1 MPa, which, compared with the Ti matrix, has a substantial increase, while the material maintains a compressive strain of 5%. This result has reference significance for the preparation of core-shell B4C/Ti composites.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, Z.X., B.J., P.W.
