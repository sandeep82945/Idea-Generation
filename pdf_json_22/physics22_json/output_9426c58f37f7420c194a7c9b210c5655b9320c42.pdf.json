Interestingly, the magnon/photon interaction is accompanied by a phase factor which can usually be neglected. However, under the rotating wave approximation, if two magnon modes simultaneously couple with two cavity resonances, this phase cannot be ignored as it changes the physics of the system. We consider two such systems, each differing by the sign of one of the magnon/photon coupling strengths. This simple difference, originating from the various coupling phases in the system, is shown to preserve, or destroy, two potential applications of hybrid photon/magnon systems, namely dark mode memories and cavity-mediated coupling. The observable consequences of the coupling phase in this system is akin to the manifestation of a discrete Pancharatnam\u2013Berry phase, which may be useful for quantum information processing.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nMagnons are quasi-particles associated with the collective excitation of spins in magnetic materials. Magnons in ferrimagnetic insulators such as Yttrium-Iron-Garnet (YIG) are promising for information transduction, due to their ability to couple to a plethora of systems, such as mechanical resonators or optical and microwave photonic modes [1, 2]. The emerging field of cavity magnonics focuses on the photon/magnon interaction confined within cavities at microwave or optical frequencies [3\u20135]. In the microwave domain, strong and ultra-strong coherent coupling have been demonstrated [6\u201310], with the latter even reachable at room temperature [11].\nOwing to this flexibility, indirect coupling of two noninteracting systems by an auxiliary mode has been investigated in [12\u201318]. For instance, two macroscopically distant magnetic samples in a cavity can indirectly couple by using the cavity photons as a bridge [15\u201321]. Notably, in this configuration some eigenmodes are \u201cdark\u201d, in the sense that they do not lead to an experimental signature when probing the system. This dark mode physics can be used to create dark mode gradient memories as experimentally demonstrated in Zhang et al.. Another example of cavity-mediated coupling is the coupling of a magnon with a superconducting qubit, again mediated by a common cavity mode [22, 23]. This versatile configuration motivated studies of quantum magnonics [24], with proposals for single-magnon sources [25, 26], multi-magnon\n\u2217 alan.gardin@adelaide.edu.au\nblockade [27], single-shot detection of a single magnon [28] and quantum sensing of magnons [29].\nThese applications rely on the coupling between microwave photons and magnons, which physically originates from the Zeeman coupling between the spins in the ferrimagnetic material and the cavity\u2019s RF magnetic field [30]. Adopting a quantum formalism to describe this coupling allows for the precise computation of the coupling strength based on microscopic parameters and the cavity geometry [31]. Interestingly, the magnon/photon coupling term resulting from the Zeeman coupling term is accompanied by a phase factor. To the authors\u2019 knowledge, this phase has never been discussed explicitly in the literature, probably due to its inconspicuous nature in the systems considered so far.\nThe main contribution of this paper is to highlight how the coupling phases can become relevant in systems composed of several magnon and cavity modes. To that effect, we begin by explaining the origin of the coupling phase between a microwave photon and a magnon in section II. In section III, we introduce a hybrid system composed of two YIG spheres, each coupling to two magnetic eigenmodes of a microwave cavity. We show that the various magnon/photon coupling phases in such a system lead to an observable quantity \u03b8 parametrising the Hamiltonian. To illustrate the impact of the physical phase \u03b8, we study the physics of such a system in section IV, and find that both cavity-mediated coupling and dark mode physics are \u03b8-dependent.\nar X\niv :2\n21 2.\n05 38\n9v 1\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n1 1\nD ec\n2 02\n2\n2"

            "text": "In this section, we consider the interaction between one YIG sphere and one magnetic eigenmode of a microwave cavity. The geometry of the cavity fixes the resonance frequency \u03c9c/2\u03c0 of the magnetic mode H. These two quantities can be obtained by solving Maxwell\u2019s equations, for instance using an electromagnetic finite-element modelling software such as COMSOL Multiphysics\u00ae.\nThe lowest-order magnetostatic mode in the YIG sphere (the Kittel mode, k = 0) corresponds to a collective precession of the spins, which can be described using a macroscopic spin [32, 33]. Whilst higher-order standing wave modes (for k 6= 0) exist [34], we focus on the fundamental uniform mode in this work. For a spherical YIG sample, the ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) frequency \u03c9m/2\u03c0 can be tuned by an applied static magnetic field H0 = H0z\u0302 as \u03c9m = \u03b3|H0|, with \u03b3 the gyromagnetic ratio.\nAfter quantisation of the electromagnetic field, the cavity mode takes the form of a quantised harmonic oscillator ~\u03c9cc\u2020c, described using bosonic annihilation and creation operators c and c\u2020 respectively. Provided the number of magnons is negligible compared to the number of spins in the YIG, we can describe the magnon by a bosonic annihilation operator m after a HolsteinPrimakoff transformation [35], leading to a harmonic oscillator for the magnon mode [34]. The resulting free Hamiltonian (i.e. without interactions) is the sum of two quantised harmonic oscillators\nHfree = ~\u03c9cc\u2020c+ ~\u03c9mm\u2020m, (1)\ndescribing the cavity and magnon mode respectively. Note that these operators commute.\nB. Interaction term\nThe magnetic mode in the cavity, H, couples to the macrospin of the YIG sphere by a Zeeman interaction. Assuming the cavity mode H has no z dependence (for instance by considering a re-entrant cavity [30, 31, 36, 37]), the interaction term reads (details in appendix A)\nHI = ~gei\u03d5 ( c+ c\u2020 ) m\u2020 + h.c, (2)\nwhere the coupling strength g/2\u03c0 > 0 and coupling phase \u03d5 > 0 are real numbers, and h.c denotes the omitted hermitian conjugate terms. The coupling strength has the well-known expression [30, 31]\ng 2\u03c0 = \u03b7 \u221a \u03c9c \u03b3 4\u03c0\n\u221a \u00b5\ngL\u00b5B \u00b50~ns (3)\nwhere \u00b5B is the Bohr magneton, \u00b5 = 5\u00b5B the magnetic moment of YIG, gL = 2 the Lande\u0301 g-factor, \u00b50 the magnetic permeability of vacuum, ns = 4.22\u00d7 1027 m\u22123 the\nspin density of YIG, and the so-called form-factor\n\u03b7 =\n\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a\u221a (\u222b Vm H \u00b7 x\u0302 d3r )2 + (\u222b Vm H \u00b7 y\u0302 d3r )2\nVm \u222b Vc |H|2 d3r\n, (4)\nwith Vc the volume of the cavity and Vm the volume of the magnetic sample. On the other hand, the coupling phase \u03d5 reads\n\u03d5 = arg H\u0303, (5)\nwhere\nH\u0303 =\n\u222b\nVm\nH \u00b7 x\u0302 d3r + i \u222b\nVm\nH \u00b7 y\u0302 d3r . (6)\nFrom the definition of H\u0303, we see that the coupling phase depends on the orientation of the cavity\u2019s magnetic mode H traversing the magnetic sample.\nFor moderate values of the coupling strength g/2\u03c0, we can perform the rotating wave approximation (RWA) and neglect the counter-rotating terms cm+ c\u2020m\u2020 in eq. (2), so that the interaction simplifies to\nHI = ~gei\u03d5cm\u2020 + h.c, (7)\nwhich is valid in the strong coupling regime (g/\u03c9c < 0.1), but not in the ultrastrong coupling regime (g/\u03c9c > 0.1) [11]. We refer the reader to [38\u201340] for details about the ultrastrong coupling regime and the applicability of the RWA. In the remainder of this paper, we will always apply the RWA, and consider eq. (7) instead of eq. (2).\nTo conclude this section, we would like to mention that the coupling phase \u03d5 is fundamentally different from the phase factor used to model dissipative couplings [41]. Indeed, the magnon/photon dissipative coupling can be modelled as\nHI,dissipative = ~J(cm\u2020 + ei\u03c6c\u2020m), (8)\nwhere J and \u03c6 are constants. We notice that this term is not hermitian, contrary to eq. (7). As a result, a dissipatively coupled system can have complex eigenvalues, which are at the origin of energy level attraction in the spectrum. Conversely, a hermitian system guarantees real eigenvalues, and the coupling manifests as the standard level repulsion instead, or in other words an anti-crossing in the spectrum."

            "text": "The previous section highlights the presence of a coupling phase \u03d5 for each magnon/photon coupling term. In this section, we consider a system under the rotating wave approximation composed of two identical YIG spheres, each coupling to two magnetic eigenmodes of the cavity. The free Hamiltonian of the previous section is naturally generalised to\nHfree = ~\u03c9c,0c\u20200c0+~\u03c9c,1c \u2020 1c1+~\u03c9m,0m \u2020 0m0+~\u03c9m,1m \u2020 1m1, (9) where the ck describe the two magnetic eigenmodes of the cavity, and mk the two magnon modes associated with each YIG sphere. Again, the operators ck and mk all commute with each other, as they describe independent harmonic oscillators. We introduce the notations \u03c9o and \u03b4o for each operator o \u2208 {c,m} as\n\u03c9o = \u03c9o,0 + \u03c9o,1\n2 , \u03b4o = \u03c9o,1 \u2212 \u03c9o,0 2 , (10)\nso that\n\u03c9o,0 = \u03c9o \u2212 \u03b4o, \u03c9o,1 = \u03c9o + \u03b4o. (11)\nThe microwave cavity design determines the two resonances of the cavity modes, and hence the detuning \u03b4c between them and the average cavity resonance \u03c9c. For the magnons, the applied magnetic field H0 tunes the average magnon frequency \u03c9m = \u03b3|H0|, whilst the magnon detuning \u03b4m can be created by a permanent magnet or a coil placed near the YIG spheres (such a setup was used in [21] for instance).\nAssuming that both magnon modes couple with the same coupling strength gk to the cavity mode ck, the interaction Hamiltonian under the RWA is generalised to\nHI = ~g0ei\u03d500c0m\u20200 + ~g0e i\u03d501c0m \u2020 1+\n~g1ei\u03d510c1m\u20200 + ~g1e i\u03d511c1m \u2020 1 + h.c.\n(12)\nThis interaction Hamiltonian can be simplified by focusing all the coupling phases into one term (see fig. 1) using unitary transformations (we recall some elementary properties of unitary transformations in appendix B). The\ntransformed interaction Hamiltonian is\nHI,\u03b8 = ~g0c0m\u20200 + ~g0c0m \u2020 1\n+ ~g1c1m\u20200 + ~g1e i\u03b8c1m \u2020 1 + h.c,\n(13)\nwith \u03b8 = \u03d511\u2212\u03d501\u2212(\u03d510 \u2212 \u03d500). The \u201cphysical phase\u201d \u03b8 is reminiscent of a discrete Pancharatnam\u2013Berry phase, a gauge-invariant geometrical phase factor originating from the existence of a local U(1) gauge degree of freedom for each state involved in a loop in some parameter space [42]. This U(1) gauge is nothing but a choice of phase, which in our system is the coupling phase located on the black lines of fig. 1. The various coupling phases are linked to each other through the circles, forming a loop \u2013 leading to an observable physical phase \u03b8.\nTo conclude this section, we note that most systems studied in the literature consists of single magnon/photon systems, or several magnon modes coupling to a single cavity mode. In particular, setups comprised of two magnon modes coupling to one cavity mode have attracted interest for indirect coupling and dark mode physics [15\u201317, 19\u201321], as well as the generation of entangled states [43\u201345]. In these cases, the coupling phases do not lead to a physical phase, as we show in appendix C. This is in stark contrast with the system proposed here.\nIV. INFLUENCE OF THE PHYSICAL PHASE\nWe now highlight the \u03b8-dependent physics of the system described in the previous section, i.e.\nH\u03b8 = Hfree +HI,\u03b8, (14)\n4 with Hfree and HI,\u03b8 given by eqs. (9) and (13). While \u03b8 could in principle take any value in [0, 2\u03c0], we will focus our analysis on \u03b8 = 0 and \u03b8 = \u03c0, differing only in the sign of the coupling strength of the last term."

Polaritons are hybridised light/matter states and, in the context of cavity magnonics, they are known as cavity magnonpolaritons (CMP) [3, 46]. Diagonalisation of the system allows one to find the frequencies of the polaritons, as well as their composition in terms of the cavity and magnon mode operators ck,mk. All the modes of the system being bosonic, diagonalisation can be achieved by writing H\u03b8 = ~v\u2020Av with v = ( c0, c1,m0,m1 )t (t indicates matrix transposition) and\nA =   \u03c9c,0 0 g0 g0 0 \u03c9c,1 g1 g1e \u2212i\u03b8\ng0 g1 \u03c9m,0 0 g0 g1e i\u03b8 0 \u03c9m,1\n .

Parameters are \u03c9c,0 = 4 GHz, \u03c9c,1 = 6 GHz and g0 = g1 = 0.03\u03c9c. The dashed line corresponds to \u03c9 = \u03c9m. The legend in (a) is common to (b), (c) and (d).\nwhile level crossing is indicative of the absence of coupling. This suggests that at \u03c9m = \u03c9c, the eigenmodes associated with \u03c91 and \u03c92 couple for \u03b8 = \u03c0, but do not for \u03b8 = 0.\nb. Analysis in the dispersive regime. To clarify this spectral feature, we consider the dispersive regime, where both magnons are assumed to be far detuned from both cavity modes. Defining the detuning \u2206kk\u2032 = \u03c9m,k\u2032 \u2212\u03c9c,k between the cavity mode ck and the magnon mode mk\u2032 , the dispersive limit corresponds to |\u2206kk\u2032 | gk for all k, k\u2032 \u2208 {0, 1}. Under this approximation, we can employ a Schrieffer-Wolff transformation to perform first-order\nperturbation theory in \u2223\u2223\u2223 gk\u2206kk\u2032 \u2223\u2223\u2223 1 (see appendix D). We find that the magnon modes being significantly detuned from the cavity modes, the photon/magnon couplings are negligible, and the cavity and magnon modes decouple from each other (see eq. (D5)). However, virtual photons still mediate a magnon/magnon interaction, which for \u03c9m = \u03c9c, is described by the effective Hamiltonian (again, see appendix D for details)\nH \u2032magnons = ~\u03c9\u2032m,0m \u2020 0m0 + ~\u03c9 \u2032 m,1m \u2020 1m1\n+ ~ ( G\u03b8m0m \u2020 1 + h.c ) ,\n(18)\n5 where the frequencies of the magnons are shifted due to the cavity modes as\n\u03c9\u2032m,k = \u03c9c + g20\n\u22060k + g21 \u22061k\n(19)\nand the indirect magnon-magnon coupling G\u03b8/2\u03c0 is\nG\u03b8 = \u03b4c \u03b42c \u2212 \u03b42m ( g20 \u2212 ei\u03b8g21 ) . (20)\nThe magnitude of G\u03b8 characterises the strength of the magnon-magnon coupling, and predicts level repulsion of the eigenmodes of eq. (18). However, for g0 = g1 and \u03b8 = 0, the magnons do not interact since G\u03b8 vanishes, leading to crossing of the energy levels.\nc. Cavity-mediated coupling. To verify our analysis, we numerically plotted \u03c91 and \u03c92 by diagonalising eq. (15) at \u03c9m = \u03c9c in fig. 4. We observe the crossing of the solid lines (corresponding to \u03b8 = 0), while the dots (\u03b8 = \u03c0) anti-cross. The situation changes if we set g0 6= g1 as shown in fig. 4, and now we observe level repulsion for both \u03b8 = 0 and \u03b8 = \u03c0.

At \u03c9m = \u03c9c, this is equivalent to imposing g0, g1 |\u03b4c \u2212 \u03b4m|, which the parameters employed in fig. 4 satisfy. Regardless of the values of g0 and g1, fig. 4 shows that the frequency gap between the eigenmodes of eq. (18) is minimal when \u03c9\u2032m,0 = \u03c9 \u2032 m,1, i.e \u03b4m = 0. The location of this minimum gap is given by \u03c9\u2032c = \u03c9c+ g20\u2212g21 \u03b4c due to the frequency shift of the magnon modes described by eq. (19).\nPhysically, eq. (20) highlights an interference effect between the magnon-magnon couplings contributed by each cavity mode. This interference can be constructive for \u03b8 = \u03c0, or destructive for \u03b8 = 0, and we always have |G\u03c0| > |G0|. In particular, if g0 = g1, the cavitymediated coupling between the magnons completely vanishes for \u03b8 = 0. We conclude that the case \u03b8 = 0 is always detrimental to indirectly couple two spatially distant magnons, while the case \u03b8 = \u03c0 is benificial. This conclusion highlights the importance of the physical phase \u03b8 for multimode cavity-mediated coupling applications."

The different interaction pathways between the modes are illustrated in fig. 7a.\nNotably, if \u03b4m = 0, H\u03b8 describes the interaction between four different modes, while for \u03b8 = 0 it separates into a 3-mode system {c0, c1,M0} and a one-mode system {M\u03c0}, and for \u03b8 = \u03c0 it separates into two two-mode systems {c0,M0} and {c1,M\u03c0}. In particular, for \u03b4m = 0 and \u03b8 = 0 (fig. 7b), we see that M\u03c0 does not couple to any other mode.\nb. Dark mode definition. The presence of such an uncoupled eigenmode is reminiscent of dark mode physics. Dark (bright) states are states that weakly (strongly) couple with the readout mechanism. Due to their weak coupling, these states benefit from an increased lifetime over their bright counterpart, and hence are interesting candidates for storing information. Dark and bright modes are defined similarly, but refer to the associated polaritonic mode in continuous variable systems.\n6 M\u03b8 M\u03b8+\u03c0 M0 M\u03c0 M0 M\u03c0 (a) 0 6 \u03b8 6 \u03c0 c0 c1 \u2212\u03b4m (b) \u03b8 = 0 c0 c1 \u2212\u03b4m (c) \u03b8 = \u03c0 c0 c1 \u2212\u03b4m g\u03030 g\u03030 g\u03031 g\u03031g\u03030| cos \u03b82 | g\u03030| sin \u03b82 | g\u03031\nFIG. 6: Schematic of the interactions present in H\u03b8 in the rotated magnon basis (see eqs. (22) and (23)) for (a) arbitrary \u03b8, (b) \u03b8 = 0, (c) \u03b8 = \u03c0. The black lines are labelled by the magnitude of the couplings, and the dotted black line represents the possibility of vanishing \u03b4m. Note that M0 = M2\u03c0.\nThe definition of a dark mode given above is dependent on the mechanism used to probe the system. Since here we are interested in photon/magnon hybridisation, we consider a detection based on a microwave transmission experiment mediated by photons. As a consequence, we expect that any eigenmodes coupling with cavity modes will indirectly couple to the readout medium, hence acquiring an experimental signature.\nThe input-output formalism [47] allows one to model this scenario. To illustrate our discussion of dark modes, we now consider the transmission through the cavity (S21 parameter), experimentally obtained by attaching a vector network analyser to the two ports of a cavity. The derivation of the input-output theory is rather lengthy, so we refer the reader to appendix E for more details. We consider that each cavity mode ck couples to a photonic bath with coupling rate \u221a \u03b3/2\u03c0 and we set \u03b3 = 5 MHz. We further introduce the intrinsic dissipation \u03ba = 1 MHz of the cavity (due to its finite quality factor) and magnon modes (Gilbert damping) through \u03c9\u0303o,k = \u03c9o,k\u2212i\u03ba. Other parameters are as in fig. 2. The numerical results are plotted in fig. 8.\nc. Dark mode physics. Given the definition of a dark mode given above, we conclude that for \u03b8 = 0, M\u03c0 is dark, since it is uncoupled to cavity modes. This is indeed what we observe in fig. 9a: comparing to the spectrum in fig. 2, the polaritonic frequency \u03c91/2\u03c0 associated with M\u03c0 does not give a maximum of transmission, unlike the other frequencies. This is in contrast with fig. 9c, in which all the polaritonic frequencies lead to maxima of transmissions. Indeed, for \u03b8 = \u03c0, M\u03c0 couples to c1. Hence, since all the eigenmodes for \u03b8 = \u03c0 couple to photons, we conclude that strictly speaking, there are no dark modes for \u03b8 = \u03c0.\nThese observations rely on both magnons modes having identical resonance frequencies, i.e. \u03b4m = 0. If this symmetry is broken by setting \u03b4m 6= 0, a new interaction pathway between M\u03c0 and M0 opens (see fig. 6), regardless of the value of \u03b8. Since M0 couples to the cavity modes, then M\u03c0 will also couple to the cavity modes through M0. As a consequence, we expect M\u03c0 to acquire an experimental signature if \u03b4m 6= 0. This theoretical\nFIG. 8: Numerical calculation of the microwave transmission through the system obtained using an input-output theory for H\u03b8 at different magnon detuning \u03b4m. See the main text for the parameters. In (a) we see that the spectral line associated to \u03c91 (see fig. 2) does not lead to a maximum of transmission, contrary to (b), (c) and (d). This shows that the eigenmode associated with \u03c91 is a dark mode.\nprediction is supported numerically by figs. 9b and 9d. We note that this phenomenon of the illumination of a dark mode by symmetry breaking was already discussed by [20] in the interaction picture.\nTo conclude this section, we comment on the presence of two types of anti-resonances. The first type corresponds to dark diagonal lines which follow the FMR of the YIG spheres. They are the result of destructive interference between the FMR and the RF magnetic mode of the cavity, as explained by [48]. The other type is due to destructive interference between the two cavity modes, and corresponds to the dark horizontal lines centred around \u03c9c = \u03c9c,0+\u03c9c,1 2 . These anti-resonances are uncoupled for \u03b8 = 0 (straight line for all \u03c9m), while for \u03b8 = \u03c0 an anti-crossing appears. This phenomenon can be explained by the fact that for \u03b8 = 0, both cavity modes couple to M0 with equal coupling strengths, while the situation is different for \u03b8 = \u03c0 (see fig. 6). Had we set g0 6= g1, the anti-resonance due to the cavity modes would have also coupled near the FMR for \u03b8 = 0."

            "heading": "V. CONCLUSION",
            "text": "To summarise our results, we showed that the interaction between a microwave photon and a magnon in a\n7 cavity is always associated with a coupling phase, which is different from that in dissipatively coupled systems. In most cases studied in the literature, this coupling phase can be omitted because of the simple topology of the interaction diagrams. Indeed, we traced the manifestation of the coupling phase to the presence of loops in the interaction diagrams (as illustrated by fig. 10), a phenomenon similar to a discrete Pancharatnam\u2013Berry phase. To illustrate that the physics was dependent on the coupling phase, we considered a model composed of two cavity modes and two magnon modes, parametrised by the physical phase \u03b8. For different values of \u03b8, we found different behaviours with respect to two potential applications of cavity magnonics: one case is advantageous for cavity-mediated coupling but cannot be used for dark mode memories (\u03b8 = \u03c0), and vice-versa for the other case (\u03b8 = 0). We note that while we showed results only for \u03b8 = 0 and \u03b8 = \u03c0, our analytical derivations were still parametrised by a general \u03b8, and hence apply to intermediate cases. In fact, values of \u03b8 between 0 and \u03c0 continuously interpolate between the results presented in this paper (see the cavity-mediated coupling strength of eq. (20) for example).\nOne could question whether there are simpler models in which there is a physical phase. In theory, any system in which there are n interactions between n bosonic modes, with one being a microwave photon/magnon interaction, leads to a physical phase. One such example was considered by Zhan et al., where two ferromagnetic bilayers couple to a common cavity mode, but can also directly couple together thanks to the interlayer exchange interaction. This results in a triangular-shaped interaction diagram, so that in principle, a physical phase should parametrise their Hamiltonian. However, it is unclear how the impact of the physical phase could be experimentally verified in such a system. First, achieving different coupling phases for each ferromagnetic bilayers is a challenging experimental task, since the two layers need to be close to each other but be penetrated by the same cavity mode with a different angle (see eq. (5)). Furthermore, as noted by the authors of Zhan et al., the experimental verification of their analysis requires smaller magnon damping rates than currently reported in experiments.\nInstead, the model introduced in section III should be experimentally accessible using re-entrant cavity designs. Indeed, previous experimental results demonstrated the tunability of the frequencies of the cavity modes, with values of the coupling strengths compatible with the RWA [31, 36, 37]. Placing two YIG spheres in a 3-post re-entrant cavity should allow to implement the two cases \u03b8 = 0 and \u03b8 = \u03c0 discussed here, and will be the subject of a separate investigation.\nThe engineering of cavities to achieve specific physical phases is an exciting research direction. The design of such cavities will consists in controlling the relative orientation of the magnetic modes traversing the magnetic samples, as described by eq. (5). Finally, we note that we considered only a rather simple model in which a physical\nphase manifests. For instance, considering an additional cavity mode would lead to the appearance of two physical phases, for which the physics is yet to explored. More generally, the existence of discrete Pancharatnam\u2013Berry phases in microwave cavity magnonics may find applications in quantum information processing."

The Hamiltonian is H = Hfree +HI with\nHfree = ~\u03c9cc\u2020c+ ~\u03c9m,0m\u20200m0 + ~\u03c9m,1m \u2020 1m1, (C5)\nHI = ~g0ei\u03d50cm\u20200 + ~g1e i\u03d51cm\u20201 + h.c, (C6)\nand is illustrated in figs. 11c and 11d.\nOne simple possibility to remove the coupling phases \u03d5i is to successively rotate mi using Umi = e \u2212i\u03d5im\u2020imi for i \u2208 {0, 1} (fig. 11c). While this is the simplest method, we could also rotate the cavity mode c (fig. 11d), for instance to remove \u03d50 using Uc = e i\u03d50c\n\u2020c, but then the coupling to the second magnon is also affected and reads ~g1ei(\u03d51\u2212\u03d50)cm\u20201 + h.c. Applying Um1 = e\u2212i(\u03d51\u2212\u03d50)m \u2020 1m1 removes the remaining phase.\nFormally, it appears that the coupling phases are again unimportant for the resulting physics. While the physics is unchanged, we would like to mention that the interpretation of the physics is: the rotated frame is not the laboratory frame. As an example, [20] studied the specific case of \u03d50 = \u03d51 = 0 and g0 = g1 = g, and found that M\u2212 =\nm0\u2212m1\u221a 2 was the only dark mode of the system. If\nwe were to consider g0 = \u2212g1 = g instead (obtained by applying U = e\u2212i\u03c0m \u2020 1m1 for instance), we would find that the dark mode is transformed to M+ = m0+m1\u221a\n2 in this\nframe. Still, the spectrum and other physical predictions of [20] would all hold.\n10"

            "text": "We note that the removal of the coupling phases in the previous examples was facilitated by the fact that the interaction diagrams had open ends: the rotation of the modes at the ends of the interaction chain would at most affect one edge. Having a closed loop, however, removes this freedom, resulting in an observable physical phase \u03b8. We believe the hybrid system introduced in section III is the simplest system with an interaction loop involving a magnon/photon interaction, which could be experimentally accessible."
