Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, Dublin, Ireland; Institute of Child Health, University College London, London; Department of Statistics, University of Oxford, Oxford 10.1136/archdischild-2022-rcpch.666 Aims Early-onset depression (<18 years) has a poor prognosis and results in long-term adverse outcomes including physical and mental co-morbidities, substance abuse, and decreased social and academic attainment. It is a major risk factor for suicide in adolescents, which is the third most common cause of death in this age group. Accumulating evidence suggests that adults with major depressive disorder or depressive symptoms have increased levels of pro-inflammatory markers compared to non-depressed adults. This low-grade inflammation is increasingly seen as a diagnostic and therapeutic target in a subset of depression. However, this association is less closely investigated in children and adolescents. Also, current literature on CRP levels (marker of inflammation) in depression is inconsistent and contradictory. We conducted a systematic review to determine the relationship between depression and CRP among children and adolescents, and whether the relationship is dose-dependent. Methods The study was conducted according to the PRISMA guidelines. Relevant literature was identified by searching the following electronic databases from inception through 16 March 2021: Embase, PsycInfo, PubMed, and Scopus. No language limitations were applied to the search. This yielded 1842 non-duplicate studies. Studies that included a measure of depression (DSM 4/5, ICD-10, and/or determined by standardized self-report and diagnostic assessments) and CRP (blood, serum, or saliva) in 5-25 year-olds were included. To minimize the risk of bias, all the articles were independently assessed by 2 reviewers against the eligibility criteria. Results A total of 43 studies with 85,435 participants were included. The mean age range of participants was 9-34 years. Sample sizes ranged between 35-13,006 participants. Twentynine studies (67.4%) reported a significant association between CRP levels and depression (17 cross-sectional, 12 longitudinal). In some of the studies, this association was only evident in specific sub-populations such as only in a certain gender, those with atypical depression, severe depression, high number of depressive symptoms, or CRP gene polymorphisOf the 43 studies included, 25 were cross-sectional studies and 18 were longitudinal studies with follow-up time ranging between 2.5 and 14 years. Findings from the longitudinal studies suggest that a bidirectional association may exist but results are inconsistent. Conclusion There may be a positive dose-dependent relationship between CRP levels and depression amongst children and adolescents, more notable in certain sub-groups. The directionality of this relationship is conflicting. 1027 IMPACT OF COVID-19 ON THE FREQUENCY OF CHILDREN AND YOUNG PEOPLE PRESENTING TO A SECONDARY CARE SETTING DUE TO MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS Maria Medeiros, Safiyyah Samad, Saji Alexander, Rebecca Irvine, Jessica Theile, Midhat Ahmed, Ross Davidson. Imperial College University; Chelsea and Westminster Hospital NHS Foundation Trust 10.1136/archdischild-2022-rcpch.667 Aims COVID-19 has impacted the lives of children and young people (CYP) through the effects of national lockdowns on education, social services and children and adolescent mental health services (CAMHS). Due to COVID-19, the number of CYP seeking help from such services has decreased. Since 2017, there has been a 6% increase in the number of CYP identified as having a probable mental disorder and those with mental health (MH) problems are more likely to state that lockdown made their life worse than those without. Aim Assess the trend of CYP mental health presentations and admissions to an acute paediatric service and the potential impact of COVID-19, as part of a service evaluation. Methods Presentations to PED from April-October 2019 (preCOVID) and April-October 2021 (during COVID) were analysed. Those who were admitted to the acute MH ward were identified. Data including demographics, presenting complaint, length of stay, past MH history/admissions, previous involvement with CAMHS and discharge destination were collected. Data from 2019 was compared to 2021 using Fisher \u0301s exact test and unpaired t-tests to establish significance. Results There was a 132% increase in the number of children presenting to PED from 2019 to 2021 with a MH related problem (table 1); the absolute number of admissions increased by 97%. Demographics were similar in 2019 and 2021. There was a significant increase in the mean length of admission from 4 days to 8.7 days in 2021 (p=0.037). There was a significant increase in the proportion of patients who were discharged home with a community CAMHS follow up (p=0.003). Fewer patients were admitted to psychiatric units in 2021 compared to 2019 (5% vs 21%). Overdose was the commonest cause of admission with a significant increase from 2019 to 2021 (p=0.037).

D ow nladed fom Abstract 1027 Table 11027 Table 1 Conclusion There was an increase in the number of CYP presenting to PED with MH crisis from 2019 to 2021. The number of children admitted to our acute paediatric ward in 2021 nearly doubled from 2019, suggesting a possible deterioration of CYP MH during the pandemic. This seems consistent with national data from 2020 following the first wave of COVID-19. Throughout 2019 and 2021, the majority of admitted patients were previously known to CAMHS, yet were still presenting to PED. This may reflect accessibility issues due to reduced capacity of community CAMHS as an indirect effect of the pandemic. Our findings highlight the concerning increase in admissions of CYP due to overdose since the start of COVID-19, reflecting the vulnerability and lack of support services for children in inner cities. Lastly, we have demonstrated an increase in the burden on acute paediatric wards, imposing logistical pressures on bed management, personnel, patient environment and cost. These effects warrant immediate, careful consideration in the context of public health as well as CAMHS provision in primary and secondary care. REFERENCES 1.
