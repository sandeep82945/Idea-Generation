Additionally, electric buses are becoming increasingly popular and could help further reduce emissions from transportation [110, 124]. vi. conclusion and suggestions The energy mix immensely impacts economic sustainability by offering environmental protection and ecological stability. The motivation of the study is to gauge the nexus of openness-led energy transition in BRI nations for the period 2005–2021. The study implemented several economic tools, especially CS-ARDL and NARDL, for documenting the elasticities of openness, that is, financial openness, trade openness and economic openness in energy transition, which is measured by renewable energy consumption (REC), non-renewable energy consumption (NREC), and fossil energy consumption, respectively. The key study findings are as follows:
The preliminary assessment that is, SHT, CSD, and panel unit root test, ascertain the het-
erogeneity in the research units and share common dynamic properties. Variables are integrated after the first difference operation. Long-run cointegration is disclosed by executing the panel cointegration test following [125–127]. The coefficients extracted from CS-ARDL in the study revealed a catalyst role of openness in the energy mix, especially the inclusion of clean energy both in the long run and short. The asymmetric evaluation revealed that positive negative shocks in openness lead to a positive association with energy consumption. Moreover, the asymmetric association was also exposed through the execution of a standard Wald test. The study findings show that FO, TO, and GCF are critical in energy sustainability in BRI nations. It implies that clean energy inclusion in the energy mix might be amplified, and energy sustainability may be ensured. The energy transition of Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) nations is significantly affected by financial, trade, and domestic capital adequecy. The success of sustainable energy policies is determined by several factors, which play a crucial role in countries participating in BRI projects. Economies that are open financially have the potential to attract more foreign investment to develop renewable energy. Additionally, trade openness can provide access to clean technology from other countries. Economically open nations have the advantage of being able to prioritize investments toward cleaner sources of energy at a faster pace compared to closed economies. This is because of their dynamic markets. However, countries that are part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and do not have sufficient financial or trade openness may face difficulties in adopting sustainable technologies because of technologies unable to integrate with international markets effectively. In addition, developing countries participating in BRI initiatives may face challenges in pursuing green technology solutions without implementing economic liberalization policies and reforms promoting diversified industries, such as renewable energies like solar or hydropower plants. It is important to prioritize creating an environment that promotes financial and trade cooperation among participating states to achieve successful outcomes to mitigate climate change. This will also protect the welfare of future generations by providing cleaner air quality and spurring technological advancements through innovative investments focused on promoting environmental protection across all sectors concerned with sustainability issues facing humanity today. Drawing from the research study’s results, several recommendations can be made to foster
sustainable energy transitions in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) area. First, To improve the success of clean energy projects, policymakers should prioritize
enhancing financial access and support mechanisms. This may entail the development of specialized funding platforms, the establishment of green investment banks, and the provision of incentives to financial institutions for investing in renewable energy initiatives. Furthermore,

promoting financial literacy and capacity-building programs for clean energy financing can augment the efficacy of financial assistance. Second, The enhancement of trade cooperation in clean energy is recommended. Governments are advised to promote and simplify the transfer of renewable energy technologies, products, and services between nations involved in the Belt and Road Initiative. This objective can be attained by eliminating trade barriers, aligning standards and regulations, and fostering research and development partnerships. International trade agreements that specifically address clean energy and climate-friendly technologies have the potential to promote a thriving clean energy market in the BRI region. Third, Fostering education and research in clean energy fields should be prioritized by policymakers in terms of investment. This may entail the establishment of research centers and universities exclusively dedicated to renewable energy studies, providing scholarships and grants for students pursuing clean energy-related degrees, and facilitating collaborative research projects between universities and industry. Advocating for interdisciplinary education programs integrating engineering, business, and policy can yield a proficient workforce that propels innovation in the clean energy industry. Fourth, Implementing supportive policies and regulations by governments is crucial in promoting the adoption and investment of clean energy. This may encompass feed-in tariffs, tax incentives, and carbon pricing mechanisms that furnish monetary incentives for clean energy initiatives. A well-defined and consistent regulatory framework that minimizes bureaucratic obstacles and offers enduring predictability has the potential to entice both domestic and foreign investments in the clean energy industry. Fifth, To promote sustainable urbanization, it is recommended that policies be formulated to effectively tackle the challenges arising from the swift urbanization in the BRI region, which may entail advocating for energy-efficient building design and construction, providing incentives for integrating renewable energy into urban infrastructure and establishing sustainable transportation systems. Strategic planning for compact and well-connected cities can decrease energy consumption and encourage the implementation of sustainable energy alternatives. Six, To bolster financial development, policymakers should prioritize improving financial systems’ effectiveness, lucidity, and steadiness in the BRI region. The objectives mentioned above can be attained by implementing reforms that encourage responsible lending practices, enhance the accessibility of financial services, and establish regulatory frameworks that foster sustainable financing.
