In-Depth Structural Analysis of MCM7-Ligand Complexes: Conducting further in-depth structural and functional studies on the MCM7-ligand complexes identified as having high affinity and specificity, especially ergocalciferol. This could involve high-resolution X-ray crystallography or cryo-electron microscopy to elucidate the precise molecular interactions and conformational changes in the MCM7 protein upon ligand binding. Understanding these interactions at a molecular level could provide insights into how these complexes inhibit MCM7 activity and cancer progression.

Exploration of Combination Therapies: Investigating the synergistic effects of the identified MCM7 inhibitors with current cancer treatments. This research could focus on assessing the efficacy of combination therapies involving ergocalciferol, cholecalciferol, ergosterol, and menaquinone with existing chemotherapeutic agents or radiation therapy. The goal would be to determine if these combinations could enhance cancer cell killing, reduce drug resistance, or minimize side effects associated with traditional cancer treatments.

In Vivo Efficacy and Toxicity Studies: Conducting comprehensive in vivo studies to assess the efficacy, safety, and toxicity profiles of the identified MCM7 inhibitors in animal models of cancer. These studies would provide crucial data on the therapeutic potential of these compounds, including their pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, optimal dosing strategies, and potential side effects or toxicities in a whole organism context.

Screening of Natural and Synthetic Compound Libraries: Expanding the search for MCM7 inhibitors beyond the compounds tested in this study by screening large libraries of natural and synthetic compounds using high-throughput screening methods. This could identify new compounds with higher potency, specificity, and better pharmacological profiles as MCM7 inhibitors. Combining these screening efforts with computational drug design and machine learning algorithms could accelerate the discovery of novel therapeutic agents.

Elucidation of the Role of MCM7 in Cancer Cell Metabolism and Immune Evasion: Investigating the broader role of MCM7 in cancer biology, including its impact on cancer cell metabolism and immune system evasion. Understanding how MCM7 overexpression alters cancer cell metabolic pathways and the tumor microenvironment could reveal new therapeutic targets and strategies for sensitizing cancer cells to immune surveillance and destruction. This research could also explore how MCM7 inhibitors affect these processes and their potential to enhance the effectiveness of immunotherapies.
