INTRODUCTION\nQuantum master equations (QMEs) play a key role in the study of open quantum systems, describing the time evolution of the reduced density operator of a system coupled to thermal baths. Assuming weak systembath coupling, QMEs are typically obtained starting from the unitary evolution of the full system plus baths, by making the Born-Markov approximation and tracing over environmental degrees of freedom1. The resulting Redfield equation may be used in its own right, or serve as a jumping off point for a variety of further approximations leading to quantum master equations with differing features2\u20135.\nRedfield equations are well known not to be of GoriniKossakowski-Lindblad-Sudarshan (GKLS) form6,7, and thus, in general, fail to preserve the positivity of the reduced density operator8\u201310. The secular approximation, which ignores oscillating terms in the dissipative part of the master equation, is often employed to avoid this pitfall8,11. Indeed, when neglecting all oscillating terms, one obtains master equations that have a number of advantageous properties with regards to thermodynamics\u2014 but also neglect any impact that eigenstate coherences can have on population evolution, and vice-versa. This approximation is therefore invalid for systems with eigenstates close in energy, in which case some terms in the Redfield equation oscillate on timescales that rival the timescales for the dynamics of interest2.\nRecently, a new form of quantum master equation, termed the \u201cUnified\u201d QME (UQME), has been developed\nto describe, with greater accuracy than the fully Secular master equation, open quantum systems with nearly degenerate energy levels2. It does so, in part, by making the secular approximation only with respect to pairs of levels separated by an amount of energy substantially greater than that characterizing the system-bath interactions. For transitions associated with these pairs, the oscillating terms in the Redfield equation oscillate fast enough to be neglected. The impact on the dynamics of relevant coherences\u2013those between levels close in energy\u2013 is captured by the UQME. This master equation has also been shown to be of GKLS form, and thus preserves the positivity of the system\u2019s reduced density operator, as desired2.\nIn addition to the preservation of positivity, one desirable property of quantum master equation descriptions is thermodynamic consistency: namely, that the equations give rise to dynamics that satisfy the laws of thermodynamics. More specifically, QMEs should satisfy quantum fluctuation theorems. These theorems serve as a sufficient condition for the Second Law of Thermodynamics at the level of averages12\u201316, as well as familiar results including the Green-Kubo relation between steady-state current fluctuations and conductance in the linear response regime13.\nWith ongoing advances in quantum thermodynamics, questions over the consistency and accuracy of QMEs are gaining much attention: To realize quantum thermal machines that build on the interplay between coherent and thermal effects (see e.g., proposals17\u201335), it is imperative to develop methods that are both thermodynamically\n2 consistent, and account for the behavior of quantum coherences. Some of the examined aspects of QME concern their positivity2,3,36\u201340, the \u201cright\u201d basis41\u201348, and modifications to the weak coupling QME49\u201353 for improving consistency and accuracy, as well as extensions beyond weak coupling and Markovianity, see e.g.,4,54\u201365. This paper is focused on verifying that the UQME, which accounts for coherences, fulfills the heat exchange fluctuation theorem. In the language of full counting statistics, the steady state fluctuation symmetry for entropy production can be written in terms of the moment generating function, Z(\u03c7, t), a function of a counting field \u03c7, whose derivatives evaluated at \u03c7 = 0 give the higher order moments of the heat currents through the system at all times15,66. In the long time limit, provided the Hamiltonian has no explicit time-dependence, one may consider also the steadystate scaled cumulant generating function, G(\u03c7), whose derivatives are instead the heat current cumulants. The fluctuation symmetry for steady-state heat transport, in the absence of particle transport, states that12,66,\nG(\u03c7) = G(\u2212\u03c7\u2212 i\u03b2), (1)\nwhere \u03b2 is a vector of inverse temperatures of the thermal baths with which the system exchanges energy. Below we refer in short to Eq. (1) as the \u201cfluctuation symmetry\u201d. Proving this symmetry for the UQME, as a consequence of a more general symmetry of the moment generating function, and quantifying its violation (and thus the breakdown of transport relationships) under the Redfield QME is the main focus of this work. The heat exchange fluctuation symmetry has been shown to hold for the fully Secular quantum master equation66, including in the case where exact degeneracies are present in the system. In this case, coherences persist between degenerate levels at steady state, and their effect must be included in the dynamics67. Recent work has also established general conditions for thermodynamic consistency of quantum master equations68. In what follows, we will show that the UQME, in addition to being of GKLS form and preserving positivity, satisfies the heat exchange fluctuation symmetry. We will do so using analytic arguments, and demonstrate these results via numerical simulations pertaining to the so-called \u201cV\u201d model, a simple model consisting of one lower energy level coupled via interactions with bosonic thermal reservoirs to two excited states, as shown in Fig. 1. The excited states are at substantially higher energy than the ground state, but are close enough in energy to one another that coherences between them cannot be ignored. In fact, the V system has been shown to exhibit long-lived transient coherences when coupled to a single reservoir69\u201372, as well as coherences that persist in nonequilibrium steady states23\u201325,73\u201376. Coherences in this model have a significant effect on the population dynamics and the steady-state transport behavior as governed by quantum master equations23\u201325\nThus, the UQME is a good candidate for describing,\naccurately and in a thermodynamically consistent manner, the dynamics and steady-state behavior of level populations and coherences in the V system and similar models. It is also effective in describing the statistics of heat currents such systems may facilitate when coupled to multiple baths at different temperatures25. This paper is organized as follows. In Sec. II we review the Unified QME and discuss the conditions for its validity. In Sec. III we implement full counting statistics for the UQME by deriving a version of the master equation that is \u201cdressed\u201d with a counting field. From this equation we are able to derive the cumulant generating function (CGF) for the statistics of heat currents. We go on to prove, based on a symmetry of the counting fielddependent generator of time translations, that the CGF obtained with the UQME satisfies the heat exchange fluctuation symmetry. In Sec. IV we focus on the specific example of a V system facilitating heat transport between two bosonic reservoirs at different temperatures, demonstrating that fluctuation symmetry is satisfied when the dynamics are modelled by the UQME, and violated when the Redfield equation is used instead. We go on to compare the predictions the two equations make for the mean and variance of the heat current at steady state by examining transport symmetries including the Green-Kubo relation, as well as the Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation (TUR). We summarize our results and conclude in Sec. V."

            "text": "The derivation of the Unified quantum master equation is found in Ref.2 and summarized here for completeness. An open system interacting with heat baths is generally described by a Hamiltonian of the form,\nH = HS +HB + V, (2)\nwhere HS is the Hamiltonian of the system, taken to have a discrete spectrum of eigenvalues, {Ea}, the differences between which comprise the set of all Bohr frequencies, \u03c9ab = Ea \u2212 Eb (here and in what follows, we take ~ = kB = 1). The system interacts with some number of baths labelled by j, each with its own free Hamiltonian HB,j. All baths are independent of one another and do not interact directly, so HB = \u2211\nj HB,j . Finally, the interaction Hamiltonian has a contribution from each bath j which can be written as a sum over direct products of operators, labelled by \u00b5, acting on the system and relevant bath Hilbert spaces:\nV = \u2211\nj\nVj = \u2211\nj,\u00b5\nSj\u00b5 \u2297 Bj\u00b5 = \u2211\n\u03b1\nS\u03b1 \u2297B\u03b1. (3)\nHere, Sj\u00b5 is an operator of the system which couples to the jth bath through the bath operator Bj\u00b5; j labels the bath and \u00b5 labels the (potentially many) contributions to the interaction with an individual bath. In the last\n3 member of the equality (3), the index \u03b1 represents the pair of indices j\u00b5. As is common in quantum master equation derivations, the initial state of the total system plus baths is taken to be a direct product \u03c10 \u2297 \u220f\nj \u03c1\u0304j , where \u03c10 is the initial reduced density operator of the system, and \u03c1\u0304j is a stationary state with respect to the bath Hamiltonian HB,j. We will take \u03c1\u0304j to be a Gibbs\u2019 state characterized by the temperature Tj of the associated bath. The total density operator is understood to evolve unitarily with respect to the full Hamiltonian H . The reduced system density operator is then obtained by tracing over all bath degrees of freedom,\n\u03c1(t) = TrB[\u03c1tot(t)] = TrB [ e\u2212iHt(\u03c10 \u2297 \u220f\nj\n\u03c1\u0304j)e iHt\n]\n. (4)\nThe standard approach towards obtaining a time-local equation for the time derivative of \u03c1(t) consists of making the Born and Markov approximations1. The former states that the system-bath state remains a product state at all times up to second order in the interaction strength. The latter is the approximation that the baths are \u201cmemory-less\u201d, on account of the fact that the bath correlation timescale is significantly faster than the timescale for the dynamics of interest. Thus, knowledge of the current state of the system is sufficient to determine its time derivative. The resulting equation is the Redfield quantum master equation.

(7)\nFIG. 1. Schematic diagram of the \u201cV Model\u201d: a sole ground state couples to two nearly degenerate excited states. In the situation depicted, this coupling is realized via interactions with a hot (L) and cold (R) bath. The splitting \u03bd separates between levels |1\u3009 and |3\u3009; levels |2\u3009 and |3\u3009 are splitted by energy \u2206 \u226a \u03bd. The |1\u3009 \u2194 |3\u3009 transition induced by the R bath is scaled by a real-valued factor of \u03b1 in the interaction Hamiltonian. All matrix elements relevant to the dynamics of the reduced density matrix \u03c1 are depicted with their associated energy levels (or pairs of energy levels). The off-diagonal elements depicted couple to the diagonal elements and generally do not vanish at steady state under evolution by the Unified quantum master equation.\nIn general, differing values of \u03c9 and \u03c9\u2032 allow the matrix \u03b3\u03b1\u03b2(\u03c9, \u03c9\n\u2032) not to be positive semidefinite. Thus, the Redfield equation is not of GKLS form and may not preserve positivity of the reduced density operator2,8,11. The full secular approximation resolves this issue by neglecting all terms in the summation of Eq. (5) for which \u03c9 6= \u03c9\u2032. It is commonly argued that the oscillatory factor in these terms render their contirbution to the dynamics negligible over the timescales of interest1,5. However, this argument fails for systems with nearly degenerate energy levels2,8. More precisely, oscillatory terms cannot be neglected when they involve pairs of Bohr frequencies whose separation rivals the system-bath interaction energy scale in magnitude. This includes the so-called \u201cV\u201d system depicted in Fig. 1: two excited states, both separated from the ground state approximately by energy \u03bd, are separated from each other only by the small splitting \u2206 \u226a \u03bd. For this system, eigenstate coherences between the two excited states, quantified by the density matrix elements \u03c123(t) and \u03c132(t), are expected to play a significant role in the overall dynamics once \u2206 \u2264 \u03b3(\u03bd), with \u03b3(\u03bd) defined above Eq. (9). Thus, to avoid the pitfalls of the Redfield equation without making the full secular approximation, we turn to the Unified quantum master equation. Its derivation begins with the identification of \u201cclusters\u201d of nearly degenerate states of the system. The system Hamiltonian may then be represented as\nHS = H (0) S + \u03b4HS . (8)\nClusters of nearly degenerate levels appear in H (0) S as exactly degenerate, while \u03b4HS expresses only the small\n4 differences in energies within each cluster. A smaller set of Bohr frequencies, \u03c9\u0304, can be identified for H (0) S , with each value of \u03c9\u0304 representing a cluster, F\u03c9\u0304, of nearly degenerate levels in the true system. The UQME is obtained from the Redfield equation by making the secular approximation only with respect to well-separated levels. That is, terms in Eq. (5) with oscillatory factors ei(\u03c9 \u2032\u2212\u03c9)t are neglected only if \u03c9 and \u03c9\u2032 fall in different clusters so \u03c9\u2032\u2212\u03c9 \u2248 \u03c9\u0304\u2032\u2212 \u03c9\u0304 6= 0. These terms do oscillate on a faster timescale than that of the dissipative dynamics. Oscillating terms associated with pairs of nearby Bohr frequencies remain in the equation, but the rates are evaluated at these frequencies\u2019 common cluster centre to ensure complete positivity: \u03b3\u03b1\u03b2(\u03c9, \u03c9\n\u2032) \u2248 \u03b3\u03b1\u03b2(\u03c9\u0304, \u03c9\u0304) \u2261 \u03b3\u03b1\u03b2(\u03c9\u0304).

As these theorems serve as the microscopic basis for the Second Law of Thermodynamics at the level of averages, this is central to the investigation of the thermodynamic consistency of this quantum master equation. The fluctuation theorem is closely-linked to symmetries of the scaled cumulant\ngenerating function (CGF), G(\u03c7), which we may study by introducing a counting field vector, \u03c7, to the secondorder master equation15,59.\nIn particular, we are interested in the statistics of the energy current, Jj , flowing from each bath j, which can be understood in terms of the energy change of the bath itself, HB,j(0)\u2212HB,j(t) = \u222b t\n0 Jj(\u03c4)d\u03c4 . Jj is a stochastic\nvariable due to the Hamiltonian\u2019s status as a quantum of observable, and we can define a moment generating function for these energy changes as\nZ(\u03c7, t) \u2261 Tr [ ei \u2211 j \u03c7jHB,j(0)e\u2212i \u2211 j \u03c7jHB,j(t)\u03c1tot(0) ]\n, (11)\nwhere the counting field vector \u03c7 is composed of elements \u03c7j associated with individual baths. The derivatives of the function with respect to \u03c7j evaluated at \u03c7 = 0 give the moments of the distribution for the energy change in bath j, valid for all times. The scaled CGF, whose derivatives give the cumulants of the thermal energy current at long times, is then given by15,\nG(\u03c7) = lim t\u2192\u221e\n1 t lnZ(\u03c7, t). (12)\nWe will show how Eqs. (11) and (12) can be derived from a modified (so-called tilted) version of the UQME. The moment generating function Z(\u03c7, t) can be understood to be the trace over a counting field-dependent analogue of the total density operator, \u03c1\u03c7tot(t), which is given by the initial density operator, time-evolved by a modified propagator, U\u2212\u03c7(t). This propagator is, in turn, given by the solution to the Schro\u0308dinger equation if a \u03c7-dressed Hamiltonian is used: U\u2212\u03c7(t) = exp[\u2212iH\u2212\u03c7t], with\nH\u2212\u03c7 = e\u2212i \u2211 j \u03c7j 2 HB,jHei \u2211 j\u2032 \u03c7 j\u2032 2 HB,j\u2032\n= HS +HB + V \u2212\u03c7. (13)\nAs a consequence of commutation relations, the introduction of counting fields only impacts the interaction terms, which take the form,\nV \u2212\u03c7 = \u2211\nj\ne\u2212i \u03c7j 2 HB,jVje i \u03c7j 2 HB,j . (14)\nThe counting field-dressed total density operator evolves according to an equation analogous to the Liouville-von Neumann equation. In the interaction picture,\nd dt \u03c1\u03c7tot,I(t) = \u2212iV \u2212\u03c7 I (t)\u03c1 \u03c7 tot,I(t) + i\u03c1 \u03c7 tot,I(t)V \u03c7 I (t). (15)\nIn the weak coupling regime, we may derive an equation of motion for the counting field-dressed system reduced density operator \u03c1\u03c7 = TrB[\u03c1 \u03c7 tot] by making the same approximations as in Sec. II but substituting Eq. (13) as the Hamiltonian. We arrive at the counting field-dressed Unified quantum master equation.

            "text": "The moment generating function is formally given by\nZ(\u03c7, t) = Tr[eL(\u03c7)t\u03c10], (19)\nthus the energy transport statistics are determined by the eigenvalues \u03bb(\u03c7) of L(\u03c7). The symmetries of these eigenvalues carry through to the CGF. The eigenvalues are the solutions of the characteristic equation,\nC(\u03c7, \u03bb) = det(L(\u03c7) \u2212 \u03bb(\u03c7)I) = 0. (20)\nHere I is the identity matrix. The remainder of this section is devoted to proving the fluctuation symmetry of the moment generating function,\nZ(\u03c7, t) = Z(\u2212\u03c7\u2212 i\u03b2, t), (21)\nwhere \u03b2 is a vector whose elements are the inverse temperatures of the baths, \u03b2j = 1/(kBTj). We will do so by examining the properties of the characteristic function, C(\u03c7, \u03bb), as well as the counting field-dependent generator of time translations, L(\u03c7), itself. We assume that the interaction Hamiltonian, when written as a sum over terms of the form S\u03b1 \u2297 B\u03b1, consists only of system coupling operators with real-valued matrix elements. This includes typical raising and lowering operators of the form |a\u3009\u3008b|, but does not account\nfor more exotic interactions in which phase shifts are associated with transitions in the system. For any N -level quantum system interacting with thermal baths, it is possible to represent the counting fielddependent reduced density operator in superoperator notation, as an N2-dimensional column vector with N elements (say, the first N) representing \u03c7-dressed analogues of level populations, and the remaining N(N \u2212 1) elements corresponding to the \u03c7-dressed analogues of coherences. Then L(\u03c7) is anN2\u00d7N2 matrix which acts on the vector \u03c1\u03c7(t) to get its time derivative. However, there is no general prescription determining how to write L(\u03c7) in superoperator notation; it depends on the specifics of the system being considered, namely, which coherences are relevant to dynamics under the UQME. We wish to show that this matrix satisfies the following property67,68:\nL\u2020(\u2212\u03c7\u2212 i\u03b2) = LR(\u03c7), (22)\nwhere LR(\u03c7) is the generator of time translations for the time-reversed protocol. Since we consider here a Hamiltonian with no explicit time dependence, the timereversed generator is given simply by LR(\u03c7) = L\u2217(\u03c7)68. Thus, it suffices to show that66\nLT (\u2212\u03c7\u2212 i\u03b2) = L(\u03c7). (23)\nTo do so, it will be useful to understand how individual elements of \u03c1\u03c7(t) in the energy eigenbasis evolve under Eq. (16). Firstly, we note that the unitary part of L(\u03c7) is \u03c7-independent as it refers only to the system Hamiltonian HS and the Lamb Shift Hamiltonian HLS. Furthermore, this contribution to the generator manifests only in the diagonal elements of L(\u03c7) (in superoperator notation), as\n\u2212i\u3008a|[HS +HLS , \u03c1 \u03c7(t)]|b\u3009\n= \u2212i(HS,aa +HLS,aa \u2212HS,bb \u2212HLS,bb)\u03c1 \u03c7 ab(t) = \u2212i(\u03c9ab)\u03c1 \u03c7 ab(t), (24)\nwhere \u03c9ab has been redefined to incorporate the impacts of the Lamb Shift. Note that the unitary evolution of an element of \u03c1\u03c7ab(t) depends on no elements of \u03c1\n\u03c7(t) besides itself. Importantly, diagonal and off-diagonal elements with respect to the original N -dimensional Hilbert space should not be confused with those of L(\u03c7) in superoperator notation\u2013Eq. (24) holds even if a 6= b and still describes diagonal elements of L(\u03c7) in superoperator notation (the dependence of an element of \u03c1\u03c7(t) on itself). Therefore, the unitary part of L(\u03c7) satisfies Eq. (23) trivially. We now consider the dissipative contribution to the time evolution of \u03c1\u03c7(t). It suffices to show that the \u03c7dependent dissipator associated with any one bath j satisfies Eq. (23). It is useful to write explicitly the dissipative contribution of bath j towards the time derivative of a matrix element \u03c1\u03c7ab(t),\n6 \u3008a|Dj,\u03c7[\u03c1\u03c7(t)]|b\u3009 = \u2211\n\u03c9\u0304\n[\n\u2211\nc,d\n\u03b3j,\u03c7(ac),(bd)(\u03c9\u0304)\u03c1 \u03c7 cd(t)\u2212\n1\n2\n\u2211\nc,d\n\u03b3j(dc),(da)(\u03c9\u0304)\u03c1 \u03c7 cb(t)\u2212\n1\n2\n\u2211\nc,d\n\u03b3j(db),(dc)(\u03c9\u0304)\u03c1 \u03c7 ac(t)\n]\n, (25)\nwhere the bath-specific rates associated with given transitions are\n\u03b3j,\u03c7(ab),(cd)(\u03c9\u0304) = \u03b4\u03c9\u0304,\u03c9(0) ba \u03b4 \u03c9\u0304,\u03c9 (0) dc\n\u2211\n\u00b5,\u03bd\n\u03b3\u03c7j\u00b5,j\u03bd (\u03c9\u0304)\u3008a|Sj\u03bd |b\u3009\u3008d|S \u2020 j\u00b5|c\u3009.\n(26) We note that the counting field-dependence of these rates manifests as a complex phase, \u03b3j,\u03c7(ab),(cd)(\u03c9\u0304) = e\u2212i\u03c9 (0) ba\n\u03c7j\u03b3j(ab),(cd)(\u03c9\u0304), and that the rate is nonzero only\nwhen evaluated at a Bohr frequency, \u03c9\u0304, characterizing a cluster of levels of the system.\nWe want to identify the different ways that elements of \u03c1\u03c7(t) can depend on one another. This includes transfer of (\u03c7-dependent) population from one level to another. However, since the master equation is nonsecular, it also includes transfer from population to coherence and coherence to population, as well as the dependence of coherences on other coherences. In order to study each of these dependencies in detail, it is useful to re-write Eq.

(28) we assume a 6= b. Inspecting Eqs. (27) and (28), we can identify classes of matrix elements of Dj,\u03c7 if it were to be written in superoperator notation: those which couple diagonal elements of \u03c1\u03c7(t) to other diagonal elements, those which couple diagonal elements to offdiagonals, etc. This allows us to identify the explicit forms of pairs of matrix elements that are swapped under transposition. It is these pairs that we hope to prove are related by Eq. (23). For example, an off-diagonal element \u03c1\u03c7cd(t) may contribute via Dj,\u03c7 to \u03c1\u0307\u03c7aa(t), provided there exists a cluster of Bohr frequencies characterized by the value \u03c9\u0304 such that \u03c9 (0) ca = \u03c9 (0) da = \u03c9\u0304. The coefficient associated with this dependence is given by the second term of Eq. (27),\n\u2211\n\u03c9\u0304\ne\u2212i\u03c9\u0304\u03c7j\u03b3j(ac),(ad)(\u03c9\u0304)\n= \u2211\n\u03c9\u0304\ne\u2212i\u03c9\u0304\u03c7j \u03b4 \u03c9\u0304,\u03c9 (0) ca \u03b4 \u03c9\u0304,\u03c9 (0) da\n\u2211\n\u00b5,\u03bd\n\u03b3j\u00b5,j\u03bd (\u03c9\u0304)\u3008a|Sj\u03bd |c\u3009\u3008d|S \u2020 j\u00b5|a\u3009.\n(29)\nThe corresponding coefficient is that which characterizes the dependence of \u03c1\u0307\u03c7cd(t) on \u03c1 \u03c7 aa(t), which is given by the\nfirst term under the summation in Eq. (28) with appropriate relabelling of indices,\n\u2211\n\u03c9\u0304\ne\u2212i\u03c9\u0304\u03c7j\u03b3j(ca),(da)(\u03c9\u0304)\n= \u2211\n\u03c9\u0304\ne\u2212i\u03c9\u0304\u03c7j \u03b4 \u03c9\u0304,\u03c9 (0) ac \u03b4 \u03c9\u0304,\u03c9 (0) ad\n\u2211\n\u00b5,\u03bd\n\u03b3j\u00b5,j\u03bd (\u03c9\u0304)\u3008c|Sj\u03bd |a\u3009\u3008a|S \u2020 j\u00b5|d\u3009\n(30)\nMaking the substitution \u03c7j \u2192 \u2212\u03c7j \u2212 i\u03b2j here, we get,\n\u2211\n\u03c9\u0304\nei\u03c9\u0304\u03c7je\u2212\u03b2j \u03c9\u0304\u03b3j(ca),(da)(\u03c9\u0304)\n= \u2211\n\u03c9\u0304\ne\u2212i\u03c9\u0304\u03c7je\u03b2j \u03c9\u0304\u03b3j(ca),(da)(\u2212\u03c9\u0304)\n= \u2211\n\u03c9\u0304\ne\u2212i\u03c9\u0304\u03c7j\u03b3j(ac),(ad)(\u03c9\u0304), (31)\nwhere in the first step, we utilize the redefinition \u03c9\u0304 \u2192 \u2212\u03c9\u0304. This is permitted as, by construction, for each cluster of Bohr frequencies centred around \u03c9\u0304, there is a corresponding cluster at \u2212\u03c9\u0304 of all the same transitions in the reverse direction.\nIn the second step we use the assumption that matrix elements of the system coupling operators Sj\u00b5 are real. Each term in one summation then appears in the other. For example, suppose one of the system operators is a jump operator \u03c3 = |a\u3009\u3008c|. Then, in order to ensure Hermiticity of the Hamiltonian, the corresponding reverse jump operator \u03c3\u2020 = |c\u3009\u3008a|must appear as another system coupling operator. The term in the summation for one rate containing \u3008a|\u03c3|c\u3009 corresponds to the term in the summation for the other rate containing \u3008c|\u03c3\u2020|a\u3009, since \u3008c|\u03c3\u2020|a\u3009 = \u3008a|\u03c3|c\u3009\u2217 = \u3008a|\u03c3|c\u3009. We also use the local detailed balance relations satisfied by the rates given in Eq. (26), by virtue of the symmetry properties of the correlation functions, Eq. (7). In doing so, we have shown that this pair of matrix elements is consistent with the relation of Eq. (23).\nThere are eight other classes of pairs of matrix elements which can be shown using analogous arguments to satisfy the symmetry relation expressed in Eq. (23). They represent dependencies between elements of \u03c1\u03c7(t), some of which can be understood by inspecting Fig. 1. In the V model depicted here, two thermal baths can each excite transitions between a ground state and two nearly degenerate excited states, separated by \u2206 \u226a \u03bd. The co-\nherences between the two excited states, associated with the elements \u03c1\u03c723 and \u03c1 \u03c7 32 of the counting-dependent density operator are relevant to the dynamics and couple to the populations of the levels, associated with elements \u03c1\u03c711, \u03c1 \u03c7 22, and \u03c1 \u03c7 33.\nThe specific equations for the V model example are given in Sec. IV. Particularly, upon inspection of Eq. (42), one can see that each of the corresponding pairs of matrix elements satisfy the necessary relation for Eq. (23) to hold. We now write down the characteristic equation to solve for the eigenvalues of the generator evaluated at \u2212\u03c7 \u2212 i\u03b266:\ndet(L(\u2212\u03c7 \u2212 i\u03b2)\u2212 \u03bb(\u2212\u03c7\u2212 i\u03b2)I) = 0,\ndet(LT (\u2212\u03c7\u2212 i\u03b2)\u2212 \u03bb(\u2212\u03c7\u2212 i\u03b2)I) = 0,\ndet(L(\u03c7)\u2212 \u03bb(\u2212\u03c7\u2212 i\u03b2)I) = 0. (32)\nWe arrive at the second line by noting that transposition does not impact the determinant of a matrix, and at the third line by utilizing Eq. (23). The eigenvalues for the generator at the shifted value of the counting field, \u03bb(\u2212\u03c7\u2212 i\u03b2), are seen to be solutions of the characteristic equation for the non-shifted version, L(\u03c7), thus matching its eigenvalues. We have that each \u03bb(\u03c7) = \u03bb(\u2212\u03c7 \u2212 i\u03b2),\n8\nand thus the moment generating function satisfies the corresponding symmetry, Eq. (21) at all times. So does the scaled CGF in the long time limit:\nG(\u03c7) = G(\u2212\u03c7\u2212 i\u03b2). (33)\nThis steady state relation is demonstrated in Fig. 2 for the V system. Furthermore, as we discuss further in Sec. IV, we demonstrate in Fig. 3 that this symmetry is violated when the Redfield QME is used instead of the Unified QME for the same model. Eq. (33) can be shown to be equivalent to the familiar detailed fluctuation theorem15,16,66, which relates the steady-state probability of a process in which some amount of energy \u2206Ej is delivered to each bath j (characterized by a vector \u2206E) and that of its reverse process in which these quantities of energy are drawn from the baths (represented as \u2212\u2206E):\nlim t\u2192\u221e\nP\u2206E(t)\nP\u2212\u2206E(t) = e\n\u2211 j \u03b2j\u2206Ej = e\u2206S. (34)\nThe entropy production for this steady state process is identified as the sum over amounts of energy delivered to each bath multiplied by the bath inverse temperatures \u03b2j . Eq. (34) is a sufficient condition for the Second Law of Thermodynamics at the level of averages, \u3008\u2206S\u3009 \u2265 015."

The UQME is valid in the limit \u2206 \u226a \u03bd, in which coherence between the eigenstates |2\u3009 and |3\u3009 is most relevant to the overall dynamics. Two bosonic baths (L and R) at temperatures TL > TR couple to the system and can induce the transitions |1\u3009 \u2194 |2\u3009 and |1\u3009 \u2194 |3\u3009. The Hamiltonian of each bath is\nHB,j = \u2211\nk\n\u03c9k,jb \u2020 k,jbk,j , (36)\nwhere j = L,R and bk,j is the annihilation operator for a bosonic mode k of bath j with energy \u03c9k,j .

(37)\nThe real numbers gk,j characterize the coupling strength between the system and each bath mode. Since all the baths are independent and each has only one bath operator Bj , the only nonvanishing correlation functions between bath operators are autocorrelation functions, which are written with just one index for simplicity, Cj(\u03c4) = \u3008Bj(\u03c4)Bj(0)\u3009.

In deriving the UQME for this system, we identify three clusters of Bohr frequencies associated with values {\u2212\u03bd, 0, \u03bd} (another appropriate choice would be the average energy of the excited states, \u03bd\u2212\u2206/2, instead of \u03bd; the distinction is negligible in the limit \u2206 \u226a \u03bd). The lack of dissipative coupling between levels |2\u3009 and |3\u3009 means no rates that factor into the dynamics are associated with the cluster at \u03c9\u0304 = 0. Focusing on the positive frequency cluster \u03c9\u0304 = \u03bd, we calculate the half Fourier transform\n\u0393j(\u03bd) =\n\u222b \u221e\n0\nd\u03c4ei\u03bd\u03c4Cj(\u03c4) = \u03b3j(\u03bd)\n2 + iZj(\u03bd) \u2248\n\u03b3j(\u03bd)\n2 .\n(39)\nAt sufficiently high temperatures, it is possible to demonstrate that the imaginary part of the half Fourier transform is significantly less than the smallest energy scale in the problem, Zj(\u03bd) \u226a \u2206\n25. We therefore neglect it, which amounts to neglecting the Lamb shift. \u03b3j(\u03bd) is the rate of transitions induced by bath j,\n\u03b3j(\u03bd) = Jj(\u03bd)[nj(\u03bd) + 1], (40)\nwhere Jj(\u03c9) = 2\u03c0 \u2211 k g 2 k,j\u03b4(\u03c9\u2212\u03c9k,j) is the spectral density function of bath j, which we take to be of Ohmic form, Jj(\u03c9) = a\u03c9, with constant coefficient a the same for both baths. Local detailed balance then fixes the rates derived from the half Fourier transform evaluated at \u03c9\u0304 = \u2212\u03bd,\n\u03b3j(\u03bd)e \u2212\u03b2j\u03bd = \u03b3j(\u2212\u03bd) = Jj(\u03bd)nj(\u03bd). (41)\nThe counting field-dependent density operator has five relevant matrix elements in the system energy eigenbasis: the three diagonal elements, \u03c1\u03c711, \u03c1 \u03c7 22, and \u03c1 \u03c7 33, as well as the two off-diagonals, \u03c1\u03c723 and \u03c1 \u03c7 32. For this model, the remaining off-diagonals \u03c1\u03c712, \u03c1 \u03c7 13, \u03c1 \u03c7 21, and \u03c1 \u03c7 31 decouple from the others even under the full Redfield equation since Sj,23 = Sj,32 = 0. However, even if the required matrix elements were nonzero, the UQME would decouple these off-diagonals from the rest of \u03c1\u03c7(t) as a consequence of the large energy separation between their associated states.\nThus, the equations of motion for \u03c1\u03c7(t) may be written in superoperator notation as a 5\u00d75 matrix acting on the vector describing the quantum state, \u03c1\u03c7(t) = (\u03c1\u03c711(t), \u03c1 \u03c7 22(t), \u03c1 \u03c7 33(t), \u03c1 \u03c7 23(t), \u03c1 \u03c7 32(t))\nT . For simplicity, we apply counting only for energy leaving the L bath, so \u03c7 = (\u03c7L, \u03c7R) T \u2261 (\u03c7, 0)T . To write the rates without arguments, we define kj \u2261 \u03b3j(\u03bd) and k\u0303j \u2261 \u03b3j(\u2212\u03bd). We have \u03c1\u0307\u03c7(t) = L(\u03c7)\u03c1\u03c7(t), with\nL(\u03c7) =\n\n    \n\u22122k\u0303L \u2212 (\u03b1 2 + 1)k\u0303R kLe \u2212i\u03c7\u03bd + kR kLe \u2212i\u03c7\u03bd + \u03b12kR kLe \u2212i\u03c7\u03bd + \u03b1kR kLe \u2212i\u03c7\u03bd + \u03b1kR\nk\u0303Le i\u03c7\u03bd + k\u0303R \u2212kL \u2212 kR 0 \u2212 1 2 (kL + \u03b1kR) \u2212 1 2 (kL + \u03b1kR)\nk\u0303Le i\u03c7\u03bd + \u03b12k\u0303R 0 \u2212kL \u2212 \u03b1 2kR \u2212 1 2 (kL + \u03b1kR) \u2212 1 2 (kL + \u03b1kR)\nk\u0303Le i\u03c7\u03bd + \u03b1k\u0303R \u2212 1 2 (kL + \u03b1kR) \u2212 1 2 (kL + \u03b1kR) i\u2206\u2212 kL \u2212 1 2 (\u03b1 2 + 1)kR 0 k\u0303Le i\u03c7\u03bd + \u03b1k\u0303R \u2212 1 2 (kL + \u03b1kR) \u2212 1 2 (kL + \u03b1kR) 0 \u2212i\u2206\u2212 kL \u2212 1 2 (\u03b1 2 + 1)kR\n\n     .\n(42)\nBy inspecting Eq. (42), one can see that the counting field-dependent generator for the V system satisfies the symmetry of Eq. (23). The lower right 4\u00d74 block is \u03c7independent, and it is symmetric as needed. The transformation \u03c7 \u2192 \u2212\u03c7\u2212 i\u03b2 has the effect of transposing the first row and first column, which the subsequent transposition then counteracts. To see this, note that the first row and column do depend on \u03c7R, the exponentials e\u00b1i(0)\u03bd are just not shown explicitly. The transformation\nthen entails that \u03c7R \u2192 \u2212i\u03b2R. Thus, factors of e \u00b1\u03b2j\u03bd are introduced to each term, swapping the rates kj and k\u0303j as needed. It is clear from the structure of the counting fielddependent generator shown here how the arguments we employ extend to more general systems. Namely, the UQME satisfies fluctuation symmetry for any system with thermally activated transitions between clusters of nearly degenerate states. One can identify \u03c7-\n10\nindependent matrix blocks within the generator that relate elements of \u03c1\u03c7 strictly corresponding to states within the same cluster, and other blocks that have \u03c7dependence and describe transitions between clusters."

Finding the full analytic expression for G(\u03c7) entails solving the fifth-order characteristic polynomial, C(\u03c7, \u03bb). However, the fluctuation symmetry can be demonstrated by calculating the CGF numerically at both \u03c7 and the shifted value of the counting field, \u2212\u03c7\u2212 i\u03b2. Fig. 2 contains plots of the CGF for the V system evaluated at both of these points for varying \u2206, including at \u2206 \u226a \u03b3(\u03bd). In this limit, the Unified quantum master equation approaches a form identical to the Redfield equation for this model. Note that the relevant relationship when using an ohmic spectral density function [below Eq. (40)], and at high temperature, T > \u03bd, is \u2206 \u226a aT , independent of frequency \u2206 or \u03bd. As \u2206 grows the fluctuation symmetry is still seen to be satisfied, even as we approach the regime where the approximations leading to the UQME with levels 2 and 3 clustered are not valid. When the full Redfield equation is instead used to derive the cumulant generating function, explicit violations of fluctuation symmetry are evident in the regime that \u2206 & aT , and become more pronounced as \u2206 grows. This is seen in Fig. 3(d) and (f), as the curves corresponding to Im[G(\u03c7)] and Im[G(\u03c7\u2212 i\u03b2)] diverge from one another as \u03c7 grows. Thus, detailed fluctuation theorems as given in Eq. (34) do not, in general, follow from Redfield descriptions of open quantum system dynamics. We do note, however, that in our simulations, the real part of G(\u03c7) for the V system derived from the Redfield QME, while taking on values slightly different from\nthat derived from the Unifed QME, do display fluctuation symmetry (Fig. 3(a), (c) and (e)). Similarly, the imaginary part of the CGF from the Redfield-based description approximately satisfies the fluctuation symmetry for sufficiently small \u03c7. Thus, a Redfield-based analysis involving only the first cumulant (average heat current) and second cumulant (variance) should not uncover any direct violations of the Second Law at the level of averages."

In the linear response regime, when the temperature difference \u03b4T = TL \u2212 TR is smaller than any other energy scale in the problem, this means we expect even the Redfield equation to satisfy the Green-Kubo relation,\n\u2202\n\u2202(\u03b4\u03b2) \u3008J\u3009\n\u2223 \u2223\n\u03b4\u03b2=0 =\n1 2 \u3008\u3008J2\u3009\u3009 \u2223 \u2223 \u03b4\u03b2=0 , (43)\nand the symmetry between the next-lowest order terms in the expansions for \u3008J\u3009 and \u3008\u3008J2\u3009\u3009,\n\u22022\n\u2202(\u03b4\u03b2)2 \u3008J\u3009\n\u2223 \u2223\n\u03b4\u03b2=0 =\n\u2202\n\u2202(\u03b4\u03b2) \u3008\u3008J2\u3009\u3009\n\u2223 \u2223\n\u03b4\u03b2=0 , (44)\nwhere here, \u03b4\u03b2 = \u03b2R \u2212 \u03b2L with \u03b2j = 1/Tj the inverse temperature, and J \u2261 JL, the heat current flowing from the L bath. These two relations are demonstrated in Fig. 4, with, in each case, the left hand side represented by lines, and the right hand side represented by the coincident markers. We compare the predictions of the Redfield and Unified equations with those of the fully Secular master equation, which throws away all oscillating terms in Eq. (5) rather than only those that oscillate quickly. While, as shown, each equation satisfies the transport symmetries, the value of \u2206 has a strong bearing on whether the Unified or fully Secular equation gives results closer to those of the less approximate Redfield equation. Generally, the \u03b1 < 0 regime corresponds to the case where coherences have a more pronounced effect25, and the Secular equation, which neglects them, tends to diverge from Redfield. However, when \u2206 \u226b \u03b3, the UQME with clustering of Bohr frequencies is invalid. This is because the two excited states become far apart in energy, and so it is not effective to calculate transition rates based on a common Bohr frequency \u03c9\u0304 = \u03bd. Simultaneously, the timescale for the oscillations of terms coupling coherences to populations becomes sufficiently short that the full secular approximation is reasonable. Consequently, a proper implementation of the UQME would instead recognize each of\n11\nthe excited states as being in a cluster of its own, returning precisely the fully Secular equation. This equation outperforms the UQME with clustering in this regime, particularly when \u03b1 > 0, as seen in Fig. 4(b) and (d)."

Clearly, for a system with nearly-degenerate levels, the distinction between the Unified equation and the Redfield equation itself is minimal, and the Unified QME gives predictions for the mean heat current that match the Redfield equation very closely. In the opposite limit, the Secular equation\u2019s absence of coherences do not cause any significant issues, and it serves better not to cluster Bohr frequencies based on groups of levels nearby in energy. There is, however, a crossover regime (unshaded region) at which \u2206 \u2248 \u03b3, and neither the Unified with clustered excited states nor the fully Secular equation gives a prediction for the mean current that matches the Redfield equation closely. As such, it remains an open question whether, in this regime, there is a master equation description for open quantum systems that is of a GKLS form, thermodynamically consistent, and gives accurate predictions for statistics of heat currents. We note that when properly using the UQME, one should refrain from clustering the excited states once their separation becomes large. In this case, results of the UQME should turn (alas in a discontinuous manner) into the fully secular approach within the unshaded re-\ngion of Fig. 5.\nWe can similarly inspect the predictions made by both the Unified and Redfield equations for the coherences at steady state, particularly the real and imaginary parts of the density matrix element \u03c123 associated with the two excited states. Once again, as seen in Fig. 6, Unified and Redfield equations give rise to values that are close when \u2206 \u226a \u03b3, but begin to diverge as \u2206 grows. In the larger \u2206 region, the Redfield equation predicts smaller values in the \u03b1 < 0 region, especially for the imaginary part. This is more in accordance with the fully Secular master equation which predicts that all eigenstate coherences vanish at steady state (not shown).\nWe point out that coherences are rather small in Fig. 6. This is because of the high temperature, T \u226b \u03bd, and small temperature difference, \u03b4T \u226a \u03bd, employed in this example. As was shown in Ref. 25, steady state coherences in the V model scale as Re[\u03c1SS23 ] \u221d ( e\u2212\u03b2R\u03bd \u2212 e\u2212\u03b2L\u03bd ) and Im[\u03c1SS23 ] \u221d \u2206 k Re[\u03c1SS23 ]."

The TUR was derived originally for classical Markovian dynamics and shown to hold in certain cases for quantum heat transport80. For heat transport between two\nreservoirs at steady state, it takes the form,\n\u3008\u03c3\u3009 \u3008\u3008J2\u3009\u3009\n\u3008J\u30092 = \u03b4\u03b2\n\u3008\u3008J2\u3009\u3009\n\u3008J\u3009 \u2265 2.

As discussed, these two cumulants of the current, even when calculated using Redfield equations, do not directly exhibit any violations of fluctuation symmetry. We see that in all cases, the TUR is satisfied as \u03b4T increases, with the TUR ratio converging to 2 in the equilibrium limit, despite taking on different values for the three equations when \u03b4T > 0. The close correspondence between the Unified and Redfield equations reflects the small value used for \u2206 in the simulations, corresponding to the case where coherences at steady state are non-negligible, as discussed above and observed also in Fig. 4. The main nontrivial observation from Fig. 7 is that while the Secular current is significantly higher than what is predicted by the Unified or Redfield equation for the presented parameters at small \u2206 (recall Fig. 5), the TUR ratio itself is almost identical between the methods, even far from equilibrium."

            "text": "We have investigated the question of whether the Unified quantum master equation gives rise to a cumu-\n13\nlant generating function for the statistics of heat currents that satisfies the heat exchange fluctuation symmetry. Our findings demonstrate that this is indeed the case for general quantum systems interacting with thermal baths. We have therefore shown that it is possible to achieve thermodynamic consistency with a master equation-based description of open quantum systems that does not make the full secular approximation with respect to all oscillating terms in the Redfield equation. The UQME retains the effect of eigenstate coherences, which, in turn, do not vanish at steady state. Coherences are important precisely in the regime where the UQME differs from the fully Secular QME: when systems have nearly-degenerate energy levels, such that the approximations leading to the fully Secular master equation are not valid.\nIn particular, we have shown based on a symmetry of the counting field-dependent Liouvillian, L(\u03c7), associated with the UQME, that each of its eigenvalues satisfies the symmetry relation \u03bb(\u03c7) = \u03bb(\u2212\u03c7 \u2212 i\u03b2). The so-called \u201cdominant\u201d eigenvalue\u2013the one whose real part approaches zero as \u03c7 approaches zero\u2013is exactly the CGF for heat current statistics at steady state. However, the\nsatisfaction of this symmetry by all eigenvalues indicates that energy transport statistics are thermodynamically consistent at all times, not just in the long-time limit. We have exemplified our results on the V system, a minimal model exhibiting a pair of nearly degenerate excited states, between which coherences survive in steady state transport. Fluctuation symmetry is manifest in the specific Unified equations of motion for the reduced density operator of this system when written out. We further identified regimes in which the Redfield equation itself is approximately thermodynamically consistent, and thus leads to predictions that still satisfy transport symmetries such as the Green-Kubo relation. Our simulations also indicate a crossover from the regime of validity of the Unified QME with the excited states clustered to that of the fully Secular QME as the energy splitting between excited states grows. Then, the impact of coherences on the overall dynamics diminishes, and the supposition that Bohr frequencies of the system can be categorized neatly into \u201cclusters\u201d no longer adheres to reality. Thus, while the Unified QME is positivity-preserving and thermodynamically consistent regardless of which energy levels are clustered together, the spectrum of the system Hamiltonian must be taken into consideration when assessing how this clustering should be carried out, and whether a UQME should be used that differs from the fully Secular equation2. The UQME allows studies of transport fluctuations while including prominent coherences. This method can therefore be used to derive cost-precision tradeoffs in the operation of quantum thermal machines, testing results based on the Lindblad formalism81. Finally, the principles of the UQME can be readily applied to master equations that account for strong system-bath couplings. Developing e.g., a polaron-transformed56\u201358 UQME and a reaction-coordinate UQME60\u201363 is left for future work."
