            "text": "Logistics is characterized by offering a variety of logistics activities and management solutions, such as services related to the transportation, storage, packaging, distribution, etc., of goods. The biggest challenge for the logistics sector is the question of how to keep customers satisfied and how to meet their expectations. The increasing globalization of the economy and intense competition gives the customer a need for reduced service time and cost reductions. Thus, to fulfill customers\u2019 needs, supply chain integration has been increased, see [1]. As such, logistics, information and communication technology (ICT) facilitates the integration of supply chain activities. The relevance and importance of ICT to logistics companies are seen in the provision of accurate information, which has to be obtained on time, allowing data sharing among companies and their partners in the supply chain. This leads to the enhancing of decision-making solutions, see [2]. Today\u2019s fast-growing technology companies leverage global supply chains and IT services. ICT supports multiple business processes in logistics and it is related to customer relationship management (CRM), IT international network services, cloud technology, delivery tracking and more. The present paper is a continuation of our previous research conducted in this direction introduced in [3]. The current investigation on the Non-central Polya-Aeppli process introduced in [4] focuses on the application of this stochastic process in the supply chain management (SCM) of the electronic industry. It is a sum of the Polya-Aeppli process introduced and characterized in [5,6] and a homogeneous Poisson process. The Polya-Aeppli process (PAP) is a compound Poisson process with a geometric compounding distribution and rate \u03bb1 > 0. It is given by the notation N1(t) \u2208 PA(\u03bb1t, \u03c1), where \u03c1 \u2208 [0, 1) is a parameter known as a correlation coefficient, see [7]. It is an over-dispersed process related to the standard Poisson process, see [5,6]. This property gives good flexibility, especially when we speak about data with a big dispersion. A good indicator for this is the Fisher index of dispersion, which was introduced by Fisher in 1934 [8]. It expresses the\nComputation 2023, 11, 21. https://doi.org/10.3390/computation11020021 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/computation\nratio of a random variable\u2019s variance to its mathematical expectation, see [9]. The Fisher index can be calculated by the following formula:\nFI(N) = Var(N) E(N) . (1)\nAs such, when we speak about data with a big dispersion, the over-dispersion property is very valuable. In the present paper, we analyze the properties of the Non-central Polya-Aeppli process. It is applied as a counting stochastic process in electronic process management in which two types of customer requests, namely those that are unprocessed and not sent on time, are counted by the given process. Section 3 is devoted to electronic management and industry. The significant part of this paper is given in Section 4, where the application of electronic process management is implemented by the Non-central Polya-Aeppli process and its nice properties. It continues our previous study on stochastic processes and their application in supply chain management in the electronic industry [3]."

The counting process starts at zero, and for each t > 0, the corresponding distribution of the process is the Non-central Polya-Aeppli distribution, see [10]. Some useful and nice properties of this distribution are presented in [10]. The authors give some visualizations based on the idea of changing the different values of the parameters \u03bb1, \u03bb2 and \u03c1. The visualizations show that this corresponding distribution is a right-tailed distribution, and it could be a suitable distribution for data in an industry in which such kind of distribution is applicable. A good fact regarding the Non-central Polya-Aeppli process is that this stochastic process is a pure birth process, see [4]."

SCM is also the management of interrelated parts that work together to produce and deliver products to customers accurately and quickly. Its goal is to achieve maximum customer satisfaction, lower costs and competitive business advantages. SCM software is a program which has been developed to control end-to-end business processes across the supply chain, perform demand planning and forecasting and manage supplier relationships. These systems are useful to businesses in industries across the world. SCM software is a helpful tool for automating, which comprises much of the physical SCM process and provides analytics\nComputation 2023, 11, 21 3 of 9\nand business intelligence for growth in terms of delivering goods on time. The benefit of this process is that it determines the customers\u2019 added value at a minimal cost [2,10\u201312]. Companies that integrate computer systems into their business benefit from information management and decision making to improve procurement management, and they also have better collaboration with partners and avoid delays in the delivery of material resources [13\u201316].

More detailed informatio about the presented soft r can be found in [27].\nIn SCM, some mathematical optimization techniques are applied. They can be used at different levels, taking into account factors such as transport route, distribution networks or warehouse operations. Popular mathematical modeling approaches that are used in SCM problems are linear and nonlinear programming, multi-objective programming,\nfuzzy mathematical programming, stochastic programming, heuristic algorithms, and metaheuristic and hybrid models [28\u201330]. Unfortunately, existing software solutions make little use of the advanced mathematical results. Usually, software is required to be able to address a large class of issues in order to be suitable for practical use. Software companies demand developers with broad competence (e.g., full-stack developers) to take care of various aspects of the product. Only the biggest international companies can afford to include mathematics-oriented experts in the development process. However, again due to the overall complexity of the product, the underlying science is usually limited to the basics of queueing theory and linked topics in computational algorithms. There is little focus on the optimization of the results with respect to business-related criteria. On the other hand, the current tendency, as we mentioned earlier, is to focus on multi-purpose software rather than custom specialized solutions, maybe mainly due to economic reasoning. As such, in our opinion, a trade-off between the breadth and depth of software capabilities must be always made, tailoring the solution to every situation."

            "text": "We consider that a certain business company produces two types of electronic components. The first type of electronic components is motion sensors and the second one is heat sensors. The customers\u2019 flow requests come to the business company electronically. Within a period of three days, the requests have to be processed. After this period, the ordered components have to be sent back to the customers. If the company does not complete the processing request and does not return the request on time to the client, then it has to pay a penalty fee for this delay. Let the state of the business company at a time t where u is the initial capital is denoted by the following stochastic process:\nP(t) = u + \u03c0(t)\u2212 SN(t), t \u2265 0,\nwhere \u03c0(t) is a non-negative function with finite variation. The sum u + \u03c0(t) describes the company\u2019s revenue growth and the accumulated sum SN(t) determines the company\u2019s expenditures. Then, the process P(t) defined on the complete probability space (\u2126, F, P) represents the profit of the company\u2019s business in the time interval [0, t], see [3]. Profit \u03c0(t) is usually modeled as a deterministic algebraic function [31]. The company\u2019s profit model is essentially its plan to make the business viable and thriving. In detail, it shows how to realize the potential revenue planned in the profit or business model. There are four types of profit models:\n\u2022 Production model: this involves the creation of products or service, which is sold to the client. The company usually buys raw materials and produces goods with added value; \u2022 Rental/leasing model: the company owns equipment, machinery, land, buildings, vehicles, etc., which are provided to the customer for temporary use. After the end of the contract, the subject of the deal remains property of the owner; \u2022 Advertising model: this involves providing a platform that businesses can use to promote their products or services. The customers pay for advertising, while the ads are usually free for their target audience; \u2022 Commission model: this includes offering services to the clients. \u2022 The company in our study case obviously follows the production business model.\nUsually, the fixed costs can be well approximated. The same is true for the sales costs and, to some extent, the sales revenue per unit production. The volatile component is the sold quantity q. If the company is niched in B2B contracts, the produced quantity is preordered. Very often, contracts allow the quantity to be changed in some range (e.g., \u00b120%) but this option is only occasionally activated. In contrast, if the company is\npositioned in the B2C market, then the sold quantities are unknown in advance. Of course, there are always expectations based on market surveys, regression or other assumptions, but they do not guarantee sold production or satisfied customers. Thus, the sold quantities are suitable for stochastic modeling, but the underlying conjectures must be carefully selected. What is more in this case, the selling price p is also not a constant or even deterministic, but it is a function of many factors, such as product demand, economic conjuncture and many others. Modeling the sales revenue as a stochastic process is a complex problem and is a matter of other in-depth research.\nThe key components of a profit model are the following:\n\u2022 Production component: the step a product or service has to go through before it can be sold to customers in its final form; \u2022 Operation component: this involves all the equipment for the product and personnel; \u2022 Sales and marketing component: this is about getting the product ready for people, aiming to create interest among potential customers; \u2022 Delivery component: this comprises bringing the product or service to the end customer.\nThe profit model could be expressed in analytical terms in a simple way:\n\u03c0(t) = pq\u2212 (Ft + wq), (4)\nwhere pq is the total sales revenue, wq is the total sales cost and Ft is the administration costs. The total sales revenue is the sum of all incomes from the products that are actually sold as follows:\npq = n\n\u2211 i=1 piqi.\nThe total sales costs are the sum of all expenditures for all products sold as follows:\nwq = n\n\u2211 i=1 wiqi.\nFor our study case company, it sells n = 2 products. The average unit production cost includes both the fixed and variable costs. If one\nwants to separate the fixed and variable costs, they may write the following:\nw = f\nq1 + q2 + v1 + v2,\nwhere qi is the sold quantities from the i-th product, vi is the variable costs per unit, and f is the fixed manufacturing costs. There are a number of financial indicators which must be carefully controlled. The first is the profit margin:\nGross Profit Margin = p\u2212 w\np ,\nNet Profit Margin = \u03c0(t) pq .\nThe asset turnover ratio reveals the efficiency of the usage of assets to generate sales revenue. It shows how many dollars in revenue are generated for every dollar in assets as follows:\nAsset Turnover Ratio = pq\nu + \u03c0(t) .\nThe return on equity measures the investment success in business, which can be calculated as follows:\nReturn on Equity = \u03c0(t)\nu + \u03c0(t) .\nAs discussed, some companies sign long-term contracts, and they know exactly the number and the size of their order in advance. Regarding our case study company (and many others), it receives the orders and collects them on a three-day basis, so the profit components depend on time.\n\u03c0(t) = pq(t)\u2212 (Ft + wq(t)).\nIn this case, the ordered quantities are unknown in advance. There exist many approaches to forecast them, the most advanced of which are based on historical time series data. Amongst the most popular methods are ARIMA-type methods, neural networks and the modified ODE approach [32]. The time series could be forecasted in solitude [33] or coupled with other time series [34]. In contrast, the accumulated sum up for the time t of the company\u2019s penalties for requests that are unprocessed and returned on time is purely stochastic, and it is given as follows:\nSN(t) = N(t)\n\u2211 i=1 Zi, t \u2265 0,\nThe process { SN(t), t \u2265 0 }\nis a random sum of random variables with the condition that S(t) = 0. when the counting process N(t) = 0. The counting process N(t) = sup{n : \u03c3n \u2264 t}, t \u2265 0, where 0 \u2264 \u03c31 \u2264 \u03c32 \u2264 \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 represents the time of request arrivals in the Non-central Polya-Aeppli process, see [4]. The interpretation of the counting process is that there are two types of requests that are unprocessed and returned on time to the customers. The first type is counted by the Polya-Aeppli process, and the second type is counted by the homogeneous Poisson process. The intensity functions of the two stochastic processes give the processing speed of the two types of requests that the company offers to the market. They can be measured by the orders flows that the business company could not send on time to its customers. The relations between the time of the request\u2019s arrivals and the counting process {N(t), t \u2265 0} are given by the following:\n{N(t) = n} = {\u03c3n \u2264 t < \u03c3n+1}, n = 0, 1, . . .\nThe sequence {Zn, n = 1, 2, . . .} of independent and identically distributed random variables with common distribution function F, F(0) = 0 and expectation \u00b5 is independent of the counting process N(t), see [10]."

The main aim of the present paper is to determine the firm\u2019s profit and to construct a good model with applications in supply chain management. The importance of ICT for logistics and supply chain management (SCM) is seen in the provision of accurate information that allows data sharing within the company and supply chain partners. This improves decision-making policy. With SCM services, users can evolve supply chain processes into intelligent workflows and thus they can reach new levels of innovation.
