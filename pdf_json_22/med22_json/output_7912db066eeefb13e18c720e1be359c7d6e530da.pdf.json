    "abstractText": "Background: Capsular contracture (CC) is a common long-term complication following prosthetic-based breast reconstruction (PBBR). Seven cases of CC following mRNA vaccination for coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) are reported in the literature. Objectives: The aim of this study was to determine whether receiving the COVID-19 vaccine was associated with CC development following PBBR. Methods: A retrospective, multicenter nested case-control study was performed from January 2014 to July 2022 of adult female patients who underwent PBBR with acellular dermal matrix placement. Cases of CC were selected if no adjuvant radiation was received and they presented for follow-up between December 2020 and July 2022. Controls included patients who met inclusion criteria but who did not experience CC in either breast. Patient demographics, breast cancer characteristics, reconstructive surgery details, postoperative complications, and COVID-19 exposure details were analyzed and correlated with CC development. Results: Of a total of 230 patients (393 breasts) who received PBBR, 85 patients (135 breasts) met inclusion criteria, of whom 12 patients (19 breasts) developed CC and 73 patients (116 breasts) did not. At the time of median follow-up of 18.1 months (n = 85; interquartile range, 12.2-33.6 months), no statistically significant differences were observed between the shortor long-term complications in cases or controls. There were no significant differences in COVID-19 vaccination status, number of vaccine doses, or vaccination type between cases and controls. Vaccination status was not associated with greater odds of CC development (odds ratio, 1.44; 95% CI, 0.42-5.37; P > .05). Conclusions: Direct association between CC and COVID-19 vaccination is difficult to prove. Given the known risk of severe COVID-19 infection among immunocompromised patients, those with breast cancer who undergo PBBR should be properly counseled on the benefits and risks of vaccination.

The factors that instigate fibrosis of CC are elusive, but are thought to involve increased cellularity, angiogenesis, and cytokine activity, ultimately manifesting as a proinflammatory foreign body response to the implant surface.2 Potential risk factors include radiation therapy, smooth implant texture, subglandular placement, partial muscle coverage, infection, seroma, and hematoma.3\u20136\nIn response to the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, biomedical research and emergent FDA approval facilitated the rapid distribution of mRNA vaccines, with the first dose administered on December 13, 2020.7 Widespread dissemination of the vaccine and monitoring for adverse effects precipitated case reports of potentially associated phenomena. Although reported systemic adverse effects such as myocarditis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, and cerebral venous thrombosis can be life-threatening, the majority of local cutaneous reactions are transient and resolve with conservative measures.8,9 Reports of CC-like symptoms after COVID-19 vaccination have raised suspicion of an immunologic response to implants.10,11 Theoretically, injection of the vaccine into the arm could precipitate a transient and localized reaction surrounding the prosthesis, similar to the axillary lymphadenopathy that arises in 1.1% of patients following COVID-19 vaccination.12\nRegardless of theoretical plausibility, understanding the clinical significance of any proposed association between CC and COVID-19 vaccination is of vital importance. Many individuals undergo breast reconstruction for a primary malignancy and should be vaccinated due to an increased risk of developing severe COVID-19 infection.13 Yet, the previous case reports of postvaccination CC may discourage some within this patient population from seeking initial vaccination or subsequent booster doses.14 As such, we sought to investigate whether exposure to COVID-19 vaccination was associated with CC development through a retrospective, multicenter nested case-control study with the objective to better inform the continued use of COVID-19 vaccination among this frequently immunocompromised population."

The source population was a defined registry of all breasts receiving\nimplant- or tissue expander (TE)-based breast reconstruction with acellular dermal matrix (ADM) placement at 4 institutions between 2014 and 2022. The cases and controls were selected from patients with follow-up between December 2020 and July 2022, to reflect when exposure to COVID-19 vaccination first became possible in December 2020.7 Cases were identified as the clinical documentation of CC during this timeframe. Using publicly available vaccination data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; Atlanta, GA) website, vaccination prevalence among individuals in the United States aged 25 to 75 years of age between December 2020 and July 2022 was 70.6%. The prevalence of vaccination was used to calculate the sample size sufficient to detect a true difference in the odds of CC within this population of 3 or more. We excluded breasts that underwent previous revisional surgeries without implant exchange or delayed implant-based breast reconstruction as well as patients who had received adjuvant radiation following reconstruction. The final cases and controls were selected from within this temporally defined group of breasts with respect to inclusion criteria based on a case to control ratio of 1:6 with no significant differences in mean ages (Figure 1)."

Breast cancer details included the histopathologic subtype, previous surgeries/ biopsies, and use of (neo)adjuvant radiation and chemotherapy. Operative information included the type of oncologic resection as applicable, incision type, and type of reconstruction.

COVID-19\u2013related exposures included record of COVID-19 positivity (rapid/polymerase chain reaction testing or per clinical documentation), hospitalization for COVID-19 infection, and details pertaining to receipt of COVID-19 vaccination.\nCC was defined by clinical documentation from the respective attending plastic surgeon, breast surgeon, or oncology physician following full clinical evaluation during regularly scheduled outpatient follow-up visits. To meet inclusion criteria, each CC diagnosis was required to include either a patient photograph, physical exam description in the clinical documentation, or reported Baker classification. Only explicitly reported descriptions of CC presentation, degree, and associated medical decision-making were included in our analysis. The time to CC from reconstruction was calculated by taking the first date of documented CC diagnosis and subtracting the date of the index surgery. Similarly, the time to CC development from COVID-19 vaccination was calculated by taking the date of COVID-19 vaccination occurring after the index reconstructive surgery and closest to CC development, and then subtracting this date from the date of the index reconstructive surgery. This method was selected to establish time intervals similar to those observed in previous case reports.10,11 Measures of\nclinical evaluation included associated symptoms, leukocyte count, and the Baker scale of CC (Grades I-IV). Medical and surgical treatment specific to CC was documented when trialed.\nOutcome Variables and Study Groups\nThe primary outcome of interest was the odds of CC following COVID-19 vaccination. Diagnostic criteria included reported CC in the clinical note as described above.

Recently, there have been a total of 7 reports of implant-related reactions following COVID-19 vaccination.10,11 A comparison of vaccination rates between the\n19 cases of CC to the 116 control breasts in our nested casecontrol study revealed no significant association between CC development and COVID-19 vaccination status. Further, an analysis within the 19 cases demonstrated that there were no differences in the degree or timing of CC between the vaccinated and unvaccinated cases. Although a total of 3 CC cases required implant exchange, only 1 occurred following vaccination, presenting 341 days after vaccination. Ultimately, the lack of an association between COVID-19 vaccination and clinically severe CC underscores the safety of vaccination in this patient population.\nAt baseline, our cases and controls would have been considered at similar risk of CC due to our exclusion of irradiated breasts and the lack of statistically significant differences in known risk factors. Additionally, ADMs are associated with clinical decreases in CC incidence as well as a histologic reduction in immune cells and proinflammatory cytokines.2,18\u201320 The source population consisted of a multicenter registry limited to immediate primary prosthetic breast surgery using ADMs and therefore both cases and controls were likely to benefit from any additional protection ADM offers.

Although periareolar incisions have previously been associated with increased rates of postoperative CC, there are limited data regarding the direct relationship between mastectomy type (eg, nipple-sparing, skin-sparing, partial, radical) and CC rate.22,23 Although this trend did not reach statistical significance in our study, future investigations are warranted to better understand the possible relationship between mastectomy type and CC development.\nOur 19 cases presented differently than previous case reports. While only 1 case of postvaccination CC necessitated operative intervention in our study (6.7%), 42.9% (n = 3) of previously reported cases required surgical management.10 Among the reports of CC necessitating surgical intervention, all were unilateral, becoming symptomatic within 2 to 19 days of vaccination and 2 to 144 months postoperatively.10,11 At the surface, these cases imply a possible correlation between vaccination and CC that is both biologically and temporally plausible.\nThe molecular basis of the adverse effects of mRNA COVID-19 vaccination is considered a proinflammatory, profibrotic dose-response reaction to encoded SARS-CoV-2 spike proteins (S protein) and downstream activation of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2.9 Subanalysis of our CC cases did not reveal any evidence of dose-response relationships between number of vaccine doses and presence of CC when assessed by patient or by breast (Table 4). We also found no relationship between overall vaccination status and degree of CC. If a patient mounts a physical reaction to COVID-19 vaccination, it would likely be a reflection of the time to immune detection of the S protein.8,24,25 In turn, the adverse effects related to the delayed immunogenicity of S proteins should be expected when both the concentration and the immunological recognition are the highest.26 The systemic concentration of the S protein has been observed to peak 1 day after vaccination and fell below detectable levels within 10 days.27 However, Cosentino and Marino describe endogenous production of the S protein at the level of tissue and explain that sustained localized high concentrations may precipitate adverse effects.26 Although possible, neither the results of this study nor the case reports currently in the literature alone would necessarily suggest that the scant leftover tissue following\nTable 4.

Furthermore, a recent systematic review of the literature surrounding cutaneous reactions to vaccination reported most were self-limited and resolved within days to weeks. Given the relative infrequency of such reactions, compounded with a multitude of confounding factors, it remains difficult to prove a direct relationship between vaccination and cutaneous reactions as opposed to coincidence without causality.28\nOur findings that COVID-19 vaccination was not a significant predictor of CC development informs its continued use among this particularly vulnerable patient population. The increased risk of severe COVID-19 illness among immunocompromised individuals is well documented, leading to severe infection in up to 26.7% of breast cancer patients.29\u201331 While other adverse events (eg, acute myocardial infarction, Bell\u2019s palsy, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, myocarditis, herpes zoster reactivation, autoimmunity) have been reported following COVID-19 vaccination, these severe adverse events are relatively rare, occurring up to 0.228% of the time.32 We found that all but 2 of the postvaccination cases of CC improved with conservative treatment such as massage therapy and leukotriene inhibitor trials.8 This suggests that even if vaccination and CC are in fact related, associated cases may be of mild severity. Further, given the subjective nature of CC diagnoses, local cutaneous reactions may be mistaken for mild CC, highlighting the importance of trialing conservative treatment prior to surgical intervention. In total, the risk of severe COVID-19 infection appears to outweigh the risks of adverse reaction to vaccination, particularly among patients with breast cancer. Given preexisting vaccine hesitancy within this patient population, providers should provide proper counseling regarding the risks and benefits of receiving COVID-19 vaccination.14\nThis case-control study has several limitations, including its retrospective nature, which relies on the quality of the EMRs. Further, COVID-19 vaccination documentation was often incomplete or missing, especially in regards to vaccine type (Pfizer, Moderna, etc), preventing a thorough analysis of the relationship between vaccine type and CC across the entirety of our cohort. Although 230 patients were screened, only 85 met inclusion criteria, thus limiting the overall sample size. Although inclusion of only patients with ADM placement limits the generalizability of our results, our multicenter design helps to counter this limitation. Larger studies incorporating patients who underwent prosthetic breast surgery with and without ADM placement are therefore indicated. Because only 1 patient contracted COVID-19 infection between surgery and CC development, we were unable to assess associations between infection and CC. One-to-one age, sex, or race matching was not performed due to limitations in sample size; however, there were no statistically significant differences in demographic data between groups. Despite these limitations, this study, to the authors\u2019 knowledge, is the first to assess whether COVID-19 vaccination is associated with higher odds of CC development."
