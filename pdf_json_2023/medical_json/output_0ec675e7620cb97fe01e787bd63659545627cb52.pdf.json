Additionally, we analyzed the material properties, cellular reactions, and biocompatibility of the hydrogels. We further demonstrated that the topical application of GelMA-Exos could accelerate reendothelialization after autologous vein transplantation and reduce restenosis in the rat model. Notably, GelMA-Exos caused neither damage to major organs in mice nor excessive immune rejection. The uptake of GelMA-Exos by endothelial cells stimulated cell proliferation and migration in vitro. A bioinformatic analysis of existing databases revealed that various cell proliferation and apoptosis pathways, including the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR)\u2013phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)\u2013AKT signaling pathways, might participate in the underlying regulatory mechanism.\nConclusions Compared with the tail vein injection of hUCMSC-Exos, the local application of a mixture of hUCMSCExos and GelMA was more effective in promoting endothelial repair of the vein graft and inhibiting restenosis. Therefore, the proposed biomaterial-based therapeutic approach is a promising treatment for venous graft restenosis."

            "text": "The incidence of cardiovascular disease has been increasing in recent years. Coronary artery disease has become an important \u201ckiller\u201d that threatens the health of middleaged and elderly people. In clinical practice, autogenous vein coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) is often used to treat atherosclerotic heart disease (1). However, venous graft restenosis is a common postoperative complication that can have serious consequences. Studies have shown that approximately 15\u201330% of patients develop symptoms of venous obstruction within one year of hospital discharge (2). Therapeutic approaches to resolve venous graft restenosis can effectively prevent the complications of a second operation in patients with coronary artery disease.\nMesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are multi-lineage cells, which can self-renew and differentiate into various tissue cells (such as adipocytes and chondrocytes) and are active \u201cstar\u201d cells in the field of regenerative medicine (3). Moreover, existing studies have shown that MSCs have paracrine functions and play a key role in MSCbased therapies (4). Two main paracrine pathways are associated with MSCs: the secretion of cytokines and the secretion of extracellular vesicles (EVs) (5). EVs contain various signaling factors, for example ribonucleic acid (RNA), microRNA (miRNA), and proteins, which can play regulatory roles through humoral transport throughout the body (6). Moreover, cell-free treatment with EVs offers better stability and safety than direct stem cell transplantation (7). Recently, MSC-derived exosomes have been found to restrain restenosis in venous grafts (6). However, there are difficulties in the utilization of MSC-derived exosomes for the treatment of venous graft restenosis because exosomes are easily deactivated by environmental factors, such as temperature, and are easy to be removed in vivo. Therefore, extending the retention time of exosomes around venous grafts by combining them with biomaterials, without disturbing their biological function, has become a research hotspot in biomedical engineering.\nHydrogels are porous, loose structures formed from naturally derived or synthetic polymers, which usually have excellent swelling properties and certain mechanical properties, thus playing an important role in medical fields, such as tissue repair and remodeling (8). Therefore, hydrogels are a promising substitute for extracellular matrices as a good scaffold or carrier for maintaining the functions of stem cells and their derivatives in vivo (9). Compared to traditional oral or subcutaneous routes, hydrogels carrying therapeutic factors can evade metabolic activity in the liver and other tissues, resulting\nin better therapeutic effects (10). Furthermore, inclusion of exosomes in the hydrogel resulted in a substantial reduction in the exosome degradation rate in vitro (11). In addition, therapeutic factors in exosomes can be directly delivered locally when exosomes are bound to hydrogels and applied near the target tissue (12). Shi et al. combined human gingival MSC-derived exosomes with hydrogels and applied them around the wound tissue in rats with diabetes to improve wound healing (13). Moreover, a photoinduced crosslinking hydrogel was found to be effective in maintaining the activity of exosomes, and application of this combination to the disease model of bone and joint defects yielded good results (14). Although exosome-supported hydrogels have been used in various disease models, such as those of tissue damage and joint repair, only few studies have combined cord blood MSCs with hydrogels to treat restenosis in venous grafts.\nCompared with MSCs from other sources (such as bone marrow), human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells (hUCMSCs) have the following advantages: noninvasive access, rapid self-renewal and proliferation, and low immunogenicity (15). Therefore, we aimed to develop a biocompatible hydrogel capable of carrying hUCMSC exosomes (hUCMSC-Exos) to inhibit intimal hyperplasia in venous grafts. Methacrylated gelatin (GelMA) is a hydrogel that can be polymerized via a free-radical reaction after irradiation with ultraviolet light in the presence of a photoinitiator (16). Compared to other polymerization methods, photopolymerization has numerous advantages, such as ease of use, plasticity according to the mold, and certain mechanical properties (17). Moreover, GelMA has a porous structure that can effectively preserve drug factors and prolong the half-life of drug release (18). Given these properties, we hypothesized that GelMA would retain and consistently release hUCMSC-Exos directly around the intravenous graft, thereby promoting endothelial cell functions and inhibiting intimal hyperplasia (19). To this end, we incorporated hUCMSC-Exos into GelMA, molded and wrapped it around the venous graft, and removed the blood vessels 28 d later. We then investigated whether the combination of exosomes and hydrogels could inhibit endovascular hyperplasia and improve hemodynamics in a rat model of venous transplantation."

Flow cytometry analysis revealed that the cells were positive for CD73,\nKeywords Intimal hyperplasia, Restenosis, Exosomes, Mesenchymal stem cells, Photosensitive hydrogel\nCD90, and CD105 but constantly negative for CD34, CD45, CD14, CD19 and HLA-DR, which is consistent with a previous report of hUCMSC characteristics (Fig.\u00a01b) (20). After two to three weeks of differentiation, the adipogenic and chondrogenic differentiation potential of hUCMSCs was confirmed by Alcian blue and Oil Red O staining (Fig.\u00a01c, d). Also, hUCMSCs had the ability to differentiate into osteoblasts (Fig.\u00a01e). The results showed that the cells used were hUCMSCs, which had the ability to differentiate. We then examined the morphology of the harvested exosomes using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Under TEM, hUCMSC-Exos were observed to be elliptical in shape and variable in size (Fig.\u00a01f ). By testing the particle sizes of exosomes, we determined that\ntheir diameter was approximately 150 \u00b1 77\u00a0 nm (Fig.\u00a0 1g). Furthermore, western blot analysis was performed to detect the expression of cluster of differentiation CD9, CD63, and CD81 (Fig.\u00a01h)."

            "text": "Both GelMA and GelMA-Exos were colorless and existed in a non-liquid form (Fig.\u00a02a). We evaluated the injectivity and viscosity of the hydrogel using a syringe (Fig.\u00a02b). The microstructures of GelMA and GelMA-Exos were observed using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) (Fig.\u00a0 2c). We found that GelMA has a relatively typical loose, porous structure. In the internal structure of GelMA-Exos, exosomes exhibit a scattered distribution. Fourier-transform infrared spectrophotometry was used to test the GelMA pure gel and GelMA-Exos after the introduction of exosomes. The Fourier spectra of the two groups overlapped considerably, and their peaks were not significantly different (Fig.\u00a0 2d). By analyzing the infrared absorption characteristic peaks of GelMA-Exos and GelMA, we found that there was no significant difference in the types and quantities of internal functional groups between them. This suggests that exosomes do not chemically react with the gels. We also characterized the pure GelMA gel and GelMA-Exos using X-ray diffraction and found that the peaks of the two sets of curves almost coincided, indicating that exosomes also had no effect on the internal hydrogel structure (Fig.\u00a02e). The rheological properties of GelMA and GelMA-Exos were examined. We found that the storage modulus (G\u2019) of GelMA-Exos was slightly higher than the loss modulus (G\u201d), like in the pure GelMA group, indicating that GelMA remains stable before and after the addition of exosomes. The rheological data show that the loss modulus exceeds the energy storage modulus only when the angular frequency is greater than 75\u00a0rad/s (Fig.\u00a02f ). Rats and normal people can only achieve a state of motion at a limited angular frequency; thus, the movement of water gel in rats or a normal person remains stable.\nDegradation of GelMA and GelMA-Exos in vivo and in vitro To analyze the degradation of the hydrogels in vitro, we steeped them in phosphate buffered saline (PBS), harvested them every five days, and weighed them. GelMA and GelMA-Exos had initial weights of 2.407 \u00b1 0.08\u00a0 mg and 2.370 \u00b1 0.04\u00a0 mg, respectively. We plotted the degradation curves of GelMA and GelMA-Exos in vitro and found no significant differences in the weights between GelMA and GelMA loaded with exosomes (Fig.\u00a0 3a). GelMA and GelMA-Exos with initial weights of 3.446 \u00b1 0.01\u00a0 mg and 3.248 \u00b1 0.00\u00a0 mg, respectively, were implanted under the skin of the mice\u2019s backs. Subsequently, GelMA was collected and weighed after 28 d of implantation in rats, and it was found that its weight\ndecreased slightly, with no significant difference being observed before and after GelMA was implanted in mice (Fig.\u00a0 3b and c). Similar results were found for GelMA-Exos."

            "text": "Flow cytometry was used to analyze the immune cells in the spleens of mice in each group (Fig.\u00a0 4a). No statistically significant difference was observed between the white blood cells, T lymphocytes, and macrophages in the spleen of mice in the GelMA-Exos group and those in the control group, suggesting that GelMA-Exos did not trigger immune rejection (Fig.\u00a04b). Hematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining results of different groups of heart tissues showed that the myocardial fibers were neatly arranged, the nucleus was clear and complete, and there were no obvious symptoms of apoptosis (Fig.\u00a0 4c). HE staining results of different groups of liver cells indicated that the cells were arranged closely and in order, the bile duct was clearly distributed, and no obvious fibrosis and necrosis were observed (Fig.\u00a04c). There was no significant inflammatory cell infiltration in the spleen of different groups after HE staining (Fig.\u00a04c). HE staining results of different groups of lungs showed that the alveoli in the lung tissue were round or oval, and the alveolar epithelial cells were regular and closely arranged (Fig.\u00a04c). HE staining showed that the renal structure as well as the glomerular size and shape were normal and the boundary was clear (Fig.\u00a04c). In summary, a comparison of the HE staining results of mice subcutaneously implanted with GelMA and GelMA-Exos in various organs demonstrated their non-toxicity in mice.\nRelease of GelMA-Exos and their uptake by human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) We also determined the controlled-release capacity of GelMA-Exos (Fig.\u00a05a). The release capacity of the hydrogels was determined by detecting the exosomes that had been released into the medium using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) protein assay kit. We found that GelMA-Exos were released from hydrogels in vitro continuously for approximately 18\u201321 d. Then, GelMA-Exos were co-cultured with HUVECs. HUVEC is a pebble-like cell whose characteristic surface antibodies include CD31 and von Willebrand factor (vWF) (Fig.\u00a0 5b). After incubation for 12\u00a0h, red fluorescent Paul Karl Horan (PKH)26 and green fluorescent CD63 double-dyed exosomes crossed the cell membrane into the cytoplasm of HUVECs and accumulated around the nucleus (Fig.\u00a05c).\nGelMA-Exos promote the migration and proliferation of HUVECs To assess HUVEC migration, a cell scratch assay was performed. As indicated in Fig.\u00a0 6a and b, the GelMA-Exos\ngroups showed significantly increased cell migration abilities compared to those in the GelMA hydrogel and PBS groups. To further explore the advantages of GelMA-Exos, we also performed a migration assay for more periods. The results showed that GelMA-Exos still had the ability to promote HUVEC migration after 21 d of immersion in PBS (Fig.\u00a0 6b). The results of the Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay also suggested that GelMA-Exos facilitated HUVEC proliferation, which was superior to that in the control and GelMA groups, indicating that the exosomes in the GelMA hydrogel could be partially released at an early stage and prolong their survival in vitro (Fig.\u00a06c). Moreover, we analyzed the effect of GelMA-Exos on HUVECs by performing annexin V flow cytometry (Fig.\u00a0 6d), and the results indicated that GelMA-Exos and the GelMA hydrogel did not increase HUVEC apoptosis (Fig.\u00a06e).\nGelMA-Exos inhibit intimal hyperplasia in venous grafts Our study constructed the jugular vein transplantation model and wrapped GelMA-Exos and GelMA around the vein graft (Fig.\u00a0 7a). hUCMSC-Exos were injected into rats through the tail vein. Echocardiography was\nperformed to examine the patency and effectiveness of the vein graft (Fig.\u00a0 7b). Venous grafts were collected approximately 30 d after the transplantation procedure, and the tube wall of the grafts became thicker, while the lumen became narrower. Masson and HE staining revealed that the intima and media of the vein grafts thickened at 28 d after surgery, and the smooth muscle cells in the media migrated and proliferated excessively, resulting in narrowing of the lumen of the vein grafts. To compare the degree of stenosis, we calculated the ratio of the lumen area to the total vessel area. HE and Masson staining showed that the degree of vascular stenosis was significantly reduced in the exosome group compared with that in the control group (P < 0.05, Fig.\u00a07c). The proportion of the vascular lumen area in the GelMA-Exos group was also significantly increased compared with that in the control (P < 0.05, Fig.\u00a07d) and GelMA (P < 0.05, Fig.\u00a07c) groups.\nDetection of the endothelial process using immunofluorescence To investigate whether hUCMSC-Exos and GelMAExos could promote endothelial growth, we performed\nimmunofluorescence analysis of endothelial cell surface markers CD31 at 28 d after vein graft. The GelMA-Exos and exosome groups showed positive immunofluorescence staining for CD31 along the lumen of the venous graft (Fig.\u00a0 8a). Immunofluorescence showed that the length of the lumen wall in the GelMA-Exos group was mostly covered by CD31-positive cells, indicating that the degree of reendothelialization is the highest in this group (Fig.\u00a08b). Moreover, western blot analysis of CD31positive cells from different groups of venous grafts suggested that CD31 expression levels in the GelMAExos group were higher than those in the control group (Fig.\u00a08c). Simultaneously, we also found that the reendothelialization effect of GelMA-Exos was the best among the groups. Furthermore, we investigated the expression of smooth muscle alpha-actin (\u03b1-SMA) (Fig.\u00a0 9a) and proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) (Fig.\u00a0 9b) in each group of venous grafts via immunofluorescence. The results indicated that the fluorescence intensities of \u03b1-SMA (Fig.\u00a0 9c) in the GelMA-Exos group were lower than those in the control group. Key regulatory pathways associated with the reendothelialization of venous grafts For each dataset, we converted the miRNA expression data from counts to transcript per million (TPM) values, averaged the miRNA expression in the sample, sorted the mean value from largest to smallest, and selected miRNAs with expression levels in the top 100. To make the results more reliable, we considered the intersection of the top 100 miRNAs of the three datasets, resulting in a total of 39 miRNAs (Fig.\u00a010a). These 39 miRNAs were considered to have a leading role in the effects of hUCMSC-Exos and were used for subsequent studies. In this study, two algorithms, miRWalk2 and Starbase2, were used to predict messenger RNA (mRNA)\u2013miRNA interactions. For miRWalk2, we screened the miRNA\u2013 mRNA interactions predicted using both TargetScan and\nmiRDB. For Starbase2, we screened for miRNA\u2013mRNA interactions using the following parameters: clipExpNum \u2265 10, predicted sum > 5, and pancancerNum > 5. We compared the mRNA predicted by the two algorithms and obtained 170 mRNAs (Fig.\u00a010b).\nGene Ontology (GO) function and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway enrichment analyses of 170 mRNAs were performed. For the GO analysis, we selected the top 10 terms for the presentation (Fig.\u00a010c). For the KEGG analysis, we selected channels with a gene count \u2265 5 to display the bubble map (Fig.\u00a010d). Finally, we used the Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) database to predict the interactions among the 170 genes, and Cytoscape (3.6.1)was used to visualize miRNA\u2013mRNA\nand mRNA\u2013mRNA interactions (Fig.\u00a010e). In this study, we found that signaling pathways related to cell migration and proliferation, including p53, phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)\u2013AKT, and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), might play important roles in the effects on endothelial cells. Furthermore, we found evidence of increased p-mTOR and p-AKT protein expression in the rat vein transplantation model (Fig.\u00a0 10f ). According to Western-blot calculation by ImageJ software, we found that the expression levels of AKT and mTOR proteins in each group were similar, suggesting that the AKT-mTOR signaling pathway may be involved in the regulation of endothelial cell function (Fig.\u00a010f )."

            "text": "Venous graft restenosis after coronary artery bypass transplantation is mostly generated by intimal hyperplasia (IH), which is a key problem that needs to be addressed (21). After heart bypass surgery, the venous grafts are subject to complex physiological changes. First, the structure and function of endothelial cells are impaired, inflammatory factors are released, and white blood cells and platelets accumulate in this area (1). Subsequently, vascular smooth muscle cells proliferate and migrate to the graft vessels to adapt to the increased vascular shear stress. This process is accompanied by a sharp decrease in the expression levels of various vasodilator factors and nitric oxide (22). Without the protection of endothelial cells, the smooth muscle, directly exposed to the blood, will proliferate excessively under the stimulation of inflammatory factors, resulting in stenosis of the graft lumen (23). Therefore, repairing and maintaining the function of vascular endothelial cells acts as a pivotal role in inhibiting IH in the early and middle stages of vein transplantation. MSCs are a prospective treatment option for tissue repair and regeneration in various cardiovascular diseases (24). In addition, there is increasing evidence that stem cell therapy is effective through signal transduction pathways mediated by EVs (25). Exosomes contain a variety of small molecules that carry biological information, such as miRNA and proteins, which are the core substances mediating intercellular communication and can even regulate cells of different species (26). Currently, the therapeutic efficacy of stem cell-derived exosomes has been demonstrated in various animal disease models (27). However, the rapid clearance and easy destruction of exosomes limit their application in some disease models. It is possible to promote the application of exosomes in disease models based on the development and\nutilization of various biological materials (28). Several studies have applied injectable hydrogels and exosomes to various disease models, such as intervertebral disc degeneration and cartilage regeneration, because hydrogels can effectively protect and prolong the half-life and function of exosomes in the body (29).\nIn this study, GelMA was combined with hUCMSC exosomes and applied to a rat vein graft model to inhibit graft restenosis. Moreover, our study also demonstrated that hUCMSC-Exos might stimulate the proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells by activating mTOR and PI3K\u2013AKT signaling pathways. After the completion of gel synthesis, the surface of GelMA was observed using SEM and was found to be smooth. GelMA also preserved and prolonged the release of exosomes. Moreover, GelMA-Exos did not stimulate the spleen with an increase in immune cells in mice, demonstrating that GelMA-Exos did not elicit an immune response. The biological safety of GelMA-Exos was further confirmed by the HE staining results of the main internal organs in mice. Masson staining of the blood vessels in the graft specimens showed that the stenosis was eccentric and uneven. Furthermore, we confirmed the increased expression of \u03b1-SMA in vein grafts via immunofluorescence. Notably, we also observed increased expression of the endothelial cell-specific antigen CD31 in the GelMA-Exos and Exo groups using an immunofluorescence assay. The results of these experiments all proved that wrapping GelMA-Exos around the venous graft achieved the best effect of inhibiting restenosis.\nEndothelial cell layer can maintain the integrity of the vessel wall by providing a barrier function, limiting SMC proliferation and migration, and promoting blood vessels to protect the medium, such as through nitric oxide synthesis, which is very important (30). Therefore, the enhanced reendothelialization of the damaged vein can effectively prevent lumen stenosis of the vein graft, and the process of reendothelialization mainly depends on the migration and proliferation of vascular endothelial cells (31). In vitro cell experiments and membrane dye labeling demonstrated that hUCMSC-Exos could be released from GelMA-Exos and be taken up by HUVECs. This is compatible with the results of Liang\u2019s studies, suggesting that exosomes secreted by fat-derived MSCs are taken up by HUVECs (3). Previous studies have shown that hUCMSC-Exos mediate the expression of vascular endothelial growth factors in endothelial cells through mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)\u2013extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 (ERK1/2) signaling pathways, thereby promoting reendothelialization (19). To further study the regulatory mechanism underlying the effects of hUCMSC-Exos on endothelial cells, we downloaded three datasets from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database, screened miRNAs that might play a\nmajor role, and analyzed and verified the possible regulatory mechanisms, including the mTOR and PI3K\u2013AKT signaling pathways. Other studies have also reported that the PI3K\u2013AKT\u2013mTOR pathway is vital for cell proliferation and apoptosis (32). Pei et al. pointed out that activation of the PI3K\u2013AKT\u2013mTOR signaling pathway can promote angiogenesis and endothelial cell functions (33). Further, Liang et al. indicated that human bone marrow MSC-derived exosomes target angiogenesis and promote bone regeneration via the AKT/mTOR pathway (34). In our study, we detected increased expression of phospho(p)-AKT and p-mTOR in the experimental group, suggesting that the PI3\u2013AKT\u2013mTOR signaling pathway can be activated by hUCMSC-derived exosomes.\nWe also unexpectedly found that the GelMA hydrogel, applied alone around venous grafts, could inhibit the intimal hyperplasia of blood vessels. This could be related to the mechanical properties and external support provided by the GelMA hydrogel. Hydrogels with mechanical properties can act as \u201cextravascular scaffolds\u201d for venous grafts, effectively limiting the overdilation of vascular bridges and hemodynamic changes (35). External vascular stents not only effectively prevent venous graft expansion but also regulate the shear stress of venous blood vessel walls, thus inhibiting intimal hyperplasia (36). Moreover, by limiting graft overdistension, the diameter of the venous graft can match the artery, thus keeping the blood flow rate stable and reducing the blood turbulence (37). This can significantly improve the intimal hyperplasia caused by hemodynamic disorders. Another benefit of extravascular stents is the promotion of angiogenesis around transplanted veins. When macroporous and loose-fitting stents are used, several neovascularization events can be observed around the transplanted vein (38). Currently, only a few extravascular stents can be applied in clinical practice, whereas the application of most extravascular stents is still in its infancy. Considering their convenience and practicality for clinical applications, extravascular scaffolds made of light-cured hydrogels are a promising therapeutic option. Hydrogel scaffolds loaded with traditional Chinese herbs, such as Bletilla and Astragalus membranaceus, have also been reported for the treatment of the restenosis of grafts, and good progress has been made (39).\nOur study has certain limitations. First, the rat model of venous transplantation cannot fully simulate the complex physiological conditions that could occur after coronary artery bypass transplantation. Second, we need to elucidate the specific mechanisms and pathways involved in the regulation of vascular endothelial cell proliferation and migration mediated by hUCMSC exosomes or other intervening exosomes. Third, the exosomes used in this paper are of insufficient purity, and there may be a small number of microvesicles larger than 150\u00a0nm in diameter.\nFinally, extensive clinical trials are required to evaluate the biosafety of GelMA-Exos."

            "text": "In summary, we constructed a complex comprising hUCMSC-Exos and a GelMA photosensitive hydrogel that can be used to inhibit restenosis in venous grafts and extend their service life. GelMA can carry exosomes and control their slow release, promoting endothelial cell proliferation in the intima of venous grafts, thereby causing \u201creendothelialization\u201d to prevent early intima proliferation. Bioinformatics analysis and western blotting showed that hUCMSCs-Exos may regulate the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells by activating the PI3-AKT-mTOR pathway. The application of GelMAExos composites did not cause immune rejection or toxicity in various organs (heart, liver, lung, and kidney) in the mouse models. Therefore, this biomaterial-based exosome therapy is a promising treatment for vein graft restenosis."
