The symmergent gravity, an emergent gravity model in which gravity emerges in a way restoring the gauge symmetries and stabilizing the Higgs boson mass, possesses a quadratic-curvature term with a loop-induced coupling proportional to the boson-fermion number difference. We investigated bosonfermion number difference and black hole parameters in symmergent gravity by utilizing the values of various observables. In this regard, we investigated particle dynamics and obtained Keplerian frequencies describing the harmonic oscillations. We determined quasiperiodic oscillations about such orbits by utilizing relativistic precession, warped disk, and epicyclic resonant models. We studied weak deflection angle and planetary perihelion shift and determined bounds on symmergent gravity parameters. We computed shadow radius for both static and co-moving observers near and far from the symmergent black hole and revealed the sensitivity of these observers to the model parameters. We conclude the work by giving an overall discussion of the bounds, and giving future prospects concerning other possible analyses of the symmergent gravity.\nPACS numbers: 04.50.-h, 04.40.Dg, 97.60.Gb Keywords: Black hole; Quasiperiodic oscillations; Deflection angle; Shadow; X-ray binaries\nI. INTRODUCTION\nBlack holes, whose horizons are defined as the shell of the points of no return, are one of the most fundamental predictions of general relativity (GR). The first direct detection of gravitational waves in 2015 by the LIGOVirgo collaboration [1] and the first-ever observation of an image of the black hole in 2019 by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) [2, 3] signaled the start of a new era in gravitational physics. These experiments open up a new methodology to test theories of gravity in the strong field (high curvature) domains.\nIn the present work, we will test a recent emergent gravity model in appropriate black hole spacetimes. In general, the reconciliation of quantum matter and gravitation is a thorny fundamental problem, and one plausible approach is provided by emergent gravity models\n\u2217Electronic address: javlon@astrin.uz \u2020Electronic address: reggie.pantig@dlsu.edu.ph \u2021Electronic address: ali.ovgun@emu.edu.tr \u00a7Electronic address: ahmadjon@astrin.uz \u00b6Electronic address: durmus.demir@sabanciuniv.edu\n[4\u20136]. Indeed, quantum field theories (QFT) by formulation are intrinsic to flat spacetime [7, 8] because they rest on a unique Poincare\u0301-invariant vacuum state. Flat spacetime means the sheer absence of gravity. The incorporation of gravity requires QFT to be taken to curved spacetime. This, however, is simply impossible because Poincare\u0301 symmetry gets broken in curved geometry and special states like vacuum get banned by general covariance [8, 9]. In view of this impasse and view also of the absence of a quantum theory of gravity [10], one is left with essentially emergent gravity [4, 5] as the most plausible option. In recent years, Sakharov\u2019s setup has been extended by the inclusion of gauge sector [11], and it has been shown [11], that gravity could emerge in a way erasing loop-induced gauge boson masses and stabilizing scalar masses, which leads to the naturalization of the effective field theories regarding their sensitivities to high scales [12, 13]. This mechanism leads to a new framework [11, 14] in which one obtains the usual Einstein gravity (Einstein-Hilbert term) plus quadratic curvature terms plus a MS-renormalized QFT. It possesses sui generis features that can be searched at the collider, astrophysical and cosmological experiments and observations. This emergent gravity, termed as \u201csymmerar X iv :2 20 6.\n06 59\n9v 1\n[ gr\n-q c]\n1 4\nJu n\n20 22\n2 gent gravity\u201d for its gauge symmetry-restoring nature [14, 15], has all its couplings induced by the flat spacetime quantum loops. Symmergent gravity is not an effective field theory constructed in curved spacetime [5, 16]. It is, in fact, flat spacetime effective field theory taken to curved spacetime in a way restoring gauge symmetries [11, 14]. Its various couplings are related to the flat spacetime QFT so that its curvature sector enables one to extract information about the particle spectrum, mass spectrum, and other details of the QFT. Since the new particles do not have to couple to the already known particles, one ends up with a wide spectrum of masses and couplings [11, 17]. As a matter of fact, quadratic curvature terms in symmergent gravity, different from those in the other approaches [5, 16], have been shown to lead to successful Starobinsky inflation [18]. In addition, the same quadratic curvature terms have recently been shown to give distinctive signatures on black hole shadow [19]. In the present work, we shall probe the symmergent gravity model in the quasiperiodic oscillations, weak field lensing, and shadow cast around the black holes. Our work can be viewed are \u201cdoing particle physics via black hole properties\u201d as it will reveal salient features of the QFT sector through various black hole features.\nSince the verification of the GR as the relativistic theory of gravity by Eddington in 1919, gravitational lensing has remained one of the main tools for observing and understanding various phenomena in astronomy and cosmology (like galaxies, dark matter, dark energy and the evolution of the Universe [20]). Over the decades, various methods have been devised to calculate the deflection angle by black holes [21\u201328]. In 2008, Gibbons and Werner devised a different method to determine the deflection angle in weak fields using the Gauss-Bonnet theorem (GBT) on the optical geometries in asymptotically flat spacetimes [29]. To achieve this, the GBT needs to be integrated into an infinite domain bounded by the light ray. This method has been applied to various related phenomena [30\u201339]. In Werner\u2019s work [40], for instance, the GBT method for deflection angle was extended to stationary spacetimes in the Finsler-Randers type optical geometry on Nazim\u2019s osculating Riemannian manifolds. Following this, Ishihara and others have found a way to apply the GBT method to finite-distances differently than the use of asymptotic receiver and source [41, 42]. Next, Ono and others have extended Ishihara method to axisymmetric spacetimes [43], with further applications to various non-asymptotic spacetimes, such as those with dark matter contributions in their metric function [44\u201347]. Finally, the finite distance method has been studied by Li and others by using massive particles and Jacobi-Maupertuis Randers-Finsler metric within the GBT [48, 49].\nRecently, an eloquent step has been taken to probe black hole models in modified gravity theories with the EHT, which has showcased the first image (a 2D dark\nzone) of the supermassive black hole M87* [2, 3]. Black holes have a dark region as seen from the observer in the celestial sky, which is known as the BH shadow. It can reveal a fine structure near the horizon of the black hole, and can therefore be used to test gravity theories in the strong gravity regime. Black hole shadow was first studied by Synge in 1966 for the specific case of the Schwarzschild black hole [50]. After Synge, in 1979, Luminet gave the formula for the angular radius of the shadow [51]. It is well known that the shadow of a nonrotating black hole is just a standard circle. The shadow of a rotating black hole, on the other hand, is an elongated shape in the direction of rotation. To this end, theoretically-predicted shadow sizes of various black hole solutions have been contrasted with the 2017 measurements of M87* and various constraints have been put using the data. The shadows of modified gravity black holes are smaller and distorted compared to the shadow of the Kerr black hole. Black hole properties have been analysed by various recent works which focus on the black hole shadow cast [52\u201367, 67\u201397].\nThere appears a series of peaks in the radio to Xray band of the electromagnetic spectrum from astrophysical objects. These peaks are signatures of the quasi-periodic oscillations (QPOs). One observes QPOs with more than two peaks in low-mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) such that at least one compact object in the binary is a neutron star [98\u2013100]. In particular, most of the microquasars reveal twin-peak QPOs in their electromagnetic spectrum. The nature of these peaks is related to the process of matter accretion into the compact objects [101\u2013104]. It turns out that the twin-peak QPOs and QPOs with more than two peaks are different in nature. In fact, various proposed models describe them as two types of QPOs [105, 106]. The observation and analysis of the twin-peak QPOs in microquasars could be a useful tool to test different properties of neutron stars and black holes such as their magnetic fields, accretion disk properties, and the underlying gravity models [107\u2013109]. On the other side, depending on the frequencies, one may distinguish two types of QPOs: (i) highfrequency (HF) QPOs corresponding to the frequency range from 0.1 to 1 kHz, and (ii) low-frequency (LF) QPOs corresponding to the frequency less than 0.1 kHz.\nIt is worth noting that there have been numerous proposals for describing the QPOs. Despite this, those proposals are not able to take into account all the astrophysical variables in the description of QPOs. Numerous observations and their detailed analyses indicate that QPOs are related to the dynamics of the test particles around the black holes, in particular, to their harmonic oscillations in the radial, vertical and azimuthal directions. Analyzing the dynamics of these test particles, especially their orbital motions and oscillations, one may test the gravity theories as well as spacetime properties around compact objects through observational data on QPOs [110\u2013120]. Studies of models of QPOs in view of the orbital motions of the test particles enable the study\n3 of the innermost stable circular orbit (ISCO) of the particles [121\u2013123].\nIn this paper, as mentioned before, we will perform a detailed test study of the symmergent gravity in the strong field (high-curvature) domains using the EHT observations [2, 3]. We will determine, in particular, the implications of the symmergent gravity setup for the quasi-periodic oscillations, weak field lensing, and shadow cast around the black holes. The paper is organized as follows: In Sec. II, a summary is given of the symmergent gravity model with emphasis on its gravity (curvature) sector and associated model parameters. Sec. III is devoted to study of the dynamics of test particles. The fundamental frequencies due to Keplerian orbits and harmonic oscillations are discussed in Sec. IV. In Sec. V, orbits of quasiperiodic oscillations are explored, and the results of this exploration are used in Sec. VI to determine the constraints on the parameters of the symmergent gravity. Further examination of the effects of these parameters is performed through the study of the weak deflection angle in Sec. VII, and the shadow cast in Sec. VIII. We close the paper with a Conclusion section in which we give a summary and discuss future prospects regarding the topics covered.\nEn passant, we note that in this paper we use geometrized (natural) units G = 1, c = 1 and (\u2212,+,+,+) metric signature."

            "text": "Symmergent gravity is a quadratic-curvature gravity. It is a subclass of f(R) gravity theories. This special emergent gravity theory has been discussed in detail in [11] (see also [14, 15] for earlier analyses). The latest detailed discussion of the symmergent gravity was given in [19] while analyzing its implications for black hole shadow. This introductory black hole article gives all the basic aspects of symmergent gravity. Below, we summarize symmergent gravity in view of the required parameters and relevant features of the model (and kindly refer the reader to [11, 19] for other details).\nThe symmergent gravity is governed by the action\u222b d4x \u221a \u2212g { R(g)\n16\u03c0G + cS 4 S2R(g)\u2212 cO 16 R(g)2\n} (1)\nin which R(g) is the scalar curvature and ci\u2019s, and GN are loop induced quantities, that is, quantities produced by flat spacetime matter loops. Here S is a generic scalar field, including the SM Higgs field. Two relevant parameters are given by,\n1 G =\nstr [ M2 ] 8\u03c0 , cO = nB \u2212 nF 128\u03c02 , (2)\nwhere nB (nF) stands for the total number of bosons (fermions) in Nature. The nB bosons plus nF fermions involve the known particles (quarks, leptons, photon,\ngluon and weak bosons) as well as completely new particles (massive as well as massless) that do not have to couple to the known particles non-gravitationally. The graded trace str[M2] = \u2211 s(\u22121)s tr[M2]s, s being the particle spin, is a sum over the mass-suqared matrixM2 of fields. The constant cS is around 0.019 when S is the usual Higgs field [11, 14], and can take on different values for different scalars beyond the SM.\nThe curvature sector of the symmergent gravity, as follows from the action (1), contains linear and quadratic curvature terms. Their coefficients are loop-induced quantities defined in (2). The theory is a special case of generic f(R) gravity theories, where instead of the standard Einstein-Hilbert action with a linear curvature, R(g) the theory contains a covariant function of the curvature f(R) as\nS = 1\n16\u03c0G\n\u222b d4x \u221a \u2212g(R\u2212 \u03c0GcOR2) , (3)\nafter leaving aside the irrelevant scalar field sector. This action leads to the equations of motion\nR\u00b5\u03bdF (R)\u2212 1\n2 g\u00b5\u03bd f (R) + [g\u00b5\u03bd \u2212\u2207\u00b5\u2207\u03bd ]F (R) = 0 , (4)\nwhere is the d\u2019Alembertian operator, and\nF (R) = df(R)\ndR = 1\u2212 2\u03c0GcOR (5)\nis the derivative of f(R) with respect to its argument. Making use of its trace, equation (4) leads to a traceless motion equation\nR\u00b5\u03bdF (R)\u2212 g\u00b5\u03bd 4 RF (R) + g\u00b5\u03bd 4 F (R)\u2212\u2207\u00b5\u2207\u03bdF (R) = 0(6)\nwhose solution is directly tied to the loop factors G and cO, and thus, varies with the particle spectrum of the underlying QFT. Now, using the ansatz,\nF [R(r)] = a+ br (7)\nthe geometry of the black hole spacetime in spherical coordinates x\u03b1 = {t, r, \u03b8, \u03c6} is found to have the form\nds2 = \u2212f(r)dt2 + 1 f(r)\ndr2 + r2 ( d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62 ) , (8)\nwith the lapse function\nf(r) = 1\u2212 2GM r + a\u2212 1 24\u03c0GcO r2 (9)\nbecoming the Schwarzschild black hole spacetime when a \u2192 1 or/and cO \u2192 \u221e. From now on, we set G = 1. We plot the lapse function in Fig. 1 as a function of r/M . For the Schwarzschild case, rh = 2M and hence f(rh) = 0. Inclusion symmergent gravity parameters makes the horizon shift slightly toward or away from\n4\nthe Schwarzschild case. In Figure 1, full curves correspond to cO < 0, and mimic an AdS (cO < 0\u21d2 nB < nF) behaviour. The dashed curves, on the other hand, correspond to cO > 0, mimic a dS (cO > 0 \u21d2 nB > nF) structure, and develop a second horizon at large r. We observe that as r/M gets too large, deviation from the Schwarzschild case is pronounced."

The black, blue and red curves correspond, respectively, to the solutions r1, r2, r3 for both a > 1 and a < 1 ranges. In fact, numerical and graphical analyses show that one can distinguish various types of horizons depending on the values of a and cO (see Figure 2):\n\u2022 The root r1 comes to mean the inner (Cauchy) horizon for cO > 0 and cosmological-like horizon for\ncO < 0 & a > 1.

            "text": "Here, we study the dynamics of test particles in the spacetime of static black holes in symmergent gravity. In order to derive the integrals of motion, we start with\nthe Lagrangian of the test particles\nL = 1\n2 mg\u00b5\u03bd x\u0307\n\u00b5x\u0307\u03bd , (13)\nin which m stands for the masses of the test particles, x\u00b5(\u03c4) denotes their worldlines, and x\u0307\u00b5 = dx\u00b5/d\u03c4 gives their four-velocities.\nSince the metric tensor (8) is independent of time t and azimuthal coordinate \u03c6, there arise two conserved quantities:\ngttt\u0307 = \u2212E , g\u03c6\u03c6\u03c6\u0307 = L, (14)\nwhere E = E/m and L = L/m are the specific energy and angular momentum of the particle of mass m, respectively. One can use the following normalization condition to govern the equations of motion for test particles:\ng\u00b5\u03bd x\u0307 \u00b5x\u0307\u03bd = (15)\nin which = 0 corresponds to massless particles with null geodesics, and = \u22121 corresponds to massive particles with time-like geodesics. The equation of motion for particles with non-zero mass can be expressed as [124\u2013126]\nt\u0307 = \u2212 E gtt , (16)\nr\u0307 = \u221a E2 + gtt ( 1 + K r2 ) , (17)\n\u03b8\u0307 = 1\ng\u03b8\u03b8\n\u221a K \u2212 L 2\nsin2 \u03b8 , (18)\n\u03c6\u0307 = L g\u03c6\u03c6 , (19)\nin which K is the Carter constant, corresponding to the total angular momentum of the particle. Specializing to the equatorial motion of the particles with \u03b8 = \u03c0/2 and \u03b8\u0307 = 0, one is led toK = L2. In consequence, test particles assume the following radial motion equation,\nr\u03072 = E2 \u2212 Veff(r) , (20)\nwhere the effective potential\nVeff(r) = f(r)\n( 1 + L2\nr2\n) (21)\nencodes effects of rotational dynamics via the motion integral L.

A judicious numerical analysis can reveal physics implications of the lengthy analytic solution in (26). To this end, depicted in Figure 7 are the positive real solutions of (25) for both a < 1 and a > 1 regimes. Indeed, black, red and blue lines correspond, respectively, to r2, r3 and r4. Our numerical analysis shows that r1 takes on negative value for all values of a and cO. Also, it is observed from the figure and obtained from our numerical analyses that, r2 and r3 correspond to ISCO at a > 1 & cO < 0 and a < 1 & cO > 0, respectively. The root r4, on the other hand, corresponds to the outermost stable circular orbit (OSCO) and coincides with ISCO at critical values of the parameter cO. It is clear that ISCO radius increases (decreases) with the increase of the parameter cO at a > 1 (a < 1). In other words, ISCO and OSCO come close (go apart) depending on a and cO. These features are depicted in Fig. 8 in which values of the a parameter are evenly sampled around the unity."

            "heading": "V. TWIN-PEAK QPOS AROUND SYMMERGENT BLACK HOLES",
            "text": "In general, QPOs refer to juddering of the light rays from astronomical objects about certain frequencies. As an illustrative case, QPOs in (micro)quasars have come into view in relation to the fundamental frequencies of the particles orbiting the black hole at the center of the (micro)quasar. The main point is that the frequencies of QPOs depend on the spacetime geometry in the black hole environment.\nIn this section, we explore the upper and lower frequencies of twin-peaked QPOs in the framework of symmergent gravity. Here, the twin-peak QPOs are picked up on the basis of probing the symmergent gravity parameters. In general, the upper and lower frequencies are described in different ways by the frequencies of the radial, vertical and orbital oscillations:\n\u2022 The relativistic precession (RP) model has been first proposed in Ref. [103] to explain the physical mechanism behind kHz twin-peak QPOs in the frequency range 0.2 to 1.25 kHz from neutron stars in LMXRBs. It has been shown that the RP model applies also to black hole candidates in the binary systems of black holes and neutron stars [128]. Furthermore, an RP model has been developed in [129] to obtain mass and spin measurements of black holes at the center of microquasars using the data from the accretion disk power-density spectrum. The upper and lower frequencies in the RP model are given by the fundamental oscillation frequencies \u03bdU = \u03bd\u03c6 and \u03bdL = \u03bd\u03c6\u2212\u03bdr, respectively.\n9 \u2022 The epicyclic resonance (ER) model is based on the resonances in the axisymmetric oscillation modes in the accretion disc of black holes [130]. It has been shown that the disc oscillation modes are related to the frequencies of (quasi) harmonic oscillations of the circular geodesics of the test particles. Here, we consider two special cases of the ER model: ER2 and ER3. They differ from each other by their oscillation modes. ER2 has the classes of the upper and lower frequencies \u03bdU = 2\u03bd\u03b8 \u2212 \u03bdr & \u03bdL = \u03bdr as well as \u03bdU = \u03bd\u03b8 + \u03bdr & \u03bdL = \u03bd\u03b8. ER3, on the other hand, has only one class of the upper and lower frequencies \u03bdU = \u03bd\u03b8 + \u03bdr & \u03bdL = \u03bd\u03b8 \u2212 \u03bdr [130].\n\u2022 The warped disc (WD) model is structured upon the non-axisymmetric modes of the oscillations of the accretion disc around the black holes and neutron stars [131, 132]. According to the WD model assumptions, the upper and lower frequencies are \u03bdU = 2\u03bd\u03c6 \u2212 \u03bdr, \u03bdL = 2(\u03bd\u03c6 \u2212 \u03bdr), and vertical oscillations gives cause to a thin accretion disc to be warped [131, 132].\nNow, using the three models mentioned above, we analyze possible upper and lower frequencies of the twinpeaked QPOs. These frequencies are generated by the flickering of the test particles in their stable circular orbits around symmergent black holes.\nPossible values of the upper and lower frequencies of twin-peak QPOs around a symmergent gravity black hole are plotted in Figure 10 for the RP, WD, ER2, and ER3 models. The inclined blue-solid \u03bdU = \u03bdL line is the deadline for twin-peak QPOs since their two peaks coincide for \u03bdU = \u03bdL. The light-blue shaded area is the graveyard for twin-peak QPOs in that no such QPOs can be observed in this domain of \u03bdU and \u03bdL. It is observed from the figure that no low-frequency twin peak QPOs occur. This is due to the presence of a non-zero a parameter because for a < 1 ratios of the frequencies slightly increase but, for a > 1, the same ratios decrease compared to the Schwarzschild case (a = 1). It is also observed from the ER2 and ER3 models that two different QPOs could be observed with similar frequency ratios for upper (lower) frequencies above 450 Hz (250 Hz). Frequency degeneracies as such are observed also at low-frequency twin-peak QPOs around 100 Hz in the RP and WD models (similar low-frequency behavior occurs between 100-200 Hz in the ER3 model)."

Thus, we will solve them numerically and analyze the effects of symmergent gravity on the QPOs graphically in the frameworks of the RP, WD, ER2 and ER3 models.\nIllustrated in Fig. 11 are the radii of the QPO orbits as a function of the parameter cO for a = 0.95 and a = 1.05 in the QPO models of RP (upper-left panel), WD (upper-right panel), ER2 (lower-left panel) and ER3 (upper-right panel). In each case, we indicate the OSCO and ISCO orbits, as well as the inner and outer QPO orbits. The QPO orbits are located outside the ISCOs and inside the OSCOs. As was mentioned in Fig. 7, the accretion disc is limited by ISCO and OSCO. In Fig.11, too, we have found that the outer border in the orbits of QPOs is due to the presence of the symmergent gravity parameters a and cO. It follows from the figure that QPO orbits are located near ISCOs/OSCOs in the RP and ER3 models. In the ER2 and WD models, however, QPO orbits are located away from the ISCOs/OSCOs. In general, ISCOs are one of the most important features of the black holes, and their determinations by astrophysical observations are a major issue. To this end, this issue can be resolved by the QPO studies in the RP and ER3 models. Our numerical calculations show that the distance between the QPOs orbits (with the ratio 5:4) and ISCO consists of the ISCO radii less than 5-7 % in RP and ER3 models when a = 0.95 and a = 1.05. It is around the error sizes in astrophysical observations, and one can take therefore the RP and ER3 QPO orbits as ISCOs."

To this aim, we explore weak deflection angle as a sensitive probe of the loop factor cO. The GBT is expressed as [29]\n\u222b\u222b T KdS + N\u2211 a=1 \u222b \u2202Ta \u03bagd`+ N\u2211 a=1 \u03b8a = 2\u03c0, (39)\nin which T is a two-dimensional orientable surface with boundaries \u2202Ta (a = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N ) that are differentiable curves, \u03b8a (a = 1, 2, \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 , N ) denote jump angles, K denotes the Gaussian curvature of the surface T , dS is the area element of the surface, \u03bag means the geodesic curvature of \u2202Ta, and ` is the line element along the boundary. By applying this fundamental formula to the quadrilateral \u221eR \u221e S , which consists of the spatial curve for the light ray, two outgoing radial lines from R and S and a circular arc segment Cr of coordinate radius rC (rC \u2192\u221e) centered at the lens L which intersects the ra-\ndial lines through the receiver or the source, Ishihara et al. [41] obtained the formula\n\u03b1 = \u03a8R \u2212\u03a8S + \u03c6RS = \u2212 \u222b\u222b\n\u221e R \u221e S\nKdS (40)\nfrom which it follows that \u03b1 is an invariant and remains well-defined even if L is a singularity point since the domain \u221eR \u221e S does not contain the point L. It follows that \u03b1 = 0 in Euclidean space. This is because K vanishes in Euclidean space, and the area integral of K thus vanishes. Furthermore, (40) proves useful for asymptotically flat spacetimes, and cannot be applied to non-asymptotically flat ones that have the metric (lapse) function in Eq. (9).\nTo solve this problem, Ishihara and others [41] used the main definition \u03a8R \u2212 \u03a8S + \u03c6RS in Eq.

This apparent divergence implies that the symmergent black hole does not allow r \u2192 \u221e (u \u2192 0) limit. In spite of this, it is possible to regularize \u03b1\u0302 by choosing u small yet finite (in accordance with the realistic situations) so that the formula (49) takes its small-u apporximate form\n\u03b1 = 4M\nb + (a\u2212 1)b 48\u03c0cO\n( 1\nuS +\n1\nuR\n) \u2212 (a\u2212 1)bM\n24\u03c0cO .

The left-panel shows the exact formula (49) as a function of the impact parameter b for nearby observers (uR = uS = 0.5/b), with the parameter values a = 0.9 and cO/M\n2 = \u00b11.99 and \u00b13.98. The right-panel of Figure 13, on the other hand, shows the small-u limit in (50) as a function of the impact parameter b for faraway observers (uR = uS = 0.02/b), with the parameter values a = 0.9 and cO/M2 = \u00b11.99 and \u00b13.98. In both panels, the Schwarzschild case (black curve) decreases monotonically as b/M \u2192 \u221e. It is observed that cO > 0 (cO < 0) mimics the dS (AdS) behaviour. This comes to mean that nB > nF (nB < nF) leads to dS (AdS) behaviours. Interestingly, for an observer near the black hole, when b/M \u2192 bcrit/M , \u03b1\u0302 remains below the\nSchwarzschild deflection angle such that the AdS case (cO < 0 \u21d2 nB < nF) stays slightly higher. At high values of b/M , the AdS (dS) case leads to an increasing (decreasing and vanishing) \u03b1\u0302. Meanwhile, an observer far from the black hole perceives a higher value for \u03b1\u0302 around bcrit/M for the AdS case. Clearly, \u03b1\u0302 does not exist at all in the dS case, even for low values of b/M . These two panels reveal the effects of a and cO on the deflection angle. Here, we remark that negative deflection angle in the dS (cO > 0 \u21d2 nB > nF) case comes to mean that at such values of b/M the photons are repelled. There are certain cases where repulsive deflection can also happen [140]. Nonetheless, one notes that negative deflection angle does not produce the Einstein ring, as we shall see in the next discussion.\nThe weak deflection angle has direct application in a phenomenon called Einstein ring. Here, we will determine the effects of the symmergent gravity parameters on the Einstein ring. To begin with, let us define the distance of the source and the receiver with respect to the lensing object as dS and, dR respectively. Through the thin lens equation, we then have dRS = dS + dR so that the position of the weak field images is given by [28]\ndRS tan\u03b2 = dR sin \u03b8 \u2212 dS sin(\u03b1\u0302\u2212 \u03b8)\ncos(\u03b1\u0302\u2212 \u03b8) . (51)\nIt is well known that an Einstein ring is formed when \u03b2 = 0, and the above equation leads then to the angular radius [21\u201326]\n\u03b8E \u2248 dS dRS \u03b1\u0302. (52)\nIn addition, since the Einstein ring is assumed to be small it is safe to take relation b = dR sin \u03b8 \u223c dR\u03b8. Then, the weak deflection angle (52) takes the explicit form\n\u03b8E \u2248\n\u221a dS\ndRSdR\n[ 4M +\n(a\u2212 1)(dS + dR) 48\u03c0 \u2212 (a\u2212 1)M 24\u03c0 ] (53)\nafter introducing = b2/cO. This angular radius is depicted in Figure 14 as a function of the impact parameter for a = 0.9 and cO/M2 = \u00b11.99 and\u00b13.98. This plot corresponds to the right-panel in Figure 13. The sensitivity of the Einstein ring to the model parameters ensures that it can be used to probe the symmergent gravity framework.\nLet us now consider Sgr A*. Our location is dR \u2248 8.3 kpc from the galactic center. In the Schwarzschild limit, the angular radius is \u03b8SchwE = 1.186 arc sec. Using equation (53), one finds that small deviations from \u03b8SchwE at a = 0.90 requires cO \u223c 4\u00d71031, which means that Nature contains much more bosonic degrees of freedom than the fermionic ones.\n14"

The most direct way to determine the eccentricity e is to apply successive approximations about the quasi-Newtonian orbit in (56).

            "text": "Here, we will explore the effects of the loop factor cO on photonsphere and shadow radius of a black hole for a stationary observer. We will do this exploration by following the formalism developed by Perlick and others [145]. To this end, we begin with the Lagrangian,\nL(x, x\u0307) = 1\n2\n( \u2212A(r)t\u03072 +B(r)r\u03072 + C(r)\u03d5\u03072 ) (67)\nfrom which we derive the geodesics along the equatorial plane. This Lagrangian gives rise to two constants of motion (energy E and angular momentum L)\nE = A(r)t\u0307, L = C(r)\u03d5\u0307, (68)\nand an additional relation\n\u2212A(r)t\u03072 +B(r)r\u03072 + C(r)\u03d5\u03072 = 0 (69)\nfor null geodesics (massless particles). This latter relation leads to the orbit equation for null light rays(\ndr\nd\u03d5\n)2 = r4 ( E2\nL2 \u2212 a\u2212 1 24\u03c0cO \u2212 1 r2 + 2M r3\n) . (70)\nafter using the conserved quantities E and L. Under the conditions dr/d\u03d5 = 0 and d2r/d\u03d52 = 0, the radius of the photonsphere\nrph = 3M (71)\n16\nturns out to be independent of the parameters a and cO. This, of course, does not mean that the shadow itself is independent of the symmergent gravity parameters. Indeed, as we shall see later, escaping light rays are succumbed to the astrophysical environment in a way sensitive to a and cO.\nIn the presence of small perturbations in their circular motions at rph = 3M , the light rays can either spiral to the black hole or escape to infinity. The impact parameter for light rays is given by b = L/E, and its critical value bcrit can be determined via the condition dr/d\u03d5 = 0 in the orbit equation. Thus, using (71), it is found to be\nb2crit = 27M2\n3(a\u22121) 8\u03c0cO\nM2 + 1 . (72)\nLet us consider a static observer with coordinates (to, ro, \u03b8o = \u03c0/2, \u03c6 = 0). Light which escaped from the photonsphere then approaches and leaves the observer at some angle \u03b8. To this end, the shadow angle is given by\ntan \u03b8sh = b2crit\nC(ro)/A(ro)\nd\u03d5\ndr \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 r=ro . (73)\nBy a simple trigonometric identity and with the use of the orbit equation (70), the exact expression for the radius of the shadow can then be derived as\nRsh = rph\n2 ( 1\u2212 2Mro + a\u22121 24\u03c0cO r2o ) 1\u2212 Mrph + a\u22121 36\u03c0cO r2ph 1/2 (74)\nwhere we have written Rsh = ro sin \u03b8sh. Here, if ro = 3M , we get Rsh = 3M , which implies that \u03b8sh = \u03c0/2 and half of the sky is dark. Such a result is in accordance with the results of [145]. We need to take note again that the overall contribution of the symmergent parameters mimics the effects of the cosmological constant. Indeed, looking at (74) with a < 1, we see that cO < 0 (nB < nF) mimics the AdS case while cO < 0 (nB < nF) does the dS case.\nDepicted in Figure 17 is the variation of the shadow radius in equation (74) with the position ro of the observer for a = 0.9 and cO = \u00b10.8 and \u00b11. The plot also contains the Schwarzschild case (black curve), for comparison. As expected, the Schwarzschild case approaches asymptotically to 3 \u221a 3M at large ro/M . One again notes that the symmergent gravity contribution mimics the effects of the cosmological constant, and significant effects are possible only at very large distances that are comparable to the cosmological horizon. Even at the location of Earth, its effects remain negligible. However, we can scale the parameters such that symmergent gravity effects get pronounced. In Figure 17, we can clearly see that the effect is unobservable weak at small distances (like, for example, ro = 3M ). At large distances, however, shadow radii in symmergent gravity deviate significantly from the Schwarzschild curve, such that the dS (cO > 0 \u21d2 nB > nF) and AdS (cO < 0 \u21d2 nB < nF) are clearly distinguished. The dS type collapses the shadow radius at very large distances, and it implies that black holes near the cosmological horizon may have very small shadow radii. The AdS case, however, is blind to such critical radii as its shadow radius increases indefinitely.\nThe shadow radius of the black hole Sgr A* can be approximated as 3 \u221a 3M . It is so because ro >> M , and\n17\na\u22121 24\u03c0cO << M considering our position ro relative to Sgr A*. Keeping in mind that we are still way too far from the cosmological horizon, these conditions allow us to carry out a Taylor expansion in (74) to find\nRsh \u2248 3 \u221a 3M+\n\u221a 3\n16 a\u2212 1 \u03c0cO\nMr2o+O(M2r\u22121o ,M2ro,M3,M3r\u22122o ), (75)\nwhich makes sense only in the inset plot in Figure 17 because the dS structure is still allowed (not applicable to regions exceeding the scaled cosmological horizon). Thus, with this scaling, Earth\u2019s position falls somewhere within the inset plot, where the effects of the symmergent gravity can be disentangled. All these details are explicitly demonstrated in Figure 18. We can estimate further, for a given a, value of cO that gives an appreciable deviation to the shadow radius, and it turns out to be\ncshO = (1\u2212 a)r2o\n48\u03c0 , (76)\nwhich relates cO to the observer\u2019s position ro."

This transformation puts the metric into a new form,\ng\u0303\u00b5\u03bddx\u0303 \u00b5dx\u0303\u03bd = \u2212 ( 1\u2212 M\n2r\u0303 e\u2212Ho t\u0303\n)2( 1 + M\n2r\u0303 e\u2212Ho t\u0303\n)\u22122 c2dt\u03032\n+ e2Ho t\u0303 ( 1 + M\n2r\u0303 e\u2212Ho t\u0303\n)4 ( dr\u03032 + r\u03032d\u21262 ) .\n(79)\nUsing the standard aberration formula, the shadow angular radius formula in Ref. [145] can be rectified and, as a result, the shadow radius takes the form\nR2shco =\n( 1\u2212 v2 )( 1\u00b1 v \u221a 1\u2212R2sh/r2o\n)2R2sh , (80) for a co-moving observer. The velocity v of the observer\ng\u0303\u00b5\u03bdu \u00b5 shcou \u03bd shco = \u2212(1\u2212 v2)\u22121/2 (81)\nis set by the twiddled metric. In fact, using the normalization condition\ng\u00b5\u03bdu \u00b5 shu \u03bd sh = \u22121 (82)\none gets the velocity,\nv = \u221a (1\u2212 a) 2\u03c0cO ro ( 1\u2212 2M ro )\u22121/2 . (83)\nIt is clear from the velocity formula that if a < 1, cO is not allowed to be negative (at least for the parameters in this study). At any rate, this condition corresponds to a dS (cO > 0 \u21d2 nB > nF) type symmergent black hole, which is consistent with the fact that we are embedded in a dS-type Universe. After substituting these formulae, we finally get the exact expression for shadow radius as observed by a co-moving observer\nRshco = 3 \u221a 3M \u221a( 1\u2212 2M\nro\n)[ 1\u2212 9(1\u2212 a)M 2\n8\u03c0cO\n]\n\u2213 3 \u221a\n3roM \u221a 1\u2212 a 24\u03c0c \u221a 1\u2212 27M 2\nr2o\n( 1\u2212 2M\nro\n) . (84)\n18\nIn this formula, upper (lower) sign is used for the domain rh1 < ro < rh2 (rh1 < ro < \u221e). These two domains are illustrated in Figure 19. Comparing Figure\n19 to Figure 17, one observes that a co-moving observer can have the ability to measure a considerable deviation from the shadow radius under the effect of dS symmergent spacetime in regions near ro = 3M . The reason for this is that the deviation due to a static observer is vanishingly small. Needless to say, this region corresponds to locations in the Universe far from the cosmological horizon. It is highly interesting that theoretical considerations do not admit the AdS (cO < 0 \u21d2 nB < nF) symmergent case, and this is in perfect agreement with the already observed dS - Universe [146]. One nevertheless keeps in mind that if the black hole being observed is embedded in space with extreme expansion, a co-moving observer (knowing that he/she lives in the dS type Universe) will perceive a larger shadow radius (very large deviation).\nIn similarity to the shadow radius for a static observer, the conditions ro >> m and a\u2212124\u03c0cO << m applies if Earth is co-moving with the cosmological expansion. In this case, one can perform a Taylor expansion of equation (84) to get,\nRshco \u2248 3 \u221a 3M [ 1 +\n(1\u2212 a) 24\u03c0cO ro\n] , (85)\nwhich is in agreement with equation (40) of the reference [145]. Then, similar to (76), we can have an estimate of cO such that it gives cause to a significant deviation from the shadow radius of the black hole under observation, and we end up with\ncshcoO = (1\u2212 a)ro\n24\u03c0 . (86)\nTo contrast observations of stationary and co-moving observers, we plot the equations (76) and (86) in Figure 20. It follows from the figure that the requisite nB \u2212 nF (boson-fermion number difference) for an observer to perceive a considerable deviation on the shadow radius depends on the state of the observer. Indeed, a comoving observer needs less nB \u2212 nF to perceive a considerable deviation than a stationary observer."

            "heading": "X. CONCLUSIONS",
            "text": "In the present work, we have performed a comprehensive and systematic study of the symmergent gravity in black hole environments.\nWe started with the black hole solution in the symmergent gravity, with a detailed analysis of the properties of their event horizons. We have shown that the outer and cosmologic-like horizons exist in the cases cO < 0 & a > 1 and cO > 0 & a < 1, and an increase in a at cO < 0 causes these horizons to move away from each other, namely the outer (cosmological) horizon moves to larger (smaller) radii. These horizon properties enabled the determination of the allowed ranges of the symmergent gravity parameters a and cO.\nHaving revealed the horizon properties, we turned to an investigation of the dynamics of test particles around the symmergent black hole. We have found that there are four solutions for ISCO radius together with the OSCO. In fact, ISCOs and OSCOs exist in the cases cO < 0 & a > 1 and cO > 0 & a < 1.\nWe have also studied the effects of symmergent gravity parameters on the frequencies of Keplerian orbits, as well as the radial oscillations of test particles along their circular stable orbits. In our analyses, we employed the known QPO models of RP, WD, ER2, and ER3 mod-\n19\nels. We have shown that low-frequency QPOs switch off in the symmergent gravity and the abundance of the high-frequency twin-peak QPOs increase (decreases) at a > 1 (a < 1). We have utilized the QPOs of the microquasars GRS 1915-105, GRO J1655-40, XTE J1550-564, and H1743+322 as well as the supermassive black hole Sgr A* to constrain the symmergent gravity parameters, and found a nearly model-independent relationship between a and cO.\nWe have further studied the effects of symmergent gravity parameters on the weak deflection angle as well as the shadow of the black hole. We have obtained the general expression of weak deflection angle using appropriate models in a way involving finite distances of the source and the receiver. We have determined variations of the weak deflection angle with the symmergent gravity parameters a and cO. Our results, despite the scaling of symmergent gravity effects via the selected values of a and cO, suggest that it is possible to disentangle symmergent effects via observable deviations, especially in the Einstein ring formation. We also studied how the dS and AdS type symmergent geometries are sensitive to the said deviations. Considering the center of our galaxy, a small deviation from the Schwarzschild case requires cO \u223c 4 \u00d7 1031, which means that Nature contains much more bosonic degrees of freedom than the fermionic ones. (One keeps in mind that, by the nature of the symmergent gravity, the extra particles do not need to couple to the known particles). Concerning the measurements of the deflection angle, we believe\nthat it could be possible to resolve symmergent gravity effects with the advent of the space technologies, such as the improved ESA GAIA mission and the Event horizon telescope, and the more powerful VLBI RadioAstron.\nFor the symmergent black hole shadow, we derived an exact analytical formula for the shadow radius, both for static and co-moving observers. Our analysis suggests that an observer, co-moving with the Universe\u2019s expansion, can measure a larger deviation from the shadow radius than a static observer. A co-moving observer can also measure a larger shadow radius for black holes embedded in the extreme expansion of spacetime. We contrasted determinations of the parameter cO for static and co-moving observers and found that the latter observes less difference between nB and nF under the effect of cosmic expansion.\nOur analysis in this work can be extended to other physical phenomena. One immediate extension would be the generalization of the metric to spinning symmergent black holes. Another extension would be examining the effects of matter and radiation-dominated Universes on shadow radius as perceived by a co-moving observer. Yet another extension would be the analysis of a varying Hubble\u2019s constant near the cosmic horizon. Concerning the astrophysical objects, our analysis here can be extended to neutron stars, magnetars, and as such to determine the allowed ranges of the symmergent gravity parameters. It would be fair to say that there is a wealth of phenomena that could be analyzed in the framework of symmergent gravity.\n[1] B. P. Abbott et al. (LIGO Scientific, Virgo), Phys. Rev.
