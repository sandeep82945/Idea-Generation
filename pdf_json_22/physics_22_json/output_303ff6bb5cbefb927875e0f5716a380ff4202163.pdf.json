    "abstractText": "The power spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies is a leading evidence for the existence of the dark components of the universe. This owes to the severely constraining precision of the observational data [1, 2] and to the concordance within the dark energy-cold dark matter model (\u039b-CDM, the standard model of cosmology) of the energy and matter densities obtained from the CMB with those derived from other observations, e.g., supernovae at large redshift z [3]. Despite the success of \u039b-CDM, the absence of direct [4] or indirect [5] detection of dark matter particles is worrisome since searches have nearly exhausted the parameter space where likely candidates could reside. In addition, the straightforward extensions of particle physics\u2019 Standard Model, e.g., minimal SUSY, that provided promising dark matter candidates are essentially ruled out [6]. \u039b-CDM also displays tensions with cosmological observations, e.g., it overestimates the number of dwarf galaxies and globular clusters [7] or has no easy explanation for the tight correlations found between galactic dynamical quantities and the supposedly sub-dominant baryonic matter, e.g., the Tully-Fisher [8] or McGaugh et al. relations [9]. These worries are remotivating the exploration of alternatives to dark matter and possibly dark energy. To be as compelling as \u039b-CDM, such alternatives must explain the observations suggestive of dark matter/energy consistently and economically (viz, without introducing many parameters and fields). Among such observations, the CMB power spectrum is arguably the most prominent. Here we study whether the self-interaction (SI) of gravitational fields, a defining property of General Relativity (GR), may allow us to describe the CMB power spectrum without introducing dark components, or modifying the known laws of nature. GR\u2019s SI already explains other key observations involving dark matter/energy: flat galactic rotation curves [10], large-z supernova luminosities [11], large structure formation [12], and internal dynamics of galaxy clusters, including the Bullet Cluster [10]. It also explains the Tully-Fisher and McGaugh et al. relations [13]. First, we recall the origin of GR\u2019s SI and discuss when it becomes important as well as its overall effects.",

USA 2Old Dominion University, Norfolk, VA 23529. USA\nField self-interactions are at the origin of the non-linearities inherent to General Relativity. We study their effects on the Cosmic Microwave Background anisotropies. We find that they can reduce or alleviate the need for dark matter and dark energy in the description of the Cosmic Microwave Background power spectrum.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nThe power spectrum of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies is a leading evidence for the existence of the dark components of the universe. This owes to the severely constraining precision of the observational data [1, 2] and to the concordance within the dark energy-cold dark matter model (\u039b-CDM, the standard model of cosmology) of the energy and matter densities obtained from the CMB with those derived from other observations, e.g., supernovae at large redshift z [3]. Despite the success of \u039b-CDM, the absence of direct [4] or indirect [5] detection of dark matter particles is worrisome since searches have nearly exhausted the parameter space where likely candidates could reside. In addition, the straightforward extensions of particle physics\u2019 Standard Model, e.g., minimal SUSY, that provided promising dark matter candidates are essentially ruled out [6]. \u039b-CDM also displays tensions with cosmological observations, e.g., it overestimates the number of dwarf galaxies and globular clusters [7] or has no easy explanation for the tight correlations found between galactic dynamical quantities and the supposedly sub-dominant baryonic matter, e.g., the Tully-Fisher [8] or McGaugh et al. relations [9]. These worries are remotivating the exploration of alternatives to dark matter and possibly dark energy. To be as compelling as \u039b-CDM, such alternatives must explain the observations suggestive of dark matter/energy consistently and economically (viz, without introducing many parameters and fields). Among such observations, the CMB power spectrum is arguably the most prominent.\nHere we study whether the self-interaction (SI) of gravitational fields, a defining property of General Relativity (GR), may allow us to describe the CMB power spectrum without introducing dark components, or modifying the known laws of nature. GR\u2019s SI already explains other key observations involving dark matter/energy: flat galactic rotation curves [10], large-z supernova luminosities [11], large structure formation [12], and internal dynamics of galaxy clusters, including the Bullet Cluster [10]. It also explains the Tully-Fisher and McGaugh et al. relations [13]. First, we recall the origin of GR\u2019s SI and discuss when it becomes important as well as its overall effects.\nII. FIELD SELF-INTERACTION\nA crucial difference between Newtonian gravity and GR is that the former is a linear theory for which field superposition principle applies, while the latter is not, i.e., fields self-interact and the combination of two fields differ from their sum. The origin of this phenomenon can be identified after analyzing the Lagrangian of GR,\nLGR = \u221a det(g\u00b5\u03bd) g\u00b5\u03bdR \u00b5\u03bd/(16\u03c0G), (1)\nwhere G is the gravitational coupling, g\u00b5\u03bd the metric, and R\u00b5\u03bd the Ricci tensor. One defines the gravitational field \u03c6\u00b5\u03bd by the difference between g\u00b5\u03bd and a constant reference metric \u03b7\u00b5\u03bd , e.g., that of Minkowski or Schwarzschild: \u03c6\u00b5\u03bd \u2261 (g\u00b5\u03bd\u2212\u03b7\u00b5\u03bd)/ \u221a M . The normalization by the system mass M makes \u03c6\u00b5\u03bd the field due to a unit mass. Developing LGR yields:\nLGR = \u221e\u2211 n=0 (16\u03c0MG)n/2 [\u03c6n\u2202\u03c6\u2202\u03c6] . (2)\n(We consider the pure field case, which is sufficient and simpler. The general case including matter can be found, e.g., in Refs. [14].) The [\u03c6n\u2202\u03c6\u2202\u03c6] denotes a sum of Lorentz-invariant terms of the form \u03c6n\u2202\u03c6\u2202\u03c6. Newtonian gravity is obtained by choosing the Minkowski metric for \u03b7\u00b5\u03bd and truncating Eq. (2) to n = 0, with [\u2202\u03c6\u2202\u03c6] = \u2202 \u00b5\u03c600\u2202\u00b5\u03c6 00 and \u22020\u03c600 = 0. The n > 0 terms, then, cause the field SI. The same SI phenomenon exists with the nuclear Strong Force, which is formalized by quantum chromodynamics (QCD). In fact, QCD and GR have the same lagrangian structure that, inter alia, enables fundamental field SI. Field SI is the hallmark of QCD since its large coupling makes the\nar X\niv :2\n20 3.\n02 35\n0v 2\n[ gr\n-q c]\n2 3\nM ay\n2 02\n2\nSI effects prominent. In contrast in GR, field coupling is driven by \u223c\n\u221a\nGM/L (with L a length characterizing the system), whose typically small value allows us to approximate gravity with a linear theory, e.g., the Newtonian or the\nFierz-Pauli approximations of GR. However, once \u221a GM/L becomes large enough, SI must arise. In fact, it was shown\nin Refs. [10] that for galaxies, \u221a GM/L can be sufficiently large to enable SI. These then strengthen the binding of the galaxy components in a manner that straightforwardly produces flat galactic rotation curves [10]. The strengthening also alleviates the need for dark matter to explain the growth of large structures [12]. Employing Newtonian gravity to analyze these subjects overlooks the SI and, if the latter is important, induces apparent mass discrepancies interpreted as dark matter. Another crucial effect of SI arises from energy conservation: the strengthening of the system binding must be compensated by a suppression of the gravitational field outside of the system. For example in QCD, the increased binding confines quarks into nucleons and meanwhile the force is suppressed outside the nucleon resulting in a much weaker large-distance residual force, the Yukawa interaction. If the equivalent effect [15] for massive systems bound by GR is overlooked, the large-distance suppression of gravity can be mistaken for a global repulsion (dark energy) that balances the supposedly pristine force [11]. The direct connection between observations linked to dark energy and dark matter, unexpected within \u039b-CDM, naturally explains the cosmic coincidence problem [16].\nThe local effects of GR\u2019s SI, i.e., the increase of the binding energy of systems, can be directly calculated from Eq. (1) [10, 13]. Global effects, i.e., the large-distance suppression of gravity, have been treated effectively in Ref. [11] by folding them into a depletion function DM (z). In fact, lifting the standard Friedmann-Lema\u0302\u0131tre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) approximations of isotropy and homogeneity makes DM (z) to appear in the universe evolution equation [11]. There, DM = 0 represents a full suppression of gravity at large-distance and DM = 1, none. In particular, DM (z) \u2248 1 at z 1 since the early universe was nearly homogeneous and isotropic, while for the present web-like structured universe, DM (z \u2248 0) < 1. If all the fields were fully trapped into the structures that generate them, there would be no large-scale manifestation of gravity and DM (z \u2248 0) \u2192 0. However, since the symmetry of a system suppresses SI effects [10, 17], DM (z) increases at small z, e.g., because the ratio of elliptical over disk galaxies increases as z \u2192 0 [18]. These features are conveniently parameterized by [11]:\nDM (z) = 1\u2212 (1 + e(z\u2212zg)/\u03c4 )\u22121 +Ae\u2212z/b (3)\nwhere zg is the redshift halfway through the galaxy formation epoch, \u03c4 the length of this epoch, A the ratio of structures whose shapes evolved into more symmetric ones, and b the duration of this process. Fig. 1 shows the DM (z) from [11].\nAccounting for the consequences of GR\u2019s SI in the evolution of an inhomogeneous universe and of its large structures has been investigated using other methods than Eq. (3). Particularly, backreaction effects, which also originate from field SI, have been proposed to explain without dark energy the universe apparent acceleration, see review [19]. Most such studies are performed perturbatively and therefore omit the nonperturbative effects that are crucial in analogous QCD phenomena, e.g., quark confinement or the feebleness of hadron-hadron interaction comparatively to QCD\u2019s strength. From this perspective, it is unsurprising that these studies do not find important effects from backreaction. While perturbative treatments of backreaction are already nontrivial, nonperturbative ones are more difficult but indicate that backreaction is important [20]. Although backreaction studies and our approach both investigate the consequence for dark energy of the n > 0 terms of Eq. (2), the former approach assumes dark matter whereas the latter deduces, by solving nonperturbatively Eq. (2), that dark matter is also a consequence of GR\u2019s SI [10]. The latter approach then identifies an explicit nonperturbative process (field trapping) that exposes a direct connection between dark matter and dark energy [11]. Aside investigations of backreation, other ideas have been proposed to\n3 explain the universe acceleration without dark energy, e.g., f(R)-gravity [21]. The key difference between these ideas and our approach is that they are beyond both GR, the current theory of gravity, and the Standard Model of Particle Physics (SMPP) since they postulate new fields to be yet detected. For example, while Eq. (2) is only a reexpression of GR\u2019s Lagrangian, Eq. (1), [14], f(R) theories add to Eq. (1) terms in powers of R \u2261 g\u00b5\u03bdR\u00b5\u03bd that go beyond GR, and requires \u201cscalaron\u201d fields and dark matter, both beyond the SMPP. This contrasts with our approach that is within both GR and the SMPP and connects dark energy and dark matter. Other extensions of GR than f(R) theories may link dark energy to dark matter, e.g., [22] but so far they have not reproduced the CMB.\nIn the next section, we recall the expression of the CMB anisotropy correlation coefficient derived in the hydrodynamic approximation [23]. Then we discuss how SI modifies it and compare its computed values to the observations. In what follows, t denotes time, T the universe temperature, a the Robertson-Walker scale factor, and H the Hubble parameter, with h its value in units of 100 km/s/Mpc. The subscripts 0, EQ and L indicate values for the present, matter-radiation equilibrium, and last scattering times, respectively. CsTT,l is the scalar multipole coefficient for the temperature-temperature angular correlation of the CMB anisotropies, with l the multipole moment. The baryon, total matter, radiation, photon, cold dark matter, and dark energy densities relative to the critical density are \u2126B , \u2126M , \u2126R, \u2126\u03b3 , \u2126DM , and \u2126\u039b, respectively, and \u2126K \u2261 K/a20H20 with K the metric curvature constant. Since dark matter and dark energy are not assumed, \u2126DM = 0 and \u2126\u039b = 0 here."

[23]. The first term in the curly bracket includes the Doppler effect, while the second term includes the Sachs-Wolf and intrinsic temperature anisotropy effects. Both terms include large-l damping. Equation (4) is suited for the range 30 . l . 2000 since it does not include the integrated Sachs-Wolf, Sunyaev-Zel\u2019dovich, and cosmic variance effects.\nAlthough Eq. (4) without C(l) provides a good overall description of the CMB anisotropies [23], it is not fully accurate, hence the second-order correction C(l). It is numerically obtained by the difference between the first-order term in Eq. (4) and a formally exact numerical calculation of l(l + 1)C s TT,l/2\u03c0, e.g. [24], with both calculations performed with the \u039b-CDM best fit parameters. It is sufficient for our purpose to restrict the SI corrections to the first-order term, since C(l) is by definition comparatively less dependent on cosmological parameters.\nAt the time of last scattering, GR\u2019s SI effects are negligible. Thus, the mechanisms shaping Eq. (4) are unaffected and its form can be used as is. Since S, T , and \u2206 are time-independent and characterize the primordial scalar perturbations, the parameterizations [23] of these transfer functions also remain unmodified. On the other hand, the cosmological parameters and characteristic scales (distance or multipole) entering Eq. (4) are derived from present-day z = 0 values and evolved back to z = zL. It is through this evolution, which depends on the universe dynamics, that SI influences CsTT,l. The quantities affected are the angular diameter distance of last scattering dA (Eq. (5)), the damping length dD, the scale dT , the acoustic horizon distance (Eq. (6)), the \u2126i, and the ratio RL. Since lR, lT , lD and lH involve dA, dT , dD or dH , they are also affected by SI.\nThe distances dA and dH are given by:\ndA = 1\u221a\n\u2126KH0(1 + zL) sinh\n[\u221a \u2126K \u222b 1 1/(1+zL) dx\u221a \u2126\u039bx4 + \u2126Kx2 + \u2126Mx ] , (5)\ndH = 2\nH0(3RL\u2126M ) 1/2(1 + zL)\n3/2 ln ( [ \u221a 1 +RL + \u221a REQ +RL]/[1 + \u221a REQ] ) . (6)\nTwo terms contribute to the damping length, dD \u2261 \u221a d2Landau + d2Silk:\nd2Landau = 3\u03c32t2L\n8T 2L(1 +RL) ,\n4\nwhere \u03c3 is the standard deviation for the temperature TL owing to the fact that recombination was not instantaneous, and:\nd2Silk = R2L\n6(1\u2212 Y )(nB0)\u03c3TH0 \u221a \u2126MR 9/2 0 \u222b RL 0\nR2dR X(R)(1 +R) \u221a REQ +R\n[ 16\n15 +\nR2\n1 +R\n] ,\nwhere Y ' 0.24 is the density fraction for nucleons in neutral Helium, nB0 the present baryon number density, \u03c3T the Thompson cross-section, X the fractional ionization of the plasma, and R(t) \u2261 3\u03c1B(t)/4\u03c1\u03b3(t), with \u03c1i denoting average absolute densities. An approximation for X is [25]:\nX(T ) ' [ X(3400)\u22121 + \u2126B\n\u2126 1/2 M\n\u222b 3400 T\n84.2T \u2032\u22120.1166 1 + 0.005085T \u20320.53 + 42200T \u20320.8834e\u221239474/T \u2032 dT \u2032 ]\u22121 . (7)\nThe SI affects dSilk through \u2126M , REQ, and X since the latter depends on \u2126M and \u2126B . The density ratio R(t) is not affected by the SI because the SI leaves the evolutions of \u03c1i unaffected [11]. However, REQ is affected since it is not defined as an absolute density ratio but as REQ \u2261 \u2126RR0/\u2126M . REQ is identical to R(tEQ) for a FLRW universe, but not anymore once SI is accounted for. In this case it must be redefined as:\nREQ \u2261 3\u2126R\u2126B\n4DM (0)\u2126\u03b3(1 + zL) .\nThe distance dLandau is affected by SI only [26] through the time of last rescattering,\ntL = 1\nH0 \u222b 1/(1+zL) 0 x [ \u2126\u039bx 4 + \u2126Kx 2 + \u2126Mx+ \u2126R ]\u22121/2 dx.\nWe now examine how SI specifically modifies the quantities just listed. SI is accounted for by replacing the \u2126i by the screened relative densities \u2126\u2217M (z) \u2261 \u2126MDM (z), \u2126\u2217B(z) \u2261 \u2126BDM (z) and \u2126\u2217K \u2261 1\u2212\u2126R \u2212\u2126\u2217M (z = 0) [11]. \u2126R and \u2126\u03b3 remain unscreened because radiation does not aggregate. The \u2126 \u2217 i are effective dynamical quantities that enter in the evolution equation of the universe. Therefore, they should not be compared with densities obtained from censuses or primordial synthesis.\nSI affects the parameters of Eq. (4) in two ways: (1) it enhances local gravitational attraction; (2) it globally suppresses gravity at large distances. Effect (1) is important when the local universe density variation is large, i.e., for t tL. Since the mechanisms producing Eq. (4) occurred when density variation was small (the integrated Wolf-Sachs and Sunyaev-Zel\u2019dovich effects are not included in Eq. (4)), effect (1) can be ignored. In other words, in the expressions formalizing the mechanisms generating the temperature anisotropies, \u2126B can remain since \u2126 \u2217 B(z 1) ' \u2126B . Effect (2) influences the universe evolution and therefore affects how characteristic scales evolved since tL. Thus, when \u2126M enters the expressions related to the evolution of the universe, it is replaced by \u2126\u2217M . Since \u2126M is defined relative to the critical density for a FLRW universe, for a flat universe with \u2126\u039b = 0 and \u2126R 1, \u2126M = 1 and \u2126\u2217M = DM (z). (Note that for effect (2), \u2126B is irrelevant since it is not explicitly present in the universe evolution equation, being included in \u2126M ). Table I summarizes the expressions modified to account for SI.\nWe can now compute CsTT,l with the SI effects included. The values of T0, \u2126\u03b3 and \u2126R are well known from the measurement of the CMB average temperature. We use T0 = 2.7255K [27], \u2126\u03b3h 2 = 2.47 \u00d7 10\u22125 and \u2126R = 1.6813\u2126\u03b3 [23]. The remaining quantities (H0, ns, zL (or TL), \u03c3tL , \u2126B and Ne \u2212\u03c4reion) are the free parameters to be determined by fitting the CMB data. The number of parameters is lower than for \u039b-CDM since \u2126DM \u2261 0, \u2126\u039b \u2261 0 and no assumption is needed for the thermodynamical properties of dark energy. In principle, DM (z), see Eq. (3), is fixed but in practice it can vary within its uncertainty, see Fig. 1. We used zg = 8.5, \u03c4 = 4.5, A = 0.25 and b = 0.3. Equation (4) with the expressions in the third column of Table I and DM (z) from Eq. (3) fits the scalar CMB anstropies for \u2126B = 0.026, H0 = 70km/s/Mpc, Ne\n\u2212\u03c4reion = 1.24 \u00d7 10\u22125, ns = 0.97, zL = 1380 and \u03c3/TL = 0.17, see Fig. 2. No uncertainties are assigned since our goal is not to provide a precise determination of cosmological parameters, but rather to determine if SI can be a natural and viable alternative to \u039b-CDM."

            "text": "To be plausible, an alternative to \u039b-CDM must account consistently for the observations related to dark matter and dark energy. Having examined the CMB anisotropies, the main object of this article, we now briefly discuss the consistency of the present approach with other important cosmological observations: the apparent magnitude of standard candles at large-z, large structure formation, the matter power spectrum P (k), and the age of the universe. Except for P (k), these observations were studied in detail in Refs. [11, 12] using the DM (z) originally determined in [11] (red hatched band in Fig. 1). Yet, although the band contains the DM (z) determined by our fit to the CMB observations (blue line in Fig. 1), the latter is more constrained and therefore need not provide results consistent with the other cosmological observations just mentionned. Nevertheless, the large-z data [3, 28, 29] remain well described with the DM (z) determined by our CMB fit, see Fig. 3, left panel.\nThe effect of SI on structure formation was treated in Ref. [12]. The central panel of Fig. 3 shows the time-evolution of an overdensity of initial value \u03b4(tL) = 2\u00d7 10\u22125 calculated with the DM (z) from our fit in Fig. 2 and without dark matter. This yields \u03b4(t0) \u2248 1, consistent with the fact that structures had time to grow to their present densities.\nThe observation of the present distribution of structures, expressed by P (k) where k is the wavenumber, is another important constraint for cosmological models. As shown in the right panel of Fig. 3, the general shape of P (k) can be described without dark matter/energy once SI effects are included. The reason is that the effects of Inflation on the early universe are unaffected by SI since the near uniformity and isotropy of the universe at early (postinflation) times suppress SI effects (see Section II). Thus, at low k, P (k) \u221d kns with ns = 0.97 from our CMB fit in Fig. 2. This is valid up to k . kmax with, in the SI framework, kmax = \u221a 2kEQ = 2H0 \u221a \u2126\u2217M/aEQ [11] (where the effect of ns 6= 1 can be neglected: kmax increases by 1% for ns = 0.97), with \u2126\u2217M = DM (0). Our CMB fit of Fig. 2 yields kmax = 0.014hMpc\n\u22121, in agreement with observations [30]. The spectrum maximum is given by P (kmax) = 1.10 \u00d7 1014[C(1/\u2126\u2217M \u2212 1)N/h]2/\u2126\u2217M with C(x) = 56x \u22125/6\u221a1 + x \u222b x 0 du u1/6(1+u)3/2 [23]. With our CMB fit values, P (kmax) = 2.4\u00d7 104 (h\u22121Mpc)3 [31]. The dissipative processes arising for k > kmax involve in our case only non-relativistic baryonic matter, thus preserving the P (k) \u221d k\u22123 expected for k > kmax from a nearly scale-invariant primordial power spectrum. While the detailed analysis of the finer structure of P (k) is beyond the scope of this article, no difficulty is expected since that structure arises from baryon acoustic oscillations and Silk damping, both\nalready well reproduced in Fig. 2. Finally, the parameter values of our CMB fit in Fig. 2 yield an age of the universe after accounting for SI [11] of 12.8Gyr. This agrees with the oldest known objects whose ages are estimated independently of cosmological models, namely the chemical elements (14.5+2.8\u22122.5Gyr [35]), oldest stars (13.5\u00b11Gyr [36]), oldest star clusters (12.8 +0.9 \u22120.8Gyr [37]), and oldest white dwarfs (12.8\u00b1 1.1Gyr [38])."

            "text": "Our result shows that the CMB scalar anisotropies may be accurately explained without dark matter and dark energy once the field self-interaction of General Relativity is accounted for. The effect of the latter is folded in a universal function DM (z) that is obtained from the timescale of large structure formation and the relative amounts of baryonic matter present in these structures [11]. DM (z) is universal since it explains high-z supernovae measurements [11] (Fig. 3, left panel), large structure formation [12] (Fig. 3, central panel), the shape of the matter power spectrum (Fig. 3, right panel), and the CMB anisotropies (Fig. 2). The SI of GR also eliminates the need for dark matter to explain the internal dynamics of structures: it straightforwardly yields flat rotation curves for disk galaxies [10], explains the empirical tight relation between baryonic and observed accelerations [9, 13], the Tully-Fisher relation [8, 10, 11], and accounts for the dynamics of galaxy clusters [10]. This framework is economical \u2013no exotic matter, fields, nor modification of gravity are needed\u2013 and natural. Interestingly, QCD, whose Lagrangian\u2019s structure is similar to that of GR, exhibits phenomena similar to those regarded as evidences for dark matter and dark energy.\nAcknowledgments This work is funded in part by a Dominion Scholar grant from Old Dominion University.

Zee, \u201cEinstein gravity in a Nutshell\u201d, 2013, Princeton University Press [15] The universe evolution equation is based on GR and thus in principle includes the effect of SI. However, the usual FLRW model assumes complete isotropy and homogeneity. These approximations suppress the SI [10, 13, 17].
