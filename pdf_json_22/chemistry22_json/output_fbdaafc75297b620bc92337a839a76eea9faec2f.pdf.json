    "abstractText": "Hydrazones and their metal derivatives are very important compounds in medicinal chemistry due to their reported variety of biological activities, such as antibacterial, antifungal and anticancer action. Five hydrazone-pyrazolone ligands H2L n (n = 1\u20135) were prepared and fully characterized and their tautomerism was investigated in the solid state and solution. Five zinc(II) complexes 1\u20135 of composition [Zn(HL)2] (n = 1 and 2), [Zn(HL)2(H2O)2] (n = 3 and 5) and [Zn(HL )2]n were synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, IR, H, F, C, and N NMR spectroscopy, and ESI mass spectrometry. In addition, the structures of two ligands and three complexes were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The ligands H2L 2 and H2L 4",

Five hydrazone-pyrazolone ligands H2L n (n = 1\u20135) were prepared and fully characterized and their tautomerism was investigated in the solid state and solution. Five zinc(II) complexes 1\u20135 of composition [Zn(HLn)2] (n = 1 and 2), [Zn(HLn)2(H2O)2] (n = 3 and 5) and [Zn(HL 4)2]n were synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, IR, 1H, 19F, 13C, and 15N NMR spectroscopy, and ESI mass spectrometry. In addition, the structures of two ligands and three complexes were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. The ligands H2L 2 and H2L 4 exist both in the NH,NH tautomeric form. Complexes 1 and 2 are mononuclear compounds, while complex\n4 is a one-dimensional coordination compound. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried\nout on proligands, their anions and all zinc complexes, confirming the experimental results, supporting IR\nand NMR assignments and giving proofs of the mononuclear diaqua structure of complexes 3 and 5.\nThe antibacterial activity of the free ligands and the Zn(II) complexes was established against Escherichia coli\nand Staphylococcus aureus, and a strong efficiency has been found for Zn(II) complexes, particularly for\nthe polynuclear 4 and the mononuclear diaqua complex 5, the latter containing a ligand with aliphatic\nand fluorinated substituents able to compromise the permeability of and disrupt the bacterial cell\nmembrane."

H2L 1 and H2L 3 were previously reported by us and fully characterized in combination with (arene)Ru(II) acceptors,44 whereas proligands H2L 2, H2L 4 and H2L\n5 are new. They are sharp melting solid substances, soluble in DMSO, DMF, chlorinated solvents, acetone, acetonitrile, and alcohols and are slightly soluble in diethyl ether. These molecules can in principle exist in two tautomeric forms (I and II in Scheme 1), depending on the electronic features of R1 and R2 substituents and on the solvent of crystallization.45 In detail, H2L\n1 is known to exists in the solid state as uncommon zwitterion while H2L 3 adopts a N\u2013H,O\u2013H tautomeric form in both solid state and chlorinated solution (Fig. 1).44\nThe new proligands H2L 2, H2L 4 and H2L 5 exist in the N\u2013H, N\u2013H form, tautomer I (Fig. 1). In the solid state, this was confirmed by the X-ray structures of H2L 2 and H2L 4 (discussed below) and the IR data of H2L 5. Characteristic bands were identified in IR spectra of proligands, which were assigned\nalso by comparison with computed IR spectra (see DFT studies below).

Although for H2L 2 only one NH resonance was observed at 6.81 ppm, the N\u2013H,N\u2013H tautomeric form observed in the X-ray is assumed to be preserved also in solution (see DFT studies below), even if in the {1H,15N}-HSQC NMR only the N4\u2013H direct coupling was displayed.\nSynthesis of complexes and spectroscopic characterization\nComplexes 1\u20135 were synthesised by interaction of Zn(O2CCH3)2\u00b7 2H2O with the proligands H2L\nn, in methanol at room temperature. They are sharp melting solids soluble in most organic solvents, and in the case of 2, 3 and 5 also quite soluble in methanol, while not soluble at all in water and ethers. All analytical and spectral data are in accordance with the formulation of complexes proposed in Fig. 2: while 1 and 2 are mononuclear anhydrous [Zn(HL1)2] and [Zn(HL\n2)2] species, complexes 3 and 5 were isolated as diaqua [Zn(HLn)2(H2O)2] compounds, with two water molecules in the zinc coordination sphere, and complex 4 is a monodimensional coordination polymer with formula [Zn(HL4)2]n (see below). While complex 3 is quite soluble in methanol and is isolated as a precipitate from methanol only after few hours of reaction, 4 is not soluble at all in methanol, from which it immediately precipitates. Melting point of 4 is higher than that of 3 of about 20 \u00b0C, in accordance with a different solid state structure. Conductivity measurements in acetonitrile indicate that 1\u20135 are stable and do not dissociate in solution at room temperature. The IR spectra of 1\u20135 provide valuable information about the nature\nof the functional group coordinated to the zinc atom. However, the spectra of proligands are quite complex, especially in the 1500\u20131650 cm\u22121 region from the presence of CvO, CvC, and more than one CvN in their structure, and definitive assignments are not straightforward. Here, we tentatively assign some band on the basis of previous literature on similar chemical systems and DFT calculations. The \u03bd(CvO) band at 1641 cm\u22121 for the free proligand H2L\n1 is shifted upon coordination, which suggests involvement of the keto group of a pyrazolone ring in coordination.44 The strong bands falling between 1626 and 1600 cm\u22121 in the spectra of the other free proligands, which are characteristic of the \u03bd(>CvN\u2013) azomethine group, are shifted to lower wavenumbers in the spectra of the complexes, implying the coordination of the ligands through azomethine nitrogen.52\u201354 Additionally, a medium and broad band at ca. 3300\u20133400 cm\u22121 in the spectra of dihydrate complexes 3 and 5 confirms the presence of water in the zinc environment. By contrast, in the IR of 4 a medium and sharp band was found at 3275 cm\u22121, assigned to \u03bd(N\u2013H) (see Fig. S47 in ESI\u2020). Finally, the formation of new band in the low frequency regions 520\u2013580 and 430\u2013470 cm\u22121 is attributed to \u03bd(M\u2013N) and \u03bd(M\u2013O), respectively.\nThe electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectra of 1\u20135 in positive ion mode, recorded in acetonitrile, show the typical isotopic patterns expected for Zn and display main peaks that correspond to the species [Zn(HL\u2032)]+ arising from dissociation of one ligand and/or [Zn(HL\u2032)(H2L\u2032)]\n+ due to protonation of one ligand in the zinc complex or also to [Zn(HL\u2032)2 + Na]\n+. 1H and 13C chemical shifts in the NMR spectra complexes 1\u20135 display the expected shift of those resonances due to proton and carbon atoms close to N and O donor atoms involved in bonding to zinc. In the case of polynuclear complex 4, we assume that in chloroform the weak intermolecular Zn\u2013O (nitro) interactions are easily broken and mononuclear species are present in solution. The disappearance of resonances at 12.40\u201312.83 ppm but the persistence of those at 6.50\u20136.80 ppm, confirm deprotonation of proligands and presence of the hydrazide N\u2013H upon coordination of the ligands to zinc.\nUnfortunately, no 15N NMR chemical shift was observed for complex 4 and only some indirect 15N NMR chemical shifts of 1\u20133 and 5 were detected (Table 1), but not those of N3 atoms directly coordinated to zinc (and also N5 for complex 1). However, those of vicinal N4 were clearly identified to lower fields for complexes 2, 3 and 5, in accordance with a deshielding upon coordination. Complexes 1\u20135 are stable in DMSO-d6 and do not undergo any dissociation, as established by NMR studies (Fig. S46 in ESI\u2020)."

The comparison between the computed and experimental 1H, 13C and 15N NMR spectral data showed a better fit for tautomer I, proving to be the observed species in solution (for instance, see Fig. S48\u2020 for H2L\n5). In particular, the values for 1H and 13C are very similar for both tautomers (R2 = 0.98\u20130.99, range of correlation values for the NMR comparison), while R2 values from 15N NMR are entirely different, in favour of the NH,NH tautomer I. The calculated structural parameter of tautomer I for proligands H2L 2 and H2L 4 agree well with those observed from the X-ray diffraction results (Fig. S49\u2020). In particular, the experimental CvO bond distances of 1.254(4) and 1.258(2) \u00c5 (for H2L 2 and H2L 4, respectively) is well reproduced by calculations with values of 1.241 and 1.242 \u00c5 for tautomer I vs. 1.321 and 1.326 \u00c5 for tautomer II, confirming the proposed assignment. Finally, the calculated infrared spectra of tautomer I fit well with the experimental ones (for example for H2L\n5, see Fig. S50\u2020), furtherly supporting the IR assignments previously discussed (Table S3\u2020). To analyse the coordination capabilities of proligands, their anionic forms were optimized as well. For all [HLn]\u2212 anions the charge localization reflects the deprotonation of tautomer I, showing a shorter CvO bond than C\u2013N bond (\u223c1.23 \u00c5 vs. \u223c1.30 \u00c5). The MOs mostly involved in the coordination to the metal centre for anions [HL2]\u2212, [HL3]\u2212, [HL4]\u2212 and [HL5]\u2212 are shown to be HOMO\u22122 and HOMO\u22128/\u22129/\u221210 (depending on the species). These being respectively the in-phase and out-ofphase contributions of the \u03c3-type, which are involved in the donation to the zinc centre. Other minor contributions are present with orbitals localized on the N or O atoms. Concerning [HL1]\u2212, additional contributions were obviously found due to its O,N,N-tridentate hapticity (see selected MOs of [HL1]\u2212, [HL2]\u2212 and [HL4]\u2212 in Fig. S51\u2020). The optimized structures of the anions show some differences with respect to the\nFig. 4 Molecular structures of the Zn(II) complexes 1, 2, and 4. Thermal ellipsoids are presented at 50% probability.

View Article Online\nstructure they assume upon coordination. The most noticeable difference is the conformation of the phenyl moiety (on R2 group in Scheme 1): in the optimized anion the phenyl ring is positioned on the same plane of O and N atoms, while in the complex it orientates perpendicularly. Secondly, in the complex, ligand HL2 directs its SO2 group towards the metal centre and in a similar fashion ligand HL4 directs its NO2 group to perform an intermolecular interaction. For these reasons we carried out single-point calculations of the ligands with the geometries found in the optimization of their respective complexes. No significant differences were found and the results, which were also collected in Fig. S51,\u2020 do not require further discussion. Complexes 1\u20133 and 5 were also analysed by DFT using the 6-311G* basis set. Complexes 1, [Zn(HL1)2], and 2, [Zn(HL2)2], are well reproduced by the calculations (Table S4\u2020) and their optimized structures are shown in Fig. S52.\u2020 1 shows an excellent match between the calculated and the experimental data from the X-ray, while in 2 the main discrepancy is the interaction between Zn centre and the O atom of the SO2 group, 2.277 \u00c5, which is shorter than the experimental value of 2.770 \u00c5. In both cases, computed IR and NMR spectra of the optimized 1 and 2 are fully consistent with the experimental data (R2 correlation values of 0.9908 and 9904, respectively, for the NMR comparison). The optimized structures of complexes 3, [Zn(HL3)2(H2O)2], and 5, [Zn(HL5)2(H2O)2] (Fig. 5), display octahedral geometries with two water molecules coordinated in trans position. The coordinated ligands [HL3]\u2212 and [HL5]\u2212 show a bonding localization, which is reminiscent to the tautomer I, with different bond lengths of CvO (ca. 1.27 \u00c5) and CIN (ca. 1.32 \u00c5). To rationalize the octahedral geometry in these compounds, the structures without the coordinated water ligands were additionally optimized. For [Zn(HL3)2], two structures with square planar, 3\u2032sqp, and distorted tetrahedral, 3\u2032Td, geometries were located, while for [Zn(HL5)2] only the distorted tetrahedral structure was found, 5\u2032Td. In both complexes, 3 and 5, the dissociation of water molecules is not energetically favoured (\u0394G values of ca. 6 kcal mol\u22121 for the dissociation toward the tetrahedral geometry), confirming the proposed octahedral structures. Furthermore, calculated NMR spectra of [Zn(HLn)2(H2O)2] species are well correlated to the experimental NMR with R2 values of 0.9954 and 0.9942, for 3 and 5, respectively (Fig. S53\u2020). As already discussed in the X-ray structural characterization, complex 4, [Zn(HL4)2]n, arranges in a monodimensional polymeric structure. To gain information about the polymerization process, the geometries of the monomer [Zn(HL4)2] with a square planar disposition and that of the dimer, [Zn(HL4)2]2, were optimized. The dimerization process is exergonic with a \u0394G value of \u22127.9 kcal mol\u22121, suggesting that the polymerization process to 4, [Zn(HL4)2]n, is accessible. Also, the trimer [Zn(HL4)2]3 was optimized, although frequency calculations were not carried out due to the high number of atoms and the limits of time computation facilities. In any case, \u0394E value of \u221253.2 kcal mol\u22121 again suggests a very favourable polymerization process. The trimer is an excellent simulation of the polymeric 4. In fact, focusing the attention on the central Zin centre with the ZnO4N2 environment the computed structural parameters fit very well with experimental. Even the stacking interaction between nitrophenyl rings is well reproduced (see Table S4\u2020). Finally, the breakup of the polymeric nature of 4, [Zn(HL4)2]n, was analysed in the presence of water to yield the monomer [Zn(HL4)2(H2O)2]. In particular, the hydration of dimer [Zn(HL4)2]2 to the [Zn(HL\n4)2(H2O)2] species is exergonic (\u0394G = \u221213.4 kcal mol\u22121), while the hydration of trimer [Zn(HL4)2]3 is analogously favourable (\u0394E = \u221256.7 kcal mol\u22121)."

Consistent with these results, complex 4, which differs from 3 being polynuclear rather than mononuclear, is more powerful than 3, especially against E. coli. Furthermore, 5 showed a bactericidal performance after the first two hours of inoculation and it was able to maintain the performance achieved during all treatment periods. In general, the performances of all compounds are more homogeneous towards S. aureus, both in terms of efficiency and time. A growth inhibition between 95% and 99% of S. aureus was achieved by compounds 1\u20135 within the first 8 hours of treatment, showing clear bacteriostatic activity. Furthermore, 1 and 2 showed bactericidal activity within 12 hours of treatment, 3 and 4 within the first 8 hours, and 5 within the first 2 hours, with 99.99% growth inhibition which remains stable even 24 hours after the test. Significantly, a different behaviour was observed towards E. coli, since 99.9% inhibition of bacterial growth was observed only by complex 5 after 8 hours, which was maintained even 24 hours after treatment, showing both bacteriostatic and bactericidal activity.\nGenerally, other Schiff base complexes reported in the literature57\u201359 display an enhanced bactericidal effect than the free ligands, according to the Overtone\u2019s concept60 and the chelation theory.61\nReactive oxygen species (ROS) detection assay\nIn order to understand a possible mechanism of action of the Zn(II) complexes, the most efficient 4 and 5 were further investigated through the ROS assay against E. coli and S. aureus. To detect the amount of ROS generated, the 2\u2032,7\u2032-dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) was used as a reagent. This reactive is deacetylated by cellular esterase to a non-fluorescent compound, which is subsequently oxidized by ROS to 2\u2032,7\u2032-dichlorofluorescein (DCF). DCF is highly fluorescent and is detected by excitation/emission fluorescence spectroscopy at 485 nm/ 535 nm. The increased generation of free radicals leads to greater stress for the bacterial cell and the increase in the fluorescence intensity in the first hours (2 h, 4 h) of treatment (Fig. 7) confirmed the generation of ROS in both bacterial strains after incubation with compounds 4 and 5. The fluorescence signal of the untreated bacterial suspension (blank) was negligible, in agreement with a generation of free radicals in both E. coli and S. aureus cells.\nPropidium iodide (PI) \u2013 viability assay\nThe viability test was performed to assess membrane damage of E. coli and S. aureus bacterial cells caused by 4 and 5, using\nFig. 6 Percentage reduction of viable E. coli cells (top) and S. aureus cells (bottom) exposed to ligands H2L 1\u2013H2L 5 (left) and Zn(II) complexes 1\u20135 (right) within 24 hours.

PI binds DNA and freely penetrates the cell membranes of dead or dying cells, but not the viable cells, allowing the evaluation of the damage in terms of permeabilization. The quantification of the damage on the bacterial cell, following the treatment with 4 and 5, was performed at different time intervals (4 h, 8 h, 12 h, 24 h) (Fig. 8). The emission of red fluorescence was determined with respect to the untreated bacterial suspension (blank). In general, it is possible to observe a moderate increase in fluorescence intensity within the first 12 hours, which is then maintained higher with respect to the blank even after 24 hours of treatment by both compounds against both bacterial strains, with a superior efficiency of complex 5 with respect to 4, thus indicating the ability of Zn(II) complexes to modify the permeability of the cell membrane by disorganizing it and leading to the death of the bacterium.\nConfocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) study\nTo further determine the overall viability of the bacterial cells the CLSM was performed.

Thus, with an appropriate mixture of both stains, bacteria with intact cell membranes stain fluorescent green, whereas bacteria with damaged membranes stain fluorescent red. The images obtained under the confocal microscope show in Fig. 9a and c, respectively, the untreated E. coli and S. aureus cells, which clearly appear to produce green fluorescence. In Fig. 9b and d, corresponding respectively to the E. coli cells treated with complex 4 and the S. aureus cells treated with complex 5, it is possible to observe a large number of bacterial cells marked with red fluorescent material. These results revealed that after treatment with complexes 4 and 5, the cell membrane of both bacterial strains is severely damaged, thus confirming the results obtained from previous assays.\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) study\nThe SEM images show the morphological alterations of the bacterial cells following the treatments with complexes 4 and 5. In Fig. 10a it is possible to observe the control sample of the S. aureus, having a round appearance with a rigid cell wall. After treatment with complex 5 (Fig. 10b), the cells are extremely smaller and have vesicular structures. Fig. 10c shows the\nFig. 7 Formation of ROS in E. coli (left) and S. aureus cells (right) exposed to Zn(II) complexes 4 and 5 for 2 and 4 hours. The data are represented as the mean \u00b1 SD of at least three separate experiments."

After treatment with complex 4 (Fig. 10d), the cells completely lose their regular surface layer,\nresulting in deformation and agglomeration. The SEM results clearly reveal the damage to the membrane permeability of bacterial cells thus confirming the results of the previous tests carried out.\nIn conclusion, all zinc(II) complexes are able to improve the antimicrobial activity toward E. coli within 12 hours and against S. aureus even within 8 hours, with complexes 4 and 5 displaying the best performances, the latter being able to completely inhibit the growth of both bacterial lines within 2 h after contact. Apart from the general greater efficacy of Zn(II) complexes against S. aureus compared to E. coli, clearly attributable to the different cell wall between these bacteria, with that of the Gram negative much thicker and more resistant, it is possible to hypothesize the effect of the different nuclearity of zinc complexes and also the ligands\u2019 structures in these distinctive activities, in fact complex 4 is a polynuclear compound where nitro groups of the ligand (HL4) interact with zinc atoms of vicinal units, while in complex 5 the ligand (HL5) is the only here reported to possess an aliphatic group (a neopentyl) instead of an aromatic one on the R1 position and a trifluoromethyl on the hydrazone fragment, both improving the lipophilic behaviour of 5, and its excellent bacterial killing ability can be related to a superior facility in crossing and disrupting the cell membrane of bacteria. The viability assay seems to confirm this hypothesis, and the results of ROS detection tests give a proof to the formation of highly reactive radicals associated with a breakdown of membrane function and cellular destruction, further confirmed by CLSM and SEM studies.\nFig. 9 Confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) images of (a) E. coli control, (b) E. coli treated with complex 4; (c) S. aureus control; (d) S. aureus treated with complex 5.\nFig. 10 Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of (a) S. aureus control, (b) S. aureus treated with complex 5, both at magnification 100.000; (c) E. coli control at magnification 25.000; (d) E. coli treated with complex 4 at magnification 40.000."

The growth curves of E. coli and S. aureus without antibacterial agents were also measured as blanks.68 All tests were done in triplicate.69\nReactive oxygen species (ROS) detection assay\nTo better evaluate the antibacterial activity of such compounds, the test for ROS measurement was carried out against the compounds 4 and 5, that showed better bacterial inhibition. To quantify the ROS generated in our system, the 2\u2032,7\u2032- dichlorofluorescein diacetate (DCFDA) assay was performed. The test protocol is based on the spread of 20 mL of DCFDA in the bacterial cultures in the range of 1\u20133 \u00d7 106 CFU mL\u22121 for 30 minutes at 37 \u00b0C. Then 10 mL are added to the Eppendorf containing 4 mg of 4 and 5 respectively, suspended in 1 mL of physiological solution. 100 \u03bcL of each Eppendorf were transferred to a 96-well plate in triplicate in the dark and ROS generation was assessed for the first two and four hours. Maintaining the same procedure, an untreated sample strain was used as a control (blank). Fluorescence from each sample well was read using the FLUOstar Omega fluorescence cytometer from BMG LABTECH at 485/20 nm and 528/20 nm wavelengths for excitation and emission respectively. The average of the triplicate was calculated and reported as the intensity of fluorescence in arbitrary unit (a.u.).\nPropidium iodide (PI) \u2013 viability assay\nTo assess the viability of bacteria treated with compounds 4 and 5, the fluorescent PI staining assay was carried out, since it allows to evaluate the level of damage related to membrane permeability. A suspension (106 CFU mL\u22121) of E. coli and S. aureus, treated with 4 mg of compounds 4 and 5, were incubated for a period of 24 h at 37 \u00b0C. After 4 h, 8 h, 12 h, and 24 h, 100 \u03bcL of the content was transferred in triplicate into 96-well plate in the dark and 1,5 mL of Propidium Iodide (PI) was added in each well. Maintaining the same procedure, an untreated sample strain was used as a control (blank). Fluorescence emitted by the cells was read using the FLUOstar Omega fluorescence cytometer from BMG LABTECH at 485/ 20 nm and 528/20 nm wavelengths for excitation and emission respectively. The average of the triplicate was calculated and reported as the intensity of fluorescence in arbitrary unit (a. u.).\nConfocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM) study\nTo determine the damaging effect of 4 and 5 on the cell membranes of S. aureus and E. coli, CM analysis was carried out with LIVE/DEAD\u00ae BacLight\u2122 Bacterial Viability Kits (Invitrogen), which utilize mixtures of SYTO\u00ae9 green-fluorescent nucleic acid stain and propidium iodide (PI) red-fluorescent nucleic acid stain. Briefly, a bacterial suspension in the range of 1 \u00d7 108 CFU mL\u22121 (\u223c0.03 OD670) for E. coli and 1 \u00d7 107 CFU mL\u22121 (\u223c0.15 OD670) for S. aureus were treated with 4 mg of 4 and 5 during the logarithmic growth phase for 4 h. After the incubation period, suspensions were concentrated by cen-\ntrifugation at 10 000g for 10\u201315 minutes, then the supernatant was removed and the pellet resuspended in 0.85% NaCl solution. Afterwards, equal volumes of Syto-9 and Propidium iodide were added to all samples and incubated for 15 min in the absence of light. Samples were then fixed between a slide and an 18 mm square coverslip to observe the fluorescence under confocal microscope (Nikon ECLIPSE Ti). The control assay was conducted without treatment. The excitation/emission maxima for these dyes are about 480/500 nm for SYTO 9 stain and 490/635 nm for PI.\nScanning electron microscopy (SEM) study\nThe morphology of the bacterial cells after treating with 4 and 5 was determined by SEM (Sigma 300, Zeiss) operating at 15.0 kV, Bruker. For SEM sample preparation, log phase cells of E. coli and S. aureus (106 CFUs) were incubated with 4 mg of complexes 4 and 5 for 4 hours at 37 \u00b0C. After incubation period, bacterial strains were centrifugated (2000g \u00d7 5 min), washed thrice with physiological solution and fixed with 200 \u03bcL of 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde solution for 2 hours on glass slide. The fixed pellets were washed twice with physiological solution, then were immersed in a solution with increasing concentrations of ethanol (10, 30, 50, 70, 90 and 100%), 5 min for each concentration. After drying, samples were placed on aluminium stubs using self-adhesive carbon conductive tab and chrome-coated. The untreated bacterial cells were taken as control."

Then, five new zinc(II) complexes have been synthesized and characterized in the solid state and solution. Complexes 1 and 2 are mononuclear anhydrous compounds, while 3 and 5 are mononuclear diaqua compounds. Remarkable is the result of the X-ray studies on compound 4, showing a polynuclear species assembled through involvement of nitro groups of the ligand (HL4)\u2212 in the interaction with zinc atoms of vicinal units. These interactions are however weak and long, with a Zn\u2013O distance of 2.342(3) \u00c5, as compared to the Zn\u2013O distances of the carbonyl oxygen of pyrazolone moiety, which is equal to 2.004 (3) \u00c5. This evidence allows us to rationalize how such weak interactions of nitro groups can be easily broken even in chlorinated solution, where 4 is soluble, or they can be replaced by molecules of water or alcohols during the synthesis in methanol, as for compound 3 which is instead isolated as a molecular diaqua compound. The theoretical DFT study have been used to rationalize the structures experimentally found (for example, polymeric nature of 4), to support the spectroscopical assignments (IR and NMR) and to have a better knowledge of the behaviour of pyrazolone-based hydrazones as ligands in coordination chemistry.
