    "abstractText": "This review summarized the current breakthroughs in the chemistry of acridines as anticancer agents, including new structural and biologically active acridine attributes. Acridine derivatives are a class of compounds that are being extensively researched as potential anti-cancer drugs. Acridines are well-known for their high cytotoxic activity; however, their clinical application is restricted or even excluded as a result of side effects. The photocytotoxicity of propyl acridine acts against leukaemia cell lines, with C1748 being a promising anti-tumour drug against UDPUGT\u2019s. CK0403 is reported in breast cancer treatment and is more potent than CK0402 against estrogen receptor-negative HER2. Acridine platinum (Pt) complexes have shown specificity on the evaluated DNA sequences; 9-anilinoacridine core, which intercalates DNA, and a methyl triazene DNA-methylating moiety were also studied. Acridine thiourea gold and acridinone derivatives act against cell lines such as MDA-MB-231, SK-BR-3, and MCF-7. Benzimidazole acridine compounds demonstrated cytotoxic activity against Dual Topo and PARP-1. Quinacrine, thiazacridine, and azacridine are reported as anti-cancer agents, which have been reported in the previous decade and were addressed in this review article.",

Introduction\nMalignant tumours are commonly referred to as cancer. Malignant tumours are the world\u2019s most serious threat to human health. Cancer is derived from the Latin word for crab. Although this is a common term, the scientific term for cancer is neoplasia, which means \u201cnew formation\u201d in Greek. The term \u201cmalignant neoplasm\u201d refers to a new growth that contains pathogenic or harmful features that can be seen in the body. It can destroy vital organs, as well as, in some cases, create life-threatening disruptions in the functioning of the body. In 1870, Graebe and Caro discovered a solid, crystalline, and base compound as a type of raw, impure anthracene extracted from coal tar. The chemical was given the name acridine because of its irritating impact on the skin. Acridine is also known by the names dibenzo[b,e]pyridine,benzo[b]quinolone, 2,3,5,6-dibenzopyridine, and 10-azaanthracene. Acridine analogues have been investigated as potential cancer therapy agents, with a focus on DNA and DNA-related enzymes such as topoisomerases, telomerase, and others. Amsacrine, the most well-known anti-cancer acridine medication, applied against acute\nMolecules 2023, 28, 193. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28010193 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 193 2 of 42\nleukaemia and its derivatives can affect topoisomerase 2 and other intracellular targets in a variety of ways. One of the milestones in the history of the acridines was the development of the antitumour agents Ledakrin and Acriflavine in 1912. Quinacrine, used for apoptotic and anti-apoptotic genes, was evaluated. Several 9-aminoacridine derivatives cleave the acridine ring in the presence of primary aliphatic amines, especially in the course of solidphase synthesis; investigations have shown that the \u03b1-amino group in peptides is a weak acridine acceptor, whereas the \u03b5-amino group of lysine is a moderate acridine acceptor. The biological activity of acridines is mostly due to their aromatic structure planarity, which allows them to interact with the DNA structure via intercalation. This study outlined recent breakthroughs in acridine chemical properties, with a focus on the last decade. The reactivity of the acridine ring as well as the synthesis of 9-substituted acridines as anti-cancer agents and the mechanisms of the reaction occurring at the position of 9 or 10 of 9-substituted acridines were reviewed. The potential of acridine carboxamide platinum complexes as anti-cancer agents was also addressed. As acridines constitute a class of compounds of considerable pharmaceutical interest, their biological activities were summarised. As mentioned, this critical review discussed the current progress in the novel 9- substituted acridine heterocyclic compounds. Acridine shows various biological activities (anti-bacterial, anti-parasitic, anti-viral etc.), whereas in this review, acridine\u2019s anti-tumour activity is particularly discussed. Additionally, to address the cytotoxicity of various acridine derivatives, IC50 values are given in a table. This overview is not exhaustive; instead, it highlights some recent examples of acridines, which are biologically active chemicals, and certain applications of technically or biotechnologically interesting acridines as well as various reactions on the acridine ring (Figure 1).\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 2 of 44\nAcridine analogues have been investigated as potential cancer therapy agents, with a o-\ncus on DNA and DNA-related enzymes such as topoisomerases, telomerase, and others.\nAmsacrine, the most well-known anti-cancer acridine medication, applied against acute\nleukaemia and its derivatives can affect topoisomerase 2 and other intracellular targets in\na variety of ways.

The current research aimed to learn more about its metabolisation by phase II enzymes called UDPglucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) as well as its potential for being involved in drug\u2013drug interactions caused by UGT regulation [3].\nMolecules 2023, 28, 193 3 of 42\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 44\nresearch aimed to learn more about its metabolisation by phase II enzymes called UDP-\nglucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) as well as its potential for being involved in drug\u2013drug\ninteractions caused by UGT regulation [3].\nCompound-induced cell-cycle arrest and cell death in human lung adenocarcinoma\ncells, Ataxia telangiectasia kinase, was initiated by all compounds, and histone H2A.X\nwas phosphorylated at Ser139, indicating damage to DNA.

The anti-tumour effects of the new spiro-acridine (E)-50-oxo-10-((3,4,5-tri-\nmethoxybenzylidene)amino)-10,50-dihydro-10H-spiro[acridine-9,20-pyrrole]40-carboni-\ntrile (AMTAC-17) were investigated.

The novel synthetic lanthanum compound bis (acridine-9-carboxylate)-nitro-europium (III) dehydrate had anti-angiogenic and apoptotic effects in an animal model of carcinogenesis [9]. The anti-cancer drug 9-a ino-1-nitroacridine (C-1748), developed in a laboratory setting, is a treatment option for pancreatic cancer. It involves the P450 3A4 isoenzyme and cytochrome P450 reductase (CPR), and the response\u2019s modulation was investigated in the Panc-1, Mi PaCa-2, BxPC-3, and AsPC-1 cell lines of pancreatic cancer, which differed in terms of their expression levels and typically altered this cancer type\u2019s ge es. C-1748 had t e strongest cytotoxic action against MiaPaCa-2 cells, but AsPC-1 cell , on the other h d, were the most resistant (IC50: 0.015, 0.075 M, respectively) [10]. Allosteric regulatio of the a1Aand a1B-adre ergic receptors w s demonstrated by a variety of 9-aminoacridine comp und . The 9-aminoacridine accelerate [3H] prazosin segregati from a1A- and a1B-adrenergic receptors and block receptor stimulation by the endogenous agonist norepinephrine in a non-competitive manner [11]. AT11-L0, which is generated from the AT11 DNA sequence, creates a single main parallel G-quadruplex (G4) conformation, and has\nMolecules 2023, 28, 193 4 of 42\nanti-proliferative properties comparable to AT11 and AS1411 aptamers. Acridine orange derivatives, on the other hand, are a useful class of G4 ligands. Researchers tested AT11-L0 G4 as a supramolecular transporter for delivering acridine ligands C3, C5, and C8 to HeLa carcinoma cells in ref. [12]. The inhibitory activity of new acridine-based N-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) analogues has been examined in SAS (human oral squamous carcinoma cell line). At 5.3\u201310.6 M, one analogue caused G2/M phase arrest, while at a higher dose (21.2 M), it caused polyploidy [13]. A new class of acridine hydroxamic acid compounds was developed and produced as a potential new dual Topo and HDAC inhibitor. MTT studies revealed that each and every hybrid compound had substantial anti-proliferative effects with IC50 values in the low micromolar range, with compound 8c showing particularly strong action against U937 (IC50 = 0.90 M). It was also discovered that compound 8c had the best HDAC inhibitory action, being several times more effective than the HDAC inhibitor SAHA. At 50 micrograms, all of the substances inhibited Topo II according to subsequent tests. Furthermore, compound 8c had the potential to interact with DNA, resulting in apoptosis in U937 cells [14]. The authors designed and synthesised a unique small-molecule library with numerous modifications and replacements based on the CQ structure and an acridine skeleton, and then evaluated the molecules for efficient autophagy inhibition. They discovered that 9-chloro-2-(3-(dimethylamino) propyl) pyrrolo [2,3,4-kl] acridin-1(2H)-one (LS-1-10) was the most efficient inhibitor of autophagic-mediated degradation from their database, and that it could reduce the viability of various colon cancer cells [15]. DNA-intercalating agents are novel hetero-aromatic compounds with a cytotoxic moiety. Two iodinated acridine derivatives have been found to have a favourable in vivo kinetic profile for use in targeted radionuclide therapy. The goal of this research was to evaluate these drugs in a preclinical setting. Finally, an acridine derivative with increased nuclear localisation was shown to be a better option for 125I-targeted radionuclide therapy [16]. Based on the pharmacological characteristics of B16F0 tumours in mice, for melanomatargeted 125I radionuclide therapy, two melanin-targeting radioligands were developed: [125I] ICF01035 and [125I] ICF01040. Researchers demonstrated in vitro that these compounds have different radiotoxicities in connection with melanin and the acidic vesicle contents in B16F0, B16F0 PTU, and A375 cell lines. ICF01040 was detected in the cytoplasmic vesicles of both types of melanomas, whereas ICF01035 was located in the nuclei of achromic (A375) and the melanosomes of melanised (B16F0) melanoma cells. In all cell lines, [125I] ICF01035 caused a similar survival fraction (A50) and a considerable drop in S-phase cells in amelanotic cell lines. In vivo, [125I] ICF01035 dramatically decreased the amount of B16F0 lung colonies, allowing the treated mice to live longer. Melanosomes or acidic vesicles could possibly be used to treat melanoma in the future [17]. An anti-cancer agent, 9-phenyl acridine (ACPH), was used. Normal cells, such as human lymphocytes and Chinese hamster V79 cells, were more susceptible to ACPH than A375 and HeLa, two human cancer cell lines. ACPH has been found to be a promising cancer chemotherapeutic agent. Through a mitochondria-mediated caspase-dependent route, ACPH administration caused cells to die apoptotically [18]. Nine different tetrahydroacridine derivatives containing an iodobenzoic moiety were produced and cancer cell lines were examined for cytotoxicity A549 (human lung adenocarcinoma), HT-29 (human colorectal adenocarcinoma), and EA.hy926 (human somatic cell line) (human umbilical vein cell line). All substances were more cytotoxic than the control agent etoposide, and 5-fluorouracil against A 549 (IC50 59.12\u201314.87 M) and HT-29 (IC50 17.32\u20135.90 M) cell lines [19]. The biological activities of 9-(2-(1-arylethylidene) hydrazinyl) acridine and its synthetic derivatives were designed, synthesised, and analysed. The free radical scavenging capacity of the produced compounds (4a\u20134j) was determined using a variety of biochemical tests. These chemicals were tested for anti-cancer efficacy in comparison with two human cancer cell lines, cervical cancer cells (HeLa) and liver cancer cells (HepG2), as well as a normal human embryonic kidney cell line (HEK 293) [20]. 9-phenylacridine (ACPH), an acridine derivative, was discovered to have anti-cancer action in both cell lines and an in vivo model.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 193 5 of 42\nResearchers used photo-cleavage experiment to look at the effects of ACPH on in vitro DNA before UVA exposure. In cultivated A375 melanoma cells, the effect of such treatment was also investigated. ACPH could sensitise UVA-induced DNA damage in vitro and in cells, according to their findings [21]. A family of acridine derivatives as effective and selective inhibitors of the IRE1-XBP1 branch of the UPR with substantial cytotoxicity on MM cells as well as in vivo MM tumour growth using TDA analysis on HTS was discovered [22]. N0-(2chloro-6-methoxy-acridin-9-yl)-2-cyano-3-(4-dimethylaminophenyl)-acrilohidrazida was synthesised and its toxicity and anti-cancer efficacy were assessed (ACS-AZ10). In vivo, ACS-AZ10 shows a significant anti-cancer effect and is quite safe [23]. EGFR and PKCs are inhibited by acridine yellow G, as a result of which cell development is inhibited, cell-cycle arrest occurs in the G1phase, brain tumours shrink. Acridine yellow G has IC50 values of 7.5 and 5 M for EGFR and PKCs, respectively [24]. New promising unsymmetrical bisacridine derivatives (UAs) have been created. The condensation of 4-nitro or 4-methylacridinone, imidazoacridinone, and triazoloacridinone derivatives with 1-nitroacridine molecules connected with an aminoalkyl chain yielded three groups of 36 compounds. The great effectiveness of these compounds against many tumour cell lines was discovered by cytotoxicity testing [25]. A one-pot four-component cyclo-condensation of dimedone for the synthesis of 9- aryl-hexahydro-acridine-1,8-diones that is easy, efficient, and cost-effective against the HepG2 and MCF-7 cell lines, and some of the acridine-diones synthesised were discovered to have promising anti-cancer activity [26]. Four mesothelioma cell lines to assess the anti-proliferative effect of a variety of acridine-based catalytic inhibitors of hTopo II (H513, H2372, H2461, and H2596) were applied. The results showed that these compounds inhibited malignant cell proliferation with EC50 values ranging from 6.9 to 32 M. The Guava Nexin assay and PARP cleavage data showed that apoptosis is the primary reason for cell apoptosis. The results support earlier research on pancreatic cancer and hTopo II catalytic inhibitors, suggesting that substituted acridines may be effective in the treatment of malignant mesothelioma [27]. The synthesis and pharmacological assessment of a set of bifunctional acridine-HSP90 (Cpd: 2.1.23) inhibitor ligands as telomerase inhibitors were reported. Using a clickchemistry technique, four hybrid acridine-HSP90 inhibitor conjugates were created and demonstrated to have comparable effects in the TRAP-LIG telomerase test to the wellknown telomerase inhibitor BRACO-19. The conjugates also showed significant cytotoxity in the sub-M range against a variety of cancer cell lines [28]. The interaction of three novel diphenyl-substituted spiro triazolidine- and thiazolidinone-acridines (Cpd: 2.1.24) with calf thymus DNA was studied using UV-vis, fluorescence, circular dichroism spectroscopy, and viscometry [29]. Early investigations were conducted on the amino acid-attached acridines as potential anti-cancer medication leads. The chemicals have substantial anti-proliferative effect, as evidenced by the MTT assay, phase contrast micrographs, and Confocal pictures of immunelabelled C6 Glioma cells for markers such as a-tubulin, GFAP, mortalin, and HSP-70 cells. Flow cytometry data revealed that the chemicals also stopped cells in the G0/G1 phase of the cell cycle [30]. A novel family of tri-substituted acridines that would imitate the actions of BRACO19 was described. These compounds were made by adding heteroacyclic moieties to the BRACO19 molecular structure at positions 3 and 6. The human telomeric DNA quadruplex was stabilised by all of the studied derivatives. The novel derivatives were all capable of folding single-stranded DNA sequences into anti-parallel G-quadruplex structures according to the findings. When compared with the HT 29 cancer cell line, the studied compounds were less harmful to human fibroblast cells [31]. When a non-covalent contact such as intercalation is used, the synthesis of DNA\u2013 polymer hybrids is simple. The exact structure and characteristics of the polymer play a significant role in the strength of the connection. The production of discrete, well-defined nanoparticles can be carried out by simply combing the components together in an aqueous solution and utilising a DNA sequence of specific length [32]. CuGGHK-Acr, a novel\nMolecules 2023, 28, 193 6 of 42\nDNA-cleaving agent that uses a catalytic metallo drug to target G4 telomeric DNA, was reported. CuGGHK-Acr can selectively bind to G4 telomeric DNA in comparison with CTDNA and facilitate an effective irreversible cleavage of G4 telomeric DNA in comparison with telomeric DNA in other structural states, according to these findings [33]. The antiproliferative properties of a series of 9-benzyl acridine derivatives were investigated. At 100 M, each and every compound mentioned had substantial Topo II inhibitory action. Through a caspase-dependent intrinsic mechanism, the usual chemical 8p demonstrated significant DNA-binding capacity, generated DNA double-strand breaks, and promoted death in A549 cells (Table 1 and Figure 3) [34].\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 6 of 44\nderivatives were all capable of folding single-stranded DNA sequences into anti-parallel\nG-quadruplex structures according to the findings.

The DNA-reactive inhibitor of topoisomerase II imidazoacridinone C-1311 has previously been proven to be a strong and selective inhibitor of recombinant FLT3. Researchers investig ted the effect on leukaemia cells with wild-type FLT3, FLT3-ITD mutant, a d no FLT3 receptor to add to their fi dings. It was reported that more preclinical and clinical research into its potency against the FLT3-ITD kinase is warranted (Table 9) [70].\nTable 9.

Cell proliferation was inhibited 80- and 150-fold at nanomolar doses in pancreatic (PANC1) and non-small-cell lung (NSCLC, NCI-H460) cancer cells, respectively [80]. A platinum\u2013acridine hybrid agent [PtCl(en)(L)](NO3)2 (complex 1, en = ethane-1,2diamine, L = 1-[2-(acridin-9-ylamino)ethyl]-1,3-dimethylthiourea was studied using a combination of biophysical, biochemical, and computational techniques to determine mechanistic distinctions between it and a much more effective second-generation analogue. N-methylpropionamidine is a specific type of N-methylpropionamidine [81]. Five NSCLC cell lines were resynthesised and assessed, indicating big cell, squamous cell, and adenocarcinomas. 7-Aminobenz[c] acridine was identified as a promising scaffold in a hybrid drug (P1\u2013B1) and showed 32-fold enhanced tolerability in mice compared with the parent platinum\u2013acridine (P1\u2013A1) while maintaining sub-micromolar activity in numerous DNA-repair-proficient and p53-mutant cancer models [82]. Binds generated by the platinum\u2013acridine agent [Pt Cl(en)(N-(2-(acridin-9-ylamino)ethyl)N-methylpropionimidamide)] were structurally characterised using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in combination with electrospray mass spectrometry (LC-ESMS).

Thiazacridine\nThree novel thiazacridine compounds were synthesised and their anti-proliferative activities were evaluated. Three new thiazacridine compounds were produced and described using a three-step synthetic reaction: (Z)-5-acridin-9-ylmethylene-3-(4-methyl-benzyl)4-thioxo-thiazolidin-2-one (LPSF/AC-99), (Z)-5-acridin-9-ylmethylene-3-(4-chloro-benzyl)-4thioxo-thiazolidin-2-one (LPSF/AC-119), and (Z)-5-acridin-9-ylmethylene-3-. Colorimetric assays were used to test toxicity and selectivity. According to the findings, none of the chemicals were toxic to normal human cells and caused neoplastic cell death primarily through apoptosis [92]. A novel cytotoxic drug with acridine and thiazolidine nuclei the cytotoxic activity of four ATZDs was examined in human colon cancer HCT-8 cells: (5Z)5-acridin-9-ylmethylene-3-(4-methylbenzyl)-thiazolidine-2,4-dione-AC-4; (5ZE)-5-acridin-9ylmethylene-3-(4-methylbenzyl)-thiazolidine-2,4-dione-AC-4 -3-(4-bromobenzyl)thiazolidine2,4-dione-AC-7;(5Z) -5-(acridin-9-ylmethylene) -3-(4-chlorobenzyl) -3-(4-chlorobenzyl)-1,3thiazolidine-2,4-dione-AC-10; and -1,3-thiazolidine-2,4-dione-AC-10 (5ZE) AC-23 is a -5- (acridin-9-ylmethylene)-3-(4-fluoro-benzyl)-1,3-thiazolidine-2,4-dione. All of the ATZDs tested inhibited HCT-8 cell proliferation in a concentration- and time-dependent manner. According to the findings, ATZD inhibited the activity of DNA Topo isomerase I and affected tumour cell apoptosis via apoptotic pathways [93]. A number of novel thiazacridine compounds have been produced and tested as anti-cancer agents, both in terms of cytotoxicity and selectivity. All compounds had cytotoxic activity and selectivity according to the cytotoxicity assay. The most promising molecule was 3-acridin-9-ylmethyl-5-(5-bromo-1H-indol3ylmethylene)-thiazolidine-2,4-dione (LPSF/AA29\u20147a), with IC50 values ranging from 0.25 to 68.03 mM depending on cell lineage. In HepG2 cells, the IC50 value for -thiazolidine-2,4-dione (LPSF/AA36\u20147b; 46.95 mM) was the lowest. None of the produced compounds were shown to be harmful to normal cells (IC50 > 100 mM) [94]. In several cancer cell lines, thiazacridine and imidazacridine derivatives have shown promise as tumour suppressors. That was the case in binding studies of 5-acridin-9-ylmethylidene-3amino-2thioxo-thiazolidin-4-one, 5-acridin-9-ylmethylidene-2-thioxo-thiazolidin-4-one, 5-acridin9ylmethylidene-2-thioxo-imidazolidin-4-one, and 3-acridin-9-ylmethylidene-2-thioxo-imid, except for 5-acridin-9-ylmethylidene-2-thioxo-1,3-thiazolidin-4-one, which showed inhibitory activity\nMolecules 2023, 28, x FOR PEER REVIEW 38 of 49\nMolecules 2023, 28, 193 32 of 42\nTable 14.

The representative 13b inhibited EGFR and Src activity, as well as tumour-cell invasion and apoptosis [96]. A variety of novel azaacridine analogues with a basic side chain were produced and their anti-proliferative efficacy was tested.

Conclusions\nSince the 1980s, several acridine derivatives have been synthesised and tested for anti-cancer efficacy. In recent years, the effective synthesis and anti-cancer efficacy of these nitrogen-containing heterocyclic moieties has been a point of interest. However, it has failed to treat cancer and hence falls short of our expectations and needs. In the coming years, a significant increase is feasible, but it will be contingent on the specialised design of compounds that target a single receptor, enzyme, or protein, with a focus on minimising side effects and toxicity. It is necessary to synthesise more of these heterocyclic compounds that target enzymes in order to modulate illness conditions. To summarise, the development of compounds containing an acridine nucleus is an attractive and promising area of medicinal chemistry, and pharmacophores containing this heterocyclic ring have the potential to contribute to the discovery of new biologically active drugs.\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualisation, P.V and K.R.
