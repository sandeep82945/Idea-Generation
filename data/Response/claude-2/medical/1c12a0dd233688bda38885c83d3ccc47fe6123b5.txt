 Here are 5 potential future research ideas based on the paper:

1. Further explore the mechanisms by which NANOG regulates PDK1 and the PI3K/AKT pathway in cancer stem cells. The current study suggests NANOG may modulate PDK1 expression, but more research is needed on the precise interactions and downstream effects. 

2. Investigate combination therapies using shRNA targeting NANOG/OCT4 with other chemotherapeutic agents besides temozolomide. Determine if silencing these genes can sensitize cancer stem cells to other standard drugs.

3. Examine whether targeting NANOG/OCT4 can inhibit tumor growth and improve survival in vivo using animal models of glioblastoma. This would provide important preclinical data on the therapeutic potential.

4. Analyze the effects of suppressing NANOG/OCT4 on other stemness and drug resistance pathways in cancer stem cells, beyond PI3K/AKT. Expanding the understanding of their regulatory roles.  

5. Develop optimized delivery methods to target shRNA or other inhibitors against NANOG/OCT4 specifically to cancer stem cells while avoiding normal cells. This could involve nanoparticle carriers, cell-specific promoters, or local delivery.
