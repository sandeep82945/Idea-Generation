Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) is the primary reason for cancer-related deaths in the US. Genetic mutations, drug resistance, the involvement of multiple signaling pathways, cancer stem cells (CSCs), and desmoplastic stroma, which hinders drug penetrance, contribute to poor chemotherapeutic efficacy. Hence, there is a need to identify novel drugs with improved delivery to improve treatment outcomes. Curcumin is one such compound that can inhibit multiple signaling pathways and CSCs. However, curcumin’s clinical applicability for treating PDAC is limited because of its poor solubility in water and metabolic instability. Hence, we developed a difluorinated curcumin (CDF) analog that accumulates selectively in the pancreas and inhibits PDAC growth in vitro and in vivo. In the present work, we developed its 2-hydroxy-propyl-β-cyclodextrin (HCD) inclusion complex to increase its water solubility and hydrolytic stability. The CDFHCD inclusion complex was characterized by spectroscopic, thermal, and microscopic techniques. The inclusion complex exhibited increased aqueous solubility, hydrolytic stability, and antiproliferative activity compared to parent CDF. Moreover, CDF and CDFHCD inhibited colony and spheroid formation, and induced cell cycle and apoptosis in PDAC cell lines. Hence, CDFHCD self-assembly is an efficient approach to increase water solubility and anticancer therapeutic efficacy, which now warrants advancement towards a clinical proof of concept in PDAC patients. 1. conclusions In the present study, we successfully prepared and characterized the inclusion complex of CDF with 2-hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin, CDF–HCD. CDFHCD treatment demonstrated greater anti-proliferative effects against PDAC cell lines compared to CDF treatment alone. CDF and CDFHCD inhibited colony and spheroid formation, producing cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in PDAC cell lines. Moreover, HCD improved the hydrolytic stability of CDF. Int. J. Mol.
