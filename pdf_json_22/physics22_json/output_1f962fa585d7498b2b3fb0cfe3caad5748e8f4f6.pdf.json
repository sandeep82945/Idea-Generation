    "abstractText": "We study particle transport through a chain of coupled sites connected to free-fermion reservoirs at both ends, subjected to a local particle loss. The transport is characterized by calculating the conductance and particle density in the steady state using the Keldysh formalism for open quantum systems. In addition to a reduction of conductance, we find that transport can remain (almost) unaffected by the loss for certain values of the chemical potential in the lattice. We show that this \u201cprotected\u201d transport results from the spatial symmetry of single-particle eigenstates. At a finite voltage, the density profile develops a drop at the lossy site, connected to the onset of nonballistic transport.",

Kollath1 1Physikalisches Institut, University of Bonn, Nussallee 12, 53115 Bonn, Germany\n2Department of Quantum Matter Physics, University of Geneva, 24 quai Ernest-Ansermet, 1211 Geneva, Switzerland\n(Received 25 January 2022; accepted 31 May 2022; published 26 July 2022)\nWe study particle transport through a chain of coupled sites connected to free-fermion reservoirs at both ends, subjected to a local particle loss. The transport is characterized by calculating the conductance and particle density in the steady state using the Keldysh formalism for open quantum systems. In addition to a reduction of conductance, we find that transport can remain (almost) unaffected by the loss for certain values of the chemical potential in the lattice. We show that this \u201cprotected\u201d transport results from the spatial symmetry of single-particle eigenstates. At a finite voltage, the density profile develops a drop at the lossy site, connected to the onset of nonballistic transport.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevLett.129.056802\nOver the decades, dissipative processes have been considered a nuisance in quantum systems since they destroy the essential property\u2014quantum coherence. This usually has detrimental consequences for applications such as quantum computing. Recently, this point of view was revisited and reversed so that dissipative processes are now employed as a tool to bring quantum systems into desired states with novel features [1]. For example, a dissipative coupling was used to prepare phase- and number-squeezed states with ultracold atoms [2], a Tonks-Girardeau gas of molecules [3], and even entanglement among trapped ions [4], while environment-assisted quantum transport [5\u20137] was demonstrated using dephasing noise. Dissipation is usually understood as irreversible energy loss due to coupling to an environment. Among dissipative mechanisms, the loss of particles plays an important role. Experiments with cold atoms offer a platform to engineer and study particle losses in a controlled way. One realization was to apply an electron beam to weakly interacting bosonic gases [8,9], paving the way to the study of new phenomena. Theoretically, the influence of a localized loss or dephasing has been studied extensively for weakly interacting bosonic atoms [10,11] and the Bose-Hubbard model [12\u201314]. For fermionic systems, less is known, and only recently, a local particle loss was realized in a coldatom experiment using near-resonant optical tweezers [15,16]. Theoretical analyses [17\u201320] have shown evidence for a quantum Zeno effect [21,22], where the interplay of the interaction and loss pushes the system to a new steady\nstate with peculiar properties, different from the equilibrium ones. Given the striking effects of particle losses when the system is otherwise in equilibrium, it is important to understand their consequences in a system that is already in a nonthermal steady state. Such steady states occur quite generally when a system is coupled to two reservoirs at different chemical potentials, leading to the transport of matter [23\u201325]. Steady-state transport is one of most common probes of the properties of quantum systems and has been extensively applied in the condensed-matter context. In solid-state junctions, a loss or gain of electrons can be implemented through additional leads\u2014this technique was applied to controlling supercurrents in Josephson junctions [26\u201329]. More recently, particle transport between reservoirs has been studied in cold-atom experiments [30], where the effects of local particle losses on transport were also explored [15]. Understanding the consequences of particle losses in a nonequilibrium steady state, as opposed to equilibrium, is thus prompted by recent experiments but is also interesting from a theoretical point of view. This novel situation poses new conceptual problems since it combines two different ways to push the system out of equilibrium. So far, it has been treated by approximate methods, such as incorporating an imaginary potential in the Landauer-B\u00fcttiker formula of transport [15] or describing the reservoirs by Lindblad boundary conditions [31\u201333]. A full analysis is clearly difficult and yet little explored. In this Letter, we address the effects of losses on the transport through a quantum dot or an extended lattice coupled to two reservoirs. We use a full Keldysh description, allowing for an exact solution. We obtain both the conductance of the lossy system and the density profile in the presence of losses and a finite voltage. Surprisingly, the conductance can be robust to losses, which we relate to the Published by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

We show that, for intermediate to large losses, a voltage drop occurs across the dissipative defect in contrast to the ballistic behavior of a lossless system. We consider a one-dimensional lattice coupled at both ends to a free-fermion reservoir and subjected to a local particle loss at the center (see Fig. 1). The system without the loss is described by the Hamiltonian H \u00bcPi\u00bcL;R Hi \u00feHchain \u00feHt. The subscripts L and R denote the left and right reservoirs, respectively, with the Hamiltonian Hi \u00bc P k \u00f0\u03f5k \u2212 \u03bci\u00de\u03c8\u2020ik\u03c8 ik. Here, k denotes a quantum number (typically momentum), \u03f5k is the energy, and \u03c8\u2020ik (\u03c8 ik) is the fermionic creation (annihilation) operator of reservoir i. The chemical potentials \u03bci are, in general, different. We assume that the reservoirs have a constant density of states. The dispersion relation is thus linear, \u03f5k \u00bc vF\u00f0k \u2212 kF\u00de, with the Fermi velocity vF and Fermi momentum kF. We set \u210f \u00bc 1 for simplicity.

[33,37] for details), I \u00bc \u2212 1\n2 \u00f0d=dt\u00dehNL \u2212 NRi,\nwhere Ni \u00bc R dr\u03c8\u2020i \u00f0r\u00de\u03c8\u2020i \u00f0r\u00de is the particle number operator. One can compute the full nonlinear current-voltage characteristics from the above action, but we focus on the conductance G \u00bc limV\u21920I=V, where V \u00bc \u03bcL \u2212 \u03bcR is the voltage, and fix \u03bcL;R \u00bc V=2. In natural units, the conductance quantum is G0 \u00bc 1=\u00f02\u03c0\u00de. In the case of a quantum dot coupled to reservoirs (M \u00bc 1), only \u03b30 is present. The conductance is\nGdot \u00bc 1\n2\u03c0 4\u0393\u00f0\u03b30 \u00fe 4\u0393\u00de 4\u03f52 \u00fe \u00f0\u03b30 \u00fe 4\u0393\u00de2 ; \u00f07\u00de\nwhere \u0393 \u00bc \u03c0\u03c10\u03c421, and \u03c10 is the constant density of states per unit volume of the reservoirs. For \u03b30 \u00bc 0, Gdot is a Lorentzian function with width 4\u0393. Its maximum occurs when the energy level of the quantum dot \u03f5 coincides with the chemical potential in the reservoirs, here at \u03f5 \u00bc 0. At this value, the system is perfectly conducting with Gdot \u00bc G0 and the conductance is independent of the tunneling \u03c41. A particle loss leads to a reduction of the maximum and a broadening of the Lorentzian peak, seen in Fig. 2(a). For a lattice ofM sites, there areM such resonances [33] of the conductance, as seen for M \u00bc 5, 7, and 9 in Figs. 2(b)\u20132(d). The horizontal axis is restricted to positive \u03f5 since G\u00f0\u03f5\u00de is an even function. To gain insight into the positions of the resonances, we consider the single-particle eigenstates of an isolated (\u03c41 \u00bc 0) lattice. There are M eigenstates with eigenenergies symmetric around \u03f5. The resonances occur approximately when an eigenenergy En coincides with the chemical potential in the reservoirs, here when En \u00bc 0. The eigenenergies are indicated with vertical lines in Figs. 2(b)\u20132(d). Whereas the number of maxima can be fully understood by this consideration, their positions are only exact in the \u03c41 \u2192 0 limit; the eigenenergies of the chain are shifted when it is coupled to reservoirs. This deviation is visible in Fig. 2 where \u03c41 \u00bc 0.5. Quite remarkably, even if the maxima are shifted for \u03c41 > 0, the conductance at the maxima is perfect,G=G0 \u00bc 1, in the absence of particle loss. This was checked for lattice sizes M \u00bc 3 to 9 [37].\nWhile a loss at the center site reduces the conductance peaks, every second peak is only very weakly reduced, as seen in Figs. 2(b) and 2(c). This interesting behavior stems from the fact that, for an isolated lattice, half of the eigenstates are antisymmetric and have a node at the center where the particle loss takes place. Particles in antisymmetric eigenstates are therefore not depleted by the loss [17] and transport through these eigenstates\u2014at values of \u03f5 where an eigenenergy coincides with the chemical potential of the reservoirs\u2014is only weakly affected. Symmetric eigenstates, on the other hand, are depleted due to the nonzero overlap with the lossy site. This leads, as for the quantum dot, to a reduction of conductance. When an extended loss is present, as in Fig. 2(d), all eigenstates are depleted even in the \u03c41 \u2192 0 limit since they cannot have a node on three neighboring sites. However, for \u03b31 < \u03b30 and moderate values of \u03b30, the maxima arising from symmetric eigenstates are still reduced more than the ones from antisymmetric eigenstates. Interestingly, for a lattice of nine sites, a larger \u03b30 leads to a reinforcement of the peak at \u03f5 \u00bc 0. Resonances close to the edges of the spectrum are also preserved, while the others are suppressed. The outermost resonances preserved at large \u03b30 arise from\np\n, while \u03f5, \u03c4, and\n\u03b3j have dimension 1=V. The peak is reduced and broadened with \u03b30 > 0. We plot only the \u03f5 > 0 region since G\u00f0\u2212\u03f5\u00de \u00bc G\u00f0\u03f5\u00de.

For even l (one, five, and nine sites), there is a faster decay than for odd l (three and seven sites), explained by the spatial symmetry of the relevant eigenstates. For \u03b31 > 0, a faster decay occurs for odd and a nonmonotonic dependence for even l (see Supplemental Material [37]).\n056802-3\neigenstates with a node at j \u00bc 0 and only a small overlap with j \u00bc 1. We now analyze the conductance peak at \u03f5 \u00bc 0 in more detail for different lattice sizes. The eigenstate in the middle of the spectrum is symmetric for even and antisymmetric for odd l. The conductance at \u03f5 \u00bc \u03b31 \u00bc 0 is\nG\u00f0\u03b5 \u00bc 0\u00de \u00bc 1 2\u03c0 4\u0393 \u03b30 \u00fe 4\u0393 l \u00bc 0; 2; 4; \u00f08\u00de\nG\u00f0\u03b5 \u00bc 0\u00de \u00bc 1 2\u03c0\n4\u03c42\n\u03b30\u0393\u00fe 4\u03c42 l \u00bc 1; 3: \u00f09\u00de\nThe corresponding expressions are given in the Supplemental Material [37] for \u03b31 > 0. Equations (8) and (9) can be expanded at small \u03b30 as\n4\u0393 \u03b30 \u00fe 4\u0393 \u2248 1 \u2212 \u03c4 4\u0393 \u03b30 \u03c4 ;\n4\u03c42\n\u03b30\u0393\u00fe 4\u03c42 \u2248 1 \u2212 \u0393 4\u03c4 \u03b30 \u03c4 : \u00f010\u00de\nWhen \u0393 \u226a \u03c4, the slope \u03c4=\u00f04\u0393\u00de is large compared to \u0393=\u00f04\u03c4\u00de, resulting in a larger reduction of the conductance with \u03b30 for symmetric eigenstates [see Fig. 2(e)]. We relate the reduction for antisymmetric eigenstates to a symmetry breaking: the coupling to the reservoirs breaks the reflection symmetry around the lossy site, and the wave function gains a finite value there. When the loss extends to the neighboring sites, the wave function at those sites also plays a role. The antisymmetric eigenstates have a finite overlap with j \u00bc 1, leading to a faster decay compared to \u03b31 \u00bc 0. The symmetric eigenstates, in contrast, have a node at j \u00bc 1. This leads to a nonmonotonic behavior: After an initial decay, the conductance is enhanced by the dissipation and even exceeds the value for a strictly local loss. In the \u03b30 \u2192 \u221e limit, it again decreases as \u223c1=\u03b30. When the coupling \u03c41 is finite, the particle loss leads to a reduction of conductance and nonballistic transport. To further understand how the ballistic transport is altered, we analyze the steady-state particle density distribution, shown in Fig. 3 for a lattice of 51 sites. We set \u03b31 \u00bc 0, since the results are essentially the same for the extended loss. We focus on the interplay of the finite voltage and loss, but for completeness, Fig. 3(a) shows the zero-voltage case. The setup in Refs. [18\u201320] is similar, except in our analysis, the coupling to the reservoirs is explicitly described. The loss leads to a density minimum at the lossy site, while the density is nearly uniform in the surrounding lattice. This background density has a nonmonotonic dependence on \u03b30 associated with the quantum Zeno effect [18,19]. When a voltage is present, but there is no loss, the density distribution is approximately uniform apart from Friedel oscillations [cf. Fig. 3(b), \u03b30 \u00bc 0]. Transport through the chain is ballistic and a voltage drop occurs only at the contacts. The situation changes drastically when particle losses are present. The average density becomes\nhigher on the left side of the lossy site and lower on the right. The average density imbalance\n\u03b4n \u00bc 2 L \u2212 1\nX\nj<0\nhnji \u2212 X\nj>0\nhnji\n\u00f011\u00de\nis shown as a function of voltage in Fig. 3(c). It rises approximately linearly for small V and saturates when the voltage exceeds the bandwidth 4\u03c4, as there are no eigenstates which could be filled by chemical potentials outside the lattice energy band. The slope and saturation value of \u03b4n\u00f0V\u00de depend strongly on the dissipation strength. For small \u03b30, hardly any imbalance develops, and transport through the chain is almost ballistic. In contrast, for large \u03b30, a large imbalance arises, reaching the maximum value 1 for \u03b30 \u2192 \u221e and V > 4\u03c4. In the presence of the loss, transport is thus no longer perfectly ballistic. This agrees with the reduction of conductance for increasing loss. For \u03b30 \u2192 \u221e, the lossy site is almost completely emptied, effectively cutting the chain in two. The average density on either side approaches that of a chain of half the length, coupled to a single reservoir with the chemical potential \u03bcL=R at equilibrium. Figure 3(c) shows that the average imbalance for \u03b30 \u00bc 500 indeed overlaps with the result for the half chain. Furthermore, the slope of \u03b4n\u00f0V\u00de can be estimated from the particle density in the reservoir coupled to each half, hnL;Rres i, by equating the chemical potential V=2 with the energy \u03f5kF \u00bc \u22122\u03c4 cos\u00f0kF\u00de\u2014the lattice dispersion relation\u2014where kF \u00bc \u03c0hnresi. The filling factor is then given by\n056802-4\nhnL;Rres i \u00bc 1 \u03c0 arccos \u2213 V 4\u03c4 : \u00f012\u00de\nThe resulting difference hnLresi \u2212 hnRresi agrees very well with the result for \u03b30 \u00bc 500 and the one for a half chain. We further observe that, at large \u03b30, the average densities develop a steplike substructure. These discrete changes in density result from adding (on the left) or removing (on the right) particles one by one when the chemical potential of the reservoirs changes. Indeed, for 25 sites on either side, a change from half to full filling on the left and to an empty lattice on the right corresponds to 12.5 particles, which equals the number of steps in Fig. 3(c). For larger lattices, these steps become more frequent, suggesting that the density approaches the smooth function (12) in theM \u2192 \u221e limit. In summary, we show that particle transport can be very differently affected by a local loss, depending on the underlying symmetry of the eigenstate responsible for the transport. In particular, conductance can remain nearly perfect despite the loss. In the nonlinear-response regime with a finite voltage, we find novel dissipative steady states characterized by a density drop at the lossy site. These phenomena could be observed in cold-atom experiments, where local particle losses have already been explored. Extending the analysis to bosonic [9] or interacting systems is an exciting outlook. An interesting question is what kind of transport properties and nonequilibrium steady states arise in the presence of losses when the system is, for example, in a correlated insulator [38] or superfluid [39] state, or when a local loss leads to long-range coherence [40]. Our analysis focuses on steady-state behavior, and an important question is how, and on what timescale, the steady state is reached. This long-time evolution is not easily accessed by our current approach and is a considerable challenge for future research. However, dissipative steady states have been realized in experiments with local losses [8,15], and we therefore expect that the properties of the steady states studied here could be observed on experimentally relevant timescales.\nWe thank C.
