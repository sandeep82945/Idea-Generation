Mechanisms of Lactic Acidosis-Induced Metabolic Reprogramming: Investigate the detailed molecular mechanisms through which lactic acidosis influences the metabolic shift from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation in cancer cells. This research could focus on identifying key regulatory genes and proteins involved in this metabolic transition and how their modulation affects cancer cell survival and proliferation under glucose deprivation.

Role of Lactic Acidosis in Tumor Heterogeneity and Progression: Explore how lactic acidosis contributes to intratumoral metabolic heterogeneity and the development of aggressive cancer phenotypes. Studies could examine the spatial and temporal dynamics of lactic acidosis within tumors, how it influences the metabolic symbiosis between different tumor cell populations, and its effects on tumor growth, metastasis, and resistance to therapies.

Development of Targeted Therapies Against Lactic Acidosis Pathways: Design and test new therapeutic strategies that target the metabolic adaptations induced by lactic acidosis. This could include developing inhibitors against specific enzymes or transporters involved in lactate metabolism, as well as strategies to modulate the extracellular pH in tumors to disrupt the favorable conditions lactic acidosis creates for cancer cells.

Lactic Acidosis and Immune Evasion: Investigate the impact of lactic acidosis on the immune microenvironment of tumors. Research could focus on understanding how lactic acidosis affects the recruitment, differentiation, and function of immune cells in the tumor microenvironment and the potential for leveraging this knowledge to enhance immunotherapy responses.

Integration of Lactic Acidosis Effects into Systemic Cancer Metabolism Models: Develop comprehensive computational models that integrate the effects of lactic acidosis on cancer cell metabolism with systemic metabolic processes. These models could help in understanding the complex interactions between tumor metabolism and whole-body metabolism, including the influence of diet, microbiome, and other factors on tumor progression and response to therapy.
