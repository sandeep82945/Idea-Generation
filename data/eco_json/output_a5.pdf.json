    "abstractText": "Business research is facing the challenge of scattered knowledge, particularly in the realm of brand loyalty (BL). Although literature reviews on BL exist, they predominantly concentrate on the present state, neglecting future trends. Therefore, a comprehensive review is imperative to ascertain emerging trends in BL This study employs a bibliometric approach, analyzing 1,468 papers from the Scopus database. Various tools including R software, VOS viewer software, and Publish or Perish are utilized. The aim is to portray the knowledge map, explore the publication years, identify the top authors and their co-occurrence, reliable documents, institutions, subjects, research hotspots, and pioneering countries and universities in the study of BL. The qualitative section of this research identifies gaps and emerging trends in BL through Word Cloud charts, word growth analysis, and a review of highly cited articles from the past four years. Results showed that highly cited articles mention topics such as brand love, consumer-brand identification, and social networks and the U.S. had the most productions in this field. Besides, most citations were related to Keller with 1,173 citations. Furthermore, in the qualitative section, social networks and brand experiences were found to be of interest to researchers in the field. Finally, by introducing the antecedents and consequences of BL, the gaps and emerging trends in BL were identified, so as to present the direction of future research in this area.",

Although literature reviews on BL exist, they predominantly concentrate on the present state, neglecting future trends. Therefore, a comprehensive review is imperative to ascertain emerging trends in BL This study employs a bibliometric approach, analyzing 1,468 papers from the Scopus database. Various tools including R software, VOS viewer software, and Publish or Perish are utilized. The aim is to portray the knowledge map, explore the publication years, identify the top authors and their co-occurrence, reliable documents, institutions, subjects, research hotspots, and pioneering countries and universities in the study of BL. The qualitative section of this research identifies gaps and emerging trends in BL through Word Cloud charts, word growth analysis, and a review of highly cited articles from the past four years. Results showed that highly cited articles mention topics such as brand love, consumer-brand identification, and social networks and the U.S. had the most productions in this field. Besides, most citations were related to Keller with 1,173 citations. Furthermore, in the qualitative section, social networks and brand experiences were found to be of interest to researchers in the field. Finally, by introducing the antecedents and consequences of BL, the gaps and emerging trends in BL were identified, so as to present the direction of future research in this area.\nKeywords: Brand Loyalty, Bibliometric Analysis, Content Analysis, Performance Analysis, Map Analysis, Content Analysis, Scopus."

            "heading": "Introduction",
            "text": "The domain of consumer behavior has garnered considerable attention in marketing, with a plethora of studies conducted in this area (Cohen et al., 2014; Jahanshahi et al., 2020). This is due to the recognition that theoretical insights into consumer behavior are instrumental in developing effective marketing strategies (Abrudan, et al., 2020). The nexus between consumer behavior and brands is salient in extant literature (Batra, 2019). In the context of marketing, brands serve as instruments to distinguish products by endowing them with value. In contemporary marketing research, branding has gained prominence as a crucial mechanism for marketers to distinguish themselves from their counterparts by honing their branding skills. Additionally, according to (Singh, 2004), marketers play a pivotal role in shaping a company's marketing strategy. Despite being overlooked in business plans for an extended period, branding has recently attracted the attention of marketers as a means to foster BL (Fournier and Yao, 1997). While it is highly important to create brand attachment in brand management, many companies have considered it in their strategies and are in the process of formulating strategies pursuing this goal (Bairrada and Lizanets, 2019). As consumers face a large number of brands that can expand the range of their choices, it is important for a company to be able to create and maintain BL for itself (Rizomyliotis et al., 2021; Nawaser et al., 2014; Dehkordy et al., 2013) such customers loyal to the brand are then valuable for enterprises (Chang, 2021). On the other hand, BL contributes to the steady growth of a business by increasing market share and profitability, and maintaining loyal customers is necessary for business sustainability (Ramachandran and Balasubramanian 2020). BL is also the key to success in business (Kim et al., 2021) as well as a main component of brand equity that is a competitive advantage because it seeks to develop long-term relationships with customers. BL is defined by both a customer's preference for a brand over other brands, and the customer's commitment to repurchasing the brand (Salem and Salem, 2021). According to Ramachandran (2015). BL is the proportion of each family's purchase of a brand (Tee, Gharleghi, Chan, 2013).\nExamining the research conducted over the last three decades on BL structure, it can then be stated that it (BL) has two dimensions: behavioral and attitudinal loyalty. The former is related to the purchase quantity and to the number of times customers buy the brand and repeat their purchase; the latter includes some concepts such as intention to purchase and intention to recommend to others, which are both functions of customer's psychological commitment to the brand (Nam et al., 2011). In some studies, a combination of these two dimensions is considered, including both behavioral and attitudinal factors with a comprehensive view of this structure (Rather, 2018). BL dates back to more than 70 years ago, a concept that has been debated in marketing over the last few decades (Fournier and Yao, 1997; Nawaser et al., 2015; Jin and Koh 1999). BL was first introduced into the marketing literature in 1952 by Brown and became a hot topic in this respect, regarded also fanatical because it mostly dealt with branded goods (Zhou et al., 2021; Tee, et al, 2015).\nBy collecting knowledge in a domain and showing the current status of a discipline, literature review accordingly plays an essential role in research (Linnenluecke et al., 2020). Therefore, examining review studies in BL, the researcher found three lines of investigation in this regard: (i) a meta-analysis study by Wu and Anridho 2016, which sought to identify the effective factors and mediators of BL; (ii) a review study by Palumbo and Herbig (2000) investigated the concept\nof BL; and (iii) a meta-analysis study on this structure in the hotel industry (G\u00f3rska-Warsewicz and Kulykovets, 2020). A meta-analysis investigation examining the relationship between BL and social network marketing activities can also be mentioned (Ibrahim, 2022). Although we can extract practical knowledge from these reviews, it should be noted that there has been no analysis depicting the future state of this structure.\nToday, there is a growing knowledge production in business research, which is scattered given its huge volume (Snyder, 2019b). Survey of published works concerning BL structure (Figure 1) indicates the high number of studies in this regard, leading to knowledge accumulation; therefore, bibliography is one of the most important tools for evaluating and analyzing the output from a large number of studies in BL to appraise their quality (Cobo et al., 2015; Moezzi et al., 2012; Jahanshahi et al., 2019). Nowadays, many fields of research have reached maturity; therefore, there is growing interest to comprehensively examine different domains using advanced softwares (Koseoglu et al., 2016). In recent years, research on business strategy, finance, human resources, management, and marketing indicate the growth of bibliometric analysis, which is used to discover trends in the performance of journal authors, and in general, to determine the thinking direction in one area because of aiming at identifying the emerging trends in each domain (Donthu et al., 2021; Samadi, et al, 2015).\nThe current study adopted a bibliometric approach in BL to discover the trends, performance, and intellectual structure in this domain, and to draw a clear roadmap for researchers and for future research on BL. Therefore, the following goals are being sought here:\n1. Examining functional components such as author, journal, country, and university in BL domain to identify valid documents and the leading countries and universities in this regard;\n2. Sketching scientific roadmaps to determine the intellectual structure in BL;\n3. Identifying the direction of future research in BL.\nThe present research is organized as follows. In the second section, the research method and its mechanism are described. In the third section, based on research objectives, results in performance, network, and content areas are described. In the fourth section, the obtained results are discussed. Finally in the fifth section, research limitations along with suggestions for future research are discussed."

            "heading": "Methodology",
            "text": "Literature review espouses a scientific method and seeks to present a complete report in a specific area (Green, 2017). It can be observed that literature review has moved from a traditional analysis toward a systematic one over time, examines past research, and not just intending to review them, but also trying to extract appropriate answers from studies by analyzing and combining data (M\u00e1rcio et al., 2016). Nowadays, concomitant with the increase of scientific productions in different domains, it is necessary to deploy an appropriate method to integrate the high volume of these scientific productions in different domains and specify the connection between them. The bibliometric approach, which has a long history in science, can use a large volume of data from past studies and classify them based on a number of indicators to\ndraw a perspective of the relevant field for researchers. These bibliometric studies are useful to describe, evaluate, and monitor the published research (Wallin, 2005; Zupic & \u010cater, 2014). This feature of bibliometric differentiates it from other review studies (Fahim, Faryal, 2022) because due to the diversity of data, this approach does not have individual bias like other review studies (Gurzki & Woisetschl\u00e4ger, 2017). Moreover, data collection and analysis in bibliometrics allows for prediction of the future of a specific domain through discovering the hidden patterns of each area (Hashemi et al., 2022). Bibliography has become highly popular in business research nowadays, which can manage a large volume of citation data and illustrates them in the form of meaningful patterns for researchers. The softwares used in this approach are compatible with citation databases such as Scopus and WOS (web of science) to extract citation data (Mukherjee et al., 2022).\nIn this research, a positivist paradigm with a quantitative approach has been applied according to the systematic review of the existing literature. To follow the existing analogy in quantitative approach, the researcher pursued a specific process called research plan or strategy. In a step-bystep process, this strategy shows the path and the method to achieve the goals (Barad, 2017) so that one can reach the best results in terms of research goals from the large amount of data. The researchers thus proceed with research according to the steps of the following diagram.\nDiagram 1. Methodological process of bibliometric studies (Moradi and Miralmasi, 2020:570).\nThis study aims to review the literature on BL and its current and future state using bibliometric techniques. The authors use four steps to conduct their analysis: (i) choosing the problem and the domain of BL and its importance for firms and consumers; (ii) setting goals to examine the performance and citation network of BL research; (iii) specifying the search strategy to select 1,468 documents from Scopus database using the keyword \"BL\"; and (iv) choosing Publish and Perish, R (biblioshiny) and VOSviewer software to search for relevant documents, perform performance, content, co-citation, co-authorship, and co-word analysis.\nResults and Discussion\nAccording to the proposed step-by-step process in diagram (1), after data extraction and mining, the researchers examined the results of bibliometric analysis in the sixth step. In general, there are two methods for bibliometric citation data analysis: performance analysis and scientific mapping. In performance analysis, a number of indices are reviewed in order to label the prevailing conditions in the respective area, which can also be considered as descriptive; in scientific mapping as a kind of network analysis, interactions and connections between citations data in that domain are investigated (Donthu et al., 2021). Finally, the researcher performs content analysis by studying the keywords in the forms of WordCloud and word growth diagram in order to introduce gaps and areas for future research."

A total of 168 authors were estimated for participation. In this figure, each node represents an author, and the size of nodes is determined by the number of articles published by the author. Eight clusters have accordingly been created showing that there are collaborations between eight research teams in these domains, and that the red cluster and its subsets (Chuba, Kim W, Lee S, Song H) have the most significant collaboration followed by Hwang's green cluster and its subsets (Choe, Kim, and Ki). This figure also shows that the collaborations are scattered and perhaps we see only two authors in these clusters. Due to large distances geographically, the authors seem not to work closely together in this field.\nFigure 6 shows the collaboration network of countries that produce articles on BL.

            "text": "The present research was conducted for providing a systematic overview of BL to present its history and future prospective. Using advanced bibliometric techniques, the researchers created a database of main complementary studies based on Scopus. By applying filters, 1,468 documents were accordingly made available to the researchers. They examined a number of performance components such as author, publication, country, and university. After plotting scientific maps, the researchers specified the roadmap for future studies to determine intellectual structure in BL. The trend of publications on BL was first reviewed and it was then found that this domain continues to grow, being of interest to researchers. Influential articles in BL with highest number of citations were then identified, being addressed in highly cited articles on brand love, brand special value, and social media. Bagizi and Wang were also found influential authors. The publications related to this domain based on total number of citations and h-index were assessed. It was found that the Journal of Business Research received the most citations with a high hindex in BL. In the following, the most effective organizations and countries within this domain are introduced. Results showed that USA had both the most production and citations followed by Asian countries with high production in BL, indicating that it is highly considered by researchers in Asia so that in the review of institutions, South Korean and Australian universities had larger numbers of productions.\nIn network analysis and scientific maps section, the co-word map with four clusters was plotted. The most frequent words were then \"BL\", \"brand value\", and \"brand trust\". Collaboration between authors showed that the cooperation of countries producing articles within the field of BL was steady between authors from USA and South Korea. These two countries have remarkable impacts on this field, while there is scattered collaboration between authors in this domain. The co-authorship network also showed that Keller, Hair, and Aaker had the highest cocitation in BL domain, respectively. In the meantime, the highest number of citations in BL articles was related to works by Keller with 1,173 citations. Finally, by analyzing keywords in BL in both forms of WordCloud and word growth, it was found that social media and brand experience are of interest for researchers in this domain, being observed in both WordClouds. Therefore, further growth of articles in BL centered on social media will be observed in coming years. Review of keywords also showed that there has been no work in this domain related to COVID-19 pandemic. Analyzing highly cited articles over the last four years (mostly addressing\ntourism and hoteling industries) using covariance-based software indicated that their methodologies were quantitative. Influential factors and the most frequent outcomes of BL were also recognized in these articles. The paper contributed to the literature by providing a comprehensive and updated overview of BL research, and by highlighting the opportunities and challenges for future studies.\nLimitations and suggestions for future research\nReferring to only one single scientific database, and using English-only articles could be viewed as limitations of the present work. Future research is therefore suggested to use papers written in other languages related to BL as well as other sources like books and conference papers. Nevertheless, the researchers attempted to make a precise analysis of scientific documents through comprehensive review of BL so that their findings could be beneficial for stakeholders and research communities as a primary reference for gaining insight into BL. It is suggested that further studies should explore the impact of social media and brand experience on BL, as well as the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on BL in different industries."
