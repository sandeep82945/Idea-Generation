Oxidation of 1 with [Fc][BArF] (BArF = B(C6F5)4) yielded [(Trip2Sb)(TripSb)Naph][BArF] (3) containing the stibane-coordinated stibenium cation [(Trip2Sb)(TripSb)Naph] +. Subsequent reduction of 3\nwith KC8 yielded distibane (TripSb)2Naph (4). 1\u20134 were characterised by NMR (1H, 13C) and IR spectroscopy as well as single-\ncrystal X-ray diffraction (sc-XRD), while their electronic structures\nwere analysed by quantum chemical computations.\nThe utilisation of donor\u2013acceptor bonding in chemical synthesis has received increasing interest since the development of frustrated Lewis acid\u2013base pairs (FLPs) by Stephan et al. almost 15 years ago.1\nFLPs are ambiphilic species due to the presence of both a Lewis basic and a Lewis acidic center, which were used in bond activation reactions and organic transformations.2 FLPs are mainly based on N/B, P/B, P/Al combinations, but related systems have also been reported,3 including P-coordinated tetrylenes4 and peri-substituted naphthalene complexes with P-E and EB (E = Sn, Pb) interactions.5\nIn contrast, comparable complexes containing heavy pnictogen atoms are rare.\nNeutral donor\u2013acceptor complexes R3Pn\u2013Pn0R03 of Lewis basic phosphanes PR3 (R = alkyl, aryl) and Lewis acidic phosphanes PX3 (X = halide)\n6 as well as their heavier homologues are well known.7\u20139 Since donor\u2013acceptor interaction strengths typically decrease with increasing atomic number, neutral complexes of heavy pnictogens tend to dissociate to either the\nneutral Lewis acid and Lewis base or with formation of ionic species [R3Pn\u2013Pn0R02]\n+[R0] (Fig. 1), which are often more stable toward Pn\u2013Pn0 bond dissociation due to the increased Lewis acidity of the pnictenium (Pn0R02\n+) cation.8\u201311 peri-Substituted naphthalene and acenaphthene complexes, in which the pnictogen atoms are fixed in 1,8-position, are also promising candidates to study Pn(III)\u2013Pn(III) donor\u2013acceptor interactions since they can not separate into two individual species. While complexes of this type containing lighter pnictogens are known,12 those of the heaviest elements of group 15, Sb and Bi, are still rare, and they exclusively contain rather strong phosphane donors.13\nWe recently reported on dipnictanes Pn2Naph2 (Pn = As, Sb, Bi)14 and bis(diphenylpnicta)naphthalenes (Ph2Pn)2Naph (Pn = Sb, Bi)15 of the heaviest group 15 elements. Due to our general interest in pnictogen-centered radicals,16 we investigated single electron transfer reactions of the latter. Unfortunately, reactions with several oxidants failed to give defined reaction products. We therefore replaced the Ph groups by bulky Trip groups (Trip = 2,4,6-i-Pr3C6H2), which successfully stabilised Trip3Pn + radical cations,17 in order to kinetically stabilise\na Institute of Inorganic Chemistry, University of Duisburg-Essen, 45117 Essen,\nGermany.

(Trip2Pn)2Naph (Pn = Sb 1, Bi 2) were synthesized by reaction of Trip2PnCl (Pn = Sb, Bi) with Li2Naph at 78 1C (1) and 30 1C (2), respectively (Scheme 1).\nThe 1H NMR spectrum of 2 at ambient temperature shows the expected number of signals due to the Naph and Trip substituents, indicating a symmetric molecule in solution, whereas that of 1 exhibits several signals of the Trip groups, pointing to a molecule of lower symmetry. Variable temperature (VT) NMR studies showed that the septet of the ortho i-Pr group first splits into two broad signals, which further split into two septets. DGa values of 15.6 and 15.9 kcal mol 1 were calculated from the coalescence temperatures (50 1C, 70 1C).18 2 also shows coalescence points (0 1C, DGa = 12.9 kcal mol 1; 60 1C, DGa = 13.3 kcal mol 1) at lower temperatures. The hindered rotation most likely stems from ligand\u2013ligand interactions of the large Trip groups, which are expected to be larger in 1 due to the smaller Sb atoms compared to the Bi atoms in 2, resulting in larger rotational barriers in 1.\nSingle crystals of 1 (Fig. 2A) and 2 (Fig. S26, ESI\u2020) were grown from saturated solutions in ethanol upon storage at +4 1C. 1 and 2 crystallise in the orthorhombic and monoclinic space groups P21212 (1) and C2/c (2) with two (1) and four (2) molecules per unit cell, respectively. Selected bond lengths and angles are given in Table 1.\nThe pnictogen atoms adopt trigonal-pyramidal coordination spheres, and the sum of bond angles (306.021 1, 296.561 2) indicate a high p-orbital character of the bonding electrons. The Sb\u2013C (2.1769(11) \u00c5, 2.2019(11) \u00c5, 2.1902(10) \u00c5) and Bi\u2013C (2.318(4) \u00c5, 2.326(5) \u00c5, 2.326(5) \u00c5) bonds are rather long due to the large steric crowding in 1 and 2. Despite the increased steric hindrance, the Sb Sb distance in 1 (3.2327(2) \u00c5) is shorter than that in (Ph2Sb)2Naph (3.2983(6) \u00c5),\n15 indicating stronger attractive forces, i.e. ligand ligand dispersion interactions of the i-Pr groups of the Trip substituents. In marked contrast, the Bi Bi distance in 2 (3.6742(4) \u00c5) is significantly elongated compared to that in (Ph2Bi)2Naph (3.4461(4) \u00c5).15 The elongation of the Pn Pn distance in 2 compared to 1 points to stronger repulsive interactions between the Bi atoms, which is also reflected by the larger distortion of the Naph ligand in 2 (dihedral angles: 12.78(7)1 1, 28.13(29)1 2). In addition, intramolecular CH p contacts are found for 1 and 2 (Fig. S29, ESI\u2020).\nWe performed cyclic voltammetry (CV) studies with 1 and 2 to study their redox properties (Fig. S21\u2013S24, ESI\u2020). Two oxidation events were observed for 1, with a pseudo-reversible first one (E1/2(Fc\n0/+1) = 0.1 V) as indicated by the peak-to-peak distance DEp value, which increased significantly with faster scan rates, followed by an irreversible second event (Ep,a(Fc\n0/+1) = 0.74 V). In contrast, only one irreversible oxidation event was observed for 2 (Ep,a(Fc\n0/+1) = 0.66 V), which occurred at a slightly lower voltage than the irreversible event of 1. The reduction event found at Ep,c = 0.79 V was observed only when the sample was scanned in the oxidative direction. The CV studies indicate that 1 can be oxidised by a mild oxidant, and 1 was therefore reacted with [Fc][BArF].19 The reaction immediately resulted in a color change (Scheme 2), and green crystals were isolated after workup, which did not show any paramagnetic behaviour. They were identified as [(Trip2Sb)(TripSb)Naph] [BArF] (3) and TripH was formed as a by-product. Analogous reactions in thf or CH2Cl2, which are easier to deprotonate than benzene, proceeded much faster, hence we assume that the Trip anion is protonated by the solvent. The splitted signals for the Naph protons in the 1H NMR spectrum of 3 indicate an unsymmetric species. In addition, both sharp and broad signals in a 2 : 1 ratio are observed for the Trip protons. VT 1H NMR studies showed a coalescence temperature of 70 1C for the sharp signals. The calculated rotational barrier (DGa = 10.1 kcal mol 1) is roughly 5 kcal mol 1 smaller than that in 1, which is in line with the reduced steric hindrance due to removal of one Trip ligand. Comparable oxidation reactions were performed with 2. Due to the higher oxidation potential, [NO][SbF6] was chosen as the oxidant. The resulting reaction mixture showed high activity toward the polymerization of thf, but unfortunately, any attempts to isolate a product failed.\nTo transfer cation 3 into a radical species, we attempted a reduction with KC8. A yellow solid was isolated after work-up and identified as (TripSb)2Naph (4) (Scheme 2), while TripH and K[BArF] formed as by-products. The 1H NMR spectrum of 4 shows the expected signals for a highly symmetric species.\nSingle crystals of 3 (Fig. 2B) and 4 (Fig. 2C) were grown from saturated solutions in 2 mL of CH2Cl2 layered with 30 mL of\nScheme 1 Synthesis of sterically crowded bispnictanaphthalenes 1 and 2.\nFig. 2 Solid-state structures of 1 (A), 3 (B), and 4 (C) with displacement ellipsoids drawn at the 50% probability level.

The Sb\u2013C bonds in 3 and 4 are shorter than those in 1 as was expected, but the tetrahedrallycoordinated Sb1_1 atom in 3 (2.1170(5), 2.1367(15), 2.1465(15) \u00c5) surprisingly shows slightly shorter Sb\u2013C bonds than the three-coordinated Sb2_1 centers in 3 (2.1647(17), 2.1708(16) \u00c5) and 4 (2.149(6), 2.196(6), 2.153(6), 2.192(6) \u00c5), respectively. The Sb\u2013Sb distance in 3 (2.7980(4) \u00c5) is significantly shorter compared to that of 1 (3.2327(2) \u00c5) and in the range of typical Sb(II)\u2013Sb(II) bond lengths, indicating a strong Sb Sb charge-transfer interaction. The Sb Sb distance in 3 is virtually identical to the \u2018\u2018regular\u2019\u2019 Sb\u2013Sb single bond in 4 (2.7991(6) \u00c5), and both are at the shorter end of the Sb\u2013Sb bond length range reported for distibanes.20\nTo interpret these experimental findings, quantum chemical computations were performed both for compounds 1\u20134 and the Ph-substituted reference systems S1\u2013S4 (see Fig. 3 and ESI\u2020). In the latter, the ligands at the Pn centers are not connected, so the Pn Pn interactions can be determined by dividing the systems into two fragments. A comparison of the calculated data confirms that the Sb\u2013Sb bond lengths in 3 (2.806 \u00c5) and in S3 (2.848 \u00c5) are slightly shorter than that in 4 (2.820 \u00c5) and in S4 (2.860 \u00c5), suggesting that the Sb\u2013Sb binding in the cationic donor\u2013acceptor compounds (3, S3) is stronger than in the distibanes (4, S4) containing a \u2018\u2018regular\u2019\u2019 Sb\u2013Sb covalent bond. Indeed, the total binding energy (DE in Fig. 3) obtained from a bond energy analysis calculation is higher for S3 (Fig. 3, 64.2 kcal mol 1) than for S4 ( 46.9 kcal mol 1). A glance at the individual attractive energy terms for the Sb\u2013Sb bonds in S3 and S4 reveals that they are very similar and quite different from the van der Waals interaction of the fragments in S1 (Fig. 3). Thus, the relative sizes of the individual terms are not significantly different; in fact, in S4 the electrostatic term is slightly larger than in S3; in other words, the dative Sb\u2013Sb bond in S3 is stronger than the covalent bond in S4 due to orbital interactions. NBO analysis of S3 and S4 shows that the Sb\u2013Sb bond in S3 is strongly polarised (Fig. 3): the tetravalent Sb atom has a higher fraction (64%) and the s character of the orbital is significantly higher (22%) than that at the trivalent Sb atom (4%). As expected, a symmetric Sb\u2013Sb bond with high p fraction (95%) of the interacting orbitals is found for S4. Quantum theory of atoms in molecules (QTAIM)21 analysis of S3, S4, 3 and 4 confirms these findings (Tables S10\u2013S12 and Fig. S34\u2013 S39, ESI\u2020). The Laplacian of the electron density (r2rCP) at the bond critical points (BCP) between the Sb atoms is in all cases negative which corresponds to polar covalent interactions. Furthermore, the BCPs in S3 and 3 are closer to the tetravalent\nthan to the trivalent Sb atom, indicating a polarised bond. A stabilising effect resulting from ligand\u2013ligand dispersion interactions in 3/S3 relative to 4/S4 is negligible for the strength of the Sb\u2013Sb bond.\nTable 1 Selected bond lengths [\u00c5] and angles [1] of 1\u20134\n1 2 3 4\nPn Pn 3.2327(2) 3.6742(4) 2.7980(4) 2.7991(6) Pn\u2013C 2.1769(11), 2.2019(11),\n2.1902(10) 2.318(4), 2.326(5), 2.326(5) 2.1170(15), 2.1367(15), 2.1465(15), 2.1647(17), 2.1708(17) 2.149(6), 2.196(6), 2.153(6), 2.192(6)\nC\u2013Pn\u2013 Pn 80.89(3), 93.23(3), 167.59(3)\n74.73(11), 102.87(13), 164.20(13)\n91.26(4), 80.51(4), 137.25(4), 98.29(4), 106.31(4)\n86.18(16), 100.81(17), 85.91(15), 102.91(15)\nC\u2013Pn\u2013C 106.84(4), 101.51(4), 97.64(4)\n107.53(16), 96.72(17), 92.31(9)\n113.07(6), 113.33(6), 107.08(6), 102.86(6) 100.7(2), 99.9(2)\nScheme 2 Two-step reduction of 1 with elimination of TripH.\nFig. 3 Calculated (B3LYP-D3BJ/def2-TZVP) Sb Sb distances [\u00c5] in the reference systems S1, S3 and S4.

A very strong donor\u2013acceptor interaction is observed for the stibanecoordinated stibenium cation (3-An), resulting in a short Sb Sb distance that is typical for regular Sb\u2013Sb single bonds. According to quantum chemical calculations, the dative Sb\u2013Sb bond in the related Ph-substituted system S3 is stronger than the covalent Sb\u2013Sb bond in S4 due to orbital interactions.\nFinancial support by the DFG (SCHU1069/19-2) is acknowledged."

Rev., 1996, 96, 877. 20 The Sb\u2013Sb bond length in the complex [(CO)4Cr(Sb2Et4)]2 reported\nby Breunig et al. is significantly below any reported distibane to date. However, the authors present a highly disordered structure and can not exclude the presence of a second species. Therefore, the values should be treated with caution: H. J. Breunig, E. Lork, O.
