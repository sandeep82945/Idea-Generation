    "abstractText": "The thriving field of atomic defect engineering towards advanced electrocatalysis relies on the critical role of electric field polarization at the atomic scale. While this is proposed theoretically, the spatial configuration, orientation, and correlationwith specific catalytic properties ofmaterials are yet to be understood. Here, by targeting monolayer MoS2 rich in atomic defects, we pioneer the direct visualization of electric field polarization of such atomic defects by combining advanced electron microscopy with differential phase contrast technology. It is revealed that the asymmetric charge distribution caused by the polarization facilitates the adsorption of H*, which originally activates the atomic defect sites for catalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Then, it has been experimentally proven that atomic-level polarization in electric fields can enhance catalytic HER activity. This work bridges the longexisting gap between the atomic defects and advanced electrocatalysis by directly revealing the angstrom-scale electric field polarization and correlating it with the as-tuned catalytic properties of materials; the methodology proposed here could also inspire future studies focusing on catalytic mechanism understanding and structure-property-performance relationship.",

While this is proposed theoretically, the spatial configuration, orientation, and correlationwith specific catalytic properties ofmaterials are yet to be understood. Here, by targeting monolayer MoS2 rich in atomic defects, we pioneer the direct visualization of electric field polarization of such atomic defects by combining advanced electron microscopy with differential phase contrast technology. It is revealed that the asymmetric charge distribution caused by the polarization facilitates the adsorption of H*, which originally activates the atomic defect sites for catalytic hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Then, it has been experimentally proven that atomic-level polarization in electric fields can enhance catalytic HER activity. This work bridges the longexisting gap between the atomic defects and advanced electrocatalysis by directly revealing the angstrom-scale electric field polarization and correlating it with the as-tuned catalytic properties of materials; the methodology proposed here could also inspire future studies focusing on catalytic mechanism understanding and structure-property-performance relationship.\nThe utilization of renewable energy sources to solve the global fossil fuel crisis necessitates the process of energy conversion and storage1. This process involves interphase reactions and typically requires the presence of electrocatalysis and thus advanced electrocatalysts2\u20135. With the design of such materials delving into nano-, subnano- and atomic-scale strategies nowadays, understanding the atomic-level origins of electrocatalytic properties is crucial for developing efficient and low-cost catalysts. In fact, the essence of the electrocatalytic processes is the charge transfer between reactants and catalysts, which enables the adsorption of reactants and their successive activation/ transformation6. The charge transfer efficiency of electrocatalysts is determined by the intrinsic field/charge distribution surrounding these surface atomic sites. However, such experimental studies have been scarcely reported due to the limit of appropriate characterization that is sensitive to atomic electric field. A large number of advanced electrocatalysts have atomic defect structures on their surfaces. These defects can alter the electric field/ charge distribution of electrocatalysts with enhanced catalytic performances7\u201313. More importantly, introducing atomic defects on the electrocatalyst surface leads to the generation of non-periodic electric fields (eg., polarized electric fields) that can significantly enhance the electric field effect at reaction interfaces, offering a\nReceived: 17 July 2023\nAccepted: 16 November 2023\nCheck for updates\n1College of Chemistry and Materials Engineering, Wenzhou University, Wenzhou, Zhejiang 325035, China. 2School of Physics and Optoelectronics, Xiangtan University, Xiangtan 411105, China. 3Interdisciplinary Research Center for Sustainable Energy Science and Engineering (IRC4SE2), School of Chemical Engineering, Zhengzhou University, Zhengzhou 450001, China. 4Feringa Nobel Prize Scientist Joint Research Centre, School of Chemistry and Molecular Engineering, East China University of Science & Technology, Shanghai 200237, China. 5ShenSi Lab, Shenzhen Institute for Advanced Study, University of ElectronicScience andTechnologyofChina, LonghuaDistrict, Shenzhen518110,China. 6CollegeofChemical andBiological Engineering, ZhejiangUniversity, Hangzhou 310027, China. 7Quzhou Institute of Power Battery andGridEnergy Storage,Quzhou, Zhejiang 324000,China. 8These authors contributed equally: Jie Xu, Xiong-Xiong Xue. e-mail: shaogonglei@zzu.edu.cn; yifeiyuan@wzu.edu.cn; jluo@uestc.edu.cn; junzoelu@zju.edu.cn\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:7849 1\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\n12 34\n56 78\n9 0 () :,;\nviable strategy to tune catalytic reaction kinetics14\u201316. Analyzing the non-periodic electric field on the electrocatalyst with high spatial accuracy is crucial for understanding the catalytic mechanism. Unfortunately, since the technical challenges of atomic imaging currently hinder the characterization of the non-periodic electric fields surrounding specific atomic defects, understanding such microscopic mechanisms largely relies on theoretical calculations14\u201316. This difficulty is leading to the inability to study the structure-performance relationship between the atomic electric fields of most catalysts with defects and catalytic activity.\nElectrocatalytic HER is currently a research focus due to its highenergy density and clean advantages of hydrogen energy that offer an advanced solution for energy sustainability2\u20135. Among the many investigated catalysts, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) stands out not only because of its low cost and high efficiency but also due to its high two-dimensional (2D) structural variability, tuned by atomic defect engineering, to achieve effective property regulation17\u201320. Therefore, MoS2, with point defects as a catalyst, is an ideal material system to explore the effect of electric fieldpolarization of atomic defect sites on the as-tuned catalytic property and performance.\nHerein, we realize controlled preparation of antisite defect structures (two S or single S atoms occupy the position of Mo atoms, denoted as S2Mo-MoS2 or SMo-MoS2) with a concentration of 4 % in monolayer MoS2 base planes by H2/Ar atmosphere-assisted calcination. More importantly, we visualized the distribution of the polarized electric field surrounding the antisite defects by the atomic-resolution differential phase contrast (DPC) technology. Furthermore, combined withmicro-reactor electrochemical testing, the excellent HER catalytic activity of the antisite defects is demonstrated. These results indicate that a polarized electric field significantly enhances catalytic activity.\nThe structure-performance relationship between the electric field polarization of the antisite defects and their as-tuned catalytic performance is well understood."

            "text": "In this work, we first obtained pristine monolayer 2D MoS2 by chemical vapor deposition (CVD)18. As shown in Fig. 1a, the as-prepared MoS2 sample was calcined at 400 \u00b0C in H2/Ar atmosphere (5% H2 concentration) for 1 and 5min, to obtain 2D MoS2 containing Mo vacancies (denoted as VMo-MoS2-1) and antisite defects (denoted as S2Mo-MoS2-5), respectively. Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDS) elemental maps (Supplementary Fig. 1) proved the existence of S and Mo elements, indicating that pristine MoS2 was synthesized. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements show that the thickness of the pristine MoS2 is 0.84 nm (Supplementary Fig. 2), which conforms to the characteristics of monolayer MoS2\n19. Further, the optical images in Fig. 1b-d also show that the three MoS2-based materials all have regular triangle shapes. In addition, Raman and photoluminescence (PL) spectroscopy were used to investigate the spectral feedback information caused by the structural changes in the three MoS2-based materials. The Raman spectra (Supplementary Fig. 3a) show that compared with the pristine MoS2, the broadening of thepeak spreadof VMo-MoS2-1 andS2Mo-MoS2-5 indicates that they have more defect structures18,20. In the PL spectra (Supplementary Fig. 3b), for VMo-MoS2-1 and S2Mo-MoS2-5, the intensities of the main peaks are suppressed and the positions of themain peaks show a red shift, compared to the pristine MoS2. These findings further confirm that there are point defects in VMo-MoS2-1 and S2Mo-MoS2-5\n18,21. Additionally, the Raman and PL spectra show that S2Mo-MoS2-5 has\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:7849 2\nmore defects than VMo-MoS2, which may be due to the longer calcination time of S2Mo-MoS2-5.\nAberration-corrected scanning transmission electronmicroscopy (AC-STEM) was performed to reveal the atomic configurations of the three MoS2-based materials. Firstly, there is no significant damage from the electron beam when collecting high-angle annular dark field (HAADF) images (Supplementary Fig. 4), which proves that the atomic structure of the preparedmonolayer MoS2 was relatively stable. Then, Fig. 1e shows theHAADF-STEM imageof the pristineMoS2, where highand low-contrast atoms correspond to Mo and S, respectively. As shown in Fig. 1f, Mo vacancies (indicated by the yellow circles) were found in VMo-MoS2-1, indicating that the Mo atoms first break away from their original sites to form vacancies during the annealing process. Further, the concentration of the Mo vacancies was calculated to be approximately 2.5 % through the larger-area atomic-resolution HAADF image of VMo-MoS2-1 (Supplementary Fig. 5). TheHAADF-STEM image of S2Mo-MoS2-5 is shown in Fig. 1g, and the antisite defects are represented by the red circles. We can clearly observe that, in each antisite defect, two S atoms occupy a Mo site (S2Mo), where the two S atomsmigrate from the nearby locations to theMo site and leave the S vacancy, as indicatedby the red arrow.Notably, the antisite defect type of a single S atom occupying a Mo site (SMo) has also been found, as indicated by the magenta arrow in Fig. 1g. Accordingly, more data on the HAADF-STEM atomic intensity analysis of the antisite defects are shown in Supplementary Fig. 6. These results further confirm the successful preparation of the antisite defects.\nThen, we explore the effect of the antisite defects concentration under the sameexperimental conditions except fordifferent annealing times. It is worth mentioning that without annealing treatment, one can hardly find antisite defects with extremely low concentrations in the pristine monolayer MoS2 (Fig. 2a), not to mention establishing the qualitative or quantitative relationship between such defects and any resulting catalytic properties. Further, more HAADF-STEM data show\nthat there are no S vacancies around the antisite defects in pristine MoS2 (Supplementary Fig. 7), indicating that foreign S atoms can directly occupy Mo sites to form the antisite defects. This is also consistent with the atomic configuration of the antisite defects reported in the literature22,23. When the annealing time is 3min for pristine MoS2 (denoted as S2Mo-MoS2-3), we also find the existence of Mo vacancies in addition to the antisite defects (Fig. 2b), indicating that Mo vacancies may be the prerequisite for the formation of the antisite defects. Besides, in the S2Mo-MoS2-5 samples, the concentration of the antisite defects is approximately 4.0% (Fig. 2c). Compared with pristine MoS2, we can control the concentration of the antisite defects in S2Mo-MoS2-5 to increase by 44 times, and the concentration of Mo vacancies also increases accordingly (Fig. 2d). As the annealing time increases to 15min (denoted as S2Mo-MoS2-15), antisite defects can still be found; however, more hole structures also appear (Supplementary Fig. 8), indicating that the monolayer MoS2 material has been destroyed.\nIn addition, in the S2Mo-MoS2-5 sample, we also find that different S vacancies may appear around antisite defects (Supplementary\nFig. 9). DFT calculations (Supplementary Fig. 10) further demonstrate that S vacancies could be beneficial for the formation of Mo vacancies and the formation energy gradually decreases with increasing S vacancies. In fact, the formation of Mo vacancies is a critical prerequisite for the generation of the S2Mo defects, which vacate position space for the antisite S atoms. Furthermore, the climbing image nudged elastic band (cNEB) method was performed to understand the underlying growthmechanismof the antisite defects. Considering that there may be multiple growth pathways to form the antisite defects during the annealing process,we compared and analyzed the diffusion barriers of several growth pathways to determine themost likely ones. First, Supplementary Fig. 11a shows the energy profile for the simultaneousmigration of two S atoms directly to occupy aMo vacancy site to form an S2Mo antisite defect. The energy barrier of 3.1 eV indicates\ngrowth mechanism of the antisite defects in S2Mo-MoS2.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:7849 3\nthat this direct formation process is relatively difficult. Figure 2e displays the energyprofile for another step-by-stepgrowthmechanism, in which one S atom first migrates and leaves another S atom in its original position to form an intermediate SMo defect, then the other one further migrates to form the S2Mo defect. The energy barrier for forming the SMo defect is ~1.36 eV, indicating that it is relatively easy to form SMo defects, which has been clearly observed in the experiment shown in Fig. 1g and Supplementary Fig. 6. It is worth noting that compared to Supplementary Fig. 11a, the growth process of forming S2Mo defects from already existing SMo defects has a lower energy barrier of ~2.23 eV, which suggests that such a step-by-step growth pathway is kineticallymore favorable. Therefore, the intermediate SMo antisite defects play a crucial bridging role in the formation of the S2Mo antisite defects. Further, other growthmechanismsof the S2Mo antisite defects have also been reasonably speculated (Supplementary Figs. 11 and 12)."

            "text": "To explore the effect of different electric field distributions in monolayer MoS2 on its catalytic performance, a homemade microelectrochemical HER test device is used to accurately detect the influence of the MoS2 base plane catalytic performance by the defect structure. As shown in Fig. 3a, amicro-electrochemical catalytic device at an exact location on theMoS2 nanosheets base plane is constructed, and it can avoid the interference of numerous external factors and the edge unsaturated active sites18,24. Meanwhile, the window exposed region in the electrochemical device is in close contact with the 0.5M H2SO4 electrolyte, forming an effective and accurate electrochemically active surface area (ECSA)18. The influenceof the number of active sites per unit area on the HER performance of the 2D MoS2 nanosheet can be effectively evaluated by using the ESCA (including the determined number of active sites for all 2D MoS2 samples). Therefore, based on\nECSA of the micro-electrochemical catalytic devices, the polarization curves of each sample (pristine MoS2, VMo-MoS2-1 and S2Mo-MoS2-5) are accurately analyzed in Fig. 3b. At the current density of 10mAcm-2, S2Mo-MoS2-5 with an antisite defect structure exhibits a lower overpotential (169mV) than those of pristine MoS2 (303mV) and VMoMoS2\u22121 (243mV), indicating that the S2Mo-MoS2-5 sample needs a smaller overpotential to drive HER. Meanwhile, the Tafel plots of the three MoS2-based samples were evaluated from the polarization curves in Fig. 3c. S2Mo-MoS2-5 gives the lowest Tafel slope of 56mVdec\u22121 compared to pristine MoS2 and VMo-MoS2-1. Furthermore, multiple S2Mo-MoS2-5 samples were conducted to electrocatalytic HER tests (Supplementary Fig. 13). The results show that the HER performance remained relatively stable, which illustrates the rough homogeneity of the number of antisite defects in S2Mo-MoS2-5 samples. Hence, all these indicators imply that the antisite defect is an excellent catalytically active site for HER.\nThen, DFT calculations were performed to reveal the mechanism of enhanced catalytic activity of the antisite defects. The Gibbs free energy of H* adsorption could be used to evaluate HER catalytic activity by plotting the free energy diagram of \u0394GH*. Figure 3d summarizes the calculated \u0394GH* at different active sites on pristine MoS2, VMo-MoS2, and S2Mo-MoS2. Given the actual existenceof antisite defect structures with different S vacancies in the experiment in Supplementary Fig. 9, we also constructed several vacancy configurations and investigated their catalytic activities. The detailed atomic structures and active sites are shown in Supplementary Fig. 14. The HER freeenergy diagrams in Fig. 3d indicate that the S2Mo-MoS2 structure could optimize the adsorption of H* over a large range and several \u0394GH* values are superior to those of MoS2 and VMo-MoS2, thus greatly improving the HER activity. This result further shows that the optimal reaction centers mainly originate from the antisite defect structures with S vacancies and surrounding S atoms as active sites in\nFig. 3 | HERperformance evaluation andDFT calculation of pristineMoS2, VMoMoS2, and S2Mo-MoS2. a Schematic diagram of a micro-electrochemical device. b Polarization curves and (c) Tafel plots of pristine MoS2, VMo-MoS2, and S2MoMoS2.

By definition, a region with a value of 1.0 denotes ideal charge accumulation, whereas a region with a value near 0.0 signifies a remarkably low charge density.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:7849 4\nSupplementary Fig. 14, demonstrating that the excellent HER catalytic performance of S2Mo-MoS2 depends on the co-existence of various antisite defect structures. Furthermore, the coordination bondingbased analysis is used to elucidate the variations in hydrogen adsorption energies. For pristine MoS2, the nearly saturated bonding state of S atoms makes the adsorption of additional H* difficult (Supplementary Fig. 15a), resulting in weak hydrogen adsorption. For VMoMoS2 in Supplementary Fig. 15b, the introduction of Vmo leads to twocoordinated S atoms with twoMo-S bonds, resulting in an unsaturated property that causes relatively stronger H* adsorption. In SupplementaryFig. 15c, d, unlike in VMo-MoS2, the two-coordinated S atoms in S2Mo-MoS2 structures exhibit more pronounced structural distortions, which will weaken the adsorption of H* compared to the symmetric two-coordinated S atoms in VMo-MoS2. Additionally, for the unique three-coordinated S atomwith twoMo-S bonds and one S\u2013S bond, the weaker S-S bond than the Mo\u2013S bond allows for a greater redundancy of bonding energy to adsorbH* than pristineMoS2, thereby enhancing hydrogen adsorption. In contrast, the additional S\u2013S bond would result in much weaker adsorption compared to two-coordinated S atoms in VMo-MoS2. Overall, the formation of antisite defects breaks the original coordination situation of active S atoms and introduces new coordination environments more favorable for H* adsorption thanpristineMoS2 andVMo-MoS2, thus improving the catalytic activity. Electrical conductivity is another key factor for catalytic activity, and good electrical conductivity can guarantee efficient electron transfer during HER. Figure 3e shows the total and partial density of states (DOS) of pristine MoS2, VMo-MoS2, and S2Mo-MoS2. It can be clearly seen that pristineMoS2 exhibits semiconductor properties with an obvious band gap near the Fermi level. However, the existence of Mo vacancies and the antisite defects introduces electronic states through the Fermi level and induces a semiconductor-to-metallic transition, indicating enhanced electrical conductivity. Further, the integral DOS is calculated by integrating the occupied and unoccupied electronic states around the Fermi level. This result also indicates that S2Mo-MoS2 has a better electrical conductivity (Supplementary Fig. 16). Structural distortion is often accompanied by the redistribution of charge density. As shown in Fig. 3f and Supplementary Fig. 17, pristine MoS2 shows a periodically distributed charge density. However, the\nFig. 4 | DPC characterization results of monolayer S2Mo-MoS2-5. a Imaging mechanism of DPC-STEM. b HAADF-STEM imaging area of S2Mo-MoS2-5 corresponding to the electric field signal collected by the DPC segment detector. c\u2013e Enlarged regions of pristine atomic structure (c), the antisite defect structure (d), andMovacancy structure (e),which correspond to the regions of 1#, 2#, and3#\nin (b). f\u2013h Atomic electric field distribution images corresponding to (c, d).

The red arrows in (g) indicate the electric field polarization region.\nNature Communications | (2023) 14:7849 5\nintroduction of Mo vacancies and the antisite defects leads to local lattice distortions and charge density redistributions, whichwill have a significant effect on catalytic activity. For VMo-MoS2, only the charge of S atoms around Mo vacancies is modulated and exhibits a triple symmetric distribution (Fig. 3g). However, due to the diversity of antisite defect structures, S2Mo-MoS2 exhibits completely different and asymmetric charge density distribution (Fig. 3h, i and Supplementary\nFig. 17). The asymmetric charge density of antisite defect atoms and surrounding S andMoatoms have been effectivelymodulatedwithin a wide range, which activates the activity of these atoms to a greater extent for the adsorption of H* (Fig. 3d), thus improving catalytic efficiency. Therefore, the asymmetric charge density endows S2MoMoS2 with better catalytic performance. Moreover, it has also been previously proven that the asymmetric charge distribution on the catalyst surface can improve catalytic activity25, but the essential polarization has not been proposed. Besides, to elucidate the impact of the antisite defects on the surface potential, this distribution of surface electrostatic potential was computed to more intuitively investigate the influence of antisite defects on the surface electric field potential under experimental conditions (Supplementary Fig. 18). In comparison to the defect-freeMoS2 at a significant separation, there is a significant variation in the potential at defect sites. This observation aligns well with the theoretical proposition that regions with lower electrostatic potential are more prone to electron donation.\nCharacterization of atomic electric field distribution The asymmetric charge density distribution on the catalyst surface is directly related to its electric field, which is the decisive origin of catalytic performances6,11\u201316,26. Here, the DPC technology, a recent advancement in STEM imaging27\u201330, was selected to characterize the electric field distributions of the MoS2-based materials. Figure 4a depicts the imaging mechanism of DPC. When the electron beam is close to an atom, the charge and the resultant electric field of the atom cause the intensity distributions to become asymmetric. The differencebetween the intensities detected by the segments of A andC (orB and D) is the DPC signal, which can be used to obtain the distributions of the electric field according to the established center ofmass (COM)based atomic-resolutionDPCmethodology27\u201330. It shouldbenoted that DPC andCOMhave been successfully used to visualize and analyze the electric fields of graphene defects, single Au atoms, and MoS2\n27,29,31\u201333. Therefore, it is reasonable to use DPC and COM to visualize and analyze the electric fields of atomic defects on the monolayer MoS2 materials. Figure 4b shows the HAADF-STEM image corresponding to the DPC signal acquisition area of S2Mo-MoS2-5 (more data about the DPC signal are provided in Supplementary Fig. 19). The enlarged regions of the pristine structure, an antisite defect, and anMo vacancy are shown in Fig. 4c\u2013e, respectively. The three regions are all from the same sample in Fig. 4b, eliminating the potential impact of different samples or external conditions on DPC results.\nFigure 4f shows the periodic atomic electric field distribution corresponding to the region of the pristine MoS2 structure in Fig. 4c. Further, the electric field distribution corresponding to the atomic structure of the antisite defect in the region of Fig. 4d is shown in Fig. 4g. Notably, we find that the asymmetric electric field distribution of the S atom occupying the Mo site is polarized, and the polarization direction is shown by the red arrow in Fig. 4g, which is significantly different from the electric field distribution of the original Mo atom (data of more polarizations in atomic electric fields are shown in Supplementary Fig. 20). Besides, the simulation image results also show that the electric field distribution of the antisite defect structure has obvious asymmetric polarization (Supplementary Fig. 21). Then, Fig. 4h shows the electricfielddistribution (the yellow circle) of theMo vacancy corresponding to Fig. 4e. The electric field distribution signal at the vacancy is weakened due to the lack of atoms, resulting in\ndisturbances on the electric field distribution of the atoms around the vacancy. In addition, overlay images of HAADF-STEM and the corresponding DPC map in Fig. 4c-h more clearly show the electric field distribution of individual atoms in monolayer MoS2 (Supplementary\nFig. 22). In brief, the electric field distribution of different atomic structures of monolayer MoS2 is well demonstrated by DPC. Further, we obtained a differentiated DPC (dDPC) mapping image of the antisite defect (Supplementary Fig. 23), and the result shows that the charge density distribution of the antisite defect structure was asymmetric, which is also consistent with the DFT calculations. Combining the DPC, dDPC and the DFT calculations results indicate that the polarization in the atomic electric fields of antisite defects directly leads to the appearance of asymmetric charge distributions, enhancing the adsorption of H* and further optimizing the HER catalytic activity."

Next, an ultraviolet lithography machine was used to pattern the electrode pattern. Thermal evaporationwas used to deposit with In/Au (10 nm/50nm) to connect the monolayer 2D samples. The residual photoresist was removed by acetone following a lift-off process, and the metallic electrode was obtained for working electrode devices. In the micro-electrocatalytic process, the photoresist was spin-coated again on the devices in SiO2/Si substrates, and baked at 115 \u00b0C for 90 s. Then, the window exposed region of these 2D samples was opened by a proper ultraviolet beam (the actual surface area of the exposed 2D materials) for HER measurements."

A graphite carbon electrode with a diameter of 1mm tip served as the count electrode, and a homemade saturated Ag/AgCl electrode served as the reference electrode. Each measured monolayer 2D sample with the window-exposed region served as the working electrode. Each electrode isfixedaccuratelywith a hangingbeamarm.TheHERactivity was evaluated in 0.5M H2SO4 electrolyte by linear sweep voltammetry at a scan rate of 5mV s\u22121. The electrolyte volumeon thewindow surface of the 2D material was fixed at 5\u03bcL. All reported potentials were converted to reversible hydrogen electrode (RHE) potentials, and no iR-corrected was used in all the electrochemical measurements."

            "text": "The spin-polarized density functional theory (DFT) calculations are performed by using the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP)38,39. The electronic exchange-correlation energy is described by the Perdew\u2013Burke\u2013Ernzerhof (PBE) functional within the generalized gradient approximation40. The projector augmented wave pseudopotential is usedwith a cutoff energy of 450eV. All atomsare fully relaxed until the force acting on each atom is less than 0.02 eV/\u00c5. For all calculations, a 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 1 supercell is employedwith a vacuum region of 15 \u00c5 to prevent negligible interlayer interactions between the MoS2 and its mirror images. The Brillouin zone is sampled by a 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 1 Monkhorst\u2013Pack scheme k-point mesh. The climbing image nudged elastic band (cNEB) method41 was performed to determine the growth pathway with minimum diffusion barrier for antisite defects. As in the structural optimization above, the same cut-off energies of 450eV, the k-point mesh of 4 \u00d7 4 \u00d7 1, and convergence criteria are used for the supercell with 5 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 1 surface periodicity during the cNEB\ncalculations. Between the stable initial and final states, we inserted three points to determine the optimal growth paths.\nThe formation energy (Ef) of Mo vacancy (VMo) is calculated by:\nEf = EvMo MoS2 EMoS2 +\u03bcMo \u00f02\u00de\nWhere EMoS2 and EVMo MoS2 are the total energies of the MoS2 surface without and with Mo vacancies, respectively. \u03bcMo is the chemical potential of the Mo atom and is calculated from the bulk phase of Mo.\nThe Gibbs free energy of hydrogen adsorption (\u0394GH*) can be calculated by42,43:\n\u0394GH* = \u0394EH* +\u0394EZPE T\u0394S \u00f03\u00de\nwhere \u0394EZPE and \u0394S are the zero-point energy correction and the vibrational entropy change, respectively. \u0394EH* is the hydrogen adsorption energy and is calculated by:\n\u0394EH* = EH* Esurface 1=2EH2 \u00f04\u00de\nwhere EH* and Esurface are the total energies of the surface model with H* adsorption and the clear surfacemodel, respectively. EH2 is the energy of the gas phase H2 molecule.\nAn implicit solvent model was employed. The linearized Poisson \u2212Boltzmann model with a Debye length of 3.0\u00c5 mimics the compensating charge. The electrode potential of the two models to 0.2 V vs SHE was adjusted in accordance with experimental conditions, following the procedure outlined in Equation. The solvent environment was modeled by the VASPsol code44\u201347.\nUq\u00f0V=SHE\u00de= 4:6V \u03a6q=e \u00f05\u00de\nwhere \u22124.6V is the absolute electrode potential of the SHE benchmarked in VASPsol, and \u2212\u03a6q is the work function of the charged system."
