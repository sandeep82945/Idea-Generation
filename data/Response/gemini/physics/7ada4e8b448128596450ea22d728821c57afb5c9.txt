1. **Investigate the effect of different dopant concentrations on the structural, optical, and photocatalytic properties of ZnO nanoparticles.** This could be done by synthesizing ZnO nanoparticles with different Ni dopant concentrations (e.g., 0.5%, 2%, 5%) and characterizing them using XRD, Raman spectroscopy, DRS, PL, and SEM. The photocatalytic activity of the nanoparticles could then be evaluated using MB as a model pollutant. This study would help to determine the optimal dopant concentration for achieving the highest photocatalytic efficiency.


2. **Explore the use of different natural polysaccharides as mediating agents for the synthesis of ZnO nanoparticles.** Cashew gum is just one example of a natural polysaccharide that can be used for this purpose. Other potential polysaccharides include starch, cellulose, and chitosan. By investigating the use of different polysaccharides, it may be possible to identify new materials that can be used to synthesize ZnO nanoparticles with improved properties.


3. **Investigate the photocatalytic activity of ZnO nanoparticles under different light sources.** In this study, the photocatalytic activity of ZnO nanoparticles was evaluated under UV light. However, ZnO nanoparticles can also be activated by visible light or even sunlight. By investigating the photocatalytic activity of ZnO nanoparticles under different light sources, it may be possible to identify new applications for these materials, such as in indoor air purification or water treatment.


4. **Explore the use of ZnO nanoparticles for the photocatalytic degradation of other pollutants.** In this study, the photocatalytic activity of ZnO nanoparticles was evaluated using MB as a model pollutant. However, ZnO nanoparticles can also be used to degrade other pollutants, such as organic dyes, pesticides, and pharmaceuticals. By investigating the photocatalytic activity of ZnO nanoparticles for the degradation of different pollutants, it may be possible to identify new applications for these materials in environmental remediation.


5. **Investigate the long-term stability and reusability of ZnO nanoparticles in photocatalytic applications.** In this study, the reusability of ZnO nanoparticles was evaluated over three cycles. However, it is important to investigate the long-term stability and reusability of ZnO nanoparticles over a longer period of time. This could be done by conducting photocatalytic experiments over multiple cycles and monitoring the activity of the nanoparticles over time. This study would help to determine the practical feasibility of using ZnO nanoparticles for photocatalytic applications.
