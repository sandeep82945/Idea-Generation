The portion of the text mentioning future research directions is not explicitly stated in the provided text. However, the text does discuss the need for comprehensive research regarding raw/unprocessed propolis samples, which could imply a direction for future research. Specifically, it mentions:

"However, despite the extensive research on the biological and chemical aspects of these propolis extracts [19,22,26,30,31], comprehensive research regarding the raw/unprocessed propolis samples is currently missing."

This suggests that future research could focus on exploring the characteristics of unprocessed propolis samples in more detail.
