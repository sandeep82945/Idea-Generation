In this case, from the distribution of the eigenstate generalized fractal dimensions, the chaotic phase becomes more distinguishable from random matrix theory for larger \ud835\udc41 , in a similar way as along trajectories at fixed density.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nQuantum chaos [1] plays a central role in present investigations of complex many-particle dynamics, with systems of trapped ultracold atoms as prominent experimental examples [2\u201314]. Many-particle chaotic dynamical behaviour entails, e.g., fast entanglement generation and quantum information spreading, whose control is a requirement in current experimental quantum simulation platforms [15\u201318]. In the quantum realm, the potential emergence of chaos in a certain parametric regime of the system\u2019s Hamiltonian is ascertained from the comparison of its spectral or eigenvector features against well-known benchmarks dictated by random matrix theory (RMT) [19\u201327]. Furthermore, in a many-particle system, the existence of the chaotic regime is assessed by checking its persistence as the particle number \ud835\udc41 is increased, i.e., in the limit \ud835\udc41 \u2192 \u221e, which also encompasses an infinite dimensional Hilbert space and can be interpreted as a manyparticle semiclassical limit (for large particle density), \u210feff = \ud835\udc41\u22121 \u2192 0 (see, for instance, Ref. [28]). Interacting bosons in a lattice, which are conveniently described by the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian [29\u201332], constitute an archetypical system to study the appearance of quantum chaos [33\u201340] and its dynamical consequences [41\u201348] that is also amenable to treatment with modern semiclassical techniques in the above mentioned limit [49\u201354]. In Refs. [55, 56], we presented a detailed characterization of the chaotic phase of the Bose-Hubbard model at unit particle density, and demonstrated the ability of RMT to capture coarse-grained features of the eigenvector structure in Fock space, as well as the possibility to discriminate the model\u2019s chaotic phase from that of random two-body Hamiltonians. Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, no systematic study of the development of quantum chaos as the limit of infinite Hilbert space dimension is approached along different directions has been carried out. Here, we present a thorough analysis of the dependence of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian\u2019s chaotic phase on particle number, system size, and density. In particular, we investigate\n\u2217 a.buchleitner@physik.uni-freiburg.de \u2020 argon@usal.es\nwhether there is a quantifiable difference between the limits \ud835\udc41 \u2192 \u221e at fixed system size and along trajectories at fixed bosonic density in relation to RMT benchmarks, and whether an optimal route to quantum chaos exists. The manuscript is organized as follows. In Sec. II, we give the particulars of the model and of the tools used to identify the chaotic phase. The influence of particle number, system size and density on the chaotic regime is scrutinized in Sec. III, where we demonstrate the existence of an optimal route towards quantum chaos. The difference between the convergence to eigenstate ergodicity along the limits \ud835\udc41 \u2192 \u221e at fixed system size and at constant density is discussed in Sec. IV, followed by our final remarks in Sec. V."

            "text": "The one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian (BHH) reads [29\u201332]\n\ud835\udc3b = \u2212\ud835\udc3d \ud835\udc3f\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc57=1 ( \ud835\udc4e \u2020 \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc57+1 + \ud835\udc4e\u2020\ud835\udc57+1\ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc57 ) + \ud835\udc48 2 \ud835\udc3f\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc57=1 \ud835\udc4e \u2020 \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc4e \u2020 \ud835\udc57 \ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc57\ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc57 , (1)\nin terms of the standard operators \ud835\udc4e (\u2020) \ud835\udc57 associated with Wannier orbitals localized at each lattice site. The bosonic system is then specified by the total particle number \ud835\udc41 , the number \ud835\udc3f of spatial modes, the nearest-neighbour tunneling energy \ud835\udc3d, and the repulsive two-particle interaction energy\ud835\udc48 > 0. Besides time reversal invariance and particle number conservation, the existence of additional symmetries is determined by the boundary conditions of the lattice. Here, for simplicity, we only consider hard-wall boundary conditions, corresponding to setting \ud835\udc4e (\u2020)\n\ud835\udc3f+1 := 0 in Eq. (1). In this case, \ud835\udc3b exhibits reflection symmetry about the lattice centre ([\ud835\udc3b,\u03a0] = 0where\u03a0 denotes the reflection operation) and Hilbert space can be written as the direct sum\nH = H+ \u2295 H\u2212, (2)\nwithH\u00b1 the symmetric (even parity) and antisymmetric (odd parity) subspace, respectively.\nar X\niv :2\n20 5.\n04 20\n9v 2\n[ qu\nan t-\nph ]\n3 0\nJu n\n20 22\n2 The BHH is integrable in the limit of vanishing tunneling (\ud835\udc3d = 0) as well as in the many-particle non-interacting limit, corresponding to \ud835\udc48 = 0. At those limits, one can find as many independent and commuting conserved observables as underlying degrees of freedom, which are fixed by the number \ud835\udc3f of spatial modes [57]. Integrability hence implies that the eigenstates of \ud835\udc3b are Fock states uniquely identified by \ud835\udc3f quantum numbers. For \ud835\udc3d = 0, for instance, the eigenstates of H\u2212,\n|\ud835\udc8f\u3009 = 1\u221a 2 (1 \u2212 \u03a0) |\ud835\udc5b1, . . . , \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc3f\u3009 , (3)\nare characterized by the eigenvalues of the \ud835\udc3f onsite number operators \ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc57 = \ud835\udc4e\u2020\ud835\udc57\ud835\udc4e \ud835\udc57 . For non-vanishing \ud835\udc3d and \ud835\udc48, the BHH is non-integrable and exhibits a chaotic phase visible in the spectral and eigenvector properties [33, 34, 38, 55\u201357]. The system\u2019s spectral and eigenvector features for varying \ud835\udc41 and \ud835\udc3f can be conveniently compared in terms of the scaled (with respect to the system\u2019s total spectral width) energy\n\ud835\udf00 = (\ud835\udc38 \u2212 \ud835\udc38min)/(\ud835\udc38max \u2212 \ud835\udc38min), (4)\nwhere \ud835\udc38min, \ud835\udc38max denote respectively the lowest and highest eigenenergies of \ud835\udc3b, and the scaled tunneling strength,\n\ud835\udf02 = \ud835\udc3d/\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc41. (5)\nAs we demonstrated in Refs. [55\u201357], the emergence of the chaotic phase at fixed scaled energy \ud835\udf00 is dictated by \ud835\udf02. This can be understood from the behaviour of the spectrum boundaries. While the upper bound of the tunneling term in the Hamiltonian scales as \ud835\udc3d\ud835\udc41 , i.e., linearly with particle number, the maximal interaction energy reads \ud835\udc48\ud835\udc41 (\ud835\udc41 \u2212 1)/2. As a function of \ud835\udc3d/\ud835\udc48, one therefore expects a change from (\ud835\udc38max \u2212 \ud835\udc38min) \u223c \ud835\udc412 to (\ud835\udc38max \u2212 \ud835\udc38min) \u223c \ud835\udc41 for sufficiently high \ud835\udc3d/\ud835\udc48. From the comparison of the spectral widths of the tunneling and interacting terms in Eq. (1), the centre of such crossover may be estimated as \ud835\udf02\u2217 \u2248 (1 \u2212 min(\ud835\udc41, \ud835\udc3f)\u22121)/8. For \ud835\udf02 \ud835\udf02\u2217, the scaled energy is thus equivalent to the energy per particle. For other \ud835\udf02 values, however, approaching the thermodynamic limit at constant \ud835\udf00 requires states whose energy scales quadratically with the particle number, i.e., whose interaction energy does so. For fixed \ud835\udc3d/\ud835\udc48 such system configurations would end up being dominated by the interaction energy and thus in the non-ergodic phase of the system. A reduction of the interaction strength by \ud835\udc41 is then necessary to ensure that both terms in the Hamiltonian scale linearly with particle number, and hence to observe the transition into the chaotic phase. Such rescaling of\ud835\udc48 ensues, for instance, in the semiclassical limit, i.e., for increasing particle density, where the two parameters that govern the system dynamics are \ud835\udc38/\ud835\udc48\ud835\udc412 and \ud835\udf02 [38, 49, 50]. Notwithstanding, for system configurations whose interaction energy scales linearly with \ud835\udc41 as the thermodynamic limit is approached, and hence the energy per particle is fixed, the onset of the chaotic phase should be determined by the bare ratio \ud835\udc3d/\ud835\udc48. The characterization of spectral chaos in the sense of random matrix theory is based on the analysis of short-range features\nof the energy spectrum [1, 20, 22, 23, 25, 26], which is most conveniently carried out in terms of the level spacing ratios \ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5b [58\u201360],\n\ud835\udc5f\ud835\udc5b = min ( \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5b+1 \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5b , \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5b \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5b+1 ) \u2208 [0, 1], (6)\nwhere \ud835\udc60\ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc5b+1 \u2212 \ud835\udc38\ud835\udc5b is the \ud835\udc5bth level spacing. For the Gaussian orthogonal random-matrix ensemble (GOE), the analytic approximation to the distribution of \ud835\udc5f reads [60]\n\ud835\udc43GOE (\ud835\udc5f) = 27 4\n\ud835\udc5f + \ud835\udc5f2\n(1 + \ud835\udc5f + \ud835\udc5f2)5/2 , (7)\nwhich yields the mean level spacing ratio \u3008\ud835\udc5f\u3009GOE = 4 \u2212 2 \u221a 3 \u2248 0.536, in good agreement with \u3008\ud835\udc5f\u3009GOE \u2248 0.5307 obtained from large-scale numerics [60]. In Fig. 1, we unveil the spectrally chaotic phase of the BHH as a function of \ud835\udf00 and \ud835\udf02 from the comparison of the \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc5f) distribution against Eq. (7), quantified by the Kullback-Leibler divergence [61, 62],\n\ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc3f (\ud835\udc43, \ud835\udc43GOE) = \u222b 1 0 \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc5f) ln ( \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc5f) \ud835\udc43GOE (\ud835\udc5f) ) d\ud835\udc5f. (8)\nFor this analysis the energy axis is homogeneously discretized in 100 intervals, and for each \ud835\udf02 the \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc5f) distribution is constructed from the energy levels lying within each interval. The results highlight a tilted and elongated region along the energy axis within which \ud835\udc43(\ud835\udc5f) shows agreement with randommatrix theory, in accord with the description obtained from the comparison of the average value \u3008\ud835\udc5f\u3009 alone [cf. Fig. 3]. (An example of the evolution of \u3008\ud835\udc5f\u3009 versus \ud835\udf02 after averaging over the inner part of the spectrum is shown in Fig. 3 of Ref. [56].) The characteristic flow of the chaotic region\u2019s left boundary from low \ud835\udf00 and low \ud835\udf02 towards higher scaled energy and tunneling strength can be traced back to the trajectory of the maximum of the density of states in this parameter space [56, 57]. The formation of the chaotic phase also bears a specific and notable change in the eigenstates: Spectral chaos unambiguously correlates with the emergence of extended ergodic states in Hilbert space in the thermodynamic limit, as we showed in Refs. [55, 56]. A basic characterization of the eigenstate structure in a chosen basis is provided by the generalized fractal dimensions (GFDs) \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc5e \u2208 [0, 1] [63\u201366], which determine the scaling of the moments of the eigenstate\u2019s distribution of intensities as the Hilbert space size N becomes asymptotically large: \u2211 \ud835\udefc |\ud835\udf13\ud835\udefc |2\ud835\udc5e \u223c N\u2212(\ud835\udc5e\u22121)\ud835\udc37\ud835\udc5e for \ud835\udc5e \u2208 R+, where \ud835\udf13\ud835\udefc are the eigenstate amplitudes in the basis {|\ud835\udefc\u3009} [which here will be given by the states in Eq. (3)]. Whereas vanishing GFDs indicate localization, and non-zero \ud835\udc5e-dependent GFDs signal a multifractal structure (which seems to be ubiquitous in many-body Hilbert spaces [67\u201377]), an extended ergodic eigenstate, i.e., equipartition of the state over all basis elements as N \u2192 \u221e, has associated GFDs \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc5e = 1 for all \ud835\udc5e. We define the finite-size generalized fractal dimensions as\n?\u0303?\ud835\udc5e = \u2212 1 \ud835\udc5e \u2212 1 ln \u2211 \ud835\udefc |\ud835\udf13\ud835\udefc |2\ud835\udc5e lnN , (9)\n3\nwhose asymptotic limits provide the GFDs, \ud835\udc37\ud835\udc5e = limN\u2192\u221e ?\u0303?\ud835\udc5e . We specifically consider\n?\u0303?1 = lim \ud835\udc5e\u21921 ?\u0303?\ud835\udc5e = \u2212 \u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udefc |\ud835\udf13\ud835\udefc |2 ln |\ud835\udf13\ud835\udefc |2 /lnN , (10)\nwhich is determined by the information entropy of the eigenstate. The emergence of the chaotic phase correlates with the occurrence of high ?\u0303?\ud835\udc5e values that approach the ergodic limit for increasingN . Most interestingly, the fluctuation of the finitesize GFDs among near-in-energy eigenstates, characterized by var ( ?\u0303?\ud835\udc5e ) , is an extremely sensitive eigenstate-based probe of quantumchaos (cf. Fig. 3) that further shows a basis independent qualitative behaviour [55\u201357]."

Symbols mark the system configurations used in Figs. 3 (circles), 4(a) (squares), and 4(b) (triangles), lying along curves at constant N , \ud835\udc3f or \ud835\udc41 , respectively, while red straight lines highlight trajectories at fixed filling factor \ud835\udc5b.\nwhere the value of \u0394 depends specifically on the parity of \ud835\udc3f and \ud835\udc41 as given in Table I. The limit of infinite Hilbert space, N \u2192 \u221e, can be reached by increasing \ud835\udc41 or \ud835\udc3f independently, or both simultaneously keeping the filling factor (density)\n\ud835\udc5b = \ud835\udc41\n\ud835\udc3f (12)\nfixed, as illustrated in Fig. 2. While the limit \ud835\udc3f \u2192 \u221e at fixed \ud835\udc41 should intuitively dilute the interaction term in the Hamiltonian, and hence lead to the absence of a chaotic regime, the latter is expected to persist along the path \ud835\udc41 \u2192 \u221e at fixed \ud835\udc3f as well as on trajectories at fixed \ud835\udc5b. Note, however, that the asymptotic growth of Hilbert space along these two paths is markedly different: While the route at constant filling factor witnesses an exponential increase of Fock configurations with particle number, N \u223c [\ud835\udc5b\u22121 (1 + \ud835\udc5b)1+1/\ud835\udc5b]\ud835\udc41 / \u221a \ud835\udc41 , trajectories at constant system size \ud835\udc3f are characterized by the power-law dependence N \u223c \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc3f\u22121. To investigate how quantum chaos in the BHH develops in \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc3f-space, in Fig. 3, we show an overview of the chaotic phase for five configurations with comparable Hilbert space sizes (N ' 5 \u00d7 104, see the blue points in Fig. 2) but with widely varying filling factors, 0.04 6 \ud835\udc5b 6 7.2. The figure shows the\n4 energy and \ud835\udf02 resolved chaotic phase revealed by \u3008\ud835\udc5f\u3009, \u3008?\u0303?1\u3009, and var ( ?\u0303?1 ) . We observe how the spectrally chaotic region, where \u3008\ud835\udc5f\u3009 ' \u3008\ud835\udc5f\u3009GOE, correlates with a marked increase of the fractal dimension, i.e., a delocalization tendency in Hilbert space, and with a very pronounced decrease of its fluctuation among close-in-energy eigenstates [var ( ?\u0303?1 ) drops by 4 orders of magnitude within the chaotic region for \ud835\udc5b = 1]. In terms of \u3008\ud835\udc5f\u3009, the chaotic region seems to be most prominent around \ud835\udc5b = 1 (second-row panels in Fig. 3), whereas it undergoes a visible shrinking as the filling factor is further decreased at constant N , and arguably a subtle narrowing also takes place for \ud835\udc5b = 7.2 (first-row panels). This tendency is also visible in the evolution of var ( ?\u0303?1 ) , which undergoes a very noticeable change. In fact, the disappearance of the chaotic phase for decreasing \ud835\udc5b is earlier witnessed by the variance of the fractal dimension, and the vanishing of its sharp minimum, than by the average \ud835\udc5f statistic (cf. fourth-row panels in Fig. 3). The dissolution of the \u2018chaotic sea\u2019 is also evident from \u3008?\u0303?1\u3009 (middle column in Fig. 3), and as \ud835\udc5b diminishes the values of the fractal dimension in the potentially chaotic region become progressively the same as those in the non-interacting limit (\ud835\udf02 \u2192 \u221e). In the chosen basis, the eigenstates in the noninteracting limit are greatly delocalized (although they are not extended ergodic as N \u2192 \u221e), hence the homogeneously large values of \u3008?\u0303?1\u3009 observed for \ud835\udc5b = 0.04 (bottom row), despite the lack of chaotic fingerprints in \u3008\ud835\udc5f\u3009 and var ( ?\u0303?1 ) .\nThese results indicate that for a given Hilbert space size, the most chaotic configuration occurs around unit filling factor. Let us check whether this picture holds as N is enlarged. In Refs. [55, 56], we demonstrated that the chaotic phase gets increasingly better defined (when comparing against GOE benchmarks) as the thermodynamic limit is approached along trajectories at constant \ud835\udc5b = 1. A sample of the spectral and eigenvector features evolving along trajectories at constant \ud835\udc3f or constant \ud835\udc41 is shown in Fig. 4 (see square and triangular symbols in Fig. 2). As expected, along the trajectory at fixed \ud835\udc3f, the presence of a chaotic regime is enhanced for larger boson number (i.e., larger Hilbert space size), both in terms of the level statistics and in the drop of the variance of ?\u0303?1 [Fig.4(a)]. However, along the trajectory at fixed \ud835\udc41 [Fig.4(b)], no clear indication of the weakening of chaos is observed for the available system sizes: As \ud835\udc3f is increased, the spectrally chaotic region gets better defined, and, although the presence of the chaotic phase in the eigenvector features is rather subtle, the\u2329 ?\u0303?1 \u232a value remains visibly higher than in the non-interacting\nlimit, and the drop of var ( ?\u0303?1 ) slowly develops. Arguably, although one intuitively expects a complete absence of chaos for \ud835\udc3f = \u221e, the evolution along this path is most likely nonmonotonic: Chaos would first emerge as Hilbert space grows and the density of states becomes more continuous, giving rise to a denser spectrum bulk, to eventually fade as \ud835\udc3f becomes large enough. It is nonetheless surprising that for the configuration \ud835\udc41 = 4, \ud835\udc3f = 44 (N = 89 056), there is still no sign of such turning point, and although very slowly, the chaotic phase continues to get sharper. This slow behaviour can be understood by comparing the populations of non-interacting and interacting basis states in H\u2212. The number of states of the form (3) with vanishing\ninteraction energy is non-zero only for \ud835\udc3f > \ud835\udc41 . For simplicity, let us consider the case of even \ud835\udc3f and odd \ud835\udc41 , noting that this assumption does not affect the conclusions obtained below. In this case, the number of non-interacting states reads ( \ud835\udc3f \ud835\udc41 ) /2, and the ratio of non-interacting to interacting configurations is\n\ud835\udc45 = 2N ( \ud835\udc3f \ud835\udc41 )\u22121 \u2212 1  \u22121 , \ud835\udc3f > \ud835\udc41, (13)\nwith N from Eq. (11). The evolution of \ud835\udc45 as a function of \ud835\udc3f and \ud835\udc41 can be seen in Fig. 2. An expansion for large \ud835\udc3f reveals the following behaviour,\n\ud835\udc45 = \ud835\udc3f \ud835\udc41 (\ud835\udc41 \u2212 1) \u2212 1/2 +\ud835\udc42 (\ud835\udc3f \u22121), (14)\nindicating that, as expected, the ratio diverges as \ud835\udc3f \u2192 \u221e for any fixed \ud835\udc41 (i.e., the non-interacting configurations become dominant), but does so only linearly with the system size, and with a slope that decreases quadratically with the number of bosons. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the configurations for \ud835\udc41 = 4 considered in Fig. 4(b), still correspond to low values of the ratio, 1 < \ud835\udc45 < 4. The slow linear growth of \ud835\udc45 with \ud835\udc3f implies that the disappearance of the chaotic phase along fixed-\ud835\udc41 trajectories will not be observable for the numerically accessible system sizes. From expansion (14), one can approximate the functional form of \ud835\udc45 isolines in \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc3f-space,\n\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc45 ' 1 2 + 1 2 ( 1 + 8\ud835\udc3f 1 + 2\ud835\udc45 )1/2 , (15)\nas indicated by dotted lines in Fig. 2. The sublinear dependence of the latter boundaries on \ud835\udc3f has an immediate important consequence: Any trajectory towards N \u2192 \u221e at constant nonvanishing filling factor \ud835\udc5b\u2014no matter how arbitrarily small\u2014 will reach \ud835\udc45 = 0 and should exhibit the persistence of the chaotic phase. The asymptotic vanishing of \ud835\udc45 at constant \ud835\udc5b is exponential with \ud835\udc3f,\n\ud835\udc45 ' \ud835\udc3f\u2192\u221e \u221a\ufe02 1 + \ud835\udc5b 1 \u2212 \ud835\udc5b [ (1 + \ud835\udc5b)1+\ud835\udc5b (1 \u2212 \ud835\udc5b)1\u2212\ud835\udc5b ]\u2212\ud835\udc3f , \ud835\udc5b < 1. (16)\nThe influence of the manifold of non-interacting Fock configurations on the formation of the chaotic phase can be nicely observed in the \u3008\ud835\udc5f\u3009 density plots of Fig. 3: As filling factor is reduced at constant Hilbert space size, the ratio \ud835\udc45 increases and the manifold of non-interacting states, which is easily identified as the one emerging from zero energy at small \ud835\udf02, gradually takes over the spectrally chaotic phase. An overall perspective of the development of the chaotic region in \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc3f-space from eigenvector features is provided in Fig. 5(a). There, the figure of merit is the contrast of the variance of ?\u0303?1 at the centre of the chaotic phase, around (\ud835\udf02, \ud835\udf00) = (0.25, 0.5) (see black points in Figs. 3 and 4), with respect to the large-\ud835\udf02 region dominated by the many-particle non-interacting limit, (\ud835\udf02, \ud835\udf00) = (20, 0.5). The data clearly show the emergence of quantum chaos along trajectories at\n5\nfixed \ud835\udc3f and fixed \ud835\udc5b as N \u2192 \u221e. As discussed above, the slow disappearance of chaos at fixed \ud835\udc41 is not visible for the accessible N except for the case \ud835\udc41 = 3. Additionally, in Fig. 5(b), we compare var ( ?\u0303?1 ) to their corresponding GOE values (which we calculated analytically in Ref. [55]), i.e., we quantify how chaotic the system is in relation to the RMT benchmarks. Interestingly, an optimal region, in the latter sense, appears between filling factors \ud835\udc5b = 1 and \ud835\udc5b = 1/2. The analysis of var ( ?\u0303?1 ) /var ( ?\u0303?1 ) GOE at fixedN versus filling factor in Fig. 5(c) furthermore demonstrates that this region extends from \ud835\udc5b ' 1 towards lower filling factors the larger the Hilbert space (e.g., until \ud835\udc5b ' 1/3 for N ' 106), whereas for \ud835\udc5b > 1 the approach to GOE is not accelerated by\nincreasing N . These results indicate that the trajectories at fixed \ud835\udc5b . 1 are the fastest routes to quantum chaos in the BHH.\nThe region of optimal approach to chaos mainly occurs within the range in \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc3f-space characterized by small but nonvanishing values of the ratio \ud835\udc45 [Eq. (13)] of non-interacting to interacting Fock configurations in Hilbert space. A qualitative understanding of the location of this optimal chaotic region in \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc3f-space may be obtained from the analysis of basic statistical features of the Hamiltonian matrix. First, we consider how the average connectivity in Fock space depends on \ud835\udc41 and \ud835\udc3f, that under the simplifying assumption of even \ud835\udc3f and odd \ud835\udc41 can be\n6\nseen to be (see Appendix A)\nC = 2\ud835\udc41 (\ud835\udc3f \u2212 1) \ud835\udc41 + \ud835\udc3f \u2212 1 , (17)\nand which will behave qualitatively the same for odd \ud835\udc3f and/or even \ud835\udc41 . The latter expression gives the average number of Fock states to which any basis state is connected by \ud835\udc3b. Intuitively, larger connectivity translates into stronger basis mixing, and hence, potentially, a faster development of quantum chaos. The connectivity is asymptotically bounded along trajectories at fixed \ud835\udc41 or fixed \ud835\udc3f by 2\ud835\udc41 or 2(\ud835\udc3f \u2212 1), respectively, while it remains unbounded along routes at constant filling factor. Despite the simple form of Eq. (17), its behaviour at constant Hilbert space size is not straightforward to read. A numerical analysis reveals that at fixed N , the average Fock space connectivity is maximized at filling factors that asymptotically converge to \ud835\udc5b = 1, as shown in Fig. 6. Such maximal connectivity singles out the trajectory at \ud835\udc5b = 1, and partially correlates with the location of the optimal chaos region, which however also extends to lower \ud835\udc5b, where the connectivity decreases.\nThe analysis of the distributions of diagonal and nonvanishing off-diagonal \ud835\udc3b-matrix elements [with respect to the basis given in Eq. (3)], \u210e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 and \u210e\ud835\udc56\u2260 \ud835\udc57 , respectively, for \ud835\udf02 = 0.25 also offers some relevant information. Specifically, in Fig. 6, we show\nD = \u210e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56 \u2212 |\u210e\ud835\udc56\u2260 \ud835\udc57 | \ud835\udf0e( |\u210e\ud835\udc56\u2260 \ud835\udc57 |) , (18)\nquantifying the distance between the mean values measured in terms of the standard deviation of the off-diagonal distribution. As can be observed, in terms of their average values, the distributions are closer in a region centred around \ud835\udc5b ' 1/2. It is worth mentioning that D in the full Fock basis, i.e., without (anti)symmetrizing the states |\ud835\udc5b1, . . . , \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc3f\u3009, exhibits exactly the same behaviour. Note that the variation of D is not just the result of a trivial shift of the whole diagonal distribution (which would have no consequences in the properties of the energies and eigenvectors), but rather reflects an overall change in the distributions: e.g., \ud835\udc43(\u210e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) broadens and develops a longer tail reaching larger values for high \ud835\udc5b, whereas the dominance of non-interacting configurations induces a drift of the most probable value towards zero and a faster decay for very small \ud835\udc5b. An example of the distributions for different configurations of comparable Hilbert space size is shown in the side panels of Fig. 6. We also checked that the analysis of the distribution widths in relation to the GOE definition [namely whether var(\u210e\ud835\udc56\ud835\udc56) = 2 var( |\u210e\ud835\udc56\u2260 \ud835\udc57 |) holds] shows no distinctive behaviour in the optimally chaotic region. Therefore, the region with densities around 1/2 . \ud835\udc5b . 1, where the fastest approach to quantum chaos is found, stands out according to the presented analysis based on Fock space connectivity and basic statistical properties of \ud835\udc3b."

Dotted curves mark the lines of constant Hilbert space size N = 103, 104, 105, 106 (from bottom to top). Panel (c) shows the ratio var ( ?\u0303?1 ) /var ( ?\u0303?1 ) GOE as a function of filling factor \ud835\udc5b for different Hilbert space sizes. The\nestimation of var ( ?\u0303?1 ) at \ud835\udf02 = 20 follows from a geometrical average over systems at fixed \ud835\udc3f, in order to smooth out \ud835\udc41-parity related effects in the visualization.\nindeed converges to 1 and shares the analytical dependence of the dominant finite-size termwith GOE, albeit with a manifestly different coefficient. On the other hand, at constant filling factor, the vanishing of \ud835\udeff1 with N is unmistakably faster (cf. bottom panel in Fig. 7), with no trace of the (lnN)\u22121 dependence, signalling that along fixed-\ud835\udc5b trajectories \u2329 ?\u0303?1 \u232a bears the same dominant finite-size term as GOE, i.e., with the same coefficient. Additionally, the asymptotic value of \ud835\udeff1 at a givenN diminishes as the filling factor is lowered, reflecting a closer approach to GOE, in agreement with the observations for var ( ?\u0303?1 ) of Sec. III.\nDespite this fast convergence to GOE observed for the mean and the variance of ?\u0303?\ud835\udc5e at constant density, we have shown in Refs. [55\u201357], for filling factor \ud835\udc5b = 1, that, nevertheless, the full probability distributions of ?\u0303?\ud835\udc5e for BHH and GOE in fact become ever better distinguishable from one another whenN is increased. Given the enhanced distance of \u2329 ?\u0303?1 \u232a and var ( ?\u0303?1\n) from GOE along the trajectories at constant \ud835\udc3f, we expect this result to be even more pronounced when approaching N \u2192 \u221e\n8 ~\n~\nP (D~1) N=21N=18N=15N=12N=9\n2000 4000 6000 8000\nat fixed \ud835\udc3f. Figure 8, upper panel, shows the evolution of the probability density functions of ?\u0303?1 for fixed \ud835\udc3f = 9 and increasing \ud835\udc41 from \ud835\udc41 = 9 (N = 12 120) to \ud835\udc41 = 21 (N = 2.1\u00d7106), in comparison with the corresponding probability density functions for GOE. As we discussed in Refs. [55, 57], the GOE distribution is well approximated by a Gaussian. As the particle number and hence the size of Hilbert space increases, the BHH and GOE distributions depart from each other, eventually ending up clearly separated from one another for the largest \ud835\udc41 considered. This behaviour ensues since the distribution widths decrease withN faster than the mean values approach, and is a reflection of model-dependent subleading finite-size corrections in \u2329 ?\u0303?1 \u232a , as we discussed in Ref. [56]. To quantify the distance between the probability densities P(?\u0303?1) and PGOE (?\u0303?1), we compute their Kullback-Leibler divergence, \ud835\udc3e\ud835\udc3f (P,PGOE) [see Eq. (8)]. This distance measure is shown, as a function of N , in the lower panel of Fig. 8, for varying \ud835\udc41 at constant \ud835\udc3f \u2208 [5, 10], and for constant filling factor \ud835\udc5b = 1. The increase of the Kullback-Leibler divergence withN confirms the departure of the probability distributions shown in the upper panel and reveals furthermore that the distributions are further away from each other the smaller \ud835\udc3f is, in agreement with the corresponding larger values of \ud835\udeff1 observed in Fig. 7. This result can be readily explained from the connectivity of the underlying Fock basis states, which is mediated by the tunneling Hamiltonian and yields maximally 2(\ud835\udc3f \u2212 1) transitions from any given Fock state [compare Eq. (17)]. In GOE, on the other hand, transitions are allowed between any pair of states. Hence, at constant N and \ud835\udc5b > 1, the smaller \ud835\udc3f is, the further the Fock space structure imposed by BHH\ndeviates from that of GOE, and consequently the eigenstates would be expected to bear stronger signatures of non-universal features. At constant density, however, connectivity grows with N , and, consequently, the departure between BHH and GOE distributions is slower than at fixed \ud835\udc3f."

            "text": "We have studied the dependence of the chaotic phase of the Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian (BHH) on particle number \ud835\udc41 and system size \ud835\udc3f, and its evolution as the limit of infinite Hilbert space is approached along different directions. The combined analysis of spectral statistics and eigenvector structure, in terms of the generalized fractal dimension ?\u0303?1, confirms that the chaotic phase develops as \ud835\udc41 increases, either at fixed system size or at constant density \u2014no matter how arbitrarily small\u2014, albeit in a quantifiable different way. The observed slow disappearance of chaos along trajectories at constant boson number is explained by the corresponding slow linear divergence of the ratio of non-interacting to interacting basis configurations on these paths. The comparison of the fractal dimension\u2019s fluctuation for near-in-energy eigenstates against the GOE values unveils the existence of an optimal region for the emergence of quantum chaos in \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc3f-space for densities 1/2 . \ud835\udc5b . 1 [Fig. 5(b)], and shows that the trajectories at such constant \ud835\udc5b are the fastest routes to chaos in the BHH. The demonstrated qualitatively basis independent behaviour of var ( ?\u0303?\ud835\udc5e ) [55\u201357] makes this finding a fundamental property of the BHH. The path \ud835\udc41 \u2192 \u221e at fixed \ud835\udc3f leads to a slower convergence of the chaotic phase towards random matrix theory benchmarks. Despite this convergence, in terms of the distribution of the eigenstate generalized fractal dimensions, the ergodic phase of the BHH becomes more distinguishable from random matrix theory for larger Hilbert space. Such departure from GOE is actually faster than along trajectories at constant filling factor. The optimal chaotic region in \ud835\udc41\ud835\udc3f-space exhibits distinct features in terms of Fock space connectivity and basic statistical properties of theHamiltonianmatrix. While further ingredients, such as correlations among the BHHmatrix elements, may play an important role in the formation of the chaotic phase, these results provide an elementary foundation on which a deeper understanding of this optimal behaviour may be built."

            "text": "Here, we provide the derivation of Eq. (17). We consider the subspace H\u2212 with odd \ud835\udc41 and even \ud835\udc3f, for simplicity. In this case, each pair made up of one Fock state |\ud835\udc5b1, . . . , \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc3f\u3009 and its reversed |\ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc3f , . . . , \ud835\udc5b1\u3009 corresponds uniquely to a basis state |\ud835\udc8f\u3009 ofH\u2212, as defined in Eq. (3), and hence the connectivity of |\ud835\udc8f\u3009 is the same as that of |\ud835\udc5b1, . . . , \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc3f\u3009. Furthermore, since the size ofH\u2212 is exactly half of the total Hilbert space, the average connectivities in both spaces coincide. Recall that the size of full Hilbert space reads\nS(\ud835\udc3f, \ud835\udc41) = ( \ud835\udc41 + \ud835\udc3f \u2212 1\n\ud835\udc41\n) . (A1)\nLet us consider first the simpler case of periodic boundary conditions. Any Fock state |\ud835\udc5b1, . . . , \ud835\udc5b\ud835\udc3f\u3009 connects to two other states for each site with a non-vanishing population. Since all\nsites are equivalent, one can simply evaluate the connectivity at any site and then multiply by the number of sites. The number of states with a given occupation \ud835\udc58 at one site \ud835\udc57 is given by the size of Hilbert space for a system with \ud835\udc3f \u2212 1 sites and \ud835\udc41 \u2212 \ud835\udc58 bosons. Summing over 1 \u2264 \ud835\udc58 \u2264 \ud835\udc41 yields the number of all states where site \ud835\udc57 has a nonvanishing connectivity. Therefore,\nCPBC = 2\ud835\udc3f\nS(\ud835\udc3f, \ud835\udc41) \ud835\udc41\u2211\ufe01 \ud835\udc58=1 S(\ud835\udc3f \u2212 1, \ud835\udc41 \u2212 \ud835\udc58) = 2\ud835\udc41\ud835\udc3f \ud835\udc3f + \ud835\udc41 \u2212 1 . (A2)\nIn the case of hard-wall boundary conditions, the only difference is that populated edge sites only contribute with a unit factor to the connectivity, i.e., instead of 2\ud835\udc3f one has an overall multiplicative factor of 2(\ud835\udc3f \u2212 1), yielding\nC = 2\ud835\udc41 (\ud835\udc3f \u2212 1) \ud835\udc3f + \ud835\udc41 \u2212 1 .
