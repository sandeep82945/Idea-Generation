    "abstractText": "Background: To explore the association between social capital and frailty and the mediating effect of health-promoting lifestyles among Chinese older adults, while providing scientific evidence for frailty intervention. Methods: In May 2021, a cross-sectional study was conducted among 674 Chinese older adults in Changsha city. Data was collected using the Chinese Shortened Social Capital Scale (comprising structural social capital and cognitive social capital as two subscales), a simplified version of the Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile and the Tilburg Frailty Indicator. Linear regression analysis was used to examine the association between social capital and frailty. Structural equation modeling was used to test the mediating effect of health-promoting lifestyles. Results: Cognitive social capital was significantly negatively associated with frailty and its three dimensions (physical, psychological, and social frailty), but structural social capital was not. Health-promoting lifestyles played a mediating role in the associations of cognitive social capital with frailty, physical and psychological frailty, but not with social frailty. Conclusions: Higher cognitive social capital was associated with a reduced likelihood of frailty. The health-promoting lifestyles partially mediated the association between cognitive social capital and frailty. The use of health-promoting lifestyles or appropriate cognitive social capital interventions may reduce frailty among older adults.",

Data was collected using the Chinese Shortened Social Capital Scale (comprising structural social capital and cognitive social capital as two subscales), a simplified version of the Health-Promoting Lifestyle Profile and the Tilburg Frailty Indicator. Linear regression analysis was used to examine the association between social capital and frailty. Structural equation modeling was used to test the mediating effect of health-promoting lifestyles.\nResults: Cognitive social capital was significantly negatively associated with frailty and its three dimensions (physical, psychological, and social frailty), but structural social capital was not. Health-promoting lifestyles played a mediating role in the associations of cognitive social capital with frailty, physical and psychological frailty, but not with social frailty.\nConclusions: Higher cognitive social capital was associated with a reduced likelihood of frailty. The health-promoting lifestyles partially mediated the association between cognitive social capital and frailty. The use of health-promoting lifestyles or appropriate cognitive social capital interventions may reduce frailty among older adults.\nKeywords: Social capital, Health-promoting lifestyles, Frailty, Older adults\n\u00a9 The Author(s) 2022.

            "text": "The aging of a population is a major social problem worldwide, affecting all aspects of the economy, politics, social development, and the health care system [1]. In the field of public health, the prevention of aging-related diseases (including cognitive impairment, disability, frailty, etc.) is a trending topic. Among them, as a disease syndrome closely related to age, frailty has become an important criterion for the evaluation of the health status of older adults [2]. The core feature of frailty is the decline in the physiological capacity of multiple organ systems, leading to increased susceptibility to stressors [3]. Metaanalysis results have indicated that frailty increases the risk of a series of negative health outcomes [4], such as mortality [5], hospitalization [6], disability [7], falls [8], fractures [9], and dementia [10]. In recent years, with the increase in the aging population, the incidence and prevalence of frailty has also been increasing. The results of a systematic review indicated that among non-frail\n*Correspondence: ii10233972@163.com 2 Department of Social Medicine and Health Service Management, Xiangya School of Public Health, Central South University, Changsha 410078, China Full list of author information is available at the end of the article\nindividuals with a median follow-up time of 3 years, the combined incidence of frailty was 43.4 per thousand person-years [11]. A meta-analysis of older adults in communities in low-income and middle-income countries revealed that the combined prevalence of frailty was 17.4%, and the prevalence of prefrailty was 49.3% [12]. Considering the negative health status caused by the high incidence and prevalence of frailty and related factors, should be explored to provide scientific evidence for the prevention of, and intervention for, frailty in older adults.\nThe mechanism of the occurrence and development of frailty is more complicated, and is the result of the interaction of many factors. At present, a considerable number of studies have explored the factors related to frailty in older adults. A literature review revealed that sociodemographic factors (such as sex, age, education level, and income) [13], physiological factors (such as genes, inflammatory factors, body composition, and malnutrition) [14\u201317], chronic diseases (such as diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and stroke) [18], lifestyles (such as physical activity, sedentary lifestyle, fruit and vegetable consumption, and dietary patterns) [19\u201321] and psychological factors (such as stress, depression, and anxiety) [22\u201324] may cause frailty. In addition, studies have also found that social factors such as social isolation [25], frequency of interaction with relatives and friends [26], and social support [27] were associated with frailty. However, the social factors in these studies were predominantly examined at individual level, and few studies investigated the association between overall social factors, such as social capital, and frailty [28, 29].\nSocial capital refers to the social resources and benefits that individuals obtained through contact with others [30], and are usually divided into two aspects: Structural social capital and cognitive social capital [31]. The structural aspect refers to externally observable social resources, such as social networks and social participation, and the cognitive aspect reflects the subjective attitude and evaluation of social relations, such as trust and the norms of reciprocity [31]. Social capital is considered to be a positive social determinant of health [32], and a large number of studies have confirmed that it is significantly related to physical and mental health [33, 34]. In addition, increased evidence indicates that interventions related to social capital can significantly improve the health of older adults and promote healthy aging [35]. A previous review emphasized the need to investigate the impact of social capital on frailty in older adults in the context of the rapid growth in global life expectancy and aging [36]. However, there is limited empirical research exploring the relationship between social capital and frailty in older adults. Previous studies on the frailty and aging cohort in Korea have indicated that insufficient\nsocial capital is significantly related to frailty [28]. However, the study defined insufficient social capital as a lack of participation in social gatherings [28], and Japanese research on frailty factors only reflected social capital from three aspects: social participation in activities, trust in the community, and interaction with neighbors [29]. These definitions and assessment contents were evidently one-sided and failed to reflect the true meaning of social capital. Therefore, it is necessary to adopt more comprehensive social capital assessment tools to better explore its association with frailty.\nIn addition, to better prevent and intervene with regard to frailty in older adults from the social capital perspective, the potential mediating factors in the relationship between to social capital and frailty should be understood. The model of the social determinants of health maintains that personal health is primarily affected by four aspects, namely, 1) general social factors, such as social economy, culture, and environment, 2) living and working conditions, 3) community network, and 4) personal lifestyles [37]. Among them, social factors are considered to be upstream determinants, that can have an indirect impact on individual health through downstream lifestyle factors [38]. Previous studies have found that social capital can indirectly affect health through lifestyles [39]. However, it remains unknown whether the mediating role of healthy lifestyles can be generalized to the relationship between social capital and frailty. Considering that lifestyles are significantly related to social capital and frailty [40, 41], the above-mentioned mediation effect may also be established, but there is no research to confirm it.\nTherefore, the objective of this study was to investigate the association between social capital (including structural and cognitive social capital) and frailty (including physical, psychological, and social frailty) of older adults. We also explored the potential mediating role of healthpromoting lifestyles in the association between social capital and frailty. We developed the following priori hypotheses: 1) Social capital will be positively correlated with frailty; 2) Health-promoting lifestyles will mediate the relationship between social capital and frailty."

In addition, a previous study also revealed that greater social cohesion can prevent frailty among older adults in the community [54]. Social cohesion is the result of a complex process involving factors such as the quality of the neighborhood, the individual\u2019s mental and physical condition, the individual\u2019s subjective assessment of the community, and the nature and quality of social contacts [55].

This implies that individuals who perceive greater cohesion may be more willing to participate in such activities. In this process, physical fitness is strengthened and psychological and social needs are met, resulting in the possibility of frailty being reduced. Reciprocity refers to the ability to give something in return for receiving, and embodies mutual help and support between individuals [57]. A previous study found that recognizing the norms of reciprocity can prevent or reduce the loss of frail older adults\u2019 own resources, thereby promoting their health [58]. In addition, reciprocity can encourage individuals to participate in voluntary services and sports activities [59], and promote the dissemination of health information [60], all of which are beneficial for reducing frailty in older adults.\nHowever, inconsistent with the results of previous studies that indicated that social activities influenced frailty [29], the relationship between structural social capital and frailty was not statistically significant. A previous study has suggested that links between social structure and health largely depend on the quality of selfexperience in the individual\u2019s life [61]. In other words, if individuals with higher structural social capital do not have good cognition and experience of the social environment, they still cannot use those social resources to benefit their health. Previous studies have also suggested that structural social capital and cognitive social capital have different effects on health outcomes [62]. This is mainly reflected in the fact that structural social capital\naffects health through participation in social activities [63], while cognitive social capital does this through controlling risky behaviors, reducing stress and providing mutual assistance and support [64, 65]. In addition, previous studies also suggested that cognitive social capital is a stronger protective factor for depressive symptoms than structural social capital, and cognitive social capital mediates the relationship between structural social capital and depressive symptoms. It may be inferred from this that the relationship between structural social capital and frailty may be hidden by cognitive social capital. In view of the lack of relevant research evidence, further exploration is needed in this regard.\nThis study also found that health-promoting lifestyles mediated the associations of cognitive social capital with frailty, and the physical and psychological frailty dimensions. This study preliminarily elucidated the mechanism of association between cognitive social capital and frailty, and provided a scientific basis for further targeted intervention. This mediating effect was mainly divided into two stages, namely, 1) cognitive social capital had a positive impact on health-promoting lifestyles, and 2) health-promoting lifestyles had a negative impact on frailty. Both of these stages have been confirmed in previous studies [40, 66\u201368], which provides sufficient literature support for this study. Individuals with higher cognitive social capital have a stronger sense of social identity and closer neighborhood relationships, that enable them to encourage each other to cultivate a healthy lifestyle [69], and the improvement of lifestyle promotes physical and\nNote: beta standardized coefficient, CI confidence interval, SE standardized error, NA not applicable\npsychological health [70], resulting in a lower risk of frailty. It is worth noting that there was no statistically significant association between the health-promoting lifestyles and the social frailty dimension, that led to the failure of the mediation effect. This may have been because the measurement content of social frailty in this study was whether participants lived alone, their desire for others\u2019 company and whether they received help from others. Logically speaking, whether individuals adopted a healthy lifestyle did not appear to affect their social frailty in this study. This result lacks literary support, and further exploration is necessary in the future.\nThis study has important scientific and practical significance for the prevention and intervention of frailty. First, this study supplements the literature elucidating the association between social capital and frailty in older adults. Second, to our best knowledge, this is the first study to explore the mediating of health-promoting lifestyles in the association between the social capital and frailty. It presents novel discovery on the mediating mechanism underpinning the association between the social capital and frailty among older adults. Third, this study can provide new ideas for the prevention and intervention of frailty. Findings of this study suggest that in the future, we can implement interventions on frailty from the perspective of cognitive social capital and health-promoting lifestyles. Chinese community health care workers can consider formulating community frailty intervention plans. On the one hand, they can enhance the cognitive social capital of the older adults by organizing collective health-related activities and building community mutual assistance platforms. On the other hand, they can strengthen health education and guide the older adults to develop healthy lifestyles such as physical exercise and reasonable diet, thereby reducing the occurrence of frailty.\nThis study has some limitations. First, our research is cross-sectional, which makes it impossible to clarify the causal relationship and the direction of effect among social capital, health-promoting lifestyles, and frailty. In the future, longitudinal studies or intervention studies can be conducted to further confirm the longitudinal association or causality between them. Second, the social capital assessment tool used in this study is different from previous research, so we need to be cautious about the comparison of study results with previous study results. In the future, the same assessment tools as this study can be used to further verify the results of this study. Third, all surveys were self-reported, and that may have introduced information bias. Finally, our sample was only selected from one city in China, so the research results may not be\ngeneralizable to older adults in other countries and regions."
