This paper explores the emergence and global spread\nof the disease and focuses on the role of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in containing\nits transmission. To the best of our knowledge, there has been no scientific\npresentation of the early pictorial representation of the disease\u2019s spread.\nAdditionally, we outline various domains where AI has made a significant impact\nduring the pandemic. Our methodology involves searching relevant articles on\nCOVID-19 and AI in leading databases such as PubMed and Scopus to identify the\nways AI has addressed pandemic-related challenges and its potential for further\nassistance. While research suggests that AI has not fully realized its potential\nagainst COVID-19, likely due to data quality and diversity limitations, we review\nand identify key areas where AI has been crucial in preparing the fight against\nany sudden outbreak of the pandemic. We also propose ways to maximize the\nutilization of AI\u2019s capabilities in this regard.\nKEYWORDS\nCOVID-19, novel coronavirus, artificial intelligence, Monkeypox, ChatGPT\n1. Introduction\nThroughout history, our world has confronted several pandemics, including the Spanish flu of 1918, the HIV/AIDS crisis in the 1980s, and the H1N1 influenza pandemic in 2009. These events have posed significant challenges to healthcare systems and spurred innovative responses. The World Health Organization (WHO) along with different governmental administrators have come together periodically to battle against these pandemics so far. In recent times, the COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the importance of advanced technologies in disease control. Coronaviruses are RNA viruses that belong to the coronaviridae family, having four reported genera, i.e., alpha (\u03b1), beta (\u03b2), gamma (\u03b3), and delta (\u03b4). Among which alpha and beta coronaviruses infect mammals, whereas gamma and delta coronaviruses infect birds. Further, \u03b1-coronaviruses comprise human coronaviruses 229E (HCoV 229E) and NL63 (HCoV-NL63), while \u03b2-coronaviruses constitute human coronaviruses such as HKU1, OC43, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERSCoV-2) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The currently emerging novel coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 causing COVID-19 has also been classified in the genera of \u03b2-coronaviruses. Almost all types of coronaviruses show zoonosis (transmission through a vector host/reservoir) or, have an intermediate host including SARS CoV-2. Zoonotic transmissions of Coronavirus infection are depicted in Figure 1 (Chan-Yeung and Xu, 2003; Alimadadi et al., 2020).\nFrontiers in Artificial Intelligence 01 frontiersin.org\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have proved to be a boon in the battle against COVID-19. AI-driven tools have been used for early detection by analyzing large sets of medical data, tracking the virus\u2019s spread, optimizing resource allocation, and expediting vaccine development. Machine learning and data analysis, facilitated by AI, have provided valuable insights into virus behavior and epidemiological trends, aiding decisionmakers in implementing effective strategies. AI\u2019s contributions have not only improved our ability to respond to crises but have also reshaped our approach to public health and disease management in the modern era of research and healthcare. Various researchers have proposed that ML algorithms can be employed to integrate and analyze the extensive data of COVID-19 victims. This provides insight into the virus\u2019 propagation pattern, which potentially increases the diagnosis rate and efficiency. It also assists in the development of new clinically effective methods which identify the most vulnerable patients based on their unique genetic and physiological characteristics (Alimadadi et al., 2020). This study reviews the existing state of AI applications while battling COVID19, driven by the need to underline the importance of deploying AI in resisting the COVID-19 disaster. We present a comprehensive analysis of studies on the virus\u2019 overall impact, as well as the technology used to combat the COVID-19 pandemic (Chan-Yeung and Xu, 2003)."

            "text": "We have witnessed a couple of major developments in the preceding decades where the transmission of beta corona viruses from animals to human beings has resulted in critical illness. The initial occurrence of such a disease was 18 years back in 2002, when a novel \u03b2 coronavirus originated in bats transmitted over to humans through palm civets prevalent in China, especially in the Guangdong region. This was characterized as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and resulted in 916 casualties in China and Hong Kong (Chan-Yeung and Xu, 2003). Later in the year 2012 another \u03b2 coronavirus, i.e., Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus emerged in Saudi Arabia acquired through dromedary camels to humans and caused 858 fatalities (Memish et al., 2020). In December 2019, a number of unknown cases of pneumonia like symptoms were identified in Wuhan, China. After investigations, it was reported to be a strain of novel coronavirus SARS-CoV (SARS-CoV-2) (Wang L. S. et al., 2020) causing the coronavirus disease later termed as \u201cCOVID19\u201d by the World Health Organization (WHO). Though having a low mortality rate, the current strain, SARS-CoV-2, was found to be highly infectious and transmissible as compared to the other two coronaviruses viz. SARS-CoV and MERS, thus posing a major challenge for inhibiting and treating this viral infection.\nOn February 29th, 2020, the number of cases reported of SARS-CoV-2 infection had rapidly reached up to 79,394, while the number of deaths recorded peaked up to 2,838 within a very short span of 2\u20133 months since the first case was recorded (Sun et al., 2020). Afterwards, it rapidly transmitted through China, Italy, and Iran, epicenters of Asia, Europe, and Middle East and, respectively, to all over the world. Figure 2 indicates the epidemiological flow of COVID-19 from China to other places in the world (Sun et al., 2020). As of June 2020, the total number of reported cases\nworldwide were 173 and 3.7 million people have succumbed to death till then. This article reviews and presents a brief insight into the advancements in studies, particularly concerning artificial intelligence, that have taken place over time."

More infections were spread because of migration and the gathering of many people around the Chinese New Year. Cases in various Chinese provinces and neighboring countries have been reported in people who arrived after attending a festival in Wuhan. Workers in the health sector who had contact with those patients and their families were later tested positive (Shereen et al., 2020; Singhal, 2020).\nBecause of the high rate of disease transmission, Wuhan was placed under lockdown on February 23rd, 2020. Patients reported in other countries who had not traveled in a while suggested that local transmission of the virus had occurred in these countries. WHO declared it a pandemic on March 11, 2020, and named\nthe current human coronavirus disease COVID-19. Passengers experiencing symptoms were screened at airports and isolated for testing. Researchers discovered that the virus could spread from patients who have no symptoms, or who are asymptomatic. As a result, the countries that evacuated their citizens from China placed everyone, regardless of symptoms, in a 2-week quarantine and tested them for the virus (Rothe et al., 2020).\nA group of Italian tourists was reported to have been infected in India, and later, a patient who flew from Italy contracted the disease along with his six family members. These were the first cases in India in February 2020, which quickly increased in March. To prevent further disease transmission, the entire country was placed under lockdown beginning in March. Those who displayed\nFrontiers in Artificial Intelligence 04 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 5 Chronological order of COVID-19 transmission.\nsymptoms were tested and quarantined for 14 days (Pulla, 2020). By the end of March 2020, new cases had decreased in China but had begun to increase rapidly in Iran, Italy, and South Korea, which were later controlled, and the rate of disease spread was eventually reduced in these countries. Following that, in April 2020, a sudden increase in cases was reported from the United States, Britain, India and many other countries.

They gave a complete picture of vulnerable patients from every part of the world. Local and global dashboards are the two primary categories of data visualization systems. For a wider population of COVID-19, Johns Hopkins University\u2019s Center for System Science and Engineering (JHU-CSSE) created the COVID-19 dashboard. The New York Times provided a virus infection dashboard for several parts of the world as well (Anastassopoulou et al., 2020). The AI tracker of Bing was trained to display diagnosed, cured, and deceased cases from across the world. This filter was used on a specific country for displaying infected people from a certain province. Big data was required for further analyzing medication discovery, risk assessment, infection spread, therapy, and cure of COVID19 infected patients using Artificial Intelligence approaches. Text, social media, biomedical, speech, and case studies are some of the broad categories for the datasets. The COVID-19 datasets are broadly classified as shown in Figure 7 (Anastassopoulou et al., 2020).\nText datasets included risk variables, non-pharmaceutical interventions, virus infection propagation, incubation period, and environmental stability. Most of the tweets about COVID-19 contained myths and incorrectly classified information about coronaviruses (Abd-Alrazaq et al., 2020; Minaee et al., 2022). To address this issue, various fake news and rumor detection techniques have been proposed. Due to the open-source nature of the COVID-19 chest X-ray dataset, medical images were used\nto train deep learning or machine learning models (Hughes et al., 2020). According to another study, COVID-19 can also be distinguished by its vocal sounds. The University of Cambridge scholars requested that participants\u2019 voice samples be collected to create an open-source cough sample repository. The COVID-19 databases were issued by the World Health Organization and the National Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to track the progression of infection and analyze the influence of preventive measures.

For that reason, the medical report must be generated quickly and at a reduced cost. Therefore, COVID-19 patients were also screened using AI-based approaches. There were three main AI-based strategies for screening patients namely face recognition, wearable devices, and virtual healthcare assistant as shown in Figure 8.

Researchers have put forward a deep convolutional neural network design which was termed as COVID-net where chest X-ray (CXR) images have helped in diagnosing COVID-19. It was developed earlier, as studies which observed those cases, showed irregularities in chest radiography images that were symbolic to those individuals who got infected with COVID-19 (Mahase, 2020). Emara et al. (2021) provided two solutions for an automated COVID-19 diagnostic system. The first was based on transfer learning models that have been pre-trained with chest X-ray scans as input. To achieve this, they employed pre-trained models such as AlexNet, GoogleNet, Inceptionv3, InceptionresNetv2, SqueezeNet, DenseNet201, ResNet18, ResNet50, ResNet101, VGG16, and VGG19. The second method focuses on creating a CNN termed CONV-COVID-net from scratch to identify COVID-19. ResNet models namely ResNet18, ResNet50, and ResNet101 achieved the maximum classification accuracy on the two datasets. According to the results, they achieved 97.67, 98.81, and 100% accuracy using the first dataset, respectively. On the other hand, the reported accuracies for the second dataset were 99, 99.12, and 99.29%, respectively (Chen et al., 2020; Kanne, 2020; Emara et al., 2021). Using a combination of deep convolutional neural network (CNN) and discrete wavelet transform (DWT) attributes, Mostafiz et al.

We experimented to bridge this gap by not only developing a classifier for COVID-19 detection but also shedding light on how the model arrives at its conclusions. To achieve this, we integrated Grad-CAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) into our research methodology. Grad-CAM is a technique known for its ability to generate visual explanations. These explanations help us understand the specific areas within the X-ray images that influenced the model\u2019s decisions. This step is crucial for making AI-driven diagnostic systems transparent and interpretable, which is vital for clinical applications.\nThe integration of Grad-CAM allowed us to validate our model\u2019s predictions post-analysis and provided valuable insights into the inner workings of the model. By examining Grad-CAM visualizations, clinicians and healthcare professionals can gain a deeper understanding of which regions within the chest X-rays played a significant role in shaping the model\u2019s diagnosis. This not only enhances transparency but also facilitates clinical decisionmaking.\nIn Figure 9, we showcase a selection of Grad-CAM visualizations. These figures demonstrate how our model identified specific features within the images to distinguish between COVID-19-positive and normal cases. Each visualization highlights the regions of interest identified by the model, helping to demystify the decision-making process. This approach underscores the importance of model transparency and the potential of explain ability techniques like Grad-CAM to make AI-based diagnostics more accessible and trustworthy in the context of COVID-19 and beyond.\nFigure 10 compares the average accuracies of different AI algorithms used in diagnosing COVID-19 as mentioned in literature. Deep Convolutional Neural Network ResNet-101 gave the best results achieving an accuracy of 99.51% while Support Vector Machine (SVM) was the least effective with an overall accuracy of 77.50% (Young et al., 2021). A real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) was the most extensively utilized technology for diagnosis (Zhu et al., 2020). X-ray and CT scans are two widely recognized radiological imaging methods (Irshad et al., 2023) because RT-PCR has a low sensitivity (60\u201370%), symptoms could be recognized using\nradiological imaging (Alam et al., 2021b). For instant results, automated evaluation of CT scans and chest X-rays through ML or deep learning approaches were adopted (\u00c7alli et al., 2021), these methods assisted in speeding up the analysis process considerably (Alam et al., 2021a). Chinese scientists created the InferVISION healthcare application to analyze COVID-19 patients using VIDIA\u2019s Clara SDK, it could detect positive instances in a very short span of time. There was a deficiency of clinical expertise in contrast to the number of COVID-19 patients during the pandemic, as a result AI-based tools and methods were used to swiftly diagnose patients (Hasan et al., 2023).\nSimilarly, Hemdan et al. (2020) built a framework named COVIDX-Net for analyzing X-ray images and tested over 50 Xray images using seven distinct deep learning models with a 90% accuracy rate. In a similar way, Wang L. et al. (2020) created the COVID-Net model, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) model for detecting infections in chest X-ray images. The COVIDNet model correctly identified normal, typical pneumonia, and COVID-19 patient 93.3% of the time (Juneau et al., 2023). Ko et al. (2020) used chest CT to build an FCONet model for the classification of COVID-19. VGG16, ResNet50, InceptionV3, and Xception were used by FCONet. FCONet\u2019s performance was tested on 3,993 chest CT images. ResNet50 provided a precision of 96.97%. Tan et al. (2021) used a combination of the SRGAN model and VGG16 to diagnose infected individuals using chest CT. The resolution of CT scans was improved using SRGAN. VGG16 was employed to distinguish between the diseased and healthy CT regions, over 275 COVID-19 and 195 normal CT scans. The generated model was validated and produced classification accuracy of 97.87% (Beck et al., 2020).\nLikewise, a deep learning model for diagnosing chest X-ray images was created by Jain et al. (2021). The suggested model was built using IncpetionV3, Xception, and ResNeXt. The training and testing accuracies of classification derived from this model were 99 and 96%, respectively. For diagnosing the COVID-19 infection in patients, Islam et al. (2020) used an amalgamation of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM). The model\u2019s performance was verified on 4,575 X-ray pictures. This model had a sensitivity of 99.3% and a specificity of 99.2%, respectively (Islam et al., 2020).\nTo evaluate the above results, there are four possible possibilities in the confusion matrix. The number of accurately diagnosed anomalous instances is known as true positive (Tp). The number of accurately diagnosed normal instances is known as true negative (Tn). The collection of normal instances identified as anomalous cases is known as false positive (Fp). The collection of abnormal cases observed as normal cases is known as false negative (Fn). Sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), accuracy (AC), precision (PR), mis-classification rate (MR), and false positive rate (FPR) are all used to evaluate the overall performance of each deep learning classifier (Jensen, 1986) (Table 1)."

More patient data exchange, as well as ML approaches that would enable models to be built whilst limited data is accessible, would help. Few-shot learning, in which AI can understand patterns from a limited number of findings, along with transfer learning, in which an AI that has successfully received training to achieve one task could be swiftly changed to perform some another similar task, are examples of potential gains. Such proactive approaches align well with the evolving landscape of infectious disease management and underscores AI\u2019s pivotal role in safeguarding global public health in the future. However, there is still more work to be accomplished. In addition, we can also explore the use of large language models, namely ChatGPT or Google Bard in case of any future pandemic outburst (Sohail et al., 2023a).\nAI language models like ChatGPT hold significant potential for future pandemics. They can play a vital role in disseminating accurate information to the public, answering queries about prevention, symptoms, testing, and vaccination, thus aiding in education.

However, the studied approaches have some limitations as well. For example, these algorithms are not a sure diagnostic tool to identify the patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 virus nor a complete treatment for the patients. To design an integrated tool that can help healthcare officials and patients, a robust mechanism is needed. Moreover, identifying the algorithm which could perform better in the established approaches based on various deep learning and related mechanism would be pivotal for creating options for such pandemic. For example, according to Devaraj et al.\n(2021), in Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Stacked LSTM (SLSTM), and Prophet for time series forecasting, SLSTM is superior in accuracies than other models.\nFurthermore, not only identifying patients with similar symptoms or trying to provide an AI based early treatment would be sufficient in near future, rather an approach needs to be devised that can also resist the spread and outbreak of such a pandemic in near future.

For instance, social media booms can leverage the information propagation regarding pandemic. It can thus be used to inform its users regarding safety parameters and measures to avoid pandemic spread. Moreover, it can also be helpful in capturing real-time public opinion and hence can serve better in generating a consensus on the solutions to such global emergencies like COVID-19 and Monkeypox, etc. Like, with the help of sentiment analysis and state-of-the-art techniques in NLP, the public perception on a certain event can be assessed (Aslani and Jacob, 2023). These events may include finding out the opinion of a common man on vaccine delivery, and exploring their responses to the safety measures and their feedback on how they are been treated by medical practitioner at hospitals, etc.\nSimilarly, SOS can be alerted and provided across these social platforms.
