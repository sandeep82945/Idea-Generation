"Improvement of the A. neopropionicum–C. kluyveri co-culture could include determining a more optimal pH of operation that could also support higher substrate loading rates. In our bioreactor experiment, increasing the pH from 7 to 7.3 boosted ethanol consumption and chain-elongating activity of C5–C7 carboxylates (phase G, Fig. 6). A pH of 7.3 is closer to the optimum for A. neopropionicum [54], and it also contributes to alleviating carboxylic acid toxicity. Among the other strategies, in-line product extraction has been shown to significantly enhance production rates by reducing product inhibition [18, 39, 41, 63]. Biomass retention, either via anaerobic filter reactors or membrane modules, has also been demonstrated to improve production rates [38, 41]. A key finding of our study is that, in line with the work on C. kluyveri by Candry and co-authors [51], odd-chain elongation was favoured under ethanol limitation, which can be achieved in controlled chemostat cultivation. Therefore, this approach should be kept in mind when targeting the production of OCCAs via ethanol-driven chain elongation."
