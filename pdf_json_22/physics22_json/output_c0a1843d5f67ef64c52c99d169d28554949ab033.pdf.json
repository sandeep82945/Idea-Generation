The application of uniaxial stress along the [010] direction induces a sudden change in the resistivity ratio \u03c1a/\u03c1b at a compressive strain of \u03f5 \u2248 \u22120.5%. Here we use neutron scattering to show that the uniaxial stress induces a first-order transition to a SDW state with a different propagation vector (0, \u03b4B , 1/2) with \u03b4B = 0.25. The magnetic structure of the new (B) phase consists of Ce layers with ordered moments alternating with layers with zero moment stacked along the c-axis. The ordered layers have an up-up-down-down configuration along the b-axis. This is an unusual situation in which the loss of spatial inversion is driven by the magnetic order. We argue that the change in SDW wavevector leads to Fermi surface reconstruction and a concomitant change in the transport properties.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nHeavy fermions systems1,2 are metals incorporating elements with partially filled 4f or 5f shells with heavy electron quasiparticles which show masses of up to 100 times those in a conventional metal. Our understanding of cerium-based heavy-fermion materials is based on the Kondo lattice model3. Ce 4f electron spins are localised at high temperatures leading to a small Fermi surface. As the temperature is lowered, the f electrons are screened by other electrons, below a characteristic Kondo temperature TK they become itinerant and the Fermi surface volume increases. The magnetism in heavy fermion systems is described by a Ruderman\u2013Kittel\u2013Kasuya\u2013Yosida (RKKY) exchange interactions between localised moments or by a wavevector dependent susceptibility derived from the electronic band structure involving the itinerant f electron states.\nHeavy fermions (and other strongly correlated systems) are delicately balanced systems with competing interactions which can be perturbed by hydrostatic pressure, uniaxial stress or magnetic field. Hydrostatic pressure increases the overlap and hybridisation of the atomic orbitals and can lead to a transition from the localised to delocalised f electrons4 and a corresponding collapse of magnetic order2. Heavy fermion systems can also be very sensitive to the application of a magnetic field. For example, for CeAuSb2\n5\u20137, applying a field causes a transition between magnetically ordered states and the suppression of magnetic order. More recently, resistivity measurements under uniaxial stress8,9 have revealed an additional phase transition in CeAuSb2. Here we use neutron scattering to show that this is a transition to a new magnetic\nstate and determine the nature of the order.\nCeAuSb2 is a heavy-fermion antiferromagnet 5,10 with linear coefficient of specific heat \u03b3 \u2248 0.5 JK\u22122 mole\u22121, a Kondo temperature of \u223c14 K and SDW order below TSDW \u2248 6.5 K at zero stress and magnetic field. It crystallises with a tetragonal space group P4/nmm in a quasi-2D structure that consists of alternating CeSb-Au and CeSb-Sb planes stacked along the c-axis and the inplane Ce-Ce bonds are along a/b axes. The application of a magnetic field5,6 along the c-axis leads to a magnetisation curve M(B) with metamagnetic anomalies and resistivity anomalies at \u00b50B1 = 2.78 T and \u00b50B2 = 5.42 T. These anomalies can be used to identify two phases A and A\u2032 as shown in Fig. 1. Neutron diffraction measurements by Marcus et al.7 show that the A phase is a SDW state with ordering wavevectors q1,2 = (\u03b4A,\u00b1\u03b4A, 0.5), where \u03b4 = 0.136, and an ordered-moment polarised along the c-axis. The absence of third harmonics of q1 led Marcus et al. to conclude that the magnetism in CeAuSb2 requires an itinerant description of the f electron states in contrast to systems such as CeSb11 which show strong third harmonics and require a RKKY model. Marcus et al. found that the A phase has single-q SDW domains with q1 or q2 order and microscopic orthorhombic symmetry. In contrast, the A\u2032 is found to have a multi-q structure in which modulations with wavevectors q1, q2, and q1 \u00b1 q2 co-exist.\nThe fact that a modest magnetic field can induce changes in the structure of the SDW order suggests that CeAuSb2 may have multiple nearly-degenerate ordered states. Another useful perturbation or tuning parameter is uniaxial stress applied, for example, along the \u27e8100\u27e9- type lattice direction of the tetragonal parent structure. In this paper we designate the axis along which stress\nar X\niv :2\n20 2.\n11 56\n9v 2\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .s\ntr -e\nl] 3\n1 Ju\nl 2 02\n3\n2\nis applied as the b-axis, or [010]. In contrast to applying the field along [001], this perturbation breaks the tetragonal lattice symmetry. The temperature/strain/magnetic field diagram of CeAuSb2 has been extensively studied by transport and heat capacity6,8,9 (see Fig. 1 for a summary). Stress applied along [010] induces a transition into a new \u201cB phase\u201d at a strain of \u03f5 \u223c \u22120.5% (where negative \u03f5 denotes compressive strain) at the lowest temperatures. The transition to the B phase is characterised by a sudden jump in the resistivity which suggests a first order transition, in particular, the resistivity along the [100] is enhanced. An analogous anisotropy in resistivity is induced in the SDW phases of Sr3Ru2O7 when a component of magnetic field is applied along [100]12,13.\nIn order to understand the unusual transport properties of the CeAuSb2 B phase it is important to establish the nature of the SDW order. Here we report neutron diffraction measurements performed with in-situ uniaxial stress. Our measurements reveal that the B phase has a single-q SDW order with the moment polarised along the c-axis and propagation vector, qB = (0, 0.25, 0.5). The most obvious mechanism responsible for the anisotropic resistivity is a Fermi surface reconstruction caused by the SDW. In addition, the phase diagram of CeAuSb2 has a strong similarity to those of the other heavy-fermion systems CeNiGe3 14, CeRh2Si2 15 and YbNiSi3\n16, which suggests that the phenomenology we will describe here might be rather common. In all these compounds, the easy axis is the c-axis, and transition from the zero-field magnetic order to a homogeneously-polarized state occurs via two first-order metamagnetic transitions, through an intermediate phase with higher resistivity."

            "text": "The sample was mounted in a piezoelectric actuated uniaxial stress apparatus adapted for use in neutron scattering and muon spin rotation experiments. The apparatus and mounting procedure are described in detail in Ref. 20. The sample was cut into a bar of approximate dimensions 3.1 mm x 1.3 mm in the ab plane using a\n3 wire saw, and polished to a thickness of 0.21 mm along the c-axis. The sample ends were epoxied into the apparatus using de-gassed Stycast 2850FT prepared with the catalyst 23LV. Cadmium foil (which is strongly neutron absorbing) was used to mask the parts of the apparatus, epoxy exposed to the neutron beam and the end portions of the sample where the strain inhomogeneity was expected to be greatest. As will be discussed below, we observe that some portion of the sample exposed to the neutron beam remained unstrained. The exposed length of sample was approximately 2.2 mm.\nThe sample holder incorporates a force sensor, and the cell a displacement sensor. Over the entire range of force explored here, the displacement was linear in applied force, indicating that both the sample and epoxy holding it were within their elastic limits. The force sensor was calibrated by hanging weights from the holder, and yields the stress in the sample. Due to deformation of the epoxy holding the sample the displacement sensor cannot be used as an accurate sensor of the strain in the sample.\nNeutron diffraction measurements were performed on WISH a time-of-flight (TOF) diffractometer at the ISIS neutron source, UK21. The axis of the uniaxial stress cell was vertical, perpendicular to the (horizontal) scattering plane (H, 0, L). The sample was cooled to base temperature, 1.7 K, (in the presence of exchange gas) before stress was applied. Data were taken at two temperatures (1.7 K and 5.5 K) and a maximum compressive stress of \u03c3010 = 440 MPa. For all stresses, the force and displacement measured by the strain gauge circuits were proportional indicating the sample did not crack.\nThe lattice strain along a and c (i.e. transverse to the compressive uniaxial stress) could be resolved in the d-spacing of the nuclear Bragg peaks. At non-zero stress, Bragg peaks measured in backscattering geometry (where the d-spacing resolution is highest) exhibit a shoulder at the d-spacing of the unstrained peak indicating that some of the sample (\u2248 20%) was unstrained.\nDue to limited detector coverage out of the horizontal plane it was not possible to measure the b lattice parameter directly and the elastic constants of CeAuSb2 have not been measured (so b cannot be inferred from the measured strain along the a and c axes). Further details can be found in Appendix A.\nFor determination of the UB matrices used to index reflections in the remainder of this work, we assume that the unit cell volume is conserved under uniaxial stress (isochoric distortion). This condition sets the b-axis Young\u2019s modulus to be 95 GPa, and can be considered to set a lower bound on the magnitude of the b-axis strain. Comparison of the data here with the phase diagram of Ref. 8 indicates a Young\u2019s modulus of \u2248 60 GPa. It will be shown that the uncertainty on the b lattice parameter\ndoes not impact the conclusions of this paper.\nThe single crystal data were integrated using the Mantid software22. The data were corrected for the Lorentz factor, normalised to the total current and incident flux and to a vanadium standard sample run to account for detector efficiency. The data were also corrected for absorption using a cylindrical shaped crystal as approximation for the sample shape. The refinements of the nuclear and magnetic structures were performed using the Jana2006 software23 for data collected on a single crystal orientation at 1.7K at two stresses \u03c3010 = 0 MPa and \u03c3010 =440 MPa. Structures are displayed using the MVISUALIZE software24,25. Cif and mCif files of all the structures refined are reported as supplementary information.26"

            "text": "Fig. 3(a) shows the scattering intensity in the (H,K, 0.5) plane at selected stresses at the two temperatures measured. At zero stress and zero magnetic field, CeAuSb2 exhibits incommensurate SDW order (A phase). The parent P4/nmm space group gives rise to two symmetrically equivalent domains of single-q order with propagation vectors q1,2 = (\u03b4A,\u00b1\u03b4A, 0.5), producing four satellite peaks shown in Fig. 3a (as seen previously in Ref. 7).\nThe compressive stress along the b-axis induces a new mono-domain of single-q SDW order in the B phase with wave-vector qB = (0, \u03b4B , 0.5). The SDW order in A & B phases doubles the unit cell along the c-axis, in contrast to the SDW order in the magnetic-field-induced A\u2032 phase7. In addition it can be seen that the boundary between the A & B phases occurs at a lower stress at 5.5 K (see Fig. 1) and that there is some phase coexistence near the phase boundary (most evident in the 1.7 K data at \u03c3010 = 272 MPa). Phase coexistence would be expected at a first-order transition, but there may also be a contribution from the inhomogeneity of the applied strain.\nFig. 3b shows the integrated intensity of magnetic Bragg peaks in the A & B phases as a function of compressive stress at the two temperatures measured 1.7 K and 5.5 K (after subtraction of a temperature and stress independent linear background). The resistivity for a current applied parallel and perpendicular to the compressive strain as a function of strain at 1.5 K from Park et al.8 is also reproduced with the axis scaled to the stress used in this experiment using a Young\u2019s modulus of E = 60 GPa, that provides a rough agreement between the observed phase boundary at low temperature.\nFrom Fig. 3b it can be seen that at both tempera- tures measured the SDW intensity in the A phase does\n5 not respond strongly to compressive stress along b until the onset stress for the B phase is reached (this can also be seen in the raw data shown in Fig. 3c). The onset of the B phase peak intensity is correlated with the reduction in A phase peak intensity, which plateaus at a low value slightly above the background at a stress of \u03c3010 \u2248 272 MPa and \u03c3010 \u2273 320 MPa at 5.5 K and 1.7 K respectively. The residual A phase peak intensity at the largest stress measured is roughly 20% of the average zero stress intensity at both temperatures, which is consistent with the volume fraction of the sample under stress determined from the fits to (003) peak (see Appendix A)."

            "text": "In Fig. 3c we show the scattered intensity for magnetic Bragg peaks in the A and B phases. Data are shown at the minimum and maximum stress measured in each phase at 1.7 K. The peaks were fitted with a Gaussian peak convoluted with a back-to-back exponential (the same profile used to fit the nuclear Bragg peaks). The d-spacing of the A phase reflection (indicated by the dashed line in Fig. 3c - which does not coincide with the maximum of the peak due to the asymmetric pulse shape from the moderator) exhibits a weak dependence on stress, with a barely resolvable shift to lower d-spacing for \u03c3010 = 272 MPa. If the incommensurability of the A phase wavevector, \u03b4A, were to remain at the zero stress value, the d-spacing would be expected to increase sightly by approximately the same magnitude as the observed peak shift (the momentum transfer has only a small component along the compressed axis, b, and the a and c lattice parameters are increasing due to the Poisson\u2019s ratio of the material). There is no resolvable shift is observed in the d-spacing of the B phase peak.\nUnder the assumption of an isochoric lattice distortion, we have determined the incommensurability, \u03b4A/B , of the modulation vectors from the d-spacing of the magnetic reflections using a total of 8 peaks (4 symmetrically inequivalent) and 6 peaks (3 symmetrically inequivalent) for the A and B phase respectively. Fig. 3d shows the refined incommensurability as a function of stress. Note for the A phase at finite stress the modulation has been assumed to maintain the tetragonal symmetry (i.e. the component of the modulation along a and b has been assumed to be equal) - this is reasonable given the distortion is small and the phase does not appear to couple strongly to stress.\nThe incommensurability of the A phase at zero stress, \u03b4A = 0.137(2), is consistent with the value found by Marcus et al.7. These data suggest that \u03b4A may decreases slightly with \u03c3010 (of the order of 1% over the extent of the phase).

Taking into account these facts, we approached the refinement of the magnetic structure in the B phase of CeAuSb2 assuming a commensurate propagation vector. In this scenario, the symmetry of the magnetic structure depends on the global phase of the modulation, resulting in a several possible origin choices. Another important symmetry aspect is the existence of linear-cubic free energy invariants which provide a coupling between mB1(\u03b71, \u03b7 \u2217 1) and mB3(\u03b73, \u03b7 \u2217 3), \u03b71\u03b7 3 3 +\u03b7 \u2217 1\u03b7 \u22173 3 , and between mB2(\u03b72, \u03b7 \u2217 2) and mB4(\u03b74, \u03b7 \u2217 4), \u03b72\u03b7 3 4+\u03b7 \u2217 2\u03b7 \u22173 4 , order parameters. These invariants are symmetric with respect to the subscript indices and the coupling terms \u03b73\u03b7 3 1+\u03b7 \u2217 3\u03b7 \u22173 1 and \u03b74\u03b7 3 2 + \u03b7 \u2217 4\u03b7 \u22173 2 are also allowed. This implies that in the case of commensurate ordering, the corresponding order parameters can be mixed without changing the magnetic symmetry of the system. ThemB1 andmB3 irreps transform the magnetic modes with the moments along the a-axis of the Pmmn space group, while mB2 and mB4 transform the modes with the moments along the b- and\nc-axes. The magnetic phases of the spin density waves localized on the Ce sites with z=0.235 and z=0.765 in the parent structure, differ by \u03c0 in the magnetic modes which belong to the different irreps. Quantitative refinement of the measured magnetic intensities revealed that, similar to the A phase, the Ce moments in the B phase are predominantly polarized along the c-axis which is common for both tetragonal P4/nmm and Pmmn space groups. Moreover, the refinement has been found to be sensitive to the admixture between mB2 and mB4 irreps, yielding equal weight for both order parameters, as well as to their relative magnetic phases. The best fitting quality was achieved in the model shown in Fig. 5 with reliability factors R = 5.62% and RW = 6.41%. This solution implies the orthorhombic polar symmetry Abem2, making CeAuSb2 an exciting system, where loss of spatial inversion is driven by magnetic ordering. This phenomenon is well known for insulators such as type II multiferroics33, but it rather rare for metals34,35.\nRefinement of the neutron diffraction data assuming the incommensurate propagation vector provided a worse fitting quality with a RW reliability factor of 8.6% compared to 6.4% for the commensurate Abem2 with the same number of refinable variables. In this case, two magnetic superspace groups Pmmm1\u2032(0, \u03b2, 1/2)s0ss and Pmmm1\u2032(0, \u03b2, 1/2)s00s associated with mB2 and mB4 irreps cannot be distinguished. In both models, the Ce moments are aligned along the c-axis and the difference stands to the relative magnetic phases for the spin density waves localized on the Ce sites with different z-coordinate in the parent structure. No admixture of the irreps is allowed for the incommensurate propagation vector. Due to the worse fitting quality, the observed propagation vector and the symmetry reasons discussed above, we believe the incommensurate scenario is less likely and we do not discuss it further. The proposed commensurate magnetic structure, shown in Fig. 5, involves alternation of the Ce layers which carry magnetic moments of 1.15(4)\u00b5B at 1.7K with zero-moment layers. In the former, the ordering is up, up, down, down upon propagation along the b-axis."

            "text": "A. The magnetism of CeAuSb2\nThere are two paradigms in which to consider the magnetism in this compound: the localised limit and the itinerant limit in which the Ce moments are screened by the conduction electrons. As discussed above, previous neutron scattering measurements suggest that the itinerant limit is appropriate here7. The refined wavevector of the B phase is consistent within the error with a commensurate modulation, qB = (0, 0.25, 0.5). We note that\n8 this conclusion is not impacted by the negligible systematic uncertainty on the b-axis lattice parameter. A commensurate wavevector does not necessarily imply localmoment order. For example, dilute chromium alloys36 and the iron pnictide superconductor BaFe2As2 37 exhibit a first-order incommensurate-commensurate transition that arises from slightly imperfect nesting between electron and hole-pockets, which in both of the above compounds can be tuned with doping. Unlike an incommensurate sinusoidal modulation, the free energy of a commensurate modulation depends on the phase. It might be energetically favourable to preserve a constant moment across all sites (which would hint at local moment behaviour), or conversely to have nodes of zero amplitude on specific sites (which is incompatible with local moments). This can force a modulation to \u2018lock-in\u2019 on a commensurate value even if the ideal nesting is slightly incommensurate38. For example, such a mechanism is believed to be behind the incommensurate-commensurate transitions of the charge-density wave in 2H-TaSe2 39.\nOverall the observed magnetic structure of the B phase that includes Ce sites with zero magnetic moment, shown in Fig. 5, and the detailed symmetry analysis reported in Sec. III-C suggest that the order in CeAuSb2 is closer to the itinerant limit. We note that the presence of sites with zero-magnetic moments is not unique in metallic systems and it has been observed in other SDW ordered materials such as in the C4 phase of iron-based superconductors40,41\nThe present work taken together with the previous neutron study7 shows that the SDW state of CeAuSb2 may be switched by the application of magnetic field or uniaxial stress. However, it should be noted that magnetic field and uniaxial stress couple to the SDW in different ways. The field causes a field-dependent exchange splitting between up- and down-spin bands, whereas the uniaxial stress modifies the hybridisation, for example, between the f electrons and conduction electrons. At the lowest temperature the SDW phase transitions are first order with a change in the symmetry of the order parameter. The ordering in SDW systems can be often be understood in terms of the wavevector-dependent susceptibility \u03c7(q) calculated from the Lindhard function. In the case of CeAuSb2 we would then expect \u03c7(q) to be sufficiently field and stress dependent that the SDW ordering wavevector can switch between different q\u2019s. To date, a detailed connection between the electronic structure/Fermi surface the ordering wavevectors has not been identified, however, published band structures7,42 do offer possibilities for nesting. We note that a Fermi surface that shows topological reconstruction as a function of magnetic field has been proposed in the sister compound Sr3Ru2O7 which also exhibits a SDW controlled by magnetic field13,43."

            "text": "Previous transport measurements have mapped out the temperature-strain-magnetic field phase diagram of CeAuSb2\n6,8,9. The neutron diffraction data presented here are qualitatively consistent with the published phase diagram8,9. In particular we observe the onset of magnetic Bragg scattering associated with the B phase at a lower stress at 5.5 K than 1.7 K. The present data shed new light on the anisotropic transport observed inside the B phase. The onset of B phase order as a function of stress at low temperature is associated with a first-order step in the resistivity perpendicular to the axis of compression8. We can now identify the axis of the enhanced resistivity as perpendicular to the observed wavevector in the B phase (i.e. \u03c1\u22a5 > \u03c1\u2225). The opposite trend is observed in Sr3Ru2O7 12,13 and in Cr44 (\u03c1\u2225 > \u03c1\u22a5). As the B phase exhibits only one domain the enhanced resistivity is intrinsic to the order (i.e. not due to scattering at domain walls).\nSDW order causes Fermi surface reconstruction45 and therefore changes in transport properties such as resistivity (\u03c1) and Hall number (nH) in materials such as Cr 36 and Sr3Ru2O7 13. Here \u03c1 and nH derive from integrals of the Fermi velocity and other quantities over the Fermi surface. We argue, by analogy, that this mechanism is responsible for dramatic changes seen in \u03c1 for CeAuSb2 on entering the B-phase [See Fig. 3(b)]. The re-constructed Fermi surface produced by the single-q SDW leads to an anisotropic \u03c1 as is the case for Cr and Sr3Ru2O7."

            "text": "The main result of this work is that compressive uniaxial stress applied along the [010] axis of tetragonal CeAuSb2 induces a phase (B phase) with a mono-domain of single-q SDW order with commensurate wavevector qB = (0, 0.25, 0.5) producing a structure that breaks spatial inversion symmetry. The B phase of CeAuSb2 is one of small number of metals34,35 where the loss of spatial inversion is driven by magnetic ordering. The component of qB in the ab-plane is parallel to the direction of the applied stress. This contrasts with A phase (in the absence of stress) where the SDW has wavevectors qA = (0.136,\u00b10.136, 0.5). We believe that the change in SDW wavevector leads to a Fermi surface reconstruction which is reflected in a change in transport anisotropy. CeAuSb2 is a good system to test this mechanism because a single domain SDW can be prepared. A similar mechanism may occur in other materials where magnetic field or strain-dependent anomalies in resistivity are observed including Sr3Ru2O7\n12,13, URu2Si2 46, CeNiGe3 14,CeRh2Si2 15 and YbNiSi3 16.\n9"
