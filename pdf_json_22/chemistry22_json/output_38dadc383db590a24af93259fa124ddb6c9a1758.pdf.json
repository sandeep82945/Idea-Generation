    "abstractText": "Messenger RNA (mRNA) is emerging as a promising therapeutic modality for a variety of diseases. Because of the fragility and limited intracellular access of mRNA, the development of delivery technologies is essential for promoting the applicability of mRNA-based treatments. Among effective nanocarriers, polymeric micelles loading mRNA by polyion complex (PIC) formation with block catiomers have the potential to meet the delivery needs. Since PICs are relatively unstable in in vivo settings, herein, we constructed mRNA-loaded micelles having pH-responsive crosslinked cores by complexing mRNA with cis-aconitic anhydride-modified poly(ethylene glycol)-poly (L-lysine) (PEG-pLL(CAA)) block copolymers. The micelles were stable at physiological pH (pH 7.4) but achieved the complete release of the mRNA at endosomal pH (pH 5.5\u20134.5). The cross-linking also enhanced the stability of the micelles against disassembly from polyanions and protected the loaded mRNA from degradation by nucleases. Thus, the cross-linked micelles increased the delivery of mRNA to cancer cells, promoting protein expression both in vitro and in vivo. Our results highlight the potential of PEG-pLL(CAA)-based micelles for mRNA delivery.",

            "text": "Messenger RNA (mRNA)-mediated transfection, which offers in situ production of therapeutic proteins, is rising as an attractive modality for a variety of therapeutic applications, such as vaccination, genome editing and protein replacement [1\u20134]. Compared to plasmid DNA, mRNA does not require transportation through the nuclear membrane and prevents the integration into the genome of the host cell [5], which are substantial advantages for enhanced efficiency and safety. Nevertheless, intracellular access and rapid degradation of mRNA by nucleases remain major issues for maximizing the therapeutic benefits. Delivery systems are central to the success of mRNA therapy [1,5]. Among effective mRNA delivery systems, non-viral vectors offer safety, low immunogenicity, and high loading capacity [6,7]. Especially, polyion complex (PIC) micelles, which are core-shell self-assemblies from block catiomers and oppositely charged ionomers, have shown high potential to protect mRNA from degradation and recognition by immune receptors [8\u2013 10]. However, the stability of PICs is undermined by polyion exchange from negatively charged proteoglycans on cell surfaces and in plasma [11]. Therefore, to improve the performance of mRNA-loaded micelles in vivo settings, major efforts have been dedicated to enhancing the PIC stability, such as introducing hydrophobic moieties in the core forming materials [12,13], engineering the flexibility of the polycation block [14] and using cationic moieties with multivalent interactions [15]. On the other hand, stimuli-responsive stabilization approaches of the PICs could offer effective protection of the mRNA outside the cells while releasing active mRNA upon sensing the environment in subcellular spaces [16\u201320].\nPharmaceutics 2022, 14, 1205. https://doi.org/10.3390/pharmaceutics14061205 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/pharmaceutics\nPharmaceutics 2022, 14, 1205 2 of 11\nParticularly, the difference in the pH of the extracellular environment (pH 7.4) and the acidic pH in endosomes (pH 6.5\u20134.5) [21] provides a useful trigger to generate smart stabilization strategies for mRNA-loaded PICs.

The residual amino groups in the pLL(CAA) segment can promote ion complexation with mRNA, while the reaction between the CAA moieties with the non-complexed primary amines can cross-link the core by forming pH-sensitive amide bonds (Figure 1a) [22]. The pH sensitivity and the stability of the cross-linked mRNA-loaded micelles were tested in vitro. Micelles prepared from PEG-pLL were used as control. Moreover, the ability of the micelles to deliver mRNA and produce proteins was evaluated in cancer cells, as well as in solid tumors in vivo.

PEGpLL(TFA) block copolymer was firstly synthesized by ring-opening polymerization (ROP), taking MeO-PEG-NH2 (Mw = 12,000 g mol\u22121) as the initiator. In brief, MeO-PEG-NH2 (1 g, 0.083 mmol) and Lys(TFA)-NCA (1 g, 3.75 mmol) were separately dissolved in 10 mL anhydrous DMF. The two solutions were then mixed under Ar flow and allowed to react in a 35 \u25e6C water bath for 48 h. The mixture was precipitated in diethyl ether to obtain PEGpLL(TFA). GPC measurement was performed on the TOSOH HLC-8220 system (TOSOH, Tokyo, Japan) equipped with TSK gel G4000HHR and G3000HHR columns and an internal refractive index (RI) detector. PEG Standards ReadyCal kit (Sigma-Aldrich, Saint Louis, MO, USA) containing PEG with different molecular weights (range from ~250 to ~45,000 Da) was used for the calibration. Measurement was conducted at 40 \u25e6C in DMF containing 10 mM lithium chloride at a flow rate of 0.8 mL min\u22121. Polymers were firstly dissolved in DMF containing 10 mM lithium chloride at 1 mg/mL and filtered through RephilQuick Syringe Filter (PTFE, 13 mm, 0.45 \u00b5m) before GPC analysis. Deprotection of the TFA group was completed by dissolving the collected PEGpLL(TFA) in methanol with 1M NaOH and kept reacting in a 35 \u25e6C water bath for 12 h. The mixture was purified by dialysis against 0.01 M HCl and pure water (molecular weight cut-off (MWCO): 6000\u20138000 Da), then lyophilized to get the PEG-pLL. The degree of polymerization (DP) of the lysine groups was determined by 1H-NMR (400 MHz, JEOL ECS-400, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) in D2O, and the polydispersity of the polymer was tested by the aqueous GPC (Extrema 4500 Model, JASCO) (eluent: D-PBS, pH 7.4; temperature: 25 \u25e6C; flow rate: 0.75 mL min\u22121; detector: UV 220 nm). PEG-pLL(CAA) block copolymer was synthesized by further conjugating CAA molecules to the lysine block of the PEG-pLL via a condensation reaction between an acid chloride and amine. Briefly, CAA (153 mg, 1 mmol) was reacted with oxalyl chloride (2 mL, 2.5 g, 20 mmol) at 25 \u25e6C for 12 h to prepare the acid chloride of CAA (CAA-Cl). The CAA-Cl was purified by vacuum evaporation to totally remove the excess oxalyl chloride, and the product was collected as an oily liquid. PEG-pLL (200 mg, 0.011 mmol) was reacted with the prepared CAA-Cl at 25 \u25e6C in 10 mL anhydrous DMF for 12 h. The PEG-pLL concentration was controlled at 20 mg/mL. The final product, PEG-pLL(CAA), was obtained by precipitating the mixture in diethyl ether. The number of CAA units in PEG-pLL(CAA) was confirmed by 1H-NMR in DMSO-d6 at 80 \u25e6C."

When the polymer is dissolved in acidic buffer (pH < 4), PEG-pLL(CAA) will remain in free polymer form with the protonated amines and the dehydrated anhydride structure. However, when mixing this polymer with mRNA in pH 8 buffer, the residual amine groups in the PLL block will complex with mRNA, and the CAA will react with the amines to cross-link the core of the micelles. The control PEG-pLL/m were assembled by mixing the PEG-pLL with gLuc mRNA in 10 mM HEPES buffer, as previously reported [14]. The size of the two micelles was examined by DLS. PEG-pLL and PEG-pLL(CAA) formed micelles of approximately 70 nm and 90 nm in diameter, respectively (Figure 1b and Table 1). In the following studies, FCS was applied for a detailed molecular characterization of the complexation behavior of mRNA with polymers because FCS is a powerful and versatile tool for nanocarrier characterization. In particular, FCS can monitor and quantify the size of the nanoparticles, drug loading efficiency, nanoparticle stability and possible interactions with plasma proteins as well as cargo release under physiologically relevant triggers [24]. First, the encapsulation of mRNA in the micelles was determined by FCS. The diffusion coefficient of free Cy5-labeled mRNA (19.95 \u00b1 1.98 \u00b5m2/s) decreased after mixing\nwith the block copolymers (12.07 \u00b1 0.87 \u00b5m2/s for PEG-pLL/m, 10.94 \u00b1 2.50 \u00b5m2/s for PEG-pLL(CAA)/m), which indicated the successful encapsulation of mRNA in the micelles. Moreover, by comparing the ratio of the counts per molecule between the micelles and Cy5-labeled mRNA, it was found that both PEG-pLL/m and PEG-pLL(CAA)/m have around 1 mRNA per micelle (Table 1). The encapsulation of the mRNA PEG-pLL(CAA)/m was close to 100% (Table 1).\nThe pH sensitivity of the micelles was also evaluated by FCS after incubating the micelles in 10 mM HEPES buffer with 150 mM NaCl with different pH. Here, to better understand the micelle disassembly process, the diffusion coefficient of micelles in the different pH buffers was normalized with the initial diffusion coefficient of each micelle. In the complexation of PEG-pLL(CAA) and Cy5-mRNA, the normalized diffusion coefficient increased from 1.05 to 1.76 when the pH decreased from 6.5 to 4.5, i.e., the endosomal pH range, which indicates PEG-pLL(CAA)/m gradually disassociated as a result of acidification. At pH 4.5, the diffusion coefficient of PEG-pLL(CAA)/m (19.11 \u00b1 1.33 \u00b5m2/s) was close to that of naked mRNA (19.95 \u00b1 1.87 \u00b5m2/s), indicating the complete release of mRNA. On the other hand, the normalized diffusion coefficient of PEG-pLL/m remained stable, indicating that the PEG-pLL/m kept associated with Cy5-mRNA when decreasing the pH (Figure 1c)."

Thus, we evaluated the stability of the micelle in the presence of negativelycharged dextran sulfate at pH 7.4. The micelles were incubated at different sulfate in dextran sulfate/phosphate in mRNA (S/P) ratios for 1 h, and the diffusion coefficient of Cy5-labeled mRNA was measured by FCS. In the PEG-pLL/m, the mRNA was completely released from the micelles at S/P = 2. On the other hand, the diffusion coefficient of the PEG-pLL(CAA)/m remained stable even at S/P = 4 (Figure 2a), suggesting the ability of the cross-linked micelles to retain mRNA. The capability of micelles to protect the loaded mRNA from enzymatic degradation was investigated by qRT-PCR after incubating with 10% FBS. The results showed that more than 66% of the mRNA was still detectable in PEG-pLL(CAA)/m compared to 25% of the mRNA in the PEG-pLL/m (Figure 2b). These results suggest that the core crosslinking by CAA significantly protected mRNA from polyanion and nuclease attacks, which demonstrates the advantage of the proposed pH-sensitive cross-linking strategy."

After incubating CT26 cells with the PEG-pLL and PEG-pLL(CAA) polymers for 24 h, we found that both polymers are not cytotoxic at concentrations lower than 25 \u00b5g/mL (Figure S3a). Thus, polymer concentrations lower than 25 \u00b5g/mL were used in the following cellular studies. The cellular uptake was evaluated by CLSM using Cy5-labeled mRNA and PEG-pLL/m and PEG-pLL(CAA)/m loading Cy5-labeled mRNA.\nAfter 6 h incubation with the mRNA-based formulations, we found that the cellular uptake of mRNA was improved by the micelles (Figure 3). Moreover, the Cy5 signal in the cells treated with PEG-pLL(CAA)/m was 2-fold higher than that of PEG-pLL/m (Figure 3a\u2013 d). These results can be associated with the enhanced stability of the PEG-pLL(CAA)/m against polyanion exchange, as the proteoglycans on the cell membranes can disturb the PIC complexes through polyanion exchange, posing a major barrier to the internalization of carriers based on PIC assembly [28]. Thus, PEG-pLL(CAA)/m allowed higher stability against the polyanion exchange than PEG-pLL/m, resulting in a higher cellular uptake. Pharmaceutics 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 8 of 12\nFigure 2.

First, we confirmed the safety of the block copolymers by studying their in vitro cytotoxicity. After incubating CT26 cells with the PEG-pLL and PEG-pLL(CAA) polymers for 24 h, we found that both polymers are not cytotoxic at concentrations lower than 25 \u00b5g/mL (Figure S3a). Thus, polymer concentrations lower than 25 \u00b5g/mL were used in the following cellular studies. The cellular uptake was evaluated by CLSM using Cy5-labeled mRNA and PEG-pLL/m and PEG-pLL(CAA)/m loading Cy5-labeled mRNA. After 6 h incubation with the mRNA-based formulations, we found that the cellular uptake of mRNA was improved by the micelles (Figure 3). Moreover, the Cy5 signal in the cells treated with PEG-pLL(CAA)/m was 2-fold higher than that of PEG-pLL/m (Figure 3a\u2013d). These results can be associated with the enhanced stability of the PEG-pLL(CAA)/m\nagainst polyanion exchange, as the proteoglycans on the cell membranes can disturb the\nPIC complexes through polyanion exchange, posing a major barrier to the internalization\nof carriers based on PIC assembly [28]. Thus, PEG-pLL(CAA)/m allowed higher stability\nagainst the polyanion exchange than PEG-pLL/m, resulting in a higher cellular uptake.\nThe ability of the micelles to produce proteins in the cells was evaluated by testing\nthe luminescence levels after treatment with gluc mRNA-loaded micelles. Here, we used\ncommercial PEI-based polyplexes as a positive control. The PEG-pLL(CAA)/m showed a\nsignificant 16-fold higher gluc expression than PEG-pLL/m (Figure 3e). These results can be associated with the enhanced capability of PEG-pLL(CAA)/m to protect mRNA from nuclease attack and promote intracellular delivery compared to PEG-pLL/m. Nevertheless, the in vitro transfection efficiency of the micelles was much lower than that of the positive control PEI-based polyplexes. It is worth noting that, while PEI exhibited high transfection efficacies, high cytotoxicity was also observed for PEI even at the recommended working concentration (Figure S3b), probably due to its strong membrane disrupting ability [29].\nFigure 2.

These micelles were stable at pH 7.4, while they dissociated to release mRNA when the pH was decreased below 6.5. The ability of the PEG-pLL(CAA)/m to remain stable at pH 7.4 allowed robust stability against polyanion exchange and nuclease attack. Thus, PEG-pLL(CAA)/m were able to promote intracellular delivery and gene expression in both in vitro and in vivo studies. Moreover, the PEG-pLL(CAA)/m provided higher gene expression in murine tumors compared to the commercial transfection reagent PEI. Our findings demonstrated the potential of the PEG-pLL(CAA)-based micelle system for mRNA delivery, confirming the feasibility of introducing pH-responsive covalent cross-linking for enhancing the in vivo performance.\nSupplementary Materials: The following supporting information can be downloaded at: https: //www.mdpi.com/article/10.3390/pharmaceutics14061205/s1, Figure S1: (a) GPC chromatogram of PEG-pLL(TFA) (1 mg/mL, solvent: DMF with 10 mM lithium chloride, temperature: 40 \u25e6C, flow rate: 0.8 mL min\u22121) (b) 1H-NMR of PEG-pLL (polymer concentration: 10 mg/mL, solvent: D2O, and temperature: 25 \u25e6C), Figure S2: 1H-NMR of PEG-pLL(CAA) (polymer concentration: 10 mg/mL, solvent: DMSO-d6, and temperature: 80 \u25e6C), Figure S3: Viability of CT26 cells by CCK-8 assay after incubation with (a) polymers at 1 \u00b5g/mL, 3 \u00b5g/mL, 6 \u00b5g/mL and 25 \u00b5g/mL and (b) PEI at 0.01\u00d7, 0.1\u00d7, 0.3\u00d7, 0.6\u00d7, 2.5\u00d7 and 5\u00d7 the recommended concentration for 24 h.
