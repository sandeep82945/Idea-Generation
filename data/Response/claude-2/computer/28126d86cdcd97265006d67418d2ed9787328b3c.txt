 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming the paper:

1. Investigate different encoder-decoder architectures besides SqueezeNet and ResNet for the two stages of the framework to optimize performance. For example, experiment with more lightweight models like MobileNet or efficient models like EfficientNet.

2. Explore different attention mechanisms like channel attention, dual attention, or spatial-channel attention to see if they can further improve the segmentation performance.

3. Evaluate the framework on additional cardiac MRI datasets beyond ACDC and MyoPS to analyze generalization ability across datasets. 

4. Extend the framework to do multi-class segmentation to delineate additional cardiac structures like the aorta, atria, valves, etc.

5. Modify the framework into a 3D end-to-end volumetric segmentation model rather than 2D slice-by-slice to better capture 3D spatial context.
