Development of Predictive Models for Other Viscoelastic Materials: Building on the understanding that stress is a more universal measure of nonlinearity strength, develop and validate predictive models for the MAOStress response of other viscoelastic materials with different microstructures or relaxation spectra. This research could focus on materials with broad industrial applications, such as polymers used in medical devices, to understand their behavior under stress and potentially improve material formulations.

Investigation of Frequency-independent Critical Stress: The observed slight variation in critical stress across different frequencies suggests a more universal characteristic of viscoelastic materials' behavior. Future work could explore this phenomenon across a broader range of materials, including those with significantly different microstructural features or relaxation dynamics, to test the universality of this finding and understand its underlying mechanisms.

High-throughput MAOStress Characterization Techniques: Leverage the insight that the critical stress required to measure MAOStress nonlinearities changes minimally with frequency, significantly less so than with MAOStrain measurements. Develop and optimize high-throughput stress-controlled characterization techniques that could simplify and expedite the study of viscoelastic materials under oscillatory shear, reducing experimental times and improving efficiency.

Exploration of Nonlinearity Origins in Complex Fluids: Utilize the MAOStress framework to systematically explore the origins of nonlinearity in a wide range of complex fluids, including suspensions, gels, and biological materials. This research could aim to uncover the relationship between microstructural dynamics (e.g., polymer chain orientation, cross-link density) and the observed macroscopic stress response, providing deeper insights into the materials' behavior under practical conditions.

Development of New Material Models Incorporating Stress-based Nonlinearity Measures: Inspired by the success of the SSTNM model in capturing the strain-stiffening behavior of PVA-Borax, develop and validate new theoretical models that incorporate stress as a fundamental measure of nonlinearity strength. These models could provide a more accurate representation of material behavior under oscillatory shear, particularly in stress-controlled scenarios, and could be used to design materials with tailored mechanical properties for specific applications.
