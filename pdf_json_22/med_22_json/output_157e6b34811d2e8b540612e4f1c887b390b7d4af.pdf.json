Methods and materials: From January 2008 to December 2014, the clinicopathological data of 479 patients who underwent radical resection for esophageal cancer in the Fourth Hospital of Hebei Medical University were collected and retrospectively analyzed. The influencing factors of postoperative abdominal lymph node metastasis were analyzed, and a predictive model was constructed based on their independent influencing factors. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was utilized to analyze the predictive value of this model; in the meantime, the postoperative locoregional recurrence (LRR) of this group was analyzed. Results: The postoperative pathology of all patients showed that the lymph node metastasis rate (LNR) was 39.7%, of which the abdominal lymph node metastasis rate was 22.0%. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the patient\u2019s lesion location, pN stage, vascular invasion, LND and mediastinal lymph node metastasis were independent risk factors for the positive rate of abdominal lymph nodes after surgery (P= 0.000, 0.000, 0.033, 0.000, 0.000). The probability of abdominal lymph node metastasis was Y = ex/ (1 + ex), and X =\u22125.502 + 1.569 \u00d7 lesion location + 4.269 \u00d7 pN stage + 1.890 \u00d7 vascular invasion + 1.950 \u00d7 LND-4.248 \u00d7mediastinal lymph node metastasis. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) of this model in predicting abdominal lymph node metastasis was 0.962 (95% CI, 0.946\u20130.977). This mathematical model had a high predictive value for the occurrence of abdominal lymph node metastasis (P= 0.000), and the sensitivity and specificity of prediction were 94.6% and 88.3% respectively. The overall survival rate was significantly higher (X2= 29.178, P= 0.000), while abdominal lymph node recurrence rate was lower in patients with negative abdominal lymph nodes than in those with negative lymph nodes (1.4%&7.7%, X2= 12.254, P=0.000).\n01 frontiersin.org\nFrontiers in Surgery\nConclusion: The lesion location, pN stage, vascular invasion, LND and mediastinal lymph node metastasis are independent influencing factors of abdominal lymph node metastasis in patients with TESCC. The mathematical model constructed by these indicators can accurately predict abdominal lymph node metastasis, which can help clinicians to choose the targets for postoperative radiotherapy.\nKEYWORDS\nesophageal tumor/esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, abdominal lymph node metastasis, mediastinal lymph node metastasis, prediction model, prognosis, postoperative radiotherapy"

            "text": "Radical surgical resection is the mainstay of treatment for patients with operable esophageal cancer (EC), and the postoperative pathology of patients has shown that positive lymph node is a predictor of poor prognosis (1\u20133), and due to the complexity of the arrangement of the lymphatic drainage system in the esophageal wall, lymph node metastasis is characterized by certain regularity and incomplete predictability (4). Therefore, it is common that patients with thoracic EC have positive abdominal lymph nodes after surgery (5\u20137). The prediction of presence or absence of abdominal lymph node metastasis before clinical treatment may affect the choice of surgical approach by the surgeons, and also the choice of the targets for radiotherapy by the radiotherapists (8\u201310). Therefore, the effective prediction of presence or absence of abdominal lymph node metastasis before treatment of patients with EC has aroused great attention in clinical research. In this study, we aimed to predict the probability of metastasis before clinical treatment by analyzing the relationship between related indicators, including the general clinical data and postoperative pathology of EC patients, and the nature of postoperative abdominal lymph nodes, in order to avoid unnecessary surgical damage or reduce the targets for radiotherapy, and guide the choice of treatment scheme by clinicians. Therefore, we conducted a retrospective analysis of 479 patients undergoing surgery for EC in our research center."

            "text": "Abdominal lymph node area is one of the most common site for lymph node metastasis for patients with thoracic EC. Previous studies have shown that the occurrence probability of metastasis is 4.0%\u201357.0%. Currently, there has been no consensus regarding the effect of abdominal lymph node metastasis on the prognosis of patients (5\u20138). A retrospective analysis of abdominal lymph node metastasis in 913 patients with middle thoracic EC after surgery by Shen et al. (8) showed that the rate of abdominal lymph node metastasis in all patients was 4.1%, and abdominal lymph node metastasis was an important indicator of patient prognosis (P = 0.000). Chen et al. (9) analyzed 368 patients with middle thoracic EC after surgery, and the results showed that 58 patients (15.8%) had abdominal lymph node metastasis, and the 5-year survival rate of patients with abdominal lymph node\nTABLE 3 Analysis results of local recurrent region of patients.\nRecurrent region Abdominal lymph nodes by\npostoperative pathology N (%)\nPositive Negative\nSupraclavicular lymph node 9 (8.6%) 15 (4.0%)\nMediastinal lymph node 25 (23.8%) 73 (19.5%)\nAnastomosis 3 (2.9%) 8 (2.1%)\nAbdominal lymph nodes 7 (6.7%) 4 (1.1%)\nSupraclavicular and mediastinal lymph node 4 (3.8%) 7 (1.9%)\nMediastinal and abdominal lymph nodes 1 (1.0%) 1 (0.3%)\nAnastomosis and supraclavicular lymph node 0 (0.0%) 2 (0.5%)\nAnastomosis and mediastinal lymph node 1 (1.0%) 2 (0.5%)\nAnastomosis, supraclavicular and mediastinal lymph node 0 (0.0%) 1 (0.3%)\nfrontiersin.org\nmetastasis and those with intrathoracic lymph node metastasis were 10.3% and 18.3% respectively (P = 0.029). Schomas et al. (10) analyzed 310 patients undergoing surgery for EC, and the results indicated that there was no significant difference in the prognosis of patients with respect to abdominal lymph node metastasis and mediastinal lymph node metastasis. In this study, postoperative pathology showed that the rate of abdominal lymph node metastasis rate in 479 patients with thoracic EC in a single center was 22.0%. In addition, the prognosis was significantly worse in patients with positive abdominal lymph nodes than in those with negative lymph nodes, with a median overall survival of 48.7 months and 72.2 months respectively (X2= 29.178, P = 0.000), which is similar to the results of the previous studies.\nAs is known to all, the stage N of EC is closely related to the prognosis of patients. Given the relationship between EC lesion location and the location of lymph node metastasis, the N staging system that integrates the location of lymph node metastasis and the number of metastases may have a greater significance in predicting the prognosis of patients (11). However, the TNM staging system for EC based on postoperative pathology focuses on the number of lymph node metastases in the N staging system, while the tumor location is not mentioned (12). The JESD-TNM staging system focuses on the impact of tumor location on lymph node metastasis, but neglect the effect of the number of lymph nodes on the prognosis of patients (13). The results of this study showed that the status of abdominal lymph nodes revealed by postoperative pathology was closely related to the total lymph node metastasis of patients after pathology. These related indicators included pN staging, LND and mediastinal lymph node metastasis. In order to explore the influencing factors of abdominal lymph node metastasis in TESCC, Li QM et al. (14) constructed a predictive model of abdominal lymph node metastasis of TESCC based on the risk factors, and analyzed the medical records of 443 patients undergoing surgery for EC. The predictive model indicated that for the regrouped patients who had no mediastinal lymph node metastasis or vascular invasion, the probability of abdominal lymph node metastasis at any tumor location was the lowest (11%); on the contrary, when there was vascular invasion and the total number of thoracic lymph node metastasis was \u22653, the probability of abdominal lymph node metastasis at any tumor location could be as high as 80%. Based on the findings of this study and previous studies, we suggest that for patients with positive mediastinal lymph nodes, clinicians should be alert to the possibility of abdominal lymph node metastasis before treatment.\nOur study showed that vascular invasion was a risk factor for abdominal lymph node metastasis. Vascular invasion mainly includes lymphatic invasion, which is the beginning of lymph mode metastasis, and vascular invasion, which is closely related to the blood-borne metastasis of cancer cells.\nFrontiers in Surgery 06\nPrevious studies have shown that vascular invasion is a risk factor for lymph node metastasis, tumor recurrence and poor prognosis in a variety of solid tumors (15\u201317). Currently, few studies are available on the relationship between vascular invasion and abdominal lymph node metastasis after EC surgery. The reason may be that after vascular invasion, cancer cells may penetrate the basement membrane of the relevant vessel wall and pass through its abundant cavity network to spread to the abdominal lymph nodes.\nThe results of this study indicated that tumor location was a risk factor for abdominal lymph node metastasis. The incidence of abdominal lymph node metastasis in patients with upper, middle and lower ESCC was 0%, 19.9% and 36.9%, respectively, suggesting significant differences. It was obvious that the shorter distance between the tumor and the abdomen was associated with the shorter distance of the tumor cells to invade the longitudinal lymphatic vessels in the esophageal wall, and the more likelihood of metastasis. Previous related studies have also shown that the location of lymph node metastasis in EC is closely related to the lesion location (18, 19). Upper thoracic EC is mainly related to metastasis to the cervical and upper mediastinal lymph nodes, lower thoracic EC is mainly related to metastasis to the lower mediastinal and abdominal lymph nodes, and middle thoracic EC is related to metastasis to the neck, chest mediastinum, and abdominal lymph nodes. Previous research results (9, 20, 21) indicated that stage T was an independent influencing factor for abdominal lymph node metastasis of TESCC. In theory, the deeper the tumor invasion, the greater the probability of lymph node metastasis. The results of this study suggested that pT stage was not significantly associated with abdominal lymph node metastasis in patients, which were similar to the findings by Li et al. (14). In their study, the probability of abdominal lymph node metastasis in patients with stages T2 and T3 was three times of those with stage T1. The negative result of our study may be related to the small number of patients with stage T1 (only 13 cases). Therefore, attention should be focused on to the possibility of abdominal lymph node metastasis in patients with late stage T.\nCurrently, surgical resection of EC is still the mainstay of treatment for early and locally advanced thoracic EC. Although advances in surgery, anesthetic techniques as well as improvements in perioperative management have reduced postoperative mortality, this reduction still fails to translated into the benefit of long-term survival of patients, which is primarily related to the high recurrence rate (34%\u201379%) and short remission period (median, 14 months) in patients with EC (22, 23). Therefore, postoperative adjuvant treatment, especially postoperative radiotherapy, is of great significance. Currently, there has been no consensus on the targets for postoperative radiotherapy, especially the range of clinical target volume (CTV). Based on the drainage of the longitudinal submucosal lymph nodes of EC and nodal skip\nfrontiersin.org\nmetastasis, the range of CTV for postoperative radiotherapy in the past (24\u201326) consisted of bilateral supraclavicular area, mediastinal lymph node area and left gastric lymph node drainage area. Such a wide range of irradiation may effectively reduce the chance of local recurrence within the irradiation range (24), which, however, often causes severe gastrointestinal and systemic reactions simultaneously, thereby causing unnecessary radiation damage (27). Therefore, the optimal range of postoperative CTV should involve high postoperative recurrence areas, and reduce the incidence of unnecessary toxic and side effects, with respect to the following aspects (28\u201330): the range of lymph node dissection during surgery, postoperative location of recurrence, presence or absence of preoperative neoadjuvant radiotherapy and location of primary esophageal lesions. The results of this study showed that patients with positive abdominal lymph nodes undergoing surgery for thoracic EC are more likely to experience recurrence of abdominal lymph node than those with negative abdominal lymph nodes. Therefore, it is recommended that the abdominal lymphatic drainage region in these patients should be one of the targets for postoperative radiotherapy."
