    "abstractText": "We show that the nonlinear transport of bosonic excitations in a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice of spin-orbit-coupled Rydberg atoms gives rise to disordered quantum phases which are topological and may be candidates for quantum spin liquids. As recently demonstrated by Lienhard et al. [Phys. Rev. X 10, 021031 (2020)] the spin-orbit coupling breaks time-reversal and chiral symmetries and leads to a tunable densitydependent complex hopping of spin excitations which behave as hard-core bosons. Using exact diagonalization (ED), we numerically investigate the phase diagram resulting from the competition between density-dependent and direct transport terms as well as density-density interactions. In mean-field approximation there is a phase transition from a condensate to a 120\u25e6 phase when the amplitude of the complex hopping exceeds that of the direct one. In the full model a new phase emerges close to the mean-field critical point as a result of quantum correlations induced by the density dependence of the complex hopping. We show that without density-density interactions this phase is a genuine disordered one, has large spin chirality, and is characterized by a nontrivial many-body Chern number. The Chern number is found to be robust to disorder. ED simulations of small lattices with up to 30 lattice sites give indications for a nondegenerate ground state with finite spin and collective gaps and thus for a bosonic integer quantum Hall phase, protected by U(1) symmetry. On the other hand, while staying finite, the many-body gap varies substantially when different twisted boundary conditions are applied, which points to a gapless phase. For very strong negative nonlinear hopping amplitudes we find another disordered regime with vanishing spin gap. This phase also has a large spin chirality and could be a gapless spin liquid but lies outside the parameter regime experimentally accessible in the Rydberg system.",

As recently demonstrated by Lienhard et al. [Phys. Rev. X 10, 021031 (2020)] the spin-orbit coupling breaks time-reversal and chiral symmetries and leads to a tunable densitydependent complex hopping of spin excitations which behave as hard-core bosons. Using exact diagonalization (ED), we numerically investigate the phase diagram resulting from the competition between density-dependent and direct transport terms as well as density-density interactions. In mean-field approximation there is a phase transition from a condensate to a 120\u25e6 phase when the amplitude of the complex hopping exceeds that of the direct one. In the full model a new phase emerges close to the mean-field critical point as a result of quantum correlations induced by the density dependence of the complex hopping. We show that without density-density interactions this phase is a genuine disordered one, has large spin chirality, and is characterized by a nontrivial many-body Chern number. The Chern number is found to be robust to disorder. ED simulations of small lattices with up to 30 lattice sites give indications for a nondegenerate ground state with finite spin and collective gaps and thus for a bosonic integer quantum Hall phase, protected by U(1) symmetry. On the other hand, while staying finite, the many-body gap varies substantially when different twisted boundary conditions are applied, which points to a gapless phase. For very strong negative nonlinear hopping amplitudes we find another disordered regime with vanishing spin gap. This phase also has a large spin chirality and could be a gapless spin liquid but lies outside the parameter regime experimentally accessible in the Rydberg system.\nDOI: 10.1103/PhysRevResearch.5.013157\nI. INTRODUCTION\nOver recent years, Rydberg atoms have become a versatile and robust platform to explore many-body quantum spin physics in the regime of strong correlations [1\u20136] and for quantum information processing [7\u201311]. Using high principal quantum numbers, Rydberg-excited atoms have sizable interactions even at distances of several micrometers, while their lifetime is on the order of milliseconds. These properties make Rydberg atoms especially well suited to explore many-body quantum phenomena such as the recently experimentally realized symmetry-protected topological phases [12] and quantum dimer models [13].\nParticularly interesting and still poorly understood manybody phases of spin systems are those where zero-point quantum fluctuations prevent magnetic order of any kind, which often requires frustration. The possibility of such liquid ground states was first pointed out by Anderson in his seminal 1973 work on antiferromagnets [14,15]. Since then, there has\nPublished by the American Physical Society under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International license.

The QSL may be gapped or gapless and in the first case can be topological, where the topological order either can be protected by symmetries associated with short-range entanglement [24,25] or can be intrinsic, in which case the state is long-range entangled [26,27]. Despite the decades-long interest in quantum spin liquids, their clear identification in realistic materials remains a major challenge due to the scarcity of highly entangled states in real solid-state materials and the lack of simple experimental signatures of spin liquids [28\u201330]. Thus it is natural to ask whether QSLs can be realized in experimentally accessible model systems such as arrays of Rydberg atoms. First signatures of a QSL have indeed been found in such a model system in a recent breakthrough experiment with Rydberg atoms in an artificially assembled two-dimensional array of microtraps [13]. In that experiment, ground and Rydberg states of the atom form a spin- 12 system. The atoms were placed on the links of a kagome lattice and driven under conditions of Rydberg blockade [8], which effectively realizes a quantum dimer model, for which a QSL ground state has been predicted [31,32]. The dimer states are formed by three nearby atoms, out of which at most one can be excited due to Rydberg blockade.\nInspired by recent experimental work [33], we here propose and analyze a lattice spin model, based on Rydberg\n2643-1564/2023/5(1)/013157(13) 013157-1 Published by the American Physical Society\natoms on a honeycomb lattice as shown in Fig. 1, where the competition between nearest and next-nearest XY spin couplings leads to frustration. Different from Ref. [13] the spin degree of freedom is formed by two Rydberg states of the atoms. The spin can hop from one lattice site to the next by dipolar exchange interactions. As shown in Ref. [33], in such systems spin-orbit coupling induced by an external magnetic field explicitly breaks time-reversal and chiral symmetry and leads to a density-dependent, second-order complex hopping of excitations [34] which competes with the direct hopping. The strength of the complex hopping can be modified by tuning the energy separation between the Rydberg states. Different from Ref. [13] the Hamiltonian describing the system conserves the number of excitations, i.e., it has U(1) symmetry, and we here consider half filling. We study the system using numerical simulations performing exact diagonalization (ED) on small lattices with up to 30 lattice sites with periodic boundary conditions using different cluster shapes.\nIf the effects of quantum fluctuations on the complex hopping are neglected, i.e., in mean-field approximation, there is a competition between the nearest-neighbor (NN) hopping, which tries to establish a condensate of the hard-core bosons, and the next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping, driving the system into a 120\u25e6 or spiral spin phase. A transition between the two phases occurs if the strength of the mean-field secondorder hopping becomes comparable to the direct one.\nIn the full model we identify two new phases. In the vicinity of the mean-field critical point an intermediate phase emerges, which is bare of any simple spin order, has a nonvanishing spin chirality, and is characterized by a nontrivial many-body Chern number C = 1. Thus this phase is a candidate for a topological QSL. Its precise nature is, however, not completely clear and needs further investigation [35]. ED simulations for finite systems point to a gapped, nondegenerate ground state. The many-body gap does, however, vary in magnitude substantially when different twisted\nboundary conditions are applied. A gapped and nondegenerate ground state would indicate symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order. On the other hand, the Chern number of C = 1, which is robust to potential disorder, is odd and thus different from the even values found in other systems showing a symmetry-protected bosonic integer quantum Hall (BIQH) effect [24,36\u201339] and expected from general classification arguments [24]. An odd value of the Chern number would, on the other hand, be consistent with a gapless QSL. In this case the collective gap should vanish in the thermodynamic limit and the ground state should become degenerate.\nWhen the second-order hoppings have the opposite sign and become strong, another disordered spin phase emerges, which is again chiral but gapless. We believe that this phase is a candidate for a gapless chiral spin liquid but the parameter regime is outside of what can be realized in Rydberg systems.\nHard-core bosons on a honeycomb lattice with frustrated next-nearest-neighbor hopping were studied in Refs. [40,41], where the authors reported evidence for a particular type of gapless spin liquids, called a Bose metal, i.e., a QSL with a \u201cFermi-like\u201d surface in momentum space. Subsequent density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, however, showed weak density order [42], which demonstrates that an unambiguous identification of the nature of spin liquids using ED simulations is difficult.\nThe outline of this paper is as follows: In Sec. II we introduce the many-body Hamiltonian of Rydberg spin excitations in a two-dimensional honeycomb array of trapped atoms. An overview of the ground-state phases is given in Sec. III, where we show that the presence of complex and density-dependent second-order hopping processes gives rise to two disordered spin phases in addition to a trivial Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) phase and a spiral, or 120\u25e6, phase present in a meanfield Hamiltonian. We comment on the possible nature of the QSL in Sec. IV and discuss the effects of longer-range interactions in Sec. V. Finally, a summary and discussion of the results are given in Sec. VI."

            "text": "We consider a honeycomb array of microtraps filled with one atom each as shown in Fig. 1. Each site has three nearest neighbors (NNs) of the opposite sublattice and six nextnearest neighbors (NNNs) of the same sublattice A and B, respectively. As has been demonstrated in recent works [3,43\u2013 45], a deterministic and defect-free preparation of such lattice structures with characteristic separations in the micrometer scale is possible and state of the art. Each atom is excited into high-lying Rydberg states, e.g., within the 60S1/2 and 60P3/2 manifold of 87Rb as in Ref. [33]. Application of an external magnetic field perpendicular to the plane leads to a level structure where only three magnetic sublevels are relevant, indicated in Fig. 1. Two of them, here labeled as |0\u3009 and |1\u3009, form an effective spin- 12 system, and we are interested in the many-body dynamics of these spins. Dipolar coupling between the Rydberg-excited atoms leads to a hopping of spin excitations (XY coupling) with an amplitude J proportional to 1/r3, with r being the atom separation. In the case of a transition between the mJ = \u00b1 12 sublevels of S1/2 and P3/2, as\n013157-2\nmentioned above, J = d2/(8\u03c0 0r3), with d being the dipole matrix element between states |0\u3009 and |1\u3009. The third level, denoted by |+\u3009, is used to facilitate a second-order, off-resonant spin exchange process that is associated with a geometrydependent complex phase (see Fig. 1) and which depends on the spin state of the intermediate atom. The microscopic physics of the system has been studied both theoretically and experimentally in a minimal setup [33,46], and the relevant terms of the many-body Hamiltonian have been introduced and studied for a different lattice in Ref. [47]. For a detailed derivation of the Hamiltonian we thus refer to these publications. Following along the same lines as in Ref. [47], we write down the effective Hamiltonian for Rydberg excitations in the hard-core boson language (we use h\u0304 = 1):\nH\u0302 = \u2212 J \u2211 \u3008i, j\u3009 b\u0302\u2020j b\u0302i \u2212 2gJ \u2211 \u3008\u3008i, j\u3009\u3009 b\u0302\u2020j b\u0302ie \u00b1 2\u03c0 i3 (1 \u2212 n\u0302i j )\n+ 2gJ \u2211 \u3008i, j\u3009 n\u0302in\u0302 j, (1)\nwhere e\u00b1 2\u03c0 i 3 = \u2212 12 \u00b1 \u221a 3 2 i and b\u0302 \u2020 i , b\u0302i create or destroy a hardcore boson on site i, respectively. \u3008i, j\u3009 and \u3008\u3008i, j\u3009\u3009 refer to NNs and NNNs, where both i \u2192 j and j \u2192 i are included in the sum. The sign of the complex phase as well as the intermediate site of the NNN hopping terms connecting sites i and j is indicated in Fig. 1 by differently colored and bent arrows, respectively. Thus the hopping between two nearest neighbors i and j of the same sublattice is controlled by a site of the opposite sublattice, located in between the two and with particle number n\u0302i j . Note that the complex phase picked up in a closed loop around a honeycomb plaquette corresponds to exactly one flux quantum. Furthermore, in the nearestneighbor interaction term we have assumed conservation of particle number and dropped the constant energy shift\n\u2211 \u3008i, j\u3009 n\u0302i(1 \u2212 n\u0302 j ) \u2192 \u2212 \u2211 \u3008i, j\u3009 n\u0302in\u0302 j . (2)\nAll processes contained in the Hamiltonian are shown in Fig. 1. This includes (1) NN hopping with constant amplitude J which depends on the atomic level structure and the spatial separation between the atoms, (2) NNN hopping that is density dependent, possesses a staggered complex phase, and scales with an additional parameter g, and (3) NN interaction that also scales with g. Terms connecting sites further apart are smaller in magnitude and will be neglected in first approximation. We will discuss their influence at the end of the paper. In Eq. (1) the strength of the nonresonant processes g is given by g = 27J/(2 ), where denotes the detuning between two Rydberg states of the atoms. The factor 27 stems from Clebsch-Gordan coefficients and factors in the microscopic Hamiltonian (see Ref. [47]). The additional factor 12 in the definition of g is introduced to be consistent with Ref. [47], where the same atomic setup is studied on a zigzag chain. Most importantly, the magnitude and sign of g can be controlled by the detuning of the internal state |+\u3009. In order to be able to neglect the population of the off-resonant state, the detuning cannot be too small, i.e., J/| | 1, but values of |g| \u223c 2 are possible. In this paper we consider half filling of hard-core bosons corresponding to a vanishing total magnetization.\nLet us first discuss some general aspects of Hamiltonian (1). The presence of complex hopping amplitudes means that time-reversal symmetry is explicitly broken. The microscopic origin of this is the magnetic field used to select the specific sublevels of the Rydberg atoms. Secondly, without the nonlinear term in the NNN hopping the model is symmetric under a combined time-reversal and particle-hole transformation at half filling, but this symmetry is broken by the term (1 \u2212 n\u0302i j ). The NN density-density interaction corresponding to a ferromagnetic (gJ < 0) or antiferromagnetic (gJ > 0) Ising term would drive the system into a density-ordered state. The NNN hopping which is of the same strength, however, prevents the formation of a state with ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic density order. Therefore the possible phases are essentially governed by the competition of the NN and NNN hopping terms and the action of the nonlinear term in the NNN hopping amplitude."

Using the Lanczos algorithm [48], we gain access to the ground-state wave function.\nTo obtain a general overview of the phase diagram as a function of the parameter g, we consider the change in the ground-state wave function | 0\u3009 upon infinitesimal changes in g. We can quantify this by the dimensionless, intensive fidelity metric\nf (g) = 2 L 1 \u2212 |\u3008 0(g)| | 0(g + \u03b4g)\u3009| (\u03b4g)2 , \u03b4g \u2192 0.

            "text": "To gain some insight into the main competing terms in the Hamiltonian, we first study a mean-field approximation. To this end, we drop the nearest-neighbor interaction term and replace the density dependence of the NNN hopping term with a constant expectation value\n(1 \u2212 n\u0302i j ) \u2192 (1 \u2212 n\u0304). (4) Here, n\u0304 denotes the average density of the lattice. Since we consider half filling, we set n\u0304 = 0.5.

(5)\nThis mean-field Hamiltonian is that of the Bose-Hubbard Haldane model. The corresponding single-particle band structure is that of Haldane\u2019s generalization of graphene in the topologically nontrivial regime [52]. However, as shown in Ref. [53], the hard-core boson character of the Rydberg excitations makes the many-body ground state topologically trivial. Note that while in one dimension hard-core bosons and fermions can behave identically under certain circumstances, this is decidedly not the case in two dimensions, and the generalization of the Wigner-Jordan transformation to two dimensions requires the introduction of effective gauge fields [54]. In Fig. 3 we have plotted the fidelity metric of the ground state as a function of the interaction strength g, using the mean-field Hamiltonian (5) with periodic boundary conditions (PBCs) on a torus. From the fidelity we see two regimes separated by a single peak. The left region is continuously connected to the trivial limit g = 0, where the system is in a BEC state. In order to understand the phase in the right region, it is sufficient to consider the case g 1, where the NN hopping term is\nirrelevant:\nH\u0302g\u2192\u221e = \u2212gJ \u2211 \u3008\u3008i, j\u3009\u3009 b\u0302\u2020j b\u0302ie \u00b1 2\u03c03 i. (6)\nNow, the two triangular sublattices A and B of the hexagonal lattice are disconnected, and the internal dynamics in each of the sublattices is determined by the NNN hopping. Furthermore, we can rewrite the Hamiltonian in terms of spin- 12 matrices\nb\u0302\u2020 \u2192 S\u0302+ = S\u0302x + iS\u0302y, b\u0302 \u2192 S\u0302\u2212 = S\u0302x \u2212 iS\u0302y, (7) such that the NNN hopping term reads\nH\u0302g\u2192\u221e = \u2212 gJ 2\n\u2211 ( ST ,1DS ,2 + ST ,2DS ,3 + ST ,3DS ,1 ) .\n(8)\nHere, the vector operators S ,i are projections of the spins to the xy plane, the index runs over all triangles of both triangular sublattices, and the index 1,2,3 iterates through a single triangle as indicated in the inset of Fig. 3. The matrix D = D(2\u03c0/3) is the rotational matrix around the z axis with rotation angle of 2\u03c0/3. With D3 = 1 we can write H\u0302g\u2192\u221e in its final form:\nH\u0302g\u2192\u221e = \u2212gJ 2\n\u2211\n(S + DS ,2 + D2S ,3)2 + const. (9)\nFor g > 0 we see that in the ground state the rotated spins S ,1, DS ,2, and D2S ,3 need to be parallel, i.e., the spin vectors themselves have to be at an angle of 120\u25e6 in the xy plane. We can confirm this calculation by considering the in-plane spin correlations, which we define as C(\u03b8 ) = 4\u2329S\u0302(0)i S\u0302(\u03b8 )j \u232a, (10) where\nS\u0302(\u03b8 )j = cos(\u03b8 )S\u0302xj + sin(\u03b8 )S\u0302yj . (11) This correlation function detects whether both spin vectors are separated by an angle \u03b8 in the equatorial plane. The factor of 4 is introduced to normalize C(\u03b8 ) to unity in the case of a perfectly correlated state.\nIn Fig. 4 we show the results for the in-plane spin correlations in the mean-field limit, which show a maximum at \u03b8 = 120\u25e6 for large g. The case of g < 0 can be understood similarly: Here, the sum over the rotated spin vectors has to vanish, which requires the spins to align in a parallel way in the xy plane. The \u03b8 = 120\u25e6 phase has a remaining SO(2) symmetry. The lack of any correlation between NNs in the 120\u25e6 phase for large g is a trivial result of the disconnected sublattices in this limit. The small deviation of C(120\u25e6) from the maximum value of 12 [taking into account the SO(2) symmetry] can be attributed to finite-size effects."

In order to minimize the impact of finite-size effects, it is useful to impose a more general type of boundary conditions. Specifically, we consider twisted boundary conditions, where a particle picks up a phase upon hopping over the boundary. Therefore we average S(k) over all low-energy configurations with twisted boundary conditions (see Sec. III B 3 c).\nIn Fig. 8 we show the results for the spin order, Eq. (13), for L = 24 (shape 24C). In the BEC regime (g = 0) the plot shows a single prominent peak around zero momentum, consistent with parallel spins in the xy plane as discussed before.\nThe 120\u25e6 order occurs for g > 1 such that NNN hopping terms and the density-density repulsion are dominant, whereas NN hopping is weak. Consequently, we can imagine the honeycomb lattice as two separate triangular sublattices. In this limit, the nearest-neighbor spin orientation in the xy plane is completely uncorrelated, while NNNs align themselves at an angle of 2\u03c03 = 120\u25e6. This is demonstrated in the hexagonal peaks of Fig. 8(d), which are a well-known indicator of 120\u25e6 order [56] (also referred to as spiral order). Additionally, as we have seen already in Fig. 6, we find that the in-plane spin correlation (10) vanishes for spins of different sublattices and prefers the angle 2\u03c0/3 for the same sublattice.\nb. Dimerization. In order to test for the presence of more involved orderings, we investigate whether a regular pattern of dimerized spins occurs in the system.

The results of the calculation are shown in Fig. 9, where we observe only short-ranged correlations.\nc. Randomly twisted boundary conditions. A rather general method to distinguish ordered from disordered phases in a quantum system is to study the reaction of the ground state to changes in boundary conditions. Therefore we investigate the low-energy states of the model using randomly twisted boundary conditions (RTBCs), following ideas introduced in Ref. [58]. Specifically, we study how changes by randomly twisting the boundary conditions affect the ground state. The twisting is performed by adding a complex phase to the hopping terms that cross a boundary in the horizontal or vertical direction. A hard-core boson crossing the boundary in the x direction then acquires a phase \u03b8x, for a vertical hop across\n013157-6\nthe boundary it picks up a phase \u03b8y, and it picks up the sum or difference \u03b8x \u00b1 \u03b8y in the case of a diagonal crossing.\nFor each realization, the phases (\u03b8x, \u03b8y) are drawn at random from the uniformly distributed interval [0, 2\u03c0 ). For further reference we will use P to denote the set of realizations, where {\n\u03b8 (p)x , \u03b8 (p) y } \u2208 P, \u2200 0 p M, (15) and M represents the number of realizations. Depending on the particular boundary condition in one realization, the ground-state energy E (\u03b8 (p)x , \u03b8 (p) y ) and the ground-state vector | (\u03b8 (p)x , \u03b8 (p)y )\u3009 will vary, some realizations resulting in higher or lower ground-state energies. Therefore we define the optimal twist (\u03b8gsx , \u03b8 gs y ) to be that realization which results in the minimal ground-state energy\nE ( \u03b8gsx , \u03b8 gs y ) \u2261 min p\u2208P { E ( \u03b8 (p)x , \u03b8 (p) y )} . (16)\nAccordingly, we will refer to | (\u03b8gsx , \u03b8gsy )\u3009 as the optimal ground-state vector and to E (\u03b8gsx , \u03b8 gs y ) as the optimal groundstate energy. Then, we can normalize all energies E (\u03b8 (p)x , \u03b8 (p) y ) with respect to the optimal ground-state energy and compute the relative difference\np = E\n( \u03b8 (p) x , \u03b8 (p) y ) \u2212 E(\u03b8gsx , \u03b8gsy )\u2223\u2223E(\u03b8gsx , \u03b8gsy )\u2223\u2223 > 0, (17) as well as the overlap of each ground state with the optimal ground state\nOp = \u2223\u2223\u2329 (\u03b8 (p)x , \u03b8 (p)y )\u2223\u2223 \u2223\u2223 (\u03b8gsx , \u03b8gsy )\u232a\u2223\u2223. (18)\nAs the authors explain in Ref. [56], the distribution of Op over p for a set of ground-state vectors (all relevant parameters of the Hamiltonian remaining the same) depends strongly on whether a quantum phase is ordered or disordered. For an ordered phase, there exists a definitive boundary condition which accommodates the order intrinsic to the ground state of an infinite system, whereas all other boundary conditions prohibit it. An antiferromagnetic spin- 12 chain in 1D is a simple example. Here, if the number of sites in the system is odd, the antiferromagnetic order is prevented if no twisted boundary conditions are in place. Including TBCs, \u03b8 = \u03c0 is uniquely suited to minimize the ground-state energy as it accommodates the order of the system. As \u03b8 is altered from its optimal value of \u03c0 , the ground-state energy increases. Therefore we expect only very few ground states of similar energy to the optimal ground-state energy for an ordered phase. In the disordered case, however, many different boundary conditions lead to very similar ground-state energies, including states that have very little overlap with the optimal ground state. To quantify this distribution, we define the set of configurations with energy comparable to the optimal ground state Q = {(\u03b8 (p)x , \u03b8 (p)y ) \u2208 P : p < \u03b1}, (19) where \u03b1 is chosen to be sufficiently small, e.g., \u03b1 = 0.01. Subsequently, we define the fraction of low-energy configurations to be\nNc = |Q| M . (20)\nContinuing the argument from before, Nc is typically small for ordered phases and close to unity for disordered ones. This characterization is somewhat dependent on the particular choice of \u03b1, which also depends on the system size L. For our case of L = 24 (we use the shape 24C shown in Fig. 2) the choice of \u03b1 = 0.01 is reasonable (see Ref. [56]).\nIn Fig. 10 we show the results of the RTBC calculations for shape 24C, having performed M = 200 realizations of twisting angles for each value of g that we consider. In Fig. 10(d), not all points are visible since we limit the p axis to 0.05. Judging by the values of Nc for each g, we find a clearly disordered regime for g = \u22125 (regime I in Fig. 5), with a strongly ordered phase at g = 4 (120\u25e6 order). The RTBC results at value g = 0.73, i.e., in phase II, are in between the clearly disordered situation shown in Fig. 10(a) and the BEC phase, shown in Fig. 10(b), and a clear identification as an ordered or disordered phase is not easy. We will show, however, in Sec. III C that the situation becomes much clearer if the competing effects from the repulsive density-density interaction are switched off."

Therefore we now investigate the spin gap and the collective gap.\nIn a hard-core boson representation the spin gap corresponds to the change in the energy per particle when adding or subtracting a boson. Thus we calculate the chemical potential as the discrete first derivative of the many-body energy with\n013157-8\nregard to the particle number N . The result for the disordered regimes I and II can be seen in Fig. 14(a). For the small systems that we are able to analyze numerically with exact diagonalization, the clear identification of a spin gap is masked by finite-size effects. Nevertheless, while in phase I the spin gap clearly vanishes [see Fig. 14(a)], the curve for phase II is indicative of a finite spin gap.\nSecondly, we investigate the collective gap, which is shown in Fig. 14(b) for the parameter regimes of the BEC and phase I and in Fig. 14(c) for phase II. We plot the energy gap to the first excited state in the mean-field Hamiltonian (red symbols), the full Hamiltonian (blue symbols), and the Hamiltonian without density-density interaction terms (green symbols) for cluster shape 24C. We have also calculated the collective gap for a few values of g in clusters up to size 30 but could not make a reliable finite-size scaling. Phase I is clearly gapless, while for phase II we observe that the excitation gap is increased by the nonlinear hopping as compared with the mean-field case, and, as expected, the density-density interaction leads to an additional enhancement. This is indicative of a gapped phase II and thus a nondegenerate ground state on a torus.\nThe absence of degeneracy in the topological nontrivial regime would point to a symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phase. Our model has a U(1) symmetry associated with particle-number conservation. There is a full classification of SPT phases [25], and for bosons in d = 2 spatial dimensions with U(1) symmetry, different phases characterized by a Zquantized topological invariant exist, corresponding to the H1+d [U(1), U(1)] cohomology group [25]. We note, however, that our finding of an odd-valued Chern number is different from the Chern numbers C = \u00b12 of the bosonic integer quantum Hall (BIQH) effect found, e.g., in Ref. [38] for bosons on a honeycomb lattice with NN and (different) densitydependent NNN hopping at unit filling and in Ref. [37] or Ref. [39] for bosons with internal degrees of freedom. The odd value of C is also different from what would be expected from the classification of interacting integer topological phases put forward in Ref. [24].\nWe are not able to perform a proper finite-size scaling using ED simulations, and for the unambiguous verification\nof the gapfulness of phase II, more sophisticated methods are needed. Corresponding investigations using DMRG and a tensor network approach are underway and will be reported elsewhere [35]. In particular, for a Dirac QSL it is difficult to verify the gaplessness of the system, but the dependence of the collective gap on twisting angles is a signature of such a gapless spin liquid [59]. In Fig. 15 we have therefore analyzed the size of the gap for different twists of the boundary conditions. While the gap remains always finite, it shows a strong dependence."

A mapping from hard-core bosons to spinless fermions can be achieved in one dimension by a Jordan-Wigner transformation [60]. In two dimensions, this is accomplished via a Chern-Simons (CS) transformation, whose lattice version [61] reads\nb\u0302i = c\u0302i ei \u2211 j =i arg (zi\u2212z j )n\u0302 j , (26)\n013157-9\nwhere b\u0302 j are hard-core boson operators and c\u0302 j are fermion operators.

It is instructive to decompose this field into a meanfield part and a fluctuation part B\u0302 ji = \u3008B\u0302 ji\u3009 + \u03b4B\u0302 ji, where \u03b4B\u0302 ji = \u2211 l = j,i \u03b4B\u0302 (l ) ji and\n\u03b4B\u0302(l )ji = [arg(zi \u2212 zl ) \u2212 arg(z j \u2212 zl )](n\u0302l \u2212 \u3008n\u0302l\u3009). (29) The mean-field term can easily be evaluated for an infinite hexagonal lattice at half filling, where \u3008n\u0302 j\u3009 = 0.5. One finds that \u3008B\u0302 ji\u3009 is to good approximation a multiple of 2\u03c0 for the NN hopping terms and may be disregarded, while for the NNN hoppings it just compensates the terms \u00b12\u03c0/3 to within a few percent.

We thus conclude that here the fluctuation CS field \u03b4B\u0302 ji can most likely be neglected. In the full model, however, the projector (1 \u2212 n\u0302i j ) generates an additional mean-field contribution resulting from the site in between the next-nearest neighbors i and j.

(31)\nAssuming that all other contributions to the fluctuation CS field \u03b4B\u0302(l )ji are small and can be ignored, we recognize that the nonlinearity of the NNN hopping effectively generates a nonvanishing flux for the fermions, which therefore enter a topologically nontrivial phase of the Haldane model with Chern number C = 1.

            "text": "Despite numerous experimental indications, the realization and verification of a quantum spin liquid phase in solidstate systems remain a major challenge. In this paper we have proposed a model system accessible in cold-gas experiments with Rydberg atoms where such a state could be realized and studied in extended parameter regimes. Motivated by the recent experimental observation of nonlinear, complex hopping processes of Rydberg spin excitations in two-dimensional arrays of trapped atoms, we analyzed the many-body ground state of these excitations in a honeycomb lattice at half filling using exact diagonalization simulations. The density-dependent complex hopping as well as a nearest-\n013157-10\nneighbor density-density interaction arise from second-order processes of excitations between two Rydberg levels, whose strength can be controlled by tuning the energy of a third, off-resonant Rydberg state. If the nonlinear hopping is treated in mean-field approximation, the model is equivalent to the Haldane model in the topologically nontrivial phase with additional nearest-neighbor interactions. Since the elementary constituents are here spin- 12 particles or, equivalently, hardcore bosons rather than fermions, the mean-field model has, however, no topological ground state. It instead possesses only two trivial phases, a condensate (BEC) with a preferred occupation of modes with wave vectors close to zero, as well as a 120\u25e6 phase with spiral spin order and a remaining SO(2) rotational symmetry. A phase transition between the two phases occurs when the direct hopping is similar in amplitude to the second-order, next-nearest-neighbor hopping. In the full model an additional phase, denoted as phase II, emerges close to the mean-field critical point, and there are indications of a transition or a crossover into another phase for very large second-order hoppings of opposite sign. The latter regime is, however, outside the range of validity of the effective manybody Hamiltonian for the Rydberg system. We verified the absence of simple spin or dimer order in the new phases, and considering randomly twisted boundary conditions, we found strong evidence that both phases are disordered. This becomes particularly evident if the density-density interaction, which competes with the hopping processes and drives the system towards density order, is switched off. Since the complex, nonlinear hopping breaks both time-reversal and chiral symmetry, the spins can have a nonvanishing spin chirality, which attains a very large value in both new phases. We calculated the many-body Chern number and found a value C = 1 to within numerical precision in phase II, which was also shown to be robust against potential disorder, and C = 0 in the BEC and 120\u25e6 phases. Furthermore, we calculated the spin and collective gaps using ED simulations on finite lattices with periodic boundary conditions. Since for the system sizes that can be reached with exact diagonalization it is not possible to make reliable extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit, we cannot draw definite conclusions here. While the ED\nresults clearly point to a gapless phase I, we found indications for a finite spin gap and a finite collective gap in phase II, which was shown to originate from the nonlinear hopping rather than from the density-density interaction. This would point to a symmetry-protected topological phase protected by the U(1) symmetry. Considering a mapping of the hard-core boson Hamiltonian to spinless fermions coupled to a ChernSimons field, we showed that the topologically nontrivial phase is caused by the density dependence of the NNN hopping. The nonlinearity of this hopping generates an additional Chern-Simons flux for the fermion model, which becomes topologically nontrivial due to this. The odd value C = 1 of the Chern number is, however, in contrast to several bosonic integer quantum Hall phases found in Refs. [37\u201339] and predicted from the general classification scheme of Ref. [24]. Calculating the collective gap in phase II for different twisted boundary conditions, we found a nonzero, but strongly varying value, which rather points to a gapless Dirac QSL, which is even more pronounced if the density-density interaction is switched off. Thus while there is strong evidence that phase II is a topological quantum spin liquid at half filling, its true nature remains unclear and requires further investigation.\nNote added. Recently, we became aware of a publication [62] predicting a fractional quantum Hall phase for a similar system with average particle density 14 induced by densitydensity interactions in engineered flat Chern bands."
