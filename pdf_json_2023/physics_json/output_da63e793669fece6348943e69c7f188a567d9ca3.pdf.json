    "abstractText": "Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus are the primary bacteria that cause clinical infections, such as urinary and intestinal infections, pneumonia, endocarditis, and sepsis. Bacterial resistance is an innate natural occurrence in microorganisms, resulting from mutations or the lateral exchange of genetic material. This serves as evidence for the association between drug consumption and pathogen resistance. Evidence has demonstrated that the association between conventional antibiotics and natural products is a promising pharmacological strategy to overcome resistance mechanisms. Considering the large body of research demonstrating the significant antimicrobial activities of Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi, the present study aimed to evaluate the chemical composition and antibiotic-enhancing effects of Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi essential oil (STEO) against the standard and multidrug-resistant strains of Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus. The STEO was extracted by hydrodistillation using a Clevenger-type vacuum rotary evaporator. The Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) of the STEO was assessed by the microdilution method to evaluate the antibacterial activity. The antibiotic-enhancing activity of the essential oil was assessed by determining the MIC of antibiotics in the presence of a sub-inhibitory concentration (MIC/8) of the natural product. The GC-MS analysis revealed alpha-pinene (24.3%), gamma-muurolene (16.6%), and myrcene (13.7%) as major constituents of the STEO. The STEO potentiated the enhanced antibacterial activity of norfloxacin and gentamicin against all the strains and increased the action of penicillin against the Gram-negative strains. Therefore, it is concluded that although the STEO does not exhibit clinically effective antibacterial activity, its association with conventional antibiotics results in enhanced antibiotic activity.",

            "text": "The discovery of antibiotics and their use against bacterial infections represented one of the most relevant therapeutic advances in the 20th century, significantly contributing\nPlants 2023, 12, 1587. https://doi.org/10.3390/plants12081587 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/plants\nto the increase in life expectancy and the rise of modern medicine [1\u20133]. However, the indiscriminate use and inappropriate prescription of antibiotics have contributed to the development of bacterial resistance [4,5], limiting the effectiveness of the currently available drugs, including last-generation antibiotics. The rapid escalation of bacteria that are immune to antibiotics has resulted in widespread concern within the global health community. These recurrent infections pose a significant challenge due to their difficulty to manage since they require expensive and toxic antibiotics that are hard to obtain. This situation has an impact on public health, ecology, and the economy. Recent research has indicated that over 2 million individuals in the United States are infected with antibiotic-resistant bacteria, leading to 23,000 deaths annually [6]. Bacterial resistance is a phenomenon that has been occurring frequently, resulting from mutations or the lateral exchange of genetic material. This serves as evidence for the association between drug consumption and pathogen resistance. A group of genes called \u201cbacterial resistome\u201d orchestrates the resistance profile. It is categorized as intrinsic resistance, which pertains to a collection of organisms that become resistant to certain antibiotics without receiving genetic material and could be obtained via mutations [7]. Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Staphylococcus aureus are the primary bacteria that cause clinical infections, such as urinary and intestinal infections, pneumonia, endocarditis, and sepsis. Escherichia coli is one of the main bacteria that cause infectious diseases in humans. It is known by the production of enterotoxins, whose properties have been widely investigated. Its transmission can occur through ingesting contaminated food and water and has the human being as a secondary dissemination vehicle. It is also worth mentioning that pathogenic E. coli has some serotypes, which are determined based on pathogenicity, virulence, and the damage they can cause. Its transmission can occur through the ingestion of contaminated food and water and has the human being as a secondary dissemination vehicle. Eminent for being considered the cause of high morbidity and mortality rates, E. coli is not just a harmless commensal present in the intestinal tract since some types of harmful E. coli can cause a series of complications in the organism. Among these complications, diarrhea, dysentery, gastroenteritis, urinary tract infection, and meningitis are highlighted [8]. Pseudomonas aeruginosa is responsible for various infections affecting the skin, eyes, and ears. The broad distribution environment of Pseudomonas strains and the significant variety of enzymes and toxins that potentiate their virulence ensure their growth and transmission, commonly associated with burns and hospital infections in neonatal intensive care units. In immunocompromised patients, such as people with cystic fibrosis and advanced-stage HIV infections, there is a considerable risk of community-acquired contamination. This bacterium can fall into the category of multidrug-resistant (MDR), which means it is not susceptible to at least one agent in three or more antimicrobial categories. It can also be categorized as extensively resistant (XDR), meaning it is not susceptible to at least one agent in all but two or fewer antimicrobial categories, leaving only one or two categories in which the bacterial isolates remain susceptible. If the bacterial isolate is non-susceptible to all agents in all antimicrobial categories, it is categorized as pan-resistant (PDR), indicating that no agents tested are susceptible to that organism. Therefore, a bacterial isolate that is characterized as XDR is also characterized as MDR. Similarly, a bacterial isolate must be XDR to be classified as PDR [9]. Staphylococcus aureus is a significant causative agent of human and nosocomial infections. In addition to causing different types of poisoning, S. aureus is the most common etiological agent of purulent infections (e.g., boil, carbuncle, abscess, myocarditis, endocarditis, pneumonia, meningitis, arthritis bacterial). The transmission of this pathogen can result from the ingestion of contaminated water and food, either due to carelessness in handling it or inadequate refrigeration and cooking. When growing in environments with favorable development conditions, this microorganism produces toxins, such as enterotoxin, a substance that causes food poisoning. Moreover, S. aureus is an important\ncause of intestinal infections, folliculitis, puerperal mastitis, and boils, in addition to severe infections such as sepsis, septic shock, endocarditis, and pneumonia [7]. One of the main public health problems with S. aureus, in addition to its virulence, is its resistance. We emphasize the MRSA strains (methicillin-resistant S. aureus), are strains of this bacterium which have acquired resistance to methicillin and other beta-lactam antibiotics. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), MRSA is a major cause of healthcare-associated infections, and its prevalence is increasing worldwide [10]. Studies have shown that the emergence and spread of MRSA are associated with various risk factors, including prolonged hospitalization, invasive medical procedures, and exposure to antibiotics. Studies have shown that the emergence and spread of MRSA are associated with various risk factors, including prolonged hospitalization, invasive medical procedures, and exposure to antibiotics. In addition, MRSA can spread rapidly within healthcare settings, posing a significant threat to vulnerable patient populations. To address this issue, healthcare facilities must implement effective infection control measures, such as hand hygiene, environmental cleaning, and surveillance of MRSA [11]. Worryingly, many of these strains have developed multidrug resistance and are associated with high morbidity and mortality rates [12\u201315], which points to the urgent need to discover new antibacterial drugs capable of overcoming the antibiotic-resistance mechanism developed by these strains. In this context, consistent evidence presents the bioprospecting of natural products as a promising alternative in the identification of bioactive compounds [16,17], extracts, and essential oils with the potential to be used in the development of new drugs for treating various diseases, including those caused by bacterial infections [18,19]. The utilization of plants for medicinal purposes is a longstanding tradition that has been transmitted through generations based on empirical knowledge. The medicinal properties of plants are attributed to the secondary metabolites, or phytochemicals, that they contain. These compounds not only provide therapeutic benefits but also protect the plants from pests and microbial infections [20]. The combination of antibiotics with nonantibiotic compounds is found to be a promising strategy in the combat of bacterial infections. Several studies have demonstrated the possibility of combining antibiotics with adjuvants or antimicrobial compounds, such as bioactive secondary metabolites of plants, also known as phytochemicals. Accordingly, evidence indicates that the essential oil substances are a group of phytochemicals with promising antibiotic-potentiating activity, as demonstrated by several in vitro studies [21]. Essential oils (EOs) are a blend of volatile compounds synthesized by aromatic plants that contain secondary metabolites. Therefore, essential oils are composed of secondary metabolites from plants. They serve a crucial function in safeguarding the plants from predators, microorganisms, and unfavorable weather conditions. The chemical structures of EOs are diverse and consist of various groups with distinct biosynthetic origins, including: 1-terpenes (monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes); 2-terpenoids (isoprenoids); 3-group with chemical characteristics of aliphatic; and 4-group with chemical characteristics of aromatic compounds (e.g., aldehydes, phenols). All of these groups are characterized by their low molecular weight. Monoterpenes are the primary components of EOs, and they have been found to exhibit potent antibacterial activity against microorganisms related to dental caries [22]. Essential oils have constituents, primarily terpenes, that can interact synergistically with antibiotics, enhancing their antibacterial effects. The phytochemical components of essential oils appear to facilitate the transport various compounds in the medium into the interior of the bacteria, thereby improving the antibacterial activity of drugs which acquire greater penetration capacity in the bacterial cell [23]. When antibacterials are combined with essential oils, their interaction can produce three possible results: synergistic, additive, or antagonistic. Synergy occurs when two antibacterial substances are combined, producing antibacterial activity that is greater than the summation of the antibacterial activity of each substance alone. An additive effect is produced when antibacterials are combined, resulting in an antibacterial effect that is the same the sum of the\nindividual substances. Conversely, an antagonistic effect decreases the antibacterial activity of the two substances in combination compared to their individual antibacterial activity [24]. Essential oils have already demonstrated promising synergistic activity [25]. It appears that phytochemical found in essential oils favors the transportation of compounds to the interior bacteria, thereby improving the antibacterial efficacy of many drugs [20]. The Anacardiaceae family stands out for the considerable number of botanical species with medicinal properties [26\u201328]. Among these species, the plant Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi, commonly known in Brazil as \u201caroeira vermelha\u201d, \u201caroeira mansa\u201d, and \u201cpimenta rosa\u201d stands out, and is perceived in the Cerrado, Caatinga, Atlantic Forest and Pampas biomes. This species has a variety of applications, being used in folk medicine, in the ornamentation of large urban centers, and even for food purposes. In traditional medicine, it is used to prepare teas, baths, soaps, balms, and ointments. Therefore, it can be used to treat respiratory infections, fever, rheumatism, muscle, and intestinal problems, among other purposes. In this regard, phytochemical studies with the species have revealed that its constituents may have a bioactive action since these studies indicate the presence of phenols, flavonoids, steroids, triterpenes, anthraquinones, and saponins. Previous studies have shown that this species has anti-inflammatory, antimicrobial, anti-rheumatic, and healing activities [29,30]. Therefore, to expand scientific knowledge of the biological activities of Schinus terebinthifolius and to increase its possibility of becoming a potential herbal medicine, new studies are needed on its chemical characteristics, combined with detailed studies of its potential biological activities, with emphasis on antimicrobial activities. Therefore, the present study aimed to evaluate the chemical composition and antibacterial activity of Schinus terebinthifolius Raddi essential oil (STEO) against standard and multidrug resistant (MDR) bacterial strains."

The antibacterial activity of any essential oil depends on the relative abundance of biologically active constituents in the entire oil. However, the abundance of the main active constituents in essential oils is one of many factors responsible for their inherent activity since the interactions between these and minor constituents are also critical. In this context, previous research has demonstrated that combining eugenol with linalool or menthol exhibited significant synergism, suggesting that monoterpenoid alcohol is effective in potentiating their biological effects [32]. Testing of compounds or fractions of essential oils in combinations of two or four components has resulted in the identification of several synergistic antimicrobial activities [31]. The mechanism of action for antimicrobials varies depending on the type of essential oil (EO) and microbial strain. It is well known that Gram-positive bacteria are more susceptible to EOs than Gram-negative bacteria [25]. This can be attributed to the fact that Gram-negative bacteria have a rigid outer membrane which has a large amount of lipopolysaccharides (LPS). This membrane is more complex decreases diffusion of hydrophobic compounds through the plasma membrane. Conversely, Gram-positive bacteria are surrounded by a thick peptidoglycan wall with insufficient density to prevent the passage of small molecules, allowing for easier access to the cell interior [33,34]. Furthermore, the hydrophobic portions of lipoteichoic acid located within the cell membrane of Gram-positive bacteria could potentially aid in the penetration of hydropho-\nbic constituents found in essential oils [35]. Therefore, essential oils can break the plasma membrane and the cell wall, increasing the penetrability in bacterial cell, causing the leakage of cytosol components, especially losses of electrolytes such as K+, Ca2+, Na+, and also losses of sugars and other molecules such as proteins and nucleic acids [36]. However, the present study failed to show direct antibacterial activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. When antibiotics were associated with essential oil, the effects were more significant against Gram-positive bacteria using antibiotics that act directly inside the cell. It is suggested that the membrane alteration allows the penetration of greater antibiotic doses inside the bacterial cell. The results of the present study are corroborated by the findings of Uliana [37]. They identified 32 chemical constituents in the essential oil of S. terebentifolius leaves, including myrcene (6.78%) and alpha-pinene (4.05%) as significant constituents. Ennigrou et al. [38] studied the chemical composition of the essential oil of the leaves and branches of S. terebinthifolius, demonstrating the predominance of alpha-phellandrene (33.06\u201336.18%), alpha-pinene (14.85\u201315.18%), and limonene (6.62\u20138.79%) in leaves and branches, respectively. The results obtained in the present study showed that STEO did not present significant antibacterial activity against the standard and multidrug-resistant strains of E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus since this essential oil presented Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) values \u22651024 \u00b5g/mL. A MIC of this magnitude is considered irrelevant for clinical application since a high product concentration is required to perform direct antibacterial activity, implying a higher toxicity index [39]. On the other hand, a study by Cole et al. [40] evaluated the antibacterial activity of the essential oil of the ripe fruit of S. terebinthifolius against wild strains of hospital origin, including E. coli, P. aeruginosa, and S. aureus, demonstrating significant activity against all the strains, especially against the Gram-positives. Similarly, Salem et al. [41] explained that essential oil from ripe fruits of S. terebinthifolius has antibacterial activity against S. aureus and P. aeruginosa. Furthermore, Gundidza and collaborators [42] showed that essential oil obtained from fresh leaves of the same species showed activity against Gram-negative bacteria E. coli and P. aeruginosa. Other species of the genus Schinus have also had their antibacterial properties previously demonstrated. In this perspective, El-Nashar et al. [43] verified the antibacterial activity of oil from leaves and bark of Schinus polygamus (Anacardiaceae) against E. coli ATCC 25922, P. aeruginosa ATCC 10145, S. aureus ATCC 33591, and two clinical isolates of this species. These authors demonstrated that while the leaf oil showed inhibitory action against all bacterial strains, the bark oil was effective only against E. coli ATCC 25922 and P. aeruginosa ATCC 10145. On the other hand, the essential oil did not affect the resistance profile to the penicillin action observed in the tests with S. aureus. In this case, the resistance mechanism involves the production of penicillinases, which promotes the hydrolysis of the beta-lactam ring of penicillin, which causes its inactivation [44]. The pharmacological action demonstrated by STEO in the present study may be mediated by constituents such as alpha-pinene since previous studies have shown that this compound acts as a potentiator of the action of antibiotics. In addition, another significant component of the essential oil, alpha-pinene, potentiated the activity of norfloxacin against strains of S. aureus [24,45], E. coli, and P. aeruginosa [45], corroborating the findings of this study."

In total, three extraction cycles were performed, using 1 L of water for every 50 g of dry leaves, with an overall extraction time of 150 min. To determine the yield of the essential oil, the dry weight of the botanical material used in the extraction was compared to the total mass of essential oil obtained on a dry basis. The chemical composition of the oil was analyzed using Gas Chromatography coupled with Mass Spectroscopy. Identification of chemical constituents was based on the comparison of their mass spectra with the Wiley and NIST library, as well as the analysis of linear retention indices. These indices were calculated by injecting a homologous series of hydrocarbons (C7\u2013C26) and compared to previously published data. Only peaks with a concentration greater than 1% were considered for the identification and quantification of chemical components. The mass detector was operated in electron ionization mode (70 eV) at a scan rate of 3.15 min\u22121 and a mass range of 40\u2013450 u, while the transfer line, ion source, and quadrupole analyzer were maintained at 260 \u25e6C, 230 \u25e6C, and 150 \u25e6C, respectively.
