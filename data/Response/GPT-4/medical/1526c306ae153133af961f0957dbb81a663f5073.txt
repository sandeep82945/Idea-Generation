Improvement of Erectile Function Post-Prostatectomy: Considering the difficulty in preserving erectile function as highlighted in the study, future research could focus on innovative surgical techniques, nerve-sparing methods, or postoperative rehabilitation programs specifically designed to enhance the recovery of erectile function without compromising oncological outcomes. Comparative studies on different nerve-sparing techniques and their long-term impact on erectile function could provide valuable insights.

Enhanced Criteria for Active Surveillance: Given the increasing diagnosis of prostate cancer in younger men and the risks associated with overtreatment, there's a need for more refined criteria for selecting patients for active surveillance. Research could focus on integrating genetic, molecular, and imaging markers to better stratify patients according to their risk and reduce the likelihood of unnecessary treatments while closely monitoring those who might benefit from early intervention.

Development of Non-Invasive or Minimally Invasive Treatments: Exploring the effectiveness and quality of life outcomes of non-invasive or minimally invasive treatments for prostate cancer could be beneficial. Studies comparing these methods with traditional surgical approaches, in terms of oncological outcomes, quality of life, and recovery time, might provide new insights into patient-centered care.

Psychological and Social Support Systems for Postoperative Recovery: Recognizing the impact of prostate cancer treatment on patients' quality of life, research could delve into the design and evaluation of comprehensive psychological and social support systems. These systems could assist patients in navigating the emotional, social, and physical challenges post-treatment, focusing on areas such as sexual health, continence, and the psychological impact of cancer diagnosis and treatment.

Long-term Outcomes of Pentafecta Achievement: Investigating the long-term outcomes and quality of life of patients who achieve pentafecta compared to those who do not could provide valuable insights for clinical practice. This research could include longitudinal studies tracking patients over several years to assess the durability of treatment benefits, the incidence of late complications, and the overall impact on life satisfaction and mental health.
