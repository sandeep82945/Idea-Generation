Regional Comparison and Spatial Econometric Analysis of Low-Carbon Tourism: Given the observed regional differences in the development of low-carbon tourism within the YRB, a future study could apply spatial econometric analysis to understand the spatial distribution and influencing factors of low-carbon tourism development. This research could compare different regions within China or globally, to identify best practices and policies that effectively promote low-carbon tourism.

Impact of Renewable Energy Adoption in the Tourism Industry on Carbon Emissions: Building on the findings related to energy consumption and its impact on tourism-related carbon emissions, a study could specifically focus on the role of renewable energy adoption within the tourism sector. This research could assess how shifts from traditional energy sources to renewables (e.g., solar, wind) in tourism facilities and transport can reduce carbon emissions and enhance sustainability.

Longitudinal Study on the Effect of COVID-19 on Low-Carbon Tourism Development: Considering the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the tourism industry, a longitudinal study could explore the long-term effects of the pandemic on low-carbon tourism development strategies. This research would examine changes in tourist behaviors, energy consumption patterns, and the adoption of digital technologies in tourism operations post-pandemic.

Development and Validation of a Comprehensive Indicator for Low-Carbon Tourism: The paper highlights the lack of a comprehensive indicator to compare the development level of low-carbon tourism across different years or regions. Future research could focus on developing, validating, and applying such an indicator, incorporating variables related to carbon emissions, energy efficiency, sustainable practices, and economic performance of the tourism sector.

Exploring the Relationship Between Tourism Economic Growth and Carbon Emissions Beyond the EKC Hypothesis: While the paper discusses the initial Environmental Kuznets Curve (EKC) characteristics observed in the YRB, further research could explore this relationship in other stages of economic development or in different geographical contexts. Additionally, studies could investigate the policies, innovations, and consumer behaviors that might flatten or invert the EKC for tourism, leading to sustainable growth with reduced carbon emissions.
