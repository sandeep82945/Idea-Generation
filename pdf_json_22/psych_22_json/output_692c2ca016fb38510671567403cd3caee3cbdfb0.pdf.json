Considering the high impact Covid-19may have onmental health, we have created a psychiatric consultation dedicated to the study, observation and support of patients that developed mental illness after being hospitalized due to Covid-19. Objectives: We aim at 1) describe the profile of patients that developed psychiatric comorbidities following a hospitalization due to Covid-19 and 2) recognize and treat early psychiatric symptoms in Covid-19 patients. Methods: Based on what was described in other epidemic crisis, we established a semi-structured interview to evaluate several dimensions of the patients\u2019 life thatmay have been affected byCovid-19 and that may impact on mental health. The interview included the Depression, Anxiety and Stress Scale (DASS-21), the Impact of Event Scale \u2013 Revised (IES-R) and the Insomnia Severity Index (ISI). Each patient was observed multiple times over several months. Our evaluation was done in parallel with consultations in Internal Medicine. Results: Most patients complained of symptoms directly related with the infection of SARS-CoV-2, namely fatigue, short breath and reduced tolerance to efforts. Importantly, many patients also reported de novo or aggravation of anxiety, stress, depression, sleep disturbances and grief often associated with feelings of existential emptiness and lack of purpose. Conclusions:Hospitalization due to Covid-19 has a high impact on mental health, raising important questions on purpose and emptiness. An early psychiatric intervention is highly recommended.",

Mnif4 1Razi hospital, Skolly, Tunis, Tunisia; 2Razi Hospital, F Adult Psychiatry Department, Manouba, Tunisia; 3Errazi hospitalMannouba, F,Mannouba, Tunisia and 4Razi, Skolly,Manouba, Tunisia *Corresponding author. doi: 10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.1309\nIntroduction: Over the course of COVID 19 illness, olfactory dysfunction was largely described as hyposmia and anosmia. What about phantosmia? Objectives: In this study, we aimed to explore olfactory hallucinations among COVID 19 patients. Methods:Our literature review was based on the PubMed interface and adapted for 2 databases: Science Direct and Google Scholar using the following combination ( phantosmia [MeSH terms]) OR\n(olfactory hallucinations[MeSH terms]) AND (COVID-19 [MeSH terms]). Results: Smell dysfonction is one of the most revealing sign of COVID 19 infection. However, other symptoms particularlty phantosmia tend to emerge later in the course of the disease. Female predominance was noted among patients sufferning from olfactory hallucinations regardless to their medical history. An unpleasant olfactory sensation was the most described sign. The occurene of phantosmia was also described in one case of women suffering from schizophrenia whom tested positive for COVID 19 infection. Conclusions: Olfactory hallucinations are more and more associated with COVID-19 disease regardless to psychiatric disorders. The pathological mechanism remains unclear and further studies are needed for a better comprehension and management.\nDisclosure: No significant relationships.

Romero Guillena*, A.M. Dopico Cervera and A. P\u00e9rez Romero\nUGC Salud Mental Virgen Macarena,, Psychiatry, seville, Spain *Corresponding author. doi: 10.1192/j.eurpsy.2022.1310\nIntroduction: Since the beginning of the pandemic, 4,745,519 cases, 396,878 hospitalizations and 82,884 deaths with COVID-19 have been reported in Spain. As of August 24, 2021, 76.4% of Andalusians over 12 years of age have the complete vaccination regimen Objectives:Main: to calculate the prevalence ofCOVID19 infection, clinical evolution and vaccination rate in a population of patients diagnosed with dual depression. Secondary: compare these data with those obtained in patients diagnosed with non-dual depression Methods: Retrospective descriptive study. The study population is made up of patients diagnosed with dual depression and non-dual depression (according to DSM 5 criterion). Infection, admission, death, and vaccination data were obtained from the patient\u2019s medical history Results: Of the 10 patients diagnosed with dual depression, the prevalence of COVID 19 infection, since the beginning of the pandemic is 0% and of the 30 patients diagnosed with non-dual depression the prevalence is 3.33% (1/28). Of the patients with COVID 19 infection, none required hospital admission and no deaths occurred. The vaccination rate in the group of patients with dual depression is 30% (3/10) and in the group of non-dual depression is 86.66% (26/30), finding statistically significant differences (P<0.01) between both groups. Conclusions: In our study the prevalence of COVID 19 infection in patients diagnosed with dual depression is 0% and the vaccination rate is 30%. While in patients with non-dual depression the prevalence is 3.33%, there were no admissions, no deaths and the vaccination rate is 86.66%.\nDisclosure: No significant relationships.
