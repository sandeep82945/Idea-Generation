The present study aims to identify risks and resources for depressive symptoms and anxiety in children and adolescents during the pandemic in Germany.\nMaterials and Methods: Self-reported data from the first wave of the longitudinal COVID-19 and Psychological Health (COPSY) study were used to investigate risks and resources among n = 811 children and adolescents aged 11\u201317 years. Depressive symptoms and anxiety were measured at the first follow-up 6 months later. Multivariate linear regression analyses were performed to investigate the effects of risks and resources on depressive symptoms and anxiety.\nResults: Parental depressive symptoms predicted depressive symptoms and anxiety in children and adolescents 6 months later. Female gender was identified as a risk factor for anxiety during the pandemic. None of the potential resources were associated with depressive symptoms or anxiety at the follow-up.\nConclusion: The findings provide evidence of risk factors for depressive symptoms and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic. Children and adolescents who face risk factors need to be identified early and monitored during the pandemic. Family-based intervention programs are needed to help vulnerable children and adolescents cope with the challenges of the pandemic.\nKeywords: COVID-19, mental health, risk factors, resource factors, children and adolescents\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 1 July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 901783"

            "text": "The challenges and restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic can have a negative impact on mental health (1, 2). Studies from throughout the world have shown the adverse effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of children and adolescents (3\u20136). Findings from the population-based longitudinal COVID-19 and Psychological Health (COPSY) study show that a majority of children and adolescents in Germany have felt burdened by the pandemic (1). The lack of contact with friends and homeschooling due to school closures represents an additional burden (7, 8). Family life was negatively affected as conflicts within the family increased and escalated more often (8, 9). The COPSY study found that during the pandemic health-related quality of life decreased and the stress level, sleeping problems, loneliness, hyperactivity/inattention, conduct problems, and psychosomatic symptoms increased (8, 10, 11). Of particular note is the significant increase in symptoms of depression and anxiety in children, which seem associated with pandemic measures (12\u201316).\nMental health problems in children may persist into adolescence and pose risk factors for the emergence of mental disorders in adulthood (17\u201319). Therefore, information on risk and resource factors that influence the development of mental health problems such as depressive and anxiety symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic is crucial.\nExisting research identifies risks and resources that are associated with the occurrence of mental problems such as depression and anxiety in children and adolescents. In terms of social risk and resources, studies indicate that social isolation and loneliness as well as lack of peer relationships are linked to depression and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic (2, 14, 20). Moreover, excessive or insufficient demands at school and educational failure have been associated with an increased risk of depression (21). School and kindergarten ideally are a resource and can provide social support, foster emotional development and coping with trauma (22, 23). Traumas like domestic violence, abuse or neglect, which increased during the COVID-19 pandemic (2, 24), can lead to adverse longterm effects such as mental problems in adulthood (25, 26). Especially for traumatized children, social and emotional support can protect against depressive symptoms (27). Studies show that peers, school and good relationships between children and teachers have a promoting effect on mental resilience (28\u201330).\nRegarding familial risks, parental stress and psychopathology play a key role in children\u2019s mental health (31, 32). Conflicts with parents and a negative family climate have an adverse impact on emotional health (33, 34). Children and adolescents whose mothers suffer from depression and those who have a negative mother-child relationship are at higher risk of developing internalizing problems such as depression (35\u201337). Conversely, a two-parent family structure, family cohesion and positive parenting are well-established resource factors for ameliorating mental problems (28, 36, 38).\nAmong personal factors, overall worse psychological health and preexisting psychiatric disorders present important risk factors for the deterioration of mental health (39). Quittkat et al.\nshowed that the COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated the degree of symptom severity in children and adolescents with a history of mental problems (40). Self-esteem, a positive self-concept and an optimistic attitude (34, 38) as well as successful coping mechanisms (41, 42) can be considered resources for the mental health of youth.\nBesides the psychosocial risks and resources, there are biological and sociodemographic factors associated with depressive symptoms and anxiety in youth. Female gender and puberty increase the risk of internalizing symptoms (43). Further, a low socioeconomic status as well as a migration background are strongly associated with psychological problems (8, 28, 44, 45). A study undertaken in Brazil during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated that anxiety rates are higher among children with parents who have essential jobs and who are separated from their parents (46). Quarantined youth living in high epidemic areas (47), who have a high-risk family member (48) or relatives infected with COVID-19 (49) also experienced higher rates of anxiety (6, 50, 51).\nOverall, previous research has examined factors influencing the development of depressive symptoms and anxiety in youth before and at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, there is a lack of knowledge regarding risks and resources for children and adolescents over the course of the pandemic based on longitudinal studies.\nTherefore, the present population-based longitudinal study aims to determine which familial, personal as well as social risk and resources at the early stage of the pandemic predict depressive symptoms and anxiety over the course of the pandemic, i.e., 6 months later. Our hypotheses were that conflicts within the family, school stress and parental depressive symptoms (risk factors) predict depressive symptoms and anxiety in children and adolescents during the pandemic. Further, we assumed that a positive family climate, personal resources and social support (resource factors) are associated with fewer depressive symptoms and anxiety."

The design and methodology of the COPSY study is conceptualized based on the population-based longitudinal BELLA study. The BELLA study presents the mental health module of the German National Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS) (52). The first wave of the COPSY study was conducted from May 26th to June 10th, 2020. At that time Germany was under a partial nationwide lockdown, with educational institutions, leisure and cultural facilities partly closed or restricted. In total, n = 1,586 parents of children aged 7\u201317 years as well as n = 1,040 children and adolescents aged 11\u201317 years took part in the online survey. The second wave of the COPSY study took place from December 17th, 2020 to January 25th, 2021, during the second wave of the pandemic.\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 2 July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 901783\nAt that time, there was a complete nationwide lockdown, with schools as well as leisure and cultural facilities closed. Families who had participated in the first wave of the COPSY study were re-contacted, informed about the second wave and asked for their consent. Overall, n = 1,288 families participated in the second wave (re-participation rate of 85.1%). A responder versus non-responder analysis revealed no significant differences in sociodemographic or health-related variables. The samples match the sociodemographic characteristics (age, gender, education, region) of the German population according to the Microcensus of 2018. The COPSY study was approved by the Local Psychological Ethics Committee and the Commissioner for Data Protection of the University of Hamburg. Detailed information on the design, methods and results of the first two waves of the COPSY study can be found elsewhere (1, 53)."

In addition, depressive symptoms at baseline (\u00df = 0.48, p < 0.001) and anxiety at baseline (\u00df = 0.64, p < 0.001) also showed positive associations with anxiety at follow-up. An examination of the risk factors revealed that all the risk factors proved to be significant predictors of later depressive symptoms and anxiety. Parental depressive symptoms were most strongly associated with depressive symptoms (\u00df = 0.39, p \u2264 0.001) and anxiety (\u00df = 0.27, p \u2264 0.001) at follow-up. In terms of resource factors, all were associated with fewer depressive symptoms and anxiety 6 months later. Personal resources demonstrated the strongest negative association with depressive symptoms (\u00df = \u20130.41, p \u2264 0.001) and anxiety (\u00df = \u20130.39, p \u2264 0.001) at follow-up."

            "text": "Frontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 5 July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 901783\nFindings of the univariate regression analyses showed that the examined risk factors such as family conflicts, school burden and parental depressive symptoms were positively associated with stronger depressive symptoms and anxiety in children and adolescents during the pandemic. However, most of the identified risk factors did not predict later depressive symptoms and anxiety in our multivariate analysis. This might be due to the fact that in the interaction of several risk factors, family conflicts and school burden lose their significance. Further, controlling for depression and anxiety scores at baseline means that we modelled the change in depression and anxiety scores from baseline to follow-up. Thus, it is likely that predictors that are important for the occurrence of depression or anxiety per se might not turn out to be significant regarding the change in these outcomes.\nIn the multivariate model, only parental depressive symptoms emerged as a risk factor for depressive symptoms and anxiety in children and adolescents 6 months later. This finding is in line with previous studies investigating the relationship between parental psychopathology and mental disorders in children and adolescents (32, 36, 37).\nIn the univariate regression analyses, the examined factors such as personal resources, family climate and social support were significantly associated with fewer depressive symptoms and anxiety 6 months later. However, we found no direct effects of those resource factors in our multivariate model. Nevertheless, the important role of family cohesion in the context of internalizing mental health problems has been well examined in previous studies (35, 61, 62). Our results of the univariate regression analyses thus underline the importance of family-based intervention programs during the COVID-19 pandemic to support a positive family climate and strengthen family cohesion to mitigate the adverse effects of potential risk factors. Furthermore, special mental health counseling and support services should be offered for parents with depressive symptoms or mental health issues as well as for children and adolescents with pre-existing psychological health problems to cope with the additional burden of the pandemic.\nRegarding the examined control variables, we found that depressive symptoms and anxiety at baseline were associated with depressive symptoms at follow-up. Moreover, anxiety at baseline predicted anxiety at follow-up. This finding is in line with the fact that mental disorders are highly recurrent and persistent and often last into adulthood (63). In addition, female gender was significantly associated with stronger symptoms of anxiety at follow-up, which is consistent with previous studies on gender distribution in internalizing disorders indicating that females are about twice as likely to experience anxiety compared to males (64, 65).\nThe present study shows the following limitations. The variables included in our multivariate regression analyses explained 40.3% of the variance in depressive symptoms and 43.7% of the variance in anxiety. Although this is a sizeable proportion, these findings may suggest that the development of depressive symptoms and anxiety during the COVID-19 pandemic is related to other important factors that we did not take into account in our models. These factors can be genetic risks, environmental aspects such as living conditions\nor the experience of stressful life events, domestic violence, and abuse (66). These aspects should be investigated in future studies. Moreover, it should be noted that the populationbased COPSY study cannot identify causal relationships, as it is an observational study that only detects associations between risk and resource factors. Furthermore, it cannot be ruled out that other events occurred between the baseline and follow-up that influenced the development of depressive symptoms and anxiety during the pandemic. With regard to the assessment of depressive symptoms and anxiety measured by established and validated screening questionnaires it should be noted that these instruments are mostly not suitable for clinical diagnoses of mental health problems. The results of the COPSY study are neither generalizable nor transferable to other countries due to possible differences in study design and methodology as well as existing differences in conditions during the pandemic such as infection rates, lockdown measures and access to health care services.\nThe present study has the following strengths. First of all, the COPSY study is one of the first population-based longitudinal studies on health-related quality of life and mental health in children and adolescents with two measurement points during the COVID-19 pandemic. The study provides important findings on psychosocial risks and resources for the development of depressive symptoms and anxiety in children and adolescents during the pandemic, that are highly relevant for prevention, clinical practice and policy. The strengths of the COPSY study include the wide age range of the participants and the longitudinal analysis over a pandemic time period of 6 months. We examined a large population-based sample of n = 811 children and adolescents including their parents. Established self- and proxy-report measures were used to assess a range of psychosocial risk and resource factors. The selfreported data allowed insight into the perspective of children and young people.\nOverall, the findings of the present study revealed that parental depressive symptoms were associated with stronger depressive symptoms and anxiety in children and adolescents during the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the high number of adults affected by depression and anxiety during the pandemic, the overall poorer mental health of parents is of particular concern for the emotional health of children and young people. Compared to pre-pandemic data showing a prevalence of 10.1% for depression among adults in Germany (67), the prevalence in this study, also assessed with the PHQ-8, is slightly higher at 14.7% during the pandemic. Other studies have also shown that parents reported higher rates of depression and anxiety during the pandemic compared to pre-pandemic estimates (68, 69). Mothers seem to be particularly impacted, most likely due to a higher burden caused by household chores, homecare/schooling and home office during lockdown phases (70, 71). These results are in line with several studies from Germany (72\u201374) as well as international reviews (75\u201378) reporting high prevalence rates for depression and anxiety in the general population during the pandemic.\nFurther, girls seem to be at higher risk than boys for developing anxiety during the pandemic. Special focus should\nFrontiers in Psychiatry | www.frontiersin.org 6 July 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 901783\nalso be placed on children and adolescents who have already shown depressive symptoms and anxiety at the start of the pandemic. These children and adolescents at higher risk for developing mental health problems during the COVID-19 pandemic need to be detected at an early stage to avoid mental health problems exacerbate into clinical mental disorders. Based on our findings, we recommend the implementation of low-threshold prevention and intervention measures such as resource-oriented and family-based as well as parent support programs in communities, kindergartens and schools to target this high risk youth. In addition, in the planning of lockdown measures such as school closures or social distancing, the mental health of children and adolescents should be carefully taken into account. Particularly politicians as well as education and healthcare professionals should be aware of the importance of preventive measures for child and adolescent mental health during the COVID-19 pandemic. The latter need to be empowered by financial resources to plan and implement such measures. Future research is needed to identify further risk and resource factors for the development of mental health problems in children and adolescents over the course of the pandemic, so that prevention and intervention measures can be adapted to the specific burden and needs of children and adolescents to help them cope with these challenging times."
