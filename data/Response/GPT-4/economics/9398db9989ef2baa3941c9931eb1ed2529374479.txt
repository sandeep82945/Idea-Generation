Impact of Climate Change on Multicommodity Trade Flows: Explore how climate change affects agricultural productivity in different regions and its subsequent impact on international trade flows and prices. This research can extend the current model by incorporating climate variables and predictions to simulate future scenarios of agricultural output, trade routes, and their resilience to climate impacts.

Integration of Digital Currency and Blockchain Technology in Trade Finance: Investigate how the inclusion of digital currencies and blockchain technology could enhance the efficiency of international trade, especially in the agricultural sector. This could involve the development of a model that simulates the effects of these technologies on reducing transaction costs, improving transparency, and streamlining payments across borders, ultimately affecting trade flows and equilibrium prices.

Analysis of Supply Chain Disruptions on Food Security: Conduct a comprehensive study on the effects of supply chain disruptions (due to pandemics, wars, or natural disasters) on food security worldwide. This could extend the existing model to include a wider range of commodities and simulate disruptions in key nodes or links within the international trade network, analyzing the ripple effects on global food prices and availability.

Role of Transportation Infrastructure Development in Enhancing Trade Efficiency: Explore the potential impacts of transportation infrastructure development (e.g., new ports, railroads, highways) in key trading countries on the efficiency of trade routes and overall trade costs. This research could model different infrastructure development scenarios to assess their effects on trade volumes, prices, and global food security.

Effects of Trade Policies and Agreements on Emerging Economies: Examine the implications of trade policies and agreements (tariffs, subsidies, trade deals) on emerging economies, with a focus on agriculture. This research could model the economic outcomes of various policy changes or new trade agreements for these countries, considering their impacts on trade balances, agricultural prices, and food security.
