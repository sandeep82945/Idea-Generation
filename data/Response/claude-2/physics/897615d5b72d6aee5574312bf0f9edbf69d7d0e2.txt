 Here are 5 potential future research ideas after reading this paper on modeling deformable viral capsomers:

1. Investigate the effects of different charge distributions on the capsomers. The paper briefly explores adding charges to the top layer, but varying the amount and location of charges could impact assembly in interesting ways. 

2. Examine co-assembly with other molecules like RNA or polyions. The paper focuses on empty capsid assembly, but adding genomic material or other charged molecules could alter the assembly pathways.

3. Study the kinetics of assembly and disassembly in more detail by tracking bond formation events over time. This could reveal new insights into assembly mechanisms and error correction capabilities. 

4. Expand the model to simulate dimorphic assembly into both T=3 and T=4 capsids, which was linked to capsomer flexibility. This could help further elucidate the factors controlling polymorphic assembly.

5. Incorporate explicit solvent particles and electrostatics instead of implicit solvent modeling. This would better capture hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions underlying assembly, albeit at higher computational cost.
