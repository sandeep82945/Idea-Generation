    "abstractText": "Depression is a serious public-health issue. Recent reports have suggested higher susceptibility to viral infections in depressive patients. However, how depression affects antiviral innate immune signaling remains unknown. Here, we revealed a reduction in expression of Abelson helper integration site 1 (AHI1) in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and macrophages from the patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), which leads to attenuated antiviral immune response. We found that depression-related arginine vasopressin (AVP) induces reduction of AHI1 in macrophages. Further studies demonstrated that AHI1 is a critical stabilizer of basal type-I-interferon (IFN-I) signaling. Mechanistically, AHI1 recruits OTUD1 to deubiquitinate and stabilize Tyk2, while AHI1 reduction downregulates Tyk2 and IFN-I signaling activity in macrophages from both MDD patients and depression model mice. Interestingly, we identified a clinical analgesic meptazinol that effectively stimulates AHI1 expression, thus enhancing IFN-I antiviral defense in depression model mice. Our study promotes the understanding of the signaling mechanisms of depression-mediated antiviral immune dysfunction, and reveals meptazinol as an enhancer of antiviral innate immunity in depressive patients.",

Recent reports have suggested higher susceptibility to viral infections in depressive patients. However, how depression affects antiviral innate immune signaling remains unknown. Here, we revealed a reduction in expression of Abelson helper integration site 1 (AHI1) in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and macrophages from the patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), which leads to attenuated antiviral immune response. We found that depression-related arginine vasopressin (AVP) induces reduction of AHI1 in macrophages. Further studies demonstrated that AHI1 is a critical stabilizer of basal type-I-interferon (IFN-I) signaling. Mechanistically, AHI1 recruits OTUD1 to deubiquitinate and stabilize Tyk2, while AHI1 reduction downregulates Tyk2 and IFN-I signaling activity in macrophages from both MDD patients and depression model mice. Interestingly, we identified a clinical analgesic meptazinol that effectively stimulates AHI1 expression, thus enhancing IFN-I antiviral defense in depression model mice. Our study promotes the understanding of the signaling mechanisms of depression-mediated antiviral immune dysfunction, and reveals meptazinol as an enhancer of antiviral innate immunity in depressive patients.\nCell Research (2022) 32:897\u2013913; https://doi.org/10.1038/s41422-022-00689-9"

            "text": "Depression is one of the leading causes of years lived with disability worldwide. Patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) show great decrements in quality of life, and ~15% of MDD patients ultimately die of suicide.1,2 Depression often induces or worsens other associated diseases.3 To date, limited studies on depression and virus infection have only suggested their correlation. Depression is reported to be associated with the disease progression and increased complications of some viral infections such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).4\u20136 In addition, several studies reported that MDD patients have a higher risk to infection of viruses, including herpes zoster,7,8 suggesting that depression could increase susceptibility to viral infection. As a matter of fact, viral infection in turn promotes the occurrence and development of depression.9,10 Therefore, viral infection is considered a severe threat to depressive patients. However, whether and how depression affects antiviral innate immune signaling remains unexplored. Antiviral innate immunity is the first line of defense against viral infection. Upon infection, the pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) of innate immune cells can recognize the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) of the viruses, leading to type-I interferon (IFN-I) production.11\u201313 IFN-I then binds to a type-I IFN\nreceptor (IFNAR) that consists of two chains (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2), which are present on the cell surface of almost all types of cells. Upon binding, IFN-I induces tyrosine phosphorylation of Janus kinase (JAK1 and Tyk2). JAK1 and Tyk2 further activate STAT1 and STAT2 to form the ISGF3 complex with IRF9, which translocates into the nucleus to bind with IFN-stimulated response elements (ISRE) in the promoter of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs), and eventually induces expression of hundreds of ISGs to promote antiviral innate immunity.14\u201317 Recently, the regulation of the stability of basal IFN signaling has received great attention due to its crucial roles in controlling numerous physiological or pathological responses, whereas IFN signaling is widely disturbed by internal environmental factors (such as inflammatory cytokines and the tumor microenvironment) in the body, leading to instability and dysregulation of basal IFN signaling.18\u201320 Therefore, revealing the regulation of basal IFN-I signaling stability is of great significance for understanding the immune dysfunction under different conditions. Regarding depressive patients, how depression affects the abovementioned innate immune signaling remains to be illuminated. Here, we observed a substantial reduction in Abelson helper integration site 1 (AHI1) expression levels in not only peripheral macrophages but also lung and liver tissues from MDD patients or depressive model mice. Intriguingly, we uncovered that arginine\nReceived: 7 February 2022 Accepted: 24 June 2022 Published online: 12 July 2022\n1International Institute of Infection and Immunity, Institutes of Biology and Medical Sciences, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China. 2Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Infection and Immunity, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China. 3Institute of Neuroscience, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China. 4Institute for Fetology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China. 5Department of Psychiatry, the Affiliated Guangji Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China. 6Department of Neurology, the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China. 7Department of Intensive Care Medicine, the First Affiliated Hospital of Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China. 8Jiangsu Key Laboratory of Neuropsychiatric Diseases, Soochow University, Suzhou, Jiangsu, China. 9These authors contributed equally: Hong-Guang Zhang, Bin Wang. \u2709email: xingshunxu@suda.edu.cn; huizheng@suda.edu.cn\nwww.nature.com/cr www.cell-research.comCell Research\n1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0 () ;,:\nvasopressin from depression-related hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) system induced AHI1 reduction in macrophages, and AHI1 reduction dramatically inhibited the expression of ISGs and attenuated host antiviral innate immunity. Further studies revealed a critical role of AHI1 in maintaining the stability of IFN-I signaling. Importantly, we identified meptazinol as an effective stimulator of AHI1 expression that strongly enhances IFN-I signaling and improves the antiviral immunity of depression model mice.\nRESULTS Depression induces AHI1 reduction that attenuates antiviral immune response Previous studies from our group and others revealed that neuronal deficiency of AHI1, which is abundant in the hypothalamus and amygdala, is associated with depression.21\u201323 We found that AHI1 was also expressed in other types of cells, including macrophages, epithelial cells and fibroblast cells. Intriguingly, Ahi1 mRNA levels were significantly reduced in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of unmedicated MDD patients, compared with the age/sex-matched healthy control subjects (Fig. 1a). We further examined Ahi1mRNA expression in peripheral macrophages and T and B cells separated from PBMCs of MDD patients. The results showed that peripheral macrophages from unmedicated MDD patients exhibited the most dramatic reduction in Ahi1 expression, although other types of cells also showed Ahi1 reduction to some extent (Fig. 1b; Supplementary information, Fig. S1a). To confirm that depression induces Ahi1 reduction, we used a spatial restraint stress mouse model that has been well documented to induce depression-like behaviors in mice.21,24,25 We observed increased immobility times in the forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST) in depression model mice (DMM) (Supplementary information, Fig. S1b, c),21 suggesting that the depression model has been established successfully. Consistent with the data from MDD patients, Ahi1 mRNA levels in both PBMCs (Fig. 1c) and macrophages (Fig. 1d) from these depression model mice were markedly reduced, compared with those from the normal control mice. Accordingly, AHI1 protein levels in the PBMCs of depression model mice substantially decreased (Supplementary information, Fig. S1d). The lung and liver tissues of these depression model mice also showed reduced levels of AHI1 (Fig. 1e), suggesting that depression induces AHI1 reduction in multiple tissues of the body, which could probably result from the regulation by certain systemic circulation factors such as depression-related hormones. To explore the potential significance of AHI1 reduction on immune dysfunction in MDD patients, we utilized RNA sequencing technology to analyze the differential gene expression in Ahi1\u2212/\u2212 cells. Interestingly, we noticed that the vast majority of interferoninduced gene (Ifi) family members, e.g., Ifit1, Ifit2, Ifit3, Ifi202b, Ifi205, exhibited significantly lower expression in Ahi1\u2212/\u2212 cells than in Ahi1+/+ cells (Fig. 1f; Supplementary information, Fig. S1e). In addition, among the top 50 differentially expressed genes in terms of fold changes, there are many well-recognized ISGs, including Cxcl10, Rsad2 (Viperin), Ifi- and Serpin-family members (Fig. 1g). We then confirmed the downregulation of Ifit1 and Rsad2, two widely used representative ISGs, in Ahi1\u2212/\u2212 cells by RT-qPCR (Supplementary information, Fig. S1f). Importantly, peripheral macrophages from the unmedicated MDD patients also displayed a significant reduction in the expression levels of the representative ISGs compared with those from healthy controls (Fig. 1h; Supplementary information, Fig. S1g). These observations suggested that AHI1 deficiency in cells could downregulate basal ISG expression. Based on the above findings, we speculated that the antiviral ability of AHI1-deficient cells could be compromised. Thus, we first used two RNA viruses, vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and influenza A virus (H1N1, PR8/34), and one DNA virus-herpes\nsimplex virus 1 (HSV-1). In line with this speculation, knockout of Ahi1 in mouse macrophages strongly promoted infection of these viruses (Fig. 1i; Supplementary information, Fig. S2a). Similarly, downregulation of AHI1 using two specific shRNAs also facilitated VSV infection (Supplementary information, Fig. S2b). These findings implied that AHI1 reduction in unmedicated MDD patients could attenuate their antiviral defense, which could provide clues for understanding the mechanisms by which MDD patients are usually more susceptible to viral infection. Further results in depression model mice also showed that they were more susceptible to viral infection than control mice (Fig. 1j). Given that depression results in AHI1 reduction in many types of cells and tissues, we employed AHI1-knockout (Ahi1\u2212/\u2212) mice to directly study the significance of AHI1 deficiency in regulating the antiviral ability of the host. Our results showed that AHI1 deficiency in mice significantly promoted viral infection, as shown by increased virus titers in the blood of Ahi1\u2212/\u2212 mice challenged with viruses for 24 h (Fig. 1k). Consistently, the spleen, liver and lung tissues of Ahi1\u2212/\u2212 mice showed higher levels of viral RNAs than those of Ahi1+/+ mice (Supplementary information, Fig. S2c). Immunofluorescence analysis of viruses (Fig. 1l) and hematoxylineosin (H&E) staining of virus-infected lung tissues (Supplementary information, Fig. S2d) confirmed more viruses and more severe tissue damage in Ahi1\u2212/\u2212 mice. In addition, we noticed that AHI1 deficiency did not significantly affect the percentage of peripheral monocytes/macrophages in the mice (Supplementary information, Fig. S2e), suggesting that the decrease in antiviral ability of Ahi1\u2212/\u2212 mice could be due to the changes of cellular antiviral immune activity but not the numbers of these cells. Taken together, these findings revealed that depression induces AHI1 reduction in multiple tissues of the body, which weakens host antiviral ability.\nAHI1 deficiency attenuates IFN-I signaling and cellular antiviral innate immunity We further explored how AHI1 deficiency affects cellular antiviral activity and host antiviral defense. AHI1 knockout in primary macrophages did not upregulate expression of both TNF\u03b1 and IFN\u03b2 (Supplementary information, Fig. S3a, b), as well as virusinduced production of IFN-I (Fig. 2a). However, AHI1 deficiency significantly inhibited both basal and IFN-I-induced expression of the representative ISGs, including Ifit1, Rsad2, and Mx1 (Fig. 2b; Supplementary information, Fig. S3c). Consistently, knockdown of AHI1 attenuated IFN-I-induced ISRE promoter activity (Supplementary information, Fig. S3d). In line with the regulation of ISG expression, AHI1 deficiency largely restricted IFN-I-induced antiviral activity in cells (Fig. 2c). Conversely, AHI1 overexpression significantly enhanced IFN-I-induced antiviral activity (Supplementary information, Fig. S3e, f). Consistently, in IFNAR1-deficient cells, AHI1 failed to significantly regulate cellular antiviral activity (Supplementary information, Fig. S3g). These findings suggested that AHI1 could regulate the strength of IFN-I-induced signaling and subsequent cellular antiviral activity. We next collected peripheral macrophages from MDD patients, which showed significantly reduced Ahi1 levels (Fig. 2d), to observe their responses to viral infection and IFN-I stimulation. The results showed that macrophages from these MDD patients had decreased antiviral ability, compared with those from healthy controls (Fig. 2d). Consistently, when stimulated with IFN-I, macrophages from these MDD patients showed lower expression levels of ISGs than those from healthy controls (Fig. 2e; Supplementary information, Fig. S3h). We then turned to Ahi1\u2212/\u2212 mice and depression model mice. In line with the above findings, Ahi1\u2212/\u2212mice showedmuch lower basal expression of ISGs in the spleen tissues (Fig. 2f), also in the lung and liver tissues (Supplementary information, Fig. S3i, j), than Ahi1+/+ mice, suggesting that AHI1 is essential for maintaining basal IFN-I signaling. Furthermore, the responses of depression model mice to IFN-I administration were observed. Compared with normal control\nCell Research (2022) 32:897 \u2013 913\nmice, depression model mice showed significantly lower expression levels of both basal ISGs and IFN-I-induced ISGs (Fig. 2g). Collectively, these findings revealed a crucial role of AHI1 in sustaining IFN-I signaling, and demonstrated that AHI1 deficiency attenuated IFN-I antiviral innate immunity.\nDepression-related AHI1 deficiency lowers Tyk2 protein levels and stability Given that AHI1 deficiency inhibits IFN-I signaling activity, we next explored the underlying mechanisms. We observed that AHI1 reduction can inhibit IFN-I-induced activation of STAT1, a central\nCell Research (2022) 32:897 \u2013 913\nsignaling protein of IFN-I signaling, in both macrophages (Fig. 3a) and lung A549 cells (Supplementary information, Fig. S4a). Further analysis on the signaling molecules in IFN-I signaling upstream of STAT1 revealed that AHI1 deficiency did not affect the levels of either IFNAR1 or IFNAR2 (Fig. 3b; Supplementary information, Fig. S4b\u2013d). AHI1 knockout in primary macrophages (Fig. 3c) or AHI1 knockdown in RAW264.7 (Fig. 3d) did not substantially affect the levels of JAK1, STAT1, STAT2 or IRF9, but dramatically lowered Tyk2 protein levels. To confirm this phenomenon, we analyzed Tyk2 protein levels in other types of Ahi1\u2212/\u2212 cells. We found that Tyk2 protein levels were strongly reduced in both fibroblasts (Supplementary information, Fig. S4e) and lung epithelial tissues from Ahi1\u2212/\u2212 mice (Supplementary information, Fig. S4f). These findings confirmed that AHI1 critically regulates Tyk2 protein levels in cells. Knockdown of cellular AHI1 did not significantly affect Tyk2 mRNA levels (Fig. 3e), suggesting that AHI1 does not regulate Tyk2 through the transcription level. We then performed a cycloheximide (CHX) pulse chase assay to analyze Tyk2 protein stability. AHI1 deficiency remarkably accelerated Tyk2 protein degradation in both macrophages (Fig. 3f) and lung epithelial A549 cells (Supplementary information, Fig. S4g), indicating that AHI1 regulates Tyk2 protein stability. Janus kinase (Tyk2/JAK1) is named from an analogy with the two-faced Roman \u201cGod of Gates and Doors\u201d, Janus, and represents the most proximal step in IFN-I signaling.26\u201328 Therefore, Tyk2 and JAK1 are considered initial and pivotal components to deliver IFN-I signaling activation. However, the delicate regulation of Tyk2 protein stability in IFN-I signaling, as well as other signaling pathways related to autoimmune diseases, remains unknown. Thus, revealing the regulation of Tyk2 stability will promote our understanding of the key mechanisms controlling the stability of IFN-I signaling. As AHI1 was reduced in depression model mice (Fig. 1c\u2013e), we speculated that Tyk2 proteins could also decrease in these mice. In line with this speculation, the levels of Tyk2 protein in depression model mice were notably downregulated (Fig. 3g). Moreover, we collected PBMCs from unmedicated MDD patients and found that the protein levels of Tyk2 but not another IFN-I signaling protein, STAT1, in MDD patients also noticeably decreased (Fig. 3h). Consistently, the peripheral macrophages from MDD patients that had reduced Ahi1 levels showed lower levels of Tyk2, compared with those from healthy control (Supplementary information, Fig. S4h). Taken all together, these findings suggested that AHI1 reduction in depressive mice and humans impairs Tyk2 protein stability and subsequent IFN-I signaling activity.\nAHI1 recruits OTUD1 to maintain Tyk2 protein levels Given that AHI1 regulates Tyk2 protein stability, we proposed that AHI1 could affect ubiquitination modifications of Tyk2. Neither ubiquitin E3 ligases nor deubiquitinases of Tyk2 have been reported, we thus utilized PR-619, a broad-spectrum deubiquitinase inhibitor, to analyze whether any deubiquitinase is involved in AHI1-mediated\nregulation of Tyk2 levels. Interestingly, we found that PR-619 treatment completely abolished Tyk2 upregulation mediated by AHI1 (Fig. 4a), suggesting that deubiquitinases play a major role of in the AHI1-mediated increase in Tyk2 protein levels. Furthermore, by mass spectrometry analysis of the potential AHI1-interacting proteins, we noticed a deubiquitinase OTUD1, which displayed many more identified peptides in the AHI1-overexpressing group than in the vector control group (Fig. 4b). Next, we confirmed the interaction between AHI1 and OTUD1, as well as Tyk2, in both primary macrophages (Fig. 4c) and A549 cells (Supplementary information, Fig. S5a). OTUD1 as a deubiquitinase has recently been reported to regulate the levels of several proteins.24,29\u201331 We found that OTUD1 overexpression increased Tyk2 protein levels in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary information, Fig. S5b), while OTUD1 knockout in primary macrophages dramatically reduced Tyk2 protein levels (Fig. 4d). Importantly, OTUD1 knockdown inhibited the AHI1-mediated upregulation of Tyk2 levels (Fig. 4e), suggesting that OTUD1 is essential for the AHI1-mediated regulation of Tyk2 protein levels. We noticed that AHI1 did not strongly affect OTUD1 protein levels (Fig. 4f) but affected the interaction between OTUD1 and Tyk2, as shown by the abolishment of the OTUD1-Tyk2 interaction upon AHI1 knockout in primary macrophages (Fig. 4g). Consistently, the spleen tissues of depression model mice displayed lower AHI1 levels and less interaction between OTUD1 and Tyk2 than those of normal mice (Fig. 4h). However, OTUD1 deficiency did not strongly affect the AHI1-Tyk2 interaction (Supplementary information, Fig. S5c). These findings suggested that Tyk2 can interact with AHI1, which recruits OTUD1 to maintain Tyk2 protein levels. Collectively, our results demonstrated a critical role of OTUD1 in maintaining AHI1-mediated regulation of Tyk2 protein levels.\nOTUD1 regulates the K48-linked polyubiquitination of Tyk2 dependently on AHI1 To reveal the role of the deubiquitinase OTUD1 in AHI1-mediated regulation of Tyk2, we further determined the effects of OTUD1 on Tyk2 ubiquitination. We found that the deubiquitinase-inactive mutant of OTUD1 (OTUD1-C320A-H431Q, CH)\n24 lost the ability to upregulate Tyk2 protein levels (Fig. 5a), suggesting that OTUD1 could regulate Tyk2 ubiquitination. In line with this, OTUD1 deficiency in both primary macrophages (Fig. 5b) and MEFs (Supplementary information, Fig. S5d), as well as A549 cells (Supplementary information, Fig. S5e), markedly improved Tyk2 ubiquitination levels, whereasOTUD1 overexpression inhibited Tyk2 ubiquitination (Fig. 5c; Supplementary information, Fig. S5f). Importantly, AHI1 deficiency inhibited OTUD1-mediated both downregulation of Tyk2 ubiquitination (Fig. 5c) and upregulation of Tyk2 protein levels (Supplementary information, Fig. S5g), suggesting that OTUD1 regulates Tyk2 ubiquitination and protein levels dependently on AHI1. OTUD1 has been reported to be able to regulate both K48-linked and K63-linked ubiquitination of protein substrates.24 We then\nFig. 1 Depression induces AHI1 reduction that attenuates antiviral immune response. a RT-qPCR analysis of Ahi1 mRNA levels in human PBMCs from healthy controls (Healthy, n= 50) and unmedicated MDD patients (MDD, n= 15). b RT-qPCR analysis of Ahi1 mRNA levels in monocytes/macrophages (M\u03d5) separated from PBMCs of healthy controls (n= 6) and unmedicated MDD patients (n= 6). c\u2013e Depression model mice (DMM) were made in male ICR mice by a spatial restraint stress model for three weeks.

Based on the commonly recognized HPA system that plays\nkey roles in depression, we first analyzed the effects of several hormones, including adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), AVP and glucocorticoids, which can be secreted into peripheral circulation from the HPA system. The results showed that AVP, but neither ACTH nor the glucocorticoid dexamethasone (Dex), significantly\nCell Research (2022) 32:897 \u2013 913\ndownregulated Ahi1 mRNA levels in macrophages (Fig. 6a). Furthermore, AVP, but not ACTH or Dex, dramatically lowered protein levels of both AHI1 and Tyk2 in both primary macrophages and RAW264.7 in a dose-dependent manner (Fig. 6b; Supplementary information, Fig. S6a\u2013c). Moreover, the effect of AVP on AHI1 was dependent on the AVP receptor, since the antagonist for AVP receptor types 1a and 2, conivaptan, abolished AVP-mediated AHI1 reduction (Fig. 6c). In fact, AVP has been reported to be upregulated in depression patients.32 Our data showed that MDD patients did have higher serum AVP levels than the healthy controls (Fig. 6d). In depression model mice, serum AVP levels also increased compared with those in the normal controls (Fig. 6e). Importantly, we found that AVP-induced downregulation of Tyk2 protein levels in primary macrophages was dependent on AHI1 (Fig. 6f). Combining the above results, we speculated that elevated levels of AVP could contribute to the decrease in AHI1 and Tyk2, which could inhibit IFN-I signaling and antiviral activity. Consistent with this speculation, AVP inhibited the expression of not only basal ISGs but also exogenous IFN-I-induced ISGs (Fig. 6g). AVP treatment promoted viral infection (Fig. 6h, i), and inhibited IFN-I-induced antiviral activity (Fig. 6j). In addition, we demonstrated that AVP did not significantly affect the replication of the virus itself in primary macrophages (Supplementary information, Fig. S6d) or the ability of the virus to enter cells (Supplementary information, Fig. S6e). Next, we analyzed whether AVP regulated Ahi1 mRNA reduction in vivo. Administration with AVP (50 ng/kg) for 2 days resulted in reduced Ahi1mRNA expression in PBMCs of mice (Fig. 6k). Consistently, Tyk2 protein levels in mouse spleen tissues also decreased upon AVP treatment (Fig. 6l). Importantly, we observed that AVP administration in mice significantly lowered expression of in vivo ISGs, including Ifit1, Rsad2 and Mx1 (Fig. 6m). Collectively, these findings suggested that depression-elevated AVP contributes to AHI1 and Tyk2 reduction, which in turn inhibits IFN-I signaling activity and eventually attenuates antiviral innate immunity of the host.\nMeptazinol promotes AHI1 expression and enhances cellular IFN-I antiviral activity Our above findings revealed that depression-mediated downregulation of AHI1 results in attenuated antiviral innate immunity. Thus, we further explored potential strategies to improve AHI1 levels for enhancement of IFN-I antiviral activity. By screening some available clinical drugs, we noticed that a potent analgesic, meptazinol, significantly promoted Ahi1 mRNA expression in primary macrophages (Fig. 7a), RAW264.7 (Supplementary information, Fig. S7a, b) and A549 cells (Supplementary information, Fig. S7c, d) in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner. Consistently, protein levels of both AHI1 and Tyk2 were upregulated by meptazinol (Fig. 7b). AHI1 knockout abolished meptazinol-induced upregulation of Tyk2 protein levels (Fig. 7c), suggesting that meptazinol regulates Tyk2 levels through AHI1. Furthermore, meptazinol remarkably upregulated AHI1 mRNA and protein levels, as well as Tyk2 protein levels in primary macrophages (Fig. 7d, e), lung epithelial and fibroblast cells (Supplementary information, Fig. S7e) from depression model mice. Moreover, the levels of both AHI1 (Fig. 7f) and Tyk2 (Fig. 7g) in primary macrophages from MDD patients were upregulated by\nmeptazinol. However, we noticed that meptazinol did not significantly affect mRNA levels of Tyk2 (Supplementary information, Fig. S7f, g) or OTUD1 (Supplementary information, Fig. S7h, i), as well as the \u00b5-opioid receptor for meptazinol (Supplementary information, Fig. S7j) in primary macrophages from either depression model mice or MDD patients. These findings demonstrated that meptazinol efficiency promotes AHI1 expression, which leads to upregulation of Tyk2 protein. We further determined the effects of meptazinol on cellular IFN-I signaling and IFN-I-induced antiviral activity, uncovering that meptazinol treatment strongly promoted IFN-I-induced expression of the representative ISGs, including Ifit1, Rsad2 and Isg15, in primary macrophages (Fig. 7h). We then analyzed the meptazinolmediated regulation of IFN-I antiviral activity. Consistent with the upregulation of ISGs, meptazinol treatment restricted viral infection in a dose-dependent manner (Supplementary information, Fig. S7k). Importantly, IFN-I-induced antiviral activity against both VSV (Fig. 7i) and H1N1 (Fig. 7j) can be improved by meptazinol, whereas knockout of Ahi1 gene blocked meptazinol-induced improvement of IFN-I antiviral activity (Fig. 7i, j). We also noticed that in Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 cells, meptazinol lost the ability to enhance IFN-I antiviral activity (Supplementary information, Fig. S7l). In addition, meptazinol did not significantly affect the replication of the virus itself (Supplementary information, Fig. S7m) or the ability of the virus to enter cells (Supplementary information, Fig. S7n). Taken all together, these findings suggested that meptazinol upregulates Tyk2 protein levels by promoting AHI1 expression, which improves cellular IFN-I signaling and IFN-I antiviral activity.\nMeptazinol enhances the in vivo antiviral immunity of depression model mice We next observed the in vivo effects of meptazinol on AHI1 and Tyk2 levels, as well as host antiviral immunity, in depression model mice. Meptazinol did not result in noticeable cytotoxicity in primary macrophages from either controls or depression model mice (Supplementary information, Fig. S8a). Then, depression model mice were injected with or without meptazinol (10mg/kg) for two days. We found that depression model mice displayed lower Ahi1 mRNA expression than normal controls, while meptazinol administration significantly improved the levels of Ahi1 mRNA in the spleen (Fig. 8a), lung and liver tissues of depression model mice (Supplementary information, Fig. S8b, c). Consistently, meptazinol administration upregulated the protein levels of both AHI1 and Tyk2 (Fig. 8b) in depression model mice. However, meptazinol did not upregulate serum AVP levels in depression model mice (Supplementary information, Fig. S8d). We further found that meptazinol administration in depression model mice promoted the expression of basal ISGs (Supplementary information, Fig. S8e). Moreover, when depression model mice were challenged by viruses, meptazinol administration significantly upregulated the expression levels of ISGs in both the spleen (Fig. 8c) and lung (Fig. 8d) tissues of depression model mice, and suppressed viral levels (Fig. 8e). The significant reduction in virus titers in the blood from depression model mice confirmed that host antiviral immunity was enhanced by meptazinol treatment (Fig. 8f, g). Together, these findings demonstrated that meptazinol administration in mice upregulates\nFig. 4 AHI1 can recruit OTUD1 to maintain Tyk2 protein levels. a Western blot analysis of Tyk2 protein levels in RAW264.7 cells transfected with Myc-AHI1 and then treated with a pan-deubiquitinase inhibitor PR-619 (50 \u03bcM) for 2 h. bMass spectrometry analysis of the potential MycAHI1-binding proteins in A549 cells.

            "text": "Depression impairs multiple systems of the body, including immune system. In the last two decades, studies have focused on how\nimmune inflammatory responses influence the central nervous system and contribute to the pathophysiology of MDD.8,33\u201336 Although the effects of depression on the immune composition and some immune functions have recently been under preliminary observation, the conclusions from these studies are often inconsistent and even controversial.37\u201340 In this work, we focused on antiviral innate immune signaling, and demonstrated that\nCell Research (2022) 32:897 \u2013 913\ndepression compromises IFN-I antiviral innate immunity through AVP-mediated disruption of the AHI1-Tyk2 axis in unmedicated MDD patients. In addition, this study revealed AHI1 as an essential stabilizer of basal IFN-I signaling in cells, which utilizes the\ndeubiquitinase OTUD1 to protect the \u201cGod of Gates and Doors\u201d of IFN-I signaling, Tyk2, from ubiquitination-mediated destruction. Depression could result in specific immune responses that are different from anxiety or simple stress. Although recent studies have\nCell Research (2022) 32:897 \u2013 913\nreported the effects of depression on the numbers and activity of immune cells, most of these observations are incompatible and therefore are not enough to provide reliable clues for understanding how depression attenuates antiviral innate immunity. According to some studies, the numbers of monocytes, CD4+ T and CD8+ T cells in the peripheral blood of MDD patients differ from those in healthy people.37\u201339 However, a study with a large sample size showed no difference in the number of peripheral blood lymphocytes or T-lymphocyte subsets and even natural killer cell (NK) activity between depressive patients and normal controls.41 In addition, a study reported that MDD patients have increased Treg cells,37 while another study showed that Treg cells are defective in MDD patients.38 Moreover, no significant differences in the absolute number of circulating granulocytes, monocytes and lymphocytes, frequencies of major T cell subsets (CD4+ or CD8+) between MDD patients and healthy people were observed in another work.40 These inconsistent findings suggested the possibility that MDD patients could have slight changes in the numbers and percentages of immune cells due to complex individual differences, different stages of diseases, and even whether or not the patients are receiving medical treatment, whereas the activity of certain types of immune cells could contribute in a major way to the immune dysfunction. In this study, we selected unmedicated MDD patients, and found for the first time that the peripheral macrophages of depressive patients have significantly attenuated antiviral immune activity. Importantly, our study revealed an AVP-AHI1-Tyk2 axis, as an explicit signaling mechanism, which addresses depressionmediated inhibition of antiviral immune function of peripheral macrophages and epithelial tissues. AHI1 is associated with some neuropsychiatric and brain developmental disorders such as autism, depression and schizophrenia.1,22,42 It has been reported that Ahi1 conditional knockout leads to typical depressive behaviors inmice.21,43,44 Recent studies revealed that AHI1 deficiency promotes endocytic TrkB degradation and reduces TrkB signaling in neuronal cells.21 In addition, AHI1 deficiency also destabilizes glucocorticoid receptors (GRs) to regulate depression-related gene expression in brains.25 These studies provide clues on understanding the correlation between AHI1-deficiency and depression. Here, we demonstrated that AHI1 is an essential stabilizer of Tyk2 protein levels, and sustains basal IFN-I signaling and host antiviral immunity. However, it is possible that AHI1 could target not only IFN-I signaling but also other signaling molecules to partially regulate antiviral immune response. In fact, AHI1-mediated regulation of GR was only reported in hippocampus cells. AHI1 does not necessarily regulate GR levels in all types of cells used in this study. In addition, GR signaling has been reported to inhibit IFN-I signaling in macrophages.45 If AHI1 interacts and regulates GR in macrophages, AHI1 deficiency-mediated downregulation of GR should enhance IFN-I antiviral signaling,\nwhich is contrary to our findings showing that AHI1 deficiency actually inhibits IFN-I signaling. Thus, the assumed AHI1-GR regulation should not largely affect AHI1-mediated effect on IFN-I antiviral immunity in macrophages. In addition, TrkB protein is specifically highly expressed in the central nervous system, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is the primary ligand and activator for TrkB,46 making TrkB unlikely to be involved in AHI1-IFNmediated antiviral immunity in the cells used in this study, including primary macrophage, epithelial cells and fibroblasts. We also demonstrated that AHI1 does not significantly affect cellular antiviral ability in Ifnar1\u2212/\u2212 cells that lose the response to IFN-I, suggesting the importance of AHI1-IFN signaling in cellular innate antiviral immunity. In addition, we revealed that depression-elevated AVP largely results in Ahi1 mRNA reduction. These findings suggested that AVP from the HPA system leads to on the one hand neuronal AHI1 reduction in brain, which promotes occurrence of depression, and on the other hand AHI1 reduction in both peripheral macrophages and epithelial tissue cells, which attenuated host antiviral innate immunity. Interestingly, it was reported that the levels of AHI1 protein but not AHI1 mRNA in the hippocampus of depressive mice are reduced, which results from glucocorticoid-induced GR signaling.25 However, our results showed that the glucocorticoid did not reduce the levels of AHI1 mRNA or AHI1 protein in macrophages. These differences suggest that macrophages and hippocampus cells have different signaling responses in regulating AHI1 expression. It will be interesting to clarify the signaling crosstalk between different types of cells stimulated by different hormones in the future. In summary, we found that depression-elevated AVP induces AHI1 reduction in macrophages, which further disrupts the deubiquitinase OTUD1-mediated stabilization of cellular Tyk2, thus attenuating basal IFN-I signaling and host antiviral immune defense (Fig. 8h). This study revealed a detailed mechanism of depressionmediated antiviral immunity dysfunction, promoting the understanding of high susceptibility to virus infection in depressive patients. Importantly, meptazinol was identified as a potent drug for increasing AHI1 expression, which eventually improves cellular IFN-I signaling and rescues antiviral immunity of depression model mice. Given that MDD patients are at high risk of viral infection, which further exacerbates the progression of the MDD disease, our findings could provide strategies for both relieving symptoms of MDD patients and ameliorating their life quality."

Oligo(dT)-attached magnetic beads were used to purify mRNA. Purified mRNA was fragmented into small pieces with fragment buffer. Then first-strand cDNA\nCell Research (2022) 32:897 \u2013 913\nwas generated using random hexamer-primed reverse transcription, followed by a second-strand cDNA synthesis. Afterwards, A-Tailing Mix and RNA Index Adapters were added by incubating to end repair. The cDNA fragments obtained were amplified by PCR, and products were purified by Ampure XP Beads, then dissolved in EB solution. The products were validated on the Agilent Technologies 2100 bioanalyzer for quality control. The double-stranded PCR products were heated denatured and circularized by the splint oligo sequence to get the final library. The singlestrand circle DNA (ssCir DNA) was formatted as the final library. The final library was amplified with phi29 to make DNA nanoball (DNB) which had more than 300 copies of one molecular. DNBs were loaded into the patterned nanoarray and single-end 50-base reads were generated on BGIseq500 platform (BGI-Shenzhen, China). Raw data (raw reads) were processed using SOAPnuke (v1.5.2). The reads containing poly-N and lowquality reads were removed to obtain the clean reads. Then, the clean reads were mapped to the reference genome using hisat2. Bowtie2 (v2.2.5) was applied to align the clean reads to the reference coding gene set, then gene expression levels were calculated by RSEM (v1.2.12) Gene ontology enrichment and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathway enrichment analysis of differentially expressed genes were respectively performed using R based on the hypergeometric distribution. The RNA sequencing data have been deposited in the Gene Expression Omnibus with accession no. GSE176217.\nViruses and viral infection in vitro Vesicular stomatitis virus and Sendai virus were gifts from Dr. Chen Wang (China Pharmaceutical University). Herpes Simplex Virus-1 was from Dr. Chunfu Zheng (Fujian Medical University, China). VSV-GFP was from Dr. Chunsheng Dong (Soochow University, China). The antiviral effects of IFN\u03b2 were determined by pretreating cells with IFN\u03b2 for 20 h prior to viral infection. Briefly, cells were transfected with Myc-AHI1 constructs or AHI1 shRNAs. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were pretreated with mIFN\u03b2 (40 IU/mL) for 20 h. After washed twice, cells were challenged by VSV-GFP at an MOI= 0.1 in the serum-free medium for 2 h for virus entry. Then the infection medium was removed by washing twice by 1\u00d7 PBS. Cells were further fed in the fresh 10% FBS medium for 24 h. Then cells were analyzed by immunofluorescence, RT-qPCR or western blot assay. To assess the antiviral ability of cells against HSV-1, cells were collected and viral RNAs were analyzed to detect viral Ul46 gene by RTqPCR."
