    "abstractText": "Coronavirus disease 19 (COVID-19) pandemic is at the moment the main topic of interest regarding medical science and research. Responsible for the disease is a novel coronavirus, the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARSCoV-2) accountable for over 118 million cases and a total of 2.61 million deaths worldwide (July 2020). Drug treatment for infected COVID-19 patients represents a difficult task, since there is no currently licensed specific antiviral for SARS-CoVs, the clinical approach of these patients remains the symptomatic one and also providing supportive care if needed. The clinical approach becomes more of a challenge especially if one has a co-existing psychiatric illness under psychotropic treatment. This concern is raised due to potential drug-to-drug interactions (DDIs) between antiviral agents and psychotropics, not only by common metabolic pathways regarding P450 cytocromial enzymes but also by pharmacological synergism regarding common adverse effects. Thus, we searched to identify studies published in PubMed medical database to support clinical practice in these situations and found that mostly all main psychotropics are implied in DDIs with the antivirals used to treat COVID-19 infection. Therefore, the clinical approach in treating COVID-19 patients with antiviral agents remains a challenge especially for those who have a comorbid psychiatric illness and are under treatment with psychotropics.",

The World Health Organization (WHO) announced the official designation for the current CoV-associated disease to be COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2 on 11 February 2020. A similar disease was described in 2002 as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-1), being responsible for over 8000 cases and at least 774 deaths worldwide. Coronaviruses (CoVs) belong to the Coronaviridae family, consisting of seven members that infect humans, including human CoV 229E (HCoV-229E), HCoVNL63, HCoV-OC43, HCoV-HKU1, SARS-CoV, MERSCoV and now SARS-CoV-2, viruses producing symptoms\nand diseases ranging from the common cold to severe fatal illnesses such as SARS or Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS). Phylogenetic studies have revealed that SARS-CoV-2 has 88% similarity to two SARSlike CoVs derived from bat SARS-like CoVs (batSL-CoVZC45 and bat-SL-CoVZXC21). Like other CoVs, it possesses an unsegmented, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of around 30kb. Molecular studies have revealed an overall 80% nucleotide identity between SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV, and 89% identity with the bat SARS-like CoVs ZC45 and ZXC21. Regarding treatment options of an infected patient, to date, there is no specific antiviral agent. However, many antivirals and immunomodulators are used to treat the infection, among which the most frequently used being hydroxychloroquine (HCLQ),\nritonavir in association with lopinavir (LPV/r), favipiravir (FAVI) and remdesivir (RDV) [1]. The clinical approach of patients treated with these agents becomes a challenge when one has a psychiatric condition being under psychotropic treatment, mostly due to metabolism site interactions regarding cytochrome P450 and pharmacological synergism of the common adverse effects [2]."

However, some studies attribute fluoxetine a low/absent risk in co-administration with COVID-19 medication [5, 14]. Paroxetine, mainly metabolized by isoenzymes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4, with pharmacokinetic properties of protein binding up to 95%, make it susceptible to DDIs. An eloquent example is reported in a study where the co-administration of paroxetine and ritonavir/ fosamprenavir is associated with a low level of antidepressant, an average of 55% due to protein displacement [3]. However, most studies highlight the important DDIs of paroxetine in co-administration with HCLQ or LPV/r, as in the plasmatic high concentration of\nantidepressant and potential ECG QTc prolongation [4, 5, 7, 16]. Escitalopram, although metabolized by the same isoenzymes as previously described, reveals contradictory results. Three studies have found escitalopram with a low risk of DDIs in co-administration with antiviral drugs [5, 6, 8], while five studies have reported moderate to high risk in ECG QTc prolongation, especially when it is associated with HCLQ [3-5, 7, 11]. Sertraline undergoes CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 metabolism, in the process being also implied CYP2B6, CYP2C9 and CYPC19 isoforms. Probably because of this isoenzyme heterogeneity the interaction with antiviral agents seems to be variable. Some studies have attributed the co-administration of sertraline and HCLQ an enhancing risk of hypoglycaemia [3] while others found either an overall low risk of DDIs with antiviral agents [5, 16], or a potential decrease of antidepressant serum concentration in association with ritonavir [4]. Fluvoxamine is a SSRI with moderate inhibitory properties over CYP3A4 isoenzymes [15]. Studies results have shown increased serum concentrations of antiviral agents such as HCLQ or ritonavir in the case of antidepressant associations [3, 8, 10, 11]. Although, there are a few studies that have found the co-administration of fluvoxamine and antiviral agents with a low risk of DDIs [5]. All study results have evidenced the low or absent DDIs of all SSRIs in co-administration with antiviral agents like favipiravir and remdesivir. Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors Often used as a second-line treatment especially for depressive disorders, anxiety disorders, but also for chronic pain syndromes, serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) represent a high potency pharmacological class being frequently prescribed in clinical practice. The main metabolism sites of the drugs are cytochrome P450 isoenzymes CYP2D6 and CYP 3A4, therefore, at least at a theoretical level DDIs are expected. For venlafaxine, mainly metabolized by CYP2D6, CYP3A4 and CYP2C19 isoenzymes, the vast majority of studies draw the attention to be used with caution especially when it is co-administrated with HCLQ or LPV/r, due to the increased risk of QTc prolongation [3-5, 7, 11, 16]. Duloxetine, also metabolized by CYP2D6, but also by CYP1A2 seems to be safe for clinical use in coadministration with HCLQ or LPV/r. Most studies reported no major DDIs, but it is recommended to be monitored closely, due to antidepressant serum concentration variations [3-5, 8] also, in case of severe liver injuries due to an inflammatory state in COVID19 infection, use of duloxetine must be avoided [9, 10]. Serotonin modulators Trazodone, used for the treatment of major depressive disorder, anxiety disorder and obsessive-compulsive disorder, has a metabolism mediated through CYP3A4\nand CYP2D6. The antidepressant\u2019s pharmacodynamics is characterized also by histamine H1 receptor and adrenergic alpha 1 receptor antagonism therefore, coadministration of trazodone and LPV/r is associated with antidepressant serum concentration elevation and serious potential life-threatening side effects such as marked sedation and hypotension, and syncope [3- 5, 8, 11, 12, 16, 23]."

Due to LPV/r induction properties on UGT, valproic acid serum concentrations decrease under concomitant use [3, 5, 11]. However, some studies recommend using with precaution valproic acid due to its possible problematic side effects such as bow marrow suppression, coagulation disorders, and liver toxicity [7, 9, 10]. One study reported LPV/r increased serum concentration in co-administration with valproic acid [4]. Carbamazepine Frequently used in clinical practice, this agent is both a substrate and potent inducer of CYP3A4 isoenzymes. Therefore, antiviral agents such as HCLQ, LPV/r and RDV metabolized at this site present a lowering serum concentration in co-administration with carbamazepine [3, 4, 10]. Most studies recommend also precaution in the use of carbamazepine in infections management due to its liver toxicity side effects and potential bone marrow suppression, especially when co-administrated with a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor like LPV/r leading to elevated mood stabilizer serum concentrations [5, 7-9, 18, 20]. Lithium Because of its pharmacokinetic properties, lithium remains un-metabolized and is excreted unchanged in the urine. However, because of its renal excretion necessity, most studies recommend precaution in its usage [7, 9, 20]. Some studies reported potential cardiac toxicity side effects in concomitant use of lithium and HCLQ or LPV/r [4, 5]. There is some evidence regarding the safety of using mood stabilizers/anticonvulsants and the natural outcome of COVID-19 infection, overall, using these drugs in patients with COVID-19 infection is associated with a slightly increased severe infection outcome, with higher rates for gabapentionoids [13]."

No interactions were found with favipiravir or remdesivir. Chlorpromazine. First developed in 1951, chlorpromazine is one of the first antipsychotics discovered, being used with much less frequency than other firstgeneration antipsychotics. It is because of these considerations why few study results include chlorpromazine and antiviral SARS-CoV 2 agents in DDIs. Among these results, most studies report cardiac arrhythmias such as QTc prolongation [3, 11, 12]. Pimozide. Pimozide is a first-generation antipsychotic metabolized by CYP3A4 and CYP2D6 isoenzymes. All study results that include this antipsychotic conclude that the concomitant use with antiviral agents such\nas HCLQ, CLQ, or LPV/r is associated with a high risk of elevated antipsychotic serum concentration and life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias [3-5, 10, 11].

One of the most effective antipsychotics used in the management of treatment-resistant schizophrenia, clozapine is associated with a moderate to high risk because of the multiple DDIs and overlapped metabolic toxicity. Clozapine is mainly metabolized by CYP1A2, CYP2D6, CYP3A4, but also suffers methylation and oxidation processes. Therefore, because of LPV/r inhibitory properties of the mentioned isoenzymes, the co-administration is associated with an increase in antipsychotic serum concentrations, QTc prolongation, increased metabolic side effects such as hyperglycaemia and hyperlipidaemia, high risk of neutropenia with a problematic clinical approach in the management of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients [3, 4, 7, 9-11]. Risperidone. Like the previous antipsychotics, risperidone has the same metabolism site and is associated with increased serum concentrations when co-administrated with LPV/r or HCLQ. Study results place the use of the antipsychotic at moderate risk, because of its potential QTc prolongation [3-5, 7, 22]. There was one study that reported cases of extrapyramidal symptoms and neuroleptic malignant syndrome when risperidone was associated with ritonavir [8]. Paliperidone.

Studies results have found a low to moderate risk of DDIs in the association of paliperidone and HCLQ or LPV/r, with potential ECG QTc prolongation and recommend precaution in usage especially in cases of SARS-CoV-2 infection associated with renal impairment [4, 5, 7, 9, 10, 12].\nAripiprazole.
