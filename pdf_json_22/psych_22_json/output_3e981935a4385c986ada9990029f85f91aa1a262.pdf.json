    "abstractText": "Robots\u2019 visual qualities (VQs) impact people\u2019s perception of their characteristics and affect users\u2019 behaviors and attitudes toward the robot. Recent years point toward a growing need for Socially Assistive Robots (SARs) in various contexts and functions, interacting with various users. Since SAR types have functional differences, the user experience must vary by the context of use, functionality, user characteristics, and environmental conditions. Still, SAR manufacturers often design and deploy the same robotic embodiment for diverse contexts. We argue that the visual design of SARs requires a more scientific approach considering their multiple evolving roles in future society. In this work, we define four contextual layers: the domain in which the SAR exists, the physical environment, its intended users, and the robot\u2019s role. Via an online questionnaire, we collected potential users\u2019 expectations regarding the desired characteristics and visual qualities of four different SARs: a service robot for an assisted living/retirement residence facility, a medical assistant robot for a hospital environment, a COVID-19 officer robot, and a personal assistant robot for domestic use. Results indicated that users\u2019 expectations differ regarding the robot\u2019s desired characteristics and the anticipated visual qualities for each context and use case.",

Robots\u2019 visual qualities (VQs) impact people\u2019s perception of their characteristics and affect users\u2019 behaviors and attitudes toward the robot. Recent years point toward a growing need for Socially Assistive Robots (SARs) in various contexts and functions, interacting with various users. Since SAR types have functional differences, the user experience must vary by the context of use, functionality, user characteristics, and environmental conditions. Still, SAR manufacturers often design and deploy the same robotic embodiment for diverse contexts. We argue that the visual design of SARs requires a more scientific approach considering their multiple evolving roles in future society. In this work, we define four contextual layers: the domain in which the SAR exists, the physical environment, its intended users, and the robot\u2019s role. Via an online questionnaire, we collected potential users\u2019 expectations regarding the desired characteristics and visual qualities of four different SARs: a service robot for an assisted living/retirement residence facility, a medical assistant robot for a hospital environment, a COVID-19 officer robot, and a personal assistant robot for domestic use. Results indicated that users\u2019 expectations differ regarding the robot\u2019s desired characteristics and the anticipated visual qualities for each context and use case.\nKeywords: Context-driven design \u00b7 Visual qualities \u00b7 Socially assistive robot"

            "text": "Recent years indicate a growing need for Socially Assistive Robots (SARs) [1\u20133]. Examples of SARs exist in the para-medical field [4, 5] and for domestic use, taking care of the elderly or people with disabilities [6, 7], or helping with children [8, 9]. Since SAR types have functional differences, we expect the user-robot interaction to vary by use context, functionality, user characteristics, and environmental conditions [10, 11]. Yet, our market research revealed that SAR manufacturers often design and deploy the same robotic embodiment for diverse contexts (see Sect. 2.1, Table 2). Most studies in the field of SARs\u2019 appearance evaluate users\u2019 perceptions of existing off-the-shelf SARs [12\u201315]. Few studies looked at isolated visual qualities using designated SARs [16].\n\u00a9 The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023 P. Borja et al. (Eds.): HFR 2022, 26, pp. 105\u2013119, 2023. https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-22731-8_8\n106 E. Liberman-Pincu et al.\nThe lack of design research, standards, or a consistent body of knowledge in this field forces designers to start from scratch when designing new robots [17, 18]. Thus, the design of SARs requires a more scientific approach considering their evolving roles in future society. Technological products, even innovative and cutting-edge ones, often fail in the market when the design does not evoke the desired human cognitive response and action, does not apply to environmental conditions, or leads to unrealistic expectations [19\u201321]. When developing new SARs, the focus is mainly on guaranteeing functionality and safety. Aesthetics and robot look are part of the design process but not necessarily context-specific, i.e., one design fits all. Hekkert and van Dijk (2011) [22] suggest the designer should begin by defining a vision for the context and desired interaction of a new product to set the most appropriate visual qualities (VQs) and come up with a suitable solution for particular design problems.\nIn this paper, we first classify SARs by their use contexts by outlining four contextual layers: the domain inwhich the SAR exists, its physical environment, intended users, and role. For example, a robot for the para-medical field, supporting non-professional older adults in their private homes for physical exercises. Then, we examine how potential users perceive SARs in context by delving into the robots\u2019 essential characteristics and desired VQs. We used an online questionnaire to collect participants\u2019 expectations of robot characteristics by contexts of use and their related VQs. We then analyze this data to evaluate users\u2019 perceptions of each robot\u2019s desired character and the factors affecting the participant\u2019s selection of VQs. Finally, we compared the findings with previous work to form design tools to support user- and interaction-centered designs for diverse tasks and use cases of SARs."

For example, to achieve the perception of a friendly SAR, a designer should consider using A-shape or hourglass structure and avoid V-shape, choose light colors (e.g., a combination of white and blue), and avoid dark colors.\nTable 1.

Who leads the interaction?\nDifferent role categorizations are found in the literature; Onnasch andRoesler (2021) [44], for example, classified eight abstract roles for various application domains: Information exchange, Precision (e.g., robots for micro-invasive surgery), Physical load reduction, Transport (transport objects from one place to another), Manipulation (the robot physically modifies its environment), Cognitive stimulation, Emotional stimulation, Physical stimulation. Abdi et al. [45] identified five roles of SAR in elder care: affective therapy, cognitive training, social facilitator, companionship, and physiological therapy.\nFor our model, we used the eight roles based on Onnasch and Roesler (2021) [44], excluding precision (which is less related to social relationships) that was replaced with regulation: Information exchange, Physical load reduction, Transport, Manipulation, Cognitive stimulation, Emotional stimulation, Physical stimulation, and Regulation.\nEach role is classified into a three-level hierarchy of human-robot relationships (robot-led interaction, equal or human-led interaction). For example, in the physical stimulation section, we can have a training robot at the robot-led interaction level, a teammate at the equal level, and a physical therapy robot at the human-led interaction level.

The following paragraph details each case. Table 3 summarizes them.\nA service robot for an Assisted Living/retirement residence facility (ALR) aims to roam the lobby and be used by the facility residents to register for various classes and activities. In addition, it provides information and helps communicate (via video calls and chats) with staff members. A Medical Assistant Robot (MAR) for a hospital environment aims to assist the medical team, especially when social distancing is required. Through it, the medical team can communicate in video calls with isolated patients and bring equipment, food, and medicine into patients\u2019 rooms. A COVID-19 Officer Robot (COR) aims to ensure passersby comply with Covid-19 restrictions like social distancing or wearing a face mask. A Personal Assistant Robot (PAR) for home/domestic use seeks to assist users with daily tasks, recommend activities at home and outside, and remind them of their duties and appointments. The robot allows users to watch videos, listen to music, play, and have video chats with family and friends.\nDesigning Robots with the Context 111"

First, they were asked to define the robot\u2019s desired characteristics by marking relevant words out of a word bank. The word bank contained twelve words based on previous studies related to SARs\u2019 perception [47\u201349] and that were found relevant to our four use cases: innovative, inviting, cute, elegant, massive, friendly, authoritative, aggressive, reliable, professional, intelligent, and threatening. Following Benedek &Miner\u2019s product reaction cards (2002) [50], we followed a similar procedure to our previous studies; however, in this case, participants were not reacting to a design but an idea. In addition, they had the option of adding their own words. Following, they were asked to select three types of VQs: body structure, outline, and color scheme from a set of options, by the alternative that, in their opinion, best expresses the desired characteristics that they have chosen. Figure 4 illustrates the questionnaire design.\nTheonline questionnairewasdistributedusing socialmedia and snowball distribution betweenNovember 2021 toMarch 2022 (via posts on Facebook andWhatsApp).

Participants were grouped into three age groups: up to 29, ages 30\u201349, and 50 and above. Three participants preferred not to indicate gender; hence in our evaluations of gender effect, N = 225 instead of N = 228. The words massive, aggressive, and threatening were selected by less than 2% of the participants and therefore were excluded from our analysis.\n112 E. Liberman-Pincu et al.\nResults confirm that users have different expectations regarding the robot\u2019s characteristics suitable for each context of use. Table 5 presents the top three words selected by participants for each context. Figure 5 illustrates the chosen words for each context in a radar chart.\nWe have found statistically significant relations between the contexts and four describing words: Inviting, Friendly, Elegant, and Authoritative. For example, 78% of the participants indicated that ALR should look inviting, much more than PAR (56%), MAR (54%), and COR (42%), X2 (3, N = 228)= 14.8742, p< .01. The word Friendly is more likely to be ascribed to ALR (81%), MAR (81%), and PAR (75%) but less likely to be attributed to COR (55%), X2 (3, N = 228) = 13.1663, p < .01. Elegant is more suitable for describing a PAR than all three other contexts, X2 (3,N = 228)= 11.5077, p < .01. Finally, authoritative is significantly more suitable for describing a COR than all three other contexts, X2 (3, N = 228) = 44.4546, p < .01.\nIn addition, we have found that the participants\u2019 demographic data (gender and age) affect their selections. Female participants were significantly more likely to select the wordsCute (X2 (1,N = 225)= 6.68, p< .01) andFriendly (X2 (1,N = 225)= 10.813, p < .01). Though a Chi-square test of independence showed that there were no significant associations between gender and the selection of the word Innovative,male participants were more likely to select it (48%) than female participants (37%), (X2 (1, N = 225) = 2.503, p = .11. The words Aggressive and Threatening were selected only by male participants.\nDesigning Robots with the Context 113\nUser age category was found to affect the desire for Innovative robots significantly; younger participants (up to 29) selected this character more frequently (53%) than midage (ages 30\u201349) (42%) and older (50 and above) participants (26%), the relationship between these variables was significant, X2 (2,N = 228)= 10.78, p< .01. Furthermore, results indicate two worth noting yet, not statistically significant trends. Implying that age has a positive correlation with selecting the word Cute and a negative correlation with choosing the word Professional (i.e., older participants tend to desire cuter, less professional-looking robots). Table 6 summarizes the factors affecting the participants\u2019 selection of words."

            "text": "After selecting the characteristics of the SAR, participants were asked to choose the most suitable visual qualities for the context of use they had. Some VQs were selected more frequently than others regardless of the use context or other factors. For example, most respondents (79%) preferred rounded edges over chamfered ones. Only 10% of the respondents chose the dark color scheme, and most participants (49%) preferred the white color scheme. The two most selected structures were the Hourglass (27%) and the A shape (26%).\n114 E. Liberman-Pincu et al.\nThe context of use impacted just the body structure selection. For the ALR, respondents showed a higher preference for the A shape (37% compared to 26% in the overall data). PAR and COR increased the respondents\u2019 tendency to select the Hourglass structure (32% and 31%, respectively, compared to 27% in the overall data).\nParticipants\u2019 genderwas found to affect their selection of colors significantly,X2 (2,N = 225) = 7.939, p < .05; the male participants were more likely to select the white and blue combination (54%), while the female participants preferred the white option. Participants\u2019 age did not affect their selections, although there were minor differences among the three groups.\nParticipants\u2019 expectations (according to the selected words) significantly affected their selection of several VQs. Wanting to express Inviting increased the participants\u2019 probability of selecting a rounded outline, X2 (1, N = 228) = 7.946, p < .01, and decreased the participants\u2019 probability of selecting the Dark color scheme, X2 (2, N = 228) = 5.537, p = .06. To express Cute participants selected using the white color, X2 (2, N = 228)= 16.03, p< .01, and were more likely to select the A shape structure, X2 (4, N = 228) = 13.23, p < .05. Participants who wished to express Elegant showed a tendency to select chamfered outline significantly more than in the general population of the study (36% compared to 21% in the overall data), X2 (1, N = 228) = 23.26, p < .01. Wanting to express Friendly increased the participants\u2019 probability to select the Hourglass structure, X2 (4, N = 228) = 9.5, p < .05, the Rounded outline X2 (1, N = 228) = 6.43, p < .05, and the White and blue color combination, X2 (2, N = 228) = 8.15, p < .05.

The body of knowledge in human-robot interaction keeps growing to ensure that these robots follow human\u2019 social norms and expectations [10, 11, 51]. However, knowledge is limited regarding the design research of SARs [17, 18]. Most research in the field focuses on evaluating users\u2019 perceptions of existing off-the-shelf SARs [12\u201315]. In this work, we sought to define what these expectations are. Using an online questionnaire, we collected data from 228 respondents regarding their expectations from SARs in four use cases differ in their four layers of context. Results confirm that users have different expectations regarding the robot\u2019s characteristics that are suitable for each context. However, in most cases (excluding COR), the top selected word was Friendly (see Sect. 4.1 and Table 5).\nFurther, when asked to select VQs that best express these expectations, we found that participants\u2019 demographic data significantly affected their selections (see Sect. 4.2 and Table 7). The four final designs (formed by looking at most users\u2019 selections) are almost similar and differ only by the structure; all designs are rounded-edged white robots. Figure 6 presents the four designed robots by use case.\nWe then combined our findings of this study with our previous empirical findings [23] to set up design guidelines to assist designers in creating a new SAR according to its context. Figure 7 presents desired characteristics in each context according to our recent findings; the table on the right presents design suggestions for each characteristic.\nDesigning Robots with the Context 115\nItalic represent a significant level of p < .05; Bold represent a significance level of p < .01.\nFor example, in designing a new service robot for an assisted living residence facility (ALR), designers should inspire for a friendly, inviting, and reliable look; hence, they may consider choosing a rounded, white and blue, a-shaped design.\nThe results align with previous studies that found that design preferences are more related to users\u2019 personal preferences. There is no consensus among users regarding the appropriate appearance for SARs. Hence, specifically for the case of a personal robot (PAR), the design should allowusers tomake adjustments usingmass customization [52]. In addition, these results may indicate that the participatory design of SARs should be done carefully using two-way evaluations, allowing users to express themselves without relying on them to make design decisions. Participatory design outcomes should be assessed with other users using evaluation tools like Microsoft reaction cards [50].\nThis research, however, is subject to several limitations. First, participants were not asked to justify their selections; hence, we could not track their intentions. Second, the participants could only select three VQs: structure, outline, and color, with a closed set\n116 E. Liberman-Pincu et al.\nof options. Therefore, all outcomes share the exact proportions and dimensions. The robot\u2019s height affects user perception [13]; in our previous study evaluating the effect of the COVID-19 officer robot\u2019s appearance, some participants mentioned it should be taller [28]. Our subsequent studies will explore stakeholders\u2019 perceptions as well as the effect of culture. Such findings will provide further support for the design process of new SARs depending on their context of use, their intended role, and users. And form design guidelines for future SARs.\nAcknowledgment.
