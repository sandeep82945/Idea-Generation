    "abstractText": "Purpose: Previous studies are based on social exchange theory to explore the influence of leadership style on employees\u2019 deviant innovation behavior. However, deviant innovation is risky, not supported by the organization, and is expected to benefit the long-term development of the organization. The key to the problem lies in how to guide employees to think and solve problems from the perspective of the organization, instead of just relying on material or spiritual exchange and return. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between coaching leadership, interactional justice, organizational identification and employees\u2019 deviant innovation from the perspective of changing cognition. Methods: This work surveyed employees in 26 Chinese enterprises in more than 10 regions. Questionnaires were distributed to 450 employees, the first round of survey mainly investigated demographic information of employees and coaching leadership style of supervisors, and the second round of survey mainly investigated employees\u2019 organizational identification, interactional justice, and deviant innovation behavior. By tracking and matching, 340 valid questionnaires were finally obtained. Spss 22.0 was used to describe all the study variables; Mplus 7.0 is used to carry out a confirmatory factor analysis and a multi-path regression model. Results: According to self-categorization theory, the results demonstrated that coaching leadership can directly or indirectly promote employees\u2019 deviant innovation behavior through the dual-path intermediary and chain intermediary of interactional fairness and organizational identification. Conclusion: Under the open situation created by coaching leadership, coaching leaders will interact and communicate sincerely with employees, and employees\u2019 cognition will change. The original \u201cI\u201d of employees will be transformed into \u201cbig self\u201d with organizational membership, which will guide employees to show behaviors beneficial to the organization. Therefore, interactional justice and organizational identification can play a key role of the influence of coaching leadership on employees\u2019 deviant innovation behavior.",

However, deviant innovation is risky, not supported by the organization, and is expected to benefit the long-term development of the organization. The key to the problem lies in how to guide employees to think and solve problems from the perspective of the organization, instead of just relying on material or spiritual exchange and return. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between coaching leadership, interactional justice, organizational identification and employees\u2019 deviant innovation from the perspective of changing cognition. Methods: This work surveyed employees in 26 Chinese enterprises in more than 10 regions. Questionnaires were distributed to 450 employees, the first round of survey mainly investigated demographic information of employees and coaching leadership style of supervisors, and the second round of survey mainly investigated employees\u2019 organizational identification, interactional justice, and deviant innovation behavior. By tracking and matching, 340 valid questionnaires were finally obtained. Spss 22.0 was used to describe all the study variables; Mplus 7.0 is used to carry out a confirmatory factor analysis and a multi-path regression model. Results: According to self-categorization theory, the results demonstrated that coaching leadership can directly or indirectly promote employees\u2019 deviant innovation behavior through the dual-path intermediary and chain intermediary of interactional fairness and organizational identification. Conclusion: Under the open situation created by coaching leadership, coaching leaders will interact and communicate sincerely with employees, and employees\u2019 cognition will change. The original \u201cI\u201d of employees will be transformed into \u201cbig self\u201d with organizational membership, which will guide employees to show behaviors beneficial to the organization. Therefore, interactional justice and organizational identification can play a key role of the influence of coaching leadership on employees\u2019 deviant innovation behavior.

In China, Wang et al4 called the former \u201cTo feign action in one place and to make the real move in another\u201d and defined the latter as \u201cA general at the front may even refuse an emperor\u2019s order\u201d. Under the increasing competitive organizational environment, the benefits of deviant innovation to the long-term development of the organization are obvious to all,4\u20137 and appear more and more frequently in the practice of enterprise innovation management,8 and it has aroused the widespread concern of managers and scholars at home and abroad.\nPrevious studies have focused on the influence of leadership style on employees\u2019 deviant innovation behavior. At present, most of the researches based on social exchange theory found that positive leadership style on employees\u2019 deviant innovation behavior has positive effects,9,10 there are also studies based on conservation of resources theory to explore the positive and negative effects of positive and negative leadership styles.11,12 So, are there any other mechanisms of influence other than motivations based on gratitude and feedback or resource support and constraints? According to the definition of deviant innovation, we can find that employees who engage in this kind of behavior do not want leaders or organizations to know beforehand, and the original intention of this kind of behavior is not to reward beforehand, but to do it sincerely for the organization, so it depends more on the initiative and spontaneity of employees, rather than simply relying on the material or spiritual exchange and return. Then are this initiative and spontaneity related to employees\u2019 cognition of the formation of \u201cself in the organization\u201d after the role of leadership style? Therefore, this study is dedicated to exploring the influence mechanism behind deviant innovation behavior from the perspective of changing employees\u2019 cognition, based on self-categorization theory.\nIn the Chinese situation, there is a saying in Sun Tzu\u2019s Art of War: \u201cRegard your soldiers as your children, and they will follow you into the deepest valleys; Look on them as your own beloved sons, and they will stand by you even unto death\u201d. In recent years, coaching leadership has been increasingly concerned and valued by academic circles, it is considered that it can change employees\u2019 cognition adopting the way of guidance.13 On the one hand, coaching leaders play the role of \u201ccoach\u201d in enterprises,14 treat soldiers as infants, have the responsibility to educate employees, change their concepts and stimulate their potential, which we call \u201cEstablishing mentoring relationship\u201d. On the other hand, coaching leaders have four structural elements: authorization, interactive communication, encouragement and inspiration, support and help employees develop,15 love and protect his subordinates, treat them as beloved sons, and provide them with hope and stage, we call them \u201cMaking kinship\u201d. It starts the automatic and spontaneous mechanism for employees to change from \u201cleaders let me do\u201d to \u201cI want to do\u201d.16 This is a change of individual cognitive style. The \u201cI\u201d in an organization is different from the original \u201cself\u201d, but the \u201cI\u201d is socialized by the organization will lead individuals to make behaviors loyal to the organization, which can be explained by self-categorization theory. Just as the Chinese Confucian \u201cXiao Jing\u201d advocates: \u201cWith a son who will dispute him, a father will not fall into unrighteousness. So when there is unrighteousness, then the son must not refrain from disputing his father and the subordinate must not refrain from disputing his lord\u201d. That is to say, \u201cXiao\u201d demands and requires that the son not blindly obey the father, when \u201cministers\u201d practices this obligation, he needs to consider various objective conditions to judge whether he wants to be \u201cloyal\u201d. So, whether before or after the leaders know, Chinese employees will make objective analysis according to the actual situation, have a ruler in their hearts, calmly measure what is best for the company, do not go against the leaders, blindly follow or shirk, and will choose to proceed silently more wisely before the innovation succeeds. Therefore, this study focuses on the influence of coaching leadership on employees\u2019 deviant innovation behavior under the good atmosphere of \u201cEstablishing mentoring relationship and Making kinship\u201d.\nAs pointed out in the Analects of Confucius of Chinese Confucianism:\u201cA ruler in employing his ministers should be guided solely by the prescriptions of ritual. Ministers in serving their ruler, solely by devotion to his cause.\u201d Therefore, based on the self-categorization theory, this study holds that employees\u2019 insistence on implementing hiding innovative ideas beneficial to the organization is inseparable from employees\u2019 association their own organizational membership with self-concept. Among them, 1) This connection belongs to a kind of self-categorization of employees. The core of the cognitive process of self-categorization theory is depersonalization, it is a process in which individuals redefine themselves cognitively, that is, from individual unique natures to shared social categorization membership, from \u201cI\u201d to \u201cwe\u201d.17 And organizational identification can realize this connection.18 Organizational identification is a key psychological state reflecting the potential relationship between employees and organizations, which involves employees\u2019 feeling\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S381968 DovePress Psychology Research and Behavior Management 2022:15 3862\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nof belonging to the organization.19 When employees have a deeper recognition and understanding of the organization\u2019s long-term goals and prospects, they will stick to their innovative behavior even if the leaders are expected to disagree.20 2) The formation of employees\u2019 self-concept requires sincere interaction and open communication between leaders and employees.15 Interactional fairness has been paid more attention in the background of Oriental culture,21 it includes a good attitude in communication between superiors and subordinates and the ability to clearly interpret information related to decision-making.22 Coaching leaders pay attention to information interaction with employees,23 which is conducive to enhancing employees\u2019 sense of Interactional fairness.24 Interactional fairness is considered that it can enhance employees\u2019 enthusiasm for work,21 can better predict individual work behavior.25 3) Organizational identification also needs to be based on sincere communication and interaction. Related research also shows that, coaching leaders focus on shortening the psychological distance between them through positive interaction,23 can improve the relationship between employees and organizations,26 so fair atmosphere will increase perception of identity, and then encourage employees to engage in innovative behavior.27 In view of this, interactional justice and organizational identification may act as a separate intermediary and chain intermediary between coaching leadership and employee deviant innovation.\nTherefore, based on the self-categorization theory, this study constructs a multi-path model of coaching leadership style and employees\u2019 deviant innovation from the perspective of changing employees\u2019 cognition. It further tests whether coaching leadership can really exert its leadership effectiveness in the context of high power distance in China, and studies the formation mechanism of deviant innovation in the context of China. Simultaneously, the self-categorization theory is helpful to explain the self in the organization,28 which can explain how employees perceive and behave towards the organization to a certain extent. It provides an appropriate research perspective for a comprehensive and in-depth understanding of the complex relationship between leadership style and employees\u2019 deviant innovation behavior."

Because innovation is risky, employees often choose not to let their leaders or organizations know before they succeed.4 Of course, employees also know that even if they are discovered by their leaders, they will not be severely blamed, because coaching leaders create a situation that tolerates mistakes.14 Therefore, under the guidance of coaching leadership, employees have sufficient ability and strong willingness to devote time and energy to organizational development, it is a kind of silent dedication that does not care about personal advantages and disadvantages, is unobtrusive and unpretentious, it does not work for fame and fortune, but only for the realization of self-worth and the effectiveness of the organization. After strengthening the value of innovative behavior to the organization, employees often choose to hide their innovative ideas in order to focus on trying them without distraction and interference. Therefore, this study proposes:\nH1: Coaching leadership will promote employees\u2019 deviant innovation behavior.\nPsychology Research and Behavior Management 2022:15 https://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S381968 DovePress 3863\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)"

Accordingly, the following assumptions are put forward:\nH3: Coaching leadership has an indirect positive impact on employees\u2019 deviant innovation behavior through the mediating role of organizational identification."

This study is from the perspective of employees\u2019 perception to investigate the impact of employee perceived leadership style on employees\u2019 deviant innovation, so the coaching leadership style questionnaire is also evaluated by employees. At the same time, because time separation is a method to reduce the bias of common methods,56 this study uses tracing to collect data to verify the causal relationship between variables. Theoretically speaking, tracking research at different time points can better investigate the implementation effect of coaching leadership style. Since innovation can be carried out in all walks of life, in this study, more than 10 cities in China, including central China (Zhengzhou City, Henan Province; Nanchang City, Jiangxi Province), northern China (Beijing; Chifeng City, Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region), western China (Ningxia; Kunming City, Yunnan Province) and eastern China (Shanghai; Fuzhou City, Fujian Province; Guangzhou and Shenzhen City, Guangdong Province), were investigated. One or more enterprises were investigated in each province and city. Finally, this study investigates 26 enterprises in more than 10 regions, among which state-owned enterprises account for 15.4% (4), private enterprises account for 50% (13), Sino-foreign joint ventures account for 15.4% (4) and other types 19.2% (5).\nIn this survey, two rounds of questionnaires were distributed to the same employee at different time points, and the researchers\u2019 alumni, previous graduates of their universities, and human resources managers of school-enterprise cooperation units were contacted as the survey contacts. When the contact person is required to share the questionnaire chain in the two rounds of questionnaires, the contact person clearly explains to the filling person that the survey will only be used for academic research, and no data results will be disclosed to the outside world except researchers. These procedures are consistent with the recommendations of Podsakoff et al56 to reduce the bias of common methods. In the process of filling out the questionnaire, the employees can ask their questions directly to the researcher or contact person, and then the employees can fill them out and submit them by themselves.\nBecause the effect of coaching leadership needs a certain amount of time to show, this study adopts the method of longitudinal follow-up investigation, putting independent variables into the first round of questionnaire survey, and putting intermediary variables and result variables into the second round of the questionnaire survey, with an interval of three months. Considering that the total number of independent variables, intermediary variables and result variables is 27, under normal circumstances, it is more appropriate for the sample size of the questionnaire to be 5\u201310 times the total number of questions. And considering that there may be mismatched invalid questionnaires in the data collection process of the two rounds of questionnaires, we finally distributed as many questionnaires as possible in the first round of questionnaires. In the first round, 450 employee questionnaires were distributed, which involved the demographic information of employees and coaching leadership style of superiors (filled out by employees), and 382 questionnaires were effectively recovered (the effective rate was 84.9%). Three months later, 382 questionnaires were distributed in the second round, which involved employees\u2019 organizational identification, interactional justice, and deviant innovation behavior (the employees who filled out the questionnaires in the previous round continued to fill them out).

Existing research shows that positive leadership style is an important factor to promote employees\u2019 deviant innovation\nhttps://doi.org/10.2147/PRBM.S381968 DovePress Psychology Research and Behavior Management 2022:15 3868\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\nbehavior. For example, authentic leadership through organizational self-esteem and constructive responsibility cognition,20 humble leadership through superior-subordinate relationship and psychological privilege,10 ambidextrous leadership through responsibility perception60 induce employees\u2019 deviant innovation behavior. Coaching leadership, as a leadership style that pays attention to \u201cguiding\u201d, \u201cleading\u201d36 and \u201ctolerating mistakes\u201d,14 can promote the generation of employees\u2019 proactive behaviors, such as in-role behavior, career management behavior, organizational citizenship behavior,16 innovation behavior.61 The essence of deviant innovation is also innovation, which is different from innovation in the concealment of its behavior.3 Wang et al4 inferred leaders\u2019 tolerance for mistakes and the working atmosphere that encourages innovation and autonomy are important driving factors for deviant innovation behavior. The focus of coaching leadership is to change the mental model of employees through guidance, encouragement and empowerment, so that employees can realize the significance of innovation to organizational development, and let employees find innovative solutions to problems independently, not just the perception of responsibility and privilege. This is similar to the old Chinese saying that \u201cit is better to teach people to fish than to give them a fish\u201d. So through the exchange of decision-making information and respectful interpersonal interaction, coaching leaders can achieve the goal and dream link between employees and organizations, and stimulate employees to pursue self-realization to improve the motivation of organizational efficiency. This study studies the coaching leadership under the background of Chinese culture and finds that coaching leadership in western cultural background also has certain applicability in the Chinese situation. To a certain extent, this study also tests the theoretical inference of Wang et al.4\nSecondly, based on self-categorization theory, this study answers how and when coaching leadership can improve employees\u2019 deviant innovation behavior. Because deviant innovation behavior has the characteristics of not explicitly stipulated and not supported by the organization, we do not know whether the Chinese employees who are due to face will choose \u201cdeviant innovation\u201d under the consideration that the leaders do not support or fear that the leaders do not support it. This paper discusses what kind of intermediary mechanism coaching leadership promotes employees\u2019 deviant\nPowered by TCPDF (www.tcpdf.org)\ninnovation behaviors, which is helpful to answer employees\u2019 psychological and behavioral reaction mechanism from the Chinese situation. According to the research, coaching leaders treat employees with courtesy, which will make employees get the necessary information and feel respected in the interpersonal interaction with leaders, increase employees\u2019 sense of justice in interaction, and make employees a deeper understanding of the organization, the \u201cbig self\u201d identity of employees in the organization will emerge, further guide employees\u2019 perception and behavior. In this situation, employees will redefine themselves cognitively, bind themselves closely with the organization, realize the transformation from \u201cI\u201d to \u201cwe\u201d, and increase employees\u2019 sense of organizational identification so that employees can think about problems from the perspective of the organization and make behaviors beneficial to the organization, regardless of whether the organization formally approves or explicitly supports them. This discussion will help to clarify the essence of the influence of coaching leadership on subordinates\u2019 innovative behavior in the Chinese context.\nFinally, this work has extended the theory of self-categorization theory. This study points out that according to the definition of deviant innovation, the key to the problem lies in how to change employees\u2019 cognition, instead of relying solely on material or spiritual exchange and return. Therefore, this is different from most previous studies based on social exchange theory or resource conservation theory, to a certain extent, it provides a perspective on how to change employees\u2019 cognition, and examines the formation mechanism of employees\u2019 deviant innovation behaviors. Based on the employee\u2019s point of view, this study proposes that the employee who engages in this kind of behavior does not want to let the leader or the organization know beforehand, and the original intention of this kind of behavior is not to reward beforehand, but only to sincerely do it for the organization without reward. Therefore, it is closely related to the organizational identity of employees, and employees do not have this strong organizational identity at first, which requires the guidance and sincere communication of leaders to achieve this cognitive change. So, whether employees get the internal information of the organization and are treated sincerely by the leaders is not only beneficial for employees to know the development direction of the organization but also beneficial for employees to combine their organizational membership with their self-concept in cognition, which will make employees more motivated to do meaningful behaviors for the organization without hesitation. Through the change of cognition, the employees show behavior beneficial to the organization, which increases the explanatory power of self-categorization theory to a certain extent."

            "text": "First, We can further explore the unfavorable situations that hinder employees\u2019 deviant innovation. In practice, in fact, the organizational situation created by leaders can be divided into two types according to the degree of openness. In addition to the situation of high fault tolerance, high openness and high care that coaching leaders can create, there are also situations with low fault tolerance, low openness and low care. In the context of low fault tolerance, low openness and low care, most employees think I do my job honestly, and just make no mistakes, I feel that I have no obligation to do things outside my work, such as innovation. For the deviant innovation carried out without telling the leader, If I succeed, the leader or organization may reward me. If it fails, the leader will quarrel with me, and there will be such worries. Moreover, it will not help my salary and development, so I will not do this deviant innovative behavior. Therefore, from practice, it can be inferred that the situation of low fault tolerance rate and low openness is not conducive to employees\u2019 deviant innovation behavior. However, the existing studies pay less attention to the obstacles. Because it is of practical value to dig out the situational factors that hinder employees\u2019 deviant innovation in organizations from a theoretical perspective, it is necessary to further explore the obstacles of unfavorable situational factors to employees\u2019 deviant innovation behavior in theory.\nSecond, It can further explore the internal reasons why employees choose deviant ways to innovate. This may be related to individual characteristics, leadership or team member characteristics, leader-member relationship, teammember relationship, task characteristics, resource allocation mechanism and so on. For the resource allocation mechanism, the current study found that Agile leaders, who have the ability to learn quickly and cope with change, give employees enough resources, which will guide employees to engage in compliant innovative behavior, thus reducing bootlegging behavior.62 Then, will there be different answers for Chinese employees? In view of the way Chinese employees choose innovation, we preliminarily infer that it may be related to resources (for the atmosphere created by supportive leaders, they may not need to inform the leaders and have already obtained resources related to innovation; for unsupported leaders, they may worry that they may not get relevant resources even if the leaders know it), the risk of innovation (even if it is supported, the risk still exists) and Chinese employees individual characteristics (such as love face-saving, do not want to be interchanged and do not like to speak out), etc. So it is considered that when Chinese employees must obtain the necessities resources through a formal application, it is more likely that they may choose an open innovation way. When Chinese employees have obtained the necessary resources for innovation before let others know, they may choose to carry out innovation silently before it succeeds, so as not to worry about the psychological burden caused by the failure. This needs to be further tested by future research.\nFinally, It is necessary to deeply explore whether leaders at all levels are sincerely willing to support employee innovation by scholars who pay attention to deviant innovation in the Chinese context. Generally speaking, when employees have innovative ideas, they are worried that they may encounter such responses as \u201cthe company has many policy restrictions!\u201d \u201cThere is no budget to support your ideas!\u201d \u201cthe top won\u2019t approve\u201d, so employees\u2019 inner worries may be the internal reasons that eventually lead to employees\u2019 choice of deviant innovation. As Pan63 president of Antai, said, the middle managers in the company are the killers of enterprise innovation, grass-roots employees are the source of innovation, because although middle-level cadres are the most important backbone of the company, they are often the most feudal and afraid of change. They may worry that young people may come up with new ideas and replace their positions, which will easily lead to the psychology of \u201cit is good for me to have ideas, but others don\u2019t need them\u201d. So in this case, whether the direct superiors met by employees are really willing to create a good atmosphere to promote deviant innovation behavior needs further discussion. At the same time, how the top management should do to prevent the strangulation of creativity is also worthy of further empirical research."

Based on this logic, this study examines the relationship between coaching leadership style and employees\u2019 deviant innovation and verifies a two-path mediating model, the chain mediation model of interactional justice and organizational identification, which are closely related to employees\u2019 cognition. We hope that the findings of this study will help researchers and practitioners better understand why employees\u2019 deviant innovation behaviors emerge in large numbers in some organizations, however, it is rare in other organizations, and what are the factors and intermediate mechanisms that play a key role in stimulating employees\u2019 deviant innovation behavior, which is helpful for further research on deviant innovation behavior."
