    "abstractText": "Introduction: Filamentous actinomycetes, notably members of the genus Streptomyces, remain a rich source of new specialized metabolites, especially antibiotics. In addition, they are also a valuable source of anticancer and biocontrol agents, biofertilizers, enzymes, immunosuppressive drugs and other biologically active compounds. The new natural products needed for such purposes are now being sought from extreme habitats where harsh environmental conditions select for novel strains with distinctive features, notably an ability to produce specialized metabolites of biotechnological value.",

In addition, they are also a valuable source of anticancer and biocontrol agents, biofertilizers, enzymes, immunosuppressive drugs and other biologically active compounds. The new natural products needed for such purposes are now being sought from extreme habitats where harsh environmental conditions select for novel strains with distinctive features, notably an ability to produce specialized metabolites of biotechnological value.\nMethods: A culture-based bioprospecting strategy was used to isolate and screen filamentous actinomycetes from three poorly studied extreme biomes. Actinomycetes representing different colony types growing on selective media inoculated with environmental suspensions prepared from high-altitude, hyper-arid Atacama Desert soils, a saline soil from India and from a Polish pine forest soil were assigned to taxonomically predictive groups based on characteristic pigments formed on oatmeal agar. One hundred and fifteen representatives of the colour-groups were identified based on 16S rRNA gene sequences to determine whether they belonged to validly named or to putatively novel species. The antimicrobial activity of these isolates was determined using a standard plate assay. They were also tested for their capacity to produce hydrolytic enzymes and compounds known to promote plant growth while representative strains from the pine forest sites were examined to determine their ability to inhibit the growth of fungal and oomycete plant pathogens.\nResults: Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyses on isolates representing the colour-groups and their immediate phylogenetic neighbours showed that most belonged to either rare or novel species that belong to twelve genera. Representative isolates from the three extreme biomes showed different patterns of taxonomic diversity and characteristic bioactivity profiles. Many of the isolates produced bioactive compounds that inhibited the growth of one or more strains from a panel of nine wild strains in standard antimicrobial assays and are known to promote plant growth. Actinomycetes from the litter and mineral horizons of the pine forest, including acidotolerant and acidophilic strains belonging to the genera Actinacidiphila, Streptacidiphilus and Streptomyces, showed a remarkable ability to inhibit the growth of diverse fungal and oomycete plant pathogens.\nDiscussion: It can be concluded that selective isolation and characterization of dereplicated filamentous actinomyctes from several extreme biomes is a practical way of generating high quality actinomycete strain libraries for agricultural, industrial and medical biotechnology.\nKEYWORDS\nactinomycetes, systematics, antimicrobial activity, fungal phytopathogens, human pathogens, plant growth promoting bacteria, biocontrol agents\nTYPE Original Research PUBLISHED 19 January 2023 DOI 10.3389/fmicb.2022.1054384"

            "text": "The phylum Actinomycetota (Oren and Garrity, 2021), formerly Actinobacteria sensu Goodfellow (2012), encompasses actinomycetes that are common in natural habitats where they have a major role in recycling organic matter (Bhatti et\u00a0al., 2017) and in the transformation of environmental pollutants, such as pesticides (Alvarez et\u00a0al., 2017). However, actinomycetes are known best for their unique ability to synthesise new specialised (secondary) metabolites, notably clinically significant antibiotics (Newman and Cragg, 2020; De Simeis and Serra, 2021). A new generation of antibiotics are urgently needed to control multi-drug resistant microbial pathogens which are causing a global health crisis (World Health Organization, 2021).\nAround 70% of known antibiotics are produced by filamentous actinomycetes, notably by members of the genus Streptomyces (S\u00e1nchezSu\u00e1rez et\u00a0al., 2020; Donald et\u00a0al., 2022), the type genus of the family Streptomycetaceae Waksman and Henrici, 1943. Streptomycetes remain a rich source of new specialised metabolites, especially antibiotics (Sivalingam et\u00a0al., 2019; Lacey and Rutledge, 2022) with the promise of more to come now that improved analytical procedures, such as genome mining and genetic engineering, are opening up new opportunities for drug discovery (Luo et\u00a0al., 2014; Atanasov et\u00a0al., 2021). However, the search for new natural products from streptomycetes using culturedependent strategies needs to be\u00a0tailored to meet developments in their ecology and systematics (Nouioui et\u00a0al., 2018; Traxler and Rozen, 2022; Wang et\u00a0 al., 2022), as shown by the transfer of validly named acidotolerant and acidophilic Streptomyces species to the genera Actinacidiphila, Streptantibioticus and Wenjunlia whilst some Streptacidiphilus species have been moved to form the new genera Peterkaempfera and Phaeacidiphilus (Madhaiyan et\u00a0al., 2022). Members of these poorly studied taxa are promising sources of new bioactive compounds (Goli\u0144ska et\u00a0 al., 2023), as are Kitasatospora strains (Takahashi, 2017) which also belong to the family Streptomycetaceae.\nIn addition to therapeutic antibiotics, filamentous actinomycetes, including streptomycetes, are a valuable source of anticancer and biocontrol agents, biofertilizers, enzymes, immunosuppressive drugs and other biologically active compounds (Mukhtar et\u00a0 al., 2017; Sivalingam et\u00a0al., 2019; Pacios-Michelena et\u00a0al., 2021; Boukhatem et\u00a0al., 2022). The new natural products needed for such purposes are now being sought from extreme habitats as harsh environmental conditions therein select for novel strains with distinctive genetic and molecular features, notably an ability to produce specialised metabolites of biotechnological value (Bull and Goodfellow, 2019; Sayed et\u00a0al., 2020; Wilson and Brimble, 2021).\nIn practice, novel actinomycetes, especially streptomycetes, from extreme biomes are proving to be\u00a0an especially rich source of new antibiotics, as shown by strains isolated from desert soils (Rateb et\u00a0al., 2018; Djinni et\u00a0al., 2019; Sun et\u00a0al., 2022), deep-sea sediments (Nweze et\u00a0al., 2020; Jagannathan et\u00a0al., 2021) and marine organisms (Chen et\u00a0al., 2021) whereas ones with growth promoting traits are being used to mitigate the effect of drought on crop plants (Chukwuneme et\u00a0al., 2020). The extension of such studies to neglected extreme ecosystems can be\u00a0expected to build upon these developments as biome type and geographical location are known to influence the composition of actinomycete communities (Charlop-Powers et\u00a0al., 2015; Hernandez et\u00a0al., 2021), not least with respect to streptomycetes (Andam et\u00a0al., 2016; Arocha-Garza et\u00a0al., 2017; Aallam et\u00a0al., 2021). It is therefore timely to explore the taxonomic diversity and biotechnological potential of poorly studied actinomycetes from litter and mineral\nhorizons of coniferous forests (Goli\u0144ska et\u00a0al., 2023) and from saline soils (Zhao et\u00a0al., 2016). Improved bioinformatic tools for recognising prokaryotic species boundaries (Meier-Kolthoff et\u00a0al., 2013; Sant'Anna et\u00a0al., 2019) are bringing greater precision to bioprospecting campaigns, as are dereplication procedures designed to select representative isolates from extensive strain libraries for biotechnological purposes (Goodfellow et\u00a0al., 2018).\nSearch and discovery campaigns intended to recover actinomycetes of potential biotechnological significance from extreme habitats are generally focused on the selective isolation, preliminary characterisation and antimicrobial screening of small numbers of isolates from individual biomes (Liu et\u00a0al., 2016; Priyadarshini et\u00a0al., 2016; Meklat et\u00a0al., 2020). This partly reflects a tension between the need to screen representative isolates for new metabolites and the requirement to classify them using taxonomic methods that are difficult to apply to more than a few strains. This problem is being addressed by using dereplication procedures, such as MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry (Schumann and Maier, 2014), molecular fingerprinting (Carro et\u00a0al., 2018) and genus specific primers (Castro et\u00a0al., 2019), to distribute large numbers of isolates to taxonomically meaningful groups, representatives of which can be\u00a0 selected for further study. A practical and inexpensive way of dereplicating streptomycetes was introduced by Williams et\u00a0al. (1969) who assigned large numbers of soil streptomycetes to colour-groups based on aerial spore mass, substrate mycelial and diffusible pigment colours formed on oatmeal agar and melanin pigments produced on peptone-yeast extract \u2013 iron agar. Subsequently, the number of colour-groups were used as an index of streptomycete diversity in diverse natural habitats (Atalan et\u00a0al., 2000; Sembiring et\u00a0al., 2000; Antony-Babu et\u00a0al., 2010) following the discovery that representatives of such groups belonged to validly named or novel (previously unknown) Streptomyces species or species-groups based upon genotypic and phenotypic criteria (Manfio et\u00a0al., 2003; Goodfellow et\u00a0al., 2007), as exemplified by members of what became known as the Streptomyces violaceusniger clade (Sembiring et\u00a0 al., 2000; Goodfellow et\u00a0al., 2007. Kusuma et\u00a0al., 2021). Representatives of this taxon show a similar pattern of HPLC detected antibiotics (Ward and Goodfellow, 2014). Recently, principal component analyses of members of colourgroups composed of desert filamentous actinomycetes were shown to be\u00a0positively correlated with corresponding levels of bioactivity recorded from antimicrobial assays (Goodfellow et\u00a0al., 2018). The colour-group strategy has been extended to include representatives of other genera containing filamentous actinomycetes (Idris, 2016; Kusuma, 2020).\nIn the present study, filamentous actinomycetes isolated from hyper-arid, high altitude Atacama Desert soils, a saline soil and from two pine forest locations were assigned to colour-groups in order to gain an insight into the generic diversity at each of the sampling sites. 16S rRNA gene sequencing analyses were carried out on representatives of the colour-groups to determine whether they belonged to validly named species or to putatively new species and the resultant phylogenetic data used to establish the taxonomic identity of isolates assigned to the colour-groups. The antimicrobial activity of colourgroup representatives was determined using a standard plate assay, as was their ability to produce hydrolytic enzymes and compounds known to promote plant growth. In addition, representative strains from the pine forest sites were examined to determine their ability to inhibit the growth of fungal and oomycete plant pathogens. The overall aim of the study was to compare and contrast the taxonomic and functional activities of representative isolates from the four sampling sites and to generate a high quality strain library for agricultural, medical and industrial biotechnology.\n\u015awiecimska et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.1054384\nFrontiers in Microbiology 03 frontiersin.org"

Tenfold dilutions of the Atacama Desert soil samples were used to inoculate starch-casein agar (SCA; K\u00fcster and Williams, 1964), humic acid-vitamin agar (HA; Hayakawa and Nonomura, 1987), Gauze\u2019s no. 1 agar (G; Zakharova et\u00a0al., 2003) and R2A agar (Becto-Dickinson, United State) plates which were incubated at 28\u00b0C for 21 days. The pH of the Atacama soil samples ranged from 6.6 to 7.6, the organic matter content from 1.7% to 3.7%, the moisture content was zero %.\nIn total, the 226 representative actinomycetes consisted of 59 isolates from the hyper-arid Atacama Desert soils and 16 from the saline soil, including 3 classified as Streptomyces alkaliterrae by \u015awiecimska et\u00a0al. (2020). Similarly 151 isolates from the litter and mineral layers of the pine forest soils comprised 65 and 86 strains from the northern and southern slopes of the inland dune system supporting pine, including pairs of strains classified as Catenulispora pinisilvae (\u015awiecimska et\u00a0al., 2021a) and Catenulispora pinistramenti (\u015awiecimska et\u00a0al., 2021b). The isolates from the desert soils included 6 classified as either Modestobacter altitudinis (Goli\u0144ska et\u00a0al., 2020a) or Modestobacter excelsi (Goli\u0144ska et\u00a0 al., 2020b) and the type strain of Micromonosporra acroterricola (Carro et\u00a0al., 2019). Isolates were taken from the selective isolation plates based on characteristic colonial properties. Isolates from the Atacama Desert soils were maintained on slopes of modified Bennett\u2019s agar (Jones, 1949), ones from the saline soil on halophilic nutrient agar (Atlas, 2010) and those from the pine forest sites on SCA slopes, at room temperature and as suspensions of spores and mycelial fragments or as rods and cocci in 20%, v/v glycerol at \u221280\u00b0C."

Amplification of 16S rRNA genes was performed using standard forward (27f: AGAGTTTGATCCTGGCTCAG) and reverse (1525r, AAGGAGGTGATCCAGCC) primers (Lane, 1991) under the following conditions (25 \u03bcL volume): 2x MyFi Mix (Bioline, United\u00a0Kingdom) which contained DNA polymerase, dNTPs, MgCl2 (at optimised concentrations), and 1 \u03bcL of each primer (20 \u03bcM), 1 \u03bcL of 200 ng DNA and sterile distilled water; the negative control was sterile distilled water and the positive one DNA isolated from Actinospica durhamensis DSM 46820T.

The resultant preparations were sequenced on an ABI 3730xl Genetic Instrument (Applied Biosystems, Thermo Fisher Scientific United State) at the Institute of Biochemistry and Biophysics of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw using the same pair of primers, as given above. Almost complete 16S rRNA gene sequences of the isolates were identified using a combination of two sequence similarity search engines (blast and megablast; Altschul et\u00a0al., 1997), followed by rigorous pairwise global sequence alignment (Myers and Miller, 1988), as previously described (Chun et\u00a0al., 2007), as implemented through the EzBioCloud web server1 (Yoon et\u00a0al., 2017). Isolates showing 16S rRNA gene sequences equal to or <99.0% (maximum probability of error 1.0%) with their immediate phylogenetic neighbours were considered to belong to putatively new species (MeierKolthoff et\u00a0al., 2013)."

The pine forest isolates were tested for their ability to inhibit the growth of fungal and oomycete plant pathogens using the co-culture method, as described by \u015awiecimska et\u00a0al. (2021a, 2022). To this end, the isolates were streaked on the right side of Petri plates of potato dextrose agar (PDA, Becton Dickinson, United State) and incubated for 2 weeks at 28\u00b0C. These preparations were inoculated at the opposite side of the Petri plates with the agar plugs (\u00f8 = 8 mm). The pathogenic fungi and oomycetes, namely Phytophthora cactorum, Phytophthora cryptogea, Phytophthora megasperma and Phytophthora plurivora, were grown on PDA for 7\u201321 days at 28\u00b0C. The co-cultures were incubated for 7 days in the case of those involving Alternaria alternata IOR 1783 (isolated from kohlrabi), Fusarium culmorum IOR 2333 (isolated from a pine root), Fusarium culmorum D (isolated from wheat), Phytophthora plurivora IOR 2303 (isolated from oak rhizosphere), Rhizoctonia solani 13 (isolated from a pine root) and Sclerotina sclerotiorum IOR 2242 (isolated from broccoli); for 14 days with respect to those involving Botritis cinerea IOR 1873 (isolated from tomato), Colletotrichum acutatum IOR 2153 (isolated from blueberry), Fusarium oxysporum IOR 342 (isolated from pine), Fusarium poae A and Fusarium tricinctum A (isolated from wheat) and Phytophthora cactorum IOR 1925 (isolated from strawberry), and for 21 days in corresponding preparations involving Fusarium graminearum A and Fusarium oxysporum D (isolated from wheat), Fusarium solani IOR 825 (isolated from parsley), Phytophthora cryptogea IOR 2080 (isolated from Lawson cypress), Phytophthora megasperma IOR 404 (isolated from raspberry), and Phoma lingam IOR 2284 (isolated from rape). All of the tests were carried out in triplicate at 28\u00b0C. Activity against Chalara fraxinea (isolate from ash)\nwas tested using the same procedure, but on malt extract agar (MEA; 20 g L\u22121, malt extract, 15 g L\u22121 agar; Kowalski, 2006) with incubation for 8 weeks at room temperature. The negative controls were cultures of the fungal and oomycete pathogens grown under the same incubation conditions. Inhibition (I) of pathogen growth was calculated using the formula: I\u00a0(%) = (C-T/C) \u00d7 100, where C is the diameter of pathogen growth in the control sample and T the diameter of pathogen growth in each of the co-culture samples. Data obtained from in vitro experiments were reported as mean values \u00b1 standard deviations (SD)."

            "text": "The representative isolates were tested, in triplicate, for their ability to produce ammonia, indol-3-acetic acid (IAA) and hydrogen cyanide (HCN) using ISP2 medium (broth and agar, respectively; Shirling and Gottlieb, 1966), at pH 5.5 and 7.5, as the basal media for the isolates representing the desert and pine forest colour-groups, respectively, whereas halophilic nutrient broth (Atlas, 2010), pH 8.0, supplemented with 3% sodium chloride was the basal medium used for the representatives of the colour-groups containing strains from the saline soil.\nAll of the isolates were examined for their ability to produce ammonia using the modified method described by Cappucino and Sherman (1992) and the basal media supplemented with L-tryptophan (5 mg mL\u22121); flasks containing the inoculated media were shaken (150 rpm) for 14\u201321 days at 28\u00b0C then centrifuged (10,000 rpm for 10 min). One mL of each of the resultant supernatants was mixed with 0.5 mL of Nessler\u2019s reagent; the development of a yellow to brown colour indicated that ammonia had been formed. Similarly, the production of IAA was detected using the modified method described by Brick et\u00a0al. (1991); the inoculated basal broth cultures supplemented with L-tryptophan (5 mg mL\u22121) were shaken (150 rpm) for 14\u201321 days at 28\u00b0C, centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min and aliquots of the supernatants (50 \u03bcL) mixed with 100 \u03bcL Salkowski reagent (49 mL of 35% perchloric acid and 1 mL of 0.5 M FeCl3 solution) and the preparations incubated in the dark for 30 min. The development of a pink colour in the resultant preparations indicated the presence of IAA; the negative control consisted of the corresponding growth media mixed with Salkowski reagent.\nThe isolates were also examined for their ability to solubilise phosphate using a medium containing 10 g glucose, 0.5 g NH4SO4, 0.8 g K2HPO4, 0.2 g KH2PO4, 0.2 g NaCl, 0.1 g KCl, 0.3 g MgSO4 \u00b7 7H2O, 2 g yeast extract, 2.5 g Ca3(PO4)2, 0.5 g arabic gum and 20 g agar; the arabic gum was used to keep the Ca3(PO4)2 in suspension. The width of colonies and hydrolysis zones were measured in millimetres after 14 days of incubation at 28\u00b0C and activity indices calculated as follows: Wact = Sh2 (Sc \u00d7 t) where Sh indicates the diameter of the hydrolysis zone, Sc the colony diameter and t the time of incubation (Hrynkiewicz et\u00a0al., 2010).\nThe production of HCN was determined after Lock (1948). The isolates were grown on slopes of the basal agar media supplemented with glycine (4.4 g L\u22121) and the inoculated tubes incubated for 7 days at 28\u00b0C when Whatman filter paper (Merck) strips soaked with 2% sodium carbonate in 0.5% picric acid solution were inserted into the neck of the tubes; the latter were sealed with parafilm and incubated in the dark for 14 days at 28\u00b0C. A colour change on the paper strips from yellow to brown indicated that HCN had been produced. Similarly, the ability of the isolates to synthesis siderophores was established using the method of Alexander and Zuberer (1991); the isolates were inoculated onto\n\u015awiecimska et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.1054384\nFrontiers in Microbiology 05 frontiersin.org\nChrome Azurol S (CAS) medium and incubated at 28\u00b0C for 14 days. A colour change in the media from blue to orange under and around the colonies indicated the presence of siderophores; the resultant activity indices were estimated, as described above. Both of these tests were conducted three times."

Strains isolated from the desert, pine forest and saline environmental samples were grown on dedicated media, given below, at pH 7.5, 6.5, and 7.5, respectively. In all cases the isolates were inoculated at the centre of the agar plates; the latter were incubated for 14 days at 28\u00b0C when the width of hydrolysis zones around colonies were measured and coefficients of activity determined, as described above. The ability of the isolates to produce cellulases and chitinases were determined according to Berg and Pettersson (1977) and Lingappa and Lockwood (1962), respectively. The production of cellulases was established by flooding incubated plates with a 0.1% solution of Congo red for 15 min and then with 1 M NaCl for 15 min; hydrolysis zones appeared as orange haloes against a red background. Lipolytic and pectinolytic activities were determined using procedures described by Gibson and Gordon (1974) and Strzelczyk and Szpota\u0144ski (1989), respectively. Hydrolysis of pectin was detected by flooding incubated plates with 10% Cetrimide solution for 15 min; zones of clearing around colonies indicated positive results. Proteolytic activity was tested on a medium containing 5 g powdered skimmed milk, 0.1 g (NH4)2SO4, 0.1 g FeSO4 \u00b7 7H2O, 0.1 g yeast extract and 15 g agar. Clear zones around colonies were recorded as activity indices. Finally, urease activity was detected after Tidwell et\u00a0al. (1955); changes in the colour of the medium from yellow to orange-pink were recorded as positive results. All tests for synthesis of hydrolytic enzymes were performed in triplicate."

Colourgroup\u00a01, one of the two largest taxa, consisted of isolates that exhibited a medium grey aerial spore mass and a moderate yellow green substrate mycelium. The 16 isolates from the saline soil fell into 4 single-and 4 multimembered colour-groups with between 2 and 5 strains, all but one of which included isolates which produced characteristic diffusible pigments (Supplementary Table S1B); none of the isolates formed melanin pigments. The largest taxon, colour-group\u00a0 1, included isolates which formed a distinctive moderate yellow substrate mycelium and a characteristic pale purple diffusible pigment, but not aerial hyphae. The most extensive\ntaxonomic variation was found amongst the 65 strains isolated from the northern slope of the inland pine dune. These isolates were assigned to 7 single-and 14 multi-membered colour-groups with between 2 and 9 strains all of which formed aerial hyphae, apart from isolates belonging to the first colour-group; many of these isolates produced characteristic diffusible pigments, as shown Supplementary Table S1C. Similarly, the 86 isolates from the southern inland pine dune fell into 6 single-and 12 multimembered colour-groups with between 2 and 24 strains, all of which formed aerial hyphae (Supplementary Table S1D). Colour-group\u00a01, the largest taxon, consisted of 24 isolates with distinctive features, a moderate yellow green aerial spore mass, brilliant greenish yellow substrate mycelia and brilliant yellow green diffusible pigments. Only two strains produced melanin pigments on PYEA, namely isolates NL30 and SL26 from the northern and southern sampling sites in the pine forest."

Codes for the isolates from the Atacama Desert soils: numbers 1\u20135 at the beginning of the code indicate the sample sites, G, HA, R2A, SCA the isolation medium and then the isolate number. Codes: NA, NL, NF and NH/SA, SL, SF and SH refer to isolates from the mineral, litter, fermentation and humus layers of the northern and southern slopes of the inland dune of the pine forest.

Several of the Atacama Desert isolates can be\u00a0considered to represent putatively novel species, as shown by relationships between isolates 2SCA1, 3G5, 4SCA5, and 2G9 and the type strains of their close phylogenetic neighbours, namely Kribbella turkmenica (98.94% sequence similarity), Pseudonocardia xinjiangensis (97.81% sequence similarity), Streptomyces camponoticapitis (97.58% sequence similarity) and Streptomyces paradoxus (98.79% sequence similarity), respectively.\nUsing the approach outlined above isolates from the saline soil fell into two genera, Nocadiopsis (colour-groups 4 to 6 and 8) and Streptomyces (colour-groups 1 to 3 and 7). Isolates OF4 and OF6 (colour-group\u00a04) can be\u00a0provisionally identified as N. metallicus as they shared identical or almost identical 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities with the type strain of this species. In contrast, isolates IT2 and IF12, which represent single-membered colour-groups 6 and 5, are putatively novel Nocardiopsis species as they show sequence similarities of 97.45% and 98.72% with the type strains of Nocardiopsis flavescens and Nocardiopsis halotolerans, respectively. Similarly, isolate IF7 from colour-group\u00a03 shared a 97.24% sequence similarity with Streptomyces cahuitamycinicus 13K301T. The two largest taxa, colour-groups 1 and 2, were composed of isolates which were found to have identical or very high sequence similarities with type strains of Streptomyces alkaliterrae and Streptomyces alkaliphilus, respectively.\nThe most pronounced taxonomic variation was found amongst the isolates from the litter and mineral layers of the northern slope of the inland pine dune. Following the procedure described above, colourgroups 7, 8, and 11 contain Actinacidiphila strains, colour-groups 4, 5, 13, 18, 19, and 21 Streptomyces strains whereas those in colour-groups 2 and 10 belong to the genus Kitasatospora. Similarly, isolates comprising colour-groups 1, 6, 12, 14, 15, 16, 17, and 20 can be\u00a0 considered to be\u00a0members of the genus Streptacidiphilus and those forming colourgroup\u00a09 members of the genus Pilimelia. It is especially interesting that colour-group\u00a0 3 encompasses nine isolates assigned to the genus Catenulispora, including the type strains of C. pinisilvae and C. pinistramenti. Several isolates, namely NA4, NL15, and NA21, can be\u00a0considered as putatively novel species given low sequence similarities with their immediate phylogenetic neighbours, namely Streptacidiphilus albus NBRC 100918T (97.73%), Streptacidiphilus carbonis DSM 41754T (98.44%) and Streptacidiphilis hamsterleyensis (92.01%). Similarly, isolates NH28a, NL16, NL23, NF27, and NH28 are prospective novel species that are most closely related to the type strains of Actinacidiphila alni (98.50%), Actinacidiphila bryophytorum (98.48%), Actinacidiphila paucisporea (98.62%), Actinacidiphila yanglinensis (98.14%) and Streptomyces paludis (98.13%), respectively. Isolate NH17 shows a very low sequence similarity (92.32%) with its nearest neighbour, Streptomyces luteireticuli NBRC 13422T, suggesting that it may belong to a novel genus.\nA different pattern of taxonomic diversity was found with strains from the litter and mineral horizons on the southern slope of the inland pine dune. Once again, many of the taxa contained isolates associated with the genus Streptomyces, as witnessed by colour-groups 1, 3, 4, 12, 13, 14, 15, 17, and 18 whereas those assigned to colour-groups 7, 8, 10, and 11 contained Actinacidiphila strains. Further, most, if not all, of the isolates comprising colour-groups 2 and 5 were closely related to the genus Pilimelia whereas those assigned to colour-groups 9 and 16 can be\u00a0considered to be\u00a0Nocardia and Streptacidiphilus strains, respectively. Several strains were found to belong to putative novel species, as exemplified by isolates SL52, SL13, SL5, SA10, SF9, SF13, and SL54, which shared low sequence similarities with the type strains of\nA. bryophytorum (98.61%), Actinacidiphila rubida (97.49%), A. yanglinensis (98.70%), Actinospica acidiphila (98.07%), Nocardia nova (98.85%), Nocardia vinacea (98.22%) and Streptomyces ferralitis (97.65%), respectively. Isolates related to the type strains of A. bryophytorum, A. yanglinensis, P. columellifera subspecies pallida, Streptacidiphilus torunensis, Streptomyces atratus and S. celluloflavus were also isolated from the northern inland pine dune."

            "text": "Seventy-nine of the 115 isolates (69%) representing the colourgroups were active against at least one of the reference strains in the antimicrobial screening assay (Tables 2, 3). Those from the Atacama Desert soils were more active following growth on ISP3 than on ISP2 agar whereas the isolates from the saline soil showed more activity when grown on HA than on ISP3 agar. In contrast, the isolates from the pine forest soils tended to show similar patterns of activity irrespective of whether they were cultivated on ISP2 or ISP3 agar. Only strains from the pine forest soils inhibited the growth of the K. pneumoniae and P. mirabilis strains; they also showed more activity against C. albicans ATCC 10231 than those from the other sampling sites.\nTable\u00a02A shows that the Atacama Desert isolates were most active against the Gram-positive reference strains. In contrast, only isolate 1SCA19, which is most closely related to Streptomyces purpurascens NBRC 13077T (sequence similarity 99.15%), and isolates 5R2A3 and 1SCA21 inhibited the growth of the E. coli and C. albicans strains following cultivation on ISP2 agar. The most pronounced activity was shown by isolates 2G9, 3HA10, and 1SCA19 which are, in turn, most closely related to Streptomyces paradoxus NBRC 14887T (98.79% sequence similarity), Streptomyces galbus DSM 40089T (99.37% sequence similarity) and the type strain of Streptomyces purpurascens (99.15% sequence similarity), respectively. Twelve of the isolates from the hyperarid Atacama Desert soils, namely ones belonging to the genera Kribbella (isolates 2G7 and 2SCA1), Modestobacter (isolates 1G4T, 1G51, 1G52, and 1G14), Pseudonocardia (isolates 1HA3, 2R2A4, and 3G5) and Streptomyces (isolates 1R2A7, 3G6, and 1R2A1) did not inhibit the growth of any of the reference strains.\nThe most active strains from the northern slope of the inland pine dune were found to inhibit the growth of the C. albicans, E. coli, M. luteus and S. infantis reference strains. Isolates NA10a, NA24, NH7, NH17, NH28, and NL21 were particularly active against C. albicans ATCC 10231 and M. luteus ATCC 10240 (inhibition zones 3.0\u201315.0 mm; Table\u00a02B); isolates NA10a and NH7, and NA24 and NL21 were most closely related to the type strains of S. celluloflavus and S. xanthochormogenes, respectively, whereas isolates NH17 and NH28 are members of putatively novel Streptomyces species (Table\u00a01). Other strains showing activity against the C. albicans strain (inhibition zones 2.0\u201315.0 mm) were isolates NA4, NA21, prospective members of novel Streptacidiphilus species, isolate NH22, which shares a 99.78% sequence similarity with Streptacidiphilus neutrinimicus DSM 41755T, and NL23, a prospective novel Actinacidiphila isolates most closely related to A. paucisporea CGMCC 4.2025T. Similarly, C. pinisilvae NH11T and isolate NH28a, which are also members of putatively novel Actinacidiphila and Streptomyces species, respectively, showed pronounced activity against the M. luteus strain; isolate NH28a also inhibited the growth of the S. infantis strain following growth on ISP2 agar, as did isolate NA21, a representative of a prospective novel Streptacidiphilus species.\n\u015aw iecim ska et al. 10 .3 3 8 9 /fm icb .2 0 2 2 .10 54 3 8 4 Fro n tie rs in M icro b io lo g y 10 fro n tie rsin .o rg TABLE\u00a02 Antimicrobial activity of representative actinomycetes isolated from the Atacama Desert and pine forest soils using a standard plug assay.

Eleven isolates inhibited the growth of E. coli PCM 2057 following cultivation on one or both of the cultivation media, namely isolates NA10a, NA21, NH7, and NH17 mentioned above, C. pinistramenti NL8T, and isolates NF22, NH22, NF39, and NH16, which are most closely related to the type strains of S. hamsterleyensis, S. neutrinimicus, K. herbaricolor and S. atratus, respectively, and isolates NL16 and NL23, prospective members of novel Actinacidiphila species (Table\u00a01). Five strains inhibited the growth of K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 following growth on ISP2 agar, namely isolate NA21 mentioned above, isolates NH21 and NL21, which share sequence similarities of 99.07% and 99.93% with A. yanglinensis 1307T and S. xanthochromogenes, NRRL B-5410T, respectively, and isolates NL15 and NH28, presumptive members of novel Streptacidiphilus and Streptomyces species, respectively. Nine isolates inhibited the growth of B. subtilis PCM 2021, as shown in Table\u00a02B. In contrast, the 11 isolates which did not inhibit the growth of any of the reference strains were members of the genera Actinacidiphila (isolate NF27), Catenulispora (isolates NF23 and NL13), Streptacidiphilus (isolates NA19a, NF10, NF20, and NH14) and Streptomyces (isolates NH5, NH15, NL3, and NL35).\nThe isolates from the corresponding southern slope of the pine forest exhibited a different pattern of activity to their counterparts from the northern slope (Table\u00a02). Thirteen isolates, for instance, inhibited the growth of the S. aureus PCM 2054, namely isolate SF17, a close relative of A. yanglinensis 1307T, isolates SA4, SF15, and SL4, which showed their highest sequence similarities with P. columellifera subsp. pallida MB-SK8T, isolates SA7, SF4, SF8, and SH11, close relatives of S. celluloflavus NRRL B-2493T, isolates SL5, SL7, SL10, and SL22, which are prospective novel members of Actinacidiphila species, and isolate SL55, a prospective member of a novel Pilimelia species (Table\u00a01D) following growth on ISP2 and ISP3 media. Eleven isolates inhibited the growth of the M. luteus reference strain, namely isolates SA7, SF8, SH11,\nSL3, SL5, SL7, SL10, and SL22 mentioned above, isolate SH15, a close relative of S. celluloflavus NRRL B-2493T and isolates SH56 and SH57 which are close to Streptomyces cocklensis BK 168T and Streptomyces halstedii NBRC 12783T, as shown in Table\u00a01. Bacillus subtilis PCM 2021 was inhibited by isolates SF15, SH15, SL5, SL7, SL22, and SL55 mentioned above whereas S. infantis SES was inhibited by isolates SA7, SF8, and SH56 mentioned earlier, and isolate SH24, a close relative of P. columellifera subspecies pallida (inhibition zones ranging from 2.0 to 8.0 mm) following growth on ISP2 and ISP3 agar.\nMany of the isolates from the southern slope of the pine forest dune inhibited the growth of the Gram-negative reference strains. Fifteen of them were active against K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 (43%), the corresponding numbers for E. coli PCM 2057, S. infantis SES, P. mirabilis CM NCU and P. aeruginosa ATCC 10145 were found to be\u00a012 (34%), 11 (31%), 8 (23%), and 7 (20%), respectively. Four of the eight isolates shown to be\u00a0 closely related to P. columellifera subspecies pallida MB-SK8T (isolates SA4, SF15, SH24, and SL24) inhibited the growth of the E. coli strain (inhibition zones 4.0\u20137.0 mm), as did S. pinistramenti SF28T, isolate SL10, a prospective member of a new Actinacidiphila species most closely related to the type strain of A. yanglinensis and isolate SL55, a prospective member of a novel Pilimelia species. Similarly, four of the six isolates closely related to S. celluloflavus NRRL B-2493T (isolates SA7, SF8, SH11, and SL3) suppressed the growth of the E. coli strain (inhibition zones 2.0\u20135.0 mm) following growth on both cultivation media whilst isolate SH15, one of the two remaining S. celluloflavus isolates, showed similar activity following growth on ISP3 agar.\nFive of the 15 isolates cultivated on ISP2 or ISP3 that were active against K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603 were close relatives of either P. columellifera subspecies pallida MB-SK8T (isolates SA4 and SF15) or S. celluloflavus NRRL B-2493T (isolates SA7, SF8, and SH11). The 10 isolates which inhibited the growth of this reference strain following growth on either ISP2 or ISP3 agar were isolates SH24 and SL24, and SF4 and SH15, close relatives of the type strains of P. columellifera subspecies pallida and S. celluloflavus, respectively, S. pinistramenti SF28T, isolates\nTABLE\u00a03 Antimicrobial activity of isolates from the saline soil adjacent to Lake Lonar using a standard plug assay.\nStrain B. subtilis PCM 2021\nM. luteus ATCC 10240\nP. aeruginosa ATCC 10145 S. infantis (SES) C. albicans ATCC 10231\nHA ISP3 HA ISP3 HA ISP3 HA ISP3 HA ISP3\nIF7 \u2013 \u2013 5.3 \u00b1 0.6 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nIF11 \u2013 \u2013 2.3 \u00b1 2.1 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nIF15 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 2.0* \u00b10.0 \u2013 \u2013\nIT2 3.0 \u00b1 0.0 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nOF1T \u2013 \u2013 8.3 \u00b1 0.6 \u2013 2.0 \u00b1 0.0 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 2.0 \u00b1 0.0 \u2013\nOF2 \u2013 \u2013 2.7 \u00b1 2.5 13.0 \u00b1 0.0 2.3 \u00b1 0.6 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 2.0 \u00b1 0.0 \u2013\nOF3 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 14.0 \u00b1 0.0 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 2.7 \u00b1 0.6 \u2013\nOF5 \u2013 \u2013 5.0 \u00b1 0.0 \u2013 4.0 \u00b1 0.0 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 2.7 \u00b1 0.6 \u2013\nOF6 \u2013 \u2013 4.0 \u00b1 0.0 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nOF7 \u2013 \u2013 17.3 \u00b1 0.6 12.0 \u00b1 0.0 3.0 \u00b1 0.0 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 2.0 \u00b1 0.0 4.0 \u00b1 0.0\nOF8 \u2013 \u2013 15.7 \u00b1 0.6 11.0 \u00b1 0.0 2.0 \u00b1 0.0 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 3.0 \u00b1 0.0 \u2013\nOT1 \u2013 \u2013 4.3 \u00b1 1.2 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\nInhibition zones of growth were measured in mm, the values are the mean of three replicates \u00b1 standard deviations. \u2013, no inhibition; *isolates showing poor growth; Isolates IF12, IF17, IF19, and OF4 did not inhibit the growth of any of the strains.

Similarly, the eight strains that inhibited the growth of P. mirabilis CM NCU included five related to the type strains of P. columellifera subspecies pallida (isolates SA4 and SH24) and S. celluloflavus (isolates SH11, SH15, and SL3), isolate SF13, a presumptively novel Nocardia species, and isolates SF10 and SH56 which share 100% and 99.15% sequence similarity to Streptacidiphilus torunensis NF37T and Streptomyces cocklensis BK168T, respectively. The seven strains active against the P. aeruginosa strain (inhibition zones 2.0\u20133.0 mm) were S. pinistramenti SF28T and ones closely related to either the type strains of P. columellifera subspecies pallida (isolates SA4, SF15, and SH24) or S. celluloflavus (isolates SA7, SF8, and SH11). Four of the strains mentioned above, isolates SA7, SF8, SH24, and SH56, inhibited the growth of the S. infantis strain (inhibition zones ranging from 2.0 to 8.0 mm). In turn, several isolates inhibited the growth of C. albicans ATCC 10231, notably isolates SF8, SH11, SH15, SL3, and SL7 which gave inhibition zones ranging from 5.0 to 15.0 mm. The nine isolates which did not show any activity against the reference strains belonged to the genera Actinacidiphila (isolates SA23, SL13, and SL52), Nocardia (isolate SF9), Pilimelia (isolates SF23 and SL16) and Streptomyces (isolates SA8, SA20, and SL54).\nTable\u00a03 shows that some of the isolates from the saline soil inhibited the growth of the B. subtilis, C. albicans, M. luteus, P. aeruginosa and S. infantis strains. In contrast, none of them were active against E. coli PCM 2057, K. pneumoniae ATCC 700603, P. mirabilis CM NCU or S. aureus PCM 2054. It is noteworthy that all of the S. alkaliterrae isolates, apart from OF3, inhibited the growth of P. aeruginosa ATCC 10145 and M. luteus ATCC 10240 following growth on HA agar. Isolate IT2 was the only Nocardiopsis strain to show any activity; it inhibited the growth of the B. subtilis strain and may represent a novel species as it was only loosely associated with its closest phylogenetic neighbour, Nocardipsis flavescens CGMCC 4.5723T (97.45% sequence similarity)."

It is apparent from the Figure\u00a01 that many of the isolates from the Atacama Desert and pine forest samples produced ammonia, IAA and siderophores, but relatively few solubilised phosphate. In contrast, none of the isolates from the saline soil produced IAA or were active in solubilising phosphate whilst few produced ammonia or siderophores, Catenulispora pinistramenti NL8T was the only isolate found to produce hydrogen cyanide (HCN), a volatile compound that has a role in biocontrol by sequestering iron at the expense of phytopathogens (Gu et\u00a0al., 2020).\nSeven isolates from the Atacama Desert soils (25%) showed an ability to release ammonia whilst the corresponding figures for those from the saline soil and from northern and southern inland pine slopes were 1 (6%), 16 (44%) and 21 (60%), respectively. The most active strains were S. pinistramenti SF28T, isolates NA10a and SA16, near phylogenetic neighbours to the type strains of S. celluloflavus and S. sanglieri, respectively, and isolates NL15 and NH28, which were found to be\u00a0members of prospective novel species of Streptacidiphilus and Streptomyces, as they share low sequence similarities with their close phylogenetic relatives, S. carbonis DSM 41954T (98.44% sequence similarity) and S. paludis GSSD-12T (98.13% sequence similarity), respectively.

This group of isolates can be\u00a0extended to include NL16 and NF27, members of prospective novel Actinacidiphila species that are most closely related to A. bryophytorum NEAU-HZ10T (98.48% sequence similarity) and A. yanglinensis 1307T (98.14% sequence similarity), respectively.\nFifty-eight isolates (50%) produced siderophores with activity indices ranging from 0.3 to 17.7. Fifteen of those from the Atacama Desert (54%) showed positive activity indices whereas only three of the isolates from the saline soil (19%) did so; the corresponding numbers for those from the litter and mineral horizons of the northern and southern slopes of the inland pine dunes were 17 (47%) and 23 (66%), respectively. The six Atacama Desert strains with the highest activity indices (range 9.3\u201317.7) were isolates 1G2 and 1R2A1, close relatives to S. flaveolus NBRC 3715T (99.72% sequence similarities), isolate 1SCA21 mentioned above, isolates 5SCA7 and 5HA2, near relatives to Streptomyces marokkonensis Ap1T (99.50% sequence similarity) and S. mutabilis NBRC 12800T (99.79% sequence similarity), respectively, and isolate 2G9, which is close to S. paradoxus NBRC 14887T.

The corresponding numbers from the northern and southern pine dune slopes were low at 25% and 23%, respectively. In general, the highest activity indices were shown by isolates from the desert and saline soils, as exemplified by eight Atacama Desert strains which had activity indices that ranged from 13.4 to 27.3 (Supplementary Table S3A). These isolates included 1R2A1 and 1G2, close relatives to S. flaveolus NBRC 3715T, 3HA10, and 2SCA1 mentioned earlier, and 5HA2, and 5SCA5 and 5SCA7, which are phylogenetically close to S. mutabilis NBRC 12800T and S. marokkonensis Ap1T, respectively whilst 5R2A3 is closely related to M. acroterricola 5R2A7T.\nSeven isolates from the saline soil had activity indices for cellulose degradation ranging from 9.4 to 17.1; three of them, IF11, IF15, and IF19, are close to S. alkaliphius DSM 42118T, two, OF4 and OF6 to N. metallicus KBS6T whereas IT2 and IF7 were shown to be\u00a0members, of prospective novel species of Nocardiopsis and Streptomyces (Table\u00a01).

In contrast, isolates 1HA3, 2R2A4, and 3G5, all of which were assigned to the genus Pseudonocardia, did not degrade cellulose nor did they hydrolyze chitin, pectin or milk protein.\nTwenty-six (23%) of the isolates from the sampling locations degraded chitin albeit with low activity indices (Supplementary Table S3). In marked contrast, all of the isolates from the saline soil hydrolyzed powdered milk, as did most of those from the Atacama Desert soils (57%); the corresponding results for isolates from the northern and southern pine dune slopes were 42% and 69%.

It is interesting that in this study the most extensive actinomycete diversity was found in the litter and mineral horizons of the pine forest.\nConfidence can be\u00a0placed in the 16S rRNA gene sequence data, not least because few significant incongruities were found between wholegenome and 16S rRNA gene trees in an extensive genome-based classification of actinomycetes (Nouioui et\u00a0al., 2018). The phylogenetic data showed that isolates representing each set of colour-groups had distinctive taxonomic profiles thereby underpinning the pioneering work of Williams and his colleagues who found that the distribution of actinomycete populations in different habitats was a product of different environmental variables, such as organic matter content, pH, temperature and water availability (Williams and Mayfield, 1971;\nA\nB\nFIGURE\u00a03 Representative isolates [%] inhibiting fungi and fungi-like organisms tested using a co-culture method.

Indeed, it is now known that in Atacama Desert soils intensive solar irradiation acts synergistically with desiccation in limiting the survival and growth of microbial life (G\u00f3mez-Silva, 2018).\nRepresentative isolates from the high altitude, hyper-arid Atacama Desert soils and saline soil were assigned to the genera Kribbella, Micromonospora, Modestobacter, Pseudonocardia, and Nocardiopsis, respectively, results in good agreement with those from previous surveys (Idris, 2016; Meklat et\u00a0al., 2020; Tsetseg, 2023). Similarly, acidotolerant and acidophilic actinomycetes from the pine forest sites assigned to the genera Actinospica, Catenulispora, Kitasatospora, Nocardia and Streptacidiphilus tallies with those from earlier studies (Goli\u0144ska et\u00a0al., 2023). Members of all of these taxa are known to synthesise bioactive compounds, including novel antibiotics (Takahashi, 2017; Hifnawy et\u00a0al., 2020; Riahi et\u00a0al., 2022; Goli\u0144ska et\u00a0al., 2023; Viru\u00e9s-Segovia et\u00a0al., 2022).\nThe taxonomic status of individual colour-groups can be\u00a0determined from the distribution of the reference strains known to represent specific genera or species (Atalan et\u00a0al., 2000; Sembiring et\u00a0al., 2000; Manfio et\u00a0al., 2003). In this study, multi-membered colour-groups containing isolates from the Atacama Desert soils were found to belong to the genus Streptomyces and the four genera mentioned above. In turn, saline isolates assigned to multi-membered groups corresponded to or were closely related to Nocardiopsis metallicus (Schippers et\u00a0al., 2002) and Streptomyces alkaliterrae (\u015awiecimska et\u00a0al., 2020) whilst ones forming single-membered colour-groups were most closely related to Nocardiopsis halotolerans (Al-Zarban et\u00a0 al., 2002), Nocardiopsis flavescens (Fang et\u00a0al., 2011) and Nocardipsis valiformis (Yang et\u00a0al., 2008). Similarly, multi-membered colour-groups encompassing isolates from the northern slope of the pine forest were equated with the genera Actinacidiphila, Catenulispora, Kitasatospora, Pilimelia, Streptacidiphilus, and Streptomyces. Corresponding multi-membered colour-groups composed of isolates from the southern slope of the pine forest were either equated with the genera Actinacidiphila, Actinospica, Nocardia, and Streptomyces or were close to or bona fide members of Pilimelia columellifera subspecies pallida (Vobis et\u00a0al., 1986) and Streptomyces celluloflavus (Nishimura et\u00a0al., 1953) Madhaiyan et\u00a0al., 2020. These data provide further evidence that 16S rRNA gene sequencing remains a practical way of determining the taxonomic status of filamentous actinomycetes isolated from extreme habitats (Goodfellow et\u00a0al., 2018; Singh and Dubey, 2018; Sharma and Thakur, 2020; Liu et\u00a0al., 2021).\nOver 40% of the isolates assigned to the colour-groups belonged to the genus Streptomyces. The highest number, 69%, were from the saline soil and the lowest, 27%, from the northern slope of the inland pine dune. These results are in line with those from previous studies where streptomycetes were shown to be\u00a0the dominant component of extreme habitats (Bull and Asenjo, 2013; Jiang et\u00a0al., 2018; Sharma and Thakur, 2020). In contrast, streptomycetes have not featured as major components of actinomycete communities in culture-independent studies, as exemplified by analyses of actinomycetes in Atacama Desert soils (Idris et\u00a0al., 2017a; Bull et\u00a0al., 2018) and diverse extreme biomes in Indonesia (Kusuma, 2020). These disparities can be\u00a0attributed to biases in culture-independent methods, such as difficulties in extracting DNA from streptomycetes, choice of PCR primers, RNA copy numbers and PCR amplification (Kutchma et\u00a0 al., 1998; Klappenbach et\u00a0 al., 2000; Engelbrektson et\u00a0al., 2010; Zieli\u0144ska et\u00a0al., 2017), to associated data handling issues (Claesson et\u00a0al., 2010; Escobar-Zepeda et\u00a0al., 2015), and to the use of isolation media that select for streptomycetes (Goodfellow and O\u2019Donnell, 1989).\nSeveral isolates assigned to the genus Streptomyces were found to belong to putatively novel species whereas others showed relatively low\nsequence similarities with the type strains of their closest phylogenetic neighbours or were close to streptomycetes that have rarely been isolated from natural habitats, such as Streptomyces atratus (Shibata et\u00a0al., 1962), Streptomyces cocklensis (Kim et\u00a0 al., 2012), Streptomyces mutabilis (Preobrazhenskaya and Ryabova, 1957), Streptomyces flaveolus (Waksman, 1923; Waksman and Henrici, 1948) and Streptomyces sanglieri (Manfio et\u00a0al., 2003). These results are particularly interesting as similar isolates from extreme habitats have been found to produce novel specialised metabolites (Donald et\u00a0 al., 2022), including Streptomyces leeuwenhoeki strains from hyper-arid Atacama Desert soils (Busarakam et\u00a0al., 2014) which synthesise ansamycin and macrolactone polyketides (Goodfellow et\u00a0al., 2018).\nTwenty-two (19.1%) of representative isolates found to belong to putatively novel species were assigned to genera other than Streptomyces. Nearly half of them were most closely related to the type strains of Streptomyces species that were transferred to the genus Actinacidiphila, namely A. alni, A. bryophytorum, A, paucisporea, A. rubida, and A. yanglinensis (Madhaiyan et\u00a0 al., 2022) whereas others were most closely related to three validly named Streptacidiphulus species, S. albus (Kim et\u00a0al., 2003), S. carbonis (Kim et\u00a0al., 2003) and S. hamsterleyensis (Goli\u0144ska et\u00a0al., 2013). It seems likely that presumptively novel isolates shown to be\u00a0most closely related to the type strains of Streptomyces cocklensis (Kim et\u00a0 al., 2012) and Streptomyces ferralitis (SaintpierreBonaccio et\u00a0al., 2004) will be\u00a0found to belong to the genus Actinacidiphila given the close phylogenetic relationships of these taxa with Streptomyces species recently transferred to this genus (Labeda et\u00a0al., 2012, 2017). It is also interesting that isolate SA10 is most closely related to the type strain of Actinospica acidiphila (Cavaletti et\u00a0al., 2006), an actinomycete found to merit generic status (Goli\u0144ska et\u00a0 al., 2023). Similarly, presumptively novel isolates from the other sampling sites were found be\u00a0most closely related to Kribbella turkmenica (Saygin et\u00a0al., 2019), Nocardiopsis flavescens (Fang et\u00a0 al., 2011), Nocardiopsis halotolerans (Al-Zarban et\u00a0al., 2002), and Pseudonocardia xinjiangensis (Xu et\u00a0al., 1999; Huang et\u00a0al., 2002). It is likely that some of the isolates found to share sequence similarities above the 99.0% threshold with the type strains of their immediate phylogenetic neighbours will be\u00a0members of putatively novel species. Indeed, it has been shown that actinomycetes sharing very high and almost identical 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities can be\u00a0classified into different species based on extensive polyphasic taxonomic studies, as shown in the case of closely related members of the genera Gordonia, Micromonospora and Streptomyces strains (Riesco et\u00a0al., 2018, 2022; Kusuma et\u00a0al., 2021).\nThe taxonomic data acquired in this study show that selective isolation, dereplication and initial characterization of representative isolates from diverse extreme biomes is a simple and practical way of selecting putatively novel and rare filamentous actinomycetes for exploitative biotechnology. In addition, these data underpin the rational of ecologically guided bioprospecting campaigns featuring actinomycetes (Mitra et\u00a0al., 2011; Nalini and Prakash, 2017; Liu et\u00a0al., 2021; Wang et\u00a0al., 2022). Many of the isolates found to belong to rare and putatively novel taxa were from the litter and mineral horizons of the pine forest indicating that acidophilic and acidotolerant filamentous actinomycetes should feature more prominently in the search for novel bioactive compounds, especially given evidence that such strains are a source of novel antibiotics and acid-stable enzymes (Goli\u0144ska et\u00a0al., 2023). Further studies are also needed to determine whether litter and mineral horizons in coniferous woodlands contain characteristic actinomycete communities, as implied by Goodfellow and Dawson (1978).\n\u015awiecimska et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.1054384\nFrontiers in Microbiology 19 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "There is a urgent need to find a new generation of antibiotics that are effective against multidrug-resistant microbial pathoges (Tacconelli et\u00a0al., 2018), especially Gram-negative ones that cause high mortality rates in hospital acquired infections (Mehrad et\u00a0 al., 2015). It is encouraging that nearly 70% of the dereplicated isolates included in the antimicrobial screens showed activity against at least one of a panel of reference strains, as was the case in corresponding studies on isolates from extreme hyper-arid Atacama Desert soils where hit rates of 68% were recorded (Busarakam et\u00a0al., 2014; Idris, 2016). These figures are much higher than those recorded in comparable studies on non-dereplicated isolates (Sengupta et\u00a0al., 2015; Prieto-Dav\u00f3 et\u00a0al., 2016; Priyadarshini et\u00a0 al., 2016). Further, the importance of growing dereplicated isolates on more than one production medium (Goodfellow and Fiedler, 2010) was underlined by instances where positive results were only reported for isolates grown on only one of the cultivation media.\nThe isolates from the pine forest sites, notably those from the southern inland pine dune, were especially effective in inhibiting the growth of the E. coli (34%), K. pneumoniae (28%), P. aeruginosa (10%), P. mirabilis (15%), and S. infantis (30%) strains following growth on one or both of the cultivation media. The most active isolates were S. pinistramenti SF28T and those closely related to P. columellifera subspecies pallida and S. celluloflavus, as they inhibited the growth of all but one of the reference strains. In contrast, few, if any, of the isolates from the Atacama Desert and saline sites inhibited the growth of the E. coli, K. pneumoniae, and P. mirabilis strains. In contrast, the five S. alkaliterrae isolates from the saline soil inhibited the growth of the P. aeruginosa strain following growth on HA agar; isolate 1G2, a near relative of S. flaveolus, from the Atacama Desert soil also inhibited the growth of this reference strain when cultivated on ISP3 agar.\nThe ability of the isolates to inhibit the growth of the Gram-positive reference strains was evenly distributed across all of the sampling sites though none of the isolates from the saline soil were active against S. aureus PCM 2054 and only a putatively novel Nocardiopsis strain inhibited the growth of B. subtilis PCM 2021. Thirty-five of the isolates (30%) showed activity against the latter, the corresponding figures for the M. luteus and S. aureus reference strains were 53 (46%) and 38 (33%), respectively, following growth on at least one of the production media. Comparable results were recorded against the B. subtilis and S. aureus reference strains for dereplicated filamentous actinomycetes from high altitude Atacama Desert soils (Idris, 2016).\nMost of the 25 isolates (22%) active against all of the Gram-positive reference strains were from the pine forest sites. These isolates included S. pinistramenti SF28T and ones found to be\u00a0 closely related to S. celluloflavus, P. columellifera subspecies pallida, and S. xanthochromogenes; four of the remaining strains were assigned to putatively novel Actinacidiphila species and another two were members of prospective novel Streptomyces species. Similarly, two of the four corresponding isolates from the Atacama Desert soils were found to be\u00a0putatively novel Streptomyces species; the remaining ones, isolates 3HA10 and 1SCA19, were most closely related to Streptomyces galbus (Frommer, 1959) and Streptomyces purpurascens (Lindenbein, 1952), respectively.\nMost of the 33 isolates (29%) shown to be\u00a0active against C. albicans ATCC 10231 were from the pine forest soils though the five S. alkaliterrae isolates from the saline soil also gave positive results. The 15 isolates from the pine forest which gave positive results following\ngrowth on ISP2 and ISP3 agar included five that were close to S. celluloflavus, two to S. xanthochromogenes, one to P. columellifera subspecies pallida (isolate NL28), and six belonging to presumptively novel Actinacidiphila, Streptacidiphilus and Streptomyces species. The final strain, isolate NH22, is phylogenetically close to the type strain of Streptacidiphilus neutrinimicus.\nLittle, if anything, is known about the antimicrobial activities of the taxa cited above though a strain from an acid mangrove soil identified as S. celluloflavus produced diverse specialised metabolites (Nguyan and Cao, 2022). Similarly, a soil isolate identified as S. purpurascens synthesised several bioactive compounds, notably rhodomycin C, which is particularly active against B. subtilis (Holkar et\u00a0al., 2013). Further, a strain identified as S. xanthochromogenes showed antifungal activity (Singh et\u00a0al., 2016), as did a P. columellifera subspecies pallida isolate which was active against fungi-causing superficial mycoses (Wypij et\u00a0al., 2017)."

Actinomycetes from extreme habitats are increasingly being seen as relevant in this respect given their role in nutrient recycling and promoting plant growth, as witnessed by their capacity to solubilise phosphate, synthesise phytohormones, notably IAA, lytic enzymes and siderophores (Boukhatem et\u00a0al., 2022; Pathom-aree et\u00a0al., 2023). The use of Streptomyces venezuelae as a biofertilizer, for example, increased maize production under drought conditions due to its ability to secrete high levels of IAA and L-aminocyclopropane (ACC; Chukwuneme et\u00a0al., 2020); ACC is an immediate precursor of the gaseous hormone, ethylene. Plant growth promoting bacteria (PGPB) play an important role lowering plant stress by reducing ethylene levels by hydrolyzing ACC to ammonia, \u03b1-ketobutyrate and methionine thereby regulating ethylene production (Mulani et\u00a0 al., 2021); plants inoculated with ACC-deaminase producing bacteria are more resistant to abiotic and biotic stress (Gupta and Pandey, 2019). In the present study, representative isolates from the Atacama Desert and pine forest sampling sites produced ammonia and IAA, solubilised phosphate and synthesised siderophores. In contrast, none of those from the saline soil produced IAA or solubilised phosphate and only one, isolate OT1, a close relative to Nocardiopsis valliformis, formed ammonia. However, actinomycetes are known to promote the growth of plants adapted to saline conditions, as exemplified by an endophytic Micromonospora chalcea strain which enhanced the growth of Salicornia bigelovii (El-Tarabily et\u00a0al., 2019).\nIn general, actinomycetes isolated from the pine forest were the most proficient in synthesising PGP-metabolites, as shown by five isolates that were most active in producing ammonia, namely S. pinistramenti SF28T, strains close to the type strains of S celluloflavus and S. sanglieri and ones considered to be\u00a0members of presumptive novel species of Streptacidiphilus and Streptomyces. Isolates 1HA1 and 5R2A3, near relatives of Kribbella italica (Everest et\u00a0 al., 2015) and Micromonospora acroterricola (Carro et\u00a0al., 2019), respectively, were particularly gifted in their ability to produce IAA, as was isolate SA8, another close relative of S. sanglieri.\nThirteen isolates were shown to be\u00a0 especially active in synthesising siderophores (activity indices 8.6\u201317.7). They included\n\u015awiecimska et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.1054384\nFrontiers in Microbiology 20 frontiersin.org\nsix from the Atacama Desert, namely ones phylogenetically close to Streptomyces flaveolus, Streptomyces marokkonensis (Bouizgarne et\u00a0 al., 2009), Streptomyces mutabilis (Preobrazhenskaya and Ryabova, 1957) and Streptomyces tendae (Ettlinger et\u00a0al., 1958), the remaining strain, isolate 2G9, belongs to a putatively novel Streptomyces species most closely related to Streptomyces paradoxus (Krasil'nikov and Yuan, 1961; Goodfellow et\u00a0 al., 1986). The corresponding organisms from the pine forest sites were C. pinisilvae NF3, S. pinistramenti SF28T, isolates close to S. celluloflavus and S. halstedii, and isolate NH17, a presumptively novel Streptomyces species. The remaining isolates close to S. celluloflavus also produced siderophores, notably NA10a, SH15, SF8, and SL3, which showed activity indices ranging from 4.7 to 6.6. These results provide additional evidence that taxonomically diverse filamentous actinomycetes are a valuable source of ironbinding compounds (Franco-Correa and Chavarro-Anzola, 2016), many of which promote plant growth (Boukhatem et\u00a0al., 2022)."

Novel hydrolytic enzymes are also a valuable resource for industrial processes (Mukhtar et\u00a0al., 2017; Jin et\u00a0al., 2019). Isolates from all of the sampling sites produced cellulases, chitinases, lipases and proteinases though pectinase activity was restricted mainly to ones from the Atacama Desert soils, notably isolates 1R2A7, 3HA10, and 1SCA21, which were found to be\u00a0close relatives to the type strains Streptomyces aquilus, S. galbus and S. tandae, respectively, and 2G9 and 4SCA5, members of two prospective novel Streptomyces species. Several isolates showed a marked ability to produce cellulases (activity indices \u226515.0), mainly ones related to M. acroterricola, N. metallicus, S. cocklensis, S. flaveolus, S. galbus, S. marokkonensis and isolate IF7, which was assigned to a putatively novel Streptomyces species. Atacama Desert isolates also showed an ability to produce lipases (activity indices >10), as shown by strains closely related to K. flavida, M. acroterricola, Pseudonocardia khuvsgulensis (Ara et\u00a0 al., 2011), Pseudonocardia rhizophila (Li et\u00a0 al., 2010) and S. mutabilis; two additional strains, isolates 2SCA1 and 3G5, were shown to be\u00a0putatively novel Kribbella and Pseudonocardia species, respectively.\nThe seventy-one isolates (62%) which secreted proteases included all of those from the saline soil. Isolates showing high or very high activity indices (>10) were recovered from all of the sampling sites. Most of the isolates were streptomycetes that either belonged or were closely related to S. alkaliphilus, S. alkaliterrae, S. atratus, S. cellulofalvus, S. sanglieri, S. yanii, and S. xanthochromogenes or, as in the case of isolate 2G9, belonged to a putatively novel Streptomyces species. The most highly active non-streptomycetes isolates were either closely related to the type strains of K. herbaricolor and K. flavida or represented a prospective novel Kribbella species. These results are in sync with those reported for many strains isolated from extreme habitats, as exemplified by a strain found to be\u00a0closely related to the type strain of Kribbella gitaiheensis (Tsetseg and Badamgavar, 2021), a soil isolate (Guo L. et\u00a0al., 2015).\nIt is not surprising that isolates from each of the sampling sites hydrolyzed urea, as this is common feature of streptomycetes. However, all of the most highly active strains were from the pine forest soils, including S. pinistramenti SF28T, and ones closely related to S. atratus\nand S. yanii. In addition, seven out of the nine isolates closely related to the type strain of S. celluloflavus gave strong reactions. Similarly, all but one of the isolates closely related to P. columellifera subspecies pallida gave highly positive results, the exception, isolate SF15, was negative. Most of the putatively novel Actinacidiphila, Streptacidiphilus, and Streptomyces isolates gave markedly positive results."

Actinomycetes are to the fore amongst microbial control agents given their ability to produce antifungal compounds and siderophores, secrete enzymes that degrade fungal cell walls and compete for nutrients (Guo X. et\u00a0 al., 2015; Alblooshi et\u00a0 al., 2021). Taxonomically diverse actinomycetes, notably streptomycetes, inhibit the growth of phytopathogens, as exemplified by Abdelrahman et\u00a0al. (2022) who found that streptomycetes from rhizosphere and soil samples in the Sudan inhibited the growth of the devastating oomycete pathogen Phytophthora infestans. Further, an actinomycete closely related to Streptomyces spectabilis inhibited the growth of 11 plant pathogens (Chen et\u00a0al., 2018) whereas Nocardiopsis and Streptomyces were found to show in vitro and in planta activity against bacterial and fungal pathogens of carrots and tomatoes (Djebaili et\u00a0al., 2021). In this context, it is remarkable that so many of the isolates from the litter and mineral horizons of the pine forest inhibited the growth of the fungal pathogens. Little is known about the functional roles of actinomycetes in acidic forest soils though it seems likely that they will compete with fungal populations for nutrients (Matthies et\u00a0 al., 1997; Rousk et\u00a0al., 2009).\nTaxonomically diverse isolates, albeit mainly streptomycetes, showed pronounced broad spectrum activity (>70% inhibition) against many of the fungal and oomycete pathogens, notably isolates showing high or identical sequence similarities with the type strains of S. celluloflavus and S. xanthochromogenes. The most active isolate in this respect was S. pinistramenti SF28T which inhibited the growth of 17 of the 19 plant pathogens, a result that built upon the earlier work of \u015awiecimska et\u00a0al. (2022). These results provide further evidence, that streptomycetes from poorly studied extreme habitats have the ability to control the growth of plant pathogens (Suksaard et\u00a0al., 2017; Pathom-aree et\u00a0al., 2019; Qi et\u00a0al., 2019).\nNon-streptomycete isolates which showed either pronounced or notable broad spectrum activity against some of the fungal pathogens included ones closely related to Catenulispora pinisilvae, Kitasatospora herbaricolor, Streptacidiphilus neutrinimicus and Streptacidiphilus torunensis, and putatively novel isolates that were most closely related to the type strains of Nocardia nova and Streptacidiphilus hamsterleyensis. These results provide further evidence that isolates assigned to several actinomycete genera have the ability to inhibit the growth of fungal pathogens (Mart\u00ednez-Hidalgo et\u00a0 al., 2015; Ebrahimi-Zarandi et\u00a0 al., 2022). Few of the isolates showed pronounced activity against the oomycetes, a notable exception was S. pinistramenti SF28T, which inhibited the growth of P. cactorum and P. plurivora; several isolates which shared high or identical sequence similarities with the type strains of P. columellifera subspecies pallida and S. celluloflavus also inhibited the latter.\n\u015awiecimska et al. 10.3389/fmicb.2022.1054384\nFrontiers in Microbiology 21 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "Initial steps in natural product pipelines designed to discover new bioactive compounds from actinomycetes are often taken for granted given an understandable focus on outcomes, that is, the commercial exploitation of novel chemical compounds. Nevertheless, the selective isolation, characterization and screening of actinomycetes from unexplored or poorly studied extreme biomes highlights actinomycetes that can be\u00a0prioritised in the search for new bioactive compounds using state-of-the-art technologies, such as genome mining, genetic engineering and procedures that allow rapid dereplication of chemical entities from complex biological extracts.\nIn the present study the importance of the early steps in the natural product pipeline was underpinned by the isolation of taxonomically diverse actinomycetes from three extreme ecosystems which produced a broad range of bioactive compounds. It was particularly significant that dereplicated isolates from the litter and mineral horizons of the pine forest included members of rare and novel genera which not only showed an extraordinary ability to inhibit the growth of diverse fungal and oomycete phytopathogens, but also inhibited the growth of members of Gram-negative taxa that are on the list of multidrug-resistant taxa highlighted by the World Health Organization. In addition, representatives of several genera, notably Actinacidiphila, Pilimelia and Streptomyces, not only inhibited the growth of a panel of microorganisms in the antimicrobial assays, but also produced compounds that promote plant growth. Another notable outcome of this study was the isolation of so many putatively novel species, especially ones belonging to the genera Streptomyces and the association of other isolates with rare validly named species belonging to poorly studied genera, such as Actinacidiphila, Kribbella, Pilimelia and Streptacidiphilus. Further work is now in the progress to build upon these developments.\nConsequently, all-embracing culture-dependent studies such as the present one should be\u00a0 seen as an integral part of platforms designed to foster research collaboration on actinomycetes designed to address some of the critical challenges facing humankind, not least the need to find new antibiotics for multiple purposes and effective biofertilizers and bioinoculants for sustainable agricultural practices. It is also worth noting that enforceable measures are needed to safeguard actinomycete communities in fragile biomes given problems associated with habitat destruction and the effects of climate breakdown."
