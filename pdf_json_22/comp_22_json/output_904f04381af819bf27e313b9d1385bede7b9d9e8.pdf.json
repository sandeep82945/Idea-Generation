Achievable information rates are derived and assessed that include the availability of diversity, shaping, bitmetric decoding, repetition coding and automatic repeat request with maximum-ratio combining. A channel coding scheme is presented that approaches the theoretic limits within 1 dB. Extrinsic information transfer analysis for the free-space optical fading channel shows that a code design tailored to the additive white Gaussian noise channel is robust for fading channels with various parameters.",

            "text": "I. INTRODUCTION\nFree-space optical (FSO) satellite links complement radio frequency (RF) links and may serve the increasing demand for bandwidth. While current RF systems can sustain data rates of at most some Gbps, FSO links target data rates of tens to hundreds of Gbps [1]. Such high data rates are particularly interesting for low earth orbit (LEO) satellite downlinks: the LEO satellite is only visible for a few minutes (between 5 and 15) in which the data transfer from the satellite to ground takes place. A key enabler for high data rates are higher order (coherent) modulation techniques paired with powerful forward error correction (FEC) schemes which are widely used in fiber optical systems [2] but are non-standard for FSO links.\nDue to the high frequency of the optical signal, the FSO communication channel is prone to undesired impairments [3].1 One effect is scintillation (the analog of fading in RF systems) which refers to fluctuations of the signal amplitude due to the changing characteristics of the transmission medium (air). It is well-established that with channel state information (CSI) at the receiver (RX) the ergodic capacity of fading channels is at most the capacity of an additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) with the same signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) [4]. For non-ergodic fading channels the Shannon capacity is often zero. In this case, additional countermeasures in terms of diversity techniques are employed.\nThis work considers coherent transmission over FSO LEO downlinks. We derive achievable information rates to provide insight into the system design and to provide a suitable channel code design. Different assumptions on the communication system are investigated, for instance the impact of diversity, the type of information the decoder is able to process, a shaping\n1In fact, also modern RF satellite systems exploit higher frequency bands for transmission, such as the Q/V bands and hence are subject to undesired channel impairments.\ncode, maximum-ratio combining (MRC) and automatic repeat request (ARQ) techniques. Finally, low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are shown to approach the computed rates closely. A protograph extrinsic information transfer (EXIT) analysis [5] for the FSO fading channel suggests that code ensemble designed for the AWGN channel are a robust choice for FSO downlinks."

Let the modulation order be M , the transmission rate R = Rcb, where b = log2M is the number of bits per modulation symbol. We will consider structured, protograph LDPC codes [6]. A protograph is a small bipartite graph that can be described by an mb \u00d7 nb adjacency matrix or base matrix B = [bi,j ]. The bipartite graph of an LDPC code is obtained by copying the protograph Q times and interconnecting the edges of the copies. This is called lifting or expansion and is detailed in [6].

This is since very low channel gains occur with non-zero probability (the so-called outage probability)\nand error-free decoding is only possible when the rate tends to zero. We consider the block fading channel with L blocks per codeword and define the outage probability as\npout(R) = Pr { max P (x) 1 L L\u2211 `=1 I(X,Y,H`) < R } (4)\nwhere the r.v. I(X,Y,H`) denotes the rate supported by the channel in block ` and it takes values I(X;Y |H` = h). Example 1. In case of the unconstrained input AWGN channel (with block fading) we obtain\nI(X,Y,H`) = 1\n2 log2\n( 1 +H`\nEs N0\n) .\nThe distribution of I(X,Y,H`) is obtained from the distribution of H` by transformation of r.v.s.\nThe \u2212outage capacity is the maximum transmission rate such that the outage probability is smaller than a fixed value , i.e.,\nC = argmax R pout(R) < . (5)\n(5) can be computed numerically by the Monte Carlo method and implies that we can communicate error-free (at least) a fraction of time which is 1 \u2212 . Then, in average we can communicate error free with a rate\nR\u0304 = (1\u2212 )C .\nAverage rates R\u0304 versus EsN0 for uniform and shaped 4-ASK are depicted in Fig. 1 for the AWGN channel, the fast fading channel, and the block fading channel with = 10\u22122. 4-ASK (or 16-QAM) modulation is of high interest for upcoming FSO satellite systems and thus will be considered as a baseline for the results. Literature [13] provides representative values of the power scintillation index S which can be converted to s2h as\ns2h = ln(1 + S).\nFor the plots we selected s2h = 0.1 which is typical for weak turbulence, an elevation of 10\u25e6, a wavelength of 847 nm, and an aperture size of 40 cm. A broader set of values for s2h and is considered in Tables I and II, respectively. Observe from Fig. 1 that the maximum shaping gain for the LN fading channel is around 0.39 dB while it is around 0.44 dB on the AWGN channel (not shown).2 Table I shows that the shaping gain decreases with increasing s2h. Likewise, for s 2 h = 0.1 and\n= 10\u22122 the figure shows a gap of 0.188 dB between the ergodic LN fading channel and the AWGN channel capacity, at rate R = 1. In case of the block fading channel with one block (L = 1) we observe a gap of 3.3 dB with respect to the ergodic channel. Diversity considerably helps to reduce the gap, e.g., to 1.23 dB for L = 8. In case of stricter requirements on the gap to the ergodic rate increases up to 2.11 dB for = 10\u22125 and L = 8, as shown in Table II. In fact, we observe\n2For 8-ASK (64-QAM) the shaping gain is around 0.8 dB for an AWGN channel. Due to practical reasons we restrict to lower modulation orders.\nthat the gap to the ergodic LN fading channel increases with decreasing and decreases with the number of blocks per codeword L.\nRemark 1. The simplified block fading channel model gives insights on the dimensioning of the channel interleaver. For instance, the length of a block can be considered as a proxy of the channel\u2019s coherence time. Then, Fig. 1 gives a prediction on the achievable rates for an interleaver spanning over L times the coherence time. The accuracy of this assumption is illustrated in Fig. 5."

Observe that repetition of the codewords (and MRC at the RX) shows big losses with respect to the competitors. In fact, it may yield worse performance than a scheme with comparable overall rate, but no diversity at all (L = 1).

Likewise, we consider hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ) with MRC, also referred to as Chase combining. The instantaneous SNR at the combiner output at the ith transmission round is given by (7) and i can be computed as a function of R from (4).\nFig. 3 shows average rates R\u0304 for ARQ and HARQ with MRC for T = \u221e assuming that the transmission rate is optimized for each EsN0 . It turns out that E[X] is close to one particularly for moderate/high EsN0 (not shown), i.e., retransmissions occur rarely. Overall, the average rate curve for (H)ARQ is close to the one for the block fading channel with L = 2 which implies a notable loss compared to the fast fading channel. Also, one may assume a fixed transmission rate due\nto practical limitations. In this case, we observe a loss compared to the optimized (H)ARQ curves, except for a specific operating point. For instance, in case of R = 2 \u00b7 223/255 the operating point is around EsN0 = 14.5 dB and R\u0304 = 1.7. At an average rate of R\u0304 = 0.5 the difference in terms of EsN0 for ARQ compared to the LN fast fading channel is around 11 dB, whereas for HARQ with MRC it is around 7 dB. In Fig. 3 the three \u2019x\u2019-markers subdivide the (H)ARQ curves into four different segments. Points (rates) on the rightmost segment are achievable for T \u2265 2, on the middle-right for T \u2265 4, on the middle-left for T \u2265 16, and on the leftmost segment for T =\u221e."

Currently, LDPC codes are subject to Consultative Committee for Space Data Systems (CCSDS) standardization for FSO downlinks with on-off keying (OOK) [18]. Next, we present a methodology for the LDPC code design for coherent communications, paired with a code design example. In particular, the code design is performed on a surrogate binary-input AWGN channel with adaptations to support higher order modulations and fading. This is since LDPC codes are known to be universal, i.e., code designs for one channel usually perform well also on other channels."

More specifically, we evaluate the conditional entropy H (Bi|Y ) of each bit channel and match it with the conditional entropy H (X|Y ) of a surrogate biAWGN channel. This way, standard protograph EXIT analysis can be applied to obtain an estimate of the code ensemble\u2019s iterative decoding threshold [20]. The mapping of the nb \u2212 1 (not punctured) VN types in the protograph to the b bit channels impacts the threshold. We perform an optimization of this mapping. It turns out that a random assignment of the bit channels to the n code bits yields only minor losses (Fig. 4).\n2) EXIT analysis for fast fading channels: Each of the Q VNs of the code associated to a specific VN type receive channel messages from fading channels with i.i.d. power gains. Thus for a (not punctured) VN type in the protograph we compute an average MI at its output, where averaging is done over the different parameters of the channel message. Formally, let IEv|` be the MI between the `th VN output message and the associated codeword bit, Ich the MI between the channel observation and the associated codeword bit, and IAv|` be the MI between the `th VN input message and the associated codeword bit [5]. We modify the computation of the extrinsic information at the VNs as\nIEv|` = E [ f(IAv|1, ..., IAv|`\u22121, IAv|`+1, ..., IAv|dv , Ich) ] where f(\u00b7) is the VN EXIT function, dv is the VN degree, and the expectation is done over the r.v. Ich.\n3) EXIT analysis for block fading channels: Consider a block fading channel with L blocks. By EXIT analysis we can determine the L-dimensional convergence region (outage limit) of a protograph LDPC code ensemble which are all admissible values of \u0393` = H` EsN0 , ` \u2208 {1, . . . , L} such that EXIT analysis converges [21]. We are interested in a related quantity, namely the outage probability of the ensemble which is obtained through Monte Carlo simulations: for a specific Es N0\nwe draw L i.i.d. samples of the power gain and compute the conditional entropy of the b \u00b7 L bit channels and proceed\nas in IV-B1. EXIT analysis will either declare convergence or decoding failure. We repeat the experiment mc times and count the number of decoding failures e. Then, e/mc gives an estimate on the outage probability pout of a specific protograph LDPC code ensemble. The mapping between VN types and blocks of the block fading channel is optimized, but a random permutation of the code bits turns out to be a good choice."

In addition, we plot the theoretic limit/outage probability for a capacity achieving code using (3) and (5), as well as the LDPC code ensemble\u2019s iterative decoding threshold/outage probability. Observe that we experience a loss between the theoretical limits and the asymptotic performance of the ensemble due to the suboptimality of the code design and an additional loss due to finite length effects. However, the proposed LDPC code performs within 1 dB from the theoretic limits over the different LN fading channels which confirms the validity of the code design.\n2) Frame error rate for correlated fading channel: We consider a correlated LN fading channel (see Section II-C) and empirically define the coherence period as the number of symbols after which the auto-correlation function drops\nby 8 dB. Let the channel interleaver span over L coherence periods. The FER of the proposed ARA LDPC code versus Es N0\nis depicted in Fig. 5. For comparison, the FER over a block fading channel with L blocks is also shown. Observe that the block fading channel is too pessimistic for L = 1 due to the constant channel gain over an entire block (codeword). By contrast, for L \u2265 4 the block fading channel turns out to be a reasonably good proxy of the correlated fading channel. Remark 2. While rates for the block fading channel can be easily obtained (see Section III), the analysis of a general correlated channel is more cumbersome."

            "text": "This work derives information rates for the coherent FSO LEO downlinks. We find that the shaping gain for 4-ASK (16-QAM) is limited to around 0.3 dB so that additional implementation complexity of a shaping code might not justify its use for such low modulation orders. We find that BMD on the fading channel performs similarly to coded modulation, i.e, there is virtually no penalty in using binary codes. Repetition coding with MRC for increased diversity turns out to be an unfavorable choice, even compared to a coded scheme without any diversity (at least for transmission rates above 0.4 bits per channel use). Similar conclusions hold for ARQ and HARQ with MRC. Furthermore, we propose practical LDPC codes whose encoders can be implemented on-board of a satellite and which perform within 1 dB from theoretical limits. Based on techniques from the literature, we modify EXIT analysis\nand determine iterative decoding thresholds, as well as outage probabilities for protograph LDPC code ensembles over the FSO fading channel. Asymptotic results show that an AWGN code design is robust for various fading channel parameters, where the loss to theoretic limits is between 0.3 dB and 0.6 dB."
