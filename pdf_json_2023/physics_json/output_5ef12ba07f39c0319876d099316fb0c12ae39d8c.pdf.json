However, it is challenging to achieve precise, broad-spectrum and tractable 21 senolysis. Here, we integrate multiple technologies that combine the enzyme substrate of 22 senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-gal) with fluorescence-tag for the precise tracking of SnCs; 23 construction of a bioorthogonal receptor triggered by SA-\u03b2-gal to target and anchor SnCs with single-cell 24 resolution; and incorporation of a selenium atom to generate singlet oxygen and achieve precise 25 senolysis through controllable photodynamic therapy (PDT). We generate KSL0608-Se, a photosensitive 26 senolytic prodrug, which is selectively activated by SA-\u03b2-gal. In naturally-aged mice, 27 KSL0608-Se-mediated PDT prevented upregulation of age-related SnCs markers and 28 senescence-associated secretory phenotype factors. This treatment also countered age-induced losses in 29 liver and renal function as well as inhibited the age-associated physical dysfunction in mice. We therefore 30 provide a strategy to monitor and selectively eliminate SnCs to regulate aging. 31\n32 Aging is the leading risk factor associated with numerous pathologies, including cancer and fibrosis1-3. A 33 fundamental aging mechanism has been proposed to be linked to the excessive, usually time-dependent, 34 development of cellular senescence, a stable and stagnant terminal state that occurs after stress-induced cellular 35 damage1,4. This accumulation drives inflammation-mediated tissue dysfunction and aging by promoting the 36 secretion of proinflammatory and matrix-degrading molecules (known as the senescence-associated secretory 37 phenotype, SASP)5,6. The selective removal of senescent cells (SnCs), termed \u201csenolysis\u201d, can alleviate these 38 age-related features and extend the healthy lifespan, as supported by recent investigations in mice7, leading to an 39 exploration of therapeutic approaches towards senolysis8-13. 40 Surgical removal of aging tissue is currently used as a therapeutic approach for the motor dysfunction caused 41 by the accumulation of SnCs. However, because this treatment is limited to muscle aging and causes trauma and 42 pain to patients, a better approach would be to selectively eliminate SnCs with senolytic drugs (senolytics). 43 Senolytics were initially selected based on their ability to transiently switch off senescence-associated 44 antiapoptotic pathways14-18. Typical examples include ABT-737 and ABT-263, which target SnCs to induce 45 apoptosis by inhibiting antiapoptotic proteins in the BCL-2 family8,19-22. Some natural senolytics, such as 46 quercetin and fisetin, have also proved effective in influencing aging and age-related diseases16,23-25. However, 47 SnCs exhibit great heterogeneity and dynamics in vivo9,10,26-28, resulting in significant limitations of these 48 senolytics in terms of accuracy (no toxicity to non-SnCs), tractability (administration controllability) and 49 broad-spectrum activity (effectiveness against different types of SnCs). Even though there are emerging strategies 50 to address these issues, including glutaminolysis inhibition26 and enzyme-targeted prodrugs9,10, to the best of our 51 knowledge, no report has described a smart, senotherapeutic agent able to achieve all these aims. 52 The integration of multiple technologies is an appealing way to achieve the development of such desirable 53 senolytics. Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a contemporary therapeutic technique that can destroy target cells by 54\n2\nactivating a photosensitive drug with the aid of a light source29-32, which offers the potential to improve the 55 tractability of senolytics due to the dependence on light illumination. Meanwhile, the prodrug strategy targeting 56 senescence-associated \u03b2-galactosidase (SA-\u03b2-gal) for senolysis has shown advantages in broad-spectrum activity 57 since the enhanced activity of this enzyme is a common feature of SnCs9,33,34. A further challenge in the targeting 58 of small-molecule drugs in general is that they readily exit their target cells due to rapid transport across cell 59 membranes and enter the surrounding normal cells due to free diffusion. The utilization of emerging anchoring 60 technologies that can covalently bind drugs to sites of interest through bioorthogonal reactions35-40 could limit 61 such off-target effects. 62 Accordingly, we here report the construction of a smart senotherapeutic agent, KSL0608-Se, that integrates 63 PDT with \u03b2-gal-targeted prodrug and target-site anchoring technologies to achieve tractable, broad-spectrum 64 activity and accuracy. This integrated strategy enables the selective activation of KSL0608-Se by SA-\u03b2-gal to 65 form a bioorthogonal receptor (quinone methide). The active receptor covalently reacts with exposed nucleophilic 66 groups (e.g., sulfhydryls) on the surfaces of surrounding proteins, converting the prodrug into a near-infrared 67 (NIR)-emitting senolytic drug. The bioorthogonal reaction and fluorescence off-on behaviour occur only after 68 activation by SA-\u03b2-gal, which allows selective monitoring of and precise anchoring to SnCs. The newly formed 69 drug can be activated by light in situ to produce singlet oxygen in SnCs, resulting in photocontrollable senolysis 70 at single-cell resolution. KSL0608-Se achieved the specific recognition and selective clearance of SnCs in a 71 complex coculture system of young cells and SnCs. Of note, in naturally aged mice and mice treated with 72 doxorubicin (doxo), the KSL0608-Se-guided therapy effectively decreased the number of SA-\u03b2-gal-positive cells 73 and inhibited the expression of age-related genes and markers. This treatment also showed the ability to improve 74 age-associated physical dysfunctions in naturally aged mice. In brief, our unprecedented integration strategy can 75 effectively eliminate SnCs and exhibit the potential to counteract aging and ameliorate age-related diseases. 76\n77 Results 78 Design of a photoactivatable prodrug for senolysis. Our main focus in designing this senolytic prodrug was 79 ensuring the accurate delivery of the photosensitive drug to SnCs for precise and controllable yet complete 80 senolysis with single-cell resolution. We then report a prodrug strategy to design a photosensitive senolytic agent 81 activated by SA-\u03b2-gal, an enzyme both specific to and widespread among SnCs. The synthesis starts with the 82 modification of a dicyanomethylene-4H-pyran (DCM) based skeleton with favorable donor\u2212\u03c0\u2212acceptor (D\u2212\u03c0\u2212A) 83 characteristics and a phenolic group for regulating electron-donating capability (Fig. 1a). We then replaced the 84 oxygen (O) atom on the skeleton with a selenium (Se) atom to enhance singlet oxygen generation upon 85 photoirradiation. It is believed that this effect is attributed to the increase in molecular dipoles and the enhanced 86 intersystem crossing ability (ISC)30,41,42. To this photosensitive scaffold, a \u03b2-D-galactosyl group was attached as 87 both the SA-\u03b2-gal-responsive site and the phototoxicity blocking group, and a fluoromethyl was added as a 88 self-immobilizing moiety, creating the photosensitive prodrug KSL0608-Se. This prodrug is converted to a 89 bioorthogonal quinone-methide receptor via a 2-fluoromethylphenol intermediate immediately after its specific 90 hydrolysis by SA-\u03b2-gal. This receptor is unique in that it can covalently attach to nearby proteins and selectively 91 generate a photosensitive drug in situ in SnCs (Fig. 1b). Based on the same design strategy, a self-immobilizing 92 SA-\u03b2-gal fluorescent probe with O instead of Se, KSL0608-O, was synthesized (Fig. 1a). After hydrolysis by 93 SA-\u03b2-gal, KSL0608-O exhibits fluorescence similar to KSL0608-Se but does not produce a phototoxic substance, 94 thus it is also a desirable control. Accordingly, KSL0608-O and KSL0608-Se were synthesized as outlined in Fig. 95 1a, described in more detail in the Supplementary Information (Section \u201cSynthesis and characterization\u201d and 96 Supplementary Figs. 12-55). 97 98 Spectral response towards \u03b2-galactosidase (\u03b2-gal). The fluorescence spectra and the absorption spectra of 99 KSL0608-O and KSL0608-Se were evaluated. E. coli \u03b2-gal, as the SA-\u03b2-gal model protein, was used in catalytic 100 amounts for substrate recognition, and bovine serum albumin (BSA), with a strongly nucleophilic sulfhydryl 101 group43, was supplied in excess in the recognition system to provide a model protein substrate for the reaction 102 with the quinone-methide receptor. As expected, prior to treatment with E. coli \u03b2-gal and BSA, both KSL0608-O 103 and KSL0608-Se exhibited faint fluorescence since the hydroxyl group was caged by a \u03b2-D-galactosyl group, 104 suppressing the intramolecular charge transfer (ICT) process. After treatment with E. coli \u03b2-gal, both compounds 105 exhibited negligible fluorescence changes. However, in the presence of BSA, the addition of E. coli \u03b2-gal 106 stimulated a significant fluorescence increase at 665 nm for KSL0608-O and at 721 nm for KSL0608-Se (Fig. 107 2a,b). In addition, the absorption spectra exhibited a red-shift upon the addition of both E. coli \u03b2-gal and BSA 108 (Supplementary Fig. 1). To our delight, the addition of BSA into the KSL0608-O/Se system provoked a large 109 fluorescence enhancement, while adding other nucleophilic small molecules did not (Extended Data Fig. 1a,b). 110 This should be attributed to the enhanced rigidity of the fluorophore after binding with proteins like BSA, 111 although these small-molecule species can also react with the quinone-methide receptor. Furthermore, 112\n3\nSDS-PAGE and in-gel fluorescence imaging were performed to confirm that both compounds could covalently 113 modify proteins after enzymatic activation. An intense fluorescent band was observed at the expected molecular 114 weight for BSA in the group containing KSL0608-O/KSL0608-Se, E. coli \u03b2-gal and BSA (Fig. 2c). In contrast, 115 no fluorescence signal was observed in the absence of BSA or E. coli \u03b2-gal. These results confirm that the 116 hydrolysis of the two compounds by E. coli \u03b2-gal leads to the formation of fluorescent adducts through 117 electrophilic intermediates capable of covalently reacting with surrounding proteins. 118 Emission titration experiments of both compounds with E. coli \u03b2-gal at different concentrations were then 119 conducted. A dramatic increase in the NIR fluorescence of KSL0608-O at ~665 nm was elicited by E. coli \u03b2-gal, 120 and a linear relationship between fluorescence intensity and E. coli \u03b2-gal concentration was observed, with a 121 correlation coefficient (R2) greater than 0.96 (Fig. 2d). Similarly, upon the addition of E. coli \u03b2-gal, an increase in 122 the NIR fluorescence of KSL0608-Se at ~721 nm appeared, again with a good linear relationship (R2 > 0.99) 123 (Fig. 2e). Accordingly, the limits of detection (LOD) of \u03b2-gal by KSL0608-O and KSL0608-Se were calculated 124 to be 3.12 \u00d7 10-3 U/mL and 8.96 \u00d7 10-2 U/mL, respectively (Supplementary Table 1). Furthermore, a molecular 125 docking simulation of KSL0608-O with human \u03b2-gal (PDB: 3THC) was performed. Multiple hydrogen bonds 126 form between the galactosyl group of KSL0608-O and human \u03b2-gal, and the binding model significantly 127 overlaps with that adopted by galactose (Fig. 2f,g), suggesting that KSL0608-O could be fully hydrolyzed by 128 human \u03b2-gal to release the active precursor. The above results indicated that both compounds could be activated 129 by \u03b2-gal and immobilized on proteins of interest in situ, suggesting their ability to monitor fluctuations in \u03b2-gal 130 and the feasibility of our SA-\u03b2-gal-activatable prodrug and target-site anchoring design strategy. 131 The reaction kinetics of KSL0608-O and KSL0608-Se with \u03b2-gal were further investigated. After the 132 addition of E. coli \u03b2-gal and BSA, the fluorescence intensity for the two compounds was markedly enhanced and 133 reached a maximum within 10 min (Extended Data Fig. 1c,d). Additionally, the effect of pH on the fluorescence 134 response of KSL0608-O/KSL0608-Se to \u03b2-gal over a wide pH range (4-10) was then investigated. Both 135 compounds were stable and displayed a good response to \u03b2-gal over this pH range, ensuring their ability to track 136 \u03b2-gal at physiological pH (Extended Data Fig. 1e,f). Next, their photostability for the detection of \u03b2-gal was 137 evaluated and the results indicated that both compounds exhibit high photostability and the potential to track 138 \u03b2-gal over a long duration in vivo (Extended Data Fig. 1g,h). 139 140 Photoinduced ROS generation in vitro. We then examined the ability of KSL0608-O and KSL0608-Se to 141 convert oxygen into reactive oxygen species (ROS) after photoirradiation using a commercial ROS indicator 142 1,3-diphenlisobenzofuran (DPBF)44-47. Under light irradiation, the absorption of DPBF remained constant in the 143 presence of KSL0608-O or KSL0608-Se alone, implying that neither triggers ROS generation associated toxicity 144 even when exposed to light (Fig. 2h). In contrast, the absorption of DPBF in the group containing KSL0608-Se, 145 E. coli \u03b2-gal and BSA decreased rapidly within 1 min, confirming the efficient generation of ROS once 146 KSL0608-Se was activated (Fig. 2h,i). Conversely, no significant change was observed in that of the group 147 containing KSL0608-O, E. coli \u03b2-gal and BSA, indicating that replacement of the Se atom with an O atom 148 significantly decreased the ability to generate ROS. Consistent with this, the singlet oxygen quantum yields (\u03a6\u0394) 149 of KSL0608-O and KSL0608-Se were calculated to be 0.07 and 0.20 and their relative fluorescence quantum 150 yields (\u03a6fl) were 0.33 and 0.08, after the addition of E. coli \u03b2-gal and BSA (Supplementary Table 1). These 151 results confirmed that KSL0608-Se does not produce ROS by itself, but can generate an effective photosensitive 152 drug in situ after being triggered by the target protein. 153 154 Endogenous \u03b2-gal imaging in live cells. Prior to cell imaging, the cytotoxicity of our compounds was evaluated 155 and both compounds exhibited low cytotoxicity (Supplementary Fig. 2). Human ovarian cancer cells (SKOV3) 156 with high endogenous \u03b2-gal levels, and human liver cancer cells (HepG2) containing low endogenous \u03b2-gal, were 157 incubated separately with our compounds. A marked NIR fluorescence signal was observed in SKOV3 cells, 158 whereas no significant fluorescence signal appeared in HepG2 cells (Extended Data Fig. 2a,b). D-galactose and 159 phenylethyl \u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside (PETG), two kinds of \u03b2-gal inhibitor48,49, were used to reduce the activity 160 of \u03b2-gal in cells. As expected, after treatment with each inhibitor, SKOV3 cells incubated with 161 KSL0608-O/KSL0608-Se displayed reduced fluorescence in the NIR channel (Extended Data Fig. 2c,d), 162 supporting the specificity of both compounds for detecting endogenous \u03b2-gal in live cells. 163 We then evaluated their capability to monitor \u03b2-gal activity in senescent normal cells and senescent cancer 164 cells, including human lung fibroblastic cells (MRC-5) with replication-induced senescence, and rat renal tubular 165 epithelial cells (NRK-52E), human non-small lung cancer cells (A549) and normal human liver cells (HL-7702) 166 with a senescent phenotype mediated by DNA damage. Such senescent cells with DNA damage were obtained by 167 stimulations with ROS for NRK-52E, Mitomycin C (MitoC) for A549 and doxo for HL-770214,15. After 168 incubation with KSL0608-O or KSL0608-Se, all the senescent cells emitted stronger NIR fluorescence than the 169 corresponding young cells with low expression of \u03b2-gal (Fig. 3a-c). The results of X-gal staining and western blot 170\n4\nassays for p21 and p53 of young cells and SnCs were in good agreement with the above results (Fig. 3a and 171 Supplementary Fig. 3). These results confirmed that both compounds could monitor SA-\u03b2-gal in live cells. 172 173 Lysosome-targeted function of KSL0608-O and KSL0608-Se. Senescent MRC-5 cells (P40) were 174 co-incubated with KSL0608-O or KSL0608-Se and commercial staining dyes targeting different organelles. The 175 NIR fluorescence overlapped well with the green fluorescence of LysoTracker in senescent MRC-5 cells. In 176 contrast, there was poor overlap between the fluorescence in the NIR channel and that in the green channel for 177 MitoTracker or GolgiTracker (Fig. 3d,e and Supplementary Fig. 4). These results indicated that our molecules 178 responsible for NIR fluorescence accumulated mainly in the lysosomes of SnCs, suggesting that they can 179 function in situ through enzymatic reaction with the endogenous SA-\u03b2-gal located in lysosomes. 180 181 Light-controllable removal of SnCs in a coculture system. We chose a safe dose (12 J/cm2) for the following 182 PDT experiments in living cells (Extended Data Fig. 3a-d) and confirmed the ability of this dose of light to 183 induce ROS (Fig. 4a,b). From Fig. 4c, upon light irradiation, KSL0608-Se exhibited the specific dose-dependent 184 phototoxicity to these senescent cells at 24 h. Through our treatment, over 65% of the drug-induced senescent 185 cells were killed. The KSL0608-Se-mediated PDT also exhibited phototoxicity towards P40 MRC-5 cells whose 186 senescence degree was higher than that of MRC-5 cells at P28 (Fig. 4c). We next test its cytotoxicity at 48 h and 187 72 h and found that no significant toxicity to all the young cells appeared (Extended Data Fig. 3e-l). Of note, 188 upon the prolonged incubation time, this treatment is a little phototoxic to MRC-5 cells at P28, not a low passage 189 for normal cells, but the phototoxicity was far lower than that to more senescent MRC-5 cells (P40) (Extended 190 Data Fig. 3h,l). Furthermore, no dark cytotoxicity was observed in both young and senescent cells within 3 days 191 after treatment. The above cytotoxicity test results supported our claim of the photoactivatable senolysis 192 (Extended Data Fig. 4). Flow cytometry analysis using Annexin V/PI double staining was used to further confirm 193 the selective phototoxicity of our treatment to SnCs. As expected, we observed the number of apoptotic cells 194 among the MRC-5 cells (P40) higher than that among the MRC-5 cells (P28) (Fig. 4d,e). Interestingly, the 195 KSL0608-Se-mediated PDT was desirably only sensitive to the RAW264.7 cells (a macrophage with a certain 196 \u03b2-gal expression ability) matured by drug induction, but not to the uninduced RAW264.7 cells (Supplementary 197\nFig. 5), which can be explained by the overexpression of \u03b2-gal in macrophages occurred only at the mature 198 stage50. Such in-vitro treatment on cells was conducted in PBS buffer without serum, which is a culture condition 199 of nutrient starvation with the risk of evoking cell autophagy. Thereby we evaluated effects of PBS on cells. All 200 the results indicated that PBS had negligible cytotoxicity and did not cause cell autophagy within the treatment 201 time we used (Supplementary Fig. 6), driving out this risk. 202 To further verify the specificity of KSL0608-O and KSL0608-Se to SnCs, a coculture system of SnCs and 203 young cells was built (Extended Data Fig. 5a,b), in which young cells were prelabelled with green fluorescence 204 and then cocultured with SnCs. As shown in Fig. 4f,g and Extended Data Fig. 5c-f, the young cells exhibited 205 negligible fluorescence in the NIR channel, whereas SnCs displayed bright NIR fluorescence, achieving the 206 specific labelling of SnCs. We then investigated the ability of the two compounds to specifically kill SnCs in this 207 coculture system. Cocultured cells were treated with KSL0608-Se accompanied by irradiation, and the more 208 senescent MRC-5 cells (P40) exhibited significant cell shrinkage and morphological changes that are 209 characteristic of apoptosis (Fig. 4g); however, the MRC-5 cells (P28) remained unchanged in shape. When 210 KSL0608-O was used instead of KSL0608-Se, neither the P28 MRC-5 cells nor the P40 MRC-5 cells underwent 211 a change in cell shape (Fig. 4f). These results indicated that both compounds possess the ability to recognize and 212 target SnCs, while KSL0608-Se is unique in its capacity to selectively kill SnCs. Furthermore, from 213 Supplementary Fig. 7, multiple fluorescent bands were observed over a wide molecular weight range for the 214 senescent HL-7702 cells incubated with KSL0608-O or KSL0608-Se, illustrating that the NIR-emitting products 215 were formed and successfully anchored to a variety of proteins in SnCs. 216 217 Whole-body fluorescence imaging of SnCs in vivo. Probe KSL0608-O can be activated and then emit bright 218 fluorescence under the excitation of light at almost the same wavelength as KSL0608-Se. This allows the use of 219 KSL0608-O in the in-vivo fluorescence imaging experiments in mice to verify the penetration ability of the 220 irradiation light used in the KSL0608-Se-mediated PDT to solid organs. As shown in Fig. 5a,b, the fluorescence 221 intensity in the abdomen of aged mice gradually increased over time and reached up to a maximum at 96 h, 222 whereas it was negligible in that of young mice, supporting the targeting activation of KSL0608-O in aged mice. 223 Additionally, the fluorescence intensity of liver, lung and kidney gained from aged mice was stronger than that 224 from young mice, whereas the heart and spleen from both aged and young mice displayed negligible fluorescence 225 signal (Fig. 5c,d), suggesting senescence mainly occurs in liver, lung and kidney of these aged mice. These 226 results provided the evidence that the irradiation light used in KSL0608-Se-mediated PDT has the ability to 227 penetrate tissues. 228 229\n5\nSelective removal of SnCs in a mouse model with doxo-induced senescence. We next evaluated the PDT effect 230 of KSL0608-Se in vivo against age-related pathologies (Fig. 6a). Various aging markers to evaluate the anti-aging 231 efficacy of KSL0608-Se-mediated PDT for senolysis were investigated. We assessed the expression levels of 232 \u03b3-histone-2AX (\u03b3-H2AX), a recognized age-related marker51,52. The results indicated that our treatment reduced 233 the expression of \u03b3-H2AX in the livers and kidneys of aged mice (Fig. 6b). Serum biochemical tests showed that 234 the aging induced upregulation of aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) as 235 age-associated indicators53-55 was counteracted (Fig. 6c). In addition, the PDT treatment with KSL0608-Se 236 markedly decreased the expression level of p21 and IL-1\u03b2, two other markers for aging8,53 (Fig. 6d and 237 Supplementary Fig. 8). Consistent with this observation, the expression level of SA-\u03b2-gal, as detected by both 238 X-gal and KSL0608-O staining, indicated that there were markedly fewer SnCs in the kidneys of aged mice after 239 KSL0608-Se-mediated PDT (Fig. 6e). Such results support that our treatment could effectively remove SnCs to 240 inhibit the upregulation of different age-related markers in aged mice. 241 RNA sequencing of the livers from these mice was carried out. Comparison of the gene expression in the 242 young control group and aged control group revealed 362 differentially expressed genes (Fig. 6f,g). There were 243 656 differentially expressed genes between the \u201cKSL0608-Se + irradiation\u201d group and the aged control group 244 (Fig. 6f,g). The 128 genes that were differentially expressed in both comparisons were analyzed (Supplementary 245\nFig. 9). As shown in Fig. 6h, 27 genes associated with deleterious effects of aging (SASP and fibrosis phenotypes) 246 were upregulated in doxo-treated mice and downregulated following PDT with KSL0608-Se. In addition to these 247 128 genes, 4 genes known to be associated with aging displayed similar but nonsignificant changes in expression. 248 These results strongly support KSL0608-Se as a desirable senotherapeutic agent able to delaying aging in mice 249 by reversing the expression of aging-related genes. 250 251 Selective removal of SnCs in a naturally aged mouse model. The related experiments were then carried out in 252 naturally aged mice (Fig. 7a). We first tested the levels of age-related indicators in the kidneys and livers of mice 253 in the four groups. The results of western blot analysis indicated the expression level of p53 from the 254 \u201cKSL0608-Se + irradiation\u201d group was significantly reduced while that from the KSL0608-Se group did not 255 decrease so much (Fig. 7b). We then found that p21 and SA-\u03b2-gal positive SnCs from the \u201cKSL0608-Se + 256 irradiation\u201d group was much less than those from the aged control group (Fig. 7c,d). Subsequently, we also found 257 the level of uric acid (UA), creatinine (Cr), blood urea nitrogen (BUN), ALT and AST increased in aged mice 258 (Fig. 7e,f). To our delight, the expression level of these indicators in mice from the \u201cKSL0608-Se + irradiation\u201d 259 group was downregulated, demonstrating that our treatment could counteract the age-associated loss of renal 260 function and liver function. Notably, the expression of key SASP factors in livers, kidneys and serum, including 261 CXCL1, CXCL3, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, MMP-1, MMP-7 and TNF-\u03b1, increased with age and was significantly reduced 262 after our treatment (Fig. 8a-g and Extended Data Fig. 6a-n). Additionally, p16, a cell cycle regulator whose 263 expression level increased with age, also decreased in level after treatment (Extended Data Fig. 6o). From these 264 results, the treatment used in the \u201cKSL0608-Se + irradiation\u201d group exhibited the more powerful ability to 265 decrease the level of all these indicators compared to that in the KSL0608-Se group, establishing the 266 irreplaceable role of irradiation in the treatment. Additionally, the results of hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) 267 staining assay confirmed our no-toxic treatment to the main organs of mice (Supplementary Fig. 10). The 268 KSL0608-Se-mediated PDT showed an effective photoactivatable senolysis in livers and kidneys of naturally 269 aged mice, and thus successfully ameliorated the age-associated losses of such organs. 270 Naturally aged mice showed significant declines in muscle strength, hanging endurance, locomotor activity 271 and walking speed, time and distance, while all of which were recovered after treatment with 272 KSL0608-Se-mediated PDT (Fig. 8h-k and Supplementary Fig. 11). As a control, no obvious signs of recovery in 273 mice from the KSL0608-Se group were observed. Additionally, there were no significantly cognitive alterations 274 in all groups of mice (Fig. 8k), further supporting the safety of our treatment. To be brief, our 275 KSL0608-Se-mediated PDT could markedly improve the decline symptoms of naturally aged mice in physical 276 function. 277 We then carried out the RNA sequencing analysis of differentially expressed genes in the mouse livers. By 278 comparing the gene expression in the young control group with that in the aged control group, 1399 differentially 279 expressed genes were found (Fig. 8l,m). While 578 differentially expressed genes were observed between the 280 aged control group and the \u201cKSL0608-Se + irradiation\u201d group (Fig. 8l,n). As shown in Fig. 8l and Extended Data 281\nFig. 7, there were 146 common genes in these two groups of differentially expressed genes. Among them, after 282 KSL0608-Se-mediated PDT, 18 age-related genes upregulated with age were downregulated and 6 genes 283 downregulated with age were upregulated (Fig. 8o). Another 10 genes upregulated with age, which are associated 284 with SASP and fibrosis phenotypes, also were downregulated after our treatment (Fig. 8o). The successful 285 modulation of these age-related genes further confirmed the reliability of our treatment strategy in delaying 286 natural aging. 287 288\n6\nDiscussion 289 We present a general strategy to construct senolytics, which combines the advantages of tractability, 290 broad-spectrum activity, and accuracy through the integrated use of PDT, \u03b2-gal-targeted prodrug and target-site 291 anchoring technologies. Using the strategy, we generated a smart senolytic prodrug, KSL0608-Se, that is capable 292 of being selectively activated by SA-\u03b2-gal and then bioorthogonally anchored to nearby proteins in SnCs. This 293 results in the in situ formation of a photosensitive drug with the capability of generating highly cytotoxic 1O2 and 294 emitting fluorescence in the NIR region, facilitating the fluorescence-guided photoactivatable senolysis with 295 single-cell resolution. We also developed KSL0608-O with O rather than Se as both a control molecule and an 296 excellent self-immobilizing NIR-emitting probe for the precise imaging of senescence in vivo. Compared with 297 KSL0608-O, KSL0608-Se exhibited a weaker fluorescence response but stronger phototoxicity towards SnCs, 298 confirming that the introduction of the Se atom was key to improving photosensitivity. 299 Cell imaging studies confirmed that KSL0608-Se can be activated specifically to emit NIR fluorescence in 300 different types of SnCs and exhibits the ability to distinguish SnCs from young cells. Importantly, cytotoxicity 301 and flow cytometry assays confirmed low dark toxicity of KSL0608-Se to both young cells and SnCs but high 302 phototoxicity to SnCs. From these results, KSL0608-Se exhibits high efficiency against different types of SnCs 303 (broad-spectrum activity) and minimal side effects to nonirradiated areas (tractability). In an in vitro coculture 304 system of SnCs and young cells to mimic the aging environment, we observed that only SnCs exhibited 305 non-negligible NIR emission and were destroyed after KSL0608-Se-mediated PDT for 1 h, confirming the 306 accurate fluorescence-guided senolysis by KSL0608-Se (precision). In both the X-gal and fluorescence imaging 307 assays of the kidneys of doxo-treated mice, KSL0608-Se proved efficient at reducing the percentage of 308 SA-\u03b2-gal-positive cells. Western blot assays confirmed that the expression levels of the aging marker \u03b3-H2AX 309 were significantly decreased in the kidney and liver tissues from the \u201cKSL0608-Se + irradiation\u201d group. In 310 addition, the aging markers p21 and IL-1\u03b2, and the liver damage indicators AST and ALT, were inhibited after 311 KSL0608-Se-mediated PDT according to the results of RT-qPCR and serum tests. Consistent with these results, 312 we found through RNA sequencing that our treatment attenuated the expression of 31 senescence-associated 313 genes in livers of the doxo group. We further tried treating naturally aged mice whose aging symptoms are 314 usually more difficult to be improved than those of the mice with drug-induced senescence. As evident from the 315 results of X-gal and IF assays, the KSL0608-Se-mediated PDT successfully eliminated the SnCs in livers and 316 kidneys of the naturally aged mice. Our treatment also desirably inhibited the upregulation of various age-related 317 markers, which was supported by the results of western blot and ELISA assays. In addition, it played the 318 counteraction against the age-induced losses in liver function and renal function and achieved the recovery of the 319 age-associated physical dysfunctions. Most notably, 34 key age-related genes in livers of naturally aged mice 320 were inhibited, suggesting the powerful ability of our strategy to treat signs of natural aging. 321 These successes in mice confirm our strategy to monitor and selectively eliminate SnCs to regulate aging. 322 Since our treatment regime is photoactivated and thus non-invasive, the biological effects depend on the 323 wavelength of the light irradiation absorbed by the photosensitive drug. One major concern is that for translation 324 of this treatment for deep tissues and organs of larger species the 535 nm light irradiation used could result in 325 limited tissue penetration, nevertheless we believe that KSL0608-Se can be successfully applied for the PDT of 326 skin, muscle and superficial organs of large species. With our future research we intend to extend the absorption 327 wavelength of the photosensitive drug to the NIR region enabling improved tissue penetration to facilitate full 328 body treatment of larger species. 329 Overall, our results indicate that KSL0608-Se is a potent senolytic drug with the advantages of tractability, 330 broad-spectrum activity, and precision. The unprecedented integrated strategy provides a paradigm for the 331 development of senolytics that can overcome the limitations of regular senolytics. Another crucial insight that has 332 emerged from our research is that PDT as an approach for senolysis and scavenging SnCs has numerous 333 advantages over traditional senolytics, particularly if it is based on the integrated use of emerging technologies 334 for the design of senolytic agents. As such, our strategy not only provides a route for eliminating SnCs but also 335 provides the basis for PDT to precisely regulate aging. 336 337 338 Methods 339 Statement of ethical regulations. All animal experiments were performed in accordance with institutional guidelines and were 340 approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committees of Tongji University in compliance with Chinese law for 341 experimental animals with an approval number of SYXK (Shanghai) 2020-0002. 342 343 Preparation of the spectral measurements. KSL0608-O and KSL0608-Se were respectively dissolved in DMSO to obtain stock 344 solutions (1 mM) and diluted to 10 \u03bcM for all spectral studies. E. coli \u03b2-gal was dissolved in phosphate buffer saline (PBS) buffer 345 (pH = 7.4, 10 \u03bcM) to obtain 10 U/mL stock solutions. Similar, stock solutions of BSA (10 mg/mL) were prepared in PBS buffer (pH 346 = 7.4, 10 mM). PBS buffers with different pH values including 4.74, 5.66, 6.86, 7.40, 8.05, 8.68 and 10.07 were prepared using 347\n7\nstandard procedures. Absorption and fluorescence spectra of those compounds with E. coli \u03b2-gal were performed at 37 \u00baC in a 2 mL 348 total volume of PBS buffer (10 \u03bcM, pH 7.4) containing 1 mg/mL BSA in a 1 cm cuvette. 349 350 Calculation of the LOD. The LOD was determined from the fluorescence titration data based on an acknowledged method. The 351 plots of fluorescence intensity of KSL0608-O and KSL0608-Se toward different concentrations of E. coli \u03b2-gal, all showed a good 352 linear relationship (with R2 greater than 0.96), and the LOD was calculated using the following equation: 353 LOD = 3\u03c3/k 354 where \u03c3 is the standard deviation of eleven blank measurements and k is the slope of the linear equation. 355 356 Calculation of the \u03a6fl. The \u0424fl of KSL0608-O/KSL0608-Se before and after the addition of E. coli \u03b2-gal and BSA was determined 357 by comparison with the fluorescence of fluorescein (\u0424fl,st = 0.95 in 0.1 M NaOH). The \u0424fl was calculated according to following 358 equation56: 359\n\u0424 , = \u0424 , ( ) 360\nwhere subscripts x and st represent the sample to be tested, respectively. F is the integrated fluorescence emission. A represents the 361 absorbance of compound at its respective excitation wavelengths. 362 363 Calculation of the \u03a6\u2206. The \u03a6\u2206 was determined using chlorin e6 (Ce6) as a reference and 1,3-diphenylisobenzofuran (DPBF) as a 364 ROS trapping agent. DPBF (abs < 1.00), and KSL0608-O or KSL0608-Se (10 \u03bcM) were added in a cuvette containing air-saturated 365 solvents and the solutions were kept in the dark until the absorbance reading was stable, followed by continuous light irradiation 366 (535 nm, 10 mW/cm2) at 5 s intervals. The \u03a6\u2206 was calculated by following equation57,58: 367\n\u0424\u2206, = \u0424\u2206, 368\nwhere subscripts x and st represent the sample to be tested and the standard reference Ce6 (\u03a6\u2206,st = 0.65), respectively. S is the slope 369 of the absorption curve of DPBF at the wavelength of 410 nm over time. F is the absorption correction factor, which is given by F = 370 1\u201310\u2013OD (OD represents the optical density of sample and Ce6 at 535 nm). 371 372 Cell culture. MRC-5 cells, HepG2 cells, RAW264.7 cells, A549 cells and SKOV3 cells were purchased from Cell Bank of Chinese 373 Academy. HL-7702 cells were purchased from Shanghai FuHeng BioLogy Co., Ltd. NRK-52E cells were purchased from Procell 374 Life Science&Technology Co., Ltd. MRC-5 cells were cultured in MEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Gibco), 1% 375 penicillin/streptomycin (Yeasen), 1 mM sodium pyruvate solution (BI), and 1% non-essential amino acids solution (BI). SKOV3 376 cells, A549 cells and HL-7702 cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 (HyClone) medium supplemented with 10% FBS and 1% 377 penicillin/streptomycin. NRK-52E cells, RAW264.7 cells and HepG2 cells were cultured in DMEM (Gibco) medium supplemented 378 with 10% FBS and 1% penicillin/streptomycin. All cells were cultured and maintained at 37 \u00b0C with 5% CO2. To obtain 379 drug-induced senescent cells, A549 cells were stimulated with MitoC (0.5 \u03bcM) twice for two days and HL-7702 cells were treated 380 with doxo (1 \u03bcM) for 1 day. NRK-52E cells were stimulated with 150 nM H2O2 for 1 day and cultured for 2 days to induce 381 senescence. To obtain mature RAW 264.7 cells, RAW 264.7 cells were stimulated by Lipopolysaccharide (Lps, 50 ng/mL) and 382 interferon-\u03b3 (INF-\u03b3, 100 ng/mL) for 3 days59. 383 384 Cytotoxicity assay. The percentage cell survival of these cells after treatment with KSL0608-O or KSL0608-Se was assessed by 385 using a Cell Counting Kit-8 (CCK-8) assay. Cells were seeded into a 96-well plate at 6000 cells per well and treated with 386 KSL0608-O and KSL0608-Se at different concentrations for 24 h. For irradiation experiment, the cells were separately incubated 387 with KSL0608-Se in PBS buffer for 30 min, followed by irradiation with an LED lamp (535 nm, 10 mW/cm2) for 20 min. Then, the 388 PBS buffer was removed from the petri dish and the culture medium was added into the dish, the cells were further incubated in the 389 incubator for 24 h, 48 h and 72 h, respectively. As a control experiment, all these cells were treated with PBS buffer for different 390 times. Then the PBS buffer was replaced by the culture medium and further incubated in the incubator for 24 h. For cytotoxicity 391 tests, the culture medium was removed, 10 \u03bcL of CCK-8 solution was added to each well, and the 96-plates were incubated at 37 \u00b0C 392 with 5% CO2 for 2 h. A Microplate Reader (Bio-Tek Instruments, Synergy H1) was employed to record the absorbance of each well 393 at 450 nm. The percentage cell survival was evaluated by measuring the absorbance at 450 nm and calculated by the formula 394 (percentage cell survival = (ODpositive \u2212 ODcontrol)/(ODnegative \u2212 ODcontrol)). All experiments were carried out at least in triplicate. 395 396 Influences of autophagy process. To ensure the reliability of our treatment, we have further evaluated the cytotoxicity of PBS on 397 senescent/young cells at different treatment times. The cells were treated with PBS buffer for different times and the cytotoxicity of 398 PBS to these cells was evaluated by CCK8 assays. AF-C, an autophagy-pH-sensitive ratiometric fluorescence probe60,61, was used 399 to monitor the autophagy process of cells in PBS buffer within 2 h. The PBS-treated cells were incubated with AF-C (20 \u03bcM) for 15 400 min and then imaged by a Leica TCS SP8 SMD confocal microscope. 401 402\n8\nConfocal imaging. Cells were plated on a glass-bottomed cell culture dish (NEST Biotechnology, 801001) and incubated with 403 normal medium for 1-2 days. Then, the medium was replaced with PBS buffer containing 10 \u03bcM (or 5 \u03bcM) probe (KSL0608-O or 404 KSL0608-Se) and incubated for 30 min. Then the above cells were washed with PBS for three times. The tissue sections were 405 immersed in a PBS buffer containing 10 \u03bcM probe (KSL0608-O) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C, and then washed with PBS buffer and mounted 406 with 75% glycerol. The fluorescence imaging of cells and tissue sections were performed by a Leica TCS SP8 SMD confocal 407 microscope and a Nikon csu-w1 sora confocal microscope, respectively. 408 MRC-5 cells (P28) and young HL-7702 cells were stained with 5 \u03bcM CellTracker Green CMFDA (Yeasen, 40721ES50) for 20 409 min, respectively. The above CMFDA-stained young cells and senescent cells were co-cultured for 1 day. Then, the co-cultured cells 410 were incubated with KSL0608-O (10 \u03bcM) or KSL0608-Se (10 \u03bcM) for 30 min and fluorescence imaging was carried out. 411 412 X-gal staining assay. Cultured cells were washed with PBS once and fixed for 10 min at room temperature in 4% formaldehyde and 413 2% glutaraldehyde. Then, after washing three times with PBS, MRC-5 cells, HL-7702 cells, A549 cells, NRK-52E cells were 414 respectively incubated with SA-\u03b2-gal staining solution (1 mg/mL X-gal, pH = 6.0) overnight at 37 \u00b0C and RAW 264.7 cells were 415 incubated with \u03b2-gal staining solution (1 mg/mL X-gal, pH = 4) for 7 h at 37 \u00b0C. Additionally, the frozen sections were dried at 416 37 \u00b0C for 15 min and then fixed with 2% formaldehyde and 0.2% glutaraldehyde in PBS for 10 min. Subsequently, the sections were 417 washed with PBS for three times and then incubated with 1 mg/mL X-gal staining solution (pH = 6.0 for kidney sections, pH = 4.0 418 for liver sections62) overnight at 37 \u00b0C. After completion of \u03b2-gal staining, the sections were washed using PBS for three times. The 419 images of X-gal-staining were collected using a Ti-S microscope (Nikon). 420 421 Flow cytometric assay. MRC-5 cells were seeded in culture plates and were cultured for 24 h. Then the cells were incubated with 422 KSL0608-Se (10 \u00b5M) for 30 min and then were exposed under an LED lamp (535 nm, 10 mW/cm2) for 20 min. Cells were further 423 cultured for 5 h and were digested by trypsin-EDTA solution. Finally, the above cells were washed with PBS, and stained with PI 424 and Annexin V-FITC following the protocol (Bytotime Biotechnology, C2015M). Then the samples were analyzed by flow 425 cytometry (CytoFLEX LX, Beckman Coulter, CA, USA). 426 427 Drug treatment in vivo. C57BL/6J mice (male and female, 2-month-old and 21-month-old) were purchased from Charles River 428 Laboratory Animal Co., Ltd, maintained under specific pathogen-free facility (SPF) at 25 \u00b0C and 40-60% humidity conditions with a 429 12 h light/12 h dark cycle and free access to food and water. 430 KSL0608-O or KSL0608-Se was mixed in mixture solution containing 70% normal saline, 25% castor oil and 5% DMSO. 431 Doxo was dissolved in normal saline. All drugs were administered to the mice by intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection. 432 To construct mouse model with doxo-induced senescence, doxo (3 mg/kg) was administrated to mice (male) once on the day 1 433 and day 10. Then, KSL0608-Se (20 mg/kg) was administrated to aged mice on the day 24. And the mice were sacrificed on 434 thirty-eighth day. For young mice and naturally aged mice (female), mice were divided into the young (2-month-old) control group, 435 the aged (21-month-old) control group to be treated with vehicle, the KSL0608-Se group (21-month-old) to be treated with 436 KSL0608-Se (10 mg/kg), and the \u201cKSL0608-Se + irradiation\u201d group (21-month-old) to be treated with both KSL0608-Se (10 437 mg/kg) and irradiation. Both the vehicle and KSL0608-Se were administrated by intraperitoneal injection once every two weeks and 438 for eight weeks. According to the in-vivo imaging results using KSL0608-O, the mice of \u201cKSL0608-Se + irradiation\u201d group were 439 irradiated four times every two weeks after the administration of KSL0608-Se. All mice were sacrificed on 68 days. For imaging 440 experiments in vivo, mice aged 2 months and 21 months (male, n = 3) were intraperitoneally injected with KSL0608-O (20 mg/kg), 441 respectively. 442 443 Tissue sections and blood samples. Main organs of mice (heart, liver, spleen, lung and kidney) were isolated, washed with PBS, 444 and transferred to liquid nitrogen. All these organs were paraffin-embedded with paraffin and sectioned into 5 \u03bcm slices for H&E 445 staining. The frozen kidneys and livers were sliced at -20 \u00b0C and sectioned into 20-\u03bcm-thick sections using a cryocut microtome 446 (CRYOSTAR NX50, Thermo) and mounted onto glass slides (Servicebio). The sections were stored at -20 \u00b0C and used in one day. 447 Additionally, the blood samples of all mice were collected and stewed for 1 h at room temperature. Then, the blood samples were 448 centrifuged (3000 g, 20 min) at 4 \u00b0C to obtain serum. 449 450 PDT and imaging in vivo. The PDT experiments were performed on in vivo fluorescence imaging system (Perkin Elmer IVIS 451 Spectrum CT imaging system) with an excitation wavelength at 535 nm for 20 min. The hair on the back and abdomen of mice was 452 shaved. Then, the mice were anaesthetized with isoflurane and were placed on the loading platform of instrument (3-4 mice at a 453 time), followed by intermittent irradiation using sequence imaging mode (Excitation filter: 535; Subject size: 1.5; Field of view: 454 22.4). The mice with doxo-induced senescence were irradiated once a day for three consecutive days after the administration of 455 KSL0608-Se. The naturally aged mice were irradiated once a day for four consecutive days after the administration of KSL0608-Se. 456 The PDT treatment was performed on day 24, 25 and 26 for mice with doxo-induced senescence and was carried out on day 1, 2, 3, 457 4, 15, 16, 17, 18, 29, 30, 31, 32, 43, 44, 45 and 46 for naturally aged mice. 458 The imaging experiments in those mice were performed on in vivo fluorescence imaging system (Perkin Elmer IVIS Spectrum 459 CT imaging system) (Ex: 535 nm, Em: 640-660 nm). The hair on the back and abdomen of mice was shaved. The images were taken 460 on at 1 h, 12 h, 24 h, 72 h and 96 h after injection. Then, these mice were sacrificed and their major organs (heart, liver, spleen, lung 461\n9\nand kidney) were harvested and subjected to ex vivo imaging. 462 463 Western blot analysis. The prepared liver and kidney samples of mice were placed in grinders. Total protein was extracted using 464 RIPA lysis buffer containing protease inhibitor. The concentration of protein was quantified by BCA protein assay kit (Yeasen). After 465 mixing the SDS-PAGE protein loading buffer, the solution was heated at 100 \u00baC for 10 min. Then, samples with equal protein 466 amount were added into the wells with 10% (or 12%) SDS-PAGE gel and were separated and transferred to a PVDF membrane. The 467 membranes were then blocked and incubated with primary antibody (\u03b3-H2AX: Abcam, ab81299, 1/10000 dilution; p21: Cell 468 Signaling Technology, 2947S, 1/1000 dilution; p53: Santa Cruz, sc-126, 1/1000 dilution; GAPDH: Abclonal, ac033, 1/2000 dilution) 469 at 4 \u00b0C overnight and then was washed with TBST for five times. After incubating with secondary antibodies (Anti-rabbit IgG 470 antibody, CST, 7074P2; Goat anti-Mouse IgG antibody, Arigo, ARG65350) for 1 h, the membranes were imaged using an imaging 471 system (Tanon-4600SF). 472 473 Reverse transcription (RT)-quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR). The prepared liver and kidney samples of mice were placed in 474 grinders. Total RNA was extracted using RNA Isolation Kit (Omega, Biotek) according to the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. cDNA 475 was generated by using Hifair II 1st strand cDNA synthesis supermax for qPCR (gDNA digester plus) (Yesen). RT\u2013qPCR was 476 performed using Hieff UNICON\u00ae Universal Blue qPCR SYBR Green Master Mix (Yesen) on a qPCR detecting system (BIO-RAD, 477 CFX96) by following the manufacturer\u2019s instructions. 478 Four biological repeats were conducted for each group. The test procedure was in accordance with the instruction of kit. GAPDH 479 was used as a control to normalize the expression of target genes. The primers (Sangon Biotech) used are listed as follows: 480 GADPH, forward: GTGGCAAAGTGGAGATTGTTG; 481 reverse: AGTCTTCTGGGTGGCAGTGAT. 482 p21, forward: CAGATCCACAGCGATATCCA; 483 reverse: ACGGGACCGAAGAGACAAC. 484 IL-1\u03b2, forward: TGCCACCTTTTGACAGTGATG; 485 reverse: TGATGTGCTGCTGCGAGATT. 486 487 Immunofluorescence staining. Kidney and liver samples for immunofluorescence staining assays were incubated with primary 488 antibody (p21: Cell Signaling Technology, 2947S, 1/200) at 4 \u00baC overnight, washed three times with PBS and then incubated with 489 appropriate secondary antibodies (Anti-rabbit IgG antibody, CST, 7074P2, 1/500) for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C. And then the samples were 490 stained by Hoechst. 491 492 ELISA analysis. SASP factors (IL-6\u3001IL-1\u03b2\u3001CXCL1\u3001CXCL3\u3001MMP-1\u3001MMP-7 and TNF-\u03b1), and cell cycle regulators p16 493 (CDKN2A) in serum, liver or kidney were monitored using ELISA Kit (RF6857, RF7630, RF8477, RF7606, RF7480, RF7678, 494 RF7722, RF6978). AST, ALT, UA, Cr and BUN in serum were teste using ELISA Kit (RF8502, RF8547, RF8520, RF8275, 495 RF8274). All ELISA Kits were purchased in Shanghai ruifan Biological Technology Co, Ltd. And the data of ELISA analysis were 496 collected by this company. 497 498 Physical function measurements. All functional assays were conducted one week before the sacrifice of mice. 499 The rotarod test was performed using an accelerating RotaRod system (Shanghai XinRuan Information Technology Co., Ltd, 500 XR-6C). Mice were placed in separate lanes on the rod rotating at an initial speed of 4 rpm/min and then the speed accelerated from 501 4 to 40 rpm/min in 300 s. The time, speed and distance were recorded when the mouse fell to the bottom of machine. All mice were 502 trained once a day for three consecutive days (day 1, 2 and 3) and the test were recorded on day 4, 5 and 6. The results were 503 averaged from 3 trials. 504 The grip strength of mice was measured by a grid strength meter (Shanghai XinRuan Information Technology Co., Ltd, XR501). 505 Mice were placed in the grid of the machine and grasped the grid with all four paws. The meter recorded the peak tension over six 506 trials. The test was performed once a day for three consecutive days and the results were averaged from 3 trials. 507 For the Y-maze spontaneous-alternation test, the mice were placed in the centre of a Y-shaped maze (XinRuan Information 508 Technology Co., Ltd, XR-XY1032). The mice are allowed to explore all three arms freely. The number of arm entries and sequences 509 of arm visits of mice within 8 min were recorded and analyzed. 510 To perform the hanging test, mice were kept to grab a 2-mm-thick metal wire (35 cm above a padded surface) with their 511 forelimbs only and recorded the hanging duration. Hanging time was normalized to body weight as hanging duration (sec) \u00d7 body 512 weight (g), and the results were averaged from 3 trials for each mouse. 513 514 RNA sequencing. For the PDT experiments on doxo-treated mice and naturally aged mice, the liver samples of mice in different 515 groups were collected for RNA sequencing in Shanghai Majorbio Bio-pharm Technology Co., Ltd. Data was analyzed using the free 516 online platform of Majorbio Cloud Platform. The accession number for RNA-seq reported in this paper is GEO: GSE186522 and 517 GSE213846. 518 519 Statistics and reproducibility.
