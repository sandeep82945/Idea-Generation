    "abstractText": "The lack of suitable functional groups for cell adhesion on the surface of Polycaprolactone (PCL) is one of the main limitations in order to use PCL for biomedical applications. The aim of this research is to modify the PCL film surface using arginine, via an aminolysis reaction. In this regard, after PCL films formation by casting method, they were immersed in arginine solutions of various concentration at room temperature or then heated to 40 \u25e6C and in the presence of isopropanol or without it. To assess the structure of the modified surface, its wettability, and mechanical properties, methods of measuring the contact angle and the strip tensile test were used, and to compare the degree of attachment and the rate of cell proliferation, the method of fluorescent staining of cultured cells was used. The change in protein synthesis by cells on the modified surface was assessed using Western blotting. The results obtained show that the treatment of PCL films with an aqueous solution of arginine at room temperature for 1 day increases the hydrophilicity of the surface. Wherein surface modification led to a two-fold decrease of mechanical strength and flow stress, but elongation increase by about 30% for PCL films after modification in 0.5 M aqueous arginine solution at room temperature. Moreover, cell attachment and proliferation, as well as collagen synthesis, were significantly enhanced after arginine modification. The proposed simple and effective method for modifying PCL films with arginine significantly expands the possibilities for developing biocompatible scaffolds for tissue engineering.",

Since the surface of a biomaterial is in direct contact with the biological environment, foreign body reactions completely depend on surface characteristics of this biomaterial [5]. There are many techniques for surface modification of hydrophobic PCL scaffolds. The most common are physical coating, plasma etching, hydrolysis to physically and chemically immobilize bioactive compounds such as peptides, proteins and polysaccharides [6,7]. Among these methods the aminolysis\nPolymers 2022, 14, 4654. https://doi.org/10.3390/polym14214654 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/polymers\nPolymers 2022, 14, 4654 2 of 15\nis more convenient compared to monomer design and synthesis while brings minimum influence of bulk properties. There are a large number of ester groups (-COO-) in PCL molecules. These groups can be hydrolysed to carboxylic acid under aminolysis [8]. The amino groups can be introduced onto the polyester surface by a reaction with diamine, providing that one amino group reacts with the -COO- group to form a covalent bond, -CONH-, while the other amino group is unreacted and free. Some advantages in tissue engineering can be expected by the steady introduction of these amino groups: (1) nontoxic to cells or tissues; (2) decreasing the surface hydrophobicity; (3) neutralizing the acid generated during the scaffold degradation and reducing the inflammation around the implanted scaffold; (4) providing active sites through which other biomolecules. 1,6-hexamethylenediamine and 1,2-ethylenediamine are used as a source of diamines [8,9]. Our research group is among the first to utilize L-arginine containing 2 terminal amino groups, to introduce primary amine groups to PCL [10]. Arginine is closely tied to several metabolic pathways involved in the synthesis of urea, polyamines, nitric oxide, agmatine, and creatine phosphate [11,12]. Our group and other researchers showed, that temperature and polarity of solvents noticeably influence the aminolysis process [13,14]. We have shown that the amount of arginine bound to the polymer surface increases at elevated temperatures. Moreover, we have shown that the presence of isopropyl alcohol increases the intensity of the aminolysis reaction. However, it should be noted that, in parallel with the aminolysis reaction, the hydrolysis reaction also takes place. As a result, ester bonds also dissolve, and carboxyl COO and hydroxyl OH groups form. Heating and isopropyl alcohol accelerate the hydrolysis reaction. As a result modification of polycaprolactone films with arginine increases the number of adhering cells and the number of focal contacts after 1 day of cultivation. The question of degradation of films during their treatment with a modifying agent in an aqueous solution always remains open and important, since even partial degradation of PCL films leads to a change in their mechanical characteristics. Degradation of poly(\u03b1hydroxyesters) and, in particular, PCL is stimulated by the specific action of water. Two mechanisms of PCL decomposition are considered in the literature. The first mechanism is characterized by the destruction of the surface of the polymer film, while the rate of hydrolytic splitting of macromolecules on the surface of the film is significantly higher than the rate of diffusion of water into the volume of the film. The second mechanism, on the contrary, is characterized by a sufficiently rapid penetration of water molecules into the volume of the film and, consequently, a uniform hydrolytic degradation over the entire volume of the PCL film [15]. PCL is characterized by hydrolytic degradation, as a result of which the size of polymer chains is reduced, carboxyl end groups are formed and water-soluble decomposition products such as 6-hydroxylcaproic acid are obtained [16]. During hydrolysis, degradation products can both escape into the surrounding water environment and diffuse into the polymer film and, thus, catalyze the process of volumetric degradation of the polymer film [17]. Mathematical models for predicting the rate of hydrolytic degradation of polyesters are presented in the scientific literature [18]. Previously, the results of both volumetric degradation of PCL films and PCL films with a modified surface were also published [19]. As shown above, in the process of the aminolysis reaction and under the action of isopropyl alcohol presented in the reaction medium, there is a rupture of ester bonds in the result of which the macromolecule is shortened. It can be expected that as a result of such treatment, not only the surface properties of polycaprolactone films, but also the mechanical properties change. The question of the further functioning of cells on modified films also remains unresolved. Adhesion and proliferation of cells on polymer substrates are certainly important, but they are not the only parameters for assessing the interaction of MSCs cells with the polymer surface. To form tissue in vitro after attachment, cells must themselves synthesize extracellular matrix proteins.\nPolymers 2022, 14, 4654 3 of 15\nIn this study, we clarify the following major concerns: (1) how do aminolysis reaction conditions, namely arginine concentration, temperature and polarity of solvent, affect on mechanical properties of PCL films; (2) its effect on the surface properties of PCL films, namely, hydrophilicity and the ability to sorb proteins; and (3) how the formed functional groups effect on the MSCs\u2019 behaviour during long-term cultivation. Understanding these basic principles is essential to better use the arginine modification method to develop advanced biomaterials."

            "text": "The water contact angles on the PCL films measured by a sessile drop technique are\nlisted in Figure 1. The hydrophilicity of the PCL films was enhanced significantly after\nsurface treatments by hydrolysis and aminolysis.\nIn Figure 1 it is seen the contact angle of films processed at room temperature depends slightly on the presence of arginine or alcohol in the solution. When the PCL films are incubated in pure water for 1 day, the contact angle decreases by almost 10 degrees to 58 degrees. The greater hydrophilicity of these films was attributed to the additional carboxylate (-COO-) and hydroxyl (-OH) groups on the PCL surface, which were initially resulted from the hydrolysis. It has been established, that alkaline hydrolysis increases surface hydrophilicity [21]. Under these conditions the influence of water molecules makes the largest contribution to the hydrophilicity of PCL films increase. Only the presence of a high concentration of arginine in an aqueous solution (0.5 M) reduces the wetting angle by another 2 degrees and reach angle as large as 56 degrees. Isopropyl alcohol also makes the same insignificant contribution to reducing the wetting angle. Thus, the presence of alcohol in the solution helps to reduce the wetting angle by 2\u20133 degrees. Modification of PCL films by arginine solution when heated to 40 \u25e6C both arginine and isopropyl alcohol, make a significant contribution to the increase in hydrophilicity (Figure 1b). In contrast to treatment at room temperature for 24 h (Figure 1a), treatment upon heating after 1 h leads to a decrease in the contact angle by 5 degrees both in water and in the presence of isopropyl alcohol. In contrast to processing at room temperature, the aminolysis reaction, namely arginine, makes a significant contribution to the increase in the hydrophilicity of PCL films. Films treated with a solution with a maximum arginine content (0.5 M) have a maximum hydrophilicity. The contact angle of PCL films modified with a 0.5 M solution of arginine is 47 degrees. It should be noted that the conditions we developed for the modification of PCL films in the presence of arginine make it possible to obtain surfaces with a high degree of hydrophilicity. Moreover, the contact angle of PCLmodified arginine films is lower compared to similar films treated with other diamines. So H. Zhang, S. Hollister has been shown that PCL films treated with 1,6-hexanediamine have a contact angle of 66 degrees [22]. The modification of such RGD films with peptides allows one to obtain polymer wetting surfaces of which is 44 degrees. Yuan et al. also treated\nPolymers 2022, 14, 4654 6 of 15\nPCL films with a 1.6-hexanediamine solution and showed that this treatment reduces the contact angle to 67 degrees. But films with higher hydrophilicity can be obtained only after additional immobilization of collagen molecules on the amino groups. The contact angle of collagen-modified PCL films was 44 degrees [23]. The modification of films by isopropyl alcohol with heating does not significantly contribute to the contact angle value. Only a combination of isopropyl alcohol and a 0.25 M arginine solution will increase the hydrophilicity of modified PCL films corresponding to a contact angle of 57 degrees. It should be noted that the contact angle data for argininemodified films are also lower compared to the contact angles of films treated with other diamines [23,24]."

Modification of PCL in distilled water at 40 \u00b0C allows maintaining the tensile strength of the sample almost at the initial level, \u03c3\u0440 = 8 MPa. Modification of PCL in distilled water at room temperature decreases the tensile strength of the sample in 3 times compered with initial PCL, \u03c3\u0440 = 3 MPa. Almost the same change in tensile strength is observed for PCL samples modified with a water-alcohol solution and a water-alcohol screen in the presence of 0.25 M arginine. When modifying these samples at a temperature of 40 \u00b0C, the \u03c3\u0440 is 5 MPa, when modified at room temperature, the tensile strength decreases by 4 and 3 MPa, respectively. As is true for all specimens described, modification at 25 \u00b0C results in a more significant reduction in tensile strength compared to modification at 40 \u00b0C. While for a sample modified with water and 0.5 M an increase in temperature leads to a decrease in the tensile strength of the sample by 2 times. \u03c3\u0440 modified 0.5 M arginine in water at room temperature is 6 MPa, and when modified at 40 \u00b0C \u03c3\u0440 = 3 MPa. As a result of the measurements, data were obtained indicating a decrease in the tensile strength for almost all films after modification. Indeed, it is known that the degradation of PCL is stimulated by the specific action of water and the phenomenon of diffusion and reactions that occur within the material. Two distinct processes are observed: (1) a surface degradation where the diffusion of water in the polymer volume is extremely slow compared to the hydrolytic cleavage reaction and (2) mass degradation where water is able to penetrate through the entire polymer so that random hydrolytic chain splits take place uniformly throughout the matrix [25]. The degradation of PCL is carried out by hydrolysis: the PCL chains are cleaved at the ester bonds, forming carboxyl terminal groups and thereby reducing the size of the molecular chains and yielding water-soluble degradation products such as 6-hydroxylcaproic acid [16,25,26]. According to the tensile strength data, the samples had the lowest values of this parameter after their processing at 25 \u00b0C\nFigure 2. Stress-strain curves of PCL films before and after the hydrolysis and aminolysis treatment. (A)\u201440 \u25e6C \u0438 (B)\u201425 \u25e6C.\nIt should be noted that the modification leads to a decrease in the voltage value for all samples under the influence of all modifying factors, starting with water treatment at room temperature and ending with an arginine solution in an aqueous alcohol solution when heated to 40 \u25e6C. If in the control sample we observed voltage values within 9 MPa, then when exposed to an aqueous solution of arginine both at room temperature and when heated, the voltage values decrease by half for some samples. Moreover, both in the presence of water and alcohol, these values decrease significantly. We assume that such a significant decrease in voltage is due to a sufficiently active not only s rface, but also volumetric egradatio of the PCL film.

According to the tensile strength data, the samples had the lowest values of this parameter after their processing at 25 \u25e6C during 8 h. Apparently, this is due to the duration of processing at room temperature, compared with 1 h of processing at 40 \u25e6C. With longer processing, in addition to the influence of temperature, arginine and isopropyl alcohol concentrations, degradation by-products also effect. When the by-products diffuse into the medium, the degradation, and, therefore, the decrease in the molecular weight throughout the sample are homogeneous, creating a balance between diffusion and hydrolysis reactions [27]. In the case where the by-products do not diffuse into the medium and remain trapped in the mass of the polymer, the presence of the carboxylic acids will catalyze hydrolysis [26].

We assume that in the presence of isopropyl alcohol, hydrolysis of PCL macromolecules occurs not only on the surface, but also in deeper layers of polymer films. The elongation at break of the original PCL is 100%. The elongation at break of PCL samples modified at room temperature in distilled water and in a water-alcohol solution is at the same level. Increasing the modification temperature to 40 \u25e6C for these samples leads to a decrease in \u03b5p to 80%. The presence of arginine 0.25 M during modified in a water-alcohol solution leads to a decrease in the elasticity of PCL, and with an increase in temperature, this effect is more significant. The elongation at break of a sample modified at room temperature is 75%, at a temperature of 40 \u25e6C \u03b5p = 40%. Modification of PCL with 0.5 M arginine in distilled water solution at 40 \u25e6C makes it possible to maintain the elongation at break at the initial level, and even increase it by 30% at room temperature. The initial sample of PCL and modified in distilled water at a temperature of 40 \u25e6C have a Young\u2019s modulus of 125 MPa. The use of other types of PCL modification leads to a decrease in the rigidity of PCL samples by an average of 30%. A similar dependence of the Young\u2019s modulus on hydrolytic degradation was observed by other authors [15]. The authors of this study demonstrated a decrease in the Young\u2019s modulus in the first period of hydrolytic degradation, but then the rate of decrease in the Young\u2019s modulus decreases."

The study of cell morphology showed that cells can still grow on modified surfaces, which is probably due to increased surface hydrophilicity and the presence of amino and hydroxyl groups. Moreover, it has been already demonstrated that arginine modification can modulate the MSC morphology, adhesion, and activity [10]. After 1 day of cultivation, the cells in all samples are well flattened and have an elongated fibroblast-like shape characteristic to MSCs (Figure 4). 3 days after seeding, the largest number of cells was on PCL films treated with arginine solution at heating (Figure 5). The cell proliferation after 3 days of cultivation on PCL films modified with an arginine solution in water is inversely proportional to the arginine concentration. In contrast to the results of proliferation, the number of cells after 24 h after seeding, the number of adherent cells on PCL films treated with arginine solution in water increased in proportion to an increase in the concentration of arginine solution. Thus, a high concentration of arginine on the PCL surface promotes cell adhesion to the modified surface in the first hours after seeding, but reduces proliferative activity during longer cultivation. The optimal amount of arginine on the film surface is 0.1 \u00b5g per 1 cm of surface.\nPolymers 2022, 14, 4654 9 of 15 Polymers 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 17\nPolymers 2022, 14, 4654 10 of 15 Polymers 2022, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 11 of 17\n5.

Therefore, it is important to investigate whether PCL surface with immobilized arginine could promote MSCs to synthesize fibronectin and facilitate the proliferation of the cells on the polymer surfaces. On day 3 after cell seeding, Western blotting assay show the maximum amount of deposited cellular fibronectin on PCL films hydrolyzed in water at room temperature and treated in 0.1 M arginine solution at water and at room temperature too (Figure 7).

Films modification by arginine solutions such room temperature (25 \u25e6C) as 40 \u25e6C promote cellular fibronectin deposition compare to cells seeded on pristine PCL films or glass (Figure 7a). Surface chemistry is known to affect the adhesion, proliferation, and migration of a variety of cells [35\u201338]. Wherein its effect on the deposition of both collagen I and IV has not been explored. Surface chemistry is also known to affect protein adsorption [39,40], while collagen deposition by cells is an active, not a passive process [41]. These data suggest that PCL surface, treated by arginine solutions in isopropanol, either encourages formation adhesion of MSCs focal contacts or more favorable for collagen I deposition in early stage of growth. Despite the fact that arginine modification improves the synthesis of collagen I by MSCs, it does not affect the deposition of collagen IV. In some cases, modification with arginine even leads to a decrease in the synthesis of collagen IV on the treated films compared to pristine PCL (Figure 7c)."

            "heading": "6. Conclusions",
            "text": "Modification of the surface of PCL films was carried out by the reaction of aminolysis. The natural amino acid arginine was used as a source of amino groups. Varying the reaction conditions, namely the concentration of arginine, the reaction temperature and the presence of isopropyl alcohol, makes it possible to control the reaction of aminolysis and, consequently, the mechanical and biological properties of modified PCL films. Previously published works have proved the possibility and effectiveness of the proposed method of modification of hydrophobic PCL films. In this study, it was possible not only to expand the understanding of the influence of modification conditions on the properties of cultured cells, but also to study the properties of modified films in more detail. Thus, based on measurements of the mechanical characteristics of films, namely, a decrease in the strength characteristics of modified films at the initial moment of deformation loads, we made the assumption that both surface and bulk degradation of PCL films occurs during such modification. Moreover, the films are already subjected to the degradation process after treatment in clean water for 1 day. A noticeable decrease in yield strength (almost twice) compared to the original unmodified PCL sample was observed in PCL films treated with arginine solution. One of the reasons for such a sharp decrease in yield strength may be the presence of arginine both on the surface and inside the PCL film. As mentioned earlier, the decrease in stress in the samples after modification is a consequence of the volumetric degradation of PCL films, which contributes not only to the surface reaction of aminolysis, but also to the active absorption of arginine into the sample volume. And the presence of arginine molecules in the volume of PCL films leads to difficulty in their movement under stress, and, consequently, to a decrease in the yield strength, which we observe in Figures 2 and 3. A decrease in the wetting angle in all modified films indicates the active formation of hydroxyl and carboxyl groups on the surface of PCL films. Another result indicating the volumetric degradation of PCL films in the process of such modification is their sufficiently high sorption capacity relative to fibronectin. Moreover, a significant amount of sorbed fibronectin is observed on samples modified at room temperature for 1 day. We assume that such results are associated with deeper volumetric degradation of films during 1 day at room temperature, compared with degradation over a shorter time interval, even when heated to 40 \u25e6C. Obviously, this result is related to the autocatalysis described earlier. According to the obtained results, 1 day after seeding, the largest number of cells were observed on PCL films treated with arginine in an aqueous alcohol solution. However, after 3 days of cultivation, the largest number of cells were on films treated in an arginine in an aqueous solution without alcohol. Thus, despite the decrease in a number of mechanical properties of modified films, the ability to adhesion, cell proliferation on such films, as well as the synthesis of extracellular matrix proteins significantly increases. Therefore, such films can be further used for cell cultivation and transplantation.\nPolymers 2022, 14, 4654 14 of 15\nAuthor Contributions: Y.N. and A.C. prepared the polymer samples and realized the biological experiments; O.M. carried out mechanical tests; G.V. carried out water contact angles measurements; I.V. and P.E. carried out determination of synthesized extracellular matrix protein; Y.N., V.Y., A.N. and N.M. planned and designed the experiments and provided the resources for their implementation.
