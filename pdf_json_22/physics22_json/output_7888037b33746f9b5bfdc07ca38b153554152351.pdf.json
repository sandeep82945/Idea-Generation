    "abstractText": "Using analytic results obtained in a meson effective theory, that includes all infrared sensitive logs, we build a dedicated Monte Carlo framework to describe QED corrections in B\u0304 \u2192 K\u0304`+`\u2212 for a generic form factor. For the neutral mode B\u03040 \u2192 K\u03040`+`\u2212, we perform a detailed numerical comparison versus those obtained with the general-purpose photon-shower tool PHOTOS. The comparison indicates a good agreement, at the few permil level, when focusing on the rare mode only. In addition, our framework allows us to investigate the impact of the charmonium resonances. Interference effects, not described by PHOTOS in the experimental analysis, are found to be small in the dilepton invariant mass region q2 < 6GeV2, which is used to determine RK(\u2217) . Using a semi-analytic framework we assess the full, rare and resonant, mode. Based thereupon, we discuss strategies to check the subtraction of the resonant mode, which has a sizeable impact at q2 \u2248 6GeV2 in the electron mode.",

            "text": "Within the Standard Model (SM), the Yukawa coupling is the only interaction that distinguishes the different fermion families. In the lepton sector, all the Yukawa couplings are small compared to the SM gauge couplings, giving rise to an approximate accidental symmetry known as Lepton Flavour Universality (LFU). This symmetry holds to a very good accuracy within the SM, especially for the two lightest families (e and \u00b5), and it can be tested to high accuracy in B meson decays, where the kinematic effects due to light lepton masses are small (see e.g. refs. [1, 2] for a review). Particularly interesting in this respect are the \u00b5/e LFU ratios in flavour changing neutral currents (FCNC) transitions [3], such as\nRK |q20\u2208[q21 ,q22]GeV2 = \u0393 [ B\u0304 \u2192 K\u0304\u00b5+\u00b5\u2212 ] \u0393 [ B\u0304 \u2192 K\u0304e+e\u2212 ] \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 q20\u2208[q21 ,q22]GeV2 , (1.1)\n\u2013 1 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 0 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 4 6\nwhere q20 \u2261 (pB \u2212 pK)2. In the SM, RSMK \u2248 1 up to QED corrections [4, 5]. The current experimental determination is [13\u201315]\nRK |q20\u2208[1.1,6]GeV2 = 0.846 +0.042+0.016 \u22120.039\u22120.012 , (1.2)\nand exhibits a statistically significant deviation from the theory prediction. Similar tensions between data and SM predictions, albeit with smaller statistical significance, have been reported in the analogous quantities RK\u22170 [16], RK\u2217+ and RKS [17]. In this paper, we assess the robustness of the theoretical determination of RK with respect to QED corrections, which provide the dominant source of LFU violation within the SM. While QED corrections are tiny for fully inclusive observables (when differential in collinear-safe variables), they induce non-universal corrections of the type (\u03b1/\u03c0) ln(m`/mB) which can reach the 10% level in the electron mode, when accompanied by tight cuts on the photon energy [4, 5]. These effects are corrected for by the experimental collaborations: the value in eq. (1.2), as well as the results for the LFU ratios reported in [16, 17], correspond to photon-inclusive observables (in the collinear safe differential variable q20, cf. section 2.1.) However, what is really measured are not photon-inclusive observables: tight cuts on reconstructed B mass are employed to reduce, amongst the different background contributions, events originated from resonant modes, e.g. B\u0304 \u2192 K\u0304(J/\u03a8\u2192 `+`\u2212) that leak into the signal region. The photon-inclusive results are obtained by comparing with appropriate Monte Carlo (MC) simulations. The purpose of this paper is to check this procedure using a dedicated MC-framework developed on grounds on our earlier work [5]. The latter consists of a complete differential description of O(\u03b1) QED corrections in B\u0304 \u2192 K\u0304`+`\u2212(\u03b3) based on an effective meson theory. In the experimental analyses, QED corrections are implemented via photon shower algorithms such as PHOTOS [18\u201321], or the PHOTONS++ module [22] of SHERPA [10], where mesons are treated as point-like particles. In [5], using gauge invariance, it was shown that no further lepton non-universal collinear logs (i.e. ln(m`) terms) are generated by structure dependent corrections, i.e. that the point-like approximation for the mesons is a very good approximation, especially when considering LFU ratios. The photon shower algorithms used by the experiments therefore do provide a very good starting point to describe data. In practice, QED corrections in B\u0304 \u2192 K\u0304`+`\u2212(\u03b3) are not treated perfectly due to the resonant mode being simulated separately from the rare mode, therefore neglecting the respective interference. The latter is a potentially dangerous effect due to the migration towards lower q2-values of events with on-shell charmonium resonances and sizeable photonenergy emission: an effect which is particularly pronounced for the electron mode [4, 5]. We note that in the inclusive case these effects have been investigated in the factorisation approximation in [6], whereas we can go beyond since the B\u0304 \u2192 K\u0304\u03a8 branching fractions are known from experiment. This paper consists of two parts. Firstly, the description of our MC-framework based on [5], and its comparison with PHOTOS at the fully differential level, considering the rare mode only (i.e. the short-distance (SD) part of the decay amplitude) is discussed. Second, going beyond the PHOTOS analysis, we assess the impact of the charmonium resonances (or the long-distance (LD) contribution to the decay amplitude), which is particularly\n\u2013 2 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 0 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 4 6\nrelevant in the electron mode [13\u201315]. This second part is addressed in a twofold manner: i) by means of our MC-framework, assessing the impact of the SD-LD interference effects (not included in PHOTOS), focusing on the region q2 \u2208 [1.1, 6]GeV2; ii) by means of a semi-analytic approach, using the splitting function, assessing the complete impact of the resonant modes beyond interference terms (and resumming the leading collinear logs). We limit our analysis to the neutral mode B\u03040 \u2192 K\u03040`+`\u2212. This choice does not limit the validity of our conclusions on SD-LD interference effects due to charmonium resonances, whilst it has an important simplification for the numerical study. In this case, we can analyse in full generality the impact of the hadronic form factor, without resorting to a derivative expansion in the underlying meson effective theory [5]. It is noted that a first comparison of analytical estimates of QED corrections and PHOTOS has been presented in ref. [4]. The present study provides significant improvements compared to [4] on various aspects: i) building a dedicated MC to simulate B\u0304 \u2192 K\u0304`+`\u2212(\u03b3) events, we are able to perform an extensive study of the tool used to interpret data at a fully differential level; ii) our MC is valid for generic photon kinematics, while the analysis of [4] implicitly assumed tight cuts on the photon-angle emission (cf. appendix A.2 [5]); iii) we perform a detailed study of the effects of the resonances, taking into account also the variation of the strong phase between SD and LD contributions.1 The paper is organised as follows. In section 2, we introduce the basic kinematics of the process and the principles of our MC-approach. In the following section 3, we compare kinematic distributions obtained with our MC-simulation with those obtained with PHOTOS. The impact of charmonium resonances is discussed in section 4. Finally, in section 5, we summarise our results and present a brief outlook. Technical details are deferred to appendices A, B to D and supplementary plots are collected in appendix C."

Soft and soft-collinear logs then manifest as ln \u03b4ex and ln \u03b4ex lnm` terms. Single lnm` terms are referred to (hard)-collinear logs throughout; a terminology which differs at times from the ones used in soft-collinear effective theories [7]. As stated in many textbooks, a photon energy cut-off, mrecB or \u03b4ex in our case, is sufficient to define IR-safe observables (for massive charged particles). However, this is not the procedure applied in many of today\u2019s experiments, especially at hadron colliders. In this case the event distributions are fitted in a given window of mrecB > m rec,` B and mrecB becomes a key differential variable. Using the simulated shape in mrecB , by a MC-tool (e.g. PHOTOS), the theoretical non-radiative rate in the IR-safe differential variable q20 is reconstructed.2 Checking the validity of this procedure requires the comparison of the MC-tool used in the data analysis with one based on a QED calculation defined in a full theoretical framework, such as the one presented in [5]. The validation of the procedure ensures that, within the SM, the measured RK is then RK |SMreconstr. = 1 +O(\u03b1\u03c0 ), where \u03b1 = e2/(4\u03c0) \u2248 1/137 is the fine structure constant."

They are interpreted as (non-negative) probability distribution functions (PDFs) with an a priori unknown normalisation. This allows us to generate the MC samples by means of the hit-or-miss algorithm. The concrete sampling procedure, for both 3- and 4-body decays, is outlined as follows:\n1. A single point in phase space, denoted by ~x, is uniformly sampled in the kinematically allowed region of (q2, c`) or (q2, p\u03042B, c`, c\u03b3 , \u03c6\u03b3) for simulated 3- or 4-body events, respectively.\n2. Using the kinematic decomposition reported in appendix A, the sampled variables are translated to the corresponding momenta of the B decay products.

If r > \u0393(~x) (\u201cmiss\u201d) points 1. and 2. are repeated until for one sampled r, r < \u0393(~x) (\u201chit\u201d) and the point ~x is kept.\nThe standard hit-or-miss algorithm can suffer from very low sampling efficiency in the case where the decay width exhibits pronounced peaks since it only accepts a fraction of extractions equal to the ratio of the volume under \u0393(~x) and the volume of the hypercube containing \u0393(~x) itself. This is valid in particular for the 4-body decay width \u03934(~x) which is peaked close to collinear and soft regions. In order to increase the sampling efficiency, the \u201cimportance sampling\u201d technique is employed. This technique consists in dividing the support, over which ~x is sampled, such that in each subinterval, \u0393(~x) has a smaller variation than in the overall range, hence allowing to increase the sampling efficiency by one to two orders of magnitude.\nWe compare our MC-approach against the EvtGen [27] + PHOTOS [18, 19] which are the simulation software packages used by the LHCb collaboration. The former is an event generator specifically designed for B-physics in which the decay amplitudes (models), instead of PDFs, are used for the simulation of heavy meson decays. PHOTOS encodes the QED radiative corrections to such decays and uses a splitting function approach iteratively. In principle, this achieves the inclusion of the leading logs and thus, remaining discrepancies can be expected to be of O(\u03b1\u03c0 ). Since 2005, when multi-photon radiation was introduced [20], there were no further public upgrades of the program until 2010, when PHOTOS was moved to a C++ environment allowing the use of event records such as HepMC [28]. We employ version 3.64 which enables the use of PHOTOS in the case where there are no parent particle(s) or incoming beams generating the decaying particle, which, paired with the EvtGen package, allows us for a direct comparison with our MC simulation. In order to match the EvtGen model with our description of the decay, O(\u03b1s) two-loop virtual corrections [29] to the decay width are switched off from the default EvtGen configuration.\nMoreover, since our MC accounts for QED corrections up to O(\u03b1), for each B decay in which more than a real photon is emitted, only the hardest emission is considered and all the softer emissions\u2019 momenta are summed and saved into one \u201cparticle\u201d for further cross-checks.\n3 Direct comparison with PHOTOS at the short distance level"

The specific form factors are taken from [30] (with set 2), which is a light-cone sum rules computation up to NLO twist-3 and O(\u03b1s), and is also used by the LHCb collaboration.\n3.2 Comparison of our Monte Carlo with PHOTOS\nThe main results of this section consist of the plots in figure 1 and figure 2, for the kinematic variables q20 (2.3) and q2 (2.2), respectively. In each of these figures, the top plots display the impact of the radiative corrections on the q20- and q2-spectra when considering either muons (left) and electrons (right), in our MC. The normalisation per se of the MC-plots is not meaningful as both LO and NLO are separately normalised to 1 when integrated over q20 or q2 (compare with the normalised plots in figure 4 in [5]). This ambiguity can be removed by taking double ratios between our MC-approach and the PHOTOS software as shown in the middle and bottom of these figures for muons and electrons respectively. Let us discuss the q20-variable first. Even though the hard-collinear logs cancel in this variable, the introduction of a photon energy cut-off, via mrecB = (4.88, 5.18)GeV, leads to sizeable QED contributions. The agreement between the two approaches is excellent as shown by the good compatibility of these distributions with unity across the q20-spectrum, for both lepton flavours (bottom plot). The distributions in the q2-variable, shown in figure 2, are more delicate as hard collinear logs do not cancel. In addition, events can migrate in the q2-spectrum due to radiation which will be important when discussing the impact of the resonances. Hence, even without placing a photon-energy cut-off, the corrections are sizeable, cf. figure 4 in [5]. Again, the agreement between the two approaches is excellent, as expected, except for electrons at high q2 where deviations up to O(4%) are found. This originates from large corrections that go beyond the fixed O(\u03b1) accuracy of our MC. In fact, at the kinematic endpoint, the corrections are roughly 20% (cf. figure 8 in [5]) at NLO, indicating the need of NNLO accuracy to reach % level precision, and explaining qualitatively the residual difference with PHOTOS (where the resummation of the leading-log corrections is implemented). Using the splitting function formalism in section 4.3, in its resummed form, we were able to reproduce quantitatively the O(4%)-effect between our MC and PHOTOS (cf. footnote 8). It is worthwhile to elaborate on why the corrections are large at the kinematic endpoint in q2. This happens because, at the endpoint, the leptons carry all the energy and there\n3In the relation of CV (A) and C9(10) we correct a factor minus two w.r.t. the published version of [5] which, however, has no impact on the result of that paper as all results are relative.\n\u2013 7 \u2013\n\u2013 8 \u2013\n\u2013 9 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 0 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 4 6\nis effectively no phase space for the real radiation. As a result, near the endpoint in q2, virtual corrections dominate and the cancellation between real and virtual corrections is maximally out of balance. In other words, requiring large q2 is equivalent to a tight cut on the photon emission energy. In the splitting function approach, this can be seen from the lower boundary of the real emission integral (over the momentum fraction carried by the lepton, z) approaching the upper boundary.\nIn summary, the cross checks we have performed allow us to validate that the approximations adopted by PHOTOS in describing (real and virtual) QED corrections in B\u03040 \u2192 K\u03040`+`\u2212 decays are accurate to sub-percent level. Additional plots displaying comparisons of the impact of radiative corrections on the kinematic variable c` between our MC and PHOTOS can be found in appendix C."

While the main contribution (peak) of the resonances is cut in the experimental analyses, a residual effect from the radiative tail of the resonances is potentially present at hadron colliders, where the q20 variable is not accessible. As previously mentioned, the migration in q2, due to QED radiation, implies that events generated at high q20 (e.g. close to the resonance region) necessarily move down toward low q2-values, possibly affecting the signal region for the rare mode. The migration is controlled by the mrecB cut: only events with\nq2 \u2264 q20 \u2264 ( q20 ) max \u2261 q2 + \u03b4exm2B , (4.1)\nare relevant to determine radiative corrections at a given q2-value.4 The mrecB cuts used to define the signal windows for electron and muon modes in the LHCb analyses are reported in table 1. Note that the cut on the electrons is looser than the one on the muons: a measure implemented to decrease the loss of events in the electron case where radiation effect is stronger. As can easily be checked, in the electron case, events at q2 = 6GeV2 probe (via photon radiation) the non-radiative spectrum above the J/\u03a8-resonance (m2J/\u03a8 \u2248 9.58GeV 2), but do not probe the \u03a8(2S) peak.\n4The value (q20)max is reached for photons emitted backward with respect to ~q in the B RF [5].\n\u2013 10 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 0 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 4 6\nThis effect is well known and the residual contribution of radiation from the J/\u03a8 in the signal region is taken into account in the experimental analyses.

The purpose of this section is to estimate the possible impact of these effects. In section 4.1, we discuss how the amplitude of the rare mode can be adapted to describe SD-LD interference terms. Using this modified parametrisation of the amplitude, in section 4.2, we analyse the numerical impact of the interference terms in our MC-framework.

In turn, this requires to place a cut on q20 \u2264 9.59GeV2 (cf. appendix D for details) since the remaining terms become negative above that threshold, invalidating their interpretation as a PDF (cf. section 2.3). Another factor limiting the sampling efficiency is the lepton mass, which in the electron case has to be increased to 10 times its physical value (cf. appendix D) to allow for efficient sampling.6\nOur approach is well justified since the modulus squared of the J/\u03a8-resonance is well simulated by PHOTOS (see [15]), and the component describing its leakage in the signal region is included in the fit used to extract the rare mode yield. With our simulation, we aim to analyse the effect on the q2 bin migration of the J/\u03a8 interference term, that has so far not been considered in the experimental analyses.\nThe resonance data is given by the normalisation \u03b7J/\u03a8 = 8180 in the notation of (4.5) (or \u03c1J/\u03a8 = 1.38, in the notation of (B.3)), with mass and width in table 2, and the interference phase \u03b4J/\u03a8. For the latter, we choose two representative values: \u03b4J/\u03a8 = (1.47, 0) where the former is deduced by the LHCb analysis of the dilepton spectrum [33], and the latter is a conservative choice aimed at maximising the J/\u03a8 interference effect. The plots in figures 3 and 4 show the effect, as a function of q2, on the radiative corrections when including the J/\u03a8 interference term in the decay width, for interference phases of \u03b4J/\u03a8 = (1.47, 0) respectively. More specifically, they represent the double ratio of NLO over LO differential decay widths including charm over the same ratio without charm.\nBoth figures include electron-like (red) and muon (blue) distributions, with appropriate mrecB = (4.88, 5.18)GeV cuts (cf. table 1). As can be seen from these plots, the impact of the SD-LD interference term is well below the 1%-level in the q2 < 6GeV2 region, for the (realistic) phase choice \u03b4J/\u03a8 = 1.47. Even, in the conservative case \u03b4J/\u03a8 = 0, it remains just below 1%. We thus conclude that when applying the aforementioned cuts, the experimental\n5Refinements include the interference of broad resonances [12] and the inclusion of two-particle thresholds assuming strong constant phases [32].\n6We have checked that the lnm`-behaviour is consistent with what is obtained using the semi-analytic method described in section 4.3.\n\u2013 12 \u2013\napproach of neglecting the interference effect of charmonium resonances, when fitting for the rare mode in the q2 < 6GeV2 region, is well-justified."

Taking the last bin [20.9GeV2, (mB\u2212mK)2], used in figure 2, and weighing by the rate, we produce an effect of \u2248 0.96 which agrees very well with the central value in that figure.\n\u2013 14 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 0 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 4 6\n+ + + + + + + + + - - - - - - - - - \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0+ +charm- -charm\u25a0 no-charm 2 4 6 8 0.90 0.95\n1.00\n1.05\ne,\nd\u0393NLO dq2 d\u0393LO dq2\nmrecB >4.88GeV \u03b4J/\u03a8,\u03a8(2S)=0,\u03c0 cut on |AB\u0304\u2192K\u0304(\u03a8\u2192ee)|2\nq2[GeV2]\n+ + + + + + + + + - - - - - - - - - \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0+ +charm- -charm\u25a0 no-charm 2 4 6 8 0.94 0.96 0.98\n1.00\n1.02\n\u00b5,\nd\u0393NLO dq2 d\u0393LO dq2\nmrecB >5.18GeV \u03b4J/\u03a8,\u03a8(2S)=0,\u03c0 cut on |AB\u0304\u2192K\u0304(\u03a8\u2192\u00b5\u00b5)|2\nq2[GeV2]\nFigure 5. Plots with the resonant mode cut out (cf. main text for explanation). For q2 < 6GeV2 the interference effects are small, even in the electron case (confirming the plot in figure 4), and do not indicate any contamination to RK in particular. The corresponding plot without the LO normalisation can be found in appendix C in figure 8.\nIt is convenient to parameterise the relative QED correction d2\u0393\u221d(1+\u2206(`)(q\u03022, c`))dq\u03022dc`), following our earlier work, as\n\u2206(`)hc ( q\u03022, c` ) = \u03b1 \u03c0\n( 1\n\u0393LO d2\u0393LO\n( q\u03022 )\ndq\u0302dc2`\n)\u22121 ( Q\u03022`1\u2206\u0303 (`) hc,`1 + Q\u0302 2 `2\u2206\u0303 (`) hc,`2 ) , (4.6)\nwhere q\u03022 \u2261 q2/m2B for brevity and the subscript \u201chc\u201d stands for the (hard) collinear contribution.

(4.9)\nThe corresponding expression for \u2206\u0303(`)hc, `2 can be obtained by changing the signs on all the cosines in the lepton angles in eqs. (4.8) and (4.9). We turn to the practical implementation. As compared to the previous section, we include the second resonance \u03a8(2S), cf. table 2 for the basic inputs. In this case \u03b7\u03a8(2S) = 1160 (or \u03c1\u03a8(2S) = 1.56, in the notation of (B.3)) describes its residue up the free phase \u03b4\u03a8(2S). In order to emulate the LHCb procedure in eliminating the J/\u03a8 mode, we cut out the amplitude squared of the resonant mode in the following q20-window:\n\u2013 15 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 0 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 4 6\n+ + + + + +\n+\n- - - - - -\n-\n\u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0+ +charm- -charm\u25a0 no-charm 1 2 3 4 5 6 0.9 1.0\n1.1\n1.2\n1.3\ne,\nd\u0393NLO dq2 d\u0393LO dq2\nmrecB >4.88GeV \u03b4J/\u03a8,\u03a8(2S)=0,\u03c0 with |AB\u0304\u2192K\u0304(\u03a8\u2192ee)|2\nq2[GeV2]\n+ + + + + + + + + - - - - - - - - - \u25a0\n\u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0 \u25a0+ +charm- -charm\u25a0 no-charm 2 4 6 8 0.94 0.96 0.98\n1.00\n1.02\n\u00b5,\nd\u0393NLO dq2 d\u0393LO dq2\nmrecB >5.18GeV \u03b4J/\u03a8,\u03a8(2S)=0,\u03c0 with |AB\u0304\u2192K\u0304(\u03a8\u2192\u00b5\u00b5)|2\nq2[GeV2]\nFigure 6. Same plots as in figure 5 including resonant modes: (left) for electrons and (right) for muons respectively. It is noted that at q2 = 6GeV2, the effect is noticeable for electrons and care has to be taken (cf. main text). For the electrons, the plot ends at q2 = 6GeV2 since beyond this value the effects are too large (at q2 = (7, 8)GeV2 we find, approximately, (6.5, 40) and (8.4, 73) for +charm and -charm respectively). We have checked that resummation slightly tames the effect but qualitatively, it remains the same. The muon plot looks deceptively similar to the one in figure 5 for q2 < 8GeV2 but differences arise thereafter. The corresponding plot without the LO normalisation can be found in appendix C in figure 9.\nm2\u03a8\u2212\u2206\u03c92 < q20 < m2\u03a8 +\u2206\u03c92 with \u2206\u03c92 = 0.1GeV2. Empirically, we find that choosing the undetermined scale to be \u00b52hc \u2248 6q2,does reproduce our short distance results in [5] rather well. It is not surprising that the scale is proportional to q2 since this is the relevant scale \u201cseen\u201d by the lepton pair.\nIn order to assess the possible uncertainty of the charm contribution, we choose the phases to give rise to maximal interference i.e. \u03b4J/\u03a8,\u03a8(2S) = 0 and plot the three graphs: one without any charm, one as described above and one with the sign reversed (i.e. \u03b4J/\u03a8,\u03a8(2S) = \u03c0). The maximal difference can then be seen as a conservative estimate for the error of not including the charm.\nPlots for the electron and the muon cases with the resonances cut out are shown in figure 5. This situation mimics the interference of the rare and resonant mode and it is seen from the plots that, for q2 < 6GeV2, this contribution is small. At q2 = 6GeV2 the difference between the two charm contributions with opposite sign is 2% and when this effect is averaged over the entire [1.1, 6]GeV2 bin it is clear that the effect does not exceed O(1%) which would be comparable to structure dependent corrections. This is fortunate since, as previously mentioned, resonant versus rare-mode interference are not included in the LHCb analysis. These results can be seen as a validation of the double ratio plots in figure 4 obtained in the MC-framework (with meaningful absolute normalisation).\nWe turn to the case where we include the full resonant mode. Crucially, the squared resonant amplitude is independent of the \u03b4J/\u03a8-phase and dominates over the interference. This can be seen from the electron plot shown in figure 6, by comparing it to the corresponding one in figure 5. Furthermore, it can be seen that for the electron cut-off, QED effects begin to be sizeable below the q2 < 6GeV2 and thus care has to be taken. The effect is coming from the J/\u03a8 resonance and the effect of the \u03a8(2S) resonance is moderate for the given electron cut.\n\u2013 16 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 0 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 4 6\nThis is further reflected in the LHCb mass fit projections to the signal mode (cf. figure 2 in [15]) where the leakage of the resonant mode is included in the total fit model, together with the other backgrounds components, to extract the electron signal yield. Amongst the cross-checks performed in the measurement of RK are the integrated and differential ratios rJ/\u03a8, which directly compare electron and muon detection efficiencies, and thus constitute a stringent validation of their analysis. The value of rJ/\u03a8 is known in the SM to be unity to a very high degree of accuracy, since it originates from the tree level mediated resonant mode, and was measured in the RK analysis, rJ/\u03a8 = 0.981\u00b10.020. This result is one sigma compatible the SM prediction and with the previous measurements of this quantity [31]. Moreover, as can be seen from figure 9\u201310 of [15], rJ/\u03a8 is also performed differentially as a function of variables which are used in the determination of the dilepton invariant mass, such as the opening angle of the lepton pair and their transverse momentum. The flatness of rJ/\u03a8 in those variables reflects an excellent description of the efficiency-related effects in muons and electrons. Not only are these crucial cross-checks per se, but they also validate the double ratio method used to minimise the efficiency-related systematic error in the RK measurement [15], and the accuracy in the description of the QED corrections from the absolute square of the J/\u03a8-mode. Despite all these positive cross-checks, since the overall impact of the resonance modes is large (cf. figure 5), it would be of great relevance if the LHCb collaboration could perform a q2-binned analysis of RK . This would provide a further important test of the robustness of RK . Related to that, we have investigated the robustness of the results with respect to non-perturbative aspects which are difficult to control: the extrapolation of the BreitWigner form and neglecting higher resonances. The Breit-Wigner resonance gives a good approximation close to its pole only and its extension away from the pole is not thoroughly known. When using (4.5) an implicit assumption on its form was made; it is dictated by the short distance form factors (cf. appendix B for further comments). We may therefore assess the effect by choosing flat form factors multiplying the Breit-Wigner resonances and adjusting the residue to reproduce the B \u2192 \u03a8e+e\u2212 rate. Specifically, we replace the form factor by its value at the subtraction point. It is found that this effect leads to changes which do not exceed the 2%-level for q2 < 6GeV2 and is thus fortunately moderate. The effect of changing the number of subtractions in (4.4) can be seen as a way to estimate neglecting higher resonances since many of them are needed to reproduce the precise asymptotics of perturbative QCD. However, one versus no subtraction leads to small O(1%) changes only and might be seen as an indication of the consistency of the subtraction value with the resonance data. In summary the extension of the J/\u03a8-resonance has a much larger effect than neglecting higher states. All in all, this underlines the importance of a refined q2-binning from a different viewpoint. Another way to look at it is that it emphasises the importance of knowing the LO amplitude (i.e. the idealised amplitude in the absence of QED) since its precise form affects the detailed form (size and magnitude) of QED corrections. In this respect, given the smaller impact of QED effects and the better experimental resolution, the muon case can serve as a tool for a precise determination of the LO spectrum in a data-driven approach.\n\u2013 17 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 0 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 4 6"

            "text": "In this article, we investigated numerical aspects of QED corrections on the B\u03040 \u2192 K\u03040`+`\u2212 decay, which is of particular relevance in view of LFU tests. We constructed a dedicated Monte Carlo framework based on the computation in [5] (cf. section 2), and further analysed QED effects by means of a semi-analytic (splitting-function based) approach (cf. section 4.3) which captures the numerically dominant collinear logs. In section 3, we compared our Monte Carlo framework with PHOTOS at the level of the short distance matrix element (rare mode) and found good agreement at the differential level in all relevant variables (in particular q2, c` and q20, c0). Particularly relevant is the comparison in the q2-distribution, illustrated in figure 2, which plays a key role in the LFU tests at hadron colliders. Since PHOTOS and our approach are supposed to capture all the leading logs, agreement was to be expected. Indeed, a partial cross-check of PHOTOS, in the q20- and with an effective cut-off in the q2-distribution were already reported in [4]. Our double differential comparison thus provides a solid cross-validation of both our Monte Carlo framework and PHOTOS. In addition to the short distance contribution, our Monte Carlo and semi-analytic framework has allowed us to assess the impact of the resonant mode B\u0304 \u2192 K\u0304(J/\u03a8\u2192 `+`\u2212) on the extraction of RK (in sections 4.2 and 4.3 respectively). Both the Monte Carlo and the semi-analytic approach confirm that the interference effects between resonant and rare mode (not included in PHOTOS) are below 1% for q2 < 6GeV2. This justifies not simulating these effects in the experimental setup, as currently done. On the other hand, the resonant mode, as known and expected, has a significant effect in the electron mode below 6GeV2 as the plot in figure 6 quantifies. This is taken care of in the present experimental analyses. As pointed out, a useful validation of this procedure could be obtained with an extraction of RK in different q2-bins (in the q2 < 6GeV2 region). A further independent cross-check could be obtained varying mrecB (in particular setting a tighter cut on the electron mode). Last but not least, we stress that a precise description of the q2-dependence of the nonradiative amplitude, including short- and long- distance terms, is a key ingredient to obtain the O(\u03b1) corrections at the sub-percent level (cf. remarks at the end of section 4.3). In this paper, we have specifically focused on the case of neutral hadrons, which has facilitated the implementation of an arbitrary q2-dependence in the form factor. As discussed, we expect the conclusions for the charged modes to be qualitatively similar, especially as far as the interference effects between resonant and rare modes are concerned. Moreover, the same outcomes ought to hold for the B\u0304 \u2192 K\u0304\u2217`+`\u2212 and the \u039bb \u2192 \u039b`+`\u2212 modes. A decisive aspect is that the remaining QED corrections, due to structure dependence, which are not incorporated in PHOTOS, have been shown to be free of lnm` enhanced factors (cf. section 3.4 [5]). When going to the structure dependent level, which necessitates the introduction of new gauge invariant interpolating operators [8] and or new gauge invariant distribution amplitudes [11], new sizeable lnmK(\u03c0)-effects can be expected to be present for K(\u03c0) final states. However, they would cancel in LFU ratios [4, 5], along with (other) structure dependent effects, for the reasons mentioned above. Putting all these ingredients together, the present analysis provides an important further validation that the LFU tests so far performed by the LHCb collaboration are robust with respect to LFU violations induced by QED corrections.\n\u2013 18 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 0 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 4 6"

For the latter, we have adapted the notation and results from the inclusive mode b \u2192 s`` [29]. This treatment falls short of effects specific to the structure of the B\u0304- and K\u0304-mesons. The Wilson coefficients C3,6 correspond to the penguin induced four quark operators and can be neglected for our purposes. The C2 \u2248 1 Wilson coefficient arises at tree level and C1 \u2248 \u22120.15 is generated by renormalisation group running (specifically we employ (C1, C2, C9)(mb) = (\u22120.15, 1, 4.035) as reference values).

At last, let us comment on the status of the resonance data, the significance of writing the dispersion relation in \u2206C9 rather than the amplitude and parameterising without reference to the SM.\n\u2022 From the branching fractions, it has been known for a long time that \u03c1J/\u03a8 \u2248 1.38 and \u03c1\u03a8(2S) \u2248 1.56 and that there are sizeable corrections to NF. By fitting the interference of the (broad) charm resonances with the short distance contributions, the corresponding correction factors were found to be even larger and come with\n\u2013 20 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 0 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 4 6\nopposite phase \u03b4\u03a8 \u2248 \u03c0 as compared to NF [12] (cf. plots and tables therein). Later, the LHCb collaboration [33] fitted the phases of the J/\u03a8- and \u03a8(2S)-resonances which are more challenging as they are narrow. Qualitatively, a four fold degeneracy (\u03b4J/\u03a8, \u03b4\u03a8(2S)) \u2248 (\u00b1\u03c02 ,\u00b1 \u03c0 2 ) (cf. table3 in [33]) emerges which indicates a rather small interference effect since the short distance contribution is real.\n\u2022 In principle, one could have directly written a dispersion relation for the full amplitude. However, the amplitude and \u2206C9 essentially differ by the form factor f+(q2) which is an analytic function with a pole and branch points above the physical region. They are thus both legitimate functions for a dispersion relation. Differences comes into play when approximations are made. In our case, they differ on how we extend from the narrow resonance limit, which is not-known from first principles, and thus, a priori, any of the two seems as good as the other. Perhaps, the one for \u2206C9 is preferable as we know that the extension is at least correct in the case of NF, which might be seen as a reasonable qualitative starting point (cf. end of section 4.3 for comments on the actual numerical relevance.)\n\u2022 One may parameterise without reference to NF (cf. eq. (3) in [33])\n1 2\u03c0idisc [\u2206C9] (s) = \u03b7re\ni\u03b4rmr\u0393r\u03b4 ( s\u2212m2r ) , (B.4)\nthereby avoiding reference to the SM. Comparison with (B.2) reveals the relation between the parameters\n\u03b7r \u0393r = \u03c1r 3\u03c0 \u03b12 (C2 + 3C1)\u0393r\u2192`+`\u2212 . (B.5)"

This includes the MC-plots in figures 7 about angular distributions. The fact that QED gives rise to qualitatively different angular distribution (or higher moments) was pointed out in [34] (cf. section 5) and advertised as a way to measure pure QED effects. Auxiliary plots for the semi-analytic approach are shown in figures 8 and 9 which can help to better understand the normalised figures since the normalisation depends on the charm input.\nD Values of f th used in the Monte Carlo simulations\nTable 3 gives the values of \u03933\u0393tree for various cases, which are used to calculate f th, needed for the normalisation of the Monte Carlo. When the resonance is \u201coff\u201d, only the contribution from the rare mode is considered, and the integration for the total rates is performed over the full range of q20. In this case, we consider two possible frames (p\u0304B and q0) for imposing the spurious cut on the photon energy E(i)\u03b3 in order to separate 3- and 4-body events.

Same plots as in figure 6 without LO-normalisation.\nthe soft log (lnE(i)\u03b3 ) is the same for each case, as expected. The results are given for 3 different leptons (\u00b5, 10e and e) for each photon energy cut. The shorthand 10e denotes an \u201cintermediate\u201d lepton which has a mass of m10e = 10me, which is roughly in between the muon and electron mass.\nWhen the resonance is \u201con\u201d, the contribution from the interference of the rare mode with the Breit-Wigner term of the J/\u03c8 is included, but not the square of the Breit-Wigner term itself. In this case, we consider two possible values for the phase of the J/\u03c8: \u03b4J/\u03c8 = 0 (maximum interference) and \u03b4J/\u03c8 = 1.47 (LHCb value from [33]). The corresponding restrictions on the range of the q20 integration are q20 \u2264 9.5905GeV2 and q20 \u2264 9.585GeV2 respectively. This is done in order to capture the maximum effect from the interference term in each case. Only results for photon energy cuts in the q0-RF are given, since in the p\u0304B-RF, the MC has extremely low efficiency. This is because for a photon energy cut-off in the p\u0304B-RF, the sampling for the MC also has to be performed in p\u0304B. Then, applying a cut in q20 (which is now a function of several sampling variables) becomes problematic, and significantly decreases the sampling efficiency. Furthermore, having an electron mass also significantly decreases the efficiency of the Monte Carlo, so we restrict ourselves to a muon mass m\u00b5 and an \u201cintermediate\u201d mass m10e(= 10me) when interference effects are considered.\n\u2013 23 \u2013\nJ H E P 1 0 ( 2 0 2 2 ) 1 4 6\nResonance Frame for E(i)\u03b3 ,cut Lepton \u03933\u0393tree\nOff\np\u0304B\n\u00b5 1 + \u03b1\u03c0 ( 5.1479 + 10.924 lnE(p\u0304B)\u03b3 ,cut ) 10e 1 + \u03b1\u03c0 ( 7.8551 + 23.012 lnE(p\u0304B)\u03b3 ,cut\n) e 1 + \u03b1\u03c0 ( 9.9605 + 32.222 lnE(p\u0304B)\u03b3 ,cut )\nq0\n\u00b5 1 + \u03b1\u03c0 ( 6.8903 + 10.924 lnE(q0)\u03b3 ,cut ) 10e 1 + \u03b1\u03c0 ( 12.473 + 23.012 lnE(q0)\u03b3 ,cut\n) e 1 + \u03b1\u03c0 ( 16.772 + 32.222 lnE(q0)\u03b3 ,cut\n) On, \u03b4J/\u03c8 = 0 q0 \u00b5 1 + \u03b1\u03c0 ( 8.7111 + 10.140 lnE(q0)\u03b3 ,cut\n) 10e 1 + \u03b1\u03c0 ( 16.658 + 22.223 lnE(q0)\u03b3 ,cut\n) On, \u03b4J/\u03c8 = 1.47 q0 \u00b5 1 + \u03b1\u03c0 ( 9.6159 + 9.5767 lnE(q0)\u03b3 ,cut\n) 10e 1 + \u03b1\u03c0 ( 19.271 + 21.647 lnE(q0)\u03b3 ,cut\n)\nTable 3. f th for different cases. When the resonance is \u201con\u201d, the interference of the Breit-Wigner term of the J/\u03c8 and the rare mode is included (but not the square of the Breit-Wigner term). 10e is a \u2018fake\u2019 lepton that has an \u2018intermediate\u2019 mass (between the muon and the electron), and we take m10e = 10me. When the resonance is \u201coff\u201d (ie. only rare mode), the full range of q20 is integrated over. When \u03b4J/\u03c8 = 0, the q20 integration is restricted in the region q20 \u2264 9.5905GeV2, whereas when \u03b4J/\u03c8 = 1.47, the q20 integration is restricted in the region q20 \u2264 9.585GeV2.
