    "abstractText": "Sol-gel graphene oxide-coated polyester fabric platforms were synthesized and used for the on-line sequential injection fabric disk sorptive extraction (SI-FDSE) of toxic (i.e., Cd(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II)) metals in different distilled spirit drinks prior to their determination by electrothermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS). The main parameters that could potentially influence the extraction efficiency of the automatic on-line column preconcentration system were optimized and the SI-FDSE-ETAAS method was validated. Under optimum conditions, enhancement factors of 38, 120 and 85 were achieved for Cd(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II), respectively. Method precision (in terms of relative standard deviation) was lower than 2.9% for all analytes. The limits of detection for Cd(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II) were 1.9, 7.1 and 17.3 ng L\u22121, respectively. As a proof of concept, the proposed protocol was employed for the monitoring of Cd(II), Cu(II), and Pb(II) in distilled spirit drinks of",

            "text": "A wide variety of metals and metalloids have been detected in alcoholic beverages, (e.g., As, Cd, Cr, Co, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni, Sn, Pb, and Zn), the presence of which can be attributed to the raw materials used for their production; to the substances added during brewing; and to the equipment used during the storage, bottling, distillation and aging process [1,2]. Although elements such as Cu are essential for living organisms, long-term exposure to high concentrations can lead to chronic toxicosis [2]. On the other hand, metals such as Cd and Pb are considered to be highly toxic even at low concentration levels and they are associated with neurological disorders, anemia, kidney damage, liver damage and gastrointestinal damage [3,4]. Besides the impact of metals in human health, their presence in alcoholic beverages can significantly influence the quality of the product [1]. Depending on the type of the alcoholic beverage, a very wide range of metal concentration can be observed. Cd concentration can range from not detected up to 5.31 mg L\u22121, Pb concentration can range from not detected up to 1.125 mg L\u22121 and Cu concentration can range from not detected up to 14.6 mg L\u22121 [1]. Undoubtedly, electro-thermal atomic absorption spectrometry (ETAAS) is a powerful analytical spectrometric technique for metal determination due to its excellent applicability, high sensitivity, reduced operational cost and method simplicity [5\u20137]. However, due to the low concentration of the trace elements in the distilled spirit samples, a preconcentration step is necessary for the sensitive and accurate metal determination in complex samples. Currently, a lot of attention is being paid to the development of on-line automated sample\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2103. https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules28052103 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2103 2 of 15\npreparation systems as an alternative to batch-mode extraction procedures. According to the principles of green sample preparation that were recently introduced [8], the development of automatic sample preparation procedures can contribute to a reduction in the required amount of chemicals and waste generated while providing a larger sample throughput. At the same time, automation can also assist in the minimization of the operator\u2019s exposure to hazardous chemicals, thus reducing the risk of accidents. Although there are various on-line approaches for the extraction and preconcentration of metals, most of them focused on environmental and biological samples, and on-line systems for the monitoring of the metal content of alcoholic beverages are limited [9,10]. Fabric phase sorptive extraction (FPSE) is an evolutionary sample preparation technique that utilizes sol-gel organic\u2013inorganic sorbent-coated fabric substrates with high thermal, chemical and solvent stability as extraction platforms [11]. A plethora of sol-gel coatings can be easily prepared, resulting in the fabrication of neutral, anion and cation exchangers, zwitterionic, and mixed mode zwitterionic sorptive phases [12]. FPSE has proved to be a significant sample preparation technique for the determination of a wide variety of organic and inorganic chemical species at trace- and ultra-trace-level concentrations [11,13]. Recently, the on-line flow injection\u2013fabric disk sorptive extraction (FI-FDSE) technique was proposed as an automatic alternative to FPSE [14]. This technique offers various benefits such as high extraction efficiency, good reproducibility and sensitivity, and sorbent reusability [14,15]. Sol-gel sorbents have proved to be an important tool in environmental analysis [16], food analysis [17] and bioanalysis [18]. The second generation of flow injection techniques, known as sequential injection analysis (SIA), is based on the usage of programmable, bi-directional discontinuous flow, which is precisely coordinated and controlled by a computer. Due to its inherent characteristics, SIA exhibits multiple benefits including low chemical consumption, versatility, manifold simplicity, low operational cost, and low waste generation [19\u201321]. Although the FI-FDSE technique is a powerful analytical technique for on-line metal determination [14,15], its operation in on-line sequential injection (SI) mode has not yet been reported. In this work, novel sol-gel graphene oxide-coated polyester FDSE membranes were synthesized and used to prepare a reusable and renewable on-line fabric disk sorbent extraction microcolumn. Graphene oxide has been proved to be a powerful material for the extraction of metals [22,23]. The proposed platform was employed for the first time for the effective preconcentration and determination of Cd(II), Cu(II) and Pb(II) as model analytes in distilled spirit drinks as a front end to ETAAS. The optimization of the main factors of the FDSE procedure was conducted to ensure the high extraction efficiency of the target analytes. The herein-developed protocol was validated and used for analysis of real samples."

Optimization of the On-Line Column Preconcentration Procedure The main hydrodynamic and chemical factors of the SI-FDSE procedure were optimized by means of the one-variable-at-a-time approach (OVAT).

Method optimization was performed using aqueous standard solutions of 0.05 \u03bcg L\u22121 Cd(II), 0.15 \u03bcg L\u22121 Cu(II) and 0.5 \u03bcg L\u22121 Pb(II) at 0.01 mol L\u22121 HNO3.\n2.2.1. Effect of Chelating Agent and Sample Acidity In this work, ammonium pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (APDC) was used as chelating agent due to its well-known ability to form strong hydrophobic complexes in acidic solutions. Different concentrations (i.e., 0.01\u20130.5% m/v) of APDC solution were investigated to provide sufficient metal complexation and reduced chemical consumption. It was observed that an increase in the concentration up to 0.05% m/v had a positive effect, while any further increase in the concentration did not result in any additional benefits. However, since other potentially co-existing metals can consume the chelating reagent for metal complex formation, APDC was used in an excess concentration of 0.1% m/v. The effect of sample acidity has been thoroughly investigated in earlier studies and it is evident that a stable metal complexation is observed using a nitric acid concentration of 1.0 \u00d7 10\u22123\u20131.0 \u00d7 10\u22122 mol L\u22121 that corresponds to sample pH values of 2\u20133 [14].

This parameter plays a crucial role for the efficient on-line formation and retention of the analyteAPDC complexes onto the surface of the sol-gel sorbent. In this case, a concentration of HNO3 of 0.01 mol L\u22121 was chosen to ensure the sufficient complexation.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2103 4 of 15\n2.2.2. Effect of Loading Flow Rate and Preconcentration Time\nThe sample loading flow rate and the preconcentration time in automatic time-based systems are considered to be two critical parameters since they determine the sample volume, the analyte retention and the preconcentration time. In addition, they affect the velocity of the liquid inside the column and, thus, the contact time between the target analyte and the active groups of the sorbent which is crucial for their interaction. These parameters are directly associated with the sorption equilibration and retention of the metals on the sorptive phase of the FDSE medium [24]. The sample loading flow rate was investigated between 60 \u00b5L s\u22121 and 180 \u00b5L s\u22121 for a preconcentration time of 60 s, maintaining a sample/APDC flow rate ratio of ca. 15. As shown in Figure S4, an almost linear increase in method sensitivity was reported up to 150 \u00b5L s\u22121, demonstrating the efficient retention of the in situ-created metal complexes. At higher flow rates, a slight decrease in the response was observed. As a result, different loading flow rates can be employed in the on-line SI-FDSE procedure depending on the required sensitivity, the required sample throughput, and the sample availability. In this case, a sample loading flow rate of 150 \u00b5L s\u22121 was considered satisfactory for high method sensitivity, and it was finally adopted for further studies. Subsequently, the preconcentration time was studied between 15 and 100 s. As it is presented in Figure S5, the increase in the absorbance for all analytes was practically proportional to the increase in preconcentration time. As a compromise between method high sensitivity and high sample throughput, a preconcentration time of 90 s was finally chosen.\n2.2.3. Effect of Eluent Type and Elution Flow Rate\nIn this study, MIBK was chosen as an eluent. This solvent has been proven to be a powerful eluent compared to organic solvents with lower polarity due to the limited dispersion of the eluted analyte and the efficient desorption of the retained complexes from the sorbent [25]. The elution flow rate of MIBK within the SI-FDSE system was investigated between 5 and 20 \u00b5L s\u22121. No significant response variations were observed within the examined range. Thus, an elution flow rate of 10 \u00b5L s\u22121 was chosen to ensure sufficient interaction between the adsorbed analytes and the MIBK.\n2.2.4. Effect of Sample Volume Injected in Graphite Furnace\nIn order to achieve good method sensitivity, the effect of different sample volumes injected in the ETAAS system were studied. This parameter determines the amount of analyte that is finally analyzed. In this study, the first portion of the eluent zone was injected in the ETAAS system, since it is expected to contain the desorbed analytes at higher concentration in comparison with other parts along the zone of the eluent. For this purpose, different quantities between 25 and 45 \u00b5L were studied. Sufficient method sensitivity was obtained using 35 \u00b5L of eluent and, thus, this value was finally chosen.\n2.2.5. Effect of Sample Ethanol Content\nThe effect of ethanol concentration on the absorbance was studied between 5% and 40% v/v ethanol in water. As shown in Figure 2, absorbance for all analytes was constant at ethanol contents varying between 5 and 20% v/v, while a slight decrease was observed at higher ethanol content. This observation is in accordance with other studies about alcoholic spirit drinks, in which sample dilution is recommended since high ethanol contents reduce the retention of the target analytes due to the disruption of the interaction between them and the active groups of the sorptive phase [26,27]. Thus, to ensure the efficient retention of the metal, the distilled spirit drinks should be at least 1:1 (v/v) diluted with water prior to SI-FDSE procedure.\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2103 5 of 15\nMolecules 2023, 28, 2103 5 of 17\nefficient retention of the metal, the distilled spirit drinks should be at least 1:1 (v/v) diluted with water prior to SI-FDSE procedure.\nFigure 2.
