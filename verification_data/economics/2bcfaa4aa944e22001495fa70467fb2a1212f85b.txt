"In this paper, we studied the network of cities formed through multinational companies and their subsidiaries for 2010 and 2019. We used topological overlap as a metric to identify stable and changing cities in this network. The stable cities identified in this paper further strengthen previous studies on the importance of cities like New York, London, Paris, and Tokyo[20,25]. Stable cities are home to many multinational firms, which contribute to the economic stability of these cities. Analyzing the list of changing cities, it is clear that most of them are in the US or China. Changing cities in China are not concentrated in a single region implying decentralization strategy for economic growth. Most of these cities are port cities, indicating a higher focus on international trade for economic growth. On the other hand, US cities showed more intent towards domestic trade as these cities are densely connected within the country, and only a few of them are port cities. Coincidentally, all cities identified in the changing cities indicated growth."
