            "text": "Ultraviolet (UV) all-solid-state lasers are widely used in optical communication and laser processing, in which UV nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals as an essential component play an indispensable role in extending the wavelength.1\u20133 In the past several decades, the continuous pursuit of high-performance UV NLO crystals has promoted the development of many explorative systems, such as borates (uorooxoborates),4\u20139 carbonates,10,11 phosphates (monouorophosphates),12\u201315 sulfates,16,17 and so on. To date, however, although a lot of UV NLO crystals have been reported, the progress of their commercialization has been retarded, mainly due to either the difficulty of crystal growth or some performance pitfalls.

For ESI or other electronic format see\n997\nNLO crystals with excellent comprehensive performance and easy growth is signicant and challenging.\nCurrently, fundamental building blocks (FBBs) for constructing UV NLO crystals can be classied into two main categories, p-conjugated planar groups and non-p-conjugated tetrahedral groups. Among them, p-conjugated planar groups are widely recognized as ideal FBBs for UV NLO crystals because they possess large microscopic second-order susceptibility and strong optical anisotropy, which are benecial for achieving remarkable SHG efficiency and large birefringence (Dn). Particularly, p-conjugated planar B\u2013O groups, such as (BO3)\n3 units in KBe2BO3F2 (KBBF) and Sr2Be2B2O7 (SBBO),18 and (B3O6)\n3 units in b-BaB2O4 (BBO),4 play dominant roles in building superior UV NLO materials. In recent years, inspired by these classical functional modules, some organic p-conjugated planar groups have been successfully developed, such as [C(NH2)]3\n+ units in C(NH2)3SO3F19 similar to (BO3) 3 units, and (C3N3O3) 3 units in KLi(HC3N3O3)$2H2O (KLHCY)20 similar to (B3O6) 3 units. However, when these rigid p-conjugated planar triangle or planar six-membered ring groups are employed in constructing UV NLO crystals with strong SHG responses, there will be a generally ignored issue, namely, accompanying overlarge birefringence (Dn > 0.11 at 1064 nm) due to the alignment of pconjugated planar groups. For UV NLO crystals, overlarge birefringence tends to cause the spatial walk-off effect that affects the frequency doubling efficiency, which limits the practical\n\u00a9 2022 The Author(s).

The famous example is the commercial BBO crystal, which has a strong SHG efficiency of more than 5 times that of KH2PO4 (KDP) but suffers from an overlarge birefringence (0.113@ 1064 nm) hindering its high-power output. To our knowledge, thus far, there has been no study on designing UV NLO crystals with a balance between a strong SHG response and moderate birefringence (0.07 < Dn < 0.11).\nIn 2019, Pan et al. employed a exible p-conjugated (B2O5)\nfunctional module for designing birefringent crystals. They adopted reasonable cation collocation to make the exible (B2O5)\nfunctional module completely coplanar, which results in a large birefringence of 0.095 @ 532 nm in Li2Na2B2O5.21 Inspired by this work, we proposed that exible p-conjugated groups should be employed for the performance modulation in NLO crystals because the delocalized p electrons within the group are favourable for the enhancement of the SHG response on one hand, and on the other hand the exible rotation of the groups is benecial for modulating the birefringence, consequently which may achieve a balance between a strong SHG response and moderate birefringence of UV NLO materials. Guided by this idea, we screened out malonic acid as a functional module because it has a similar geometric conguration to exible (B2O5)\ngroups. In addition to malonic acid, alkalimetal cations were considered as counter ions to crystals for the following reasons. Firstly, the introduction of alkali-metals with strong ionicity is conducive to expanding the band gap. Secondly, the reasonable combination of low coordinated and highly coordinated alkali-metal cations can adjust the arrangement of exible p-conjugated groups, thus modulating the birefringence, which has been conrmed by Pan et al.21\u201324\nBased on the above considerations, a systematic exploration of mixed alkali-metal (including both low-coordinated Li+ cations and highly coordinated cations (Na+, K+, Rb+, and Cs+)) malonates results in nding a non-centrosymmetrical (NCS) compound KLi(C3H2O4)$H2O (KLMW). As expected, beneting from the modulation of exible p-conjugated (C3H2O4) 2 groups, KLMW achieves a balance between a large SHG response (3 KDP) and suitable birefringence (0.103 @ 1064 nm). Notably, such a birefringence is very suitable and the smallest among those of recently reported organic\u2013inorganic hybrid UV NLO crystals. In addition, centimeter-level KLMW single crystals can be grown conveniently by an aqueous solution method (Fig. S1\u2020). More importantly, the fourth harmonic generation of Nd:YAG laser radiation (1064 nm) with type-I phase-matching was realized in KLMW."

For these four compounds, alkali metal Li atoms have two different coordination numbers (CNs) of 4 and 5, and alkali metal K atoms have the same CN of 7. Notably, for LM, L2M and KM, it can be seen that the lower the CN of Li is, the more positive the rotation of the dihedral angle b of (C3H2O4) 2 is (b(LM) \u00bc 9.433, b(L2M) \u00bc 48.494 and b(KLMW) \u00bc 73.737 ) (Fig. 4). This suggests that the four-coordinated Li atoms may have the potential to regulate the exibility of (C3H2O4) 2 groups. In addition, for the selected three compounds, there is only a single alkali metal Li or K atom, which further combined with malonate groups forming the centrosymmetric structures. Compared with them, the combination of the four-coordinated Li atoms and seven-coordinated K atoms in KLMW drives the formation of the NCS structure. According to previous studies, the combination of low-coordinated and high-coordinated cations is benecial to optimizing the arrangement of anionic groups and producing excellent NLO properties, such as the KBBF family,7,37\u201339 AB2O5 (A \u00bc Li4, Na4, Li2Na2),21 LiBa3Bi6(SeO3)7F11 and Ba3Bi6.5(SeO3)7F10.5O0.5.40 Therefore, it can be expected that KLMW will have superior linear and nonlinear optical properties."

Also, the UV cut-off edge of KLMW is 231 nm, which is shorter than those of the most reported organic\u2013inorganic hybrid UV crystals including KLi(HC3N3O3)$2H2O (237 nm),20 RbNa(HC3N3O3)$H2O (241 nm),41 (C5H6ON) +(H2PO4) (264 nm),42 (H7C3N6)(H6C3N6)ZnCl3 (236 nm)43 and Ba3(C3N3O3)2 (241 nm).44\nIn addition to the short UV cut-off edge, to achieve a UV coherent light output, the key is to realize phase-matching conditions, which depend on the appropriate birefringence and chromatic dispersion.

In order to demonstrate the modulation of birefringence by exible pconjugated malonate groups, a series of alkali metal malonates containing different geometrical congurations of malonate groups is investigated. Furthermore, their birefringence was calculated by the rst-principles theory (Fig. S6\u2020). It is well\nFig. 4 Comparisons of rotation angles, dihedral angles, and birefringen (LM), (c) Li2(C3H2O4) (L2M), (d) Na(C3H3O4) (NM), (e) KLi(C3H2O4)$H2O (N2MW).\n6994 | Chem. Sci., 2022, 13, 6990\u20136997\nknown that, for an isolated group, the closer the geometrical conguration is to being planar, the larger the optical anisotropy is. Therefore, the rigid planar p-conjugated groups, such as (BO3) 3 and (B3O6) 3 groups, have considerable optical anisotropies. If these rigid p-conjugated groups further have a coplanar arrangement in the crystal, overlarge birefringence is inevitable, such as in BBO. With regard to the malonate groups, since they are exible, their geometrical congurations are determined by the rotation angle a and dihedral angle b, by which their optical anisotropies can be modulated. The rotation angles (a) of the malonate groups are in-plane and similar (110.552\u2013119.331 ) in these examples, and will not cause great effects on their optical anisotropies. Therefore, it can be deduced that the optical anisotropy of the malonate group should be determined by its dihedral angle b. In principle, the larger the dihedral angle b (<90 ) is, the smaller the optical anisotropy of the malonate group is. It is noteworthy that, in addition to the intrinsic optical anisotropies of malonate groups, their arrangement will affect the birefringence. Herein, for the convenience of discussion, the arrangement of malonate groups is not being considered in these cases, which results in slightly irregular variation trends of birefringence from Na(C3H3O4) to KLMW and from Rb2(CH3O4)2(C3H4O4) to Na2(C3H2O4)$3H2O. Even so, as shown in Fig. 4, with the increase of b from 8.816 to 86.277 , the birefringence of the crystals gradually decreased as a whole from 0.155 to 0.034 @ 1064 nm, which is basically consistent with the above deduction. In addition, it can be seen that the overlarge angle b leads to small birefringence in Rb2(CH3O4)2(C3H4O4) and Na2(C3H2O4)$3H2O, which indicates that the suitable angle b is key to obtaining moderate birefringence. Therefore, rationally regulating the exible p-conjugated groups will be an effective approach to obtain NLO crystals with suitable birefringence."

The results reveal that KLMW can realize phase-matching in the visible and UV regions, which supports the above-mentioned phase matching calculations of KLMW. Meanwhile, the SHG efficiency of KLMW is about 3.0 times that of KDP at 1064 nm and 0.5 times that of BBO at 532 nm (Fig. 5). Such a strong SHG response is larger than those of most of the recently reported organic\u2013inorganic hybrid UV NLO crystals (Table 1) and can be comparable with those of some well-known UV NLO materials, including NH4B4O6F ( 3 KDP),8 M2B10O14F6 (M \u00bc Ca, Sr) (2.5, 2.3 KDP),9 ABCO3F (A \u00bc K, Rb; B \u00bc Mg, Ca, Sr) (3\u20133.6 KDP),10,56 LBO (2.2 KDP)5 and CLBO (2.4 KDP).52 According to the anionic group theory, the SHG response of KLMW is dominated by the exible p-groups. Although the (C3H2O4)\n2 groups are non-coplanar in order to achieve moderate birefringence, the microscopic second order polarizabilities produced by the (C3H2O4)\n2 groups are superimposed along the c-axis (Fig. S7\u2020), which makes a major contribution to the SHG response. Therefore, owing to the rational arrangement of (C3H2O4) 2 groups, KLMW achieves\nFig. 6 Scheme of the 266 nm SHG experiment. (a) The principle of crystal plate processing. (b) Crystal plate model.

In the experiment (Fig. 6d), a blue laser spot on the UV-sensitive paper was observed (Fig. 6e), indicating that the 266 nm SHG process was successfully realized. This result further supports the phase-matching ability of KLMW."

            "text": "To gain further insight into the mechanism behind the optical properties of KLMW, its electronic structures were calculated by DFT methods. The band structure of KLMW based on the GGA method is shown in Fig. S8,\u2020 where the calculated band gap (5.08 eV) is slightly underestimated compared with the experimental one (5.32 eV). The total and partial densities of states (PDOSs) are shown in Fig. 7a. It is clear that the uppermost part of the valence band (VB; 7.5 to 0 eV) is essentially occupied by O 2p orbitals with an appreciable contribution of the C 2p orbital, while the bottom of the conduction band (CB) is also occupied by O 2p and C 2p orbitals. It is well known that the optical properties are essentially inuenced by electronic transitions in the states around the Fermi level. Thus, it can be seen that (C3H2O4)\n2 groups should make a major contribution to the linear and nonlinear optical properties of the title compound.\nThe calculated refractive index curves of the title compound are plotted in Fig. S9,\u2020 which shows that the birefringence of KLMW is 0.108 @ 1064 nm, which is in accordance with the experimental value. In addition, the theoretical values of NLO coefficients were investigated. Under the consideration of the point group of mm2, KLMW has three nonzero independent NLO coefficients d31, d32 and d33. The calculated results showed that they are 0.441, 1.597 and 1.914 pm V 1 at 1064 nm, respectively (Fig. S10\u2020). Among them, the largest NLO coefficient d33 is 4.9 times that of KDP, which is slightly larger than the experimental one. Furthermore, in order to reveal the SHG origin of KLMW, the SHG-weighted density of the largest tensor d33 was calculated (Fig. 7b). Obviously, the nonbonding 2p orbitals of O atoms in (C3H2O4)\n2 groups make major contributions to the SHG response of KLMW.\nChem.

KLi(C3H2O4)$ H2O has excellent optical nonlinearity including a short UV cutoff edge (231 nm), strong SHG response (3 KDP) and moderate birefringence (0.103@ 1064 nm). In addition, its bulk crystals can be easily grown via simple solution evaporation. Preliminary laser experiments indicated that KLi(C3H2O4)$H2O is suitable for fourth harmonic generation of the Nd:YAG laser output. Importantly, our study showed that it is a feasible way to employ exible functional modules to design UV NLOmaterials with a balance between a strong SHG response and moderate birefringence, which will guide the design of new UV NLO materials.\nData availability\nCrystal data, structure renement, atomic coordinates, isotropic displacement coefficients, bond lengths and angles, and additional tables/gures can be found in the ESI.\u2020\nAuthor contributions\nL.
