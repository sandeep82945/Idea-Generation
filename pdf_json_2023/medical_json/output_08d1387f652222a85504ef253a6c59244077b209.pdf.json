    "abstractText": "In the social and behavioral sciences, it is common for event-history data to have a multilevel structure, such that individuals (e.g., students) in a lower-level are clustered into some higher-level context (e.g., schools). However, little work has explored the common situation that such data are not purely clustered, as in the situation where some students may have attended more than one school during the course of a study. In those cases, the use of a cross-classified discrete-time survival model may be needed to appropriately account for individual mobility across clusters. The purpose of this research was to understand the impact of ignoring a crossclassified data structure due to individual mobility across clusters in a discrete-time survival analysis and to examine how the baseline hazard function, variability of the cluster random effect, mobility rate, and withinand between-cluster sample size impact the performance of a cross-classified discrete-time survival model. A Monte Carlo simulation study was used to specifically examine the performance of a discrete-time survival model, a multilevel discretetime survival model, and a cross-classified discrete-time survival model. Simulation factors included the value of the between-clusters variance, cluster size, within-cluster size, Weibull scale parameter, and mobility rate. The generating parameters for the simulation study were based on a review of the applied literature. The results indicated that substantial relative parameter bias and unacceptable coverage of the 95% confidence intervals is possible for all model parameters when a discrete-time survival model is used that does not account for either clustering or individual mobility across clusters, and to a lesser extent, when using a multilevel discrete-time survival model that does not account for mobility. Across nearly all simulation conditions and for all parameters, use of the cross-classified discrete-time survival model resulted in little to no relative parameter bias and acceptable coverage of the 95% confidence intervals. These findings will be useful for methodologists and practitioners in educational research, public health, and other social sciences where discrete-time survival analysis is a common methodological technique for the analysis of event-history data.

CAPPELLI\nUnder the Direction of Dr. Audrey Leroux\nABSTRACT\nIn the social and behavioral sciences, it is common for event-history data to have a\nmultilevel structure, such that individuals (e.g., students) in a lower-level are clustered into some higher-level context (e.g., schools). However, little work has explored the common situation that such data are not purely clustered, as in the situation where some students may have attended more than one school during the course of a study. In those cases, the use of a cross-classified discrete-time survival model may be needed to appropriately account for individual mobility across clusters. The purpose of this research was to understand the impact of ignoring a crossclassified data structure due to individual mobility across clusters in a discrete-time survival analysis and to examine how the baseline hazard function, variability of the cluster random effect, mobility rate, and within- and between-cluster sample size impact the performance of a\ncross-classified discrete-time survival model. A Monte Carlo simulation study was used to specifically examine the performance of a discrete-time survival model, a multilevel discretetime survival model, and a cross-classified discrete-time survival model. Simulation factors included the value of the between-clusters variance, cluster size, within-cluster size, Weibull scale parameter, and mobility rate. The generating parameters for the simulation study were based on a review of the applied literature. The results indicated that substantial relative parameter bias and unacceptable coverage of the 95% confidence intervals is possible for all model parameters when a discrete-time survival model is used that does not account for either clustering or individual mobility across clusters, and to a lesser extent, when using a multilevel discrete-time survival model that does not account for mobility. Across nearly all simulation conditions and for all parameters, use of the cross-classified discrete-time survival model resulted in little to no relative parameter bias and acceptable coverage of the 95% confidence intervals.

While I took coursework, she took care to introduce me to many potential areas for my dissertation research, she invited me to work with her on multiple manuscripts and academic presentations, and coached me through the long process of writing a dissertation that I can be proud of. Her feedback, coaching, and academic prowess have all contributed to my success, and I am grateful for the time I have spent learning from her. Thank you also to my committee members, who all contributed in a unique way to my journey. Thank you to Dr. Katherine Masyn, whose careful review, questions, and comments in all things survival analysis helped to make this dissertation methodologically sound. Thank you to Dr. Hongli Li, who as my assigned advisor when I entered this program, coached me through the potential directions I might take with my interests and skills, and guided me through the first couple of years in this program. And to Dr. Chris Oshima for masterfully introducing me to quantitative methods when I began my doctoral studies as Georgia State.\nI owe another huge debt of gratitude to Dr. Meltem Alemdar, who not only served as a\ncommittee member, but also as my mentor and supervisor at Georgia Tech. I began working with Dr. Alemdar in 2011 in my first job out of graduate school, and her guidance has directed my professional life in ways I can\u2019t begin to describe. Without her mentorship, I would not have even begun a PhD program, but she convinced me that I was capable and provided me with support throughout the entire process. Her continuous encouragement, positive thoughts, and unrelenting support helped me to complete my journey through this program.\niii\nTABLE OF CONTENTS\nLIST OF TABLES ........................................................................................................................

            "text": "In many fields within the social and behavioral sciences, it is common for researchers to\nask questions regarding the timing of an event occurrence. For example, educational researchers may be interested in if and when student dropout occurs, and the factors that influence the timing and occurrence of dropout. Epidemiologists may be interested in the factors that contribute to the timing and occurrence of the first asthma attack among urban youth, or in the timing and occurrence of some environmental exposure following a natural disaster. In these types of research, it is often the case that data are collected during measurement occasions separated by specified periods of time, and therefore, data on an event is typically measured such that the researcher only knows that an event did or did not occur during the period of time defined by a gap between measurement occasions. Such data collection methods result in discrete-time data, also referred to as grouped-time data, and are typically analyzed using discrete-time survival analysis. While discrete-time survival methods were statistically formulated decades ago and extensively described by Allison (1982), it was not until Singer and Willett (1993) provided a tutorial on discrete-time survival analysis for applied researchers that use of the method became commonplace in the applied literature.\nHowever, the discrete-time survival analysis described by Singer and Willett (1993) may\nnot be appropriate in situations where the data are clustered, such that individuals are nested into some larger contextual space. For example, students can be nested into classrooms, patients can be nested in nurses, and individuals can be nested in clinics. In such cases, when lower-level units are clustered into some higher-level context, the lower-level units may no longer be\n2\nassumed to be independent of their associated clusters; instead, their contextual space is likely to create an environment in which, for example, students clustered into the same school are more alike to each other than students clustered into a different school. The use of a conventional discrete-time survival analysis in the presence of clustered data structures leads to a violation of the assumption of independence of observations (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002). Additionally, traditional discrete-time survival analysis carries an assumption of no unobserved heterogeneity, which is violated if it is known that individuals are clustered into higher-level units, and that the individuals in one cluster are more alike than individuals in another cluster. Such violations result in biased estimates of the baseline risk for event occurrence, and therefore, misplaced inferences (Barber et al., 2000). Therefore, an important extension of conventional discrete-time survival analysis is multilevel discrete-time survival analysis, adding a random effect to the model and accounting for the unobserved heterogeneity present due to clustering.\nMultilevel discrete-time survival analysis represents an important contribution to survival\nanalysis, combining the benefits of using discrete-time survival methods to understand eventhistory data within the multilevel modeling framework. In recent decades, such models are proving more common in the applied literature. For example, in educational research, Ma and Willms (1999) present one of the earliest empirical studies that integrate multilevel modeling techniques with discrete-time survival analysis, accounting for the clustering of students within schools to explore the factors that contribute to the timing and occurrence of student drop-out from advanced mathematics. Davoudzadeh et al. (2015) used a multilevel discrete-time survival analysis to examine the hazard of grade retention among students in kindergarten through eighth grade within the context of school-readiness predictors at both the student and school levels. Multilevel discrete-time survival analysis is also common in other behavioral science disciplines,\n3\nsuch as sociology (e.g., Henry et al., 2004), social network analysis (e.g., de Nooy, 2011), and public health (e.g., Reardon et al., 2002). These studies represent just a small sample of the use of multilevel discrete-time survival methods in the applied literature, but illustrate the extensive use of this modeling approach throughout the social and behavioral sciences.\nWhile each of these studies accounted for clustered data structures, they also assumed\nthat the lower-level units were purely clustered into some higher-level unit. For example, students are members of one and only one school throughout the duration of study, or patients are members of one and only one hospital during the course of their treatment. However, in the social and behavioral sciences, applied researchers may not encounter such simple multilevel data structures. Instead, data often contain complexities that mirror the real world and result in an impure nesting of lower-level units into higher-level clusters. For example, in the case of educational research, student mobility has been shown to be quite common in the U.S., where about 12%-38.5% of students switched schools or moved between 2005 and 2010 (e.g., Ihrke & Faber, 2012; U.S. Government Accounting Office, 2010). This mobility of individuals across clusters can also be found in other social and behavioral science disciplines, such as public health, psychology, or criminology. For example, individual mobility may result in individuals who are residents of more than one city, patients who visit more than one hospital, or prisoners who are held in more than one jail. In datasets that contain mobility, the data structure can be said to be cross-classified. Alternatively, data containing mobility can also be thought of as a special case of a cross-classified data structure, termed a multiple membership data structure. In cases where cross-classified or multiple membership data structures exist, conventional multilevel modeling approaches are inappropriate. Indeed, the methodological literature is increasingly demonstrating the adverse effects of incorrect model specification in the presence of\n4\nsuch complex data structures, and has shown that incorrectly modeling this complexity has a negative impact on parameter estimates (e.g., Cappelli et al., 2020; Luo & Kwok, 2009; Luo & Kwok, 2012; Leroux & Beretvas, 2018b; Leroux et al., 2020; Meyers & Beretvas, 2006). Therefore, in the conventional multilevel modeling framework, cross-classified random effects models (CCREMs) and multiple membership random effects models (MMREMs) have been developed to appropriately model hierarchical complexity."

            "text": "As complex data structures are common across the social and behavioral sciences,\nmethodological research that aims to examine the efficacy of the CCREM or the MMREM for appropriately modeling complex data structures has increased. Most commonly, methodological research using the CCREM or the MMREM has focused on their use for modeling continuous outcomes, such as academic achievement scores. However, some work has also examined the performance of the CCREM and MMREM with binary outcome data, and to a lesser extent, event-history outcome data.\nPrevious simulation studies that examine the performance of CCREMs and MMREMs\nwith continuous outcomes have indicated that ignoring the mobility of individuals across clustering units negatively impacts parameter estimates, especially in regards to estimates of the coefficients for the cluster-level (e.g., school) covariates and their standard errors, as well as cluster-level variance component estimates (Cappelli et al., 2020; Chung & Beretvas, 2012; Leroux & Beretvas, 2018b; Leroux et al., 2020; Luo & Kwok, 2009, 2012; Meyers & Beretvas, 2006; Wolff Smith & Beretvas, 2014a, 2017). Vassallo et al., (2017) and Ren (2011) specifically examined the use of a CCREM with a binary outcome. Vassallo et al. (2017) only examined the intercept parameter and variance components, and similar to findings in the continuous-outcome\n5\nliterature, found that the fixed effect representing the intercept is unaffected by sample size, while higher sample sizes are necessary to estimate variance components without bias. Ren (2011) compared a Hierarchical Generalized Linear Model (HGLM) to a CCREM with a binary outcome, and similar to the continuous-outcome literature, found that inappropriately modeling a cross-classified data structure results in biased parameter estimates, especially for the clusterlevel covariates, their standard errors, and estimates of the variance components. Methodological work in the measurement literature with complex multilevel data structures and longitudinal item response data has resulted in similar findings, indicating that misspecifying the model such that mobility is not correctly modeled does not greatly affect the fixed effect estimates, but does result in bias of the cluster-level variance component estimates (Choi & Wilson, 2016). While there has been little methodological work that has expanded upon these findings for eventhistory outcome data, work by Cafri and Fan (2018) and Elghafghuf et al. (2014) has suggested that continuous-time survival models that account for complex nesting perform better than models that ignore such structures. Only one methodological study has investigated the use of a discrete-time survival analysis in the presence of individual mobility across clusters. Lamote et al. (2013) applied both a cross-classified and a multiple membership discrete-time survival model to data with impure clustering due to student mobility. The authors found that the crossclassified discrete-time survival model and the multiple membership discrete-time survival model resulted in different parameter estimates, both in terms of the fixed effects and variance components, than the models that ignored or deleted mobile students from the dataset; however, they also found that the cross-classified discrete-time model better fit the data than all alternative models.\n6\nGiven the wealth of research that suggests that using an ad hoc approach to ignore\nmobility across clusters negatively impacts model estimates, it is important that researchers are able to correctly model mobility in discrete-time survival models. Therefore, this dissertation aimed to address the following research questions: (1) What is the impact of ignoring a crossclassified data structure due to individual mobility in a discrete-time survival analysis and (2) How does the baseline hazard function, variability of the cluster random effect, mobility rate, and within- and between-cluster sample size impact the performance of a cross-classified discrete-time survival model?"

            "text": "To address these research questions, this dissertation used a simulation study. The\nsimulation study manipulated five conditions that may be encountered by applied researchers, including the within-cluster sample size, cluster sample size, variance at the cluster-level, Weibull scale parameter, and overall mobility rate. The simulation study used the parameter estimates obtained from the previous empirical and methodological literature to inform the generating parameter values. Relative parameter bias, root mean square error, and coverage of the 95% confidence intervals were used to evaluate the estimation of model parameters under the various manipulated conditions for a conditional single-level discrete-time survival model, a conditional purely clustered multilevel discrete-time survival model, and a conditional crossclassified discrete-time survival model.\nThis study provides an important contribution to the literature for the social and\nbehavioral sciences. Multilevel discrete-time survival models are increasingly found in the literature, but only one prior study has accounted for impure nesting in discrete-time survival analysis, and no previous work has been conducted to explore how a discrete-time survival\n7\nmodel performs in such circumstances. Therefore, this study was necessary to understand the effects of ignoring data that contains clustering and/or mobility for empirical researchers conducting a discrete-time survival analysis.\n8\nCHAPTER 2\nREVIEW OF THE LITERATURE\nIn this chapter, survival analysis is presented. The discussion specifically focuses on the\nuse of discrete-time survival analysis, with an emphasis on multilevel discrete-time survival analysis. Additionally, complex multilevel data structures are described and a review of the literature is presented for both cross-classified and multiple membership random effects modeling. Subsequent sections examine the confluence of these complex data structures and survival data, concluding with a presentation of cross-classified discrete-time survival modeling."

            "text": "In the social and behavioral sciences, researchers are often interested in knowing if an\nevent occurs, and if so, when the event occurs. For example, educational researchers may be interested in the dynamics of teacher retention, such as the timing and occurrence of teachers leaving their profession, and the factors that contribute to the risk of leaving. In the behavioral sciences, a researcher may be interested in the timing and occurrence of the first drink of an alcoholic beverage in adolescence. In criminology, researchers might be interested in the hazard of recidivism among previously jailed individuals. In each of these examples, the research interest centers on whether and when events occur, as well as the factors that influence the timing of an event occurrence (Singer & Willett, 2003). Survival analysis refers to the general set of techniques that are used to model the timing of an event occurrence.\nSurvival analysis, also known as event history analysis or hazard analysis, was developed\nin response to an ongoing interest in studying life-history, specifically in understanding the factors that contribute to the occurrence and timing of mortality (Masyn, 2014). Traditionally, researchers utilized conventional logistic regression techniques to model event occurrence, but\n9\nsuch models do not provide information regarding the timing of events. Furthermore, two methodological challenges arise when modeling event history using traditional logistic regression methods. First, event data are typically replete with missing data (Masyn, 2014; Singer & Willett, 2003). In studies of event history, missing data occurs for a number of reasons, some of which are typical of longitudinal studies, such as participant drop-out or loss to followup. More specific to event history data, some participants simply may not experience the event during the study. A number of ad hoc approaches have historically been used to resolve missing data challenges, for example, by restricting data collection to include only those participants who have experienced the event, retrospectively removing participants from the dataset who have not experienced the event, imputing unknown event times (e.g., assigning \u201cevent\u201d to all participants at the end of the study), or dichotomizing the outcome such that the event either occurred or did not occur by a specific point in time (Allison, 1982; Singer & Willett, 1993, 2003). However, such ad hoc strategies result in a loss of important information, a distortion of event times, and ultimately, substantial biases and misplaced inferences (Allison, 1982). The second methodological challenge is that researchers may often be interested in the use of time-varying covariates, or covariates that change during each measurement occasion, to explain the timing and occurrence of the event under study (Allison, 1982). Traditional linear regression techniques are not able to handle explanatory variables that change during the course of a study, and therefore, create unrealistic restrictions for model specification.\nGiven these methodological challenges, statisticians developed modeling techniques that\nare better able to model event history data. Continuous-time survival analysis was developed to alleviate these challenges, where it is assumed that the timing of an event is known exactly and can occur at any point in time. In the development of continuous-time survival methods,\n10\nnumerous approaches for parameter estimation were developed that impose strict assumptions often untenable in applied research (Masyn, 2003). In his seminal paper, Cox (1972) alleviated such issues by proposing a model that utilizes a partial likelihood estimation method, where the covariates in the model are estimated without placing strict distributional restrictions on the part of the model that estimates the probability of event occurrence when all predictors equal zero, otherwise referred to as the part of the model that estimates the baseline hazard (Allison, 1982). Cox\u2019s model has been transformative in event history analysis, and has readily been extended to accommodate single and repeated event histories, time-varying covariates, and also nonproportionality, broadening the modeling potential for survival data (Allison, 1982; Singer & Willett, 2003).\nWhile influential, Cox\u2019s model treats time as continuous, which is often not appropriate\nfor research in the social and behavioral sciences. A continuous-time model is useful for situations in which the event occurrence is measured precisely, such that few individuals will have the same event time (Allison, 1982). In contrast, in the social and behavioral sciences, longitudinal data are typically collected at measurement occasions separated by specified periods of time, and therefore, data on an event is typically measured such that the researcher only knows that an event did or did not occur during the period of time defined by a gap between measurement occasions. For example, a behavioral scientist examining the timing and occurrence of substance abuse relapse might collect data at the end of each month, on March 31 and April 31. Some participants might relapse on April 2, while others relapse on April 30, but the researcher will only know that relapse occurred sometime between March 31 and April 31 when data are collected on the April 31 measurement occasion. In other words, although study participants may experience the event at many different times, the event history data are recorded\n11\nsuch that the event occurs for all participants at a single point in time, which here is recorded as April 31. The result is that many participants in the study are documented as experiencing the event at the same time, which is referred to as an overlapping event time or tied event histories. Such data, where a large proportion of individuals in the population are recorded as having experienced the event at the same time, is referred to as discrete-time data. As continuous-time survival methods assume that event occurrence happens at a unique, precise point in time that differs for each individual, the use of such methods for discrete-time data are incorrect (Ducrocq, 1999). As such, discrete-time survival analysis is often preferred in the social and behavioral sciences due to an inability to document precise event timing.\nThe following sections describe discrete-time survival analysis in the context of the social\nand behavioral sciences. The methodological features of the models are presented, followed by a description of a common data format used to conduct a discrete-time survival analysis and the parameterization of the model. The chapter then discusses the extension of survival analysis to the multilevel modeling framework, including situations that assume pure clustering of data, as well as more complex nesting of individuals within clusters."

            "text": "While longitudinal studies can accommodate numerous types of outcome variables, the\ninterest in studies of event history are specifically in event occurrence outcome data. There are three common methodological features necessary for any survival analysis, including the identification of a target event, the beginning of time, and a scale for time (Masyn, 2009; Singer & Willett, 2003). In order to conduct a survival analysis, an event occurrence must be identified that clearly defines the transition of an individual from one state of being to another (Singer & Willett, 2003). For example, non-smoker to smoker or high school attendee to high school drop-\n12\nout. Those who are at risk of experiencing the identified event during each time period are termed the risk set (Masyn, 2009). Second, the beginning of time must be identified, or the time that all individuals in the population under study become eligible to experience the event (Singer & Willett, 2003). For example, in a study of teacher retention, the beginning of employment might represent the beginning of time for a cohort of teachers, because they cannot leave teaching before the point at which they were employed as teachers. Lastly, there must be a clear measure for how time is recorded, which can consist of either actual event times or measured event times (Masyn, 2009). In some studies, time is recorded continuously, such that the researcher knows the precise moment in time that the event occurred. In other studies, the event time may be recorded discretely, such that it is only known that the event occurred between measurement occasions. For example, it is common in studies of student grade retention that time is recorded by school year because it is only known that a student is held back following the end of the school year.\nThere are three types of discrete-time survival data, which occur either by study design or\ndue to the nature of the event of interest (Safarkhani & Moerbeek, 2013). First, some events may be of a continuous-time nature but are recorded in discrete time. For example, in their study of risk for early initiation of sex among American Indian youths, Mitchell et al. (2007) discretized an event, sexual initiation, that has an underlying continuous nature. In other words, sexual initiation can occur at any precise point in time, but for the purposes of this study, was discretized. The authors argued that the timing of sexual initiation is typically measured in a much more discrete metric, generally by age in years as opposed to the precise moment of the event, and therefore, a discrete-time model was more appropriate for the data. Second, some events can only occur at discrete intervals of time. For example, Davoudzadeh et al. (2015) used\n13\na multilevel discrete-time survival analysis to examine when grade retention was most likely, as well as whether school readiness predictors influenced grade retention at the child- and schoollevels. Grade retention typically only occurs once per academic year, and therefore, the event itself is of a discrete-time nature. Lastly, in some cases, data collection methods may require that the researcher provide participants with large periods of time to indicate event occurrence. This is especially true in retrospective studies where research subjects are asked to recall the timing of an event that happened in the past (Safarkhani & Moerbeek, 2013). For example, it is unlikely that a participant will be able to recall the exact day that they stopped smoking if they are asked about their smoking history at a later point in time. In such cases, the researcher may choose to ask participants to select a range of time that coincides with when they stopped smoking, such as 1-2 years ago, 3-4 years ago, etc. In each of these cases, even when the underlying nature of the event may be continuous, the event is recorded in discrete intervals. Therefore, this necessitates the use of discrete-time survival analysis."

            "text": "As previously described, one of the primary challenges of survival data, like any\nlongitudinal study, is related to the amount of missing data. In survival jargon, missing data are most broadly referred to as \u201ccensored\u201d data, and refers to any individual in the sample with an unknown event time (Singer & Willett, 2003). Censored data can be either noninformative or informative and is most commonly distinguished as being either left- or right-censored (Singer & Willett, 2003).\nThe distinction between noninformative and informative censoring is of vital importance\nin survival analyses, as this distinction has critical implications for the validity of the inferences made from the analysis. Noninformative censoring describes the situation in which the censored\n14\ndata are independent of both the risk of event occurrence and actual event occurrence (Allison, 1982; Singer & Willett, 1993, 2003). Censoring that occurs due to the study design, where event occurrence is missing simply because data collection has ended at the conclusion of the study and the event of interest did not occur for a portion of the sample population is clearly noninformative censoring. However, noninformative censoring can also occur when there is a loss to follow-up due to reasons unrelated to the study. When censoring is noninformative, it corresponds most closely to the missing at random (MAR) assumption (Masyn, 2009). In studies of event-history, this means that given the measured covariates and the participant\u2019s responses during past measurement occasions, the chance that the participant misses the current assessment does not depend on the timing of the first occurrence of the event (Bacik et al., 1998). In contrast, censoring can also be informative. Informative censoring occurs when individuals are lost to follow-up, but have experienced the event or are likely to experience the event in the future (Singer & Willett, 2003). In such cases, the censored event is related to the study interest, so the non-censored individuals are systematically different from censored individuals, which can lead to false inferences. Therefore, all survival models assume that censoring is noninformative, as any informative censoring will produce biased parameter estimates (Singer & Willett, 2003).\nAdditionally, censoring can be categorized by how it occurs in the data, most commonly\nreferred to as left- or right-censoring. In left-censoring, the event time is unknown because it occurred prior to the study period (Singer & Willett, 2003). If the beginning of time is incorrectly defined for a study of event-history, then some members of the population will have experienced the event before the study commenced. In other words, the study participants experienced the event sometime between the true beginning of time and the start of data collection, and the event\n15\ntime is therefore left-censored. In contrast, right censoring occurs when the event time is unknown because the event occurrence is not observed and occurs sometime after the final known observation point (Masyn, 2014; Singer & Willett, 2003). In the case of right-censoring, the event time is missing either by study design (i.e., the study ended prior to the event occurrence) or by loss to follow-up. As previously explained, it is vitally important that rightcensored event times are noninformative, as informative censoring will lead to biased inferences."

            "heading": "Person-Period Data Format",
            "text": "As with any statistical model, the first step in model building is to properly format the\ndata. For many discrete-time survival analyses, the data are formatted in the person-period format. The person-period format is analogous to \u201clong-format\u201d data used for growth curve modeling in the multilevel modeling framework, where data are entered such that each row represents a different measurement occasion and therefore, each individual in the dataset will have multiple rows of data. For example, in a survival analysis, if the risk set consists of three individuals who are each measured on five occasions for which they are considered \u201cat risk,\u201d there will be 15 rows of data in total. In other words, for each of the three individuals, there are five rows of data representing each measurement occasion for which they remain at risk. This is in contrast to \u201cwide\u201d format data, which is most typically seen in cross-sectional studies or modeling within the structural equation modeling framework, where each individual is on a single row, such that all information related to that individual is spread across multiple columns.\nAn important distinction of the person-period dataset used for survival analysis from\nother statistical modeling approaches that use long-format data is that the number of rows for each individual is determined by their status as being \u201cat risk\u201d for the event to occur. In singleevent discrete-time survival analysis, this means that an individuals\u2019 data are conditional on\n16\nwhether or not they have experienced the event. If an individual has experienced the event, that person is no longer at risk for the event, and therefore will not have any further rows of data for ensuing measurement occasions, or discrete time periods. Table 1 provides an example of data in the person-period format, where the column \u201cTime\u201d represents the discrete time period, t, and event, eti, represents whether an individual, i, in the risk set has experienced the event (eti = 1) or has not experienced the event (eti = 0) during time period, t (Singer & Willett, 2003). In the example provided here, the study took place over five discrete time periods. The columns D1ti through D5ti represent dummy variables for time, which are coded as 1 for the time period it represents and 0 otherwise. For example, in Table 1, data were collected on Individual 100 during each of the five discrete time periods, t, of study. Event occurrence for Individual 100 is coded as 0 for all time periods, indicating that this individual did not experience the event during any time period, and is therefore right-censored. This is in contrast to Persons 110 and 120, who each experienced the event during the study in time periods 2 and 3, respectively. Therefore, they have no data following event occurrence. In other words, once the individuals experienced the event, data were no longer collected because they were not considered at risk for the event in future time periods, and therefore, their data were limited to the number of rows equal to the number of periods that it took for them to experience the event.\nImportantly, the person-period dataset provides information about an individual\u2019s event\nprocesses even if the exact event times are unknown, as is represented by Individual 130 (Masyn, 2009). By including these right-censored individuals in the dataset, their information can still be included in the model. This represents an important advantage in discrete-time survival modeling as opposed to using other modeling approaches, where data for right-censored individuals are excluded from the model, resulting in biased estimates and incorrect inferences (Allison, 1982).\n17"

            "heading": "The Hazard and Survival Probabilities",
            "text": "discrete-time survival analysis, as they describe the patterns of event occurrence among the population. Using notation from Singer and Willet (2003), the hazard probability (\u210e'() can be expressed as:\n\u210e'( = Pr[*( = + | *( \u2265 +], (1)\nwhere *( represents the time period, +, when individual i experiences the event (eti = 1). For example, when an individual experiences the event in time period 2, *( = 2. Therefore, Equation 1 represents the hazard probability, which as a conditional probability states that an individual, i, will experience the event in time period t, given that the individual did not experience the event\n18\nin any previous time period. As this probability contains information regarding the timing of event occurrence for all individuals, including those who are right-censored, it is the primary quantity of interest in survival analysis (Masyn, 2014; Singer & Willett, 2003). The set of hazard probabilities, one for each time period, is known as the hazard function (Masyn, 2014).\nUnlike the hazard probability, the survival probability does not provide information\nregarding the unique risk of event occurrence in each time period. Rather, the survival probability is cumulative, and represents the proportion of the population that has not experienced the event by a given time period (Singer & Willett, 2003). In other words, it implies that an individual remains event free, or survives beyond a time period, such that the time period that an event occurs for an individual, *(, is greater than time period +. Therefore, the survival probability, /'(, is the probability that an individual, i, will remain event free beyond a time period, t, and is given by,\n/'( = Pr[*( > +]. (2)\nAs a set, one for each discrete-time period, the survival probabilities are known as the survival function. Prior to estimating a discrete-time survival model, it is often useful to plot the sample hazard probabilities and survival probabilities to descriptively examine the data, as represented by Figure 1 (Singer & Willett, 2003). Plotting the hazard probabilities provides the researcher with useful information, including the ability to identify periods of high risk for event occurrence and providing information regarding the pattern of risk over time (Singer & Willett, 2003). For example, in Figure 1, it is apparent that subjects are at especially high risk for event occurrence during discrete time period 1 as compared to periods during the rest of the study. Additionally, it appears that the risk of event occurrence, overall, decreases with time.\n19\nfunctions are related (Singer & Willett, 2003). The survival function is inversely related to the hazard function, such that as hazard increases, survival decreases. In other words, if a large proportion of the risk set experiences the event in a given discrete time period, the rate of survival will decrease sharply during that time period. Conversely, if the risk of event occurrence in a given discrete time period is low such that a small number of individuals experience the event, the survivor function will decrease less rapidly. When no events occur in a time period, the survival function remains level during that time. As opposed to the hazard function, the survival function is a cumulative representation of remaining event free. Therefore, it can never increase during the course of a study; rather, it will always remain stable or decrease (Singer & Willett, 2003). Figure 1 illustrates the relationship between the hazard function and the survival function. Note, for example, that between Periods 1 and 2, as the hazard probability decreases significantly from .3 to .1, the survival function has only a slight decrease, reflecting the high survival rates among the population when hazard is low. In contrast, there is a large increase in hazard between Periods 2 and 3. During the same time periods, the survival function decreases rapidly, reflecting the low survival among the population when hazard is high. As the study\n20\nproceeds, the survival probabilities continually get lower as more individuals experience the event.\nNote that the hazard probabilities provide useful information regarding the unique risk of\nevent occurrence during each discrete time period among those remaining in the risk set; therefore, it provides a summary of both the timing and occurrence of events (Masyn, 2009)."

            "text": "In discrete-time survival analysis, a researcher is interested in the if and when of event\noccurrence. As the outcome can only take on one of two values, eti = 0 or 1, it has a binomial distribution. Therefore, the outcome can be considered to represent n trials of 1 and is a special case of the binomial distribution called the Bernoulli distribution. Given that the hazard probabilities, as represented by Equation 1, correspond to the probability of event occurrence for each time period, which are an observed binary outcome, the discrete-time survival model is easily specified as a conventional logistic regression (Masyn, 2014). As such, an unconditional discrete-time survival model can be formulated for 5 total time periods as:\nlog 4 )!\"\n!*)!\" 5 = 6!71'( + 6\"72'( + 6#73'( + 6$74'( + 6%75'(, (3)\nwhere log 4 )!\"\n!*)!\" 5 is the log of the odds (i.e., logit) of the hazard probability for individual i in\ntime period t, and 71'( through 75'( are dummy variables for individual i in time period t that are coded as one for the time period it represents and 0 otherwise. 6! through 6% are the estimated coefficients for the log hazard odds at each discrete-time period, otherwise known as the intercepts, which as a set represent the estimated logit hazard function.\nNote that the hazard is preceded by a link function, here the logit link, which is a\ntransformation of the expected outcome and links the predictors to the outcome. Although the logit link provides useful transformations of the outcome and predictor variables and is the most\n21\ncommonly used link function in the social and behavioral sciences, the variables are most meaningfully interpreted in the form of probabilities or odds ratios (Masyn, 2003; Singer & Willett, 2003). Given that the interest in discrete-time survival analysis is the estimated hazard probabilities for each discrete-time period, once the model parameters are estimated in the logit scale, Equation 3 can be transformed for interpretation as the hazard probability using the following:\n\u210e>'( = !\n!+ -#$%&'('!\")%&*(*!\")%&+(+!\")%&,(,!\")%&-(-!\". . (4)\nA discrete-time survival model can also be specified with the inclusion of covariates,\nwhich can be either time-varying or time-invariant. A conditional discrete-time survival model with one time-invariant predictor, ?(, at the individual level, such as gender, can be formulated as:\nlog 4 )!\"\n!*)!\" 5 = [6!71'( + 6\"72'( + 6#73'( + 6$74'( + 6%75'(] + @!?(, (5)\nwhere 6! through 6% are the intercept coefficients for their respective time periods and represent the estimated log hazard odds of event occurrence when the predictor is equal to zero. The brackets, [ ], serve to separate the intercept parameters from the predictors entered into the model. The brackets contain the intercept parameters, which as a set represent the baseline hazard function (i.e., the value of logit hazard when the predictor is equal to 0), whereas the parameters on the right that are not inside brackets represent the predictors. Additionally, the covariate\u2019s effect on the likelihood of event occurrence is often described in terms of the hazard odds ratio (Petras et al., 2011), which represents the ratio of the odds of event occurrence for two groups. The fitted odds ratio is found by antilogging the coefficient for the predictor, ?(, such that,\nA/+BCD+EF GFF/ HD+BG = E./'. (6)\n22\nTherefore, the coefficient @! represents the log hazard odds ratio (log hOR) of event occurrence per one-unit difference in its predictor, ?(.\nGiven that the discrete-time survival model is specified as a generalized linear model,\nthey employ many of the same assumptions. For example, the model carries the linearity additivity assumption, which states that the effect of a predictor does not depend on the value of another predictor in the model and that the effect is linear. Importantly, the model also carries the assumption of no unobserved heterogeneity, which states that there is no underlying variability in individuals\u2019 baseline risk for an event that is not measured by the covariates in the model. In other words, the variation in the hazard profiles across individuals in the population is modeled as depending only on the observed variation in the covariates entered into the model (Singer & Willett, 1993, 2003). Lastly, note that in Equation 5, the covariate ?( is modeled such that its effect on the estimate of the logit hazard remains constant in each time period. This implies a common assumption in survival analysis, known as the proportionality assumption. In other words, the model is a proportional model because the change in the logit hazard per unit change in the covariate is assumed to be identical in each discrete time period. However, given that any covariate, time-variant and time-invariant alike, can result in time-varying effects, it may be necessary to specify a model that relaxes this assumption (Singer & Willett, 2003). To do so, Equation 5 can be reformulated such that,\nlog 4 )!\"\n!*)!\" 5 = [6!71'( + 6\"72'( + 6#73'( + 6$74'( + 6%75'(]\n+@!?(71'( + @\"?(72'( + @#?(73'( + @$?(74'( + @%?(75'(, (7)\nwhere the terms @!?( from Equation 5 is replaced with the terms @!?(71'( through @%?(75'(, allowing for a different change in the logit of the hazard probability in each discrete-time period due to the covariate, ?(. Given that the predictor is no longer assumed to result in the same\n23\nchange in the intercept at each period, Equation 7 relaxes the proportionality assumption, and is a nonproportional model.\nAs is typical of a conventional logistic regression, the discrete-time survival models\npresented so far additionally assume that observations, or individuals, are independent of each other. However, it is more likely that individuals who are in the same contextual space are more alike to each other, or behave in a similar way, than individuals who are in different contextual spaces; therefore, it is necessary to account for such clustering using a multilevel model."

            "text": "Multilevel discrete-time survival (ML-DTS) models have become common in the applied\nsocial and behavioral sciences literature. For example, in educational research, it may be necessary to use a multilevel discrete-time survival analysis (ML-DTSA) to account for the clustering of students into schools when the research interest is in the timing of an event occurrence (for applied examples, Anderson, Howland, & McCoach, 2015; Davoudzadeh et al., 2015; Ma & Willms, 1999; Petras et al., 2011). ML-DTS models are also common in other behavioral science disciplines, such as sociology (e.g., Henry et al., 2003), social network analysis (e.g., de Nooy, 2011), and public health (e.g., Reardon et al., 2002). Just as the discretetime survival models presented in Equations 3 and 5 are specified as a logistic regression model, a ML-DTSA can be estimated in the hierarchical generalized linear modeling (HGLM) framework. Therefore, across each of these applied studies, the use of a traditional discrete-time survival model that ignores clustering, as presented in Equations 3 and 5, can lead to a violation of the assumption of independence of observations and result in biased estimates of the standard errors, likely resulting in more frequent Type I errors and therefore misplaced inferences (Moerbeek, 2004; Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002; Steele, 2008; Steenbergen & Jones, 2002).\n24\nHowever, an important difference between a traditional multilevel model and a ML-DTS\nmodel is the additional assumption of no unobserved heterogeneity implicit in a conventional discrete-time survival analysis (DTSA). Importantly, one source of unobserved heterogeneity in DTSA may result from the clustering of data. For example, in the structural equation modeling framework, some methodological studies have specified an outcome of a discrete-time survival model as a latent continuous variable, and with the addition of a random effect, have examined the effects of ignoring unobserved heterogeneity in model estimates (e.g., Baker & Melino, 2000; Kang et al., 2015; Nicoletti & Rondinelli, 2006). In each of these studies, results suggest that ignoring unobserved heterogeneity by excluding a random effect from the model results in biased estimates of the hazard function. Masyn (2003), Muth\u00e9n and Masyn (2005), and Moerbeek (2014) have similarly explored this issue using discrete-time survival mixture modeling, using latent classes to account for unobserved heterogeneity in DTSA.\nOther studies have examined clustering beyond the individual level, where individuals\nare clustered into some other higher-level context. For example, if it is known that students are clustered into schools, unobserved heterogeneity may be introduced because it is likely that the students in one school are more alike to each other than they are to students in another school. Given the introduction of unobserved heterogeneity due to clustering, the consequences of ignoring a level of nesting differ in a DTSA as compared to a conventional logistic regression. Specifically, while ignoring a level of nesting will likely result in an underestimation of the standard errors, it is also expected that bias will be introduced into the point estimates of the fixed effects that represent the hazard function in a DTSA. In other words, the baseline logit hazard probability estimated using a traditional discrete-time survival model will represent the average logit hazard of students calculated over all schools without accounting for between-\n25\nschool differences, and is likely to result in an underestimation of the baseline hazard probability (Barber et al., 2000; Steele, 2003; Vaupel et al., 1979). Therefore, an important extension of a single-level discrete-time survival model is a ML-DTS model, adding a random effect to the clustering-level and controlling for one likely source of unobserved heterogeneity present due to the nested data structure.\nA conventional ML-DTS model assumes purely clustered data. For data to be considered\npurely clustered, all lower-level units must be clustered within a single higher-level unit (Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002). The following sections present unconditional and conditional multilevel discrete-time survival models, and are followed by extensions of this model when presented with more complex data structures."

(2000) developed and demonstrated the use of a discrete-time multilevel hazard model, extending previous work by demonstrating how software programs capable of using maximum-likelihood estimation for HGLMs can be used to conduct a multilevel discrete-time survival analysis that incorporates time-varying covariates for two-level models. Steele (2003) extended single-level discrete time survival mixture models to clustered data by specifying a multilevel discrete-time mixture model. As opposed to previously presented multilevel discrete-time hazard models, the integration of a multilevel discrete-time survival model with mixture modeling allows for the effects of an unobserved variable at the clustering level on the probability of event occurrence at the lower-level and on the timing of eventoccurrence for the at-risk population during each discrete time period. Stemming from the models proposed in this work, the methodological literature concerning discrete-time survival modeling was subsequently extended to further assess the use of such models.\nMoerbeek (2012) explored the performance of a model that incorporates a random effect\nat the cluster level, conducting a simulation within the context of a cluster randomized trial where families were nested within caseworkers. Here, the random effect in the ML-DTSA was placed at the clustering level to account for variability in hazard due to the clustering of families within caseworkers. The simulation varied four factors, including the number of clusters (30, 50, and 100), the within cluster sample size (5, 30, and 50), variance at the cluster level (0.25, 0.5, and 1), and survival pattern (increasing, decreasing, and constant). For all patterns, survival in\nthe control group at the end of the study was 50%. The coefficient for the cluster-level predictor, here representing a treatment effect, was fixed to .5 on the logit scale, and 5 time periods were used for all conditions. The simulation results indicated that, on average, there was no bias associated with the fixed effect estimates or their standard errors for any of the 81 combinations of simulation conditions. However, on average, more severe negative bias was observed for the variance component estimates for conditions where there were 30 clusters with a within-cluster sample size of 5."

            "text": "All of the studies utilizing a ML-DTSA described so far have assumed purely clustered\ndata. In such cases, the use of an ML-DTS model accounts for the dependency that exists within the nested data structure by separating out the effects at each of the nested levels (Fielding & Goldstein, 2006). Such a pure hierarchy, where level-1 units are nested into level-2 clusters, can be depicted using a network diagram. For example, Figure 2 is a network diagram depicting a two-level purely clustered data structure where students (level-1) are nested in schools (level-2).\n29\nHowever, in the social and behavioral sciences, applied researchers rarely encounter such simple multilevel data structures. Instead, data often contain complexities that mirror the real world and result in impure nesting of level-1 units into higher-level clusters.\nThere are many types of situations that result in multilevel data that are not purely nested.\nFor example, one commonly referenced scenario in educational research is when students are nested within neighborhoods and within schools. If neighborhoods were nested within schools such that students within one neighborhood went to one and only one school, the data are purely clustered and can be analyzed using a conventional three-level hierarchical linear model (Raudenbush, 1993). However, in reality, it is more likely that one school consists of students from multiple neighborhoods, and a neighborhood will contain students who go to multiple schools (Raudenbush, 1993). Instead, students (level-1) are said to be cross-classified by neighborhoods (Factor A, level-2) and schools (Factor B, level-2) (Fielding & Goldstein, 2006; Meyers & Beretvas, 2006).\nIn educational research, student mobility also results in complex data structures. Student\nmobility is common in the U.S., where about 12%-38.5% of students switched schools or moved between 2005 and 2010 (e.g., Ihrke & Faber, 2012; U.S. Government Accounting Office, 2010). As such, it is often the case that large datasets have high levels of student mobility. For example, in their analysis of student drop-out between 7th and 12th grade using the Flemish \u2018LOSO\u2019project (Van Damme et al., 2002), Lamote et al. (2013) found that 27.6% of students moved schools at least one time during the course of the study.\nIndeed, previous methodological studies using conventional multilevel models have\ndemonstrated the adverse effects of incorrect model specification in the presence of such complex data structures, and show that incorrectly modeling this complexity can have a negative\n30\nimpact on estimates of the standard errors for the fixed effects and variance component estimates (e.g., Cappelli et al., 2020; Chung & Beretvas, 2012; Leroux & Beretvas, 2018b; Leroux et al., 2020; Luo & Kwok, 2009, 2012; Meyers & Beretvas, 2006). Additionally, within the context of discrete-time survival analysis, just as ignoring a level of clustering tends to result in unobserved heterogeneity (Barber et al., 2000; Steele, 2003), such complex data structures may also result in another source of unobserved heterogeneity. Therefore, when mobility is ignored and omitted from the model, a possible outcome is that there will be variation in the hazard function that remains unexplained due to the resulting unobserved heterogeneity; however, no prior study has explicitly examined this. As such, in contrast to conventional multilevel models that ignore complex data structures, ignoring individual mobility across clusters in a ML-DTSA may also introduce bias into the point estimates of the fixed effects representing the hazard function. It should be expected that as the data structure becomes more complex (i.e., student mobility increases), the observed bias in the parameters representing the hazard function would become more severe.\nGiven the negative effects on parameter estimates when such data structures are not\nappropriately modeled, cross-classified random effects models (CCREMs) and multiple membership random effects models (MMREMs) have been developed and can further be extended for use in a ML-DTSA."

            "heading": "Cross-Classified Random Effects Modeling",
            "text": "When higher-level units are not purely clustered within one another, such as the previous\nexample of students cross-classified by both neighborhoods and schools, the interest may be in assessing the effect of both higher-level clusters on the outcome of interest. Figure 3 represents such a cross-classification.\n31\nNote here that students A and C both attend School 1, but live in different neighborhoods. Therefore, students are nested in a cross-classification of neighborhoods and schools, as represented by the crossed lines in the network diagram. When data are cross-classified, the traditional multilevel modeling methods previously presented are insufficient. In fact, previous research has found that incorrectly specifying a multilevel model in the presence of crossclassified data may result in bias in the variance component estimates and in the standard error estimates of the fixed effects (Luo & Kwok, 2009, 2012; Meyers & Beretvas, 2006).\nCross-classified data structures are also seen when the interest is in modeling a\ndichotomous outcome variable, such as those seen in survival analysis. For example, Nu\u00f1o and Katz (2019) used a CCREM to investigate the likelihood of youth joining a gang in relation to school and community level factors. Here, youth (level-1) were nested simultaneously into schools and communities (level-2). The use of a cross-classified model allowed the authors to partition the effects of schools and communities on the likelihood of gang membership. Lamote et al. (2013) extended the use of cross-classified modeling to DTSA, examining the hazard of student dropout when students are mobile. In such cases, a measurement occasion (level-1) is\n32\nnested within a crossing of students (level-2, Factor A) and schools (level-2, Factor B), allowing the school indicator and corresponding school characteristics to change over time as a student moves schools.\nThis approach to a discrete-time survival analysis, where impure nesting results in the\nsituation that repeated measures are nested within a cross-classification of students and schools, closely resembles the methodological work presented by Raudenbush (1993), where a crossclassified growth curve model was estimated for a continuous outcome variable. Table 2 presents a comparison of purely nested and impurely nested data structures using the illustrative data previously presented in Table 1. For example, in a purely nested data structure, student 100 is a member of school 1 for all five measurement occasions and is right-censored, and student 110 is a member of school 2 for two measurement occasions, at which time the student experienced the event. Such a data structure, where students are purely nested into schools across all measurement occasions, is conducive to the use of a purely clustered ML-DTSA. In contrast, the data structure may be considered to be cross-classified if students change schools across measurement occasions. For example, student 100 may be mobile, such that the student is a member of school 1 for 2 measurement occasions and a member of school 2 for the following 3 measurement occasions. Similarly, student 120 was a member of school 2 during the first two measurement occasions and a member of school 3 during the third measurement occasion, at which point the student was no longer a member of the risk set due to event occurrence. In this situation, where some students are mobile across clusters during the study period, the data contains an impure hierarchy and can be considered cross-classified, where measurement occasions are nested within a cross-classification of students (Factor A) and schools (Factor B).\n33\nNote. The numbers inside the cells represent the number of repeated measures. For example, in the purely clustered dataset, student 100 was a member of school 1 for 5 repeated measures.\nAs previously presented, a cross-classified discrete-time survival analysis requires that the data be formulated in the person-period format. Table 3 extends the person-period dataset depicted in Table 1 to present the illustrative cross-classified data set from Table 2. As seen in Table 3, School j changes for mobile students. For example, Student 100 moves from School 1 to School 2 between measurement occasions 2 and 3, while Student 110 remains in School 1 for measurement occasions 1 and 2, at which point that student is no longer in the dataset due to event occurrence. As such, this person-period dataset can be used to appropriately model student mobility across schools using a cross-classified discrete-time survival analysis where measurement occasions are nested within a crossing of students and schools. Adapting Lamote et al.\u2019s (2013) model specification, the parameterization of a cross-classified discrete-time survival (CC-DTS) model follows.\n34\nbe presented using notation from Lamote et al. (2013). To facilitate model interpretation, it will be assumed here that measurement occasions are nested within a crossing of students and schools. The unconditional CC-DTS model can be presented for 5 total time periods as:\nlog I )!(\"/)\n!*)!(\"/) J = [6!71'((0) + 6\"72'((0) + 6#73'((0) + 6$74'((0) + 6%75'((0)] + K(0), (10)\nwhere log I )!(\"/)\n!*)!(\"/) J represents the logit of the hazard probability at time t when student i is in\nschool j. The subscript, (BR), indexes the cross-classified factors, students (Factor A, i) and schools (Factor B, j), where the parentheses signify cross-classification, as is commonly done in the CCREM literature (e.g., Luo & Kwok, 2009, 2012; Meyers & Beretvas, 2006). 71'((0)\n35\nthrough 75'((0) are dummy variables for individual i in a school, R, that are coded as 1 for the period it represents and 0 for all other time periods. 6! through 6% are the intercept parameters and represent the average estimated log hazard odds across individuals and schools during the respective discrete-time period. The random effect, K(0), represents the random variation in the level-2 effect of clustering across all discrete-time periods while accounting for the school(s) attended by student i, and is assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of 0 and variance, L1\". L1\" represents the variation in the student outcome between-schools across all discrete-time periods.\nNote that in a typical cross-classified model, it would be expected that each of the\ncrossed-factors is given its own random effect; or in this example, a random student effect and a random school effect would be estimated. However, in this single-event discrete-time survival analysis, the event can occur for a student only once and the variance between students is accounted for by the Bernoulli distribution at level-1; therefore, only a random school effect is modeled (Lamote et al., 2013).\nConditional Cross-Classified Discrete-Time Survival Model. A conditional CC-DTS\nmodel can also be specified by including predictors at one or both levels of the model. For example, a researcher may hypothesize that a student-level characteristic, ?((0), is related to the outcome and that a school-level characteristic, O(0), may explain some of the variability in the outcome. A conditional CC-DTS model can be presented using notation from Lamote et al. (2013) as, log I )!(\"/)\n!*)!(\"/) J = M6!71'((0) + 6\"72'((0) + 6#73'((0) + 6$74'((0) + 6%75'((0)N + @!?((0) +\n@\"O(0) + K(0), (11)\n36\nwhere 6! through 6% represent the average log hazard odds for all individuals across schools when ?((0) is equal to 0 and O(0) is 0. @! represents the average log hOR of event occurrence across schools per unit change in ?((0) while holding constant other variables in the model. Additionally, @\" represents the average log hOR of event occurrence per unit change in O(0), controlling for other variables in the model. Note that here, the covariate associated with school, O(0), can change for mobile students such that when a student changes schools, the school characteristic also changes accordingly. As a proportional model, it is assumed that the effect of the covariate is the same across all discrete-time periods."

            "text": "The primary difference between a ML-DTSA and a CC-DTSA lies in the way that the\nmodels, as presented here, handle the clustering of measurement occasions, students, and schools. Given the hypothetical example of Student 100 from Table 2, who switches schools once (i.e., attends schools 1 and 2) during the five measurement occasions for which the study took place, a CC-DTSA directly models the effects of school 1 and school 2, as well as their associated characteristics, on the logit of the hazard probability for the corresponding measurement occasion for that student. For example, the predicted logit of the hazard probability for Student 100 at each of the five measurement occasions, with a student- and school-level covariate included in the model, can be represented using notation from Luo & Kwok (2012) and Lamote et al. (2013), as\nlog I )'('22,')\n!*)'('22,') J = 6!71!(!44,!) + @!?(!44,!) + @\"O(!) + K(!) at Time 1, (12)\nlog I )*('22,')\n!*)*('22,') J = 6\"72\"(!44,!) + @!?(!44,!) + @\"O(!) + K(!) at Time 2, (13)\nlog I )+('22,*)\n!*)+('22,*) J = 6#73#(!44,\") + @!?(!44,\") + @\"O(\") + K(\") at Time 3, (14)\n37\nlog I ),('22,*)\n!*),('22,*) J = 6$74$(!44,\") + @!?(!44,\") + @\"O(\") + K(\") at Time 4, and (15)\nlog I )-('22,*)\n!*)-('22,*) J = 6%75%(!44,\") + @!?(!44,\") + @\"O(\") + K(\") at Time 5. (16)\nHere, log I )'('22,')\n!*)'('22,') J through log I )-('22,*) !*)-('22,*) J represent the logit of the hazard probability for\neach measurement occasion, one through five, for Student 100 who attends Schools 1 and 2. The hazard is conditional upon the value of ?((0) for Student 100, as well as the values of O(0) and K(0), which are allowed to change in each measurement occasion respective to school membership at that time. Therefore, it can be seen that during each measurement occasion, the predicted logit of the hazard probability for event occurrence is estimated for Student 100 using the school and its associated characteristics that was attended by the student during a given measurement occasion. Here, during periods 1 and 2, Student 100 was a member of school 1, and therefore, during each of these measurement occasions the effect of school 1 is represented by the random effect for that school, K!, and its associated school characteristic, O! (Equations 12 through 13). When the student moves to school 2, the effect of school 2 on the predicted logit of the hazard probability for a given time period is estimated conditional on its associated schoollevel predictor, O\", and its random effect, K\" (Equations 14 through 16). Multiple Membership Random Effects Modeling\nMobility of individuals across clusters can also be modeled using a MMREM. The\nmultiple membership data structure can be viewed as a special case of the cross-classified structure, where some lower level units are members of more than one higher-level unit of the same type (Fielding & Goldstein, 2006). For example, given a simple two-level data structure where students (level-1) are nested within schools (level-2), it is possible that the dataset contains some students who have attended multiple schools over time. In such cases, students\n38\nwho do not stay in one school can be characterized as \u201cmobile\u201d and result in a multiple membership data structure. Figure 4 presents a multiple membership data structure, where some students are members of more than one school. Here, it can be seen that, for example, students a, d, g, and h attend more than one school, as represented by the dashed lines. In other words, these students can be considered mobile. This resulting data structure, where some individuals (e.g., students) belong to more than one cluster (e.g., schools) is called a multiple membership data structure.\nstructures can be accounted for in a multilevel discrete-time survival model. For example, in addition to specifying a cross-classified discrete-time survival model, Lamote et al. (2013) also specified a multiple membership discrete-time survival model to examine student dropout when some students attended multiple schools. Adapting Lamote et al.\u2019s (2013) model specification, the parameterization of a multiple membership discrete-time survival model follows.\nUnconditional Multiple Membership Discrete-Time Survival Model. A multiple\nmembership discrete-time survival model can be presented using notation from Lamote et al. (2013). To facilitate model interpretation, it will be assumed here that individuals (level-1) are\n39\nnested within schools (level-2). The unconditional multiple membership discrete-time survival model can be presented for 5 total time periods as:\nlog I )!\"{/}\n!*)!\"{/} J = M6!71'({0} + 6\"72'({0} + 6#73'({0} + 6$74'({0} + 6%75'({0}N +\n\u2211 V()K))\u2208{0} (17)\nwhere log I )!\"{/}\n!*)!\"{/} J is the logit of the hazard probability for individual i who is a member of a set\nof schools {R} during time period t. The subscript {R} indexes the set of schools associated with an individual over time. 71'({0} through 75'({0} are dummy variables for individual i in a set of schools, {R}, that are coded as 1 for the period it represents and 0 for all other time periods. 6! through 6% represent the average log hazard odds for all individuals and all schools at their respective time periods. The weights (wih) are assigned to the student\u2019s association with each\nschool, h, in the set of schools {j}, and for each student . A brief discussion of the\nassignment of weights will follow, but it is important to note that the specification of weights is done a priori by the researcher. The random effect, K4), represents the random variation in the level-2 effect of clustering across all discrete-time periods while accounting for the set of schools attended by student i, and is assumed to be normally distributed with a mean of 0 and variance, L1\". For example, L1\" represents the variation in the student outcome between-schools across all discrete-time periods.\nConditional Multiple Membership Discrete-Time Survival Model. A conditional\nmultiple membership discrete-time survival model can also be specified by including predictors at one or both levels of the model. For example, a researcher may hypothesize that an individuallevel characteristic, ?({0}, is related to the outcome and that a cluster-level characteristic, O), may\n{ } 1ih h j w \u00ce =\u00e5\n40\nexplain some of the variability in the outcome. A conditional multiple membership discrete-time survival model can be presented using notation from Lamote et al. (2013) as,\nLog I )!\"{/}\n!*)!\"{/} J = M6!71'({0} + 6\"72'({0} + 6#73'({0} + 6$74'({0} + 6%75'({0}N + @!?({0} +\n\u2211 V()(@\"O) + K)))\u2208{0} (18)\nwhere 6! through 6% represent the average log hazard odds for all individuals across schools when ?({0} is equal to 0 and the average contribution of the level-2 predictor O) across all schools in set {R} is 0. Note that here, the level-2 covariate, O), is also weighted in the same way as the level-2 random effect, such that it is the average contribution of the set of schools, {R}. @\" represents the average log hOR of event occurrence per unit change in O), controlling for other variables in the model. Additionally, @! represents the average log hOR of event occurrence across schools per unit change in ?({0} while holding constant other values in the model. As a proportional model, it is assumed that the effect of the covariates on the logit scale is the same across all discrete-time periods."

            "heading": "A Brief Comparison of the MM-DTS and the CC-DTS Models",
            "text": "The MM-DTS and the CC-DTS models, as presented here, are similar in that they\naccount for the mobility of students across schools. However, as opposed to the CC-DTS model, the MM-DTS model uses a weighting scheme where the weights (wih) are assigned to the student\u2019s association with each school in the set of schools attended by a student. The choice of weights that will be assigned in the model are objective and determined by the researcher, but are important to accurately depict what is happening in reality (Fielding & Goldstein, 2006). For example, an applied researcher might assign a weight for each school in the set of schools attended by each student such that it is proportional to the amount of time that a student was enrolled at that school (Wolff Smith & Beretvas, 2014b). Again, this can be illustrated using the\n41\nperson-period data for Student 100 from Table 3, who attended school 1 and school 2 for 2 periods and 3 periods, respectively, across five measurement occasions. Using the MM-DTS model, the contribution of each of the two schools and their associated characteristics could be modeled such that, log $ !!\"{$,&}\"# !!\"{$,&}% = '61(1\"%%{\",(} + 62(2\"%%{\",(} + 63(3\"%%{\",(} + 64(4\"%%{\",(} + 65(5\"%%{\",(}0 +\n@11\"%%{\",(} + @2( ( *3\" + + *3() + ( *5\" + + *5(. (19)\nTherefore, the MM-DTS models the school(s) and their associated characteristics as a weighted set attended by a given student. This is in contrast to the CC-DTS model, where the school attended by a student is not assigned a weight, but rather, depends on the measurement occasion for which data are collected on a student. Therefore, the use of a CC-DTS model directly models the effect of changing schools and their associated characteristics, as represented by Equations 12 through 16, while the MM-DTS model indirectly models the effect of schools on student outcomes by assigning weights a priori to the clustering units, as represented by Equation 19.\nThis direct and indirect modeling of the effect of school on the outcome has important\nimplications for the interpretation of the model estimates. Specifically, a MM-DTSA models the effect of school as cumulative, while for the CC-DTS model, the effect of school is noncumulative. When the effect of school is modeled as cumulative, all schools in the set of schools contribute to the outcome according to their assigned weight; conversely, when the effect is modeled as noncumulative, the effect of previous schools attended disappears when students move schools. For the CC-DTS model, Equations 12-16 illustrate this noncumulative effect of school. Note that in each Equation, 12-16, the effect of school depends entirely on the school that a student is a member of during a respective time period, such that measurement occasions are nested within a cross-classification of students and schools. For example, Equation 15 models\n42\nthe effect of School 2 attended by Student 100 on the logit of the hazard probability during time period 4. The effect of the previous school attended (i.e., School 1), does not factor into the logit of the hazard probability at Period 4. In contrast, a MM-DTSA models the effect of schools as cumulative, such that each school in the set of schools attended contributes to the associated current and subsequent logit of the hazard probability values. Note that this specification also means that schools attended at later time periods are modeled as impacting the hazard probability in earlier time periods, which may not accurately depict reality. In contrast, the non-cumulative effect of school modeled by a CC-DTSA may better represent reality in a given time period, but may not represent reality well at later time periods, where it is likely that previous schools attended contribute to proceeding student outcomes."

            "text": "Methodological research for cross-classified and multiple membership data structures\nhave been conducted using both cross-sectional and longitudinal data. In the case of crosssectional data, methodological research has indicated that inappropriately modeling impure clustering results in biased estimates of the variance components and standard errors of the fixed effects (Chung & Beretvas, 2012; Chung et al., 2018; Dunn et al., 2015; Luo & Kwok, 2009; Meyers & Beretvas, 2006; Ren, 2011; Wolff Smith & Beretvas, 2014a, 2017). Luo and Kwok (2009) found that the direction and magnitude of bias in these estimates is influenced by the structure of cross-classification and the degree to which the data are cross-classified. In other words, as individual mobility across clusters increases in the dataset, the bias associated with the variance components and standard errors of the fixed effects will also increase. The variance redistribution observed by Luo and Kwok (2009) partly explains contrasting findings in the methodological literature for MMREMs; for example, while Chung and Beretvas (2012) and\n43\nWolff-Smith and Beretvas (2014a) observed bias in both the individual- and cluster-level variance component estimates, Wolff Smith and Beretvas (2017) did not observe any bias in the estimate of the level-1 variance component across any model. In the case of longitudinal data, methodological studies have resulted in similar findings (Cappelli et al., 2020; Choi & Wilson, 2016; Grady, 2010; Grady & Beretvas, 2010; Leroux, 2019; Leroux & Beretvas, 2018a, 2018b; Leroux et al., 2020; Luo & Kwok, 2012). Studies using real data have found that model estimates differ between misspecified models and models that correctly account for mobility for both linear and nonlinear growth curve models (Grady & Beretvas, 2010; Leroux, 2019; Leroux & Beretvas, 2018a). Simulation studies have further examined these differences to describe the direction and magnitude of bias in both correctly specified and misspecified models, and indicate that inappropriately modeling individual-level mobility across clusters results in substantial bias in model estimates at the cluster-level, specifically in the variance components and in the impact of the covariates on growth rates (Cappelli et al., 2020; Choi & Wilson, 2016; Grady, 2010; Leroux & Beretvas, 2018b; Leroux et al., 2020; Luo & Kwok, 2012).\nImportantly, this methodological research has provided insights regarding the study\nfactors that may contribute to bias observed in model estimates when using CCREMs and MMREMs. For example, studies have indicated that cluster size is an important contributor of bias in MMREMs and CCREMS, where larger cluster sizes are more important than withincluster sample sizes to mitigate bias in parameter estimates (Chen & Leroux, 2018; Vassallo et al., 2017; Wolff Smith & Beretvas, 2017). Even larger cluster-level sample sizes may be needed when using longitudinal data, where some methodological work has suggested that appropriately modeling mobility using longitudinal models without bias may require 100 or more clustering units (Leroux & Beretvas, 2018b; Leroux et al., 2020). In addition to these methodological\n44\nfindings, Moerbeek and Safarkhani (2018) conducted an analytical study to provide formulas that can be used to calculate the necessary sample size to achieve the desired level of statistical power when using cross-classified designs.\nAdditionally, other studies have examined the impact of the misspecification of weights\nused to represent the theoretical contribution of the cluster-level unit on mobile individuals when modeling mobility using an MMREM. While Wolff Smith and Beretvas (2014b) found that the MMREM is robust against the choice of weight patterns used to model the effect of multiple higher level units on a lower level unit, Galindo (2015) and Durrant et al. (2018) found that when mobility is generated more realistically, weight specification impacts the relative parameter bias of the cluster-level random effects\u2019 variance component in some simulated conditions.\nMethodological Literature for Survival Analysis. Cross-classified and multiple\nmembership modeling approaches can also be extended to incorporate both continuous-time and discrete-time survival outcomes. However, few methodological studies have been conducted in either continuous-time or discrete-time survival analysis with complex data structures.\nCafri and Fan (2018) proposed and evaluated a continuous-time survival model for cross-\nclassified data against a model that ignored the complex data structure. Simulation results indicated that the model that accounted for the cross-classified data structure resulted in no bias in parameter estimates, while the modeling approach that ignored the complex data structure was found to result in substantial bias in estimates of the cluster-level variance component. Additionally, Elghafghuf et al. (2014) proposed and evaluated a Cox model with both crossclassified and multiple membership frailties (CMM Cox Model). Overall, it was found that the CCM Cox Model performs better when mobility is higher and when variance components are larger. Additionally, the level-3 random effect for one crossed-factor was found to be biased,\n45\nalthough this is likely attributable to the small cluster-level sample size used in the simulation study.\nOnly one study has investigated the use of a discrete-time survival model in the presence\nof individual mobility across clusters. Lamote et al. (2013) applied both a cross-classified and multiple membership discrete-time survival model to data with impure clustering. This study served two purposes, (1) an applied study of student drop-out and (2) a methodological study of discrete-time survival modeling techniques. As an applied study, Lamote et al. (2013) examined the effect of student and school characteristics on dropout hazard among students over a six-year period, specifically interested in the timing and occurrence of student risk for dropout. As a methodological study, the authors considered the hierarchical structure of the dataset and examined the resulting estimates of different hierarchical discrete-time survival models, including models that ignore student mobility and both a MM-DTS and a CC-DTS model. Lamote et al. (2013) found that the unconditional MM-DTSA returned a higher Deviance Information Criterion value than both a model where student mobility was ignored and the CCDTSA, indicating that the MM-DTSA yielded a poorer model fit. Additionally, model estimates, including those for the fixed effects representing the baseline hazard probability and the clusterlevel variance component, differed in models that appropriately modeled mobility and alternative ad hoc approaches. While Lamote et al. (2013) integrated both multiple membership and crossclassified models into discrete-time survival modeling, their work included only a real-data analysis. As such, while differences were seen between models that accounted for student mobility and models that assumed a pure hierarchical data structure, it is not known which model estimates were estimated without bias, or if bias was present, the magnitude of that bias.\n46\nThe purpose of this study was to build upon the work of Lamote et al. (2013) in discrete-\ntime survival analysis in the presence of student mobility. Given the authors\u2019 findings that the CC-DTSA better fit the data containing student mobility than the MM-DTSA, this dissertation focused on the use of the CC-DTS model to appropriately model individual mobility across clusters. The following chapter presents the methods used to conduct a simulation study. The simulation study assessed the performance of a cross-classified discrete-time survival model under a variety of research contexts, and describes bias seen in the model estimates as compared to models that ignore individual mobility across clusters.\n47\nCHAPTER 3\nMETHODOLOGY\nThe primary purpose of this dissertation was to assess the impact of ignoring a cross-\nclassified data structure due to individual mobility across clusters in a discrete-time survival analysis, and further, to investigate how the baseline hazard function, variability of the cluster random effect, mobility rate, and within- and between-cluster sample size impact the performance of a cross-classified discrete-time survival model. The research questions that were addressed specifically examined the performance of a correctly specified CC-DTS model against a ML-DTS model that modeled only the first cluster (i.e., school) of the set of clusters that mobile individuals were associated with during the course of the study. Under the approach that ignored individual mobility across clusters, the effects of multiple clusters were not modeled for mobile individuals who were exposed to multiple contexts. Essentially, to conduct a conventional multilevel discrete-time survival analysis (ML-DSTA), researchers modify the complex data structure to a purely hierarchical data structure by ignoring mobility. Additionally, a single-level discrete-time survival analysis (DTSA), which also ignored the hierarchical structure of the data, was compared to the multilevel and cross-classified analyses.\nThis chapter continues with a discussion of the simulation study procedures. First, the\nsimulation study design, including the manipulated conditions proposed, is discussed. Following the proposed data generation procedures, the model estimation procedures are described, and finally, the analyses for examining parameter recovery are presented."

Prior to beginning the literature review, it was necessary to set guidelines for the types of studies to be included; therefore, inclusion criteria were established to guide this literature review, as follows:\n\u2022 Manuscript must be an applied educational research study \u2022 Study must be related to educational research in a K-12 setting\n\u2022 The primary focus of the study is related to student outcomes\n\u2022 Study must use one of the following models for the analysis of binary outcome data:\n(1) HGLM, (2) MMREM, (3) CCREM, (4) DTS model, (5) MM-DTS model, (6) CCDTS model To search for this literature, multiple databases were used, such as Academic Search\nComplete, Education Source, PsychInfo, and ERIC (EBSCO). The databases were broadly\n49\nsearched, and studies that appeared to meet the inclusion criteria presented above were further reviewed. The search was not constrained by any fields (i.e., dates of publication, authors, etc.). While numerous search terms were used, the first search term used was \u201cDiscrete-time survival analysis AND Education\u201d. This search term produced limited literature from each of the databases. For example, at the time of this writing, using this search term in the ERIC (EBSCO) database yielded 34 publications that were broadly related to education and utilized a discretetime survival analysis, but either may not be considered educational research or did not meet the inclusion criteria for educational research defined above (i.e., student outcomes in K-12 education). For example, studies that did not meet the inclusion criteria but appeared in the search included those with primary research questions related to public health (i.e., emergence of depression, first time consuming alcohol, first time using cigarettes, etc.) rather than educational research specifically, but the research was conducted using school-based data sources. Other studies that appeared in the initial search, but were excluded, included educational research studies that took place outside of a K-12 setting, such as those in the university context. Consequently, more broad search terms were used in an attempt to capture studies that used binary outcome variables, but were not necessarily conducted using a discrete-time survival analysis. For example, the search terms included, but were not limited to, \u201cDiscrete-Time Survival Models AND Education\u201d, \u201cDiscrete-Time Survival Analysis AND Education\u201d, \u201cDiscrete-Time Survival Analysis AND Schools\u201d, \u201cDiscrete-Time Survival Analysis AND Students\u201d, \u201cBinary Outcome AND Education\u201d, \u201cDichotomous Outcome AND Education\u201d, \u201cHierarchical Generalized Linear Model AND Schools\u201d, \u201cHierarchical Generalized Linear Model AND Students\u201d, \u201cEvent history model of student dropout\u201d. Search terms also included binary outcome variables commonly seen in educational research, such as, \u201cDiscrete-Time\n50\nSurvival Analysis AND Student Retention\u201d, \u201cHGLM AND Graduation\u201d, \u201cDiscrete-Time Survival Analysis AND Dropout\u201d.\nIn conducting this search, abstracts were first reviewed to ensure that the study met the\ninclusion criteria. While many studies were found through this process, subsequent reviews of the manuscripts revealed that they did not always contain the information necessary to produce generating values. For example, in some studies, descriptive statistics for the overall sample were not included in the manuscript and could not be calculated given the provided information. In other studies, a discrete-time survival analysis was conducted, but time was constrained such that a hazard probability was not estimated for each measurement occasion, and therefore, the study could not be used to inform the generating values for hazard probabilities in this study. Therefore, a total of 14 studies were identified that met the inclusion criteria and were specifically used to choose generating values for this simulation study, which included values for level-1 and level-2 covariates, as well as values for the hazard probabilities. A summary of these studies is provided in Appendices A, B, and C. Specifically, Appendix A presents a summary of the studies used to inform generating values for the hazard probabilities on the logit scale, Appendix B provides a summary of estimated level-1 coefficient values for dichotomous covariates, and Appendix C provides a summary of studies from which the coefficient values for dichotomous level-2 covariates were culled.

The methodological literature has explored the effects of cluster sizes of between 20 and 150 on model estimates for CCREMs and MMREMs. In the continuous-outcome cross-sectional literature, it has been found that smaller cluster sizes of 20- 40 have resulted in biased estimates of cluster-level variance components (Chen & Leroux, 2018; Chung & Beretvas, 2012; Chung et al., 2018; Wheelis, 2017; Wolff Smith & Beretvas, 2017). Luo and Kwok (2012) used a longitudinal CCREM to model student mobility across clusters using cluster-level sample sizes of 25 and 50, and found that higher cluster sizes resulted in less bias when mobility was present in the data. While no simulation studies have been conducted to examine the effect of the cluster-level sample size on model estimates for a CC-DTS model, Lamote et al. (2013) used the CC-DTS model with a dataset that consisted of 55 schools at the cluster-level. Given previous findings in the literature for longitudinal data where individual mobility across clusters was present, it is important to examine the effect of the cluster-level sample size on model estimates for the CC-DTS model. Therefore, the cluster-level sample sizes in this study were set to 30, 50, and 100 to investigate model performance."

Commonly, it was found that the cluster-level sample size had a greater influence on parameter recovery than the individual-level sample size, although increases in the within-cluster sample size generally resulted in moderate gains in parameter precision (Chen & Leroux, 2018; Chung & Beretvas, 2012; Luo & Kwok, 2009, 2012; Meyers & Beretvas, 2006; Vassallo et al., 2017; Wolff Smith & Beretvas, 2014a, 2017).

However, note that due to the nature of the person-period dataset, the specified within-cluster sample sizes were only applicable to the first time-period.

            "text": "In educational research using multilevel discrete-time survival analysis, methodological\nstudies have manipulated the estimated residual variance at the cluster-level, L1\", to examine the impacts of the between-cluster variance on parameter estimates. The variance at the cluster-level is more interpretable when redefined as an intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Formally, the ICC is defined as the proportion of the total variance in the outcome that is attributable to variability among the cluster-level units. Previous methodological research using ML-DTS analysis has manipulated the variance between-clusters, and therefore, the ICC. For example, Moerbeek (2012) and Elghafghud et al. (2014) conducted simulation studies to explore the performance of survival models in the presence of clustered data structures. Findings suggested that when the ICC increases, under certain combinations of conditions fixed effect estimates may\n53\nbe negatively impacted, but the cluster-level variance component may be better estimated in conditions that include a larger ICC.\nAlthough there are few applied studies that have utilized a multilevel discrete-time\nsurvival analysis approach in educational research, those that exist have reported a wide range of values for the variance between-clusters in conditional models, and therefore, a wide range of residual ICC values. For example, Davoudzadeh et al. (2015) reported ICC values that ranged from .003 to .13 and Petras et al. (2011) reported a residual ICC of .01. In the only study utilizing a CC-DTS model, Lamote et al. (2013) reported residual ICCs that ranged from .042 to .28. Therefore, in this study, the between-cluster variance component value was manipulated to be equal to 0.32 or 1.09, which are equivalent to residual ICC values of .10 and .25, defined here as small and large ICCs. Refer to Technical Appendix A for further information regarding the calculation of the residual ICC used in this dissertation, given between-cluster variance component values of 0.32 and 1.09."

            "text": "The interest in this study was to explore the effect of the overall mobility rate in the\ndataset on model estimates. Studies from the applied educational research literature that specifically examined student mobility have reported varying rates of mobility in their study samples, typically ranging from 15% to 50% mobility (Gruman et al, 2008; Nelson et al., 1996; Taniguchi, 2017). Additionally, Lash and Kirkpatrick (1990) reported that, in the United States, 19% of students move in any given year, with younger students experiencing even higher rates of mobility. For example, Kerbow (1996) stated that in studies of Chicago\u2019s Public Schools, upwards of 62% of elementary school students switched schools during their elementary school years. These mobility rates are also supported by more recent government statistics, which\n54\nsuggest that in the United States, about 12%-38.5% of students switched schools or moved between 2005 and 2010 (Ihrke & Faber, 2012; U.S. Government Accounting Office, 2010). In the methodological literature, the majority of simulation studies have examined the impact of mobility rates between 10% and 35% (e.g., Cappelli et al., 2020; Chen & Leroux, 2018; Chung & Beretvas, 2012; Galindo, 2015; Leroux & Beretvas, 2018b; Leroux et al., 2020; Luo & Kwok, 2012). Additionally, Wheelis (2017) and Luo and Kwok (2012) explored the impact of mobility rates as low as 5% on bias in model estimates when complex data structures were inappropriately modeled. These studies found that mobility rates exceeding 10% typically result in bias in the estimate of the cluster-level predictor coefficient and the cluster-level variance component of the model that does not correctly account for mobility. Therefore, for this study, individual mobility rates of 10%, 20%, and 30% were explored."

            "text": "In educational research utilizing discrete-time survival analysis, it is usually seen that\nsurvival at the end of the study remains relatively high; in other words, the overall rate of event occurrence among the sample is low. For example, in a study by Davoudazadeh et al. (2015) that examined the first occurrence of grade retention, 13% of the sample experienced the event by the end of the study. In a study of student dropout by Lamote et al. (2013), about 11% of the sample experienced the event, while higher occurrences of dropout of between 20% and 30% of the overall sample were seen in other studies (Bowers, 2010; Orozco, 2016). A summary of the findings from this literature can be found in Appendix A. In methodological research that varied the proportion of event occurrence, it was found that in some cases, especially when sample sizes were small, low rates event occurrence (25%) resulted in greater amounts of bias in some model parameters than higher rates of event occurrence among the sample (Moerbeek & Hesen, 2018;\n55\nMoerbeek & Schormans, 2015). Therefore, this study manipulated the survival patterns among individuals in the generated datasets using the Weibull survival function. A Weibull survival function was used to calculate the hazard probabilities at each of the five time periods generated in each dataset. As such, the hazard probability at each time period, h(t), was calculated as, \u210e(+) = 6Z+(>*!), where 6 is the Weibull shape parameter, Z is a Weibull scale parameter, and + represents the time period, 1 through 5. For the purposes of this dissertation, the shape parameter, 6, was always equal to 1.5. However, the scale parameter, Z, had two levels, .05 and 0.025. When the scale parameter was equal to 0.05, the survival at the end of the five time periods was equal to 51%, and when the scale parameter was equal to 0.025, the survival at the end of the five time periods was equal to 73%. The hazard probabilities can be calculated using the equation previously presented and providing the values of the shape (i.e., 1.5) and scale parameters (i.e., 0.05 or 0.025). For example, when the scale parameter was equal to 0.05, the hazard probability at the first time period was calculated as, \u210e(+) = (1.5)(.05)(1)(!.%*!), which is equal to .075, or a logit hazard value of \u22122.51. This procedure was also conducted for each time period by changing the value of t to be equal to the time period, 1 through 5, resulting in hazard probabilities of .075, .106, .130, .150, and .168, which are equivalent to logit hazard values of \u22122.51, \u22122.13, \u22121.90, \u22121.74, and \u22121.60. Following the same procedures, but changing the scale parameter to 0.025, the hazard probabilities are equal to .038, .053, .065, .075, and .084, which are equivalent to logit hazard values of \u22123.25, \u22122.88, \u22122.67, \u22122.51, and \u22122.39. A further discussion of event occurrence, hazard functions, the number of time periods, and the survival pattern for the generated dataset is provided below.\nIn summary, the performance of the DTS model, the ML-DTS model, and the CC-DTS\nmodel were assessed using 72 simulation conditions from the combination of 5 factors in a fully\n56\ncrossed design (Table 4). As the aim of this study was to provide both methodological and applied researchers with insights regarding the performance of each model in the presence of individual mobility across clusters, the factors and their associated levels chosen for manipulation represent those that were common in applied research, and as described, have been commonly found to have substantial effects in models that ignore complex data structures when they are present. Additionally, although Lamote et al. (2013) conducted a real-data study that compared the CC-DTS model to other DTS models, this was the first simulation study to model a DTSA in the presence of a cross-classified data structure, and therefore, it is important to describe parameter recovery using the CC-DTS model when these factors are manipulated."

Therefore, this study examined discrete-time survival models in the context of a study with 5 discrete-time periods. Additionally, while the pattern of the hazard probability (i.e., increasing, decreasing, or constant) varied in each of these studies, previous simulation research has indicated that the survival pattern does not have an effect on bias in the estimates of the parameters when using a ML-DTSA (Moerbeek, 2012). Given that in the types of outcomes often examined in educational research (e.g., student dropout), hazard commonly increases over time, this dissertation utilized an increasing hazard function. Therefore, for each of the levels of the Weibull scale parameter condition, the resulting hazard function was generated such that there were five discrete-time periods with hazard probabilities that increased over time, where the greatest hazard probability for event occurrence occurred in later time periods."

            "text": "Student mobility was generated according to the level of the mobility condition for the\nsample size in the simulated dataset, as determined by the cluster sample size and within-cluster sample size conditions. For example, for the level of the mobility condition where 10% of students were mobile for a dataset generated using 100 clusters (i.e., schools) and a withincluster sample size of 50 (i.e., 50 students per school), the total sample size in the simulated dataset was 5,000 students. Therefore, 500 students were randomly selected to be mobile. Mobility was generated such that the level of the mobility condition was applied identically in each generated dataset. In other words, the mobility rate was the rate of individual mobility in the sample generated in each of the 1,000 datasets generated per unique combination of conditions. For example, when a combination of conditions included 10% of students to be mobile, all 1,000\n58\ngenerated datasets were generated to randomly select 10% of students to be mobile. This procedure for mobility generation has been used in previous methodological studies (Cappelli et al., 2020; Choi & Wilson, 2016; Chung & Beretvas, 2012; Luo & Kwok, 2012; Meyers & Beretvas, 2006; Wolff Smith & Beretvas, 2017). For those students chosen to be mobile, subsequent schools attended were determined by their current School ID + 1. For example, for a dataset with 100 clusters, a mobile student in School 1 was assigned to School 2, but a mobile student in School 100 was assigned to School 1.\nAdditionally, given the longitudinal nature of discrete-time survival analysis, it is\nprobable that in reality, students may move more than once. Furthermore, students may move in different time periods. In regards to the maximum number of times that a student is able to move, the existing literature regarding student mobility indicated that it is most common for mobile students to move schools only once during a study period; however, mobile students may also move schools two times, with very few moving more than two times. For example, in applied educational research, Gruman et al. (2008) and Lamote et al. (2013) reported that the majority of mobile students in their study samples moved only once (66% and 88%, respectively), and a lesser majority moved twice (25% and 27.6%, respectively). Kerbow (1996) reported that only 13% of elementary school students in Chicago\u2019s public schools attended four or more schools during a six-year period. Additionally, existing methodological research that explored the impacts of student mobility has used a variety of mobility patterns. For example, in some methodological studies, mobile students changed schools only once, such that they attended a maximum of two schools (e.g., Cappelli et al., 2020; Choi & Wilson, 2016; Grady, 2010; Leroux et al., 2020; Wolff Smith & Beretvas, 2014a). However, in other methodological research, mobile students were allowed to change schools more than once (e.g., Chung & Beretvas, 2012;\n59\nLeroux & Beretvas, 2018a; Luo & Kwok, 2012; Wolff Smith & Beretvas, 2014b, 2017). For example, in a methodological study using real data, Leroux (2019) reported that 86.7% of the study sample moved schools only once, while the remaining mobile students moved more than once. Similarly, Leroux and Beretvas (2018b) generated data for a simulation study such that only 15.5% of mobile students moved twice, while the remaining students moved only once. Therefore, for this study, the majority of mobile students moved only once and some mobile students were allowed to move two times. Specifically, 80% of mobile students were assigned to move schools once (i.e., attend 2 schools), and the remaining 20% of mobile students were assigned to move schools twice (i.e., attend 3 schools), as described in Table 5. For example, following the previously described situation where a dataset with 5,000 students and a 10% mobility rate results in 500 students being randomly assigned to be mobile, 400 students (80%) were assigned to move schools once, and the remaining 100 students (20%) were assigned to move schools two times.\nAs previously mentioned, due to the longitudinal nature of discrete-time survival\nanalysis, it was also necessary to specify when those students who were randomly chosen to be mobile would move. Therefore, a set procedure was specified that was the same for each dataset, regardless of the level of the mobility condition, such that mobile students were assigned a time period in which to move. The proportion of mobile students assigned to move in each time period is outlined in Table 5. As illustrated in Table 5, the data generation procedure resulted in the majority of students being assigned to move in earlier time periods as opposed to later time periods. However, note that due to the discrete-nature of the measurement occasions, mobility was always 0% during period 1. As opposed to previous methodological research examining mobility, this CC-DTSA utilized the person-period dataset, as presented in Table 3. Therefore, as\n60\nstudents experienced the event, they were no longer included in the dataset for subsequent time periods. Thus, the student mobility procedure described in Table 5 was specifically designed to maximize the likelihood that a mobile student would both move and experience the event; in other words, a mobile student was less likely to be removed from the dataset due to event occurrence prior to the time period in which they were assigned to be mobile.\ntwice by time period 3. Additionally, the percentage of mobile students assigned to move schools decreased across time, such that mobility was highest between time periods 1 and 2 with no mobility between time periods 4 and 5. Again drawing from the example of a generated dataset that contained 500 mobile students, 400 students were assigned to move only once, of whom 200 were assigned to move during time period 2, 150 were assigned to move during time period 3, and 50 were assigned to move during time period 4. An additional 100 students were assigned to move twice, 50 of whom were assigned to move in both time periods 2 and 3, and the remaining 50 in time periods 2 and 4. Again, regardless of the level of the mobility condition, the proportion of students assigned to move once or twice and the proportion of students assigned to move during each time period always remained the same. It is important to note that individual mobility was generated independent of event occurrence in each dataset. Therefore, while the\n61\noverall rates of mobility were specified to be equal to the level of the mobility conditions (10%, 20%, or 30%), and mobility in each time period was specified to occur as described in Table 5, as students were removed from the risk set, the overall mobility and mobility per time period was not exactly equal to the described procedures. The actual rates of individual mobility across clusters across the generated datasets is provided later in this dissertation.\nStudent mobility was not modeled using the conditional DTS or ML-DTS models;\ninstead, the DTS model ignored the clustering of students into schools, while the ML-DTS model was estimated using only cluster-level characteristics from the first school attended by a student, resulting in a purely hierarchical data structure. However, for the CC-DTS model, mobility was modeled by structuring the data such that measurement occasions were nested within a crossing of students and schools. In other words, by modeling the cross-classified data structure with a CC-DTS model, the school identification and its corresponding characteristics were allowed to change at each measurement occasion as students moved schools."

For example, demographic variables such as race, gender, socioeconomic status, language spoken at home, among others have been found to be associated with educational outcomes (e.g., Carpenter & Ramirez, 2007; Schifter, 2016; Werblow & Duesbery, 2009). In other studies, gender has been identified as an important predictor, or has been used as a control variable in the model (Cha, 2015; Ma & Willms, 1999). Consistently, gender and race were examined in applied studies in relation to binary outcome variables. Therefore, in this study, the student-level predictor, ?((0), was a dichotomous variable, where 50% of the sample were generated to have a value of 0 and the remaining 50% were generated to have a value of 1. This most closely resembles the proportions observed for the \u201cGender\u201d variable in applied research. Additionally, as seen in the results of the studies summarized in Appendix B, the estimated coefficient on the logit scale most often indicated that males were more likely to experience the event than females. Therefore, the generating value for the coefficient of the student-level covariate used in this study was set to 0.50 on the logit scale. This corresponds to a hazard odds ratio (hOR) of 1.65, suggesting that, for example, the odds of event occurrence are greater for male students (coded 1) than they are for female students (coded 0).\nAdditionally, previous research was examined to generate a realistic cluster-level variable\nand its associated coefficient. In the educational research literature, student mobility was often\n63\nfound to be associated with variables such as school location and school type. For example, some researchers have argued that student mobility is most prevalent in urban schools, as compared to suburban or rural schools (Kerbow, 1996; Lash & Kirkpatrick, 1990). Indeed, the applied literature has also examined various educational outcomes in relation to variables such as school type or school location (e.g., Carpenter & Ramirez, 2007; Cha, 2015; Werblow & Duesbery, 2009). Given this research, it is likely that a study that accounts for both student mobility and has a discrete-time survival endpoint in the United States educational context will have a variable included in the model related to school type (i.e., public or private) or school location (i.e., urban, rural, suburban, etc.). In other words, a dichotomous variable at the clustering-level of the model is likely. Therefore, the cluster (i.e., school) predictor, O(0), used in this study was also a dichotomous variable, where 30% of schools were generated to have a value of 1 and the remaining 70% had a value of 0. These values are similar to those reported by Cha (2015) and Taniguchi (2017) in the applied literature, who both used dummy-coded variables representing school location, where rural or suburban schools were coded as the reference category at level two in their models. Furthermore, in educational research using HGLM or ML-DTS models, it is most common for the values of the coefficients for level-2 variables to range from about \u22120.50 to 0.70 on the logit scale. Therefore, following Moerbeek (2012), this study utilized a value of 0.50 on the logit scale for the level-2 coefficient. This corresponds to a hOR of 1.65, suggesting that students in schools coded as 1 have a greater likelihood of event occurrence across the study period than students in schools coded as 0. Note that although the coefficient and hOR are equivalent for the level-1 and level-2 covariate, given that the proportion of the covariates generated to equal 1 or 0 differ, the variance in the population differs. As a result, the effect of the covariate on the outcome differs.\n64\nThe random effect, K(0), was generated to be normally distributed with a mean of 0 and a\nvariance, L1\". Note that L1\" changed according to the level of the manipulated condition for the cluster-level variance component value. The outcome, event occurrence, was assigned to each student by randomly drawing a 1 (event occurrence) or 0 (event does not occur) from a Bernoulli distribution, where the estimated hazard probability for each student was entered into the function as a probability, and n trials was equal to 1.

Note that the data generating procedures differed from the estimation procedures here. Specifically, the baseline hazard function was generated according to the two levels of the Weibull scale parameter condition, which used a two-parameter Weibull function to generate hazard values for each time period. In contrast, the estimating models (i.e., the CC-DTS, the ML-DTS, and the DTS models) left the hazard function unstructured, estimating each logit hazard value from the generated data, as is common in applied research. For the DTS model, the cluster-level coefficient was estimated by disaggregating the cluster-level variable, such that all students from the same school were assigned the same value at the clustering-level.\n65"

The CC-DTS model and ML-DTS model both accounted for the multilevel data structure where individuals are nested into clustering units, and the CC-DTS model additionally handled the mobility of individuals across clusters. The DTS model did not account for either the multilevel data structure or individual mobility across clusters.\nThe estimation procedure converged for all DTS, ML-DTS, and CC-DTS models using\nthe 72,000 datasets simulated for this study.

For the DTS model, moderate or substantial RPB was found for all 36 manipulated conditions. When holding all other manipulated conditions constant, RPB increased slightly as the rate of mobility increased. However, RPB increased substantially when the between-clusters variance component value increased from 0.32 to 1.09, suggesting that there was greater RPB associated with greater variation in the outcome between-clusters. When the between-clusters variance component value was 0.32, moderate negative bias was observed, while substantial negative bias was observed for all combinations of conditions when the between-clusters variance component was equal to 1.09. For the ML-DTS model, eleven of the 36 conditions resulted in RPB of between \u22120.05 and \u22120.10, indicating moderate negative bias of the parameter. All of the combinations that resulted in unacceptable RPB occurred when the variance between-clusters was 1.09, and the majority occurred in generated datasets that included the 30% mobility condition.

In contrast, when the between-clusters variance was 1.09, the mean RPB was more substantial when the Weibull scale parameter was 0.05 than when it was 0.025. Again, when the between-clusters variance was 1.09, the difference in mean RPB by the Weibull scale parameter values was much more substantial than when it is 0.32. For the ML-DTS model, the main effect of mobility had a practically significant effect on the estimate of a4 [F(2, 71,928) = 524.96, p < .001, gC\" = 0.014], such that as the mobility rate increased, the mean RPB became more negative (M.10 = \u22120.01, M.20 = \u22120.03, M.30 = \u22120.04). Additionally, the main effect of the between-clusters variance had a practically significant effect on the estimate of a4 [F(1, 71,928) = 697.83, p < .001, gC\" = 0.010], where the RPB became more negative as the variance between-clusters increased from 0.32 to 1.09 (M0.32 = \u22120.02, M1.09 = \u22120.03). For the CC-DTS model, no practically significant main effects or interactions were apparent.\n91"

No moderate or substantial RPB was observed for any combination of conditions using any of the estimating models. Although no substantial RPB was observed, the CC-DTS model consistently performed better than the DTS and the ML-DTS models, with RPB close to 0 in all cases.\n93\nTable 15 presents the RPB for the coefficient of the intercept of discrete-time period 5 of\nthe logit hazard function, a5, across 36 combinations of conditions where the Weibull scale parameter was 0.05 for the DTS model, the ML-DTS model, and the CC-DTS model. For the DTS model, moderate or substantial RPB was observed for 16 combinations of conditions. Specifically, when all other conditions were held constant, moderate or substantial positive bias was observed when the between-clusters variance component was equal to 1.09, where the magnitude of the RPB ranged from 0.092 to 0.126. For the ML-DTS and CC-DTS model, no moderate or substantial RPB was observed for any combination of conditions.\n95\nTo further explore the practical implications of the results presented in Tables 14 and 15,\na factorial ANOVA was conducted for the coefficient, a5, where RPB was the dependent variable and the manipulated conditions were entered as independent variables for each model separately. The ANOVA results are presented in Appendix D. For the DTS model, the interaction of the between-cluster variance component and the Weibull scale parameter had a practically significant effect on the estimate of a5 [F(2, 71,928) = 5,604.57, p < .001, gC\" = 0.072], where RPB was more negative when the Weibull scale parameter was 0.025 and the between-clusters variance was equal to 1.09. The difference in the mean RPB between the Weibull scale parameters was greatest when the between-clusters variance was 1.09. For the ML-DTS model, the partial Eta-Squared indicated a practically significant effect of the main effect of the Weibull scale parameter [F(1, 71,928) = 714.73, p < .001, gC\" = 0.010]. The average RPB across all conditions when the Weibull scale parameter was 0.05 was estimated with virtually no bias, while some negative bias was observed when the Weibull scale parameter was 0.025 (M0.025 = \u22120.02, M0.05 = 0.00). There were no practically significant impacts of the manipulated conditions on the RPB for the CC-DTS model.\nSummarizing the Coefficient of the Intercepts of the Logit Hazard Function, 6!\nthrough 6%. The results suggest that for the coefficients representing the logit hazard function, a1 through a5, the most substantial RPB occurred for the DTS model, which did not account for either the multilevel data structure or individual mobility across clusters. Some moderate RPB was also apparent for the ML-DTS model, which accounted for the multilevel data structure but did not model mobility. For the ML-DTS model, moderate RPB was especially evident in the logit hazard function under the 30% mobility condition and with larger variation betweenclusters. The CC-DTS model accounted for both mobility in the dataset and the multilevel data\n96\nstructure. When the CC-DTS model was used, no moderate or substantial relative parameter bias was found for any parameter representing the logit hazard function.\nGiven the differences between models in RPB for the coefficients representing the logit\nhazard function, an additional factorial ANOVA was conducted where RPB was entered as the dependent variable and each of the manipulated conditions, in addition to model type (i.e., DTS, ML-DTS, and CC-DTS models), were entered as independent variables for each parameter in the hazard function. By including model type as an independent variable, the factorial ANOVA reveals model differences above and beyond differences observed for the other manipulated conditions, and therefore, may result in different practically important effects of the manipulated conditions on the observed RPB. Appendix E presents the results of all factorial ANOVAs when model type was included as a factor along with each of the manipulated conditions. The results indicated that for a1, the interaction of the between-cluster variance component and model type had a practically significant effect on the RPB [F(2, 215,784) = 13,905.54, p < .001, gC\" = 0.114], where the mean RPB was more negative when the variance between-clusters was 1.09 for both the DTS and the ML-DTS models (MDTS = \u22120.17, MML-DTS = \u22120.05) than when it was 0.32 (MDTS = \u22120.06, MML-DTS = \u22120.02), but was identical for the CC-DTS model regardless of the variancebetween clusters condition (M0.32 = 0.00, M1.09= 0.00). Similar results were observed for a2, where the interaction of the between-cluster variance component and model type had a practically significant effect on the RPB [F(2, 215,784) = 5,524.54, p < .001, gC\" = 0.049], where the mean RPB was more negative when the variance between-clusters was 1.09 for both the DTS and the ML-DTS models (MDTS = \u22120.13, MML-DTS = \u22120.05) than when it was 0.32 (MDTS = \u22120.06, MML-DTS = \u22120.02), but was identical for the CC-DTS model regardless of the variance-between clusters condition (M0.32 = 0.00, M1.09= 0.00). Again, similar results were observed for a3. Here,\n97\nthe interaction of the between-cluster variance component and model type had a practically significant effect on the RPB [F(2, 215,784) = 1,330.79, p < .001, gC\" = 0.012], where the mean RPB was more negative when the variance between-clusters was 1.09 for both the DTS and the ML-DTS models (MDTS = \u22120.08, MML-DTS = \u22120.05) than when it was 0.32 (MDTS = \u22120.04, MMLDTS = \u22120.02), but was identical for the CC-DTS model regardless of the variance-between clusters condition (M0.32 = 0.00, M1.09= 0.00). For a4, the interaction of the Weibull scale parameter and model type had a practically significant effect on the RPB [F(2, 215,784) = 2,673.92, p < .001, gC\" = 0.024], where the mean RPB was more negative when the Weibull scale parameter was equal to 0.025 than when it was equal to 0.05 for the DTS model (M.025 = \u22120.05, M.05 = 0.00), but was nearly identical regardless of the Weibull scale parameter for both the MLDTS (M.025 = \u22120.02, M.05 = \u22120.02) and CC-DTS models (M.025 = 0.00, M.05 = 0.00). For a5, a three-way interaction between model type, Weibull scale parameter, and variance betweenclusters was found to have a practically significant effect on the RPB [F(2, 215,784) = 1,242.52, p < .001, gC\" = 0.011]. Table 16 presents the mean RPB values by condition and model for this three-way interaction effect. For the CC-DTS model, no RPB was observed regardless of the level of the variance between-clusters or the Weibull scale parameter condition. However, for the DTS model, the mean RPB was identical for each level of the variance between-clusters condition when the Weibull scale parameter was 0.025, but was much more positive when the variance between-clusters was equal to 1.09 than when it was 0.32 when the Weibull scale parameter was 0.05. For the ML-DTS model, slight differences in RPB were observed between levels of the variance between-clusters condition when the Weibull scale parameter was 0.025, but no RPB was observed regardless of the level of the variance between-clusters condition when the Weibull scale parameter was 0.05.\n98\nNote. Italicized and bolded values indicate moderate or substantial relative parameter bias.

Moderate or substantial bias was present under all combinations of conditions using the DTS model. When the between-clusters variance was 0.32, the coefficient was estimated with negative bias of a magnitude ranging from about 0.057 to as high as 0.074, indicating moderate bias. When the between-clusters variance was 1.09, substantial negative bias was observed, ranging from \u22120.182 to \u22120.206. For the ML-DTS model, relative parameter bias was moderate for 6 out of 36 combinations of conditions. In all cases, relative parameter bias was present when the variance between-clusters was 1.09 and the mobility rate condition was 30%. The coefficient for the levelone predictor was estimated with negative bias of a magnitude from 0.053 to 0.068 for the MLDTS model. For the CC-DTS model, no moderate or substantial RPB was observed in any combination of conditions.\n100\nTable 18 presents the relative parameter bias for the level-1 predictor\u2019s coefficient, @!,\nfor the DTS, ML-DTS, and CC-DTS models, respectively, for the 36 unique combinations of conditions that included a Weibull scale parameter that was equal to 0.05. Moderate or substantial bias was present under all combinations of conditions using the DTS model. When the between-clusters variance was 0.32, moderate negative bias was observed; however, when the between-clusters variance was 1.09, substantial negative bias was observed, ranging from about \u22120.22 to \u22120.25. For the ML-DTS model, relative parameter bias was moderate for 8 out of 36 combinations of conditions. For the majority of conditions where RPB was present, moderate RPB was observed when the variance between-clusters was 1.09 and the mobility rate condition was 30%. In one instance, the mobility rate condition was 20% in combination with a variance between-clusters of 1.09, a cluster-size of 100, and a within-cluster size of 75. For the CC-DTS model, no moderate or substantial RPB was observed in any combination of conditions.\n102\nTo further explore the results presented in Tables 17 and 18, a factorial ANOVA was\nconducted for each model, the DTS, ML-DTS, and CC-DTS models, respectively, where RPB was the dependent variable. Appendix D presents the partial eta-squared estimates for each estimating model for the coefficient of the level-one predictor. The ANOVA results indicated that the main effect of the variance between-clusters had a practically significant effect on RPB for the coefficient of @! for the DTS model [F(1, 71,928) = 14,163.86, p < .001, gC\" = 0.165]. For the DTS model, the mean of the RPB estimates was much more negative for conditions where the variance between-clusters was 1.09 than when the variance between-clusters was 0.32 (M0.32 = \u22120.08, M1.09 = \u22120.21). For the DTS model, the main effect of the Weibull scale parameter was also found to be practically significant [F(1, 71,928) = 867.03, p < .001, gC\" = 0.012]. When the Weibull scale parameter was 0.05, the average RPB across all conditions was more negative than when it was 0.025 (M.025 = \u22120.13, M.05 = \u22120.16). No practically significant differences in RPB based on the main effects or interactions between the five independent variables were found for either the ML-DTS or the CC-DTS for the coefficient of the level-1 predictor variable.\nAn additional factorial ANOVA was conducted where RPB was entered as the dependent\nvariable and each of the manipulated conditions, as well as model type (i.e., DTS, ML-DTS, and CC-DTS models), were entered as independent variables. Appendix E presents the results of all factorial ANOVAs when model type is included as a factor along with each of the manipulated conditions. The results indicated that for the coefficient of the level-one predictor, the interaction of the between-cluster variance component and model type had a practically significant effect on the RPB [F(2, 215,784) = 3,816.38, p < .001, gC\" = 0.034], where the mean RPB was much more negative when the variance between-clusters was 1.09 for the DTS model (M0.32 = \u22120.08, M1.09 = \u22120.21), with only a slight difference between levels of the variance between-clusters condition\n103\nfor the ML-DTS model (M0.32 = \u22120.02, M1.09 = \u22120.04). In contrast, no difference was observed for the CC-DTS model regardless of the level of the variance-between clusters condition (M0.32 = 0.00, M1.09= 0.00). Coefficient of the cluster-level predictor, iL\nTable 19 presents the relative parameter bias for the level-2 predictor\u2019s coefficient, @\",\nfor the DTS, ML-DTS, and CC-DTS models, respectively, for the 36 unique combinations of conditions that included a Weibull scale parameter that was equal to 0.025. For both the DTS model and the ML-DTS model, the coefficient for the level-2 predictor exhibited moderate or substantial RPB under all combinations of conditions. For the DTS model, substantial negative RPB was observed for all 36 combinations of conditions. When holding all other conditions constant, RPB became more negative as mobility increased in the dataset. Additionally, holding other conditions constant, RPB was greater when the variance between-clusters was 1.09 as compared to when it was 0.32. Specifically, when the variance between-clusters was 0.32, bias ranged from \u22120.12 to \u22120.29. When the variance between-clusters was 1.09, the coefficient estimate was more substantially negative, ranging from about \u22120.24 to as \u22120.40. For the ML-DTS, although both moderate and substantial RPB was observed, it was notably less substantial than for the DTS model. Holding all other conditions constant, RPB became more negative as mobility increased. However, RPB was not as greatly affected by the variance between-clusters for the ML-DTS model as it was using the DTS model. For the CC-DTS model, no substantial RPB was observed for any combination of conditions.\n105\nTable 20 presents the relative parameter bias for the level-2 predictor\u2019s coefficient, @\",\nfor the DTS, ML-DTS, and CC-DTS models, respectively, for the 36 unique combinations of conditions that included a Weibull scale parameter that was equal to 0.05. For both the DTS model and the ML-DTS model, the coefficient for the level-2 predictor exhibited moderate or substantial RPB for all 36 combinations of conditions. For the DTS model, when holding all other conditions constant, RPB became became more negative as mobility increased in the dataset. Additionally, holding other conditions constant, RPB was greater when the variance between-clusters was 1.09 as compared to when it was 0.32. Specifically, when the variance between-clusters was 0.32, bias ranged from \u22120.13 to \u22120.29. When the variance between-clusters was 1.09, the coefficient estimate was more substantially negative, ranging from about \u22120.25 to \u22120.40. For the ML-DTS model, although both moderate and substantial RPB was observed, it was notably less substantial than for the DTS model. Holding all other conditions constant, RPB became more negative as mobility increased. RPB of the estimate using the ML-DTS model ranged from \u22120.05 under the 10% mobility condition to as much as \u22120.27 under the 30% mobility condition. For the CC-DTS model, no substantial RPB was observed for any combination of conditions.\n107\nTo further explore the results presented in Tables 19 and 20, a factorial ANOVA was\nconducted for each model, the DTS, ML-DTS, and CC-DTS models, respectively, where RPB was the dependent variable and the simulation conditions were entered as the independent variables. Appendix D presents the partial eta-squared estimates for each estimating model for the coefficient of the level-two predictor. The ANOVA results indicated that the main effect of the variance between-clusters had a practically significant effect on RPB for the coefficient of @\" for the DTS model [F(1, 71,928) = 1,452.62, p < .001, gC\" = 0.020]. Specifically, the mean of the RPB estimates was more negative for conditions where the variance between-clusters was 1.09 than when the variance between-clusters was 0.32 (M0.32 = \u22120.21, M1.09 = \u22120.33). The rate of mobility in the dataset also had a practically significant effect on the RPB of the parameter using the DTS model [F(2, 71,928) = 432.89, p < .001, gC\" = 0.012]. When RPB was examined for datasets specific to each mobility rate, it was apparent that as the rate of mobility increased in the dataset, the mean RPB became increasingly more negative (M.10 = \u2212.21, M.20= \u2212.27, M.30= \u2212.33). For the ML-DTS model, the rate of mobility also had a practically significant effect on the RPB [F(2, 71,928) = 597.08, p < .001, gC\" = 0.016]. As was observed for the DTS model, as the rate of mobility in the dataset increased, the RPB became more negative (M.10 = \u2212.09, M.20= \u2212.17, M.30= \u2212.24). There was no practically significant effect of simulation condition on the RPB observed for the CC-DTS model.\nGiven the differences in RPB observed between models, an additional factorial ANOVA\nwas conducted where RPB was entered as the dependent variable and each of the manipulated conditions, as well as model type (i.e., DTS, ML-DTS, and CC-DTS models), were entered as independent variables. Appendix E presents the results of all factorial ANOVAs when model type is included as a factor along with each of the manipulated conditions. The results indicate\n108\nthat for the coefficient of the level-two predictor, only the main effect of model type had a practically significant effect on the RPB [F(2, 215,784) = 5,603.90, p < .001, gC\" = 0.049], where, on average, the DTS model and the ML-DTS model resulted in substantial negative bias for the coefficient of the level-2 predictor (MDTS = \u22120.27, MML-DTS = \u22120.17). In contrast, on average, the CC-DTS resulted in no substantial RPB for the coefficient of the level-2 predictor (MCC-DTS = 0.00). Between-Clusters Variance, jPL\nTable 21 presents the relative parameter bias for the between-clusters variance\ncomponent, L1\", for the ML-DTS and CC-DTS models, respectively, for the 36 unique combinations of conditions that included a Weibull scale parameter that was equal to 0.025. For the ML-DTS model, the coefficient for the level-2 predictor exhibited substantial RPB in datasets generated using all 36 combinations of conditions presented. Holding all other conditions constant, RPB generally became less substantial as the cluster size increased. Additionally, when all other conditions were held constant, RPB became more substantial as the rate of mobility in the generated datasets increased. Therefore, in datasets generated with a small cluster size (i.e., 30) and high mobility (i.e., 30%), substantial negative bias was observed, ranging from \u22120.45 to \u22120.48. For datasets generated with a large cluster size (i.e., 100) and a low rate of mobility (i.e., 10%), bias was still negative, but to a lesser extent, ranging from about \u22120.18 to \u22120.22. For the CC-DTS model, moderate RPB was observed in 15 out of the 36 conditions, while substantial RPB was observed in 2 out of the 36 conditions. RPB appeared to become more substantial as the cluster-level sample size decreased. Specifically, the RPB indicated that unacceptable negative bias was present in all combinations of conditions that included a cluster-level sample size of 30. In some combinations of conditions that included a\n109\nbetween-clusters variance of 0.32 and lower mobility rates, unacceptable RPB was also observed when the cluster size was 50. Although in these cases RPB was still considered to be outside of the acceptable range of \u22120.05 to 0.05, it was always less substantial than when using the MLDTS model. For those two cases that had substantial RPB beyond a magnitude of 0.10 for the CC-DTS model, both included a low cluster size and low within-cluster sample size, and the magnitude of the RPB was about 0.11.\n111\nTable 22 presents the relative parameter bias for the between-clusters variance\ncomponent, L1\", for the ML-DTS and CC-DTS models, respectively, for the 36 unique combinations of conditions that included a Weibull scale parameter that was equal to 0.05. Similar to results observed when the Weibull scale parameter was 0.025, substantial RPB was observed for all 36 combinations of conditions using the ML-DTS model. RPB was most substantial as cluster size decreased and the rate of mobility in the dataset increased. Substantial negative bias ranged from \u22120.16 when the cluster size was 100 under the 10% mobility rate condition to \u22120.45 when the cluster size was 30 under the 30% mobility rate condition. Similar to the results presented in Table 21, the use of the CC-DTS model resulted in moderate RPB for all combinations of conditions that included a cluster-level sample size of 30. When the betweenclusters variance was equal to 0.32 under the 20% mobility condition, there was also moderate RPB observed when the cluster size was 50. Although unacceptable RPB was observed, it was always less substantial than when the ML-DTS was used to estimate the between-clusters variance.\n113\nTo further explore the results presented in Tables 21 and 22, a factorial ANOVA was\nconducted for each model, the ML-DTS and CC-DTS models, respectively, where RPB was the dependent variable and the simulation conditions were the independent variables. Appendix D presents the partial eta-squared estimates for each estimating model. The ANOVA results indicated that the main effect of the mobility rate in the dataset had a practically significant effect on RPB for L1\" using the ML-DTS model [F(2, 71,928) = 8,217.77, p < .001, gC\" = 0.186]. When the average RPB was calculated across all conditions for each mobility rate, it was apparent that RPB became consistently more negative as the rate of mobility in the dataset increased (M.10 = \u2212.21, M.20 = \u2212.34, M.30 = \u2212.43). Additionally, there was a practically significant effect of the main effect of cluster size on the RPB using the ML-DTS model [F(2, 71,928) = 359.57, p < .001, gC\" = 0.010]. Specifically, as cluster size increased, the average RPB decreased (M30 = \u2212.35, M50 = \u22120.32, M100 = \u2212.30). For the CC-DTS model, no simulation condition was found to have a practically significant effect on RPB. Although the results presented in Tables 21 and 22 indicate moderate or substantial RPB when the cluster size was 30 and no RPB in any conditions that included a cluster size of 100, the relatively low magnitude of RPB (< 0.10) for the majority of combinations of conditions is likely why no practical effect was observed.\nGiven that unacceptable RPB was observed in both the ML-DTS and CC-DTS models\nfor some or all combinations of conditions, an additional factorial ANOVA was conducted where RPB was entered as the dependent variable and each of the manipulated conditions, as well as model type (i.e., ML-DTS and CC-DTS models), were entered as independent variables. Appendix E presents the results of all factorial ANOVAs when model type is included as a factor along with each of the manipulated conditions. The results indicated that the interaction of mobility and model type had a practically significant effect on the RPB [F(2, 215,784) =\n114\n3,195.48, p < .001, gC\" = 0.043]. Specifically, the ML-DTS model consistently resulted in substantial RPB that became more negative as mobility in the dataset increased (M.10 = \u22120.21, M.20 = \u22120.34, M.30 = \u22120.43). In contrast, when averaging across all other manipulated conditions, the CC-DTS model resulted in the same RPB regardless of the mobility condition (M.10 = \u22120.05, M.20 = \u22120.05, M.30 = \u22120.05)."

For the DTS model, when all else was equal, the RMSE was substantially lower when the between-clusters variance was 0.32. To a lesser extent, RMSE appeared to be affected by both the cluster size and within-cluster sample size, such that in both cases, larger sample sizes resulted in lower RMSE values. Lastly, holding all other simulation conditions constant, the RMSE increased slightly as the rate of mobility in the dataset increased. For the ML-DTS model, the RMSE consistently decreased with increasing sample size, with larger cluster-level sample sizes resulting in notably lower values of the RMSE. Additionally, holding all other conditions constant, when the variance between clusters was 1.09, the RMSE was greater than when it was 0.32.

Conversely, the CC-DTS model resulted in acceptable coverage rates for all but two of the 36 combinations of conditions. However, for the two combinations of conditions that resulted in unacceptable coverage, the coverage rates were only very slightly below the .925 threshold, with both resulting in coverage rates greater than .910.\n158\nTo further explore the results presented in Tables 41 and 42, a logistic regression was\nconducted for each model, the DTS, ML-DTS, and CC-DTS models, respectively, where the dependent variable was binary and represented whether or not the confidence interval included the true value of the parameter and the simulation conditions were entered as the independent variables. The Cox Effect was recorded for each model parameter and is presented in Appendix I. For the DTS model, multiple nested logistic regression models were conducted to assess model fit, and it was determined that compared to a model with higher-order interactions, the model with third-order interactions produced the best model fit, [k\"(16) = 8.95, p = 0.92]. The results indicated a practically important interaction between cluster size (dummy variable contrasting a cluster size of 100 to a cluster size of 30), variance between clusters, and Weibull scale parameter, [k\"(71,948) = 6.05, p < .05, FDEF= 0.45]. When the cluster size was 30, the coverage rate was always greater than when it was 100 when examined in combination with the variance between clusters and Weibull scale parameter. For example, when the cluster size was 30, the variance between clusters was 0.32, and the Weibull scale parameter was 0.025, the coverage rate was greater than when the cluster size was 100, the variance between clusters was 0.032, and the Weibull scale parameter was 0.025 (mGnaD+Eooooooooooo30,0.32,.025 = .666, mGnaD+Eooooooooooo100,0.32,.025 = .379). Additionally, the coverage was always greater when the variance between clusters was 0.32 than when it was 1.09. When the cluster size was 100 and the Weibull scale parameter was 0.05, the coverage was greater than when the Weibull scale parameter was 0.025 regardless of the value of the variance between clusters; however, when the cluster size was 30, coverage was greater when the Weibull scale parameter was 0.025 than when it was 0.05 if the variance between clusters was 0.32, but coverage was greater when the Weibull scale parameter was 0.05 if the variance between clusters was 1.09. The main effect of the within-cluster sample size was also practically\n159\nsignificant, [k\"(71,948) = \u221214.16, p < .05, FDEF= \u22120.67], such that the coverage rate was greater when the within-cluster sample size was 25 than when it was 75 (mGnaD+Eooooooooooo = .458, mGnaD+Eooooooooooo = .258). The main effect of the cluster size (dummy variable contrasting a cluster size of 50 to a cluster size of 30) was also practically important, [k\"(71,948) = \u22124.92, p < .05, FDEF= \u22120.25], such that coverage was greater when the cluster size was 30 than when it was 50 (mGnaD+Eooooooooooo = .478, mGnaD+Eooooooooooo = .377). For the ML-DTS model, multiple nested logistic regression models were conducted to assess model fit, and it was determined that compared to a model with higher-order interactions, the model with second-order interactions produced the best model fit, [k\"(25) = 24.12, p = 0.51]. A practically important interaction was observed between mobility rate (dummy variable contrasting the 30% mobility rate condition with the 10% mobility rate condition) and cluster size (dummy variable contrasting a cluster size of 100 to a cluster size of 30), [k\"(71,973) = \u22128.50, p < .05, FDEF= \u22120.35]. When the mobility rate condition was 10%, the coverage rate was very similar regardless of cluster size (mGnaD+Eooooooooooo30 = .916, mGnaD+Eooooooooooo100 = .883). Conversely, when the mobility rate condition was 30%, coverage was greater when the cluster size was 30 than when it was 100 (mGnaD+Eooooooooooo30 = .821, mGnaD+Eooooooooooo100 = .693). Additionally, a practically important interaction was found between mobility rate (dummy variable contrasting the 30% mobility rate condition with the 10% mobility rate condition) and within-cluster sample size, [k\"(71,973) = \u22127.58, p < .05, FDEF= \u22120.26]. Specifically, when the mobility rate condition was 10%, the average coverage was very similar regardless of the within-cluster sample size (mGnaD+Eooooooooooo25 = .913, mGnaD+Eooooooooooo75 = .907). When the mobility rate condition was 30%, the coverage rate was greater when the within-cluster sample size was 25 than when it was 75 (mGnaD+Eooooooooooo25 = .815, mGnaD+Eooooooooooo75 = .734). For the CC-DTS model, no main effect or interaction between the\n160\nindependent variables was found to have a practically significant effect on the coverage of the 95% confidence intervals."

The Cox Effect was recorded for model parameter, and is presented in Appendix I. For the DTS model, multiple nested logistic regression models were conducted to assess model fit, and it was determined that compared to a model with higherorder interactions, the model with fourth-order interactions produced the best model fit, [k\"(4) = 2.92, p = 0.57]. The results indicated a practically important interaction between cluster size (dummy variable contrasting a cluster size of 100 to a cluster size of 30), mobility rate (dummy variable contrasting the 30% mobility condition and 10% mobility condition), the within-cluster sample size, and the variance between clusters, [k\"(71,932) = 3.32, p < .05, FDEF= 0.55]. Regardless of the other combinations of conditions, coverage was lowest when the variance between clusters was 1.09. Coverage was also lower when the cluster size and within-cluster sample sizes were greater. Additionally, the results indicated a practically important interaction between cluster size (dummy variable contrasting a cluster size of 100 to a cluster size of 30), the within-cluster sample size, the variance between clusters, and the Weibull scale parameter [k\"(71,932) = \u22122.69, p < .05, FDEF= \u22120.36]. As the cluster size and within-cluster sample size increased, the coverage decreased, regardless of the other conditions. Additionally, when the between clusters variance was 1.09 and the Weibull scale parameter was 0.05, coverage rates were always lower. However, the difference in the coverage rates by Weibull scale parameter became greater when the variance between clusters was 1.09 as compared to when it was 0.32, and increased as both the within-cluster and cluster size increased. Lastly, a practically important\n183\ninteraction was observed between cluster size (dummy variable contrasting a cluster size of 50 to a cluster size of 30), the within-cluster sample size, and the mobility rate (dummy variable contrasting the 30% mobility condition and 10% mobility condition), [k\"(71,932) = \u22122.02, p <\n.05, FDEF= \u22120.32]. The largest difference in coverage occurred due to the within-cluster sample size, such that regardless of the other variables in the interaction, coverage decreased substantially as within-cluster sample size increased. For example, when the mobility rate condition was 10% and the cluster size was 30, the coverage rate was greater when the withincluster sample size was 25 than when it was 75 (mGnaD+Eooooooooooo25 = .878, mGnaD+Eooooooooooo75 = .738). This pattern occurred regardless of mobility rate or cluster size, although when cluster size was greater, the difference in coverage rates by within-cluster sample size also increased. For the ML-DTS model, multiple nested logistic regression models were conducted to assess model fit, and it was determined that compared to a model with higher-order interactions, the model with third-order interactions produced the best model fit, [k\"(16) = 12.17, p = 0.73]. The results indicated a practically significant interaction between mobility rate (dummy variable contrasting the 30% mobility condition and the 10% mobility condition), cluster size (dummy variable contrasting a cluster size of 100 to a cluster size of 30), and within-cluster sample size, [k\"(71,948) = \u22122.72, p < .05, FDEF= \u22120.30]. When the mobility rate condition was 10%, the coverage rates were nearly equal regardless of the cluster size or within-cluster sample size. When the mobility rate condition was 30%, coverage was again nearly equal regardless of the within-cluster sample size when the cluster size was 30; however, when the cluster size was 100, coverage was slightly lower when the within-cluster sample size was 75 than when it was 25 (mGnaD+Eooooooooooo30%,100,25 = .931, mGnaD+Eooooooooooo30%,100,75 = .890). For the CC-DTS model, no main effect or\n184\ninteraction between the independent variables was found to have a practically significant effect on the coverage of the 95% confidence intervals."

In addition, it examines how the baseline hazard function, variability of the cluster random effect, mobility rate, and within- and between-cluster sample size impact the performance of a cross-classified discrete-time survival model. This simulation study includes datasets generated from 72 combinations of conditions by manipulating the within-cluster sample size (25 and 75), the cluster size (30, 50, 100), the between-cluster variance (0.32 and 1.09), the Weibull scale parameter (0.025 and 0.05), and the rate of individual mobility across clusters (10%, 20%, and 30%). The data generating model in this study is a cross-classified discrete-time survival model, and therefore, the CC-DTS estimating model most closely matches the data generating procedures. Model performance is assessed by examining the relative parameter bias, root mean square error, and coverage of the 95% confidence intervals for the DTS, ML-DTS, and CC-DTS models across 1,000 replications of each of the 72 unique combinations of conditions. This chapter will discuss the results of this simulation study, serving to compare and contrast the performance of each of the three models included in this simulation study. Additionally, it contains a discussion of the limitations of the current study and suggestions for future research, and lastly, the importance of the study for empirical researchers."

            "text": "This study investigates the performance of three discrete-time survival models in the\npresence of a cross-classified data structure that is a result of the specific situation that occurs when individuals are mobile across clusters. As such, when examining the impact of mobility on the model parameters, it is important to understand how the data generating procedures affected the specification of mobility in the dataset. Recall that discrete-time survival analysis utilizes a person-period dataset, where the risk set during each discrete-time period changes because individuals are removed from the dataset following event occurrence. Due to the person-period data format, the specified percentage of mobile individuals (10%, 20%, and 30%) does not exactly match the actual mobility present in the generated datasets. Additionally, the Weibull scale parameter condition affects event occurrence, and therefore, the proportion of individuals removed from the dataset. Table 53 presents the average overall mobility rates across the generated datasets by Weibull scale parameter. Note that the actual mobility rates are lower than the specified mobility rates due to the changing risk set. Therefore, for the remainder of this discussion, the mobility condition will be referred to as \u201clow\u201d, \u201cmedium\u201d, and \u201chigh\u201d levels of mobility.\n192\nNote. Actual overall mobility rates represent the proportion of individuals in the dataset that actually moved during the time period of study. The Hazard Function\nIn discrete-time survival analysis, the hazard function is represented by a coefficient\nestimate, known as the intercept, for each discrete-time period to examine the likelihood of event occurrence in each discrete-time period of study. The findings indicate that the DTS model clearly has difficulty estimating the parameters representing the hazard function regardless of the combination of conditions present as compared to either the ML-DTS or the CC-DTS models. For instance, in regards to RPB, the DTS model yields moderately or substantially biased estimates for the majority of parameters representing the hazard function, regardless of the combination of simulation conditions. Indeed, the ANOVA results suggest important impacts of the Weibull scale parameter, the variance between clusters, and in some cases, mobility, on RPB for parameters representing the hazard function using the DTS model. A larger variance between-clusters, and in some cases, greater rates of mobility, result in more substantially negative RPB for the DTS model. The Weibull scale parameter sometimes interacts with the variance between-clusters, resulting in differing impacts of the Weibull scale parameter on RPB depending on the level of the variance between-clusters condition. In regards to RMSE, the\n193\nwithin-cluster sample size plays a very important role in determining the magnitude of RMSE for the parameters representing the hazard function for the DTS model. For instance, holding all other conditions constant, the RMSE value is consistently lower when the within-cluster sample size is 75 than when it is 25. Generally, as the sample size in the dataset increases, RMSE for the DTS model decreases. Additionally, the variance between clusters consistently has a large impact on RMSE for the DTS model, where RMSE is much greater when it is 1.09 than when it is 0.32. In regard to coverage of the 95% CIs, the DTS model performs poorly for all parameters of the hazard function, never falling within the acceptable range. In almost all combinations of conditions, it performs worse than either the ML-DTS or the CC-DTS models. Indeed, the cluster size, within-cluster sample size, and variance between-clusters consistently have practically important impacts on coverage of the 95% CIs for parameters representing the hazard function for the DTS model, such that the 95% CI includes the true parameter value more often in datasets that include a lower sample size and/or a lower variance between clusters.\nThe performance of the ML-DTS model, in terms of RPB and coverage of the 95% CIs,\nis often superior to the DTS model. For instance, the ML-DTS model results in acceptable RPB for many combinations of simulation conditions. However, mobility and the variance between clusters has a clear impact on RPB for the parameters representing the hazard function for the ML-DTS model. In most cases, when the variance between clusters is 0.32, the ML-DTS model exhibits acceptable RPB, even when mobility increases. However, when the variance between clusters increases to 1.09, the magnitude of RPB for most parameters representing the hazard function becomes more substantially negative as the rate of mobility in the dataset increases, especially for medium and high rates of mobility. When unacceptable RPB is present, it is always moderate, or between a magnitude 0.05 and 0.10. Indeed, the results of the ANOVAs\n194\nindicate that the main effects of both the degree of mobility and the amount of variance betweenclusters have a practically important impact on the RPB for the parameters representing the hazard function for the ML-DTS model. Specifically, when the variance between-clusters or mobility increases in the dataset, RPB becomes more substantially negative. RMSE for the MLDTS model is highly influenced by both the variance between clusters and mobility. Specifically, holding all other manipulated conditions constant, as mobility increases, the RMSE tends to increase. This is especially true when the variance between clusters is 1.09, where the RMSE values overall are larger than when it is 0.32. Comparing across models, when the variance between-clusters is 0.32 and mobility is low, the RMSE estimates for each parameter of the hazard function produced by the ML-DTS model and the CC-DTS model are nearly equal. Given that under these same conditions RPB is also similar between the ML-DTS model and the CCDTS model, the RMSE results suggest that both models offer similar precision when estimating parameters representing the hazard function in datasets with low mobility rates and low betweencluster variance. In regard to coverage of the 95% CIs, the ML-DTS model results in undercoverage of most parameters representing the hazard function when mobility is medium or high, regardless of other combinations of conditions. This observation is further supported by the results of the logistic regressions, which indicate that coverage for the coefficients representing the hazard function using the ML-DTS model are most often affected by the mobility rate and cluster size in the generated datasets. However, overall, coverage is substantially better using the ML-DTS model than the DTS model under all combinations of conditions.\nAs compared to the DTS and ML-DTS models, the CC-DTS model estimates the\ncoefficients representing the hazard function well. In all cases, RPB is clearly within the acceptable range, indicating virtually no bias (i.e., RPB was close to 0). Additionally, coverage\n195\nof the 95% CIs is well within the acceptable range for all combinations of conditions using the CC-DTS model, and the results of the logistic regressions indicate no practical impact of any simulation condition on coverage of the 95% CIs. Given that the ML-DTS and CC-DTS models result in no substantial RPB when the variance between clusters is 0.32 for any parameter representing the hazard function, lower values of RMSE suggest greater precision of the estimates. As such, RMSE values indicate that most often, the CC-DTS offers greater precision in the estimates of the hazard function, especially as mobility increases, than the ML-DTS model.\nSimilar to the results found in a real data study by Lamote et al. (2013), the parameters\nrepresenting the hazard function differ between the three models examined here. The DTS model has very different estimates of the parameters representing the hazard function than the other models, with unacceptable RPB and extremely poor coverage of the 95% CIs. A smaller difference in estimates of the hazard function exists between the ML-DTS model and the CCDTS model, and while coverage of the 95% CIs is always found to be acceptable for the CCDTS model, the ML-DTS model results in unacceptable coverage commensurate with increasing mobility in the dataset. This suggests that as mobility increases in the dataset, the likelihood of committing a Type I error also increases if mobility is ignored by modeling only the impact of the first cluster (e.g., school) on the hazard function.\nPrevious research that compares a multilevel model that ignores mobility to a model that\naccounts for mobility across clusters has indicated that while bias may occur in some standard error estimates for coefficients at level-1, ignoring mobility does not impact intercept estimates (see for example, Cappelli et al., 2020; Chung & Beretvas, 2012; Leroux & Beretvas, 2018b; Leroux et al., 2020; Luo & Kwok, 2009, 2012; Meyers & Beretvas, 2006). However, it should be\n196\nexpected that these findings would not hold true in a discrete time survival model, likely as a result of the introduction of heterogeneity to the dataset due to individual mobility across clusters. Barber et al. (2000) and Masyn (2003) described the impact of violating the assumption of no unobserved heterogeneity in discrete-time survival models, stating that when heterogeneity in the data is ignored by the estimating model, the hazard function may be negatively impacted. Barber et al. (2000) specifically stated that in the presence of clustering, excluding a random effect at the clustering level will likely result in a biased hazard function, as is apparent in this study when using a DTS model, where the hazard function is clearly biased under nearly all simulation conditions. It is likely that the low coverage rates observed using the DTS model are the result of the substantial RPB in the intercept coefficients in combination with underestimated standard errors of the intercept coefficients. It is well known that ignoring the clustering level of a nested data structure by using a single-level model, such as the DTS model, results in underestimated standard errors (Fielding & Goldstein, 2006; Moerbeek, 2004; Raudenbush & Bryk, 2002). Clark (2008) assessed the performance of a single-level generalized linear model in the presence of a clustered data structure with a specific focus on the impact of within-cluster sample sizes, and found that standard errors were underestimated by up to 40%, with standard error bias increasing as the within-cluster sample size increased to 20 individuals per cluster. The results of this study broadly follow those found by Clark (2008), although due to the combination of mobility and larger within-cluster sample sizes, more extreme undercoverage of the 95% CIs is present using the DTS model. Lamote et al. (2013) also compared a CC-DTS model to a MLDTS model using real data, and found that the hazard functions estimated by the two models also differed. Therefore, it is likely that just as clustering results in heterogeneity in the dataset, ignoring individual mobility across clusters represents another source of possible heterogeneity.\n197\nIn this study, the results indicate that the ML-DTS model has some moderate RPB under some combinations of simulation conditions, especially when the variance between clusters is high and mobility in the dataset is medium to high. Therefore, in the presence of these conditions, the results suggest that the CC-DTS model better estimates the parameters representing the hazard function.\nImportantly, the data generating procedures employed in this study likely have an impact\non the magnitude of the bias present in the hazard function, especially as it pertains to the moderate RPB observed in the ML-DTS model, which accounts for the clustered data structure but not mobility of individuals across clusters. As an example, one way that heterogeneity is introduced into the generated datasets is through the binary level-2 covariate (Z), which is specified such that students in schools coded as 1 have a greater likelihood of event occurrence across the study period than students in schools coded as 0. Additionally, mobility has an impact on Z, such that the true value of Z changes for mobile students, which remains unmodeled when using the ML-DTS model because it only takes on the value assigned to the first school. In other words, the ML-DTS model ignores the heterogeneity introduced by the impact of student mobility on the true value of the level-2 covariate, which therefore impacts the risk of event occurrence across the study (i.e., the hazard function). Furthermore, the data generation procedures for Z specify that 30% of clusters are coded as 1, while 70% are coded as 0; therefore, mobile students are more likely to begin in and move to a school coded 0 than they are to be in a school coded 1. If this ratio is different, for example a 50/50 ratio, mobile students would be just as likely to move into a school coded as 1 as they would be to a school coded as 0. In such a situation, it is possible that lower rates of mobility may have greater impacts on bias in the hazard function estimated using the ML-DTS model than that observed in this study, since\n198\nthe true variability in Z would be greater in such datasets. As such, the results described here offer a note of caution when using an estimating model that ignores heterogeneity, which may result in more or less substantial bias of the hazard function given different data contexts."

            "text": "Results indicate that the coefficient of the individual-level predictor has substantial RPB\nacross all conditions using the DTS model, with bias becoming more substantially negative when the variance between clusters increases. This should be expected, as the DTS model does not account for the nested data structure, and therefore, violates the assumption of no unobserved heterogeneity due to clustering (Barber et al., 2000). Additionally, RPB is consistently more substantially negative for the DTS model when the Weibull scale parameter is 0.05. RMSE values are notably impacted by the within-cluster sample size, with RMSE values decreasing when the within-cluster sample size is 75 as opposed to when it is 25. Coverage of the 95% CIs most often indicates slight to substantial undercoverage using the DTS model. The results of the logistic regression indicate that the coverage rate is highly impacted by the variance between clusters and the within-cluster sample size. Specifically, coverage is extremely poor when the variance between clusters is 1.09, and generally, coverage decreases when the within-cluster sample is 75. Similar to the results observed for the hazard function, these low coverage rates are likely explained by an underestimation of the standard error for the level-1 coefficient estimate, which results in a narrowing of the 95% CIs. In combination with substantial RPB, this results in very low rates of coverage of the true parameter value. These results suggest that the DTS model consistently underestimates the individual-level coefficient, especially when the variance between clusters is high. Conversely, for the ML-DTS model, the coefficient of the individuallevel predictor is estimated without bias for the majority of simulation conditions; however, the\n199\nRPB results indicate that the coefficient is moderately underestimated when the variance between clusters is high in combination with high rates of mobility. For those same combinations of conditions, coverage of the 95% CIs is also unacceptable, with the greatest undercoverage of the coefficient for the level-1 predictor occurring when mobility is high. The results indicate that the CC-DTS model, in contrast to the ML-DTS model and especially the DTS model, estimates the individual-level coefficient without bias and with acceptable coverage of the 95% CIs under all combinations of simulation conditions.\nAgain, the moderate RPB and undercoverage of the 95% CIs present when mobility is\nignored is likely due to the impact of unmodeled heterogeneity. Importantly, previous findings in the literature for continuous and binary outcomes that examined the impact of ignoring crossclassified data structures using purely clustered multilevel models often found that there was no substantial impact of model misspecification on the individual-level fixed effect parameter estimates (see for example, Cappelli et al., 2020; Chung & Beretvas, 2012; Leroux & Beretvas, 2018b; Leroux et al., 2020; Luo & Kwok, 2009, 2012; Meyers & Beretvas, 2006). However, these findings should not be expected to remain true for a discrete-time survival model due to the additional assumption of no unobserved heterogeneity, a violation of which can negatively impact lower-level coefficient estimates and their standard errors (Barber et al., 2000; Masyn, 2003). In fact, the bias in the estimated coefficients for the level-1 covariate may occur even if the source for heterogeneity, which here is mobility across clusters, has no association with the covariate (Masyn, 2009). Specifically, for the ML-DTS model, medium to high mobility rates in combination with high variance between clusters appears to result in some RPB and undercoverage of the 95% CIs in the coefficient for the individual-level covariate. In contrast,\n200\nthe CC-DTS model estimates the coefficient for the level-1 covariate well, regardless of the combination of simulation conditions.\nLamote et al. (2013) is the only study that has compared the results of a cross-classified\ndiscrete-time survival model to a purely clustered discrete-time survival model, and reported that there was no substantial difference between the individual-level fixed effect estimates or their standard errors between the two models. Comparing their study results to the combination of conditions in this study that most closely match their data (i.e., 50 clusters, 75 individuals per cluster, a high mobility rate, variance between-clusters of 0.32, and Weibull scale parameter of 0.025), similar findings are apparent. Specifically, under these conditions, the magnitude of RPB is not found to be substantial for the ML-DTS or CC-DTS models, and the RMSE values and coverage of the 95% CIs are similar to those found using the CC-DTS model."

            "text": "The results indicate that the coefficient of the cluster-level predictor is estimated with\nsubstantial bias for both the DTS and ML-DTS models. For the DTS model, both mobility and the variance between clusters have a substantial negative impact on RPB and RMSE, and the within-cluster sample size has a large impact on coverage of the 95% CIs. When the DTS model is used, the cluster-level coefficient is substantially underestimated, especially as compared to the ML-DTS and CC-DTS models, for all combinations of conditions. Specifically, coverage rates of the 95% CIs are extremely low and substantial negative bias is present, indicating a higher likelihood of committing a Type I error. In comparison, the ML-DTS model performs better than the DTS model, but overall, is still poor as compared to the CC-DTS model, especially when there are high rates of mobility in the dataset. The ML-DTS model also results in moderate to substantial RPB for all combinations of conditions examined, although the\n201\nmagnitude of the bias is always less severe than when the DTS model is used. RPB indicates only moderate underestimation of the cluster-level coefficient when overall mobility in the dataset is low, and when holding all other manipulated conditions constant, there is a clear negative impact of increasing mobility on RPB, such that substantial RPB is apparent when mobility is medium or high. Like the DTS model, the ML-DTS model results in substantial underestimation of the coefficient estimate and a high likelihood of committing a Type I error, as evidenced by the undercoverage of the 95% CIs in almost any combination of conditions that includes medium or high rates of mobility. The results of the logistic regression further support this finding, indicating that mobility has a practically important impact on coverage rates for the ML-DTS model. As opposed to the DTS and ML-DTS models, the CC-DTS model does not have substantial RPB for any combination of conditions. When the variance between clusters is 1.09, RMSE using the CC-DTS model is clearly impacted by the cluster-level sample size, such that it becomes lower as cluster size increases. In regard to coverage rates of the 95% CIs, the CC-DTS model results in acceptable coverage for the majority of combinations of conditions, with the only exceptions occurring when the cluster size is 30. Taken as a whole, these results suggest that in order to confidently estimate the cluster-level coefficient using the CC-DTS model, a cluster size greater than 30 is required.\nThe results of this study are consistent with the findings of previous research in the cross-\nclassified and multiple membership literature, where model misspecification was found to have a negative impact on cluster-level coefficient estimates (e.g., Cappelli et al., 2020; Chung & Beretvas, 2012; Choi & Wilson, 2016; Grady & Beretvas, 2010; Leroux et al., 2020; Luo & Kwok, 2009, 2012; Meyers & Beretvas, 2006). In this study, it should also be expected that use of the ML-DTS or DTS models would lead to bias in the cluster-level coefficient. Note that the\n202\ndata generating model is a CC-DTS model, which allows for the value of the cluster level predictor, O(0), to change for mobile students, such that when a student changes schools, the school characteristic also changes accordingly. In contrast, the ML-DTS model is estimated using the characteristic of only the first school attended. Therefore, for mobile students, the value of Z in the ML-DTS model does not match the true value of Z, negatively impacting the estimated coefficient. As such, as mobility increases in the dataset, RPB of the cluster-level coefficient increases using the ML-DTS model, but does not impact RPB when the CC-DTS model is used. A similar mechanism of bias has been described in previous simulation studies that examined model performance in the presence of individual mobility across clusters, which found that models that ignore mobility by using only a single school result in different coefficient estimates for the cluster-level predictor (Cappelli et al., 2020; Chung & Beretvas, 2012; Leroux et al., 2020). In a real data study using discrete-time survival analysis, Lamote et al. (2013) observed a similar pattern in the coefficient estimates, where the parameter estimates associated with school characteristics were lower when only a single school was used to estimate the cluster-level coefficient. Between-Clusters Variance Component, jPL\nThe between-clusters variance component, \u03c3&\" , is only assessed for the ML-DTS and CC-\nDTS models. As a single-level model, the DTS model does not account for the variance between clusters by incorporating a random component. The results indicate that the ML-DTS model results in substantial RPB regardless of the combination of conditions examined in this study. It is apparent that the most obvious pattern of RPB is related to mobility in the dataset, such that as mobility increases, the magnitude of RPB becomes larger. The ANOVA results support this finding, and indicate that mobility has a substantive impact on RPB. To a lesser extent, cluster\n203\nsize also has an important impact on RPB, such that the magnitude of bias becomes less severe as cluster size increases. The results indicate that even when the rate of mobility in the dataset is low, there are important negative implications for the estimation of the between-clusters variance component when using the ML-DTS model. The RMSE results also indicate that mobility has important implications for the between-clusters variance component, such that RMSE increases as mobility increases. Although not apparent when assessing RPB, RMSE for the betweenclusters variance component is also clearly impacted by the amount of between-clusters variability, such that RMSE increases when variance between clusters is larger. For the CC-DTS model, the between-clusters variance component is consistently underestimated when the cluster size is 30, regardless of other combinations of simulation conditions. Additionally, especially when the variance between clusters is 0.32, RPB either approaches or slightly exceeds the magnitude of 0.05 threshold for moderate bias. In contrast to the ML-DTS model, RPB and RMSE under the CC-DTS model are not impacted by mobility. Instead, RMSE is again similarly impacted by both cluster size and variance between clusters.\nThese findings are supported by cross-sectional studies that examined the impact of\nmobility on multilevel models, which have found that ignoring mobility using a purely clustered multilevel model results in biased estimates of the cluster-level variance component (Chung & Beretvas, 2012; Wheelis, 2017; Wolff Smith & Beretvas, 2017). Additionally, methodological studies using longitudinal multilevel models have resulted in similar findings, although slightly larger cluster sizes, generally 50 or greater, were suggested when modeling mobility using a longitudinal cross-classified and/or multiple membership model to estimate cluster-level variance components without bias (Cappelli et al., 2020; Choi & Wilson, 2016; Grady, 2010; Leroux & Beretvas, 2018b; Leroux et al., 2020; Luo & Kwok, 2012). These results are also\n204\nsupported by the limited survival analysis literature. For example, Elghafghuf et al. (2014) used a cross-classified multiple membership Cox Model (i.e., a continuous-time, as opposed to discretetime, survival model), and found that in terms of RPB, the CCM Cox Model performed better when mobility was higher and when variance components were larger. Similar results are seen in this study. Although the difference in RPB is only very slight, when the variance between clusters is 1.09, there is no substantial bias using the CC-DTS model when the cluster size is 50 or more, as opposed to a slight underestimation of the variance component when the cluster size is 50 and the variance between-clusters is 0.32."

            "text": "Discrete-time survival analysis is commonly seen in the empirical literature across\nmultiple disciplines in the social and behavioral sciences, such as education, criminology, and public health. This study examines the performance of a discrete-time survival model, a multilevel discrete-time survival model, and a cross-classified discrete-time survival model in the presence of a cross-classified data structure specifically resulting from individual mobility across clusters generated by a CC-DTS model. The results of this study suggest that in the presence of cross-classified data structures, the use of a discrete-time survival model without a random component could potentially result in severe bias for any model parameter, even when the variance between-clusters is relatively low. Therefore, under the conditions investigated in this study, a discrete-time survival model without a random component may not be appropriate to make inferences regarding the hazard function or covariates included in the model.\nThe multilevel and cross-classified discrete-time survival models include a random\ncomponent at the clustering level, and therefore, account for the clustered data structure often present in datasets in the social or behavioral sciences. The primary difference between the\n205\nmodels is that the CC-DTS model is specified to account for impure clustering, which in this study specifically occurs due to individual mobility across clusters, while the ML-DTS model is specified for only pure clustering of individuals within clusters. If the interest of the research is in describing the conditional hazard function, the ML-DTS model may be a comparatively simpler alternative to the CC-DTS model when overall mobility in the dataset is less than 10% in combination with an ICC of .10. However, regardless of the other conditions examined in this simulation study, as mobility increases, coverage of the 95% CIs decreases when the ML-DTS model is used, suggesting that there could potentially be an increased risk of making a Type I error, and therefore, incorrect inferences. Importantly, the extent to which the data conditions produce heterogeneity needs to be carefully considered when choosing to use the ML-DTS model in the presence of mobility, such that data conditions that result in greater heterogeneity under the same rates of mobility in this study may produce more or less bias in parameter estimates when that heterogeneity remains unmodeled. As such, caution may be necessary when employing the ML-DTS model to understand the conditional hazard function. When mobility rates are greater than 10% under the conditions investigated in this simulation, the CC-DTS model is one approach of handling mobility that could be given consideration to estimate parameters representing the hazard function to reduce parameter bias and to ensure correct inferences. Although this study employed a limited range of sample size conditions, initial findings suggest that the combination of a cluster-level sample size of 30 and within-cluster sample size of 25 may be sufficient for estimation of the hazard function using either the MLDTS or CC-DTS models under the simulation conditions examined here. Note that the impact of sample size on these results may change when real-world conditions differ from those generated in this study. If the interest is to describe the impact of a level-1 covariate on the hazard function,\n206\nthe ML-DTS model and the CC-DTS model could both be considered when the ICC is .10, regardless of the proportion of mobile individuals in the dataset. A similar note of caution as described for the hazard function may also be considered here. In any case, when the ICC is .25 and the mobility rate in the dataset is greater than 10%, slight parameter bias may occur and there may be a greater likelihood of a Type I error if using the ML-DTS model. If the interest is in describing the effect of cluster-level covariates on the hazard odds of event occurrence, more caution may be necessary if using the ML-DTS model. Given the data conditions generated as a part of this simulation study, severe bias and unacceptable coverage of the 95% CIs may result when using the ML-DTS model, even when overall rates of individual mobility across clusters are less than 10% in the dataset. Although negative impacts are minimal when the cluster size is 30, the findings suggest that with data conditions that are similar to those present in this study, a minimum cluster size of 50 may be needed to accurately estimate the coefficient for a binary covariate at level 2. Lastly, if the interest is in accurately estimating the variance component at the cluster level and mobility is present in the dataset (regardless of the rate), the ML-DTS model may result in severe bias. However, to estimate the variance component without bias using the CC-DTS model under the conditions investigated in this simulation, a minimum sample size of more than 30 at the cluster level may be necessary, with increasing sample sizes at the cluster level and higher variance between clusters appearing to result in less biased estimates.\nThe results of this study have important implications for policy in the social and\nbehavioral sciences. Recent educational policy interests and the resulting funding from federal agencies such as the National Science Foundation have focused on creating effective teacher preparation programs that address issues such as teacher retention (e.g., the Robert Noyce Scholarship Program). In light of these interests, discrete-time survival analysis is an important\n207\nmethodological approach to consider in studies of teacher retention, and indeed, has commonly been used in empirical research to understand the timing and risk of teachers leaving the profession (e.g., Donaldson, 2016; Kelly, 2004). Therefore, it is important for educational researchers to understand the impact of ignoring a level of clustering in discrete-time survival analysis, and further, the impact of ignoring mobility among students or teachers, both of which could potentially lead researchers to make incorrect inferences regarding the effect of individualor cluster-level characteristics on the risk of event occurrence. Researchers using event-history outcomes should be especially cautious of ignoring clustering and/or mobility, regardless of whether the interest is in making inferences using parameters at the individual or clustering level. Empirical researchers are advised to take special care to understand the extent to which there is variance between clusters and mobility in their datasets if a discrete-time survival model is used to describe the timing and risk of event occurrence."

            "heading": "Limitations and Future Research",
            "text": "This study is the first exploration of the impact of ignoring individual mobility across\nclusters when modeling an event history outcome using discrete-time survival analysis. As the first exploration, the purpose is to establish some understanding of the performance of a DTS model, a ML-DTS model, and a CC-DTS model in the presence of mobility as generated by the CC-DTS model and other common data conditions in the social and behavioral sciences. However, there are some limitations to the current study that may be addressed in future research. One study limitation is that mobility is generated to represent the proportion of the sample to be mobile. In other words, every sample dataset generated using the 10% mobility condition was initially generated to have 10% of individuals mobile across clusters. This procedure was used in all previous studies examining mobility, and was therefore adopted here\n208\nto maintain comparability. However, mobility could also be generated to be a proportion of the population, such that mobility across all datasets with the 10% mobility condition are generated to have an average of 10% mobility. Additionally, future studies may adjust the ratios of 0\u2019s and 1\u2019s in binary covariates to examine how balanced and unbalanced binary covariates may impact the results described in this study when covariate values change as a result of mobility, or add continuous covariates to the dataset. Future studies may also consider adding more than one covariate at each level of the multilevel models, and consider more complex relationships between covariates (e.g., within- and cross-level interactions).\nAnother limitation of this study pertains to the generation of event occurrence.\nSpecifically, the hazard function used in this study was generated using a two-parameter Weibull function, but the analytic model leaves the hazard function unstructured. This may result in an over-identification of the model, which may introduce some slight decrease in the precision of model estimates. Although the decrease in precision should affect all models compared in this study, and therefore should not impact the substantive results, a future study should consider editing the data generation procedures to be an exact match to the analytic model explored.\nAs an initial exploration into the performance of discrete-time survival models when\nindividual mobility across clusters is present in the data, this study only manipulates conditions hypothesized to likely have an important impact on model estimates based on previous research. However, there are other conditions that future research should explore to further understand how they impact the estimates from a discrete-time survival analysis. Future research may consider the impact of more extreme survival functions on parameter estimates. For example, if survival is so high at the end of the study that hazard is extremely low in certain time periods, it would be interesting to assess at what point the lack of variability in event occurrence within-\n209\nclusters impacts the parameter estimates. In educational research, it is quite common to have extremely low overall event occurrence on the order of 10% to 15%, and therefore, high survival at the end of the study (e.g., Davoudazadeh et al. (2015); Lamote et al. (2013)). In this study, the lowest overall event occurrence was about 27%, meaning that about 72% of the generated sample survived through the end of the study.\nOther additional conditions that future research may consider, and are specific to event\nhistory models, include the impact of manipulating the survival pattern (i.e., increasing, decreasing, and constant hazard across time), varying the widths of measurement occasions (i.e., the time between one observation and the next is not constant across individuals), or including interval-censored (missing) data in the datasets. While each of these have been explored and rarely impact parameter estimates (e.g., Moerbeek, 2012; Moerbeek & Hesen, 2018), when mobility is included in the data, it is possible that there are different impacts on model estimates. This may be especially true regarding the impact of mobility on the hazard function when the widths of measurement occasions are varied across individuals, as this may impact the timing of individual mobility.\nFuture studies should also examine other types of cross-classification not examined here,\nsuch as those that occur when higher-level units are not purely clustered within one another (e.g., students nested in a cross-classification of neighborhoods and schools), as well as alternative model specifications that account for individual mobility across clusters. For example, a future study may explore the performance of a multiple membership discrete-time survival (MM-DTS) model to account for mobility, which is different from the CC-DTS model investigated here in that it uses a weighting mechanism to account for mobility. Lamote et al. (2013) compared a MM-DTS model to the CC-DTS model and other models, and concluded that the CC-DTS\n210\nmodel fit the data best. However, in other real data situations, it may not be the case that the CCDTS model best fits the data, and the MM-DTS model could alternatively be used to account for mobility. As such, studies may also investigate the performance of a CC-DTS model when the mobility mechanism in the generated data does not exactly match the model specification, and assess the extent to which bias may occur in the CC-DTS model estimates when the impact of the multiple associated clusters, for example, is cumulative as opposed to noncumulative.\n211\nREFERENCES\nAllison, P.

In this formulation, the individual-level error terms are assumed to follow a\nstandard logistic distribution when the outcome is binary. For example, Moerbeek (2012) conducted a methodological study using discrete-time survival analysis, and when varying the variance-between clusters, reports the equivalent ICCs using this approach. However, this formulation of the ICC is equivalent to the ICC for the baseline model, or the model without covariates included. In this study, the generating model is a conditional model, and therefore, the between-clusters variance represents the residual variance, or the variance between-clusters after accounting for the variance described by the covariates included in the model. Therefore, the ICC was calculated to represent the residual ICC using the following equation:\n&'' = %&! !#\"(()#\")+,#!-\n%&!!#\"(()#\")+,#!-+&$!#%(()#%)+ &! ' ,\nwhere )( is the coefficient for the level-1 covariate, )\" is the coefficient for the level-2 covariate, *. is the probability that the level-2 covariate, Z, is equal to 1, */ is the probability that the level1 covariate, X, is equal to 1, and # !\n$ is the total variance at level-1.\nFor example, when the variance between-clusters was equal to 0.32, the ICC can be\ncalculated as:\n. 10 = &'' = (0.5 \" \u2217 0.3(1 \u2212 0.3) + 0.32)\n(0.5\" \u2217 0.3(1 \u2212 0.3) + 0.32) + 0.5\" \u2217 0.5(1 \u2212 0.5) + * \" 3\n283\nTechnical Appendix B: Data Generation in R\nlibrary(parallel)
