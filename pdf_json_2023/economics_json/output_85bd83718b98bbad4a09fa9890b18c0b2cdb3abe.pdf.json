            "text": "One of the most common assumptions in the trade literature is that firms choose profit-maximizing export prices separately for each market. This assumption is formally implemented by imposing that it is always cheaper to ship goods to customers in a market directly instead of via a third country - referred to as the triangle condition. This renders models substantially more tractable as interdependence between markets can be ignored in the price setting decision of firms.\nIn this paper, we relax the assumption of perfect market segmentation and examine optimal firm behavior when the triangle conditions are binding. We start with the empirical observation that firms are restricted in setting market-specific prices by the distance between export destinations. Conditional on direct trade costs, shorter distance between two export destinations is associated with lower price differentials that one firm charges for the same product. This suggests that the triangle condition is not universally true and it is important to understand the implications of trade liberalization in such a context. We refer to this case as integrated markets where firms need to take pricing constraints due to possible re-exporting arbitrage across countries into account. In contrast, we label perfect price discrimination across countries as segmented markets.\nWe develop a new mechanism that explicitly accounts for possible violations of the triangle condition and allows us to examine optimal export pricing of firms that face the associated pricing constraints. The mechanism is examined against the backdrop of the monopolistic competition trade model with heterogeneous firms and free entry as in Melitz (2003). For that, we modify an otherwise standard model by formulating stochastic market-specific export fixed costs such that (expected) aggregate profit is a continuously differentiable function. This allows us to address the main challenge of analyzing optimal behavior of firms under market interdependence when the decision to enter an export market is deterministic.1\nTo fix ideas, assume a single exporting country and two destination markets. Under CES preferences and monopolistic competition, direct trade costs are the only determinant of the differences in prices that firms from the exporting country\n1In the standard monopolistic competition framework (e.g. Melitz, 2003) firms either export or not so we end up with case comparisons that amount to 2J scenarios with J measuring the number of markets. This usually significantly complicates finding profit-maximizing export prices under market interdependence as the number of export markets itself depends on export prices.\n1\ncharge at two destinations as long as the triangle condition holds. If arbitrage between destination markets is profitable for third parties, however, we find that firms optimally adjust their market-specific export prices such that arbitrage is no longer possible. This leads to lower consumer prices in the final destination and higher consumer prices in the potential hub market through which arbitrage would take place. These changes in optimal prices lead to inefficiently high (low) export entry in the final destination (hub) country. These two effects lead to lower welfare for both importers. Hence, binding pricing constraints imply first-order effects through export prices that are typically ignored in structural trade analysis.\nWe go beyond this simple three-country example and calibrate our model using data on 40 countries for the year 2014. We use the calibrated model to run two counterfactual experiments. In the first experiment, all international trade costs are reduced by 20 percent. In the second experiment, we reduce bilateral trade costs by 20 percent for the subset of EU countries participating in the Single Market. While in both experiments welfare effects are generally positive and larger for small countries, they are strikingly lower when we do not explicitly enforce the triangle condition to hold and allow for possible pricing constraints. A general message is that the assumption of segmented markets leads to significantly higher estimates of gains from trade. For the case of a uniform 20-percent reduction in trade costs this \u2018bias\u2019 amounts to 15 percent (unweighted average) for the ten countries with the largest welfare gains from trade. For some countries like Ireland or Luxembourg, this factor reaches nearly 50 percent. In sum, the results indicate that the assumption of market segmentation is far from innocuous and has important quantitative implications for structural trade analysis.\nThis paper is related to several strands of the literature. First, we relate to the literature on price convergence across international markets (see Taylor, 2002; Goldberg and Verboven, 2005) and the law of one price (see Atkeson and Burstein, 2008; Steinwender, 2018; Rogoff et al., 2019). Our focus, however, is different because we emphasize how violations of the triangle conditions vis-\u00e0-vis a single export country lead to convergence in export prices across import destinations. Our specification also nests uniform pricing as a special case when trade costs between export markets are negligible (DellaVigna and Gentzkow, 2019).\nSecond, as we suggest a modelling approach that uses a stochastic specification of fixed export costs, the paper complements existing work by Jia (2008) or Antr\u00e0s et al. (2017) and provides tractable tools to study numerous other questions that\n2\nnecessarily imply interdependence between markets. For example, if firms are credit constrained the decision to export affects aggregate profits or wealth which in turn changes financing conditions and marginal costs (Holmstrom and Tirole, 1997). Under monopsonistic labor markets (Manning, 2013; Egger et al., 2019) or fairness preferences of workers (Akerlof and Yellen, 1990; Egger and Kreickemeier, 2012) export decisions feed back to firm profits, employment and thus firm-level wages. Learning from exporting is another example of such feedback effects, here channeling through firm productivity (De Loecker, 2013; Bai et al., 2017). A similar argument applies for investment decisions (e.g in physical capital stock or R&D) that is a function of all potential export destinations (Bustos, 2011). Finally, input-output linkages through global value chains imply a similar circularity between importing decisions and marginal costs (Antr\u00e0s et al., 2017).\nThe paper is organized as follows. We start in Section 2 with a simple three country example to build intuition and present motivating evidence that price differentials across destination markets are a function of trade costs between these markets. Section 3 introduces the theoretical framework with stochastic fixed costs. We simulate the model in Section 4 for three markets before turning to calibration (Section 5) and counterfactual analysis (Section 6) to assess the differences in welfare effects of trade liberalization under segmented and integrated markets. Section 7 concludes."

            "text": "How does the degree of possible market price segmentation depend on the level of trade costs? Typically, trade models based on monopolistic competition assume that firms are able to price discriminate perfectly across different markets. In this section, we provide evidence that suggests that the assumption of perfect market segmentation does not come to grips with the data.\nTo fix ideas, consider a firm \u03d5 in country i that selects export-market-specific prices to maximize profits. For simplicity, let us consider two potential export markets, k and j. The firm in i has to pay iceberg trade costs \u03c4ij \u2265 1 and \u03c4ik \u2265 1 to ship their product to consumers in the respective location. Typically, under monopolistic competition and CES preferences with the elasticity of substitution parameter \u03c3, the\n3\nfirm would charge the following prices in the two markets:\npij(\u03d5) = \u03c3 \u03c3 \u2212 1 wi\u03c4ij \u03d5 and pik(\u03d5) = \u03c3 \u03c3 \u2212 1 wi\u03c4ik \u03d5 \u21d2 pij(\u03d5) pik(\u03d5) = \u03c4ij \u03c4ik , (1)\nwhere wi is the wage in i and \u03d5 is used to index the product and productivity of a firm producing it. Under perfect market segmentation, the optimal prices in Eq. (1) are independent of \u03c4kj and \u03c4jk. However, if there is a threat of re-exporting, \u03c4kj and \u03c4jk become relevant because the following constraints must be satisfied to prevent it:\npik(\u03d5) \u2264 pij(\u03d5)\u03c4jk and pij(\u03d5) \u2264 pik(\u03d5)\u03c4kj \u21d2 1 \u03c4jk \u2264 pij(\u03d5) pik(\u03d5) \u2264 \u03c4kj. (2)\nCombining Eqs. (1) and (2) suggests that perfect market segmentation is possible if\n\u03c4ik \u2264 \u03c4ij\u03c4jk and \u03c4ij \u2264 \u03c4ik\u03c4kj. (3)\nThese two inequalities are known as trade costs triangle inequality and are customarily assumed to hold in quantitative trade models.2 If, however, the triangle inequality conditions are violated, firm \u03d5 will have to adjust pij(\u03d5) and pik(\u03d5) to eliminate possible re-exporting arbitrage. In this case, the difference between the prices that \u03d5 charges in markets k and j would depend on trade costs between the two markets. As this paper emphasizes the importance of the triangle condition for export entry and pricing, we do not allow for export platforms. Instead, we consider a situation where firms face a threat of re-export by a third party that would capture the entire variable markup. This threat is credible whenever the triangle condition is violated and it constrains firms in their export pricing decisions. To test this empirically, let\u2019s assume that \u03c4jk and \u03c4kj are symmetric and modify the relationship in equation (2):\n\u03b4i,kj \u2264 \u03c4kj, where \u03b4i,kj(\u03d5) = max { pij(\u03d5)\npik(\u03d5) , pik(\u03d5) pij(\u03d5)\n} . (4)\nThe inequality in Eq. (4) suggests that if markets are not perfectly segmented the maximum difference between the price that firm \u03d5 charges in j and k must be increasing in \u03c4kj. To test this hypothesis, we need data on the difference in prices that the same firm charges for the same product in different export markets as well as data on direct trade costs from i to those markets. We use data from Simonovska\n2In this paper, we also assume that \u03c4ii \u2264 \u03c4ij\u03c4ji for all i and j. This rules out the possibility of re-exporting back to the country of production.\n4\n(2015) that include prices charged in different markets for the same product by one of the largest apparel manufacturers from Spain.3 The data set includes information on 245 different goods and 29 export markets. Importantly, the data also contain information on ad valorem type trade costs from Spain to each export market. We supplement the data set with the data on bilateral distance between j and k and a dummy for common language from CEPII. We then estimate the following regression for i = Spain:\nln \u03b4\u03d5kj = \u03b3 ln(distancekj) + \u03c1 ln(languagekj) + Zkj\u0393 + \u03b7\u03d5 + \u00b5k + \u00b5j + \u03b5\u03d5kj, (5)\nwhere Zkj is a vector of controls and \u03b5\u03d5kj is the stochastic error term. We also include \u03b7\u03d5, \u00b5k, and \u00b5j that capture product-specific, market-j-specific and market-k-specific fixed effects. The dependent variable captures relative consumer prices as defined above, i.e. including ad valorem trade costs from i to j and k. The coefficients of interest are \u03b3 and \u03c1. If \u03b4\u03d5kj is positively related to \u03c4kj, we expect \u03b3 > 0 and \u03c1 < 0.\nThe results in Table 1 suggest that the relationship between the maximum price difference in markets k and j for the same product imported from the same firm from i is positively related to (log) distance and negatively related to the measure of common language. These results are robust across several specifications and suggest that the triangle conditions in Eq. (3) that guarantee perfect market segmentation\n3We are thankful to Ina Simonovska for sharing her data for this paper.\n5\nare violated in the data. This means that optimal export prices would deviate from those specified in Eq. (1). Motivated by these insights, we develop a general equilibrium framework that allows us to examine the implications of binding pricing constraints for optimal firm behavior and welfare in integrated markets."

To keep the model computationally tractable, we assume that \u03d5 is drawn from a country-specific (Pareto) distribution \u03d5 \u223c gi(\u03d5), with location parameter bi and shape parameter \u03b2.

When pricing and export decisions depend on all markets, this results in a combinatorial problem with 2J choices and quickly becomes intractable even with a moderate number of countries J . The binary endogenous outcome of exporting vs. non-exporting then implies non-monotonic and not continuously differentiable aggregate profit functions, which significantly complicates finding globally optimal export pricing and entry decisions. To overcome this obstacle, we assume that firms experience market-specific shocks \u03f5ij \u2208 [ai;\u221e) for each potential market such that total export fixed costs are wifij/\u03f5ij. A high level of \u03f5ij implies low fixed costs and higher profits earned from that market. To keep the model tractable, we assume that the distribution of \u03f5ij is Pareto with lower bound ai and shape parameter \u03b1.4 Converting export entry decisions into a probabilistic problem allows us to specify expected aggregate profits from all export markets as the following continuously differentiable function:\nmax pij(\u03d5) E\u03f5 (\u03a0i(\u03d5)) = \u2211 j Iij(\u03d5) ( 1 1 + \u03b1 Vij(\u03d5)wifij ) (9)\ns.t. pij \u2264 pik\u03c4kj \u2200 k \u0338= i, j,\nwhere Iij(\u03d5) denotes the probability for firm \u03d5 producing in market i to serve market 4The corresponding density function and the cumulative distribution function are given by h(\u03f5ij) = \u03b1a \u03b1 i /\u03f5 \u03b1+1 ij and H(\u03f5ij) = 1\u2212 (ai/\u03f5ij)\u03b1.\n7\nj and we have defined\nVij(\u03d5) \u2261\n( pij(\u03d5)\n1\u2212\u03c3 \u2212 pij(\u03d5)\u2212\u03c3 wi\u03c4ij \u03d5\n) wjLjP \u03c3\u22121 j\nwifij .

Expressed in terms of the stochastic cost component, this determines the zero-profit cutoff realization of the shock\n\u03f5ij \u2265 1\nVij(\u03d5) , (11)\nwhich holds with equality for the marginal firm. Notice that even the least productive firm can draw a sufficiently high \u03f5ij to be profitable in country j so the productivity cutoff is exogenously given by the lower bound of the distribution function. It is therefore meaningful to interpret Iij(\u03d5) as the share of exporting firms with a given productivity\nIij(\u03d5) \u2261 Pr(\u03f5ij \u2265 \u03f5\u2217ij) = a\u03b1Vij(\u03d5)\u03b1. (12)\nNotice that our general formulation of aggregate profits nests both perfect market segmentation and integrated markets. Each firm optimally sets pij to maximize this objective function subject to the constraints that pij \u2264 pik\u03c4kj \u2200k \u0338= i, j. Assuming that none of these constraints are binding, we fall back to the perfect market segmentation case with profit-maximizing prices\npij = \u03c3 \u03c3 \u2212 1 \u03c4ijwi \u03d5 .\nWhen price setting depends on optimal prices in other markets, we move to numerical solutions. It is important to highlight that the probabilistic formulation of aggregate profits allows us to derive globally optimal prices while circumventing the combinatory problem of comparing 2J cases."

            "heading": "4 Simulation: A three-country example",
            "text": "To build intuition, we first solve the model numerically for the simplest case of three countries. As shown in Figure 1, we choose initial trade cost levels such that the triangle conditions are satisfied for all country pairs. This means that arbitrage is not profitable. Notice that for market j the triangular condition holds with equality as \u03c4ij = \u03c4ik\u03c4kj. We then reduce trade costs between k and j and explore how prices, export probabilities, and welfare respond under both segmented and integrated markets.\nIn a first step, we focus on optimal export prices and export propensities of firms in market i. Reducing trade costs to \u03c4kj = 1.5 violates the triangle condition, so \u03c4ij > \u03c4ik\u03c4kj, introducing a threat of arbitrage between markets k and j. This threat induces firms to deviate from the optimal export prices that they charge under perfect segmentation. Panels (a) and (b) of Figure 2 plot profit-maximizing export prices pij and pik as a function of firm productivity \u03d5 for these different scenarios. If the triangle condition holds (\u03c4kj = 2.5), firms charge the same prices under both regimes as described by the solid lines, i.e. psegij = pintij and p seg ik = p int ik , where the superscripts denote the two market regimes. The figure further reveals that pij > pik due to differences in bilateral trade costs and more productive firms charge lower prices, like e.g. in Melitz (2003). Reducing \u03c4jk to 1.5 has no effect on\n10\nmarket i\u2032s export prices under segmented markets as the triangle pricing restriction is ignored by assumption. With integrated markets, however, firms in market i respond by lowering pij and raising pik until the triangular condition holds again. The magnitude of price adjustments depends on the size of markets. If the hub market k is small, firms do not lose much profit if they increased pik. If that country is large relative to market j, however, firms would increase pik relatively less. These price responses imply that markups are no longer constant across markets. If variable trade barriers between k and j vanish entirely, i.e. \u03c4kj = 1, exporters in market i would charge the same consumer prices in both j and k despite different bilateral trade costs.\n11\nTurning to export probabilities, panels (c) and (d) visually document how the stochastic shock on export fixed costs ensures that there is no export cutoff that separates firms into exporters and non-exporters. Instead, the propensity to export is positive and increasing in firm productivity. This feature of our model is in line with firm-level evidence presented in the next section (see Table 3 below). While I(\u03d5) is identical in both regimes for \u03c4kj = 2.5 (solid lines), export propensities differ once the pricing constraint becomes binding. Under segmented markets, and in the opposite direction relative to prices, the reduction in bilateral trade costs between k and j reduces Iij(\u03d5) and raises Iik(\u03d5). For the former case, the reduction is less acute for the integrated case, whereas for the latter the opposite is true. These effects as well as the differences between the segmented and integrated cases are explained by two components. First, the reduction in \u03c4kj creates general equilibrium effects making exporters from i less competitive relative to exporters from k in market j. Second, some of these effects are mitigated by the reduction in export prices under market integration such that the reduction in pij in panel (c) is relatively less acute under market integration. The same logic applies to the results in panel (d). Reduction in \u03c4kj leads to increases in exporting probabilities form k to j under both regimes. However, the effect is magnified in the integrated case due to the additional price effect depicted in panel (b).\nWith these insights at hand, we now compare the effects of lower trade costs between markets k and j for welfare of each country under both regimes.5 As is evident from Figure 3, countries j and k experience lower welfare gains under integrated than segmented markets once the pricing constraint becomes binding. The intuition relies on the fact that additional constraints in the export pricing decision are sub-\n5See Appendix for further details on wages and price indices.\n12\noptimal from the perspective of firms in i. Hence, even though firms from i charge lower prices in market j under integrated markets, they also face a lower probability of exporting to that market. These factors together lower consumer welfare via distortions in the optimal combination of the intensive and extensive margins of trade. A similar logic applies to market k. Though the individual directions of the price and export probability effects go in the opposite direction relative to market j, the combination of the two deviates from the optimum, which leads to relatively lower welfare. Figure 3 also suggests that the welfare in country i is higher in the integrated case relative to the segmented case for moderate reductions in \u03c4kj. The difference is quantitatively small and can be explained by the general equilibrium effects that lower the overall price index in country i relatively more when k and j are integrated.\nAs countries differ in several respects in the real world, we explore the role of country size by doubling population in each of the three markets at a time while sticking to the reduction in bilateral trade costs \u03c4jk from 2.5 to 1.5 as above. Table 2 summarizes the findings.\nIn the first experiment, where we double the country size of the relevant exporter i, we observe that k experiences negative welfare gains relative to the baseline case where countries are symmetric in size. This is intuitive since when Li is high, country i is an important exporter for market k. Hence, distortions in i in the form of higher\n13\nexport prices have a more pronounced effect on country k. In the second experiment, we double the size of the destination country j. In this case, the gains of country k are higher than in the benchmark. The intuition behind this result lies in the relative changes in ij-specific and ik-specific prices and export probabilities. As producers in i view market j as relatively more important (due to its economic size) they react strongly in their changes towards that market, which means that the distortions relevant for market k are less severe. This is confirmed in the results of the third experiment, where we double the size of market k. Here the gains of market j are larger than in the baseline due to relatively lower ij-specific distortions in prices and export probabilities."

Even if firm-level decisions depend on all markets, this approach ensures tractability.\nWe show that assuming market segmentation is far from being innocuous. Comparing welfare changes in response to a uniform reduction of bilateral trade costs of 20 percent reveals that ignoring potential pricing constraints delivers higher welfare gains for almost all OECD countries compared to integrated markets. For the ten countries with the highest gains, the ratio of welfare gains between the segmented and the integrated regime amounts to 22 percent, reaching close to 50 percent for some countries. We conclude that accounting for pricing constraints is important for the correct evaluation of the effects of falling trade costs on trade and welfare.\n19"
