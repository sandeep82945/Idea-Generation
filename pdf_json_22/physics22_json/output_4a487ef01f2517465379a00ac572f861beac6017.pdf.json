    "abstractText": "We study the backaction of quantum measurements on heat transport through a two-level system by considering the continuous quantum measurement onto an eigen state of the two-level system. For the nonselective measurement, the backaction appears as a dephasing effect on the two-level system. We formulate the heat current under the selective measurement with a stochastic master equation and show that the cross-correlation between the measurement outcomes and the heat current contains information on the backaction. We expect that our findings can be verified by using a platform of superconducting circuits.",

For the nonselective measurement, the backaction appears as a dephasing effect on the two-level system. We formulate the heat current under the selective measurement with a stochastic master equation and show that the cross-correlation between the measurement outcomes and the heat current contains information on the backaction. We expect that our findings can be verified by using a platform of superconducting circuits.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nMeasurement is indispensable to access the information on a system. Quantum measurements usually disturb a quantum system and thus destroy quantum correlations, in striking contrast to the classical realm in which unperturbed measurement is possible in principle [1]. This backaction of the quantum measurement triggers many intriguing phenomena. For example, in quantum many-body systems constituting large-scale entanglements, the quantum backaction induces various nontrivial effects, e.g., measurement-induced phase transitions [2\u20136], non-Hermitian dynamics [7\u20139], and suppression of the Kondo effect [10]. Moreover, quantum backaction has been observed in well-controllable systems of cold atoms [11\u201315] and of solid-state nanostructures [16]. In particular, a superconducting circuit is an ideal platform for exploring quantum backaction on many-body states. This is because experimental efforts toward the realization of quantum computers have enabled highspeed readout of qubits\u2019 information and controlled interaction of a single qubit with other qubits or electromagnetic fields [17, 18]. Recently, thermal engines under quantum measurement have been proposed theoretically in light of superconducting circuits [19, 20].\nContinuous measurement has a significant impact on transport through a small quantum object since transport properties reflect quantum states of such an object [21, 22]. The simplest example is heat transport through a two-level system, i.e., a qubit. Recent developments in experimental techniques have enabled us to accurately measure heat current through a qubit and have stimulated theoretical and experimental studies [23\u2013 29]. Contrary to its apparent simplicity, quantum transport via a qubit exhibits many-body effects due to strong qubit-bath coupling, e.g., the Kondo effect [30\u201336] and quantum phase transitions [30, 31, 37\u201344]. Moreover, since the transferred heat is related to entropy production [29, 45], heat transport under measurement is also a key to demonstrating Maxwell\u2019s demon and shedding\n\u2217 yamamoto.tsuyoshi.ga@u.tsukuba.ac.jp\nlight on the relation between energy and information [46\u2013 51]. In that sense, it is cross-cutting to consider measurement effects in heat transport from the viewpoint of uniting condensed matter physics and information theory.\nIn this paper, we consider heat transport through a two-level system and examine how heat transport is affected by a continuous quantum measurement onto an eigenstate of the two-level system (see Fig. 1). We calculate the heat current by using the master equation which takes quantum measurement processes followed by postselection into account. First, we show that the dephasing induced by continuous measurement modifies the heat current. To clarify the backaction in detail, we further calculate the cross-correlation between the heat current and the measurement outcomes in the selective measurement scheme. By introducing this quantity, it becomes possible to discuss the backaction to nonequilibrium transport phenomena more directly in feasible experimental setups. We expect that the present experimental techniques enable the measurement setup to be realized in the form of superconducting circuits. ar X iv :2\n20 8.\n08 75\n5v 2\n[ co\nnd -m\nat .m\nes -h\nal l]\n2 9\nN ov\n2 02\n2\n2"

Assuming that the temperature difference between the two heat baths is sufficiently small, i.e., TL/R = T \u00b1 \u03b4T/2 with \u03b4T/T 1, we can obtain an analytical formula for the steady-state heat current \u3008J\u3009 = \u3008JL\u3009 = \u2212\u3008JR\u3009 up to first order in \u03b4T by using the Keldysh formalism, as [35, 56, 57]\n\u3008J\u3009 = \u03b1\u03b7kB\u03b4T 16 \u222b \u221e 0 d\u03c9 S(\u03c9)I\u0303(\u03c9) (\u03b2~\u03c9)2 sinh(\u03b2~\u03c9) , (8)\nwhere \u03b1 = \u03b1L + \u03b1R, \u03b7 = 4\u03b1L\u03b1R/\u03b1 2, I\u0303(\u03c9) = Ir(\u03c9)/\u03b1r, and \u03b2 = 1/(kBT ). Here, S(\u03c9) is the Fourier transformation of a symmetrized correlation function, S(t) = \u3008{\u03c3z(t), \u03c3z(0)}\u3009/2. From the Lindblad equation (7), S(\u03c9) reads [58]\nS(\u03c9) = 4\u0393\u0303s(\u2206\n2 + \u0393\u03032s )\n[(\u03c9 \u2212\u2206)2 + \u0393\u03032s ][(\u03c9 + \u2206)2 + \u0393\u03032s ] , (9)\nwhere \u0393\u0303s = (\u0393s + \u03b3m)/2 and \u0393s = \u2211 r(\u0393r+ + \u0393r\u2212) [59].\nThe steady-state heat current \u3008J\u3009 is plotted as a function of temperature in Fig. 2. It shows a nonmonotonic behavior as a function of temperature. This behavior can be described by sequential tunneling process in which heat is transported by a combination of energy absorption and\n3\nemission accompanied by transitions between the ground and excited states of the two-level system [60]. In this process, the heat current is enhanced when the temperature is compatible with the energy splitting ~\u2206 of the two-level system. As the strength of continuous quantum measurement, \u03b3m, increases, the peak of the heat current is suppressed. As indicated, this suppression is induced by an increase in the level broadening in the response function (9) (\u0393s \u2192 2\u0393\u0303s) due to the additional damping induced by the nonselective quantum measurement.\nHere, we briefly explain how the nonselective measurement is related to the selective measurement discussed in Sec. IV. In general, the backaction of quantum measurement depends on its outcomes. In the nonselective measurement, however, the backaction is averaged out for all the possible outcomes with their probabilities. Figure 3 illustrates the relation between the heat current for the nonselective measurement and an original singleshot sample. Before ensemble averaging, the heat current changes instantaneously according to the measurement outcomes at random times. The set of times at which the heat current jumps is different from other ensembles, and the ensemble-averaged heat current is reduced to the one on the nonselective measurement. Therefore, to access information on the backaction effect depending on the outcomes, we need to consider a physical quantity that represents the correlation between the outcome and the corresponding resultant heat current. For this purpose, we will introduce the correlation function in the next section."

In the Markov limit and assuming that the coherence can be neglected on the relevant time scale, the heat current flowing from the heat bath r (= L,R) into the two-level system is expressed as [60] \u3008Jr(t)\u3009c = ~\u2206[\u0393r+pgc(t)\u2212\u0393r\u2212pec(t)], where p g(e) c = \u3008g(e)| \u03c1\u0303c |g(e)\u3009 = (1 \u00b1 \u3008\u03c3x\u3009c)/2 is the population of the ground (excited) state. For simplicity, we will consider a symmetric heat bath (\u03b1/2 = \u03b1L = \u03b1R) hereinafter. When the temperature difference \u03b4T is sufficiently small, the net heat current flowing from the heat bath L to R, \u3008J(t)\u3009 = (\u3008JL(t)\u3009 \u2212 \u3008JR(t)\u3009)/2, can be expressed to first order in \u03b4T as\n\u3008J(t)\u3009c = \u03c0I(\u2206)kB\u03b4T\n8 sinhc2(\u03b2~\u2206/2) \u3008\u03c3x(t)\u3009c , (13)\n4\nwhere I(\u2206) = \u2211 r Ir(\u2206) and sinhc(x) = sinh(x)/x.\nA sample of the conditional heat current \u3008J(t)\u3009c under a continuous quantum measurement onto |+\u3009 is shown in Fig. 3. Several quantum jumps in the time evolution of \u3008J(t)\u3009c are characteristic to the selective measurement. After detection, the conditional heat current jumps to a definite value because the state of the two-level system is projected to the state |+\u3009. In contrast, the heat current tends to relax to a stationary point during periods in which there were no detections (\u2206N+ = 0). Thus the dynamics of the conditional heat current can be described by stochastic quantum trajectories composed of continuous dynamics during the no-detection periods (\u2206N+ = 0) and quantum jumps (\u2206N+ = 1). The conditional heat current under selective measurement onto |\u2212\u3009 can be formulated in a similar way. The ensemble average of the conditional heat current on these trajectories, E[\u3008J(t)\u3009c], (the red line in Fig. 3) reproduces the heat current under the nonselective measurement (the dashed line in Fig. 3) [63],\n\u3008J(t)\u3009 = \u03c0I(\u2206)kB\u03b4T (\u03b2~\u2206)2 16 sinh(\u03b2~\u2206) ( 1\u2212 e\u2212\u0393st ) .

            "text": "So far, we focused on the steady-state heat current. From now on, let us consider to what extent the measurement outcomes and the heat current are correlated in time to discuss the backaction due to the continuous quantum measurement onto |i = \u00b1\u3009. For this purpose, we introduce the cross-correlation between the measure-\nment outcomes and the heat current defined by\nFi(t) = E\n[ 1\nt1 \u2212 t0 \u222b t1 t0 dt\u2032 \u03b4\u2206Ni(t \u2032)\u03b4 \u3008J(t+ t\u2032)\u3009c ] ,\n(15)\nwhere \u03b4A = A \u2212 E[A]. Using Eq. (13), the crosscorrelation reads\nFi(t) = \u03c0I(\u2206)kB\u03b4T\n8sinhc2(\u03b2~\u2206/2) Fi(t), (16)\nwhere\nFi(t) = 1\nt1 \u2212 t0 \u222b t1 t0 dt\u2032 { E[\u2206Ni(t \u2032) \u3008\u03c3x(t+ t\u2032)\u3009c]\n\u2212 E[\u2206Ni(t\u2032)]E[\u3008\u03c3x(t+ t\u2032)\u3009c] } . (17)\nAt large t0, t1 \u0393\u22121s , we can replace E[\u3008\u03c3x(t\u2032)\u3009c] with the stationary solution, \u3008\u03c3x\u3009ss = tanh(\u03b2~\u2206/2) [64]. Moreover, the averaged interval time between adjacent measurement events (\u2206Ni = 1) can be assumed to be much longer than the inverse of the decay rate of \u3008\u03c3x(t)\u3009, i.e., (E[\u2206Ni]/\u2206t)\n\u22121 \u0393\u22121s . This assumption is justified in our setup, in which a detection is a rare event according to the Poisson process. In this situation, the contributions from two different measurement events can be neglected after taking the ensemble average, and the first term in the integrand in Eq. (17) can be replaced with a product of the probability of \u2206Ni(t\n\u2032) = 1 and \u3008\u03c3x(t+ t\u2032)\u3009 with the initial condition \u3008\u03c3x(t\u2032)\u3009 = \u00b11. Finally, we obtain the analytic expression for the cross-correlation as\nF\u00b1(t)\n\u2206t = \u00b1\u03b3\u00b1m\n\u03c0I(\u2206)kB\u03b4T\n16sinhc2(\u03b2~\u2206) e\u2212\u0393st. (18)\nThis expression indicates that the cross-correlations under the continuous quantum measurement onto |\u00b1\u3009 decay exponentially with the decay rate \u0393s and have opposite signs, i.e., F+(0\n+)/\u03b3+m = \u2212F\u2212(0+)/\u03b3\u2212m > 0. Figure 4(a) shows the results of numerical simulations of the cross-correlation F+(t). We can observe that the cross-correlation decays exponentially, F+(t)/F+(0) = e\u2212\u0393st, and its decay is faster as the coupling becomes stronger. This numerical result completely agrees with the analytical expression (18), indicating that the assumption of the rare detection holds well. As shown in the inset of Fig. 4(a), we observe that the normalized cross-correlations Fi(t)/Fi(0\n+) for different \u03b3im = 0.01\u2212 0.1 collapse to the same curve. This indicates that the strength of the quantum measurement appears only in the amplitude of the cross-correlation, being linear to \u03b3im. The inset also confirms that F+(t)/\u03b3 + m = \u2212F\u2212(r)/\u03b3\u2212m > 0 holds. Finally, let us consider the integrated cross-correlation,\nGi = \u222b \u221e 0 dt Fi(t). (19)\n5\nThe temperature dependence of the integrated crosscorrelation is shown in Fig. 4(b) for \u03b1 = 0.01, 0.05, and 0.1. The numerical simulations for different values of \u03b1 collapse to the same curve, which indicates that the integrated cross-correlation is independent of the coupling strength \u03b1. These numerical simulations coincide with the analytic expression of G+/\u2206t obtained from Eq. (18),\nG\u00b1 \u2206t = \u00b1\u03b3\u00b1mkB\u03b4T tanh(\u03b2~\u2206/2) 8sinhc2(\u03b2~\u2206) , (20)\nwhich is indicated by the solid line in Fig. 4(b). The reason why G\u00b1 is independent of \u03b1 is explained as follows. The integrated cross-correlation can be rewritten as\nGi \u2206t = E[\u2206Ni]ssQ ex i , (21)\nwhere E[\u2206Ni]ss is a stationary solution of the Poisson increment and Qexi is excess heat due to the quantum\nmeasurement defined by\nQexi = \u222b \u221e 0 dt [\u3008J(t)\u3009 \u2212 \u3008J\u3009ss] . (22)\nThe excess heat represents a disturbance of the two-level system by the quantum measurement, and therefore it is expected to be independent of the system-bath coupling, which governs the time scale of relaxation. In fact, we can explicitly write down excess heat as\nQex\u00b1 = \u00b1 lim \u03b4T\u21920 nL(\u2206)\u2212 nR(\u2206) 2 \u2206 2 \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223\u0393a\u0393s \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 \u0393\u00b1\u0393s , (23)\nwhere \u0393a = \u2211 r(\u0393r+ \u2212 \u0393r\u2212) and \u0393\u00b1 = \u0393L\u00b1 + \u0393R\u00b1. Since the rates \u0393s, \u0393a, and \u0393\u00b1 are determined by Fermi\u2019s golden rule, they are proportional to the spectral density. Therefore excess heat is independent of the information of the system-bath coupling, i.e., the coupling strength, the cutoff function, and the type of heat bath. Since E[\u2206Ni]ss is also independent of \u03b1, the integrated crosscorrelation Gi given in Eq. (21) becomes independent of the system-bath coupling."

The heat current through a small circuit can be measured with present technology, as demonstrated in recent experiments [26\u201329]. In Ref.

Thus the condition, ~\u2206 \u2248 kBT , required to observe the backaction discussed in this paper can be fulfilled. To measure the integrated cross-correlation, the outcomes from continuous monitoring of the two-level system should be used as a trigger for the subsequent measurement of the integrated heat current within a finite period, which should be larger than the inverse of the decay rate \u0393\u22121s . This conditional heat current will deviate from the steadystate heat current without monitoring. We emphasize that the sign of this deviation depends on which of the states |\u00b1\u3009 is used for the continuous quantum measurement on the two-level system."

We found, in the nonselective measurement scheme, that the heat current is affected by the quantum measurement through the dephasing effect. In addition, to observe\n6 the backaction effect directly, we calculated the crosscorrelation between the measurement outcomes and the heat current. The introduction of this quantity constitutes a first step towards evaluating the backaction of continuous quantum measurement on nonequilibrium transport phenomena in light of feasible setups. We found that the cross-correlation depends on which of the eigenstates of the two-level system is to be measured and that the integrated cross-correlation is enhanced when the temperature becomes comparable with the energy splitting of the two-level system. Our work, focusing on a weak system-bath coupling, represents a starting point for further research on measurement-induced transport phenomena in feasible setups. It remains challenging to clarify new quantum many-body effects induced by quantum measurement. We believe that our work provides a cross-cutting bridge between condensed matter physics and information theory from the viewpoint of nonequilibrium transport phenomena under continuous quantum measurement."

Instantaneously after the detec-\ntion at t, the conditional density matrix is projected to the eigenstate |i\u3009,\n\u03c1c(t) = Pi\u03c1c(t\u2212\u2206t)Pi \u3008Pi(t)\u3009c , (B2)\nwhere P\u00b1 = |\u00b1\u3009 \u3008\u00b1| is the projective operator. By plugging the conditional density matrix (B2) into the bracket in the heat current (B1), we obtain\u2329\n\u03c3z(t) [ bLk(t)\u2212 b\u2020Lk(t) ]\u232a c\n= tr [ \u03c1c(t)\u03c3z ( bLk \u2212 b\u2020Lk )] = tr [ \u03c1c(t\u2212\u2206t)Pi\u03c3zPi ( bLk \u2212 b\u2020Lk )] \u3008Pi(t)\u3009c = 0, (B3)\nwhere we have used the cyclic property, [Pi, b (\u2020) Lk] = 0, and Pi\u03c3zPi = 0. Therefore, when \u2206Ni = 1, heat current does not flow, i.e., \u3008JL(t)\u3009c = 0.\nFinally, we note that the contribution of the heat current at the detection does not matter for the ensemble values in our numerical simulations at the \u2206t\u2192 0 limit.\n[1] H.

[58] Using the quantum regression theorem [53], the dynam-\nics of the correlation function Czz(t) = \u3008\u03c3z(t)\u03c3z(0)\u3009 are determined by the differential equation, C\u0308zz + 2\u0393\u0303sC\u0307zz + (\u22062 + \u0393\u03032s )Czz = 0, and its solution is given by Czz(t) = e\u2212\u0393\u0303st[cos(\u2206t) + (\u0393\u0303s/\u2206) sin(\u2206t)] under the initial condi-\ntions Czz(0) = 1 and C\u0307zz(0) = 0. [59] The heat transport process discussed in this paper is\ncalled a sequential tunneling process, which can describe heat transport for kBT \u223c ~\u2206. However, at lower temperatures, kBT . 0.1~\u2206, the sequential tunneling process is suppressed, and thus the co-tunneling process becomes dominant, in which the higher-order interaction between the two-level system and the heat baths plays the important role [36, 65].

[62] In our simulation, the heat current under the condition, \u2206Ni = 1, can be defined arbitrarily, because the number of time steps in this condition is much less than the number in \u2206Ni = 0 in the limit \u2206t\u2192 0. See Appendix B for details. [63] We can reproduce this expression for the heat current at t\u2192\u221e by plugging S(\u03c9) \u2248 \u03c0\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212\u2206) into Eq. (8). [64] The stationary solution of \u3008\u03c3x\u3009 is calculated by solving the differential equation \u3008\u03c3\u0307x\u3009 = \u2212\u0393s \u3008\u03c3x\u3009 \u2212 \u0393a under the steady-state condition \u3008\u03c3\u0307x\u3009 = 0.
