    "abstractText": "We consider a multi-user two-ray ground reflection scenario with unknown distances between transmitter and receivers. By using two frequencies per user in parallel, we can mitigate possible destructive interference and ensure ultrareliability with only very limited knowledge at the transmitter. In this work, we consider the problem of assigning two frequencies to each receiver in a multi-user communication system such that the average minimum receive power is maximized. In order to solve this problem, we introduce a generalization of the quadratic multiple knapsack problem to include heterogeneous profits and develop an algorithm to solve it. Compared to random frequency assignment, we report a gain of around 6 dB in numerical simulations.",

INTRODUCTION\nReliability is a major requirement for many modern applications of wireless communication systems [1], [2]. In particular, this includes autonomous vehicles, e.g., self-driving cars and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). It is therefore of great interest to develop techniques, which enable ultra-reliable communications. This is especially important for scenarios where only limited information, e.g., channel state information (CSI), is available at the communication parties, e.g., due to high mobility or in frequency-division duplex (FDD) systems.\nAmong others, it has been observed that negative dependency between channel gains can significantly improve reliability [3]\u2013 [5]. The basic idea is to establish diversity and ensure that always one communication link is available, if the others fail. In the following, we will use this idea to develop a simple frequency diversity scheme that enables ultra-reliable communications in two-ray ground reflection scenarios. In this two-ray model, it is assumed that only one significant multipath component exists in addition to a line-of-sight (LoS) connection. The second component is typically caused by a single reflection on a ground surface. This could occur in flat outdoor terrain [6], on large concrete areas, e.g., airports [7], and for a UAV flying above water [8], [9]. It has also been observed that the two-ray model can be appropriate for vehicle-to-vehicle\nThe work of E. Jorswieck is partly supported by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research Germany (BMBF) as part of the 6G Research and Innovation Cluster 6G-RIC under Grant 16KISK020K. The work of J. Coon is supported by the EPSRC under grant number EP/T02612X/1.\n(V2V) communication scenarios [10], [11]. This includes high frequency bands like millimeter wave (mmWave) [12]\u2013[14].\nIn general, the curvature of the Earth\u2019s surface needs to be considered for long-distance outdoor settings and accurate models like the curved-Earth model [8], [15], [16] exist. However, when considering relatively short distances, the flatEarth model is a valid approximation [8], [16], which we adopt throughout this work.\nWhen varying the distance between transmitter and receiver, the relative phase of the two received signal components varies and they may interfere constructively or destructively. A destructive interference causes a drop of receive power, which in turn could cause an outage of the communication link. In order to mitigate drops of the signal power on one frequency, a second frequency can be used in parallel. The use of multiple frequencies in parallel to create diversity and improve the reliability in ground reflection scenarios has already been proposed in [3] and [17]. In [18], it is analyzed and experimentally verified that frequency diversity improves the performance of distance measurements in outdoor ground reflection scenarios. Instead of using multiple frequencies in parallel, it was shown experimentally in [7] that using multiple antennas and carefully choosing the spacing between them can also improve the received power.\nIn practical communication systems, we are often given a fixed set of available frequencies. If there exist multiple users with unknown distances, the following questions immediately arises: how should the frequencies be assigned to the users in order to maximize the worst-case receive power? Such an optimization problem of assigning discrete items to users belongs to the broad class of knapsack problems [19].\nIn this work, we consider the problem of assigning each user in a multi-user communication system two frequencies such that the average worst-case receive power is maximized. Our main contributions are summarized as follows. \u2022 We analyze the worst-case received power for a two-\nray ground reflection model with unknown distance between transmitter and receiver when employing only a single frequency (Section III-A) and when employing two frequencies in parallel (Section III-B). \u2022 We formulate the problem of assigning frequencies to users with unknown distances as a knapsack problem.

We then present an algorithm to find a solution to it. (Section V) \u2022 Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed solution by numerical examples and report a gain of up to 6 dB compared to a random frequency assignment. (Section VI)\nIn [20], we analyze a similar two-ray model with two frequencies in parallel. However, we only consider a single user and focus on optimizing the frequency spacing instead of assuming a fixed set of available frequencies.\nNOTATION\nAn overview of the most commonly used variable notation can be found in Table I.\nIn order to simplify the notation, we will omit variables on which functions depend when their value is clear from the context, e.g., we will write f(x) instead of f(x, y) when the value of y is fixed.\nSince the angular frequency \u03c9 = 2\u03c0f is a simple scaling of the frequency f , we will treat them somewhat interchangeably. Especially for calculations, it is more convenient to use \u03c9, while f is relevant for actual system design. We will therefore use the frequency f for the numerical examples while expressing all formulas in terms of the angular frequency \u03c9.\nThe uniform distribution on the interval [a, b] is denoted as unif[a, b]."

For each user u, only a range of possible\ndistances is known, i.e., it is known that du \u2208 [dmin,u, dmax,u]. An illustration can be found in Fig. 1. It should be noted that the intervals of the individual users may overlap or even be the same. The transmitter is fixed at height hTx above the ground while the users are located at heights hRx,u above the ground.\nThe scenario is considered to be in a flat terrain, e.g., UAVs flying above a flat water surface. Based on this, the propagation environment is approximated as a plane reflecting ground surface and therefore modeled by the classical two-ray ground reflection model [21, Chap. 4.6]. This geometrical model for a single receiver is depicted in Fig. 2.\nBased on the setup, it can be seen that the transmitted signal is propagated via two separate paths to the receiver. On the one hand, there exists a LoS propagation with path length `u. On the other hand, the signal is also reflected by the ground, which leads to the second component. The total length of the second ray is \u02dc\u0300u. Finally, these two components superimpose at the receiver.\nFrom basic trigonometric considerations, the path lengths can be calculated as\n`2u = (hTx \u2212 hRx,u)2 + d2u (1) \u02dc\u03002 u = (hTx + hRx,u) 2 + d2u .

For simplicity, we assume a perfectly reflecting ground throughout this work. However, all of the calculations can be adapted to include an additional attenuation due to the absorption on the ground.\nIt is well-known that the two components can interfere constructively or destructively at the receiver, depending on the distance d. This leads to local minima in the receive power at certain distances, which in turn can lead to outages in the transmission. In order to mitigate these drops in receive power, we propose to use a second frequency in parallel. However, there exists a set F = {f1, . . . , fN} of N given frequencies fi which can be assigned to the individual users. This directly leads to the question about how the frequencies should be assigned to the users such that the overall reliability of the system is maximized. The exact problem formulation is described in the following."

Only the ranges of possible distances are known, i.e., du \u2208 [dmin,u, dmax,u].\nBased on this knowledge, the transmitter needs to assign distinct frequencies fi from a set F of given frequencies to the users. In order to ensure a high reception quality at any distance, the transmitter may employ up to two frequencies in parallel for each user, such that we can compensate for possible destructive interference of the two rays. This leads to the following problem.\nProblem Statement 1. Since the transmitter only knows the range of du, i.e., that du \u2208 [dmin,u, dmax,u], we try to assign the frequencies such that the average worst-case receive power of the system is maximized.

Therefore, we first investigate the distances at which such drops in receive power occur.\n1) Destructive Interference: From (3), it can be seen that we get a (local) minimum of the receive power when the direct and reflected signals interfere destructively [22]. This occurs whenever the phase difference \u2206\u03c6 is a multiple of 2\u03c0, i.e.,\n\u2206\u03c6 = \u03c9\nc\n( \u02dc\u0300\u2212 ` ) = 2\u03c0k, k \u2208 N0 .

Hence, there always exists a finite number of multiples of 2\u03c0 with kmax = b\u2206\u03c6max2\u03c0 c, i.e., there exist kmax local minima of the receive power.\nThe distance dk at which the k-th minimum occurs, is given by solving (5) as\nd2k(\u03c9) =\n( (c\u03c0k)2 \u2212 (\u03c9hRx)2 ) ( (c\u03c0k)2 \u2212 (\u03c9hTx)2 ) (\u03c9c\u03c0k)2\n(6)\nwith k = 1, . . . , kmax.\nExample 1.

Since kmax = 4, there exist four dk at which a local minimum occurs. For the selected parameters, they are evaluated to d1 = 46.7 m, d2 = 21.6 m, d3 = 12.3 m, and d4 = 6.5 m. The corresponding received power from (3) is shown in Fig. 4. It can be seen that a minimum occurs at d = dk, with the lowest peak being at the smallest k, i.e., k = 1, which corresponds to the highest distance of all dk. For comparison, we additionally show the received power for f2 = 2.4 GHz in Fig. 4.\n2) Worst-Case Receive Power: When d is anywhere in the interval [dmin, dmax], the lowest peak is at the smallest k such that dk is still in [dmin, dmax]. However, in order to determine the global minimum of the receive power in [dmin, dmax], the boundary points dmin and dmax need to be taken into account. This leads to the following result of the minimal receive power when only a single frequency is used.\nTheorem 1 (Minimal Receive Power (Single Frequency)). Consider the described two-ray ground reflection model with a single frequency \u03c9 = 2\u03c0f . The distance d between transmitter and receiver is in the interval [dmin, dmax]. The minimal receive power is then given as\nmin d\u2208[dmin,dmax] Pr(d) =\nmin { Pr(dmin), Pr(dmax), Pr ( max\ndk\u2208[dmin,dmax] dk\n)} . (7)\nExample 2 (Single Frequency Worst-Case Receive Power). For a numerical example, we take the parameters that are used in Example 1 and additionally compare it to a higher frequency scenario. In particular, we fix hTx = 10 m, hRx = 1.5 m, and Pt = 1. The receiver is assumed to be randomly located at a distance between dmin = 30 m and dmax = 100 m from the transmitter.\nFor the lower frequency \u03c91 = 10c, i.e., f1 = 477 MHz, we get Pr(dmin, \u03c91) = \u221250 dB, Pr(dmax, \u03c91) = \u221260 dB, and Pr(d1(\u03c91), \u03c91) = \u221297 dB with d1(\u03c91) = 46.7 m. Based on (7) from Theorem 1, we determine that the worst-case receive power is equal to \u221297 dB.\nIn contrast, for a higher frequency f2 = 2.4 GHz, there are multiple local minima at locations dk, which lie in the interval [dmin, dmax]. According to (7), we need to determine the maximum of all dk \u2208 [dmin, dmax]. For the considered parameters, this is calculated to d3(\u03c92) = 79.4 m with Pr(d3(\u03c92), \u03c92) = \u2212125 dB. The received powers at the boundary points are evaluated to Pr(dmin, \u03c92) = \u221264 dB and Pr(dmax, \u03c92) = \u221275 dB. Hence, the worst-case receive power when using only frequency f2 is \u2212125 dB."

For a fair comparison with the single frequency case, we assume that the total transmit power Pt remains the same. Thus, only half of the transmit power is used for the individual frequencies. This leads to the expression for the total received power in (8) at the top of the next page.\nSince we are particularly interested in improving the worstcase performance, we will consider a lower bound on Ps in the following.\nLemma 1 (Lower Bound on the Sum Power for Two Frequencies). For the described two-ray ground reflection system using two frequencies \u03c91, \u03c92 in parallel, the received sum power Ps, is lower bounded by Ps from (9) at the top of the next page, where \u2206\u03c9 = \u03c92 \u2212 \u03c91 denotes the frequency spacing.\nProof.

It can clearly be seen that the lower bound is the lower envelope of the actual received power. Similar to the case that only a single frequency is used, the received power varies with the distance d and shows both minima and maxima. While the actual received power Ps oscillates at a high frequency over the distance d, the (spatial) frequency of the lower bound Ps is determined by the difference in frequencies \u2206f = \u2206\u03c9/(2\u03c0).\nThe drops in receive power occur at locations dk(\u2206\u03c9) which are calculated according to (6) to d1 = 22.9 m and d2 = 7.5 m. For the distance interval with dmin = 30 m and dmax = 100 m, the minimum receive power is determined by Theorem 2 to mind\u2208[dmin,dmax] Ps = \u221282.9 dB.

Each item i has a weight wi and each knapsack u has a weight capacity cu. When item i is placed in any knapsack, it yields the profit pi. In the QMKP, there additionally exist joint profits pij for placing items i and j in the same knapsack.\nThis basic setup closely resembles our considered problem of assigning frequencies to users. In particular, we have the following correspondences. The items to be assigned are the N available frequencies fi, i = 1, . . . , N . The knapsacks, which receive the items, correspond to the individual users U = {1, 2, . . . ,K}. Since we limit the number of frequencies that can be assigned to each user to two, we set the weight capacity cu of each user to cu = 2 and the weight of each frequency to wi = 1. The profit pi of assigning frequency fi to a user corresponds to the minimum receive power from (7). When adding a second frequency fj , the overall profit pi + pj + pij should equal the minimum receive power from (10). However, it needs to be emphasized that these profits are different for each user u, since the parameters [dmin,u, dmax,u] and hRx,u may vary between users.

However, since the standard formulation does not include heterogeneous profits, these algorithms do not support it. While generalizations to the QMKP exist, e.g., considering groups of items [28], [29], they are not directly applicable to our considered problem.\nTherefore, we introduce a novel generalization as quadratic multiple knapsack problem with heterogeneous profits (QMKPHP) in the following.\nProblem Statement 2 (Quadratic Multiple Knapsack Problem with Heterogeneous Profits (QMKP-HP)). Let F = {1, 2, . . . , N} be a set of items (or objects) and U = {1, 2, . . . ,K} be a set of knapsacks. Each item i \u2208 F has weight wi and can be assigned to at most one knapsack u \u2208 U . Each knapsack has a weight capacity cu. If item i is assigned to knapsack u, it yields the profit pu,i. Additionally, each pair of items i, j \u2208 F , i 6= j, has a joint profit pu,ij , if both items are assigned to the same knapsack u. The set Au \u2282 F describes the allocation of items to knapsack u.\nThe objective of the QMKP-HP is to find allocations A = {A1, . . . ,AK} such that the overall profit is maximized,\nmax \u2211 u\u2208U ( \u2211 i\u2208Au pu,i + \u2211 j\u2208Au j 6=i pu,ij ) (13a)\ns. t. \u2211 i\u2208Au wi \u2264 cu \u2200u \u2208 U (13b)\nK\u2211 u=1 aiu \u2264 1 \u2200 1 \u2264 i \u2264 N (13c)\nwhere aiu = 1 if item i is assigned to user u, i.e., if i \u2208 Au, and aiu = 0 otherwise.\nRemark 1. When the profits Pu of the individual knapsacks are all the same, i.e., P1 = P2 = \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 = PK , the QMKP-HP reduces to the standard QMKP.\nIn the following, we develop a greedy algorithm to solve Problem (13). The algorithm is inspired by the constructive procedure from [24] for the classical QMKP, cf. [24, Alg. 1].\nAs an essential guideline in the algorithm, we use the common notion of value density [24], [27]. This quantity describes the value of adding a particular item i to a knapsack u if it already has items S assigned to it, i.e.,\nvdu(i,S) = 1\nwi pu,i +\u2211 j\u2208S i 6=j pu,ij  . (14) For a more convenient notation, we define its matrix form as\nvd(S) =  vd1(1,S) vd2(1,S) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 vdK(1,S) vd1(2,S) vd2(2,S) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 vdK(2,S) ... ... . . . ...\nvd1(N,S) vd2(N,S) \u00b7 \u00b7 \u00b7 vdK(N,S)  . (15)\nAfter an initialization, the main idea of the proposed Algorithm 1 at the bottom of the next page is the following. We start with the combination of item i and knapsack u which yields the largest value density. If there is still room for item i in knapsack u, i.e., if wi \u2264 cu, we add the item to the knapsack. If there is no room for it, we proceed with the next best combination of item and knapsack, until we can assign an item\nto a knapsack. After an item has been assigned, it is removed from the list of unassigned items and the value densities for the remaining ones are updated. These steps are repeated until there are no more items to assign or all remaining items\u2019 weights exceed the remaining capacities of all knapsacks.\nRemark 2. Algorithm 1 can also be used to complete a partial solution A(0). We simply need to take A(0) into account while initializing the set of unassigned items. If no initial assignments exist, we set A(0) = \u2205."

The source code to reproduce all of the following results can be found at [30]. All simulations are run in Python on an off-the-shelf laptop computer with Intel i7-8565 CPU.\nWe compare different problem sizes with varying numbers of users K and frequencies N . For each setup, we uniformly select N frequencies in the interval 2.4 GHzto2.5 GHz. The height of the transmitter is fixed to hTx = 10 m. We then randomly generate K user parameters with hRx,u \u223c unif[1, 3]m, dmin,u \u223c unif[20, 40]m, and (dmax,u \u2212 dmin,u) \u223c unif[10, 100]m. While we assume N \u2265 2K in our examples, this is not necessary. However, in the case of N < 2K, not every user gets two frequencies assigned.\nTable II shows the performance of the proposed QMKP-HP approach for different problem sizes. The reported run times for Algorithm 1 are averages over 100 trials with minimum and maximum in parentheses. The last two columns indicate the achieved average worst-case receive powers, i.e., the objective of (4) divided by the number of users K. For comparison, we additionally evaluated the performance for a random frequency assignment and three round-robin (RR) schemes. The first one (RR-simple) starts by assigning user 1 f1, user 2 f2 and continues for each user. In a second round, each user gets assigned a second frequency, i.e., at the end, user u is assigned fu and fu+N . The second RR scheme (RR-block) is similar to the first one but assigns two frequencies to each user at once, i.e., user u gets frequencies f2u\u22121 and f2u. As a final comparison, we add a RR scheme that takes the user profits Pu into account (RR-profits). With this, the users take turns selecting the frequency that yields the highest profit for them.\nFrom the results in Table II, it can clearly be seen that the proposed algorithm consistently improves the average worst-case receive power by 5 dB to 6 dB over a random frequency assignment. Additionally, it can be run in feasible times on standard hardware, even for larger problem sizes of 100 frequency blocks and 45 users.\nIn comparison to the RR schemes, the proposed QMKPHP approach also shows gains in performance. The worst performance is found for RR-block, since each user is assigned neighboring frequencies, which does not effectively leverage the benefit of using two frequencies in parallel. The RRsimple scheme improves this in general. However, depending on the number of available frequencies and users, the assigned\nfrequencies can still be very close together. In contrast, the profit-aware RR algorithm achieves results close to the QMKPHP approach. However, there is still a gap of up to 2.8 dB, which is maximal in the case where N is close to 2K. In these scenarios it can happen in the RR scheme that users take frequencies before others, which would have yielded higher benefits for the overall system."

However, we are only interested in bounding the oscillating part of Ps given by the cosine terms as\ns = cos ( \u03c91 c ( \u02dc\u0300\u2212 `) )\n\u03c921 +\ncos ( \u03c92 c ( \u02dc\u0300\u2212 `) )\n\u03c922 .\nThe analytic function of s is given as s+js\u0302, where s\u0302 = H{s} is the Hilbert transform H of s. The envelope of s is then given as\nAlgorithm 1 Constructive procedure for solving the QMKP-HP from Problem Statement 2 1: Input: Items F , Users U , Profits P , Initial Assignments A(0) 2: Output: Final Assignments A 3: procedure CONSTRUCTIVEPROCEDURE(F , U , P , A(0)) 4: Initialize unassigned items S = F \\\u22c3uA(0)u // If there is no initial assignment, we have S = F 5: Initialize assignments Au = A(0)u , \u2200u \u2208 U // If there is no initial assignment, we have Au = \u2205 6: Calculate initial value densities V = vd(S) // According to (15) 7: repeat 8: V\u0304 = SORTDESCENDING(V ) // Sort V in descending order and store it in V\u0304 , i.e., maxViu = V\u03041 \u2265 V\u03042 \u2265 . . . 9: Initialize counter j = 1\n10: repeat 11: V\u0304j = Viu 12: if wi \u2264 cu then // There is enough space in knapsack u 13: Au = Au \u222a {i} // Assign element i to user u 14: S = S \\ {i} // Remove element i from set of unassigned items S 15: cu = cu \u2212 wi // Adjust the remaining capacity cu of knapsack u 16: else 17: j = j + 1 // Increase counter and proceed with value next in size 18: end if 19: until (An item is assigned to a user or j = |V\u0304 |) 20: Viu = vdu(i,Au), \u2200u \u2208 U , i \u2208 S // Update value densities for the remaining items 21: until (S = \u2205 or cu < wi, \u2200u \u2208 U , i \u2208 S) // All items are assigned or no more space in knapsacks 22: return A = {A1, . . . ,AK} 23: end procedure\n|s+ js\u0302|. With the correspondence H{cos(\u03c9t)} = sin(\u03c9t) [32], we obtain the analytic signal\ns+ js\u0302 = cos (\u03c91t)\n\u03c921 +\ncos (\u03c92t)\n\u03c922 + j\n( sin (\u03c91t)\n\u03c921 +\nsin (\u03c92t)\n\u03c922 ) where we use the shorthand t = \u02dc\u0300\u2212`c . The absolute value can then be calculated as\n|s+ js\u0302|2 = 1 \u03c941 + 1 \u03c942 + 2 cos ((\u03c92 \u2212 \u03c91)t) \u03c921\u03c9 2 2 .\nApplying the definitions of t and \u2206\u03c9 = \u03c92\u2212\u03c91 and substituting the envelope of s into (8), we obtain (9)."
