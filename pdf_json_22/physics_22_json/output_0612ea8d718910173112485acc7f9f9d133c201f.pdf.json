    "abstractText": "The interface exciplex system is a promising technology for reaching organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) with low turn-on voltages, high efficiencies and long lifetimes due to its unique virtue of barrier-free charge transport, well-confined recombination region, and thermally activated delayed fluorescence characteristics. In this review, we firstly illustrate the mechanism frameworks and superiorities of the interface exciplex system. We then summarize the primary applications of interface exciplex systems fabricated by doping and doping-free technologies. The operation mechanisms of these OLEDs are emphasized briefly. In addition, various novel strategies for further improving the performances of interface exciplex-based devices are demonstrated. We believe this review will give a promising perspective and attract researchers to further develop this technology",

            "text": "As global climate warming and energy shortages become aggravated, developing lighting technology with energy conservation and environmental protection becomes a significant world issue [1]. Organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs) have caught the attention of academia and industry due to their high performance, low power, and flexibility, which exhibit great potential for display and lighting applications [2\u20136]. In order to overcome the intrinsic low internal quantum efficiency (IQE) of fluorophores-based OLEDs, phosphorescent OLEDs are proposed as a promising technology due to their singlet and triplet harvesting properties [7]. These devices generate phosphorescence emission via the radiative transition process from T1 excited state to ground state S0, which can be enhanced by the intersystem crossing (ISC) process from S1 to T1 [8\u201310]. However, phosphorescent dyes are mostly organometallic complexes that contain heavy metal elements of platinum and iridium, increasing the manufacturing costs of commercialization [11]. In 2012, thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) materials were first reported by the Adachi group, and are regarded as new generation emitters by academia and industry [12,13]. Such materials have a small singlet\u2013triplet energy gap (\u2206EST), so that triplet excitons can be upconverted into singlet excitons via reverse intersystem crossing (RISC) at room temperature, thereby generating delayed fluorescence [14\u201316]. Unlike TADF material based on intramolecular charge transfer, the TADF process in exciplex should result from intermolecular charge transfer, which can noticeably improve the utilization of triplet excitons and enhance device efficiency [17,18]. Therefore, exciplexes can be employed as efficient TADF emitters or TADF hosts for dopants with satisfied charge transport properties. In general, exciplex architecture can be constructed by two strategies:\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 298. https://doi.org/10.3390/mi13020298 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/micromachines\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 298 2 of 22\n(i) mixing the donor material and the acceptor material into the same layer to form bulk exciplex [19]; (ii) separating the donor layer and the acceptor layer to generate exciplex at the interface [20]. Meanwhile, interface exciplex-type OLEDs exhibit many advantages, such as simplified device architectures and lower driving voltages [21,22]. Nowadays, efficient OLEDs based on exciplex are widely reported, and EQEs of over 20% are realized in interface exciplex-based devices [23]. In this review, we emphatically describe the progress of interface exciplex-based OLEDs. The operating mechanism of interface exciplex is first demonstrated, then the design strategies and applications of interface exciplex fabricated by doping and dopingfree technologies are summarized, including monochromatic and white OLEDs. Finally, an outlook for the improvement of interface exciplex-based OLED is proposed."

            "text": "Exciplex emission is a product of electron transition from the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital (LUMO) of acceptor (A) to the highest occupied molecular orbital (HOMO) of the donor (D) [24,25]. The charge transfer (CT) excited state formed between the donor and acceptor layer under photoexcitation can be described as follows [26]:\nD + A + h\u03bd\u2192 D* + A or D + A*\u2192 (D\u03b4+A\u03b4\u2212)*\u2192 h\u03bdex + D + A (1)\nThe emission peak of exciplex always exhibits a red shift compared with those of pure donor and acceptor [27\u201337], which can be expressed as follows [38]:\nh\u03bdmax \u223c= ID \u2212 AA \u2212 EC (2)\nwhere ID is the ionization potential of the donor, AA is the electron affinity of the acceptor, and EC is the coulombic attraction energy. Figure 1a shows the interface exciplex emission process in the EL process. Spin statistics demonstrate that the proportion of 1:3 of singlet excitons to triplet excitons can be generated by electron-hole recombination [39]. In general, a significant energy-level bias between the HOMO of the donor and the LUMO of the acceptor is more likely to provide a small \u2206EST [40]. As for exciplex, the HOMO and LUMO are separated between donor and acceptor molecules, resulting in a small energy gap between singlet level and triplet level [40,41]. A small \u2206EST is essential for exciplex to obtain TADF properties, because minor \u2206EST allows triplet excitons to be upconverted into singlet excitons under thermal excitation via RISC, leading to the efficient radiative transition of singlet excitons [42]. The RISC rate (kRISC) in the interface exciplex system can be expressed by the Arrhenius equation [43]:\nkRISC = Aexp ( \u2212\u2206EST\nkT\n) (3)\nwhere A is frequency factor, k is the boltzmann constant, and T is the temperature. It should be noted that higher kRISC can be achieved when \u2206EST is smaller than kT, which is approximately 26 meV at 300 K [43]. One must note that, owing to large energy level bias between HOMO of the donor and LUMO of the acceptor, the main recombination zone of charge carriers can be confined at the heterojunction [44]. Moreover, for achieving an efficient interface exciplex emitter, the triplet energy level (T1) of exciplex should be lower than either the donor or the acceptor, so that the reverse energy transfer from exciplex to constituent molecular can be prevented [45\u201348].\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 298 3 of 22\nMicromachines 2022, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 3 of 22 inevitable, especially at high current density [49]; (ii) the RISC rate is always lower than the ISC rate in the interface exciplex system, leading to the non-radiative transition processes of triplet excitons [50\u201352]. It is generally believed that using interface exciplex as an energy transfer host for dye is an effective way to improve the utilization of exciplex triplet excitons. Because the energy transfer process from exciplex to dopant is competitive with the energy-loss pathways [51], an efficient energy transfer process can effectively guard against the waste of interface exciplex triplet excitons. For serving as a host, the T1 of the exciplex should be higher than that of the dopants to prevent reverse energy transfer. Furthermore, the emission spectrum of exciplex should overlap well with the absorption spectrum of the emitter to achieve efficient energy transfer. The expression of energy transfer efficiency (\u03a6ET) is [52]: \u03a6ET = kex-g kr + knr + kex-g = kex-g( ) ex-g (4) where kex-g is the energy transfer rate from the host of exciplex to the emitter, kr is the radiative decay rate of exciplex, knr is the non-radiative decay rate of exciplex, and \ud835\udf0f is the delay time of exciplex. As can been seen, higher \u03a6ET can be reached with improved \ud835\udf0f.\nThe energy transfer process in OLEDs based on interface exciplex is shown in Figure 1b. For doping-free OLEDs, the emission layer (EML) and the interface of exciplex are separated by the interlayer so that the short-range Dexter excitation transfer (DET) from exciplex to EML will be hindered. The unutilized triplet excitons can be upconverted into singlet excitons via an effective RISC process, and then the long-range F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET) can be enhanced, thereby improving the energy transfer to the EML [53,54]. As for doped OLEDs, the energy transfer from interface exciplex to dopant is greatly affected by the doping concentration [46,55]. Increasing doping concentration can improve the device efficiency in a reasonable concentration range [56]. However, with doping concentration increasing, the distance between interface exciplex and dopant reduces so that more triplet excitons can transfer energy to the dopant via DET, resulting in the energy loss of triplet excitons [57]. Consequently, an accurate control doping level in the preparation process is essential for efficient and stable energy transfer.\nFigure 1. (a) Diagram of interface exciplex emission.

            "text": "Monochromatic OLEDs can be achieved by individual interface exciplex or an additional emitter. Although it was mentioned in earlier reports that exciplex formations are unfavorable for the efficiency of devices [72], the EQEs of recently reported OLEDs based on exciplex emission exceeded 5% due to the excellent TADF property of exciplexes [73\u201375]. Hung et al. first reported a simplified yellow exciplex OLED in 2013. As shown in Figure 2a, by employing 4,4\u2032,4\u2032\u2032-tri(N-carbazolyl)triphenylamine (TCTA) and 2,4,6-tris(3-(1H-pyrazol1-yl)phenyl)-1,3,5-triazine (3P-T2T) as donor and acceptor, respectively, a bilayer structure EML is established, as shown in Figure 2b. Meanwhile, TCTA and 3P-T2T act as a hole transport layer (HTL) and electron transport layer (ETL), respectively [76]. Owing to the excellent charge transport mobilities of the two materials, charge carriers of holes and electrons can reach the donor/acceptor interface without limitation, leading to efficient exciton recombination [77]. The resulting device achieves a maximum CE, PE, and EQE of 22.5 cd/A, 23.6 lm/W, and 7.7%, respectively, along with a low turn-on voltage of 2 V.

            "text": "Mo ochromatic OLEDs can be achieved by individual interface exciplex or an additional emitter. Although it was mentioned in earlier reports that exciplex formations are unfavorable for the efficiency of devices [72], the EQEs of recently reported OLEDs based on exciplex emission exceeded 5% due to the excellent TADF property of exciplexes [73\u2013 75]. Hung et al. first reported a simplified yellow exciplex OLED in 2013. As shown in Figure 2a, by employing 4,4\u2032,4\u2033-tri(N-carbazolyl)triphenylamine (TCTA) and 2,4,6-tris(3(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)phenyl)-1,3,5-triazine (3P-T2T) as donor and acceptor, respectively, a bilayer structure EML is established, as shown in Figure 2b. Meanwhile, TCTA and 3P-T2T act as a hole transport layer (HTL) and electron transport layer (ETL), respectively [76]. Owing to the excellent charge tra sport mobilities of the two materials, charge carriers of hol s and electrons can reach the don r/accept r interface without limitation, leading to fficient exciton recombination [77]. The r sulting device achieves a maximum CE, PE, and EQE of 22.5 cd/A, 23.6 lm/W, and 7.7%, resp ctively, along with a low turn-on voltage f V. Because exciplex excitons are confined around the interface of the bilayer because of the relat ve higher T1s of the donor and acc ptor, efficient trip et exciton harvest can occur via the RICS process, which is the principal cause of he igh performance of t device. Thi ork provides a simplified model of OLEDs bas d on interface exciplex, which suggests that the interface exciplex could be formed by the befittin combination of donor-acceptor pairs.\nFigure 2. (a) Diagram of the TCTA and 3P-T2T molecular structures. (b) Diagram of the device structure with TCTA/3P-T2T exciplex emission [76].\nFurthermore, combining interface exciplex with ultrathin layer technology is another promising approach to achieving doping-free OLED [78]. By using complete energy transfer processes, which depend on the high overlapping between the absorption spectra of dyes and the exciplexes emission spectra, efficient utilization of excitons can be anticipated in ultrathin-layer-based devices [79,80]. In 2017, Xu et al. developed a green-emitting phosphorescent OLED based on an ultrathin emission layer (UEML) of 0.8 nm thick Bis[2-(2-pyridinyl-N)phenyl-C](acetylacetonato)iridium(III) (Ir(ppy)2acac). By inserting the UMEL into the interface of 1,1- Bis[(di-4-tolylamino)phenyl]cyclohexane (TAPC) and 1,3,5-tri(p-pyrid-3-ylphenyl)benzene (TmPyPB), a maximum EQE of 17.97% and CE of 66.2 cd/A were shown in the device. The PL spectra of constituent molecules and exciplex are shown in Figure 3. By further introducing a charge-generating unit (CGU) of Bathophenanthroline (Bphen): LiNH2/HAT-CN, a highly efficient green OLED based on the tandem structure can be constructed, achieving an increased CE of 135.74 cd/A and EQE of 36.85%. The superior performance can be attributed to the following: (i) exciplex formed at the TAPC/TmPyPB\nFigure 2. (a) Diagram of the TCTA and 3P-T2T molecular structures.

Doping-Free WOLEDs Generally, interface-exciplex WOLEDs with a doping-free structure can be achieved by employing complementary emissions (blue and orange) or trichromatic emissions (blue, green, red) [82,83]. It is well-known that the health lighting source should have a high-color rendering index (CRI), which is easily improved by introducing an interface exciplex emission due to its broad spectrum composition [84,85]. Sych et al. fabricated an A/D\u2013A/D type WOLEDs by using doping-free technology with sandwich structures of m-MTDATA/pCzPPQ or mCzPPQ/PO-T2T, where mMTDATA is 4,4\u2032,4\u2033-tris[3-methylphenyl(phenyl)amino]triphenylamine, pCzPPQ is 9-(4- (4-Phenylquinolin-2-yl)phenyl)-9H-carbazole, mCzPPQ is 9-(3-(4-Phenylquinolin-2yl)phenyl)-9H-carbazole, and PO-T2T is 2,4,6-tris[3-(diphenylphosphinyl)phenyl]-1,3,5triazine [86]. Meanwhile, D\u2013A-type materials of pCzPPQ and mCzPPQ, which are the isomers of 9-phenylcarbazole and quinolone, are synthesized by Friedlander condensation and then the Ullmann cross-coupling reaction, as shown in Figure 4a. Therefore, blue and orange emissions can be formed at the dual interfaces of m-MTDATA/pCzPPQ (mCzPPQ) and pCzPPQ (mCzPPQ)/PO-T2T without extra donor layers, as shown in Figure 4b. Furthermore, color temperature can be easily recorded by modifying the thickness of the D\u2013 A functional system. The optimized all-exciplex-based device achieves a maximum EQE of 3.15% and a high CRI of 76. Recently, Wei et al. adopted a novel approach to construct an all-exciplex-based WOLEDs where white emission were formed from the same donor interface by parallelly depositing acceptor materials of TPBi and PO-T2T on the same donor layer of TAPC in a vertical direction. The device contains a unique interface exciplex architecture of TAPC (40 nm)/TBPi (10 nm) PO-T2T (10 nm), achieving a maximum CE of 3.17 cd/A with a high CRI of 71. By using this technology, simplified WOLEDs can be constructed by exciplex emission without elaborate molecule design engineering, leading to a reduced preparation complexity of WOLEDs [87]."

(b) The sandwich structure of m-MTDATA/mCzPPQ or pCzPPQ/PO-T2T [86].\nThe further improvements of efficiency of doping-free WOLEDs can be reached by introducing energy transfer processes from exciplexes to additional emission layers [88]. By employing high energy-state interface exciplex of 26DCzPPy/PO-T2T, Ying et al. realized high-efficiency doping-free WOLEDs using UEML. The main architectures of those WOLEDs are Ir(tptpy)2acac (0.1 nm)/26DczPPy (x nm)/FIrPic (0.3 nm)/PO-T2T, where Ir(tptpy)2acac is Iridium(III) bis(4-(4-t-butyl-phenyl)thieno[3,2-c]pyridinato-N,C2)acetylacetonate, bipolar 26DCzPPy is 2,6-bis(3-(carbazol-9-yl)phenyl)pyridine, and FIrPic is Iridium(III) bis[(4,6-difluorophenyl)-pyridinato-N,C2\u2032]picolinate[89]. Under the scenario without the 26DczPPy layer, a weak blue emission and an intense orange emission will be generated from the FIrPic and Ir(tptpy)2acac, respectively, because the Ir(tptpy)2acac harvests most of the excitons of the low energy-state TCTA/PO-T2T interface exciplex. As the thickness of 26DCzPPy increases to 2 nm, the TCTA/PO-T2T exciplex formation is inhibited by the high energy-state 26DCzPPy/PO-T2T interface exciplex. The excitons energy of exciplex can be effectively transferred to Ir(tptpy)2acac and FIrPic, resulting in an EQE of 19.7%. Furthermore, devices achieve the correlated color temperature (CCT) with an adjustable range of 2878~9895 K by changing the thickness of the 26DCzPPy layer, which suggests that the energy transfer from interface exciplex to EMLs can be easily controlled. However, full phosphorescent emitters always suffer from serious efficiency roll-off, although high efficiencies can be realized [90]. Fluorescence/phosphorescence hybrid WOLEDs have been proven to be a qualified approach to solve the problem. By introducing blue interface exciplex emission, Liu\u2019s group realized doping-free WOLED without using additional blue emitters [91]. The m-MTDATA/3-(4-Biphenyl)-4-phenyl-5-tert-butylphenyl-1,2,4-triazole (TAZ) exciplex generates blue emissions and can excites orange phosphor of bis(2-(9,9-diethyl-9H-fluoren-2-yl)-1-phenyl-1Hbenzoimidazole-N,C3)iridium (acetylacetonate) [(fbi)2Ir(acac)] due to the higher T1. The energy transfer process from exciplex to the (fbi)2Ir(acac) can be adjusted by controlling the thickness of m-MTDATA in the m-MTDATA/TAZ interface exciplex forming system, and the balance between orange and blue emissions is achieved with 6 nm thick m-MTDATA. The resulting device achieves CRI of 81, which is one of the highest CRIs of the WOLEDs based on a singleemitter structure. By replacing (fbi)2Ir(acac) with the yellow phosphor of Ir(dmppy)2(dpp), the device achieves an EQE of 9.9%. Moreover, three-color WOLED is constructed by further employing additional red phosphor, achieving CRI and CCT of 85 and 2376 K, respectively. Furthermore, the same group proposed another strategy to fabricate hybrid WOLEDs constructed by an exciplex/electroplex system and ultrathin emission layers [92]. The blue emission is generated by the combination of exciplex and electroplex, leading to broad EL spectra. The TAPC/TmPyPB interface exciplex and electroplex show peaks of 425 nm and 468 nm simultaneously under electric excitation. Therefore, a broader peak width at half maximum of the blue emissions can be furnished. As shown in Figure\nFigure 4. (a) Diagram of the molecular structures of PO-T2T, pCzPPQ, mCzPPQ, and m-MTDATA.

Similarly, this mechanism is also applied to the blue emission unit, as shown in Figure 7.

            "text": "Understanding exciton behavior is beneficial for manipulating excitons due to the different energy transfer paths between singlet and triplet excitons. For instance, the FRET from S1 of exciplex to dopant can be enhanced by the RISC process, weakening the DET between triplet excitons by augmenting the energy transfer distance; this means excitons become easy to manipulate by using interface exciplex. In the second half of this section, we will introduce several novel methods, including ternary exciplexes and applications of phosphor/TADF sensitization effects in interface exciplex devices Kim et al. fabricated green-emitting phosphorescent OLEDs by doping fac-tris(2-phenyl-pyridine)iridium [Ir(ppy)3] into the donor layer of an N,N\u2032-dicarbazolyl-4-4\u2032-biphenyl (CBP)/ bis-4,6-(3,5-di-3-pyridylphenyl)-2-methylpyrimidine (B3PYMPM) interface exciplex system [56]. The device efficiency increased with the doping concentration of Ir(ppy)3, which can be ascribed to the enhanced energy transfer efficiency from CBP/B3PYMPM exciplex to the Ir(ppy)3. The maximum EQE of the device was 20.1% with an Ir(ppy)3 doping concentration of 6%. By inserting an undoped CBP layer between the emission layer and the acceptor layer, the efficiency reduces as the thickness of the pure CBP layer rises, suggesting that the exciplex triplet excitons transfer is hindered, which can be explained by the fact that triplet exciton transferring is a short-range process. By comparing the performance between an interface exciplex device and a bulk-exciplex device, Wang et al. drew the following conclusions: (i) the interface exciplex-based device shows a turn-on voltage of 2.36 V, which is lower than that of the bulk exciplexbased device because of the barrier-free electron-hole recombination; (ii) the interface exciplex-based device reaches a high PE of 97.2 lm/W, which is almost three times than that of the bulk exciplex-based device due to the elimination of charge traps of dye [96].

            "text": "Understanding exciton behavior is beneficial for manipulating excitons due to the different energy transfer paths between singlet and triplet excitons. For instance, the FRET from S1 of exciplex to dopant can be enhanced by the RISC process, weakening the DET between triplet excitons by augmenting the energy transfer distance; this means excitons become easy to manipulate by using interface exciplex. In the second half of this section, we will introduce several novel methods, including ternary exciplexes and applications of phosphor/TADF sensitization effects in interface exciplex devices Kim et al. fabricated green-emitting phosphorescent OLEDs by doping fac-tris(2phenyl-pyridine)iridium [Ir(ppy)3] into the donor layer of an N,N\u2032-dicarbazolyl-4-4\u2032biphenyl (CBP)/bis-4,6-(3,5-di-3-pyridylphenyl)-2-methylpyrimidine (B3PYMPM) interface exciplex system [56]. The device efficiency increased with the doping concentration of Ir(ppy)3, which can be ascribed to the enhanced energy transfer efficiency from CBP/B3PYMPM exciplex to the Ir(ppy)3. The maximum EQE of the device was 20.1% with an Ir(ppy)3 doping concentration of 6%. By inserting an undoped CBP layer between the emission layer and the acceptor layer, the efficiency reduces as the thickness of the pure CBP layer rises, suggesting that the exciplex triplet excitons transfer is hindered, which can be explained by the fact that triplet exciton transferring is a short-range process. By comparing the performance between an interface exciplex device and a bulkexciplex device, Wang et al. drew the following conclusions: (i) the interface exciplexbased device shows a turn-on voltag of 2.36 V, which is low r than th t of the bulk exciplex-bas d device because of the barrier-free electron-hol recombination; (ii) the interface exciplex-based devic reaches a high PE of 97.2 lm/W, whic is almost three tim s than that of th bulk excipl x-based device due to the elimination of charge traps of dye [96]. By employing a homemade material of 9-(4\u2032-(4,6-diphenyl1,3,5-triazin-2-yl)[1,1\u2032-biphenyl]-3-yl)-9H-carbazol (o-DTPPC) as an accept r to form TADF exciplex with TAPC, Duan et al. constructed a red-emitting phosphorescent OLED by interface exciplex architecture of TAPC/o-DTPPC: Ir(mphmq)2tmd, where Ir(mphmq)2tmd is (bis(4-methyl2-(3,5-dimethylphenyl)quinoline))Ir(III)(tetramethylheptadionate) [53]. Owing to the small \u2206EST, the up-conversion from the triplet excitons of TAPC/o-DTPPC exciplex to singlet\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 298 9 of 22\nexcitons via RISC can occur, leading to the enhanced FRET process from exciplex to red phosphor of Ir(mphmq)2tmd. Therefore, an efficient phosphorescent OLED is realized, achieving an EQE of 21.01%. Generally, the unrecombined holes accumulated at the donor/acceptor interface could be a source of the degradation of the device [97]. By using a 5 nm thick emission layer, Colella et al. fabricated a red OLED by interface exciplex architecture of 26DCzPPy: 4% Ir(dmpq)2acac (5 nm)/PO-T2T, where Ir(dmpq)2acac is bis(2-(3,5-dimethylphenyl)quinolineC2,N\u2032)(acetylacetonato)-iridium(III), achieving a maximum EQE of 28.6%, along with increased lifetime [98]. The key reason for the superior performance is that the carrier recombination region is restrained to the 5 nm thick EML due to efficient F\u00f6rster and Dexter energy transfer, resulting in a reduced concentration of excitons piled up at the heterojunction. By comparison, the devices without TADF systems exhibit declined performances and additional emissions from host materials at high voltage, which can be attributed to the broader exciton recombination regions in those devices. In the course of application studies of OLEDs, reaching high-efficiency blue phosphorescent OLEDs with low driving voltages is still a challenge because it is hard to develop host materials with low singlet energy and high triplet energy [99\u2013103]. Kido et al. demonstrated high performance blue-emitting phosphorescent OLEDs by doping FIrPic into the acceptor of 5\u2032,5\u2032 \u2032 \u2032 \u2032-sulfonyl-di-1,1\u2032:3\u2032,1\u2032 \u2032-terphenyl (BTPS), giving a PE of 50.1 lm/W and turn-on voltage of 2.5 V [77]. The excitons behavior is also studied by inserting an undoped BTPS layer (0~10 nm) into the TAPC/BTPS interface. The singlet excitons of TAPC/BTPS exciplex can be harvested by FIrPic via FRET when the thickness of the undoped BTPS is less than 5 nm, which is the main reason for high efficiency. In contrast, as the thickness of undoped BTPS increases to 10 nm, the device shows an efficiency decline, owing to the decrease of FRET efficiency. Full fluorescent OLEDs are reported for pursuing low-cost and high-stability OLEDs [40,104]. However, fluorescent OLEDs based on conventional hosts always suffer from low EQEs owing to efficient DET from the T1 of hosts to the T1 of fluorophores [105,106]. The employment of interface exciplex is proposed to break this bottleneck because the DET from exciplex to fluorescent dopant is expected to be restricted due to the TADF properties of the interface exciplex. Moreover, direct exciton recombination on fluorescent dopants could be suppressed in interface exciplex systems, leading to decreased non-radiative transitions of triplet excitons. Zhao et al. designed a fluorescent OLED by doping (5,6,11,12)-tetraphenyl-naphthacene (rubrene) into the interface exciplex system [55]. The absorption spectrum of rubrene overlaps well with the emission spectrum of the TCTA/3P-T2T exciplex, leading to an enhanced FRET process from exciplex to rubrene. Thanks to the TADF properties of the TCTA/3P-T2T interface exciplex, an efficient fluorescent OLED is realized, achieving an EQE of 8.1%. It is noteworthy that the doping concentration of rubrene in the device is as low as 1.5%. Thus, the DET process from triplet excitons of exciplex to triplet excitons of rubrene is inhibited, significantly reducing the waste of triplet excitons. By doping TADF polymer emitter PAPTC into the donor layer, Lin et al. developed a green-emitting OLED with the interface exciplex of TAPC/TmPyPB, obtaining a higher PL quantum yield than pure PAPTC, which can be attributed to the restrained aggregation effects of PAPTC polymer chains because the doping into TAPC provides a broad distribution area for PAPTC. Furthermore, thanks to the high kRISC of 1.48 \u00d7 107 s\u22121 of the TAPC: PAPTC/TmPyPB exciplex system, a high-efficiency polymer electroluminescence OLED is constructed, achieving an EQE of 14.7% [107]. After deep and extensive research into doping technology [108\u2013113], various novel strategies have been proposed to further improve the performances of interface exciplexbased devices. By adopting the strategy of synergistic sensitization using phosphor and interface exciplex, Chen et al. developed a green-emitting fluorescent OLED based on the ultrathin fluorescent emission layer, as shown in Figure 8. The 2,3,6,7-tetrahydro-1,1,7,7,tetramethyl-1H,5H,11H-10-(2-benzothiazolyl)quinolizino-[9,9a,1gh]coumarin (C545T) can harvests excitons by two channels: Firstly, the N,N\u2032-dicarbazolyl-3,5-benzene (mCP)/B3PY\nMicromachines 2022, 13, 298 10 of 22\nMPM exciplex possesses TADF properties, leading to the enhanced FRET process from exciplex to C545T. On the other hand, the exciplex excitons can be harvested by Ir(ppy)3, then the singlet and triplet excitons of Ir(ppy)3 transfer energy to C545T via FRET, as shown in Figure 9, which is efficient due to the approximate T1 between Ir(ppy)3 (2.4 eV) and C545T (2.34 eV). Moreover, the DET process from exciplex to C545T is well eliminated by employing Ir(ppy)3 as a sensitizer. Because the exciton utilization of exciplex is improved due to multiple efficient FRET processes, an efficient fluorescent device is constructed, achieving an EQE of 8.1% [114].\nMicromachines 2022, 13, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 22\nAfter deep and extensive research into doping technology [108\u2013113], various novel strategies have been proposed to further improve the performances of interface exciplexbased devices.

            "text": "Combining interface exciplex with doping technology, doped WOLEDs can simultaneously reach high efficiencies and low driving voltages while maintaining simple device structures. The EL performances of WOLEDs based on interface exciplex are summarized in Table 2. Recently, our group developed highly efficient phosphorescence WOLEDs by codoping a complementary emitter into an acceptor of 4,6-bis(3,5-di(pyridin-4-yl)phenyl)2-phenylpyrimidine (B4PyPPM) (shown in Figure 12a) [123]. A novel interfacial exciplex system 26DCzPPy/B4PyPPM was used to build white OLEDs based on the single-emissionlayer structure, achieving efficiencies of 101.9 lm/W and 81.1 cd/A, along with a low turn-on voltage of 2.4 V, which is one of the best values in WOLEDs based on simplified architecture, as shown in Figure 12b. The enhanced performance could be attributed to the reduced energy loss of triplet excitons in the host through efficient FRET between the exciplex and the dopants, and the DET energy transfer process between the blue and orange dopants is suppressed due to the low doping concentration of orange dye. Additionally, a single-emission-layer white OLED based on an interface exciplex system only requires the doping of three materials simultaneously, with no need for high-performance host materials, providing a promising method to design simplified white OLEDs with high performance for commercial solid-state lighting and display. Gao et al. reported a high-efficiency and color-stable hybrid WOLED, as shown in Figure 13 [124]. By investigating PL and charge transport properties, the author demonstrates direct electron-hole recombination on a blue TADF fluorophore of 4,5-bis(carbazol-9yl)-1,2-dicyanobenzene (2CzPN), which was well restrained, so that the blue emission from 2CzPN was mainly generated from the energy transfer from the mCP/B3PYMPM interface exciplex.

By manipulating excitons with CDBP/B4PyPPM interface exciplex, Wang et al. constructed color-stable solution-processed WOLED [125].

The energy transfer process from exciplex to TXOTPA is shown in Figure 14. Note that the CDBP/B4PyPPM exciplex and TXO-TAP have no direct contact because of the 3.5 nm-thick CDBP, resulting in the DET process from blue exciplex to TXO-TPA being well suppressed.

            "text": "In this review paper, the basic concepts and applications of interface exciplex are demonstrated. Interface exciplex is the charge transfer state formed by donor and acceptor molecules at the donor/acceptor interface, which can be used as an emitter or energy transfer host. The success of interface exciplex as an emitter relies on an efficient RISC process, which improves the fluorescence quantum yield. Therefore, the EQE of OLED based on exciplex emission can exceed 5%. Moreover, introducing the energy transfer process between exciplex and dopant is an effective approach to further improve the efficiency of interface exciplex-based devices, achieving low turn-on voltage and inhibiting direct electron-hole recombination on the dopant. However, the interface exciplex system is still faced with problems such as serious triplet exciton quenching owing to a narrow distribution area and unfavorable fluorescence quantum efficiency because of low RISC rate. Despite providing a broad exciton recombination zone by adopting the long-range coupling CT excited states strategy, the EQE of a device with a D/S/A structure is far below a device with D/A interface exciplex. For now, improving the efficiency of the RISC is the most feasible and practical solution to those problems. Therefore, further studies are necessary to investigate the radiative transition process in interface exciplex, and novel interface exciplex systems with a high-fluorescence quantum yield still need to be developed to accelerate the commercialization process of interface exciplex-based devices.\nAuthor Contributions: Writing, J.S., R.S. and P.C.; review and editing, C.C., W.Z. and E.Z.; validation, W.M. and Y.S.
