    "abstractText": "The Earth rotation parameters (ERPs), including polar motion (PMX and PMY) and universal time (UT1-UTC), play a central role in functions such as monitoring the Earth\u2019s rotation and high-precision navigation and positioning. Variations in ERPs reflect not only the overall state of movement of the Earth, but also the interactions among the atmosphere, ocean, and land on the spatial and temporal scales. In this paper, we estimated ERP series based on very long baseline interferometry (VLBI) observations between 2011\u20132020. The results show that the average root mean square errors (RMSEs) are 0.187 mas for PMX, 0.205 mas for PMY, and 0.022 ms for UT1-UTC. Furthermore, to explore the high-frequency variations in more detail, we analyzed the polar motion time series spectrum based on fast Fourier transform (FFT), and our findings show that the Chandler motion was approximately 426 days and that the annual motion was about 360 days. In addition, the results also validate the presence of a weaker retrograde oscillation with an amplitude of about 3.5 mas. This paper proposes a hybrid prediction model that combines convolutional neural network (CNN) and long short-term memory (LSTM) neural network: the CNN\u2013LSTM model. The advantages can be attributed to the CNN\u2019s ability to extract and optimize features related to polar motion series, and the LSTM\u2019s ability to make mediumto long-term predictions based on historical time series. Compared with Bulletin A, the prediction accuracies of PMX and PMY are improved by 42% and 13%, respectively. Notably, the hybrid CNN\u2013LSTM model can effectively improve the accuracy of mediumand long-term polar motion prediction.",

            "text": "Earth rotation parameters (ERPs) are the key conversion parameters connecting the international terrestrial reference frame (ITRF) and international celestial reference frame (ICRF) and can be divided into two parts: (1) those that describe variations in the Earth\u2019s rotation rate, i.e., universal time (UT1-UTC) or length of day (LOD); (2) and those that monitor variations in the position of the Earth\u2019s axis, i.e., polar motion (PMX, PMY) [1,2]. With the rapid development of space geodetic techniques, more techniques are being applied to monitor variations in the Earth\u2019s rotation, such as the global navigation satellite system (GNSS (Toulouse, France)), very long baseline interferometry (VLBI (National Astronomical Observatory of Japan, Tokyo, Japan)), satellite laser ranging (SLR), lunar laser ranging (LLR), and doppler orbitography and radio positioning integrated by satellite (DORIS) [3\u20135]. The Earth\u2019s rotation not only represents the state of its overall movement, but also reflects the interactions and mechanical processes between the solid earth and the atmosphere, ocean, mantle, and crust on the temporal and spatial scale [6]. Therefore, variations in ERPs indicate variations in various geophysical factors. The highly accurate determination and estimation of ERPs with high precision and resolution has great reference value for\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 427. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15020427 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 427 2 of 17\nexploring not only the activities of the Earth, Sun, and Moon, but also can explore the law of material movement in the Earth\u2019s interior [7,8]. The research on ERP estimation has been conducted by many scholars mainly based on GNSS, VLBI, SLR, and other techniques. For polar motion estimation, the results of this study indicate that GNSS occasionally has superior accuracy, which is due to the large number of International GNSS Service (IGS) stations homogeneously distributed around the globe, as discovered by Dow and Neilan [9]. B\u00f6hm et al. [8] proposed a method, operated in time domain, that is easily applicable to ERP estimation from VLBI. Accurate UT1-UTC results allow detailed studies of geodynamic phenomena and probing of excitations [10]. Brzezinski et al. [11] reported that diurnal and semi-diurnal atmospheric effects on ERP, polar motion, and variations in LOD were below 10 \u00b5as and 10 \u00b5s, respectively. In addition, the International VLBI Service for Geodesy and Astrometry (IVS) has organized a 2-week continuous VLBI campaign (CONT) every third year since 2002 [12]. The observations from these campaigns have been used in many studies with different objectives, comparing the accuracy of GNSS and VLBI to estimate Earth orientation parameters (EOP) [13]. Using CONT17 observations, Puente [14] compared the accuracy of GNSS- and VLBI-estimated troposphere, station coordinates, zenith total delays (ZTDs), and gradients. The demand for real-time ERPs is growing due to space navigation and positioning; however, obtaining real-time ERP is more difficult due to the complex data processing [15]; for example, GPS processing takes about 3 h, while VLBI and SLR take longer to process. Various prediction methods are applied in ERP research. Table 1 indicates the prediction accuracy of the latest PM and UT1-UTC over various spans provided by the IERS (IERS Rapid Service/Prediction Centre). Based on least squares (LS), Kosek et al. [16] proposed a combined LS and autoregressive (AR) model for ERP prediction. Atmospheric angular momentum (AAM) prediction data are considered to be beneficial to improve the forecast accuracy of UT1 and LOD [4]. Schuh et al. [17] reported on incorporating artificial neural networks (ANN) into PM and UT1-UTC predictions. Furthermore, fuzzy inference system [15], multi-channel singular spectrum analysis (MSSA) [18], neural ordinary differential equations (ODE) differential learning [19], and fuzzy-wavelet [20] have been applied to ERP prediction.\nRegarding the possible causes of ERP prediction errors, the effect of El Ni\u00f1o on the prediction of polar motion must be taken into account [21]. Considering the axial component of atmospheric angular momentum (AAMX3 ), a combined multivariate autoregressive (MAR) model forecasting method was proposed by Niedzielski [22]. Chin et al. [23] investigated the short-term prediction of the polar motion by introducing a prediction model with an excitation function. It involved incorporating integrations of AAM estimates into UT1 series, as reported in a study by Gambis [24]. Long-term predictions of polar motion take into account the instantaneous frequency, phase, and amplitude of the Chandler motions, prograde, and retrograde annual motions of the Earth, and also the normal wavelet transform (NTFT), as reported by Su [25]. In addition, hybrid neural networks, which have drawn more attention recently, combine the advantages of different neural networks. Several previous studies combined convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory (CNN\u2013LSTM) to address temporal and spatial relations, respectively [26]. CNN can extract and optimize trend\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 427 3 of 17\nfeatures for different time series [27], while LSTM is specifically designed to make longterm predictions based on historical time series [28]. Augmenting fully CNN\u2013LSTM sub-modules for time series classification was proposed by Karim [29]. An attention-based CNN\u2013LSTM model to predict collaborations between different research institutions was reported by Zhou [30]. The aim of this paper was to estimate ERP based on VLBI observations from 2011 to 2020 and predict polar motion series based on the hybrid CNN\u2013LSTM model, the experiments of this paper can be described as follows:\n\u2022 VLBI observations from 2011 to 2020 were estimated by Vienna VLBI Software 3.2 (VieVS 3.2) [31,32] to obtain 10-year ERP time series. Furthermore, in order to compare the difference in ERP accuracy between other VLBI solutions, we estimated the observations of the CONT08, CONT11, CONT14, and CONT17 campaigns. To further explore high-frequency variations and investigate long-term series information of polar motion, fast Fourier transform (FFT) was used for the spectral analysis of polar motion series; \u2022 The LS + AR model is currently one of the more accurate models for short-term polar motion series prediction; however, it is less effective in medium- and long-term prediction. This experiment aims to resolve the problem that the existing methods are not effective for the medium- and long-term prediction of polar motion series and the inadequate modelling capabilities of various influencing factors. In this paper, a hybrid CNN\u2013LSTM model to predict polar motion is proposed by this paper; the CNN model can effectively extract features that affect polar motion series, and the LSTM model has natural advantages in the medium- and long-term time series prediction. To compare the differences in prediction accuracy, we also construct the LS + AR models for polar motion prediction based on Earth orientation parameters prediction comparison campaign (EOP PCC) [1,33]."

We noted that the average RMSE based on the IVS-R1/R4 solution was 0.187 mas and 0.205 mas for PMX and PMY respectively, while the average RMSE for UT1-UTC was 0.022 ms. Comparing the ERP series from different IVS analysis centers, the accuracy of polar motion and UT1-UTC\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 427 5 of 17\nsolutions based on the IVS-R1/R4 solution are at the same level. Furthermore, we found that the average RMSE based on the CONT solution is on the level of 0.03\u20130.05 mas for PM and 0.005\u20130.01 ms for UT1-UTC. One possible explanation for this might be that the typical IVS-R1/R4 sessions involve fewer stations (5\u201310 VLBI stations) and use a lower data recording rate (256 Mbit/s) rather than the faster 512 Mbit/s data recording rate. Another possible explanation for this is that the accuracy of ERP estimation depends on epoch continuity and the observations of the surrounding epochs also help to improve the estimation accuracy.\nFigure 2 shows a plot of ERP series estimated VLBI observations from 2011 to 2020 based on IVS-R1/R4 solutions. During 2011\u20132020, IVS conducted 1030 regular R1/R4 periodic observations. We noted that a small number of residual ERPs show significant fluctuations, and these results can be attributed to the small number of missing values, which make the interpolation method unsatisfactory."

LS Model\nTo investigate the accuracy of the LS + AR model for predicting polar motion, it is necessary to separate the periodic and trend terms based on the LS method, considering that the polar motion series have mixed periodic and trend terms. The LS model is written as follows [16]:\nX(t) = a + bt + k\n\u2211 i=1 ci cos( 2\u03c0t pi + \u03c9i) + di sin( 2\u03c0t pi + \u03c9i) (13)\nwhere X(t) is the polar motion series; a is a constant term; b is a linear term; ci and di are the coefficients for periodic terms; pi is the corresponding periodic; k is the number of periodic terms; and \u03c9i is the phase of each periodic term. The specific solution of the polar motion series of the LS model can be summarized as follows:\nX = [ a b c1 c2 d1 d2 . . . ] (14)\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 427 9 of 17\nB =  1 t1 cos 2\u03c0t1 p1 sin 2\u03c0t1p1 . . . 1 t2 cos 2\u03c0t2 p2 sin 2\u03c0t2p2 . . .\n. . . 1 tn cos 2\u03c0tnpn sin 2\u03c0tn pn . . .

AR Model\nAfter modeling and predicting the deterministic part of the polar motion series, the remaining residuals are fitted to the prediction using an AR model, which is a prediction model based on past patterns of the time series variables themselves. The AR(p) model equation for the fitted residual term of polar motion can be summarized as follows [48]:\nZt = p\n\u2211 i=1 \u03d5iZt\u2212i + at (17)\nwhere \u03d5i is the model parameters, at is the white noise, Zt is the fitted residual terms, and p is the order of AR model."

            "text": "The International VLBI Service for Geodesy and Astrometry (IVS) organized IVSR1 and IVS-R4 sessions every Monday and Thursday, respectively, and these sessions usually involve a network of 5\u201310 VLBI stations for observation [13]. In this paper, the ERP series were obtained by estimating VLBI observations from 2011 to 2020 for IVS-R1/R4 sessions; furthermore, the CONT08, CONT11, CONT14, and CONT17 observations were estimated. The results show that the average RMSE based on the IVS-R1/R4 solution is about 0.19 mas for polar motion and 0.02 ms for UT1-UTC, while the accuracy of the CONT solutions is about 0.04 mas and 0.01 ms for polar motion and UT1-UTC, respectively. There may be two reasons for these results: One may be that the IVS-R1/R4 sessions have only 5\u201310 stations, while CONT campaigns have more globally distributed stations, and the IVS-R1/R4 sessions have a lower rate of data recording (256 Mbit/s) rather than the faster 512 Mbit/s. Another reason may be the difference in accuracy due to the epoch continuum. Obviously, polar motion is one of the key parameters of ERP, which is defined as the motion of the Celestial Intermediate Pole (CIP) relative to the Earth\u2019s surface. It is composed\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 427 12 of 17\nof a collection of motions covering a range from secular to sub-daily time scales [50]. The polar motion series consists of three significant components: long-term trend, Chandler wobble, and annual wobble. The large-scale secular deformation of Earth causes longterm drift of the polar motion [51]. The Chandler wobble refers to the motion of the CIP over the Earth\u2019s surface, which is caused by the rotation axis not being aligned with the inertia axis [50], and is an excited resonance of the Earth\u2019s rotation over a period of about 14 months [52]. The annual wobble is another important component of the polar motion and current findings confirm that it consists of two components, retrograde, and prograde wobble [53,54]. Furthermore, to explore the high-frequency variations in more detail, fast Fourier transform (FFT), for polar motion time series spectrum analysis, was selected in this paper. The spectrum of polar motion series is plotted in Figure 7, and the results show that the polar motion series exhibit extremely significant Chandler and annual wobble of about 426 days and 360 days, respectively. In addition, the results also showed a weaker retrograde oscillation with an amplitude of about 3.5 mas, and we enlarged the scale of the amplitude in order to explore more details of the retrograde wobble. Previous studies have proposed that the possible causes of excitation for Chandler wobble include variations in submarine, atmospheric, and groundwater pressure, as well as seismic excitation, and the annual wobble may be excited by variations in the atmosphere, ocean, and groundwater [55\u201357]. Remote Sens. 2023, 14, x FOR PEER REVIEW 13 of 17 cit tion, and the annual wobble may be excit d by variati in the atmosphere, ocean, and groundwater [55\u201357].\nFigure 7.

The results show an average RMSE of 0.187 and 0.205 mas for PMX and PMY, respectively, and accuracy of 0.022 ms for UT1-UTC based on IVS-R1/R4 solutions. The accuracy of polar motion for CONT solutions was in the range of 0.03\u20130.05 mas, and for UT1-UTC based on the CONT solutions it was 0.005\u20130.01 ms. Furthermore, to investigate the high-frequency variations in more detail, we performed spectral analysis of the polar motion series using fast Fourier transform (FFT). The results show that the polar motion series exhibit extremely significant Chandler and annual wobble of about 426 days and 360 days, respectively. In addition, the results also show weaker retrograde oscillation with an amplitude of about 3.5 mas. Another important finding is that the hybrid CNN\u2013LSTM model proposed in this paper is applicable to polar motion prediction. In short term prediction (0\u201360 days), the LS + AR model was superior, whereas in medium- to long-term prediction (90\u2013360 days), the hybrid CNN\u2013LSTM model improved PMX and PMY 54% and 31%, respectively. These results further support the observation that the hybrid CNN\u2013LSTM model is slightly less accurate in short-term prediction and more accurate in medium- and long-term prediction. One possible explanation for these results is that the model may not have been trained optimally at the beginning. In addition, possible interference of the base time series cannot be ruled out. We tested the variability of the effect of different base series on the prediction of polar motion, and the results indicate that the accuracy of the prediction model gradually improved over time. One limitation of the methods in this paper is that the training model for the 6-year base series was not very effective, and this needs to be further explored in our next work. We also need to consider the effect of numerous excitation sources on the prediction accuracy. Our future work will be devoted to investigating the effect of different excitation sources and base time series on prediction accuracy.\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 427 15 of 17\nAuthor Contributions: L.L. advocated the experimental ideas and methods; L.L. and K.Y.
