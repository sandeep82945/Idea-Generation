 Here are 5 potential future research directions based on the paper:

1. Further tighten the bounds on the existence of stable solutions, especially for larger numbers of public goods (g ≥ 7). The paper leaves an asymptotic gap between the lower and upper bounds. Closing this gap could lead to more practical guarantees.

2. Investigate special cases where strategyproof stable mechanisms may be possible for 3 ≤ g ≤ 6 public goods, despite the general impossibility result. The impossibility proof relies on a worst-case construction, so there may be meaningful special cases where strategyproofness can be achieved. 

3. Explore computational complexity and algorithms for finding stable solutions. The paper gives polynomial time algorithms, but leaves open whether a linear time algorithm exists for the tightest proven upper bound.

4. Consider alternative models and stability concepts, such as allowing for capacities on public goods, incomplete preferences, or alternate feasibility requirements. The paper studies a specific model, but there are many natural extensions.

5. Look for real-world applications and test how well the stable matching solutions work in practice. The paper discusses some motivating applications, but further validation on real data could be useful.
