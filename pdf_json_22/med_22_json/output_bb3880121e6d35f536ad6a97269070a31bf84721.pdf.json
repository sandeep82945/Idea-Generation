To reveal the mechanisms underlying the crossover between these motility regimes, we have developed a multiscale chemo-mechanical whole-cell theory for mesenchymal migration. Our framework couples the sub-cellular focal adhesion dynamics at the cell-substrate in10",

Physical Sciences, Biophysics and Computational Biology. Keywords. Mechanobiology, mesenchymal migration, durotaxis.\nIncreasing experimental evidence validates that both the elastic stiffness and viscosity of the extracellular matrix regulate mesenchymal cell behavior, such as the rational5 switch between durotaxis (cell migration to stiffer regions), anti-durotaxis (migration to softer regions), and adurotaxis (stiffness-insensitive migration). To reveal the mechanisms underlying the crossover between these motility regimes, we have developed a multiscale chemo-mechanical whole-cell theory for mesenchymal migration. Our framework couples the sub-cellular focal adhesion dynamics at the cell-substrate in-10 terface with the cellular cytoskeletal mechanics and the chemical signaling pathways involving Rho GTPase proteins. Upon polarization by the Rho GTPase gradients, our simulated cell migrates by concerted peripheral protrusions and contractions, a hallmark of the mesenchymal mode. The resulting cell dynamics quantitatively reproduces the experimental migration speed as a function of the uniform substrate stiffness15 and explains the influence of viscosity on the migration efficiency. In the presence of stiffness gradients and absence of chemical polarization, our simulated cell can exhibit durotaxis, anti-durotaxis, and adurotaxis respectively with increasing substrate stiffness or viscosity. The cell moves toward an optimally stiff region from softer regions during durotaxis and from stiffer regions during anti-durotaxis. We show that20 cell polarization through steep Rho GTPase gradients can reverse the migration direction dictated by the mechanical cues. Overall, our theory demonstrates that opposing durotactic behaviors emerge via the interplay between intracellular signaling and cellmedium mechanical interactions in agreement with experiments, thereby elucidating complex mechano-sensing at the single-cell level.25"

            "text": "Mesenchymal migration is fundamental to physiological and pathological phenomena such as development, growth, and tumor invasion. A mesenchymal cell moves by means of the recurring formation and removal of peripheral focal adhesion (FA) sites where it senses the mechanical properties of the extracellular matrix (ECM) [1\u20135]. At each FA site, the cell spreads at a speed set by the competition between30 actin polymerization, actomyosin contractility due to the pulling of the myosin motors, and mechanical stresses accross the cell-ECM interface. The net migration speed is determined at the whole-cell level by the contributions from all FA sites, highlighting the multiscale nature of the process, and has a nonmonotonic dependence on the ECM elastic stiffness [6\u20139]. This trend was qualitatively explained by a stochastic theory of the \u201cmotor-clutch\u201d force transmission on a single FA site at the cell anterior [10, 11].35 Because biological tissues are viscoelastic, the motor-clutch model was recently extended to investigate the cellular response to viscoelasticity [12\u201314]. Despite the successes of the single FA theories, the physico-chemical dynamics of motility requires a multi-scale whole-cell description. This is because, first, single FA models inherently overestimate the measured migration speeds since the opposing traction forces across the distant FA sites of a cell are40 ignored. Second, cells must detect the substrate heterogeneity with a higher resolution across their body than at the single FA scale. For example, vascular smooth muscle cells, glioblastoma cells (U-87MG and U-251MG), and MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells can move up the stiffness gradients, termed durotaxis [15\u201318]. MDA-MB-231 and U-251MG can also migrate against stiffness gradients, known as anti-durotaxis, or become adurotactic by being insensitive to the gradients [17\u201319]. Some theories45 replicated durotaxis by taking the traction force or migration speed as explicit functions of substrate stiffness [20, 21]. However, since durotaxis is a posteriori built into these models, they cannot address the switch between durotaxis and anti-durotaxis. Third, migration is regulated by the cell-level reactiontransport dynamics of an intracellular biopolymer network. This involves the two prominent GTPase proteins, such as Rac1, which controls actin polymerization and focal complex assembly, and RhoA,50 which modulates actomyosin contractility [22\u201324]. A multi-scale approach that considers the biochemical signaling dynamics together with the responses of distinct FA sites to the local substrate mechanics could potentially explain the experimental migration speeds and the gradient sensitivity. Here, we present a multiscale chemo-mechanical whole-cell theory for mesenchymal migration on viscoelastic substrates. Our model couples the sub-cellular mechanics of the substrate\u2013FA site inter-55 faces with the cell-scale mechanics of the nucleus\u2013cytoskeletal network complex and reaction-diffusion dynamics of the Rac1 and RhoA GTPase proteins. Hence, our framework differentiates itself from the existing whole-cell theories that are purely mechanical or do not explicitly incorporate the sub-cellular FA dynamics [25\u201330]. Our simulated cell can acquire a chemically induced polarization and a dynamic complex morphology during migration, with a speed profile that is biphasic with respect to the sub-60 strate elasticity about a threshold stiffness, in quantitative agreement with experiments. Moreover, for a Kelvin-Voigt viscoelastic substrate, we analytically determine the traction force at an FA site in terms of the substrate viscosity and stiffness, and explain how the migration speed changes biphasically about a threshold viscosity, beyond which the cell abruptly loses traction. Importantly, the explicit treatment of the cell FA sites allows us to investigate the migration on nonuniform substrates with stiffness gradients.65 For a chemically apolar cell, we identify the crossover between durotaxis, anti-durotaxis, and adurotaxis as a function of the substrate stiffness and viscosity, and propose a unifying mechanism for the mechanosensitivity of mesenchymal migration. We further show that switching on the chemical polarity can\noverride the cell mechanical response and reverse the migration direction. Altogether, our results explain how the observed cell motility patterns are governed by the interplay between cell signaling, substrate70 elasticity and viscosity, which are difficult to independently control in experiments.\nMultiscale chemo-mechanical theory for mesenchymal migration\nThe biological components included in our multiscale whole-cell theory are illustrated in Fig. 1 A, B. Mesenchymal migration is initiated by an emergent intracellular polarization that drives the formation of leading edges with actin-rich protrusion sites and the actomyosin-induced retraction at the cell rear.75 Upon polarization, FA sites form at the protruding edges. Each vertex in our model is assigned a FA site (Fig. 1 C, D). The polarization is induced (i) by the gradients in the substrate material properties, which require modeling the mechanical cell-substrate interactions, and/or (ii) by the distribution of Rho GTPase proteins in inactive or active states across the cell, which necessitate a continuum description in the form of cell-level reaction-diffusion equations [22, 27, 29]. At the sub-cellular level, coupling (i) and (ii)80 with a motor-clutch model for the FA sites at each vertex allows us to determine how the Rho GTPases regulate actin polymerization, tensile actomyosin forces, and adhesion dynamics (Fig. 1 B, C). At the cell level, the forces generated at the FA sites, the membrane resistance forces, the cytoskeletal elastic forces, and the cytoplasmic viscous forces are all transferred to the nucleus, which serves as the hub for global force transmission across the cell in our model (Fig. 1 D, E). For the Rho GTPase dynamics, we85 adopt the reaction-diffusion framework introduced in Ref. [29]. To model each FA site, we generalize the motor-clutch model for a viscoelastic substrate in Ref. [14] to include the effect of the Rho GTPases and the substrate heterogeneity. We neglect the inertial forces since cells migrate in low-Reynolds-number environments. In our formulation, all variables are time dependent, the time derivative of a variable f = f(t) is denoted by f\u0307 , and f i represents the value of f at the vertex i across the model cell.90\nEquations of motion at sub-cellular level. Mesenchymal cell migration is maintained by the peripheral FA sites where molecular clutches are formed temporarily between the integrin ligands bound to the viscoelastic ECM and the intracellular actomyosin complex (Fig. 1 B, C). At the sub-cellular level of our model, each vertex i comprises an FA site that transmits forces between the ECM and actomyosin, and an elastic membrane section (Fig. 1 C, D). A cytoskeletal \u201cspring\u201d linked to a vertex represents the95 microtubules and intermediate filaments, which transmit forces between the nucleus, the FA site, and the membrane (Fig. 1 D, E). Denoting xi(t) as the position vector of the vertex i , we characterize the edge protrusions and retractions with a local spreading velocity Vis \u2261 x\u0307i , which is regulated by the Rho GTPase proteins. At vertex i , we consider the two prominent Rho GTPase members Rac1 (Ri) and RhoA (\u03c1i); each can be in 2 membrane-bound states with active concentrations Ria , \u03c1 i a and inactive100\nconcentrations Riin , \u03c1 i in . For simplicity, our model assumes that active chemo-mechanical processes determine solely the radial spreading speed along the cytoskeletal springs V is,n \u2261 Vis \u00b7ni whereas the polar spreading speed V is,\u03c4 \u2261 Vis \u00b7\u03c4 i is set by the passive membrane deformations (ni , \u03c4 i defined in Fig. 1 D).\nThe radial spreading speed V is,n is dictated by the competition between actin polimerization, myosin motor forces, and the membrane resistance. Actin filaments polymerize against the cell membrane with105 a polymerization speed V ip at each vertex i (Fig.1 B, C). In our model, V i p is determined by the active\nRac1 concentration Ria and its mean \u27e8Ria\u27e9 averaged over all vertices as V ip = Ria \u27e8Ria\u27e9 V 0p , where V 0 p is the reference polymerization speed. The inward pulling forces of the myosin motors and the membrane\nelastic resistance counteract actin polymerization by inducing an actin retrograde flow with a speed V ir from the edge to the interior of the cell. Then, V is,n is given by110\nV is,n = V i p \u2212 V ir . (1)\nThe retrograde flow speed V ir is governed by the force balance at the FA sites and will be detailed below. Eq. 1 links the spreading dynamics to the local active Rac1 GTPase concentration and its cell-level average, building in a coupling across the two scales. The actin retrograde flow is actively controlled by the myosin motors within the peripheral acto-115 myosin complex. At the FA site where the cell forms molecular clutches between actomyosin and the ECM, the retrograde flow speed is defined as V ir \u2261 x\u0307ir where xir is displacement of the actomyosin end of the FA site at vertex i (Fig. 1 C). Defining F ic as the elastic restoring force of the bounded clutches and F ip as the net force resisting protrusion, the net local pulling force acting on the actomyosin complex\nF iam = F i c \u2212 F ip (2)120\nregulates V ir experimentally according to the empirical force-velocity relation [10]\nV ir \u2261 x\u0307ir = V0 ( 1\u2212 F i am\nN imfm\n) , (3)\nwhere V0 is the unloaded myosin motor speed at F iam = 0 , N i m is the number of active myosin motors, and fm is the force that stalls the activity of one myosin motor. Because active RhoA proteins enhance myosin-induced cell contraction [31, 32], we relate N im to the active RhoA concentration \u03c1 i a as N i m =125\n\u03c1ia \u27e8\u03c1ia\u27e9 N0m , where \u27e8\u03c1ia\u27e9 is the mean active RhoA concentration averaged over all vertices and N0m is the reference myosin motor number. In Eq. 2, F ic is set by the cell-medium interactions at equilibrium at the FA site, and F ip is computed from a force balance across the vertex i and the attached cytoskeletal elements (Fig. 1 D, E). We determine these two forces next. At each FA site, the bound clutches between the extracellular integrin ligands and the intracellular130 actomyosin complex must generate a restoring force between the displacement at the filament end xir and that at the substrate end xisub (Fig. 1 C). Defining Kc as the clutch spring constant, the restoring force on a single clutch is f ic = Kc ( xir \u2212 xisub ) . Denoting the number of clutches as N ic(t) , and 0 \u2264 P i(t) \u2264 1\nas the fraction of the bound clutches, the total restoring clutch force at vertex i is given by\nF ic = P iN icf i c = P iN icKc ( xir \u2212 xisub ) . (4)135\nSince Rac1 proteins are required for the focal complex assembly [33\u201335], we assume that N ic is dynamically controlled by the local Rac1 concentration, i.e., N ic = Ria \u27e8Ria\u27e9 N0c , where N 0 c denotes the reference clutch number. With an association rate kion and the dissociation rate k i off , the time evolution of P\ni in Eq. 4 is governed by the mean-field rate equation [13, 14, 36]\nP\u0307 i = kion ( 1\u2212 P i ) \u2212 kioffP i . (5)140\nIn Eq. 5, we assume that the bound clutches dissociate with a catch-bond behavior with the rate kioff =\nkr0 exp ( f ic/fr0 ) + kc0 exp ( \u2212f ic/fc0 ) . Here, kr0 and kc0 denote the unloaded off-rate and the unloaded catch-rate, respectively, fr0 is the characteristic rupture force, and fc0 the characteristic catch force. At mechanical equilibrium across the FA site, the elastic force given by Eq. 4 must be balanced by the viscoelastic deformation force of the substrate with a strength F isub . Defining the local elastic stiffness145 as Kisub and uniform substrate viscosity as \u03b3sub , we use the Kelvin-Voigt model F i sub = \u03b3subx\u0307 i sub +\nKisubx i sub . (Fig. 1 C) [12]. Then, using Eq. 4 and the equality F i c = F i sub yield the equation of motion for the displacement xisub(t) at the subtrate end of the focal adhesion as\n\u03b3subx\u0307 i sub +K i subx i sub = P iN icKc ( xir \u2212 xisub ) . (6)\nThe dependence of Kisub on the vertex label i will allow us to examine the effect of the substrate stiffness150 gradients on the migration dynamics. The net peripheral force resisting protrusion F ip in Eq. 2 is determined by the balance between the radial forces on the cytoskeletal elements and those at the cell boundary (Fig.1 C, D). The cytoskeletal elements consisting of microtubules and intermediate filaments link the vertices to the cell nucleus and are represented by a Hookean spring with a stiffness constant Kcs in our model (Fig.1E). Denoting155 the position vector of the cell nucleus by xnuc(t) , the distance between the cell nucleus and the ith\nvertex of the cell is is given by the radius r0 in the undeformed (initial circular) configuration and by ri \u2261 |(xnuc \u2212 xi)| in the deformed configuration. The radial restoring force is then expressed as\nF ics = Kcs ( r0 \u2212 ri ) . (7)\nRepresenting the cell membrane by a Hookean spring with stiffness Km between two adjacent vertices,160 the tensile membrane forces at the ith vertex are given by Fim,\u00b1 = Km ( li\u00b1 \u2212 l0 ) , where li+ \u2261 xi+1\u2212xi\nand li\u2212 \u2261 xi \u2212 xi\u22121 denote the distance vectors between the vertex i and its two neighbors, and l0 is the equilibrium initial distance vector between two adjacent vertices. Defining the deformed membrane length about the ith vertex as \u27e8li\u27e9 \u2261 (|li+|+ |li\u2212|)/2 , F ip is obtained from the radial force balance\nF ip + F i cs + ( Fim,+ + F i m,\u2212 ) \u00b7 ni \u2212 \u03b7m\u27e8li\u27e9V is,n = 0 , (8)165\nwhere the last term on the left-hand side denotes the viscous drag with the viscosity \u03b7m due to interactions between the cell membrane and the surrounding medium.\nThe vertex position can be computed when, in addition to the radial spreading speed, the polar spreading speed V is,\u03c4 \u2261 Vis \u00b7 \u03c4 i in response to the passive membrane deformations is obtained by(\nFim,+ + F i m,\u2212 ) \u00b7 \u03c4 i \u2212 \u03b7m\u27e8li\u27e9V is,\u03c4 = 0 . (9)170\nEqs. 1\u2013 9 fully determine the vertex spreading velocity Vis , provided that the nucleus position xnuc and the membrane-bound Rho GTPase concentrations Ria , \u03c1 i a , R i in , \u03c1 i in at all vertices are known. We will specify xnuc(t) from cell-level force balance and Ria , \u03c1 i a , R i in , \u03c1 i in from a set of reaction-diffusion equations coupled with the dynamics of Rho GTPase proteins dissolved in the cytoplasm.\nEquations of motion at cellular level. As the largest and stiffest organelle, the nucleus transmits forces175 between different sets of cytoskeletal microtubule and intermediate filament bundles, where each set is linked to a separate FA site and a membrane section (Fig. 1 D) [37]. The resulting cell-level network\nmaintains the structural integrity of the cell by imposing a global force balance, which governs the nucleus translocation mostly independent of the centrosome position [38]. That is, the sum of the subcellular forces at each cytokeletal spring attached to the vertex i , i.e., the active force on the actomyosin180 stress fiber F iam (Eq. 2) and the passive cytoskeletal spring force F i cs (Eq. 7), determines the net nuclear\nforce Fnuc(t) according to the equilibrium condition (Fig. 1 D) (N : total number of vertices),\nN\u2211 i=1 ( F iam + F i cs ) ni + Fnuc = 0 . (10)\nThe nucleus position xnuc is governed by Fnuc noting that the nucleus undergoes passive drag with a velocity x\u0307nuc in the viscous cytoplasm. Approximating the nucleus to a rigid sphere with radius rnuc and185 denoting the cytoplasm viscosity by \u03b7cp , the viscous drag force is expressed by the Stokes\u2019 law as [26]\nFnuc = \u22126\u03c0\u03b7cprnucx\u0307nuc . (11)\nEqs. 10 and 11 complement Eqs. 1\u2013 9 to determine the motion of the nucleus and all vertices simultaneously, thereby closing the mechanical feedback loop between the sub-cellular- and cell-level dynamics.\nThe distributions of the membrane-bound active Rac1 and RhoA GTPase concentrations Gia(t) \u2261190 {Ria(t) , \u03c1ia(t)} at the cell level are set by three main mechanisms: First, they can diffuse between adjacent vertices; second, they can transition to/from the membrane-bound inactive concentrations Giin(t) \u2261 {Riin(t) , \u03c1iin(t)} , third, there can be a turnover between Giin and the cytoplasmic concentrations Gcp(t) \u2261 {Rcp(t) , \u03c1cp(t)} . To combine these three mechanisms, we adopt the biochemical reaction-diffusion model introduced in Ref. [29]. We further assume that Gcp remain spatially uniform in the cytoplasm195 at all times, and the total Rac1 and RhoA concentrations are constant over the course of migration. As depicted in Fig. 1 D, inactive-to-active conversion rates are AiG , and active-to-inactive conversion rates are IiG where G \u2261 {R, \u03c1} . The exchange between the membrane-bound inactive protein concentrations and the cytoplasmic concentrations takes place with an association rate M+G and disassociation rate M \u2212 G . The diffusive fluxes of active and inactive proteins between adjacent vertices are discretized into finite200 difference terms. The reaction-diffusion equations are then given by (y \u2261 {a , in}),\nJ iy \u2261 \u2212D\n( Gi+1y /\u27e8li+1\u27e9 \u2212Giy/\u27e8li\u27e9\n|li+|\n) ,\nG\u0307ia = A i GG i in \u2212 IiGGia + ( J i\u22121a \u2212 J ia ) ,\nG\u0307iin = \u2212AiGGiin + IiGGia + ( J i\u22121in \u2212 J i in ) + M+GGcp N \u2212M\u2212GG i in ,\nG\u0307cp = \u2212M+GGcp + N\u2211 i=1 M\u2212GG i in .\n(12)\nThe local active Rac1 and RhoA GTPase concentrations Ria , \u03c1 i a and their averages over all vertices \u27e8Ria\u27e9 , \u27e8\u03c1ia\u27e9 control the cell deformations by regulating the actin polymerization speed V ip (Eq. 1), the number of active myosin motors N im (Eq. 3), and the clutch number N i c at an FA site (Eq. 4). To incorporate205\nreverse coupling from the membrane deformations to the rate terms, the self-reinforcements of Ria, \u03c1 i a and the competition in-between, we assume the functional forms AiR = A i R(R i a, \u03c1 i a, \u03b8 i) in Eq.

Accordingly, at the vertex i = A, a high local RAa enhances the actin polymerization speed (V Ap \u221d RAa ) and also the number of molecular clutches NAc , in turn producing a strong focal adhesion245 evidenced by a high substrate traction force FAsub as per Eq. 6 (Fig.2 A, B). Strong adhesion effectively suppresses the actin retrograde flow speed V Ar and generates a \u2018sticking\u2019 state of the actin filaments. This speeds up actin polymerization (i.e., high V Ap ; see Eq. 1) to protrude the cell membrane at the vertex A (Fig. 2 A, t/T = 0.12). In contrast, low RBa at the vertex B gives rise to low V B p and low N B c .\nCorrespondingly, the focal adhesion at the vertex B allows for a high V Br , sustaining a much lower F B sub250\n(Fig. 2 B). Such a \u2018slipping state\u2019 of the actin filaments coupled with weak actin polymerization retracts the vertex B (Fig.2 A, t = 0.12). The coexistence of the sticking state with a slow retrograde flow at A and the slipping state with a fast retrograde flow at B breaks the cell symmetry [39]. Taken together, a polarized distribution of the Rac1 proteins gives rise to cell polarization and subsequent locomotion. Towards the end of a Rho GTPase relaxation cycle, the membrane-bound active concentrations Ria255 and \u03c1ia approach a uniform steady state over all vertices, terminating the peripheral gradients in F i sub\nand thus the cell polarity (Fig. 2 A, B, t/T = 0.24 \u2212 0.78 ; Fig. S3). The polarity ceases with the aid of increasing vertex angle magnitudes |\u03b8i| at e.g. the vertices A and C as follows: A strong protrusion at vertex A rapidly raises the activation rate AA\u03c1 (Eq. S2) and in turn \u03c1 A a (Fig. 2 C), which suppresses\nprotrusion by increasing the myosin motor number NAm and thus the retrograde flow speed V A r (Fig. 2 A,260\nt/T = 0.24). Similarly, a strong contraction at vertex C increases the activation rate ACR (Eq. S1) and surges RCa (Fig.2 D), which reverses the contraction (Fig.2 A, t/T = 0.24 \u2212 0.78). Consequently, the two-way chemo-mechanical coupling in our model not only captures successive cell polarization and apolarization events but also replicates the complex cell morphology (Movies S1, S2).\nWhole-cell migration speed is governed by both substrate stiffness and viscosity. At the cell front,265 the radial spreading speed of a site V is,n must be controlled by the substrate force Fsub upon molecular clutch formation with a time scale \u03c4on \u2261 1/kon . This is because Fsub sets the actin retrograde flow speed V ir (Eq. 3), in turn determining V i s,n (Eq. 1) as a function of the stiffness Ksub and viscosity \u03b3sub of a\nuniform substrate, whereas the actin polymerization speed V ip must remain largely unchanged. Then, an increase in Fsub increases V is,n , i.e., enhances traction on the substrate. For single FA dynamics, the role270 of the protrusion resistance force Fp in Eq. 2, 3 can be ignored since it builds up at a much slower rate than Fsub after clutch formation. Defining an elastic deformation time scale \u03c4l \u2261 N0mfm/KsubV0 and a retardation time scale \u03c4r \u2261 \u03b3sub/Ksub , the force generated by the myosin motors on the fully bound clutches (P i \u223c 1) sets the force on a uniform compliant substrate (Ksub \u226a N0cKc) as\nFsub(t) = N 0 mfm [ 1\u2212A(\u03b3sub) exp ( \u2212 t (\u03c4l + \u03c4r) )] , A(\u03b3sub) \u2261 \u03c4l (\u03c4l + \u03c4r) . (13)275\nEq. 13 is a single-motor-clutch relation derived from Eqs. 2\u2212 4, 6 for F ip = 0 and holds until the time of force-dependent clutch dissociation \u03c4off , i.e., at 0 \u2264 t \u2264 \u03c4off (Eq. 5, Sec. S4). Evidently, the time scales \u03c4on , \u03c4off , \u03c4l , \u03c4r predominantly govern the focal adhesion dynamics and thus the migration speed.\nWe utilize our whole-cell model to explore the dependence of the average cell migration speed on the elastic stiffness Ksub and viscosity \u03b3sub of a uniform substrate. We interpret the simulation results280 with the help of Eq. 13. In our simulations, the nonuniform random initial conditions of the active Rac1\nand RhoA concentrations Ria , \u03c1 i a are the same as in the previous section (Sec. S3). Over one simulation\nwith M \u226b 1 time steps, we define the average migration speed V as the nucleus trajectory length L \u2261 |xnuc(M\u2206t) \u2212 xnuc(0)| divided by the total time ttotal \u2261 M\u2206t , i.e., V \u2261 L/ttotal. We run n simulations to compute the distribution of V ; we define the sample mean migration speed as V .285 For a uniform elastic substrate (\u03b3sub = 0), the speed-stiffness relation has been reported to show a biphasic profile [6, 7, 25, 40]. Our whole-cell simulations quantitatively reproduce the experimental dependence of V on Ksub (n = 5 ; Fig. 3 A) [7], which we explain by the competition between the two time scales \u03c4l and \u03c4on in Eq. 13 in the elastic limit (\u03c4r = 0). Importantly, the elastic deformation time scale \u03c4l can be interpreted as the characteristic clutch lifetime until the clutches break at t \u2248 \u03c4off290 at a critical Fsub , i.e., \u03c4l \u2248 \u03c4off (Fig. S5 B, C). Because an FA site must generate optimal substrate force while the clutches are bound (\u03c4on \u2272 \u03c4l), the equality \u03c4on = \u03c4l defines a threshold stiffness K0 \u2261 N0mfmkon/V0 , which allows us to classify a substrate as \u201cstiff\u201d when Ksub > K0 and \u201csoft\u201d when Ksub < K0 (Sec. S4). Based on the parameters in Table S2, K0 \u2248 8 pN/nm . On the stiff substrate (Ksub > K0 , equivalently \u03c4on > \u03c4l), because the bound clutch fraction is low (P i \u226a 1), the substrate295 traction force and thus the migration speed remain low (Fig. 3 A). On the soft substrate (Ksub < K0 , equivalently \u03c4on < \u03c4l), higher bound clutch fraction (P i \u2248 1) induces a higher traction force, and thus a higher migration speed (Fig. 3 A and B). On the very soft substrate (Ksub \u226a K0), Eq. 13 indicates that the traction force builds up very slowly at a time \u03c4l \u226b \u03c4on, suppressing the migration speed (Fig. 3 A, B). Next, we computed the average migration speed V as a function of Ksub and \u03b3sub to resolve their300 combined effect on migration efficiency (Fig. 3 C\u2013E). For lower viscosities (\u03b3sub = 0.1 , 0.5 pN \u00b7s/nm), the average speed preserves its biphasic profile about Ksub \u2248 K0 (Fig. 3 C, D). At higher viscosities (\u03b3sub = 0.9 pN \u00b7 s/nm), however, V decreases monotonically with increasing stiffness (Fig. 3 C, D). Furthermore, V as a function of \u03b3sub is biphasic for a fixed stiffness Ksub < K0 (Fig. 3 D). The negligible change of the threshold stiffness K0 at lower viscosities and the non-monotonic dependence of V on \u03b3sub305 for Ksub < K0 can together be understood as follows: With increasing viscosity, whereas the viscoelastic deformation time scale \u03c4l + \u03c4r increases linearly, the force-dependent clutch lifetime \u03c4off changes only marginally from the purely elastic case (Fig. 3 F, S5 D). Therefore, the threshold stiffness K0 set by \u03c4on = \u03c4l remains nearly constant for sufficiently low viscosities (Fig. 3 C). Noting that the clutches in the fully bound state (P i \u2248 1) dissociate at a critical dimensionless force per clutch f\u0303c \u2261 Fsub/N0mfmN0c310 (\u2248 7\u00d710\u22123 for the parameters in Table S2; see Fig. 3 F), the viscosity can enhance the substrate traction only up until a threshold viscosity \u03b30 where, upon formation, each clutch can sustain a force f\u0303c at most. Above \u03b30 , because the substrate force per bond rapidly grows beyond f\u0303c at a time shorter than \u03c4on , the bond formation must be suppressed (\u03c4off < \u03c4on), in turn leading to a significant traction loss (Fig. S5 D). Our numerical computation of the threshold viscosity \u03b30(Ksub) based on this rationale agrees with the315 region of maximum migration speed in the contour plot (Fig. 3 C, full curve). Along the stiffness axis, \u03b30(Ksub) is terminated at Ksub = K0 , beyond which \u03c4off < \u03c4on independent of the viscosity of stiff substrates (Fig. 3 C, dashed line). This vertex-level scaling analysis explains the simulated whole-cell behavior in Fig. 3 C since the nonuniform initial Ria distribution breaks the cell symmetry and thus keeps F isub higher at the cell front than at the rear. Importantly, this difference in F i sub across the cell suppresses320\nV to be much lower than the vertex-level speed scale V0 , enabling our whole-cell model to quantitatively capture the experimentally observed migration dynamics (see Fig. 3 A).\nMigration direction depends on the local stiffness of nonuniform elastic substrates. Having elucidated how the substrate elastic stiffness and viscosity affect the migration speed, we next report cell\nsymmetry breaking and directional migration on an elastic substrate (\u03b3sub = 0) with a stiffness gradi-325 ent when chemically induced cell polarity is absent (Fig. 4 A). We specify the initial conditions for the membrane-bound Rho GTPase concentrations as follows: The active Rac1 concentration Ria is assigned a random distribution, whereas the active RhoA concentration \u03c1ia and the inactive Rac1, RhoA concentrations Riin , \u03c1 i in are set to be constant (Fig. S4). We characterize a nonuniform substrate by defining a reference stiffness Ksub,0 at x = 0 where the nucleus is initially positioned (Fig. 4 A). We introduce a330 constant stiffness gradient \u2207Ksub = 16 pN/\u00b5m2 in the +x direction; non-dimensionalization by the initial cell diameter 2r0 and the threshold stiffness K0 yields the unitless gradient \u2207\u0303K\u0303sub = 2\u00d710\u22122 \u226a 1 . For soft (Ksub,0 < K0), medium (Ksub,0 \u2248 K0), stiff (Ksub,0 > K0), and very stiff (Ksub,0 \u226b K0) substrates, we compare the effect of this small gradient on cell migration with that on a uniform substrate (Ksub = Ksub,0). For each substrate configuration, we simulate n = 100 migration events. This allows335 us to statistically differentiate between durotaxis (migration up the stiffness gradient), anti-durotaxis (migration down the stiffness gradient), or adurotaxis (random motion irrespective of the stiffness gradient) by calculating the distributions of the durotactic index DI and the angular displacement \u03c6 (Fig. 4 A). We define DI as the net horizontal displacement over Q Rho-GTPase relaxation cycles in the gradient (+x) direction divided by the total horizontal displacement [15, 41], that is (H : Heaviside step function,340 \u2206xj : displacement in the +x direction in the jth cycle),\nDI \u2261 \u2211Q\nj=1H(\u2206xi)\u2206xj\u2211Q j=1 |\u2206xj | , H(\u2206xj) =  1 , if \u2206xj > 0 , 1/2 , if \u2206xj = 0 , 0, \u2206xj < 0 .\n(14)\nEq. 14 returns DI > 0.5 for durotaxis, DI \u2248 0.5 for adurotaxis, and DI < 0.5 for anti-durotaxis. We compute the DI and \u03c6 distributions with n = 100 data points. We define the sample mean durotactic index as DI and the sample mean angular displacement as \u03c6 .345 Our results indicate that DI is inversely proportional to the reference substrate stiffness Ksub,0 in the presence of a gradient. For \u2207Ksub = 16 pN/\u00b5m2 , the simulated cells undergo durotaxis on soft substrates, with DI > 0.5 and \u03c6 \u223c 0\u25e6 (Fig. 4 B, C), in agreement with experiments [16]. Higher gradients \u2207Ksub = 32 pN/\u00b5m2 and \u2207Ksub = 160 pN/\u00b5m2 (equivalently, \u2207\u0303K\u0303sub = 4 \u00d7 10\u22122 and \u2207\u0303K\u0303sub = 0.2 in dimensionless units) on soft substrates reinforce durotaxis, as evidenced by a350 robust increase in DI and narrower angular distributions (Fig. S6). However, cells on medium and stiff substrates undergo anti-durotaxis with DI < 0.5 , supported by the corresponding angular distributions (Fig. 4 B, D, E). These results agree well with the stiffness-sensitive migration behaviors of the U-251MG glioblastoma and talin-low MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells [18]. On very stiff nonuniform substrates (Ksub,0 \u226b K0), the cells undergo adurotaxis (DI \u2248 0.5 , \u03c6 : uniform), i.e., follow random migration355 trajectories (Fig. 4 B, F). Our simulations for substrates with uniform stiffness also yield DI \u2248 0.5 ; the absence of cell symmetry-breaking again leads to adurotaxis (Fig. 4 B). The capability of our whole-cell model to produce durotaxis, anti-durotaxis, and adurotaxis as a function of the substrate stiffness and its gradients allows us to propose a unifying mechanism for stiffnesssensitive migration. On one hand, on a soft nonuniform substrate, an FA site attached to a stiffer region360 generates higher traction force where the cell in turn spreads faster than at another site attached to a softer region. In other words, FRsub > F L sub drives V R s,n > V L s,n in Fig. 4 G, navigating the cell up the\nstiffness gradient (durotaxis). On the other hand, on a stiff nonuniform substrate, the cell generates a\nhigher traction force on the softer region (FRsub < F L sub drives V R s,n < V L s,n), migrating down the stiffness gradient (anti-durotaxis). Adurotaxis occurs when the cell becomes insensitive to the gradients on very365 stiff substrates or when the traction forces are balanced at the opposing sides of the cell on a substrate with Ksub,0 \u2272 K0 (Fig. 4 G). Therefore, the biphasic dependence of the substrate force on the local stiffness is sufficient for the emergence of different durotactic phenotypes on nonuniform substrates.\nMigration direction depends on both viscosity and stiffness of viscoelastic substrates. We have reported that the substrate viscosity \u03b3sub alters the non-monotonic dependence of the migration speed370 on the substrate stiffness Ksub . Here, we study how uniform \u03b3sub alters the directional migration of a chemically apolar cell in the presence of a constant stiffness gradient \u2207Ksub = 16pN/\u00b5m2 in the +x direction. The initial conditions are the same as in the preceding section. To plot the contour map in Fig. 5 A, we performed n = 5 simulations to obtain the mean durotactic index DI for each data point {Ksub,0 , \u03b3sub} that specifies a viscoelastic substrate. Fig. 5 A exhibits three distinct migration regimes375 as a result of the mechanical interactions between the cell and the medium: Regime I pervades soft substrates (Ksub,0 < K0) with a sufficiently low viscosity where the cell undergoes durotaxis (DI > 0.5 and \u03c6 \u223c 0 ; Fig. 5 A\u2013D), in accordance with Fig. 4 C. Increasing Ksub,0 or \u03b3sub leads to Regime II in which the cell sustains anti-durotaxis (DI < 0.5 and \u03c6 \u223c 180\u25e6 ; Fig. 5 A\u2013C, E). This is because the magnitude and duration of the substrate traction forces at the FA sites are reduced on stiff and more380 viscous substrates concurrently with shorter clutch lifetimes, directing the cell towards softer regions (see Fig. 3 F and Fig. 4 G). Because cells are insensitive to a very high stiffness (Ksub,0 \u226b K0) or viscosity (\u03b3sub > \u03b30), they exhibit adurotaxis in this limit, i.e., move randomly with small displacements, which we identify as Regime III (DI \u2248 0.5 and \u03c6 : uniform; Fig. 5 A\u2013C, F). Overall, Fig. 5 A generalizes our earlier findings in Fig. 3 C for the mesencyhmal migration on uniform viscoelastic substrates.385\nRhoA induced actomyosin contractility alters cell migration direction. As opposed to our analysis of a chemically apolar cell migrating on a nonuniform viscoelastic substrate (Fig. 5), directional migration in biological environments is regulated by both mechanical and chemical cues [42, 43]. To address this complexity, we consider that external chemical fields can trigger a biased active RhoA distribution \u03c1ia at the cell membrane [24, 42]. Taking a nonuniform distribution of \u03c1 i a as an initial condition instanta-390\nneously generates a localized actomyosin contractility due to the high retrograde flow (Fig. 6 A, B). On a soft elastic substrate with Ksub,0 = 1pN/nm < K0 and \u2207Ksub = 16pN/\u00b5m2 , the simulated cells therefore exhibit anti-durotaxis (DI < 0.5 and \u03c6 \u223c 180\u25e6 for n = 50) in contrast with the durotactic migration in the absence of RhoA induced contractility (Fig. 6 C, D). Further simulations on viscoelastic substrates demonstrate that the chemical polarity can override the cell-matrix mechanical interactions,395 making cells migrate against the stiffness gradient regardless of the viscosity magnitudes (Fig. 6 E\u2013H versus Fig. 5 D\u2013F). These results suggest a selection mechanism for the migration direction in the presence of both the mechanical and chemical fields in vivo."

            "text": "Mesenchymal migration involves a dynamical interplay between physical and chemical processes across400 the sub-cellular and cellular scales in response to the biological viscoelastic media. To account for this complexity, our whole-cell model couples the dynamics of sub-cellular FA sites, which probe the local\nmechanical properties of the surrounding medium, with the local membrane mechanics and the cell-level reaction-diffusion dynamics of the two relevant Rho GTPase signals, Rac1 and RhoA. At the cellular scale of our model, the cytoskeleton transmits the forces between the FA sites and the cell nucleus where405 the global force balance sets the migration direction and speed (Fig. 1). That way, our whole-cell model exhibits all distinct stages of mesenchymal migration, i.e., the emergence of Rho GTPase induced cell polarity following FA formation, the associated complex shape changes, and the subsequent migration on uniform substrates via a stick-slip motion evidenced by the oscillating local substrate traction forces (Fig. 2). For uniform elastic substrates, we analytically determined a threshold stiffness K0 , which410 classifies the substrates as soft (Ksub < K0), medium (Ksub \u2248 K0), stiff (Ksub > K0), and very stiff (Ksub \u226b K0). The migration speed is non-monotonic with respect to the substrate stiffness about K0 , in agreement with experiments. We further found that, for viscoelastic substrates, this biphasic trend is terminated at a threshold viscosity \u03b30 where the rapid traction force build-up cannot be sustained by the bound molecular clutches anymore, suppressing their formation in the first place (Fig. 3). Next, we415 investigated the effect of the stiffness gradients on migration by switching off the Rho GTPase induced cell polarity. Our results demonstrate that the biphasic dependence of the local spreading speed on the local stiffness gives rise to durotaxis on soft substrates with low viscosity, anti-durotaxis on stiff or viscous substrates, or adurotaxis on very stiff substrates (Fig. 4, 5). Finally, we showed that imposing a RhoA-driven strong local contraction, which can be experimentally achieved by external chemical cues,420 can steer the cell along the Rho GTPase induced polarity irrespective of the stiffness gradients (Fig. 6). We close with a discussion of the limitations of our whole-cell model. Unlike the classical motorclutch model that we used here for the FA dynamics, experiments have found an adhesion reinforcement effect due to talin unfolding at the clutches [44]. An augmented clutch model that considers the adhesion reinforcement has replicated the monotonic relation between the substrate traction force and substrate425 stiffness as well as that between the cell area and stiffness [13, 26, 45]. However, this theoretical modification cannot preserve the experimentally confirmed biphasic speed versus stiffness profile, which is a natural theoretical question for further investigation. Another limitation is that we only track the activities of two primary chemical signals, Rac1 and RhoA, for simplicity. However, Rac1 and RhoA interact with other proteins such as ROCK and DIA [22].430 Moreover, we manually reinitialize the active Rac1 and RhoA concentrations when they reach a steady state. A self-perpetuating oscillatory state in signal transduction can be obtained by taking into account regulations of other proteins [22], inputs from ECM [46], and a more comprehensive reverse coupling from the cell mechanics [30]. Although this simplification does not undermine our results, integrating the dynamics of additional proteins can enhance the chemo-mechanical feedback of our whole-cell model.435 A third shortcoming is that our whole-cell model simplifies the cell structural mechanics. We represent the cytoskeleton by linear Hookean springs. However, since the cell stiffness depends on the cell area [45], large deformations may induce a nonlinear strain-stiffening effect of the cytoskeleton network. It is also known that cytoskeletal filaments are inherently dynamic due to their polymerization and crosslinking kinetics [47]. Furthermore, whereas our model assumes static links between the nucleus440 and cytoskeleton, the nucleus motion is affected by constant cytoskeletal\u2013nuclear binding and unbinding events [48]. Incorporating the cytoskeletal kinetics and cytoskeletal-nuclear interactions into our whole-cell model may allow us to assess their relevance to the cell migration dynamics. These limitations notwithstanding, our whole-cell model unifies seemingly opposing durotactic behaviors due to the mechanical cell-medium interactions and the intracellular signaling pathways. It445 therefore elucidates complex mechano-sensing at the single-cell level and paves the way for the general-\nization of cell behavior and migration in three dimensional microenvironments.\nAuthor contributions.
