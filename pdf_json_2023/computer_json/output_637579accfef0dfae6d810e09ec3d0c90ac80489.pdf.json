    "abstractText": "To overcome spatial, spectral and temporal constraints of different remote sensing products, data fusion is a good technique to improve the prediction capability of soil prediction models. However, few studies have analyzed the effects of image fusion on digital soil mapping (DSM) models. This research fused multispectral (MS) and panchromatic Landsat 8 (L8) bands, and MS Sentinel 2 (S2) and panchromatic L8 bands using the Brovey, Intensity\u2013Hue\u2013Saturation and Gram\u2013 Schmidt methods in an agricultural area in Yellow River Basin, China. To analyze the effects of image fusion on DSM models, various SOC prediction models derived from remote sensing image datasets were established by the random forest method. Soil salinity indices and spectral reflectance from all the remote sensing data had relatively strong negative correlations with SOC, and vegetation indices and water indices from all the remote sensing data had relatively strong positive correlations with SOC. Soil moisture and vegetation were the main controlling factors of the SOC spatial pattern in the study area. More spectral indices derived from pansharpened L8 and fused S2\u2013L8 images by all three image fusion methods had stronger relationships with SOC compared with those from MS L8 and MS S2, respectively. All the SOC models established by pansharpened L8 and fused S2\u2013L8 images had higher prediction accuracy than those established by MS L8 and MS S2, respectively. The fusion between S2 and L8 bands had stronger effects on enhancing the prediction accuracy of SOC models compared with the fusion between panchromatic and MS L8 bands. It is concluded that digital soil mapping and image fusion can be utilized to increase the prediction performance of SOC spatial prediction models.",

            "text": "Soil is a crucial component of the ecological environment and closely related to food security and ecological functions including water retention, carbon sequestration, and climate change mitigation [1]. Assessing the spatial characteristics of soil nutrient contents in farmland can provide important information about soil fertility, sustainable soil management, food security and ecosystem health [2]. Digital soil mapping (DSM) techniques are important tools to show the spatial pattern of soil nutrients in wetland [3], forest [4], grassland [5] and farmland [6,7] areas. DSM can overcome the disadvantages of traditional soil mapping and has been widely utilized to quantify soil information with higher temporal\u2013spatial resolution and model accuracy, and lower uncertainty [8]. Soil properties in agricultural ecosystems are highly dynamic and affected by human-induced activities including irrigation, fertilization, applications of pesticide and desertification [9]. They tend to show large spatial heterogeneity compared with other ecosystems. Unlike DSM\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 2017. https://doi.org/10.3390/rs15082017 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/remotesensing\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 2017 2 of 16\nresearch at the continental and national scales [2,10], the soil-landscape attributes of DSM including land use, parent material, climate conditions and topographic attributes at the county and township scales do not demonstrate strong spatial variations. As a result, remote sensing-based spectral indices can explain the spatial distribution of soil nutrients at the county and township scales [11]. Different remote sensing products, however, have their own characteristics and different spatial/spectral/temporal resolutions. The spectral indices derived from various remote sensing sensors have different capabilities to predict soil properties. For instance, L8 bands range from the visible to thermal infrared part of the electromagnetic spectrum. At the same time, L8 lacks a red-edge band and has medium spatial resolution (30 m). Although the spatial resolution of some remote sensing images including WorldView-2 and GeoEye-1 is 2 m, they do not have short-wave infrared and thermal infrared bands [12]. Data fusion of various remote sensing products with different spatial, temporal and spectral resolution is increasingly becoming a strong trend in remote sensing applications, which can provide important environmental factors capable of explaining the variations in soil properties at the local scale. Among the advantages of data fusion is its outcome or response, which is more than the sum of the involved components [13,14]. Improved models and scientific understanding can be achieved through incorporating various datasets and methods that are coming from diverse disciplines [15,16]. Various studies already proved the importance of geospatial data fusion in different research fields. The authors of [17] fused Landsat 7 images (medium spatial and coarse temporal resolution) and MODIS images (coarse spatial and fine temporal resolution) to derive phenological information of an agricultural system in Germany. Data fusion of aerial photography and LiDAR can achieve automated volcano mapping with high accuracy [18]. The incorporation of multitemporal Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and optical data can achieve higher prediction accuracy of crop types compared with standalone SAR or optical data [19]. The application of data fusion in DSM is still in its infancy, and the effect of data fusion on DSM is an active research topic. The incorporation of complementary satellite data including MODIS and S2 improved the clay content estimation of the topsoil layers in mainland France [20]. The integration of airborne hyperspectral and proximal sensing reduced the uncertainty of soil clay content prediction models [21]. Most research focused on the integration of laboratory spectral or proximal sensing in DSM, and the effect of image fusion on DSM is not clarified. The authors of [22] utilized the Brovey, Gram\u2013Schmit (GS), and Intensity\u2013Hue\u2013Saturation (IHS) methods to fuse the multispectral bands and panchromatic band of L8, and concluded that DSM models of soil total nitrogen based on pansharpened (PAN) L8 had slightly higher prediction accuracy than MS L8-based models. Most of the studies utilizing image fusion just compared the DSM models based on MS and PAN images of the same imaging platform. Few studies have explored the effects of data fusion between different types of remote sensing images on DSM models. Food security has long been a priority of developing countries due to the major challenges posed by the large population and limited agricultural land [23]. DSM techniques can explore site-specific soil fertility status of the farmland and help farmers identify soil quality problems over a large-scale agricultural area. Fusion and incorporation of different datasets, technologies and approaches can complement each other and improve spatial modeling of soil properties [24]. The aims of this research are to (1) analyze the relationships between soil organic carbon (SOC) and environmental factors including remote sensing predictors; (2) establish DSM models based on MS and fused remote sensing images, and compare prediction performances and predicted maps of DSM models; (3) explore the effects of the remote sensing image fusion on DSM in an agricultural fields in Yellow River Basin, China.\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 2017 3 of 16"

Spectral reflectances of different bands, band ratios between different bands, red band-based vegetation indices including the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), red-edge-band-based vegetation indices including the Normalized Difference Red-edge Index (NDVIr), bare soil indices including the Normalized Difference Soil Index (NDSI), water indices including the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI), temperature indices including the at-satellite brightness temperature for thermal bands (T1, T2), and salinity indices including Salinity Index 1 (SI1) were acquired from MS L8 image, PAN L8 images, MS S2 image, and fused S2\u2013L8 images. Topographic attributes were extracted from the GTOPO30 digital elevation model (DEM) with 30 m resolution acquired from the USGS website (https://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/, accessed on 20 March 2020). Principal component analysis (PCA) is the algorithm that can identify the optimum linear combination of the original image bands and account for most of the variation in pixel values [32]. PCA of the ArcGIS tool was employed to derive PC scores (P1, P2 and P3) for bands of remote sensing imagery. In addition, geographic attributes and crop types were also chosen as environmental factors in this research. All the environmental data in Table S1 were transformed to the Universal Transverse Mercator map projection (Zone: 50 N; Datum: WGS 1984).\n2.4. Model Calibration and Validation 2.4.1. Model Calibration\nSoil samples were separated into a calibration dataset (70% of the total samples: 109 samples) and a validation dataset (30% of total samples: 46 samples). The calibration datasets were utilized to establish spatial prediction models of SOC, while the validation datasets were utilized for validation. This research established 8 models including SOC prediction models based on MS L8 (LT model) (spatial resolution: 30 m), Brovey L8 (LTb model) (15 m), IHS L8 (LTi model) (15 m), GS L8 (LTg model) (15 m), MS S2 (ST model) (20 m), Brovey fused S2\u2013L8 (STb model) (15 m), IHS fused S2\u2013L8 (STi model) (15 m), and GS fused S2\u2013L8 (STg model) (15 m). By comparing the model performance and DSM maps of those 8 models, this research aims to reveal the effects of image fusion on DSM. Environmental factors which are relevant to the SOC were identified using the Boruta algorithm [33]. The Boruta algorithm is an ensemble method in which classification is performed by voting of multiple unbiased weak classifier decision trees, and it can identify linear and nonlinear relationships between soil properties and environmental factors [33,34]. Optimal variables identified by the Boruta algorithm (Figures 2 and 3) were utilized as predictors to develop SOC prediction models based on random forest (RF) method. RF is a tree-based prediction model developed by [35]. RF method can accommodate different types of input data, and deal with non-linearity between the environmental factors and target soil properties including SOC, and the interaction between the environmental factors. Multiple trees were developed by using a modified bootstrap aggregation (bagging) algorithm. Model predictions are then estimated as weighted averages across all trees. The optimization of the number of trees (ntree), and the number of variables as a predictor at each tree (mtry) were conducted by using different combinations of ntree and mtry. The ntree was set between 100 and 900 at intervals of 200, and the mtry was set between 1 and 15 at 1 interval.

            "text": "Topographic attributes had relatively weak correlations and low importance scores with SOC, suggesting they were not among the main factors that control the SOC spatial distribution. It is noticeable that topographic attributes including elevation and slope were relatively homogeneous in this agricultural area of North China Plain. Most environmental factors selected as optimal variables were remote sensing predictors (Figures 2 and 3). This suggests the importance of remote sensing predictors in predicting soil properties in plain agricultural area. Multiple research already indicated that spectral reflectance decreases with the increase in soil water content [37,38]. The negative correlations between spectral reflectances and SOC from L8 and S2 imply that higher soil moisture (lower spectral reflectance) contribute to the accumulation of SOC. The positive correlations between the NDWI and SOC suggests the potential positive feedback between soil moisture and SOC. The positive feedback between soil moisture and SOC confirmed the contribution of soil moisture on soil organic carbon sequestration, which is noticed in other agricultural areas in Canada [39] and Brazil [40]. The positive association between vegetation indices and SOC also imply that the more vegetated farmlands are more likely to have more SOC compared with less vegetated farmlands. Although large areas of soils were covered with plants and crops in remote sensing images, vegetation indices become good predictors for SOC as SOC is closely related to aboveground biomass and net primary productivity [41,42]. S2 Red-Edge Position (STS2REP) is ranked as the most important spectral index among all the S2 spectral indices. STS2REP was tested to have very strong relationship with leaf chlorophyll concentration, and it is a surrogate measure of vegetation chlorophyll content [43]. The inclusion of red-edge-band-based spectral indices as model predictors can mitigate the saturation effect at higher canopy chlorophyll content compared with red band-based spectral indices, and better reflect the health and function of aboveground vegetation and SOC. Most S2 spectral indices identified as optimal variables were RE band-based spectral indices (Figure 3), suggesting that four RE bands of S2 images have stronger capability to explain the SOC spatial variation compared with other bands. It is possible that RE band-based spectral indices had stronger capability in predicting the vegetation compared with NIR bandbased spectral indices, as they are more sensitive to chlorophyll content and can overcome the saturation problem [44]. Vegetation is an important factors that can reflect the SOC distribution due to the significant influence of the SOC on the growth status and quality of\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 2017 12 of 16\ncrops in agricultural land [45,46]. The at-satellite brightness temperature of L8 image had the highest importance scores, indicating the strong potential of long wavelength (thermal) bands from L8 in predicting SOC. The large farmland areas at the north of the study area, which are also adjacent to Yellow River, had relatively low SOC concentration. The long-term washing and flooding caused by the Yellow River could have led to soil erosion and SOC decrease in farmland near the river. The SOC concentration in the farmlands adjacent to the two reservoirs in the study area was at high levels, which also suggest the effect of soil moisture on SOC. In general, SOC is mainly affected by soil moisture and vegetation in the study area."

            "heading": "4.2. Effect of Remote Sensing Fusion on DSM",
            "text": "Various research have already proven that it is not possible to find the best remote sensing product for DSM as different remote sensing products have their own advantages and disadvantages in terms of spatial/spectral/temporal resolutions, purchase expenses and data quality [47,48]. As a result, data fusion is a good method that can take advantage of various remote sensing products and contribute to the model performance of DSM. Most of the research did not perform the image fusion, and they just analyzed the combination of different remote sensing sensor on digital soil mapping [49,50]. This research analyzed the effects of data fusion between MS and PAN bands of a single remote sensing product (L8) and two different remote sensing products (S2 and L8) on DSM. The spectral behavior of the fused images was similar to the original MS images. For example, vegetation indices and water indices from both the MS and fused images showed positive relationships with SOC (Tables 2 and 3). More PAN L8 and fused S2\u2013L8 spectral indices were selected as optimal variables than MS L8 and MS S2 spectral indices, respectively. This suggests that the fused spectral indices can explain the variation of SOC spatial distribution more precisely compared with MS spectral indices. This result confirms the advantages of image fusion, which does not only integrates the spectral information from the source images, but also preserves the spectral information of the source images [51]. Table 4 indicates that the fusion of PAN L8 spectral indices slightly enhanced the prediction performance of MS L8-based SOC model. It is possible that spectral information of MS and PAN bands from L8 are similar, and the fusion between MS and panchromatic bands from L8 could not overcome the limitation of L8 products. In comparison, the integration of fused S2\u2013L8 spectral indices remarkably enhanced the prediction performance of the MS S2-based SOC model. The results suggest the potential advantages of fusion between different images on enhancing the predictive performance of DSM over fusion between MS and panchromatic bands from a single image. The data fusion between MS S2 bands and the L8 panchromatic band overcame the limitations from a single remote sensing sensor. Hence, both sensors\u2019 spatial and spectral information can be utilized or partially utilized by the data fusion techniques. Although the three SOC maps derived from PAN L8 (Figure 5B\u2013D) and fused S2\u2013L8 (Figure 7B\u2013D) had the same spatial resolution (15 m), Figure 7B\u2013D showed higher spatial heterogeneity and more evident patch distribution in different farmlands compared with Figure 5B\u2013D. In summary, the fusion between bands from different remote sensing products has stronger effects on enhancing SOC prediction accuracy compared with the fusion between bands from a single remote sensing product."

Vegetation cover, soil moisture, surface roughness and management practices can also affect the soil prediction model performances. Developing soil prediction models with high temporal and spatial resolution and predictive capability has high potential to promote sustainable farm management in developing countries such as India and China. Soil organic carbon\nRemote Sens. 2023, 15, 2017 13 of 16\nstocks of Western Ghats were predicted by Quantile Regression Forest algorithm by incorporating derivatives of the digital elevation model, L8 and MODIS images [53]. Multiple geostatistical and data mining methods were utilized to predict major soil nutrients in Northwestern China, and explored the effect mechanism between the spatial pattern of soil nutrients and farmland management practice [54]. As L8 and S2 are free to download, and have fair spatial, spectral and temporal resolutions, they are widely used in DSM. The results from this research also proved that the application of image fusion can not only enhance the prediction accuracy of DSM, but also increase the spatial resolution of soil maps. In the future, models of other soil properties can be developed using digital soil mapping and image fusion techniques in vast agricultural areas with different topographic and climate conditions."

In general, SOC spatial distribution is mainly affected by soil moisture and vegetation in the study area. All the SOC models based on fused remote sensing images had higher prediction performances compared with those based on MS remote sensing images. The data fusion between bands from L8 and S2 has stronger effects on enhancing SOC prediction accuracy compared with the fusion between bands from L8.
