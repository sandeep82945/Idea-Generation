Similar to previous global outbreaks (e.g., Ebola, H1N1, avian flu, and SARS), the COVID-19 pandemic has been shown to predict psychological stress, depression and anxiety in addition to substantial morbidity and mortality (Bults et al., 2011; Huang and Zhao, 2020; Jungmann and Witth\u00f6ft, 2020; Li et al., 2020; Rajkumar, 2020). Restriction of regular daily activities such as school, work, and travel have been shown to be effective in preventing exposure and containing the spread of COVID-19, but these polices, collectively known as \u201csocial distancing,\u201d are likely to contribute to the substantial perceived stress associated with the pandemic.\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 1 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 838507\nIndeed, since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic in December 2019, psychological and physiological impacts such as generalized anxiety, depression, poor health behaviors, and insomnia have been observed across the globe (Sabel et al., 2018; Alkhamees et al., 2020; Clemente-Su\u00e1rez et al., 2020; Qi et al., 2020; Rossi et al., 2020; Goularte et al., 2021; Liu et al., 2021a,b; Rossi et al., 2021). A recent review of the impacts of quarantining during COVID-19 has identified several influential stressors contributing to negative psychological outcomes during pandemics (Brooks et al., 2020; ClementeSu\u00e1rez et al., 2020). Isolation limits the social resources required for coping and predicts negative mental and cardiovascular outcomes (Bavel et al., 2020; Xiao et al., 2020). In addition, the current COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in mass layoffs, pay cuts, reduced work hours and work-from-home orders (Brooks et al., 2020; Restubog et al., 2020). Indeed, both individual financial and labor market concerns are associated with negative psychological outcomes (Restubog et al., 2020), contributing to the overall stress that many have experienced during the pandemic.\nThe present pandemic highlights the essential role of emotion regulation as a means to help mitigate stress people are experiencing during COVID-19. Emotion regulation can be implemented via one or more regulation strategies (Gross, 1998). James Gross\u2019 process model of emotion regulation is a useful theoretical framework through which to examine separable classes of emotion regulation strategies that individuals may implement to change how they feel (Gross, 1998, 2015). Strategies of emotion regulation described by the process model are situation selection (e.g., avoiding an emotional situation entirely), situation modification (e.g., altering the external environment), attention redeployment (e.g., shifting internal or external attention), cognitive change (e.g., cognitive reappraisal; changing the meaning of an emotional situation), and response modulation (e.g., expressive suppression) (Gross, 1998).\nBroadly, prior work has shown that antecedent-focused strategies like cognitive reappraisal are often more adaptive than response-focused strategies, such as expressive suppression (a type of response modulation) (Gross and John, 2003; John and Gross, 2004). Cognitive reappraisal has been associated with reduced negative affect as well as enhanced physical and psychological health, whereas expressive suppression has been shown to be associated with poorer health outcomes (Gross and John, 2003; John and Gross, 2004).\nIn addition, reappraisal itself may be further characterized and operationalized as an emotion regulation strategy as a function of multiple reappraisal tactics (McRae et al., 2012), particularly including psychological distancing and reinterpretation (Denny and Ochsner, 2014). Psychological distancing involves taking on the perspective of an impartial and objective observer and/or increasing perceived physical or temporal distance from a stress inducing stimulus or situation (Denny and Ochsner, 2014; Powers and LaBar, 2019). Alternatively, reinterpretation involves reframing the situation by imagining that the situation is not as bad as it first seemed or that the situation will soon get better (Denny and Ochsner, 2014). Previous work in\nhealthy adults has shown that, in contrast to reinterpretation training, longitudinal training in psychological distancing uniquely predicts drops in perceived stress over time, which may result from the relative stimulus independence and cognitive automatability of distancing (Denny and Ochsner, 2014). Thus, psychological distancing represents a promising emotion regulation strategy to probe in the context of stress related to COVID-19.\nPrevious research on the H1N1 pandemic showed how individual differences in adaptive behaviors were predicted by a variety of background factors like age, gender, socioeconomic status, and by personality factors like impulsivity and sensation seeking (Gaygisiz et al., 2012). Taha et al. (2014) further observed that emotion dysregulation was positively associated with anxiety during the H1N1 pandemic. Thus, in the current study we were interested to model trait-level individual differences in emotion dysregulation as well as person factors like age, gender, race/ethnicity, and socioeconomic status.\nIn order to examine associations between engagement of particular emotion regulation strategies and stress specifically related to COVID-19, in the present study we recruited a nationally representative sample of 297 individuals in the United States in May 2020 to complete a set of questionnaires assessing demographic information, trait-related emotion dysregulation; overall pandemic-related stress; and selfreports of the extent to which individuals were using a range of emotion regulation strategies during COVID-19. We predicted that engagement of reappraisal, particularly via psychological distancing, would be associated with lower pandemic-related stress, whereas other emotion regulation strategies were expected to be either unrelated or positively related to pandemic-related stress."

Participants who did not meet these criteria were excluded from participation. The projected sample size was calculated via a power analysis for a small-to-medium correlation effect size (\u03c1 = 0.2); at this effect size, 90% power (\u03b1 = 0.05) to detect an effect, two-tailed, would be achieved with 258 participants. Thus, we aimed to recruit approximately 300 participants. We recruited 298 participants. One participant was excluded from analysis due to missing emotion regulation strategy usage data, resulting in a total analyzed sample of 297 participants.

            "text": "In addition to demographic information, participants reported their perceived socioeconomic status (SES) via the MacArthur Scale of Subjective Social Status (Adler et al., 2000). Participants also completed a widely used trait-related measure of emotion dysregulation, the Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale, Short Form (DERS-SF; Gratz and Roemer, 2004; Kaufman et al., 2016). While not the focus of the current analyses, participants also completed questionnaires assessing perceived stress (Cohen et al., 1983), positive and negative affect (PANAS-SF; Watson et al., 1988), state and trait-related anxiety (STAI-6; Marteau and Bekker, 1992), depressive symptoms (CES-D; Radloff, 1977), overall reappraisal and suppression usage (ERQ; Gross and John, 2003), and quality of life (SF-36; Ware and Sherbourne, 1992).\nWe next assessed the primary dependent variable, overall perceived stress related to COVID-19. Specifically, we asked participants, \u201cHow much stress are you feeling overall right now due to COVID-19 and its impacts and consequences?\u201d Participants responded using a continuous sliding scale ranging from 0 (no stress at all) to 100 (extreme stress). This questionnaire can be found in Supplementary Figure 1.\nIn addition to this summary measure of primary interest as a dependent variable (i.e., overall COVID-19-related stress),\nwe next also assessed stress related to COVID-19 in specific domains (i.e., stress due to social isolation, uncertainty on the duration of the pandemic, concern for others\u2019 wellbeing, personal health concern, and financial hardship concern) using a continuous 0\u2013100 scale. However, these subscales for COVID-19-related stress were substantially intercorrelated with the overall COVID-19-related stress measure (Cronbach\u2019s alpha = 0.88). Thus, the overall COVID-19-related stress measure represented the dependent variable of interest for all subsequent analyses.\nFinally, we assessed the frequency with which participants engaged in a range of emotion regulation strategies derived from the Gross process model of emotion regulation (Gross, 1998). Specifically, we asked, \u201cWhen you have felt stressed due to social distancing/COVID-19, how much have you:,\u201d followed by assessment of frequency of situation selection (i.e., \u201cchanged your situation fundamentally, e.g., by traveling from a more affected area to a less affected area to reduce your risk of infection\u201d), situation modification (i.e., \u201caltered your situation to become less stressful/more normal, e.g., by engaging in virtual social interaction with friends and family via Zoom, FaceTime, etc. to try to make things feel more normal\u201d), attention redeployment/distraction (i.e., \u201cdistracted yourself from crisis-related events and information and focused your attention elsewhere, e.g., by engaging in hobbies and/or consuming non-crisis related social media and entertainment\u201d), reappraisal-by-reinterpretation (i.e., \u201cchanged how you think about the crisis itself in ways that help you feel less negative or more positive by reframing the situation in your mind, e.g., by thinking about how social distancing practices are beneficial to you and your community; contemplating how much money you may be saving on gas or other things; or thinking about how we\u2019ll pull together and get through this eventually\u201d), reappraisal by-distancing (i.e., \u201cchanged how you think about the crisis itself by trying to objectively and calmly process what\u2019s going on without judgment, e.g., by changing the way you think from a first-person, immersed perspective to a more objective, third-person perspective on the crisis\u201d), and response modulation/expressive suppression (i.e., \u201ctried to directly modify your emotional responses to the crisis, e.g., by trying not to show any outward signs of negative emotion and keeping everything inside\u201d). Responses for each question were made on a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from 1 (not at all) to 7 (very much so). Finally, we included a free-response option to assess if participants had tried any other strategies to reduce stress during COVID-19. This questionnaire can be found in Supplementary Figure 2."

            "text": "Descriptive statistics for each measure were calculated (Table 1), and raw data are registered at the Open Science Framework2. We first examined zero-order correlations among all variables (see Supplementary Table 1). Notably, frequency of situation selection, situation modification, distraction, and expressive suppression as well as extent of difficulty regulating emotion were significantly positively correlated with overall COVID19-related stress (all p < 0.05, two-tailed); no other variables showed significant zero-order correlations with overall COVID19-related stress in either direction (see Supplementary Table 1).\nWe next examined our a priori robust multiple regression model incorporating standardized regressors for all six emotion regulation strategy use frequencies as well as age, gender, community-level SES, race/ethnicity, and trait-related difficulty regulating emotion in predicting overall COVID-19-related stress. This model met all assumptions for multiple regression. The variance inflation factor for each predictor was low (all < 2.0), suggesting low multicollinearity. The data met the assumption of independent errors (Durbin-Watson value = 1.96, p = 0.36).\nRegression results for our a priori model (R2 = 0.25; Adjusted R2 = 0.22) are shown in Table 2. Greater use of situation modification was associated with greater overall COVID-19-related stress (\u03b2 = 0.20, p < 0.01, 95% CI [0.06,\n2https://osf.io/tg86c/?view_only=74f5a410dfdb4652852b12caf95edc41\n0.33]). Further, as expected, increased trait-related difficulty in regulating emotion was also significantly associated with greater overall COVID-19-related stress (\u03b2 = 0.44, p < 0.001, 95% CI [0.31, 0.57]). Conversely, greater use of distancing was unique among all emotion regulation strategies, and unique among all regression variables overall, in significantly predicting lower overall COVID-19-related stress (\u03b2 = -0.14, p < 0.05, 95% CI [-0.28, 0.00]).\nGiven that usage of distancing was unique in predicting lower overall COVID-19-related stress, we were motivated to examine an additional multiple regression model incorporating all of the regressors from the a priori model as well as separate interaction terms between distancing usage and each covariate (i.e., age, gender, community-level SES, race/ethnicity, and trait-related difficulty regulating emotion) in order to assess whether any of these demographic variables may moderate the relationship between distancing and overall COVID-19-related stress. This model met all assumptions for regression. Regression results for this model are shown in Supplementary Table 2. No interactions between distancing usage and any of the covariates above were significant (all p > 0.26; Supplementary Table 2)."

            "text": "This study investigated associations between individuals\u2019 usage of a range of emotion regulation strategies and overall stress experienced during the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to the threat of infection and illness, the toll of quarantine policies have created acute psychological consequences across the globe during the COVID-19 pandemic (Balsamo and Carlucci, 2020). The present results showed that greater usage of psychological distancing uniquely predicted lower levels of overall COVID-19-related stress. Conversely, greater usage of situation modification was significantly associated with higher levels of pandemic-related stress; while the causality of this result is unclear, it may reflect the dissonance of trying to make things feel more normal with virtual means (e.g., Zoom calls standing in as limited replacements for prior social interactions).\nFrontiers in Psychology | www.frontiersin.org 4 February 2022 | Volume 13 | Article 838507\nThe unique effect of psychological distancing in mitigating COVID-19-related stress was not moderated by age, gender, socioeconomic status, race/ethnicity, or overall difficulties regulating emotion in general, suggesting fairly broad generalizability. The present results using a United States sample are also consistent with recent work examining the relationship between psychological distancing and anxiety in Chinese participants in the context of COVID-19 (Zheng et al., 2020). Zheng and colleagues reported that psychological distancing mediated the relationship between COVID-19 severity and anxiety, with greater engagement of psychological distancing associated with diminished anxiety. Thus, it\u2019s possible that the present results may be cross-cultural as well, although future work should examine these relationships in additional cultural contexts (Carlucci et al., 2020). The present findings are also consistent with those of Jungmann and Witth\u00f6ft (2020), which reported that broadly defined adaptive emotion regulation (including reappraisal, among others) buffered pandemicrelated anxiety during COVID-19. The present results further characterize this relationship by suggesting a unique, adaptive role for distancing in particular.\nIndeed, even among reappraisal tactics (i.e., distancing and reinterpretation), distancing usage was shown to uniquely predict lower COVID-19-related stress. Reinterpretation usage was not significantly predictive of pandemic-related stress. This aligns with previous research that has identified distancing as a frequently adaptive strategy for high stress situations overall (Denny and Ochsner, 2014; Kross and Ayduk, 2017) as well as a relatively adaptive strategy for high stress situations in comparison to reinterpretation (Denny and Ochsner, 2014). As distancing is thought to represent one of the key \u201cactive ingredients\u201d driving the benefits of mindfulness practices (Kross and Ayduk, 2017), the present results suggest that distancing may be of particular relevance when used to cope with the significant stress associated with the COVID-19 pandemic."

            "text": "This present study has some limitations. It\u2019s important to note that the present results are correlational and cross-sectional. While it\u2019s plausible that emotion regulation usage may have causally impacted pandemic-related stress, such causality cannot be inferred from the present results. We also used an exploratory single item measure of COVID-19 related stress, and our emotion regulation scale was designed to assess frequency of strategy use, not degree of success in usage. Future studies may probe usage success as well as usage frequency. In addition, future studies should utilize larger sample sizes that allow for more specific modeling of gender as well as racial and ethnic differences.\nWhile correlational, the present results identify psychological distancing as a plausible causal factor and candidate psychological mechanism through which individuals regulated their COVID-related stress. These results may motivate future longitudinal, experimental work to determine if receiving training in psychological distancing may be causally related to changes in pandemic-related stress."

These findings implicate psychological distancing as a promising candidate to examine as a target in future emotion regulation training work focused on the impact of stressful situations like the COVID-19 pandemic. While the present pandemic has been profoundly challenging for individuals and society in so many ways, increased knowledge of potentially adaptive regulatory options may help people prepare to cope with current and future stressful circumstances."
