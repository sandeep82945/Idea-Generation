1. **Investigate the synergistic effects of EOF with conventional antibiotics against multidrug-resistant bacteria.** This could help to overcome antibiotic resistance and improve the efficacy of treatment for infectious diseases.


2. **Explore the potential of EOF as an eco-friendly NADPH inhibitor.** This could lead to the development of new drugs for the treatment of NADPH-related diseases, such as cancer and neurodegenerative disorders.


3. **Evaluate the in vivo antioxidant and antimicrobial activities of EOF.** This would provide more comprehensive data on the potential health benefits of EOF and help to determine its safety and efficacy for use in humans.


4. **Investigate the mechanisms of action of EOF against bacteria and fungi.** This could help to identify new targets for antimicrobial therapy and develop more effective strategies for combating infectious diseases.


5. **Conduct clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy and safety of EOF for the treatment of specific diseases.** This would provide the necessary data to support the use of EOF as a therapeutic agent in clinical practice.
