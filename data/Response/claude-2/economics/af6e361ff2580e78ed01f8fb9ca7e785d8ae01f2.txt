 Here are 5 possible future research ideas after brainstorming the given paper:

1. Conduct longitudinal studies evaluating changes in food choice motives over time as the post-pandemic era evolves. Track how motives like price, convenience, health, etc. change in importance over the next 3-5 years. 

2. Examine how different demographic groups (age, gender, income level, etc.) differ in their food choice motives during and after the pandemic. Identify the most vulnerable groups to target for interventions.

3. Develop and validate a comprehensive questionnaire or scale to measure the 10 food choice motives identified in the paper. Use it to assess motives and correlate with actual dietary intake.  

4. Test interventions, educational campaigns, or policies aimed at influencing specific food choice motives in different populations. Assess their effectiveness in improving diet quality.

5. Conduct cross-cultural studies to compare how food choice motives during and after COVID-19 differ between individualist and collectivist cultures, or between developing and developed nations.
