Long-term In Vivo Studies on AABP-2B: Investigate the long-term effects of AABP-2B consumption in animal models to assess its safety, efficacy in modulating gut microbiota, and impact on host health over time. These studies could help translate in vitro findings to more applicable in vivo contexts, including potential impacts on obesity, diabetes, and inflammation-related diseases.

Clinical Trials in Humans: Initiate clinical trials to evaluate the effects of AABP-2B consumption on human gut microbiota composition, metabolic health, and glycemic control. This could include studying its effects on individuals with metabolic syndromes or diabetes to assess its potential as a therapeutic dietary supplement.

Mechanistic Studies of AABP-2B Interaction with Gut Microbiota: Delve deeper into the molecular mechanisms underlying the interaction between AABP-2B and gut microbiota. This could involve studying specific microbial enzymes responsible for fermenting AABP-2B, and how this fermentation process influences the production of short-chain fatty acids and their health benefits.

Comparative Studies with Other Prebiotics: Compare the efficacy of AABP-2B with other known prebiotics in modulating gut microbiota, enhancing metabolic health, and controlling glycemic responses. Such studies could help position AABP-2B within the broader context of dietary interventions for gut health.

Investigation into AABP-2B's Role in Immune Modulation: Given the gut microbiota's crucial role in immune function, future research could explore how AABP-2B influences immune responses. This could involve studying its impact on the maturation of immune cells, production of anti-inflammatory compounds, and its potential to enhance resistance against intestinal pathogens.
