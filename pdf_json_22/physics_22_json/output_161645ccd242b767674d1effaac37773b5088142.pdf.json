            "text": "A it is well\u2014known, General Relativity is incompatible with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle in the sense that, obtaining an accurately measurement of the position requires a large amount of energy which, eventually, could lead to the breaking\u2013 down of the space\u2013time structure. In the past decades, several efforts have made with the aim to define a Generalized uncertainty principle (GUP)1\u20133 (see also,4\u20136 for recent developments) to avoid such singularities in the energy sector of GR. One interesting feature about GUP proposals it that they lead to a model\u2013independent way to deduce the discreetness of the space-time.7 Consequently, the deformed canonical commutation relations which arise from the particular GUP under consideration,\n1\nar X\niv :2\n30 2.\n09 13\n7v 1\n[ gr\n-q c]\n1 7\nFe b\n20 23\nhave been used to compute corrections of the energy shift of the hydrogen atom spectrum, the Lamb shift, the Landau levels, and the Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM).2,8\u201310 Besides, based on the Heisenberg microscope argument, is possible to find an expression for the temperature of a black hole (BH) which deviates from the standard formula for the Hawking temperature.8,11,12 Recently, with the aim to investigate both static and spherically symmetric and Kerr-Newman BHs in the context of GUP, in Ref.13 the authors considered a GUP\u2013corrected BH temperature to obtain a modified Van der Waals BH.\nThe study of BH thermodynamics can be traced back to the seminal works by Bekenstein14,15 and Hawking16 setting the basis for the interpretation of the gravity as an emergent phenomena. In recent developments, it has been demonstrated that the role played by the cosmological constant as a pressure, leads to the realization that BH thermodynamics is much richer than previously thought. The analysis of the resulting BH thermodynamics leads to the extended phase space (EPS) approach. In this work, we follow the route developed in13 in order to obtain the GUP corrected solutions for Polytropic BH17 and Chaplygin BH18 obtained through the EPS approach.\nThis work is organized as follows. In Chapter 2, the theoretical background contains two main sections. On one hand, the section 3 is a review of the extended phase space, which introduces negative cosmological constant as thermodynamic pressure. On the other hand, the section 3 is a review of the independent result GUP and some possible physical modifications. In Chapter 4, we develop the GUP thermodynamics strategy and we calculate black hole asymptotic GUP corrections for Polytropic BH and Chaplygin BH. In Chapter 5, we calculate thermodynamic quantities to determine the stability of the GUP corrected solutions. Finally, the last Chapter 6 contains final comments and beyond perspectives of this work."

            "text": "As it is well known the basic thermodynamic quantities of a physical system have their counterpart in BH physics. For example, for a Schwarzschild BH the mass is related to the energy, the surface gravity is related to the temperature and the horizon area is associated with the entropy of the system. However, for non\u2013vacuum solutions where pressure and volume terms are introduced19 the above correspondence is not suitable to describe BH thermodynamics. For example, when considering asymptotically AdS BHs, the mass must be identified with the enthalpy of system20,21 and the cosmological constant as the thermodynamic pressure, namely.19,22\nP = \u2212 \u039b 8\u03c0 = 3 8\u03c0l2 . (1)\nThe set of thermodynamic variables which satisfies the laws of BH thermodynamics is known as extended phase space. In terms of these variables, the first law of BH\nthermodynamics reads,\n\u03b4M = T\u03b4S + V \u03b4P + ..., (2)\nwhere\nV = \u2202M\n\u2202P \u2223\u2223\u2223\u2223 S , (3)\nis the associated thermodynamic volume.\nTo fix ideas, let us consider the metric\nds2 = \u2212fdt2 + f\u22121dr2 + r2(d\u03b82 + sin2 \u03b8d\u03c62), (4)\nwith\nf = \u22122M r + r2 l2 \u2212 h(r, P ), (5)\nto ensure an asymptotically AdS solution of the Einstein field equations, which read\nG\u00b5\u03bd + \u039bg\u00b5\u03bd = 8\u03c0T\u00b5\u03bd , (6)\nwhere, the energy momentum tensor is defined as\nT\u00b5\u03bd = diag(\u2212%, pr, p\u22a5, p\u22a5). (7)\nNow, by using Eqs. (4), (6) and (7) we obtain\n% = \u2212pr = 1\u2212 f \u2212 rf \u2032\n8\u03c0r2 + P, (8)\np\u22a5 = rf \u2032\u2032 + 2f \u2032\n16\u03c0r \u2212 P, (9)\nwhich results in a system of two equations for three unknowns, {f, %, p\u22a5}. Furthermore, the physical acceptability of the solution is restricted by the energy conditions, namely the null (NEC), weak (WEC), strong (SEC) and dominant (DEC) energy conditions,\n%+ p\u22a5 \u2265 0, (10) % \u2265 0, and %+ p\u22a5 \u2265 0, (11) 2p\u22a5 \u2265 0, and %+ p\u22a5 \u2265 0, (12) % \u2265 0, and % \u2265 |p\u22a5|, (13)\nrespectively.\nNow, if we were solving the Einstein field equations in the usual way, the next step should be to propose an equation of state between the variables of the matter sector. However, we can follow an alternative protocol which consists in proposing an equation of state (EoS) for the pressure P and then use the equations of BH thermodynamics to solve the system. At this point, some comments are in order. First note that from the horizon condition, f(r+) = 0, we obtain\nM = 4\u03c0\n3 r3+P \u2212 r+ 2 h(r+, P ). (14)\nThen, for Eq. (2), the thermodynamic volume reads\nV =\n( \u2202M\n\u2202P ) S = 4\u03c0 3 r3+ \u2212 r+ 2 \u2202h(r+, P ) \u2202P . (15)\nSimilarly, the temperature can be expressed as\nT = f \u2032(r+, P )\n4\u03c0 = 2r+P \u2212\nh(r+, P ) 4\u03c0r+ \u2212 1 4\u03c0 \u2202h(r+, P ) \u2202r+ . (16)\nFinally, we consider the well established Bekenstein-Hawking entropy given by\nS = A\n4 = \u03c0r2+. (17)\nNote that, in order to close the system of equations, an EoS for the pressure P must be provided. In the next section, we shall explore some of the equations of state that have been proposed so far to obtain asymptotically AdS BH solutions.\n2.1. Polytropic BH\nIn this section we will consider a polytropic EoS (see Ref.,17 for details), namely\nP = K\u03c11+ 1 n ; \u03c1 = K\u2212 n n+1P n n+1 = CP n n+1 , (18)\nwhere n is the Polytropic index and K and C are constants, related as\nC = K\u2212 n n+1 . (19)\nAdditionally, it is assumed that the gas satisfies the following integrability condition\n\u22022S\n\u2202T\u2202V =\n\u22022S\n\u2202V \u2202T , (20)\nfrom where, in accordance with the first law of thermodynamics, we obtain\nS = P + \u03c1\nT V. (21)\nIn order to proceed, we will consider the following ansatz, proposed in:17\nh(r, P ) = A(r)\u2212B(r)P +D(r)P 1 1+n . (22)\nThen, by using the thermodynamic relations (15), (16) and (17), the polytropic EoS (18), and the first law (21), we obtain\nF1(r) + F2(r)P + F3(r)P 1 1+n + F4(r)P n 1+n = 0, (23)\nwhere F1, F2, F3 and F4 are functions o A(r), B(r), D(r) and their derivatives. Now, by setting the condition F4(r) = 0, we obtain\nB(r) = \u22128\u03c0r 2\n3 + rB0. (24)\nThen, the condition F3(r) = 0 leads to\nD(r) = D0[(n+ 1)r] 1\u2212n n+1 . (25)\nIt is worth mentioning that the solution (24) is consistent with the remaining equation, F2(r) = 0. Finally, by imposing F1(r) = 0, the function A(r) reads\nA(r) = A0 r +D0C[(n+ 1)r] 1\u2212n n+1 . (26)\nWith these results at hand, the function h(r, P ) takes the form\nh(r, P ) = A0 r + r2 l2 \u2212 3B0r 8\u03c0l2 +D0\n[ C + ( 3\n8\u03c0l2\n) 1 n+1 ] (n+ 1) 1\u2212n n+1 r 1\u2212n n+1 (27)\nFinally, as stated in,17 we need to impose A0 = B0 = 0 and D0 = { l2 [ C +(\n3 8\u03c0l2\n) 1 n+1 ] (n+ 1) 1\u2212n n+1 }\u22121 for n = \u2212 13 , to have the asymptotically AdS behaviour.\n2.2. Chaplygin BH\nA different possibility is to consider the Chaplygin EoS and then to follow the same steps used in the polytropic case as done in Ref.18 To be more precise, we start from\nP = A\u03c1\u2212 B \u03c1n , (28)\nwhere A, B and n are constants. Note that in this case, the extended phase space formalism remains applicable with a modification in the volume,\nV =\n( \u2202M\n\u2202P ) S = 4\u03c0 3 r3+ \u2212 r+ 2 \u2202h(r+, \u03c1) \u2202\u03c1 \u2202\u03c1 \u2202P . (29)\nNext, as reported in,18 the ansatz for h is taken as\nh(r, \u03c1) = X(r) + Y (r)\u03c1+ Z(r)\u03c1\u2212n, (30)\nfrom where, following the same steps as in the polytropic case, we obtain a polynomial equation of the form\nF0 + F1\u03c1+ F2(r)\u03c1 \u2212n + F3(r)\u03c1 \u2212n\u22121\n+F4(r)\u03c1 \u22122n\u22121 = 0 (31)\nSetting the condition F0(r) = F3(r) = 0 leads to\nX(r) = X0 r . (32)\nNow, from F4(r) = 0 we obtain\nY (r) = 8\n3 \u03c0Ar2 + Y0r 2 A+1, (33)\nand from F2(r) = 0 we have\nZ(r) = \u22128 3 \u03c0Br2 + rZ0. (34)\nUsing (33) and (34) in F1(r) = 0, results in\nA = \u2212 n 1 + n . (35)\nFinally, replacing the results (32), (33), (34) and (35) in Eq. (30), the expression for h(r, \u03c1) reads\nh(r, \u03c1) = X0 r + r2 l2 + \u03c1Y0r \u2212 2n\u22121\n\u2212 3rZ0 8\u03c0Bl2 \u2212 n\u03c1rZ0 B(n+ 1) , (36)\nwhere X0, Y0, and Z0 that should be set X0 = Z0 = 0, Y0 = 8\u03c0P 3\u03c1 , and n = \u2212 2 3 in order to ensure the asymptotically AdS behaviour.18\nBefore concluding this section, we would like to emphasize the importance of the extended phase space formalism as an alternative protocol in obtaining asymptotically AdS BH\u2019s. Note that, given an equation of state for the pressure P , we can use equations (15), (16) and (17) to determine the metric instead of solving Einstein field equations directly. However, the results obtained depend on how both the temperature and entropy are written in terms of the metric and coordinates so that, any modification in such quantities would lead to different results. In this work we shall assume a GUP\u2013corrected temperature to solve Eqs. (15), (16) and (17) following the same steps that let us to Eqs. (27), (36)."

Minimal Length Uncertainty\nAs it is well known, the GUP states that the fundamental commutator is modified as\n[xi, pj ] = i~[\u03b4ij(1 + \u03b1p2) + 2\u03b1pipj ], (37)\nwith\n[xi, xj ] = 0 = [pi, pj ], (38)\nbeing \u03b1 a positive constant, called the GUP parameter.\nNow, we can define\nxi = x0i (39) pj = p0j(1 + \u03b1p 2 0), (40)\nwhere [x0i, p0j ] = i~\u03b4ij . Furthermore, p0j is interpreted as the momentum at low energy scale which is represented by p0j = \u2212i~ \u2202\u2202x0j , while pj is considered as the momentum a high energy scales. Now the GUP reads\n\u2206x\u2206p \u2265 ~ + \u03b1 ~ \u2206p2. (41)\nNote that, after solving the quadratic equation for \u2206p, we obtain\n\u2206p \u2265 ~ 2\u03b1\n( \u2206x\u2212 \u221a \u2206x2 \u2212 4\u03b1 ) , (42)\nfrom where\n\u2206p \u2265 ~ \u2206x + ~\u03b1 \u2206x3 +O(\u03b12). (43)\nThe above result corresponds to the quadratic minimal length approach.\n3.2. BH temperature and entropy GUP\u2013corrected\nIn this section, we introduce a generalization of the BH temperature and entropy modified by GUP as reported in Refs.13,23,24 To this end, we expand (43) up to second order, namely\n\u2206A \u2265 \u2206x\u2206p ' ~ ( 1 + \u03b1\n\u2206x2\n) \u2261 ~\u2032. (44)\nNow, as it is well known, the thermodynamic BH temperature associated with the surface gravity \u03ba, is given by\nT = dA dS \u00d7 \u03ba 8\u03c0 , (45)\nwhere\ndA dS ' (\u2206A)min (\u2206S)min = \u03b3 ln2 ~ ( 1 + \u03b1 \u2206x2 ) = ~\u2032\u03b3 ln2 . (46)\nThen, replacing the relation (46) into (45), we obtain\nT = ~\u2032\u03b3 ln2 \u00d7 \u03ba 8\u03c0 = ~\u2032\u03ba 2\u03c0 , (47)\nwhere we have taken \u03b3 = 4ln2. Finally, after replacing the surface gravity \u03ba in the above expression, the GUP\u2013corrected temperature reads\nT = ( 1 + \u03b1\n4r2+\n) f \u2032(r+, P )\n4\u03c0\n= ( 1 + \u03b1\n4r2+\n)( 2r+P \u2212 h(r+, P )\n4\u03c0r+ \u2212 1 4\u03c0 \u2202h(r+, P ) \u2202r+\n) . (48)\nNote that, in the limit \u03b1 \u2192 0, the expression for the temperature reduces to T = \u03ba 2\u03c0 , as expected. As a consequence, the entropy calculated with (48) acquires a logarithmic correction given by13,25\nS =\n\u222b dM\nT = \u03c0r2+ \u2212\n\u03b1\u03c0\n4 log\n( 4r2+ + \u03b1\n\u03b1\n) . (49)\nIn the following sections, we will use the GUP\u2013corrected temperature (48) and entropy (49) within the extended phase space formalism, in order to obtain GUP corrected asymptotically AdS BH solutions."

In order to do so, we replace the corrected entropy (49) and temperature (48) in the first law (21) to obtain a polynomial equation of the form F1(r) + F2(r)P + F3(r)P 1 1+n + F4(r)P n 1+n = 0, where\nF1(r) = CrD(r) 2(n+ 1) \u2212 \u03b1+ 4r\n2\n16\n( A\u2032 + A\nr\n) .

(52)\nF4(r) = \u2212 1 2 KrB \u2212 4 3 \u03c0Kr3. (53)\nIn order to solve the system of equations, lets us impose F4 = 0 to obtain\nB(r) = \u22128\u03c0r 2\n3 . (54)\nAlternatively, we solve for the function B, but by setting the condition F2 = 0,\nB(r) = \u22128\u03c0r 2 3 + B0(\u03b1+ 4r 2) r . (55)\nThus, we conclude that B0 = 0 in order to avoid inconsistencies. Next, by taking the F2 = 0 and solving the differential equation we obtain\nD(r) = D0(\u03b1+ 4r\n2) 1 n+1\nr . (56)\nFinally, after imposing F1 = 0 we obtain\nA(r) = A0 r + D0C(\u03b1+ 4r\n2) 1 n+1\nr . (57)\nThen, replacing (54), (56), and (57) into the ansatz (22), the function h(r, P ) reads\nh(r, P ) = A0 r + r2 l2 \u2212 3B0r 2\u03c0l2\n( 1 + \u03b1\n4r2\n) + D0(\u03b1+ 4r 2) 1 n+1\nr\n[( 3\n8\u03c0l2\n) 1 n+1\n+ C ] .(58)\nFinally, after replacing (58) in equation (5) we arrive to the final result.

(60)\nNote that the AdS structure can be recovered by taking the limit \u03b1\u2192 0. In Figure 1 we show the function f for certain parameters. Note that the position of the event horizon increases as the the cosmological pressure decreases.\nUsing the above results, the matter sector reads\n% = \u2212pr = P + 1 8\u03c0r2 \u2212 P \u221a \u03b1+ 4r2 2r .

In this sense, it is worth noticing that GUP corrections do not alter these energy conditions as in the non-corrected case reported in.17\n4.2. Minimal length GUP\u2013corrected Chaplygin BH\nIn this section, we follow the same strategy implemented in section 2.2 but this time we assume\nP = \u2212 B \u03c1n , (63)\nwhich corresponds to set A = 0 in (28). It is worth mentioning that GUP corrections of Chaplygin EoS (28) result in very complex differential equations and for this reason, we work with the simplified version. The resulting polynomial equation takes the form F0(r) +F1(r)\u03c1+F2(r)\u03c1 \u2212n +F3(r)\u03c1 n+2 = 0, with the corresponding associated functions defined as,\nF0 = \u2212 \u03b1(rX \u2032 +X)(\u03b1+ 4r2)\n64r3\n[ 4r2\n\u03b1 \u2212 log\n( 1 + 4r2\n\u03b1\n)] .

(67)\nSolving for the function X by setting the state F0 = 0, we obtain\nX(r) = X0 r .

(69)\nUsing (69) in (65), and replacing the result to solve for the function Y by imposing F1 = 0, we have\nY (r) = \u2212 nZ0 B(n+ 1)\n[ 4r \u2212 \u03b1\nr log\n( 1 + 4r2\n\u03b1 )] + Y0 r [ 4r2 \u2212 \u03b1 log ( 1 + 4r2 \u03b1 )]\u2212 1n .

(71)\nFinally, we determine the metric function by introducing the solution (71) in the equation (5). In order to conserve the AdS behavior, we define the values for the constants as X0 = Z0 = 0, Y0 = 1 3\u03c0P ( \u2212PB ) 1 n and n = \u2212 23 , as a result\nh = P8\u03c0r2 3 \u2212 P\u03c0 3r\n[ 4r2 \u2212 \u03b1 log ( 4r2\n\u03b1 + 1\n)]3/2 (72)\nf = \u22122M r + P\u03c0 3r\n[ 4r2 \u2212 \u03b1 log ( 4r2\n\u03b1 + 1\n)]3/2 . (73)\nIn this expression, if we take the limit \u03b1 \u2192 0 then the AdS structure is recovered, as expected. In Figure 4, we display the solution f as a function of r for some values of P .\nFinally, the matter sector for this solution reads\n% = P + 1\n8\u03c0r2 \u2212\n2Pr \u221a 4r2 \u2212 \u03b1 log ( 4r2 \u03b1 + 1 )\n\u03b1+ 4r2 (74) p\u22a5 = \u2212P + 4P ( 8r5 + 3\u03b1r3 ) (\u03b1+ 4r2) 2 \u221a 4r2 \u2212 \u03b1 log ( 4r2 \u03b1 + 1 )\n\u2212 \u03b1Pr\n( 3\u03b1+ 4r2 ) log ( 4r2 \u03b1 + 1 )\n(\u03b1+ 4r2) 2 \u221a 4r2 \u2212 \u03b1 log ( 4r2 \u03b1 + 1 ) , (75)\nshowing, in Figure 5, that it satisfies the DEC."

Among all the possibilities, we choose the study of the heat capacity phase transitions. Now for reference, we are going to define the procedure in the context of extended phase space without GUP. Then in the following sections, we will promote the obtained results to the GUP versions, and we apply the GUP corrected solutions from previous sections.\nThe heat capacity establishes the thermodynamics stability: a positive heat capacity corresponds to the thermodynamically stable state and a negative heat capacity to the unstable state. If the transition between states is smooth, it corresponds to a first order phase transition. In contrast, a discontinuity in the heat capacity is associated to second order phase transition. The heat capacity of the black hole26,27 is defined as\nCp =\n( \u2202M\n\u2202T ) P = T ( \u2202S \u2202T ) P , (76)\nat the horizon r = rh.

To be more precise, we used the minimal length corrections provided by the generalized uncertainty principle to modify the black hole temperature and entropy in the first law of the black hole thermodynamics and we close the system by assuming a suitable equation of state for the cosmological pressure which arises in the context of the extended phase space. In particular, we analyzed the corrections induced on both the Polytropic and Chaplygin black holes. In the Plytropic case, we found that the corrections does not modify the energy conditions fulfilled by the original solution but the system undergoes a second order phase transition for any value of the GUP parameter. In contrast, for the Chaplying case the corrected solution satisfies only the dominant energy condition but its heat capacity is always positive.\nIt is worth mentioning that, on one hand, the solutions we obtained can be thought as semi\u2013classical black holes in the sense that we have incorporated some\nquantum corrections through the thermodynamics via a GUP-corrected temperature. In this regard, as the GUP leads to universal corrections, it should be interesting if our solutions can be obtained in the framework of other approaches of quantum gravity as Loop Quantum Gravity, for example. On the other hand, for this work we only review the quadratic minimal length corrections. The combination of other possible corrections could result in unexplored families of BH solutions. This and other features are left for future works."
