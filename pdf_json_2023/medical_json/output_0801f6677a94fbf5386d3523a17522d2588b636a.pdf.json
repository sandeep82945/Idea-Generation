    "abstractText": "Objective. To determine the level of knowledge and factors affecting knowledge and satisfaction with diabetes care among persons with diabetes at urban health centre (UHC) and community health worker (CHW)-led outreach clinics (ORC) in South India. Methodology. A cross-sectional study was carried out using a structured questionnaire. One hundred patients at the UHC and 200 patients at the ORC were included. Results. Patients with DM of more than eight years, with co-morbidities and maintained on insulin had good knowledge at the UHC. At the ORC, participants who received education beyond the primary level and belonging to non Hindu religion had higher knowledge. Patients at the ORC experienced better satisfaction in terms of waiting time for appointments, consultation, registration system and counselling. At the UHC, those who received primary education or those with lower educational attainment had better satisfaction. Overall, knowledge (p = 0.03) and satisfaction (p = 0.00001) of diabetes care was better at the ORC than at the UHC. Conclusions. Our study found better knowledge and satisfaction with diabetes care at the ORC than at the UHC. Whether or not the difference can be attributed to CHW-based clinics in the community needs to be further elucidated.",

In 2021, the worldwide number of people with diabetes has been estimated to be 536.6 million. India has 74.2 million people with diabetes and the number is estimated to rise to 124.9 million by 2045.1 The International Diabetes Federation reports that one in seven adults with diabetes come from India.1 The median annual direct and indirect costs for diabetes care in India is estimated at 25.391 INR ($525.5) and 4970 INR ($102.8), respectively.2\nComprehensive management of diabetes involves active participation of patients in making significant lifestyle modifications.3 Medication adherence, treatment compliance, self-monitoring of blood sugar and followup with their physicians entail long-term commitment from patients and their families.4 Adherence is the degree to which the person\u2019s behavior is consistent with the\nrecommendations and compliance is the extent to which a patient\u2019s behavior matches the prescriber\u2019s advice.5 These self-care behaviors are found to be associated with improved glycemic control and reduction in the incidence of complications.\nThe cognitive evaluation of whether or not a treatment regimen meets the patient\u2019s subjective expectations is termed as treatment satisfaction, which may influence treatment adherence in patients with diabetes.6 A Palestinian study documented that patients with moderate satisfaction had greater adherence to medication and had better quality of life.7 Treatment adherence has also been found to be related to patient-provider communication. Poor communication was found to be associated with inadequate medication adherence, particularly for oral hypoglycemics.8\nKnowledge related to diabetes is important to improve self-care and self-monitoring of blood sugar among patients with diabetes. However, poor knowledge of the\n________________________________________\neISSN 2308-118x (Online) Printed in the Philippines Copyright \u00a9 2023 by Lovelina et al. Received: September 3, 2022.

However, not all patients from these communities seek care at the UHC. The clinical services at the UHC and the ORCs are subsidized by the tertiary care center. The UHC is managed by a team comprising of physicians trained in Family Medicine, Community Medicine, post graduate trainees and junior medical officers.\nThe UHC has a capacity of 46 inpatient beds, two beds in the labor room and an operating room, and the center also includes laboratory and pharmacy services. It provides daily ambulatory care, weekly antenatal services in addition to the ORCs serving the local urban communities. Approximately 180-200 patients seek healthcare daily in the out-patient department (OPD) at the UHC.\nThe outreach services involve community engagement through community volunteers. Population demographics and prevalence of non-communicable diseases in the community served by the ORCs are reported by the CHW. A population of nearly 12,000 is served in these communities, of which approximately 1000 of them have one or more non-communicable diseases.\nSample size and sampling technique\nBased on the assumption that at least 50% of the participants have adequate knowledge and are satisfied with the care, a relative precision of 20% was utilized, and the required sample size was calculated using the formula 4 pq/d2. The sample size was determined to be 100 for each setting. Hence, 100 patients with diabetes from UHC and 200 patients (50 each from different communities) from the ORC were enrolled in the study. They were selected randomly from the list of patients with diabetes seeking care at the UHC or at the ORC. There was no duplication of participants."

Those who were acutely ill were not included in the study. Data Sources, measurement and statistical analysis\nA structured questionnaire was developed by the investigators. Face-face interviews with eligible participants were conducted by the investigators to capture the data of demographics, knowledge and satisfaction with diabetes care.\nThe knowledge section had a maximum score of 14 and minimum score of 0. Those whose correct answers were more than 11 (>80%) were considered as having good knowledge, 7-11 (50-79%) as having average knowledge and less than 7 (<50%) as having poor knowledge of diabetes care.\nrisk factors for developing diabetes is well documented in Indian literature.9 An Ethiopian study observed that those who were illiterate and had diabetes for less than five years had low knowledge regarding diabetes, thus affecting their compliance and adherence.10 Other factors found to be associated with poor knowledge of diabetes include age, marital status, occupation and family history of diabetes.11 A Bangladesh study identified female gender and lower income as factors contributing to the low level of knowledge regarding diabetes.12 Of the many interventions, health education is one of the proven costeffective, scalable interventions to improve the knowledge on diabetes in developing countries.13\nDiabetes care is a significant part of the ambulatory and inpatient services of the urban health centre (UHC) where this study was conducted. About 40% of the out-patient visits to the UHC comprise of care related to diabetes.14 Nearly 500 patients were admitted during the years 2020-2021 due to diabetes and diabetes-related problems.15\nThe UHC provides primary and secondary level healthcare services to the low-resource urban communities. Outreach clinics (ORCs) were initiated in 2016 to improve accessibility in the low-income areas of the community. The entire population of the community was enlisted by the community health worker (CHW) assigned to the community. Community-based health education sessions are routinely conducted by the CHW and community health nurse (CHN). One assigned team consisting of a physician, CHN, CHW and social worker (SW) provide healthcare services to a particular community. Besides running the weekly clinics, the CHWs screen asymptomatic patients, assess post-hospitalised patients and those who are not compliant to medications.\nThis study was undertaken to measure the factors associated with the knowledge and satisfaction related to diabetes care at the UHC and ORCs."

The scoping review on CHW-based diabetes care included 54 articles primarily from developed countries.16 The roles of a CHW are captured in the triad of education, support and advocacy. Our study provides evidence on the role of CHW in improving the knowledge of diabetes care in low-resource communities in developing countries.\nOur study found the duration and type of treatment for diabetes and prevalence of co-morbidities of participants at the UHC and the ORCs to be similar. The higher proportion of participants who received more than primary education and who belonged to the Hindu religion in the ORCs is representative of the communities served by the ORCs. It is interesting that the number of visits of participants to the UHC and the ORCs were equal, though ORCs run weekly in the community to improve accessibility. It may not be possible to determine the health-seeking behavior of participants as they may also seek healthcare from government or other private health care systems. A community-based study in Indonesia found that no demographic factors were significantly associated with the health-seeking behavior of patients.21 Still, health-seeking behavior plays a vital role in the management of noncommunicable diseases.\nApproximately 50% of our study participants are in the age group of 45-60 years with half of them diagnosed with diabetes for more than five years. A tertiary care-based study in Gujarat found the mean age of the patient population to be more than 60 years.22 Majority of the participants are women who are dependent on family members and neighbors to accompany them to the health center. This may partially explain their health-seeking behavior. Our literature review found evidence for the influence of gender and lower income on the knowledge of diabetes.12 The greater proportion of women in our study probably accounts for the sub-optimal knowledge on diabetes that is likely to influence their health-seeking behavior. Similar evidence is documented on the influence of socio-demographic and socioeconomic conditions on glycemic control and health outcomes.23\nwere satisfied with the care provided at the ORC than at the UHC. The knowledge on diabetes care (p = 0.03) and satisfaction with care (p = 0.00001) were statistically better at the ORC as compared to the UHC as seen in Figure 1. There is a significant difference in the mean scores of satisfaction with care (p = 0.00001) between the UHC and the ORC. There is no significant difference in the mean knowledge scores in both the settings (Figure 2)."

            "text": "Amidst the rising incidence of diabetes in low-and-middleincome countries, there are challenges in implementing quality diabetes care to large communities due to complex factors. Accordingly, CHW are roped in globally to improve accessibility to diabetes care.16\nResearch on the role of CHWs in the delivery of diabetes care is rapidly accumulating. A systematic review on CHWled diabetes care concluded that more research is needed to understand the role of CHWs in disease awareness, behavioral change and health outcomes.17 Our study evaluated the knowledge and satisfaction of diabetes care delivered through CHWs in comparison to those who accessed care for diabetes directly at the UHC in lowresource urban communities.\nIn our study, knowledge and satisfaction of diabetes care was significantly better in the ORCs. Both systems (UHC and ORCs) had similar results in relation to interaction with doctors, nurses and pharmacists. Physician communication was found to improve patient satisfaction in various studies, particularly in primary care practices in Saudi Arabia, Japan and Qatar.18-20 In addition to physician communication, treatment satisfaction is reported to be associated with receiving guidance on exercise therapy and tailored pharmacological therapy.20 The system factors of waiting time for registration and consultation with doctors and nurses are found to be better in the ORCs. This is likely to be due to the system of having an assigned team consisting of physicians, CHN, CHWs for each community and the established system of follow-up for patients.\nIn our system of CHN-supervised, CHW-based diabetes care that is linked to the UHC, the CHWs are the vital link to the community. CHWs engage patients through\nVol. 38 No. 2 November 2023\n48\nwww.asean-endocrinejournal.org\nLerisha Lovelina, et al Knowledge and Satisfaction with Care Among Persons with DM"

            "text": "Our study identified sub-optimal knowledge of diabetes care among study participants. In comparison, better knowledge and satisfaction with care was found at the ORC than at the UHC though no major difference was identified in terms of their socio-demographics or in the number of visits. At the UHC, better knowledge was found to be associated with longer duration of diabetes, presence of co-morbidities and use of insulin. At the ORC, better knowledge was found to be associated with receiving more than primary school education and belonging to non-Hindu religion. At the UHC, patients with lower educational attainment were found to have higher satisfaction with care. There was no association between age, gender, religion, education, occupation, duration of diabetes, presence of comorbidities, number of clinic visits, and type of treatment with satisfaction with care at the ORC. Overall, the system factors of waiting time for registration, consultation with doctors and nurses were more favorable in the ORCs."

            "text": "Comprehensive data collection on the factors influencing knowledge and satisfaction of diabetes care at the UHC and at the ORCs was performed.\nIt is a cross-sectional study. Patients who were former clients at the UHC or at the ORCs were not included in the study. Only those who were eligible based on the inclusion criteria were included. There was no duplication of participants from the UHC or ORC.\nSample size was reached by recruiting participants randomly. Participants who were included are representative of the communities in the ORCs and those who seek care at the UHC. Participants may not be representative of the general population in the society as the UHC and ORCs focus on the low-resource communities.\nThe UHC and the ORCs are financially supported by a private academic tertiary care hospital to provide subsidized care for the low-resource communities. The generalisbility of the results to other health care systems in India may be questionable.\nAs the data was collected by the co-investigators, patients may not have been forthcoming with their thoughts especially with regard to satisfaction with care. The structured questionnaire was developed locally.\nThe pandemic affected the accessibility of care at both centers."

A very small proportion of our participants are on insulin. This is similar to what was reported during our audit in 2013 and similar to what is found in literature.24,25 Most international guidelines based on studies from the West are not applicable to LMIC due to epidemiological, cultural and socio-economic variations. Diabetes is an expensive disease.26 Often, government healthcare services provide only two to three OADs, and variable supply of insulin. Most of our patients pay out-of-pocket for treatment. There are also challenges in terms of storage facilities for insulin.\nOur study identified sub-optimal knowledge of many factors related to diabetes care in the UHC and in the ORC. Better knowledge on medication and annual screening tests among participants completing middle school is identified in the ORC. This is similar to the Ethiopian study in which 43% of the study participants were identified as illiterate. Yet, more than 50% of them demonstrated good knowledge, attitude and practice towards glycemic control.27 Better knowledge of diabetes care is found among patients with longer duration of diabetes and those on insulin in the UHC. Similar results were reported in Pakistan where universitylevel education and the type of therapy was associated with better knowledge of the disease.28 The results of our study reiterate the need for health education relevant to the context of our communities.\nOur results of better knowledge and satisfaction with diabetes care at the ORCs is related to the multiple factors at the ORCs that favor patient-centered care. The same team of CHW, CHN and physician assigned to each ORC facilitated better communication and continuity of care by the healthcare team. Patients within the same community foster emotional and social support in accessing the healthcare team for emergencies and screening. A systematic review on the effects of continuity of care on health outcomes of patients with diabetes found decreased mortality, complications and health service utilisation.29 A Taiwanese study reported similar results on continuity of care for patients with diabetes.30\nOur study in lower socio-economic communities illustrated the unique challenges faced in such settings. CHW-led diabetes care is a viable alternative to improve accessibility of services for low- resource communities. The role of CHWs and CHN should focus on patient-centered education, support to improve accessibility and advocacy for patients in the community. Patient-centred education should emphasise healthy lifestyle, self-care, healthseeking behaviour, medication adherence and treatment compliance. Health education is one of the proven scalable interventions to address the health-seeking behaviour and the social milieu of patients and to lessen the costs of diabetes care. Health education emphasising prevention and patient-centred care is likely to be one of the most cost-effective strategies in the Indian context.\nVol. 38 No. 2 November 2023\n49\nwww.asean-endocrinejournal.org\nLerisha Lovelina, et alKnowledge and Satisfaction with Care Among Persons with DM\n2014;3(4):362-7.
