    "abstractText": "We characterize the low-lying excitations of a quantum vortex in a quasi-two-dimensional BoseEinstein condensate (BEC) using the standard definition of the density of states (DOS) and a modified version that is sensitive to complementary aspects of the excitation\u2019s spectrum. The latter proves to be particularly relevant to studying the polaronic state realized when an impurity is embedded in a quantum vortex. We establish that the impurity becomes sensitive to the transversal fluctuations of the vortex, via its remnant kelvon mode, and to the phase fluctuations of the BEC Nambu-Goldstone mode. The presence of the vortex yields an anomalous excitation spectrum with a finite energy gap and non-linear DOS at low energies. We find that the high sensitivity of the kelvon mode to external potentials provides a channel of quantum-level control over impurities trapped in a vortex. This extra control channel may be of practical use for the proposal of using vortex-trapped impurities as qubit units for quantum information processing.",

Terc\u0327as2\n1CeFEMA, Instituto Superior Te\u0301cnico, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal 2IPFN, Instituto Superior Te\u0301cnico, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal\nWe characterize the low-lying excitations of a quantum vortex in a quasi-two-dimensional BoseEinstein condensate (BEC) using the standard definition of the density of states (DOS) and a modified version that is sensitive to complementary aspects of the excitation\u2019s spectrum. The latter proves to be particularly relevant to studying the polaronic state realized when an impurity is embedded in a quantum vortex. We establish that the impurity becomes sensitive to the transversal fluctuations of the vortex, via its remnant kelvon mode, and to the phase fluctuations of the BEC Nambu-Goldstone mode. The presence of the vortex yields an anomalous excitation spectrum with a finite energy gap and non-linear DOS at low energies. We find that the high sensitivity of the kelvon mode to external potentials provides a channel of quantum-level control over impurities trapped in a vortex. This extra control channel may be of practical use for the proposal of using vortex-trapped impurities as qubit units for quantum information processing.\nI. INTRODUCTION\nBose-Einstein condensates (BEC) host a variety of topological defects emerging collectively from the interactions among its constituent atoms. Notable examples are vortex configurations occurring in three-dimensional and in quasi-two-dimensional (quasi-2D) BECs. Their vorticity is quantized and the singularity in the phase of the BEC\u2019s order parameter causes the fluid to deplete with a long-range density profile [1]. Although a single-charge vortex is dynamically stable and topologically protected from dissipation [2], the system is bound up with multiple dynamics. For one, the vortex is intrinsically subject to the transversal excitations of its filament, known as kelvon modes; these can precipitate the vortex off its rotational axis, triggering an outwards precessional motion that eventually drives it to the boundary [3\u201311]. Once the vortex is removed then so is the phase singularity, and the BEC is left to evolve according to its intrinsic dynamics alone: the fluid undergoes quantum diffusion [12], driven by the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) mode inherent to the BEC state. One of our main results is to show how these two modes\u2014a kelvon and the NG mode\u2014have also an exceptional capacity to drive the dynamics of impurities embedded in the quantum fluid.\nThe physics of a BEC in the presence of impurities (e.g., heterogeneous atomic species) has aroused interest in both theory and experiment over the past decade [13\u2013 20]; of particular interest are cases when the BEC hosts one or multiple vortices, motivated by the possibility of impurities becoming bounded in their core or hopping across the Abrikosov lattice [21\u201324]. These systems naturally give rise to problems of quantum manybody physics, specifically, along the branch of polaron physics [25, 26]; spectral properties of such many-body systems are ubiquitously extracted via a variety of measures broadly referred to as densities of states\u2014energydistributions of excited states. We introduce and analyze a class of densities of states, which we call hydrodynamic, that naturally arise in this problem and which charac-\nterize the capacity of each excitation to interact with a given impurity. Moreover, we analyze the standard densities of states of Bogoliubov excitations to resolve their spectral structure. Remarkably, the latter point to the existence of anomalies in the excitation spectrum at small momenta, which are rooted in the long-range profile of the vortex.\nIn this work, we provide a detailed investigation of the low-lying spectrum of excitations of a quasi-2D BEC supporting a single-charge, on-axis vortex (vortex-BEC) by means of densities of states (DOS) and local densities states (LDOS) alike. The hydrodynamic LDOS, introduced here, follow from the leading-order coupling of an impurity to the excitations of a BEC. These measures show the exceptional sensitivity of an impurity to the remnant kelvon mode [27], a.k.a. the lowest corelocalized state (LCLS) [8], and to the Nambu-Goldstone mode of the spontaneous symmetry-breaking of the phase degree-of-freedom of a BEC. We show that the action of a pinning potential, which we include as the stabilization mechanism of the vortex [8, 28], affords a degree of quantum-level control over an impurity trapped in the core of the vortex by medium of the LCLS.\nThe paper is organized as follows: in Sec. II A, we review the Bogoliubov formalism applied to a vortex-BEC. We compute the relevant densities of states in Sec. II B, where we introduce the Bogoliubov and hydrodynamic DOS, followed by a description of the physical setup in Sec. II C. Numerical results are shown in Sec. III, where we highlight the spectral features of the vortex-BEC by comparison with the homogeneous, zero-vorticity case. Conclusion and discussion follow in Sec. IV."

Atomic annihilation and creation operators \u03a6\u0302 and \u03a6\u0302\u2020 satisfy the commutation relation [\u03a6\u0302(r), \u03a6\u0302\u2020(r\u2032)] = \u03b4(r \u2212 r\u2032)\nand N\u0302 = \u222b d2r \u03a6\u0302\u2020(r)\u03a6\u0302(r) is the number operator, whose\nexpectation value is fixed by the chemical potential \u00b5. The external potential V is comprised of two contributions: a highly anisotropic trapping potential Vtr, rendering the system quasi-2D; a small pinning potential Vp, introduced here to energetically stabilize the vortex. (These potentials are detailed in Sec. II C.)\nThe Bogoliubov approach suffices in the case of a weakly interacting BEC [29]. We thus decompose the field as(\n\u03a6\u0302(r)\n\u03a6\u0302\u2020(r)\n) = \u221a n0 ( \u03a60(r) \u03a60(r) ) + ( \u03c6\u0302(r) \u03c6\u0302\u2020(r) ) , (2)\nwhere \u03a60 is a BEC wave function (\u03a60 its complexconjugate), on top of which \u03c6\u0302(r) (\u03c6\u0302(r)\u2020) annihilates (creates) quantum excitations. Here, n0 = N0/A, with N0 the number of BEC atoms and A the area covered by the quasi-2D BEC cloud. The mean-field \u03a60 satisfies the time-independent Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) equation,\n( h\u2212 \u00b5+ n0g |\u03a60|2 ) \u03a60 = 0 , (3)\nwith h = \u2212(~2/2M)\u22072 + V , subject to the boundary condition consistent with the external potential V and to the normalization condition\u2329\nN\u0302 \u232a\n0 = n0\n\u222b d2r |\u03a60(r)|2 = N0 , (4)\nwhere \u3008. . . \u30090 represents the expected value in the manybody state of the BEC, which can be used to determine \u00b5.\nWe choose the natural microscopic units to be the coupling energy n0g and the coherence length \u03be = ~/ \u221a\n2Mn0g, so that quantities in the Hamiltonian (1)\nbecome rescaled as r 7\u2192 \u03ber, \u03a6\u0302 7\u2192 \u03be\u22121\u03a6\u0302, \u00b5 7\u2192 (n0g)\u00b5, h 7\u2192 (n0g)h and H\u0302 7\u2192 ( n0\u03be 2 )\n(n0g) H\u0302; substituting for (2) and by virtue of (3), we have\nH\u0302 = F0 + 1\nn0\u03be2 H\u0302B + . . . (5)\nwhere F0 = \u222b d2r\u03a60 ( h\u2212 \u00b5+ 1\n2 |\u03a60|2\n) \u03a60 is the (clas-\nsical) free energy of the BEC and\nH\u0302B = 1\n2\n\u222b d2r ( \u03c6\u0302\n\u03c6\u0302\u2020\n)\u2020 \u03c33HB ( \u03c6\u0302\n\u03c6\u0302\u2020\n) (6)\nwith the Bogoliubov operator\nHB = \u03c33\n( h\u2212 \u00b5+ 2 |\u03a60|2 \u03a620\n\u03a60 2\nh\u2212 \u00b5+ 2 |\u03a60|2\n) , (7)\nwhere \u03c3i (i = 1, 2, 3) denote Pauli matrices. Higherorder contributions of Eq. (5) are neglected within the Bogoliubov approximation. This requires \u2329 N\u0302 \u232a 0 \u2248 \u2329 N\u0302 \u232a , which holds provided kBT \u00b5 and n0\u03be2 1, i.e., in the limit of both weak thermal and quantum depletions. We then expand the excitation operators as(\n\u03c6\u0302(r)\n\u03c6\u0302\u2020(r)\n) = \u221e\u2211 \u03bb=0 ( X\u03bb(r)b\u0302\u03bb + \u03c31X\u03bb(r)b\u0302 \u2020 \u03bb ) , (8)\nin a complete basis of complex vector-valued functions X\u03bb(r) = (u\u03bb(r), v\u03bb(r)) T\n(X\u03bb its complex-conjugate), whose components u\u03bb and v\u03bb are the particle and hole components, respectively. By requiring that each b\u0302\u03bb and b\u0302\u2020\u03bb inherit bosonic commutation relations, the diagonalization of (6) becomes an eigenproblem for the X\u03bb as\nHBX\u03bb = \u03c9\u03bbX\u03bb . (9)\nBogoliubov operators HB are non-hermitian and, in general, admit complex eigenvalues [2]; the operator we study presently, however, possesses a fully real spectrum [5] and the bi-orthonormality relations\n\u3008X\u03bb, X\u03bb\u2032\u3009 = \u222b d2r X\u2020\u03bb\u03c33X\u03bb\u2032 = \u03b4\u03bb,\u03bb\u2032 , (10)\n\u2329 \u03c31X\u03bb, X\u03bb\u2032 \u232a = \u222b d2r ( \u03c31X\u03bb )\u2020 \u03c33X\u03bb\u2032 = 0 , (11)\nhold for every normalized eigenstate, where we introduce the bilinear product \u3008\u00b7, \u00b7\u3009; the diagonalized form of (6) thus reads\nH\u0302B = 1\n2 \u03b1P\u0302 2 + \u2211 \u03bb6=0 \u03c9\u03bbb\u0302 \u2020 \u03bbb\u0302\u03bb , (12)\nwhere the first term accounts for the dynamics of the phase degree-of-freedom of the BEC [12]. We explain the structure and importance of this term by observing that the variation of Eq. (4), i.e., \u03b4 \u2329 N\u0302 \u232a\n0 = \u03b4N0, yields\nthe condition \u222b d2r\nA ( \u03a60\u03980 + \u03a60\u03980 ) = 1 , (13)\nwhere we introduce the adjoint BEC wave function\n\u03980(r) = ( N0 \u2202\u00b5\n\u2202N0\n) d\u03a60 d\u00b5 (r) . (14)\n3 It is because Eq. (3) holds that \u03a60 and \u03980 comprise, respectively, the zero-mode ofHB (the Nambu-Goldstone mode of the BEC state [30]) and its adjoint, as\nHB (\n\u03a60 \u2212\u03a60\n) = 0 , HB ( \u03980 \u03980 ) = \u03b1 ( \u03a60 \u2212\u03a60 ) . (15)\nThe second of these equations is obtained by taking the derivative d/d\u00b5 of the first and then multiplying it by \u03b1, where we identify \u03b1 \u2261 N0(\u2202\u00b5/\u2202N0) [12]. These solutions make up the \u03bb = 0 mode in (8) as\nX0 = ( \u03980 + \u03a60,\u03980 \u2212 \u03a60 )T / \u221a\n2A, which is normalized, per Eq. (13), as \u3008X0, X0\u3009 = 1, thus determining \u03b1. The associated operators b\u03020 and b\u0302 \u2020 0 comprise the Hermitian operator P\u0302 = 1\u221a 2 (b\u03020 + b\u0302 \u2020 0) [31]. For conciseness, we refer to the mode X0 as the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) mode henceforth. The basis (8) thus becomes complete. (The zero-mode pertaining to the position of the vortex core, though related to the present discussion, is present only when the vortex is off-axis [32].)\nMaking the potential V be isotropic in the plane and assuming a vortex to be on the axis of a disk-shaped quasi-2D BEC, a vortex solution of the GP Eq. (3) can be written in polar coordinates as\n\u03a6\u03bd(r, \u03d5) = e i\u03bd\u03d5\u03c6\u03bd(r) , (16)\nwhere \u03bd is an integer, the quantized vorticity, and \u03c6\u03bd satisfies a reduced form of Eq. (3) in the radial coordinate [33]. Inserting (16) in Eq. (7), it becomes apparent that solutions of Eq. (9) can be separated, in polar coordinates, as\nX\u03bb(r, \u03d5) = e i\u03d5(m+\u03bd\u03c33)Xm,n(r) , (17)\nwhere m is an integer, the angular momentum of the excitation, and n, the number of nodes in the radial coordinate, is the quantum number associated to the non-zero eigenstates of the reduced Bogoliubov operator\n\u03c33Hm = ( h\u2212 \u00b5+ 2\u03c62\u03bd \u03c62\u03bd\n\u03c62\u03bd h\u2212 \u00b5+ 2\u03c62\u03bd\n) + 1\nr2 (m+ \u03bd\u03c33)\n2 ,\n(18)\nacting on Xm,n(r) = (\u03b1m,n(r), \u03b2m,n(r)) T . The label \u03bb 6= 0 is, thus, explicitly identified with the pair of quantum numbers (m,n) of solutions of the eigenproblem\nHmXm,n = \u03c9m,nXm,n . (19)\nNote that, by Eqs. (14) and (15), the NG mode has angular momentum m = 0."

            "text": "The local density of states (LDOS) of Bogoliubov excitations is typically defined in terms of the imaginary part of the associated Green\u2019s function [34]. In particular,\nwe can consider an angular momentum-resolved LDOS (AM-LDOS), given by\nD(B)m (r;\u03c9) = \u2211 n %(B)m,n(r)\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9m,n) , (20)\nwith the spatial density %(B)m,n given by\n%(B)m,n(r) = |um,n(r)| 2 \u2212 |vm,n(r)|2 . (21)\nHowever, a test particle of a different species (i.e., an atomic impurity) that interacts with the species comprising the BEC can be found to be sensitive to AM-LDOS of a distinct form:\nD(H)m (r;\u03c9) = \u2211 n %(H)m,n(r)\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9m,n) , (22)\nwith the spatial density %(H)m,n given by\n%(H)m,n(r) = \u2223\u2223\u03a60(r)um,n(r) + \u03a60(r)vm,n(r)\u2223\u22232 , (23)\nwhich is due, physically, to the interactions with the bosonic system being exclusively density interactions. The derivation of this AM-LDOS is illustrated in Appendix (A). We shall refer to the quantities in, and derived from, Eqs. (20) and (22) as the Bogoliubov and the hydrodynamic densities of states, respectively. We coin the latter hydrodynamic densities due to the %(H)m,n being identical to the density degree of freedom used in the hydrodynamic formalism for the excitations of a BEC [29].\nAssociated to the LDOS is the density of states of states (DOS), which provides a measure for counting excitations of a many-body system [29]. The angular momentum-resolved DOS (AM-DOS) are obtained by integrating in space each of the AM-LDOS, yielding\nD(O)m (\u03c9) = \u2211 n c(O)m,n\u03b4(\u03c9 \u2212 \u03c9m,n) , (24)\nwhere O = B,H, with weights c(B)m,n = 1 for the Bogoliubov densities of states, by virtue of Eq.

The (total) LDOS and DOS are recovered upon summing over all m, i.e.,\nD(O)(\u03c9) = \u2211 m D(O)m (\u03c9) (26)\nfor the DOS; as in Eq. (24), this is for O = B,H. For comparison with numerical results, we consider a large, homogeneous (i.e., vorticity zero and no boundary effects) quasi-2D BEC, in which case excitations have the\nBogoliubov spectrum \u03c9B(k) = \u221a k2 (2\u00b5+ k2), with k the mode\u2019s wave-vector, or momentum, and k = \u2016k\u2016.

Vortex nucleation and external potentials\nWe envision the on-axis vortex to be nucleated by phase imprinting via Laguerre-Gauss beams [35], that is, without imposing any laboratory-frame rotation on the fluid.\nWe consider the anisotropy of the trapping potential Vtr to be produced by a tight harmonic potential in the z-direction of energy ~\u03c9z \u00b5, yielding the effective interaction strength g = 2 \u221a 2\u03c0~2a/(Mlz), where a > 0 is\nthe s-wave scattering length and lz = \u221a ~/(M\u03c9z) is the characteristic length of the harmonic potential. The in-plane radial trap is a box potential of radius R \u03be, making Eq. (3) subject to the boundary condition \u03a60 (R, \u03d5) = 0. In natural units, the radius R = R\u03be is given by R = \u221a N/(\u03c0n0\u03be2), where n0\u03be 2 = lz/(4 \u221a\n2\u03c0a) is independent of the in-plane radial size (R is related to a dimensionless coupling strength introduced in Refs. [4] and [36]). For the pinning potential, we consider Vp(r) =\nexp ( \u2212r2/w2 ) , i.e., a Gaussian beam with maximum optical potential and waist length w [8, 37]; we shall refer to pinning configurations in terms of the ordered pair ( , w).\nFor the numerical calculations, we consider experiments with 7Li BECs [38] wherein positive values of a of tens of nanometers are accessible via Feshbach resonances, while typical trapping frequencies of hundreds of kiloHertz yield lz of hundreds of nanometers [39], resulting n0\u03be\n2 1 and, thus, guaranteeing a regime of negligible quantum depletion consistent with the Bogoliubov approximation. Moreover, in these conditions, a BEC of up to N \u2248 105 atoms may yield up to R \u2248 200, while experiments with box potentials up toR \u2248 70\u00b5m [40] yield, in laboratory units, n0g/~ \u2248 30kHz, or n0g/kB \u2248 200nK, and \u03be \u2248 300nm."

Notable features of the hydrodynamic DOS are reproduced here: the NG mode, at m = 0, and the LCLS, at m = \u22121, tower over all other low-lying states.\nThere is a visible growth of the hydrodynamic weight, Eq. (25) (the height of the peaks in each D(H)m ), with energy that ties in with the known breakdown of the hydrodynamic approximation beyond low energies [29]: it signals a departure from a collective sound-wave (phononic) picture of excitations, wherein the spectrum is \u223c k, to a single-particle (atomic) one, with the spectrum \u223c k2. The transition from the phononic to the atomic picture is accompanied by a decrease in the magnitude of the holecomponent v\u03bb relative to the particle-component u\u03bb of the excitation [29]. Thus, in this sense, the hydrodynamic weight c(H), Eq. (25), is a measure of the particle-hole imbalance of a bosonic state. We explain this observation by noting that the hydrodynamic spatial density % (H) \u03bb , Eq. (23), amounts to an interference pattern between the amplitudes of the particle and hole components u\u03bb and v\u03bb; this interference is essentially destructive, since \u03a60v\u03bb has only a phase ei\u03c0 relative to \u03a60u\u03bb. Thus, the discrepancy between the magnitudes of u\u03bb and v\u03bb determines the intensity of the interference pattern % (H) \u03bb and then c (H) \u03bb , being its integral, functions as a global measure of the particle-hole imbalance of the mode X\u03bb.\nWe note, moreover, that the presence of the vortex is known to lift the angular momentum-degenerate excitations of an otherwise homogeneous BEC [41], a feature that we highlight in Fig. 3.\n0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 1.0 (a)= 1\nFIG. 1.

This observation ensures that we will find a negligible effect for all low-energy modes except at angular momenta m = \u00b11; we have found the numerical evidence to support this observation, and so we focus our discussion on the case m = \u22121, for definiteness.

(Note that both terms are effects of the application of the pinning potential on the system, but that Vp is the direct effect while \u03b4BEC is an indirect effect on its modes, in particular.) We found that \u03b711 > 0 with 0.1 < \u03b711 < 20 and, for i = 0, 1, \u03b70i < 0 (negative due to the deformation term) with 10\u22122 < |\u03b70i| < 0.5, increasing with w in all cases\u2014that is, the term Vp dominates over \u03b4BEC for both \u220600 and \u220601 and vice-versa for \u220611.\nThis shows, since \u220600 \u220601 \u220611, that the LCLS is strongly dependent on the pinning potential directly, due to its exceptionally large amplitude at the vortex core; other modes are, at most, negligibly dependent on the pinning potential and indirectly so via the deformation of the BEC, as shown by \u220611.\nWe analyze the crossover of the c(H) by considering the probability of observing the pinning potential-free LCLS (i.e., the state X (0) 0 ) given a state Xn, that is, the over-\nlap |a0,n|2 = \u2223\u2223\u2329X(0)0 , Xn\u232a\u2223\u22232, plotted in Fig. 6. This figure of merit differentiates the states that possess a large, particle-like density at the vortex core for each configuration of the pinning potential. In particular, we can conclude that the LCLS (i.e., the mode with quantum numbers m = \u22121 and n = 0) eventually loses the characteristic hydrodynamic weight resulting from the large, core-localized density, as this becomes, due to the pinning potential, a feature of higher energy states. Hence the negligible magnitude of the % (O) LCLS seen in Fig. 1(c.2) relative to Fig. 1(b.2). Moreover, we notice that the crossover a0,0 with a0,1 is relatively steep while a0,1 with a0,2 is markedly smoother and can be seen to take place at a value |a0,2|2 < 0.5. This suggests that, as the intensity of the pinning potential increases (and with it the energy of a density at the vortex core), the large\n\u25e6\n\u25e6 \u25e6 \u25e6 \u25e6 \u25e6 \u25e6 \u25e6 \u25e6 \u25e6 \u25e6 \u25e6 \u25e6 \u25e6 \u25e6 \u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\u25e6\n500 1000 2000 0.5\n1\n2\n5 (b)\nFIG. 8. Log-log plots of (a) \u03c90,0, the energy of the first non-kelvonic excitation without a pinning potential, and (b) \u2206\u03c9, the mean inter-level spacing in energy between states above \u03c90,0, as functions of R; light blue circles are the numerical data and the darker blue lines are the linear fits performed in the scaling region used to obtain the exponents \u03b1 = 0.505 \u00b1 0.002 for \u03c9(0)0,0 and \u03b2 = 1.05 \u00b1 0.03 for \u2206\u03c9; the latter we obtained from a fixed sample including the first 250 states above \u03c90,0 and, in the fitting, we considered the standard error of the mean. Data breaks away from the scaling region at very large R plausibly due to numerical errors, as local features become too small for at the defined numerical precision. Gray lines in each panel are the corresponding quantity obtained from the homogeneous system used to derive Eqs. (27) and (28), whose energy levels are given explicitly in terms of the homogeneous spectrum by \u03c9m,n = \u03c9B(km,n), km,n = jm,n+1/R where jm,n+1 is the (n + 1)-th zero of the Bessel function Jm; deviations from the R \u22121 scaling are one order of magnitude below significant digits and covered by error margins.\nhydrodynamic weight characteristic of the LCLS (for a weak pinning potential) becomes spread out across a number of modes instead of concentrated in a single one, and, so, there will be a number of modes with increased hydrodynamic weights instead of a single dominant one. Thus, we can think of the large hydrodynamic weight,\n10\ninitially concentrated in the LCLS, as becoming diluted under a sufficiently intense pinning potential. This effect is shown in terms of the hydrodynamic AM-DOS in Fig. 7.\n2. Scaling and R-dependence\nWe carried out scaling analyses concerning the discrepancy between the gap (that is, the energy of the lowest non-kelvonic excitation \u03c90,0) and the mean inter-level spacing \u2206\u03c9, as apparent in the inset of Fig. 2(a). Thus, we obtained information on the appropriate low-energy, continuum description of density excitations; results are shown in Fig. 8. Indeed, we find distinct scalings between the energy of the first density excitation and the mean inter-level spacing, indicative of a gap that scales anomalously as O(R\u22121/2). For comparison, we show the prediction for a homogeneous BEC (given by the Bogoliubov spectrum \u03c9B) to scale as R\n\u22121; this gap is a trivial finite-size effect, as it scales equally to the mean inter-level spacing and approaches a massless spectrum. Notice that the deviation in the exponent of the mean inter-level spacing from that of the homogeneous spectrum, though small, is not accounted for by the error margin. Considering that the group velocity must vanish at the gap, this deviation is suggestive of a non-analytic, momentum-dependent correction to the linear dispersion.\nFinally, it shows in Fig. (6) that the energy level of the LCLS does not cross zero at the presented system size, that is, that it does not represent an energetic instability. Indeed, we have found that this mode stabilizes spontaneously for a system size R >\u223c 73, in qualitative agreement with Ref. [4]. (Eventual quantitative discrepancies are attributed to the fact that a quasi-2D BEC produced by a box potential is considered here.)"

            "text": "We have acquired new insights into the spectral properties of a quantum vortex in a quasi-2D BEC by analyzing the symplectic and hydrodynamic densities of states (DOS). Our discussion was particularly focused on two modes of the system. On the one hand, the lowest corelocalized state (LCLS), which is the remnant kelvon mode surviving the dimensionality reduction imposed by the trap. On the other, the Nambu-Goldstone (NG) mode inherent to the BEC state. Most strikingly, we have shown that these modes have an exceptional capacity to interact with impurities embedded in the BEC. Therefore, they can have a sizeable influence on the dynamics of these impurities, or, more generally, heterogeneous atomic species. Regarding the NG mode, we propose that this effect may be observable in the dynamics of degenerate fermion-BEC mixtures as well as heterogeneous BEC mixtures [42\u201345]. A proper account of the NG mode also becomes important to the polaron physics of the\nimpurity-BEC system, as impurities can become exceptionally sensitive to the phase fluctuations of the BEC. Physically, this effect is rooted in the particular way excitations interact with an impurity, of which strength results from an interference pattern between their particle and hole components.\nThe LCLS will greatly affect impurities trapped in the core of the vortex, due to its localized character. It can stimulate transitions between quantum states of the impurity, be them orbital states or internal degrees of freedom, by virtue of the LCLS being an eigenstate of angular momentum. In turn, the LCLS is highly sensitive to the action of a pinning potential (this is the physical fundament of that mechanism of vortex stabilization [8, 28]). It follows that the LCLS affords a novel mechanism of control over a vortex-trapped impurity at the quantum level: its energy can be tuned to a transition between two states of distinct angular momentum of the impurity, by means of the pinning potential, and stimulate the transition. As a matter of fact, there is no fundamental reason for this mechanism to be limited to the single-vortex configuration considered presently\u2014we can expect local properties of the excitations to hold in different physical setups. For instance, in the Abrikosov lattice of a quasi2D BEC, each vortex in the array is bound to possess a qualitatively similar remnant kelvon mode [46]. By allowing for such a degree of local, quantum-level control, this channel may be of practical use for a proposal based on vortex-trapped impurities as qubit units for quantum information processing [22, 47, 48].\nBased on the symplectic DOS, we have inferred anomalies in the spectrum of excitations, namely, that the excitations of a large (but finite) BEC hosting a vortex are slightly (but non-vanishingly) gapped. This is anomalous with respect to the typical Bogoliubov spectrum, which is gapless and linear. One implication of a gapped dispersion is that the group velocity must vanish at the gap. Our scaling analysis of the mean inter-level spacing is consistent with this condition: it presents a non-negligible deviation from linearity, suggesting a nonanalytic dependence in momentum. Physically, we attribute these results to the non-local, long-range profile of the vortex: its decays as \u223c 1/r2 results in the log(R)-divergent energy of the BEC and, notably, in a logarithmically-modified dispersion of its kelvons (in a three-dimensional BEC) [1]. To our knowledge, however, the theory to support the long-wavelength dispersion of the in-plane, non-kelvonic density excitations is yet to be established. This may be important to the quantum treatment of vortex dynamics in a quasi-2D BEC [49]."

            "text": "A box potential, such as considered in this work, endows the BEC wave function with a nearly-homogeneous\n12\nprofile, with the exception of an exponentially-fast depletion of the wave function at the border [51]. On the one hand, as the size of the BEC increases, it becomes numerically non-trivial to compute its full profile, seeing as the depletion becomes steeper and more abrupt at the scale of the system, as illustrated in Fig. 1(a); on the other hand, provided that any other non-homogeneous feature is sufficiently localized within the bulk, that is, away from the border of the BEC, the computation of its wave function and the computation of the wave function near the border can be asymptotically separated. We employ this observation to compute the solution of Eq. (29) by introducing an ansatz of the form\n\u03c6\u03bd(r) = \u03c6\u03a3(r)\u03c6\u2202\u03a3(r) ,\nwhere \u03c6\u03a3 is the wave function in the bulk surface of the quasi-2D BEC and \u03c6\u2202\u03a3 the wave function near the border.\nThe bulk wave function \u03c6\u03a3 is required to satisfy Eq. (29) in absence of Vtr\u2014that is, it is not required to satisfy the boundary condition \u03c6\u03bd(R) = 0, but rather\n\u03c6\u03a3(r \u2192 \u221e) = \u221a \u00b5 by the asymptotic separation argument. The solution can be obtained using imaginarytime evolution on a transformed radial coordinate \u03b8 = 2 arctan(r), with \u03b8 \u2208 [0, \u03c0); we did not update the chemical potential at each step of the evolution [52] but rather sampled the parametric \u00b5-dependence of the numerical solutions. Further, because Vp is exponentially localized at the origin, the asymptotic expansion \u03c6\u03a3(r) = \u221a \u00b5 ( 1\u2212 \u03bd 2\n2\u00b5r2\n) + . . . holds for large r [33].\nWe now solve for \u03c6\u2202\u03a3 using an asymptotic approximation. We begin by writing \u03c6\u2202\u03a3(r) = f(x), for i = 0, 1, 2, with the coordinate x = \u221a \u00b5/2(R\u2212r); the resulting equation reads\n\u22121 2 f \u2032\u2032 + ( 1\u221a 2\u00b5 1 R + x \u00b5R2 ) f \u2032+\n+ \u03bd2\n\u00b5R2 f \u2212\n[ 1\u2212 ( 1\u2212 \u03bd 2\n\u00b5R2\n) f2 ] f = O(R\u22123) , (B1)\nwhere we keep terms up to second order in R\u22121; likewise, we expand f asymptotically to order R\u22122:\nf(x) = f0(x) +R \u22121f1(x) +R \u22122f2(x) + . . . . (B2)\nConsidering x \u2208 [0,\u221e) by the asymptotic separation argument, we require the boundary condition f(0) = 0 and that f(x) be bounded as x \u2192 \u221e. To 0th order, the equation is \u22121\n2 f \u2032\u20320 \u2212\n( 1\u2212 f20 ) f0 = 0, with solution\nf0(x) = tanh(x), in agreement with Ref. [51]. The 1st and 2nd-order equations are not worthwhile displaying here; we mention only that we solved for the fi analytically with the aid of symbolic computation software; results are plotted in Fig. 9.\nThis method was validated against fully imaginary time-evolved solutions for small system sizes (R < 70). Because R2 amounts to a dimensionless coupling strength [4], this approximation constitutes a strongcoupling approximation.
