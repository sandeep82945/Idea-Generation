There\nare some studies regarding the effects of CBT on patients with polycystic\novary syndrome (PCOS). However, there is still no report of a meta-analysis\nfor systematic assessment.\nObjectives: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of CBT in improving\nweight loss, anxiety, depression, life quality, compliance, and pregnancy\noutcomes in patients with PCOS.\nMethods: Studies regarding CBT related to PCOS in PubMed, Cochrane library,\nEmbase, ClinicalTrials.gov, CNKI, and WANFANG DATA were searched for up\nto 19 November 2020. A random-effects model was used to perform a meta-\nanalysis.\nResults: Eight trials regarding CBT compared with lifestyle modification and\nroutine treatments were included. No differences in depression (SMD \u20131.11;\n95% CI \u20132.28, 0.07; P > 0.05), body mass index (BMI) (SMD 0.88; 95%\nCI \u20130.94, 2.71; P > 0.05), or overall life quality (SMD 1.24; 95% CI \u20130.44, 2.92;\nP > 0.05) were evident between CBT and control groups; however, anxiety\n(SMD \u20131.12; 95% CI \u20132.1, \u20130.13; P<0.05) and quality of life in hirsutism (SMD\n0.92; 95% CI 0.48, 1.35; P<0.05) were significantly improved. For secondary\noutcomes, both patient compliance and pregnancy rate were improved, but\nno significant change in pregnancy loss rate was identified.\nConclusion: CBT exhibited obvious advantages in the alleviation of anxiety,\nimprovement of quality of life in hirsutism, and increase of compliance and\npregnancy rate in patients with PCOS. Larger and higher-quality randomized\ncontrolled trials are needed to clarify the role of CBT in PCOS.\nSystematic review registration: [https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/],\nidentifier [CRD42021225856].\nKEYWORDS\ncognitive behavioral therapy, polycystic ovary syndrome, anxiety, depression, quality of life\nFrontiers in Psychology 01 frontiersin.org"

            "text": "Polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine-metabolic disease, affecting up to 6\u201312% of women of reproductive age (March et al., 2010; Bozdag et al., 2016). The clinical features of PCOS include hyperandrogenism, abnormal anovulation, polycystic ovary morphology (as revealed by ultrasound), and insulin resistance among others. PCOS usually manifests as a multisystem disorder. Psychological comorbidities are very common in PCOS patients, especially in those suffering from obesity and/or infertility, which may worsen the patient\u2019s condition. A study based on data from the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women\u2019s Health (ALSWH) demonstrated that compared with controls, women with PCOS exhibited an increased risk of depression and anxiety (Damone et al., 2019). Symptoms of PCOS, including reproductive dysfunction, metabolic dysregulation, and poor mental health are cited as reasons for reduced quality of life and increased financial issues (Greenwood et al., 2018; Sanchez-Ferrer et al., 2020). International evidence-based guidelines for PCOS recommend depression and anxiety screening for all women with PCOS and lifestyle modification as the first line of treatment (Teede et al., 2018). To improve patient\u2019s quality of life, the management of depression and anxiety is essential.\nCognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is a type of psychotherapy that modifies cognitive patterns and provides behavioral restructuring to alter psychological symptoms and behaviors. CBT has been successful in the treatment of various illnesses including obesity, depression, anxiety, eating disorders, insomnia, and other chronic disorders (Grilo et al., 2011; Reavell et al., 2018; Zweerde et al., 2019). CBT is recommended by the American Psychological Association and the American College of Physicians as the first-line treatment for depression (Qaseem et al., 2016). International evidence-based guidelines for PCOS also recommend CBT to help patients adhere to and maintain healthy lifestyles and improve health outcomes (Teede et al., 2018). There have been several studies on the effects of CBT on depression, anxiety, quality of life, pregnancy, pregnancy loss, and compliance in women with PCOS. However, to our knowledge, no meta-analysis has been performed regarding these analyses. The primary aim of this study was to conduct a meta-analysis to explore the effects of CBT on depression, anxiety, and quality of life in women with PCOS."

Moreover, there was insufficient evidence to demonstrate the effectiveness of CBT in reducing the pregnancy loss rate.\nCompared with non-PCOS women, women with PCOS are at a higher risk of obesity. Furthermore, obesity is associated with a risk of depression and anxiety (Lindberg et al., 2020; Tyrer et al., 2020). Anxiety, depression, and obesity can interact in those PCOS, resulting in a serious reduction in quality of life. Early intervention, aiming to\nFrontiers in Psychology 06 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 5 Meta-analysis of compliance rate.\nFIGURE 6 Meta-analysis of pregnancy rate.\nbreak the cycle of psychological comorbidities and obesity, exhibit the potential to improve quality of life dramatically and substantially reduce future complications. Psychological comorbidities are a major priority to be addressed in research and clinical domains, with a focus on improving the quality of life of patients with PCOS. Several meta-analyses have revealed that CBT has significant effects on alleviating patient anxiety and related disorders and improving the quality of life of patients with anxiety disorders (Hofmann et al., 2014; Carpenter et al., 2018; James et al., 2020). In line with these studies, our analysis identified that CBT could ameliorate anxiety symptoms in PCOS patients. In those with PCOS, quality of life is increasingly emphasized as an essential patient-reported outcome and can include physical, social, and emotional aspects.\nBazarganipour et al. (2015) performed a systematic review focusing on the effects of PCOS on specific aspects of quality of life; it was identified that quality of life was impaired most significantly in hirsutism and menstruation aspects in PCOS. Our study identified solid evidence to the tone that CBT has positive effects on the quality of life in PCOS patients. Great improvements in the hirsutism aspects of quality of life were demonstrated in the present meta-analysis. The effects that CBT has on the quality of life might be constrained mainly to the above aspects, but there is no clear conclusion thus far.\nA meta-analysis targeting multiethnic and minority obese adults reported that lifestyle modification based on multicomponent programs resulted in reasonable weight loss\nFrontiers in Psychology 07 frontiersin.org\nFIGURE 7 Meta-analysis of pregnancy loss rate.\n(Seo and Sa, 2008). However, in our study, we observed no significant effect of CBT on weight loss in patients with PCOS. It is considered that CBT should aid patient participation in lifestyle improvement via support and insistence. DuRant et al. (2009) suggested that the theories of CBT combined with behavioral science could be utilized in a combined manner to overcome the barriers to adapting to a healthy lifestyle. Moreover, we identified one study of non-controlled prospective cohorts that indicated a positive effect when CBT was provided during an intensive lifestyle modification in PCOS with multiple comorbidities such as obesity and depression (Rofey et al., 2009). It was reported that obese individuals with depression achieved weight reduction and symptoms of depression and CVD risk factors were ameliorated (Faulconbridge et al., 2011). However, there was not enough evidence identified in our literature review to support whether effects on weight loss and quality of life could be further optimized by combined CBT and lifestyle interventions in PCOS. Additionally, compliance and dropout in a lifestyle intervention for overweight and obese individuals are noticeable problems that cannot be overlooked. Regarding lifestyle intervention for overweight and obese infertile women, a meta-analysis reported the dropout rate as being up to 24% (Mutsaerts et al., 2013). As expected, the present meta-analysis revealed that compliance levels in PCOS patients could be improved by CBT treatment. CBT is based on three main principles including the teaching of skills, perception alteration, and cognitive reframing to aid patients and improve their ability to control psychological aspects of their disease and induce positive adaptive changes for the effective self-management of symptoms (Dryden, 2005). The economic value of the CBT depends on how its improvements on depression, anxiety, quality of life, compliance, and dropout confer additional health benefits. As PCOS is a chronic disease that requires lifestyle modification, CBT is an ideal therapy to be utilized\nto control disease effectively and reduce treatment dropout rate. The fundamental proposition of CBT is that cognitive activity, in addition to lifestyle modification or psychological counseling, affects behavior. It has been broadly accepted that desired behavioral changes may come about through cognitive change. As a routine psychosocial care, CBT provided by fertility staff or clinical psychologists could provide PCOS patients with information about lifestyle and behavioral changes that may negatively affect their general and reproductive health. Fertility staff or clinical psychologists should provide preparatory information regarding medical procedures that should promote compliance with medical treatments, as well as support patients in changing lifestyle behaviors.\nThis meta-analysis has numerous strengths. Several databases were searched without restrictions on language or timescales. One of the strengths of our study is that three common complications including obesity, depression, and anxiety in patients with PCOS have been studied simultaneously. Additionally, quality of life and pregnancy outcomes were also evaluated. However, there are also several limitations in the present study. The first is the small number of literature because studies that specifically address cognitive behavioral therapy for PCOS are few. The second is that several studies have low quality. Some studies lack a specific description of the dose of CBT and duration of treatment, and some studies lasted less than 6 months, while 6 months is usually necessary for a patient to exhibit behavioral change (Abdollahi et al., 2018; Cooney et al., 2018; Tang, 2020). CBT includes three-component intervention (nutrition, exercise, and CBT), which needs a professional counselor. The time-intensive nature of the implementation of CBT was also noticeable. It is possible that the brief descriptions of treatments provided may not fully reflect how the treatment is being delivered in practice. Finally,\nFrontiers in Psychology 08 frontiersin.org\nheterogeneity is an issue that cannot be ignored. There was substantial heterogeneity between study participants, outcome scales, CBT content, and delivery, which may influence the findings. Given the limited studies and sample size, we cannot conduct sub-analysis and sensitive analysis to explore the origin of the heterogeneity. In addition, a questionnaire of self-reported outcomes could result in bias in several studies.\nIn future, more well-designed clinical trials are needed to explore the effects of CBT when combined with lifestyle intervention in PCOS patients. Meanwhile, long follow-ups are required to observe the long-term effects of CBT in patients with PCOS."
