Impact of Public Health Interventions on Obesity and Diabetes Dynamics: Future research could focus on evaluating the effectiveness of various public health interventions aimed at reducing obesity and overweight prevalence, such as dietary guidelines, physical activity programs, and policy measures targeting food marketing. Using the mathematical model developed in this paper, simulations could be run to predict the impact of these interventions on the basic reproduction number and the disease equilibrium points. This research could also investigate the cost-effectiveness of different interventions, providing valuable insights for policymakers.

Incorporation of Genetic and Epigenetic Factors: While the current model accounts for genetic disorders in the context of diabetes, expanding it to include genetic and epigenetic factors that influence obesity could offer a more comprehensive view. This would involve integrating data on genetic predispositions to obesity and how lifestyle and environmental factors might modify these risks. Research in this area could lead to personalized intervention strategies that consider an individual's genetic makeup.

Modeling the Role of Microbiota in Obesity and Diabetes: Emerging research suggests a significant link between gut microbiota, obesity, and type 2 diabetes. Future studies could extend the current mathematical model to incorporate the role of gut microbiota in modulating obesity and diabetes risk. This could involve modeling the interaction between diet, microbiota composition, and metabolic health, and evaluating how interventions aimed at altering the microbiota (e.g., probiotics, prebiotics) impact obesity and diabetes prevalence.

Longitudinal Studies on Social and Environmental Determinants: The model highlights the influence of social pressure and environmental factors on obesity and diabetes. Future research could involve longitudinal studies to collect data on how changes in these determinants over time affect the incidence and prevalence of obesity and diabetes. This research could help in refining the model parameters related to social pressure and environmental changes, thereby improving the model's predictive accuracy.

Integration of Behavioral Economics into Obesity and Diabetes Modeling: Integrating principles of behavioral economics could enhance the model by providing insights into how individual decision-making affects dietary and physical activity behaviors. Future research could explore how nudges, incentives, and framing effects influence choices related to food consumption and physical activity, and how these behavioral interventions can be effectively incorporated into strategies to combat obesity and diabetes. This approach could lead to the development of more effective, behaviorally-informed public health campaigns and policies.
