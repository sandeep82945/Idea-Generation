    "abstractText": "The design of a green photocatalytic system that harnesses renewable and eco\u2010friendly constituents holds the potential to offer valuable insights into alternative strategies for treating toxic multi\u2010 components in refinery water effluents. A significant challenge in implementing a practical and viable approach is the utilization of solar energy\u2014an abundant, natural, and cost\u2010effective resource\u2014for photochemical processes within advanced oxidation processes. In this study, we explored the use of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) as photocatalyst prepared via an environmentally friendly synthesis approach, resulting in the formation of crystalline wurtzite nanoparticles, with an average size of about 14 nm relatively spherical in shape. Notably, the extract derived from Moringa oleifera was employed in this investigation. These nanoparticles were characterized and validated using various characterization techniques, including X\u2010ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X\u2010ray spectroscopy. For comparison, conventionally synthesized ZnO NPs were also included in the evaluations. The findings reveal that, under illumination, biosynthesized ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit photocatalytic performance in effectively breaking down the organic compounds present in synthetic petroleum wastewater. Photochemical analysis further illustrates the degradation efficiency of Green\u2010ZnO, which, within 180 min of irradiation resulted in 51%, 52%, 88%, and 93% of removal for Phenol, O\u2010Cresol. Under optimal loading conditions, NPs produced via the green synthesis approach perform better when compared to chemically synthesized ZnO. This significant improvement in photocatalytic activity underscores the potential of eco\u2010friendly synthesis methods in achieving enhanced water treatment efficiency.",

            "text": "The design of a green photocatalytic system that harnesses renewable and eco\u2011friendly constituents holds the potential to offer valuable insights into alternative strategies for treating toxic multi\u2011 components in refinery water effluents. A significant challenge in implementing a practical and viable approach is the utilization of solar energy\u2014an abundant, natural, and cost\u2011effective resource\u2014for photochemical processes within advanced oxidation processes. In this study, we explored the use of zinc oxide nanoparticles (ZnO NPs) as photocatalyst prepared via an environmentally friendly synthesis approach, resulting in the formation of crystalline wurtzite nanoparticles, with an average size of about 14 nm relatively spherical in shape. Notably, the extract derived from Moringa oleifera was employed in this investigation. These nanoparticles were characterized and validated using various characterization techniques, including X\u2011ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, field emission scanning electron microscopy, and energy dispersive X\u2011ray spectroscopy. For comparison, conventionally synthesized ZnO NPs were also included in the evaluations. The findings reveal that, under illumination, biosynthesized ZnO nanoparticles (NPs) exhibit photocatalytic performance in effectively breaking down the organic compounds present in synthetic petroleum wastewater. Photochemical analysis further illustrates the degradation efficiency of Green\u2011ZnO, which, within 180 min of irradiation resulted in 51%, 52%, 88%, and 93% of removal for Phenol, O\u2011Cresol. Under optimal loading conditions, NPs produced via the green synthesis approach perform better when compared to chemically synthesized ZnO. This significant improvement in photocatalytic activity underscores the potential of eco\u2011friendly synthesis methods in achieving enhanced water treatment efficiency.\nWater is an indispensable valuable resource used in a variety of industrial operations and is essential to all kinds of life. Environmental pollution caused by dangerous chemicals has recently become one of the biggest issues facing industrialized countries. One of the industries that produce\u00a0a lot of wastewater is the petroleum refining industry. Wastewater produced by the petroleum industries contains a variety of substances, mostly organic molecules (primarily aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons) and total solids dissolved (such as salts, barium, and\u00a0strontium).\nCrude oil includes considerable quantities of monoaromatic hydrocarbons including toluene, benzene, ethylbenzene, and xylene\u00a0(BTEX), which are categorized under volatile organic compounds (VOCs), and trace levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs)1. These toxic compounds find their way into the delicate ecological balance via the discharge of wastewater from petroleum industrial facilities, permeating the air, soil, and water, thereby exacerbating environmental pollution2. The ecosystem and living species are seriously\nOPEN\n1Center of Research on Microelectronics and Nanotechnology of Sousse, NANOMISENE Laboratory LR16CRMN01, Technopole of Sousse, B.P. 334, Sousse, Tunisia. 2Departament d\u2019Enginyeria Qu\u00edmica, Universitat Rovira i Virgili, Av.

To combat the environmental challenges posed by the release of toxic compounds from petroleum industrial plants, it is essential to promote the adoption of recycling and sustainable practices in the industry. These efforts not only contribute to environmental protection but also offer economic benefits and support long-term water resource preservation4.\nThis urgent concern has prompted a concerted effort to discover renewable technologies for water remediation with the following key tenets: increased efficiency and self-sufficiency. Petroleum refineries commonly employ primary and secondary wastewater treatment techniques. In the primary treatment phase, oil\u2013water separation is achieved through physical methods like sedimentation or dissolved air flotation. To tackle impurities, coagulation with chemicals like aluminum hydroxide or ferric hydroxide is utilized, forming sludge. Nevertheless, these technologies come with inherent drawbacks and constraints. Notably, they generate concentrated sludges necessitating further processing and discharge, which can impose financial constraints due to the substantial initial investments demanded5. In lieu of conventional treatment methods, Advanced Oxidation Processes (AOPs) offer a promising alternative for swiftly breaking down contaminants in aquatic environments. These innovative techniques involve the generation of hydroxyl radicals (OH.), among other reactive species, which can effectively interact with organic compounds and facilitate their complete mineralization6. Such processes include UV7; O3/H2O28; O3/UV7,8; photo-Fenton and Fenton processes4,9 and photo-catalysis4.\nAmong these techniques, solar photocatalysis is attracting considerable interest as a sustainable and environmentally friendly technology for petroleum refineries wastewater treatment owing to its ability to oxidize a wide range of organic pollutants.\nPresently, a variety of semiconductor-based nanophotocatalysts have been applied in water pollution remediation, with a significant emphasis on metal oxide nanoparticles10\u201312. Notably, zinc oxide (ZnO) has garnered considerable attention in this regard. ZnO stands out due to its outstanding charge transport properties, characterized by a 3.3\u00a0eV bandgap and a high excitation binding energy of 60\u00a0meV. Moreover, it exhibits excellent chemical stability, non-toxic nature and long-term photo-stability. These distinctive properties together produce an impressive photocatalytic behavior13.\nFundamentally, when a semiconductor boasting a suitably wide band gap absorbs light energy surpassing its own, it prompts the migration of valence band electrons (e\u2212) to the conduction band (CB), creating vacancies, or holes (h+), in the valence band (VB). These photo-excited electrons and holes subsequently initiate redox reactions with species whose redox potentials align appropriately. This interplay indeed induces reduction and oxidation reactions, giving rise to the production of superoxide (O2.) and hydroxyl (OH.) radicals, which play a pivotal role in breaking down the organic pollutant14,15.\nIndeed, the generated hydroxyl radicals, known for their strong oxidation properties, will initiate the breakdown of the contaminants adhered to the photocatalyst\u2019s surface, leading to the prompt formation of intermediate substances. These intermediates will ultimately transform into environmentally friendly compounds like carbon dioxide (CO2) and water (H2O), as indicated in (Eq.\u00a010).\nThus, the process of solar-induced photodegradation of toxic organic substances through redox reactions can be outlined in the following manner16,17:\nFour aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons often discovered in refinery effluent were designated as target pollutants to evaluate their removal effectiveness by solar-assisted photocatalysis, specifically, Phenol, O-Cresol, Toluene, and Xylene. Figure\u00a01 illustrates the redox reaction occurring during photocatalysis over ZnO NPs.\nSeveral methods for NPs synthesis are under consideration. They include both physical and chemical approaches, which, while effective, often entail high costs, time consuming, and environmentally toxic. The environmental compatibility is a significant advantage when it comes to applications involving water treatment, as it ensures that no harmful byproducts or residual toxicity are introduced during the remediation process. Indeed, in conventional processes, common reducing agents, such as sodium citrate, sodium borohydride, and various alcohols are widely known for their hazardous properties, their toxicity, flammability, explosiveness, and resistance to decomposition. Therefore, nowadays different researchers attempted to provide safer, non-toxic,\n(1)ZnO + h\u03c5 \u2192 ZnO (h+VB + e \u2212 CB)\n(2)H2O + h+VB \u2192 OH \u00b7 + H+\n(3)O2 + e\u2212CB \u2192 O \u2212\u00b7 2\n(4)O\u2212\u00b72 +H + \u2192 HO\u22122\n(5)HO\u22122 + H + \u2192 H2O2\n(6)H2O2 + h\u03c5 \u2192 2OH\u00b7\n(7)Harmful compounds that are in interactionwithOH.

One such innovative approach is the biological synthesis of NPs. In the process of green synthesis, a natural extract such as microorganisms and/or plant extracts is harnessed as an environmentally sustainable alternative reducing and capping agent. Consequently, the resulting NPs are devoid of any remnants of organic solvents or toxic chemicals, rendering them inherently eco-friendly when introduced into the environment. This approach offers a distinct advantage over conventional methods, due to its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, environmental friendliness, and relative reproducibility18\u201322.\nBased on several studies, green synthesis presents an alternative and promising approach to produce NPs that are safer, with reduced chemical toxicity, benefiting both human health and the environment23\u201326. Jayarambabu et\u00a0al. aimed to synthesize ZnO NPs using Lawsonia inermis leaf extract and explore their potential toxicological impacts. The histopathological assessment revealed the safe use of biosynthesized ZnO NPs, confirming their non-toxicity and compatibility with biological systems, thus indicating their promise in the treatment of various diseases. This study conclusively establishes the harmlessness of the biogenic production of ZnO NPs on all vital organs27. Moreover, early literature has shown that, compared to conventionally produced NPs, biosynthesized ZnO NPs significantly suppress both bacterial and fungal diseases28. Furthermore, a recent review lends support to the utilization of environmentally-friendly produced ZnO NPs as feed additives, highlighting their potential to enhance immunity against viral infections24. ZnO NPs derived from natural resources have received approval from the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA). They are classified as \u201cGRAS,\u201d which stands for \u201cGenerally Recognized As Safe.\u201d29. Rashidian et\u00a0al.23 conducted a study to assess the toxicological effects of green synthesized versus commercial ZnO NPs on the immune responses within the skin mucus of carp. The results of this investigation revealed that green ZnO NPs exhibited significantly reduced immunosuppressive effects on important components of fish skin mucus. These green NPs hold immense promise for a wide range of applications in the realms of biology, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. In the future, they have the potential to significantly enhance ecological protection and conservation efforts30,31.\nThis study presents a green synthesis approach for the production of ZnO photocatalysts, designed to support sustainable and environmentally friendly water remediation processes. This method involves the use of safer precursors, the elimination of hazardous compounds, the reduction of energy consumption and the utilization of renewable natural resources.\nThe added value of our strategy toward water remediation achievements is articulated in 3 aspects:\n\u2022 Eco-friendly photocatalyst fabrication process, with the addition of few or no chemical compounds during the synthesis, which imposes the respectful aspect to the environment when released into the ecosystem. \u2022 Sustainable and cost-effective nanotechnology. On the one hand it employs a green synthesis using readily accessible and cost-effective plant extracts. On the other hand, it utilizes photocatalysis through natural sunlight instead of artificial lighting, which not only has a shorter operational life but also demands a high energy input. This dual-pronged approach simplifies the process, reduces costs, and enhances scalability for widespread application. \u2022 Simultaneous degradation of organic compounds, present in refinery effluents (Phenol, O-Cresol, Toluene, Xylene).\nTherefore, in the present work, we highlight the utilization of M.

The\u00a0pore size distribution and porosities were obtained from the desorption isotherm branch by\u00a0using BJH approach, and\u00a0the specific surface area was acquired using the BET method.\nThe specific surface area of the biosynthesized and chemically produced ZnO NPs is 19.789 m2/g and 4.923 m2/g respectively. The creation of smaller particle sizes may be responsible for the increase in the surface area of green ZnO. Moreover, the pore volumes of Green ZnO and chemically synthesized ZnO are 0.149 cc/g and 0.020 cc/g, respectively. The quantity of ZnO active sites and surface area increase with increasing pore volume58,59, so increases the adsorption capacity, which therefore boosts the photocatalytic effectiveness.

            "text": "The surface charge of the semiconductor photocatalyst, the mechanism, and the rate of reactive oxygen species (ROS) formation are all significantly influenced by the solution\u2019s pH value61. This, in turn, affects the rate of photocatalytic degradation of contaminants62,63.\nThe point of Zero charge pH (pHpzc) of ZnO is 8 according to Fig.\u00a06 and in agreement with previous references64,65.\nIn this regard, the elimination of each pollutant on ZnO at four distinct pH conditions viz. 5, 7, 8, and 9 have been studied at a constant concentration of catalyst 0.25\u00a0g/L. (Fig.\u00a06). The C/Ci vs. time graph (where C denotes the concentration at various time intervals and Ci denotes the compound\u2019s starting concentration) using the biosynthesized ZnO NPs (Green-ZnO) under simulated solar irradiation is shown in Fig.\u00a07(a\u2013d).\nThe percentage of phenol destroyed is found to be very low in an acidic media. These observations can be related to the phenomenon having positively charged NPs\u00a0surfaces, which causes protonation of active sites and hence alters phenol adsorption, thereby affecting its removal66. Adsorption on ZnO will be less in the basic pH range, where phenol is predicted to be in the ionized state. As a result, surface-mediated degradation will be reduced67. Therefore, the neutral pH was the best suited for the phenol degradation.\nGiving the basic nature of o-cresol (pKa = 10.316), under acid media, it tends to be positively charged14,68. As it is shown, the photodegradation % rose marginally as the pH climbed from 5 to 7. Nevertheless, above the optimum pH 7, there was a decrement in photodegradation%.\nThe maximum degradation efficiency of Toluene and Xylene (88.30% and 93.13% respectively) was reached with pH 7 following 180 min in the simulated sunlight/ZnO system. Remarkably, the results were comparable at pH values 7 and 9.\nThe increased removal effectiveness at basic pH can indeed be attributed to the fact that, in alkaline pH, OH. are more readily formed via oxidation of\u00a0more hydroxyl radicals, that are present on the ZnO\u00a0surface, thereby boosting the process performance69,70.\n9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 0\n2\n4\n6\n8\n10\n12\n14\nFr eq\nue nc\ny (%\n)\nDiameter (nm)\nFigure\u00a05.

This behavior could be related to a possible aggregation of catalyst particles. Indeed, the zero surface charge creates zero electrostatic surface potential for pH levels near to pHzpc, which cannot generate the interaction rejection required to isolate the particles inside the solution. Aggregation occurs as a result, and photocatalyst clusters get bigger71.\nGreen vs chemically synthesized ZnO photocatalyst Figure\u00a08(a\u2013d) illustrates a comparison of time-dependent photocatalytic activity of both the Green-ZnO and the Chem-ZnO NPs towards each pollutant degradation. The photo-chemical analysis revealed that the degradation process with Green-ZnO within 180\u00a0min of irradiation resulted in 51%, 52%, 88%, and 93% of removal for Phenol, O-Cresol, Toluene, and Xylene respectively. However, in the case of Chem-ZnO, the percentage of degradation was 33%, 34%, 74%, and 89% of removal for Phenol, O-Cresol, Toluene, and Xylene respectively. The biosynthesis of ZnO clearly demonstrated a higher or quite equivalent\u00a0degradation effectiveness in comparison to ZnO synthesized with conventional chemical route.\nA similar trend has been documented in prior studies that investigated dye degradation, whether using environmentally friendly or chemical synthesis methods72,73. It is widely assumed that the morphology, surface, and crystallinity of material are mainly responsible for its photocatalytic activity74. Indeed, the plant extract\u2019s bioactive substances aid in the development of ZnO nuclei through capping but also stabilizing them. As a result, the green method produces NPs that have greater distribution, structure-tunable, and are\u00a0size-controlled75\u201377 compared to the chemically synthesized sample, which could provide stability, a larger specific surface area, and reduced particle sizes, thus, high photogenerated charge carrier separation capabilities, enhanced light absorption and finally better degradation of pollutant molecules.\nTables\u00a0S1, S2, and S3 in the Supplementary Information section offer a comparative analysis of our research findings with those from previous studies focusing on ZnO synthesized through various methods for the PC degradation of petroleum hydrocarbon contaminants. This comparison underscores the competitiveness of the results we have obtained in this study when compared to existing efficiency standards.\nThe primary objective of this research is to explore an environmentally sustainable, uncomplicated, and cost-effective solution that can either reduce the volume of waste discharged in effluents or promote the reuse of purified water, thus reducing the consumption of freshwater. The novel approach for photocatalyst synthesis employed in this study represents an initial step towards optimizing a more sustainable process, especially, when paired with sun energy, this allows an economically feasible route in the application of solar photocatalysis. Importantly, According to a previous study, the economical evaluation points out\u00a0that the highest loads for the cost composition are due to catalyst synthesis, corresponding to 95% in a solar photocatalysis system34.\nUltimately, working with photocatalysts in form of powder needs a post-processing removal of the NPs from the liquid solution which could be an inefficient additional process step especially from an industrial perspective. For this reason, the development of photocatalysts immobilized as coatings is thus an improvement. That will require modifying the substrate, using a different thickener, or introducing a linker between ZnO and the substrate. In this case, the stability parameter and a study of reusability would be significant. We consider that an interesting topic for our ongoing and future research.\n5 6 7 8 9 10\n-2\n-1\n0\n1\n2\n3\n\u2206H\npHi\nFigure\u00a06.
