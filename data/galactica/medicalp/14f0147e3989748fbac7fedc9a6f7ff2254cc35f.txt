ABSTRACT Introduction Wilson’s disease (WD) is a copper metabolism disorder characterised by a progressive accumulation of this metal mainly in the liver and the brain. Treatment is based on the removal of copper operated by the chelators, among which, Dpenicillamine (DP) is prescribed as a firstline treatment in most situations. There is some evidence in linking the use of DP with a risk of vitamin B 6; therefore, vitamin supplementation is sometimes recommended, although nonconsensually. The objective of our study was to evaluate the level of vitamin B 6 in WD patients treated with DP with and without associated supplementation. Methodology All WD patients followed at the National Reference Centre for WD in Lyon between January 2019 and December 2020 treated with DP for more than 1 year were included and separated in two groups according to vitamin B 6 supplementation. The level of vitamin B6 was measured by the determination of pyridoxal phosphate (PLP). Results A total of 37 patients were included. Average age of 23.3±14.8 years, 15 patients with <18 years. Median duration of treatment was 51 (55.8) months. 15 patients were under vitamin B 6 supplementation and 22 had interrupted it for more than 1 year. The median PLP level was significantly higher in the group with supplementation, 137.2 (86.7) nmol/L vs 64.9 (30.8) nmol/ (p<0.01). No patient had a PLP level<35 nmol/L. Conclusion Longterm stable WD patients under DP treatment probably do not need vitamin B 6 supplementation.
