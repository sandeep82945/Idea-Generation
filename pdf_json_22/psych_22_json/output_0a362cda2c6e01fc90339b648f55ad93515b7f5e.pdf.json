            "text": "Most people will experience bereavement during their lifetime. For many, the period following death can be disruptive and time is needed to adjust and accept the death of a loved one. Most individuals adapt to their loss and can integrate back into their life, often within a few months after the death [1]. However, a proportion of individuals experience prolonged, intense grieving that affects physical and mental health, and impacts on social and emotional wellbeing. This response is referred to as complicated grief [2]. Features may include guilt, anger, denial, emotional numbness or difficulty in engaging with activities [2]. Complicated grief is increasingly referred to as \u201cprolonged grief disorder\u201d and this term is now included in both the 11th edition of the International Classification of Diseases-11 and the 5th edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders [3].\nThe proportion of individuals who experience complicated grief following a bereavement\nhas been estimated to be between 5 and 10% in the general population [4]. In contrast, studies have shown that there is a much higher prevalence in family members bereaved in intensive care unit (ICU) settings, with studies estimating a prevalence of 46%-52% [5, 6]. Risk factors for complicated grief have been identified in non-ICU settings, which have led to the development of bereavement risk assessment screening tools for hospice and community settings [7]. However, given the highly technical environment and the frequency of sudden deaths in ICU compared to the wider hospital or community settings, it is possible that individual factors which are specific to the ICU context have not been considered in previous work. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the unique challenges of supporting family members during and after end-of-life care in ICUs [8, 9].\nSeveral reviews have been conducted previously to evaluate risk factors for complicated\ngrief in the general population [10, 11], and specifically in family caregivers [12, 13]. However, there are no published systematic reviews specifically investigating risk factors for complicated grief in the ICU context. Therefore, we aimed to systematically review published studies investigating factors associated with complicated grief among family members of patients dying in ICU (ICU decedents)."

The result of interest was the association between potential risk factors and complicated grief. Where possible odds ratios, risk ratios or hazard ratios were extracted for both univariable and multivariable analyses along with the relevant 95% confidence intervals. If this was not available, another relevant measure of association was extracted with its corresponding p-value. Data were extracted for all time points where results were reported.\nQuality assessment, risk of bias and data synthesis\nThe Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) [16] was used to assess the risk of bias for observational studies. It was conducted independently by two reviewers, with the results synthesised together by a third reviewer. Any disagreements were resolved using the third reviewer. Results were tabulated and a narrative synthesis was conducted due to great variability in the risk factors assessed and measures of association, thus precluding a meta-analysis."

Almost all studies were observational in nature, apart from one interventional study [18]. Most relatives included were children or a spouse/partner of the patient. The Inventory of Complicated Grief (ICG) or ICG-Revised was used in six studies and the Core Bereavement Items questionnaire for one [17]. The ICG is a 19-item questionnaire with first-person statements scored using a Likert\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0264971 March 10, 2022 3 / 17\nscale.

The Core Bereavement Items questionnaire consists of 17 questions measuring the intensity of bereavement reactions by assessing \u2018core\u2019 bereavement experiences [24].\nA total of 61 different risk factors were investigated across all the studies.

Many of the other factors were associated with an increased risk during univariable analyses but not in multivariable analyses. There was some evidence suggesting not having the opportunity to say goodbye and being present at the time of death was associated with an increased risk.\nOther variables related to health and social needs. One study measured the concordance\nbetween three health-related questionnaires, measuring depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and social distress and risk of complicated grief. This demonstrated a slight concordance with complicated grief [25], based on the kappa statistic. A previous history of depression (p = 0.09) or use of psychotropic medications (p = 0.74) appeared to have no bearing on the risk for an individual [21].\nCoping mechanisms/determinants.

In addition, they avoided the potential burdens associated with end-of-life care decision-making when patient wishes were uncertain. In contrast, family members experienced increased risk of complicated grief when a patient died while intubated and receiving mechanical ventilation or if receiving circulatory support with vasopressor therapy. These factors could reflect the impact on family members of the challenges in \u201cnegotiating a natural death\u201d in patients receiving invasive life support therapies in a highly technical ICU setting [26]. However, in some cases they may signify family requests for escalating life support therapies when clinicians counsel comfort care, and therefore act as a marker for conflict between family members and clinicians or for family difficulties in accepting death [27].\nCommunication was another important identified factor. Communication between the\npatient and family member prior to death has been assessed previously [10, 13, 28], but not communication with the medical staff in the context of bereavement outcomes. Sensitive and effective communication may be even more important in the ICU due to the distressing nature of the circumstances and environment. Problematic communication may make it harder for family members to understand what has happened and thus lead to difficulties during the grieving process. A previous study asking family members to make recommendations for improving end-of-life care identified communication as one of the key issues [29]. The global COVID-19 pandemic has amplified these factors and highlighted their importance [30].\nFamilies who did not have the opportunity to say goodbye to their loved one had increased\nrisk of complicated grief. However, being present at the time of death also increased the risk of complicated grief. This apparent paradox may be explained by the fact that these two factors describe different aspects of end of life care. Withdrawal of life sustaining therapies can lead to clinical signs or respiratory distress, which, if not adequately managed, families might find distressing if present at the time of death [31].

Several risk factors were identified repeatedly, increasing the strength of the evidence-base. For example, being the decedent\u2019s spouse has been associated consistently with increased likelihood of complicated grief [10\u201313, 36, 37] and some studies also found parents of the decedent were at an increased risk [11, 13, 36]. Studies identified highly dependent relationships another risk factor [10, 11]. This review identified being a spouse as a risk factor in ICU decedent populations but without details of the spousal relationship. Consistent with previous reviews, we identified younger age of the deceased [10\u201312] and lack of preparedness for death as being risk factors for complicated grief [10, 12, 13].\nA number of factors from previous reviews were non-significant or inconclusive in this\nreview: female relative [10, 11], low income [11], prior psychiatric illness [10\u201312], violent death [10, 11] and lack of education [11, 12]. This may be because some of these factors were not investigated in specific studies, the small sample size in most studies, or because these factors are of less relative important in the context of the ICU setting.\nThere are several strengths to this review. Firstly, we searched multiple databases to help\nidentify as many relevant studies as possible. Duplicate screening for study inclusion and quality appraisal aimed to reduce error and bias. In addition, we scrutinised studies to identify those which reported factors associated with complicated grief in secondary analyses, despite the primary aim and study design being unrelated, for example in a randomised controlled trial of a condolence letter [18].\nThis review had a number of limitations. Studies were restricted to those published in\nEnglish, potentially leading to eligible studies being missed. Many of the studies has small sample sizes increasing the risk of erroneously reporting no effect due to type II error. Additionally, due to the lack of studies investigating the same risk factors, it was not possible to conduct a meta-analysis.\nSimilar numbers of deaths occur in critical care and inpatient hospice settings in the UK\n[38]. Despite the high prevalence of complicated grief and mental illness experienced by families of ICU decedents, pro-active screening and bereavement support are uncommon in ICU settings [39]. Specialist palliative care involvement is and the impact of this on care around death in ICU is unclear. This is in contrast to hospice settings, in which bereavement care is an integral component of holistic care provided to patients and families, before, during and after death. Our findings highlight the need to develop and tailor bereavement follow-up services and screening for risk of complicated grief in the ICU context. Implementing such an approach brings its own challenges. Family member-specific demographics and characteristics are not included routinely in ICU clinical records. Specific risk factors related to perceived quality of communication, conflict and emotional burden may emerge during care but can be difficult to elicit reliably as part of routine care. Despite these challenges, possible models of ICU bereavement support services have been reported [40, 41]. ICU services can learn from other services such as hospices that have already integrated bereavement follow-up care pathways into standard practice, and implement similar models to ensure that families bereaved in ICU are provided with the support that they require. The COVID-19 pandemic with its high ICU death rates has been a catalyst for better palliative care and ICU integration in some areas, with proactive palliative care reviews in ICUs becoming routine [42].\nOur review identified risk factors for that are modifiable within the ICU. Improving communication between clinicians and family members, involving families in end-of-life discussions and facilitating opportunities to say goodbye may be targets for interventions [6]. Similarly, patient involvement in decision-making about treatment escalation was associated with a markedly reduced risk of family members developing complicated grief. Whilst this is often impossible at the time of ICU admission due to impaired decision-making capacity,\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0264971 March 10, 2022 13 / 17\nearly engagement in advance (anticipatory) care planning with patients and families before a health crisis may have a positive impact on family members, particularly if it helps prepare them for proxy decision-making. Some of these factors have been the subject of clinical trials, with mixed results [43, 44]."

Our findings highlight the need to develop and tailor bereavement screening and follow-up services for family members bereaved in ICU settings."
