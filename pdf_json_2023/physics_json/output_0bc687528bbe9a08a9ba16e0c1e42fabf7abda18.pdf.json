            "text": "Doxorubicin (DRB, Fig.\u00a01a) is an anticancer drug generated by the Streptomyces peucetius var. caesius. Fungus. It is frequently utilized in chemotherapy treatment for various cancers, including leukemia, Ewing\u2019s sarcoma, Hodgkin\u2019s disease, testicular, Kaposi\u2019s sarcoma, several forms of carcinoma, breast, and tissue sarcomas [1].\n*Correspondence: Ahmed Abdulhafez Hamad ahmedabdelhafez@azhar.edu.eg 1Department of Pharmaceutical Analytical Chemistry, Faculty of Pharmacy, Al-Azhar University, Assiut Branch, Assiut 71524, Egypt\nKeywords Optical density, Taxol, Doxorubicin, Paclitaxel, Degradation behavior, Eco-rating\nlimited in cancer treatment. Paclitaxel (PTX, Fig.\u00a01b) is a diterpenoid isolated from Taxus brevifolia bark. [7]. It is a mitotic inhibitor used in cancer chemotherapy to cure various cancers, like ovarian, breast, lung, cervical, and pancreatic cancer. Taxanes work by reversibly binding to tubulin to anchor microtubule complexes and stimulate microtubule polymerization. One of the most effective drug combinations for treating solid tumors involves anthracyclines and taxanes. Paclitaxel and doxorubicin are the most concurrently administered among these. The two pharmacological action mechanisms produce synergy when the two classes are coupled. The paclitaxel/ doxorubicin combination appears as a good and efficient strategy in the first-line management of many solid cancers. Additionally, for individuals with incurable malignancies, systemic combination chemotherapy is the final option [8]. Monitoring DRB levels is crucial due to the relative above [9, 10]. Since DRB cytotoxic antibiotics are required for both chemical and clinical testing, it is necessary to quantify their concentration. Various methods were reported for evaluating DRB in raw or medicinal formulations. For instance, one way that has been described is a chromatographic strategy either using the UV-VIS detector [11, 12] or the fluorescence detector [13, 14]. In addition, other techniques were reported such as chemiluminescence [15, 16], electroanalytical techniques [17, 18], electrophoretic methods [19, 20], immunoassay [21, 22], and nanoparticle design systems [23, 24]. Conversely, a few spectroscopic-based methods were discovered in the literature, including Raman scattering [25\u201327] and spectrophotometric methods [28\u201330].\nAdditionally, it is imperative to emphasize that HPLC systems require substantial amounts of high-purity organic solvents, multiple steps for preconditioning sample procedures, and costly apparatus and detectors. Furthermore, the decreased sensitivity of the previously documented spectrophotometric methodologies, as well as the tedious and complicated procedures that necessitated heating, extraction, and the use of more complex materials [31, 32], were obvious limitations. Therefore, it is crucial to create a spectrophotometric method that is green, direct, fast, simple, and sensitive for the analysis of the antineoplastic medication doxorubicin. The\naforementioned objectives may be attained through the utilization of the spectrophotometric methodology, coupled with the inherent self-absorption properties of the investigated medication in an acidic ethanolic setting.\nThe suggested approach was thoroughly tested based on ICH criteria [33] (Quality Guidelines) and was successfully applied to promptly detect DRB in raw powder, medications, and human bodily samples. Only a few spectrophotometric [28\u201330] approaches for quantifying DRB in crude powder and marketable pharmaceutical preparations have been reported, and no colorimetric stability studies have been published.\nFurthermore, there are no spectrophotometric methods for determining DRB, an anthracycline radical in the presence of a taxane, paclitaxel drug in bulk, vial, or other matrices. Therefore, it is essential to develop quick, sensitive, precise, and simple spectroscopic methodologies for determining DRB oncogenic agents. In conclusion, creating an accessible, trustworthy, fast, and highly delicate logical technique for estimating DRB was critical. The preceding target could potentially be achieved through the utilization of a spectrophotometric methodology, which boosts the intrinsic absorbing capacity of DRB by examining the impact of various diffusion media. The present study aimed to develop and authenticate an eco-friendly spectrophotometric method that is both selective and sensitive, while also being straightforward and expeditious, for the purpose of quantifying DRB. There is no longer a toxic organic solvent involved in the suggested analytical strategy.\nWithout impact from the sampling process or co-formulating ingredients, the current method was designed and validated in accordance with ICH requirements [34] to rapidly test DRB in unprocessed powder and prescription medications with exceptional accuracy and precision. The suggested approach was extended to further investigate DRB\u2019s intrinsic stability under difficult environments, such as protogenic, oxidizing, and photolytic (UV, daytime, and direct sunlight)."

Nevertheless, these methodologies exhibit the drawback of necessitating costly solvents and apparatus. Consequently, the development of an environmentally friendly, cost-effective, sensitive, and facile procedure for detecting DRB in untreated powder and vials was considered necessary. The investigation employed spectrophotometry due to its advantageous features, including simplicity, selectivity, suitable sensitivity, and accessibility in most quality control laboratories. DRB was given a dark orange coloring because of its chemical structure, which includes the core of a conjugated anthracycline skeleton. Yet, in a solution containing water, its color is relatively weak. The utilization of different diluent and micellar media as drug matrices has emerged as a prominent approach to enhance the inherent absorbance and emission of several molecules. This technique has the potential to enhance sensitivity and consequently reduce the detection limit. The planned study utilized organic solvents that are low in hazard and safe for use, which have been observed to be associated with higher quantum yield [40]. The observed response augmentation could potentially be attributed to the stability or conservation of the stimulated singlet state [41]. Also, this increase in the micellar medium could be because unrestricted rotational motions are limited, which decreases the absorption or fluorescence [42]. Analogously, the aforementioned enhancement was observed in the absorption response relative to the enhancement observed while employing an organic liquid [39]. By employing this method, the spectrophotometric measurement of the suggested drug was greatly enhanced. Figure\u00a0 2 illustrates the limited water absorption characteristics of DRB [43]. The spectroscopic properties of DRB were investigated using a number of organic solvents and surfactant-spiked media. The\nutilization of ethanol as an endogenous medium resulted in the most significant advancements in the fluorescence strength [39] and molecular absorptivity [43] of DRB in comparison to an aqueous solution. Consequently, ethanol was selected as an absorbance promoter to develop a novel spectrophotometric method for evaluating the referenced medication. The absorbance spectrum of DRB and PTX is depicted in Fig.\u00a02a and b."

Among these were the surfactants SDS (anionic), CTAB (cationic), PEG 6000 (non-ionic), Tween-80 (anionic), CMC\u2212 Na+ (anionic polysaccharide), and other macromolecules like PVP and cyclodextrin. Using non-ionic surfactants, such as PVP and PEG 6000, does not influence the method\u2019s absorption. On the other hand, CMC Na and CD; macromolecules have the same effect on the drug\u2019s absorption. It turns out that the non-ionic surfactant, the anionic surfactant, and the cationic one all had a more considerable effect on the absorbance of the drug than water did (Fig.\u00a0 4). The process of micellization has been observed to suffer from a delay in the presence of organic solvents. This phenomenon can be attributed to the complex relations between the hydrophobic interactions of long-chain hydrocarbon tails and the repulsive interactions of ionic head groups. Additionally, the influence of organic solvents on the aforementioned interactions further contributes to the observed delay [44].\nThe process of surfactant monomer aggregation occurs when the energy from the ionic head groups overcomes the attraction between their hydrocarbon part, thereby\nenabling the formation of a larger molecule. The static dielectric constant (\u03b5) at 298.15\u00a0K for various substances such as dioxane, DMF, Ethylene Glycol, and DMSO, has been reported to be: 2.2, 38.3, 41.4, 46.7, and 80, respectively [45]. Given that the procedure involves adding more organic solvent, the repulsion between ionic groups is reduced, which lowers the response value measured in the mixed media. Because of this, micelle production in organic solvent/water; mixed settings may be slowed down. The transfer of hydrocarbon tails, methylene groups in the spacer, and methyl groups in the head part of surfactants to the micellar surface or interior becomes less thermodynamically favorable as the concentration of organic solvent increases in mixed organic solvent/ water media. Rodr\u00edguez et al. reported that comparable outcomes were achieved through micellization of the 12-3-12 Gemini surfactant in diverse mixed solutions of water and organic solvents [46]. While surfactant CMC values increase in all solvent/water mixed media, they are\nsignificantly reduced when the percentage of organic solvent is increased to 10.0 [47]."

A substantial increase in the molar absorption of DRB was observed when the organized medium and water were substituted with organic solvents. Ethanol was the most intense intrinsic absorbance, followed by methanol and DMF, with water having the lowest absorbance amplitude of all the studied solvents. It can be seen from the response data that the strength was inversely adequate to the polarity of the solvent utilized; and this is in agreement with the corresponding dielectric constants values of the investigated solvents, which were 46.7, 37.5, 36.7, 32.7, and 24.5 [48, 49]. The previous explanation matched with earlier published study of a similar design [39].\nThere are numerous ketonic and hydroxyl moieties in DRB. These groups tend to form hydrogen bonds with ethanol molecules, decreasing the non-radiative deactivation of an excited state by reducing the molecule\u2019s intra-molecular dynamic, and increasing absorbance. In our study, we used ethanol as the sensitizing solvent because it enhanced absorbance more than any other solvent or medium (Fig.\u00a04).\npH and volume impact An investigation of DRB molar absorption in the employed medium was conducted. Experiments with hydrochloric acid (pH 1.0\u20132.0) and Britton-Robinson buffer solutions (pH 2.0\u201310.0) revealed that DRB\u2019s intrinsic absorbance was pH-dependent.
