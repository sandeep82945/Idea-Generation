    "abstractText": "Resilient prescribing is an approach to the use of psychotropics that considers the significance of the treatment beyond the direct effects of the medication. Within this strengths-based approach, those who are prescribed medications must retain a sense of self-efficacy, understand the importance of their own actions in their recovery, have reasonable expectations of what a medication can and cannot do, and avoid the adoption of a disempowering illness identity. These constitute the principles of resilient prescribing. In this manuscript, we explore these principles with consideration for how they may be applied in deployed settings where the ability of service members to recover from behavioral health concerns is mission critical. These principles offer a roadmap to prescribing that builds upon the service members\u2019 own strengths and has the potential to amplify the positive impacts of mental health treatment. INTRODUCTION The prescription of psychiatric medication carries significance beyond the specific dose and choice of agent. The work of Mintz1\u20133 and others4 highlights the importance of patient and provider characteristics, as well as psychodynamic factors and the placebo phenomena in impacting the medication experience, particularly in antidepressants. More recently, approaches to prescribing that capitalize on this perspective have been presented,5 and a clinical treatment philosophy has been implemented in which the task of prescribing (as well as therapy) is centered on the goal of promoting recovery by fostering resilience.6 An approach to prescribing which considers the impact of the treatment beyond the specific effects of the drug is of value in settings where behavioral components of recovery are thought to be essential. It is critical that individuals who are prescribed medications retain a sense of self-efficacy, *Intermountain Healthcare, Ogden, UT 84403, USA \u2020Shaping Your Future Psychiatry, Virginia Beach, VA 23464, USA \u2021384th Wellness Clinic NCOIC, Camp Arifjan, 09330, Kuwait \u00a7Department of Psychiatry, John A.

Furthermore, maintaining resilience in the the process of recovery from mental health difficulty is necessary for service members being able to function and remain in deployed environments. In this manuscript, we detail an approach to resilient prescribing, drawing on existing theory, lessons learned in civilian settings, and the recent experience of applying these principles within a deployed environment (384th Combat Operational Stress Control, Kuwait, 2022). The kinetic environment within a combat operational stress control unit is characterized by a high turnover rate of prescribers, a limited medication formulary, and the need for service members to maintain a high operational tempo even in the face of behavioral health or combat stress difficulties. The practical guidance here should equip other mental health providers to enhance their practice by considering how the act of prescribing may impact psychosocial aspects of recovery and how certain deliberate actions may work to foster, rather than undermine the resilience of service members seeking mental health treatment. 236 MILITARY MEDICINE, Vol. 188, September/October 2023 D ow naded rom http/academ ic.p.com /m ilm ed/article/-10/236/7110830 by Idian Intitute of Tenology Ptna user on 09 Jauary 2024 Resilient Prescribing PRINCIPLE 1: SITUATE MEDICATION WITHIN A BIOPSYCHOSOCIAL FRAMEWORK In the absence of extensive training in mental health, service members cannot be expected to have a comprehensive understanding of how medications may support recovery. In fact, service members may react to the initiation of medication with a sense of personal failure or loss of control.8 It is therefore critical that the provider achieves the dual goals of (1) destigmatizing psychiatric disorders and (2) educating service members that these illnesses result from factors in our brains, our personalities, and our environments, and addressing each component is necessary for a real recovery. Here, the metaphor of a \u201cgood running shoe\u201d may serve as superior to misleading adage of \u201ccorrecting a chemical imbalance\u201d: Think of your medication like a really good pair of running shoes. And think of your recovery like being able to run a marathon. Having a pair of shoes makes things a lot easier. But you still need to put them on, get outside, and push yourself to get moving. There is value in framing this psychoeducation in a strengthsbased manner, letting the service member know that the best tools they have for supporting their recovery involve accessing the strengths that they had before even starting medication. Rather than shy away from the tasks and duties of a deployed service member, it should be explained how attention to physical fitness, maintaining a healthy routine, and a commitment and pride in good work performance are key factors supporting recovery. Where available, therapy resources that incorporate components of behavioral activation and occupational therapy may reinforce this message. By foregrounding the role of personal effort and responsibility, such interventions are more reflective of a warrior ethos than taking medication alone. PRINCIPLE 2: EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF INDIVIDUAL ACTION The prescription of medication carries such significance that it can impact beliefs regarding the role and mechanisms of other aspects of treatment.9 Service members who experience stress and anxiety related to factors like operational tempo, command climate, and family separation may interpret the reflexive prescription of medication as a signal to stop trying to work on solving or coping with these challenges, and rather see it as a cue to \u201cwait for the medicine to kick in\u201d before re-engaging with their problems. This reaction may not only limit the potential impact of medication but may also in some cases lead to a clinical decline if the period of waiting for a response is characterized by decreased activity and increased social isolation. Whereas the once-promoted \u201cchemical imbalance\u201d theory of antidepressants would support the idea that the medication can treat a problem in isolation, more recent neuroplasticity models of antidepressant effects emphasize the relationship between depression, stress, and the environment10 and the potential for behavioral interventions and therapy to prolong positive brain-based effects.11 This presents a clinical opportunity, and providers should emphasize the particular importance of positive individual action in the immediate period after a medication is started: When you start your medication, you might not notice anything but it is working in the background to make things easier \u2013 just like running shoes don\u2019t make you feel any faster just by having bought them! It\u2019s really important that you work twice as hard on trying to solve some problems now that you are on medication, so that you can really get the most benefit from this treatment This message allows for a more empowering reframing of the other oft-delivered guidance that \u201cmedication can take 4 weeks to kick in.\u201d Rather than viewing this as a period of inevitable stagnation in which the service member must patiently wait for things to get better, it should be viewed as a period in which their own choices\u2014to actively pursue functional recovery and engage in therapy\u2014remain the key factor. The positive impacts of individual action in this period may act synergistically with the well-described placebo phenomena, by which a positive belief in the potential impacts of treatment may serve to amplify and accelerate the appearance of such benefits.12 PRINCIPLE 3: DO NOT SIMPLY REACT A common way in which service members may be misguided in their understanding of the role and mechanism of psychiatric medication is the non-verbal messages that are sent by our prescribing patterns. If doses are increased each time a service member reports persistence of symptoms, this may reinforce the belief that the medication is a central and perhaps sole factor that is thought to be relevant to their recovery. A more helpful reaction in the response of ongoing symptoms could be to state \u201cI am sorry things continue to be difficult. Let\u2019s talk about what has been going on in your life, and what you have been doing in response to try and understand why that might be the case.\u201d It is of course the case that for some service members, an increase in dose or change in medication will be viewed as the necessary factor that will support recovery, but clinical experience suggests that medications are changed far more frequently than stress levels and behavioral plans are reviewed. Deployed environments are also restricted in the number and nature of available medications, placing further importance on making prescribing decisions with care. There is no disadvantage to continuing to emphasize the importance of psychosocial factors even if a decision is ultimately made to adjust a medication. The running shoe metaphor continues to offer mileage here: Let\u2019s think of this like running again \u2013 just because you aren\u2019t getting further or faster, doesn\u2019t mean you need new shoes. Let\u2019s think about what the weather was like this week? And, did you even try and push yourself to run? If the wind was MILITARY MEDICINE, Vol. 188, September/October 2023 237 D ow naded rom http/academ ic.p.com /m ilm ed/article/-10/236/7110830 by Idian Intitute of Tenology Ptna user on 09 Jauary 2024 Resilient Prescribing against you, or you did less than you should have to help yourself, we can\u2019t place the blame on the medication just yet. Forcing a pause in the conversation about medication change will not only improve the quality of clinical decision-making but may also uncover important clinical data. Service members who embrace the perspective should be praised for embodying warrior ethos and can be described as having resilient treatment beliefs. On the other hand, reactions of irritation may suggest the presence of disempowered or even entitled perspectives, in which service members have lost a sense of their own power and responsibility in their recovery. Taking the time to patiently work through this and guide them to a more adaptive perspective may have benefits beyond the present course of treatment. PRINCIPLE 4: EXPLAIN WHAT MEDICATION CAN AND CANNOT DO Service members may reasonably report an experience of a medication \u201cnot working\u201d in response to a range of experiences that fall outside the scope of what even a perfect psychiatric medication could do. When service members report stress related to increasing operational tempo, distance from family, and interpersonal conflict with peers and supervisors, they may be expected to have ongoing negative emotions even in the context of a successful medication trial. It is helpful to explain that medication may help them \u201csee things as they are, not only the bad side,\u201d reflective of antidepressants normalizing effects on negative attentional bias. Nevertheless, medications should not be expected to solve life problems nor is the goal to attempt to suppress all negative emotions. Disentangling whether residual difficulties are the result of treatment failure or ongoing (or worsening) environmental stress may be clinically difficult, but in some ways having the conversation is enough, and may sensitize the service member to the possibility that more of their recovery is going to come from their own actions or a change in their environment\u2014even if a decision is ultimately made to try a medication adjustment. See Table I for a \u201cmedication worksheet\u201d that aims to highlight the specific challenges that a service member is facing and which are thought to be ones that can be addressed by medication, versus those which will benefit from psychosocial interventions alone. PRINCIPLE 5: UNDERSTANDING \u201cSIDE EFFECTS\u201d A resilient perspective on medication relates as much to perceptions of recovery as to perceptions of adverse effects. Service members who are new to taking psychiatric medication may reasonably be anxious about side effects, and there may be a tendency to attribute any negative physical or emotional experience to the effects of a recently started medication. Convincing a service member otherwise after the fact is more difficult than anticipating this conversation in advance. This can take the form of asking the service member to take stock of the recent symptoms, sensations, and discomforts they have experienced in the weeks to month before starting a medication. And then encourage them to think about the challenges they anticipate in the coming weeks, and how they believe their minds and bodies may react to TABLE I. A Medication Reflection Worksheet Intro text The worksheet begins with the text: \u201cPeople have different beliefs about the role of medications in treatment. These include expectations around which problems meds can help with, how much they can help, and how quickly. While medication is often an important piece of treatment, it is only one piece. Even when it is working well for your brain, it\u2019s nearly useless without the hard work of recovery. In this worksheet, we\u2019ll explore which mental health issues you\u2019re struggling with and what you expect out of medications in your treatment.\u201d Current Symptoms The second part of the worksheet asks about current symptoms as follows: \u201cList 5 major issues or mental health symptoms that you would like to see get better. Examples: mood swings, feeling sad or hopeless, sleep, energy, relationships with family/friends, concentration, substance use.\u201d Medication and symptoms The third part encourages reflection on which symptoms are most important, and which are possibly ones that could be helped my medication, using the following prompts: \u201cCircle the issues or symptoms that you think are the most important to make better. Of the 5, which ones do you think can be helped with medications? How much will meds help them? How quickly will",

When service members report stress related to increasing operational tempo, distance from family, and interpersonal conflict with peers and supervisors, they may be expected to have ongoing negative emotions even in the context of a successful medication trial. It is helpful to explain that medication may help them \u201csee things as they are, not only the bad side,\u201d reflective of antidepressants normalizing effects on negative attentional bias. Nevertheless, medications should not be expected to solve life problems\nnor is the goal to attempt to suppress all negative emotions. Disentangling whether residual difficulties are the result of treatment failure or ongoing (or worsening) environmental stress may be clinically difficult, but in some ways having the conversation is enough, and may sensitize the service member to the possibility that more of their recovery is going to come from their own actions or a change in their environment\u2014even if a decision is ultimately made to try a medication adjustment. See Table I for a \u201cmedication worksheet\u201d that aims to highlight the specific challenges that a service member is facing and which are thought to be ones that can be addressed by medication, versus those which will benefit from psychosocial interventions alone.\nPRINCIPLE 5: UNDERSTANDING \u201cSIDE EFFECTS\u201d A resilient perspective on medication relates as much to perceptions of recovery as to perceptions of adverse effects. Service members who are new to taking psychiatric medication may reasonably be anxious about side effects, and there may be a tendency to attribute any negative physical or emotional experience to the effects of a recently started medication. Convincing a service member otherwise after the fact is more difficult than anticipating this conversation in advance. This can take the form of asking the service member to take stock of the recent symptoms, sensations, and discomforts they have experienced in the weeks to month before starting a medication. And then encourage them to think about the challenges they anticipate in the coming weeks, and how they believe their minds and bodies may react to\nTABLE I. A Medication Reflection Worksheet\nIntro text The worksheet begins with the text: \u201cPeople have different beliefs about the role of medications in treatment. These include expectations around which prob-\nlems meds can help with, how much they can help, and how quickly. While medication is often an important piece of treatment, it is only one piece. Even when it is working well for your brain, it\u2019s nearly useless without the hard work of recovery.\nIn this worksheet, we\u2019ll explore which mental health issues you\u2019re struggling with and what you expect out of medications in your treatment.\u201d\nCurrent Symptoms The second part of the worksheet asks about current symptoms as follows: \u201cList 5 major issues or mental health symptoms that you would like to see get better. Examples: mood swings, feeling sad or hopeless, sleep, energy, relationships with family/friends, concentration, substance use.\u201d Medication and symptoms The third part encourages reflection on which symptoms are most important, and which are possibly ones that could be\nhelped my medication, using the following prompts: \u201cCircle the issues or symptoms that you think are the most important to make better. Of the 5, which ones do you think can be helped with medications? How much will meds help them? How quickly will\nthey work?\u201d Alternate ways of coping Here, patients are encouraged to think about ways of coping with the symptoms that will not be addressed by\nmedication: \u201cWhat are other important ways besides medication that these issues can be helped? Think about coping skills you may\nhave learned, such challenging negative thoughts, establishing routines, eating better and exercising, etc.\u201d Pros and cons In this section, patients are simply encouraged to reflect on the pros and cons of starting a medication so that barriers can be worked through before the medication is even started Anticipating good and bad\nfeelings Similarly, in this section, patients are reminded of the fact that even if their medication works well, they may still have\nnegative emotions in between days where things are better: \u201cSo we know that every med has pros and cons. Even if a med works well, you are going to need to ride a few waves of\ngood and bad feelings that may come up. Write down some of the things that may happen and pick a coping skill for each.\u201d\n238 MILITARY MEDICINE, Vol. 188, September/October 2023\nD ow nloaded from https://academ ic.oup.com /m ilm ed/article/188/9-10/236/7110830 by Indian Institute of Technology Patna user on 09 January 2024\nany change in environment or increase in stress. This exercise will sensitize them to the fact that, even in the absence of starting a medication, they have and would likely to continue to experience a range of uncomfortable sensations. This is particularly likely when a deployed environment will include disruptions in sleep-wake cycle, inconsistent access to support systems, and abrupt changes in demand and routine. A plan can then be developed for how these experiences will be managed and a commitment made to not blame them on the effects of the medication (See Table I). Returning to our metaphor:\nNow remember, even in the best-case scenario, running doesn\u2019t always feel good. Some days you will be slower than others. Some days you will get short of breath, and others you may get pain in your joints and muscles. This has always been true for you, and will be true even when you start using your running shoes. Just like running shoes, a medication can\u2019t be blamed for every uncomfortable feeling that you are going to have moving forward.\nThis does not mean to imply that medication side effects are impossible, but rather that there is value in assuming that an uncomfortable experience should be overcome and coped with, rather immediately externalized.\nPRINCIPLE 6: AVOIDING POLYPHARMACY The prescription of multiple psychotropic medications within the same class or for the same indication falls outside the sphere of evidence-based medicine in the majority of cases. This is reason enough to discourage the practice. Service members are unlikely to be cleared for duty if they are prescribed multiple psychiatric medications. And in the context of the present discussion, polypharmacy represents one of the most significant ways in which we may send a disempowering message through our clinical decisions. When ongoing problems are responded to by the addition of more medication, we reinforce the perspective that mental health problems can be solved if we just persist in adjusting and increasing our pharmacologic interventions. This frequently occurs to the exclusion of carefully reviewing changes in the service members\u2019 environment, ensuring adherence to behavioral aspects of their treatment plan, and adjusting the specific psychotherapy treatment plan to better understand reasons for persistence or, even, resistance. This last factor is of particular importance, as a failure to recover while on psychiatric medication may in rare cases be tied to limited motivation to recover. The decision to prescribe multiple psychiatric medications needs to come after a thoughtful consideration of these factors and may necessitate a consideration of whether the ongoing demands of a military environment are reasonable expectations for the service member in question, particularly given regulatory restrictions on medication type and number that apply in deployed settings."

            "text": "The ongoing attention paid to mental health issues is a positive shift that has the potential to enhance the wellness and functioning of our fighting force. The prescription of medication is an important part of mental health treatment, including for service members. However, medication has the potential to both foster and undermine resilience and self-efficacy. Principles outlined in this manuscript offer a roadmap to better prescribing practices that center on the service member\u2019s own agency and capacity and have the potential to amplify the positive impacts of the mental health treatment being provided."
