    "abstractText": "Background: Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) is frequently performed during the diagnostic workup of acute ischemic stroke patients. Yet, ischemic core estimates vary widely between different commercially available software packages. We assessed the volumetric and spatial agreement of the ischemic core on CTP with the follow-up infarct on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) using an automated software. Methods: We included successfully reperfused patients who underwent endovascular treatment (EVT) with CTP and follow-up DWI between November 2017 and September 2020. CTP data were processed with a fully automated software using relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) < 30% to estimate the ischemic core. The follow-up infarct was segmented on DWI imaging data, which were acquired at approximately 24 h. Ischemic core on CTP was compared with the follow-up infarct lesion on DWI using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Dice similarity coefficient (Dice). Results: In 59 patients, the median estimated core volume on CTP was 16 (IQR 8\u201347) mL. The follow-up infarct volume on DWI was 11 (IQR 6\u201342) mL. ICC was 0.60 (95% CI 0.33\u20130.76), indicating moderate volumetric agreement. Median Dice was 0.20 (IQR 0.01\u20130.35). The median positive predictive value was 0.24 (IQR 0.05\u20130.57), and the median sensitivity was 0.3 (IQR 0.13\u20130.47). Severe core overestimation on computed tomography perfusion > 50 mL occurred in 4/59 (7%) of the cases. Conclusions: In patients with successful reperfusion after EVT, CTP-estimated ischemic core showed moderate volumetric and spatial agreement with the follow-up infarct lesion on DWI, similar to the most used commercially available CTP software packages. Severe ischemic core overestimation was relatively uncommon. Wenjin Yang and Jan W.

CTP data were processed with a fully automated software using relative cerebral blood flow (rCBF) < 30% to estimate the ischemic core. The follow-up infarct was segmented on DWI imaging data, which were acquired at approximately 24 h. Ischemic core on CTP was compared with the follow-up infarct lesion on DWI using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) and Dice similarity coefficient (Dice).\nResults: In 59 patients, the median estimated core volume on CTP was 16 (IQR 8\u201347) mL. The follow-up infarct volume on DWI was 11 (IQR 6\u201342) mL. ICC was 0.60 (95% CI 0.33\u20130.76), indicating moderate volumetric agreement. Median Dice was 0.20 (IQR 0.01\u20130.35). The median positive predictive value was 0.24 (IQR 0.05\u20130.57), and the median sensitivity was 0.3 (IQR 0.13\u20130.47). Severe core overestimation on computed tomography perfusion > 50 mL occurred in 4/59 (7%) of the cases.\nConclusions: In patients with successful reperfusion after EVT, CTP-estimated ischemic core showed moderate volumetric and spatial agreement with the follow-up infarct lesion on DWI, similar to the most used commercially available CTP software packages.

            "text": "Computed tomography perfusion (CTP) enables quantification of the blood flow through the brain and is increasingly used in the diagnostic workup of acute ischemic stroke [1\u20133]. Although CTP-estimated ischemic core volume is not recommended to select patients for endovascular treatment (EVT) in the 0\u20136\u00a0 h time window, it is an important determinant to determine EVT eligibility in the 6\u201324\u00a0 h time window [4, 5]. In several previous studies, CTP-estimated ischemic core volume was used to predict outcome of patients within 6\u00a0h after stroke onset for EVT [6\u20138]. Furthermore, the current AHA/ASA and ESO/ESMINT guidelines recommend to use the mismatch between the CTP-estimated core and penumbral volume determine EVT-eligibility in patients who present beyond 6\u00a0h after stroke onset [1, 2].\nVarious previous studies have assessed the volumetric and spatial agreement of CTP-based ischemic core estimations after successful reperfusion using follow-up diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) as a reference [4, 9\u201314]. Commercial software packages from different vendors\u2014 using different perfusion parameters and parameter thresholds for core and penumbra estimations\u2014show discrepant results [15]. An increasingly used commercially available CTP analysis software is the perfusion analysis software available in StrokeViewer [16www. nicol ab. com/ strok eview er]. The StrokeViewer platform is a CE marked platform which comprises various\u2014 FDA-cleared\u2014stroke technology applications including arterial occlusion location detection, collateral status quantification, ASPECTS scoring, hemorrhage segmentation, and analysis of the perfusion status in acute ischemic stroke. Although the diagnostic performance of several applications available on the StrokeViewer platform have been studied and published before [17, 18], the automated perfusion software available in StrokeViewer has not been volumetrically and spatially compared with 24\u00a0h FU DWI in a clinical validation set. Given the increased use of the StrokeViewer platform and the fact that treatment decisions may be based on CTP-estimated results\u2014especially in the 6-24\u00a0 h time window\u2013, it is of\ngreat importance to determine the diagnostic performance of the perfusion algorithm available on the StrokeViewer platform and compare this to the performance of other commercially available software packages. Other commonly used software packages for CTP analysis are Rapid CTP (RapidAI, Menlo Park, CA, USA) and syngo. via (Siemens Healthcare, Forchheim, Germany).\nWe aim to evaluate the volumetric and spatial agreement of CTP-based ischemic core estimations by comparing the results from the StrokeViewer CTP analysis software with follow-up DWI\u2014acquired at a median of approximately 24\u00a0h\u2014using a previously validated method and dataset which was created for validation purposes [13, 14]."

Follow-up infarct lesion was assessed on DWI images (median 23\u00a0h) using a previously published semiautomated segmentation method using a Deepmedic network [20, 21]. All segmentations were visually checked by an expert neuroradiologist (> 20\u00a0 years of experience) who was blinded to all clinical information except for the occlusion side [21]. Apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) maps were consulted to determine if T2 shine-through lesions were suspected to be present on DWI data\u2014using the following threshold: ADC \u2264 620 \u00d7 10\u22126 mm2/s [22]. If necessary, the semi-automated segmentation results were manually adjusted using ITK-SNAP. We decided to use DWI for follow-up infarct assessment since DWI is widely used as an accurate assessment tool for infarct core and considered to be more sensitive for (sub)acute\nischemic lesions compared to fluid-attenuated inversed recovery (FLAIR) [23, 24]."

            "text": "occlusion and successful reperfusion. Severe ischemic core overestimation > 50\u00a0mL by CTP was rare. The value of evaluation on ischemic core with StrokeViewer was comparable with other commercial software packages [13, 15, 31, 32].\nThe spatial agreement between ischemic core estimated by StrokeViewer and follow-up infarct on DWI (Dice 0.20) was comparable with the previously reported agreement between CTP-estimated ischemic core and follow-up infarct on DWI for RapidAI CTP (Dice 0.24) and syngo.via (Dice 0.16\u20130.21, depending on which core estimation approach was used) [14]. However, it should be noted that the agreement of Rapid CTP was assessed using a different dataset, which complicates direct comparison to our findings [13]. Since we used a similar coregistration approach as previously published studies assessing the diagnostic performance of other CTP software package, we aimed to limit any bias which could be introduced by using different co-registration methods [13, 14].\nFurthermore, the spatial agreement between the CTP ischemic core estimated by the StrokeViewer perfusion analysis software and the follow-up DWI lesion was limited. Possible explanations for the limited spatial agreement include infarct growth during the imagingto-reperfusion interval and during the period between baseline imaging and follow-up imaging\u2014particularly\nin patients without complete reperfusion. In addition, echoplanar image distortion, slice thicknesses difference, and suboptimal registration of thick slice images could have affected the spatial agreement.\nThe assessment of ischemic core based on baseline imaging is of great value for clinical outcome prediction of patients with acute ischemic stroke [5, 8, 33, 34] The ischemic core volume estimated by CTP impacts clinical outcome and efficacy of thrombectomy for acute ischemic stroke patients [31, 35, 36]. CTP is widely used in emergency settings because of its widespread availability and relatively short acquisition times compared to MRI. Previous studies showed that CBF corresponded better with the follow-up DWI lesion than other parameters such as cerebral blood volume, time to peak, mean transit time [37\u201340]. A threshold of rCBF < 31% was considered as the optimal threshold in identifying infarct core [37]. However, different postprocessing algorithms from different software vendors could alter the optimal thresholds. RapidAI CTP software, using rCBF < 30% for ischemic core, could assess ischemic core volume more accurately than other commercial software [33]. StrokeViewer CTP software\u2014 using a similar rCBF threshold of < 30% yielded similar moderate spatial and volumetric agreement with follow-up DWI compared to RapidAI software [13].\nFig. 2 Bland\u2013Altman plot comparing the estimated CTP ischemic core volume and DWI follow-up infarct volume. The mean bias (blue), lower (red) and upper (green) limits of agreement are shown with 95% confidence intervals. The bias with 95% confidence intervals is shown in blue. Negative values indicate overestimation by CTP. CTP CT perfusion, DWI diffusion weighted imaging\nDWI was used as a reference standard because of its high sensitivity for infarcted brain tissue, which has been widely accepted in research and clinical practice [12, 24, 41]. Previous studies compared CTP-estimated ischemic core to follow-up DWI using either contemporaneous imaging (i.e., CTP and DWI acquired before treatment and within a short interval between baseline and followup imaging) or compared baseline CTP to follow-up \u2013 post-treatment\u2014DWI imaging comparison [13, 33, 37, 38, 42]. In the current era of endovascular treatment, it is not feasible to acquire contemporaneous baseline CTP and DWI, as this would delay treatment. The timing between baseline and follow-up imaging is an important factor to consider when performing volumetric accuracy studies as the infarct is likely to expand in the time interval between baseline and follow-up imaging. Particularly in patients with incomplete reperfusion after EVT (e.g., eTICI 2b) [43]. We tried to limit the effect of these limitations, but it is likely that infarct growth affected both the volumetric and spatial agreement. Additionally, potential effect of infarct growth during the short interval from baseline imaging to reperfusion remained existent, even though a previous study did not find that spatial and volumetric accuracy was reduced in patients within a short imaging-to-reperfusion time interval [13].\nStrengths of this study include the use of a single acquisition protocol, which reduced the heterogeneity of the CTP source data. Moreover, we assessed the follow-up infarct volume on DWI at a median of approximately 24\u00a0h after reperfusion, which minimizes the influence of infarct volume inflation due to brain edema [43]. Furthermore, DWI is considered the most sensitive and accurate imaging to delineate the follow-up infarct [44].\nSeveral limitations to this study should be noted: First, this was a retrospective study only including patients with follow-up DWI. In the Dutch healthcare system, follow-up imaging (either DWI or CT) is only performed for research purposes in most centers and therefore only sporadically performed in routine clinical practice. In our dataset, the vast majority of patients were included in either the MR CLEAN-NO IV (ISRCTN80619088), the MR CLEANMED (ISRCTN76741621), or the MR CLEAN-LATE (ISRCTN19922220) trial. All included patients underwent follow-up imaging as part of the standard followup imaging protocol of the concerning trial, which were all part of the Collaboration for New Treatments of Acute Stroke (CONTRAST) consortium [30]. Second, we did not compare different thresholds to assess an optimal threshold for StrokeViewer. Third, although the interval from CTP to reperfusion was relatively short and all subjects had successful reperfusion, there was still a potential underestimation of ischemic core\nvolume on CTP due to infarct growth, especially for patients with incomplete reperfusion (i.e., of eTICI 2b). Fourth, we did not evaluate the reproducibility and reliability of StrokeViewer in this study with reference to other software packages. Fifth, co-registration between two different imaging modalities is not optimal and might negatively affect the results of our spatial agreement analysis. Finally, all CTP data in this study were acquired on two scanners developed by a single vendor, hence our results might not be generalizable to different scanners and scanners from different vendors. Last, most patients included in this study presented within 6\u00a0h from the onset and our results might not be generalizable to patients with longer onset-to-imaging intervals. Although CTP is currently not recommended for EVT selection for these patients, it might still be a valuable diagnostic imaging tool in the acute setting with useful implications for outcome prediction of acute ischemic stroke patients."
