    "abstractText": "Some genetic variations in cytokine genes can alter their expression and influence the evolution of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) infection. This study aimed to investigate the association of polymorphisms in cytokine genes and variability in plasma levels of cytokines with the development of tuberculosis (TB) and latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI). Blood samples from 245 patients with TB, 80 with LTBI, and healthy controls (n = 100) were included. Genotyping of the IFNG +874A/T, IL6 -174G/C, IL4 -590C/T, and IL10 -1082A/G polymorphisms was performed by real-time PCR, and cytokine levels were determined by flow cytometry. Higher frequencies of genotypes AA (IFNG +874A/T), GG (IL6 -174G/C), TT (IL4 -590C/T), and GG (IL10 -1082A/G) were associated with an increased risk of TB compared to that of LTBI (p = 0.0027; p = 0.0557; p = 0.0286; p = 0.0361, respectively) and the control (p = <0.0001, p = 0.0021; p = 0.01655; p = 0.0132, respectively). In combination, the A allele for IFNG +874A/T and the T allele for IL4 -590C/T were associated with a higher chance of TB (p = 0.0080; OR = 2.753 and p < 0.0001; OR = 3.273, respectively). The TB group had lower levels of IFN-\u03b3 and higher concentrations of IL-6, IL-4, and IL-10. Cytokine levels were different between the genotypes based on the polymorphisms investigated (p < 0.05). The genotype and wild-type allele for IFNG +874A/T and the genotype and polymorphic allele for IL4 -590C/T appear to be more relevant in the context of Mtb infection, which has been associated with the development of TB among individuals infected by the bacillus and with susceptibility to active infection but not with susceptibility to latent infection.",

            "text": "Tuberculosis (TB) is caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), which is acquired through the respiratory tract and can cause a primary infection of alveolar macrophages or establish a latent infection [1]. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that approximately 10 million people become ill with TB per year worldwide [2]. The evolution of Mtb infection to TB results from a variety of combined factors, such as the virulence mechanisms of the bacillus, the host\u2019s genetics and nutritional status, and vaccination history [3]. Thus, infected individuals may develop latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), which is asymptomatic and nontransmissible, or TB, which is characterized by the presence of clinical symptoms resulting from lung infection and spread to multiple organs [4]. The World Health Organization (WHO) defines LTBI as a state of persistent immune response to stimulation by Mtb antigens without evidence of clinical disease [5,6]. Approximately one-quarter of the global population has LTBI [5]. Thus, individuals with\nBiomolecules 2023, 13, 1541. https://doi.org/10.3390/biom13101541 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/biomolecules\nBiomolecules 2023, 13, 1541 2 of 14\nLTBI represent a reservoir for new cases of active TB [7]. The probability of progression from latent infection to active clinical tuberculosis is determined by bacterial, host, and environmental factors, including: the initial bacillary load, related to the severity of the disease in an index case and the proximity of contact; suppression of cellular immunity induced by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV); tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1) inhibitors; glucocorticoids; and organ transplantation [6]. Mtb infection is regulated by two distinct patterns of T helper CD4+ cell responses, which result in the production of pro-inflammatory (T helper 1, Th1) and anti-inflammatory (T helper 2, Th2) mediators [8]. Initially, a protective immune response is mounted by natural killer (NK) cells and antigen-specific Th1 cells with the production of IFN-\u03b3, which stimulates the antimicrobial activity of infected alveolar macrophages while organizing the formation of the protective granuloma [8\u201310]. However, Mtb may modulate Th1 cell activation, inducing the synthesis of T helper 2 (Th2) cytokines, which are associated with progressive disease [8,11]. The marked production of suppressive cytokines, such as TGF\u03b2 and IL-4, during Mtb infection inhibits phago-lysosome fusion in macrophages and reduces the expression of T lymphocyte-activating molecules [10]. Although the host immune response has been associated with the development of TB, the identification of specific biomarkers that can characterize LTBI is still lacking, as many mediators related to the latency stage also correlate with the acute phase of Mtb infection [12]. Single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the promoter and coding regions of key genes have been associated with susceptibility and/or resistance to Mtb infection. The wildtype IFNG +874A/T polymorphism allele is associated with lower IFN-\u03b3 synthesis [13], and its presence may impair macrophage activation, thus affecting Mtb infection control [14]. High levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) are produced in response to Mtb infection by activated monocytes and macrophages [15]. The wild-type IL6 -174G/C polymorphism is associated with higher levels of IL-6 and has been described as a risk factor for the development of TB [16]. IL-4 and IL-10 are Th2 cytokines involved in the downregulation of IFN-\u03b3 expression and therefore have a deleterious effect in patients with Mtb infection [17,18]. IL4 -560C/T polymorphisms may influence gene transcription and have been associated with increased IL-4 levels [19]. The SNP in IL10 -1082A\u2044G alters the level of IL-10 and interferes with the Th1/Th2 balance [20]. The influence of polymorphisms on the development of diseases seems to depend on factors such as the type of genetic variation (the affected gene and the position where the genetic alteration occurs), the interaction of the effects of various mutations, and, mainly, the ethnic composition of a population [21,22]. The present study aimed to investigate the association of IFNG +874A/T, IL6 -174G/C, IL4 -590C/T, and IL10 -1082A/G polymorphisms and plasma levels of cytokines with susceptibility to Mtb, the presence of LTBI, and the development of TB."

            "text": "Variations in the levels of specific cytokines determine the susceptibility and progression of Mtb infection or containment of the infection. Some cytokines resulting from the activation of T lymphocytes and phagocytic cells, such as IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1, are efficient in controlling infection, while others may contribute to the survival and growth of Mtb or mediate susceptibility to tuberculosis, including IL-4, TGF-\u03b2, and IL-10 [25]. As genes encoding cytokines such as IFNG, IL4, IL6, and IL10 are highly polymorphic, some genetic variations may influence the expression of cytokines and contribute to regulating resistance or susceptibility to TB [20,26]. The study showed an association between the frequencies of the wild genotype for IFNG +874A/T and IL6 -174G/C and the polymorphic genotype of IL4 -560C/T and IL10\nBiomolecules 2023, 13, 1541 10 of 14\n+1082A/G with TB. IFN-\u03b3 levels were more reduced in individuals with TB and higher in the LTBI group, while IL-6, IL-4, and IL-10 levels were higher in individuals with TB and reduced in the LTBI group. There was no statistical difference in the frequencies of investigated polymorphisms and cytokine levels between the LTBI and control groups. IFN\u03b3 levels were more reduced in individuals with the AA genotype for IFNG +874A/T, and the levels of IL-6, IL-4, and IL-10 were higher in carriers of the GG, TT, and GG genotypes for the variations IL6 -174G/C, IL4 -560C/T, and IL10 +1082A/G, respectively. Although this study shows interesting results related to the isolated evaluation of each of the polymorphisms and their association and the influence of polymorphisms on cytokine levels in different groups, the small sample size of the LTBI and control groups represents a limiting factor in the study. The characterization of the LTBI group was also a limitation of the study, since this LTBI group was selected due to the positive result of the TST test associated with the absence of TB symptoms. The interferon-gamma release assay (IGRA) would be a more appropriate test to define the LTBI group, as it uses Mtb-specific antigens that induce the production of IFN-\u03b3 in individuals with previous contact with Mtb, and the result is not influenced by BCG vaccination or exposure to most non-tuberculous mycobacteria (NMT) infections [27,28]. However, according to the WHO, both the TST and IGRA can be used as screening tests for LTBI in countries with high TB endemicity, such as Brazil [29]. According to the Manual of Recommendations for Tuberculosis Control in Brazil (Ministry of Health), the diagnosis of LTBI can be made by TST or IGRA; however, IGRA is recommended only for specific groups, such as HIV-infected individuals and children, not being routinely used to identify LTBI in the general population, as it is less expensive, widely available, and simpler to perform for health professionals [30,31]. As the population included in the study does not meet the criteria for the use of IGRA, the diagnosis was made by TST. The analysis of the IFNG +874A/T polymorphism between the TB and LTBI groups suggested that the increased frequency of the wild-type AA genotype represented a 3-fold greater chance of the individual developing TB among those infected with Mtb; between the TB and HC groups, the presence of the AA genotype was associated with a 5-fold greater chance of the individual acquiring infection and developing the disease. The wild-type AA genotype is associated with lower cytokine levels and may contribute to the establishment of TB. Other studies have observed an association of the wild-type genotype and allele with TB in different populations [32\u201334]. IFN-\u03b3 is fundamental to the protective immune response against Mtb, which is mediated by CD4+ Th1 cells [35]. This cytokine has a major impact on the physiology of infected macrophages and on the biology of phagosomes [36]. Elevated cytokine levels may also promote greater FASL activation and enhance the apoptosis of infected cells [37]. However, a deficient IFN-\u03b3 response is associated with susceptibility to and severity of TB, as it reduces the activation of T-cell responses and the detection of infected cells [14,38]. The presence of the wild-type GG genotype and the G allele for the IL6 -174G/C polymorphism was associated with a 4-fold increased risk for infection and development of TB when comparing individuals with TB and the healthy control. The GG and CC genotypes were associated with higher and lower levels of cytokines, respectively. Our results corroborate a previous study in which the presence of the polymorphic genotype CC was associated with a lower risk of TB [39,40]. However, in a study performed in India, the CC genotype was associated with TB [41], in contrast to our results. It is possible that this divergence is related to the ethnic differences in the population. IL-6 has been identified as a key driver of TB severity and is associated with lung inflammation and lung damage. The cytokine, which is produced by macrophages, inhibits IFN-\u03b3 signaling, contributing to the severe disease phenotype [42,43]. The TT polymorphic genotype for IL4 -560C/T was associated with a greater chance (almost three times) of the individual developing TB among those infected by Mtb (TB vs. LTBI) and of having the infection and developing disease (comparison between the TB and control groups). As the TT genotype was related to higher levels of the cytokine IL-4, this\nBiomolecules 2023, 13, 1541 11 of 14\nresult corroborates information previously described [19,44]. Because the polymorphism induces an increase in IL-4 production, it favors a Th2 immune response and antibody production, which is not an efficient response to control Mtb infection and inhibits the differentiation of Th1 cells, which are effective in combating the bacterium. The IL4 -590C/T polymorphism might affect the ability of macrophages to inhibit infection caused by the bacillus [17]. In addition, increased IL-4 (i) impaired antimicrobial activity due to reduced TNF-\u03b1-mediated apoptosis of infected cells and decreased activity of iNOS (and therefore decreased levels of nitrogen and oxygen intermediates), (ii) increased iron availability for intracellular Mtb, and (iii) increased proliferation of FOXP3+ regulatory T cells, favoring the immunopathogenesis of TB [45]. The GG polymorphic genotype of IL10 -1082A/G was associated with higher cytokine levels in all studied groups, and the highest frequency was observed in patients with TB. Other studies have observed this same association with TB in different populations [20,46]. IL-10 has been reported to limit the effector immune response to Mtb infection through immunosuppressive mechanisms [47]. Production of this cytokine by human macrophages infected with Mtb inhibits phagosome maturation, resulting in impaired bacterial clearance [48] and increased chances of developing active TB [49,50]. Considering that the SNPs are associated with changes in cytokine levels, our results suggest that these polymorphisms may interact synergistically, decreasing the signaling of the Th1 response and therefore interfering with effector mechanisms, leading to a significant enhancement of the pathogenesis of TB [51,52]. In this context, the combination of the allele related to low levels of IFN-\u03b3 (A) and high levels of IL-4 (T) was predominantly associated with the risk of being infected and developing TB (when comparing TB with the HC condition), especially in the AGTA (OR = 3.273) and ACTG (OR = 5.038) combinations. These combinations (AGTA; OR = 2.753) and (ACTG; OR = 4.000) were also associated with the risk of developing TB among those infected with Mtb (in the comparison between TB and LTBI groups). These results suggest that genetic variations may contribute to promoting changes in the levels of Th1 and Th2 cytokines. An inversion of Th1 and Th2 cytokine concentrations was observed between the TB and LTBI groups. In TB, lower levels of IFN-\u03b3 and higher concentrations of IL-6, IL-4, and IL-10 were observed. Conversely, the LBTI condition was associated with higher levels of IFN-\u03b3 and lower concentrations of IL-6 and Th2 cytokines. Previous studies have shown that Mtb modulates the effector mechanisms of the immune response, such as decreasing IFN-\u03b3 production, impairing the activation of alveolar macrophages, and favoring the differentiation of Th2 cells with an increase in the levels of the primary cytokines IL-4 and IL-10 [52]. Furthermore, Mtb also increases IL-6 production in infected macrophages, reducing IFN-\u03b3 effector signaling and contributing to an impaired cellular immune response and impaired infection eradication [53,54]. LTBI appears to result in a balance between the host\u2019s immune response and Mtb activity. Most infected people present a robust Th1 immune response, culminating in the formation of a granulomatous lung lesion that contains the infection and prevents the occurrence of active disease but is not sufficient to eliminate the bacillus [55]. This study showed that individuals with LTBI had a higher protective immune response against Mtb infection than those who had active disease, which was mainly influenced by the IFNG +874A/T and IL4 -590C/T polymorphisms. Furthermore, no differences were observed in the frequencies of polymorphisms and cytokine levels between the LTBI and control groups, suggesting that the genetic variations evaluated are not associated with susceptibility to LTBI. Thus, genetic variations in these cytokine genes may promote susceptibility to active infection and the establishment of TB symptom manifestations. These results reinforce that the immune responses generated against Mtb need to be adequately balanced to eliminate or promote the latency state of the bacillus [51,56,57]. Approximately 5 to 10% of individuals with LTBI progress to active infection during their lifetime [5]. The search for prognostic biomarkers that can predict the risk of active TB in individuals with LTBI is of enormous value for TB control. The identification of a transcriptional profile and\nBiomolecules 2023, 13, 1541 12 of 14\ngene expression signature that distinguished individuals with active TB from those with LTBI highlighted the expression of IFNG as a possible biomarker of differentiation between active and latent forms of Mtb infection [58]."
